1
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,416
Mmm... Dahipuri!

2
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,083
- Let me try that.
- Yes, sir.

3
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,458
- Now, this is what I call a...
- Jalebi!

4
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,875
No! Designer jalebi!

5
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,916
Sweety, I was just looking for you.

6
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,666
Look what I made.

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:28,958
Designer jalebi.

8
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,583
This designer jalebi deserves a selfie.

9
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,750
- Of course!
- Selfie time!

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:39,083
Gather around everyone!

11
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,833
Sweet Selfie!

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,791
The food looks amazing!

13
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,166
Tastes even better.

14
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,000
Has Sweety graduated?

15
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,083
Done with it? She topped the university!

16
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,416
Wow!

17
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,708
Time to find a "Bachelor" now!

18
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,750
It's good you brought her to Delhi.

19
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,875
Weddings are the best places
for matchmaking.

20
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,416
Well, I'm trying.

21
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,666
You let me know if you spot
a decent, caring man

22
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,083
who can look after my girl.

23
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,416
Hey! Come join us!

24
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:24,875
You too, Sweety. Come on!

25
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,041
Forget it!

26
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,375
Enough rehearsing for us young ones.

27
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,291
Call the seniors now!

28
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,208
Wow, so pretty.

29
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,875
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

30
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

31
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,875
Sweety, right?

32
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,958
Hi, I am Kuhu.

33
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:53,125
Actually my brother Raza
is quite smitten by you.

34
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,833
He has done his MBA and works in London.

35
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,625
- Actually...
- Hear me out.

36
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,708
POINT 1: Raza is intelligent.

37
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,250
Earns well.

38
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,083
POINT 2: He's handsome, as you can see.

39
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,666
Our family is shifting to London.

40
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,208
Want to join? You can study there.

41
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,125
Sorry, you were asking about
the play's inspiration.

42
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,458
- No. Play's duration.
- Okay. Sorry...

43
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,750
What's the running time?

44
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,000
- Uh...
- 6 hours? Like your last play?

45
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,250
That play was 1.75 hours long, not 6.

46
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,250
Oh? Seemed like 6.

47
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:31,208
Forget that. Come watch this play.
You'll be my guest.

48
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,500
- O God!
- Sorry?

49
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,375
You were talking about the story.

50
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,916
- So, the guy is from Delhi...
- Got it!

51
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,541
I have enough material now.
It'll make a brilliant write-up.

52
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,755
But, Mr. Mirza,
what I really want to know is...

53
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,916
Are you writing any movies?
Or just long plays?

54
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,750
Oh, and tell me something
about your father's next movie.

55
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,375
- Any juicy gossip?
- Excuse me.

56
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,166
Did the actor and the actress

57
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,833
- check into 2 hotel rooms or 1?
- Hi, Mom.

58
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,583
You never have time to talk to me.

59
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,791
- My play opens in 10 days.
- Sorry...

60
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,708
What happened?

61
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:11,375
That speech you wrote for me.
Shall I wire you the payment?

62
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,875
Rs. 1 lac should be good, right?

63
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:18,166
Mom, stop finding ways to give me money.

64
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,541
I don't need your money.

65
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,833
Oh why!

66
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,083
Your play must be a blockbuster!

67
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,041
For God's sake, he's not a writer.
He can't write to save his life.

68
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,166
Thanks to you, my movie was a disaster.

69
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,541
And now, you're wasting
your time in theatre.

70
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,875
Listen to me, come be an actor.

71
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:41,333
And if you must then
just write a couple of your own dialogues.

72
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,500
Thank you, Papa, but no thank you.

73
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,041
Wow. Such attitude!

74
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,958
No fame, no fortune.

75
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,750
But check out the attitude.

76
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,958
Show me this great theatre of yours.
Flip the camera.

77
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,083
Let me see.

78
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,791
- Hello.
- Turn the camera.

79
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,083
By the way, where are you?

80
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,625
Shall I buy hi-speed connection, darling?

81
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,666
- Hello...
- Sahil, turn the camera.

82
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,166
Finally, they kiss.

83
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,375
Guys, quickly finish your lunch.
Then, let's rehearse.

84
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,208
Sahil! What a play, man. What writing!

85
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:35,083
I bet people will go crazy.
Even small towns, villages will invite us.

86
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,750
Mouth-watering biryani for
the great director of our times!

87
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,875
Well-said.

88
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,750
- Sir.
- Yes?

89
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,416
How about I play "Babita"?

90
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,625
I'll give a mind-shattering performance!

91
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,208
It's a 20-year-old girl's role.

92
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,916
You're way too young for it.

93
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,375
Now, may we do our work in peace?

94
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:06,750
- Get some fresh onions for me.
- You got it!

95
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,333
Fresh chilies for the great director.

96
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,625
Mr. Sahil.

97
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,750
I did a 3-week program

98
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,916
at Amrinder Singh
School of Acting and Emotioning.

99
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,166
You should apply for a refund.

100
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,333
Can you put in a good word for me?

101
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,458
Enough now!

102
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,833
If you bug me anymore,
I'll shut down your catering here.

103
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,041
Ms. Chatro. I'll try...

104
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,166
Come on, man.

105
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,041
I want to discuss that scene.

106
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,250
The Dating App one.

107
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,083
- Ms. Chatro.
- Yes.

108
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,208
No one in the world can cook like you.

109
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,666
Take good care of Mr. Sahil.

110
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,875
He's losing weight. Serve him Laddus.

111
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,208
What can I get for you?

112
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,333
Let's introduce you to our characters.

113
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,666
Meet Mr. NRI from America.

114
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,500
He's in Delhi for a meeting.

115
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,375
And here's Ms. Desi from Haridwar.

116
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,666
She just moved here yesterday.

117
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,541
Looks like a bore.

118
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,916
Overseas Indian!

119
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,708
Oh well, you'll thank me, mister!

120
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,916
Damn it, whose phone is that?

121
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,333
Sahil, please check.

122
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,541
Let me check.

123
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,041
Is there a problem?

124
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,958
We'll do that later.

125
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,416
Dismantle this setup.

126
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,500
Raghu, change the setup to bar scene.

127
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,458
You know,
you chose the best place to hide.

128
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,458
I mean, whether you're hiding
from the world or from yourself.

129
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,291
No better place than a theatre.

130
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,666
But hiding here comes
with this terrible play.

131
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,333
Terrible?

132
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,250
Uh, I've heard the story gets better.

133
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:46,291
Sorry, are you acting in this play?

134
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,041
No, I'm not an actor.

135
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,125
I'm just here for pastime.

136
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,458
No connection with the play.

137
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,875
Just an audience.

138
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:03,833
Your profile pics are misleading.

139
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,541
Why?

140
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,333
Because you look somewhat hot in them.

141
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,083
Wait...

142
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,583
In person, you look super hot!

143
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,625
Well, let me make this clear...

144
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:30,833
Whoever wrote this play
has never been in love.

145
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,250
Real, true love.

146
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,875
Why?

147
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,666
It seems alright, kind of funny.

148
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,791
Yes, I mean it's not bad. It's amusing.

149
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,333
But the romance is superficial.

150
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:50,125
Guys... It's getting monotonous.
It's repeating. Let's take a break.

151
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,250
Isn't it realistic?

152
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,958
This is the trend.

153
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,833
That depth is missing...

154
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,041
Which would make you

155
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,416
hold your partner's hand and not let go.

156
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:13,500
You'd want the love story to never end

157
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,375
to go on and on and on.

158
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,125
Have you ever felt it?

159
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,916
Real, true love.

160
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,791
Sweety!

161
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,041
- You can't go inside. Stop!
- Get out of my way!

162
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,916
Is there another way out?

163
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,125
Yes, there's a backdoor.
What's the problem?

164
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,250
Please show me.

165
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,625
Let's go.

166
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,166
- Which way?
- Sweety!

167
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,291
I'll call the cops!

168
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,666
Let's go fast.

169
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,041
Move.

170
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,208
Sweety!

171
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,125
- How far is the metro station?
- Not too far.

172
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,041
But why're we running?

173
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,458
It's a long, complicated story,
I'll tell you later.

174
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,625
Sweety.

175
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,416
There...

176
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,833
Sweety.

177
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,041
Have you gone mad?

178
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,833
- What happened?
- I don't have a pass.

179
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,791
A week's worth of cardio!

180
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,541
So tell me, why're we running?

181
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,791
I have to get somewhere.

182
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Get where?

183
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,375
British Embassy.

184
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,541
I'm late for the Visa interview.

185
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,208
I have figured it!
The thing missing in that play.

186
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,166
What?

187
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,291
Complication!

188
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,208
What?

189
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,708
I mean... is it really romance?

190
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,833
You swipe on the phone and find love?

191
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,916
The path to true love is complicated.

192
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,291
The tougher the path,
the more magical the story.

193
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,666
Sweety!

194
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,291
Sweety!

195
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Complication!

196
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Sweety!

197
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,375
Sweety!

198
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,958
- Sweety!
- Hold on. Wait.

199
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,041
Talk to me.

200
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,083
I said talk to me.

201
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,083
I said stay back.
This is a personal matter.

202
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,125
Sweety, stop making a scene.

203
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,375
Stay back I said, or I will...

204
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,458
Leave me.

205
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,416
- Sweety...
- Go. You go!

206
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,916
Sweety...

207
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,166
Somebody might get hurt.

208
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,333
My phone...

209
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,500
- What are you guys doing?
- You sit back, old man!

210
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,750
Why're you...

211
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,416
I had bought a new phone. He broke it.

212
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,291
Okay... Take it easy.

213
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,833
I can't get you a new phone.

214
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,333
I'm sorry, sir.
It was a mistake, please let me go.

215
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,416
Write down your address.

216
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,291
This time, I'm letting you off.

217
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:18,625
Next time, I'll book you
for nuisance in a public place.

218
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,083
What...

219
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,958
Sir, if you're leaving him, why not me?

220
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,000
No way!

221
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,833
You're booked for three offences.

222
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,000
My swollen cheek.

223
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,416
Traveling without a ticket
and eloping with his sister.

224
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,083
Sister?

225
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,333
She's your sister?

226
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,500
Sister, is it?
Why didn't you say that earlier?

227
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,541
Is everything okay, sir?

228
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,791
Did Sweety come home?

229
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,083
Yes, long back.

230
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,208
Is that the guy

231
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,333
having an affair with Sweety?

232
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,958
Don't talk nonsense.

233
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,041
- Car keys?
- Here.

234
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,125
Better watch yourself!

235
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,125
And write your address here.

236
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,166
Sir, you heard his sister
is back home. Can I go please?

237
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Sir...

238
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,333
That's him!

239
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,083
Oh right!

240
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,333
You're Bilal Mirza's son?

241
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,041
The Film Producer.

242
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,208
You guys make such amazing films.

243
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,083
- Nice. Very nice.
- There must be a write-up on me.

244
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:29,083
Yes, a small paragraph
next to the obituaries.

245
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,458
He wrote that film... Forget Me Not.

246
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,791
Right!

247
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,875
How can I ever forget that film?

248
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,625
I went to watch it. It was a lovely film.

249
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,208
The second scene put me in deep sleep.

250
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,208
I woke up at the end.

251
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,708
What a useful movie!

252
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,916
Let him go!

253
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,500
Write down your address and go.
Can't keep you from making lovely films.

254
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,916
I offer a small suggestion for free.

255
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,500
You should sell copies
of your movie at the pharmacy.

256
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,041
Chaudhury Manor, Moga, Punjab.

257
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,125
It's an amazing sleeping pill.
You'll make huge sales.

258
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,375
In person, you look super hot!

259
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,625
You must take me to Switzerland
for our honeymoon.

260
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,916
The path to true love is
full of complications.

261
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,750
The tougher the path,
the more magical the story.

262
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,583
Got the story.

263
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,166
Gotta find a complication now!

264
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,458
What?

265
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,875
Find what?

266
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,166
Complica...

267
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,041
Inspiration.

268
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,791
The elusive inspiration!

269
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,375
- You said small towns would invite us.
- Yes.

270
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,083
I've made up my mind.

271
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,125
I'll write my next play in a small town.

272
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,958
We'll cast local actors
and do shows there.

273
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,208
Which town?

274
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,625
Moga, Punjab.

275
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,791
- Wait. Did you say Moga?
- Yes.

276
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,916
That's terrific news!

277
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,916
East or west, Moga is the best.

278
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,333
You know what, I'll join you.

279
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,916
Poor Moga people will
need to be taught acting.

280
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,708
We'll turn them into brilliant actors.

281
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,000
No... Ms. Chatro.

282
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,250
There'll be accommodation troubles.

283
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,833
I will solve all your troubles.

284
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,375
My aunt lives in Moga.

285
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,250
And she loves guests.

286
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,041
It's a win-win for you.

287
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,708
Free stay.

288
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Free cook.

289
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,166
And above all, a mind-shattering actress!

290
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,166
Time to call your aunt.

291
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,916
Moga will never be the same again.

292
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,833
And listen...

293
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:10,416
Keep 10 outfits aside
for our fashion show.

294
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,083
Alright.

295
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,273
- Listen...
- Okay, I'll hang up now.

296
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:22,250
That's why this dish
is called Nouveau Tandoori Chicken.

297
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,833
Because we'll cook
it without using a Tandoor

298
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,625
and without the Tandoori Masala.

299
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,833
Take a tomato and roll it this way.

300
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,333
This brings out its juice.

301
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,583
Now cut the tomato.

302
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,916
And squeeze...

303
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,291
Add a pinch of...

304
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,500
- Rat!
- Where?

305
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,416
Again a cookery show!

306
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,708
You will turn into a woman!

307
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,875
Mom!

308
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,708
The TV doesn't know magic. Give it back.

309
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,083
Apply this sauce.

310
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,166
It will kill you.

311
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:57,208
You should watch such shows.
Look at her lovely outfits.

312
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,291
Such designs can inspire
your fashion show.

313
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,166
Give it back, Mom!

314
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Look!

315
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,750
She is wearing such a nice sari to bed.

316
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,833
They are fooling you.

317
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:18,833
Alright, Joginder. Pay up time.

318
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,291
I need a hot cup of tea.

319
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,333
So, what was the bet this time?

320
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,791
Mr. Chaudhury couldn't
watch the show again

321
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,958
and poor guy lost again.

322
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,166
Okay.

323
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,916
Small-time players!

324
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,583
Bet on something big sometime,
I'll play too.

325
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,500
Who'll let you play?

326
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:43,125
First apply for this club's membership.

327
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,750
The fee is 500 rupees.

328
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,291
I see!

329
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:50,416
So I pay 500 to place bets of 100.

330
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,958
What do I look like to you?

331
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,416
You know what, you should bet
on whether I'll pay 500 or not.

332
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:00,875
No chance.

333
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,916
Thanks to you, I was in lockup all night.

334
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,125
Do I look like an idiot to you?

335
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:20,625
I know very well...

336
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,125
You went to Delhi for that lover of yours.

337
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,916
That whole family is in London now.

338
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,708
So what, you'll run away to London?

339
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,375
No...

340
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,458
Alright, tell me.

341
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,791
Why were you in Delhi then?

342
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,125
You didn't go to any college
for admissions.

343
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,250
Don't even try to lie.
I was right behind you.

344
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,083
You were going somewhere else.

345
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,208
Where did you go?

346
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,125
Speak up!

347
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,458
Now you listen to me, Sweety.

348
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:55,000
And look at me when I'm talking to you.

349
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,458
If you ever step out of the house again

350
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,208
I'll tell dad everything.

351
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:06,458
You can imagine what'll happen then.

352
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,708
You used to love me, Brother.

353
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,875
I still do, I love you a lot.

354
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,208
Why don't you get it?

355
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:25,291
Can you imagine what we'll
go through if this gets out?

356
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,375
We'll be the shame of the town.

357
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,375
You and us alike.

358
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,791
Is that what you want?

359
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:37,125
Whose call is that? Is that...

360
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,791
Done! I'll...

361
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,541
I've been telling you nicely for a year.

362
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,416
But now I'll sort it once and for all.

363
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,458
This bloody internet...

364
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:01,666
Mom's favorite is Brother Babloo.

365
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,458
And brother's favorite is me.

366
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,208
Here take this.

367
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,791
We'll always stay together.

368
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,583
Sweety, hand me the salad.

369
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,625
How was your Delhi trip?

370
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,000
Found any new designs
for the fashion show?

371
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:33,708
Babloo.

372
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,875
Where are you lost?

373
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,416
Dad, there's something
I have to tell you.

374
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,291
Sweety is seeing a Muslim boy.

375
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,791
Oh my God!

376
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,541
Muslim?

377
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,041
Are you serious?

378
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,958
Brother, why're you lying?

379
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,125
Oh, am I lying?

380
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,958
Then why don't you tell the truth?

381
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,291
Do you have something to say?

382
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,083
Come on, tell dad, go on.

383
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,000
Dad, further studies in Delhi
is an excuse.

384
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,166
She goes to Delhi to meet that fellow.

385
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,583
Don't let her out of the house
from now on.

386
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,333
And no trips to Delhi.

387
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:18,958
Or she will run away
and take our reputation along.

388
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,333
Muslim boy?

389
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,500
Is this true, Sweety?

390
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:57,875
Sweety, you were right.

391
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,500
Something was missing
in that writer's story.

392
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,083
I think he needs your help.

393
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,875
And looks like you need his.

394
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,791
I'm here... in Moga.

395
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:13,958
Aunty, here are all your groceries.

396
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,916
- Did you get peanuts?
- Of course, I did!

397
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:20,791
Mr. Sahil, Detective Chatro reporting.

398
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,458
I got all the information.

399
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:26,208
Mr. Chaudhury owns the biggest
clothes factory in town.

400
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:28,791
From saris to underwear.

401
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,250
He makes it all.

402
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:33,541
You could call him
the richest man in Moga.

403
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,750
I have enough underwear.

404
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,166
Did you find the address?

405
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,583
Oh yes!

406
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,250
Here.

407
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,166
What's this?

408
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:49,791
I got a cabbie to draw the Google map
to Chaudhury's manor.

409
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:56,416
You should join the CID.
You'll be on TV every week!

410
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,041
Mr. Chef?

411
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,333
Hello!

412
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,583
Mr. Tomato!

413
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,416
Here...

414
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,750
Hi.

415
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,458
Listen.

416
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,125
Come here.

417
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,625
Give this letter to Sweety.

418
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,708
Mr. Chaudhury's daughter, Sweety.

419
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,583
Thank you.

420
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,208
What?

421
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,375
Oh...

422
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,750
Typical.

423
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,583
Here you go. Okay, keep both.

424
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:29,916
Happy?

425
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,708
Such a nice aroma!

426
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,166
What are you cooking?

427
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,625
Let me taste sometime.

428
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,416
I'll be a frequent visitor, now.

429
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,166
Thank you.

430
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,333
Why would he call me here?

431
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,291
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- No, he's never called us before.

432
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:03,000
You called her?

433
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,541
What's the matter, son?
Is everything okay?

434
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:06,666
Shut the door.

435
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,916
- Why did you call me here?
- At home, Sweety could have heard me.

436
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,166
Sit.

437
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,333
That Muslim boy has come here.

438
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:20,833
Good lord.

439
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:22,416
Dad, there's been some mistake.

440
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,333
No, son.

441
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:26,336
Last night, he gave me this letter for
Sweety, through the kitchen window.

442
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,500
What were you doing in the kitchen?

443
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,375
Playing hockey!

444
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,750
Can't a man go into his own kitchen?

445
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:38,500
A man can go into the kitchen...
Only when the oven needs repair.

446
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,791
- I've been telling you for 50 years.
- I've had it with you, Mother!

447
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:45,750
For God's sake, enough with the kitchen!

448
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,416
Show me that letter.

449
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,375
Oh, the metro guy.

450
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,500
He's given his number.

451
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,416
I'll deal with him.

452
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,333
Don't you worry. I'll show him.

453
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,333
Hello - What's your problem?

454
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:13,083
- Who's this?
- The guy who bashed you in Delhi.

455
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,291
Oh! The mighty Babloo!

456
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:18,208
I know you got a lot of butter
in your veins.

457
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,708
Looks like you didn't get enough
in the metro.

458
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,916
If you have any guts,
tell me your address right now!

459
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,583
Oh, of course, I have!

460
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,333
But you see, I'm smart too.

461
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,416
Look, bro... Stay away from my family.

462
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,583
Sweety doesn't need any help from you.

463
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,500
I know when someone needs help.

464
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,958
And hey, put some butter on your
head too, you might get smarter.

465
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,791
- You bloody...
- Bye.

466
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:45,166
Dad, get Sweety married right away.

467
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,666
To whom? A tree?

468
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,541
This friend of mine. Pankaj.

469
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,500
- He's a great guy.
- Oh please!

470
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:54,208
This Pankaj will need
five-inch heels next to Sweety.

471
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,791
We can find many great guys.

472
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,416
First class.

473
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,125
I know a place.

474
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,791
The site needs your password.

475
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,333
Where's my password, Billo?

476
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,083
Check your locker, ma'am.

477
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,375
Here.

478
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:11,375
That's a torch.

479
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,208
- Oh!
- It needs new batteries.

480
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,250
Yes. Check the other side.

481
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:20,000
Here's the password.

482
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,666
Dev Anand.

483
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,208
Oh, you changed the password?

484
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,708
Wasn't it Joy Mukherji?

485
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,125
That's for Facebook.

486
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,708
- What's your email password then?
- Raj Kapoor?

487
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,416
Dharminder!

488
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,000
Dharminder?

489
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,916
Shall we open your
Insta and Twitter accounts too?

490
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,666
- You can use up all the old actors' names.
- Be quiet!

491
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,833
Look.

492
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,625
Look there,
such handsome guys from Punjab.

493
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,625
Oh wow, check out that one.

494
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:50,666
He and Sweety will make the cutest kids.

495
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:52,791
Looks charming.

496
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,416
Of course.

497
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,416
And that one is so cute.

498
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:57,916
Look at the second one.

499
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,625
I like the third one.

500
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,583
Not bad.

501
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,791
They'll look so good.

502
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,708
I wish I never grew up.

503
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,625
Daddy, I'm back from school!

504
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,083
My bullet train!

505
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,375
Come sit. Tell me all about your day.

506
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,583
You know what daddy,
today I drew Cinderella.

507
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,541
And the teacher gave me a ten out of ten.

508
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,916
Simran said she wants to learn from me.

509
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,291
She'll come over today.

510
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,666
And we'll draw together.

511
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,125
Billo, aren't you done yet?

512
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,958
Almost done.

513
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,291
Good... Be quick.

514
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,916
Let me get some papad.

515
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,125
I knew it!

516
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,416
I knew you were up to this, you idiot!

517
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,208
Always in the kitchen. Always!

518
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,916
Someday, I'll also fall in love.

519
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,375
Someday, I'll be a bride.

520
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,333
I'll also fall in love.

521
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,041
I'll be a bride.

522
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:37,416
Dear God, I hope Gurvinder loves me back.

523
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,583
I'll never have love.

524
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:03,125
I'll always be alone.

525
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:29,458
I have got admission
to London School of Art.

526
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,458
I want to study there.

527
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,250
Babloo told me

528
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:41,000
that boy lives in London.

529
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:45,125
Isn't that why you want to go there?

530
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:48,916
My girl.

531
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,708
We can't let you marry a Muslim boy.

532
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,083
You'll have to deal
with too many problems.

533
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,791
First, you'll have to convert to Islam.

534
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,833
Then, kids.
What religion would they follow?

535
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,708
You'll keep adjusting all your life.

536
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:08,708
Dad...

537
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,791
Dad, I...

538
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,958
I know...

539
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,208
I know what you want to say.

540
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,333
That you can't live without him.

541
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,083
It's the passion of youth talking.

542
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,208
Look at me.

543
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:29,166
When I was young, I also had a passion

544
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,250
to be India's best chef.

545
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,958
Mother didn't let me. So what?

546
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,958
It wasn't the end of the world.

547
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,458
I'm a successful man.
I haven't had a bad life.

548
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,083
"Very reasonable Acting class!"

549
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,958
"Be the next Shah Rukh or Priyanka..."

550
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:03,625
"Classes by the famous
writer and director Sahil Mirza."

551
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:04,958
Famous?

552
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,083
Well! You'll become! Sooner or later!

553
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:11,541
What do you think of the ad?
Mind-shattering, right?

554
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,791
Yes. Completely mind-shattering.

555
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,208
Thank you.

556
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,625
I'll go hand them around.

557
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,791
Aunty, see.

558
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,166
- Hello, Uncle...
- Hello, Mr. Chaubey.

559
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,375
It's cold today, isn't it?

560
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:27,750
Not like yesterday.

561
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,541
Oh no!

562
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,791
Hey! Just a second.

563
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,375
Wait right there.

564
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,166
What's he doing here?

565
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:53,666
Wait...

566
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:55,666
Wait. Listen up!

567
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:57,333
Hey. Stop!

568
00:39:58,875 --> 00:39:59,875
Move.

569
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,500
Wait.

570
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,416
- Move aside.
- Will you listen?

571
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:30,625
Saved yourself?

572
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:34,791
- He could never catch me!
- Narrow escape.

573
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:37,875
I run like a leopard!

574
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,250
Are you done?

575
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:43,666
- You Moga guys love cardio.
- No, I'm from Mathura.

576
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:44,916
I swear.

577
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,333
Please don't hit me.

578
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:48,513
I won't tell the Chaudhurys you live here.

579
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,203
- I promise.
- There's one Chaudhury you have to tell.

580
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,750
Sweety.

581
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:54,833
Ah!

582
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,166
- Come, let's get some juice.
- I love juice.

583
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,333
I gave 200 rupees to the cook.

584
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,291
He kept the money.
But didn't deliver the letter.

585
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:06,958
Rs. 200?

586
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,918
Rs. 200 is what you pay
to watch a Bhojpuri movie.

587
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:14,083
You know what, give me Rs. 500.

588
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,791
I'll do the job.

589
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:20,000
The Chaudhurys have
locked up your girlfriend.

590
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,125
Girlfriend?

591
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,833
Of course!

592
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,083
Don't act surprised.

593
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,041
I'm aware of everything.

594
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,541
I know that Sweety loves you.

595
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,208
But the Chaudhurys are hopping mad.

596
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,875
Because...

597
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:38,458
You're a Muslim.

598
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,083
They broke her phone.

599
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,291
She has no way to leave the house.

600
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:50,625
I'm your only hope. Mr. Chaubey.

601
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,083
Give me a lemon.

602
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,000
Give this to Sweety.

603
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:00,708
Okay.

604
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,750
It's missing the seal.

605
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,083
Seal?

606
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,291
Right.

607
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,083
Don't act naive.

608
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,125
Oh man... You're all the same.

609
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,458
This is hard work.

610
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,916
Not social work.

611
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,458
- Don't you get a salary?
- I freelance on the side.

612
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:22,291
Consider your job done.

613
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:26,125
Sit back, wear 3D glasses,
your romantic movie has begun!

614
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:55,791
Sweety...

615
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,166
Sweety, turn over.

616
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,000
I believe we can help each other.

617
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,291
Do come.

618
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,875
Your Delhi Metro friend, Sahil Mirza.

619
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:14,958
Joginder, how about a grand bet!

620
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,208
Rs. 3000!

621
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,666
- Rs. 3000?
- Yes!

622
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:22,416
- They're planning Sweety's wedding.
- Right.

623
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:25,416
Who do you think she'll marry?

624
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:30,041
Oh, that's easy. Babloo's friend, Pankaj.

625
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,541
I heard Babloo talking to him.

626
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,666
Alright. Come sign here.

627
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:36,125
Sign? That's new.

628
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,291
Well, it's a grand bet.
We need a contract.

629
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:39,416
Put your initials.

630
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,291
Here you go.

631
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:47,541
And I bet it'll be a guy
from the matchmaking app Banihal.

632
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,666
So?

633
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:50,833
Rs. 3000?

634
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:52,541
Yes.

635
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,250
Now that's a real bet!

636
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:56,875
Count me in.

637
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:59,708
It's not free-for-all.

638
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:02,083
What about that membership fee?

639
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,083
Rs. 500.

640
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:07,916
Come on. Pay up.

641
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:11,250
Out with it... Crisp bill!

642
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,291
Alright, place your bet.

643
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:17,250
I bet the guy won't be either
of the guys you say.

644
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,833
Mr. Prophet! That's not how it works.

645
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,250
Give us a name.

646
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,666
Oh sure!

647
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,250
How about you write...

648
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,583
Mister... X.

649
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,541
Mr. X.

650
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,500
So it's a deal!

651
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,708
Rs. 3000!

652
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,166
Grandma.

653
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:44,541
I've cooked spinach. Want to taste?

654
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:45,875
Later.

655
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:50,291
This flyer came in today.

656
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,208
Sounds like fun.

657
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:53,458
Can I join it?

658
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,958
Where are my... Reading glasses?

659
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,291
On the table outside.

660
00:44:58,416 --> 00:45:01,000
Pineapple cake, not chocolate.

661
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:04,083
And listen, fresh pineapple.

662
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,333
Hanging up.

663
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:16,458
- Where's my special spice?
- Here.

664
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:25,708
Oh wow!

665
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,875
Theatre group in Moga!

666
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,458
I knew it!

667
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,083
I just knew that...

668
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:37,083
Someday, Moga would become
the Bollywood of Punjab.

669
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,041
It's coming true.

670
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:41,041
You know...

671
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:46,166
Your grandpa tried every
new design of his company on me first.

672
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,375
He would call you Shashikala.

673
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,333
Shashikala.

674
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,541
Go ahead, join.

675
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,083
Uh, I'll keep that.

676
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,208
You can join the class.
We'll go too, Billo.

677
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,750
- Let's all join it together.
- Okay.

678
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:04,083
I'm a really good cook.

679
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:08,250
If he was still around today,
he would call me Master Chef.

680
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:11,958
Hello, everyone.

681
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,750
I'm Sahil Mirza.

682
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,166
I'll be your acting coach.

683
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,083
- This is my assistant, Ms. Chatro.
- Hello.

684
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,333
I just told them.

685
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:24,666
Oh... Shall I tell the rest?

686
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,250
Bursting with talent.

687
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:33,958
That's true.

688
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,375
So, we'll practice some acting methods...

689
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:39,291
Acting?

690
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,333
Hello, I'm Sahil.

691
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:43,958
- Hello.
- Hello.

692
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,541
I'm Gifty Chaudhury.

693
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:48,833
And she is Sweety, my granddaughter.

694
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,083
- Hi.
- I am Billauri.

695
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,000
You can call me Billo.

696
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:56,375
Great. Please fill these forms.

697
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,083
Sweety...

698
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,666
That's a very nice name... Gifty.

699
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:03,166
After all, I was a gift for my family.

700
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:06,958
So, we'll practice some acting methods

701
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,833
and hopefully get to know
each other better.

702
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:11,791
Right! In the workshop...

703
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:13,125
So all set then?

704
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,041
Let's start the class!

705
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,625
Louder.

706
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:21,250
Put that breakfast to good use.

707
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,041
Louder.

708
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:26,875
Now, how does a dog bark?

709
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,041
- Show me how a dog barks.
- Me?

710
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,125
A dog's bark.

711
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,541
How do I do it?

712
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,333
Come on.

713
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:37,500
Now, show me how a cat meows.

714
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:42,083
So, we pay him Rs. 250 to learn barking?

715
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:45,333
In order to act, the dialogues
must come from your heart.

716
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,125
"Turn the lights off."

717
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:51,625
"I can't look at you when I speak."

718
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,166
Wow!

719
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,100
So who's going to say the next dialogue?

720
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,791
- Me. Me.
- Yes, of course.

721
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:01,291
"Don't you get it, Rahul?"

722
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,125
"Everything goes!"

723
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,083
Very lucky!

724
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:10,750
"Love is a bed of thorns..."

725
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,916
"And I want to lie on it."

726
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,541
That was the best!

727
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:17,541
Best ever!

728
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:18,958
Sweety, say a dialogue.

729
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:21,000
- No...
- You can do it.

730
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:22,875
- Oh God!
- Come on.

731
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,500
"I make offers that you can't refuse."

732
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:29,083
"They call me Godfather!"

733
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,916
Oh wow!

734
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:35,333
Amazing!

735
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,333
Wow!

736
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,333
Now that I'm in Moga...

737
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,458
Can you tell me your long,
complicated story in short?

738
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,416
What's going on?

739
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:52,375
You asked me if I'd ever felt true love...

740
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

741
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,750
Sweety?

742
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:59,333
Let's go, it's getting late.

743
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,000
Uh, see you tomorrow same time.

744
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,750
No, sir. Not tomorrow.

745
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,791
There's a party at our place tomorrow.

746
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:09,750
It's my birthday. You must come.

747
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,500
We'll get a DJ, it'll be fun!

748
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:14,541
Yes.

749
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:15,833
You're all invited.

750
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:17,791
Especially you, Chatro.

751
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,291
Bye.

752
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,083
See you tomorrow.

753
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,708
Bye.

754
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,125
Bye, Sweety.

755
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,333
Mr. Babloo, your friend's here.

756
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:49,500
Pankaj! How are you my friend!

757
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:53,125
Come meet my sister.

758
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,250
Chicken Tikka's ready.

759
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:14,083
Now for the Paneer Tikka.
Your service is slow, man.

760
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:21,833
Mr. Caterer, this sauce is nice.

761
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:27,125
But if I add one more thing,
it'll become outstanding.

762
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,375
Buddy, get me a tomato.

763
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,125
Now, this tomato...

764
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,208
Roll it gently.

765
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,750
With love.

766
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:41,583
This will stir up its juices.

767
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,166
Now, slice it.

768
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,291
And squeeze the juice.

769
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,208
I like your work.

770
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,833
You should give me your card.

771
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:01,750
I can refer you to people.

772
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:06,833
Uh, I'm Balbir Chaudhury.

773
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,625
Owner of this bungalow.

774
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:12,291
Oh, the guy who makes underwear!

775
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,708
I mean, garment factory!

776
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:17,916
Don't be.

777
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,750
Someone's got to make underwear.

778
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,500
So, cooking is a hobby?

779
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:27,041
Well, I wanted to be a chef.
But my mother wouldn't have it.

780
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,291
I was told to stay miles away from
ginger and garlic.

781
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,083
What?

782
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,125
Nothing in the world smells
better than roasted ginger and garlic.

783
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:38,333
Really?

784
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:09,416
We were gossiping about Dev Anand.

785
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:11,666
The family from the matchmaking app...

786
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,583
Your would-be groom is here!

787
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,208
Hello. All well?

788
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:25,708
Mother!

789
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:28,791
What happened?

790
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,791
He has gatecrashed our party.

791
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,166
Who?

792
00:53:32,291 --> 00:53:33,875
Grey jacket. Did you invite him?

793
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,833
Yes, he's our acting coach.

794
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:38,875
No! He's the guy Sweety loves.

795
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:40,458
Oh Lord!

796
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:42,000
Throw him out.

797
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,500
Let's find him.

798
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,791
Sweety...

799
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Sweety...

800
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:54,583
Dad...

801
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:59,625
- Bless me.
- Live long.

802
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:15,041
That one.

803
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,166
Sweety.

804
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:33,125
Sweety.

805
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,708
Finally.

806
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:39,083
We don't have much time.

807
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,583
Your cook saw me.

808
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:44,833
I don't know
when you'll tell me your long story.

809
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:49,166
But let me tell you a short story.

810
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:50,958
My story.

811
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,000
No, I'll sit here.

812
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,958
Bed later.

813
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:02,458
You know, Sweety...
I've been unlucky for a long time.

814
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:07,000
But now finally,
it feels like my luck is changing.

815
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:10,833
First, Mr. Chaubey told me.

816
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,166
Now again, I heard in the party that...

817
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,958
I am the Muslim guy you love.

818
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:20,916
Sahil...

819
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:23,958
But...

820
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,791
Well, we're in the same boat.

821
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:34,041
Listen to me, Sahil, this is...

822
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:36,500
Sweety, you were right.

823
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:40,291
The writer of that play
had never felt real love.

824
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,875
He was a fool.

825
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,958
- Sahil...
- By the way...

826
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,958
I'm that fool.

827
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,625
Sahil, just listen...

828
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:52,375
If I hadn't met you,
I would've never believed that

829
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:57,708
just one meeting can change
people's lives.

830
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,958
Like our lives have.

831
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,833
- Sahil!
- Yes, my love.

832
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,166
I've had enough!

833
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,250
Marry Pankaj. Marry the Muslim boy.

834
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:10,166
The Banihal App guy.

835
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,333
My head's about to explode.

836
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:20,041
Brother Babloo lied to everyone
that I have a Muslim boyfriend.

837
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:22,666
I have no Muslim boyfriend.

838
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:26,041
I have no boyfriend whatsoever.

839
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:30,750
Why does everyone have a one-track mind?

840
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:36,375
Why is loving a guy my only option?

841
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:44,750
I... love... a girl.

842
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:51,833
What?

843
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:02,333
What?

844
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:17,833
Sweety...

845
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:16,416
I'm sorry, there'll be no more classes.

846
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:17,708
Why?

847
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:21,875
Ms. Chatro will refund your money.

848
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,458
Ms. Chatro...

849
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:26,750
Come tomorrow for the refund.

850
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,458
Get moving. The class is canceled.

851
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,583
- Hello.
- Hello, Sahil. Hi.

852
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,125
Bad news, man.

853
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,916
The play tickets are not selling.

854
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:08,541
We had to cancel the show.

855
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:10,666
The sponsors went back on their word.

856
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:14,500
There was nothing we could do.

857
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:15,791
Okay, bye.

858
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:19,458
Mr. Chef?

859
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,791
Balbir Chaudhury, Sweety's father.

860
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:26,541
Sorry, sir. I had no idea.

861
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:27,875
It's alright.

862
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:29,458
It's fine, son.

863
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:33,041
There is nothing wrong in being a chef.

864
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:35,083
Cooking is an art.

865
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:39,041
But seeing a girl without
her family's wishes.

866
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,250
That's not okay.

867
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:47,666
I don't have anything against Muslims.

868
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:51,750
In fact, our company
makes the trendiest Burqas.

869
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,875
My accountant is Muslim. Hamid.

870
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:57,833
The most reliable man in the company.

871
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:02,166
But son, inter-religion marriages are...

872
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:03,291
I...

873
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:04,708
I understand, sir.

874
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,583
And I'm very sorry for all this mess.

875
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,625
I... I'm leaving tomorrow.

876
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:19,583
You're a good kid.

877
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,416
See you, son.

878
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:23,750
Bless you.

879
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,541
Son...

880
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:33,208
That lady who came with you
to the party last night...

881
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:35,916
- She's a caterer, right?
- Ms. Chatro?

882
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:37,750
She gave me her card.

883
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:41,666
- But I think I've misplaced it...
- Mr. Sahil, I've sorted it all.

884
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:50,041
I...

885
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:53,208
I lost your card.

886
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:54,541
Card?

887
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:57,541
But I didn't give you my card.

888
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,500
I see.

889
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:02,166
That's why I couldn't find it.

890
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:10,375
Chaubey, working hard.

891
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,416
Yes, cleaning up.

892
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:14,166
This scooter needs cleaning too.

893
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,000
Come here, I need you for a second.

894
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:18,250
Sign this.

895
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:24,041
- What is it?
- You see, you and I are exchanging bets.

896
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:26,541
Now I'm going to bet on Mr. X.

897
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:29,625
I see... You think I'll do it?

898
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:32,208
Do you think I'm a big...

899
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:34,458
Don't waste my time. Stop daydreaming.

900
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:35,666
I see.

901
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:42,791
So, I must've been daydreaming when
I saw you taking Mr. X to Sweety's room.

902
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,291
I saw everything.

903
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:46,583
How did you see that?

904
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:50,541
Will you sign? Or should I tell Babloo?

905
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,583
He'll send you packing back to Mathura

906
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:54,875
and you can spend your life
chanting hymns in Vrindavan.

907
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:58,166
Oh, of course I'll sign!

908
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,208
No big deal. There you go.

909
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:01,750
Now, wash my scooter too.

910
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:05,041
Mr. Chaubey, can I use your phone?

911
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:07,250
I have to make an urgent call.

912
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:08,458
Just a second.

913
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,500
Oh no.

914
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,291
You know, Billo sat down on
my phone last night.

915
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
It broke into pieces.

916
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:18,833
I have to buy a new one.

917
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,333
Sorry...

918
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:25,666
You just wait!

919
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:27,458
I'll deal with you later.

920
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:28,666
Sweety?

921
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:29,916
Sweety.

922
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:31,583
Use this.

923
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,458
And if you need to go somewhere.
I can take you on my scooter.

924
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:38,333
Thank you.

925
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:46,583
Mr. Sahil, my acting career
had just begun and you've ended it.

926
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:53,833
Ms. Chatro, you are not a good actress.
I am not a good writer.

927
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:57,000
The sooner we accept that, the better.

928
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,666
Not so soon.

929
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:00,625
Practice makes a woman perfect.

930
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:02,625
Your phone.

931
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,166
That girl Sweety had called.

932
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,291
What did she say?

933
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,041
That she wants to meet you.

934
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,333
I told her you're leaving.

935
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,750
- Then?
- She's one crazy girl.

936
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:18,041
She said she'd still wait for you all day.

937
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,791
At the Gurudwara.

938
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:43,458
I'm sorry for laughing that night.

939
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:46,125
I was drunk. I'm really sorry.

940
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,333
Don't worry.

941
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,583
You're not the first person
to laugh at me.

942
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:54,250
It's a joke to everybody.

943
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:10,458
I guess people laugh at

944
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,166
what they don't understand.
A guy with a girl is natural.

945
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,958
But girl and girl?

946
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:18,875
Sorry, I'm just saying...

947
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:25,250
I know, I've grown up with
this very question.

948
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,000
I often ask God...

949
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,375
Why am I this way?

950
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:36,583
It was all good when I was little.

951
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,958
Daddy gave me a new name.

952
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,583
Bullet train.

953
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,291
Happy Birthday to you.

954
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:44,041
I had a lot of friends.

955
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:46,916
But one very special.

956
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,125
Gurvinder.

957
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:51,250
She loved to talk.

958
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,958
And I loved listening to her.

959
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:59,458
Please God, tell Gurvinder to love me too.

960
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:02,958
Once, I stayed up all night
and made a card for her.

961
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:04,791
I was going to give it to her.

962
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:09,875
That's when I realized
she was not like me.

963
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:15,875
To her, I was only a friend.

964
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:19,375
After that, my diary took her place.

965
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,791
I used to hide
all my thoughts and dreams in it.

966
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,458
Sweety's here...

967
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:43,375
They made up their mind
that I was not normal.

968
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,125
As time passed, I realized
that I didn't fit in with them.

969
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,375
In fact, I didn't fit in with anyone.

970
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:08,125
There was one other like me...

971
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,291
He too didn't fit in.

972
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:14,708
Who do you like more
SRK or Hrithik Roshan?

973
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:16,166
Kareena Kapoor!

974
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:24,041
Everybody teased us.

975
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:28,041
But at least we had each other.

976
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:32,708
One day, I was looking for Brother Babloo.

977
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:35,583
Come on, show us your catwalk.

978
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,625
Show us or I'll slap you! Come on.

979
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,458
Please. Please let me go.

980
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,916
- Please.
- Take off his shirt.

981
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,041
Take it off.

982
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,083
Yes!

983
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,875
Now, let's see the catwalk!

984
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,541
Oh my! Check out the damsel!

985
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:56,208
Do it again.

986
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,791
Encore!

987
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:05,958
I felt as though I was the one
brother was slapping and laughing at.

988
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:08,208
Hey, enough. Come, let's go.

989
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:11,125
These type of kids are very dirty.

990
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,166
Such kids are like faggots.

991
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:14,833
They pollute other kids' minds.

992
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:16,625
We're doing this to reform him.

993
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:21,458
That day I told myself
that I must always hide my truth.

994
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:25,041
Because people like me are dirty.

995
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:29,541
Why did you make me like this, God?
Please reform me.

996
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:32,208
I had never been so lonely.

997
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,708
My life became a prison.

998
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,333
I would never be loved.

999
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:45,000
One thing was clear to me.

1000
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:47,458
I'd always be alone.

1001
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:52,041
Then last year...

1002
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,583
Last year, I met Kuhu.

1003
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,541
- Kuhu.
- Sweety, right?

1004
01:07:58,708 --> 01:07:59,875
Hi, I am Kuhu.

1005
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,750
Actually, my brother Raza is
quite smitten by you.

1006
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,916
He has done his MBA and works in London.

1007
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:11,125
- Actually...
- Hear me out.

1008
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,791
POINT 1: Raza is intelligent.

1009
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:15,333
Makes a lot of money.

1010
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,291
POINT 2: He's handsome, as you can see.

1011
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:29,333
Actually, I'm also going
to London for further studies.

1012
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,208
Shall I tell you a secret?

1013
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:37,041
Whenever I had a crush on any girl...

1014
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:42,875
Yes, a girl!

1015
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:52,416
When I met her, I realized
that I could have happiness too.

1016
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:57,916
Until you don't find true love, Sahil,

1017
01:08:58,166 --> 01:09:01,708
we have no clue what's
missing in our life.

1018
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,875
I was lost in my thoughts

1019
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,666
and didn't notice that
Brother Babloo was watching me.

1020
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:30,208
My happiness was short-lived.

1021
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,791
I've been watching you since I was a kid.
You'll bring shame to the family.

1022
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,375
Think of dad's reputation.

1023
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,083
Hugging girls out in the open!
What will people say?

1024
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:41,458
I keep screaming like a madman.
And you just sit and sulk.

1025
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:42,625
It's a disease.

1026
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,625
Can't you cure this disease?

1027
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,500
And yet, I couldn't stop myself.

1028
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:52,291
I secretly started going
to Delhi to meet her.

1029
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,250
Is there anything I can do for you?

1030
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,125
You're the first guy who
I have shared my truth with.

1031
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,833
You felt like a friend I never had.

1032
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:05,583
I didn't want this to end
with you laughing at me.

1033
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:09,041
I have no other expectations.

1034
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,458
Sweety...

1035
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:15,125
I came here looking for a girlfriend.

1036
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,375
Sahil.

1037
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,416
But I found something even better.
I found a friend.

1038
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:34,208
Sweety.

1039
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,500
What's your plan now?

1040
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:42,250
Kuhu says there's no life for us here.

1041
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,791
She wants me to move to London with her.

1042
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,458
So, either I escape from Moga

1043
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:51,041
or just escape everything.

1044
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,541
End the mess.

1045
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:58,458
Everything as in the world?

1046
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:02,458
Sweety.

1047
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:04,541
This is nonsense!

1048
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:08,541
There will be no escape.

1049
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,541
Give me some time to think.

1050
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:21,000
You'll get me in trouble.

1051
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:27,750
Hello.

1052
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:30,791
Hello.

1053
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:35,875
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

1054
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:40,625
Sorry, I'm always running late.

1055
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:41,958
Oh, no problem.

1056
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,708
Ladies have a right to be late.

1057
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,791
- Well...
- Well...

1058
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:57,000
Our company is doing a fashion show.

1059
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:03,666
If you could try one of our designs.

1060
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:06,041
Oh... Thank you.

1061
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,208
It's worth a try.

1062
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,833
So sweet of you.

1063
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,083
Speaking of sweet...

1064
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:20,125
I made something for you.

1065
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:26,791
Ma'am, we don't allow outside food.

1066
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:28,958
But this is not outside food.

1067
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:30,541
It's homemade.

1068
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,208
Sir, I'm sorry but...

1069
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:33,791
Just chill, Minty.

1070
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:38,416
Chaudhury Garments will send you
free clothes for a year.

1071
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:41,500
- Thank you.
- Now, can I eat and enjoy?

1072
01:13:45,416 --> 01:13:49,666
I've noticed you have a heart of gold.

1073
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:53,625
It's your influence.

1074
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:01,291
Oh wow.

1075
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:06,750
You should've been a chef
at some five-star hotel.

1076
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,500
Oh, thank you.

1077
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,416
Actually, cooking was just a hobby.

1078
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:16,625
My real passion is acting.

1079
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:21,125
If my parents hadn't got me married...

1080
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:25,416
I could've been India's top actress.

1081
01:14:27,166 --> 01:14:28,333
You're married?

1082
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:31,416
Was. I got divorced last year.

1083
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,416
Kids had left the nest.

1084
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:37,500
I said to myself, I spent
22 years pleasing others.

1085
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,208
Now, it's time to live for myself.

1086
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,208
Well-said.

1087
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:45,041
In fact, I told my kids...

1088
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,250
Marry if you want to.

1089
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,750
Marry whoever you want to.

1090
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:52,291
And don't marry if you don't want to.

1091
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:57,000
Religion, caste,
social status are all irrelevant.

1092
01:14:58,458 --> 01:14:59,875
Just make sure...

1093
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:04,083
Whoever you marry is a kind person

1094
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:05,916
and fills your heart with joy.

1095
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:07,666
But you see...

1096
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:09,000
No "you see"!

1097
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:12,208
This is the problem with Indian parents.

1098
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:14,500
They're busy living
their children's lives for them.

1099
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:17,708
Why don't they live their own lives?

1100
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:20,541
And let the children live theirs.

1101
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:25,916
- Will we get dinner by breakfast time?
- Just two minutes.

1102
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,500
We have guests.

1103
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:32,041
Guests?

1104
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:40,583
Oh no!

1105
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,500
It's no one.

1106
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:44,416
Please. Come.

1107
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:45,666
Welcome.

1108
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,083
Hello.

1109
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:53,333
You've graced our home.

1110
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,875
How is your kind self, son?
In good spirits?

1111
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,250
Why's this rascal here?

1112
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:58,541
Calm down, Babloo.

1113
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:02,750
- Hello. How do you do?
- Fine, thank you.

1114
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,875
Isn't that a design from our fashion show?

1115
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:07,833
See! It's already getting popular.

1116
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:10,166
Balli, what's going on here?

1117
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:12,041
Why have you invited them?

1118
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:14,166
They are guests.

1119
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:15,875
Set the table.

1120
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:18,583
What're you waiting for?
Set the table. Let's eat.

1121
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,541
Please come.

1122
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:22,916
Do sit.

1123
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:32,426
Do start.
Please come and join us for dinner.

1124
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:33,666
The food will get cold.

1125
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:41,750
Sahil, I've been training
in your language, Urdu.

1126
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:46,500
Soon I'll have a rendezvous with
your beloved mother and father.

1127
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:50,000
Son...

1128
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:55,833
I declare Sweety's...

1129
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:57,958
Just a minute.

1130
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,750
- Nuptials with you.
- What?

1131
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:02,791
Dad?

1132
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,375
I know that you're a kind person.

1133
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:07,791
Just fill her heart with joy, son.

1134
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,708
What is this nonsense?

1135
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,041
Marry a Muslim boy?

1136
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:12,958
Wait a sec, Grandma.

1137
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:15,041
Is Sweety ready for this marriage?

1138
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:16,500
Sweety, are you?

1139
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:18,125
Of course, she is!

1140
01:17:18,541 --> 01:17:20,958
They feel adulation for each other.

1141
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,458
They feel yearning, rapture.

1142
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,375
He is her paramour. Right, son?

1143
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:30,083
I didn't carry my dictionary today.

1144
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:33,000
What's wrong with you, son?

1145
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:34,125
No, Grandma!

1146
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:35,416
Let them do it.

1147
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:36,958
This solves everything.

1148
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:39,333
Sweety's happiness is key.

1149
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,000
She'll get married.

1150
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,208
She'll have children.

1151
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:45,083
I can already hear
kids yelling 'Uncle Babloo'.

1152
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:46,333
But, son...

1153
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:47,250
Grandma...

1154
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:50,000
- See, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan.
- Salman Khan?

1155
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:51,916
Dad, he's an eternal bachelor.

1156
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:55,166
But the others married Hindu girls!

1157
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,958
So, why can't he?

1158
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,000
- Of course!
- No, just a minute...

1159
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,750
No, this is wonderful news!

1160
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:02,083
Wedding bells are ringing.

1161
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:03,833
Dad, time for dessert.

1162
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:05,208
Let's have some sweets.

1163
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:07,000
Billauri!

1164
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:11,541
Come on, pay up Rs. 3000 each.

1165
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:13,375
Not so soon.

1166
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:16,208
Let the marriage happen.
Let the honeymoon begin.

1167
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,666
Only then you'll get the money.

1168
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:22,541
Who says you need to get married
before starting the honeymoon?

1169
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:24,833
Naughty you!

1170
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:26,000
Turn down the grin!

1171
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:28,125
This is fine.

1172
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,791
If you say yes, I'll marry you.

1173
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:32,916
What?

1174
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,875
No... Sweety. What're you saying?

1175
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,833
Did you see their faces?

1176
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:42,958
Daddy, Brother Babloo...

1177
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:47,083
I've never seen brother
this happy in years.

1178
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:49,291
Nobody's life is perfect.

1179
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,958
This is the least I can do for my family.

1180
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:53,083
What rubbish!

1181
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:56,083
Stop with this sacrifice business.

1182
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:00,125
Just tell them the truth.

1183
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:02,000
I'm sure they'll understand.

1184
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:04,500
Remember they said your happiness is key.
Right?

1185
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,791
And what shall I tell them?

1186
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,500
That I'm in love with a girl?

1187
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,875
I can't let dad become
the laughing stock of Moga.

1188
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,125
Sweety...

1189
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,666
I don't know.

1190
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:20,000
It's okay if you won't.

1191
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,708
I'll marry that Pankaj guy.

1192
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:27,416
Sweety...

1193
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:30,541
Damn...

1194
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,125
How are you, my dear mom?

1195
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:47,541
Wow! What a surprise!

1196
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:51,708
You answered my phone and called me dear?

1197
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:54,000
Why do you keep calling your useless son?

1198
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:56,041
Wise words, for a change.

1199
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:01,041
Sahil, is everything okay?

1200
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:03,208
How's your play coming along?

1201
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:05,041
Play got canceled, Mom.

1202
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:07,166
That's why I'm saying I'm useless.

1203
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:09,666
Just wasting my time.

1204
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:12,291
Tell me something new.

1205
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:15,916
I'm of no use to myself, nor anyone else.

1206
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,125
I'm a loser.

1207
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:23,041
Well, Sahil, let me tell you a secret.

1208
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:27,333
Half of me worries for you,
the other half is full of pride.

1209
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:31,500
You could've had a very comfortable life.

1210
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:33,791
But you chose to follow your heart.

1211
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:37,750
Put up with your dad's mocking,
refused to take money from us.

1212
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,541
You've struggled so much.

1213
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:42,958
But you never gave up.

1214
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:45,125
So don't give up now.

1215
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:49,000
Besides, my boy is very talented!

1216
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:52,708
Remember, you once wrote a story on me.

1217
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:54,958
I still read it sometimes.

1218
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,708
It won the contest, remember?

1219
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:03,666
You know, Mom, I just realized why it won.

1220
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:04,583
Why?

1221
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,791
Because it wasn't fiction, it was truth.

1222
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,458
Then don't write stories.

1223
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:11,541
Write a truth.

1224
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:26,125
- Did you make this?
- Yes.

1225
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,250
It's sugar-free.

1226
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:29,416
Sir, you're planning
a fashion show, right?

1227
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:30,916
Yes.

1228
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,208
I was thinking,
how about a musical play instead?

1229
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,083
- Play?
- Yes.

1230
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,666
I'll write it for you!

1231
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:40,500
But... What use is that?

1232
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:43,375
When was the last musical in Moga?

1233
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:44,791
Moga...

1234
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:48,000
- Mother, when we went with father...
- So, that long back!

1235
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,958
It'll be something new for the town.

1236
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,916
We'll show this play to Moga.

1237
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:53,375
We'll get media to cover it.

1238
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:55,125
But...

1239
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:57,625
All the characters
will wear your company's clothes.

1240
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:58,875
Yeah...

1241
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:00,125
I can guarantee...

1242
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:03,000
The play will sell your clothes
better than a fashion show.

1243
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:06,083
What an idea, Mr. Sahil!

1244
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:11,625
It's a rocking idea, Dad. Go for it!

1245
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:13,291
I agree, son.

1246
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:16,833
Ma'am, the entire Moga
will love your performance.

1247
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:22,125
Me, you, Ms. Chatro.
Sweety, we'll perform.

1248
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,291
Sir, you too.

1249
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:25,500
Me?

1250
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:26,666
Come on, Dad...

1251
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,750
Sir, you're the star of the show!

1252
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:31,541
Balbir Chaudhury!

1253
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:33,125
You'll get a standing ovation.

1254
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:34,958
- Trust me.
- No, son...

1255
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,125
No, son.

1256
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:38,791
I don't know how to act.

1257
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,166
Oh come on, I'll teach you.

1258
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,625
I have a degree in acting.

1259
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,958
See... Problem solved!

1260
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:48,416
Chatro.

1261
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:52,708
But who's going to look after the factory?

1262
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:55,833
I have to go to Ambala for meetings.

1263
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:00,666
We have Babloo!

1264
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,375
He can't eat all day!

1265
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:04,625
He's a responsible kid.
He'll take care of Ambala.

1266
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:05,833
He's right, Dad!

1267
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:07,833
I'll sort everything, don't worry.

1268
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:10,791
You just focus on acting.

1269
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,916
I'll do anything for my brother-in-law!

1270
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,934
- You think I'll be able to act?
- Of course, Dad!

1271
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:16,678
- It's going to be amazing.
- So it's fixed.

1272
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:18,625
- We're doing a play!
- Right...

1273
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,416
It'll be the best writing of my life.

1274
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:22,833
Of course, son.

1275
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:25,250
- You know what it's called?
- What?

1276
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:27,916
How I felt when I saw that girl.

1277
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:30,583
Beautiful.

1278
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:32,625
How I felt when I saw that girl.

1279
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:40,125
Will this play change anything?

1280
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,583
I'm not sure.

1281
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:44,083
But we have to start somewhere.

1282
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:46,291
Everyone is sleeping right now.

1283
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,666
Balbir Chaudhury to gift a play to Moga.

1284
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,708
Now touch the pan.

1285
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:20,041
Perfect. Very nice.

1286
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,250
Now relax.

1287
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:31,166
Try to recollect a life experience
and use it while acting.

1288
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:33,125
See...

1289
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:35,625
You're brilliant!

1290
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:39,458
Laughing and crying scenes are easy.

1291
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:44,208
But... I won't know what to do
in a romantic scene.

1292
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:53,708
Hey, come to the makeup room.

1293
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,041
But why?

1294
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,416
Just come.

1295
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:58,791
Sahil.

1296
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:02,125
Sahil?

1297
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:06,500
Sah...

1298
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:09,750
Kuhu!

1299
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:15,750
I told you long-distance
relationships don't work.

1300
01:26:18,916 --> 01:26:21,041
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

1301
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:24,291
How would I get this hug then?

1302
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:31,083
- You've colored your hair, right?
- Yes.

1303
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:32,750
Doesn't look nice?

1304
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:34,916
No. Looks really nice!

1305
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:38,625
Bro, is this a circus?

1306
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,333
Sir...

1307
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:47,166
I'll take care of this.

1308
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:48,416
Thank you.

1309
01:26:48,541 --> 01:26:49,708
Carry on.

1310
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:56,833
Now, listen.

1311
01:26:57,041 --> 01:27:01,458
Till the opening,
you two must keep some distance.

1312
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,458
If anyone finds out that you are...

1313
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,875
Girl... Girlfriend-boyfrie...

1314
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,666
- Girlfriend!
- Girlfriend-girlfriend, sorry.

1315
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,333
If anyone gets a clue

1316
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:14,208
my plan will go down the drain.

1317
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:16,708
But what's your plan?

1318
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,208
Hair color?

1319
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:26,166
- He's here!
- Mr. Sahil's here.

1320
01:27:30,916 --> 01:27:32,166
I feel flattered.

1321
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:38,000
Mr. Balbir, please join me here.

1322
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:40,708
You're the producer.
You're the main guy here.

1323
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:41,791
Please come.

1324
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:45,166
Mr. Balbir Chaudhury, guys!

1325
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,541
Before I forget

1326
01:27:48,708 --> 01:27:50,750
let me introduce a friend
who's come from London

1327
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:51,875
to act in our play.

1328
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:53,333
Kuhu.

1329
01:27:57,333 --> 01:28:00,333
Oh, she was in Delhi
at Amrit's wedding too!

1330
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:01,791
How are you, child?

1331
01:28:02,166 --> 01:28:03,500
I'm good, thank you.

1332
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:04,708
Welcome.

1333
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:07,583
- The world is so small.
- Yes, very small...

1334
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:12,750
So, our story is a fresh love story.

1335
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,708
Two people meet at a wedding
and they fall in love.

1336
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,750
Adulation, sir!

1337
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,666
As often happens,
everyone is against them.

1338
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:26,000
But in the end,
their relationship gets accepted.

1339
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:28,041
Whatever's 'fresh' about that?

1340
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:29,416
Same old cliched story.

1341
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,291
Hear me out, ma'am.

1342
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,833
It's a long, messy story.

1343
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:37,750
So, one of the lovers
will be played by Sweety.

1344
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:44,541
And the second lover
will be played by Kuhu.

1345
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,250
You've lost your mind.
How do I say that in Urdu?

1346
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,666
Just listen to me please.

1347
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:53,166
No, you listen to me!

1348
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:54,958
I'm worried about you.

1349
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:56,958
Is everything alright up there?

1350
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,083
What is this absurd story?

1351
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:00,375
Two girls romancing?

1352
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:03,583
It's a fresh story, sir.
There are plenty guy-girl love stories.

1353
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,750
Why make one more?

1354
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:06,041
Our story is new.

1355
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,041
Lots of people will come to watch it.

1356
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,210
Your company's clothes will get
so much attention.

1357
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,666
Promotion of two bridal dresses
instead of one!

1358
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:14,625
But, son...

1359
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:18,250
Balli, it's a comedy story!

1360
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:19,750
Why are you worried?

1361
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:23,166
People will really enjoy it.
They'll find such a romance hilarious.

1362
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,916
Sure, ma'am.

1363
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:26,583
Sir, I promise you.

1364
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,000
We'll get called to Delhi
and Mumbai to perform!

1365
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:31,138
Your company's clothes will
reach that far!

1366
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:35,541
But why would anyone like such a story?

1367
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:37,375
They'll all criticize it.

1368
01:29:37,541 --> 01:29:39,583
Nobody will criticize it.
Leave that to me.

1369
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,458
I've written a story
that no one will forget.

1370
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Believe me.

1371
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:50,166
I think, it's worth a try.

1372
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:53,750
Right! It's worth a try.

1373
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,833
Even Ms. Chatro agrees.

1374
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:57,958
Absolutely.

1375
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:00,958
Kuhu, Sweety, let's try!

1376
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:04,958
You'll be Sweety's aunt.

1377
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:08,041
You'll play her father.
Real life father-daughter connection.

1378
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:11,500
You'll be Sweety's uncle.
I'll play Kuhu's brother.

1379
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:14,916
Alright then! Let's read our lines once.
And then we'll rehearse on stage.

1380
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:19,625
The news spread like wildfire
across the town.

1381
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:37,708
Well-known businessman Balbir Chaudhury
presents a play called...

1382
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:39,791
How I felt when I saw that girl.

1383
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:45,833
It's a first in Moga.

1384
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:50,083
How I felt when I saw that girl.

1385
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,458
Tell us about the play.

1386
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:53,809
It's a new generation play,
written by the new generation.

1387
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:56,833
Love, that's all it is.
How can loving ever be a crime?

1388
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:58,583
This play is ridiculous!

1389
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:00,125
Those are the climax dialogues.

1390
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:01,416
Come on. Focus!

1391
01:32:20,458 --> 01:32:21,958
Hey, what's wrong?

1392
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:26,375
I wish we'd been normal.

1393
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,333
Our lives wouldn't be so suffocating.

1394
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:32,833
Our families wouldn't have to suffer.

1395
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,958
If you call yourself abnormal

1396
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:42,291
what do you expect from other people?

1397
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:48,750
Kuhu.

1398
01:32:56,958 --> 01:32:59,375
- Greetings.
- That's the consignment from Ambala.

1399
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,708
Take it to the warehouse.

1400
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:02,625
Get going, guys!

1401
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:03,875
Greetings.

1402
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:06,291
Oh right! Tomorrow is the show!

1403
01:33:06,416 --> 01:33:08,500
You should all come, it'll be fun.

1404
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:31,375
So, Sweety-Kuhu, you'll be hugging.

1405
01:33:31,583 --> 01:33:33,625
And, ma'am, you'll say your lines.

1406
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,166
Whisper the lines.

1407
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,791
- Loud whisper. Okay, start.
- Okay.

1408
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:39,791
And you know...

1409
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,500
Sweety, keep hugging...

1410
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,500
- Babloo, listen...
- How dare you!

1411
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:49,458
- Babloo, listen to me.
- What's wrong?

1412
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:53,458
- Dad...
- Have you lost your mind?

1413
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,583
- How dare you hit your brother-in-law?
- Brother-in-law!

1414
01:33:57,833 --> 01:33:59,250
What brother-in-law, Dad?

1415
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:01,875
Don't you see what's going on?

1416
01:34:02,416 --> 01:34:04,250
- Babloo, just come with me...
- You...

1417
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:06,916
Leave him. I said leave him!

1418
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:15,750
Don't you understand
what play he's written?

1419
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:18,291
It's a comedy play, Babloo. Calm down.

1420
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,291
It's no comedy, Grandma.

1421
01:34:21,166 --> 01:34:22,750
It's not even a play.

1422
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,458
It's the truth.

1423
01:34:29,208 --> 01:34:31,958
Dad, do you think
she is having an affair with this guy?

1424
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:34,333
- Babloo, please...
- Shut up!

1425
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:37,250
I'll beat the crap out of you.

1426
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:41,708
Dad, I lied to you...

1427
01:34:42,458 --> 01:34:43,500
To protect her.

1428
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:44,875
To protect all of us.

1429
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:50,708
She's not seeing this moron.

1430
01:34:51,666 --> 01:34:53,208
She's been romancing this girl!

1431
01:34:56,916 --> 01:34:59,541
Dad, can't you see her illness?

1432
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,041
I've known it since she was 14.

1433
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:11,125
I tried my best to make her normal.

1434
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:14,791
But I failed.

1435
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,375
'Normal' for whom, Brother?

1436
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:22,250
You want me to fit into
your idea of 'normal'.

1437
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:25,000
But this is my 'normal'.

1438
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:31,333
Did you see that, Dad?

1439
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:40,708
What is this, Sweety?

1440
01:35:44,375 --> 01:35:46,625
You want to create a scandal in the city?

1441
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:51,416
Humiliate your father? I'm ashamed of you.

1442
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:58,666
This play will not happen.

1443
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:00,958
Cancel the show.

1444
01:36:01,916 --> 01:36:02,958
Babloo,

1445
01:36:05,291 --> 01:36:09,083
rip out all the posters in the city.

1446
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,666
Yes, Dad.

1447
01:36:12,041 --> 01:36:13,041
Come, Mom.

1448
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:15,250
I can't bear to look at her.

1449
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:18,166
There will be a show, Dad.

1450
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:20,500
Rip out as many posters as you like.

1451
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:33,375
What did you say to me?

1452
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:38,125
I would never go against you, Dad,
if this was just about me.

1453
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,875
But it's about all those children

1454
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:43,583
who spend their entire lives in loneliness

1455
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:46,875
craving for just one word of understanding

1456
01:36:47,708 --> 01:36:52,375
whose childhood gets spent
trying to find some way, any way

1457
01:36:52,458 --> 01:36:56,083
to get accepted, to fit in.

1458
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:58,791
Any way to make their
classmates stop laughing.

1459
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:05,916
This play is for the child who lived
her whole life inside her diary.

1460
01:37:06,958 --> 01:37:11,541
Whose father said that
he is ashamed of her.

1461
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,125
But to be honest

1462
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:19,916
her father is letting her down too.

1463
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:21,875
Watch it, Sweety.

1464
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:24,916
You're crossing your limit.

1465
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:26,791
It's time I did that.

1466
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,958
I've been quiet for way too long.

1467
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:32,166
The show will go on, Brother.

1468
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:35,958
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

1469
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:38,166
MY FRIENDS SAY I'M ABNORMAL...

1470
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:42,583
NOBODY TALKS TO ME...

1471
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:40,125
Please have some tea, my child.

1472
01:41:41,416 --> 01:41:42,458
Please do.

1473
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:51,750
I'm telling you, Dad.
We've got to shut down this play.

1474
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:54,000
It'll destroy our reputation.

1475
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:57,291
Just come with me.
I'll set that Mirza straight.

1476
01:42:21,916 --> 01:42:22,958
What's up, Moga?

1477
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:24,333
All good.

1478
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:25,791
I'm Sahil Mirza.

1479
01:42:25,916 --> 01:42:27,833
Writer and director of this play.

1480
01:42:27,958 --> 01:42:29,291
So, if you don't like the play

1481
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:32,583
you know where to direct
the rotten eggs and tomatoes.

1482
01:42:33,541 --> 01:42:34,958
I have a request.

1483
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:39,416
Please don't just watch our play.
Feel it in your heart.

1484
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:44,291
Presenting,
How I felt when I saw that girl.

1485
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:01,166
Come on.

1486
01:43:02,125 --> 01:43:03,916
Greetings.

1487
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,375
- Who's this handsome?
- He is my son.

1488
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:08,875
- Is he single?
- Yes.

1489
01:43:08,958 --> 01:43:12,833
Meet my niece! Our girl is very sweet,
perfect homemaker.

1490
01:43:13,416 --> 01:43:14,416
Hello.

1491
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:32,458
So, guys, let me tell you.
Something about myself.

1492
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:34,958
I'm not your typical romantic kind of guy.

1493
01:43:35,333 --> 01:43:39,625
But when I saw this girl,
I knew I can't live without her.

1494
01:43:41,666 --> 01:43:43,125
So I'm thinking of proposing to her.

1495
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:44,928
- Go ahead!
- I think I'll just do it today?

1496
01:43:44,958 --> 01:43:47,750
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck, bro!

1497
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,708
Go for it!

1498
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:58,833
Brother, the straight line is over here!
You don't stand a chance.

1499
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:00,916
What does she mean by straight line?

1500
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Nothing.

1501
01:44:02,208 --> 01:44:03,791
You know, my sister is nuts.

1502
01:44:04,541 --> 01:44:06,125
Her sense of humor is weird.

1503
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:07,625
I'll just...

1504
01:44:10,458 --> 01:44:12,375
It's been only a day since we met

1505
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:17,250
but it feels like we've
known each other for ages.

1506
01:44:17,708 --> 01:44:20,833
Don't know whether
it's a dream or reality.

1507
01:44:21,375 --> 01:44:22,666
What the hell is going on?

1508
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:24,041
This is outrageous!

1509
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:25,250
Unbelievable!

1510
01:44:25,416 --> 01:44:26,708
Get up. We're leaving.

1511
01:44:27,041 --> 01:44:29,791
Why are we watching this nonsense?
Let's go.

1512
01:44:30,375 --> 01:44:31,916
Come on.

1513
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:33,791
Let's get the hell out of here.

1514
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:37,458
Continue. Continue.

1515
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,500
Go...

1516
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:47,833
Oh dear God. What's going on here?

1517
01:44:53,125 --> 01:44:55,791
I had accepted my fate

1518
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,416
but you changed my fate.

1519
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:06,041
We have a long battle ahead.

1520
01:45:06,625 --> 01:45:09,875
But if you're with me,
I will fight till the end.

1521
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:15,416
What a waste of time!

1522
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,583
It is well known that gossip
spreads like wildfire.

1523
01:45:21,458 --> 01:45:26,833
By morning, the whole city knew.

1524
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:30,833
- Listen, don't tell anyone.
- These people have no shame.

1525
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:33,166
- It was a mistake to come here.
- Let's go, hurry up.

1526
01:45:35,791 --> 01:45:39,833
Dad, this is not the time to hide.

1527
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:43,375
That rascal will shame the Chaudhury name.

1528
01:45:44,208 --> 01:45:47,375
And then we'll have to hide all our lives.

1529
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:49,666
We must go, Dad!

1530
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:51,791
I...

1531
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Good God!

1532
01:46:00,125 --> 01:46:01,458
Get my scooter out!

1533
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:25,083
Aunty. Aunty, please let me go.

1534
01:46:25,291 --> 01:46:27,416
- I swear I'll go somewhere far away.
- Be quiet!

1535
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,208
Don't you dare set foot out of here.

1536
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:31,375
You've disgraced us enough at the wedding.

1537
01:46:31,541 --> 01:46:33,750
Just wait for your dad.
He'll set you straight.

1538
01:46:33,916 --> 01:46:36,500
What will the society say?

1539
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:38,791
No one is above the society.

1540
01:46:38,916 --> 01:46:42,125
- She has brought dishonor to us.
- Have I called you to guard the place?

1541
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:45,041
This has been my life
ever since I was little.

1542
01:46:45,166 --> 01:46:47,375
- What is this, Mr. Chaudhury?
- Let's go.

1543
01:46:47,583 --> 01:46:53,833
Repressed, suffocated,
trapped inside my own self.

1544
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:56,166
I'm going to...

1545
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:05,083
Let me out! Let me out!

1546
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:08,666
Let me out! Let me out!

1547
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:13,208
Daddy, let me out! Let me out, Daddy!

1548
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:16,000
Please free me, Daddy.

1549
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:17,500
Please, Daddy.

1550
01:47:18,416 --> 01:47:20,541
Daddy, please help me! I beg of you.

1551
01:47:22,916 --> 01:47:28,958
Daddy, please set me free!

1552
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:31,458
Daddy, please. Daddy! Please!

1553
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
And Brother Babloo's favorite is me.

1554
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:54,833
Even brother is like the others,
please change him.

1555
01:47:54,916 --> 01:47:57,416
We shall be together forever.

1556
01:47:59,833 --> 01:48:02,750
Someday... I'll fall in love.

1557
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:04,291
I'll be a bride.

1558
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:09,791
I'll always be alone.

1559
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:13,208
God, please reform me.

1560
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:17,208
Her father is letting her down too.

1561
01:48:29,583 --> 01:48:32,458
Daddy, please help me, let me out.

1562
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:39,916
Disgusting girls!

1563
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:44,375
No matter where you two go

1564
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:47,875
there's no place for you in our society.

1565
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:51,833
They've challenged Indian tradition.
They're corrupted by the west.

1566
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:55,375
Is there even one person
willing to support you?

1567
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:58,291
Anyone?

1568
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:02,958
There's only one way to reform them.

1569
01:49:03,583 --> 01:49:05,666
Get them married to boys.

1570
01:49:05,916 --> 01:49:08,083
And force them to do
everything that normal people do.

1571
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:09,958
Tie them up if we have to.

1572
01:49:10,541 --> 01:49:14,333
No! There's only one fix for them!

1573
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:17,416
- These girls are the filth of society.
- Yes!

1574
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:18,750
Slash their heads!

1575
01:49:21,166 --> 01:49:22,458
You are filth!

1576
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:23,541
Balli!

1577
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:27,000
- Please, sir...
- All of you are filth!

1578
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:29,875
How dare you hurt my child?

1579
01:49:29,958 --> 01:49:33,041
How dare you lay a finger on her?
I'll smash your fingers!

1580
01:49:33,416 --> 01:49:34,416
Please stop, sir.

1581
01:49:39,416 --> 01:49:42,500
It's a play. I was acting.

1582
01:49:43,666 --> 01:49:49,250
Sahil, if you were told to marry a man,

1583
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,375
would you do it?

1584
01:49:53,291 --> 01:49:54,333
Never.

1585
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,666
Because nature has made you like that.

1586
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,250
It's the same with them.

1587
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:05,750
Nature made them this way.

1588
01:50:07,416 --> 01:50:10,291
It's not about western influence.

1589
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:15,875
Slapping them, locking them up
won't change the way they love.

1590
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:25,583
It's not an illness that needs a cure.

1591
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:27,708
It's love. That's all it is.

1592
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:33,541
Having love is a blessing from God.

1593
01:50:36,416 --> 01:50:39,500
How can loving ever be a crime?

1594
01:50:42,166 --> 01:50:43,416
Sweety...

1595
01:50:45,291 --> 01:50:48,208
I'd lay down my life for your happiness.

1596
01:50:50,333 --> 01:50:53,541
You don't need to run away to London.

1597
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:57,458
You will live your life
the way you want to.

1598
01:51:04,291 --> 01:51:05,291
Mr. Balbir...

1599
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:23,958
My Bullet Train.

1600
01:51:25,833 --> 01:51:29,500
I thought you took after your mother

1601
01:51:31,541 --> 01:51:33,333
but you're just like me.

1602
01:51:35,166 --> 01:51:36,833
You see, I like women too.

1603
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:26,583
So mister, still wasting your time?

1604
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:28,250
Anything urgent, Dad?

1605
01:52:28,791 --> 01:52:30,541
I just saw this news online

1606
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:33,833
about some hit play in Moga.

1607
01:52:34,333 --> 01:52:37,750
Some fresh, fantastic story.

1608
01:52:38,208 --> 01:52:40,708
Could you get me in touch with the writer?

1609
01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:44,125
I hope he can write my next movie.

1610
01:52:49,125 --> 01:52:51,500
My son is the best writer ever!

1611
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:54,625
- I'm coming home, Mom.
- Come soon, baby.

1612
01:52:58,916 --> 01:53:00,833
Hey, what about me? Your Dad?

1613
01:53:06,333 --> 01:53:07,333
Sahil!

1614
01:53:07,916 --> 01:53:08,916
Sweety.

1615
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:11,500
How can you leave without telling me?

1616
01:53:12,458 --> 01:53:14,291
Sorry, I hate goodbyes.

1617
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:16,000
Then, don't say goodbye.

1618
01:53:16,125 --> 01:53:17,500
Say, see you later.

1619
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,083
Coach S-3.

1620
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,083
So, what do you say?

1621
01:53:28,625 --> 01:53:30,791
You think that playwright
has ever been in love?

1622
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,541
Well, he sure got some
complication in his life.

1623
01:53:34,166 --> 01:53:37,750
No, but is it the real, true love?
Or still no magic?

1624
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,375
He has so much magic

1625
01:53:40,458 --> 01:53:43,291
that whoever finds it
will be in for a big reward.

1626
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:45,458
A jackpot!

1627
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:54,125
You must take your play
to small towns and villages.

1628
01:53:55,333 --> 01:53:58,250
There will be many Sweetys there.
You could help them too.

1629
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:11,625
Yes.

1630
01:54:16,166 --> 01:54:17,666
- See you later.
- See you later.

1631
01:54:28,666 --> 01:54:31,208
- Did you roll the tomato?
- Yes.

1632
01:54:31,708 --> 01:54:33,583
- Properly?
- Yes, ma'am.

1633
01:54:33,708 --> 01:54:35,375
I'll find out soon enough.

1634
01:54:35,916 --> 01:54:37,333
THL.

1635
01:54:39,375 --> 01:54:40,375
THL?

1636
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:43,375
Tadka Heeng Lasun.

1637
01:54:43,666 --> 01:54:45,500
How's this name for a restaurant?

1638
01:54:46,916 --> 01:54:48,625
Tadka Heeng Lasun?

1639
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:50,375
It's mind-shattering.

1640
01:54:50,625 --> 01:54:52,541
Full of aroma.

1641
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:53,750
Thank you.

1642
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,416
On that note...

1643
01:54:58,083 --> 01:54:59,291
It's worth a try.

1644
01:55:01,958 --> 01:55:04,500
It's worth a try.

1645
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:07,791
Back at you.

1646
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:18,416
Ms. Chatro, shall we do a partnership?

1647
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:22,208
Partnership?

1648
01:55:24,125 --> 01:55:25,833
What kind of partnership?

1649
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:30,250
Professional? Or Personal?

1650
01:55:40,541 --> 01:55:43,250
'Mr.' or 'Ms.' is irrelevant.

1651
01:55:43,375 --> 01:55:44,416
X means X.

1652
01:55:44,541 --> 01:55:46,500
Do I look like a big...

1653
01:55:46,583 --> 01:55:50,166
Yes, you do! Sore loser!

1654
01:55:50,708 --> 01:55:53,083
Come here, my little baby.

1655
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:59,166
- Ma'am, bless me.
- I haven't changed so much as yet.

1656
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:00,250
Grandma!

1657
01:56:00,708 --> 01:56:02,541
Come, son. Come.

1658
01:56:03,375 --> 01:56:05,625
Give all your attention
to the factory now.

1659
01:56:05,875 --> 01:56:08,833
I'll get busy with my new restaurant.

1660
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:11,291
You will run a restaurant, Daddy. But...

1661
01:56:11,375 --> 01:56:14,500
She has embarrassed me in the community.

1662
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:20,208
Pleasing society is bigger
than your sister's happiness, right?

1663
01:56:20,416 --> 01:56:22,208
Dad, I don't understand all this.

1664
01:56:22,333 --> 01:56:23,708
It's alright, Brother.

1665
01:56:24,125 --> 01:56:26,125
Someday, you will, if you just try.

1666
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:51,416
