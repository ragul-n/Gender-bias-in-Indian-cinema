1
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:15,351
Our brains are remarkable
and miracles.

2
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:17,617
Even what they can do everything

3
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:19,825
all is we give them high technology.

4
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:23,542
Hipo Compass is the
gateway of memories.

5
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:30,088
Short term memories are stored
in the proformed cortex.

6
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:34,191
But eventually they have to be
transferred to the long term memory.

7
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:37,072
And that's where
the hippocampus comes in.

8
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:49,474
From one snail to another snail

9
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,718
through injection of RMA

10
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:54,586
scientists had transferred memory.

11
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,630
Not just restoring memories,
even on other matters

12
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,116
through cellular messenger, RMA

13
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,419
plays an important role.

14
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:14,592
Memories are stored in
the nucleus of neurons.

15
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:17,037
Through RMA

16
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:19,421
Scientists believe
that these memories

17
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:21,501
can be restored.

18
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,889
At present,
in many labs in the world

19
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:29,376
research is continued on
the memrory transfer.

20
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:37,702
Now we welcome
the young Nero scientist, Sarah.

21
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:43,698
WBE, Whole Brain Emolution.

22
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:47,297
This is also called mind upload,
brain upload or mind copying.

23
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:50,434
There are 86 billion nerve cells
in human brain.

24
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,600
Every neuron connects
with another neuron

25
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,488
through dendrites and axons.

26
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,229
This is a cute rat.

27
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:07,851
If you are able to take the mice
and access electrical signals

28
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,490
processing through it's Hipo Compass

29
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,829
and record them and shock these
memories back into it's Hipo Compass

30
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,591
the mouse remembers the task.

31
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,905
Let me show you my cute rat. Rat.

32
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,065
Come here, come here...

33
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:27,787
Guys, please help
me find her. Oh, no.

34
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,171
Check there. Check under the chair.

35
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:32,246
Where is it?
- May be there.

36
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,295
Where is it?

37
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,753
Hey!
- Where?

38
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,566
Hello. Yes, Arun, tell me.

39
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:39,676
Why are you tensed?

40
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:41,838
My rat went missing, Arun.
- What?

41
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:45,288
The rat, on which I am
trying memory transfer.

42
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,120
I don't understand how to catch him.

43
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,541
Sarah, what if you feel tensed
for just a rat?

44
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,377
A top criminal escaped from jail.

45
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,386
The whole department
is tensed about it.

46
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,479
Who's that guy?

47
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,776
The guy who's accused in
Kasi Viswanadh's murder.

48
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:00,179
What's his name?
- Shankar.

49
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:04,632
Sir, that Shankar broke my teeth

50
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,935
and got into the Bollaram factory,
sir.

51
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,887
I need backup, sir.

52
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,600
Do you spoil our
department's dignity?

53
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,854
He is like a crow bar.

54
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:35,604
Uncle...

55
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:39,760
Police uncle...

56
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:42,550
Hey, I will shoot you down.

57
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:54,058
Shankar.

58
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:56,400
If you fight with me

59
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,484
it's like tying a Ram
in front of Pochamma temple.

60
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:12,646
I escaped from the jail, not
for eating Paradise biryani.

61
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,480
It's for cutting the hunt.

62
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:20,656
Hey!

63
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:23,799
I have been roaming since
an year with disturbed mind.

64
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,831
Don't try to irritate me.

65
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:40,373
Shankar, you can't escape.

66
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:41,862
Surrender yourself.

67
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,305
Listen why I am asking you.

68
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:45,225
Uncle!

69
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,429
Don't advise me.
- Kill him.

70
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:52,909
I know what to do and how to do.

71
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:55,980
Everyone here is talented.

72
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:02,260
Hey!

73
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:06,991
Hey! Hey!

74
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,805
Hey!

75
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:18,449
Uncle! Don't just shout.

76
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,842
You also have families

77
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:26,882
go home silently and
sleep with your wife.

78
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:30,236
Don't try to sleep with me

79
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:34,500
you will not have sleep and
the sun will not rise outside.

80
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:52,350
Catch him.

81
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:58,956
Hey you, stop.

82
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:23,018
Arrest him in the hand-cuffs.

83
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:33,715
I beat you very less
by giving respect to the uniform.

84
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,628
I will not, anymore.

85
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:38,891
Hey!
- No uniform, no respect you...

86
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:02,203
[religious chants continue]

87
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:27,147
Deva, Shankar escaped from the jail.

88
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,108
When?
- It's been an hour.

89
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:34,586
Call DGP.

90
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,839
Hello, sir.
- Mr. Devandra is on the line.

91
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,842
Talk to him. DGP.

92
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:46,002
DGP.
- Greetings, sir.

93
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:47,813
It's been one year

94
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,722
that my father expired.

95
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,359
I am doing ceremony here
for his soul to rest in peace.

96
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,305
If I get to know, at this time,
that my father's killer escaped

97
00:09:57,385 --> 00:09:58,767
how do you think we'll feel?

98
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,140
How did he escape from central jail?

99
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,711
Did anyone co-operate?

100
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:04,770
Or else is it your inability?

101
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,421
Catch that Shankar urgently
and keep him back in jail.

102
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,759
Deva.

103
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:10,943
Not in jail

104
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:13,767
ask them to shoot and kill him.
- Sister!

105
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:15,821
Cool down.

106
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,162
Son, where are you coming from?

107
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:28,578
Cherlapalli.

108
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:30,334
Where are you going?

109
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,915
To Lashkar.

110
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:37,164
Are you going on work or for girl?

111
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,232
Why do you look so sad?

112
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,801
Why do you look worried?

113
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:45,814
Tell me about your story.

114
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:50,546
I think there is a girl
in your story.

115
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,546
Tell me her name at least.

116
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,994
Chandini.
- Chandini?

117
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,059
Where did you meet her?

118
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:02,895
Tell me, where did you meet her.

119
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:07,866
'Go straight and hit.
I will see who comes.'

120
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:10,532
'What? That's it. Go, go. Hit.'

121
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,707
What do you think of Shankar?
- You idiot.

122
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:16,929
Can't you see? We are working here.

123
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,607
Don't you have common sense?
Are you mad or what?

124
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:23,667
What is it, brother?

125
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:26,540
English is flowing.
In which school are you born?

126
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,353
First, you speak properly. Okay?

127
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,807
And, behave yourself.

128
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,389
Where is your owner?
- Why?

129
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:34,824
Why? Why do you want my owner?
Talk to me.

130
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,888
I came here to give
your owner something.

131
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:37,999
Then give it to me.

132
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:39,620
Give it.

133
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:43,658
I have dozen more. Shall I give?

134
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:46,209
Sir, my owner is in sixth floor.

135
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,819
When there's clash in language

136
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,238
slap him.
- Yes.

137
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:53,761
If communication is spoiled

138
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,363
pull the ear.
- Yes, brother.

139
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:56,701
They will become normal.

140
00:11:57,771 --> 00:11:59,274
There is the lift, man.

141
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:05,642
Complete all this work.
- Okay, sir.

142
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:06,882
Is it okay?
- Okay.

143
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,535
Why did you come here, Shankar?

144
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:12,637
I came to get my daughter
married to you. Will you do?

145
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:16,281
Why are you not answering my call?
- Shankar, actually...

146
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,468
When you had problem with the site,
didn't I and uncle help you?

147
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:21,531
You did it.

148
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:24,527
Didn't you construct
building happily?

149
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:26,195
I did it.
- Then?

150
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,819
Are you trying to cheat the one
who gave you food?

151
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:30,430
What do you want now?

152
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,826
I want this flat.

153
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:37,242
Shankar, this is 3000sqft.

154
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:44,054
Close that piece
and make it balcony.

155
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:48,331
I don't want this wall. Remove it.

156
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,692
Sir, that is pillar.
The building will collapse.

157
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:52,850
Remove it.

158
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,527
Do you know how much this costs?

159
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:02,641
If I keep a projector here,
the image should fall there.

160
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,851
I will give you the balance amount,
Shankar.

161
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:08,313
Hey, what is this? Kitchen?

162
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:10,343
I don't want a kitchen.

163
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,832
Shankar and cooking?

164
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,002
Shankar,
I'll pay you 1 million extra.

165
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,685
I need a tub
in the centre of the hall.

166
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:25,892
I have to sit in it,
have two pegs with legs spread

167
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,907
and watch movie.

168
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,297
What movie shall we watch?

169
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,237
What is that recent movie released?
Tom Cruise's?

170
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,515
Shankar, you are asking too much.

171
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:38,166
Are you playing dramas? You idiot.

172
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:57,817
Who are you, man?

173
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,590
You don't have quarter kilo of meat
on your chest.

174
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,441
Are you a goon?

175
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:05,624
Do you know,
what kind of Pehelwans I saw?

176
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:09,400
Do you beat my owner?
Are you such hero? Hey!

177
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,820
I am bigger goon than you.

178
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,585
First, fight with me.

179
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,293
I shook the boys
in Warangal college.

180
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:21,492
Ask at Siddipet centre.
They will tell you about Chandini.

181
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:22,969
If I snap my fingers

182
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:25,635
everyone from Tarnaka to Chaturnaka
will stand.

183
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,063
That's why I don't snap my fingers.

184
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:31,500
Amberpet Yadav,
Shadnagar Satti, Gouliguda Ganesh

185
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,132
call me sister
and tie rakhi from me.

186
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:35,573
Did you understand?

187
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:38,799
Why are you staring like that? Hey!

188
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,592
Oh, God!

189
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:52,327
Do you know who I am?

190
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:58,065
Shankar! Ustaad iSmart Shankar.

191
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,571
Hey, doll!

192
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:20,122
If you say yes

193
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:22,708
I'll repair Golconda fort
and keep it in your hands.

194
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,655
I will make you queen
and let you sit in the palace.

195
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,852
What do you say?

196
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:36,980
Get lost, idiot.

197
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,918
I have seen
a lot of guys like you.

198
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:56,542
What is he doing?

199
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:04,327
What happened, brother?
Why are you like that?

200
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,614
That girl is troubling me, man.

201
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:07,755
Who, brother?

202
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:09,163
Chandini.

203
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,906
She is not allowing me
to sleep at nights.

204
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:14,338
I am drinking two extra pegs
because of her.

205
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:18,063
I saw her the other night
getting wet in the rain.

206
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,117
Do you know how much I enjoyed?

207
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:22,074
Wow! Oh, God.

208
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:24,865
Her waist, her figure

209
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,108
she was like a Turkey hen.

210
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:29,347
You idiot.

211
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:31,285
Turkey hen? How does that look like?

212
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:35,129
Hey, the same that has more in front
and back and thin in the middle.

213
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,228
Oh!

214
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,050
I have to eat it's thigh piece.
- Whose, brother?

215
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,737
The Turkey hen's.

216
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:45,301
Her naval is...

217
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:48,577
Is it Turkey hen's?
- Idiot. Chandini's, man.

218
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,078
What an eyes she has.

219
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,164
When she looks with anger...

220
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,349
Wow! Wow! Wow!

221
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,068
She is more cute when she scolds,
than when she smiles.

222
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:02,143
I fell for her scoldings.

223
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:04,204
Brother, please stop the vehicle.

224
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:13,314
"Any girl I see,
my mind goes blank."

225
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:16,685
"I don't get sleep in spite
of drinking alcohol."

226
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:20,130
"I am not a mad fellow
to leave and go."

227
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,463
"I will elope her,
leaving everything behind."

228
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:25,843
What, brother?

229
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:26,900
Nothing, brother.
- Let's go.

230
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,979
Why did you stop?
You start it, brother.

231
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:33,159
What are you planning to do,
brother?

232
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,753
Nothing, man.

233
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,908
I will take a flat
from that builder.

234
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:39,075
I will keep her there.

235
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:42,747
After marriage

236
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,422
I have to beat her at least once.

237
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,745
Beating wife is wrong, brother.

238
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:49,692
You keep quiet, man.
Nothing will happen.

239
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:54,159
When she sees angrily,
her face is...

240
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,578
Wow! Wow! Wow!

241
00:20:56,658 --> 00:20:58,612
Do you know how cute it looks?

242
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,060
I am following her daily.
- Okay.

243
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,399
I am trying to talk to her.
- Yes.

244
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,863
She is not falling for me.

245
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:07,905
Brother, why do you try for her?

246
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:09,648
Throw money and see the fun.

247
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,440
Everything...
- Hey!

248
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,895
Stop it. Stop the vehicle.
- Sister, are you here?

249
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:16,297
Stop it.
Stop the vehicle, you idiot.

250
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:18,376
I am stopping, sister.

251
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,094
Sister... Sorry sister.
- Do you have mind?

252
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:22,129
Will you throw money?

253
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,266
He is cheap.
- Forgive me.

254
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,010
But you are cheaper, idiot.
- Sister...

255
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,063
Leave me, sister.

256
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:28,242
What is it?
Why are you staring like that?

257
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:31,299
I got you in the night.

258
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:34,286
I will take you away.
- Will you really take me away?

259
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:35,439
Yes.

260
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,159
Yes?
- Hey!

261
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,893
Take the vehicle.
- I am taking it, brother.

262
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,091
Let's go. Hey!

263
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,103
Stop it.

264
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:49,484
Hey! Hey, stop.

265
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,128
Hey.
- I will stab you. I will do it.

266
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,311
I will stab you.

267
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:55,291
You...

268
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:58,120
Hey, if I break your box,
you'll set straight.

269
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:00,380
Why...
- What box, mam?

270
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,722
Oh, this one?

271
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:06,270
Where are you running?

272
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,758
Hey, my owner! House owner is there.

273
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:10,590
I got you.

274
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,795
I am telling you. No.

275
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,139
You are done today. Come.

276
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,334
Hey, it seems,
rape is happening inside?

277
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:21,360
No rape, brother.

278
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,319
They're having lot of fun inside,
brother.

279
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:23,704
Fun? Let's go and see.
- Sir...

280
00:22:23,784 --> 00:22:25,763
Please, stop, sir.
- Move away. Let's watch fun.

281
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,129
Sir...
- Let's see.

282
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,665
Why did you stop, man?
Are you tired?

283
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,437
Not tired.

284
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,215
I never saw you so closely.

285
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,807
How cute are you? Angrily?

286
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:45,095
Look angrily! Come on, look angrily!

287
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,814
Beat again. Beat me hard.

288
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:50,365
If you ask me like that,
I am unable to beat you.

289
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,466
Who is it?
- Police.

290
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:56,114
Sir, I liked him. You leave now.

291
00:22:56,194 --> 00:22:57,197
What?

292
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:00,322
You are an interruption.

293
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:02,173
I have lot of work. Leave, sir.

294
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:03,918
I told you right?
It's great fun, sir.

295
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:05,804
Come, sir. Let's go.

296
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:07,597
Now tell me.

297
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:09,510
Where are you from?

298
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:15,278
What is it, man?

299
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,297
Once you got the girl,
you even forgot your uncle?

300
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:20,026
You are not coming home as well.
Idiot!

301
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:21,712
Stop it, uncle.
The hair style will spoil.

302
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:22,764
Is it?

303
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:24,257
I need to talk to you. Go.

304
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:29,874
What is this?

305
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:32,391
Check it.

306
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,974
So much money? Oh, God.

307
00:23:38,054 --> 00:23:40,333
I never thought I will see
so much money, uncle.

308
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:42,193
The whole amount is yours.

309
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,104
Don't joke, uncle.

310
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:45,904
You must be kidding.

311
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:47,802
This is just advance.

312
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,066
Once you finish work,
you'll get more.

313
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,225
Do I have to kill someone, uncle?

314
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,707
A very big celebrity.

315
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:00,287
We can't kill normally.

316
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:04,106
But he has a second setup.

317
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,482
Every Wednesday, he goes there.

318
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,232
Security is also less there.

319
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:12,703
Can kill very easily.

320
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:14,260
Life will settle.

321
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,634
If life settles,
then we can kill, uncle.

322
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,423
Kill him and stop worries.

323
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:23,783
What's his name, uncle?

324
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,294
Why do you need the name, man?

325
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:28,040
You will see him while killing.

326
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:34,522
Hey, is everyone ready
at the meeting?

327
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:37,765
Though we have a very good name,
the work will not happen.

328
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:40,988
If we have to come to power

329
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:44,271
we have to throw money
at the people.

330
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:56,039
Take our people there
and create chaos.

331
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:58,291
Their meeting should not happen.

332
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:19,662
Who are you?

333
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,166
Did Peddireddy send you?

334
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,856
Do you show gun
at this Kasi Viswanadh?

335
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,183
Are you that dare enough?

336
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:32,414
Do you have the guts to shoot?

337
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:41,269
Sir!

338
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:46,315
Sir...

339
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:49,588
Sir!
- Sir!

340
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:50,540
Sir!
- Oh, no...

341
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,896
Sir!

342
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:55,721
Dear!

343
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:57,153
Kumar Shankar.
- Sir!

344
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,481
Sir.
- Oh, no.

345
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,105
Hey, catch him.
- What happened?

346
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,940
Who was it?

347
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,711
Catch him.
- Get up.

348
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,186
Sir!
- Catch him.

349
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,573
Sir!

350
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:14,857
Uncle.
- What is it?

351
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:17,436
When I shot him, he smiled, uncle.

352
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:20,089
I became a fan of him.

353
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:23,159
He is a real man.
- Nobody saw you there, right?

354
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,655
No.

355
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:26,804
You take your girl
and go underground.

356
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:28,762
I will collect the remaining amount.

357
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:34,674
"Come, come. I am your love."

358
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:38,945
"Oh God! I am your rejection."

359
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:41,637
What is it, man?
- Come out. Will go. Fast.

360
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,883
Where?
- To honeymoon.

361
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:47,648
What honeymoon,
even before marriage?

362
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:50,413
These days

363
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:52,316
first honeymoon is going on.
- Is it?

364
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:54,737
Then, marriage might
happen or may not.

365
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,583
The generation is like that.

366
00:26:57,069 --> 00:26:59,373
What can we do? We just follow.

367
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:02,258
Hey!
- Come. Let's go to the Baga beach.

368
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:03,808
What will you do at the Baga beach?

369
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,032
I will make you mad.

370
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,523
You will not come back.

371
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:09,098
Is it?
- Yes.

372
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,457
Chandini.
- Yes.

373
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:14,630
I used to look into your eyes daily.

374
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:18,290
There was something.
I didn't know what.

375
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,770
I saw it deeply today.

376
00:30:22,374 --> 00:30:24,030
I saw my house

377
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:26,286
in your eyes.

378
00:30:26,802 --> 00:30:28,827
I saw 2-3 kids too.

379
00:30:36,192 --> 00:30:37,557
Sir.
- Yes, Dharam.

380
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:39,475
I got the address of Shankar.

381
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:41,714
Where is he?
- In Goa.

382
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:04,228
Hey, give me a beer.
- Okay, sir.

383
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,102
Shankar!

384
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:34,915
Hey!

385
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:09,205
You go that side.

386
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:47,796
Come.

387
00:32:58,092 --> 00:32:59,613
Hey! Hey, wait.

388
00:33:02,142 --> 00:33:03,174
Hey!
- Hey!

389
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,217
Hey!

390
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:11,313
Stop.

391
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:13,394
Hey,give me the magazine.
- Here, Sir.

392
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:22,058
Come.

393
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:30,825
Guns down. Guns down.

394
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:33,045
Chandini.
- This is Goa police.

395
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,073
Hold him.
- Chandini.

396
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:36,192
Come on.

397
00:33:36,272 --> 00:33:37,577
Sir, this is DCP.
- Chandini.

398
00:33:37,657 --> 00:33:39,251
Show us your passport.

399
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:40,545
Chandini.
- Passport.

400
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,849
I'll tell you, sir.
- Chandini.

401
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,817
Chandini.

402
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:47,479
He has kllled ex-minister's.

403
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,231
He fled and came here.

404
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,943
Please get up.

405
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:54,190
Chandini.

406
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,643
What happened, sir?
- What happened, sir?

407
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:57,284
Don't worry, sir. We will take it.

408
00:33:57,364 --> 00:33:58,740
Who are you, man?

409
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,622
What did my girl do?

410
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:04,921
Chandini! Chandini!

411
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:08,362
Chandini, look here. Chandini!

412
00:34:09,987 --> 00:34:11,591
Chandini!

413
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,733
Chandini...

414
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:30,756
[indistinct chatter]

415
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,432
What son, why are you crying?

416
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,914
Don't cry.

417
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:44,986
Gachibowli has come. Get down now.

418
00:34:57,948 --> 00:34:59,081
Uncle.

419
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:06,847
Hey, why did you come here?
What if police sees you?

420
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,494
Police will not do anything, uncle.

421
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:12,009
If anyone has to do anything,
that will be those I believed.

422
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:14,951
Son, you were caught in the jail.

423
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,446
Your girl is gone.

424
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:17,987
I felt very sad, son.

425
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,163
If you were so sad

426
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,169
you didn't even come once
in the whole year.

427
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:22,610
Oh, no. Not that, son.

428
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,201
I was busy with work.

429
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:27,301
When you said, life will settle,
I thought you mentioned ours.

430
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:31,002
But now I understood
that it's only yours.

431
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:34,755
Uncle...

432
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,837
From childhood, I grew with you.

433
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,786
Whatever you told me,
I did it blindly.

434
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,022
Uncle said and I should do it.

435
00:35:44,652 --> 00:35:46,176
Is it true or not?
- Not that, Shankar.

436
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:48,068
My girl is gone in the middle.

437
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,905
I didn't say anything to the police.

438
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,243
Did I ask you?

439
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:53,864
Then why are you saying it?

440
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:57,578
I will not even ask you
for how much you sold me.

441
00:35:58,279 --> 00:35:59,956
I will ask you only one thing.

442
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:05,054
Who is behind you?
- Even I don't know, Shankar.

443
00:36:05,134 --> 00:36:07,359
There are two or three of them.
Even they contacted me on phone.

444
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,494
Did you get the money
that you gave me

445
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:09,633
also through phone?

446
00:36:09,713 --> 00:36:11,071
Hey, don't you understand
what I'm saying?

447
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:12,978
There are big shots behind this.

448
00:36:13,058 --> 00:36:14,661
If you try to touch them now

449
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:16,352
they will kill both you and me.

450
00:36:16,432 --> 00:36:18,810
If I'm gone, then it's fine.
What if you are gone?

451
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:54,652
Oh, God.

452
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,114
Hey, who are you?

453
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,702
Drive, dear. Go forward.
- Who the hell are you, man?

454
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:07,618
No! No, Shankar.

455
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:09,892
Uncle, we are in public.

456
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:11,896
I don't have time at all.
Tell me his name.

457
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:13,266
I will not tell.

458
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,669
Hey, silent.
Search what's in his pocket.

459
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:31,731
Hello Sarah, tell me.

460
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:33,859
Arun! Where are you, Arun?

461
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,032
What happened?

462
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:37,811
Someone is shot dead in my car.

463
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:40,119
What?
- Please! Please come fast.

464
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:42,483
Okay, I'm sending the cops.
Be there.

465
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,918
'In a car accident today
at Hi-tech city'

466
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:30,359
'the guy who died very suspiciously'

467
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:33,336
'the police recognised him
as 'Hawala Prakash'.'

468
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:45,566
Take it.

469
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:50,439
He was the one,
whom Shankar shot, sir.

470
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,555
What's his name?
- He is called as Kaka.

471
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:54,742
What is the relation
between him and Shankar?

472
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:56,766
He is the one who appointed Shankar.

473
00:38:57,388 --> 00:38:58,890
You said,
someone named Prakash died?

474
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,603
That is being handled by the CBI,
sir.

475
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:02,762
Does he and that guy has any link?

476
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,398
I don't know, sir.
- Try to know.

477
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,971
Let's find out.
- Sure, sir.

478
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:14,760
Hey, Sarah. Listen to this.

479
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,661
Pinky, why are you crying?

480
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,040
If I think about that Shankar,
I am really frightened.

481
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:39,882
He killed a man in front of me,
Arun.

482
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,376
It's his profession.

483
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:44,587
And, he is in the frustration
that his girlfriend is dead.

484
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,720
Shankar is a criminal.

485
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,754
But there are many
who are more dangerous than him.

486
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:51,920
I need to pull them all out.

487
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:54,387
You are dealing with such persons.

488
00:39:54,968 --> 00:39:57,143
I don't have anyone other than you,
Arun.

489
00:39:58,347 --> 00:40:00,726
If something happens to you,
I can't bear it.

490
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:04,965
Pinky!

491
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:08,340
Even I don't know what happens when.

492
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:10,398
But this is my job.

493
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:14,474
My investigation is almost complete.

494
00:40:14,554 --> 00:40:15,795
After that I will take leave.

495
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:19,096
Two months break. We will go abroad.

496
00:40:23,895 --> 00:40:26,734
Feb 14th is our marriage.

497
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,737
'In the murder case of ex-chief
minister, Kasi Viswanadh'

498
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,846
'Shankar escaped from jail.'

499
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:43,297
'The police is searching for him.'

500
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:44,604
'In this case'

501
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:47,576
'CBI investigation has not come
to an end yet.'

502
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,526
'Who is the main culprits'

503
00:40:49,606 --> 00:40:51,472
'is still a mystery.'

504
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,313
Deva.

505
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,382
Not just that Shankar

506
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,345
that Peddireddy, his brothers,
everyone should be in the jail.

507
00:41:11,715 --> 00:41:13,339
I need the room key of Chandini.

508
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:15,020
My husband is not in the city.

509
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:17,340
I don't even know
where he kept the keys.

510
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,616
Do you have a hammer?

511
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:23,087
For what?
- I will break it.

512
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:13,451
How long it's been that I saw you!

513
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:16,294
I cried all these days
because you were not there.

514
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:20,053
My heart was happy, once I saw you.

515
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,072
You are so cute with those rings.

516
00:42:28,938 --> 00:42:30,954
It was me who took this photo.

517
00:42:31,607 --> 00:42:34,284
Remember me as well.
What do you say?

518
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:40,433
I enjoyed a lot that day
in your village.

519
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:43,565
What was that festival? Bonalu?

520
00:46:48,587 --> 00:46:51,611
Brother,
I decoded the phone you gave me.

521
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:54,081
We got him.
- What's his name?

522
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:55,597
Jamaal.

523
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:57,824
Jamaal.

524
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:05,394
Today morning,
the Prime Minister asked again.

525
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:07,903
Yes, sir.
- What's going on in the case?

526
00:47:08,315 --> 00:47:10,600
Speed up the enquiry.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,422
I need the results at the earliest.
- Sure, sir. Okay.

528
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,360
Yes. Okay.

529
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,353
I don't understand
what you're doing?

530
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:18,410
We are trying, sir.

531
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,644
I need to answer the Prime Minister.

532
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:20,839
Yes, sir. Yes.

533
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:22,585
I want result soon.
- Okay.

534
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,007
Okay! Okay!

535
00:47:25,546 --> 00:47:27,134
Hey, where is Arun?

536
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,116
Arun, centre is killing me.

537
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,228
Everything is dependent
on your investigation.

538
00:47:46,308 --> 00:47:48,291
How far did it come? Where are you?

539
00:47:48,525 --> 00:47:49,565
Sir!

540
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:51,705
I am at the spot.

541
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,045
We almost cracked the case.

542
00:47:54,932 --> 00:47:57,088
You'll be surprised to know
who's behind this case.

543
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:00,273
Who? What's the name?

544
00:48:00,353 --> 00:48:02,028
Sir, if I say it,
it will be horrible.

545
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:04,163
Then tell me urgently.

546
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:05,833
Someone is coming.

547
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,982
Wait for a minute.

548
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,156
Shankar is also here.

549
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:13,893
Something mysterious.

550
00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:17,379
I will call you back.
- Damn it!

551
00:48:50,753 --> 00:48:52,517
Are you here for Jamaal?
- Yes.

552
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:54,029
Did you meet him before?

553
00:48:54,654 --> 00:48:56,742
No. I am seeing him just now.

554
00:48:59,038 --> 00:49:00,414
Do you know 'Hawala Prakash'?

555
00:49:01,786 --> 00:49:03,907
Except my uncle,
I don't know anyone else.

556
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:07,547
Then you came from that side

557
00:49:07,954 --> 00:49:09,150
and I came from this side.

558
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,176
Then who killed him?

559
00:49:18,817 --> 00:49:19,874
It's a trap.

560
00:51:20,482 --> 00:51:23,237
Sir, our agent, he is on death bed.

561
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:25,429
He was the one
who was investigating till now.

562
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:27,068
The complete information
is with him.

563
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:28,782
I don't understand what do I do now?

564
00:51:29,226 --> 00:51:31,854
You do anything,
I need that information.

565
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:34,130
Or else the Prime Minister
will kill me.

566
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,955
Yes, sir. Okay, sir.

567
00:52:43,315 --> 00:52:45,908
Sarah, please calm down.

568
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,681
I need to talk to you.

569
00:52:48,681 --> 00:52:49,925
Sarah, please listen.

570
00:52:50,975 --> 00:52:54,208
Arun said that you are working
on memory transfer.

571
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:59,101
I saw your Science meet regarding
memory transfer in the TV once.

572
00:53:00,326 --> 00:53:01,840
Can we do it over humans?

573
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,913
Sarah, I'm asking you.
Can you do it on humans?

574
00:53:07,373 --> 00:53:09,902
We didn't do it till now.
But that's our idea.

575
00:53:10,413 --> 00:53:12,277
I have a lot of pressure from Delhi.

576
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:15,325
I need Arun memory.

577
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:17,204
He has some
confidential information.

578
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:19,732
I need to know what it is.
It's very important.

579
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:21,532
Can you take Arun's memory

580
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:23,730
and put it to him?

581
00:53:25,113 --> 00:53:27,469
We can try but he will die, sir.

582
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:35,633
Can you transfer it to him?
- He will die, sir.

583
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,536
It's fine, even if he dies.
He is a criminal.

584
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:39,719
Who cares
whether he is dead or alive?

585
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:42,478
Sarah, we don't have time.

586
00:53:43,117 --> 00:53:44,778
If we are success for just once

587
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:47,443
you will have Arun's memories.

588
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:50,492
Then it would be like
Arun is still alive.

589
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:52,238
Please try.

590
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:58,433
I know it's illegal to do this.

591
00:53:58,513 --> 00:54:01,291
But we have to do it.
Remove his and keep it to him.

592
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,098
Please.
- Okay, sir.

593
00:55:07,214 --> 00:55:08,538
Where am I?

594
00:55:10,385 --> 00:55:11,723
What is this pain?

595
00:55:11,803 --> 00:55:14,153
Those idiots shot me in the chest.

596
00:55:14,964 --> 00:55:16,271
Who are you?

597
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:26,495
Is he alive or dead?

598
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,303
Why are you giving
current shock to him?

599
00:55:35,142 --> 00:55:36,241
Hey, you...

600
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,488
Why are you staring at me like that?

601
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:45,197
Handcuffs?

602
00:55:45,658 --> 00:55:46,974
Who put these handcuffs to me?

603
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,709
Did you?
- No.

604
00:55:49,005 --> 00:55:52,798
Who was it?

605
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:56,727
Hey, what's going on here?

606
00:55:59,828 --> 00:56:01,332
What's that injection?

607
00:56:01,412 --> 00:56:02,333
If you give me

608
00:56:02,413 --> 00:56:03,936
I will come to your house
and kill you.

609
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:06,284
You go ahead. Hey, catch him.

610
00:56:08,526 --> 00:56:09,850
Hey, leave me. Leave.

611
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,800
Don't you know how to hold him?
- What's going on?

612
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,902
Silent.

613
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,189
Silent. Why are you so afraid
of this small injection?

614
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:18,384
I am telling you no injection.

615
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:19,731
See, I will kill you.
- Silent.

616
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:20,788
What are you giving me?
- Silent.

617
00:56:20,868 --> 00:56:22,454
No, don't.

618
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:24,966
You...

619
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,202
I feel something's fishy.

620
00:56:28,282 --> 00:56:30,094
If something happens to me

621
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:32,056
I will kill you, man.

622
00:56:32,796 --> 00:56:34,787
Why can't I see him properly?

623
00:56:36,486 --> 00:56:38,967
I am feeling sleepy very soon.

624
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:40,953
Did you drug me?

625
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:43,909
I will peel off
each one of your skins.

626
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:45,703
Skin.

627
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:47,586
Skin.

628
00:56:48,879 --> 00:56:49,975
Skin.

629
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,237
Doctor! He is ready.

630
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,644
Sir operation is over.

631
00:58:39,706 --> 00:58:41,065
Tell me one thing.

632
00:58:41,443 --> 00:58:43,105
Now what will happen next?

633
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:45,806
All the strong memories
are stored in the Hipo Compass.

634
00:58:45,886 --> 00:58:48,008
Shankar's memories would be deleted.

635
00:58:48,088 --> 00:58:50,322
Slowly, Arun's memories
will occupy his brain.

636
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,298
But it will take some time.
- Oh!

637
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:56,068
So slowly,
Shankar will forget the past.

638
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:57,227
That's it?

639
00:58:57,307 --> 00:58:58,397
Yes, sir.

640
00:59:03,948 --> 00:59:07,377
'Hey,
I will break your face, idiot.'

641
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,980
'Don't talk unnecessary things.'

642
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:14,215
'We are Hyderabad girls.'

643
00:59:14,295 --> 00:59:16,136
'If you make friendship,
we will give our life for you.'

644
00:59:16,216 --> 00:59:18,369
'If you do enemity,
we will take you away.'

645
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:22,082
'What will you do with me
after kidnapping?'

646
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:24,014
'I will kill you and bury you.'

647
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:26,212
'Are you so angry on me?'

648
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:28,192
'Yes, idiot.'

649
00:59:32,551 --> 00:59:34,831
'Is it?
Shoot me if you are dare enough.'

650
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:39,106
'You don't know about me.'

651
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,008
'The bullet will go
from the bottom to top.'

652
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:44,804
'Then shoot me from bottom to top.'

653
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:46,164
'Hey!
- Shoot! Come on.'

654
00:59:46,244 --> 00:59:47,399
'Hey!
- Shoot!'

655
00:59:47,479 --> 00:59:49,099
'Hey don't, idiot.
- Shoot.'

656
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:51,949
'Chandini is fire.
Don't play with fire.'

657
00:59:52,029 --> 00:59:53,706
'Is it? Whom did you shoot?'

658
00:59:53,786 --> 00:59:55,283
'Why?'

659
00:59:56,705 --> 00:59:57,740
'You idiot.'

660
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,092
'I will shoot you for real.
Don't enrage me.'

661
01:00:00,172 --> 01:00:02,083
'What's the name of your mother?'

662
01:00:04,898 --> 01:00:07,157
'What did my mother do?
Why do you drag them into this?'

663
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,606
'I will cut your tongue, you idiot.
You character less fellow.'

664
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,470
'Do you have the character?'

665
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,540
'I have it.
- Then shoot me.'

666
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,083
'However bad I speak to you,
you'll not shoot me.'

667
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,295
'Because you fell for me.'

668
01:00:32,367 --> 01:00:34,881
'Your father, your mother'

669
01:00:35,322 --> 01:00:37,830
'you will come for me
leaving behind everyone.'

670
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,455
'I know it.'

671
01:00:40,255 --> 01:00:42,623
'You girls do the same
when you are in love.'

672
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:47,900
'I will not. What do you think?
Why will I fall for you?'

673
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,960
'You fell for me.'

674
01:00:50,294 --> 01:00:52,110
'You fell in my trap.'

675
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:53,925
'How do you know?'

676
01:00:56,113 --> 01:00:58,369
'Ismart Shankar.'

677
01:00:58,449 --> 01:01:02,822
'Special brain.'

678
01:01:12,805 --> 01:01:14,080
Oh, God!

679
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,355
Hello? Can you hear me?

680
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,993
Can you listen to me?

681
01:01:22,769 --> 01:01:24,320
Is it paining a lot?

682
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:27,354
What's your name?

683
01:01:28,071 --> 01:01:29,420
What's your name?

684
01:01:30,661 --> 01:01:31,869
Hello.

685
01:01:32,649 --> 01:01:34,292
You want to go to the toilet?

686
01:01:34,372 --> 01:01:36,456
Yes.
- Wait. I will open.

687
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:40,292
Be careful.

688
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:41,700
Slowly.
- One minute.

689
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:42,959
Be careful.

690
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,999
You will not ask me any questions

691
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:46,535
I'll ask you.

692
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:49,407
What's your name?
- Sarah.

693
01:01:51,631 --> 01:01:54,376
Are you a doctor?
- No. Nueroscientist.

694
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,231
Did you sell my kidneys?

695
01:02:00,557 --> 01:02:03,017
Did you cut my liver?
- No, no.

696
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:05,793
What is this pain?

697
01:02:05,873 --> 01:02:07,522
Is it paining?
I will just get a tablet.

698
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:14,348
What's the name of this hospital?
- Not hospital, it's a lab.

699
01:02:15,931 --> 01:02:18,236
You are not a doctor,
this is not a hospital

700
01:02:18,316 --> 01:02:20,342
you are certainly the batch
who cuts livers.

701
01:02:20,422 --> 01:02:22,332
No, no. You are in a safe zone.

702
01:02:22,412 --> 01:02:24,052
This is highly restricted area.

703
01:02:24,132 --> 01:02:26,089
That is
Central Bureau of Investigation.

704
01:02:26,169 --> 01:02:27,564
What?
- CBI.

705
01:02:27,832 --> 01:02:28,850
Is it police?

706
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:30,346
Hey, hey.
- Don't move.

707
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:32,335
Don't move.
- Throw away the scissors.

708
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,762
Don't do anything in hurry.

709
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:36,055
If you are with us,
it's good for department

710
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:38,602
good for society, good for many.

711
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,911
Then what about me?
- What?

712
01:02:41,668 --> 01:02:44,206
Uncle, don't try to enlighten me.

713
01:02:44,468 --> 01:02:48,170
Seeing cat as blind,
the rat jumped a lot it seems.

714
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,728
I am not fool.

715
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:53,443
Shankar. Ustaad ismart Shankar.

716
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:54,544
Hey, catch him.

717
01:03:08,921 --> 01:03:10,453
Hey, don't shoot.

718
01:03:12,078 --> 01:03:13,793
I will shoot you.
- Then shoot.

719
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,074
Sir, please catch him.

720
01:04:07,154 --> 01:04:09,167
He needs medication.
He is in danger.

721
01:04:09,247 --> 01:04:10,998
He should be in observation.
Please get him back.

722
01:04:11,078 --> 01:04:13,460
Alright, fast. Catch him. Go.

723
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,594
Hey!

724
01:05:17,928 --> 01:05:19,635
What happened to me?

725
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:56,428
Sir! We are searching, sir. Over.

726
01:05:57,015 --> 01:05:58,139
Hello, where?

727
01:05:58,618 --> 01:05:59,860
What are you doing there?

728
01:06:00,265 --> 01:06:01,390
Did you get him?

729
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:04,644
What a life! Take u-turn.

730
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:07,508
Catch that idiot immediately.
Police shouldn't know it.

731
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,524
Memory transfer matter
shouldn't come out.

732
01:06:09,604 --> 01:06:11,120
Human rights problems will arise.

733
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,609
"Come, girl. Come, come..."

734
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:16,623
"Give me the lemon juice."

735
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,011
"I will come, dear."

736
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:21,320
"My Laddu like Palakova."

737
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,982
My Laddu like..
- Palakova.

738
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,282
My Laddu like..
- Palakova.

739
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,046
Brother!

740
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:31,915
Who is she?

741
01:06:32,282 --> 01:06:35,615
Brother, I am afraid to sleep alone
these days.

742
01:06:35,946 --> 01:06:37,414
That's why I brought a support.

743
01:06:37,762 --> 01:06:39,858
Hey, you go.
- Hey, wait.

744
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:42,814
Do you know who I am?

745
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:44,639
Yes, I know you.

746
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:47,812
You are the one
who escaped from jail. Right?

747
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:50,988
They showed you on TV.

748
01:06:51,068 --> 01:06:54,083
You are very smart in the photo.

749
01:06:55,195 --> 01:06:56,591
You let her stay here.

750
01:06:56,671 --> 01:06:57,904
What happened, brother?

751
01:06:57,984 --> 01:06:59,963
Come here. See this.

752
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,645
You kept a hole there.

753
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:06,369
You also put something inside.
What is it, brother?

754
01:07:06,449 --> 01:07:08,192
I didn't keep it.
- Then who kept it?

755
01:07:08,272 --> 01:07:09,725
Police.
- Police?

756
01:07:10,203 --> 01:07:13,480
Brother, the police kept SIM card
in your head.

757
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,401
SIM card in head?
What are you saying?

758
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:17,743
Yes, brother.
You go anywhere, you'll be caught.

759
01:07:24,544 --> 01:07:26,490
Brother, let's tell this information
to uncle.

760
01:07:26,763 --> 01:07:27,690
Uncle is not there.

761
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:28,975
Uncle is not there? Where did he go?

762
01:07:29,055 --> 01:07:30,117
I killed him.

763
01:07:30,532 --> 01:07:32,614
You killed uncle?
- Yes.

764
01:07:33,122 --> 01:07:35,161
I need to kill one more.
- Who, brother?

765
01:07:35,525 --> 01:07:37,273
I don't know.
But I have to kill him.

766
01:07:38,024 --> 01:07:39,134
Brother, what happened?

767
01:07:39,214 --> 01:07:41,075
I feel like some signals, man.

768
01:07:41,155 --> 01:07:42,539
I told you, brother.

769
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:43,876
Tell me the number of that SIM card,
brother.

770
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:45,992
If i give a missed call,
everything will be set straight.

771
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:49,889
Hey you, half brain fellow. Leave.

772
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:51,226
Brother.

773
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:01,362
Why am I remembering her?
- Who, brother?

774
01:08:01,442 --> 01:08:02,708
She is the one who made a hole.

775
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:05,491
Then, let's make a hole to her also.
Come, brother.

776
01:08:11,236 --> 01:08:12,576
There is the idol.

777
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:14,436
Stop! Stop! Stop!

778
01:08:14,816 --> 01:08:17,801
You keep SIM card in my brain?
Get on.

779
01:08:19,693 --> 01:08:21,738
Help. Somebody please help me.
- Hey!

780
01:08:21,818 --> 01:08:24,605
Somebody.
- Hey! I will kill you.

781
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:28,304
What did you do?
My brain is revolving.

782
01:08:28,925 --> 01:08:30,356
One second, one second.

783
01:08:31,924 --> 01:08:33,656
What else do you feel?

784
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:37,256
I feel something like shock.

785
01:08:37,336 --> 01:08:38,787
See, it's like getting shock.

786
01:08:38,867 --> 01:08:41,168
Good. It's working.
One second! One second!

787
01:08:41,248 --> 01:08:42,550
Working?

788
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:47,282
What else do you feel?
- I feel like killing you.

789
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,784
No, no.
Please, we will go to my house.

790
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:51,746
Why?
- You need treatment.

791
01:08:51,826 --> 01:08:54,587
Listen to me.
I need to do an injection urgently.

792
01:09:02,187 --> 01:09:03,943
Tell me, what did you do?

793
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:24,189
Memory transfer.

794
01:09:24,598 --> 01:09:27,012
Arun's memory
was kept in your brain.

795
01:09:28,432 --> 01:09:30,858
Arun means?
The one who was dead the other day?

796
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:32,795
Yes. It was him.

797
01:09:33,568 --> 01:09:36,094
He was investigating
Kasi Viswanadh's murder case.

798
01:09:36,394 --> 01:09:38,626
And CBI chief
wants to know the truth.

799
01:09:38,706 --> 01:09:40,366
So we did this operation.

800
01:09:41,817 --> 01:09:44,256
That means,
will I get his brain to me?

801
01:09:45,366 --> 01:09:47,093
Yes.
- Then what about mine?

802
01:09:47,446 --> 01:09:49,417
Whatever happened
in your life till now

803
01:09:49,497 --> 01:09:51,144
will get deleted slowly.

804
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,535
Then what about my girl?

805
01:09:55,139 --> 01:09:56,375
You will not remember her.

806
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:57,770
My love?

807
01:09:58,376 --> 01:09:59,735
That also you will lose.

808
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:05,581
That means

809
01:10:05,853 --> 01:10:08,546
the love for which I have been
living all these days will be lost?

810
01:10:09,582 --> 01:10:11,989
The rage with which I am living,
will be gone from here?

811
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:15,972
Yes! Slowly you will become Arun.

812
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:27,657
Then why are you coming in my mind?
- Am I coming?

813
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:28,721
Yes.

814
01:10:29,095 --> 01:10:31,997
That you are in some beach...

815
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:36,294
Anything else?
- Why are you coming?

816
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:38,894
Because I am Arun's girl friend.

817
01:10:38,974 --> 01:10:42,932
You don't come. I don't want you.

818
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:45,365
I want my Chandini.

819
01:10:46,206 --> 01:10:50,232
Please. Stay here.
I need to take care of you.

820
01:10:51,112 --> 01:10:53,127
Before I forget everything.

821
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,075
I have to kill him. I will kill him.

822
01:11:03,753 --> 01:11:04,698
Hello.

823
01:11:04,778 --> 01:11:06,584
Sir, I just met him. It's working.

824
01:11:06,664 --> 01:11:07,567
Working means?

825
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:09,304
Our operation is success, sir.
- Yes.

826
01:11:09,617 --> 01:11:11,992
Slowly Arun's memories
are coming into him.

827
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:13,165
Did he tell you any secret?

828
01:11:13,245 --> 01:11:14,174
No, sir.

829
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:15,645
He left immediately.

830
01:11:15,725 --> 01:11:17,592
He left? Where did he go?

831
01:11:21,493 --> 01:11:22,863
Can you hear it?

832
01:11:25,706 --> 01:11:27,262
Let's start it now.

833
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:48,696
So what happened, boss?

834
01:11:48,776 --> 01:11:50,742
Are you a kid, idiot?

835
01:11:50,822 --> 01:11:52,177
Play DJ.

836
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,173
What is this, man?
Girls are one above another.

837
01:13:22,599 --> 01:13:24,907
Oh, my. Something horrible
is happening here.

838
01:15:52,142 --> 01:15:54,953
[indistinct chatter continue]

839
01:16:01,235 --> 01:16:03,627
You got caught very well.

840
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:05,469
You will be killed by me today.

841
01:16:05,549 --> 01:16:07,564
I know that you will come here.

842
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:09,525
That's why I danced in public.

843
01:16:09,605 --> 01:16:11,082
Forget dancing from today.

844
01:16:11,162 --> 01:16:12,968
This was your last dance, idiot.

845
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:21,014
Hey, I don't have much time.

846
01:16:21,094 --> 01:16:23,266
I don't have space in my brain.

847
01:16:23,346 --> 01:16:27,303
Tell me his name fast.
I will remember it.

848
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,817
Hey, don't leave him today.

849
01:16:33,897 --> 01:16:35,422
I will also not leave.

850
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:38,359
If it is then Aithpur,
or else it's Narayanpur.

851
01:16:59,904 --> 01:17:02,992
Sir, we got Shankar in Dhaba.

852
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:10,973
Tell me the name. Who is my villain?

853
01:17:13,058 --> 01:17:16,587
Tell me the name of that person
who has sent you.

854
01:17:22,657 --> 01:17:23,616
Beat him. Don't spare him.

855
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:27,560
It is little difficult to kill him,
but we will kill him today.

856
01:17:39,546 --> 01:17:40,447
Yes, sir.

857
01:17:40,527 --> 01:17:41,654
He should not come to me.

858
01:17:41,734 --> 01:17:42,781
Okay.

859
01:17:47,089 --> 01:17:50,029
Hey don't hit there.
Don't beat on the head.

860
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:50,994
I will beat there only.

861
01:17:51,074 --> 01:17:53,255
I will beat there,
where there is defect.

862
01:17:55,878 --> 01:17:58,294
I told you not to beat on the brain,
right?

863
01:17:58,374 --> 01:17:59,730
Idiot.

864
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,461
I will call you
once the work is done.

865
01:18:17,186 --> 01:18:18,377
Oh, God!

866
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,151
Hey!

867
01:18:44,515 --> 01:18:46,485
Hey idiot,
you don't have gun in your hand.

868
01:18:46,565 --> 01:18:47,776
Why are you making such sound?

869
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,214
You scared us...

870
01:18:53,449 --> 01:18:56,003
What's this mind, man?
It's like double SIM card phone.

871
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:57,401
Why like that?

872
01:18:57,481 --> 01:19:00,918
Because I am one
and one more inside.

873
01:19:11,745 --> 01:19:13,796
Brother, police is coming.

874
01:19:14,177 --> 01:19:17,070
Run! Run! Run!

875
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,053
Catch them.

876
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:21,228
Run!

877
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:24,127
His mind is not in place.
He's not normal.

878
01:19:24,207 --> 01:19:25,813
We have seen many mad people.

879
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:27,771
But he... he is like...

880
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:29,551
Half 'Bhojpuri film' villain.

881
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,371
Whatever it is...

882
01:19:32,015 --> 01:19:33,632
See that he doesn't come to me.

883
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,621
My name shouldn't come out.

884
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,463
We will get ruined.

885
01:19:37,543 --> 01:19:38,879
There will not be
any political career.

886
01:19:38,959 --> 01:19:40,607
Elections in six months.
- Uncle.

887
01:19:40,687 --> 01:19:41,720
Come we will have food.

888
01:19:44,002 --> 01:19:45,200
Who are they?

889
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,733
Our guys. They came here on a work.

890
01:19:51,764 --> 01:19:53,016
Brother, shall we go home?

891
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:54,529
Home?

892
01:19:55,548 --> 01:19:56,579
House?

893
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,788
Take left now.

894
01:20:06,841 --> 01:20:07,905
Take right.

895
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:11,980
Go straight.

896
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:14,495
Stop here.

897
01:20:18,575 --> 01:20:19,900
Is this the house?

898
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,429
Brother, this is not our house.

899
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:26,728
You go. I will come later.
- Okay.

900
01:20:47,392 --> 01:20:48,515
It's working.

901
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:50,851
It's his house.

902
01:20:55,238 --> 01:20:57,431
I feel like I know everything.

903
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:10,551
Her photo.

904
01:21:13,382 --> 01:21:14,921
I told it.

905
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:19,710
I pray you.

906
01:21:20,992 --> 01:21:23,097
Everything is happening as you told.

907
01:21:23,433 --> 01:21:25,369
You mixed mind and mind.

908
01:21:26,655 --> 01:21:28,174
It's working.

909
01:21:29,525 --> 01:21:31,652
Prakash! Jamal...

910
01:21:32,663 --> 01:21:34,026
What is this?

911
01:22:01,575 --> 01:22:03,114
'CBI Investigation.'

912
01:22:09,115 --> 01:22:11,814
'Tell me Shankar, why did you kill?'

913
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:13,258
'I didn't kill.'

914
01:22:13,781 --> 01:22:15,021
'Who's behind you?'

915
01:22:15,494 --> 01:22:17,252
'Even I want to know it.'

916
01:22:19,756 --> 01:22:21,522
'Who is behind this?'

917
01:22:25,452 --> 01:22:27,997
'Shankar. if you co-operate
that will be good for you.'

918
01:22:28,706 --> 01:22:29,814
'Tell me, what happened?'

919
01:22:29,894 --> 01:22:31,589
'You tell me what happened?'

920
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:33,772
'How do the police know
that I am there?'

921
01:22:35,068 --> 01:22:37,315
'Why did they open fire on me?'

922
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:40,526
'Did I have any weapons?'

923
01:22:41,327 --> 01:22:43,324
'Why did you call my girl?'

924
01:22:48,696 --> 01:22:51,799
'Mr. Dharam, I'm asking you.
Who called you?'

925
01:22:52,143 --> 01:22:54,663
'It was an anonymous call.
- Where did you get it from?'

926
01:22:54,743 --> 01:22:56,345
'Sir.
- What is the area?'

927
01:22:56,676 --> 01:22:58,169
'Can you please tell me about it?'

928
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:28,451
Why did we take Arun's brain
and fix it to him?

929
01:23:28,531 --> 01:23:30,217
To see if he tells us any secrets.

930
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,319
He is already a criminal.

931
01:23:33,395 --> 01:23:35,601
What if he misuses Arun's brain?

932
01:23:36,347 --> 01:23:38,356
Everyone will be in trouble.

933
01:23:58,268 --> 01:24:00,176
Sir, this is Arun speaking.

934
01:24:00,256 --> 01:24:01,626
He is talking like Arun.

935
01:24:01,706 --> 01:24:02,732
Hello.

936
01:24:02,812 --> 01:24:05,434
Sir, I need some urgent information.

937
01:24:05,816 --> 01:24:08,766
20 million was transferred to
'Hawala Prakash's' account.

938
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,282
Can you please trace and tell me

939
01:24:10,362 --> 01:24:11,503
from where this amount
was transferred?

940
01:24:12,096 --> 01:24:14,401
This information is really crucial
for this case, sir.

941
01:24:14,481 --> 01:24:15,988
By the way, where are you now?

942
01:24:16,068 --> 01:24:16,978
Why, sir?

943
01:24:17,058 --> 01:24:18,914
I need to talk to you urgently
about this case.

944
01:24:18,994 --> 01:24:20,978
Tell me, where are you?
We will all be there.

945
01:24:41,935 --> 01:24:43,377
Sir!
- What's happening?

946
01:24:43,457 --> 01:24:44,762
A lot happened, sir.

947
01:24:45,074 --> 01:24:47,055
Suspect one is 'Hawala Prakash'.

948
01:24:47,338 --> 01:24:48,645
He is the one who called the police.

949
01:24:48,725 --> 01:24:49,867
He withdrew money

950
01:24:49,947 --> 01:24:51,903
and gave it to Suspect two, Jamal.

951
01:24:52,497 --> 01:24:55,515
But unfortunately,
before I went there they killed him.

952
01:24:56,398 --> 01:24:58,033
What we could conclude
in the further investigation was

953
01:24:58,113 --> 01:24:59,751
all this money is drawn
from a company called

954
01:24:59,831 --> 01:25:01,221
All India Entertainments.

955
01:25:02,289 --> 01:25:04,073
You need to trace
who's behind that company's hub

956
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:06,333
and this bag is the proof.

957
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:09,087
How did you get this bag?

958
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:15,462
How did you get this bag?

959
01:25:17,293 --> 01:25:19,882
This? Jamal has given this to uncle.

960
01:25:20,539 --> 01:25:22,343
Uncle gave me this.
I kept it in that girl's house.

961
01:25:22,423 --> 01:25:24,096
Arun, what are you talking?

962
01:25:25,337 --> 01:25:27,122
Hey Arun, what are you talking?

963
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:31,203
He didn't come completely yet.

964
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:34,165
You are the one
who spoiled my brain, right?

965
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,555
Who are you, man? Idiot!
- Wait...

966
01:25:37,635 --> 01:25:38,905
Sir!
- Hey!

967
01:25:40,591 --> 01:25:42,272
If you point the gun
he will object you.

968
01:25:42,352 --> 01:25:44,502
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- I told you, right?

969
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:46,271
Smart.

970
01:25:47,961 --> 01:25:49,384
Uncle! 'Sakuni uncle!'

971
01:25:49,464 --> 01:25:50,949
You are dead today.

972
01:25:53,034 --> 01:25:55,363
Let us beat you, man. CBI?

973
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:01,465
Stop it, Shankar. Don't shoot.

974
01:26:02,136 --> 01:26:03,797
I will make a hole
for each one of you.

975
01:26:03,877 --> 01:26:04,937
Hey! Don't shoot.
- Please, don't shoot!

976
01:26:05,017 --> 01:26:06,361
I'll celebrate
11th day ceremony for all.

977
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:07,630
Shankar...

978
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:09,750
Hey, you come. Get on the vehicle.
I have some work with you.

979
01:26:10,427 --> 01:26:13,851
Get on.
- Shankar...

980
01:26:17,596 --> 01:26:18,782
Damn it!

981
01:26:26,506 --> 01:26:27,637
Hello.
- Hey!

982
01:26:27,717 --> 01:26:29,427
Why is he talking like Shankar,
again?

983
01:26:29,507 --> 01:26:31,713
Sir, no, no. It's a memory recall.

984
01:26:31,976 --> 01:26:34,236
That means,
retrieving information from past.

985
01:26:35,163 --> 01:26:36,462
There would be
three kinds of recalls.

986
01:26:36,542 --> 01:26:37,920
Pre-recall! Queue-recall!

987
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,491
And Serial-recall!
- Hey, quiet.

988
01:26:39,571 --> 01:26:40,490
Damn it!

989
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,163
Who are you talking to?
- Sir, please don't follow us.

990
01:26:42,243 --> 01:26:43,430
I will take care of him. Trust me.
- Here.

991
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,539
I will kill you,
if you are talking to that idiot.

992
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:47,638
Damn it!

993
01:26:54,189 --> 01:26:55,907
Where are you taking me?

994
01:27:22,903 --> 01:27:25,251
The mind is full of her videos.

995
01:27:25,652 --> 01:27:27,567
Hey, get up.

996
01:27:28,268 --> 01:27:31,019
Why did I bring you?
Not to take care of me?

997
01:27:31,099 --> 01:27:32,594
Yes.
- Then look at me.

998
01:27:32,907 --> 01:27:35,166
I am getting current shocks
in the middle.

999
01:27:35,246 --> 01:27:37,838
If I hit something,
you will also die.

1000
01:27:38,798 --> 01:27:40,396
She is sleeping happily.

1001
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:45,883
In how many days
will it be deleted?

1002
01:27:46,896 --> 01:27:49,399
For rats,
it will complete in 2-3 days.

1003
01:27:49,769 --> 01:27:51,734
Rats? What rats?

1004
01:27:51,814 --> 01:27:54,264
Actually what I did on rats

1005
01:27:54,344 --> 01:27:58,625
for the first time, I did on humans.
So I don't know how much

1006
01:27:58,705 --> 01:28:01,563
time it wil take.
- So, am I the first one?

1007
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:02,800
Yes.

1008
01:28:05,925 --> 01:28:08,361
Now if my brain get's deleted,
will you be given an award?

1009
01:28:08,975 --> 01:28:10,333
Yes.

1010
01:28:11,808 --> 01:28:13,800
You buried me for this award.

1011
01:28:14,095 --> 01:28:16,405
You should have kept this hole
to that CBI chief.

1012
01:28:16,485 --> 01:28:17,889
Why did you keep it to me?

1013
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,386
What is his name?
- Parameswaran.

1014
01:28:23,574 --> 01:28:25,158
First I need to bury him.

1015
01:28:25,652 --> 01:28:28,008
If you don't mind,
I'll ask you one thing.

1016
01:28:28,088 --> 01:28:29,184
Ask.

1017
01:28:29,264 --> 01:28:31,568
Why did you become a criminal?
- What?

1018
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:35,602
Why did you become a criminal?

1019
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:38,339
What does your 'Kaka' do?

1020
01:28:38,419 --> 01:28:39,361
'Kaka' means?

1021
01:28:39,441 --> 01:28:40,341
Uncle.

1022
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:42,923
Oh! He's a professor
at Oxford University.

1023
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:46,961
Do you know who my 'Kaka' is?

1024
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,525
He's a 420.

1025
01:28:50,831 --> 01:28:52,125
He's ***

1026
01:28:53,018 --> 01:28:54,529
He's ***

1027
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:57,018
He's ***

1028
01:28:57,883 --> 01:29:00,830
You were brought up in house,
I was brought up in dirt.

1029
01:29:25,724 --> 01:29:26,782
Yes.

1030
01:29:35,657 --> 01:29:38,794
Mother! Daddy's born again.

1031
01:29:39,368 --> 01:29:43,621
I see your father's smile
in his face, dear.

1032
01:29:44,787 --> 01:29:47,213
Should I be happy that he is born or

1033
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:50,672
should I be sad
that your father's murderer

1034
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:51,860
is roaming freely?

1035
01:29:52,296 --> 01:29:53,383
Mother.

1036
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:59,364
Hey, promise me that you will kill
your father's murderer.

1037
01:29:59,444 --> 01:30:03,194
Mother, I promise on dad.

1038
01:30:04,104 --> 01:30:05,947
I will bring the murderer

1039
01:30:06,027 --> 01:30:07,467
who is the reason
for dad's death in front of you

1040
01:30:07,547 --> 01:30:10,211
and will stab him
and cut him to pieces.

1041
01:30:10,359 --> 01:30:11,489
Yes.

1042
01:30:27,136 --> 01:30:31,503
'Hey, idiot.
What are you doing in that beach?'

1043
01:30:32,241 --> 01:30:33,887
I made a hole in the fish

1044
01:30:33,967 --> 01:30:36,570
sticked a stick in it
and fire in the bottom.

1045
01:30:47,156 --> 01:30:51,323
Apply spices to it, fry it hot

1046
01:30:51,403 --> 01:30:54,635
then eat it in cool breeze.

1047
01:31:08,901 --> 01:31:10,251
Why did you beat me?

1048
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:12,937
It's my habit to beat
before doing anything wrong.

1049
01:31:13,017 --> 01:31:14,294
What did I do now?

1050
01:31:14,374 --> 01:31:16,682
I know what's in your mind.

1051
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:18,349
Okay. What's in my mind?

1052
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,696
Eat this fish, drink that alcohol

1053
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:24,739
get me wet in sea,
put this fire down

1054
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:27,825
you thought of doing something
in this moonlight. Right?

1055
01:31:28,806 --> 01:31:32,071
Oh my God. I thought the same.

1056
01:31:32,151 --> 01:31:33,534
How do you know?

1057
01:31:34,344 --> 01:31:35,796
Did you scan my mind?

1058
01:31:35,876 --> 01:31:39,200
When everything can be seen on face
why do I need to scan, man?

1059
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:42,231
Here, don't plan such things. Okay?

1060
01:31:42,587 --> 01:31:45,285
If anything happens it happens,
or it will not.

1061
01:31:45,365 --> 01:31:46,320
Whatever happens

1062
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,242
it should be like accident.
That's it.

1063
01:31:48,322 --> 01:31:49,897
Then we'll plan accident itself.

1064
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:52,692
Do you think I am a fool?

1065
01:31:52,772 --> 01:31:55,357
To bring you this far
and wait for accident?

1066
01:31:55,737 --> 01:31:57,711
If we wait for the accident

1067
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:59,754
who knows which vehicle comes

1068
01:31:59,834 --> 01:32:01,209
and hits which vehicle?

1069
01:32:01,289 --> 01:32:03,181
See I am telling you, listen.

1070
01:32:03,261 --> 01:32:05,472
We are friends.
We should hit each other.

1071
01:32:05,552 --> 01:32:06,526
What?

1072
01:32:09,353 --> 01:32:10,857
How were you born?

1073
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:13,544
Don't you have any shame?
- No.

1074
01:32:13,989 --> 01:32:16,064
Hey, I am telling you.

1075
01:32:16,144 --> 01:32:20,107
Remove such stupid thoughts
from your mind.

1076
01:32:20,805 --> 01:32:23,130
Remove. Did you understand?

1077
01:32:29,838 --> 01:32:32,249
'Remove. Did you understand?'

1078
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,920
Do you remember Arun?

1079
01:33:01,927 --> 01:33:02,936
Yes.

1080
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,039
What will you do,
if you remember him?

1081
01:33:07,914 --> 01:33:09,036
I will cry.

1082
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:11,597
How many times did you cry?

1083
01:33:13,021 --> 01:33:14,892
I have been crying daily.

1084
01:33:16,877 --> 01:33:20,480
Because his memories
are safe with you.

1085
01:33:21,274 --> 01:33:24,254
But,
my Chandini is evaporating daily.

1086
01:33:26,132 --> 01:33:28,733
I will cry for her today, tomorrow

1087
01:33:29,213 --> 01:33:31,028
I don't know if I will cry
day-after-tomorrow or not.

1088
01:33:31,792 --> 01:33:34,092
If I remember that thing,
I feel like crying.

1089
01:33:39,073 --> 01:33:41,650
In our life,
love gives us happiness.

1090
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:44,276
Crying for our loved ones
also gives same happiness.

1091
01:33:45,568 --> 01:33:47,227
You made me lose that happiness.

1092
01:33:52,854 --> 01:33:55,453
If I did any mistake,
my girl used to slap me hard.

1093
01:33:56,064 --> 01:33:58,501
Who will beat me,
if I did something wrong?

1094
01:34:02,556 --> 01:34:05,371
You placed something here, right?
Will you remove it?

1095
01:34:05,588 --> 01:34:06,942
It's paining, Sarah.

1096
01:34:07,404 --> 01:34:08,499
Not there.

1097
01:34:09,841 --> 01:34:10,890
Here.

1098
01:34:18,396 --> 01:34:19,482
Pinky.

1099
01:34:20,337 --> 01:34:21,449
What did you say?

1100
01:34:22,555 --> 01:34:24,524
Arun calls me like this.

1101
01:34:26,957 --> 01:34:28,009
Hey!

1102
01:34:29,037 --> 01:34:31,821
I don't want. I am not your Arun.

1103
01:34:34,066 --> 01:34:35,974
Shankar.

1104
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:37,923
Shankar.

1105
01:34:49,854 --> 01:34:52,789
Shankar.

1106
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:04,898
Sarah, is he Shankar or Arun?
I am not getting any clarity.

1107
01:35:04,978 --> 01:35:07,083
Because he is behaving different
at different times.

1108
01:35:07,711 --> 01:35:09,536
He is asked me for an address.

1109
01:35:09,616 --> 01:35:10,890
I am sending it to you.

1110
01:35:11,494 --> 01:35:12,399
Give it to him.

1111
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:14,773
Let's see how he will react.
- Okay, sir.

1112
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,348
Super.

1113
01:35:48,628 --> 01:35:50,397
It's just like original rape.

1114
01:35:50,477 --> 01:35:52,888
Hey! Who are you?
Why did you come here?

1115
01:35:52,968 --> 01:35:55,588
I came to become a hero in movie.

1116
01:35:55,668 --> 01:35:57,054
This is All India Entertainments,
right?

1117
01:35:57,134 --> 01:35:59,407
There is no company here. Get lost.

1118
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:01,208
What not here, brother?

1119
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:04,012
There is a board outside
that audition is going on here.

1120
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:05,551
I also came for audition.

1121
01:36:05,631 --> 01:36:07,379
I deliver dialogues very well.

1122
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:10,793
You give me a character, brother.
I look smart on screen.

1123
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:32,970
Hey you are the one who killed me,
right?

1124
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:35,082
When did I kill you, man?
What's this?

1125
01:36:35,162 --> 01:36:36,620
You are still alive.

1126
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:41,786
Don't say stories, man.
I have a brain inside my brain.

1127
01:36:41,866 --> 01:36:45,833
Now I am,
Ustaad double ismart Shankar.

1128
01:36:47,215 --> 01:36:50,675
He should not go outside.
Close him inside.

1129
01:36:59,003 --> 01:37:00,879
Will you close me?

1130
01:37:06,385 --> 01:37:09,756
I will make your
'Baingan Ka Bartha'.

1131
01:37:34,326 --> 01:37:36,934
Hey!
- Up.

1132
01:37:45,477 --> 01:37:48,485
How is it? How is it?

1133
01:38:07,968 --> 01:38:09,931
'Panga Mein Pungi'.

1134
01:38:15,593 --> 01:38:17,687
Who gave you money?

1135
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:57,569
Tell me. What's his name?

1136
01:38:57,649 --> 01:38:59,452
No, no. I will tell you.

1137
01:39:11,045 --> 01:39:12,068
Come on, man.

1138
01:39:12,148 --> 01:39:13,091
Hey!

1139
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:26,911
'Hey, look here man.'

1140
01:39:57,125 --> 01:39:58,320
Didn't the alcohol effect get down?

1141
01:39:58,681 --> 01:39:59,877
No, it didn't get down.

1142
01:40:00,299 --> 01:40:02,696
Seeing you, it's going up.

1143
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:05,931
Don't say stupid things, you stupid.

1144
01:40:09,268 --> 01:40:10,835
I studied civil engineering

1145
01:40:10,915 --> 01:40:13,906
and why am I with you,
drinking like this?

1146
01:40:13,986 --> 01:40:16,645
if my parents come to know about it,
they will break my jaws.

1147
01:40:16,725 --> 01:40:19,569
Why will they? We will marry, right?

1148
01:40:20,343 --> 01:40:22,228
You? Me?

1149
01:40:22,627 --> 01:40:25,520
All stupid talks.

1150
01:40:26,177 --> 01:40:28,433
You will forget me and I know that.

1151
01:40:28,931 --> 01:40:30,240
Forget you?

1152
01:40:30,744 --> 01:40:33,314
Hey, to forget you

1153
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:35,497
this Shankar has to leave
his breath.

1154
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:38,119
Today I am with you.

1155
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:39,787
Maybe tomorrow,
another girl might come.

1156
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:42,077
You will forget me and I know that.

1157
01:40:42,157 --> 01:40:43,637
Hey, no way.

1158
01:40:45,217 --> 01:40:47,341
You will forget, man
and that's for sure.

1159
01:40:47,421 --> 01:40:48,857
I know it.

1160
01:40:52,221 --> 01:40:54,533
I know that you will forget me.

1161
01:41:03,777 --> 01:41:05,630
'You will forget me, idiot.'

1162
01:41:06,292 --> 01:41:07,474
'For sure.'

1163
01:41:18,709 --> 01:41:21,159
Arun, what happened? Are you okay?

1164
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:23,493
What's this blood? What happened?

1165
01:41:23,573 --> 01:41:27,747
Pinky, you are with me.
Nothing will happen to me.

1166
01:41:28,428 --> 01:41:29,773
I love you.

1167
01:41:38,133 --> 01:41:40,582
Hey did he say my name,
by any chance?

1168
01:41:40,662 --> 01:41:42,104
No, sir. He didn't.

1169
01:41:42,184 --> 01:41:43,799
Yes. Okay.

1170
01:41:43,879 --> 01:41:45,147
None of you should touch him.

1171
01:41:45,227 --> 01:41:46,764
I will send the department

1172
01:41:46,844 --> 01:41:47,979
and see that he is finished.
- Okay, sir.

1173
01:42:31,403 --> 01:42:32,831
Remember this tune, Sarah?

1174
01:42:34,957 --> 01:42:37,003
I played this tune
on your last birthday.

1175
01:42:45,708 --> 01:42:47,153
I think I know what happened.

1176
01:42:51,211 --> 01:42:53,174
Sarah, I have to tell you
what's in my mind.

1177
01:42:55,381 --> 01:42:57,394
When the bullet
went through my heart

1178
01:43:01,878 --> 01:43:03,304
I remembered only you.

1179
01:43:08,178 --> 01:43:09,871
I was falling on one side.

1180
01:43:11,282 --> 01:43:13,005
And I wanted
to say something to you.

1181
01:43:14,303 --> 01:43:15,890
But you were not there.

1182
01:43:19,252 --> 01:43:20,908
My eyes were closing.

1183
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:29,660
I was going into some unknown trans.

1184
01:43:35,272 --> 01:43:37,618
It was silence all of a sudden.

1185
01:43:44,841 --> 01:43:49,390
When my life was leaving
and my breath was stopping

1186
01:43:50,511 --> 01:43:52,610
do you know what was my last memory?

1187
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:55,145
It was this tune.

1188
01:43:56,115 --> 01:43:57,018
And you.

1189
01:48:05,675 --> 01:48:08,277
Hold your fire. This is Arun, CBI.

1190
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:09,901
CBI?

1191
01:48:15,507 --> 01:48:17,714
Sir, is that you?

1192
01:48:17,897 --> 01:48:20,663
Yes, Mr. Dharam.
Task force, CBI, North zone.

1193
01:48:21,211 --> 01:48:22,101
Why are you here?

1194
01:48:22,181 --> 01:48:24,901
We got an information
that there is a criminal here.

1195
01:48:25,879 --> 01:48:26,960
Who gave you that information?

1196
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,048
Sir! Anonymous call, sir.

1197
01:48:29,525 --> 01:48:31,524
How many times will you say the
same, that it's anonymous call?

1198
01:48:31,604 --> 01:48:33,865
Hey, move. Come on.
- Hey!

1199
01:48:41,847 --> 01:48:44,067
He is not any CBI.

1200
01:48:44,676 --> 01:48:46,072
Shoot him.

1201
01:49:22,396 --> 01:49:24,144
Why are you looking at me
standing here?

1202
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:25,593
Kill him.
- Yes, sir.

1203
01:49:27,528 --> 01:49:29,506
Hello, sir. Arun is back.

1204
01:49:29,586 --> 01:49:31,720
I don't believe it.
- No, sir.

1205
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,902
No. After sometime
he will say he is Shankar

1206
01:49:33,982 --> 01:49:35,752
and will say Arun again.
- Shankar is not there.

1207
01:49:35,832 --> 01:49:37,104
He is completely Arun.

1208
01:49:37,184 --> 01:49:38,382
What is he doing?

1209
01:49:42,191 --> 01:49:44,855
Sir, he is in action now.

1210
01:49:44,935 --> 01:49:46,177
Hey!

1211
01:49:54,664 --> 01:49:56,889
Vyas! Vyas!

1212
01:50:08,424 --> 01:50:10,116
Hey, he is killing everybody.

1213
01:50:10,196 --> 01:50:11,483
Don't leave him.

1214
01:50:31,330 --> 01:50:32,614
Hey!
- Guys, hold him.

1215
01:50:32,694 --> 01:50:33,821
What are you doing to me?
- Sarah.

1216
01:50:33,901 --> 01:50:35,045
Get back!
- What are you doing?

1217
01:50:35,125 --> 01:50:37,214
I don't want injection.
I will tell you the name.

1218
01:50:37,294 --> 01:50:40,109
I don't want injection.
- Sarah, do it. Just do it.

1219
01:50:40,909 --> 01:50:42,104
Hey, Arun.
- Don't do this.

1220
01:50:42,184 --> 01:50:43,818
Sir, I'll give you
complete information.

1221
01:50:43,898 --> 01:50:44,969
I'll tell you all details.

1222
01:50:45,049 --> 01:50:47,147
He is saying, he will tell the name.
- Yes, sir.

1223
01:50:47,227 --> 01:50:48,288
I will give you
complete information.

1224
01:50:48,368 --> 01:50:49,785
Tell me. Tell me.
- Sir, not needed.

1225
01:50:49,865 --> 01:50:51,157
You give him, Sarah. Quick.
- No.

1226
01:50:51,237 --> 01:50:53,614
No no. Please...

1227
01:50:55,761 --> 01:50:57,039
I will tell you.

1228
01:50:57,635 --> 01:50:58,825
Good job.

1229
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:02,526
Guys, I want him down
for next 48 hours. Okay?

1230
01:51:03,333 --> 01:51:04,479
If he gets up

1231
01:51:04,559 --> 01:51:05,970
give him the same injection
and make him sleep.

1232
01:51:10,425 --> 01:51:11,909
Why did you make him sleep?

1233
01:51:11,989 --> 01:51:13,455
How will we know the information?

1234
01:51:13,535 --> 01:51:15,647
Are you Shankar or Arun?

1235
01:51:16,324 --> 01:51:19,154
Sir, this is Arun,
your trusted Lieutenant.

1236
01:51:19,234 --> 01:51:21,923
2.5 meta batch memory
has been transferred.

1237
01:51:22,003 --> 01:51:23,779
That includes the case details.

1238
01:51:23,859 --> 01:51:27,202
I know who's behind
the murder of Kasi Viswanadh.

1239
01:51:27,567 --> 01:51:29,949
Who? Who?

1240
01:51:30,029 --> 01:51:32,019
It's Mr. Rammoorthy, sir.
- What?

1241
01:51:32,099 --> 01:51:34,019
Rammoorthy?
- Yes, sir.

1242
01:51:34,335 --> 01:51:37,455
Our DCP Dharam here,
is Mr. Rammoorthy's pet.

1243
01:51:37,535 --> 01:51:40,619
Using him,
Rammoorthy executed his plan.

1244
01:51:41,085 --> 01:51:43,121
It's carefully created
a chain of people

1245
01:51:43,201 --> 01:51:44,998
and Shankar is the last leg.

1246
01:51:46,616 --> 01:51:49,578
He planned to kill Shankar
and break the chain.

1247
01:51:50,616 --> 01:51:53,173
Exept personal revenge
Shankar doesn't know

1248
01:51:53,253 --> 01:51:54,969
anything about this background game.

1249
01:51:55,049 --> 01:51:56,884
It's just like
any other paid contract killer.

1250
01:51:57,455 --> 01:51:59,975
The real culprit here is Rammoorthy.

1251
01:52:00,055 --> 01:52:01,273
And we need to catch him.

1252
01:52:01,353 --> 01:52:04,477
He is CM's uncle. It's not so easy.

1253
01:52:04,557 --> 01:52:08,108
CM went to Varanasi,
for the naming ceremony of his son.

1254
01:52:08,188 --> 01:52:11,247
Rammoorthy is also there.
We can easily catch him there, sir.

1255
01:52:11,596 --> 01:52:13,766
I have a solid plan, sir.
Trust me on this one.

1256
01:52:18,342 --> 01:52:21,123
Shankar will not come again, right?
- He will not come, sir.

1257
01:52:21,455 --> 01:52:23,337
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1258
01:52:23,417 --> 01:52:24,490
How?

1259
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:29,293
Sir. Devender has swearing ceremony
in three days.

1260
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:31,959
If Rammoorthy becomes Home Minister

1261
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:35,118
then we can't do anything.
This is the right time, sir.

1262
01:52:37,763 --> 01:52:41,562
[religious chants continue]

1263
01:52:58,708 --> 01:53:01,023
Arun, talk like Shankar.

1264
01:53:01,103 --> 01:53:02,466
They should not get any doubt.

1265
01:53:07,434 --> 01:53:08,628
Yes, Dharam, tell me.

1266
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:11,077
It's not Dharam, it's hot.

1267
01:53:11,497 --> 01:53:13,583
Who?
- Shankar.

1268
01:53:13,998 --> 01:53:16,250
Did you think,
I will die if you plan to kil me?

1269
01:53:16,445 --> 01:53:18,700
I have all the proofs.

1270
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:21,579
I need money.
- I am not in the city.

1271
01:53:21,659 --> 01:53:23,548
I will meet you once I am back.
- Hey, you.

1272
01:53:23,907 --> 01:53:26,418
With the intention
of not troubling you, I came here.

1273
01:53:27,278 --> 01:53:29,613
Not up, look back.

1274
01:53:50,118 --> 01:53:51,055
Me.

1275
01:53:52,317 --> 01:53:56,251
Uncle! Jamaal! Hawala Prakash!

1276
01:53:57,244 --> 01:53:59,551
Dharam! You!

1277
01:54:00,673 --> 01:54:01,824
This is the movie.

1278
01:54:03,663 --> 01:54:05,119
How much do you want?

1279
01:54:05,707 --> 01:54:08,611
Ten billion!
- Ten billion?

1280
01:54:10,601 --> 01:54:12,011
See!

1281
01:54:12,091 --> 01:54:13,601
If the murder was planned by you

1282
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:15,138
I would have asked you
only a 1 billion.

1283
01:54:17,761 --> 01:54:21,098
But it was CM, right?
Should I ask ten billion or not?

1284
01:54:24,464 --> 01:54:25,643
What is the proof?

1285
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:28,826
'Hey Dharam.
- Sir!'

1286
01:54:29,283 --> 01:54:30,470
'Hey!
- Sir!'

1287
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:32,481
'I don't know what you will do.'

1288
01:54:32,561 --> 01:54:34,531
'I can't allow Shankar
to stay alive.'

1289
01:54:36,275 --> 01:54:38,418
'Kasi Viswanadh's murder
shouldn't come out.'

1290
01:54:38,498 --> 01:54:41,114
'My dear one is going to be
the next CM with this sympathy.'

1291
01:54:41,483 --> 01:54:43,035
'If the news that Shankar
is still alive comes out'

1292
01:54:43,115 --> 01:54:45,122
'then the CM will kill us both.'

1293
01:54:46,181 --> 01:54:47,365
'Did you understand?'

1294
01:54:48,083 --> 01:54:49,540
This is Dharam's phone.

1295
01:54:50,058 --> 01:54:51,806
He kept it in auto call recording.

1296
01:54:52,324 --> 01:54:53,440
Not just this.

1297
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,351
All your conversations are in this.

1298
01:54:58,364 --> 01:55:01,532
Go and tell him
that his enemy is here.

1299
01:55:24,016 --> 01:55:27,020
Shankar! You are dead now.

1300
01:55:28,373 --> 01:55:31,585
Stop. Let me talk to him.

1301
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:39,240
What is it?

1302
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:41,153
When a tall man beats a short man

1303
01:55:41,233 --> 01:55:43,314
that tall man is beaten by Pochamma,
it seems.

1304
01:55:43,394 --> 01:55:46,794
If I am interrupted,
I will not leave even Pochama.

1305
01:55:46,874 --> 01:55:48,869
That's why you killed your father.

1306
01:55:48,949 --> 01:55:50,862
You became CM, gave birth to a son

1307
01:55:50,942 --> 01:55:53,117
for your father not to feel bad,
you gave his name to your son.

1308
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,657
I killed my own father for the seat.

1309
01:55:57,836 --> 01:55:59,331
What are you?

1310
01:55:59,967 --> 01:56:01,901
Are you giving me warning?

1311
01:56:02,806 --> 01:56:04,840
I am CM.

1312
01:56:05,289 --> 01:56:06,668
One person left after shouting a lot

1313
01:56:06,748 --> 01:56:08,513
and the other one
who cooked also left.

1314
01:56:08,593 --> 01:56:11,394
See, nothing is permanent here.

1315
01:56:11,474 --> 01:56:14,109
What if you are CM or PM?

1316
01:56:14,189 --> 01:56:16,384
Will you give me money or not?

1317
01:56:17,863 --> 01:56:19,109
On first note, will you go out?

1318
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:20,815
I will go very relaxedly.

1319
01:56:20,895 --> 01:56:22,655
Do you think I am a fool?

1320
01:56:22,735 --> 01:56:23,990
I kept uncle outside.

1321
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:26,568
Gun in the pocket
and camera on my body.

1322
01:56:26,648 --> 01:56:28,198
What else do you want?

1323
01:56:30,047 --> 01:56:31,458
Is it recording?

1324
01:56:32,047 --> 01:56:33,298
Is it recording?

1325
01:56:33,378 --> 01:56:35,567
It is. I already told you.
- Show me.

1326
01:56:35,647 --> 01:56:37,492
There is audio, video

1327
01:56:37,572 --> 01:56:39,494
and whatever you said
is also in the video.

1328
01:56:42,695 --> 01:56:45,594
Hwy, how many are there? How many?

1329
01:56:45,674 --> 01:56:47,081
How much each of you want?
- Madam!

1330
01:56:47,161 --> 01:56:49,213
Uncle, ask them how much they need.

1331
01:56:49,695 --> 01:56:51,980
He asked so much.
- Whatever he asked for.

1332
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:53,351
Just settle it with him.

1333
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:56,454
Hey, when the murderer of your
father is standing in front of you

1334
01:56:56,534 --> 01:56:59,189
what settlement without killing him?

1335
01:56:59,269 --> 01:57:02,031
Mother, we all together killed

1336
01:57:02,111 --> 01:57:03,433
your husband.

1337
01:57:03,513 --> 01:57:04,899
Is it to be settled or not?

1338
01:57:04,979 --> 01:57:06,989
Hey, what did you do?

1339
01:57:07,069 --> 01:57:08,221
What did you do to my husband?

1340
01:57:08,301 --> 01:57:09,819
What did you do to your father?
- Mother...

1341
01:57:09,899 --> 01:57:11,278
Sister...
- Tell me.

1342
01:57:11,358 --> 01:57:14,828
For giving you birth,
you killed your own father?

1343
01:57:14,908 --> 01:57:16,743
Mother, please be quiet.
- Get lost!

1344
01:57:17,355 --> 01:57:18,552
Hey!
- Sister...

1345
01:57:18,632 --> 01:57:20,157
In spite of being my own brother
- Mother, mother...

1346
01:57:20,237 --> 01:57:22,045
you kill my husband?
- Mother, mother...

1347
01:57:22,125 --> 01:57:24,298
Hey, are you humans?
- Mother, mother...

1348
01:57:24,378 --> 01:57:25,838
You are sinners.
- Mother, mother...

1349
01:57:25,918 --> 01:57:27,501
Oh, no.
- Mother, mother...

1350
01:57:27,581 --> 01:57:28,539
Oh, no.

1351
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:31,231
You are bad, born from my womb.
- Please...

1352
01:57:31,311 --> 01:57:32,721
Hey, Shankar.

1353
01:57:33,131 --> 01:57:34,744
If what you said is true.

1354
01:57:35,045 --> 01:57:36,597
Kill him also.

1355
01:57:36,677 --> 01:57:38,092
There is no need to kill him,
mother.

1356
01:57:38,417 --> 01:57:40,973
All this is being telecasted live
in all the channels.

1357
01:57:41,053 --> 01:57:43,883
Mr. Devender, it's over.

1358
01:57:44,415 --> 01:57:46,568
Better surrender. This is Arun, CBI.

1359
01:57:46,983 --> 01:57:47,927
Kill him.

1360
01:57:59,765 --> 01:58:02,172
Hey, this is CBI. Arrest them.

1361
01:58:06,568 --> 01:58:08,919
Get back! Get back! Come on.

1362
01:58:09,597 --> 01:58:12,722
Deva, I don't know whether it is
recorded or not.

1363
01:58:12,802 --> 01:58:14,992
I can't trust these CBI guys.

1364
01:58:15,072 --> 01:58:16,636
Not even government security.

1365
01:58:16,716 --> 01:58:18,952
Just take our people
and go away from here.

1366
01:58:19,032 --> 01:58:20,111
Go away.

1367
01:58:20,414 --> 01:58:21,809
Come.

1368
01:58:31,299 --> 01:58:33,397
Hey, do you know who I am?
You can't arrest me.

1369
01:58:33,477 --> 01:58:35,512
We have proof. We have orders.
- Who are you trying to follow?

1370
01:58:52,447 --> 01:58:53,458
Go, go...

1371
01:58:54,798 --> 01:58:56,067
Jump. Fast.

[relgious chants continue]

1373
01:59:22,501 --> 01:59:24,552
You are trying to take away my seat?

1374
01:59:26,452 --> 01:59:28,017
Get up.

1375
01:59:30,296 --> 01:59:31,666
Beat him!

1376
01:59:54,274 --> 01:59:56,247
No.

01:59:58,924 --> 02:00:02,743
"Everyone is Lord Shiva."

1378
02:00:07,282 --> 02:00:13,340
"Everyone is Lord Shiva."
- 'Shankara.'

Where am I?

1384
02:01:13,887 --> 02:01:17,398
What's going on here?
- Shankar?

1385
02:01:17,478 --> 02:01:21,024
Hey, who beat me, man?

1386
02:01:21,104 --> 02:01:24,302
Why are you beating me?
- Shankar.

1387
02:01:24,382 --> 02:01:25,842
Don't leave him.

1388
02:01:25,922 --> 02:01:28,340
He is the reason
for your Chandini's death.

1389
02:01:31,476 --> 02:01:33,975
Are you my villain?
- Yes. You idiot.

1390
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:36,958
I am the villain.

1391
02:01:41,796 --> 02:01:43,242
Hey!
It's been very long.

1392
02:01:43,322 --> 02:01:46,883
I promised in Peddamma temple.
It's been very long.

1393
02:01:46,963 --> 02:01:50,075
I promised on mother
that you are my hunt.

1394
02:01:50,155 --> 02:01:53,201
You are my ram.

Today is Feb 14th.

1420
02:06:38,138 --> 02:06:39,201
Do you remember

1421
02:06:39,738 --> 02:06:41,229
I told you
that I will marry you today.

1422
02:06:41,698 --> 02:06:44,266
'Feb 14th is our marriage.'

1423
02:06:45,014 --> 02:06:46,241
Yes.

1424
02:06:47,050 --> 02:06:48,467
Sarah, I know I am your soulmate.

1425
02:06:48,978 --> 02:06:50,373
But body is not mine.

1426
02:06:50,747 --> 02:06:52,807
Are you still ready to marry me?
- I am ready.

1427
02:06:52,887 --> 02:06:54,708
But I have only one problem.

1428
02:06:55,496 --> 02:06:57,583
Arun,
I can't trust your Hipo Compass.

1429
02:06:57,663 --> 02:07:00,088
Shankar memories are still in you.

1430
02:07:00,168 --> 02:07:01,993
They are not deleted so easily.

1431
02:07:02,073 --> 02:07:04,641
After marriage,
what if Shankar comes?

1432
02:07:04,721 --> 02:07:05,936
What about me?

1433
02:07:06,016 --> 02:07:09,298
Keep quiet. Don't spoil your mind.

1434
02:07:09,671 --> 02:07:11,508
Life is not in our hands.

1435
02:07:11,588 --> 02:07:13,306
Whatever has been decided
will happen.

1436
02:07:13,386 --> 02:07:15,482
Remember one thing.

1437
02:07:15,888 --> 02:07:18,938
Kill him and stop worries.

1438
02:07:19,018 --> 02:07:20,421
Hey, what are you saying?

1439
02:07:21,961 --> 02:07:23,600
Did you think Shankar is back?

1440
02:07:24,441 --> 02:07:25,930
I got frightened. Do you know that?

1441
02:07:26,609 --> 02:07:29,271
No.
But seriously, will you marry me?

1442
02:07:29,778 --> 02:07:30,829
Yes.

1443
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:53,249
Hey, doll!

1444
02:09:53,985 --> 02:09:54,985
If you say yes

1445
02:09:55,065 --> 02:09:57,512
I'll repair Golconda fort
and keep it in your hands.

1446
02:09:57,592 --> 02:10:00,505
I will make you queen
and let you sit in the palace.

1447
02:10:01,459 --> 02:10:03,502
What do you say?

1448
02:10:10,538 --> 02:10:11,809
Get lost, idiot.

1449
02:10:11,889 --> 02:10:13,820
I have seen
a lot of guys like you.
