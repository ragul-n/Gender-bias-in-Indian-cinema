1
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,370
"Beloved."

2
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:46,330
"Come, my beloved."

3
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:10,620
"Believe me, my beloved."

4
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,410
"Believe me, my beloved."

5
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:23,910
"Believe me, my beloved."

6
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,700
"Now believe me, my beloved."

7
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:52,080
"It's my wish."

8
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,000
"It's my wish."

9
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:12,790
"It's my wish."

10
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,250
"Believe me..."

11
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,000
"Now believe me, my beloved."

12
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:33,450
"Beloved..."

13
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,750
"Beloved."

14
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,200
"Beloved."

15
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,330
"Believe me, my beloved."

16
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,700
'When objects are near,
they often appear blurred.'

17
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,790
'When they are distant,
you can see them clearly.'

18
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,040
'But if they are too far away...'

19
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,750
'...you are unable to see them.'

20
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,250
'This is how mornings
usually begin in Batra house.'

21
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,290
'Especially for my wife Kiran.'

22
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,410
'Kiran!'

23
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,160
'An upper-class wife
of this middle-class family.'

24
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,830
'Although we weren't qualified
as equals by some standards...'

25
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,410
'...but her grandma liked the boy.'

26
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
'Meaning me.'

27
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,580
'And why wouldn't they?'

28
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,660
'After all it's not easy
to find decent guys...'

29
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,040
'Although it's not a typical love marriage,
but there was some love to be found...'

30
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,290
'Albeit a little.'

31
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,750
Preeti.

32
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,910
Preeti!

33
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,620
'Preeti. Preeti. Preeti.'

34
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,750
'Preeti is full of life...'

35
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,200
'She looks like a foreigner...'

36
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,790
'...her values are completely
"Desi... Indian."

37
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,290
'Banarasi.'

38
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,870
Hey!... I will kick
the ass out of you... You!

39
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,500
She is abusing me.

40
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,000
Take it, it's worth it.

41
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,450
I'll slap you.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,290
'With this beautiful
song your friend SR...'

43
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,200
'...Santosh Rao bids you farewell.'

44
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,950
'See you tomorrow with
your favorite songs.'

45
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,160
'Till then keep listening
to FM Rainbow, India...'

46
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,290
'This is me.'

47
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,040
'Yashwant Batra.'

48
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,910
'The Hero of this story,
who is still sleeping...'

49
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,370
'...unaware that exactly
after two months Preeti & Kiran...'

50
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,410
'...won't be there for me.'

51
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,660
'You don't believe me, do you?'

52
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,290
'Because everything seems normal.'

53
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,830
'At home.'

54
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,750
'And outside.'

55
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Okay. Tell me.
Why didn't you sleep last night?

56
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Father did not name me
Jugnu (Firefly) just like that.

57
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,660
I see.

58
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,290
Okay. Listen.

59
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,540
Do you know?

60
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,580
Why do stars twinkle
the whole night?

61
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,620
Why?

62
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,330
Because you like it.

63
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,370
You know why thunderous
clouds shower?

64
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,290
Why?

65
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,750
Because you like it.

66
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,330
Okay. Now you listen.

67
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,750
If papa finds out that
I am on the phone with you...

68
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,500
...then watching you getting beat-up
would be a fun treat!

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Is that so?

70
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,250
Did it hurt, right?

71
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,620
It hurts.

72
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,750
A little.

73
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,250
What are you doing?

74
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:54,330
Prince Salim presents this
fresh cauliflower to his love.

75
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,950
Cauliflower?

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,250
It's my favorite.

77
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,870
Mine too.

78
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,870
Would you like to eat beans
and rice for dinner?

79
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,830
Cook whatever you want.

80
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,750
You have been wearing
the same shirt for a week.

81
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,830
That too inside-out.
Wear this one.

82
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,330
Why don't you shave off your
moustache. It would look nice.

83
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,790
If my office people like it,
what can I do?

84
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,160
Is my lunch box ready?

85
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,870
It's ready.

86
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,330
Where is Preeti? Preeti!

87
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,950
- I will cook it for you.
- Jugnu, papa is coming. Go.

88
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,910
Don't worry, I will talk to him.

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,750
- If he comes, Don't worry, I will talk to him.
- Please go.

90
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,870
She is ready.
She is waiting outside for you.

91
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,290
Besides you everybody
in the house gets ready on time.

92
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,500
Bring the lunch box down.

93
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,700
Preeti.

94
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,290
Jugnu, papa is coming. Go.

95
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,120
What's going on!

96
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,250
What the hell is happening here!

97
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,950
What are you doing here?

98
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,200
Uncle...

99
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,370
- I..I was just flying a kite.
- Just sitting here?

100
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,790
Yes, uncle. It got torn.
I came running to catch it.

101
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,790
Did you buy this cauliflower?

102
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,370
No, uncle.

103
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,870
Actually... I just came for the kite.

104
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,870
On the way I saw this.fresh cauliflower.
So I bought it. Do you want it?

105
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,330
I see that all your kites
fall here these days.

106
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,950
You... get back inside.

107
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
Papa, I have to go to college.
It's getting late.

108
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,120
That's why I have been waiting
for you...

109
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,290
Where are you!

110
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,160
Coming. Two minutes.
It takes time.

111
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,790
How much time?

112
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,410
If not a new scooter,
you can at least change the helmet.

113
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
- What is the problem with this?
- See its condition.

114
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,120
It's tough. ICICI mark.

115
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,910
- ISI mark.
- Yes. I know.

116
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,250
Is there Bati (light) at home?

117
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,580
Uncle, there is no power
from last night.

118
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,910
We had to use the generator.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,330
If you don't have it,
shall I get it installed?

120
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,540
I am asking for
your father Batti, son.

121
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,410
- He...
- Where is he?

122
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,200
Uncle, these days he is into fitness.
So he is running.

123
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,870
Great! Son is flying kites.
Father is working out.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,290
You all are turning this entire street
into a useless playground.

125
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,370
- Good morning.
- Papa.

126
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,250
I was asking for you.

127
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,200
He said you were missing
Since last night.

128
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,620
Wonder in whose house you would be.

129
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,910
How can he be sure about me
when even he is unaware of himself...

130
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,790
It was his mother that used to...

131
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,540
- Right, sister-in-law?
- Sister-in-law.

132
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,410
Absolutely.

133
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,080
Look, I am telling you.

134
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,080
Do it every day for
one to one and a half hours.

135
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,120
Look.

136
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,790
Look at these amazing shoes.
Where did you get it

137
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,450
- Shoes?
- Really nice.

138
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,750
- You like this?
- I really like it.

139
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,750
Literally. Very good.

140
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,370
- Jugnu.
- Yes, papa.

141
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,370
- Bring my slippers.
- Slippers?

142
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,000
- Kolhapuri.
- What are you doing?

143
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,200
From today it's yours.

144
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,910
- Here.
- Why? No. I mean...

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,660
No. No.

146
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,000
It's my principle.
Anyone who likes something...

147
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,540
I just give it as a gift.

148
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,000
No. How will you do it barefoot?

149
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,540
- Please.
- Papa, barefoot?

150
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,700
Wear slippers, papa.

151
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,290
- Keep my shoes carefully.
- Shoes will tear.

152
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,750
He gave it to you.
What are you doing? It's dirty.

153
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,870
- It's new.
- How come it's new?

154
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,910
He was wearing it and running.
Leave it.

155
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,290
Leave it!

156
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,580
- Keep it. It will come in handy.
- Now leave.

157
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,830
- Wrap it and keep.
- Bye, mama.

158
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,120
Bye, dear.

159
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,120
It's really wrong.
Very wrong.

160
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,870
I don't like all this.

161
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,410
- Papa...
- Not a word! Come on. Sit.

162
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,290
I have been ready,
waiting for you papa...

163
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,290
Ready my foot.

164
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,080
Sit!

165
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,790
Someone is selling cauliflower.
Someone is flying kites.

166
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,330
Someone is running.

167
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,290
Papa, slowly.

168
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,000
Return on your own.

169
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,160
Mr. Shukla,
when will Mr. Batra come?

170
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,790
He himself does not
know when he will come.

171
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,370
You are asking me.

172
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,450
He has come.
Mr. Batra, hello.

173
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,290
Hello, Mr. Shukla.
How are you?

174
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,290
Fine.

175
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,410
- Did you guys party yesterday?
- What party? All nonsense.

176
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,830
What is this, sir?

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,830
The post office works for four hours.

178
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,450
And you are an hour late.

179
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,410
You have to come once a year
to collect your father's pension.

180
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,580
I have to come every day.
You saw the traffic, didn't you?

181
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,160
I also come by traffic every day, sir.

182
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,830
So from tomorrow give
me also a lift, okay!

183
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,000
When will you give it?

184
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,910
Sir, it slipped my mind.

185
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,040
- So let it be like that?
- Mr. Batra.

186
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,330
The boss was asking for you.

187
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,950
What else does he do?
Always asking for me.

188
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,950
Did he say to come now?

189
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,160
Yes. He said to send
you as soon as you come.

190
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,330
Write the date.

191
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,080
He does not even let me drink tea.

192
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,500
I will retire after four years.

193
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Listen. Order tea.
We will have it together.

194
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,120
- I will come in five minutes.
- Sir, this is done.

195
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,290
Sign it. I am coming.

196
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,790
Brother, give me a bottle of whisky.

197
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,080
Shyam, pass me a half pint!
Half pint!

198
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
At least remove your crown.

199
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,580
Here. Hold it.

200
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,370
What have you brought?

201
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,000
Chicken.

202
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
I asked you before about
cooking rice & beans today...

203
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,200
...and again, you brought chicken.

204
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,450
We will eat kidney
beans and rice tomorrow.

205
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,540
Cook this.

206
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,620
Tomorrow is full moon.
And that's it...

207
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,330
- Preeti.
- Yes.

208
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,950
Listen, dear. Dear, take this.
Your papa got it.

209
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,370
Go and keep it in the kitchen.

210
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,950
What have you brought, papa?

211
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,290
I bought chicken by mistake.

212
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,540
You brought chicken.
You brought chicken. Chicken!

213
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,120
Careful.

214
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,000
- Yes.
- You have a life Papa!

215
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,410
Come on!

216
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,750
- Did she return from college on time?
- Yes, she did.

217
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,120
Remove this ladder.

218
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,830
Why don't you keep
the house tidy & clean.

219
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,660
Why? Everything is fine.

220
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,290
Mr. Bedi will be coming in
in a day or two.

221
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,410
Why?

222
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,040
To see the girl.

223
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,200
Whose girl?

224
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,700
Whose girl will he be seeing?

225
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,040
If he is coming to our house,
he will come to see our girl.

226
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,580
He won't come here
to see the neighbor's girl.

227
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,290
Asking stupid questions.

228
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,120
I met his son. He is good.

229
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,870
He has a government job.
He is the only child.

230
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,370
He'll treat Preeti like a queen.
I already said "yes" on our behalf.

231
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,290
- Papa, you said yes.
- Yes, dear.

232
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,160
You didn't even ask me, papa.

233
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,450
- I don't want to get married now.
- When will you get married?

234
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,700
When there won't be any boys left.

235
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,660
Mama, tell him my age.

236
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,450
Age?

237
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,540
At your age your mother
had become your mother.

238
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,200
Do you understand?

239
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,370
Look, it was different back then.

240
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,250
Her college will soon get over.

241
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,500
She might want to
opt for higher studies.

242
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,250
You should have at least
asked her once.

243
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,290
- I mean...
- Did anyone ask us?

244
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,330
We have been living
together for 24 years.

245
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,910
She handles the house.
I go to the office.

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,410
This is called marriage.
We get on with it fine!

247
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,040
You will also have to do it. Right?

248
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,040
Come on now, Smile.

249
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,330
Smile.

250
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,120
Preeti.

251
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,790
- Preeti.
- Papa, I don't want to get married.

252
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,040
Everyone does as they please.
Marriage. Marriage.

253
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,660
- It's entirely your fault.
- What do you mean?

254
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,370
What else?

255
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,080
Understand and handle it.

256
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,700
I don't want to hear anything
like this in this house.

257
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,910
I don't like this.

258
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,250
You work the whole day.

259
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,870
Then come home to
hear all this nonsense...

260
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,000
Will you give me my loincloth?

261
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,950
What is your problem?

262
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,250
My problem is the problem of
every father who has a daughter.

263
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,120
Today's children elope
and get married.

264
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,200
You have to blame stupid parents.

265
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,540
What is the problem?
I am doing everything right.

266
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,000
I am providing education, good food.

267
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,000
I can think what's
good or bad for her.

268
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,910
I am the best person.

269
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,200
Then?

270
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,450
You can give your speech
when she runs away from home.

271
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,950
How will she elope?

272
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,160
I have provided food.

273
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,660
I work had all day for you two.
How can she elope?

274
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,790
Preeti.

275
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,000
Preeti.

276
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,830
Come here, dear.

277
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,410
Tell your mother.

278
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,950
Tell her today

279
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,870
You won't run and get married. Right?

280
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,620
You won't marry without my permission.
Tell your mother.

281
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,660
Preeti.

282
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,120
Speak up.

283
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,160
Do you see that?

284
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,330
All because of
your spoiled love.

285
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,330
You should be doing
this instead of me...

286
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,620
And I am the one doing it for you.

287
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,830
Is there ice in the fridge ?

288
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,540
Don't I do it everyday?

289
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,870
So what's the big deal you
should do it everyday

290
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,950
Is anyone going ask me a glass
of water in this house? Cold water.

291
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,120
Can I get a bottle?

292
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,000
Always high temper right after office

293
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,370
Use onion paste for chicken.

294
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,330
Do you want something?

295
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,160
No.

296
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,580
What are you thinking?

297
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,830
That how it be after Preeti is gone...

298
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,750
Will you be able
to live without Preeti?

299
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,250
Mr. Bedi was saying he just wants
my daughter draped in a single sari.

300
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,580
We will manage.

301
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,120
Whether he demands
anything or not...

302
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,370
But... marriage has
many expenses.

303
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,790
After all it's marriage...
I am really worried.

304
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,700
Is everything okay?

305
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,450
Okay...

306
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,250
Preeti...

307
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,120
Preeti...

308
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,450
What happen?

309
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,330
Papa has fix my marriage
with Bedi uncle's son.

310
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,450
Now he will not agree.
We are done.

311
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,700
Listen. If you want,
I can talk to Ravi?

312
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,700
After all, he is her uncle.

313
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,910
He will gladly do everything.

314
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,290
And mother has also kept
many things aside for Preeti.

315
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,330
I will sell the house.

316
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,450
I will get her married in a temple.

317
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,950
But I won't take anything
from your family.

318
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,160
Shall we go?

319
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,120
What happened?

320
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,580
Jugnu, are we making a mistake?

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,120
What do you mean?

322
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,580
We are getting married
without informing our parents.

323
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,410
Are we doing the right thing?

324
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,040
Preeti, what do we do?

325
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,000
Wait for Keshav to come and marry you.

326
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,620
And I should do nothing.

327
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,410
Preeti, we are not
eloping and getting married.

328
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,290
We are just getting married
without telling anyone.

329
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,660
And everything remains the same way...

330
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,410
You will be in your house
and I will be in my house.

331
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,910
And when the time is right...

332
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,330
we will tell everyone.

333
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,160
And anyway,
our homes are not too far.

334
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,160
You know I can hear you breathe...

335
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,200
Shall we get married now?

336
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,870
"My eyes. Your eyes in my eyes."

337
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,040
"Breaths are fragrant.
Your breaths in my breaths."

338
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,750
"Your breaths. Your breaths."

339
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,040
"My eyes. Your eyes in my eyes."

340
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,500
"Breaths are fragrant.
Your breaths in my breaths."

341
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,250
"Oh yes."

342
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,040
"The season is mesmerizing."

343
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,370
"It's your magic."

344
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,950
"There is a little trance."

345
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,290
"My eyes. Your eyes in my eyes."

346
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,250
- Jugnu
- Hi.

347
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,200
- Come up quickly.
- Tell me.

348
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,120
There is no one.

349
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,750
You're looking nice.

350
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,370
- What?
- Quiet.

351
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,500
- What?
- Who is it?

352
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,410
What's going on?

353
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,290
- What's going on here?
- Papa, the stuff ...

354
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,750
I was keeping the computer inside.

355
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,040
Looking that way,
and going this way.

356
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,500
If you drop it, or breaks, do you know
how expensive these things are.

357
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,950
How much, papa?

358
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,700
Oh daughter.

359
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,660
How are you?

360
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,410
I am fine.

361
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,790
- Where is papa?
- He's downstairs.

362
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,660
- And mummy?
- She's at home?

363
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,830
With papa?

364
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,410
What were you doing upstairs?

365
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,910
No uncle, clothes.

366
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I see.

367
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,370
Give her some brains too.

368
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,870
Just a little.

369
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,540
I promised her mother that
I will look after her.

370
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,450
But this...

371
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,950
Uncle, your bag is really nice.

372
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,950
Bag?

373
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,200
- You liked this.
- Yes.

374
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,160
- You like it.
- Yes, uncle.

375
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,370
Just a sec.

376
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,370
Here, go give it to Preeti.

377
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,620
- Come quickly.
- Not again.

378
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:13,000
"I am always dreaming about you."

379
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:21,790
"I spend my days thinking about you."

380
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:30,410
"I seek solace in your arms."

381
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,160
"Come here... let's hug."

382
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,290
"You make my heart dance to your tunes."

383
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,330
"Love is in the air."

384
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,660
"Oh yes."

385
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,160
"Everything around me
seems positive..."

386
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,660
"...and that's only because of you.

387
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,660
"You have become the center
of my universe."

388
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,370
"My eyes. Your eyes in my eyes."

389
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,540
"Breaths are fragrant.
Your breaths in my breaths."

390
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,660
"Your breaths..."

391
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,750
"Your breaths..."

392
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,830
"Your breaths..."

393
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,830
"Your breaths..."

394
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,500
"Your breaths..."

395
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,370
Did the newspaper guy show up?

396
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,540
Yes. I have paid him.

397
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,250
Listen. Tomorrow is
Ravi's wedding anniversary.

398
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,000
He has thrown a party.
All of us have to go.

399
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,450
It's again...
brother-in-law's anniversary.

400
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,790
You go alone.

401
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,700
Will it look good if I go alone?

402
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,040
He wants you to come alone.

403
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,750
That's why he did not call me up.

404
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,370
He did call me.

405
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,660
What difference does it
make whether he calls you or me?

406
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,950
It does makes a difference.
You go by yourself.

407
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,250
I don't like all these things.

408
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,000
Go alone.

409
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,000
We never celebrate!

410
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,250
We can at least participate
in other's happiness.

411
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,790
As it is, you have a problem
not with the marriage anniversary...

412
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,540
It's about going to my house.

413
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,870
Yes. You know.

414
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,870
Where did you keep
the screwdriver, Preeti?

415
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,500
It's always a struggle finding
things in this house.

416
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,450
Nobody is there to pay attention.

417
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,700
Only running around

418
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,080
What's all this?
Move it from here.

419
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,790
What has my family done?

420
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,160
Don't they respect you!

421
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,700
Come on.
Whenever we're supposed to go there...

422
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,580
- ...you make some excuse.
- Here is your screwdriver.

423
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,330
Now, why you need to open this?

424
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,660
When it's Sunday...
it means something gets open up.

425
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,000
What is this?

426
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,500
Mama, you went shopping.

427
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,700
- Yes, dear...
- Why didn't you take me?

428
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,750
- Sorry.
- You don't even tell me.

429
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,910
For whom is this?

430
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,870
- For you. Who else?
- Thank you.

431
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,290
It's really nice.
What else have you got?

432
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,790
Who did you go with?

433
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,830
With aunt Kamla, dear.

434
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,450
For whom is this t-shirt?

435
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,830
I don't wear it.
I have got it for your papa.

436
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,790
Papa, see this.

437
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,830
- What is it?
- Leave that. See this.

438
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,750
- T-shirt.
- For whom it is.

439
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,410
Yours. Who else?

440
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,450
What was the need for this?

441
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,040
Marriage on our heads
& you guys just splurge money.

442
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,870
Splurge everything.

443
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,790
I would have to sell my blood
looks like to get her married.

444
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,700
Going for shopping.

445
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,290
Put it in the packet, dear.
I will return it tomorrow.

446
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,830
Mama. Mama, listen.

447
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,040
Keep quiet. Don't tell her.

448
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,000
So shall I tell you?

449
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,750
Papa, what is this?

450
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,450
Is it too much to wear this T-shirt ?

451
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,330
I don't want to wear it.
I don't want to wear it.

452
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,120
Is that so?
Haven't you worn t-shirt before?

453
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,080
What's the harm in
wearing another one.

454
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,330
Papa, please don't do that.

455
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,120
- You...
- Please, papa. Wear it.

456
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,290
Please.

457
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,450
Go. Go.

458
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,660
Go.

459
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,000
How does it look?

460
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,080
It's okay.

461
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,250
Isn't it long?

462
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,120
No.

463
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,910
No. Preeti was saying
it's a little long.

464
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,160
You are looking nice.
You are looking young.

465
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,200
How much is it for?

466
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,200
After discount Rs.299.

467
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,500
After all this!

468
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,160
It's cheap.

469
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,200
You should have bought a few more.

470
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,160
It's good to wear at home.

471
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,750
Is there any letter for Firoz Khan?

472
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,160
No. There is no letter for Firoz Khan.

473
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,120
Tell me something. Shall I see my
family or business or come here daily?

474
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,330
What can I do?

475
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,410
Go and meet Mr. Shukla.

476
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,450
- Where is Mr. Shukla?
- Inside.

477
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,370
It's been a month.
It's the same thing every day.

478
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,660
Mr. Shukla, I was expecting a letter.

479
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,450
I was expecting a letter.

480
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,870
- My name is Firoz.
- I see.

481
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,160
- Come tomorrow.
- I won't come tomorrow.

482
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,660
For the past one month
that man at the window...

483
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,700
...has been telling
me to come tomorrow.

484
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,290
That's why I have come to you.

485
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,660
So better come tomorrow.

486
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,120
The letter is very important.
Listen to me.

487
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,290
Our work is very important for us.

488
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,950
At least listen to me. Past one month,
I have been running from pillar to post.

489
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,290
He is giving me a run around
and now you are saying...

490
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,700
...you have something
important to do.

491
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,200
I have to make one month's
report and submit it to my boss.

492
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,450
This work is very important.
Try to understand.

493
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,500
- Well...
- It's government work.

494
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,000
What's more important is to deliver
letters to people at the right time.

495
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,910
That is the responsibility
of this department.

496
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,000
I see. So now you will explain
my responsibility to me.

497
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,700
Yes. I will explain
your responsibility to you.

498
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,910
It's your responsibility that everybody
should get their letter on time.

499
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,750
It's not happening.
I have been struggling for a month.

500
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,950
Mr. Shukla. Mr. Shukla.

501
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,540
- Come here.
- Look, Mr. Batra.

502
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,330
He has come to explain
my responsibility to me.

503
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,200
It's okay. Sit. Leave it.

504
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,410
What happened? Tell me.

505
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,250
Sir, nothing. I have been
running around for a month.

506
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,620
The officer sitting at the window...

507
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,200
...says come tomorrow
or day after tomorrow.

508
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,200
I came to him.
He is also saying the same thing.

509
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,250
The hospital is saying
to first deposit money.

510
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,910
The insurance people are
saying they have sent the letter.

511
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,910
And he is saying
he has not received it.

512
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,910
Now tell me.
What should I do?

513
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,910
No. No. Don't do anything.
Just do one thing.

514
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,370
- Write the address here.
- Will you deliver it?

515
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,660
I will deliver it personally.
It's my responsibility.

516
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,330
Yes.

517
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,750
Okay, sir.

518
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,700
- Okay. You stay at Englishiya lane?
- Yes.

519
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,410
It's nearby. I will deliver it.

520
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,870
- Please. Take care.
- Okay. It's my responsibility.

521
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,830
- Bye.
- Okay, sir.

522
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,200
Listen. Here. From here.

523
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,250
Okay, sir.

524
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,410
Sir, please do the work.
It's very important.

525
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,500
It's very important.
It's the question of someone's life.

526
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,370
No. Since I have taken
the responsibility, I will deliver it.

527
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,000
Sir, if the letter
does not arrive on time...

528
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,160
Okay.

529
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,910
You should have also come.

530
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,370
Papa, tomorrow is the last
day of submitting my assignment.

531
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,250
It's always the case... that whenever
I need you, you are not there.

532
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,700
Like your grandpa.

533
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,250
Preeti. Dear, please come here.

534
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,750
Adjust this.

535
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,450
Do I look fine?

536
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,830
Did you recognize?
It's your favorite sari.

537
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,950
Come on now.
Don't try be some heroine.

538
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,750
Mama, you are looking beautiful.

539
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,910
Mama, seriously.
You are looking very beautiful.

540
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,910
- Are you listening?
- Coming.

541
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,450
Half liter petrol is
wasted while just waiting.

542
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,830
Close the door properly.

543
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,620
Bye.

544
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Dear, heat milk and drink it.
Don't forget.

545
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,250
- Okay, mama.
- Do everything here.

546
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,660
- Come on.
- Bye, Papa.

547
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,040
- Bye.
- Come on. We have to buy flowers too.

548
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,540
How are you trying to sit now!

549
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,500
Why?

550
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,080
Sit a little far.

551
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,910
If people see it, what will they say?

552
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,790
Bye, mama.

553
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,620
You go.

554
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,660
- You come too.
- I am coming. You go.

555
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,250
You people have made me a driver.

556
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,160
Oh sister.

557
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,450
- Congratulation
- Thanks.

558
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,200
Thank you so much. Sit, sit.

559
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,950
Mom...

560
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,000
Preeti.

561
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,250
Preeti.

562
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,750
Preeti.

563
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,540
What are you doing here?

564
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,370
Preeti, listen to me.

565
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,540
Look, I don't want to listen to anything.
Go away. Someone might see you.

566
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,410
Have you gone crazy?

567
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,250
No one will see. Listen to me.

568
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,620
I know why you have come.
Go away or else I will beat you.

569
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,040
I want to show you something.

570
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,500
What is it?

571
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,750
The key to my shop.

572
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,620
You know, tomorrow morning
at 10 o'clock sharp...

573
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,750
...the shop will be inaugurated
by your papa's sinful hands.

574
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,120
But do you know what my heart says?

575
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,160
My heart wishes that
the shop should be unlocked...

576
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,250
...by your hands first.

577
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,370
Please...

578
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,910
Did you see how are they
treating me... like some beggar.

579
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,790
Oh brother-in-law...

580
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,450
He was dancing really well.

581
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,660
It's...

582
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,120
When did you learn?

583
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,750
You guys are too much,
I saw it on TV...

584
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,000
I mean...

585
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,000
Sister was saying you
fixed Preeti's marriage.

586
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,410
I was thinking about it.

587
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,500
He's a nice guy.

588
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,330
Mehra sir.

589
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,040
What's new these days.

590
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:16,540
This is Mr. Mehra, my friend.
And he's a reknowned builder.

591
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,000
He's always praising me.

592
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:23,660
As you know, he booked all the hotels
in Delhi on his sister's wedding.

593
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,620
Oh I see.

594
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,200
And he is our brother-in-law.

595
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,200
I see.

596
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,250
Even his daughter is getting married.

597
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,120
I hope you will come Mr. Mehra.

598
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,700
Of course.

599
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,330
The daughter's wedding is
her father's biggest dream.

600
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,580
Millions of expenses.

601
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,580
What is your business?

602
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,250
Whose scooter is this?

603
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,660
Move it.

604
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,620
Come on.

605
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,200
- Get the scooter.
- Yes.

606
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,950
Move it.

607
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,410
Get it...get it.

608
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,040
- I am not drunk.
- Hurry up.

609
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,370
Leave it.

610
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,950
We're going.

611
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,830
Come. Come in.

612
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,910
Everybody is waiting.

613
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,540
Who?

614
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,080
Let's have food.

615
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,120
I am not hungry.

616
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,540
But I am hungry.

617
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,660
Preeti.

618
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,330
Preeti!

619
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,620
This is some way to nap!

620
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,250
Preeti!

621
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,750
Does it take so long to open the door?

622
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,700
- Papa, I had fallen asleep.
- You had fallen asleep.

623
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,910
How will you look after your house?

624
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,500
- What happened?
- Nothing.

625
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,500
Will someone hand me some water?

626
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,750
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

627
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,790
I am asking you something.
What are you doing?

628
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,580
I am searching for
the documents of the house.

629
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,250
What is this?
What is this?

630
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,120
Why are you making a mess? I
toil all day to keep the house clean.

631
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,290
What are you doing?

632
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,540
Stop it. What are you doing?

633
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,790
I will sell my house.

634
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,040
- What are you saying?
- Throw it away.

635
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
What is going on?

636
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,040
I will sell off this house.

637
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,870
I will show them how
a daughter's wedding is conducted.

638
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,290
To whom will you show?
To Ravi?

639
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,830
Yes, I will show to Ravi.

640
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,250
God knows what is
wrong with you?

641
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,790
You are doing all this
in the middle of the night.

642
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,330
Go and bring some water.

643
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,450
Listen, act sensibly.

644
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,160
Tell me... how can someone sell off
this ancestral house just like that?

645
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,790
1918.

646
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,500
I don't really want to sell
this house.

647
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,540
I lived in this house as a child.
All the walls are familiar with me.

648
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,620
This lane knows me.

649
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,040
I will sell it off.

650
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,250
I will sell it off for
my daughter's sake...

651
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,750
...and show it to people how
a wedding should be conducted.

652
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,450
What has happened?

653
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,830
Papa.

654
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,620
What papa? What?

655
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,830
If you want to sell
the house for my wedding...

656
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,200
...then, there's no need for that.

657
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,700
We do.

658
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,910
We have to.

659
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,040
You will...

660
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,450
...have a grand wedding.
Really grand.

661
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,250
Mama, I want to talk
to you about something.

662
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,330
Even I never thought that
she will do something like this.

663
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,250
Please be gentle with her.

664
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,790
She is very scared.

665
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,250
What is this?

666
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,910
Papa, I was going to tell you.

667
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,160
- What were you going to tell?
- What are you doing?

668
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,620
- Let go of me!
- What is going on?

669
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,700
Tell me that you ran off
and got married.

670
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,790
Didn't you trust us?
Were we dead?

671
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,870
You did trust us, didn't you?

672
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,040
- I did trust you, papa.
- Trust my foot!

673
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,830
You would have got me
married to anyone.

674
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,620
So? What difference
does it make?

675
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,410
Someone, whom neither you know nor me.
It does make a difference.

676
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,750
For you everything is your duty.

677
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,250
I, mummy, the house,
all are your duties.

678
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,870
Do you see she is
talking just like you?

679
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,830
No, papa, I am expressing
my thoughts.

680
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,790
My marriage is also is
just a duty for you.

681
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,250
And you fulfill all
your duties very well.

682
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,750
But you think
only about yourself.

683
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,410
Papa, you could not
understand mummy's feelings...

684
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,330
...in 24 years,
so how would you have understood mine?

685
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,000
Dear, you should not talk
to your papa in this manner.

686
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
Let her speak!

687
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,910
Yes, mummy, let me speak.

688
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,700
Please, let me say what
you could not say in 24 years.

689
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,580
Do you know what I remember
from all these years?

690
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,200
The fight between the two of you
and mummy's suffering in silence.

691
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,120
I don't want such a life.

692
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,330
I don't want to live like mummy.

693
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
That is why I married
the person I love.

694
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,250
What wrong have I done?

695
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,790
Papa, do you know he even takes
care of my smallest of needs.

696
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,700
What was I wearing and when?

697
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,660
When had I met him first?

698
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,250
Do you know all this?

699
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,000
Papa, do you even know
mummy's birthday?

700
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,450
Wouldn't you have found
someone just like you?

701
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:20,080
Papa, do you want me to live
all my life just like my mummy?

702
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,000
Papa, do you know how to love?

703
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,750
You neither know how to
love nor do you wish to do so.

704
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,290
Mummy, am I wrong?

705
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,250
It hurts me too.

706
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,500
I am her mother.

707
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,750
She didn't even tell me.

708
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:52,250
I agree that her approach was wrong,
but what she did is not wrong.

709
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,700
You are taking her side too.

710
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,790
I am not taking any sides.

711
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:07,160
Firstly, wrong parenting,
and on top of it arguments.

712
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,120
What else is this
if not supporting her?

713
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,290
What is it?

714
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,580
Tell me.

715
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,830
There is no point in talking to you.

716
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,160
Speak up.
You say something too.

717
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,200
I don't want to talk
to you in this regard.

718
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,620
Say it.

719
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,580
By talking I found out
that my daughter doesn't love me.

720
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,580
Now you too tell me
whether you love me or not.

721
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,330
What is the use of
explaining anything to you?

722
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,580
You think that you go to office and I
look after the house and that is love.

723
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,660
- What else is love?
- Is this love?

724
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,620
Yash, it is called responsibility.

725
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,000
It is called duty...

726
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,080
which you and I have been
carrying out for years.

727
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,660
You have no idea what love is.

728
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,080
Love is appreciating each
other and knowing each other.

729
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,000
Understanding each other.

730
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,870
Love is making efforts.

731
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,370
Making efforts to keep
each other happy.

732
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,910
You don't care about me.

733
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,580
You cannot appreciate me.

734
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,870
Do you remember when
you last sat with me like this?

735
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,870
When did you last sat with
me like this and talked to me?

736
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,080
You happen to be near me...

737
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,870
...but not with me.

738
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,500
You do not love me.

739
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,250
So why are you living with me?

740
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,750
Am I living with you?

741
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,950
You are.

742
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,540
Do I demand rent from you?

743
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,580
You are just living here.

744
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,790
God knows why...

745
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,830
I am not living with you.
I am just making compromises.

746
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,080
- Compromising...
- I am shouldering your responsibilities.

747
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,660
The responsibility of
your morning tea...

748
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,120
...the responsibility of your lunchbox
the responsibility of your clothes.

749
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,450
The responsibility of
the ice you ask for...

750
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,370
...along with your drink
in the evening.

751
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,950
Half of my life has passed
like this shouldering them.

752
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,040
The rest of it will also pass.

753
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,870
Good.

754
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:52,870
Very good.

755
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,700
You know what...

756
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,330
Just leave me.

757
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,450
I will take care of
this house and myself.

758
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,870
Leave me.

759
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,200
Do you realise what you are saying?

760
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,790
Yes, I know what I am saying.

761
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,000
Are you asking me to leave?

762
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,330
Yes, do me a favor by not
doing any more favors.

763
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,580
Please.

764
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,080
Go away.

765
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,580
Do you want me to leave?

766
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:30,080
I will leave.

767
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,620
I will leave after marrying
off my daughter.

768
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:37,540
First I will send her off
and then I will leave.

769
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:42,290
This is your house.
You can live here happily.

770
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,250
Alone. Without me.

771
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,950
I will leave happily.

772
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,540
Go to hell.

773
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,080
I will live alone.
I don't need anybody.

774
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,370
Then all of you go to hell

775
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:08,290
This is my house.
I will live alone in this house.

776
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,160
All of you go to hell.

777
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:17,290
"My friend,
apply henna to the bride's hands."

778
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:22,660
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

779
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:32,040
"In a gold bowl,
in a gold bowl, in a gold bowl..."

780
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,120
"...you have been
mixing it my friend."

781
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,250
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

782
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,620
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

783
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:03,750
"I wash the gold bowl
again and again."

784
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:08,870
"I wash the gold bowl
again and again."

785
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,580
"Apply henna to my hands."

786
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,790
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

787
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,040
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

788
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,660
Come, dear, give this to
uncle Gupta, okay?

789
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,370
I...I will drink here.

790
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,040
Keep it covered.

791
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,870
Papa, please eat something.

792
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,830
You haven't eaten
anything since morning.

793
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,040
Is it nice?

794
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,540
I made this... the way you like it.

795
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,580
Yes, it is nice.

796
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,580
I am just going across the street.

797
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,950
Won't you forgive me?

798
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,870
Sorry, papa.

799
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,330
Sorry.

800
00:52:54,910 --> 00:53:03,290
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

801
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:11,580
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

802
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:20,160
"My friend, since long you
have been mixing it in a gold bowl."

803
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:28,450
"My friend, since long you have been
mixing it in a gold bowl."

804
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:37,000
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

805
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:12,290
"Apply the henna in such a way..."

806
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:20,290
"Apply the henna in such a way..."

807
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:27,540
"...that it does not fade
after I go to my beloved's house."

808
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:43,200
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

809
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:51,950
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

810
00:54:52,040 --> 00:55:00,450
"My friend, since long you
have been mixing it in a gold bowl."

811
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:08,410
"My friend, since long you
have been mixing it in a gold bowl."

812
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:17,250
"My friend, apply henna to
the bride's hands."

813
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:30,450
'Didn't I tell you, that
exactly after 2 months from now...'

814
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,250
'...Preeti and Kiran,
both will go away from me.'

815
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,290
Mother, tell me one thing.

816
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,450
What did you see in that boy?

817
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,250
He has no good looks, no personality, no smartness...

818
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,200
...no home and no money.

819
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,660
We had just looked at the boy.

820
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,290
Hear that. The boy.

821
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,790
And such a boy, that I was feeling ashamed...

822
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,200
...inviting my friends to the wedding.

823
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,750
Stop it, Ravi, that's enough.

824
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,790
He is older than you. Show some respect.

825
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,290
I have shown enough respect...

826
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:08,750
...and sister, you are not going back to that house.

827
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,790
You are going to Canada with us.

828
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,870
That's it.

829
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,250
Right now I am going home.

830
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,080
What's the emergency?

831
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,080
Jugnu and Preeti are coming home
for the first time after the wedding.

832
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,950
It is important for me to be at home.

833
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,160
Mother, please,
no more talk on this now.

834
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,410
I am telling you we are
going for 6 days. That's it.

835
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,950
Why 6 days?

836
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,250
Preeti, we are going on
honeymoon and not to settle down.

837
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,120
We will go for 2 days.
2 nights, 3 days.

838
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,040
The journey itself takes two days

839
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:36,910
- Preeti.
- So far...

840
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,410
Saving money,
saving time. 2 days.

841
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,620
- Mummy!
- Yes, dear?

842
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,330
- Listen.
- Preeti, papa is here.

843
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,450
- Hello, papa.
- Hey!

844
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,620
Aren't you surprised?
Aren't you, papa?

845
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,450
- Aren't you surprised?
- Yes, of course. Of course.

846
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,330
Didn't I say he will be surprised!

847
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,200
Where is your lunchbox?

848
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,250
I ate out today.

849
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,250
When did you arrive?

850
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,080
Papa, I have been
here a long time.

851
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,250
You just didn't see me.

852
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,080
Is your father well?

853
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,040
Yes, papa, he is absolutely fine.

854
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,950
Papa, look what Jugnu
brought for you?

855
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,200
What is this?

856
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,160
Papa, take a look.

857
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,830
- Shirt.
- Papa, your favorite color.

858
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,700
Pink shirt, size 42, expensive brand.
Just for you.

859
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,950
What...what was
the need for this?

860
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,700
- Yes.
- Papa, there is a need.

861
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,080
There is a dire need.

862
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,080
And I fulfill all your needs.

863
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,040
Look here.
Your favorite 'Tunde kebabs'.

864
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:52,250
72 rupees per plate.

865
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,200
Is it today a full moon day?

866
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:55,580
No.

867
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,200
So what Papa, whether today is a full
moon day or 'Holi' (festival of colors)?

868
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,120
Please eat.
It is your favorite.

869
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,290
I have spent a lot.

870
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,700
You spend a lot.

871
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,790
Give it to your mummy.

872
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,750
Promise you will eat it?

873
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:10,040
Yes, yes, I will eat.

874
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,000
Thank you, son.

875
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:15,250
They are saying that
they are going to Manali.

876
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,500
Who is going to Manali?

877
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,950
Preeti is going.

878
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,620
Why?

879
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,950
She got married.
For her honeymoon.

880
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,500
Do whatever you want.

881
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,160
Are you going alone?

882
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:36,080
Papa, honeymoon.
She will go along, right?

883
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,750
By which train?

884
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,250
It is a hill station,
so the train doesn't go there.

885
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,450
- So we will go by car.
- What...

886
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,040
We'll hire a car.

887
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,040
Papa, I have been telling
him to go to Shimla.

888
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,290
So go to Shimla.

889
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,830
Aae, not Shimla again.

890
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,370
Mummy, didn't we decide
on Manali just now?

891
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,700
- Didn't mummy say it is Manali?
- Why do you decide everything?

892
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:57,290
If mummy says Manali
then it is Manali.

893
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,500
Mummy, didn't you go to Manali too?

894
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,250
You only said that we
will be going to Manali, right?

895
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,410
Hadn't you gone to Manali?

896
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,620
Well, you only tell us
where you had gone.

897
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,620
I just came from Assighat to Rajghat.

898
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:14,500
From that house to this house.

899
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,080
Give me ice.

900
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:38,790
Hello.

901
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,250
By what time will you return?

902
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,120
Why?

903
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,250
I am leaving.

904
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,250
So leave then.

905
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,250
What difference does it make?

906
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,790
Maybe not to you, but...

907
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,870
I have cooked dinner
and kept it in the fridge.

908
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:19,200
The Roti (flat bread) is in
the blue box. Remember to eat that.

909
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,000
Did you eat anything?

910
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,500
I am not hungry.

911
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,200
Okay, you can leave then.

912
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:41,830
The boss is calling me.
I am a little busy.

913
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:47,000
"The one to whom I wanted
to love for many lifetimes."

914
01:01:47,870 --> 01:02:03,040
"Even then I never said I love you."

915
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:10,080
"I never said that to him."

916
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:33,910
"My beloved is upset with me."

917
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:41,700
"My beloved is upset with me."

918
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:49,580
"What do I do?
How do I placate him?"

919
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:57,200
"What do I do?
How do I placate him?"

920
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:04,080
"I do not know what to do."

921
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:12,450
"My beloved is upset with me."

922
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:20,200
"My beloved is upset with me."

923
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:03,160
"To whom should I blame?"

924
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:12,370
"I'm responsible for my pain."

925
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:22,330
"To whom should I blame?"

926
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:30,290
"I'm responsible for my pain."

927
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:37,330
"It's all my mistake."

928
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:45,330
"My beloved is upset with me."

929
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:53,250
"My beloved is upset with me."

930
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,500
Papa, didn't the milkman come today?

931
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,410
What?

932
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,250
Didn't the milkman come today?

933
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,290
He does. He comes every day.

934
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,950
Is the milk kept in the fridge?

935
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,950
Yes, I keep it there in the morning.

936
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,410
Okay, give me the clothes.
I will wash them tomorrow.

937
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:12,120
Okay, okay, fine.
Anyway, I will wash them myself.

938
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,040
Papa, I will wash them.

939
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,910
Papa, you haven't
started drinking yet.

940
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,290
When will you finish eating?

941
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,620
Now...

942
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,410
I have stopped drinking.
I'm done with drinking.

943
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,330
Are you telling the truth?

944
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,870
God bless you.

945
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,790
My dear papa.

946
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,580
Papa, shall I give you
water and plug in Good Night?

947
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,660
I will plug in Good Night.

948
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,450
Okay, let me give you water.

949
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,910
- Listen. Come here.
- Yes?

950
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,540
You've cooked such tasty food.
You must eat with me.

951
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:47,450
Have you lost your mind
after marrying that crazy boy?

952
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,660
You don't eat
without Jugnu, right?

953
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,620
- How is he?
- He is fine.

954
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:52,950
- Well?
- No, papa.

955
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,830
- Well?
- No, papa.

956
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,120
- Shall I give you water?
- Yes.

957
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,790
Preeti!

958
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,750
Yes, papa?

959
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,200
You cooked the potato
curry just like your mummy does.

960
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,540
- Really?
- Yes.

961
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,830
If there is any left over keep it in
the fridge. I will take it tomorrow.

962
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,000
Okay, papa.

963
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:17,580
Very nice.

964
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,700
Take this. Papa, I will plug in
Good Night and then leave.

965
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,160
- I will come tomorrow morning.
- Thank you.

966
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,580
- Keep out the clothes.
- Okay.

967
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,200
- Bye, Papa.
- Bye.

968
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:26,870
- Good night.
- Go carefully.

969
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,870
Are you happy with all this?

970
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,330
At least he's happy.

971
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,540
Firoz.

972
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:25,000
Is Mr. Firoz at home?

973
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,290
Mr. Firoz!

974
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,830
Oh, hello.

975
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,080
You?

976
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,830
I was passing by, so by chance your...

977
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,540
Thank you very much.
Why did you take the trouble?

978
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,700
It is my duty.

979
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,620
I am going.

980
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:45,450
- Do have tea.
- No, no, tea.

981
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,330
It won't take time.

982
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:49,330
You see, I make nice tea
and Suman makes nice coffee...

983
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:51,540
...so what would you like to have,
tea or coffee?

984
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,830
Ask sister-in-law to make coffee.

985
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:56,410
- Sure, right away.
- Okay.

986
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,700
- Please take a seat.
- Okay.

987
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:15,830
Here.

988
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,330
Thank you.

989
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,700
Your house is very old.

990
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:24,870
Yes.

991
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,290
Do you live alone,
or do you have children too?

992
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:32,290
- No, I don't have children.
- Oh.

993
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,540
Sister-in-law has
made very nice coffee.

994
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:44,200
Very nice. Suman makes such wonderful
coffee that even I miss her.

995
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,370
Do you mean she didn't
make this coffee?

996
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,200
No, I made it.

997
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,290
You must make
tea and coffee in your house too.

998
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,330
Yes.

999
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,080
Actually, Suman's been
admitted in the hospital...

1000
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,290
...for the past 2 months.

1001
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:01,330
Why? What's wrong with her?

1002
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,700
She has some illness
related to the brain.

1003
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:04,620
Oh.

1004
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,250
The letter you just brought...

1005
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,620
...contains a cheque
from the insurance company.

1006
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,330
It would give her a
few more days of life.

1007
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,160
Yours was a love marriage?

1008
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:22,700
Yes. Both love marriage
as well as marriage love.

1009
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,620
What?

1010
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,040
Love marriage means
love before marriage...

1011
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,250
...and marriage love means
love even after marriage.

1012
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:35,200
Now the situation is such
that when I sit down to eat...

1013
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,660
...I place two plates.

1014
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,370
When I sit down to
have tea or coffee...

1015
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,870
...two cups are placed
automatically.

1016
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,290
One for me and one for Suman.

1017
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:46,450
Sir, you know it so happens
that after marriage...

1018
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:50,370
...people get busy
with their day-to-day life...

1019
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:56,580
...and love disappears. But with us,
something different happened.

1020
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,580
After marriage,
our love became so strong...

1021
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,500
...that we found life to be short.

1022
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:04,700
Right.

1023
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,290
Your phone.

1024
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,250
- I am leaving, okay?
- Okay.

1025
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:14,910
Thank you very much
and by God's grace...

1026
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,870
...next time you will
have coffee made by Suman.

1027
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,790
Yes, of course. Of course.

1028
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:21,950
Okay?
Take care of yourself and her.

1029
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,620
Sister-in-law can return tomorrow.

1030
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:34,000
There is no problem.

1031
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,750
But you see, there has
to be a reason for her to return.

1032
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,910
She should feel that
someone loves her.

1033
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:42,910
Someone wants her.

1034
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,040
Someone cannot live without her.

1035
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,700
Someone is waiting for her.

1036
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,750
I never praised her cooking.

1037
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,830
I thought she would know.

1038
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:59,580
I never told her that
she was looking very beautiful.

1039
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,540
I thought she would know.

1040
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,450
I wanted to stop her when
she was going. I wanted to say...

1041
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:16,370
...that I can't live
without you, Kiran.

1042
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:20,830
But I couldn't say it.

1043
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,250
I thought she would
know that anyway.

1044
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,500
It's entirely my fault.

1045
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:32,950
My fault.

1046
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:38,580
Papa, love is to talk
and also to keep silent.

1047
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,790
But it's heard only when you say it.

1048
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:47,040
Now there is no point in hearing it.

1049
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:50,790
Papa.

1050
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,040
Papa.

1051
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,250
Papa.

1052
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
What you didn't do in 24 years...

1053
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:01,870
is going to happen now.
And for sure.

1054
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:02,700
Correct.

1055
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,250
How is it going to happen?
How do I say it?

1056
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,950
What's your problem?

1057
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:10,950
You're going to meet your wife.
Not someone else's wife.

1058
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,910
Why do you need to be afraid
to say it to your own wife?

1059
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,870
Of course.

1060
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,200
Say it to her without any hesitation.

1061
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:17,620
That you're her hero.

1062
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,200
You're my Kiran.

1063
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,250
Let the world know...

1064
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:26,700
Show her that a 52-year-old
is no lesser than an 18-year-old boy.

1065
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,000
Got it?

1066
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:28,950
What say?

1067
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:38,500
'These days they say that after
God if anyone knows everything.'

1068
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,870
'Then it's Google.'

1069
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,250
'All hail Google.'

1070
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,000
All hail Google.

1071
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,290
- I will find.
- You won't.

1072
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:46,290
- Batti has said.
- Batti? Did papa say this?

1073
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:48,950
Yes. Your papa. He said that
I will find something for sure.

1074
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,250
What elders say makes sense.

1075
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,370
- I'm sure...
- We can.

1076
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,250
- How can we make love?
- Who checks all this on Google?

1077
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:55,450
What is he writing?

1078
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,540
KAN oh sorry... CAN...

1079
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,000
How can...we...

1080
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,750
Papa...

1081
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,450
I'm forgetting what I have to write.

1082
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:09,200
How can we make love?

1083
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:10,290
Go ahead.

1084
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,910
- It will show.
- Yes. Most certainly.

1085
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,160
- He seems to be highly educated. See.
- It will show. Watch. It will show.

1086
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,250
What...?

1087
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,120
What are they showing these days?

1088
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,580
What are you watching these days?

1089
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,080
What do you mean?

1090
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,200
What was that?

1091
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,660
You wanted to see this, right?

1092
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,580
No...

1093
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:32,000
It's been just two days since mummy
left. And this is what you are upto!

1094
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,660
- By mistake...
- Papa.

1095
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,200
Why are you opening it
again and again?

1096
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:41,370
Brother, you know I spent all these
years doing the chores of the house.

1097
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,000
And now that I'm free,
I feel restless.

1098
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:49,790
If you allow, may I teach here
in your institute for a few days?

1099
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,250
Here?

1100
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:53,870
Yes.

1101
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:55,830
You don't have to ask.

1102
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,000
This is your institute.

1103
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,500
You have every right.

1104
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:02,160
You can come here whenever
you want, without hesitating.

1105
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,870
And teach whenever you like.

1106
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,830
I will come every day until
I don't get a visa.

1107
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,000
I hope you never get a visa.

1108
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:13,200
I want you to stay in this city
and teach at this institute.

1109
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:17,370
I had a word.
I asked you and Batra too.

1110
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,870
- I remember.
- But you...

1111
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,450
But I didn't have time back then.

1112
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:26,450
You didn't have time or permission.

1113
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,580
Perhaps both.

1114
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:32,080
Anyways, you have time now.

1115
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:35,040
And now your permission.

1116
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,120
Okay.

1117
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:40,620
These kids are lucky
that you'll be teaching them.

1118
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,870
Come on. What are you saying?

1119
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,910
Should I make the
arrangements today itself?

1120
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,540
Not today.

1121
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,040
I'll start teaching from tomorrow.
Introduce me to the students.

1122
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,250
- Sure.
- I'll also love it.

1123
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,580
And your glasses are really nice.

1124
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,750
I wanted to tell you.
But we got busy talking.

1125
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:56,500
This.

1126
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,750
- You like this.
- It's superb.

1127
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:01,500
- You like this.
- Yes. Absolutely. It's really nice.

1128
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,290
Here.

1129
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,870
What are you doing?

1130
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,580
- The glasses...
- What are you...

1131
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,580
Please. Please. Please.

1132
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,250
It will look good on you.

1133
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:13,830
I can't see anything.

1134
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,160
Nor can I.

1135
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,250
I love you.

1136
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,660
I love you, Kiran.

1137
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,950
You're on the right track.

1138
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,910
Say it with a little more intensity.

1139
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,500
What does Intensity mean?

1140
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,120
Intensity means...

1141
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,660
Yes. Angrily.

1142
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,500
- I should say I love you angrily.
- I love you with anger.

1143
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,830
I love you!

1144
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,040
Wow. A little...

1145
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,410
I love you!

1146
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,080
What are you doing?

1147
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,160
- I'm saying I love you.
- Papa is learning to say I love you.

1148
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,500
Very good, papa.

1149
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:58,250
Shut up.

1150
01:15:58,370 --> 01:16:00,790
Even a police officer wouldn't say
I love to his wife in this manner.

1151
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:02,540
Why are you teaching him wrong things?

1152
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,290
- No.
- Is my papa dumb?

1153
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,450
- No.
- is he stupid?

1154
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:06,580
- No.
- Papa...

1155
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,000
- Intensity means...
- Yes. It means?

1156
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,910
Papa, with feelings.

1157
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,040
Warmth

1158
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:14,620
Try warmth.

1159
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,580
Warmth.

1160
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:16,660
Warmth.

1161
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:18,000
What do I have to say?
I love you.

1162
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,250
I love you. Lovingly.

1163
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,160
I love you.

1164
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,500
I...love you.

1165
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:28,750
I love you.

1166
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:29,660
I love you.

1167
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,580
I love you.

1168
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,660
Seriously.

1169
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:34,870
I love you.

1170
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,250
He took offense.

1171
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:47,290
'Writing a love letter and working at
a post office are two different things.'

1172
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:54,950
'O Lord, help me complete it.'

1173
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,290
'Dear. Darling.'

1174
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:02,200
'Respected Lover.' Beloved!

1175
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,910
'Chuck all of them.'

1176
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:11,700
'How do I say how much I love you?'

1177
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:15,200
'Love would be the wrong word.
Without you...'

1178
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,120
'I can't live without you.'

1179
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:22,580
'You are always around
me like a shadow.'

1180
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,410
'Always.'

1181
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,000
- Give me a rose.
- For whom?

1182
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,660
For my wife.

1183
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:16,910
For whose wife?

1184
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,950
For my wife.

1185
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,500
No one gives a rose to his own wife.

1186
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,950
I'm also giving it for the first time.

1187
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,950
First time.

1188
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,450
Here you are.

1189
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,120
How much?

1190
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,870
It's free, from me to your wife.

1191
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,660
What did you say?

1192
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:45,250
I mean its free for your wife
from my side.

1193
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:49,540
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

1194
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:53,790
(In Chinese Language)

1195
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,450
'Alright.
Please note down, everybody.'

1196
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:04,750
(In Chinese Language)

1197
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,500
Hey...No.

1198
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:21,000
Hello...

1199
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,580
Back problem.

1200
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,450
Kiran.

1201
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:28,540
- Direct Kiran?
- Direct Kiran.

1202
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:32,870
Husband...

1203
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,080
I'm also saying the same thing.
What is she saying?

1204
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,830
She is saying go
to the police station.

1205
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:41,580
Police station.
Why police station?

1206
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,370
Police station?

1207
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,200
Police station?

1208
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:50,160
Okay. Back to study now.

1209
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,410
What is this?

1210
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,580
This is Japan and China.

1211
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,200
India is over there.

1212
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,950
Second right.

1213
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,160
Okay.

1214
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,830
One minute. One minute.

1215
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,620
Give. Give. Give.

1216
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,620
- I've found Kiran.
- Kiran Nichketa. (In Chinese Language)

1217
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,910
Kiran Nachiketa.
(In Chinese Language)

1218
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,250
Kiran Nachiketa.
(In Chinese Language)

1219
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:08,620
Kiran Nachiketa.
(In Chinese Language)

1220
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:10,950
Stop it.

1221
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:13,120
'I don't understand.'

1222
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,250
'What is wrong with him?'

1223
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,200
Carry on.

1224
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:20,290
An Octopus.

1225
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:27,790
Or an umbrella.

1226
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,040
- Did you write?
- There's My Kiran.

1227
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:37,750
- 'The words that start from A-E-I-O-U...'
- There's My Kiran.

1228
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,410
An always precedes them.

1229
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,660
- 'What precedes? An.'
- 'An.'

1230
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:44,500
'We call them vowels.'

1231
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,160
'What do we call them? Vowels.'

1232
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:47,870
Shall I?

1233
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:53,250
Tomorrow will be a test.
Okay. Don't worry.

1234
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:54,910
No, no...

1235
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,750
Shall I?

1236
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,620
'Give it a try.
You'll surely be able to do it.'

1237
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:07,500
And if possible speak
in which language? English.

1238
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:08,200
Okay?

1239
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:10,450
'Have self-belief.'

1240
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:13,580
'I'm sure that all of you
will do really well.'

1241
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,750
- 'Don't be nervous.'
- I am already...

1242
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:20,910
'Okay. Revise whatever
I have taught you.'

1243
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,540
'Read it over and over again.'

1244
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,620
'And I'm sure all of you
will do really well tomorrow.'

1245
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:26,750
Come here.

1246
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,500
Hold this.

1247
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:31,290
Hold this well.

1248
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:35,250
Go give it to the madam inside.
Tell her I gave.

1249
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:36,160
What will you say?

1250
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:37,830
- I have.
- Not you have. I have.

1251
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,160
Say uncle gave. Okay?

1252
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,910
Go. Listen. Listen.
Give this.

1253
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:49,290
Madam, that uncle outside.
He sent this letter for you.

1254
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,580
4...

1255
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,160
5...

1256
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:53,830
6...

1257
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,370
Security!

1258
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,950
What are you doing?

1259
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,830
What are you doing?
Look, I'm from a good family.

1260
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,160
What are you...

1261
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,790
Stop it now.

1262
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,870
Who is making a racket?

1263
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,620
Some Romeo.

1264
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:22,450
He was writing a love
letter to Shreya ma'am.

1265
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,870
See...

1266
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,620
He is trying to be Shahrukh Khan,

1267
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,120
Ki-ki-ki Kiran.

1268
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,410
- Yes.
- Sorry, that's your name.

1269
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,950
Kids these days have
become very shameless.

1270
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:33,660
Kids?

1271
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,450
He's not a kid, he's an uncle.

1272
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,330
Senior citizen to be precise.

1273
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,450
See...

1274
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,950
If he's acting like this now, I wonder
what he did in his younger days.

1275
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,250
If he had paid more attention
in his younger days...

1276
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,000
this wouldn't have happened.

1277
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:16,790
"Fearful and hiding from my own."

1278
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,750
"Someone who couldn't
fulfill his dreams."

1279
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:27,200
"Fearful and hiding from my own."

1280
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:32,370
"Someone who couldn't
fulfill his dreams."

1281
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:38,500
"Seems like I'm playing
hide and seek."

1282
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:43,830
"Looks like solving a mystery."

1283
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:49,370
"Seems like I'm playing
hide and seek."

1284
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:54,580
"Looks like solving a mystery."

1285
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:59,250
"I've become helpless
ever since I've become yours."

1286
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:03,200
"Ever since I've become yours."

1287
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:09,080
"Ever since I've become yours."

1288
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:14,540
"Ever since I've become yours."

1289
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,040
"Ever since I've become yours."

1290
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:40,410
"What is this sensation in me?"

1291
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:51,370
"Which I never feel before."

1292
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:59,160
"It makes me happy."

1293
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:04,870
"Look at my style."

1294
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:09,620
"Now listen to me..."

1295
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:15,000
"Don't hurt me now."

1296
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:20,200
"I recognize myself."

1297
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:24,790
"Ever since I've become yours."

1298
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:29,660
"Ever since I've become yours."

1299
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:37,290
"Seems like I'm playing
hide and seek."

1300
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:42,700
"Looks like solving a mystery."

1301
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:47,950
"Seems like I'm playing
hide and seek."

1302
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:53,660
"Looks like solving a mystery."

1303
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:58,250
"I've become helpless
ever since I've become yours."

1304
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:02,540
"Ever since I've become yours."

1305
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,910
"Ever since I've become yours."

1306
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:13,250
"Ever since I've become yours."

1307
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:18,500
"Ever since I've become yours."

1308
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,950
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1309
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:46,660
- Firoz.
- You can't talk.

1310
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,290
You can't talk to the patient.
Remember that.

1311
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,660
It is here. It is here.
Don't worry about the money.

1312
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:21,540
It's raining heavily so
the mangoes are kind of rotten.

1313
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,120
Our riverbank is completely
submerged with water.

1314
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:31,250
It was Mr. Dubey's daughter's
wedding last night.

1315
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,580
One who lives above us.

1316
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,620
I went there for 5 minutes.

1317
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,120
Firoz.

1318
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,250
What?

1319
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,160
What?

1320
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:46,540
What?

1321
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:53,450
I don't want to go.

1322
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,910
Okay.
Where are you going?

1323
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,830
I can live without a brain.

1324
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,370
Haven't you been living without
brain for all these years ?

1325
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,750
Do you actually have one?

1326
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:18,080
It's been 18 years since
your father passed away.

1327
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,290
It is very difficult
to spend your life alone.

1328
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:26,080
Should I speak to Yashwant for you?

1329
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:27,750
No, mummy.

1330
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,580
Not required.

1331
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,290
Mother, stop all this.

1332
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:34,660
And the flight is tonight.
Get ready to leave.

1333
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:40,660
'Preeti said give flowers.'

1334
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,540
'Jugnu said to give her
a love letter.'

1335
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:43,830
'I did everything.'

1336
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:48,120
'But love doesn't
happen in this fashion.'

1337
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,750
'It is like the first dip
in the holy Ganges.'

1338
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:56,200
'It cleanses the soul the moment
it touches your body.'

1339
01:28:57,250 --> 01:29:01,500
'It makes you clean and pure.
Beautiful. Vestal.'

1340
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:05,000
'Just like Suman and Firoz.'

1341
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,950
Do you know?
I wait for this day the entire week...

1342
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:11,620
...where I can spend
the entire day with you.

1343
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,620
For Sunday?

1344
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:18,040
Do you know?

1345
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:24,620
When I was little I used to find
a letter under my pillow every Sunday.

1346
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,500
Without any name or address.

1347
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:31,450
But I knew who used to write it.

1348
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:33,540
Who?

1349
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:36,660
Papa.

1350
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,250
Yes, sir?

1351
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:45,580
Suman Firoz.

1352
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:46,540
Yes.

1353
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,620
Ward number two. Bed number seven.

1354
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:51,750
To the right.

1355
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:06,580
Firoz, did we make a
mistake by getting married?

1356
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,200
Why?

1357
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,580
Papa's letters stopped coming.

1358
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,580
Who says letters have stopped coming?

1359
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:16,910
I'll get one right now.

1360
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,410
Abracadabra.

1361
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,040
Here's the letter.

1362
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,330
Dear Suman.

1363
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,450
Lots of love love.

1364
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:35,040
You might get angry
after reading this letter.

1365
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:38,000
Or fight with me.

1366
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:41,870
Or laugh or think I'm crazy

1367
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:52,370
By the way, I went crazy
the first time I saw you.

1368
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:56,410
And I was waiting the
entire week for your answer.

1369
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,290
The entire neighborhood
knew how much I loved you.

1370
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:01,000
Except you.

1371
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,870
Yes. But no one knew
how much I loved you.

1372
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:07,950
Really? How much?

1373
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:11,620
This much.

1374
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:15,120
And how much do I love you?

1375
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:18,290
This much. 90ml.

1376
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,000
Really?

1377
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,200
Then I...love you this much.

1378
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,000
Then I love you this much.

1379
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:29,120
- And me this much.
- And I love you this much.

1380
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:31,540
This much.

1381
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,910
Suman.

1382
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,040
Hey...

1383
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,790
The letter...

1384
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,500
The letter wasn't over yet, Suman

1385
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:28,330
"The damsel sleeps
on the bed of flowers."

1386
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:37,410
"With hair covering her face."

1387
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:47,080
"Come, Khusro. Let's go home."

1388
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:56,700
"Come, Khusro. Let's go home."

1389
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:11,870
"It's night in your country."

1390
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:22,750
"It's night in your country."

1391
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:37,540
Papa.

1392
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:41,000
Papa...

1393
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:44,160
You are late.

1394
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,290
Mama is leaving.

1395
01:34:10,370 --> 01:34:15,410
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1396
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,120
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1397
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:26,620
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1398
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:32,120
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1399
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:37,580
"What a glow in my beloved's house."

1400
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:42,870
"What a glow in my beloved's house."

1401
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:48,200
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1402
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:53,540
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1403
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:59,250
"Anyone who has love in his heart."

1404
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:03,830
"Anyone who has love in his heart."

1405
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:09,250
"There is beloved in every heartbeat."

1406
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:14,000
"There is beloved in every heartbeat."

1407
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:24,290
"He knows that he is crazy.
Love is worship. Love is God."

1408
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:26,450
"Love is worship."

1409
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:34,200
"Love is worship. Love is God."

1410
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:38,160
"Every color is dull without her."

1411
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:42,700
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1412
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:47,500
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1413
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:52,200
Your papa did not come, did he?

1414
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:58,160
I knew he wouldn't come.

1415
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,250
Me going away makes
no difference to him.

1416
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:04,700
It does make a difference.

1417
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:09,040
He loves you
as much as you love him.

1418
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,660
It's just that he
is unable to express it.

1419
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:18,250
Since the past few days,
he has been doing everything you like.

1420
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:23,450
He would've come here
if it made a difference to him.

1421
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:28,580
"I can't live without meeting."

1422
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:31,580
"I can't live..."

1423
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:36,370
"Color yourself in the hue of love."

1424
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:40,700
"Color yourself in the hue of love."

1425
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:45,200
"Come and make it
up to your sulking love."

1426
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:53,500
"Come and make it
up to your sulking love."

1427
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:58,200
"Come and make it
up to your sulking love."

1428
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:02,540
"Without whom you'll
find it difficult to live."

1429
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:06,080
"What a glow in my beloved's house."

1430
01:37:06,290 --> 01:37:10,290
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1431
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:14,290
"Oh mother, what a glow."

1432
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,700
Papa. Papa, over there.

1433
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,700
We're going to Canada.

1434
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:26,790
Papa.

1435
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:28,750
Now we've got to tolerate him.

1436
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:34,250
What?

1437
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:35,750
Stop her.

1438
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,160
No, no. She is doing the right thing.
Let her go.

1439
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:41,410
She is correct. She understands
what's good or bad for her.

1440
01:37:41,950 --> 01:37:43,370
But...

1441
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:44,750
Good.

1442
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,080
Good.

1443
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,870
I would like to say something to you.

1444
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,250
You were right.

1445
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:59,250
I was only abiding by our marriage
for the last 24 years.

1446
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:05,620
I've fallen in love
with you now.

1447
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:08,040
Really.

1448
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:16,790
Your absence made me
realize you being there.

1449
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,870
I've grown closer to you.

1450
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:24,040
Sister, enough of the chit-chat

1451
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:25,870
His right.

1452
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:27,580
Enough of the chit-chat

1453
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:32,830
Go. Go.

1454
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,040
Live your new life.

1455
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:39,040
But the day even
a little love invokes in you...

1456
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,950
You have a home here too.

1457
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:53,950
You have taken everything, right?

1458
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:57,500
Come on. Say bye to Papa.
To mummy.

1459
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:59,250
Say bye.

1460
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:02,910
You also come.

1461
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:04,410
Yes.

1462
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:13,700
We'll miss the flight
because of them.

1463
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,370
I say let's go.

1464
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:20,040
- Come on.
- Let's go, sister.

1465
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,620
Take her.

1466
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:26,910
Come.

1467
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:02,870
'It's been a good
one month six days today...'

1468
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:09,040
'...that I have been living
my life on my own terms.'

1469
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,410
'Perhaps this is what we wanted.'

1470
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,500
'There must be so much
to see over there.'

1471
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:24,250
'Clean air. Wide roads.'

1472
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:27,790
'And here it's the same.'

1473
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:32,290
'What do they call those
gigantic waterfalls? Nalanda falls!

1474
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,540
'It's not Nalanda.
It's called Niagara falls.'

1475
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:38,040
'I know. I know.'

1476
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:41,200
'It had everything.'

1477
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:44,000
'Clean air.'

1478
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:45,700
'Self-determination.'

1479
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:48,120
'Everything.'

1480
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,660
'But you weren't there.'

1481
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,370
'And here you weren't there.'

1482
01:40:56,160 --> 01:41:00,660
'Everything seems
incomplete without you.'

1483
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:04,700
'I'm coming.'

1484
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:08,620
'Will you come?'

1485
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:13,160
'Yes. I will.'

1486
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:55,830
Is this all the luggage you have?

1487
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:57,950
This is all I took with me.

1488
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,870
Looking nice.

1489
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:07,410
I'm telling you.

1490
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:08,870
Well...

1491
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:12,330
I thought let me
dress as per the season.

1492
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:17,250
You also wrapped a stole
or something.

1493
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:19,870
Yes. It was chilly inside the flight.

1494
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:24,330
They discontinued our water supply.

1495
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,370
What do you mean they
discontinued water supply?

1496
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:27,290
I mean...

1497
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,080
the water supply of our house.

1498
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:32,250
How can they do that?
You must not have paid the bill.

1499
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:33,500
I did. I did.

1500
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:34,660
So how did they discontinued
the water supply?

1501
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:35,870
I paid it late.

1502
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:38,330
It will make things worse now.

1503
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,410
You should've been mindful.

1504
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:41,790
Since the past couple of days...

1505
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:43,910
No. You don't worry.
Have you eaten?

1506
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,870
No. I am really hungry.

1507
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:48,250
There is food.

1508
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:52,160
Slow cooked Potato
and pointed gourd. Rice.

1509
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:54,250
Gram chutney.

1510
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:55,910
- Did you make it?
- Yes.

1511
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:57,830
I can even wash clothes.

1512
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:59,870
You can wash clothes?

1513
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:05,500
You won't have any trouble now.

1514
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,250
I bought a washing machine.

1515
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:15,660
Now we'll have to get
the house painted.

1516
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:24,330
I've changed all the tins
of rations. All of them.

1517
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:27,330
Mister. Mister.
Move a little.

1518
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:29,120
- A little.
- Yes. Sorry.

1519
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,250
- Let's go.
- Come. Let's go.

1520
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:43,870
The boss's lover has just landed.

1521
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,750
Why are you sitting like that?

1522
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:58,750
I'm sitting properly.

1523
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:00,910
Hold me. Hold me tightly.

1524
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:04,870
Tighter.

1525
01:44:07,330 --> 01:44:08,370
Tighter.

1526
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:11,250
Let's go.

1527
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:13,540
That's better.

1528
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:18,000
'The hero of every story
is not your quintessential hero.'

1529
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:22,160
'At times it is a common man
like Yashwant, you and me.'

1530
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:24,000
'The hero of his story.'
