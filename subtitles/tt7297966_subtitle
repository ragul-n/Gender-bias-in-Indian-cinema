1
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,708
How much?

2
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,250
Keep the coin inside.

3
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,333
Why do you keep eating?

4
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,500
What will people think of you?

5
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,041
They won't buy.

6
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,916
Eat this dear.

7
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,000
How much did we make Mother?

8
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,458
About 25 rupees.

9
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,333
Only 25 rupees?

10
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,625
I want to see the concert.

11
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,791
You sit here alone okay. I'm bored.

12
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,583
Just stay for a while.

13
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,958
No, please!

14
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:48,125
Dhunu, Dhunu
Come to harvest betel nut.

15
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,166
Here... throw it to me!

16
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,041
Where have you run off to? Huh?

17
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,625
Your sister is doing your job!

18
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,791
Go away.

19
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,375
Will you?

20
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,500
Coming again!

21
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,958
Going or not?

22
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,541
Damn.

23
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,958
Here is the showoff.

24
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,625
Hit him.

25
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,625
Bogi, these stories are interesting.

26
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,166
Can I please borrow this comic book?

27
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,500
Okay but return it soon.

28
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Return it to me soon,
I need to read it too.

29
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,250
Okay, let me see this one.

30
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,000
(Reciting Assamese alphabet)

31
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,166
What are you reading?

32
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,333
You shouldn't read
comics in the classroom.

33
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,208
Bolo,stop shining
the light on my face.

34
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,750
This is turning out really good.

35
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,291
Stop disturbing us!

36
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,375
Go!

37
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,208
Go and sit there.

38
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,375
Oi!

39
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,833
You have come to watch,
so just keep quiet.

40
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,375
I am being polite.

41
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,583
It will look beautiful
when I make it.

42
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,208
Shut your mouth.

43
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Go away!

44
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,250
No need to come and show off!

45
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,541
Go..Go from here!

46
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,333
The showoff again.

47
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,791
Look at him.

48
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,250
Catch him!

49
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,625
How dare he slap Dhunu!

50
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,708
Catch him! Catch him!

51
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't run anymore.
He's gone.

52
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,083
Don't cry sister.

53
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,916
We will find a way
to punish him.

54
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,041
Here, take your books.

55
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,250
Let's go. We are late.

56
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,416
Don't cry.

57
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,083
We will beat him up
if we see him.

58
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,125
Stop it, that's enough.

59
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,458
Wait.

60
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,625
You keep
playing with those boys.

61
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,916
Huh.

62
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,458
You even go to school
with the boys.

63
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,416
Why don't you go
with the girls?

64
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,291
Huh.

65
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,416
Munu!

66
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,791
Enjoying your grass my dear?

67
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,750
Let's go.
Drink some water.

68
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,750
Hold on my dear! I am getting
you some fresh leaves.

69
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,083
You didn't do a good job.

70
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,250
You should have thrown
the cycle into the water!

71
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,875
You were not there.

72
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,583
The police would
have caught us not you.

73
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,083
No need to go
if you are so scared.

74
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:17,041
She's your sister.
If it was my sister I would have gone.

75
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,000
My father would have kicked me
out of the house!

76
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,583
It's not so easy!

77
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,541
What kind of father
will kick out his own son!

78
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,958
What will you know?

79
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,833
Bhebelu is scared for nothing.

80
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,333
Do you remember
how you slapped me that day?

81
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,083
Do you think
I have forgotten it?

82
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,583
My cheeks had turned red.

83
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,958
Couldn't sleep in the night.

84
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,083
Even my Mother and Brother
don't beat me like that.

85
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,791
Isn't that right brother?

86
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,250
Right.

87
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,166
You have to ask for apology
to be a part of our Rockstar band.

88
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,458
isn't it brother?

89
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,041
Yes.

90
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:13,958
Do you agree Bolo?

91
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,333
Yes, yes.

92
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,416
Will you ask for an
apology or not?

93
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,458
Sorry!

94
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,250
You will also have to let us
ride your cycle.

95
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,625
Wait! Wait!

96
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,750
Go... Go... Go... Let's go!

97
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,541
Hey Bolo!

98
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,250
Have you finished
reading the story book?

99
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,125
No.

100
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,875
The girl's been asking
for it back.

101
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,583
I need to return it.

102
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,625
Give me the utensils.

103
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,083
I have got
something interesting today.

104
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,416
I will show it to you.

105
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,125
What is it?

106
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,916
Wait, let me show you.

107
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,166
Look there are so many small
kids with a rock band!

108
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,666
Oh! Nice!

109
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,583
Yep. That's nice!

110
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,166
Look!
They got an award at the end.

111
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,875
Wow! It's a gold prize!

112
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,666
Let's also form a band like this.

113
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,916
A band costs a lot of money.

114
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,250
How much will
a real guitar cost?

115
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,750
Will it be around
five hundred rupees?

116
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,500
Huh?

117
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,041
Who will give you a guitar for
five hundred rupees?

118
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,416
There are no fish.

119
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,833
Damn it!

120
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,875
Did you catch anything?

121
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,791
Nope.

122
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,708
Brother! I almost got one.

123
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,541
Where?

124
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,458
One large prawn.

125
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,458
You are just making things up!

126
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,333
Why would I lie?
You can come see.

127
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,125
Dhunu careful!
You will fall down.

128
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,333
Come back!

129
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,375
Pull! I've got you!

130
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,875
I won't let you go...

131
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,958
Pull it out, pull it out...

132
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,333
Why do you keep blabbering?

133
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,208
We should not let him
fish with us!

134
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,166
He keeps talking like
a mad man!

135
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,625
Oh God!
My rod broke.

136
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,791
So your rod broke.

137
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,666
Ha ha!

138
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,291
Look, I caught a big one!

139
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,583
Let's go,
I have had enough!

140
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,208
Hundred and fifty rupees.

141
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,708
One fifty rupees?

142
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,208
For this little one?

143
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,541
It's so small.

144
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,375
Two fingers long.

145
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,541
Oi, leave the guiar alone.

146
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,250
It belongs to someone else.

147
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,625
Who would have thought one guitar's
worth five or six thousand?

148
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,083
Oh my God!
They are so expensive.

149
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,458
We will only be
rockstars in our dreams.

150
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,708
We can't even get it here.
We'll have to go to the city.

151
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,416
The guitar itself is so expensive.

152
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,291
We also need
drumset, casio, and pads.

153
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,583
Your Father has money.
He can help us!

154
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,666
No, he won't.
He doesn't like music.

155
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,583
Munu...
it's beginning to rain.

156
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,750
Let's go home.

157
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,541
Dhunu!

158
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,958
Dhunu!

159
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,333
Where did these two go!

160
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,541
Where did you run off to?

161
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,708
The firewood's wet.
The cloths are wet.

162
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:18,958
Huh!

163
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,666
To get Munu.

164
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:24,125
You have no responsibilities
towards anything in the house.

165
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,375
Where is your brother?
Huh?

166
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,416
Look at her.
She is so spoiled.

167
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,083
I have not seen
a girl like her.

168
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,000
Come here girl.

169
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,750
Why are you climbing
the trees with those boys?

170
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,791
You will become
a woman soon.

171
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,916
Why do you need
to climb trees?

172
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,958
Society will segregate you
if you roam around with boys.

173
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,375
Can't you find any girls
to play with?

174
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,375
Why always need to
play with boys?

175
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,375
Your mother doesn't say anything?

176
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,375
If you were my daughter
I would punish you.

177
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,250
They want to punish my daughter
climbing a tree!

178
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,625
I do everything myself.

179
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,958
Is anyone there
to share my burden?

180
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:37,791
How have they ganged
up on my daughter!

181
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,416
What happened?

182
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:45,583
Look here. They are punishing
my daughter for climbing a tree!

183
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,083
They scolded her.

184
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,708
I am suffering
after her father's death.

185
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,291
I have to do everything myself.

186
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,791
I am in trouble.

187
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:54,250
That's why I am letting
my girl to do everything.

188
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,875
Have I bothered anyone
so these people are harassing my daughter?

189
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,541
After my husband's death
I do everything myself.

190
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,708
Who can stop people from talking.

191
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:05,250
People take chances
when there is no man in the house.

192
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,083
Oi.

193
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,750
Keep it there.

194
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Is this enough?

195
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,958
Take more!

196
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,916
Is this much enough?

197
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,583
Keep swimming.

198
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,916
Go on...

199
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,958
Keep swimming.

200
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,375
How did you learn to swim?

201
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:14,333
We were fishing
on the other bank.

202
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,708
I couldn't swim yet
I didn't know what to do.

203
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:23,208
My friends encouraged me to swim back
and kept telling me I could do it.

204
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:27,125
So I swam
but then they were far away.

205
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:32,250
I swam and swam...
three times I sank before reaching the bank.

206
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,916
That's how I learnt.

207
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,041
You learnt just like that?

208
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,541
You can also swim
if you show courage.

209
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,541
Why Father could not swim?

210
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,666
He never stopped being afraid.

211
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:49,458
That is why
he drowned in the flood.

212
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,875
Take the goat
to graze on that side.

213
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,125
There is grass there.

214
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,000
Not now...
it's going to rain.

215
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,541
No, it won't!

216
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,458
Mother!

217
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,875
Do we have money
in the bank?

218
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,708
Mother...
do we have money?

219
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,208
Mother!

220
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,416
No.

221
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,708
Mother... can you buy
me a real guitar?

222
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,000
Mother... will you buy
one for me?

223
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,666
Will you mother?

224
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,833
Okay, we will
sell the goat and buy it.

225
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,416
Why will we sell Munu?

226
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,958
How much are you selling it for?

227
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:54,041
Not much. I also buy from others.

228
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,541
Mostly five rupees!

229
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,666
We only repair guitars.
We don't sell them.

230
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,125
Oi Sister... Sister!

231
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:15,708
Come back.

232
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,791
Someone left this for repairs
six months back.

233
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:25,958
If he doesn't come
back soon I might sell this.

234
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,958
How much does it cost?

235
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:33,375
I can give you a discount.

236
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,500
How many times have
you failed in the same class?

237
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,166
Three times.

238
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,958
And you are still loafing around
after three times.

239
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:50,750
Huh!

240
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,375
You roam around
but you don't study! Heh!

241
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,500
Show me your hand!

242
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,125
Why do you
keep your hair so long?

243
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,958
Will you cut your hair
tomorrow or not?

244
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,291
If you don't
I will teach you a lesson.

245
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,583
Oi! What do you want?

246
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,458
Owl!

247
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,125
Owl!

248
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,250
Owl!

249
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,333
Owl! Owl!

250
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,166
Owl!

251
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,083
Will you say it again?

252
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:43,750
Owl!

253
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,291
Enough now...
let's go.

254
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,458
There is no curry?

255
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,500
O Brother!

256
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,708
O Manabendra!

257
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,458
O Brother!

258
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,500
Manabendra oi!

259
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,666
Brother o!

260
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,916
Manabendra oi!

261
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,375
Brother o!

262
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:09,750
There he is!

263
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:54,916
Dharma, the creator
told Prince Yudhishthira.

264
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:58,541
I will ask five questions.

265
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,875
If you answer them properly
you can have water.

266
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:06,208
And you will be able to save
one of your five brothers.

267
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:08,166
Only one?

268
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,166
Yes, only one.

269
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:15,750
After that, the creator asked
who is bigger than the world?

270
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:19,583
Yudhishthira said,
Father or Dad.

271
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:20,916
Father!

272
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:24,125
After that, he asked
who is larger than the sky?

273
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,291
Yudhishthira said Mother.

274
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,375
Mother!

275
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:35,500
Then he asked,
what is the fastest thing in the world?

276
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,833
Yudhishthira said mind.

277
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,625
There is nothing
faster than the mind.

278
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,458
How?

279
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:50,166
If you think you are here and then
you imagine yourself at the school, you are immediately there.

280
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:53,583
Actually you are not at school,
you are asleep on your bed.

281
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,041
That is how your mind works.

282
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,791
Without taking a step
you are there.

283
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,750
That is mind.

284
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,916
Dharma then asked
who is the richest?

285
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:08,958
Yudhishthira said
the one who is not greedy.

286
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,416
The one who has no greed.

287
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:16,291
Whose only desire is to serve God.

288
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:19,833
He is the richest.

289
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:27,916
Baby... my little baby.

290
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,916
O Munu...

291
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,958
Stop it...

292
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,916
Mother tell me
'Who is the richest'?

293
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,000
Who?

294
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,291
The one who has no greed.

295
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,750
And who lives to serve God
is the richest.

296
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,083
Who gave you this idea?

297
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,875
Grandfather from up north told me.

298
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:02,916
And, what is larger than the sky?

299
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,583
You, only you... Mother.

300
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:29,708
Whatever is in our thoughts,

301
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:34,791
we can materialize it into reality.

302
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:42,958
All thoughts turn into
things eventually.

303
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:52,083
Your negative thoughts
will create negative actions.

304
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:59,291
If you focus on positive thoughts...

305
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:04,166
- Did the kids go to school?
- Dhunu has.

306
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,708
But I am worried about my son.

307
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:08,500
Ever since the teacher beat him,
he has avoided going to school.

308
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,583
I don't know what to do!

309
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,916
Where is my share?

310
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:25,000
Leave it,
I don't want to eat it.

311
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:49,791
If this embankment was there that time,
I would have my father today!

312
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:29,166
Bolo.

313
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,500
Hmm.

314
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,333
If I tell you something
can you promise me not to tell anyone?

315
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,208
Hmm.

316
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,500
I will have a real guitar soon.

317
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,958
How?

318
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,875
I will have it, I know.

319
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:53,166
Actually, I have read,
if you want something you will get it.

320
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,791
I have kept the paper.
I will give it to you too.

321
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:01,791
Hmm.

322
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,000
If I tell the others,
will they laugh at me?

323
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,416
I don't know,
they might laugh.

324
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:05,125
I will have my own guitar.

325
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,041
Looks like it will rain.

326
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:21,750
It won't rain.
Sunshine is behind us.

327
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,583
Manabendra loves one of them.

328
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,708
Bye dear girls.
See you tomorrow.

329
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,458
Such a brat!

330
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,833
The girls look good in pink dresses.

331
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,666
I will tell your parents.
They will punish you!

332
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:48,583
And Brother, Mother will teach you a lesson.

333
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,541
I will beat you if you do!

334
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:51,958
You dare beat me?

335
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,000
Come on! Beat me!

336
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,791
Dhunu is a good girl.
She won't say anything.

337
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,458
Manabendra is in love
with one of the girls.

338
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,500
Wait until we get home.
I'll teach you a lesson!

339
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,375
The others don't have
any interest for a rock band.

340
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:18,583
The are just interested in girls.

341
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,875
My brother
is the biggest culprit.

342
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:28,208
This road is bad.
Get on to the other side.

343
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,083
I will manage.
You don't have to get down.

344
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,750
Grandpa if I want something,
will I actually get it?

345
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:31,416
If your will power is strong
and you're determined to achieve it.

346
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:35,166
If you keep working towards it..

347
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:38,000
Then you will get it.
Why won't you?

348
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:42,083
But what do you want?

349
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:44,166
A guitar.

350
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:45,875
Guitar!

351
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,083
Oh my God!
Guitars are very expensive!

352
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,291
Although, you might be able to
make do with a cheap one

353
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:54,833
as you will be learning!

354
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:59,416
Remember I told you,
you should study hard and get a scholarship.

355
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:01,833
The scholarship
will get you money.

356
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:07,500
Then you could also sell goat milk.

357
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:16,458
You can sell
vegetables from your garden.

358
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:20,000
Hide all your money
in a bamboo trunk.

359
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:37,875
Come dear!
Help me collect the betel nuts.

360
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:40,208
Climb down... carefully.

361
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:34,291
Aunty, let me know when you need me again
to harvest betel nut.

362
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,083
Ok dear.

363
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,708
Twenty rupees.

364
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,708
Thirty rupees.

365
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,833
Thirty five.

366
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:06,666
The big one is mine!

367
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,916
The big one is mine!

368
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,958
I'm wet! I'm wet!

369
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,166
Oi! Do you think it will flood?

370
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:21,750
The floods are already here!

371
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:23,666
Everything is getting submerged.

372
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,833
Look we used to climb that tree!

373
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,125
It's under water now.

374
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:32,333
What will happen now?

375
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,958
This road will be submerged soon.

376
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,708
Surely it will.
Look the water level!

377
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:48,291
We need to ban the flood!

378
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,875
Yes we will!
Yes we will!

379
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,416
We need to ban the rain!

380
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:52,583
Ban the rain!
Ban the rain!

381
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,208
We need to ban the flood!

382
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:57,250
Yes! Ban the flood!
Ban the flood!

383
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,500
We need to ban the rain!

384
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,833
Ban the rain!
Ban the rain!

385
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:01,541
Our demand must be fulfilled!

386
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,458
Must be fulfilled!
Must be fulfilled!

387
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:06,333
Our demand must be fulfilled!

388
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:10,416
Must be fulfilled!
Must be fulfilled!

389
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,083
Mother, are we going
to have a flood?

390
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,125
Yes.

391
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:20,000
- The flood has already taken the bridge.
- I know.

392
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,666
How will we go to school?

393
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:28,125
- You will have to take the long way around.
- That will be very far!

394
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,875
But you have to go to school.

395
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,125
Brother will use that
as an excuse not to go to school.

396
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,000
Dhunu!

397
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,875
Why are you in the water?

398
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,916
Hold on...
I am just checking the water level.

399
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,250
Bolo, get the goats.

400
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:17,416
I am bringing them.

401
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,500
Give me the box.

402
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,125
Careful you'll drop it.

403
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,791
Come...
come out of there

404
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,291
Let's go my dear.

405
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,750
Come...
come out here.

406
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,833
- Bolo, can you manage by yourself?
- I think so.

407
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:00,083
Wait, let me help you.

408
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:04,458
Come... come dear.

409
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,500
Slowly...
the goat will jump off.

410
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,708
Hold on.

411
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,208
Don't be worried!

412
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:28,333
The boat is sinking.

413
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:30,541
Don't worry.

414
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:33,000
Scoop the water
out from the boat.

415
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,916
Row slowly.

416
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:02,708
The farm's completely destroyed.

417
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,541
We lose our farm
in the flood every year.

418
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:55,625
Why do you still farm?

419
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,333
It happened last time too.

420
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,916
Work is religion for us.

421
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:14,791
Hard work is
the only thing we have.

422
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:46,166
The floods have taken
the bridge with it.

423
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,375
The flow is too much.

424
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,375
We can not go ahead.

425
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,000
Let's not try,
it's dangerous.

426
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,875
I can see a pillar there.

427
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:12,458
I can see one more pillar!

428
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,333
The water will take
at least 3-4 more days to recede.

429
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:22,833
If the embankment breaks
our house will be completely flooded.

430
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:40,583
Cut these ones.

431
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:47,750
Cut them
at the bottom Dhunu.

432
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:50,708
But I can't reach the roots!

433
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,000
Let me cut them
on the sides.

434
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:00,875
Oi...
bring the boat here!

435
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:03,083
Wait! We are on our way!

436
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,125
Hurry.

437
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:21,625
Stack this with the rest.

438
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,916
I could have brought my hat.

439
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:45,958
Yes, you should have.

440
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:49,291
It's cold.

441
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:59,625
They didn't tie
the ropes properly.

442
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:01,541
That is why.

443
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,000
They didn't do a good job.

444
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:06,250
People are useless!

445
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,583
Come...
leave your slippers there.

446
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,125
Leave your slippers.

447
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,666
Careful... or you will fall.

448
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:45,708
Go.

449
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,916
Come around.

450
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,833
Wait... you'll fall
if you come that way!

451
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,958
Step on the raft first.

452
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:09,875
Are you hurt?

453
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:14,333
No, but I'm all wet.

454
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:19,750
What a fall!

455
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,666
Stop playing Bhaskar.

456
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:37,500
If you fall
your mother will beat me.

457
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,416
She won't.

458
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,375
Just watch out!

459
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:43,958
- Pass it to me.
- You don't know how.

460
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,958
I can manage.

461
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,208
You don't need to.

462
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,250
Please.

463
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,083
Do you know how deep the
water is if you fall in?

464
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,000
You won't be able to do this.

465
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:08,125
Do you know who lived here?

466
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:10,000
No idea.

467
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,416
A tribal family, Rabha.

468
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:12,333
They were new here.

469
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:21,208
Have you seen the embankment
on the other side?

470
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:23,541
No, I haven't.

471
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,500
The embankment
was not there when I was small.

472
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:32,583
This whole place used to be
like a sea during the flood.

473
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:42,250
My father died because
the embankment was not there at that time.

474
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:51,875
How old were you?

475
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,916
I was...
I remember that.

476
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:01,833
Did it flood
where you were living before?

477
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:04,125
No.

478
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,583
If the embankment breaks
will there be more water here?

479
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:13,833
Yes if it breaks
there will be more water everywhere.

480
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,875
Everything will drown.

481
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:28,958
Why did you take
Bhaskar with you?

482
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,375
Huh?

483
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,083
Do you even know
how to row?

484
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:36,791
Do you?

485
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,541
Do you know
how to row when it's flooded?

486
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:42,583
Why did you take
someone else's child?

487
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,666
His mother was worried sick.

488
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:48,875
One has died already.
Do you also want to die?

489
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:50,375
Huh?

490
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:45,375
Mother,
will the crops survive?

491
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:49,791
No, it won't.

492
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,916
Mother, are you not sleepy?

493
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:25,958
No.

494
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,541
Go to sleep.

495
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,416
I will sleep soon.

496
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,416
Dhunu, what are you doing?

497
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,750
Why making noise Dhunu?

498
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:16,791
Dhunu, what are you up to?

499
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,500
Ten.

500
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:06,458
Thirty.

501
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:10,875
Fourty.

502
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,208
Fifty.

503
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:18,750
Sixty.

504
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,083
Seventy... Eighty... Ninety.

505
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:26,916
Maa, please close your eyes.

506
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:27,500
Why?

507
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,541
Just close them.

508
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:30,833
- First tell me why.
- Please close, Maa.

509
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,333
Show me your hands.

510
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,041
Show me fast.

511
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:41,750
Where did you get
so much money?

512
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,625
By harvesting the betel nuts.

513
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,083
Who told you to do that?

514
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:48,291
Am I not feeding you?

515
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:51,083
Don't go work
for other people.

516
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:52,666
Okay dear?

517
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,875
Where is my goat!

518
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:07,500
Brother!
Have you seen my goat?

519
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,750
I looked everywhere,
but couldn't find her.

520
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,458
Munu!

521
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:13,416
Munu!

522
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:16,083
Come here!

523
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,750
Munu!

524
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:41,916
- You are good for nothing.
- Come this way.

525
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,250
Munu!
Where are you?

526
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:04,125
Munu!
Where are you?

527
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,208
Munu!
Come my dear!

528
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:25,458
Rascal fox!

529
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:38,083
Look over there.

530
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,333
Munu my dear.

531
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:42,375
- I think a jakal might have eaten her.
- Let's go to the other side.

532
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,875
Come here... please.

533
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,416
We're running out of oil.

534
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:11,583
Munu my dear.

535
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:15,708
No oil for fire.

536
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:19,208
Munu.

537
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,875
Munu! Come here.

538
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,958
Munu.

539
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,041
Oi Basanti!

540
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:34,208
Your girl got puberty.

541
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:39,875
Your girl got puberty.

542
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:43,166
What happened to Dhunu?

543
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:47,541
You boys go away!
You are not allowed to watch!

544
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:52,541
Come my dear!

545
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:57,333
She can't see a boy
and is not allowed to eat rice.

546
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:01,541
Only fruits.

547
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:04,250
Keep her separately.

548
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,083
Oh God!
Why are you making me wear this?

549

Tree nymph! Get down!

01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,583
You will be
