1
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,560
Good morning, sir.

2
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,160
This is Rajiv Chabbra calling
from PP Pavitra Pani Purifier.

3
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,320
Stop with your purifier nonsense.

4
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
I will complain about you
if you call me again.

5
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,240
One minute.
- Hang up now.

6
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, sir. Thank you.

7
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
Hello. Good morning, sir.

8
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,480
This is Rajiv calling from
PP Purifier, sir.

9
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,760
You...

10
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,990
Good morning, ma’am.

11
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,760
This is Rajiv Chhabra calling
from PP Purifier.

12
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
I spoke to you yesterday...

13
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,880
No. No.
- We drink water from the earthen pot.

14
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,080
I was...
- I don’t want it. I don’t want it.

15
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,400
Thank you. Thank you.

16
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,000
(Ring tone)

17
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,960
Yes, Samir.
- Rajiv, come fast.

18
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,080
Boss is getting angry.

19
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,640
I am coming. I am on my way.

20
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,480
I am coming. I am coming.
I have almost reached.

21
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
Sir, please drive faster.

22
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,800
Sir, this is not a plane to fly away.

23
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,280
Amazing! Don’t you have manners?

24
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,680
Don’t you know how to talk?

25
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,920
And why did you stop the car?

26
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,120
There is a jam ahead.

27
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
There is no space to move out.
I am bound to stop the car.

28
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
What nonsense.

29
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,520
Yes, Sameer.
- Where are you?

30
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
Sameer,
I am stuck in a jam at the RTO.

31
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,280
What do I do?
- You will lose your job.

32
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,200
No. No. No. Don’t say that Sameer.
Please manage.

33
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,480
Leave the car and run on foot.

34
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,800
I am coming. I am coming.

35
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
Sir, how much till here?

36
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
Here you are.
I will walk from here.

37
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Hmm.

38
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,560
Here you are.

39
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,760
And the remaining 20?

40
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,440
They are torn.
- I will make do.

41
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Run. You will lose your job
for the 20 bucks.

42
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,440
Have tea on my behalf. Go and die.

43
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,160
I will also have snacks.

44
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,960
I will complain about you
to Yoyo cabs.

45
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I won’t even give you stars.

46
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,960
You will lose your rating.

47
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,320
Run. You will lose your job.

48
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,080
Hello, young man.

49
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Hello, uncle.

50
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,160
You look very tired.

51
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,320
Uncle, I am in a huge mess.
- What?

52
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
Forget it, uncle.

53
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,160
Are you worried about your job?

54
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,840
Uncle, if you don’t mind,
may I ask you something?

55
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,480
How old are you?

56
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,880
Have you ever done a private job?

57
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,560
Uncle, you will die at 50.

58
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,880
Private firms suck
the life out of you.

59
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,120
On top of that they say,
show some energy.

60
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,160
Show some energy.

61
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,280
Have vitamins.

62
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,080
Vitamins, uncle.
What vitamins?

63
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,440
Vitamin A is taken by the traffic.

64
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,760
Vitamin B is taken by my boss.

65
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,320
Vitamin C makes a fool of me.

66
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Sunny takes away Vitamin D.

67
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,960
And Sameer takes away my Vitamin E.

68
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
What happened?

69
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,990
Uncle, the lift is stuck.
I will lose my job.

70
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,200
So, what?

71
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,080
Pakistan and China
will attack together.

72
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,400
Will you cry then or fight?

73
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,240
Uncle, we will deal about that
when it will happen.

74
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,080
Son, this is an emergency blackout.

75
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,480
Manage the front, soldier.
Come on.

76
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,040
Uncle, just shut up.

77
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I am really going to start
abusing now. Move.

78
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,200
(Sanskrit prayers)

79
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,560
Hey.
- Run. Run.

80
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,520
You had pressed the 3rd floor.
You had to go further up.

81
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
Uncle,
this lift might get stuck again.

82
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
I don’t want to risk it.

83
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,480
One should take risks.
It is could to take risks, son.

84
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,760
Uncle, why don’t you take risks?

85
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
Make this your battlefield.
Turn this into your bunker.

86
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
You damned scared chicken.

87
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,760
Sorry.

88
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,440
I will message you the address.

89
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,600
One minute. One minute.

90
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,440
Bro, where were you?
Bro, where were you?

91
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,280
Forget that. What is boss saying?

92
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
Boss is very angry.

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,640
He is creating new abuses
with your name.

94
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,520
Yell me, if I should go or not?

95
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,560
If you don’t go,
you will lose your job for sure.

96
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,800
And if you go there then...
- Then?

97
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,840
Go inside, you will find out.

98
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,880
Why are you talking in riddles?
Just tell me to go.

99
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
Listen to me. Calm down.

100
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,200
Hi, Sonam.

101
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,920
Hi, Rajiv. Why are you so late.

102
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,880
No. Do you know the traffic outside?
I have come running.

103
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,480
Now run and go.
He is waiting for you.

104
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
Sameer, wait for a moment.

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,360
You saw that I was speaking to here.
One minute.

106
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,160
By the way how is your toothache?

107
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,920
Is it okay?
Have you taken any medicines?

108
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,040
Yes, it’s better.

109
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
Sameer had got the medicines.

110
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,480
Thanks, bro.

111
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,680
That’s my duty.

112
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,160
Sonam is not your girlfriend
after all.

113
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,990
She is my friend too.

114
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
You just think anything.

115
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,560
You take care.

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,320
I will take care of her.

117
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,480
Go and take care of your job.

118
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,200
Shraddha, just trust me.

119
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,480
You know, I am there.

120
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,160
Your entire life is left.

121
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,990
We will do it together.

122
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
As friends.

123
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,440
You moron.

124
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,560
What do I do with you?

125
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,760
How dare you enter
without permission?

126
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,990
Sir, you had called me.

127
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,960
Bhaskar.

128
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,960
Yes, sir.

129
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,400
Parrot nosed man.

130
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,240
I have told you so many times
not to allow..

131
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,160
..anyone to enter inside
without permission.

132
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,200
Go and get some coffee.

133
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,520
And listen.

134
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,520
Get two.

135
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,160
Thank you, sir.

136
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,440
All right.

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
Will you have coffee?

138
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,000
Inauspicious one.

139
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,240
Not for you.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
For madam.

141
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,880
You haven’t sold a single purifier
last month.

142
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,840
Sir, I am trying my best.

143
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,560
What can I do
if they are not getting sold?

144
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,800
Look at Sameer.

145
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,480
He has sold 42 in 6 months.

146
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,960
He has only got big pumps.

147
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,360
He doesn’t have a lot of guts.
- You are correct.

148
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,840
Sir, may I leave?

149
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,480
Sweety, I still need to tell you
more things.

150
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,440
Relax.

151
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,800
Yeah.

152
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,280
Now listen carefully.

153
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,880
If you don’t sell at least
one purifier till this Friday..

154
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,240
..then I have already got
your resignation letter typed.

155
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,990
Got it?

156
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,600
Yes.
- Sir, may I leave?

157
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,400
No, you sit.
I will leave.

158
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,520
Right, sir?
- Yes.

159
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,720
Leave.

160
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,440
Call the customers.
Request him.

161
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,360
Beg him.
Do anything.

162
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,990
But sell purifiers.

163
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,990
Otherwise if you don’t sell one
by Friday..

164
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,120
..I will get you cursed by Saturn
on Saturday.

165
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,080
This is enough. Got it.

166
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,960
You cannot talk to me like this.

167
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,600
You know my dad used to talk
to my mom like this.

168
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,960
And I didn’t use to like that at all.

169
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,160
I get very angry
when someone talks to me like this.

170
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,640
I am going to kill you.
Power! Father.

171
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,760
Hey!

172
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,440
You haven’t left yet.

173
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,480
Shall I send you a What’s App?

174
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,600
Sorry, sir.

175
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
Sonam, don’t do this.

176
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,040
Then what should I do?

177
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
You swore on the Mother Goddess
that you won’t cheat.

178
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,480
When did I cheat?

179
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,600
I am telling and leaving.

180
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,280
Who leaves like this?

181
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,560
Then how to do this?

182
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,320
This is how you break up.

183
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,760
I love you.

184
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Rajiv, be practical.

185
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,960
Love is not enough to live.

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Couldn’t you tell me
about being practical before.

187
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,160
I wouldn’t have fallen in love
with you.

188
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,280
So, I am telling you now.

189
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,920
I also need financial security.

190
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,240
Can you give that?

191
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,720
Let me try.
I can sell 1 or 2 purifiers.

192
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,280
1 or 2 purifiers won’t
make a difference.

193
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,080
Sonam, don’t speak like that.

194
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,600
Anyway, every drop fills
the pot, right?

195
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,880
Look, I will become old
by the time you pot gets filled.

196
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,440
Sonam, please don’t do this.

197
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,360
Think again.
I had all my hopes on you.

198
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,760
Rajiv! You are such a cry baby!

199
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
It is not crying.
- Enough.

200
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Sonam please.
- Enough. Bye.

201
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
Sonam.

202
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
Gone?

203
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,120
She is angry.

204
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,680
Will she get pacified or not?

205
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,160
My entire life depends on
one purifier.

206
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,440
If this gets sold, I am good.

207
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,040
Otherwise I am done for.

208
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,320
You will be very happy today.

209
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,920
The man who has been
who has been climbing..

210
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,160
..the stairs to your temple
for the last two years.

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,480
The one who comes to pay
homage to you.

212
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,800
The one who is begging you
even today.

213
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
He is still here.

214
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,200
The one who couldn’t sell
a single purifier.

215
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
The one who broke up
with his girlfriend.

216
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,440
The one who couldn’t sell
a single purifier.

217
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,360
The one who broke up
with his girlfriend.

218
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
The one who doesn’t even
have money to pay rent.

219
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,800
On top of that he is almost
about to lose his job.

220
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
What should he do?

221
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,160
Is it my fault that I can’t buy Zara
sandals for my girlfriend?

222
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Is it my fault that I am innocent?

223
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,990
Just give me back my lost love.

224
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,040
And save my job.

225
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,400
Please turn my Friday
into a happy day.

226
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Gunja,
have you got the water bottles?

227
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,680
Yes, ma’am.

228
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,640
We have got more water bottles
than stuff in the house.

229
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,720
Get a new water purifier.

230
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,680
Oh yes.

231
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,960
Yesterday even Mr. Manchanda came..

232
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,280
..and was making fun about this.

233
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
But you know,
that we don’t have the time.

234
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,960
My hubby is busy in theater.

235
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,440
And I am busy with NGO work.

236
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,520
Ma’am.

237
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
Hmm.
- May I say something?

238
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,320
Be careful with your hubby.

239
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,360
Give him some time.

240
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
Otherwise he will start
spending time elsewhere.

241
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,080
My mom used to say that
men are like buckets.

242
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,960
They only need water to get filled.

243
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,240
It can be from the well or the river.

244
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,880
My hubby is not like that.

245
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,990
We had a love marriage.

246
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,720
So, there is no suspicion
where there is love.

247
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,280
And my Gagan is unique
in the world.

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,240
This is the rule of love
which is still not within rules.

249
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,320
Usually love is never successful.

250
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,840
But this love might
have been successful..

251
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,240
..if it was not between
a prince and a maid.

252
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,400
Awesome.

253
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,320
Wife, he acts well.

254
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
I had never thought that
royalty and servitude..

255
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,760
..will reach such a situation.

256
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,160
I want to kiss this land..

257
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
..which..

258
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,960
..introduced me to my love.

259
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
I salute the air and the wind here.

260
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,880
Please accept my salutations.

261
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,360
Is this audience bereft of admirers?

262
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,160
There are no whistles or claps.

263
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,560
So, tell me emperor of India.

264
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,920
What punishment have you
decided for this lover?

265
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
Is there any hope for pardon or not?

266
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,920
The criminals of love
are not pardoned..

267
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,040
..they are punished, Sheku.

268
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,600
Shekhu.
- Sheku.

269
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,680
Shekhu. Shekhu. Shekhu. Shekhu.

270
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,720
Sheku.

271
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,560
What? Go ahead.

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,360
What a cheap Akbar?

273
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,990
He cannot even say Shekhu properly?

274
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,640
Sorry, emperor.

275
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,280
Love is no crime.

276
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
It is.

277
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,120
When it doesn’t care about anyone..

278
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,080
..is shameless and out of control.
Sheku.

279
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,200
Love is worship for lovers.

280
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,080
They don’t care about all this.

281
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,320
In such a case there is
no chance of control..

282
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,280
..and carelessness
Jalaluddin Mohammed Akbar.

283
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
Sheku.

284
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
You must be thinking
that the one who always..

285
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,640
..used to call you father
is now calling you..

286
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,880
..Jalaluddin Mohammed Akbar

287
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,240
Damn. He forgot the last dialogue.

288
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,640
Sheku, that was my dialogue.

289
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,280
It was.
I was hungry.

290
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,040
I ate it like I was having food.

291
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,400
Sheku, how dare you?

292
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,920
Love without daring is nothing.

293
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,240
Sheku.

294
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
Don’t use so much effort.

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,400
The pressure from your belly
will end somewhere else.

296
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,560
And then even the doctor
won’t be able to help the emperor.

297
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,760
And the one who won’t clap
will be punished by God.

298
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,760
Your punishment is that...

299
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,120
You want to say that
I should be made..

300
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,990
..to ride a fair mule or eaten
like sweet Paan.

301
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,720
Put me in the cage of tigers
or make me fight with bulls.

302
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,880
Don’t eat the dialogues
of other characters.

303
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,990
You won’t be able to digest them.

304
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,320
You will have a stomach upset.

305
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,520
I won’t.
I know how to turn liquid into solid.

306
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,080
And you are just playing my dad.
Don’t try to be my real dad.

307
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,880
I will cut your payment.
You won’t get any money, rascal.

308
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Princess, is this how...
- One speaks to his father?

309
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,960
Is this what you want to say?

310
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,560
I only had 1.5 dialogues.

311
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,120
You could have spared that.

312
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,440
This is the caste
and the religion of a lover.

313
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,520
Lover.

314
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,760
How can spare that?

315
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,760
I will throw this sword and kill him.

316
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,360
Where is my lover.

317
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,320
I want to see her.

318
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,880
Guard, go.

319
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,160
Get Anarkali and bring her
to the emperor.

320
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,680
Listen.
- Everyone be careful.

321
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,400
Beautiful.

322
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,640
Fresh.

323
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,360
Soft.
Very colorful.

324
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,480
Anarkali needs to be produced
before the emperor.

325
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,800
Go.

326
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,800
He is spoiling everything.

327
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,400
You have dyed your hair.

328
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,520
Shut up.

329
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,800
My prince.

330
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,640
My love.

331
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,920
I am your...
- Anarkali.

332
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,400
Juhikali.

333
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,720
Sheku!
Stay within your limits.

334
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,840
I think a lover failed
in his love again.

335
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,990
Sheku!

336
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,720
You cannot love Anarkali
when I am here.

337
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,320
Fine. You may.

338
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,400
Wow.

339
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Akku.
- Sheku.

340
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,880
What, Sheku? Sheku?

341
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,360
Should I listen to you
or care about myself?

342
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,040
Punish her and get rid of her.

343
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,040
Anarkali needs to be
buried in the wall.

344
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,880
Which wall?

345
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,880
Bathroom wall or kitchen wall?

346
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,560
Mine.
- Akku!

347
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,680
Sheku!

348
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,320
You have watched my play
40 times in four months.

349
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,920
Don’t you feel bored?

350
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,800
I come to see you.
Not the play.

351
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,400
If you have a plan,
then I won’t come from tomorrow.

352
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,240
How can you stop coming?

353
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,520
You will have to come.
- Is it?

354
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,720
By the way, I was thinking of
acting with you in your play.

355
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
It will be fun, right?

356
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,320
You are my inspiration.

357
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,760
Why do you need to act?

358
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
You have got an answer
to everything. Right?

359
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,200
For you.
- Oh.

360
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,280
Sir, order please.

361
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,720
Dear, it’s a restaurant
not the court.

362
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,360
You find lovers here not criminals.

363
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,400
Not order.
Take a request for a coffee.

364
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,400
Sir, hot?

365
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,440
Don’t add oil to a burning fire?

366
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,880
Get cold coffee.

367
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,360
Okay, sir. Thank you.
- Hmm.

368
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,120
I have got a gift for you.

369
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,160
Show me.

370
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
Nice choice.
Not bad.

371
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,200
And for whom is that for?

372
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,800
I have got that for my wife.
- Is it?

373
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,920
Gift for both of us.
- Yes, this is loyalty.

374
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
So, that you have less feeling
of guilt.

375
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
So, that there is no guilty
feeling at all.

376
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,400
Is it?

377
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,120
Yes, she doesn’t even realize
that she had forgotten..

378
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,080
..her husband while
she was busy doing social service.

379
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,800
Jagan,
I think you are getting naughty.

380
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,440
You never give me a chance, hottie.

381
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,320
Come on.

382
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,080
Okay, I am giving you a chance.

383
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,560
Thank you so much, darling.

384
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,000
Look at this.

385
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,520
Please wear this.

386
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,880
What is this?

387
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,800
This is see through.

388
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
The new ideas of husbands nowadays.

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,520
Do you accept it?

390
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,600
Gagan.
Have you lost your mind?

391
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,640
Yes.

392
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,680
What is there to wear in this?

393
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,040
There is a lot to watch.

394
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,520
Once a week it is a must.

395
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
What about Gagan Kapur’s lust?

396
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,240
I am not in the mood.

397
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,560
You are not in the mood?

398
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,440
Should I have a new affair?

399
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,760
Go ahead.

400
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,640
Huh?

401
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,160
Be careful.

402
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,080
You are allowing
something you might regret.

403
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,400
By the way, doesn’t you husband
get you night suits too?

404
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,280
He gets saris, which I don’t wear.

405
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,990
Where did you find such a man?

406
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,080
I always wanted to be married.

407
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,990
So, I received his alliance
when I was in college.

408
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,360
My parents said that
he is a policeman.

409
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
You will be happy.

410
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,400
So, I got married.

411
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,800
I thought he will be a sexy cop. Hot.

412
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,760
Then?

413
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,480
Forget sexy.

414
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,560
Even my elder uncle looks
younger than him.

415
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,440
Bindu. This is your surprise.

416
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,240
So, this is your surprise?

417
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
You have got me here to see graves.

418
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,000
Not graves, Bindu.

419
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,480
There are mausoleums.

420
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,280
And these don’t belong to lay people.

421
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,560
These are royal mausoleums.

422
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,040
This is Feroz Shah’s mausoleum.

423
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,640
He was buried here.

424
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,240
You know he got his mausoleum
built before his death.

425
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,520
I don’t like this.

426
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,680
Why?

427
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,360
Even I am elder to you.

428
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,760
Gagan.

429
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
You are different.

430
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,720
Why? Do I have horns?

431
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,760
Shh. Don’t joke.

432
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,880
I like talking to you a lot.

433
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,120
I like spending time with you.

434
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,640
I feel very energetic with you.

435
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,440
How long will you continue
watching the play?

436
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,520
Will you ever complete
that screenplay?

437
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Is it?
- Yes.

438
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,720
Sir, your bill.

439
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,920
Rascal, meet me outside.
- Sorry, sir. Sorry.

440
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,600
Sir, please listen.

441
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,160
No. No.

442
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,080
Bro.

443
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,200
This is too much.

444
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,720
Nothing is going good.
- Rajiv sir. What should I get?

445
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,360
Get me some poison.

446
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,160
Why are you joking? Tell me.
What should I get?

447
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,080
You have noodles, right?
Get some noodles and feed me.

448
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,200
Okay. Anything to drink?

449
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,600
No, just get me some plain water.

450
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,160
No more plain water for you.
- Why?

451
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,880
Because from now I will
serve you Pavitra water.

452
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
From your company.

453
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,680
I got it from Sameer sir, yesterday.

454
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,000
Bunty.
- Yes.

455
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,160
Tell me, something.

456
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,800
How much those your noodles cost?

457
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,400
Sir, 40 rupees. But what happened?

458
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,280
And how many do I eat in a month?

459
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,560
Around 20. But what happened?

460
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,360
So how many do I eat in a month.

461
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,280
240. But what happened?

462
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,240
Your noodles cost 40 rupees and I have eaten 240 plates.

463
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
Then how much have paid you?

464
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,990
Sir, 9,600. But what happened?

465
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,440
Rascal, if I made you earn 9,600..

466
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,160
..can’t you make me earn 8,000?

467
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,800
Couldn’t you buy the purifier from me?

468
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,080
Sir, calm down.
I will get a cold drink.

469
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,680
I don’t want a cold drink. Get lost.

470
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,960
Sir. Sir, don’t get angry. Don’t be cross.

471
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,480
Don’t be cross?
I am not cross.

472
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,600
I will get it uninstalled.
I will get it uninstalled.

473
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Uninstall it.

474
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,920
Sir, leave it.
- Okay, stop.

475
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,240
Sir, Sameer forced us...
- Once it gets spoiled..

476
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,240
..then buy the new one from me.

477
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,760
I will get it from you. But Sameer
forced me to buy it in half the price.

478
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,960
What can I do?

479
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,720
Today complimentary noodles for you.

480
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,800
Please, sir.

481
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,440
Prepare noodles for sir.

482
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,400
Hello.

483
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,600
Hi.

484
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,720
You look like a salesman.

485
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,920
You are a good observer.

486
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,880
Do you know Manchanda?

487
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,040
No, sir. I haven’t got his number yet.

488
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,160
Meet him quickly.

489
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,440
He will make you confident
over the phone.

490
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:51,320
Manchanda is someone
who can point you to your success.

491
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,120
Hail Mother Goddess.

492
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,080
Hail Father God.

493
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,160
Friends,
I don’t get rid of your co-wives.

494
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,320
Neither do I teach you to
forget your old love.

495
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,840
I am neither a specialist
in hypnotism.

496
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,880
I am also not a gold medalist
of black magic, etc.

497
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,200
But that thing called money.

498
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
What is it called?

499
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Money.

500
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,080
Damn.
You will get more if you shout louder.

501
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,480
Money!
- Good. Good.

502
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,600
Sir, what will a person with
low confidence do here?

503
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,120
Damn.

504
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,640
The one who has lost confidence
finds Manchanda.

505
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,920
Who loses it?

506
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,480
A person who is betrayed in love.

507
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,440
The one who gets scolded
from the boss..

508
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,760
..and receives an ultimatum.

509
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,360
You also lose it if your friend
takes over your business.

510
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,240
At this the face of a person
looks like rolled out pastry.

511
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,160
Sir, why are we talking about pastry?

512
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Damn.

513
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,080
Look around you.

514
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,080
Look at yourself.

515
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,840
You are pastry.
Rolled and misshapen.

516
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,840
Look. Look.

517
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,080
The way one cannot be
Gandhi just by wearing a Dhoti.

518
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,640
The one dancing to ‘Chikni Chameli’
doesn’t become Katrina.

519
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,640
In the same way, a person
cannot become a salesman..

520
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,600
..by just wearing formal
western clothes.

521
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,000
Hey red headed, purple shirt.
Come here.

522
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,800
Come here.
Wait here. Come here.

523
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,960
I can recognize unsuccessful eyes
from afar.

524
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
You need it a lot, son.

525
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,040
Do one thing.

526
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,400
Meet me alone.

527
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,240
Okay?
Do you understand me?

528
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,800
What is that?

529
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Smile.

530
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,640
That’s it.
It is very important to wear a smile.

531
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,920
Whether you wear a tie or not.

532
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,480
You need wear your smile.

533
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,080
Start applying everything
that I am telling you immediately.

534
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,920
Are you smiling or crying?

535
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,160
That is how my face is like?

536
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,640
Change it.
- My face?

537
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
No.

538
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,800
Smile.

539
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,680
Ramsay’s pretty ghost.
Correct your lips.

540
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,080
Mosquito.

541
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,760
That’s it.
Hold it. Hold it.

542
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,320
Just like this. Sweet and innocent.

543
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,520
Enchant everyone.
Just enchant everyone.

544
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
How, sir?

545
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,720
I haven’t sold a single purifier.

546
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
What is written here?

547
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,640
Ship?

548
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,160
Relationship.

549
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,990
Have you forgotten, crazy guy?

550
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,080
Call the ignorant, intelligent.

551
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,840
Call the fools, wise. The wisest.

552
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,800
Yes.

553
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
Start complimenting
as soon as you see them.

554
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,120
Nice shirt.
Nice shoes.

555
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,840
Nice bag.
Nice hair.

556
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,440
Uncle, grandpa, grand dad.
Everything.

557
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,680
If she is a girl then say, sister.

558
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,080
Once you have established
a relationship..

559
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,480
..your product will get sold.

560
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,400
I can never form relationships, sir.

561
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,480
Even Punam has broken up with me.

562
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,800
You are in love.

563
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,640
Do you have her pic or deleted it?

564
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,720
So nice.
Looks like a brand.

565
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,360
What was the last thing she asked for?
- Me?

566
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,240
Why will you ask?
What did she ask for?

567
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,360
Sandals from Zara.

568
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,480
That’s it.

569
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,400
Become a greater Zara than Zara.

570
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,760
Then watch. The girl will be yours.

571
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
The sandal will be yours.

572
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,680
And Zara will be yours too.

573
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,320
You mean I can get Punam?

574
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,520
Punam?

575
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Alia, Padukone.

576
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Even Anushka.

577
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,920
They were right.

578
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,320
If someone holds your finger,
just hold on to his shoulder.

579
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,000
Correct.

580
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,160
Act smart.
Don’t be over smart.

581
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
Too much will create obstacles.

582
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,840
Just use the butter you can eat.

583
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,440
Don’t use more butter than required.

584
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,720
Got it?

585
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,280
Tell me, how much money do you have?

586
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,360
Sir, you are just like God.

587
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,280
No. No. I am not God.

588
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,920
I am a retired salesman.

589
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,680
Always a salesman.

590
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
Sir, you said you will
also give me a client tip.

591
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,440
I just gave you my last 5000.

592
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,560
Here.

593
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,040
Bela Gagan Kapoor.

594
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,080
They don’t have a purifier.

595
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,120
They served me water
in bottles last time.

596
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,520
She had a brother.

597
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,760
He has left now.

598
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,920
Where did he go?

599
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,480
He just went on and on.

600
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,320
So, whenever you call them up
or go to their home..

601
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,720
..what will you call yourself?

602
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,990
Gappu.
- Correct.

603
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,040
But sir, I am going to sell
the first purifier of my life.

604
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,480
And I am starting with a lie.

605
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,440
You have caused
a huge problem for me.

606
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Hello, great soul.

607
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,800
Have us seen the 67th episode
of the Mahabharata?

608
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
No.
- What does Arjuna tell Krishna?

609
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,680
They are all my cousins and uncles.

610
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,080
How do I kill them?
What did Krishna say?

611
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
Just do your work.

612
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,960
Separate work from religion.

613
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,720
This is where you will do your duty.

614
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,440
You will have to do your duty.

615
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,880
Sir, from now I won’t sell a purifier
to any of my customers.

616
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,280
Why?
- Sir, I will sell..

617
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,960
..purifiers to my relatives.

618
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,160
I will sell purifiers
to the entire world.

619
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,960
The entire world will
only have my purifiers.

620
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,040
I will make my own mark.

621
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,480
The entire world will have my mark.

622
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,280
Hail the man with the mark.

623
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,280
Hello.
You are a salesman.

624
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,040
Don’t become a soldier.

625
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,320
Trying to make marks.

626
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,600
Sir, you don’t know
what you have done to me.

627
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,760
You have just recharged me
with energy.

628
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,680
Currently my body is engulfed
with energy.

629
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,280
Look at my arm.
I have got goosebumps.

630
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,480
I have got goosebumps on my legs.

631
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,440
I have got...
- Enough. Enough. Enough.

632
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,920
Enough. Enough. Enough.

633
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,120
It is not good, to become naked
without any reason.

634
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,240
Call, Bela. Gappu, call Bela.

635
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,360
Come on. Hurry. Call Bela.

636
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Tea.
- Very good. Very good.

637
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,600
Have you added lemon?
- Yes.

638
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,800
Have you added honey?
- Yes, I have.

639
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,120
Cinnamon.
- I have added that too.

640
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,600
Good morning, ma’am.
Sorry sister. Is this Ms. Bela?

641
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,360
Yes, this is Bela. Who are you?

642
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,800
This is Rajiv,
from Pavitra Pani Purifier.

643
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,280
Mr. Manchanda had given me
your reference.

644
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,160
You need a purifier at home, right?

645
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,120
We do need a purifier.

646
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,400
But actually the water supply
here emits hard water.

647
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,360
Sister, the water of the world
has become hard now.

648
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,480
Then make a purifier
for the entire world.

649
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,960
The purifier is ready, sister.
It just needs to get installed.

650
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,520
You talk nicely. What is your name?

651
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,960
My name is Rajiv.
But my pet name is Gappu.

652
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,400
Sister. Hello?
Sister, are you there?

653
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,800
Nothing.
Even I had a brother, Gappu.

654
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,760
He passed away.

655
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
Oh, I am so sorry, sister.

656
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,120
That’s why
when I was talking to you..

657
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,480
..I felt like I was talking
to my sister.

658
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,480
Listen, come on Monday
and install the purifier.

659
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,960
Sister, I have some personal
problem on Monday.

660
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,080
Sister, I will be frank with you.

661
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,640
Actually, my boss has given me
a deadline till Friday.

662
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,040
I need to sell and
install a purifier.

663
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,480
So, if I don’t install it,
I will lose my job.

664
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,040
I have a meeting
at the Ngo tomorrow.

665
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,960
And even my husband
won’t be at home.

666
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,640
And I am going to Shimla
the next day.

667
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,400
Oh, so sister, what should we do now?

668
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,360
Okay listen.

669
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,840
Come the day after tomorrow.
On Friday.

670
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,040
I won’t be there.
But my husband will be home.

671
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,400
Tell him, that I have sent you.

672
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,000
And you can come
and install the purifier.

673
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,200
Perfect, sister.
That is great.

674
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,440
Tell brother-in-law,
that Gappu will come..

675
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,280
..and install the purifier.

676
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,240
I will go and fit
everything well, sister.

677
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,680
And once you are back,
I want to meet you, sister.

678
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
And I want you to tie me
a Rakhi this time.

679
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360
For sure.
- Okay, Rajiv.

680
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,640
Sis, I am Rajiv for strangers.

681
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,280
You can call me Gappu.

682
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,800
And your brother will fight
with the world for you.

683
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,200
Don’t worry.
And sis, you are going to Shimla.

684
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,200
It is very cold there.
Take warm covers.

685
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,640
Be careful of the cold.

686
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,640
You take care
and have a great journey, sis.

687
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,680
All the best.

688
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,880
Okay, Gappu. Thank you.

689
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,440
Bye, sis. Bye.

690
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,160
Hello. Hey. Where are you going?

691
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,760
Tomorrow our NGO
has a medical camp in Shimla.

692
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,920
I need to leave in the morning.

693
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,240
You don’t even tell me.

694
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,040
We are not able to give time
to each other nowadays.

695
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,240
For us to discuss anything.

696
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,240
Go to sleep. Good night.

697
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Oh no.

698
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,480
I need to wake up early
in the morning.

699
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,400
Wow! Blue color T-shirt.

700
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,800
What a nice color.
I mean it is my favorite color.

701
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,480
Forget me. Even my sister’s
favorite color is blue.

702
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,760
And even you are like my sister.

703
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,320
Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro.

704
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,080
You remember that you need
to pay rent in 2 days?

705
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,360
Sandi, don’t bother me.
Today is Friday.

706
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,360
If I don’t sell a purifier today
I will get sacked.

707
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,560
And lose Punam too.

708
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,680
You lost Punam?

709
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
Why haven’t you told me?

710
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Let’s get some beer. Party.
We will have fun.

711
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,480
Are you mad?

712
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,720
Have you lost your mind?

713
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,960
Anyway, you don’t deserve Punam.

714
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,800
You used to go around
with a babe, bro.

715
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,560
And we used to face
the inconvenience.

716
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,080
My hands would...
I mean my heart used to be in pain.

717
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,320
Listen. She is your sister-in-law.

718
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,800
Hey!
Hey!

719
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,280
Hello, sir.
A very sweet good morning.

720
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,400
No need to be so sweet. Speak.

721
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,160
Sir, firstly this shirt is very nice.

722
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,990
It looks so good on you.

723
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,280
You look very young and smart.

724
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,600
Really?
- Yes, sir.

725
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,400
Sir, you look like a
very successful businessman.

726
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,040
Is it?

727
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,360
And I wanted to tell you that
I am going to install..

728
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,360
..a purifier today.

729
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Yes.

730
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,720
Make sure you do.

731
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,080
You have got one day left.

732
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,520
Nothing is impossible.

733
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,040
If you believe in yourself,
then purifier is nothing.

734
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,040
If Bhagirath can bring Ganga
from heaven..

735
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,120
..then can’t Rajiv Chabbra
sell purifiers?

736
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,720
You have become very wise
in a single day.

737
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,560
Have you got along with
any religious men?

738
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,040
No, sir. This is enlightenment.

739
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,520
Okay, sir. I will take your leave.

740
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,320
And I will come back with the check.

741
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,760
Yes, make sure you get the check.

742
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,320
Otherwise the enlightenment
will get extinguished.

743
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,040
Don’t worry about it, sir.

744
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,280
You have a very nice day.
And I will see you in the evening.

745
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,960
Sir, can I get you coffee?

746
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,400
Bhaskar. Get a milk coffee for sir.

747
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,480
See you, sir.

748
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,560
What just happened?

749
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,960
What happened?
You look very happy.

750
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,960
It is necessary to wear a smile.

751
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,400
Even if you don’t wear a tie or not.

752
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,560
What?
- Good day.

753
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,640
What is wrong with him?

754
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,440
Take care of yourself.
I will come tomorrow.

755
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,680
Are you sure that you will
only come tomorrow?

756
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,240
What do you mean?

757
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,440
I mean, take your own time darling.

758
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,680
And if you get a hiccup,
then it’s me who is missing you.

759
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,760
So cute.

760
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Listen, take care of the house.

761
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,200
And rehearse well for the show.

762
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,440
I will rehearse like
I have never done before.

763
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,960
Bye.
- Bye.

764
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,800
You go. And she will come.

765
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,480
She will come. And we will do it.

766
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,990
Sunny.

767
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,280
Come to C42 in Greater Kailash.

768
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,920
Yes, bro. Don’t be late.

769
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,080
I am selling my purifier after a
long time after many hardships.

770
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,320
How romantic.

771
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,440
Don’t just watch the maiden
with the beautiful eyes.

772
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,920
Start making love.

773
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
Don’t think so much.

774
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,720
You talk so interestingly.
- I even do interesting work.

775
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,400
Just allow me.

776
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Gagan, I am thirsty.
Get me some water.

777
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,800
Should I serve you with my eyes.
Or my lips?

778
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,040
If you want I will become a pot
and serve you water.

779
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,040
Wow.

780
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,680
You love me so much?

781
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,240
So much, that there is
water in the ocean.

782
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,320
Love like Romeo. I promise.

783
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,320
Where is the water?

784
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,320
From the sea to the bottle.

785
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,640
Purifier is broken.
Need to have it replaced.

786
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,800
Okay.

787
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Is your thirst quenched?

788
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,840
Yes.
- But not mine.

789
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,040
Gagan, are we doing
something wrong?

790
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,240
One must do such thing when young.

791
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,760
Otherwise what sins will
we repent for when we are old?

792
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,160
All right.

793
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,560
Isn’t that good?

794
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,520
Me too.

795
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,120
(bell ringing)

796
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,920
Is it your wife?

797
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,480
She said that she will come
tomorrow not today.

798
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,320
She can’t break my trust.

799
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,960
Who is it now?

800
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,200
Hey, two wheeler.
Why are you charging inside?

801
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,880
I have always charges
like this since years.

802
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,080
But you have never stopped me.

803
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
But you have come
at the wrong time today.

804
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,280
This is not right.

805
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,800
Sir, I have come at the right time.

806
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,320
Look, its 10 o’clock.
- But today is your holiday.

807
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,600
Go and have fun.
- I already had fun yesterday.

808
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,360
So, I won’t take a holiday today.

809
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
Ma’am will scold me
if I don’t clean up.

810
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,280
I will see to the cleaning.

811
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,200
Sir, I need to water the plants.
- Leave that to me.

812
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,600
Sir, I need to wash clothes.
- Leave that to me.

813
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,080
So, kind?

814
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,320
I am sure there is some secret.

815
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,240
Devil’s granny.

816
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,720
The royal servant.

817
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,240
What will do I at home now?

818
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Celebrate some festival.

819
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,480
If there was some festival today..

820
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,160
..I would have been decked up.
- Then celebrate Diwali.

821
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,240
If it was Diwali I would
have been a bomb today.

822
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,840
Then celebrate your birthday.
- That’s gone now.

823
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,560
Then celebrate your kid’s birthday.
- It is around the corner.

824
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,480
Good.
Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave.

825
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,800
Bindu.

826
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,880
The one who had come has left.

827
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,120
But you should come outside.

828
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,080
Bindu.

829
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,040
Bindu.

830
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,920
Come outside.

831
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,680
Bindu.

832
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,720
What is this, Bindu?

833
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,920
That’s my arm.

834
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,160
That is what keeps me together.

835
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,240
And what is this Bindu?

836
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,760
My legs.

837
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,160
They are no strangers.

838
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,800
What is this Bindu.

839
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,200
My waist.

840
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,840
I was looking at that only.

841
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,320
What is this Bindu?

842
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
My cheek.

843
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,600
They are just gorgeous.

844
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,520
You are just gorgeous.

845
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,840
If you are done playing
hide and seek then...

846
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,120
(Bell ringing)

847
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,990
Is this your wife?

848
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,800
I told you.

849
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,840
She can’t break my trust.

850
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,360
Go and hide.

851
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,120
Hello, sir. I am Honey.

852
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,200
So, shall I lick?

853
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
No, sir. My name is Honey.

854
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,520
Then tell me that.

855
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,560
Sir, we are from
the Pulse Polio program.

856
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,440
Do you have any small kid
in your house?

857
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,990
Give me a chance.
And I will have many kids.

858
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,880
Sir, I am already married.

859
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,040
But yes, she is a spinster.

860
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,360
Hey, will you give him a chance.
Oh no. Manoj will feel bad.

861
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,600
Let Manoj feel bad.

862
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,520
And you can get remarried.

863
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,800
And please leave me alone.

864
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,280
Bindu.

865
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,800
Bindu.

866
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,800
Bindu. Come outside.

867
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,320
Bindu.

868
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,120
One cannot make love
by hiding inside the curtains.

869
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,160
To make love you need
a man’s chest, strong arms..

870
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,760
..and the heart of a lady.

871
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,720
Bindu.

872
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,560
Bindu, shall I close my eyes?

873
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:10,080
I cannot look away from your face.

874
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,600
How can I see the scenery?

875
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,880
Hey!

876
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,040
Who are you?

877
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Guess.

878
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Thief?

879
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,200
Not a thief. Stealer of hearts.

880
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Why have you come here?

881
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,200
To wait.

882
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,960
For whom?

883
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,240
For a chance.

884
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,960
Chance?

885
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,800
I don’t understand.

886
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Chance to steal.

887
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,440
Meanwhile you are taking full
advantage of your opportunity.

888
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,880
How much have you seen?

889
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,990
Everything.

890
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,480
What do you mean?

891
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,680
Each and every scene.

892
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,600
Me?

893
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
She?

894
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,990
In spite of being a thief
you are behaving..

895
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,960
..as if I am the thief
and you are the master.

896
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,320
Have you got any tools?

897
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
Only mobile.

898
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,760
Oh yeah.
- Yes.

899
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,280
Shall I call the police?

900
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,240
Of course. Why not?

901
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,440
Call the police.

902
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,800
I think you don’t know
much about Delhi police.

903
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,720
They will investigate one
and create files for three.

904
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,240
Take this.

905
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,800
Dial 100.

906
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,120
Maybe besides me
they will find a thief here.

907
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,990
A thug.
A party goer.

908
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,640
A cheat.

909
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,920
And a betrayer.

910
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,360
Everyone will be amazed.

911
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,990
2 free with 1.

912
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,480
Gagan, please.

913
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,760
No police please.

914
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,240
Then call the army.
- Huh?

915
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,720
Call CID Pradyuman Singh.

916
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,400
ACP.

917
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,840
Nothing of that sort will happen.

918
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,480
Everything will happen
as per your wish.

919
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,680
All thieves are brothers.

920
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,960
You are my younger brother.

921
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,800
I am your elder brother.

922
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,720
Elder?

923
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,920
One moment.

924
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,120
How old are you?

925
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,200
Oh.

926
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,520
I am little older.
I am 44.

927
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,240
Oh.
- Oh.

928
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,600
I am the elder.

929
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,990
You are the younger.

930
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,600
Fine. Fine.

931
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,120
Just take whatever you want.
- No.

932
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,400
Just steal whatever you want to.
- Thank you.

933
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,840
Consider this your home.
- Gagan.

934
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,160
Stealing at your own home?
Very bad.

935
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,360
Call the police.
- No. No. No. No.

936
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,120
Why are you listening to her?
Please. Just do your work.

937
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,200
Okay?
- Yes. Go and steal.

938
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,560
Thank you.
- Good luck.

939
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,360
Please, nobody disturb me.

940
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,520
I am proud of you.

941
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,080
Thanks.
- Go.

942
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,990
Gagan.

943
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,400
Hmm.

944
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,840
Hmm.

945
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,640
(Bell ringing)

946
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,360
Hide in the bathroom.

947
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,240
What?

948
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,160
Are you crazy!
What if the thief came?

949
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,640
He is a thief not a plumber
to get inside the bathroom.

950
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,960
But I am scared.

951
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,080
So, am I enjoying here?
Even I am scared.

952
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,640
Gagan.
- Please.

953
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,040
(Bell ringing.)

954
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,120
Coming.

955
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,600
Who are you, bro?

956
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,640
Brother.
- But whose?

957
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,840
Sister Bela’s brother.

958
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,480
So, I am your brother-in-law.

959
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,960
Bela’s cousin has already
passed away.

960
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,800
When were you born?

961
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,360
Gappu. Same thing...
- This is not done.

962
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,440
Who are you?

963
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,960
Sorry, you are my brother-in-law.
So, I need to touch your feet.

964
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,560
So, I need to touch your feet.

965
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,360
Have you forgotten where my feet are?

966
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,120
Either you bow down
or I will bring my feet up.

967
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,800
It’s a good joke. So funny...
- It’s not so funny.

968
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,680
Who are you?
Explain.

969
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,760
Explain.
- Actually, sister Bela called.

970
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,440
She was talking to me.

971
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,800
And then I found out that
your purifier is broken.

972
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,400
So, I said that I will install
a new one.

973
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,720
Anyway, I can never refuse sis Bela.

974
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,200
Bela called you?

975
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,720
Yes.

976
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,240
Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

977
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,080
Hi, I am Rajiv Chabbra.
I am calling from..

978
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,560
I mean I am not calling from...

979
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,000
I am from PP Purifier.

980
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,560
And that stands for
Pavitra Pani Purifier.

981
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,600
You know our RO technology
is very modern.

982
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,600
With 20liters of water storage.

983
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,990
Plus 80 liters of water storage
for the bathroom.

984
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
Do you know what the best thing
about our water purifiers?

985
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,840
Brother-in-law,
the thing is the lights won’t glow..

986
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,080
..if you are not using water.

987
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,990
Because your home is like our home.
It’s the same.

988
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,280
By the way, brother-in-law,
what a nice T shirt.

989
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,600
Maroon.

990
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,240
Must be sister’s choice.

991
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,680
Hey! Keep your sister safe with you.

992
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,360
otherwise I will hang you
with your tie from the terrace.

993
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,920
And people will ring your bell.

994
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,680
What are you staring at?

995
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,520
Your phone is ringing.
It might be Bela.

996
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,640
Yes Sunny, where are you?

997
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,120
I told you to come to
greater Kailash.

998
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,480
Why are you in Kailashdham?
Are you mad?

999
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,520
I sent you the location.

1000
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,720
Hey.
- I will pay the extra. Hurry up now.

1001
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,160
Whom are you calling
without asking me?

1002
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,640
It is Sunny, brother-in-law.
He drills holes.

1003
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,880
What brother-in-law...
- One moment.

1004
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,560
Brother-in-law ship is a very
two faced relationship.

1005
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,480
Like head and tails.
Anil Kapoor and Mr. India.

1006
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,400
Modi and his friends.
All are the same.

1007
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,040
Hey you stupid moron.
Unwanted insect.

1008
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,440
Are you leaving,
or shall I throw you out?

1009
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,960
Brother-in-law!
How?

1010
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,160
How? I mean how do you do that?
- But what do I do?

1011
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,920
You are insulting me better than..

1012
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,440
..anyone has ever praised me.

1013
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,240
How can you be happy with insults?

1014
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,800
Skinless hippo.
Courtyard without a terrace.

1015
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,720
If you use your sales tactics
anymore..

1016
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,920
..that I will punch you so hard..

1017
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,560
..that you will break down
into your primary elements.

1018
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,960
Get out from here. Get out.

1019
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,960
Get out.

1020
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,120
The world is wrong.

1021
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,990
The wife’s brother is more than
the entire creation.

1022
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,440
You are not letting me do
what I want to.

1023
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,400
I had already filled the form.

1024
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,800
I was about to sign it when
you came in with your face.

1025
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,880
No. No. No. No. No.
Not my nose. I have a cold.

1026
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,040
Hey. You don’t have cold.

1027
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,760
Hey!
You haven’t even moved your mouth.

1028
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,960
Where did the sound come from?

1029
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,240
God bless you.

1030
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,560
Thank you.

1031
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,360
I think you care cleaning up.

1032
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,760
Full clean.
- Why do you care what is going on?

1033
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,920
Get out from here. Leave.

1034
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Brother-in-law, this is wrong.

1035
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,200
How can you insult me
in front of a servant?

1036
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,800
You trespasser. Unwanted creep.

1037
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,200
I have been insulting
since you have come.

1038
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,400
And you have understood it now.
You...

1039
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,990
You can resume your work.

1040
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,160
Am I disturbing you?

1041
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,960
Please do it.

1042
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,320
Come on. Get out.

1043
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,920
I can’t understand
how can my sweet sister..

1044
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,240
..have such a cruel husband?

1045
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,720
If you can’t understand, then don’t.

1046
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,080
Brother-in-law,
you are just talking like my papa.

1047
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,800
This is how my papa used to
speak to my mom.

1048
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,560
He used to scold her so much.

1049
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,840
Hey!

1050
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,160
Brother-in-law, sis is home
and you haven’t even told me.

1051
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,640
Sister. Sis!

1052
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,200
By the way, Brother-in-law.

1053
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,560
How can you be so romantic
so early in the morning?

1054
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,560
The way your dad used to.

1055
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,920
You are just like a boiled egg.

1056
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,680
Hard from the outside.
Soft from the inside.

1057
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,960
And even softer
when we delve deeper inside.

1058
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,440
And you are like omelet
which is stuck on all sides.

1059
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,200
There is only some yolk
in the middle.

1060
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,160
You are so funny, Brother-in-law.

1061
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,480
It is not so funny.

1062
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,560
I am very happy today
that my sister..

1063
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,520
..is in such a safe and secure
environment.

1064
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,990
I mean, thank god,
that you are not like my papa.

1065
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,880
Your papa lost his control
and gave birth to this problem.

1066
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,360
I will never...

1067
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,800
Sister!
Sister! You are inside?

1068
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,960
Hey. Why are you going inside?

1069
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,200
You...
- Sister!

1070
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,960
Bull shit.

1071
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,120
Sister, open the door. Sister.
- Open. Open. Open.

1072
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,320
Gagan.
- What?

1073
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,520
There is a rat.

1074
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,640
You were so scared that I thought..

1075
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,560
..it was a rapist and not a rat.

1076
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,800
Hello sister Bela.

1077
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,920
Who is this?

1078
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,160
Sis, I am Gappu.
I spoke to you over the phone.

1079
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,640
How did you know that she is Bela?

1080
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,990
You have never met her before.

1081
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,640
Obviously, she is hugging you,
so she is bound to be Bela.

1082
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,320
Huh? Yes.

1083
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,800
Sis, greetings.

1084
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,240
I wanted to thank you.

1085
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,800
Everything has turned good,
because of you.

1086
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,440
You are so nice and so good.
She has saved my job.

1087
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,760
But you had left for Shimla.

1088
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,880
Why are you back suddenly?

1089
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,120
Gagan explain.

1090
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,520
Yes, she left.
But then she missed me.

1091
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,440
She returned.

1092
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,360
Mind your own business.
Why do you care?

1093
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,760
That’s cool. One moment.

1094
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,720
Yes, Sunny.
Where are you?

1095
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,520
What is this?
- She thinks you are Bela.

1096
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,680
So, continue with the charade.
Otherwise there will be a problem.

1097
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,990
What is this nonsense? I am leaving.

1098
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,200
People are all thirsty here.
Come fast, Sunny.

1099
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,080
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
- Hey. What are you doing?

1100
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,480
This is not done.
- Sis, what happened? Any problem?

1101
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,440
No, brother, there is no problem.
Go and install the purifier.

1102
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,560
No. No. No. No. Big problem.
Hello, leave that place.

1103
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,240
Brother-in-law, I need to install
the purifier today.

1104
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,720
Please go home.
- I have spoken to sister.

1105
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,640
What is he doing?
- That I will install the purifier.

1106
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,560
Don’t touch me.
He will install it and leave.

1107
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,600
How can he do that? You are asking
him to install the purifier.

1108
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,960
If he stays back to install
the purifier what will we install?

1109
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,240
He is going to install the purifier?

1110
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,160
You called him inside.

1111
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,840
And now you are shouting at me.
Don’t behave like my husband.

1112
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,440
What?
- Hey! Husband! Sis... What...

1113
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,040
I am her husband.

1114
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,240
How is this your business?
Get out.

1115
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,640
But why are you fighting
with me in front of him?

1116
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,040
You are fighting with me
in front of him.

1117
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,080
Hey! Why are you both
fighting in front of me?

1118
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,360
Why do you care?
This is my house.

1119
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,200
My wife.
I can do whatever I want to.

1120
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,760
Stop. Get out.

1121
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,320
My sister won’t go anywhere.

1122
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,800
Brother-in-law, you are behaving..

1123
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,960
..like my papa.
- Papa?

1124
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,600
Even my papa used to talk
like this to my mom.

1125
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,560
Mom?

1126
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,600
You are too much.
I am going to teach you a lesson now.

1127
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,160
I cannot see my mom in trouble.

1128
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,720
Hey! That is a sharp one.
It might wound someone.

1129
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,080
Dad!
- Mom!

1130
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,840
Stop!

1131
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,720
What is going on?

1132
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,760
Look at him?
Who hits a person like him?

1133
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,240
Should I give him the knife instead?

1134
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,440
I will get you now.
- Hey.

1135
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,680
I will get you now.
- He is mad.

1136
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,960
What are you doing?

1137
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,840
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1138
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,160
You cannot do this.

1139
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,640
Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother.

1140
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,600
Let him go.
He is your Brother-in-law.

1141
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,400
Sorry.

1142
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
Sorry, sister.
Sister, I am really sorry.

1143
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,920
I don’t know what had
happened to me.

1144
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,080
That all right.

1145
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,560
Everything will be fine now.

1146
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,440
Once Pavitra Pani is installed
in this house..

1147
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,920
..everything will get fine anyway.

1148
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,680
This is all psychological.
This is not emotional.

1149
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,240
I mean...
- Brother, it is something else.

1150
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,640
You don’t understand.
- He won’t understand either.

1151
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,720
Pavitra Pani! Get out of here.

1152
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,520
Otherwise I will stab you so hard
that you will die for sure.

1153
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,320
Hey you.
- What?

1154
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,440
Get out.

1155
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,760
Bindu. Get out.
- Bindu or Bela?

1156
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,440
Shut up.
How does that matter?

1157
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,320
I will call her whatever I want to.

1158
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,960
I address her as Bindu.
How does that matter to you?

1159
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,440
This is the problem.

1160
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,000
If you address sister with
new names..

1161
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,800
..then I am bound to face problems.

1162
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,120
That is the case.

1163
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,760
What the hell do you have to
do here?

1164
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,440
Get out.
Hey! Get out.

1165
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,400
Otherwise I will kill you.
- Kill me.

1166
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,560
Kill me. Kill me. Finish me off.

1167
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,640
I am becoming crazy.

1168
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,760
I cannot see my sister’s home
getting broken.

1169
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,720
I can even die for my sister.
Kill me.

1170
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,040
Kill me. Kill me.
- No.

1171
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,400
Do you know how he will die?
- No.

1172
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,480
Like this?
Or like this?

1173
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,920
Excuse me.

1174
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,440
I have done my job.

1175
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,400
There is a lot of stuff in the house
and I need a tempo.

1176
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,600
Please, someone help me.

1177
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,200
What is this?

1178
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,520
This is a water purifier.

1179
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,560
Mine is broken.

1180
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,560
Take it with you.

1181
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,720
Very good.

1182
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,640
What is going on, sir?
I mean, what is going on?

1183
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,560
Brother-in-law, who is this man?

1184
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,640
Is he a cleaner or a thief?
How can you just take it?

1185
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,440
It is not your rule.
How can you take it?

1186
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,240
Shut up. Bull shit.
Just shut up.

1187
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,160
Why are you disturbing when
2 great thieves are compromising?

1188
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,720
What did you say?
Who is she to you?

1189
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,920
Sister.

1190
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,000
Sister.

1191
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,160
What is your plan?
- No, please.

1192
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,280
Shall I tell him that you both
belong to other people?

1193
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,200
Hey!

1194
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,040
He is just an innocent child.

1195
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,480
He doesn’t even understand
what the situation is.

1196
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,240
You can understand
the situation well.

1197
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,360
So, just take this entire file.
And fire away.

1198
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,600
My God.
- Sit. Sit.

1199
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,080
First tell me, who are you?

1200
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,000
I am Birju Kalia, corporate thief.

1201
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,990
I don’t hide and steal.

1202
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,840
That’s why I am not scared
of the home owners.

1203
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,640
Brother-in-law, your pride is dead.

1204
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,560
Yours is alive?
- Yes.

1205
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,520
Then you kill him.
- What are you doing?

1206
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,240
He is cracked.
How can you give him orders?

1207
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,360
Crack!

1208
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,480
Thief!

1209
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:28,680
(unintelligible abuses)

1210
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,840
Let me go.

1211
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,200
Not my pant.

1212
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,520
What are you doing? Let him go.

1213
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,040
What are you doing?

1214
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,000
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand.

1215
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,960
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand.

1216
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,880
Thief, let go of my hand.

1217
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,880
You.

1218
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,960
Hands up!
- Sorry.

1219
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,720
Hands up!
- Hey.

1220
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,760
Hands up!

1221
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,200
Shut up.

1222
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,200
Hands up!

1223
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,680
Go ahead. Take this.

1224
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,160
This...

1225
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,000
It is fake.

1226
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,200
Cheating.

1227
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,240
I surrender.

1228
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,920
We will print your calendar.

1229
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,640
Oh God!

1230
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,990
Has he fainted or is he dead?

1231
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,760
You get sentenced for 14 years
and break rocks too.

1232
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,840
Shut up.
Check his breathing.

1233
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,400
I don’t think he is breathing.

1234
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:35,880
Give him mouth to mouth.

1235
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,920
What are you saying?

1236
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,920
Did you notice his mouth?
He chews tobacco.

1237
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,200
Sister, you do it.

1238
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,440
What nonsense.

1239
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,520
Don’t you love Bindu?

1240
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,480
Bindu or Bela?

1241
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,560
If you don’t mind, can you?

1242
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,280
Gagan!
- One moment. Stop fighting.

1243
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,960
Sis, only for you.

1244
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,560
(Bell ringing)

1245
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,840
Who has come?

1246
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,800
I will go and check.
- Sir.

1247
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,520
We need to take care of him too.

1248
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,560
I haven’t done all this before.
- You think I have graduated in this?

1249
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,720
Lift him.

1250
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,880
Stay here.

1251
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,960
I will go and check outside.

1252
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,120
What?

1253
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,960
You took so much time
to open the door.

1254
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,480
This is a door, not your zipper.

1255
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,840
You don’t just unzip it in a go.

1256
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,800
What do you want?

1257
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,080
Sir, I think you were doing
something important.

1258
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,560
Yes.

1259
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,320
I had caught a dacoit.

1260
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,120
I was taking care of his corpse.

1261
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,680
Good joke, sir.

1262
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,720
This courier is for Ms. Bela Kapur.

1263
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,240
Can you call her?

1264
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,120
She has gone outside. Give.

1265
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,200
Sir, I know a lot about you.

1266
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,080
Is it?
- Yes.

1267
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,960
Are you some scholar?

1268
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,200
I have seen your play
which you have enacted 150 times.

1269
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,360
Fine.

1270
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,760
Can I take a selfie with you?

1271
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,880
Not now. Later.

1272
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,920
Please.
- Okay, fine.

1273
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,880
No pout, please.

1274
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,200
Please.
- Nice idea.

1275
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,720
No look, sir.

1276
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,920
Hey.

1277
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,600
Can you see that golden crow?

1278
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,760
I have only seen black crows.

1279
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,200
Scat!

1280
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,240
Who was it?
- Courier.

1281
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,320
Brother-in-law, who is this?

1282
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,600
Since you have asked me.

1283
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,840
So, take it.

1284
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,760
This is my wife.

1285
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,880
Puja.

1286
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,360
Then who is she?

1287
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,160
No, this is my first wife.

1288
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,760
I met her a few days back.

1289
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,480
But where is she?

1290
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,760
Have you ever gone to the Kumbh fair?

1291
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,240
No, but I have heard that
people often get lost there.

1292
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,800
I also lost Puja at the Kumbh fair.

1293
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,520
So, didn’t you look for her?

1294
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,640
A lot.

1295
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,920
But I couldn’t find Puja.

1296
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,760
That’s why you call sister Bela
with different girl names.

1297
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,880
Yes.

1298
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,360
And this is how sister Bela
entered your life.

1299
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,720
Brother-in-law.
- Hmm.

1300
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,200
Brother-in-law.
- What?

1301
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,120
I was thinking of getting in
with someone after Punam.

1302
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,280
Go ahead but leave me alone.

1303
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,990
Sister Bela and you.
Please shake hands.

1304
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,800
Shake hands.
Hold each others’ hands.

1305
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,920
Now hug each other.

1306
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,990
Please, do.

1307
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,990
Hug.

1308
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,160
Gagan.

1309
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,520
Hey you.

1310
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,880
Smoking in front of the hospital?

1311
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,080
My wife is sick. She is inside.

1312
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,600
What happened to her?

1313
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,600
Female disease.

1314
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,990
Female disease.

1315
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,000
It is so expensive...
- How much is this cigarette for?

1316
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,080
10 rupees.
- 10 rupees!

1317
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,480
And how many more do you have?

1318
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,000
One more.
- You have got money to die.

1319
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,990
But you don’t have money to save
your wife from death.

1320
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
What nonsense?

1321
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,880
Look. It says it causes death.

1322
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,360
And this sanitary pad gives life.

1323
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,560
Don’t laugh.

1324
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,400
Price of two cigarettes get
you these sanitary pads..

1325
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,560
..which could have saved
your wife from this dreadful..

1326
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,560
..disease that is caused
because of using..

1327
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,880
..dirty clothes during menstruation.

1328
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,360
And if you don’t smoke
you can also save yourself..

1329
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,680
..from dangerous diseases.

1330
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,120
That means you can buy
two lives with the money..

1331
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,720
..you have been buying death with.

1332
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,760
One for you
and another for your wife.

1333
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,320
Think about it and smile.

1334
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,880
Heroism is not in smoking.

1335
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,320
It is in giving this.

1336
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:48,990
Gagan!

1337
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,560
Sister!

1338
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,640
Brother-in-law,
sister is back from the fair.

1339
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:57,990
What fair?

1340
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:58,990
Kumbh Fair.

1341
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,640
Shut up.

1342
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,280
Gagan, who is this girl?

1343
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Who are you?

1344
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,160
Shall I tell her?
- No. Please.

1345
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,040
I will explain.

1346
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,240
You came.

1347
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,880
And you saw us both stuck together.

1348
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,800
So, you thought that this is it...

1349
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,320
Hmm.

1350
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,360
And not it is proven.

1351
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,800
No wife can see her husband
in another lady’s arms.

1352
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,560
This is no betrayal. This is just
an optical illusion, lady.

1353
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,720
Forget it.

1354
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,280
I asked you, who is this girl.

1355
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,440
Good question.
Wow!

1356
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,040
(Sanskrit)

1357
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,760
What do you mean?

1358
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,800
I mean even god doesn’t
know the character..

1359
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,560
..of a lady and the fate of a man.

1360
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,840
Then how will human know?

1361
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,400
I am asking you, who is this girl.

1362
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,720
Her.

1363
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,520
She is someone’s daughter.

1364
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,000
Someone’s future daughter-in-law.

1365
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,480
And...

1366
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,960
She is a sister.
- Hey!

1367
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,960
Who is this girl?

1368
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,640
Her.

1369
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,360
She is his wife.

1370
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,160
Why don’t you speak?

1371
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,800
I am speechless.

1372
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:31,560
No, you have to give a big speech.

1373
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,160
She is your wife.

1374
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,440
What will he say?

1375
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,360
I will tell you.

1376
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,080
He doesn’t tell anything
since we have got married.

1377
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,720
Look at him moving away.

1378
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,840
Bela, everything was good
while we were having an affair.

1379
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,560
After that, I don’t know
what has happened.

1380
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,960
I don’t know where he is lost.

1381
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,440
You know, he gets milk,
when I ask him for juice.

1382
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,520
He gets curd
when I ask him to get milk.

1383
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,760
And he gets Paneer
when I ask him to get curd.

1384
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,440
I don’t know anything.

1385
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,320
Tell me,
what should I do now, sister?

1386
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,360
Hello, who are you?

1387
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,240
Hmm.
- Tell her.

1388
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,200
Greetings, sister.

1389
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,840
Sister, I am from PP purifier.
To install a purifier.

1390
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,640
We spoke over the phone.
Gappu.

1391
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:24,400
Yes. Okay, you are Gappu.

1392
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,640
You have come to install
the purifier.

1393
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,120
Why is your wife here?

1394
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,560
Why?

1395
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,040
Why did she come?

1396
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,160
Why did she come?
- Because he was not coming.

1397
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,480
Why were you not coming?

1398
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,680
Why should I come?

1399
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,320
You know she fights with me a lot.

1400
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,840
Sis, she had not even
given me breakfast.

1401
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,840
Why don’t you serve him breakfast?

1402
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,480
He has become so thin.

1403
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,240
I was angry with him.

1404
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,640
Why do you make her angry?

1405
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,440
Shall I tell you all my home truths?

1406
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,880
She came along.

1407
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,960
You tell me. You had called her up.

1408
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,560
Me?
- Gagan. Did you call his wife?

1409
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,560
He had come to install the purifier.

1410
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,080
So I said, no, get out.

1411
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,560
But Bela told me to come.

1412
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,160
His name is Gappu.

1413
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,040
I became emotional.

1414
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,440
You know how actors are like.

1415
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,920
You are emotional.

1416
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,840
I said, if you are here to that.

1417
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,880
Wow.

1418
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,120
Gagan.
- Yes.

1419
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,800
He came to install the purifier.

1420
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,640
Why did you call his wife?

1421
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,400
He was quarreling with her
over the phone.

1422
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,880
Shall I go do my job or
stay at home with you?

1423
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,440
So, I said that you are married.
You need to do your duty.

1424
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,680
Like me.

1425
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,720
What is this?

1426
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,680
And she was calling him repeatedly.

1427
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,840
Come home. Come home. Come home.

1428
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,400
Hey! Why were you calling him?

1429
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,560
Because it is our anniversary today.

1430
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,640
But even today he left me alone
and came to work.

1431
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,920
Sit.

1432
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,990
Who does this, sister?

1433
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,480
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

1434
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,120
Is it your anniversary?

1435
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,240
Happy wedding anniversary.

1436
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,120
So sorry.

1437
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,200
It’s your anniversary
and he had to come here.

1438
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,400
But for whom does a husband earn?

1439
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,560
For his wife, right?

1440
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,680
And don’t be angry with him.

1441
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,560
Don’t make him angry either.

1442
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,320
What?

1443
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,080
Nothing at all.
You are correct.

1444
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,080
Another thing.

1445
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,600
Why were you hugging her?

1446
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,680
Bela.

1447
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,920
You are suspicious of your Gagan.

1448
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:39,040
Suspicion is a termite
which eats up a body, mind..

1449
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,560
..and the entire family.

1450
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,040
Gagan, I am sorry.

1451
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,200
I am so sorry.

1452
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,920
Please forgive me.
I suspected you. But...

1453
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,400
It is not your mistake.

1454
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,320
The wives who love their husbands
a lot are suspicious.

1455
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,240
And I will never forget your love.

1456
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,360
I love you.

1457
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,080
I love you.

1458
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,320
I love you.

1459
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,360
But you had left for Shimla.

1460
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,760
How come you are back home?

1461
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,840
Oh. I was driving the car
and talking over the phone.

1462
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,720
An auto came in front of me.

1463
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,360
While trying to save him,
I crashed into a tempo.

1464
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,280
He is waiting for me.

1465
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,240
I need to take
my driving license and RC.

1466
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,800
You had an accident.

1467
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,920
Are you hurt?

1468
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,040
No, I am fine.

1469
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,280
I am fine.

1470
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,720
Please help me.
Look here. I will find inside.

1471
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,040
Okay.
- Gappu. Bindu. Just feel at home.

1472
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,040
Brother-in-law.
- What?

1473
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,200
Brother-in-law, I am ashamed
to call you Brother-in-law.

1474
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,280
How can you do this?
How can you ruin my sister?

1475
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,760
You are a big cheat.

1476
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,600
You cannot even be honest and...
- Shh.

1477
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,960
Gagan. Gagan.
- Yes.

1478
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,480
I need to leave. It is so late.

1479
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,480
What will my husband think?
- Husband?

1480
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,960
You are married?

1481
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,120
You are married?
What is happening here?

1482
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,240
What is the angle?
- This is not an angle.

1483
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,400
This is a love triangle.

1484
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,120
How will you understand
if you don’t grow up?

1485
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,160
What is going on?

1486
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,920
Instead of watching all this
I could go to Himachal.

1487
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,800
Okay, I will drop you.

1488
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,880
I don’t care who wants to go where.
I am going home.

1489
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,640
How can you go?

1490
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,200
What will I tell her,
when she will return?

1491
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,560
Let her leave,
after that you can leave too.

1492
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,240
I will tell Bela everything.
- Hey.

1493
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,200
Where should I go?

1494
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,800
Where should I go?
- Bathroom.

1495
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,840
Then go over me.

1496
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,840
How do you do all this?

1497
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,960
How can I not do it?

1498
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,960
Have you seen the 67th episode
of the Mahabharata?

1499
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,990
You have seen it too?
- Everyone has seen it.

1500
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,080
She is your sister Bela.

1501
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,320
Sister Bela.

1502
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,480
I will buy 5 purifiers from you.

1503
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,040
But don’t destroy your sister
Bela’s home.

1504
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,240
Brother-in-law,
you have messed up four lives.

1505
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,240
(Bell ringing)

1506
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,990
I don’t know who has come now.

1507
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,240
Please go and see.

1508
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,240
My love. I have come.

1509
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,320
Forget it.
Are you doing a favor on me?

1510
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,320
Then why did you call me?

1511
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,320
You were 45 minutes late.

1512
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,040
You are always on time for Sameer.

1513
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,080
Don’t be angry.

1514
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,760
Looks like a well-to-do client.

1515
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,880
We will just do our work quietly,
drill in and leave.

1516
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,280
They are rich people.
They might feel bad.

1517
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,280
Go.

1518
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,120
Sunny, this is my Brother-in-law.
And this is my sister.

1519
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,160
Brother-in-law and sister.

1520
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,560
Brother-in-law,
this is Sunny, my drilling friend.

1521
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,990
You know we have the same terrace.

1522
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,200
And he drills for
all the purifiers we install.

1523
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,440
Don’t laugh.
We need to install 5 purifiers here.

1524
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,320
Brother-in-law, please confirm.
- Why 5. I will get 15.

1525
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,320
Not only in Bela’s office.

1526
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,640
I will also have them
installed at her NGO.

1527
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,600
Hey. You were from Himachal.

1528
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,040
You had small dreams. Small needs.

1529
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,480
Now you have a small friend.

1530
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,240
What other small things do you have?

1531
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,520
Now, I am Delhi.

1532
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,160
Here they are big flats.
Big houses.

1533
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,400
Big loaves of bread.

1534
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,720
Just think what my wife will do to
you once she comes out.

1535
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,640
Who is it?

1536
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,920
This small man has come to
drill the walls.

1537
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,720
Go and find the license.
I am looking for them here.

1538
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,990
The drilling man is here.

1539
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,160
Brother Gappu.
- Gappu?

1540
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,040
Install the purifier now.

1541
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,120
And then you should go out
with your lovely wife.

1542
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,640
After all it is your anniversary
today.

1543
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,960
So, celebrate it.
Watch movies.

1544
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,800
Huh?

1545
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,400
I will get it installed in 2 minutes.
- Listen, sister.

1546
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,320
Come on. Come inside.

1547
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,160
Work fast. Get the equipment out.

1548
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,040
What happened, Sunny?

1549
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,360
What happened, Sunny?

1550
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,760
You didn’t even tell me about
what has happened.

1551
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,280
Your sister and Brother-in-law
are so rich.

1552
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,160
Shut up, Sunny.
Just shut up.

1553
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,640
Sunny, we will sit and talk.

1554
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,400
It is a long story.
Why to discuss that now?

1555
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,360
The story is bound to be long.

1556
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,760
After all you have got married.

1557
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,720
You got estranged from me
in two minutes.

1558
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,400
What are you saying, Sunny?

1559
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,600
You are my brother.

1560
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,120
How can I get estranged from you?

1561
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,240
And I am telling you. We will sit
and talk everything nicely.

1562
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,520
Meanwhile please get
the machine and finish your work.

1563
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,520
Please.

1564
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,200
Now?
- God.

1565
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,680
No. We are doing something
bad and you are blaming God.

1566
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,080
You... I need to leave.
- How can you leave?

1567
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,080
Bela will become suspicious.

1568
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,960
You only think about yourself,
right Gagan?

1569
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,240
I am worried about you too.

1570
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,560
And in such a moment..

1571
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,960
..you should have been with me.

1572
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,200
But instead you are
moving away from me.

1573
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,920
That innocent Brother-in-law
is better than you.

1574
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,440
He is lying for me so much.

1575
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,120
And Bindu you?

1576
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,720
You are avoiding Gagan.

1577
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,120
Gagan.

1578
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,280
Gagan.

1579
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,560
Why were you hugging her now?

1580
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,080
Can’t a person hug each other?

1581
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,520
After all there is something
called humanity.

1582
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,480
Okay tell me,
who is that lady in pink.

1583
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,440
She is my sister.

1584
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,560
Sister.

1585
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,000
And the one in a sari?

1586
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,160
She is my elder sister.

1587
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,360
Elder sister.

1588
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,920
Bro, it’s the same thing.

1589
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:23,720
This is the confusion.
One minute. One minute. One minute.

1590
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,160
Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro, wait.

1591
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,520
You are asking me, what is love?

1592
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,480
What can I say?

1593
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,360
I don’t know anything about love.

1594
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,640
I am a simple man. Like a cow.

1595
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,640
And you are arguing with me.

1596
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,280
I said..

1597
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,990
..Bela is great.

1598
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,720
She can make you understand.

1599
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,240
She is Gappu’s wife.

1600
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,320
Bindu.

1601
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,720
Your sister and your elder sister.

1602
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,480
Then why was your elder sister..

1603
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,680
..calling your sister your wife?

1604
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,760
Don’t screw with my mind.

1605
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,280
We have come to work here.
Let us do that.

1606
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,800
Get the drill machine and drill.
What are you doing, Sunny?

1607
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,120
Please go and check on the purifier.

1608
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,960
I will talk to her for some time.

1609
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,040
Go.

1610
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,080
Bindu.
- Yes.

1611
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,640
You can...

1612
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,680
You can share your problems with me.

1613
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,240
You are doing something wicked, bro.

1614
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,960
I will go and ask sister-in-law.
- What? This is just...

1615
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,920
Have you come to drill here
or to lie around?

1616
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,720
One minute, Gappu.
She is chatting with her.

1617
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,880
She might spill the beans.
Go and serve them water.

1618
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,960
How can I serve water?

1619
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,440
It’s your wife and sister.

1620
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,640
So, you will be
the one serving water.

1621
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,800
Sister-wife.

1622
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,000
Mind your business.

1623
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,800
I mean I can solve your problem.

1624
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,280
There is no problem.
This is personal.

1625
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,280
Just do your work.

1626
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,200
No, I was saying...
- We are having a drama here.

1627
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,520
Why are you messing it up
as a new character?

1628
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,120
Don’t get into all this.
Just do your work.

1629
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,280
Brother-in-law,
the fire you have started outside..

1630
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,800
..they won’t get extinguished
by this water.

1631
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,800
Women are very soft hearted.

1632
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,920
Their thirst gets quenched even
with water served with love.

1633
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,880
Where do you get such ideas?

1634
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,600
From here.

1635
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,800
I am feeling very strange.

1636
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,840
I suddenly came here in anger.

1637
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,280
I don’t know what you
and my husband..

1638
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,800
..might be thinking about me.

1639
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,960
Frankly, Bindu.

1640
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,760
When I met you, I felt like
I am meeting my younger sister.

1641
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,480
What is it now?

1642
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,880
What is it?

1643
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,480
Brother-in-law,
actually I wanted to speak to you.

1644
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,360
Speak.

1645
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,240
Brother-in-law, I was saying
that don’t deal with this moron.

1646
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,480
He is very inauspicious.

1647
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,960
He spreads inauspiciousness
wherever he goes.

1648
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,080
I suggest you let him install
only one purifier.

1649
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,480
And the rest?

1650
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,560
And the rest. This is Sameer.
Buy from him.

1651
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,240
He will give them to you
at half the price.

1652
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,360
With no tax and GST.

1653
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,800
Smart boy.

1654
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,880
Blessings.
- Not yet.

1655
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:03,760
You deserve it.

1656
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,680
Yes.

1657
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,680
Yes.

1658
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,160
Sister, have you found your license?

1659
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,640
I don’t know
where my license is hiding.

1660
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,640
I am not able to find it
anywhere else.

1661
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,880
Sit with him.
I will find the license.

1662
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,560
Yes, Sunny.

1663
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,680
Rajiv has made a huge deal here.

1664
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:35,920
What are you saying?

1665
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,800
He is installing 5 purifiers
in a single house.

1666
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,760
Then what are you doing there?

1667
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,720
Bro, I have done my job.

1668
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,640
I have given your card to the owner.
Yes.

1669
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,800
If you want shall I ruin
the rascal’s business?

1670
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,960
Go ahead.
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1671
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,400
Then consider it to be done.
All right. Bye.

1672
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,400
I had come to install a purifier.

1673
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,720
Now, I am taking care of corpses.

1674
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:11,080
What are you making me do,
Brother-in-law?

1675
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,480
Yes. What is going on?

1676
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,960
Even I am sacred now.

1677
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,600
Do you think
I am a professional killer?

1678
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,680
I didn’t think. And he died.

1679
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,960
Why did you even hit him?

1680
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,280
He was done for as it is.

1681
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,960
Hello.
We were not having a pillow fight.

1682
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,880
Yes, but he died because
you hit him with a mace.

1683
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,280
I have heard that if a man
dies before his time..

1684
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,000
..then his soul haunts the house.
- Huh!

1685
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,120
Ghost!
- Ghost!

1686
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,520
You haven’t died?

1687
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,440
I don’t die. I am immortal.

1688
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,800
Sorry. Come again.

1689
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,400
I am immortal.

1690
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,720
Brother-in-law, we left him for dead.

1691
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,120
How did he become alive?

1692
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,000
How can you be alive when you was dead?

1693
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,920
No one can kill a person
protected by God.

1694
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,160
Just chill.

1695
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,240
Gagan.

1696
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,680
Who are you?

1697
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,240
Guess.

1698
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,240
Guess.

1699
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,600
My uncle.

1700
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:12,720
He lost it in childhood.

1701
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,880
And now he dropped in suddenly.

1702
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,880
Greetings, uncle.

1703
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,640
Bath with milk. And have lot of kids.

1704
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,240
Bath with milk. And have lot of kids.

1705
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,720
That’s his style.

1706
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,560
She has got a lot of values.

1707
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,880
How did you forget your values?

1708
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,920
What is left to do?

1709
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:37,880
What uncle?

1710
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,400
Humpty Dumpty.

1711
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,680
You are his brother-in-law.
And she is your sister.

1712
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,760
What are you saying?

1713
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,160
I am his wife.

1714
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,400
God bless all.

1715
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,560
So, what do you do, uncle?

1716
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:55,680
Cleaning homes.

1717
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,760
Uncle, how did you get hurt here?

1718
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,560
But how did you get hurt?

1719
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,080
Daughter-in-law,
as soon as I entered Delhi..

1720
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:12,360
..a few local goons attacked me.

1721
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,680
Oh.

1722
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,600
And they stole my purse.

1723
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,840
They beat me a lot.

1724
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:22,680
I fought back till death.

1725
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,320
But he still didn’t die.

1726
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,280
Still they put me in a coffin.

1727
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,800
He came out from there.

1728
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,880
Wow! You are so brave.

1729
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,360
Yes.

1730
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,560
But when did you come?

1731
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,760
I came yesterday...
- No, he came today.

1732
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,880
He came as soon as you left.

1733
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,240
All right. All right.

1734
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,240
But I didn’t see you anywhere.

1735
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,320
Not even us.

1736
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,520
How will you see them?

1737
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,240
He was getting refreshed
in the guest room.

1738
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,600
He just took a bath.

1739
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:58,440
Daughter-in-law, if you now
believe that I am your uncle..

1740
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,440
..then may I have some snack?

1741
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,520
I am so sorry.
I will get something.

1742
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,560
Guys.

1743
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,520
You are playing with fire.

1744
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,480
You liar.

1745
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,040
You liar.

1746
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,040
And you upcoming liar.

1747
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,240
But God will not admire.

1748
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,040
Hello?

1749
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,560
I have a fire below.

1750
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,680
What to do about it?

1751
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,480
Jewelry.

1752
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,960
The one inside the bed?

1753
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,040
Try it.

1754
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,560
I won’t allow you to leave.

1755
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,720
Daughter-in-law.

1756
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,680
There.

1757
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,360
Here you are, uncle.

1758
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,720
Thank you.

1759
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,800
Cheers.

1760
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:02,920
Done.

1761
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,560
Okay.

1762
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,960
All right, dear.

1763
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,240
I will take your leave now.

1764
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,520
Uncle, what’s the hurry?

1765
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,600
Stay with us for a few days.
Talk to us.

1766
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,520
Sure.
- No.

1767
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,480
He has got a lot of work to do.
- He is too busy.

1768
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,560
Come.

1769
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,800
Do you have any money?

1770
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,880
Gagan.

1771
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,720
Please.
- Oh yes.

1772
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,840
You lost your purse.

1773
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,240
Thank you.

1774
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,680
I will return it. Next time.

1775
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,360
You are coming again?

1776
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,000
Listen.

1777
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:45,960
Get my bags.

1778
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,800
Uncle, do visit often.

1779
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,440
And do bring aunt along next time.

1780
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,320
Dear, actually she is no more
like my wife.

1781
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,600
I am so sorry.

1782
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:56,960
No problem.

1783
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,480
As soon as I find one,
I will get her.

1784
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,880
By the way, what do you do, dear?

1785
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,360
I work in an NGO.

1786
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,960
Oh.
- I help women.

1787
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,160
Very good.

1788
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,840
Actually,
even I want to open an NGO.

1789
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,120
How much is needed to open an NGO?

1790
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,200
I will come again. Soon.

1791
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,160
(sings)

1792
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,720
Your uncle was nice.

1793
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,720
It would have been great
if he had stayed longer.

1794
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,360
I can understand your feelings.

1795
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,680
Have you found your license and RC?

1796
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,840
Oh my. I will forget
my license and RC in all this.

1797
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,040
I don’t know where are they.

1798
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,360
Brother-in-law, I am confused.

1799
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,840
Why did you make him your uncle?

1800
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,680
Why not some other relation?

1801
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,480
The word uncle is very confusing.

1802
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,520
Uncle.
Did you get it?

1803
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,040
No.
- Even the best couldn’t.

1804
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,800
You should be awarded globally
for fooling people and lying.

1805
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,760
I need a national award first.

1806
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,960
This one has left.

1807
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,120
Now first get out the bad luck
which has gone inside.

1808
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,480
Sunny. What happened?

1809
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,640
Oh my.

1810
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,240
You could have checked
before opening.

1811
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,920
How would I know that you were...

1812
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,840
Why haven’t you drilled in yet?

1813
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,080
When will you fit the machine?

1814
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,520
I was about to install it but now
I can’t find the nuts, etc.

1815
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,800
Where are the nuts and bolts?

1816
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,520
Are you mad?
Did you check before leaving?

1817
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,760
Did you get them?

1818
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,800
Sunny, did you get them or not?

1819
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,520
Why won’t I get them along?
Am I mad?

1820
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,640
Then where did they go? On a stroll.
Where are the nuts and bolts?

1821
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,680
I mean they are so necessary.

1822
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,720
How can they just vanish?

1823
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,480
Why are you shouting at me?
- I am bound to shout at you.

1824
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,520
I am about to lose my job
and you are messing up.

1825
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,800
How can you do that?
Inauspicious!

1826
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,240
I am inauspicious?
- What else?

1827
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,400
You are inauspicious.

1828
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,200
You are like the darkness of night.
You are in Delhi because of me.

1829
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,040
I pay the rent too.

1830
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,280
How will pay the rent?
How will pay the rent?

1831
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,120
If I don’t install this purifier
then boss will sack me tomorrow.

1832
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,960
I was a fool to call a rascal
like you.

1833
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,160
Rascal?

1834
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,760
I am a rascal, right?
- What else?

1835
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,280
You can install it on your own now.

1836
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,600
Go. You can leave. I can manage.
- Yes. Fine.

1837
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,880
Hey! You are lying down again.

1838
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,760
What is this?

1839
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,480
Have you come to install a purifier
or to do body building?

1840
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,360
What happened to you?

1841
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,040
Brother-in-law, he has not
installed the purifier yet.

1842
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,280
Why not?

1843
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,120
I am not able to find the bolts,
Brother-in-law.

1844
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,400
I told him several times.

1845
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,920
I don’t why he lose his nuts
and bolts when I need him.

1846
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:32,360
He always places obstacles on my way.

1847
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,200
He does nothing.

1848
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,520
But he makes me throw parties
of beer and chicken...

1849
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,320
I don’t want your party.
- Hush.

1850
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,320
Harassing a decent man.

1851
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,400
I saw your jackal like eyes and
owl-like eyes and understood.

1852
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,640
You always spoil things.

1853
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,320
And you are giving him work
and he is spoiling your work.

1854
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,080
Brother-in-law, I don’t understand.

1855
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,160
Here. Look at this.

1856
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,720
He said, I need to buy one purifier
from you.

1857
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,080
And remaining 4 will be installed
by him.

1858
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,840
You regard him as family.

1859
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,520
And he thinks you are inauspicious.

1860
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:10,440
Sunny, I thought you were my bro.

1861
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:11,800
And you...

1862
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,800
Amazing.

1863
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,960
Last time I went to Himachal
I got you..

1864
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,040
..a Himachali cap.
Why?

1865
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,200
Because you are my bro.

1866
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,080
Hey.

1867
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,880
Remember, you were
suffering from dengue.

1868
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,120
You had dengue.
Who gave you blood?

1869
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,280
I did. Why?

1870
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,320
Because you are my bro.

1871
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,920
You are after the 2000 rupees.

1872
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,200
I don’t know how many parties
I have thrown you in 2 years.

1873
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,120
Why?

1874
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,640
Because you are my bro.

1875
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,400
You are cheating your bro
for your beer and commission.

1876
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:49,040
Sorry, bro.

1877
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,990
I am really ashamed.

1878
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,480
Sorry.
I made a mistake, bro.

1879
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,520
Do you want to go for a movie?

1880
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,560
Which one?

1881
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,360
The Kung Fu Panda.

1882
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,040
Yes, let’s go.
- In 3D.

1883
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,480
Yes, Sunny. Speak.

1884
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,920
Not Sunny. This is your dad.

1885
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,240
Got it?

1886
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,040
Sunny, have you lost your mind?

1887
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,520
Garbage, you are just useless.

1888
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,160
Corrupted man.

1889
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,280
Commission monger.

1890
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,520
In spite of being with
a nice man like Rajiv..

1891
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,520
..you still remained
a poisonous snake.

1892
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,920
You will die and go directly to hell.

1893
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,680
Yamraj will get you beaten a lot.

1894
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:32,720
Got it?

1895
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,840
Next time we meet.
Next time.

1896
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,840
I will slap you so hard.

1897
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,360
Hang up now. Get lost.
Hang up.

1898
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,040
Hey.

1899
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,720
Okay. Fine. Bye. Bye.

1900
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,280
I have got one burden left.
Let me get rid of that.

1901
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,640
Bro, hit me.

1902
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,040
No, bro. What are you saying?

1903
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,440
No, hit me. Bro, hit me.

1904
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,560
No, this is enough.
Sunny, this is enough.

1905
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,560
Brother-in-law, please hit me.

1906
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,440
I won’t.
You are a puny man.

1907
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,520
If you die, there will be a new case.

1908
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,240
Brother-in-law, you are under
the oath of your wife.

1909
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,800
Don’t do that.

1910
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,040
Rascal.

1911
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,120
Just watch.

1912
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,480
Both of us brothers
will install Pavitra Pani..

1913
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,880
..in the entire world.

1914
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,720
And from now on,
I won’t make any more mess.

1915
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,440
I promise.

1916
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,990
(bell ringing)
Someone has come to make a mess.

1917
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,280
Move.

1918
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,880
Bro, go and finish your job.

1919
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,480
This is not a house, but a temple.

1920
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,480
Everyone is ringing the bell here,
but me.

1921
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,720
Brother-in-law,
why are you not opening the door?

1922
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,440
Who is it?
What happened, Gagan?

1923
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,560
Who has come now?

1924
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,240
Your husband has come.

1925
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,120
Husband.

1926
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,760
What will I do now?
If he asked me what I am...

1927
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,480
Brother-in-law, can’t we hide her?
- How can you?

1928
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,240
He must have seen my bike outside.

1929
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,480
He is a policeman. Very suspicious.

1930
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,990
Damn, why did I come here
today to install a purifier?

1931
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,600
I would have preferred to be sacked.

1932
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,160
Sir, you are a genius.
Think of something.

1933
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,960
If Bela finds out that
you are not his but mine..

1934
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,560
..then I am done for.

1935
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,840
And if your husband find out
that you are mine..

1936
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,080
..then we are done for.

1937
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,240
I am thinking of..

1938
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,320
..what to make you now.
- No. No. No. No. No. Brother-in-law.

1939
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,800
Brother-in-law,
I have become her fake husband..

1940
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,960
..for sister Bela.

1941
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,600
But I won’t be her fake husband..

1942
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,800
..in front of her real husband.

1943
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,480
Because if her real husband
found out..

1944
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,760
..that I am her fake husband..

1945
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,800
..then brother-in-law,
he is a policeman.

1946
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,080
He can beat a monkey
till he accepts that he is a bear.

1947
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,800
I don’t want to be any one’s brother,
husband and brother-in-law.

1948
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,240
What happened?
Why are you all standing here?

1949
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,160
Why aren’t you opening the door?

1950
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,280
Sister, there is a problem.

1951
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,800
What problem?

1952
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,400
She is not my wife.

1953
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,720
If she is not your wife,
then whose wife is she?

1954
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,800
She is the wife of the policeman..

1955
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,520
..ringing the bell outside.

1956
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,240
So, what are you doing with her?

1957
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,560
Having an affair.

1958
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:30,120
And Gagan...

1959
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,880
I didn’t know anything.

1960
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,400
I just found out.

1961
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,360
I will deal with you later.

1962
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,880
And Bindu, you.

1963
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,880
How can you do all this
when you already have a husband?

1964
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,640
Sister, I can’t tell you
how I am living with this man.

1965
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,990
How can he giggle
at every little thing?

1966
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,440
Sister, I am much
younger to me age wise.

1967
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,880
He is very happy about it.
But...

1968
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,520
I am not happy at all.

1969
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,320
When we go out in the morning..

1970
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:06,920
..people call us father
and daughter.

1971
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,360
They look at us funnily.
Taunt us.

1972
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,200
Do you think I like that?

1973
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,080
Maybe that creates
no difference to him.

1974
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,920
But it creates difference to me.

1975
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,760
I feel bad.

1976
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:25,600
I never imagined that
my husband would be like this.

1977
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,480
I want a man, whom I can love.

1978
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,040
I couldn’t love him,
even though I wanted to.

1979
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:40,480
And then...

1980
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,720
Then I found him.

1981
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,960
And I fell in love with him.

1982
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,240
Bindu, there is a huge age
difference between you two.

1983
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,320
I can understand.

1984
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,600
You think the rest is wrong.

1985
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:03,920
And look.

1986
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,280
Instead of rectifying one mistake
you committed another.

1987
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,800
Bela, no matter what happened.

1988
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,160
Now save this poor girl’s marriage.

1989
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:18,560
Please.

1990
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,960
And later..

1991
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,640
..you can punish him.

1992
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:36,680
You?

1993
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,280
What is going on here?
- What nonsense!

1994
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,280
What is happening here?

1995
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,720
Sir, look madam...
- Shut up.

1996
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,320
Ladies first.
- Okay.

1997
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,560
Yes, madam. What is the matter.

1998
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,800
Sir, he crossed
without the indicator.

1999
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,920
While trying to save him
my car bumped in a bit.

2000
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:50,520
And now he is threatening me
that I need to pay him.

2001
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,440
Hey. Take him away
and tell him a joke.

2002
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,840
Yes, come on.

2003
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,040
Yes, madam.
Show me your license.

2004
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,480
Sir, I think I have left
my license at home.

2005
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,200
I am a social worker.
I am going to Shimla for my NGO.

2006
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,520
It is very important, sir.

2007
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,960
Do one thing.
Get the papers and take the car.

2008
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,480
You forgot your phone in the car.

2009
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,600
Oh yes. And when it rang,
I could hear the Gayatri Mantra.

2010
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:17,000
And then I understood that
I am disturbing a God’s devotee.

2011
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,920
For the license.

2012
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,600
I am still looking for the license.

2013
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,040
You will have to find it
and bring it to the police station.

2014
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,240
I cannot make any settlement here.

2015
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,840
As they say.
Honesty is the best police.

2016
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,240
Madam,
I am confused about one thing.

2017
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,120
What?
- The bike here.

2018
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:42,680
My wife has the same colored bike.

2019
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,720
And even the license is the same.

2020
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,920
Bindu is your wife?

2021
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,840
Yes, of course. She is my wife.

2022
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,920
She praises you a lot.
- Is it?

2023
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:54,520
Come on. She is inside.
Have some tea. Come on.

2024
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,400
Oh no.
Not tea.

2025
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,640
I will come in,
only if you serve me green tea.

2026
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,400
Sure. Please come.
- All right.

2027
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,960
Bindu.

2028
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,880
Good to see you.
- Come.

2029
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,880
But what are you doing here?

2030
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,920
I am Gagan Kapoor.

2031
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:12,440
Oh yes. Gagan Kapoor.

2032
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,160
I saw you name in the nameplate.

2033
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,360
Are you Punjabi?

2034
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,680
No, I am Bengali.

2035
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,320
I am a real Punjabi.

2036
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,800
Who is this kid?

2037
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,240
I didn’t see your name
on the nameplate outside.

2038
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:25,520
He is my brother-in-law.
Her brother.

2039
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,080
Your brother.

2040
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,000
But they look similar.
- Huh?

2041
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,480
Even I asked the same question
at my wedding.

2042
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,280
Happens. Happens. It happens.

2043
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,720
Even my dad doesn’t
look like his brother.

2044
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,560
But they are still brothers.
- Yes.

2045
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,760
Anil Kapoor. Boney Kapoor.

2046
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,960
Do they resemble?
No.

2047
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,280
But they are still brothers.

2048
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:50,960
Quiet.

2049
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,040
Ms. Bela.

2050
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,760
I haven’t received the green tea yet.

2051
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,920
Meanwhile have some water.

2052
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,240
Strange boy.

2053
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,720
He roams around with water.

2054
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,880
Nowadays, anyone
might visit at any time.

2055
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,400
He is smart. A Punjabi boy.

2056
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,800
Get some green tea.

2057
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:13,990
Excuse me.

2058
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,520
You were supposed to go to Shimla.

2059
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,120
Then what are you doing here?

2060
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,600
They perform veneration
rituals together.

2061
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:27,880
She was coming here today.

2062
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,240
And suddenly she left for Shimla.

2063
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,800
She came as soon as she left.

2064
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,320
She came as she was leaving.

2065
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,840
And now they were about to leave
together when you came.

2066
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,600
By the way, you are an amazing man.

2067
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,560
No.

2068
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:44,640
I am not an amazing man.

2069
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,560
I belong to Bindu.

2070
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,520
That is too much.

2071
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,880
You are a very interesting man.

2072
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,990
He starts taking interest
in everything.

2073
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:01,920
What kind of service
are you busy with?

2074
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:02,800
Theater.

2075
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,040
Is it?
- Yes.

2076
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,520
I act on stage.

2077
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:06,560
Theater?
- Oh yes.

2078
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,960
Do you perform in theater
with everyone or alone?

2079
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,200
I start with everyone.
And then I advance alone.

2080
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,520
Even I used to do drama.
- What?

2081
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,920
Oh yes. And I used to play
a policeman in the drama.

2082
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:19,990
Honest policeman.

2083
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,040
So, people saw and said that
you are required outside more.

2084
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,040
Than inside.

2085
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,520
Go outside.
So, I came outside.

2086
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,200
I came to Delhi and became
a policeman. Look.

2087
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,240
You are just like a tunnel.

2088
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,240
I mean you are just
opening up a lot.

2089
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,800
Are you the one who brings Paneer..

2090
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,960
..when he is asked to get milk?

2091
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,920
I am the one who gets Kheer
when asked for milk.

2092
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,200
By the way,
were you always like this?

2093
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,960
Or have you done some course?
- Oh no. No courses.

2094
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,040
This is the experience of life.
- Oh.

2095
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,960
See, life is like a bubble.

2096
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:56,720
You can either live sadly
or happily.

2097
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,680
Joyfully.

2098
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,240
So, I thought to live it happily.
So, I live happily.

2099
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,960
Sir, it is a good thing
that you are always happy.

2100
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,560
But if something sad happens?

2101
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:12,360
Just think, will you be happy..

2102
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,640
..if Bindu leaves you?

2103
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,280
That...

2104
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:26,960
Madam.

2105
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,520
You have asked
a very hard question.

2106
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,040
If Bindu leaves me,..

2107
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,760
..I will be very sad.

2108
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:42,720
But..

2109
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,320
..the biggest thing is that..

2110
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,240
..she has still accepted me.

2111
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,720
Look at me.

2112
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,400
I am a below average man.

2113
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:00,760
I have a normal face
with a normal job.

2114
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,480
I don’t look good.
I have got a paunch.

2115
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,240
I know, I am not fit for her.

2116
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,080
A smart..

2117
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:17,600
..and handsome man
like you is fit for her.

2118
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,320
But..

2119
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,240
..it’s been 6 years.

2120
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,160
She has not left me.

2121
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,600
I love you.

2122
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,680
I love you.

2123
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:42,000
I am sorry.

2124
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,120
Sorry?
Sorry, for what?

2125
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,480
Just like that.
I am sorry.

2126
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,280
What are you doing?

2127
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,440
Don’t cry crazy girl.
Otherwise, I will start crying too.

2128
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,680
Bro, what is going on now?

2129
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:35,880
Your wife is hugging whom?

2130
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,990
She is hugging the right man.

2131
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,680
If you try to mess thing up
I will teach you a lesson.

2132
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,640
Got it?

2133
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,240
Gagan.

2134
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,600
Actually,
I want to say sorry to you too.

2135
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,880
While serving the society I forgot..

2136
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,280
..that I need to serve
my husband too.

2137
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,600
I don’t even give you time to talk.

2138
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,520
In spite of all this you still
love me like before.

2139
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,240
I am really sorry.

2140
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,480
Let’s go home.

2141
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,160
I am sorry,
if I have made any mistake.

2142
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,960
What are you saying?

2143
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,800
Bindu, I am just a stage actor.

2144
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,600
He is the real hero.

2145
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,240
Take care.

2146
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,680
If a wife has such a husband..

2147
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:36,990
..then her having
extra marital affair...

2148
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,800
Never spoils someone’s
relationship with your foolishness.

2149
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,560
And if you ever feel like,
then do remember this slap.

2150
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,760
You can never advance
in life by telling lies..

2151
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,640
..and forming false ties.

2152
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,990
And stop calling yourself Gappu.

2153
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,960
You cannot be Gappu.

2154
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:00,040
Gappu.

2155
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:02,720
Bro.

2156
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,960
You have been the real kinsman.

2157
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,120
There is an old saying.

2158
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,160
Sometimes the weak helps the strong.

2159
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,320
The way you helped me today.

2160
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,040
Bela is angry with you.

2161
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,240
But I am the reason for that anger.

2162
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,280
If you ever need anything in life..

2163
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,320
..then my doors are
always open for you.

2164
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,520
Come on, without ringing the bell.

2165
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,480
And listen.

2166
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,320
I know Bela. She will forgive you.

2167
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,360
But...

2168
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,720
You forgive me.

2169
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,880
What are you saying, brother-in-law?

2170
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:49,160
Because of you I learnt
so many lessons in a single day.

2171
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:54,080
And you know,
you are just a complete institution.

2172
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,520
With different values.

2173
01:40:58,360 --> 01:40:59,760
Okay, bye.

2174
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:01,440
Have you forgotten
where the feet are?

2175
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,720
Are you bending down,
or shall I lift my feet?

2176
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:22,040
Hello and welcome to our show,
the Winning Tortoise.

2177
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,200
Today we have one real imminent
personality in our studio.

2178
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,990
The CEO of a very popular water
purifier brand Zen purifiers.

2179
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,400
Mr. Rajiv Chhabra.

2180
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,000
Thank you.

2181
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:40,080
They say, behind every
successful man there is a woman.

2182
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,440
So, is a woman responsible
for you too?

2183
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,240
There is an army of women
responsible for me.

2184
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,880
And men too.

2185
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,640
I have done a lot for my business.

2186
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,040
Formed different kind of ties.

2187
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,400
Maternal uncle, aunt.
Pater uncle, aunt.

2188
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,560
Grandpa, Granny.
Grandfather, Grandma.

2189
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,990
Sister and brother-in-law.

2190
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,360
I made those ties too.

2191
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:02,400
Remember this boy.

2192
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,440
He had come to install a purifier.

2193
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,880
Hmm. How can I forget him?

2194
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:10,480
Gappu.

2195
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:13,680
Do you remember Bindu?

2196
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,240
Yes.

2197
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,200
His girlfriend.

2198
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,800
Actually, she was not Gappu’s...

2199
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:23,960
I knew that..

2200
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,240
..you and Bindu...

2201
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,600
But you never told me.

2202
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,880
I was waiting for the day..

2203
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,640
..when you would tell the truth.

2204
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,680
Please, forgive me.

2205
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:46,720
I did it that day itself.

2206
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,400
That’s why I love you so much.

2207
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,720
Hmm.

2208
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:53,760
Will you have tea?

2209
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,080
Hmm.

2210
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:56,880
Get me some.

2211
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,800
You women are so kind.

2212
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,560
You forgive so easily.

2213
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:16,080
Hello, darling.
- Gagan. Are we meeting today?

2214
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,960
Not today. I am emotionally
overloaded today.

2215
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:18,880
Oh.

2216
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,440
I can’t take on your load today.

2217
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:21,640
Why?

2218
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:23,360
Please,..

2219
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,400
..don’t mind.

2220
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:37,880
Huh.

2221
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,840
How can you be so happy
by getting insulted?

2222
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:42,920
Cruel...

2223
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:44,440
One more.

2224
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,440
Come on.

2225
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,400
I don’t know if I need
to go ahead or...

2226
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:56,920
I don’t know...

2227
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:58,800
You need hit him up close.

2228
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,320
This world. This shooting.

2229
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,480
This Manoj. This Chirkut.

2230
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,560
Don’t you remember
the rest of the dialogue.

2231
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:13,200
Hello.

2232
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,360
And you are cawing in the middle?

2233
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,160
Action!
