1
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:24,602
Mother, I'm very scared.

2
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:30,618
What do you mean? 
Why don't you try to come?

3
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:38,286
All right... 
Fine,I'll manage, mama.

4
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,461
Yes, I know that there's
food kept in the fridge.

5
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:46,635
You've mentioned this ten times
in a span of 5 minutes!

6
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,137
I'll eat when I feel hungry.

7
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:55,473
But, mama, why did all of you
go there in these heavy showers?

8
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:59,145
Do you know, it's raining
very heavily here also?

9
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:05,212
I'm feeling scared, staying
alone at home.

10
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:09,487
Please come back as
soon as possible.

11
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,158
Yes#

12
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:21,327
Yes, I will check all
the doors and windows.

13
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:24,672
But, please return as
soon as possible.

14
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:03,269
'Who is the in-charge here? '

15
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:07,215
'Mrs. Bimla Mathur was tied
to a chair and murdered...

16
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:09,547
...when she was alone at home.'

17
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:11,277
The police say that even this...

18
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,219
...is the handiwork of
the same murderer...

19
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,723
...who has killed three people
in the last one month.'

20
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:18,226
'The police also say that this
person is mentally unbalanced...

21
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:22,560
...because he only commits
a murder; he does not steal.'

22
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,234
He first makes an excuse
to enter the house...

23
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:26,303
...' and then kills the person.'

24
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:28,235
The police appeals
to the public...

25
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:31,240
...' to disallow any stranger
in their house.'

26
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,242
'And if they doubt anybody...

27
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:35,244
...they should contact
this number at once.'

28
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:39,749
'40021, 40022.'

29
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,251
'And now, for the
weather report.'

30
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:45,754
'Due to incessant rains, the
city has come to a standstill...'

31
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:27,952
Sherry! Evil cat! Do you know,
you're scaring me?

32
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,068
Do you dream? Do you...

33
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:51,535
We will now eat something...
what will we eat?

34
00:16:54,143 --> 00:17:02,050
And you will not get anything
because you always startle me.

35
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:19,123
What will you eat? I will not
prepare a sandwich for you! No# 

36
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:44,092
Who is it?

37
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,253
Oh! Hi! Is Mr. Malhotra at home?

38
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:49,096
Who?!

39
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:53,602
Mr. Malhotra? There is
no Mr. Malhotra here.

40
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:58,437
What?Isn't this B/41, Anandi,
Hilton Road?

41
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:02,179
Yes, the address is correct.

42
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,111
Then, Mr. Malhotra lives here.

43
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:09,617
I'm telling you there's
no Mr. Malhotra here.

44
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:11,278
This is Mr. Gupta's house.

45
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:18,285
Gupta# Who's Mr. Gupta?

46
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:25,133
What do you mean by that?!
This is Mr. G.H. Gupta's house.

47
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,677
Why will Mr. Malhotra give
me Mr. Gupta's address?

48
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:38,477
Go and ask him! 
Why are you asking me?!

49
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:42,151
Yeah, exactly! He's the one; 
I have come to meet.

50
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:44,150
There you go again!

51
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,485
I'm telling you this once and
for all.

52
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:50,151
This is Mr. Malhotra's house;
there is no Mr. Gupta.

53
00:18:55,866 --> 00:19:00,496
I mean yes, this is B/41, Anandi,
Hilton Road.

54
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:05,171
But this is Mr. Gupta's house; there
is no Mr. Malhotra! Please go away!

55
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,512
Does this look like Mr. Malhotra's
house, Sherry?

56
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:09,235
What's it?

57
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,238
Ma'm# Can I make a phone call 
please?

58
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:17,245
No, our phone is dead.

59
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:23,418
- Isn't there another phone?
- No. And this one is dead.

60
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:26,254
What’s the problem?

61
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:28,256
What do you mean?!

62
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,259
No# I mean, what's the problem
with the phone?

63
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,421
What problem can there be with 
the phone?! It's dead! That'it#

64
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:39,265
Ma'm# I wanted to make an urgent
phone call. Please Ma'm#

65
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:43,269
So... So what can I do?

66
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,807
Isn't there a phone?

67
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:49,345
I've told you there's no other 
phone and mine is dead!That's it#

68
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:52,270
No# No# I mean, isn't there a
phone in the vicinity?

69
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,784
How do I know? Go and
see for yourself!

70
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,449
Ma'm# You live here, so you will 
know about this area, right?

71
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,616
No, I don't know#
No, I don't know anything!

72
00:21:02,617 --> 00:21:09,354
Go and see for yourself! Please go 
away! Why're you getting angry Ma'm#

73
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,336
Sherry# Where are you?

74
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:52,341
After this, I will...

75
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,358
What’s it now?

76
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:26,374
Ma'm# My car has broken down.
I don't know what's the problem Ma'm#

77
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:31,709
It’s pouring heavily outside,
Ma'm so may I come inside?

78
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:38,385
No Ma'm# I'll leave as soon as the
rains stop... I promise.

79
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:42,390
No Ma'm# I mean, it’s raining cats 
and dogs outside and it's very cold.

80
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:46,053
Despite wearing this jacket,
I am feeling very cold Ma'm!

81
00:22:48,498 --> 00:22:52,059
So, may I come in? 
Ma'm# That's if you say so.

82
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:55,402
Look, if it’s so cold...

83
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:58,736
...then why don't you go
and sit inside your car?

84
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:01,402
I don't understand why
you are harassing me!

85
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:11,751
Great idea# Why are you always the one
to think? Why can't I do the same?

86
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:18,427
He's a strange man! He's been
harassing me since so long!

87
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:57,626
- What’s it now?! - Ma'm# My 
key is locked inside my car!

88
00:23:57,627 --> 00:23:59,457
Meaning?

89
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,800
- Ma'm# The key remained inside 
the car. - So what am I to do?

90
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:06,973
No# You had asked me to sit in 
the car if I was feeling cold.

91
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:10,535
I went there, but the key is
inside. S...So, may I come inside?

92
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:25,489
Ma'm# Hello#
I am right here!

93
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:30,498
Ma'm# May I come inside?

94
00:24:32,602 --> 00:24:35,662
Look# My husband is sleeping upstairs.

95
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:40,008
He won't accept me letting
a stranger in!

96
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:45,011
- Then ask him. - I've told
you, he's sleeping!

97
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:46,639
Wake him, I'll speak to him.

98
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,186
I cannot wake him up! In fact...
I cannot do anything for you.

99
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:55,587
Please# You have harassed me enough!
Now, please leave!

100
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:04,032
Am I harassing you? I'm feeling
cold, and I'm harassing you?!

101
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:08,526
Ma'm# You are very mean.

102
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:12,532
A man who comes home...

103
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:14,542
...is like a guest, and
a guest is like God#

104
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:11,599
I am famished. Can I get something 
to eat? Please Ma'm#

105
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,262
You can't come like this!
You're amazing!

106
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:22,606
Look Ma'm# I'm sorry. Even I'm ashamed
to say this, but what to do?

107
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:25,613
Ma'm# I don't look like
a beggar, do I?

108
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:28,616
Please give me something to eat.

109
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:31,778
It's ok# Stay there. 
Don't move ahead. I'll give you.

110
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:35,689
- Don't move ahead! - As if I'll
come through the window!

111
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:38,624
Don't move ahead# Take this.

112
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:55,140
Cheese Sandwich# You are very nice.
Who says you are mean? Thank you Ma'm#

113
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:23,667
Now...You were the only left
to frighten me!

114
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,693
Sherry, Sorry Baby# 
We'll watch TV now.

115
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:54,191
We'll watch TV, and eat 
sandwiches,right? Sit here.

116
00:28:35,145 --> 00:28:37,745
What’s it now?

117
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:41,742
Ma'm# I rang the bell only to thank
you for giving me a sandwich.

118
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:43,751
You've made it very well!

119
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:51,756
Do you know Ma'm#, preparing a 
cheese sandwich is also an art?

120
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:53,761
Ma'm# The sandwich you have 
prepared is out of this world!

121
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:59,927
No Ma'm# I love sandwiches.
My mother prepares it for me.

122
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:05,102
You have put the right amount 
of cheese!Thank you, Ma'm#

123
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:14,279
Cheese from Paris! You
don't get it in Poona.

124
00:29:15,818 --> 00:29:18,844
It must be the wonder of your
hand! It’s so delicious!

125
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:41,468
Sherry# My baby's gone to sleep?
Won't she watch TV?

126
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,830
Ma'm...May I watch the television?

127
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:07,335
Ma'm# If I watch TV, I'll forget
about the cold. Please Ma'm#

128
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:14,842
Ok Ma'm# Fine! If you don't want
to draw the curtain...

129
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:16,912
...at least increase the television's volume.

130
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:19,177
I'll think it’s the radio playing.
Ha# Ha# Ha# Ha#

131
00:30:19,178 --> 00:30:21,851
This is Radio Ceylon.

132
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,853
In this music programme
of listeners' choice...

133
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:27,185
...we'll first listen to
the request of Mr. Poonawala.

134
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:28,849
He's got caught...

135
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,859
...in a place named
Hilton Road due...

136
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,861
...to the heavy showers and cold.

137
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:35,932
He sends his request,
and sings...

138
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:45,874
'It's raining it's raining...#'
'My heart weeps... '

139
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:12,901
It's ok# Watch the TV.

140
00:31:23,947 --> 00:31:25,915
What are you watching?

141
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:27,040
Ma'm# The TV.

142
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,042
You were watching me just now!

143
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:31,919
I swear Ma'm#
I was watching the TV.

144
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:35,082
You are lying! I saw
you look at me!

145
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,989
No Ma'm, I was watching the TV.

146
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:38,925
You turned to look at me,
and I did the same.

147
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:40,929
And then, you saw
me look at you.

148
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:42,089
Otherwise, I was
watching the TV.

149
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,934
It's ok# Now, Watch the TV.

150
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,277
Ma'm# Just see if your husband
has got up...

151
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:04,954
Meaning?!

152
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:09,014
I mean, if he's got up, then
send him down; I'll speak to him.

153
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,461
Look# If he gets up, he will
come down, won't he?!

154
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:28,307
Ma'm# Ma'm# Don't mind it# 
Your husband is sleeping at this hour?!

155
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:31,478
Meaning?!
- I mean, it’s...

156
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:37,986
It's quarter past six Ma'm, and he's
sleeping?! Is he feeling fine?

157
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:40,989
He... is...He's perfectly fine!
He's perfectly fine!

158
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,391
And then, he can sleep at 12.15PM,3.15PM,
6.15PM,or any time he wants to!!!

159
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,518
Why are you bothered?!
Everybody's driving me crazy!

160
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,449
I am here# I am here!
I am right here! 

161
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:53,785
- Ma'm# Your man has got up. - Who?

162
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:56,124
Your husband!

163
00:34:58,228 --> 00:34:59,252
How do you know?

164
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:01,125
I saw him at the
window upstairs, Ma'm#.

165
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:53,238
What’s wrong?! - Somebody's
upstairs! - That’s your husband.

166
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,718
My husband is not here;
I am all alone!

167
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:57,684
You'd said that your
husband was at home!

168
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:01,689
- I lied. - You did?
- Then who is he?

169
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,692
- I don't know. - You don't?

170
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,195
This is your house! How come
you don't know who's here?!

171
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:10,266
Yes, this is my house only, but
I don't know who's upstairs!

172
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:18,706
Is it a thief?
- I don't know.

173
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:25,281
Ma'm# Shall I... I check?

174
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:30,218
Don't be afraid.

175
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:42,230
Easy!

176
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:45,299
- Which way? - From there.

177
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:56,239
Upstairs.

178
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:21,803
- Ma'm# There's nobody here. 
- What?! Noone is there#

179
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,930
Yes, there's nobody here. You
were unnecessarily frightened.

180
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,270
- But how can this be? 
- I searched everywhere.

181
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,276
Nobody's here.

182
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,608
But what about the loud noise?

183
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:32,614
It must have been a cat.

184
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:34,775
My cat was in front of me downstairs!

185
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,446
Really? Would it be hiding
beneath the floor then?!Ma'm#

186
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:43,789
Meaning?! You're too much. You
said you saw someone upstairs!

187
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,954
Ma'm# I never said I saw someone.
I only said that...

188
00:37:47,063 --> 00:37:48,462
...I saw the curtain move...

189
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:50,795
...and it could’ve been
caused by the wind too!

190
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:56,463
The wind? You don't understand.
It’s not because you said so.

191
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:58,632
Since morning, I've been feeling
that there's somebody home!

192
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:05,808
Look Ma'm# This is a figment of
your imagination!

193
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,474
- What! - Yes.

194
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,315
Look Ma'm# When I rang the bell
the first time...

195
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,820
...you'd said, your husband
was at home.

196
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:14,823
Look Ma'm# I knew that there was nobody
home, that you were alone.

197
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,826
In your solitude, you
kept imagining things!

198
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,987
About a ghost, a thief, a
murderer with a stone...

199
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:22,496
You are wrong! This is not a
figment of my imagination!

200
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,499
I had heard the sound
for myself...myself...

201
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:32,340
Ma'm# Look# I didn't want to tell you but,
I think I don't have a choice now.

202
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:35,333
What is it?

203
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:42,350
Ma'm# Actually, I threw a stone
and broke the window pane.

204
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:55,360
Ma'm# Please understand.

205
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:57,365
Ma'm# You were not letting me in,
and it was so cold out.

206
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,367
So I thought, if
I hit a stone...

207
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:02,029
...at least your husband
would wake up.

208
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:03,537
Ma'm# Please listen to me.

209
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,540
Ma'm# Put yourself in my shoes,
and think for a while.

210
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:08,372
You were alone here,
so terrified.

211
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:12,039
I was wondering how
to tell you about it.

212
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:13,877
Do you understand Ma'm#?

213
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:21,456
Ma'm# I'll bear the cost of the glass.

214
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:28,055
Or I'll get a worker,
and have it fixed.

215
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:31,058
You need not worry. Okay?

216
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:35,404
Can I sit here Ma'm# I'm dry.

217
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:39,473
Ma'm# Don't look at me, like I
am going to eat you raw!

218
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:41,407
Ma'm# I will not do anything.

219
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:50,011
Ma'm# May I make a request? 
I know you will be angry.

220
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:54,921
But I am feeling so cold!
Can I get a cup of coffee?

221
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:00,428
Ma'm# One cup, please!

222
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,432
One spoon sugar.

223
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:17,510
Ma'm# The house is beautiful!

224
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:46,974
Ma'm# I was only looking at it because
my mother has a similar one.

225
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:54,640
Ma'm# Did you think I was
going to kill you?

226
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:04,488
Do I look like a
murderer to you?

227
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:10,998
- Do I... - What the hell
are you doing here?!

228
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,568
I thought I ordered
you to bring coffee.

229
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:14,660
Then I felt I should
help you, so I came...

230
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:18,666
There is no need! You should
not have come here!

231
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:22,508
Look# Here goes your knife.

232
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:26,843
I have no knife now.

233
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:32,514
I've been reiterating that you
should not have come here!

234
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:42,860
My mother says that I look like
Anil Kapoor-a film star.

235
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:39,746
'Hello. The main stories
of the day.'

236
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:42,586
'The Indian delegation will
be represented by...

237
00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:45,092
...the Secretary of cultural
affairs, Mr. R.B. Iyer.'

238
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:49,097
'Indian fishermen freed from
the jail in Karachi.'

239
00:42:49,098 --> 00:42:51,599
'And, in Kashmir, the
production of saffron... '

240
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,601
'... has increased this year.'

241
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:55,603
'The Indian delegation will
be represented by...

242
00:42:55,604 --> 00:42:58,265
...the Secretary of cultural

243
00:42:58,266 --> 00:43:00,609
'And Mr. Syed Roshan Samir
will represent... '

244
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,610
'... the Pakistani delegation.'

245

' Both the parties will find
a unanimous solution...

246
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:08,680
...to strengthen the friendly
ties in various sectors.'

247
00:43:08,681 --> 00:43:12,619
'To relax the stringent visa
laws for cultural artistes...

248
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,623
...will be the main
focus of the talks.'

249
00:43:15,624 --> 00:43:18,626
'Also, a solution to
the problems risen... '

250
00:43:18,627 --> 00:43:20,628
...is being worked out.'

251
00:43:20,629 --> 00:43:24,632
'Talks to have fishermen
freed from...

252
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:26,635
...both the nations
will also be held.'

253
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,796
It’s good. Please sit.

254
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:35,641
Please sit. Please sit#
- Make yourself at home.

255
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,638
Please sit. Sit. Please sit#

256
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:40,976
'And now, for an
important news.'

257
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:42,648
'The commissioner spoke
of the spate... '

258
00:43:42,649 --> 00:43:44,652
'... of murders in the
last few days.'

259
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:48,656
- Won't you have some coffee?
- I don't drink coffee.

260
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:51,659
You don't? But you prepare
coffee very well.

261
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,662
'After conducting the
investigations, he found out...

262
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:56,732
...that these murders are the
handiwork of only one person.'

263
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:58,664
' Because he has murdered
all his victims... '

264
00:43:58,665 --> 00:43:59,826
'... by quashing them
with a rope.'

265
00:43:59,827 --> 00:44:02,734
'Perhaps, he is mentally
unbalanced.'

266
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,671
'The officer has appealed
to the public...

267
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:07,334
"...not to let any
stranger home.'

00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:09,673
'He has also said
that if a person... '

269
00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:12,680
'... is suspicious about
somebody...

270
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:17,685
...he should kindly contact
this number - 400021, 400022.'

271
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:23,225
'The terrorism that people
have faced in Kashmir...

00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:25,851
Do you think it’s me?

273
00:44:35,805 --> 00:44:38,035
M'am# Do you actually feel that
I am the murderer?!

274
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,209
I think you ought to leave now.

275
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,714
What’s wrong now?

276
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,051
Means what? My husband will 
be here any moment!

277
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,049
But you said you
have no husband.

278
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,720
I'd said he isn't at home now...

279
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,726
...he's gone out. He'll
be here any time.

280
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,728
Please go!

281
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:01,798
Oh, that's great! 
Let him come, I'll speak to him.

282
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,733
What do you mean?!

283
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:07,395
Let him come. I'll explain to
him, and he'll understand.

284
00:45:07,396 --> 00:45:12,908
There is no need! Please
go now! This is my house!

285
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,743
Hmmm# It’s a nice house.

286
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:18,281
This is no time to joke!
Please go!

287
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,906
I'm telling you for
the last time!

288
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,827
Suppose I say, I will
not go, then?

289
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:49,779
I let you come inside,
gave you coffee.

290
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,939
I heeded everything you said.
Please go! I beg# I beg...

291
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,970
Sssh# Quiet!

292
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,139
Look Ma'm# I am really a decent
man. Understand?

293
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,814
I've got caught in
this thunderstorm...

294
00:46:27,815 --> 00:46:32,321
...because of that
wretched Mr. Malhotra!

295
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,322
Look# I can understand your fear.

296
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:40,329
You've got trapped at
home with a stranger.

297
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,823
Ok# I can understand everything.

298
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,832
Ma'm# Do you think I am that murderer?

299
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,338
Would you have been
yet alive then?!

300
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,840
Would you have been alive now?!

301
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,907
Keep this! Keep it.
Keep this! Keep it.

302
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:11,189
Sit here with it. If I do
anything, then kill me, okay?

303
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,364
Happy? But for Gods sake,
please be quiet! Happy now?

304
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,199
You have made a ghost out
of a man in just a second!

305
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,406
Look# I swear I'll leave 
once the rains stop.

306
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:28,377
I don't want to stay here!
I have a home of my own!

307
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:33,872
Weird girl!

308
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:40,049
Now# Sit straight.

309
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,387
Looking at you,I remember Aarti.
Aarti, my girlfriend#

310
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:03,970
You are just like her.
Absolutely chicken-hearted!!!

311
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,915
When she'd be alone in a room...

312
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,920
...she'd feel someone is
coming to garrote her.

313
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:16,424
Any sound or thing
would startle her.

314
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,419
Very absent-minded! Very much#

315
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,594
If we would go for a film, she
would not travel in a taxi.

316
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,936
And if by some chance,
she would...

317
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,441
...then she'd constantly be giving
directions to the driver!

318
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:44,954
I had a good time with her...
Then she died.

319
00:48:56,469 --> 00:49:02,130
I am sorry# No, I am really sorry#
I used to love her very much.

320
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,975
I have never loved anybody
with that intensity.

321
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:16,009
- What do you do? - Me?
- Yes -You?

322
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,986
- I...I...I'm studying.
- What? - H...H...History.

323
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,994
History! My God!

324
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,327
Ok# Shall I tell you a
joke about History?

325
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,169
There was a History student who
entered his classroom late.

326
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,328
His teacher summoned him,

327
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:36,497
and asked him if knew
where Qutub-Minar was.

328
00:49:36,498 --> 00:49:38,165
He replied in the negative.

329
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,010
The teacher asked him
to stand on the bench.

330
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,135
To which he asked,

331
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:44,008
'Sir, will I be able to see
it, standing on a bench? '

332
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,018
Had you done the same?

333
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,083
And what does your husband do?

334
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,565
- My husband is not here. - No?

335
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:06,534
I mean, I am not married.

336
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,195
I knew that!

337
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:21,710
I hate cats... especially
those who like cats!

338
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,227
Aarti used to like cats.

339
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:42,568
She used to call it Catty. Catty# 
Hey Catty Baby# Sorry Baby#

340
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,411
I think there's
been a power cut.

341
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,084
Has someone outside
cut the line?

342
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,084
Hey! I was only joking!

343
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,095
Ma'm# Hello Ma'm#
Please bring a candle.

344
00:51:09,096 --> 00:51:11,599
Or we'll be just searching for
each other's faces in the dark!

345
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,229
Ma'm# Did you find the candle?

346
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,439
Ma'm# What’s the matter? 
Please wait.

347
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,289
Ma'm# What’s wrong?

348
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,302
Ma'm# Ma'm# What’s wrong?!

349
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,308
Ma'm# Ma'm! What is the matter?!

350
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:58,394
This man is a murderer!
He will kill me!

351
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,332
Don't be afraid.
This is the Police!!!

352
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:11,496
This man killed my cat!
He'll kill me too!

353
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,499
Ma'm# What are...

354
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,408
- Where is the cat? Inside!
- Inside,in the kitchen.

355
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,679
Inside! Go inside! Ma'm# Ma'm.
Get inside# Get inside!

356
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:29,152
I was downstairs#. I had suspected 
him all along. When I went upstairs...

357
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:32,525
Say Sorry you punk# Why are you hitting
me? What do you think# 

358
00:55:32,526 --> 00:55:34,456
Look Ma'm# No Ma'm# No Ma'm#
I didn't go to the kitchen...

359
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:37,123
I know# I know everything# 
I know he has killed my cat!

360
00:55:37,124 --> 00:55:40,362
Ma'm# I did not... I didn't#
No Ma'm# What're you doing?

361
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:44,041
Look over there# 
Look, there's my cat!

362
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:55,880
- But I did not kill it! M'am# I didn't 
- He killed my cat!

363
00:55:55,881 --> 00:55:58,045
Listen to me Ma'm! 
Ma'm# I was not even here!

364
00:55:58,046 --> 00:56:03,057
I suspected him from the beginning!
Right from the beginning

365
00:56:03,058 --> 00:56:04,558
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.

366
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,390
- Then what’s he doing in your
house? - I don't know!

367
00:56:06,391 --> 00:56:08,464
He kept asking for Mr. Malhotra,
and barged in!

368
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,396
- Who's Mr. Malhotra?
- I don't know.

369
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,468
-No# No# I'll tell you! 
-Just shut up, okay?!

370
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,560
Look Sir# I know Mr. Malhotra. 
I had a deal with him.

371
00:56:14,561 --> 00:56:16,571
I came here for a delivery.
But to the wrong address.

372
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:18,402
- Does he know Mr. Malhotra?
- I don't know that!

373
00:56:18,403 --> 00:56:20,633
Look Sir# Why are you asking her?

374
00:56:20,634 --> 00:56:22,735
I'm telling you, I had
a deal with Mr. Malhotra.

375
00:56:22,736 --> 00:56:24,412
Hey Mr. Hero# Be quiet!

376
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:26,948
Sir# There is no Mr. Malhotra!
He is the murderer! The murderer#

377
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,418
The one shown in the
news bulletin.

378
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:32,410
He has murdered, and
is on the run!

379
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:34,956
Look Sir# This stupid, crazy girl 
is talking rubbish!

380
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:37,117
Why are you listening to her?

381
00:56:37,118 --> 00:56:39,427
Then  what# You want me to listen to
you instead! Who do you think you're?

382
00:56:39,428 --> 00:56:41,429
Whom are you trying to impress?
Whom are you trying to impress#

383
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,761
What kind of impressions# 
I'll blow your brains apart!

384
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,767
Whom are you threating#
Whom are you threatening?

385
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,439
She's speaking the truth,
and I'm telling lies?!

386
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:55,602
Perhaps, this house is mine!
Perhaps, this girl has barged in!

387
00:56:55,603 --> 00:56:59,738
Perhaps, I didn't kill the cat,
and this girl did!!

388
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:01,942
You may have killed it! 
Or somebody else may have!

389
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:03,451
Just a minute...

390
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:09,457
What were you doing
outside the house?

391
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,461
This is not your house.

392
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:22,536
It’s raining incessantly. 
Why were you near the door?

393
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,634
Nobody has informed the police.

394
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,549
How did you come here?

395
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,515
Sit...

396
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,511
Sit!!!

397
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,526
Sit there, please.

398
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:47,555
Is it Panvel? This is Inspector
Qureshi speaking.

399
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:53,559
Send a Head Constable and four
sepoys to Anandi, Hilton Road.

400
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,630
No. It’s a case of some
suspect killer.Yes

401
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,599
Look. There's a car parked outside
your compound...

402
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:30,532
...in the middle of the road.

403
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,695
And, I came to inquire
if it was yours.

404
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:34,707
I was going to ring the bell
when you opened the door.

405
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:42,704
The story is good!
It’s indeed a very good story!!

406
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:46,212
When I asked him then,
he had no answer.

407
00:59:46,213 --> 00:59:50,885
He walked till here, cooked up
a story, and told us. Very good#

408
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,627
You are amazing! 
This man is absolutely crazy!

409
00:59:56,628 --> 00:59:58,891
Didn't he phone the
police station now?!

410
00:59:58,892 --> 01:00:01,058
You are crazy and stupid!
Can't you understand this?!

411
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:03,227
How would you know
if he phoned...

412
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:05,237
...or if there was someone
on the other end?

413
01:00:05,238 --> 01:00:07,569
Just look at him!

414
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,734
Look# He's sitting, like this
is his house, not yours!

415
01:00:10,735 --> 01:00:12,573
And he's drinking liquor!

416
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:14,647
Will a cop do so, and
that too before a lady?

417
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:16,582
- Look at his clothes.
- Ask him where his uniform is!

418
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:19,083
It looks like he has run away
from a film shooting!

419
01:00:19,186 --> 01:00:20,585
And look at his shoes!

420
01:00:20,586 --> 01:00:22,587
As if he has stolen the shoes of 
(actor Anil Kapoor) or some hoodlum!

421
01:00:22,689 --> 01:00:24,589
And you've studied History.

422
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:26,650
Don't History students
possess any kind of brains?!

423
01:00:27,828 --> 01:00:30,092
A word more, and I'll
blow your brains apart!

424
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:31,322
Let go of him!

425
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:33,649
Ma'm# This man is dangerous!

426
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:37,664
Move away! Let go of him!

427
01:01:37,764 --> 01:01:39,823
Move away! Let go of him!

428
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:44,669
Don't you move!

429
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:50,268
Ma'm# If he is a policeman, what
was he doing outside?

430
01:01:50,269 --> 01:01:51,674
You shut up! Move away!

431
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:55,181
I had parked my car on the side of
the road Ma'm, not in the centre.

432
01:01:55,282 --> 01:01:57,182
Don't believe him!

433
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:00,845
My spectacles! 
My spectacles!

434
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:04,689
Give me the gun!

435
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:07,683
If I wanted to kill you,

436
01:02:07,684 --> 01:02:09,694
I'd have smashed the
glass and entered in.

437
01:02:09,695 --> 01:02:11,696
I wouldn't have killed the cat,
I would have killed you!

438
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:13,698
Ma'm# Please listen to me!

439
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:16,703
Ma'm# No, listen to me!

440
01:02:16,803 --> 01:02:23,868
Ma'm# Believe me, and not this man!
Please listen to me!

441
01:02:26,913 --> 01:02:28,710
Use your head, Ma'm.

442
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:30,709
- Please give me the gun! - No!

443
01:02:31,818 --> 01:02:34,878
- You point a gun at a cop...
- Don't move ahead!

444
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:40,717
Don't move ahead!
Don't move ahead!

445
01:02:45,832 --> 01:02:49,233
- I don't believe either of you!
- Go and sit there!

446
01:02:49,336 --> 01:02:51,065
- I will. - Sit!

447
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,740
Ma'm# I'm not doing anything.
Sit down!!!

448
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:04,751
Please listen to me...

449
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:27,840
You are making a grave mistake.
I'm a policeman.

450
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:29,841
If he is a policeman, then I'm
the super-star Amitabh Bachchan!

451
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:33,276
- I'll kill you, swine!
- I'll shoot both of you!

452
01:03:36,883 --> 01:03:39,852
Ma'm# Point it towards him, he's
hitting me... Move that side!

453
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,284
If I had the gun, I wouldn't
have spared you!

454
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:44,786
I thrashed you so badly.
Don't you remember?!

455
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,791
Remember every word you say!

456
01:03:46,792 --> 01:03:51,296
I'll remember even what I have
not said! Take your hand off!

457
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:53,798
You stink! Since how many
days have you not bathed?

458
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,800
Shall I bathe you thoroughly?!
- Bloody swine!

459
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:11,884
He must have not informed the
police. Let me do the needful.

460
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:14,146
No! Don't move!

461
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:15,881
Ok Ma'm# Fine! 
You phone.

462
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:30,835
She's going to call
your father... Look!

463
01:04:37,944 --> 01:04:41,345
Hello Mama# Two people have 
barged in here! I'm fine, mama.

464
01:04:41,346 --> 01:04:45,179
Phone the police immediately,
and ask them to come here soon!

465
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:49,014
I am fine, mama! 
Please phone them immediately!

466
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:02,468
We will now know in which
division you are. Understand?!

467
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:11,544
Can't you see he's crazy?! And
you are falling for his bait?!

468
01:05:11,545 --> 01:05:13,878
I don't believe either of you!

469
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:16,949
Let the police come and decide
about each one of you!

470
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,541
Ok Ma'm# Ok Ma'm#
I understand. I understand#

471
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:22,887
When you'll learn about whom
you've messed around with...

472
01:05:22,888 --> 01:05:25,389
...you'll run home...

473
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:28,893
...straight to your mother, and
ask her for a bottle of milk...

474
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:31,429
Swine, do you know whom you
have messed around with?!

475
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,897
Constable, you are frightening me! 
I know the truth...

476
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,968
My friends uncle is
Commissioner Mendonca!

477
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:39,235
Hey Commissioner! Don't laugh!
These are your last moments!

478
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:41,398
I'll thrash you so badly that
you'll be given saline!

479
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:43,908
Really? Well, you'll be
given a glucose water drip!

480
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,910
I'll come to visit you, don't worry!

481
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:56,979
Both of you# Stay away from each other!
Or else,I'll shoot both of you!

482
01:06:00,427 --> 01:06:02,258
Stay away from each other
until the police arrive!

483
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:05,097
I'll shoot both of you!
You'll drive me crazy!

484
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:09,926
Even the ghost won't go near
him, so why should I Ma'm?

485
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:42,966
Stop it! What are you doing?!
I need a Cigarette#

486
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:53,974
Ma'm# Shall I...

487
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:25,006
Did you buy it from Andheri
railway station?

488
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:36,021
Can I have one?
I am sorry! Sorry#

489
01:08:17,197 --> 01:08:19,062
Can I have some coffee?

490
01:08:23,169 --> 01:08:26,229
No# I mean, we have to wait
till the police come.

491
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:29,241
We are sitting idle, so
let's have some coffee.

492
01:08:31,378 --> 01:08:33,073
What do you say? Not a 
bad idea. Very good#

493
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,088
Ma'm# Let’s do one thing.

494
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:49,254
We'll walk ahead of you...

495
01:08:49,256 --> 01:08:51,421
...while you point the gun 
towards our backs? Ok Ma'm?

496
01:08:51,422 --> 01:08:55,160
We'll prepare coffee, and then
get it back here, okay Ma'm?

497
01:08:57,137 --> 01:08:59,765
However, there's one problem. I
can't prepare coffee... Can you?

498
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,778
Yes I can# Why delay? 
Let’s go, Ma'm.

499
01:09:06,546 --> 01:09:08,104
You# Stay behind Ma'm.

500
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:43,146
Shall I shut this window?
Yes#

501
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:57,163
- Is there a dish?
- What’s that?

502
01:09:57,164 --> 01:09:59,154
- A vessel. 
- A pan.

503
01:10:01,601 --> 01:10:03,159
It’s there.
It's there#

504
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:29,523
-Where's the coffee powder? -It is
here... Wait! One of you come.

505
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:37,203
Take this.

506
01:10:44,245 --> 01:10:47,713
What’s this?! You have to
prepare coffee, not tea.

507
01:10:48,182 --> 01:10:50,477
- Can you prepare coffee? 
- No.

508
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:52,210
So... Then?!

509
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:13,303
- What’s the matter? 
- No# I'm not laughing at you.

510
01:11:13,304 --> 01:11:16,739
I just remembered that when
I had just come here...

511
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,777
...even I'd asked for coffee.

512
01:11:37,363 --> 01:11:39,331
Ma'm, move ahead.
Please# Move ahead Ma'm#

513
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:47,429
Ma'm# I won't harm you! I 
hate to point the gun at you.

514
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,770
But what to do? 
You just don't believe me.

515
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:52,643
I had told you, he's crazy!
Come on you bastard#

516
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,818
Ma'm# You felt that he was a nice 
man, and I was bad, didn't you?

517
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:02,442
Ma'm# Just use your head!
Please Ma'm# Listen Ma'm#

518
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,287
You are a policeman, aren't you?

519
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:11,295
You bastard# In which police
station do you work?!

520
01:12:11,296 --> 01:12:15,365
Answer me, or I'll shoot you!
Panvel# Panvel#

521
01:12:17,538 --> 01:12:24,472
Panvel# Panvel! 
Give me the phone number in Panvel!

522
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,310
Quickly tell me the number!

523
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:42,321
7458634# 7458634# 7458634. 
Repeat it! 7458634# 7458634#

524
01:12:43,029 --> 01:12:44,326
Dial the number, Ma'm.
Dial the number 7458634#

525
01:12:56,776 --> 01:12:58,334
Is Inspector Qureshi there?
Inspector Quereshi! Quereshi#

526
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:07,417
He... he says, there's no
inspector named Qureshi!

527
01:13:21,268 --> 01:13:24,368
Oh my God!
He is the same killer!

528
01:13:24,369 --> 01:13:26,370
You lied to me! Bastard#

529
01:13:28,074 --> 01:13:29,371
You were lying!

530
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:33,379
I have the gun now! Don't move!

531
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,379
Ma'm, phone the police...

532
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:38,382
...and say that the television
killer is here...

533
01:13:40,076 --> 01:13:42,054
- I'll kill you!
- Kill me!

534
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:57,395
There were only 4 bullets, you fool!
Mummy# Mummy#

535
01:14:09,217 --> 01:14:15,476
Look Madam# You have nothing  to 
fear from me... I am only a thief.

536
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:23,495
I came to steal... I don't know
anything about the murderer.

537
01:14:24,064 --> 01:14:26,759
I don't want to fall
in this mess!

538
01:14:30,536 --> 01:14:32,436
Do you have a rope?

539
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,108
Rope? Why?!

540
01:14:37,543 --> 01:14:40,512
Look# I can't let this madman loose.
If I do, he'll kill you!

541
01:14:40,513 --> 01:14:45,941
I'll tie him for your safety.
Bring a rope. I want to leave.

542
01:14:49,689 --> 01:14:51,953
Ma'm! Ma'm# My suspicion has been
confirmed! He is the murderer!

543
01:14:57,163 --> 01:15:00,623
You don't believe me? Fine,
I'll leave! You can go and die!

544
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:04,134
No! Please# Please! 
I'll fetch the rope!

545
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,479
Come here!

546
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,475
Come out soon!

547
01:15:29,593 --> 01:15:32,552
Bloody swine! Swine#
Can't you remain shut?!

548
01:15:35,601 --> 01:15:37,501
Sit! Don't# 

549
01:15:37,502 --> 01:15:40,504
Please listen to me.
Please listen to me#

550
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:44,505
I believe that you are a thief,
and not a murderer.

551
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:47,010
Ok... Ok# I...I
I take back my words.

552
01:15:47,011 --> 01:15:49,047
But why do you think,
I am the murderer?!

553
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:53,847
Does one murder with spectacles
on? Look at my tie and clothes!

554
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:57,020
And would I kill a cat if I
wanted to murder someone?!

555
01:15:57,021 --> 01:15:59,525
This crazy foolish girl doesn't
realise that...

556
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:01,684
...I’ll be killed because
of her fear!

557
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:05,025
Look# Listen to me. I came here,
looking out for Mr. Malhotra.Ok?

558
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:06,522
And I got trapped.

559
01:16:06,523 --> 01:16:08,534
I've hurt my head; look at
the state of my clothes!

560
01:16:09,335 --> 01:16:11,195
M...y...My entire night has got ruined!

561
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:15,706
I had sought shelter from 
the rains.You understand#

562
01:16:15,707 --> 01:16:16,936
And# You came here to steal...

563
01:16:16,937 --> 01:16:18,911
...so we are birds of the
same feather, right?

564
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:20,543
I came to look for Mr. Malhotra.

565
01:16:20,544 --> 01:16:21,615
So what’s the difference
between us?

566
01:16:21,616 --> 01:16:23,517
Both of us have got trapped.

567
01:16:23,518 --> 01:16:25,551
Now look, I pleaded with the 
girl for an hour to let me in.

568
01:16:25,552 --> 01:16:27,553
How was I to know that my whole
life would get destroyed?!

569
01:16:28,554 --> 01:16:32,556
I'm... I am ruined! 
Hey... Hey#

570
01:16:33,157 --> 01:16:36,057
I hurt my head! And now# 
Everything is finished!

571
01:16:36,662 --> 01:16:40,223
And now look, she's bringing a rope!

572
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:07,588
Ma'm# I had no choice.

573
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:09,924
Ma'm# If I wouldn't have killed him,
he'd have killed us Ma'm!

574
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:12,596
Understand Ma'm?

575
01:17:12,597 --> 01:17:20,935
Ma'm# Please believe me!

576
01:17:21,774 --> 01:17:23,605
Ma'm# You think I'm the murderer!

577
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:26,269
Ma'm# I'll call the police.
They will decide who this man is!

578
01:17:28,214 --> 01:17:30,614
Just wait!
This hoodlum has ruined my life!

579
01:17:31,084 --> 01:17:32,617
I should get out from
here quickly...

580
01:17:32,618 --> 01:17:34,686
...as I don't want to stay here!

581
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:37,221
This is an ill-fated place!
I don't want to stay here#

582
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:40,622
I'll tell the police everything!
Come On! Come on you bastard#

583
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,627
Everything is faulty here!
Come on# Come on#

584
01:17:51,737 --> 01:17:55,696
I'll tell them everything.
Where is this wire coming from?

585
01:17:57,176 --> 01:18:00,805
I fail to understand the
technology of this...

586
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,647
It’s snapped!

587
01:18:08,354 --> 01:18:11,152
But when Ma'm phoned...

588
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,987
...that man(thief) was in front of me.

589
01:18:15,228 --> 01:18:21,167
He didn't cut it. If it was
already cut, then who phoned?

590
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:31,734
This means there is 
somebody else over here!

591
01:18:35,782 --> 01:18:40,183
Ma'm# Ma'm! Stay where 
you are! I'm coming Ma'm!

592
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:42,677
Ma'm# There is somebody else here!

593
01:18:45,324 --> 01:18:49,761
Ma'm# Beware! There is somebody here!
Stay where you are, I'm here!

594
01:18:58,103 --> 01:19:01,362
Whoever you are, come out!
I have a pistol!

595
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:05,777
Ma'm. Stay where you are!

596
01:19:07,213 --> 01:19:08,703
Ma'm, I'm coming!

597
01:19:09,148 --> 01:19:11,708
Whoever you are, you can't 
escape! Swine#

598
01:19:16,456 --> 01:19:20,886
Ma'm. Stay where you are! 
There is somebody else here!

599
01:19:26,933 --> 01:19:29,730
You won't be spared, scoundrel!

600
01:20:05,104 --> 01:20:08,100
Ma'm# Stay where you are! 
There is somebody else here!

601
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:11,772
Ma'm# Don't worry, I have a pistol.

602
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:14,946
Ma'm look! There is somebody here M'am.

603
01:20:16,182 --> 01:20:19,316
Hey, whoever you are,
I have a pistol...

604
01:20:32,133 --> 01:20:35,801
Ma'm. Listen to me.
Ma'm. Please listen to me#

605
01:20:35,802 --> 01:20:39,132
- Please don't kill me! Please -
Here's the gun. Listen to me.

606
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:41,132
Look# There's something 
spooky here, understand? Ma'm#

607
01:20:41,133 --> 01:20:44,806
That man was a murderer Ma'm.

608
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:47,310
I had to kill him Ma'm or
he'd have killed us!

609
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:48,971
- He would have killed us!
- You'll kill me!

610
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:52,816
Didn't you hear on TV that...

611
01:20:52,817 --> 01:20:55,980
...the killer strangles
a victim to death?

612
01:20:56,088 --> 01:20:58,852
- Don't kill me! - Didn't
you see on TV?

613
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:03,524
Ma'm look# Listen to me.

614
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,159
I haven't come here to play
a joke or hurt my head.

615
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,897
You have to lend me a hand.
We've got to be together.

616
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:14,904
I have a pistol,
else that man#...

617
01:21:24,484 --> 01:21:27,509
Ma'm# Listen to me. 
Stay right here! Someone's come...

618
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:31,349
...but I have a pistol.
Don't worry# Stay here#

619
01:23:21,067 --> 01:23:22,967
Ma'm, somebody was asking
for Mr. Malhotra.

620
01:23:23,168 --> 01:23:27,039
Yes Ma'm# 7458634#. He asked about Mr. Malhotra.

621
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:31,042
I opened the door. He saw my
face, my bloodstained shirt...

622
01:23:31,043 --> 01:23:34,636
...my injured head, a
pistol... He then ran away.

623
01:23:37,382 --> 01:23:40,640
Ma'm# Why was he asking
about Mr. Malhotra?

624
01:23:41,087 --> 01:23:43,987
Ma'm# This is Gupta's house, isn't it?

625
01:23:47,226 --> 01:23:50,320
Ma'm# I think there is something 
spooky, something really spooky!

626
01:23:52,197 --> 01:23:54,995
Why was he asking for
Mr. Malhotra in Mr. Gupta's...

627
01:23:55,101 --> 01:23:58,001
Look Ma'm# So, when I was 
asking you for Mr. Malhotra...

628
01:23:58,002 --> 01:24:00,503
...this man must have been
hiding somewhere here.

629
01:24:01,107 --> 01:24:05,076
Ma'm# Some game is being played
with us. Stay right here.

630
01:24:05,077 --> 01:24:09,144
How did he know about Mr. Malhotra?
I was asking for Mr. Malhotra.

631
01:24:09,145 --> 01:24:12,076
This means, that man must 
have been somewhere inside!

632
01:24:12,077 --> 01:24:14,175
That man was inside!

633
01:24:14,176 --> 01:24:17,086
Ma'm#, we should be together.

634
01:24:17,087 --> 01:24:19,651
I have a pistol. There is
certainly something spooky#.

635
01:24:19,652 --> 01:24:23,194
Ma'm# There is certainly
something spooky#. Ma'm#

636
01:24:23,296 --> 01:24:29,009
You# Stay with me. Look Ma'm#
I have stayed back to save you.

637
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:31,201
Else, I have no desire of...
Ma'm# Ma'm# 

638
01:24:41,246 --> 01:24:43,441
I think she will surely
drive me crazy!

639
01:24:43,442 --> 01:24:46,382
- I hurt my head.
Why did I ever come here?!

640
01:26:46,383 --> 01:26:51,173
Ma'm, please! I'll go away!
Please Ma'm# Please Ma'm#

641
01:30:38,616 --> 01:30:40,789
M... m... ma'm# I'll hit you!

642
01:30:41,507 --> 01:30:44,737
M... m... ma'm, I'll hit you!

643
01:30:44,738 --> 01:30:48,574
Ma'm# Don't come close,
or else I'll hit you!

644
01:30:49,514 --> 01:30:51,812
Ma'm# I'll hit you!

645
01:32:08,573 --> 01:32:10,483
Ma'm### Are you all right?

646
01:32:10,516 --> 01:32:12,985
Don't be afraid.

647
01:34:59,433 --> 01:35:02,159
Yes.

648
01:36:00,092 --> 01:36:04,061
