1
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:07,792
What is happen to this city?

2
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:11,125
Ashes here, smoke there.

3
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:13,542
Why are you so silent?

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,792
Why have smoke forced
down your throat?

5
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,458
Now it's the limit of endurance.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,958
Let's bring this
reckless act to an end.

7
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,333
Smoking is banned
in all public places.

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,875
Violation will lead to penalty.

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,875
Don't smoke.

10
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,583
No let anyone do.

11
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,292
Smoking will cost you.

12
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:31,250
Hi.

13
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:34,417
Say it.

14
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,958
I feel shy, you tell them.

15
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,708
Fine, I'll start.

16
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:47,083
So...this story is a month ago.

17
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:58,625
33 days, 7 hours and
43 minutes to be precise.

18
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:03,542
So exactly 33 days and 7 hours ago..

19
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,250
..my car broke down while
I was on the way to my office.

20
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:07,750
Then..

21
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,458
45 minute.

22
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,500
Sweetheart...it took me 45 minutes..

23
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,292
..to push the car all
the way to the workshop. - Yes.

24
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,083
You were so tired, weren't you?

25
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,333
So, I stood at the bus stop,
tired and weary.

26
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,250
And the summer of Punjab.

27
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,583
I was in a bad state.

28
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:29,375
First I thought I'll take my tie off.

29
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,625
But I had an important
meeting in the office.

30
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,708
But I was really upset
that the bus was crowded.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,042
But standing next
to her made me happy.

32
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,792
Normally I don't stand
next to any boy on the bus.

33
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:49,125
But since he was wearing a tie,
he looked descent.

34
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:13,667
In the evening,
when I woke up in the ICU..

35
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,958
..I found her next to me
wiping her tears with my tie.

36
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:25,667
You can think that the tie tied us up.

37
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:29,625
Well...matches are made in heaven.

38
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,125
But here on earth some coincidence..

39
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,667
Or situation brings them together.

40
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,833
Or horoscopes.
- Or...the mischief of Lord.

41
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,125
Sometimes I think about my story.

42
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,417
'My story..'

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,917
'But I will tell you that later.'

44
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,333
'For now let me introduce you to him.'

45
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,000
'This is Dev. Dev Arora.'

46
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:11,292
'Restless...Casanova...and the
owner of Café Connect in Chandigarh.'

47
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,917
'There must be at least 5000 people..'

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,917
'..in Chandigarh's sector 17 market.'

49
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,167
'But still whenever the heel
of some girl's sandal breaks..'

50
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,792
'..he's the only one to notice it.'

51
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:31,625
'Why?'

52
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:37,708
'Because in plain words,
he's a guy..'

53
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:43,083
'..who invites trouble
for himself to help others.'

54
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:48,750
'But...in my language such
people are stupid fools.'

55
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,042
'Who like to invite
trouble for themselves."

56
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:59,292
'But foolish boy, this time
it's bigger than you imagined.'

57
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,042
Are you Batman?

58
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,292
Dev. Dev Arora.

59
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:11,042
Why do I feel you're Batman
and this is Gotham City?

60
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,333
Wow! It's a nice compliment.

61
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,917
I mean...bullseye.

62
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,792
Bulls**t. leave me.
- Why?

63
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,917
No...my bag.

64
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,500
Hey...

65
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,208
How dare you steal my bag?

66
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:29,458
Bloody thief.

67
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,125
I am sorry I didn't see.
- Its okay.

68
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,667
Are you ok
- What a day, right?

69
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,875
Thanks.

70
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,833
Coffee...in my Café?

71
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,750
Okay.

72
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,833
Thank you, Shivani.
- You're welcome.

73
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:57,958
Café Connect.

74
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,750
Interesting.

75
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,000
So you help boys and
girls hookup here, don't you?

76
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,750
I just serve them coffee,
they hookup themselves.

77
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,542
Well...you've serving me
coffee as well.

78
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,042
What are your intentions?

79
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,333
Actually, I had no intentions
until I was taking your pictures.

80
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,125
But my intentions
to help you were clean.

81
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,958
But when I looked into your eyes..

82
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,000
..my intentions got
a little mischievous.

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,542
Did you find out anything?

84
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,083
I didn't start this
Detective Agency for nothing.

85
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,583
Give me two days, I'll find out.

86
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,167
Why do you always
say 2 days and avoid me?

87
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,292
Your case is a weird one.

88
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,875
You're asking me
to find a global Indian.

89
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,542
She was born in Bihar,
lives in Delhi.

90
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,125
She works in Chandigarh
but she is Kashmiri.

91
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,958
Even the police from 12 states
will have trouble finding her.

92
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,792
Pinku, you don't
understand my problem.

93
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,958
I took a loan of 20
million to buy a new home.

94
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,708
And the one I bought
it for is missing.

95
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,250
What do I do now?

96
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,667
Turn my home into a museum.

97
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:01,917
Fine her.

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,542
I am not a dog to sniff her out.

99
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,375
It'll take time.

100
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,458
She made me a mutt, Pinku.

101
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,500
Please do something. Please.

102
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:09,667
Don't worry.

103
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,125
I am really scared of marriage.

104
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:15,833
Scared of marriage?

105
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,250
But everyone does it.
- Exactly.

106
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,750
I don't want to do what others do.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,083
I just want to live.
- I didn't get it.

108
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,292
Listen, my grandma used to say..

109
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:34,000
..there are only two kinds
of people in this world. - I see.

110
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,667
The living...and the married.
- I see.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,792
So I want to live, get it.

112
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,208
Very philosophical.
- I know.

113
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,458
But I... I mean today's
generation has thought about..

114
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,667
..what your grandma didn't.

115
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,750
The middle-way.
- What's that?

116
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,708
Live-in marriage.

117
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,875
I mean live-in.

118
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,792
I want to live with you.

119
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,042
Am I so important for you?

120
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,583
You're the most important for me.

121
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,333
And you?

122
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,167
For me?
Most important.

123
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,792
Very important.

124
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,667
Money. Lots of money.

125
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,458
Money with which
I can buy a big house.

126
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,083
How...big?

127
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:38,000
Well...big enough for me,
you and all our happiness.

128
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,042
Yes, Manish, check the
balance of my savings account.

129
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,875
Well, the land in
Amritsar is lying vacant.

130
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,917
Sell it.

131
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,208
What? That's all.

132
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,250
Listen, I needed 500,000 rupees.

133
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,125
Lord will make things right.

134
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:00,083
Hello. The network's clear,
I can hear you.

135
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:00,583
Tell me.

136
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,375
Hello... "Who wants
to be a Millionaire".

137
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,583
Hello. Hello.

138
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,292
Correct answer is A B D C.

139
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,375
Sorry...B C D A.

140
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,667
Sorry, sorry... A...D..

141
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,125
Idiot!

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,458
What?

143
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:16,875
Loan sanctioned.

144
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,750
Ta-dah!

145
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,042
What is this?

146
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,792
Our dream home?

147
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,292
Are you serious?

148
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,792
This is ours.

149
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,083
Oh my, God! Oh my, God! Oh my, God!

150
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:47,708
"Why do I...always keep
thinking about you?"

151
00:09:48,167 --> 00:10:00,667
"Why do you...exist in my questions?"

152
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:08,000
"You're my desires...
you're my relief."

153
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:13,958
"Let there be no distance between us."

154
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:20,583
"A little of you, a little of you...
are falling in love."

155
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:27,417
"A little of you,
a little of you...are coming closer."

156
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,125
"A little of you, a little of you...
are falling in love."

157
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:44,833
"A little of you,
a little of you...are coming closer."

158
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,542
Naari. Will you..

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,125
Will I what?

160
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,125
Have another drink?

161
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,042
Dev...we just refilled it?

162
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh s**t, we just refilled it.

163
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,417
I... Sorry..

164
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,917
I was saying, will you..

165
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,375
I mean like this place?

166
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,333
It's so cool, right?
I mean the ambiance.

167
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,333
The music's so nice.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,250
There's no music.

169
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,000
Naari

170
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,000
Will you..
- Hold that thought.

171
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,375
I'll be right back...
from the washroom.

172
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,167
Yeah.

173
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,125
Why am I so nervous?

174
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,417
Come here.

175
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:49,042
'What happened was...she didn't return
for a hour, a day, a week either.'

176
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,292
'All she did was sent a message.'

177
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:56,458
"Some of my stuff is lying
at your place, send it over."

178
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,250
"Hold on, where will you send it?"

179
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,458
"I'll send someone
over and get it collected."

180
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:01,500
"Thanks."

181
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:04,500
Two days again, you don't get it.

182
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,125
I can't go to the police because
technically we're not married.

183
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,625
But I consider her as my wife.

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,917
Look, Pinku...I am
bouncing like a football.

185
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,958
Oh s**t.

186
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,250
Oh s**t.

187
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,625
I am going to kill him.

188
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:38,833
Why do you take the
car out if you can't drive?

189
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:39,750
Get down.

190
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,917
Get down you rascal. Come here.

191
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,333
You ruined my car.

192
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,167
But it's not my fault..

193
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,375
Someone hit a ball...and
I turned it around.

194
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,250
And..

195
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,958
Who will pay for the repairs?

196
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:54,917
Hold on.

197
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,250
What are you looking for? Come here.

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,667
What are you saying?

199
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,708
Nothing's wrong with your car.

200
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,792
These are internal injuries,
you can't see them here.

201
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,292
Meaning.

202
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,000
The poor car can't speak.

203
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,542
If only it could speak, it would say
that you tried to tarnish her honor.

204
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,542
Honor..

205
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,625
Your car's like my sister..

206
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,667
I mean..

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,750
First you insult me
and now you're mocking me.

208
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,292
Hold on.

209
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:25,750
I haven't done anything.

210
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:29,208
But I will pay for all that...
internal injuries and other things.

211
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,500
You will have to.

212
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,375
You will have to pay up.

213
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,375
Give me your number,
address...quickly.

214
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,625
You will have to pay
for breaking the car's bones.

215
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,625
Hold on.

216
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,542
Here's my visiting card.

217
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,167
I'll pay for all the expenses.

218
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:43,750
Hello.

219
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:46,208
This is Harminder
Singh Aluwalia speaking.

220
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,375
Near Tactor Khatara pass.
There's been an accident near.

221
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,208
A Scorpio rammed into my car.

222
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,833
What are you..

223
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,292
I am gravely injured.

224
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,042
I am bleeding.

225
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,250
I am unconscious.

226
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,042
He's troubling me a lot.

227
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,125
Come quickly,
I am suffered big losses.

228
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,375
I swear I haven't done anything.

229
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,375
Excuse me.
- Yes.

230
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,667
Hi, I am Dev Arora,
regarding the Housing Loan.

231
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,167
Sir, please wait for some time.

232
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:44,042
Did you say something?
- No.

233
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,000
Cartoon.

234
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:53,750
You..

235
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,042
S**t!

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If anyone tries to be a hero,
we'll shoot him.

237
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:14,750
Mister..
- Rascal, lower your eyes.

238
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,583
Stop!

239
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,708
They won't learn this way.

240
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,042
Stay here.

241
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,792
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

242
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,792
What?

243
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,542
If you keep moving,
we'll all fall down.

244
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,125
I said shut up.

245
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,583
We'll all fall down.

246
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,667
Are you trying to seduce me?

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,750
I'm just trying to ease you.

248
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,750
Relax.

249
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:57,250
You're trying to woo
me by whispering in my ears.

250
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,500
What?

251
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,500
Sorry, it was my mistake
that I tried to reassure you.

252
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,250
Sorry.

253
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,083
What are you looking at down there?

254
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,042
You're standing on my feet.

255
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,583
And dirtying my shoe.

256
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,625
No, your intentions are getting dirty.

257
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,708
What?

258
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:22,208
Now you're trying to
look into my eyes and woo me.

259
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,333
Look mister, madam says that..

260
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,250
..you tried to physical abuse
her using the robbery as an excuse.

261
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,708
Sir, I was only trying
to me sympathetic, that's all.

262
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,542
Sympathy?

263
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,042
No, inspector.

264
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:57,625
He had all the intentions
of taking me to the bed.

265
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,708
Bed..

266
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:00,542
Sir, look at her.

267
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,625
Sir...take a good look at her.

268
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,042
If she was the last woman on earth..

269
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,208
..I would rather be impotent
than sleep with her.

270
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:10,417
Look, mister,
madam's lodged a complaint.

271
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,625
So we'll have to investigate.

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,333
Physical abuse is a grave crime.

273
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,042
Sir, physical abuse..

274
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,500
If proven guilty, you can be hanged.

275
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,250
No, sir, no death sentence.
- You will be hanged.

276
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,792
Sir, you're listening to her.

277
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,042
And you're not listening to me at all.

278
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,042
What were you doing at the bank?

279
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,917
Sir, I am getting married,
so housing loan installments.

280
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,583
I see..

281
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,292
See...he's getting married,
and still does things like this.

282
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,500
Sir, it's nonsense.

283
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,708
Please explain her.

284
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,792
Give me your fiancé's number.

285
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,417
I want to congratulate her.

286
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,625
She's missing, sir.

287
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,167
What?
- Missing.

288
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,333
Missing?

289
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,542
Inspector, she must have run away.

290
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,292
Who would marry a pervert like him?

291
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,083
Please mind your language.

292
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,958
You mind your language.

293
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:03,458
The one that you brought so close to me.
- What?

294
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:10,792
Inspector,
I didn't want to say this publicly.

295
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,250
But now I have to.

296
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:19,375
He took advantage of
the situation and kissed me.

297
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,208
Kiss?

298
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,083
You mean public display of affection.

299
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,208
Section 294 of IPC.

300
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:28,250
Sunil.
- Sir.

301
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,667
Arrest him.

302
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,750
This is cheating.

303
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,917
Sir, this lady is lying.
- Quiet.

304
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,917
Who are you?

305
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,042
Sir...my name is Palak Mehra.

306
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,083
Tell us in detail.

307
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:47,625
Sir, I want to say that he
never tried to misbehave with her.

308
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,208
He couldn't do it.

309
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,000
Because I was standing in between.

310
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,917
So technically,
he would be molesting me and not her.

311
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,042
You mean I am lying.

312
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,042
Yes.

313
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:04,333
Tell me something...how
are you related to him? - Yes.

314
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,458
Nothing.
- Nothing?

315
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,375
Okay.

316
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,417
Sir, listen to me.

317
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,542
Dismiss this case right here.

318
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,375
And anyway, we don't have to
give a report to the ACP about them.

319
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,708
We need to report the robbery.

320
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,375
So let's go, case dismissed.
- Enough.

321
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,750
Open and shut case.

322
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:29,458
No one made any mistake,
so there will be no investigation.

323
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:33,333
But. - Go home. Listen.
I've other cases to solve?

324
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,292
Listen to me.
- Let's go, Sunil..

325
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,375
This isn't right.

326
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:42,458
You're making a big mistake
letting this evil, murderer go free.

327
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,625
Excuse me.

328
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,417
Thank you so much.

329
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,083
It's okay.

330
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,792
It was very kind of you.

331
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,542
It's okay.

332
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,250
No, it was extremely kind of you.
- It's okay.

333
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,125
I'll leave. See you.

334
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,417
Palak.
- Yes.

335
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,250
Who was that handsome?

336
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,583
Questions... first, let's go.

337
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,000
Will you tell me?

338
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,750
I met him in the bank,
during the robbery.

339
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,708
Wow!

340
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,042
Bank robbery or your heart's robbery?

341
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,333
Meera.

342
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,458
Listen, how about we go
for some wine in the evening..

343
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:35,542
..after the job?

344
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,000
Done.

345
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:37,958
Okay.

346
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,625
But it's your treat.

347
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,000
You know about my condition.
- It's okay.

348
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,292
So we'll meet in the evening,
at the Vintage Lounge.

349
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:49,042
I'll get my clothes too, night out?
- Okay.

350
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,042
First I crashed my car.
Not my fault.

351
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,583
I forgot to switch
off the bathroom light.

352
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,292
Then when I went to the bank,
it got robbed.

353
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,375
Why would I rob the bank?

354
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,000
I was almost arrested
for rape charges?

355
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:11,333
Why me?

356
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,917
Why would I rape anyone?

357
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,625
Who am I talking to?

358
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,292
Switch off the light,
shut down the café, go home.

359
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,417
See you in the morning.

360
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,417
Hang up.

361
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,583
This robbery took place
in HFDC bank in sector 17..

362
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,917
..where 6 armed men barged
into the bank.. - Yes.

363
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,042
Who?

364
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,667
Oh...the taxi guy.

365
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,042
Yes.

366
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,083
Why do you need an MRI?
You were fine.

367
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,042
What?

368
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:56,292
You're lodging an FIR?

369
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,208
My car got dented.

370
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,333
Let's settle this out of the court.

371
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,583
I'll give you 4-5 thousand.

372
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:03,667
What?

373
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,958
50,000?

374
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,250
Hello. Hello..

375
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,125
Whose face did I see today?

376
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,000
50,000 is too much.

377
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,583
It's me, Pinkesh.

378
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,333
Pinku, what's wrong with your voice?

379
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,208
I am breathless from all the running.

380
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,833
What's the point?

381
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:28,292
I was running after Naari
and asking her to stop.

382
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,542
Naari stop! Naari stop!
Naari stop!

383
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,583
What?

384
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,583
You mean you found Naari.

385
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,875
S**t.

386
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,875
Where can I find her, and how?

387
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,333
Tell me, Pinku, please.

388
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,750
I can't speak.

389
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,750
Come to Sector 10, Vintage Lounge.

390
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,792
I am getting there.

391
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,833
Pinku, someday you'll be James Bond.

392
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,042
S**t. I forgot my wallet.

393
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,167
I can't go back in again.

394
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,208
Pinku. Glory to you.

395
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,542
Sorry.

396
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,417
Sorry...we didn't see.
- Watch where you're going.

397
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:20,833
Take some time off
from staring at each other.

398
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,000
Sorry, let's go.

399
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,958
Wow, how sweet.

400
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,083
Thank you so much.

401
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,208
What's this?

402
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,250
This must be expensive.
- Not more than you.

403
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,708
Why keep this when you're not there.

404
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,667
I've been in this
business for 25 years.

405
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,500
I've never seen a
piece like this before.

406
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,250
The cut is so excellent,
it had me fooled for a second.

407
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:15,708
What?

408
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:21,292
I mean...it looks just
like real diamond.

409
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,000
You mean it's not real.

410
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,167
Where?

411
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,167
There he is.

412
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,917
Sorry, sorry.

413
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:41,500
I am a little late.

414
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,667
I got here in 10 minutes.

415
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,167
And it took you 1 ½ hours.

416
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,125
Relax, your mama's eyes.

417
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,583
I am a busy many.

418
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,292
Solve 10 cases every day.

419
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,042
But you couldn't solve
my case in 2 months.

420
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,125
Where's Naari?

421
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:56,292
Where's Naari?

422
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,958
She doesn't want to meet you.
- What?

423
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,083
She's a fraud. Forget her.

424
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,083
What nonsense.

425
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,542
We were supposed to get married.

426
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,625
You were.

427
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,708
Now she's marrying someone else.

428
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:12,417
Some...

429
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,875
NRI.

430
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,833
Why didn't you bring her here?
- Do you want me to kidnap her?

431
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,750
Waiter.

432
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,833
She heard that you called her here.
- Yes, sir.

433
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:25,208
So?
- So she got scared and ran away.

434
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:28,167
Get chilly chicken, the usual.
- Okay.

435
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,917
And...large scotch, hurry up.
- Okay, sir.

436
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,958
Today we brothers
will drink together.

437
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:32,750
Okay.

438
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,542
I don't think she told
you why she left suddenly?

439
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:36,708
She did.

440
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:40,500
She said she never liked you.

441
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,000
And you suddenly
bought a home for her.

442
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,875
She didn't know how to react.

443
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,250
Forget her.

444
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:50,917
Do one thing.
- Yes, sir.

445
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,292
Get the entire bottle.

446
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,375
Brother is very upset.
- Okay.

447
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,125
I don't want such expensive grief.

448
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:57,042
Go on.

449
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,458
I forgot my wallet at home.

450
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,375
You're my brother, don't worry.

451
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,625
I am there.

452
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,500
Just forget her.

453
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:05,625
She's not worthy of you.

454
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:07,625
Don't be so upset.

455
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,667
There's no dearth
of girls in Chandigarh.

456
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,250
There are many other fine girls.

457
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:12,208
Hold on.

458
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,958
Look there..
- Sir.

459
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,167
Thank you.
- Welcome, sir.

460
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,167
Take a look around. 3 o'clock.

461
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,083
That's 6...
- 9 o'clock.

462
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,375
Look behind me.

463
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,792
Just drink and..

464
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,083
What are you doing?

465
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:35,250
Cheers.

466
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,000
Drink in grief out.

467
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:42,917
Out!

468
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,625
I'll be back from the washroom.
You drink.

469
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,625
Why is such a bad day today?

470
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,042
Now he'll think I am crazy?

471
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,458
Why hasn't Meera arrived yet?

472
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:29,167
Oh gosh, they stole my wallet.

473
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,250
I lost even the remaining
3000 that I had.

474
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:39,125
Rascal, scoundrels...
they won't get too far with my money.

475
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,833
What now?

476
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:41,917
Meera!

477
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,875
Hello. Meera.

478
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,000
Where are you?

479
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,375
At home? Where else?

480
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:55,375
Oh hello..
- Not hello, say hell.

481
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,333
I've been waiting for 1 ½ hour..

482
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:59,417
..and already had
three glasses of wine.

483
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,375
I completely forgot,
I am so sorry Palak.

484
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,708
Look, I will forgive you.

485
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,375
Just get here in half an hour.

486
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,208
Actually, there's a problem.

487
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,750
What problem?

488
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,625
I was about to get out..

489
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,708
..but few of my relatives
arrived from Delhi.

490
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,625
Look, Meera...make some
excuse and get here.

491
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,625
Yes, mom, the fritters are ready.
I'm coming.

492
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,250
Actually, I even need
to prepare dinner for them.

493
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,250
So I can't come.

494
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:30,667
I know it all...what
dinner and whose dinner.

495
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,792
Listen, you can think
whatever you like.

496
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,375
I can't come now, that's all.

497
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,792
Hello. Meera.

498
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,000
Meera.

499
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,125
Bloody desperate woman.

500
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:54,667
Are you asleep in the washroom?

501
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,792
Where are you?

502
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:58,750
I am out.
- What?

503
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,708
Out? Where? How?

504
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,667
Look...I'll be in big trouble.

505
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,917
Don't joke.

506
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,250
I am not joking,
I had an important meeting, so..

507
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,250
Meeting..

508
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,417
I told you
I forgot my wallet at home.

509
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:16,167
Mama's eye, you don't get it.
- Pinku..

510
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,750
Why doesn't anyone ever return
from the washroom in my story?

511
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:34,042
'That boy from the
bank is sitting alone.'

512
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:40,042
'If I add my bill to his, I'll be saved
from this embarrassing situation.'

513
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,417
'She saved me in the morning.'

514
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,958
'I guess she's sent
by God to save me again.'

515
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,667
'She's Goddess herself.'

516
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:55,833
Goddess.

517
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:05,708
Hi.

518
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:11,792
I think he's falling for it.

519
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,250
Hi.

520
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,708
Oh...hi.
- How are you?

521
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,167
I am good.

522
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,625
Can I sit..

523
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,917
I was sitting all alone,
and so were you.

524
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,667
So I thought I'll
give you some company.

525
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,542
Can I..

526
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,000
Sit, please. - Thank you.
- Sit, sit.

527
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:48,042
I forgot to thank you in the morning.

528
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,542
Afterall you saved me
from imprisonment.

529
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:52,333
I saved you from imprisonment.
You should remember such things.

530
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,458
Of course.

531
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,375
Sir shall I serve your drink here?

532
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,958
Sure! No need to ask!

533
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:00,125
In fact combine the bills.

534
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,708
Sir check..

535
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,083
I.. umm..

536
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,292
Ma'am check..

537
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,500
I know. I know.

538
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:28,750
Who is paying?

539
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:29,667
Him.

540
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:31,917
Him.

541
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,333
Your bill is Rs. 5335.

542
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,583
Ok.
- Who will pay the bill?

543
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,958
Actually the treat is from sir.

544
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:46,375
Listen.. you pay today.

545
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:49,458
Tomorrow I'll give you
a double treat. Promise.

546
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,333
Look, I saved you from imprisonment.

547
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,417
So you should be giving the treat.

548
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,792
I know. You're right.

549
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,708
Look.. don't think
I'm such a lowly person.

550
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,417
By mistake I forgot
my wallet at home.

551
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,208
I swear I'm not lying.

552
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,583
And my wallet was stolen.

553
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:08,917
What are you saying!

554
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:10,542
What shall we do now?

555
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:12,458
Let me think.

556
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,000
You keep this.

557
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,292
What is this?
Where is the money?

558
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,792
It's a solitaire.

559
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,292
You keep it as a mortgage.
Tomorrow he'll come and pay you.

560
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:28,125
Brother, I'll come before
you reach here and make the payment.

561
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,125
Is it real?

562
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,667
Hey! It's a solitaire.

563
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,292
What do you think? I'm giving
you street goods worth Rs.250?!

564
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,500
Ok, Ok. Tomorrow as soon as the
bar opens, come and make the payment.

565
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,125
Alright. Right on time.

566
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,208
Keep it carefully..
I've the bill. Come on.

567
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,542
Hi..

568
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,125
Sorry. I owe you big time.

569
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:00,833
It's ok.

570
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:03,417
Tomorrow I'll pay him
and get back your ring.

571
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,542
Better.

572
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:09,625
By the way.. where shall
I give you your ring? Your address..

573
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,667
Why take the trouble?
I'll myself collect it from here.

574
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,875
Sure?

575
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:15,333
Ok.

576
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,958
Ok, bye.
- Bye.

577
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,750
Oh damn!

578
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:36,625
Sorry.. umm.. that.. water..
car.. you would have been drenched.

579
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:37,583
Are you alright?

580
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,542
Yeah!

581
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:40,292
Are you sure you are ok?

582
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,167
Yeah. Just a little bit cold.

583
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:43,583
Thank you so much!

584
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,042
Hey you blind man!
Can't you see where you're driving?!

585
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,458
Palak..
- Yes.

586
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,792
Hey you blind man..

587
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:56,042
Hey you blind man!
Can't you see where you're driving?!

588
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,125
Listen.. if you don't mind,
my house is nearby.

589
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,708
You're completely drenched.
I can at least do that much for you.

590
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,125
You can come and change.

591
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,292
You don't even have money.
How will you pay the taxi fare.. tell me.

592
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,958
I'll give you some money.

593
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:18,625
I'm a very decent guy.

594
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,083
No, no. That's not the case.

595
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,042
Come on.

596
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:39,958
"May the morning lose
itself in the arms of dew.."

597
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:46,083
"Feel like adorning
my eyes with your dreams!"

598
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,958
"May the morning lose
itself in the arms of dew.."

599
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:04,000
"Feel like adorning
my eyes with your dreams!"

600
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:09,958
"In my breaths.. your voice echoes!"

601
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:15,250
"I'm your word and
you're my language!"

602
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:27,167
"Let's be naughty all night..
lets break free!"

603
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:39,208
"Let's be roguish all night..
lets break free!"

604
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:49,542
You mean she just left you like that?

605
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,208
Without any reason?

606
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,750
In fact I also bought
this house for her.

607
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,500
Using up all my savings. Imagine.

608
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,042
That is so romantic.

609
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:06,667
These days who does
such things for love?

610
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,792
Me.. am a bit old school, right.

611
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:15,542
A bit?! You're too much old school.

612
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,333
By the way what do
you do for a living?

613
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:21,500
Nothing much..
I just run a small café.

614
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,583
Sector 12, Café Connect.

615
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,917
Café Connect? Is it yours?

616
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:27,917
Have you been there?

617
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,125
I came once.
I like Café Mocha over there a lot.

618
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,500
After that, I didn't find any company.

619
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:39,667
So next time you pass from there,
please..

620
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,000
I'll give you company.
And café Mocha will be my treat.

621
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Surely.

622
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,125
Was Café Connect idea intentional?

623
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,125
Yeah.

624
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,250
I was fifteen when my dad passed away.

625
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,042
Since then,
I've seen mom struggling alone.

626
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,125
That loneliness troubles a lot.

627
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:06,833
So when I see a couple happy together,
I too feel joyous.

628
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,583
So I keep trying through café.

629
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:12,833
That's sweet.

630
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,833
Shall I ask something?

631
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,792
That ring..
was it your engagement ring?

632
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:27,250
Why? If I say yes,
you won't go to collect it?

633
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,208
No! I mean yes..
I'll surely go. I just asked.

634
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,083
My boyfriend gave me.

635
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,667
But we have broken up.

636
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,542
Oh.

637
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,167
Shall I ask you something?

638
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,500
What is your name?

639
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,042
Won't you ask me my name?
- No.

640
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,625
I'll tell myself. It's Palak.

641
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,208
I know. I heard it in the bank.

642
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,042
Shop now..

643
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,750
By the way, here is my house.

644
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,625
This is my garden.

645
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:15,500
Wow! Do you like gardening too?

646
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,792
Yes. Perhaps in my genes.

647
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,792
My forefathers were farmers. So..

648
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:23,958
Only difference is that
my farms are a bit small.

649
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,333
I love that one.

650
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,458
I was saying that..

651
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:50,583
Damn! As usual!

652
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:51,667
Are you ok?

653
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:56,000
Sorry. I forgot to switch off
the lights in the hall in a hurry.

654
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,833
Wow!
- How is it?

655
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,042
This is Naari, right?

656
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,542
Yes. How is she?

657
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,042
Like a misfortune.

658
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,292
Are you fond of photography too?

659
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,958
Yes. I did a diploma in photography.

660
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,792
So just like that..
a few photographs.. Show off!

661
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,292
You're so multitalented, buddy!

662
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,667
Isn't it! Thank you.

663
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:20,375
Still Naari left you.
I'm quite surprised.

664
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,333
There is a room upstairs.
You freshen up.

665
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:26,625
I'll show you.
- Ok.

666
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,458
Come. Carefully.

667
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:29,625
Yes.

668
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,708
Whose things are these?

669
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,208
Naari's.

670
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,583
See if something fits you.

671
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,458
Ok.

672
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:43,000
By the way, she had messaged
me that she will have it collected.

673
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:48,167
Very materialistic girl!

674
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,792
She forgot the person,
but she remembers her things!

675
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,208
You speak any nonsense,
isn't it!

676
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,208
Actually you're right.

677
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,917
You know she is marrying someone else.

678
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,958
I'm such a big fool, isn't it?

679
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,500
In fact you're quite cute.

680
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,958
I'll make coffee.

681
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,042
I'm still changing.

682
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,292
Yes.. you take your time.

683
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:34,333
I just wanted to ask
how much sugar in your coffee?

684
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,833
Hi Dev!

685
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,667
Oh my God! You've become so thin.

686
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,292
Because you missed me, right.

687
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,417
You missed me a lot, didn't you?

688
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,083
Not a single day passed
when I didn't remember you!

689
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:58,375
Really. Won't you invite me in?

690
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,125
Fine. I'll myself come inside..
my luggage.. - No, no, no!

691
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,167
What?!

692
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,542
Dev!

693
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,250
You.. you..
Can't you come tomorrow? - Dev..

694
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,958
You must be joking.

695
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,917
What do you think?
I'll come back here again tomorrow?

696
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,667
No.. don't know..
actually you dropped in suddenly..

697
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,708
Listen Naari, I..
- Dev.. Dev..

698
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm a bit busy.

699
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,875
You're busy. I see.
- No, you..

700
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:22,667
I don't think you're busy. So
stop this drama and just two minutes..

701
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,542
Naari.. listen..
listen.. Naari.. - Dev..

702
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,542
Stop.. stop..
- Let me go..

703
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:32,917
Oh oh! So that's the case.
That's why I was being stopped.

704
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,375
Palak, its fine.

705
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,042
Is she your girlfriend?

706
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:40,708
After being your boyfriend, I don't think
he would like to have a girlfriend.

707
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,125
You're so worried about him!

708
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:47,000
Hmm. Yes I do.
You see I'm not like you.

709
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,958
No one can actually be like me!

710
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,083
Because I'm the only one like me.
Isn't it Dev?

711
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,750
I think I should leave.

712
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,333
Yes. It's late.

713
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,333
Palak, you don't have to go.

714
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:57,042
It's ok.

715
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,042
Palak.. Palak.. listen..

716
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,833
Bye!
- Palak. Palak..

717
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,958
Forget it Dev,
she is not your girlfriend too!

718
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,875
I'll be back in two minutes. Alright.

719
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,250
And I couldn't stop the girl
friend that I did have, right.

720
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,667
You disappear suddenly!

721
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:12,583
And then you return
after two months. Hi!

722
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,000
He he! Ha ha!

723
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,333
How do you manage that?!

724
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,208
And me.. am searching all
over the town like a mad person!

725
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:23,917
I keep sitting here
and there and keep thinking!

726
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,125
About you!

727
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:28,042
She'll return, buddy. She loves you.

728
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:33,167
I cry all night. I can't sleep.

729
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:38,333
You must never have thought about it.

730
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:42,750
Why am I saying this?

731
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:44,333
Why am I even talking to you?

732
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,083
So materialistic!

733
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:58,667
Sorry! I'll take my things..
just two minutes.. forget it.

734
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,333
Shall I tell you something?

735
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,500
Good that I bought the bungalow
under mom's name not yours.

736
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,542
Else you would have thrown me out!

737
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,000
No..

738
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,958
You know what? You're right.

739
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,042
We can't have anything between us.

740
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:20,417
I know it was over
for you a long back.

741
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,000
Thank you.
Today, I break up from my side.

742
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,292
You can take whatever things you like.

743
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,875
Rest I'll have them thrown outside.

744
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,875
Good bye.
- OK.

745
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,208
Palak.. damn..

746
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,042
Palak..
- Yes.

747
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,458
You don't have the money, right.

748
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:59,708
How will you pay for the taxi?

749
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,000
Taxi fare.

750
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,167
Thank you.

751
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:16,333
Palak,
we're meeting tomorrow right?

752
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,917
Damn! You want to
die under my car itself!

753
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,625
Hey you!

754
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:31,208
Brother what's your problem?!

755
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:32,208
Brother..

756
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:34,208
What do you want? Speak!

757
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,125
Shall I get horse shoes
fitted in my brakes?

758
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,583
By god! - Or shall I sell
the taxi and become a truck driver?!

759
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:43,875
Don't know.. don't know why I keep
banging in to your taxi only today!

760
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,333
That's bound to happen..

761
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,583
Wanted to settle things in Rs. 5000.

762
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:50,125
Now tell me.. shall I dial
up the police number again?

763
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,375
No! Not police!

764
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,000
Brother, you can take 50000.

765
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:59,125
But listen.. just need to talk
to the girl for a couple of minutes.

766
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,417
The one sitting in your car.

767
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,417
I don't care. Go ahead.

768
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,583
And listen.. you'll have
to give extra for taxi waiting.

769
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,667
Can I get your number?

770
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:17,500
You may think this is madness, but
I just broke ties with her and came.

771
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:21,750
Palak, I don't know
if this makes sense or not..

772
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:24,500
I don't know if you like me or not.

773
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:26,167
I don't know what will happen next..
really don't know.

774
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,000
I haven't thought about it.
I couldn't think about it.

775
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,250
I just came running after you.

776
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,292
I couldn't stop myself.

777
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,000
Please don't think I'm two timing
or something. You know the money..

778
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,458
No, no.. Dev, I..

779
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:44,708
Palak.. I waited two months
like crazy for her to return.

780
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:48,458
But suddenly when she came,
I was not happy at all.

781
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,417
I don't know but I
didn't like you leaving.

782
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:58,125
I just wanted to say that..
I don't know what I'm trying to say..

783
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,375
You understand what I want to say,
don't you?

784
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,708
Because I myself don't understand.

785
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:06,583
I am speaking too much right.
I shouldn't.

786
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,500
Brother..
- Yes?

787
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:10,083
Would you have a pen and paper?

788
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:11,625
Have you got a cheque book?

789
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,583
Your payment will be in cash.
Right now, a pen and paper please..

790
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:16,042
Yes, yes.

791
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,792
Take.

792
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:28,042
Palak,, please call me.
We'll meet once.

793
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:32,708
After that if you don't feel like..
I'll never force you. Promise.

794
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:38,333
Take it girl. It's just a number,
not a wedding card.

795
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,958
Call me please.
I'll wait for your call.

796
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:48,833
Hey! Even I'll wait
for your call tomorrow.

797
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:51,083
Yes, yes. Thank you.

798
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,542
Hey.. please bring the
amount in thousand rupees notes.

799
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,583
It's easier to carry.

800
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:58,875
Bye.

801
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:23,833
"I was on the streets
this way since ages!"

802
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:34,542
"Roguishness all night!"

803
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,542
It was so embarrassing, right?

804
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,917
It was I who spent
and she who got the fame.

805
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,417
People want free entertainment.

806
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,792
Every man was looking at me.

807
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:59,417
Buddy.. you don't get
to see such scenes everyday!

808
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:05,000
So what happened was that our parents
fixed up our alliance without telling us.

809
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:08,167
And that day, we went to
meet each other for the first time.

810
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,958
How do you find my top?

811
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,583
Zari work with velvet.

812
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,333
I've designed it myself.

813
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:16,333
I'm a designer.

814
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:19,333
Can't you Chandigarh
girls think of anything else?

815
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:24,250
Those who can't be actresses,
become designers.

816
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:28,583
By the way, how did you know
that I wanted to be a heroine?

817
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:30,125
I had told mummy before itself.

818
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,292
I don't want to marry
a girl from Chandigarh!

819
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,792
Just two names come forth.
Pooja and Neha.

820
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:38,042
By the way, what is your name?

821
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,583
I am Pooja.

822
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,375
And your hobbies must be applying
designer henna on your hands..

823
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,667
..and collecting teddy bears. Right?

824
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,625
Oh god! Now don't tell me that you
eat 'Golgappas' with your friends..

825
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:55,625
..in sector 17 everyday. And
Shahrukh Khan is your favorite actor.

826
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:57,750
Don't you like all this?

827
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,208
Not at all.

828
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:05,500
You know what?!
You must not marry a Chandigarh girl.

829
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:08,792
You know why? Because Chandigarh
girls are more sweet..

830
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,667
..for rude and heartless like you!

831
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:30,167
And that day I realized that it was more
embarrassing to be topless than heartless.

832
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,333
And now, every evening,
he goes with me to eat 'Golgappas'.

833
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,917
And every Saturday,
we watch a Shahrukh movie too.

834
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,375
Raj has gifted me
35 teddy bears till now.

835
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:41,708
And yes.. there is a
separate room for them too.

836
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:46,500
And now we have decided that
we'll name our daughter, Neha.

837
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:50,958
At times,
I hear a story in my heart.

838
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:52,750
My story.

839
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,792
But there is still time for my story.

840
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,333
Right now, he is Pinkesh.

841
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,125
And this is the
beginning of his story.

842
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:06,042
No, the end.
The story started two months ago.

843
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:12,167
Tell me something.
Why are you after her?

844
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,333
Has she eloped with your money?

845
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:15,542
No buddy.

846
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:20,083
I just want to meet her once
and ask her.. why did she do this?

847
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:21,875
Hmm.

848
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,417
What is this?
- Milk.

849
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,708
One is her and one you!

850
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:34,083
He is the only mistake of his parents.

851
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:39,875
On his passport, his birth
place is not India, but Air India.

852
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:42,417
The rascal was born on an aeroplane.

853
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:48,250
Hence his dreams were also very big
and high! The aerial kind.. the rascal!

854
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,333
But the dream that
he is dreaming this time..

855
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,958
..is too big for his standard.

856
00:51:59,042 --> 00:52:03,583
It was ok as far as an aeroplane.
But this is a rocket.

857
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:06,167
You are not worthy of boarding it.

858
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:11,000
Keeping an eye on the girl,
he actually fell for her.

859
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:15,458
Not his fault.
The woman was so attractive.

860
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:18,125
The lad turned defective
from detective.

861
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:22,125
Idiot.. should have learnt
something from your friend's mistake.

862
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:26,042
What shall I do now?

863
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:28,542
Shall I hang her picture in my house?

864
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:31,583
I'm not your mamma's
dog to sniff her out.

865
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:32,750
It'll take time.

866
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:46,917
"You're sleep in my eyes..
and a drop of dew.."

867
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,542
"You're the thirst of my lips..
and my reason to live!"

868
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:13,583
"You're sleep in my eyes..
and a drop of dew.."

869
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:20,167
"You're the thirst of my lips..
and my reason to live!"

870
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:27,042
"You're the morning rain falling
on the hazy glass of my dreams!"

871
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:33,625
"A bit of me and a bit of you..
are getting lost in love!"

872
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:42,958
"A bit of me and a bit of you..
are getting complete!"

873
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,333
I mean.. you don't worry. Ok.

874
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,458
I'm hanging up now, ok. Bye.

875
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:02,792
Hey I'm Bond!
Pinkesh Bond! Don't worry!

876
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,958
Hey mamma's eyes!

877
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:14,125
Don't cry sister..
brother will buy you a new top.

878
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:16,458
Yes.. am coming.

879
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:40,042
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

880
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:53,417
Madam-ji..

881
00:54:57,708 --> 00:55:02,083
You!
- What happened? Need any help?

882
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:07,583
I was having a bad headache.
So want to go to a doctor.

883
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:08,667
So give me the keys.

884
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,208
Keys?!

885
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,208
Me?!

886
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:15,792
Madam-ji, if brother comes to know,
he'll kill me.

887
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:19,375
Hey.. hello.. give me the keys.
Want to go to a doctor. Hurry up.

888
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:21,958
Oh! You're talking
about the car keys?!

889
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:23,833
You're so amazing madam-ji!

890
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:26,000
When I'm here, you'll drive?!

891
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:28,333
You sit and relax. I'll drive.

892
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:30,625
Come.

893
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,000
Damn it.

894
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,167
Your mama's eyes.

895
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:40,958
Ok, listen.
Do something. Drink this medicine.

896
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,958
But madam-ji..
you were having a headache.

897
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:49,083
I mean if I drink it..
you'll be alright? - Yes.

898
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:50,458
Yes. I'm having a headache.

899
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:57,000
But this headache you see is
a very terrible and infective disease.

900
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,292
It can pass from one
person to another very fast.

901
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:02,875
And I don't wish at all that
you get this headache of mine.

902
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,167
Madam-ji, seeing you this way,
I remember my mother!

903
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:10,458
Aww!

904
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:13,750
Even she used to scold
and feed me things this way!

905
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:15,750
Ok.

906
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,125
Madam-ji, if you give me poison,
I'll happily drink that too.

907
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:20,458
Ok then drink. Drink it.

908
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:21,583
Give.
Should I drink the entire bottle?

909
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:23,375
Yes. You've to drink
the entire bottle. Drink it!

910
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,542
Come on.. drink all of it!

911
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:30,167
Very good.. very good.. very good!

912
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,750
Madam-ji why is the car shaking?

913
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:36,042
A little bit side effect. - Madam-ji hold
my hand, else you'll fall down.

914
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,667
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

915
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,292
Oh my god!

916
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,083
Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

917
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:31,917
Naari..

918
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:33,917
Shut up!

919
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:37,833
What have you done?!

920
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:42,042
What are you doing here?

921
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,708
Hey! Not a difficult job to find you.

922
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,292
Your perfume can be smelled
in the entire neighborhood!

923
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:45,958
And the door was open too.

924
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:47,917
But why are you after me?

925
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,792
Hey mamma's eyes!
I'm not after you!

926
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,083
Dev is after me due to you!

927
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:51,958
That's why I'm after you!

928
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:54,792
Get out!
Get out! Get out from my house!

929
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,250
Yes, yes. I'll get out.

930
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:58,042
But what about the
one who will come after me?

931
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,042
And are you aware
whom you've looted?

932
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,083
Do you know who he is?!

933
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,292
Of course. Jazzy.

934
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:05,875
Jazzy!

935
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,167
She is saying it
as if it is Jazzy B!

936
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,708
Do you know who he is?!

937
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:10,750
Do you know who he is.

938
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:11,667
Who?

939
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,083
Not who! Don! He is a don!

940
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:15,583
If you want to save your life,
run from here.

941
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:18,750
Listen.. listen.. since when did
you get a license to be a detective?

942
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,542
Yes. Since you ran, I got it.

943
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,000
But I don't know what
kind of thug you are!

944
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,917
You must know whom
to thug and whom not to!

945
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,042
What a thug!

946
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,500
Thug! Thug! You think I'm a thug!

947
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,042
Who told you I'm a thug?!

948
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:33,375
I see.. who told me?!

949
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:34,958
Shall I tell you all your episodes?

950
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:37,292
You know all of them?

951
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:39,292
Deepak, Pahadganj.

952
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,250
Swami Jewellers, Janakpuri.

953
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,042
R. D. System, Nehru Place.

954
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,542
Malkit Singh, Sector 14.

955
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,167
Rohan Purohit, Civil Lines.

956
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,458
Ram Gopal Contractor, Mohali.

957
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:52,250
Raj, Mahi, Mannu,
Modi, Sushant, Ankit, Amit, Siddharth.

958
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,875
And that poor highway fellow, Sharib.

959
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:55,958
You looted him too.

960
00:58:56,042 --> 00:58:57,958
And that Madi anna..
he was your own man!

961
00:58:58,042 --> 00:58:58,500
You looted him too!

962
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:02,292
Hey! Hello! That Madi Anna..
that Kalu.. he himself was a thug!

963
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:05,542
He thought that I'm a wealthy girl.
Hence he was after me.

964
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,167
Anyways.. good research.

965
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,333
Isn't it?

966
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,458
What else do you know about?

967
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:12,417
What else.. what else?

968
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,000
Ask me that later!
Right now, let's get out of here..

969
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:18,167
..before I get killed
too because of you.

970
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:18,875
Please pal!

971
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,500
You act so smart! So smart!

972
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:24,458
You were with Jazzy with so long. Didn't
you know what kind of a man he is!

973
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:27,167
If he doesn't like the food
in a restaurant, he breaks it.

974
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:30,458
If he doesn't like a room in a hotel,
he sets the hotel on fire.

975
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:33,583
And if he finds out that he has your
money.. I mean you have his money..

976
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:35,292
..god knows what he'll do to you!

977
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:37,083
I hope that everything gets alright.
That's why I'm telling you.

978
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:38,500
Will you sit in my lap now?!

979
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,458
Firstly, I'm saving your life.
And even then you..

980
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:44,125
Look.. we'll disappear.

981
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,583
Even he'll forget after some days.

982
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:47,792
Just like the others.

983
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:51,583
He is not like the others.
This is Jassi! Jassi Don!

984
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:53,542
He'll find you even from hell.

985
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:57,083
You know, I really didn't want to.

986
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,375
But old habits die hard.

987
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:00,208
Seeing the money,
I couldn't control myself.

988
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,792
And I did it.

989
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,208
What shall we do now?

990
01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:06,583
Shall I tell you? Will you listen?

991
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:07,208
Yes.

992
01:00:07,792 --> 01:00:09,708
Run!!! Hurry up! Get up! Get up!

993
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:11,625
Hey! money.. money!

994
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:16,708
Hurry..
- Purse.. purse..

995
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:18,542
Come on.. come on!
- Come on.. come!

996
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:23,167
Come fast!

997
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:25,750
What are you doing?

998
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:30,458
Yuck! The lads these
days don't have any shame!

999
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,542
Come.

1000
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:46,667
Sister-in-law should be before
me within half an hour. Else..

1001
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,292
Don't show me your
faces after half an hour.

1002
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,375
Yes, boss.

1003
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:04,167
Had we been late by even
a minute Naari would have been..

1004
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,417
..crushed and Pinku
would have been thrashed.

1005
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:09,875
Oh, God, show us a way, please.

1006
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,667
Please. Please. Please.

1007
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,708
Oh, God, show us a way, please.

1008
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:16,208
Please. Please..
- Stupid!

1009
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:17,250
There is an easy way.

1010
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,208
Return this money
and beg for your life.

1011
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:20,750
Are you out of your mind?

1012
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,750
No, no, I...I am feeling very scared.

1013
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:24,292
I can't do it.

1014
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:25,042
Scared?

1015
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:26,458
You didn't feel scared while stealing.

1016
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:27,875
Are you feeling scared
while returning it?

1017
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:28,833
It is simple.

1018
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:29,708
Go to Jazzy and tell him..

1019
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:31,250
Mr. Jazzy, please, I am sorry.

1020
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,583
Take your money and let me go.

1021
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:33,708
Mr. Pinku.

1022
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,167
From Pinku to Mr. Pinku?

1023
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:41,875
Yes.

1024
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,833
What do you want?

1025
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:48,667
Please go and return this bag.

1026
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,542
For my sake.

1027
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:52,958
Please.

1028
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:54,375
I?

1029
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,917
Return the bag to Jazzy?

1030
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:00,208
Run away.

1031
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:00,958
Are you crazy?

1032
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:02,125
Do you want to get me killed?

1033
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:03,833
It mean you will disturb
a hornets' nest..

1034
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:04,625
..and I should get stung!

1035
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:07,250
Do you think I am an idiot?

1036
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:09,292
What? What?

1037
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:11,292
What happened?

1038
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:15,875
If I had a kin, he would
never have left me like this..

1039
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,292
..in times of trouble.

1040
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:22,708
How would you know the
sufferings of an orphan?

1041
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,875
You can never understand it.

1042
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:26,875
Never.

1043
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,208
Orphan?

1044
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:32,458
I had talked to your father on phone.

1045
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,417
He used such abusive
words and banged the phone.

1046
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,625
Orphan?

1047
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,042
But my mother?

1048
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,333
She is bedridden since two months.

1049
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:47,417
Pinkesh, I am forced to do
all this for her surgery for cancer.

1050
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,125
We have no other option.

1051
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:50,375
Dance class.

1052
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:51,542
What?

1053
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:55,167
When I had called up your
mother was in dance class.

1054
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:59,500
And she said that if she
spots you she will break your legs.

1055
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,625
2000.

1056
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:02,583
2000?

1057
01:03:03,042 --> 01:03:05,375
2000 is enough for delivering a bag.

1058
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,333
Oh, I am..

1059
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:09,667
Am I going to deliver a pizza?

1060
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,542
Okay, 5000. Happy?

1061
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:14,958
Um..

1062
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:18,125
Oh, bargaining?

1063
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,458
Okay, fine. Tell me.

1064
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,625
Tell me how much you want?

1065
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,000
You are a cheat.

1066
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:22,958
Go on, blackmail me.

1067
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:25,083
Well, since you are my friend,
it will be 100 thousand.

1068
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:26,000
100 thousand?

1069
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:27,292
Quiet, quiet.

1070
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,375
Do you want to get both of us killed?

1071
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,458
Are you out of your mind?

1072
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:31,417
100 thousand for a one minute job?

1073
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,333
This is robbing.

1074
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:35,667
Twenty rounds get fired in one minute.

1075
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,792
Who will face that risk?

1076
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:38,583
Fine. Agree if you
wish or else I am going.

1077
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:39,042
Bye.

1078
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,417
Just a minute.

1079
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,958
Mr. Pinku, you get so angry.

1080
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:45,292
It will give you wrinkled face.

1081
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:46,917
You won't look nice.

1082
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,042
100 thousand, right?

1083
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,792
Okay, done.
- Done?

1084
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,708
Done.
- Sure?

1085
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,583
Yes, yes, of course.

1086
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:58,625
Okay, come.

1087
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:00,292
But before that we have
to go somewhere else, okay?

1088
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:01,125
Where do we have to go?

1089
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,042
To Dev's house.
- To Dev's house?

1090
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,958
My passport is there.

1091
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:07,333
It is better to leave
the country rather than die.

1092
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:08,708
You mean out of India?

1093
01:04:08,792 --> 01:04:10,333
No, no,
if Jazzy gets back his money..

1094
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:11,458
Come on.

1095
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,292
Okay, let us go.

1096
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,875
I need to go to washroom.

1097
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,292
I have been waiting since a long time.

1098
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,583
What..

1099
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:33,458
Come. Come on, hurry up.

1100
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:34,250
What should I do?

1101
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,000
Wait here and whistle for you?

1102
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:37,750
What are you doing? Hurry up.

1103
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,750
Wait for two minutes.
I can't find the keys.

1104
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:41,750
I am getting desperate.

1105
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:42,833
Let us go.

1106
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:48,875
There is nobody.

1107
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:52,875
I can't see anything.

1108
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:00,792
Quiet!

1109
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:01,750
Don't scream.

1110
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,167
Didn't you want to go to washroom?

1111
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:03,667
Yes, I am going.

1112
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:04,583
I will go and get the passport.

1113
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:05,500
Okay, okay.

1114
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:09,958
It was not my fault.

1115
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:15,417
I forgot to switch off
the lights in the bathroom.

1116
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,875
There was a robbery at the bank.

1117
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,708
Why would I commit a robbery?

1118
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:24,250
I was about to be
jailed in a rape case.

1119
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,833
Why would I commit rape?

1120
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:31,125
And they escaped with 25
lakh rupees within 10 minutes.

1121
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:31,542
Hello.

1122
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,500
'CCTV cameras recorded..'

1123
01:05:35,042 --> 01:05:35,667
'..and the police..'

1124
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:39,042
Oh, the taxi driver.

1125
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,250
Yes.

1126
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,375
But you crashed with my car, right?

1127
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:49,083
Okay, sir, let us make
an out of court settlement.

1128
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:54,458
Sir, 50,000 is too much.

1129
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:58,125
Hello. Boss, I am speaking.

1130
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,125
Pinkesh.

1131
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,417
Pinku, what happened to your voice?

1132
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,667
I got a sore throat due to running.

1133
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,458
How can throat get
affected by running?

1134
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:07,875
I was shouting while
running after Naari.

1135
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,750
Naari, stop. Naari, stop.

1136
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:13,792
Did you find Naari?

1137
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:14,958
Where can I meet her?
How do I meet her?

1138
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:16,292
Pinku, please tell me quickly.

1139
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:18,458
Don't ask so many questions.

1140
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:19,833
I am unable to speak.

1141
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:21,000
Do one thing.

1142
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:25,667
Quickly come to Sector 10,
Vintage Lounge, okay?

1143
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,667
Hurry up, hurry up. Hurry up!

1144
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,750
I am coming there.
I will be there.

1145
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:31,000
You will be James Bond some day.

1146
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:48,125
100 thousand.

1147
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,458
Delivery first.

1148
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:58,792
Give me your passport.

1149
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:00,792
Passport? Why?

1150
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:03,000
What if you run away?

1151
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,708
Don't you trust me?

1152
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:10,667
No.

1153
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,458
Listen, keep it safely,
in inner pocket, okay?

1154
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:23,250
Give it. Is it real?

1155
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:27,875
Okay. Mama's eyes.

1156
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,917
"Come on. Come on."

1157
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:36,375
"Be my guest."

1158
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:37,625
"Be my guest."

1159
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:39,458
He was scared.

1160
01:07:39,542 --> 01:07:41,875
But Naari was a master of the game.

1161
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,042
She was dangling bait before him..

1162
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,167
..and making him do tricks.

1163
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:49,833
Hey, wait.

1164
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,250
Wait. Where are you going?

1165
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:58,208
I am the delivery boy.

1166
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:03,250
What are you saying?

1167
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,417
I have come to make a delivery.

1168
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:06,583
What are you going to deliver?

1169
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,583
Had someone ordered
butter-lentil curry?

1170
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:12,083
Have you brought butter-lentil
curry in a suitcase?

1171
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:13,750
Well?

1172
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:15,417
If is a very eco-friendly restaurant.

1173
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,042
We don't use plastic.

1174
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:18,917
Your hotel is very neat.

1175
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,708
Yes.

1176
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:21,583
How much is the bill?

1177
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:24,292
180 rupees.

1178
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:30,292
I don't have change.

1179
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,000
No problem.

1180
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:32,292
I will get it from the boss.

1181
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:33,083
No problem.

1182
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:35,750
Listen, wait here only.
- Okay.

1183
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:36,875
Don't move.

1184
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:38,458
Hold this.

1185
01:08:39,417 --> 01:08:40,708
Hold this!

1186
01:08:41,292 --> 01:08:44,000
Listen, don't eat it.
It is mine.

1187
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:48,625
What is this?

1188
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:56,333
Get out. Get out.

1189
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:57,542
Open.

1190
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:01,083
Idiot, a suitcase contains money,
not lentil.

1191
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:02,958
I can't see anybody here.

1192
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:07,750
Hey, wait!

1193
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,417
Catch him. Catch him.

1194
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,625
They are chasing me!

1195
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,125
They are chasing me!

1196
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:17,792
I am in big trouble.
Very big.

1197
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,833
What happened?
Did you give the bag?

1198
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:24,375
They are chasing me!

1199
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:25,250
Let us go.

1200
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:26,125
Forget the bag.

1201
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:30,917
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1202
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:36,917
The scoundrel ran away.

1203
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,917
He ran away.

1204
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,542
He slipped from our hands.

1205
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:40,667
Jazzy is just..

1206
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,375
My stomach is aching.

1207
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:43,250
My stomach..

1208
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:50,750
Here.

1209
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:53,875
Passport.

1210
01:09:58,625 --> 01:09:59,583
Thanks.

1211
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:02,625
I guess it's over.
- Yeah.

1212
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,583
Will we meet again?
- No.

1213
01:10:05,542 --> 01:10:06,625
You should meet Dev once.

1214
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:08,542
He is waiting for
you at Vintage Lounge.

1215
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:12,792
It will be a bit difficult
for him to forget me.

1216
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,000
Make up some excuse, okay?

1217
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:17,542
May I ask something?
- No.

1218
01:10:18,292 --> 01:10:20,042
Did you ever love Dev?

1219
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,250
What are you saying?

1220
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,458
Even now I love Dev.

1221
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:27,125
What?

1222
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:28,625
Then why did you leave him?

1223
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,042
For Jazzy.

1224
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,917
Then why did you leave Jazzy?

1225
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:37,167
Well, if you say so, for you.

1226
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,000
Oh, my God.

1227
01:10:41,417 --> 01:10:43,708
Okay. Look, you are not my type.

1228
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,625
I am very choosy, okay?

1229
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,042
You are not choosy, you are chicken.

1230
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:52,333
When you had located
me why didn't you tell Dev?

1231
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,542
I didn't tell him because
his heart would have broken.

1232
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:59,167
Were you saving his heart
or were you losing your heart?

1233
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,708
Okay, bye.

1234
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,542
Listen.
- Yes?

1235
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,292
Take care.

1236
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:10,000
You too.

1237
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:12,833
Change your deo.

1238
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,125
You are..

1239
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:15,042
What?

1240
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:29,125
"Why should even your
memory remain in my thoughts?"

1241
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:35,833
"Like this you.."

1242
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,458
I have harboured an enemy.

1243
01:11:38,542 --> 01:11:40,208
You know that don't you?

1244
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:43,292
Now I will have to pay for it.

1245
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:53,417
"There should be no space between us."

1246
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,500
How are you, my friend?

1247
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:57,750
Sorry, I am a bit late.

1248
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:04,000
Let us search over there.

1249
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:04,750
Where did he run away?

1250
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:05,500
Come on. There.

1251
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:06,208
Come.
- Okay, come.

1252
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:07,750
I will go to
the washroom for minute.

1253
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:08,917
You can drink.

1254
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:13,792
Drink.

1255
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,292
Start. Thank you.

1256
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:17,000
There he is.

1257
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:17,625
Rascal.

1258
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,958
Come on hurry up.

1259
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,750
Just a minute.
What happened?

1260
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:25,375
Why are you beating me?

1261
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:26,583
Rascal.

1262
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:28,708
Punch him.

1263
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:29,833
Oh, ouch.

1264
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:31,625
Mamma's eyes.

1265
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:33,833
No, no.

1266
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:34,833
Okay.

1267
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:43,167
Idiot, not the goggles,
take off your clothes.

1268
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:50,208
Light tight.

1269
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:51,542
Mister.

1270
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:52,417
Mister, come.

1271
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,458
Take it off.
- No problem. Take your time.

1272
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:55,125
There is no hurry.

1273
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:56,042
May I go now?

1274
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,833
Take off your pants also.

1275
01:12:57,917 --> 01:12:59,958
Promise me that you
won't misbehave with me.

1276
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,125
Are you a girl?

1277
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:03,000
Would I misbehave with you?

1278
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:05,000
Take it off.

1279
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,208
This is the perfect position.

1280
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:14,833
What is this? Shall I slap you?

1281
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:16,583
Just a minute.
Why are you beating me now?

1282
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:17,917
I have taken off everything for you.

1283
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,042
Didn't I take it off?

1284
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,500
I want to go home.

1285
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:21,333
I have got a wife and children.

1286
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:22,583
My children will be orphaned.

1287
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,792
No problem, we will bring them up.

1288
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:27,042
Look, mister,
I have given you your things.

1289
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,750
Now let me take my
things and let me go.

1290
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,708
I am of no use to you,
I swear.

1291
01:13:30,792 --> 01:13:33,500
I am of no use to anybody,
I swear.

1292
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:34,583
Please.

1293
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,417
Excuse me, my phone is ringing.

1294
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,875
Pick up the phone.

1295
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:51,542
No, no, I..
- Talk.

1296
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,458
Listen, I am not making idle talk.

1297
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:57,875
You will feel these vibrations
of the phone in your tummy..

1298
01:13:57,958 --> 01:14:00,333
..for the rest of your life.

1299
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:01,417
Pick it up.

1300
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:03,000
Pick it up!

1301
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:04,542
Put it on speaker.

1302
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,375
Have you gone to
sleep in the washroom?

1303
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:08,458
Where are you?

1304
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:12,292
Boss? Boss has left.
- What?

1305
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:14,292
What do you mean he left?

1306
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:16,167
When did he leave?
How did he leave?

1307
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:19,292
I will die. Stop joking.

1308
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:20,167
I am not joking.

1309
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,833
I had a meeting, so..

1310
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,083
Meeting?

1311
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:27,000
I had told you that
I forgot my wallet at home.

1312
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:28,875
My friend, you don't understand..

1313
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:30,125
Brother, it is my father's phone.

1314
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:30,958
It is my father's phone.

1315
01:14:31,042 --> 01:14:32,625
Am I going to eat it?

1316
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:35,750
Boss, what is ass?

1317
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:41,500
It must be what this man
wanted to do with boss's money.

1318
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:42,042
Yes.

1319
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:43,542
I will..

1320
01:14:43,917 --> 01:14:45,208
Your ass.

1321
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:47,417
Ass.

1322
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,292
That is not the case.

1323
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:50,000
I had returned your money.

1324
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:50,958
Now what?

1325
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,542
Bend down.

1326
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:53,375
Don't ask him to bend down.

1327
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:55,167
Let me sit on his back
and make him run like a horse.

1328
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,167
I will make him trot.

1329
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:58,708
Final?

1330
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,125
Someone wants me to bend,
someone wants me to be a horse.

1331
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:01,208
What do I do?

1332
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:02,167
Bend.

1333
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:02,750
Come on, bend.

1334
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,167
Final?
- Yes.

1335
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:07,458
Don't mess up okay?

1336
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,417
Here is Kaniya Kadam.

1337
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:18,625
Now my story starts.

1338
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:23,667
In my stories there is
less of talk and more of action.

1339
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:28,417
Your mama's eye.

1340
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:29,792
Who is coming?

1341
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,125
My brother Jazzy is coming.

1342
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:32,333
Jazzy!

1343
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:38,958
Jazz...Jazz...Hail brother Jazzy.

1344
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:41,417
Jazzy, if you had called me,
I would've definitely come.

1345
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,917
Forgive me. Please forgive me.

1346
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,208
Please don't kill me.

1347
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:47,208
My blood dries up on seeing you.

1348
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:49,750
What will you gain by killing me?

1349
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:50,792
Was this the man?

1350
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:51,792
Yes, boss.

1351
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:55,958
What were you doing?

1352
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:57,083
Well?

1353
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:58,000
I..

1354
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:02,458
I had come to return your bag.

1355
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:03,708
I knew there was something
of value for you..

1356
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:04,958
..so I thought of returning your bag..

1357
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:07,708
..and I will take
my things and go home.

1358
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:08,875
So I..
- Open.

1359
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,458
This is the last brief.
There is nothing underneath.

1360
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:13,375
I will not take it off.

1361
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:15,208
Open the bag. The bag.

1362
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:18,042
How can I open your bag?

1363
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,667
Idiot, open the bag!

1364
01:16:20,917 --> 01:16:22,000
Hurry up.

1365
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:23,625
Idiot.

1366
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,000
Here, I have opened it.

1367
01:16:29,667 --> 01:16:31,625
Oh!

1368
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:37,000
Panties. Bra.

1369
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:39,583
There should be bundles of cash.

1370
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:41,167
Where are they?

1371
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:49,917
You will tell us about that.

1372
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:51,875
Idiot.

1373
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,542
Where is it?

1374
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,083
I...bag..

1375
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:00,083
Naari. Naari.

1376
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:02,000
Naari has done everything.

1377
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:02,750
Do you know..

1378
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:04,000
Idiot!

1379
01:17:04,083 --> 01:17:05,708
Please driver faster.

1380
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,958
Madam, this is a car not a rocket.

1381
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:09,875
Brother, push the accelerator.

1382
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,542
It will turn into a rocket.

1383
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:14,375
Hurry. Hurry.
Everybody is in a hurry.

1384
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:15,917
Did you say something?

1385
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:26,125
So, shall I start,
or will you say it?

1386
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:30,750
You start, because you are
the opening batsman of our team.

1387
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:35,958
It so happened that I got
injured while playing cricket..

1388
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:37,292
..and I landed up in a hospital.

1389
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:41,000
There she was responsible
for taking care of me.

1390
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:42,708
She was my nurse.

1391
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:47,083
And the nurse became
a patient while treating him.

1392
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:50,750
After he was discharged
from the hospital..

1393
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,583
..my life has become
empty like a syringe..

1394
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:57,542
..and worthless like expired medicine.

1395
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:59,708
Then I called him to meet me.

1396
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:07,125
Kamal, you are not aspirin for me,
you are paracitamol.

1397
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:10,792
Look, don't throw a googley.

1398
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,125
Tell me clearly.

1399
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,625
You are my oxygen supply.

1400
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,833
Without it feels like an open
heart surgery without anaesthesia.

1401
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:25,333
Come to the pitch.

1402
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:27,125
Why are you throwing wide balls?

1403
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:34,708
I want to ask if there is
place for my heart in your life line?

1404
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:35,792
What?

1405
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:39,708
Cricket was my life and
I was about to refuse her.

1406
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:42,208
Then a miracle happened.

1407
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:47,000
Oh, God.

1408
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,000
Oh, God, are you all right?

1409
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,125
Are you okay?

1410
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:59,917
And at that moment she
looked like my World Cup.

1411
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:03,917
You hadn't even
got your breath back..

1412
01:19:04,792 --> 01:19:06,458
..when you proposed to me.

1413
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:12,292
One, two, three.

1414
01:19:18,625 --> 01:19:19,750
What is this?

1415
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:21,708
Our dream home.

1416
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:26,750
Are you serious?

1417
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:28,875
This is our...

1418
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:32,208
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1419
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:34,500
Oh, my God.

1420
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,917
I love you.

1421
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:39,667
Dev, this must be
very expensive, right?

1422
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:42,750
Yes, I have taken
a loan of 20 million.

1423
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:45,333
All my savings..
- Savings.

1424
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,125
And I had to sell off my land also.

1425
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:49,750
For you.

1426
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:50,958
Did you like it?

1427
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:53,667
Isn't it? Isn't it?

1428
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:54,875
Isn't it?

1429
01:19:54,958 --> 01:20:00,583
Wow! Yes. Great.

1430
01:20:02,417 --> 01:20:04,250
What are you doing?
- What?

1431
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,125
By the way,
there is one more surprise for you.

1432
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:07,750
One more?

1433
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:09,708
Bigger than this?

1434
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:10,917
No, not bigger. A small one.

1435
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I have got your tiny
clothes collected from PG.

1436
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:16,333
Both of us will stay here, right?

1437
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:17,250
Yes.

1438
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:18,250
Right?

1439
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:21,167
I and you..

1440
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:26,375
Will you..

1441
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:29,083
Dev, hold the thought,
I will be back in two minutes, okay?

1442
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:30,167
From washroom.

1443
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:32,417
Okay.

1444
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:39,542
When girls suspect proposal,
they can escape to only two places.

1445
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,750
Court room and washroom.

1446
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:44,250
Court room gets them married..

1447
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:46,417
..and washroom gives them freedom.

1448
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,458
It is not that Naari didn't love Dev.

1449
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:54,042
If you keep a dog for
four days you begin to love it.

1450
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:04,125
And he became useless for Naari.

1451
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:06,208
The idiot has already
come under debt..

1452
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:08,583
..by buying the house on loan.

1453
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:29,250
Lady, are you hurt?

1454
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:37,292
Goochie.
- No, Jazzy.

1455
01:21:38,292 --> 01:21:39,750
Well?

1456
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:55,708
Iron hand and God's grace.

1457
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:57,833
I knew only two things.

1458
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:03,083
But two minutes ago
I didn't know what love is.

1459
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:07,917
In two minutes all
my feelings changed..

1460
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,583
..when love bloomed.

1461
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:18,042
Beby Doll, come.

1462
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,375
Sister-in-law.
- Come. Come.

1463
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:20,000
Hello.

1464
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:21,125
Close the door.

1465
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:21,625
Come.

1466
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,000
Hail brother Jazzy.

1467
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:27,333
Oh, she fainted.

1468
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:30,125
Hadn't I forbidden you not to
fire guns in front of sister-in-law?

1469
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,917
You scared my dear Naari.

1470
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Baby.

1471
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:35,292
Idiot!

1472
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:36,167
Baby.

1473
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:36,958
Hello.

1474
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:56,750
"I feel like loving you very much."

1475
01:22:56,833 --> 01:23:01,000
"Darling hug me, I am your don."

1476
01:23:01,417 --> 01:23:04,000
"On seeing you
- Ting tong."

1477
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:06,500
"Darling, my mind says
- Ting tong."

1478
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,292
"On seeing you
- Ting tong."

1479
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:15,667
"Darling, my mind says
- Ting tong."

1480
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:20,208
"Whenever you come before
me my temperature rises."

1481
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:23,458
"My mind goes crazy."

1482
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:29,708
"You smile at me and my heart blooms."

1483
01:23:29,792 --> 01:23:34,333
"I get drunk on water,
my heart blooms."

1484
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:39,083
"You smile at me and my heart blooms."

1485
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:44,167
"I get drunk on water,
my heart blooms."

1486
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:48,500
"I feel like loving you very much."

1487
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:52,833
"Darling hug me, I am your don."

1488
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:58,250
"My house is like a palace,
you will live in it."

1489
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:02,500
"I have dated one girl,
I won't date again."

1490
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:07,292
"Many girls hover around
me but when you come before me.."

1491
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:10,542
"My mind goes crazy."

1492
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,667
"You smile at me and my heart blooms."

1493
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:21,333
"I get drunk on water,
my heart blooms."

1494
01:24:21,417 --> 01:24:26,083
"You smile at me and my heart blooms."

1495
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:30,917
"I get drunk on water,
my heart blooms."

1496
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,208
"He was stung by love bug."

1497
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:35,583
"The don was lost somewhere."

1498
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:37,833
"He used to drink many bottles."

1499
01:24:37,917 --> 01:24:40,250
"Today he got drunk on water."

1500
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:42,667
"He used to have gunfights."

1501
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,958
"Today he has become a Romeo."

1502
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:50,292
"Publish the news
that he is Majnu's son."

1503
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:59,375
"Heroines wait on
my and run after me."

1504
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:03,833
"Bollywood's heroes call me a hero."

1505
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:06,083
"They call me Bullet Bomb."

1506
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:11,708
"When you come before
me the bomb becomes dud."

1507
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:19,167
"You smile at me and my heart blooms."

1508
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:23,083
"I get drunk on water,
my heart blooms."

1509
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:27,125
"You smile at me and my heart blooms."

1510
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:31,250
"I get drunk on water,
my heart blooms."

1511
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:35,167
"I feel like loving you very much."

1512
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:39,167
"Darling hug me, I am your don."

1513
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:43,208
"I feel like loving you very much."

1514
01:25:43,292 --> 01:25:47,542
"Darling hug me, I am your don."

1515
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:53,375
Listen, girl,
this time Naari has not met Dev.

1516
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:55,042
She has met Mahadev.

1517
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:57,500
Watch the twist in the tale.

1518
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,792
Make the packets properly.

1519
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:02,292
The bundles should not break.

1520
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:05,042
Don't worry,
boss, I will make perfect packets.

1521
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:07,208
Don't address me as boss.

1522
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:09,125
I am younger than you.

1523
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:13,167
Okay, Jazzy,
I will call you Jazzy.

1524
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:16,542
I mean..
- I am not that younger also.

1525
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:19,625
Okay? Address me as sir.

1526
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,333
Okay, boss.
- What?

1527
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:22,375
I mean, sir.

1528
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:25,833
Come on, hurry up.
Your sister-in-law will be coming.

1529
01:26:25,917 --> 01:26:29,292
By the way, brother...sir,
why don't we give up this business..

1530
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,917
..and start some new work?

1531
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,917
You see we are losing
value in the market.

1532
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,083
I see.

1533
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:38,000
Do you have a new business
plan in your mind?

1534
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:40,792
Hadn't we thought that
thing at the time of Big Boss?

1535
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,292
Have you forgotten what
had happened at that time?

1536
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:45,042
Shall I show you the flashback?

1537
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:45,792
Come.

1538
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,250
Come.

1539
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:50,792
Mr. Hooda, with the prices
falling and rising inflation..

1540
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:52,833
..nobody is investing in land.

1541
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:55,125
What is the use of possessing land?

1542
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:58,250
And in the business of drugs
the police have become very alert.

1543
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:01,333
Give bribes here
and grease palms there.

1544
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:05,250
A few days ago I was watching the TV..

1545
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:09,250
..and I realised that the business
of painting is very profitable.

1546
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:13,042
Had I known it in my school
days I would have become a painter.

1547
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,667
A couples of brush
strokes and high prices.

1548
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:20,167
Uncover it.

1549
01:27:23,292 --> 01:27:24,417
What is this?

1550
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:25,833
This?

1551
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:30,292
Have you covered a
canvass with covered tar?

1552
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,917
Sir, this is a painting. A painting.

1553
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,542
This is the universe.

1554
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:39,958
It means the whole of the universe.

1555
01:27:40,042 --> 01:27:44,125
This is our Mother Earth.

1556
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:46,375
Hail Mother Earth.
- Hail!

1557
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:49,458
Who told you that?

1558
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:51,542
Brother, the painter told me.

1559
01:27:52,042 --> 01:27:55,375
You have wasted my 20 million.

1560
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:59,167
Brother, this is not black paint.
This is art.

1561
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:01,083
This art looks incomplete.

1562
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,542
It looks incomplete?

1563
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:07,750
Bubble gum?

1564
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,000
What is this?

1565
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,458
Now it is complete.

1566
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:12,708
How, brother?

1567
01:28:13,042 --> 01:28:16,458
Moon is also
there with Mother Earth.

1568
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:20,875
Yes.

1569
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:22,375
Move aside!

1570
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,708
Are you trying to fool me?

1571
01:28:24,792 --> 01:28:30,625
You wasted 20 million
rupees on this cheap painting?

1572
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:33,000
Brother. Brother.

1573
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:34,708
Flashback is over.

1574
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:35,875
Come back.

1575
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:38,292
Got it?

1576
01:28:38,667 --> 01:28:40,542
Art is not our cup of tea.

1577
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:44,292
Whichever building we buy
we will break and build new.

1578
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,542
Right?

1579
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,208
Come on, hurry up.

1580
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:48,042
Businessman.

1581
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,542
Hi, baby.

1582
01:28:50,042 --> 01:28:52,250
Oh, my Baby Doll.

1583
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,542
Baby Doll, just a minute.

1584
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:56,625
Let me finish packing
then we will go, okay?

1585
01:28:57,583 --> 01:29:01,250
Yes. Do your work.
Take your time.

1586
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:05,000
No problem,
I will wait outside.

1587
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:08,708
My Baby Doll.

1588
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:12,542
Hurry up.

1589
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,708
Idiot. Stupid.

1590
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:19,875
What is your daddy's name?

1591
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:22,375
Subhash Chaudhary.

1592
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:27,792
And Hooda man kept talking.

1593
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,167
I punched him.

1594
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:32,875
He stopped talking
and his breathing stopped.

1595
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:37,125
So did Hood die?

1596
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:41,875
No, my Baby Doll,
you get scared so easily.

1597
01:29:42,792 --> 01:29:48,833
He fainted and then my
didlo also had a go at him.

1598
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:49,792
Dildo,

1599
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:54,208
Dildo, my bull dog.

1600
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,792
Bull dog?
- Yes.

1601
01:29:56,875 --> 01:30:00,292
Have you named your
bull dog as Dildo?

1602
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,125
Yes.

1603
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:04,292
He was lying outside
some toy shop in Bangkok.

1604
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:08,917
I liked him very much
and I named him Doldo.

1605
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,917
Hey, mind your head
or else I will get angry.

1606
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:16,833
What?
- Jazzy.

1607
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:18,000
What?

1608
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:19,500
Are you getting angry?

1609
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:23,458
No, please, it's okay.

1610
01:30:25,417 --> 01:30:27,208
Don, it happens

1611
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,250
It was my mistake. Pardon me.

1612
01:30:32,458 --> 01:30:37,417
If I hit you with a
bat you will learn a lesson.

1613
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:39,833
Jazzy, please. It's okay.

1614
01:30:39,917 --> 01:30:40,667
Cool down.

1615
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:42,375
It's okay. It's okay.

1616
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:43,750
It's okay.

1617
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:48,417
Look, you are..
You're going to make the country proud.

1618
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:50,917
I am sorry.

1619
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,583
It's human to err.

1620
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:55,833
Forgive me as your younger brother.

1621
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:59,833
Give me your address.
I will send a brand-new helmet.

1622
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:02,500
Okay. Okay. Next time be careful.

1623
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,458
What a boring man!
- Forget it.

1624
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,083
As you say, master.

1625
01:31:10,125 --> 01:31:11,375
Okay.
- Yes.

1626
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:14,500
Where were we?
- De ildo.

1627
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:18,083
Yes. Dildo barked so loudly that..

1628
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:20,500
..the oldie regained
consciousness immediately.

1629
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,875
My little Dildo is very cute.

1630
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:27,042
Long live our boss!

1631
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,208
Hey! Politely.

1632
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:32,208
It's a restaurant.

1633
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:36,542
Brother, we need to speak to you.

1634
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,125
Say it in my ear.

1635
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:46,208
Scoundrel!

1636
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,750
He won't give my money.

1637
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:52,083
Get it from him anyhow.

1638
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:54,583
No. Do one thing.

1639
01:31:54,792 --> 01:31:59,375
Make him naked. And flog
him so badly that he vomits blood.

1640
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,917
Okay.
- No. Do one thing.

1641
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,250
Rip his skin apart.

1642
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,167
Chop his body into small pieces.

1643
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,958
My bulldog..

1644
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:10,875
Baby, what is my dog's name?

1645
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,125
Dildo.

1646
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:14,375
Yes. Feed it to Dildo.

1647
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,000
Alright, brother.
- Go.

1648
01:32:16,292 --> 01:32:17,792
Come on.
- Yes.

1649
01:32:17,875 --> 01:32:18,875
Let's go.

1650
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:20,917
He will lock horns with me.

1651
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,667
Oh God!

1652
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:29,708
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1653
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:36,708
I mean don't worry.
I will find her. Okay?

1654
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:38,458
Pinku, you don't
understand my condition.

1655
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:40,583
I have taken a loan
of 2 crores to buy a house.

1656
01:33:15,417 --> 01:33:17,375
Sister, brother will
buy a new top for you.

1657
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:18,833
Bye.

1658
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:32,250
It's tangy spice. Homemade.

1659
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:34,750
Add it to buttermilk.
It will taste even better.

1660
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,833
I will also add it.
It's good for the stomach too.

1661
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:40,417
Spice.
- Yes.

1662
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,583
Homemade.
- Sorry.

1663
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:45,708
Take it.
- Cheers.

1664
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:47,750
Cheers.

1665
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:55,000
Isn't it bitter?
- A little. Healthy things are bitter.

1666
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,125
It will be good.

1667
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:58,375
I will just come in two
minutes from the washroom.

1668
01:33:58,458 --> 01:33:59,792
Okay?
- Yes.

1669
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,833
Found her?

1670
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:25,625
No, brother.
I searched the entire room.

1671
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:27,000
But I didn't find
sister-in-law anywhere.

1672
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:28,125
Your car has been found.

1673
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,875
Go and get the car.
- Okay, brother.

1674
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,583
Brother, forgive me.

1675
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:39,125
I didn't know she has
mixed something in the pill.

1676
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:43,833
She spiked my drink too.

1677
01:34:44,792 --> 01:34:47,417
We didn't expect
sister-in-law to do this.

1678
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:49,958
That's where we went wrong, brother.

1679
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:54,625
Shut up!

1680
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,250
Will you turn me deaf?

1681
01:34:57,417 --> 01:35:01,750
Okay. How do you feel now?

1682
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:06,042
Brother, I am riled.

1683
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:09,125
Silly boy.

1684
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:12,958
I am also riled.

1685
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,625
Morons!

1686
01:35:17,708 --> 01:35:21,750
Why have you made my
life miserable in old age?

1687
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:23,583
You are making so much noise.

1688
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:27,125
Will you dig the
ground to extract oil?

1689
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:30,042
Aunt, we are doing flooring work.

1690
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,417
Cover your ears with cotton.

1691
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,958
You got 50 lakhs for this place,
didn't you?

1692
01:35:35,042 --> 01:35:37,500
Go. Go for a holiday.

1693
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:38,958
Visit holy places.

1694
01:35:39,042 --> 01:35:40,917
Or go to Bangkok for a massage.

1695
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,167
Fine?
- Shut up.

1696
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,792
Or else I will call the cops.

1697
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:47,375
Look at this.
She will call the cops.

1698
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:49,708
But the work..
- Will go on.

1699
01:35:49,792 --> 01:35:50,542
Yes.

1700
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:54,917
Aunt, I will call the Lord
of Death for you before the cops come.

1701
01:35:55,542 --> 01:35:57,375
Now let me enjoy this demolition.

1702
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:59,250
My entire day was bad.

1703
01:35:59,542 --> 01:36:01,083
Now don't spoil my mood.

1704
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:05,167
I am behaving decently.
Let me remain decent.

1705
01:36:05,917 --> 01:36:10,000
Forget it.
Who will argue with these goons?

1706
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:13,208
If you say something,
they resort to violence.

1707
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,875
Get lost.

1708
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:20,917
'When the old lady called me a goon,
I didn't like it.'

1709
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:24,875
'Once you start leading
a decent life..'

1710
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,917
'..hooliganism really
seems like a bad thing.'

1711
01:36:28,458 --> 01:36:31,833
'But it was true. I was a goon.'

1712
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:50,125
'I had learnt wrestling
to win medals and settle down.'

1713
01:36:50,542 --> 01:36:53,417
'But I was using it
to break people's bones.'

1714
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:57,250
'Committing murders,
seizing people's homes.'

1715
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:02,833
'I kept doing it blindly
on my boss's saying.'

1716
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:05,708
'One day I realized my mistake.'

1717
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,375
'And the business went for a toss.'

1718
01:37:07,458 --> 01:37:10,833
'The boss was crazy about painting.'

1719
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:14,083
'I tackled him and
everybody made me the boss.'

1720
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:16,458
'I was elated to be the boss.'

1721
01:37:30,417 --> 01:37:32,458
'I was happy to be the boss.'

1722
01:37:32,542 --> 01:37:36,583
'But at times I would
feel a void in my life.'

1723
01:37:36,667 --> 01:37:38,625
'I didn't know what void it was.'

1724
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:47,167
'Then one day I saw
my life lying on the floor.'

1725
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:51,375
'And I have not learnt
to lose opportunities.'

1726
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:57,458
'With her hand in mine,
my life took a u-turn.'

1727
01:37:58,042 --> 01:38:00,958
'I changed.'

1728
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:09,292
'And it was unbelievable
that a woman would dupe..'

1729
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:14,042
'..the great Jazzy who
used to trounce everyone.'

1730
01:38:15,542 --> 01:38:17,708
Think straight.
Think straight.

1731
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:19,583
We will find her.
We will find her.

1732
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:20,792
I will shoot her
when I will find her.

1733
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:21,750
Sir.

1734
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:23,625
First find her.

1735
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:27,292
Shame on such a don.

1736
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:29,417
A girl duped me.

1737
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:32,792
Brother.
- What?

1738
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:34,042
Give me Rs.180.

1739
01:38:36,042 --> 01:38:38,542
Kundan,
why do you need so much money?

1740
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:39,875
A hotel boy has come.

1741
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:41,708
He has brought creamy
lentil in a suitcase.

1742
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:43,208
He wants Rs.180 for that.

1743
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:44,625
Creamy lentil in a suitcase?

1744
01:38:45,625 --> 01:38:47,583
Have you lost your mind?

1745
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:49,708
Show me who has come. Come on.
- Let's go.

1746
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:52,542
Naari!

1747
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:56,917
Idiot. Not lentil,
but money is kept in a suitcase.

1748
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,333
Who is it? Show me.

1749
01:38:58,417 --> 01:39:00,000
There is nobody here.

1750
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:04,458
Stop!

1751
01:39:04,917 --> 01:39:06,417
Catch him! Catch him!

1752
01:39:07,167 --> 01:39:12,542
Catch him!
Catch him! Catch him!

1753
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:19,500
Naari went away.

1754
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:24,125
But when she was leaving,
the clacking sound of her heels..

1755
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:29,333
..matched the beats of my heart.

1756
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:42,792
Hello.

1757
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:44,125
Hello.

1758
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:48,167
Jazzy, I want to give
you some important news.

1759
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:49,708
Naari.

1760
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:54,417
Not Naari. I...I am a hunter.

1761
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:59,875
Look, I know who stole your
bag and where he is right now.

1762
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:02,875
Naari, meet me once.
Please. Please.

1763
01:40:02,958 --> 01:40:05,500
I am a hunter.
I told you.

1764
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:09,583
Look. I know where your bag is.

1765
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:14,167
But for this information you will
have to deposit 1 lakh in my account.

1766
01:40:14,542 --> 01:40:16,167
I will send you the
account number right away.

1767
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:16,917
Okay?

1768
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,292
I will give you my entire property,
leave alone 1 lakh.

1769
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:23,000
Just meet me once. Please, Naari.

1770
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:26,167
I told you.
I am not Naari. I am a hunter.

1771
01:40:26,375 --> 01:40:29,375
I have become your prey.
Try to understand.

1772
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:31,167
Baby doll.
- Look.

1773
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,458
Don't you want to
know where your bag is?

1774
01:40:33,542 --> 01:40:34,667
I will still tell you.

1775
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,458
Your bag is in the lounge.

1776
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:38,625
I am sending you the account number.
Okay? Bye.

1777
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,667
Open. Open. Open.

1778
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:55,208
See this.

1779
01:40:55,292 --> 01:40:56,875
Where did she go?

1780
01:41:01,917 --> 01:41:02,958
Naari.

1781
01:41:04,083 --> 01:41:06,083
I mean bloody Naari.
- Scoundrel.

1782
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:08,042
Listen. Drive faster.

1783
01:41:08,375 --> 01:41:10,542
It's a car. Not a rocket.

1784
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:14,125
Just try to press the accelerator.
It will automatically become a rocket.

1785
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:17,375
Oh no! What happened?

1786
01:41:17,458 --> 01:41:20,708
Stop quickly.
We have reached.

1787
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:22,792
What happened?
- What happened?

1788
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,708
Oh no!

1789
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:36,375
How much time will it take?

1790
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:37,542
I am getting late.

1791
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:41,333
That scoundrel was in a
hurry who left a nail on the road.

1792
01:41:42,375 --> 01:41:44,625
They think the road
is their father's park.

1793
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:47,500
What you don't want
at home dump it on the road.

1794
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:50,667
Will you just blabber
or will you do something too?

1795
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:51,958
Work fast.

1796
01:41:52,042 --> 01:41:54,000
Yes. I am not changing clothes here.

1797
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,583
I have to change the tire.
It takes time.

1798
01:41:57,083 --> 01:41:59,250
I am getting late.
I have to go home. Please.

1799
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:01,958
And she didn't go to
Dev's house for the passport.

1800
01:42:02,042 --> 01:42:03,458
She went there to hide the money.

1801
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:07,750
The money is there.
Undergarments are here.

1802
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:11,333
In the bag. A similar bag.

1803
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:12,667
I didn't do anything.

1804
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,750
After duping you she must have gone..

1805
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:16,417
..to his house to collect the money.

1806
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,833
Right?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

1807
01:42:20,042 --> 01:42:21,917
Dump him in the car.

1808
01:42:22,417 --> 01:42:23,125
Yes, brother.

1809
01:42:23,208 --> 01:42:25,792
My car's luck is bad today.

1810
01:42:26,417 --> 01:42:28,500
I had to change the
brake in the morning.

1811
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,958
The radiator got
damaged in the evening.

1812
01:42:31,042 --> 01:42:32,708
And the tire got punctured at night.

1813
01:42:32,917 --> 01:42:34,750
Wonder whose face I
saw when I woke up today.

1814
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:37,042
Look. Will you just blabber
or will you do something too?

1815
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:39,833
If you are getting so late,
go walking.

1816
01:42:39,917 --> 01:42:40,875
Fine.

1817
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:43,625
Spoilt my mood.
To hell with you.

1818
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:45,458
I am leaving.
- She is actually leaving.

1819
01:42:45,542 --> 01:42:48,375
Ma'am, pay my fare.

1820
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:49,667
Yes. Why not?

1821
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,042
You won't get a single penny.

1822
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:53,000
I am getting late because of you.

1823
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:54,458
Handle your decrepit car.
I am going.

1824
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:55,458
Ma'am.
- Get lost!

1825
01:42:55,542 --> 01:42:57,333
Such an insolent girl.

1826
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:01,375
You mean she just left you.

1827
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:04,417
Damn! Damn!

1828
01:43:05,542 --> 01:43:09,917
In fact, I bought the house
too for her. Using all my savings.

1829
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:13,292
That is so romantic.

1830
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:29,125
Get in! Get in!

1831
01:43:29,208 --> 01:43:31,042
I will get hurt.

1832
01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:42,958
Every house says something.

1833
01:43:47,792 --> 01:43:51,375
Listen. Mr. Jazzy,
Naari's room is upstairs.

1834
01:43:56,583 --> 01:43:59,458
Can I go?
Please. You don't need me now.

1835
01:43:59,542 --> 01:44:01,542
I am useless.
I am saying it for so long.

1836
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:03,333
Shall I go? My work is over.

1837
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:04,208
I am free?

1838
01:44:04,292 --> 01:44:06,792
He has lousy hair. Cut it off.

1839
01:44:06,875 --> 01:44:07,833
Yes, brother.

1840
01:44:07,917 --> 01:44:09,583
Why are you cutting my hair?

1841
01:44:09,667 --> 01:44:11,417
I said I will leave.
- Where are you going?

1842
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,875
Come on.
- No.

1843
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:15,792
Come on.
- Mr. Jazzy. Mr. Jazzy, why me?

1844
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:19,250
Come on.
- Why are you punishing me for the photo?

1845
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:27,500
This is my garden.
- You like gardening too?

1846
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:39,667
Are you okay?
- It's a daily thing.

1847
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:41,250
Sorry.

1848
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:49,417
The room is upstairs.
Go and freshen up. I will show you.

1849
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,708
Carefully.
- Yes.

1850
01:44:57,167 --> 01:44:58,750
Whose luggage is this?

1851
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:01,333
Naari's.

1852
01:45:01,708 --> 01:45:03,083
See if something fits you.

1853
01:45:03,167 --> 01:45:06,000
She had messaged that she
will send someone to collect it.

1854
01:45:07,833 --> 01:45:09,875
Do you know?
She is marrying somebody else.

1855
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:12,125
I am such a fool. Right?

1856
01:45:13,208 --> 01:45:15,125
In fact, you are very cute.

1857
01:45:15,208 --> 01:45:16,500
I will make coffee.

1858
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,333
Money.

1859
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:37,792
I am still changing.
- Yes. Take your time.

1860
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:40,792
I just wanted to ask how
much sugar you take in your coffee.

1861
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:41,875
Two.

1862
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:49,625
'But how will I arrange
for 2 lakhs so soon?'

1863
01:45:57,375 --> 01:45:58,708
Hi, Dev.

1864
01:45:58,792 --> 01:46:02,542
Oh my God!
You have lost so much weight.

1865
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:11,417
Listen, Naari.
I am a little busy.

1866
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:14,042
Busy? Is that so?

1867
01:46:14,125 --> 01:46:16,167
I don't feel you are busy.

1868
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:24,333
Stop this drama. Just two minutes.

1869
01:46:24,417 --> 01:46:25,792
You...what?

1870
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:30,250
Oh! So this is the matter.

1871
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:32,083
That's why you were stopping me.
- Palak, don't listen to her.

1872
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:33,500
It's fine. Okay? She..

1873
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:34,708
Is she your girlfriend?

1874
01:46:43,083 --> 01:46:44,875
You had broken it long back.

1875
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:46,500
Today I am breaking it.

1876
01:46:46,583 --> 01:46:47,750
Take whatever things you want.

1877
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:49,250
Tomorrow I will dump the rest.

1878
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:50,375
Goodbye.

1879
01:46:56,958 --> 01:46:58,167
Oh no! Wallet!

1880
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:16,875
Palak.

1881
01:47:18,958 --> 01:47:19,833
Palak.

1882
01:47:40,833 --> 01:47:42,333
Dev took my..

1883
01:47:42,417 --> 01:47:43,792
No. No. No.

1884
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:45,958
Relax. Relax.

1885
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:47,333
It must be here.

1886
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:51,167
It must be here.
Where else will it go?

1887
01:48:00,458 --> 01:48:02,667
You don't have money, do you?

1888
01:48:03,042 --> 01:48:05,042
How will you pay the cab's fare?

1889
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:16,292
Jazzy, you?

1890
01:48:17,042 --> 01:48:18,833
I will explain everything to you.

1891
01:48:18,917 --> 01:48:20,833
It wasn't my idea.

1892
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:24,208
It's Dev's idea.

1893
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:25,250
I swear.

1894
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:28,083
I didn't know he is
interested in your money.

1895
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:32,167
He clicked my dirty picture.

1896
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:33,917
And he blackmailed me.

1897
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,292
I do whatever he says.
I am a very simple girl.

1898
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:39,250
I am speaking the truth.
Dev has done all this.

1899
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:41,417
Go and catch him.
- Naari.

1900
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,750
I will work day and night.

1901
01:48:43,833 --> 01:48:44,750
God promise.

1902
01:48:44,833 --> 01:48:47,167
I will repay your each penny.

1903
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:48,833
In fact, if you don't believe me..

1904
01:48:48,917 --> 01:48:51,042
..I will sign postdated cheques.

1905
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:53,417
Installment. I mean..

1906
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:57,083
I won't be able to repay
such a hefty amount together. So..

1907
01:48:57,667 --> 01:48:59,542
By the way, how much money was it?

1908
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:02,042
I have not come here for the money.

1909
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:05,417
Oh my God!
You have come to kill me, haven't you?

1910
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:06,667
Please spare me.

1911
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,833
What will you gain by killing me?

1912
01:49:08,917 --> 01:49:10,750
Please forgive me.

1913
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,375
I don't have anybody
in the world. I swear.

1914
01:49:13,458 --> 01:49:15,750
If I also die, what will be left?

1915
01:49:15,875 --> 01:49:18,167
Please spare me. Forgive me, Jazzy.
- Okay.

1916
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:21,250
Jazzy, please.
- Fine. But on one condition.

1917
01:49:21,333 --> 01:49:24,042
I accept everything.
Whatever you say.

1918
01:49:24,292 --> 01:49:26,917
Come home.
- What?

1919
01:49:27,583 --> 01:49:31,292
I can't live without you.
I have left everything.

1920
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,750
I have quit all illegal activities.

1921
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:35,500
For you.

1922
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:38,083
And I was going to
tell you the other day.

1923
01:49:38,292 --> 01:49:40,125
You left me.

1924
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:46,333
So you...have not come to kill me?

1925
01:49:46,417 --> 01:49:50,500
Silly girl.
Does somebody kill his own life?

1926
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:52,542
Silly girl.

1927
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:57,083
And...the money?

1928
01:49:57,458 --> 01:50:00,458
I have enough money. Don't worry.

1929
01:50:01,708 --> 01:50:03,208
Just come with me.

1930
01:50:04,167 --> 01:50:07,000
I love you a lot.

1931
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:10,000
I want only you.

1932
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,792
I also love only you, Jazzy.
I swear.

1933
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:18,333
Dev brainwashed me.

1934
01:50:18,417 --> 01:50:21,375
Otherwise I would have
never done this to you. I..

1935
01:50:21,792 --> 01:50:26,375
Naari, stop it. How much will you lie?

1936
01:50:26,833 --> 01:50:30,042
Everybody says you are a thug.

1937
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,917
And I also knew this long back.

1938
01:50:35,417 --> 01:50:37,833
But I am also not an engineer.

1939
01:50:39,792 --> 01:50:41,708
I am also a goon.

1940
01:50:45,167 --> 01:50:47,458
You are a goon. I am a thug.

1941
01:50:47,542 --> 01:50:49,167
No. No.

1942
01:50:50,292 --> 01:50:54,875
You are a goon. I am a thug.

1943
01:50:55,625 --> 01:50:57,292
Silly girl.

1944
01:50:57,667 --> 01:51:01,667
Look, my moustache has also
become sad after you left me.

1945
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:06,042
I am sorry.
- Thank you.

1946
01:51:07,042 --> 01:51:09,458
Come home. Fine?

1947
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:13,375
I have quit everything.
You also quit everything.

1948
01:51:13,625 --> 01:51:15,542
And lead a decent life with me.

1949
01:51:15,917 --> 01:51:19,917
I love you.
- I am sorry.

1950
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,708
I thought you will kill me.

1951
01:51:22,792 --> 01:51:24,167
That's why I ran away.

1952
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:26,750
Otherwise I would have
never done that to you.

1953
01:51:26,833 --> 01:51:28,833
I am sorry.
- No problem.

1954
01:51:28,917 --> 01:51:31,292
I shouldn't have done that to you.
- Okay.

1955
01:51:31,375 --> 01:51:33,167
Okay. My coat is getting spoilt.

1956
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:35,500
Please forgive me.
- Don't cry so much.

1957
01:51:36,375 --> 01:51:38,250
It's okay. It's okay.

1958
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:40,250
Bad things happen.
Bad things happen.

1959
01:51:43,292 --> 01:51:44,375
Palak.

1960
01:51:48,667 --> 01:51:50,125
Please call me.

1961
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:20,958
Ma'am.

1962
01:52:22,792 --> 01:52:24,167
Call the boy.

1963
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:26,292
He isn't a bad guy.

1964
01:52:33,917 --> 01:52:36,750
Shall I ask you something?
- Ask away, baby.

1965
01:52:37,042 --> 01:52:39,125
Did you get your money?

1966
01:52:42,333 --> 01:52:44,292
Will anybody find out?

1967
01:52:44,292 --> 01:52:46,833
Sir, shall I tell you something?

1968
01:52:47,167 --> 01:52:50,500
In this world people
only see the outside glitter.

1969
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:54,917
Nobody has the eyes to
see the fake thing inside.

1970
01:52:56,667 --> 01:52:59,708
Mr. Kundan, the learned sage.

1971
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,917
Stop your sermon. And get to work.

1972
01:53:03,292 --> 01:53:05,958
Nonsense. Your sister-in-law
is waiting downstairs.

1973
01:53:06,333 --> 01:53:09,167
Nobody can steal my money.

1974
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:11,792
I don't let anybody do that.

1975
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:35,667
Pinku.
- Dev.

1976
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:36,917
Hey!
- Forgive me.

1977
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,750
What happened
to you all of a sudden?

1978
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:41,083
Naked.

1979
01:53:42,125 --> 01:53:43,833
What happened?
- Don't ask.

1980
01:53:43,917 --> 01:53:46,083
They thrashed me very badly.
Very badly.

1981
01:53:46,167 --> 01:53:48,417
Who beat you?
- Jazzy and his goons.

1982
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,958
Jazzy? Oh God!
- They thrashed me very badly.

1983
01:53:50,042 --> 01:53:51,000
Show me.

1984
01:53:51,083 --> 01:53:54,042
What are you doing?
- Liar. I can't see any wounds.

1985
01:53:54,125 --> 01:53:57,417
These are inner wounds.
It's hurting a lot, man.

1986
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:00,083
Okay. You..

1987
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:02,208
Do one thing. Sit down.
- No. No. No.

1988
01:54:02,292 --> 01:54:03,083
I won't sit down.

1989
01:54:03,167 --> 01:54:04,000
Lie down on your stomach.

1990
01:54:04,083 --> 01:54:06,000
No. I won't lie down
on my stomach at all.

1991
01:54:06,083 --> 01:54:07,625
I will keep standing like that.

1992
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:09,208
Come on.

1993
01:54:10,167 --> 01:54:11,333
Take a painkiller.

1994
01:54:15,292 --> 01:54:16,500
Tragic lover.

1995
01:54:17,292 --> 01:54:18,125
Wait and watch.

1996
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:20,542
You will wait for her call,
message and missed call.

1997
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:21,583
But nothing will happen.

1998
01:54:21,667 --> 01:54:23,458
Aren't you content
after being deceived once?

1999
01:54:24,167 --> 01:54:26,167
You are doing the same thing again.
Look, listen to me.

2000
01:54:26,375 --> 01:54:28,917
No more females in life.
Adopt this policy.

2001
01:54:30,792 --> 01:54:32,292
Look. The word lady
begins with the alphabet L.

2002
01:54:32,375 --> 01:54:34,417
What does L stands for? Loss.

2003
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,542
Loss of time. Loss of energy.

2004
01:54:36,625 --> 01:54:37,958
Loss of everything.

2005
01:54:38,042 --> 01:54:42,250
Girls don't lose anything.
But we lose everything.

2006
01:54:42,333 --> 01:54:44,292
So listen to me. Forget all this.

2007
01:54:44,542 --> 01:54:45,708
Are you listening to what I am saying?

2008
01:54:45,792 --> 01:54:48,000
You have become a lover boy.
Why don't you understand?

2009
01:54:48,083 --> 01:54:49,250
We lose everything.

2010
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:51,417
Do you understand?

2011
01:54:52,417 --> 01:54:53,750
What are you doing?

2012
01:54:53,833 --> 01:54:56,500
I am building my muscles.

2013
01:54:56,708 --> 01:54:57,708
I will build a body like Hulk.

2014
01:54:57,792 --> 01:54:59,000
I got beaten because of you.

2015
01:54:59,083 --> 01:55:00,500
Now I will thrash everyone.
Wait and watch.

2016
01:55:00,583 --> 01:55:03,458
Shall I say something?
Stop watching detective serials.

2017
01:55:03,792 --> 01:55:05,417
And join your papa's business.
You will be happy.

2018
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:06,542
Shut up.

2019
01:55:06,625 --> 01:55:08,375
Join your papa's business.
I am hungry.

2020
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:10,542
Make breakfast.
Make omelet for me.

2021
01:55:33,708 --> 01:55:34,583
Palak.

2022
01:55:39,667 --> 01:55:42,583
You have come early in the morning.

2023
01:55:48,417 --> 01:55:50,750
So many things happened that day.

2024
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,125
Like my car met with an accident.

2025
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:55,667
I went to the bank
and there was a robbery.

2026
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:58,333
Naari came back and left again.

2027
01:55:58,417 --> 01:55:59,333
Thank God.

2028
01:55:59,542 --> 01:56:01,917
And this poor girl's
wallet got stolen.

2029
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:03,750
What else happened?

2030
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:05,708
Fake money.

2031
01:56:06,792 --> 01:56:09,000
Why are you embarrassing
me by saying this?

2032
01:56:10,583 --> 01:56:11,833
I am not doing that.

2033
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:13,708
I am merely narrating
the incidences that happened.

2034
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:16,667
So if the robbery had not happened..

2035
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:18,458
..perhaps we would have never met.

2036
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:26,292
Actually, Dev thinks we met
for the first time in the bank.

2037
01:56:26,917 --> 01:56:30,292
But the truth is that..

2038
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,583
Palak, we might not
be able to meet again.

2039
01:56:39,875 --> 01:56:41,750
I am leaving for the US.

2040
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:43,625
And our marriage?

2041
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,500
It's not possible now.

2042
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,125
He left me.

2043
01:57:12,375 --> 01:57:14,583
But I was unable
to get up from my place.

2044
01:57:15,292 --> 01:57:17,083
It's like my legs had got frozen.

2045
01:57:17,417 --> 01:57:19,917
There were only suicidal
thoughts in my mind.

2046
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,500
I don't know when the
day turned into night.

2047
01:57:22,583 --> 01:57:25,125
I was unable to decide what to do.

2048
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:28,708
I had no reason to live
and I was afraid to die.

2049
01:57:29,625 --> 01:57:31,167
Then that moment arrived.

2050
01:57:31,583 --> 01:57:35,125
Coffee on the house.
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

2051
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,292
At that moment Dev
didn't give me coffee.

2052
01:57:41,375 --> 01:57:43,958
But he gave me a new hope to live.

2053
01:57:44,042 --> 01:57:46,042
I used to always
gaze at him secretly..

2054
01:57:46,125 --> 01:57:48,667
..while passing from the café.

2055
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:51,125
He had stolen my heart long back.

2056
01:57:51,417 --> 01:57:53,792
I would always wonder
what I would say..

2057
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:56,083
..the day he comes before
me for the first time.

2058
01:57:56,167 --> 01:57:59,958
But that day he came
and left like a gust of air.

2059
01:58:00,292 --> 01:58:02,208
And I didn't even realize it.

2060
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:13,292
The next time I saw Dev,
he was wiping his tears.

2061
01:58:16,333 --> 01:58:19,250
Look. His girlfriend left him.

2062
01:58:19,458 --> 01:58:21,417
Whose girlfriend left whom?

2063
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,042
Turn around.

2064
01:58:26,417 --> 01:58:27,833
Poor guy.

2065
01:58:34,417 --> 01:58:36,042
I know..

2066
01:58:37,542 --> 01:58:40,042
Bribe of 2 lakhs for a bank job.

2067
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,417
Meera, I need the job desperately.

2068
01:58:43,708 --> 01:58:44,792
Now what?

2069
01:58:46,917 --> 01:58:49,583
I will take a loan from a private
bank for a government bank job.

2070
01:58:49,667 --> 01:58:50,917
Will you get it?

2071
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:54,000
I will try.

2072
01:58:54,167 --> 01:58:55,833
You will get it. Don't worry.

2073
01:58:55,917 --> 01:58:58,667
When I went to sector 17's HFDC bank..

2074
01:58:58,792 --> 01:59:02,000
..for a personal loan of 2 lakhs..

2075
01:59:02,083 --> 01:59:04,583
Return my money.

2076
01:59:11,375 --> 01:59:12,792
It was a dream.

2077
01:59:14,583 --> 01:59:16,833
Oh God! Oh God!

2078
01:59:17,125 --> 01:59:18,875
I stole from Dev's house.

2079
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:23,292
Oh God! I love him so much.

2080
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:25,875
And he also loves me.

2081
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:29,542
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!
Please help me. Please help me.

2082
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:54,500
Palak.

2083
02:00:01,375 --> 02:00:03,500
You are here so early morning?

2084
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,625
Do you know? I was thinking about you.

2085
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:09,583
It's okay. You should have called.

2086
02:00:09,667 --> 02:00:12,292
I would have come to pick you up.

2087
02:00:12,792 --> 02:00:15,917
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have done that.

2088
02:00:16,583 --> 02:00:18,458
I have come to return your money.

2089
02:00:18,625 --> 02:00:21,708
Are you serious? You have
come to return the cab's fare?

2090
02:00:21,958 --> 02:00:22,958
No.

2091
02:00:23,042 --> 02:00:24,583
Look, if you were missing me,
you can say it.

2092
02:00:24,667 --> 02:00:26,625
I won't mind. Honestly.

2093
02:00:27,458 --> 02:00:29,042
I..
- Coffee.

2094
02:00:29,708 --> 02:00:31,417
Shall we go inside?
I will make you your café mocha.

2095
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:33,208
Yes.
- Come.

2096
02:00:35,042 --> 02:00:38,458
Stop roaming around naked.
She has come.

2097
02:00:38,542 --> 02:00:39,750
Who has come?

2098
02:00:39,833 --> 02:00:41,958
Wear your clothes
and come out. Please.

2099
02:00:42,333 --> 02:00:43,750
I told you.
I am hungry. I will eat and go.

2100
02:00:43,833 --> 02:00:45,917
Your mama's eyes was after me.

2101
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:47,208
Hi.

2102
02:00:47,458 --> 02:00:50,833
Sorry, I was exercising.

2103
02:00:52,667 --> 02:00:54,958
I told Dev about my mistake.

2104
02:00:55,042 --> 02:00:59,167
But to our surprise,
those bundles of notes were fake.

2105
02:00:59,792 --> 02:01:03,542
Dev and I laughed really
long staring at those bundles.

2106
02:01:04,083 --> 02:01:07,333
Then...Dev made coffee for me.

2107
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:11,458
And the hot coffee
melted the ice between us.

2108
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:15,833
And in two months...my journey
from unknown to known..

2109
02:01:15,917 --> 02:01:18,542
..known to friend
and friend to girlfriend.

2110
02:01:19,042 --> 02:01:22,125
Next month I'll be his wife.

2111
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Naari has said yes to marry me.

2112
02:01:48,083 --> 02:01:49,500
And I am sitting here.

2113
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,500
I am waiting here,
but she's late again.

2114
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:55,292
I am thinking of becoming a poet.

2115
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:01,333
She isn't picking up.

2116
02:02:02,125 --> 02:02:03,833
Must be driving.

2117
02:02:04,042 --> 02:02:06,792
You shouldn't talk while driving.

2118
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,333
She's a good girl.

2119
02:02:10,458 --> 02:02:11,750
The phone's ringing.

2120
02:02:14,167 --> 02:02:15,958
What?

2121
02:02:19,958 --> 02:02:24,125
You see...Naari likes to travel.

2122
02:02:24,167 --> 02:02:26,958
Her hobby is to travel around.

2123
02:02:26,958 --> 02:02:29,042
She gets lost.

2124
02:02:29,125 --> 02:02:30,333
Hold on.

2125
02:02:30,417 --> 02:02:31,333
Stay here.

2126
02:02:31,417 --> 02:02:33,000
We'll continue with the interview.

2127
02:02:33,083 --> 02:02:33,625
Okay?

2128
02:02:33,708 --> 02:02:34,333
We'll be right back.

2129
02:02:34,417 --> 02:02:35,042
Come on.

2130
02:02:35,625 --> 02:02:37,000
Why didn't you tie her up?

2131
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:38,250
She ran away again.

2132
02:02:40,208 --> 02:02:50,125
"She'll look into your
eyes and drive you crazy."

2133
02:02:50,208 --> 02:03:04,083
"If you want to stay safe...
then do as I say."

2134
02:03:18,917 --> 02:03:21,417
"Oh my...Baby's attitude."

2135
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,958
"Always looking for smooth preys."

2136
02:03:24,042 --> 02:03:30,375
"With her mesmerizing eyes...
she can rob the entire country."

2137
02:03:30,458 --> 02:03:31,750
"Oh baby.."

2138
02:03:31,833 --> 02:03:35,708
"This doll's a fraud."

2139
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,917
"This doll's a fraud."

2140
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,042
"She's a fraud."

2141
02:03:42,125 --> 02:03:45,542
"This doll's a fraud."

2142
02:03:47,042 --> 02:03:49,625
"Oh the lovely faces."

2143
02:03:49,667 --> 02:03:52,042
"Why wouldn't anyone
fall for them?"

2144
02:03:52,125 --> 02:03:59,458
"They pretend love
and steal your heart."

2145
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,583
"This doll's a fraud."

2146
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:08,000
"This doll's a fraud."

2147
02:04:08,083 --> 02:04:10,125
"She's a fraud."

2148
02:04:10,208 --> 02:04:14,208
"This doll's a fraud."

2149
02:04:25,292 --> 02:04:30,250
"They always look beautiful,
and wear high heels."

2150
02:04:30,333 --> 02:04:35,458
"Slim body, makeup...and always
decked in branded clothes."

2151
02:04:35,542 --> 02:04:40,500
"They never give a
second look to small cars."

2152
02:04:40,583 --> 02:04:45,750
"But for the BMW owners
she's got that emotional drama."

2153
02:04:45,833 --> 02:04:49,583
"Her eyes are always on the pocket."

2154
02:04:49,667 --> 02:04:50,875
"Baby.."

2155
02:04:50,958 --> 02:04:55,333
"This doll's a fraud."

2156
02:04:56,167 --> 02:04:59,083
"This doll's a fraud."

2157
02:04:59,167 --> 02:05:01,125
"She's a fraud."

2158
02:05:01,208 --> 02:05:05,042
"This doll's a fraud."

2159
02:05:15,917 --> 02:05:18,083
"I always knew about it."
