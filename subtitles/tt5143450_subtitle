00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,600
NORTHERN MALAYSIA

2
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,800
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER

3
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,840
<span style="style.default_1">So, you think you're thugs?</span>

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
<span style="style.default_1">Well, we can be thugs too.</span>

5
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
<span style="style.default_1">Hail Lord Shakthi!</span>

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,080
<span style="style.default_1">- Hail Lord Shakthi!
- Hail Lord Shakthi!</span>

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,360
<span style="style.default_1">Hail Lord Shakthi!</span>

8
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,000
<span style="style.default_1">The name Egambaram even strikes fear
into the heart of an unborn child.</span>

9
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
<span style="style.default_1">Is that so?</span>

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,480
<span style="style.default_1">The name Alex Pandian
strikes fear into the hearts</span>

11
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,440
<span style="style.default_1">of an unborn child and its mother!</span>

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,160
<span style="style.default_1">- Alex!
- Call me DSP.</span>

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,200
<span style="style.default_1">DSP?</span>

14
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,240
<span style="style.default_1">They are in a truck
loaded with deadly weapons.</span>

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,560
<span style="style.default_1">A simple command from me
is enough for them to...</span>

16
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,200
Appoy!

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,440
Keep this card somewhere safe.

18
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
- Hot water is ready for you.
- Okay.

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
- We're almost out of sugar.
- Okay.

20
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,320
Hey, get over here.

21
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,680
- How many times have I told you?
- Dad!

22
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,280
- Why won't you listen to me?
- Dad!

23
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,400
- You never learn, do you?
- Dad!

24
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,240
- Will you do it again?
- No, Dad.

25
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,920
Sit.

26
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,760
Why did you get an F?

27
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,640
The teacher told us to write an essay
entitled, "I am a Pen."

28
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,320
So, I wrote about a pen that can fly.

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,880
A flying pen?

30
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,560
The pen flies in my story.

31
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
You idiot!

32
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,480
The teacher wanted us
to use our imagination.

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
Write an essay worthy of an A.

34
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,440
- Do it now.
- But the essay has already been graded.

35
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
There's no point in rewriting it now.

36
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,120
You dare talk back?

37
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,960
You'll do as I say! Go!

38
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Look at that hair.

39
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
It's like a bird's nest
that was messed up by monkeys!

40
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,560
<span style="style.default_1">- Good morning, sir!
- Good morning, sir!</span>

41
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,560
<span style="style.default_1">Good morning. Be seated.</span>

42
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
<span style="style.default_1">- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, sir!</span>

43
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,000
Every object has a pattern.

44
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,240
Those curtains over there
have patterns on them.

45
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,760
Even the saris and sarongs
that your mothers wear

46
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,560
have patterns on them.

47
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,640
You're going to dip vegetables in paint
and create art with patterns.

48
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,680
<span style="style.default_1">Is everything clear?</span>

49
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,080
That looks really good.

50
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,080
Please make me one.

51
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,440
I saw something on TV yesterday.

52
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,720
In Japan, they rear
a special breed of cattle

53
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,920
in a place called Kobe.

54
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
They have it drink beer for breakfast.

55
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,680
Even if it walks just a short distance,
they give it a leg massage

56
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,760
to make sure the meat stays tender.

57
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,600
What a life, right?

58
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,400
But you're okay with
being slaughtered after that?

59
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,200
Hell yes!

60
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,920
You drink beer first thing in the morning
and get massages on-demand.

61
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,560
What more could you ask for?

62
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,720
Pay the bill and let's get going.

63
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,600
Hey, the money is on the table.

64
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
Greetings, dude.

65
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,080
Suguna, who are you coming as?

66
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,080
How about you, Murali?

67
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Kumar?

68
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
And you, Shankar?

69
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,160
He thinks out of the box.

70
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,640
Michael Jackson is a fine idea,
but how will you do the costume?

71
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,679
Hey!

72
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Hey!

73
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,160
Hey!

74
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,960
You're calling me like that?

75
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,440
Like that?

76
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,320
- I have a name!
- Calm down.

77
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,320
- I'm sorry.
- Relax.

78
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
We're all friends here, aren't we?

79
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,640
Appoy, fetch me the matches
from that drawer.

80
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,840
Uncle, is this you?

81
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,280
Yes.

82
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Is this Dad?

83
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,200
Yes.

84
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,880
That was when your dad
acted in a play at the estate.

85
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Dad was actually smiling.

86
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,280
Uncle, why do you live in this place?

87
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Look at that, Appoy.

88
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
The sea.

89
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,120
There's a hill behind us.

90
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,600
Properties with such views
can cost millions.

91
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,560
While we can get it for free from nature,

92
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,320
many of us choose to live in debt instead.

93
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,680
All could you ever want
is around you, Appoy.

94
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,760
All you need to do is keep your eyes open.

95
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm Da Gou.

96
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,360
Your friend was really
pissed off today, right?

97
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,120
Let's drink!

98
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,640
Drink up!

99
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Look at my watch.

100
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,240
Can you guess how much it costs?

101
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,400
I don't know, 1,000 ringgit?

102
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,640
How about you?

103
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm sure it costs 3,000 ringgit.

104
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,840
3,000 ringgit?

105
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,200
It only cost me 50 ringgit.

106
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,400
Just because I own a fancy car...

107
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,640
Even if I wear a fake,

108
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,120
everyone thinks it's authentic.

109
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,320
You two ride bikes.

110
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,160
Even if you wore authentic watches,

111
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,560
no one would believe that they are.

112
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,240
That's just the way
of the world, my friend.

113
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Okay?

114
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
You want people to respect you,

115
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,240
but respect is earned, not given.

116
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,440
You didn't sleep last night, did you?

117
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,440
I had a headache.

118
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
<span style="style.default_1">News read by Gandhi Kasinathan.</span>

119

00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,200
<span style="style.default_1">He denied the claims of certain sectors</span>

131
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,200
Sir, didn't you like my painting?

132
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
I liked it a lot.

133
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,280
Then why did you give me a C, sir?

134
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,840
The objective was to make patterns
with the vegetables.

135
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,480
But aren't these patterns?

136
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,760
- What did you hear?
- A clink.

137
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,440
I told you to paint
the spoon and the glass.

138
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,680
But you've painted the sound instead.

139
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,400
You're a good artist, but...

140
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,240
You'll get what I mean someday.

141
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,000
You just want a good grade, don't you?

142
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,840
The Primary School Achievement Test
is next year.

143
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
There will be no more art classes.

144
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,840
You won't have time for them either.

145
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,080
Sir, I got less pay.

146
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,120
That can't be right. Count it properly.

147
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,360
I've already counted it, boss.
It's still short.

148
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,880
But you took an advance this month.

149
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,880
No, I didn't.

150
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Look here. It says, "Maniam."

151
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,480
That means you've taken an advance.

152
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,160
But I certainly did not.

153
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,160
All right.
Bring your account card tomorrow.

154
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,680
We'll sort this out.

155
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,680
128 RESTAURANT

156
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,640
Sir, is that your car out there?

157
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Why?

158
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,320
You haven't paid for it in 34 months.

159
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,720
We're here to repossess your car.

160
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
We're just trying to make a living.

161
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,520
Appoy, remember the account card
I gave you the other day?

162
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,560
Go get it.

163
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,680
Why are you still here?

164
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,560
- Go get my account card.
- Account card?

165
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,080
- The account card!
- It's upstairs!

166
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,080
Have you found it yet?

167
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,080
Choose between the two.

168
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,640
What's up with this guy?

169
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,280
He's bold enough to openly put
a gun on the car and walk away.

170
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,920
I think we should
forget about it and leave.

171
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,960
Dorai!

172
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,800
What the hell is taking you so long?

173
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,560
What's all this?

174
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,560
You're going to grow up
and monkey around, too?

175
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,960
- Are you?
- No, Dad!

176
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,760
Please don't, Dad!

177
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
Dad!

178
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,880
Please don't, Dad!

179
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,400
Dad!

180
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,440
Please don't, Dad!

181
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,040
What the hell was that? Have you gone mad?

182
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,800
<span style="style.default_1">Before we proceed with
the awarding ceremony,</span>

183
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,640
<span style="style.default_1">let's welcome the participants
of the fancy dress competition on stage.</span>

184
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,000
<span style="style.default_1">First, Murali as the poet Bharathiyar.</span>

185
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,560
<span style="style.default_1">Next, Suguna as the poet Avvaiyar.</span>

186
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,920
<span style="style.default_1">Kumar as the nation's founding father,
Tunku Abdul Rahman.</span>

187
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,120
<span style="style.default_1">Next, Martin as the philosopher
Thiruvalluvar.</span>

188
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,280
You're reckless, aren't you?

189
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,120
Open it up.

190
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,040
- My name is Gila.
- Dorai.

191
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,360
You're amazing.

192
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
- Takkali.
- Dorai.

193
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,920
- Takkali.
- I'm Potato.

194
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,200
Just kidding.

195
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,640
Please drink.

196
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,280
You've introduced yourselves, right?

197
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,240
Come. Let's drink.

198
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Cheers!

199
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,440
Da Gou, you and I have a problem.

200
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,760
You've sent these punks
to repossess my car

201
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,320
instead of dealing with me directly.

202
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,640
You've humiliated me.

203
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,440
Now, I have a bone to pick
with this Indian.

204
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,080
Get over here
if you've got a problem with me.

205
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,800
We'll settle this. One-on-one. Come on!

206
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,120
I don't believe in gang fights.

207
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,320
We'll settle this like gentlemen.

208
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,400
If you win, you tell your guys
to beat the shit out of me.

209
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,480
If I win, you get the fuck out of here!

210
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Come on, dickhead!

211
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,640
7 times 6 is 42. 8 times 6 is 48.

212
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,640
9 times 6 is 54. 10 times 6 is 60.

213
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,200
-11 times 6 is 66.
- Fine, sit down.

214
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Shankar.

215
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,920
Recite the 9th multiplication table.

216
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,960
1 times 9 is 9. 2 times 9 is 18.

217
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,360
3 times 9 is...

218
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,520
Haven't you memorized it yet?

219
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,480
I remembered it until yesterday, sir.
But I seem to have forgotten it today.

220
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
The multiplication table
will help you greatly,

221
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,880
not only in exams, but also in life.

222
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,560
Then what do we have calculators for, sir?

223
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

224
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,480
Calculators?

225
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,640
You want to use a calculator
instead of your brain.

226
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,160
You will memorize the tables
on your knees. Go!

227
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,520
Maniam, wait.

228
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,240
I made a mistake the other day.
Here's the rest of your salary.

229
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,440
- Please don't be mad.
- Okay.

230
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,840
- Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

231
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,320
So, he's given you
your remaining salary, Maniam?

232
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,680
It's my hard-earned money.
Where else would it go?

233
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,200
Aren't we going out to celebrate?

234
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,240
Aren't you drinking, Maniam?

235
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,600
I stopped drinking years ago.

236
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
When we lived in the rubber estates,
all we got was a movie once a month

237
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,400
and a stage play once a year.

238
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,000
If we danced to the tune of their whips,
we wouldn't go hungry.

239
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,160
In the towns these days,

240
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,920
beer has replaced toddy.

241
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
That means

242
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,160
we're still slaves,
but to a different master.

243
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,480
What's this, Maniam?
You're preaching while sober.

244
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,440
Our parents braved the jungles
and formed this country.

245
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,840
Now, all that's left of them
are their graves.

246
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,000
They sold the estates,
and left us high and dry.

247
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,320
We'll need money if we want
to break this cycle of slavery.

248
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,320
But we don't have money.

249
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,520
So, the only way forward
is through education.

250
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,880
My brothers never understood it.

251
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,480
If my son won't understand it either...

252
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,560
Come on. Let's drink.

253
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
What's that?

254
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Where have you been?

255
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,360
Get on the bike!

256
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,600
You're loitering, aren't you?

257
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
You're loitering
when you should be studying.

258
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,280
Mr. Ratnam has passed away.
His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

259
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,520
- What's up, guys?
- What is it, Ennaman?

260
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,880
Mr. Ratnam passed away.
His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

261
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,000
Go straight home.

262
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,680
Tell your mother I'll be late.

263
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,680
Mr. Ratnam passed away.
His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

264
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,080
The Primary School Achievement Test
is only four months away.

265
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,200
But, even now,

266
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,800
some of you still haven't memorized
the 12th multiplication table.

267
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Stand up!

268
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,240
Recite the 12th multiplication table.

269
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,080
1 times 12 is 12. 2 times 12 is 24.

270
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,080
3 times 12 is 36. 4 times 12 is 48.

271
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,280
5 times 12 is 60. 6 times 12 is 72.
8 times 12 is 84.

272
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
9 times 12 is 108. 10 times 12 is 120.

273
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,600
11 times 12 is 132.

274
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,440
12 times 12 is 144.

275
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,680
Half for Mom, half for Dad.

276
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,880
Stand up!

277
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,400
Share what you've written
with the rest of the class.

278
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,280
Read it out loud.

279
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,240
"Little egg.

280
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,040
I am the big egg.

281
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,720
Half for Mom, half for Dad.

282
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,400
6 times 6 is...

283
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,160
Here comes the teddy bear."

284
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,720
Keep this up,
and you'll get a zero on your tests.

285
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,480
Uncle, why do we have to go to school?

286
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,360
Can't we learn things from TV?

287
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,960
Why do we have to do things we don't like?

288
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,520
If you don't like it, don't do it.

289
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,080
Even memorizing the multiplication tables?

290
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Don't do it, then.

291
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,080
If I don't memorize them in two weeks,
Dad will be called to the school.

292
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Here.

293
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,920
That's a magic mirror.

294
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,240
It gauges if a person
is intelligent or dumb.

295
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,640
Memorize the tables
while looking into this mirror.

296
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,120
You will become intelligent

297
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,600
when you can no longer see
your mouth moving in this mirror.

298
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,520
1 times 12 is 12. 2 times 12 is 24.

299
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,400
3 times 12 is 36.

300
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,800
4 times 12 is 48. 5 times 12 is...

301
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Hey.

302
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,360
Do you always wear a leather jacket?

303
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,680
Come rain or shine?

304
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,280
I've always wanted to ask you this, man.

305
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,360
Did you shave your head to be stylish?

306
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
Or did you shave your head
because you're balding?

307
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,800
For style, right?

308
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,280
Hey, show some respect
when you speak to him.

309
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,360
He's insane.

310
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
- Insane?
- Yes.

311
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,480
What has he done that was so insane?

312
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,680
We were driving around
with our friends one night.

313
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,640
There was a police checkpoint up ahead.

314
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,440
This guy doesn't have a driver's license,
and he hasn't paid the road tax.

315
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,840
Well? What happened?

316
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,240
As the police were ready
to issue us a summons,

317
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,120
he grabbed the summons booklet,
jumped across a drain, and ran off.

318
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,240
Wow, you're spectacular!

319
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,040
Let's drink to you,
for making it across that drain.

320
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,600
Come on.

321
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,600
If Bala wasn't around back then,
I would be long dead.

322
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,800
I would've been cut by a machete.

323
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,040
He's just like you.

324
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,080
He's a man of action.
He doesn't waste time by thinking.

325
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,160
Am I right?

326
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,000
Act first.

327
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,840
Think later.

328
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,560
Enough of that, Da Gou.
That was a lifetime ago.

329
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's eat!

330
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,520
Aren't you going to ask them to join us?

331
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
That's all right.
They're having a good time drinking.

332
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,320
Let's eat.

333
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,360
<span style="style.default_1">Bala, I'm sorry...</span>

334
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,480
<span style="style.default_1">for never visiting when you were
in the rehabilitation center.</span>

335
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,400
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't want to see you like that.</span>

336
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,800
<span style="style.default_1">Do you still think about Maria?</span>

337
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,120
<span style="style.default_1">Don't punish yourself.</span>

338
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,480
<span style="style.default_1">She's gone.</span>

339
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
A drink?

340
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,240
Do you think it's wrong?

341
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,640
I joined the triad on a whim.

342
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
But now,

343
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,280
I play the game in earnest.

344
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,200
All know the way,
but few actually walk it.

345
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,240
<span style="style.default_1">This is emergency services,
how may I be of assistance?</span>

346
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,320
Do you think you're such a badass
because you want to join our gang?

347
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,159
Prove it. I dare you to throw
the beer in his face.

348
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,719
- You dare throw it in my face?
- I dare you!

349
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,960
- You dare throw it in my face?
- Throw it in his face!

350
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,280
- You dare throw it in my face?
- Throw it in his face if you dare!

351
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,480
- You dare throw it in my face?
- Fucking do it already!

352
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,440
Have all of you memorized
the multiplication tables?

353
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Shankar.

354
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,240
Let's hear it.

355
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,600
What? You don't know it by heart yet?

356
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,760
1 times 12 is 12. 2 times 12 is 24.
3 times 12 is 36.

357
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,440
4 times 12 is 48. 5 times 12 is 60.

358
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,960
6 times 12 is 72. 7 times 12 is 84.

359
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,200
8 times 12 is 96. 9 times 12 is 108.

360
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,200
10 times 12 is 120.

361
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,400
11 times 12 is 132. 12 times 12 is 144.

362
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,640
Sir, may I ask you a question?

363
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,960
Sir, what is 17 times 8?

364
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
It's 112.

365
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,360
What is 19 times 12?

366
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,040
It's 228.

367
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,080
Don't you know the multiplication tables?

368
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,680
Knowing the multiplication tables
up to 12 is enough.

369
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,280
We have calculators for anything past it.

370
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,840
Isn't that what I said the other day, sir?

371
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,480
I am your teacher.
You have to listen to me.

372
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,520
Then how come you get to beat us
when we get it wrong?

373
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,080
Mother, Father, Teacher?

374
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,280
- God!
- God!

375
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,320
Mother, Father, Teacher?

376
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
- God!
- God!

377
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,960
Mother, Father, Teacher?

378
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,320
- God!
- God!

379
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,920
NA TUK KONG ALTAR

380
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,680
Ennaman!

381
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,720
Mr. Ramu has passed away.
His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

382
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
The village head asked me to inform you.

383
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,240
<span style="style.default_1">Ma'am, Mr. Ramu has passed away.
His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.</span>

384
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Make sure you're there.

385
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,080
Sir, Mr. Ramu has passed away.
His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

386
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,840
<span style="style.default_1">No two brothers love each other</span>

387
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,520
<span style="style.default_1">As dearly as we do</span>

388
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,640
<span style="style.default_1">You are an extension of myself</span>

389
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,440
<span style="style.default_1">We were born of the same mother</span>

390
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,760
All right.

391
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,600
Rocho, this is my big brother.

392
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,880
Fine. Why don't you go there?

393
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,400
So, it's like that?

394
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Dorai.

395
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,960
I love you, Dorai.

396
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,320
All right. Now go over there.

397
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,040
Go now.

398
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,920
They call me Vadi.

399
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,560
I know exactly who you are, Vadivelan.

400
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,400
Dorai.

401
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,800
Hey, call him Mexico.

402
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,880
Mexico.

403
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,280
- Dorai.
- Rocho, sit down.

404
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,440
So, I hear you're a hunter too.
Or so my boys tell me.

405
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,280
How can a small fry like you
ever hope to play in the big leagues?

406
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Don't you get it?

407
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,800
Drugs.

408
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,480
Drugs are the future.

409
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,880
I'm not in the business of selling drugs.

410
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,560
I'm in the business
of turning people into pieces.

411
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,720
That's nice.

412
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,000
Don't ever come here again, Vadivelan.

413
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,240
Sir, how are you?

414
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,000
Yes, just the same. Alive and kicking.

415
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,920
It was said they buried him alive.

416
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,520
This was Appoy's doing.

417
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,920
He gave Appoy some homework.

418
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,480
Isn't it common to beat a child
who hasn't done his homework?

419
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,040
Would you announce a man's death for that?

420
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,280
He's just a young boy anyway.
Please don't punish him too harshly.

421
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,880
I don't know what Appoy has against me.

422
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,760
He said that I told him
to announce Mr. Ramu's death.

423
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,040
I'm not too bothered by this mess.

424
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,680
But Mr. Ramu is quite distraught.

425
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,720
We may be in the 21st century,

426
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,520
but aren't teachers
supposed to be respected like gods?

427
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,080
Appoy!

428
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Appoy!

429
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,560
Appoy!

430
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,640
- Kumar, we don't have school next week.
- How come?

431
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,840
Prayers for Mr. Ramu!

432
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,400
Here's to Mr. Ramu's death!

433
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,840
But I don't smoke.

434
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Appoy!

435
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,440
I just held the cigarette, Dad.

436
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,360
I didn't smoke it.

437
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,800
I didn't do it, Dad.

438
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,000
I held it, but I didn't smoke it.

439
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,920
I really didn't.

440
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,000
I didn't, Dad.

441
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,440
I held it, but I didn't smoke it.

442
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Show some pity.

443
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,240
If anyone dares to untie him...

444
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,520
Eat up.

445
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Your dad once accused me
of skipping school.

446
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,280
So, he tied me to a tree.

447
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,400
There was an ant hill nearby.
He got a part of it and threw it at me.

448
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,120
I was bitten all over.

449
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,720
You know how your dad is like, don't you?

450
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,840
But I didn't do anything wrong, Uncle.

451
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,360
Hey, fatty. Looks like someone got
a proper beating yesterday.

452
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,080
Are you staring at me?

453
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,440
Hey, are you staring at me?

454
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,120
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Don't you dare ignore me.

455
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,680
Leave my head alone!

456
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,560
Hey!

457
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,000
<span style="style.default_1">You're notorious now.</span>

458
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,640
Be careful.

459
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,800
Otherwise, no one will help you.

460
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,600
Why don't you hit him now? Go ahead.

461
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
What's going on?

462
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,920
Settling a dispute between these kids.

463
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,240
These kids had an argument,
so I came here to settle it.

464
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,480
What's up, Appoy?

465
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,520
You know who he is, don't you?

466
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,480
He's Mexico's nephew.

467
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,400
Get lost.

468
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,520
Let's go, Panther.

469
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,320
- Hey.
- Go.

470
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,200
Two orders of iced chocolate malt.

471
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,840
Check out the informant over there.

472
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,800
Tell that Bangladeshi
in the green T-shirt to come here.

473
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,520
If he refuses, tell him I'll come to him.

474
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,160
You, Bangla!

475
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,200
Get over here.

476
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,600
What is it?

477
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,760
Not you.
I was talking to the guy in green.

478
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,000
What is it, little brother?

479
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,440
"Little brother"? Am I your brother?

480
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,600
Get over here.

481
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,480
Why? What is this about?

482
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,640
If he doesn't come with me,
Chicago will come here instead.

483
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,800
Come here. Where were you running off to?

484
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,760
- Are you Shah Rukh Khan?
- No.

485
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,560
- Salman Khan?
- No.

486
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,520
My name is Mirzan.

487
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,840
- What did you say?
- Mirzan.

488
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,480
Brazen, isn't he?

489
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,880
Speak only when I ask you to.
Don't speak out of turn.

490
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,840
Are there plenty of girls in this town?

491
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,400
Answer me.

492
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,640
- What's going on here?
- Just a bit of fun.

493
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,400
- What are you doing here?
- Ask Chicago.

494
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,240
Appoy is awesome, Mexico.

495
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,400
You should have seen
how he intimidated this Bangla guy.

496
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,840
The guy was scared stiff.

497
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,800
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

498
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,760
Quit horsing around.

499
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,360
Do you know
what this Bangla guy has been doing?

500
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,840
He's been wooing our local girls.

501
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,560
Hey, get lost!

502
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,000
Go home.

503
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,400
So you're a big man now?

504
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,960
- What happened, dear?
- Ask him!

505
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,960
- You're a big man now?
- What?

506
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
Appoy!

507
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,000
How dare you raise your hand
against your dad?

508
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,520
Don't you ever do that again.

509
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,720
Go to your room!

510
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,880
Mexico shouldn't have chastised us
in front of those runts.

511
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,360
He treats Rocho better than us.

512
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,760
That slap wasn't meant for me.
It was meant for you.

513
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,680
Are you here to stir shit up
between me and Mexico?

514
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,600
Don't pull your tricks on me, you dog!

515
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,720
I'll break your face! Get lost!

516
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,720
Do you know why they say, "Cheers"?

517
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,520
The eyes see it.

518
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,240
The hand feels it.

519
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,680
The nose smells it.

520
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,320
The tongue tastes it.

521
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,600
But pity the ears
because they're left out.

522
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,120
And so they say...

523
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,680
Drink up.

524
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm reminded of my dad
every time I look at you.

525
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,320
He was pretty much like you, a loyal thug.

526
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,120
All that will last
for as long as you're young.

527
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,680
They say education is the key.

528
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,880
But the educated answer to those in power.

529
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,080
There is no room
for intelligence in this world.

530
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,560
Only power.

531
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,560
Now, if you were in power,
the educated would answer to you.

532
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,320
She's an unblemished rose.
Handle her with care.

533
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,160
Sir, it's done.

534
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,720
Want to try it, sir?

535
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,520
Mom?

536
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,720
Mom?

537
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,520
Mom?

538
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,160
Boss, heroin is in high demand.

539
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,880
- <span style="style.default_1">Send more next time.</span>
- All right.

540
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,880
Boss, we're low on stock. What do we do?

541
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,480
Grind this up

542
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,360
and mix it in.

543
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,200
I've heard the news, Mexico.

544
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,520
You started out as a thug,
and now you've moved to drugs.

545
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,880
Drugs? Me?

546
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,120
You know I despise those things, sir.

547
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,400
Don't bother denying it.

548
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,320
Just make sure you don't get caught.

549
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,440
<span style="style.default_1">Uncle?</span>

550
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,800
Come in, Appoy.

551
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,000
- I'll come back another day.
- Appoy!

552
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
Come. Sit here.

553
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,720
Once upon a time, you had an uncle.

554
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,360
He was very fit.

555
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
Then,

556
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,520
he got hooked on this drug
and eventually became your late uncle.

557
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,000
You must never forget that.

558
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,720
You must never ever touch this stuff.

559
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:52,440
Each man leads his life
according to his own sense of justice.

560
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,240
But above all that,

561
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,160
there is a higher truth.

562
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,600
In the presence of that higher truth,

563
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,680
when we stand before it,

564
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,960
we are all...

565
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,160
hollow.

566
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,360
In its presence,

567
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,440
when we stand before that higher truth,

568
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,000
we are all hollow.

569
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
Maniam!

570
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
Maniam!

571
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,080
Your brother, Bala, was found dead.

572
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,160
Vadivelan!

573
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,360
You've done it this time.

574
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,280
- Talk to me!
- You're dead meat!

575
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,000
You have to deal with me first.

576
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,160
I'm the one you're looking for.

577
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,360
You're dead now.

578
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,200
No. You're dead.

579
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,200
<span style="style.default_1">Emergency services.</span>

580
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,320
<span style="style.default_1">Sir?</span>

581
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,440
<span style="style.default_1">Sir?</span>

582
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,200
This was all Chicago's doing.

583
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,720
Mexico knew nothing about it.

584
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,560
Thank you.

585
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,160
If that guy dies,

586
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,960
Mexico may be imprisoned.

587
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,080
But don't worry.

588
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,760
If Mexico is imprisoned,

589
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,480
I'll give you 1,000 ringgit every month.

590
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,920
There's no need for that.
Thanks anyway, sir.

591
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,760
He's one of my boys, after all.

592
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,520
I have to look out for him.

593
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,040
He's my brother.

594
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,840
Yes?

595
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,000
All right.

596
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,040
It's a good thing that guy didn't die.

597
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,680
PENGKALAN HULU MAGISTRATES COURT

598
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,160
- Appoy's uncle is a pussy!
- How come?

599
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:43,320
He cried like a baby
at the police station.

600
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,280
That's exactly how he cried.

601
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,840
- My uncle didn't cry.
- Yes, he did. He's a pussy!

602
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,960
Close your eyes, Dorai.

603
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,080
Leave your troubles in the past.

604
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,600
Eat well, Dorai.

605
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,240
Eat.

606
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,680
- Mom, is Uncle back home?
- He's in the room.

607
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,120
Have you eaten, Appoy?

608
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,760
I've made up my mind, Da Gou.

609
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,640
Shall we execute Chicago?

610
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,359
I want to quit the gang.

611
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,319
I still want out.

612
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,120
Look at these brothers of yours.

613
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:37,520
Who will look after your brothers
if you quit?

614
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,840
Regardless of who wants to leave,
the rules still apply.

615
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,359
We have mixed our blood.

616
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,760
So that blood has to be returned.

617
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,439
Do you understand?

618
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,120
Gila, you're always with him, aren't you?

619
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,680
Hit him.

620
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,920
Stop, boy.

621
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,080
I said stop, didn't I?

622
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:26,680
Why are you squaring your shoulders?
Don't do that.

623
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,960
Don't square your shoulders, boy.

624
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,000
Rocho!

625
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,840
That's enough!
