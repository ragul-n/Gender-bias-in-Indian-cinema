1
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,875
Move..

2
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,155
Move!

3
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,436
Stop!

4
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:07,833
'That's Mr. Sharma.'

5
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:08,593
This wedding cannot take place.

6
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,907
'He too is one of
the fathers in Delhi..'

7
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:15,255
'..whose daughter's
heart beat for Veer.'

8
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:20,578
'Like others, Mr. Sharma too is eagerly
waiting for Veer to get married.'

9
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,421
'So that,
he too can find some peace of mind.'

10
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:24,008
What happened?

11
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,148
Channi eloped with Veerey.

12
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,570
Damn!

13
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,661
You are in your bed..

14
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,318
And not at a wedding hall.

15
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,896
Channi is making parathas
in the kitchen.

16
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:33,897
Really?

17
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,085
Tell me something?
Yeah?

18
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,727
Why are you so worried about Veerey?

19
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:39,693
Why do you keep cursing him?

20
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,318
He is such a nice boy.

21
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,945
He is a gem of a person, this Veer.

22
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:52,623
'Prabhu Arora.'

23
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:53,865
'A businessman.'

24
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:58,827
'He has more money
than he can count.'

25
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:04,724
'But he is such a miser that
even his money yearns to be spent.'

26
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,619
I have already added sugar.
You don't need to add more.

27
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:10,016
And I have made it so you
don't have to.. Listen..

28
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:13,359
You don't need to add sugar
when you make it, darling.

29
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Enough of romance.

30
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,004
Your blood sugar level is high.

31
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,920
Come on, let's eat breakfast.
Coming.

32
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:20,060
Tolaram..
Yes, ma'am?

33
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:21,435
Is the tea ready?
Yes.

34
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:22,254
Did you add sugar?

35
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:24,470
Yes.. No.
No, I didn't.

36
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,857
'He has just one problem, his son..'

37
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:27,804
'Veer.'

38
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,239
'He keeps giving away
millions as charity..'

39
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:34,768
'And keeps giving his
father shocks in small doses.'

40
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:38,521
Listen, Veerey shenanigans
tend to hurt in such a way..

41
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,545
...that you cannot
even complain about them.

42
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,848
What happened?

43
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:44,754
Tell me..

44
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:45,779
What did he do?

45
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:48,998
He spent 270,000 on two dentures.

46
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:52,293
270,000?
Yes.

47
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:53,506
On two dentures?
Yes.

48
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,575
Did he break someone jaw?

49
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:57,173
Tell me.

50
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,029
What are you doing?

51
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,214
I asked you something.

52
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:03,168
It's not so.

53
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:03,950
Then?

54
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,060
There's Trilok Nagar
behind the Hanuman, right?

55
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:07,116
Hmm.

56
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:08,763
There is a juice stall over
there, right?

57
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:09,423
Hmm.

58
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:13,294
That uncle with moustaches
and his short wife..

59
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,013
The one who speaks like a parrot.

60
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,767
She met Veerey one day.

61
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:17,734
She was missing a few teeth.

62
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,091
She told him:

63
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,459
"Son, I wish to eat walnuts."

64
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,849
So, your generous soon
took her to City Hospital.

65
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,756
Do you know what she told him?

66
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,474
"We want imported teeth."

67
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:31,306
So, he got her imported teeth.

68
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,318
135,000 for one.
270,000 for two.

69
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,183
He did a good deed.

70
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,566
Even if only for a few days, she
will at least food that she likes.

71
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:40,138
Right?

72
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,626
Darling, what will she eat?

73
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:44,828
She has got a new pair
of teeth worth 270,000.

74
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:46,013
Now she calls him every day..

75
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,894
"Send over some walnuts.
I wish to eat walnuts."

76
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:50,404
Now they want him to arrange
for walnuts as well. Amazing.

77
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:51,801
Listen..

78
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:53,326
Sorry, my phone.

79
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:57,190
If you come across any
of his shenanigans, do inform me..

80
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,473
I cannot digest food
until I hear about one.

81
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:03,203
No matter what you say,
my Veerey is the heart of Delhi.

82
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:06,216
'You guessed it right. That's
the guy we are talking about, Veer.'

83
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:07,943
'Problem?
What problem?'

84
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,460
'That's the problem..
He doesn't have any problem.'

85
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:13,443
'So, he keeps solve
problems of the world.'

86
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:14,896
'What?'

87
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,475
'You just saw his mobile phone.
Once you have a look at him..'

88
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:19,476
Veerey, I've got a tip.

89
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,817
A few are planning to
rob an ATM van. When?

90
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:22,714
11:30 am.

91
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,355
Four men.

92
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,131
They will pass through CP.

93
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:25,132
'Awesome.'

94
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,410
Step on it!

95
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:30,451
Okay.

96
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:31,213
Faster!

97
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:32,555
Do you want me to make it fly?

98
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,390
Drive faster!

99
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:38,778
Why don't you drive instead?

100
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:10,208
Oh no!

101
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,231
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

102
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:40,746
Get down quickly.

103
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:26,415
Hurry up. Someone will show up.

104
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:27,617
Take this too.

105
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,020
We need to take all the money.

106
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:31,061
Open the bag wide.
Yes. Take some more.

107
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:35,323
Give it here.

108
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,750
First, learn how to hold it.

109
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,751
Please forgive us.

110
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,613
Sorry. I am a mistake, sir.

111
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:43,848
Please forgive me, sir.

112
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,707
My sister is getting married.
I need 100,000, sir.

113
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,620
That's why I agreed
to come with them, sir.

114
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,181
Please save me, sir. Otherwise,
my family will get ruined.

115
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,097
Please, sir.

116
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,504
Please forgive me, sir.

117
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:55,223
I need 50,000, sir.

118
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,722
My mother is in the hospital, sir.

119
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,199
Please forgive me, sir.
I need 50,000.

120
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,121
I need to gift my
wife a gold necklace.

121
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:04,462
Your wife?

122
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,068
She refuses to give me food.

123
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,297
What's your wife's name?

124
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,019
Diya.

125
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,291
Huh?
Diya!

126
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,115
Diya!

127
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,708
Wants to gift a necklace!

128
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,692
Give me just some, sir.
Get lost!

129
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,476
Give me just some, sir. I am
hungry, sir.

130
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:16,324
Give me just some.
Get lost!

131
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,363
She won't give me any
food today either!

132
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,270
He ran away, leaving us alone.

133
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:24,952
First of all,
put all the money back.

134
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,817
If I catch you doing this again..

135
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:29,972
Then your bones will
be found in this trunk.

136
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:31,809
Got it?

137
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,810
Yes.

138
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:35,841
You can take 100,000 out of it.

139
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:37,981
And you too take 50,000.

140
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:38,964
How much did you need? 50,000?

141
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:39,683
50,000 right?

142
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:40,684
Take 50,000 and leave.

143
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,431
Never do such a thing again.

144
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,851
Got it?
Pick them up.

145
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Count it!

146
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:49,296
Count!

147
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,501
Count yours.

148
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:53,171
Four, five..

149
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:54,942
Jai Hind, sir!
Jai Hind.

150
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:57,761
Where's Veer?

151
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,642
Veer handed this
over to us and left.

152
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:01,446
Does it contain all the money?
No, sir.

153
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:02,848
150,000 are missing.

154
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,254
He made government
do a charity of 150,000.

155
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:09,805
Veerey, you will never change.

156
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:12,316
You first.
What about you?

157
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:14,441
Papa, please, we want ice cream.

158
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:15,586
Lajwanti..

159
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:18,190
Didn't I promise you that
I'd give you a tour of Delhi?

160
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:19,238
See, I fulfilled my promise.

161
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,230
Rubbish, what tour did you take me?

162
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,571
It's so hot in here.

163
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:25,292
And you didn't even
give me anything to eat.

164
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,932
Tell me, what would you like to eat?
I will get it right away.

165
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,921
I want to eat ice cream.

166
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,808
The big one.
Ice cream?

167
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,198
The big one?

168
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:34,575
Oh shit.

169
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,294
I don't have any money left.

170
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:01,797
Here, have some rocket ice cream.

171
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:03,084
I have others too.

172
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,390
Here's 4,000.
4,000!

173
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:06,152
Get me some more.
I'll get them.

174
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:06,896
Geet!

175
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,297
Mr. Veer Arora, you just wait there!

176
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:10,938
I'll teach you a lesson today.

177
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,436
What do you think of yourself?

178
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,999
Will I keep waiting
for you all my life?

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,751
Sorry, Geet.
Don't I have anything else to do?

180
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:18,693
I won't be late again.
You don't respect me at all.

181
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:19,534
Lord Almighty!

182
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:21,538
When will you learn
to come on time, Veer?

183
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,360
Papa, please. Papa, please.

184
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:25,201
I am not going to be your wife.

185
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:27,922
Otherwise, I'll spend
my whole life waiting for you.

186
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,936
What do you think of yourself?
You've had it from me today!

187
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,108
Lord Hanuman, please save my honor.

188
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:33,850
Here, eat this!

189
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,319
Got it!

190
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,161
Take this.

191
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,179
Didn't I tell you,
I am well respected over here?

192
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,276
Thank you, Lord Hanuman.

193
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:42,832
Yum!

194
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,020
You want to eat ice cream?

195
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,325
Here, have some more.

196
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,607
I'll teach you a lesson.

197
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,977
You idiot, donkey!

198
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:59,204
Veer Arora, you will never
stop being late, right?

199
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,732
I will have to keep
waiting for you all my life?

200
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,317
I have no intentions of being Mrs.
Veer Arora.

201
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:04,318
Got it?

202
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:27,752
"Keep me in your heart
and not your mind."

203
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,549
"Don't keep me on
the side or behind."

204
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:43,416
"Keep me in your heart
and not your mind."

205
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:47,150
"Don't keep me on
the side or behind."

206
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:49,181
"Listen up, girl.."

207
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,161
"Listen up, girl.."

208
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:52,985
"I have a huge fan following."

209
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:56,948
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

210
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:00,650
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

211
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,824
"He is quite mind-blowing."

212
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,338
"He is quite mind-blowing."

213
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,204
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

214
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:16,326
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

215
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:35,137
"You can follow me on twitter
or stock me on Facebook."

216
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:38,889
"I am very famous,
a have millions of fans."

217
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,904
"Let me click a selfie
together and upload it."

218
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,778
"You too will get
famous and renowned."

219
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,963
"I agree a little milky.."

220
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:52,489
"I agree a little
milky is your glowing."

221
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,169
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

222
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,790
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

223
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:19,205
"My love, you can
check the Whatsapp DP."

224
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:22,885
"You can ask your
friend or trust me."

225
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,893
"Keep your threatening
attitude away."

226
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:30,908
"Tag love a little,
and enjoy heavily bliss every day."

227
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:32,880
"Let the car.."

228
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:36,448
"Let the car go slowing."

229
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:40,315
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

230
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:44,143
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

231
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,791
"He is quite mind-blowing."

232
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:51,799
"He is quite mind-blowing."

233
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:55,518
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

234
00:14:55,846 --> 00:15:00,285
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

235
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:07,776
Arora, I am fed up with Ghuggi.

236
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,791
What happened?
What did he do now?

237
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:12,729
He rejected that girl as well.
Really?

238
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,822
He says she doesn't
have a good voice.

239
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,099
Arora..

240
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:24,186
He always does something as soon
as my blood pressure gets normal.

241
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:27,661
Brother,
your son only does something..

242
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,671
My son Veer always
does something drastic.

243
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:30,352
Really?

244
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,019
I went to Kolkata a few days back.

245
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:34,123
Only for three days.

246
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:36,405
Veer looked after the whole factory.

247
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,533
My right-hand man, Shambhu.

248
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:39,574
He is fifty years old.

249
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:43,161
He fell in love with a girl
who applies henna in a parlor.

250
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:44,593
You know what Veer did?
What?

251
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:45,930
He got them both married.

252
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,458
That's good.
How is it good?

253
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,178
They got married three months back.

254
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,738
He is still on honeymoon.

255
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:52,817
Oh.

256
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,412
Brother,
all my deliveries got delayed.

257
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:59,474
I have never said as many lies
as I have in these three months.

258
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,106
And all this is because of Veer.

259
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,076
And Veer is just a pupil.

260
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:03,719
Really?

261
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,478
You know my elder brother, Nikku?
Yes.

262
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,716
Nikku's son, Balli, he is his guru.

263
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:11,929
Okay.

264
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,984
If Veer is trouble,
Balli is big trouble.

265
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,710
I'm warning you,
keep your hands away.

266
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,086
You are a queen.

267
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,680
You aren't meant to martyr as a cop.

268
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:28,469
You are meant to keep
a king like me happy.

269
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,581
You...!

270
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:51,422
Your first crime, interfering
in police's investigation.

271
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:59,493
Your second crime,
touching a police officer's uniform.

272
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:03,844
Your third crime,
you touched a female police officer.

273
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,719
Under section 240..

274
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:09,547
324..

275
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:13,313
338..

276
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,000
You will all get arrested.

277
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:21,290
At least for 11 years.

278
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,993
Police has surrounded
you from all sides.

279
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:31,493
Drop your weapons..

280
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,102
Right where you are standing.

281
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:36,649
Drop your weapons!

282
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,352
Idiots!

283
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:40,578
What are you doing?

284
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:43,461
Why should we believe you
that there are cops outside?

285
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,305
Hey you, go and check.
Okay, boss.

286
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:48,688
Why should he go out?

287
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,407
Are you scared of facing a bullet?

288
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,251
He is fooling us, boss.

289
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:55,771
There are no cops outside.
If they aren't here as yet..

290
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,180
...they will be here soon.

291
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:58,363
There they are.

292
00:17:58,567 --> 00:17:59,830
Police has started to come on time.

293
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,951
Get him! Get everyone!

294
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:04,336
Sir!

295
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:11,016
Listen up! Sir!
Actually..

296
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:12,711
I came here at the right time.

297
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,531
I was on a bike.

298
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,882
But my team got
stuck in the traffic.

299
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:17,836
Hats off to you.

300
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:19,037
Thank you so much, sir.

301
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:20,581
Thank you.

302
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:23,528
I'm Balli.

303
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:26,030
I work here..

304
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,501
Your work was amazing.

305
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:30,504
What was so amazing?

306
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:32,454
It was straight out
of the movie Deewar.

307
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:33,959
Shashi Kapoor had acted
it out in the movie.

308
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,001
I just tried to match up a little.

309
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:38,133
This is the style big people.

310
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,078
They don't want to take any credit.

311
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,532
But I have to say,
we will meet again.

312
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:47,962
I am Rani Chaudhary.

313
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:49,322
Inspector Rani Chaudhary.

314
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,331
Golnakkar police station.

315
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:52,517
Thank you.

316
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,391
Cops shouldn't be thanking anyone.

317
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,671
It is their job to
provide the service.

318
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,813
It is the public who
should thank them.

319
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,906
Damn!

320
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,756
He ignored Rani Chaudhary!

321
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:11,761
Sir, if I may..

322
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:15,510
I extinguish the lamps at dusk..

323
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,377
Extinguish them.

324
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:19,260
Someone's memory sparks
my heart bright enough.

325
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:21,567
Someone's memory sparks my heart..

326
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,219
Wonderful..

327
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,541
Amazing.
Thank you.

328
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:26,362
It touched my heart.

329
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:28,813
Enjoy your drink.

330
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,542
Drink.

331
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:33,338
It's free of cost. Drink.

332
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,234
Sir, may I ask something?

333
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:41,105
Why do you always listen
to sad pain-filled poetries?

334
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,469
What happened?

335
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:47,796
My heart is full of
pain, Mr. Ghumra.

336
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:49,820
Oh.

337
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,399
I met a girl.

338
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:00,305
I fell in love.

339
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:01,924
Great.

340
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:08,174
And I also go an opportunity
to take things forward.

341
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,395
You should try the
Balushahi, sister.

342
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:11,955
No, thank you.

343
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:15,673
Well, I try to avoid
sweets to maintain my figure.

344
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,754
There..
Okay.

345
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:19,187
Come on,
why should anyone avoid sweets?

346
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:21,782
Take it, otherwise aunt..

347
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,914
Actually,
after my parents passed away..

348
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,805
...aunt was the one
who brought me up.

349
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:31,665
No one can be a better
aunt or a better mother than her.

350
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,712
And in near future, no one would
be a better mother-in-law than her.

351
00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:38,665
There, even uncle is here.
Look, he too is here.

352
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:40,458
Wonderful.

353
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,498
This house seems quite lively today.

354
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:44,070
He's..
Hello.

355
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,357
Hello.
He's my uncle.

356
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,119
He has played a double role.

357
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,743
As my father and as my uncle.

358
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,213
Hello.
Hello.

359
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:52,688
Hello, uncle.

360
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:55,110
I had given my approval
right after I saw your picture.

361
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,588
Balli..

362
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:59,133
I hope you have told
Sughanda about Mallika.

363
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:00,614
You haven't told her?

364
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:03,435
I'd suggest that you should
tell her everything before marriage.

365
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:06,635
You will face trouble if things
come out in the open after marriage.

366
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:10,750
He was crazy about Mallika.

367
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:13,196
Please have the Samosas.
Please.

368
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:15,993
You don't have to
take this seriously.

369
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:17,102
He loves to joke.

370
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,860
You know the forest
behind Barrakhamba?

371
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:21,066
Stop him. He spent three
nights with her there.

372
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,227
I told him to at least
change his underwear.

373
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:26,198
What are you waiting for Sughanda?
He is joking.

374
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,769
Who is Mallika? Underwear.
Please sit down.

375
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,258
Sister! Sister! Sister!

376
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,477
Please listen to me.
We have heard enough.

377
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:33,696
Please listen to me.

378
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:35,467
Sughanda!
Sughanda, listen to me!

379
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,977
I had just fallen in love..

380
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:41,718
And uncle's joke ruined it all.

381
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:48,094
Sughanda, I have been trying
to call you from so long.

382
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,055
The Mallika they are talking
about is Mallika Sherawat.

383
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,219
I am her fan.

384
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,321
I have seen Murder 25 times.

385
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:56,485
I was with her in
Barrakhamba's forest.

386
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:59,166
But that's because they were using
my cars for her movie's shooting.

387
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,711
Look, I am Anu and not Sughanda.

388
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:02,883
Sughanda's friend.

389
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,711
Sughanda's phone is with me.

390
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:06,732
Oh.
Hello, Anu.

391
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,165
Before the palace of
my love turns to dust..

392
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,891
...please help me talk to Sughanda.

393
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:17,790
By the way Mr. Balli..

394
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:20,126
Sughanda is taking her
third vow at the moment.

395
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,579
The palace of your love
has already turned to dust.

396
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
What?

397
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:27,128
Damn..

398
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:28,656
That..

399
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:30,805
Now the situation is such that..

400
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:34,906
I find peace not when
I try to heal the wound..

401
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:37,672
...but when I try to reopen it.

402
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:42,133
How about another one?

403
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:45,008
Hey!

404
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:49,890
Damn you!

405
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,135
Hello?

406
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,858
Well done, uncle.

407
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:14,452
You are having a good night's
sleep after ruining my life?

408
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,047
Leaving this 35-year-old
unmarried man to wander..

409
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:23,399
...in the desert of loneliness,
you lie there hugging your wife?

410
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,480
Have some shame.

411
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:27,726
You will get cursed.

412
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:34,039
You will not get married
for the next seven lifetimes, uncle.

413
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:37,398
You can go to sleep now.

414
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,850
Who was it?

415
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:43,992
Who else could it be..

416
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:46,398
...providing peace to my
soul in the middle of night?

417
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:48,616
Balli.

418
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:50,664
He loves you a lot.

419
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,350
Mom, I would like
to say a few words.

420
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:06,664
Go on, say it.

421
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,645
Thank you.

422
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:11,836
What does he want to say?

423
00:24:12,547 --> 00:24:14,172
He is just a kid.
Let him do it.

424
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:16,773
I would like to say something.

425
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:21,456
Today is a very big
day for all of us..

426
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:23,562
...because today is
my grandfather's birthday.

427
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:27,578
I don't know what a son
should do to honor his father.

428
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:32,211
But someone of my age should learn,
and I do just that.

429
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:37,711
I learn, when my father
does something for my grandfather.

430
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,913
When my father honors
my grandfather..

431
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,711
When he does charity in his name..

432
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:45,398
It makes all of us very happy.

433
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:49,538
And today, to share that
happiness with all of you..

434
00:24:50,131 --> 00:24:55,897
...dad has decided that all of
you get a month's salary as bonus!

435
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,198
There he goes again.

436
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,803
Hold on.

437
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:09,062
What are you doing?

438
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:10,288
A month's salary as bonus!

439
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:11,911
Did you ask uncle?

440
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,433
He was his father as well.

441
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,442
He was my grandfather too.
You didn't ask me.

442
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,271
How can you just declare
a month's salary as bonus?

443
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,575
You won't get a month's
salary as bonus.

444
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,319
You will 2 months' salary as bonus.

445
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:29,900
Okay?

446
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,379
Amazing.

447
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,556
Thank you, Balli sir!

448
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,352
Mr. Balli..

449
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:39,927
There they do another charity.

450
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:41,558
Two months' salary as bonus!

451
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:45,007
You two have made me lose 7 million.

452
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:51,434
Dad, you are only thinking
about losing your 7 million.

453
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,637
Have you ever thought
how much helpful..

454
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:55,552
...this 7 million will be
for all the workers? Right?

455
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,231
It will help someone's sister
get admitted into a nice college.

456
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:59,295
Someone will be able to
get his mother's eye operated.

457
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,957
Someone will be able
to change his kneecaps.

458
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:04,442
Someone will be able
to go on a pilgrimage.

459
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:05,803
Someone will be able to go abroad.

460
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,168
If some poor fellow is if your age..

461
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,661
...then he will be able to enjoy
a five days package in Thailand.

462
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:11,662
Right?
Exactly.

463
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:13,381
You will get so many blessings, dad.

464
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,967
You will live a long life.

465
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:15,831
Oh God!

466
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:17,801
Take this. And yes,
we aren't doing this for you.

467
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:19,385
We are doing all this for aunt.

468
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:22,485
My aunt should dress up like
this for another 200-500 years.

469
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:24,887
Right, aunt?
Yes, sure.

470
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:28,933
That's why I want you two
to continue with your good work.

471
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,356
You should give out a
few months' salary as bonus..

472
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,317
...on every birth anniversary
of your grandfather.

473
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:35,340
I will handle him.
Right?

474
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:37,048
Oh..

475
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:46,514
Our love will grow
if we eat in one plate.

476
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,543
You can do all that
after we get married.

477
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,270
You are so mean.

478
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,578
Okay listen..

479
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,147
Why don't you think
about our marriage?

480
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,849
I am thinking about that only.

481
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,690
First, let my grandson get married.

482
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:03,590
Otherwise, people will say..

483
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:08,270
"Look there, the grandson
of the marriageable age.."

484
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:09,830
"..and the grandfather got married."

485
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:11,185
Look!

486
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:12,691
Then why don't you tell them?

487
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:14,148
What should I tell them, sweetheart?

488
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:15,637
That we want to get married.

489
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:16,841
Don't worry.

490
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,401
If they are worried
about their son..

491
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:20,745
...they will find a suitable
girl for him on their own.

492
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,535
Okay, I will call them right away.

493
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,559
Hello?
Hello?

494
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:30,966
Father.

495
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:32,973
I seek your blessings, father.
God bless you.

496
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,231
Is everything fine?

497
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:35,979
Yes, with your blessings.

498
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,129
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

499
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:39,527
Tell me, what is it?

500
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:42,408
Have you found any
suitable girl for Veer?

501
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,228
We are looking.

502
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,789
You should hurry up.

503
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,536
We are trying.

504
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:50,017
Okay, I will hang up now.

505
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,294
Happy now?

506
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:57,191
We still haven't found
any suitable girl forever.

507
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:02,443
Sir, how many times
have I told you..

508
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:05,387
...that forget 70 acres,
I'm not even ready..

509
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:07,762
...to sell even a
small piece of land.

510
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:10,310
'Gopichand Bhalla is renowned.'

511
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,192
'He owns a confectionery shop.'

512
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:14,369
'He is only worried
about high blood pressure.'

513
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,474
'And there's a name
which makes him go mad..'

514
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,239
Listen,
what did you say your name was?

515
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,052
Prabhu Dayal, Prabhu.

516
00:28:24,025 --> 00:28:24,705
Hang up!

517
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,858
Disconnect it.

518
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:26,859
Cut the phone!

519
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:28,020
'He disconnects it.'

520
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:29,634
'For now it's just the phone call..'

521
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:30,309
Sir, we have received a big order.

522
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,278
'You will see what happens later.'

523
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,838
Prabhu and Prabhu industries..

524
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:34,075
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

525
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:35,911
Why are you taking that name?

526
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:37,271
Tell me the address.
Sorry, sir.

527
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:39,559
You deliver the order at
the address and not on the name.

528
00:28:39,665 --> 00:28:40,730
Sir..
Go.

529
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:42,970
Go and get the order ready. You are
bound to get sweets at the sweetshop.

530
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,260
You can pack whatever you want.

531
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,343
Strange.

532
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:46,989
Geet!
Hello, papa.

533
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,110
Hello.
Here's your lunch.

534
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:49,380
What happened?

535
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:51,652
Why are you out of breath?
No, it's nothing.

536
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:52,653
Just..

537
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,750
Tell me.

538
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,090
Nothing. Just pack some
'Russmalia' for me.

539
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:57,091
Okay.

540
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,605
Nitesh.
Yes, sir?

541
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:01,185
Pack that for Geet.

542
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:02,768
What is it called?
That..

543
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:04,771
What is it called?
What did you say?

544
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:06,950
Papa, Russmalia.

545
00:29:06,951 --> 00:29:08,359
Yes, Malia.
Okay.

546
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,457
Russmalia.

547
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,073
Pack it for her.

548
00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:10,777
Are you fine?

549
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:11,778
Yes, I am fine.

550
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:12,606
I am good.

551
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:14,137
It's was just that..

552
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:15,942
Go on.
Go.

553
00:29:16,843 --> 00:29:18,128
We are sitting inside.
Okay.

554
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:18,689
Let's go.

555
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:19,913
Let's go.
Yes.

556
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:21,564
Yes, hello?
Yes, Juhi?

557
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:25,545
Listen, I have sent
holy offerings in lunch box.

558
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:26,319
Okay.

559
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,664
Give it to everyone in the shop.

560
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,731
Okay, listen..

561
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:30,172
What's playing in the background?

562
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:31,989
Prabhu's hymns.

563
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:36,457
Juhi, how many times
have I told you..

564
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,539
...not to mention
Prabhu at one go?

565
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,978
I don't know why this name
makes my blood pressure shoot up.

566
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:44,572
My sugar levels rise.

567
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:46,174
I start shivering.

568
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,541
I am not listening to
it, Phoolan is.

569
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:49,686
I will switch it off.

570
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,868
Listen, if your blood pressure
is high then take a pill.

571
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,221
Okay.

572
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:58,450
I don't know why everyone
is mentioning this name today?

573
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,327
You have Dahi Bhallas?

574
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:02,368
Pack three pieces of them.

575
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:03,971
Pack it.
I'll pack them.

576
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:04,915
Three will be enough.
Okay.

577
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,349
It will be ready in a few minutes.
Okay.

578
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,003
Yes.

579
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:08,760
We should also pack some
samosas, right?

580
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:09,761
Yes.

581
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:12,099
Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening.

582
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,831
Also pack a dozen samosas.

583
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,471
Okay, madam. Right away.
Let's go.

584
00:30:17,753 --> 00:30:19,440
Geet, tell me something..

585
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:22,112
Why was uncle scolding
auntie for mentioning Prabhu..

586
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:24,613
Don't say Prabhu.
Why?

587
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,339
Papa will scold us
too if he hears it.

588
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
But why?

589
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:31,878
When mamma was in college,
she had a boyfriend.

590
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:34,444
Boyfriend?
Boyfriend!

591
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:36,068
His name was Prabhu.

592
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,973
Really?
I swear.

593
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:40,643
Mom made a mistake.

594
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:43,456
She told papa everything
about him before they got married.

595
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:44,640
She told him everything?
Yes.

596
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:48,519
From the time papa learned about
him, he started feeling insure.

597
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,421
We aren't even allowed to mention
Prabhu during prayers at home.

598
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:53,158
Really?
Seriously.

599
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:56,051
I'm telling you, just mentioning
the name makes him furious.

600
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:57,432
You are a donkey.
What's happening out there?

601
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:57,968
Wait.

602
00:30:57,969 --> 00:31:00,198
What is going on out here? Do you
come here to work or to fight?

603
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,199
No, sir! How dare you say that!

604
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,815
What's happening out there?

605
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,438
Have you two gone mad?

606
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,239
Why are you two fighting
like animals? Let go!

607
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:07,921
Nitesh.
Yes, sir?

608
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:12,104
Settle their accounts, wish
them goodbye and send them away.

609
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:12,581
Okay, sir.

610
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,868
You two know that
I prefer non-violence.

611
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,240
I don't like one
person hitting another.

612
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:20,665
Sir, he called me a donkey.

613
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,066
He said it and you believed
that you are a donkey?

614
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:27,456
And if you are a donkey then
you should sound like one too.

615
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,549
You don't need to say anything.

616
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:32,370
Pack your stuff and leave.

617
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:33,879
Goodbye!

618
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,839
Come on, let me settle
your accounts. Let's go.

619
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,729
Here son, have some butter.

620
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:47,229
You work really hard.

621
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:51,758
It is necessary to strength
your mind and body.

622
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:56,108
After all, you are carrying the burden
of whole Delhi on your shoulders.

623
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:57,791
Right, Tolaram?
Eat, son.

624
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:58,956
Yes, sir.

625
00:31:58,957 --> 00:31:59,811
You are absolutely right.

626
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:04,248
I too have started getting
a lot of respect because of him.

627
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:04,898
I swear.

628
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:08,666
I don't even have to
pay parking charges anymore.

629
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:10,096
They say:

630
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:12,104
Mr. Tolaram, you may proceed.

631
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:13,505
Would you like to go home, Tolaram?

632
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,245
No, I will go to the kitchen.

633
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:17,339
And check on the lentils.

634
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,752
What are you doing, dad?

635
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,090
You should eat some butter.

636
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,849
You need it more.

637
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:23,515
You are carrying a heavier burden.

638
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:26,932
Along with the factory,
you look after Balli bro and me too.

639
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,586
Enjoy it, dad.
Get healthy.

640
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:32,391
Your uncle in Phagwada had called.

641
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,430
He isn't my uncle.
He is like a father to me.

642
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,206
Yes, him.

643
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:39,711
He was asking when we
were getting Veerey married.

644
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:42,790
He has nothing else to do.

645
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,563
He keeps getting people married.

646
00:32:44,903 --> 00:32:46,128
He didn't say anything wrong.

647
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:47,857
It is not so easy to
find suitable girls.

648
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,099
It takes time.

649
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,476
First ask Veer, is he interested
in getting married to a girl..

650
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:55,561
Or a boy.

651
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:57,816
What if this mother's
boy has changed tracks?

652
00:32:57,817 --> 00:32:58,978
You keep quiet.

653
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,684
If you continue with
this you won't let..

654
00:33:01,685 --> 00:33:03,205
...neither Balli nor
Veer get married.

655
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,170
Oh.

656
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:07,508
You are talking about
getting me married?

657
00:33:07,608 --> 00:33:09,047
I didn't know.

658
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,800
I am feeling so shy.

659
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:12,656
Let me do one thing..
Let me get out of here.

660
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,857
I am getting late.
Listen..

661
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:16,549
You are always getting late.

662
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,550
But what are you always late for?

663
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:21,407
You think I am a useless,
good for nothing, loafer, right?

664
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:23,664
Let me finalize the Japanese deal..

665
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,063
...I will make my brand
get global reorganization.

666
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:34,383
Get the car.

667
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:36,865
What, Mr. Ghumra?

668
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:39,312
No new poetry today?

669
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:41,233
I am not high as yet.
Not fair.

670
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:43,210
You will have to recite one for me.

671
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:44,211
Let the evening set in..

672
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,125
Excuse me?
Yes.

673
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:47,844
Don't mind,
but why are you laughing?

674
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:49,519
This photograph?

675
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:50,801
My bro.

676
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:51,602
His name is Balli.

677
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:52,747
He is a very simple man.

678
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:55,219
Don't mistake him for a funny one.
No, it's not that.

679
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,470
In the collection of vintage
models of tragedy kings..

680
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,543
This new addition looks good.
Nice one.

681
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:05,360
Is she making fun of
him or praising him?

682
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:06,521
It isn't clear to me.

683
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,132
They ask who Galib is..

684
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,542
Someone tell me what
should I tell them.

685
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:10,543
Meaning?

686
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,880
You should get them
together right away.

687
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:15,401
With great difficulty,
we have found him an admirer.

688
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,947
Don't let her go.
Go.

689
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:19,797
Hello?
Yes, tell me.

690
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:21,115
Whom do you wish to talk to?

691
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,111
Mr. Balli?

692
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:24,364
Yes, I will give the call to him.
No problem.

693
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:25,360
That's great.

694
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:28,687
Nowadays a lot of people
seem to be interested in him.

695
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,172
Anyway,
now what do I tell you about him?

696
00:34:31,298 --> 00:34:33,338
He has the Shahrukh's
charm that he had in DDLJ.

697
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:35,944
Add Aamir's simplicity.

698
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:38,418
Also include, the intensity
Sunny Deol had in Ghayal.

699
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:41,539
And the light emotions
like Sanjay Dutt had in Saajan.

700
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,368
Cuteness of that
Salman had in Santaan.

701
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:46,281
Mix all this and in the end add..

702
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:51,109
...Kamal Hassan's bad
luck that he had in Sadma.

703
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,456
That's it.

704
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:57,969
The personality that
you finally get is Mr. Balli.

705
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:00,780
I suggest you meet him.

706
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:03,585
You will know how nice
he is only after you meet him.

707
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:08,201
If you don't like him, I'll
offer your lifetime serving free.

708
00:35:12,638 --> 00:35:14,450
What kind of a phone
do you guys give me!

709
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:15,631
I don't know..

710
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:17,699
These Chinese dual sim
phones are very strange.

711
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,804
I don't get it,
how does one receive call on one..

712
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:21,405
...when I am busy
in a call on the other.

713
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,559
It's okay.

714
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:25,024
Do one thing.. Send the
documents of the car home.

715
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,990
Okay?
Sure.

716
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:39,120
How did I go?

717
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:42,537
The Chinese phone's
excuse was a little lame.

718
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,330
But the rest of the
build up was fine.

719
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:46,319
Now it depends on
Mr. Balli's faith..

720
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:49,003
...whether he turns this
into happiness or sadness.

721
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:51,931
And the way Pammi
ran away from there..

722
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,661
He ran?
Yes.

723
00:35:53,662 --> 00:35:55,038
That's what I have been
trying to tell Chandan.

724
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,094
He just doesn't get it.
How can I run?

725
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:59,681
Pammi won't run even if there's
fire anywhere in the world.

726
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,258
And what if we are
trapped in a fire?

727
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:03,164
Bros are treated differently.

728
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,820
Anyway, you aren't the ones
who will get trapped in a fire.

729
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,555
You are the ones who start the fire.

730
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:09,382
Look there.

731
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:10,391
Two more.

732
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,201
That's 37.
35.

733
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:13,307
I too am keeping a score.
Still two short.

734
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:14,697
No, you made a mistake while
counting.

735
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:15,868
It's 37, I know.

736
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:17,852
You have no shame.

737
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:19,524
You are staring at girls over here?
No, no, no.

738
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:22,709
I got Samosas and Jalebis
from papa's shop..

739
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,118
...so that we can
have lunch together.

740
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,463
But we have just..
No, you are a very busy man.

741
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:27,470
Go and stare at girls.
Shameless fellow.

742
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:28,454
Don't talk to me.
Hey sweetheart!

743
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:30,816
Hello!
Take me along!

744
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:32,558
She feel shy.

745
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:35,424
Oh no.

746
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,063
Sorry! I made a mistake!

747
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:39,548
You are misbehaving with girls?

748
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:40,407
Let us go!

749
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,814
You have come here to eve tease?

750
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:45,765
Veer doesn't come here to eve tease.
He comes here to save them.

751
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:49,150
The Romeo gang trouble them a lot.

752
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:52,906
Everything has calmed down from the time
Veer has started sitting over here.

753
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:57,507
When a few like them have a
death wish, they show up here.

754
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:58,465
Get lost.

755
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,598
If I saw you again. I'll beat you.

756
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,182
Don't show me your face again.

757
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:04,463
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

758
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:06,916
Come let's go.
Where did they came from?

759
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,400
Come on. Now say sorry and move on.

760
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:18,291
Forgiveness is part of life.

761
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:23,010
Girls look more pretty
when they are angry.

762
00:37:25,824 --> 00:37:26,824
Sorry.

763
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,432
Sorry.
Sorry.

764
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:32,557
Sorry.

765
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:43,954
Jaggi, where are you?

766
00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:46,843
Papers are ready.
We need to deliver the car.

767
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:48,624
I was about to some, bro..

768
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:51,945
...but I had some rotten
Bhatures last night.

769
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:54,074
I keep visiting the
restroom every two minutes.

770
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,001
Wait, let me drink the medicine.

771
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,940
It is very bitter.

772
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:02,609
I'll suggest why don't
you deliver the car?

773
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,726
You know that we have to
deliver the car to a girl's place.

774
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,639
And I stay away from girls.

775
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,483
I know, bro. But the thing
is that I cannot make it.

776
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:12,530
Those Bhatures have
messed up my system.

777
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:13,967
You...!

778
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:18,293
What are you doing?

779
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:19,717
Mr. Balli is such a nice person.

780
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:21,158
Why are you cheating him?

781
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:24,046
I am doing this so
that I can become an uncle.

782
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,047
Wait, let me explain.

783
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:33,715
The thing is Mr. Balli
stays away from girls. Okay.

784
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:35,574
And he isn't ready to get married.
Okay.

785
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:38,112
But I have decided that
I'll get him married anyhow.

786
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,272
Listen to me, Neelu.

787
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,939
Papa has found match for me.

788
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,571
Some Major Gulati.

789
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:45,550
Papa cannot stop praising him.

790
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:46,925
Rinky!
Yes, papa.

791
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:48,400
I'll call you back later.

792
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,201
Rinky, listen..
Yes?

793
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:53,507
Come dear. Sit.

794
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,065
Look dear,
I have made this decision..

795
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,050
...to secure your future
and your happiness.

796
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:02,026
I don't want to delay
your marriage any further.

797
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:04,114
We will go to Chandigarh tomorrow..

798
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:06,339
...to meet Major
Gulati and his family.

799
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,439
But papa.. Either start
packing for Chandigarh..

800
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,604
...or within three
minutes prove it to me..

801
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:13,294
...that you like someone else.

802
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:14,815
Papa, give me some time at least.

803
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,026
Yes. It's will be on time.

804
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:17,929
Hey, I have been trying to call you.

805
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,171
Thank God you are here.
Come in.

806
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,979
Papa, you were asking
who's in my life?

807
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:24,722
Papa, it's him.
My love, my future, my everything!

808
00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:26,823
Thank God you came.
But I have come to..

809
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:27,820
Yes, it's okay.

810
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:29,183
Papa, he's the one.

811
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:30,184
I..

812
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:32,478
Okay..
The documents..

813
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,372
Very nice.

814
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,093
It's a pleasure.
It's indeed a pleasure.

815
00:39:35,836 --> 00:39:37,099
I am Colonel Vohra.

816
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,381
Balwinder Arora, Balli.

817
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:39,671
Oh, very nice.

818
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,111
Do you love each other or just..

819
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:45,452
No, papa.
He loves me a lot.

820
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:46,453
Right?

821
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:51,374
You know what?
You have come at the right time.

822
00:39:51,477 --> 00:39:52,695
Papa was trapping me.

823
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:55,071
Actually, I would've been totally
trapped if you hadn't showed up.

824
00:39:55,072 --> 00:39:56,554
Papa has chosen someone for me.

825
00:39:56,555 --> 00:39:58,174
But I don't like him at all.

826
00:39:58,175 --> 00:40:00,780
I mean I cannot marry
someone who is like papa.

827
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:03,101
But it's not that there
isn't anyone in my life.

828
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:04,102
There is someone.

829
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:05,418
His name is Tillu.

830
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:07,600
And he too likes me.

831
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:10,258
Actually, I too..
I too like him a lot.

832
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:12,021
That's why I did all this drama.

833
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:13,562
I am so sorry. So sorry!

834
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:14,958
It's okay.

835
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,549
These are the documents of your car.

836
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:18,743
Well..

837
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:19,952
Take them.

838
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:22,017
I am really very sorry
for what happened inside.

839
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:23,945
I didn't mean that.
I was just doing drama.

840
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:25,710
Please..
I was really just pretending.

841
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:26,734
I am so sorry. Listen..

842
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:28,523
Please listen.. Hello!

843
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,420
Hello?

844
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,449
Hello, Balli, it's me, Rinky.

845
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,325
Actually, you know what?

846
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,522
There is a lot going
on in my mind and heart.

847
00:40:44,523 --> 00:40:46,887
And I cannot handle it.

848
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:48,012
I tried calling Kanika.

849
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,234
Her phone is switched off.

850
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:50,309
Then I tried calling Kanchan.

851
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,410
She is entertaining guests at home.

852
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:54,076
And Neelu, her phone is unreachable
since the past two days.

853
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,574
No one has time to talk to me.

854
00:40:57,084 --> 00:40:59,551
Okay, can I talk to you?

855
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:01,713
Yes, tell me.

856
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:06,082
You know what?

857
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:08,615
I have had a motherless childhood.

858
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,215
Papa brought me up.

859
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:10,923
And you know what?

860
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:13,875
Papa only does what he wants.
What he thinks is right.

861
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:15,037
I mean it is going to happen.

862
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:17,755
When and with whom it will happen,
that subject..

863
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:20,168
Look Balli, I know that
we have had just a small meeting.

864
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:20,942
But I know.

865
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:22,793
Okay listen, I have decided that..

866
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:25,286
...I should leave with
Tillu while handling your case.

867
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:26,606
There are hardly any
days left in November.

868
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:27,258
I will leave with him.

869
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:28,122
And on top of that
Bhasin and Goldie!

870
00:41:28,123 --> 00:41:29,187
Their pressure is something
different all together.

871
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:31,806
And the person I love,
Tillu, he is so dumb!

872
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:32,744
I just don't understand.

873
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:33,921
I am dreaming about Gulati nowadays.

874
00:41:33,922 --> 00:41:35,658
He jumps four times
and five men fall flat.

875
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,443
Balli, hello,
are you listening to me?

876
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:42,100
Yes, I am listening.

877
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:43,141
Yes, of course, I am.

878
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:44,875
Gulati killed four people.

879
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:45,876
Go on.

880
00:41:48,251 --> 00:41:49,384
Thank you so much.

881
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:52,697
Okay then, you go to sleep.

882
00:41:53,548 --> 00:41:55,071
And thank you once again.

883
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,810
Good night.

884
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:03,563
Jaggi.

885
00:42:03,712 --> 00:42:06,368
Coming, bro.
Jaggi.

886
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:09,023
What's the problem
with Bhatia's car?

887
00:42:09,024 --> 00:42:10,261
He has already called
me 2 times since morning.

888
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:12,572
Forget his car, bro.
I will handle it.

889
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,284
There's a girl waiting
for you inside.

890
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:14,791
Which girl?

891
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:16,072
Colonel's daughter.

892
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:18,405
She said she wants
to talk to you urgently.

893
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:21,618
I'd suggest if things look
positive then you should go for it.

894
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,280
The wedding season is on.

895
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,810
You...!

896
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,095
I'll see you later.

897
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,103
Lord Almighty, please be with him.

898
00:42:31,794 --> 00:42:35,095
Balli, I couldn't sleep last night.

899
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,588
I don't know what I am doing.

900
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:40,243
And I don't know whether
what I am doing is right or wrong.

901
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
I don't know.

902
00:42:42,705 --> 00:42:45,447
I had that with Tillu..
What just happens..

903
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:48,150
And a girl does that only..

904
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,830
...when it happens to her
for the first time in life.

905
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,113
And you know what?

906
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:54,611
I don't have that with Tillu.

907
00:42:55,415 --> 00:42:56,725
I have that..

908
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:58,166
I have that with you.

909
00:42:58,673 --> 00:42:59,673
Yes.

910
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:08,906
You..

911
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:13,733
What is it that you..

912
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:18,897
Don't have with Tillu
and have it with me?

913
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:21,436
Love.

914
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:24,217
I don't love Tillu.

915
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,155
I love you.

916
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:29,866
And.. I want to marry you.

917
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:37,616
Yes, I agree that I was going to marry
him before you entered my life.

918
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:39,223
I used to love him as well.

919
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:41,944
But you know what?

920
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:43,905
From the time,
you have entered my life..

921
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:51,210
It's you I see
everywhere and not Tillu.

922
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:54,704
I think you..

923
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:59,001
You should get your mind checked.

924
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:02,478
Not my mind, my heart.

925
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,316
And only you can do that.

926
00:44:05,424 --> 00:44:07,571
Look, please..
Please don't reject me.

927
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:12,181
If you reject me then
I won't be able to live.

928
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,251
Do you..

929
00:44:15,977 --> 00:44:17,446
...know what you are saying?

930
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:20,191
Yes, I know.

931
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:22,337
And I am not saying so, my heart is.

932
00:44:22,338 --> 00:44:23,618
Look, listen..

933
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,618
Whatever I had with Tillu,
it was my childishness.

934
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:27,957
But..

935
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:33,665
But you are the one
I am actually in love with.

936
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:37,056
That's amazing!
That's amazing, bro!

937
00:44:37,919 --> 00:44:41,344
I knew that you two
are made for each other.

938
00:44:41,797 --> 00:44:42,931
God has answered my prayer.

939
00:44:43,152 --> 00:44:45,390
Jaggi's wish has come true!

940
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,446
That's amazing!
Hey!

941
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:50,632
She is your sister-in-law.

942
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:51,704
Being possessive, bro?

943
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:53,871
No problem,
she can be my sister-in-law.

944
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:57,992
"Not my fault."

945
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:06,493
"I like you, that's all I know."

946
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:11,124
"It was meant to be hence
I fell in love with you."

947
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:15,269
"I say it with all my heart,
it's true."

948
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:19,840
"It was meant to be hence
I fell in love with you."

949
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:23,601
"I say it with all my heart,
it's true."

950
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:27,072
"I only belong to you."

951
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,630
"So many faces.."

952
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:08,131
"I came across.."

953
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:16,405
"But my heart fell for you."

954
00:46:16,963 --> 00:46:21,190
"Love has brought me.."

955
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:24,311
"To a path unknown.."

956
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:33,316
"I find it difficult to survive.."

957
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,380
"It was meant to be hence
I fell in love with you."

958
00:46:39,493 --> 00:46:43,334
"I say it with all my heart,
it's true."

959
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:46,957
"I only belong to you."

960
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:49,018
"I love you.."

961
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:51,122
"I love you.."

962
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:53,195
"I love you.."

963
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:55,315
"I love you.."

964
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:57,462
"I love you.."

965
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:59,424
"I love you.."

966
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:04,435
Veer, why is it so loud?
Keep the volume down, son.

967
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:05,667
Mom, please.

968
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:06,704
What please?

969
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:08,628
Mom, sit in the other room.
Volume..

970
00:47:08,629 --> 00:47:09,661
Keep the volume down..

971
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,051
So that we can at least talk.

972
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,470
This is not the place to talk.

973
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:15,245
Hey!

974
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:18,501
There, Balli is calling.

975
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,121
You want to talk him?
No.

976
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:24,534
Hello?

977
00:47:24,535 --> 00:47:27,629
Aunt,
your wish is getting fulfilled.

978
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:29,475
I am getting married.

979
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:31,670
The truth, Balli?

980
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:33,807
Yes, I have found someone.

981
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:35,584
You should prepare for our wedding.

982
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:36,830
Come soon.

983
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:39,461
You see..

984
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:42,064
Balli has found a nice girl.

985
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:43,143
Good.

986
00:47:43,144 --> 00:47:44,285
Now tell me about your girl.

987
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:45,522
Huh?

988
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,092
Tell me about your girl.

989
00:47:47,093 --> 00:47:48,332
Mom, please.

990
00:47:48,845 --> 00:47:49,845
Listen..

991
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:52,134
My friend's niece is very beautiful.

992
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:55,490
She is lovely.
Should I talk to her family?

993
00:47:55,701 --> 00:47:56,221
Mom...?

994
00:47:56,602 --> 00:47:57,602
Dad wouldn't like that.

995
00:47:57,734 --> 00:47:58,734
He likes you.

996
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:02,178
I am talk about you.

997
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,755
Okay.

998
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:07,740
Mom, I am still just a child.

999
00:48:08,707 --> 00:48:10,026
And when will you grow up?

1000
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,037
Mom, please.
Let me play.

1001
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:15,967
Do you want to spend
your whole life playing, son?

1002
00:48:15,968 --> 00:48:17,139
When will you get married?

1003
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:20,108
And listen, what about that girl..

1004
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:22,787
...you take on drives
and burn so much gas?

1005
00:48:26,384 --> 00:48:27,678
Tolaram told me.

1006
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:29,699
Mom..

1007
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:31,334
Tolaram is a blabbermouth.

1008
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:33,249
Forget the blabbermouth.

1009
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,091
If you like her then
take things forward..

1010
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:36,691
...and introduce her to me.

1011
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:38,342
I will handle the rest.

1012
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:40,952
I have been telling Veer
to introduce me to everyone.

1013
00:48:40,953 --> 00:48:42,628
But he doesn't listen to me, auntie.

1014
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:43,248
Auntie?

1015
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,930
Don't address me as auntie, dear.

1016
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,287
Call me mom.

1017
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:47,455
Mom?

1018
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,620
Mom..

1019
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:51,437
It sounds so nice.

1020
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:52,842
Listen..

1021
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:56,724
He loves to hum Lataji's
songs while eating parathas.

1022
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,303
She is my favorite.
I love her.

1023
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:00,443
Really?
Yes.

1024
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,053
If he asks you to hum a little,
please do that for him.

1025
00:49:04,054 --> 00:49:05,326
Okay, sure.
Mom.

1026
00:49:05,757 --> 00:49:07,920
Her name is Geet,
but she cannot sing at all.

1027
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:08,921
Veer!

1028
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,006
He is always pulling my leg, mom.

1029
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:12,280
Don't worry, dear.
I sing quite well.

1030
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:13,654
Of course you do, dear.

1031
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:16,188
And he likes to have
kidney beans with paratha.

1032
00:49:16,393 --> 00:49:17,393
Right, Veer?

1033
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:19,446
I don't know how to
cook kidney beans.

1034
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:20,447
My paratha got burnt.

1035
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:22,623
Mom, it's charred.

1036
00:49:24,154 --> 00:49:25,715
Mom, the tea!
Switch it off!

1037
00:49:27,037 --> 00:49:28,037
Now.. This...?

1038
00:49:28,976 --> 00:49:30,255
I cannot do all this.

1039
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,280
I cannot do this acting.

1040
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:33,714
This is how the paratha
I make looks like.

1041
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:35,156
They get burnt or whatever.

1042
00:49:35,157 --> 00:49:36,157
This is how I make them.

1043
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,005
I told you before.
Why are you laughing?

1044
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:41,373
Forget about the food..

1045
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:47,474
What's more important that
she should have a good heart!

1046
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:48,576
And she has a good heart.

1047
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,108
You ate that charred paratha?

1048
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:55,584
Veer, this is the first time in your
life you have done something right.

1049
00:49:55,585 --> 00:49:56,826
You have found a nice girl.

1050
00:49:57,173 --> 00:49:58,173
Right?

1051
00:49:58,326 --> 00:49:59,326
Heard that?

1052
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:01,464
She isn't a good cook.

1053
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,209
Geet, you know,
I had gone my village.

1054
00:50:09,314 --> 00:50:11,347
My grandfather made me go crazy.

1055
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:13,076
He has chosen some boy for me.

1056
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,966
And even my father
cannot speak against him.

1057
00:50:15,586 --> 00:50:16,626
Are you getting me?

1058
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:19,157
What kind of a boy he must
be if my grandfather likes him?

1059
00:50:19,158 --> 00:50:20,198
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

1060
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,803
You didn't meet him
and he finalized everything?

1061
00:50:22,804 --> 00:50:23,552
No!

1062
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:25,304
All these oldies are just the same.

1063
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:27,626
Anyway, my grandfather
listens to his moustaches..

1064
00:50:27,627 --> 00:50:29,067
...and does what he thinks is right.

1065
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:30,174
This is a limit.

1066
00:50:30,175 --> 00:50:31,232
Seriously.

1067
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:31,912
Could you like some tea?

1068
00:50:32,014 --> 00:50:33,014
No.
Got liquor?

1069
00:50:33,305 --> 00:50:34,385
Whiskey or Vodka?

1070
00:50:35,177 --> 00:50:36,389
Here's my wedding invitation.

1071
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:37,800
Are you serious?

1072
00:50:38,189 --> 00:50:40,701
You fixed a date and
even got the invites printed.

1073
00:50:40,702 --> 00:50:41,702
Yes.

1074
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:43,037
Eager much?

1075
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:44,633
Eager, really?

1076
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:47,405
Rahul?

1077
00:50:47,813 --> 00:50:48,889
Such a filmy name.

1078
00:50:50,983 --> 00:50:52,103
It's a pretty invite though.

1079
00:50:52,267 --> 00:50:53,267
Thanks.

1080
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:54,501
Tell me something..

1081
00:50:54,674 --> 00:50:56,265
What's your status with Veer?

1082
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:57,726
I'm under a lot of stress.

1083
00:50:57,865 --> 00:50:58,923
Why?

1084
00:50:58,924 --> 00:51:00,506
I still haven't told my family.

1085
00:51:00,712 --> 00:51:01,712
Oh.

1086
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:03,796
You better hurry up.

1087
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,738
Otherwise, you too will have to
marry someone your parents choose.

1088
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:09,133
Only you can do that.

1089
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:12,046
Send 10 kilo Barfi
and 5 kilo Balushahi..

1090
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:14,232
...along with cashews
to Mr. Gupta's..

1091
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:15,233
Hello, uncle.

1092
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,281
Ria!

1093
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:19,809
I will call you later.

1094
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,479
Hello, uncle.
Hello, dear.

1095
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:23,278
When did you come back from Rivadhi?

1096
00:51:23,399 --> 00:51:24,544
We came yesterday.

1097
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:25,307
Okay.

1098
00:51:25,308 --> 00:51:27,028
And here's my wedding invite.

1099
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:30,160
That's great.

1100
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:31,854
Your wedding invite.

1101
00:51:33,228 --> 00:51:34,788
Congratulations.

1102
00:51:35,076 --> 00:51:37,686
It's quite nice and cheap.

1103
00:51:37,687 --> 00:51:38,687
Papa!

1104
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:40,557
I'm just joking.

1105
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:43,502
Uncle, all of you have to attend it.
Yes, all of us will attend it.

1106
00:51:43,503 --> 00:51:45,089
The whole family.

1107
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:48,125
Dear, you should
someone for yourself.

1108
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:51,708
Now you should find someone
for your best friend too.

1109
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:52,949
Papa!

1110
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:54,864
Uncle, there's Veer..

1111
00:51:56,122 --> 00:51:57,542
Veer?
Who is he?

1112
00:51:58,605 --> 00:51:59,765
Geet's boyfriend.

1113
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:01,597
Mad..

1114
00:52:01,704 --> 00:52:02,464
Boyfriend?

1115
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:03,605
No.. Shut up..

1116
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:04,954
Geet..

1117
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:08,167
Why are you making such gestures?

1118
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,650
This is good news.

1119
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:14,396
Why do you look so worried?

1120
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,527
You should ballroom in the room.

1121
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:21,546
Ria, she solved our
problem in no time.

1122
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:26,099
Look dear, if you like
someone then introduce him to us.

1123
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,520
We will talk to him.

1124
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:31,316
We will take things
forward and finalize it.

1125
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:32,317
Okay?

1126
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:33,887
Bye.

1127
00:52:34,405 --> 00:52:36,379
I'll go and give the
good news to your mother.

1128
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,786
Okay?

1129
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:37,834
Juhi!

1130
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:38,835
Juhi!

1131
00:52:39,013 --> 00:52:40,013
Juhi!

1132
00:52:42,438 --> 00:52:43,678
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1133
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,136
How did this happen?

1134
00:52:45,137 --> 00:52:46,160
I don't know.
Veer!

1135
00:52:46,161 --> 00:52:47,253
I'll inform Veer.

1136
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,238
What are you looking at?
Show it to me, please.

1137
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,381
No.
Please!

1138
00:52:51,382 --> 00:52:52,817
No!
Please.

1139
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:04,456
Listen..

1140
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:06,433
Don't talk much in front of papa.

1141
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:09,488
Papa loves to talk.

1142
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:11,503
I know.

1143
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:12,831
How do you know?

1144
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:16,211
Because all the
fathers are the same.

1145
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:24,621
Listen..

1146
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,816
Don't share the tales
of your bravery with papa.

1147
00:53:29,426 --> 00:53:31,652
He hates people who fight.

1148
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:35,402
Will you remember
what all I taught you?

1149
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:37,606
Please?

1150
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:39,028
What have you taught me?

1151
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:41,605
Madam..

1152
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:43,464
I am quite mind-blowing.

1153
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,097
I agree.

1154
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,832
Son, I was drowning..

1155
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,636
I started shouting for help.

1156
00:53:56,237 --> 00:53:58,159
A lifeguard came to save me.
Thank you.

1157
00:53:58,596 --> 00:54:01,285
But poor thing,
instead of saving me..

1158
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:02,745
...he himself got into trouble.

1159
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:07,905
It's okay, papa.

1160
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:09,266
Now I will teach you how to swim.

1161
00:54:13,327 --> 00:54:14,327
Papa?

1162
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:20,166
He got worried.

1163
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:21,090
Fine.

1164
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,091
I learned how to drown..
You can teach me how to swim.

1165
00:54:24,983 --> 00:54:25,983
Very good.

1166
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:38,819
Hey, you scoundrel!
What happened?

1167
00:54:40,386 --> 00:54:41,222
What are you doing?

1168
00:54:41,223 --> 00:54:42,309
Get lost!
Karan.

1169
00:54:43,294 --> 00:54:44,894
What did you say?
What did you say?

1170
00:54:45,638 --> 00:54:49,483
What did you say?
Are you trying to be smart.

1171
00:54:49,693 --> 00:54:50,857
Say it again. What did you say?

1172
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:52,137
Hey! What are you doing?

1173
00:54:52,988 --> 00:54:53,988
Who are you?

1174
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:10,940
Where are you, bro?

1175
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:12,982
Mummy, you didn't have anything.

1176
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,320
I am, son.

1177
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:19,071
I don't care about this world.

1178
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,610
Veer..

1179
00:55:25,946 --> 00:55:28,489
You should try the
Thandia papa makes.

1180
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:33,091
Dear, you know that I haven't
made it since a long time.

1181
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,187
No, papa.
You should make some for Veer.

1182
00:55:36,188 --> 00:55:38,347
Thandia keeps the mind calm.

1183
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:41,388
No. You are mistaken, dear.

1184
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,637
You don't need Thandia to keep calm.

1185
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:48,075
You need control to
yourself to keep calm.

1186
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:49,653
You need to control your anger.

1187
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:52,283
Hey you guys. Stop.

1188
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:55,345
Anyway, he doesn't need Thandia.

1189
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,966
Does he get angry?

1190
00:55:57,405 --> 00:55:58,978
Does he pick up fights?

1191
00:55:58,979 --> 00:56:00,219
Does he beat up people?

1192
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:03,409
He doesn't need Thandia, dear.
No, I don't think so.

1193
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,474
Papa, I will be right back.

1194
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:08,998
Veer, the food will go cold.
Let him go, dear.

1195
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:09,826
You can go later.

1196
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:10,886
I will be right back.

1197
00:56:10,887 --> 00:56:11,887
Papa..

1198
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,639
Come back soon, son.

1199
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:15,051
Okay?

1200
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:29,261
Look, your daddy's here.

1201
00:56:49,308 --> 00:56:51,828
See, how he's bashing them up.

1202
00:56:53,886 --> 00:56:55,240
What is that noise?

1203
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:57,654
Is someone fighting?

1204
00:56:57,655 --> 00:56:59,559
No papa, something must
be having on the street.

1205
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,143
Let it be, papa.
Let me go and check, dear.

1206
00:57:01,144 --> 00:57:03,357
Papa, why are you interfering
in someone else's matters?

1207
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:04,702
Mamma, tell him..

1208
00:57:04,703 --> 00:57:05,703
Calm down.

1209
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:07,379
Let him go.

1210
00:57:37,547 --> 00:57:38,547
Let's run.

1211
00:58:13,283 --> 00:58:13,922
Idiot!

1212
00:58:14,185 --> 00:58:16,297
He thinks I will let
my daughter marry him.

1213
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,711
Veer, I will call you back.
Geet!

1214
00:58:19,712 --> 00:58:20,892
Papa!
Give me your phone!

1215
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:24,706
Hey you..

1216
00:58:24,978 --> 00:58:26,023
Whatever your name is..

1217
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,630
Get this straight.

1218
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:31,937
Never try to meet
or call Geet again.

1219
00:58:32,571 --> 00:58:35,335
I don't want my daughter
to marry someone..

1220
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:37,179
...who raises his hands on others.

1221
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:38,898
Someone who is a goon.

1222
00:58:39,651 --> 00:58:40,651
Goodbye.

1223
00:58:45,248 --> 00:58:46,145
Papa, please..

1224
00:58:46,146 --> 00:58:47,146
Mamma, papa..

1225
00:59:16,357 --> 00:59:17,357
Yes, father.

1226
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:19,271
We have found a very
nice girl for Veerey.

1227
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:21,151
Yes.

1228
00:59:21,376 --> 00:59:23,005
You should make your preparations.

1229
00:59:23,304 --> 00:59:24,744
We will soon fix an auspicious date.

1230
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:25,853
Yes.

1231
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:32,496
What?

1232
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,913
They rejected you?

1233
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:36,839
Yes, brother.

1234
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:38,888
Don't worry.

1235
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:40,990
I'll talk some sense into Bhalla.

1236
00:59:43,828 --> 00:59:44,828
Bhalla!

1237
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,460
Bhalla!

1238
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:49,965
Who is Bhalla?

1239
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:55,981
How can you just barge in?
Didn't the security guard stop you?

1240
00:59:55,982 --> 00:59:56,982
Who are you?

1241
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:00,639
What's going on?

1242
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:03,095
I am Balli, Veer's elder brother.

1243
01:00:03,835 --> 01:00:05,514
So you think Veer is a goon?

1244
01:00:05,884 --> 01:00:07,787
Our family fights for the country.

1245
01:00:08,681 --> 01:00:13,747
You know my grandpa captured
Dacoit Durjan Singh.

1246
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:16,021
We come from a family of fighters.

1247
01:00:16,022 --> 01:00:17,451
And you think we are goons!

1248
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:21,990
No matter how hard you try,
you won't a boy better than Veer.

1249
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,410
I have only come here
to tell you that..

1250
01:00:24,612 --> 01:00:26,973
...if my brother's
feelings get hurt..

1251
01:00:27,428 --> 01:00:30,748
...then I will start a fire right
here and fry Immartis.

1252
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:34,279
I will make heartbroken
lovers sing outside your house.

1253
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:37,833
Taiyab Ali hates love, shame on you!

1254
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:40,257
You will lose your image.

1255
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:42,027
And forget about
your girl's wedding..

1256
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,240
No one will even show
up to buy your sweets.

1257
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:46,215
Got it?

1258
01:00:53,936 --> 01:00:55,529
You have 48 hours.

1259
01:00:57,308 --> 01:00:58,668
Come home and accept the proposal.

1260
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:00,506
Hey.

1261
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,360
Keep quiet.

1262
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:15,440
Now only Prabhu can save us.

1263
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:20,807
Balli, what you did was not right.

1264
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,518
She is still not
our daughter-in-law.

1265
01:01:24,086 --> 01:01:25,181
She is their daughter.

1266
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,924
Wait till the evening.
He will come bearing gifts.

1267
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:29,480
You just wait and watch.

1268
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:30,534
She is right.

1269
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,086
Why did you have to go there?

1270
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:33,719
Hello?

1271
01:01:34,005 --> 01:01:35,435
He got a call.
Have you gone crazy?

1272
01:01:35,436 --> 01:01:37,196
Is your whole family crazy?

1273
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:39,222
Why?

1274
01:01:39,374 --> 01:01:39,934
What happened?

1275
01:01:40,294 --> 01:01:41,297
What happened!

1276
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,932
Your brother.. What is his name?

1277
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:44,533
Malli?

1278
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:45,915
What is his name?

1279
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:47,494
Balli bro?
Yes, him.

1280
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,948
What does he think of himself?

1281
01:01:48,949 --> 01:01:50,589
He threatened my papa.

1282
01:01:50,784 --> 01:01:52,024
Papa is right.

1283
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:55,018
You are a goon,
your whole family is full of goons.

1284
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:56,823
You guys just don't have any sense.

1285
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,198
Good that your brother came
and showed us his true colors.

1286
01:01:59,199 --> 01:01:59,698
I had a narrow escape.

1287
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,760
And yes, there is a message
for your parents as well.

1288
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:05,401
Papa asked me to tell
them not to commit the sin..

1289
01:02:05,402 --> 01:02:07,321
...of trapping an innocent
girl from a good family.

1290
01:02:07,322 --> 01:02:09,619
They should look for
a girl from a family of goons.

1291
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:11,323
I am deleting your number.

1292
01:02:11,324 --> 01:02:13,062
Don't try to come after me.

1293
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,159
I am warning you.

1294
01:02:15,255 --> 01:02:18,034
These days government is
doing a lot to protect girls.

1295
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:21,034
Cops have been given thick batons,
so you better beware.

1296
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,350
Bye.

1297
01:02:32,089 --> 01:02:33,089
Sorry.

1298
01:02:35,136 --> 01:02:37,456
I ruined it for you.

1299
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,391
It's okay, bro.

1300
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:45,596
You didn't know.

1301
01:02:54,790 --> 01:03:00,032
Please have the juice.
Have some sweets too.

1302
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,098
Brother, you won't find
such sweets anywhere in Delhi.

1303
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:07,071
But you will find the complete
taste of Delhi in them.

1304
01:03:08,553 --> 01:03:11,603
Gets the Immartis.

1305
01:03:11,604 --> 01:03:14,266
Our special guest is here.

1306
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:18,094
By the way,
what did you say your name was?

1307
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:19,694
Prabhu Arora.

1308
01:03:22,193 --> 01:03:23,821
Just Arora.
Okay.

1309
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:27,064
Mr. Bhalla, my son..

1310
01:03:27,065 --> 01:03:28,922
Not a son, a goon.

1311
01:03:29,548 --> 01:03:30,668
Younger one is a goon.

1312
01:03:30,818 --> 01:03:32,438
And the elder one is a super goon.

1313
01:03:33,052 --> 01:03:36,149
One shamelessly breaks
bones on the streets.

1314
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:41,298
And the other wants to come to my
house, start a fire and fry Immartis.

1315
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:43,342
And now their father has showed up.

1316
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:44,783
The leader of those goons.

1317
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,028
So, what have you brought with you?

1318
01:03:47,538 --> 01:03:48,538
Firearm?

1319
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:49,731
Gun?

1320
01:03:49,928 --> 01:03:50,968
AK47?

1321
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:52,375
Atom bomb?

1322
01:03:52,684 --> 01:03:53,778
What have you brought?

1323
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:55,259
Mr. Bhalla, please listen to me.

1324
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,502
What's there to listen?

1325
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,932
Goons don't talk.

1326
01:03:58,151 --> 01:03:59,791
They use their hands
and legs to explain.

1327
01:04:00,675 --> 01:04:04,955
Look, even if you point a gun here..

1328
01:04:05,292 --> 01:04:08,690
...I won't let my
daughter Geet marry Veer.

1329
01:04:11,596 --> 01:04:13,252
I think you are done
with the refreshments.

1330
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:16,391
You should stand up and leave now.

1331
01:04:17,044 --> 01:04:18,044
Go.

1332
01:04:18,794 --> 01:04:19,794
Goodbye.

1333
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,640
Sorry, Mr. Prabhu.

1334
01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:30,024
I think he doesn't like my name.

1335
01:04:31,813 --> 01:04:32,578
Bye.

1336
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:33,579
Bye.

1337
01:04:38,322 --> 01:04:41,759
He wants Geet to marry his son.

1338
01:04:42,265 --> 01:04:45,118
Now it's my turn to trouble
him in the middle of the night.

1339
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:53,728
Who is calling me at this hour?

1340
01:04:57,108 --> 01:04:58,108
Hello?

1341
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:01,092
Hello, is that Mr. Prabhu Arora?

1342
01:05:02,091 --> 01:05:03,372
Yes, speaking.

1343
01:05:03,685 --> 01:05:08,520
Mr. Arora, I just had a fresh dream.

1344
01:05:09,146 --> 01:05:11,682
Do you know what I dreamed about?

1345
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:18,780
I dreamed that a lunatic
is eating watermelon in the market.

1346
01:05:20,489 --> 01:05:27,348
When I took a closer at him,
I realized that it is P.K. Arora.

1347
01:05:31,685 --> 01:05:37,297
Mr. Arora,
I can see signs of lunacy in you.

1348
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:41,481
You know what, you should
show yourself to a good doctor.

1349
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:43,940
It will keep the lunacy in control.

1350
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:48,083
Bye.

1351
01:05:49,786 --> 01:05:50,786
Who was it?

1352
01:05:55,186 --> 01:05:56,186
What happened?

1353
01:05:57,106 --> 01:05:58,471
Lunatic.

1354
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:01,115
Whom were you talking
to so late in the night?

1355
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:03,567
A lunatic.

1356
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:04,958
A lunatic?

1357
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,036
Have you lost your mind?

1358
01:06:11,882 --> 01:06:12,911
Oh Prabhu!

1359
01:06:13,071 --> 01:06:14,481
I hope I don't go crazy.

1360
01:06:20,629 --> 01:06:21,629
Good evening, sir.

1361
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:23,359
Good evening.
Is the report ready?

1362
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,340
What's the name of the patient?

1363
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:25,341
Gopi Bhalla.

1364
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:26,966
Wait for a minute, please.

1365
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:33,109
Hello?

1366
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:34,921
Hello, yes?
Hello?

1367
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:37,726
Hello, I can't hear you.
Hello?

1368
01:06:38,137 --> 01:06:39,444
Yes?
One, two, three?

1369
01:06:39,445 --> 01:06:41,731
Check up, check up?
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1370
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,682
Hello? Why can't I hear you?

1371
01:06:44,328 --> 01:06:45,557
You can't hear me?

1372
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:47,705
But I can hear you.

1373
01:06:47,706 --> 01:06:50,321
I don't know what is going on?

1374
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:52,167
Is my report ready?

1375
01:06:52,168 --> 01:06:53,568
Yeah, here's your report.

1376
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:55,089
Give me the report, sir.
Thank you.

1377
01:06:56,149 --> 01:06:57,309
Thank you.
Thank you.

1378
01:06:57,962 --> 01:06:59,235
Let me try again.

1379
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,336
Mad. He is completely mad.

1380
01:07:07,243 --> 01:07:09,518
Blood pressure, okay.
Uric acid, okay.

1381
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:10,939
Cholesterol, okay.
Sugar..

1382
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:13,308
Sugar, 600!

1383
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:15,537
Juhi, my sugar is 600!

1384
01:07:15,887 --> 01:07:19,032
Phulan, stop adding sugar in my tea.
Okay.

1385
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:21,621
I will give your bitter
gourd juice from tomorrow.

1386
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:23,075
Oh.

1387
01:07:23,994 --> 01:07:26,032
600! 600!

1388
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:30,372
Hello?
Not hello, bellow!

1389
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:34,184
When one's sugar level reaches 600,
he bellows.

1390
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:35,747
And you are saying hello?

1391
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:39,188
Remember my name, Prabhu Arora.

1392
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:46,009
Gopi..

1393
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,997
This isn't your report.

1394
01:07:50,397 --> 01:07:52,542
Look at the patient's name.

1395
01:07:52,543 --> 01:07:53,606
It's Mr. Thakur.

1396
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:55,780
Yes, it says Mr. Thakur.

1397
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:56,221
Yes.

1398
01:07:56,222 --> 01:07:57,900
So that means it isn't my report.
No.

1399
01:07:57,901 --> 01:07:59,543
It is someone else's report.
Yes.

1400
01:07:59,544 --> 01:08:01,307
That means I don't have diabetes.
No.

1401
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:03,410
It is normal.
Absolutely.

1402
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:06,407
Phulan!
Don't forget to add sugar in my tea.

1403
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:16,219
What does your father
think of himself?

1404
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:23,044
What?

1405
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:24,950
Your father loves to play pranks?

1406
01:08:25,419 --> 01:08:26,571
Not hello, bellow!

1407
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:28,767
When one's sugar level reaches 600,
he bellows.

1408
01:08:28,768 --> 01:08:29,996
And you are saying hello?

1409
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,387
Who talks like this?

1410
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:33,944
You know what your father told mine?

1411
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:34,482
What did he say?

1412
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,500
"That you were wearing torn clothes
and having watermelon in the market."

1413
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:39,676
Yes, so here the matter ends.

1414
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,363
Listen..

1415
01:08:40,525 --> 01:08:43,505
We cannot be together
if our fathers can't get along.

1416
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:46,106
What?
Why did you call me?

1417
01:08:46,303 --> 01:08:47,747
Do you want to sing a duet with me?

1418
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,013
I am not interested
in hearing you sing.

1419
01:08:50,403 --> 01:08:52,290
I wanted to find out
what's your mental condition.

1420
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:53,714
Oh, thank you very much.

1421
01:08:53,715 --> 01:08:54,623
It's absolutely fine.

1422
01:08:54,624 --> 01:08:56,544
And now that you are leaving,
it's even better.

1423
01:08:57,721 --> 01:09:00,025
Listen Veer,
our paths are different.

1424
01:09:00,273 --> 01:09:01,309
Same here.

1425
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:06,520
Then why don't you delete
my number from your phone?

1426
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:42,666
Wow!

1427
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,376
Beautiful house.

1428
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:46,968
Thank you.

1429
01:09:47,756 --> 01:09:48,756
Let's go.

1430
01:10:01,648 --> 01:10:03,261
You stay alone in such a big house?

1431
01:10:03,755 --> 01:10:04,829
Don't you feel scared?

1432
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:07,347
I do.

1433
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:09,102
That's why I have
brought you with me.

1434
01:10:09,469 --> 01:10:10,469
Come.

1435
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:22,513
This is my bedroom.

1436
01:10:23,217 --> 01:10:25,174
Sorry, it is a little dull.

1437
01:10:25,865 --> 01:10:29,501
You can add whatever colors
you want to it after marriage.

1438
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:37,257
Look Balli,
I want to say something to you.

1439
01:10:37,258 --> 01:10:39,204
I don't want to hear anything.

1440
01:10:39,205 --> 01:10:41,202
I agree to all your conditions.

1441
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:43,719
You just agree to get
married to me soon.

1442
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:47,196
Balli, I met Tillu for two hours.

1443
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,626
And in those two hours
I realized that..

1444
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:53,884
...Tillu loves me a lot.

1445
01:10:53,885 --> 01:10:56,813
And if I am not with
him then he will die.

1446
01:10:57,592 --> 01:11:00,356
Look, he is the only
brother to three sisters.

1447
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:04,658
And he is the only support
of his parents and old grandma.

1448
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,368
If.. If anything happens to
him then his poor mother will die.

1449
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:12,758
And if his mother dies
then his old grandma..

1450
01:11:13,329 --> 01:11:14,979
She too is gone.
She will die too.

1451
01:11:15,161 --> 01:11:16,553
Though she can live.

1452
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:18,899
Her knees, eyes and everything
else are working fine.

1453
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,980
Everything is working fine.

1454
01:11:20,202 --> 01:11:21,968
In fact, she can recognize
from a distance..

1455
01:11:21,969 --> 01:11:23,889
...that her favorite
Rinky is coming to meet her.

1456
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,346
Balli, I hope you understand
what I am trying to say.

1457
01:11:27,347 --> 01:11:31,763
I mean, you are quite sorted
and I know that you understand me.

1458
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:34,743
Balli, listen..

1459
01:11:35,869 --> 01:11:38,093
Please adjust in this lifetime?

1460
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:41,469
I will spend the rest of
the seven lifetimes with you.

1461
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,883
Are you leaving?

1462
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,272
Or should I throw you out?

1463
01:11:49,578 --> 01:11:51,037
'God, you are great.'

1464
01:11:51,514 --> 01:11:53,743
'You must have pondered
a lot before writing his fate.'

1465
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:56,715
'You first made Sughanda
leave him and now her.'

1466
01:11:57,374 --> 01:11:58,642
'This girl too is gone.'

1467
01:11:59,056 --> 01:12:01,898
'35-years-old Balli
still remains unmarried.'

1468
01:12:02,321 --> 01:12:04,391
Damn her!

1469
01:12:08,902 --> 01:12:10,016
Go and get water.

1470
01:12:15,982 --> 01:12:16,597
Hello?

1471
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:17,812
Where are you?

1472
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:20,962
You haven't visited the
garden since the past two days.

1473
01:12:21,524 --> 01:12:22,715
I hope everything's fine.

1474
01:12:22,848 --> 01:12:25,383
I haven't seen you
since the past two days.

1475
01:12:25,635 --> 01:12:27,401
You have seen my face enough.

1476
01:12:27,787 --> 01:12:29,773
But Shabbo.. Now if you want
to take things forward..

1477
01:12:29,774 --> 01:12:30,835
...then get married to me.

1478
01:12:30,836 --> 01:12:33,639
If you can't marry me then
should I find someone else?

1479
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:34,772
Shabbo!

1480
01:12:34,891 --> 01:12:36,196
Shabbo, listen to me.

1481
01:12:36,411 --> 01:12:37,411
Shabbo!

1482
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,495
Just a second.

1483
01:12:48,516 --> 01:12:48,976
Hello?

1484
01:12:49,513 --> 01:12:51,318
Prabhu, right?

1485
01:12:51,502 --> 01:12:52,278
Yes, father.

1486
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:54,350
You are old.

1487
01:12:54,605 --> 01:12:56,104
You have aged.

1488
01:12:56,394 --> 01:12:58,234
But how can you forget
such an important thing?

1489
01:12:58,345 --> 01:13:00,380
What's the status of Veer's wedding?

1490
01:13:00,854 --> 01:13:02,325
We are working on it, father.

1491
01:13:02,584 --> 01:13:03,584
What are you working on?

1492
01:13:04,097 --> 01:13:05,134
Hurry up.

1493
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:07,881
Life isn't just your
undergarment business.

1494
01:13:08,244 --> 01:13:09,284
It is much more than that.

1495
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:11,547
I am not into undergarment
business, father.

1496
01:13:11,777 --> 01:13:13,851
Don't tell me what you do.

1497
01:13:14,136 --> 01:13:15,902
You don't do what you
are supposed to do.

1498
01:13:17,923 --> 01:13:20,995
'Now will I get married
if Veer doesn't?'

1499
01:13:23,931 --> 01:13:25,083
Did you talk to her?

1500
01:13:25,582 --> 01:13:26,619
What did she say?

1501
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:30,827
I'd suggest we should
kidnap the girl..

1502
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:32,658
...get married in a temple,
seek blessings at the Gurudwara..

1503
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:33,866
...and there the matter ends.

1504
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:34,436
No.

1505
01:13:34,437 --> 01:13:36,395
Let me know if there
is any other option.

1506
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:39,813
I agree with Pammi.

1507
01:13:42,247 --> 01:13:45,127
You shouldn't run
too far after girls.

1508
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:47,817
It gets difficult to come back.

1509
01:13:50,235 --> 01:13:51,733
I have brought a new one for you.

1510
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:54,860
What are you saying, Balli bro?

1511
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:57,685
Look at her, you might like her.
I don't want to, bro.

1512
01:13:57,947 --> 01:13:58,947
There..
No, I don't.

1513
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,074
"Let me drink with your eyes."

1514
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,158
Even if there's no
light in my abode..

1515
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,471
"I wanna be an alcoholic tonight."

1516
01:14:18,472 --> 01:14:20,367
...my buddy's should
always be well lit.

1517
01:14:26,423 --> 01:14:29,932
"I feel like flying away with you."

1518
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:33,602
"I say goodbye to the
world and hello to you."

1519
01:14:33,736 --> 01:14:37,250
"I feel like flying away with you."

1520
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:41,269
"I say goodbye to the
world and hello to you."

1521
01:14:41,995 --> 01:14:45,528
"Get ready, be my buddy.."

1522
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:49,252
"Open up a little,
oh baby don't be shy."

1523
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:53,210
"Where are you going all alone,
tonight?"

1524
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:56,745
"Baby, where are you off
to, tonight?"

1525
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:00,392
"Where are you going all alone,
tonight?"

1526
01:15:00,393 --> 01:15:03,886
"Baby, where are you off
to, tonight?"

1527
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:08,571
"Where are you going all alone?"

1528
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:21,857
"Where are you going all alone,
tonight?"

1529
01:15:21,973 --> 01:15:25,429
"Baby, where are you off
to, tonight?"

1530
01:15:25,582 --> 01:15:29,499
"Where are you going.. All alone?"

1531
01:15:34,414 --> 01:15:35,995
"Why wander here and there."

1532
01:15:36,273 --> 01:15:37,826
"Come on baby, let's get drunk."

1533
01:15:37,985 --> 01:15:41,595
"You make my heart sing."

1534
01:15:41,761 --> 01:15:43,269
"You are like breaking news."

1535
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,992
"You cause a sensation."

1536
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,632
"What's your view about me, honey?"

1537
01:15:48,747 --> 01:15:51,090
"Oh baby, don't be crazy."

1538
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:52,631
"Come on, let's get a little tipsy."

1539
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,738
"Because all is forgiven tonight."

1540
01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:59,363
"Black dress,
backless, seeks my interest."

1541
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,870
"Rebellious, but what
make me rebel is your hotness."

1542
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:06,141
"Your eyes are like a 90ml shot."

1543
01:16:06,142 --> 01:16:10,034
"The high fails everyone,
but I am all set."

1544
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,894
"I feel like with you I belong."

1545
01:16:14,128 --> 01:16:17,628
"If you say yes,
I will take you along."

1546
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:21,158
"All night, about
love, we shall talk."

1547
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:24,651
"I'll sit with you on the rooftop."

1548
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,529
"I feel like with you I belong."

1549
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:31,832
"If you say yes,
I will take you along."

1550
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:35,527
"All night, about
love, we shall talk."

1551
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,825
"I'll sit with you on the rooftop."

1552
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:42,584
"This spark of love
is shines bright."

1553
01:16:42,738 --> 01:16:46,040
"I would like to romance
you under candle light."

1554
01:16:46,675 --> 01:16:50,175
"I don't want to be alone, tonight."

1555
01:16:50,342 --> 01:16:53,761
"Baby, I want to be with
you, tonight."

1556
01:16:53,912 --> 01:16:57,355
"I don't want to be alone..
Tonight."

1557
01:16:57,483 --> 01:17:01,899
"Baby, I want to be with
you, tonight."

1558
01:17:07,558 --> 01:17:09,806
"Move it baby on the beat."

1559
01:17:15,378 --> 01:17:16,838
"I don't want to.."

1560
01:17:20,907 --> 01:17:22,406
"I don't want to.."

1561
01:17:22,942 --> 01:17:25,862
"Lost in your eyes.."

1562
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:30,207
"I wanna to be drunk tonight."

1563
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:32,128
"Lost in your eyes.."

1564
01:17:33,803 --> 01:17:37,067
"I wanna to be drunk tonight."

1565
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:42,509
So this is the problem.

1566
01:17:42,686 --> 01:17:43,671
Okay.
Madam..

1567
01:17:43,672 --> 01:17:44,672
I get it.

1568
01:17:44,945 --> 01:17:46,292
My name is Rani Chaudhary.

1569
01:17:46,293 --> 01:17:48,053
You cannot hide anything
from Rani Chaudhary.

1570
01:17:48,286 --> 01:17:49,914
70,000 bucks is involved.

1571
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,105
Rampal.
Yes, ma'am.

1572
01:17:51,106 --> 01:17:53,026
Go inside and gather all men here.

1573
01:17:53,226 --> 01:17:54,224
Okay?
Yes, ma'am.

1574
01:17:54,225 --> 01:17:55,300
Can I leave, ma'am?

1575
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,220
Have a seat, madam.

1576
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:58,794
Rashida, give her some water.

1577
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:00,095
She already had water.

1578
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:01,252
Then give her a cold drink.

1579
01:18:01,253 --> 01:18:02,253
Okay, madam.

1580
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:05,245
Hello?

1581
01:18:05,483 --> 01:18:06,483
Tell me your name.

1582
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,667
Idiot, why don't you stop it?

1583
01:18:09,078 --> 01:18:11,100
How many times do I need to tell
you that I am not Rani Mukherjee?

1584
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:12,332
I am Rani Chaudhary.
Your cold drink.

1585
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:14,652
Stop troubling me, I am working.
Hang up.

1586
01:18:15,337 --> 01:18:18,777
Manager! Give me the details.
70,000 bucks is at stake.

1587
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,009
A complaint has been registered.

1588
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:21,734
And I need to find
out who is the culprit.

1589
01:18:21,735 --> 01:18:23,385
There are so many
characters around you.

1590
01:18:23,386 --> 01:18:24,230
Do you suspect anyone?

1591
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:25,522
Can I say something, madam?

1592
01:18:25,523 --> 01:18:27,232
This is what Rani Chaudhary wants.

1593
01:18:27,233 --> 01:18:29,000
You should open your
mouth and say something.

1594
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:29,721
I..

1595
01:18:29,722 --> 01:18:31,167
Madam, please sit down.
Don't worry.

1596
01:18:31,168 --> 01:18:32,870
Rashida.. She's already
had a cold drink, madam.

1597
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:34,259
Then get her an ice cream.

1598
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,337
What flavor would you like, madam?

1599
01:18:35,338 --> 01:18:37,877
Please tell us.
Vanilla, madam.

1600
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,191
Idiot! Don't you get it! I'm in
the middle of something important.

1601
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:42,192
I am working, you..

1602
01:18:42,872 --> 01:18:44,121
Sir!
Here's your ice cream.

1603
01:18:44,122 --> 01:18:44,652
Yes, sir.

1604
01:18:44,927 --> 01:18:46,310
No, sir.
What all we have to do!

1605
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:46,724
Okay, sir.

1606
01:18:46,725 --> 01:18:48,183
Okay. Okay, sir.

1607
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:52,357
Rampal!
Yes, madam?

1608
01:18:54,565 --> 01:18:56,102
By mistake, we have made a mistake.

1609
01:18:56,103 --> 01:18:57,970
The incident took
place at some other mall.

1610
01:18:57,971 --> 01:18:58,971
We are at the wrong mall.

1611
01:18:59,136 --> 01:19:00,288
Rashida..
Yes, madam?

1612
01:19:00,289 --> 01:19:00,705
Let's go.

1613
01:19:00,706 --> 01:19:02,698
Okay, madam.
Manager, please forgive us.

1614
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,391
By mistake, I made a mistake.

1615
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:07,012
You sometimes end up making mistakes
while doing your duty seriously.

1616
01:19:07,013 --> 01:19:08,542
Sorry, I got too serious.
Okay.

1617
01:19:08,698 --> 01:19:09,886
Madam, you too may leave.

1618
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:11,999
Now I will leave only
after I finish the ice cream.

1619
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,391
As you wish.

1620
01:19:13,392 --> 01:19:14,392
Let's go.

1621
01:19:15,761 --> 01:19:18,452
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Search everyone!

1622
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,317
All those who have given
money by Bunty, please pay up..

1623
01:19:21,318 --> 01:19:23,079
...otherwise,
you will be sent to prison.

1624
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,940
Bunty, you fooled me
and came to a mall?

1625
01:19:25,941 --> 01:19:27,795
You are having a
good time over here!

1626
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:29,434
You are giving 500 Rs as in tip.

1627
01:19:29,435 --> 01:19:30,625
Take him along!

1628
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,193
You fool Rani Chaudhary!

1629
01:19:32,194 --> 01:19:34,175
What are you saying?
I don't understand.

1630
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:35,389
Let me explain that again.

1631
01:19:35,665 --> 01:19:38,605
Cancel one Sherwani and two Kurtas.

1632
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:39,303
Okay.

1633
01:19:39,463 --> 01:19:41,847
The rest is as it is.

1634
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:44,870
But the Sherwani is for the
groom, sir.

1635
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:46,945
Why are you looking at me?
I am not the groom.

1636
01:19:47,135 --> 01:19:49,839
So you are asking me to cancel
the two turbans for the groom?

1637
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,589
Not both the turbans.

1638
01:19:51,852 --> 01:19:53,196
Cancel one turban.

1639
01:19:53,435 --> 01:19:55,700
But the turban is for the
groom, sir.

1640
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:56,736
You are repeating
the same thing again.

1641
01:19:56,737 --> 01:20:00,308
This turban is for my brother
Veerey who is getting married.

1642
01:20:00,452 --> 01:20:02,339
Got it?
And your wedding?

1643
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:06,809
Look there are three single men.

1644
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:09,550
Rahul, Salman-bhai and me.

1645
01:20:10,084 --> 01:20:13,809
We have decided that we
will all get married together.

1646
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,052
Now do you get me?

1647
01:20:15,053 --> 01:20:16,551
He wants to know about my marriage.

1648
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:19,010
Listen up!

1649
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:20,083
I have handled the clothes too.

1650
01:20:20,084 --> 01:20:22,261
Listen up!
You refuse to recognize me!

1651
01:20:22,788 --> 01:20:25,136
I smiled and yet you
didn't recognize me.

1652
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:30,250
If even I smile at someone just
once, he will never forget me.

1653
01:20:30,251 --> 01:20:31,456
My name is Rani Chaudhary.

1654
01:20:31,605 --> 01:20:33,063
Why should I remember you?

1655
01:20:33,939 --> 01:20:35,052
Are you Katrina?

1656
01:20:35,443 --> 01:20:37,056
Kangana?
Aishwariya?

1657
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,206
Even if you are,
it makes no difference to me.

1658
01:20:41,195 --> 01:20:44,267
That day you reached before
the team and got into trouble.

1659
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:46,172
Today you must have surely
caused trouble in the mall.

1660
01:20:46,173 --> 01:20:47,810
How will anyone want
to remember you?

1661
01:20:48,907 --> 01:20:50,461
You aren't worth remembering.

1662
01:20:51,877 --> 01:20:54,373
Rani Chaudhary is so polite to you.

1663
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:56,597
But you.. You don't seem
to let go of your attitude.

1664
01:20:56,598 --> 01:20:57,984
I too have some respect here.

1665
01:20:57,985 --> 01:20:59,637
You can try being polite?

1666
01:21:00,028 --> 01:21:01,427
A little, maybe?

1667
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:05,050
I am in a mess today.

1668
01:21:05,473 --> 01:21:06,906
Please spare me.

1669
01:21:06,907 --> 01:21:08,505
It's a big deal that
I am even talking to you.

1670
01:21:08,506 --> 01:21:09,773
Mr. Balli!

1671
01:21:17,324 --> 01:21:19,211
Sorry if I was rude.

1672
01:21:19,212 --> 01:21:21,745
Do the duty with all your
heart, okay?

1673
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:25,501
Hello?

1674
01:21:25,502 --> 01:21:28,704
Listen, we will have to
find a girl for Veerey soon.

1675
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:30,839
Darling, I will come directly
home from the factory.

1676
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,220
I will get a few girls
along if I find any on the way.

1677
01:21:33,543 --> 01:21:35,722
If you like any of them,
you can finalize her.

1678
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:38,620
Hey, we are talking about
our son's wedding here.

1679
01:21:38,919 --> 01:21:40,933
This isn't like grocery shopping.

1680
01:21:41,338 --> 01:21:43,324
We should find a suitable one.

1681
01:21:43,325 --> 01:21:45,198
The way your father was talking..

1682
01:21:45,516 --> 01:21:47,858
...it felt like he is
all set to get married.

1683
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:51,130
He was saying that he'd
go to Switzerland on honeymoon.

1684
01:21:51,552 --> 01:21:52,760
Switzerland!
Really?

1685
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,066
If he goes to Switzerland
for his honeymoon..

1686
01:21:56,289 --> 01:21:59,331
...then we'll have to go to the
moon to find a girl for our Veerey.

1687
01:22:00,468 --> 01:22:03,272
All our relatives will laugh at us.

1688
01:22:03,411 --> 01:22:04,869
Okay,
we will talk once I reach home.

1689
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:05,870
I'll hang up now.

1690
01:22:06,884 --> 01:22:08,112
He never listens..

1691
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:09,668
Oh God!

1692
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:11,429
The situation in my
house is quite different.

1693
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:15,361
My grandfather's brother
wants to marry for the second time.

1694
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:16,665
What?
Can you believe it?

1695
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,784
He's 90 plus.
Yes!

1696
01:22:19,391 --> 01:22:21,481
And my family wants
me to be done with my first.

1697
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:22,942
This is great.

1698
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,159
Mummy shows me pictures
of new girls every day.

1699
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:26,915
Sometimes it's this girl
sometimes it's that girl.

1700
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:28,492
Her brother does this,
her father does that.

1701
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:31,065
I told her to get me married
to any girl that she likes.

1702
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:32,316
Really?
Then what!

1703
01:22:32,523 --> 01:22:33,716
Well, I will have to listen to her.
Of course..

1704
01:22:33,717 --> 01:22:34,719
...you should always
listen to your mother.

1705
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,589
Of course, you should.

1706
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:36,319
Right.

1707
01:22:36,442 --> 01:22:38,479
Papa has started looking
for suitable boys for me.

1708
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,590
And you are cracking jokes
over here. Geet.. Okay, fine.

1709
01:22:39,591 --> 01:22:40,705
But please listen to me.

1710
01:22:41,762 --> 01:22:45,436
So, the first one looks like
Aishwariya Rai.

1711
01:22:45,437 --> 01:22:46,941
She has blue eyes.

1712
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,077
Perfect big eyes.

1713
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:49,713
She is just a shade darker than me.

1714
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:51,114
But that's okay, it doesn't matter.

1715
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,493
Color doesn't matter.

1716
01:22:52,899 --> 01:22:55,472
The second one,
she is exactly like Katrina.

1717
01:22:55,832 --> 01:22:57,140
Oh.
Really.

1718
01:22:57,141 --> 01:22:59,861
If both of them stand together, no
one will be able to differentiate.

1719
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:01,401
She is a little short,
but that's okay.

1720
01:23:01,402 --> 01:23:02,522
She'll match with my height.

1721
01:23:03,051 --> 01:23:04,628
Doesn't matter.
Oh, you are so adjusting.

1722
01:23:04,629 --> 01:23:05,857
Obviously.
Right.

1723
01:23:06,447 --> 01:23:08,736
Yesterday,
I told mom that she has me in a fix.

1724
01:23:08,737 --> 01:23:11,009
When I turn over on the bed I night,
on one side there's Katrina..

1725
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:12,277
...and Aishwariya on the other.

1726
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,097
Listen..

1727
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:18,835
These Katrina, Kareena,
Aishwariya, Naagina, Paseena..

1728
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:21,231
...whoever they are, whatever
you want to do with them, do it.

1729
01:23:21,232 --> 01:23:21,886
Got it?

1730
01:23:22,177 --> 01:23:24,213
There is just one girl made for you,
Geet Bhalla.

1731
01:23:24,528 --> 01:23:27,597
The sooner you understand
that the better.

1732
01:23:32,968 --> 01:23:34,745
SIsn't tonight enough to understand?

1733
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:02,649
Who are you?
Sit down!

1734
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:05,263
Veerey, Mr. Bhalla has
called this guy, Amardeep..

1735
01:24:05,264 --> 01:24:06,632
...to talk about marriage with Geet.

1736
01:24:06,633 --> 01:24:08,898
So you want to be
Bhalla's son-in-law?

1737
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,421
Get some snacks.

1738
01:24:11,943 --> 01:24:12,943
Have some.

1739
01:24:16,188 --> 01:24:17,444
Have you seen Geet's picture?

1740
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:19,989
Yes.

1741
01:24:20,609 --> 01:24:22,609
Have you started dreaming about her?

1742
01:24:23,756 --> 01:24:24,756
Yes, bro.

1743
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:26,059
She is awesome.

1744
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:33,013
We are here to help you.

1745
01:24:33,446 --> 01:24:34,446
Right?

1746
01:24:34,821 --> 01:24:37,084
We have brought you here
so that you don't get rejected.

1747
01:24:37,647 --> 01:24:39,807
This poor guy got rejected.
Tell him what had happened.

1748
01:24:40,266 --> 01:24:40,996
Bro..

1749
01:24:41,204 --> 01:24:43,351
He asked me, do you have courage?

1750
01:24:43,623 --> 01:24:44,896
I said, yes, I do.

1751
01:24:44,897 --> 01:24:47,786
Then he asked, can you hit ten people
on the streets all by yourself?

1752
01:24:48,093 --> 01:24:51,023
I said.. I can manage to hit a few.

1753
01:24:51,164 --> 01:24:53,492
If there are many then I
can use a rod to hit on their heads.

1754
01:24:53,493 --> 01:24:55,834
And I told him what
happened at the petrol pump.

1755
01:24:56,088 --> 01:24:59,257
I hit five people
with hockey sticks.

1756
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:00,364
Your turn.

1757
01:25:00,365 --> 01:25:01,796
Don't ask what happened with me.

1758
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:04,381
He had beaten two,
he had beaten five..

1759
01:25:04,645 --> 01:25:07,206
If you can see my size and guess..

1760
01:25:07,207 --> 01:25:09,257
I didn't get you.

1761
01:25:09,386 --> 01:25:11,308
He had beaten two, he had beaten
five.. He still doesn't get it.

1762
01:25:11,309 --> 01:25:12,507
Explain it to him, Veerey.

1763
01:25:12,653 --> 01:25:17,319
Coming to the point, Mr. Bhalla needs
to know what your hands can do.

1764
01:25:17,436 --> 01:25:19,417
The strength in your hands.

1765
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:22,231
He wants to know how
strong my hands are, right?

1766
01:25:22,232 --> 01:25:23,232
I understood.

1767
01:25:24,858 --> 01:25:25,858
Here.
Thank you.

1768
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,410
Thank you.

1769
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:29,376
Yes, uncle.

1770
01:25:29,377 --> 01:25:30,531
Son, tell me something..

1771
01:25:30,532 --> 01:25:31,148
Yes, uncle?

1772
01:25:31,277 --> 01:25:32,358
What did you say your name was?

1773
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:34,656
Amardeep.
Amardeep, very good name.

1774
01:25:34,657 --> 01:25:35,669
It's a very good name.

1775
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:37,321
What's your education level?

1776
01:25:37,856 --> 01:25:40,378
And what special
talent do you have that..

1777
01:25:40,533 --> 01:25:42,616
...I should get my
daughter married to you?

1778
01:25:43,642 --> 01:25:45,332
I don't want to praise myself..

1779
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:47,257
...but my talent lies
in my hands, uncle.

1780
01:25:48,289 --> 01:25:51,881
Uncle, I started raising
my hands in college itself.

1781
01:25:51,882 --> 01:25:54,452
I don't even need a hockey stick.

1782
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:58,772
I thrashed many goons
using these very hands.

1783
01:25:58,773 --> 01:25:59,309
Yes.

1784
01:25:59,448 --> 01:26:01,737
Uncle, all my friends used to say..

1785
01:26:01,738 --> 01:26:03,944
...that there are only
two real men in this world.

1786
01:26:04,295 --> 01:26:06,297
One's Sunny Deol and the
other, Amardeep.

1787
01:26:06,298 --> 01:26:07,840
That is me.
Okay, uncle?

1788
01:26:07,841 --> 01:26:10,838
Uncle, though I don't
raise my hand much.

1789
01:26:10,839 --> 01:26:12,999
But when I do, oh the way I do!

1790
01:26:13,197 --> 01:26:15,052
Let me tell you what
happened day before yesterday.

1791
01:26:15,053 --> 01:26:19,421
I thrashed a guy so badly that
the poor guy is still in the ICU.

1792
01:26:19,585 --> 01:26:21,382
He's in coma.

1793
01:26:22,404 --> 01:26:24,268
Uncle, power!

1794
01:26:24,269 --> 01:26:26,727
The power of the hands!
Take a look.

1795
01:26:26,919 --> 01:26:29,877
I just need your blessings, uncle.
Here you go.

1796
01:26:34,645 --> 01:26:35,874
What did you do?

1797
01:26:36,919 --> 01:26:40,106
People offer milk to a snake,
I am offering him buttermilk.

1798
01:26:47,064 --> 01:26:47,525
Then?

1799
01:26:47,733 --> 01:26:48,538
Then what?

1800
01:26:48,684 --> 01:26:50,954
Papa bathed him in
buttermilk and threw him out.

1801
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:52,476
Oh no!

1802
01:26:58,132 --> 01:27:01,356
Sorry Geet, but your dad
is one piece in the world.

1803
01:27:01,863 --> 01:27:02,863
Only one piece.

1804
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:05,716
Tell me, what are you
doing with the next one?

1805
01:27:05,717 --> 01:27:06,726
Relax, relax.

1806
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,968
Balli bro is handling our this case.

1807
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:10,890
And remember one thing..

1808
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:13,304
It is quite important for Mr.
Bhalla to know..

1809
01:27:13,305 --> 01:27:15,685
...how a man starts
his married life.

1810
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,405
Honeymoon.
Make sure you talk about honeymoon.

1811
01:27:24,196 --> 01:27:25,401
Wow uncle, buttermilk!

1812
01:27:25,402 --> 01:27:26,413
I love buttermilk.

1813
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:27,776
If you don't mind,
auntie and uncle..

1814
01:27:27,777 --> 01:27:28,972
...can I just try some buttermilk?

1815
01:27:28,973 --> 01:27:30,256
Sure, why not?

1816
01:27:30,257 --> 01:27:31,328
Thank you.

1817
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,403
It's from our shop.
Wonderful.

1818
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:34,610
Amazing.

1819
01:27:34,611 --> 01:27:36,593
Son, what do you plan
to do after the wedding?

1820
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:40,085
I've planned to go to
Switzerland for my honeymoon.

1821
01:27:40,992 --> 01:27:43,547
We will shop in Dubai for the first
two days.

1822
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:45,788
After that a chartered
flight to Switzerland.

1823
01:27:47,591 --> 01:27:51,241
But uncle,
if we don't like the climate there..

1824
01:27:51,704 --> 01:27:52,740
...then we will go to Paris.

1825
01:27:52,741 --> 01:27:53,476
Paris!

1826
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:56,855
We don't need to worry since
it is a chartered plane. Yes.

1827
01:27:57,227 --> 01:27:59,723
I believe in having
a great honeymoon.

1828
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:02,593
Uncle,
this will be my first honeymoon.

1829
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,484
Is this a first for
your daughter as well?

1830
01:28:04,485 --> 01:28:06,873
(Indistinct.

1831
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:13,802
Hey Mr. Frequent Flyer!

1832
01:28:14,015 --> 01:28:15,810
What is it, uncle?
Stand up.

1833
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:17,804
What happened?
And get out.

1834
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:20,100
And not hug me before you leave..

1835
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:21,549
I believe in non-violence.

1836
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:26,811
If I get violent then I'll
squeeze you to then when you hug me.

1837
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:29,263
Go, and fly in your plane..

1838
01:28:29,485 --> 01:28:33,017
...and go on a honeymoon with a girl
who has already been on a honeymoon.

1839
01:28:33,252 --> 01:28:34,828
Get lost!
Uncle! Uncle!

1840
01:28:34,829 --> 01:28:35,830
Security!
Uncle!

1841
01:28:35,831 --> 01:28:37,232
Escort him to his plane.

1842
01:28:38,318 --> 01:28:40,536
He wants to go on a
honeymoon with my daughter.

1843
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:42,219
Idiot.

1844
01:28:49,676 --> 01:28:50,676
Dude.

1845
01:28:51,649 --> 01:28:52,649
Hey dude.

1846
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,400
That's it.

1847
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,190
This western "dude" culture
is making the young of our country..

1848
01:28:58,191 --> 01:29:00,266
...stay away from milk
and ghee.

1849
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:02,639
They like burger
more than their home.

1850
01:29:02,877 --> 01:29:04,183
They like pizza more
than their brother-in-law.

1851
01:29:04,184 --> 01:29:06,065
And momos more than their uncles.

1852
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:10,165
That's why our
company is trying to..

1853
01:29:10,419 --> 01:29:12,531
...keep the youth
of country healthy..

1854
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,839
...with milk,
ghee, yogurt and buttermilk.

1855
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:20,597
That's why after Tau Ghee,
soon our company..

1856
01:29:20,794 --> 01:29:22,434
...is also going to
launch Tau buttermilk.

1857
01:29:22,783 --> 01:29:26,011
Because east or west
Haryana is the best.

1858
01:29:26,584 --> 01:29:28,344
Its milk and yogurt
are better than the rest.

1859
01:29:29,395 --> 01:29:30,854
Long live our soldiers!

1860
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:35,810
Thank you.

1861
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:43,639
Sir! Sir! Sir!
One picture, sir!

1862
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,960
K. K. Sir! What's the reason
behind launching Tau Ghee?

1863
01:29:46,179 --> 01:29:47,859
Please tell us, sir.
Why Tau Ghee, sir?

1864
01:29:50,146 --> 01:29:53,602
Tau Ghee will soon
be available in the market.

1865
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,406
Thank you. Thank you.
Move.

1866
01:29:56,407 --> 01:29:57,599
Come this way, sir. Come.

1867
01:29:58,974 --> 01:30:01,065
Mr. KK! Mr. KK!

1868
01:30:01,284 --> 01:30:02,753
It's okay.
Hello.

1869
01:30:03,104 --> 01:30:04,104
Hello.

1870
01:30:04,272 --> 01:30:06,628
First of all,
I would like to thank..

1871
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:09,328
...for ordering sweets from my shop.
Yes.

1872
01:30:09,329 --> 01:30:11,853
Secondly,
after listening to your thoughts..

1873
01:30:11,854 --> 01:30:14,159
...I have become a
huge fan of yours.

1874
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,273
Thank you.

1875
01:30:15,532 --> 01:30:17,798
You have a great style.

1876
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:19,166
Dude!

1877
01:30:19,351 --> 01:30:20,351
Dude!

1878
01:30:21,185 --> 01:30:24,214
You have a great style
and a great heart.

1879
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,363
You are linked to your roots.

1880
01:30:26,364 --> 01:30:28,694
Thank you for your polite words.

1881
01:30:29,112 --> 01:30:31,591
But I don't think I
have anything special in me.

1882
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:35,136
Being a human being it
is our duty to love each other..

1883
01:30:35,137 --> 01:30:36,252
...and respect our elders.

1884
01:30:36,253 --> 01:30:40,806
What a noble thought!

1885
01:30:40,913 --> 01:30:42,826
Excuse me, I need to leave now.

1886
01:30:42,827 --> 01:30:44,581
I need to attend a mass marriage.

1887
01:30:44,865 --> 01:30:47,697
I have taken up the responsibility
of marrying a few poor couples.

1888
01:30:48,256 --> 01:30:49,294
That's great.

1889
01:30:49,923 --> 01:30:53,150
After hearing this I have
become a double fan of yours.

1890
01:30:54,502 --> 01:30:56,306
Bye.
Goodbye.

1891
01:31:00,031 --> 01:31:05,522
Goddess, he needs to
be a part of Geet's life.

1892
01:31:05,763 --> 01:31:08,347
Mamma, I am leaving.
I'm coming, Geet.

1893
01:31:09,029 --> 01:31:09,830
Okay, bye.

1894
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:10,869
Bye.
See you.

1895
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:12,391
Whose bag is that?

1896
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,059
Your papa's.

1897
01:31:13,258 --> 01:31:14,065
He is going with you.

1898
01:31:14,209 --> 01:31:16,436
Come on, mamma, doesn't he trust me?

1899
01:31:16,674 --> 01:31:18,624
I am going to
attend my friend's wedding.

1900
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:19,202
I know.

1901
01:31:19,203 --> 01:31:21,660
And what will they think.
Their fathers aren't tagging along.

1902
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:24,330
This is not fair. Geet, I am not
going with you without a reason.

1903
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:28,253
Ria's uncle had come
to our shop to invite me.

1904
01:31:28,434 --> 01:31:29,876
He said to come with
the whole family..

1905
01:31:29,877 --> 01:31:31,375
...otherwise he won't
enjoy the wedding.

1906
01:31:31,376 --> 01:31:33,362
We are anyway not going
to enjoy it now, papa.

1907
01:31:33,565 --> 01:31:35,101
Mamma isn't coming, so why are you?

1908
01:31:35,369 --> 01:31:36,946
I don't know why she isn't coming.

1909
01:31:36,947 --> 01:31:38,347
I need to mediate on Prabhu's name.

1910
01:31:39,357 --> 01:31:40,470
Mamma, you know, right?

1911
01:31:41,898 --> 01:31:44,151
She has never been to
any wedding other than her own.

1912
01:31:44,267 --> 01:31:45,622
She wouldn't have attended that
either if I wasn't there. Mother.

1913
01:31:45,623 --> 01:31:47,160
He's so dramatic.
I won't go with him.

1914
01:31:47,161 --> 01:31:47,824
Don't say that.

1915
01:31:47,825 --> 01:31:49,113
Mamma, who does this?

1916
01:31:49,114 --> 01:31:50,996
Smile and leave, my child.

1917
01:31:51,342 --> 01:31:52,394
Mamma loves you.

1918
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:54,939
Yeah.

1919
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:06,279
"Back off!"

1920
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:09,458
"Back off, uncle!"

1921
01:32:11,656 --> 01:32:13,077
"Back off!"

1922
01:32:13,388 --> 01:32:14,886
"Back off, uncle!"

1923
01:32:15,068 --> 01:32:18,415
"Back off, uncle!"

1924
01:32:18,416 --> 01:32:22,255
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1925
01:32:25,021 --> 01:32:26,480
"I am high.."

1926
01:32:26,781 --> 01:32:28,277
"I am high.."

1927
01:32:28,397 --> 01:32:31,894
"I am high and ready to fly."

1928
01:32:31,895 --> 01:32:35,005
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1929
01:32:35,142 --> 01:32:38,652
"I have no control
over myself today."

1930
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:41,725
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1931
01:32:41,832 --> 01:32:44,942
"I will get drunk and dance."

1932
01:32:45,181 --> 01:32:49,458
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1933
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:05,979
"You can invite Shakira."

1934
01:33:09,335 --> 01:33:12,714
"You can make us compete."

1935
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:19,634
"You can invite Shakira."

1936
01:33:19,635 --> 01:33:22,277
"You can make us compete."

1937
01:33:22,278 --> 01:33:23,888
"My moves.."

1938
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:25,615
"My moves.."

1939
01:33:25,616 --> 01:33:29,074
"My moves have a lot to say today."

1940
01:33:29,075 --> 01:33:32,531
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1941
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:38,981
"I am high and ready to fly."

1942
01:33:38,982 --> 01:33:42,440
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1943
01:33:42,441 --> 01:33:45,782
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1944
01:33:45,783 --> 01:33:49,284
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1945
01:33:49,489 --> 01:33:50,910
"Back off!"

1946
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,048
"Back off, uncle!"

1947
01:34:02,994 --> 01:34:06,450
"I won't let the music stop."

1948
01:34:09,354 --> 01:34:13,271
"I won't sleep,
I won't let anyone sleep."

1949
01:34:16,353 --> 01:34:19,934
"I won't let the music stop."

1950
01:34:20,045 --> 01:34:22,718
"I won't sleep,
I won't let anyone sleep."

1951
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:24,370
"I will cause a commotion.."

1952
01:34:24,506 --> 01:34:26,100
"I will cause a commotion.."

1953
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:29,432
"I will cause a commotion
using my emotions."

1954
01:34:29,543 --> 01:34:33,036
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1955
01:34:36,188 --> 01:34:39,759
"I am high and ready to fly."

1956
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,042
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1957
01:34:43,043 --> 01:34:46,271
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1958
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:52,146
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1959
01:34:54,038 --> 01:34:55,038
Veer?

1960
01:34:56,772 --> 01:34:58,244
What are you doing here?

1961
01:34:59,137 --> 01:35:01,016
Papa too is here.
You will get beaten up.

1962
01:35:01,386 --> 01:35:02,386
Go away.

1963
01:35:02,723 --> 01:35:04,401
Why should I fear when you are near?

1964
01:35:04,682 --> 01:35:05,796
Getting cheesy?

1965
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:07,940
You will get beaten
up if papa hears that.

1966
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:09,851
Veer, papa.

1967
01:35:13,129 --> 01:35:14,512
Don't you have any shame?

1968
01:35:16,225 --> 01:35:18,371
How can you stoop so low?

1969
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,497
Sir..
You are a goon.

1970
01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:21,498
Papa!

1971
01:35:22,338 --> 01:35:23,860
But even goons have a character.

1972
01:35:23,861 --> 01:35:25,341
You don't even have
a good character.

1973
01:35:26,325 --> 01:35:28,067
I am feeling very angry but..

1974
01:35:28,543 --> 01:35:30,762
...since someone's happiness
and honor are at stake..

1975
01:35:30,763 --> 01:35:32,211
...I have kept a check on myself.

1976
01:35:33,673 --> 01:35:34,328
Let's go, dear.

1977
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:36,288
Papa, please.
You won't say a word, Geet.

1978
01:35:37,691 --> 01:35:39,918
You saw what the boy
of your choice can do, right?

1979
01:35:40,178 --> 01:35:41,906
Now you will do as I say.

1980
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:44,603
I have finalized a
very nice boy for you.

1981
01:35:45,602 --> 01:35:47,944
And I know that you
will be very happy with him.

1982
01:35:48,472 --> 01:35:49,472
Papa!

1983
01:35:49,946 --> 01:35:50,946
Let's go.

1984
01:36:05,263 --> 01:36:06,530
Call up my uncle.

1985
01:36:06,796 --> 01:36:08,116
I need to give him the good news.

1986
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:10,502
'He's an uncle from Haryana,
a philanderer.'

1987
01:36:10,685 --> 01:36:12,950
'He loves English and Englishwomen.'

1988
01:36:13,072 --> 01:36:14,877
'He couldn't learn English.'

1989
01:36:15,093 --> 01:36:17,857
'But he has thought the Englishwomen
how to speak Haryanvi.'

1990
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:21,006
'Balli knows him quite well.'

1991
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:23,440
'After all, he had sold him a car.'

1992
01:36:23,548 --> 01:36:24,548
I too will go with you.

1993
01:36:24,885 --> 01:36:26,669
What will an old hag
like you do there.

1994
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:27,744
What will you do there?

1995
01:36:27,872 --> 01:36:29,331
Young girls will go there.

1996
01:36:29,531 --> 01:36:30,744
Hot chicks.

1997
01:36:30,955 --> 01:36:31,894
Me too.

1998
01:36:31,895 --> 01:36:32,895
Me too.

1999
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,364
Yes, nephew?

2000
01:36:37,365 --> 01:36:39,608
Uncle, your nephew is
getting married. Married?

2001
01:36:39,609 --> 01:36:40,795
Yes.

2002
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:43,583
I think you have finally
ready to bite the apple.

2003
01:36:43,584 --> 01:36:46,494
Do attend my wedding, uncle.

2004
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,335
Of course, I will.

2005
01:36:48,336 --> 01:36:50,428
My marriage will be
no fun without me.

2006
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:52,596
True. Who will do all the rituals?

2007
01:36:52,845 --> 01:36:54,304
Don't worry.

2008
01:36:54,988 --> 01:36:57,677
I will come there as soon
I am done with my honeymoon.

2009
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:59,238
I will surely be there.
Okay, uncle.

2010
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:01,893
He is getting married instead
of concentrating on the business.

2011
01:37:04,101 --> 01:37:06,750
Uncle has four wives
to entertain him.

2012
01:37:07,301 --> 01:37:09,758
And I have not even been
able to get engaged even once.

2013
01:37:10,358 --> 01:37:12,893
We get work according to our status.

2014
01:37:13,192 --> 01:37:14,916
I stay in heaven
along with the angels.

2015
01:37:15,419 --> 01:37:17,224
But I am sweeping floors there.

2016
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:21,225
He has given me a gun
and made me a cleaner.

2017
01:37:21,226 --> 01:37:23,183
Uncle, your car is ready.

2018
01:37:23,184 --> 01:37:25,296
Let's go if you are done here.

2019
01:37:37,217 --> 01:37:39,367
Veer! Veer! Veer!

2020
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:40,877
How are you?

2021
01:37:40,878 --> 01:37:42,529
Did you like the design of the card?

2022
01:37:43,106 --> 01:37:44,642
I am sure you must have the name.

2023
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,061
I am sure you are well educated.

2024
01:37:48,757 --> 01:37:53,941
So the thing is, I want you
to engrave something in your mind.

2025
01:37:54,504 --> 01:37:57,076
Geet is my fiancée.

2026
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:00,631
If I see you anywhere
close to her henceforth..

2027
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,820
...then no one will
be able see you anymore.

2028
01:38:04,302 --> 01:38:07,797
The thing is, you still quite young.

2029
01:38:08,296 --> 01:38:09,666
You have a long life ahead of you.

2030
01:38:39,783 --> 01:38:40,783
Hey!
Veer!

2031
01:38:41,075 --> 01:38:42,084
How dare you come here!

2032
01:38:42,085 --> 01:38:42,738
Security!

2033
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:44,157
Who let him in?

2034
01:38:44,304 --> 01:38:45,827
Sometimes it's the elder
one and sometimes it's the younger.

2035
01:38:45,828 --> 01:38:46,932
Gopi.. Gopi!
Come on, leave!

2036
01:38:46,933 --> 01:38:48,165
Get out! Leave!
Gopi!

2037
01:38:48,347 --> 01:38:49,229
Calm down.

2038
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:50,651
At least hear him out.

2039
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:53,532
You can listen to this goon.
I won't.

2040
01:38:55,648 --> 01:38:56,838
Sorry, Veer.

2041
01:39:02,592 --> 01:39:05,237
Sir, you invited me
a lot at that wedding.

2042
01:39:06,251 --> 01:39:08,051
I could have answered
you back if I wanted to.

2043
01:39:09,108 --> 01:39:13,255
But I too was aware that we were
there celebrating someone's joy..

2044
01:39:14,045 --> 01:39:15,812
Someone's honor was at stake.

2045
01:39:19,345 --> 01:39:21,342
I tolerated all your questions.

2046
01:39:22,655 --> 01:39:25,188
And a single reply from
me could have been enough for you.

2047
01:39:29,045 --> 01:39:30,313
May I say something, sir?

2048
01:39:31,863 --> 01:39:34,970
I can kidnap Geet whenever I want.

2049
01:39:37,646 --> 01:39:38,837
But I won't do that.

2050
01:39:39,549 --> 01:39:41,321
Because both of us don't want that.

2051
01:39:42,131 --> 01:39:45,203
Because if a father doesn't
give his daughter away happily..

2052
01:39:45,873 --> 01:39:47,753
...then that relationship
holds no value for us.

2053
01:39:50,472 --> 01:39:52,192
Geet and I won't get
married to each other..

2054
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:55,165
...till we don't
have your permission.

2055
01:40:00,964 --> 01:40:03,000
One more thing, sir.

2056
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,516
That day,
I didn't go there because of Geet.

2057
01:40:07,398 --> 01:40:09,165
It was my friend's
brother's wedding.

2058
01:40:10,326 --> 01:40:12,376
I didn't even know
that Geet could be there.

2059
01:40:12,784 --> 01:40:15,011
I too have a character.
I don't show up just anywhere.

2060
01:40:18,535 --> 01:40:19,764
It's from your shop.

2061
01:40:37,535 --> 01:40:38,293
Come, sir.

2062
01:40:38,294 --> 01:40:39,677
These are our horses, sir.

2063
01:40:40,229 --> 01:40:41,419
As white as snow.

2064
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:43,305
All of them are of a good
breed, sir.

2065
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:46,672
You won't find a
single spot on them.

2066
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:49,093
We have around 50 such
horses in our farmhouse.

2067
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:54,071
You won't get such
horses anywhere else.

2068
01:40:55,605 --> 01:41:00,009
Mr. Vinod, not every horse
can handle me on its back.

2069
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:01,281
Okay.
Got it?

2070
01:41:01,425 --> 01:41:02,040
Yes.

2071
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:05,136
So, you do one thing..
Get me a horse from Peshawar.

2072
01:41:05,575 --> 01:41:06,524
Okay.
Where will you get it from?

2073
01:41:06,525 --> 01:41:07,525
Peshawar.

2074
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:24,635
"Who is this in front of me?"

2075
01:41:25,903 --> 01:41:27,400
"My heart skipped a beat."

2076
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:29,664
This is great, Veer.

2077
01:41:30,272 --> 01:41:31,885
You too have come to book a horse?

2078
01:41:33,184 --> 01:41:34,605
Tell me something..

2079
01:41:35,126 --> 01:41:37,430
What will you do with the horse?

2080
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,001
You will tour the city on it?

2081
01:41:41,461 --> 01:41:43,581
You know, people will think
you are crazy and hit you?

2082
01:41:45,426 --> 01:41:48,095
I am taking a horse from
Peshawar to Bhalla's house.

2083
01:41:49,159 --> 01:41:51,134
What will you do, mister?

2084
01:41:58,881 --> 01:42:02,452
You shouldn't laugh on
a bad joke and mislead people.

2085
01:42:07,008 --> 01:42:10,464
Mr. Groom, you will also
need guests at the wedding.

2086
01:42:11,157 --> 01:42:13,422
Teach them some manners.

2087
01:42:14,032 --> 01:42:17,009
Otherwise, there'll be just cripples
accompanying you at the wedding.

2088
01:42:45,264 --> 01:42:46,530
Do you know who I am?

2089
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:49,390
Why are you hitting me?
I have not done anything.

2090
01:42:50,717 --> 01:42:52,296
Juhi, you saw that?

2091
01:42:52,694 --> 01:42:57,475
These animals who look like humans are
spreading violence on the streets.

2092
01:42:57,476 --> 01:42:58,072
Why are you hitting me?

2093
01:42:58,073 --> 01:42:59,631
Can you see how he is hitting him?

2094
01:42:59,813 --> 01:43:01,030
He will hit him even more.

2095
01:43:01,732 --> 01:43:03,384
And he might also kill him.

2096
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,510
Do you know why?

2097
01:43:04,806 --> 01:43:06,611
Because none of them is Veer.

2098
01:43:07,266 --> 01:43:09,789
It is necessary that
every crowd have a Veer..

2099
01:43:10,453 --> 01:43:14,475
...to protect our
girls and the weak.

2100
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:25,795
So we got all the permits.

2101
01:43:25,796 --> 01:43:26,796
Yes sir.

2102
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:32,384
Upload all the files by tomorrow.
Sure, sir.

2103
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:34,719
Just make sure that you copy that.

2104
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,963
Hey you idiot!

2105
01:43:37,485 --> 01:43:38,560
Uncle!

2106
01:43:38,821 --> 01:43:39,821
That's great!

2107
01:43:40,571 --> 01:43:42,213
Bhurra!
Bhurra!

2108
01:43:42,214 --> 01:43:43,845
Put him down.

2109
01:43:46,786 --> 01:43:48,146
Get the marbles out of your mouth.

2110
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:50,197
Father!

2111
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:52,878
What do you want to be?

2112
01:43:53,089 --> 01:43:53,958
What do you want to be?

2113
01:43:53,959 --> 01:43:54,999
What are you trying to do?

2114
01:43:55,126 --> 01:43:56,224
What are you trying to do?

2115
01:43:56,225 --> 01:43:57,225
Shut up!

2116
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:58,399
Father!

2117
01:44:00,134 --> 01:44:01,463
It has been three months..

2118
01:44:01,623 --> 01:44:04,132
...hence I heard about
any crime committed by you.

2119
01:44:04,133 --> 01:44:05,670
You didn't steal anything.

2120
01:44:05,671 --> 01:44:06,939
You didn't do any bank robbery.

2121
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:08,369
You didn't kidnap anyone.

2122
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:09,926
And now you are getting married.

2123
01:44:09,927 --> 01:44:12,377
You have also shattered
your mother's dream.

2124
01:44:12,755 --> 01:44:15,103
She wanted you to be
greater than Dawood.

2125
01:44:15,307 --> 01:44:16,330
There should be
reward over your head.

2126
01:44:16,331 --> 01:44:17,727
You should be wanted
across the world.

2127
01:44:17,728 --> 01:44:19,687
And you want to get married, stupid.

2128
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,840
Are you done, uncle?

2129
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:22,927
Now listen to your nephew.

2130
01:44:22,928 --> 01:44:23,928
Come on.

2131
01:44:24,149 --> 01:44:25,515
Come on, uncle.
Don't get angry.

2132
01:44:25,516 --> 01:44:26,516
Come with me.

2133
01:44:27,786 --> 01:44:29,681
Don't you trust your nephew?

2134
01:44:29,945 --> 01:44:31,019
Huh, uncle?

2135
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,479
You are my uncle.

2136
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:35,275
Mother's brother is
like another mother.

2137
01:44:36,012 --> 01:44:38,585
This marriage, it is nothing.

2138
01:44:39,084 --> 01:44:40,084
Then what is it?

2139
01:44:43,316 --> 01:44:46,608
It involve 70 acres of land, uncle.

2140
01:44:46,609 --> 01:44:47,300
How many?

2141
01:44:47,486 --> 01:44:48,782
70 acres!
70 acres?

2142
01:44:48,783 --> 01:44:49,783
Yes.

2143
01:44:50,298 --> 01:44:52,296
Our project Jagdamba City..

2144
01:44:52,985 --> 01:44:55,097
This piece of land lies
somewhere in the middle.

2145
01:44:55,602 --> 01:44:57,099
Bhalla wasn't handing it over.

2146
01:44:58,048 --> 01:45:01,163
'Sir, how many times
have I told you..'

2147
01:45:01,164 --> 01:45:04,198
'..that forget 70 acres,
I'm not even ready..

2148
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:06,267
...to sell even a
small piece of land.'

2149
01:45:07,621 --> 01:45:08,920
But now he will
happily give it away.

2150
01:45:08,921 --> 01:45:09,652
How?

2151
01:45:09,653 --> 01:45:12,133
As dowry, along with his daughter.

2152
01:45:12,134 --> 01:45:12,858
Along with his daughter!

2153
01:45:12,859 --> 01:45:13,934
The truth?

2154
01:45:13,935 --> 01:45:16,517
I never lie, uncle.
I swear.

2155
01:45:17,192 --> 01:45:18,798
That's my boy!

2156
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:21,439
Bhurra! Bhurra!

2157
01:45:22,092 --> 01:45:23,361
Quiet.
We will get the girl and the land.

2158
01:45:23,362 --> 01:45:25,256
Don't act crazy.
We will get the girl and the land.

2159
01:45:25,257 --> 01:45:28,478
We will get the girl and the land.

2160
01:45:28,584 --> 01:45:32,368
We will get the girl and the land.

2161
01:45:32,369 --> 01:45:33,753
We will get the girl and the land.

2162
01:45:33,754 --> 01:45:35,731
Father, but whose?

2163
01:45:35,732 --> 01:45:36,708
Bhalla's!

2164
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:40,051
Bhalla's daughter, Bhalla's land!

2165
01:45:40,052 --> 01:45:42,610
Bhalla's daughter, Bhalla's land!

2166
01:45:42,611 --> 01:45:44,171
Bhalla! Bhalla! Bhalla!

2167
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:47,705
Bhalla's daughter, Bhalla's land!

2168
01:45:47,928 --> 01:45:51,119
I am Bhalla! I am Bhalla!

2169
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:55,181
I am Bhalla! I am Bhalla!

2170
01:45:55,306 --> 01:45:56,766
I am Bhalla!

2171
01:45:57,013 --> 01:45:58,814
Father, Bhalla!

2172
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:01,531
Yes.

2173
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:03,478
Gopichand Bhalla.

2174
01:46:04,716 --> 01:46:06,242
Brother,
today you have made the slogan..

2175
01:46:06,243 --> 01:46:12,298
...educate the daughter, save
the daughter meaning in my life.

2176
01:46:12,487 --> 01:46:14,983
Look, I educated my daughter.

2177
01:46:15,813 --> 01:46:16,970
And you saved her.

2178
01:46:18,485 --> 01:46:22,529
Bhalla's daughter, Bhalla's land!

2179
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:24,489
Bhalla! Bhalla! Bhalla!

2180
01:46:25,953 --> 01:46:26,953
Goodbye!

2181
01:46:37,523 --> 01:46:38,666
How are you, Mr. Bhalla!

2182
01:46:39,603 --> 01:46:40,603
Thank you.

2183
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:42,810
Thank you?

2184
01:46:43,001 --> 01:46:46,265
You cleared all my doubts.

2185
01:46:47,422 --> 01:46:48,759
I was in a dilemma.

2186
01:46:49,529 --> 01:46:51,065
You have cleared all my doubts.

2187
01:46:51,593 --> 01:46:56,491
Now, don't even think about
getting married to my daughter.

2188
01:46:59,988 --> 01:47:01,679
You won't get married to her.

2189
01:47:02,537 --> 01:47:04,535
Mr. Bhalla,
don't start with this now.

2190
01:47:05,964 --> 01:47:09,291
I am a simple guy,
but I am not prone to shocks either.

2191
01:47:10,111 --> 01:47:12,775
The thing is, everyone
knows that I am getting married.

2192
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:14,752
Only the horse needs
to be decorated.

2193
01:47:14,986 --> 01:47:16,006
If my honor..

2194
01:47:16,007 --> 01:47:20,539
It's not your honor, but my
daughter's life at stake here.

2195
01:47:21,183 --> 01:47:23,377
Anyone who tries to
take her happiness away..

2196
01:47:23,826 --> 01:47:25,401
Son, I am confectioner.

2197
01:47:26,576 --> 01:47:27,843
I make sweets.

2198
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:31,103
But that doesn't mean
I say only sweet things.

2199
01:47:32,211 --> 01:47:37,664
I also know how to start
a fire and fry and roast things.

2200
01:47:38,694 --> 01:47:39,694
Got it?

2201
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:42,791
Goodbye.

2202
01:47:47,915 --> 01:47:54,236
Bhalla, you think you have
a feast after spoiling my meal?

2203
01:47:55,416 --> 01:47:57,798
All hail the Goddess, Bhalla!

2204
01:47:58,265 --> 01:47:59,839
Don't worry, nephew.

2205
01:48:00,147 --> 01:48:01,760
Your uncle is still here.

2206
01:48:01,896 --> 01:48:03,855
You prepare to get married.

2207
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,564
Things will go as your
uncle wants them to go.

2208
01:48:06,756 --> 01:48:10,050
Anyone who interferes
will be done for.

2209
01:48:11,304 --> 01:48:12,306
Sorry, brother.

2210
01:48:13,866 --> 01:48:19,041
I had painted a very
bad image of Veer in my mind.

2211
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,987
He is a very nice boy.

2212
01:48:22,715 --> 01:48:23,790
I am bad.

2213
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:26,186
Born in '56.

2214
01:48:28,129 --> 01:48:31,509
My old school thoughts
and stubbornness..

2215
01:48:32,171 --> 01:48:36,720
...didn't understand her heart,
her love or her understanding.

2216
01:48:37,852 --> 01:48:39,957
I am a very bad father.

2217
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:41,009
Third-class.

2218
01:48:42,132 --> 01:48:44,896
But now I want to
become first-class.

2219
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:51,087
Hence, I request you to
please get Veerey married to Geet.

2220
01:48:51,393 --> 01:48:52,393
Accept her.

2221
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,298
I have been feeling
burdened since last night.

2222
01:48:57,177 --> 01:48:58,751
I couldn't even sleep.

2223
01:49:00,747 --> 01:49:03,819
Mr. Bhalla,
you should unburden yourself.

2224
01:49:04,235 --> 01:49:05,794
I too have done so.

2225
01:49:06,724 --> 01:49:10,189
Today, I realized that
my Veer is a very nice boy.

2226
01:49:15,163 --> 01:49:16,776
Thank you. Thank you.

2227
01:49:17,843 --> 01:49:21,929
"Everyone is happy,
today's Veerey's wedding."

2228
01:49:24,974 --> 01:49:29,103
"Dance, dude.. Today's
Veerey's wedding."

2229
01:49:32,236 --> 01:49:33,913
"Everyone is happy."
Everything good?

2230
01:49:33,914 --> 01:49:35,741
"Today's Veerey's wedding."

2231
01:49:35,742 --> 01:49:37,007
"Veerey's wedding.."

2232
01:49:37,008 --> 01:49:37,739
Mother.

2233
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,312
"Veerey's wedding.."

2234
01:49:39,523 --> 01:49:42,539
"Veerey's wedding.."

2235
01:49:51,117 --> 01:49:52,117
Bhalla!

2236
01:49:52,553 --> 01:49:54,232
Today I will make you a belle!

2237
01:50:00,801 --> 01:50:01,808
Bhurra!

2238
01:50:01,809 --> 01:50:03,040
Go and get Geet.

2239
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:04,994
I'll get her, father.

2240
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:06,483
Why don't you just kill me?

2241
01:50:06,603 --> 01:50:08,150
I'll get you your wife, bro.

2242
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:14,432
Geet! Geet! Geet!

2243
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:18,027
Help!
Who are you?

2244
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:19,028
Father!

2245
01:50:19,248 --> 01:50:20,900
Hey beardy goon, who are you?
What is it?

2246
01:50:20,901 --> 01:50:22,127
Father!
Get me down!

2247
01:50:22,128 --> 01:50:24,240
Father, I have brought Geet!
Get me down!

2248
01:50:27,021 --> 01:50:28,384
Geet!
I am not Geet!

2249
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:31,552
You idiot, she isn't Geet!

2250
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:33,978
Slap him!

2251
01:50:35,024 --> 01:50:36,253
Father, I'll go and get Geet.

2252
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:46,583
Uncle, why do you go close to yogurt
when you know you're allergic to it?

2253
01:50:46,584 --> 01:50:49,539
Nephew, I didn't go close to it.
It came to me.

2254
01:50:50,858 --> 01:50:53,236
Okay, so it can walk?
Geet! Geet!

2255
01:50:55,923 --> 01:50:57,681
She is looking so beautiful.

2256
01:50:58,118 --> 01:50:59,308
Just like an angel.

2257
01:50:59,461 --> 01:51:01,173
I don't feel like disturbing her.

2258
01:51:02,019 --> 01:51:03,019
I'm getting a phone call.

2259
01:51:03,601 --> 01:51:06,654
Oh great, it's brother-in-law!
Shut up.

2260
01:51:07,626 --> 01:51:08,163
Hello?

2261
01:51:08,432 --> 01:51:09,432
What are you doing, Geet?

2262
01:51:09,624 --> 01:51:10,787
Getting henna applied.

2263
01:51:10,788 --> 01:51:11,211
Great.

2264
01:51:11,466 --> 01:51:12,759
Can we meet?
Now?

2265
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:13,808
Yes.

2266
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,229
Are you close?
Very.

2267
01:51:16,304 --> 01:51:17,431
Come over.
Okay.

2268
01:51:17,697 --> 01:51:18,802
Come over.

2269
01:51:18,803 --> 01:51:20,211
Count till ten and I will be there.

2270
01:51:20,212 --> 01:51:21,902
Should I?
Come over.

2271
01:51:22,109 --> 01:51:24,056
Come over, Mr. Groom.

2272
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:28,223
Because this groom
is already with his bride.

2273
01:51:28,592 --> 01:51:32,642
The thing is, if she agree,
then we will get married..

2274
01:51:32,985 --> 01:51:35,481
...and if she doesn't
then I will kidnap her.

2275
01:51:35,925 --> 01:51:40,384
Now let's see whether
I kidnap her or you save her.

2276
01:51:44,113 --> 01:51:46,533
How do girls run wearing
such heavy dresses?

2277
01:51:47,677 --> 01:51:49,416
Catch your sister-in-law!

2278
01:51:49,827 --> 01:51:51,144
Geet!

2279
01:51:53,474 --> 01:51:55,586
Hello. Hello, police?

2280
01:51:55,817 --> 01:52:00,714
Don't run! Your dress will get
ruined. You will fall into the pool!

2281
01:52:02,063 --> 01:52:05,382
Be careful. Don't hurt her.

2282
01:52:24,659 --> 01:52:25,714
What happened, son?

2283
01:52:25,715 --> 01:52:26,895
Why did you stop?

2284
01:52:28,211 --> 01:52:29,211
Veer?

2285
01:52:29,578 --> 01:52:30,578
You are here?

2286
01:52:30,969 --> 01:52:32,879
Look, Veer is here now.

2287
01:52:34,356 --> 01:52:36,470
Son, we had called the police,
but you showed up.

2288
01:52:36,471 --> 01:52:37,471
God bless you.

2289
01:52:37,618 --> 01:52:38,949
You have come at the right time.

2290
01:52:39,663 --> 01:52:40,699
Come on son, go for it.

2291
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:41,990
Violence?

2292
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:43,266
No, no, no!

2293
01:52:43,267 --> 01:52:44,799
I don't raise my hand on anyone.

2294
01:52:45,146 --> 01:52:46,605
Okay, okay, okay.

2295
01:52:46,728 --> 01:52:47,987
Then what's this?

2296
01:52:47,988 --> 01:52:49,738
This? Broke it with my leg.

2297
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:51,450
Okay.
Get him.

2298
01:52:51,451 --> 01:52:53,377
Do you want me to Whatsapp
you the instructions? Get him!

2299
01:52:53,378 --> 01:52:54,378
Hey!
Veer!

2300
01:52:55,146 --> 01:52:56,146
Papa!

2301
01:53:02,173 --> 01:53:04,980
"Your beloved is here."

2302
01:53:05,467 --> 01:53:07,041
"And my bride is scared?"

2303
01:53:08,098 --> 01:53:11,439
Father-in-law, you should
prepare for our wedding.

2304
01:53:11,581 --> 01:53:14,435
Because now your daughter is mine.

2305
01:53:14,436 --> 01:53:15,436
Right?

2306
01:53:16,002 --> 01:53:17,918
She hit me!
Get her, brother!

2307
01:53:18,073 --> 01:53:19,073
Stop!

2308
01:53:30,168 --> 01:53:31,168
Run!

2309
01:53:40,539 --> 01:53:41,781
Well done, Veer.

2310
01:53:46,325 --> 01:53:47,867
Elephant!
Move away!

2311
01:53:48,829 --> 01:53:50,672
Go away!

2312
01:53:56,726 --> 01:53:57,490
Uncle!

2313
01:53:57,699 --> 01:54:00,579
Your nephew is getting
beaten up over there.

2314
01:54:00,679 --> 01:54:01,679
Where are you going?

2315
01:54:01,783 --> 01:54:03,031
You too will get thrashed.

2316
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:05,071
Listen, you like Dahi Bhalla, right?

2317
01:54:05,072 --> 01:54:06,378
So I got some for you.

2318
01:54:06,577 --> 01:54:09,688
Uncle, try some Dahi
Bhalla made by the Bhallas.

2319
01:54:10,563 --> 01:54:12,138
Just eat the dumpling in it.

2320
01:54:12,974 --> 01:54:14,867
Then just eat the yogurt.

2321
01:54:17,051 --> 01:54:19,469
Strange. He likes neither
yogurt nor the dumpling.

2322
01:54:19,685 --> 01:54:20,685
This is great!

2323
01:54:24,096 --> 01:54:25,096
Balli bro?

2324
01:54:25,254 --> 01:54:26,254
Veerey?

2325
01:54:48,049 --> 01:54:49,700
Geet! Geet! Geet!

2326
01:54:52,425 --> 01:54:53,425
Father!

2327
01:54:53,901 --> 01:54:55,433
My marbles!

2328
01:54:58,499 --> 01:54:59,499
Uncle?

2329
01:55:00,138 --> 01:55:01,542
Hello!

2330
01:55:03,258 --> 01:55:04,292
What's wrong?

2331
01:55:06,258 --> 01:55:08,754
Come here.
What is it? What's wrong?

2332
01:55:09,853 --> 01:55:10,925
Why are you sneezing?

2333
01:55:18,137 --> 01:55:21,870
Come on, man.
Who is sending the location to you?

2334
01:55:21,871 --> 01:55:22,928
You show up from thin air!

2335
01:55:22,929 --> 01:55:23,986
You!

2336
01:55:38,491 --> 01:55:39,683
Who did put your nose into?

2337
01:55:41,725 --> 01:55:42,725
Wipe it.

2338
01:55:43,107 --> 01:55:43,760
I am feeling better.

2339
01:55:44,043 --> 01:55:45,043
Thank you.

2340
01:55:46,525 --> 01:55:47,869
Calm down, calm down.

2341
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:49,281
I cannot speak.

2342
01:55:49,612 --> 01:55:51,972
You don't need to, uncle.

2343
01:55:52,691 --> 01:55:55,417
Fear is visible on your face.

2344
01:55:56,931 --> 01:55:58,620
And why are you holding this gun?

2345
01:55:58,867 --> 01:56:00,171
Why do you need a gun?

2346
01:56:00,172 --> 01:56:01,884
One look at your face
and one will pee out of fear.

2347
01:56:01,885 --> 01:56:03,575
You should have been in the army.

2348
01:56:03,576 --> 01:56:04,380
Or police.

2349
01:56:04,381 --> 01:56:05,941
You should have fought
for our country.

2350
01:56:06,269 --> 01:56:08,064
You would have defeated our enemy.

2351
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:10,808
And your nephew, what is his name?

2352
01:56:11,524 --> 01:56:12,753
What has he done for you?

2353
01:56:13,112 --> 01:56:14,571
Has he ever sent you anywhere?

2354
01:56:14,733 --> 01:56:16,000
He did.
Where?

2355
01:56:16,417 --> 01:56:17,669
He has sent me to prison, thrice.

2356
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:18,792
Damn him!

2357
01:56:19,219 --> 01:56:21,062
I did so much for him.

2358
01:56:21,347 --> 01:56:22,423
I robbed banks.

2359
01:56:22,424 --> 01:56:23,388
I stole from other people.

2360
01:56:23,389 --> 01:56:24,389
I committed murders.

2361
01:56:24,571 --> 01:56:27,065
I escaped encounters, thrice.
Look at this, a bullet mark.

2362
01:56:27,228 --> 01:56:28,228
Oh no.

2363
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:30,737
All uncles are generous.

2364
01:56:32,274 --> 01:56:34,041
But even the nephew
should be considerate.

2365
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:36,882
I will send you to London.

2366
01:56:37,998 --> 01:56:39,917
Everything there will be fair.

2367
01:56:40,669 --> 01:56:42,168
Fair girls.

2368
01:56:43,434 --> 01:56:44,739
Fair boys.

2369
01:56:45,094 --> 01:56:46,901
Uncle! Come back!

2370
01:56:50,086 --> 01:56:52,158
Come on!
Let go!

2371
01:56:55,254 --> 01:56:56,335
Let me go!

2372
01:56:56,336 --> 01:56:58,064
Father!
Let me go!

2373
01:56:59,269 --> 01:57:01,304
I brought her!
Who have you brought?

2374
01:57:01,482 --> 01:57:02,172
Geet!

2375
01:57:02,173 --> 01:57:03,409
I am not Geet, stupid!

2376
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:04,722
Stop kidnapping girls.

2377
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:13,629
My nephew turned me
into an evil man.

2378
01:57:16,014 --> 01:57:19,089
If not for this love, you would
have been a colonel in the army.

2379
01:57:20,013 --> 01:57:21,013
Enough..

2380
01:57:23,256 --> 01:57:24,906
You have opened my ears.

2381
01:57:26,527 --> 01:57:28,409
At least get the saying
right, uncle.

2382
01:57:28,746 --> 01:57:29,746
Hey!

2383
01:57:29,859 --> 01:57:30,974
You have opened my eyes.

2384
01:57:44,219 --> 01:57:44,795
Uncle!

2385
01:57:45,157 --> 01:57:45,633
Uncle!

2386
01:57:45,634 --> 01:57:46,634
Has he changed for good?

2387
01:57:56,199 --> 01:57:58,853
Hey!
I am warning you, I'll shoot you!

2388
01:57:58,854 --> 01:58:00,118
Where did I get the umbrella from?

2389
01:58:00,119 --> 01:58:01,119
Here it is!

2390
01:58:01,309 --> 01:58:02,946
I have not loaded it
as I was in a hurry.

2391
01:58:02,947 --> 01:58:05,057
But I will hit you with it.
My aim is very good.

2392
01:58:12,408 --> 01:58:14,941
Someone shot me on my bum!

2393
01:58:15,885 --> 01:58:18,611
Call for an ambulance. I will die.

2394
01:58:18,848 --> 01:58:21,611
Come on, get going from here!
Good work, Rani Chaudhary.

2395
01:58:21,914 --> 01:58:23,927
Arrest him!
Take them away!

2396
01:58:23,928 --> 01:58:25,410
They should manage to escape!
Come on, take them away.

2397
01:58:25,411 --> 01:58:29,532
Let's go, scoundrels. I will
get you married in the prison.

2398
01:58:29,533 --> 01:58:30,533
Come on.

2399
01:58:30,999 --> 01:58:31,999
Thank you.

2400
01:58:44,432 --> 01:58:45,432
You...!

2401
01:58:48,234 --> 01:58:48,732
Come on!

2402
01:58:48,733 --> 01:58:49,733
Geet!
Let me go!

2403
01:58:52,219 --> 01:58:54,715
Too much attitude, Rani Chaudhary?

2404
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,521
Two slaps and you got impressed?

2405
01:58:59,308 --> 01:59:01,191
I handle half the
cases of this city.

2406
01:59:01,757 --> 01:59:04,701
Anyway, whether or not it falls
under my area, SP always send me.

2407
01:59:05,175 --> 01:59:07,505
This falls under my area,
that's why I am here.

2408
01:59:07,872 --> 01:59:10,170
I am sure you must be
dying to praise me.

2409
01:59:10,388 --> 01:59:11,548
But I don't have time to waste.

2410
01:59:11,549 --> 01:59:12,549
Hey!

2411
01:59:23,787 --> 01:59:24,623
Save him!

2412
01:59:24,726 --> 01:59:25,726
Veer!

2413
01:59:26,328 --> 01:59:29,016
Don't let go of my hand, I will die!
I am telling the truth, I will fall.

2414
01:59:29,017 --> 01:59:30,434
I am telling the truth.

2415
01:59:30,435 --> 01:59:31,087
Don't let go!

2416
01:59:31,088 --> 01:59:31,884
Uncle!

2417
01:59:31,885 --> 01:59:32,353
Bro.

2418
01:59:32,354 --> 01:59:33,890
Should I let you go?
No, no, no.

2419
01:59:33,891 --> 01:59:34,697
No, please.
Should I?

2420
01:59:34,698 --> 01:59:36,578
Please, don't let go
of my hand at any cost!

2421
01:59:36,579 --> 01:59:38,206
Uncle!
Veer, don't!

2422
01:59:38,207 --> 01:59:39,497
I am telling the truth.

2423
01:59:39,956 --> 01:59:43,325
This is what's called humanity.
This boy is full of it.

2424
01:59:43,514 --> 01:59:45,664
From today,
I stop all my illicit businesses.

2425
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:48,521
I have learned a lesson.
If you fall down..

2426
01:59:48,522 --> 01:59:49,725
If he lets go of your hand..

2427
01:59:49,726 --> 01:59:51,147
Then you will die for sure.

2428
01:59:51,148 --> 01:59:53,439
This boy deserves to be with Geet.

2429
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:54,554
He deserves her!

2430
01:59:55,048 --> 01:59:55,932
Bro! Bro! Bro!

2431
01:59:55,933 --> 01:59:57,562
I am totally getting
what uncle is trying to say.

2432
01:59:57,563 --> 01:59:58,487
I am telling the truth.

2433
01:59:58,488 --> 01:59:59,302
You can have Geet.

2434
01:59:59,427 --> 02:00:01,541
You can have the 70 acres of land
too. You can have Geet's father.

2435
02:00:01,542 --> 02:00:02,674
You can have meet too, bro.

2436
02:00:02,675 --> 02:00:03,611
You should get married, bro.

2437
02:00:03,612 --> 02:00:05,688
I will dance at your wedding.
I swear.

2438
02:00:05,689 --> 02:00:06,689
Please pull me up, bro.

2439
02:00:07,837 --> 02:00:08,837
Look..

2440
02:00:10,141 --> 02:00:12,829
The thing is that I
just got impressed by you.

2441
02:00:14,006 --> 02:00:16,041
So, I am thinking
of taking a chance.

2442
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:19,742
If you try to act
smart then you know that..

2443
02:00:20,709 --> 02:00:21,769
That's enough, Mr. Balli.

2444
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:24,317
How hard are you going
to make me fall for you?

2445
02:00:24,933 --> 02:00:27,413
Rani Chaudhary is
already crazy about you.

2446
02:00:27,414 --> 02:00:29,380
I will dance at your wedding!

2447
02:00:29,381 --> 02:00:30,451
Veer!

2448
02:00:30,452 --> 02:00:33,720
I think you should switch
back to non-violence now.

2449
02:00:33,721 --> 02:00:34,332
Come on.

2450
02:00:34,333 --> 02:00:35,647
Let go of everything.

2451
02:00:35,648 --> 02:00:38,530
Should I let go?
No, don't let go!

2452
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:41,029
No, don't let go!
He will fall!

2453
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:42,990
Pull him up!
Pull him up, bro!

2454
02:00:42,991 --> 02:00:45,371
Don't let go, please!
Pull him up!

2455
02:00:45,658 --> 02:00:46,659
Very good.

2456
02:00:47,403 --> 02:00:48,489
What are your intentions?

2457
02:00:50,132 --> 02:00:51,207
To get married.

2458
02:00:52,796 --> 02:00:53,871
That's your decision?

2459
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:54,579
Yes.

2460
02:00:54,821 --> 02:00:56,620
Is your decision considered
the final decision in your house?

2461
02:00:56,621 --> 02:00:57,120
Yes.

2462
02:00:57,547 --> 02:00:59,087
Do you have any Tillu in your life?

2463
02:00:59,088 --> 02:01:00,088
Yes.
