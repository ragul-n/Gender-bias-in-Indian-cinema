1
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,590
The Kingdom of Punjab stretched

2
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,257
from the British-held India
to the south,

3
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:40,923
from Afghanistan in the west
to Tibet in the east.

4
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:45,923
This mighty kingdom,
led by an astute statesman,

5
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:48,590
Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

6
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,048
Fearsome, fearless and feared,

7
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,340
he was known
as the lion of Punjab.

8
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:55,965
Ranjit Singh's death

9
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:59,257
of power struggle

10
00:00:59,298 --> 00:01:03,798
of his heirs.

11
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:12,007
His youngest son, Duleep Singh, was
crowned at the age of five.

12
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:18,133
The British drove the final
nail into the Sikh kingdom

13
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:22,423
by removing him from his throne
and his mother.

14
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:23,465
They did not kill him.

15
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:28,007
They exiled him
from his people and his land.

16
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:31,341
This is his story.

17
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:39,382
May the winds of your sails
take you across smooth waters

18
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:45,091
and your life henceforth
in the hands of Lord Jesus.

19
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,758
He is
an impressionable young boy.

20
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,590
His studies
in the Christian doctrine

21
00:01:49,632 --> 00:01:51,548
are going splendidly well.

22
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,340
The Maharaja will be one of us.

23
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:56,299
Receive on thy forehead
the sign of the Holy Cross.

24
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,216
Openly profess the faith
of Christ crucified.

25
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:01,798
I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,383
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

27
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:33,758
Do put a little smile
on your face, sir.

28
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,633
That painting is going
in the Grand Room

29
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:38,008
and will be looked at
for hundreds of years.

30
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,591
You wouldn't want people
to think of you

31
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:43,715
as a miserable and unhappy boy.
Hmm?

32
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:45,758
And do get on with it, Franz.

33
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:50,299
Everyone is waiting
for my handsome prince!

34
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:53,799
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:58,091
Dr. Login, I relinquish to you
your responsibility.

36
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,549
In all honesty,
I do hate to let you go.

37
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:03,091
I was rather looking forward
to showing you off.

38
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:08,382
But Dr. Login, I gather,
has some other plans in mind.

39
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:10,132
I am truly indebted to you,
Your Majesty.

40
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:13,008
Don't be such a pushover,
Dr. Login.

41
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,758
Enjoy this enchanting music.
Have a drink.

42
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,841
There's someone
I would like you to meet.

43
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:21,715
Go on, Duleep.

44
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:23,924
I can see
there are many young ladies

45
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,424
eagerly awaiting your company.

46
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:29,924
Come, come. It's not polite
to keep people waiting.

47
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:32,341
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:35,507
Good evening.

49
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:41,133
So... Now, let's see.

50
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:43,799
Surely amongst all these
beautiful young ladies,

51
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:47,924
there's one fit enough
to bear your children, my son.

52
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:54,049
Ah. Now, that is the someone
I want you to meet.

53
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,759
Are you well, sir?

54
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:03,841
Splendid shot, sir.
You have your kill.

55
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,592
Not good enough, Arur.

56
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:08,425
Still only the fourth best
in the country.

57
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,549
With time,
you will be number one, sir.

58
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:16,424
There is much to hunt
in these forests of Britannia.

59
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:57,675
My boy!

60
00:05:57,717 --> 00:05:59,134
My prince!

61
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:02,759
No, do leave that to others,
Duleep.

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,717
Objects break.

63
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,091
In particular,
those that are rather fragile.

64
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,342
Do follow me.

65
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:12,717
And broken, of course,
they are of no value.

66
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:22,092
Such comfort
in the house of our Lord.

67
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:25,509
Do you feel that, Duleep?

68
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,092
Yes?

69
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:31,716
Yes.

70
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,717
Come. Pray with me, Duleep.

71
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,425
What troubles you, Duleep?

72
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:37,635
What bears so heavy
on your heart?

73
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:40,925
Speak.

74
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:44,717
Speak with the will
of your freedom.

75
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,092
Freedom?

76
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:50,093
Yes, you are a free man.
As are we all.

77
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,509
Yes.

78
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:54,925
A royal subject.

79
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:01,175
Yes, but with the immunity
of full freedom

80
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:04,010
to speak your mind.

81
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,175
I have to see my mother.

82
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:12,134
I feel your desire, son.

83
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:15,093
But it may not be well taken

84
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:17,468
by those who have toiled
so painstakingly

85
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,509
to take care of your person
and your every need.

86
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:25,759
What good can it do?

87
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,218
Everything Lady Login and myself
have labored to provide for you,

88
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,385
and that with
such profound love,

89
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:35,759
compassion and understanding
of your every need,

90
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,300
would come to naught.

91
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:40,260
And because of your actions,
you risk losing everything.

92
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,343
Being reduced to living
like a commoner

93
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:43,926
amongst the very people--

94
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:48,342
People? What people?

95
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,343
Lady Login has been
more than a mother to you,

96
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:58,260
and I have given you
the love of a father.

97
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:01,050
As I felt it in my heart.

98
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:04,842
Your mother was not capable
of your care.

99
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:08,010
We all did what we felt
was best for you.

100
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:10,676
But I want to see her.

101
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,843
There is so much that troubles.

102
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,009
I have questions
that remain unanswered.

103
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,550
-I understand--
-Please!

104
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:20,301
Please make this possible.

105
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:25,468
I don't even know where she is.

106
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,217
Help me.

107
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:34,010
Why now, after all these years?

108
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,093
The boy is all grown up.

109
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:40,135
He has questions that we do not
have the answers for.

110
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,468
Where is she?

111
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,593
In Nepal.

112
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:49,801
Old, sick, and I believe
she's losing her sight.

113
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:53,801
So, not much of a danger
anymore.

114
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,593
Her days of rebellion are over.

115
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,385
Let him see his mother.

116
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:05,260
Leave the rest
to our mighty Lord.

117
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:08,968
There's a lion that sleeps
in the heart of that boy.

118
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:15,426
I'm afraid if awakened,
the roar may be unbearable.

119
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:30,510
-I welcome you to India.
-Lord Canning.

120
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:37,260
I receive you with full honors
befitting your status.

121
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:38,636
Thank you.

122
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:39,594
However, I do request

123
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:44,093
that we keep this visit
to its agreed-upon purpose.

124
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:49,051
I am just here to see my mother,
Lord Canning.

125
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:50,010
Thank you.

126
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:51,219
And if there is anything
that I can do

127
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:58,760
to make your visit here as
comfortable as it needs to be,

128
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,093
please do let me know.

129
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:14,885
They seem to be
afraid of something.

130
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:27,385
Please, this way, sir.

131
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:06,344
Duleep?

132
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,802
Yes.

133
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:29,969
In my wait for you,
my eyes have betrayed me.

134
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:37,427
So many tears have been shed.

135
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:42,677
And now I can't
even see you well.

136
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:47,636
The one for whom I have longed,
for so many years...

137
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:54,927
Now you're in front of me and
I can't even see you clearly.

138
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:56,177
They have changed you so much.

139
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:07,011
Not the same royal son who was
stolen from me 14 years ago.

140
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:13,470
I didn't know
I could feel so much pain.

141
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:21,427
I have not only lost a kingdom,
I have lost a son too.

142
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:24,594
Time can be so cruel...

143
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:29,095
and destiny, an inevitable foe.

144
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:36,594
We were kings once,
and we had a kingdom.

145
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:52,970
Tell me about England
and your home.

146
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:55,970
It's cold most of the time.

147
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:59,762
Dim, cloudy weather.

148
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:05,345
Besides summertime, you really
don't see the sun very much.

149
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:06,262
But I have heard

150
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:11,262
that the sun never sets
on the British Empire.

151
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,094
-But it is very beautiful.
-The people?

152
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:18,845
Everybody is really good to me.

153
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:23,095
God-fearing, honest...

154
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:25,803
kind-hearted people.

155
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,511
Kind?

156
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:30,887
Are the people in England
different

157
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:36,345
than the ones
I have come to know?

158
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:41,928
It's not just them.

159
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,512
Some of our own people
turned out to be traitors, too.

160
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,553
Your father, the king,

161
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:55,678
worked hard
to keep them all united.

162
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:04,012
The Lion of Punjab built
the kingdom straw by straw.

163
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:10,428
His pyre hadn't
even simmered down yet...

164
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,595
and members of the Royal Court

165
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:16,095
had already started plotting
to take over the kingdom.

166
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:20,013
The British were waiting
at our borders,

167
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:21,387
watching us like vultures.

168
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:24,928
They had already taken India
in their grip.

169
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,678
Only Punjab was left.

170
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,595
And it was the most valuable
to them.

171
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:31,428
The English knew

172
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,678
they could finally launch
a decisive strike.

173
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:50,512
Tell me about the Queen...
Victoria.

174
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:52,762
Is she beautiful?

175
00:17:54,137 --> 00:17:55,012
She's white.

176
00:17:55,053 --> 00:18:00,013
Yes, obviously she's white,
but...

177
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:02,428
But not beautiful. Am I right?

178
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,553
She says that
I'm very good-looking.

179
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:07,137
Handsome. Charming.

180
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:08,803
And pleasing to the heart.

181
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:12,554
She really admires my eyes
a lot.

182
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:16,137
She calls me "Black Prince."

183
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,887
You're not a prince.
You're a king.

184
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:23,804
She treats me very well.

185
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:27,054
You were born to be a king.

186
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:30,928
And a king you became, my son.

187
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:39,221
Don't you realize
what has taken place?

188
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:47,678
Lahore was awash with blood.

189
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,263
The price was dear.

190
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:56,095
Your father's eldest son,
Kharak Singh,

191
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,553
ascended to the throne.

192
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,804
But his queen, Rani Chand Kaur,
had bigger ambitions.

193
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:08,263
She wanted to make her son,
Nau Nihal, the King of Punjab.

194
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,845
Nau Nihal became our ruler.

195
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:14,096
However, his reign
only lasted a day,

196
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:16,471
as he was crushed
under a falling gate

197
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:20,304
while coming back
from his father's funeral.

198
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:22,721
Now, Rani Chand Kaur
was bathing,

199
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:27,304
when her servants
strangled her to death.

200
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:33,263
Sher Singh,
Maharaja's second son in line,

201
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:34,263
was placed on the throne

202
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:39,638
with theKhalsa'sblessing
and full backing.

203
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:44,429
Don't stop.

204
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:49,429
Sir, are you sure
you want to know?

205
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:53,138
Yes.

206
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,304
Maharaja Sher Singh was
watching wrestling,

207
00:19:57,346 --> 00:20:00,346
something he enjoyed immensely.

208
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:11,763
Who was it?

209
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,929
Ajit Singh Sandhawalia.

210
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:17,264
He declared himself the Vizier,

211
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:21,721
and you... the king.

212
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,388
You did not tell me this before.

213
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,596
I didn't think it mattered.

214
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:32,596
It wouldn't have
changed anything.

215
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:46,763
We are a foolish nation,
the Sikhs.

216
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:51,429
We threw away the most
important gift of the Guru

217
00:20:51,471 --> 00:20:52,179
because of greed.

218
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:58,679
The thing he beckoned us
to do away with, we embraced,

219
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,388
and lost his kingdom.

220
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:21,139
We apologize for bothering you
so early in the morning,

221
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,430
but we need
to talk to you as well.

222
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:27,679
That's alright.
Tell me, what is it?

223
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:31,263
We wish to meet the King.

224
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:44,638
How many of them?

225
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,722
A small battalion.

226
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,597
But many more,
not far from here.

227
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,638
They wish to have counsel
with you.

228
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,429
I wish to meet them too.

229
00:21:54,471 --> 00:22:00,180
Sir, the British
are watching our every move.

230
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:03,139
It could be seen as treason.

231
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:11,805
The English took everything.

232
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,305
All my possessions, one by one.

233
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:18,680
My jewelry, my clothes.

234
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:22,471
My dignity and honor,
all tossed into the dirt.

235
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:27,889
Now I'm going to their country
to live among them.

236
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,929
Do you see the irony in that,
Duleep?

237
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:35,179
Maharani Ji?

238
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,597
The carriage has arrived
and is waiting.

239
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:41,055
It can wait.

240
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:43,722
Until I give the order.

241
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,804
Yes.

242
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:52,930
I'm very tired.

243
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:57,514
I don't have the strength
to fight anymore.

244
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:01,013
Duleep...

245
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,180
Don't become like me.

246
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:09,514
You have the blood
of the Lion of Punjab

247
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,055
running through your veins.

248
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:15,389
Carve your own destiny.

249
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:27,139
Blessed shall be those

250
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:33,055
who praise
the True and Timeless One!

251
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:50,722
They are soldiers
of the Sikh kingdom, Duleep.

252
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:58,389
They need a leader
who can lead them to freedom.

253
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:36,514
-Your Highness.
-Maharani Jindan.

254
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:37,430
Yes, Your Highness.

255
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:40,180
I pray your stay here will be
comfortable and warm

256
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:45,598
as I welcome you
to the shores of England.

257
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:47,515
Yes, Your Highness, it is.

258
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:53,139
-And her health?
-Much better now, Your Highness.

259
00:24:53,597 --> 00:24:56,765
Come, join me for tea.

260
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,431
-She talks a lot.
-She invited us for tea.

261
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:06,805
We've come from so far away
and she is just serving us tea?

262
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:12,681
I have seen these before.

263
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,014
I drank tea
from these cups before.

264
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:21,306
I hope you are enjoying the tea,
Rani Jindan.

265
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:23,181
I am rather fond of it.

266
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:29,139
Looks like these cups
have been stolen from us.

267
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:32,930
She says the tea is good.

268
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:36,473
And familiar too, Your Highness.

269
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:57,097
I must excuse myself.
Do please enjoy the tea.

270
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:12,348
Where did she go?

271
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,556
She didn't even offer us
any food.

272
00:26:15,598 --> 00:26:18,556
We were only invited to tea.

273
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:26,181
I see the medicine I sent you
has done you well, Maharani.

274
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:27,181
The taste of this food

275
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:30,348
is so different from the flavor
of the food in Punjab.

276
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,306
Do you agree, Dr. Login?

277
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:38,848
Despite the fact that these
spices came from our Punjab.

278
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,556
That is how it all began.

279
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:44,640
You came to us for our spices

280
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:48,556
and ended up swallowing
our kingdom.

281
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:50,223
Yes, spices.

282
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:52,890
It must be
because the water is different.

283
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:55,765
It could be the water, Maharani.

284
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:59,848
I am glad you agree with me.

285
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:05,223
If I knew you were such
a caring and honest gentleman,

286
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:10,098
I would not have plotted
to poison you.

287
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:14,015
I did try my best.

288
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,057
Poison?

289
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,723
The thought had crossed my mind.

290
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:28,391
Dr. Login, eat your supper.

291
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:31,973
I have come to terms
with my situation.

292
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,390
It's all in the past.

293
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:36,306
There's nothing to worry about.

294
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:40,140
I've decided not to kill you.

295
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:53,266
Are the spices too hot for you,
Dr. Login?

296
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:10,641
My honorable Queen.

297
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:13,640
Colonel Hurbon?

298
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:17,681
It has been a long time,
memsahib.

299
00:28:18,223 --> 00:28:21,307
Time has its own destiny.

300
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:26,723
Yes. And it has not been
as kind as it seems.

301
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:28,431
But we are warriors.

302
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,141
Are we not, Colonel Hurbon?

303
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,099
Yes, we are.

304
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:39,640
Warriors of Maharaja Ranjit
Singh's Army of theKhalsa.

305
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:42,890
You have served him well.

306
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:46,557
It was my honor,memsahib.

307
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:54,265
The sword?

308
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:55,431
Yes,memsahib.

309
00:28:55,473 --> 00:29:01,807
Given to me
by the Lion of Punjab himself.

310
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,849
I know.

311
00:29:03,891 --> 00:29:06,431
I remember it all very well.

312
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:11,932
And now,
I want you to have this.

313
00:29:22,516 --> 00:29:24,599
I know...

314
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:26,807
There is a yearning
in my soul,

315
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:31,224
telling me to battle on,
to become free.

316
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,640
But I am...

317
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:36,932
The young Maharaja Duleep,
he must fight on.

318
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:41,224
You must instill in him
the will and courage

319
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:43,724
to take back
what is rightfully his.

320
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:48,016
He must know
his purpose in life.

321
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:50,557
Lead his people to freedom.

322
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,099
-Thank you.
-Please,memsahib.

323
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,766
It was not only my duty,

324
00:29:56,807 --> 00:30:01,932
but my fulfilment of my pledge
to my king.

325
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:28,391
He was a great king.

326
00:30:28,474 --> 00:30:30,391
Very wise
and an astute politician.

327
00:30:30,432 --> 00:30:32,641
His faith in his religion
was absolute.

328
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:35,849
Even after
the greatest of victories,

329
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:38,267
he bowed before his faith.

330
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:43,307
He used to say, "There is
nothing higher than faith."

331
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:48,724
He was accountable
only to theKhalsa.

332
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:58,432
The Lion of Punjab's
Sword of Justice.

333
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:01,307
I want you to keep it now.

334
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:05,392
Carry it with great pride
and courage.

335
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:08,932
You are the rightful heir
to the sword.

336
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:11,932
Who am I?

337
00:31:11,974 --> 00:31:16,767
You are the one that
the prophecy speaks about.

338
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,642
The one who will regain freedom
for his people

339
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:25,057
and rule his subjects
fairly and wisely.

340
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:51,682
The cold is
really chilling my bones.

341
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:54,850
It's not like the cold
back in our country.

342
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:57,850
Should I get you
another blanket?

343
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:05,266
Thank God.

344
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,933
The sun decided
to show its face.

345
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:16,016
I can see the warmth
in the reflection of this

346
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:18,182
across your face.

347
00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:20,517
No, leave it.

348
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:26,392
There's nothing more divine
than the warmth of a diamond.

349
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:30,724
There was a diamond once.

350
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:34,058
The diamond of the king.

351
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,100
Yes, Duleep. You.

352
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:43,724
You had wealth, personal wealth.

353
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:47,558
Land grants, salt mines

354
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,725
and one special diamond.

355
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:56,182
The diamond?

356
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,225
The Mountain of Light. Kohinoor.

357
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:19,350
-A gift.
-Gift?

358
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:22,434
Your gift.

359
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,808
"Mountain of Light,"
the diamond.

360
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:32,808
Cold. Cold by nature,
I'm afraid.

361
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,059
Diamonds are.

362
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:41,975
It was stolen.
Stolen from you, Duleep.

363
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:45,392
Your kingdom, your wealth.

364
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:46,808
Your dignity.

365
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,517
And in particular, your faith.

366
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:59,433
I am confused, Lord.

367
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:00,893
Help me.

368
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:07,267
For I know not who I am
and where I belong.

369
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,059
God came to us
in the form of Jesus Christ.

370
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:30,975
He lived, died and rose for us

371
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:34,183
so that, through his suffering
and sacrifice,

372
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:37,183
we may attain his favor.

373
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:41,018
I was but a child.

374
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:44,892
I was taken away from her.

375
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:49,017
I did not know
of the ways of the world.

376
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,600
I wanted to learn.

377
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:54,143
But I wanted
to learn everything.

378
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:58,558
Good. Bad. And who I was.

379
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
You were taught
what was right for you.

380
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:04,643
I was taught
what they wanted to teach me.

381
00:35:04,684 --> 00:35:06,726
What was right for them.

382
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:09,934
The Maharani was unable
to care for you.

383
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:15,433
-She was losing her sanity.
-She was my mother.

384
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:18,559
Your safety and wellbeing

385
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:21,518
were of the utmost importance
to the Crown.

386
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:26,392
Lady Login and I cared for you
as our own.

387
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:27,600
Our own flesh and blood.

388
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:32,059
You are part
of who and what I am.

389
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:34,809
-But I am a...
-Christian!

390
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,934
You are a Christian, my son.

391
00:35:36,976 --> 00:35:39,850
And the path of Lord Jesus
Christ is your salvation.

392
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:44,851
My salvation is in knowing
who and what I really am.

393
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,851
Not in what you say I am.

394
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:05,517
I was completely alone.

395
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,768
A woman...

396
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:14,351
surrounded on all four sides
by bloodthirsty vultures.

397
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:17,351
I needed a mother!

398
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:21,643
You managed to lose yourself...

399
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,351
and me as well.

400
00:36:30,643 --> 00:36:33,393
He was the only one
we could trust.

401
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:38,476
Your uncle, Jawahir,
your guardian.

402
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:49,393
You drew your sword against
the blood of the Lion of Punjab!

403
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:55,934
Your face was covered
with his blood.

404
00:36:57,601 --> 00:37:00,559
Sorrow turns people mad.

405
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:27,476
What have they done to you,
Duleep?

406
00:37:27,518 --> 00:37:29,476
They stole you away from me

407
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:32,601
and filled your heart
with absolute lies,

408
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:34,726
lies that you have
come to believe as the truth.

409
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:37,894
They have killed the soul
of the Lion of Punjab.

410
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:42,559
The vultures you talk about
were everywhere.

411
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:47,601
And you abandoned me.
I was but a child.

412
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,769
Not a king.

413
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:54,059
The king was of your making,
not mine.

414
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:58,184
It was your destiny
to become a king.

415
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,268
Maharani?

416
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:33,644
I was told
I would find you here.

417
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,518
You're a man of faith.

418
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:40,769
I don't know anything
of your faith,

419
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,102
and I have no desire to know,

420
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:47,310
but I can only assume
that it holds one

421
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:54,477
to be good,
just and honorable.

422
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:58,560
I think any faith
should do that...

423
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:03,476
if it claims to believe in God.

424
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:08,060
Maharani.
It is very cold outside.

425
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:11,352
It's not good for your health.
Come inside.

426
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:17,810
My health doesn't look any worse
than yours, Dr. Login.

427
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,935
Time.

428
00:39:19,977 --> 00:39:24,144
Time has not been kind to us,
I gather.

429
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:29,143
Good to some...
and a bit worse for others.

430
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,477
Forgive me.

431
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,310
That's not enough.

432
00:39:36,352 --> 00:39:39,102
For the damage
that you have done,

433
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:42,477
no kind of apology will suffice.

434
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:46,477
The pain you have caused
a grieving mother...

435
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:52,394
You stole Duleep from me...
and changed him forever.

436
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:57,394
You squashed his soul
by telling him absolute lies!

437
00:39:57,435 --> 00:40:02,727
I have longed for him
to call me "mother"...

438
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,810
and to hear the Guru's name
from his lips.

439
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:12,394
What have you done to my son?

440
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:16,310
Believe in whatever you wish.

441
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:20,561
But I believe
there is just one God,

442
00:40:20,603 --> 00:40:25,144
whose governance
we all live under.

443
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:27,727
And I can assure you...

444
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:31,977
that you will not be forgiven!

445
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:37,145
Duleep.

446
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:52,228
Don't forget your promise to me.

447
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:55,270
I am to be cremated...

448
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:58,269
as per Sikh rites...

449
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:02,395
on the soil of my birth.

450
00:42:03,978 --> 00:42:04,728
Over there,

451
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,145
Thakur Singh Sandhawalia
is the only one you can trust.

452
00:42:09,186 --> 00:42:12,810
Trust no one else.

453
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:20,603
He was your father's
most trusted ally.

454
00:42:20,645 --> 00:42:26,227
His loyalty is unquestionable.

455
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:35,936
Raise your sword...

456
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:42,728
and reclaim your kingdom.

457
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,145
Do you promise, my son?

458
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:09,770
Yes.

459
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:29,146
The souls of those
that die in Him

460
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:30,479
depart to be with Him,

461
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:36,937
when they behold the face of
God in light and glory,

462
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:43,104
waiting for the full redemption
of their bodies.

463
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:56,937
I will be taking her home.
To Punjab.

464
00:46:56,979 --> 00:47:00,104
She will be cremated
as per Sikh rites.

465
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:03,896
That was my mother's wish.

466
00:47:32,605 --> 00:47:37,229
Sir. You need to come with me.

467
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,396
My son.

468
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:07,187
It's been a good journey.

469
00:48:07,229 --> 00:48:12,272
Now I must enter
the house of my Lord.

470
00:48:14,397 --> 00:48:17,021
Be good to yourself, my son.

471
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:22,813
Be steadfast in everything
that I have taught you.

472
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:37,188
We commend Dr. John Spencer
Login to the mercy of God.

473
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,605
We commit his body to ground.

474
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:46,979
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

475
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:05,897
Now I truly am an orphan.

476
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,772
Respected Mother.

477
00:49:10,688 --> 00:49:16,022
I am going to take you home,
to Punjab.

478
00:49:28,938 --> 00:49:36,980
With a great deal
of trepidation on my part...

479
00:49:37,563 --> 00:49:39,480
But I must.

480
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,688
The circumstances compel me to.

481
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,730
Therefore, I humbly request

482
00:49:46,772 --> 00:49:50,523
that you depart for Britain
immediately.

483
00:49:54,522 --> 00:50:00,938
Your passage into Punjab...
is no longer possible.

484
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,731
You yourself
created the creation.

485
00:50:16,773 --> 00:50:19,688
You yourself infused
your power into it.

486
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,022
You behold your creation,

487
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:25,063
like the losing and winning dice
of the Earth.

488
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,313
Whoever has come, shall depart.

489
00:50:27,355 --> 00:50:30,939
All shall have their turn.

490
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:42,023
I hope you forgive me, Mother.

491
00:50:42,148 --> 00:50:46,647
For I could not take you
to the land of Punjab.

492
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:12,606
Maharaja, we are honored to have you pass
through American Misson School

493
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:14,647
and present these diplomas
to our graduates.

494
00:52:42,523 --> 00:52:45,856
No. Please.

495
00:52:57,189 --> 00:53:00,565
Do you know who I am?

496
00:53:15,314 --> 00:53:20,356
Someone I am clearly not
and can never be.

497
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:31,189
When you are my wife,
you will be who I am.

498
00:54:51,273 --> 00:54:54,565
Can we count? One...

499
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:56,690
Can you count?

500
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:03,814
Shall we count? Can we count?
One...

501
00:55:03,856 --> 00:55:08,732
Can you count with me? One...

502
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:49,857
Alms for the needy.
Alms for the needy, sir.

503
00:55:58,274 --> 00:56:01,107
I too had riches once.

504
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:05,774
Far greater
than imagination could hold.

505
00:56:06,524 --> 00:56:09,232
A kingdom.

506
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:11,440
I know who you are.

507
00:56:11,482 --> 00:56:16,065
One beggar cannot take alms
from another.

508
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,190
Good day, sir.

509
00:56:20,232 --> 00:56:26,607
Alms for the needy.
Alms for the needy.

510
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:41,440
Pray together.

511
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:42,732
Forgive us our trespasses,

512
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:47,274
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

513
00:56:48,858 --> 00:56:53,482
Sir, something sits heavy
on your mind.

514
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:56,190
I'm winning.

515
00:56:56,232 --> 00:56:59,232
And that too
without much of an effort.

516
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,816
Sir...

517
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:22,982
I am trying
to build these dreams

518
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:27,108
that were once our reality
in our lands.

519
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,025
I am fooling myself

520
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:34,899
into believing that I am someone
that clearly...

521
00:57:35,857 --> 00:57:38,024
I am not.

522
00:57:38,899 --> 00:57:42,400
And neither are you, Arur.

523
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:48,149
We are living
a life of illusion.

524
00:57:49,274 --> 00:57:52,525
Can you continue
to live with that, Arur?

525
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,233
We are Sikhs.

526
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:02,899
Yes, sir. We are Sikhs.

527
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:07,858
We have a kingdom, do we not?

528
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,732
Yes, sir, we do.

529
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,107
And I... its king.

530
00:58:17,483 --> 00:58:20,025
Yes, sir.

531
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:25,358
Maharaja, Arur Singh. Maharaja.

532
00:58:29,524 --> 00:58:32,108
Come, my prince. Drink.

533
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,608
The tea is just wonderful.

534
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,816
I believe it's from Assam.

535
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:43,400
Yes, Your Majesty.
I believe it is.

536
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:55,316
I wish to ask something,
Your Majesty.

537
00:58:56,525 --> 00:58:59,441
Yes? Do speak.

538
00:58:59,733 --> 00:59:03,108
About the Kingdom of Punjab.

539
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,608
Yes, there was a kingdom.

540
00:59:07,107 --> 00:59:09,983
And I, its king.

541
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:12,525
Yes.

542
00:59:12,566 --> 00:59:18,816
Taken from me
by lies and deceit.

543
00:59:19,816 --> 00:59:21,858
They were God-fearing men

544
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,941
who thought of what was best
for you and the people.

545
00:59:24,983 --> 00:59:27,816
Their concerns were not
for my wellbeing

546
00:59:27,858 --> 00:59:30,108
or the wellbeing of our people.

547
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,692
They were not the Christians
they professed to be.

548
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:35,566
They were not men of truth.

549
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:39,775
Then tell me of a kingdom
built on truth, Duleep.

550
00:59:39,816 --> 00:59:42,900
The kingdom of my father.

551
00:59:42,941 --> 00:59:47,234
Your father was a man of truth,
from what I know of him.

552
00:59:47,276 --> 00:59:51,691
But what happened
after he died, hmm?

553
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:53,983
A kingdom in disarray.

554
00:59:54,025 --> 00:59:57,025
The only truthful kingdom
I know of, Duleep,

555
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:59,609
is the kingdom of our Lord.

556
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:05,066
What you seek is all gone now,
my Black Prince.

557
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:12,526
I am not a prince.

558
01:00:23,316 --> 01:00:25,234
Maharaja?

559
01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:35,316
I am very pleased to see you
looking like a Sikh.

560
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:37,734
But this is a state function.

561
01:00:37,776 --> 01:00:40,984
It will raise a lot of eyebrows.

562
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:46,400
I am who I am.

563
01:00:47,191 --> 01:00:49,150
A Sikh.

564
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:50,859
Come, Arur Singh.

565
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:56,650
We have a function to attend
and eyebrows to raise.

566
01:01:28,526 --> 01:01:29,859
The Punjab papers.

567
01:01:29,901 --> 01:01:32,776
Finally available
to the people.

568
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:36,150
"Maharani Jindan is
a serious obstacle

569
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:39,942
to our interest
in the Kingdom of Punjab.

570
01:01:39,984 --> 01:01:40,901
Every effort must be made

571
01:01:40,942 --> 01:01:43,942
to discredit her
among her people.

572
01:01:43,984 --> 01:01:45,609
Separate her from power.

573
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:48,192
Take the young Maharaja
away from her.

574
01:01:48,234 --> 01:01:52,526
Only then we will have
a clear road to victory."

575
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:56,276
The world needs to know.

576
01:01:56,692 --> 01:01:57,526
They need to be awakened

577
01:01:57,567 --> 01:02:02,401
to the reality of who and what
the British really are.

578
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,983
A bunch of Fagins.

579
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:08,276
For what they did
to a little boy.

580
01:02:08,317 --> 01:02:11,151
They stole his childhood...

581
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,942
and tore out his heart.

582
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:14,359
And in the process
of their deceit,

583
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:21,234
they decapitated a great kingdom
and drank its blood and glory.

584
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:23,609
Glory.

585
01:02:23,651 --> 01:02:26,359
Not of valor,
not of any brave act.

586
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:29,442
But cunningness and fraud.

587
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:47,901
A letter, Arur Singh.
ToThe Times.

588
01:02:47,942 --> 01:02:49,651
Exposing all
that we have learned

589
01:02:49,692 --> 01:02:52,484
about how the English stole
the Kingdom of Punjab

590
01:02:52,526 --> 01:02:56,152
and betrayed
the trust of my father.

591
01:02:56,193 --> 01:02:57,776
I will demand,
in no uncertain terms,

592
01:02:57,817 --> 01:03:00,942
that what is rightfully mine
be given back to me

593
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:05,276
without any further delay
or removes.

594
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,401
Maharaja.

595
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:24,067
I have read your memorial
to Lord Salisbury.

596
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:28,567
Sir O'Burne,
you are an hour late.

597
01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:30,484
I have waited.

598
01:03:31,692 --> 01:03:32,942
I do apologize.

599
01:03:32,984 --> 01:03:36,152
But I cannot comprehend
how a person in your position

600
01:03:36,193 --> 01:03:37,776
could court a rebuff, by demand,

601
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:40,026
something that no government
in their right mind

602
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:44,109
would ever consider,
much less satisfy.

603
01:03:44,151 --> 01:03:47,860
You are talking of transactions
of nearly half a century ago,

604
01:03:47,902 --> 01:03:50,527
which if reopened,
as you desire,

605
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:51,484
would reopen every act

606
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:54,026
of the state
of British government in India.

607
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:57,442
That may not be
such a bad thing.

608
01:03:57,484 --> 01:03:59,860
Truth is all I seek.

609
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:04,152
They have treated me
like an animal.

610
01:04:04,193 --> 01:04:06,984
They are trying to buy
my silence with a pittance.

611
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:11,192
They are now trying to goad me
into desperation.

612
01:04:11,234 --> 01:04:12,985
They forget I am a king!

613
01:04:13,027 --> 01:04:16,443
You surrendered your kingdom
with alacrity.

614
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,610
You could say
nothing at the time

615
01:04:17,652 --> 01:04:19,401
of the justice
that was dealt out to you.

616
01:04:19,442 --> 01:04:23,776
Justice?
Injustice of the highest order.

617
01:04:24,442 --> 01:04:29,568
than total and complete
governance of my kingdom.

618
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:30,860
By me.

619
01:04:30,902 --> 01:04:34,859
The government of India wants
to get rid of me and my family,

620
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:38,360
that we may sink into oblivion?

621
01:04:39,027 --> 01:04:40,235
That will not happen.

622
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:44,902
I will not vanish
without a fight.

623
01:04:52,693 --> 01:04:56,985
My mother had said to me there's
only one man I can trust.

624
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:59,192
Sardar Thakur Singh Sandhawalia.

625
01:04:59,234 --> 01:05:01,651
We cannot turn back now,
Arur Singh.

626
01:05:01,692 --> 01:05:07,110
And live in England in
an utter state of humiliation.

627
01:05:07,152 --> 01:05:10,402
My pleas, my democratic approach
for justice,

628
01:05:10,443 --> 01:05:13,192
has fallen on deaf ears.

629
01:05:13,234 --> 01:05:15,985
The government doesn't care.

630
01:05:16,027 --> 01:05:18,277
The Prime Minister is afraid
to meet with me,

631
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:22,985
even for a few minutes,
to listen to our grievances.

632
01:05:23,027 --> 01:05:25,777
And now, as Sikhs,
we must not just demand

633
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:29,402
but take back
what is rightfully ours.

634
01:05:29,443 --> 01:05:33,902
Send a wire
to Thakur Singh Sandhawalia.

635
01:05:34,777 --> 01:05:37,068
Immediately, Maharaja.

636
01:05:48,985 --> 01:05:53,192
Maharaja? They are here.

637
01:06:03,277 --> 01:06:05,735
Thakur Singh, Maharaja.

638
01:06:05,777 --> 01:06:08,193
So many years have passed.

639
01:06:08,235 --> 01:06:11,735
It was a very long
and arduous journey,

640
01:06:11,777 --> 01:06:16,485
but now we are here
to take you home.

641
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:20,069
There is so much I want to know,
Thakur Singh.

642
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:23,693
You must tell me everything.

643
01:06:24,235 --> 01:06:26,652
Yes, Maharaja.

644
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:32,153
You are the heir
to the Sikh Kingdom of Punjab.

645
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:35,360
TheKhalsawill rise.

646
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:39,068
Khalsajust needs a purpose.

647
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:43,527
Khalsaneeds you.

648
01:06:44,944 --> 01:06:47,777
That pure and holy land...

649
01:06:48,568 --> 01:06:55,110
awaits the fulfillment
of the prophecy.

650
01:07:00,985 --> 01:07:03,193
The prophecy?

651
01:07:05,443 --> 01:07:10,819
You must re-embrace your faith.

652
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:12,486
Not only in principle,

653
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:18,360
but also in appearance, deeds
and actions.

654
01:07:21,152 --> 01:07:25,153
My soul yearns to be a Sikh.

655
01:07:26,944 --> 01:07:30,027
Then it shall be done
as your heart desires.

656
01:07:30,068 --> 01:07:32,943
The soil of your birth
awaits your arrival.

657
01:07:32,985 --> 01:07:37,153
They will celebrate the return
of their real king.

658
01:07:37,194 --> 01:07:40,986
When you embrace your faith
again...

659
01:07:41,527 --> 01:07:43,360
theKhalsawill rise.

660
01:07:43,402 --> 01:07:48,736
Their cry of victory will be
heard across the land.

661
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:56,693
This money is for holy offerings
at the Golden Temple.

662
01:07:56,735 --> 01:07:59,318
Pray for my swift return
to our beloved homeland.

663
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:04,403
I am restless to meet my people
and see my palace.

664
01:08:06,819 --> 01:08:12,653
Until that time,
you will find solace in this.

665
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:15,694
These are the prayers
of our Gurus.

666
01:08:15,736 --> 01:08:19,361
These are the only treasures
we seek in life.

667
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:27,528
What is this, Maharaja?

668
01:09:29,944 --> 01:09:32,111
What of me?

669
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:35,111
And the children?

670
01:09:35,403 --> 01:09:42,445
You are Christian.
As am I, and the children.

671
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:46,611
And Christian
we shall always be.

672
01:09:47,736 --> 01:09:50,903
In life and in death.

673
01:09:51,444 --> 01:09:54,570
We are your family.

674
01:09:55,654 --> 01:09:58,778
Don't destroy us...

675
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:00,444
I beg of you.

676
01:10:00,486 --> 01:10:06,654
I plead mercy with you,
do not abandon this family.

677
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:14,486
We are all you have, Maharaja!

678
01:10:15,903 --> 01:10:18,819
The kingdom is gone.

679
01:10:18,944 --> 01:10:23,195
Subjects fake, prophecy false.

680
01:10:24,944 --> 01:10:28,861
Look around you.
What do you see?

681
01:10:30,361 --> 01:10:34,237
Decay of your madness!

682
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:04,112
"My Sikh brothers,
I beg your forgiveness

683
01:11:04,154 --> 01:11:05,444
for adopting a foreign religion

684
01:11:05,486 --> 01:11:07,736
and forsaking the faith
of my ancestors.

685
01:11:07,778 --> 01:11:09,528
I wish to be baptized
as a Sikh again.

686
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:12,070
It is now my desire
to return again to Bombay.

687
01:11:12,112 --> 01:11:15,695
By the grace of the Almighty,
this will happen.

688
01:11:15,737 --> 01:11:20,611
My beloved countrymen,
I am your own fresh and blood.

689
01:11:20,653 --> 01:11:26,695
Every second, my heart yearns to
set foot on my homeland again.

690
01:11:26,737 --> 01:11:28,862
In order to reclaim
the Sikh kingdom,

691
01:11:28,904 --> 01:11:32,528
I need my Sikh brothers
by my side."

692
01:11:32,569 --> 01:11:37,570
Our king is coming
to lead us to freedom.

693
01:11:37,612 --> 01:11:38,862
Blessed shall be those

694
01:11:38,904 --> 01:11:41,945
who praise
the True and Timeless One!

695
01:11:41,987 --> 01:11:45,194
O Nanak, through this Naam,
a state of bliss is obtained!

696
01:11:45,236 --> 01:11:49,529
With your grace,
may all mankind be well!

697
01:12:10,195 --> 01:12:11,654
You do know that by doing this,

698
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:15,862
you risk the loss
of all that you have?

699
01:12:17,112 --> 01:12:22,404
I have already taken the first
steps to abjure Christianity...

700
01:12:23,695 --> 01:12:25,487
for I no longer have faith

701
01:12:25,529 --> 01:12:29,445
in the so-called
Christian government.

702
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:35,070
I am resolved to go to India.

703
01:12:40,362 --> 01:12:41,237
The government of India

704
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,279
is prepared to offer you
a much higher stipend.

705
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,320
Which shall be more than
sufficient to cover your needs.

706
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:52,071
But it will require your total
and absolute surrender.

707
01:12:52,363 --> 01:12:56,862
No more of
your nonsensical demands.

708
01:13:04,821 --> 01:13:09,362
You insult me
with your arrogance.

709
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:13,779
May Nanak's blessings
be upon you.

710
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:34,195
A man from the India Office

711
01:13:34,237 --> 01:13:37,945
offered me £50,000
to change my mind.

712
01:13:37,987 --> 01:13:42,363
To accept my destiny
as an English subject.

713
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,238
It's not about the money.

714
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,155
It's not about
my personal wealth.

715
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:52,445
It's not about the riches
that give our body comforts.

716
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:57,738
It's about the yearning
in my soul...

717
01:13:58,363 --> 01:13:59,113
to be free,

718
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:04,320
to lead my people
as free soldiers of God's army.

719
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:08,780
Soldiers of theKhalsa.

720
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:09,696
I want to belong.

721
01:14:09,738 --> 01:14:14,612
They are watching us.
Our every move, Maharaja.

722
01:14:14,654 --> 01:14:18,904
I know.
Let them. We will go.

723
01:14:18,945 --> 01:14:21,946
We will strike a dagger
in their fat bellies.

724
01:14:21,988 --> 01:14:25,155
Not in their backs,
like they did with us.

725
01:14:25,196 --> 01:14:27,196
We will look them in their eyes,

726
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:29,654
see their dishonesty,
their fear,

727
01:14:29,695 --> 01:14:32,320
and then bury that dagger
deep into their flesh.

728
01:14:32,362 --> 01:14:39,113
We sail for India
and take back my kingdom.

729
01:14:39,905 --> 01:14:42,695
Are you with me, Arur Singh?

730
01:14:43,987 --> 01:14:45,905
Yes, Maharaja.

731
01:14:58,405 --> 01:14:59,946
Is that all, sir?

732
01:14:59,988 --> 01:15:02,446
Yes, that is all.

733
01:15:02,488 --> 01:15:08,862
These four telegrams are to be
sent 24 hours after I leave.

734
01:15:09,654 --> 01:15:13,363
Thank you, sir. Will do so, sir.

735
01:15:13,905 --> 01:15:17,488
God be with you on your journey,
sir.

736
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:20,696
Thank you.

737
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,905
Good day, my good man.

738
01:16:04,155 --> 01:16:07,696
And this one, sir,
is addressed to you personally.

739
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:11,071
From Lord Kimberley.

740
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:23,321
"The Maharaja cannot be allowed
to set foot on Indian soil."

741
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:28,572
See to it.

742
01:16:29,239 --> 01:16:31,155
Yes, sir.

743
01:16:34,113 --> 01:16:38,696
It's important for me to hold this family

744
01:16:38,738 --> 01:16:41,239
Embarking on this journey.
A new dream.

745
01:16:41,281 --> 01:16:46,363
They will be real princes and
princesses of a real kingdom.

746
01:16:46,405 --> 01:16:53,531
Prince Victor one day will
take my place as the Maharaja.

747
01:16:53,781 --> 01:16:57,905
They need to be part
of the journey, Arur Singh.

748
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:01,571
When I take the true name
of the Khalsa

749
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:06,614
and embrace all that
it represents within my soul...

750
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:12,321
They need to witness that.
They need to see its power.

751
01:17:12,988 --> 01:17:15,113
And the desire for them

752
01:17:15,155 --> 01:17:19,447
to become one with me
and the Guru...

753
01:17:20,072 --> 01:17:22,572
must come from them.

754
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:42,405
My sovereign,
before quitting England,

755
01:17:42,446 --> 01:17:45,156
I humbly venture
to address Your Majesty

756
01:17:45,197 --> 01:17:49,531
in order to convey the
inexpressible gratitude I feel

757
01:17:49,572 --> 01:17:51,696
for all
Your Majesty's graciousness,

758
01:17:51,738 --> 01:17:55,864
both to me and mine during
my stay here in this country,

759
01:17:55,906 --> 01:17:59,781
I could not face the pain that
such an event would cause me

760
01:17:59,822 --> 01:18:02,114
if I ventured to take my leave
in person.

761
01:18:02,156 --> 01:18:06,363
And therefore I humbly implore
Your Majesty's forgiveness.

762
01:18:06,405 --> 01:18:11,447
Your heartbroken subject,
Duleep Singh.

763
01:18:46,697 --> 01:18:52,781
Maharaja Duleep Singh.
I am Brigadier-General Hogg.

764
01:18:52,822 --> 01:18:55,114
You are to come with me, sir.

765
01:18:55,156 --> 01:18:57,031
You are placing me under arrest?

766
01:18:57,072 --> 01:19:00,822
My instructions, sir,
are to escort you off the ship

767
01:19:00,864 --> 01:19:05,281
as your onward passage to India
is not permitted.

768
01:19:05,322 --> 01:19:08,281
Am I to see a difference
in an arrest

769
01:19:08,322 --> 01:19:13,114
and what I am being made
to do against my free will?

770
01:19:13,156 --> 01:19:17,739
You will need to place handcuffs
on me, Brigadier.

771
01:19:18,197 --> 01:19:21,864
Because I am your prisoner.

772
01:19:22,114 --> 01:19:27,114
That will not be necessary,
Maharaja.

773
01:19:27,156 --> 01:19:31,364
Please, come with me.

774
01:19:35,447 --> 01:19:43,031
I leave this ship unwillingly,
as a prisoner of the English.

775
01:20:12,822 --> 01:20:14,364
How long will you keep me here?

776
01:20:14,406 --> 01:20:18,615
That depends entirely on you,
Maharaja.

777
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:23,489
However, India is not possible.

778
01:20:31,907 --> 01:20:36,406
Maharaja, they are here.

779
01:20:38,114 --> 01:20:40,657
We will have to find
two more Khalsa Singhs.

780
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:43,490
There is a transport ship,
just touched the shores.

781
01:20:43,532 --> 01:20:48,781
I hear there areKhalsaSinghs
among the shipmates.

782
01:20:49,281 --> 01:20:53,073
There are nether worlds
beneath nether worlds,

783
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:57,365
and hundreds of thousands
of heavenly worlds above.

784
01:20:57,407 --> 01:20:59,948
The Vedas say you can
keep searching for them

785
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:00,447
until you grow weary.

786
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:03,031
The Scriptures say that there
are 18,000 worlds

787
01:21:03,072 --> 01:21:05,490
but in reality
there is only one universe.

788
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:06,782
If you try to write an account
of this,

789
01:21:06,823 --> 01:21:09,365
you will come to the end
of your life before you finish.

790
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:16,864
O Nanak, call Him Great!
He Himself knows Himself.

791
01:21:17,281 --> 01:21:23,157
On this very day, I celebrate
my rebirth as a Sikh.

792
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:27,198
And I thank you, my brothers.

793
01:21:53,407 --> 01:21:59,115
The children must be relieved.

794
01:22:03,907 --> 01:22:06,698
They will miss you.

795
01:22:10,573 --> 01:22:12,865
As will I.

796
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:23,782
I'm... I'm really sorry.

797
01:24:45,949 --> 01:24:49,366
Will I ever see you again?

798
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:05,448
Yes, I know.

799
01:25:06,991 --> 01:25:09,408
Your destiny.

800
01:25:18,115 --> 01:25:21,824
They cannot keep us
out of our land forever.

801
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,449
And I refuse to go back
to England,

802
01:25:23,491 --> 01:25:27,241
a country that I had denounced
as an enemy

803
01:25:27,283 --> 01:25:29,241
and no longer our home.

804
01:25:29,283 --> 01:25:32,199
Then what, Maharaja?

805
01:25:33,908 --> 01:25:35,866
Paris.

806
01:25:39,741 --> 01:25:43,866
Ada, thank you
for joining me here.

807
01:25:49,491 --> 01:25:52,824
Mr. Patrick Casey, the Maharaja.

808
01:25:52,866 --> 01:25:57,575
The bravest fighting men.
Warriors.

809
01:25:57,617 --> 01:25:59,699
Your Sikhs need to fight
the right war.

810
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:03,533
There's nobody that hates
the English more than the Irish.

811
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:05,199
And we have many friends.

812
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:08,991
It's an honor to meet you,
Maharaja.

813
01:26:10,242 --> 01:26:14,158
Oh, yes. Please meet
General Charles Tevis,

814
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:18,241
American
and an enemy of the English.

815
01:26:18,283 --> 01:26:21,449
An honor, Maharaja.

816
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:25,284
Have you tried
reasoning with the English?

817
01:26:25,325 --> 01:26:28,283
I have tried everything
short of begging.

818
01:26:28,324 --> 01:26:31,074
Sometimes even that
may not be a bad idea.

819
01:26:31,116 --> 01:26:33,908
I'm surprised to hear that
from you, General.

820
01:26:33,949 --> 01:26:36,617
Perhaps I have seen
way too much bloodshed.

821
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:40,699
Blood is what it will
have to be, General Tevis.

822
01:26:40,741 --> 01:26:47,116
If that's how you feel,
then that's what it will be.

823
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:49,825
And it's Charles.

824
01:26:56,408 --> 01:27:00,492
Dr. Elie de Cyon, I wanted to
introduce you to the Maharaja,

825
01:27:00,534 --> 01:27:03,450
sovereign to the Sikh nation.

826
01:27:08,241 --> 01:27:10,866
As soon as the Russians
have completed the railway

827
01:27:10,908 --> 01:27:12,449
they are building in
Central Asia,

828
01:27:12,491 --> 01:27:14,367
a Russian army,
along with myself,

829
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:19,117
will invade India
through Afghanistan.

830
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:21,074
Sikh soldiers
in the British Army will desert

831
01:27:21,116 --> 01:27:23,033
and place themselves
under my command.

832
01:27:23,074 --> 01:27:26,242
We need to proceed to Russia
immediately.

833
01:27:26,284 --> 01:27:29,659
Katkov will facilitate a meeting
with the Tsar.

834
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:30,409
I talked to Zubayr Pasha

835
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:33,491
and Sudan is ready
to be part of the plan.

836
01:27:33,533 --> 01:27:36,574
And so are Egypt and Turkey.

837
01:27:36,866 --> 01:27:40,284
Native kings of Hindustan
will attack British soldiers,

838
01:27:40,325 --> 01:27:42,325
destroy railway
and telegraph lines.

839
01:27:42,367 --> 01:27:45,867
Indians will rise as one
against the British.

840
01:27:45,909 --> 01:27:49,283
On our front, the Irish will
cause havoc for the English,

841
01:27:49,324 --> 01:27:53,242
the likes of which
they've never seen before.

842
01:27:53,284 --> 01:27:58,242
Gentlemen, the great war
against the British

843
01:27:58,284 --> 01:28:00,783
is about to begin.

844
01:28:09,325 --> 01:28:09,992
Everything?

845
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:13,908
Yes, everything
the English need to know.

846
01:28:13,949 --> 01:28:16,950
I will keep you posted further.

847
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:48,159
Duleep!

848
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,200
Ada, they are not going
to leave us alone.

849
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:53,867
Get to the station
and I will meet you there.

850
01:28:53,909 --> 01:28:56,159
Hurry. This way.

851
01:30:13,493 --> 01:30:16,867
Good. You are here.

852
01:30:24,451 --> 01:30:29,076
Patrick Casey.
I am now an Irish rebel.

853
01:30:29,118 --> 01:30:30,700
It is a war, my friend.

854
01:30:30,742 --> 01:30:33,367
In this war,
we are all what we have to be.

855
01:30:33,409 --> 01:30:37,160
We are Irish, French, Russian,
and we are Sikh.

856
01:30:37,201 --> 01:30:38,785
We have a common foe.

857
01:30:38,826 --> 01:30:42,743
Those papers will allow you to
travel into the heart of Russia,

858
01:30:42,784 --> 01:30:44,075
have your meeting with the Tsar,

859
01:30:44,117 --> 01:30:46,492
and raise an army
against the British.

860
01:30:46,534 --> 01:30:50,868
And you will
get your kingdom back.

861
01:30:52,743 --> 01:30:54,910
Good luck, my friend.

862
01:30:57,492 --> 01:31:01,451
Maharaja,
everything is on board.

863
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:27,910
-Maharaja.
-Mr. Katkov.

864
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:29,410
Everything is fine, Maharaja.

865
01:31:29,451 --> 01:31:33,660
The Tsar is very well aware of
your presence here in Russia.

866
01:31:33,701 --> 01:31:35,493
It is only a matter
of a little time

867
01:31:35,535 --> 01:31:38,200
for us to set
a strategic meeting with him.

868
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:42,118
I understand, but there is
so much that needs to be done.

869
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:42,993
So many points of interest

870
01:31:43,035 --> 01:31:46,868
that need to be connected
and timed across the world.

871
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:49,868
And everything depends
on our meeting the Tsar.

872
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:51,701
He is the key in all this.

873
01:31:51,743 --> 01:31:56,493
I promise, I will do something
very quickly.

874
01:32:30,077 --> 01:32:35,868
Arur, come. Sit.

875
01:32:42,244 --> 01:32:43,952
You must proceed to India.

876
01:32:43,994 --> 01:32:46,868
All arrangements
have been made for you.

877
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:50,035
You are to meet
Shashi Bhusan Mukerji.

878
01:32:50,076 --> 01:32:50,410
He has promised funds,

879
01:32:50,451 --> 01:32:54,410
raised in the name
of the rebellion.

880
01:32:54,451 --> 01:32:55,911
Liberation is not far.

881
01:32:55,952 --> 01:33:00,285
There are many forces at work
in India.

882
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:06,243
Your papers and funds
for your travels.

883
01:33:08,244 --> 01:33:12,326
Maharaja. As you command me.

884
01:33:12,368 --> 01:33:16,993
By the grace of God,
we will meet again soon.

885
01:33:17,035 --> 01:33:22,536
I, Khalsa , belong to God.
Victory belongs to God.

886
01:33:22,577 --> 01:33:28,118
Mr. Arur Singh, we are pleased
to see you in India.

887
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:32,243
As you can see,
we are ready now...

888
01:33:32,285 --> 01:33:34,452
and we are waiting.

889
01:33:34,494 --> 01:33:37,161
As you know,
our Maharaja is in Russia

890
01:33:37,202 --> 01:33:45,160
and will lead the Russian Army
through Afghanistan, into India.

891
01:33:45,201 --> 01:33:47,744
How many Sikh soldiers
are in Afghanistan

892
01:33:47,786 --> 01:33:48,994
with the British Army?

893
01:33:49,036 --> 01:33:50,369
About 20,000.

894
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:54,118
But we have roughly 40,000
spread throughout India.

895
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:54,701
Will they join us?

896
01:33:54,743 --> 01:33:58,161
Yes. Every last one of them,
as well as their commanders,

897
01:33:58,202 --> 01:34:00,577
have pledged
to support the Maharaja.

898
01:34:00,619 --> 01:34:04,911
They have all sworn an oath
to the Guru Granth Sahib.

899
01:34:04,952 --> 01:34:08,826
125,000KukaSinghs
are ready to fight.

900
01:34:08,868 --> 01:34:10,118
Except for Nepal,

901
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,786
all the native states
are with us

902
01:34:11,827 --> 01:34:15,077
and ready to take up arms
against the British.

903
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:19,868
The Sikh kingdom
will finally be liberated.

904
01:34:31,077 --> 01:34:32,494
Mr. Arur Singh?

905
01:34:32,536 --> 01:34:34,743
Mr. Mukerji.

906
01:34:34,785 --> 01:34:36,994
You look very tired.

907
01:34:37,036 --> 01:34:38,869
You've had a long journey.

908
01:34:38,911 --> 01:34:39,702
I am feeling thirsty.

909
01:34:39,744 --> 01:34:43,494
Of course.
We have much to talk about.

910
01:34:43,536 --> 01:34:46,202
Please, follow me.

911
01:34:46,494 --> 01:34:48,743
Kingdoms are not raised
overnight, Mr. Katkov.

912
01:34:48,785 --> 01:34:52,077
I do understand that.
But time is what worries me.

913
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:52,494
How long?

914
01:34:52,536 --> 01:34:55,994
I have been here, waiting,
getting impatient.

915
01:34:56,036 --> 01:34:57,119
Soon, my friend. Soon.

916
01:34:57,161 --> 01:34:59,077
I have been hearing that
for so many months.

917
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:00,868
My people are waiting
with eagerness.

918
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:04,577
But nothing seems to progress
on your end.

919
01:35:06,244 --> 01:35:09,994
I will speak to the Tsar.

920
01:35:21,286 --> 01:35:25,952
How long do we have
to wait for them?

921
01:35:25,994 --> 01:35:30,369
Katkov has promised to arrange
a meeting with Alexander.

922
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:35,452
His efforts are noble.
We must have patience.

923
01:36:10,994 --> 01:36:16,869
Arur Singh, I am going
to ask this one more time.

924
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:19,620
We know that
you have not come to India

925
01:36:19,662 --> 01:36:22,827
for some well-deserved holiday.

926
01:36:22,994 --> 01:36:25,869
So speak clearly.

927
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:33,037
Who are you to meet here?

928
01:36:33,078 --> 01:36:38,161
And what is the purpose
of your visit?

929
01:36:48,287 --> 01:36:54,286
How about a glass of brandy?
On ice?

930
01:37:12,495 --> 01:37:14,578
Sir.

931
01:37:16,411 --> 01:37:21,120
He wants brandy. On ice.

932
01:37:23,495 --> 01:37:25,328
Will not talk.

933
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:29,077
The likes of him
would rather die.

934
01:37:48,787 --> 01:37:51,495
Let go of me!

935
01:38:00,287 --> 01:38:02,370
Well, brother...

936
01:38:03,912 --> 01:38:06,370
Did you ask for brandy too?

937
01:38:06,412 --> 01:38:13,078
My brother, I wish my demand
had been so simple.

938
01:38:14,078 --> 01:38:16,037
I asked for my country,

939
01:38:16,078 --> 01:38:19,120
to liberate my motherland
from these foreigners.

940
01:38:19,162 --> 01:38:24,620
I promised to shed English
and traitor blood.

941
01:38:25,453 --> 01:38:29,828
Then our dreams have
something in common.

942
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:44,370
Thakur Singh?

943
01:38:45,995 --> 01:38:49,579
I hope the food tastes good.

944
01:38:57,287 --> 01:39:02,663
Clean him up
and lay him on his bed.

945
01:39:09,745 --> 01:39:11,787
Come out!

946
01:39:17,453 --> 01:39:21,620
God, give me your protection
and destroy my enemies now.

947
01:39:21,662 --> 01:39:24,578
I pray that my wish for peace
is fulfilled.

948
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:28,121
Bless me, God,
and I shall never forsake You.

949
01:39:28,163 --> 01:39:31,787
Whatever I seek,
I will look for it only in You.

950
01:39:31,828 --> 01:39:34,203
Liberate us all.

951
01:39:42,954 --> 01:39:47,370
-How is she?
-Sleeping.

952
01:39:51,037 --> 01:39:54,788
There's no news
from Arur Singh or the others.

953
01:39:54,829 --> 01:40:00,328
Now that Katkov is dead,
the Tsar will not meet us.

954
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:06,288
We have to go back to Paris
and rethink our move.

955
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:29,412
Sir, everybody
has been arrested,

956
01:40:29,453 --> 01:40:32,246
killed or banished to Kala Pani.

957
01:40:32,288 --> 01:40:36,829
The so-called rebellion
of Maharaja Duleep Singh

958
01:40:36,871 --> 01:40:39,078
has been crushed.

959
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:47,746
You will be duly rewarded
for your services to the Crown.

960
01:40:47,788 --> 01:40:51,496
But one more thing, Aziz Ud-Din.

961
01:40:56,162 --> 01:40:58,538
Thank you, sir.

962
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:49,371
That's all I could get.

963
01:42:05,829 --> 01:42:08,413
Maharaja?

964
01:42:09,454 --> 01:42:16,038
Finally, I set eyes on the man
behind the roar...

965
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:20,121
as I come to deliver you
the news that it is all over.

966
01:42:20,163 --> 01:42:23,079
It has all come to an end.

967
01:42:23,121 --> 01:42:27,579
I hate to be the man known
for assassinating a king.

968
01:42:27,621 --> 01:42:33,371
But what is a king
without a kingdom?

969
01:43:14,038 --> 01:43:18,039
Quickly.
Please, take me to a doctor.

970
01:43:39,204 --> 01:43:41,455
Please, hurry.

971
01:43:43,122 --> 01:43:46,830
There has to be some doctor
available.

972
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:18,914
Victor. My son.

973
01:44:20,664 --> 01:44:24,747
You've found time
to come see me.

974
01:44:29,704 --> 01:44:32,497
I am most tired.

975
01:44:34,747 --> 01:44:40,164
I beg you, Father, please.

976
01:44:40,205 --> 01:44:43,121
Write to the Queen.

977
01:44:43,746 --> 01:44:47,122
There is no other hope.

978
01:44:47,997 --> 01:44:51,497
You have lost everything.

979
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:55,455
We are in extreme debts.

980
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,664
We are poor.

981
01:45:00,039 --> 01:45:03,164
Please, ask for the pardon

982
01:45:03,205 --> 01:45:05,455
so that your pensions
can be restored

983
01:45:05,497 --> 01:45:10,539
and we can live
with a little sense of dignity.

984
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:12,789
Dignity?

985
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:24,122
I am the son
of the Lion of Punjab.

986
01:45:25,747 --> 01:45:32,664
And you, my blood...
his blood...

987
01:45:32,705 --> 01:45:37,955
All that is now gone. Forever!

988
01:45:38,955 --> 01:45:42,289
Wake up to the truth.

989
01:45:51,122 --> 01:45:55,497
Arur Singh, you are a free man.

990
01:45:56,289 --> 01:45:58,455
Go home.

991
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:01,290
It's all over.

992
01:46:03,206 --> 01:46:07,914
And be thankful
we didn't hang you by the neck.

993
01:46:34,164 --> 01:46:36,664
Maharaja?

994
01:46:52,498 --> 01:46:55,706
As everyone else in my life...

995
01:46:57,706 --> 01:47:01,830
you betrayed me too, Arur Singh.

996
01:47:04,373 --> 01:47:07,206
Why did you come back?

997
01:47:07,248 --> 01:47:11,789
So that you will know the truth,
Maharaja.

998
01:47:14,747 --> 01:47:16,748
The truth?

999
01:47:17,581 --> 01:47:20,998
Our people
have sold their souls.

1000
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,873
The British are far too clever.

1001
01:47:24,331 --> 01:47:29,248
Yes. Is that the truth?

1002
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:36,581
And the prophecy, Maharaja...
is false.

1003
01:47:39,455 --> 01:47:42,415
Guru Gobind Singh...

1004
01:47:44,706 --> 01:47:47,915
could not be a false prophet.

1005
01:47:47,956 --> 01:47:48,373
It was the creation

1006
01:47:48,415 --> 01:47:55,581
of those who wanted much more
than what your heart desired.

1007
01:47:56,873 --> 01:48:01,373
So the prophecy was never his?

1008
01:48:03,248 --> 01:48:05,081
It was not.

1009
01:48:08,123 --> 01:48:11,456
The irony of it all...

1010
01:49:02,206 --> 01:49:05,248
They should have killed me...

1011
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:09,456
when I was a child.

1012
01:49:10,249 --> 01:49:15,540
Those good Christian men.

1013
01:49:16,956 --> 01:49:18,706
And have history speak of me

1014
01:49:18,748 --> 01:49:24,249
as the queen responsible for
the biggest tragedy of all time?

1015
01:49:26,707 --> 01:49:29,873
I have enough to live with.

1016
01:49:34,873 --> 01:49:38,249
All I ever wanted was...

1017
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:41,331
my childhood.

1018
01:49:42,456 --> 01:49:46,456
And all I ever wanted
was the love of a child.

1019
01:49:48,749 --> 01:49:51,041
My son.

1020
01:49:54,081 --> 01:49:55,665
And now?

1021
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,873
Now...

1022
01:50:01,207 --> 01:50:05,166
we are mere symbols
of who we were.

1023
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:13,749
Forgive me, my son.

1024
01:50:16,041 --> 01:50:18,957
For we have wronged you.

1025
01:50:24,498 --> 01:50:28,457
And now I am so helpless.

1026
01:50:49,248 --> 01:50:52,249
Keep them, my child.

1027
01:51:45,541 --> 01:51:47,666
Who are you?

1028
01:51:48,916 --> 01:51:50,874
I am Colonel Hurbon.

1029
01:51:50,916 --> 01:51:53,332
I served your father well.

1030
01:51:53,374 --> 01:51:56,957
And I saved your life.

1031
01:52:01,666 --> 01:52:01,916
Why?

1032
01:52:01,957 --> 01:52:05,999
So that you would rise
to be king.

1033
01:52:07,332 --> 01:52:10,874
But I did not save you for this.

1034
01:52:13,666 --> 01:52:17,374
I am sorry to disappoint you.

1035
01:52:19,874 --> 01:52:23,791
But there isn't much left in me.

1036
01:52:26,166 --> 01:52:28,582
I tried.

1037
01:52:29,041 --> 01:52:30,749
And now?

1038
01:52:34,208 --> 01:52:40,332
A wave will rise
across the Indian soil.

1039
01:52:41,166 --> 01:52:46,125
My Sikh brothers
will spill blood.

1040
01:52:46,167 --> 01:52:51,416
Theirs and of their enemy's.

1041
01:52:53,332 --> 01:53:00,167
And the English will be
driven out of India for good.

1042
01:53:02,625 --> 01:53:05,332
That day will come.

1043
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:08,749
Is that your prophecy?

1044
01:53:09,374 --> 01:53:11,167
No.

1045
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,500
That is my belief.

1046
01:54:36,208 --> 01:54:39,792
May my people forgive me...

1047
01:54:44,375 --> 01:54:48,208
for I could not be the king...

1048
01:54:50,333 --> 01:54:53,208
that I was to be.

1049
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:57,875
Victory will be yours.

1050
01:54:58,625 --> 01:55:04,250
Believe in him,
Guru Gobind Singh.
