1
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:38,663
What a beautiful bungalow

2
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,438
Gopal has painted very well

3
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,700
I told you to paint this bungalow

4
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:03,080
Instead of painting four lines you
are here only for four days

5
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:06,989
In two days this bungalow
is to be auctioned

6
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,962
By that time you need to finish
all the painting work

7
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:18,313
Seeing your speed of painting after
the auction only the work will finish

8
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:33,446
If I knew you would take
four days to paint this bungalow

9
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,446
Just because I knew about
the issues of this bungalow

10
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,355
I would have brought somebody else
and given him the job

11
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:56,627
Where did I keep my umbrella

12
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:58,416
It is here

13
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,862
Wveryone in the village is saying that
the bungalow is haunted by a ghost

14
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:13,567
In that why did you take that job

15
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:18,564
For mere five thousand rupees you
have spoiling your five days of sleep

16
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:21,338
Give me the key

17
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,977
I will return it the key where it
should belong

18
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,320
We didn't want this work anyway

19
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:31,954
Oh God!

20
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:37,273
Instead of locking it
I have left the key there only

21
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:40,538
What did you do?.

22
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:47,466
That watchman said he was going out of
town for four days so he gave the keys

23
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,883
What if somebody goes inside

24
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:50,757
Sir

25
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:54,197
Where had you gone instead
of finishing the work

26
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:55,940
And you want me to die also

27
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,505
Had gone for a tea, boss

28
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,495
Had you gone for tea or
to drink alcohol

29
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:02,792
Ok give me today's labor money

30
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,550
Take

31
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,248
Two hundred rupees

32
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:09,972
We had spoken one hundred and fifty
rupees a day

33
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:11,018
Why fifty rupees extra?.

34
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:13,010
He had gone in search of you
to that bungalow

35
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,718
he got terrified and has
left the key there only

36
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:19,759
You go with him to get the key
That's why I have given you extra fifty

37
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,657
Take it

38
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,422
To that house at this time

39
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:26,763
Wven if you give me one thousand also
I will not sleep in that direction

40
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,832
Did I ask you to go alone

41
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:31,903
Wven he will also come with you

42
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:35,038
Why are you talking senselessly?.

43
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:39,404
If you want you go with him
I will cover my self and sleep

44
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:42,910
No sleep! You only have to go since you
were greedy for five thousand rupees

45
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:10,392
Already somebody has opened
the door and gone inside

46
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:13,427
How do I take the key

47
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:44,849
people saying so many things about it

48
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,422
but why are you stubborn
about that bungalow

49
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:49,920
We are not going to live in that place

50
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:51,118
Then what do want do?.

51
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:56,090
It's a matter of prestige, All big bungalows
in this village are owned by us

52
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,630
Why should somebody else take
this bungalow

53
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,798
Out of fear nobody will
take that bungalow

54
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,665
So definitely that bungalow
will be ours

55
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:08,396
Did he want all this

56
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:13,604
From temple I'll get you a sacred thread
if you wear it all your fears will go

57
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:14,707
Why are you dying in fear

58
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:16,539
What dying?.
I'm already dead

59
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:18,877
Sir will you please give
me the bungalow's key

60
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:23,410
Last night you only open the door
and went inside the bungalow

61
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,677
It wasn't me

62
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:26,008
Wasn't it you!

63
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,752
Who was it then

64
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,392
Hi uncle aunty how are you?.

65
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,427
We are good

66
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:48,132
Come. Where is your mother and father

67
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:50,162
They are taking rest in Calcutta only

68
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,835
In this village I have got a contract
on the highway

69
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,803
It's a one year job till then
we both will stay here only

70
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,407
That's good stay in our house only

71
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:04,444
When you go to your job your wife can
be with your aunt, my daughters happily

72
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:07,041
But we are in different plan

73
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,842
What

74
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:12,715
There is old Palace bungalow here

75
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:14,849
which is going to be auctioned

76
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:18,319
We would like to buy it and
I with Ganga will stay there

77
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:21,624
See you don't know much about
that bungalow

78
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,916
People are afraid of going
near to that bungalow in day only

79
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,559
Its not suitable to stay there

80
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:31,958
See your uncle went there yesterday and
saw something of which he is in a shock

81
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,792
Was it yesterday

82
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,492
Yes, he had locked it but somebody
had opened the door and gone inside

83
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:39,437
It was us only

84
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,473
While coming on highway we saw
the bungalow

85
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,530
The door was open
we went inside to see who is inside

86
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,868
She was waiting outside

87
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:49,511
I went inside and saw the place
it's a beautiful place

88
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:52,804
We both have liked the place we
are taking that bungalow

89
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:56,048
Oh God, he is buy that place

90
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,408
Did you see, hearing that
bungalow's name only he ran away

91
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:02,780
And you are saying that
you want to take it

92
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:04,678
Uncle don't feel bad

93
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:07,582
This village is my mothers birth place

94
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,553
Taking a property here was my dream

95
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:13,354
Incase you want to take
property in this village only

96
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,519
I will show you a good place

97
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:17,660
But don't take that bungalow

98
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,695
Uncle we have like that
bungalow very much

99
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,831
We have decided to buy that bungalow

100
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:25,636
All village people are saying
that it is haunted by ghost

101
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:29,831
What uncle in this age also you
still believe in ghost, devil

102
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:31,634
Listen to your uncle s advice sir

103
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:34,965
I'm the watchman for that
bungalow from many years

104
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:39,443
Forty years ago zamindars
family used to stay there

105
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:42,909
There sons still stay in Delhi

106
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:46,951
They are auctioning the bungalow
only to get rid of it

107
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,581
Why do you want to take that bungalow
which has problems

108
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,822
If we take that watchman
you are the watchman

109
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,788
Don't worry we will not remove
from your job

110
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,984
I'Am not worried about going out

111
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,720
But you should not go in

112
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:32,025
God please protect them from any
harm for taking the bunglow

113
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,966
You only can save them God

114
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:40,870
Ramesh its already 7.30

115
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:42,973
We have to be there by
eight the priest has told me

116
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,446
What uncle always about time, astrology
you will be always like this only

117
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:47,971
The auction is at ten

118
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,511
Ok then you come afterwards
we will be go ahead

119
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:54,579
I will not hinder you,
you can go

120
00:12:54,953 --> 00:12:56,317
You bring them along with yourself

121
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:57,448
Come

122
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:19,863
What is this
Who are all these people

123
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,405
Who are you?.

124
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:29,271
Only uncles are here
the nephew is not to be seen

125
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:32,010
If we beat them here he
will leave the place

126
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,310
What do you want

127
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,973
Will you take that bungalow in auction?.

128
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,871
Will we leave you to take that?.

129
00:13:47,023 --> 00:13:49,318
Is there no man here to help us

130
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,623
Help us

131
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:54,623
If you shout will the hero
come and protect you

132
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:56,561
Hello Sir

133
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:58,898
You don't know who I am

134
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,335
And I don't know who you are

135
00:15:00,677 --> 00:15:02,699
I know who they are
but they don't know who I am

136
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:06,310
But one thing is sure that there
is some thing going on

137
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:09,245
When talking one shouldn't fight

138
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,844
and when fighting one shouldn't speak

139
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:16,348
This is correct

140
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:17,450
this also is correct

141
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:23,624
If you fight with someone smart and
young you will also get some thrill

142
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,920
Leaving that you are fighting with
an sweet biscuit and salt biscuit

143
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:33,024
Did I not tell you not to fight
while talking

144
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,458
Its our Vijay

145
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,471
How are you

146
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,508
Ramesh was saying that you wil
come and stay, but I did not believe

147
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,341
What you started fighting already

148
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,848
Just for fun

149
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:38,978
If I hadn't come on time those sweet
biscuit and salt biscuit would be dead

150
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:41,322
They are our uncles

151
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:45,851
Uncle he is my soul friend Vijay

152
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,990
He is not only your soul friend he saved
us also so he is soul friend of all

153
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,856
He is my big uncle and
he is my small uncle

154
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,394
He is a big psychtarist in Bangalore

155
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,193
He is to busy

156
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,632
He has come to our village for
ten days to take rest

157
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,837
Vijay have you really come
to take rest only

158
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,473
Ya really full rest and full meals

159
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,700
Don't lie, your mother has sent you
to marry a good simple village girl

160
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:15,311
If mother had liked I would have
got married long a ago

161
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,504
But what to do still the
right time hasn't come

162
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:19,738
When good times come
Good things happen

163
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:21,683
What this man hasn't
yet got married

164
00:18:22,287 --> 00:18:23,877
We have two daughters
who have to get married

165
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,146
What you said as a joke
he is taken seriously

166
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:31,882
he is already thinking that he has two
daughters who are not yet married

167
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:33,486
What uncle you are shocked?.

168
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:36,285
Will tell what exactly you are thinking?.

169
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:38,291
He is an expert mind reader

170
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,293
What will happen if he tells my secret

171
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,630
Doesn't your wife know what all you do

172
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:43,731
No problem I will tell it

173
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:49,768
Last week your husband was going to fair
in bus while sitting suddenly his leg

174
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:53,664
What is this?.
Nothing dear!

175
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:57,464
Last time didn't I go in bus to the fair
then to the temple he is telling that

176
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,541
Prayed to God he is telling about that
He is sayng about that. About that!

177
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:05,106
Oh! Ramesh, he is telling that it
is getting late for the auction

178
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:12,846
The govt rate for this bungalow
is one crore

179
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:16,288
One crore one time

180
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:18,920
One crore two time

181
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,186
One crore three time

182
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:41,139
I have kept the sofa set here

183
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:44,672
Hang that swing there

184
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:46,308
In the centre there

185
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:50,574
See Ramesh your mother is not at all
happy as you have taken this bungalow

186
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:55,373
She was scolding me, that why l
did not stop you from buying the house

187
00:19:55,686 --> 00:20:01,280
She has requested me to stay
with you till your work is finished

188
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,582
So we will all stay with you here

189
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,585
But there is only one condition

190
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:07,587
Condition?.

191
00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:12,853
Yes, You shouldn't go to the room
which is above the back stairs

192
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:16,157
You shouldn't go the room
facing to the south mainly

193
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:17,965
should never go!

194
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:23,756
You are all staying here we will listen
to you we will not even see that side

195
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:27,249
Is it OK

196
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,181
Ok

197
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:39,204
Because of him even I am supposed
to stay in this house

198
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:42,676
From now on I have to sleep
in morning only

199
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,122
Namaskara Sir

200
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:53,754
Sir why are you going in bullock cart

201
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,965
My friend has come from city
He wanted to ride in bullock cart

202
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,759
I am bored of going in car

203
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:01,162
It is good to go in bullock cart

204
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:03,367
What are you doing here

205
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:06,045
My grand daughter in flying the kites
with her friends

206
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:07,111
See there

207
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:54,152
This is not a bird
But still it flies

208
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:58,094
This is not a bull
But still has a horn

209
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:02,002
It has a tail
But its not a monkey

210
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:06,205
It's a kite, it's a kite

211
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:14,454
This is not a bird
But still it flies

212
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:17,957
This is not a bull
But still has a horn

213
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:22,227
It has a tail
But its not a monkey

214
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:25,741
It's a kite, it's a kite

215
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:04,228
The season is changing
lts bringing fresh air

216
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:12,583
The kite is leaving this earth,
lts thread is nice and strong

217
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,653
Let us strengthen the thread
Let us have fun

218
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:23,600
Let us open our minds
Let us fill it with colours

219
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,506
The kite is a symbol of progress

220
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:31,515
It's a kite, it's a kite

221
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:31,207
A kite sometimes will fall down
or bend towards the earth

222
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:39,149
Letting it go and catching it again is life

223
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:45,835
No matter how far it goes,
We should have control over life,

224
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,104
That's the lesson a kite teaches us

225
00:24:49,512 --> 00:24:53,450
One who forgets this is
lost and destroyed

226
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:26,096
Uncle why did big uncle ask us not
to go that room

227
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:28,770
What is there in that southern room

228
00:26:28,939 --> 00:26:29,905
I will tell you

229
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,778
Around one hundred and fifty years ago

230
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,514
A king called Vijayrajendra Bahadur
lived in this palace

231
00:26:37,787 --> 00:26:41,417
Once he had gone to Peddapuram
an town in Andhra Pradesh

232
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:47,465
He saw a dancer named Nagavalli he
liked her and brought her to the palace

233
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:51,835
She had a lover called Ramnath
he was also a dancer it seems

234
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:55,506
As soon as the king brought
Nagavalli here

235
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:01,417
Ramnath took a house on rent behind the
palace and used to stay there on weekend

236
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:08,491
Ramnath and Dadhavalli used to have
affair without the king knowing about it

237
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:12,232
During one Vijaya Dashmi festival the
king came to know about their affair

238
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:18,315
On that day only the king
burnt her to death

239
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,587
Thinking that the king is
still alive the soul of Nagavalli

240
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,864
To trouble the king, the soul is still
roaming there, is what all are saying

241
00:27:30,707 --> 00:27:33,608
The king consulting all the
astrolgers in lndia

242
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:35,906
King called famous Tantriks of the country

243
00:27:36,582 --> 00:27:42,386
Preformed prayers for sixty days and
lmprisoned the soul in the southern room

244
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:50,496
After some days the king committed suicide

245
00:27:50,806 --> 00:27:56,473
But still the soul of Nagavalli haunts
in that room only it seems

246
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:04,216
We don't know what is true and
what is false we can not make out

247
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:07,757
That's why Shiva has told that nobody
should go near that room only

248
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:14,502
One more thing the house which Ramnath
had rented for an affair with Nagavalli

249
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,677
now a dance professor lives there

250
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,361
What is his name?.

251
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:20,668
Mahadev

252
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:50,249
Why you can not come in the normal way,
you are opening the door with DTS effect

253
00:28:51,078 --> 00:28:52,814
As it is I am dying of the shock

254
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:56,232
I am afraid that is why I've come here

255
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:58,276
you are the one who scared us by
telling the story of Nagavalli

256
00:28:58,809 --> 00:28:59,659
Now you are scared?.

257
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:01,007
What do you want now?.
Nothing

258
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:04,069
I will sleep next to you here

259
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:08,409
You have wife can't you go and
sleep with her

260
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:12,820
My wife's face at night is more
horrible than the devil's face

261
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:15,083
Your face is much more horrible
when you are awake

262
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,362
You are joking know

263
00:29:17,562 --> 00:29:18,570
Am not joking I am serious

264
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:20,840
What do you think will the devil be tall
like Amitabh Bachan

265
00:29:20,988 --> 00:29:21,967
It will be like you to short

266
00:29:23,282 --> 00:29:25,806
Then have you seen the ghost

267
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:28,127
I haven't seen but have
knowledge about it

268
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,187
Come here

269
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,386
Ghost cannot be seen so easily
with the eyes

270
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:37,161
it can be seen to the dogs

271
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,747
They suddenly start howling

272
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:53,253
Winds start blowing fast

273
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:59,990
Trees and leaves start shaking

274
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:04,114
The doors of window starts
banging themselves

275
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,011
Somewhere you can smell the
jasmine flower

276
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:19,538
Father what is this

277
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,250
It's the anklets sound

278
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,027
Compared to this devil, the
devil in my room only is better

279
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,496
I am going

280
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:31,094
I will tell you one main thing

281
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:36,768
Before Ghost comes
You can see smoke

282
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:45,215
Who is that laughing?.

283
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:48,329
it is you!

284
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:52,061
Ya its me only
I don't know what you have studied

285
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:55,304
Seeing my grandfathers hanging clothes
you got scared thinking that's its ghost

286
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:58,413
I am not frightened

287
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:01,258
Simply!

288
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:02,934
Just for fun

289
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:04,065
Simply to terrify him

290
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:05,298
Your name

291
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,750
Soumiya

292
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:14,646
You short fellow,

293
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:16,758
Being in his company I also
became like him

294
00:31:18,864 --> 00:31:21,038
I won't sleep I will be awake only

295
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:37,830
What is this morning only

296
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:40,513
Didn't you get any other place to sing

297
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:43,697
Night we hear the anklets sound and
morning I hear your sound

298
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:45,403
You wont let us to sleep peacefully

299
00:31:46,936 --> 00:31:51,755
If you want to teach them go to
the river banks or to some temple

300
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:56,568
As long as I stay here if you trouble my
sleep with the sound of music

301
00:31:57,267 --> 00:32:00,158
Will tell Ramesh and throw you
and your grandfather out, be careful

302
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:03,543
Sir don't get angry I will tell her

303
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:04,924
That is it!

304
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:10,115
What if he tells should I stop
my music classes

305
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:12,741
I will definitely run the class

306
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:17,349
We are staying on there land
why should we fight with them only

307
00:32:17,964 --> 00:32:21,326
Its wrong to do what
they don't like

308
00:32:21,803 --> 00:32:23,333
Be quiet you won't understand
all this grand-dad

309
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:25,276
Start singing

310
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:44,215
Ganga

311
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:48,140
Ganga I know you are a mordern girl

312
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:51,449
You may have the curiosity to go into
that room

313
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:55,376
but it is good listen to elders advice
in these matters

314
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:57,021
Come

315
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:10,121
Who could it at this hour?.

316
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,521
Who is it?.

317
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,337
It is you?.

318
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,552
I was afraid, as to who it might be

319
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:18,398
What at this time

320
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:20,111
that to alone what is the matter

321
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,950
Nothing

322
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:26,881
Nothing, I was not feeling sleepy so
I came to sit out in some fresh air

323
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:30,190
Are you in love with someone

324
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:35,720
I know seeing your face
whats there in your mind

325
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:37,671
People who all are in love have
the same symptoms

326
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,023
They do not sleep at night aren't hungry
and do not know who is next to them

327
00:33:42,265 --> 00:33:45,245
They always feel like they have
lost something

328
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:47,447
Tell to me frankly

329
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,199
Who you are in love with?.

330
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:52,212
His name his Mahadev
he is a dance professor

331
00:33:52,453 --> 00:33:54,759
That is his house

332
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:57,839
Do you know him

333
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:02,066
Do I know him!?.

334
00:34:02,405 --> 00:34:05,511
I know everything and
also about everybody

335
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,196
Does Mahadev know that you love him

336
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,275
Yes

337
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:12,087
So what did he say

338
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:14,231
He told me to meet his
father and ask him

339
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,431
So tell

340
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:17,081
I am frightened

341
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:19,452
If you get frightened
How will you be successful in your love

342
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,462
What is your father's name?.
Shiva Anand

343
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:29,208
What sir your marrage-age daughter is
roaming at this time and your sleeping

344
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:31,718
Oh father has got up

345
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,782
You! what are you doing here at
this time instead of sleeping

346
00:34:37,928 --> 00:34:39,298

347
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,969

Love

352
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:01,208
Ramesh doesn't have a bit of sense

353
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:04,186
He has a unmarried friend to
stay here in the house

354
00:35:04,323 --> 00:35:07,127
I am suffering because I have a
daughters who are not yet married

355
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:11,249
I must some how throw him out

356
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:18,634
What is this grandfather

357
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:21,405
Children were supposed come at seven to
the class its ten they have not come

358
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:26,180
They will not come
There is no chance of coming also

359
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:30,709
Until I am here I will not let
them come here

360
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:36,055
Why are you seeing like that?.

361
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:40,364
I've given money to your students and
told them to go for a good kannada movie

362
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:44,526
I have asked them to learn what
is music and song from the movie

363
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:50,076
As there was no orchestra of yours l
could sleep without any tension till ten

364
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:54,340
Because you wanted to sleep
you spoiled my class

365
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:55,381
Yes

366
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,746
You think, students whom you are
teaching will become famous singers

367
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,018
M S Subbalakshmi, Vasanta Kumari,
Yesudas

368
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,422
I have no faith those who learn from you
will not even climb the stage

369
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:09,195
Whatever hurdles you give the
singing class will go on from tomorrow

370
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:10,429
And more better

371
00:36:10,973 --> 00:36:12,599
I didn't want you to thrown out

372
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:15,011
You only have decided to go

373
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:21,049
If my singing class is being
affected I don't want to stay here

374
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:28,251
Sir, Soumya's is an orphan
without her mother

375
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:34,126
Her mother died when she was born,
father married again and left

376
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:39,575
From that time I am her father
and mother till now

377
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:43,511
Other then me she has only
music to live for

378
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:48,414
She is only stuborn at times
otherwise she has heart of gold

379
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:52,148
I will make sure that until you go
that there won't be any classes

380
00:36:52,326 --> 00:36:54,054
That's better

381
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:25,394
Are you all right
Ya I am fine

382
00:37:26,072 --> 00:37:27,230
What is happening here

383
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,702
What sir, what do you think
about your self

384
00:37:31,078 --> 00:37:32,738
You might be close friend of Ramesh

385
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,014
You cannot act how ever you like

386
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:36,649
Uncle please

387
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:39,251
what happened that you are
shouting like this

388
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,013
What happened here?.

389
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,020
He just saved Ganga from falling

390
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,053
What is wrong

391
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,752
If there is suspicion in the
head what ever you see is wrong

392
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,759
If Duryodhana had suspected Karna there
wouldn't be any value to friendship only

393
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,599
My captain is also like that

394
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:55,398
He is also like Karna

395
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:58,757
Your uncle is talking logic you
are telling him mythology

396
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:01,622
Yesterday night he tried flirting
with my daughter

397
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:03,565
Now don't know whom he will flirt with

398
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,563
Let it be I will also see its just for
another six days

399
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:07,698
I will see

400
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:12,021
He is flirting with daughter and here
it is only six days more

401
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:15,058
He is already burning like fire why do
you want to add butter to it

402
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,157
Simply

403
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,284
Where did it go

404
00:38:35,956 --> 00:38:37,385
What are you searching?.

405
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:38,644
I am searching harmonium

406
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:40,347
Take this

407
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,008
What is this?.
It is saree

408
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,079
I am searching for harmonium
and you are giving me saree

409
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:49,643
Its not an ordinary saree
its silk saree

410
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:52,044
Is it silk saree?.

411
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,644
Its very good how much is this?.

412
00:38:56,115 --> 00:38:57,137
Three thousand

413
00:38:57,615 --> 00:39:00,340
Where did you get this much money

414
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:05,006
For people like us to take one
thing we should lose one thing

415
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:08,276
That harmonium was not worth
five hundred also

416
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:10,932
But Vijay brought it for
three thousand rupees

417
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:14,331
They have money and
we have only desires

418
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,867
I couldn't see you fighting with them so

419
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,566
If you have money do you
think you can buy anything

420
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:30,831
You can buy anything in money
but can you buy a mother

421
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,824
Music is also like that only
Mother and music are one and the same

422
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:37,555
You need to achieve in music

423
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:41,297
What do you think music is

424
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,122
It is only fun for you all

425
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,923
What do you know about music

426
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:51,350
I had heard that what happens if
a monkey gets a pearl, Now am seeing it

427
00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:55,516
Whatever he does it has a meaning

428
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:52,234
There is God in all the elements

429
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:57,433
She has mixed everything
without being seen

430
00:40:58,142 --> 00:41:03,094
In every forest,
there are different songs

431
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:09,367
In every river, there is a song

432
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:15,062
She is reciting varied tunes

433
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:12,209
There is song for birth
And song for death

434
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,744
Who wrote all this song?.

435
00:42:18,215 --> 00:42:23,905
In the depth of every heart
There are rhythms and tunes

436
00:42:24,146 --> 00:42:28,008
In this life

437
00:42:32,077 --> 00:42:35,131
In life and in flute

438
00:42:35,676 --> 00:42:39,730
In beauty and in love

439
00:42:41,074 --> 00:42:46,662
She is born, grows up, and blossoms
As rhythms and melody

440
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:37,512
The language understood by everyone

441
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:48,841
Music is not biased about humans

442
00:45:15,456 --> 00:45:17,387
What have you thought about my friend

443
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:23,007
There is no subject he doesn't know
lts better that everybody knows

444
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:28,375
He can concentrate at the same
times ten different subjects

445
00:45:28,718 --> 00:45:34,113
If anytime you ask about the ten subject
he will answer it, that is our captain

446
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:41,040
What are you seeing go out

447
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:54,337
You sang very well

448
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,869
I didn't know that you were well
versed in music

449
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:07,700
I've spoken rudely

450
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:10,663
You answered me with your song

451
00:46:10,772 --> 00:46:13,599
Please pardon me

452
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:41,020
Have you distributed my
email lD to all people

453
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,766
If there is any emergency I had
given your lD to my PA to message me

454
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:49,770
What happened

455
00:46:50,376 --> 00:46:52,472
One of your patient is in critical stage

456
00:46:52,649 --> 00:46:53,912
You need to go Bangalore it seems

457
00:46:57,998 --> 00:47:01,531
You had come here to take rest for
ten days still there is four days left

458
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:06,381
I can stay for forty days but will
my patient be alive till then

459
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,421
I was asked to come back
urgently that's why I am going?.

460
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:25,399
Very good he was supposed to stay for
ten days he is going within six days

461
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:27,538
Thank God

462
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:28,783
Ok

463
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:32,789
You are very happy that I am going
within six days instead of ten

464
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,538
I have already completed
my four days work

465
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:38,611
What?.

466
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:44,025
Vani did you tell your father about Love
which we spoke that night

467
00:47:44,132 --> 00:47:45,100
What?.

468
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:46,729
Love?

469
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:48,737
Yes, you only have to give permission

470
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:50,645
What guts you have

471
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:53,413
Tell about my daughter's love
in front of me only

472
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,895
What is the question of guts
to whom should we tell about love

473
00:47:57,103 --> 00:47:59,040
instead of you should we tell
Udaya Vani, Kannada prabha

474
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,939
Ramesha for that only we told you

475
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:05,351
When girls come to marrage age we
cannot keep people like him the in house

476
00:48:05,796 --> 00:48:06,821
Did you listen

477
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:11,100
He has the capacity to kill girls
only with his eyes

478
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:16,456
Using song and fight he already has
mesmerised everybody in six days

479
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:20,127
It is our good faith that he left our wifes'

480
00:48:20,605 --> 00:48:24,102
We would have cried,
for that atleast be happy

481
00:48:26,087 --> 00:48:31,226
You don't know his town, caste or who he
is he has just stayed here for a week

482
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:32,862
You are in love with him

483
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:36,813
Why are you acting so hastily

484
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:40,688
I said that your daughter is in
love did I tell that It was me

485
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:45,503
She is in love with professor dancer
Ramnath who stays behind this house

486
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,482
This girl loves him

487
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:51,884
That night this was what Vani told me

488
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:54,030
Next morning I met that boy

489
00:48:54,337 --> 00:48:57,310
He has told that he will marry
only after you give your blessings

490
00:48:57,613 --> 00:49:01,681
please for any reason don't
say no to them

491
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:04,125
Wven if you search also you
won't get such a boy

492
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:06,965
Get them married and don't
forget to call me for the marriage

493
00:49:07,342 --> 00:49:09,711
If you want for your second daughter

494
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:11,646
Please you go

495
00:49:15,197 --> 00:49:16,665
Why is he seeing

496
00:49:17,003 --> 00:49:19,874
He is a super actor
editing master

497
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:26,320
Madam why do you frighten your husband

498
00:49:26,665 --> 00:49:30,733
While sleeping your face is frightening
your husband was telling me

499
00:49:31,044 --> 00:49:33,174
Your husband is already frightened
why do you frighten him again

500
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:35,846
Why sleeping smear your face
with ash and sleep

501
00:49:36,693 --> 00:49:39,757
If my wife smears ash and sleeps
she smells like a dead corpse

502
00:49:40,037 --> 00:49:41,027
Sir this to much

503
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:44,382
You shouldn't think like that
about your wife

504
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:46,753
Boss

505
00:49:47,258 --> 00:49:49,695
I salute you do not tell anything more

506
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,936
Shouldn't I tell what you were thinking

507
00:49:56,718 --> 00:49:58,049
What is that?.

508
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:07,942
What your uncle if does like that in
front of me will I leave him

509
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:09,279
Whole family is only

510
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:11,687
One minute,

511
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,796
What is this?. Sweet chapathi

512
00:50:15,006 --> 00:50:17,409
What karanatka famous is for is in my bag

513
00:50:17,879 --> 00:50:19,745
Why are you looking so dull

514
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:21,818
You tell one thing and do another thing

515
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:25,257
What to do our profession
is only like that

516
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:29,139
All my patients are waiting for me

517
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,074
Ok when will you come again

518
00:50:31,553 --> 00:50:33,524
Will go like this and come like that

519
00:50:34,328 --> 00:50:36,424
Don't believe him

520
00:50:39,075 --> 00:50:40,941
Why are you looking so dull
is that because am going?.

521
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,311
Simply I joked

522
00:50:43,856 --> 00:50:47,422
See I want the place where
I will live happily

523
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:49,800
That's why I was with you very friendly

524
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,212
If I have hurt you please forgive me
I won't say like this

525
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:55,918
I want you to remember me

526
00:50:56,158 --> 00:50:57,216
Shall I go

527
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:21,020
Soumya Vijay has given you a present

528
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:23,224
What present

529
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,532
It is inside go and see

530
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:50,410
There was problem in the
harmonium I've rectified it

531
00:51:50,617 --> 00:51:56,156
Now you can sing loudly
with your students

532
00:52:12,615 --> 00:52:15,679
What are you doing?.
I came searching for you only

533
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:18,587
Me, what is the matter?.

534
00:52:18,766 --> 00:52:22,229
Soumya I don't want you
address me as mam

535
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:24,442
Not like that you are our
master's wife

536
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:26,675
So what treat me as your friend

537
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:29,058
you don't have to so formal

538
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:32,134
OK Ganga

539
00:52:32,305 --> 00:52:33,273
Tell me whats the matter

540
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,419
Soumya I have some important books
And I cant keep it here and there

541
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:41,459
I am planning to keep it at
the room above the stairs

542
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:45,005
I swear on my grandfather I've
not even once gone up

543
00:52:45,276 --> 00:52:47,747
There is some problem there it seems

544
00:52:48,151 --> 00:52:49,643
They have performed a puja
and locked the door

545
00:52:49,855 --> 00:52:51,415
Wven my grandfather has asked me
to not to go there

546
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:54,158
Ok leave that room lets
search for another room

547
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:57,543
But in bungalow uncle and aunty
are there how is it possible

548
00:52:57,846 --> 00:53:02,085
Now all have gone, to the professor's
house for Vani s marriage talks

549
00:53:02,226 --> 00:53:03,420
This is only the correct time

550
00:53:03,897 --> 00:53:07,030
I haven't fallen in love with Vani
seeing her beauty or her property

551
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,668
It's just because seeing your
joint family

552
00:53:10,082 --> 00:53:13,317
From my birth I studied in hostel,
and grew up alone

553
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:18,368
Seeing your family even I desired
to be part of your family

554
00:53:19,443 --> 00:53:20,706
What about your parents

555
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:25,251
Two years ago they met with car accident
and left me alone and went

556
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:26,553
Now I am alone

557
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,828
From now you are not alone

558
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:34,506
We have liked you very much
We want you become our son in law

559
00:53:34,787 --> 00:53:36,814
For all this Dr Vijay is the main reason

560
00:53:37,461 --> 00:53:39,796
Hope he gets married soon

561
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:43,068
When we are talking about marrage,
why him do you want to talk about him

562
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:45,443
Be quiet, If he wasn't there would
we have got this alliance?.

563
00:53:45,786 --> 00:53:46,844
Just shut up

564
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,685
Nothing son in law

565
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:53,503
We were just discussing when to keep
the engagement and marriage

566
00:54:38,607 --> 00:54:41,191
This must be that room

567
00:54:41,693 --> 00:54:43,192
They tied this much of sacred threads

568
00:54:43,432 --> 00:54:48,804
From one hundred and fifty years ago
Nagavalli's soul is kept in this room

569
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,169
This is that room

570
00:54:51,476 --> 00:54:52,941
That's all false

571
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:55,142
It might be that all the kings treasure
have been kept here

572
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:58,365
Not only that there laws also
would be here

573
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:01,485
So that nobody can rob it
they might have told like this

574
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:06,176
Then all devil, ghost are
all false stories

575
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:09,819
If I had the room keys I would have
opened and shown you immediately

576
00:55:10,158 --> 00:55:11,991
They had lost the key long ago

577
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:16,653
My grandfather once told me our village
locksmith has a duplicate set of the key

578
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:18,195
Shall we ask him to give one
more key

579
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:20,104
Ya you are the owner of this bungalow

580
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:22,790
You ask him to get it done
I will stand there only and get it done

581
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:26,731
I will ask him now only to make it

582
00:55:39,642 --> 00:55:42,304
See this

583
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:10,310
Sir

584
00:56:13,388 --> 00:56:17,347
If I hadn't seen this lorry a great
mishap would have occurred

585
00:58:31,872 --> 00:58:34,636
Don't open that door
Why?.

586
00:58:35,544 --> 00:58:39,708
The locksmith who gave us the key
has been found dead

587
00:58:43,722 --> 00:58:45,690
Please don't open that door

588
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,755
The person who made the
key only is dead

589
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:54,491
I brought the key so I am terrified
what will happen to me

590
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:03,311
When I went to ask him the make
the key he was to drunk

591
00:59:03,548 --> 00:59:06,483
If he is drinking twenty four
hours he has to die vomiting blood

592
00:59:06,786 --> 00:59:11,621
We got the key done and he died it's
just an accident

593
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,248
Don't take all this into your mind

594
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:14,967
Be strong

595
00:59:22,985 --> 00:59:25,624
I have told everybody not to go up

596
00:59:26,138 --> 00:59:29,452
She has not only gone up and also
opened the door of that haunted room

597
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:33,435
That's why the locksmith is dead

598
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:37,963
Uncle everybody knows that he
died due to excessive drinking

599
00:59:38,613 --> 00:59:41,859
They have written it in the
medical report

600
00:59:42,034 --> 00:59:44,879
Don't link one thing to another
and get tensed

601
00:59:45,555 --> 00:59:49,476
If anything was to happen it
should've happened to Ganga

602
00:59:49,949 --> 00:59:51,651
Because she is the one who
opened the door

603
00:59:51,928 --> 00:59:52,921
She is OK

604
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,717
We are going to stay here happily
in this house

605
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,105
If you are afraid you can go

606
01:00:00,344 --> 01:00:01,279
How is it possible

607
01:00:01,955 --> 01:00:07,317
to leave you both and go at this time
I am disheartened

608
01:00:08,024 --> 01:00:10,699
You might not believe in my words

609
01:00:11,176 --> 01:00:16,800
Don't know what might all happen
at this bungalow now

610
01:02:43,766 --> 01:02:47,617
Sing a song

611
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:51,166
Who is that

612
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:56,397
Nagavalli

613
01:04:15,957 --> 01:04:18,562
Ramesh somebody is knocking the door

614
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,208
Who is it?.

615
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:28,555
Workers have seen something they
have got terrified and are shouting

616
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:31,273
Where?. In the kitchen

617
01:04:34,602 --> 01:04:35,630
Why is she trembling like that

618
01:04:35,944 --> 01:04:36,604
What happened here

619
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:39,361
Some lady wearing anklets
went like a ghost it seems

620
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:40,661
with anklets?.

621
01:04:41,074 --> 01:04:41,667
Ghost?.

622
01:05:03,443 --> 01:05:06,987
Ramesh suddenly all started
breaking by it self

623
01:05:13,437 --> 01:05:15,035
Who hired you all for work

624
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:17,820
Your uncle told so Soumya
kept us for work

625
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:21,749
Yes Sir

626
01:05:23,598 --> 01:05:27,278
See there's nothing like ghost or
devil its all lies

627
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,726
Don't believe anything

628
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:40,593
What Soumya

629
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:41,865
What are you doing here at this time?.

630
01:05:42,278 --> 01:05:45,020
I heard some sound so I came

631
01:05:48,784 --> 01:05:52,258
See don't worry about what
happened here

632
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:08,492
You are his PA right somehow
trace him and inform him

633
01:06:10,515 --> 01:06:13,395
I've already called eight times

634
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:14,469
Where has he gone

635
01:06:14,706 --> 01:06:19,529
See their is a problem has arisen
which he has to solve

636
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:23,552
We didn't need him he was here
Now we need him, he is not to be found

637
01:06:25,237 --> 01:06:29,192
Trace him and send him to my house

638
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:37,197
What is this?.

639
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:38,040
How did this happen

640
01:06:40,195 --> 01:06:40,925
Tell Ganga

641
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:44,812
I don't know suddenly it caught fire

642
01:06:45,025 --> 01:06:46,556
How is it possible

643
01:06:46,734 --> 01:06:47,705
I don't know

644
01:06:48,043 --> 01:06:50,854
If you want you can ask Soumya
she was also here only

645
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:52,600
Was only soumya here

646
01:06:54,012 --> 01:06:55,577
Wven I don't know

647
01:06:56,024 --> 01:06:58,194
Suddenly I caught fire

648
01:07:00,819 --> 01:07:01,881
Nothing has happened
to you right

649
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:17,647
Who is that?.

650
01:07:20,873 --> 01:07:21,466
Ya Captain

651
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:23,924
What are you doing?.

652
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,290
Is this the case which you told me

653
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:27,340
He is to violent

654
01:07:27,816 --> 01:07:30,856
You let all these people out tie him
with a chain

655
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:32,435
What you are going to tie me
up with a chain

656
01:07:32,812 --> 01:07:34,845
He is my small uncle
He is perfectly alright

657
01:07:35,127 --> 01:07:39,814
He doesn't seem to be alright
in any place

658
01:07:40,091 --> 01:07:42,331
Why are you frightened seeing him

659
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:44,582
From yesterday night my time
is not right

660
01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:46,856
I'm seeing only ghosts

661
01:07:47,032 --> 01:07:50,140
I saw a cat which was meowing
I was scared

662
01:07:50,554 --> 01:07:52,896
I went near Soumya
I was frightened there also

663
01:07:53,271 --> 01:07:56,253
I saw him he has come in
various colours

664
01:07:57,427 --> 01:07:59,404
That's ok. When did you come

665
01:08:01,051 --> 01:08:03,188
I've been searching all over the
world trying to contact you

666
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,599
What is this new get up

667
01:08:06,013 --> 01:08:07,486
I had gone to Shabari-male for praying

668
01:08:08,093 --> 01:08:11,304
then I came to Pampe, my PA told
me you were searching for me

669
01:08:18,756 --> 01:08:20,057
Does he have a problem

670
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:25,157
Oh God last time he stayed for six
days we couldn't tolerate him

671
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:27,167
I don't know how many days
he is going to be here

672
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:30,287
Until your disease is solved I won't go

673
01:08:30,461 --> 01:08:31,797
What disease

674
01:08:32,172 --> 01:08:34,674
What immediately you've started
troubling him

675
01:08:35,122 --> 01:08:38,368
Uncle now as captain has come

676
01:08:38,645 --> 01:08:41,456
I will also see what
he will look after

677
01:08:43,776 --> 01:08:47,594
First only your uncle is an tensed
man after all this problems

678
01:08:47,732 --> 01:08:50,234
He would be more tensed

679
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:57,846
I will treat you

680
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,503
I will correct you

681
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:03,658
What will you correct me

682
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:08,251
What you will correct me
I will correct my self

683
01:09:09,934 --> 01:09:11,636
None of them have the problem

684
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:14,313
Then who has it, Soumya

685
01:09:16,976 --> 01:09:20,256
See get ready I will
then tell you everything

686
01:09:20,363 --> 01:09:22,271
Where is your better half

687
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:25,021
Ganga Sis

688
01:09:29,182 --> 01:09:30,483
Where did she go

689
01:10:23,277 --> 01:10:24,144
Where are you

690
01:10:24,317 --> 01:10:25,116
What happened to you

691
01:10:33,404 --> 01:10:34,877
Somebody help me

692
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:36,148
Don't come near me

693
01:10:55,203 --> 01:10:57,545
Ramesh sound is coming from this room

694
01:11:00,568 --> 01:11:01,298
What in this room?.

695
01:11:01,542 --> 01:11:03,414
If somebody is there he will
die due to suffocation only

696
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,212
What happened

697
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:40,531
When I was going up

698
01:11:40,878 --> 01:11:43,827
I felt like somebody was
coming behind me

699
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,778
I got frightened and
started running

700
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:49,424
Wven that thing followed me

701
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:53,378
Felling frightened I went in that room

702
01:11:54,528 --> 01:11:57,602
Somebody locked it from outside

703
01:11:57,848 --> 01:12:00,922
I don't know who locked me

704
01:12:01,337 --> 01:12:03,337
Why had you gone up

705
01:12:03,582 --> 01:12:06,324
I had gone I search in search of Ganga

706
01:12:06,568 --> 01:12:08,338
Who told you that Ganga is up

707
01:12:09,787 --> 01:12:10,883
Soumya told you

708
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:14,942
But she saw me taking bath

709
01:12:16,495 --> 01:12:18,598
Why did she tell like that

710
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:26,443
You saw what happened to vani now

711
01:12:26,722 --> 01:12:28,825
These incidents have been happening
at this bungalow

712
01:12:30,445 --> 01:12:32,512
I don't know who and why they
are doing it

713
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:33,795
I don't know what they want

714
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:35,094
I cannot understand anything

715
01:12:35,408 --> 01:12:36,709
Did you know anything

716
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:41,131
I'm serious and you are laughing

717
01:12:41,814 --> 01:12:45,963
The first time I came here
was not for rest

718
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:49,181
When you called me and said that
you are taking this bungalow

719
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:52,609
I remembered that I had heard
about this bungalow somewhere

720
01:12:52,847 --> 01:12:56,196
Then I remembered that one person
has written about this bungalow

721
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:02,461
From a library I referred and studied,
books then I told you that I will come

722
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,798
As long as I stayed here they
weren't any problem

723
01:13:08,107 --> 01:13:11,855
At night times after everybody had slept
even I had gone up and checked it

724
01:13:12,634 --> 01:13:14,942
There was nothing there

725
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:22,317
After you opened the Nagavalli's
room I think all problem have arisen

726
01:13:26,921 --> 01:13:30,201
Don't worry I will solve all
your problems

727
01:13:31,314 --> 01:13:32,044
Be brave

728
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:35,768
I have brought sweets from Shabarimale

729
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:37,307
First come let's give it to everybody

730
01:13:42,783 --> 01:13:45,057
I had kept the sweets bag
here it's not to be seen

731
01:14:00,323 --> 01:14:05,010
I won't leave them
who have destroyed my bag

732
01:14:05,386 --> 01:14:08,163
We will see who will win

733
01:14:08,336 --> 01:14:09,534
We will see

734
01:14:11,388 --> 01:14:15,468
Take this money you and your
granddaughter must leave this place now

735
01:14:15,883 --> 01:14:18,957
No sir I don't want this money

736
01:14:19,102 --> 01:14:21,342
If you want I will the job and go

737
01:14:22,019 --> 01:14:27,140
How can I go now when you are
suspecting my granddaughter

738
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:33,112
You are all saying that she
is haunted by ghost

739
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:39,082
So until she is cleared in
that matter how can I go?.

740
01:14:41,168 --> 01:14:42,332
Who is telling lies

741
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:46,968
When Ganga's sari caught fire, only
Soumya was there is that lie

742
01:14:47,105 --> 01:14:52,260
She knew that Ganga had gone to take
bath she sent Vani up is that also lie

743
01:14:52,605 --> 01:14:56,456
If she is still here I am afraid
what all might happen

744
01:14:56,662 --> 01:15:00,846
See take this money and
get lost from here

745
01:15:01,392 --> 01:15:04,535
Please don't send them
out of this bungalow

746
01:15:04,744 --> 01:15:05,840
Ganga! Yes uncle

747
01:15:06,455 --> 01:15:10,639
If I hadn't asked Soumya to get the key
They wouldn't have faced any problems

748
01:15:10,915 --> 01:15:12,720
This is all my fault,
If you want punish me

749
01:15:13,195 --> 01:15:14,566
But don't send them out uncle

750
01:15:16,147 --> 01:15:19,413
Ramesh at least you tell uncle
not to send them out

751
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,188
Let Soumya be here uncle

752
01:15:22,325 --> 01:15:23,815
captain will look to it that there
won't be any problem

753
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:32,465
I know who will solve this problem

754
01:15:32,742 --> 01:15:34,641
I will call them here only

755
01:16:25,932 --> 01:16:26,921
Who is that

756
01:16:32,544 --> 01:16:33,703
Who is that

757
01:16:34,414 --> 01:16:35,403
It is me

758
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,150
Why are you hiding behind the
door come out

759
01:16:38,354 --> 01:16:40,482
I came to check whether you
are in your room or not

760
01:16:40,725 --> 01:16:42,660
At night times where should l
go instead of being in my room

761
01:16:43,029 --> 01:16:45,931
You will be in your room only
But I had clear my doubts

762
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,429
First stand in front of me and
talk properly

763
01:16:52,478 --> 01:16:54,673
I am your enemy
No no am your friend

764
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:56,371
Not singer doctor

765
01:16:56,652 --> 01:17:00,612
See I am happy that you've come
back but if you want to talk to me

766
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:01,883
Shall I come after two hours

767
01:17:01,994 --> 01:17:04,462
You should come only in day
light not at night times

768
01:17:05,066 --> 01:17:05,963
That side

769
01:17:20,793 --> 01:17:22,728
Don't mistake me

770
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:26,934
I heard anklets sound I was
checking if you've worn anklets or not

771
01:17:28,973 --> 01:17:31,271
Am I a small girl to wear anklets

772
01:17:31,378 --> 01:17:35,248
Not only small girls but also
devils have anklets in their legs

773
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:37,978
Oh God

774
01:17:38,623 --> 01:17:42,253
e told what I was thinking in my mind

775
01:18:31,046 --> 01:18:33,344
Come on

776
01:18:33,817 --> 01:18:39,485
Let's have passionate love
Come on

777
01:18:42,599 --> 01:18:47,938
Take me in your arms just once
Fulfill all my desires

778
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:17,621
Father

779
01:19:18,026 --> 01:19:19,322
What is this

780
01:19:19,595 --> 01:19:20,754
It is a presentation

781
01:19:21,365 --> 01:19:22,023
Who gave

782
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:23,624
Ghost

783
01:19:24,002 --> 01:19:28,269
Last when you came I was
trembling with fear of ghost

784
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:31,778
Now you've come like a ghost
in the midnight

785
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,715
Aren't you afraid of ghost

786
01:19:34,988 --> 01:19:38,982
Fear! Ghost! me?.

787
01:19:45,472 --> 01:19:49,011
I am not afraid, There's
nothing like devilish and ghostish

788
01:19:49,825 --> 01:19:55,509
All don't exist, Go idiot!

789
01:20:00,777 --> 01:20:05,960
We are all frightened about one
telegu person now we have two

790
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:23,839
Why are you sleeping here

791
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:27,758
Last night it became to late while
coming from the concert

792
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:28,972
That's why I slept here

793
01:20:29,309 --> 01:20:30,243
Concert?.

794
01:20:30,582 --> 01:20:31,207
Singing concert

795
01:20:31,352 --> 01:20:34,627
Anyway does anybody learn
music here at night

796
01:20:34,768 --> 01:20:36,501
Who learns music here

797
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:39,176
Only in the morning Soumya teaches
children music that is all

798
01:20:40,964 --> 01:20:43,532
Then in the night I heard music

799
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:45,308
Somebody was dancing wearing anklets

800
01:20:45,419 --> 01:20:46,251
Who was it

801
01:20:46,423 --> 01:20:47,860
Dance with anklets?. Yes

802
01:20:48,231 --> 01:20:51,038
Did you really hear the anklets sound?.

803
01:20:51,144 --> 01:20:51,942
Yes

804
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:54,212
Ya really, I went up tried to
open the door

805
01:20:54,393 --> 01:20:55,589
It was latched from inside

806
01:20:55,765 --> 01:20:56,757
Its highly impossible

807
01:20:57,005 --> 01:20:59,949
Because from the day I opened the
door nobody has gone there

808
01:21:00,086 --> 01:21:01,020
Is it?. Yes

809
01:21:01,693 --> 01:21:05,436
Then you think that what music
I heard that it might be a dream,

810
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:07,314
Might be

811
01:21:07,486 --> 01:21:08,717
Might be

812
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:12,742
I will drink coffee later, First lets go
and see what is there in that room

813
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:13,973
I won't come

814
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,284
Only once I had gone and lt
created a huge problem

815
01:21:16,428 --> 01:21:17,362
Its ok come I am with you

816
01:21:17,835 --> 01:21:19,134
Come let us see

817
01:21:22,188 --> 01:21:24,789
See didn't I tell you,
that its not latched

818
01:21:25,169 --> 01:21:26,103
Yes

819
01:21:26,778 --> 01:21:27,403
It is not latched

820
01:21:32,369 --> 01:21:34,137
Is this the room with the problem
which Ramesh told me

821
01:21:34,379 --> 01:21:35,211
Yes

822
01:21:42,014 --> 01:21:43,747
Is he the king

823
01:21:43,957 --> 01:21:44,549
Yes

824
01:21:44,894 --> 01:21:47,369
Seeing his face we can tell
this person is not good

825
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:50,406
Ok where is the otherside
Nagavalli

826
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,386
Come
This is her

827
01:22:08,571 --> 01:22:12,349
There is no fault of the
king in killing her

828
01:22:12,556 --> 01:22:13,319
Why?.

829
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:16,370
See her eyes her body structure

830
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:23,033
What can the king do, if a beautiful
lady like her has affair

831
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:25,369
Why King?. Anybody else also
would have done the same thing

832
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:28,720
Come I will show you the house
where the dancer Ramnath stayed

833
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:30,996

883
01:26:49,944 --> 01:26:50,936
This is my decision

884
01:26:54,532 --> 01:26:56,334
Some pandit it seems

885
01:26:56,508 --> 01:26:58,847
He is going to try on us
what all he has learnt

886
01:27:00,492 --> 01:27:05,068
All are cheating us saying
devil and ghost

887
01:27:05,416 --> 01:27:07,947
For all this I have to pay the fine

888
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:13,443
You shouldn't speak ill about anyone
when you don't know about him

889
01:27:13,616 --> 01:27:17,322
Ramachandra shastry is not what you think

890
01:27:17,464 --> 01:27:22,381
He has the powers to kill the evil
powers, with good powers, I've heard

891
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,314
Its good that he is coming here

892
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:42,689
Welcome

893
01:27:42,935 --> 01:27:45,639
Please sir, come inside

894
01:27:56,991 --> 01:28:00,492
There is one problem definitely here

895
01:28:00,907 --> 01:28:03,005
Put the chair facing to the east

896
01:28:10,614 --> 01:28:16,090
One more important thing until I finish
my work nobody is to leave

897
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:19,138
One more thing

898
01:28:19,549 --> 01:28:22,857
My food will be prepared by my
assistants only

899
01:28:23,096 --> 01:28:26,039
I won't even drink a drop of water here

900
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:42,127
Who is this man

901
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:47,543
Some psychiatrist it seems, he doesn't
have anywork so he has brought him here

902
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,346
Psychiatrist?.

903
01:28:49,698 --> 01:28:51,702
where is my room

904
01:28:51,963 --> 01:28:54,096
Show him his room

905
01:28:54,227 --> 01:28:58,154
Please come sir in this house
neither I can sleep in day nor at night

906
01:28:58,821 --> 01:29:00,216
Body is fully tired

907
01:29:00,386 --> 01:29:03,677
Please give those devils the gate pass

908
01:29:15,569 --> 01:29:18,530
Did you hear what did pundit say

909
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:21,127
That I won't sit there,
I will sit here only

910
01:29:21,663 --> 01:29:24,090
That I wont drink water, I wont eat here

911
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:28,119
Its wrong to speak about something
which we don't know about it

912
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:33,976
These people will be very
carefull about everything

913
01:29:34,115 --> 01:29:37,871
Otherwise negative energy will get
formed to them and will create a problem

914
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:42,004
Our ancestors haven't done
anything without a reason

915
01:29:42,307 --> 01:29:44,099
Its just that we don't know the reason
that is the problem

916
01:29:44,437 --> 01:29:48,625
We are leaving in twenty first
century so you believe in all this

917
01:29:49,231 --> 01:29:52,249
So what if I am an psychiatrist
don't you believe in God

918
01:29:53,193 --> 01:29:55,553
We believe in God much more
than others do

919
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:57,520
Let it be doctor or anybody

920
01:29:58,353 --> 01:30:01,212
There are somthings which
keep on occuring

921
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:02,936
There are some things which
shouldn't be questioned

922
01:30:03,249 --> 01:30:05,006
It would be wrong

923
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:09,466
We come across so many things but
experience cannot be explained

924
01:30:09,975 --> 01:30:11,495
An experience can only be experienced

925
01:30:11,872 --> 01:30:15,390
If today technology has developed
its just because of knowledge

926
01:30:15,602 --> 01:30:19,256
If knowledge is an tree, then
technology is its branch it is told

927
01:30:19,365 --> 01:30:24,722
All the research is capable just
because of our ancestors

928
01:30:30,219 --> 01:30:32,737
We cannot they were wrong
and we are right

929
01:30:33,048 --> 01:30:34,738
I don't know, I don't understand

930
01:30:35,046 --> 01:30:38,007
I've had faith in you as far as my
I know my problems must be solved

931
01:30:39,276 --> 01:30:41,896
Let them do their work
we will do our work

932
01:30:43,372 --> 01:30:48,475
Oh God Anjaneya somehow solve
our bungalow problem

933
01:30:49,913 --> 01:30:53,385
If you come with me I will
solve all of your problems

934
01:30:53,588 --> 01:30:55,043
Is that the God talking

935
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,382
I spoke

936
01:30:59,752 --> 01:31:03,456
If you take me to the places I say
all your problems will get solved

937
01:31:03,698 --> 01:31:04,562
Will you take me

938
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:05,833
Definitely take you

939
01:31:06,074 --> 01:31:08,479
But you have to be with me

940
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:10,043
That only time will say

941
01:31:30,089 --> 01:31:34,090
Nobody can stop the time

942
01:31:34,605 --> 01:31:38,743
No one can capture air

943
01:31:39,722 --> 01:31:43,860
You from me
And me from you

944
01:31:44,172 --> 01:31:47,876
Is not possible to separate us

945
01:32:45,716 --> 01:32:50,561
Why do we need a city?.

946
01:32:50,734 --> 01:32:55,203
Why do we need a house?.

947
01:32:55,751 --> 01:32:57,950
Where ever we are it our city

948
01:32:58,194 --> 01:33:03,233
We are not obligated to anyone.
Our life is full of joy.

949
01:33:05,084 --> 01:33:09,325
I'm thief who steals hearts

950
01:33:09,466 --> 01:33:13,878
I'm the Shorty who kicks' injustice out

951
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:18,252
If we come together and stand

952
01:33:18,932 --> 01:33:22,843
Who can be our opposition?.

953
01:34:13,421 --> 01:34:18,232
We can't hear anything

954
01:34:19,074 --> 01:34:22,848
We don't want anything

955
01:34:23,188 --> 01:34:25,753
Our friendship is God for us

956
01:34:26,131 --> 01:34:27,931
We can't see anyone else

957
01:34:28,205 --> 01:34:32,343
Who is as good as us?.

958
01:34:32,888 --> 01:34:36,833
Let this never end

959
01:34:37,169 --> 01:34:41,410
Let this journey continue

960
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:44,119
Let us live happily like this

961
01:34:44,461 --> 01:34:46,261
Let us march ahead togeather

962
01:34:46,668 --> 01:34:50,579
Together forever

963
01:36:12,365 --> 01:36:13,333
Its not me

964
01:36:19,856 --> 01:36:20,846
I do not know anything

965
01:36:21,195 --> 01:36:24,535
How it fell down really I do not know

966
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:30,528
You only pushed it and now
you are acting

967
01:36:31,002 --> 01:36:32,015
No

968
01:36:32,332 --> 01:36:33,512
I didn't really push it

969
01:36:34,083 --> 01:36:35,405
If you didn't push how
did it fall, by it self

970
01:36:37,444 --> 01:36:39,398
Why had you gone up?.

971
01:36:39,824 --> 01:36:43,135
Coffee had spilled so aunty
told to wipe the floor

972
01:36:43,402 --> 01:36:44,469
That's why I had gone up

973
01:36:45,364 --> 01:36:46,462
I'm speaking the truth

974
01:36:46,598 --> 01:36:49,251
I didn't push it

975
01:36:49,383 --> 01:36:53,591
You are not doing
The devil inside you is doing it

976
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,534
Really I didn't push it

977
01:36:56,664 --> 01:37:00,697
After this it's not good I will leave
Soumya outside

978
01:37:02,091 --> 01:37:04,101
Ganga please ask them to leave me

979
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:09,430
Please believe me

980
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:15,871
If you don't believe my words
Kill me

981
01:37:16,048 --> 01:37:19,610
Please don't put false
charges on me

982
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:20,916
Please don't do anything to her

983
01:37:22,896 --> 01:37:24,192
Listen to me Sir

984
01:37:27,371 --> 01:37:29,032
Nothing as happened to
her as you all think

985
01:37:29,609 --> 01:37:33,172
If you put false charges on
her who will marry her

986
01:37:40,899 --> 01:37:41,888
Whose anklet is that

987
01:37:47,211 --> 01:37:48,701
How did it come here

988
01:37:48,915 --> 01:37:50,644
I don't know whose it is

989
01:37:50,885 --> 01:37:53,218
I found it when I was cleaning the house

990
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:04,609
Please let me outside

991
01:38:07,184 --> 01:38:10,815
Don't worry I've given her a
treatment

992
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:23,346
Ramesh you have to be very cautious

993
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:26,243
I had gone to temple and
checked the planets

994
01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:30,328
It showed that there was
trouble for him only

995
01:38:31,933 --> 01:38:34,664
What you are telling is true

996
01:38:34,805 --> 01:38:38,937
Few minutes ago soumya tried killing
him by pushing the fish tank

997
01:38:39,882 --> 01:38:40,643
Where is soumya

998
01:38:41,151 --> 01:38:43,382
He has locked her in her room

999
01:38:43,757 --> 01:38:46,625
Its good that she has been locked

1000
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:06,834
I will leave the house and go now only

1001
01:39:06,969 --> 01:39:08,994
Please leave my grand daughter

1002
01:39:09,408 --> 01:39:15,181
Shastry has said until the problem
is solved nobody can go out

1003
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,082
So nobody can leave

1004
01:39:17,456 --> 01:39:19,857
Nothing has happened to
my granddaughter

1005
01:39:20,195 --> 01:39:23,165
You can tie me here

1006
01:39:23,435 --> 01:39:25,027
Please don't spoil her life

1007
01:39:25,205 --> 01:39:27,731
Swamy I will leave your granddaughter

1008
01:39:27,844 --> 01:39:29,436
Will you send her to the temple

1009
01:39:29,915 --> 01:39:30,778
OK Sir

1010
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:36,223
Go with Soumya to the temple
and perform puja

1011
01:39:36,494 --> 01:39:37,461
Now Peace is important

1012
01:39:37,796 --> 01:39:38,785
Why should I go

1013
01:39:38,999 --> 01:39:40,762
She tried killing you right

1014
01:39:41,071 --> 01:39:41,764
You only have to go

1015
01:39:42,006 --> 01:39:44,100
Take her now only

1016
01:39:45,946 --> 01:39:47,003
Ok as you have told me to take to her
I will go

1017
01:40:13,435 --> 01:40:16,873
She will get completely cured isn't it

1018
01:40:17,142 --> 01:40:18,166
You don't worry

1019
01:40:18,411 --> 01:40:21,814
Once she comes out of the temple
Already she would be half cured

1020
01:40:22,086 --> 01:40:23,883
If nothing happens to her that's
enough for me

1021
01:40:24,222 --> 01:40:26,191
I will give five thousand to the temple

1022
01:40:27,129 --> 01:40:30,726
Because of me she is suffering

1023
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:58,485
Ganga I forgot to tell you one thing

1024
01:40:58,624 --> 01:41:01,561
You were telling that one anklet
was missing from Nagavalli's room

1025
01:41:01,998 --> 01:41:02,930
I got it

1026
01:41:03,033 --> 01:41:03,965
Where was it

1027
01:41:04,402 --> 01:41:05,198
It was in Soumya's room

1028
01:41:05,472 --> 01:41:06,268
I thought so

1029
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,267
See

1030
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,073
This only

1031
01:41:12,351 --> 01:41:13,477
Ya this is only the one which
she used to wear

1032
01:41:14,087 --> 01:41:17,922
One hundred and fifty years ago
Nagavalli used to wear this anklet only

1033
01:41:18,062 --> 01:41:21,795
Then this might not be that, leave it
This is just five years old

1034
01:41:22,003 --> 01:41:23,368
This is Nagavalli's only

1035
01:41:23,807 --> 01:41:25,274
I am telling you know that it's not that

1036
01:41:25,544 --> 01:41:29,141
Be quiet this is the one which I saw
when I first when to Nagavalli's room

1037
01:41:29,285 --> 01:41:31,777
Be quiet this is not the one which
you saw there

1038
01:41:32,091 --> 01:41:32,887
If its that one only
If its not that one only

1039
01:41:33,192 --> 01:41:34,284
Am telling you know that this is the one

1040
01:41:34,429 --> 01:41:35,155
Who told you

1041
01:41:35,329 --> 01:41:36,055
I am only telling you

1042
01:41:36,361 --> 01:41:37,121
I'm seeing this and telling you

1043
01:41:37,295 --> 01:41:38,782
I'm also telling you this because I about it

1044
01:41:39,062 --> 01:41:39,890
This not that

1045
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:42,092
Vijay don't boast as if you
know everything

1046
01:41:42,261 --> 01:41:43,055
Whose boasting

1047
01:41:43,227 --> 01:41:44,214
What are you telling

1048
01:41:44,493 --> 01:41:46,354
I can prove it to you anywhere
that this is not the one

1049
01:41:46,827 --> 01:41:48,519
You don't know anything about it

1050
01:41:49,026 --> 01:41:49,887
Me

1051
01:41:50,825 --> 01:41:53,550
Why are you getting angry

1052
01:41:57,092 --> 01:41:58,215
Why should we both fight for these anklet

1053
01:42:00,092 --> 01:42:01,147
Goddess will protect her

1054
01:42:01,626 --> 01:42:03,284
From today nothing will happen
to this lady

1055
01:42:03,525 --> 01:42:04,750
Be brave

1056
01:42:05,224 --> 01:42:07,279
As you told this is Nagavalli's only

1057
01:42:13,823 --> 01:42:14,753
What did you do

1058
01:42:14,957 --> 01:42:15,852
She is going in tension

1059
01:42:16,023 --> 01:42:17,350
Simply for fun

1060
01:42:19,223 --> 01:42:20,948
If you don't rag her you can't sleep

1061
01:43:42,145 --> 01:43:43,200
Come

1062
01:43:45,412 --> 01:43:48,070
Come!

1063
01:43:55,477 --> 01:44:00,839
Lets have passionate love, Come
on, Take me in your arms just once

1064
01:44:04,876 --> 01:44:09,329
Fulfill all my desires, Come soon and
bring passionate love Oh dear

1065
01:44:40,103 --> 01:44:41,192
Who is there

1066
01:44:41,604 --> 01:44:42,296
Who is that

1067
01:44:42,836 --> 01:44:46,164
Its me Vijay Rajendra Bahadur

1068
01:44:49,337 --> 01:44:51,233
Is it you, Open the door

1069
01:44:54,902 --> 01:44:56,560
Nagavalli tell me what you want

1070
01:44:56,769 --> 01:44:57,858
I want you, Why

1071
01:44:58,768 --> 01:45:01,528
I want to kill you, I won't
go until I kill you

1072
01:45:02,034 --> 01:45:02,794
That's not possible

1073
01:45:03,202 --> 01:45:04,632
That is possible

1074
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,189
Then kill me

1075
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:09,960
Not today the coming Durgashtmi day
I will kill you

1076
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:12,894
If I don't kill you my name
is not Nagavalli

1077
01:45:13,034 --> 01:45:15,692
If you are killing me on Durgashtmi day
Then why have you come today

1078
01:45:15,999 --> 01:45:18,054
Then go now, and come on that day only

1079
01:45:18,332 --> 01:45:20,921
I will go, Go, but again l
will come back

1080
01:45:24,598 --> 01:45:26,256
What happened sir

1081
01:45:30,963 --> 01:45:35,949
Nagavalli and would have come and sat

1082
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:38,549
Somebody has spoiled the penance

1083
01:45:39,196 --> 01:45:40,091
Who could it be

1084
01:45:56,894 --> 01:45:58,187
You did a mistake

1085
01:45:58,861 --> 01:46:02,189
You have made a mistake

1086
01:46:03,693 --> 01:46:04,521
No

1087
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:06,486
I've done the right thing

1088
01:46:10,825 --> 01:46:14,550
See please don't spoil our happiness

1089
01:46:14,691 --> 01:46:17,553
It can't be cured taking
pills or medicine

1090
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:20,584
It needs to destroy evil energy
with good energy

1091
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:30,577
What does this doctor
know about magic

1092
01:46:30,889 --> 01:46:32,444
This our Ramesh doesn't understand

1093
01:47:07,151 --> 01:47:07,945
Show me that

1094
01:47:08,517 --> 01:47:09,139
This one

1095
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:09,971
No

1096
01:47:19,216 --> 01:47:20,975
Ramesh he is the bridegroom for the Vani

1097
01:47:23,116 --> 01:47:25,841
Then please don't come with your
wife for the saree selection

1098
01:47:26,016 --> 01:47:27,708
Half of your life will be gone
in saree shop only

1099
01:47:31,748 --> 01:47:32,576
How is this saree

1100
01:47:35,647 --> 01:47:37,702
Ramesh I was searching for
this colour saree only

1101
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,967
You have understood my wife's
taste better than me

1102
01:47:51,977 --> 01:47:55,908
Swamji coming this fifteenth is my
daughters engagement

1103
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:58,143
Twenty sixth is the wedding

1104
01:47:58,744 --> 01:48:01,606
we have come to give you the
first card to you only

1105
01:48:01,809 --> 01:48:05,398
Before the wedding will our
bungalow problem be solved

1106
01:48:05,577 --> 01:48:10,598
Don't worry in two days
All your problems will be solved

1107
01:48:10,808 --> 01:48:11,863
Be brave

1108
01:48:28,073 --> 01:48:31,333
Coming Friday is very
auspicious it seems

1109
01:48:31,806 --> 01:48:34,395
I want to take Vani's presentation
jewellery on that day only

1110
01:48:34,572 --> 01:48:35,831
Will you come with me

1111
01:48:36,505 --> 01:48:37,366
Why

1112
01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:38,901
You could take Ramesh know

1113
01:48:39,006 --> 01:48:42,334
His contract work is going very
slowly so he is very much tensed

1114
01:48:42,805 --> 01:48:44,497
So he asked me take you only

1115
01:48:46,804 --> 01:48:47,598
Friday

1116
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:51,668
You want me to come with
you to take jewellery

1117
01:48:52,037 --> 01:48:56,024
Yes once the marriage work
starts we won't have time to go

1118
01:48:56,436 --> 01:48:57,366
You will come right

1119
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:58,465
Yes I will come

1120
01:48:59,969 --> 01:49:01,092
you should definitely come

1121
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:02,091
I will definitely come

1122
01:49:18,567 --> 01:49:20,360
To the honourable Mahadevan

1123
01:49:20,666 --> 01:49:22,960
And Srimati Vani,

1124
01:49:23,366 --> 01:49:27,693
On friday the twenty sixth of this month
The wedding has fixed by elders

1125
01:50:05,594 --> 01:50:07,490
Lets not use crooked roads

1126
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:10,318
Lets us not have any doubts in our minds

1127
01:50:10,692 --> 01:50:13,849
Let us not have such a life
Let us not think too much

1128
01:50:14,226 --> 01:50:16,246
Let us not create problems

1129
01:50:16,727 --> 01:50:21,487
In this life, Say goodbye to sorrow
And be happy everyday

1130
01:51:24,216 --> 01:51:25,543
They count you in the team but
don't make you play

1131
01:51:25,850 --> 01:51:26,872
That's not a good life

1132
01:51:27,216 --> 01:51:29,578
Please say sweet words

1133
01:51:29,848 --> 01:51:32,471
Let us not play wroth fire
Let us not fight in love

1134
01:51:32,749 --> 01:51:34,873
Please say sweet words

1135
01:51:35,448 --> 01:51:37,503
In the well that we saw in the night

1136
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:39,636
We should not fall in the morning

1137
01:52:29,574 --> 01:52:32,299
Wven after falling down,
his mustache is not dirty

1138
01:52:32,574 --> 01:52:35,037
That is nice

1139
01:52:35,141 --> 01:52:40,299
He came, ate and went away,
That's also nice

1140
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:45,796
Why does a cow need black eyeliner?.
Why does a nest have rent?.

1141
01:52:48,738 --> 01:52:51,532
Some proverbs are very true

1142
01:54:13,428 --> 01:54:14,585
Where is Ganga?.

1143
01:54:14,695 --> 01:54:16,283
Come we search for her

1144
01:54:34,991 --> 01:54:36,250
Please listen to me

1145
01:54:47,257 --> 01:54:49,186
The person who is going to be our
son in law is misbehaving with my wife

1146
01:54:49,367 --> 01:54:50,696
Ganga is lying there unconsciously

1147
01:55:13,394 --> 01:55:15,671
Sir, I have not done any
mistake in this thing sir

1148
01:55:15,787 --> 01:55:17,044
She only came and caught me

1149
01:55:18,989 --> 01:55:20,488
I know it

1150
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:21,436
You have not anything wrong

1151
01:55:23,865 --> 01:55:25,317
What are you doing here

1152
01:55:25,782 --> 01:55:27,820
You have misbehaved with my wife

1153
01:55:28,326 --> 01:55:29,473
And here you are acting here

1154
01:55:29,615 --> 01:55:30,864
Ramesh he hasn't done any mistake

1155
01:55:31,269 --> 01:55:32,123
You be quiet

1156
01:55:32,294 --> 01:55:33,475
I asked you that what you are doing here

1157
01:55:33,912 --> 01:55:36,818
You be quiet
Ramesh listen to me

1158
01:55:37,648 --> 01:55:39,258
He has done no mistake
What are you telling

1159
01:55:40,226 --> 01:55:43,098
That my Ganga misbehaved with him

1160
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:44,752
You are saying that my Ganga
went with him

1161
01:55:45,117 --> 01:55:47,155
Ramesh it s all Ganga s fault

1162
01:55:47,333 --> 01:55:48,548
Ganga only went in search of him

1163
01:55:49,052 --> 01:55:50,233
Ganga only misbehaved with him

1164
01:56:09,445 --> 01:56:14,459
That day my uncle was suspecting you
I told him that you were my Karna

1165
01:56:16,949 --> 01:56:19,449
today for some third person you are
complaining about your friend's wife

1166
01:56:25,709 --> 01:56:28,739
Don't tell my name from your mouth

1167
01:56:29,047 --> 01:56:32,178
Just because you selected this
fellow for our Vani

1168
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:35,878
You are talking so cheaply about Ganga

1169
01:56:36,219 --> 01:56:37,535
Tell

1170
01:56:37,772 --> 01:56:39,980
For a rascal like you there is no
place in this house

1171
01:56:40,251 --> 01:56:42,627
Get out from here

1172
01:56:49,805 --> 01:56:51,869
Ramesh listen to me patiently

1173
01:56:52,153 --> 01:56:53,614
You will only come to know
what is the truth

1174
01:56:53,992 --> 01:56:55,105
I said get out from here

1175
01:57:03,219 --> 01:57:04,505
Give me two days time

1176
01:57:04,887 --> 01:57:07,602
I will solve the problem then go

1177
01:57:07,951 --> 01:57:11,211
To solve the problem we
have the Swamiji

1178
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:12,236
We don't need you

1179
01:57:13,093 --> 01:57:14,994
Ramesh I will speak with
Ganga and go

1180
01:57:15,442 --> 01:57:16,658
You don't deserve even to say her name

1181
01:57:17,349 --> 01:57:20,679
He has asked you to go out
What are you seeing?. Get out

1182
01:57:21,774 --> 01:57:23,781
Listen to me
I will solve the problem and then go

1183
01:57:24,191 --> 01:57:26,673
You don't have to solve anything
I will look after everything

1184
01:57:26,916 --> 01:57:30,514
Sir spoiled my granddaughter's name
and had locked her in her room

1185
01:57:30,694 --> 01:57:31,772
He talk's only lies,Throw him out

1186
01:57:32,806 --> 01:57:33,652
Go out

1187
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,044
What is all this

1188
01:57:51,362 --> 01:57:54,077
Whom are you trying to
send out of the house

1189
01:57:54,324 --> 01:57:55,785
Him?.

1190
01:57:56,026 --> 01:57:58,542
If he leaves this house and goes

1191
01:57:58,955 --> 01:58:01,193
You will only face the problem

1192
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,901
He is telling about my Ganga

1193
01:58:03,142 --> 01:58:04,696
You don't have to tell me anything

1194
01:58:05,116 --> 01:58:06,635
I know everything

1195
01:58:07,567 --> 01:58:12,836
Its better he stays here than me

1196
01:58:13,799 --> 01:58:19,788
With my puja we need his psychiatrist
help to solve the problem here

1197
01:58:20,983 --> 01:58:24,998
That day while performing
puja my puja was disturbed

1198
01:58:25,785 --> 01:58:27,582
At that time he was coming down

1199
01:58:28,031 --> 01:58:30,676
I saw his glowing face

1200
01:58:31,129 --> 01:58:36,607
It showed that he had achieved
something in his face

1201
01:58:36,748 --> 01:58:38,849
I met him one day

1202
01:58:39,044 --> 01:58:41,050
And asked him what happened there

1203
01:58:41,692 --> 01:58:43,046
When I heard what had happened there

1204
01:58:43,529 --> 01:58:45,747
I was also frightened

1205
01:58:46,874 --> 01:58:49,260
When I asked that how he
achieved all this

1206
01:58:49,562 --> 01:58:51,186
He told me all about it

1207
01:58:51,656 --> 01:58:54,079
In Ramayana Ravana had ten heads

1208
01:58:54,482 --> 01:58:58,096
But this fellow has ten brains
in his head

1209
01:58:59,766 --> 01:59:01,951
He is not an ordinary psychiatrist

1210
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:04,955
He has studied in America and
won an gold medal

1211
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:08,398
Not only is he first student of the
world's famous psychiatrist

1212
01:59:08,705 --> 01:59:10,605
He is Bradley disciple

1213
01:59:11,646 --> 01:59:14,172
Once I met Bradley in America

1214
01:59:14,384 --> 01:59:17,218
I asked him about Para-psychology doubts

1215
01:59:17,558 --> 01:59:21,588
So he gave me one book which
was world famous

1216
01:59:22,035 --> 01:59:24,060
I read it and learnt lot of new things

1217
01:59:24,474 --> 01:59:28,641
I was happy when I came to know
that he had written that book

1218
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:34,088
You are trying to throw such a big
person out of your home

1219
01:59:36,030 --> 01:59:39,560
He is still here even when
you all are insulting him

1220
01:59:39,771 --> 01:59:41,261
Do you know why?.

1221
01:59:43,347 --> 01:59:44,371
Please don't tell

1222
01:59:44,749 --> 01:59:48,689
You are sending him out just because
he spoke a word about your wife

1223
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:55,497
But do you know that he given his
life only just to protect your wife

1224
02:00:00,247 --> 02:00:01,144
Ya its true

1225
02:00:01,316 --> 02:00:06,087
If Ganga needs to be alive
then Vijay must die

1226
02:00:07,597 --> 02:00:09,258
That's only the fate

1227
02:00:10,235 --> 02:00:12,568
I believe you must be surprised
after listening to me

1228
02:00:14,144 --> 02:00:17,308
Vijay please tell your friend
also what you told me

1229
02:00:29,443 --> 02:00:34,077
As you all know the problem of Nagavalli

1230
02:00:34,286 --> 02:00:36,551
It's not Soumya

1231
02:00:37,225 --> 02:00:38,521
It's your wife Ganga

1232
02:00:40,599 --> 02:00:45,769
I realized it on first day itself when
I met Soumya I knew

1233
02:00:48,884 --> 02:00:52,151
But that day I didn't know who is
affected by Nagavalli on that day

1234
02:00:53,861 --> 02:00:57,823
One day I took Ganga to
Nagavalli room

1235
02:00:58,738 --> 02:01:02,335
In that room I noticed the changes
happening in Ganga's face

1236
02:01:02,613 --> 02:01:05,607
See here the jewellery

1237
02:01:06,254 --> 02:01:08,587
Before that I had never seen
Ganga in that state

1238
02:01:16,542 --> 02:01:19,809
Soumya who had brought the
key had no problem

1239
02:01:20,349 --> 02:01:24,516
But Ganga who had entered the room
was being troubled by Nagavalli

1240
02:01:26,864 --> 02:01:32,306
To confirm this I argued with Ganga,
that the anklet was not Nagavalli's

1241
02:01:34,213 --> 02:01:36,342
Vijay don't boast as if you
know everything

1242
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:37,482
What are you telling

1243
02:01:38,789 --> 02:01:42,125
I can prove it to you anywhere
that this is not the one

1244
02:01:42,296 --> 02:01:42,852
Me

1245
02:01:43,232 --> 02:01:44,289
Me!

1246
02:01:46,472 --> 02:01:48,201
Ganga sometimes gets
transformed into Nagavalli

1247
02:01:52,217 --> 02:01:53,617
This is the problem Ganga is facing

1248
02:01:56,627 --> 02:02:01,567
We have read that seventy five years
old lady acts as sixteen years old girl

1249
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:06,541
Or twenty five year old boy acts
as seventy year old man

1250
02:02:06,781 --> 02:02:07,770
We have read all that

1251
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:09,246
This is also like that only

1252
02:02:10,622 --> 02:02:15,119
As per medical terms we call this
as dual personality or spilt personality

1253
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:18,801
That means two persons becoming
one person

1254
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:20,232
Possession state

1255
02:02:20,643 --> 02:02:22,772
Wven our Ganga is also
facing same problem

1256
02:02:23,282 --> 02:02:28,656
To know how did Ganga get this, I had
been to Ganga's village with your uncle

1257
02:02:28,894 --> 02:02:33,391
Ganga's father who was
frequently transferred

1258
02:02:33,638 --> 02:02:35,834
used to leave her with
her granny's place

1259
02:02:36,778 --> 02:02:39,748
Ganga without the parents love
grew with her granny

1260
02:02:40,253 --> 02:02:42,153
She grew up listening to her
granny's story

1261
02:02:42,257 --> 02:02:46,458
What ever story she used to here
She used to imagine that it was herself

1262
02:02:46,732 --> 02:02:48,393
When ganga came to high school

1263
02:02:48,603 --> 02:02:51,665
her parents decided to take her

1264
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:58,653
Ganga who didn't want to leave her
granny started walking in night

1265
02:03:02,499 --> 02:03:05,561
One day she threw her answer paper

1266
02:03:06,808 --> 02:03:10,576
and went out madly her class teacher
still hasn't forgotton it

1267
02:03:10,984 --> 02:03:13,419
This was the first time Ganga
faced psychic disorder

1268
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:19,891
With out knowing this ganga's parents
took her without giving her treatment

1269
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:25,233
After that she married you, this house,
And after hearing Nagavalli's story

1270
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:30,646
She was in pshyic disorder she couldn't
control herself and went to her room

1271
02:03:31,393 --> 02:03:32,918
Ganga went to Nagavalli's room

1272
02:03:33,297 --> 02:03:36,325
She stood as Nagavalli only

1273
02:03:38,273 --> 02:03:40,332
Ganga started thinking that she
only was Nagavalli

1274
02:03:42,450 --> 02:03:43,975
Ganga started slowly transforming
to Nagavalli

1275
02:03:45,957 --> 02:03:50,557
In one way Nagavalli started
possessing on Ganga

1276
02:03:52,605 --> 02:03:54,904
But I couldn't see any change in Ganga

1277
02:03:55,309 --> 02:03:59,305
Ganga who was becoming Nagavalli
knew all your habits

1278
02:03:59,552 --> 02:04:04,049
What time you sleep and wake up
she knew what all you do

1279
02:04:04,663 --> 02:04:10,265
Being with you only she could do things
without unknowingly to you

1280
02:04:10,609 --> 02:04:14,845
That day she put fire on her saree and
made all of you to think it was Soumya

1281
02:04:16,688 --> 02:04:20,251
That day when she went to kill Vani

1282
02:04:20,563 --> 02:04:22,326
Nagavalli who was transformed as Ganga

1283
02:04:24,939 --> 02:04:29,276
That Nagavalli what revenge she
had on our Vani

1284
02:04:29,749 --> 02:04:33,517
Nagavalli thinks that her lover
Ramnath is prof Mahadev

1285
02:04:35,796 --> 02:04:38,699
She didn't want her lover to marry Vani

1286
02:04:38,935 --> 02:04:41,872
So she tried killing Vani

1287
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:44,440
When that didn't work

1288
02:04:44,748 --> 02:04:48,949
She planned to spoil Mahadev's
image in front of you

1289
02:04:51,862 --> 02:04:54,662
That means

1290
02:04:54,801 --> 02:04:56,063
So who tried to kill me

1291
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:57,553
It was her only

1292
02:05:02,919 --> 02:05:06,023
You were the only one who was
obstructing Nagavalli

1293
02:05:06,201 --> 02:05:09,077
So she tried to kill you twice

1294
02:05:09,215 --> 02:05:11,085
Once she tried to kill you in fire in
your godown

1295
02:05:11,258 --> 02:05:12,890
She tried to burn you

1296
02:05:13,872 --> 02:05:16,280
When I came to know that Ganga
has brought food for you

1297
02:05:16,651 --> 02:05:17,882
I had a doubt

1298
02:05:18,023 --> 02:05:18,957
I came there

1299
02:05:19,096 --> 02:05:20,590
And saved you

1300
02:05:25,393 --> 02:05:27,801
Second time she tried killing you
by pushing the fish tank

1301
02:05:28,005 --> 02:05:31,955
When everybody were shocked to
see what had happened to you

1302
02:05:32,392 --> 02:05:36,068
Ganga acted as if it didn't
matter to her, I observed

1303
02:05:36,244 --> 02:05:37,144
Not only that,

1304
02:05:37,283 --> 02:05:40,456
I observed Ganga transforming
into Nagavali

1305
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:45,717
To change all your mood only I dragged
Soumya from there

1306
02:05:49,507 --> 02:05:52,280
To know what is Nagavalli's
real intention

1307
02:05:52,858 --> 02:05:54,387
I locked Soumya

1308
02:05:54,564 --> 02:05:57,132
And followed Ganga

1309
02:05:57,311 --> 02:06:02,197
That Nagavalli still thinks that
king is still alive

1310
02:06:02,335 --> 02:06:06,446
That day though he was performing
puja still I went to Nagavalli's room

1311
02:06:06,621 --> 02:06:09,794
I only spoke to Nagavalli
as if I was the king

1312
02:06:09,971 --> 02:06:15,016
That day I learnt that Nagavalli would kill
the king on next Durga-ashtmi

1313
02:06:16,704 --> 02:06:20,380
The moment I spoke to her as king

1314
02:06:20,523 --> 02:06:24,336
She thought that I was only
Vijay Rao Bahadur

1315
02:06:24,574 --> 02:06:30,363
That means on that day she will
take revenge on you

1316
02:06:38,541 --> 02:06:43,622
If that doesn't happen Nagavalli
will destroy herself

1317
02:06:45,172 --> 02:06:49,053
which will kill our Ganga and
not Nagavalli

1318
02:06:52,340 --> 02:06:55,993
If Ganga needs to live
I have to be sacrificed

1319
02:07:00,131 --> 02:07:05,487
Ganga doesn't know that Nagavalli
comes into her and goes

1320
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:15,239
I'm coming

1321
02:07:20,604 --> 02:07:21,999
Somebody had locked me inside

1322
02:07:22,402 --> 02:07:24,296
Soumiya, Yes it might be her

1323
02:07:24,633 --> 02:07:28,082
See here somebody has
torn my saree

1324
02:07:28,362 --> 02:07:29,326
This also soumya only must have done

1325
02:07:29,494 --> 02:07:32,080
Yesterday how was the song and the dance

1326
02:07:33,089 --> 02:07:34,574
I am not able to remember anything

1327
02:07:35,187 --> 02:07:36,877
I slept of in that party

1328
02:07:37,051 --> 02:07:38,343
I don't know what happened later

1329
02:07:38,483 --> 02:07:40,570
When did I come and sleep here

1330
02:07:46,206 --> 02:07:48,065
Mahadev, When did you come

1331
02:07:48,503 --> 02:07:49,467
How are you?.

1332
02:07:49,603 --> 02:07:51,293
Did anybody give you coffee

1333
02:07:51,434 --> 02:07:53,658
There is nobody to give coffee
to our son in law

1334
02:07:53,964 --> 02:07:54,858
Wait I will only get it

1335
02:07:58,291 --> 02:07:59,379
What is this all

1336
02:08:02,285 --> 02:08:06,041
I had never experienced like this
situation in my life ever

1337
02:08:06,181 --> 02:08:10,073
Today Nagavalli is going to kill you

1338
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:12,535
If I think about it my body shivers

1339
02:08:12,873 --> 02:08:13,894
Now what will you do

1340
02:08:14,071 --> 02:08:18,962
Now to separate Ganaga
from Nagavalli with a new method

1341
02:08:19,264 --> 02:08:20,352
Now what should I do you tell me

1342
02:08:20,529 --> 02:08:23,921
You should perform puja to
destroy Nagavalli

1343
02:08:26,423 --> 02:08:28,225
Please for Ganga perform the puja

1344
02:08:28,398 --> 02:08:29,492
I will definitely do it

1345
02:08:34,861 --> 02:08:38,101
To take jewelery for Vani

1346
02:08:38,275 --> 02:08:40,111
Ganga has called me to go with her

1347
02:08:40,284 --> 02:08:41,514
You will come know Vijay

1348
02:08:41,657 --> 02:08:42,853
I will definitely come

1349
02:08:43,163 --> 02:08:49,018
While going on the way Nagavalli
would take revenge on me

1350
02:08:49,424 --> 02:08:50,518
This is her plan

1351
02:08:53,610 --> 02:08:55,275
That means the day which you said

1352
02:08:55,954 --> 02:08:57,116
Ya its today only

1353
02:08:58,297 --> 02:08:59,129
Now what to do

1354
02:09:00,506 --> 02:09:01,977
Now you have to do what I say

1355
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,960
Ganga who is ready to get jewellery

1356
02:09:06,199 --> 02:09:08,400
You should stop her somehow
saying you shouldn't go with vijay

1357
02:09:09,748 --> 02:09:12,885
What if I stop her
Stop her then see

1358
02:09:32,347 --> 02:09:33,441
Where are you going

1359
02:09:34,087 --> 02:09:37,259
Did you forget that I've to go with
Vijay to buy jewellery for Vani

1360
02:09:37,437 --> 02:09:42,321
What is the necessity to go now only

1361
02:09:42,458 --> 02:09:44,020
Today is Friday and auspicious day

1362
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:46,196
There is no other auspicious day
for next two weeks it seems

1363
02:09:46,343 --> 02:09:47,779
That's why we will go and come

1364
02:09:49,690 --> 02:09:52,291
I don't like you going out with Vijay

1365
02:09:52,537 --> 02:09:53,300
Why

1366
02:09:56,487 --> 02:09:58,187
You shouldn't go with him

1367
02:10:00,873 --> 02:10:01,636
Why

1368
02:10:02,849 --> 02:10:04,616
I won't let you to go with him

1369
02:10:07,268 --> 02:10:09,572
For Vani I will go and get the
jewellery if you want

1370
02:10:16,173 --> 02:10:19,150
You won't let me to go near him

1371
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:28,859
How dare you that you tell me
not to go with him

1372
02:10:29,668 --> 02:10:35,523
Coming durgashamti if I don't burn you
then my name is not Nagavalli

1373
02:10:50,526 --> 02:10:51,657
I did something know?.

1374
02:10:53,793 --> 02:10:55,251
No why

1375
02:10:55,733 --> 02:10:57,093
I just now did something Ramesh

1376
02:10:58,557 --> 02:10:59,097
No Ganga

1377
02:11:00,362 --> 02:11:00,556
No I did something

1378
02:11:02,152 --> 02:11:02,388
No you did not do anything

1379
02:11:03,134 --> 02:11:04,595
If I have done anything
wrong please forgive me

1380
02:11:05,764 --> 02:11:08,366
You wont hate me right
Please forgive me

1381
02:11:11,389 --> 02:11:14,757
Why are you talking like this

1382
02:11:15,878 --> 02:11:16,620
How can I hate you

1383
02:11:17,463 --> 02:11:17,727
You are my life

1384
02:11:22,690 --> 02:11:29,396
You are not angry on me right

1385
02:11:36,766 --> 02:11:44,480
Please forgive me

1386
02:11:56,444 --> 02:12:01,828
Please forgive me

1387
02:12:37,342 --> 02:12:38,686
Wnough

1388
02:12:38,841 --> 02:12:40,110
Wnough!

1389
02:12:42,244 --> 02:12:44,340
I am not able to see my wife's position

1390
02:12:44,442 --> 02:12:47,600
And she wants to take revenge on you

1391
02:12:47,779 --> 02:12:49,482
No this is enough
You please go away from here

1392
02:12:50,104 --> 02:12:51,582
I will take care of ganga

1393
02:12:51,721 --> 02:12:57,147
I will take her to London, America,
Japan for her treatment

1394
02:12:57,585 --> 02:13:02,159
But it's not proper for you to
give your life for my wife

1395
02:13:02,736 --> 02:13:05,451
Please go away from here

1396
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:07,651
I'm a doctor

1397
02:13:08,145 --> 02:13:12,876
If I run for my life leaving my patient
Then it's no use me being a doctor

1398
02:13:13,062 --> 02:13:15,319
Then who will help our Ganga

1399
02:13:15,503 --> 02:13:19,675
If you support me I will
certainly save Ganga

1400
02:13:22,234 --> 02:13:24,174
You will protect Ganga

1401
02:13:24,392 --> 02:13:26,491
But who will protect you

1402
02:13:28,244 --> 02:13:30,393
But you have to be brave
and listen to me

1403
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,114
Sir why did you ask me to come

1404
02:13:35,681 --> 02:13:36,544
Come with me

1405
02:14:14,326 --> 02:14:18,313
In that circle Nagavalli has
to come and sit there

1406
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:24,217

1450
02:24:02,481 --> 02:24:03,103
Ganga Ramesh

1451
02:24:03,713 --> 02:24:04,540

1452
02:24:06,378 --> 02:24:06,898
Vijay

Now take your wife she is
perfectly alright

1455
02:24:19,864 --> 02:24:22,724
Take her where you America
Japan anywhere

1456
02:24:22,994 --> 02:24:26,978
But not for treatment

1457
02:24:29,788 --> 02:24:32,613
If you want shift your room to
Nagavalli's room

1458
02:24:37,514 --> 02:24:39,941
I don't know how to thank you

1459
02:24:41,342 --> 02:24:43,305
There is one person waiting
to be thanked

1460
02:24:43,541 --> 02:24:44,765
I need to tell her thanks

1461
02:24:45,704 --> 02:24:51,391
Soumya had agreed to act a hundred
times if Ganga could be cured

1462
02:24:53,665 --> 02:24:55,389
First we must thank her

1463
02:25:09,382 --> 02:25:13,604
No amount of thanking is enough
for amount of help you've given

1464
02:25:13,844 --> 02:25:16,772
Because you help was
above everyone else

1465
02:25:18,806 --> 02:25:22,630
Soumya I wanted to say you
something from so many days

1466
02:25:22,869 --> 02:25:24,866
Shall I say

1467
02:25:26,161 --> 02:25:29,213
Till now my mother was forcing
me to get married

1468
02:25:29,382 --> 02:25:30,832
But I didn't get married

1469
02:25:31,135 --> 02:25:32,097
Do you know why?.

1470
02:25:32,696 --> 02:25:33,890
Because I'm a psychiatrist doctor

1471
02:25:34,224 --> 02:25:37,879
My work shouldn't become a
problem for my wife

1472
02:25:38,187 --> 02:25:40,046
That's why I didn't get
married till now

1473
02:25:40,552 --> 02:25:41,981
But after seeing you

1474
02:25:42,250 --> 02:25:46,178
I felt that you are the only one who
has completely understood me

1475
02:25:46,613 --> 02:25:49,132
If I am ok to you

1476
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:52,504
Shall I send my mother to see
you as my bride?.

1477
02:25:59,201 --> 02:26:02,061
Who will marry my grand daughter,

1478
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:04,754
If you don't mind am I ok to you?.
