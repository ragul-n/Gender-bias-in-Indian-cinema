2
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,035
Hey, Tanya.

3
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:08,036
Come have some breakfast.

4
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:10,211
Should I prepare it?
- I will eat it later.

5
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,045
"Tanya, the basin is not working."

6
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:20,146
And uncle is coming today too.
- Uncle!

7
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:23,312
Deepak sir has given us this house
because he knew that two girls...

8
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,079
...would take good
care of this house.

9
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,180
Deepak sir is abroad.

10
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:29,846
What should we do of
that scheming uncle?

11
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:42,947
Uncle...

12
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:49,648
"Uncle, please use words
more than your hands."

13
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,248
Your rent is ready.

14
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,448
Ten thousand rent for
such a huge place.

15
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:55,615
Call it maintenance.

16
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:57,582
"Whatever it is, it
has been decided..."

17
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:58,715
...between Tanya and Deepak sir.

18
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:02,749
If I would get some tea and snacks.
Should I have a seat?

19
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:04,682
"Hey, uncle!"

20
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:08,283
Are you here too?

21
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,083
Here are your ten thousand rupees.

22
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,650
Will you have tea or something?

23
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,850
"No, I was just leaving."

24
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,417
Please go then.
- Yes.

25
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:22,517
He has started to touch me again.
- The old hag!

26
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:25,251
I have repaired the basin.

27
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,551
Your plumber's fees are saved.

28
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:31,385
"Why do you worry about money?
I am there, isn't it?"

29
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:35,118
Do you know? An ad agency
called me up today.

30
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:36,185
For a video test.

31
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:43,019
I will have a bath and get ready.

32
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,619
I am late for the office.

33
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:53,420
I will send this consignment
to London by tomorrow.

34
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:15,721
I know that you go to Scorpion's...

35
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:18,388
...you play pool and dance there too.

36
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:19,755
"Yes, but all alone."

37
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:21,922
Why?

38
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,522
Do you have some special
hatred towards men?

39
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:26,689
"Why, Sameer?"

40
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:29,156
Have I ever shown any
hatred towards you?

41
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:32,423
"No, but you never
come on a date too."

42
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:34,923
"Maybe, something such
has happened with me..."

43
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,023
...because of which I don't
go on dates with men.

44
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,190
It seems that...

45
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,857
...your boy friend has
broken your heart.

46
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,191
Did I say so?

47
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:49,291
"Maybe, in the childhood."

48
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:52,992
That's none of your business.

49
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:39,162
"Hey, we were just romancing a bit!"

50
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:49,796
"'What is love, what is romance..."'

51
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:51,197
' It has to be shown to you today.'

52
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:48,215
You are going tomorrow.

53
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:52,048
That uncle will come again
to ask for the rent.

54
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,749
From where will you bring the money?

55
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:04,149
Go to sleep.

56
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:24,484
Has the taxi come?

57
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,151
"Madam, the taxi is
just about to come."

58
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:31,552
These ten thousand. Throw
them on that uncle's face.

59
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:32,818
Where did these come from?

60
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:35,652
They fell from the sky.

61
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:39,385
"Tanya, are you really
going for fifteen days?"

62
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,586
Yes.

63
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:08,138
I don't feel like going out at all.

64
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:11,795
"C'mon, otherwise that
Tanya will scold me."

65
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,688
Why will Tanya scold you?

66
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:17,978
"Before leaving, she had called
me from the airport and..."

67
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:22,162
...told me that you'd be feeling
very lonely and depressed.

68
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:26,822
"I am already feeling that,
without Tanya."

69
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:30,226
"Therefore, I will take
you out every evening."

70
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,417
At the Singhania's...

71
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:38,487
But I don't feel like going
to any party at all.

72
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:42,687
"C'mon, wear some nice
dress and let's go."

73
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,091
"Okay. Go out, I will change."

74
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,725
"Sapna, are you shying from me?"

75
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,291
I am your girlfriend too.

76
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,239
But you are a man.

77
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:03,905
"Don't say that I am a man
and insult me, okay?"

78
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,523
We have to go to the party, isn't it?
- Yes.

79
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:12,113
Will you chuck me out?

80
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:15,943
"Don't insult me, I am going.
Don't chuck me out like this."

81
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:33,441
I am very scared. C'mon
let's go home.

82
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:36,571
"We will have fun, c'mon."

83
00:13:56,963 --> 00:13:59,553
"Bharadwaj, why do you keep
on going to the bar?"

84
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,363
This is your fifth drink.

85
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:04,664
You know it. I come to
parties only to drink.

86
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:06,764
You won't mend your ways.

87
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:11,868
I have started this
drink right away.

88
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:16,598
Wow! Rahul. What goods!

89
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:18,165
But she is crazy.

90
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:22,232
She doesn't know that neither
will your peg be over...

91
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:24,435
...and nor will you
dance with anyone.

92
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,856
"Isn't it Rahul? Hey, listen
to me. At least listen to me."

93
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:33,173
Do you think that I am drunk?
Am I just babbling something?

94
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,935
"The... girl... who is with you,
Jojo, who is she?"

95
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:09,136
She isn't your type at all.

96
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:11,703
I can see that.

97
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:17,870
She... feels safe with me.

98
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:22,073
"So, go and tell her,
that I am safe too."

99
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,320
Are you introducing me to her?

100
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:32,611
Meet him. This is Rahul.

101
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:35,578
My boyfriend.

102
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,830
What happened?

103
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,174
Nothing.

104
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:11,524
"Nothing, you will kill me.
- No, please tell me."

105
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:13,541
I was just thinking...

106
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:19,741
Isn't it?

107
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,479
I think that Jojo
is feeling jealous.

108
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,809
Isn't it?

109
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,776
C'mon. C'mon.

110
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:50,984
"You must have missed
me so much, isn't it?"

111
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,177
"No, I didn't miss you at all."

112
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:56,678
Listen...

113
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,001
"I will just go to the washroom.
- Yes, go."

114
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:01,091
"Go. He is there, isn't it?"

115
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:03,418
Get lost.
- What? - Get lost.

116
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:06,545
Oh no. I have to drop her home.

117
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,145
"Yes, I will drop her, darling."

118
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:11,345
You can't drop her. She
has to go with me.

119
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:14,779
"Why not? She's safe with
me now, isn't it?"

120
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,379
Hey no. This isn't done.
I will go to drop her.

121
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:18,579
How can you go? This isn't done.

122
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:19,946
How much will you take
to go away from here?

123
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:23,580
No... no. This isn't done.
Can anyone go to drop her?

124
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:24,680
How much will you take?

125
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:25,747
What is this?

126
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,280
Keep all of this. And don't be
seen near her for some days.

127
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,647
No.

128
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:34,497
"I am in a hurry, can I go home?"

129
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:37,707
"Hey, don't worry. He
is there, isn't it?"

130
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:40,114
He'll drop you. He's a good boy.

131
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:46,415
C'mon. Let's dance. C'mon.

132
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:56,266
What do you mean?

133
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:05,483
This is a very strange
to express your love.

134
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:07,916
"But, to whom are you saying it?"

135
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,584
Can I take your phone number?

136
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,351
Take it.

137
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:37,219
Right here.
- Here? - Enough.

138
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,350
"Hey, what happened?"

139
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,503
Jojo. He has disappeared somewhere.

140
00:18:55,854 --> 00:19:00,400
And I think that he has
some new boyfriend.

141
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,421
"Yes, he is cheating on me."

142
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:08,055
I am all alone.

143
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:11,155
"Like that, what are you doing
in the evening today?"

144
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:14,055
"Actually...
- That means you aren't doing anything, right?"

145
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,555
I will come there.

146
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:17,900
"And after that, we will
go to the disco."

147
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:18,822
No... But...

148
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,522
I know that you won't ditch me.

149
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:22,923
You are not like Jojo.

150
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:24,523
But... please listen...

151
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:27,956
Are you crying?

152
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:31,623
"See, please don't cry. Okay... okay.
Please ditch me."

153
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:02,000
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

154
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:03,993
Do you miss Jojo?

155
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:14,027
Everything will be all right.

156
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:24,761
What has happened to you?
Aren't you ashamed?

157
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,700
"Sapna, please listen to me."

158
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:31,620
"Boys love girls, and
girls love boys."

159
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,000
And... since I have seen you...

160
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,000
...I have fallen in love with you.

161
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:39,395
"That means, you were fooling
me all the time?"

162
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,500
There was no other way
to come close to you.

163
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:48,500
You fooled me?
- No. - But I don't love you.

164
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,130
"But, at least listen to me."

165
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:57,463
"Sapna, listen to me.
Where are you going?"

166
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:03,164
"Sapna, listen to me."

167
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:04,697
Please take me away quickly.

168
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:27,833
"Hey. How will I take the taxi out?
- Hey, wait a minute."

169
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:31,500
"Sapna, please wait. Sapna,
listen to me."

170
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,034
She has closed the door.
I will take my car out...

171
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:47,500
...you take your taxi out.
- Why are you getting angry on me?

172
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,301
Shut up!
- The fool!

173
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,201
Keep the milk outside.

174
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:05,802
I will show him.

175
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:11,169
I have told you so many times
to keep the milk outside.

176
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,000
What? What is the matter?

177
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,503
Why are you showing me this
hundred rupee note?

178
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:21,000
What has happened?
What are you showing me?

179
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,500
You have brought me to
your house all alone.

180
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,900
Till the time that I didn't meet you,
I never liked boys at all.

181
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:25,500
So what? Did you like girls?
- Shut up.

182
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:26,423
Do you know?

183
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:30,557
I and Tanya used to go out and
beat these ruffian boys.

184
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:33,000
Your wrists must really
be paining. Poor wrists!

185
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:57,226
How are you?

186
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,093
"I am happy, I mean I am very happy."

187
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:03,959
Yes?
- Yes.

188
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:08,193
I was very worried about you.
You were all alone.

189
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,400
Didn't you miss me?
- I missed you a lot.

190
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,727
But something has happened
due to which...

191
00:27:15,794 --> 00:27:17,500
...I didn't even understand
how the days passed.

192
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:18,927
What happened?

193
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:37,595
With whom? Who is he?

194
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:40,800
You will like him a lot too.

195
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,363
"He is not like other boys, okay?"

196
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,029
He has his own shipping company.

197
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,730
He has shifted from London
since two years.

198
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:50,800
His whole family is in London still.

199
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,163
He is from some good family.

200
00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:58,800
"Therefore, he is good too, isn't it?
- Yes?"

201
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,000
"Tanya, I want you to meet today
in the evening itself."

202
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:04,897
I have told so much
about you to him.

203
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,600
"Because I am happy to meet Rahul,
all these chips..."

204
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:03,800
It seems that my birthday
wasn't lucky for you.

205
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,069
I feel something like that too.

206
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:10,169
"Anyway, winning and losing
is a way of life."

207
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,303
I don't have a habit of losing.

208
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:14,803
"Like that, even I have
a habit of winning."

209
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:17,303
So let's see who wins and who loses.

210
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,470
What is the game?
- Life is a game too.

211
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:23,671
It seems that we will enjoy
each other's company.

212
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:26,071
"Because, even I think
life to be a game."

213
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:28,071
"That means, that you think
love to be a game too!?"

214
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:30,604
Sapna is my love.

215
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:37,138
Shall we move?

216
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,700
Did you see that?
Didn't I tell you...

217
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:47,639
...that you would like Rahul too?

218
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:50,673
I did see. I haven't
come to know him yet.

219
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:54,673
As it is... one meeting isn't
enough to know a person.

220
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,940
"Like that, even fifteen to
twenty meetings..."

221
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:58,457
...are not enough to know a person.

222
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:02,907
This means that Sapna doesn't know you yet.
- Why?

223
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:05,907
"You must've met only fifteen
to twenty times, isn't it?"

224
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:11,008
"Knowing isn't necessary,
recognizing is."

225
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:13,575
I think Sapna and I have recognized
each other's love.

226
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:15,208
Love.

227
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,208
Boys do so many things
in the name of love!

228
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:21,709
I am not one of those boys.

229
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,109
I feel all the boys to
be one and the same.

230
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:27,076
It's good that I don't feel all
the girls to be one and the same.

231
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:31,676
"I can differentiate. I
love Sapna, not Tanya."

232
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:55,245
Only nice?

233
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:59,000
"What do you want to hear, Sapna?
- Whatever you want to say."

234
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:05,478
"Sapna, I can't see you in tears."

235
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:07,445
In tears?

236
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,612
Why will Rahul make me cry?

237
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:18,646
"Will Rahul make you cry? Yes.
Sapna, all boys do this."

238
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:22,500
First they show love and
then they sweet talk.

239
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,800
"After that, they behave as if you
are their father's property."

240
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:33,600
"As soon as they see
a beauty, they slip."

241
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:37,800
Rahul isn't like this.

242
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:39,481
Bet?

243
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:45,400
Do you have so much faith in Rahul?

244
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:47,100
Are you afraid to place a bet?

245
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:50,949
Bet.

246
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,850
You?
- You?

247
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,850
It doesn't seem that you wish to commit suicide.
- Yes?

248
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:14,500
"I mean, how did you come
in front of my car?"

249
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:17,500
I was a bit desperate. I
wasn't getting any taxi.

250
00:32:18,218 --> 00:32:19,185
Where are you going?

251
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:22,518
No taxi is ready to drop me there.

252
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,385
Who will go so far?

253
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:26,185
You will.

254
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,186
"Tanya, I have to go to
an important meeting."

255
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,500
I have an important meeting
with a big client.

256
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:38,000
I have to reach his
bungalow at seven.

257
00:32:38,186 --> 00:32:39,153
But so far...

258
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:41,253
I am your girlfriend's best friend.

259
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:43,353
Can't you do this much for her?

260
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:53,854
What do you work as?

261
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:57,200
My boss imports diamonds
from South Africa.

262
00:32:57,454 --> 00:32:58,954
I look after the sales.

263
00:32:58,954 --> 00:33:01,454
And the client whom you
are going to meet?

264
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:04,171
He is a big client for us.
He buys diamonds from us.

265
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,155
Yes?

266
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,289
I just said it.

267
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:14,689
You are flirting with your
best friend's boyfriend.

268
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:17,023
"See, please don't misunderstand me."

269
00:33:17,323 --> 00:33:20,200
You are so handsome that
any girl will praise you.

270
00:33:37,591 --> 00:33:39,800
"Is Mr. Mittal there?
- Are you Miss, Tanya? - Yes."

271
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:42,200
He is expected. Please sit.
I have to go too.

272
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:45,025
You have to go? Where?

273
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,025
It's my wife's delivery. A child.

274
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,792
That's all right but... What
will we do alone here?

275
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:52,600
Everything has been arranged
inside. To eat and to drink.

276
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,259
"Please, madam, you
people sit inside."

277
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:03,959
It seems that your client wants
to meet you all alone.

278
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:07,326
Therefore... his servant...
instructions...

279
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:10,594
How can I wait for that
client alone here?

280
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:14,800
I am very scared. Please wait.
- No.

281
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:18,661
"But...
- After all, I am..."

282
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:21,900
My girlfriend's best friend.

283
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:34,929
I like hammocks.

284
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:45,500
I remember my mother's lap.
- Where are your parents?

285
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,363
"Mummy died, when I was very young."

286
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,800
Papa used to beat her up. She went...

287
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,530
...and he started beating me up.

288
00:34:55,297 --> 00:34:56,897
"What are you talking about?
- Yes, really!"

289
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:05,500
When I was eighteen years of age
...I ran away from home.

290
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,900
I worked and I studied.

291
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:10,709
"Now, I don't have anyone
in this world."

292
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,732
Only one friend.

293
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:22,200
You need a life partner now.

294
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:26,200
What... is this?

295
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,100
Mischief.

296
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,801
Your client seems to
be very colorful.

297
00:35:45,168 --> 00:35:46,135
And too chilled.

298
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,300
I don't think that he
has good intentions.

299
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:50,200
"Therefore, I told you to stay."

300
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:02,469
We are having bottles
and bottles over here.

301
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:05,800
Where is that client of your's?

302
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,370
It seems that he forgot
his residence address.

303
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:14,837
It seems...

304
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,500
...that your client got
some new friend.

305
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:19,637
He forgot you.

306
00:36:25,604 --> 00:36:27,138
Will we leave this
bungalow unlocked?

307
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:31,238
What if someone loots it?
- So?

308
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:32,805
What do you mean?

309
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:37,505
We will have champagne and spend
the night here itself.

310
00:36:41,906 --> 00:36:46,039
I have an idea. You guard
this bungalow. I will move.

311
00:41:04,593 --> 00:41:06,393
"After all, what has happened to you?"

312
00:41:07,494 --> 00:41:10,361
"This means that this Mr. Mittal,
client, champagne..."

313
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:13,800
"...all this was staged,
just to seduce me."

314
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:15,661
You are drunk. You
are so much drunk...

315
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:17,500
...that you have lost yourself
in your dreams.

316
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:20,200
What were you thinking?
That you'd be in my arms?

317
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:22,962
"I am watching you since
so long, standing here."

318
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:26,728
You should be ashamed. After
all your friend is...

319
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:35,000
"Is your girlfriend. Therefore,
I did all this."

320
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:36,696
What do you mean?

321
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:44,096
Why?

322
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:48,730
"Because, I didn't want Sapna to
have relations with such a..."

323
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:53,297
...boy who'd be seduced
by a beautiful body.

324
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:04,698
"You were strengthening our
relation, mine and Sapna's?"

325
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:09,065
And I felt that you
were breaking it.

326
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:13,099
The two of us had bet.

327
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:15,999
That you were like
the other boys too.

328
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:19,899
I lost.

329
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:26,200
"Please, don't tell this to Sapna.
She will tease me, please."

330
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:33,267
Don't worry. I won't tell anything.

331
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:34,767
This secret will remain a secret.

332
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:41,868
"But, it is too late now."

333
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:26,143
I don't need these
ten thousand today.

334
00:44:35,944 --> 00:44:37,777
"So what, will you just keep working?"

335
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:41,077
"I run a whole shipping company.
- So go, look after it."

336
00:44:48,945 --> 00:44:50,945
You know that you are my life now.

337
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:52,845
"When I get up in the morning,
I think about you."

338
00:44:52,945 --> 00:44:56,812
"When I work, I think about you.
- Really?"

339
00:44:58,712 --> 00:45:03,346
"Hey, yes.
- What. - This weekend is very long."

340
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:07,612
So?

341
00:45:09,946 --> 00:45:10,813
Let's go.

342
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:19,380
But is it only the two of us?

343
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:20,747
Should we take the whole
marriage procession?

344
00:45:20,814 --> 00:45:23,947
"Do you have to marry? Okay,
after some time."

345
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:26,400
"Rahul, you don't understand. - We
will stay in two different rooms."

346
00:45:29,615 --> 00:45:32,400
"And you, won't come in my room."

347
00:45:32,415 --> 00:45:34,015
Okay. You come in my room.

348
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:42,549
I am here.

349
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:46,949
What happened?

350
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:50,200
Rahul and I are going for a holiday for four days.
- What?

351
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:52,350
Four days.
- Yes.

352
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:55,017
I have got a holiday too.

353
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,184
I've been thinking about it
since such a long time.

354
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,400
To go to an island or somewhere
in the mountains.

355
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:12,685
"You are coming with us, aren't you?"

356
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:16,000
I am so happy. I am going
to pack right away.

357
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:34,320
You forgot two tee shirts outside.

358
00:46:34,486 --> 00:46:35,853
I put them in the bag.

359
00:46:46,987 --> 00:46:48,121
I will tell you later.

360
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:52,688
I couldn't refuse her.

361
00:46:57,121 --> 00:47:01,700
"Queen, should I keep
this bag too? Come."

362
00:47:02,955 --> 00:47:05,289
"Come Rahul, please. Come on."

363
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:38,792
"Sapna, do you remember?
- Yes?"

364
00:47:39,058 --> 00:47:40,958
We had come here with
Vipul and Paresh?

365
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,559
We'd worn masks and scared them?

366
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:45,825
"The two didn't understand
that it was us, isn't it?"

367
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:50,392
"We ran to our rooms, and they
were behind us. Scared!"

368
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,859
Please let us sleep in your room.

369
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:54,559
There is a ghost outside our room!

370
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,160
You remember that?

371
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,260
I will just come back.

372
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,427
"You look around, me too..."

373
00:48:30,896 --> 00:48:33,396
These boys have nice fun. Anywhere...

374
00:48:33,396 --> 00:48:36,829
...they just stand and do it.
- Yes. And we girls...

375
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:41,200
Oh! I have to go now too.
How far is the resort from here?

376
00:48:42,797 --> 00:48:46,097
There's a jungle around here.
- I'll come.

377
00:48:49,064 --> 00:48:51,200
You will go away with Sapna.

378
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:54,200
I am not that insolent.

379
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,999
"Looking at your mood, it seems that
you didn't like that I came."

380
00:48:57,398 --> 00:48:58,265
Why not?

381
00:48:58,365 --> 00:49:00,500
"If you had not come, we'd
die of loneliness."

382
00:49:00,531 --> 00:49:03,665
You nag nicely.
- I nag nicely to Tanya.

383
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:13,466
Is the resort really too far?
- I will be back.

384
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,600
My love!

385
00:49:50,535 --> 00:49:53,469
Just bring the sun
block from my room.

386
00:49:53,536 --> 00:49:56,200
"It is too warm out here, and
Sapna's feeling it too."

387
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:57,500
Please bring the sun block too.

388
00:49:57,969 --> 00:49:59,769
The key is right there.
At the reception.

389
00:50:04,403 --> 00:50:05,203
"Where, Rahul?"

390
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:07,037
Where are you going Rahul?

391
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:21,705
"Rahul, we should have brought
Tanya with us too."

392
00:50:21,771 --> 00:50:23,138
We have escaped from her
after so much difficulty!

393
00:50:32,105 --> 00:50:33,305
Where did these two go?

394
00:51:16,876 --> 00:51:18,442
We didn't know how the day passed.

395
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:21,443
"Isn't it, Sapna?"

396
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:26,043
"The sea, the open sky, love."

397
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:33,244
"What happened, Tanya?
You seem depressed."

398
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:34,277
"No, not at all."

399
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:37,999
Were you bored all alone all through the day?
- Not at all.

400
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:41,300
I like to spend time with myself.

401
00:51:42,478 --> 00:51:45,711
I thought that you didn't
like it without Sapna.

402
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:49,245
"And you took her with you
for that reason, isn't it?"

403
00:51:50,112 --> 00:51:52,878
No. I wanted to spend some
time with my Sapna.

404
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:56,245
"After all, I do have a
right on her time now."

405
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:00,579
You can spend time with her now.

406
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:03,200
"No, Tanya, please have a seat."

407
00:52:04,013 --> 00:52:06,080
I have to sleep early. I have
to go for a jog in the morning.

408
00:53:52,155 --> 00:53:53,021
"What happened, Rahul?"

409
00:53:53,588 --> 00:53:55,022
Why are you standing here all alone?

410
00:53:55,522 --> 00:53:57,688
"Nothing, just like that. - So c'mon."

411
00:53:57,688 --> 00:54:01,255
"We will go for a swim. - No,
I am not in the mood. You go."

412
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,856
Why? Has something happened to you?

413
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:04,122
Nothing has happened
to me. I'm fine.

414
00:54:04,189 --> 00:54:07,023
"Then, why? - Didn't I tell you that
nothing has happened to me?"

415
00:54:14,723 --> 00:54:16,323
"Please, go. I don't want
to hear anything."

416
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:21,690
I will do his 1-2-34.

417
00:59:40,263 --> 00:59:41,563
"Sapna, I am not feeling well."

418
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:47,163
"I have an aspirin. - Okay,
give it to me. - Come."

419
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:48,663
"Okay, come quickly."

420
00:59:49,763 --> 00:59:52,263
"I have a splitting head ache,
apply some balm too."

421
00:59:53,963 --> 00:59:55,663
"Rahul, we will meet tomorrow."

422
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,000
What is going between
the two of you?

423
01:01:00,334 --> 01:01:01,367
What do you mean?

424
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:03,534
"Whatever it is, there is only
friendship between you."

425
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:07,600
Tanya is just my friend.
- This friendship is abnormal.

426
01:01:08,634 --> 01:01:10,335
This friendship is standing
like a wall.

427
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:13,806
"Such a wall,
which I am not able to break."

428
01:01:13,968 --> 01:01:16,175
"I can't reach you!
- This is your misconception, Rahul."

429
01:01:16,735 --> 01:01:19,332
"Whatever I saw in the night,
wasn't a misconception."

430
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:20,402
It was the bloody truth!

431
01:01:21,374 --> 01:01:22,569
I sleep soundly in the night.

432
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:25,046
"You are still sleeping
soundly, Sapna."

433
01:01:25,703 --> 01:01:27,303
"I am talking about the night, Rahul."

434
01:01:27,469 --> 01:01:29,670
"Whenever I sleep, I
lose consciousness."

435
01:01:31,303 --> 01:01:33,370
"That means, whatever was happening..."

436
01:01:33,661 --> 01:01:34,865
"...in the night, was
happening in sleep?"

437
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:37,603
"What are you saying, Rahul?"

438
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:38,970
I am saying that the two of you...

439
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,223
...make love to each other at nights.

440
01:01:42,837 --> 01:01:45,537
"I mean, that I was just
suspecting it till now."

441
01:01:45,804 --> 01:01:48,654
"But now, I am sure that
you are lovers!"

442
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:52,105
"Please tell me, Sapna.
Please tell me."

443
01:01:52,343 --> 01:01:56,600
"Tell me, otherwise... otherwise,
I will leave you and go away."

444
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:59,181
"No, Rahul. Whatever happened,
happened only one night."

445
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,456
This happened in the third
year of college.

446
01:02:16,924 --> 01:02:18,110
The two of us...

447
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,938
...were returning from
a party one day.

448
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:22,007
We were drunk.

449
01:02:22,624 --> 01:02:24,196
Tanya took me to a friend's house...

450
01:02:24,598 --> 01:02:27,109
"...instead of the hostel,
which was empty."

451
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:45,014
Whatever happened yesterday...
- I don't know.

452
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:50,526
"Sapna, whatever happened yesterday,
we were drunk."

453
01:05:50,636 --> 01:05:53,296
"And on top of that, Rani
gave us so much of hash..."

454
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:55,415
...we weren't in our senses.

455
01:05:58,159 --> 01:05:59,756
But I...

456
01:06:04,243 --> 01:06:05,765
"What has happened to you, Sapna?"

457
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:09,359
Will you ruin our three year
old friendship for one night?

458
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:13,870
And I don't even remember anything.
Do you remember?

459
01:06:19,474 --> 01:06:22,483
I don't remember anything too.
- Enough.

460
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:28,532
"This won't happen ever
again, isn't it?"

461
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,710
We won't drink this much ever again.

462
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,200
We were drunk.

463
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:46,726
Do you know in other hostels...

464
01:06:47,286 --> 01:06:48,719
...in our hostel...

465
01:06:49,087 --> 01:06:51,008
...what goes on even
without drinking?

466
01:07:03,343 --> 01:07:05,812
"I don't quite remember
what happened, Rahul."

467
01:07:07,182 --> 01:07:10,206
Please don't give me such
a harsh punishment...

468
01:07:11,919 --> 01:07:13,928
...for just that one night.
Please don't leave me.

469
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:15,802
"Don't leave me, Rahul."

470
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:01,428
"What are you doing here, dude?
- I'm here on holiday, pal."

471
01:08:01,783 --> 01:08:03,905
"Alone?
- No, I was with a friend."

472
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:07,171
"Yes, a girl!"

473
01:08:07,563 --> 01:08:09,487
"After waking up she says
to me, ' Let's get married'."

474
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:10,911
I asked her to get lost.

475
01:08:12,572 --> 01:08:14,678
You'll never mend your ways.
- What can I say?

476
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:16,235
Never! For whom should
I mend my ways?

477
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:21,024
What about you?
- I'm just here with two girls.

478
01:08:21,646 --> 01:08:25,546
"With two girls! You are happening,
dude and a stud."

479
01:08:25,546 --> 01:08:27,472
It was you in the college.
One is my girlfriend.

480
01:08:27,623 --> 01:08:29,469
The other is her friend.

481
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:32,007
Okay! Do I have a chance
with the other?

482
01:08:32,323 --> 01:08:37,913
"With her...
you have a chance with her, pal."

483
01:08:38,382 --> 01:08:39,543
There's definitely a chance.

484
01:08:40,968 --> 01:08:43,298
"She's damn hot! You go for her, pal."

485
01:08:44,012 --> 01:08:45,496
It will be fun.

486
01:08:49,953 --> 01:08:53,011
"He's Randeep, we met on
the beach while jogging."

487
01:08:53,306 --> 01:08:54,959
He was alone so I thought
I should invite...

488
01:08:54,971 --> 01:08:56,489
...him to have dinner with us.

489
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,705
She's my girlfriend.

490
01:09:03,808 --> 01:09:06,224
"Randeep, are you Rahul's friend?"

491
01:09:06,224 --> 01:09:08,491
"No, actually we met
on the beach and..."

492
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:11,830
...we were three so I thought
we should have one more.

493
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:13,873
And Tanya would
also have a company.

494
01:09:14,665 --> 01:09:17,871
"The thing is that, Sapna
and I go out, at times..."

495
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:21,684
...and you stay alone. He's
alone and so are you.

496
01:09:21,684 --> 01:09:23,470
So I thought you two should meet.

497
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:26,790
"I had told you earlier too,
I like my own company."

498
01:09:27,556 --> 01:09:30,620
Or is it that you don't like
to be accompanied by men?

499
01:09:31,087 --> 01:09:36,109
I never said that.
- So let's have a date tomorrow?

500
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:04,503
"Baby, tonight we'll
have loads of fun."

501
01:10:10,062 --> 01:10:16,251
"You know, since college days girls
were not able to resist me."

502
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:21,901
Really? - And if they would then
I won't leave them alone.

503
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:32,431
I have bedded so many girls
in my life...

504
01:10:33,754 --> 01:10:40,126
...that you must have not eated
as many mangoes in your life.

505
01:10:40,284 --> 01:10:42,066
Anyways I'm allergic to mangoes.

506
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:48,347
"Poor thing! Anyway, you must
have understood what I meant."

507
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:49,577
Of course!

508
01:10:53,025 --> 01:11:00,634
"So tonight, we'll drink all
night and stay awake."

509
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,161
So you'll keep me awake
the whole night?

510
01:11:04,952 --> 01:11:06,902
My intentions similar.

511
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:31,609
"But why? Randeep, tell me
what happened to you."

512
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,744
"Nothing, buddy!
- It looks like all your bones are broken."

513
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:39,650
"It's fine, don't worry.
- But what happened?"

514
01:11:40,055 --> 01:11:42,709
I fell from the lobby... I fell from upstairs.
- From upstairs?

515
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:46,112
"You, please go away.
- But where are you going with your bags?"

516
01:11:46,285 --> 01:11:47,885
I'm going away. My vacation is over.

517
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:50,472
But Tanya is waiting for you. -
Let her. I don't like Tanya.

518
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,443
"No! - No, who's Tanya.
I don't want Tanya."

519
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:51,686
What?

520
01:11:52,443 --> 01:11:55,331
I had made such a good plan.
Only two days are left.

521
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:57,419
"I'm going, pal. My vacation is over."

522
01:11:57,419 --> 01:11:59,014
What do you mean it's over?
I won't let you go.

523
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,583
Go away from me!
Why are you after me?

524
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:08,690
Didn't you go out with her last
night? Did she beat you up?

525
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:15,776
"Lower the window pane.
- Come on, driver, let's go."

526
01:12:18,526 --> 01:12:20,721
But you were a stud.
- To hell with the stud.

527
01:12:32,914 --> 01:12:38,247
"I got rid of your friend.
He is your friend, isn't it?"

528
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,516
And the vacations are also over.

529
01:12:50,253 --> 01:12:53,538
"Rahul, we had gone for a
4-day weekend holiday."

530
01:12:53,538 --> 01:12:57,425
Why are we returning in 3 days?
- 3 days were enough.

531
01:13:01,694 --> 01:13:04,975
Vacations are over and we
are back to our city.

532
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:10,032
"Tanya, we had promised
that we wouldn't drink."

533
01:13:10,418 --> 01:13:11,396
Just for tonight.

534
01:15:28,736 --> 01:15:30,658
I must do something.

535
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,059
I have to get Sapna
separated from Tanya.

536
01:15:34,203 --> 01:15:35,705
I have to get her out of that house.

537
01:15:40,947 --> 01:15:43,396
"Rahul, where are you taking me?"

538
01:15:48,727 --> 01:15:50,389
"Tell me, where are you
taking me, please?"

539
01:16:00,241 --> 01:16:01,816
But why have you brought me home?

540
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,993
If I tell you everything then
how will it remain a surprise?

541
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:10,469
If you don't come how will mother...

542
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:15,323
That is my gorgeous mother.
- Mother?

543
01:16:19,064 --> 01:16:20,677
"Mom, this is Sapna."

544
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,825
"Greetings, auntie!
- Greetings, my child."

545
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:36,628
"How are you, child?
- I'm fine."

546
01:16:37,016 --> 01:16:39,943
"Come we'll sit here. Come!
- Come, mom!"

547
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,779
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I wouldn't have worn these clothes.

548
01:16:48,117 --> 01:16:51,312
"Sit comfortably, child.
- Yes! - It will tear up."

549
01:16:55,314 --> 01:16:57,791
What do you do?
- Some thing in fashion designing...

550
01:16:57,791 --> 01:16:59,348
She also models.

551
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:04,443
You are a model? That's
why you are so thin.

552
01:17:04,573 --> 01:17:07,969
"No! - She eats very much,
even more than I do."

553
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:13,935
"Come, child, sit next to me.
- Yes, go, child... Sapna."

554
01:17:17,345 --> 01:17:19,888
"Rahul has told me about
your birth date, year..."

555
01:17:19,888 --> 01:17:23,430
...and about everything. Back
in London I got your...

556
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,618
...horoscope made from our priest.

557
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,212
"You two want to get married,
don't you?"

558
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:30,629
"Mom, she's dying to get married."

559
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:37,866
"Child, I have decided on an
auspicious day after 3 months."

560
01:17:37,866 --> 01:17:41,810
3 months... will pass in a jiffy.

561
01:17:42,615 --> 01:17:45,649
But there's a condition. - What?

562
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:49,849
You won't stay alone but stay
with us for these 3 months.

563
01:17:49,849 --> 01:17:53,784
This is very necessary.
I mean you can stay...

564
01:17:53,784 --> 01:17:56,442
...in mother's room and
I'll stay in my room.

565
01:17:56,983 --> 01:18:01,484
I won't keep you as a daughter-in
- law but as my own daughter.

566
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:06,384
"And what about me, mom? - You?
You are now a step son to me."

567
01:18:06,896 --> 01:18:08,806
I have met my daughter now.

568
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:13,802
Mom! - Shut up! Always acting!

569
01:18:24,989 --> 01:18:26,437
"Today, I met Rahul's mom."

570
01:18:28,865 --> 01:18:30,026
His mother is here?

571
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:32,899
"Yes, she came all the way from
London only to meet me."

572
01:18:39,724 --> 01:18:41,249
So early?
- Yes!

573
01:18:41,927 --> 01:18:44,799
The date has been decided
of after 3 months.

574
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:47,362
"But Rahul's mom, insisted that
I should stay with her..."

575
01:18:47,362 --> 01:18:48,835
...for these three months.

576
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:53,773
"You mean, you'll shift right away?"

577
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:57,485
She is Rahul's mom.
How will I say no to her?

578
01:18:57,485 --> 01:18:59,427
After all she's going
to be my mother-in-law.

579
01:19:01,766 --> 01:19:03,055
Yes!

580
01:19:04,351 --> 01:19:05,874
I'll come often.

581
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:09,091
"And you know what, I'll
introduce you to his mom."

582
01:19:09,091 --> 01:19:11,629
So you can also stay
with us on weekends.

583
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:21,501
"But you are not going today, aren't you?
- No!"

584
01:19:25,184 --> 01:19:29,121
"Come, let's call up some friends
and have a farewell party."

585
01:19:31,426 --> 01:19:35,359
"Anyway, from tomorrow this
house will become very lonely."

586
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:30,177
Tanya! What happened to her?

587
01:20:41,441 --> 01:20:46,268
You are very sick.
- Let me die.

588
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:52,085
"What will I do all alone,
without you?"

589
01:20:55,490 --> 01:21:00,972
"Tanya, are you crazy? Can
I leave you like this?"

590
01:21:05,082 --> 01:21:07,132
"You won't go.
- No, Tanya."

591
01:21:09,794 --> 01:21:15,976
Give me some time. A little.

592
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:21,092
You'll go away after 3 months.

593
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:28,785
"Tanya, okay. I won't leave
you and go anywhere."

594
01:21:29,295 --> 01:21:32,005
Don't leave me.

595
01:21:36,755 --> 01:21:38,095
You'll stay with Tanya for 3 months?

596
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,010
"Rahul, try to understand."

597
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:46,327
What should I understand?
That you are disagreeing...

598
01:21:46,327 --> 01:21:47,859
...to Mom and that due to that Tanya.

599
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:50,524
"Rahul, Tanya is not well.
- So what if she is not well?"

600
01:21:50,609 --> 01:21:52,929
"She has fever, isn't it?
She'll be fine in 2 days."

601
01:21:53,264 --> 01:21:55,322
Tanya and I are staying together
since the past 5 years.

602
01:21:55,322 --> 01:21:57,204
And to leave her all of
a sudden like this...

603
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:58,448
"...I really don't know, it
doesn't feels good."

604
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:01,062
"Sapna, friendship
doesn't mean that..."

605
01:22:01,062 --> 01:22:02,567
...you will stay together
for the whole life.

606
01:22:04,016 --> 01:22:05,935
We are going to stay together
for the rest of our lives.

607
01:22:05,935 --> 01:22:07,266
It's just a matter of 3 months.

608
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:11,176
You have given 3 months to her.
So what do you want from me?

609
01:22:15,943 --> 01:22:18,284
I have seen lots of friendship
in this world.

610
01:22:18,619 --> 01:22:20,788
"But your friendship,
I just don't seem to understand."

611
01:22:22,785 --> 01:22:24,590
"Okay, let's make a deal."

612
01:22:24,642 --> 01:22:26,205
We will meet each other every day.

613
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:29,897
As soon as you finish your office
I'll be with you. Like this.

614
01:22:30,634 --> 01:22:32,258
And you'll sleep with
her in the night.

615
01:22:33,177 --> 01:22:34,856
"We both sleep at night, together."

616
01:22:36,688 --> 01:22:40,290
"Rahul, you are getting jealous
as if Tanya is my boyfriend."

617
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,861
"Her behavior is just
like that, Sapna."

618
01:22:42,574 --> 01:22:45,035
"Don't talk rubbish, please.
- Remember this..."

619
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:48,458
...suspicion once aroused
remains for the entire life.

620
01:22:48,689 --> 01:22:51,209
"Rahul, we'll stay together
very happily like this..."

621
01:22:51,209 --> 01:22:56,921
"...for the rest of our lives. You
explain it to mom, please."

622
01:23:06,312 --> 01:23:10,165
"Rahul, my son, when Sapna is
not staying here then..."

623
01:23:10,165 --> 01:23:14,379
...what's the need of me
to stay here for 3 months.

624
01:23:14,379 --> 01:23:18,375
I'll go back to London. And
whatever you decide...

625
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:20,702
...just inform us about it.
If you want to get married...

626
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:23,800
...in India then we'll
come in August.

627
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,222
And if you want it to
be in London then...

628
01:23:26,222 --> 01:23:28,752
...your father will make
all the arrangements.

629
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:32,051
"Rahul, my child, I came
here from London..."

630
01:23:32,051 --> 01:23:34,051
"...only after you called
me here, isn't it."

631
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:38,470
"But, if Sapna doesn't want
to stay here then..."

632
01:23:40,101 --> 01:23:41,678
"Don't be disappointed, son."

633
01:23:41,738 --> 01:23:44,489
"Okay listen, get my ticket for me."

634
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,915
"You are a great friend, Sapna."

635
01:23:58,096 --> 01:24:02,460
"Rahul, it's very difficult
to get such good friends."

636
01:24:04,543 --> 01:24:06,797
It's also very difficult to get
a girlfriend like Sapna.

637
01:24:08,161 --> 01:24:11,866
And very soon Ms. Sapna is going
to be Mrs. Sapna Chaudhary.

638
01:24:11,866 --> 01:24:14,849
"Isn't it, sweetie?
- So did Sapna tell you as to..."

639
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:16,728
...what will she give you as dowry?

640
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:22,247
What is there to say?
I can understand it well.

641
01:24:22,464 --> 01:24:25,125
I don't think you like
this dowry very much.

642
01:24:28,244 --> 01:24:33,192
Why not? But this is different
that we'll meet less after...

643
01:24:33,192 --> 01:24:35,425
...marriage because we'll shift
to London after marriage.

644
01:24:35,927 --> 01:24:37,845
Maybe then we'll meet regularly.

645
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:44,808
Meaning?
- I mean to say two days ago my boss was just...

646
01:24:44,808 --> 01:24:47,166
...telling me that they are sifting
me to their branch in London.

647
01:24:57,798 --> 01:24:58,904
"What is this, Sapna?"

648
01:25:00,389 --> 01:25:02,867
"Do you know, Rahul, when
we are alone at home..."

649
01:25:02,867 --> 01:25:04,140
...then she roams around
just like this...

650
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:08,790
And sometimes when she goes
for sunbathing then too...

651
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:12,031
I tell her what if someone takes
a picture from a helicopter...

652
01:25:12,031 --> 01:25:13,242
...after all she is a model.

653
01:25:18,242 --> 01:25:20,447
"Where are you going?
- Rahul, where are we going?"

654
01:25:20,447 --> 01:25:21,910
Where are you two going?

655
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:24,768
Where are you two going?

656
01:25:25,635 --> 01:25:28,886
Alibaug! - When are you coming back?

657
01:30:31,506 --> 01:30:34,619
"Your hair look like... -
I look good, isn't it?"

658
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:37,272
"Yes, but...
- How was your night?"

659
01:30:40,631 --> 01:30:47,659
Now it's his right. If he takes
you away for a day or a week.

660
01:30:51,806 --> 01:30:53,907
And anyway we are getting married.

661
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:56,352
And I don't want him
to be angry with me.

662
01:32:25,471 --> 01:32:28,436
At least you must have seen
the attacker's face.

663
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:33,182
"I have already told you, inspector
I couldn't see him at all."

664
01:32:33,182 --> 01:32:35,657
Or else I would...
- Do you have any enemies?

665
01:32:35,657 --> 01:32:38,928
"Sir, what does he need enemies for?"

666
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,723
He only knows to love.

667
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:43,996
Even love can cause enmity.

668
01:32:46,404 --> 01:32:49,609
"Rahul, what happened to you?
Who did this to you?"

669
01:32:49,609 --> 01:32:53,148
Nothing happened.
- Someone tried to kill him.

670
01:32:53,148 --> 01:32:55,217
"And he says nothing happened.
- Let it be, pal."

671
01:32:55,217 --> 01:32:58,356
Just lie down and let me talk.

672
01:32:58,447 --> 01:33:02,330
"Who are you?
- She's Sapna, my girlfriend."

673
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:06,818
Is it like this that your
father or your relative...

674
01:33:06,818 --> 01:33:09,227
...is unhappy with your relationship.

675
01:33:09,227 --> 01:33:11,515
And may be they are responsible
for the attack.

676
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:15,735
"Inspector, I don't have any
relative in this city."

677
01:33:15,729 --> 01:33:18,675
Just a friend is there. That's me.

678
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:26,447
"Sapna told me that you are
here, injured."

679
01:33:27,038 --> 01:33:28,705
What happened to you?

680
01:33:30,097 --> 01:33:32,256
"So sweet, you brought flowers."

681
01:33:36,347 --> 01:33:39,405
"By the way, did you find
out who attacked you?"

682
01:33:40,096 --> 01:33:42,408
You can tell at least
something about him.

683
01:33:45,236 --> 01:33:50,746
That man definitely
knew kick-boxing.

684
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:55,313
A man who knows kick-boxing.

685
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:59,048
"Inspector, I don't think it would
be very difficult to find him."

686
01:33:59,736 --> 01:34:03,720
But life threatening attack can
only mean personal enmity.

687
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:08,826
"But Rahul, you have no
enemies in this city."

688
01:34:10,134 --> 01:34:11,955
I don't have any special
friends too.

689
01:34:16,761 --> 01:34:20,257
"According to your theory it can be
some old personal enmity, right?"

690
01:34:20,257 --> 01:34:21,630
What do you mean?

691
01:34:24,212 --> 01:34:28,900
If Rahul had an ex-girlfriend who...
- What the hell..?

692
01:34:31,372 --> 01:34:33,009
Who must be responsible
for the attack on you...

693
01:34:35,328 --> 01:34:36,902
How many girlfriends do you have?

694
01:34:36,987 --> 01:34:39,154
"I have only one, inspector.
She is Sapna."

695
01:34:39,154 --> 01:34:40,584
Then what is she saying?

696
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:46,277
I was just saying that the kick
- boxer should be caught very soon.

697
01:34:46,277 --> 01:34:49,286
"Are you hiding something from
us, Mr. Rahul Chaudhary?"

698
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,745
No!

699
01:34:56,736 --> 01:35:00,983
"Tanya, I wanted to ask you something
since the last night. - Sure, go ahead."

700
01:35:00,983 --> 01:35:04,149
"That day, at the hospital
you mentioned something..."

701
01:35:04,149 --> 01:35:07,939
...about Rahul's ex-girlfriend
in front of the inspector.

702
01:35:09,006 --> 01:35:11,904
"You couldn't gather the courage to
ask this, the whole of night?"

703
01:35:15,356 --> 01:35:18,826
I didn't find it out. Someone who
knows Rahul said this to me.

704
01:35:18,826 --> 01:35:20,631
What does he know?

705
01:35:20,766 --> 01:35:23,480
That Rahul had an ex-girlfriend
named Kajal.

706
01:35:23,901 --> 01:35:30,306
Whom he left for you.
- He had a girlfriend before...

707
01:35:30,306 --> 01:35:32,893
Kajal's brothers are ruffians.

708
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:36,053
That's why I was hinting
the inspector that...

709
01:35:36,053 --> 01:35:38,018
...maybe Rahul was attacked by them.

710
01:35:38,018 --> 01:35:39,933
But if it was Kajal or
any other of his girlfriend...

711
01:35:39,933 --> 01:35:41,469
...then he would have
told me earlier.

712
01:35:42,071 --> 01:35:44,035
"Rahul doesn't hides anything
from me, Tanya."

713
01:35:44,035 --> 01:35:47,035
He is not as simple as you...
- He's a very honest guy.

714
01:35:47,574 --> 01:35:51,923
You don't know these men.
You don't know.

715
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,215
"What happened, Tanya?"

716
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:05,958
I have seen such a cruel
side of these men...

717
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:08,959
What?
...you won't understand. Let it be.

718
01:36:09,428 --> 01:36:10,796
"Tell me, Tanya."

719
01:36:13,505 --> 01:36:18,714
"It's when I was a child, Sapna.
- Yes, tell me."

720
01:36:18,775 --> 01:36:23,410
I was very young.
- What had happened?

721
01:36:24,327 --> 01:36:27,743
There was a boy in my neighborhood.

722
01:36:28,122 --> 01:36:33,278
He was somewhere Rahul's age.
- So?

723
01:36:36,012 --> 01:36:42,333
"I was just 7-8 years old.
- Tell me, Tanya."

724
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:44,354
He used to give me chocolates.

725
01:36:48,284 --> 01:36:50,022
He had a wife.

726
01:36:52,718 --> 01:36:57,388
"One day, my mother passed away."

727
01:37:01,044 --> 01:37:02,838
Father used to go to work.

728
01:37:05,146 --> 01:37:09,929
After returning from school
I used to sit at his place.

729
01:37:11,046 --> 01:37:12,740
...and wait for my father.

730
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:21,107
"And one day, when his
wife was not at home..."

731
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,427
...he very lovingly
sat me on his laps.

732
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:32,719
And started to play with me.

733
01:37:33,771 --> 01:37:39,333
Then he started to touch
me very strangely.

734
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:53,022
"After that he made me do something,
which made me cry."

735
01:37:57,230 --> 01:38:03,434
He... then gave me a chocolate.

736
01:38:04,988 --> 01:38:07,513
"He very lovingly, told me..."

737
01:38:08,495 --> 01:38:10,397
...that I shouldn't say
anything to anyone.

738
01:38:12,078 --> 01:38:16,525
Or else he would throw
me off the terrace.

739
01:38:20,446 --> 01:38:25,898
"After that, whenever he wished..."

740
01:38:29,171 --> 01:38:31,967
...he would do dirty things to me.

741
01:38:36,357 --> 01:38:38,623
I hate these men!

742
01:38:39,845 --> 01:38:48,393
That's why I'm telling you to stay
away from Rahul. Stay away.

743
01:39:10,747 --> 01:39:12,425
Let's go for a movie today.

744
01:39:12,772 --> 01:39:15,174
These two and a half months are
not going to be easy.

745
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:18,966
Where is your boyfriend?

746
01:39:21,861 --> 01:39:23,443
Girlfriend!

747
01:39:23,884 --> 01:39:26,152
"Okay, let's meet at 6.30,
at Bay Waters."

748
01:39:26,152 --> 01:39:28,052
We'll go for a movie from there.

749
01:39:36,069 --> 01:39:39,683
Sapna, I hope you remember that...
...we have to go to Sonia's birthday party.

750
01:39:39,929 --> 01:39:45,845
Oh yes! But I have made plans
with Rahul for a movie.

751
01:39:53,257 --> 01:39:56,101
"Okay, we'll invite him too."

752
01:40:52,427 --> 01:40:56,573
I am calling to invite you at a
party in the evening at 8.30...

753
01:40:56,614 --> 01:40:59,639
"...this is at Bagha beach,
bungalow no. 16..."

754
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:02,330
...if you could please make it
then Sapna and me both are...

755
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:04,871
...going to be there and spend
the evening together.

756
01:41:05,466 --> 01:41:11,518
And if you could please cancel
your program for the movie.

757
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:28,309
My cell phone is not working.
Is there no network here?

758
01:41:28,309 --> 01:41:30,978
- Even mine is not working.
It wouldn't catch the network here.

759
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:50,361
Sapna is not enjoying.

760
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:54,911
It's the result of being in love.
- Being in love?

761
01:41:54,911 --> 01:41:56,477
That too with a boy.

762
01:42:10,755 --> 01:42:14,450
"Sir, there's no one at home.
- Where are they? - At Bagha beach."

763
01:42:23,173 --> 01:42:26,377
Rahul didn't come and even
my phone is not working.

764
01:42:26,585 --> 01:42:29,480
He'll be here.
I have left a message.

765
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,310
"At his office, on his voice mail."

766
01:42:32,961 --> 01:42:35,213
Till then enjoy the evening with me.

767
01:43:48,209 --> 01:43:50,933
I want to end this relationship.
- What?

768
01:43:52,461 --> 01:43:56,105
"I don't think we two can stay
together, happily. - But why, Rahul?"

769
01:43:56,105 --> 01:44:00,139
Why! You are asking why?

770
01:44:01,373 --> 01:44:04,199
Don't you have a little sense?
Can't you see what's happening with us?

771
01:44:04,199 --> 01:44:05,583
"What has happened to you, Rahul?"

772
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:08,083
You were invited at the party.
But did you come?

773
01:44:08,157 --> 01:44:11,373
I was invited at the party!
And who invited me?

774
01:44:11,373 --> 01:44:14,773
Tanya had left a message in front of me.
Don't take Tanya's name.

775
01:44:14,807 --> 01:44:17,839
Why do you hate Tanya so much?
Because she...

776
01:44:17,906 --> 01:44:20,373
She is my friend.
- She is not your friend.

777
01:44:21,173 --> 01:44:24,812
"She's your husband.
One, who controls you."

778
01:44:24,812 --> 01:44:27,597
She's your lover who
has a hold on you...

779
01:44:27,597 --> 01:44:29,556
...as if she owns your life.

780
01:44:31,616 --> 01:44:34,633
You are crazy!
- I've been made crazy.

781
01:44:34,836 --> 01:44:36,312
And that too by your girlfriend.
She is not your...

782
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,911
"...girlfriend, she is a guy."

783
01:44:41,681 --> 01:44:43,570
That's what I'm trying to say.

784
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:44,686
But remember this...

785
01:44:44,686 --> 01:44:46,829
...she will never allow
you to love anyone.

786
01:44:46,829 --> 01:44:49,719
Tanya only wants our happiness.
- It's not possible.

787
01:44:49,719 --> 01:44:51,130
Because she only wants you.

788
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:53,740
I'm just a villain for her.

789
01:44:53,972 --> 01:44:56,736
"You have really gone mad, isn't it?
- Anyone would have."

790
01:44:56,736 --> 01:44:58,245
Anyone would have because...

791
01:44:58,245 --> 01:45:00,146
...a love triangle like this
has never happened before.

792
01:45:00,146 --> 01:45:02,487
"And we both are trapped
in it. Trapped, totally."

793
01:45:02,487 --> 01:45:05,832
You are trapped. Because you're
jealous of our friendship.

794
01:45:06,813 --> 01:45:09,232
This friend will never
let you get married.

795
01:45:09,232 --> 01:45:11,214
"Why not, Rahul?"

796
01:45:11,214 --> 01:45:14,190
Because she won't let you live
peacefully even after marriage.

797
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:16,728
You can go to any corner
of this world. Anywhere!

798
01:45:16,728 --> 01:45:20,056
She'll follow you. She
won't let you live.

799
01:45:21,122 --> 01:45:24,765
She would only pray that your
marriage is a disaster.

800
01:45:24,765 --> 01:45:28,797
"In fact, she'll pray that
your husband dies."

801
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:35,687
That's why I think only
she attacked me.

802
01:45:43,569 --> 01:45:45,867
You want to hide something else.

803
01:45:45,867 --> 01:45:49,825
I don't need to hide anything
but she does.

804
01:45:49,825 --> 01:45:52,854
You want to hide your
ex-girlfriend Kajal.

805
01:45:55,281 --> 01:45:57,230
Kajal wasn't my ex-girlfriend.

806
01:45:57,534 --> 01:46:00,932
But Tanya is definitely your girlfriend.
- What?

807
01:46:00,932 --> 01:46:03,906
"Yes! And I perfectly understand
everything, Sapna."

808
01:46:03,906 --> 01:46:06,831
When you both were
dancing last night.

809
01:46:06,831 --> 01:46:10,319
It was not like any college games.
This game is still on.

810
01:46:11,421 --> 01:46:14,629
"Yes, you two love each
other, don't you?"

811
01:46:17,887 --> 01:46:22,459
"You need me, I know.
But you also need her."

812
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:25,125
You can't sleep alone in the night.

813
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:27,905
That's why you sleep
with your girlfriend.

814
01:46:31,215 --> 01:46:33,348
That's why you didn't come home.

815
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,166
Even when mother was here.
Because had you come...

816
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:40,701
...then your relationship with
Tanya would have ended.

817
01:46:40,701 --> 01:46:42,445
Because how much she needs you...

818
01:46:42,445 --> 01:46:44,675
...l'm sure you too
need her as much.

819
01:46:45,006 --> 01:46:48,748
I have told you so many times
that Tanya is only a friend.

820
01:46:49,682 --> 01:46:53,536
Then you have to decide today
between your friend and your love.

821
01:46:55,849 --> 01:47:00,717
No! Because after loving you I will
never break that friendship.

822
01:47:00,717 --> 01:47:04,663
Because whatever you are saying
about Tanya is wrong.

823
01:47:04,994 --> 01:47:10,093
And I'll never break that friendship.
- Okay!

824
01:47:10,930 --> 01:47:15,978
One day you will realize the truth
but it'll be too late by then.

825
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:18,924
Because I have decided to leave.

826
01:47:18,924 --> 01:47:22,919
I'm returning to London
after selling everything off.

827
01:47:22,919 --> 01:47:26,264
"My cars, my house, everything."

828
01:47:27,003 --> 01:47:28,913
That's why I told you
that it's necessary to meet.

829
01:47:28,913 --> 01:47:30,281
For the last time.

830
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,551
What happened?

831
01:48:11,637 --> 01:48:18,368
Rahul... - What did Rahul do? -
Rahul broke our relationship.

832
01:48:24,267 --> 01:48:25,758
It was bound to happen.

833
01:48:28,054 --> 01:48:30,370
I had told you I couldn't
see you crying.

834
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:33,686
Isn't it? And it happened?

835
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:38,355
"Don't worry, baby. I'm here."

836
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:40,041
I'm here for you.

837
01:48:45,046 --> 01:48:46,601
"Can I tell you something, Rahul?"

838
01:48:47,569 --> 01:48:52,843
"These girls are all traitors.
You tell me, why am I ruined?"

839
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:56,741
To hell with both of them.
Let them live together.

840
01:48:57,143 --> 01:48:59,741
I'm going to London.
I will forget that there...

841
01:48:59,741 --> 01:49:00,998
...was any Sapna in my life.

842
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:18,020
That's why I have brought
you out from the house.

843
01:49:40,711 --> 01:49:44,644
Let's go somewhere else.
- No!

844
01:49:46,504 --> 01:49:50,639
Give me a paper. - Paper?
- A blank paper!

845
01:50:10,946 --> 01:50:13,196
It's good that I found
both of you here.

846
01:50:13,196 --> 01:50:17,294
"Actually, tomorrow night I'm
going to London. Forever!"

847
01:50:43,485 --> 01:50:45,664
"Stop crying, Sapna."

848
01:51:13,192 --> 01:51:16,633
"Look, we both are alone."

849
01:51:17,466 --> 01:51:21,732
Me for you and you for me.

850
01:51:22,939 --> 01:51:27,794
Didn't I say that all men are alike?

851
01:51:32,327 --> 01:51:34,022
"Leave me alone, Tanya."

852
01:51:37,561 --> 01:51:40,098
"Hey, what's there to cry now?"

853
01:51:41,776 --> 01:51:44,415
"By the way, that man has left."

854
01:51:46,299 --> 01:51:48,150
Come into my arms.

855
01:51:49,977 --> 01:51:53,452
"Tonight, we'll sleep
together freely."

856
01:51:54,037 --> 01:51:57,916
"By the way, I have not slept for many nights.
- Why?"

857
01:51:57,916 --> 01:52:04,390
Why? How could I sleep
when I knew that...

858
01:52:05,703 --> 01:52:09,068
...he was taking you
away from me forever.

859
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:14,162
Would this thought ever let me sleep?
Not even for a second.

860
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:20,565
That's why we had to be separated.
- Separated?

861
01:52:21,227 --> 01:52:22,718
Why would we separate?

862
01:52:25,098 --> 01:52:28,418
"You have seen a man's love.
Isn't it, Sapna?"

863
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,005
You won't do it again.

864
01:52:32,211 --> 01:52:33,841
I am here to love you.

865
01:52:40,065 --> 01:52:44,865
There are no such needs that one
girl cannot fulfill of another girl.

866
01:52:50,113 --> 01:52:52,536
That means... that means
you were trying to...

867
01:52:52,536 --> 01:52:54,170
...separate me from Rahul
from the beginning.

868
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:59,118
He was not the one for you.
- That's why you always created...

869
01:52:59,118 --> 01:53:01,338
...misunderstandings
between Rahul and me.

870
01:53:02,828 --> 01:53:05,011
That night when we
went to the disco...

871
01:53:05,526 --> 01:53:07,298
"...you didn't call him, did you?"

872
01:53:07,788 --> 01:53:12,014
"Yes, I called him.
- Lies! You are lying."

873
01:53:12,839 --> 01:53:15,362
You always gave him the impression...

874
01:53:15,362 --> 01:53:16,880
...that we were having
something between us.

875
01:53:17,895 --> 01:53:23,427
Yes! I admit that I did it. Okay.

876
01:53:25,544 --> 01:53:27,801
Aren't you happy? Tell me.

877
01:53:27,878 --> 01:53:33,441
The eyes and the lips on which
only I had the right...

878
01:53:34,482 --> 01:53:36,296
...he was trying to get that.

879
01:53:38,431 --> 01:53:41,846
I wished that I would kill him.

880
01:53:47,771 --> 01:53:51,352
I should have told you before
how much I loved you.

881
01:53:51,352 --> 01:53:53,067
Then all this wouldn't
have happened.

882
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:55,928
Leave me. Let me go from here.

883
01:53:56,236 --> 01:53:59,642
How much will you fight?
Where will you go?

884
01:53:59,932 --> 01:54:01,289
This is love.

885
01:54:03,096 --> 01:54:08,340
He already left.
- He's not going today.

886
01:54:08,536 --> 01:54:10,125
He'll leave tomorrow.

887
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:17,817
Rahul secretly gave a letter
to me at the restaurant.

888
01:54:19,826 --> 01:54:22,045
He was so right about you.

889
01:54:25,681 --> 01:54:30,557
My lover! My husband!
What do you think of yourself?

890
01:54:32,847 --> 01:54:35,070
I had received so many
warning signals.

891
01:54:37,085 --> 01:54:41,697
I'm going to him now.
I'm going to him.

892
01:54:44,979 --> 01:54:48,838
"You can't go anywhere. I can't
live without you, Sapna."

893
01:54:48,838 --> 01:54:51,463
"Let me go, Tanya. Let me go."

894
01:54:51,463 --> 03:49:42,253
Henceforth you will
never see him again.

895
01:55:04,205 --> 01:55:05,221
Never!

896
01:55:25,044 --> 01:55:25,881
You?

897
01:55:42,884 --> 01:55:44,005
Speak!

898
01:55:51,259 --> 01:55:52,897
"What is this new game, now?"

899
01:55:54,548 --> 01:55:59,831
It's not a game.
- I separated Sapna from you.

900
01:56:02,524 --> 01:56:04,675
I have realized my mistake today.

901
01:56:06,754 --> 01:56:08,234
And why did you do that?

902
01:56:11,503 --> 01:56:13,733
I loved Sapna.

903
01:56:16,274 --> 01:56:17,808
You came between us.

904
01:56:20,089 --> 01:56:21,972
So it was true.
- Yes!

905
01:56:25,792 --> 01:56:26,972
I'm a lesbian.

906
01:56:34,822 --> 01:56:36,956
I boy trapped in a body of a girl.

907
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:44,081
I wanted that you and Sapna
should be together.

908
01:56:45,955 --> 01:56:47,282
But I lost.

909
01:56:54,668 --> 01:56:56,904
I'm sorry for that mistake.

910
01:57:28,265 --> 01:57:31,199
You are here. I was bringing water...

911
01:57:43,868 --> 01:57:47,538
Scoundrel! That night
I had attacked you.

912
01:58:01,318 --> 01:58:02,905
What's wrong with you?

913
01:58:05,967 --> 01:58:07,960
Are you out of your senses?

914
01:58:11,117 --> 01:58:13,497
Enough! Enough of all this.

915
01:58:53,948 --> 01:58:56,377
You are crazy! Crazy!

916
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:59,314
I'll kill you.

917
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:59,854
Men had tortured me
from my childhood.

918
02:00:01,863 --> 02:00:03,822
I hate this gender!

919
02:00:18,563 --> 02:00:33,056
These winds are moist!

920
02:00:34,948 --> 02:00:36,954
"You had touched Sapna by
these hands, hadn't you?"

921
02:00:40,246 --> 02:00:43,263
Hadn't you touched my delicate
Sapna by these hands?

922
02:00:45,663 --> 02:00:49,235
"Is Mr. Rahul at home?
- Yes, he is. - He is?"

923
02:01:11,352 --> 02:01:14,192
Let him die.

924
02:01:15,803 --> 02:01:18,071
What men know about love?

925
02:01:34,589 --> 02:01:37,224
"I did all of this for you, my love."

926
02:01:38,934 --> 02:01:40,783
And you say you hate me?

927
02:01:57,555 --> 02:01:59,854
"Did you get hurt, my love?"

928
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:16,172
Now I'll show you how death
looks in his eyes.

929
02:02:58,807 --> 02:02:59,894
Careful!

930
02:03:07,606 --> 02:03:09,044
You were right.

931
02:03:45,769 --> 02:03:49,021
"Enough, Sapna! Enough!"
