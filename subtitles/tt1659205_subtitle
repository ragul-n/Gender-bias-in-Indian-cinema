1
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:54,083
We want freedom!
We want freedom!

2
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,916
-We want to leave India!
-We want freedom!

3
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,583
Even if you shoot us!
Even if you jail us!

4
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,291
Even if you beat us up!

5
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,500
-We will show them!
-We want freedom!

6
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,458
Let's see your shoes.

7
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,833
Very well.

8
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,750
Come with me.

9
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,166
Rafiq!

10
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,541
What are you doing here?

11
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,416
All well?

12
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
Is your father with you?

13
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,625
Everything all right?

14
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,125
I left my bag behind.

15
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,125
Men and children, step out and line up.

16
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,708
Go on. Move up.

17
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,541
He is with me. My son.

18
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:25,041
Whatever is happening,
you are not responsible for it.

19
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,250
Then who will take responsibility?

20
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,041
Will you?

21
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,083
Does anyone even listen to you
when you are in uniform?

22
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,000
It's time for prayer.

23
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,000
Get up. Your father will be late for work.
Get some bread.

24
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,291
Come on. Hurry up now.

25
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,666
Leave some money
for vegetables and milk.

26
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,250
What's taking Rafiq so long?

27
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,958
Ghulam Rasool's been here twice.
He was looking for you.

28
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,416
I had to make an excuse.
I said you were unwell.

29
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,916
What's the harm
if he is giving you work?

30
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,541
Let's go, Salima.

31
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,708
Won't you come along?

32
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,958
Is the tea all right?

33
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,333
It needs more salt.

34
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,290
Add some yourself.

35
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,250
Welcome back, sir.

36
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,416
How are things?

37
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,500
How was the journey?

38
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,958
All well at home?

39
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,750
<i>This is Radio Kashmir.</i>

40
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,083
<i>You will now hear the news</i>
<i>from Abdul Hasar.</i>

41
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,625
<i>The union government today announced</i>

42
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,333
<i>the commencement of cellular</i>
<i>phone service in Jammu and Kashmir.</i>

43
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:33,625
<i>Clearances from the Ministries of Home Affairs</i>
<i>and Defense are expected soon.</i>

44
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:39,375
<i>A government spokesman,</i>
<i>addressing the press in Srinagar,</i>

45
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:45,458
<i>said that the SIM cards will be activated</i>
<i>on the day of the Eid festival.</i>

46
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:51,083
<i>Separatist leaders met the foreign secretary</i>
<i>of Pakistan in Delhi today.</i>

47
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:57,875
<i>Earlier they had an extensive discussion</i>
<i>about Kashmir with the US ambassador.</i>

48
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:03,416
<i>A spokesperson for the separatists said</i>
<i>that Indo-Pak talks cannot go ahead...</i>

49
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,416
Matches, please.

50
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,583
<i>...without considering the wishes</i>
<i>of the people of Kashmir.</i>

51
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,875
Here you are, sir.

52
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,625
These shoes are perfect for football.

53
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,041
Sajid! Where's the tea?

54
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,458
In a moment.

55
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,500
He was your recommendation.
Do you realize the trouble it caused?

56
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,708
I had to go house to house
to make deliveries.

57
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,333
I had no idea who read which newspaper.

58
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,916
If I hire a new boy, it'll take him
a month to figure it out.

59
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:01,375
Not reading a newspaper for two days
won't kill anyone.

60
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,458
He'll come tomorrow.

61
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,375
It's not just a matter of two days.

62
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,916
This is about daily delivery.

63
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,500
Don't sweat it.
He will come starting tomorrow.

64
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,666
Come here.

65
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,875
I have given him my word.

66
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,083
You will show up, right?

67
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,583
Let's go. All right, Ghulam Rasool.

68
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,375
Come on. Get up.

69
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,125
Get up and say your prayers.

70
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,333
You will be late for work.

71
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,958
Get up.

72
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:10,375
<i>O world, full of regret</i>

73
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:16,375
<i>No one ever found happiness here</i>

74
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,541
<i>Look who all</i>

75
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:27,500
<i>Have ended up in the grave</i>

76
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,625
<i>O world, full of regret</i>

77
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,750
Why are you wasting your singing talent?

78
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,583
Call the TV show
<i>Who Wants To Be a Superstar?</i>

79
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,583
Will you send me an SMS vote?

80
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:46,666
They are starting a cellular service
in Kashmir.

81
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,708
Kashmiris will vote for you.

82
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:53,333
Kashmiris have never voted in an election.
Why would they vote for me?

83
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,166
Don't worry. I will vote for you.

84
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,041
The SIM cards will be
activated on the day of Eid.

85
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,583
A government sop for us. An Eid gift.

86
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,416
Come on. Sing us a film song.

87
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:12,125
This "World of Regret"
is not going to impress them.

88
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,000
No, man. My throat is parched.

89
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,291
Let's have tea at Sajid's first.

90
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,500
Get up now. Let's go.

91
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,083
Rafiq. Let's go.

92
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,875
Get up, you zombie.

93
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,916
Always sleeping.

94
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,958
He is never going to vote for you, Ishaq.

95
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,041
Ishaq! Ishaq!

96
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,375
Hey! Stop!

97
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,625
Stop!

98
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,458
Wow.

99
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:52,458
He's glowing.

100
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,333
What's up, guys?

101
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,958
I told you to come with me.
I'll show you the life.

102
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,500
-Cool jacket.
-Pants too.

103
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,875
New bike?

104
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:06,000
You will get a bike.

105
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,583
Jacket too. Lots of other stuff.

106
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,125
-Coming?
-Sure!

107
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,208
Let us ride the bike first.

108
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,791
Not now.

109
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:19,208
I'm in a hurry.

110
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,333
But do come and visit me.

111
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,708
Just one ride!

112
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,750
Stop!

113
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,375
Fucking pimp.

114
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,166
Full of dirty money.

115
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,916
Riding his dad's money.

116
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,833
Show-off!

117
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,458
Nice stroke!

118
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,916
What are you doing, my friend?

119
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,208
What are you doing?

120
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,541
Come on, man.

121
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:08,750
Go on.

122
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,500
Can't you see?

123
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,541
Go and get the ball.

124
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,291
Pass the ball.

125
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,958
Hey!

126
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,458
Back off!

127
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,208
Let it go.

128
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,500
Leave it.

129
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,833
Take him home.

130
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,833
Have you lost your mind?
Do you know who he is?

131
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,166
His cousin is a militant commander.

132
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,500
I don't give a shit.

133
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,291
Aslam, go get the ball.

134
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,791
Get it yourself.

135
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,083
My shoes are ripped up in all this mess.

136
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,250
If Kashmir were independent,

137
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,458
we would have been playing
World Cup qualifiers.

138
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,125
We... are here.

139
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,375
We will have to play against India.

140
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,750
Pakistan.

141
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,083
Both of them are busy with cricket.

142
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,333
Afghanistan.

143
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,875
They won't be able to put a team together.

144
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,791
That leaves China.

145
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,500
Our main challenger.

146
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,583
China won't play ball with us.
They'll kick us around like a football.

147
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,666
America won't let that happen.

148
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:15,166
Why would they bother?
We don't even have oil.

149
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,916
But there is going to be a water shortage.
I saw it on Nat Geo.

150
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:24,250
Ten years from now,
a bottle of water will cost 50 bucks.

151
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,708
When did you start
watching these channels?

152
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:30,250
I thought you only watched
countdown shows.

153
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,708
What do you know?

154
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:35,208
America has their own satellites.
They are watching the whole world.

155
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,791
Who knows, they may be tapping
our conversation right now.

156
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,208
What was that?

157
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,416
Rafiq, come here.

158
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,291
Rafiq, let's get out of here!

159
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:07,541
Quiet! What are you doing?

160
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,125
No, Ishaq. Let's go!

161
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,916
Shut up and stay down!

162
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,083
Aslam, stay here.

163
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,541
Rafiq, let's go!

164
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,916
Let's get out of here.

165
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,250
It's not safe here.

166
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:44,791
Rafiq, come on!

167
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,541
Rafiq, let's go.

168
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,041
Come on now. Let's go!

169
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,208
Easy now.

170
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,916
Quietly now.

171
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:27,083
<i>Doctors say that Shamim Ahmed's condition</i>

172

Rafiq.

00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,708
You should get home on time.

<i>and said that the government will ensure</i>

182
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:06,958
<i>that the road work gets completed</i>
<i>as early as possible.</i>

183
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,041
-Come eat dinner.
-I'm not hungry.

184
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,000
<i>It is also said that</i>
<i>by starting the road work,</i>

185
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,291
<i>the local public</i>
<i>will get employment opportunities,</i>

186
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,291
<i>and at the same time</i>
<i>the infrastructure will be improved.</i>

187
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,875
<i>Public announcement:</i>

188
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,958
<i>Please assemble together.</i>

189
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:40,333
<i>This is a request</i>
<i>from security forces</i>

190
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:44,375
<i>to come to the school grounds</i>
<i>for a police lineup.</i>

191
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,666
<i>All males in the neighborhood</i>

192
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:53,875
<i>are requested to assemble</i>
<i>at the school grounds for a police lineup.</i>

193
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,791
Rafiq, clean your room.

194
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,208
I should never have
come back to this hell.

195
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,500
Why are you so mournful?

196
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,125
If you'd have learned to mourn,
you would not be in such agony.

197
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,833
Show me your brother's grave.
I will mourn then.

198
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:26,833
Do you know what it's like
to outlive your child?

199
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,500
If Tauqir had become a militant,
I would have understood.

200
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,541
But he was a nobody!

201
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,916
And how am I at fault?

202
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,916
Don't I at least have the right
to bury my own son?

203
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:41,000
And I won't rest until I know for sure.
If you want to mourn, go ahead.

204
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,916
She lives in our neighborhood.

205
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,625
The army picked her brother up too.

206
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,458
Your mother might know her.

207
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,708
She also goes to APDP meetings.

208
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,750
I'll accompany you tomorrow.

209
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:52,833
To the meeting.

210
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:39,000
-How many "disappeared," according to you?
-8,000 to 10,000.

211
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,250
We want the Indian government
to say where our children are.

212
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,833
We don't want money or jobs.
We want to see our children.

213
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,458
We don't want anything else.

214
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:52,375
If our children are alive,
in prisons, let us meet with them.

215
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:55,875
If they are not alive,
then declare them dead.

216
00:42:55,875 --> 00:43:00,291
The government knows
their security forces have taken them.

217
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,958
The army tells us nothing.

218
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:07,333
Every time there is a case
filed against them,

219
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,958
there is a cover-up.

220
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:02,750
Ramzan.

221
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:19,708
Hey. Move it.

222
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:35,750
Rafiq! Rafiq!

223
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,833
-What happened?
-Rafiq!

224
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,333
Why are you screaming?

225
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,166
Where is Rafiq? Where is he?

226
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:45,958
-Where is this blood from?
-Father. What happened?

227
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:48,750
God have mercy. Mercy!

228
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,458
His hands were trembling with fear.

229
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,958
His eyes were crying out for help.

230
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,666
Asking me to save him somehow.

231
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:34,291
He must've been Rafiq's age.

232
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:38,958
I couldn't do anything.

233
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,000
Nothing.

234
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,916
FREEDOM

235
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,083
Your cap.

236
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,666
Uncle! Four skewers, please.

237
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:37,625
Shame on you. You're going to Delhi now.

238
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,625
Uncle, make that eight.

239
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:40,833
Go sit inside.

240
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,250
All right, Uncle.

241
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:46,041
He's got his stomach hanging out,
like Nazir the Pot.

242
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,208
Nazir who?

243
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,416
When Nazir the Pot became
a government minister, they asked him,

244
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:56,458
"Sir, what would you like to do first,
breakfast, or use the toilet?"

245
00:52:57,166 --> 00:53:00,458
He said, "Bring me a bit of both."

246
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,916
How is he related to you?

247
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:06,500
He isn't yet. Maybe someday
he'll be my brother-in-law.

248
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:27,125
Hey, "World of Regret," eat.

249
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:34,291
No, he is like cotton candy. Those who eat
regret it as much as those who don't.

250
00:53:58,208 --> 00:54:00,583
Rafiq, let's go. Aslam is hurt.

251
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:08,750
Slow... Slow down.
Easy. It will be all right.

252
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,583
Stop! Stop. I'm feeling dizzy.

253
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:17,541
Stop, stop.

254
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:20,125
Yes, Rafiq! Stop him! Stop him!

255
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:28,958
Come on. Come on.
Nothing will happen to you.

256
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:34,208
Hold on. Wait a minute. Get in.

257
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:57,875
Sajid. You'll have to face the Almighty
someday.

258
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:00,333
Why not add some milk
to the tea occasionally?

259
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:04,750
Face the Almighty? We are doing God a favor
by not committing suicide.

260
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm leaving for Jalandhar tomorrow.

261
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,125
One tea.

262
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:18,041
Will you go sell shawls
in 104-degree heat?

263
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,708
That heat is better than
this hell any day.

264
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:29,208
Here's your tea.

265
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,541
Bring it here.

266
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:22,375
Put it here.

267
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:37,583
Want some tea?

268
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,791
So you take pictures?

269
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,583
So what do they need?

270
01:00:56,541 --> 01:00:57,791
Okay.

271
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,916
All right.

272
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:03,416
So how much are they offering?

273
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,958
Then tell them to figure it out
in Delhi itself.

274
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,208
We know what happens in the field.
We face the music out there.

275
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:19,375
Tell them we get $250 per photograph.

276
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:23,458
Yeah.

277
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:28,125
Tell them to talk to us directly then.

278
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,125
Right.

279
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,666
What do you want?

280
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:42,541
Mr. Shamim must have spoken to you,
called you...

281
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:48,333
Mr. Shamim? Yeah, he thinks
this is a government school.

282
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:52,041
Do you know how to make tea?

283
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,416
Charge the battery.

284
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:38,208
Mr. Siraj had asked me
to take the parcel for...

285
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:39,708
Charge the battery first.

286
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:54,250
Cell phones will be very useful
for school and business.

287
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,291
How are you feeling?

288
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,208
Feels great. The mobile phones are here.

289
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,708
But do you think it'll make
a difference in your life?

290
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:12,458
Of course it'll make a difference.

291
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:16,375
Say when we leave home early for work,

292
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:19,833
there could be a blast
or we might get caught in a cross fire.

293
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:21,708
The folks at home won't know.

294
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:27,083
The best thing is we can stay in touch
with our families.

295
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:29,541
And this means safety for everyone.

296
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:35,208
We can go to work without stress.
We can stay in touch with friends and family.

297
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:37,666
We are really happy
that mobile phones are finally here.

298
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,500
I quit.

299
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
Get out of here, you bastard.

300
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:38,666
I was doing you a favor.

301
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:42,958
I can get thousands like you. Nonsense.

302
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:44,875
Useless fellow.

303
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:55,625
I've got a proper job.

304
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,125
Thank God.

305
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:02,166
Did you thank Ghulam Rasool?

306
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:15,166
Has Father had his medicine?

307
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:18,500
We will have to take him elsewhere.

308
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,833
This drug just knocks him out.

309
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:25,833
Salima was saying there are good doctors
at the mental hospital.

310
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,500
We should take him there.

311
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,541
Come on.

312
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:30,000
Rafiq, find out
where you get the forms.

313
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:49,708
Sit down here.

314
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,375
What are you up to? Tea?

315
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:11,708
If this is what you wanted,
you could've worked for Sajid instead.

316
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:16,916
This is rusting too.

317
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,916
-Pick it up. Come with me.
-Where?

318
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,250
-Just pick it up.
-But where?

319
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,125
-Come with me.
-Where?

320
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:26,375
Come on, cotton candy. Take my picture.

321
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,875
This doesn't have film in it.

322
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,875
Not that one! That's Mr. Siraj's.

323
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,166
Nothing will happen. Take it.

324
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:40,958
Tomorrow, when I am a star,
you'll become famous too.

325
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:44,500
-Did you get a reply from the show?
-Yes.

326
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,125
I'm off to Delhi
for north zone qualifiers.

327
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:49,500
Now say,
"Who is going to be a superstar?"

328
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:02,041
What's this back-and-forth?
Just click, man.

329
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:03,083
Go back a little.

330
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,666
Where will I go? You step back.

331
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:09,625
How's my hair?

332
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,250
Are my shoes in frame?

333
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,958
-Hey, what happened? Hold on.
-I'll see you tomorrow.

334
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:27,000
Fucking swine. Do I look like
a tourist photographer to you?

335
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,958
Is this what you've come here to learn?

336
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:24,833
Here. Take this to your lord and master.

337
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,958
Good-for-nothing.

338
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,375
So what is your advice?

339
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,250
Should we wait for a better offer?

340
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,458
I was hoping we will be done
during this trip.

341
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,500
We can't possibly keep coming back.

342
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:10,333
Did you speak to Mr. Hafiz?

343
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:13,125
He's not willing to go above 2.8 million.

344
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:16,166
He knows it is a distress sale.

345
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:28,208
Mr. Kaul, this is Arundhati,
a TV journalist from Delhi.

346
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:32,000
Mr. Kaul is my mentor.

347
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,041
His son Rajesh.

348
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,791
He has come from Delhi
to sell their ancestral house.

349
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:44,416
I am today content with my struggle
outside Kashmir.

350
01:13:44,416 --> 01:13:47,125
Because I don't fear for my life everyday.

351
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,125
What about you, Rafiq?

352
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,166
Do you know any Kashmiri Pandit?

353
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:05,958
What have you got there?

354
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,875
Mr. Siraj sent this for you.

355
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:29,458
Aren't you buying a cell phone?

356
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:33,083
You qualify for the show first.

357
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:35,875
If I don't qualify, I won't come back.

358
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,541
Let's take a picture of you.

359
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:42,000
Wait a minute.

360
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,125
Let me strike a pose first.

361
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:50,125
Now what?

362
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,208
Give Father his medicine.

363
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:04,541
Father.

364
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:11,916
Where is he?

365
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,125
Check in the storeroom.

366
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:38,166
Father, your medicine.

367
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,458
All set for the Eid festival?

368
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:20,166
Performing the sacrifice?

369
01:24:36,958 --> 01:24:38,583
This is from your bag.

370
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,583
I'll return your money.

371
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:15,541
No problem.

372
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,958
-Who is in there?
-He's a friend.

373
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:34,500
-At this hour?
-Don't worry. Go back to sleep.

374
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:47,333
-Rafiq's friend.
-So late?

375
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:50,000
It's all right. Go back to sleep.

376
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,458
Sleep now.

377
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:08,333
You've taken these pictures?

378
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,208
That's Shaheen.

379
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:48,250
Ever since my first militant action,
I can't sleep at night.

380
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:56,583
Every night before going to sleep,
I try hard to dream about my mother.

381
01:26:57,166 --> 01:26:59,291
But I only ever see scary faces.

382
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,541
I'm sure your mother
dreams of you all the time.

383
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:18,791
One thing is certain.

384
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,541
The path to paradise
does not go via Pakistan.

385
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:51,125
How is Pervez?

386
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:53,708
Hey. Hands up!

387
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,750
Can't you hear?
Hands up, I say!

388
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:18,375
I need your help.

389
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,791
I can't go home.

390
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:24,875
Give this to my mother.

391
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:32,541
Rafiq, your father has wandered out
somewhere. Go look for him!

392
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:56,250
Oh, my Lord!

393
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:31,333
Oh, my Rafiq!

394
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:35,250
Alas, my Rafiq!
