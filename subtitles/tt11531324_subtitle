My heart overwhelms with joy!

33
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:14,542
Our lives set example...

34
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:19,292
...for the existence of nature!

35
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,792
In this materialistic world...

36
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:28,792
...we give hope for existence!

37
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:56,583

year, I wont spare him.

56
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,583
Careful bro, you know what

Hey, bill this...

89
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,417
Hello... this is the queue!

Get the bill...

91
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,833
- What's your problem?
- Sir, please ignore this.

92
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,833
- Please ignore her sir,
- Be careful, don't provoke me.

93
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,292
Why are you creating a fuss?

94
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,292
- Is he right?
- No, but still did anyone opposed?

95
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,000
- Is it wrong to ask?
- You can ask..pick fight..and you know what happens then?

96
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,083
What happens?

97
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:21,667
He will come with more
thugs, that's what happens.

98
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:29,250
No one risks their life for
the extra 30 seconds in queue!

99
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,500
Do you know the story of the Lion?

100
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,167
A Lion, in the forest lives
by hunting its prey...

101
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:15,625
One day, A dog was standing far and
looking at Lion feasting on a prey!

102
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
...once the Lion finishes the
food, the dog ate the remains...

103
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,708
The Lion sees this
but ignores the dog!

104
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:33,167
Then everyday, the Dog survived
with the remains of Lion's food

105
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,333
One day, the Dog got an idea.

106
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:41,750
The Lion is not attacking,
so why to eat the remain?

107
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,917
With that thought,
it decides to feast along with Lion!

108
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:50,208
So the dog, is now close to the Lion.

109
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:58,000
The Lion got pissed and thrashed the
dog with little life left behind.

110
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,333
The bitten dog, decides to avenge Lion...

111
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,708
So it formed a team of dogs
and waited to strike the Lion!

112
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:12,958
They tried to overcome
Lion but were defeated!

113
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,833
Do you know why?

114
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,792
Because, it's just a dog!

115
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,667
Idly again! Please mom!

116
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,042
Bread and Jam, Please!

117
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,083

118
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:06,500

119
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,792

120
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,458

00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,292

126
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,917
There's no water, go and check!

127
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,750
Dear, this is plumbing! I'm pipe Engineer!

128
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,708

off the valve, will check now.

129
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,083
Yeah, Please ask him! Half the time, the water is not there...

130
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,042
...the lift will not work...

131
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,000
...that's why tenants are leaving...

132
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,625
...and on top, there's spillage!

133
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,833
I need to keep checking all this!

134
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,750
This is a commercial building...

135
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,458
and due to no sales, it became a
residential property, what can I do?

136
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:04,625
Let's do one thing, let me get a
job and you do the house works!

137
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,500
Wow, My wife is beautiful even in anger!

00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,917

bank, that's why they took him away.

177
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,042
That's civil case and still
no one can manhandle him!

178
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,083
Son...

179
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,542
Do one thing, you teach them how to handle it

180
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,083
I got other works to do

181
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,542
- Swaminathan sir, Just listen to me...
- Get lost, don't waste my time.

182
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,333
Insane guy!

183
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,125
Marudhu didn't know that we
provoked Selva to attack him,

184
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,917
Selva was murdered before exposing us,

185
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:52,958
So we should be on alert
and take down Marudhu first.

186
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:59,042
Even a slightest slip will lead to our deaths!

187
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,458
Hey, Stop there.

188
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,042
Brother,
lots of pending work in pipeline.

189
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,500
There is some problem inside, so don't go in.

190
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:50,750
- If I leave, I can only fix it next month...
- Leave now, Marudhu is here...

191
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:54,292
I have no involvement in
Selva's attack on you.

192
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:57,458
Also, I wouldn't use him to kill
you, I would've done it myself.

193
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,042
Marudhu?

194
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,792
Brother, don't do this.

195
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:15,792
I plead you, better leave the place!

196
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,250
Leave... Please leave.

197
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,958
Mom, Lolli-pop!

198
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,292
Let's go.

199
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,375
Come, I will buy one.

200
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,208
Thank you.

201
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,333
Third floor.

202
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,458
Arjun... Say Thanks.

203
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,583
- Thanks Grandpa.
- That's ok.

204
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,250
Aadhi...

205
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,125
Aadhi...

206
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,792
Aadhi...

207
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,958
Aadhi...

208
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,750
Why so long?

209
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,667
What were you doing?

210
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:37,292
Why are you looking so dull?

211
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,375
Are you faking it?

212
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:46,333
I will not fall for you acting,
it's your turn to get the house clean today.

213
00:29:57,125 --> 00:30:01,083
Dear... Karuna...

214
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:05,833
...Don't know what happened and
doctors are not giving clear picture.

215
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,250
Karuna...

216
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,167
Karuna...

217
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,083
Madam, Haven't you left yet?

218
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:27,792
I told you that your son will not
survive, take him to Government hospital.

219
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:32,375
He's my only son and we
have waited long enough!

220
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Do you know that?

221
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:41,000
Sir, He's new here and
he don't know about you.

222
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,500
You son's heart is not functioning proper...

223
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,125
...he easily gets tired,
he's not active like other kids...

224
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:57,167
...and all because of his
ailing heart condition.

225
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,583
It's too late for any medications.

226
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,083
The only solution is heart transplant.

227
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:11,667
But, you know that he
got rare blood group...

228
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,667
It's hard to get a donor at same age group.

229
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,750
Even if we find one, waiting list is long.

230
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:25,000
So... Sorry Sir...

231
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:47,917
Sir.

232
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:56,458
If a donor of same blood
group and right age...

233
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,875
...met with accident and hospitalised...

234
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:04,875
...and declared brain dead,...

235
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,167
then that donor can save your son.

236
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:22,042
Karuna...

237
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:27,792
Bro...

238
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:31,417
Yes bro...

239
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:36,875
Guna, I don't care how many you will
kill, but I want my son to live.

240
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,042
Ok bro, Sure.

241
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:43,917
I will take care.

242
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:08,208
Your magical smile does wonders in my life!

243
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:16,542
You added colours in our
life with your presence!

244
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:25,208
You are the serene tune of my life!

245
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:33,750
You inspire us to love the universe!

246
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:42,375
You are my solace and you are my dreams!

247
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:05,917
Every word you utter,
sprinkles like raindrops!

248
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:13,708
Every sound you make are
the boons of the day!

249
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:22,833
The depth of our life depends on your smile!

250
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:31,833
And I thank almighty for your presence!

251
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:40,625
I will protect you till my last breath!

252
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:49,000
I will keep you in my heart till it beats!

253
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:53,500
Life is a puzzle...

254
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:57,333
Living is the solution!

255
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,375
Our life depends on you my son!

256
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,708
- So, everything going good?
- Yes Sir!

257
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,792
Then why don't you sell
this and buy a new house?

258
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:42,792
Sir, this house is my lucky charm.
Arjun was born here...

259
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:46,833
...also we got used to this lovely
neighbourhood, so we will not move away.

260
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:50,500
You will never listen to me!

261
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:51,625
Thank you sir!

262
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,875
- Ok Bye,
- Bye Sir.

263
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,250
- Hello
- Sir, This is Bala.

264
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,125
- Bala?
- Sir, you came for your son's blood test.

265
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,625
Yeah, but doctor's cleared
that there is no issue.

266
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,875
Sir, it's not about that...

267
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:20,292
...Marudhu's men came and
took your son's report.

268
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,500
Marudhu's Men? But why?

269
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:25,125
I heard Madrudhu's son is in hospital...

270
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:28,792
...he got a heart condition,
his son is of same age like Arjun...

271
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:32,000
...so you better leave with your
son, just leave sir.

272
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:59,208
Do you know where
this kid lives?

273
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,583
Do you know?

274
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,333
Who are you?

275
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,792
Do you know where this kid lives?

276
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,833
Why are you guys are here? Please leave.

277
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:21,667
It's midnight, please leave guys.

278
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,083
Sir, you please leave.

279
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,542
Who will know about this kid?

280
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,667
Come, come with us.

281
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,708
Hey old man...

282
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Do you know flat
number of this kid?

283
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,500
Do you know or not?

284
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,750
Why you look so confused?

285
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,458
Do you know?

286
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,833
I think 4D

287
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:27,417
4D right? Get the Lift.

288
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:55,000
PLEASE CLOSE THE DOORS OF THE LIFT

289
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,333
What?

290
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,167
Let's take stairs.

291
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,083
Close the lift doors.

292
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,208
Move away.

293
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:49,833
Arjun... Arjun, let's go.

294
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,917
- Come fast, let's go.
- Dad, my doll!

295
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,708
Mithra... Mithra...

296
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,458
Mithra...

297
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:00,917
Dad, my doll!

298
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:05,417
Mithra... Mithra... come, let's go.

299
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,167
- But where?
- I will let you know.

300
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:12,500
What... tell me...

301
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,792
Where are we rushing at this hour?

302
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,708
What happened?

303
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,208
Just a minute.

304
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,458
Hey... check it out.

305
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,125
- This house bro.
- Is it?

306
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,625
Is this your son?

307
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:26,292
No, This is Adhiyaman's son.

308
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:31,458
His name is Arjun, 10F, tenth floor.

309
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,792
Oh, are you sure?

310
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:34,792
Confirm!

311
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:38,625
Carry on.

312
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,125
Vasu... Vasu...

313
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,458
Why are you knocking?

314
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,500
Vasu...

315
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,292
I'm scared Aadhi.

316
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,208
- Vasu...
- What happened?

317
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:34,250
Open the door.

318
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,792
- Hey, what's up bro?
- Mithra, get in.

319
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:56,917
- What happened?
- Shhhh, Please keep quiet.

320
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:47,042
Hey, Break it.

321
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,167
Who is it?

322
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,292
Hey, Who are these guys?

323
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:18,000
Who are these guys?
Why are they breaking in?

324
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,333
Tell me...

325
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,167
Vasu, Get Arjun inside.

326
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:42,792
- What's happening?
- No idea, take him inside.

327
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:47,750
Why are they searching for you? Explain...

328
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:51,375
They are not searching me,
They are here for Arjun.

329
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,542
Let me inform Police.

330
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,000
They showed Arjun's picture
and asked me whether I know him

331
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:43,042
They all came up, I don't know what to do.

332
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,917
So brought you to Vasu house.

333
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:50,542
I will take care of our son.

334
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:58,708
I will not let anyone to harm Arjun.

335
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:01,000
Hello, Police station.

336
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:05,917
Just give a minute.

337
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:16,625
- Arjun
- Dad

338
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,208
Arjun...

339
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:48,792
The other day, we raced towards the
lift to press the button, remember?

340
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:52,458
Shall we try the same today? Ready?

341
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:00,208
I informed Police, they are on the way.

342
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,917
These guys will definitely
knock your door asking about me.

343
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:06,000
So, If I leave the apartment,
no one will be harmed.

344
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,417
Mithra, let's go.

345
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:10,083
Listen to me...

346
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,333
DAD!

347
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,875
- I want to leave now
- Go...

348
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,167
- I'm talking to you son.
- What the hell you want?

349
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:24,667
- Who are you? Why are you here?
- Get lost old man!

350
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:28,833
Idiots!

351
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:30,667
Bro said he will be here soon.

352
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,625
Hey old man, You haven't gone yet?

Hello, why are you barging in?

357
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,583
Who allowed you inside?

358
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:13,042

359
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:15,667

00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:41,000
Being a lawyer, I couldn't save myself...

Mithra, nothing will happen.
Please calm down.

394
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:23,042
Hey, just open the damn door.

395
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,292
Idiot.

396
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:38,667
What took you so long to open the door?

397
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:53,833
Where is you kid?

398
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,083
Where is he?

399
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,042
No one came inside bro.

400
00:53:58,208 --> 00:54:01,208
Do I look like an idiot? Get lost.

401
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,625

461
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,708
- Let's stay till police arrives.
- No Mithra, let's go to rooftop.

462
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,375

Mithra, until I call you,
don't come out of rooftop.

470
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:57,250
Mithra, take Arjun with you.

471
01:11:57,958 --> 01:11:59,833
Take Arjun with
you, I will manage.

472
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,583

Dad, I'm scared, you are lying.
I saw a guy hitting mom.

506
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:32,292
She will be fine, I will bring her.
Please trust me.

507
01:22:32,292 --> 01:22:34,500
Dad, I'm scared. You are lying.

- Don't get scared. Please understand.

01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,250
Won't you say?

521
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,042
Bro, He's Adhiyaman.

522
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:11,917
Where is your son?

Do you know why I'm searching for your son?

So, you know.

525
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,417
I waited for a child for 13 years!

526
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:33,417
I have no other way.

527
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:36,458
We can't decide anyone's death.

528
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:42,625
You want to kill my son right...

529
01:25:43,542 --> 01:25:44,500
...I won't say.

530
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:50,375
True, we can't decide anyone's death.

531
01:25:51,042 --> 01:25:53,917
But there's a different between us...

532
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:58,250
Have you seen Lion hunting a deer?

533
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,958
You will find it in Discovery channel.

534
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:05,750
Only if the Lion hunts,
the cubs will survive

535
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,000
Else, they will die...

536
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:10,750
...so for survival, it has to hunt!

537
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:16,333
Also, The deer needs to
run for it's survival...

538
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:19,292
There is no other option
for either Deer or Lion.

539
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:26,500
So here, The winner will be decided by
either Lion's hunger or Deer's fear.

540
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:36,333
Mom...

541
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:23,292
There is no use in delaying
death, Where is your kid?

542
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,917
Yeah... is it... bring him.

543
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,292
Bro, we got the kid.

544
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,375
Careful, with the knife!

545
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,083
Come on, stab me!

546
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,333
Come... come...

547
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:09,750
Do... Do it...

548
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,458
...and then take your son.

549
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,708
Come... come...

550
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:45,417
Leave me... Dad...

551
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:49,250
Arjun...

552
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:52,958
Leave me... Dad...

553
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:56,625
Leave me...

554
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:14,542
Don't you know that you are outnumbered?
Do you think you can still save your son?

555
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:20,042
I don't know how many of you are here...

556
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,958
...but you are in my place now.

557
01:30:19,792 --> 01:30:24,583
Sir, need to fill diesel for generator
and you have the store room key.

558
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:37,667
Vase, I have no clue about
Mithra and Arjun's whereabouts.

559
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:43,000
I filled the fire safety
wall pipe with diesel,

560
01:30:43,208 --> 01:30:48,875
A small spark is enough to trigger fire
safety valve and diesel will spill across

561
01:30:48,917 --> 01:30:50,333
...and the whole
house will be on fire.

562
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:53,167
Idiot, you will also burn down!

563
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:57,333
I don't have any other choice, whatever
happens, you don't leave your house.

564
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:06,125
Bro, got the kid.

565
01:31:16,167 --> 01:31:17,417
Careful... with the knife.

566
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:28,583
Come... kill me and take your son.

567
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:54,125
Don't you know that you are outnumbered?
Do you think you can still save your son?

568
01:31:59,292 --> 01:32:01,875
I don't know how many of you are here...

569
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:07,208
...but you are in my place now.

570
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:52,208
No issues bro, all the videos has
been sent to police commissioner.

571
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:54,708
And we cleared everything as you said...

572
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:58,125
No one gets a doubt, all are safe.

573
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:09,083
Sir... Sir...

574
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,250
Get him.

575
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:14,250
I will kill you all if you raise voice.

576
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:17,042
Sir, just listen to us. Please.

577
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:20,250
Sir, Please, give us a minute... please...

578
01:33:22,167 --> 01:33:24,542
We should do something...

579
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,458
Tell me...

580
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,792
How did you kill them?

581
01:33:58,042 --> 01:33:59,667
Make him sit.

582
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:06,458
How did you kill Marudhu?

583
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,250
How did you kill Marudhu?

584
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:12,417
Don't kill him sir, calm down.

585
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:15,292
Please leave him sir, come.

586
01:34:18,667 --> 01:34:20,458
Let's go sir.

587
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,250
He will die if you hit him hard.

588
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:28,667
Let him die...

589
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:31,125
Marudhu was my uncle.

590
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:34,208
He got me this job, do you know?

591
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,958
I haven’t seen my sister cry,
do you want me to spare him?

592
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:42,000
Who asked you to spare him sir?

593
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:44,917
Your cousin is still alive right?

594
01:34:46,417 --> 01:34:51,417
Your revenge should be
painful till his death!

595
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:55,583
I'm in station sir, yes... he's here only.

01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:58,250

Just an inquiry sir.

I know what you are unto.

600
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:08,083

Let's go... slowly

607
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:49,500
Don't assume that you have fixed
everything... real problem starts now.

608
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:52,125
Go...

609
01:36:10,375 --> 01:36:15,250
Don't assume that you have fixed
everything... real problem starts now.

610
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:34,833

- Mithra, Are you safe?

612
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:54,542
- I'm fine, but Arjun keeps asking about you.
- Who is it? Daddy?

613
01:36:57,708 --> 01:37:00,458
No issues right?

614
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:05,792
Hello... Mithra.

615
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:17,750
Just do as I say, Keep the
cylinder near the door and block it.

616
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:21,250
Don't worry, Everything should be fine.

617
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:28,333
Hey, Stop there.

618
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,458

Anything else?

633
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:58,917
The innocent deer, kept praying to God...

634
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:02,875
...to save from death!

635
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:15,042
The roaring lion approaches...

636
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:19,708
the deer takes off...

637
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:32,250
With belief, Deer runs fast!

01:40:36,792 --> 01:40:42,250
