1
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,392
lt's a clear case of suicide..

2
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,403
..due to a failed marriage
and an on-going..

3
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:13,505
..legal battle for the custody
of his children..

4
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:16,267
..had completely shattered
Mr. Shubroto.

5
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:18,775
According to the police
this can be an accident.

6
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:20,271
Mr. Shubroto was quite worried..

7
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,780
..the night when this
incident occurred.

8
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,748
lt's also being said that he was..

9
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,478
..also under the
influence of alcohol.

10
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:27,553
Shubroto Mukherjee liked fishing..

11
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,813
..and he'd often spend
his weekend fishing.

12
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,757
The viscera tests have proved
that Shubroto was drunk..

13
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,760
..and maybe he drowned because
of his drunken state.

14
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,626
Shurboto was an ideal
for his colleagues..

15
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:38,857
..and fellow reporters.

16
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,763
He'll always be missed for his..

17
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,200
..pure reporting and his courage
to expose the truth.

18
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,864
The entire staff & management
of Crime 24..

19
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:49,272
..is in deep shock after losing
their star reporter.

20
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:50,775
Shubroto's family,
especially his wife..

21
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:52,277
..have not spoken to the media.

22
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,380
ln this sad times..

23
00:03:58,752 --> 00:03:59,741
Sorry!

24
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,217
Shubroto's death is a deep shock..

25
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:05,850
..for every employee of Crime 24.

26
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,124
Because Shuboto
was our inspiration.

27
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,126
He was our ideal.

28
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:11,760
Our strength.

29
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,359
We're sad, but we're also proud..

30
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,264
Mind blowing! Check out.

31
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,895
l met Shubroto in Bangalore,
in a media seminar.

32
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:24,343
Hello.
- Hello.

33
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:25,503
Did you talk to him?

34
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:26,907
All you get is 20 minutes.

35
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:28,314
20 minutes is enough.

36
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:29,678
l'll wrap up everything by then.

37
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:31,681
Do you know Lucky
Hotel in Safdarjung?

38
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,681
l'll find it, no problem.

39
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:36,187
One more thing. He demands 15,000.

40
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,779
15?

41
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:40,385
You said 10. And now 15.

42
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,394
lts' 15 now. Can you arrange it?

43
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,862
Does anyone have Rs.5000 right now?
- Right now?

44
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,834
Why do you need Rs.5000 suddenly?

45
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:52,133
To increase my career graph
and create a sensation.

46
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,767
l don't have. - lf that's the case
then who can refuse.

47
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:56,739
Here you go.
- Thank you.

48
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:59,174
Now no one can stop me
from becoming a media star.

49
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:00,177
Thank you.

50
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:06,683
Thank you so much forjoining..

51
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,448
..and l shall see
you all in a minute.

52
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:09,544
Thank you.

53
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,160
l've arranged for Rs.5000.

54
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,698
5000 is no good.

55
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,889
lt's worthless.

56
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:27,739
l'll arrange for the rest tomorrow.

57
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,900
Then l suggest we schedule
the interview for tomorrow.

58
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,504
Okay, just hold on.

59
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,641
Yeah, sweetheart.
- Where are you, Sam?

60
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,113
On the flyover, why?

61
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:37,908
Sam, what're you
doing on a flyover?

62
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:39,342
There's always
a flyover on the way.

63
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,217
Forget that, Sam, are you coming?
- Where?

64
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,257
Sam, the opening?
- Opening?

65
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,423
Sam, the opening
of my new paintings.

66
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,387
Ahana, is that today?

67
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:53,197
Sam, what's wrong with you?

68
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,857
l've been planning this evening
for the past two weeks.

69
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,765
l discussed every little detail
with you.

70
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:58,671
Ahana, oh..

71
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,171
l thought the opening's tomorrow.
l swear.

72
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,262
Just forget all that.

73
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,400
Just leave everything
you're doing and come here.

74
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:05,133
l can't come now. l'm going for
something important.

75
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,735
l've been waiting for the news for
a long time.

76
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:09,111
And finally l got it today.
l've to be there in 20 minutes.

77
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:10,444
lt's an amazing story,
you will love it.

78
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,610
Sam, it's the same excuse again.

79
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:13,675
Amazing story.

80
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,220
Your plan, your career.

81
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:16,312
l'm just a commercial break, right.

82
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,219
Ahana, can l call you back?

83
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:19,547
No need.

84
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,271
Fine, keep this Titan as well.

85
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,248
No need to check.
lt shows the right time.

86
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,589
l always count the notes
and choose my wench.

87
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,161
Mike.
- What?

88
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,372
lt's a mike, to catch your voice.

89
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:09,164
l see.

90
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,507
No one should recognise it.

91
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:13,443
Not the police or anyone else.

92
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,345
lf anyone does,
that's the end of my business..

93
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:17,846
..and your life. Get it.

94
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,712
Don't worry,
we won't show your face.

95
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:22,752
Ready?

96
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,848
What do you do?

97
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,520
l sell phenyl.

98
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,783
No, actually.
- Actually!

99
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,585
l'm a shooter.

100
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,357
That means you kill people.

101
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:34,866
l hate blowing my own trumpet.

102
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:36,658
How many people have you killed?

103
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,633
Never thought anyone would ask
this question?

104
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:39,694
But..

105
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,207
14!
- 14.

106
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:43,866
Haven't been too long in
this business.

107
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,709
Don't you feel guilty while or
after killing someone?

108
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,209
Yes. l do.

109
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,317
Everyone has some kind of guilt..

110
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:53,477
..but what can l do?

111
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,612
And you kill men and women..
- Not women.

112
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,689
No women and children.
That's my rule.

113
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:00,786
And.. how do you feel
after killing someone?

114
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:02,719
Fantastic! Superb!

115
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,189
What do you say to him before
you kill him?

116
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,328
Now there's a variety in that.

117
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,591
Different people.

118
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:11,502
Some die of a heart-attack
when they see a gun.

119
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:12,863
Before l can kill him.

120
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,664
Some start crying
when they see a gun.

121
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:16,537
They beg for mercy.

122
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,667
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

123
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,678
l'll pay you double but spare me,
please.

124
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,509
lt's really fun
to kill people like that.

125
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,248
The finger automatically
squeezes the trigger.

126
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:25,180
Bang!

127
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:28,683
And there are some
who just become silent.

128
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,346
Their eyes seem empty.

129
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,385
They look at you as if they're
staring at nothingness.

130
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,562
lt's slightly difficult
to kill people like that.

131
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,560
Have you ever killed
any important person?

132
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:40,755
Any VlP?

133
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,095
Yes, l did.

134
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:45,430
Why, are they any special?
-No.

135
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,138
l just want to know.

136
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:48,731
Yes, l did.

137
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,241
That..

138
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,604
V.M Shukla.

139
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:56,180
But it was no fun.

140
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:57,249
He died instantly.

141
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,306
V.M Shukla?

142
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,380
You killed industrialist
V.M Shukla.

143
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:01,850
Yes. That's what l just said.

144
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:04,248
On whose orders?
Can you tell us his name?

145
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:09,258
ls this an interview
or an investigation?

146
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,790
Ask silly questions and
l'll shoot you.

147
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,633
Bullet in, brains out.

148
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:15,827
You know, don't you?
- l do.

149
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:21,239
Have you ever killed anyone?

150
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:23,664
Yes, l did.

151
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,677
Few cockroaches, some rats.

152
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,579
But no humans.

153
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,413
No one wants to do this.

154
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,175
lt's the situation that
that renders you helpless.

155
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,412
..and then you don't think.

156
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:36,521
You just kill. To save yourself.

157
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:42,689
Take a good look.

158
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,459
l am your shadow.

159
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:50,599
Those who slay demons
turns into one.

160
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:16,827
Yes, l did.

161
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:18,488
Killed V.M Shukla.

162
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,723
Hold it! Hold it! Pause that.

163
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,767
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:25,133
Sam, if.. that's true..
- lt's absolutely true.

165
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:26,527
Then the game's over.

166
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:30,607
Like l said one day l..
- And he knew one day he'll die.

167
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:32,404
You know something guys.

168
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,740
V.M Shukla was behind the Sona
and Chattarpur land scam..

169
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,544
..and that's why the police
won't like your story.

170
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:40,778
But that's what we want.

171
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,517
That's how it becomes a story.

172
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,615
Make it into a two-part
special programme.

173
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,361
The headlines will be
The murderer will speak..

174
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:54,255
..on television today.
He'll unveil the secrets.

175
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:57,300
l think a Shooter's shocking
truth sounds better.

176
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:58,831
What do you think, guys?
- l think that's better.

177
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,304
Yeah.
- l think that's good.

178
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,741
Upload your video on the website.

179
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:04,469
lnform all the sponsors.

180
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:08,804
And l want the promo of this
program by 3 o'clock on air.

181
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,876
So, go, go, go!
This is a news channel, man.

182
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:11,606
Yes, boss.
- Come on.

183
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,151
This is not an old age home.

184
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:14,878
We don't get such
story's everyday..

185
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,554
..and we don't want
to waste Sam's efforts.

186
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,825
Have you ever seen
the face of death?

187
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,461
A face that you turn you frozen.

188
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,369
Death, where all questions come
to an end..

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,533
..have you ever questioned
him face to face.

190
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:37,473
Maybe not.

191
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:38,475
And even if anybody did..

192
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,273
..didn't live to tell the answers.

193
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,644
But l saw death and
even asked question.

194
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,910
And l'm alive to
show you the answers.

195
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,345
You can run into death anywhere..

196
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,356
..like the bus, train,
cinema halls, malls.

197
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:53,682
Because even though he's
dreadful from inside..

198
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,488
..but he looks normal just
like you and me.

199
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:58,689
But yet he's different.

200
00:11:58,798 --> 00:11:59,890
He has no pity or emotion.

201
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,228
No soul, no mercy.

202
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,801
He's completely inhumane.

203
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,494
Due to our professional ethics..

204
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,538
..we cannot reveal his face to you.

205
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,837
But what we're going to show
next will shock you.

206
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,575
What do you?
- l am a shooter.

207
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,510
How many people have you
killed until now?

208
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:15,580
Never thought anyone would ask
this question?

209
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:16,637
But..

210
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,748
14!

211
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,251
Haven't been too long in
this business.

212
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,310
And you kill men and women..
- Not women.

213
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,251
No women and children.
That's my rule.

214
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:28,120
Some die of a heart-attack
when they see a gun.

215
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:54,512
What did he say his name was?

216
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:56,814
He didn't say his name.

217
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:03,720
You're lying, aren't you?

218
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,198
lf l say l'm telling the truth
will you believe me?

219
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,324
We can see from your eyes
that you're lying.

220
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,203
Tell us his name, his address.

221
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:12,832
And also his phone number.

222
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:15,165
Look, he didn't tell me his name.

223
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,638
No number or address either.

224
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,776
And the person who gave me
his contact..

225
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,573
..called me from different
landline numbers.

226
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:22,841
Do you know that you're..

227
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:25,907
..creating problems in the
on-going murder investigation..

228
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,218
..of V.M Shukla case?

229
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:30,744
Creating problems?

230
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,158
ln an investigation that
hasn't even begun.

231
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:35,551
You know a lot about this case,
don't you?

232
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,887
ls that why you're helping
the murderer?

233
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,625
Look, sir. l'm only doing the
duty of a journalist.

234
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,927
Whoever falls in the clutches
of the Special Cell..

235
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:45,264
..really regrets it.

236
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,867
Do you want me to show you?

237
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:50,636
What are you staring it?

238
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:55,211
l'll blow your brains out,
get that!

239
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,546
Firstly the law
fails to punish them..

240
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,147
..and then people like
you make them heroes.

241
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:02,178
That's theirjob!

242
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,150
Proving wenches are divine.

243
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:05,651
lt's all a joke for them!

244
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:26,868
Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,803
Samar speaking.
From the news channel.

246
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:30,346
The one who gave you the watch.

247
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,646
Yes, it's showing the right time.

248
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:33,841
Anyway.

249
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,744
Tell him that he
can run into trouble.

250
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:37,189
What nonsense?

251
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:38,382
The police can create a problem.

252
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:39,713
Just keep your lid closed..

253
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,383
..l'll handle the rest.
- Okay.

254
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:52,826
Yes, Mr. Gupta.

255
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:20,754
Nice court.

256
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,364
The court next
to it is much better.

257
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,764
The wood here has caught moisture.

258
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,272
Sir, l can feel the softness
in your voice.

259
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,303
Any problem?

260
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:37,741
Sam, what's the definition of
a news channel according to you?

261
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:40,246
The news channel is a medium that..

262
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:43,584
..makes the people aware of the
truth on all the issues.

263
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:46,590
The News Channel is
a corporation, Sam..

264
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,590
..and one needs a lot
of money to run it.

265
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:50,853
License fee.

266
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,522
Satellite space.

267
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,131
Travelling expense.

268
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,666
Buying Equipment's.

269
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,235
Paying your salary.

270
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,861
Paying my club membership.

271
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,599
Everything.
And there's lot more, Sam.

272
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,470
And like the rest
there is one man..

273
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,477
..in this corporation
who arranges for the money.

274
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,112
Draws advertisers.
Helps build products.

275
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:10,504
l know. Gupta.

276
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,446
But why tell me all this, sir?

277
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,344
V.M Shukla was
Mr. Gupta's childhood friend.

278
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,751
Do you get that into your head?

279
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:20,781
Oh no!

280
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:22,888
Yes! Exactly!

281
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:25,825
Sir, l didn't know.

282
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:26,887
l didn't either.

283
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:30,428
But, sir,
my story was based on truth..

284
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:32,164
..and not only for
creating sensation.

285
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:33,802
And you always said that
a news channel..

286
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,568
..shouldn'tjust think about
their investors..

287
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,732
..but also about their audience,
and the truth.

288
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,175
You said it yourself.
- Yeah, l said it.

289
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,234
l must have said it sometime.

290
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:41,402
So big deal.

291
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:43,506
l might've said it.

292
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:47,785
Sam, this time it's personal.

293
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:50,853
People are calling from Fiji!

294
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,148
From the Chamber of Commerce.

295
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,886
His industrialist friends
are very angry..

296
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:57,152
..because this bloody
story was telecasted!

297
00:16:58,364 --> 00:16:59,888
And you don't want to
know about Delhi police.

298
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,066
Yeah, they came to my office
without an appointment.

299
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:04,231
People respect V.M Shukla, Sam.

300
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:10,671
That means you're firing me
from the job.

301
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,301
You're firing me.

302
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:16,706
Just.. just forget me.

303
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:20,380
Sam. Try to understand.
- l've better things to do.

304
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,347
Sam, l owe you one!

305
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,079
Damn it!

306
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,180
Bloody hell!

307
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:27,449
What did Mehra say?

308
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:28,457
What else?
- What are you doing?

309
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,324
He just withdraw from
the entire matter.

310
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,091
He's become Mr. Clean.
- But it's not your fault.

311
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:34,564
lt has to me someone's fault.

312
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,827
Where will you go, Samar?

313
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,370
l don't know. Maybe to some bar,
and drown my sorrows.

314
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,563
Sam, he means..
- l know, l know.

315
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:43,597
l have some offers.

316
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,902
l will think them after having
couple of drinks.

317
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,134
Are you sure?
- You do.

318
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,912
When you've a knack on taking
the dirt road..

319
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,178
..always keep a spare tyre.

320
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:53,875
For safety.
- l don't understand.

321
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:00,586
Friends, keep fighting.

322
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,627
Against lies, injustice.

323
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:05,058
Go insane sometimes, like me.

324
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,628
Actually, don't. Otherwise you'll
have to pack up like me.

325
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:23,247
We completely regret and admit..

326
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:25,078
..that one of our senior reporter..

327
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:29,620
..used a lowly and cheap way
to get famous.

328
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:33,785
And made a shooter's story,
and a fake one.

329
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,824
l would like to request
our audience, the common people..

330
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:39,421
..and especially the Delhi Police..

331
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,462
..that there's no sharp-shooter
or hit man.

332
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,533
lt was just the imagination
of Samar Grover's mind.

333
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:50,503
For making up an fictitious story..

334
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,836
..and humiliating
our channel we've..

335
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:58,182
..fired Samar Grover
from this channel.

336
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,190
So, you're giving
me an opportunity..

337
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:13,856
..to spend an evening with you.

338
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:16,063
Can l know what's so special today?

339
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,670
Ahana, you taunt me for everything.

340
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:30,471
l've left Pulse.

341
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,739
What?

342
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:34,683
Yes..
- Left!

343
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,381
Because l hurt Mr. Gupta.

344
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:41,452
The shooter l interviewed..

345
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,289
..had murdered
Gupta's friend Shukla.

346
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,322
And by the way, Ashok Mehra..

347
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:47,126
..gave a green
signal to this story.

348
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,322
He was so enthusiastic.

349
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,129
Do this, do that..
make a cool promo!

350
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:51,425
Samar's efforts..

351
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,227
Oh no!

352
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,236
As soon as he saw that things
are getting worse..

353
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,439
..he just washed his hands
from everything.

354
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,534
Yes, Mr. Gupta.

355
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:04,845
Until now not one
editor-in-charge..

356
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,782
..gave any credit to my vision,
contribution and commitment.

357
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:08,876
Not one.

358
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:13,282
Everyone just made big promises,
big dreams.

359
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,592
Sometimes a pat on my back..

360
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:18,824
..but made big house,
expensive club memberships..

361
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:20,388
..for themselves.

362
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,788
But me..

363
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,925
Have you seen Ashok Mehra's house?

364
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:26,528
lt's a big house.

365
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,161
My house..

366
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:31,442
Sam, you can have a car,
house, everything..

367
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:33,602
But only if you stay in one place.

368
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,539
We never manage to pay the rent,
or credit card bills..

369
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:37,604
..or phone bills on time.

370
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:39,649
We've postponed our marriage twice.

371
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,913
That is not fair. That is not fair.

372
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,621
l never postponed our marriage.

373
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:46,156
lt was your father.

374
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:47,349
He's the one who always said..

375
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:49,485
..Marry a man with class,
not some TV performer.

376
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:51,795
Sorry to say but
l'm no TV performer.

377
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:53,590
l don't crack jokes on television.

378
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,797
l'm a serious investigative
journalist.

379
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:05,610
Oh my, God. Your nose is bleeding.

380
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:08,907
Have you been taking
sleeping pills again?

381
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:10,337
Sometimes?

382
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:19,146
Hello.

383
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:20,314
l can't hear you?

384
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,548
Hello.

385
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,216
Hello.

386
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,188
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

387
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:28,488
Who is it?
- Don't know.

388
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,531
Can't hear.

389
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:30,591
Some Rita..

390
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:34,728
Hello.
- Yes.

391
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,435
ls that Mr. Grover?
- Yeah.

392
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:37,705
Who is speaking?

393
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:39,334
Hi, my name is Lisa Kapoor..

394
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:41,311
..and l'm from the
President Corporate Affairs.

395
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,540
lt's a big media company.
- Yes.

396
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,550
Mr. Grover,
l admire your reporting style.

397
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:50,221
Your praises is
like music to my ears.

398
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:53,482
l've heard from
my sources that you..

399
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:56,192
l resigned.
- l thought so too.

400
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:58,522
Well, our channel's
in the process of..

401
00:21:58,631 --> 00:21:59,962
..hiring a man for the top job.

402
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:01,625
What's the name of your channel?

403
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,394
lf we can meet over
a cup of coffee..

404
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:05,164
..then maybe it'll
be the end of our search?

405
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:08,272
Okay, l suggest that
you call me tomorrow morning.

406
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,399
l'm taking the 2 am flight
to Kuala Lampur today.

407
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:12,307
And will return only next week.

408
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:14,269
You mean you want
to meet right now.

409
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:15,540
l can come wherever you are.

410
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:17,108
Can't we meet tomorrow morning?

411
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,349
Mr. Grover,
l'm talking about a top job.

412
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,248
Top job as in?
- Editor-in-chief.

413
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:26,256
What channel did you say?
What's the name?

414
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:28,188
Just five minutes,
and the decision will be yours.

415
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:30,751
Fine, where can we meet?

416
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:32,490
Like l said, wherever you are.

417
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:34,799
l suggest let's meet
up at Crown Plaza.

418
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:36,423
Perfect.

419
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:37,624
Alright.

420
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:57,744
Mr. Grover.

421
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:00,757
Lisa Kapoor.

422
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:01,882
Hi, Lisa.

423
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,256
Wow!

424
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:12,432
So, right now l'm
with Samar Grover.

425
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,099
l don't believe it.

426
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,102
l'm a big fan.

427
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:18,468
l've been tracking
all your stories.

428
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:20,677
So what channel do you work for?

429
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,602
Crime 24.

430
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,407
Yes, l know.

431
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:28,610
We're really sorry for
what happened with Shubroto.

432
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:32,755
Ever since he lost the
custody of his children..

433
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:34,517
..he was very worried.

434
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:37,252
Roger paid a heavy
compensation to Suhasini?

435
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:37,919
Roger?

436
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:39,630
Roger Khanna. My boss.

437
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,130
How is Roger Khanna
involved in all this?

438
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:43,166
Like l said.. he's my boss.

439
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,869
And he also owns Crime 24.

440
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,730
Few years ago l heard a rumour..

441
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,242
..that Roger was involved
in a Russian arms deal.

442
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:55,408
Well, like you said.
lt was a rumour.

443
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,374
And to tell you the truth,
Roger was framed.

444
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,445
Look, to be honest..

445
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,516
..at the moment l am
considering some offers.

446
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:05,486
And if l'm allowed to ask,
what offers?

447
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:08,719
Associate EP. My own show.

448
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:11,526
l not talking about a show..

449
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:14,564
..l'm talking about
an entire channel here.

450
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,430
Right now l'm trying
to understand Why me.

451
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,798
Because when you were new..

452
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:22,333
..everyone had great
expectations from you.

453
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,740
But regretfully..
- lt was due to some reasons..

454
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,573
..that was beyond my control,
Ms. Lisa.

455
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,771
l can understand.

456
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:32,215
You fell prey to censorship.

457
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:35,215
The editorial control
is controlling you.

458
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:37,378
People are playing
corporate games with you.

459
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:41,386
lt's like you've been
held behind a glass wall.

460
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,152
Gagged. Caged and bound.

461
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:48,833
Samar, l'm offering you a
key to your professional liberty.

462
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:53,798
Roger believes in
the kind of news you do.

463
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:55,497
Real news!

464
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,567
Ms. Lisa,
that's exactly what l get to hear..

465
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:00,202
..in every channel
in the beginning.

466
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,143
l am sorry but l cannot
consider your offer.

467
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:06,282
Just as a piece of advice,
l'd like to say..

468
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:11,214
..that you're rejecting
a 'once-in-a-lifetime offer.

469
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:15,491
Opportunities always come
to those who look for one.

470
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:18,519
l want to move ahead
at my own pace, Lisa.

471
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,593
Samar, we just want
to tell the truth..

472
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,463
..and we aren't afraid of it.

473
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:23,857
Thanks, but no thanks.

474
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,729
Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.

475
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:27,867
Goodnight

476
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:29,095
Goodnight

477
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:46,819
ls he really an arms-dealer?

478
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,426
l've seen him in exhibitions
and art-galleries.

479
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,220
He's always with a lot of security.

480
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:54,924
On the launch of
his channel Crime 24..

481
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,135
..Roger landed from
a hot-air balloon..

482
00:25:57,202 --> 00:25:58,567
..with three bikini-clad girls.

483
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,438
Some people can go to
any limits for publicity.

484
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:06,703
And he stated that 6 months
later his channel will be no.1 .

485
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:09,507
God knows which position he's now.

486
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:34,103
Gagged. Caged and bound.

487
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,638
Gagged. Caged and bound.

488
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,879
Mr. Grover. Good morning.

489
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,114
Lisa, is your offer still open?

490
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:29,383
Not offer, Mr. Grover, opportunity.

491
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:30,784
Call me Sam.

492
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:33,296
Alright. Do you have
a valid passport, Sam?

493
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,889
Yeah.

494
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:42,863
And it'll look beautiful
in the house.

495
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:44,764
Excuse me.

496
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:48,270
Hello.
- Hello.

497
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:49,703
Yes.

498
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:52,446
Listen. l am going to Kuala Lumpur.

499
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:55,642
You're joking.

500
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:39,652
What is Roger doing here?

501
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,326
Sorry?

502
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:48,430
What is Roger doing
in Kuala Lumpur?

503
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:23,604
Roger!
- What?

504
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:25,876
Samar Grover.

505
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:27,367
Hey, Samar.

506
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,845
Come, let's go for a drive.
- No.

507
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:31,310
You got to be kidding me. No!

508
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,883
Come on. Come in.
- Come on, go.

509
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:36,653
Jump in!
- Let's go for a drive.

510
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:38,319
Come on, come on.

511
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,381
Thanks for making my death so easy.

512
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:42,620
You won't even know you're dead.

513
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,159
Oh man!

514
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:58,675
Scared?
- l shouldn't be?

515
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:00,706
Really scared.

516
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:04,374
Good. Fear is
essential for survival.

517
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:07,475
Are you worried about
Shubroto's position?

518
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:11,551
l mean any superstition?

519
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,386
l don't believe in these things.

520
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,482
Good, very good.

521
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,687
Only the weak believe
in superstitions.

522
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:21,129
What's the aim of your life?
- To be successful.

523
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:26,599
Even a wench can be successful,
and so can be a criminal.

524
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,736
You should have a aim in life..

525
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:30,333
..so that the world remembers you.

526
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:34,677
ln today's world, bad is good.

527
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:36,478
Bad news is good news.

528
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,945
More than 80% of people
like watching..

529
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,750
..double, triple murder, rape,
crime news..

530
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:43,381
..and not some musical show.

531
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:44,577
Do you know why?

532
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,890
Because these stories excite them?

533
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:51,252
lt creates a sensation
in their blood.

534
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:56,156
And l want these people
to watch only my channel.

535
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:59,402
We shall show the world
what they want to see.

536
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,106
Can you do that?
- l can try.

537
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,165
That means you aren't sure.

538
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:07,777
Do you believe in yourself?

539
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,370
l can be sure of that.

540
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,235
That's okay.

541
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:45,741
But remember one thing.

542
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:51,620
Either l'll take the right way
or the backdoor.

543
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:54,548
lf we strike a
deal on a good note..

544
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,827
..then you'll maintain your
managerial control.

545
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,797
lf l choose the other way..

546
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:02,324
..then you won't have any
option to choose.

547
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:04,691
Not Tuesday, Monday.

548
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:08,795
Samar.

549
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:12,736
Either lead or get out
of the way, right?

550
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,175
But this isn't warning, right?
- No.

551
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:17,472
l don't believe in warnings.

552
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:21,547
You know, Samar, any society..

553
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,347
..is incomplete without crime
and criminals.

554
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:27,221
That's why a society creates
situations for a crime..

555
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:30,388
..and criminals
accomplish the task.

556
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:34,163
And l.. l broadcast that.

557
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,931
l tell the world Watch, fear.

558
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,795
Fear, watch.

559
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:52,815
l started from zero in life.

560
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:59,151
And l kept adding those zeros
in my bank account.

561
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:02,853
And today.. it's all before you.

562
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:07,592
So tell me, how did you get
attracted towards crime reporting?

563
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:13,164
When l was four my..
mother left my father.

564
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:14,861
And me too.

565
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:16,535
My father was a drunkard.

566
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:18,576
l can understand why she left him..

567
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:20,566
..but why did she leave me?

568
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,106
My efforts to investigate
this reason..

569
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:27,579
..slowly turned into an obsession.

570
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:29,542
And did you learn the truth?

571
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,914
Every truth is revealed in one
way or another.

572
00:33:36,761 --> 00:33:37,750
Cheers!

573
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:48,899
Roger's like Raavan!

574
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:50,530
What do you mean?

575
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,268
He has ten faces.

576
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:56,812
How long have you been with Roger?

577
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:58,948
Around four years.

578
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:01,150
l was selected in Wharton.

579
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:03,242
Wharton.

580
00:34:57,142 --> 00:35:02,341
Don't know what's this desire
burning in me.

581
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:07,750
Why are my eyes seeing things?

582
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:16,151
They stay awake,
and has lost all slumber.

583
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:21,193
What's happening with me?

584
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:29,330
Your lips have
shown me a new life.

585
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:36,136
Can't live without you now.

586
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:42,911
l feel.. you're the best for me.

587
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:49,649
lt's difficult
to stay without you.

588
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:56,427
lt's not easy.

589
00:35:56,568 --> 00:36:02,598
lt's not easy.

590
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:29,300
Let me dwell in your heart..
and forget this world.

591
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:37,502
No distance between us.

592
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:42,836
The heart's lifeless without you.

593
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:50,620
My eyes crave for
you every moment.

594
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:57,419
Without you, my world's impossible
to believe.

595
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:04,293
You completed me.

596
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:10,873
Stay away for you, even in dreams
it's difficult for me.

597
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:17,442
lt's difficult for me.

598
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:24,186
lt's difficult for me.

599
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:35,360
Sorry, Lisa. l can't.

600
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:38,565
l'm in a relationship.

601
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:40,626
Sorry.

602
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,676
Relationships are like TV screen
images, Samar.

603
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:50,842
They seem interesting,
only when they change..

604
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:52,881
And that's how a story is made.

605
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,809
Relationships should change too.

606
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:58,416
And that's the ultimate truth.

607
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:04,824
l don't make relationships
interesting.

608
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:08,322
And l am not interested
in making a story..

609
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,491
..of relations either.

610
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:16,796
Goodnight.

611
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:44,096
1 .5 crores annual remuneration..

612
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:46,295
..with 15% increase every year.

613
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:47,838
Plus performance related perks.

614
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:49,167
Stock options.

615
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:51,904
Company car.

616
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:55,474
Why? - Meaning?

617
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:57,844
l mean all this is too much.

618
00:38:57,915 --> 00:38:59,678
You mean to say l don't
deserve all this?

619
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:00,709
l'm not worth it.

620
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:02,582
Sam, that isn't what l meant?

621
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:05,212
Ahana, l can clearly understand
what you're trying to say.

622
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:08,681
Okay.

623
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,290
l am sorry.

624
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:11,794
You know l'm just being
my cynical self.

625
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:13,628
l am really happy for you, Sam.

626
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:16,861
Tell your dad that Samar won't
just make news..

627
00:39:17,735 --> 00:39:19,100
..now he'll be one too.

628
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:22,137
And pack your bags.

629
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,207
Why? Where are we going?

630
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:25,765
Holiday.

631
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:29,404
Two tickets to.. Maldives.

632
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:30,703
Oh my, God.

633
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:33,105
Thank you.

634
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,509
My heart was my best buddy.

635
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:05,578
Earlier was all for me.

636
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:15,892
Once my heart was my best buddy.

637
00:40:16,594 --> 00:40:20,462
Earlier was all for me.

638
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:26,660
Then what wonder
what happened suddenly.

639
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:30,797
lt's been influenced
by someone greatly.

640
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:35,744
lt's my heart,
but doesn't listen to me.

641
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:40,851
Does it meet your heart secretly?

642
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:46,151
Does it betray me secretly?

643
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:51,426
Does it meet your heart secretly?

644
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:56,724
Does it betray me secretly?

645
00:40:56,801 --> 00:41:01,761
Does it meet your heart secretly?

646
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:09,336
Does it betray me secretly?

647
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:22,392
lt treats me so strangely.

648
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:27,253
Doesn't even take pity on me.

649
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:37,707
lt treats me so strangely.

650
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:42,469
Doesn't even take pity on me.

651
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:48,142
Wonder who it's
been influenced by?

652
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:53,555
Holding all my secrets within.

653
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:57,692
But those secrets are
still unknown to me.

654
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:02,732
Does it meet your heart secretly?

655
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:08,361
Does it betray me secretly?

656
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:12,875
Does it meet your heart secretly?

657
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:18,507
Does it betray me secretly?

658
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:46,332
Are you happy, Sam?

659
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:49,268
How do you know?

660
00:42:50,147 --> 00:42:51,136
l know you.

661
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:52,838
l see.

662
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:54,276
l know, don't l?

663
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:09,522
Roger believes more
than 80% of the people..

664
00:44:09,593 --> 00:44:10,855
..like to watch crime news.

665
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:14,256
They want to see shocking,
sensational news.

666
00:44:14,732 --> 00:44:15,562
l believe that too.

667
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:17,567
We'll make a 12 hour time
crime capsule.

668
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:19,761
The mornings will begin with the
programme 'Red Dawn'

669
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:22,169
Here we'll show crimes
committed last night.

670
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,308
After that we'll have a 2 hour
special show.

671
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:25,238
'Killing Time.'

672
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:26,333
Here we'll show breaking news..

673
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,502
..committed before 12 pm.

674
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:30,638
Afternoons will begin with our
show 'M for Murder'.

675
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:33,174
This will show the crimes committed
in the entire world.

676
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,445
After that, a special show being
committed on the streets.

677
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,414
'An investigation of the scene
of the crime.'

678
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:38,477
'Final Cut.'

679
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:40,484
And finally, my flagship show.

680
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:41,814
'3rd Eye.'

681
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,352
We've to show big crimes.

682
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:45,754
And in close-up.

683
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:47,653
lf we fail to do that..

684
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,629
..then there'll be a big close-up
of us on the screen.

685
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:50,923
'Dead!'

686
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:02,434
Lights!

687
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:10,076
lt's great. Yeah!

688
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:11,643
Samar.

689
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:17,423
Any news can be big, breaking
and effective..

690
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:19,892
..only when it's shown first.

691
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:22,425
So the question is..

692
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:25,427
..how do we broadcast
any news first?

693
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,261
Contacts. Reliable sources.

694
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:30,604
Police's media relation offices.

695
00:45:31,308 --> 00:45:32,536
And through some reliable sources..

696
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,838
..that give me the news first.

697
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:35,669
That's what you think.

698
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:38,705
And anyway, l'm not talking
about Delhi alone.

699
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,346
l am talking about
the entire country.

700
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:44,251
Come on, let me show you
something else.

701
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:48,548
ln today's age the more reliable
source is technology.

702
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:50,591
Technology helps everyone.

703
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:52,786
The police. Criminals.

704
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:55,663
And also people like us
who create history.

705
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:57,928
Every police station
in the country..

706
00:45:58,169 --> 00:45:59,329
..has a mobile helpline.

707
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:02,802
And with the help of our friends
in the telecom industry..

708
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,140
..l've setup a small system.

709
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:08,675
But that's phone tapping.
lt's illegal.

710
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,475
Everyone does everything that's
illegal in this world.

711
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:13,576
Show me your mobile phone.

712
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:19,619
Wow. Good one.

713
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:22,625
Did you buy it from a showroom?

714
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:25,328
That means this is illegal too.

715
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,829
Samar, nothings right or wrong.

716
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:33,102
Our view point makes it so.

717
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,435
So, can we tap the police
landlines as well?

718
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,340
We use ENCORE CRC.

719
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:44,170
lt's a simple program that runs
on Windows.

720
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:47,350
Every police officer in 44 cities.

721
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:51,280
Their voice, their secrets
and much more.

722
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:55,855
That means we'll broadcast every
breaking news first.

723
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:58,328
The other channels don't
stand a chance..

724
00:46:58,395 --> 00:46:59,384
..they will be wiped out.

725
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:01,055
You're talking
about 80% viewership.

726
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:02,859
That's a cakewalk.
We'll get a 100%.

727
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:05,600
Everyone's in a hurry to telecast
the news first.

728
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,159
Now we'll show them.

729
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:10,497
l want my channel to be no.1 .

730
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:11,864
At any cost.

731
00:47:13,177 --> 00:47:15,145
And l am not doing
this to make money.

732
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:18,271
l have other ways to make money.

733
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,212
l want to teach a lesson
to few people.

734
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:26,181
We'll blow them away.

735
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,756
Hello. l am Cujo.

736
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:36,500
Head of security, Crime 24.

737
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:40,596
l haven't heard much but
l've seen you a lot.

738
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:43,299
But today when l did, l realised..

739
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:44,773
..that l heard right about you.

740
00:47:45,543 --> 00:47:46,771
The real reason that l am here.

741
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:52,604
Phone.

742
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:55,980
See you, bye.

743
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:06,587
We'll do that post-break.

744
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:11,632
Okay, ready to go.
3-2-1 .

745
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:19,267
Hello and welcome to Crime 24.

746
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:21,311
This is Samar Grover,
your friend and host.

747
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:23,004
And we've with us an image from
the crime world..

748
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,138
..from the entire day.

749
00:48:24,214 --> 00:48:26,273
First we'll see the situation of
crime in the three metros.

750
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:29,478
And now we're connecting live with
our dynamic and dashing reporter.

751
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:30,551
Madhu Bist from Delhi.

752
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:32,020
Aniban Chaudhary from Kolkata.

753
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,316
And Radha Saklani from Mumbai.

754
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,120
Good evening, Samar.
- Good evening everyone.

755
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:37,592
Madhu, first tell us..

756
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,092
..how was your day in Delhi.

757
00:48:39,163 --> 00:48:40,596
The fire broke out
this morning at 8..

758
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:43,394
..and you can imagine its fury
with the fact that..

759
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,195
..it hasn't been doused yet.

760
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:46,996
Seven fire-engines of the
Delhi fire-brigade..

761
00:48:47,071 --> 00:48:48,732
..are still trying
to douse the fire.

762
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:50,370
Now let's turn to Mumbai.

763
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:53,272
Our crime reporter Radha's present
at the scene of the crime.

764
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:56,278
Mr. Sharma went out for
his business news..

765
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,472
..but what happened after that?

766
00:48:57,648 --> 00:49:00,048
His wife and both children
were murdered.

767
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:02,581
Let's take a look at
the news of Delhi.

768
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:05,421
The faces of both the children
were badly burnt.

769
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:08,353
The girl jumped from 25th floor
and committed suicide.

770
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:15,022
The corpses kept in the wood
storehouse were gagged.

771
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:17,258
Call it coincidence or a miracle..

772
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:20,632
..but the murderers of Noida
MLA Raghunath Yadav..

773
00:49:20,704 --> 00:49:22,331
..couldn't escape our alert eye.

774
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:23,532
l saw that a car was parked there.

775
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,575
They just came, shot and left.
That's all.

776
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:27,644
The police arrived late.
Around 15-20 minutes later.

777
00:49:28,045 --> 00:49:30,036
Don't you think the police is
making false assumptions..

778
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:32,378
..in the Bangalore Swami
triple murder case?

779
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:34,383
Who says we're making
false assumptions?

780
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:36,351
15 students are
dead and 50 injured..

781
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,149
..who have been admitted
in this hospital.

782
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:40,713
Last evening, two people died
and one was injured..

783
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:42,458
..in the communal quarrel.

784
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:44,584
Aditya Bhalla was well known..

785
00:49:44,662 --> 00:49:47,392
..for speaking the truth.

786
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,590
He always supported the truth.

787
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:51,064
Hold on.

788
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:52,602
This is an exclusive footage
from Crime 24..

789
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,695
..and no one else has this.

790
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,970
This murder..

791
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,201
The corpse was cut
up in 300 pieces..

792
00:49:58,308 --> 00:49:59,297
The girl's throat was slit..

793
00:49:59,376 --> 00:50:00,308
Burnt alive..

794
00:50:00,377 --> 00:50:01,309
And hanged himself.

795
00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:02,470
14 year old girl..

796
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:04,138
How can anyone be so cruel?

797
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:07,243
Definitely, Crime 24 was
the first to arrive.

798
00:50:07,317 --> 00:50:09,251
lt always has, and always will.

799
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,478
Crime 24..

800
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:12,522
Will expose the bare truth
of the society..

801
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:13,555
Crime 24..

802
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:15,023
..with the crack of the gong.

803
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:16,423
News at any cost.

804
00:50:17,494 --> 00:50:19,587
Your channel has
violated BRAl rule..

805
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:24,657
..for subject matter treatment
rule no. 10, 1 1 , 14, 16

806
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:27,236
Etcetera. Etcetera.

Secretary, lnformation
and Broadcasting ministry.

809
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:34,507
They want to serve us a notice..

810
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:37,306
..and they want us to suspend
our broadcast.

811
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:38,541
Mr. V.N Dixit.

812
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:41,241
Wasn't he arrested
for sexual harassment?

813
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:42,607
You're right.

814
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,509
Cujo.

815
00:50:45,022 --> 00:50:46,353

Would you like to count it?
- Of course not.

818
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:17,076
Who is it now?
- Relax, Mr. Dixit.

819

l never saw such accurate and
fast reporting..

834
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:02,660
..in the last 15 years.

835
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,968
How do they find out about every
crime before the police?

836
00:52:07,037 --> 00:52:09,562
Crime 24 has completely changed..

837
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,574
..the direction and terms
of crime reporting.

838
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:23,212

..he's brought a revolution in
the world of reporting.

840

Action.

Ahana, it's not what it looks like.

888
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:40,205
lt' s all nonsense.

889
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:41,575
What do you think what it is?

890
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:43,984
Everything's so clear, Sam.

891
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:47,122
Ahana, you know how loud the
music is in nightclub's.

892
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:49,552
l was whispering something
in her ears.

893
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:51,526
You never whisper like this
in my ears.

894
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:54,557
What has she got?

895
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:56,660
What about her fascinates you?

896
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,566
l mean look at her all over you
with polished nails..

897
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:01,433
..and plastic lips.
- Ahana, please stop it.

898
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:07,999
Ahana.

899
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:21,722
Hi, is this Lisa Kapoor.
- Yes, this is Lisa.

900
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:23,453
My name's Ahana Sharma.

901
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,961
Oh! Hi, Ahana.
l didn't recognise you.

902
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:29,495
Can we meet somewhere?

903
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,657
Why don't you come to our office?

904
00:56:31,902 --> 00:56:34,029
That way you can see our office too.
- No.

905
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:36,165
No, let's meet
somewhere else, please.

906
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:40,000
Sure. Okay.

907
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:04,522
Say hi. Say hi.

908
00:57:04,668 --> 00:57:06,533
Wave your hands.

909
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,059
Sir, you want to shoot.

910
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:10,071
Come, come, come.
l'll go play with kids.

911
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:11,296
Yeah, come.

912
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:15,100
Come on, come on.

913
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:17,341
Rikin.
- Come on.

914
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:20,049
Sit on the swing. Swing, swing.

915
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:22,474
Yes.

916
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:23,541
Sit.

917
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,015
Next page. lnitials.

918
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,079
Sorry, sorry.

919
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:31,257
And this page.

920
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:32,317
Lisa.

921
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:34,427
Did Rikin work here?
- Who?

922
00:57:35,098 --> 00:57:36,622
Rikin. Rikin Chawla.
He's on this tape.

923
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:38,631
What tape?
- Don't know.

924
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:42,471
lt shows Rikin and Shubroto in
a jungle with some naxal kids.

925
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:46,198
Oh.. Rikin, of course.

926
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:49,636
Rikin and l were together in
a media workshop few years ago.

927
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:52,347
l mean Rikin did work here.

928
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:54,550
He suddenly disappeared one day.

929
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:55,982
He didn't collect
his salary either.

930
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:57,108
lt's really weird.

931
00:57:57,587 --> 00:57:59,282
That's Rikin. He's slightly crazy.

932
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:00,714
He can do anything.

933
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:02,981
Alright.

934
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:05,486
Mr .Grover, good thing you
found this tape.

935
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:07,086
Allow me to keep it somewhere safe.

936
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:08,193
Thank you.

937
00:58:08,265 --> 00:58:10,130
Anyway. l haven't met him for
a long time.

938
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:11,359
l'll contact him.
- Yup.

939
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:23,635
Hi.

940
00:58:24,181 --> 00:58:26,342
Hi. Lisa Kapoor.

941
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:35,249
l guess a woman that believes
in one night stands..

942
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:40,327
..and changing affairs can understand
the meaning of a relationship.

943
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,721
l am sorry. What do you mean?

944
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:48,234
l can tell you're pretending,
Ms. Kapoor.

945
00:58:48,638 --> 00:58:50,606
Why don't you pick someone else
for spending your nights with?

946
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:52,330
Oh!

947
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:57,044
Are you accusing me
of seducing Samar?

948
00:58:57,581 --> 00:58:58,570
Well, Ms. Sharma.

949
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:02,582
My advice is that
you control Samar..

950
00:59:02,786 --> 00:59:06,620
..rather that accusing others.

951
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:09,023
lf there's a problem
between you two..

952
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:11,025
..then that's your problem,
not mine.

953
00:59:11,127 --> 00:59:12,116
Get it.

954
00:59:22,305 --> 00:59:26,765
The lDEA no you're trying to call
is out of coverage area.

955
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:06,404
Hi, Samar.

956
01:00:07,751 --> 01:00:08,740
Rikin!

957
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:11,084
How.. how are you?

958
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:14,456
So they gave you a penthouse too.

959
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:16,614
Yes.

960
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:19,322
And a BMW.
- Yeah.

961
01:00:19,796 --> 01:00:21,263
They must have given you
a gold card as well.

962
01:00:26,803 --> 01:00:29,033
What happened with Shubroto is
much more important, Samar.

963
01:00:30,173 --> 01:00:31,037
What happened with Shubroto?

964
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:33,473
He killed Shubroto.
- Who killed Shubroto?

965
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:36,644
That bastard Cujo.

966
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:37,638
Cujo?

967
01:00:37,714 --> 01:00:38,681
By drowning him in a river..

968
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:40,113
..so that it looks
like an accident.

969
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:43,219
Except for installing cellular
scanners and phone tapping..

970
01:00:43,286 --> 01:00:45,311
..technology-wise Crime 24 is
way behind other channels.

971
01:00:45,622 --> 01:00:46,680
How's that possible?

972
01:00:46,756 --> 01:00:48,951
Crime 24 has.. - Crime 24 can
have Samar Grover..

973
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:51,186
..lndia's best crime reporter,
but technology-wise..

974
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:52,956
..that channel's a big zero.

975
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:54,995
Everything that you saw.

976
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:56,425
The ultra-modern setup.

977
01:00:58,568 --> 01:00:59,967
You get that in Palika Bazaar.

978
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:03,637
And for cheap. - But what you're
saying is very far-fetched.

979
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:07,007
The race for live news is won
by OB van. Right? - Yes.

980
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,341
NDTV has 40 OB vans.

981
01:01:10,413 --> 01:01:11,710
How many does Crime 24 have?

982
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:15,713
1 1 !
- Rikin..

983
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:24,583
He was certain that Cujo
and his men..

984
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:26,526
..are committing murders
for news coverage.

985
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:29,061
They're staging road accidents,
industrial accidents.

986
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:32,132
Loot-plunder, shooting, everything.

987
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:35,962
What an idea to stay ahead
in business, right?

988
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:37,696
You and your conspiracy theories.

989
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:39,532
Come up with me.
Let's have a drink.

990
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,599
Come on.

991
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:43,238
You've sold yourself, Samar.

992
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:46,081
Now you're one of them.

993
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:51,952
Your house, your office,
your car everything's tapped.

994
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:57,758
Maybe you're watched and heard
everywhere you go.

995
01:01:58,561 --> 01:01:59,550
What will you do?

996
01:02:01,965 --> 01:02:03,125
What are you going to do?

997
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,533
l hope you find an answer
while you're still alive.

998
01:02:10,473 --> 01:02:11,462
You're dead, Sam.

999
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:13,131
We're all dead.

1000
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:15,070
Rikin..
- You're dead, Sam.

1001
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:16,975
You're dead. We're all dead.

1002
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:18,273
Rinkin.
- You're dead, Sam.

1003
01:02:18,348 --> 01:02:19,474
lt's all over.
- Rikin.

1004
01:03:16,105 --> 01:03:17,265
Ahana, where are you going?

1005
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:19,997
Back to Mumbai.

1006
01:03:20,376 --> 01:03:22,310
Ahana, how many
times do l say this?

1007
01:03:22,745 --> 01:03:24,110
How many times will l have
to explain you?

1008
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,007
There's nothing going
on between me and Lisa.

1009
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:28,606
l'll have to.

1010
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:31,382
This is why l stood beside you.

1011
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:34,681
l slowed down so that..

1012
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:37,184
..you don't lag behind in life.

1013
01:03:37,494 --> 01:03:39,018
But why don't believe me?

1014
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:40,387
Why don't believe me dammit?

1015
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:45,594
Ahana, listen to me.

1016
01:03:46,135 --> 01:03:47,124
l just don't understand.

1017
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:48,593
l don't know what to say.

1018
01:03:49,172 --> 01:03:50,264
No need to say anything.

1019
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:52,472
l'll leave tomorrow evening.

1020
01:03:53,676 --> 01:03:57,442
l wanted to leave today but all
the flights are booked, so..

1021
01:03:57,981 --> 01:03:59,539
Look, Ahana, you're very upset
at the moment..

1022
01:03:59,616 --> 01:04:00,742
..and l am too tensed.

1023
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:02,218
Let's just sleep over it.

1024
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:03,479
We'll talk in the morning.

1025
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:05,510
Okay, sweetheart.

1026
01:04:05,755 --> 01:04:06,744
Ahana.

1027
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:26,534
ln recent news,
a man hanged himself to death..

1028
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:28,737
..in a hotel in Pahadganj.

1029
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:32,003
Our correspondent was first to
reach the scene of the crime..

1030
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:33,598
..like always.

1031
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:37,575
The deceased's real name is Rikin.

1032
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:41,375
According the police
no suicide letter..

1033
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:43,351
..was found with the corpse.

1034
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:46,553
The hotel's manager stated man..

1035
01:05:46,723 --> 01:05:49,123
..this man has been living here
for a long time..

1036
01:05:49,258 --> 01:05:51,021
..under a fake name.

1037
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:53,459
Our correspondents believe..

1038
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,427
..that he can have connections
with the underworld.

1039
01:06:02,972 --> 01:06:03,961
Yeah, Lisa.

1040
01:06:05,308 --> 01:06:06,502
Lisa, l'm busy right now.

1041
01:06:06,943 --> 01:06:08,001
Can l call you back?

1042
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:13,079
No, my program's about to start so,
l'll call you back.

1043
01:06:14,384 --> 01:06:16,215
l'll call you back, bye.

1044
01:06:51,354 --> 01:06:53,982
'He killed Shubroto.
- Who 'killed Shubroto?'

1045
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:55,522
'That bastard Cujo.'

1046
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:56,615
'By drowning him in a river..'

1047
01:06:56,693 --> 01:06:57,990

'..technology-wise Crime 24 is

1050
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:04,292
'How's that possible?'

1051
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:05,994
'Crime 24 can 'have Samar Grover..'

1052
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:08,333
'..lndia's best crime reporter,
but technology-wise..'

1053
01:07:08,404 --> 01:07:09,962
'..that channel's a big zero.'

01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:31,583
'He was certain that Cujo
and his men..'

1064
01:07:31,694 --> 01:07:34,185
'..are committing murders
for news coverage.'

1065
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,395
'They're staging road accidents,
industrial accidents.'

1066
01:07:36,466 --> 01:07:38,627
'Loot-plunder,
shooting, everything.'

1067
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:41,060
'Everything that makes live news.'

1068
01:07:41,237 --> 01:07:44,536
'Railway stations. Airports.
Bus stops.'

1069
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:49,001
'Everywhere. Cujo and his men
are looking all over for me.'

1070
01:07:49,178 --> 01:07:51,043
'With my photo in one hand and
a gun in the other.'

1071
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:52,503
'What will you do?'

1072
01:07:54,617 --> 01:07:55,606
'What are you going to do?'

1073
01:07:56,652 --> 01:07:59,280
'l hope you find an answer
while you're still alive.'

1074
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,589
'You're dead, Sam.'
'We're all dead.'

1075
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:07,492
Mr. Grover.

1076
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:09,325
Samar, where were you?

1077
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:10,625
lt's time for the telecast.

1078
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,529
Come on.
- l..

1079
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:13,791
Come on.

1080
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:20,704
What else? l just went up to her
and slipped my hand inside.

1081
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:23,307
l slipped it inside her T-shirt
and she started screaming.

1082
01:08:23,446 --> 01:08:24,538
'Vicky, leave me, leave me.'

1083
01:08:25,181 --> 01:08:26,773
That's all you can do.
- Yeah.

1084
01:08:27,717 --> 01:08:32,154
lt felt like l was pressing
a cloth-ball.

1085
01:08:33,156 --> 01:08:35,317
Later l found out it was a cloth.

1086
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:39,352
lt's the cops.

1087
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:41,753
Hide the bottle?
- But where?

1088
01:08:41,998 --> 01:08:43,022
Keep it down somewhere.

1089
01:09:06,222 --> 01:09:07,519
Good evening, Sam.

1090
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:10,718
l'm reporting live from the scene
of the crime.

1091
01:09:10,793 --> 01:09:13,762
Three youngsters were
brutally murdered.

1092
01:09:13,996 --> 01:09:15,657
All three belonged
to a good family..

1093
01:09:15,731 --> 01:09:17,255
..and attended Hindu College.

1094
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:19,993
And they were on their way
to Manali for vacations.

1095
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:21,325
Welcome to..

1096
01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:26,463
Crime 24.

1097
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:31,671
We bring you the..
the crime world..

1098
01:10:25,668 --> 01:10:28,136
Hello. - You've been avoiding me
the entire day..

1099
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:29,965
..and it's really important
for us to talk.

1100
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:32,040
That's why l called.
- l see.

1101
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:36,103
Why? - Because, Samar,
we know that you know.

1102
01:10:36,379 --> 01:10:39,212
Didn't l say the truth will be
revealed someday?

1103
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:41,440
This is just like
your hitman story..

1104
01:10:41,684 --> 01:10:43,379
..little truth and more lies.

1105
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:45,511
And that's why you chose me
to tell your story.

1106
01:10:45,588 --> 01:10:47,419
You thought l'm ambitious,
l'll get corrupted easily.

1107
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,285
Just because l want to
say something, l'll stay quiet.

1108
01:10:49,558 --> 01:10:51,287
l want to be successful,
so l'll turn in my soul.

1109
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:55,196
And don't use the hitman story
to justify your crimes..

1110
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:56,697
..that story was absolutely true.

1111
01:10:57,066 --> 01:10:58,158
You should've told me in
the beginning.

1112
01:10:58,301 --> 01:10:59,233
At least l would've known..

1113
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:00,633
..that l was opting to be
a criminal, not a crime reporter.

1114
01:11:00,703 --> 01:11:03,399
Oh, for God sake no need to be
so emotional, Samar.

1115
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:07,140
You don't know what Roger
has planned for you.

1116
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:08,673
An apartment in Singapore.

1117
01:11:08,744 --> 01:11:10,143
A vacation home in Lankavi.

1118
01:11:10,346 --> 01:11:11,608
A fulltime directorship.

1119
01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:13,614
Even l have thought a lot
for Roger, Lisa.

1120
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:15,406
Full time torture.

1121
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:17,247
Special cell in Tihar Jail.

1122
01:11:17,987 --> 01:11:19,181
And a vacation home in hell.

1123
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:23,047
Samar.

1124
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:25,354
Samar, please being so stubborn.

1125
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:27,027
Nothing's gone wrong yet.

1126
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:29,121
l promise Ahana
will be left unharmed.

1127
01:11:30,633 --> 01:11:33,067
Just say yes,
l can call it off right now.

1128
01:11:33,135 --> 01:11:36,161
So that you can kill innocent
people for higher TRP ratings.

1129
01:11:36,272 --> 01:11:38,502
For God sake,
don't make me do this, Samar.

1130
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:39,734
Don't make me do this.

1131
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:51,646
Yeah, Sam. - Ahana,
get out of the house now!

1132
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:52,688
l am leaving, Sam.

1133
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:55,315
Get out of the house!
- Chill. l am leaving.

1134
01:12:13,642 --> 01:12:15,769
Hey, Samar.
- Roger, let Ahana go.

1135
01:12:16,245 --> 01:12:17,542
She has nothing
to do with all this.

1136
01:12:17,646 --> 01:12:19,409
l've no interest in Ahana either.

1137
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:21,707
l could never imagine you'd
stoop so low.

1138
01:12:21,784 --> 01:12:24,150
Don't think, Samar.
Just look around you.

1139
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:25,209
Everything's rigged.

1140
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:27,778
Politicians, politics, bureaucracy,
cricket match.

1141
01:12:28,224 --> 01:12:30,658
Everything. Notjust in
our country, the entire world.

1142
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,687
There's a rig everywhere.

1143
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:33,986
Roger, let Ahana go.

1144
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,925
You've got a tiff with me.
- Samar.

1145
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:37,627
Ahana will be unharmed.

1146
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:39,525
Please believe me. lt's a promise.

1147
01:12:40,069 --> 01:12:43,402
lf you promise that you'll
fully cooperate with me.

1148
01:12:44,006 --> 01:12:47,999
Do you want Ahana to die for
the people you don't even know?

1149
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:50,340
This is the time
to make history, Samar.

1150
01:12:51,047 --> 01:12:52,514
We can strike gold together.

1151
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:54,649
You are the face of the channel.

1152
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:56,211
Please don't upset me, Samar.

1153
01:12:56,452 --> 01:12:58,249
Roger, you think l'm a fool.

1154
01:12:58,387 --> 01:12:59,479
l know you're buying time, Roger.

1155
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:01,589
That's why l'm not selling it.
And one more thing.

1156
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:04,286
Now the unthinkable will happen.

1157
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,449
Oh, God.

1158
01:13:05,961 --> 01:13:08,486
Remember what you said to
that border officer?

1159
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:11,299
Don't blame me, blame yourself
because you created me.

1160
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:13,626
Just wait and watch.

1161
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:16,161
And now l will destroy you!

1162
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:18,228
Bye, Roger.

1163
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:21,738
Samar's in a mood to play games.

1164
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:25,577
And l don't have the time or
the mood to play with him.

1165
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:29,210
Shall l instruct my men?

1166
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:30,407
Deal with him.

1167
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:31,942
Think about it.

1168
01:13:32,922 --> 01:13:34,219
lf you can change his mind..

1169
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:37,054
..l feel these things
aren't required.

1170
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:47,091
Oh no.

1171
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:35,012
Your fervour..

1172
01:14:35,518 --> 01:14:37,145
l hope you will
enjoy this hotel, sir.

1173
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:38,242
Thanks.

1174
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:44,151
You need some girls, sir.

1175
01:14:44,994 --> 01:14:47,053
l mean girls.
- No.

1176
01:14:47,363 --> 01:14:49,194
Boys.

1177
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:52,600
You need some drugs for relaxing.
- No.

1178
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:54,324
Okay, sir.

1179
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:27,164
Famous painter our editor-in-chief
Samar Grover's fianc..

1180
01:15:27,503 --> 01:15:30,301
..Ahana Sharma was kidnapped
last night.

1181
01:15:30,472 --> 01:15:33,100
Samar's too been missing
after this incident..

1182
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:36,073
..and our effort to contact
him was vain.

1183
01:15:36,145 --> 01:15:38,443
And Samar hasn't contacted us
either.

1184
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:41,211
Hello.

1185
01:15:41,283 --> 01:15:43,410
The person whose picture's being
show on television..

1186
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:45,043
..is staying in our hotel.

1187
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:48,051
Room no.7,
Jubilee Hotel, Pahadganj.

1188
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:17,074
lt's you..

1189
01:16:23,726 --> 01:16:25,489
So they sent me to kill you.

1190
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:27,284
Lucky for you it was me.

1191
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:28,518
What if they sent someone else?

1192
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:35,095
lt's not a reason to rejoice.
lf l don't kill you, they will.

1193
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:38,633
Every tom, dick and harry's
looking for you..

1194
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:41,141
..at every nook and corner with
a gun in his hand.

1195
01:16:42,278 --> 01:16:43,404
l need your help.
- Me?

1196
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:44,468
l cannot do it.

1197
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:46,473
l cannot do it.

1198
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:48,949
l will pay you.
l will pay you good.

1199
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:51,576
Only if l live to take it.

1200
01:16:52,254 --> 01:16:54,119
You don't know who
you're up against.

1201
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:56,157
l know. Roger Khanna!

1202
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,426
He's a powerful man.
He controls everyone.

1203
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:01,990
Look.. l helped you.

1204
01:17:02,197 --> 01:17:03,255
So now l want your help.

1205
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:05,093
l never asked for your help.

1206
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:06,595
You were a nice
man so you helped me.

1207
01:17:06,669 --> 01:17:08,330
But l am not a good person.
l cannot do it.

1208
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:09,735
l said l will pay you.

1209
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:11,973
Money! Money! Money!
So you're rich!

1210
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:13,499
l've money too.

1211
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:16,101
Business is doing good.
This one.

1212
01:17:16,245 --> 01:17:17,234
Keep your money.

1213
01:17:18,347 --> 01:17:21,180
l am leaving. - Why don't you just
say that you're a coward?

1214
01:17:22,985 --> 01:17:24,646
l am not a coward?

1215
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:27,512
l am just acting.

1216
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:28,679
You can call me a liar.

1217
01:17:29,058 --> 01:17:30,047
Just like l lied to you.

1218
01:17:30,626 --> 01:17:32,423
l killed VM Pande.. No.

1219
01:17:32,494 --> 01:17:34,462
What was his name?
l killed VM Shukla.

1220
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,390
That was a joke.

1221
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:38,522
Joke?
- Yeah!

1222
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:39,961
You call that a joke!

1223
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:43,969
Yourjoke's the reason
why l am in this situation.

1224
01:17:44,106 --> 01:17:45,095
You know that.

1225
01:17:45,307 --> 01:17:47,400
All these problems were created
because of your lie.

1226
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:49,132
Calm down.

1227
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:51,636
lf you hadn't lied l wouldn't be..

1228
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,209
He's lost it.

1229
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:52,431
Hi, baby.

1230
01:18:54,977 --> 01:18:56,001
Hello.

1231
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:02,239
Go.

1232
01:19:04,052 --> 01:19:05,041
Bye.

1233
01:19:33,449 --> 01:19:35,747
Thank God l don't believe
in one night stands..

1234
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:38,747
..and changing relations.

1235
01:19:39,555 --> 01:19:41,682
Otherwise what's the point of
a relation..

1236
01:19:41,757 --> 01:19:43,315
..that ends up like this?

1237
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:44,657
Anyway.

1238
01:19:44,726 --> 01:19:49,186
All l want is that
you help yourself.

1239
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:56,494
l am talking about your life,
get that.

1240
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:57,764
And you can lose it.

1241
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:12,617
The kidnappers have sent a tape.

1242
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:16,385
The tape shows Ahana Sharma
in their custody.

1243
01:20:16,558 --> 01:20:20,085
lf the ransom isn't delivered
within 12 hours..

1244
01:20:20,596 --> 01:20:24,191
l think this isn't what it looks like.
- Then no one will find her corpse.

1245
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:27,562
Whether its kidnappers, naxalites,
terrorists.

1246
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:29,465
They all want media attention.

1247
01:20:30,606 --> 01:20:32,938
They want most of the people
to see and hear them.

1248
01:20:33,976 --> 01:20:35,534
So why didn't they send
this tape to us?

1249
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:37,101
Why not the other channels?

1250
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,970
What could be the reason, sir?

1251
01:20:40,249 --> 01:20:43,616
Maybe because this telecast is
for someone special.

1252
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,009
Maybe Sam.

1253
01:20:46,755 --> 01:20:47,585
Sir, sir.

1254
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:49,055
You mean to say that..

1255
01:20:49,124 --> 01:20:51,524
..Samar Grover can be involved
in this kidnapping.

1256
01:20:51,994 --> 01:20:56,260
Look, we cannot say anything
for certain.

1257
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:59,458
Samar, l know that you can see
and hear me.

1258
01:21:00,769 --> 01:21:02,031
l hope you're really fine.

1259
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,069
l really like you.

1260
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,606
l'm sure you remember that
l had said..

1261
01:21:08,443 --> 01:21:11,708
..that only an orphan can help
another orphan.

1262
01:21:12,247 --> 01:21:14,044
Please call me, Samar.
l'm waiting for you.

1263
01:21:14,616 --> 01:21:16,516
Delhi police
believes that Samar Grover..

1264
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:18,652
..can be involved
in this kidnapping.

1265
01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:21,012
According the police
the reason can be..

1266
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:24,587
..to get rich easily,
personal problems..

1267
01:21:24,993 --> 01:21:26,460
..crimes conducted
under an obsession.

1268
01:21:26,662 --> 01:21:27,754
Dangerous love.

1269
01:21:28,297 --> 01:21:30,390
These matters are common nowadays.

1270
01:21:30,465 --> 01:21:34,060
Lovers kill their
companion over small issues.

1271
01:21:35,003 --> 01:21:37,665
The police are searching Samar's
house as we speak. - Come on.

1272
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:44,601
Didn't l tell you?

1273
01:21:45,681 --> 01:21:46,670
He's here.

1274
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:50,979
lt's okay.
We'll deal with it.

1275
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,281
Where is Prince?

1276
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:03,227
lf you find him
somewhere then let me know.

1277
01:22:03,398 --> 01:22:04,387
Okay.

1278
01:22:07,002 --> 01:22:07,991
lt's him.

1279
01:22:08,604 --> 01:22:10,162
Cujo sir, hello.

1280
01:22:10,372 --> 01:22:12,704
Rascal, where are you?
l called you umpteen times.

1281
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:16,569
Cujo, mind your language with me.

1282
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:17,734
First do your dirty jobs..

1283
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,242
..and also listen to your cusses.

1284
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:20,645
Stop barking and tell
me did you do the job?

1285
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:22,005
lt's done.

1286
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:24,578
Couldn't you send me
to kill someone else?

1287
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,620
This one was such a coward. He died
the minute l pulled out my gun.

1288
01:22:27,022 --> 01:22:28,990
l was taking care of his body..

1289
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:30,719
..that's why l couldn't answer
your call.

1290
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:33,018
You can come in the morning..

1291
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:34,619
..and see his dead body yourself.

1292
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:36,022
Why morning?

1293
01:22:36,365 --> 01:22:37,662
Show me his body right now?

1294
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,297
And get myself arrested.

1295
01:22:39,534 --> 01:22:41,024
The police are all around.

1296
01:22:41,336 --> 01:22:42,325
Understand your dog.

1297
01:22:42,704 --> 01:22:45,605
Rascal, l will..
- Sorry.

1298
01:22:46,074 --> 01:22:47,063
Try to understand, Cujo.

1299
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:49,936
There's a gun in the boot of
the car. Bloodstains on the seat.

1300
01:22:50,078 --> 01:22:52,239
l will get arrested instantly.

1301
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:54,947
Then who will do
your dirty jobs, Cujo?

1302
01:22:55,217 --> 01:22:56,081
Get that.

1303
01:22:56,151 --> 01:22:57,675
Come in the morning
and see for yourself.

1304
01:22:58,387 --> 01:22:59,376
Fine.

1305
01:22:59,454 --> 01:23:01,547
And remember, come alone.

1306
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:04,317
l don't like a crowd.
- Okay.

1307
01:23:06,261 --> 01:23:07,250
Come on.

1308
01:23:22,678 --> 01:23:23,667
Tell me something.

1309
01:23:24,312 --> 01:23:26,712
How did Cujo and his men
stage all the accidents..

1310
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:29,946
..and murders in
the entire country?

1311
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:32,546
Have you heard
about Raja Chaudhary?

1312
01:23:33,689 --> 01:23:34,713
Raja Chaudhary?
- No?

1313
01:23:36,091 --> 01:23:37,922
And you call
yourself a crime reporter?

1314
01:23:39,327 --> 01:23:40,419
Have you heard of a
place called Gujjar?

1315
01:23:42,097 --> 01:23:43,086
Yes.
- You did.

1316
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:45,363
So he's the don of Gujjar.

1317
01:23:47,102 --> 01:23:48,091
He's into many things.

1318
01:23:48,704 --> 01:23:51,036
Smuggles drugs,
kidnapping, and extortion.

1319
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:53,964
He runs a racket of girls.

1320
01:23:54,109 --> 01:23:55,474
Sells fake liquor and..

1321
01:23:56,178 --> 01:23:57,167
And much more.

1322
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,646
'A man can earn a
truckload of money..'

1323
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,407
'..but it isn't
easy to earn respect.'

1324
01:24:03,585 --> 01:24:05,416
'l finally know
and understand this.'

1325
01:24:05,987 --> 01:24:07,955
'So now l want to earn respect.'

1326
01:24:08,156 --> 01:24:09,680
'l want to make a name for myself.'

1327
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:13,957
'l hope you understood, lady.'

1328
01:24:14,129 --> 01:24:15,756
'Mr. Chaudhary, we'll wire
the money through Dubai.'

1329
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:19,226
'And after investing it in
Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong..'

1330
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:21,231
'..we'll deposit it in
your account in Malaysia.'

1331
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:24,637
'That's fine, but when?'

1332
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:26,096
'Three days.'

1333
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:27,969
'This is when our
network comes in use.'

1334
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:31,306
'Mr. Chaudhary, with
technology comes speed.'

1335
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,580
'Great. Great.'

1336
01:24:38,153 --> 01:24:40,144
Roger was turning Raja
Chaudhary's black money white.

1337
01:24:42,157 --> 01:24:44,091
And using us to do
his jobs in return..

1338
01:24:45,327 --> 01:24:47,318
..who kill others to make a living.

1339
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:49,390
Kill others to make a living.

1340
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:52,489
And give you breaking news.

1341
01:24:53,935 --> 01:24:57,371
lf crimes and criminals disappear..

1342
01:24:57,606 --> 01:24:59,574
..half the channels will shut down.

1343
01:25:01,409 --> 01:25:02,603
lt's a sad story.

1344
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:09,747
Lord, what've you done?

1345
01:25:10,185 --> 01:25:15,088
You've burdened me with sorrows.

1346
01:25:15,423 --> 01:25:20,486
Lord, what've you done?

1347
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:26,192
You've burdened me with sorrows.

1348
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:30,327
You're the moments of
happiness in my life.

1349
01:25:31,473 --> 01:25:36,308
You're my devotion.

1350
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:41,345
Of all the times that l prayed.

1351
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:45,577
You are the answer
to all my prayers.

1352
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:51,055
l am the wave
and you're my shore.

1353
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:57,024
l am the journey and
you're my destination.

1354
01:25:57,532 --> 01:26:02,196
Of all the times that l prayed.

1355
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:07,640
You are the answer
to all my prayers.

1356
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:12,646
Lord, what've you done?

1357
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:17,714
You've burdened me with sorrows.

1358
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:23,214
Lord, what've you done?

1359
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:29,194
You've burdened me with sorrows.

1360
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:53,716
You're the beautiful
ambience in my life.

1361
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:59,991
lt's you who l crave for.

1362
01:27:00,495 --> 01:27:05,228
You've been my only desire.

1363
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,230
Stop testing me anymore.

1364
01:27:10,972 --> 01:27:15,671
You're the clouds
stirring up in my path.

1365
01:27:16,144 --> 01:27:21,081
You're like the
raindrops in a hot sun.

1366
01:27:21,449 --> 01:27:25,977
l think of you all day,
all night.

1367
01:27:26,554 --> 01:27:30,388
Don't ever go away from me.

1368
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:36,396
Lord, what've you done?

1369
01:27:36,665 --> 01:27:41,466
You've burdened me with sorrows.

1370
01:27:42,037 --> 01:27:47,065
Lord, what've you done?

1371
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:53,043
You've burdened me with sorrows.

1372
01:28:00,388 --> 01:28:02,219
Yeah. Yeah, it's beautiful.

1373
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:04,022
lt often happens.

1374
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,251
Don't worry, okay.

1375
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:06,482
Yeah.

1376
01:28:10,265 --> 01:28:12,028
Did Cujo identify the body?

1377
01:28:12,634 --> 01:28:13,623
He's on his way.

1378
01:28:13,702 --> 01:28:15,727
Two dead interns in 6 months.

1379
01:28:17,539 --> 01:28:22,238
Our story will be...
Samar's kidnapping plans backfired.

1380
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:24,544
So they killed him.

1381
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:28,642
And...the girl?

1382
01:28:29,217 --> 01:28:31,014
Let Cujo identify the body first.

1383
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:32,475
And then..

1384
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:33,952
Then just kill her.

1385
01:28:34,456 --> 01:28:35,445
And our TRP.

1386
01:28:36,024 --> 01:28:37,719
Our TRP will rocket
through the roof.

1387
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,554
Come on, now get going.

1388
01:28:57,278 --> 01:28:58,506
Cujo.
- Where is it?

1389
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:00,403
What?

1390
01:29:00,715 --> 01:29:02,478
Where's the body?
- Yeah.

1391
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,782
Take a look at the body,
on the backseat.

1392
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:10,489
You traitor.

1393
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:17,053
What?

1394
01:29:17,132 --> 01:29:18,121
Mr. Grover.

1395
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:21,530
Reporters don't look
nice holding a gun.

1396
01:29:24,706 --> 01:29:25,695
lt's real.

1397
01:29:26,374 --> 01:29:27,568
Shoot him.
- Hand it over.

1398
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:29,475
Shoot him.
- Come on.

1399
01:29:29,544 --> 01:29:31,034
l'll get you a new one on
behalf of the company for Diwali.

1400
01:29:31,112 --> 01:29:32,340
l said give it to me.

1401
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,147
Shoot him.
- You want to shoot me.

1402
01:29:34,215 --> 01:29:35,204
Shoot him.

1403
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:37,443
Don't waste my time,
Mr. Grover. Be a man.

1404
01:29:38,386 --> 01:29:40,251
Either shoot me
if you want or else..

1405
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:44,189
..you'll die squealing like a
pig just like you friend Rikin did.

1406
01:29:58,073 --> 01:29:59,062
Where is Ahana?

1407
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:01,435
Great Surya Hotel.

1408
01:30:17,225 --> 01:30:18,522
Yeah, yeah, tell him to..

1409
01:30:45,587 --> 01:30:46,576
She's dead.

1410
01:30:50,959 --> 01:30:52,358
Get out of here with her.

1411
01:30:53,294 --> 01:30:54,283
Hurry up.

1412
01:30:59,367 --> 01:31:00,493
God be with you.

1413
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:07,265
Prince, let's go.

1414
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:24,586
lt's so strange.

1415
01:31:25,693 --> 01:31:28,491
A man who always
fought for the truth..

1416
01:31:29,063 --> 01:31:30,997
..and truth meant
everything for him..

1417
01:31:32,467 --> 01:31:34,560
..was trapped by a lie.

1418
01:31:36,337 --> 01:31:39,170
Maybe because the people
are really not interested.

1419
01:31:41,109 --> 01:31:44,237
The truth is people are
running from the truth.

1420
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,747
They want to ignore the truth.

1421
01:31:48,516 --> 01:31:51,349
Because they feel
satisfied by lies.

1422
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:53,376
Ahana.

1423
01:31:53,988 --> 01:31:55,080
Listen to me, Ahana.

1424
01:31:57,225 --> 01:32:01,127
l don't
know...what's true, what's not.

1425
01:32:01,996 --> 01:32:03,623
What's right, what's wrong,
l really don't.

1426
01:32:04,432 --> 01:32:06,161
Whom to believe and whom not to.

1427
01:32:07,235 --> 01:32:12,036
Now...now l don't even..
- What will we do, Sam?

1428
01:32:13,007 --> 01:32:14,235
How will we get out of this?

1429
01:32:15,343 --> 01:32:16,605
How will we survive from this?

1430
01:32:17,312 --> 01:32:19,075
They attacked us once.

1431
01:32:19,547 --> 01:32:21,412
They'll do it again and maybe..

1432
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,082
How will you defend
against Roger Khanna?

1433
01:32:25,153 --> 01:32:26,711
You cannot do it,
even you know that.

1434
01:32:31,526 --> 01:32:33,721
You don't have any evidence either.

1435
01:32:34,295 --> 01:32:36,490
Ahana, l've a plan.

1436
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:46,131
Oh no!

1437
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:52,739
Samar.
- Surprised!

1438
01:32:54,315 --> 01:32:55,942
The tables were suddenly turned.

1439
01:32:56,751 --> 01:32:59,549
Cujo's dead. And so
are your goons-for-hire.

1440
01:33:01,289 --> 01:33:03,519
Ahana's with me and
she's looking better.

1441
01:33:03,725 --> 01:33:04,714
Samar.

1442
01:33:05,727 --> 01:33:07,752
How far can you two run,
and for how long?

1443
01:33:08,763 --> 01:33:12,199
Roger has access to every
means through which he..

1444
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:15,025
Try and understand, Samar.

1445
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:19,604
You'll never realise which
direction the bullet comes from.

1446
01:33:20,008 --> 01:33:21,600
Even l know as long
as l keep running..

1447
01:33:21,676 --> 01:33:23,507
..Roger and you will
never be at peace.

1448
01:33:24,712 --> 01:33:26,111
So let's talk like professionals.

1449
01:33:27,348 --> 01:33:29,111
Go ahead. l'm listening.

1450
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,047
l want a good retirement package.

1451
01:33:31,386 --> 01:33:32,580
A house over-looking
the sea in Bahamas..

1452
01:33:32,687 --> 01:33:33,949
..or anywhere else.

1453
01:33:34,155 --> 01:33:35,622
Then you and Roger
can go your way..

1454
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:37,116
..and l will go mine.

1455
01:33:37,392 --> 01:33:40,156
Samar. lf you had
thought this before..

1456
01:33:40,328 --> 01:33:42,296
..then we wouldn't have
gone through all this.

1457
01:33:43,398 --> 01:33:44,695
Tell me, where do we meet?

1458
01:33:45,099 --> 01:33:47,363
l want to meet Roger, and alone.

1459
01:33:48,002 --> 01:33:49,731
And if he's scared
then tell him that..

1460
01:33:50,038 --> 01:33:51,528
..fear is essential for survival.

1461
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:52,672
Okay.

1462
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,707
One more thing.

1463
01:33:53,941 --> 01:33:55,135
l was a crime reporter..

1464
01:33:55,476 --> 01:33:57,068
..but you turned
me into a criminal.

1465
01:33:57,945 --> 01:33:59,970
Now l know all the rules
of the criminal world.

1466
01:34:00,214 --> 01:34:01,511
And made a few friends..

1467
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:04,017
..who can kill anyone on
my instructions.

1468
01:34:06,254 --> 01:34:09,155
l hope you want make a mistake.

1469
01:34:21,135 --> 01:34:23,695
Dammit! Just can't get it right.

1470
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:25,229
Just can't figure out
what's wrong with my shot.

1471
01:34:25,773 --> 01:34:28,970
When one loses confidence,
then he cannot maintain a balance.

1472
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:32,972
Truth is like the knob on a radio.

1473
01:34:33,514 --> 01:34:37,575
We can manipulate
it anyway we like.

1474
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,215
You're still under
a delusion, Roger.

1475
01:34:41,356 --> 01:34:45,690
Samar. Didn't you find it
a risk coming here?

1476
01:34:47,362 --> 01:34:48,920
When a man doesn't take a risk..

1477
01:34:49,397 --> 01:34:50,728
..everything becomes risky for him.

1478
01:34:51,566 --> 01:34:52,555
Nice attitude.

1479
01:34:53,201 --> 01:34:55,294
This the last time l'm trying
to explain you.

1480
01:34:56,137 --> 01:34:59,197
Justice, values, ethics, morality..

1481
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:03,669
..they are all good for nothing.

1482
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:05,709
Only money can buy everything.

1483
01:35:06,247 --> 01:35:08,511
People are in the business of
making toothpaste..

1484
01:35:08,983 --> 01:35:11,349
..television sets, cell phones.

1485
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:15,048
And we're in the business
of making news.

1486
01:35:15,523 --> 01:35:16,683
That's the only difference.

1487
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:20,385
Those who make toothpaste and
television sets don't kill people.

1488
01:35:20,728 --> 01:35:23,196
Population needs to be controlled
for progress.

1489
01:35:23,965 --> 01:35:25,193
See it from my point of view..

1490
01:35:25,266 --> 01:35:27,166
..and everything
l am doing is right.

1491
01:35:28,002 --> 01:35:29,299
This is just the beginning.

1492
01:35:29,437 --> 01:35:30,461
And l want an end.

1493
01:35:31,239 --> 01:35:33,935
Not for you, but for my struggle.

1494
01:35:35,343 --> 01:35:36,605
Just pay me and l'll be gone.

1495
01:35:37,645 --> 01:35:39,442
My best wishes will
always be with you.

1496
01:35:39,714 --> 01:35:40,703
How much?

1497
01:35:41,082 --> 01:35:42,640
25 crores.
- 25 crores!

1498
01:35:44,652 --> 01:35:47,177
Fine. But l want the truth.

1499
01:35:47,688 --> 01:35:49,178
What will you do with the money?

1500
01:35:51,426 --> 01:35:53,018
l've already picked a house.

1501
01:35:54,095 --> 01:35:55,187
Next l'll open up my own
news channel.

1502
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:57,625
Play golf here like you.

1503
01:35:58,633 --> 01:36:00,533
And telecast the news
of 44 cities first.

1504
01:36:01,235 --> 01:36:02,167
Without committing a crime.

1505
01:36:02,236 --> 01:36:03,430
Oh really?
- Yeah.

1506
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:06,532
l wish you all the best.
- Thank you.

1507
01:36:07,575 --> 01:36:08,667
Hauskas Vilage.

1508
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:10,572
Tonight at 8.

1509
01:36:34,635 --> 01:36:35,932
Hi, Sam.
- Hi!

1510
01:36:36,237 --> 01:36:38,000
What happened to your hand?
- Nothing?

1511
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:41,902
Sit, sit.
- Will Gupta be angry?

1512
01:36:42,243 --> 01:36:43,301
What difference does it makes?

1513
01:36:43,544 --> 01:36:46,536
Ultimately what matters is..
- TRP.

1514
01:36:46,614 --> 01:36:48,013
And any channel honour
would never hate..

1515
01:36:48,082 --> 01:36:49,481
..the increase in its TRP.

1516
01:36:50,117 --> 01:36:50,674
So.

1517
01:36:50,918 --> 01:36:51,942
Get back to yourjob.

1518
01:36:52,253 --> 01:36:53,242
Let's roll.

1519
01:37:04,732 --> 01:37:05,721
Hello.

1520
01:37:06,968 --> 01:37:09,266
You must be amazed to see me here.

1521
01:37:10,938 --> 01:37:16,035
But the story that l brought for you
today will definitely shock you.

1522
01:37:16,744 --> 01:37:17,733
Make you restless.

1523
01:37:18,579 --> 01:37:20,444
lt'll be hard for you to believe
that this is possible.

1524
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:25,544
You'll be awestruck and surprised.

1525
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:28,549
l am not doing this because..

1526
01:37:28,623 --> 01:37:30,648
..that's how crime reports
are telecasted on television.

1527
01:37:31,626 --> 01:37:32,615
This is real.

1528
01:37:32,994 --> 01:37:35,087
This is a story of corporate greed.
Gluttony.

1529
01:37:35,429 --> 01:37:36,953
You won't find another example..

1530
01:37:37,031 --> 01:37:39,522
..of bloodthirsty insanity and
cruelty in the history of media.

1531
01:37:39,734 --> 01:37:41,065
This insane story can be compared..

1532
01:37:41,235 --> 01:37:44,261
..with Hiroshima,
the Jalianwala Baug incident..

1533
01:37:44,472 --> 01:37:46,337
..or the Nazi massacre.

1534
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:48,532
Yes, you can never
imagine someone..

1535
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:51,271
..could go to such limits
to make his channel no.1 .

1536
01:37:51,412 --> 01:37:53,710
That's exactly what Roger Khanna,
owner of Crime 24, did.

1537
01:37:55,249 --> 01:37:57,046
To increase his channel's TRP..

1538
01:37:57,318 --> 01:37:59,081
..to broadcast news on
his channel first..

1539
01:37:59,153 --> 01:38:00,177
..he committed murders.

1540
01:38:00,488 --> 01:38:02,217
Staged accidents, rapes.

1541
01:38:02,456 --> 01:38:04,048
Set settlements on fire,
caused riots.

1542
01:38:04,225 --> 01:38:05,783
And it did it all
with the help of..

1543
01:38:06,027 --> 01:38:07,460
..the famous Gujjar don
Raja Chaudhary.

1544
01:38:07,528 --> 01:38:09,996
And for this he paid
Raja Chaudhary millions.

1545
01:38:10,197 --> 01:38:11,596
ln return, Raja Chaudhary used..

1546
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,759
..his network of murderers
and assassins..

1547
01:38:14,001 --> 01:38:16,731
..spread all over the country
and committed heinous crimes..

1548
01:38:16,804 --> 01:38:18,999
..to make it breaking news.

1549
01:38:19,173 --> 01:38:22,165
Then Crime 24 reporters were sent
to the scene of the crime..

1550
01:38:22,243 --> 01:38:23,710
..to show this breaking news first.

1551
01:38:23,778 --> 01:38:24,802
You don't believe it, do you.

1552
01:38:25,046 --> 01:38:27,344
But that's Crime
24's hideous truth.

1553
01:38:32,053 --> 01:38:33,042
Yeah.

1554
01:38:34,455 --> 01:38:37,151
Roger. Sam isn't coming.

1555
01:38:42,697 --> 01:38:46,155
And Roger is aided by his
trusted Lisa Kapoor.

1556
01:38:48,235 --> 01:38:50,567
Crime 24's employees Shubroto
Mukherjee and Rikin Chawla..

1557
01:38:50,638 --> 01:38:52,538
..had learnt this truth.

1558
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,969
They learnt their modus operandi.

1559
01:38:55,042 --> 01:38:56,373
And so both were murdered.

1560
01:38:56,744 --> 01:38:59,406
My fianc was kidnapped so
that l stay quiet.

1561
01:38:59,714 --> 01:39:01,409
Later they planned
to kill me as well.

1562
01:39:02,984 --> 01:39:04,781
l've sent a detailed report to
the l&B ministry..

1563
01:39:05,019 --> 01:39:06,509
..Home ministry, PM and the CBl.

1564
01:39:07,054 --> 01:39:08,453
With all the facts and evidence.

1565
01:39:08,522 --> 01:39:09,716
Even about everything
that happened..

1566
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:11,121
..with my fianc Ahana Sharma.

1567
01:39:11,459 --> 01:39:13,359
Ahana gave her statement
this evening..

1568
01:39:13,427 --> 01:39:15,793
..to the special CBl team's
joint-director Mr. K.M Moorty.

1569
01:39:16,197 --> 01:39:18,358
You must be wondering that
l'm simply pressing allegations.

1570
01:39:18,532 --> 01:39:20,363
So let me show you a tape..

1571
01:39:21,035 --> 01:39:23,663
..that will expose
Roger Khanna completely.

1572
01:39:24,105 --> 01:39:27,097
People are in the business
of making toothpaste..

1573
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:29,642
..television sets, cell phones.

1574
01:39:29,744 --> 01:39:31,712
And we're in the business
of making news.

1575
01:39:32,179 --> 01:39:33,146
That's the only difference.

1576
01:39:33,214 --> 01:39:36,183
Those who make toothpaste and
television sets don't kill people.

1577
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:39,144
Are you responsible for
everyone in the world?

1578
01:39:40,087 --> 01:39:41,384
We can do anything.

1579
01:39:42,056 --> 01:39:44,718
Start a war, bring a revolution.

1580
01:39:45,326 --> 01:39:47,385
Make and break the government.

1581
01:39:47,995 --> 01:39:50,225
l've no interest in making
and breaking governments.

1582
01:39:50,598 --> 01:39:51,724
Just pay me and l'll be gone.

1583
01:39:52,566 --> 01:39:53,555
Thank you very much.

1584
01:39:54,568 --> 01:39:55,557
How much?

1585
01:39:55,736 --> 01:39:58,136
25 crores.
- 25 crores!

1586
01:39:59,106 --> 01:40:00,095
Fine. Accepted.

1587
01:40:41,649 --> 01:40:45,107
Perform and it risks all
to win freedom.

1588
01:40:52,093 --> 01:40:53,082
Speak up, rascal.

1589
01:41:12,413 --> 01:41:13,641
l've a question for you.

1590
01:41:15,182 --> 01:41:17,446
Why did Roger Khanna
choose this way..

1591
01:41:17,551 --> 01:41:18,711
..to create a sensation?

1592
01:41:20,454 --> 01:41:22,217
Because this is
what you want to see.

1593
01:41:23,457 --> 01:41:26,324
You're responsible for man like
Roger Khanna is born.

1594
01:41:27,728 --> 01:41:29,662
Every journalist today is being
taught one thing.

1595
01:41:30,064 --> 01:41:32,396
Abuse, misuse and bring us
the breaking news.

1596
01:41:33,134 --> 01:41:34,624
That's why every news channel
these days..

1597
01:41:34,935 --> 01:41:36,402
Talk like the old Sam.
- Telecast news of rape..

1598
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:37,664
..murder and extra-marital
affair all day.

1599
01:41:37,738 --> 01:41:40,206
We see people running
around covered in blood.

1600
01:41:56,757 --> 01:41:58,554
l'll be back soon.
- l'll be waiting.

1601
01:42:00,995 --> 01:42:02,656
Pardon me,
but our society, you me..

1602
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:05,665
..have started enjoying cruelty,
sex and crime.

1603
01:42:06,133 --> 01:42:07,122
They're addicted.

1604
01:42:07,301 --> 01:42:10,327
lt's sick, because it enjoys
seeing others in trouble.

1605
01:42:10,704 --> 01:42:13,366
With the notion that this can
never happen to them.

1606
01:42:14,041 --> 01:42:16,475
So we never take any interest
in news of national importance.

1607
01:42:17,978 --> 01:42:20,446
lSRO's SLV platform breaks
Putnik's record..

1608
01:42:20,714 --> 01:42:22,045
..and we don't even know.

1609
01:42:22,449 --> 01:42:24,383
Because our eyes were
on Aarushi's camera..

1610
01:42:24,518 --> 01:42:25,678
..to see what was in it.

1611
01:42:26,053 --> 01:42:28,248
Sit on your couch with a coffee
and popcorn..

1612
01:42:28,322 --> 01:42:29,721
..sensation, sexy breaking news.

1613
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:33,389
Until.. you don't become one.

1614
01:42:34,595 --> 01:42:36,290
And when you do, don't complain..

1615
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:38,188
..why the media's so insensitive.

1616
01:42:41,235 --> 01:42:43,669
This is Samar Grover.. signing off.

1617
01:42:46,273 --> 01:42:47,262
Goodnight.

1618
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:12,565
'People say every person's blessed
with two lives.'

1619
01:43:13,334 --> 01:43:14,596
'One that's given to him..

1620
01:43:15,135 --> 01:43:16,432
'..and the other which he makes
for himself.'

1621
01:43:17,037 --> 01:43:19,471
'But the one who chooses truth
in every situation..

1622
01:43:19,707 --> 01:43:21,538
'..lives life completely.'

1623
01:43:22,343 --> 01:43:23,605
'Regardless of the consequences.'

1624
01:44:08,455 --> 01:44:11,515
This obsession on my mind.

1625
01:44:11,692 --> 01:44:14,490
lt's the obsession of my Lord.

1626
01:44:14,962 --> 01:44:17,692
This intoxication that's
overpowering me.

1627
01:44:18,065 --> 01:44:20,761
lt's the obsession of my Lord.

1628
01:44:21,001 --> 01:44:23,970

lt's the obsession of my Lord.

1630
01:44:27,374 --> 01:44:30,172
This intoxication that's
overpowering me.

1631
01:44:30,377 --> 01:44:33,141
lt's the obsession of my Lord.

1632
01:44:58,305 --> 01:45:01,297
This obsession on my mind.

1633
01:45:01,575 --> 01:45:04,339
lt's the obsession of my Lord.

1634
01:45:04,478 --> 01:45:07,572
This intoxication that's
overpowering me.

1635
01:45:07,748 --> 01:45:10,649
lt's the obsession of my Lord.

1636
01:45:10,718 --> 01:45:13,710
This obsession on my mind.

1637
01:45:14,121 --> 01:45:16,988
lt's the obsession of my Lord.

1638
01:45:17,091 --> 01:45:20,083
This intoxication that's
overpowering me.

1639
01:45:20,294 --> 01:45:23,024
lt's the obsession of my Lord.
