2
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,875
Edmond Thomas Clint

3
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:19,291
The wonderful child who
enthusiastically entered

4
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:23,208
a world of lines and
colors at the age of two.

5
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:31,666
This blessed child lived
with us just for 2522 days .

6
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,791
During that period he created
around 25000 pictures.

7
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:42,458
That too, pictures that match the
works of world famous artists.

8
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:51,708
On the 15th of April 1983 , a month
short of his seventh birthday,

9
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:58,375
the genius of arts, Clint,
left us to the heavenly abode.

10
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:07,041
Clint, the prodigious child, left
us when he was just about seven..

11
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:12,291
Now it is almost thirty
four years since he left.

12
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:19,166
Being the parents of
Clint,how do you feel?

13
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:28,166
We are still living in the
memories of our soon who left

14
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:35,750
us even before he turned
seven, thirty four years ago.

15
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:45,458
We cannot live even a
moment sans his memories.

16
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:52,125
We are known as the parents of
Clint and not in our names.

17
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,000
Though we thought of him
as an ordinary child ,

18
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,875
…we recognized the extraordinary
talents he had, only

19
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,583
when people like you talk about
him in such high esteem.

20
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,416
We firmly believe that
he is still with us, not

21
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:15,208
only in our memories but
in real life as well

22
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,333
He is with us. Even now.

23
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,166
Though he had died, only
his body has disappeared

24
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,041
He is with us twenty
four hours of the day.

25
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:28,583
Whatever we do, we discuss
with him before that.

26
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,583
Even now, we strictly adhere to his
routine and do everything as per that.

27
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,708
All his belongings are
kept intact including the

28
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:41,583
twenty-five thousand
paintings that he created.

29
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,541
There is a room just
for him in our house

30
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:49,458
And in that room,we have kept
his cycle ,his pen,paint,brush,

31
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:54,791
remaining paints and brushes
and everything else he had.

32
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,458
We experience his presence here.

33
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:03,416
Some of our friends also have talked
about their feeling of his presence.

34
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:10,458
We are living with the belief that we
would meet our son someday somewhere.

35
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,791
Film director Harikumar
Sir is here.

36
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,916
Shall I open the door?

37
00:06:31,940 --> 00:07:31,940
<font color="#00ff00">Subtitles Exclusively Arranged By:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</b></font>

38
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,791
Let us go home .

39
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,083
You can draw the picture at home

40
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,625
No… Let me be here
for some more time.

41
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,583
We will go in when Papu comes.

42
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,125
Papu will get late.
It will get dark.

43
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,583
Let us go in .Come

44
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,916
The uncle who doesn’t thrash

45
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,000
The uncle who caresses

46
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,000
The uncle who is
like a lotus flower.

47
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,750
The uncle in the sky..

48
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,875
Everyone’s uncle…

49
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,750
That uncle is the full moon

50
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,833
Papu, The full moon has
the shape of a lotus ?

51
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,708
No.. Not that..Son

52
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,208
Isn’t the lotus
flower beautiful?

53
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,500
We all love it.

54
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,458
That is what is meant
in these lines

55
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,791
Three cheers to Kunjunni Mash!!

56
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,500
Now recite another poem.

57
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,000
Another one..?Oh..

58
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,750
The letter Aa is very big..

59
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,083
An elephant is also big

60
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,333
The banyan tree is very big..

61
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:47,208
And when I say ‘Aa’, the
mouth also gets very large..

62
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,750
Three cheers to Papu..!!

63
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,291
And when I say ‘Ah’ the mouth
also gets very large...

64
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,083
How large is the mouth..!

65
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,625
Papu..Get me my torch

66
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,375
Dear..Isn’t it ok to draw
after the power comes?

67
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,208
No I need to finish this now

68
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:28,583
Here..

69
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,291
Just hold it for me.

70
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,458
Why don’t you draw it later?

71
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,291
Onamma Sister,

72
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:09,625
Yes

73
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,000
When is the next dance ?

74
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,833
For your wife’s funeral..Huh!!

75
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,333
Damnit!

76
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:20,958
Is there fish in the market?

77
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,500
Yes..Go fast

78
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,083
Dear Clint..

79
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,375
Onamma is here?!

80
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,583
Now let the train
take another route

81
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:44,416
Look… I have brought a
giant sized fish for you

82
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,041
Get in.. Onamma I
will give you a lift.

83
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,458
No..No

84
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:54,916
When you grow big , buy a big
car and drive on these roads…

85
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,500
.. then you can give me a lift..

86
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,333
What sort of a fish
is this Onamma?

87
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,500
You tell me dear ..Clint

88
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,791
I don’t like your ways..Onamma

89
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,333
See… This is the
kicking choora fish

90
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,708
He has been riding this
bike in the sun since long

91
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,125
He plays only once in a while..

92
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,791
That too when these
brats are around

93
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,166
Not That …Today he
is gasping too much

94
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,000
Who will not gasp
after riding a bike?

95
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,000
Look his eyes are swollen

96
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,250
No No

97
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,375
It is over for the day.Come

98
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,666
Joseph Sir.

99
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,166
How can you be so unconcerned
about the future of your son?

100
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,958
You don’t send him to school and you
let him waste time drawing pictures!?

101
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,916
It is not that he didn’t
admit him to school

102
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:58,666
The boy left says that he is
disinterested in studies.

103
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,083
What sort of parents are you?

104
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,333
If it were our son, we would have
thrashed him to go to school

105
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,750
What Radha miss says is also
true.We too have children.

106
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,166
My children also paint
and sing quite well.

107
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,333
But M D Joseph is spending too
much on his child for his art.

108
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,541
Not a small amount
of paint and paper!!

109
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,208
Apart from that, one sided
paper from Raghavan too!!

110
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,750
That reminds me..

111
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,166
I didn’t give paper to
Joseph Sir for his son .

112
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,083
Maybe today’s quota!!

113
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,833
What use in studying in schools
and college these days??

114
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,833
No work at all..!!

115
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,083
Let him paint..

116
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,125
Who knows he might become a
Raja Ravi Varma in future.

117
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,250
He also used to draw pictures
with charcoal on walls

118
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,583
I read in a magazine recently.

119
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,750
Drop that sword down.. Papu

120
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,333
Then only it will look smashing.

121
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Show me the facial
expression Ravan had …

122
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,375
…when he knew that
his son was dead.

123
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,000
No…No.. This looks horrible..

124
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,125
Change it Papu

125
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,416
Don’t laugh. Do as I said.

126
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,583
Brilliant..Look at the
position of the sword

127
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,625
What an extraordinary
composition!!

128
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,625
I don’t k now all this, Mohan

129
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,541
Who would believe that this
is drawn by a 6 year old!?

130
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,000
Myself or Chinnama have no idea from
where he inherited this talent.

131
00:14:53,583 --> 00:15:00,041
None of our predecessors were
anywhere near drawing a picture.

132
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,666
Though you are not an
artist you are also smart.

133
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,958
Josephettan is a wrestler.

134
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,541
And also an expert
in martial arts.

135
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,500
And Chinnamma was a good
basket ball player.

136
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,583
How is related with painting?

137
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I didn’t mean that

138
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,208
Seeing his talent, I think
he was a Piccasso …

139
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,333
…or Van Gough in his
previous birth.

140
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,958
Mohan, I don’t have much
knowledge about this.

141
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:38,458
Whatever he draws you knowledgeable
people say that it is a great work

142
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:46,125
Then,Shall I admit him in some art
schools in Cochin now itself?

143
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,375
What do you say?

144
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,250
He needs no teacher.

145
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,000
His guru is himself.

146
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,666
Picasso and Mozart were
geniuses in their childhood

147
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,166
But they had good background.

148
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,875
Mozart’s father was a musician.

149
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,291
And Picasso’s father
was a painter too.

150
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:13,041
But our Clint who has no such inheritance,
was born with God’s own fingers.

151
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,791
Just as I entered, I got
the title of my article.

152
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,333
An artist born out of
the murmurs of nature.

153
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,416
Come in

154
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,666
Sir

155
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,791
Please sit down

156
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:31,958
Sir

157
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,083
Greetings

158
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,000

Is from Bombay

160
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,833
Crap ….

161
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,833
He is here on a request from
Janardanan Sir of the Indian Express

162
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,916
To write about his pictures

163
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,500
Bring those pictures

164
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,083
fantastic

165
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,166
Can I bring something to drink?

166
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,583
Not now..Let it get dark

167
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,041
No Sir..Tea or coffee?

168
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,750
I don’t drink tea or coffee

169
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,458
I can have a glass of
chilled ..water..I mean?

170
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,000
These are pictures
drawn our son.

171
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,083
Why?

172
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,458
No..Sir have a look

173
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,375

to improve a lot

177
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:05,041
I don’t see the
composition of Picasso …

178
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,458
…or the surrealism
of Dali in these.

179
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,750
My dear boy!!

180
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,416
Why don’t you try cubism?

181
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,000
Papu

182
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,625
I will write about you.
I will boost you up.

183
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,041
Mr Janardanan told
me in particular

184
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,625
Son

185
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,250
Now your future is
on my fingertips.

186
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,083
Papu Just take me up

187
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:30,958
Should I..Dear?

188
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,708
Yes You should

189
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,000
Come near

190
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,000
I said you come near

191
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,208
Son..Why should you?

192
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,333
Take me to him

193
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,541
No I will come there

194
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,166
Bring me your ears..

195
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,125
*&%$@+!

196
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,833
Don’t bring such
nonsense to me again..

197
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,083
I will drop you

198
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,416
Wait Sir

199
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,916
No..No..No

200
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:03,875
Sir

201
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,708
I can go myself

202
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,791
Look Who all have come!

203
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,958
Nair sir has been on tour with
family for quite some days!!

204
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,541
Lakshmi, Ammu

205
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:44,041
Come.. Viji, Let us hear
Trivandrum news from you.

206
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:49,625
My dear Chinnamma..The kids wanted
to go on a tour on vacation

207
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,708
They were so insistent. And then
we decided to go to Trivandrum

208
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,791
Isn’t Chandrika staying there?

209
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,875
And she has been inviting
us since many days..

210
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,208
Sit down I will take tea.

211
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,208
No.. we just had

212
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:57,708
Sit

213
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,625
I heard you income tax sleuths caught
a moneybag for hoarding black money.

214
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,583
Not just one or two lakhs .. Fresh
currency notes for twenty five lakhs!

215
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,625
How many pictures
have you drawn!!

216
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,125
You drew this bird just now?

217
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,208
Ammu.. See he draws
with his left hand!

218
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,083
Sometimes he draws
with his left hand

219
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,250
How can anyone draw so
beautifully with left hand?

220
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,625
Lakshmi, Ammu Come
Let us have tea

221
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,625
Come Ammu

222
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,083
I will come later.

223
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,000
How many pictures you
drew after I left?

224
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,625
A thousand ones !!

225
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,250
I won’t ask you again

226
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,208
How long since you left?

227
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,416
How many days?

228
00:21:55,791 --> 00:22:01,083
Monday ,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,
Friday and today is Saturday.

229
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,583
We had to see a lot of places.
Didnt feel like coming back

230
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,208
Daddy said his leave got over..
and he didn’t want to stay

231
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,166
Then you could have stayed there.
Why did you come here?

232
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,041
To see you….

233
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,291
When we went to the zoo..you
know what did we see!!

234
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,833
A tiger nursing its child

235
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:38,125
Then a leopard was carrying
its baby in the mouth

236
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:44,416
Then we saw a bear, zebra and
a rabbit who eats a carrot

237
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,625
Then a Giraffe too

238
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,333
Giraffe? What is that?

239
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,333
A long neck,a head
like that of a deer.

240
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,333
Small ears. A belly
like that of a cow.

241
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,750
Long legs and large
spots all over the body

242
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:29,958
What happened??

243
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,458
Ammu is an innocent
girl..Isn’t it Mummy

244
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,125
She was innocent earlier also.
Why do you ask now?

245
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,375
Yes.She was and is even now

246
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,208
Come ..We can go in and sleep

247
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,666
Mummy Can you sing me a song?

248
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:46,833
Song?

249
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,875
The song that you always sing..

250
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,041
Yes..I want to sleep
hearing that song

251
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,166
Come

252
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,291
In the rhythm of
a waves ensemble

253
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,208
And that of an ‘onam’ song

254
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Beautiful butterfly...

255
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,541
Whom are you searching for….
In the breeze,everyday?

256
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,791
In the rhythm of
a waves ensemble

257
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,708
And that of an ‘onam’ song

258
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Beautiful butterfly...

259
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,041
Whom are you searching for….
In the breeze,everyday?

260
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,916
Near and far

261
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,625
And along the shores
of rain clouds

262
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,083
You will reach

263
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,791
I too am coming with you

264
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,416
As you mix colors

265
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,083
The sky turns into
a flower garden

266
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,708
And as you go in search of honey

267
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,250
Even a teak turns
into a ‘honey’ tree

268
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:16,000
The joyous smile that
you extend to me

269
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,666
Remains in me as cool
and affectionate love

270
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:44,583
In search of an altar
figure on top of some hill

271
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:50,000
In search of a nice world
on every piece of cloud

272
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:55,166
To sing and dance in the breeze

273
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,333
Won’t you come with
me, my darling?

274
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:05,583
To ride the chariot
of a light breeze

275
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:10,416
Won’t you come as beautiful
as a tender breeze?

276
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:13,416
Who are you?

277
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,916
Are you life itself?

278
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,083
Did the the
mist,sunshine and rain

279
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,333
Come along with you?

280
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,833
Did they come along with you?

281
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,666
With beautiful colors

282
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,791
You created shapes everywhere

283
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,125
And added expressions to them..

284
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,958
Like some hope, like
some beautiful dream

285
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,708
You appear in every birth

286
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,416
As warmth in my heart

287
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:06,041
Didn’t you see…. in every wave?

288
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:10,916
Bright white clouds
dancing in a rhythm?

289
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:16,125
To see the countryside
where white lilies bloom

290
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:20,958
Won’t you come, like
small little waves?

291
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,875
Please come, my dear

292
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,208
You are my soul

293
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,000
Like the ultimate truth

294
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:34,291
That guards my dreams
and my thoughts

295
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,916
In the rhythm of
a waves ensemble

296
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,750
In the rhythm of an ‘onam’ song

297
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,083
Beautiful butterfly...

298
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,208
Whom are you searching for….
In the breeze,everyday?

299
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,208
Look… The picture of a leopard
feeding its cub.Look..

300
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,916
Here a rat eats a carrot.

301
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,833
A tiger carrying
its cub by mouth…

302
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,791
How are they?

303
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,041
There are still more..

304
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,083
Giraffe,

305
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:05,875
Zebra,

306
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,375
Hippoptamus,

307
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,000
Look

308
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:15,750
He finished these last night
without a wink of sleep

309
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,958
Mohan You know that he has
not seen any of these.

310
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:26,541
Nair Sir’s daughter Ammu told him in
detail about what she saw in the zoo.

311
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,000
I am not at all
surprised at this.

312
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:35,208
M.V.Devan Mash recently said that the
works of this 6 year old are as good as …

313
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:41,041
…the works of any world
famous 60 year old artists.

314
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:45,791
If you ask me, if all parents
are like this, I don’t know

315
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:51,375
But myself and my son’s mummy
think that it is our duty .

316
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:56,666
We know that some relatives and
friends are laughing at us.

317
00:28:57,041 --> 00:29:00,291
But we never reject
any of his demands.

318
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:04,875
All these are being done with the
salary of a govt.UD Clerk. That is all

319
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,375
Come what may, you should
take the Delhi trip

320
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:13,083
Getting an entry into the Sankar’s International
competition is in itself a great recognition.

321
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:19,458
But the plane fare for three to
Delhi is a huge amount.Is it?

322
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,708
I have applied for a PF loan.

323
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,041
Might get it sanctioned
in a couple of days.

324
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,166
Is the competition on the 23rd?

325
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,833
So shall we reach
there on the 22nd?

326
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:30,666
Yes.

327
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:36,166
From my limited knowledge
of art, I am telling you,

328
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:46,000
…only a genius can draw pictures like
what he creates with lines and colors.

329
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:51,708
If there is a word that describes something
beyond wonder…that is what he is..

330
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,583
Tomorrow, you are going to be
well known as Clint’s parents.

331
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,166
Clint.. Dear

332
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:22,958
Ouch!

333
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,583
- Son!!
- Oh..It didn’t occur to me.

334
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:27,375
He doesn’t like anyone
touching his hair.

335
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,250
Are they not Christians?

336
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,750
Oh..They don’t care

337
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,541
They go to temples
and churches too

338
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,333
Your art is flourishing, Right?

339
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:07,916
You will become great..you
have to become great..

340
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,750
Has not been seeing
him since some days?

341
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:13,000
He does what he feels
like everyday.

342
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,666
Today he insisted to
go to the temple.

343
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,416
That is his style!!

344
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:22,666
When would the
elephant come again?

345
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,500
It will come.We will bring it.

346
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:27,791
Didn’t you pray in front of
your favorite God.Ganpathi?

347
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,791
Have you been to Thrissur
pooram, Thirumeni uncle?

348
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,125
Of course!!That is enchanting .

349
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,166
The elephants procession at the southern exit
and the exchange of decorated umbrellas!!

350
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,166
What a sight to watch!!

351
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,166
Then …the fireweroks at dawn.

352
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,041
Shining umbrellas rain down
from sky during the fireworks.

353
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,291
Are you going to
the next pooram?

354
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,708
Maummy What did you pray?

355
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,500
For everyone’s welfare

356
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,875
Everyone means?

357
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:04,750
For Manjumala Granpa,
grandma,Alice aunt.

358
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,291
Then our Ammu and Gundamani..?!

359
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,125
Yes..For the welfare of
every human being on earth.

360
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:16,166
Who would pray for the birds,
squirrels, cats, tigers and elephants?

361
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:21,791
Who would pray for these
trees,rivers and mountains?

362
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:34,833
Mummy said if we prayed, everything
would happen as we wished.

363
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:35,791
Is it right Papu?

364
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:39,291
Of course. If you pray
wholeheartedly..it will happen

365
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Why did you ask?

366
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,958
Today I prayed in temple.

367
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,916
What did you pray for?

368
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,291
I prayed that I get a
trunk like Ganapathy.

369
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,625
Trunk? Why do you need one?

370
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,833
For mixing these paints
and do the painiting,

371
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,666
…two hands are not
enough for me..Papau

372
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,833
If I had a trunk too…!!

373
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:03,750
Your idea is good.Did you
pray for anything else?

374
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,833
Yes.For you to quit
drinking brandy.

375
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,875
Who told you that
I drink brandy?

376
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,958
I have seen you drinking
with Mohan uncle.

377
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,958
Oh..That is just soda… Dear

378
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,916
Yes…Soda mixed with brandy.

379
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:25,000
Mummy said nowadays you are
drinking too much soda.

380
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:28,125
Isn’t it bad for your health?
Papu

381
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,500
Only once in a while ,Dear.

382
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,541
Do Gods drink brandy?

383
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,875
Does God drink brandy?

384
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,916
Maybe Ganapathy drinks beer.

385
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:41,333
And that is why he
has a large belly.

386
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,208
Look

387
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,791
Ganapthy drinking
beer..That is good.

388
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:59,041
O. V .Vijayan once told me in
Delhi.I didn’t take it seriously.

389
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,541
When I went to M Govindan in
Chennai, Aravindan was there.

390
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,041
The film director.

391
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:11,625
Aravindan also told me about this 6 year
boy’s magic fingers and the talent he holds.

392
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:16,958
When both of them told
me,I felt like meeting him

393
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,541
It was Govindan who told me to postpone
the Delhi trip and come to Cochin.

394
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,416
I called Kaladharan.

395
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:28,041
If there is such a rare genius in our
home he should be known to the world.

396
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:34,291
When he was just 6 months old, lying prone,he
drew a perfect circle with charcoal.

397
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,000
That was his beginning.

398
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,416
And when he was about two years old
he started drawing pictures on walls.

399
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,500
After that, he
hasn’t looked back

400
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,500
Look at the vigor in the eyes
of that elephant in the centre.

401
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:52,458
Can’t believe that it is
drawn by a 6 year old.!!

402
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:57,625
Did you say, Mohan, that someone remarked
these are not drawn by a 6 year old..

403
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,916
…but by some great artist.

404
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:04,250
Can’t blame him for that.Anyone could
remark that after seeing these.

405
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:10,375
Where is our hero.. you
said he is taking a bath.

406
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:12,000
I will call him

407
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,750
He has a lot of talents
that would surprise us.

408
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,875
He has extraordinary
grasping power.

409
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:21,458
Excellent memory.He has
to see a thing only once…

410
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:34,291
That means he has photographic memory
which only one in a million has.

411
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:38,375
How nicely he has drawn
whales and owls!!

412
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,666
Greetings

413
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,291
Dude..I am V.K.Nambiar

414
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:52,291
I write on art in
Illustrated weekly.

415
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:57,000
I came from Delhi just to
meet you and see your works.

416
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,083
I saw them.And I have
given my opinions to them

417
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:05,041
Can you draw a portrait for me?

418
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:05,916
Whose?

419
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,291
Mine

420
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:11,208
Or that of my alter
image..a donkey

421
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:17,083
Papu, Get me my
drawing materials.

422
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,333
Mohan..This wine was prepared
by my son’s papu at home

423
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:44,791
I just prepared it .But the preparations
were done by my son’s mummy.

424
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:48,375
So if it is good, the credit
goes to my son’s mummy.

425
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,750
They call each other like that.

426
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,833
Son’s papu and son’s mummy..

427
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,750
They share the credits
for everything

428
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:59,458
Joseph is really smart.

429
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:02,750
He has learned martial arts
and also a good wrestler.

430
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:06,166
He has beaten a champion
wrestler long tome back.

431
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,125
Who was that?

432
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,916
Manakkat Jamal

433
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:13,000
He also reads a lot of books
in Malayalam and English.

434
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,750
And he talks about
them to his son

435
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,250
He also reads a lot

436
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:21,291
Seeing a lot of movies, he became a fan
of Clint Eastwood and named his son Clint

437
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,583
Amazing.

438
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:39,416
I told him just to draw
the picture of a donkey.

439
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:44,125
When he finished it,how
many layers it has!!

440
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,083
That too in minutes!!

441
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:54,666
A donkey carrying heavy load,the pain
it goes through,and the teardrops,

442
00:37:55,208 --> 00:38:00,625
The emotions on the donkey’s face .
Imagination of a 6 year old !!

443
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:03,291
The finesse of the lines!!

444
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:07,916
From where does he get
this imaginations!!?

445
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,625
Ideas…

446
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:15,083
When he grows up to the age
of Picasso, Gough or Brock .

447
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:17,750
…what sort of wonders he
would create in his art!!

448
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,125
Not only in painting,
Nambiar Sir,

449
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:24,916
His observations,
thoughts,visions are all deep.

450
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,333
The depth of his
knowledge is amazing.

451
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,500
That is some
extraordinary phenomenon

452
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,125
Beyond explanation!

453
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:37,875
Haven’t you heard Mohan Only one in a
billion can be born this prodigious.

454
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,708
Just think that his is
such a miraculous birth!!

455
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:46,416
And don’t try to give
it an explanation!!

456
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,333
They phoned your father
was on deathbed.

457
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,458
Here he is…smartly
reading newspaper

458
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,833
Dad… What did you do?

459
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,125
Why did you call him up at office
and asked us to come immediately?

460
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:02,541
Grandpa

461
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,458
Did you think that I
was about to die?

462
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,458
Grandpa

463
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,166
I wanted to meet my
darling grandson..

464
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,166
Thought you might come once
the school closes on vacation

465
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,333
He does not go to school..Then
what vacation he has?

466
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,000
I forgot that .

467
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,250
His hair has grown too long.

468
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:24,250
Didn’t I tell you to get it
cut even when you came last?

469
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,083
Not only last time, but every
time we come, you repeat this

470
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,041
Then did you obey me?

471
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:31,208
He also has to agree, Dad

472
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,416
I just trim it when he sleeps

473
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,958
And then he wakes up he makes
a hell of a lot of noise..

474
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,708
..talking about
Samson from the Bible

475
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,750
Is it? What happened to Samson?

476
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,375
This fellow does
not know anything

477
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,083
What was that?

478
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:50,041
Dad..It is about Samson the
son of Manoah from Israel.

479
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:53,208
He had all his power
hidden in his hair..

480
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,625
His enemies cut off his
hair to defeat him

481
00:39:56,791 --> 00:40:00,166
Oh..Is it? Then I will
tell you something

482
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:01,166
What is that?

483
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:05,208
If you don’t cut your by
the time you come next,

484
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:09,166
…I will do a magic and
make your hair disappear!!

485
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,791
How easy!!

486
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,958
Clint..Dear

487
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,083
Did you get the first bus itself..
Dear?

488
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,291
How can we not get that bus?

489
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,083
He got us into a scare..!!

490
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,666
Why is there a swelling
under his eyes?

491
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:26,458
Oh Nothing. He paints
without getting a wink

492
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,833
Clint Dear

493
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,916
Alice Sis.. Can you

00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:31,875
Sure..Let us go

495
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,375
He has been asking for
this from home itself

496
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,041
Where is Antony uncle?

497
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,083
Mister Cochin..!

498
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,625
Antony uncle

499
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:09,583
When did you come Dude?

500
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:10,875
Just a while ago

501
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:11,833
Who else are there?

502
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,666
Papu ,myself and mummy.

503
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,208
Heard you got some prize.

504
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:19,375
And your pictures were in
newspapers..Alice told me

505
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:28,458
God permits, I will
get a prize too..

506
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,666
Mr Cochin

507
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:34,041
Why can’t I lift this Uncle?

508
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,083
You have to grow a
bit more for that

509
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,666
Uncle, Isn’t it heavy?

510
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,375
Look..It is steel..
just touch and see

511
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:47,458
Look

512
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,333
Is this Mr Cochin?

513
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,250
Why are you laughing?

514
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:56,333
Nothing

515
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,000
Are you a great artist?!!

516
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,875
By the time I come, draw some
pictures in the front yard.

517
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:00,666
Should I?

518
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:01,833
Yes..Do that

519
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,500
I am not in a mood

520
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,375
So many drawings!!

521
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:26,833
He is smart indeed!!

522
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:41,583
Anyway,we were planning
to come here .

523
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,666
May 19th is Clint’s
sixth birthday.

524
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:47,041
He wants to celebrate
it this time

525
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,333
We also thought so

526
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,333
Ok..We will reach there a
couple of days before.

527
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:53,583
Are you having a lot of
guests for the function?

528
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:57,083
Yes..Our neighbors and
those close to us.

529
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,250
Joseph, Call your relatives too.

530
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,541
Let them forget the old rivalry.

531
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,041
That won’t go

532
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:13,416
For whom is this heap
of eggs,Alice Aunt?

533
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:14,541
For Antony Uncle

534
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,791
Mr.Cochin

535
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,833
Will you pass the tenth
at least this time,Kid?

536
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,208
All those studied with her in the
tenth completed degree courses.

537
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,208
I will pass

538
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,583

539
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,833
Yes..She will get
glass tumbler..Is it?

540
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,500
What do you plan
to do after that?

541
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,083
I will go to the college..

542
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,708
To flunk there too!! Is it?

543
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,250
Joseph..If there are some smart
boys around we can get her married

544
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,916
I don’t want to marry

545
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,458
Whose marriage are
you talking about?

546
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:41,958
About you

547
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,333
I have told them so many times
that I don’t wish to marry now.

548
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,208
Only after I become Mr.Cochin

549
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,208
Are you on a bet?

550
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:50,875
Maybe..

551
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:54,000
In that case, it will be difficult
for you to get married!!

552
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:56,791
Don’t talk loud things
with a small mouth,Dude

553
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,916
Then shall I talk small
things with a loud mouth.

554
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,083
Do you understand what I say?

555
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:23,250
Have you understood well?

556
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,750
Then show me

557
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,208
Here… I am going to do

558
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:48,041

something else

560
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,458
Look well

561
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,541
There is nothing..sure?

562
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,041
Now.. Look

563
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:16,583

564
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:48,250
Aunty, From where did
Clint learn magic?

565
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,916
He said he knows lot of magic.

566
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:53,083
The disappearance
trick and all that!?

567
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,666
Ah..He learned it somehow

568
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,750
That is all a lie

569
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,500
What did you say?

570
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:58,500
It is a lie?

571
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:01,125
Then ..shall I make you
a stick with my magic?

572
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:02,666
What does that mean?!

573
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,291
I will turn you nude..

574
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:05,416

Tomorrow I will take you
to an interesting show

580
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,083
Where Papu?

581
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,208
You said you wanted
to watch Kathakali

582
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:47,583
Where is it?

583
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,333
In Ernakulam Kathakali club

584
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,791
What is the story Papu?

585
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:53,916
Keechakavadham.

586
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:57,166
Haven’t I told you Keechaka’s
story from Mahabharath

587
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:59,958
The story of Bhima
killing Keechaka..

588
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,375
The Keechakavdham
Kathakali Performance

589
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:10,833
What sort of a dance is this?

590
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:12,041
Kathakali.

591
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,583
He just watched it only once

592
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:18,583
I too danced something like
this when I was young.

593
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,083
The Margam Kali

594
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,375
Those days I was not like this.

595
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,666
I was a beautiful lass..Look

596
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:33,166
With cheeks like ripe tomatoes and
eyes like tender lotus petals

597
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:39,500
Everyone used to appreciate my
beauty… boys and girls alike.

598
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,083
Even now you look
beautiful Onamma sister

599
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:45,250
Now I have got old now…

600
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,916
He is the hero I
was talking about.

601
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,791
When he was just three he
made us wonderstruck ….

602
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,625
…as he stood up on a stool and
drew pictures on the blackboard.

603
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:02,458
Why did he discontinue studies?

604
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,583
Sister Long time no see

605
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:08,583
Chinnamma School is closed.

606
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:12,250
And I was running around with
some matters of the convent.

607
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,833
This is the new sister.
Sr Rossilin

608
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,750

609
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:18,625
We just came in to see him.

610
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:20,416
It has been long since I met him

611
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,000
We were about to come
there to invite you.

612
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,500
Now you can do that, Son

613
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:26,541
My birthday is on the
19th of May Sister.

614
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,000
We are celebrating it this time.

615
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:55,000
This is a landscape
that I do in oil color.

616
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,375
This is the earth,this is sky.

617
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:00,375
We need a mixing here.

618
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,666
Ask me in case you
have any doubts

619
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,250

Isn’t it the first event after
Nambudiri mash left Mathrubhumi.?

623
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,458
We have to make it grand..

624
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:49,333
His copper reliefs exhibition would
be for the first time, Is it?

625
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,583
When is the meeting?

626

I will be there.

627
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:00,708
Devan Mash would also
be there ..Is it?

Give him this glass of horlicks

631
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:15,375
There is going to be an exhibition of
Nambudiri’s copper reliefs in Kalapitham

632
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:17,666
Copper relif? What is that?

633
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:21,500
His sculptures on copper plates.

634
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:25,708
Did he join any other
periodical after Mathrubhumi?

635
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:28,125
Heard that he is going
to join Kalkaumudi.

636
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:30,916
You do have God’s own
fingers.God’s own!!!

637
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,708
You made me wonderstruck.Dear

638
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:38,916
The dark birds flying in the sky,the
kingfisher on the tree branch

639
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:43,250
The boat..All these
never crossed my mind

640
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,833
Who can predict… who will
you be when you grow up!!

I don’t want to
become any of them

643
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,083
I want to be like
you… Mohan uncle.

644
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:22,291
Why do you mix different colors?

645
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:23,708
To create a new color

646
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:25,666
Then ,won’t there
be a lot of colors?

647
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,791
Yes

648
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,583
How many?

649
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,875
As many as one wants

650
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,416
Who taught you all these?

651
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,208
Nobody taught me

652
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:35,125
Nobody taught me also.

653
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:37,333
But I don’t know all these.

654
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,083
I will teach you

655
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:48,291

01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:21,208
Let us grab the moon’s disc and
turn it into a bronze gong

709
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,416
Turn it into a bronze gong

710
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:30,208
Let us topple the casket
into the bright sky

711
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,208
Let us topple..

712
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,666
Let us wander around in
the celebration of colors

713
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:47,083
When the stars,the
red stars, blink

714
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:51,666
When the festival lights,the
golden festival lights, are on

715
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:17,625
When the stars,the
red stars, blink

716
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:22,208
When the festival lights,the
golden festival lights, are on

717
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:26,666
Let us accompany the
dark rain clouds

718
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:31,083
And circle the earth in the
golden moon’s chariot…

719
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:35,541
A globe ,another globe
,unlike the earth

720
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:40,500
A festival ,a grand one,
unlike the usual one

721
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:46,125
When the stars,the
red stars, blink

722
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:50,041
When the festival lights,the
golden festival lights, are on

723
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,666
When the stars,the
red stars, blink

724
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:57,291
When the festival lights,the
golden festival lights, are on

725
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,458
My dear son!!!

726
01:02:11,482 --> 01:03:26,482
<font color="#00ff00">Subtitles Exclusively Arranged By:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</b></font>

727
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,458
Mummy

728
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,458
Divya… He opened his eyes.

729
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:27,291
Where are we,Mummy?

730
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,041
I will inform the senior

731
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:29,791
Ok

732
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:33,125
We…We are in a hospital

733
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:37,250
Mummy ,Where are my
pencils and crayons?

734
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,166
Aren’t we here now? I will
get it brought from home

735
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:43,166
I want to draw right now.

736
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:50,416
I want to draw the prince on
a horse flying in the sky.

737
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:16,083
Chronic tubular nephritis

738
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,875
A disease that
damages the kidneys.

739
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:25,083
This can appear at any age.

740
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:28,708
It can also appear as a side effect
of some medicine that one took.

741
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,333
But this..

742
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:35,166
Dr..When he was three, three and a half
years he used to get some illnesses

743
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:39,125
Had given some medicines also

744
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:43,833
Joseph, His present condition
is a bit critical.

745
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:46,541
Both kidneys are almost damaged

746
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,750
I mean..You are a
little bit late

747
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:54,583
I might be able to console you
saying there is nothing to worry.

748
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:56,875
But you are educated people.
We can try

749
01:05:57,708 --> 01:06:01,458
Let him be in the
hospital for some days.

750
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,583
All the three of them are
preparing to go to Delhi.

751
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,625
He has to participate in the Sankar
International Painting competition

752
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:32,458
Don’t lose courage Joseph.

753
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:40,041
Dr Joseph Abraham is one of the
best nephrologists in Kerala.

754
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,583
We are quite close since
a couple of years.

755
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,291
Still..

756
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:51,416
Shall we consult another doctor in the
Medical College? Just for a second opinion.

757
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:56,916
Why don’t you talk Joseph?

758
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:03,125
I trust Dr Joseph

759
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:34,833
Joseph, Don’t reveal
these details to anyone.

760
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:36,708
Not even to Chinnamma

761
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:45,041
Look....David beats
Goliyath with a big stone..

762
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:46,958
You know what Goliyath does?

763
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:53,208
Oh..Papu is here.I
want to go home.

764
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:55,000
And I want to draw.

765
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,458
You have become smart

766
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,541
Mohan uncle..When are
we going to Delhi?

767
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,083
Still a lot of time
left for that.

768
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,583
Let us see what you are reading

769
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:13,541
What happened Papu? What
did the doctor say?

770
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:16,166
Not much of a problem..

771
01:08:16,666 --> 01:08:18,333
Can go within two days.

772
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,375
This 6 year old is not a small
fish.He is a well-known artist.

773
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:34,083
There was an article on him in
the Hindu about two weeks back.

774
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,083
Really?

775
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:38,708
You will be surprised to know how many
pictures he has made even at this age?

776
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:41,458
Not just five hundred
or thousand.

777
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,083
How many, Joseph?

778
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,208
He must have done around twenty
five thousand paintings.

779
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,500
Oh..I see ..Come, Let me see

780
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:10,750
It is long since he
had a haircut Is it?.

781
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,500
William uncle

782
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:17,916
Me?

783
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,166
Did you name me William uncle?

784
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:23,166
William uncle ..When
will we go home?

785
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:26,750
You can go..Why so much hurry?

786
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:29,291
Myself and Papu are
going to Delhi

787
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:30,125
Oh..

788
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,000
William uncle, Have you
travelled in a plane?

789
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:33,750
Sure

790
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,750
Won’t we get afraid
flying so high?

791
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:38,625
No..No

792
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:43,250
I will sit in the middle.Papu
and mummy on both my sides.

793
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,250
Ok..Why are you
going to Delhi now?

794
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,916
To participate in a competition

795
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:02,291
He is very excited
on his Delhi trip!

796
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:07,666
The ticket was for today.The
competition is on day after tomorrow

797
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,750
He is excited over that

798
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,083
Joseph..Cool down

799
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:22,958
William uncle,

800
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:27,416
Why Papu is so depressed
and sits in a corner?

801
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:30,875
When I was coming here I saw him
sitting there on the bench outside ..

802
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:32,958
With his chin
covered with palms.

803
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,250
Like this

804
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:39,125
You smart boy..!!

805
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,083
When did you draw this?

806
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:41,125
Just now

807
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:44,125
Then you draw a picture of mine.

808
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:54,458
For that, you don’t have to sit with muscles
tigh, like posing for a photograph.

809
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:58,000
Anyway, I am not in a mood
to draw your picture now.

810
01:10:58,416 --> 01:11:00,541
When I get into a mood,
I will draw it for you.

811
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:04,041
I am a bit busy.You can go
and sit in the sisters’ room

812
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:07,750
Oh..No That girl knows nothing

813
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,583
I will sit here

814
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:18,291
Did the doctor talk
about discharge?

815
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,958
He said we can leave
in a couple of days.

816
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:26,916
Even after that, we
have to be careful.

817
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:28,916
Clint is not the
old Clint anymore.

818
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,625
Papu..Look

819
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,833
I want to show this
to William uncle.

820
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:41,500
Have to discuss something.

821
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:43,875
Son..He must have gone home

822
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,750
Then we will go to his home

823
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:50,208
No..No it is already late
.We will go tomorrow

824
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:52,375
You drink this now

825
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,166
Where is William uncle?

826
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,250
William uncle?

827
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,083
Doctor is not here Son.He
is in the board meeting

828
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:22,083
Patients should not
walk around like this.

829
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,333
Go to your room

830
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:32,166
Sister ,Where is the
doctors’ meeting?

831
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:33,500
In the Board Room downstairs

832
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,791
Sir..He didn’t listen to
me.He just crashed in

833
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,875
William uncle

834
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:05,125
You know I was in search
of you everywhere.

835
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:06,750
Come..

836
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:08,625
My celebrity patient

837
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:12,166
Edmund Thomas Clint…The
prince of colors.

838
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,666
Uncle, I need to discuss
something with you.

839
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:20,541
Uncle is in a meeting now.You
can go.We can talk later

840
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:24,916
Go..take your paper

841
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,500
A rare phenomenon.

842
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:36,125
Haven’t you heard
of child prodigies?

843
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,916
He is only 6 years old.

844
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:43,375
And at this age the coverage he
has got on the national media!!

845
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:44,666
The recognitions
he has achieved!!

846
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:47,041
First prize in all the competitions
that he participated!!

847
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:48,625
What is his problem?

848
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:51,708
He is critical

849
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:54,916
Ok What is this ?

850
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:58,166
Kidney. Good

851
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:01,458
Brain.

852
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,291
Skeleton

853
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:12,166
William uncle..What
do you mean by mind?

854
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:15,250
How does the mind look like?

855
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,291
Where is it in our body?

856
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,333
What is its shape and color?

857
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,125
I want to draw.

858
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,916
It has no particular shape.

859
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,916
It is not an organ too

860
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:29,041
That ..er..What should I say?!

861
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:35,833
But people talk of cruel mind, mind that
cannot be seen and feeling in the mind

862
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:39,125
That is why I said it
is just a feeling.

863
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,875
What is a feeling?

864
01:14:41,916 --> 01:14:43,166
Feeling means…er..

865
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:44,083
Tell me

866
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,250
That ..er..feeling is

867
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:48,833
What can I say?

868
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:58,458
William uncle

869
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:01,666
Why do dogs lift their
legs when they urinate?

870
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,291
That..Er..

871
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,500
See..We are not like that..

872
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:10,333
No..That …er..

873
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,666
William uncle..If you don’t
know, tell me you don’t know.

874
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,375
Don’t start beating
around the bush..

875
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:17,916
I don’t like that

876
01:15:28,416 --> 01:15:29,625
William uncle

877
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:31,250
Where did we come from?

878
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:33,625
We means?

879
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:35,833
Myself and you and everyone else

880
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:39,041
We are all God’s creations

881
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:45,125
It is said in Bible that God created man
from mud and seeing his loneliness…

882
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,541
And on the 6th day, He created
female out of man’s rib.

883
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,916
William uncle..I am asking
you out of my ignorance.

884
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:53,666
Why did you take MBBS and MRCP?

885
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:55,166
Why?

886
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,125
Why?

887
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:09,416
William uncle ..Where
are we going?

888
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,041
Just for a drive.

889
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,875
Don’t you have to remove
this bush from your head?

890
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:15,416
Mr Edmond Thomas Clint?

891
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:19,166
What I want to say is that the
present fashion trend is …

892
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,500
Stop the car.

893
01:16:20,916 --> 01:16:22,250
Let me tell you

894
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:23,791
Stop

895
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,500
William uncle ..I told
you to stop the car

896
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:44,750
I am permitting the discharge
only because you insisted.

897
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:49,250
Do understand that he would
look ok from outside.

898
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:52,333
But his immunity is very poor.

899
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:56,166
Even common cold …It
may affect him.

900
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:03,333
Then, I told you We have to cut his
hair..even if he may not like it.

901
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:06,875
No Doctor.. He won’t
let us do that

902
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,250
We have tried many times

903
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:13,041
We will have to do some things
even if he does not like.

904
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:20,458
Anyway,in this situation, it is better
to shave off his hair completely

905
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:23,375
We will have to use force..

906
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:26,500
That will weaken him

907
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:31,083
Don’t we want his
disease to be cured?

908
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,666
Why are you here?

909
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:17,541
Mummy, Why people
keep birds in cages?

910
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:19,458
Don’t they have to fly around?

911
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:21,625
Didn’t you want us to
bring this parrot?

912
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,875
Don’t you want to draw?

913
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:38,041
Call Sister

914
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:40,625
Chinnamma sister

915
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:42,291
I am coming

916
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,958
Everyone get ready fast.We
have to go home at Manjummal

917
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:49,958
What happened?

918
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:50,625
I will tell you

919
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:51,208
Where is Clint?

920
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:52,000
He is there

921
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:52,833
Get him ready

922
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:17,166
It has turned dark.

923
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:19,291
Let us go

924
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:24,083
How can we go leaving
grandpa all alone?

925
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:34,666
Papu..Where will
we go after death?

926
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:41,458
To somewhere far
off..beyond the skies

927
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:46,291
So..Grandpa must have already
reached there ..Is it?

928
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,125
Let us go

929
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:28,833
After dad’s death,
he changed a lot

930
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,875
This the first time
he is seeing death.

931
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:41,708
Now, all his doubts and
questions are on death.

932
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:49,666
I am really afraid Mohan

933
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:53,791
You have a drink.

934
01:23:57,375 --> 01:23:59,458
I am not talking to console you.

935
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:03,208
All the doctors have said that you
need not be anxious about his case.

936
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:07,500
Since we took time to diagnose his disease
we need to give him a long-term treatment.

937
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:08,916
That is all

938
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:14,000
Some days back ,when I saw a swelling
on his leg I asked Chinnama about that.

939
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:18,875
Then I told her not to worry and
may be that was an insect bite.

940
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:22,500
Does he have any
doubt about this?

941
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:26,291
Joseph…Don’t be so gloomy.

942
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:29,708
Tell him stories and
jokes as always.

943
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:49,125
Joseph..

944
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:54,458
Joseph

945
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:34,750
I am travelling to heaven
riding the chariot of time

946
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
To see your place...

947
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:43,416
Why do you always
listen to this song?

948
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:57,291
Oh..My! You have a fever.

949
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,583
Come

950
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:15,208
Fever has become normal.
Nothing to worry.

951
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:18,000
Ok?

952
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:26,166
Mummy, Please make
me sit properly

953
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,416
Mummy will you give me
my crayons and papers?

954
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,916
You are weak now.Do
you want it now?

955
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:42,375
Yes..Mummy I have to
draw a lot of pictures

956
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:46,333
You can do that when you are
not this weak.Is it ok?

957
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:50,416
I had told you about
his immunity.

958
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:52,250
Body is very weak.

959
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,541
Let the present
treatment continue

960
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,083
It will take some time.

961
01:26:56,458 --> 01:27:00,500
I would not have let you go out of the
hospital if you were some other patients.

962
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:04,083
In Clint’s case, your
house is nearby.

963
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:07,708
I thought let him relax
and draw pictures.

964
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:09,541
He would be happy too

965
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:15,166
But you have to be
more careful now

966
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:22,750
Playing with other children ….see..
even a minor viral infection…

967
01:27:23,291 --> 01:27:24,875
Sir Can he travel?.

968
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:27,208
Not very far off… Just to
Kozhikode and not immediately

969
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:30,541
Sir..You must have heard about
Universal Art painting competition

970
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,375
That is a major painting
competition in Kerala

971
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,083
About ten thousand children
participate in that.

972
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,166
Doctor..If he can’t go for this…

973
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:51,208
He was so upset that he could
not go for Sanker’s competition

974
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:55,041
Last time I had
told you something.

975
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,833
You didn’t take it seriously

976
01:27:57,375 --> 01:27:58,958
About his hair cut.

977
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,250
I think one of the reasons for
his present fever is that.

978
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:04,458
Doctor…How can I?!

979
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,375
No Excuse.

980
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:12,458
Still you haven’t understood the
seriousness of what I told you.

981
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,041
Mohan,

982
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:33,375
Didn’t you hear the
doctor’s strict words?

983
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:37,916
His hair has to be
shaved off completely..

984
01:28:39,916 --> 01:28:42,541
How can I convince my son?

985
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:47,125
I will try to convince him.
He will listen to me

986
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,416
Clint

987
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:14,375
Ammu, Come inside

988
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:16,541
Come in

989
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:16,916
No

990
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:19,875
Aunty said children
shouldn’t go in

991
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,791
You will get fever

992
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:25,708
That is for other
kids and not for Ammu

993
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,666
I came to give you something

994
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:42,166
Picture of mine dancing
at the school function.

995
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:44,875
You were in the
hospital on that day

996
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:52,333
You have to keep the peacock
feather in darkness.

997
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:54,583
Then only it will multiple
into many feathers.

998
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:59,000
Let me go Clint Will come later.

999
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:13,125
Ammu? You didn’t go
to school today?

1000
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:14,333
Today is a holiday.

1001
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:16,208
Isn’t it a Saturday

1002
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:17,708
Oh..I forgot that

1003
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:20,125
I stayed only for a while.

1004
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,958
Came to give him something

1005
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:24,875
It is ok

1006
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:37,166
Let us have medicine

1007
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:56,375
Here is Yesudas classical
for you to listen.

1008
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:58,583
No one in?

1009
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,500
Papu..When does a
rainbow appear?

1010
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:12,958
I want to see a rainbow

1011
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,333
For that..the rainbow
has to appear..Dear

1012
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:18,708
When will it appear?

1013
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:22,291
Don’t you know ..when it rains..

1014
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,166
In abheri raga

1015
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:27,083
Listen..Please come here

1016
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:29,791
Papu will be back in a sec. Dear

1017
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:40,041
It is him.The barber
we asked to come

1018
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:43,291
My God..How will I make
him agree to this?

1019
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:46,500
But you said Mohan
has convinced him

1020
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:50,000
That is what Mohan
says..Who knows?

1021
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:11,083
Get me water in a
vessel and a stool

1022
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,291
Where is he? Call him

1023
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:55,166
Son..

1024
01:32:58,291 --> 01:33:02,916
Didn’t doctor uncle say you
had to shave off your hair.

1025
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:08,208
That man is here…Come

1026
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:17,708
Dear

1027
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:20,083
Didn’t doctor uncle say?

1028
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:20,916
Yes

1029
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:36,250
Finished..

1030
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:41,583
He looks smart with
hair shaved off..

1031
01:36:54,166 --> 01:36:55,750
Son… Dear

1032
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:30,041
Did you draw the magic
of stars, all over ?

1033
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:38,583
With a rainbow …

1034
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:43,916
Oh…sky..

1035
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:48,083
For a moment..

1036
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:54,541
Expressions turned
into moonshine

1037
01:37:55,208 --> 01:38:02,166
Hopes turned into moonshine

1038
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:16,250
With a rainbow in the sky …

1039
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:26,791
You painted the magic of stars

1040
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:31,958
Oh…sky..

1041
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:36,333
For a moment..

1042
01:38:36,666 --> 01:38:43,375
Expressions turned
into moonshine

1043
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:52,208
Hopes turned into moonshine

1044
01:38:53,333 --> 01:39:04,666
As a tender drop of water..

1045
01:39:05,166 --> 01:39:14,250
Did the blue clouds wait?

1046
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:25,333
Into this vacillating mind,

1047
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:32,333
Colors trickled and filled up.

1048
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:40,708
Colors trickled and filled up.

1049
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:29,291
Come…Look who has come!!

1050
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:33,416
Sister!

1051
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,875
You look handsome now,
with the hair cut.

1052
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:42,958
Just a minute sister.Let
me finish this.

1053
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:46,166
Sister

1054
01:41:56,083 --> 01:41:57,458
Chinnamma…

1055
01:41:58,083 --> 01:41:59,500
Sister…..My son!!

1056
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:01,458
Don’t be sad, Chinnamma.

1057
01:42:02,166 --> 01:42:03,916
Isn’t he my son as well?

1058
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,625
All our prayers are with him

1059
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:08,750
Jesus will protect him

1060
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:12,250
Chinnamma

1061
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:32,583
Look ..Sister I finished that

1062
01:42:35,458 --> 01:42:37,083
Wow!! Beautiful!!

1063
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:40,041
The sun slowly going
down,down and down

1064
01:42:40,416 --> 01:42:43,875
Next week,we are going to Kozhikode
to participate in the competition.

1065
01:42:44,208 --> 01:42:45,000
Oh..

1066
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:46,375
Will you come with us, Sister?

1067
01:42:46,541 --> 01:42:48,958
Sorry dear.. I can’t come

1068
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:50,541
Lot of work in the school

1069
01:42:50,833 --> 01:42:53,958
Lot of kids
participates in that.

1070
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:57,000
I will pray to Lord

1071
01:42:57,208 --> 01:43:00,333
You will get the first prize.

1072
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:05,500
Five..

1073
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:11,875
One

1074
01:43:14,791 --> 01:43:15,458
One

1075
01:43:18,875 --> 01:43:21,791
I feel sorry for
Josephettan and Chinnamma

1076
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:24,041
How can any parent bear it?!

1077
01:43:24,458 --> 01:43:26,458
It is like Markandeyan’s tale.

1078
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:28,833
When they got a perfect child, the
child has a very short life!!

1079
01:43:30,375 --> 01:43:33,208
Ammu swallowed by the snake…

1080
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:37,916
Since it is so serious why don’t they take
him to the Medical College at Trivandrum

1081
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:42,916
I pointed that out to Joseph.
But it seems there is no point

1082
01:43:50,416 --> 01:43:51,541
Let me go..

1083
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:54,791
What is it, Dear?

1084
01:43:56,583 --> 01:43:57,958
I will be back soon..

1085
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:32,208
Clint..

1086
01:44:34,166 --> 01:44:36,791
Your peacock feather
didn’t multiply.

1087
01:44:37,333 --> 01:44:40,291
I didn’t show it
in the sun..Truly

1088
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:45,416
I overheard daddy
talking to mummy.

1089
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:49,125
Is it true,Clint?

1090
01:44:50,833 --> 01:44:57,333
When your peacock feather grows
into a big feather forest …

1091
01:44:57,666 --> 01:45:00,416
… both of us will play
around in that forest.

1092
01:45:52,083 --> 01:45:54,041
I am on leave this afternoon

1093
01:45:57,958 --> 01:45:59,458
Joseph Sir…

1094
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,750
Don’t you need this?

1095
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:11,083
One sided paper for
your son to draw ..

1096
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:07,166
Joseph..

1097
01:47:09,625 --> 01:47:10,916
Why are you like this?

1098
01:47:11,916 --> 01:47:13,500
I was looking for you everywhere

1099
01:47:13,916 --> 01:47:16,250
I called up your office. Then I got
to know that you were on leave.

1100
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:20,250
I went to your home.They said
you had not reached there.

1101
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:28,916
Don’t we have to take Clint to Kozhikode
for the painting competition?

1102
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,166
It is on the 5th?
Today it is already 24th.

1103
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:39,541
Kunjunni Mash had
called some time back

1104
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:47,291
He heard Clint is admitted in hospital and
not participating in the competition.

1105
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:49,875
I told him everything.

1106
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:56,041
He says if possible Clint
should be made to participate.

1107
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,416
He wants to go..

1108
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:02,708
But so far …??

1109
01:48:04,083 --> 01:48:05,166
He should go.

1110
01:48:06,208 --> 01:48:10,708
Otherwise, it will be something we
do against ourselves or against him

1111
01:51:28,666 --> 01:51:29,916
Is it over?

1112
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:31,833
Almost over. In
another 5 minutes.

1113
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,875
Clint has finished and
submitted his work

1114
01:51:34,208 --> 01:51:36,166
All of them will come now

1115
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,083
M T Vasudevan Nair had
come to meet him.

1116
01:52:17,125 --> 01:52:19,291
Kunjunni Mash also was there.

1117
01:52:23,625 --> 01:52:26,125
Papu ,Let us get out
of this ruckus.

1118
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:28,875
I feel breathless

1119
01:52:42,375 --> 01:52:45,000
Papu..Why Mohan
uncle didn’t come?

1120
01:52:45,708 --> 01:52:50,083
He went to meet someone in Kozhikode.
He will come tomorrow.

1121
01:52:57,666 --> 01:53:00,041
Papu What is that?

1122
01:53:00,916 --> 01:53:03,166
Theyyam

1123
01:53:03,708 --> 01:53:06,625
Stop the car. I want to see

1124
01:53:08,666 --> 01:53:11,208
Just stop the car ,Bro

1125
01:53:12,416 --> 01:53:13,666
Reverse

1126
01:53:45,416 --> 01:53:48,000
Papu, What is a theyyam?

1127
01:53:49,708 --> 01:53:52,750
That is an art form
from north Malabar

1128
01:53:53,833 --> 01:53:57,083
There are different
types of theyyams.

1129
01:53:58,416 --> 01:54:00,416
Which one is this?

1130
01:54:01,666 --> 01:54:04,125
This is Muchilot Bhagavathy

1131
01:54:52,541 --> 01:54:53,875
What happened, Dear?

1132
01:55:33,125 --> 01:55:34,333
Joseph..

1133
01:55:39,041 --> 01:55:39,708
Chinnamma..

1134
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,500
There is a happy news

1135
01:55:43,416 --> 01:55:46,333
He wins the gold medal in the
Universal Arts Painting competition.

1136
01:55:46,458 --> 01:55:47,625
Really?

1137
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:49,291
Proud of you

1138
01:55:49,541 --> 01:55:50,458
Listen

1139
01:55:51,041 --> 01:55:55,083
He comes first in the competition where
ten thousand children participated.

1140
01:55:56,166 --> 01:55:57,833
Kunjunni mash had
called from Kozhikode.

1141
01:55:57,916 --> 01:55:59,708
It was there in the news at 7

1142
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:02,625
Oh..We don’t listen
to radio nowadays.

1143
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:06,083
He will dominate tomorrow’s
news in the papers

1144
01:56:08,125 --> 01:56:09,166
Why are you not happy?

1145
01:56:09,208 --> 01:56:12,041
Mohan Uncle, I want to
finish this picture

1146
01:56:12,333 --> 01:56:14,833
Carry on

1147
01:56:16,541 --> 01:56:17,666
Come

1148
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:21,416
He saw theyyam on our
return from Kozhikode

1149
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:23,083
- Let me see
- Then he started drawing that day

1150
01:57:11,916 --> 01:57:13,291
It is already too late

1151
01:57:13,625 --> 01:57:15,166
Why don’t you draw tomorrow?

1152
01:57:15,666 --> 01:57:18,125
I have to finish it
now itself, Mummy

1153
01:57:19,125 --> 01:57:21,791
You go and sleep.I will be here

1154
01:57:22,375 --> 01:57:26,583
Mummy..Is there
moonlight outside?

1155
01:57:27,333 --> 01:57:28,291
Yes, Son

1156
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:31,291
Then,take me outside.

1157
01:57:31,625 --> 01:57:33,750
I want to see the moonshine

1158
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:01,541
Mummy

1159
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:06,625
Is it true that we all
become stars after death?

1160
01:58:07,041 --> 01:58:08,791
A star in the sky..

1161
01:58:11,875 --> 01:58:17,291
How will Papu and Mummy recognize
me from among so many stars?

1162
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:19,416
My darling!!

1163
01:58:54,666 --> 01:58:57,541
How many colors are
there on this earth!!

1164
01:58:58,333 --> 01:59:02,166
So many colors that I would
never be contended seeing..!!

1165
01:59:03,916 --> 01:59:07,166
And come to think of it…I
have to leave all these…!

1166
01:59:14,833 --> 01:59:16,541
My darling won’t go anywhere.

1167
01:59:18,958 --> 01:59:20,708
I won’t let that happen

1168
02:00:41,458 --> 02:00:42,500
Papu…

1169
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:39,291
Doctor,

1170
02:01:40,875 --> 02:01:43,125
Shall we shift him to
the Medical College or…

1171
02:01:44,458 --> 02:01:46,375
As you like

1172
02:01:49,208 --> 02:01:52,000
Look. Sometimes a
miracle may happen

1173
02:01:52,541 --> 02:01:53,708
Other than that…!!

1174
02:01:54,083 --> 02:01:55,541
Doctor!!

1175
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:59,083
Isn’t there doctor
above all of us!!

1176
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:01,291
Now, everything rests with Him

1177
02:02:37,416 --> 02:02:38,583
What happened?

1178
02:02:39,208 --> 02:02:40,583
What did the doctor say?

1179
02:02:43,416 --> 02:02:46,875
Mohan, what did the doctor say?

1180
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:51,208
No problems. He may have
to go for dialysis.

1181
02:02:51,958 --> 02:02:53,666
After that, we can go home

1182
02:03:26,541 --> 02:03:27,250
Papu..

1183
02:03:30,458 --> 02:03:31,208
Papu..

1184
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,500
What did the doctor say?

1185
02:03:42,916 --> 02:03:44,166
Tell me

1186
02:03:47,583 --> 02:03:50,875
What did the doctor say?

1187
02:04:11,208 --> 02:04:12,000
Doctor..

1188
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:05,708
Can you remove this?

1189
02:05:07,666 --> 02:05:10,000
Looks like he wants to talk..

1190
02:05:10,041 --> 02:05:11,541
I will call the doctor

1191
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:29,250
I can remove it for some time

1192
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,458
Mummy… From where am I
hearing firecrackers?

1193
02:05:51,833 --> 02:05:53,458
Isn’t it Vishu today,Darling?

1194
02:05:54,125 --> 02:06:02,875
Everyone must be bursting
crackers.Srikanth, Srikakla ,Sijoy and all.

1195
02:06:03,333 --> 02:06:08,041
Bright yellow flowers must have
blossomed everywhere. Isn’t it Mummy?

1196
02:06:09,833 --> 02:06:15,375
Mummy.. Now Ammu must be lighting
colored sparklers..!! Is it?

1197
02:06:16,458 --> 02:06:23,000
My son.. All our
neighbors are here..

1198
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:29,208
Papu..What is the
color of sky now?

1199
02:06:33,458 --> 02:06:34,916
It is the color of twilight.

1200
02:06:37,166 --> 02:06:38,916
It is about to be twilight

1201
02:06:40,583 --> 02:06:44,875
Red, Yellow and Blue mixed together.

1202
02:06:45,541 --> 02:06:51,125
And clouds flying around
like light feathers.

1203
02:06:51,791 --> 02:06:54,166
How beautiful it
would be to see!!

1204
02:06:57,166 --> 02:06:59,833
When will the rainbow appear?

1205
02:07:01,291 --> 02:07:02,541
It will come..

1206
02:07:03,958 --> 02:07:07,125
When the rainbow
appears in the sky ..

1207
02:07:07,625 --> 02:07:11,375
With all the seven colors mixed
with seven melodies[ragas]…!

1208
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:15,083
I could not draw that ..Papu

1209
02:07:18,291 --> 02:07:19,625
You can draw.

1210
02:07:20,458 --> 02:07:22,208
Still there is time left

1211
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:28,458
Mummy, I want to go home

1212
02:07:28,625 --> 02:07:32,875
Then, I want to light up
our home with candles

1213
02:07:33,333 --> 02:07:39,583
I want to see all my
pictures in the candlelight.

1214
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:16,875
What is that, Dear?

1215
02:08:17,375 --> 02:08:18,125
Mummy..

1216
02:08:18,291 --> 02:08:22,000
You have to keep all
these pictures.

1217
02:08:23,250 --> 02:08:25,333
After some time…..

1218
02:08:28,625 --> 02:08:29,916
My darling!!

1219
02:08:31,708 --> 02:08:36,166
Mummy, Will you carry
me on your shoulders?

1220
02:08:39,833 --> 02:08:40,541
Come

1221
02:08:44,708 --> 02:08:45,916
Are you feeling sleepy?

1222
02:08:46,166 --> 02:08:47,125
No..

1223
02:08:48,458 --> 02:08:51,500
Mummy, Can you sing that song for me?

1224
02:09:04,708 --> 02:09:09,208
In the rhythm of
a waves ensemble

1225
02:09:15,875 --> 02:09:20,291
And that of an ‘onam’ song

1226
02:09:22,708 --> 02:09:24,708
Sing.. Mummy

1227
02:09:50,375 --> 02:09:51,625
Come

1228
02:09:59,583 --> 02:10:02,041
Your dear Clint is
feeling sleepy.

1229
02:10:03,125 --> 02:10:05,583
I will lie on Papu’s chest.

1230
02:10:05,833 --> 02:10:09,833
When Mummy calls me,
I may not wake up.

1231
02:10:09,916 --> 02:10:11,375
Then..don’t be sad Mummy

1232
02:10:11,583 --> 02:10:13,458
And you too..Papu

1233
02:10:32,166 --> 02:10:33,916
Mummy, Don’t cry..

1234
02:10:37,625 --> 02:10:41,458
Read me the Crucifixion
from the Bible

1235
02:10:43,541 --> 02:10:45,541
I want to sleep
listening to that.

1236
02:10:46,916 --> 02:10:51,208
Mummy, You shouldn’t stop
reading even if I fall asleep

1237
02:11:19,708 --> 02:11:25,041
And it was about the sixth hour

1238
02:11:27,333 --> 02:11:34,583
and there was a darkness over all
the land ,until the ninth hour

1239
02:11:35,958 --> 02:11:37,500
And then the sun was darkened

1240
02:11:39,083 --> 02:11:44,541
and the veil of the temple
rent through the midst.

1241
02:11:44,875 --> 02:11:50,000
And Jesus cried with a
loud voice and said

1242
02:11:51,708 --> 02:11:59,500
’Father into thy hands
I commend my spirit”

1243
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:12,541
And when he thus had said,
he gave up the ghost

1244
02:12:19,208 --> 02:12:23,041
Now when the centurion
saw what was done,

1245
02:12:23,125 --> 02:12:29,250
he glorified God, saying ,Of
a surety this man was just.

1246
02:12:31,125 --> 02:12:38,208
And all the people that came together to that sight,
beholding
the things which were done, smote their breasts,and
returned.

1247
02:12:38,708 --> 02:12:48,833
And all his acquaintances stood afar off,and the women
that followed him from Galilee ,beholding these things

1248
02:12:58,291 --> 02:13:04,083
Then Pilate spake again to them
,willing to let Jesus loose.

1249
02:13:04,458 --> 02:13:09,500
But they cried, saying,
crucify, crucify him

1250
02:13:09,916 --> 02:13:12,416
And he said unto
them the third time,

1251
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
But what evil hath he done?

1252
02:13:16,083 --> 02:13:19,666
I find no cause of death in him;

1253
02:13:20,333 --> 02:13:23,875
I will therefore chastise
him ,and let him loose.

1254
02:13:24,750 --> 02:13:29,000
But they were instant with loud voices,
and required that he might be crucified.

1255
02:13:29,458 --> 02:13:32,666
And the voices of them and of
the high Priests prevailed.

1256
02:13:33,583 --> 02:13:37,250
So Pilate gave sentence ,that
it should be as they required.

1257
02:13:37,375 --> 02:13:43,583
And he let loose unto them him that for
insurrection and murder was cast into prison,

1258
02:13:43,958 --> 02:13:49,541
whom they desired, and delivered Jesus
to do with him what they would.

1259
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:55,208
And as they led him away
Jesus turned back unto them,

1260
02:13:55,458 --> 02:13:58,958
and said, daughters of
Jerusalem ,weep not for me,

1261
02:13:59,041 --> 02:14:02,000
but weep for yourselves,
and for your children

1262
02:14:02,416 --> 02:14:04,666
For behold the days will
come when men shall say,

1263
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:08,416
Blessed are the barrenand the wombs that never
bare,and the paps which never gave suck.

1264
02:14:08,666 --> 02:14:15,041
Then shall they begin to say to the mountains,
Fall on us, and to the hills, cover us

1265
02:14:15,166 --> 02:14:20,291
For if they do these things to a green
tree,what shall be done to the dry?

1266
02:14:20,625 --> 02:14:25,791
And there were two others, which were
evildoers, led with him to be slain

1267
02:14:26,250 --> 02:14:28,791
And when they were come to the
place ,which is called Calvery,

1268
02:14:28,916 --> 02:14:29,833
Who is there?

1269
02:14:29,916 --> 02:14:32,166
….there they crucified
him ,and the evil doers,

1270
02:14:32,291 --> 02:14:34,416
one at the right hand and
the other at the left

1271
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:37,625
Then said Jesus ,Father, forgive
them ,for they know not what they do

1272
02:14:44,125 --> 02:14:46,458
Son..Dear Son

1273
02:14:48,166 --> 02:14:50,875
Who kept my son in the rain?

1274
02:14:51,666 --> 02:14:52,000
What?

1275
02:14:52,041 --> 02:14:54,500
Who kept my son in the rain?

1276
02:14:54,666 --> 02:14:56,666
There..our son

1277
02:14:58,166 --> 02:15:00,000
No one is there

1278
02:15:00,458 --> 02:15:01,833
There..Our son

1279
02:15:02,375 --> 02:15:03,750
No one is there..Come

1280
02:15:06,958 --> 02:15:07,833
Come Sit down

1281
02:15:07,916 --> 02:15:09,041
Who kept my son…
