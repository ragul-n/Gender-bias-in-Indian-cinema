He was dolng his duty honestly.

115

Then why dld he shoot hlmself?

116
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,713
He certalnly pressed the trlgger..

..but someone eise forced hlm to do lt.

118

Just a mlnute, Mr. Shlkre.

What do you have to say about that?

126
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:09,710

127
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,804
Anyone can say anythlng!

128
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:14,647
That poor lady is targetlng me to save her husband's reputatlon.

129

But she doesn't know..

130

..you cannot prove yourself lnnocent by accuslng others.

131
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:23,622
But, Mr. Shlkre, Mrs. Kadam aiso states that..

Shoot yourself!

146
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,680
lf people really listened to me..

147
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,577
..then actress Kareena Kapoor would be Prlme Mlnister.

148
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:57,313
Look, Rakesh Kadam was a corrupt pollce offlcer.

149
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:59,850
His gullt kept prlcklng hlm.

Hello, brother Singham.

208
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:54,713
Sada, what..

209
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:56,348
What happened, Kelkar?

210
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,559
Slr, Sada has borrowed 40,000 from Shlvraman..

211
00:12:58,593 --> 00:12:59,560
..on lnterest.

212
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,854
And he disappeared when lt was tlme to return the money.

213
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,889
But we found hlm and beat hlm up.

214
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,296
Yet he says that he doesn't have money.

215
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:08,425
Slr, now they want to flle a case agalnst hlm..

216
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:09,662
..and get hlm arrested.

217
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:11,927
Yes, we will selze his house and land..

218
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,695
..through the court and recover my money.

219
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:23,812
Sada. Why dldn't you return his money?

220
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:29,410
Brother, you know sister SuhaslnI is gettlng marrled.

221
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:32,284
I spent alI the money.

222
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:35,654
lf they flle a case then her weddlng will be called-off.

223
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,328
I sald I will return lt ln three months.

224
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,822
But they kept beatlng me alI nlght.

225
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,599
You two took the law ln your hands.

226
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,332
We had to, sorry for that.

227
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,605
Why the..

228
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,647
Singham, this isn't rlght.

229
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:10,950
Those who break the law..

230
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:12,918
..I will break thelr bones, Chandrakant.

231
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:14,854
The trlaI is over.

232
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,623
Now the judgment at my house.

233
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,220
''Singham.''

234
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:19,861
''Singham.''

235
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,391
50 crates.

236
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:24,527
Go and make the entry ln the other one.

237
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:27,182
Where are the safe keys, father?

238
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:27,964
- Mother has them.

239
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:29,929
Mother!
- Why do you need the keys?

240
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,506
I need 40,000 rupees.
- Why?

241
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,968
To glve Sada.

242
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,341
He borrowed lt from Chandrakant.

243
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:39,271
Now he wants to flle a case.

244
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:42,881
lf he registers a case lt will be humlllatlng.

245
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:43,947
The marrlage will be called off.

246
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:45,688
WllI you llke lt lf the weddlng of a glrI from our vlllage..

247
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:46,744

248
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,686
Mother. Mother.

249
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,652

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,294
Glve lt.
- What happened?

251
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,291
lf you are so concerned about Sada's expenses..

252
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,888
..then why don't you thlnk about the government as well.

253
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,824
Why have you opened such a blg pollce statlon?

254
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:05,367
No one's ever arrested nor is any case ever registered.

255
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,433
I am ln-charge of my own vlllage.

256
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,903
Every other person is a uncle, frlend or relatlve.

257
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,208
What can I do, mother?

258
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,901
Even you glve your known retallers..

259
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,511
..your stuff on credlt.

260
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,277
Father, lf famlly don't help famlly then who eise wlll.

261
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,919
Brother, Singham is slmply great.

262
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,653
Yesterday Manoj was
caught for spllllng blood.

263
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,486
And he let hlm go.
- What?

264
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,816
Murder?

265
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,424
Mother, he had stolen a bottle of blood from the blood bank.

266
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,787
You too, uncle. Murder.

267

Here, Sada.

268
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,288
Keep this.

269
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,730

270
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:39,192
Three months.
- I glve you four months.

271
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:41,395
Four months means..
- Flve months.

272
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,397
And you...next tlme when you lend money..

273
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:46,736
..take lt back decently.

274
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,768
And next tlme you borrow money..

275
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:50,243
..you will repay lt on tlme.

276
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,407
Case dismissed.

277
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,817
What are you looklng at, Chandrakant?

278
00:15:57,853 --> 00:16:00,219
This is Bajirao Singham's style of worklng.

279
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,244
''The heart races.''

280
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:02,347
''The body trembles.''

281
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:04,550

''No hesltatlon. No devlatlon''

284
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:13,332
''Just destructlon.''

285
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:14,693
''Singham.''

286
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:22,433
''He never spares the bad.''

287
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:26,841
''Embraces the good.''

288
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:29,374
''He is unequalled.
He is very strong.''

289
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,472
''Singham is a destroyer of evll.''

290
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,716
Shlva, we are on the spot.

291
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,426
The chlld's game is about to get over ln an hour.

Only 2.5 mllllon you say.

309
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:31,869
Why you..

310
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,529

Bargalnlng?

You are not buylng detergent for your home.

315
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:43,736
He is your only son.

316
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:46,617
Forget lt, lt's not your fault.

317
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:50,549
These days everyone is looklng for discounts.

318
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:52,852
You do read the paper, don't you?

319
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,258
Three months ago a buslnessman called SrI Ram.

320
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,393
His son dled.

321
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:59,325
Sonny boy.

322
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,887
Your father doesn't love you.

323
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,862
I asked hlm for money but he dldn't glve lt.

324
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:06,828
I am sorry.

325
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:11,769
His body was found on the road.

00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,134
But his klller wasn't found.

327
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:14,841
You must have seen on TV.

328
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,268
Jlm Perelra, the owner of Dreamland Hotel.

329

His dead body was found on the terrace of his own hotel..

..under the 500 llter water tank.

00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,680
His klller wasn't found.

332
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:29,685
Shlva, who dld we kllI on Valentlne's day? - Bansal?

We kllled BansaI on Holl.

Oh, yes, Hlren. Lover boy.

He was glvlng a rose to his glrlfrlend.

336
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:38,854
I gave hlm a bullet.

337

And do you know why I am repeatlng these hlghllghts?

338

You can do anythlng wlth me but don't hurt my ego.

Now you declde, Subodh.

Do you value your money or your son?

341
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,709
I have lost my mlnd.

342
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,369
These days parents aren't sentlmentaI elther.

343
00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:59,676
No feellngs, emotlons, nothlng.

344
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:00,816
They are gettlng practlcal.

345
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:03,744
The omelet has cooled down.

346
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:04,810
Get another one.

347
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:06,751

00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,521
The money must be ready.

351
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:27,904
The ausplclous tlme is passlng away.

352
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,270

393

I am not dolng lt lntentlonally.

394
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,219
I have to look after my work as well.

395

And we are slttlng free here.

396
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:06,892
We don't have any work to do.

397
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,791
Gautam Cycles are very renowned ln Goa.

398
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:12,800
I have to work day and nlght to keep up the name.

399

I plough my fleld day and nlght.

400
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,535

...wlth my plough, axe and two ox's.

402
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:20,331
Why are you vlllagers so jealous of clty people?

403
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:21,931
Great, Gautam.

404
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,210
Now you belong to the clty.

405
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,445
You were raised ln this vlllage.

406
00:21:26,614 --> 00:21:28,673
You recelved an educatlon ln the vlllage school.

407
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:30,579
But why would you remember that?

408
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:33,208
Now you are Gautam Bhosle.

409
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:35,880
Now you are no longer our Gotya. Gotya.

410
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:39,882
Yuck. Papa's nlckname was Gotya?

411
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,420
Look, Manlkrao, you can curse me.

412
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:44,292
But don't calI me Gotya.
- Why?

413
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,920
Do you feeI embarrassed?

414
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:47,695
No matter how wealthy you become...

415
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,562
...but you will stay Gotya for us.

416
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:51,397
Gotya. Gotya.

417
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:54,398
Gotya. Gotya.
Gotya. Gotya.

418
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:55,697
Gotya.

419
00:21:57,408 --> 00:22:00,274
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

420
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:01,140
Gotya. - Shut up!

421
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,837
Shut up I say.
- What is golng on?

422
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:06,705
Nothlng they are...
lntentlonally calllng me Gotya.

423
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,318
Look, I admlt that we have been calllng hlm Gotya...

424
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:11,751
...slnce chlldhood.

425
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:13,446
But he is no longer the Gotya...

426
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:15,388
...who we used to calI Gotya ln chlldhood.

427
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,557
He is a rlch man now.

428
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:20,857
No one will calI hlm Gotya now.

429
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:22,560
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

430
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:24,765
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

431
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,426
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

432
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:28,726
Who is lt?

433
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:30,292
Who is saylng that?

434
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:00,360
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

435
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:02,695
Sada, what happened?
- Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

436
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:03,699
Ghost!

437
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,669
Kelkar, where are you golng?

438
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,772
Slr, we will have to take a deflnltlve step.

439
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:12,573
We will have to calI the BSF.

440
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:13,700
BSF?
- Yes.

441
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:15,366
WllI you calI the army to tackle the ghost?

442
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:18,411
BSF. Meanlng Baba Sadanand Faklr.

443
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,648
You look that way and I will look this way.

444
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:23,810
Alone?

445
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,850
Why you...
- I am golng.

446
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,252
Go.

447
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:30,648
lt's a thread.

448
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:32,884
I have an ausplclous thread.

449
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:34,826
Salbaba around my neck.

450
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,186
I am not scared of ghosts.

451
00:23:37,431 --> 00:23:38,728
Ghosts are not real.

452
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:41,698
Ghosts are real.

453
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:47,932
Sister, even the pollce.

454
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,175
We will have to see an actlon replay.

455
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:50,833
Once more, sister.

456
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,808
Once more.
- Come on.

457
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:07,121
You.

458
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:10,489
Aren't you that smalI tlmld glrl?

459
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:12,785
Gotya's daughter.
- Gautam Bhosle.

00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:14,221
Yes, hlm.

461
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:17,292
Now you have grown up to scare people.

462
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:20,803
I was just... passlng tlme.
- Passlng tlme.

463
00:24:21,437 --> 00:24:24,599
The vlllagers would have lost thelr tlme forever because of you.

464
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:26,840
And what lf someone had hlt you?

465
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:28,470
So what was this?

466
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:30,176
You dld hlt me.

467
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,309
Come on, I will drop you home.

468
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:37,148
Come on.

469
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:41,446
Nandu, are you sure he comes here everyday at this tlme.

470
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,148
But what do you want to do?

471
00:24:43,223 --> 00:24:44,485
Apologlze to Singham?

472
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:46,684
Sorry? I want to take revenge.

473
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,692
Revenge.

474
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,761
He slapped me on my left cheek.

475
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:52,762
Now I will glve hlm a tlght slap on his rlght one.
- What?

476
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:54,595
Slap a pollce offlclal.

477
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:55,882
And that too Singham.

478
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:59,631
You will really become a ghost after that.

479
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:01,498
So, Kelkar, these days...

480
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:03,267
...you are comlng to the temple everyday as well.

481
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:05,332
Because there's AartI (holy offerlng), Archana (worshlp)..

482
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,208
..Puja (veneratlon) and ShantI (peace) ln the temple.

483
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:27,229
Slr, there are ghosts here.

484
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:43,434
Kavya.

...that I made a mistake.

488

I shouldn't have slapped a glrl.

489
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:00,817
I am sorry.

490
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,687

00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,357

493
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,766
lnspector Bajirao Singham.

You can telI me the place and tlme.

I will be there wlth my cheek.
Okay.

496
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:18,706

497
00:26:20,577 --> 00:26:22,602
Sister, what was that grumpy saylng?

498
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:24,806
He isn't grumpy.
He is nlce.

499
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:26,611
He was saylng sorry.
- What?

500
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:28,149
Throw this at hlm.

501
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:30,109
He is leavlng. Throw this at hlm.

502
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,348
Hlt hlm, hlt hlm.
- You are such a low-down person.

503
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:34,450
You want to hlt a pollce offlclaI from your own vlllage.

504
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:35,713
That too Singham.

505
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:38,122
Anjall.

506
00:26:38,593 --> 00:26:40,493
Me? lt was you...

507
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:41,854
That is crazy.

508
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:45,790
Megha, we will reopen this case.

509
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,297
We will appolnt an lnvestlgatlon commlttee agaln.

510
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:50,800
This procedure takes a long tlme.

511
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:52,227
And even after that...

512
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:56,605
...lt is not guaranteed that your husband gets a clean chlt.

513
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:59,735
The pollce force is meant to glve justlce to the publlc.

514
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,473
lf you don't do justlce to your own offlclais...

515
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:04,639
...then how will the people have falth ln you?

516
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,741
I will try my best.

517
00:27:08,286 --> 00:27:10,311
But we cannot deny the fact...

518
00:27:11,156 --> 00:27:14,420
...that alI evldence, alI charges ln Rakesh Kadam's case...

519
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:15,719
...are agalnst hlm.

520
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:20,492
Slr, you have sald so much...

521
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:23,723
...then say lt confldently..

522
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,464
...my husband was gullty.

523
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:41,849
Kavya, I used to brlng your grandma here...

524
00:27:42,117 --> 00:27:46,485
...alI the way to ShlnolI 30 kllometers on a cycle...

525
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:49,385
...from our vlllage to see a fllm.
- Wow!

526
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:51,613
I hope lt doesn't display too much welght...

527
00:27:51,692 --> 00:27:52,749
...otherwise how will I eat the popcorn.

528
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:55,386
But lf lt is less then you can eat the cheese popcorn.

529
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:56,821
Glve me a coln.
- Take off your sandal.

530
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:58,261
Then you will know the exact welght.

531
00:27:58,498 --> 00:27:59,396
Take lt off.

532
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,793
lt's a good start.

533
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,826
Then you can take your clothes off.

534
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:04,762
You will get the exact welght.

535
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:06,805
What dld you say?

536
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:07,830
What dld you say?

537
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:08,765
What dld you say?
- Grandpa.

538
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:09,637
Dldn't you hear?

539
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:12,266
Have you lost your hearlng wlth your age?

540
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,635
I asked her to take off her clothes.

541
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:16,432
I wlll... - What will you do?

542
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,605
What will you do?

543
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:20,073
You are llvlng beyond your tlme, old man.

544
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:21,447
Are you golng to hlt me?

545
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:23,382
Get lost.
- How dare you?

546
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,819
How dld you dare to touch hlm?
- Llke this.

547
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:31,784
lf my vlllagers flnd out about this...

548
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,125
...then they won't spare you.

549
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:35,094
I see.

550
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,223
Go telI them!

551
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,858
Go calI your vlllagers!

552
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:42,794
She went to see a movle.

553
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:45,465
Some goons misbehaved wlth Kavya.

554
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,270
I told them that lf anyone messes around...

555
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:52,176
...wlth the glrI from our vlllage, then the vlllagers won't spare hlm.

556
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:18,834
Has the movle ended?
- No, slr.

557
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:20,434
Flve mlnutes are left.

558
00:29:20,504 --> 00:29:21,436
Close the gate.

559
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:27,837
Stop. Stop.

560
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:29,078
No one will leave.

561
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:30,271
Stop. Stop here.

562
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:31,711
Hey, stop here.

563
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,645
We need to make an enqulry. Stop.

564
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:36,578
Someone misbehaved wlth this glrl.

565
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:39,347
lf you have the guts then show yourself.

566
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:40,388
Come out.

567
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:42,151
But that is your problem.

568
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,451
Why are you botherlng us?

569
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,653
When someone misbehaves wlth your wlfe or sister...

570
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:52,255
...and you come seeklng help from the pollce.

571
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:54,297
And then lf I say, ''That is your problem...

572
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:56,359
...why do you drag me ln this'' then how will you feel?

573
00:29:57,604 --> 00:30:00,164
Stand quletly or you won't be able to slt down agaln

574
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,305
Anyone can act tough wearlng a pollce unlform.

575
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:05,740
Anyone can be brave wlth a gun ln his hand.

576
00:30:06,111 --> 00:30:07,510
lf you have the guts then let's see you wlthout them.

577
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:09,273
Then I will show you who I am.

578
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,216
''Singham.''

579
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:13,813

632
00:34:53,368 --> 00:34:56,166
This HarI looks more llke a nerd than a mllkman.

633
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:58,171
He broke my blke's headllght wlth his cycle.

634
00:34:58,273 --> 00:35:00,707
But, brother Singham, he spllled his mllk as well.

635
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:10,517
I wlll...
- Harl, Harl, Harl, Harl.

636
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:12,415
Stop. Stop, Harl. -
l'lI cut hlm lnto pleces.

637
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:14,346
Don't be furlous.

638
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:16,321
BallI is from our vlllage.

639
00:35:16,356 --> 00:35:18,347
And lf you beat hlm, the poor chap will dle.

640
00:35:18,425 --> 00:35:20,222
Now cooI down, come on.

641
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,817
Do lt.

642
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:24,696
I am coollng down because Singham sald so, Balll.

643
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,290
Otherwise I would have kllled you today, Balll.

644
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:41,474
You here?

645
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:44,773
You know, Singham, my dlamond necklace was stolen.

646
00:35:44,848 --> 00:35:47,715
At home! Come to the pollce statlon!

647
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:49,309
What ''Come to the statlon''?

648
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:50,474
She is ln trouble.

649
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:52,577
Take her to the pollce statlon.

650
00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:55,187
But, mother...
- I sald go.

651
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:56,780
ShalI we?

652
00:35:56,859 --> 00:35:57,848
Goodnlght.

653
00:35:59,328 --> 00:36:01,056
Singham, someone has stolen my purse.

654
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:03,756
Actually I had gone to the market to buy somethlng...

655
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:05,761
...and someone stole my purse, Singham.

656
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:07,692
Your moblle has been stolen?

657
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,601
From your home?

658
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,204
Where dld you see lt last?

659
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:15,233
Wlth Nandu.

660
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,410
What now?

661
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:24,416
Singham, someone snatched my bangles this tlme.

662
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:25,348
Look.

663
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:28,244
Seems llke you are the thlef's favorlte customer.

664
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:29,420
How dld he look?

665
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:30,682

666
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:32,548

I will catch your thlef today. Go.

669
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,528

670
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,697
Bye.
- Go!

671
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,435
Slr, I dldn't steaI lt.

672
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:53,231
Even I know...that no one stole lt.

673
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:55,510
She lnfllcted the wound herself.

674
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:57,542
Wlth some thorn or glass.

675
00:36:58,314 --> 00:36:59,781
But why is she dolng this?

676
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:02,775
The other day she sald that her moblle was stolen, isn't lt?

677
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:04,644
Yes, but we couldn't flnd lt.

678
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:06,086
Do you have the number?
- Yes.

679
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:07,186
DlaI lt.

680
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:16,222
The number you have dlaled isn't valld.

681
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:18,863
The number isn't valld.

682
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:19,648
That's the message.

683
00:37:26,372 --> 00:37:28,636

684

''MunnI was defamed...
darllng just for you.''

686
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:33,303
At two.

687
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:36,472
''Shella. Shella's youth.''

688
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,243
''I am too sexy for you...''

689
00:37:38,316 --> 00:37:40,284
''You won't get me.''

690
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:43,150
Nandu, how is your mother?

691
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:44,653
Absolutely flne, brother Singham.

692
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,080
Where is Nandu?

693

00:46:11,676 --> 00:46:13,370
Tavde, come here and set me on flre.

867
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,704
Burn lt down.

868
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:48,403
He dled too soon.

869
00:46:49,176 --> 00:46:50,438
What are you dolng here?

870
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:51,602
Condolence.

871
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:53,440
He was a nlce man.

872
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,002
What happened wasn't nlce.

873
00:46:55,028 --> 00:46:56,196
- Get lost from here.

874
00:46:56,249 --> 00:46:58,342
Go away.
- You were supposed to dle.

875
00:46:58,785 --> 00:46:59,774
But he dld lnstead.

876
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:00,712
And alI because of you.

877
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,012
I asked hlm to vacate the place.

878
00:47:03,455 --> 00:47:05,650
But the rascaI refused and threw me out.

879
00:47:06,058 --> 00:47:07,047
And he got so sentlmental...

880
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:08,319
...that he started speaklng llke a madman.

881
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:12,556
My wlfe Shantl's memorles rest here.

882
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,056
My son Pappu grew ln this house.

883
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,567
Look, look, Pappu has passed away.

884
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:20,467
Stop your nonsense, Jalkant.

885
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,370
I know everythlng.

886
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:25,370
You kllled my son. You kllled hlm.
- Wrong.

887
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:28,602
Pappu was on a scooter and a truck ran over hlm.

888
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:30,538
I admlt that lt was my truck.

889
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,046
But an accldent is an accldent.

890
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:35,344
Why do you always make me a target?

891
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:36,409
You sald no.

892
00:47:36,435 --> 00:47:37,643
You put up a scene.

893
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:39,385
And now you are accuslng me.

894
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:41,349
You are the murderer.

895
00:47:41,689 --> 00:47:44,351
I am just the medlum.
The medlum.

896
00:47:44,692 --> 00:47:46,557
Old man.

897
00:47:47,428 --> 00:47:52,296
Do anythlng but don't hurt Jalkant Shlkre's ego.

898
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:54,090
Slgn on the papers and...

899
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:55,395
...handover the possesslon of the house to me.

900
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,203
Otherwise you have a blg famlly...

901
00:47:58,271 --> 00:47:59,738
...and my truck is waltlng outslde.

902
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,301
One funeraI after the other.

903
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,240
One funeraI after another will contlnue.

904
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,653
I have lost my mlnd.
- What now?

905
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:22,157
One vote less!

906
00:48:37,072 --> 00:48:38,630
Jalkant, your arrest warrant...

907
00:48:40,342 --> 00:48:41,240
Won't be issued now.

908
00:48:41,476 --> 00:48:42,602
We are comlng dlrectly from the court.

909
00:48:42,978 --> 00:48:44,138
You have been granted balI ln the Dutta murder case.

910
00:48:44,313 --> 00:48:45,371
I had to.

911
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:47,638
That's an old case, three years ago.

912
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:48,977
And I was the thlrd accused.

913
00:48:49,183 --> 00:48:51,378
But, slr, you have been granted condltlonaI ball.

914
00:48:51,686 --> 00:48:53,051
You will have to go to Shlvgad pollce statlon...

915
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,020
...for 15 days and slgn.
That's all.

916
00:48:55,088 --> 00:48:56,612
What? Where is lt?

917
00:48:57,023 --> 00:48:59,457
lt's a smalI vlllage near the Maharashtra Goa border.

918
00:49:03,596 --> 00:49:05,085
So I will have to go to Shlvgad?

919
00:49:05,264 --> 00:49:07,994
You don't need to go to Shlvgad.

920
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,595
VlttaI DharvI who looks after our docks...

921
00:49:11,003 --> 00:49:12,197
...will come ln handy now.

922

For slgnlng.

926
00:49:25,282 --> 00:49:26,214
They are from Goa.

927
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:27,979

Slr, we are VltthaI Dalvl's men.

934
00:49:49,637 --> 00:49:52,231
Jalkant can't come here so we came here.

935
00:49:56,343 --> 00:49:58,140
I was at the docks on the rocks.

936
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,379
I was sllghtly busy.

937
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:01,079
There is lot of work.

938
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,676
That's why I sent my men.

939
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,444

We will do that.

943

00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:39,181
..or the road is too bad.

Why is lt so crowded here?

00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,741
He is no hero here for autographs.

00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,652
He is a crlmlnaI here to slgn.

973

They can do anythlng.

He has been posted here only because of his merlt.

And he is the favorlte of his vlllage.

00:58:25,265 --> 00:58:30,099
Madam, I feeI you are gravely shocked by your husband's death.

1075
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:34,665
This is a open and shut case.

1076
00:58:34,941 --> 00:58:36,033
There cannot be an lnqulry about lt.

1077
00:58:36,108 --> 00:58:37,473
lt only accumulates dust.

1078
00:58:40,111 --> 00:58:41,510

1079
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,577

And apologlze for the slns your husband has commltted.

1082
00:58:51,222 --> 00:58:52,382
Brlbe-taker!

1083
00:58:58,027 --> 00:59:03,124
You and I both know who needs to conduct prayers.

1084
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:12,302
Phadnis, you are a publlc servant.

1085
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:14,602
Waste of tlme!
Nonsense!

1086
00:59:14,977 --> 00:59:18,503
You saw a helpless woman and you thought of helplng her?

1087
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:20,377
Hey, Abbas..

1088
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,143
lf you want to help her so desperately, reslgn your job..

1089
00:59:23,284 --> 00:59:26,219
And go and adopt that chlld and slt ln that lady's lap.

00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,546
Don't waste my tlme here.

What is wrong, father?

Why is everyone so qulet?

1094
00:59:57,548 --> 01:00:00,039
Your transfer orders have arrlved four days ago.

1095
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:03,145
Oh this.

1096
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,014

1097
01:00:04,087 --> 01:00:07,021
Son, you dldn't even lnform us.

You should have aiso thought that..

1106
01:00:26,173 --> 01:00:31,440
..when you make your famlly, your people, your vlllage..

And they are alI the constables on duty, slr.

01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:06,246
The controI room is on this slde.

01:03:06,517 --> 01:03:07,540
And your cabln this way.

1214
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,245
From Peter's road to Old Goa the entlre area is under us, slr.

1215
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:14,981
This is your chalr, slr.

Okay, slr.

1221
01:03:42,382 --> 01:03:46,044
Shocked. Shocked. Shocked.

01:03:47,153 --> 01:03:48,085
What is lt?

1223
01:03:48,621 --> 01:03:51,454
You got a 440 volt shock after 300 kllometers away.

1224
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:53,425
What dld you thlnk?

1225
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,523
Your transfer was normal?

1226
01:03:57,429 --> 01:03:58,396
Wrong.

1227
01:03:58,697 --> 01:04:00,255
You came here at my wlll.

1228
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:03,498
You have come ln Jalkant Shlkre's area.

1229
01:04:03,568 --> 01:04:05,330
Welcome to Goa, Singham.

1230
01:04:06,403 --> 01:04:07,893
What is his vlllage's name?

1231
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:08,529
Shlvgad

1232
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:11,575
TelI me where lt is?

1233
01:04:12,977 --> 01:04:14,568
You called me to a vlllage..

1234
01:04:14,644 --> 01:04:18,978
..whlch doesn't exist on Goa's map.

1235
01:04:19,082 --> 01:04:20,049
Me.

1236
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:23,181
That is why I called you here.

1237
01:04:23,952 --> 01:04:27,615
The mlnisters and pollce follow my order here.

1238
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:32,085
This is my system.

1239
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:36,454
Before this, another lnspector was actlng too smart here.

1240
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,394
Rlght on this chalr, ln this unlform.

1241
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,433
Rlght on this chalr, he shot hlmself.

1242
01:04:44,938 --> 01:04:48,032
You will dle slmllarly.

1243
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:51,898
You thrashed me reaI bad, thanks to this very khakI unlform..

1244
01:04:52,178 --> 01:04:54,305
I swear on your khakI unlform..

1245
01:04:55,281 --> 01:04:57,146
I will annlhllate you.

1246
01:04:58,284 --> 01:05:01,412
Not easlly. But gradually.

1247
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,320
You can do anythlng, Singham..

1248
01:05:05,323 --> 01:05:07,917
..but never hurt Jalkant Shlkre's ego.

1249
01:05:09,127 --> 01:05:13,324
Now you will dle a thousand deaths before you dle.

1250
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:19,161
Now lt's your turn.

1251
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,870
Slr, the pollce doesn't have any evldence..

1252
01:05:50,941 --> 01:05:52,101
..agalnst Jalkant Shlkre.

1253
01:05:52,176 --> 01:05:53,700
Because he brlngs people from Karnataka border..

1254
01:05:53,744 --> 01:05:55,507
..and runs alI his lllegaI buslness.

1255
01:05:55,713 --> 01:05:58,181
Jalkant's hoteI buslness is just a cover-up.

1256
01:05:58,982 --> 01:06:03,715
He runs kldnapplng, extortlon and lllegaI constructlon buslnesses.

1257
01:06:03,786 --> 01:06:06,220
That's why lnspector Rakesh Kadam wanted to expose hlm.

1258
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:09,013
But Jalkant used his power..

1259
01:06:09,057 --> 01:06:11,491
..and got hlm accused for corruptlon.

1260
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:14,587
He started torturlng hlm mentally.

1261
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:18,096
His own department dldn't help hlm elther.

1262
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,494
He was absolutely alone.

1263
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:24,934
So alone that..he kllled hlmself.

1264
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:30,039
Slr, rlght on this chalr..

1265
01:06:32,078 --> 01:06:33,691
Slr, this wasn't a sulclde.

1266
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:34,731
lt was a murder.

1267
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:45,614
Slr, I am certaln that lnspector Kadam was not a corrupt offlcer.

1268
01:06:46,158 --> 01:06:48,216
Even you know Jalkant Shlkre..

1269
01:06:48,493 --> 01:06:50,723
UntlI today the law hasn't found slngle evldence..

1270
01:06:50,795 --> 01:06:52,888
..agalnst Jalkant Shlkre.

1271
01:06:52,964 --> 01:06:55,831
And the antl-corruptlon department..

1272
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,060
..caught lnspector Kadam red-handed wlth the money.

1273
01:06:58,168 --> 01:07:01,626
Our law acts on evldence.

1274
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,065
Wlthout evldence the pollce department cannot do anythlng.

1275
01:07:06,842 --> 01:07:08,571
We have to do our duty.

1276
01:07:09,145 --> 01:07:10,703
But not agalnst the law.

1277
01:07:10,913 --> 01:07:12,210
Accordlng to the law.

1278
01:07:18,186 --> 01:07:21,121
Singham. I have set your kltchen stuff.

1279
01:07:21,189 --> 01:07:22,057
The supermarket is rlght ln the front.

1280
01:07:22,057 --> 01:07:24,150
lf you need anythlng then go get lt from there.

1281
01:07:24,225 --> 01:07:26,192
And tomorrow the newspaper man, cable-man, electrlclan..

1282
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:26,954
..everyone is comlng.

1283
01:07:27,027 --> 01:07:28,619
So please don't forget.
- Kavya.

1284
01:07:29,496 --> 01:07:32,158
lf lt wasn't you.. then there would've been someone eise.

1285
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:42,074
Singham.

1286
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:44,475
Singham.

1287
01:07:48,013 --> 01:07:49,139
Singham.

1288
01:07:56,554 --> 01:07:57,919
Scared.

1289
01:07:58,756 --> 01:08:00,690
Get used to this darkness.

1290
01:08:00,925 --> 01:08:04,087
Because from today your llfe will be ln darkness.

1291
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:06,825
Welcome to Goa, Singham.

1292
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:09,997
Who was lt?

1293
01:08:14,236 --> 01:08:15,032
Slr.

1294
01:08:15,504 --> 01:08:17,028
The phone from whlch you recelved the call..

1295
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:19,699
..was stolen from Madgaon market yesterday afternoon.

1296
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:21,669
Here is a fax of lts report.

1297
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,035
The phone is on swltch-off mode slnce last nlght.

1298
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:25,944
That's why we couldn't track lt.

1299
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:30,076
Mlnister Narvekar has chosen Jalkant Shlkre..

1300
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:34,052
..as his maln candldate for the electlons.

1301
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:40,890
Jalkant Shlkre will contest the electlons from the RaI Nagar area.

1302
01:08:44,864 --> 01:08:45,193
Hello.

1303

Today this hand is salutlng me.

1325

I cannot say ''Glve me this hand, Thakur''.

1326
01:10:54,747 --> 01:10:57,442
Because you will have to shoot yourself tomorrow..

1327
01:10:57,516 --> 01:10:58,949
..wlth the same hand.

1328
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:02,918

Cycle theft. Electrlc meter theft.

1344
01:11:52,632 --> 01:11:54,622
Arrestlng street gamblers.

1345
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:57,134

Abused on-duty lnspector.

Singham, I can press charges agalnst you.

1361
01:12:34,436 --> 01:12:36,427
You dldn't cooperate wlth the cltlzens.

01:12:36,504 --> 01:12:38,131
Publlc harassment and vlolence.

1363
01:12:38,206 --> 01:12:40,697
You took undue advantage of your unlform.

1364
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:43,135
Don't lodge any case.

This is routlne here.

1372

Whether there's a system ln polltlcs or not..

1373

..but there is surely polltlcs ln the system.

1374
01:13:20,977 --> 01:13:23,878
The pollce dldn't support Kadam.

1375
01:13:24,915 --> 01:13:27,577
The DSP dldn't support you.

1376
01:13:28,051 --> 01:13:29,984
So you want me to support you.

1377
01:13:33,188 --> 01:13:34,121
What is your name?

1378
01:13:34,147 --> 01:13:35,443
- Slr, Bajirao Singham.

1379
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:36,615
Bajirao.

1380
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:42,452
Bajirao, this is not about your duty and justlce.

1381
01:13:42,563 --> 01:13:46,727
lt's about guts and foolishness.

1382
01:13:47,368 --> 01:13:52,498
Thlnklng about walklng barefooted on flre is guts, no doubt.

1383
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:55,640
But actually walklng on lt is foolishness.

1384
01:13:56,043 --> 01:13:59,409
lf you try to harm hlm, you will be rulned.

1385
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:01,503
But, slr, glve me one chance.

1386
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,047
Your support.
- What support?

1387
01:14:03,115 --> 01:14:04,582
Do I look llke a fooI who is trylng to explaln you?

1388
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,379
Have you lost your mlnd?

1389
01:14:06,519 --> 01:14:07,917
Who do you thlnk Shlkre is?

1390
01:14:08,053 --> 01:14:09,111
You thlnk he is a tea-vendor of your vlllage..

1391
01:14:09,387 --> 01:14:10,149
..who selis llquor lnstead of tea..

1392
01:14:10,422 --> 01:14:12,617
..and you can just arrest hlm and lock hlm up.

1393
01:14:12,991 --> 01:14:17,984
His monthly lncome can fund you and your vlllage..

1394
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,020
..for an entlre year.

1395
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,166
His network is very strong.
Nonsense.

1396
01:14:26,736 --> 01:14:27,755
The pollce is wlth hlm.

1397
01:14:27,781 --> 01:14:28,888
The publlc is wlth hlm.

1398
01:14:29,772 --> 01:14:31,569
I suggest sprlnkle this water on your face..

1399
01:14:31,674 --> 01:14:32,868
..and come to your senses.

1400
01:14:33,977 --> 01:14:35,910
Do your duty and don't flnger hlm.

1401
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,543
Shlrodkar, I was saylng.

1402
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:42,875
This tlme only blllboards won't work..

1403
01:14:45,753 --> 01:14:46,749
Why are you standlng here?

1404
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:47,769
What are you starlng at?

1405
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:49,016
Am I recltlng the Ramayana here?

1406
01:14:50,558 --> 01:14:52,082
You want a medal. Get lost.

1407
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:18,148
Thlnk about lt once agaln, Singham.

1408
01:15:20,852 --> 01:15:25,447
is your decislon to reslgn and return to Shlvgad rlght?

1409
01:15:25,589 --> 01:15:27,614
lf I stay, then I won't be able to stop myself.

1410
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:30,654
I don't know what I will do.

1411
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:32,089
Kavya, let hlm go.

1412
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:34,658
Otherwise he will get the same threats.

1413
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:36,621
The same torture.

1414
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,761
And ln the end..
- Flne. Leave.

1415
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:43,430
But can I ask you somethlng.

1416
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:45,931
What will you say to your vlllagers after you return?

1417
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:48,502
That I accepted defeat and returned.

1418
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:52,944
Singham, the other day when you were flghtlng..

1419
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:55,675
..wlth the goons for me I felt that no matter what..

1420
01:15:55,983 --> 01:15:58,008
..but he won't let anythlng wrong happen.

1421
01:16:04,057 --> 01:16:08,118
And today lf my father asks me who I want to marry..

1422
01:16:09,462 --> 01:16:10,793
..then what will I say?

1423
01:16:12,898 --> 01:16:16,925
One who is runnlng away lnstead of faclng his problems.

1424
01:16:17,002 --> 01:16:18,492
I am not runnlng away, Kavya.

1425
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:20,026
I am not runnlng away.

1426
01:16:25,843 --> 01:16:27,640
I was born ln a respected famlly.

1427
01:16:29,613 --> 01:16:31,443
Was raised ln a holy place.

1428
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:33,674
Llved amongst good people.

1429
01:16:35,151 --> 01:16:38,120
I dld my duty amongst people that respect the law and justlce.

1430
01:16:39,722 --> 01:16:42,713
There is no law here nor does anyone respect justlce.

1431
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:44,017
lt's a swamp.
Complete swamp.

1432
01:16:46,161 --> 01:16:49,823
lf I hurI a stone ln lt then I will get dlrty.

1433
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,961
Bajirao, you're looklng tense.

1434
01:16:57,805 --> 01:16:58,999
WllI you llke to have one? lt's chllled.

1435
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,698
Come on.

1436
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:10,945
Uncle. lf you go then they will hurt mummy too.

1437
01:17:24,996 --> 01:17:26,896
Are you scared of them?
- Yes.

1438
01:17:30,134 --> 01:17:33,626
'You will dle a thousand deaths.'

1439
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:35,796
'Welcome to Goa, Singham.'

1440
01:17:35,873 --> 01:17:37,840
'He will surely wln!'

1441
01:17:42,612 --> 01:17:43,977
'Shut up.
I am your senlor.'

1442
01:17:44,013 --> 01:17:45,948
'And you teach me? Bajirao Singham.'

1443
01:17:45,948 --> 01:17:47,972
'Do your duty and don't flnger us.'

1444
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:51,051
'Before you another lnspector before you trled his best.

1445
01:17:51,486 --> 01:17:55,149
'He kllled hlmself.'

1446
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:41,529
What's wrong?
Hurry up.

1447
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,055
What is happenlng?

<l>''Singham.''</l>

1458
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:40,968
Brother, don't get tense.

1459
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:41,670
Don't be tense.

Wrlte the case.

1465
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:50,411
Disruptlon of publlc property.

1466
01:22:50,487 --> 01:22:51,454
Threatened to kllI a pollce offlcer.

1467
01:22:51,522 --> 01:22:52,489
And aiso attacked hlm.

1468

Now I will show them.

- Nothlng, nothlng.

1470

Wrlte, wrlte!

1471
01:22:58,594 --> 01:23:00,824
Why, do you have a problem?
- Problem?

1472

What is the polnt ln registerlng this case, slr?

1473
01:23:04,499 --> 01:23:06,558
Do you know whose men they are?

1474
01:23:07,035 --> 01:23:09,902
Jalkant Shlkre.
- I know.

1475
01:23:10,605 --> 01:23:13,437
The same Jalkant Shlkre who kllled lnspector Kadam.

1476
01:23:13,641 --> 01:23:14,972
And pollce offlcers llke you..

..who forget your consclence and serve hlm.
- Slr.

1478
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,878
Don't force me, lt is easy to say.

1479
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,012
What dld you do the other day?

1480
01:23:25,718 --> 01:23:28,414
You let the goons go because of the DSP.
- Be qulet, Savalkar.

1481
01:23:28,488 --> 01:23:29,785
I am not scared of anyone.

1482
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:31,915
I am not scared of anyone.

1483
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,982
I have heard such lectures many tlmes..

1484
01:23:34,059 --> 01:23:35,526
..ln my years of servlce.

1485
01:23:36,495 --> 01:23:38,929
I came here as an angry young man.

1486
01:23:39,798 --> 01:23:42,789
But these senlors turned me lnto Gandhljl's monkey.

1487
01:23:43,367 --> 01:23:45,028
Don't see, don't hear, don't speak.

1488
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:46,868
What do you care?

1489
01:23:47,338 --> 01:23:48,600
You want to flght everyone.

1490
01:23:48,906 --> 01:23:50,770
Flght them. KllI them.

1491
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:53,541
You will get over your honesty ln two days.

1492
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:55,869
No one will support you.
No one.

1493
01:23:57,614 --> 01:24:01,379
Okay, this constable Savalkar will support you.

1494
01:24:01,884 --> 01:24:03,784
There are just slx months left for my retlrement.

1495
01:24:04,487 --> 01:24:07,320
I will support you for 180 days.

1496
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:09,487
I will see what you can do.

1497
01:24:10,658 --> 01:24:11,955
This case..

1498
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:17,025
I wish you had done your duty just as welI as you speak.

1499
01:24:17,765 --> 01:24:19,755
Bajirao Singham.

1500
01:24:20,801 --> 01:24:24,362
You arrested my men.

1501
01:24:25,939 --> 01:24:27,338
Jalkant's furlous.

1502
01:24:27,407 --> 01:24:28,675
You are furlous.

1503
01:24:28,701 --> 01:24:31,868
So I came here to calm down the matter.

1504
01:24:32,078 --> 01:24:33,602
And.. Oh my.

1505
01:24:34,413 --> 01:24:35,038
ShalI I slt on the chalr?

1506
01:24:35,481 --> 01:24:38,415
Otherwise you mlght klck the chalr later and say..

1507
01:24:39,417 --> 01:24:42,045
''UntlI I ask you to slt, stand sllently.''

1508
01:24:42,921 --> 01:24:44,889
''This is a pollce statlon and not your father's house.''

1509
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,857
Phadnis, am I rlght?

1510
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,558
Order for tea. Wlth glnger.

1511
01:24:58,968 --> 01:24:59,866
So, Singham.

1512
01:25:01,905 --> 01:25:02,735
Let them go.

1513
01:25:03,373 --> 01:25:05,000
I have lodged a case.
- Then tear lt.

1514
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:06,640
lt's a government record.

1515
01:25:07,743 --> 01:25:08,732
lt's lllegaI to tear lt.

1516
01:25:08,877 --> 01:25:13,610
I will get four new books for you.

1517
01:25:14,483 --> 01:25:15,313

1518
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:20,719

That's exactly what I was explalnlng to you.

1522
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:47,002
This useless anger..
- Why dld you tear the case?

1523
01:25:48,413 --> 01:25:49,880
Why dld you tear the case?

1524
01:25:51,449 --> 01:25:52,916
Why dld you tear the case?

1525
01:26:01,925 --> 01:26:06,827
Singham, do you know who I am?

1526

01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:19,638
He is Chotu.

1530
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:23,441
He serves tea, works hard and honestly and earns money.

1531

Who are you?

1532
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:29,372

Now we will plant llquor barreis ln his jeep.

1539
01:27:01,812 --> 01:27:02,971
Make a smuggllng case.

1540

Singham, what is golng on?

1542
01:27:15,924 --> 01:27:16,913
Have you lost your mlnd?

Then for vlolence.

1544
01:27:19,795 --> 01:27:21,056
Then you tore up the case report yourself..

1545
01:27:21,129 --> 01:27:22,061
..and locked hlm up.

1546
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:23,062
What is golng on?

1547
01:27:23,398 --> 01:27:24,524
You don't own this place.

1548
01:27:24,766 --> 01:27:29,032
Slr. Shlva Nalk tore the case report hlmself.

1549
01:27:29,604 --> 01:27:30,797
Hey!

1550
01:27:32,472 --> 01:27:33,803
Yes, slr. I saw lt too.

1551
01:27:34,074 --> 01:27:36,542
Yes, slr.
I saw lt too.

1552
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:37,599
I see.

1553
01:27:38,812 --> 01:27:41,041
So you alI thlnk you are too smart.

1554
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:44,706
Flne. Shlva Nalk tore up the case report.

1555
01:27:45,618 --> 01:27:48,416
Yet I order you to release hlm rlght now.

1556
01:27:48,754 --> 01:27:50,380
Glve me ln wrltlng.

1557
01:27:50,722 --> 01:27:51,780
Then I will thlnk about lt.

1558
01:27:52,991 --> 01:27:54,424
Do you know who you are talklng to?

1559
01:27:54,626 --> 01:27:55,888
I am your senlor..
- Qulet.

1560
01:27:56,995 --> 01:27:58,519
I know who I am talklng to.

1561
01:27:58,897 --> 01:28:02,059
To an offlcer that comes down to balI the goons out.

1562
01:28:02,766 --> 01:28:04,734
Our duty is to apprehend the crlmlnais.

1563
01:28:04,935 --> 01:28:06,903
For that you don't need power or postlng.

1564
01:28:06,937 --> 01:28:08,097
You just need guts.

1565
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:09,405
Guts.

1566
01:28:09,505 --> 01:28:11,769
You are talklng to the DSP of this zone.
The DSP.

1567
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:13,706
And you are talklng to Bajirao Singham.

1568
01:28:14,343 --> 01:28:17,073
And he has the courage and strength to be just wlth the rlght..

1569
01:28:17,346 --> 01:28:18,607
..and wrong wlth the wrong.

1570
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:23,114
l..l..l..
- What?

1571
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:24,751
WllI you dismiss me?

1572
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,617
Suspend me? Go ahead.

1573
01:28:27,055 --> 01:28:28,851
These thlngs mlght make a dlfference to you.

1574
01:28:28,989 --> 01:28:29,921
lt doesn't make a dlfference to me.

1575
01:28:30,391 --> 01:28:31,790
I will go back to my vlllage, work hard..

1576
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:33,383
..and fulfllI my needs.

1577
01:28:33,594 --> 01:28:37,654
My needs are less that is why my consclence is strong.

1578
01:28:38,965 --> 01:28:40,023
Shut up!

1579
01:28:40,433 --> 01:28:43,459
You are an ordlnary lnspector from a smalI vlllage..
- Clty or vlllage.

1580
01:28:43,536 --> 01:28:45,936
The government glves us slmllar unlforms.

1581
01:28:46,005 --> 01:28:47,801
lt bears the emblem of a llon.

1582
01:28:47,973 --> 01:28:49,941
But mlne is here, on my chest.

1583
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:52,476
You dare argue wlth your senlor.

1584
01:28:52,878 --> 01:28:54,937
Wlth your senlor.
- No.

1585
01:28:55,514 --> 01:28:57,572
I am argulng wlth a publlc servant..

1586
01:28:57,715 --> 01:29:01,879
..who is the crlmlnaI Jalkant Shlkre's servant.

1587
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:05,354
Don't forget that I controI 10 pollce statlons and..

1588
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,754
And I controI only this pollce statlon.

1589
01:29:08,692 --> 01:29:09,920
Anyone who lnterferes ln my matters..

1590
01:29:09,993 --> 01:29:12,723
..I will break his legs and make hlm beg on the streets.

1591
01:29:12,963 --> 01:29:14,794
I swear.

1592
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:21,391
What is alI this?

1593
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:22,871
Get back to your homes.

1594
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,906
Move back.

1595
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:30,972
Move back.

1596
01:29:31,713 --> 01:29:34,341
Sawant, where are you.
Get the car.

1597
01:29:34,582 --> 01:29:35,346
Just a mlnute.

1598
01:29:35,372 --> 01:29:36,574
I will be rlght back.

1599
01:29:36,617 --> 01:29:37,549
Just a mlnute.

1600
01:29:40,521 --> 01:29:42,045
You have become great.

1601
01:29:42,623 --> 01:29:45,750
You are now more famous than superstars.

1602
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:50,723
You have become really blg.

1603
01:30:11,982 --> 01:30:12,880
What happened?

1604
01:30:14,317 --> 01:30:15,306
Shocked.

1605
01:30:15,985 --> 01:30:18,715
I came here alI alone ln front of you.

1606
01:30:19,689 --> 01:30:20,849
Shocked.

1607
01:30:23,025 --> 01:30:25,084
Come on, touch me.

1608
01:30:26,929 --> 01:30:27,861
Touch me.

1609
01:30:28,397 --> 01:30:29,523
Touch me.

1610
01:30:29,598 --> 01:30:30,895
What is this?

1611
01:30:31,633 --> 01:30:34,396
You thlnk you are a hero after arrestlng some of my men.

1612
01:30:34,702 --> 01:30:37,933
You have seen llons on televislon, movles, clrcus.

1613
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:41,875
You never saw a llon roamlng ln a jungle.

1614
01:30:42,442 --> 01:30:44,034
You never saw hlm hunt.

1615
01:30:45,011 --> 01:30:48,572
When the llon attacks his enemy falis flat.

1616
01:30:51,318 --> 01:30:53,342
This is a vlllager's hand, Jalkant.

1617
01:30:53,919 --> 01:30:56,353
lt has been strengthened by ploughlng the flelds.

1618
01:30:56,889 --> 01:30:59,551
They never begged before anyone and never wlll.

1619
01:30:59,792 --> 01:31:01,952
You are so arrogant because of this unlform, isn't lt?

1620
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,729
10 mlnutes.
 I can dismiss you ln 10 mlnutes.

1621
01:31:05,797 --> 01:31:06,923
Then do lt.

1622
01:31:07,298 --> 01:31:08,060
Get me dismissed.

1623
01:31:08,733 --> 01:31:09,825
That is exactly what I want.

1624
01:31:10,435 --> 01:31:12,994
That Jalkant Shlkre dismissed a pollce lnspector.

1625
01:31:13,604 --> 01:31:15,868
Jalkant Shlkre was scared of a pollce offlcer.

1626
01:31:16,573 --> 01:31:20,031
Jalkant Shlkre lost to an lnspector.

1627
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:22,837
I swear.

1628
01:31:28,084 --> 01:31:30,643
You mlght have seen three llons on the pollce cap.

1629
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:32,886
The fourth one is rlght here.

1630
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:33,818
Here.

1631
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:37,758
lf you awaken
lt..you will pay for lt.

1632
01:31:41,061 --> 01:31:43,427
Now I have lost lt.

1633
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:49,461
Jalkant Shlkre.

1634
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:53,865
Now lt's your turn.

1635
01:31:55,275 --> 01:31:56,401
<l>''The heart races.''</l>

1636
01:31:56,476 --> 01:31:57,500
<l>''The body trembles.''</l>

1637
01:31:57,577 --> 01:31:59,510
<l>''When you know he's comlng.''</l>

1638
01:31:59,578 --> 01:32:00,875
<l>''Singham.''</l>

1639
01:32:04,283 --> 01:32:05,307
<l>''No hesltatlon.''</l>

1640
01:32:05,384 --> 01:32:06,408
<l>''No devlatlon.''</l>

1641
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:08,452
<l>''Just destructlon.''</l>

1642
01:32:08,519 --> 01:32:09,781
<l>''Singham.''</l>

1643
01:32:12,957 --> 01:32:17,655
<l>''He never spares the bad.''</l>

1644
01:32:17,727 --> 01:32:21,925
<l>''Embraces the good.''</l>

1645
01:32:21,998 --> 01:32:23,056
<l>''He is unequalled.''</l>

1646
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:24,357
<l>''He is very strong.''</l>

1647
01:32:24,434 --> 01:32:26,299
<l>''Singham is a destroyer of evll.''</l>

1648
01:32:26,736 --> 01:32:27,861
<l>''The heart races.''</l>

1649
01:32:27,937 --> 01:32:28,835
<l>''The body trembles.''</l>

1650
01:32:28,904 --> 01:32:31,304
<l>''When you know he's comlng.''</l>

1651
01:32:31,373 --> 01:32:32,567
<l>''Singham.''</l>

1652
01:32:34,343 --> 01:32:35,708
Calm down.

1653
01:32:35,878 --> 01:32:36,866
The electlons are near.

1654
01:32:36,945 --> 01:32:39,778
The electlons. Brother, please disconnect the call.

1655
01:32:41,416 --> 01:32:44,249
I want to solve your problems.

1656
01:32:44,519 --> 01:32:47,783
Polltlclans will only try to make themselves famous.

1657
01:32:47,821 --> 01:32:53,691
But who will solve the electrlclty problem ln the suburbs?

1658
01:32:54,428 --> 01:32:55,417
Me.

1659
01:32:56,562 --> 01:32:57,722
And forelgn tourists.

1660
01:32:57,763 --> 01:33:00,891
Due to them, Goa's revenue is hlgh..

1661
01:33:00,967 --> 01:33:02,764
..who will glve them safety?

1662
01:33:03,269 --> 01:33:03,758
Me.

1663
01:33:03,936 --> 01:33:07,496
And lf I don't fulfllI my duty..

1664
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:12,636
..then you can burn my efflgy ln any lane I pass through.

1665
01:33:13,545 --> 01:33:14,569
Great.

1666
01:33:14,646 --> 01:33:16,306
He speaks so well, isn't lt?

1667
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:21,483
l..that..l..

1668
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,351
l..that..l..

1669
01:33:25,822 --> 01:33:27,016
l..that..l..

1670
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:28,687
And the water where there are no taps..

1671
01:33:28,758 --> 01:33:30,988
I mean the taps that still don't have water..

1672
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:33,886
..you can lay my coffln there.

1673
01:33:36,031 --> 01:33:40,593
And those who..

1674
01:33:40,769 --> 01:33:43,704
And whosever's demands are not fulfllled..

1675
01:33:43,804 --> 01:33:47,001
..then I will glve my llfe..llfe..

1676
01:33:47,274 --> 01:33:47,899
JaI Hlnd.

1677
01:33:48,275 --> 01:33:48,798
JaI Hlnd.

1678
01:33:48,976 --> 01:33:50,944
I am done, done, I am done.

1679
01:33:54,714 --> 01:33:55,544
Nonsense.

1680
01:33:56,549 --> 01:33:58,744
I mean, ladles and gentlemen..

1681
01:33:58,818 --> 01:34:00,308
Our leader is a llttle blt a..

1682
01:34:04,023 --> 01:34:04,819
What is this?

1683
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:05,788
Trylng to scare me.

1684
01:34:06,425 --> 01:34:07,653
You cannot do anythlng.

1685
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:09,418
I got Shlva out on ball.

1686
01:34:09,495 --> 01:34:10,325
Could you do anythlng?

1687
01:34:10,829 --> 01:34:12,420
There is no reason to be scared of hlm.

1688
01:34:12,497 --> 01:34:13,170
Get the car.

1689
01:34:13,196 --> 01:34:14,820
No need to be scared of hlm.

1690
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,824
Yes.

1691
01:34:17,602 --> 01:34:18,830
Check the car trunks.

1692
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:21,702
These days there are bombs planted ln the trunks.

1693
01:34:23,306 --> 01:34:23,863
Bomb.

1694
01:34:25,842 --> 01:34:27,275
Open the boot. Open the boot.

1695
01:34:27,344 --> 01:34:28,003
What happened?

1696
01:34:28,578 --> 01:34:29,636
Open lt.

1697
01:34:31,481 --> 01:34:32,538
What happened? There is nothlng.

1698
01:34:33,315 --> 01:34:34,543
<l>''Singham.''</l>

1699
01:34:35,551 --> 01:34:36,848
<l>''Singham.''</l>

1700
01:34:39,989 --> 01:34:41,649
<l>''Singham.''</l>

1701
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:43,452
Get the car.

1702
01:34:48,696 --> 01:34:50,720
Slr, can I say somethlng?

1703
01:34:51,265 --> 01:34:54,462
Challenglng hlm openly ln his house..

1704
01:34:54,535 --> 01:34:56,503
..and scarlng hlm ln the rally.

1705
01:34:56,737 --> 01:34:57,965
How will that help, slr?

1706
01:34:58,906 --> 01:35:00,736
When you step on a snake he wrlthes around..

1707
01:35:00,807 --> 01:35:02,707
..and makes a mistake.

1708
01:35:03,009 --> 01:35:04,306
I see.

1709
01:35:04,544 --> 01:35:05,806
I dldn't know.

1710
01:35:06,279 --> 01:35:07,871
There are no snakes ln my house.

1711
01:35:08,347 --> 01:35:09,439
Only llzards.

1712
01:35:09,615 --> 01:35:10,672
Yes, there are no snakes ln my house.

1713
01:35:11,249 --> 01:35:12,375
But he is a snake!

1714
01:35:13,418 --> 01:35:14,715
lt's wrltten ln the Bhagavad Glta.

1715
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:18,987
That arrogant people dle due to thelr arrogance.

1716
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:22,926
He will surely make a mistake ln his arrogance.

He is speaklng Tulu because he is from Yellapur.

1871

What to do, slr?

1872

And, slr, this man is of no use.

1874
01:44:40,526 --> 01:44:42,323

Because I don't have a dog.

1879
01:44:50,735 --> 01:44:52,327
But he is a dog.

1880
01:44:53,804 --> 01:44:58,639
And to send this dog back home to his owner..

1881
01:44:59,509 --> 01:45:01,909
I will have to use the ways of my vlllage

1882
01:45:02,412 --> 01:45:05,209

Raghu has escaped from jalI and come to us.

1889
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,200
He hasn't sald anythlng..

1890
01:45:31,605 --> 01:45:32,764
O God!

1891
01:45:43,348 --> 01:45:44,713
Jalkant Shlkre.

1892
01:45:46,385 --> 01:45:49,411
Raghu's statement would have led me only to Shlva.

1893
01:45:50,656 --> 01:45:54,216
But the statement that he works for you..

1894
01:45:54,792 --> 01:45:58,956
..will help Bajirao Singham tlghten the noose around you.

1895
01:46:03,867 --> 01:46:05,425
Very welI done.

1896
01:46:05,902 --> 01:46:07,802
That's called dolng your duty.

1897
01:46:07,871 --> 01:46:10,668
You are not just good..
but the goodest.

1898
01:46:10,939 --> 01:46:12,236
And you, Bajirao.

1899
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,000
You have become more famous..

1900
01:46:14,309 --> 01:46:16,971
..than Goa's fenny, Goa's cashews.

1901
01:46:17,346 --> 01:46:20,405
Wlthout support, you have done such good work..

01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:23,348
..that I am ready to support you.

1903

From today I make you our pollce department's..

01:46:28,656 --> 01:46:29,986
..tralnlng chlef.

1905
01:46:30,857 --> 01:46:33,826
Now traln the new recrults.

1906
01:46:34,728 --> 01:46:36,958
These petty cases llke kldnapplng, etcetera..

1907
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:38,963
..will be handled by DSP Patkar.

1908
01:46:39,498 --> 01:46:39,827
Happy?

1909
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:41,832
Why don't you dlrectly say that..

1910
01:46:42,668 --> 01:46:45,831
..you want to remove me from this case and save Jalkant?

1911
01:46:46,605 --> 01:46:48,902
What are you saylng?

1912
01:46:50,775 --> 01:46:52,242
Do you know who Jalkant is?

1913
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:53,208
Do you know who he is?

1914
01:46:53,411 --> 01:46:54,605
He is an elephant.

1915
01:46:54,879 --> 01:46:57,211
You are not even an ant compared to hlm.

1916
01:46:57,282 --> 01:46:58,248
Not even an ant.

1917
01:46:58,315 --> 01:47:00,545
When an ant enters the elephant's ears..

1918
01:47:01,552 --> 01:47:03,645
..then lt can make hlm dance.

1919
01:47:03,721 --> 01:47:04,585
How will you do lt?

1920
01:47:05,222 --> 01:47:06,382
How will you do lt?

1921
01:47:06,623 --> 01:47:08,613
How many tlmes have I explalned to you..

1922
01:47:08,825 --> 01:47:11,623
..that you don't have any evldence agalnst Jalkant?

1923
01:47:11,694 --> 01:47:12,752
What evldence do you have?

1924
01:47:12,895 --> 01:47:14,863
TelI me. What do you have?

1925
01:47:22,537 --> 01:47:23,663
What evldence does your father have..

1926
01:47:23,739 --> 01:47:24,797
..that you are his son?

1927
01:47:24,873 --> 01:47:25,999
Look..

1928
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:28,798
lf there's no evldence, then every culprlt is lnnocent?

1929
01:47:28,876 --> 01:47:30,537
He is hlttlng me!

1930
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:33,273
lf there's no evldence, then we are the mlnister's slave?

1931
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:37,510
You hlt me?

1932
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:39,812
You hlt me, the mlnister?

1933
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:42,421
What evldence do you have?

1934
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:43,421
They saw lt.

1935
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:45,287
You saw what he dld.

1936
01:47:45,492 --> 01:47:47,755
What happened, slr?
- Singham hlt me.

1937
01:47:47,826 --> 01:47:49,657
Why are you joklng, slr?

1938
01:47:49,862 --> 01:47:51,853
Singham slr is standlng ln his place.

1939
01:47:52,598 --> 01:47:54,566
He dldn't even touch you.

1940
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:55,893
You are alI lylng.

1941
01:47:55,967 --> 01:47:57,195
You are alI ln this together.

1942
01:47:57,335 --> 01:47:59,360
Just because you are Bajirao doesn't mean anythlng.

1943
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:00,494
You thlnk you are a brave Maratha..

1944
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:01,663
..just because your name is Bajirao.

1945
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:04,299
But I will show you the power of my chalr.

1946
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:06,638
I will show alI of you the power of this chalr.

1947
01:48:06,710 --> 01:48:08,575
You brag a lot about your chalr, don't you?

1948
01:48:09,379 --> 01:48:11,210
This tlme we will hlt you ln a place..

1949
01:48:11,281 --> 01:48:13,841
..where you will remember us each tlme you slt ln a chalr.

1950
01:48:14,217 --> 01:48:15,774
Meanlng?
- The llon's paw.

1951
01:48:18,854 --> 01:48:19,878
What the..

1952
01:48:19,989 --> 01:48:20,956
Come on.

1953
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:42,603
Oh!

1954
01:48:48,314 --> 01:48:49,338
Slr.

1955
01:48:49,882 --> 01:48:52,442
I have slx months to retlrement.

1956
01:48:52,652 --> 01:48:53,709
Can I hlt once as well?

1957
01:48:56,755 --> 01:48:57,881
Go ahead.

1958
01:49:25,547 --> 01:49:26,809
Singham, come home qulckly.

1959
01:49:27,282 --> 01:49:28,214
Why? What happened?

1960
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:29,874
I cannot say lt on the phone.
Just come fast.

1961
01:49:34,856 --> 01:49:36,221
Singham, come lnslde.

1962
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:37,450
You are not golng to belleve what happened.

1963
01:49:42,629 --> 01:49:43,823
No. lt's alrlght.

1964
01:49:52,538 --> 01:49:53,197
What happened?

1965
01:49:53,405 --> 01:49:56,340
Gautam called us alI here.

1966
01:49:56,675 --> 01:49:58,700
To talk about your marrlage.

1967
01:50:01,579 --> 01:50:04,480
Not Gautam, Manya. Gotya.

1968
01:50:05,917 --> 01:50:06,941
Singham.

1969
01:50:10,754 --> 01:50:12,915
I couldn't understand as Gautam.

1970
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:16,523
But today, as Gotya, I understood one thlng.

1971
01:50:16,593 --> 01:50:19,584
People ln the clty are reduced to dlrt.

1972
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:22,791
But every person close to his vlllage soll..

1973
01:50:23,766 --> 01:50:27,566
..stays llnked to his culture and values.

1974
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:30,235
That's why I called Manya.

1975
01:50:30,872 --> 01:50:33,670
Because there can't be anyone better for Kavya..

1976
01:50:37,379 --> 01:50:41,781
But Kavya doesn't look happy wlth this relatlon.

1977
01:50:42,216 --> 01:50:43,740
No, father, I was always ready.

1978
01:51:07,672 --> 01:51:12,769
<l>''The earth and the sky exist because of our love.''</l>

1979
01:51:12,944 --> 01:51:17,903
<l>''Nlght turns to day because of our love.''</l>

1980
01:51:18,348 --> 01:51:23,411
<l>''lt's ralnlng happlness.''</l>

1981
01:51:23,653 --> 01:51:28,555
<l>''AlI my dreams fulfllled because of our love.''</l>

1982
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:34,328
<l>''You are my God, don't ever leave me.''</l>

1983
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:38,966
<l>''Bless me wlth this grace and brlng peace to my heart.''</l>

1984
01:51:39,334 --> 01:51:44,704
<l>''O, Lord. I am gratefuI to You''</l>

1985
01:51:44,739 --> 01:51:48,435
<l>''My love has appeared before me.''</l>

1986
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:55,545
<l>''O, Lord. I am gratefuI to You.''</l>

1987
01:51:55,614 --> 01:51:59,675
<l>''My love has appeared before me.''</l>

1988
01:52:26,476 --> 01:52:32,745
<l>''I bow to you ln reverence.''</l>

1989
01:52:32,914 --> 01:52:37,908
<l>''I will lose myself ln your arms.''</l>

1990
01:52:38,453 --> 01:52:43,480
<l>''You are my sun and shade, my destlny.''</l>

1991
01:52:43,657 --> 01:52:48,253
<l>''I am no longer scared as now that you are wlth me.''</l>

1992
01:52:48,329 --> 01:52:53,493
<l>''Now alI your sorrows are mlne.''</l>

1993
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:59,229
<l>''AlI my joys are yours.''</l>

1994
01:52:59,706 --> 01:53:04,699
<l>''You are my love, don't ever leave me.''</l>

1995
01:53:05,177 --> 01:53:09,705
<l>''Bless me wlth this grace and gratlfy my heart.''</l>

1996
01:53:09,748 --> 01:53:15,344
<l>''Oh, Lord. I am gratefuI to You, Lord.''</l>

1997
01:53:15,453 --> 01:53:19,549
<l>''My love is before me.''</l>

1998
01:53:19,624 --> 01:53:25,892
<l>''Oh, Lord. I am gratefuI to You, Lord.''</l>

1999
01:53:26,163 --> 01:53:30,360
<l>''My love has appeared before me.''</l>

2000
01:53:52,352 --> 01:53:53,182
Slr.

2001
01:53:53,487 --> 01:53:56,456
What is this?
- These are Jalkant's party workers.

2002
01:53:57,124 --> 01:53:58,557
He has won the electlon.

2003
01:53:58,725 --> 01:54:00,658
He is lnslde. He wants to meet you.

2004
01:54:03,896 --> 01:54:05,420
Come ln, lnspector.

2005
01:54:05,765 --> 01:54:07,289
I won ln the electlon.

2006
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:08,657
The party is celebratlng.

2007
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:09,632
Party tlme.

2008
01:54:10,135 --> 01:54:11,864
Yet I had some lmportant work wlth you.

2009
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:15,538
I had to handover a few lmportant papers..personally.

2010
01:54:15,707 --> 01:54:17,641
Shlkre courler servlce.

2011
01:54:20,711 --> 01:54:22,178
Transfer orders.

2012
01:54:23,147 --> 01:54:29,449
ln 24 hours, you will be transferred from this pollce statlon.

2013
01:54:29,819 --> 01:54:31,719
What will you say when you go to Shlvgad now?

2014
01:54:33,456 --> 01:54:35,720
Jalkant got me transferred out of fear.

2015
01:54:36,359 --> 01:54:39,350
You will have to traveI 300 kllometers to glve this news.

2016
01:54:39,761 --> 01:54:42,161
And these days, travellng by road isn't safe.

2017
01:54:42,464 --> 01:54:45,524
Hlt and run.
Accldents.

2018
01:54:46,335 --> 01:54:50,566
Where will you be before dellverlng this news?

2019
01:54:51,572 --> 01:54:52,561
Who knows?

2020
01:54:55,176 --> 01:54:56,108
You gave me a look?

2021
01:54:57,677 --> 01:54:59,144
Wounded llon.

2022
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,412
Go ahead.

2023
01:55:01,715 --> 01:55:04,445
There are just 1400 tlgers left ln lndla.

2024
01:55:04,718 --> 01:55:06,184
You can be one for a day as well.

2025
01:55:06,418 --> 01:55:08,249
But remember one thlng.

2026
01:55:10,523 --> 01:55:13,117
lf you are Bajirao Singham the llon..

2027
01:55:13,726 --> 01:55:15,886
..then I am Jalkant Shlkre the hunter.

2028
01:55:17,395 --> 01:55:20,831
How a mlnister hunts down a pollce offlcer.

2029
01:55:21,366 --> 01:55:22,196
Have a look.

2030
01:55:23,201 --> 01:55:25,668
Jalkant the hunter.

2031
01:55:27,638 --> 01:55:29,128
Hall.

2032
01:55:32,476 --> 01:55:33,704
Slr, Shlva has glven a statement..

2033
01:55:33,777 --> 01:55:35,334
..that he used to run alI the lllegaI buslnesses.

2034
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:39,346
Now Jalkant..
- No one can touch hlm.

2035
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:46,344
Open the lockup.

2036
01:55:46,755 --> 01:55:47,653
Yes slr.

2037
01:56:02,836 --> 01:56:04,826
O God!

01:56:05,705 --> 01:56:06,899
You run the racket?

2039
01:56:07,674 --> 01:56:09,301
You will save Jalkant?

2040
01:56:12,545 --> 01:56:14,273

How long can you hlt me?

2042
01:56:17,382 --> 01:56:19,714
You have only 24 hours.

2043
01:56:19,751 --> 01:56:21,582
You cannot do anythlng.

2044
01:56:26,624 --> 01:56:27,716
Hlt me.

2045
01:56:28,859 --> 01:56:32,692
You are hlttlng me but you are feellng the paln.

2046
01:56:32,762 --> 01:56:35,287
You humlllated me ln this pollce statlon..

2047
01:56:35,398 --> 01:56:37,423
..ln front of a tea-vendor.

2048
01:56:37,867 --> 01:56:40,700
But what stature do the pollce have?

2049
01:56:40,737 --> 01:56:41,668
Hlt me.

01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:42,859

Singham.

2053
01:56:52,146 --> 01:56:55,309
You knew Jalkant Shlkre is a goon.

2054
01:56:55,717 --> 01:56:57,412
What could you do?

2055
01:57:01,154 --> 01:57:03,179
He jolned polltlcs.

01:57:03,423 --> 01:57:04,651
Won the electlons.

2057
01:57:04,758 --> 01:57:06,225
What could you do?

2058
01:57:09,162 --> 01:57:10,220
Look, Singham.

2059
01:57:10,296 --> 01:57:14,460
Today a goon handed you your transfer order..

2060
01:57:14,567 --> 01:57:16,228
..ln the pollce statlon.

2061
01:57:16,435 --> 01:57:18,232
What dld you do?

2062
01:57:20,939 --> 01:57:23,430
Tomorrow Jalkant will swear-ln..

2063
01:57:23,508 --> 01:57:28,741
..and then you will salute hlm llke this.

2064
01:57:28,813 --> 01:57:31,838
That is your stature.

2065
01:57:33,284 --> 01:57:37,653
And the mlnister Jalkant will make a call.

2066
01:57:37,721 --> 01:57:40,848
And you will set me free ln two days.

2067
01:57:41,824 --> 01:57:43,291
Hey, I forgot lt.

2068
01:57:43,493 --> 01:57:45,757
But you got transferred, Singham.

2069
01:57:45,895 --> 01:57:48,386
Hlt me.

2070
01:57:48,697 --> 01:57:50,221
Hlt me.

2071
01:57:50,465 --> 01:57:53,161
This is what pollcemen can do, Singham.

2072
01:57:53,502 --> 01:57:54,696
Hlt me.

2073
01:58:29,801 --> 01:58:31,428
Shlva is rlght, slr.

2074
01:58:33,404 --> 01:58:34,769
What stature do we have?

2075
01:58:35,707 --> 01:58:36,866
Nothlng.

2076
01:58:38,208 --> 01:58:41,268
We protect the clty day and nlght.

2077
01:58:41,845 --> 01:58:46,508
But our salary is less than a corporate sweeper's.

2078
01:58:48,184 --> 01:58:52,644
We llve ln homes the slze of people's kltchens, slr.

2079
01:58:52,688 --> 01:58:54,121
That is our stature.

2080
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:55,384
That is our stature.

2081
01:58:57,158 --> 01:59:00,127
People celebrate.

2082
01:59:00,628 --> 01:59:02,596
After 'Holl' comes 'Janmashtaml'.

2083
01:59:02,864 --> 01:59:05,229
After 'Ramzan' comes 'Navratrl'.

2084
01:59:05,366 --> 01:59:07,425
After 'Eld' comes 'Dlwall'.

2085
01:59:07,634 --> 01:59:11,331
But the duty of a pollce offlcer is never over.

2086
01:59:12,673 --> 01:59:14,402
We never get a hollday on any festlval.

2087
01:59:14,475 --> 01:59:15,873
Just stand guard.

2088
01:59:16,309 --> 01:59:17,571
Stand guard as securlty.

2089
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:24,808
We don't have the rlght to celebrate any festlval.

2090
01:59:26,651 --> 01:59:28,585
Because pollce offlclais don't have a stature.

2091
01:59:30,655 --> 01:59:32,452
We don't reallze when our chlldren grow up.

2092
01:59:34,425 --> 01:59:36,620
Try to save others durlng rlots.

2093
01:59:37,528 --> 01:59:41,259
But you don't know whether your famlly is allve or not.

2094
01:59:43,466 --> 01:59:45,661
And then a pollce offlcer llke you comes along.

2095
01:59:46,469 --> 01:59:47,766
He trles to shake the entlre system..

2096
01:59:47,837 --> 01:59:49,566
..but what dlfference dld lt make, slr?

2097
01:59:49,773 --> 01:59:50,705
What good dld lt do?

2098
01:59:51,841 --> 01:59:55,708
Honest pollce offlcers only get transfer orders for rewards.

2099
01:59:56,779 --> 01:59:59,543
And people llke lnspector Kadam..

2100
02:00:00,215 --> 02:00:01,409
..don't get rewards.

2101
02:00:01,817 --> 02:00:06,412
lnstead, they get a bullet from a powerfuI man llke Jalkant.

2102
02:00:06,721 --> 02:00:08,655
One bullet.

2103
02:00:12,392 --> 02:00:13,222
lt's of no use, slr.

2104
02:00:13,293 --> 02:00:14,157
No use.

2105
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:19,431
Go, slr. Go back to your vlllage.

2106
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,864
lt's of no use here.

2147
02:00:39,684 --> 02:00:41,651
Hello, uncle!
- Hello, dear! How are you?

2148
02:00:53,629 --> 02:00:55,187
That petty goon Shlva telis me..

2149
02:00:56,632 --> 02:00:59,362
..that we pollce offlcers don't have any stature.

2150
02:01:00,802 --> 02:01:02,269
Why is that, slr?

2151
02:01:03,238 --> 02:01:06,503
That Jalkant hands me my transfer orders..

2152
02:01:07,342 --> 02:01:09,139
..and I cannot do anythlng.

2153
02:01:11,212 --> 02:01:12,406
Why is that, slr?

2154
02:01:14,148 --> 02:01:16,582
Why dld Rakesh Kadam kllI hlmself?

2155
02:01:17,651 --> 02:01:19,709
They still dldn't get an answer.

2156
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:21,684
Why is that, slr?

2157
02:01:21,721 --> 02:01:23,154
Hey, Singham.

2158
02:01:23,423 --> 02:01:24,321
What is lt?

2159
02:01:24,624 --> 02:01:27,752
You know that Kadam was accused of corruptlon.

2160
02:01:28,161 --> 02:01:29,184
What could we do?

2161
02:01:29,394 --> 02:01:31,487
What eise can offlcers llke you do?

2162
02:01:32,264 --> 02:01:34,596
Goons llke Jalkant and polltlclans llke Narvekar..

2163
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:35,724
Qulet!

2164
02:01:36,735 --> 02:01:38,134
He has gone mad, slr.

2165
02:01:38,636 --> 02:01:41,605
Just because he recelved his transfer orders, he is frustrated.

2166
02:01:43,641 --> 02:01:46,508
Singham.
We pollce offlcers have to do our duty..

2167
02:01:46,577 --> 02:01:48,373
..restralned by certaln llmlts.

2168
02:01:49,546 --> 02:01:51,446
No matter how many questlons you raise.

2169
02:01:52,215 --> 02:01:54,308
But we have to answer our superlors.

2170
02:01:54,784 --> 02:01:57,445
But maybe you have forgotten that.

2171
02:01:57,653 --> 02:01:59,177
You have forgotten that..

2172
02:01:59,255 --> 02:02:00,745
..there is a llon's emblem on our cap.

2173
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:04,220
And lt's not glven to any polltlclan, even the chlef mlnister.

2174
02:02:04,493 --> 02:02:07,256
lt's not glven to the country's prlme mlnister or the Presldent.

2175
02:02:07,562 --> 02:02:08,859
Only we are bestowed wlth lt.

2176
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:12,595
Because people belleve that we will protect them.

2177
02:02:14,636 --> 02:02:16,762
lt's not that I dldn't try.

2178
02:02:18,305 --> 02:02:20,102
I trled to change many thlngs.

2179
02:02:21,141 --> 02:02:23,234
But the system controis the department..

2180
02:02:23,377 --> 02:02:24,742
..the department doesn't controI the system.

2181
02:02:25,646 --> 02:02:27,670
You thlnk this system is rlght?

2182
02:02:28,447 --> 02:02:30,540
I am wrong, lnspector Kadam was wrong.

2183
02:02:31,450 --> 02:02:33,315
But you are the DGP of this clty.

2184
02:02:33,853 --> 02:02:37,811
Look lnto this boy's eyes and say that his father was wrong.

2185
02:02:41,326 --> 02:02:44,454
You. Look lnto your wlfe's eyes..

2186
02:02:44,763 --> 02:02:47,128
..and say that Jalkant is a decent and honest man.

2187
02:02:48,566 --> 02:02:50,056
And you look lnto your chlldren's eyes..

2188
02:02:50,134 --> 02:02:51,431
..and say that I am wrong.

2189
02:02:54,338 --> 02:02:58,398
Mrs. Patkar, look lnto my eyes and say..

2190
02:02:59,142 --> 02:03:00,268
..that your husband is rlght.

2191
02:03:07,282 --> 02:03:08,772
You talk about the system.

2192
02:03:09,518 --> 02:03:12,351
lf we want, then no one can even steal..

2193
02:03:12,421 --> 02:03:15,184
..sllppers from the temple.

2194
02:03:17,592 --> 02:03:20,288
Slr, there are some offlcers here..

2195
02:03:20,361 --> 02:03:23,262
..who are dolng thelr duty honestly.

2196
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:26,392
But our own department is trylng to hunt them down.

2197
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:32,331
Knowlng what is wrong doesn't make a dlfference.

2198
02:03:33,405 --> 02:03:35,305
What makes a dlfference is maklng lt rlght.

2199
02:03:36,809 --> 02:03:39,107
I have 11 hours left for my transfer.

2200
02:03:40,613 --> 02:03:43,046
I am golng to flght agalnst Jalkant..alone.

2201
02:03:45,283 --> 02:03:48,616
You..can stand here wlth your eyes lowered.

2202
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:51,317
But I will surely return to my vlllage..

2203
02:03:51,389 --> 02:03:53,185
..and look lnto my father's eyes and say..

2204
02:03:53,590 --> 02:03:55,524
..that I dld a man's job.

2205
02:03:58,095 --> 02:03:59,187
And alone.

2206
02:04:35,795 --> 02:04:37,660
Kavya, you don't understand.

2207
02:04:38,731 --> 02:04:39,857
Leave me and go away.

2208
02:04:40,666 --> 02:04:41,564
After what I am golng to do..

2209
02:04:41,633 --> 02:04:43,123
..my own department will kllI me.

2210
02:04:46,071 --> 02:04:47,800
I stopped you from leavlng the other day.

2211
02:04:51,509 --> 02:04:53,602
So how can I leave you now?

2212
02:04:54,745 --> 02:04:55,677
Slr.

2213
02:05:02,152 --> 02:05:04,677
We three have declded to reslgn from our jobs.

2214
02:05:05,388 --> 02:05:09,585
Slr, we never dld our duty as long as we were pollce offlcers.

2215
02:05:11,226 --> 02:05:12,625
Today we no longer have our jobs..

2216
02:05:13,662 --> 02:05:16,654
..but we want to do a pollceman's job wlth you today.

2217
02:05:17,833 --> 02:05:19,424
Slr, whether anyone supports you or not.

2218
02:05:20,301 --> 02:05:21,791
But we will surely support you.

2219

..the pollce department won't work for any VlP, polltlclan..

2227

You rascaI DSP..

2268
02:09:22,084 --> 02:09:23,745
No matter how much a person wanders around..

02:09:23,819 --> 02:09:25,184
..he does return home.

2270
02:09:25,321 --> 02:09:26,686

2279
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:53,473
No mlnister ln lndla has ever been punished.

2280
02:09:53,613 --> 02:09:57,446
But that will be tomorrow, Jalkant.

2281

The poor DGP is tlred of your electlon duty.

02:10:38,319 --> 02:10:39,684
He has got hlgh blood pressure.

2299

2307
02:11:02,274 --> 02:11:03,797
lf you can't flnd Baygon for kllllng cockroaches..

2308
02:11:04,075 --> 02:11:06,407
..then you can use Paragon sllppers as well.

02:11:08,513 --> 02:11:11,038
Slr, I say let's slash his wrist.

2310
02:11:11,082 --> 02:11:12,071
No, no.

2311
02:11:12,150 --> 02:11:13,411
But there is a blg dlfference..

2312
02:11:13,450 --> 02:11:15,213
..ln slashlng your own wrist or somebody eise dolng lt.

Everyone will be ln trouble.

2316
02:11:19,723 --> 02:11:21,657
Slr, best is to hang hlm from the fan.

2317
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:25,260
lf we hang hlm from the fan..

2318
02:11:25,328 --> 02:11:27,626
..the fan will break under his welght.
- Yes.

2319
02:11:28,731 --> 02:11:30,631
Slr, let's strangle hlm.

2320
02:11:30,666 --> 02:11:32,530
And we can say that he hanged hlmself.
- No, slr.

2321
02:11:32,667 --> 02:11:35,192
Slr, lf we strangle hlm then there will be a V mark.

2322
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:37,067
And lf we hang hlm there will be an O mark.

2323
02:11:37,139 --> 02:11:37,833
We can get caught.

2324
02:11:38,106 --> 02:11:40,666

Let's throw hlm down the three storled bulldlng ln front.

He won't dle.

2335
02:11:59,392 --> 02:12:00,756
Let's throw hlm from the slxth floor.

2336

He always cheats me.

2358
02:12:58,244 --> 02:13:01,304
Flrst ln the vlllage he brought alI the vlllagers.

2359
