173
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:34,029
It's not an Aadhar Card.
It is a Green Card

174
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,672
Talk to Trump quickly.
Start my Visa processing urgently

175
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,029
Please do it.

176
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,553
Trump isn't some village politician.

177
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:44,429
He is America's President.
- Whatever.

178
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,073
Kusa, why are you so crazy
about America?

179
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,229
Why wouldn't I be?

180
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:49,989
If we steal here,
it's just three crores.

181
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,069
If we steal in America
it's going to be three crore dollars.

182
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:54,909
If those dollars --
- I Understood.

183
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:57,669
Sign this file. I'll do my work.

184
00:18:58,629 --> 00:18:59,749
Here.
- Ok.

185
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:06,229
I'm going to America.

186
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,029
Bro!

187
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,789
They cut our bag in the dark.

188
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,309
What's up dude?

189
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,549
Hey Fatso, where are you going?

190
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,433
I am going home
as my stomach hurts, dude

191
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:44,629
Remove the bundles of cash
near your belly and it won't hurt

192
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:45,549
What?

193
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:48,829
We just know to steal.
We don't know the return policy

194
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,149
Along with stealing,
I also know how to hit

195
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,629
Hey! that's our money.

196
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:26,709
Bro.

197
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:44,829
Beat more.

198
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,309
This is correct for him.

199
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:55,029
[ Screams in pain ]

200
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,989
Here, take it.

201
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,349
Take it out.
- Take it.

202
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,269
I won't leave you.

203
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,312
Today in the midnight
- Don't leave him.

204
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:16,549
Cut him to pieces.
- 2 November 2016

205
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,069
Break his bones.

206
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:25,989
500 and 1000 rupees currency notes

207
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:29,869
Will not be in the legal tender.

208
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:36,669
Printing them will be against the law.

209
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:45,069
Old 500 and 1000 notes
are to be exchanged

210
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:47,309
Hey, move.
Brother you too.

211
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:50,509
You were so strong-willed until now.

212
00:21:50,749 --> 00:21:52,429
This man brought
a lot of change in you.

213
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:54,949
Change isn't in us but the notes.
Let's go

214
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:58,109
Kusa, 500 and 1000 rupee notes
are not valid anymore

215
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,189
Government has just declared it.
- What?

216
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,952
That man had destroyed
all our dreams

217
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,949
What do we do with these notes?
- Shove them up.

218
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:25,389
Hey, check if he is dead or alive

219
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:35,869
Brother.

220
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:37,909
What?

221
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:54,749
You - You...
- Yes, I'm Kusa.

222
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,969
You are still alive.

223
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:58,869
You thought I was dead?

224
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,069
No.

225
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,072
Why do you say that instead of feeling
happy for having met after so long?

226
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,549
How would I feel happy?

227
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:07,309
Do you know what happened
after the blast that day?

228
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:12,149
That day in the fire accident,
I fell on the police station.

229
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:15,789
Along with the station, the houses
and farms close to it burned down.

230
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:20,029
As it happened because of me.
They put me in Junivelle jail.

231
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,069
Getting to know I am an actor,

232
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:24,069
The jailer and his associates

233
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,789
They made me do dance and dramas

234
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:29,669
They tortured me.

235
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:35,909
This was not for one or two days.
- For some years

236
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:40,629
Everyone used me like an ATM machine.

237
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,509
Why are you so frustrated?
- Why wouldn't I be?

238
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:46,029
I thought you were
dead until last night.

239
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:49,869
Being alive, you didn't even
try to find out if I was dead or alive

240
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:52,589
Don't get furious.
Listen to me.

241
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,869
The officer from the Fire Department

242
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:58,789
Saw me lying unconscious
and took me to the hospital.

243
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,309
It took me 10 days to recover.

244
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:04,509
As I had no one, he took care of me.

245
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,032
I listened to him...

246
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:09,629
I studied well and
became a Bank Manager

247
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:13,709
Everything was going well for you.
Why did you fall under my car?

248
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,669
My time was running bad.

249
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,709
What was so troublesome?

250
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:18,669
My humanity.

251
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:23,069
It looks good only in textbooks. If
we have it, it will teach us a lesson.

252
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,669
The same happened to me.

253
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:38,349
Where do I get money
for alcohol now?

254
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:39,869
I have to find some fool

255
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:43,709
What? Tablets again?
I can't do it anymore. Die...

256
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,389
What happened?
- That doctor prescribed tablets again, sir.

257
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:51,469
I have nothing more to sell
for my mother.

258
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:54,989
Am I working at the Secretariat?
I am just a Security Guard.

259
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:58,109
Let her go... Old lady.
- Hold it.

260
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,189
How much will it cost?
- 1500 rupees sir.

261
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:02,749
I can buy a full bottle with it.

262
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:05,272
Take it.

263
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:07,589
Sir, you are a saviour.

264
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:11,589
Do you know why I give you money
without questioning the reason?

265
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:13,109
It's for mom

266
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:15,989
And I don't have one.
Take care.

267
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:18,749
- Did you get all the documents?
- Yes sir.

268
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,789
Sir... Sir... Sir...
- Mr. Rambabu.

269
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:24,192
I can't carry your responsibility, Let
me carry your briefcase at least, sir

270
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,189
No. You are the Bank's
Assistant Manager. Not mine.

271
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:28,669
Come.
- You are so humane.

272
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:30,669
Have to learn a lot from you.

273
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,629
Mr. Juthada, you sign the register
in the morning and leave.

274
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,269
We can't see you until
the next morning.

275
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:42,109
Your signature is in the register but
there is no result in the recovery.

276
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:44,669
I keep getting mails
from the Head Office.

277
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:48,469
You keep getting mails and I keep
getting piles from roaming on the bike

278
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,513
Whoever has a car and bike
loan from us, are never home.

279
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:53,913
They are roaming outside. It's quite
difficult to do the recovery, sir

280
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:57,229
It's going to start.
- Shut up! I will do the recovery before evening.

281
00:25:57,619 --> 00:25:58,989
All the best.
- Thank you sir.

282
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:09,029
Virgini.

283
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:25,069
Mr. Rajini,
you can arrange those papers later.

284
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,389
Adjust your saree first.

285
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:30,469
How many times do I have
to tell you, Mr. Rambabu?

286
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,789
She is V.A Rajini. Not Virgini.

287
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,709
It's the same after joining.

288
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:38,109
The joy in joining
isn't there in separating.

289
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:42,229
Yes. Why did you call
so many times at night?

290
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,589
To come to your place...

291
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,789
My place? Why?

292
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:51,309
Lots of doubts in the audit files.

293
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,469
Thought of showing you my accounts.

294
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:57,149
Send them to my cabin.
I will have a look.

295
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,789
Just the accounts?

296
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:02,229
He left. Close the account.

297
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,749
I too have my place and a phone.

298
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,549
Didn't you remember me?
- You have everything,

299
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:10,500
Except the calling bell.

300
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:14,869
Sir.

301
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:16,989
Mother Teresa's father is here.

302
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:19,189
What?
- I told you earlier

303
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:20,553
There's a guy preceding Mother Teresa

304
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:22,469
Oh... Call him in.
- Okay sir.

305
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:25,989
Sir, He is calling you

306
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,429
Greetings.
- Greetings.

307
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:29,309
Sit.

308
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:33,109
I am from Kudbullapur.
Despite having a bank there,

309
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,509
Do you know why I came here?

310
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,974
Listening about your humanity.
- Tell me.

311
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,989
What do you want?

312
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,509
There was a drinking water lake
in our area.

313
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,589
But now It dried up.

314
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:49,189
We have to fill our thirst with tears.

315
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,869
We wish to renovate the lake

316
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:56,229
And fill it with drinking water again.

317
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,229
It will cost upto one crore.

318
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:05,109
You have to give us loan
and eliminate water scarcity.

319
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:09,629
I am pleading you.
- Please. You are elder to me.

320
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:14,069
Here are my land documents, sir

321
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,972
Please keep these documents.

322
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,149
I have checked already.
It is valued at two crores.

323
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:18,669
We can loan a crore easily.

324
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:21,469
People these days
don't even bother about family

325
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,669
But you want to help a few
putting yourself in debt.

326
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:25,909
I will start your
loan process immediately.

327
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:29,149
You should be blessed.
I'm leave.

328
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:49,109
Oh shit.

329
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:10,632
Coffee?

330
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,469
Had 20 already.

331
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:15,509
When were you supposed to come?

332
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:18,349
I have called and texted
like a zillion times.

333
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:19,629
Sorry, Priya.

334
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:21,269
It's the end of the financial year.

335
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:24,429
Had to refer accounts at the Bank...

336
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:27,192
I have been waiting to tell you
it's the end of our journey.

337
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,229
I said it. I am leaving. Bye.

338
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:29,989
Priya.

339
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:31,429
Priya.

340
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:34,189
Just once.
- How many times will you say that?

341
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:37,789
Priya, everyone is staring at us.
- Let them.

342
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:40,229
Every idiot has to know
how much you torture me

343
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:44,909
Ma'am, why are you torturing
this innocent guy for being late?

344
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:47,149
Being lovers, you have to adjust.

345
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:50,269
Hey blackie, Who told you
we were lovers?

346
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,709
He is my customer.
- Customer?

347
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:53,869
Don't worry.

348
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:56,069
She is from the Subhamasthu
Marriage Bureau.

349
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,469
I left my marriage responsibility to her.
- Understood?

350
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,709
Mind your business.

351
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:02,869
Priya, listen to me.
- What?

352
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:05,709
My father did 90 wedding
in this marriage bureau.

353
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:09,229
I challenged him to make it to 100
by finishing the rest.

354
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:11,229
Nine were quite easy for me.

355
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:13,749
I am unable to finish yours
since three months.

356
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:16,992
We can get an alliance for
Salman Khan too but not for you.

357
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:20,749
You know my problems.
- They are not problems but complaints.

358
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:23,349
You said one girl was not traditional,
as she didn't wear anklets.

359
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:25,709
The next girl didn't know culture,
as she didn't apply eyeliner.

360
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:28,629
One of them was too fast
and the other too talkative.

361
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:31,189
I finally got you the perfect girl
and you are late.

362
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,069
That girl left.
- She doesn't have patience

363
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:37,629
You are the only one to name flaws
without looking at the girl.

364
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:39,952
I lost my patience. Leave me.
Please.

365
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:40,829
Priya...

366
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:43,749
Don't say that. We will try hard
one last time

367
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,149
Okay. This is your last chance.

368
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,869
But you have to finalize
one of the girls I show. That's all.

369
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:03,192
We raised her with a lot of values.

370
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:07,229
She can cook everything.

371
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:12,269
I don't drink coffee.
- I know.

372
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:14,389
That is why I brought you milk.

373
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,749
Thanks.

374
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:24,389
Are you fine with her?

375
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:27,909
She is too classy.
If she was a little informal...

376
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:32,509
Is it? I was controlling her,
as you might not like it.

377
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,949
Come on, dear.
Show him.

378
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,709
"Why?
- Why do you ask?"

379
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:48,629
"I am local for sure.
I am local for sure."

380
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:53,389
"All the accessories I use are tacky"

381
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:58,389
"I am local for sure.
I am local for sure."

382
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:03,269
"All the accessories I use are tacky"

383
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,309
"I am local for sure."

384
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:09,349
Mass. Mass.

385
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:14,829
If you want to talk to her personally,
go ahea.

386
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:23,069
I got him till here.

387
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:25,829
See that he doesn't give any excuse.

388
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,709
This is my world.
This is my family.

389
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,229
What about you?

390
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:32,909
There's nothing much about him.

391
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:35,909
He lost his parents during childhood.

392
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:39,469
He is looking for a mother
in the girl he will marry.

393
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:44,589
Every dream he has ever dreamt
is about his wife.

394
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,749
He will become your mother
if you are unwell...

395
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:51,829
A good friend if you feel low...

396
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:55,989
Support to your family
through any trouble...

397
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:02,429
He will not let your put your head down
except while he makes the three knots.

398
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:07,429
Don't think anymore, Sravani.
Just accept it.

399
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:10,909
I'm okay with him.
- FInally, I could finish my target.

400
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:12,549
Do you accept it?

401
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:18,189
What? Mom is getting operated?

402
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:20,989
Sir, Sir, Sir.

403
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:24,069
My engagement date has been fixed.

404
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:28,269
Priya stopped calling me.

405
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:32,229
I would be tensed
when she called daily

406
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:36,949
But as I don't get calls from her,
I felt I am missing something.

407
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,589
Only when she went far from me
I realized how close I have gotten to her.

408
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:51,309
She looks beautiful.
- Arrange all the stuff.

409
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:55,869
[ Indistinct chatter ]

410
00:34:04,924 --> 00:34:06,389
Sorry.

411
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:15,789
On the day of engagement, I felt happy
looking at Priya rather than the bride

412
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:18,989
Hi.

413
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,349
Hi.

414
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:24,669
It is our sheer luck.

415
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,349
It is shocking that our son-in-law, with such
desirable qualities hasn't been married until now.

416
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:35,629
Nothing like that. Everywhere we go,
he is frank and honest about his opinion.

417
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:37,909
That is his negative point.

418
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:42,029
No, uncle. Speaking from your heart
is very difficult.

419
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:44,029
That's a rare quality.

420
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:46,189
I love you.

421
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,269
Look...

422
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:51,229
How he is expressing his love for you
in front of everyone.

423
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,747
That wasn't for me.
It's for you.

424
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,149
You are misunderstanding him.
- She is right.

425
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,669
I have been looking for a girl
who understands me.

426
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:09,357
But I took time for me
to understand it's you.

427
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:13,549
I'm sorry, Sravani.

428
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:15,909
I hope you understand.

429
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,349
The bride's family
was angry with Priya.

430
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:28,469
They made a mess at the
Marriage Bureau. I went there.

431
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:36,829
Why did you come here?

432
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:39,029
Why did you come again?

433
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:42,549
Do I yell at you
for defaming our Bureau

434
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:45,669
Or beat you up for insulting my daughter
amongst everyone with your proposal.

435
00:35:46,749 --> 00:35:50,429
I might have said it at the wrong place
but what I said was correct, Priya.

436
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:52,829
Dad, don't argue with him.

437
00:35:53,149 --> 00:35:54,033
Ask him to leave.

438
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:55,389
No, Priya.
- What?

439
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:57,109
What?
- Dad, look.

440
00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:00,149
Please leave. Please don't come
infront of me again

441
00:36:13,389 --> 00:36:16,949
At the same time,
I also had a huge blow professionally

442
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,829
Hey... Is everything loading?

443
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,716
We are sending everything.
- Hey bank manager

444
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:29,949
Sir you said it's a lake.
- Hey bank

445
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:31,949
You are standing in the lake.

446
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:33,948
Where is the water then?

447
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:36,029
Mischievous fish drank it all.

448
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,429
Fish? Where are the fish?

449
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:41,028
There goes the murrel,

450
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:42,909
Red snapper,

451
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:44,343
Shark,

452
00:36:45,134 --> 00:36:46,389
Sir, this is unfair.

453
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:50,069
You asked the loan to fill people's thirst
- That is what I am doing.

454
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:52,149
I am filling many people's thirst.

455
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,149
Not with water but with alcohol.

456
00:36:56,769 --> 00:36:59,968
Look... we are sending cases of alcohol.
- I will file a case in court.

457
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:01,888
Hey Bank.

458
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:05,608
those fish are soft only until
they are under water.

459
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:08,848
They become crocodiles
as they reach the shore.

460
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:12,009
They will attack and eat you up.
Leave.

461
00:37:12,328 --> 00:37:13,128
Go.

462
00:37:14,488 --> 00:37:18,288
Without listening to me or checking
the documents, he gave one crore as loan.

463
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:20,772
Wonder how much he took.
- I have already told him, sir.

464
00:37:20,848 --> 00:37:23,208
Loans shouldn't be disseminated like
pamphlets. He didn't listen to me.

465
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,768
He gave loans to everyone
and asks me to recover.

466
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:26,568
Yes sir.

467
00:37:27,408 --> 00:37:31,368
My fellow colleagues, held me
responsible in front of my managers.

468
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:34,008
If I don't repay the money to bank

469
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:37,449
Not only I will lose my job,
they will send me to Jail.

470
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:41,128
This accident happened
when my time was so bad.

471
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:44,368
Tell me what to do?

472
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,488
Hold this.

473
00:37:58,368 --> 00:38:01,288
Don't feel bad.
Problems are common to humans

474
00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:05,889
What? How can you laugh
when your brother is in trouble?

475
00:38:05,968 --> 00:38:08,289
He is not in trouble.
He is in the bank.

476
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:11,169
I have to take his place
to change our notes.

477
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,729
Let's do it. Come on.

478
00:38:13,848 --> 00:38:14,928
What are you suggesting?

479
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,209
Simple.

480
00:38:16,408 --> 00:38:19,209
You would play Lakshmana
while I played Rama in our childhood.

481
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:21,609
I would play Rama
if you became Lakshmana.

482
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,408
We managed well
which ever character we played

483
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:26,928
Make me understand.
- I will come to the bank in your place to

484
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,728
- Rob the bank.
- Shut up.

485
00:38:29,248 --> 00:38:30,129
Rob?

486
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:35,169
He was going to say he would rob
the customers off the recovery amount

487
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:38,448
What will your brother do?
- You seem to be in a hurry.

488
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:39,808
Wait, I will tell you.

489
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:43,375
He will completely focus on the girl
and try stealing her heart

490
00:38:43,452 --> 00:38:44,368
How will I steal?

491
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:47,488
She said, 'Get lost!'
- So she gave a red signal

492
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,248
What do you mean?
- Girls are like traffic signals.

493
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,608
They will give red
if you say propose directly

494
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:56,289
They give orange
if you ask for friendship

495
00:38:56,577 --> 00:38:59,488
And after we slowly impress them,
they give green

496
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:01,968
What if we break the signal?

497
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,369
Oh no...

498
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,892
My brother will just be fined for it.

499
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,049
If it's you, they will
send you to hell, idiot

500
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:10,488
What should I do now?

501
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:12,088
Wait for the opportunity.

502
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:15,408
Every lover has the chance
until the three knots are tied

503
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:17,769
The one who sticks to her for life

504
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,848
The one to steal her
at the right moment is greater

505
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:21,129
I will rush into it then.

506
00:39:21,288 --> 00:39:22,648
I will rob it all then.

507
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:27,208
Go ahead.
- Sir.

508
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:28,408
Go ahead.
- Sir.

509
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,808
Sir.

510
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:35,248
You disturbed me while Alia Bhatt
was about to kiss me

511
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:37,408
Kiss you?
- Obviously.

512
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:39,009
Will she appear in my dreams
to kiss you?

513
00:39:40,488 --> 00:39:41,848
What's this?
- Coffee.

514
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:43,848
don't have the bad habits
like drinking coffee and tea.

515
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:45,448
I begin anything with alcohol.

516
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:47,529
Alright,
What did you make for breakfast?

517
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,329
I prepared Upma.
- Upma?

518
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,648
Am I a prisoner in jail
to have upma?

519
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:53,568
Go and make roti, goat trotters,

520
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:55,689
Chicken curry, and mutton fry.
prepare them.

521
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,048
They have to be hot.

522
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:59,812
Burning hot... Fumes...
Emitting fumes...

523
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:01,692
Is this hot enough?
- Oh, it's burning.

524
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:04,128
Your baldhead wants Alia Bhatt, huh?
- Bro.

525
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:05,928
It's You? Super...

526
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:08,452
You look great as a banker.

527
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:09,208
Kusa.

528
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:12,849
You look exactly like him.

529
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:14,608
When I can't find out,

530
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:17,208
No one in the bank can

531
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:19,768
Hey Kusa, here is the lunch box.

532
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:22,488
When did you wake up
and cook all this?

533
00:40:22,848 --> 00:40:25,168
I didn't sleep all night
out of the joy of meeting you.

534
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:26,928
Careful...

535
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:28,689
Everyone in that bank is a rogue.

536
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:31,648
They are just rogues.
He is above them all

537
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:35,008
Stop it.
- Isn't it true?

538
00:40:35,248 --> 00:40:37,608
You don't worry. I will take care of him.
- Go.

539
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:41,208
Hello, my car.
- Dear.

540
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,209
Dear...
- My wife.

541
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:45,088
Dear.

542
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:49,132
Why did you get our car, sir?
- Would you give me a lift?

543
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:51,489
That is why I stole it.
I am sorry. I brought it

544
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,568
Where can I get you
a TV right now, sweetheart?

545
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:56,769
Even the Bank Manager
is not coming to duty.

546
00:40:58,128 --> 00:40:59,688
What? Mom is suffering with T.B?

547
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:04,128
We can't afford saline as of now.
- What happened?

548
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:06,369
Doctor prescribed once again, sir.
- Oh no...

549
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:08,248
Why didn't you tear the prescription?
- Sir?

550
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:09,609
Tear the prescription.

551
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:12,768
Let it be, sir.
I will let the old lady die

552
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:15,168
But I will not leave.

553
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:17,932
Dear, ask her to come here.

554
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,128
I mean... mom...

555
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:22,569
Ask mom to come here, Ammaji...

556
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:24,969
She ran away
with the fear of medicines, sir

557
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:29,208
My mom died when I was a kid, sir.
My final word

558
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:30,088
Ok.

559
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:33,768
Give me everything you stole
from a good guy that's like me

560
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,368
Like you? Wasn't it you?

561
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:36,249
Did I say like that

562
00:41:36,408 --> 00:41:38,928
I was talking about
the good guy in me.

563
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:39,888
Get me everything.

564
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:42,328
Give me 24 hours
and I will return your money

565
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:43,569
Very good.

566
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:45,328
I will keep this change until then

567
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:48,568
Does 2000 rupees come under change?
- Why do you care?

568
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:51,928
Hey, my fellow bank employees...

569
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:56,289
Audience have a positive reaction
that I am a great actor.

570
00:41:56,448 --> 00:42:00,328
But you blamed me infront of the
auditors with your stupid performances

571
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:01,812
What is this change in you, sir?

572
00:42:01,888 --> 00:42:04,288
Hey... found out.

573
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:08,088
We change addresses for loan sharks
and phones for reception

574
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:12,208
Shouldn't I change my character
for rogues like you? Climb on.

575
00:42:15,088 --> 00:42:16,048
Lav.

576
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:20,328
Look... I don't care
how you go around.

577
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:25,809
You have to do what may
and recover the sanctioned loans.

578
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,208
Or else,

579
00:42:27,448 --> 00:42:30,969
Tomorrow's news will be 'Thieves attack on Bank,
Bank employee's body found...'

580
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:33,808
I understood, sir.
That body is mine

581
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:34,968
Sweet boy.

582
00:42:44,026 --> 00:42:47,649
Virgini.
- Not Virgini, It's V.A Rajini...

583
00:42:48,808 --> 00:42:50,328
Do you have any problem
if I call you that?

584
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:52,848
Not at all.
- What's your problem?

585
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:54,768
When players have no problem.

586
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:57,688
I am just the umpire. No problem.
- Do umpiring and hold this gun.

587
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:00,129
You said you have
lots of doubts in accounts.

588
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:04,569
Let's sit in the locker room
in lunch break and settle it

589
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,849
Locker room?
It's very dark.

590
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:09,808
That is what we want.

591
00:43:09,928 --> 00:43:13,648
Oh! She wants the same
I feel very shy

592
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,131
Hello.
- E verything is fine?

593
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:21,292
All fine.
- Ok.

594
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:23,248
Be ready with cash by afternoon.
Lets change it.

595
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:25,209
Let's leave the city by tonight.
- Ok.

596
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:27,808
NIce.

597
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:29,412
This is really nice.
- Shall I get this wrapped?

598
00:43:29,488 --> 00:43:30,208
That one too.

599
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,929
Choose one.

600
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:35,688
Hi.
- Hi.

601
00:43:35,928 --> 00:43:37,452
Thanks for meeting me
as soon as I called, Priya

602
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:38,289
It's okay.

603
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:40,288
How's the saree?
- It's good.

604
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:41,728
What about this?

605
00:43:42,088 --> 00:43:44,848
Pretty nice color, right?
- You look good in any saree, Priya.

606
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:47,488
What's the occasion?
- My wedding.

607
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:49,689
What?
- Yes.

608
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:51,969
Do you know whose wedding
is the hundredth in our bureau?

609
00:43:52,648 --> 00:43:54,528
It's mine. give me the card.
- Priya.

610
00:43:56,529 --> 00:43:58,488
It's all because of you.
Are you happy now?

611
00:43:58,848 --> 00:43:59,448
Priya...

612
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:02,368
Priya for once...

613
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,569
Do you want me to talk
to your dad? - No.

614
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:05,889
He will get me married tomorrow.

615
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:09,328
Let me be happy this one week.
Please leave

616
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,688
They have been inside for 30 minutes.

617
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:14,208
How long will it take?

618
00:44:14,848 --> 00:44:16,608
What is she showing him?

619
00:44:17,608 --> 00:44:18,928
Lav.

620
00:44:20,113 --> 00:44:23,328
I can't see anything.
- Here, catch me.

621
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:27,969
He is asking her to hold. Hold what?
- Who's the one inside?

622
00:44:37,648 --> 00:44:39,208
Where are you?

623
00:44:41,632 --> 00:44:42,849
Lav.

624
00:44:43,888 --> 00:44:45,825
I will remove it.
- No, Don't remove it.

625
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:49,128
Is this Bank or Bangkok?

626
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,889
It's like a racehorse
has found its bridle

627
00:44:51,382 --> 00:44:52,449
Lav.

628
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:55,089
Where are you?

629
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:58,488
Before these accounts are settled,
population will increase by one.

630
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:01,329
Your death will balance it. Shut up.

631
00:45:04,811 --> 00:45:07,288
Lav, where are you?

632
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:08,928
I am removing it.

633
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:10,368
Lav.

634
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:12,729
Lav.

635
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:15,009
I removed it.

636
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,208
Leave me.
Hold these keys.

637
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:19,848
When did he take keys?

638
00:45:20,128 --> 00:45:22,008
Search everywhere.
Come on. Come on. Make it fast.

639
00:45:22,288 --> 00:45:23,328
Don't spare anyone.

640
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,929
Lav.
- Leave me.

641
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,328
Who is the Branch Manager here?

642
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:31,932
He is settling accounts in the locker.

643
00:45:32,008 --> 00:45:33,729
He settled accounts long back.
He is behind you.

644
00:45:35,169 --> 00:45:35,968
He is the manager.

645
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,488
We are from CBI.

646
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:39,609
Post demonetization

647
00:45:39,888 --> 00:45:42,648
Many managers are scheming
with big shots

648
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:45,849
To replace old notes with new ones.
We got the information

649
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:51,489
Until your entire bank accounts are tallied,
no cash transactions in the bank.

650
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:53,568
Seal the locker room.
- Yes, sir

651
00:45:58,968 --> 00:46:02,088
Hey... Hello
- Stop. Stop.

652
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,812
Why did you bring my vehicle?
- Pay the Ola cab.

653
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:06,852
How much?
- Ola?

654
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:08,208
He doesn't want it seems. Come.
- Ok.

655
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:09,808
Hello. Hello.
- Bro.

656
00:46:10,488 --> 00:46:13,372
If everything went well, we would
be roaming in America in such a car

657
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:15,928
I am already raged. I crush you.

658
00:46:16,248 --> 00:46:17,169
Bro, Bro.

659
00:46:17,368 --> 00:46:19,168
It's been so long since I updated
my Facebook profile picture.

660
00:46:19,248 --> 00:46:20,529
Can you click me a picture?
Please.

661
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:22,608
Ok.

662
00:46:27,257 --> 00:46:28,329
Enough. Stop it.

663
00:46:30,448 --> 00:46:32,208
How do I look?
- You look fine.

664
00:46:32,348 --> 00:46:34,089
Where are you going
all dressed up

665
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:35,649
My girlfriend is getting married.

666
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:39,129
She gave me the first invitation.
I am going for the cocktail party.

667
00:46:39,408 --> 00:46:41,529
It's her wedding
and you seem to be happy?

668
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:44,368
You only said there's chance
until the three knots are tied

669
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:45,129
I'm trying.

670
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:46,968
What did I tell him
and what did he understand.

671
00:46:47,649 --> 00:46:49,888
Why are you so dull anyways?

672
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:52,809
Wouldn't he be dull when CBI came
and sealed the locker?

673
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,449
Why would you be dull for that?

674
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,718
How will we run the bank
with the cash in locker?

675
00:47:03,143 --> 00:47:05,889
You shouldn't worry about
the locker but my job.

676
00:47:07,436 --> 00:47:09,129
I have four more days time.

677
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:13,128
If you don't recover
Yadagiri's lake loan by then,

678
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:16,048
I won't be just fired.
I will go to jail.

679
00:47:17,515 --> 00:47:19,728
You reminded me well.

680
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:24,489
Don't worry. Go party. I will recover
the loan from him.

681
00:47:24,648 --> 00:47:25,528
Thank you.

682
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:28,768
Count would be perfect with bottles,

683
00:47:29,317 --> 00:47:30,568
Why did they put tankers?

684
00:47:30,688 --> 00:47:32,049
How many will they finish now?

685
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:35,011
Sir... we need 4 to 5 for your party

686
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:37,891
4 to 5? My bill will explode then.

687
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:41,169
Get water in buckets,
climb up and fill them

688
00:47:41,248 --> 00:47:43,048
Sir, they are beer tanks.

689
00:47:45,048 --> 00:47:48,369
Aren't you selling cocktails with
a spoon of alcohol and mugs of water?

690
00:47:48,489 --> 00:47:49,809
Mix everything.
- Ok sir.

01:08:33,252 --> 01:08:34,332
Kill him.

[Villagers] Kill him.

1034
01:08:40,132 --> 01:08:43,772
I will burn the Ravan he worships.

1035
01:08:46,452 --> 01:08:50,652
Will he try to stop me?
Will he return alive if he comes?

1036
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:52,292
Give it.

1037
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:57,772
Light it up.

1038
01:09:11,332 --> 01:09:12,812

01:09:44,132 --> 01:09:46,852

1041
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,415
"Ruler of the world,
Emperor of kingdoms"

01:09:58,492 --> 01:10:01,572
"You are a thousand volcanoes united"

01:10:04,252 --> 01:10:07,052
"You are an embodiment of power, You
are the smartest brain in the game"

1044
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:10,172
"You are a thousand suns united"

1045
01:10:12,932 --> 01:10:18,495
Oh, The only warrior... The
courageous fighter... The cruel son...

1046
01:10:18,572 --> 01:10:21,572
"You are the blazing fire,
marching forward swiftly"

1047

"The bloodshed, The burglar,
The brutality, The aghora"

1049
01:11:18,392 --> 01:11:19,372

"Demon, Demon, Demon,

1053
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:54,972
You have to cross the sea
to kill Ravan.

1054
01:12:57,732 --> 01:13:00,495
To kill this Ravan you need...

1055
01:13:00,572 --> 01:13:03,852
Co - Co - Courage

1056
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,412
Do you have it?

1057

Do you have it?

1058
01:13:11,772 --> 01:13:15,492
What do I do to him
who tries to destroy my fort.

1059
01:13:18,092 --> 01:13:20,612
Is it right to kill one?

1060
01:13:24,892 --> 01:13:27,532
Or is right to slaughter
entire village?

1061
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:31,132
Kill him.
- Kill him.

1062
01:13:31,692 --> 01:13:34,532

"The king of the throne.
Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1067
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:35,421
Money is not the issue now,
It's my passport.

1068
01:14:35,502 --> 01:14:37,141
Is there any other way I can reach
America with out passport

1069
01:14:37,261 --> 01:14:40,221
There is an extraordinary option
stay back in India.

1070
01:14:40,902 --> 01:14:42,741
Hello. Hello.
- Sir.

1071
01:14:42,981 --> 01:14:44,862
Sir.
- Damn this guy.

1072
01:14:45,342 --> 01:14:45,705
What?

1073
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:46,705
Phone in the bathroom?

1074
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:47,944
Don't we have phones?
Can't we talk too?

1075
01:14:48,021 --> 01:14:50,421
How will you talk when your phone
is with me? Hold this

1076
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:53,022
Why so long?

1077
01:14:53,341 --> 01:14:55,782
Are you from the Godzilla clan?
Move aside...

1078
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:57,741
Jai, He might be your brother now.

1079
01:14:58,621 --> 01:15:00,181
But we are blood brothers.

1080
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:01,341
Brother?

1081
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:03,781
Did you remember now?

1082
01:15:04,062 --> 01:15:06,181
We just knew he was alive, sir.

1083
01:15:06,421 --> 01:15:07,662
What is this, sir?

1084
01:15:07,782 --> 01:15:11,022
Both of you are the reason
behind Jai turning into Ravan

1085
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:30,861
It wasn't a fire accident,
Like you think.

1086
01:15:31,381 --> 01:15:33,301
It was the rage in Jai's heart.

1087
01:15:33,501 --> 01:15:35,262
It came out as fire.

1088
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:38,181
And burned the good in him.

1089
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:45,102
You didn't recognize Jai as an actor,
brother or even a human.

1090
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:50,301
He went looking for recognition
and fate brought him to Berhampur.

1091
01:16:17,382 --> 01:16:20,181
Jitho, listen to me,
leave me.

1092
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:21,541
Why would I leave you?

1093
01:16:21,741 --> 01:16:24,462
You started your own business
against the Mishra gang.

1094
01:16:24,861 --> 01:16:28,381
Don't you know no one except Mishra
will be recognized in Berhampur?

1095
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:39,061
What was that?

1096
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:41,461
He says no one gets recognition.

1097
01:16:41,622 --> 01:16:44,061
It isn't someones property.

1098
01:16:45,421 --> 01:16:48,381
It belongs to the bravest at heart.

1099
01:16:48,661 --> 01:16:51,621
That day, we weren't
looking at a 10 year old kid.

1100
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:54,381
He is a 10 - headed Ravan.

1101
01:16:54,582 --> 01:16:57,501
It didn't take long for Berhampur
to realize.

1102
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:02,461
Sea mafia, Coal mining.

1103
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:05,622
Settlements.
Not just one...

1104
01:17:06,102 --> 01:17:09,981
He earned recognition
in every illegal activity,

1105
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:13,461
He made lot of enemies.

1106
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:17,941
The two important ones are
Mishra and his brother Tiwari

1107
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:20,982
Unable to face Ravan directly,

1108
01:17:21,181 --> 01:17:25,381
They sought help of that
area's M.P Sarkar.

1109
01:17:25,861 --> 01:17:27,541
So, One day.

1110
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:37,261
Tell Ravan he only has two options.

1111
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:41,181
One... Ask him to touch
our feet and apologize.

1112
01:17:41,382 --> 01:17:43,461
And run away from this area.

1113
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:44,701
Otherwise.

1114
01:17:45,342 --> 01:17:47,502
Live under our feet.

1115
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:52,902
Hey, You gave us two options

1116
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:56,022
But Ravan didn't give you any options.

1117
01:17:56,341 --> 01:17:58,141
Expect for death.

1118
01:18:04,021 --> 01:18:06,741
"Demon... Ravan the demon"

1119
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:15,421
"The one with strange ways to torture,
The one who rings the bells of death"

1120
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:18,621
"The one with a million ways
of destruction"

1121
01:18:21,301 --> 01:18:24,021
"The personnel on the battlefield,
The inhumane monster"

1122
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:27,141
"The finest performer"

1123
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:35,502
"King of darkness, The star,
The cruelest warrior"

1124
01:18:35,622 --> 01:18:38,502
" A demon with beautiful features "

1125
01:18:41,022 --> 01:18:44,265
"In the shape of demon, combative,
Evilest quince"

1126
01:18:44,341 --> 01:18:47,061
"A dangerous demon
laughing like a child"

1127
01:18:50,221 --> 01:18:51,462
Sarkar.

1128
01:18:51,942 --> 01:18:55,422
Do you need his funds
given once in every five years

1129
01:18:55,782 --> 01:19:00,381
Or do you want Ravan
who will be with you forever.

1130
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,690
"Ravana... Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1131
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:08,969
"The commander of enemies
Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1132
01:19:09,089 --> 01:19:11,570
"Ravana... Hail! Hail! Hail!'

1133
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:14,770
"The king of the throne
Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1134
01:19:45,362 --> 01:19:48,162
Sir, I beg you

1135
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:53,002
Please spare my son,
I beg you sir.

1136
01:19:54,842 --> 01:19:56,962
Brother, why don't you stop working
for Ravan

1137
01:19:57,156 --> 01:19:59,282
Don't talk to me about it.

1138
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:00,802
Brother.

1139
01:20:02,442 --> 01:20:05,325
"The finest performer,
The ultimate destroyer"

1140
01:20:05,402 --> 01:20:08,322
"The form of savage
with expertise in destruction"

1141
01:20:11,202 --> 01:20:13,802
"The composer of pathos,
The resident of hell"

1142
01:20:13,962 --> 01:20:17,202
"The one hiding in
the face of brutality"

1143
01:20:22,282 --> 01:20:25,405
"The arrogant one,
The defeated one"

1144
01:20:25,482 --> 01:20:28,562
"The one with a robust personality"

1145
01:20:30,962 --> 01:20:32,685
"The fearless one,
The symbol of denial"

1146
01:20:32,762 --> 01:20:34,082
"The leader with wrong means
and cruelty"

1147
01:20:34,202 --> 01:20:36,842
"The one with his every atom
raging with destruction"

1148
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:39,522
"Ravana... Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1149
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,562
"The commander of enemies
Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1150
01:20:42,802 --> 01:20:45,282
"Ravana... Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1151
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:48,482
"The king of the throne
Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1152
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:52,242
Sir, phone call.

1153
01:20:53,564 --> 01:20:54,441
Hello.

1154
01:21:01,867 --> 01:21:02,802
What happened?

1155
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:06,202
Everything in this
world has an expiry date.

1156
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:10,402
In the same way, Ravan and
Sarkar's relation is on the edge.

1157
01:21:10,634 --> 01:21:13,922
Came in the form of Samasamaj leader
Dhanunjaya.

1158
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:17,602
Understood, right?
If you are fine with it

1159
01:21:18,034 --> 01:21:19,522
Not just an MP seat.

1160
01:21:19,793 --> 01:21:22,882
I will make sure you get
Central Cabinet Ministry

1161
01:21:23,059 --> 01:21:26,219
Even after knowing the equation
between Ravan and Sarkar?

1162
01:21:26,419 --> 01:21:28,339
With what faith do you ask this,

1163
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:33,419
Having our people in the post is different
from having a post for our self.

1164
01:21:36,379 --> 01:21:39,499
Only the winner has recognition.

1165
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:41,899
Not the one behind him.

1166
01:21:45,179 --> 01:21:46,659
Think about it.

1167
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,859
Hey Ravan, How are you?

1168
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,059
Cool. Cool.

1169
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:05,739
Dhanunjay, why did he come here?

1170
01:22:05,899 --> 01:22:08,579
To offer M.P ticket against you.

1171
01:22:13,139 --> 01:22:15,699
The celebrity in a poster
and the guy sticking the posters.

1172
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:18,219
He doesn't know the difference, Dad.
- Hey Deva.

1173
01:22:21,299 --> 01:22:23,579
Dad... we use him
for our daily chores

1174
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:26,379
And they want to send him
to the Parliament. - Deva.

1175
01:22:30,139 --> 01:22:34,819
Every other guy can not
become a politician, Ravan

1176
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:39,859
Why do you take it seriously?

1177
01:22:40,019 --> 01:22:42,219
Just imagine. Just imagine.

1178
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:46,699
Ask Ravan to spell Politics
without a pause...

1179
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:50,139
Deva... Deva...

1180
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:52,339
I'm talking to you. Sit.

1181
01:22:53,099 --> 01:22:54,219
Deva, stop it.

1182
01:22:54,379 --> 01:22:55,779
Say it again.

1183
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,859
Ravan... How dare you cut
my son's tongue?

1184
01:23:08,979 --> 01:23:11,299
I settled for the tongue.

1185
01:23:11,859 --> 01:23:15,659
Otherwise, I would slit his throat.

1186
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:17,342
Take him away.

1187
01:23:17,419 --> 01:23:20,619
Don't forget I am the sitting M.P

1188
01:23:21,819 --> 01:23:24,739
Remember I am going to be an M.P

1189
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:29,899
Ravan decided to grow politically
and went to Delhi.

1190
01:23:38,339 --> 01:23:41,979
Tiwari, raging with his
brother's death, met Sarkar.

1191
01:23:42,206 --> 01:23:43,899
He attacked on the fort.

1192
01:23:44,259 --> 01:23:48,059
As Ravan wasn't there,
he killed his right-hand Tapan.

1193
01:23:59,899 --> 01:24:03,339
We searched the entire city, Maharaj.
We didn't find Tiwari

1194
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:05,579
Uncle.

1195
01:24:07,059 --> 01:24:12,539
Everyone responsible
for this should die.

1196
01:24:22,819 --> 01:24:23,979
Simran.

1197
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:31,619
It's not someone else responsible
for my brother's death.

1198
01:24:32,339 --> 01:24:33,419
It's you.

1199
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:36,179
Your sins have effected my brother.

1200
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:38,539
He died because of being with you

1201
01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:48,339
Brothers and sisters of Berhampur.

1202
01:24:49,299 --> 01:24:51,299
I didn't know he is a demon.

1203
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:54,179
I did a mistake keeping him with me.

1204
01:24:54,499 --> 01:24:56,339
Now I realized that mistake.

1205
01:24:56,899 --> 01:25:00,779
Will you repeat the same mistake
by sending him to the parlament?

1206
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:06,379
If he comes here for votes,
kick him out.

1207
01:25:08,139 --> 01:25:10,859
We are the ruling party
in this constitution.

1208
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:14,699
If he tries to threaten you.

1209
01:25:15,219 --> 01:25:18,899
I will make sure he is in Jail
for life time.

1210
01:25:37,139 --> 01:25:39,339
Brothers and sisters of Berhampur...

1211
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:43,499
It is your luck that Ravan Maharaj

1212
01:25:44,099 --> 01:25:48,459
Will be going to Delhi as
an M.P from this constituency.

1213
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:51,459
We will give each woman 1000 rupees

1214
01:25:52,259 --> 01:25:55,539
And men get to drink all they want

1215
01:25:57,481 --> 01:25:58,859
Don't beg.

1216
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:01,859
They have to vote.

1217
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:05,099
I will kill them otherwise.

1218
01:26:05,979 --> 01:26:08,379
Why should we vote for you?
Why?

1219
01:26:08,899 --> 01:26:10,859
For destroying our lives?

1220
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:13,139
For turning this village
into a graveyard?

1221
01:26:14,859 --> 01:26:16,859
Look there...

1222
01:26:18,619 --> 01:26:20,339
My only son.

1223
01:26:20,939 --> 01:26:23,859
He loved being a cop
and you got him fired.

1224
01:26:24,499 --> 01:26:26,219
You ruined his life.

1225
01:26:26,339 --> 01:26:28,979
You will suffer.

1226
01:26:29,177 --> 01:26:30,819
You will suffer and lose everything.

1227
01:26:33,299 --> 01:26:35,859
What will you do?
- I'll kill you.

1228
01:26:36,059 --> 01:26:38,339
I'll kill you.
- Ravan, leave her.

1229
01:26:40,219 --> 01:26:41,139
Ravan.

1230
01:26:45,379 --> 01:26:47,539
Do you even understand
what you are doing?

1231
01:26:47,979 --> 01:26:50,339
You wont get votes
by threats and dominance.

1232
01:26:51,059 --> 01:26:53,299
You have to impress and plead them.

1233
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:55,539
If required...

1234
01:26:56,899 --> 01:26:59,059
You might even have
to hold their feet.

1235
01:27:02,459 --> 01:27:05,619
I can't do that, uncle.
- Ravan,

1236
01:27:06,299 --> 01:27:11,099
Even a lion puts the head down
to fill its thirst.

1237
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:16,979
You have to put your head down
to fill your thirst for recognition

1238
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,899
The situation is completely different.

1239
01:27:20,179 --> 01:27:23,859
They are the ruling party
and we can not rig the election.

1240
01:27:25,179 --> 01:27:27,859
Ravan can't accept failure.

1241
01:27:28,099 --> 01:27:30,139
He began to think.

1242
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:32,339
At the same time,

1243
01:27:32,499 --> 01:27:36,739
Ravan found the ad given in
the marriage bureau for your wedding.

1244
01:27:38,179 --> 01:27:41,619
We came looking for one
and found both of you.

1245
01:27:45,838 --> 01:27:50,419
He got to know both your weaknesses
and brought your money and Priya

1246
01:27:58,146 --> 01:27:59,499
Get down.

1247
01:28:15,379 --> 01:28:18,699
"Demon, Demon, Demon,
Ravan the demon"

1248
01:28:19,171 --> 01:28:22,579
"Demon, Demon, Demon,
Ravan the demon"

1249
01:28:23,056 --> 01:28:26,459
"Demon, Demon, Demon,
Ravan the demon"

1250
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:30,259
"Demon, Demon, Demon,
Ravan the demon"

1251
01:28:30,779 --> 01:28:34,099
"Demon, Demon, Demon,
Ravan the demon"

1252
01:28:34,579 --> 01:28:37,899
"Demon, Demon, Demon,
Ravan the demon"

1253
01:28:38,344 --> 01:28:41,739
"Demon, Demon, Demon,
Ravan the demon"

1254
01:28:44,059 --> 01:28:47,219
Leader of the Gods!
Ruler of demons...

1255
01:28:52,299 --> 01:28:54,579
Leader of the Gods!

1256
01:28:57,259 --> 01:29:01,779
Ruler of demons,
Lord of Lanka.

1257
01:29:02,299 --> 01:29:04,619
This Ravanasura.

1258
01:29:06,419 --> 01:29:11,659
The name, which makes
the three worlds tremble...

1259
01:29:12,299 --> 01:29:18,459
The name, which can put the guardians
of the eight directions into difficulty...

1260
01:29:20,139 --> 01:29:26,219
The name, which brings shiver
in the spines of Gods and humans...

1261
01:29:27,179 --> 01:29:30,219
I am the fiercest

1262
01:29:30,819 --> 01:29:39,739
And my cheap and inferior
brothers are insulting

1263
01:29:40,859 --> 01:29:45,699
I will right away break his head
into pieces with my weapon.

1264
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:52,979
How is my performance?

1265
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:55,299
Is this acting?
It seemed pretty real

1266
01:29:55,459 --> 01:29:57,419
How are you, brother?
- How is he?

1267
01:29:57,979 --> 01:29:59,539
If properly raised
they will be like you.

1268
01:29:59,859 --> 01:30:01,379
I am like this because
I grew up on the roads

1269
01:30:01,515 --> 01:30:03,419
Jai is like that
because he grew up with fury.

1270
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:05,299
One selfie Jai.
- Hey.

1271
01:30:07,285 --> 01:30:08,419
Uncle.

1272
01:30:10,059 --> 01:30:11,299
My money.

1273
01:30:14,579 --> 01:30:15,459
Priya.

1274
01:30:16,539 --> 01:30:17,699
Triplets?

1275
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:21,099
What is this, brother?

1276
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:23,739
Punish us if you are angry.

1277
01:30:23,979 --> 01:30:25,739
But why did you get Priya
into this?

1278
01:30:25,939 --> 01:30:27,619
Why did you bring us here?

1279
01:30:27,979 --> 01:30:30,339
You are good actors, right?

1280
01:30:30,819 --> 01:30:35,099
I wanted you to play some characters

1281
01:30:35,979 --> 01:30:38,059
Oh, That's the matter.

1282
01:30:38,136 --> 01:30:41,819
But we have lots of entertainment now
with multiplexes, flash mobs, Netflix etc.

1283
01:30:42,099 --> 01:30:43,459
Who will watch dramas?

1284
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:49,059
You wouldn't be playing
Rama and Lakshmana in the theatre.

1285
01:30:49,579 --> 01:30:52,339
You will play our Ravan in Berhampur.

1286
01:30:52,604 --> 01:30:55,299
What do you mean?
- I told you Ravan is in the nominations.

1287
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,459
You are well educated.

1288
01:30:57,699 --> 01:31:00,499
You should go to Ravan's
election campaign.

1289
01:31:00,859 --> 01:31:03,619
You have to impress people
with your words

1290
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,699
And make Ravan win.

1291
01:31:07,339 --> 01:31:09,379
People are literally cursing him
and you want them to praise?

1292
01:31:10,379 --> 01:31:11,739
How will this happen?

1293
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:14,419
It should happen.

1294
01:31:15,139 --> 01:31:18,339
For you to conquer your love...

1295
01:31:18,899 --> 01:31:21,819
It should happen for sure.

1296
01:31:25,459 --> 01:31:26,699
What are you thinking about?

1297
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,099
You gave loans to strangers
and roamed behind them.

1298
01:31:29,579 --> 01:31:31,499
Can't you do this for your brother?

1299
01:31:31,659 --> 01:31:33,339
He will do it, Jai.
I will accept it.

1300
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:36,459
I will stay home, serve you

1301
01:31:36,539 --> 01:31:38,659
I will take care of the house

1302
01:31:39,419 --> 01:31:40,899
Actor.

1303
01:31:42,179 --> 01:31:42,939
Thanks, Jai.

1304
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:45,899
Hello actor, you have a role too.

1305
01:31:47,059 --> 01:31:49,739
I make a living out of fooling people.
What do I know, sir?

1306
01:31:49,979 --> 01:31:54,459
Use the same smartness and get
Tapan's sister Simran to love Ravan

1307
01:31:55,299 --> 01:31:57,139
Tapan's sister?

1308
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:02,099
Oh no! That revenge queen!
- Yes.

1309
01:32:02,339 --> 01:32:04,619
You should approach Simran as Ravan.

1310
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:08,059
Make her feel love
instead of raging fury.

1311
01:32:08,259 --> 01:32:10,582
You should convince her
to marry Ravan

1312
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:12,699
So, I will make the goal
and Jai gets the trophy.

1313
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:15,779
How can we both roam around
in the same city with similar face?

1314
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:17,819
She stays in a different city.

1315
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:21,699
Do I have to travel everyday?
This isn't correct,

1316
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:22,979
We will not do it.

1317
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:28,259
No. Don't hurt Priya.

1318
01:32:28,819 --> 01:32:30,299
I will do as you say.

1319
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,819
Oh! I am also ready.

1320
01:32:43,339 --> 01:32:46,979
Lava... I have seen this body
somewhere

1321
01:32:47,423 --> 01:32:49,099
Mosquito is dead.

1322
01:32:49,299 --> 01:32:51,899
Hey, uncle.
- My dear...

1323
01:32:52,339 --> 01:32:53,259
Hey, stop it.

1324
01:32:53,579 --> 01:32:57,019
You left long ago.
You had to come here again...

1325
01:32:57,299 --> 01:33:00,659
I didn't land here,
he got me here.

1326
01:33:00,859 --> 01:33:01,539
When?

1327
01:33:01,739 --> 01:33:04,619
Someone gave me an idea
for earning money.

1328
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,299
So I uploaded a Dubsmash
of this Ravan on YouTube.

1329
01:33:10,499 --> 01:33:13,739
That's it. The one who
shouldn't see it has seen it

1330
01:33:13,819 --> 01:33:15,139
And brought me here.

1331
01:33:15,216 --> 01:33:17,819
Guys bend.
- Mosquito is dead.

1332
01:33:18,442 --> 01:33:21,459
He is avenging just because
you made him do it.

1333
01:33:21,539 --> 01:33:24,542
Yes. - It's hard to do
the same job all day.

1334
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:28,059
No, I also have tea breaks in between.

1335
01:33:28,139 --> 01:33:29,619
At least they are giving you Tea.

1336
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:32,022
They won't give me,
I should give them.

1337
01:33:32,099 --> 01:33:34,419
Disguise them like Ravan.
- Ok brother.

1338
01:33:47,867 --> 01:33:51,587
From today in the eyes of the world

1339
01:33:51,707 --> 01:33:58,146
The way you dress, talk
and walk has to reflect me

1340
01:34:01,026 --> 01:34:03,426
Except my men,

1341
01:34:03,858 --> 01:34:06,827
No one should know
that there are three of us

1342
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:12,026
Ravan only knows how to hold
his head high.

1343
01:34:12,746 --> 01:34:17,226
Doesn't know to hang it down.

1344
01:34:18,827 --> 01:34:21,546
Understood?
- Yes, I understood.

1345
01:34:21,623 --> 01:34:23,747
We will perform like
you are staring at your reflection.

1346
01:34:24,051 --> 01:34:24,546
Ok?

1347
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:26,906
Don't perform infront of me.

1348
01:34:28,346 --> 01:34:30,186
Do it infront of people.

1349
01:34:38,306 --> 01:34:41,826
Hey, stop.
stop the vehicle.

1350
01:34:42,587 --> 01:34:45,546
When the entire town
is waiting for your death,

1351
01:34:45,789 --> 01:34:48,546
How can you ask for votes?

1352
01:34:48,996 --> 01:34:52,026
A demon can never be a leader.
- Move.

1353
01:34:52,684 --> 01:34:54,066
Sarkar has already told us...

1354
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:57,146
You can't do anything.
- What are you talking? Move.

1355
01:35:04,307 --> 01:35:07,090
Save me.

1356
01:35:13,148 --> 01:35:14,226
Where do I go?

1357
01:35:15,074 --> 01:35:16,427
Oh no.
She is here.

1358
01:35:16,746 --> 01:35:18,467
How are you propose me?

1359
01:35:18,543 --> 01:35:21,146
I'm in a terrible situation
please understand.

1360
01:35:24,012 --> 01:35:24,856
Stop.

1361
01:35:26,749 --> 01:35:28,667
Nun, she is firing with a gun.

1362
01:35:28,746 --> 01:35:31,067
Praise the lord.
- I don't need any praise now.

1363
01:35:31,146 --> 01:35:32,775
Amen.
- Not her but me.

1364
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:33,949
Yes, we are nun's

1365
01:35:34,026 --> 01:35:36,266
Unnecessarily I told you.
You won't understand.

1366
01:35:36,612 --> 01:35:38,786
Save me.
Oh no.

1367
01:35:42,666 --> 01:35:44,430
Start the vehicle.
She is behind me.

1368
01:35:44,507 --> 01:35:46,667
Wait guys.
- Stop.

1369
01:35:47,466 --> 01:35:48,829
I'll kill you.
- Stop.

1370
01:35:48,906 --> 01:35:49,946
Come on.

1371
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:59,546
In such a big fort,
where will they hide my money.

1372
01:35:59,831 --> 01:36:01,026
Let's search.

1373
01:36:18,643 --> 01:36:20,466
That's me...

1374
01:36:25,626 --> 01:36:30,026
Despite having all this gold here,
you got greedy for five crores.

1375
01:36:30,107 --> 01:36:31,226
Idiot.

1376
01:36:31,746 --> 01:36:32,507
Pack it.

1377
01:36:36,467 --> 01:36:38,866
He is here.
'You are in a state of indecisiveness'

1378
01:36:38,942 --> 01:36:39,827
Stop it.

1379
01:36:40,318 --> 01:36:41,226
I'm Lava.

1380
01:36:41,892 --> 01:36:43,187
Oh, it's you.

1381
01:36:43,633 --> 01:36:45,066
I thought it was Jai and yelled.

1382
01:36:45,526 --> 01:36:48,107
What are you doing there?
- I am packing everything.

1383
01:36:48,186 --> 01:36:50,627
People say life is all about setting.
That is why I am setting everything.

1384
01:36:50,747 --> 01:36:51,746
I didn't get you.

1385
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:53,267
A bullet

1386
01:36:53,346 --> 01:36:55,986
I understood the value of life
after a bullet missed me by an inch.

1387
01:36:56,147 --> 01:36:57,786
She is mental. Just like him.

1388
01:36:58,063 --> 01:37:01,506
That is why you and I running away tonight
with my gold and your sweetheart

1389
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:03,746
It's wrong.
- What's wrong?

1390
01:37:04,186 --> 01:37:04,986
What's wrong?

1391
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:07,907
It's wrong of him to play around with our lives,
not considering we are his brothers

1392
01:37:08,241 --> 01:37:09,186
No.

1393
01:37:09,746 --> 01:37:13,067
Today, I could literally see
the hatred for him in people's eyes

1394
01:37:13,146 --> 01:37:14,426
Wouldn't they hate him?

1395
01:37:14,727 --> 01:37:16,547
He has turned into a demon.

1396
01:37:16,907 --> 01:37:20,226
We are responsible for it.
- What did we do?

1397
01:37:21,467 --> 01:37:25,307
While we were kids he loved us.
Do you remember?

1398
01:37:28,746 --> 01:37:30,347
Hey Kusa hold my hand.

1399
01:37:30,868 --> 01:37:35,867
"A beautiful world... Within is a sky"

1400
01:37:36,028 --> 01:37:40,226
"The three birds are flying"

1401
01:37:41,151 --> 01:37:45,791
"To see no tears rolling down
their eyes"

1402
01:37:45,951 --> 01:37:50,391
"The big one casts his smile"

1403
01:37:51,391 --> 01:37:59,311
"He has a heart of Caress"

1404
01:38:01,511 --> 01:38:09,431
"A hand of service"

1405
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:16,311
"He is an example of brother"

1406
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:21,871
"Back then we did forget him"

1407
01:38:27,111 --> 01:38:31,991
"A beautiful world... Within is a sky"

1408
01:38:32,271 --> 01:38:36,271
"The three birds are flying"

1409
01:38:37,391 --> 01:38:41,991
"To see no tears rolling down
their eyes"

1410
01:38:42,231 --> 01:38:44,671
"The big one casts his smile"

1411
01:38:44,911 --> 01:38:48,591
Only when you are always together
like this, you will be Jai Lava Kusa

1412
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:58,231
At a tender age,
we killed the love in him

1413
01:38:58,911 --> 01:39:01,791
And became the reason
behind his cruelty.

1414
01:39:02,751 --> 01:39:03,671
That is why...

1415
01:39:04,511 --> 01:39:10,431
It's our responsibility to kill the
demon and make him a normal person.

1416
01:39:10,671 --> 01:39:12,031
What are you talking?

1417
01:39:12,151 --> 01:39:14,631
Is he gold to exchange easily?

1418
01:39:14,711 --> 01:39:17,711
You stay here. I am running away
with my gold

1419
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:19,431
I will not let you go.
- I'll beat you.

1420
01:39:19,631 --> 01:39:21,751
Move aside. I have to leave
- Where are you going?

1421
01:39:22,151 --> 01:39:24,671
Oh no, the demon is here.

1422
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:36,031
What's happening here?

1423
01:39:36,111 --> 01:39:40,671
It's been so long since we performed.
We were just rehearsing. Isn't it?

1424
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:42,431
That's it...

1425
01:39:46,831 --> 01:39:49,471
You tell me.
- He wants to run away.

1426
01:39:49,676 --> 01:39:52,231
You didn't utter a single error.

1427
01:39:52,351 --> 01:39:53,911
Damn! to your honesty.

1428
01:39:54,151 --> 01:39:57,591
This reminds me... I have to impress
that girl early in the morning.

1429
01:39:57,711 --> 01:39:59,834
My face has to be fresh,
I will go sleep.

1430
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:02,031
You guys switch off the lights and sleep.
- Stop.

1431
01:40:03,231 --> 01:40:04,071
For what?

1432
01:40:04,431 --> 01:40:08,555
Oh no! I will not run away again.

1433
01:40:08,631 --> 01:40:12,231
I swear.
Uncle, please save me.

1434
01:40:12,471 --> 01:40:15,431
Once he lifts,
he won't put it down.

1435
01:40:15,591 --> 01:40:17,351
Everything is like a massage.

1436
01:40:21,271 --> 01:40:22,311
Can you change Jai?

1437
01:40:22,511 --> 01:40:24,871
My mother had only one wish Priya.

1438
01:40:26,111 --> 01:40:28,271
That we three should be together.

1439
01:40:28,511 --> 01:40:29,591
But bad luck.

1440
01:40:30,391 --> 01:40:31,511
We are like this.

1441
01:40:32,591 --> 01:40:34,751
I'll make her wish true, Priya.

1442
01:40:35,951 --> 01:40:37,711
I am going back from here
only with my brother.

1443
01:40:38,271 --> 01:40:40,151
I'm prepared to do anything for it.

1444
01:40:41,111 --> 01:40:41,991
I'm with you.

1445
01:40:43,071 --> 01:40:44,471
Hey.
- Son.

1446
01:40:44,871 --> 01:40:48,594
What's that song
and what's this smoke?

1447
01:40:48,671 --> 01:40:51,191
Song is of Keeravani
and smoke is from incense sticks

1448
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:53,311
Yes. I lit them up.

1449
01:40:54,071 --> 01:40:55,631
Please take the offering.

1450
01:40:56,631 --> 01:40:57,471
Brother-in-law?

1451
01:40:58,311 --> 01:41:00,111
At least you take, uncle.

1452
01:41:00,991 --> 01:41:04,551
Why did you let her out?

1453
01:41:04,951 --> 01:41:08,551
She is a lady mosquito.
No way she can escape from this fort.

1454
01:41:08,631 --> 01:41:10,351
That is why I set her free.

1455
01:41:10,428 --> 01:41:12,311
If she is gone, you will be dead.

1456
01:41:16,471 --> 01:41:18,031
Come brother.

1457
01:41:24,271 --> 01:41:26,351
I cooked your favourite food.

1458
01:41:27,871 --> 01:41:29,271
Do you know something, Priya?

1459
01:41:29,791 --> 01:41:31,431
When we were kids,
whatever mom cooked

1460
01:41:31,591 --> 01:41:33,911
Jai wouldn't eat
without feeding us both first.

1461
01:41:34,071 --> 01:41:34,911
What say, Kusa?

1462
01:41:35,031 --> 01:41:36,391
Yeah. That's right.
Carry on.

1463
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:40,591
Though he was the first born,
we came first for him in everything

1464
01:41:42,511 --> 01:41:43,431
Is it?

1465
01:41:43,671 --> 01:41:46,231
Did your brother love you guys
so much?

1466
01:41:46,511 --> 01:41:48,671
Not just love.
We were his life.

1467
01:41:52,951 --> 01:41:54,791
Do you remember all this, brother?

1468
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:57,631
Three of us should always
stay together.

1469
01:42:06,911 --> 01:42:09,894
'Three of us' is a lie.

1470
01:42:10,551 --> 01:42:14,179
'Only me' is the truth.

1471
01:42:16,871 --> 01:42:22,911
If you do such cheap acts again,
trying to get closer to me.

1472
01:42:23,031 --> 01:42:25,071
I will kill you.

1473
01:42:25,273 --> 01:42:26,031
Ok.

1474
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:33,351
Lava, don't feel bad.

1475
01:42:33,991 --> 01:42:36,431
Reach your brother's target first.

1476
01:42:36,911 --> 01:42:38,951
He will automatically
get close to you.

1477
01:42:41,711 --> 01:42:44,591
Sir, even half the crop couldn't
be harvested due to the floods.

1478
01:42:44,671 --> 01:42:48,391
What do we do if you take
away the rest? Sir, that's our food

1479
01:42:48,711 --> 01:42:51,031
What's happening here?

1480
01:42:52,522 --> 01:42:55,631
Maharaj, we lent money on the field.

1481
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:58,951
They didn't even pay the interest.
That is why we are grabbing their harvest

1482
01:42:59,071 --> 01:43:01,951
If they don't pay the actual
we will grab their lands too.

1483
01:43:02,431 --> 01:43:04,791
Leave the harvest here and go.

1484
01:43:08,231 --> 01:43:12,151
The landlord and Ravan are
quite close. You don't involve in this

1485
01:43:13,071 --> 01:43:14,471
Should brother win or not?

1486
01:43:17,871 --> 01:43:22,511
All the bank managers in this town
should be here immediately.

1487
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:29,471
In the banking sector,

1488
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:33,831
First priority should
be given to Agriculture.

1489
01:43:35,271 --> 01:43:38,671
But you, along with
the private financiers,

1490
01:43:39,431 --> 01:43:41,831
Betrayed the farmers.

1491
01:43:44,991 --> 01:43:48,751
Don't grab things from farmers.

1492
01:43:50,075 --> 01:43:53,991
A farmer irrigates
a land for our welfare.

1493
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:58,511
We should wet that land with water
but not with farmers' tears

1494
01:44:00,311 --> 01:44:02,991
You sanction loans to a businessman.

1495
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:07,631
If he is at loss,
he flees the country.

1496
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:10,191
But farmers are not like that.

1497
01:44:11,471 --> 01:44:13,511
If he is at loss,

1498
01:44:14,311 --> 01:44:17,071
He kills himself on that very land

1499
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:19,551
But doesn't even cross
the village border.

1500
01:44:21,231 --> 01:44:24,871
We all choose some profession to live.

1501
01:44:25,547 --> 01:44:29,591
But a farmer chooses the occupation
that keeps us alive.

1502
01:44:33,511 --> 01:44:34,991
Within 48 hours,

1503
01:44:35,231 --> 01:44:39,391
I want loans sanctioned to each
and every farmer in the region.

1504
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:40,671
Yes sir.

1505
01:44:45,271 --> 01:44:48,671
Alcohol is injurious to health,
brother.

1506
01:45:10,631 --> 01:45:12,271
Pizza, ma'am.
- I didn't order.

1507
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:15,271
Your friend might have ordered.
Have it, ma'am. Cheese pizza...

1508
01:45:16,031 --> 01:45:16,991
What's this?

1509
01:45:17,151 --> 01:45:19,231
Oh, what's this?
Let's check.

1510
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:26,311
Hey, who was at the door?

1511
01:45:35,671 --> 01:45:38,031
Wait... Listen to me once.

1512
01:45:38,311 --> 01:45:41,271
I am not Jai.
I am his look-alike younger brother.

1513
01:45:41,431 --> 01:45:43,191
We are three of us.
Print.

1514
01:45:43,471 --> 01:45:45,351
We look exactly alike.

1515
01:45:47,071 --> 01:45:48,794
You won't listen.
You will not.

1516
01:45:48,871 --> 01:45:50,871
You want proof.

1517
01:45:50,951 --> 01:45:53,431
I will use technology.
one minute.

1518
01:45:53,871 --> 01:45:54,511
Wait.

1519
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:03,671
Hey.
- What are you doing?

1520
01:46:03,831 --> 01:46:06,471
I just got off duty.
Preparing fish curry for Jai...

1521
01:46:06,631 --> 01:46:07,511
What about you?

1522
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:09,431
I just got on duty. Here...

1523
01:46:09,791 --> 01:46:10,671
Greetings.

1524
01:46:12,431 --> 01:46:14,271
Why did you put cloth
in your mouth?

1525
01:46:14,351 --> 01:46:16,871
Idiot... I tied her up.

1526
01:46:17,071 --> 01:46:18,231
She doesn't believe
that we are three of us.

1527
01:46:18,391 --> 01:46:19,631
Show that rascal once.

1528
01:46:19,911 --> 01:46:22,231
Don't call him that.

1529
01:46:22,512 --> 01:46:25,111
Is that so?
Please show your brother once.

1530
01:46:25,751 --> 01:46:26,431
Ok.

1531
01:46:28,671 --> 01:46:29,511
Brother.

1532
01:46:31,973 --> 01:46:32,991
What is it?

1533
01:46:35,711 --> 01:46:37,231
I prepared your favorite
fish curry.

1534
01:46:37,431 --> 01:46:39,271
Who told you it's my favorite?

1535
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:41,271
Uncle told me.
- Oh no.

1536
01:46:43,551 --> 01:46:44,431
Understood?

1537
01:46:45,511 --> 01:46:47,071
Listen to me completely.

1538
01:46:49,991 --> 01:46:52,551
What? He wants to marry me?

1539
01:46:52,831 --> 01:46:54,031
That will never happen.

1540
01:46:54,351 --> 01:46:55,551
I will tell you something
that can happen.

1541
01:46:55,831 --> 01:46:58,231
You want revenge
and I want my money.

1542
01:46:58,671 --> 01:47:01,031
You have to do something
for these to happen.

1543
01:47:01,218 --> 01:47:03,831
I will do anything to see him dead.

1544
01:47:04,111 --> 01:47:04,991

1881
02:14:48,979 --> 02:14:52,780
I am pleading you, dear.
Don't kill them.

1882
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:53,779
Brother.

1883
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:56,899
You tell him, brother.

1884
02:14:57,121 --> 02:14:59,220
He really likes you.

1885
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:01,300
He will listen to you.

1886
02:15:01,699 --> 02:15:03,900
Tell him not to kill them.

1887
02:15:04,219 --> 02:15:07,620
Tell him. Tell him.
- I told him.

1888
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:13,699
Yesterday night,
I told him everything.

1889
02:15:15,619 --> 02:15:16,699
Yesterday night?

1890
02:15:18,979 --> 02:15:20,140
What did you say?

1891
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:21,259
Yes.

1892
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:26,100
Kaka told me his entire plan
thinking I was Jai.

1893
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:31,420
They are planning to kill us,
as everyone can't know there are three of us.

1894
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:38,380
Forget love,
we couldn't earn his trust.

1895
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:41,700
If he thinks our death gives him
the recognition he desires,

1896
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,059
Let's die.

1897
02:15:50,392 --> 02:15:51,739
They knew it and still went.

1898
02:16:22,481 --> 02:16:23,980
Same to same.

1899
02:16:26,179 --> 02:16:31,780
I am shocked with the popularity
you gained with speeches.

1900
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:35,299
I was wondering
if it is the same Ravan I know.

1901
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:39,300
But I didn't know
about the other Ravan.

1902
02:16:41,419 --> 02:16:44,899
I was a fool not to guess
there is another Ravan.

1903
02:16:48,139 --> 02:16:49,860
Anyway.

1904
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:56,580
I can kill you both right here

1905
02:16:56,779 --> 02:16:59,460
But I should first know
who Ravan is.

1906
02:16:59,659 --> 02:17:01,780
So, I'm giving you guys an offer.

1907
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:03,859
If you tell me who Ravan is,

1908
02:17:05,220 --> 02:17:06,780
I will spare the other one

1909
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:10,140
I'm Ravan.

1910
02:17:10,339 --> 02:17:11,220
Leave him.

1911
02:17:12,139 --> 02:17:14,620
We thought of dying together.
What is this now?

1912
02:17:15,499 --> 02:17:16,939
We have an oppurtunity here.

1913
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,620
You are a good person,
You should live.

1914
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:22,060
I'm a useless guy.

1915
02:17:22,579 --> 02:17:24,739
There's time before the bomb blasts.
You leave.

1916
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:26,380
I will stop them until then.

1917
02:17:29,220 --> 02:17:31,459
Hey, what are you guys discussing?

1918
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:34,699
I'm Ravan.
Leave him.

1919
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:38,419
No. I am Ravan.
He is lying.

1920
02:17:38,496 --> 02:17:39,300
Shut up!

1921
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:44,460
Lava.

1922
02:17:46,332 --> 02:17:47,140
Lava.

1923
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,820
If he is Lava,
then you are Ravan.

1924
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:58,860
You cut my son's tongue
infront of me.

1925
02:18:00,083 --> 02:18:02,779
Cut Lava's tongue in front of Ravan.

1926
02:18:04,140 --> 02:18:06,259
Hey! Go.

1927
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:19,459
Hey Kusa.

1928
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:43,500
Listen to me.
Leave this place.

1929
02:19:34,219 --> 02:19:39,619
During childhood, I never told you
there was Jai infront of you.

1930
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,820
Even now.

1931
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:53,340
Jai is infront of this Lava and Kusa.
Why don't you tell him Jai is your brother?

1932
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:07,380
Three?

1933
02:20:07,699 --> 02:20:13,780
I would worry if they were
slightly hurt.

1934
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:20,740
And you beat them up badly.

1935
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:26,140
Ravan.

1936
02:20:32,380 --> 02:20:34,099
I'm not Ravan.

1937
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:36,420
Jai.

1938
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:09,019
Kaka.

1939
02:23:10,308 --> 02:23:12,660
Take brothers away from here.

1940
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:21,100
Come on.

1941
02:23:55,740 --> 02:23:57,340
Jai.

1942
02:23:58,500 --> 02:23:59,820
Brother.

1943
02:24:04,459 --> 02:24:05,940
Jai.

1944
02:24:25,328 --> 02:24:26,820
Jai.

1945
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:43,380
Jai.
- Brother.

1946
02:24:44,183 --> 02:24:45,180
Jai.

1947
02:24:46,060 --> 02:24:47,460
- Brother.
- Jai.

1948
02:24:50,314 --> 02:24:51,100
Jai.

1949
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:53,179
Jai.
- Brother.

1950
02:24:53,659 --> 02:24:54,499
Jai.

1951
02:24:55,342 --> 02:24:56,046
Brother.

1952
02:25:14,652 --> 02:25:16,819
Kaka.
- Ravan.

1953
02:25:20,580 --> 02:25:22,540
I promised mom.

1954
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:26,340
Take care of brothers.
- You will be fine Jai.

1955
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:28,260
Jai, you will be fine.

1956
02:25:30,512 --> 02:25:32,860
Life or death.

1957
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:39,460
Love or revenge...

1958
02:25:40,660 --> 02:25:44,393
This recognition is mine.

1959
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:49,699
Brother. Brother.

1960
02:25:49,967 --> 02:25:50,980
Jai.

1961
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:54,019
Jai.

1962
02:25:55,286 --> 02:26:00,100
"Happiness lacking pity"

1963
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:05,140
"Makes you distant"

1964
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:10,380
"More and more distant"

1965
02:26:10,819 --> 02:26:13,500
In this creation the fundamental
for any creature is love.

1966
02:26:14,179 --> 02:26:18,180
Instead of finding loops in others
recongnize their love

1967
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:23,460
If we can't realize that many
people like Jai we change to Ravan

1968
02:26:24,180 --> 02:26:26,020
Though Jai isn't with them anymore.

1969
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:29,220
Forever they are 'Jai Lava Kusa'
