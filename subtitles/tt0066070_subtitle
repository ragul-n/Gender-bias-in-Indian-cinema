1
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:23,052
You might've forgotten me;
but I've never forgotten you

2
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:27,960
On Monday, I'm presenting
the last show of my life

3
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,535
You must come.
Bring David, too

4
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:36,402
Do tell him that even today
I say with pride...

5
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,435
My name is Joker

6
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:50,889
Do you still remember
a little Hindustani?

7
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:54,424
You saw my very first
performance.

8
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,086
Won't you see my last?

9
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,032
I'm sending the ticket

10
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,033
You were mine once

11
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:16,812
I'm presenting the last show
of my life. Can you come to it?

12
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,051
I've called Mr. Kumar, too.
You must come

13
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:39,959
In the history of the circus,
tonight will be memorable.

14
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:45,902
Because after many long years,
once again before you...

15
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:50,065
is your favourite laughing,
singing clown, Raju!

16
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,398
Are you a heart or a man?

17
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,474
A man is all heart. A man has
a heart. A heart has a man

18
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:01,008
You are ailing.
You will be operated upon.

19
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:10,479
- Doctor, what is wrong with me?
- You have a terrible illness.

20
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,420
Your heart is big,
the world is small.

21
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:19,422
Then operate on the world.
Why remove this poor soul's heart?

22
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:26,195
Because no one in the world
has as big a heart as yours.

23
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:52,049
Such a big heart?

24
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:58,561
It's even bigger!

25
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,800
It's grown even bigger.

26
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:54,385
Has someone seen my heart?

27
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:56,054
Here it is.

28
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:04,828
Doctor Saab,
my heart's that big?

29
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:10,129
It's very dangerous to have
a large heart. Look after it well.

30
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:14,432
If it continues to grow,
it will engulf the world!

31
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:20,009
The whole world? Doctor,
my heart will engulf the world?

32
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:33,689
Mr. Mahendra, you must stop him.

33
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:37,292
If he jumps about like that,
he'll die.

34
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:41,691
Will you risk a man's life
for a show?

35
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:47,706
Sher Singh, Raju is not a man.
He is a clown, an entertainer.

36
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:52,034
He'll live here. He'll die here.

37
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:55,774
He'll die here.
He'll live here, too

38
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:00,028
Wonder which subject the new
teacher will teach us today?

39
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:03,635
- It'll be the same algebra and
geometry. - All that is fine...

40
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:07,204
but wonder how she looks?
- She looks like this!

41
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,201
Old and snooty!

42
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,411
She'll say, Go on children...
stand on your heads

43
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:12,870
- Do I look like this?
- No, Madam.

44
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,032
Will you all please sit down?

45
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,038
What is it?

46
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,650
The fatso keeps tripping up.

47
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:47,229
Children, today we have met
one another in laughter.

48
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,471
May you always be happy.

49
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:53,804
It's easy to laugh at others.

50
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:58,339
But you must learn
to laugh at yourself.

51
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,898
The drill, Raju? What is it?

52
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:59,171
Madam... it's very difficult.

53
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,006
No, it isn't.

54
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,841
Watch me!

55
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:11,282
Madam, I've split my pants.

56
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:21,594
Come along.

57
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,511
The seams have opened.

58
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,386
Who made this?

59
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:43,385
My mother.

60
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:47,054
So your mother knows
how to sew?

61
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,297
She stitches my uniform.
She can't pay a tailor. We're poor.

62
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:58,460
Don't say that again!

63
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:02,998
You have such a big heart
and high ideals.

64
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,004
Who could call you poor?

65
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:21,354
- What is your mother's name?
- Only mother.

66
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,501
Your father works?

67
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:34,768
He died.

68
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:46,378
- Before he died what did he do?
- I was very young.

69
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:50,045
I've asked mother often.
But she won't tell me.

70
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:53,389
- She won't?
- No.

71
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:57,118
She won't tell you?

72
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,258
Try this on.

73
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:09,664
- I've made a shirt for you.
- I don't want it.

74
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,533
Why? What is it?

75
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:13,542
What did father do?

76
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,182
Have a wash. Freshen up
and eat something.

77
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,191
No... What did he do?

78
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:36,226
You said father's with God.

79
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,194
Tell me.

80
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,576
Your father!

81
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:06,159
Father was a clown, too?
He made people laugh?

82
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:13,003
Yes, he did. People said he was
the greatest clown in the world.

83
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,403
People went crazy with
laughter each day.

84
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:23,545
The circus was his life.
He always used to sing...

85
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:28,516
Here I shall live,
here I shall die

86
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:34,559
The circus was his life.
The circus caused his death.

87
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:43,527
When he fell from the trapeze,
people thought it to be...

88
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:46,034
...the joker's newest act.

89
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:54,205
He was breathing his last.
And the audience applauded.

90
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:02,780
Mother, I'll be a joker, too.

91
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,656
I'll make them laugh.

92
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:12,423
What did you say?
You'll become a clown, too?

93
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,895
Your father made the others
laugh and left me with tears.

94
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:22,669
Now you? Will you be one, too?

95
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:36,753
I've slogged day and night
to send you to a good school.

96
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,883
Not to have you be
a clown like your father.

97
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,759
So that some day,
while they laugh, you...

98
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:53,364
I want you to study
and become a great man.

99
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:58,036
To be famous and
well-respected.

100
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,579
To live in comfort.

101
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:37,278
You're here?

102
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:46,414
I thought as you were praying
that I'd do the same.

103
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:56,525
Whenever and wherever I've seen
Christ, He always looks so sad.

104
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:59,700
I've never seen Him smiling.
Why is that?

105
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,367
I'll tell you.

106
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,878
He is unhappy because...

107
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:12,848
His children, the people
of the world are sad.

108
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,385
Does my sadness
make Him feel sad?

109
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:20,048
Of course. Because He loves you.

110
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:25,661
I won't be sad.
I'll make Him laugh.

111
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:03,360
We're off to a holiday camp.
Take the musical instruments along.

112
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,233
Now boys, tell me
which instruments you play.

113
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:15,911
Was that you?

114
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:20,845
Come here.

115
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,551
- Play it again.
- But I...

116
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,791
Play that tune again.

117
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:10,174
He won't take a dip...
drag him into it!

118
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,677
No...

119
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,619
Catch him and dip him.

120
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:23,750
Listen, please! I'm cold.

121
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:27,023
I'll catch pneumonia.

122
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:45,106
Help! Help me!

123
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,616
What is going on?

124
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,892
What is it?
Someone's drowning?

125
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:59,723
He isn't drowning.
We want him in.

126
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:03,661
Don't force someone
who can't swim to dive in.

127
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:05,230
But you...

128
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:44,732
Learn some manners. You're
educated. You're not urchins.

129
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:49,045
Come on. Change your clothes.
Come out now.

130
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:12,194
Get dressed!

131
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,799
I've committed a sin,
a terrible sin.

132
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:31,066
They say if you confess,
your sins are washed away.

133
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:37,242
I promise, I swear,
I won't ever do it again.

134
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:51,085
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you home?

135
00:30:56,268 --> 00:31:00,534
I was confessing to Sir.
I have sinned.

136
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:03,299
- Sinned?
- Yes.

137
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:06,867
Children don't sin.

138
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:11,105
I'm not a child

139
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:34,538
Your exams are over. In a few
days, your holidays begin.

140
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,073
I know how much
children love holidays.

141
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,410
If they could, they'd
make Sundays of Monday.

142
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:52,250
Enjoy the holidays, but
don't forget your studies.

143
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,591
Take out your books
and note down the homework.

144
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:23,210
You're not going away, either?

145
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,352
Raju, you're here?

146
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:02,558
Our compartment?

147
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:09,529
- Why are you here?
- I came to see you off.

148
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:14,767
What are you hiding?

149
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:25,215
What is this?

150
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:28,045
A joker, a clown. It's me.

151
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:30,716
Keep it safely.

152
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:43,799
He's very sweet.
He's just like you.

153
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:20,664
This for me, too?

154
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:32,005
How were the holidays?

155
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:35,547
They were too long.
They wouldn't end.

156
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,851
The holidays were too long?

157
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:41,448
The others said the contrary.

158
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:44,855
I don't know. They were no fun.

159
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,291
Why not?

160
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:51,024
You weren't around.
The school was so lonely.

161
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:59,468
David, meet Raju.
He's the smartest in my class.

162
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:03,841
Raju, this is David.

163
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:09,042
My name is Joker.

164
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,053
Raju it's you! Come!

165
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:30,060
Mary, your student is here.

166
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,069
You've come in such
a downpour?

167
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:49,075
I'm delivering the books.

168
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:53,083
From the library.

169
00:42:12,043 --> 00:42:14,034
Madam, I'll go now.

170
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:17,244
You're drenched.
Have some tea.

171
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,540
I'm in a hurry.

172
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:22,208
Mother's waiting.

173
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:46,503
He's a lovable child. He came
all this way in the pouring rain.

174
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:10,223
Is the class over?
- Yes sir.

175
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:26,510
- Are you waiting for someone?
- No.

176
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:34,813
Nothing!

177
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,527
I'm a little late.

178
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,459
You still haven't gone home?

179
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:48,867
Well, I was...

180
00:43:57,915 --> 00:43:59,280
Poor Raju.

181
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:05,011
He's nothing of the sort.
He's very mischievous.

182
00:44:05,189 --> 00:44:07,020
He pesters me no end.

183
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:14,627
He's the pet of the school...

184
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:16,289
...and the staff.

185
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:19,033
He may be the pet of the staff.

186
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:22,505
But for him, only Madam exists.

187
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,037
That's right. He loves you.

188
00:44:29,747 --> 00:44:31,305
He's my student.

189
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:35,542
It's not the love of the student.
It's the love of a 16-year old.

190
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:37,376
16-year old?

191
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:39,852
How can you tell?

192
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:43,720
I've observed him.
He looks at you with love.

193
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,058
But this love is very
painful for him to live with.

194
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:56,065
Turning sixteen is the most
delicate phase in one's life.

195
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,673
It's like the day
rushing to meet the dusk...

196
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:02,802
...which rushes
to meet the night.

197
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:05,612
And the night
rushes to the day.

198
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:13,617
The turn where the day meets
the night is called dawn.

199
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:17,822
It's part night and part day.

200
00:45:18,629 --> 00:45:20,426
Turning 16 is much the same.

201
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:24,493
It's being part-child,
part-adult.

202
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,531
That's Raju's state.

203
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:31,438
He's neither a child
nor is he an adult.

204
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:36,579
He is only... sixteen.

205
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:40,574
On a sixteen year old
blank page, he has your name.

206
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:46,146
- Why?
- It's natural.

207
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:50,721
A climbing plant clings
to whatever supports it.

208
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:56,428
And so a sixteen-year-old
belongs to the one he loves.

209
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,500
You can't.

210
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:07,142
Who can stop a flowing stream?

211
00:46:08,012 --> 00:46:11,675
If it can be stopped, it isn't
a stream, nor is it life.

212
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:14,007
It isn't being 16.

213
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:21,848
- How do you know all this?
- Because I was sixteen once.

214
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:26,559
- And now?
- I'm still only sixteen.

215
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:31,195
- And I love a 20 year-old teacher.
- Lies!

216
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:35,837
- Honestly!
- It's a lie.

217
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,636
How do we decide
if it's true or not?

218
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:43,044
Decide?

219
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:42,236
- How is it?
- Very nice.

220
00:47:45,743 --> 00:47:48,507
I mean the ice-cream
you've not touched.

221
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:52,779
- I thought...
- That I meant Mary?

222
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:57,386
Eat it or it'll melt.

223
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:04,688
I love ice-cream.

224
00:48:05,663 --> 00:48:07,654
- I know.
- Who told you?

225
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:16,506
She also told me you won't be
a barrister or doctor some day.

226
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:20,408
But you'll be a clown,
to make the world laugh.

227
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:26,408
Why don't you laugh at me, too?
Shout like the others: Joker!

228
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:30,810
Don't be angry.
Come with me.

229
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:41,087
A man is born on earth
for a short time.

230
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:44,364
But he is overcome
with sorrow.

231
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:48,861
Only a clown is happy,
no matter what happens.

232
00:48:49,873 --> 00:48:51,704
- Do you know why?
- Why?

233
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:56,171
Because whatever a joker does,
he does it for others.

234
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:59,481
He may cry but
he makes others laugh.

235
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:05,851
He jumps from the heights
so that people may applaud him.

236
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:11,519
He paints his face and
wears strange garbs.

237
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:13,791
He becomes a spectacle.

238
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:18,258
And while the show is on, he
forgets all his own sorrows.

239
00:49:20,004 --> 00:49:22,336
Who is the greatest
joker of all?

240
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:24,669
- Who is?
- I mean till now.

241
00:49:29,813 --> 00:49:30,802
God?

242
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:37,648
He, too, does everything for
others, nothing for Himself.

243
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,761
If I call you a joker,
will you mind?

244
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:50,032
No sir.
From now, my name is Joker.

245
00:49:56,106 --> 00:50:01,840
Ram Ram to Hindus, Salaams to
Muslims, Good Morning to Christians.

246
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:04,444
Sat Sri Akal to Sikhs!

247
00:50:08,052 --> 00:50:11,647
Try my wonderful poison...
no powder!

248
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:15,253
Try it out! Use my black
kohl for your eyes.

249
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:24,799
It's the best for one and all!
Only one rupee a bottle!

250
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:28,402
Good people, try one. Buy one.
Try it! Be generous...

251
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:34,669
What is it? Why stop here?

252
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:37,279
Someone is selling medicine.

253
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:46,318
- That's Raju. My friend.
- Raju?

254
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,253
A class-mate

255
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:58,091
Hello, Bunny. I'm selling.
I may be late for school

256
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,536
Does this boy study
in your school?

257
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:10,443
He's a great fun.
We call him Joker.

258
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:14,575
He's poor, so he has
to make do somehow.

259
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:18,044
We'll have to see to him.

260
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:49,951
- You haven't paid your fees.
- Father, I said I'd pay.

261
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:56,286
My mother is ill. That's why
I'm late. We'll pay up soon.

262
00:51:57,227 --> 00:52:01,425
That's why you go about
dressed as a clown?

263
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:05,828
I like being a clown.
My father was one, too.

264
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,803
You'll have to leave.

265
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,041
You can't stay.

266
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:22,184
Father, Raju is a very
intelligent boy.

267
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,050
It isn't a crime to be a joker?

268
00:52:26,223 --> 00:52:29,556
Many children in the West
study and work, too.

269
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:35,056
I must think of
the other parents.

270
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:48,862
I've been expelled. I wanted
to make You laugh...

271
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:50,869
...may be that's why.

272
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,070
I'm going.

273
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,810
I'm leaving, too.

274
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:08,253
You're leaving?
Because of me?

275
00:54:09,026 --> 00:54:11,290
No, there's another reason.

276
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:15,627
I'm getting married
in a few days.

277
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:20,197
Getting married? To David?

278
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:25,468
Yes, in this church.
You will come, won't you?

279
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:33,372
He wants you as best man.

280
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,854
- Didn't you understand?
- No.

281
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:43,220
The dearest friend
has to be best man.

282
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:47,390
You are our dearest friend,
aren't you?

283
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:51,728
You'll come?

284
00:54:58,075 --> 00:55:00,009
Of course, I will.

285
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:06,015
How can I refuse?

286
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:09,008
I will come, Madam.

287
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:47,305
You're the best man.
It's your right.

288
00:58:32,189 --> 00:58:34,589
- Here.
- What is it?

289
00:58:35,826 --> 00:58:37,293
A present.

290
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:39,786
I should've...

291
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:41,954
I have your gift.

292
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:44,157
My gift?

293
00:58:47,437 --> 00:58:50,838
I have taken your teacher
away from you.

294
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:13,718
But this...

295
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,867
What must I do?

296
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:24,430
Keep it safe.

297
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:28,603
I'm returning it to you.
It's you, for you.

298
00:59:29,045 --> 00:59:31,036
For me?

299
00:59:33,016 --> 00:59:35,007
One day, Raju will become
an adult.

300
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:38,012
Raju, the clown
will stay the same.

301
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:41,013
Innocent and pure.

302
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:44,556
Think carefully before
you give this to anyone.

303
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:52,524
If anyone does anything
for a clown, it's a jest.

304
01:05:49,826 --> 01:05:54,388
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Don't worry!

305
01:05:55,465 --> 01:05:57,456
You speak Hindustani?!

306
01:05:58,268 --> 01:05:59,860
Wait there, you rascal!

307
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:13,006
You tricked me and got
in here? Out!

308
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:21,217
He fooled me!

309
01:06:24,027 --> 01:06:26,018
Take Miss Marina
to the make-up tent.

310
01:06:36,439 --> 01:06:40,535
It's nothing. This man has
made a mistake.

311
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:46,704
Khan, is this a way
to treat guests?

312
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:50,451
I've been tricked.
I was looking for a rascal...

313
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,178
...who came in with him.

314
01:06:52,355 --> 01:06:55,051
Can't you make out between
An Indian and a Russian?

315
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,655
Sir, there isn't much difference.

316
01:06:58,728 --> 01:07:01,993
These people are our guests.
Don't blunder again.

317
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:03,988
I apologise!

318
01:07:05,001 --> 01:07:06,992
Apologise to them.

319
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:09,465
I'm sorry.

320
01:07:13,843 --> 01:07:17,006
Please don't take any offence.

321
01:07:26,789 --> 01:07:28,882
Please forgive me.

322
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:48,022
Your dog is a real torpedo.

323
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:55,035
He shot everywhere.

324
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:58,037
He made me enter places,
I shouldn't.

325
01:09:58,174 --> 01:10:00,870
Be thankful I escaped alive.

326
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:20,058
Mr. Mahendra, I've worked
for you for seven years.

327
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:24,561
I won't tolerate another
ring-master in my place.

328
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:26,562
Why can't you see?

329
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:30,672
The Russian ring-master is
a guest. Give him a chance.

330
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,843
Where is he? None of these
artists look like ring-masters.

331
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:39,313
He's arriving on
the next flight.

332
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,880
I tell you, he'll be
scared to come.

333
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,282
If he doesn't,
then you'll be on.

334
01:10:52,094 --> 01:10:53,925
And if he does?

335
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:21,055
Sir, are you the Russian
ring-master?

336
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:28,891
It's your blue eyes.
I can tell you're Russian.

337
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:31,056
Yes! I'm the ring-master.

338
01:11:31,233 --> 01:11:35,067
You are Hindustani?
Where did you learn it?

339
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:40,736
University, Moscow.

340
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,171
Explain clearly.

341
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:50,914
Professor Koski at the
University said...

342
01:11:51,087 --> 01:11:54,545
Rajovsky, you speak
Hindustani like an Indian

343
01:11:57,093 --> 01:11:59,687
- Here.
- A love-letter?

344
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:03,025
Better than that! It's money.

345
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:12,641
Mr. Mahendra said you will be
performing with the lions.

346
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:20,876
The lions?

347
01:12:24,053 --> 01:12:25,884
Sher Singh, come here!

348
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:30,457
He's the Russian ring-master...
Mister...

349
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:37,055
And this is our ring-master...
Sher Singh

350
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:42,894
He speaks our language
very well.

351
01:12:43,072 --> 01:12:46,405
I do and sometimes I don't.

352
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:51,911
Even if you do, can you understand
the language my lions talk?

353
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:57,075
I'll understand.
Get the lions ready!

354
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:06,355
My foot!

355
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:38,724
Tonight will be a special date
in the history of the circus.

356
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:42,887
Tonight the Ganges
and the Volga meet.

357
01:13:44,066 --> 01:13:47,058
Indian and Russian artists
together...

358
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:50,468
will perform and
entertain you.

359
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:57,603
This is our aim. If the world
wants peace, this must be its aim.

360
01:13:59,081 --> 01:14:04,747
I present Soviet Union's
incomparable trapeze artist...

361
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,217
...Miss Marina!

362
01:15:12,555 --> 01:15:15,023
Excuse me, sir, please listen...

363
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:18,019
He speaks our language!

364
01:15:19,795 --> 01:15:23,231
Don't tell anyone.
I'm not Russian, I'm Indian.

365
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:26,026
- Will you do me a favour?
- Yes?

366
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:32,230
There's 200 in this
and my mother's address.

367
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:36,208
If anything happens to me,
please deliver it.

368
01:15:37,847 --> 01:15:39,508
I'll be grateful.

369
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:47,747
And now we present, Soviet
Union's renowned ring master...

370
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:50,721
...Ivan Rajovsky!

371
01:18:25,114 --> 01:18:28,447
That man isn't from our circus.
He isn't even a Russian.

372
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:32,017
Yes, him! He isn't even
a lion-trainer.

373
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:57,035
Sher Singh, hurry!

374
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:24,856
You speak Hindi.

375
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,158
But you look Russian.

376
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:31,064
You are light-skinned.
Blue eyes and brown hair.

377
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:34,733
You wear western clothes.
Who are you?

378
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:37,339
Isn't it enough for you that...

379
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:45,648
I'm a human-being, who has two eyes,
two ears, a nose, a stomach and...

380
01:20:45,821 --> 01:20:47,345
...a heart?

381
01:20:48,257 --> 01:20:51,749
If you want, call me Raju,
or Rajovsky.

382
01:20:53,095 --> 01:20:56,895
Why did you tell such
an enormous lie?

383
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:01,863
Should I say it in front of all?

384
01:21:02,271 --> 01:21:05,206
Yes, go on and tell us.
They're all friends

385
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:07,041
So listen...

386
01:21:07,876 --> 01:21:11,539
I told a big lie because
we're past the age of small lies.

387
01:21:12,047 --> 01:21:14,038
It's the age of big lies.

388
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:20,048
Women who apply paint and
powder are considered beautiful.

389
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:23,947
People who lie to the public
are called leaders.

390
01:21:24,226 --> 01:21:27,957
In business, the bigger the
lie you tell, the richer you are.

391
01:21:29,331 --> 01:21:33,062
In this field of big lies,
I'm but a small player.

392
01:21:34,369 --> 01:21:38,305
Fool! Don't you realize
you risked your life?

393
01:21:38,774 --> 01:21:41,675
The lions would've devoured you.

394
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:44,742
Yes, I was scared.

395
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:49,814
But in this world,
there's something more scary.

396
01:21:51,086 --> 01:21:53,077
Poverty and hunger.

397
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:58,557
I had to get money somehow
to feed my mother and myself.

398
01:22:00,028 --> 01:22:02,019
For my mother's treatment.

399
01:22:04,032 --> 01:22:06,023
I've wandered from city to city.

400
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:09,093
My mother has been ill.

401
01:22:10,038 --> 01:22:12,506
I didn't have money
to pay the doctor.

402
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:14,832
No one gave me a job.

403
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:18,579
They'd say: You call
entertaining others, work?

404
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,645
Join a circus

405
01:22:22,884 --> 01:22:27,378
The truth is, even the doors of
a circus were closed for me.

406
01:22:28,557 --> 01:22:31,048
To enter I had to tell a big lie.

407
01:22:37,532 --> 01:22:39,056
Tell me...

408
01:22:39,468 --> 01:22:41,459
How do we punish him?

409
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:45,062
What does the jury says?

410
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:13,695
You've been found
guilty of being humane.

411
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:18,863
Our court has decided that
you shall be kept prisoner...

412
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:23,501
in this circus until you wish
to leave of your free will.

413
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:34,177
She says you're a strange man.

414
01:24:35,517 --> 01:24:37,314
Me? Strange?

415
01:24:44,893 --> 01:24:46,554
Thank you!

416
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:55,762
She wants to know why
you're thanking her?

417
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:02,008
Because at least she
considers me a man.

418
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:13,681
She says, when you were
in the lion's cage...

419
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:17,291
...she was very concerned
for your life.

420
01:25:21,897 --> 01:25:23,421
Sorry, I must go.

421
01:25:29,104 --> 01:25:32,437
You were concerned
for my life.

422
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:47,845
You were...

423
01:25:48,056 --> 01:25:50,718
...concerned for...

424
01:25:50,892 --> 01:25:54,384
...for my life?

425
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,191
Da means yes?

426
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:08,870
What do you say for no?

427
01:27:03,999 --> 01:27:06,729
- Listen! - Tell me,
what is the problem?

428
01:27:07,903 --> 01:27:13,239
The problem is that
what does desvidanya mean?

429
01:27:16,077 --> 01:27:18,671
It means, we'll meet again.

430
01:27:48,243 --> 01:27:51,041
What is the matter?
You look very happy.

431
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:54,948
Did you find a job?

432
01:27:56,051 --> 01:27:58,451
What does da' mean?

433
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:05,986
Da' means yes'. From now on,
everything in life is da'!

434
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:09,987
Then bring me a bride.

435
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,999
- A bride?
- Yes. Now say da'

436
01:28:18,073 --> 01:28:20,405
If God wills it, yes!

437
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,969
Come here!

438
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:54,401
Were you just singing?

439
01:32:56,248 --> 01:32:59,411
- Were you singing?
- I won't do it again.

440
01:32:59,584 --> 01:33:01,245
Yes, you will!

441
01:33:03,421 --> 01:33:05,412
And every night, too

442
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:11,426
From now, you'll be a clown who
sings and entertains.

443
01:33:13,698 --> 01:33:17,293
In your circus?

444
01:33:18,603 --> 01:33:20,264
Thank you, sir.

445
01:33:22,274 --> 01:33:24,834
No Sir. Call me Mahendra.

446
01:33:26,111 --> 01:33:28,238
- You called me sir again!
- Sir...

447
01:33:45,797 --> 01:33:47,458
For you...

448
01:34:06,751 --> 01:34:08,878
I'll sing. I'll make them laugh.

449
01:34:33,511 --> 01:34:38,676
I will sing a song
for the audience. A song!

450
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:14,461
Namaste.

451
01:38:24,476 --> 01:38:26,671
How are you?

452
01:38:26,811 --> 01:38:27,800
I'm fine.

453
01:38:27,979 --> 01:38:32,143
No, remember the gender.
How are you, Miss?

454
01:38:32,317 --> 01:38:34,308
I'm fine, Miss.

455
01:38:36,821 --> 01:38:38,982
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

456
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:46,957
You must sit down too.

457
01:38:57,442 --> 01:38:58,841
For you...

458
01:39:23,468 --> 01:39:25,800
It's for you. Try it on.

459
01:39:26,871 --> 01:39:28,463
For you... try it on.

460
01:39:45,623 --> 01:39:48,353
Not like that.
Tie it round your waist.

461
01:40:21,459 --> 01:40:23,450
How do I look?

462
01:40:25,863 --> 01:40:29,060
Remember the gender!
Main kaisi hoon, not kaisa

463
01:40:31,336 --> 01:40:33,133
You look lovely.

464
01:40:42,981 --> 01:40:44,881
Ma will be happy.

465
01:40:49,487 --> 01:40:52,820
My mother.

466
01:40:57,829 --> 01:41:00,229
I haven't a mother, only father.

467
01:41:03,568 --> 01:41:05,559
You don't have a mother?

468
01:41:11,442 --> 01:41:14,275
Well, I don't have a father.

469
01:41:16,514 --> 01:41:22,783
Only mother.
Will you meet her?

470
01:41:28,793 --> 01:41:31,785
My mother will meet
the fairy of her dreams.

471
01:42:23,648 --> 01:42:29,587
- Mother, look who's here.
- Who is it?

472
01:42:29,787 --> 01:42:31,618
The fairy you dreamt of.

473
01:43:46,664 --> 01:43:48,655
May you be blessed with
a long life, child.

474
01:43:55,239 --> 01:43:59,972
May you be showered
with prosperity.

475
01:44:03,014 --> 01:44:07,144
Marina doesn't speak our language.
She isn't an Indian.

476
01:44:07,485 --> 01:44:11,285
- Is she a Bengali?
- No, mother.

477
01:44:12,423 --> 01:44:14,891
She's very fair-skinned.
She must be Kashmiri.

478
01:44:16,227 --> 01:44:18,218
She's belongs to a place
close to there.

479
01:44:18,496 --> 01:44:21,761
Mother, rest.
We must return to the shop.

480
01:44:21,999 --> 01:44:23,660
She works there, too.

481
01:44:24,035 --> 01:44:28,836
Whoever she is, I approve. But
you must stop her from working.

482
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:32,107
Shameless fellow!
Letting your wife-to-be work.

483
01:44:32,443 --> 01:44:35,435
Don't worry, mother.
I thought of that, too

484
01:44:37,515 --> 01:44:39,278
Okay mother, we will go now.

485
01:44:48,926 --> 01:44:52,657
Mother said when a guest...

486
01:44:52,797 --> 01:44:55,789
...visits our home, they
never leave empty-handed

487
01:44:57,401 --> 01:44:58,800
One moment.

488
01:45:11,415 --> 01:45:13,076
Here you are.

489
01:45:14,952 --> 01:45:16,579
What is this?

490
01:45:16,754 --> 01:45:18,415
It's me.

491
01:45:46,317 --> 01:45:48,114
Keep it with you.

492
01:46:38,102 --> 01:46:42,232
- What is this?
- It's me.

493
01:47:00,758 --> 01:47:02,089
Can I come in?

494
01:47:18,476 --> 01:47:19,966
For you.

495
01:50:10,514 --> 01:50:12,175
Sir, you called?

496
01:50:12,616 --> 01:50:16,450
I told you not to call me Sir'
But Mahendra.

497
01:50:17,555 --> 01:50:21,013
You tell the others...
Watch where you're going

498
01:50:22,293 --> 01:50:25,456
You yourself don't watch
where you're going.

499
01:50:26,664 --> 01:50:29,724
- I don't get it.
- Sit down.

500
01:50:34,471 --> 01:50:37,133
Listen, Raju you're a joker.

501
01:50:37,975 --> 01:50:41,138
You make others laugh
at your own expense.

502
01:50:42,046 --> 01:50:45,482
But for your own happiness
you can't make others sad.

503
01:50:48,752 --> 01:50:50,481
Whom do you mean?

504
01:50:51,422 --> 01:50:52,821
Marina.

505
01:50:53,424 --> 01:50:58,418
The Russian artists are guests.
They're leaving soon.

506
01:51:00,297 --> 01:51:01,855
They're good people.

507
01:51:02,032 --> 01:51:06,093
They are our friends. But they
belong to a foreign land.

508
01:51:06,437 --> 01:51:08,428
Their language, culture differ.

509
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:13,171
Maybe you don't know, every
country is separated by a wall.

510
01:51:14,511 --> 01:51:18,174
To come here they need
passports, to go there...

511
01:51:18,315 --> 01:51:19,748
...we need passports.

512
01:51:21,452 --> 01:51:24,979
I know all that.
I was trying to forget.

513
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:32,119
My naive mother dreamt of
a fairy-like daughter-in-law.

514
01:51:33,297 --> 01:51:34,958
She knows no walls.

515
01:51:40,738 --> 01:51:43,798
Trust in me.
I won't forget now.

516
01:51:44,275 --> 01:51:46,072
Your mother is very ill.

517
01:51:46,644 --> 01:51:49,875
She wants to see you
and her daughter-in-law.

518
01:51:51,415 --> 01:51:53,406
Daughter-in-law?

519
01:52:44,468 --> 01:52:46,459
What have you done?

520
01:52:47,938 --> 01:52:50,998
For the first time ever,
you've found a mother

521
01:52:52,076 --> 01:52:55,603
And you will hurt her?
She loves you.

522
01:52:56,413 --> 01:52:58,074
You'll reject her?

523
01:53:11,895 --> 01:53:13,760
What shall I do?

524
01:53:16,266 --> 01:53:17,927
What am I to do?

525
01:53:29,446 --> 01:53:31,971
Come in. Come, daughter.

526
01:53:34,017 --> 01:53:35,450
My daughter.

527
01:53:41,225 --> 01:53:43,955
How are you?

528
01:53:53,737 --> 01:53:58,606
I was telling Raju
only today...

529
01:53:58,809 --> 01:54:00,800
...to bring my fairy.

530
01:54:01,412 --> 01:54:05,405
I'd see her and I'd be fine.

531
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:12,218
Raju is a very good man.

532
01:54:14,558 --> 01:54:16,549
His heart is...

533
01:54:46,457 --> 01:54:48,721
You're crying?

534
01:54:50,527 --> 01:54:53,792
My heart is crying!

535
01:55:04,007 --> 01:55:05,406
My child...

536
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:13,603
Your son is a wonder. He makes
everyone roar with laughter.

537
01:56:15,145 --> 01:56:17,010
So he does, does he?

538
01:56:18,549 --> 01:56:20,414
That's what I feared.

539
01:56:20,584 --> 01:56:22,415
Please sit in the front.

540
01:56:41,705 --> 01:56:45,641
The circus was life for him.
The circus meant death for him

541
01:56:49,713 --> 01:56:54,275
When he fell from the trapeze.
The audience thought...

542
01:56:54,451 --> 01:56:56,612
here's the clown's latest act

543
01:56:58,455 --> 01:57:04,189
He was breathing his last breath
and they applauded

544
02:00:07,444 --> 02:00:10,038
Mother!

545
02:00:17,988 --> 02:00:20,456
Now you know the truth.

546
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:25,860
Don't be annoyed with me;
what else could I do?

547
02:00:26,296 --> 02:00:28,127
Where else could I go?

548
02:00:28,398 --> 02:00:29,592
My father's blood...

549
02:00:29,733 --> 02:00:34,295
runs in my veins and says:
Here I shall live and die

550
02:00:34,471 --> 02:00:36,666
Where else can I go

551
02:01:39,469 --> 02:01:40,868
Raju's mother.

552
02:01:54,484 --> 02:01:56,042
Raju, you're on.

553
02:02:00,423 --> 02:02:02,414
Raju, you're on next.

554
02:02:10,433 --> 02:02:11,832
The microphone.

555
02:02:21,444 --> 02:02:24,436
Now we present...

556
02:02:24,614 --> 02:02:31,611
the most unusual clown.
The bravest of them all.

557
02:02:33,456 --> 02:02:37,324
Our dearest laughing and
singing, Raju!

558
02:02:44,801 --> 02:02:46,860
This is your test, Raju.

559
02:02:47,671 --> 02:02:52,802
Today you must prove to the world
how big the heart of a clown is!

560
02:03:17,667 --> 02:03:20,431
This was near her
when she died.

561
02:05:26,429 --> 02:05:29,159
Yes, this is the circus.

562
02:05:30,433 --> 02:05:34,563
And the show lasts for
three full hours.

563
02:05:59,295 --> 02:06:00,523
And after that...

564
02:07:41,231 --> 02:07:43,222
You're crying?

565
02:07:48,338 --> 02:07:53,275
We say, we shall meet again.

566
02:07:54,277 --> 02:07:56,108
We'll meet again.

567
02:07:59,549 --> 02:08:03,315
If we never part,
how do we meet again?

568
02:08:06,723 --> 02:08:11,126
- I'm not a philosopher.
- Every clown is a philosopher.

569
02:08:17,734 --> 02:08:20,931
I love you.

570
02:08:38,488 --> 02:08:41,150
To meet and to part...

571
02:08:42,592 --> 02:08:48,827
To part and to meet, that's life!

572
02:08:50,099 --> 02:08:52,033
If that's life,
what's death?

573
02:08:53,036 --> 02:08:55,027
I don't know.

574
02:08:59,442 --> 02:09:01,910
You aren't annoyed, are you?

575
02:09:05,448 --> 02:09:07,348
Are you sad?

576
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:13,111
Take those glasses off.

577
02:09:59,035 --> 02:10:01,026
May I ask you for something?

578
02:10:02,271 --> 02:10:05,866
Whatever I had, I gave you.
My life is all that's left.

579
02:10:32,468 --> 02:10:35,130
I have heard and
seen love talk.

580
02:10:35,605 --> 02:10:38,870
But what did she say in Russian
before she left?

581
02:10:42,478 --> 02:10:46,812
She reminded me of
an old song.

582
02:13:05,988 --> 02:13:08,081
What are you looking at
Mr. Rajendra Kumar?

583
02:13:09,091 --> 02:13:12,151
Some day, my face will be
on an even bigger poster.

584
02:13:27,810 --> 02:13:30,973
You thief!
Running away with my Moti!

585
02:13:32,448 --> 02:13:34,939
Is Moti your dog?
He's really a gem.

586
02:13:35,117 --> 02:13:38,553
A gem or a pearl. He is
mine. If you touch him...

587
02:13:40,189 --> 02:13:43,249
Good grief! Are you a boy
or a film gangster?

588
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:45,860
How you wield a tin knife!

589
02:13:47,330 --> 02:13:50,128
Shall I show you
how sharp it really is?

590
02:13:54,503 --> 02:13:55,993
Well, kid?

591
02:13:56,405 --> 02:14:00,136
Children don't play with knives.
Get it? Here...

592
02:14:00,743 --> 02:14:03,405
You think I was running away
with your dog?

593
02:14:04,413 --> 02:14:07,610
I'm not that stupid, I've
nothing to eat, how do I feed it?

594
02:14:08,417 --> 02:14:10,408
Was I kidnapping you?

595
02:14:13,422 --> 02:14:14,912
Come, Moti.

596
02:14:15,091 --> 02:14:20,586
- What's your name?
- Minoo. What's yours?

597
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:23,421
Raju. Have you a job?

598
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,991
Sometimes I get this work.

599
02:14:26,602 --> 02:14:29,264
Putting up posters?

600
02:14:30,006 --> 02:14:31,997
And otherwise?

601
02:14:33,776 --> 02:14:39,442
- Nothing. - That means
we're both in the same business.

602
02:14:39,782 --> 02:14:44,116
Let's try turning tables.
Raju and Minoo.

603
02:14:46,188 --> 02:14:48,782
And Moti too.
But what can we three do?

604
02:14:51,394 --> 02:14:54,557
Minoo, what can't
the three of us do.

605
02:14:54,864 --> 02:14:56,855
Let's shake hands!

606
02:14:59,402 --> 02:15:02,803
Am I not right, Moti? Now you
watch what we three will do.

607
02:15:26,862 --> 02:15:32,425
You've seen the great footpath
circus performers perform.

608
02:15:32,768 --> 02:15:35,032
Now let us see
kind-hearted souls perform.

609
02:15:35,271 --> 02:15:39,264
Put your hands
in your pocket.

610
02:15:39,542 --> 02:15:44,275
Take out some money. Be a rupee,
or two rupees or a five rupees!

611
02:15:46,615 --> 02:15:48,446
One, two rupees...

612
02:15:49,151 --> 02:15:51,551
Five paise, ten paise,
fifteen...

613
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:55,282
Ten paise, five paise,
three paise...

614
02:15:55,458 --> 02:15:58,723
Your smallest coin will be
like a million for us.

615
02:15:58,894 --> 02:16:02,386
Give freely,
Give generously!

616
02:16:11,273 --> 02:16:12,262
Three Cheers!

617
02:16:12,475 --> 02:16:15,069
Minoo, Moti, Raju... Hurray!

618
02:16:16,746 --> 02:16:20,204
Master, which gutter
are you taking me into?

619
02:16:20,416 --> 02:16:23,146
Hey mister, don't you
dare call this a gutter.

620
02:16:23,519 --> 02:16:25,851
This leads straight to heaven.

621
02:16:34,430 --> 02:16:36,159
Here's heaven.

622
02:16:37,166 --> 02:16:39,031
It's very nice.

623
02:16:39,435 --> 02:16:42,598
You must have paid atleast
a 2000 deposit, how did you do it?

624
02:16:43,239 --> 02:16:47,005
I got it for free. The
poor man who build it died.

625
02:16:47,443 --> 02:16:48,967
He died?

626
02:16:50,446 --> 02:16:53,244
See that bridge.
He came under a train.

627
02:16:53,582 --> 02:16:57,040
Ever since then, people say
his ghost haunts the house.

628
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,788
- His ghost?
- Yes, that's what people think.

629
02:17:01,123 --> 02:17:03,785
That's why no one dares enter.

630
02:17:11,901 --> 02:17:14,233
Aren't you scared of ghosts?

631
02:17:15,204 --> 02:17:21,871
Me? Raju, in this world I see
nothing but ghosts about me.

632
02:17:24,713 --> 02:17:29,150
Why should I fear that poor
man's ghost? Aren't I right?

633
02:17:29,485 --> 02:17:31,953
Yes, I'm not scared of
ghosts either.

634
02:17:32,288 --> 02:17:34,153
What do you mean?

635
02:17:36,292 --> 02:17:39,159
I mean that from today
I'll live here, too!

636
02:17:40,496 --> 02:17:42,054
And the rent?

637
02:17:42,231 --> 02:17:45,826
But... there isn't
any rent to pay.

638
02:17:46,936 --> 02:17:50,099
Well, I'll pay half
of nothing, too.

639
02:17:50,506 --> 02:17:52,565
How is that possible?

640
02:17:53,442 --> 02:17:56,104
The hut is too small
for the three of us.

641
02:17:56,345 --> 02:17:59,746
There's me, Moti and you.
And there is only one bed.

642
02:18:00,249 --> 02:18:04,049
So? I'll sleep on the floor.
Moti can sleep under the bed.

643
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:07,254
Suppose you're cold at nights?

644
02:18:07,489 --> 02:18:09,480
We'll squeeze in with you.

645
02:18:10,593 --> 02:18:15,155
Don't you dare do that!
I'll smash your head in.

646
02:18:16,532 --> 02:18:21,367
OK! You sleep comfortably on
your bed. I'm used to the floor.

647
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:24,867
I think we should
get food organised.

648
02:18:25,674 --> 02:18:29,132
Let's share our earnings.
Out with the money!

649
02:18:29,778 --> 02:18:33,111
Yes, of course. Why not?
Here, sit down.

650
02:18:35,918 --> 02:18:39,115
Altogether that makes
three rupees forty five paise.

651
02:18:40,489 --> 02:18:46,621
So that means you get
one rupees and fifteen paise.

652
02:18:47,696 --> 02:18:52,292
One rupee and fifteen
paise are mine.

653
02:18:52,935 --> 02:18:56,200
And one rupee fifteen
paise for Moti.

654
02:18:56,505 --> 02:19:01,306
- Moti gets a share, too?
- Why not? Isn't Moti human?

655
02:19:17,459 --> 02:19:19,723
So Minoo, how was our circus?

656
02:19:20,062 --> 02:19:23,190
- First-class!
- Partner, let's shake on it.

657
02:19:31,573 --> 02:19:35,634
Minoo Master, your hand
is just like girl's hand.

658
02:19:36,011 --> 02:19:37,638
Don't call me a girl!

659
02:19:39,682 --> 02:19:41,377
I'll cut you!

660
02:19:41,650 --> 02:19:43,641
I'll kill you!

661
02:19:54,163 --> 02:19:56,222
Bravo! Now clap, Children!

662
02:20:02,905 --> 02:20:08,309
Saw how the African lion
jumped through the ring?

663
02:20:09,044 --> 02:20:12,445
Now all of you
watch Minno's marvel!

664
02:20:13,182 --> 02:20:16,117
Master Minoo will risk his life.
Through a ring...

665
02:20:16,251 --> 02:20:20,847
...of knives sharp as
swords he will jump.

666
02:20:21,156 --> 02:20:27,288
Come on Master Minoo,
show your wonders!

667
02:20:29,665 --> 02:20:33,032
Be careful. You nearly
tore your expensive shirt.

668
02:21:21,183 --> 02:21:23,777
I will explain everything.

669
02:21:29,458 --> 02:21:33,155
Minoo master lied!

670
02:21:36,698 --> 02:21:39,030
Raju, don't leave me alone.

671
02:22:46,368 --> 02:22:48,962
You're back.
Where were you all night?

672
02:22:49,905 --> 02:22:53,568
In hell or in heaven...
who are you to ask?

673
02:22:54,409 --> 02:22:56,400
I'm your friend, Minoo master.

674
02:22:59,314 --> 02:23:01,714
You're not master
but Miss Minoo.

675
02:23:02,151 --> 02:23:04,142
You're no friend.
You can't be.

676
02:23:04,419 --> 02:23:08,913
What is it? What sin have I
committed that ends friendship?

677
02:23:10,092 --> 02:23:11,821
That sin is called lying.

678
02:23:14,596 --> 02:23:16,587
I can tolerate a lot.

679
02:23:19,568 --> 02:23:22,162
I've lived through a lot...

680
02:23:22,437 --> 02:23:24,428
...unfaithfulness, selfishness
and injustice.

681
02:23:24,606 --> 02:23:28,599
But I can't tolerate lies. Your
friendship was based on a lie.

682
02:23:30,345 --> 02:23:32,006
It was a lie.

683
02:23:32,447 --> 02:23:34,438
But you were responsible for it.

684
02:23:35,584 --> 02:23:37,279
- Me? - Yes, you!

685
02:23:39,454 --> 02:23:41,445
Not you alone, but all men.

686
02:23:44,326 --> 02:23:46,317
You don't know...

687
02:23:46,628 --> 02:23:50,462
how many trials a parentless
girls has to face.

688
02:23:52,401 --> 02:23:55,393
I arrived in Bombay
with high hopes.

689
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:03,803
I had dreams of becoming an
actress, of working in films.

690
02:24:07,182 --> 02:24:11,846
But it is very tough for a girl
to live respectably in a city.

691
02:24:13,422 --> 02:24:15,413
Very difficult, Raju.

692
02:24:17,326 --> 02:24:19,317
Everyone eyed me with an evil motive.

693
02:24:20,596 --> 02:24:24,930
I decided that in order to
save my honour, I had to die.

694
02:24:26,568 --> 02:24:30,231
The long-haired Meena died.
In her place...

695
02:24:30,439 --> 02:24:33,931
was born a knife-wielding
vagabond. Meenu Master.

696
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:39,775
The lie isn't necessary.

697
02:24:46,021 --> 02:24:47,682
Here...

698
02:24:50,058 --> 02:24:51,719
What is it?

699
02:24:59,534 --> 02:25:01,729
The end of Raju and Minoo.

700
02:25:03,138 --> 02:25:06,801
Take off that old shirt
and rags and wear this.

701
02:25:07,909 --> 02:25:10,002
Enter the world
as your real self.

702
02:25:26,161 --> 02:25:31,929
After ages I feel
the softness of a sari on me.

703
02:25:34,102 --> 02:25:36,093
You may not believe it.

704
02:25:37,506 --> 02:25:41,943
But that tough Minoo master...

705
02:25:42,144 --> 02:25:44,271
...was once a
shy young girl.

706
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:51,544
I used to sing and dance.

707
02:25:52,988 --> 02:25:55,889
Everyone used to say
Meena is beautiful!

708
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:59,187
One day she'll be
a famous artist.

709
02:26:00,395 --> 02:26:04,889
She'll be known everywhere.
Fame will be hers.

710
02:26:06,968 --> 02:26:13,396
When she went out all dressed up
people would forgot their way.

711
02:26:35,063 --> 02:26:37,054
They were right.

712
02:26:37,299 --> 02:26:39,426
People will surely
forget their way.

713
02:26:41,570 --> 02:26:43,561
Now I have accepted the truth.

714
02:26:47,776 --> 02:26:53,942
I didn't know that when the
truth shone, it would dazzle.

715
02:26:56,451 --> 02:26:57,941
You are going?

716
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:00,452
Yes Meena, I'm leaving.

717
02:27:02,858 --> 02:27:05,952
- You'll leave me alone?
- You've lived alone.

718
02:27:06,461 --> 02:27:08,122
So can you now.

719
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:13,465
Minoo Master could live alone.
Meena cannot live on her own.

720
02:27:14,469 --> 02:27:18,997
You've transformed me from
Minoo to Meena. You can't leave.

721
02:27:20,475 --> 02:27:23,467
No, Meena...
Don't talk like that.

722
02:27:24,546 --> 02:27:28,073
I've always been hurt
in this game.

723
02:27:28,817 --> 02:27:30,478
It's a dangerous game.

724
02:27:33,488 --> 02:27:36,321
Don't consider my love
for you to be a game.

725
02:33:09,424 --> 02:33:13,588
You've swept the town off its
feet with your qawali, your song.

726
02:33:14,195 --> 02:33:17,926
On every one's lips are the
names of Meena and Raju.

727
02:33:18,433 --> 02:33:22,233
No, it's first Raju
and then Meena.

728
02:33:23,304 --> 02:33:25,431
First the guru then the pupil.

729
02:33:27,442 --> 02:33:33,438
No, Meena; qawali is like love.
There's no first or second.

730
02:33:34,215 --> 02:33:36,445
Two voices blend into one.

731
02:33:37,786 --> 02:33:40,778
Isn't it?
Don't believe me?

732
02:33:44,726 --> 02:33:46,455
Ask him.

733
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:55,062
- What is this?
- Don't you know?

734
02:33:56,738 --> 02:33:58,729
This is me, isn't it?

735
02:34:02,143 --> 02:34:03,405
It's a clown.

736
02:34:03,578 --> 02:34:05,773
Yes, a joker.
In other words me'.

737
02:34:05,947 --> 02:34:10,213
Hang him upside down. He'll still
laugh. Do anything he'll laugh.

738
02:34:10,585 --> 02:34:14,146
And if one embraces
him lovingly?

739
02:34:18,226 --> 02:34:22,287
- He'll still laugh.
- I'll keep him in my heart.

740
02:34:24,599 --> 02:34:26,590
Is there enough place?

741
02:34:29,304 --> 02:34:30,828
Yes, Raju.

742
02:34:39,848 --> 02:34:42,715
- Where is Moti?
- He's been taken to the dog-pound.

743
02:35:02,270 --> 02:35:04,135
Hang him upside down,
he'll still laugh.

744
02:35:05,139 --> 02:35:07,130
Do anything, he'll laugh.

745
02:35:08,977 --> 02:35:10,410
What's the matter, Raju?

746
02:35:10,578 --> 02:35:14,844
They've taken Moti away.
They'll put an end to his life.

747
02:35:15,016 --> 02:35:17,314
That's the fate of
stray dogs.

748
02:35:17,518 --> 02:35:20,510
He's not a stray dog.
He's a partner in our circus.

749
02:35:21,222 --> 02:35:25,420
We're finished with the circus.
We've got our qawali show now.

750
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:28,627
- There is no need for Moti.
- Need?

751
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:34,091
Do you love out of need?

752
02:35:35,703 --> 02:35:39,264
When you needed him you fed him,
gave him a bone.

753
02:35:39,774 --> 02:35:42,106
No more need, so you destroy him.

754
02:35:42,243 --> 02:35:43,642
Today, it's Moti and...

755
02:35:45,446 --> 02:35:47,175
Raju, forgive me!

756
02:35:47,916 --> 02:35:53,513
I didn't mean anything like that.
Don't be angry.

757
02:35:54,055 --> 02:35:57,252
Look, he's imploring you,
too, on my behalf.

758
02:36:02,397 --> 02:36:06,231
When a clown's angry, he
still laughs just like you.

759
02:36:15,009 --> 02:36:18,877
You're right. Meena.
A clown always keeps laughing.

760
02:36:20,548 --> 02:36:22,413
Under any circumstances.

761
02:36:43,771 --> 02:36:47,673
I greet you, the great
qawali singer, Raju.

762
02:36:47,842 --> 02:36:50,242
And of course,
the great Meena.

763
02:36:53,181 --> 02:36:57,277
- Who are you?
- Jannab Kala Narayan Dilgir.

764
02:36:57,452 --> 02:37:01,445
- A wise man, a learned man.
- Do sit down.

765
02:37:01,689 --> 02:37:07,650
The late Agha Hashrat was my teacher.
Unique in the art of drama.

766
02:37:07,929 --> 02:37:11,456
- Maybe he was. But you?
- Kindly listen.

767
02:37:11,666 --> 02:37:13,725
He owns a theatrical company.

768
02:37:16,371 --> 02:37:17,963
How can we help?

769
02:37:18,139 --> 02:37:23,076
If you both perform in our theater,
it will come alive.

770
02:37:23,344 --> 02:37:26,006
None will stand a chance.

771
02:37:26,647 --> 02:37:29,480
- I'll be the leading heroine?
- Of course!

772
02:37:30,885 --> 02:37:35,879
As soon as I saw your show,
I knew you were a born artist.

773
02:37:36,891 --> 02:37:40,292
Did you hear?
He said I'm a born artist.

774
02:37:42,163 --> 02:37:48,033
I'll present you on stage
in great splendour...

775
02:37:48,169 --> 02:37:51,434
- The world will be in awe.
- And why not! You're right.

776
02:37:51,606 --> 02:37:53,597
You are absolutely right, madam.

777
02:37:58,846 --> 02:38:02,907
Do you agree to
Rs. 500 per month?

778
02:38:03,251 --> 02:38:04,445
500?

779
02:38:04,619 --> 02:38:08,282
All right. Accept six hundred.
But no more qawali.

780
02:38:08,556 --> 02:38:11,719
No more singing?
How can that be possible?

781
02:38:12,460 --> 02:38:17,193
Think of this poor man. Who's
paid in advance for our show.

782
02:38:17,365 --> 02:38:19,356
What will become of him?

783
02:38:20,134 --> 02:38:22,125
There's no need.

784
02:38:25,940 --> 02:38:29,341
Now we will act on the
stage in the theatre.

785
02:38:29,744 --> 02:38:31,644
Well said, Miss Meena.

786
02:42:35,523 --> 02:42:39,186
Raju, did you see who
came to the show today?

787
02:42:39,527 --> 02:42:41,518
You'll be dizzy if you know.

788
02:43:02,516 --> 02:43:05,417
Meena, kindly garland
our chief guest.

789
02:43:33,447 --> 02:43:35,608
No amount of garlands
will suffice.

790
02:43:36,717 --> 02:43:38,446
Your dancing is unique.

791
02:43:38,619 --> 02:43:41,713
- Thank you, Mr. Kumar
- You know me?

792
02:43:42,056 --> 02:43:43,717
Who doesn't?

793
02:43:45,593 --> 02:43:49,461
Everyone knows me. But few
recognise who I really am.

794
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:56,666
I've been your admirer for a
long time. What brings you here?

795
02:43:57,405 --> 02:43:59,396
Aren't your studios in Bombay?

796
02:43:59,607 --> 02:44:03,873
I came to Madras to scout for
new talent for my next film.

797
02:44:05,312 --> 02:44:07,644
This way...
Can I talk to her?

798
02:44:13,154 --> 02:44:15,145
How would you like to work
with me in my next production?

799
02:44:16,590 --> 02:44:18,080
- Me?
- Yes!

800
02:44:19,593 --> 02:44:21,925
I want a new heroine, a new face.

801
02:44:22,163 --> 02:44:25,758
- I'll act opposite you?
- And why not?

802
02:44:26,534 --> 02:44:30,197
But first a screen test.
Can you come with me tomorrow?

803
02:44:30,438 --> 02:44:32,099
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

804
02:44:32,273 --> 02:44:35,003
Today's flight has left.
We'll send the ticket.

805
02:44:53,227 --> 02:44:55,627
Really? Will I really
be acting in a film?

806
02:45:00,468 --> 02:45:05,064
But not just one ticket. Two.
Raju will accompany me.

807
02:45:07,408 --> 02:45:11,401
Where have you been? I've been
looking for you. Where were you?

808
02:45:11,579 --> 02:45:14,571
Right near you.
You didn't turn to look.

809
02:45:15,282 --> 02:45:16,749
This is Raju.

810
02:45:22,423 --> 02:45:24,891
He's taught me everything I know.

811
02:45:26,193 --> 02:45:29,685
It's kind of her to say that.
How could I be so capable?

812
02:45:30,231 --> 02:45:32,426
On the contrary,
she's taught me much.

813
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:36,934
Raju, did you hear? Mr. Kumar is
going to give me a chance to act.

814
02:45:37,304 --> 02:45:39,295
We'll have to go
to Bombay tomorrow.

815
02:45:42,443 --> 02:45:44,434
What about the theatre?

816
02:45:44,645 --> 02:45:47,773
If I act in films, where's
the need of the theatre?

817
02:45:49,450 --> 02:45:52,715
Miss Meena, you'll receive
two tickets tomorrow.

818
02:45:54,221 --> 02:45:57,657
Remember one thing,
I don't believe in compromises.

819
02:45:58,392 --> 02:46:00,383
Work is work.
And feelings are feelings.

820
02:46:30,591 --> 02:46:32,582
Did I make a mistake?

821
02:46:34,261 --> 02:46:36,252
No, Meena.
You didn't make any mistake.

822
02:46:37,097 --> 02:46:39,429
What shall I do? Tell me.

823
02:46:41,435 --> 02:46:45,701
Do just as Mr. Kumar says.
Work, Meena.

824
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:49,202
Work is work...
and feelings are feelings.

825
02:46:53,547 --> 02:46:56,448
No one can hold you
back from flying.

826
02:46:57,918 --> 02:47:00,910
Fly high so that you
attain much celebrity status.

827
02:47:42,630 --> 02:47:44,689
Is Madam's make-up kit with you?

828
02:48:11,291 --> 02:48:13,885
Why look at me? Look over there.

829
02:48:20,534 --> 02:48:22,525
From here, too, I see you.

830
02:48:25,305 --> 02:48:29,708
Stop looking at others.
Try looking at yourself.

831
02:48:59,606 --> 02:49:03,702
- Did you call?
- Come in, Raju.

832
02:49:08,882 --> 02:49:10,440
Sit down.

833
02:49:11,218 --> 02:49:12,617
You may leave.

834
02:49:16,323 --> 02:49:19,986
Now, we can talk as friends...

835
02:49:21,195 --> 02:49:22,992
...who love the same art.

836
02:49:28,469 --> 02:49:30,460
Miss Meena praises you a lot.

837
02:49:31,338 --> 02:49:35,331
She says you're famous in the
circus and on stage. A poet-singer.

838
02:49:38,011 --> 02:49:42,141
But unfortunately I have
never seen any of your shows.

839
02:49:43,984 --> 02:49:47,147
You have. But you
didn't recognise me.

840
02:49:56,330 --> 02:49:59,424
- I'd like to ask you a question.
- Yes?

841
02:50:01,335 --> 02:50:03,098
You love Meena?

842
02:50:11,111 --> 02:50:13,102
You ask if I love Meena?

843
02:50:15,315 --> 02:50:19,251
That isn't the question.
It's do I love? '

844
02:50:20,320 --> 02:50:23,312
The answer is 'yes'
I do love...

845
02:50:24,057 --> 02:50:28,289
I love the world, children,
old people, women...

846
02:50:28,462 --> 02:50:30,794
I love men, flowers, stones...

847
02:50:36,737 --> 02:50:39,069
A flower called Meena?

848
02:50:42,476 --> 02:50:45,877
- Yes - Then I want to
tell you this.

849
02:50:50,484 --> 02:50:52,418
Meena is like an uncut diamond.

850
02:50:54,188 --> 02:50:56,179
A song that hasn't been sung.

851
02:50:57,858 --> 02:50:59,951
She can be a great artist.

852
02:51:02,830 --> 02:51:04,821
She can be a big film star.

853
02:51:06,433 --> 02:51:09,766
You mean that you can make her
into a big film star.

854
02:51:11,338 --> 02:51:16,105
Yes, I am interested in her because
I've seen an actress hidden in her.

855
02:51:17,244 --> 02:51:22,113
And if she gets the opportunity,
she'll emerge as a super star!

856
02:51:24,117 --> 02:51:26,108
But for that I will
have to work very hard.

857
02:51:28,922 --> 02:51:31,914
- And you... - Will have to
make a small sacrifice.

858
02:51:42,469 --> 02:51:46,963
You're a famous film star, you
can't understand a joker's feelings.

859
02:51:48,475 --> 02:51:51,410
No one can tie down
this restless wanderer.

860
02:51:52,412 --> 02:51:55,404
No gold, nor silver...
no love can do that.

861
02:51:59,219 --> 02:52:00,948
You're giving Meena a new life.

862
02:52:02,422 --> 02:52:06,950
Remember that giving someone a
new life entails responsibility.

863
02:52:09,329 --> 02:52:10,990
You're so right.

864
02:52:14,868 --> 02:52:20,101
At today's press conference,
I shall present Meena in public.

865
02:52:21,541 --> 02:52:24,169
You'll be there, too?

866
02:52:25,279 --> 02:52:29,010
Whether I'm there
or I'm not there...

867
02:52:29,349 --> 02:52:31,783
Meena will be there on time.

868
02:54:02,409 --> 02:54:08,211
Who is the person
behind your success?

869
02:54:15,222 --> 02:54:17,213
I will answer this question?

870
02:54:17,491 --> 02:54:21,655
There is an unusual wanderer
who is responsible for her success.

871
02:54:22,596 --> 02:54:26,589
Even today, he must be perhaps
wandering all alone!

872
03:01:21,848 --> 03:01:24,908
Thank you! Thank you very much

873
03:01:28,521 --> 03:01:33,857
Now we shall have an interval.

874
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:37,787
Yes, this is an interval.

875
03:01:38,465 --> 03:01:44,597
The interval could last
15 minutes, 15 hours, 15 months.

876
03:01:45,038 --> 03:01:47,802
But the clown's show
will never be over.

877
03:01:48,074 --> 03:01:50,542
The joker's act isn't over.

878
03:01:50,743 --> 03:01:53,803
Don't go! My act isn't over.

879
03:01:54,080 --> 03:01:56,742
Don't go away. Don't leave!
