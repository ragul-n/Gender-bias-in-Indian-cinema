1
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:18,589
Open up!

2
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:23,029
Or we'll break the door,
And then, we'll break you.

3
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,085
So you're studying, eh?

4
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,120
You love to study, don't you?

5
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:59,365
You'll make your
parents proud, eh?

6
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:05,069
What the hell's going
on!? - l'll explain

7
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:07,363
l'll explain...

8
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:13,479
Take your pants off...

9
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,414
Come on, take your pants off...

10
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:23,489
Are you deaf!?

11
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,293
Worm!

12
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,126
Point a finger at me, will you!?

13
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:39,637
Pick him up!

14
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:42,397
Pick him up!

15
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:46,437
l'll open your pants...

16
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:47,707
Strip the bastard naked.

17
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:57,355
Act tough with me, will you?

18
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:01,083
Say you're sorry...say it!

19
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,959
Strip him...strip him completely...

20
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,530
Today l'll fix you!

21
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:06,181
Lick this shit like a dog.

22
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,627
No please...

23
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,140
Tie him to the window.

24
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,106
Tie him to the window.

25
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:30,375
Teach him a lesson.

26
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:32,955
l'm Sharat Saxena

27
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,634
l'm not only the
Warden of this Hostel,

28
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:43,602
l also teach in the university.

29
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:47,404
l'll be teaching you
for the next four years.

30
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,138
lt'll be my pleasure Sir.

31
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:54,050
Shantaram! Show him his room.

32
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,089
Thank you Sir.

33
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,412
lf you need anything,

34
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:26,141
Just let me know.

35
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:26,913
Ok.

36
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,468
Your name?

37
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:57,079
Karan.

38
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,577
Where've you come from?

39
00:08:59,018 --> 00:08:59,882
Mumbai.

40
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,351
Pay up 2000 bucks.

41
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:03,418
For what?

42
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,068
Any problem son?

43
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:19,566
No Sir.

44
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,368
He's refusing to pay the rent.

45
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:24,272
See son,

46
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:27,877
You've got to spend
four years here.

47
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,342
We'll all take good care of you.

48
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:39,621
You understand, don't you?

49
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:42,584
Sir, he's defying you too.

50
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,055
He's new around here.

51
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,564
You should understand that.

52
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:53,000
He'll understand everything soon.

53
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,670
Come on, everyone out!

54
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,069
let him settle down,

55
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:01,645
Out everyone!

56
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:08,107
Thank God they are gone.

57
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,605
The bastards!

58
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:16,181
l'm Vishnu Pandey,

59
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,580
your room mate.

60
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:20,950
l'm in first year, Engineering.

61
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:22,925
Karan.

62
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:27,364
Don't worry,

63
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,732
All this happens.

64
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,999
Tolerate it for four years, then
take your degree and get out.

65
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,106
Come,

66
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:39,978
l'll introduce you to my friends.

67
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:40,705
Come.

68
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,240
This is Nilesh.

69
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,149
This is Bobby.

70
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:47,448
Bobby's a major sportsman,...
Be careful of him.

71
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:48,884
And this is Karan.

72
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,479
What time is dinner served here?

73
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:54,019
Never before 9 p.m.

74
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,357
Are you really hungry?

75
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:57,526
Don't worry.

76
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,030
3 hours will pass quickly.

77
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,229
Walk, you fatso!
- l'm walking...

78
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,281
We get only vegetarian food here.

79
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:24,550
They cook well.

80
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:27,120
But they use too much oil.

81
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,386
That's very fattening.

82
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:34,031
Anyway, l'm on a diet these days.

83
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:54,682
Eat it now.

84
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:22,314
Feroz Sir,

85
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,250
He's refusing to pay
the rent for his room.

86
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:12,390
lf l see this guy
eating in the mess,

87
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,234
l'll beat you up right there.

88
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,064
Yes Sir, yes Sir.

89
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:40,114
So you're starving, eh?

90
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:46,529
l'll give you some water first.

91
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:20,530
Drink this.

92
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,304
Drink it.

93
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:19,486
Akshay, Stop it!

94
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,026
Be careful.

95
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:24,153
Don't fracture his bones.

96
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,925
lt could become a
criminal offence.

97
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:27,158
Beat him carefully.

98
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:31,135
What're you waiting for?

99
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:40,310
Karan,

100
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,409
l hope you've reached safely.

101
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,178
Yes.

102
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,076
What's wrong with your voice?

103
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,285
Nothing Uncle, nothing...

104
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,017
Are you alright son?

105
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,323
Uncle, l'm perfectly alright.

106
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,021
l hope you've been
allotted a room

107
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:58,192
Yes.

108
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:01,392
Are you getting proper food?

109
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,663
Yeah, the food's good here.

110
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,567
Fine, Take care...

111
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:20,076
Bye now, don't forget to call...

112
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,048
Fine.

113
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:16,902
The bastards!

114
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:30,549
This is for you.

115
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,168
Have it.

116
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:03,084
Thanks.

117
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,617
Why doesn't anyone oppose Feroz?

118
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:11,861
Because he's the General
Secretary of the University.

119
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,362
That guy? He's the
General Secretary?

120
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,559
Yes, everyone fears him.

121
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,859
All these guys are
28 or 30 years old.

122
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,635
Feroz is 30 years old.

123
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,667
And he's still a student.

124
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:25,871
See, there's a difference.

125
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:27,573
We are here to study,

126
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,912
But their motives are different.

127
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:34,375
Feroz fails every
year on purpose,

128
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:36,420
His years in the university...

129
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,487
...have made him influential.

130
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:42,350
That's how he became
General Secretary.

131
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:44,896
He's backed by the State Govt.

132
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:49,997
He'll be absorbed
into their Party.

133
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:51,998
And he'll enter State Politics.

134
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,431
That's his ambition.

135
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,939
He's using the university
as a stepping stone,

136
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,199
...to enter State Politics.

137
00:19:57,276 --> 00:19:59,073
And he enjoys all luxuries here,

138
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:03,305
We do his laundry and cleaning,

139
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:05,047
And he extorts money from us too.

140
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:06,516
He won't get such luxury outside.

141
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,577
That's why...

142
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,251
...he doesn't want
to leave the Hostel.

143
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,352
But...

144
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:13,549
Forget it.

145
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,287
lt's time for the lectures.

146
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:20,961
Come...

147
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:28,371
The term just began,

148
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,032
But the Tests are already on.

149
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,168
Are you prepared?

150
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:33,569
No.

151
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:35,979
You Karan?

152
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:36,704
No.

153
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,140
You've joined the Term late.

154
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:42,420
We're going to the library...

155
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,120
See you...

156
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,425
ls the time table out?

157
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:48,926
Let's check...

158
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,030
How're you boys?

159
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,358
Everything's alright?

160
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,566
l hope you have no problem

161
00:20:58,537 --> 00:20:59,902
Very good.

162
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:04,242
You've got a Test day after?

163
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,400
Are you prepared?

164
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:08,508
Don't worry, l'll help you.

165
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:09,673
Come.

166
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,586
lf have any problem,

167
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:25,561
lf have any problem,

168
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:27,956
Walk straight into my office.

169
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:49,614
Are you confident
that you'll pass?

170
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:52,419
No Sir.

171
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:56,125
And you?

172
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,899
See, l can leak...

173
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:15,345
...the Test papers to you.

174
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:20,480
lt'll cost only Rs. 10,000.

175
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:25,152
We don't have that much money.

176
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,288
Don't have the money?

177
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,393
Get up! Get up and get out!

178
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,316
What now?

179
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,911
l'm not prepared at all.

180
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,990
We'll study together,

181
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,258
We'll make it.

182
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:12,035
Open up!

183
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:16,965
He's shitting bricks!

184
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,108
Four Eyes!

185
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:28,917
Why're you afraid?

186
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:33,150
We've stripped
you so many times,...

187
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,184
We've come for him.

188
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:40,591
Get up!

189
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:01,882
Take your clothes off.

190
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:08,023
Take off your pants.

191
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,462
Take it off!

192
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,295
He's a pretty boy,...

193
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,275
Do it, or else...

194
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:32,078
Please spare us today,...

195
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,084
We have a Test day after,...

196
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:42,650
All we want is a Cabaret dance.

197
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:47,454
Four Eyes! Put the stereo on...

198
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:14,952
Do a striptease,...

199
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:19,987
Strip...

200
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,127
He's pretty...

201
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:42,043
The more you resist,

202
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,913
The more you'll suffer.

203
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:45,718
Entertain us nicely,

204
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:47,655
And we'll leave you alone.

205
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:48,624
Ask him,...

206
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:50,890
He's done it so many times.

207
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:54,996
lt's nothing,...

208
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,432
We've all done it.

209
00:25:57,102 --> 00:26:00,094
Just do it.

210
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:11,611
Feeling shy?

211
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,447
We'll fix that.

212
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:22,524
We'll make you shameless.

213
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,638
Look at him!

214
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,942
A freshman in our college!

215
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,219
We explained the rules to him,

216
00:27:57,522 --> 00:27:59,649
But this mannerless duffer...

217
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:00,992
...is stubborn.

218
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:06,222
He has no regard for his seniors.

219
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:08,431
We explained to him,

220
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:12,993
...that this is just an initiation.

221
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:16,307
But he doesn't understand.

222
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:18,239
We explained to him,

223
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:22,277
That your seniors
are your parents.

224
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:26,577
So why feel shy of us?

225
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:29,042
But now he won't feel shy!

226
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,358
He'll become tough!

227
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:37,927
He'll get ready
to face the world.

228
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:40,895
We're doing you a favour,

229
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,164
You won't understand today,

230
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,560
You'll appreciate us later.

231
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:50,432
For turning you into a Man.

232
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,107
Staring at me?

233
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:12,062
The Show's over!

234
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:13,887
Back to your Hostels!

235
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,085
Karan, you failed the Test?

236
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:47,489
But you were always
a bright student,...

237
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,000
What's the matter?

238
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,264
Absolutely nothing Uncle...

239
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,396
Are you hiding something from me?

240
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,437
Uncle, stop fussing over me,

241
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:57,907
l can take care of myself!

242
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:10,148
See Karan, This is
between you and them.

243
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:12,215
We can't interfere.

244
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,258
But Sir, l can't
concentrate on my studies.

245
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:15,486
l'm a merit list student,

246
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,255
l've never failed before.

247
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,158
Maybe you could...

248
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,296
...seek accommodation elsewhere?

249
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:25,200
Sir, l don't have the money.

250
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:37,081
See, these guys are hooligans.

251
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:39,574
l understand your problem,

252
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:41,953
But there's nothing l can do.

253
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:43,978
l'm really sorry Karan.

254
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,624
What can you do against them?

255
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,999
They enjoy doing all this.

256
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:02,199
They are bloody Sadists!

257
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,533
They are a gang of 20 ruffians,

258
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:08,937
You'll fight them all alone?

259
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:12,544
Even if you beat up one of them,

260
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:14,913
Tomorrow they'll hit back,

261
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:16,977
Then again you'll hit back,

262
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:19,481
This is a never- ending story.

263
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:26,494
lt's best to forget it.

264
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,357
lt's not easy.

265
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:35,265
You've failed in the Test,

266
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:40,501
Now the mid- term
Exams are coming.

267
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:45,240
You can't waste you time on this.

268
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:49,147
You'll fail and lose a year.

269
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:53,448
After the exams,

270
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:56,359
Take your revenge!

271
00:31:56,595 --> 00:32:00,326
No, forget about it.

272
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:03,566
At least, till the exams.

273
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:06,694
Why don't you try...

274
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:09,368
...spending more
time in the library?

275
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,439
You'll avoid these guys.

276
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:12,665
Good idea.

277
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:15,105
These illiterates
won't even know...

278
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,145
...if there is a library at all!

279
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:04,889
Excuse me...

280
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:07,624
Are you alright?

281
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:13,104
Yeah, yeah, l'm
perfectly alright.

282
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:14,702
l thought you were crying.

283
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,033
Are you in Engineering?

284
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:31,515
l've taken science,

285
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,958
Engineering must be even tougher.

286
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:36,716
How do you guys manage?

287
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:40,159
The difficult part
is not the studies.

288
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:41,360
Why?

289
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,064
Do you live in the Boy's Hostel?

290
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:45,694
Yeah.

291
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:48,865
l've heard stories
about the Boy's Hostel,...

292
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,164
Are they true?

293
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:52,967
No, not really...

294
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:54,236
Are you sure?

295
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,172
Yeah.

296
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:59,478
Are your seniors harassing you?

297
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:01,175
Of course not!

298
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:04,250
What're you doing here this late?

299
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:07,519
l was collecting some notes.

300
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:12,596
You came here to study?

301
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:15,132
That was the intention,
before you turned up.

302
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:17,426
Just joking.

303
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:19,364
By the way, l'm Payal.

304
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:21,268
Karan.

305
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:41,455
Enough bitching about professors!

306
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:43,651
l better get going, it's late...

307
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:52,294
Payal, it was really
nice talking to you.

308
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:55,039
Same here.

309
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,568
What're you doing tomorrow?

310
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:03,675
l've got classes
and then tuitions.

311
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:06,549
And day after?

312
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,047
Nothing really.

313
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,017
You want to meet up then?

314
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:22,524
Ok.

315
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:25,027
Ok, see you then.

316
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:26,234
See you.

317
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:38,015
Hey, by the way,...

318
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,283
You've got really nice eyes.

319
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:47,650
Thanks.

320
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:08,276
So, what's your family like?

321
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:11,074
l don't have one.

322
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:14,510
My parents passed
away, years ago.

323
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,416
l didn't like
living with my uncle.

324
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:22,250
He's a good man.

325
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,623
But he has his own family.

326
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:32,696
l don't like being
a burden on him.

327
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,102
l have no place to go to
except for this Hostel.

328
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,206
Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

329
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:42,040
No.

330
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:43,141
You?

331
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:45,077
l'm the only child.

332
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,542
l wish l had an elder brother,

333
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:50,611
Someone who could protect me,

334
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:53,346
But it's ok now,

335
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,152
You're like my brother.

336
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:56,323
No way!

337
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,287
Where've you been?

338
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:25,647
l've been around.

339
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:28,524
Why're you so happy today?

340
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,884
You want him to be unhappy?

341
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,621
There's something, for sure...

342
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,132
Tell us, what is it?

343
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:37,533
Nothing guys...

344
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:41,494
This is the first time
we've seen you smiling.

345
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:43,630
Found someone?

346
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:47,511
He's found a girl!

347
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:51,076
No. We're just friends.

348
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:55,844
So, there is a girl!

349
00:37:58,323 --> 00:37:59,517
What's her name?

350
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:03,291
Payal.

351
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:07,454
Did you do anything?

352
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:08,929
Grow up guys.

353
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:13,001
Don't feel shy, tell us...

354
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:15,662
We want a treat.

355
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,406
You guys don't understand
We're just friends.

356
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:20,876
We still want a treat.

357
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:27,510
Let's go to the Cafe,...

358
00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:29,114
Ok.

359
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:36,151
But this time, l'll pay.
- No way.

360
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:38,889
l'll pay this time,
you always pay.

361
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:41,261
l can at least do
that much for you.

362
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:44,626
All juniors to the Auditorium...

363
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:50,535
Come on...

364
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,149
But Karan,

365
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:04,216
lf you can't defend yourself,

366
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:06,881
How can l feel safe with you?

367
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,490
Payal, l just...

368
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:16,865
Why didn't you come
to the Auditorium?

369
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,027
All juniors had come.

370
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,930
We stripped all of them naked.

371
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:23,332
They did a nude parade.

372
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:24,530
Are you special?

373
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,138
Should we strip you here?

374
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:31,242
Like the other day?

375
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:38,011
l've a new routine for you.

376
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,314
See that girl?

377
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:45,254
Go, smooch her.

378
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,134
Go or we'll strip you again.

379
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:57,505
Don't worry...

380
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:58,937
She can't retaliate.

381
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:03,113
She has no clout.

382
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:08,243
Anyway, we'll protect you.

383
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:14,483
Go now, smooch her.

384
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:20,459
Why? Because she's not yours?

385
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:25,662
She's yours, right?

386
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:27,369
Smooch her.

387
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:31,507
You smooch her in private, right?

388
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,269
Show us how you do it.

389
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:43,720
lf you don't smooch her,

390
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,382
We will.

391
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:12,501
Stop them, stop them please!

392
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:08,989
Wait you bastard!

393
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:16,205
We'll strip you naked!

394
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,705
We'll parade you around town!

395
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:41,687
Feroz Sir...

396
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:45,591
Feroz Sir...

397
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:58,074
Who raped you?

398
00:43:58,149 --> 00:43:59,275
You're laughing?

399
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,686
Actually l should cry.

400
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:14,491
Who hit you?

401
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:20,301
That...Karan.

402
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:24,336
You got beaten by a junior?

403
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:28,270
You know what you are?

404
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:33,974
What's that word?

405
00:44:34,518 --> 00:44:35,951
Liability.

406
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:37,951
Correct.

407
00:44:38,255 --> 00:44:39,654
Will you just joke about it?

408
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:43,483
Won't you do anything?

409
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,256
Stop whining.

410
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:04,348
Yeah, Ayoob...

411
00:45:25,903 --> 00:45:27,996
Don't spare the bastard!

412
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:46,681
Out of the way!

413
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:52,256
Where's he?

414
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:53,296
On the terrace.

415
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:02,064
These guys are as
human as we are...

416
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,968
And we have the
advantage of numbers!

417
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:06,133
Why should we fear them?

418
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:08,973
You don't understand,

419
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:10,445
...the kind of contacts they have!

420
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:38,632
Who's Karan?

421
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:51,020
Who's Ayoob?

422
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:01,292
l know you've come
to rough me up.

423
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:04,161
But remember...

424
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:05,463
Even if you do beat me up,

425
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:07,663
lt'll be a disgrace to you.

426
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:09,236
People will say...

427
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,932
Ayoob is now Feroz's stoogie!

428
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,017
What'd you say?

429
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:24,284
What do you have against me?

430
00:47:24,588 --> 00:47:26,146
We don't even know each other!

431
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:28,157
Feroz is using you!

432
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:29,384
He's fooling you!

433
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:31,959
He's using you as a Front!

434
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:44,065
But if you still wish to
fight, just for Feroz's sake,

435
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:45,165
Then go ahead!

436
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:46,470
But remember...

437
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,974
That time they were six
too, And l was alone.

438
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:00,117
He's right actually.

439
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:13,529
Feroz said there's a tough goon...

440
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:15,401
...who beat up his boys.

441
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:18,175
But he's just a simple boy.

442
00:48:23,013 --> 00:48:24,537
Feroz is using us.

443
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:30,349
We aren't his servants.

444
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:33,887
Let's go back.

445
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:35,417
l said...let's go...

446
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:36,424
But...

447
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,485
Don't think we've chickened out.

448
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:13,858
l just liked what you said.

449
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:18,100
lf you ever have any
problem, let us know.

450
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,030
You must've said
the same to Feroz.

451
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:22,963
Thanks for your offer,

452
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,171
But l won't need it.

453
00:49:38,555 --> 00:49:39,886
Stubborn fellow...

454
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:56,301
Feroz Sir...
- l know!

455
00:49:57,341 --> 00:49:59,571
Let's cut the bastard up!

456
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,506
Why?

457
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:03,204
For our gang's prestige.

458
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:05,542
Who says you're in our gang?

459
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:10,244
But why?

460
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:12,221
For our gang's prestige.

461
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:19,425
First, you got beaten in public...

462
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:24,592
Then l gave you backing,

463
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:27,364
Yet you couldn't fix that kid.

464
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:31,631
Having you around is
bad for my reputation.

465
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:33,209
Feroz Sir...

466
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:36,137
You have 24 hours.

467
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:40,116
Pack your bags.

468
00:50:40,184 --> 00:50:40,741
But...

469
00:50:40,984 --> 00:50:41,973
After that,

470
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:47,213
if l ever see you again,

471
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:57,329
l'll finish what's left of you.

472
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,669
Feroz Sir...!

473
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:16,081
What's that boy's name?

474
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:16,585
Karan.

475
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,712
Which is his room?

476
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:19,718
The last one...

477
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:26,653
What melodrama!

478
00:51:27,197 --> 00:51:28,960
You should act in movies.

479
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,301
Why study Engineering?

480
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:33,702
He'll get a role easily,

481
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:35,598
Because he's a pretty boy.

482
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,538
See,

483
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:44,471
Akshay worked for me.

484
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:47,710
But you beat him hands down.

485
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:50,478
Which means...

486
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:52,950
...that you're more useful.

487
00:51:53,957 --> 00:51:57,051
l'll pay you Rs. 3000 a month.

488
00:51:57,561 --> 00:51:58,585
l'm here to study,

489
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:00,427
Not to be a hooligan.

490
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:10,539
You have balls.

491
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:15,138
But not enough to stand up to us.

492
00:52:19,016 --> 00:52:23,453
lt's not a knife this time.

493
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:30,019
l admit one thing,

494
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:32,088
That you're a man.

495
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,090
They are pansies.

496
00:52:37,067 --> 00:52:40,036
That's why you
deserve some respect.

497
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,330
l won't strip you now.

498
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:50,135
You aren't joining us,

499
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:52,105
No problem.

500
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:54,408
We don't really need you.

501
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:57,415
But...

502
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:01,223
Don't ever meddle in our affairs.

503
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,093
Pretend that you're deaf & blind.

504
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:11,423
Otherwise you could...

505
00:53:13,904 --> 00:53:16,202
...actually turn deaf & blind.

506
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:22,496
Pick it up.

507
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,238
Take the remote too.

508
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,938
That's my TV!

509
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:29,906
We know it's yours.

510
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,379
We'll return it in a few months.

511
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:33,444
This is my 'protection' fee.

512
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:28,234
Why do you tolerate this?

513
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:30,233
Don't you have any self- respect?

514
00:55:31,975 --> 00:55:34,102
All this is a way of life...

515
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:37,403
lt happens to everyone.

516
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:39,170
lt's a pass- time.

517
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:42,144
They just joke around with us.

518
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:44,579
We actually enjoy it.

519
00:56:03,874 --> 00:56:05,398
The suppliers are very happy.

520
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:08,603
Our Hostel is the best market,

521
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:12,914
So many customers for
Dope under one roof.

522
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:40,501
lf you need anything,

523
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,333
Just let me know.

524
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:09,365
Come on inside...

525
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:24,145
Your Name?

526
00:58:24,814 --> 00:58:25,644
Pawan.

527
00:58:29,786 --> 00:58:30,514
Your Name?

528
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:41,091
We're your seniors.

529
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:44,222
Address us as 'Sir'

530
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:50,137
Yes or No?

531
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:52,799
Yes.

532
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,473
Say Yes 'Sir'

533
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:05,553
lt's your first day.

534
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,417
So we'll end it here.

535
00:59:09,726 --> 00:59:12,593
Wait and watch now.

536
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:16,465
You haven't met Feroz yet.

537
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:24,097
Let's go...

538
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:05,405
First year?

539
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:09,514
Yeah.

540
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:16,290
Engineering?

541
01:00:17,627 --> 01:00:18,389
Yes.

542
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:20,559
And you?

543
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:21,792
Second year.

544
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:23,497
l'm Karan.

545
01:00:24,634 --> 01:00:25,566
Pawan.

546
01:00:27,103 --> 01:00:28,297
Faced any trouble as yet?

547
01:00:30,106 --> 01:00:31,801
No...

548
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,271
lf anyone troubles
you, let me know.

549
01:00:35,345 --> 01:00:37,711
You'll be able to help me?

550
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:40,783
Good question...

551
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:46,721
Excuse me...

552
01:00:52,562 --> 01:00:54,427
Yeah Payal...

553
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:57,332
l was waiting for your call.

554
01:00:58,101 --> 01:00:59,625
l'll see you in five minutes.

555
01:01:05,742 --> 01:01:07,266
Nice meeting you, see you around.

556
01:01:09,045 --> 01:01:09,636
Bye.

557
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:23,626
Can you bunk college
for a day or two?

558
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:25,386
l wouldn't want to.

559
01:01:25,795 --> 01:01:26,454
But why?

560
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:28,224
l want to go
outstation somewhere.

561
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:29,629
For a picnic or something.

562
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:31,227
But only the two of us.

563
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:32,595
What'll you tell your dad?

564
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:35,204
l'll tell him it's
a college picnic.

565
01:01:35,638 --> 01:01:37,128
You Hostelites are lucky.

566
01:01:37,474 --> 01:01:39,408
No one restricts you.

567
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:45,045
Tell me Karan, can
we go for a trip?

568
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:49,251
Payal, l'm broke.

569
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:50,643
Don't worry.

570
01:01:51,121 --> 01:01:52,748
Just tell me whether
you'll come or not?

571
01:02:11,674 --> 01:02:12,402
Karan...

572
01:02:14,244 --> 01:02:15,575
Will you marry me?

573
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:18,314
What's so funny?

574
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:24,078
That you ask me the
same question everyday.

575
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:26,045
l like to hear it from you.

576
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:29,117
Do you like to hear it?
Or you don't trust me?

577
01:02:29,259 --> 01:02:30,055
Both.

578
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,321
After graduation, l'll
do my post-graduation.

579
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:39,033
Then l'll get a good job.

580
01:02:39,536 --> 01:02:40,764
Then l'll be able to
afford a home. Then,...

581
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:42,562
l can't wait that long.

582
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,704
Payal, time flies...

583
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:48,200
One year's already gone by.

584
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:49,539
Did you realize?

585
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:55,115
Soon ten years will
pass, then twenty...

586
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:58,415
That time, we'll fondly
remember these days.

587
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,570
Hey Fresher, how're you?

588
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,272
Show me your cell phone.

589
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:32,677
l'll return it in a week.

590
01:03:34,023 --> 01:03:37,117
l said l'll return it in a week.

591
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:38,388
But...

592
01:03:40,396 --> 01:03:42,159
lf you argue,

593
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:44,489
You won't get it back.

594
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:48,365
Don't whine then.

595
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:52,537
We've wasted enough time.

596
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:53,768
Let's go...

597
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:03,609
Where're you taking me?

598
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:05,452
Let me go, please...

599
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:08,216
We're taking you to meet God!

600
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:10,285
He'll give you a holy wafer too!

601
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:57,464
Smoke this...

602
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:02,537
No Sir, l don't want to...

603
01:05:04,514 --> 01:05:05,344
Try it.

604
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:23,092
He's delicate.

605
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,361
He's never smoked a cigarette.

606
01:05:28,237 --> 01:05:29,727
Drugs before Cigarettes!

607
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,133
lt's like graduating
before school.

608
01:05:53,563 --> 01:05:56,293
ln these four years,
You'll become a man.

609
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:58,957
You'll get used to everything.

610
01:06:12,215 --> 01:06:14,149
Take this. The
fever will come down.

611
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:31,064
lf you need
anything, Let me know.

612
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,595
Go to sleep now.

613
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:44,706
Come, let's fool around
with that Fresher...

614
01:06:44,781 --> 01:06:46,271
Yeah, it'll be fun...

615
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:49,209
Who do you guys think you are?

616
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,624
What did you do to Pawan?

617
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:03,725
Go on, hit me!

618
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,998
l thought you were
my best friend.

619
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,302
But hit me!

620
01:07:08,504 --> 01:07:09,994
for the sake of that Fresher.

621
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:10,732
Aye Karan...

622
01:07:11,641 --> 01:07:13,108
Who are you picking on?

623
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:21,574
Have you forgotten how
much he's helped you?

624
01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:29,213
You won't get a friend like him.

625
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:36,429
Sorry Vishnu, really sorry pal
But what's happened to you guys?

626
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,032
What do you mean!?

627
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:40,669
We suffered it for a whole year!

628
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:43,766
Now it's our turn!

629
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:47,366
We've earned the
right to do this!

630
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:52,436
Karan, you're an old friend.

631
01:07:53,116 --> 01:07:54,447
Why are you confronting us?

632
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:56,608
For the sake of that Fresher?

633
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:58,152
lt's not about that boy!

634
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:00,118
lt's about doing what's right!

635
01:08:00,389 --> 01:08:02,016
lf you guys are my
friends, lt doesn't mean,...

636
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:03,649
...that l'll support you blindly.

637
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:07,061
Why're you taking
this so seriously?

638
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,592
We're just having some fun.

639
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:09,392
Fun?

640
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:11,433
You call that fun? Have
you seen his condition!?

641
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:13,560
We're making him a Man!

642
01:08:17,373 --> 01:08:19,034
See, he's delicate...

643
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:21,736
He won't survive the world.

644
01:08:22,645 --> 01:08:25,045
We are preparing him.

645
01:08:25,548 --> 01:08:27,413
We're doing him a favour.

646
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:32,043
l don't know what to say.

647
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:33,353
Chill Karan.

648
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:35,820
You're making an
issue out of nothing.

649
01:08:37,093 --> 01:08:37,684
And...

650
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,058
You guys've been
licking Feroz's ass!

651
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:42,595
Mind your tongue!

652
01:08:43,699 --> 01:08:45,394
We are his friends!

653
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:47,163
Akshay was his friend too!

654
01:08:47,803 --> 01:08:48,792
Grow up Karan.

655
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,170
You look at things
in black and white.

656
01:08:54,777 --> 01:08:58,577
You've to learn to see
the greys in between!

657
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:00,207
He's right.

658
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,982
Feroz protects us!

659
01:09:06,122 --> 01:09:07,783
He won't understand.

660
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:14,428
But Feroz is the
Crocodile of our pond.

661
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:21,100
l've only one friend here.

662
01:09:58,708 --> 01:09:59,675
This is my Hostel.

663
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:01,039
Lot of kids stay here.

664
01:10:02,345 --> 01:10:05,337
Students from all years.

665
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:07,582
Come...

666
01:10:12,722 --> 01:10:14,121
Why're you clinging?

667
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:15,655
What else am l here for?

668
01:10:15,992 --> 01:10:17,118
Come...

669
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:19,055
Feroz...

670
01:10:19,128 --> 01:10:20,618
What if someone sees you?

671
01:10:20,796 --> 01:10:24,254
l'll pluck out his eyes.

672
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:31,363
Call that pretty Fresher.

673
01:10:31,574 --> 01:10:32,802
We'll have some fun.

674
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:37,811
Will you screw everyone?

675
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:41,083
What else am l here for?

676
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,308
Hey Fatso...

677
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:45,450
Come, all of you.

678
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:57,125
Feroz Sir wants you to join him.

679
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,723
Please let me go Sir...

680
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:01,260
l don't want to go Sir.

681
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:30,998
Have you done it before?

682
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:35,294
No Feroz Sir, not yet.

683
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:50,780
She has undressed already.

684
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:54,283
And you're getting nervous.

685
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:00,360
You're getting the first lay.

686
01:12:00,629 --> 01:12:01,755
And you're still not happy.

687
01:12:01,997 --> 01:12:02,986
Come on, Strip...

688
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,995
Feroz Sir hates
disobedient students.

689
01:12:08,738 --> 01:12:13,368
Obey or you'll be punished.

690
01:12:15,244 --> 01:12:17,769
Feroz Sir, what
about a condom? -No.

691
01:12:18,314 --> 01:12:23,752
l doubt if he's capable.

692
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:29,257
Who's it at this hour?

693
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:34,353
Go and see...

694
01:12:35,664 --> 01:12:39,725
Say that l'm tutoring you guys.

695
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,469
Last minute tutoring, say that.

696
01:12:42,638 --> 01:12:45,106
This is an education of a kind,
isn't it? - Of course.

697
01:13:00,289 --> 01:13:01,950
So Mr. Nice Guy...

698
01:13:03,559 --> 01:13:05,117
What's your problem now?

699
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:08,089
There's a limit to everything.

700
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:09,219
Let him go.

701
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,397
ls he your brother!?

702
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:18,098
l'd warned you!

703
01:13:18,174 --> 01:13:20,369
Never to meddle in my affairs!

704
01:13:24,513 --> 01:13:26,538
You're staring at me?

705
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:27,980
Feel like hitting me?

706
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:29,206
Hit me!

707
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:34,350
Come on, hit me!

708
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,691
See
- no knife, no gun!

709
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,161
Come on, hit me!

710
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:06,107
Back to the room!

711
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:46,771
You can bully us,

712
01:16:48,117 --> 01:16:49,243
But Feroz beat you black & blue.

713
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:51,183
Don't taunt him.

714
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:54,679
What does that boy mean to you?

715
01:16:55,557 --> 01:16:59,584
You mind your own business.

716
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:01,992
Why meddle in other's affairs?

717
01:17:02,564 --> 01:17:05,260
l don't want anyone else
to suffer like l did.

718
01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:07,363
He can't defend himself,

719
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,437
...and he talks of
defending others.

720
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:13,339
Enough of your Mr. Nice Guy act.

721
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:17,579
That looks good only
in lndian Movies.

722
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:20,345
Sorry for quoting
one more cliche.

723
01:17:20,582 --> 01:17:23,949
But when in Rome,
do as Romans do.

724
01:17:27,556 --> 01:17:29,456
But l don't want this.

725
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:33,689
l didn't ask you what you want.

726
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,361
l want...

727
01:17:36,732 --> 01:17:37,994
...Rs. 5000.

728
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,001
Urgently.

729
01:17:41,236 --> 01:17:46,230
You can smoke this.
Or you can sell it.

730
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:51,644
This is like Gold.

731
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:54,544
lts value goes up everyday.

732
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:58,451
Feroz Sir says
- take it. So take it!

733
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,084
He's not extorting
money from you.

734
01:18:02,357 --> 01:18:04,450
You're getting that
stuff in return.

735
01:18:06,595 --> 01:18:11,294
Quickly... l'm getting late.

736
01:18:11,767 --> 01:18:15,328
You heard the man? Quickly now!

737
01:18:18,273 --> 01:18:20,468
But where did the money go?

738
01:18:21,376 --> 01:18:22,001
Papa, l...

739
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:24,238
You blew Rs. 5000 in a week?

740
01:18:24,313 --> 01:18:26,213
Where did you spend it?

741
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:29,541
Papa, books...

742
01:18:29,618 --> 01:18:32,553
Have you gotten addicted to
something? - Papa, no...

743
01:18:32,621 --> 01:18:34,714
Pawan, money doesn't
grow on trees.

744
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,725
l work hard for it.

745
01:18:38,026 --> 01:18:40,620
On the other hand, Your
mother has put me through hell.

746
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:43,263
She's sleeping with her boss.

747
01:18:43,499 --> 01:18:46,161
And her father is after my life,

748
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:48,835
They are demanding
alimony from me.

749
01:18:49,204 --> 01:18:50,569
Where'll l get the money from?

750
01:18:50,739 --> 01:18:53,367
You've scored very
badly in your Test.

751
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:54,476
lf you lose a year,

752
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:56,636
Where'll l get the
money for your fees?

753
01:18:56,712 --> 01:18:58,680
You have the money
to drink everyday.

754
01:18:59,248 --> 01:19:01,239
But you crib about my fees.

755
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:05,750
Now you've begun
to taunt me as well.

756
01:19:06,188 --> 01:19:08,281
Your mother has trained you well.

757
01:19:08,724 --> 01:19:10,248
What else can the bitch do?

758
01:19:22,437 --> 01:19:23,665
Here it is.

759
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:25,061
Connect it.

760
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,136
DVD player...

761
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:31,243
How much did you pay?
- Not much.

762
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,012
Rs. 5000.

763
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:35,682
Karan, if l fail this Test...

764
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:37,616
My father will skin me alive.

765
01:19:37,686 --> 01:19:39,654
Pawan relax. lt's just a Test.

766
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:41,187
You won't fail.

767
01:19:41,557 --> 01:19:43,548
l guarantee that.

768
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:46,352
Now tell me what you
haven't understood.

769
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:46,042
Four Eyes...

770
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:48,356
My drink?

771
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:16,579
This way too?

772
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:21,086
See, it's as simple as that.

773
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:23,424
Even if l solve
these two problems,

774
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:25,389
l'll surely get a passing grade.

775
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:27,154
That's what l was telling you.

776
01:21:30,232 --> 01:21:31,358
Thanks Karan.

777
01:21:33,802 --> 01:21:35,770
l'll leave now.

778
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:37,297
All the best.

779
01:21:37,572 --> 01:21:38,163
Good night.

780
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,138
Good night.

781
01:21:50,752 --> 01:21:51,810
l'll revise.

782
01:22:28,523 --> 01:22:29,785
Sir Please,

783
01:22:32,694 --> 01:22:34,059
l've got a Test tomorrow.

784
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:37,359
We can break the door.

785
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:41,366
One...

786
01:22:43,305 --> 01:22:44,363
Two...

787
01:22:56,418 --> 01:22:57,476
Look at him.

788
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,114
What were you doing?

789
01:23:59,114 --> 01:24:00,479
Who'll you go to now?

790
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,648
Karan?

791
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:05,481
Or the Police?

792
01:24:06,955 --> 01:24:08,183
He won't tell anyone.

793
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:09,422
What'll he say?

794
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,457
That they raped me?

795
01:24:15,764 --> 01:24:17,527
Leave him here, let's go.

796
01:26:00,302 --> 01:26:02,361
'lf anyone troubles
you, let me know'

797
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:04,562
'You'll be able to help me?'

798
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:33,559
Believe me Karan,

799
01:26:34,603 --> 01:26:36,400
lt wasn't your fault.

800
01:26:37,305 --> 01:26:38,738
Stop blaming yourself for it.

801
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:48,376
l'm sure they won't get away.

802
01:26:50,051 --> 01:26:55,216
The Trustees will
take strict action.

803
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:58,016
All of them will be rusticated.

804
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,353
See Mr. Sharma,

805
01:26:59,527 --> 01:27:02,189
We regret whatever happened.

806
01:27:02,397 --> 01:27:03,694
But at the same time,

807
01:27:04,132 --> 01:27:07,397
We can't afford to spoil the
reputation of the university.

808
01:27:08,503 --> 01:27:10,334
Ours is a prestigious institute.

809
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,334
And we have to
maintain its reputation.

810
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:15,399
Media coverage of this incident,...

811
01:27:15,577 --> 01:27:20,173
...will affect admissions
and donations.

812
01:27:20,682 --> 01:27:22,980
l hope you understand Mr. Sharma.

813
01:27:27,322 --> 01:27:30,223
Mr. Saxena, do you understand?
- Yes Sir.

814
01:27:33,595 --> 01:27:45,029
Pawan Mehta was a mentally
challenged student.

815
01:27:53,982 --> 01:28:00,251
He had a mental disorder.

816
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:06,126
We'd often seen him
behaving strangely.

817
01:28:10,398 --> 01:28:13,526
Was this suicide caused by
harassment from other students?

818
01:28:13,601 --> 01:28:17,662
That does not
happen in our Hostel.

819
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:21,040
We are known for our discipline.

820
01:28:21,609 --> 01:28:25,773
As the Dean of the university,
What are your comments?

821
01:28:27,582 --> 01:28:31,541
l think,

822
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:39,090
Mr. Saxena is right.

823
01:28:48,803 --> 01:28:50,668
We suffered a lot too.

824
01:28:52,107 --> 01:28:54,075
But did we hang ourselves?

825
01:28:56,411 --> 01:28:59,073
He was a sissy.

826
01:29:02,117 --> 01:29:04,779
You can't blame Feroz or us.

827
01:29:06,788 --> 01:29:08,779
We haven't murdered him.

828
01:29:11,092 --> 01:29:14,357
He did what he wanted to do.

829
01:29:34,783 --> 01:29:36,114
Anyway,

830
01:29:49,497 --> 01:29:50,395
ls he inside?

831
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:51,227
Yes.

832
01:29:58,406 --> 01:30:00,431
What did you do yesterday?
- Nothing.

833
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:01,473
Hey jerk...

834
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:04,101
Aggrieved over your friend, eh?

835
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:11,510
Don't stare.

836
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:14,645
You can't do anything.

837
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,149
We know that...

838
01:30:19,994 --> 01:30:22,155
...you testified to the Police.

839
01:30:26,734 --> 01:30:28,065
But what happened?

840
01:30:30,371 --> 01:30:35,331
The college management
bribed the cops,

841
01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:37,100
...to keep their mouths shut.

842
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:39,169
And the post mortem report,

843
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:41,547
has been altered too.

844
01:30:45,687 --> 01:30:50,147
Now where'll you go?

845
01:30:53,661 --> 01:30:55,026
To the High Court?

846
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:56,963
To the Supreme Court?

847
01:31:00,301 --> 01:31:03,361
Go to the rooftop, And
scream to the world,

848
01:31:04,305 --> 01:31:06,432
Tell them what we
did to your pal!

849
01:31:07,308 --> 01:31:10,004
Even in Heaven,
they'll laugh at him.

850
01:31:15,483 --> 01:31:16,677
See...

851
01:31:20,288 --> 01:31:24,588
...this is my last
warning to you.

852
01:31:27,395 --> 01:31:33,493
lf you expose us to a
Politician or to the Media,

853
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:41,574
Then, what happened
to your friend,

854
01:31:43,778 --> 01:31:46,747
...could happen...

855
01:31:49,751 --> 01:31:51,150
... to your girlfriend too.

856
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:40,290
Payal,

857
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:46,694
l know it'll be
difficult for you.

858
01:33:49,737 --> 01:33:51,068
But,

859
01:33:51,706 --> 01:33:53,435
Forgive me, if you can.

860
01:33:54,575 --> 01:33:55,667
Forgive you?

861
01:33:57,578 --> 01:34:00,274
But for what?

862
01:34:01,616 --> 01:34:09,079
We're meeting for
the last time today.

863
01:34:20,768 --> 01:34:24,295
After today, there'll
be nothing between us.

864
01:34:27,341 --> 01:34:32,301
Convince yourself
that we never met.

865
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:43,022
Karan, what...

866
01:34:54,068 --> 01:34:56,161
What's wrong Karan?

867
01:35:07,648 --> 01:35:08,615
Karan...

868
01:35:17,558 --> 01:35:19,116
...what did l do?

869
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:24,395
lt's just that you love me.

870
01:35:27,135 --> 01:35:28,329
Don't you love me?

871
01:35:37,111 --> 01:35:39,773
l do. And l always will.

872
01:35:44,652 --> 01:35:47,314
That's why l beg of you...

873
01:35:53,427 --> 01:35:54,485
...forget about me.

874
01:35:58,099 --> 01:36:02,968
Karan, wait!

875
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:50,710
'lf you ever have any
problem, let us know...'

876
01:38:14,635 --> 01:38:17,001
What've you come
to Feroz's room for?

877
01:38:18,005 --> 01:38:19,563
Feroz is not here.

878
01:38:47,068 --> 01:38:47,796
Karan?

879
01:38:53,641 --> 01:38:54,403
Karan?

880
01:39:07,755 --> 01:39:10,053
What's this noise at this hour?

881
01:39:13,227 --> 01:39:14,455
What the hell is this?

882
01:39:14,528 --> 01:39:16,496
Hey! what the hell are you doing?

883
01:39:26,107 --> 01:39:28,405
Don't kill me, don't kill me!!!

884
01:39:28,476 --> 01:39:30,034
Don't shoot, don't shoot!!!

885
01:39:45,226 --> 01:39:46,784
Somebody open the door!!!

886
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:51,155
Karan has gone mad!!!

887
01:39:51,499 --> 01:39:53,626
He'll kill all of us!!!

888
01:39:54,035 --> 01:39:56,265
Open the door!!!

889
01:41:04,772 --> 01:41:06,603
You'd come to kill me, eh?

890
01:42:01,362 --> 01:42:02,727
You'd come to kill me, eh?

891
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:55,546
l'm going to jail anyway.

892
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:58,342
Kill me and you'll be jailed too.

893
01:43:00,988 --> 01:43:02,615
Who says l'm going to kill you?

894
01:43:04,758 --> 01:43:08,319
l'll shoot your hands and legs,

895
01:43:08,562 --> 01:43:10,223
...till you are crippled.

896
01:43:13,467 --> 01:43:15,526
And l'll testify in court,

897
01:43:16,303 --> 01:43:18,533
That l acted in self defence.

898
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,220
Open the door.

899
01:44:49,296 --> 01:44:51,423
Karan has locked the
Hostel from all four sides!

900
01:45:05,379 --> 01:45:06,607
Can you see anything?

901
01:45:06,714 --> 01:45:07,738
No.

902
01:45:47,521 --> 01:45:48,385
No Karan!

903
01:45:48,522 --> 01:45:50,387
Don't do this. Stop it please!

904
01:45:51,258 --> 01:45:55,092
You'll ruin your life son!

905
01:45:55,596 --> 01:45:58,190
You'll ruin your career
son, don't do this!

906
01:45:59,032 --> 01:46:01,592
Throw the rod away...

907
01:46:19,953 --> 01:46:21,284
Good boy.

908
01:46:22,389 --> 01:46:24,357
Step away son, step away...

909
01:46:26,193 --> 01:46:28,354
Come out now son,...

910
01:46:52,286 --> 01:46:53,310
Karan No!
