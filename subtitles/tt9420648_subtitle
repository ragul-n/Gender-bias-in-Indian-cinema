1
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:14,269
I am sitting on top of everyone's head.

2
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:18,851
Big or small, I'm the centre
of attraction in every mirror

3
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:21,553
I am a treat for the eyes.

4
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:26,269
And add likes to your selfies.

5
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:32,258
I am the hero's style
and the heroine's oomph factor.

6
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,141
The secret of your beauty...

7
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,697
...and the permanent crown on your head.

8
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,851
I am treated no less than God.

9
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:47,922
Because we both get oil in offerings

10
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,218
I am 'Hair'!

11
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:53,894
The most important factor...

12
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,060
The skin on your head...
The protector of your brain...

13
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,294
If you have me,
I am a treasure to cherish...

14
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:01,227
...without I am just a lifelong regret.

15
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:08,394
I'm an important contribution
to everyone's life.

16
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:10,060
This is the story of one such character.

17
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:12,851
"Bala."

18
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:17,185
"Bala."

19
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,894
"Bala."

20
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,265
Good morning, sir.

21
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:28,477
Good morning. Sit.

22
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:37,851
Mannerless

23
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:39,727
Hey Baldy

24
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,771
Meet Balmukund Shukla.

25
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,419
Kanpur's Shahrukh Khan (Star)!

26
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:52,363
Bala was simply in
love with his thick hair.

27
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:55,019
Ajju...just blow dry it.

28
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:59,894
Bala, DDLJ style is old news.

29
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,371
K3G style is the new trend now.

30
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:07,772
In big cities small things
keep happening senorita

31
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:13,852
'The little missy's in school
were crazy about this Shahrukh ripoff.'

32
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:17,851
'Except for his friend Latika.'

33
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:21,727
Due to my ugly looks, I was named Kubja.

34
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,771
The world mocked me.

35
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:25,894
No one ever came close to me.

36
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,310
But it isn't my fault...

37
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,977
that the Lord made me ugly.

38
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:36,851
Let me alleviate your pain forever...

39
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,977
Come Kubja, let me make
you beautiful in every aspect.

40
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,810
Hey...

41
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:02,102
Latika. Give me your science book.

42
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,185
I won't.

43
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,477
Don't be such a spoilsport.
Please give no.

44
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:07,727
As I said, no means no.

45
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:46,851
Return my notes.

46
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:47,851
Hi!

47
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:49,394
I said return my notes...

48
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,227
Hey...

49
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,771
...save these hollow threats
for someone else.

50
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,771
Otherwise, when I am done with you...

51
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:59,851
...you'll regret being born. Hey...

52
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:03,044
Move.

53
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:03,642
Wait.

54
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:04,851
Listen, please...

55
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:06,977
- What's this?
- Bala...

56
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:09,727
What is it now?

57
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:10,851
Latika.

58
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:14,766
Next time you want to impress
someone with the notes...

59
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,809
...then focus more on making
your own notes rather than mimicry.

60
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:18,934
Understand.

61
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:23,767
Shruti, please.

62
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:25,600
Shruti. Shruti.

63
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:32,460
What do you think of yourself?

64
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,100
I mean...what's the attitude all about?

65
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:38,309
Whether I talk to another
girl or lend her my notes.

66
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:39,892
Why does it bother you?

67
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,228
Are you out of your mind?

68
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:43,378
I am not interested in idiots like you.

69
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,686
And you have no right to be.

70
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,142
With this black face.

71
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:51,225
All the beautiful girls in school
are crazy about me.

72
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:54,220
And people like you should
be banned from even thinking about me.

73
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,392
Dark Kubja.

74
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:56,934
Not another word from you...

75
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,600
...or else I'll slap you so hard...

76
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:00,642
you'll bounce all the
way to the company garden.

77
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:04,559
I'll say it a hundred times.
You can do whatever you like.

78
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,767
Dark Kubja. Dark Kubja.

79
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,934
Notice the lad's attitude.

80
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,642
It's all because of me

81
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:36,725
But even the ten headed
Ravan's pride was shattered.

82
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:40,600
And this is just one
headed Bala we're speaking of.

83
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,767
"Baldy."

84
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,184
"Baldy."

85
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:01,767
So, at the tender age of 25...

86
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:06,100
...Bala had lost 45% of his hair.

87
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:09,100
I am a rascal...

88
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:14,497
Doesn't take me long
to turn a star into extra.

89
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,392
"Your brother's abuses..."

90
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,517
"...and your standing ovations..."

91
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:21,892
"And every time I went
flat broke in your love.."

92
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:23,686
"I will never forget..."

93
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:24,513
"As long as I'm alive...

94
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:25,686
"As long as I'm alive..."

95
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:26,892
"As long as I'm alive..."

96
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,142
"Dumping me like yesterday's newspaper."

97
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,225
"And ignoring me whenever I am around."

98
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:33,100
"I will never forget..."

99
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,975
"I will never forget..."

100
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:42,642
Very good. Very good.

101
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,687
When I make an exit from your life,
I don't exit alone.

102
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:57,600
I take your happiness, your smile,

103
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:00,767
and even your 13-year-old
steady girlfriend.

104
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:04,559
- You are so sweet.
- Dumps you without a notice.

105
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:12,767
I had already warned you...

106
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:14,642
...that she is not trustworthy.

107
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:16,766
Let's drop this topic.

108
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,686
I've said so many times,
I've diabetes, go easy on the butter.

109
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,401
It won't hurt, son. Eat it.

110
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:23,809
Aim at your mother.

111
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,353
Vihaan, do you want a beating.

112
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,184
- You two have breakfast as well.
- Fine... Harder.

113
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,767
I guess they'll have
breakfast at lunch break.

114
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:33,184
Yes brother, you eat because of for your
heartbreak, and we'll have at lunch break.

115
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,313
Everyone in this house is a comedian.

116
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,559
See, grandpa...

117
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:39,642
...he's growing brazen by the day.

118
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:42,559
Don't get mad at him.

119
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:49,515
I wish you had focused on
off break instead of heartbreak...

120
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,547
...then you would
be playing for Ranji like me...

121
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:52,934
Go on... Go on...

122
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,934
Compare his heartbreak with cricket.

123
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,517
Some mango seeds.

124
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,600
God bless you.

125
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:11,017
What? Is there an LCD screen
on my head that you are staring at it?

126
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,225
It's nothing...

127
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:14,100
I was just wondering.

128
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:15,642
Wondering what?

129
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:18,100
Why did Shruti break up with you?

130
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:20,142
You want a beating.

131
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:21,686
Perfect catch.

132
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,017
Why are you digging his wounds?

133
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,767
Bala, you should forget Shruti.

134
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:27,767
Soon you will find an angel.

135
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,642
Stop carrying this makeup everywhere.

136
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:38,686
There's no future in
selling beauty products, son.

137
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:41,225
You are an artist,
so follow your passion. Understand.

138
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,642
You followed your passion, didn't you?

139
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:44,729
But where did that get you?

140
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:48,725
How many people in Kanpur
have played for Ranji.

141
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:50,686
I followed my passion
and that got me somewhere.

142
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,309
Don't I want my son
to be successful as well.

143
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:53,600
I am still trying.

144
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:56,434
When I make a name for myself in comedy,
I'll quit this job.

145
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:00,975
"Baldy."

146
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:03,600
"Baldy."

147
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:05,766
"Baldy."

148
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,225
"Baldy."

149
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,934
"Set out like an emperor..."

150
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:22,392
"Watch him go..."

151
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:26,934
"He thinks no one's better than him..."

152
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:29,392
"He's non stop."

153
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:31,729
- "He's on the top."
- Hold this bag.

154
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:36,600
"He lives in a classical world
where he's hip-hop."

155
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,767
- "With his head held high..."
- Where to?

156
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:41,184
- "He walks with pride."
- This is important, I'll be back soon.

157
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:46,017
"Because he believes
he's the star of Kanpur."

158
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,434
Bala, how are you?

159
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:51,392
"Rupan, the more cola you drink...

160
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:52,975
...sooner you'll explode.

161
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,809
Don't forget."

162
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,392
Don't cross your limits.

163
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:57,892
Just one more time Rajesh Khanna, please.

164
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,975
Nothing in this world comes
for free, aunty.

165
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:04,511
How many women are you sending from your
neighborhood for attending the seminar?

166
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,225
I love it.

167
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,100
You know what...

168
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:10,142
First, help me out with Insta...

169
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:12,687
...and then I'll do your job.

170
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,017
You never skip an
opportunity to blackmail me.

171
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:17,975
Here you go.

172
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:19,100
Show me.

173
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:22,100
Little more... Just a little more...

174
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,184
- She will be hardly recognizable.
- Come on...

175
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,892
I have a question...

176
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:30,434
What is this seminar
you conduct for all the girls?

177
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:35,225
I have the perfect solution
for girls who can't get married.

178
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,142
What has Latika done to you?

179
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,434
Why don't you invite her?

180
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:39,255
I've never said no.

181
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:40,725
- Then?
- Bring her over.

182
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:42,138
But don't tell her that I invited her.

183
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,311
Yes, aunty.

184
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:46,309
What was so urgent?

185
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:49,215
Actually,
I am coming down to your court...

186
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,766
...and we've to attend
a seminar together.

187
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:53,225
What seminar?

188
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,809
Bala's invited us.

189
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:57,809
And especially you.

190
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:01,766
Look here, aunty,
I am not coming to any stupid seminar.

191
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:04,686
I know you're a lawyer,
but I am the judge in this family.

192
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,017
I am coming down there.
And now I am hanging up.

193
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:06,766
Hello...

194
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:08,642
...aunty?

195
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,892
You must be wondering why I called you
all down here in the middle of the day.

196
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,766
So let me start with my presentation.

197
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:22,686
These are some matrimonial
ads from the leading newspapers.

198
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,809
Meaning Marriage column.

199
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:29,142
That one factor everyone's
stressed on...is fairness.

200
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:31,809
Education,
caste, creed, etcetera all come later.

201
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:33,392
Just one demand.

202
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:35,934
Fair girl wanted.

203
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,725
Fair girl wanted.

204
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:42,184
Probably you missed these
matrimonial due to some reason.

205
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:44,473
But you must have heard these songs.

206
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,892
Bhajan Samrat Anup Jalota said...

207
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:51,393
"Says to Mother Yashoda, Nandlala..."

208
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:54,225
"...why is Radha so fair,
and me so dark?"

209
00:13:54,377 --> 00:13:55,729
Kumar Sanu said...

210
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,686
"O fair one...don't steal my heart."

211
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:00,934
"O fair one..."

212
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:02,766
Udit Narayan...

213
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:06,559
"Black glasses on the fair face."

214
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:07,642
In short...

215
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:10,225
Who is fair is beautiful.

216
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:11,766
I am not saying this

217
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,309
It's the ideology of society.

218
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:15,309
A tradition that's being
followed since the onset of time.

219
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:17,642
And no matter what you do
we cannot change this ideology.

220
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,411
Don't be disheartened, my friends...

221
00:14:21,623 --> 00:14:25,411
You can't change this ideology, but
you can change the colour of your skin.

222
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,686
Presenting Pretty You...

223
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,809
5 weeks...

224
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,729
Yes, in only 5 weeks
it will make you fair...

225
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:32,767
Pretty You...

226
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:34,479
Filled with herbal chemicals...

227
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,309
...for that fairness inside you.

228
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,892
Excuse me.

229
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:43,600
Excuse me.

230
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:46,184
I had a question.

231
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:48,225
- Can I come over there?
- No, you can ask from right there.

232
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:50,642
- I'll come there.
- You can ask from your seat...

233
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,600
- Move.
- Save your questions for the...

234
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,100
Why do you have that cap on your head?

235
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,809
We are in a closed room.

236
00:14:57,225 --> 00:14:58,541
Is it too sunny for you?

237
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:00,142
My cap, my choice.

238
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,766
Take it off.

239
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,934
No one else seems to be bothered,
except for you.

240
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:05,766
- Take it off.
- I won't.

241
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:09,431
Don't be shy.

242
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:10,725
Take it off.

243
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,142
What's wrong Balmukund?

244
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:20,809
Didn't your company make
a product for this baldness...

245
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:24,642
Filled with herbal chemicals...

246
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:28,725
Please, continue.

247
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,517
Leave.

248
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:32,225
I said leave.

249
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:37,975
So where was I?

250
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:40,017
Let me introduce you to my products.

251
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:40,809
Here's...

252
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,934
This is our beauty bar.

253
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:47,766
No, this is virgin coconut oil

254
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:51,767
Apply it on your hair before you sleep.

255
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:54,892
This is our beauty bar.

256
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,766
You can buy it at a discount of 15%

257
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,600
Let's make it 20.

258
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,559
In fact, buy one get one free.

259
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,642
Total waste.

260
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:09,767
Mr. Shukla.

261
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,100
Why are you hiding back there?

262
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,767
Show your face.

263
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:18,642
You're looking pretty dapper today.

264
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:21,642
Why did you spoil the seminar yesterday?

265
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:23,184
Things went a little awry.

266
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:25,309
But I'll cover it up
in the next seminar.

267
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,434
You claimed to have
a fire when you joined us.

268
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:30,392
What happened to it now?

269
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:34,309
Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

270
00:16:34,642 --> 00:16:35,934
Until you don't...

271
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:38,809
...sit with Mr. Bharadwaj
and take care of the inventory.

272
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,687
- Mr. Bharadwaj...
- Yes, sir...

273
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,501
I am sending a partner for you.
Now you won't feel lonely anymore.

274
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:44,766
Thank you, sir.

275
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,687
But sir, I'm in marketing.

276
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,975
I need presentable boys for marketing.

277
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:52,371
Young and energetic.

278
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:53,833
But I am young... what else am I?

279
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,412
Varun, come.

280
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:58,578
Now that's young.

281
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,204
We're the same age.

282
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,499
Handover your rocket to him.

283
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:02,912
Now he's going to fly it.

284
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:04,329
- Varun.
- Yes, sir.

285
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:05,499
Understand all the areas properly...

286
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,371
- ...and go in all guns blazing.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:20,621
What is this?

288
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,829
What is this?

289
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:23,957
- What is this?
- Listen to me, sweetheart.

290
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:25,246
There's nothing to hear.

291
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,454
I'll slap you so hard
you won't know what hit you.

292
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:28,954
- Where's the blade?
- Not the blade... Not the blade...

293
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:30,499
- You'll hurt someone.
- Bala, what's going on?

294
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:31,454
Jaggi...

295
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:34,371
Before I cut you down to size, get out.

296
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,498
Customer is God, Bala. Jaggi...

297
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:37,787
Enough of your crap.

298
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:41,195
You were being such a smartass and said that
putting oil for 15 days will stop my hair fall.

299
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,413
I did... I did...but listen to me...

300
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:44,677
I'm losing more hair now.

301
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,927
Everyone in office calls me old man.

302
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:49,219
Fooling your own friend.
Aren't you ashamed?

303
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:51,596
You're an embarrassment
to our friendship...

304
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:53,635
You're turning bald!

305
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:55,676
What do you expect me to do?

306
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:14,676
I am a barber.

307
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,219
I cut hair, not grow them.

308
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:20,302
But hair is your expertise, isn't it?
That is why I am asking you...

309
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:23,844
Don't be sad.

310
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:25,927
There is one way.

311
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:29,927
See.

312
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:31,677
This is a Thekla.

313
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,302
Toupe in English.

314
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:37,135
Just stick it wherever
you don't have hair.

315
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:39,302
- I don't need this Thekla.
- Why?

316
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,427
Masturbation and sex
are two different things.

317
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,677
This is masturbation.
I want the real deal.

318
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:45,677
I want to grow...real hair.

319
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:47,635
How is that possible, brother?

320
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,414
This land is completely barren.

321
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:51,635
Are you stupid?

322
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:53,802
I know the problem, give me a solution.

323
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:58,344
Your solution is right before you...

324
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:00,635
...and you're looking elsewhere.

325
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:03,885
Brother Bachchan...

326
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,676
Who's this scrawny guy?

327
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:10,927
He's my sidekick.

328
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:13,676
But I want to be yours.

329
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,844
Give me a sure-shot solution.

330
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:17,052
Well...

331
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:20,927
let's look at the problem area first.

332
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,010
Someone might see me...

333
00:19:24,302 --> 00:19:25,677
Unbelievable ...

334
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:26,674
Wait.

335
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:28,927
The things I've to do.

336
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:33,052
What the bloody...

337
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:36,596
You were called Bala because
of your silky hair, weren't you?

338
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,635
Yes, brother.

339
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,510
But now look at it.

340
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:45,302
Don't be disappointed.

341
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:49,135
Look, son, you're not the
first guy in the world who is bald.

342
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:50,676
The world's full of it.

343
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:52,719
In fact, even Rajnikant sir is bald.

344
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:54,596
Even though he's like...

345
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,719
I was a star in school... A star...

346
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:58,677
I've lived like a star.

347
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,676
I am not used to be an extra.
I can't live like this.

348
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:02,927
Now you tell me...

349
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:05,469
How can a star live like an extra?

350
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,135
You can't imagine my pain.

351
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:12,596
I can't focus on my job...

352
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:14,344
Selfies make me self-pity

353
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:15,844
My childhood girlfriend dumped me...

354
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:16,885
for an idiot.

355
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:20,094
The guy looks like me,
except for one difference...

356
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:21,802
Silky wavy hair...

357
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:23,676
...which I don't have.

358
00:20:24,552 --> 00:20:26,635
I am not just losing hair,
but also my identity.

359
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,676
I must admit...

360
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:32,094
I must admit, son...

361
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,885
You've taken the pain
of baldness to the next level.

362
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:40,427
I am losing hair...

363
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:42,635
Please save me, brother.

364
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:43,927
It's a difficult task.

365
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:48,510
But I'll do it.

366
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:58,344
And thus began the struggle to make
this impossible mission possible.

367
00:20:58,469 --> 00:20:59,677
Why are you standing on your head, son?

368
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:01,639
This ensures better blood
supply to the hair roots.

369
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,676
The infallible solution to falling hair.

370
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:04,802
Keep trying.

371
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:11,677
"It shall rain again..."

372
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:15,676
"...and you shall be blessed
With lushness."

373
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:24,844
Stop staring at the puppy dog.

374
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:26,676
Here's an idea...

375
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:30,094
Mix castor oil, olive oil,
coconut oil, jute seed oil...

376
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:32,927
Who wants these?

377
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:33,844
I don't know.

378
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:35,052
Mother asked me to bring these.

379
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:36,676
Your mother's losing hair too.

380
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:38,510
It must be hereditary.

381
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,677
Put it all in a bag.

382
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:44,802
Aunty, there must be
several songs on the moon.

383
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:47,219
"My heart's like the moon."

384
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,344
"The moon's out tonight..."

385
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:50,927
"Shining like the full moon..."

386
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:53,844
And "shine brightly
over the horizon, O moon."

387
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:57,676
Balmukund...

388
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,927
You're forgetting your stuff...

389
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,427
I don't want it.

390
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,927
But what about the patch on your head.

391
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:08,719
First, you should go take
a look at yourself in the mirror.

392
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,194
The day you do that...

393
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,052
...you will stop looking in the mirror.

394
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:16,177
That reminds me...

395
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:18,469
I met Shruti, from school.

396
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,676
Your ex-girlfriend.

397
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:24,552
She was telling me that
she dumped you.

398
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:28,344
Why did she dump you?

399
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,344
Vihaan...

400
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:36,177
- Apply this on your brother's head.
- Oh, mom...

401
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Vihaan.

402
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:39,760
Slow down, will you...
I already have a bald patch.

403
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,427
Don't worry.

404
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:09,676
"These silky tresses."

405
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:13,760
"These mesmerizing eyes..."

406
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:20,676
"Gives me a reason to live."

407
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:23,927
"These silky tresses."

408
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:28,427
Here you go.

409
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:31,260
I will not commit this blasphemy
for the sake of your hair.

410
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:34,385
Never in this lifetime.
Eggs in my house, never.

411
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:37,052
This is my house, not yours.

412
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,760
Don't forget you're
a live-in son-in-law.

413
00:23:40,444 --> 00:23:42,024
You moved in claiming you'll
stay only for three months,...

414
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:43,824
...but you've been here for 30-years now.

415
00:23:44,052 --> 00:23:45,552
Stop it, papa.

416
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:49,177
Vihaan...give your brother a hand.

417
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,760
Careful while applying it.

418
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:52,676
Don't let a single
drop fall on the ground.

419
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,427
"It shall rain on you again."

420
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:59,802
"And you'll be blessed with lushness."

421
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:04,135
"It shall rain on you again."

422
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:07,760
"Bala..."

423
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:11,302
I'm about to tell you the biggest
sorrow of a young man.

424
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:12,596
Baldness.

425
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:13,844
I was bald.

426
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,427
Girls would ignore me.

427
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:19,596
"Then I found this
amazing thermal cap."

428
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:22,639
"This gives warmth to my hair roots."

429
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,676
Bala, your tea's right here...

430
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:27,177
Nerds.

431
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,010
"It shall rain on you again."

432
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:38,552
Wow...

433
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:42,676
I owned this race and I always win 'Cause
I am the oldest player of this race.

434
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:43,844
Wow...

435
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:46,177
She always said the
revolution will come...

436
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,760
Will they bring revolution?

437
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:49,676
Alone in the race...

438
00:24:57,469 --> 00:25:00,177
I called my school teacher baldy...

439
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:02,676
Teased him.

440
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,597
I drew his picture on the board.

441
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:07,676
And now I'm being punished
for mocking a teacher.

442
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:12,177
Whenever I look at myself in the mirror
I can hear "Baldy" ringing my ears.

443
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:15,676
You think too much.

444
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:18,676
Stop thinking about your hair.

445
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:21,260
This is exactly why
you're losing hair.

446
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:23,676
This...

447
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:29,597
- "After Holi..."
- Don't think, don't think about it at all

448
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:33,052
"...will come Diwali."

449
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:41,510
"It shall rain on you again."

450
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,344
"Bala."

451
00:25:47,424 --> 00:25:49,635
I see you when I close my eyes.

452
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:54,260
I want to see you when I open my eyes.

453
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,302
My eyes...

454
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,552
...look for my love

455
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:03,597
Call it love, madness, or

456
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,094
Son Bala...

457
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:12,260
I heard Rubbing onion on the
head helps grow new hair.

458
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:16,597
Vihaan...give your brother a hand.

459
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:17,885
Oh, God.

460
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:19,885
Did you wash your hands?

461
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:23,552
Look...we found someone
for you on the matrimony site.

462
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:26,135
She's as fair as an angel, see

463
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,719
I don't want to get married.

464
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,135
Listen...

465
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,802
I am talking
from personal experience.

466
00:26:30,885 --> 00:26:34,289
You should walk down
the aisle while you still can.

467
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:36,597
Otherwise,
you don't have a chance later.

468
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:38,676
- There's a bigger patch on this side.
- Get lost.

469
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:44,676
How are you going to fill this football
field with a couple of hair strands?

470
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:46,635
I need a temporary fix...

471
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:48,260
...so I can meet with the girl.

472
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:50,135
I'll give your hair a makeover...

473
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:51,596
...that no one's going
to notice this patch.

474
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:52,302
Just watch...

475
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:54,844
I don't want a makeover,
I want an entire lush up here.

476
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,844
You underestimate me.

477
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:03,596
What is this?

478
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:04,885
Close your eyes...

479
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:06,676
and witness the magic.

480
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:12,094
"It will rain on you again."

481
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:15,219
"Bala."

482
00:27:28,094 --> 00:27:30,427
Bala...why don't you
have a word with her?

483
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:36,135
I've heard you're
into mimicry as well.

484
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:38,635
Let's hear something then.

485
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:41,676
Well, who would you prefer?

486
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:44,219
Dev sir...or...

487
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:45,677
...Shahrukh Khan.

488
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:49,676
Actually, I like Ranbir Kapoor more.

489
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:52,677
I never tried before,
but can give it a shot.

490
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:56,427
Hello, this is Ranbir Kapoor.

491
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,927
You're the best.

492
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:00,844
Will you marry me?

493
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:14,344
Mummy...

494
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:22,219
What else do you expect
when you try Ajju's amateur ideas?

495
00:28:23,677 --> 00:28:24,676
Listen...

496
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:27,676
I have the perfect solution for you.

497
00:28:28,094 --> 00:28:32,469
Make a mixture of buffalo dung
and bull's semen and put it on your head.

498
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:35,219
You'll have long wavy hair.

499
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:38,676
Here you go, mister.

500
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,635
And this will be 1500 extra.

501
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,344
Vihaan...give your brother a hand.

502
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:56,344
All I ever do is give him a hand.

503
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,596
I've other things to do.
I can't do this anymore.

504
00:28:58,676 --> 00:28:59,596
Why not?

505
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:02,885
Stop exploiting me, brother.
I beg you.

506
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,344
Even inmates at jail
don't get tortured so much...

507
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:07,844
...as much as you guys torture me.

508
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:09,469
Every morning after I get up...

509
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:13,052
...I'm stressed wondering what dirty
thing will I have to touch today.

510
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,639
Now I'll give you a beating too.

511
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,676
I don't care.

512
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:18,802
I am not scared of anyone.

513
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:21,596
I didn't pluck out your hair.

514
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,844
You turned bald on your own.

515
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:26,596
Your head, your problem...

516
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:28,135
...then deal with it yourself.

517
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,552
I don't want any part of it.

518
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:32,318
I am leaving.
Do what you want to yourself

519
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:33,885
I am not going to help. Get lost.

520
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:53,676
"It will rain on you again."

521
00:29:56,552 --> 00:30:00,052
"And you'll be blessed
with lushness again."

522
00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:03,510
"It will rain on you again."

523
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:29,510
Hair transplant.

524
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:33,010
In a Hair transplant, we take
hair from other parts of your body...

525
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:37,676
...and plant it one by one on the
part where you don't have any hair.

526
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,344
You want this, don't you?

527
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:42,469
- Yes.
- You want new hair, don't you?

528
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:43,344
Yes...

529
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,639
The area from where we collect
the hair is called the donor area.

530
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,676
What is it called?

531
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:50,676
- Donor area.
- Right. Correct...

532
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:57,676
Mostly we collect hair from the back
of your head, your beard, chest, arm...

533
00:30:58,135 --> 00:31:00,596
But you don't have enough
hair in these regions.

534
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:03,344
And whatever hair you have,
are pretty weak.

535
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,635
So?

536
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,885
There are two more donor areas.

537
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:11,302
One is armpit

538
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:12,719
He means under the arms, brother.

539
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,596
He's right.

540
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:16,676
And the other one...

541
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,676
Down there...

542
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,219
- What?
- Yes...

543
00:31:29,302 --> 00:31:30,596
It will be very painful.

544
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:31,885
I know it will be painful...

545
00:31:32,052 --> 00:31:35,844
...but the pubic hair is
always a couple of years younger.

546
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:37,597
Have you lost your mind?

547
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:39,596
I won't put pubic hair on my head.

548
00:31:39,676 --> 00:31:41,260
Sit down.

549
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:42,802
Try to understand.

550
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:45,639
So what if its pubic hair,
it's still your hair.

551
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:48,597
Even shit we poop is also ours,
but we don't eat it.

552
00:31:48,677 --> 00:31:49,802
Correct.

553
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,260
It will be a little curly,
but they will look nice.

554
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,844
Yaa curly hair is the latest trend.

555
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:59,597
This man's telling me
to put pubic hair on my head.

556
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,219
I am never going to do it.

557
00:32:01,302 --> 00:32:02,427
But...

558
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:04,676
Under the belt in the first meeting?

559
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,844
Bala...

560
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,635
you must go to Lucknow for 2 months,
as a replacement.

561
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,844
Mr. Saxena from marketing is retiring.

562
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,677
Send someone more presentable.

563
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:22,302
Young and energetic.

564
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,552
Taunting your boss

565
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,596
Why won't you go?

566
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:28,302
Mom has a transplant...

567
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:29,719
...it's her knee.

568
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,676
And anyway, I still have a lot
of inventory work pending.

569
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:34,635
You're a pain in the neck.

570
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,676
I am...

571
00:32:36,844 --> 00:32:38,427
A big pain in the neck.

572
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,802
"I am young even at 60..."

573
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,676
"...finally got engaged."

574
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,805
"No one to worry about in my family..."

575
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:57,094
"...Mom, uncle, or aunty."

576
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,676
"Youth jumped out the window..."

577
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:03,430
"...as old age knocked on the doors."

578
00:33:03,676 --> 00:33:09,635
"I want to set those doors
and windows on fire..."

579
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:13,052
I am ready.

580
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,344
What for?

581
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,302
That thing you said.

582
00:33:18,885 --> 00:33:19,677
What?

583
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:22,927
Using pubic hair on my head.

584
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:25,260
But won't it be painful for you?

585
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:26,596
He'll endure the pain.

586
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:27,927
The hair can be curly...

587
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:29,635
I'll straighten them.

588
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,552
Doctor, I am ready
to do anything it takes...

589
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:35,427
...just give me new hair.
I don't want to wear a wig.

590
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:38,802
Don't make me emotional.
I'll think of something.

591
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,677
Here... fill this form.

592
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,885
What was your name?

593
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:45,676
Bal Mukund Shukla.

594
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,427
Bal...seriously?

595
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,219
Write it down.

596
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,927
Where's the doctor?
Where's the doctor?

597
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:52,885
- What's the matter?
- Call the doctor out here.

598
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:55,802
- What's the matter?
- I've been robbed.

599
00:33:55,885 --> 00:33:58,344
- I'll kill you. Let me go.
- Calm down. Calm down.

600
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,052
What's all the commotion?
What happened?

601
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:01,469
- What happened?
- Look at this...

602
00:34:01,552 --> 00:34:03,260
Its bleeding, the wound's infected.

603
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:05,927
- Do you understand?
- See what he's done to me.

604
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:08,260
Don't believe him, he's a fraud.

605
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:11,052
Don't worry...there is one in
a million chance of this happening.

606
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:12,260
Allergies like this...

607
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,885
Diabetes patients are at higher risk.

608
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,596
You don't have diabetes, do you?
Fill up the form.

609
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:17,427
And you come with me.

610
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,260
What is this?

611
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,677
What is it? What... What...?

612
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:34,676
You should play that on the front foot.
It's coming full toss.

613
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:36,719
Come on...

614
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:39,052
Come on...

615
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,260
- I am not out yet...
- Give me the bat.

616
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:43,427
- I am not out yet, papa...
- Throw the ball.

617
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,596
- Fine, fine...
- Throw the ball.

618
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:45,635
Come on.

619
00:34:46,302 --> 00:34:47,344
Throw one ball.

620
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,427
Throw him a good one.

621
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,344
- Out!
- Out!

622
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,135
- Out.
- You're out.

623
00:34:57,635 --> 00:35:00,052
- The ball didn't connect with the bat.
- I took a catch.

624
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:01,596
You're out.

625
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:02,596
But the bat...

626
00:35:02,676 --> 00:35:04,260
I'll hit you with this bat.

627
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:06,052
I'll swing this bat at you...

628
00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:07,469
Take the bat.

629
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,596
I'll break your balls.

630
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:11,469
I'll show you.

631
00:35:11,552 --> 00:35:13,597
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

632
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:16,427
You think you'll hit me.

633
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,639
Why are you interfering?
This is not the IPL.

634
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,427
We're playing cricket and you're
turning this into a wrestling match.

635
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,596
Come here...

636
00:35:22,676 --> 00:35:24,135
Better explain your friend...

637
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:26,427
I'll kill him.

638
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:27,677
Tell him...

639
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:29,596
Come inside.

640
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:31,344
Have you lost your mind?
Have you gone berserk?

641
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,302
Yes, I've gone berserk.

642
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,635
I've lost my mind.

643
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:35,510
Get lost, this is personal.

644
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:37,229
Don't get angry at him.
This is not his fault.

645
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,469
It's your fault.

646
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:39,885
This is all your doing.

647
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:42,349
If you don't defend
the ball you will get out.

648
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:44,439
Not the ball,
I am talking about my hair.

649
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,719
What about your hair
What is this?

650
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:48,635
This...

651
00:35:48,802 --> 00:35:49,802
This bald patch...

652
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,094
This is your doing.

653
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,676
You've bad genes.

654
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,844
My genes are bad.

655
00:35:55,135 --> 00:35:55,844
Look at mom...

656
00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:57,219
she's got amazing hair.

657
00:35:57,299 --> 00:35:59,377
Look at grandpa,
he's still got hair at this age.

658
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,885
He had hair until 5 years ago.

659
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:02,676
And look at me...

660
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:05,302
You gave this bald hair,
plus diabetes.

661
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:11,635
My hands shiver while
uploading pics on social media.

662
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:13,885
I get demoted at the job...
Flop in mimicry...

663
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:15,597
My childhood girlfriend dumps me.

664
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,597
Talking to a beautiful
girl scares the shit out of me.

665
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:19,885
Imagining that she will laugh at me.

666
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:24,510
I get proposals from weird girls.

667
00:36:24,677 --> 00:36:26,510
And when I do get a decent proposal...

668
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:28,676
...she runs away screaming like
she's seen a ghost.

669
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:32,676
Even dog's make me envy.

670
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:36,510
I wear a cap before
wearing my underwear...

671
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,676
..because without it,
I feel naked.

672
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:44,676
At least you have a beard,
whereas I don't even get that.

673
00:36:46,177 --> 00:36:48,427
My life's ruined because of you.

674
00:36:48,844 --> 00:36:50,676
You won't talk to me like that.

675
00:36:51,129 --> 00:36:52,596
I am your father. Understand.

676
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:54,302
Even Hrithik has a father,
and he's bald.

677
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:55,844
But he took care of his son's hair.

678
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:57,135
He's got such amazing hair...

679
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,676
...even his six fingers fall short
to brush through them.

680
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,469
Did you take care of your son?

681
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,596
Forget about me...

682
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:03,802
What did you achieve
in your life, papa?

683
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:07,305
Don't talk to me like that,
I am a Ranji player, son.

684
00:37:07,545 --> 00:37:09,676
Go on... Go on... I am listening...

685
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:12,676
You played only one match
and got retired hurt for three runs!

686
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:14,302
Ranji...

687
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:33,219
You must be really happy today?

688
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:41,052
"As the saying goes,
keep trying till you succeed."

689
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,927
"Says who."

690
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:46,596
"Even after trying 210 methods..."

691
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:50,552
"...in the last two years..."

692
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:53,219
"Bala has finally given up."

693
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,469
Uppeji, get a glass of water.

694
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:03,427
Why are you shedding tears?

695
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,344
What else do you expect
when I've piled on so much weight?

696
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:08,219
- What...
- It's all my fault.

697
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:10,260
I've turned into a big fat cow.

698
00:38:11,676 --> 00:38:13,927
I've put on 30 kilos, sister.

699
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,927
Every woman gains weight post-delivery.

700
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:19,135
That's natural.

701
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,802
That doesn't give your husband licence
to flirt around with other women.

702
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,802
Take my advice and divorce him.

703
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:26,719
No, sister...

704
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:28,676
why will I divorce him?

705
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:30,676
He's my true love.

706
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:33,596
Your true love's out
directing another love story...

707
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,676
...and you are justifying his perverse
with your overweight.

708
00:38:38,003 --> 00:38:38,639
This is wrong.

709
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,219
Isn't self respect important as well.

710
00:38:41,676 --> 00:38:42,802
And what is this?

711
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:45,353
I am fat, I've piled on weight...

712
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:46,469
Look at her...

713
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,885
Look at aunty.

714
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,719
She turned 54...

715
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:52,638
...but her confidence never wavered.

716
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:54,677
We've to be like her, Kusum.

717
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:57,469
Strong and confident.

718
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,260
Now leave...

719
00:39:00,802 --> 00:39:01,927
Darling...

720
00:39:02,094 --> 00:39:03,677
Give that to me...

721
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,552
Look...no need to divorce him.

722
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:08,344
He dumped you for your weight...

723
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,927
...and I got dumped for my moustache.

724
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:11,885
Take my advice and try dieting.

725
00:39:12,094 --> 00:39:15,094
I read in a magazine recently,
about the new keto...

726
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:17,597
- ...and its really effective.
- Kusum, now go.

727
00:39:17,677 --> 00:39:19,094
- Diet?...
- No. Please...

728
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:20,802
And call me later.

729
00:39:21,314 --> 00:39:22,302
Come here.

730
00:39:22,382 --> 00:39:24,427
Why are you giving such
stupid advice to my client?

731
00:39:24,507 --> 00:39:25,597
Looks bad.

732
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:29,344
Okay, fine. Let's drop this topic.
Now fix your mood.

733
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,596
We're going to meet a guy...

734
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:34,260
Aunty, stop giving
so much importance to guys.

735
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:36,596
Why?
He's a working guy...

736
00:39:36,676 --> 00:39:38,010
Has a job in Australia.

737
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,180
Because of your marriage at
least I'll get to see kangaroos once.

738
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,677
And you want me to marry
another kangaroo for that.

739
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:50,597
"Body like silver,
and hair like gold."

740
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:54,676
"You're the fortunate one..."

741
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:56,596
It's really hot this time.

742
00:39:56,676 --> 00:40:00,052
You must be used to colder weather...
among the kangaroos.

743
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:03,719
"You're the fortunate one, among all."

744
00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:06,802
"The rest are paupers."

745
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:11,676
"Body like silver,
and hair like gold."

746
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:14,844
- She is dark - What are you saying?
- "You're the only fortunate one..."

747
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:16,510
It's so hot...

748
00:40:16,676 --> 00:40:18,219
...that everyone's getting a tan.

749
00:40:18,302 --> 00:40:20,552
Look at him...
Even he's got tanned.

750
00:40:20,677 --> 00:40:21,676
Stop it!

751
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:24,676
"Body like silver..."

752
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,427
It was really nice meeting you.

753
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,260
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

754
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,094
Bala.

755
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:43,802
There are free samples in
the inventory. Give that to Varun.

756
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:44,676
Okay, sir.

757
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:46,552
We're sending Varun to Lucknow.

758
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:48,676
Because you have a transplant
coming up, don't you?

759
00:40:48,885 --> 00:40:50,676
Actually, it's my mom
who's getting a transplant.

760
00:40:51,094 --> 00:40:53,469
You find enough time for mimicry...

761
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:55,344
...and save all the excuses for the job.

762
00:40:55,677 --> 00:40:56,676
Huh...

763
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:58,344
Give the free samples to Varun.

764
00:40:58,469 --> 00:40:59,219
Yes, sir.

765
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:01,510
Give the payment to Pari's mother
as soon as the shoot's over.

766
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:03,052
Otherwise, she won't stop calling.

767
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:04,676
Pari who?

768
00:41:04,802 --> 00:41:07,676
It's our model of course.
Pari Mishra.

769
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,596
Is it Pari's ad shoot?

770
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,676
Yes, Pari's ad-shoot.

771
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,719
She has become a sensation on tiktok

772
00:41:15,177 --> 00:41:17,510
The company wants to make
a new fairness cream ad.

773
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:19,719
And they want only her.
Tik-Tok girl.

774
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:24,844
"Oh my sweetheart."

775
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,927
"Take me to a place..."

776
00:41:29,802 --> 00:41:32,094
"Oh my sweetheart."

777
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:38,510
What are you drinking?

778
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:40,927
Cold drink.

779
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:42,677
Give me some...

780
00:41:44,677 --> 00:41:46,052
You're not supposed to...

781
00:41:46,676 --> 00:41:49,219
You must have mixed it with
sugar deflecting solution.

782
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:50,676
Give it here

783
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:01,885
Good one.

784
00:42:02,677 --> 00:42:03,676
Good one.

785
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:10,639
What is this?

786
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:13,094
Especially for you
all the way from Delhi.

787
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:14,094
For me?

788
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,676
It's a gift.

789
00:42:16,094 --> 00:42:17,302
Why get a gift for me?

790
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,885
Must be an occasion.

791
00:42:20,094 --> 00:42:21,844
First, open your gift.

792
00:42:27,302 --> 00:42:28,676
What the...

793
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:42,010
It's your happy hair day.

794
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:47,052
Your father's gifting you hair, son.

795
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:49,927
I know...

796
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:52,135
you want real hair.

797
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,094
But in real life
reality is just fiction.

798
00:42:57,344 --> 00:42:58,927
I admit...

799
00:42:59,552 --> 00:43:01,885
maybe not like Hritik...

800
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:04,344
...but this is hair after all.

801
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,676
Go out for a few days.

802
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,469
People will believe...

803
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,676
They will think that
you got yourself treated.

804
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,094
Papa...

805
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:23,010
Sorry!

806
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:26,052
It's all right.

807
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,844
"...I made a comeback in Bala's life."

808
00:43:37,552 --> 00:43:41,094
As an opportunity.

809
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,135
To make him a star again.

810
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:48,052
To get his imagination out of Tik-Tok...

811
00:43:48,635 --> 00:43:52,635
...and to make it real.

812
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:07,427
Why do you look sad?

813
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,010
Did you have an argument
with the boss over allowance?

814
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:14,885
Allowance hardly matters.

815
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:16,927
I don't want to go to Lucknow.

816
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,052
I just managed to score with a girl.

817
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:21,219
If I lose out on her now,
I'll have to start all over again.

818
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:22,676
True...

819
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:26,094
Dude, scoring with a girl
in Kanpur is mission impossible.

820
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:27,010
Tell me about it.

821
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:28,135
Look at me...

822
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:30,427
My childhood girlfriend dumped me.

823
00:44:30,676 --> 00:44:32,052
And I've been trying since then.

824
00:44:32,676 --> 00:44:34,427
But still...think about it.

825
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:37,719
I've already made up my mind,
but who's going to bell the cat.

826
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:40,344
Me...

827
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,052
Your girlfriend's my girlfriend.

828
00:44:42,677 --> 00:44:43,719
I'll go to Lucknow.

829
00:44:44,052 --> 00:44:45,344
And you stay back in Kanpur.

830
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:49,927
But the other day you were saying
something about your mom's transplant...

831
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:52,677
I'll manage.

832
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:55,427
You'll go to Lucknow for me.

833
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:56,469
I will.

834
00:44:56,635 --> 00:44:57,427
Don't lie to me.

835
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,052
Yes...

836
00:45:04,676 --> 00:45:06,639
"Be blessed with lush hair"

837
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:08,802
"Be blessed with new hair."

838
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:11,052
"Blessed with wind in your hair..."

839
00:45:11,135 --> 00:45:13,094
"Be hairy like never before"

840
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:15,510
"Hair is style, Hair is swag..."

841
00:45:15,635 --> 00:45:17,596
"Hair gives you attitude..."

842
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,719
"From a boring guy..."

843
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,885
"Hair will make you a cool dude..."

844
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,135
"Hair is your mother, and your father..."

845
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,427
"Hair is your friend and companion"

846
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,596
"Soon you'll have adventures..."

847
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:30,597
"...which you never thought would happen"

848
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:32,802
"Hair is peace, hair is serenity."

849
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:34,802
"Hair is the end to your troubles."

850
00:45:34,885 --> 00:45:39,219
"The magical powers to win over
a girl will come from hair"

851
00:45:39,302 --> 00:45:42,719
"Be blessed with wavy hair..."

852
00:45:42,844 --> 00:45:45,510
"Blessed with lush black hair"

853
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:48,219
"Blessed with long hair."

854
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:55,219
"Blessed with cool,
long, thick, black hair...."

855
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:16,094
'The fake hair had brought
real joy in Bala's life.'

856
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:19,927
'And dreams had come alive.'

857
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,927
Sister, don't get enough
likes on your pics...

858
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,010
...and parents can't sleep in peace.

859
00:46:29,094 --> 00:46:30,844
Guys don't give second look...

860
00:46:30,927 --> 00:46:32,676
...and you're always under pressure.

861
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,094
What to do, sis...

862
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:35,596
now you give me some tips?

863
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:38,260
A solution to get
rid of this darkness.

864
00:46:39,427 --> 00:46:41,135
Remember the story of the king...

865
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,010
Everything he touched, turned to gold.

866
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:45,844
And I have a magic trick...

867
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:48,552
...which can make anyone fair.

868
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:54,596
Pretty You...

869
00:46:54,676 --> 00:46:56,344
Made from herbal chemicals...

870
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:57,885
The real fairness trick.

871
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,344
Come...let me make you beautiful.

872
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:03,052
Cut it! Superb.

873
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:04,010
One more...

874
00:47:04,676 --> 00:47:07,052
Make her look fairer.

875
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:39,719
"I've so many complains."

876
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:43,344
"Why come after so many days."

877
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:47,052
"What did you do all this while?

878
00:47:47,552 --> 00:47:50,469
"What did you do?"

879
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,260
"Chanted your name."

880
00:47:54,344 --> 00:47:57,844
"Thought about you."

881
00:47:57,927 --> 00:47:59,760
"Chanted your name."

882
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:01,596
"Thought about you."

883
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:06,510
"Thought about you."
"Chanted your name."

884
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:09,885
Bala...

885
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:11,719
...you must have heard my name.

886
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:13,469
No, I haven't...

887
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:15,052
Then live one more life today...

888
00:48:15,635 --> 00:48:16,927
See one more dream...

889
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:18,552
Get to know one more name...

890
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:19,552
Who knows...

891
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:21,427
there might
not be a tomorrow.

892
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:25,885
Pari...

893
00:48:26,676 --> 00:48:28,219
You don't need an introduction.

894
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:31,676
Yeah...have we met before.

895
00:48:31,844 --> 00:48:33,597
We've met on Tiktok so many times.

896
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,844
I've performed the audacity
of sharing your screen.

897
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:39,010
Oh yeah...

898
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,052
The video you did...

899
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:42,802
received many likes, you know...

900
00:48:42,927 --> 00:48:44,844
We share an old bond.

901
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:45,927
What do you mean?

902
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:48,344
Whether awake or asleep,
you're all I talk about.

903
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:51,597
I carry you around all day,
keep you embraced in my arms.

904
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:52,596
Eww...

905
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:55,302
The only positive side being
on Pretty You's marketing team.

906
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:59,639
I see...so you're on Pretty
You's marketing team.

907
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:03,427
I would've quit long ago,
but you're the reason I am still here.

908
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,676
Show me your Tiktok.

909
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:09,135
Of course...

910
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,676
This is what we made, didn't we?

911
00:49:11,302 --> 00:49:12,427
Meet my mom...

912
00:49:12,676 --> 00:49:15,010
Mommy, this is Bala from Marketing.

913
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,802
Aunty, hello.

914
00:49:17,676 --> 00:49:20,552
You must show me the pictures
before using it anywhere.

915
00:49:21,052 --> 00:49:22,885
We won't compromise on the look.

916
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:24,344
Yes, of course...

917
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:26,639
I'll come down to your
house to take your approval.

918
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:27,802
Yes...

919
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:31,885
This one's my favorite.
You see when I smile...

920
00:49:37,676 --> 00:49:39,094
What are you looking at?

921
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,427
Aunty is right.

922
00:49:43,677 --> 00:49:45,802
Never compromise on looks.

923
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:48,596
You're pretty fast.

924
00:49:48,676 --> 00:49:50,802
We met yesterday, and today
you're having tea with us at home.

925
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:52,676
And tomorrow I'll
take you to the park...

926
00:49:55,219 --> 00:49:57,469
Why are you stuck in marketing?

927
00:49:57,927 --> 00:49:59,597
You should have been an artist.

928
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:00,676
Really?

929
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:03,927
I would've become an artist long ago...

930
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:06,219
...but I couldn't find inspiration.

931
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:09,885
But I guess I am finding
my inspiration now.

932
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,010
Look.

933
00:50:15,676 --> 00:50:17,469
As you said, aunty,
you wanted to see the pictures.

934
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:18,676
Here they are.

935
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:19,927
Perfect.

936
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:21,219
- They are nice, aren't they?
- Nice, nice.

937
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:24,219
- Did you bring the cheque?
- Here you go...

938
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:25,135
Your cheque

939
00:50:25,427 --> 00:50:26,885
Now send your daughter with me.

940
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:27,677
What?

941
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:29,010
To the office...

942
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:30,844
- So we can complete the formalities.
- I see.

943
00:50:32,135 --> 00:50:34,052
So this is your office.

944
00:50:34,676 --> 00:50:35,885
The rumors were right then...

945
00:50:36,552 --> 00:50:38,676
Kanpur boys cannot be trusted.

946
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:44,302
Kanpur boys are an
experience to be lived.

947
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:48,596
Where do you find the guts
to flirt so openly?

948
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:50,844
There's a little shop in Unnau...
Gattu Gut's shop.

949
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,594
I get mine from them.

950
00:50:52,885 --> 00:50:54,677
Can't you ever be serious?

951
00:50:55,676 --> 00:50:56,885
I am serious...

952
00:50:57,676 --> 00:50:58,760
...baby.

953
00:50:59,676 --> 00:51:01,927
Eww...baby?

954
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:03,302
I don't like it.

955
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,510
Sounds childish.

956
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:05,635
Then...

957
00:51:06,094 --> 00:51:07,344
what should I call you?

958
00:51:07,676 --> 00:51:08,844
Babu...

959
00:51:09,302 --> 00:51:11,344
Eww... I don't like it.

960
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:13,552
That's my laundryman's name.

961
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:17,010
Then what?

962
00:51:17,385 --> 00:51:19,135
Babyu will be, right?

963
00:51:20,135 --> 00:51:21,010
Babyu?

964
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:24,094
Baby+Babu=Babyu

965
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:26,260
Babyu...

966
00:51:26,635 --> 00:51:27,596
Babyu...

967
00:51:27,676 --> 00:51:28,927
Babyu...

968
00:51:29,676 --> 00:51:33,676
And it'll sound extra
cute in your sweet voice.

969
00:51:43,676 --> 00:51:44,676
Babyu.

970
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:53,927
"Melodious voice..."

971
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:56,927
"Sweet melody."

972
00:51:57,219 --> 00:52:00,344
"Innocent face."

973
00:52:00,676 --> 00:52:03,676
"Sweet..."

974
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,802
"bewitching eyes."

975
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:09,885
"Fiery lips."

976
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:15,052
"You make my heart skip a beat."

977
00:52:16,552 --> 00:52:21,302
"You must have read a lot of books."

978
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:26,052
"But have you ever read a face"

979
00:52:26,135 --> 00:52:30,885
"I have sweetheart, I have."

980
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:36,260
"So what's written on my face."

981
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:46,385
"My body's beautiful."

982
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,052
"Love's on a fervor."

983
00:52:48,135 --> 00:52:49,927
"I want to enchant you..."

984
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:52,010
"...with my beauty."

985
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:55,676
"Come take me in your arms."

986
00:52:55,802 --> 00:52:58,596
"No, no, no..."

987
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:02,219
"Don't steal my heart..."

988
00:53:02,302 --> 00:53:05,802
"Don't steal my heart..."

989
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:10,010
"Don't steal my heart..."

990
00:53:14,427 --> 00:53:18,010
"I am crazy about you."

991
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:22,135
"I love you."

992
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,885
"I am crazy about you."

993
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,719
"I love you."

994
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,802
"I fear of separating from you."

995
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:37,802
"I love you."

996
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:41,635
"I am crazy about you."

997
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:45,676
"I love you."

998
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:07,469
You? What are you doing here?

999
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:09,135
Courier for you, ma'am.

1000
00:54:09,344 --> 00:54:12,635
Stop joking, come up.
You'll fall.

1001
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:14,052
Careful...

1002
00:54:14,135 --> 00:54:15,885
Why didn't you come
through the front door?

1003
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:16,927
Why the window?

1004
00:54:17,052 --> 00:54:18,927
Doors are masculine,
windows are feminine.

1005
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,552
And since I am a romantic man,
I like only windows.

1006
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:23,676
True.

1007
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,677
But isn't this old school?

1008
00:54:25,802 --> 00:54:27,596
No, this is a tradition.

1009
00:54:27,676 --> 00:54:29,135
From Romeo to Murad,
everyone's done it.

1010
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,135
So why won't I?

1011
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,135
Murad?

1012
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,219
"Gully Boy... My time will arrive."

1013
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,094
Oh, yeah...I've seen it.

1014
00:54:42,135 --> 00:54:44,219
Do you know how
I feel when I am with you?

1015
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:45,676
How?

1016
00:54:46,552 --> 00:54:48,676
Like you're a movie...

1017
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:52,927
Every time we meet,
you make me laugh...

1018
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:55,094
and make me feel nice.

1019
00:54:56,676 --> 00:54:58,094
But I am also scared...

1020
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:00,844
that someday it might come to an end.

1021
00:55:01,427 --> 00:55:03,010
I am not some film, Babyu.

1022
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:06,010
I am like a never-ending series.

1023
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:11,260
You'll grow tired,
but I'll keep going on-and-on-and-on...

1024
00:55:14,677 --> 00:55:15,719
Well...

1025
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,010
...you can come
inside if you like?

1026
00:55:18,094 --> 00:55:19,135
Seriously?

1027
00:55:20,469 --> 00:55:25,635
The room's masculine,
but the bedsheets feminine.

1028
00:55:48,427 --> 00:55:51,010
I never realized how
two months just swooped by.

1029
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,427
Isn't it?

1030
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,844
I must return to Kanpur tomorrow.

1031
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,676
But I'll come every week to see you.

1032
00:55:58,844 --> 00:56:00,010
Promise?

1033
00:56:00,427 --> 00:56:01,676
Promise...

1034
00:56:03,676 --> 00:56:06,596
- Dinner's served, dear.
- Leave.

1035
00:56:06,676 --> 00:56:07,676
Go on, go have dinner.

1036
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:08,676
Fine...

1037
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:10,885
Now leave.

1038
00:56:18,344 --> 00:56:22,597
'With his new hair
and newfound confidence...'

1039
00:56:22,677 --> 00:56:30,719
'...Bala came like a brand new
Rolls Royce on the streets of Kanpur.'

1040
00:56:41,135 --> 00:56:43,719
He was no longer joke of the town...

1041
00:56:44,302 --> 00:56:47,010
...but the talk of the town.

1042
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:52,969
Mummy Papa. Don't I look like a star?

1043
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:57,885
- Bala?
- Bala, my son...you're back.

1044
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,676
Bless you.

1045
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:04,802
- Mom, look...
- Hello, aunty.

1046
00:57:04,885 --> 00:57:06,596
Hello, dear. God bless you.

1047
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:07,596
Papa...

1048
00:57:07,676 --> 00:57:09,010
Hello, papa
- Hello.

1049
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:10,596
Can you feel it?

1050
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,427
Yes, yes, I can feel it.

1051
00:57:12,552 --> 00:57:14,427
He's a changed man now.

1052
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:17,802
Even I am thinking of moving
to Lucknow after retirement.

1053
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:20,052
That won't do you any good.

1054
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:23,094
I am putting you back on Marketing.

1055
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:25,676
Start with the presentations
and let your rocket soar.

1056
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:34,927
Tell me the secret as well, brother.

1057
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:36,719
For growing new hair,
my wedding is next month.

1058
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:38,719
I don't tell this secret to anyone,
but for you, I'll make an exception.

1059
00:57:38,844 --> 00:57:39,427
Hold this.

1060
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,260
The naïve population of our country...

1061
00:57:42,676 --> 00:57:45,677
...when they believe our politicians.

1062
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:50,927
- Why wouldn't they believe Bala's miracle story.
- Give me.

1063
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:52,552
Me too.

1064
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:54,010
Have you lost your mind?

1065
00:57:54,094 --> 00:57:56,635
Everyone will get one.

1066
00:57:57,052 --> 00:57:57,677
Look...

1067
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,927
Wow...so beautiful.

1068
00:58:00,302 --> 00:58:03,552
Help me out with this first.
With this Insta pic.

1069
00:58:04,135 --> 00:58:05,676
Wow...

1070
00:58:06,427 --> 00:58:07,427
That's her.

1071
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:11,596
what's going on?

1072
00:58:11,676 --> 00:58:13,094
Look... take a look.

1073
00:58:13,927 --> 00:58:15,094
- What is it?
- His angel.

1074
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:22,135
The nylon hair suits you.

1075
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:34,885
Listen...

1076
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,885
What do you think of Bala?

1077
00:58:38,676 --> 00:58:39,885
As***le

1078
00:58:40,676 --> 00:58:41,469
Me too.

1079
00:58:42,094 --> 00:58:43,052
But imagine...

1080
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:47,135
an as***le like him scores
with such a gorgeous girl.

1081
00:58:47,676 --> 00:58:49,260
And that too the Pretty you model.

1082
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:51,596
And look at you...

1083
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:52,927
You don't like anyone.

1084
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:57,344
Don't take advantage of this tender
moment to emotionally blackmail me.

1085
00:58:57,469 --> 00:58:59,010
I've seen this world
more than you, dear.

1086
00:58:59,094 --> 00:59:02,596
And all I know is that
the body has its own needs...

1087
00:59:02,676 --> 00:59:04,719
...which needs to be satisfied.

1088
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,135
Yeah...

1089
00:59:07,885 --> 00:59:11,927
My-my, aunty...body's needs, huh!

1090
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:12,927
Shameless...

1091
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,344
Honestly speaking I believe...

1092
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:20,676
I'll never see you getting married.

1093
00:59:20,885 --> 00:59:23,639
I'll be dead long before
you decide to marry.

1094
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:24,844
Aunty...

1095
00:59:25,676 --> 00:59:27,844
you're like Thanos.

1096
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:30,885
People will come and go,
but you'll be still here.

1097
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:32,676
Who on earth is Thanos?

1098
00:59:32,927 --> 00:59:34,885
America's Superman.

1099
00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:38,010
Drop that topic...enough about America.

1100
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:42,052
The kangaroo from Australia's been
texting you why don't you reply.

1101
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,135
Stop snooping around my phone.

1102
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,260
I will...

1103
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:48,676
Body's needs

1104
01:00:13,669 --> 01:00:15,010
Why are you going back?

1105
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:16,927
No, I...

1106
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:18,427
What are you doing?

1107
01:00:18,677 --> 01:00:19,719
Pari..

1108
01:00:20,302 --> 01:00:21,927
You don't even kiss properly.

1109
01:00:22,594 --> 01:00:23,552
I needed some fresh air.

1110
01:00:23,676 --> 01:00:25,927
I drove all the way from Lucknow.

1111
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:27,677
You spoiled the mood.

1112
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:30,219
Now you only say something.

1113
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,302
Actually, Pari,

1114
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,885
I've been trying to tell you something
important for a long time now.

1115
01:00:43,385 --> 01:00:44,844
Yeah...tell me.

1116
01:00:46,635 --> 01:00:49,677
What if someday you
find out that I have a flaw?

1117
01:00:53,802 --> 01:00:55,597
That Cheapo Vani's
beau is the one with flaws.

1118
01:00:55,677 --> 01:00:56,844
Look here.

1119
01:00:56,927 --> 01:00:58,052
She sent me this selfie.

1120
01:00:59,052 --> 01:00:59,885
How is he?

1121
01:01:00,177 --> 01:01:01,596
"Baldy."

1122
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:03,010
He looks fine.

1123
01:01:03,635 --> 01:01:04,719
You call this fine.

1124
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:07,676
Yeah...

1125
01:01:09,135 --> 01:01:11,802
Our wedding selfie should be best.

1126
01:01:14,676 --> 01:01:15,927
Our wedding...

1127
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:17,219
Yeah.

1128
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:19,802
What?

1129
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,219
Won't you marry me?

1130
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:22,596
I will...of course I will.

1131
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:23,639
Tell me...

1132
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:26,344
I mean if you're just looking for fun...

1133
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:28,885
Don't be ridiculous. I love you.

1134
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:29,802
Then?

1135
01:01:30,135 --> 01:01:32,094
Why did your face
turn pale when I said our wedding?

1136
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:34,260
You're so beautiful...

1137
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:38,010
...I thought it'll take me a
couple of years before you say yes.

1138
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,676
I thought that too.

1139
01:01:40,052 --> 01:01:40,927
So...

1140
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:42,676
You see...

1141
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:44,469
I am old enough to get married.

1142
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:46,094
How much longer am I going to wait?

1143
01:01:46,676 --> 01:01:48,219
Mom-dad will grow desperate...

1144
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:50,676
...and then force me
to marry some random guy.

1145
01:01:51,052 --> 01:01:54,885
So why don't we get
married before that?

1146
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:56,596
Let's do it.

1147
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:57,844
- Yeah?
- Yea...

1148
01:01:58,052 --> 01:01:59,302
- Yeah?
- Yea...

1149
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:02,052
Babyu...
I love you, Babyu.

1150
01:02:08,802 --> 01:02:10,844
We'll get the best hair stylists
in Lucknow to help us prep.

1151
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:13,927
And our hairstyle
will be the best, Babyu.

1152
01:02:14,302 --> 01:02:17,427
You see, at wedding functions
hair styling is everything.

1153
01:02:17,552 --> 01:02:21,596
"The wedding procession will arrive..."

1154
01:02:21,676 --> 01:02:25,885
"...bringing your destruction."

1155
01:02:26,635 --> 01:02:29,469
I want us to look like Virushka...

1156
01:02:29,635 --> 01:02:31,260
Ranveer-Deepika.

1157
01:02:31,344 --> 01:02:33,844
Our wedding pics
should go viral, Babyu.

1158
01:02:33,927 --> 01:02:36,010
We can compromise on the attire.

1159
01:02:36,094 --> 01:02:37,885
But what's the centre of attraction?

1160
01:02:38,094 --> 01:02:38,844
Hairstyling.

1161
01:02:40,676 --> 01:02:42,010
And remember what mom always says...

1162
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:45,676
- Looks..
- Never, Compromise on looks.

1163
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,010
I'll get the Ballerina hairstyle...

1164
01:02:49,094 --> 01:02:51,344
...and you'll get the long pompadour...

1165
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:52,676
Long what?

1166
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:54,885
Long pompadour style...

1167
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,302
Look... It's like this...

1168
01:02:56,427 --> 01:02:58,552
Like Captain America.

1169
01:02:58,676 --> 01:02:59,844
It'll look amazing on you.

1170
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:01,427
You'll look handsome in it.

1171
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:05,052
"Bride's on her way..."

1172
01:03:05,135 --> 01:03:08,844
"...your secret shall be revealed."

1173
01:03:10,344 --> 01:03:13,676
"Careful, Bala."

1174
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:29,052
"Bala learned the hard way
that liars never prosper...

1175
01:03:29,135 --> 01:03:33,639
"...he didn't know what to say."

1176
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:35,844
"He was flabbergasted."

1177
01:03:40,635 --> 01:03:43,094
"Here it comes."

1178
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,010
"Here it comes."

1179
01:03:59,676 --> 01:04:01,219
Why do you look nervous?

1180
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:06,219
I've been trying to tell
you something for a long time now.

1181
01:04:08,676 --> 01:04:09,469
I know...

1182
01:04:11,427 --> 01:04:12,635
Know what?

1183
01:04:12,927 --> 01:04:14,844
That thing you want to tell me.

1184
01:04:15,927 --> 01:04:17,302
I can see it.

1185
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:19,135
What can you see?

1186
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:21,302
Your hesitation.

1187
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:26,676
Chill dude, chill...

1188
01:04:27,676 --> 01:04:28,510
I know...

1189
01:04:28,802 --> 01:04:31,260
...my family's in a
slightly better position than you.

1190
01:04:31,427 --> 01:04:32,052
So what...

1191
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:33,676
We aren't exactly millionaires.

1192
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:36,510
I'll adjust.

1193
01:04:37,135 --> 01:04:38,469
You don't worry.

1194
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:42,510
Yes, fine, but...

1195
01:04:42,635 --> 01:04:43,719
Is it my mom and dad...?

1196
01:04:44,302 --> 01:04:46,885
Mom and dad have
already said yes, Babyu.

1197
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:50,635
And if they change their mind,
we'll run away and get married.

1198
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:54,676
Our daughter is the
supermodel of Lucknow.

1199
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,427
We've received many
esteemed proposals.

1200
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,135
But she likes Bala...

1201
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:01,596
Anyway...

1202
01:05:01,676 --> 01:05:03,596
The girls at Kanpur
must be heartbroken as well.

1203
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:05,676
That's Bala you know, he's the best.

1204
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,635
Most edible bachelor.

1205
01:05:10,427 --> 01:05:12,135
You must have an
air-conditioner at home.

1206
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:14,676
Our daughter can't sleep without it.

1207
01:05:16,676 --> 01:05:20,427
If both the teams have come
to an understanding...

1208
01:05:20,676 --> 01:05:22,844
...do we understand
we've all come to terms.

1209
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:41,302
Have you told her?

1210
01:05:44,052 --> 01:05:45,552
What's the meaning of this?

1211
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:46,719
I almost told her.

1212
01:05:46,844 --> 01:05:49,219
What's the meaning of almost?

1213
01:05:50,469 --> 01:05:51,052
Huh...

1214
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:54,260
Bala...think about it.

1215
01:05:54,552 --> 01:05:55,469
Are you sure you want to marry her?

1216
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,802
Whether he marries her or anyone else...

1217
01:05:57,885 --> 01:05:59,676
...but he should tell her.

1218
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:01,676
Have you lost your mind, brother?

1219
01:06:02,135 --> 01:06:03,052
Why tell her?

1220
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:05,597
This is my wedding we're
talking about and not a joke.

1221
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:06,802
I must tell her...

1222
01:06:06,927 --> 01:06:09,676
Of course, you must tell her.

1223
01:06:10,219 --> 01:06:11,639
But after the wedding.

1224
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:12,719
But that's cheating.

1225
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,927
Don't try to be oversmart.

1226
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:19,596
Our society is a
male-dominant society...

1227
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,676
...and this tradition's
been followed for many years.

1228
01:06:21,802 --> 01:06:22,719
Meaning?

1229
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:29,676
Meaning...in our society, a guy's
flaws are not considered as flaws.

1230
01:06:30,385 --> 01:06:31,802
I used to get fits.

1231
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:35,260
But did I tell your sister-in-law?

1232
01:06:35,427 --> 01:06:37,596
Look, there are dozens
of things about men...

1233
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:40,427
...which the women find
out after the marriage.

1234
01:06:40,676 --> 01:06:41,596
Yeah...

1235
01:06:41,676 --> 01:06:44,844
And she doesn't exactly
have an option after the marriage.

1236
01:06:45,676 --> 01:06:46,596
How can I lie...

1237
01:06:46,676 --> 01:06:48,719
Even Yudhisthir lied once.

1238
01:06:48,927 --> 01:06:50,135
You're just an ordinary guy.

1239
01:06:50,676 --> 01:06:51,719
I don't think this is right...

1240
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,302
Look...for no rhyme or reason...

1241
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,719
...whatever I say is the law.

1242
01:06:55,844 --> 01:06:57,844
It's the least you got
to do if you want to marry her.

1243
01:06:59,676 --> 01:07:03,135
One day before the wedding,
I'll give you a diamond facial.

1244
01:07:03,676 --> 01:07:04,927
You're going to shine.

1245
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:10,552
What are you typing?

1246
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,719
Confession.

1247
01:07:12,676 --> 01:07:15,427
I don't have the guts to
say the truth, so I'm texting her.

1248
01:07:16,427 --> 01:07:17,302
To whom?

1249
01:07:17,676 --> 01:07:19,927
I am confessing my mistake
to your sister-in-law.

1250
01:07:20,802 --> 01:07:23,676
Look, brother Bala,
only three days left for the wedding.

1251
01:07:23,802 --> 01:07:25,676
Think before confessing.

1252
01:07:26,552 --> 01:07:27,676
Bala...

1253
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:30,219
what are you writing?

1254
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:31,676
Tell me.

1255
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,010
I wrote...

1256
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:37,676
"Babyu, I wanted to tell you this but
couldn't muster the courage to do so".

1257
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:39,427
"I've no hair on my head.

1258
01:07:39,677 --> 01:07:40,677
I am bald."

1259
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,676
"This hair is fake..."

1260
01:07:43,302 --> 01:07:46,510
"I am sorry for confessing so late,
but I didn't want to lose you."

1261
01:07:46,635 --> 01:07:49,676
"If you've forgiven me, then call
back otherwise I'll take a hint."

1262
01:07:50,676 --> 01:07:51,802
Are you high?

1263
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,596
- Delete it.
- I am sending it.

1264
01:07:53,676 --> 01:07:55,844
Bala...for the sake of whatever
hair's left, don't send it.

1265
01:07:55,927 --> 01:07:58,802
- I'm going to send it right now.
- You can't send it.

1266
01:07:58,885 --> 01:08:00,719
Brother said...

1267
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:03,219
Don't you want to get married...

1268
01:08:03,302 --> 01:08:04,135
It's sent.

1269
01:08:11,302 --> 01:08:12,802
You ruined everything.

1270
01:08:13,676 --> 01:08:15,302
I dyed my hair hot-pink
for the wedding. See...

1271
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:19,552
Finally, you found a hottie like her...
I mean sister-in-law.

1272
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:21,802
You can kiss the wedding goodbye now.

1273
01:08:23,552 --> 01:08:24,927
Confession. Are you a Christian?

1274
01:08:26,677 --> 01:08:28,135
Thank God you didn't get a tattoo...

1275
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,676
Otherwise getting it
off would've been extra.

1276
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,719
Pacing around won't help.

1277
01:08:34,635 --> 01:08:37,802
Even God couldn't have found
a beautiful girl like her for you.

1278
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:46,844
Hello.

1279
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:48,052
Bala...

1280
01:08:48,135 --> 01:08:51,302
Sorry, I couldn't reply.
I am busy with the rituals.

1281
01:08:51,676 --> 01:08:53,510
You mean you don't have a problem.

1282
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:58,219
I knew you will call me back.

1283
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,219
I knew my love was true.

1284
01:09:00,676 --> 01:09:02,802
I knew you will accept
me the way I am.

1285
01:09:02,927 --> 01:09:05,677
Yeah...I like the way you are.

1286
01:09:06,427 --> 01:09:07,635
Can you do one thing...

1287
01:09:07,802 --> 01:09:09,596
Can you install an AC in the bedroom?

1288
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:11,844
I'll put a dozen ACs in the room.

1289
01:09:13,552 --> 01:09:15,219
I love you, Babyu.

1290
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:17,802
I love you, Babyu.

1291
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,219
I love you.

1292
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:21,844
What did she say?

1293
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:26,885
Did she say yes?

1294
01:09:27,677 --> 01:09:28,719
With this bald head...

1295
01:09:28,927 --> 01:09:32,052
Yes, she did... She said
yes accepting all kinds of bald...

1296
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:34,302
Brother Bala...

1297
01:09:36,676 --> 01:09:39,597
On the occasion of Bala's wedding...

1298
01:09:39,677 --> 01:09:42,927
...here's a special number
from Soni Band.

1299
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,219
"Tequilla."

1300
01:10:06,427 --> 01:10:07,676
"Tequilla."

1301
01:10:15,677 --> 01:10:17,597
"It's a day of joy..."

1302
01:10:17,677 --> 01:10:20,427
"...feeling on the top."

1303
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:23,834
"We're gonna mix soda, water,
lime and drink what."

1304
01:10:23,914 --> 01:10:25,094
"Tequilla."

1305
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:37,596
"Son has taken the plunge,
Tomorrow he'll become a father"

1306
01:10:37,676 --> 01:10:41,347
"With your fathers money
What will you drink now."

1307
01:10:41,427 --> 01:10:42,427
"Tequilla."

1308
01:10:43,094 --> 01:10:44,302
Hello.

1309
01:10:44,676 --> 01:10:45,676
Hello.

1310
01:10:52,094 --> 01:10:53,676
Can we meet now?

1311
01:10:54,594 --> 01:10:56,385
"Get in the groove."

1312
01:10:56,676 --> 01:10:58,552
"Take a shot."

1313
01:10:58,676 --> 01:11:00,427
"Or I'll give you a tight slap."

1314
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,635
"Tequilla."

1315
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,260
Brother Bala...

1316
01:11:15,746 --> 01:11:16,597
"Tequilla."

1317
01:11:16,677 --> 01:11:17,802
Brother Bala...

1318
01:11:18,676 --> 01:11:20,469
What did you send me?

1319
01:11:20,552 --> 01:11:21,719
Take a look.

1320
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,010
Let's talk later.

1321
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,927
Take a look. Please...

1322
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:26,552
I don't get it...

1323
01:11:26,676 --> 01:11:28,510
You won't listen, will you...

1324
01:11:33,219 --> 01:11:37,597
"Say something...
Who did you chose?"

1325
01:11:37,677 --> 01:11:41,844
"Where do you think you're going
leaving your friends alone."

1326
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:44,180
- Brother Bala, shall I delete it?
- "This happiness..."

1327
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,469
"...doesn't last for too long."

1328
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,052
"You're smiling today,
but soon you'll be in tears."

1329
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,677
"Time will tell..."

1330
01:11:52,802 --> 01:11:54,639
"...what will be the result."

1331
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,677
"Whether your marriage is hit or flop."

1332
01:11:56,802 --> 01:11:58,219
"Tequilla."

1333
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,177
"Tequilla."

1334
01:12:20,676 --> 01:12:21,510
"Tequilla."

1335
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:23,177
- Thank you
- You're welcome

1336
01:12:24,717 --> 01:12:26,676
By the way, you're looking beautiful.

1337
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:29,597
Thank you.

1338
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:31,676
Actually Thanks for coming.

1339
01:12:32,344 --> 01:12:33,802
I thought you wouldn't come.

1340
01:12:34,676 --> 01:12:35,719
Sorry for all those messages.

1341
01:12:35,844 --> 01:12:40,219
But first of all, I want to
apologize for what happened the other day.

1342
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:42,676
Mom was wrong.

1343
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:45,052
She shouldn't have said that.

1344
01:12:45,885 --> 01:12:47,802
But it's a misunderstanding.

1345
01:12:47,927 --> 01:12:51,219
Rohan, my ears are
extra-sensitive to the word dark.

1346
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,676
I can hear it from a distance of 50 ft..

1347
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:57,427
But mom's not like that at all.

1348
01:12:57,677 --> 01:12:59,596
She was under a different
impression about you.

1349
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:00,719
First she...

1350
01:13:01,427 --> 01:13:04,639
She saw the wedding pics,
then the Insta pics...

1351
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,885
I don't know what
you're trying to say.

1352
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:10,677
I am not on Instagram...

1353
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,427
Your profile...

1354
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:17,719
If I was in your place even
I would've reacted in the same way.

1355
01:13:19,177 --> 01:13:22,844
The other day I thought these
things don't matter to you.

1356
01:13:23,885 --> 01:13:25,260
But after seeing your insta pics...

1357
01:13:25,344 --> 01:13:26,885
...we were a little confused.

1358
01:13:34,635 --> 01:13:35,719
Babyu...

1359
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,676
Let's make a Tiktok
of our wedding night.

1360
01:13:39,635 --> 01:13:40,719
Coming.

1361
01:13:41,094 --> 01:13:42,676
What are you doing?

1362
01:13:45,844 --> 01:13:48,802
Come on, Babyu.
What's taking you so long?

1363
01:13:49,677 --> 01:13:51,010
Coming...

1364
01:13:51,676 --> 01:13:53,219
I am sleeping.

1365
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:55,885
What are you doing?

1366
01:13:58,844 --> 01:14:00,469
Babyu...

1367
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,344
Come na

1368
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:11,802
My heart...beats for you.

1369
01:14:55,135 --> 01:14:55,927
Babyu...

1370
01:14:56,052 --> 01:14:57,676
I was about to tell you.

1371
01:14:57,844 --> 01:15:01,676
You really thought I wouldn't
know if you don't tell me.

1372
01:15:03,427 --> 01:15:04,719
I already knew.

1373
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:08,427
You look hotter this way.

1374
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,719
Come here, Babyu.

1375
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:54,635
Latika....come in.

1376
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:56,427
You left without having
dinner last night.

1377
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,219
Where is Bala?

1378
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,844
- Do you need anything?
- Please call him, aunty.

1379
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:00,260
It was his wedding night yesterday.

1380
01:16:00,427 --> 01:16:01,639
Who wakes up early
the following morning?

1381
01:16:01,719 --> 01:16:02,676
Bala!

1382
01:16:02,927 --> 01:16:04,927
- Bala! Bala!
- Why are you screaming?

1383
01:16:06,219 --> 01:16:06,597
You?

1384
01:16:06,677 --> 01:16:07,552
Come down.

1385
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:08,713
Come down.

1386
01:16:08,793 --> 01:16:10,094
Why are you fuming?
Latika...

1387
01:16:10,219 --> 01:16:11,676
- Don't go up there.
- What's happening?

1388
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:13,802
- What's going on?
- Who do you think you are?

1389
01:16:14,552 --> 01:16:16,094
Who do you think you are?

1390
01:16:16,219 --> 01:16:18,052
- Will you tell me what happened?
- What is this?

1391
01:16:18,676 --> 01:16:19,764
- What is this?
- What is it?

1392
01:16:19,844 --> 01:16:21,719
- Stop making a scene, let's go downstairs.
- I am making a scene.

1393
01:16:21,802 --> 01:16:22,930
What is she talking about?

1394
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:24,719
Stop misbehaving with me.

1395
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:25,844
Why did you do it?

1396
01:16:25,927 --> 01:16:27,552
You're looking nice.
What's wrong in it?

1397
01:16:27,676 --> 01:16:31,260
Who are you to decide whether
I am looking nice or not?

1398
01:16:31,469 --> 01:16:32,219
Who are you?

1399
01:16:32,302 --> 01:16:33,052
I am no one...

1400
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:35,844
But your aunt forced me to do this.
Why would I do it?

1401
01:16:35,927 --> 01:16:36,719
Ohh...

1402
01:16:36,844 --> 01:16:40,219
Because Bala's a little kid,
he'll do as aunty tells him to do.

1403
01:16:40,302 --> 01:16:40,927
No...

1404
01:16:41,676 --> 01:16:43,844
But whatever I did was
for your own good, Latika.

1405
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:46,802
Let me decide what's
good and what's not for me.

1406
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,596
You have a problem with your baldness...

1407
01:16:49,676 --> 01:16:53,052
...then you can hide your
bald patch with this fake hair.

1408
01:16:53,135 --> 01:16:56,010
I don't have a problem
with my complexion, Bala.

1409
01:16:56,302 --> 01:16:58,219
I don't need this fake whiteness...

1410
01:16:59,676 --> 01:17:04,844
If you try to interfere
in my life again...

1411
01:17:05,676 --> 01:17:10,969
...then I'll beat the
remaining hair out too.

1412
01:17:11,094 --> 01:17:13,597
- Latika...
- Stupid moron...

1413
01:17:13,677 --> 01:17:15,552
How dare she talk to Bala like this?

1414
01:17:15,676 --> 01:17:17,927
Talk to her Indira
What is the meaning of this...

1415
01:17:18,052 --> 01:17:19,302
What did you do?

1416
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:20,635
What did you do?

1417
01:17:39,969 --> 01:17:41,219
What did she say?

1418
01:17:43,052 --> 01:17:43,844
What was she saying?

1419
01:17:45,219 --> 01:17:46,219
Nothing...

1420
01:17:47,427 --> 01:17:48,260
She...

1421
01:17:49,302 --> 01:17:52,302
She's my childhood friend.
We often squabble like this.

1422
01:17:52,385 --> 01:17:53,427
What was she saying?

1423
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:56,676
Show me.

1424
01:17:57,676 --> 01:17:59,676
Listen to me...

1425
01:17:59,802 --> 01:18:01,596
Let me explain, Babyu...

1426
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:02,302
Show me!

1427
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,802
Listen to me.

1428
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:28,010
You are bald.

1429
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:31,635
My husband is bald.

1430
01:18:32,844 --> 01:18:34,676
My husband is bald.

1431
01:18:35,302 --> 01:18:36,927
My husband is bald!

1432
01:18:37,677 --> 01:18:40,010
My husband...

1433
01:18:40,302 --> 01:18:43,219
My husband is bald!

1434
01:18:44,927 --> 01:18:46,844
My husband is bald!

1435
01:18:48,635 --> 01:18:50,596
My husband is bald!

1436
01:18:50,676 --> 01:18:52,719
My husband is bald!

1437
01:18:55,719 --> 01:18:57,802
My husband is bald!

1438
01:18:58,427 --> 01:18:59,719
Why are you over acting?

1439
01:18:59,844 --> 01:19:02,552
It's worse than Vani's husband.

1440
01:19:02,676 --> 01:19:04,260
Calm down and listen...

1441
01:19:04,676 --> 01:19:06,344
Let's talk...

1442
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:08,094
I don't want to talk.

1443
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:10,676
- Babyu...
- My husband is bald!

1444
01:19:14,718 --> 01:19:16,596
Babyu, why did you close the door?

1445
01:19:16,676 --> 01:19:17,927
Babyu, why did you close the door?

1446
01:19:18,052 --> 01:19:18,719
Open the door.

1447
01:19:18,844 --> 01:19:20,469
I love you.

1448
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,677
You asked for an AC,
and I got it for you.

1449
01:19:23,844 --> 01:19:25,552
Babyu, open the door.

1450
01:19:25,676 --> 01:19:28,552
I texted you and said that I am bald.

1451
01:19:28,676 --> 01:19:30,302
But it got sent to someone else.

1452
01:19:30,427 --> 01:19:32,639
How is it my fault? Tell me...
I had lost my mind.

1453
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:35,596
Babyu, don't do something
stupid behind closed doors.

1454
01:19:35,676 --> 01:19:37,302
Babyu, please...don't commit suicide.

1455
01:19:37,469 --> 01:19:39,597
Please...I apologize.
I am sorry.

1456
01:19:39,677 --> 01:19:41,677
Babyu, I am sorry.
Please open the door.

1457
01:19:41,802 --> 01:19:43,135
Babyu...

1458
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:45,885
Where are you taking the bag?

1459
01:19:46,469 --> 01:19:47,430
Keep it...
Leave...

1460
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,469
No no

1461
01:19:48,676 --> 01:19:49,639
Let go.

1462
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:52,010
This is a new bag.
You'll ruin it.

1463
01:19:54,052 --> 01:19:54,885
Let it be.

1464
01:19:55,302 --> 01:19:56,597
Don't do it.

1465
01:19:56,677 --> 01:19:58,135
Don't go, please don't go.

1466
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:58,719
Pari.

1467
01:19:58,844 --> 01:20:01,135
How can you leave
for such a small thing?

1468
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:02,052
Pari!

1469
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:04,010
Let go. I said let go.

1470
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:08,885
Pari...

1471
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:10,676
Go on.

1472
01:20:13,302 --> 01:20:13,802
Babyu...

1473
01:20:16,528 --> 01:20:17,260
Babyu...

1474
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:19,010
Pari.

1475
01:20:19,676 --> 01:20:20,302
Pari.

1476
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:57,885
'When your bride leaves,
you lose your reputation.'

1477
01:21:06,676 --> 01:21:08,219
Son... Bless you.

1478
01:21:08,302 --> 01:21:09,802
What's wrong?

1479
01:21:10,052 --> 01:21:12,219
- You guys fought on the first day?
- Where is Pari?

1480
01:21:12,302 --> 01:21:13,677
She's upstairs in her room.
She didn't tell us a thing.

1481
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,639
- Okay...
- She isn't talking to us.

1482
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:16,927
Why don't you tell
us if something's wrong?

1483
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:17,719
We'll explain to her.

1484
01:21:17,844 --> 01:21:19,596
Why don't you explain to him?
I am sure he's responsible.

1485
01:21:19,676 --> 01:21:20,677
There's nothing to explain Pari.

1486
01:21:22,676 --> 01:21:23,510
Explain what?

1487
01:21:23,676 --> 01:21:24,597
Ask him.

1488
01:21:24,677 --> 01:21:26,260
Are you having an affair on the side?

1489
01:21:26,427 --> 01:21:28,844
Stop testing me...
I am already quite stressed.

1490
01:21:28,927 --> 01:21:29,719
Let me go.

1491
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:31,676
But son...

1492
01:21:32,552 --> 01:21:33,802
Take the helmet off first.

1493
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:41,676
How can you leave
home like this, Babyu?

1494
01:21:43,488 --> 01:21:44,635
Sorry...

1495
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:48,219
I tried to tell you about it...

1496
01:21:48,302 --> 01:21:51,635
It was on the tip of my tongue,
but I couldn't tell you.

1497
01:21:52,135 --> 01:21:53,885
Have you ever imagined why...

1498
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,427
I didn't want to lose you.

1499
01:21:57,219 --> 01:21:58,760
I was very insecure about you.

1500
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,802
I even sent you a text
but it got sent to someone else.

1501
01:22:00,885 --> 01:22:02,427
It's not my fault.

1502
01:22:02,635 --> 01:22:03,597
Whatever. Leave it.

1503
01:22:03,677 --> 01:22:04,596
How can I just leave it?

1504
01:22:04,676 --> 01:22:06,344
Be a good Babyu and let's go home.

1505
01:22:06,469 --> 01:22:08,635
- I don't want to be with you.
- Why not?

1506
01:22:08,715 --> 01:22:09,802
What have I done?

1507
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,676
Loot or plundered?
Am I a terrorist?

1508
01:22:13,135 --> 01:22:14,719
I just have less hair...

1509
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:15,844
Less...

1510
01:22:16,676 --> 01:22:17,427
Less...

1511
01:22:18,676 --> 01:22:19,719
You have no hair...

1512
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:23,596
Its all about style...

1513
01:22:23,676 --> 01:22:25,052
Even Rajnikant is bald.

1514
01:22:25,135 --> 01:22:26,676
Don't force the issue.

1515
01:22:27,552 --> 01:22:29,719
I'll wear a wig.
I look so much better...

1516
01:22:30,676 --> 01:22:33,596
- No one will know...
- But I know, what about that?

1517
01:22:33,676 --> 01:22:34,885
You're making a fuss
over a little thing.

1518
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:37,010
Maybe for you, but not for me

1519
01:22:38,676 --> 01:22:41,719
Looks matter for me.
Why don't you get it?

1520
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:46,676
I never scored more
than 45% in my studies.

1521
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,677
But all the guys
used to hover around me.

1522
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:49,676
Why?

1523
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:51,672
Because I was good looking.

1524
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:54,719
I got attention all my life. Why?

1525
01:22:55,677 --> 01:22:57,676
Because I am good looking.

1526
01:22:57,844 --> 01:23:01,427
I got some modelling assignments,
fame, my hoardings were all over...

1527
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:02,635
Why?

1528
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:04,635
Because I am good looking.

1529
01:23:04,844 --> 01:23:07,219
I get 500 comments for every post...

1530
01:23:07,302 --> 01:23:09,676
...and 499 out of them
say looking good.

1531
01:23:10,676 --> 01:23:12,510
That's all that matters in my life.

1532
01:23:13,052 --> 01:23:14,427
Looking good.

1533
01:23:15,676 --> 01:23:18,676
So when the only thing I ever
wanted was a good looking hubby...

1534
01:23:19,552 --> 01:23:20,676
...then was I wrong?

1535
01:23:23,427 --> 01:23:26,677
It might be a stupid criteria for
you, but that's all there is for me.

1536
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:28,676
Looking good.

1537
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:35,260
So what should I do?

1538
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:42,552
Go away.

1539
01:24:00,052 --> 01:24:01,676
I'll wait for you.

1540
01:24:29,552 --> 01:24:33,639
If you get bitten by a dog,
you got to take 14 injections.

1541
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:36,596
But if your own dog bites you...

1542
01:24:36,676 --> 01:24:38,469
...then you need 28.

1543
01:24:40,594 --> 01:24:43,676
Bala was bitten by his own mentality.

1544
01:25:07,552 --> 01:25:09,135
'I feel you're like a film...'

1545
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:13,552
'Whenever we meet,
you make me laugh...'

1546
01:25:13,676 --> 01:25:15,510
'...and feel very good.'

1547
01:25:16,676 --> 01:25:20,676
'But I am scared that someday
this film will come to an end.'

1548
01:25:29,635 --> 01:25:32,094
I feel really lucky, Manju.

1549
01:25:33,676 --> 01:25:35,260
Even I was bald.

1550
01:25:37,219 --> 01:25:38,677
But you never walked out on me.

1551
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:41,219
She is my daughter.

1552
01:25:41,635 --> 01:25:43,676
And she's not a deserter.

1553
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:48,552
Now, do you know why
I stayed back for 30 years?

1554
01:25:50,676 --> 01:25:51,676
Goodnight.

1555
01:25:56,676 --> 01:25:59,719
Bala, you didn't invite
us to the wedding...

1556
01:25:59,844 --> 01:26:02,676
...but at least invite
us over for home cooked dinner by bhabhi

1557
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:04,677
She's gone home to Lucknow.

1558
01:26:05,802 --> 01:26:07,552
Some rituals are still
pending on their side.

1559
01:26:07,844 --> 01:26:09,552
I'll invite you over once she's back.

1560
01:26:11,469 --> 01:26:14,052
"Love is what it was."

1561
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:16,596
"And still is."

1562
01:26:16,676 --> 01:26:21,510
"And shall always remain."

1563
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:24,510
"You were mine..."

1564
01:26:24,635 --> 01:26:27,135
"And still are."

1565
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:31,802
"And shall always be mine."

1566
01:26:32,635 --> 01:26:34,844
"Whether you know or you don't..."

1567
01:26:35,052 --> 01:26:37,722
"Whether you don't believe me."

1568
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:40,344
"Whether you know or you don't..."

1569
01:26:40,469 --> 01:26:42,885
"Whether you don't believe me."

1570
01:26:43,094 --> 01:26:48,344
"But someday you'll say this too."

1571
01:26:49,552 --> 01:26:51,671
Let it rip, dude.
- Coming...

1572
01:26:51,751 --> 01:26:55,596
Here it comes. Here it comes...
- "Your love will stay..."

1573
01:26:55,676 --> 01:27:01,219
- More feelings...
- "...in my heart as pain"

1574
01:27:01,302 --> 01:27:02,302
Emotion... Emotion...

1575
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:12,676
"My pain shall stay with you
forever as love"

1576
01:27:23,676 --> 01:27:26,676
Once Jaya ma'am gets upset
with Bachchan sir and leaves.

1577
01:27:27,219 --> 01:27:28,676
Bachchan sir says in his own style...

1578
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:32,596
Let's go, Let's go...
Let's go to Manali...Kulu..

1579
01:27:32,676 --> 01:27:34,885
That's the place to be,
instead of home.

1580
01:27:35,676 --> 01:27:37,885
And it was exactly
the opposite with Shahrukh...

1581
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:41,469
He got upset with sister-in-law
Gauri and walked out, saying...

1582
01:27:41,552 --> 01:27:44,427
No, no, no, I don't feel pain.

1583
01:27:45,052 --> 01:27:46,469
I'll never come back here again.

1584
01:27:47,302 --> 01:27:50,719
But I will whenever I miss Pari...

1585
01:27:51,677 --> 01:27:54,676
I'll never come back.

1586
01:27:55,719 --> 01:27:59,427
But I will whenever I miss Pari...

1587
01:27:59,676 --> 01:28:00,676
Whenever I will find myself alone...

1588
01:28:07,676 --> 01:28:08,802
Thank you.

1589
01:28:08,885 --> 01:28:13,844
"The hurt I got... still hurts."

1590
01:28:14,427 --> 01:28:18,469
"It will always hurt."

1591
01:28:19,696 --> 01:28:21,844
"You're mine..."

1592
01:28:22,135 --> 01:28:24,552
"And still are."

1593
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,094
Bala...

1594
01:28:29,155 --> 01:28:30,677
Are you thinking of jumping?

1595
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:35,552
I was waiting for you to come by...

1596
01:28:36,552 --> 01:28:38,135
You've brought me this far,
now you just need to push.

1597
01:28:38,344 --> 01:28:40,676
Stop bickering like a teenager?

1598
01:28:40,802 --> 01:28:42,676
What are you doing here?

1599
01:28:43,635 --> 01:28:45,552
I am feeling guilty for the other day...

1600
01:28:45,885 --> 01:28:47,427
...and I came to say sorry.

1601
01:28:47,552 --> 01:28:49,802
You came to say sorry...

1602
01:28:50,552 --> 01:28:51,676
Really?

1603
01:28:52,844 --> 01:28:54,552
Please apologize, ma'am.

1604
01:28:55,135 --> 01:28:56,469
Please...say it.

1605
01:29:01,676 --> 01:29:02,552
Sorry.

1606
01:29:02,861 --> 01:29:05,052
Apology not accepted! Get lost!

1607
01:29:16,676 --> 01:29:18,802
A daughter in law is like an open weapon.

1608
01:29:19,135 --> 01:29:20,597
She shouldn't stay out of
the house for so long.

1609
01:29:20,677 --> 01:29:22,302
It's been really long since she left.

1610
01:29:22,427 --> 01:29:23,552
When is she coming back?

1611
01:29:23,676 --> 01:29:25,552
What are you doing, son?

1612
01:29:26,344 --> 01:29:27,552
What is that form?

1613
01:29:27,677 --> 01:29:28,597
It's for hair transplant.

1614
01:29:28,677 --> 01:29:30,596
I've decided to go
for a hair transplant.

1615
01:29:30,676 --> 01:29:31,844
But you have diabetes.

1616
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:33,427
I know...I know all the risks.

1617
01:29:33,635 --> 01:29:34,802
But I have decided
to go under the knife.

1618
01:29:34,885 --> 01:29:37,135
If you've decided to put your head under
the knife, then where will you grow hair.

1619
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,427
- On your hand.
- I don't need your advice.

1620
01:29:39,676 --> 01:29:43,802
All I am trying to say is you don't
have to get into these stupid hassles.

1621
01:29:44,427 --> 01:29:47,639
That toupe on your head
is a much better solution.

1622
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:50,219
You're being a wise guy because
you still have hair on your head.

1623
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:51,552
I know all this seems
like a joke to you...

1624
01:29:51,676 --> 01:29:53,885
...but remember, I was your
age when I started to lose hair.

1625
01:29:54,219 --> 01:29:56,596
I knew it. I knew it, brother.

1626
01:29:56,676 --> 01:29:58,596
- Knew what?
- That you're jealous of me.

1627
01:29:58,676 --> 01:30:00,347
I...am jealous of you?

1628
01:30:00,427 --> 01:30:02,094
You're jealous of me, my hair.

1629
01:30:02,552 --> 01:30:04,135
Jealousy is not good
for health, brother. Don't forget.

1630
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:07,596
And stop staring at my
hair with your greedy eyes.

1631
01:30:07,676 --> 01:30:12,260
It's because of you I lost
four strands of hair yesterday.

1632
01:30:12,344 --> 01:30:14,094
I've kept them safe.
Take a look for yourself.

1633
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:17,596
And if I lose one more strand of hair,
then you've had it.

1634
01:30:17,676 --> 01:30:20,219
I'll show you...
What's wrong with you?

1635
01:30:20,302 --> 01:30:21,597
I swear if you...

1636
01:30:21,677 --> 01:30:23,052
Come here, son.

1637
01:30:23,135 --> 01:30:25,677
There is no escape from me.

1638
01:30:26,427 --> 01:30:28,344
I can't even eat my food peacefully.
- I'll tell you.

1639
01:30:28,469 --> 01:30:30,302
Break each other's head.

1640
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:32,677
Let him go. He's your brother.

1641
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:34,677
Finish this once for all.

1642
01:30:34,802 --> 01:30:36,552
Idiots

1643
01:30:38,885 --> 01:30:39,676
Stop!

1644
01:30:40,131 --> 01:30:41,427
Take a look at this.

1645
01:30:43,052 --> 01:30:43,885
What is it?

1646
01:30:48,635 --> 01:30:50,094
What is it?

1647
01:30:51,885 --> 01:30:52,719
What...

1648
01:30:58,971 --> 01:31:01,094
What is it?
Is someone going to tell me?

1649
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:14,344
She's charged you with fraud.

1650
01:31:15,052 --> 01:31:17,597
She claims that you cheated
her into this marriage...

1651
01:31:17,677 --> 01:31:20,219
...so this marriage should
be deemed null and void.

1652
01:31:20,676 --> 01:31:21,719
Null and void.

1653
01:31:22,302 --> 01:31:24,552
Plus she's also claimed
a million in damages.

1654
01:31:25,344 --> 01:31:26,677
You wanted to apologize,
didn't you?

1655
01:31:27,135 --> 01:31:28,469
Now defend my case.

1656
01:31:29,552 --> 01:31:31,885
You think you're some big-shot lawyer,
don't you?

1657
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:33,885
I don't think I am...
I know I am.

1658
01:31:34,302 --> 01:31:35,552
Then defend my case...

1659
01:31:35,676 --> 01:31:36,427
Do it.

1660
01:31:36,552 --> 01:31:38,135
I don't want to defend your case

1661
01:31:38,344 --> 01:31:40,469
You're a big pain in the neck.

1662
01:31:41,135 --> 01:31:43,052
I don't have an option.

1663
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,344
Because I cannot trust another lawyer.

1664
01:31:47,344 --> 01:31:48,094
Why?

1665
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:49,552
Because my baldness ...

1666
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:53,596
Because she left me for my baldness.

1667
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:54,596
If I tell some other lawyer,

1668
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,219
and the news will get
leaked all over the city.

1669
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:57,302
I'll be humiliated.

1670
01:31:57,552 --> 01:32:00,469
I can endure everything, but I
can't tolerate anyone laughing on me.

1671
01:32:01,676 --> 01:32:03,676
Please take my case... Please...

1672
01:32:09,635 --> 01:32:12,135
Look Balmukund, you have cheated her.

1673
01:32:13,052 --> 01:32:15,344
Why didn't you tell
her that you're bald?

1674
01:32:15,635 --> 01:32:17,719
I did...
In fact, I even texted her.

1675
01:32:18,552 --> 01:32:20,135
But it got sent to someone else.
Went to Babu Presswala

1676
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,677
Sheer case of misunderstanding.

1677
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:33,552
You sent the text to Babu...

1678
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,427
Life's already screwed me,
and you think its funny.

1679
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,676
Look, on a very serious note...

1680
01:32:40,676 --> 01:32:44,094
...you could've told her about
your situation at any point in time...

1681
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:45,635
I would...

1682
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:50,094
I would've have told her this fact in my
way if you hadn't messed up everything.

1683
01:32:50,344 --> 01:32:51,719
And I would've kept her happy forever.

1684
01:32:58,802 --> 01:33:00,302
Please take my case.

1685
01:33:13,072 --> 01:33:16,469
Often I wonder how joyful life would be..

1686
01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:18,885
... if could spend it relaxing
my head on your lap

1687
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,676
She sent me a notice.

1688
01:33:25,676 --> 01:33:27,427
Smile my friend. Smile...

1689
01:33:27,677 --> 01:33:28,802
When you laugh your sorrows away,

1690
01:33:28,885 --> 01:33:30,469
then joys will be worth the wait.

1691
01:33:30,552 --> 01:33:31,764
Destiny will be your slave,

1692
01:33:31,844 --> 01:33:34,676
and you'll be the
king of your destiny.

1693
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:37,219
No...

1694
01:33:38,094 --> 01:33:41,885
No isn't just a word,
but a complete sentence.

1695
01:33:42,795 --> 01:33:47,219
And starting today,
you won't meet Pari,

1696
01:33:47,427 --> 01:33:48,596
or think about her.

1697
01:33:48,676 --> 01:33:49,344
Yeah...

1698
01:33:49,676 --> 01:33:50,135
Yeah...

1699
01:33:50,425 --> 01:33:50,844
Yeah...

1700
01:33:53,469 --> 01:33:54,344
Yeah...

1701
01:33:55,052 --> 01:33:59,094
"What a pretty way
to reward my love..."

1702
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:00,597
Your love...

1703
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:04,385
"My own love robbed
me of my happiness."

1704
01:34:04,465 --> 01:34:06,596
Sonu Nigam. Sonu Nigam.

1705
01:34:06,676 --> 01:34:10,469
- Good singer.
- "My love's..."

1706
01:34:10,676 --> 01:34:11,676
Brother Bala.

1707
01:34:11,756 --> 01:34:13,055
What?

1708
01:34:13,135 --> 01:34:14,635
Your picture's on the paper.

1709
01:34:15,302 --> 01:34:15,885
My picture?

1710
01:34:16,094 --> 01:34:17,135
Yes...

1711
01:34:17,676 --> 01:34:18,677
There's one here too.

1712
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,427
This one...and this one...

1713
01:34:24,885 --> 01:34:29,094
Wife dumps husband
for his bald patch...

1714
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,676
Files a cheating case...

1715
01:34:41,094 --> 01:34:44,427
"News has come."

1716
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:47,719
"You won't be able
to save your honour."

1717
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:02,344
Now Bala had two hands...

1718
01:35:02,677 --> 01:35:06,635
And the population
of Kanpur was 4 million.

1719
01:35:07,135 --> 01:35:12,302
Poor guy couldn't stop his life
from going spiral...

1720
01:35:12,427 --> 01:35:14,844
...and his news going viral.

1721
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:17,596
He got dumped by his
wife and you think its funny.

1722
01:35:17,676 --> 01:35:19,885
You think it's funny, huh...
I won't cut your hair.

1723
01:35:20,302 --> 01:35:22,552
All the scams in the world
and they think this is funny.

1724
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:24,469
You used to hang out with him,
didn't you?

1725
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,260
Read it.

1726
01:35:27,135 --> 01:35:32,219
She has also filed a case in order to
get the marriage declared null and void.

1727
01:35:41,635 --> 01:35:44,802
Now how did this news get
to the newspapers...

1728
01:35:44,885 --> 01:35:47,094
...is what I don't know either.

1729
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:48,597
What is the poor guy going to do now?

1730
01:35:48,677 --> 01:35:49,552
Bala.

1731
01:35:49,676 --> 01:35:53,219
Bala, come out.
Come out. Come out.

1732
01:35:53,302 --> 01:35:53,802
What is it?

1733
01:35:53,885 --> 01:35:55,552
Where is our beloved leader?

1734
01:35:55,676 --> 01:35:57,052
He's not at home.
He's gone out.

1735
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:58,802
He must be visiting the guy...

1736
01:35:59,094 --> 01:36:01,469
...who grew hair on
his head with bull's semen.

1737
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:05,219
Come down if you have the guts.

1738
01:36:12,676 --> 01:36:14,596
"Dumped by his wife."

1739
01:36:14,676 --> 01:36:16,510
"He turned out to be bald."

1740
01:36:16,635 --> 01:36:18,344
"He turned out to be a liar."

1741
01:36:18,469 --> 01:36:20,052
"All his claims were false..."

1742
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:21,676
"...he had no hair on his head."

1743
01:36:22,135 --> 01:36:23,677
"Show your face, Bala..."

1744
01:36:23,802 --> 01:36:25,676
"...so we can turn your face black."

1745
01:36:30,802 --> 01:36:32,885
- Let me do it, brother Bala.
- I can do it. I can do it.

1746
01:36:33,676 --> 01:36:35,635
- Let me do it...
- I said I'll do it.

1747
01:36:39,363 --> 01:36:40,135
Get lost.

1748
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:09,260
Eat.

1749
01:37:29,676 --> 01:37:31,677
Aunty taught me a
lesson when I was a kid...

1750
01:37:32,052 --> 01:37:33,135
Listen carefully...

1751
01:37:33,676 --> 01:37:36,844
Why did you do it in the first place?
Why pine?

1752
01:37:37,552 --> 01:37:39,427
When you plant a tree of cactus,

1753
01:37:39,635 --> 01:37:40,802
how can you expect mangoes?

1754
01:37:40,885 --> 01:37:42,760
The saying goes
rubbing salt on wounds...

1755
01:37:42,844 --> 01:37:45,052
...but you rub every condiment you can.

1756
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:46,219
I am going.

1757
01:37:47,135 --> 01:37:48,676
The hearing is coming closer, Bala.

1758
01:37:49,094 --> 01:37:50,135
To hell with the case.

1759
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:51,844
I don't want to embarrass
myself in the court again.

1760
01:37:52,094 --> 01:37:52,844
Why?

1761
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,094
Because I have rotten luck.

1762
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:56,596
So you don't want to defend this case?

1763
01:37:56,676 --> 01:37:57,469
No...

1764
01:37:57,676 --> 01:37:58,260
Fine.

1765
01:37:59,094 --> 01:37:59,677
I don't care.

1766
01:38:00,885 --> 01:38:05,596
If you don't defend yourself, then it
will be proof that you cheated Pari.

1767
01:38:05,676 --> 01:38:08,552
But who's going to
marry you after that?

1768
01:38:08,676 --> 01:38:09,885
Have you ever thought of that?

1769
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:12,802
But anyway...

1770
01:38:13,676 --> 01:38:15,639
The entire state depends on God...

1771
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:17,676
...I am sure you can too.

1772
01:38:17,885 --> 01:38:21,676
I am already so depressed
and you're having fun as well.

1773
01:38:21,885 --> 01:38:24,344
Why do you always get so melodramatic?

1774
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,552
What's the big deal
if people found out?

1775
01:38:27,677 --> 01:38:28,552
You...

1776
01:38:29,094 --> 01:38:30,469
You will never understand

1777
01:38:35,677 --> 01:38:37,094
I won't understand...

1778
01:38:38,676 --> 01:38:40,596
You've been going through this
phase for only a couple of years...

1779
01:38:40,676 --> 01:38:42,427
...but I've faced this my entire life.

1780
01:38:42,676 --> 01:38:44,135
The complex about my looks...

1781
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:45,596
Comments on my skin tone...

1782
01:38:45,676 --> 01:38:48,676
Embarrassment...suffocation...
I've been through it all.

1783
01:38:50,094 --> 01:38:52,260
And you were among them too.

1784
01:38:58,219 --> 01:39:01,135
When a 10-year-old
girl is called dark...

1785
01:39:01,676 --> 01:39:06,427
...you won't understand the
mental trauma she goes through.

1786
01:39:10,885 --> 01:39:12,844
And you say I won't understand...

1787
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:15,510
Stupid.

1788
01:39:22,676 --> 01:39:23,676
Sorry.

1789
01:39:26,552 --> 01:39:27,885
I will defend this case.

1790
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:36,676
These stupid things are
not allowed in my office.

1791
01:39:37,676 --> 01:39:40,344
Sorry, ...forgive me, O warrior queen.
But this is my job.

1792
01:39:40,635 --> 01:39:41,552
I know...

1793
01:39:41,676 --> 01:39:45,219
You have a respectable job of
demoralizing girls with dark skin tone.

1794
01:39:45,469 --> 01:39:47,302
Where do you bring
this over-activism from?

1795
01:39:47,427 --> 01:39:48,844
Enough...

1796
01:39:49,052 --> 01:39:50,802
I am going to write
your statement today...

1797
01:39:51,219 --> 01:39:52,844
...so I'm entitled to ask
you a few personal questions.

1798
01:39:53,676 --> 01:39:56,677
And answer me correctly
without feeling embarrassed.

1799
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:57,844
I never lie.

1800
01:39:58,469 --> 01:40:01,094
I know how truth-loving
you really are.

1801
01:40:03,052 --> 01:40:03,885
Question no. 1

1802
01:40:04,969 --> 01:40:06,677
What happened between the two of you?

1803
01:40:09,219 --> 01:40:15,260
Well...love...proposal...
then marriage.

1804
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,427
Anything else...

1805
01:40:18,344 --> 01:40:19,052
Anything else?

1806
01:40:20,094 --> 01:40:21,052
Anything else...

1807
01:40:21,135 --> 01:40:22,052
What?

1808
01:40:22,135 --> 01:40:24,635
I am asking did you
ever have sex with her?

1809
01:40:26,635 --> 01:40:27,802
We didn't have sex...

1810
01:40:28,302 --> 01:40:31,802
I mean we had a little... Well...

1811
01:40:32,344 --> 01:40:33,676
How do I explain in detail?

1812
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:35,760
But why are you interested
in my love life?

1813
01:40:35,844 --> 01:40:38,094
Why would I be interested
in your love life...

1814
01:40:38,344 --> 01:40:39,676
Don't try to be over-smart.

1815
01:40:40,094 --> 01:40:42,844
I am asking because
her family can make a claim...

1816
01:40:43,052 --> 01:40:46,219
...that you married her only
for a physical relationship.

1817
01:40:47,552 --> 01:40:48,677
Pari can never do such a thing.

1818
01:40:49,094 --> 01:40:49,676
Why?

1819
01:40:50,052 --> 01:40:51,676
She loves me,
and she will come back to me.

1820
01:40:51,802 --> 01:40:52,676
How?

1821
01:40:54,676 --> 01:40:57,219
Let me show you.
She liked my video. See...

1822
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:01,885
"Your name's etched on my heart."

1823
01:41:02,552 --> 01:41:06,596
"Your name's etched on my heart."

1824
01:41:06,676 --> 01:41:09,094
"Filled with your love and care."

1825
01:41:09,219 --> 01:41:11,260
"Your name's etched on my heart."

1826
01:41:11,344 --> 01:41:12,635
What on earth is this?

1827
01:41:14,676 --> 01:41:16,347
What on earth is this?

1828
01:41:16,427 --> 01:41:17,676
My true feeling.

1829
01:41:20,344 --> 01:41:24,427
"Your name's etched on my heart."

1830
01:41:24,676 --> 01:41:26,552
The papers are here, sign them.

1831
01:41:31,344 --> 01:41:34,635
Look dear,
think before signing these papers.

1832
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,469
Is this necessary?

1833
01:41:36,676 --> 01:41:38,469
Leaving your husband
over such a trivial thing.

1834
01:41:38,552 --> 01:41:39,552
Trivial...

1835
01:41:39,676 --> 01:41:41,596
He has cheated us.

1836
01:41:41,676 --> 01:41:43,219
I am talking to her.

1837
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,552
Pari...
Look at me.

1838
01:41:46,676 --> 01:41:48,552
- Put that down.
- Return my phone.

1839
01:41:48,676 --> 01:41:50,135
This thing's ruined your life.

1840
01:41:50,676 --> 01:41:52,719
I've already said that
I don't want to live with him.

1841
01:41:53,135 --> 01:41:55,052
And I don't want any money either.

1842
01:41:56,135 --> 01:41:57,052
Now return my phone.

1843
01:42:00,802 --> 01:42:04,760
So...did you spend on anything
else at the wedding?

1844
01:42:04,844 --> 01:42:06,635
Isn't this enough?

1845
01:42:07,635 --> 01:42:08,596
Why would it matter to me?

1846
01:42:08,676 --> 01:42:10,469
He's your son.
You can spend as much as you like...

1847
01:42:10,552 --> 01:42:12,596
No, we didn't spend on anything else.

1848
01:42:12,676 --> 01:42:16,552
Except for little things like booze...

1849
01:42:16,676 --> 01:42:17,676
Where is Bala?

1850
01:42:18,135 --> 01:42:18,597
Why?

1851
01:42:18,677 --> 01:42:19,719
What do you want from him now?

1852
01:42:20,469 --> 01:42:23,427
I am his Lawyer.
I've got to do my job.

1853
01:42:23,676 --> 01:42:25,344
She isn't complaining either.

1854
01:42:26,469 --> 01:42:27,719
He's upstairs. Go on.

1855
01:42:30,177 --> 01:42:31,969
Your room's nicely decorated.

1856
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,927
You've still kept all the photos.

1857
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:49,469
Aunty says there's one moment
in our life that's very close to us...

1858
01:42:49,969 --> 01:42:51,676
...and we want to live it
over and over again.

1859
01:42:52,219 --> 01:42:55,594
This is...that part of your life,
isn't it?

1860
01:42:56,802 --> 01:42:57,719
Yes.

1861
01:43:03,471 --> 01:43:04,927
Are you coming to the school reunion?

1862
01:43:05,802 --> 01:43:06,596
No...

1863
01:43:06,676 --> 01:43:07,635
Why?

1864
01:43:09,676 --> 01:43:10,802
I feel bored.

1865
01:43:12,676 --> 01:43:13,635
Bored...

1866
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:18,676
Bored or embarrassed.

1867
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:20,177
Why would I be embarrassed?

1868
01:43:20,469 --> 01:43:22,719
You were the star of our school.

1869
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:25,552
And now your image's shattered.

1870
01:43:28,469 --> 01:43:29,676
Enough of this nonsense...

1871
01:43:30,676 --> 01:43:31,676
Let's discuss the case.

1872
01:43:31,969 --> 01:43:35,676
If you don't come,
then I won't defend your case.

1873
01:43:36,052 --> 01:43:36,969
Why?

1874
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:40,635
Come on, you'll have fun.

1875
01:43:41,552 --> 01:43:43,344
And don't worry...

1876
01:43:43,552 --> 01:43:46,052
No one cares about
your personal problems.

1877
01:43:47,094 --> 01:43:48,219
Tell me one thing...

1878
01:43:48,469 --> 01:43:50,676
who looks the same
throughout his life...

1879
01:43:53,552 --> 01:43:55,594
Why don't you accept yourself?

1880
01:43:56,219 --> 01:43:58,676
You look good the way you are.

1881
01:44:04,052 --> 01:44:06,135
I am going to take a case of this KESA

1882
01:44:06,552 --> 01:44:08,676
It's been more than four hours
and still no sign of electricity.

1883
01:44:08,969 --> 01:44:11,052
I am going to file a PIL against them.

1884
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,135
Wait and watch.

1885
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:15,344
And unfortunately,

1886
01:44:15,594 --> 01:44:17,469
I got the name Kubja.

1887
01:44:17,802 --> 01:44:19,469
Everyone shunned me.

1888
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,719
Come Kubja, let me make you beautiful.

1889
01:44:33,135 --> 01:44:35,594
Why did Krishna have
to make Kubja beautiful?

1890
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,676
Someone could have liked
her the way she was.

1891
01:44:39,385 --> 01:44:40,469
Nonsense...

1892
01:44:41,385 --> 01:44:45,344
When God has set the wrong precedent,
why blame humans.

1893
01:44:48,885 --> 01:44:50,177
I knew it...

1894
01:44:50,552 --> 01:44:52,927
...someday you will wage war on God.

1895
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:55,676
You will not understand.

1896
01:44:56,302 --> 01:44:57,135
Come on.

1897
01:45:07,715 --> 01:45:09,802
"As my heart..."

1898
01:45:10,469 --> 01:45:12,635
"...struck a bell."

1899
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:17,635
"All those memories came back to me."

1900
01:45:18,552 --> 01:45:20,635
"All those tales..."

1901
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:23,385
"...which I want to keep..."

1902
01:45:23,552 --> 01:45:28,385
"...etched in my memory forever."

1903
01:45:29,219 --> 01:45:31,385
"As you walk me..."

1904
01:45:31,469 --> 01:45:33,676
"...down that same lane."

1905
01:45:34,219 --> 01:45:38,969
"I want to stay for a while."

1906
01:45:39,427 --> 01:45:43,635
"I am waiting, o Life."

1907
01:45:44,676 --> 01:45:49,177
"Hold my hand and guide me."

1908
01:45:54,469 --> 01:45:55,676
- Hi, Rishab.
- Great...

1909
01:45:58,676 --> 01:46:00,010
Sir, recognize me.

1910
01:46:00,676 --> 01:46:01,469
Bala.

1911
01:46:02,594 --> 01:46:03,469
Bala.

1912
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,010
How are you, son?

1913
01:46:05,676 --> 01:46:06,676
Doing great, sir.

1914
01:46:07,676 --> 01:46:09,676
Actually,
I wanted to apologize to you.

1915
01:46:10,469 --> 01:46:14,469
Remember, someone drew a sketch of you
on this blackboard and called you baldy...

1916
01:46:14,594 --> 01:46:15,927
...and humiliated you.

1917
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,927
That was me, sir.

1918
01:46:20,552 --> 01:46:22,676
I knew it was you.

1919
01:46:23,676 --> 01:46:24,469
See...

1920
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,927
I made this myself for you guys.

1921
01:46:28,135 --> 01:46:28,760
Sir.

1922
01:46:31,052 --> 01:46:33,635
Come on, let's take a picture.
Everyone sit in your place.

1923
01:46:35,177 --> 01:46:37,385
"I was a little disillusioned."

1924
01:46:37,469 --> 01:46:39,927
"And also a little cheeky."

1925
01:46:40,135 --> 01:46:44,719
"Every mischief followed by another."

1926
01:46:45,344 --> 01:46:47,802
"All those whom I troubled."

1927
01:46:47,969 --> 01:46:50,635
"Were right before me."

1928
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:55,676
"Those friends were my real treasures."

1929
01:46:56,552 --> 01:46:58,552
"I want to face them..."

1930
01:46:58,676 --> 01:47:01,344
"...and take a good eyeful."

1931
01:47:01,427 --> 01:47:06,385
"The moments that I lived back then."

1932
01:47:06,676 --> 01:47:10,676
"Even if you trouble me..."

1933
01:47:11,969 --> 01:47:15,927
"I forgive you, O life."

1934
01:47:17,302 --> 01:47:21,344
"Here I go again, O life..."

1935
01:47:22,676 --> 01:47:26,676
"... To be happy again."

1936
01:47:41,094 --> 01:47:46,177
According to the Hindu Marriage Act,
1955 Marriage is a sacrament.

1937
01:47:46,676 --> 01:47:49,552
Marriage is a holy bond.
It's a belief.

1938
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:53,385
How can a marriage based
on the foundation of a lie...

1939
01:47:53,469 --> 01:47:56,344
...be considered as
a marriage in any aspect.

1940
01:47:56,676 --> 01:47:58,676
It's just fraud.

1941
01:47:59,177 --> 01:48:04,596
Is it fair to annul a marriage
on the grounds of baldness?

1942
01:48:04,676 --> 01:48:08,219
Let Pari Mishra decide
whether it's fair or not.

1943
01:48:08,676 --> 01:48:09,927
She feels cheated.

1944
01:48:10,344 --> 01:48:11,135
Okay then...

1945
01:48:12,135 --> 01:48:14,135
I want to ask
Pari Mishra some questions.

1946
01:48:14,219 --> 01:48:15,010
Go ahead.

1947
01:48:15,676 --> 01:48:20,676
Did you marry Balmukund only
for his hair?

1948
01:48:23,302 --> 01:48:24,385
No.

1949
01:48:24,676 --> 01:48:25,676
Then why did you marry him?

1950
01:48:26,469 --> 01:48:27,969
He is charming...

1951
01:48:28,469 --> 01:48:29,469
Was...

1952
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,427
He was a good comic.

1953
01:48:33,927 --> 01:48:35,760
He had a good sense of humor.

1954
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:39,802
You wanted to pursue
a career in modelling.

1955
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:40,760
Right?

1956
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:41,802
Yes.

1957
01:48:42,802 --> 01:48:44,635
What was Balmukund's stand?

1958
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:47,760
He said he'll support me in my career.

1959
01:48:48,802 --> 01:48:55,260
Did he ever abuse, misbehave,
or resort to any sort of violence,

1960
01:48:55,385 --> 01:48:57,260
physical or verbal, with you?

1961
01:48:57,802 --> 01:48:58,676
Never.

1962
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:00,135
You see, ma'am.

1963
01:49:00,469 --> 01:49:03,596
Pari married Balmukund
for his good heart and decent behavior

1964
01:49:03,676 --> 01:49:04,927
and not his hair.

1965
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:07,427
Fine... agreed.
Agreed... Agreed...

1966
01:49:07,552 --> 01:49:09,177
Let's agree that he
was a very nice person.

1967
01:49:09,385 --> 01:49:11,427
But if he was such a nice person...

1968
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:14,676
...then he could've told her
about this mop on the head.

1969
01:49:14,969 --> 01:49:16,383
Why didn't he?

1970
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:21,969
Balmukund, please take off
the patch you're wearing on your head.

1971
01:49:24,969 --> 01:49:26,469
Take it off.

1972
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,385
I said take it off.

1973
01:49:32,552 --> 01:49:37,139
Please take it off so we can bring
the real matter of this case in light.

1974
01:49:37,219 --> 01:49:38,676
We never agreed on this.

1975
01:49:41,246 --> 01:49:44,760
Just do as I say...take it off.

1976
01:49:45,676 --> 01:49:48,385
Remove it, trust me.. remove it.

1977
01:49:56,010 --> 01:49:56,969
Stop.

1978
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,802
Stop.

1979
01:50:00,676 --> 01:50:01,676
It's okay.

1980
01:50:03,676 --> 01:50:05,052
Did you notice his hesitation?

1981
01:50:05,385 --> 01:50:07,427
The embarrassment, the humiliation...

1982
01:50:07,552 --> 01:50:10,177
...which every stout, scrawny,
tall, short, bald,

1983
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:13,427
and dark-skinned person
goes through every day.

1984
01:50:14,052 --> 01:50:16,719
Because they are made
to realize this every day.

1985
01:50:17,094 --> 01:50:21,639
Balmukund hid this fact
from Pari for this embarrassment.

1986
01:50:21,719 --> 01:50:24,427
And not his intentions to cheat Pari.

1987
01:50:24,552 --> 01:50:27,969
I think you've taken
this matter rather personally.

1988
01:50:28,469 --> 01:50:29,469
What do you mean?

1989
01:50:29,676 --> 01:50:31,802
What do you mean by
I've taken this personally?

1990
01:50:32,052 --> 01:50:33,676
What is he trying to imply, ma'am?

1991
01:50:33,969 --> 01:50:37,135
Is he trying to say that
I took this case personally

1992
01:50:37,344 --> 01:50:38,676
because I am dark-skinned?

1993
01:50:38,802 --> 01:50:40,385
Is this what this man is saying?

1994
01:50:40,469 --> 01:50:41,969
Please, I never said such a thing.

1995
01:50:42,052 --> 01:50:44,885
That's exactly what you
said and it is not acceptable.

1996
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:48,427
This is a sexist and a racist
remark in the court of law.

1997
01:50:48,552 --> 01:50:48,889
Calm down.

1998
01:50:48,969 --> 01:50:52,010
This is an insult of a female
lawyer and this will not be tolerated.

1999
01:50:52,135 --> 01:50:53,385
Please tell this man to apologize.

2000
01:50:53,469 --> 01:50:55,010
Mr. Raina, what is this...

2001
01:50:55,135 --> 01:50:58,469
Okay, sorry...sorry, I apologize.

2002
01:50:58,635 --> 01:51:00,469
It's not about you or me.

2003
01:51:00,676 --> 01:51:05,144
Nor is this case about
body shaming or embarrassment.

2004
01:51:05,224 --> 01:51:07,596
This case is about a woman's rights.

2005
01:51:07,676 --> 01:51:11,427
A woman will be seeing this
face for the rest of her life...

2006
01:51:11,507 --> 01:51:15,469
...so doesn't she have the
right to decide how he should look.

2007
01:51:17,135 --> 01:51:22,469
If Balmukund hid the fact of
his baldness and married Pari Mishra...

2008
01:51:22,594 --> 01:51:23,802
...then our Constitution...

2009
01:51:23,882 --> 01:51:27,676
...gives Pari Mishra the right
to refuse to accept this marriage.

2010
01:51:36,552 --> 01:51:37,676
Look at him.

2011
01:51:38,135 --> 01:51:39,635
Balmukund Shukla.

2012
01:51:40,177 --> 01:51:41,552
He has many qualities.

2013
01:51:42,177 --> 01:51:43,969
Like Pari just told us.

2014
01:51:44,427 --> 01:51:49,385
He is sensitive, he's emotional, he's
caring, he's decent, he's a nice man.

2015
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:53,427
But if you can't see
his goodness and qualities...

2016
01:51:53,552 --> 01:51:58,427
...and just a patch of hair, then you
need a doctor and not a lawyer.

2017
01:51:59,469 --> 01:52:02,385
Wow...what a statement.

2018
01:52:02,469 --> 01:52:03,219
Order. Order.

2019
01:52:03,344 --> 01:52:04,344
Madam...

2020
01:52:04,635 --> 01:52:06,344
I won't tolerate gimmicky here.

2021
01:52:07,924 --> 01:52:12,635
Your honour, I want to
ask Pari Mishra's last remark.

2022
01:52:15,344 --> 01:52:22,469
I saw a mirror in Bala's
bathroom which was half-covered.

2023
01:52:27,885 --> 01:52:33,344
So when he can't stand
watching his own bald head...

2024
01:52:34,219 --> 01:52:38,427
...then how does he expect me to
do the same for the rest of my life.

2025
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,427
Is it fair?

2026
01:52:52,469 --> 01:52:53,719
- Ma'am...
- It is not fair.

2027
01:52:54,676 --> 01:52:55,469
Bala...

2028
01:52:55,594 --> 01:52:57,427
It's not fair, Latika.
Not fair at all.

2029
01:52:59,385 --> 01:53:00,676
I should have told her.

2030
01:53:01,635 --> 01:53:02,552
And not before the wedding...

2031
01:53:02,635 --> 01:53:05,052
...in fact, I should have told her
when we fell in love.

2032
01:53:06,802 --> 01:53:08,676
But I couldn't say it.

2033
01:53:10,676 --> 01:53:12,135
I could never muster the courage.

2034
01:53:14,635 --> 01:53:16,177
I did make a mistake.

2035
01:53:21,927 --> 01:53:23,552
Forgive me.

2036
01:53:26,344 --> 01:53:28,676
Pari, if you don't
accept this marriage, then...

2037
01:53:30,969 --> 01:53:34,719
...I request you to annul it.

2038
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:36,596
Bala, why...

2039
01:53:36,676 --> 01:53:39,344
I can't force her to love me.

2040
01:53:43,719 --> 01:53:47,676
The court has heard the arguments
from both the parties...

2041
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:55,010
...and respects Pari Mishra's personal
opinion and annuls this marriage.

2042
01:53:55,969 --> 01:53:58,676
This marriage shall
be considered null and void.

2043
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:04,177
We've won the case.
Time to celebrate.

2044
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:06,469
- Congratulations, sir.
- Pari...

2045
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:17,969
I want to apologize.

2046
01:54:21,552 --> 01:54:23,219
All the best for your future.

2047
01:54:25,469 --> 01:54:29,135
And this time,
find someone with that long pompa...

2048
01:54:29,474 --> 01:54:30,552
Long Pompadour

2049
01:54:30,676 --> 01:54:31,344
Yes...

2050
01:54:32,344 --> 01:54:34,427
...find someone with
that kind of hairstyle.

2051
01:54:35,676 --> 01:54:38,052
And this time make
sure by pulling his hair.

2052
01:54:46,676 --> 01:54:47,676
Okay...

2053
01:54:49,177 --> 01:54:50,177
Bye.

2054
01:54:56,676 --> 01:54:58,385
What are we selling?

2055
01:54:58,927 --> 01:54:59,927
Tell me...

2056
01:55:00,552 --> 01:55:01,552
Rahul.

2057
01:55:02,177 --> 01:55:04,010
Bala, you tell us.

2058
01:55:05,676 --> 01:55:06,552
Fairness cream.

2059
01:55:06,676 --> 01:55:07,676
No.

2060
01:55:09,676 --> 01:55:12,760
We're selling water
cooler in the desert.

2061
01:55:13,385 --> 01:55:15,385
Heater on the Himalaya.

2062
01:55:15,552 --> 01:55:17,427
Booze in Bihar.

2063
01:55:17,552 --> 01:55:19,219
Fresh air in Delhi.

2064
01:55:19,469 --> 01:55:21,596
We're selling beauty
to this ugly country.

2065
01:55:21,676 --> 01:55:23,010
For only 15 rupees.

2066
01:55:23,135 --> 01:55:24,135
15 rupees?

2067
01:55:24,344 --> 01:55:26,385
Even lemonade is more expensive.

2068
01:55:26,469 --> 01:55:27,552
And we're selling beauty at this rate.

2069
01:55:27,635 --> 01:55:28,802
What else does one want?

2070
01:55:30,219 --> 01:55:31,969
So my brave soldiers of beauty...

2071
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:34,469
Go now and make all the dark

2072
01:55:34,676 --> 01:55:38,010
and wheatish tone females
in this state realize their ugliness.

2073
01:55:38,135 --> 01:55:40,219
Go... Get under their skin.

2074
01:55:40,427 --> 01:55:42,344
"Give me more sale..."

2075
01:55:42,427 --> 01:55:43,676
"Stick it. Stick it. "

2076
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:46,010
"Give me more sale..."

2077
01:55:46,135 --> 01:55:47,596
"Stick it. Stick it. "

2078
01:55:47,676 --> 01:55:49,010
"Give me more sale..."

2079
01:55:49,135 --> 01:55:50,596
"Stick it. Stick it. "

2080
01:55:50,676 --> 01:55:51,552
Go and stick it then.

2081
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:54,927
Fair. Fair. Fair.

2082
01:55:55,302 --> 01:55:58,424
Meaning... who is fair is beautiful.

2083
01:55:58,802 --> 01:56:02,677
Caste, education, doesn't matter.

2084
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:06,676
Except for one thing.
Fair girls only.

2085
01:56:06,927 --> 01:56:08,302
This is an ideology of society.

2086
01:56:08,635 --> 01:56:09,802
You cannot change this ideology,

2087
01:56:09,927 --> 01:56:11,719
but you can change
the colour of your skin.

2088
01:56:11,885 --> 01:56:13,760
Buy Pretty You!

2089
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:24,635
Bala...

2090
01:56:33,219 --> 01:56:35,676
Get fairer skin in 5 weeks.

2091
01:56:49,719 --> 01:56:50,927
Go on...

2092
01:56:51,676 --> 01:56:53,927
You cannot change this ideology,

2093
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:56,344
but you can change
the colour of your skin.

2094
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:10,344
But why change it?

2095
01:57:18,594 --> 01:57:19,635
Why change it?

2096
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:23,552
Why change ourselves?

2097
01:57:23,635 --> 01:57:24,676
Why not?

2098
01:57:24,927 --> 01:57:27,594
Exactly, why change ourselves?

2099
01:58:21,677 --> 01:58:23,635
Why change?

2100
01:58:24,635 --> 01:58:26,927
Why change ourselves?

2101
01:58:29,177 --> 01:58:30,676
We won't change.

2102
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:37,676
Sir why do we need to change?

2103
01:58:40,510 --> 01:58:41,427
What did you do?

2104
01:58:41,552 --> 01:58:44,219
You said stick it, stick it.
So I stuck it, sir.

2105
01:58:50,969 --> 01:58:52,676
Proud of you, brother Bala.

2106
01:58:53,635 --> 01:58:54,677
Hold this. See you later.

2107
01:59:01,552 --> 01:59:04,885
So finally Bala renounced me...

2108
01:59:05,385 --> 01:59:08,594
...like Gautam Buddha renounced the world.

2109
01:59:17,677 --> 01:59:18,719
Bala...

2110
01:59:18,802 --> 01:59:20,385
Let it be.

2111
01:59:28,219 --> 01:59:31,676
Vihaan's been selected
for Ranji Trophy.

2112
01:59:41,177 --> 01:59:43,302
Ranji huh, bro...

2113
01:59:44,594 --> 01:59:46,302
You'll play for the country someday.

2114
01:59:48,802 --> 01:59:50,010
Let it roll.

2115
02:00:21,427 --> 02:00:25,639
It's an auspicious date, you know...

2116
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:27,010
This is really good.

2117
02:00:27,177 --> 02:00:30,676
We'll get these two
married on that date.

2118
02:00:35,683 --> 02:00:36,676
Who are you?

2119
02:00:37,676 --> 02:00:38,722
Bala.

2120
02:00:38,802 --> 02:00:39,885
What have you done?

2121
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:43,596
We're getting Latika
and Rohan engaged.

2122
02:00:43,676 --> 02:00:44,760
Good, you're here.

2123
02:00:45,635 --> 02:00:48,427
This is Bala.
He lives in the same neighborhood.

2124
02:00:48,552 --> 02:00:49,760
Sit, son.

2125
02:00:49,969 --> 02:00:51,302
Come come sit.

2126
02:01:15,969 --> 02:01:19,969
You never told me that Rohan
and you were having an affair.

2127
02:01:20,594 --> 02:01:22,219
Your marriage was on
the verge of breaking...

2128
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:25,676
...so I didn't think
it was right to tell you.

2129
02:01:27,635 --> 02:01:28,719
It seemed awkward.

2130
02:01:29,885 --> 02:01:31,676
But what are you doing here?

2131
02:01:32,676 --> 02:01:34,676
You know what I am doing here.

2132
02:01:36,302 --> 02:01:37,676
I've come to propose.

2133
02:01:39,219 --> 02:01:40,010
Yes...

2134
02:01:40,219 --> 02:01:43,510
I couldn't muster the courage
because of my fake hair and the job

2135
02:01:43,594 --> 02:01:44,676
But now I've quit.

2136
02:01:45,344 --> 02:01:47,510
And finally got the
confidence to propose to you.

2137
02:01:52,552 --> 02:01:53,676
Please reconsider.

2138
02:01:54,344 --> 02:01:55,510
Seriously, Bala.

2139
02:01:56,094 --> 02:01:56,760
Get up.

2140
02:01:58,385 --> 02:01:59,885
What is this? A film?

2141
02:02:00,510 --> 02:02:03,552
Did you really think you would come down
here and propose to me on my engagement...

2142
02:02:03,635 --> 02:02:05,635
...and I'll go with you.

2143
02:02:09,302 --> 02:02:10,676
He loves me.

2144
02:02:11,052 --> 02:02:13,639
Even I have started loving you.

2145
02:02:13,719 --> 02:02:16,344
Bala, I am your rebound
and not your love.

2146
02:02:16,424 --> 02:02:17,510
Please understand.

2147
02:02:18,676 --> 02:02:20,676
You never had feelings for me.

2148
02:02:21,676 --> 02:02:22,677
Maybe I did...

2149
02:02:24,222 --> 02:02:25,927
but now I have those feelings for Rohan.

2150
02:02:29,122 --> 02:02:31,510
So there's no chance
for a dramatic climax.

2151
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:33,676
Not even this much?

2152
02:02:34,677 --> 02:02:35,597
Not even this much...

2153
02:02:35,677 --> 02:02:36,885
S*** man.

2154
02:02:46,510 --> 02:02:50,260
"Trouble me all you want."

2155
02:02:51,042 --> 02:02:55,427
"But I forgive you."

2156
02:02:56,676 --> 02:03:00,676
"Here I go again..."

2157
02:03:01,676 --> 02:03:05,596
"To be happy again."

2158
02:03:05,676 --> 02:03:07,552
This look suits you.

2159
02:03:08,182 --> 02:03:09,510
Looking nice.

2160
02:03:10,676 --> 02:03:11,510
Thank you.

2161
02:03:14,885 --> 02:03:15,719
I mean it.

2162
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:20,676
For showing me the mirror.

2163
02:03:21,802 --> 02:03:24,676
Because the mirror
in my room is half covered.

2164
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:27,344
I could never see myself.

2165
02:03:31,802 --> 02:03:32,802
But now I have.

2166
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:38,094
That's a good thing.

2167
02:03:49,394 --> 02:03:52,010
Are you going to make
us laugh today or not, Bala?

2168
02:03:54,635 --> 02:03:59,594
Friends, I didn't come here to mimic
Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, or Bachchan sir.

2169
02:04:00,899 --> 02:04:02,606
I am someone else today.

2170
02:04:03,107 --> 02:04:05,274
The one on this mic is Bala...

2171
02:04:06,315 --> 02:04:08,482
Because you've seen Bala in this hair.

2172
02:04:10,131 --> 02:04:12,606
So you'll ask if this is Bala,
then who am I?

2173
02:04:13,149 --> 02:04:14,606
So I am Bal (Hair).

2174
02:04:17,232 --> 02:04:20,606
Doesn't it look like the Clean
India Campaign started from here?

2175
02:04:24,232 --> 02:04:27,440
Rupan...what's so funny?

2176
02:04:28,565 --> 02:04:29,982
Look at him.

2177
02:04:30,107 --> 02:04:31,690
If anything is under more
pressure than Virat Kohli,

2178
02:04:31,982 --> 02:04:33,606
then that's his shirt's button.

2179
02:04:34,606 --> 02:04:36,315
I bumped into him in
the market the other day.

2180
02:04:36,482 --> 02:04:37,526
He was wearing his wife's slippers.

2181
02:04:37,606 --> 02:04:39,149
I said, how did this happen?

2182
02:04:39,565 --> 02:04:42,065
He said I can't see what I am
wearing on the other side of my stomach...

2183
02:04:45,190 --> 02:04:47,399
And that's Nandkishore aka Nandu.

2184
02:04:47,606 --> 02:04:49,399
Kanpur's black panther.

2185
02:04:50,107 --> 02:04:52,982
If you throw an ice cube at him,
it will turn into cola.

2186
02:04:54,190 --> 02:04:56,274
Many years ago Nandu went to Mumbai...

2187
02:04:56,357 --> 02:04:59,107
...and the place where he
lived is known as Andheri now.

2188
02:05:00,649 --> 02:05:02,107
And that's Jaggi...

2189
02:05:02,606 --> 02:05:04,482
Raise your hands,
we can hardly see you.

2190
02:05:05,315 --> 02:05:07,606
He's so short,
that he's never seen an adult film.

2191
02:05:09,274 --> 02:05:13,565
The guys at the movies drive him
away saying this film isn't for kids.

2192
02:05:16,565 --> 02:05:19,982
Just like he's fat,
he's dark, he's short...

2193
02:05:23,565 --> 02:05:25,315
Similarly, Bala is bald.

2194
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:33,774
Bala lost his hair before
he could lose his virginity.

2195
02:05:36,565 --> 02:05:41,606
Bala is so bald that people sometimes
mistake his bald patch for the full moon.

2196
02:05:43,745 --> 02:05:45,690
Then I realized that
your lost love can come back,

2197
02:05:45,774 --> 02:05:47,524
even the government can come back...

2198
02:05:47,606 --> 02:05:50,149
...but hair once gone
can never come back.

2199
02:05:54,399 --> 02:05:55,565
Go ahead, laugh...

2200
02:05:56,649 --> 02:05:59,606
It's necessary to laugh at this fat,
scrawny, short people...

2201
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:01,569
...because our tradition says so.

2202
02:06:01,649 --> 02:06:03,065
So go ahead and laugh.

2203
02:06:06,982 --> 02:06:08,565
Because I won't feel offended anymore.

2204
02:06:11,606 --> 02:06:13,149
Because I am going to laugh with you.

2205
02:06:15,524 --> 02:06:17,524
I won't try to change myself.

2206
02:06:18,774 --> 02:06:21,899
Why change?
Why change ourselves?

2207
02:06:24,065 --> 02:06:26,774
Whether you accept me or not,
but I've accepted the way I am.

2208
02:06:37,606 --> 02:06:40,274
Back in school, I did a play where

2209
02:06:40,357 --> 02:06:43,565
Lord Krishna turns ugly
Kubja into someone beautiful

2210
02:06:45,606 --> 02:06:47,690
But today I finally understood that story.

2211
02:06:50,065 --> 02:06:52,107
Krishna didn't make Kubja beautiful...

2212
02:06:52,190 --> 02:06:54,899
In fact, he only made
her realize her beauty.

2213
02:06:57,606 --> 02:06:59,315
And the day you realize
that you'll be the

2214
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:01,606
most beautiful person in the world.

2215
02:07:03,482 --> 02:07:05,732
Whether you're fat, scrawny, short,
bald, or whatever you look like.

2216
02:07:05,857 --> 02:07:08,857
If you love yourself,
the world will love you.

2217
02:07:09,190 --> 02:07:11,606
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

2218
02:07:15,107 --> 02:07:17,606
Come fall in love...

2219
02:07:19,606 --> 02:07:20,526
with yourself.

2220
02:07:20,606 --> 02:07:24,399
"Trouble me all you want."

2221
02:07:25,606 --> 02:07:29,565
"I forgive all your mistakes, O Life."

2222
02:07:30,606 --> 02:07:34,857
"Take me in your arms, o Life."

2223
02:07:35,606 --> 02:07:39,690
"Take me in your arms, o Life."

2224
02:08:25,690 --> 02:08:28,524
"You just wanna."

2225
02:08:36,149 --> 02:08:36,940
"Listen..."

2226
02:08:37,065 --> 02:08:39,526
"I am a little crazy, do what I think."

2227
02:08:39,606 --> 02:08:41,732
"Play a song that's funky."

2228
02:08:41,857 --> 02:08:44,065
"Not the heart, nor the wealth."

2229
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:46,606
"This is about your body."

2230
02:08:46,899 --> 02:08:51,526
"I go crazy when you're in front of me."

2231
02:08:51,606 --> 02:08:55,774
"You're not tall, dark, or handsome,
still you're in my heart."

2232
02:08:56,107 --> 02:09:00,524
"Your heart's driving me out of control."

2233
02:09:00,606 --> 02:09:04,526
"I like the way you are."

2234
02:09:04,606 --> 02:09:07,274
"I just wanna..."

2235
02:09:07,357 --> 02:09:09,524
"Feel your body."

2236
02:09:09,606 --> 02:09:11,274
"Touch my body."

2237
02:09:11,357 --> 02:09:13,482
"Don't be shy my honey."

2238
02:09:14,065 --> 02:09:15,606
"Touch my body."

2239
02:09:15,690 --> 02:09:17,569
"I wanna feel your body."

2240
02:09:17,649 --> 02:09:20,149
"Touch my body."

2241
02:09:20,399 --> 02:09:22,315
"Don't be shy my honey."

2242
02:09:22,399 --> 02:09:24,649
"Touch my body."

2243
02:09:25,565 --> 02:09:27,190
"Fly my honey..."

2244
02:09:27,315 --> 02:09:29,482
"Don't be shy my honey."

2245
02:09:29,565 --> 02:09:31,526
"Fly my honey..."

2246
02:09:31,606 --> 02:09:34,065
"Don't be shy my honey."

2247
02:09:42,565 --> 02:09:43,357
"Listen..."

2248
02:09:43,482 --> 02:09:45,732
"I am a little crazy, do what I think."

2249
02:09:45,857 --> 02:09:48,149
"Play a song that's funky."

2250
02:09:48,274 --> 02:09:50,482
"Not the heart, nor the wealth."

2251
02:09:50,572 --> 02:09:53,739
"This is about your body."

2252
02:09:54,606 --> 02:09:58,774
"You speak from your eyes."

2253
02:09:59,149 --> 02:10:03,606
"You try to be naughty with me."

2254
02:10:03,732 --> 02:10:08,107
"I get restless when I don't see you."

2255
02:10:08,399 --> 02:10:12,606
"I never get tired of looking at you."

2256
02:10:12,690 --> 02:10:18,149
"The night's getting naughty..."

2257
02:10:19,649 --> 02:10:21,899
"Don't be shy my honey."

2258
02:10:24,357 --> 02:10:26,526
"I wanna feel your body."

2259
02:10:26,606 --> 02:10:28,649
"Touch my body."

2260
02:10:28,857 --> 02:10:31,149
"Don't be shy my honey."

2261
02:10:31,274 --> 02:10:33,399
"Touch my body."

2262
02:10:33,524 --> 02:10:35,569
"I wanna feel your body."

2263
02:10:35,649 --> 02:10:37,732
"Touch my body."

2264
02:10:37,857 --> 02:10:40,274
"Don't be shy my honey."

2265
02:10:40,357 --> 02:10:42,649
"Touch my body."

2266
02:10:42,899 --> 02:10:44,526
"Fly my honey..."

2267
02:10:44,606 --> 02:10:46,899
"Don't be shy my honey."

2268
02:10:47,065 --> 02:10:49,274
"Fly my honey..."

2269
02:10:49,357 --> 02:10:51,606
"Don't be shy my honey."

2270
02:11:27,232 --> 02:11:29,565
"As my heart..."

2271
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:31,774
"...struck a bell."

2272
02:11:32,357 --> 02:11:36,899
"All those memories came back to me."

2273
02:11:37,899 --> 02:11:39,857
"All those tales..."

2274
02:11:40,315 --> 02:11:42,606
"...which I want to keep..."

2275
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:47,606
"...etched in my memory forever."

2276
02:11:48,606 --> 02:11:50,526
"As you walk me..."

2277
02:11:50,606 --> 02:11:53,526
"...down that same lane."

2278
02:11:53,606 --> 02:11:58,606
"I want to stay for a while."

2279
02:11:58,690 --> 02:12:02,815
"I am waiting, o Life."

2280
02:12:04,149 --> 02:12:08,524
"Hold my hand and guide me."

2281
02:12:20,565 --> 02:12:22,606
"I was a little disillusioned."

2282
02:12:22,690 --> 02:12:25,315
"And also a little cheeky."

2283
02:12:25,565 --> 02:12:29,774
"Every mischief followed by another."

2284
02:12:30,357 --> 02:12:33,107
"All those whom I troubled."

2285
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,649
"Were right before me."

2286
02:12:35,732 --> 02:12:40,690
"Those friends were my real treasures."

2287
02:12:41,607 --> 02:12:43,569
"I want to face them..."

2288
02:12:43,649 --> 02:12:46,482
"...and take a good eyeful."

2289
02:12:46,732 --> 02:12:51,606
"The moments that I lived back then."
