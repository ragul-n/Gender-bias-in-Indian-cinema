'Tada Forest'

3
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:57,307
What happened?

4
00:03:57,546 --> 00:03:58,506
What is it?

5
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:00,668
- What happened, Thiru?
- Don't know

6
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:02,350
Come on

7
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:27,680
Who are you?

8
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,439
Why did you come to this forest?

9
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:32,201
Sir, actually we are from-

10
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:35,922
Yov! Why did you hit me?

11
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:37,642
Sir, I was talking to yo-

12
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:41,206
Our business is smuggling red sandalwood

13
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,808
If you come in mufti
you think I can't find out?

14
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:49,048
You've got it wrong

15
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:52,646
We are not cops, sir

16
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,369
We took the wrong route
when we were on an important mission

17
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:58,649
We landed here

18
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:01,209
Please, sir
Let us go

19
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,692
If we don't
my life will be ruined

20
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,772
Please

21
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:10,254
I don't think he understands
Someone please translate

22
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,454
Sir, your assumption is wrong

23
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:14,614
We are on our way
for a very important task

24
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,936
If we don't go now
it will be disastrous

25
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,098
'Please, sir'

26
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:21,977
Wow!

27
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,740
'Even this redwood is soooper'

28
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,462
Leave her behind and you can leave

29
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:37,384
Thiru!

30
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:22,799
Thiru, it's getting late
Let's go from here

31
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:49,689
Thiru, come

32
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:46,351
'You landed in the forest
taking a wrong route'

33
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:50,630
'Thanks to you we have arrested
the culprit we were looking for ages'

34
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,472
What happened to your vehicle?

35
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,712
- Our car had a break-down
- Don't worry

36
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:56,033
We'll drop you
in our police jeep

37
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,633
'Constable?
Take them'

38
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:15,595
'Who are they?'

39
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:16,915
'Where are they heading?'

40
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,597
'What are they searching?'

41
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:22,840
'Between this film's title and these people
are you wondering why there's no link?'

42
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,080
'Even if they look serious'

43
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,921
'...actually they are really
a very lame, ordinary gang'

44
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,842
'The extent to which they are lame-'

45
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,004
'90 days ago'

46
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,765
'This is our hero...Thiru'

47
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:41,046
'Age...for many years he is
stuck on the same number!'

48
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,887
'Profession
Matrimony'

49
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,529
'To put it decently
Marriage broker'

50
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,732
'He's into this business
because he didn't get any other job'

51
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:52,011
'You can gauge from this
his educational qualifications!'

52
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,372
Of course he is an Engineering student

53
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:57,133
'This girl who feels
like Anushka Sharma'

54
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,253
'...she will introduce herself to you'

55
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:02,655
Thiru, a new girl has applied
for our Matrimony

56
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:04,176
The groom is ready for her

57
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:05,136
Take a look

58
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:10,899
Love is different from friendship

59
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:13,095
I have an image of how
the love of my life should be

60
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:14,979
No way will you fit
into that category

61
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,218
How many times to tell you?

62
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,459
When you travel long distance

63
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,419
...won't you carry a spare
anticipating a flat tyre?

64
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:22,941
Feel free to love any girl
but only I am your 'stepney' love

65
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:26,221
You also free to love any guy
but only I am your 'stepney' lover

66
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:29,423
Madcap! How many times to tell you?
Are you brainless or what?

67
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,905
'People generally think twice
to buy a second hand car'

68
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:34,465
'He is bending backwards
for a 2nd hand girlfriend'

69
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,427
'He is Akash'

70
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:40,189
'Next you'll see Thiru's family'

71
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:42,189
Dad, what was so urgent?

72
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:43,510
I'm here now, tell me

73
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:46,433
You keep finding brides
for everyone in this town

74
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,990
I have found a bride for you

75
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,353
Take a look at her snap
You'll be zapped!

76
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:54,553
When I started my Matrimony website
she was the 1st girl I found a groom for

77
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,915
I have fixed so many weddings

78
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:58,355
I've warned you not to
steal photos from my office

79
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:01,316
Father and son have been
whispering for a long time

80
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,638
I can see your lips move
but I can't hear anything

81
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:06,241
I keep telling you to buy
a hearing aid, you never listen

82
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:07,319
What is he saying?

83
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,760
If she uses a hearing aid...

84
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,041
...people will know she is
hearing impaired it seems

85
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,321
Raising your tone to talk to amma
do you have to yell-

86
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,957
'You would've met 1 madcap per family
but an entire mad family, this is 1st time'

87
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:21,639
- Where is the file I had kept?
- How can a peacock come into our life?

88
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,602
'This is Dr Ramakrishnan'

89
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:32,365
'He is a character with
maximum weight in this story!'

90
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:35,246
'But don't ask me
to guess his weight!'

91
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,925
- Send it to my room
- Okay, doctor

92
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:42,407
I find it tough to
even break the news

93
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:45,288
You have a weak heart

94
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,089
So in another 10 or 15 days-

95
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:49,210
Will I die in 10 or 15 days, huh?

97
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:51,932
Hold it

98
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,012
Knowing you'll die soon
you're dancing happily

99
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,893
I won't be able to see my death

100
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,535
At least you watch and enjoy, doctor

101
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,377
Here...I'm waiting

102
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:19,464
When I was sharpening my pencil...

103
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:22,541
...the blade cut my finger
and it started bleeding

104
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,463
It shouldn't become septic
So I applied Betadine

105
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:25,944
I took painkiller Taxine

106
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:29,065
I'll be okay if you give me
a Tetanus Toxoid shot

107
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:30,586
Why don't you inject it yourself?

108
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:32,628
Okay, doctor, if you give me
the syringe, I can-

109
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,107
Nurse, come here

110
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:36,749
Administer an ATC shot
and in the morning-

111
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,388
Get the TT injection also

112
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,632
Why is your pulse
making a tick-tick sound?

113
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:46,552
Because you're holding my watch!

114
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,155
Nurse, give him that antibiotic

115
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:50,633
Don't take it on an empty stomach

116
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:52,435
Should I wear a t-shirt, doctor?

117
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:54,075
Who are you?

118
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,956
- I'm Thiru
- I'm Dr Ramakrishnan

119
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,756
- Doctor...!
- What happened now?

120
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:01,717
It hurts like hell

121
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,922
A blade scratched you on the surface

122
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,241
You're making a fuss
as if you are on your death bed

123
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,761
A girl is about to die
in another 15 days

124
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:10,441
A girl will lose her life in 15 days

125
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,041
Even after knowing this
she danced like Prabhu Deva!

126
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:14,442
Who is she, doctor?

127
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:17,524
My death is confirmed

128
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:19,925
That girl over there
clad in a yellow 'churidhar'

129
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:29,364
"A girl like this so pretty
I swear on the Almighty"

130
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:33,166
"I've never met till now, believe me"

131
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,046
"This very minute, right now"

132
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:38,249
- Pencil...?
- Sir...?

133
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:39,970
You can't take your eyes off her

134
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,371
Do you know that girl?

135
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,931
'I saw her 1st in the temple
in Kumbakonam'

136
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:49,374
'I was stunned by her affection
towards that grandma'

137
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:51,893
They are not part of her family at all

138
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:54,135
'She has brought the inmates
of an Old age Home'

139
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,776
'...to visit the temples here'

140
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,575
'And bought them new clothes too'

141
00:12:58,656 --> 00:12:59,778
No chance, sir

142
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:01,776
I sincerely love her

143
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,581
'A sudden strike was announced
in Kumbakonam on that day'

144
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,501
'All modes of transport
had come to a standstill'

145
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,984
'When I was wondering
how to befriend her-'

146
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:18,263
'We are already half way
to the temple, get a cab'

147
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:20,624
'I realized she had missed her friends'

148
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:23,066
'and was stranded'

149
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,828
'At that point of time
the Bullet bike I got'

150
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,746
'...was like a man who was ravenous
finding a plateful of spicy 'parotta''

151
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:44,592
'My love life that had swept me
off my feet like a rocket'

152
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:46,993
'...was slowed down with
a sudden brake by the God Almighty'

153
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,555
Hey! Watch it!

154
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:54,717
'When I opened my eyes
my girl was half-drowning'

155
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:57,839
'Don't get me wrong
I meant water, not liquor!'

156
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:02,838
Thanks to your accident my dress tore

157
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,287
Is this you as a kid?

158
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,647
- You are beautiful
- I want my phone back

159
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,808
Give it to me

160
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:26,370
'I want my phone'

161
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,168
Dai!

162
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:39,211
I want my phone!!

163
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:59,097
Imagination, huh?

164
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:02,819
'When I felt bad missing
the easy ball bowled to me'

165
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:06,699
'...like a Godsend the bowler gave me
a chance to lap it up as a sixer'

166
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,542
'That blessed bowler
was Bullet Pushparaj'

167
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:12,622
Who ruined my 'wife'?

168
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,184
Excuse me, are you
part of a drama troupe?

169
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:18,066
You were the one who ran away
with my brother's wife?

170
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:19,185
Don't get what he said?

171
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,023
My bike and my wife
are same, he said

172
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,267
What did you do to my 'wife'?

173
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:25,027
Sorry, I misused your wife

174
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,189
He is being so blatant

175
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:29,150
- Sorry
- OH!

176

Have you professed
your love to her?

183
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:07,122
Her thought process is, 'I will anyway
die soon, why should I hurt him?'

184
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:09,441
She's hiding her feelings for me

185
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:11,203
Don't worry about all that

186
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:15,205
I'll convince that girl, make her come
straight to me and say I love yo-

187
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:18,845
It's my responsibility to make her
profess her love to you, okay?

189
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:26,289
Sumangali who'll die soon
isn't only a patient but a close friend

190

- Don't worry, we'll save her
- I believe we will too

191
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,569
Our association should
bear her operation expenses

192

Thanks a lot

198
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:45,093
I had taken a vow
to visit the temple in Pazhani

199
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,093
Looks like Lord Muruga has called me

200
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:56,978
How is it possible?

201
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,298
Why...when you're so young?

202
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,618
I got to know only now
that I'll be leaving very early

203
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:05,021
How can you be so casual about it?

204
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,422
What's the big deal?

205
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:07,943
When God wills it

206
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,141
...do we have a choice?

207
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,023
Excuse me

208
00:17:12,101 --> 00:17:14,582
Ceremonial offering of 'Kaavadi'
will also be carried

209
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:16,465
Carrying it in the morning or evening?

210
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:19,467
Should you decide
even the time now?

211
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:23,627
Better to confirm
everything before going

212
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,508
You want to garland me?

213
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,749
I don't want all that fanfare

214
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:30,711
Instead of spending on garland

215
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,952
...you can spend it on
the poor and needy

216
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:34,071

00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:37,753
Hey, I won't be here on the 15th
I'm going, it has been confirmed

218
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:39,674
Don't feel bad I'm going

219
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:40,833
I'll take leave

You're saying
that girl will die in a fortnight

225
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,880
Will they give
only 15 sovereigns of gold?

226
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:02,042
I came with 50 sovereigns of gold
however pathetic a groom you may be

227
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,604
Imagine for my son-

228
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:05,725
Aiyo! No, in 15 days he says-

229
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:07,565
Appa! I can't bear your raised tone

230
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:09,004
On top of it
you flap your hands?

231
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,886
I can't talk
without gesturing!

232
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:12,885
You're my only son, dear

233
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,328
I had built castles in the air
for your wedding

234
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:18,967
My heart bleeds hearing you say
you want to marry a girl who'll die

235
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:21,930
Dad, when your entire family
opposed your wedding

236
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,811
...weren't you adamant about marrying
my hearing impaired amma?

237

I'm your son, pa

238
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,291
It isn't the number of
days together that count

239
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,252
What matters is how much I love her

240
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:32,213
I love her THAT much

241
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,054
He has been saying
he doesn't like her

242
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:35,576
Why are you compelling him?

243
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,816
- Aiyo!
- Why are you keeping quiet?

244
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,898
As if you'll understand
even if I speak, madcap!

245

'madcap' alone properly?

Please go to the loo!

351
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:16,959
'I operated on her today'

352
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,878
It's a medical miracle!

353
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,798
She will lead a long and healthy life

354
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,279
Sir...?

355
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,680
Is that so?

356
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,081
'Yes, my dear man'

357
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:27,200
Your love is that powerful

358
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:30,164
What did she say?

359
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:33,603
1st she hesitated, then my daughter
spoke about you and convinced her

360
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:35,284
She made her agree

361
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:37,126
Oh! So sweet

362
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:39,726
Please thank her on my behalf

363
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,049
My daughter is right next to me
You thank her yourself

364
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,289
Listen, dear

365
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:45,288
Sumangali's boyfriend Thiru

366
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:46,566
Thiru, huh?

367
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,612
- Hello
- Thank you very much

368
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,853
Actually I should only thank you

369
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:57,294
By the way Thiru
I have a question for you

370
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,975
How did you fall in love with that girl?

371
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:04,938
I fell flat, love at 1st glance!

372
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,381
You laugh just like her

373
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,583
"This maiden...this mesmerizing missy
I love her to the highest degree"

374
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:28,263
"I like her immensely"

375
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:32,745
"That damsel...so adorably awesome
I love her to kingdom come"

376
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:36,467
"Sky is the limit to loving her ways winsome"

377
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:44,951
"This girl...this glam-doll divine
I love her till the end of time"

378
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:47,549
"I like her SO much, her looks sublime"

379
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:52,232
"That beautiful babe, my precious princess
My love for her is ever so limitless"

380
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:55,114
"For keeps, my tryst will continue tireless"

381
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:04,317
"Miles away, far faraway endlessly
She is distancing herself from me"

382
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:07,118
"She's kidnapping me cleverly"

383
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,042
"This maiden...this mesmerizing missy
I love her to the highest degree"

384
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:16,762
"I like her immensely"

385
00:26:35,884 --> 00:26:38,607
"No make-up on her face
Her hair not combed in place"

386
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:41,049
"But I like her face full of grace"

387
00:26:41,127 --> 00:26:45,930
"No perfume or jasmine on her hair
But I like the scent of this woman fair"

388
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:50,653
"Not roly-poly or skinny as a beanpole
But I still like her shape on the whole"

389
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:55,773
"She doesn't speak English or Hindi
I love this Tamil girl so heavenly"

390
00:26:55,935 --> 00:27:00,574
"I've gone bonkers over her, I'm mad
Laughing and talking to myself; so sad"

391
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:04,818
"Not yet married to my true love
But I've become her husband now"

392
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:09,860
"This girl...this glam-doll divine
I love her till the end of time"

393
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,621
"I like her SO much, her looks sublime"

394
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,031
"With her quid eyes playful
she swallows me soulful"

395
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,870
"I love that, ever so beautiful"

396
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:53,754
"If I look at her all of a sudden
I love the way she looks back, this siren"

397
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:58,594
"My own birthday I just don't care
But her birthday is a special affair"

398
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:03,237
"More than my own mother and father
her parents have a special corner"

399
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:08,398
"I'm a slave to all her pranks impish"

400
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:12,760
"Being dad to her baby I'll really relish"

401
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:17,763
"This beautiful babe, my precious princess
My love for her is ever so limitless"

402
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:20,483
"For keeps, I'll treasure timeless"

403
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:25,043
"That damsel...so adorably awesome
I love her to kingdom come"

404
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:27,847
"Sky is the limit to loving her ways winsome"

405
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:37,088
"Miles away, far faraway endlessly
She is distancing herself from me"

406
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:39,809
"She's kidnapping me joyously"

407
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:51,215
Doctor is so punctual

408
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,937
He has even come with my girl
He truly rocks!

409
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,138
Who is that?

410
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:00,898
May be the doctor's daughter?

411
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:03,780
But no resemblance whatsoever

412
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:05,820
May resemble her mother
Why bother?

413
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:09,740
We are here to speak our hearts out

414
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,703
Tell me what is in your mind

415
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:13,504
Come on

416
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,306
The very 1st time I saw you...

417
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:19,505
...I flipped for you

418
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:22,745
A niggling doubt whether
you'll accept my love or not

419
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:23,908
But...

420
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:26,510
For you...for accepting my love

421
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,908
For her, for making you accept

422
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,749
I have no words to express

423
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,268
No words at all

424
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,268
He was very candid about his thoughts

425
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,068
Now open your mind, come on

426
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:49,035
Even if one feels that way

427
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:50,553
...how can a girl

428
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:53,514
...openly, publicly express her love?

429
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:54,873
It is tough, right?

430
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:56,275
I can understand

431
00:29:57,676 --> 00:30:00,878
I can see your eyes
overflowing with love!

432
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:05,760
Hello, please come

433
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:06,838
Greetings

434
00:30:06,877 --> 00:30:09,201
The girl looks very pretty

435
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,842
- Can we fix an auspicious wedding date?
- Sure...sure

436
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:13,682
What are you yakking about?

437
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:16,845
Why don't you find out if we can
fix an auspicious wedding date?

438
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:18,564
Is she short of hearing?

439
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:22,046
Sir, she is a little
HARD OF HEARING!

440
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:23,886
I can hear very well

I'm indebted to this girl who united
both our families into this happy knot

444
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:33,009

00:30:50,174 --> 00:30:51,215
I know

451
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:52,655
Hey! Look at this

452
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:03,780
Yeah, this is Dubai king speaking

453
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:05,580
To India?

454
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:07,222
I have no time to fly down to India

455
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,461
Bye...bye

456
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:11,261
What's news, dude?

457
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:13,703
Do you have to get married?

458
00:31:13,743 --> 00:31:14,864
Absolutely...!

459
00:31:16,386 --> 00:31:17,545
Time now is 7:30

460
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,666
If you get married now
your whole life will be jinxed

461
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,347
My dad says he'll die if I don't marry

462
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:23,107
If you marry, you'll die post wedding!

463
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,908
This girl is from Chennai
Her name is Sara

464
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:26,989
Take a look

465
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,673
- Reject this girl
- What do you mean?

466
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:39,474
- No need
- Tell me why

467
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:09,241
Sara!

468
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:12,001
Hey, get up
No limit to selfies!

469
00:32:12,044 --> 00:32:14,045
- Get lost!
- Move...move

470
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:16,604
Sara

471
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,725
Give her water

472
00:32:17,764 --> 00:32:19,125
- Doctor
- 'Hey Thiru'

473
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,727
You said my girlfriend won't
have any other hassle?

474
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:23,288
She was lying unconscious on the road

475
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:25,690
She is eating 'masala dosa'
in front of me!

476
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:28,608
- 'Masala dosa'?
- Because 'onion rava dosa' takes time

477
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,852
This is just a filler

478
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,290
Aiyo! Doctor

479
00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:33,493
Confirmed my girlfriend is here

480
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:34,811
Where are you now?

481
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:54,935
Aiyo!

482
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:57,018
Will both of you talk coherently?

483
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,738
- I've brought your girlfriend, Thiru
- Sir

484
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,659
This is your daughter, sir

485
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,901
She is my girlfriend, sir

486
00:33:04,503 --> 00:33:06,022
Take your hands off

487
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,021
Appa, no-

488
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:08,505
Aiyo! She is my daughter

489
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:11,304
Getting my daughter
and your girlfriend mixed up

490
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:13,544
So is your daughter my girlfriend?

491
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:15,505
Why are you confusing me?

492
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:17,907
Wait...wait

493
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:19,468
Be very clear about this

494
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:21,749
Who is daughter and who is girlfriend?

495
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:23,188
He is clear

496
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:24,310
Only we are confused!

497
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,308
What are you saying?

498
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:26,470
Doctor...daughter

499
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:28,030
Boyfriend girlfriend

500
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,311
What are you thinking?

501
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,353
He thought you will die within 15 days

502
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:37,274
He was still ready to marry you

503
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,515
He must be having a heart of gold!

504
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:42,316
'1st time I set eyes on you...'

505
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:43,358
'I fell in love with you'

506
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:44,438
'How is it possible?'

507
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:46,920
'Why come at such an early age?'

508
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:51,075
'He is performing 'Navadhanya' ritual
for her to lead a long and healthy life'

509
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:59,680
I never expected you to do this

510
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:01,840
No need

511
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,241
Stop right now

512
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,561
If I say so...

513
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:08,322
...are you prepared to listen?

514
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:15,926
Promise?

By the way
this is Sara's elder sister

528
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,937
My first born Gayathri

529
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:50,821
- 'Vanakkam'
- Her doctor husband Arun

530
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:54,740
Thiru has conducted 99 marriages
through his matrimonial agency, so far

531
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,704
I am so glad this is his 100th
and happens to be his own wedding

532
00:34:57,743 --> 00:35:02,265
This coming Friday let us go to Tirupati
and get Lord Balaji's blessings

533
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:05,944
Very same evening we will perform
Ring changing ceremony and Reception

534
00:35:05,944 --> 00:35:07,544
Next morning

535
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:09,264
Wedding

536
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:10,946
Maro, okay with my plans?

537
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,825
Maro...?

538
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:15,309
If brother can be 'bro'

539
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:17,948
...why can't son-in-law who is
'marumagan' be 'maro'?

540
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,991
Listen, my dear
I have an idea

541
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,433
Why can't we conduct
this wedding in Tirupati?

542
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:26,473
Bride's father is of the same opinion!

543
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:29,955
No need to print invitations

544
00:35:30,034 --> 00:35:32,033
If the groom's father
shouts from a flyover

545
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:33,516
...entire Tamil Nadu can hear!

546
00:35:33,554 --> 00:35:34,635
1 minute, sir

547
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,356
- Hey Raja
- From Dubai?

548
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:40,316
Hey Thiru, how are you?

549
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:42,239
I thought of calling you
How are you?

550
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:44,401
- 'I am fine'
- Okay...okay

551
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,802
- You are coming here tomorrow
- 'Why?'

552
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,881
I am getting married
in Tirupati on Sunday

553
00:35:48,924 --> 00:35:51,163
Leave here tomorrow?
Are you kidding?

554
00:35:51,402 --> 00:35:53,205
I have 4 hotels
under my control in Dubai

555
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:55,006
Even 1 day of my absence
will be a disaster

556
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:56,045
'You-'

557
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:57,605
Hey...! No cuss words

558
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:01,328
Fine, I'll come tomorrow
and conduct your wedding

559
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:02,688
Who was that, 'maro'?

560
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,607
Sir, my friend from Dubai

561
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:08,569
Raja...from 3rd grade
he and I are thick as thieves, sir

562
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:11,728
He will forsake his life
for his friend, sir

563
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:21,459
'Hey...love marriage or
arranged marriage for you?'

564
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,620
'After you stick your head
on the railway track...'

565
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:26,701
...what does it matter if it is
Cheran Express or Pandyan Express?

566
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:29,981
Thiru is getting married tomorrow
Why talk of death, a bad omen?

567
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,700
Marriage is a bad omen, dude

568
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,903
He is negative because he is
frustrated he's still single!

569
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,504
But our bride is in a different league

570
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:37,984
Simple and homely

571
00:36:38,026 --> 00:36:39,746
She won't even lift her head

572
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:41,986
Nowadays girls bend
only to fiddle with their iPhones!

573
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:44,226
"I love her till the end of time"

574
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,227
Show me

575
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:46,988
"You will like her SO much"

576
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:50,390
Take a look
You will be shocked

577
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:29,722
Loveleaks is a popular website

578
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:33,806
Whatever lovers are upto in
theaters, beach and parks

579
00:37:33,844 --> 00:37:36,366
...are recorded and uploaded
without their knowledge

580
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:38,128
This video was leaked
in that manner

581
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,207
I'm in Dubai and I know
How come you're unaware?

582
00:37:40,246 --> 00:37:42,206
Hey, don't spare her

583
00:37:42,248 --> 00:37:43,809
Hey Thiru, call her

584
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,371
Hey Thiru, don't
Listen to me

585
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,169
- You'll get into a fix
- Engaged, huh?

586
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:49,130
- Young age, that's why
- Try again

587
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:53,013
These girls when young play with toys
When they grow up they play with boys!

588
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:56,493
Not reachable?
So what?

589
00:37:58,495 --> 00:38:01,174
Record a video with
all the cuss words you know

590
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:02,616
Maximum swear words

591
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:04,935
You want me to yell at her?

592
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:08,498
Sara

593
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:10,577
I loved you with all my heart

594
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,657
But you-

595
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:12,657
What is it now?

596
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:13,819
What heart...far-

597
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:16,859
Your words should be intense
with full emotion

598
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:18,621
Think you are the cat's whiskers?

599
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:20,657
You should be blunt
Not sugarcoat

600
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,499
Yell now, full force
I'll take care

601
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:25,899
Hey you! Sara

602
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,141
Consider yourself the cat-

603
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:29,503
Cat's whiskers?

604
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:30,621
Now what?

605
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:32,423
Why that pause
between cat and whiskers?

606
00:38:32,464 --> 00:38:34,981
What you said sounds like
the cat has whiskers!

607
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:36,224
Not like that

608
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:37,423
Cat's whiskers!

609
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:38,944
- Cat's whiskers!
- Big shot

610
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,026
Cat's whiskers

611
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:46,187
Hey you! Sara!

612
00:38:46,428 --> 00:38:48,387
Think you are the cat's whiskers?

613
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,550
I fell flat for you and
chased you night and day

614
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:54,269
But you want a man a day!

615
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,832
Your sister is like crow's crap!

616
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:59,313
Your father isn't
father-in-law only to me

617
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:00,352
Let me tell you

618
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,314
'He is the father of all procurers!'

619
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:04,836
Choosing a bride from
a 3rd rate family like yours

620
00:39:04,874 --> 00:39:07,474
...when we are far superior
we should die of shame

621
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:09,757
Do you know
how sincerely I loved you?

622
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:12,797
When I told you to exchange
your old phone for a new one

623
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,079
You refused saying
you like to have 2 phones

624
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,318
I didn't understand then
Now I know what you meant

625
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,760
You like 2 of everything

626
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,521
I AM A SECOND HAND!

627
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:25,120
May even be 3rd or 4th hand!

628
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,561
Even 5th or 6th!

629
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:29,003
You think only you can
have a 2nd hand?

630
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,163
Thiru can't, huh?

631
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,762
I am Thiru's second hand

632
00:39:32,445 --> 00:39:34,887
Sara will be so mortified
she will wish she's dead

633
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:36,325
Call yourself a friend?

634
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:37,925
Playing with your friend's life?

635
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:39,807
- Goody-goody!
- I like that

636
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,528
She has already played her game

637
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,249
Do you know the meaning of friend?

638
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:46,008
When you write 'friend'
last 3 letters spell 'end'

639
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,210
One who walks till the very end

640
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,974
Now let me 'send'

641
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,178
- What, dude?
- Hey!

642
00:40:07,258 --> 00:40:09,739
I've been trying to
reach you since 4'o clock

643
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:13,180
Sara and her father
have already left for Tirupati

644
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:15,584
He's talking to someone else
instead of calling his son

645
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,382
- Hey, who is on the phone?
- My dad

646
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,062
Immediately stop the wedding

647
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,139
Tell him to cancel the wedding

648
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,659
- Appa
- Hey! Don't

649
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,782
- Give me the phone
- Why are you snatching it?

650
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:27,100
Stop playing the fool

651
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,142
It's his life
Give it to me

652
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:30,381
Listen to-

653
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:32,984
Hey! Don't-

654
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,624
Talk...go ahead

655
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,827
[carefree laughter]

656
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,029
'You watched a sample
of joyous laughter'

657
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,511
'Next you'll be seeing a bride'

658
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:53,110
'Suppose she is in contact with
a smart guy like me before her wedding'

659
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:55,671
'Coming to know about this...'

660
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:58,354
'...the entire town will
ridicule the bridegroom'

661
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:00,033
[scornful laughter]

662
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:10,558
- Bash him
- Don't hit me

663
00:41:10,558 --> 00:41:11,880
Why mess up my friend’s life?

664
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:14,040
- Stop it!
- How long have you known Sara?

665
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,320
Why are you hitting my son?

666
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,042
For what your son did-

667
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:19,603
Your assumptions are all wrong

668
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:22,321
'I used to mimic many people
even when I was a kid'

669
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,364
'My dream was to become
#1 in mimicry'

670
00:41:24,403 --> 00:41:27,003
'I visited several TV channels
to fulfill this dream'

671
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:29,885
'But my talent never received
the due recognition it deserved'

672
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:33,806
'Out of frustration I decided
to commit suicide'

673
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:36,769
NO

674
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,257
'Sara madam was the one
who rescued me at that time'

675
00:42:03,536 --> 00:42:05,417
'The First Aid she administered...'

676
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:09,140
'...was captured in a mobile by someone
who uploaded it in Facebook'

677
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,261
'But not bothering about it one bit'

678
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:16,141
'...she nurtured my career
by getting me a job in a TV channel'

679
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:17,783
'She was God in human form!'

680
00:42:22,785 --> 00:42:30,344
"Trusting many a 'forever friend'
this heart has been deceived in the end"

681
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:33,825
[song from 'Simla Special']

682
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:37,425
"This heart has been back stabbed in the end"

683
00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:43,630
"Toddy and milk differ by name
But in color look the same"

684
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:46,992
When you were leaving for
your wedding in a happy frame of mind

685
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,793
...the scumbag who showed you this video

686
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,471
If only I get hold of him
my slippers will speak!

687
00:42:53,276 --> 00:42:57,236
Fortunately your presence of mind
brought you here directly

688
00:42:57,673 --> 00:42:59,754
If you had listened to
the advice of bad friends...

689
00:42:59,796 --> 00:43:03,357
...and yelled at her
in a drunken state

690
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,198
'...your marriage would
have been called off'

691
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:28,687
That's why I cautioned you, dude

692
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:31,206
Not to text in a drunken stupor

693
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:33,685
Mistake, machan

694
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:36,126
Even I said

695
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:41,971
...to enquire properly before calling
even though I was drunk

696
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:45,731
Machaan!

697
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,293
- Dude!
- Thiru

698
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:48,374
Don't get mad at me

699
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:50,333
I did all this
purely in good faith

700
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:51,375
Don't get mad at me

701
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:52,414
Drop it

702
00:43:52,734 --> 00:43:53,775
Okay, forget it

703
00:43:53,775 --> 00:43:55,656
He was in a drunken stupor

704
00:43:56,857 --> 00:44:00,417
What is the use of forgetting now?
She would've seen my message

705
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:02,896
My wedding has been called off

706
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,299
Because of you-

707
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:08,181
Machan, your phone

708
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:09,180
Pick it up

709
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,821
Just check who's calling

710
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,383
Dubai, move aside

711
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:16,704
Uncle is calling from there

712
00:44:16,744 --> 00:44:18,224
Why are you hesitating?

713
00:44:18,264 --> 00:44:19,585
Be bold and speak up

714
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:21,985
If he sounds positive
means he didn't see your text

715
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,667
- In case he sounds negative
- End of story!

716
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:26,908
Dubai, you'll be dead meat, man

717
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,830
Attend the call

718
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:32,151
'Hi 'maro', good morning,
Where are you?'

719
00:44:32,151 --> 00:44:33,790
He hasn't seen it
Go ahead, reply

720
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,231
- Maro?
- Talk to him

721
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:39,788
'Where are you, maro?'

722
00:44:40,189 --> 00:44:41,270
Where are you?

723
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,471
At Thiruvalangadu
on the way to Tirupati

724
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,991
Our whole family is in
the temple of our family deity

725
00:44:46,032 --> 00:44:48,311
'If Sara gets the right match
we had taken a vow'

726
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:51,833
...to adorn our Lord Shiva with silk,
light lamps as per our custom

727
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:53,676
And distribute food
to all the devotees

728
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:55,238
That is in progress now

729
00:44:59,478 --> 00:45:01,558
I asked God
for a good son-in-law

730
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:03,039
But...

731
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:06,158
...I never expected He would
bless me with a good son!

732
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,440
Maro, don't mistake me
for asking you

733
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:11,681
I need a small favor

734
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:14,524
On your way, at Tamil Nadu
and Andhra border...

735
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:17,964
...there is a small 'idli' shop
at Kanakammachatram

736
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:20,405
'Masala vada' in that shop
is simply sooooper!

737
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:24,206
If you can get me a few crisp 'vadas'
and thick coconut 'chutney' as take away

738
00:45:24,566 --> 00:45:27,648
My stomach will remember you
till my last breath, huh!?

739
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:32,369
- Okay, sir
- 'Why are you calling me sir?'

740
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:33,851
'Call me mama'

741
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,692
'Or call me 'mamov'
in a stylish way'

742
00:45:36,971 --> 00:45:38,729
'Come soon, maro'

743
00:45:40,453 --> 00:45:41,812
Okay, uncle

744
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,613
You heard that?

745
00:45:47,654 --> 00:45:48,774
Happy now?

746
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:51,414
Hey

747
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:56,057
Don't worry, there is an easy way
to stop Sara from seeing this message

748
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:59,176
There is an option
'Delete for everyone'

749
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,818
When you delete from your phone...

750
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,460
...she won't be able to see it

751
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:03,979
Even I am aware of that

752
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:05,900
But that holds good
only for an hour

753
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:07,462
A whole night has passed

754
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:09,302
- This can't be deleted
- Yes

755
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:11,700
Both of you dozed off
totally tanked last night

756
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:12,983
Then how can you delete?

757
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,903
'How dumb can they get!
Highly irresponsible'

758
00:46:14,946 --> 00:46:17,105
Don't lose your cool, Thiru
Give me your phone

759
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,785
I can see only a single tick

760
00:46:20,025 --> 00:46:23,029
Message has been delivered
but Sara has not read it

761
00:46:23,346 --> 00:46:24,868
Okay...?
Look at me

762
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,910
Your uncle will take atleast
90 minutes to leave Thiruvalangadu

763
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:31,553
Between Thiruvalangadu and Tirupati...

764
00:46:31,593 --> 00:46:33,312
...you won't get signal anywhere

765
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:35,074
Because I've travelled that route

766
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:38,115
There is no chance of Sara
seeing the message before that

767
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:40,956
So...if we leave
immediately from here

768
00:46:41,036 --> 00:46:44,513
...catch up with your father-in-law's car
and take the phone from Sara

769
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,352
- All issues can be solved
- Let's do this

770
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:48,794
If we take the Tada route
we can catch Sara's car

771
00:46:50,193 --> 00:46:51,475
So says Google!

772
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:11,726
"Breeze wafting over the screwpine flower
Makes a fragrant impact on me forever"

773
00:47:11,763 --> 00:47:14,763
"The floral scent sets the stage for me"

774
00:47:14,805 --> 00:47:17,845
"Converses like a lass ever so lovely"

775
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:20,047
[song from 'Mullum Malarum']

776
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:21,208
What a song!

777
00:47:22,126 --> 00:47:23,930
No one can match our Ilaiyaraja

778
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:26,089
Is it that easy to be hailed 'maestro'?

779
00:47:26,328 --> 00:47:27,330
Soooper!

780
00:47:27,689 --> 00:47:29,209
Listen to the violin now

781
00:47:35,454 --> 00:47:37,333
I can hear someone
munching 'murukku'

782
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:42,055
Grinding your teeth?

783
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:43,298
Sorry

784
00:47:47,894 --> 00:47:50,137
Hey Dubai, have you set
the right address in Google?

785
00:47:50,178 --> 00:47:51,216
- Yeah
- By the way

786
00:47:51,256 --> 00:47:52,816
'Have you taken
this route earlier?'

787
00:47:52,856 --> 00:47:53,859
Then what?

788
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:54,897
Recently

789
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,059
About 25 years ago

790
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,139
I went with my parents
to Tirupati to have my head tonsured

791
00:47:59,181 --> 00:48:00,658
I've typed that route

792
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:02,503
Check for yourself

793
00:48:03,862 --> 00:48:04,901
Tada

794
00:48:04,941 --> 00:48:06,102
Tada...Tada

795
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:08,664
'Tada Forest'

796
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:29,950
Don't worry, we'll drop them back
in our department's jeep

797
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,432
'Now...present moment'

798
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,679
Thank God
No blue tick!

799
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:51,678
Sara hasn't seen it as yet

800
00:48:51,836 --> 00:48:53,877
Should go before Sara sees the message

801
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:55,075
We'll make it

802
00:48:58,597 --> 00:49:00,559
As it is we are
late by 30 minutes

803
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,920
By now they would've reached Tirupati

804
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:06,161
- Sir, how far is Tirupati?
- 13 km away, sir

805
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:08,520
- Thirteen, huh?
- Please speed up, sir

806
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:31,330
Hey, we have reached Tirupati

807
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:32,773
Please God, save us

808
00:49:40,213 --> 00:49:41,694
Sir, that's the hotel

809
00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:42,933
Take left

810
00:49:45,136 --> 00:49:47,137
Senior 'maro'
counted the suitcases?

811
00:49:47,178 --> 00:49:48,499
I'm checking, 'mama'

812
00:49:49,535 --> 00:49:51,298
Hey...junior 'maro'

813
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,659
Why have you come in police jeep?

814
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:56,902
On the way
our car...break down

815
00:49:56,941 --> 00:49:59,299
- Police...friend-
- Not anything drastic?

816
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:00,941
Thank God

817
00:50:03,703 --> 00:50:05,022
What?

818
00:50:05,262 --> 00:50:08,263
Did you get me the crisp 'vada'
and thick coconut chutney?

819
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:10,303
The crow pecked it away!

820
00:50:10,985 --> 00:50:12,386
Gone with the wind, huh?

821
00:50:12,907 --> 00:50:16,266
If you can't take care of a 'vada'
how will you handle life?

822
00:50:16,948 --> 00:50:18,227
It's okay

823
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:19,387
Sara

824
00:50:21,507 --> 00:50:23,590
- What?
- Gauging the happy mood

825
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:25,432
I don't think she has seen your message

826
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:27,390
Why do you say that in such a sad way?

827
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:30,194
Thiru...hi!

828
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:47,837
Appa...?

829
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,521
What, my dear?

830
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:25,743
Thiru, what is this?

831
00:51:26,102 --> 00:51:27,461
Why did you to this?

832
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,821
Do you know how sincerely I loved you?

833
00:51:31,062 --> 00:51:33,183
I never expected such a message!

834
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,861
Your father has ordered
1000 'laddus' for our wedding

835
00:51:38,381 --> 00:51:41,139
He has forwarded
that message to me proudly

836
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:43,658
'I have ordered
1000 'laddus' from Tirupati'

837
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:46,937
Why should your father do
what my father has to do?

838
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:50,377
Why did you hide
such a huge issue from me?

839
00:51:50,418 --> 00:51:51,778
Good question, my dear

840
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:55,658
Did my father send such a message?

841
00:51:56,138 --> 00:51:57,095
Yes

842
00:51:57,377 --> 00:51:58,337
Appa!

843
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,457
Let me see

844
00:52:00,814 --> 00:52:02,017
Low battery

845
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,655
Wait, 'maro'

846
00:52:06,014 --> 00:52:09,895
Ramesh is my close friend who is in charge
of the 'laddu' section in Tirupati temple

847
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:12,852
If your dad had told me
I would've ordered bigger 'laddus'

848
00:52:12,893 --> 00:52:15,454
He should do
what he is good at

849
00:52:15,573 --> 00:52:17,493
Your dad did what he shouldn't do

850
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,449
You didn't do
what you should have

851
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,931
You forgot 'vada' and my request

852
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:24,211
Hope you don't forget the bride

853
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:25,209
Thank god

854
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:28,889
Instead of a full stop, God has added
a comma and story continues

855
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:30,210
You may have escaped now

856
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,728
When phone gets charged
you're in for 'lathi' charge!

857
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:35,609
He has a PhD in Negativity
Nab him and thrash him

858
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:37,648
'Good omen for your married life'

859
00:52:41,169 --> 00:52:42,368
Welcome

860
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,606
Who said you can order 'laddu'?
Isn't it the bride's side protocol?

861
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:49,166
What is he saying?

862
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:50,965
Welcome

863
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:52,925
Taste this sample 'laddu'

864
00:52:57,724 --> 00:52:58,562
Please come

865
00:52:58,604 --> 00:53:01,044
Send 4 'laddus' to my room
without anyone's knowledge

866
00:53:01,123 --> 00:53:02,763
Didn't I ask you
what he's saying?

867
00:53:02,803 --> 00:53:07,083
Wants 4 'laddus' sent to his room
WITHOUT ANYONE'S KNOWLEDGE!

868
00:53:07,123 --> 00:53:10,003
- Why shout a secret so loudly?
- Has he gone?

869
00:53:12,284 --> 00:53:14,682
Aishu baby, take your
parents to 7th floor

870
00:53:14,723 --> 00:53:16,123
Daddy, which is my room?

871
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:17,838
Sara darling
#317 for you

872
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:19,559
Gayathri, your room is #318

873
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,798
Our rooms are adjacent

874
00:53:20,837 --> 00:53:23,114
- 'Maro'
- My room is on the top floor

875
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:25,517
Can I be in the 1st floor
or 2nd floor or-

876
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:27,714
- I can be in the 3rd floor?
- 3rd floor

877
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:29,395
Sir, 3rd floor is fully occupied

878
00:53:29,435 --> 00:53:31,795
You are spending so much
for our wedding

879
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:34,275
Your expenses are mounting

880
00:53:34,354 --> 00:53:35,356
Thank you

881
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:37,273
I can help you reduce cost

882
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:38,914
And stay in Sara's room

883
00:53:40,836 --> 00:53:43,233
- Did I hear you right?
- I am in #801

884
00:53:43,273 --> 00:53:44,755
Call me if you go down to eat

885
00:53:44,995 --> 00:53:46,596
#801 is a good number
Let's go

886
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:48,193
#302 is available, sir

887
00:53:53,473 --> 00:53:54,432
Thanks

888
00:54:10,991 --> 00:54:12,789
Keep my phone with you, sis

889
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:43,606
'Hey you! Sara!'

890
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:45,366
'Are you such a big shot?'

891
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:47,847
'I fell in love with you
wholeheartedly'

892
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,048
'But you need to break
a variety of hearts, huh?'

893
00:55:50,087 --> 00:55:52,325
Choosing a bride from
a 3rd rate family like yours

894
00:55:52,366 --> 00:55:53,728
...when we are far superior

895
00:55:53,807 --> 00:55:55,247
'Beat the wedding drums'

896
00:55:56,326 --> 00:55:57,403
NO!

897
00:55:58,323 --> 00:56:02,644
'You, your sister and your father
should be shot in the middle of the road'

898
00:56:02,685 --> 00:56:05,203
'Your father isn't 'mama' only to me'

899
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:07,444
'He is a procurer for the whole town!'

900
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:13,762
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

901
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:16,283
I trusted you totally

902
00:56:25,561 --> 00:56:26,560
Dream?

903
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,161
Was your wedding called off?

904
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:32,758
Phone!

905
00:56:43,235 --> 00:56:45,075
She will see your message very soon

906
00:56:45,116 --> 00:56:47,154
Your dream will come true!

907
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:50,675
I have come prepared with a silk sari
So you don't have to look for a bride

908
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:52,473
Because you are meant for me

909
00:56:54,754 --> 00:56:55,792
Thiru?

910
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:58,392
I'll receive my friends
and I'll be back

911
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,511
'Hi Sara'

912
00:57:03,352 --> 00:57:04,952
When did you come?

913
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,030
'Just now'

914
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:08,831
Salutations

915
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,951
- Yes, sir
- Actually I am

916
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,469
Bride groom...wedding

917
00:57:13,953 --> 00:57:17,391
I want to shift our baggage
to the bride's room #317

918
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:21,947
- For you?
- For me...keys

919
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:27,507
Please don't murder Telugu, sir

920
00:57:28,188 --> 00:57:29,149
Uncle!

921
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,269
1st let's have breakfast

922
00:57:31,308 --> 00:57:32,825
Sara was somewhere around

923
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:34,904
After going to the temple
we will enjoy-

924
00:57:35,264 --> 00:57:36,385
Sara, come here

925
00:57:37,183 --> 00:57:39,183
If you both want to chat in private

926
00:57:39,224 --> 00:57:42,782
...go to the reception area
or hall or even my room, okay?

927
00:57:42,863 --> 00:57:45,862
Please control yourself
till the wedding gets over, maro, okay?

928
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,781
People may get the wrong picture
I'll keep the keys, maro

929
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:50,980
- What, Thiru?
- Can we talk in your room?

930
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:52,182
You heard what dad said?

931
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,339
I can't come to your room
You can come to mine

932
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:56,020
Whatever it is, tell me here

933
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:57,020
1 second

934
00:57:57,418 --> 00:58:00,179
While I am talking to her
flick the keys from her bag

935
00:58:00,379 --> 00:58:01,861
- Ahh...okay
- Birthday

936
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,179
- Don't forget
- Done

937
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:04,418
- What is it?
- Wait

938
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:07,701
That is a flower pot

939
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,339
'That is a fountain'

940
00:58:11,177 --> 00:58:12,456
Car parking

941
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:14,896
Aiyo!

942
00:58:14,977 --> 00:58:17,776
Instead of pointing all around
will you come to the point?

943
00:58:18,056 --> 00:58:19,294
She is okay

944
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:21,538
What is in her bag?

945
00:58:21,576 --> 00:58:24,415
If by God's grace
we get married without any hitch

946
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:26,173
I vowed to get
your head tonsured

947
00:58:26,213 --> 00:58:27,693
Hey...are you crazy or what?

948
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:30,615
You're blabbering
just for the sake of chatting, go

949
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:32,933
'Come on, girls
Let's go to the dining hall'

950
00:58:34,454 --> 00:58:36,174
Let go of my hand...yuck!

951
00:58:36,773 --> 00:58:38,731
- It was a mistake, sorry
- Hey...continue

952
00:58:41,012 --> 00:58:42,049
Hello...!

953
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:43,210
Dude, no other go

954
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:44,889
Sara's room is in the 3rd floor

955
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:48,010
Enter from the rear
and retrieve her phone, okay?

956
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,837
Hey Thiru!

957
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:41,916
Hey Thiru!

958
00:59:41,956 --> 00:59:44,716
I'm throwing a 'dhoti'
Hold on to it

959
00:59:46,273 --> 00:59:47,755
Pull it...pull hard

960
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:48,832
'Hey! Don't let go'

961
00:59:48,912 --> 00:59:50,073
'Hold tight'

962
00:59:50,111 --> 00:59:51,315
Hold on to it real tight

963
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:52,553
'That's the 3rd floor!'

964
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:54,832
- That's it
- Hey, that isn't Sara's room

965
00:59:57,113 --> 00:59:58,552
Aiyaiyo!

966
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,471
Who the hell are you?
I am the local MLA!

967
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:02,070
- Why did you jump in?
- Mistake, sir

968
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:03,713
Maa TV channel reporter?

969
01:00:03,752 --> 01:00:05,752
Will you telecast through satellite?

970
01:00:08,949 --> 01:00:10,071
Hug him

971
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,631
Hug him tight

972
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,950
Hug tight

973
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,427
Kiss him

974
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:17,068
Take him to the bed...roll over

975
01:00:17,269 --> 01:00:18,308
Hold him closer

976
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,507
"Hug him, hug him tight"

977
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:23,268
"Darling, hold him close in delight"

978
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:27,945
I told you to just act
and you're taking it so seriously

979
01:00:28,066 --> 01:00:29,547
You and this girl

980
01:00:29,587 --> 01:00:31,868
...are too close for comfort
in this video in my mobile

981
01:00:31,906 --> 01:00:35,186
I dare you to telecast
my video through satellite

982
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:37,826
- I don't want to dare!
- Hey, don't push

983
01:00:37,904 --> 01:00:39,345
'I'll shoot you with this gun'

984
01:00:39,387 --> 01:00:40,823
'There is no bullets in that gun'

985
01:00:40,862 --> 01:00:41,905
No bullet?

986
01:00:41,946 --> 01:00:43,865
I paid for you and
you'll take off with him?

987
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:45,185
NAB HIM!

989
01:00:56,022 --> 01:01:01,021
"Hey mamu...machan...dude, my dear
He is caught, no way out I fear"

990
01:01:01,102 --> 01:01:06,058
"Hey buddy...machan...in a mess
He is in a soup, no way out, I guess"

991
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:11,020
"He is looking for a tonsured head urgently
in the temple on the seven hills, Tirupati"

992
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:15,979
"In Palani temple he's searching vigorously
for a man anointed with sacred ash piously"

993
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,977
"Hey mamu...machan...dude, my dear
He is caught, no way out I fear"

994
01:01:21,016 --> 01:01:26,377
"Hey buddy...machan...in a mess
He is in a soup, no way out, I guess"

995
01:01:45,252 --> 01:01:47,294
Don't I look super in this silk saree?

996
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:49,050
I am ready for the wedding!

997
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:57,685
'Hey, who is it?'

998
01:02:04,966 --> 01:02:06,366
'Oh...door!'

999
01:02:23,479 --> 01:02:24,481
Excuse me

1000
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:27,122
Move aside

1001
01:02:28,163 --> 01:02:29,599
Hey! Move
Excuse me

1002
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:32,121
Phone!

1003
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,481
Hey...who are you?

1004
01:02:34,521 --> 01:02:35,880
Hey, let go of me

1005
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,801
Hey! Leave me
Who are you?

1006
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:39,478
Answer me...hey!

1007
01:02:42,237 --> 01:02:43,520
Bloody thief!

1008
01:02:43,757 --> 01:02:46,758
If my lover Thiru catches you,
he will slice you to bits

1009
01:02:51,638 --> 01:02:53,758
"He has stuck 'fevicol'
on to a tiger's tail"

1010
01:02:53,798 --> 01:02:56,357
"Stuck his head perilously
into a rat-trap precariously"

1011
01:02:56,395 --> 01:02:58,994
"Blew a conch lying waste
for his funeral in haste"

1012
01:02:59,034 --> 01:03:01,794
"With his own money he cast a spell
stupidly on himself to go to hell"

1013
01:03:01,914 --> 01:03:04,235
"Within string hoppers now
he is entangled somehow"

1014
01:03:04,276 --> 01:03:06,752
"Hailing many a bad omen
he sent a text to Saturn"

1015
01:03:06,793 --> 01:03:11,193
"Hands tied, he jumped into the sea
Blindfolded he jay-walked wildly"

1016
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:13,671
"In his friendship however
In his drunken stupor"

1017
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:16,671
"All his fault, in a cycle's gap rashly
He got caught, this son-in-law to be"

1018
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:21,790
"Fully to blame, in a hair's breath brashly
He got caught, this son-in-law to be"

1019
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:30,709
"Hey mamu...machan...dude, my dear
He is caught, no way out I fear"

1020
01:03:30,788 --> 01:03:35,708
"Hey buddy...machan...in a mess
He is in a soup, no way out, I guess"

1021
01:03:35,788 --> 01:03:40,706
"He is looking for a tonsured head urgently
in the temple on the seven hills, Tirupati"

1022
01:03:40,745 --> 01:03:45,667
"In Palani temple he's searching vigorously
for a man anointed with sacred ash piously"

1023
01:03:45,703 --> 01:03:50,787
"Hey mamu...machan...dude, my dear
He is caught, no way out I fear"

1024
01:03:50,825 --> 01:03:56,662
"Hey buddy...machan...in a mess
He is in a soup, no way out, I guess"

1025
01:03:57,142 --> 01:03:58,820
- Thiru, where are you?
- I'm running

1026
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,821
- Why are you running?
- Jogging

1027
01:04:00,982 --> 01:04:02,459
Jogging at 1:00 p.m?

1028
01:04:02,498 --> 01:04:03,578
Forget that
Listen to me

1029
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,777
A room boy came
and stole my phone

1030
01:04:05,816 --> 01:04:07,979
Th...thief...must be dangerous

1031
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:09,819
- Don't run behind him
- Hey, no way

1032
01:04:09,857 --> 01:04:12,136
'My phone has many
important messages'

1033
01:04:12,178 --> 01:04:13,978
Tell me about it!
Did you see him?

1034
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:16,817
He covered his face
with a lamp shade

1035
01:04:19,095 --> 01:04:20,897
- Now?
- What do you mean 'now'?

1036
01:04:20,938 --> 01:04:22,776
Now go and take rest
I'll handle him

1037
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,415
No, I'll lodge a complaint

1038
01:04:24,457 --> 01:04:25,935
What nonsense, I say!

1039
01:04:25,975 --> 01:04:27,937
Call your GM
I'll complain to the police

1040
01:04:27,978 --> 01:04:29,657
No chance of theft in our hotel

1041
01:04:29,697 --> 01:04:31,655
- Check once again
- Attend to it

1042
01:04:31,694 --> 01:04:33,776
You aren't getting
water in the taps either, huh?

1043
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:35,574
Some chap stole Sara's cell phone

1044
01:04:35,614 --> 01:04:37,974
Do they steal even slippers
in such a big hotel?

1045
01:04:38,052 --> 01:04:39,294
- Aiyo!
- Security

1046
01:04:39,373 --> 01:04:41,733
- Check all the staff
- Yes, sir

1047
01:04:41,813 --> 01:04:45,011
'I have found a way
to catch the cell phone thief'

1048
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,613
'Come quickly to the 3rd floor'

1049
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:48,693
What is happening here, dad?

1050
01:04:48,892 --> 01:04:51,691
The 3 employees working
in 3rd floor in this shift

1051
01:04:51,731 --> 01:04:53,572
They aren't confessing
who took the phone

1052
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:57,570
Take them to the police station
and pound them to a pulp

1053
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:58,651
The thief will be caught

1054
01:04:58,692 --> 01:05:02,051
Standing face to face, why are you
talking to each other over the phone?

1055
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:03,728
He is very naive, son

1056
01:05:03,808 --> 01:05:06,570
If they are handed over to the police,
can't we find the phone thief?

1057
01:05:06,648 --> 01:05:07,765
Where did you find her, pa?

1058
01:05:07,808 --> 01:05:09,129
I can't take his any longer

1059
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:10,765
Thiru, call me from your phone

1060
01:05:10,805 --> 01:05:12,168
- Fast
- Right now

1061
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:14,087
- I'm dialling
- Give it to me

1062
01:05:14,648 --> 01:05:16,285
Why trouble yourself, when I am there

1063
01:05:16,324 --> 01:05:17,565
Don't talk...dial

1064
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,564
'Dubai Raja!'

1065
01:05:21,845 --> 01:05:23,883
"Hoax humbug bamboozle"

1066
01:05:25,205 --> 01:05:27,406
"Con game...sham...swindle"

1067
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:30,683
Don't keep staring at me
Think clearly...think

1068
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,960
"Farce...fraud...forgery
False...feign...fakery"

1069
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:44,043
"Bluff...bunco...bogus
Dodge and doublecross"

1070
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,080
"Racket...trick...treachery
Ruse...scam...chicanery"

1071
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:48,400
"Hoax humbug bamboozle"

1072
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,560
"Con game...sham...swindle"

1073
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,198
Phone is switched off
How will the thief be here?

1074
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,322
He would've escaped at once
Is this such a big deal?

1075
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,838
Of course, it is a big deal!

1076
01:05:58,919 --> 01:06:00,517
This is a prestige issue
for our family

1077
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,156
'Laddu' issue made us lose face

1078
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:04,118
I won't let go of this issue
Action has to be tak-

1079
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,236
Sir, lunch ready

1080
01:06:06,955 --> 01:06:08,153
We'll discuss this after lunch

1081
01:06:08,193 --> 01:06:09,637
Good idea
Let's eat

1082
01:06:11,112 --> 01:06:12,351
You can disperse

1083
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,672
Machan, super
Give me the phone

1084
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:20,070
When I missed a catch in cricket
you'll knock me on my head

1085
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:26,429
Didn't you catch the phone?

1086
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,592
As usual I missed the catch

1087
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:32,309
When I came down
it was missing

1088
01:06:32,349 --> 01:06:33,748
Stand right there

1089
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:34,790
I'll clobbe-

1090
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,149
Sir, are you here?

1091
01:06:36,189 --> 01:06:37,908
I stole an uniform
from Housekeeping

1092
01:06:37,947 --> 01:06:40,227
- Will you pay me?
- I'm bugged the mobile is missing

1093
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:41,308
Mobile missing?

1094
01:06:41,346 --> 01:06:44,068
Sir, go to King mobiles
to trace stolen mobile

1095
01:06:44,108 --> 01:06:45,906
You can surely get it, sir

1096
01:06:46,225 --> 01:06:47,425
We'll get it?

1097
01:06:47,464 --> 01:06:48,586
He says we'll get it

1098
01:06:50,024 --> 01:06:53,423
[Song from 'Arya 2]

1099
01:07:03,464 --> 01:07:05,464
- Sara's phone, thank god
- Give it

1100
01:07:05,504 --> 01:07:07,224
1st let's delete the message

1101
01:07:07,703 --> 01:07:09,942
This iPhone is i6 model

1102
01:07:10,344 --> 01:07:11,941
It will cost you Rs 30,000

1103
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,981
New phone in this model
is only 20 or 25000

1104
01:07:14,023 --> 01:07:16,298
- Then buy a new one
- This is our phone, man

1105
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:18,098
- Clear off
- Sir

1106
01:07:18,297 --> 01:07:22,217
He wrongly assumed his fiancee
is having an affair and...

1107
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,257
...he sent a wrong message, sir

1108
01:07:24,296 --> 01:07:25,335
Must be truthful

1109
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,660
Truth always triumphs!

1110
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:28,457
Is that girl having another link?

1111
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:31,775
How does she look?
Sooper, huh?

1112
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:32,817
Glam doll, eh?

1113
01:07:32,857 --> 01:07:34,457
Show me the girl, eh?

1114
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:37,497
How dare you!

1115
01:07:37,536 --> 01:07:39,377
- Thiru, come away
- Do you know who I am?

1116
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:41,137
Let me see how you get this phone

1117
01:07:41,176 --> 01:07:42,618
I'll show you my true colors

1118
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:43,893
Sir...sir, please don't

1119
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:47,094
Don't go to Venkateshwara wedding hall
and don't meet the bride Sara, sir!

1120
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:50,771
You brewed up trouble in my area
I won't let you off that easily

1121
01:07:53,256 --> 01:07:54,212
Sorry, sir

1122
01:07:54,933 --> 01:07:56,212
My mistake

1123
01:07:56,732 --> 01:07:58,011
Hit me, I don't mind

1124
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,214
This is a family issue
I will be humiliated

1125
01:08:01,013 --> 01:08:01,933
Please, sir

1126
01:08:01,973 --> 01:08:04,331
You should have
thought of it before hitting me

1127
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:05,572
Sir...sir...sir

1128
01:08:05,613 --> 01:08:07,533
- I'll fall at your feet
- You don't get this

1129
01:08:07,611 --> 01:08:11,171
This will be my wedding gift
to your bride

1130
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:13,091
See you at Venkateswara wedding hall

1131
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,008
Sir...sir...he is a good fellow

1132
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,726
Please sir...sir...please

1133
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,366
- Sir, don't
- Sir, please don't

1134
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:21,006
Hey boys
Come along

1135
01:10:19,946 --> 01:10:21,986
Hey Thiru, don't
Listen to me

1136
01:10:22,027 --> 01:10:23,585
He might pop off
Come away

1137
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:36,368
Our video message to Sara
didn't even get delivered

1138
01:10:36,407 --> 01:10:37,809
Check in your phone

1139
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,806
It has been delivered
See, blue tick

1140
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:45,284
Someone is calling

1141
01:10:46,203 --> 01:10:48,161
Sara's phone is with us

1142
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:49,884
But Sara is calling us!

1143
01:10:49,922 --> 01:10:51,803
Why hesitate?
Go ahead, talk

1144
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:54,321
Dai! Thiru

1145
01:10:54,361 --> 01:10:56,040
'Dai', huh?
This isn't her voice

1146
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,600
Respect is on the decline too

1147
01:10:57,642 --> 01:10:59,079
This is Saara here, da

1148
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:00,998
Psychology Saara, da

1149
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:02,439
'I love you'

1150
01:11:02,559 --> 01:11:07,358
I've stored my name and #
for you to send me this snap

1151
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:10,279
Look, Saara

1152
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:12,157
Our Sara is S-a-r-a

1153
01:11:12,198 --> 01:11:14,516
This is 'psychology' Sara, huh?

1154
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:20,155
In your drunken state you've sent
the video meant for our Sara to this Saara

1155
01:11:21,795 --> 01:11:23,556
- I won't
- Come here

1156
01:11:23,596 --> 01:11:25,355
I know you'll hit me

1157
01:11:25,516 --> 01:11:27,035
I won't hit, da
I'll hug you

1158
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,433
Hug, huh?

1159
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,074
I'm so embarrassed

1160
01:11:38,113 --> 01:11:40,753
'Psychology' is waiting
on the line, talk to her

1161
01:11:47,392 --> 01:11:48,511
Saara, how is life?

1162
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:50,549
You ruined my life, da

1163
01:11:51,749 --> 01:11:55,388
Your one single message
ruined my whole life

1164
01:11:56,908 --> 01:12:00,909
'Do you know how happy I was,
with my family on my wedding eve'

1165
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:04,188
'That was when I saw
your video message'

1166
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:05,708
'Hey you! Saara!'

1167
01:12:05,747 --> 01:12:07,869
'I fell flat for you and
chased you night and day'

1168
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:09,944
'But you want a man a day!'

1169
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,825
Sara, I hate you

1170
01:12:11,865 --> 01:12:15,183
You want a 2nd hand, 3rd hand,
4th hand, 5th hand, huh?

1171
01:12:16,264 --> 01:12:19,423
'My wedding got called off
because of your video message'

1172
01:12:19,864 --> 01:12:21,582
'My dad is an ex-military man'

1173
01:12:21,663 --> 01:12:23,263
I won't forgive you

1174
01:12:23,303 --> 01:12:26,142
When I was young and
I went with you on any hunt

1175
01:12:26,182 --> 01:12:29,662
...whatever the animal
you'll ask me to shoot it

1176
01:12:30,382 --> 01:12:32,542
Ages since I went on a hunting spree

1177
01:12:44,058 --> 01:12:46,619
Dude, this is just a toy gun

1178
01:12:48,259 --> 01:12:49,659
Oh my God!

1179
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:55,934
Suppose I sent this video message
you sent me, to your bride

1180
01:12:55,975 --> 01:12:58,334
I swear you won't hear trumpets or drums

1181
01:12:58,373 --> 01:13:00,654
You'll hear only a conch
blowing at your funeral!

1182
01:13:01,172 --> 01:13:02,333
Shut up!

1183
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:06,252
We are not nitwits
to fall for any story of yours

1184
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,612
We are smart enough to know

1185
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:10,370
...a conch doesn't sound like that

1186
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,688
This is its real sound

1187
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:17,769
Statue!

1188
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:19,970
I told you repeatedly

1189
01:13:20,969 --> 01:13:23,849
She's a good girl and
don't hide anything from her

1190
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,009
- Shall I tell her?
- Huh?

1191
01:13:26,049 --> 01:13:27,568
Okay, I'll handle this

1192
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:30,167
Thiru

1193
01:13:30,326 --> 01:13:31,688
Loves you intensely

1194
01:13:31,727 --> 01:13:33,049
Aiyaiyo!

1195
01:13:36,327 --> 01:13:38,127
When you professed
your love that day

1196
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:39,725
...did you notice his reaction?

1197
01:13:40,846 --> 01:13:42,365
'There are 1000s of men around'

1198
01:13:42,405 --> 01:13:43,967
'Why make a beeline to me?'

1199
01:13:45,324 --> 01:13:47,286
'There are 1000s of men around'

1200
01:13:47,484 --> 01:13:49,721
'Why make a beeline to me?'

1201
01:13:54,161 --> 01:13:55,999
'Why are you torturing me?'

1202
01:13:56,839 --> 01:13:59,239
'Why do you torture me like this?'

1203
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,039
'He loves me so intensely, huh?'

1204
01:14:03,599 --> 01:14:06,318
Daiiiii! You can't hide true love

1205
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,517
This is the only way to
escape from her, please, dude

1206
01:14:09,517 --> 01:14:11,439
In this issue alone
Dubai seems to be right

1207
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:14,117
Simply nod your head
We'll handle the rest, okay?

1208
01:14:15,955 --> 01:14:16,916
I'll just nod my head

1209
01:14:16,954 --> 01:14:18,395
We can manage the rest

1210
01:14:18,437 --> 01:14:19,637
Just accept the truth

1211
01:14:19,676 --> 01:14:23,916
You couldn't reciprocate, only because
your parents fixed another bride for you

1212
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,716
'Is that why he sent that video?'

1213
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:28,593
Tell her that's why
to stop her wedding

1214
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:30,834
...you hardened yourself
and sent that video

1215
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:31,875
Nod your head

1216
01:14:35,552 --> 01:14:37,232
She's falling for our fib

1217
01:14:37,275 --> 01:14:40,954
Instead of deriding me
and expressing your love indirectly

1218
01:14:40,992 --> 01:14:44,113
...you could have sent a straight
'I love you' message, right?

1219
01:14:44,194 --> 01:14:47,111
Listen we can explain
only messages that have been sent

1220
01:14:47,153 --> 01:14:49,233
If you ask something new
we'll be in a fix

1221
01:14:49,834 --> 01:14:51,792
You have another
shocking piece of news

1222
01:14:51,871 --> 01:14:52,947
What?

1223
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:55,067
You'll be zapped if you hear it

1224
01:14:55,546 --> 01:14:57,507
Hey! Where are you running off to?

1225
01:14:57,546 --> 01:14:58,987
He's feeling shy!

1226
01:14:59,184 --> 01:15:00,347
Love!!

1227
01:15:02,864 --> 01:15:04,067
Thiru, come here

1228
01:15:04,107 --> 01:15:06,904
If you make a mistake
you shouldn't hide, face the problem

1229
01:15:06,946 --> 01:15:09,626
His bride-to-be
already has a lover

1230
01:15:09,825 --> 01:15:11,105
Raja...!

1231
01:15:11,626 --> 01:15:12,744
Don't start crying

1232
01:15:13,344 --> 01:15:14,461
Isn't it a fact?

1233
01:15:15,584 --> 01:15:19,502
We are calling him this evening
and uniting him with Thiru's bride-to-be

1234
01:15:19,542 --> 01:15:20,782
Tomorrow

1235
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:22,262
Both of you

1236
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:23,902
Be happy
That's all

1237
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:27,502
Thiru, you must be really blessed
to get friends like this

1238
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:28,541
Din it into his head

1239
01:15:28,582 --> 01:15:30,299
'One who walks till the very end is friend'

1240
01:15:30,501 --> 01:15:33,060
Why are you silent?

1241
01:15:44,978 --> 01:15:46,458
Our clothes match
Same pinch!

1242
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:47,696
Pinch-u!

1243
01:15:49,896 --> 01:15:51,176
I too love you!

1244
01:15:52,935 --> 01:15:56,215
'Actually the 1st time I set eyes on you
I liked you very much'

1245
01:15:57,096 --> 01:16:00,573
I never dreamt the words I professed for
a psychology test will come true today

1246
01:16:00,614 --> 01:16:03,771
'How much you should love me
to send such a bold video'

1247
01:16:03,813 --> 01:16:05,253
'...and cancel my wedding'

1248
01:16:10,373 --> 01:16:12,011
Is she the bride?

1249
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:16,252
She looks like a palm fruit seller
at the tollgate?

1250
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:21,770
His boyfriend must be
a guava seller for sure

1251
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:25,488
Go and tell her she can find
her boyfriend soon

1252
01:16:30,528 --> 01:16:32,610
You are suspecting me
of being unfaithful, right?

1253
01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:34,088
You should be suspicious

1254
01:16:34,608 --> 01:16:37,767
You should ask me who she is
and why I hugged her?

1255
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:39,327
And I owe you an answer!

1256
01:16:39,446 --> 01:16:40,487
Why did you hug her?

1257
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,726
You shouldn't ask at once

1258
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,565
We should think
with foresight

1259
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:45,326
What should I think?

1260
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,726
Where are your friends?

1261
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:48,846
She's my friend's younger sister

1262
01:16:48,885 --> 01:16:50,523
Why is he blabbering?

1263
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:51,806
- Thiru!
- Thiru, ah?

1264
01:16:51,846 --> 01:16:53,564
She is from Tirunelveli

1265
01:16:53,885 --> 01:16:55,045
Aiyo!

1266
01:16:55,084 --> 01:16:56,123
AIYO!

1267
01:16:56,202 --> 01:16:57,484
Aiyaiyo!

1268
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:00,522
Oh God! Some chap has
cheated her and absconded

1269
01:17:00,564 --> 01:17:01,679
Cheated her?

1270
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,277
I feel like puking when I see her

1271
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,680
If a man cheats a girl
naturally she will puke

1272
01:17:05,718 --> 01:17:07,118
If she has conceived!

1273
01:17:07,157 --> 01:17:09,398
Why are you behaving
like a mental patient?

1274
01:17:09,476 --> 01:17:12,477
Affected by this, she has
become mentally deranged

1275
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:15,236
She says, 'hug me, marry me'
to every random chap she meets

1276
01:17:15,276 --> 01:17:18,597
I'm her brother's friend and instead of
considering me as her bro too...

1277
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:20,315
...she wants me to marry her

1278
01:17:20,675 --> 01:17:22,434
This is the state I am in and you-

1279
01:17:25,276 --> 01:17:26,754
I lost my temper, Sara

1280
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:31,154
You feel so bad
for your friend's sister

1281
01:17:31,233 --> 01:17:32,475
You're really great!

1282
01:17:35,913 --> 01:17:38,433
Hello! Watch your step
You may slip into the water

1283
01:17:38,472 --> 01:17:41,633
I was about to slip
Thiru saved me in the nick of time

1284
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,512
I am bonkers about him

1285
01:17:43,553 --> 01:17:47,031
True, Thiru told me
you've gone bonkers!

1286
01:17:47,071 --> 01:17:49,433
I came with a gun to shoot Thiru

1287
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:50,990
- Then?
- But

1288
01:17:51,032 --> 01:17:52,949
Thiru shot me!

1289
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:55,672
I love you, Thiru

1290
01:17:55,711 --> 01:17:57,111
I want to marry you

1291
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:59,906
'Poor thing! Lunatic
Blabbering away to glory'

1292
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:02,829
Dad, I intend marrying Thiru

1293
01:18:02,869 --> 01:18:05,147
Thiru, I want to marry you

1294
01:18:33,662 --> 01:18:37,302
"Love at first sight?
Don't kick a fuss, alright?"

1295
01:18:37,302 --> 01:18:41,060
"I came in right earnest
to unite with you, my dearest"

1296
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:51,219
"O' rooster cock-a-doodle-doo
Hen's guardian, is it so?"

1297
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:54,702
"You are part of our team; rhapsody
Tap your feet to zap everybody"

1298
01:18:54,740 --> 01:19:01,660
"I want to marry you, my beau"

1299
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:08,496
"I want to marry you
My love so true"

1300
01:19:08,815 --> 01:19:11,890
"Love at first sight?
Don't create a scene, alright?"

1301
01:19:11,973 --> 01:19:15,692
"I came in right earnest
to merge with you, my dearest"

1302
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:22,690
"I want to marry you, my beau"

1303
01:19:22,732 --> 01:19:29,648
"I want to marry you
My love so true"

1304
01:19:57,445 --> 01:20:04,603
"Don't we get to see the teaser
before the film plays in the theater?"

1305
01:20:04,643 --> 01:20:10,882
"Before we get married with rituals holy
shall we go on a honeymoon jolly?"

1306
01:20:10,922 --> 01:20:14,318
"You are trying to lure me
with all this messed up analogy"

1307
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,958
"Before I can tie a knot properly
you are putting me in a quandary"

1308
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:21,318
"I'm a vehicle that can speed up
in a jiffy to the mountain top"

1309
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,477
"Why are you not starting readily?
But hobbling on 1 foot unsteadily"

1310
01:20:25,517 --> 01:20:31,795
"I want to marry you, my beau"

1311
01:20:32,478 --> 01:20:39,557
"I want to marry you
My love so true"

1312
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:07,431
"If you hold my hand, it's breakfast, dear"

1313
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:10,670
"A kiss becomes a 3 course meal clear"

1314
01:21:10,748 --> 01:21:13,668
"If you hug me
it's 'biriyani' yummy"

1315
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:17,265
"If you want this, dude
boldly ask me to include"

1316
01:21:17,308 --> 01:21:20,584
"Before you've cooked your treat
Baby, don't spread your feast"

1317
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:24,264
"With your temerity, don't offer me
a gourmet meal half cooked only"

1318
01:21:24,304 --> 01:21:27,545
"I am exclusive treacle toffee
Come close and take a bite tasty"

1319
01:21:27,663 --> 01:21:31,783
"Now is a power outage, my dear
Have your fill and satisfy your desire"

1320
01:21:31,823 --> 01:21:38,659
"I want to marry you, my beau"

1321
01:21:38,702 --> 01:21:45,499
"I want to marry you
My love so true"

1322
01:21:45,537 --> 01:21:49,219
"Love at first sight?
Don't kick a fuss, alright?"

1323
01:21:49,259 --> 01:21:52,659
"I came in right earnest
to unite with you, my dearest"

1324
01:21:52,697 --> 01:21:59,617
"I want to marry you, my beau"

1325
01:21:59,657 --> 01:22:06,538
"I want to marry you
My love so true"

1326
01:22:06,538 --> 01:22:13,855
"I want to marry you, my beau"

1327
01:22:21,254 --> 01:22:23,171
'She shows her gun
at the least excuse!'

1328
01:22:30,689 --> 01:22:31,689
Come on

1329
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:33,250
Give me a hand

1330
01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:34,290
Come, I say

1331
01:22:34,331 --> 01:22:37,729
"Hoax humbug bamboozle"

1332
01:22:44,849 --> 01:22:48,446
"Con game...sham...swindle"

1333
01:22:48,486 --> 01:22:50,805
Going overboard because of
the message in your phone

1334
01:22:50,845 --> 01:22:52,167
Hurry up

1335
01:22:52,246 --> 01:22:53,766
Look what I'll do now

1336
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:56,044
Our turn now to
send her to her grave!

1337
01:23:00,165 --> 01:23:02,084
Give me my cell phone

1338
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:03,724
I want my phone back

1339
01:23:04,003 --> 01:23:05,084
Give the phone

1340
01:23:05,844 --> 01:23:07,524
- Where is Thiru?
- Saara?

1341
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:10,364
Anger flashes in her eyes
like Jhansi Rani

1342
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:12,281
Courage in her fingers
like Phoolan Devi

1343
01:23:12,324 --> 01:23:14,122
Energy in her stride
like Naachiyaar

1344
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:17,324
Anger magnified as in Arakkonam

1345
01:23:17,364 --> 01:23:22,440
If you delete a message from
a girl's phone without her knowledge

1346
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,319
...this was a litmus test
to see your reaction!

1347
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,077
Wow!

1348
01:23:28,315 --> 01:23:29,838
Superb!

1349
01:23:30,035 --> 01:23:31,756
Do you like my bravery?

1350
01:23:32,877 --> 01:23:34,434
This is child's play

1351
01:23:34,474 --> 01:23:35,755
I know 'Varma' too

1352
01:23:35,795 --> 01:23:37,076
Ram Gopal Varma?

1353
01:23:37,115 --> 01:23:39,153
No, Indian martial arts

1354
01:23:42,716 --> 01:23:44,235
- 'Maro'
- Mama!

1355
01:23:44,276 --> 01:23:45,313
'I am here'

1356
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,633
Hello maro

1357
01:23:47,274 --> 01:23:49,433
- Uncle
- We didn't call them here

1358
01:23:49,474 --> 01:23:50,514
You too Brutus, huh?

1359
01:23:50,555 --> 01:23:53,192
Thiru, I love you

1360
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:13,548
Why aren't you telling me?

1361
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:15,229
- She's mad it seems
- I'm mad, huh?

1362
01:24:15,269 --> 01:24:16,549
You're mad, so is your mother

1363
01:24:16,587 --> 01:24:18,107
- And your father
- She has heard you

1364
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:19,147
Okay...go

1365
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:21,508
We are going to the wedding hall

1366
01:24:21,748 --> 01:24:23,269
Okay, bye

1367
01:24:23,746 --> 01:24:26,626
Given a chance
looks like you'll marry her

1368
01:24:26,664 --> 01:24:28,828
- Where is her lover?
- We are still searching

1369
01:24:28,866 --> 01:24:29,864
Somewhere here

1370
01:24:29,907 --> 01:24:32,264
He has to be here by 6:00 p.m

1371
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:33,503
If he doesn't?

1372
01:24:33,584 --> 01:24:35,862
I'll forward the message
and stop the wedding

1373
01:24:58,178 --> 01:24:59,259
Thiru

1374
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:02,179
From the beginning
I wanted this wedding to be called off

1375
01:25:02,179 --> 01:25:05,817
But we successfully
got 99 couple married

1376
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,577
How can so many issues
crop up in your wedding?

1377
01:25:08,816 --> 01:25:11,094
Instead of lying so many times
to hide one single lie

1378
01:25:11,136 --> 01:25:13,777
...let's tell Sara
the whole truth

1379
01:25:13,816 --> 01:25:15,698
She'll definitely forgive you

1380
01:25:15,816 --> 01:25:21,696
"Love is just like a pane of glass
How will it stick once it breaks, o' lass?"

1381
01:25:21,734 --> 01:25:27,614
"How will the fishes in the sea
swim on the ground, tell me?"

1382
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:33,490
"Love is like a mirror, dear
Once broken how can the shards adhere?"

1383
01:25:33,571 --> 01:25:39,331
"How will the fishes in the sea
swim on the ground, tell me?"

1384
01:25:39,368 --> 01:25:44,409
"Will we get yesterday
once more today?"

1385
01:25:44,887 --> 01:25:50,368
"Can we forget the days
we spent in blissful ways?"

1386
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:57,046
"Love is just like a pane of glass
How will it stick once it breaks, o' lass?"

1387
01:25:57,126 --> 01:26:02,964
"How will the fishes in the sea
swim on the ground, tell me?"

1388
01:26:03,006 --> 01:26:09,724
"Love is like a mirror, dear
Once broken how can the shards adhere?"

1389
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,801
Sara's room?

1390
01:26:31,961 --> 01:26:33,238
Sara's classmate, huh?

1391
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,838
Welcome

1392
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:37,078
Go straight and turn left

1393
01:26:48,915 --> 01:26:50,636
I'm from King Mobiles

1394
01:26:52,394 --> 01:26:53,793
What can I do for you?

1395
01:27:18,869 --> 01:27:22,509
Will you believe if someone tells you
your mother's milk had poison?

1396
01:27:23,591 --> 01:27:25,748
That's the analogy for saying
Thiru suspects me

1397
01:27:25,789 --> 01:27:31,546
"If flowers go on suspicious mode
petals will wither with heads bowed"

1398
01:27:31,587 --> 01:27:37,465
"Even the 'Bodhi' peepal tree here
will turn to firewood fruitlessly, dear"

1399
01:27:37,506 --> 01:27:43,424
"A journey can't be undertaken
without ups and downs uneven"

1400
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:49,381
"No love on earth is possible
if separation and reunion not feasible"

1401
01:27:49,422 --> 01:27:55,260
"Love is just like a pane of glass
How will it stick once it breaks, o' lass"

1402
01:27:55,301 --> 01:28:01,178
"How will the fishes in the sea
swim on the ground, tell me?"

1403
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:07,977
"Love is like a mirror, dear
Once broken how can the shards adhere?"

1404
01:28:10,257 --> 01:28:12,537
We can somehow manage
if she suspects you

1405
01:28:12,656 --> 01:28:14,017
She trusts you

1406
01:28:14,296 --> 01:28:16,015
I don't know what I'll do

1407
01:28:16,054 --> 01:28:18,656
If Sara knows the truth
she will die, I say

1408
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:21,217
If this Saara knows
she will kill you!

1409
01:28:21,456 --> 01:28:23,055
Only 2 more hours for the function

1410
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:24,736
Before that, Sara's lover-

1411
01:28:24,776 --> 01:28:27,335
The lover who jilted her
as per our story, find a real one

1412
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:28,814
The truth will be out afterwards

1413
01:28:28,854 --> 01:28:29,974
We'll cross the bridge later

1414
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,212
We have to deal with this now

1415
01:28:31,255 --> 01:28:33,175
This is the only way
to perform this wedding

1416
01:28:33,213 --> 01:28:35,614
Because we have all made
such a big blunder

1417
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:39,615
You made me hunt for a lover
for my own lady love!

1418
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:42,571
'Come...come, bro'

1419
01:28:42,612 --> 01:28:44,530
We'll find a guy, cool

1420
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:47,012
'Come...it's clear'

1421
01:28:47,051 --> 01:28:48,528
'Come...come'

1422
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:50,249
'Isn't he 'Bullet' Pushparaj?'

1423
01:28:50,287 --> 01:28:51,727
'In disguise now'

1424
01:28:51,769 --> 01:28:53,926
The vegetable load is here

1425
01:28:53,968 --> 01:28:55,366
Come...no problem

1426
01:28:55,407 --> 01:28:57,328
Ah! Come...no prob-

1427
01:28:57,648 --> 01:29:01,926
'He rinsed me dry that day
Today he'll fold and iron my creases!'

1428
01:29:01,967 --> 01:29:05,367
Come...welcome

1429
01:29:06,488 --> 01:29:08,885
He couldn't see through my disguise!

1430
01:29:12,205 --> 01:29:15,604
Bro, what dessert do you want?
'Payasam' or 'Halwa'?

1431
01:29:17,445 --> 01:29:19,604
Bro, I beg of you
Forgive me

1432
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:21,803
I kept calling my bike as 'wifey'

1433
01:29:21,843 --> 01:29:25,084
Because I didn't pay the dues
for my bike, he took my wife away!

1434
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:28,684
My father-in-law who heard about it
hired killers to close my chapter

1435
01:29:28,723 --> 01:29:32,083
That's why I'm roaming around
in this disguise, save me please

1436
01:29:32,123 --> 01:29:34,280
I'll get your bike and wife back

1437
01:29:34,322 --> 01:29:37,482
Will you nod your head for whatever I say
without asking me questions?

1438
01:29:43,481 --> 01:29:45,120
Thiru Weds Sara

1439
01:29:45,161 --> 01:29:47,237
'It should be S-double a-r-a

1440
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:49,036
'Must tell them to change the spelling'

1441
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:58,633
'Where is Sara's lover?
They said they found him'

1442
01:30:00,513 --> 01:30:01,634
- Success!
- Who is he?

1443
01:30:01,634 --> 01:30:03,633
Sara's real lover

1444
01:30:04,713 --> 01:30:06,311
This man, huh?

1445
01:30:06,351 --> 01:30:08,355
Looks like a cotton candy seller in a fair

1446
01:30:08,355 --> 01:30:09,433
Brother?

1447
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,830
He's too good
for Sara's face!

1448
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:13,791
Brother!

1449
01:30:13,832 --> 01:30:16,390
She's deriding your girlfriend
and you're keeping quiet?

1450
01:30:17,549 --> 01:30:19,709
Madam, my lady love Sara is...

1451
01:30:19,749 --> 01:30:21,992
...as cool as 'kulfi' ice cream

1452
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:23,830
As fresh and tempting as tomato

1453
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:25,869
Like papaya shining bright and-

1454
01:30:25,907 --> 01:30:28,189
You hit me if I speak
and hit me again if I don't

1455
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,068
You too, huh?

1456
01:30:31,109 --> 01:30:33,666
If you fall in love
you should be steadfast till the end

1457
01:30:33,748 --> 01:30:35,547
You shouldn't pledge her to someone

1458
01:30:35,629 --> 01:30:38,308
Not pledge
It was just a loan

1459
01:30:38,387 --> 01:30:39,786
- Loan?
- Financier

1460
01:30:39,828 --> 01:30:41,307
A loan

1461
01:30:41,948 --> 01:30:43,027
Alone

1462
01:30:43,068 --> 01:30:46,028
He's saying 'alone' meaning
spending time with his girlfriend

1463
01:30:46,067 --> 01:30:47,067
Yes, boss

1464
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,067
Thiru

1465
01:30:48,185 --> 01:30:49,945
Don't know what soup
he'll land me in

1466
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,183
Why did you hit me now?

1467
01:30:51,224 --> 01:30:52,985
Is it enough if you just feel?

1468
01:30:53,062 --> 01:30:54,745
- Who is Sara?
- Who?

1469
01:30:54,785 --> 01:30:56,302
- Your wife
- Oh!

1470
01:30:56,345 --> 01:30:59,061
Shouldn't you have taken her
in your bike by now?

1471
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,420
He took away my wife
instead of my bike

1472
01:31:02,461 --> 01:31:03,939
Was she taken away?

1473
01:31:03,981 --> 01:31:05,461
He came to take her away

1474
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,580
She must be here
somewhere...hahn!

1475
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:08,900
She's here

1476
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:10,181
'Is she also here?'

1477
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:12,179
'Have you started
Bigg Boss Season 3?'

1478
01:31:12,219 --> 01:31:16,418
'Unable to run or hide, I am stuck
between the devil and the deep sea'

1479
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:19,539
Not enough what you got
in Kumbakonam, huh?

1480
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,419
Brother?

1481
01:31:20,457 --> 01:31:22,337
What did she give you in Kumbakonam?

1482
01:31:25,816 --> 01:31:28,018
You ran away petrified that day

1483
01:31:28,095 --> 01:31:29,256
You're so gutsy today

1484
01:31:29,295 --> 01:31:30,775
That's the speciality of love!

1485
01:31:30,897 --> 01:31:33,535
However much we may be mad at
the person we love...

1486
01:31:33,577 --> 01:31:36,454
...when we meet him face to face
it will vanish into thin air

1487
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:37,576
Love, huh?

1488
01:31:37,615 --> 01:31:40,096
Love or love-r?!

1489
01:31:40,373 --> 01:31:43,053
Ohh! Lover!!

1490
01:31:44,293 --> 01:31:45,294
LoveR!

1491
01:31:45,335 --> 01:31:46,535
Yes, lover

1492
01:31:46,574 --> 01:31:48,254
Lover

1493
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:50,174
Lover

1494
01:31:50,933 --> 01:31:55,092
'I am the 1st actor in the world
to act without knowing the scene!'

1495
01:32:03,158 --> 01:32:04,996
Where is that cheater-girl?

1496
01:32:05,037 --> 01:32:06,159
Let's search over there

1497
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:08,075
That 'paniyaram' should puff mor-

1498
01:32:09,517 --> 01:32:10,717
Who are you, madam?

1499
01:32:11,075 --> 01:32:12,315
Er...I am...from

1500
01:32:12,356 --> 01:32:13,514
Groom's side

1501
01:32:13,554 --> 01:32:15,155
'The police is looking for me'

1502
01:32:15,194 --> 01:32:16,596
'This is the ideal place to hide'

1503
01:32:16,634 --> 01:32:17,757
Er...yes

1504
01:32:17,796 --> 01:32:19,715
Are you looking for your husband?

1505
01:32:20,273 --> 01:32:21,874
There...he is my husband

1506
01:32:23,234 --> 01:32:25,675
Oho! Is he your husband?

1507
01:32:25,713 --> 01:32:27,632
Come with me
I'll take you

1508
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:30,552
Let me go, I'll take
the evening bus to Kumbakonam

1509
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:33,511
- Everyone keeps hitting me
- Maro, do you know who this is?

1510
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:37,511
'I saw this female with
that politician in the hotel'

1511
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,470
'Why is she here?'

1512
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,392
He is her husband it seems

1513
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:43,670
Husband, huh?

1514
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:44,952
Husband?

1515
01:32:45,031 --> 01:32:46,269
Uncle

1516
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:47,429
She is-

1517
01:32:47,509 --> 01:32:50,109
If you get me into a fix
I'll crucify you

1518
01:32:51,151 --> 01:32:54,669
Her husband is...this man

1519
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:55,790
I remember only now

1520
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:56,788
Why are you quiet?

1521
01:32:56,828 --> 01:32:57,870
Talk

1522
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,504
Speak up
Open your mouth

1523
01:33:00,547 --> 01:33:01,589
Taaaalk!

1524
01:33:01,589 --> 01:33:04,147
My hometown is Kumbakonam
I am Bullet Pushparajan

1525
01:33:04,189 --> 01:33:06,823
Not that, man
Tell the honest truth!

1526
01:33:06,904 --> 01:33:10,066
Because you lived in her house
for so many years

1527
01:33:10,105 --> 01:33:11,982
With a lot of liberty

1528
01:33:12,022 --> 01:33:14,984
...she calls you her husband
Say it in not a roundabout way

1529
01:33:15,024 --> 01:33:16,744
- I'll tell
- Wait...wait

1530
01:33:17,463 --> 01:33:20,621
If he was just a tenant
how can he become her husband?

1531
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:22,782
'What spark will he light I wonder?'

1532
01:33:22,823 --> 01:33:24,220
How about this?

1533
01:33:24,581 --> 01:33:28,462
She is the house owner
So she implied she is his wife

1534
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:30,939
What do you say, maro?

1535
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:34,098
Why are you crying?

1536
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:37,219
I don't know how to
perform for this scene!

1537
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,779
Come

1538
01:33:41,019 --> 01:33:45,860
1st whistle in a cooker signifies
the rice isn't cooked as yet

1539
01:33:45,898 --> 01:33:48,938
3rd whistle means
the rice is overcooked

1540
01:33:48,979 --> 01:33:53,098
There is a reaction in between
boiled and yet raw, right?

1541
01:33:53,136 --> 01:33:54,897
Flash that expression

1542
01:33:54,937 --> 01:33:57,415
Neither here nor there
I'll do my best, dude

Bring the stool here

You and that lady
in a compromising position

1554
01:34:40,684 --> 01:34:43,002
You've wrongly assumed
I have that video

1555
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:45,324
1 small flash back

1556
01:34:48,084 --> 01:34:49,642
He got nailed, right?

1557
01:34:50,045 --> 01:34:51,684
Hug him
Hug him tight

1558
01:34:51,724 --> 01:34:54,123
This bear seems very familiar

1559
01:34:54,201 --> 01:34:56,042
Yov! it's you!

1560
01:34:56,722 --> 01:34:58,481
- Me, huh?
- Instead of a video of him

1561
01:34:58,521 --> 01:35:00,001
...you took a selfie video instead!

1562
01:35:02,039 --> 01:35:04,683
My post as minister is confirmed

1563
01:35:05,122 --> 01:35:08,638
If you give me that video
I'll be eternally grateful!

01:35:08,918 --> 01:35:11,960
'He who has killed every virtue may flee'

1565
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:16,316
'But one who has forgotten
a good deed can never escape free'

1566
01:35:16,556 --> 01:35:19,393
Tamil poet Valluvar's divine couplet

1567
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,835
You aced it, Thiru
Handled all the issues so well

1568
01:35:21,874 --> 01:35:23,076
Hereafter no-

1569
01:35:23,114 --> 01:35:26,433
If Sara sees you behaving
in such a familiar manner with a girl-

1570
01:35:26,475 --> 01:35:27,915
'Gone case!'

1571
01:35:28,034 --> 01:35:32,475
'Like 'rasam' served on a banana leaf
your problem is running all over the place'

1572
01:35:33,474 --> 01:35:34,993
Are you doubting my love?

1573
01:35:35,954 --> 01:35:37,912
You'll believe if I said
mother's milk has poison?

1574
01:35:37,953 --> 01:35:38,991
Overheard, huh?

1575
01:35:39,032 --> 01:35:41,750
Gold can be scratched to check if genuine
You are breaking it!

1576
01:35:41,791 --> 01:35:43,551
If milk and water is separated-

1577
01:35:43,592 --> 01:35:44,793
Separated?

1578
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:48,592
- Shoved his feet into his mouth!
- Then what happens?

1579
01:35:48,592 --> 01:35:49,791
Why go into all that?

1580
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:51,430
Tell me what's on your mind

1581
01:35:51,469 --> 01:35:56,430
Listen, Thiru, whoever tells me
whatever about you, I will not fall for it

1582
01:35:56,511 --> 01:35:57,312
Good girl

1583
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:59,868
But if you take advantage
of my good nature

1584
01:35:59,908 --> 01:36:02,748
Sara, you're wrong in assuming
Thiru is my girlfriend

1585
01:36:02,789 --> 01:36:04,030
What is he blabbering?

1586
01:36:04,071 --> 01:36:05,269
She's my girlfriend

1587
01:36:05,347 --> 01:36:06,548
Shall I prove it to you?

1588
01:36:06,585 --> 01:36:08,508
Come here, baby
MUAH!

1589
01:36:08,548 --> 01:36:09,747
She didn't hit me!

1590
01:36:09,785 --> 01:36:13,264
I kept quiet for Thiru's sake
Come over there and my show will speak!

1591
01:36:14,865 --> 01:36:16,346
Sorry, Thiru

1592
01:36:17,264 --> 01:36:20,223
If I should accept your apology
you must give me something

1593
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:21,741
Guava?

1594
01:36:22,061 --> 01:36:23,103
Hey!

1595
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:24,902
Aiyaiyo!

1596
01:36:24,941 --> 01:36:26,701
The lip that maligned me

1597
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:30,461
...should go down on its knees
and ask for forgiveness to my lips

1598
01:36:31,699 --> 01:36:34,103
This is called 'leg piece' in English

1599
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:36,180
I mean, lip-kiss!

1600
01:36:44,378 --> 01:36:45,938
No kisses, huh?

1601
01:36:46,257 --> 01:36:47,498
That's okay

1602
01:37:04,334 --> 01:37:07,854
"Hey! My favorite beau
What, my love?"

1603
01:37:07,896 --> 01:37:09,413
"Dude, dapper man
Tell me, woman"

1604
01:37:09,455 --> 01:37:11,892
"My heart throb one and only
My fair lady, tell me"

1605
01:37:14,774 --> 01:37:18,213
"Hey! My handsome beau
Yes, my treasure trove?"

1606
01:37:18,252 --> 01:37:21,689
"Dude, my valentine
Tell me, my love sublime"

1607
01:37:21,731 --> 01:37:25,210
"People are gossiping about you"

1608
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:28,568
"They say '2+2 = 5' my beau!"

1609
01:37:28,608 --> 01:37:32,529
"Our people are maligning you"

1610
01:37:32,568 --> 01:37:36,207
"They say you're up to no good, dude"

1611
01:37:36,246 --> 01:37:39,647
"Hey! My little lassie
Yes, my dear, tell me"

1612
01:37:39,689 --> 01:37:43,207
"My beloved, apple of my eye
Tell me, man who takes me high!"

1613
01:37:43,247 --> 01:37:46,486
"Who spoke ill of me?"

1614
01:37:46,525 --> 01:37:50,082
"What did they say, dearie?"

1615
01:37:50,124 --> 01:37:53,604
"Who ridiculed and condemned me?"

1616
01:37:53,683 --> 01:37:58,086
"What was their complaint, dearie?"

1617
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:22,278
"My love till the very end
What, my dear girlfriend?"

1618
01:38:22,357 --> 01:38:23,837
"My dapper man
Yes, my woman?"

1619
01:38:23,877 --> 01:38:26,713
"My handsome lover
What, my life forever?"

1620
01:38:29,395 --> 01:38:32,633
"Who is Anita of Aandipatti?"

1621
01:38:32,674 --> 01:38:36,434
"This is the gossip in our city"

1622
01:38:36,474 --> 01:38:39,910
"O' my kissing cousin
What, my glow within?"

1623
01:38:39,952 --> 01:38:41,473
"Beautiful girlie
Beau, tell me"

1624
01:38:41,512 --> 01:38:43,512
"My sweet honey
What, tell me?"

1625
01:38:43,592 --> 01:38:46,629
"Anita of Aandipatti is my niece sweetie"

1626
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:50,350
"She is in the 5th grade, all of 10 only"

1627
01:39:25,942 --> 01:39:29,705
"O' my precious love
Yes, my treasure trove"

1628
01:39:29,745 --> 01:39:31,180
"Good gentleman
Yes, my woman"

1629
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:33,542
"Very good gentleman
Fine, tell me, woman"

1630
01:39:36,578 --> 01:39:39,740
"I saw a name listed in your cell phone"

1631
01:39:39,778 --> 01:39:43,699
"Who is that wretched Sathya,
tell me, hon?"

1632
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:47,220
"O' my heart's desire
Yes, my inner fire"

1633
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:48,741
"Dark as ebony love
Heyyyyy!"

1634
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:51,219
"Tresses dark as ebony, my love
My paramour, tell me now"

1635
01:39:51,259 --> 01:39:57,977
"I swear this is the truth, my dear
Sathya, he is my dear friend so sincere"

1636
01:39:58,016 --> 01:40:01,497
"My lover boy steady
Yes, my princess heady"

1637
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,897
"My equal half dance-king
Tell me, my delightful darling"

1638
01:40:04,978 --> 01:40:08,298
"At night, you utter the name 'Devi'"

1639
01:40:08,337 --> 01:40:12,295
"Why do you send me in a jealous tizzy?"

1640
01:40:12,336 --> 01:40:15,415
"My kissing cousin
Yes, my life within"

1641
01:40:15,496 --> 01:40:19,096
"Inside the atrium of my heart
What, sweetheart never to part?"

1642
01:40:19,136 --> 01:40:22,293
"I was thinking of Goddess Karumari Devi"

1643
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:26,295
"I have fixed our wedding date, my lovely"

1644
01:41:06,361 --> 01:41:07,640
Appa?

1645
01:41:07,721 --> 01:41:09,163
Wait, my dear

1646
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,842
Their engagement is
about to take place, dear

1647
01:41:13,319 --> 01:41:14,680
Everyone is watching us

1648
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:16,922
As soon as it is over
I'll get you both married

1649
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:18,520
Come, dear
Please get up

1650
01:41:22,681 --> 01:41:23,880
Look at me, dear

1651
01:41:24,721 --> 01:41:27,157
I am marrying this gentleman

1652
01:41:27,478 --> 01:41:29,920
You are marrying that man

1653
01:41:32,199 --> 01:41:34,237
Are you mad or what?

1654
01:41:34,277 --> 01:41:36,118
He is your husband

1655
01:41:36,197 --> 01:41:37,960
- No
- No, he is your husband

1656
01:41:37,997 --> 01:41:38,954
No, his wife is-

1657
01:41:38,994 --> 01:41:40,194
He is your husband

1658
01:41:40,234 --> 01:41:42,757
NO, HE IS MY HUSBAND!

1659
01:41:46,313 --> 01:41:47,554
PUSHPA...!

1660
01:41:47,554 --> 01:41:49,475
BULLET DARLING!

1661
01:41:49,515 --> 01:41:51,114
My dear elephant
from Kumbakonam

1662
01:41:51,153 --> 01:41:52,671
Kulfi icecream
who came to rescue me

1663
01:41:52,713 --> 01:41:54,954
- My darling
- You haven't showered at all, huh?

1664
01:41:54,993 --> 01:41:56,393
You are covered in dust!

1665
01:41:58,512 --> 01:41:59,951
How did the financier
let you go?

1666
01:41:59,992 --> 01:42:02,071
One look at me
he let me go, dear

1667
01:42:02,112 --> 01:42:04,390
He has good taste
Not like me, dear

1668
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:07,470
I don't need a bike, dear
I'll take you doubles in a cycle

1669
01:42:07,508 --> 01:42:08,469
Who is this?

1670
01:42:08,509 --> 01:42:10,429
This is my Bullet
Chi! I mean, my wife

1671
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:12,027
- Then who is this?
- Then who is she?

1672
01:42:12,067 --> 01:42:14,026
Forgive me
Neither of you pass

1673
01:42:14,068 --> 01:42:15,268
She is original

1674
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:17,387
Then why did you nod your head?

1675
01:42:17,428 --> 01:42:18,586
I didn't shake

1676
01:42:18,628 --> 01:42:20,709
He made me shake my head

1677
01:42:21,628 --> 01:42:23,468
Let's leave now
He'll make you his 3rd wife!

1678
01:42:23,507 --> 01:42:24,947
What is all this?
They are angry

1679
01:42:24,987 --> 01:42:26,187
But I can't hear anything

1680
01:42:26,267 --> 01:42:28,787
- Shut up!
- Maro, what is all this?

1681
01:42:29,706 --> 01:42:31,544
My dad wants to know, tell him

1682
01:42:32,266 --> 01:42:34,184
Why are you ruining
my sister's life?

1683
01:42:34,227 --> 01:42:36,507
That is nothing new for him

1684
01:42:37,502 --> 01:42:39,182
Take a look at this video

1685
01:42:41,262 --> 01:42:42,621
'Sir, 1 minute'

1686
01:42:48,342 --> 01:42:50,257
Only you can see in this phone

1687
01:42:50,299 --> 01:42:52,418
Everyone can watch
on that TV screen

1688
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:32,371
- Can't hear properly
- No audio at all

1689
01:43:44,092 --> 01:43:45,530
My beautiful Sara

1690
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:48,207
I love you too much, 3 much, 4 much, 5 much

1691
01:43:48,286 --> 01:43:51,007
Till my last breath
much...much...very MUCH

1692
01:43:57,406 --> 01:43:59,287
Your sister is a Goddess in human form

1693
01:43:59,365 --> 01:44:02,246
Your dad isn't my father-in-law

1694
01:44:02,286 --> 01:44:03,846
He's another dad to me

1695
01:44:06,641 --> 01:44:09,084
Choosing a bride from
an awesome family like yours

1696
01:44:09,124 --> 01:44:10,603
...we should be blessed indeed

1697
01:44:10,684 --> 01:44:12,124
Real blessing, I swear

1698
01:44:13,522 --> 01:44:15,801
Listen sis-in-law
Thiru may be your husband

1699
01:44:15,841 --> 01:44:17,882
You know who he is to me?
My brother!

1700
01:44:17,922 --> 01:44:20,360
No one can separate
this brother-sister bond

1701
01:44:27,759 --> 01:44:29,799
You, your dad, your sister

1702
01:44:29,839 --> 01:44:32,399
I adore all your family members
very, very, very much

1703
01:44:32,437 --> 01:44:34,438
Wow...wow...wow!

1704
01:44:55,191 --> 01:45:00,231
'When I heard and saw your faces
I was worried your wedding may stop'

1705
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:03,670
'I bribed the hotel staff and got
Psychology Saara's room key'

1706
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:15,788
'Sara'

1707
01:45:15,829 --> 01:45:18,187
'Think you are the cat's whiskers?'

1708
01:45:18,266 --> 01:45:19,628
'My beautiful Sara'

1709
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:22,348
'I love you too much,
3 much, 4 much, 5 much'

1710
01:45:22,387 --> 01:45:24,945
'Till my last breath
much...much...very MUCH'

1711
01:45:34,386 --> 01:45:36,383
This is the wrong video

1712
01:45:36,424 --> 01:45:40,864
In the original video Thiru had maligned
all of you with his choicest cuss words

1713
01:45:40,984 --> 01:45:42,427
I sense something fishy

1714
01:45:42,465 --> 01:45:43,863
Trust me
I'm not lying

1715
01:45:43,903 --> 01:45:45,783
Please, I'm telling the truth

1716
01:45:45,902 --> 01:45:48,982
If you get so worked up
your mental stability will suffer

1717
01:45:49,021 --> 01:45:50,221
Let's discuss this calmly

1718
01:45:50,262 --> 01:45:52,101
Or we can finish
after the engagement?

1719
01:45:52,142 --> 01:45:53,181
You think I'm mad?

1720
01:45:53,221 --> 01:45:54,702
Sara, you're mentally upset

1721
01:45:54,742 --> 01:45:56,458
Do I come across as a lunatic?

1722
01:45:57,418 --> 01:45:59,019
I am not mad

1723
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,580
Believe me please

1724
01:46:01,739 --> 01:46:03,819
I am not a lunatic

1725
01:46:03,898 --> 01:46:05,579
I'm not mad

1726
01:46:05,618 --> 01:46:07,178
- Sara, please
- Let me go

1727
01:46:07,218 --> 01:46:08,816
Sara...Sara!

1728
01:46:21,175 --> 01:46:22,532
ONE

1729
01:46:26,372 --> 01:46:27,732
TWO!

1730
01:46:28,774 --> 01:46:29,772
Sorry

1731
01:46:30,693 --> 01:46:32,614
I'm committing suicide for the 1st time

1732
01:46:32,614 --> 01:46:34,653
That's why I'm a little nervous

1733
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:37,372
How do you feel?

1734
01:46:37,773 --> 01:46:39,054
Is it the 1st time?

1735
01:46:44,332 --> 01:46:45,611
How could you?

1736
01:46:45,893 --> 01:46:47,931
Did I struggle so much
to see you like this?

1737
01:46:49,209 --> 01:46:52,050
The other day when you pointed
your gun, I was scared

1738
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:53,087
But-

1739
01:46:54,126 --> 01:46:55,446
I liked your spunk

1740
01:46:58,529 --> 01:46:59,569
I don't like this

1741
01:47:00,765 --> 01:47:04,566
Should strong girls like you
commit suicide for failing in love?

1742
01:47:05,205 --> 01:47:07,602
Not a crime at all
if you shoot men like me!

1743
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,123
I am to be blamed!

1744
01:47:24,922 --> 01:47:26,799
She trusts me to that extent

1745
01:47:27,078 --> 01:47:28,720
You are a psychology student

1746
01:47:29,482 --> 01:47:31,442
In case this wedding is called off

1747
01:47:32,038 --> 01:47:34,721
How will Sara react-

1748
01:47:35,998 --> 01:47:37,240
Your call then

1749
01:47:50,398 --> 01:47:51,396
If a girl

1750
01:47:52,396 --> 01:47:55,157
...tries to commit suicide
from the top floor

1751
01:47:56,077 --> 01:47:58,115
...how will a boy react?

1752
01:47:59,195 --> 01:48:00,354
I was just testing it

1753
01:48:05,072 --> 01:48:06,152
Give my phone

1754
01:48:07,151 --> 01:48:08,272
Give it to me

1755
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:14,711
Actually the 1st time I set eyes on you
I didn't like you one bit

1756
01:48:14,829 --> 01:48:16,713
Sorry, I'll delete the #

1757
01:48:17,109 --> 01:48:21,030
Hereafter in your life
only 1 Sara will exist!

1758
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:23,948
Okay?

1759
01:48:26,110 --> 01:48:27,510
Happy married life

1760
01:48:28,029 --> 01:48:29,348
Thank you

1761
01:48:46,865 --> 01:48:49,145
I came back to Dubai
without informing Thiru

1762
01:48:57,543 --> 01:49:00,024
Cha! Why isn't he picking my call?

1763
01:49:00,424 --> 01:49:01,701
Pick my call, buddy

1764
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:03,938
I have to share
something very important

1765
01:49:05,259 --> 01:49:07,221
Till you pick my call
I won't stop!

1766
01:49:09,056 --> 01:49:11,339
Hey! What happened to you?

1767
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:16,255
Maro...maro, hold it
We are all standing here

1768
01:49:16,335 --> 01:49:17,537
Mamov!

1769
01:49:17,656 --> 01:49:19,015
What's up, maro?

1770
01:49:19,096 --> 01:49:20,735
I bent backwards for this

1771
01:49:20,775 --> 01:49:22,373
1 minute
Listen to me

1772
01:49:23,214 --> 01:49:27,296
In Goa in Demalo street
is a Chettinad restaurant

1773
01:49:27,335 --> 01:49:29,812
'Adai' and 'Aviyal' combo is soooper

1774
01:49:29,852 --> 01:49:31,333
- Sara
- 1 minute, wait

1775
01:49:31,376 --> 01:49:33,813
Don't forget the 'adai'
like you forgot the 'vada'!

1776
01:49:34,731 --> 01:49:35,932
Guava

1777
01:49:41,051 --> 01:49:42,650
Your friend Dubai Raja?

1778
01:49:45,012 --> 01:49:46,010
Hello?

1779
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:47,288
Sorry, machan

1780
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:48,852
Don't get mad
I didn't tell you

1781
01:49:48,891 --> 01:49:49,969
This is my usual dialog

1782
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:51,811
4 hotels in Dubai
are under my control

1783
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:54,649
If I'm not here for even 1 day
it will stink to high heaven

1784
01:49:54,808 --> 01:49:57,929
I'm cleaning up everything
one by one, you know?

1785
01:49:57,969 --> 01:50:00,566
'Even though you didn't pick my call
for a whole week...'

1786
01:50:00,608 --> 01:50:04,369
...Akash has updated me
spic and span like mopping with phenyl

1787
01:50:04,409 --> 01:50:08,288
'You're the luckiest man
in this world, dude'

1788
01:50:08,486 --> 01:50:11,968
'Or else even after watching the video
with all your choicest cuss words'

1789
01:50:12,006 --> 01:50:13,843
'...would she have married you?'

1790
01:50:16,245 --> 01:50:19,042
'Even if her face is
like an egg fritter'

1791
01:50:19,124 --> 01:50:21,723
'...her head is devoid of brains!'

1792
01:50:23,924 --> 01:50:26,681
'Thiru, whether it is a bathroom or toilet'

1793
01:50:26,722 --> 01:50:29,684
'...only if you clean it once daily
your house will be spotless'

1794
01:50:29,842 --> 01:50:32,842
'Same way if your life
should be without any blemish'

1795
01:50:32,881 --> 01:50:36,523
'...you should watch the video
you sent Sara, once a day without fail'

1796
01:50:36,645 --> 01:50:40,281
'Keep your mind clean promising yourself
not to make any such silly blunders'

1797
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:45,119
'I am sending my copy of the video
to ensure you lead a happy life'

1798
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:48,879
At least understand now

1799
01:50:48,879 --> 01:50:51,439
One who walks with you
till the end is your friend

1800
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,001
'Sara'

1801
01:50:56,041 --> 01:50:58,157
'Think you are the cat's whiskers?'
