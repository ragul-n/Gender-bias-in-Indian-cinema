Huh... You only wanted
to take Tej along with us.

513
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:06,222
Maybe this will scare
him to join us on the trip.

514
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:08,022
You smart fella!

515
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:09,302
Who's that girl by the way?

516
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:10,422
Who knows?

517
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:13,902
Nandini...

518
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:15,662
Nandini!

519
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:17,662
Nandini! Come on!

520
00:29:20,142 --> 00:29:21,502
Sir! Sir! Sir!
Judge wants to see you.

521
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:23,702
Hello, sir.

522
00:29:25,822 --> 00:29:29,782
Sir, this girl ran over me and
my dog Tommy with her bike.

523
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:33,862
Your Honour, my client
has done it accidentally.

524
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,142
She hasn't planned it.

525
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:38,542
So I request you to relieve my client,
Your Honour.

526
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,022
You tell me, dear.

527
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:41,542
I was driving my bike.

528
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:44,662
This dog found a biscuit on the road.
It came running and under my bike.

529
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,262
This old man was chasing after the dog.

530
00:29:46,382 --> 00:29:47,782
I hit them as I lost control.

531
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:51,062
Why, dear? Your bike hasn't got brakes?

532
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:52,622
It does and that is why the old man is alive.

533
00:29:52,702 --> 00:29:54,102
This old man would've been dead otherwise.

534
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:56,102
Rest in peace.
What the hell!

535
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,662
Why do you keep referring to him as old man?

536
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:03,102
'Oh! He's also an old man. I totally forgot.'

537
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,822
This girl named Chalasani Nandini…

538
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,982
…has accepted being guilty of
hitting Mr. Ramaswamy with her bike.

539
00:30:10,262 --> 00:30:14,142
So, for the purpose of
hospital feel for him and his dog…

540
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,862
She should pay 2000 rupees. It is my verdict.

541
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,742
And for making fun of old people.

542
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:23,782
She should spend 15 days at an old age home.

543
00:30:23,942 --> 00:30:28,542
And 15 days at animal
center for hurting the dog.

544
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:32,222
My verdict is that
she should serve those poor animals.

<font color="#FFD700">(VOICE ECHOING)</font>

546
00:30:37,742 --> 00:30:38,942
Come on. Give me money.

547
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:41,422
Hey! Auto man is better than you.

548
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:42,262
Is it?

549
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,822
Get an injection for Snoopy
and come home tomorrow.

550
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:47,462
Hey… I will give you the waiting charges.

551
00:30:47,502 --> 00:30:48,342
Please come inside.

552
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:50,502
Okay. You may go inside.

553
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,222
I will come.

554
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:56,462
Snoopy!
Is it a hospital or a five star hotel?

555
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:58,462
What is this?

556
00:30:58,622 --> 00:30:59,382
Why are you taking so long?

557
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:01,502
You should give bath to 10 dogs.

558
00:31:01,582 --> 00:31:03,182
You have to groom 6 cats.

559
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:04,982
You have to do brushing for 3 horses.

560
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:06,462
Make it fast.

561
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:08,822
O' my God! There are 10 more dogs?

562
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:09,262
Hmm.

563
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,662
I will give you money whatever you ask.

564
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,062
Set me free from this service.

565
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:14,742
No! The lady constable here is very strict.

566
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:17,382
She makes sure that people
who received the punishment are here.

567
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:20,022
She takes updates on your their progress.

568
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,582
But, I can help you.

569
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:23,462
How?

570
00:31:23,502 --> 00:31:25,102
Bring someone in your place.

571
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:26,422
I will manage the rest of it.

572
00:31:26,622 --> 00:31:27,862
Who will agree to do this?

573
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:29,382
Are you that innocent?

574
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:31,742
You look so beautiful.

575
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:34,542
Can't you find a fool?

576
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:38,422
That's fine. But, where will
I find such a fool all of a sudden?

577
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:42,262
'The guy in the train.'

578
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:50,622
Brother! That is Commissioner's daughter.

579
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:53,622
I guess the commissioner must have come.

580
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:55,342
I will leave.

581
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:57,582
Why are you scared?

582
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:58,702
What's your mistake?

583
00:31:58,742 --> 00:31:59,782
I will go and talk to her.

584
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:01,662
Wait.

585
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:04,982
Hi.

586
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:05,982
Hi.

587
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:07,902
Do you remember him?

588
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:11,262
He made you smoke at the station yesterday.

589
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:13,182
Yeah. But, how do you know?

590
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:14,462
I am his sister.

591
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:16,262
He's the same guy.

592
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:18,062
'I couldn't recognize him.'

593
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:21,862
Actually, you might be so angry
that you feel like killing him.

594
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:23,942
Hmm. 'Idiot.'

595
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:26,622
You must be angry just for 2 days.

596
00:32:26,662 --> 00:32:29,302
But, I've been angry for almost 15 years.

597
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:31,542
He has a habit of taking
bribes for everything since childhood.

598
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:32,942
That's me.

599
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,582
I told him that you are
commissioner's daughter.

600
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:36,462
Is it?

601
00:32:36,502 --> 00:32:38,022
You should tell him the same.

602
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:39,542
I request you.

603
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:40,542
Please.

604
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:48,182
'She is pleading her to save me.'

605
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:51,502
'I would've demanded for more commission
if I knew that she loves me so much.'

606
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,342
Please…
Please! Get up…

607
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:54,622
Please get up.

608
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:55,742
Don't leave him.

609
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,902
Okay. Don't worry about it.

610
00:32:58,302 --> 00:32:59,942
I will take care of your brother.

611
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:08,622
'Why are coming to me like a good?'

612
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:10,902
'Didn't my sister's sentiment work?'

613
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:15,142
What happened?

614
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:16,782
Why are you so scared?

615
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:18,582
Yeah. I know that
she is commissioner's daughter.

616
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:20,782
Aren't you scared of commissioner's daughter?

617
00:33:20,822 --> 00:33:22,582
Will she kill me
if she is commissioner's daughter?

618
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:23,542
'I will kill.'

619
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,822
Yes, dad. I will kill him.

620
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:27,502
Dad! He is here.

621
00:33:27,662 --> 00:33:28,542
Come fast.

622
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:30,462
He will leave if you delay.

623
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:31,982
You should encounter him.

624
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:32,982
Please come fast.

625
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:34,742
Excuse me.

626
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:38,222
What is it?

627
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:40,022
Sorry, madam.

628
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:41,382
Are you saying sorry?

629
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:42,782
How dare you?

630
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:44,222
You made me smoke.

631
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:47,062
It is impossible for you to escape.

632
00:33:47,502 --> 00:33:50,342
Is it wrong take revenge for my sister?

633
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:50,902
Huh?

634
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,582
That's me!

635
00:33:53,062 --> 00:33:55,782
Moreover, you took money
from your sister. Didn't you?

636
00:33:57,342 --> 00:33:58,102
Yes!

637
00:33:58,182 --> 00:33:59,182
'I will teach you a lesson.'

638
00:34:00,022 --> 00:34:02,582
Just wait. Let me call my dad.
Madam… Madam.

639
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,022
Let us compromise.

640
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:08,022
I will do whatever you ask me to.

641
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:10,502
Will you do it?
Hmm.

642
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:27,222
Well, you look good.

643
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:29,981
Do you have a girlfriend?

644
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:32,622
Really?

645
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:34,862
O' my goodness!

646
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:36,262
'Idiot.'

647
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:44,101
Then, will you become
my boyfriend 15 days and listen to me?

648
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:49,662
What is this?

649
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:50,862
Does it happen that way?

650
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:52,662
What is like being a boyfriend for 15 days?

651
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:53,302
Huh?

652
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:56,261
Girls might get used to a spa.

653
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,342
If they like it after
feeling the essence of it…

654
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:00,782
Then, they will come again
and again to get a massage.

655
00:35:01,422 --> 00:35:02,902
Otherwise, they will
never visit that spa again.

656
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:04,542
It is simple as that.
Is it?

657
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:05,862
That's true, buddy.

658
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:08,062
Last time, a girl asked me to
come to her hostel in Ameerpet.

659
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:11,222
She asked me apply dye for her.
Hey! Old ladies apply dye. Not girls.

660
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:12,782
See how he talks about it.
Don't be silly, buddy.

661
00:35:14,182 --> 00:35:16,502
You've got a golden chance
to let her feel the essence of it.

662
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:17,622
Don't lose this opportunity.

663
00:35:23,502 --> 00:35:25,302
Buddy! You are so lucky.

664
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:26,822
I got the oil too.

665
00:35:26,862 --> 00:35:28,582
It belongs to my grandpa.

666
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,742
I requested my mom and brought it.
You are so lucky, man.

667
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:48,302
Hi.
Hi.

668
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:49,262
Are they your friends?

00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:50,342
Hi.

670
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:51,662
Think that way.

671
00:35:52,742 --> 00:35:53,662
You forgot, right?

672
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:55,542
It is getting late. Come.

673
00:36:02,022 --> 00:36:02,622
Hey.

674
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:04,942
Did you tell them about us?

675
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:06,982
Okay.

677
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:34,022
Why did we come here?

678
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:35,422
I will tell you. Get down.

679
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,862
Do you know what that
biggest crime in this world is?

680
00:36:39,382 --> 00:36:41,902
Tej! What is the biggest crime in this world?

681
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:44,582
People get rid of their parents
when they become old.

682
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:46,582
I am habituated to serve
such people since childhood.

683
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:48,822
Wow… You are so great.

684
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:49,862
You are not ordinary.

685
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:51,582
You shall be protected!

686
00:36:52,142 --> 00:36:53,502
I just said that to feel good.

687
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:54,862
Nandini!

688
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:56,302
Nandini.

689
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,382
What happened, Rahul?

690
00:36:57,902 --> 00:36:59,062
Is he Rahul?

691
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:02,982
Sit…
I had leg pain all night.

692
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:05,302
Is it?
I am unable to bear it.

693
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:06,102
It is okay.

694
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,862
Applying oil and giving
massage will be smoothening.

695
00:37:07,902 --> 00:37:09,102
Tej! Give me the bottle.

696
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:10,582
Which bottle?

697
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:12,262
The one that your friend gave you.

698
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:13,902
You hid it at the back. That bottle.

699
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:15,542
'How does she know about it?'

700
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:18,422
Hey! Why are giving it to me?

701
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,142
Sit here.

702
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:21,382
Grandpa is hurt.

703
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:22,582
Come on. Give him a massage.

704
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:29,182
Come on.

705
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:30,942
Come on…

706
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:32,702
Come on…come on…

707
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,622
Come on!

708
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:38,542
What, man?

709
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:41,182
Call me when the bottles get over.
I will bring a can.

710
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:41,982
End the call.

711
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,302
Hey, boys and girls.

712
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:45,862
By boyfriend will come to work
instead of me from tomorrow.

713
00:37:45,902 --> 00:37:47,382
Gosh!

714
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:54,382
Hey!

715
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,262
We came here yesterday, right?
Why now?

716
00:37:56,382 --> 00:37:59,582
Tej! Won't you have lunch
if you have the breakfast in the morning?

717
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:02,702
What happened?

718
00:38:04,422 --> 00:38:05,822
Tej! What happened?

719
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:10,422
That means I should go there in the morning
and come here in the evening. Yeah.

720
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:11,142
Yeah.

721
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:15,262
Hey! Did you give bath to all the dogs?

722
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:16,022
Yeah.

723
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:21,222
'I asked you to brush
the horse's teeth. Get up.'

724
00:38:21,222 --> 00:38:23,822
'My leg hurts. Give me a massage, dear.'

725
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,382
No… I will not do it.

726
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:26,702
No! Save me.

727
00:38:26,742 --> 00:38:29,262
Tej! I will never make chicken curry again.

728
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:30,222
Hey!

729
00:38:30,902 --> 00:38:34,462
I am unable to bear that
commissioner daughter's torture.

730
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,182
Hey! She is not commissioner's daughter.

731
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:40,982
This is your uncle and Yashu's drama.

732
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:43,142
Drama?

733
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:46,502
Three!

734
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:47,622
Maria!

735
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:48,382
Stop it.

736
00:38:49,222 --> 00:38:50,102
Who is it?

737
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:54,022
Hey! Why are you letting
down such a good song?

738
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:56,622
No one appreciates good songs these days.

739
00:38:56,662 --> 00:38:57,262
What?

740
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,902
What did you say? Did you sing it well?

741
00:38:59,062 --> 00:38:59,702
You!

742
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:01,822
This is just an act, right?

743
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:03,222
Do you know that I am a famous guitarist?

744
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:04,662
Hmm? Play C minor.

745
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:05,902
I am not a minor. I am a major.

746
00:39:05,982 --> 00:39:06,782
Silly fellow!

747
00:39:07,942 --> 00:39:08,622
Play it.

748
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:15,222
'That means this is going
on depending this guy alone.'

749
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:20,262
What is the name of your troupe?

750
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:23,742
Crazy boys music troupe of India!

751
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,302
Yeah.

752
00:39:24,382 --> 00:39:27,542
We will soon create
an album representing India.

753
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:28,222
What is this?

754
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:30,742
We are practicing for merchant
daughter's event, right?

755
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,222
Uncle said the same thing.

756
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,862
I understood…

757
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:37,902
Tell me this.
Should I keep on searching for you?

758
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:39,942
What are you doing here without
going to the old age home?

759
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:42,462
Why should I go?

760
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:43,942
Why won't you go?

761
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,542
What is it? You talk too much.

762
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:47,982
Your body language has changed.

763
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,422
Did you forget who I am?

764
00:39:49,502 --> 00:39:50,142
Did you forget?

765
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:50,902
Did you forget?

766
00:39:51,662 --> 00:39:52,382
Who are you?

767
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:54,662
Commissioner's daughter.
I'll give you one.

768
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:57,262
Don't say that you are
commissioner's daughter. I will smack you.

769
00:39:57,702 --> 00:39:59,422
Go away. 'He's dead!'

770
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:01,102
Oh!

771
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:02,662
Did you found out everything?

772
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:04,622
Okay, dear.

773
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,622
Recall whatever happened that day.

774
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:09,542
'What happened?'

775
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:13,382
Will you become my boyfriend
15 days and listen to me?

776
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:15,862
Will you come out for a coffee?

777
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:20,062
Not just a coffee shop.
I will go to Kanyakumari as well.

778
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:21,982
Yeah. We went to the coffee shop.

779
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:24,262
Try to recall what happened after that.

780
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:26,502
'What happened after that?'

781
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:31,182
'Where did this girl go?'

782
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:37,102
Where did you go?

783
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:38,942
I will tell you.

784
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:41,342
You are very handsome.

785
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:46,262
You'd ignore me if you find
a girl more beautiful than me.

786
00:40:47,142 --> 00:40:48,102
So, what?

787
00:40:49,502 --> 00:40:53,502
You have to sign this
agreement to keep the trust.

788
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:54,942
Just 15 days.

789
00:40:56,302 --> 00:40:57,422
For the sake of trust?

790
00:40:57,782 --> 00:40:58,822
Silly girl.

791
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:08,862
You've signed this, right?

792
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:10,022
Take it and read it.

793
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:10,862
Read it.

794
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:12,102
No. Not me.

795
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:13,062
Can you read?

796
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:13,902
You read it. Come on.

797
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:18,582
I, Mr. Tej!

798
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:20,502
With my whole senses…

799
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:21,502
With my hands…

800
00:41:21,622 --> 00:41:24,262
I write this note to Miss Nandini.

801
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,262
For playing casino in Goa…

802
00:41:27,782 --> 00:41:29,542
For cricket betting…

803
00:41:29,662 --> 00:41:31,382
For playing cards with friends…

804
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,142
Going out with girls to the pub…

805
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:34,982
Going out with aunts to the club…

806
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:36,822
I bought a sports bike and an iPhone.

807
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:38,062
For all those expenses…

808
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:42,782
I took 25 lakhs from
Miss Nandini for 1 rupee interest.

809
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:47,382
Nandini can use me in
any manner until I fulfill the debts.

810
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,102
She has that right on me.

811
00:41:49,262 --> 00:41:52,862
All the rights belong to Miss Nandini.

812
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:54,182
I am writing in here.

813
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:55,902
Yours loving, Tej!

814
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:02,662
Hey you!

815
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:03,902
Don't you watch movies?

816
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,462
The original document is in the locker.

817
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:07,902
The fake copy can also
be uploaded in Facebook.

818
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:09,622
Superb idea! I will post that right away.

819
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:10,982
Hey! If she files at the court…

820
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:12,902
According to section 423 and 232,
you might go to the prison.

821
00:42:14,822 --> 00:42:16,222
Tell me. What should I do?

822
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:19,942
Listen! I just used free time until now.

823
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:21,982
But, if you talk too much…

824
00:42:22,262 --> 00:42:25,942
You should be available 24 x 7
whenever I call you and come to me.

825
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:27,342
You should do whatever I ask you to.

826
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,502
One more condition!

827
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:33,902
I will kill you if I see you playing music
with a music troupe ever again.

828
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:37,342
Particularly, if I see
that fatso holding a guitar…

829
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:38,342
Then, I'll finish you.

830
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:39,702
Let's go.

831
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:47,542
Proposal pen…

832
00:42:47,662 --> 00:42:49,902
<font color="#FFD700">(VENDING)</font>

833
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:52,422
Just one left! Pen…

834
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:53,462
Hey, boy!

835
00:42:53,662 --> 00:42:54,502
Come here.

836
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:56,142
What do you want, sis?

837
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:57,822
This pen looks different.

838
00:42:57,902 --> 00:42:59,262
This is a proposal pen, sis.

839
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:00,982
It is for guys. It is not for you.

840
00:43:00,982 --> 00:43:02,062
What do you mean that it is for guys?

841
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:06,102
Girls will threaten them
whenever a boy proposes a girl.

842
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:06,902
So…

843
00:43:06,982 --> 00:43:08,982
It will start recording
once you press the button.

844
00:43:09,062 --> 00:43:10,782
You can listen to it when you press it again.

845
00:43:11,582 --> 00:43:12,422
I love you.

846
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:14,182
I love you.

847
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:17,422
I love you. I love you.

848
00:43:17,782 --> 00:43:19,422
I love you… I love you…

849
00:43:19,502 --> 00:43:21,782
Hey… Stop it.
How long will you show the demo?

850
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:23,742
It's awesome.

851
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:24,582
Give me one.

852
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,342
I might like someone and
feel like proposing them.

853
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:28,942
It will be useful then.
Why do you need one, sis?

854
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,222
You already have a boyfriend.

855
00:43:30,382 --> 00:43:31,942
Hey! No one will give it to him.

856
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,782
I will give it to someone whom I like.

857
00:43:34,182 --> 00:43:34,902
Hey!

858
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:36,222
Okay.

952
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:16,822
Excuse me, sir.

953
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:18,782
Did you come again?

954
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:21,262
How many times should
I tell you again and again?

955
00:48:21,382 --> 00:48:22,742
You are problematic.

956
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,182
Sir! Please, sir.

957
00:48:24,262 --> 00:48:25,702
This is very important to me.

958
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:28,982
You have to help me.
Murthy went to UK for the cricket league.

959
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:31,302
He'd be busy with players there.

960
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,702
You cannot get him.
Didn't I give you his number last time?

961
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:35,142
He is not picking my calls, sir.

962
00:48:35,302 --> 00:48:36,662
I have the same number.

963
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:38,502
Please, sir. Try to do something.

964
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:39,222
Do one thing.

965
00:48:39,302 --> 00:48:42,022
He'll come for the Vizag cricket
league on the 20th of this month.

966
00:48:42,142 --> 00:48:43,262
You can go there and meet him.

967
00:48:43,342 --> 00:48:44,502
Thank you so much, sir.

968
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:55,462
Don't worry, dear.

969
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:56,622
We are finding him, right?

970
00:48:56,982 --> 00:48:59,342
Mr. Murthy will solve your problem.

971
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:00,982
Today is 1st.

972
00:49:01,382 --> 00:49:04,422
It is just 20 days. Let's wait.

973
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:08,862
Meanwhile, I will send my people
and try to find something.

974
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:10,142
Thank you so much, sir.

975
00:49:10,262 --> 00:49:11,902

976
00:49:12,302 --> 00:49:13,382

977
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:14,382
What for?

978
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:16,062
I know you as a child.

979
00:49:16,342 --> 00:49:17,062

980
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:18,822
Dear.
Yes, sir.

981
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:20,582
Did we get the call?
No. Not now.

982
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,422
Hey! Someone of you go by the other gate.

983
00:49:25,942 --> 00:49:28,142
We shouldn't miss Nandini this time.

984
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:29,622
We should be ready to do anything for it.

985
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:33,862
Hello.

986
00:49:34,142 --> 00:49:34,822

987
00:49:35,262 --> 00:49:36,222
What weren't picking up my call?

988
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:37,342
How many times should I call you?

989
00:49:37,902 --> 00:49:39,422
Where are you?
What don't you say something?

990
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:40,022
Tell me.

991
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:41,542
Yeah! I am here. I am coming.

992
00:49:41,582 --> 00:49:42,982
I asked you to come here, right?

993
00:49:43,062 --> 00:49:43,702
When did I say?

994
00:49:43,742 --> 00:49:46,182
I will go to the court
if you don't come here in 5 minutes.

995
00:49:46,222 --> 00:49:47,022
Are you coming or not?

996
00:49:49,102 --> 00:49:51,022
'I should show him my power.'

997
00:49:51,182 --> 00:49:52,062
'Idiot!'

998
00:49:52,142 --> 00:49:53,142
Nandini madam.

999
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:56,862
'He will not stay away from me.'

1000
00:49:57,342 --> 00:49:58,462
Wait, madam.

1001
00:49:58,982 --> 00:50:00,502
Madam. Hey, Nandini.

1002
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,782
Hey! Follow her.

1003
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:09,942
Go… Go!
Hop on.

1004
00:50:09,982 --> 00:50:10,902
Go fast.

1005
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:12,302
Make it fast.
Yeah! I am going. Okay.

1006
00:50:15,822 --> 00:50:17,222
Hey! Drive fast. Please.

1007
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:18,302
Why should I drive fast?

1008
00:50:18,342 --> 00:50:19,862
I will tell you later. Just go.

1009
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:20,822
Okay.

1010
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:22,622
Hey! Drive fast.

1011
00:50:36,822 --> 00:50:38,262
Why did you bring me here?

1012
00:50:38,382 --> 00:50:39,862
I will tell you. Get down.

1013
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:42,982
Who were they?

1014
00:50:43,102 --> 00:50:44,102
Why are they following us?

1015
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:45,262
Who?

1016
00:50:45,382 --> 00:50:46,182
I don't know.

1017
00:50:46,382 --> 00:50:47,142
Is it?

1018
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:50,822
Let's relax here for 5 minutes.

1019
00:50:50,862 --> 00:50:51,422
Hey.

1020
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:55,542
Hey! They came here.

1021
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:57,782
Please go. Please… Please.
They came here.

1022
00:50:57,822 --> 00:50:59,342
Please. Please let us go from here.
Hey!

1023
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:02,822
Nandini will not come to us
if we ask her nicely.

1024
00:51:02,982 --> 00:51:04,382
We should tense her up.

1025
00:51:04,422 --> 00:51:05,302
Who are they?
Please.

1026
00:51:05,942 --> 00:51:08,782
They are from my village.

1027
00:51:08,822 --> 00:51:10,782
They are forcing me for the wedding.

1028
00:51:10,822 --> 00:51:12,942
That is why… That is why they are after me.

1029
00:51:13,142 --> 00:51:13,862
Hmm?

1030
00:51:13,902 --> 00:51:14,542
Hmm.

1031
00:51:14,942 --> 00:51:16,102
Hey! Take her away.

1032
00:51:16,342 --> 00:51:18,022
Please… Please. Let's go away from here.

1033
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:20,022
Please…Please. Please save me.

1034
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:22,542
I will do whatever you ask me to.
Will you do whatever I ask you to?

1035
00:51:22,782 --> 00:51:23,622
Yes. I will do it.

1036
00:51:23,702 --> 00:51:25,822
Will you sign my documents?

1037
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,462
'He's smart.'

1038
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:30,422
But, there are no documents, right?

1039
00:51:31,302 --> 00:51:32,382
They're ready.

1040
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:35,662
'He came with them.'

1041
00:51:35,702 --> 00:51:38,222
I've been waiting for this
situation from many days.

1042
00:51:43,262 --> 00:51:44,102
Hmm.

1043
00:51:49,582 --> 00:51:51,062
But, this is blank.

1044
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:52,182
Won't you sign then?

1045
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,102
Let's relax then.

1046
00:51:54,822 --> 00:51:55,782
I am signing it.

1047
00:51:55,902 --> 00:51:56,422
Do it.

1048
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,982
Hey! Go, grab her and come.

1049
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:02,542
I did it, boss.

1050
00:54:03,422 --> 00:54:04,742
Did you sign all the papers?

1051
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:05,462
Hmm.

1052
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,902
Start being my girlfriend, baby.

1053
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:10,302
Give it…

1054
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:12,422
'Pass the ball. What are you doing?'

1055
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:13,422
'What energy!'

1056
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:14,862
'Buddy! What are you doing?'

1057
00:54:15,022 --> 00:54:16,622
Goal! Come on.

1058
00:54:16,702 --> 00:54:17,462
What have you done?

1059
00:54:17,582 --> 00:54:19,942
Hey! Pass me the ball.
What's the use in passing you the ball?

1060
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:21,102
The girl is here.

1061
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:22,302
Go and start working.

1062
00:54:25,782 --> 00:54:26,662
Good morning, boss.

1063
00:54:26,702 --> 00:54:28,062
Hey! Why are you late?

1064
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:29,142
Should I wait for you every day?

1065
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:30,542
There's a traffic jam, boss.
Is it?

1066
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:31,582
Get me the ball.

1067
00:54:32,342 --> 00:54:33,342
Where is the ball?

1068
00:54:34,622 --> 00:54:35,502
Go and find it.

1069
00:54:35,942 --> 00:54:37,142
Brother! Where is the ball?

1070
00:54:39,862 --> 00:54:41,142
Brother! Where is the ball?

1071
00:54:43,142 --> 00:54:44,302
Hey! Tell me where the ball is.

1072
00:54:44,622 --> 00:54:47,022
Hey.
Brother! Where is the ball?

1073
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:49,182
Is it there? Thanks, brother.

1074
00:54:50,782 --> 00:54:51,622
Ball, boss.

1075
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:55,062
I asked you to come at 7 am, right?

1076
00:54:56,062 --> 00:54:57,222
Go and get Tea for everyone.

1077
00:54:57,302 --> 00:54:58,182
Go…

1078
00:54:58,262 --> 00:54:59,022
Okay, boss.

1079
00:55:00,302 --> 00:55:01,382
Money!

1080
00:55:01,942 --> 00:55:03,142
What? Do you need money?

1081
00:55:03,382 --> 00:55:04,262
You!

1082
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:12,342
Hello.

1083
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:13,662
Buddy.
Tell me.

1084
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:14,982
Buddy.

1085
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:16,022
Tell me.

1086
00:55:16,422 --> 00:55:18,382
My girlfriend broke up with me
and is going to Singapore.

1087
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:20,942
Her company promised to
give 5 lakhs hike on salary.

1088
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:22,142
That is why she is going away from me.

1089
00:55:22,302 --> 00:55:23,062
Good thing happened.

1090
00:55:23,502 --> 00:55:26,102
I told you to marry her to be happy.

1091
00:55:26,182 --> 00:55:26,862
You didn't listen to me.

1092
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:27,782
What did you say?

1093
00:55:27,942 --> 00:55:30,022
Living together… Face it now.

1094
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:31,782
She tied Rakhi to you that day.

1095
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:32,862
She will listen to you.

1096
00:55:32,982 --> 00:55:33,982
I don't know what you will do.

1097
00:55:34,062 --> 00:55:35,342
You have to stop her from
going to Singapore. That's it.

1098
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:36,622
Hey! How can I come in the last moment?

1099
00:55:36,662 --> 00:55:38,102
I have an exam at 2 pm.

1100
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:40,262
How will you pass that paper?

1101
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,662
Hey! I didn't pass for the first attempt.
That is why I am writing again.

1102
00:55:43,742 --> 00:55:44,342
Buddy!

1103
00:55:44,422 --> 00:55:47,102
I will give up my life
if you do not stop her.

1104
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,502
Hey! Stop crying.

1105
00:55:48,582 --> 00:55:49,342
Let's do something.

1106
00:55:49,462 --> 00:55:51,742
Both of you meet me at
the continental hospital in one hour.

1107
00:55:52,902 --> 00:55:53,662
Okay, buddy.

1108
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:56,902
Did you give it to everyone?

1109
00:55:57,142 --> 00:55:58,222
Hmm.
Sit.

1110
00:55:58,742 --> 00:55:59,582
Where, boss?

1111
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:02,182
Should I read out the document?

1112
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:04,422
Sit.

1113
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:09,982
Accept it. Please.

1114
00:56:10,102 --> 00:56:12,262
It is just for 30 minutes.
Hey! Is it a hospital or a drama company?

1115
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:14,742
Listen! There is a small issue.
I have to solve it. Please.

1116
00:56:16,142 --> 00:56:17,502
Who is the patient, by the way?
She is the one.

1117
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:18,782
Me?

1118
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:20,142
Oh!

1119
00:56:20,662 --> 00:56:23,022
Doctor! Give them the ICU for one hour.

1120
00:56:23,062 --> 00:56:23,662
Okay, sir.

1121
00:56:23,702 --> 00:56:25,182
Hey! What's going on here?
Sssh!

1122
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:30,662
Listen! You shouldn't talk for 5 minutes.

1123
00:56:34,862 --> 00:56:35,822
Hey! Are they coming?

1124
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:38,902
I am so happy to see her like this.

1125
00:56:38,942 --> 00:56:39,462
Hey.

1126
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:45,142
Are you giving her a shock treatment?

1127
00:56:48,982 --> 00:56:50,262
Haven't you tied her hands?

1128
00:56:51,462 --> 00:56:53,462
Sorry.
Why do you do it all the time?

1129
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,022
Why didn't he tie her hands?

1130
00:57:00,382 --> 00:57:01,502
What must have happened, Madhu?

1131
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:03,022
I don't know anything. Let's see.

1132
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:07,382
Brother! What happened?

1133
00:57:08,302 --> 00:57:10,262
My wife tried to commit suicide.

1134
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:12,382
Wife?

1135
00:57:12,502 --> 00:57:13,782
When did you marry?

1136
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:16,622
Listen! They're living together just like us.

1137
00:57:16,662 --> 00:57:17,542
Don't stop the flow.

1138
00:57:17,622 --> 00:57:19,422
You say, buddy.
She works for Google.

1139
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:22,782
She was offered 1 lakh salary
hike to go Australia.

1140
00:57:23,422 --> 00:57:25,062
I forced her to go.

1141
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:27,062
Do you know what Nandu said?

1142
00:57:27,302 --> 00:57:29,102
How can I leave you for 1 lakh?

1143
00:57:29,262 --> 00:57:30,542
I am not that cheap.

1144
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:32,502
I belong to a decent family.

1145
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:34,862
1 lakh is not needed.

1146
00:57:34,942 --> 00:57:36,062
5000 rupees is enough.

1147
00:57:36,182 --> 00:57:38,062
I will kill him and go to Australia.

1148
00:57:38,182 --> 00:57:39,302
I didn't listen to her.

1149
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:42,302
I did her signature and
mailed the letter to her company.

1150
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:44,942
She attempted suicide
when she got to know that.

1151
00:57:45,502 --> 00:57:46,742
He is lying a lot.

1152
00:57:46,902 --> 00:57:50,862
Listen! Don't send my sister
if she gets an offer like that.

1153
00:57:50,942 --> 00:57:53,902
She might get ready to die
if she had to leave you.

1154
00:57:53,982 --> 00:57:56,422
I cannot withstand that.
No, brother.

1155
00:57:56,742 --> 00:57:58,942
I am also from a decent family.

1156
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:01,862
It is not my character
to be greedy for money.

1157
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:03,582
I will not go to Singapore.
Sheila.

1158
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,382
I will not go even if you ask me to.

1159
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:08,182
You've made me realize, brother.

1160
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:10,382
I will meet sister-in-law.

1161
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:11,822
I will tell her.

1162
00:58:11,942 --> 00:58:12,742
I will tell her.

1163
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:13,662
She is sleeping.

1164
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,902
You got emotional.

1165
00:58:15,022 --> 00:58:16,542
Take her. Take my sister and go.

1166
00:58:16,982 --> 00:58:17,582
You come.

1167
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:18,862
Go…

1168
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:23,342
Hey! Have you cancelled
the plan to go to Singapore?

1169
00:58:23,382 --> 00:58:24,542
What are you saying, buddy?
How does he know?

1170
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,502
No… His girlfriend ran away with someone.

1171
00:58:26,542 --> 00:58:28,222
Let's go.
What did you do?

1172
00:58:33,982 --> 00:58:35,022
How dare you!
Hey!

1173
00:58:35,662 --> 00:58:39,662
Don't take an advantage of it
and make plans to marry me.

1174
00:58:39,702 --> 00:58:40,742
I will kill you.

1175
00:58:41,582 --> 00:58:42,782
Do you get it?

1176
00:58:45,782 --> 00:58:46,902
What do you think of yourself?

1177
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:50,302
I have used you to my work.
So, will you let me do all this?

1178
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,342
I am silent because I signed the agreement.

1179
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:54,382
Otherwise…

1180
00:58:54,942 --> 00:58:56,422
What will you do otherwise?
Otherwise…

1181
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:57,582
What will you do otherwise?

1182
00:59:08,702 --> 00:59:09,982
Did you see my friend who came now?

1183
00:59:10,182 --> 00:59:12,462
He loved that girl very badly.

1184
00:59:12,742 --> 00:59:14,622
He will die if she leaves him.

1185
00:59:15,662 --> 00:59:18,102
I did this drama to save their love.

1186
00:59:18,662 --> 00:59:19,982
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1187
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:24,422
I would've written whatever
I want if I really plan to use you.

1188
00:59:24,942 --> 00:59:26,262
But, my heart didn't let me do that.

1189
00:59:26,342 --> 00:59:27,102
Do you know why?

1190
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,382
I love you a lot.

1191
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:32,462
I felt it when I saw you for the first time.

1192
00:59:33,062 --> 00:59:34,742
You asked me to act like your boyfriend.

1193
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:36,742
I became your boyfriend in real.

1194
00:59:37,142 --> 00:59:38,742
I did whatever you asked with love.

1195
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:40,862
I did it for my love.

1196
00:59:41,222 --> 00:59:42,262
I love you, Nandu.

1197
00:59:43,422 --> 00:59:46,462
Come to me tell tomorrow if you like me.

1198
00:59:47,422 --> 00:59:51,342
Otherwise, I will consider that you…

1199
00:59:51,702 --> 00:59:52,302
Bye.

1227
01:03:10,862 --> 01:03:12,182
We tried a lot, sir.

1228
01:03:12,782 --> 01:03:15,062
Madam escaped from us.

1229
01:03:16,822 --> 01:03:18,582
Did you take 10 lakhs to say this?

1230
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,142
Drive. Stop the car.

1231
01:03:21,582 --> 01:03:23,342
Sir! Give me one more chance.

1232
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,622
'I will get her this time.'
'Get out.'

1233
01:03:33,622 --> 01:03:36,662
'Why did you deceive me? Why?'

1234
01:03:44,382 --> 01:03:46,062
Lakshmi! Why did you come out?

1235
01:03:46,262 --> 01:03:47,502
You have breathing problem, right?

1236
01:03:47,822 --> 01:03:49,742
Why did you deceive me?

1237
01:03:52,582 --> 01:03:53,342
Please, sir.

1238
01:03:54,062 --> 01:03:55,782
Lakshmi! Everyone is watching us.

1239
01:03:55,822 --> 01:03:56,982
Can we talk later?

1240
01:03:58,062 --> 01:03:59,462
What is there to talk now?

1241
01:04:00,262 --> 01:04:03,382
A kid saved my life 15 years ago.

1242
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:06,622
I asked you to help him.
But, what have you done?

1243
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,462
Lakshmi! Try to understand.

1244
01:04:08,902 --> 01:04:12,262
I asked you many times and
you said that you helped him.

1245
01:04:12,822 --> 01:04:14,982
I trusted you.

1246
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:17,542
But, you didn't do anything.

1247
01:04:18,342 --> 01:04:20,982
That kid was imprisoned for 7 years.

1248
01:04:21,102 --> 01:04:22,262
Lakshmi! Leave it.

1249
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:24,182
He just did a small favor.

1250
01:04:24,422 --> 01:04:25,742
Should you spend a lot of him for that?

1251
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:27,382
I haven't done anything for my sake.

1252
01:04:27,462 --> 01:04:28,942
Everything is under our daughter's name.

1253
01:04:29,022 --> 01:04:31,462
How can you be so selfish?

1254
01:04:32,342 --> 01:04:36,222
To save my life, he…

1255
01:04:36,422 --> 01:04:37,742
Hey! Lakshmi!

1256
01:04:39,302 --> 01:04:40,222
Lakshmi!

1257
01:04:41,662 --> 01:04:42,542
Lakshmi!

1258
01:04:49,742 --> 01:04:50,422
Yeah, dad.

1259
01:04:54,862 --> 01:04:56,222
We did all kind of tests.

1260
01:04:56,622 --> 01:04:58,062
I don't know what the problem is.

1261
01:04:58,862 --> 01:04:59,462
Mom.

1262
01:05:00,422 --> 01:05:01,022
Mom.

1263
01:05:05,182 --> 01:05:06,102
Nandini.

1264
01:05:08,662 --> 01:05:11,382
Your father deceived me.

1265
01:05:11,422 --> 01:05:13,422
<font color="#FFD700">(<< PAST REWIND <<)</font>

1266
01:05:17,022 --> 01:05:18,382
Go to India.

1267
01:05:18,862 --> 01:05:20,862
Try somehow to meet him.

1268
01:05:21,582 --> 01:05:26,622
My mom didn't forget you.
She thought about until her last breathe.

1269
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:27,942
Say this to him.

1270
01:05:29,902 --> 01:05:33,062
Tell him that I asked him for an apology.

1271
01:05:35,982 --> 01:05:38,542
Will you fulfill my wish?

1272
01:05:44,662 --> 01:05:45,822
I am going to India.

1273
01:05:46,702 --> 01:05:49,462
I will find him and
fulfill my mom's last wish.

1274
01:05:50,022 --> 01:05:52,902
You've bought property on my name, right?

1275
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:53,862
I will give that to him.

1276
01:05:54,142 --> 01:05:54,902
What do you mean?

1277
01:05:55,062 --> 01:05:56,182
How can you give it to him?

1278
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:57,902
You must've bought it for me.

1279
01:05:57,942 --> 01:05:59,422
But, it belongs to him according to me.

1280
01:05:59,502 --> 01:06:01,182
Your mom is crazy. Have you gone crazy?

1281
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,022
I gave that site to someone else.

1282
01:06:03,102 --> 01:06:04,142
I took the advance.

1283
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:10,062
Mom told me before dying that
she couldn't help him because of you.

1284
01:06:10,662 --> 01:06:12,222
She remembered him all the time.

1285
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,662
She should be relieved from that grief.

1286
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,142
For her soul to rest in peace…

1287
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,502
I should go and meet him.

1288
01:06:20,462 --> 01:06:21,382
Not just that.

1289
01:06:22,222 --> 01:06:24,862
I enjoyed mom's love because of him.

1290
01:06:25,462 --> 01:06:26,982
So, he has that right.

1291
01:06:27,742 --> 01:06:29,702
You will not go to India.

1292
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:30,822
Get it?

1293
01:06:31,622 --> 01:06:32,822
'I want to go to India.'

1294
01:06:33,502 --> 01:06:34,782
'I will go for sure.'

1295
01:06:41,982 --> 01:06:42,622
Hello.

1296
01:06:42,702 --> 01:06:44,102
Sir! I am calling to discuss
about that land in Vizag.

1297
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,982
Yes. That is why I came to India.

1298
01:06:46,222 --> 01:06:48,102
You already took 10 crores in advance.

1299
01:06:48,262 --> 01:06:49,102
There is no response.

1300
01:06:49,262 --> 01:06:50,702
No… That site belongs to you.

1301
01:06:50,742 --> 01:06:51,582
You can confirm.

1302
01:06:51,622 --> 01:06:52,382
Okay. Sure, sir.

1303
01:07:06,182 --> 01:07:07,222
Hello, bike.

1304
01:07:07,462 --> 01:07:09,102
What is your boss writing inside?

1305
01:07:18,022 --> 01:07:18,982
Excuse me, sir.

1306
01:07:19,742 --> 01:07:20,462
Please.

1307
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:26,062
Hello! Yes.

1308
01:07:26,102 --> 01:07:28,582
Sir! There is a guy named Tej inside.

1309
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:30,502
Can you call him out?
Should I call him?

1310
01:07:30,782 --> 01:07:32,502
This is an exam that's going on here.

1311
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:45,942
'Tej! I fell in love with you.'

1312
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,822
'How can I hold it in my heart this long?'

1313
01:07:48,622 --> 01:07:50,462
'I cannot hide it like how you did.'

1314
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:52,382
'So, I came to express it now.'

1315
01:07:53,182 --> 01:07:55,702
'Write your exam later. Come out first.'

1316
01:07:56,462 --> 01:07:59,022
'I love you… I love you!'

1317
01:07:59,902 --> 01:08:01,702
'I will fail even this time.'

1318
01:08:01,902 --> 01:08:03,902
'I don't understand why the questions
that I prepare don't appear here.'

1319
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:12,102
Sir.

1320
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:14,782
What happened now?

1321
01:08:14,822 --> 01:08:15,942
Sir. This is a letter.

1322
01:08:17,142 --> 01:08:18,142
How dare you!

1323
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,381
I thought that only guys cheat in the exam.

1324
01:08:20,582 --> 01:08:21,662
Even girls are into cheating now.

1325
01:08:21,742 --> 01:08:23,382
That too, you're giving it to a professor.

1326
01:08:26,022 --> 01:08:27,462
'You fool!'

1327
01:08:35,742 --> 01:08:36,382
Tej!

1328
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,462
Tej!

1329
01:08:56,502 --> 01:08:57,222

Tej!

1333
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:28,261
Tej.

1334
01:09:44,502 --> 01:09:45,982
Hey! What happened to Nandini?

1335
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:48,302
What happened to Nandini?

1336
01:09:48,782 --> 01:09:50,622
Hey! Tell me what happened to Nandini.

1337
01:09:50,702 --> 01:09:52,782
Karthik! You tell me
what happened to Nandini.

1338
01:09:52,942 --> 01:09:54,342
Hey! Why doesn't anyone say something?

1339
01:10:02,742 --> 01:10:03,102
Hey.

1340
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:16,142
They frightened me.

1341
01:10:16,302 --> 01:10:17,382
I was worried.

1342
01:10:18,222 --> 01:10:19,462
Do you love her?

1343
01:10:19,502 --> 01:10:20,222
Yeah. Why?

1344
01:10:22,422 --> 01:10:24,222
I don't know why you guys are bothering me.

1345
01:10:24,302 --> 01:10:26,222
I can't recall why I came to India.

1346
01:10:26,342 --> 01:10:28,862
Please don't ask me the same question
again and again.

1347
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,262
Now, just leave me alone.

1348
01:10:30,342 --> 01:10:31,422
I need to see my mom.

1349
01:10:32,342 --> 01:10:34,382
Doctor! Please. I need to talk to my dad.

1350
01:10:35,462 --> 01:10:36,742
Doctor! At least you tell them.

1351
01:10:37,262 --> 01:10:37,822
Doctor?

1352
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:40,982
Of course, he is a doctor.

1353
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:44,782
Sir! Can you please give me your phone?

1354
01:10:44,822 --> 01:10:45,942
I need to speak to my dad.

1355
01:10:54,942 --> 01:10:56,062
What happened to her?

1356
01:10:56,142 --> 01:10:58,302
She forgot that she came to India.

1357
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:05,982
'We tried a lot.'

1358
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,222
'She talks about her dad who is in London.'

1359
01:11:08,262 --> 01:11:10,182
'But, she doesn't say anything about you.'

1360
01:11:10,302 --> 01:11:11,942
'She completely forgot you.'

1361
01:11:28,822 --> 01:11:29,742
Nandini.

1362
01:11:30,262 --> 01:11:30,862
Dad.

1363
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:36,102
Dad! Where is mom?

1364
01:11:36,662 --> 01:11:37,862
Come with me. I'll tell you.

1365
01:11:49,662 --> 01:11:50,262
Nandini.

1366
01:12:19,462 --> 01:12:21,502
It is lacunar amnesia.

1367
01:12:21,582 --> 01:12:23,262
She had a head injury.

1368
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:26,822
So, her memory storage tissues are damaged.

1369
01:12:26,862 --> 01:12:30,382
That is why her memory is lost permanently.

1370
01:12:30,702 --> 01:12:32,542
She can remember everything.

1371
01:12:32,702 --> 01:12:35,582
But, she cannot recall something that
happened for a particular period.

1372
01:12:36,062 --> 01:12:38,582
It varies in patients.

1373
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:40,422
Some people lose 5 years of memory.

1374
01:12:40,462 --> 01:12:42,462
Some people lose 2 years of memory.

1375
01:12:42,502 --> 01:12:44,622
Let's talk about your daughter Nandini.

1376
01:12:44,702 --> 01:12:46,662
She lost 3 months and 12 days of her memory.

1377
01:12:47,182 --> 01:12:49,902
That includes the death of
her mother and her comeback to India.

1378
01:12:49,942 --> 01:12:52,182
Everything that happened before
the accident is erased from her memory.

1379
01:12:52,382 --> 01:12:54,182
Her brain is 100 percent perfect.

1380
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:55,862
Her health condition is also good.

1381
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:10,222
Sir! Your daughter forgot
whatever is needed to be forgotten.

1382
01:13:10,582 --> 01:13:11,302
Shut up.

1383
01:13:11,342 --> 01:13:13,902
Find out where she kept the documents.

1384
01:13:13,942 --> 01:13:15,182
We have to sell the site, right?

1385
01:13:15,302 --> 01:13:17,142
She might get suspicious if we ask her now.

1386
01:13:17,302 --> 01:13:18,742
Let's take her to London first.

1387
01:13:19,022 --> 01:13:20,102
Let's go.
But, sir! Listen to me.

1388
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:21,262
Let's talk about it later.

1389
01:13:24,462 --> 01:13:26,062
Nandini! Let us go.

1390
01:13:26,342 --> 01:13:26,822
Dad.

1391
01:13:27,022 --> 01:13:27,702
What happened, dear?

1392
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:29,702
I came here to fulfill my mom's wish, right?

1393
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,662
Of course! Is there any doubt?

1394
01:13:31,862 --> 01:13:35,102
Should I call the person
that you met in India?

1395
01:13:35,942 --> 01:13:37,062
Let it be, dad.

1396
01:13:37,582 --> 01:13:39,222
You said it. So, it must be true.

1397
01:13:40,102 --> 01:13:41,822
I don't want to meet anyone.

1398
01:13:42,942 --> 01:13:44,702
Let's go to London directly.

1399
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,782
<font color="#FFD700">(PHONE RINGING)</font>

1400
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:05,382
Hello.

1401
01:14:05,462 --> 01:14:05,902
Tej!

1402
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:08,022
Sister wants to talk to you.

1403
01:14:11,662 --> 01:14:12,222
Tej!

1404
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:13,422
Aunt!

1405
01:14:14,222 --> 01:14:15,342
What happened to you?

1406
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:17,942
Nothing happened to me, aunt.

1407
01:14:18,342 --> 01:14:20,022
Don't I know about my son?

1408
01:14:21,342 --> 01:14:22,502
You are very sad.

1409
01:14:26,502 --> 01:14:28,542
No, aunt. I am fine.

1410
01:14:29,222 --> 01:14:30,382
I feel like seeing you.

1411
01:14:31,302 --> 01:14:32,462
Come here once, dear.

1412
01:14:32,982 --> 01:14:34,062
Not now, aunt.

1413
01:14:34,582 --> 01:14:36,582
It might be an issue if uncle finds out.

1414
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:38,302
I will come some other time.

1415
01:14:38,662 --> 01:14:39,742
'Come just for once.'

1416
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,022
Hmm. Bye.

1417
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:43,742
Calm down, sister.

1418
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,182
He will come.

1419
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:47,582
What happened?

1420
01:14:47,702 --> 01:14:49,142
Why didn't you all go to the ground?

1421
01:14:49,702 --> 01:14:51,662
How can we go to the ground
when you're like this?

1422
01:14:52,182 --> 01:14:52,622
Hmm?

1423
01:14:53,742 --> 01:14:55,822
How can we go to the ground
when you're like this?

1424
01:14:55,982 --> 01:14:57,382
Hey! Just chill, buddy.

1425
01:14:57,622 --> 01:14:58,902
How can I just chill?

1426
01:14:59,422 --> 01:15:01,462
We know that you did a lot for her.

1427
01:15:01,662 --> 01:15:02,542
Let's do something.

1428
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:04,742
Let's go to Nandini and tell her everything
that has happened.

1429
01:15:05,862 --> 01:15:07,622
You've seen her at the hospital.
Didn't you?

1430
01:15:08,222 --> 01:15:09,702
She couldn't recognize me.

1431
01:15:10,062 --> 01:15:12,462
Then, how will she recognize my love?

1432
01:15:14,382 --> 01:15:19,982
Moreover, doctor said
she cannot recall everything again.

1433
01:15:20,502 --> 01:15:21,582
What shall we do now?

1434
01:15:21,942 --> 01:15:23,062
Will you be able to forget her?

1435
01:15:23,702 --> 01:15:24,542
It is tough, buddy.

1436
01:15:25,462 --> 01:15:28,822
God has given her a memory loss.

1437
01:15:29,622 --> 01:15:32,182
It would be good if there's a way to erase
feelings from heart as well.

1438
01:15:48,062 --> 01:15:49,222
Yeah…I am coming.

1439
01:15:49,622 --> 01:15:51,662
Sorry…Sorry.
Are you blind? Can't you see?

1440
01:15:51,902 --> 01:15:52,822
Sorry, sir.

1441
01:15:53,702 --> 01:15:54,982
You are…?

1442
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:16,662
Why did you try to abduct Nandini that day?

1443
01:16:16,742 --> 01:16:21,102
Her father sent me to bring Nandini.
Hey! Why will her father do such thing?

1444
01:16:21,142 --> 01:16:21,942
I don't know.

1445
01:16:22,062 --> 01:16:24,462
He asked me to injure her and take her to him.
Why so?

1446
01:16:24,502 --> 01:16:25,702
I don't know all that.

1447
01:16:26,102 --> 01:16:28,662
But, he was tensed because he might lose
the property if she's not found.

1448
01:16:28,702 --> 01:16:29,542
What property?

1449
01:16:29,702 --> 01:16:30,542
Whose property?

1450
01:16:30,582 --> 01:16:32,022
I don't know anything other than this, sir.

1451
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:33,222
We are not goons.

1452
01:16:33,342 --> 01:16:35,342
We work for his friend's company in India.

1453
01:16:35,422 --> 01:16:36,822
I can you show you my Aadhar card
if you want.

1454
01:16:37,022 --> 01:16:39,142
Sir! I've got kids.
Hey! Get lost.

1455
01:16:39,222 --> 01:16:40,222
Thank you, sir.
Get lost.

1456
01:16:41,982 --> 01:16:44,302
'That means Nandini's issue is her dad.'

1457
01:16:44,982 --> 01:16:46,782
'That is why she came back to India.'

1458
01:16:50,182 --> 01:16:50,662
Hello.

1459
01:16:50,782 --> 01:16:53,822
Buddy! Nandini's father is taking her
to London.

1460
01:16:54,262 --> 01:16:55,262
What shall we do now?

1461
01:16:56,222 --> 01:16:56,702
'Hello?'

1462
01:16:57,502 --> 01:16:57,942
'Hello?'

1463
01:17:02,062 --> 01:17:03,582
Come on, dear. Make it fast.

1464
01:17:03,622 --> 01:17:04,742
We're getting late to catch our flight.

1465
01:17:04,782 --> 01:17:06,102
I have no idea when will
I come to India again.

1466
01:17:06,182 --> 01:17:07,742
Just give me 5 minutes.
Hmm. Okay.

1467
01:17:07,782 --> 01:17:08,262
Okay.

1468
01:17:08,982 --> 01:17:09,542
This is okay.

1469
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:15,262
Hey! Come fast.

1470
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:16,502
That girl is coming.

1471
01:17:16,862 --> 01:17:17,942
Listen, dear. We don't have much time.

1472
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:19,742
The airport is very far.
Yeah. I know that, dad.

1473
01:17:19,782 --> 01:17:22,062
I will take just one bag. Please.
Hey! That is Nandini.

1474
01:17:22,862 --> 01:17:25,262
Alright! Go.
Madam…You are Nandini, right?

1475
01:17:25,342 --> 01:17:26,822
Yeah.
Ma'am! Please give me your autograph.

1476
01:17:26,902 --> 01:17:27,542
Nandini ma'am.

1477
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:28,702
Who are all of you?

1478
01:17:28,742 --> 01:17:30,142
Madam…Please madam.
Give me your autograph.

1479
01:17:30,182 --> 01:17:31,902
Madam! You're the singer of
'Crazy Boys' troupe, right?

1480
01:17:31,942 --> 01:17:33,302
We love your song, madam.

1481
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:34,862
We die for your song, madam.

1482
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,982
Madam! Your voice is similar to
Shreya Goshal in the movie.

1483
01:17:37,022 --> 01:17:39,302
Please madam. Give me your autograph.
Who are you? Go away from here.

1484
01:17:39,342 --> 01:17:41,262
Sir…Cool down.
We are from ABT College.

1485
01:17:41,302 --> 01:17:41,902
Vizag, sir.

1486
01:17:41,942 --> 01:17:44,742
Sir! Do you know? Nandini madam is famous
in our college.

1487
01:17:44,782 --> 01:17:46,622
She sang for our college's event as well.

1488
01:17:46,702 --> 01:17:48,542
Please, sir.
Let me take one selfie.

1489
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,502
Please, sir.

1490
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,662
Dad! They're asking for my autograph.

1491
01:17:51,742 --> 01:17:52,662
Did I really…?

1492
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:55,502
They are your acquaintances I believe.
They are trying to take an advantage.

1493
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:57,422
Come with me, dear.
I took a selfie with Tej sir.

1494
01:17:57,462 --> 01:17:59,382
I want to take one with you as well.
Tej?

1495
01:17:59,422 --> 01:18:00,142
Who is Tej?

1496
01:18:00,182 --> 01:18:02,182
Tej, madam.
He is the owner of 'Crazy Boys' troupe.

1497
01:18:02,222 --> 01:18:02,982
See! He's the one.

1498
01:18:04,982 --> 01:18:06,382
'Who is Tej?'

1499
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:07,862
Go! It's time for your entry.

1500
01:18:07,942 --> 01:18:10,062
Hey! Come…Come back.
What are you doing?

1501
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:11,502
Make a way.
Go away.

1502
01:18:11,702 --> 01:18:13,862
Madam…
Good news to our audience!

1503
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,702
We got to know that the
famous singer Nandini is here.

1504
01:18:16,782 --> 01:18:17,982
Go away.
Madam…Please madam.

1505
01:18:18,022 --> 01:18:18,902
Give us just one bite.

1506
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:20,502
Do it for your fans.
Madam.

1507
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:23,222
Give a bite for our channel, madam.
Please go away. Go away.

1508
01:18:23,262 --> 01:18:25,622
Madam! I am from Maya TV.
 No…

1509
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,222
Madam, one bite. Please madam.

1510
01:18:27,262 --> 01:18:28,502
Madam! Please.
Go.

1511
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:29,822
I am from Maya TV.

1512
01:18:34,222 --> 01:18:35,982
Take us to the airport fast.
No, dad.

1513
01:18:37,702 --> 01:18:39,462
I want to meet 'Crazy Boys' music troupe.

1514
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:40,302
Okay, ma'am.

1515
01:18:42,142 --> 01:18:43,502
I want to meet Tej.

1516
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:40,742
Tej.

1517
01:19:41,982 --> 01:19:42,462
Tej!

1518
01:19:52,582 --> 01:19:53,142
Tej.

1519
01:19:54,662 --> 01:19:55,902
Won't you talk with me?

1520
01:19:55,942 --> 01:19:56,542
Talk with you?

1521
01:19:56,582 --> 01:19:58,022
Why will he talk with you?
Hey!

1522
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:00,342
What have you done?

1523
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:02,182
We practice music like a family.

1524
01:20:02,462 --> 01:20:06,102
But, you failed to recognize him
when he came to see you at the hospital.

1525
01:20:06,662 --> 01:20:08,022
It's a medical miracle. You know?

1526
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:09,902
I lost my memory because of an accident.

1527
01:20:09,982 --> 01:20:13,262
Did you forget to have food?
Did you forget to sleep?

1528
01:20:13,302 --> 01:20:15,182
How can you forget Tej like that?
How?

1529
01:20:15,502 --> 01:20:16,822
Do you know how hurt we are?

1530
01:20:16,862 --> 01:20:17,662
I can't believe this.

1531
01:20:17,702 --> 01:20:19,902
God! This must be crazy.
Stop it, man.

1532
01:20:21,742 --> 01:20:22,862
What is your problem?

1533
01:20:22,942 --> 01:20:25,662
Actually! I don't know what to say.

1534
01:20:26,462 --> 01:20:30,302
But, I somehow feel like joining your troupe.

1535
01:20:30,902 --> 01:20:32,102
Listen! Don't do that.

1536
01:20:32,142 --> 01:20:32,582
Why?

1537
01:20:32,782 --> 01:20:34,662
The entire programme is a flop
because of you.

1538
01:20:34,742 --> 01:20:36,102
I fired you.

1539
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,782
Listen! Remove her picture from the hoarding.
Yes. We shall remove it.

1540
01:20:39,462 --> 01:20:40,582
It's done…

1541
01:20:40,662 --> 01:20:42,302
Please don't disturb again.

1542
01:20:42,582 --> 01:20:44,582
Hey mister! Mind your words.

1543
01:20:44,662 --> 01:20:45,942
I will teach him a lesson.

1544
01:20:46,702 --> 01:20:49,422
You would understand my feelings
if you're in my shoes, sir.

1545
01:20:49,462 --> 01:20:51,702
I became a state singer from a street singer.

1546
01:20:51,782 --> 01:20:53,622
Many companies wanted me to do an album.

1547
01:20:55,662 --> 01:20:57,582
Nandini joined the troupe by requesting us.

1548
01:20:57,622 --> 01:20:59,582
She was the main singer and
she practiced too.

1549
01:20:59,782 --> 01:21:01,262
There's a tour in Vizag after 15 days.

1550
01:21:01,342 --> 01:21:03,622
What can we do
if she suddenly doesn't remember anything?

1551
01:21:04,302 --> 01:21:05,422
Why are you talking to her, buddy?

1552
01:21:05,862 --> 01:21:06,862
Go away from here.

1553
01:21:08,222 --> 01:21:10,102
Do you think that we cannot find
another singer?

1554
01:21:10,182 --> 01:21:10,742
Leave now.

1555
01:21:12,302 --> 01:21:13,022
Idiots!

1556
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:13,902
Let's go, dear.

1557
01:21:13,982 --> 01:21:14,942
Come. Let's go.

1558
01:21:17,382 --> 01:21:18,542
Didn't I do the right thing?

1559
01:21:20,262 --> 01:21:22,382
I tell you. Let's go with plan B.

1560
01:21:24,262 --> 01:21:26,942
Nandini! Good that you're here.
I am from Maya TV.

1561
01:21:27,022 --> 01:21:28,422
Give us one bite, madam.

1562
01:21:28,462 --> 01:21:30,342
Hey! Why are you following us everywhere?
Go away from here.

1563
01:21:30,382 --> 01:21:31,302
Why are you saying that, sir?

1564
01:21:31,342 --> 01:21:33,502
Your daughter is the lead singer for
the next music album.

1565
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,702
Madam…Please.
You! Dad.

1566
01:21:34,782 --> 01:21:36,262
Madam! Please give us one bite.

1567
01:21:36,302 --> 01:21:37,342
Madam. Please madam.

1568
01:21:37,422 --> 01:21:38,302
Just one bite.

1569
01:21:38,502 --> 01:21:39,622
What should I say?

1570
01:21:56,382 --> 01:21:57,702
Nandini! Let's go.

1571
01:21:58,182 --> 01:21:59,622
I understood everything, dad.

1572
01:21:59,742 --> 01:22:01,982
I loved music since my childhood.

1573
01:22:03,022 --> 01:22:05,982
I must've fulfilled my wish
before meeting this guy.

1574
01:22:06,062 --> 01:22:08,382
I must've joined their group
and became famous.

1575
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:10,382
Whatever you think hasn't happened.

1576
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:11,902
Look at his face.

1577
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,742
He looks like he hasn't eaten
anything for months.

1578
01:22:16,662 --> 01:22:18,142
Particularly, look at that fatso.

1579
01:22:23,502 --> 01:22:25,982
Does he look like a musician?

1580
01:22:26,622 --> 01:22:27,702
Listen to me.

1581
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:29,142
This is just a waste of time.

1582
01:22:29,222 --> 01:22:30,062
Let's go.

1583
01:22:31,742 --> 01:22:32,702
Please, dad.

1584
01:22:32,742 --> 01:22:33,862
It is just for 15 days.

1585
01:22:33,902 --> 01:22:35,382
I will come after finishing the show.

1586
01:22:37,022 --> 01:22:37,702
No, dear.

1587
01:22:38,022 --> 01:22:38,822
I will not agree.

1588
01:22:39,102 --> 01:22:39,862
Let's go now.

1589
01:22:42,862 --> 01:22:44,142
Don't force her too much.

1590
01:22:44,422 --> 01:22:46,542
She will remember everything
if she gets any doubt.

1591
01:22:50,022 --> 01:22:51,782
Okay, dear. You can go.

1592
01:22:57,502 --> 01:22:58,022
Tej.

1593
01:22:58,822 --> 01:23:00,342
I will sing in your group.

1594
01:23:00,622 --> 01:23:02,182
I will come for the practice for 15 days.

1595
01:23:02,222 --> 01:23:03,462
You will come?
You won't come.

1596
01:23:03,502 --> 01:23:05,702
You will meet with an accident again.

1597
01:23:05,742 --> 01:23:08,022
What will happen to us
if you lose your memory? Say, madam.

1598
01:23:08,782 --> 01:23:10,462
I will sign the agreement if you want.

1599
01:23:12,222 --> 01:23:14,902
She didn't change at all even
after losing her memory.

1600
01:23:17,022 --> 01:23:18,222
Show me the agreement.

1601
01:23:24,982 --> 01:23:26,702
I will come for the practice from tomorrow.

1602
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:27,382
Hmm.

1603
01:23:27,422 --> 01:23:28,742
Okay? Bye.

1604
01:23:29,662 --> 01:23:30,142
Hmm.

1605
01:23:43,582 --> 01:23:44,222
Stop it.

1606
01:23:44,302 --> 01:23:45,662
What happened, buddy?
Listen!

1607
01:23:45,742 --> 01:23:47,582
She agreed to stay with us for 15 days.

1608
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:50,582
Find out why she came to India and
what her problem is in these 15 days.

1609
01:23:50,742 --> 01:23:52,622
Does it mean that there isn't any love story?

1610
01:23:53,622 --> 01:23:57,462
What's the problem when you try for a little
but you receive a lot?

1611
01:23:57,502 --> 01:24:00,542
Then, allow us to make a plan.
You just follow it.

1612
01:24:00,622 --> 01:24:02,062
Understand?
Okay.

1613
01:24:19,862 --> 01:24:20,302
Hi.

1614
01:24:23,902 --> 01:24:25,302
I am telling you. Obey my order.

1615
01:24:27,582 --> 01:24:28,702
Come on, guys.

1616
01:24:56,942 --> 01:24:57,742
Come out.

1617
01:24:58,222 --> 01:24:59,902
I will smack you. Come out of it.

1618
01:25:01,022 --> 01:25:02,742
Who composed this?

1619
01:25:03,862 --> 01:25:04,462
Oh!

1620
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:09,742
What's the scale that I should follow?
Small or big scale.

1621
01:25:09,782 --> 01:25:11,102
Pick whatever you want.

1622
01:25:11,222 --> 01:25:12,782
Where should I get the scales from?

1623
01:25:27,942 --> 01:25:28,662
Go out.

1624
01:25:29,102 --> 01:25:29,782
Please, buddy.

1625
01:25:29,862 --> 01:25:30,702
Get out. Now!

1626
01:25:30,942 --> 01:25:32,422
Okay, guys. I'll be back.

1627
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,262
Photo…

1628
01:25:42,822 --> 01:25:44,182
Just a small break, ma'am.

1629
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,222
Please.
Okay.

1630
01:25:48,982 --> 01:25:49,782
Yes.

1631
01:25:55,582 --> 01:25:56,102
Harsh!

1632
01:25:56,982 --> 01:25:57,542
Yeah.

1633
01:25:58,622 --> 01:25:59,662
What happened, Nandini?

1634
01:26:00,662 --> 01:26:01,862
This picture?

1635
01:26:05,982 --> 01:26:09,022
This is one of those sweet memories of
your story.

1636
01:26:10,342 --> 01:26:12,822
Tej saw you in a train for the first time.

1637
01:26:13,662 --> 01:26:15,342
He tried to talk to you.

1638
01:26:15,662 --> 01:26:18,422
But, you didn't give him a chance.

1639
01:26:19,062 --> 01:26:21,182
That poor guy tried a lot.

1640
01:26:21,462 --> 01:26:22,862
He made a plan to attract you.

1641
01:26:22,942 --> 01:26:23,942
Plan is made.

1642
01:26:34,582 --> 01:26:35,422
Hey!

1643
01:26:35,782 --> 01:26:37,022
Excuse me.

1644
01:26:37,142 --> 01:26:38,062
How do I look?

1645
01:26:38,102 --> 01:26:38,502
Ah?

1646
01:26:39,022 --> 01:26:41,102
You might look like anything.
How does it matter to me?

1647
01:26:41,862 --> 01:26:44,942
Nothing, madam. I want to propose to a girl.

1648
01:26:45,102 --> 01:26:46,862
Do it if you want. Why are you telling me?

1649
01:26:47,862 --> 01:26:52,302
That is because a beautiful girl
like you will have an amazing taste.

1650
01:26:52,542 --> 01:26:55,742
Give me few tips and
I will flatter her easily.

1651
01:27:02,662 --> 01:27:06,542
Remove this floral shirt and
wear something classy.

1652
01:27:09,022 --> 01:27:11,102
Remove your bottom and wear jeans.

1653
01:27:11,182 --> 01:27:11,862
Okay, madam.

1654
01:27:12,302 --> 01:27:14,742
What's that? You hair looks like a nest.

1655
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:15,742
Go for a haircut.

1656
01:27:16,302 --> 01:27:18,462
And that beauty spot. Remove it.

1657
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:22,702
You have to change your body language.

1658
01:27:24,342 --> 01:27:25,942
Listen to romantic songs.

1659
01:27:26,982 --> 01:27:28,782
You will look good after that.

1660
01:27:29,062 --> 01:27:31,102
Any girl will easily get impressed.

1661
01:27:31,182 --> 01:27:31,982
Okay, madam.

1662
01:27:32,142 --> 01:27:32,902
All the best!

1663
01:27:37,342 --> 01:27:39,302
You passed by that road the very next day.

1664
01:27:42,982 --> 01:27:46,062

1670

1671
01:28:12,182 --> 01:28:14,382
What about your girl?

1672
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:15,342
Oh!

1673
01:28:16,622 --> 01:28:18,382
'Better luck next time.'

1674
01:28:37,542 --> 01:28:39,982
You joined our troupe after that.

1675
01:28:41,102 --> 01:28:43,302
We've done many programmes in
several colleges.

1676
01:28:43,382 --> 01:28:47,782

1686
01:29:25,222 --> 01:29:26,782
Did all of that happen between us?

1687
01:29:26,822 --> 01:29:28,422
'That poor guy doesn't know about it.'

1688
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:29,342
'Goal!'

1689
01:29:38,022 --> 01:29:38,622
Hello.

1690
01:29:39,102 --> 01:29:40,022
Where is everyone?

1691
01:29:40,222 --> 01:29:41,662
Do we have a practice today or not?

1692
01:29:41,702 --> 01:29:44,142
Hey! We will reach there in half an hour.
Do something.

1693
01:29:44,182 --> 01:29:46,542
You stay there. Don't go anywhere.
Did you lock the room?

1694
01:29:46,862 --> 01:29:48,142
No, buddy! I forgot.

1695
01:29:48,582 --> 01:29:49,902
Buddy! You know, right?

1696
01:29:49,942 --> 01:29:51,982
Tej doesn't like it when someone
enters the room.

1697
01:29:52,022 --> 01:29:53,582
That is because there are
many lovely memories in that room.

1698
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:54,902
Hey! End the call.

1699
01:29:54,942 --> 01:29:56,822
Hey…I forgot.
Oh no! I will end it.

1700
01:30:16,822 --> 01:30:17,422
No!

1701
01:30:17,782 --> 01:30:19,222
Hey.
No. No.

1702
01:30:19,262 --> 01:30:20,822
No. No!
Harsh! Please.

1703
01:30:20,862 --> 01:30:21,782
Please listen to me.

1704
01:30:21,902 --> 01:30:23,222
Tell me something about this picture.

1705
01:30:23,342 --> 01:30:24,702
Please, Harsh. Please tell me.

1706
01:30:24,782 --> 01:30:27,262
Hey! I will kill you if you do not say it.

1707
01:30:27,342 --> 01:30:28,142
I will tell you…

1708
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:30,982
We were doing music programmes
and something happened one day.

1709
01:30:31,062 --> 01:30:31,702
That day…

1710
01:30:52,782 --> 01:30:54,982
Who wants this 2000 rupees note?

1711
01:30:55,022 --> 01:30:58,462
'Me…I want it.'
'I want it…'

1712
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:02,822
Who wants this 2000 rupees note?

1713
01:31:02,982 --> 01:31:04,222
'Me…'

1714
01:31:04,342 --> 01:31:05,342
Thanks, sister.

1715
01:31:05,822 --> 01:31:06,382
'Oh!'

1716
01:31:06,662 --> 01:31:07,142
'Oh, no!'

1717
01:31:08,102 --> 01:31:08,942
Did you see that?

1718
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:11,382
Everyone raised their hands when I asked.

1719
01:31:11,742 --> 01:31:14,422
But, Bunty took it away from me.

1720
01:31:14,822 --> 01:31:16,262
Why haven't you all taken it from me?

1721
01:31:16,342 --> 01:31:17,982
We thought that you were kidding.

1722
01:31:18,022 --> 01:31:19,742
I thought about it and that kid
came before me.

1723
01:31:19,782 --> 01:31:21,022
Life is similar to it.

1724
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:23,102
Someone might take the things you like
before you do.

1725
01:31:23,302 --> 01:31:26,662
That is why you shouldn't hold
anything to your heart.

1726
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:28,222
You have to express it.

1727
01:31:28,502 --> 01:31:30,102
Take whatever you like.

1728
01:31:30,342 --> 01:31:32,662
Be it money or love.

1729
01:31:33,982 --> 01:31:36,622
Sister! Tej asked me to take that note
from you.

1730
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:47,222
Hey…

1731
01:31:51,822 --> 01:31:53,742
Tej! I love you.

1732
01:31:55,382 --> 01:31:57,302
Why didn't you tell me that day about this?

1733
01:31:57,622 --> 01:32:00,862
It would be embarrassing to make
you remember everything after you forgot.

1734
01:32:01,062 --> 01:32:02,222
That is why…
Tej refused to say it.

1735
01:32:07,382 --> 01:32:11,902
<font color="#FF00FF"><i>♪ You! My heart starts to love ♪</i></font>

01:32:48,662 --> 01:32:50,982

1746
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:02,582
No! This is wrong.

1747
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:03,702
Why did you lie?

1748
01:33:03,742 --> 01:33:06,462
Hey! It is true that you proposed Nandini
before the accident.

1749
01:33:06,502 --> 01:33:08,742
There's a chance that
she might accept your proposal.

1750
01:33:08,822 --> 01:33:10,622
Just think if it happens in real.

1751
01:33:10,662 --> 01:33:12,422
Listen, bro. True love never fails.

1752
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:14,822
Nandini may not remember anything.
But, love remains in her heart.

1753
01:33:14,862 --> 01:33:16,702
Our plan is to make her recall that love.

1754
01:33:16,742 --> 01:33:19,262
Tej! Nandini will not come back
if she leaves.

1755
01:33:19,422 --> 01:33:21,382
Whatever we do,
we should do it within these 15 days.

1756
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:23,182
Otherwise,
you will have to repent all your life.

1757
01:33:23,222 --> 01:33:24,342
No, buddy.
Listen to me.

1758
01:33:24,382 --> 01:33:25,702
It won't be good
if we do not do something like this.

1759
01:33:25,782 --> 01:33:28,022
Moreover, everything is fair in love and war.
Yes, buddy.

1760
01:33:31,302 --> 01:33:31,702
Hmm?

1761
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:32,302
Hmm.

1762
01:33:33,102 --> 01:33:33,502
Hmm?

1763
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:34,302
Hmm.

1764
01:33:35,222 --> 01:33:36,022
Yeah!

1765
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:43,062
Buddy!
I guess she's coming to express her love.

1766
01:33:45,822 --> 01:33:48,662
Hey! I'm not a magician to handle
all the musicians.

1767
01:33:48,742 --> 01:33:50,502
There is a limit for everything, guys.

1768
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:51,862
Excuse me.
Hey! Don't disturb.

1769
01:33:51,902 --> 01:33:53,062
Oh! Nandini.
Is that you?

1770
01:33:53,102 --> 01:33:54,942
What a surprise!
Come…

1771
01:33:55,862 --> 01:33:57,742
I want to talk to Tej personally.

1772
01:33:57,822 --> 01:33:59,102
Can you all please go out?

1773
01:33:59,142 --> 01:34:00,902
Oh! Sure. Why not?
Let's go, guys. Come.

1774
01:34:01,822 --> 01:34:02,862
All the best, buddy.
All the best.

1775
01:34:16,382 --> 01:34:18,542
I've been trying to meet you since morning.

1776
01:34:19,342 --> 01:34:21,942
It is true that we were in love?

1777
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:23,262
That is…

1778
01:34:23,462 --> 01:34:24,102
We…

1779
01:34:24,662 --> 01:34:25,382
Say it.

1780
01:34:27,502 --> 01:34:29,222
Did I love you?

1781
01:34:29,942 --> 01:34:31,502
Did I wear a ring on you?

1782
01:34:37,102 --> 01:34:39,382
Yeah! We loved each other.

1783
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:42,102
What is this, then?

1784
01:34:45,782 --> 01:34:47,062
There's a misunderstanding.

1785
01:34:47,102 --> 01:34:48,942
He is not my boyfriend. He is my assistant.

1786
01:34:49,302 --> 01:34:50,982
I got to know the truth about you.

1787
01:34:51,062 --> 01:34:53,342
You forgot your phone
when you came to drop me.

1788
01:34:54,382 --> 01:34:55,782
You've cheated me.

1789
01:34:55,942 --> 01:34:57,702
You and your friends deceived me.

1790
01:34:57,782 --> 01:35:00,342
Following you and taking an advantage of you…

1791
01:35:00,462 --> 01:35:01,702
Singing in your troupe…

1792
01:35:01,822 --> 01:35:03,782
Falling in love with you…
Everything is a lie.

1793
01:35:04,102 --> 01:35:05,062
Aren't you ashamed?

1794
01:35:06,942 --> 01:35:09,782
How can you deceive someone like
that to make them love you?

1795
01:35:11,142 --> 01:35:13,902
I might consider everything to be true
and love you.

1796
01:35:14,262 --> 01:35:15,902
But, what will you gain with
that kind of love?

1797
01:35:16,422 --> 01:35:17,022
No. I…

1798
01:35:17,662 --> 01:35:18,102
Damn!

1799
01:35:18,142 --> 01:35:19,342
Nandu! Listen to me once.

1800
01:35:20,062 --> 01:35:21,342
Don't tell me anything.

1801
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:24,862
Goodbye.

1802
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:41,142
It was my mistake, buddy.

1803
01:35:44,502 --> 01:35:46,702
It might be anyone's mistake
but is still a mistake.

1804
01:35:47,702 --> 01:35:48,862
You are sad, buddy.

1805
01:35:49,542 --> 01:35:52,662
I am sad. But, my love is incomplete.

1806
01:35:54,102 --> 01:35:55,262
Buddy! Give me your phone.

1807
01:35:55,942 --> 01:35:56,542
Why, buddy?

1808
01:35:58,262 --> 01:36:00,102
She doesn't have your number, right?
No.

1809
01:36:00,182 --> 01:36:00,782
Okay.

1810
01:36:00,862 --> 01:36:01,622
But…

1811
01:36:06,822 --> 01:36:09,382
'Nandini! Come to
Meherbaba Ashram immediately.'

1812
01:36:09,822 --> 01:36:10,622
'Gangadhar.'

1813
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:13,662
Who is it in the picture, mom?

1814
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:18,022
He is orphan school's principal
Mr. Gangadhar.

1815
01:36:18,222 --> 01:36:20,502
I studied in their school during
my childhood.

1816
01:36:21,862 --> 01:36:24,302
Driver. Do you know
where Meherbaba Ashram is?

1817
01:36:24,342 --> 01:36:25,262
Take me there.

1818
01:36:25,302 --> 01:36:27,102
Buddy! What kind of message was that?

1819
01:36:27,582 --> 01:36:30,982
I dropped Nandu at the ashram
when she was with me.

1820
01:36:31,022 --> 01:36:34,542
'There must be a connection.
She came to India and went there twice.'

1821
01:36:35,142 --> 01:36:36,702
That is why I sent her this message.

1822
01:36:37,182 --> 01:36:38,622
We might find a clue over there.

1823
01:36:38,662 --> 01:36:39,182
What is it, buddy?

1824
01:36:39,462 --> 01:36:41,062
A lot has happened.
Is it really required now?

1825
01:36:41,342 --> 01:36:42,622
Why should we care about where she goes?

1826
01:36:42,782 --> 01:36:43,302
Leave it, buddy.

1827
01:36:43,982 --> 01:36:44,422
Hey!

1828
01:36:44,902 --> 01:36:46,462
Nandu doesn't love me.

1829
01:36:46,622 --> 01:36:49,102
Should I let her go just because
of that reason?

1830
01:36:49,502 --> 01:36:51,182
Her father is her enemy.

1831
01:36:51,302 --> 01:36:52,582
Who will help her, then?

1832
01:36:55,022 --> 01:36:55,582
Let's go.

1833
01:36:55,662 --> 01:36:56,382
Yeah.

1834
01:37:02,622 --> 01:37:04,222
I am astonished.

1835
01:37:04,342 --> 01:37:06,222
Did all of it just in a week?
Sir.

1836
01:37:06,742 --> 01:37:08,062
Why did I come to India?

1837
01:37:08,862 --> 01:37:10,302
Why did I come to meet you?

1838
01:37:10,662 --> 01:37:11,782
I will tell you, dear.

1839
01:37:12,022 --> 01:37:13,622
<font color="#FFD700">(<< REWIND <<)</font>

1840
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:17,702
Your mom called me one day before her death.

1841
01:37:17,942 --> 01:37:19,942
She asked me to help you when you come here.

1842
01:37:20,942 --> 01:37:24,462
She asked me to find that guy
and give these documents.

1843
01:37:24,742 --> 01:37:27,542
After that, I got to hear about her death.

1844
01:37:27,662 --> 01:37:28,742
I felt very sad.

1845
01:37:29,382 --> 01:37:31,262
You came to me after that.

1846
01:37:31,622 --> 01:37:35,902
We went to the Boston school in
Vizag to find the address of that guy.

1847
01:37:36,022 --> 01:37:37,742
Madam! The document
that you're talking about…

1848
01:37:37,982 --> 01:37:41,302
It got burnt in a fire accident.

1849
01:37:42,422 --> 01:37:43,822
But, we can do something.

1850
01:37:43,902 --> 01:37:46,502
There's a PT teacher named Murthy.

1851
01:37:46,622 --> 01:37:48,142
He was very close to the kids.

1852
01:37:48,382 --> 01:37:50,782
You can get some information if you meet him.

1853
01:37:52,222 --> 01:37:53,342
Where will I find him?

1854
01:37:53,422 --> 01:37:55,422
Murthy sir is a famous coach now.

1855
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:58,902
He's the coach for the international
cricket league who sponsors.

1856
01:37:58,942 --> 01:38:00,142
His office is in Hyderabad.

1857
01:38:00,222 --> 01:38:01,262
Go there and inquire.

1858
01:38:01,302 --> 01:38:03,902
You went to their office and
did the inquiry after that.

1859
01:38:04,182 --> 01:38:08,862
You came to me and said that Mr. Murthy is
coming to Vizag on 20th of this month.

1860
01:38:09,022 --> 01:38:11,822
After that, you came here to meet me again.

1861
01:38:12,982 --> 01:38:13,662
That means…

1862
01:38:14,542 --> 01:38:18,142
I came to India to fulfill
my mom's last wish.

1863
01:38:18,742 --> 01:38:19,502
Yes, dear.

1864
01:38:19,822 --> 01:38:21,622
Dad is very selfish.

1865
01:38:22,822 --> 01:38:25,502
He hid everything from me
for the sake of money.

1866
01:38:25,982 --> 01:38:27,222
Forget whatever has happened.

1867
01:38:27,662 --> 01:38:30,342
By the God's grace, you found out everything.

1868
01:38:30,622 --> 01:38:32,862
Now, you have to think about fulfilling
your mom's wish.

1869
01:38:33,022 --> 01:38:33,782
Yes, sir.

1870
01:38:34,022 --> 01:38:36,822
You said that coach Murthy will come to Vizag
in 20 days.

1871
01:38:37,262 --> 01:38:38,822
15 days are gone already.

1872
01:38:39,102 --> 01:38:42,102
You can meet Mr. Murthy
if you wait for 5 more days.

1873
01:38:42,302 --> 01:38:44,102
You can find something about that guy.

1874
01:38:46,902 --> 01:38:47,342
Yeah.

1875
01:38:51,182 --> 01:38:52,022
Come.

1876
01:38:54,302 --> 01:38:54,782
Hey. Wait.

1877
01:38:54,822 --> 01:38:56,382
Here. Take the documents.

1878
01:39:01,702 --> 01:39:03,262
I'll leave, sir.
Okay, dear.

1879
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:06,182
Let's go…

1880
01:39:06,982 --> 01:39:07,942
Nandini!

1881
01:39:09,982 --> 01:39:13,142
If you father finds out that you came here…

1882
01:39:13,182 --> 01:39:14,382
Then, he will take you back to London.

1883
01:39:14,422 --> 01:39:15,462
It won't happen that way, sir.

1884
01:39:15,502 --> 01:39:17,382
I will manage my dad these 5 days.

1885
01:39:17,422 --> 01:39:19,062
I will go to Vizag without going to London.

1886
01:39:20,502 --> 01:39:22,502
What is this?
Why does she want to go to Vizag now?

1887
01:39:22,822 --> 01:39:25,262
Why is she planning to go to
Vizag to stay away from her dad?

1888
01:39:25,582 --> 01:39:26,622
Nandini's dad is here.

1889
01:39:26,822 --> 01:39:27,262
Ah?

1890
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:28,182
What ah?

1891
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:29,342
Nandini's dad is here.

1892
01:39:33,062 --> 01:39:34,582
'Dad is at music band office.'

1893
01:39:45,262 --> 01:39:46,342
Sir! What are you doing here?

1894
01:39:46,422 --> 01:39:47,302
Where is my daughter?

1895
01:39:48,622 --> 01:39:49,182
That is…Actually!

1896
01:39:49,262 --> 01:39:51,942
She should either be with me
or come here for the rehearsal.

1897
01:39:52,382 --> 01:39:53,102
Where is she?

1898
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:55,462
She is not picking my call.

1899
01:39:56,062 --> 01:39:57,622
You've got us sign the documents.

1900
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:00,062
If something happens to her…

1901
01:40:02,862 --> 01:40:04,582
Don't you feel responsible?

1902
01:40:05,022 --> 01:40:07,182
He whistled but hasn't she come?
She will come.

1903
01:40:07,302 --> 01:40:08,102
Dad!

1904
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:09,622
When did you come here?
What is it, dear?

1905
01:40:09,662 --> 01:40:11,582
Where were you?
Do you know? I was so tensed.

1906
01:40:11,782 --> 01:40:13,622
Tej! Haven't you told my dad?

1907
01:40:14,902 --> 01:40:16,462
We went for the practice, right?

1908
01:40:16,502 --> 01:40:17,502
Yeah…That's right.

1909
01:40:19,102 --> 01:40:21,182
Dad! Tej is a very good composer.

1910
01:40:21,222 --> 01:40:22,382
He'll become like A.R. Rahman one day.

1911
01:40:23,062 --> 01:40:25,422
Do you know?
He planned the music programme very well.

1912
01:40:25,542 --> 01:40:27,142
We have to go to Vizag immediately.

1913
01:40:27,182 --> 01:40:27,742
Oh!

1914
01:40:28,702 --> 01:40:29,302
Vizag?

1915
01:40:29,382 --> 01:40:31,342
Why should you go to Vizag?
You have to practice here, right?

1916
01:40:31,702 --> 01:40:33,262
The plan has changed, dad.

1917
01:40:34,062 --> 01:40:34,982
Isn't it, Tej?

1918
01:40:36,502 --> 01:40:37,302
Yeah…Indeed!

1919
01:40:37,582 --> 01:40:38,502
Yeah.

1920
01:40:38,622 --> 01:40:40,502
She shouted at you earlier.
She is talking sweetly now.

1921
01:40:40,542 --> 01:40:41,302
What's the matter?

1922
01:40:41,342 --> 01:40:43,822
She should go to Vizag secretly
without letting her dad know.

1923
01:40:44,022 --> 01:40:46,262
That is why she made up a story now.
O' God!

1924
01:40:46,822 --> 01:40:47,702
See what I will do.

1925
01:40:47,982 --> 01:40:50,822
Sir! Our programme is cancelled.

1926
01:40:51,222 --> 01:40:53,662
You can take back your daughter to London.

1927
01:40:53,742 --> 01:40:54,182
Hey!

1928
01:40:54,222 --> 01:40:56,302
Hey! Be silent. Let me talk.

1929
01:40:57,822 --> 01:40:58,502
Madam.

1930
01:40:59,502 --> 01:41:00,182
Go.

1931
01:41:00,302 --> 01:41:01,142
Why are you still sitting?

1932
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:02,022
What happened?

1933
01:41:02,062 --> 01:41:03,062
He has no mood.

1934
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,182
He failed in love.

1935
01:41:04,262 --> 01:41:05,102
His heart is broken.

1936
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:06,022
He will not do the programme.

1937
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:07,702
Sir! You may go if you want to.

1938
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,102
Is it good?

1939
01:41:09,222 --> 01:41:10,982
Let's go, dear. We shall go away from here.

1940
01:41:11,142 --> 01:41:12,222
One minute, dad.

1941
01:41:13,382 --> 01:41:14,422
What happened, Tej?

1942
01:41:14,502 --> 01:41:15,902
Did you break-up?

1943
01:41:16,022 --> 01:41:17,062
Why haven't you told me?

1944
01:41:17,102 --> 01:41:18,302
Tell me who that girl is.

1945
01:41:18,382 --> 01:41:20,582
I will talk to her and convince her.
That won't happen. She is very stubborn.

1946
01:41:20,622 --> 01:41:21,582
She is very selfish.

1947
01:41:21,622 --> 01:41:23,662
She can do anything to gain what she wants.

1948
01:41:23,782 --> 01:41:25,862
She is a liar.
You cannot convince her.

1949
01:41:25,942 --> 01:41:28,462
'What is it? He is talking too much.'

1950
01:41:28,502 --> 01:41:30,502
'It is a lie if it is us and
is charity if you do it?'

1951
01:41:30,542 --> 01:41:31,822
Can you tell a lie?

1952
01:41:31,862 --> 01:41:34,222
What are you saying?
Meherbaba Ashram!

1953
01:41:36,142 --> 01:41:37,582
Did you hear?
Yeah.

1954
01:41:37,742 --> 01:41:40,502
We know everything and
the reason why you're going to Vizag.

1955
01:41:41,022 --> 01:41:43,062
Please. I will give money whatever you ask.

1956
01:41:43,102 --> 01:41:44,142
Take me there. Please.

1957
01:41:44,222 --> 01:41:44,862
Please?

1958
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:46,062
Money?
Will you give money?

1959
01:41:46,182 --> 01:41:48,062
Do you think we are that cheap?

1960
01:41:48,142 --> 01:41:50,022
Sir! Your daughter is going to Vizag.
Please…Please.

1961
01:41:50,062 --> 01:41:51,622
Sorry. I said that in haste.

1962
01:41:51,662 --> 01:41:53,102
Please take me there. Please.
What happened, dear?

1963
01:41:53,142 --> 01:41:54,422
What's that discussion going on there?

1964
01:41:54,462 --> 01:41:56,022
Is your Vizag programme on or off?

1965
01:42:02,302 --> 01:42:04,342
Dad is coming. Please.
Will you take me?

1966
01:42:04,382 --> 01:42:05,782
I'm losing it. Say yes.

1967
01:42:05,822 --> 01:42:07,222
Okay, sir. The programme is confirmed.

1968
01:42:07,262 --> 01:42:09,222
We will take your daughter to Vizag.
Tej will pick her.

1969
01:42:09,262 --> 01:42:10,142
Get her ready.

1970
01:42:10,342 --> 01:42:12,742
Dad! Come to Vizag on 20th.

1971
01:42:12,862 --> 01:42:14,782
We shall go back to London that day.

1972
01:42:41,782 --> 01:42:42,302
Hello.

1973
01:42:42,702 --> 01:42:44,502
This isn't a Taxi for you to sit at the back.

1974
01:42:44,622 --> 01:42:45,542
Come and sit in the front seat.

1975
01:42:53,662 --> 01:42:54,982
So, Nandu! Did you eat something?

1976
01:42:55,542 --> 01:42:57,862
Hello! Don't talk rubbish.

1977
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,262
There is no relation between is.

1978
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:01,342
It is just the agreement.

1979
01:43:01,422 --> 01:43:03,342
After reaching Vizag…
Our ways will get departed.

1980
01:43:03,422 --> 01:43:03,982
Do you get it?

1981
01:43:04,062 --> 01:43:05,062
Yeah.
Let's go.

1982
01:43:05,502 --> 01:43:06,102
I understood.

1983
01:43:14,622 --> 01:43:16,222
<font color="#FFD700">(RADIO PLAYING)</font>

1984
01:43:55,262 --> 01:43:56,102
Are you crazy?

1985
01:44:39,622 --> 01:44:40,742
What did you say?

1986
01:44:41,342 --> 01:44:44,302
Our ways will get departed
after reaching Vizag?

1987
01:44:44,742 --> 01:44:46,262
This is just a sample.

1988
01:44:46,422 --> 01:44:50,142
I will give you a heart attack
before reaching Vizag.

1989
01:44:58,502 --> 01:44:59,502
I will kill you.

1990
01:45:00,262 --> 01:45:00,742
Sorry.

1991
01:45:01,942 --> 01:45:03,102
Fill the tank.

1992
01:45:29,582 --> 01:45:30,302
Yes, sister.

1993
01:45:30,582 --> 01:45:32,302
Listen, Tej! Mom's health is getting worse.

1994
01:45:32,382 --> 01:45:32,822
What?

1995
01:45:32,862 --> 01:45:34,142
Come fast from wherever you are.

1996
01:45:34,262 --> 01:45:35,062
You'll come, right?

1997
01:45:35,142 --> 01:45:36,542
Yeah! I am coming.

1998
01:46:05,542 --> 01:46:06,062
Hey.

1999
01:46:06,782 --> 01:46:07,382
Hey!

2000
01:46:07,782 --> 01:46:09,022
O' Man!

2001
01:46:10,622 --> 01:46:11,382
Where are you going?

2002
01:46:11,742 --> 01:46:12,742
I have an important work.

2003
01:46:12,822 --> 01:46:14,102
Wait for half an hour. I will come back.

2004
01:46:14,182 --> 01:46:15,102
I will go with you.

2005
01:46:15,342 --> 01:46:16,822
Where will you come?
I will come.

2006
01:46:16,902 --> 01:46:19,742
What's that immediate work for you
to go leaving me all alone here?

2007
01:46:19,822 --> 01:46:20,502
I am hungry.

2008
01:46:20,542 --> 01:46:22,622
I am going to eat something.
What should I do all alone here?

2009
01:46:23,422 --> 01:46:24,822
This Goddess is very powerful.

2010
01:46:24,942 --> 01:46:26,942
Pray for whatever you want.
I will come back in a while.

2011
01:46:28,622 --> 01:46:30,702
Hey, Goddess! I cannot bear this torture.

2012
01:46:30,782 --> 01:46:34,302
So, please send me away from me
as soon as possible.

2013
01:46:34,462 --> 01:46:34,902
Please.

2014
01:46:40,302 --> 01:46:41,702
'I have no idea where he's going.'

2015
01:46:57,582 --> 01:46:58,902
He is going inside like a thief.

2016
01:47:02,022 --> 01:47:04,062
Will he go to anyone's house if he is hungry?

2017
01:47:11,222 --> 01:47:12,902
Sister…

2018
01:47:13,502 --> 01:47:15,862
Tej! Happy birthday, Tej.

2019
01:47:16,382 --> 01:47:18,182
Is that why you said
that aunt's health is ill?

2020
01:47:18,222 --> 01:47:18,742
Yeah.

2021
01:47:18,862 --> 01:47:20,302
You won't come if I do not say it.

2022
01:47:20,382 --> 01:47:21,382
That is why I said that.
You!

2023
01:47:21,942 --> 01:47:22,462
Crazy.

2024
01:47:22,702 --> 01:47:24,102
What if uncle finds out?

2025
01:47:24,182 --> 01:47:25,222
Nothing will happen.

2026
01:47:25,382 --> 01:47:25,982
I am leaving.

2027
01:47:26,182 --> 01:47:28,422
Hey, Tej. Listen to me.
No. I am leaving.

2028
01:47:28,502 --> 01:47:29,022
Listen.

2029
01:47:29,422 --> 01:47:29,902
Wait.

2030
01:47:29,942 --> 01:47:30,902
Listen to me.

There is a thief in your house.

2034
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:37,422
Did he come?

2035
01:47:37,942 --> 01:47:38,662
I knew it.

2036
01:47:38,742 --> 01:47:39,862
It is his birthday.

2037
01:47:41,022 --> 01:47:42,382
Who is it, sister-in-law?

2038
01:47:42,582 --> 01:47:43,582

Did you come along with him?

2041
01:47:46,942 --> 01:47:48,022
Are they crazy?

01:47:48,102 --> 01:47:49,302
Who is it, sister?

2043
01:47:50,622 --> 01:47:51,382
This girl?

2044
01:47:51,462 --> 01:47:53,222
This is the girl that I told you about.

2045
01:47:53,422 --> 01:47:54,662
I told you that day. She is the one.

Come in, Nandini.

2048
01:47:57,742 --> 01:47:59,182
How do they know my name?

2049
01:48:01,382 --> 01:48:02,302

when he is not here? Go and sleep.

Why is he shouting like that?

2072
01:48:50,502 --> 01:48:51,142
Oh!

2073
01:48:51,902 --> 01:48:53,462
Okay. Go and sleep now.

2074
01:48:53,862 --> 01:48:54,302
Yeah.

2075
01:48:54,702 --> 01:48:55,502
Let's go, dear.

2076
01:48:57,462 --> 01:48:58,302
Hey. Wait…

2077
01:48:58,502 --> 01:49:00,862
What is it? Why did you tell him
that I'm your friend?

2078
01:49:01,102 --> 01:49:02,942
We'll be dead if you say
that you are a friend of Tej.

2079
01:49:02,982 --> 01:49:03,262
Why?

2080
01:49:03,462 --> 01:49:05,382
It was my sister's wedding last year.

2081
01:49:10,262 --> 01:49:12,382
Tej bro went away that day and came back now.

2082
01:49:12,422 --> 01:49:13,902
This is Tej's flashback.

2083
01:49:13,942 --> 01:49:14,822
Yashu!

2084
01:49:15,022 --> 01:49:16,302
I am coming, mom.

2085
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:18,102
'Oh! So, this is Tej's flashback.'

2086
01:49:18,542 --> 01:49:20,902
'There are four more days for the coach
to come to Vizag.'

2087
01:49:21,502 --> 01:49:24,902
'Tej will leave me and go
if I go away from here.'

2088
01:49:24,942 --> 01:49:27,142
'So, it is safe for me
to stay here for 4 days.'

2089
01:49:27,222 --> 01:49:28,782
'I have to do something and stay here.'

2090
01:49:29,502 --> 01:49:30,702
You made up a story and
brought me here to do this, right?

2091
01:49:30,782 --> 01:49:31,662
Shut up and eat.

2092
01:49:32,342 --> 01:49:33,582
You'd be good if you hadn't lied.

2093
01:49:33,782 --> 01:49:36,502

2095
01:49:42,582 --> 01:49:44,222

2097

2098
01:49:52,622 --> 01:49:53,222
Enough…

2099
01:49:53,262 --> 01:49:55,022
Eat…

2100
01:49:55,062 --> 01:49:56,062
<font color="#FFD700">(COUGHS)</font>

2101
01:49:56,302 --> 01:49:57,902
Hey! Come here.

2102
01:49:58,942 --> 01:49:59,782
Come.

2103
01:49:59,822 --> 01:50:00,422
Hold this.

2104
01:50:00,662 --> 01:50:01,782
Mom! She is crazy.

2105
01:50:02,502 --> 01:50:07,822
Wait for 5 minutes. I am coming.
My leg hurts. Let's go after 2 days.

2106
01:50:08,022 --> 01:50:09,462
Hey! Do you think that this is a resort?

2107
01:50:09,542 --> 01:50:11,382
Not 2 days. I will come in 2 minutes
and we shall leave.

2108
01:50:11,422 --> 01:50:12,942
What? Will you leave now?

2109
01:50:12,982 --> 01:50:14,822
Mom! It will be a problem if uncle finds out.

2110
01:50:14,862 --> 01:50:17,222
So, will you go even if I am really sick?

2111
01:50:17,462 --> 01:50:18,022
Shut up.

2112
01:50:18,702 --> 01:50:20,822
How long will you stay away like this, dear?

2113
01:50:21,062 --> 01:50:23,542
He would stay with you
if he really loves you, aunty.

2114
01:50:24,142 --> 01:50:26,102
Hey! Did she ask you?

2115
01:50:26,342 --> 01:50:27,742
Hey.
Stay back, brother.

2116
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:29,302
Stay back.

2117
01:50:30,182 --> 01:50:33,382
Stop it. Why are making it noisy?
Crazy boys! Music troupe.

2118
01:50:33,742 --> 01:50:35,422
Listen! Our neighbors turned on their lights.

2119
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:36,982
There might be a problem if someone sees you.

2120
01:50:37,782 --> 01:50:39,222
Uncle! I am leaving.

2121
01:50:39,302 --> 01:50:40,822
Hey! Go in the morning.
Go and sleep now.

2122
01:50:40,902 --> 01:50:42,142
All of you! Go to sleep.

2123
01:50:52,702 --> 01:50:53,422
Hey.

2124
01:50:54,662 --> 01:50:55,502
Get ready fast.

2125
01:50:55,542 --> 01:50:56,262
We have to go.

2126
01:50:56,302 --> 01:50:57,942
We have to leave before uncle gets up.

2127
01:50:58,062 --> 01:51:00,022
The bathroom isn't here. It is upstairs.
Go.

2128
01:51:04,222 --> 01:51:07,182
'I have to do something
and plan to stay here.'

2129
01:51:07,302 --> 01:51:09,022
'But, how?'

2130
01:51:10,982 --> 01:51:14,502
'Yes! How can he go
if he doesn't find the car keys?'

2131
01:51:25,342 --> 01:51:26,382
'Oh, no! He came.'

2132
01:51:26,622 --> 01:51:27,342
'Shit…'

2133
01:51:28,502 --> 01:51:30,982
'Oh, no! The door is locked.'

2134
01:51:31,182 --> 01:51:32,942
'What should I do now?'

2135
01:51:33,742 --> 01:51:34,582
'He is coming.'

2136
01:51:37,382 --> 01:51:38,582
Everyone is coming.

2137
01:51:39,262 --> 01:51:40,902
You say so but you will not come.

2138
01:51:40,942 --> 01:51:42,062
Uncle!

2139
01:51:49,422 --> 01:51:49,902
Get out.

2140
01:51:51,182 --> 01:51:52,342
Uncle is coming.

2141
01:51:52,422 --> 01:51:53,462
That's not my problem.

2142
01:51:53,542 --> 01:51:55,142
Then, the Vizag programme will be cancelled.

2143
01:51:55,222 --> 01:51:55,622
No!

2144
01:51:56,262 --> 01:51:56,862
No.

2145
01:51:58,582 --> 01:51:59,022
No.

2146
01:51:59,502 --> 01:52:00,102
No.

2147
01:52:01,342 --> 01:52:02,902
My purse is in the cupboard. Get it.

2148
01:52:03,262 --> 01:52:03,742
Hmm.

2149
01:52:04,822 --> 01:52:05,342
Hello.

2150
01:52:05,662 --> 01:52:06,622
Listen, carpenter.

2151
01:52:06,702 --> 01:52:08,942
My room's door has an issue.

2152
01:52:09,022 --> 01:52:10,142
Come and check it once.

2153
01:52:10,222 --> 01:52:11,702
Relatives are coming. Okay?

2154
01:52:15,542 --> 01:52:16,382
What happened, dear?

2155
01:52:16,622 --> 01:52:17,702
How did you come here?

2156
01:52:18,822 --> 01:52:20,982
Oh! Tej will you take you away.

2157
01:52:21,062 --> 01:52:22,622
That is why you are hiding here, right?

2158
01:52:22,862 --> 01:52:24,622
No problem. I will convince him.

2159
01:52:30,422 --> 01:52:31,582
Are you also here?

2160
01:52:33,542 --> 01:52:35,942
Hey! Are you talking to the cupboard?

2161
01:52:36,902 --> 01:52:38,662
Nothing. I am unable to find it.

2162
01:52:38,662 --> 01:52:40,302
You go. I will search for it and get it.

2163
01:52:40,302 --> 01:52:42,022
Okay. I will wait downstairs.

2164
01:52:48,382 --> 01:52:49,822
Hey! Come out.

2165
01:52:49,942 --> 01:52:51,062
Aunt…

2166
01:52:51,102 --> 01:52:52,862
How can you do it?

2167
01:52:52,902 --> 01:52:53,422
Aunt.

2168
01:52:53,462 --> 01:52:54,142
Shut up.

2169
01:52:57,422 --> 01:52:59,022
You should do everything after marriage.

2170
01:52:59,062 --> 01:53:00,022
Okay, aunt.

2171
01:53:03,902 --> 01:53:04,942
Hey! What's happening?

2172
01:53:05,182 --> 01:53:06,942
I will say that after the wedding.

2173
01:53:13,502 --> 01:53:14,102
Give me your hand.

2174
01:53:15,382 --> 01:53:16,262
It is not needed.

2175
01:53:19,422 --> 01:53:20,022
Uncle.

2176
01:53:22,582 --> 01:53:23,222
It is hot.

2177
01:53:23,622 --> 01:53:24,822
That's your friend, right?

2178
01:53:27,022 --> 01:53:28,302
Why is she climbing the wall?

2179
01:53:28,942 --> 01:53:30,502
I will go and see, uncle.

2180
01:53:31,582 --> 01:53:32,302
Nandini.

2181
01:53:32,702 --> 01:53:33,222
Yeah.

2182
01:53:35,182 --> 01:53:36,582
What are you doing here?

2183
01:53:36,702 --> 01:53:37,662
Hey! Come fast.

2184
01:53:39,062 --> 01:53:40,782
Hey! Uncle saw you.

2185
01:53:41,302 --> 01:53:42,742
You go.
She will come later.

2186
01:53:42,782 --> 01:53:43,702
Yeah. Okay…

2187
01:53:43,782 --> 01:53:44,862
Send her to the temple.

2188
01:53:44,942 --> 01:53:45,582
Okay…

2189
01:53:46,862 --> 01:53:49,622
Nothing, uncle. She got scared to see you.

2190
01:53:49,702 --> 01:53:52,422
Scared of me? Why, dear?

2191
01:53:54,022 --> 01:53:55,022
Mr. Vishwanath!

2192
01:53:55,302 --> 01:53:57,782
Yeah. I am coming.

2193
01:54:01,542 --> 01:54:03,182
I parked the car here.
Where is it?

2194
01:54:04,062 --> 01:54:05,062
How did it reach there?

2195
01:54:15,902 --> 01:54:18,742
Hey, you! Your uncle abandoned
you from the house that day.

2196
01:54:18,782 --> 01:54:19,942
That is why we remained silent.

2197
01:54:20,062 --> 01:54:22,422
You come back here and roam around happily.

2198
01:54:22,542 --> 01:54:23,782
How long have you been doing this?

2199
01:54:24,382 --> 01:54:25,542
Nothing like that, Ajay.

2200
01:54:25,662 --> 01:54:28,342
Hey! Call his uncle.
Ajay! Listen to me. Let it be.

2201
01:54:28,422 --> 01:54:29,022
I am going.

2202
01:54:29,102 --> 01:54:30,062
Don't call my uncle.

2203
01:54:30,142 --> 01:54:31,622
I will do whatever you ask me to. Please.

2204
01:54:31,662 --> 01:54:32,822
What will you do?

2205
01:54:51,262 --> 01:54:52,022
Tej.

2206
01:54:53,782 --> 01:54:54,582
Nandini.

2207
01:54:56,782 --> 01:54:57,822
Go away from here.

2208
01:54:58,102 --> 01:54:58,942
Tej!

2209
01:55:01,182 --> 01:55:01,662
Hey.

2210
01:55:07,382 --> 01:55:11,102
I don't have any connection with that girl.

2211
01:55:11,142 --> 01:55:12,542
Please. Don't harm her.

2212
01:55:12,582 --> 01:55:15,382
I can understand your relation with her
by the way your emotion comes out.

2213
01:55:15,422 --> 01:55:17,462
Anyway! I loved your sister since
my childhood.

2214
01:55:17,502 --> 01:55:19,622
You took her away and got her married
to someone else.

2215
01:55:19,662 --> 01:55:21,782
You didn't care about my feelings.
Ajay! I plead you do not harm her.

2216
01:55:21,822 --> 01:55:22,662
Hey! Bring her here.

2217
01:55:23,142 --> 01:55:24,342
Hey!

2218
01:56:08,542 --> 01:56:09,462
No!

2219
01:56:11,782 --> 01:56:12,582
Let him go.

2220
01:56:12,662 --> 01:56:13,062
Please…

2221
01:56:13,102 --> 01:56:15,022
Please leave him.
Nandini! You go away from here.

2222
01:57:26,142 --> 01:57:29,822
We let him go that day because
we gave respect to your words.

2223
01:57:30,102 --> 01:57:31,542
But, see what has happened.

2224
01:57:31,582 --> 01:57:34,022
Today, he came to your house
without obeying your words.

2225
01:57:34,062 --> 01:57:35,742
Also, he hit my son.

2226
01:57:35,822 --> 01:57:36,742
What will you do now?

2227
01:57:36,822 --> 01:57:38,462
Uncle isn't responsible for
what has happened.

2228
01:57:38,542 --> 01:57:40,422
He doesn't know that I came home.

2229
01:57:40,982 --> 01:57:42,422
Don't punish him for my mistake.

2230
01:57:42,462 --> 01:57:43,302
Stop it.

2231
01:57:45,142 --> 01:57:48,542
Why does he try to kill me
while I am still alive?

2232
01:57:49,702 --> 01:57:52,502
Anyway! Why am I talking to you about it?

2233
01:57:53,582 --> 01:57:56,662
In fact, all of you together deceived me.

2234
01:57:58,782 --> 01:58:01,462
Listen! It is my mistake.

2235
01:58:02,182 --> 01:58:04,302
Tell me. Whose feet should I hold?

2236
01:58:06,062 --> 01:58:08,862
There is no need for you to hold
anyone's feet, uncle. I am sorry.

2237
01:58:15,622 --> 01:58:16,382
Dad.
Stop right there.

2238
01:58:16,422 --> 01:58:18,742
You dishonest person!
Why did you come here again?

2239
01:58:18,942 --> 01:58:20,622
Both of you are the reason for this fight.

2240
01:58:20,942 --> 01:58:21,942
I will…
Listen!

2241
01:58:22,102 --> 01:58:23,462
You can say anything to me.

2242
01:58:23,502 --> 01:58:25,102
But, don't say anything to brother.
Damn! Shut your mouth.

2243
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:25,782
Swetha!

2244
01:58:25,982 --> 01:58:27,422
Sorry, brother. Don't stop me.

2245
01:58:27,502 --> 01:58:30,542
Uncle! Do you know what actually
happened that night?

2246
01:58:31,062 --> 01:58:33,702
I fell in love with a guy named Aditya.

2247
01:58:33,822 --> 01:58:36,182
That day, all of you fell asleep.

2248
01:58:36,942 --> 01:58:40,382
'I went away with Aditya
who was waiting for me, uncle.'

2249
01:58:45,782 --> 01:58:47,822
Go fast. Please go fast.

2250
01:58:49,582 --> 01:58:50,622
Hey! That's your brother.

2251
01:58:58,342 --> 01:58:58,742
Brother.

2252
01:58:58,862 --> 01:58:59,862
Brother.
Sir…Please.

2253
01:58:59,902 --> 01:59:02,302
How dare you to run away with my sister!

2254
01:59:02,382 --> 01:59:04,142
Listen!
I asked him to come, brother.

2255
01:59:04,182 --> 01:59:04,702
Hey! Shut up.

2256
01:59:04,822 --> 01:59:05,702
How can you make such decision?

2257
01:59:05,822 --> 01:59:07,222
Are you that old enough? Huh?

2258
01:59:07,302 --> 01:59:09,622
I love him more than my life, brother.

2259
01:59:09,662 --> 01:59:10,982
You should say that earlier
if that is the case.

2260
01:59:11,062 --> 01:59:13,302
They will not agree.
So? Will you dare to do this?

2261
01:59:13,342 --> 01:59:17,182
Haven't you thought about mom, dad, uncle
and aunt?

2262
01:59:17,262 --> 01:59:17,942
They will die.

2263
01:59:18,742 --> 01:59:21,302
What should we say to Ajay
who loved you since childhood?

2264
01:59:21,342 --> 01:59:22,902
How can you be so selfish?

2265
01:59:23,182 --> 01:59:26,142
Swetha! Let us go away from here.
Hey! Where will you go?

2266
01:59:26,182 --> 01:59:27,782
Brother…Stop.
How can you leave after seeing me?

2267
01:59:27,822 --> 01:59:29,022
I love her.
Brother…Stop it.

2268
01:59:29,142 --> 01:59:30,022
Will you take her away? Huh?

2269
01:59:30,062 --> 01:59:31,782
You should convince her family
if you really love her.

2270
01:59:31,862 --> 01:59:34,102
How you run away with her.
I love her. Try to understand.

2271
01:59:34,142 --> 01:59:35,342
Swetha.
Swetha! Stop.

2272
01:59:35,502 --> 01:59:36,262
Swetha! Stop.

2273
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:37,942
Swetha! What are you doing?
Swetha.

2274
01:59:38,462 --> 01:59:39,462
What are you doing?

2275
01:59:39,502 --> 01:59:41,382
How will uncle feel if he knows about it?

2276
01:59:41,462 --> 01:59:42,902
What happened?
What's the matter?

2277
01:59:44,182 --> 01:59:45,462
What happened that made you do so?

2278
01:59:47,422 --> 01:59:48,622
Tell me at least now, Swetha.

2279
01:59:49,742 --> 01:59:52,182
I am pregnant, brother.

2281
02:00:13,782 --> 02:00:14,182
Hey.

2282
02:00:14,382 --> 02:00:14,742
Get up.

2283
02:00:19,582 --> 02:00:20,742
Be happy always.

2284
02:00:32,862 --> 02:00:34,142
'I was the one who did a mistake.'

2285
02:00:34,502 --> 02:00:40,662
But, Tej bro put him at fault to hide
my mistake, uncle.

2286
02:00:41,742 --> 02:00:46,262
A lot has happened today. But,
he will not say that it is my mistake.

2287
02:00:48,182 --> 02:00:50,302
That is how my brother is.

2288
02:01:00,982 --> 02:01:02,782
Why didn't you tell me about it?

2289
02:01:03,102 --> 02:01:04,062
Not an issue, aunt.

2290
02:01:04,142 --> 02:01:04,902
What is all this?

2291
02:01:08,102 --> 02:01:08,702
Uncle.

2292
02:01:08,822 --> 02:01:09,542
What happened?

2293
02:01:11,662 --> 02:01:13,222
Listen. What happened to you?

2294
02:01:13,422 --> 02:01:14,422
Sorry, dear.

2295
02:01:14,582 --> 02:01:15,662
What for?

2296
02:01:15,662 --> 02:01:16,822
Forget it, uncle.

2297
02:01:23,462 --> 02:01:24,102
Dad.

2298
02:01:28,702 --> 02:01:31,462
Brother! Forgive me, brother.

2299
02:01:33,342 --> 02:01:35,262

Bye.

2353
02:05:43,902 --> 02:05:44,942
Come, dear.

2354
02:05:45,422 --> 02:05:46,942
We are waiting for you.

2355
02:05:48,662 --> 02:05:49,542
What happened, uncle?

2356
02:05:49,622 --> 02:05:53,062
Hey! You came here to find the guy
who saved your mother, right?

2357
02:05:53,302 --> 02:05:54,062
Yes, uncle.

2358
02:05:54,742 --> 02:05:55,742
How do you know?

2359
02:05:56,462 --> 02:05:57,662
I just came to know that.

2360
02:05:58,182 --> 02:06:00,142
Mr. Murthy! Nandini is here.

2361
02:06:02,702 --> 02:06:05,022
I heard that Mr. Murthy came early from UK.

2362
02:06:05,222 --> 02:06:06,702
So, I went and met him in Vizag.

2363
02:06:08,382 --> 02:06:12,382
Dear! I got to know that this is the house
of that boy.

2364
02:06:13,342 --> 02:06:16,102
Later, I got to know that you are here.

2365
02:06:17,542 --> 02:06:18,862
I know everything, dear.

2366
02:06:18,942 --> 02:06:21,822
The one who saved your mom and
went to the prison is none other than…

2367
02:06:21,862 --> 02:06:22,382
Tej!

2368
02:06:24,862 --> 02:06:26,662
What are you saying, sir?

2369
02:06:26,902 --> 02:06:27,662
Yes, dear.

2370
02:06:28,782 --> 02:06:30,542
My son saved your mom.

2371
02:06:43,822 --> 02:06:44,302
Tej.

2372
02:06:46,222 --> 02:06:47,782
My mom said about you…

2373
02:06:48,262 --> 02:06:50,022
Mr. Gangadhar told you everything, right?

2374
02:06:50,142 --> 02:06:52,582
Your mom thought about me before she died.

2375
02:06:53,382 --> 02:06:55,182
Your mom is very great, Nandini.

2376
02:06:56,022 --> 02:06:58,342
I hurt you a lot knowingly or unknowingly.

2377
02:06:58,702 --> 02:06:59,382
I am sorry.

2378
02:07:04,582 --> 02:07:06,662
Tej! Come with me.

2379
02:07:06,702 --> 02:07:07,702
What happened, uncle?

2380
02:07:07,742 --> 02:07:08,462
Just come.

2381
02:07:12,462 --> 02:07:13,062
Hey.

2382
02:07:13,742 --> 02:07:15,062
Tej!
Did Nandini come?

2383
02:07:15,182 --> 02:07:15,862
Oh!

2384
02:07:15,982 --> 02:07:17,102
Hey…Sssh…

2385
02:07:17,182 --> 02:07:18,582
Why did you bring him alone?

2386
02:07:18,622 --> 02:07:19,742
Why didn't you ask him?

2387
02:07:19,822 --> 02:07:22,182
Yeah. I should've asked.
Uncle! What is happening?

2388
02:07:22,582 --> 02:07:23,422
Nothing, dear.

2389
02:07:23,582 --> 02:07:24,702
Everyone told me.

2390
02:07:24,742 --> 02:07:26,382
That you are in love with that girl.

2391
02:07:27,062 --> 02:07:29,462
I will talk to Nandini. Okay?
No, uncle.

2392
02:07:32,462 --> 02:07:33,142
What happened?

2393
02:07:34,142 --> 02:07:35,262
Why do you refuse?

2394
02:07:36,782 --> 02:07:38,302
It is true that I love Nandu.

2395
02:07:39,182 --> 02:07:40,422
But, that is my bad luck.

2396
02:07:40,702 --> 02:07:44,102
She met with an accident before
knowing her feeling.

2397
02:07:44,262 --> 02:07:45,142
She forgot everything.

2398
02:07:47,302 --> 02:07:51,382
But, I still tried to gain her love.

2399
02:07:51,742 --> 02:07:53,662
In that process, I turned out to be a fraud.

2400
02:07:55,542 --> 02:07:58,982
It is not right to force her to love me.

2401
02:08:00,022 --> 02:08:02,062
No, uncle. Let it be.

2402
02:08:04,422 --> 02:08:05,342
Listen, Tej.

2403
02:08:05,622 --> 02:08:06,942
Everything is good.

2404
02:08:07,262 --> 02:08:09,022
Why are you talking like that?

2405
02:08:09,142 --> 02:08:09,902
Yeah.

2406
02:08:10,222 --> 02:08:12,142
Nandini will accept you if you ask her now.

2407
02:08:14,062 --> 02:08:15,142
Yeah! She might agree.

2408
02:08:15,542 --> 02:08:17,302
She might get ready to risk her life for me.

2409
02:08:17,622 --> 02:08:18,902
But, that won't be love.

2410
02:08:20,222 --> 02:08:22,062
It would be more like a favor, uncle.

2411
02:08:22,582 --> 02:08:23,382
Let it be.

2412
02:08:25,342 --> 02:08:26,382
It is not like that, dear.

2413
02:08:26,382 --> 02:08:28,262
You used to say this during my childhood.

2414
02:08:28,302 --> 02:08:31,822
We should expect them to be happy
when we help someone.

2415
02:08:32,022 --> 02:08:33,462
But, never expect a favor.

2416
02:08:34,662 --> 02:08:37,742
You might tell her about
my love and she might agree.

2417
02:08:37,822 --> 02:08:38,942
It would be selfishness.

2418
02:08:39,902 --> 02:08:41,622
Love should come out from heart.

2419
02:08:42,102 --> 02:08:43,902
It shouldn't be the reaction of
helping someone.

2420
02:08:45,462 --> 02:08:48,222
'I fell in love with you
before knowing this.'

2421
02:08:48,302 --> 02:08:50,102
Brother! What are you saying?

2422
02:08:50,462 --> 02:08:53,102
What if she fell in love before knowing this?

2423
02:08:53,262 --> 02:08:53,982
It is not like that.

2424
02:08:54,062 --> 02:08:56,262
She prayed when we came here.

2425
02:08:56,462 --> 02:08:57,862
That we should depart.

2426
02:08:58,182 --> 02:08:59,542
It is better to do that.

2427
02:09:02,982 --> 02:09:03,742
Please, brother.

2428
02:09:03,782 --> 02:09:05,142
Please give it a try…

2429
02:09:05,182 --> 02:09:08,062
Please. I will not accept
even if Nandu says so.

2430
02:09:24,142 --> 02:09:24,582
Tej.

2431
02:09:26,582 --> 02:09:27,142
Tej.

2432
02:09:30,862 --> 02:09:32,102
Good that everyone is here.

2433
02:09:33,942 --> 02:09:36,382
Tej! I have a flight this evening.

2434
02:09:36,742 --> 02:09:38,422
Dad would wait for me at the airport.

2435
02:09:39,342 --> 02:09:40,262
I will leave.

2436
02:09:41,742 --> 02:09:42,582
Greetings, aunty.

2437
02:09:43,182 --> 02:09:44,302
Wait for a minute, dear.

2438
02:09:44,862 --> 02:09:46,422
He will drop you to the airport.

2439
02:09:46,782 --> 02:09:47,342
Go.

2440
02:09:48,822 --> 02:09:50,062
You've got flight in the evening.

2441
02:09:50,102 --> 02:09:53,582
Wait for a while.
Have food and then you can leave.

2442
02:09:53,702 --> 02:09:54,022
Come.

2443
02:09:54,622 --> 02:09:55,102
Let's go, dear.

2444
02:09:55,142 --> 02:09:57,262
Tej! Think about it just once.

2445
02:09:57,382 --> 02:09:58,382
Listen to me.

2446
02:10:11,342 --> 02:10:13,182
Tej! Let's go.

2447
02:10:21,582 --> 02:10:22,262
Bye.

2448
02:11:29,142 --> 02:11:31,262
Bye.
Bye.

2449
02:12:01,782 --> 02:12:02,502
Come, dear.

2450
02:12:03,142 --> 02:12:04,262
Did your programme go well?

2451
02:12:04,902 --> 02:12:05,502
Hmm.

2452
02:12:08,222 --> 02:12:09,342
Take this, dad.

2453
02:12:11,102 --> 02:12:11,982
What is this, dear?

2454
02:12:12,942 --> 02:12:15,262
You came to India for this, right?

2455
02:12:17,422 --> 02:12:20,742
Tej who came with me is the
one who saved mom.

2456
02:12:21,422 --> 02:12:23,702
But, he denied taking the property.

2457
02:13:35,302 --> 02:13:38,302
<font color="#FFD700">(FLIGHT ANNOUNCEMENT)</font>

2458
02:13:47,542 --> 02:13:48,542
Hi, Nandini.

2459
02:13:50,022 --> 02:13:51,782
Did you propose Tej?

2460
02:13:55,462 --> 02:13:56,182
No, sir.

2461
02:13:56,782 --> 02:13:57,622
But, who are you?

2462
02:13:57,702 --> 02:13:58,742
What is this?

2463
02:13:58,822 --> 02:14:00,382
You came to my college to meet him.

2464
02:14:00,422 --> 02:14:01,222
Did you forget?

2465
02:14:02,142 --> 02:14:02,742
Yes, sir.

2466
02:14:02,782 --> 02:14:03,782
I forgot everything.

2467
02:14:04,862 --> 02:14:06,142
The reason for coming here…

2468
02:14:06,542 --> 02:14:07,942
Everything that happened after that…

2469
02:14:08,222 --> 02:14:09,382
I forgot everything.

2470
02:14:16,102 --> 02:14:17,142
Oh! Is it?

2471
02:14:17,422 --> 02:14:18,542
Don't worry, dear.

2472
02:14:18,782 --> 02:14:20,502
I will tell you what happened that day.

2473
02:14:21,142 --> 02:14:23,902
You came to propose
Tej while he was writing his exam.

2474
02:14:23,942 --> 02:14:27,062
You asked me to give a letter to Tej.

2475
02:14:27,102 --> 02:14:28,822
I thought that it was a chit and tore it.

2476
02:14:29,102 --> 02:14:30,622
You became sad and left.

2477
02:14:32,982 --> 02:14:33,702
Who are you?

2478
02:14:34,542 --> 02:14:36,022
Dad! Just one minute.

2479
02:14:36,102 --> 02:14:38,462
The final boarding announcement is made.
We have to go.

2480
02:14:41,462 --> 02:14:42,302
Sorry, sir.

2481
02:14:42,982 --> 02:14:44,142
My luck is bad.

2482
02:14:44,502 --> 02:14:46,382
Tej will not accept even if I say it now.

2483
02:14:48,222 --> 02:14:49,342
Thank you so much, sir.

2484
02:14:53,422 --> 02:14:54,582
Wait, dear.

2485
02:14:56,022 --> 02:14:57,622
You came back again that day.

2486
02:15:07,022 --> 02:15:09,022
Yes. You came back again that day.

2487
02:15:09,982 --> 02:15:10,502
Sir.

2488
02:15:11,622 --> 02:15:12,742
What is it now?

2489
02:15:13,302 --> 02:15:15,782
Sir! Will you give this pen to Tej?

2490
02:15:15,822 --> 02:15:17,622
But, he brought a pen.

2491
02:15:17,702 --> 02:15:19,222
This isn't a pen to write.

2492
02:15:19,302 --> 02:15:19,862
Then, what?

2493
02:15:19,942 --> 02:15:20,582
One minute.

2494
02:15:22,542 --> 02:15:24,342
Hey! Write your exam later.

2495
02:15:24,422 --> 02:15:25,502
Come out first.

2496
02:15:25,662 --> 02:15:26,862
I love you.

2497
02:15:26,942 --> 02:15:28,382
Love you.

2498
02:15:28,822 --> 02:15:29,782
Give this to Tej.

2499
02:15:29,822 --> 02:15:31,062
He will understand.

2500
02:15:32,662 --> 02:15:33,222
Tej.

2501
02:15:33,582 --> 02:15:34,262
Who is Tej?

2502
02:15:39,582 --> 02:15:40,142
Tej.

2503
02:15:41,782 --> 02:15:42,422
Tej!

2504
02:15:42,542 --> 02:15:43,382
Who is Tej?

2505
02:15:43,542 --> 02:15:44,062
Tej?

2506
02:15:45,102 --> 02:15:46,262
Tej wasn't in the class.

2507
02:15:46,422 --> 02:15:47,382
You left.

2508
02:15:49,622 --> 02:15:52,622
I tried to find either of you to
give this pen.

2509
02:15:52,822 --> 02:15:54,462
Take it. This is your pen.

2510
02:15:54,862 --> 02:15:56,182
Thank you, sir.

2511
02:15:59,542 --> 02:16:00,422
Nandini dear.

2512
02:16:00,782 --> 02:16:01,422
Sir.

2513
02:16:01,502 --> 02:16:02,142
Wait…

2514
02:16:12,182 --> 02:16:12,902
Tej!

2515
02:16:38,262 --> 02:16:39,102
This pen?

2516
02:16:40,861 --> 02:16:41,861
Professor gave it to me.

2517
02:16:42,822 --> 02:16:45,782
You were writing your exam and I came there.

2518
02:16:48,861 --> 02:16:49,621
Did you come?

2519
02:16:49,902 --> 02:16:50,342
Hmm.

2520
02:16:53,982 --> 02:16:54,542
Hey.

2521
02:16:54,781 --> 02:16:56,101
Write your exam later.

2522
02:16:56,422 --> 02:16:57,342
Come out first.

2523
02:16:58,302 --> 02:16:59,422
I love you.

2524
02:16:59,822 --> 02:17:00,622
Love you.

2525
02:17:00,781 --> 02:17:01,421
Love you.

2526
02:17:05,982 --> 02:17:08,262
I loved you back then, Tej.

2527
02:17:09,462 --> 02:17:12,342
I didn't have anything other
than this to say that to you.

2528
02:17:14,582 --> 02:17:15,662
I love you.

2529
02:17:16,861 --> 02:17:18,181
I love you, Tej.

2530
