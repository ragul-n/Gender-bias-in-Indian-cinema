1
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,050
Valmiki! Is your wife admitted here?

2
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:04,508
Yes... First floor, General ward.

3
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,508
Where is Mr. Ramachandra’s wife?

4
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:14,466
She’s on the second floor… Special ward.

5
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:25,675
It’s a baby boy.

6
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:27,883
That’s great news.

7
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:31,675
I don’t have change…
I can’t afford to tip you a note.

8
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,050
Thank god.

9
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:44,508
Sister, clean the baby
and put her to bed.

10
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,258
We must inform Mr. Ramachandra
about this.

11
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,008
It’s very big news for them, okay?

12
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,591
Okay, doctor.

13
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,341
Note down the exact time.

14
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:27,758
I don’t want the horoscope
to be messed up.

15
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:28,633
It’s 12...

16
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,591
Sir, I need the phone.

17
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,008
Can’t you see that I’m talking here?

18
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:33,175
It’s an emergency, sir.

19
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,091
Mr. Ramachandra’s baby boy…

20
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:36,925
So what?

21
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,633
He was stable when the doctor
saw him last.

22
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,133
But he’s not moving now.

23
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,258
Ma’am is under sedation.

24
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,966
I’ll call you back.

25
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,591
Doctor informed the family that
it’s a baby boy.

26
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:49,425
I’m really worried…

27
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:50,800
They are influential people.

28
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,258
I’m afraid they will pin this on me.

29
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:55,591
Fine.

30
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,050
I’m blessed with a boy…

31
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,508
Let’s switch Mr. Ramachandra’s son
with mine.

32
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,841
I working in their company.

33
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:21,966
It’s their generosity that
I lead a decent life.

34
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,550
This is the least I can do for them.

35
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,508
I’ll give them my baby boy.

36
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,925
How will you explain this to your wife?

37
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,466
Only my family will prosper
if he is with us.

38
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,758
But a whole community will prosper
If he is with them.

39
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,008
I will sacrifice my child.

40
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,758
By God’s grace, hopefully I’ll have
another kid in a year or so.

41
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,758
Sir, listen to me.

42
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:47,383
Don’t say a word… Just come with me.

43
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:48,508
Come on.

44
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:24,425
Pick him up.

45
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:25,841
Pick him up.

46
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:28,841
We are switching dead baby
with a baby.

47
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,133
What’s wrong?
Pick him up.

48
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:32,383
Make it fast.

49
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,675
Let’s get out, Come on.

50
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:04,300
Let’s go!

51
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,300
Sir…

52
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:17,133
He's alive.

53
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:18,258
Give him to me.

54
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:20,466
Sir!

55
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,758
- Give him to me!
- Sir, no!

56
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,216
- Sir! Sir!
- Shut up!

57
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,341
No, sir.

58
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:27,300
You did sacrifice your kid…

59
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,425
But now you are betraying them.

60
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:30,758
Betrayal?

61
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,133
Ramachandra and I joined this company
at the same time.

62
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,133
We’d go to the office together
on my scooter.

63
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:39,216
He got lucky and married ARK’s daughter
and drives car now.

64
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,383
What about me?

65
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,425
And I’m still driving the same old scooter.

66
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,633
He just got lucky.

67
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:44,966
This baby though...

68
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:48,091
He could’ve cried when we switched him
with my son.

69
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,133
He started crying when
we got downstairs. Why?

70
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:51,425
He is unlucky.

71
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,383
My son is destined to lead a superior life.

72
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:56,175
While his son leads an ordinary life.

73
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,883
It’s God’s play...
There’s nothing I can do about it.

74
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,591
- Go away!
- No, sir. Don’t do it.

75
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:03,758
This is not betrayal... It’s a sin.

76
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,550
You were plotting it this whole time.

77
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:07,841
- I can’t let you do this.
- Shut up!

78
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,841
- Don't separate baby from his mother.
- I said shut up!

79
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,258
I won’t let you do this.
Give the baby to me.

80
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,550
I said let go!
Don’t make a scene now.

81
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,591
It’s over!
Forget it and go away.

82
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:17,175
- Give the baby back to me.
- I said go away!

83
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,466
Hey, Valmiki!

84
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,508
It's a baby boy.

85
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:37,258
How about you?
Baby boy or baby girl?

86
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,216
- Baby boy!
- Congrats! Congrats!

87
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:42,175
What’s wrong?

88
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,300
Nothing. I got a leg cramp.

89
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,341
Actually, you got lucky, man.

90
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Baby.

91
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,675
‘Ala Vaikuntapuramlo’

92
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,133
What’s his name?

93
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:03,050
Raj! Raj Manohar!

94
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,133
Raj!

95
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,091
Raj Steels!

96
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,383
Raj Infra!

97
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,716
Amazing!

98
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,591
Did you like it?

99
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:15,133
It’s a royal name, sir.

100
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:17,050
The name a King deserves.

101
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,175
This is all good.

102
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,966
But have you thought of any names
for your son?

103
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:22,050
Yes.

104
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:23,050
Tell me.

105
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,383
Is that a name?

106
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:29,383
Is this ‘The’ name?

107
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:30,175
Yeah!

108
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:31,550
What kind of name is this?

109
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:33,175
I’ve performed several
naming-ceremonies till date.

110
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:35,341
But I have never and will never approve of
such a name.

111
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,883
I’ll be putting my image at stakes
with this name.

112
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:39,300
- Priest...
- What? What? What?

113
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,633
How can you call your son ‘Bantu’
(Servant)? It’s disgusting!

114
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:42,966
Right!

115
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:46,258
Why? Lord Hanuman is called ‘Rama Bantu’.

116
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:47,716
He’s still worshipped.

117
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:49,925
Lord Hanuman and Lord Rama
are an exception.

118
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,883
Whose servant is your son going to be?

119
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,216
I’m asking you.

120
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:57,175
What is this?

121
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,300
- You scored 9 in Math?
- Hmm.

122
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:03,633
It’s okay if your teacher didn’t
give you a higher score. We’ll add it.

123
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:06,550
7...

124
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,716
- What are you doing, Valmiki?
- Ma’am...

125
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:13,716
Raj’s progress report.

126
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,300
Oh. His score in Math?

127
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:16,675
Umm... 97.

128
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,091
Raj!

129
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:20,591
Well done!

130
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,758
Dear! He scored 98 in Math.

131
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,466
Why did you leave those 2 marks?

132
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:31,716
You should’ve scored a 100.

133
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,508
How can you say that, dear?
He got such a good score.

134
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,550
His score won’t change anything.

135
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,716
Few people are born that way.
Very bad!

136
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:47,633
After 20 years

137
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:49,550
Hey, stop it!

138
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:54,508
Hold it properly.

139
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:05,925
Thank god! he’s here and
my son is in the palace.

140
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:12,091
He’s happy even while sleeping.

141
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:17,341
Even though you lost everything,
How do you manage to stay happy?

142
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:19,258
Hey!

143
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:22,675
Grandma has sent  pickles.
you need to go get it.

144
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,883
Go to the bus stand.

145
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,383
Do I have an option?

146
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,425
Here you go, dear
Coconut and camphor.

147
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:42,883
Where’s the pumpkin?
- We don’t have it.

148
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,758
Did you add it to the lentils broth?
- I did, sir.

149
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,216
He is coming home from America
after 2 years.

150
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:50,883
We need pumpkin to ward off evil.

151
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:51,883
Damn it!

152
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,216
He isn’t coming home after
a great achievement.

153
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,091
He dropped out in the
final semester of MBA.

154
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:58,425
Please calm down, sir.

155
00:12:58,841 --> 00:12:59,966
Third semester!

156
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,425
- Only three?
- Hmm.

157
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,175
- Hello.
- Hey.

158
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:06,633
Are you at the bus stand?

159
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,383
Yes, you told me to collect pickles.

160
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,300
Dump them, buy a pumpkin
and come to Mr. ARK’s residence.

161
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,550
Pumpkin?!

162
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:13,591
Yes! Pumpkin!

163
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,508
How will I get pumpkin here?

164
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:17,591
- Pumpkin?
- Don’t be late. It’s urgent.

165
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,050
Autorickshaw!

166
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:27,383
Wait here.

167
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:42,133
Hey! Hey! Where are you rushing?
- Relax!

168
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,258
You can’t carry it.

169
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:46,675
I’m carrying your burden. This is nothing.

170
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:47,591
Give it to me.

171
00:13:48,383 --> 00:13:49,591
I’ve been noticing since I was a kid.

172
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:52,300
You never let me cross the gate,
What’s your problem?

173
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,508
It’s Vaikunthapuram (Divine Abode), son.

174
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,841
No entry for losers like you.

175
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,008
Few lives don’t get any better.
Very bad!

176
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:00,300
Go back home.

177
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,050
Raj is here! Raj is here!

178
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,633
He has affection towards
everyone except me.

179
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:09,716
Sir, should I drop the luggage inside?

180
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:14,258
Why would I hire an auto,
If I had such a big house.

181
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:16,341
Let's go...

182
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,883
Let’s drive through the bumpy lanes
of Ameerpet.

183
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:20,841
That’s our range.

184
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:28,383
Have you been drinking a lot in America?

185
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,591
You are shining.

186
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:30,925
Well, he’s back…

187
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,925
You both can drink together now.

188
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,300
What did you get me?

189
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:39,091
He’s already feeling low, dad.

190
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:40,966
Don’t hurt him more. Please!

191
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,550
But we are hurt not him.

192
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:58,591
Dad, I have to do some shopping…

193
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:00,508
Take me with you while going to office…

194
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,508
I’m busy… He will take you.

195
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:09,466
What is she saying?

196
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,758
She says he’s got an interview.

197
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:12,966
It’s 8’o clock now.

198
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,425
His interview is at 10.

199
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:19,008
Ask him to take her,
buy medicines for his mom...

200
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:20,841
And then attend the interview.

201
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,383
Plenty of time on his hands.

202
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,883
Ugh! Not again.
What is she saying now?

203
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:31,716
How can he manage
in such short span of time?

204
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,966
Like I manage this family with my salary.

205
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,425
Ask him to do the same.

206
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,175
- Hey!
- Huh?

207
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:39,008
We are from a middle class family.

208
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:41,258
We have tons of things to worry about.

209
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,008
We have to move on.
- Okay.

210
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,050
Brother!

211
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,050
Brother.

212
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:07,050
Buy medicines for mom.
I’m running late for my interview.

213
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,758
- They snatched my scarf?
- I know, right?

214
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:12,258
If girls like the color,
they will snatch it

215
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,216
What will men do with a scarf?

216
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:15,466
They must be out of their minds.

217
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,341
Buy chocolates with the change.

218
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:21,341
Usually, brothers get very angry and fight
When men misbehave with their sisters.

219
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:22,758
Hey... Relax!

220
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,508
You have way too many expectations
from me, sweetheart.

221
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:28,841
I’m late for my interview.

222
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:31,050
Would you react like this
if it were your girlfriend?

223
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:34,716
No.

224
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,008
Get lost!

225
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:40,758
Damn!! That was provoking.

226
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:42,758
I feel like doing something now.

227
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:47,966
Brother, did you see a gang pass by
with a scarf in their hands?

228
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,716
The guys on the red bike?

229
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,633
How does that matter?

230
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:53,133
Where did they go?

231
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,633
Brother...

232
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,675
That scarf... Belongs to my sister.

233
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:09,800
Your sister looks smoking hot, man.

234
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,133
Thank you.

235
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:13,591
Can I get the scarf back?

236
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,841
Get your sister here in exchange
for the scarf.

237
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,550
Scarf...

238
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,341
Give me the scarf!

239
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,466
When he said my sister looks hot,
I didn’t feel bad.

240
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:16,466
She’s a beautiful girl.

241
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,883
I was happy that she’d save
some money on the dowry.

242
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:21,091
That’s how we middle class people think.

243
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,050
But that guy intervened
like some 80s villain...

244
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:27,133
And said sister in exchange for the scarf.
How could he say that?

245
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,133
No, listen...

246
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:30,175
He ripped my heart apart.

247
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:43,008
Looking up and to the sides when
I’m sad is my mannerism.

248
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,758
But you don’t have the basic sense
of thinking twice before hitting someone.

249
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,966
Chinni.
- Sorry brother… I got angry.

250
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,883
That’s fine. I got you scarf back.

251
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:00,675
- They gave it back?
- Yes, they cleaned it too.

252
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
That move?

253
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,425
Stylish, right?

254
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,925
- I like it too.
- How?

255
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:15,550
I don’t know… It just worked out.

256
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:26,453
Why do you want to join
our  tourism company?

257
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:30,370
With the help of your company
I can visit countries.

258
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:31,620
He's energetic.

259
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,995
Give me your file.

260
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:36,661
- I’m Ravinder Reddy.
- Hello, sir.

261
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:38,661
- I deal with sales in this company.
- Okay.

262
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:40,536
But the HR met with a small accident.

263
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:41,786
He’ll be joining us later.

264
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:43,245
So let’s proceed.
- Sure.

265
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:44,370
All the best.

266
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,203
Hey! I like your sense of humor, man.
- Thank you, sir.

267
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:49,995
Bantu. Interesting name!
Okay, lets go down.

268
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:51,203
Dream.

269
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,620
People usually about visit
Bangkok or buy Bentley car.

270
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,828
But yours reads, ‘I want to buy a bike’.
‘First Hand’ in brackets.

271
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:58,661
- Have you got time to spare, sir?
- Lots of it.

272
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:00,578
- Dear...
- Hmm?

273
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,245
His college is starting tomorrow.
Did you bring him any new clothes?

274
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:04,661
Of course, I did.

275
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:08,911
I said Mr. Ramachandra’s son that
Bantu was starting college.

276
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,745
He gave me all his old clothes right away.

277
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,911
That’s not it... I was looking
at the perfume in his hand.

278
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,399
Was he gracious enough to give
his used perfume as well?

279
00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:19,555
Kidding me, huh?

280
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:21,503
Do you want it or not?

281
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,286
Do you have something to say?

282
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:32,411
I was forced to.

283
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:38,370
You’re always so blunt and honest, huh?

284
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:40,786
I get headache whenever I lie.

285
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:43,203
And when I started speaking the truth…
The other person started having a headache.

286
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:44,495
I feel so relaxed now, sir.

287
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:47,411
So you must’ve started telling the truth
about the little things first.

288
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:49,703
Not at all, sir.
I had gone straight for the big fish.

289
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:57,328
Hey! I guess it’s the loan shark.
Tell him I’m not home.

290
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:01,286
Hey... Is your father home?

291
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:02,578
Father...

292
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:04,245
He asked me to tell you
he isn’t home.

293
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,078
So shameless!

294
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,245
How could you make
your kid lie for you?

295
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,495
You’ve already lost one of your legs.

296
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:17,078
Betray a good man like and me
you’ll lose the other one as well.

297
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:20,578
Whatever.

298
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:22,245
That leg is going to hurt badly.

299
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:27,995
What did you just tell him?

300
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,328
Better, you should’ve led him to me
directly.

301
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:33,036
You’re just supposed to say
‘Dad’s not home’. That’s it!

302
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:36,161
Hey, can I see your dad?

303
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:37,995
He’s not home...

304
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:41,703
Why do we care if he’s behind the wall
or under the table?

305
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,661
He’s not home and that’s final.

306
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,078
Your wife is not home, right?

307
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:55,078
Shameless fellow.

308
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,286
Hey!

309
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:03,161
We are middle class family.

310
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:06,786
How will you deal with life
if you can’t say few lies?

311
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:10,703
Hey, you’re always busy cooking.
Get some sense into him.

312
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,933
Besides, you’re not Ramachandra’s son.

313
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:15,536
You can’t afford to speak the truth always.
Moreover, aren’t you afraid?

314
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,745
If I tell the truth,
I’ll be afraid only for that moment.

315
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:19,786
But if I lie, I’ll be afraid all the time.

316
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:22,036
Wow!

317
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,620
That was a great punch! You rocked!

318
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,911
A mother is in pain only
when she’s giving birth.

319
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:30,453
But a father’s in pain throughout
the kid’s life.

320
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,911
Hey! Why are you not clapping?

321
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:35,703
He has fans and they clapped for him.

322
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:36,828
You have none and
so you get nothing.

323
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,036
Sit down and eat.

324
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,828
- You got a seat in MBA.
- It was a prestigious college, sir.

325
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:42,180
Why did you give it up?

326
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:44,620
Hey! The job is done.

327
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,451
I sorted everything out.

328
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,755
Sort?

329
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:51,328
How could you cancel his scholarship
to get her a seat?

330
00:23:51,578 --> 00:23:53,120
He’s a man.

331
00:23:53,578 --> 00:23:55,078
He’ll figure something out.

332
00:23:57,786 --> 00:23:59,036
What are you looking at, huh?

333
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:02,453
Son...

334
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:03,911
Shall I tell you something?

335
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:05,578
You might have scored 90+ runs
a zillion times.

336
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:08,453
But your number of centuries
still stands at zero.

337
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:10,745
That explains your life to the dot.

338
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:12,786
You almost get what you want
but never quite have it.

339
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,953
Like I told you,
few lives don’t get any better.

340
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:17,661
Very bad!

341
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:24,911
This tragedy calls for more
than a century, Bantu.

342
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,536
- Too heavy, sir?
- Yeah!

343
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:30,328
Shall we try something musical?
Something light-hearted.

344
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:31,786
Definitely.

345
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,828
Hey! Give the table lamp and
desk to your sister, She has to study.

346
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:42,911
My son is always a King.

347
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:05,995
“I can’t begin to tell you my story.
My pain has no ending”

348
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,536
“Why are these dads torturing us?”

349
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:11,036
“They don’t listen to us or understand us”

350
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,786
“Thinking of dad gives me chills all over”

351
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:16,286
“I ask for 100 bucks and he reminds me
we’re not rich”

352
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:21,245
“I cry to myself thinking
he’s out of his mind"

353
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:23,953
“It’s the same scene in every household.
What do you say, bro?”

354
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,553
“Oh my god, daddy!”

355
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:30,290
“Just don’t be my baddie”

356
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:32,332
“Oh my god, daddy!”

357
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,790
“Just don’t be my baddie”

358
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:37,248
“Oh my god, daddy!”

359
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:39,790
“Just don’t be my baddie”

360
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,498
“Don’t be so hard on me”

361
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,998
“That will make me sad”

362
00:25:56,707 --> 00:26:01,165
“My name is Bantu and I hate my name”

363
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:06,165
“I fight with my cunning dad day and night”

364
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:11,290
“My mother’s husband...”

365
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:16,623
“Turned out to be my dad”

366
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:21,290
“You can’t lock rain in a bottle”

367
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,790
“You can’t capture joy in a snap”

368
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,998
“There are no shortcuts to freedom”

369
00:26:26,082 --> 00:26:28,665
“You can deny me or join hands with me”

370
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,207
“You can’t fit the woods in your backyard”

371
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,748
“You can’t make a pigeon your paperweight”

372
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:36,207
“You can’t start bonfire using volcano”

373
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,790
“I’m a blank cheque that’s not cashed”

374
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:41,790
“He ain't always right”

375
00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:43,873
“Spy daddy!”

376
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:46,832
“He ain't always right”

377
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,873
“Spy daddy!”

378
00:26:49,498 --> 00:26:51,123
“Spy daddy!”

379
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:53,248
“Spy daddy!”

380
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:55,998
“Spy daddy!”

381
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:58,040
“Spy daddy!”

382
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:13,707
“Being the son of Valmiki means
being the epitome of problems”

383
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:18,790
“Only Thanos can make people
in this house smile with a snap”

384
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,998
“My mother’s husband...”

385
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:29,040
“He’s one big dummy”

386
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:32,248
“Oh my god, daddy!”

387
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,748
“Just don’t be my baddie”

388
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:37,290
“Oh my god, daddy!”

389
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,748
“Just don’t be my baddie”

390
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:42,290
“Oh my god, daddy!”

391
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:44,957
“Just don’t be my baddie”

392
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,415
“Don’t be so hard on me”

393
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,873
“That will make me so sad”

394
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:12,082
He wants a new bike.

395
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:14,623
He can use my scooter.

396
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:21,790
That’s enough, son.

397
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:25,415
He gets emotional for small things…

398
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,040
Enough… let me go.

399
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,457
No, you are safe here.

400
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:32,465
I might hit you if you are far from me.

401
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:39,665
Bantu, after listening to your story,
I feel like killing your dad.

402
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:41,957
But it’s a huge risk.

403
00:28:42,248 --> 00:28:44,248
It also makes me want to adopt you
and send you abroad.

404
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,332
But it’s a costly affair.

405
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:47,332
Because I can’t do either of it…

406
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,457
Let me offer you this job.

407
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:54,123
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on, dear. Sign here.

408
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:56,207
This should end all your miseries.

409
00:28:56,332 --> 00:28:56,832
Sir...

410
00:28:56,998 --> 00:28:58,082
Sekhar is here.

411
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,373
Great timing!

412
00:28:59,582 --> 00:29:02,165
He’s our HR. Meet him and
make a good first impression.

413
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,623
I’ll impress him, sir.

414
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:05,248
Sir...

415
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:06,873
Hey!

416
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:08,332
What happened?

417
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,873
I was happy you got the job.
but I’m shocked you hit the HR.

418
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:17,998
What to do, sir?

419
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:22,082
This is the time to put your character,
integrity and individuality aside...

420
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,373
and say sorry.

421
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,040
Mr. Reddy...

422
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:26,790
Sir...

423
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,665
Hey! What are you doing here?
Get out!

424
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,665
- Hey! Get out!
- I’m begging you.

425
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,832
Please sir... I’m begging you.

426
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:35,373
I really need this job sir…
Please sir, please sir...

427
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,957
I’ll give you the job... I feel like
I’m going to puke. Stop it right now.

428
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,665
You will stand by your word, right?

429
00:29:39,873 --> 00:29:41,332
Yes, let go of me!

430
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:44,665
Thank you sir…

431
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:47,900
Sign here… Right here...

432
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,225
Right here, sir... That's it!

433
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:53,831
Hey, he signed it! But how?

434
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:55,612
I touched his feet like you said.

435
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,586
- What did he do?
- He signed my papers.

436
00:29:57,748 --> 00:29:59,290
I will catch him red handed.

437
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:01,207
You go downstairs. I’ll come join you.
- See you, sir.

438
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:06,373
Did he hit you hard?

439
00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:08,498
He hit me with a scarf but
it was...

440
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,373
I won’t say the word.
But he broke my heart, Reddy.

441
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:12,207
No matter what you say,
I believe he has no ego.

442
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:14,373
That is why he touched your feet.
- What about me?

443
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:15,290
You have no common sense.

444
00:30:15,373 --> 00:30:16,582
That is why you snatched
his sister’s scarf.

445
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:17,957
I didn’t snatch it, Reddy.
It got stuck on my hand.

446
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,248
Good morning, sir!

447
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,040
I didn’t mean to do it.
It was an accident.

448
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:22,082
You could’ve returned the scarf.

449
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:24,498
- I didn’t want to create a scene.
- Well, you already did.

450
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,017
- Why is the production on hold?
- No stock, sir.

451
00:30:33,814 --> 00:30:34,748
Then order it.

452
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:37,082
Distribution has been halted because
we didn’t pay the bills, sir.

453
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:39,149
Call the bank and clear the due.

454
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:41,665
The OD is already too high.

455
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:49,290
- Oh. I’ll speak to them.
- Okay, sir.

456
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,415
Up!?

457
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,040
Morning.

458
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,373
- I said morning.
- Good morning.

459
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,207
- Which floor?
- Where are you going?

460
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,082
- Floor 9.
- Me too.

461
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,790
Pack your bags.

462
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,582
Yeah. Yeah.

463
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:17,665
I’ve never seen you around.

464
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:18,957
I joined yesterday.

465
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:21,415
- Yesterday?
- Hmm. Yesterday.

466
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:24,707
Have you met your boss?

467
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:26,082
He didn’t come to office yesterday.

468
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:27,373
All the best.

469
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:28,957
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

470
00:32:34,873 --> 00:32:36,123
This looks good too.

471
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,790
I saw a girl in the elevator earlier.

472
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:43,415
She blew my mind.

473
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,040
Is she the receptionist, Mr. Reddy?

474
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:46,873
I’d be with her right now
if she was so beautiful.

475
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:48,832
Go and greet our boss first.

476
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:50,207
We can relax for the day.

477
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:52,123
Relax and chill!
I’ll impress her and be right back.

478
00:32:52,248 --> 00:32:53,165
Definitely.

479
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,540
Good morning, sir

480
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:00,790
Now what did you do?

481
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:04,582
Hey! I thought you were just
in the elevator with ma’am.

482
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:05,790
But you were trying to get on her.

483
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:07,248
- Sir!
- I won’t say the word.

484
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:08,540
You were trying to flirt with her, huh?

485
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:10,998
What do we do, Mr. Reddy?

486
00:33:12,832 --> 00:33:14,623
Bantu... Bantu... Bantu...

487
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:16,207
You had a problem yesterday as well.

488
00:33:16,332 --> 00:33:18,373
I gave you a solution and it worked out.

489
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:19,915
You want me to touch her feet?

490
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,498
Any other alternatives?

491
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:22,790
Best option, sir.

492
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,082
So get going, my man!

493
00:33:24,248 --> 00:33:25,790
- Okay, sir.
- Hey, Reddy.

494
00:33:25,957 --> 00:33:28,498
He doesn’t just hold legs… He twists them
according to his convenience.

495
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
Bantu.

496
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,332
Cute!

497
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:34,290
Come in.

498
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:36,998
You think the name Bantu is cute?
It’s disgusting, ma’am.

499
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,165
In the elevator earlier...

500
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:44,540
Hello...

501
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:45,915
Look up.

502
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:47,123
My eyes are up here.

503
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:48,248
It’s hard for me, ma’am.

504
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,373
You’re working under me.

505
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,457
And I’m really happy about it, ma’am.

506
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:54,582
I’m your boss!

507
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,623
- Only the cabin has changed.
- I still have to touch people’s feet.

508
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:57,457
Uh-huh?

509
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:58,915
Telling the truth is my first
nature, ma’am.

510
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:01,415
Sadism is my mannerism, Bantu.

511
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:05,207
What?

512
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:21,957
People come here for holiday?

513
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:25,373
Maybe they can eat without cooking.

514
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:29,623
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too, baby.

515
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:31,248
I love you to death.

516
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:33,373
I love you more.

517
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,457
Hello...

518
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:36,873
Hey.

519
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,998
Why don't you change the topic?
I'm bored.

520
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,832
What? Why are you guys just leaving?

521
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:47,082
That’s the only thing on your mind, huh?

522
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:49,540
- Hello.
- Ma’am...

523
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:51,415
- Who’s this?
- It’s me, ma’am.

524
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:52,540
Who are you?

525
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,915
You got upset with me for staring
at your legs in the lift...

526
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:56,707
And so you sent me to Kutch.
It’s me. Bantu

527
00:34:57,332 --> 00:34:59,165
I haven’t seen a fellow human being
in 3 days.

528
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,540
And this couple is lost in love.

529
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:02,998
Oh my god!

530
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:05,665
This guy is pulling out the camping tents.

531
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:10,123
The temperature here is blazing, ma’am.
Please do something.

532
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:11,582
Something, huh?

533
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,582
Okay, I’ll do it.

534
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:17,832
Wow! What a beautiful place.
Nice pictures.

535
00:35:17,957 --> 00:35:19,165
This is nice.

536
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:21,665
I’ll stab you!

537
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,748
Stop crushing her.

538
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,665
See that? Let's go there.

539
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:30,623
Ma’am! Ma’am! Ma’am! Stop!

540
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,165
It’s very steep… You will fall down.

541
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:34,373
I’ll setup a rope and you can grab it
and go down.

542
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:35,332
Okay.

543
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:38,498
Don’t grab him. Grab the rope.

544
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:39,748
Okay, let’s go.

545
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:42,040
Wow! He is dancing so nice.

546
00:35:42,165 --> 00:35:43,582
Yes. It’s recorded.

547
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:45,373
- Wow! He is a good dancer.
- Yeah… Really nice.

548
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,207
- His dance moves are so nice. Wow!
- Very nice.

549
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:50,373
Hey! Don’t stop! Don’t stop!

550
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:53,207
Keep dancing that is such a nice move.

551
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:55,165
Ma’am...

552
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:56,332
Who is it?

553
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,415
It’s me, ma’am.

554
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,498
These people think I am dancing
but I am actually shivering…

555
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,498
They uploading the
videos on internet ma’am.

556
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:04,832
Just give me a corner seat in our office.

557
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,498
I’ll be at your feet.

558
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,873
I don't understand your fantasy with legs.

559
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:12,290
I didn’t mean it like that, ma’am.

560
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:14,248
I’m begging you. Please!

561
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:22,457
Sulochana...

562
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:25,498
Sulochana...

563
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:33,332
Are you sleeping?

564
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,623
Good... Sleep.

565
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:41,665
I bought you 24 apples per year,
2 per month.

566
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:44,248
So that makes 600 apples
in the last 25 years.

567
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:46,873
Pointless.

568
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,457
You are not conscious... You don’t eat.

569
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,248
I have diabetes... I can’t eat.

570
00:36:53,415 --> 00:36:56,123
On top of that, this leg keeps
bothering me.

571
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,915
When we fought for the baby
in the hospital that day...

572
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:02,915
I had a leg cramp, remember?

573
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:07,290
It just got worse with time and now
I’m limping.

574
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:11,915
You actually got lucky...
You are in coma for so long.

575
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:15,373
Because it happened on the day
my son was born...

576
00:37:16,165 --> 00:37:18,957
Mr. Ramachandra is continuing
your treatment against all odds.

577
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:22,332
So don’t feel guilty about it.

578
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,082
How long will you...?

579
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:28,540
- You speak Telugu?
- What?

580
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,165
Malayalam, huh?

581
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,957
How long will you cling on to this body?

582
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:33,957
Just let go.

583
00:37:34,498 --> 00:37:37,873
Take my advice and die in peace.

584
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:01,332
Doctor.

585
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,040
Doctor...

586
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,040
Did you check her Blood pressure?

587
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,873
Where is the nurse?
I want her reports.

588
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,582
Fast! Put oxygen mask on.

589
00:38:17,873 --> 00:38:19,082
Is she going to live?

590
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,790
Probably for 2 years if she’s in coma.

591
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,040
She has 2 more months.

592
00:38:25,082 --> 00:38:26,332
- Can she see?
- It’s complicated.

593
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:27,498
- Can she hear us?
- I’m not sure.

594
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:29,748
- Can she talk?
- Impossible!

595
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:30,873
Thank you.

596
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:35,040
You act cranky under the sun.

597
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:36,665
And you shiver in the snow.

598
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:41,123
You call me off the hook and say ‘Ma’am...’

599
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:43,290
You’re good for nothing.

600
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,957
Few lives don’t get any better, do they?

601
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:53,790
What?

602
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,457
Don’t belittle my life, ma’am.

603
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:58,665
I’ve heard enough from my dad.

604
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:00,623
I would get really angry
when he says it.

605
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:02,873
But now that you’re also saying it...

606
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:05,373
I’m afraid it might be true.

607
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:08,248
Over all these years,

608
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:11,332
I’ve never had a single phenomenal
day in my life.

609
00:39:12,457 --> 00:39:16,957
Is bad luck riding my dad,
me or my life?

610
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:19,207
I don't know.

611
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,290
Ma'am, this is a request.

612
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:28,457
Please wear pants and longer skirts.

613
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,790
I can’t look away.

614
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,665
So beautiful, ma’am.

615
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:34,290
Get up.

616
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:43,457
When there’s weight on your head,
you can’t look down.

617
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:46,290
- Ma’am?
- You can observe it, Bantu.

618
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:47,498
True.

619
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:50,290
More the weight, further you look up.

620
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:53,248
More the hard work,
further your succeed

621
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:54,582
Go.

622
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:56,748
Work on the Paris tour.

623
00:39:57,582 --> 00:39:58,748
Thank you, ma’am.

624
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:01,998
Book the return flight for the 5th.
- Okay. Okay.

625
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:03,623
Ma’am is...

626
00:40:05,373 --> 00:40:06,415
Ma’am!

627
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,415
Look.

628
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:11,123
Ma’am, sir...

629
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:13,998
She’s ma’am!

630
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:15,707
We know she’s our ma’am.
What next?

631
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,082
Actually, ma’am...

632
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:20,290
Bantu!

633
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:22,332
Sekhar sir, we have to handle few things
with love.

634
00:40:22,457 --> 00:40:23,248
Then do it.

635
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:24,957
- Dear...
- Yes, dear.

636
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:26,582
For the first time...

637
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:30,165
I saw madam’s eyes instead of her legs.

638
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,540
Ma’am is...

639
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:34,040
- Bantu!
- Ma'am.

640
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:36,248
Ma’am, huh?

641
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:38,040
Ma’am, my foot!

642
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:40,748
Sekhar sir, handle with love.

643
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,123
He’s already in love with her.

644
00:40:56,123 --> 00:41:00,415
“My eyes are hooked on to your legs”

645
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:04,748
“Don’t step on my gaze, show some mercy”

646
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,498
“My eyes are hooked on to your legs”

647
00:41:26,748 --> 00:41:30,915
“Don’t step on my gaze, show some mercy”

648
00:41:31,082 --> 00:41:35,290
“My dreams will guard your eyes like kohl”

649
00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:39,540
“You set me on fire when you rub
your rosy cheeks”

650
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:43,957
“Your tresses fly as my breath whistles
in the air”

651
00:41:44,123 --> 00:41:48,457
“Don’t get all cranky and push me away”

652
00:41:57,498 --> 00:42:01,623
“Sweetheart! I can’t help but fall for you”

653
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,915
“You know how the heart sways
to the youth’s beat”

654
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:10,332
“Sweetheart! I can’t help but fall for you”

655
00:42:10,623 --> 00:42:14,457
“You know how the heart sways
to the youth’s beat”

656
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:18,832
“My eyes are hooked on to your legs”

657
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:23,207
“Don’t step on my gaze, show some mercy”

658
00:42:57,873 --> 00:43:01,873
“You’re like the cool breeze spilling
fragrances of jasmine”

659
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:06,540
“You’re like the land
shimmering with moonlight”

660
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:10,790
“You’re like a peacock dancing
in a garden of flowers”

661
00:43:11,415 --> 00:43:15,415
“I can’t begin to describe your elegance
in words”

662
00:43:15,748 --> 00:43:20,165
“I caress you like the shadow
that chases you”

663
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:24,123
“Yet, you don’t react the slightest, girl”

664
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:28,873
“I realize you’re not the girl
who falls for trickery”

665
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,915
“Pay heed to this sweet plea
that makes my heart pound”

666
00:43:33,623 --> 00:43:37,623
“Sweetheart! I can’t help
but fall for you”

667
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:41,832
“You know how the heart sways
to the youth’s beat”

668
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:46,332
“Sweetheart! I can’t help but fall for you”

669
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:50,707
“You know how the heart sways
to the youth’s beat”

670
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:12,332
“My eyes are hooked on to your legs”

671
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:16,582
“Don’t step on my gaze, show some mercy”

672
00:44:16,873 --> 00:44:21,082
“My dreams will guard your eyes like kohl”

673
00:44:21,248 --> 00:44:25,623
“You set me on fire when you rub
your rosy cheeks”

674
00:44:31,029 --> 00:44:33,029
There is a man Appal Naidu

675
00:44:49,112 --> 00:44:51,779
It might be taxes or fee

676
00:44:52,154 --> 00:44:53,945
You must ask with respect.

677
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:03,154
You are not meeting him.

678
00:45:03,945 --> 00:45:05,695
You will meet his son.

679
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,779
Paidithalli

680
00:45:10,987 --> 00:45:12,404
ARK Infra.

681
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:14,737
They are planning to expand their company.

682
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:18,987
Ramachandran... The CEO of this company
is getting old.

683
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:21,237
His son Raj manohar...

684
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:23,237
Is very slow.

685
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:27,362
They need money and
I want a part of his company.

686
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:36,404
His son wants our company...
So, his father is sending him to deal...

687
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:39,987
To stop him, your father is sending you.

688
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,195
- Sir.
- No.

689
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:51,070
See...

690
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:54,654
It's easy to say 'No' to a waiter...

691
00:45:55,195 --> 00:45:57,987
But its difficult to reject
an influenced person.

692
00:45:58,487 --> 00:46:01,362
So, when you reject a influential person,

693
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,029
You will earn respect.

694
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,445
Son, it's okay even if you don't get power.

695
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:09,529
Be honest. That's enough.

696
00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:10,945
This is the truth.

697
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:20,862
Bye.

698
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:34,112
Hello... I am almost there ma'am...

699
00:46:45,654 --> 00:46:48,112
Don't worry, your father is in
the hotel right behind us

700
00:46:48,612 --> 00:46:49,904
Hotel behind us?

701
00:46:53,987 --> 00:46:55,029
Thank you.

702
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:04,445
Your load is exported to Korea from
our port every month.

703
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:06,279
That port is not your
father's establishment.

704
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,987
Tell him it belongs to the Government.

705
00:47:10,445 --> 00:47:14,029
But if we shut the gates,
your company will be in dire loss.

706
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:17,904
There are many ports in this country.
Tell him, Raj.

707
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:19,529
We will invest in your company.

708
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:21,945
Welcome us with open arms.

709
00:47:22,904 --> 00:47:24,154
We will be a part of your company.

710
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:25,820
Impossible!

711
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:27,612
Tell him, Raj.

712
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,820
Sudarshanam. My financier.

713
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:42,320
The one in the Grey coat?

714
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,862
- Bantu!! Respect!
- Ma’am.

715
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:49,070
We can cut down on diesel cost
if 4 people take the same car.

716
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:52,779
Similarly, you can cut down on holiday
expenses if 4 families travel together.

717
00:47:52,862 --> 00:47:53,945
It was her concept.

718
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:55,237
It's a great idea.

719
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,904
I believed the same and invested 5 crores.

720
00:47:57,154 --> 00:47:58,320
You’ve got a big heart.

721
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:00,154
She had a turnover of 50 crores
in just 2 years.

722
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,445
She’s got a big brain.

723
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,904
I’m offering 100 crores…

724
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:04,404
I want the company.

725
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:05,779
That’s a huge amount.

726
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:08,570
Sir!

727
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,112
What's your answer?

728
00:48:12,112 --> 00:48:13,279
Say no!

729
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,862
Why don't you talk?

730
00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:16,070
Say yes!

731
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:18,945
Say yes, dear.

732
00:48:19,154 --> 00:48:20,654
Say no.

733
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,279
Just say no!

734
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,445
Paidithalli...

735
00:48:28,987 --> 00:48:33,487
This isn’t a temple where
everyone is welcome.

736
00:48:34,987 --> 00:48:37,945
Besides, its loan when we ask for money.

737
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,570
When we don’t accept the offer.
It's rejection.

738
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:41,695
It’s a no!

739
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:44,362
Get out of my office!

740
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:54,154
Ma’am will not sell her company...

741
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:56,237
You speak.

742
00:48:56,487 --> 00:48:57,987
Sir, we floated the company

743
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,612
...affordable travel packages
for the middle class.

744
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:05,195
If you buy the company with such a huge
amount, you’ll increase the rates.

745
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:08,154
It will increasing their travel fare.

746
00:49:09,695 --> 00:49:10,779
So...

747
00:49:11,112 --> 00:49:12,654
So what ma’am is trying to say is...

748
00:49:14,362 --> 00:49:15,112
So...

749
00:49:17,612 --> 00:49:20,862
This generation has lost
the courage to say 'No'.

750
00:49:23,862 --> 00:49:24,779
Hey, Das!

751
00:49:24,904 --> 00:49:27,195
They can tussle with us and
still do business in the market?

752
00:49:28,154 --> 00:49:30,404
She’s a girl after all.
We’ll crush you.

753
00:49:30,862 --> 00:49:32,154
That’s a big warning.

754
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:41,404
Mr. Sudarshan....

755
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:44,029
I’m not so good at this pep talk.

756
00:50:44,237 --> 00:50:46,362
It will not match with
my personality either.

757
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,445
But the situation is demanding it.

758
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:51,404
Only two people have the power
to create something.

759
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:53,695
This planet and women.

760
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:55,695
Why do you want to mess with them?

761
00:50:56,404 --> 00:50:57,779
We just have to surrender.

762
00:50:58,112 --> 00:50:59,820
- Amulya, what’s happening?
- Hush!

763
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:04,779
If you’re still not convinced,
I have three options.

764
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:08,445
First... Beat your men and control you.

765
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,612
Second, hit you and control you.

766
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,904
Third, predicting that I will beat you
and control yourself.

767
00:51:17,112 --> 00:51:19,654
If you think controlling you is common
in all three options... You’re mistaken.

768
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,279
What’s common is I will be
smacking your men down.

769
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,237
For better or worse...

770
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:29,779
When someone says no
to your offer, it means...

771
00:51:33,654 --> 00:51:34,570
‘No!’

772
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:44,279
Most importantly, when a woman
says 'No', it means...

773
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:47,487
It's a 'No.'

774
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,529
Ma’am, we can’t be here after that
speech I just gave.

775
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:56,029
Let’s get out of here when
our energy levels are high. Come on...

776
00:52:09,154 --> 00:52:11,029
When I saw that guy in the morning...

777
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:14,779
It felt like I was looking
at my own reflection.

778
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:21,737
But when I see my own son
on the computer screen...

779
00:52:22,445 --> 00:52:25,695
He was struggling to say no...

780
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,695
His weakness felt like my own.

781
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,487
Is this my failure?

782
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,654
Ramu, you were a clerk.

783
00:52:44,237 --> 00:52:46,862
You had to impress my dad to marry me.

784
00:52:47,237 --> 00:52:48,570
You had to work hard for it.

785
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:51,237
But my son has nothing to prove.

786
00:52:51,862 --> 00:52:53,195
He was born a Prince.

787
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:56,070
Don’t compare him with others.
- I didn’t mean it, Yasu

788
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,737
I just meant that guy spoke well.

789
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:00,904
Ramu...

790
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:04,154
Suppose we’re on our honeymoon.

791
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,029
How would you feel if I say
some guy hot in front of you?

792
00:53:08,487 --> 00:53:09,695
Can you handle that?

793
00:53:10,904 --> 00:53:14,279
That’s how I feel when you praise
someone else’s son in front of me.

794
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:16,737
Don’t ever do that.

795
00:53:20,904 --> 00:53:23,779
A mother's love is blind.

796
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,112
That guy caught your attention.

797
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,945
But for me, it was the girl.

798
00:53:30,029 --> 00:53:32,695
She made a lot of progress with
the company in just 3 years.

799
00:53:33,195 --> 00:53:35,279
If she’s with us, she can do wonders.

800
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:38,070
How about we get your son married to her?

801
00:53:39,737 --> 00:53:41,570
She will bring the perfect balance.

802
00:53:47,737 --> 00:53:48,904
- Daddy...
- Yes, dear?

803
00:53:48,987 --> 00:53:50,404
Why do I have to wear a saree for dinner?

804
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:51,904
Because it’s a dinner invite from Mr. ARK.

805
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,737
I wouldn’t have cared
if it were someone else.

806
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,820
Don’t be so dumb.

807
00:53:55,945 --> 00:53:58,112
The saree and the bouquet
are to impress them.

808
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:00,820
Otherwise a box of sweets would do it.

809
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,070
Let's go.

810
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:07,112
In case they ask if you can cook...

811
00:54:07,362 --> 00:54:09,279
Casually lie that you’re almost good at it.

812
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,612
Why would they ask me if I could cook?

813
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:17,904
Is this an alliance?

814
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:19,570
Just a casual meeting, dear.

815
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,320
Besides, even if they were proposing
marriage... It’s no big deal for them.

816
00:54:23,154 --> 00:54:24,070
Dad!

817
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:25,237
Dear...

818
00:54:29,945 --> 00:54:30,945
What’s this?

819
00:54:31,237 --> 00:54:32,654
Give it to her if you like her.

820
00:54:34,654 --> 00:54:37,862
Grandpa said it would be a casual meeting.

821
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:41,070
You should tell him you won’t meet anyone
else because there your angel is at home.

822
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,820
Hello. Why are you laughing?

823
00:54:43,404 --> 00:54:44,695
Am I not your angel?

824
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:46,737
Get lost!

825
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:48,362
The box...

826
00:54:48,445 --> 00:54:49,695
- Get lost!
- Okay. Okay.

827
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,695
Hi. Welcome. Welcome.

828
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:52,820
I’m Ramachandra.

829
00:54:52,862 --> 00:54:53,820
I’m Anjaneya Prasad.

830
00:54:53,987 --> 00:54:55,237
Even my name suggests
I’m at your service.

831
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,779
- Hey! No! No!
- Dad!

832
00:54:57,029 --> 00:54:58,529
Dear, isn’t it true?

833
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,445
This old man has a knack for
inviting embarrassing guests.

834
00:55:03,737 --> 00:55:05,737
Hi. Hi. Hi.
Please come.

835
00:55:05,945 --> 00:55:07,320
Welcome. Welcome.

836
00:55:10,445 --> 00:55:11,362
What would you like to have?

837
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:12,945
We’re blessed to be sitting next to you.

838
00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:14,195
What more could we ask for?

839
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:17,362
We’ll eat whatever you serve.
As long as it’s edible.

840
00:55:18,529 --> 00:55:20,987
- You have good sense of humor.
- Thank you. Thank you.

841
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,404
You guys aren’t talking much.

842
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:33,987
Because you are.

843
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:38,362
My daughter is soft spoken.

844
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,112
Yeah, right. She doesn’t even bargain
when she goes shopping.

845
00:55:47,404 --> 00:55:48,904
Your son is soft spoken as well.

846
00:55:49,029 --> 00:55:50,737
He expressed it with a box.

847
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:52,029
Oh my god!

848
00:55:52,154 --> 00:55:53,487
Dear, you’re so lucky!

849
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:55,570
Fortune is calling.
My miserable days are over.

850
00:55:55,654 --> 00:55:59,070
Feels like the Lords of Wealth
are paying me a visit.

851
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:00,570
What are you looking at?
Get up!

852
00:56:00,779 --> 00:56:02,279
Give it a second thought.

853
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:04,195
I think it’s too fast.

854
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:06,904
This whole time, you were worried
about him being slow.

855
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:09,404
Now you’re worried that he’s going fast.

856
00:56:11,112 --> 00:56:11,945
Dad!

857
00:56:12,695 --> 00:56:15,404
What are you waiting for?
Let’s get them engaged.

858
00:56:21,237 --> 00:56:22,320
Why are you crying?

859
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:25,279
Tears of joy.

860
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:28,320
What are you doing here?

861
00:56:29,237 --> 00:56:31,529
Ma’am called me...
I thought she had some work...

862
00:56:33,945 --> 00:56:35,362
You don't have any work here.

863
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,029
Go!

864
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:50,529
Correct.

865
00:56:55,737 --> 00:56:56,695
Hey.

866
00:56:58,654 --> 00:57:01,070
I bought that ring so that
he will marry my daughter.

867
00:57:01,612 --> 00:57:02,945
He’s doing it.

868
00:57:03,445 --> 00:57:04,862
You turned this lunch into an engagement.

869
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:07,362
My daughter had a lot of expectations
on her wedding.

870
00:57:07,445 --> 00:57:10,779
Then let’s make sure we don’t fall short.

871
00:57:11,404 --> 00:57:13,487
My daughter will commit suicide
if she can’t marry him.

872
00:57:14,029 --> 00:57:15,779
She aspired to become Collector
when she was a kid.

873
00:57:15,862 --> 00:57:16,904
Did that happen?

874
00:57:17,112 --> 00:57:20,195
She will not do everything she says.

875
00:57:21,154 --> 00:57:22,195
Don’t worry.

876
00:57:22,529 --> 00:57:23,279
Come on.

877
00:57:27,469 --> 00:57:29,261
- Ma'am.
- This is all your fault.

878
00:57:29,386 --> 00:57:30,552
What did I do?

879
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:35,802
Because you hit Sudarshanam’s men
and Mr. Ramachandra noticed you.

880
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:39,011
Because he noticed you,
he spoke to my father.

881
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:41,969
Because he spoke to my father,
I had to get engaged.

882
00:57:44,511 --> 00:57:46,552
Did Sudarshanam get scared and back off?

883
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:49,886
He called us to the police station
for a meeting.

884
00:57:50,177 --> 00:57:51,927
- Don't worry, ma'am.
- Hey... Hey...

885
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:53,552
- Sit.
- Ma'am.

886
00:57:54,386 --> 00:57:55,927
No, you are angry.

887
00:58:00,136 --> 00:58:01,677
Is she your wife?

888
00:58:01,802 --> 00:58:02,886
No way.

889
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:04,677
She's my boss.

890
00:58:05,094 --> 00:58:06,552
But her body language says something else.

891
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:08,386
She’s scolding you with
so much confidence.

892
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,802
You can judge by body language? My foot!

893
00:58:11,302 --> 00:58:12,886
She already got engaged yesterday.

894
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:14,177
I don't think so.

895
00:58:14,302 --> 00:58:16,136
It'll work out soon.

896
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:17,469
What's gonna happen?

897
00:58:17,552 --> 00:58:19,177
You are not Ramachandra's son.

898
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:20,594
She's very practical.

899
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:22,219
Reddy influenced him…

900
00:58:22,386 --> 00:58:24,052
Hey, stop it... Stop it.

901
00:58:24,511 --> 00:58:26,594
It will work out, trust me.

902
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:28,344
- What are you saying?
- Really?

903
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,011
Morning, sir.

904
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:40,177
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

905
00:58:43,094 --> 00:58:45,761
- What's the issue?
- Sir, I gave her five crores.

906
00:58:46,177 --> 00:58:47,886
We asked for our money
and he got physical.

907
00:58:48,052 --> 00:58:51,594
He didn't just ask for money.
He wants the whole company.

908
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,469
On top of that, he was being
insensitive to girls.

909
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:55,761
That is when I hit him, sir.

910
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:58,719
- Did he cuss women?
- Yes, sir.

911
00:58:59,094 --> 00:59:01,386
Then you have to file a case on him.

912
00:59:03,802 --> 00:59:05,802
Hey... Call the writer.

913
00:59:06,511 --> 00:59:09,136
He’s not some fighter that
you’d call the writer.

914
00:59:09,594 --> 00:59:10,844
Look at him...

915
00:59:11,177 --> 00:59:13,761
Look at my bodyguard, above six feet.

916
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:16,427
How can we believe this guy hit him?
- You have a point.

917
00:59:16,802 --> 00:59:18,469
That’s a lie, sir. I hit him.

918
00:59:19,886 --> 00:59:21,302
I’ll hit him again if I have to.

919
00:59:38,969 --> 00:59:41,052
- Can you notice any difference?
- What difference?

920
00:59:41,427 --> 00:59:43,344
He was standing till now,
but now he is sitting there.

921
00:59:45,802 --> 00:59:48,052
Maybe he is tired standing,
so he sat down

922
00:59:48,177 --> 00:59:50,427
I hit him and he fell there.

923
00:59:50,636 --> 00:59:52,302
- Give me a break.
- Sir.

924
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:54,886
I hit him when you bent down.
He was in the air when you stood up.

925
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:56,344
He was sitting by the time you saw him.

926
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,594
Dear...

927
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,136
Why don't you take him to a good doctor?

928
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:03,094
Yes, sir... I'll do that.

929
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:19,636
What’s wrong? What happened?

930
01:00:19,886 --> 01:00:22,761
It's a stylish fight scene sir...
Things like these don’t happen often.

931
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:25,052
All of you together made it a big lie.

932
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:26,511
I'm hurt.

933
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:27,844
You are hurt?

934
01:00:29,594 --> 01:00:32,094
- What's your problem?
- I just hit him again, sir.

935
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,552
But I didn't see it.

936
01:00:33,677 --> 01:00:35,677
- Call him back. I can hit him again.
- That's wrong.

937
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:39,552
You can’t say things like that
to the police.

938
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:42,886
You don’t believe me when I say I hit him.
You don’t look when I actually hit him.

939
01:00:43,052 --> 01:00:44,094
You don’t agree when offer
to hit him again.

940
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:45,677
You’re impossible, sir.
- Bantu!

941
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:46,844
Dear...

942
01:00:47,094 --> 01:00:49,761
Why do you want to get locked up?

943
01:00:49,927 --> 01:00:52,219
- You have a bright future.
- I know, sir.

944
01:00:53,011 --> 01:00:55,636
Don't interrupt me while I talk!
I'll kill you!

945
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:58,511
- Dear, what does he do for you?
- Annoy me.

946
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:00,677
So nobody believes I hit him.

947
01:01:01,844 --> 01:01:03,427
Hey! This is your final chance.

948
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:04,969
I’ll ask her.

949
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:07,427
Whatever she says is final.

950
01:01:07,594 --> 01:01:09,594
- You should stand by that.
- Yes.

951
01:01:09,886 --> 01:01:13,136
- Did he beat that guy?
- No, sir! Not at all!

952
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:15,594
- He’s so sweet!
- Discussion over!

953
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:18,219
Ma’am, you are also lying.

954
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,636
Why are you so keen on getting arrested?

955
01:01:23,011 --> 01:01:24,552
But I had to tell the truth.

956
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:26,594
I don’t want the engagement.
Did I say it out?

957
01:01:27,136 --> 01:01:29,302
- We can’t tell the truth all the time.
- Exactly.

958
01:01:29,636 --> 01:01:31,844
Nothing will go wrong
if you tell the truth, ma’am.

959
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:33,969
You should do the same with your dad.

960
01:01:34,136 --> 01:01:36,261
I told him. He said he’ll commit suicide.

961
01:01:36,469 --> 01:01:38,094
Then tell Raj’s father.

962
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:40,886
Mr. Ramachandra? No ways!

963
01:01:41,094 --> 01:01:43,052
Ma’am… Ma’am…
Listen to me please…

964
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:44,761
Try telling Mr. Ramachandra once.

965
01:01:45,052 --> 01:01:47,844
- Trust me and tell the truth.
- Okay, I will.

966
01:01:48,427 --> 01:01:49,386
Give me that.

967
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:52,219
Telling the truth solves
all problems, ma’am.

968
01:01:52,386 --> 01:01:53,927
It really feels light.

969
01:01:54,136 --> 01:01:55,511
Because I took the bag from you?

970
01:01:57,386 --> 01:01:58,636
No, you idiot!

971
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:00,302
I meant I feel lighter.

972
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:02,344
I feel lighter! Bantu!!

973
01:02:05,136 --> 01:02:08,261
It’s obvious to be scared
when you hit someone suddenly.

974
01:02:08,386 --> 01:02:10,427
He’s an idiot, man.
Why do you care if he’s scared?

975
01:02:10,677 --> 01:02:13,386
- I don’t mean him. I’m scared! Me!
- You’re scared. I get it.

976
01:02:13,594 --> 01:02:15,261
I have full clarity now.

977
01:02:16,052 --> 01:02:18,386
Sorry, Bantu. Are you hurt?

978
01:02:18,927 --> 01:02:21,636
Yes, but it feels good, ma’am.

979
01:02:21,886 --> 01:02:23,011
Ma’am...

980
01:02:23,802 --> 01:02:25,802
You are beating me.

981
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:27,427
Don’t call me ma’am.

982
01:02:29,427 --> 01:02:31,427
It'll take time ma'am

983
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:33,802
Call me Amulya.

984
01:02:34,969 --> 01:02:36,302
I know your name, ma'am.

985
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:40,261
Actually, I like Ammu.

986
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:43,761
It'll take time, ma'am

987
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,469
It'll take lot of time.

988
01:02:46,344 --> 01:02:49,094
Did she fall for you?
I already told you.

989
01:02:49,677 --> 01:02:50,802
Get out!

990
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:03,802
“Who can be a better match to me?
Why didn’t I realize this before, Ammu?”

991
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:05,969
“Love is like chewing gum”

992
01:03:06,094 --> 01:03:08,136
“It sticks with you and doesn’t let go”

993
01:03:08,469 --> 01:03:10,511
“People have said this before”

994
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:12,177
“But let me say it again”

995
01:03:12,386 --> 01:03:14,344
“I can’t hold it in”

996
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:16,677
“You can’t restrain from love”

997
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:24,469
“You are everything I’ve been looking for”

998
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:32,594
“You became a part of me before I knew it”

999
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,177
"Hey, pretty doll"

1000
01:03:35,302 --> 01:03:37,302
“You’ve surrounded my thoughts”

1001
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:41,344
“You’ve held my hand in togetherness”

1002
01:03:41,636 --> 01:03:43,636
"Hey, pretty doll"

1003
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:45,761
“You’ve surrounded my thoughts”

1004
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:49,802
“You’ve held my hand in togetherness”

1005
01:03:58,594 --> 01:04:02,219
"I might have been quiet
like multiplex audience"

1006
01:04:02,427 --> 01:04:04,344
"But there are drums playing in my heart"

1007
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:06,802
"I might have just had a brain freeze"

1008
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:44,344
“This isn’t the Kings’ times,
no chariot or horses”

1009
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:48,094
“I fight a battle against myself
in front of the mirror”

1010
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:52,719
“You put forward your hands filled
with bangles  and come close”

1011
01:04:52,844 --> 01:04:56,886
“You caress my cheeks and make me
feel like a King”

1012
01:04:57,011 --> 01:05:00,594
“I asked for pitter patter raindrops”

1013
01:05:00,844 --> 01:05:04,761
“You’ve given me a cyclone”

1014
01:05:05,386 --> 01:05:09,344
“I asked for a little jasmine”

1015
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:12,969
“You showered me with flowers”

1016
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:15,386
"Hey, pretty doll"

1017
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,511
“You’ve surrounded my thoughts”

1018
01:05:17,636 --> 01:05:21,552
“You’ve held my hand in togetherness”

1019
01:05:21,844 --> 01:05:25,761
“You’ve made me an eternal part of you”

1020
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:29,844
“You’ve given me a special
place in your heart”

1021
01:05:38,761 --> 01:05:42,386
“Who can be a better match to me?
Why didn’t I realize this before, Ammu?”

1022
01:05:42,594 --> 01:05:44,552
“Love is like chewing gum”

1023
01:05:44,677 --> 01:05:46,719
“It sticks with you and doesn’t let go”

1024
01:05:47,052 --> 01:05:49,094
“People have said this before”

1025
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:50,761
“But let me say it again”

1026
01:05:50,969 --> 01:05:52,927
“I can’t hold it in”

1027
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:55,302
“You can’t restrain from love”

1028
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:12,927
Sir...

1029
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:14,302
Sir...

1030
01:06:14,636 --> 01:06:15,886
He’ll be seeing you now.

1031
01:06:16,594 --> 01:06:17,927
I’m Appala Naidu.

1032
01:06:18,219 --> 01:06:21,136
I control everything in the port.

1033
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:25,011
I got my son into college
so that he has a different lifestyle.

1034
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:29,177
I sent him to you with money
because your company needed it.

1035
01:06:30,511 --> 01:06:32,927
My son made it clear that
we don’t need your money.

1036
01:06:35,052 --> 01:06:37,802
Your son might listen to whatever you say.

1037
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:40,802
But I'll give my son whatever her asks for.

1038
01:06:41,219 --> 01:06:43,261
If you try to stop it.

1039
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:54,927
People from Kolkata love
to eat fish brains.

1040
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:57,261
People from Andhra love its tail.

1041
01:06:57,386 --> 01:07:00,469
But the fish loves to live.

1042
01:07:10,094 --> 01:07:13,511
To do so, it must stay farther away
from the net.

1043
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:17,261
Once it falls into the net,
there’s no going back.

1044
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:27,302
Let’s tell him later… Not now.

1045
01:07:27,469 --> 01:07:28,927
We've have come very far...

1046
01:07:29,094 --> 01:07:30,552
Let's tell the truth.

1047
01:07:38,844 --> 01:07:40,177
Where is he?

1048
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:43,136
Maybe he is in the restroom.

1049
01:07:44,177 --> 01:07:46,552
- Sit down.
- It’s okay.

1050
01:07:57,844 --> 01:07:59,052
Sir.

1051
01:08:03,552 --> 01:08:04,636
Sir.

1052
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:06,302
Sir.

1053
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:13,052
- Shall I call the ambulance?
- No… Call the car driver.

1054
01:08:20,802 --> 01:08:21,844
Hey! Hey!

1055
01:08:40,636 --> 01:08:41,761
Where’s the staircase?

1056
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:53,344
Bantu!

1057
01:08:55,177 --> 01:08:56,094
What happened?

1058
01:09:00,927 --> 01:09:03,302
- Any chances of making it?
- Only God can save him now.

1059
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:05,386
God doesn’t exist anymore.

1060
01:09:05,969 --> 01:09:07,511
Move... Let him breathe.

1061
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:10,302
- Shall I call his family?
- Not now... Later.

1062
01:09:10,469 --> 01:09:11,844
Sir. Sir.

1063
01:09:34,511 --> 01:09:35,469
Bantu!

1064
01:09:59,552 --> 01:10:00,469
Hey!

1065
01:10:04,594 --> 01:10:06,761
- That’s our car.
- We only stabbed him.

1066
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:07,761
Let it go.

1067
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:10,761
- You said he had no chance.
- You said God didn’t exist.

1068
01:10:20,594 --> 01:10:22,094
Sir. Sir.

1069
01:10:25,094 --> 01:10:26,511
I'll inform his family.

1070
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,177
Calm down, ma’am.

1071
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,469
One moment.

1072
01:11:13,386 --> 01:11:14,552
Ra... Ra...

1073
01:11:18,052 --> 01:11:19,261
Ramachandra?

1074
01:11:20,427 --> 01:11:21,677
Do you know him?

1075
01:11:24,636 --> 01:11:26,219
- What…
- What happened?

1076
01:11:27,219 --> 01:11:28,386
Someone...

1077
01:11:29,636 --> 01:11:30,552
Umm...

1078
01:11:31,302 --> 01:11:34,302
He met with a small accident.

1079
01:11:35,052 --> 01:11:38,177
Don’t worry. He’s fine.

1080
01:11:40,136 --> 01:11:43,427
Is he your father?

1081
01:11:44,136 --> 01:11:45,761
My father?

1082
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,136
Sadly, no.

1083
01:11:49,302 --> 01:11:50,177
No.

1084
01:11:54,219 --> 01:11:56,594
He's my father.

1085
01:11:57,636 --> 01:11:58,636
He's there.

1086
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:18,386
[GASPING]

1087
01:12:19,511 --> 01:12:20,677
Tell me.

1088
01:12:21,302 --> 01:12:23,469
That’s not your father.

1089
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:26,886
Your father is... Ra... Ra... Rama...

1090
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:29,011
It doesn’t change the fact
that he’s my father.

1091
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,386
You need to relax.

1092
01:12:31,386 --> 01:12:33,719
Please sit, sir.
I’ll check if ma'am is here.

1093
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:39,261
He’s... He’s not your father.

1094
01:12:40,386 --> 01:12:43,969
Ah! He’s not your father.

1095
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:47,761
I don’t think you’re feeling well.
Let me call the doctor.

1096
01:12:47,886 --> 01:12:50,177
Wait a minute... Stop talking.

1097
01:12:53,386 --> 01:12:55,636
He’s... not your father.

1098
01:12:58,302 --> 01:13:00,011
He’s Valmiki.

1099
01:13:02,386 --> 01:13:03,761
You know my father?

1100
01:13:04,386 --> 01:13:05,469
Valmiki...

1101
01:13:07,052 --> 01:13:08,427
Valmiki is not your father.

1102
01:13:08,677 --> 01:13:10,302
Valmiki is not your father.

1103
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:14,386
Ramachandra...

1104
01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:18,719
Ramachandra... is your father.

1105
01:13:21,636 --> 01:13:23,677
What do you mean?
I don’t get it.

1106
01:13:23,802 --> 01:13:26,469
Yes... Ramachandra is your father.

1107
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:29,844
I only switched you.

1108
01:13:33,469 --> 01:13:36,011
You didn’t move when you were born.

1109
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:39,469
Before I could tell the doctor about it...

1110
01:13:59,094 --> 01:14:01,552
Your... Your name?

1111
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:03,802
Bantu.

1112
01:14:07,344 --> 01:14:08,677
You were born as Raj (King).

1113
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:13,011
You are the real Raj (King).

1114
01:14:15,844 --> 01:14:18,136
I picked you up from the rich side...

1115
01:14:18,511 --> 01:14:21,552
And put you into a poor family.

1116
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:23,511
That guilt is killing me.

1117
01:14:23,969 --> 01:14:26,761
Only the God and I know that.

1118
01:14:27,302 --> 01:14:32,886
I have to tell this to your father
before I die.

1119
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,261
I should only tell him.

1120
01:14:36,511 --> 01:14:38,011
Call him...

1121
01:14:38,469 --> 01:14:40,469
Raj... Call your father.

1122
01:14:40,802 --> 01:14:41,636
Call him!

1123
01:14:42,094 --> 01:14:44,052
Get Ramachandra here.

1124
01:14:44,094 --> 01:14:45,386
Call him.

1125
01:14:45,511 --> 01:14:48,886
Raj... Raj... Call your father.

1126
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:50,677
Get Ramachandra.

1127
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:51,927
Call him.

1128
01:14:52,886 --> 01:14:54,052
He's inside.

1129
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:12,469
What is the patient doing here?

1130
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,927
- Sister, what are you doing?
- Sir...

1131
01:15:18,177 --> 01:15:19,261
You’re supposed to be alert.

1132
01:15:19,594 --> 01:15:20,886
What is this patient doing here?

1133
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:24,011
- Is Dr. Bhaskar Reddy available?
- Yes, sir.

1134
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:26,011
- Let’s shift her to critical care.
- Okay, sir.

1135
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:27,636
Hello...

1136
01:16:04,844 --> 01:16:05,677
Sir...

1137
01:16:06,636 --> 01:16:08,552
My daughter…
- On the way, sir.

1138
01:16:11,469 --> 01:16:12,636
I spoke with the doctors.

1139
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,511
His heart is totally fine.
Just some blood loss.

1140
01:16:14,761 --> 01:16:16,219
He should recover soon.

1141
01:16:16,344 --> 01:16:18,177
No issues so far...
I have it all sorted.

1142
01:16:18,886 --> 01:16:20,177
I don’t think so, Kasi.

1143
01:16:20,594 --> 01:16:21,761
What about security?

1144
01:16:44,469 --> 01:16:45,469
Hello, ma’am.

1145
01:16:46,386 --> 01:16:48,177
- Where’s father?
- He’s sitting in the back.

1146
01:16:48,552 --> 01:16:49,969
- Call him.
- Okay, ma’am.

1147
01:17:01,761 --> 01:17:02,677
Bantu?

1148
01:17:03,427 --> 01:17:04,261
Who is he?

1149
01:17:06,636 --> 01:17:08,552
Bantu. He works in my office.

1150
01:17:09,011 --> 01:17:11,177
So it’s you brother-in-law was
bragging about.

1151
01:17:13,136 --> 01:17:15,427
Actually, he saved uncle.

1152
01:17:17,886 --> 01:17:19,761
He was also at the hotel last time.

1153
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:22,136
I didn’t notice.

1154
01:17:25,511 --> 01:17:27,302
Ask him to wait downstairs.
I’ll talk to him later.

1155
01:17:27,761 --> 01:17:28,761
Thanks.

1156
01:17:30,552 --> 01:17:32,636
It’s okay. Don’t feel bad, Bantu.

1157
01:17:44,636 --> 01:17:46,844
Father, DCP wants to talk to you.

1158
01:17:47,802 --> 01:17:48,802
Thank you.

1159
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:50,386
Come dear.

1160
01:17:51,636 --> 01:17:52,886
Just one second.

1161
01:17:54,511 --> 01:17:55,636
Let’s go.

1162
01:17:55,969 --> 01:17:57,427
This is how the rich people are...

1163
01:17:57,886 --> 01:18:00,219
They never fail to remind us our place.

1164
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,636
We can never be one of them.

1165
01:18:05,844 --> 01:18:07,386
I’ve been working for them since 25 years.

1166
01:18:09,594 --> 01:18:11,636
But they never let me in.

1167
01:18:12,094 --> 01:18:15,052
We should get used to this.

1168
01:18:15,177 --> 01:18:16,136
That’s the way it is.

1169
01:18:18,094 --> 01:18:19,011
We’re strangers

1170
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:20,677
We must behave like strangers.

1171
01:18:22,177 --> 01:18:23,302
You know what they say.

1172
01:18:23,552 --> 01:18:25,886
A King’s Palace hosts the prosperous alone.

1173
01:18:26,427 --> 01:18:29,719
Just because he’s gotten close with us...

1174
01:18:31,886 --> 01:18:33,219
We shouldn’t think like that.

1175
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:36,386
She’s no more.

1176
01:18:39,302 --> 01:18:40,261
Poor lady.

1177
01:18:46,844 --> 01:18:47,886
Take her away.

1178
01:18:52,302 --> 01:18:53,802
You know her?

1179
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:55,969
Must be an orphan.

1180
01:18:56,636 --> 01:18:58,302
You know I am very sensitive.

1181
01:18:58,594 --> 01:18:59,594
I can’t take it.

1182
01:19:00,511 --> 01:19:02,302
She must’ve done something really bad.

1183
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:03,802
She had a remorseful death.

1184
01:19:04,427 --> 01:19:06,052
God’s watching over all of us.

1185
01:19:13,094 --> 01:19:14,511
You have something to say?

1186
01:19:22,802 --> 01:19:24,636
Hey! How dare you!

1187
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:31,761
I’m annoyed listening to your lies
from childhood.

1188
01:19:33,011 --> 01:19:34,886
But you never stop it.

1189
01:19:36,427 --> 01:19:38,302
Actually, why don’t you take a break?

1190
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:44,386
Relax!

1191
01:19:45,761 --> 01:19:46,761
Relax.

1192
01:20:06,572 --> 01:20:07,364
Hey!

1193
01:20:07,906 --> 01:20:09,531
Sit properly... You are leaning on me.

1194
01:20:10,656 --> 01:20:12,114
As soon as you do something good...

1195
01:20:12,156 --> 01:20:13,572
You can’t resist doing something worse.

1196
01:20:14,531 --> 01:20:16,322
You can directly ask why I hit you.

1197
01:20:16,447 --> 01:20:17,739
Why are you beating around the bush?

1198
01:20:22,907 --> 01:20:23,907
Get off

1199
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:29,739
You just hit your dad and you’re passing
statements about it?

1200
01:20:31,406 --> 01:20:34,697
Bah! We’re in the middle of the road.
You have something to say?

1201
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:38,197
You’re not real father.

1202
01:20:38,531 --> 01:20:39,989
That is why I hit you.

1203
01:20:53,156 --> 01:20:54,906
I’m not your father?

1204
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:57,906
I’m not your father?

1205
01:20:58,322 --> 01:20:59,697
How do you think you were born then?

1206
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:01,489
Did you pop out of thin air?

1207
01:21:01,864 --> 01:21:03,197
No, I didn’t.

1208
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:05,156
You got me down.

1209
01:21:17,947 --> 01:21:19,822
That nurse was in coma for 25 years.

1210
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:23,364
How can you believe whatever she mumbles?

1211
01:21:24,531 --> 01:21:26,489
I don’t remember mentioning anything
about a nurse.

1212
01:21:40,614 --> 01:21:41,531
Tell me.

1213
01:21:43,197 --> 01:21:44,697
Is Ramachandra my father?

1214
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:47,739
Yes or no?

1215
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,364
Valmiki!

1216
01:21:52,156 --> 01:21:54,739
You couldn’t shut up ever since I was born.
Now speak up!

1217
01:21:55,864 --> 01:21:56,947
Tell me!

1218
01:21:57,322 --> 01:21:58,281
I...

1219
01:21:58,989 --> 01:22:00,072
I just wanted my son to be happy.

1220
01:22:00,364 --> 01:22:03,447
I get that part.
But why did you torture me?

1221
01:22:08,614 --> 01:22:10,114
You are jealous of my father.

1222
01:22:10,489 --> 01:22:13,447
He started along with you and became
a millionaire in no time.

1223
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:14,906
You couldn’t take it.

1224
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:17,364
But there’s nothing you can do to him.

1225
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:19,656
So you picture Ramachandra in me.

1226
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:23,864
Exactly why you’ve been troubling me
since 25 years.

1227
01:22:26,906 --> 01:22:28,114
You drove me crazy.

1228
01:22:28,697 --> 01:22:30,114
What have I done to you, huh?

1229
01:22:38,697 --> 01:22:40,447
Drink it... You look like
you’re going to die.

1230
01:22:51,489 --> 01:22:53,822
Will you reveal everything and
expose me in front of everyone?

1231
01:22:54,947 --> 01:22:56,947
Will you ruin my son’s life?

1232
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,947
I'm begging you.
Please don’t tell anyone.

1233
01:23:00,364 --> 01:23:03,239
If I reveal the truth...

1234
01:23:04,781 --> 01:23:06,864
They will abandon your son right away.

1235
01:23:07,281 --> 01:23:08,989
His mother will become his madam.

1236
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:10,739
His father will become his boss.

1237
01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:13,156
A clerk like you will be his real father.

1238
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:15,197
He will commit suicide out of depression
and die.

1239
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:19,822
I considered all this and chose
to be silent back there.

1240
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,906
Besides, it’s my mother who’s going to weep
if I expose you.

1241
01:23:25,822 --> 01:23:28,114
I can’t call her auntie after she
nurtured me for all these years.

1242
01:23:28,947 --> 01:23:31,489
I can’t call her my mom
just for the sake of wealth.

1243
01:23:33,864 --> 01:23:38,031
I don’t want your wealth or their stature.
You only keep it. I don’t need it.

1244
01:23:43,656 --> 01:23:45,489
When you don’t want any of it...

1245
01:23:46,364 --> 01:23:48,156
What do you get from knowing the truth?

1246
01:23:48,197 --> 01:23:49,322
Freedom!

1247
01:23:50,031 --> 01:23:52,156
The freedom of knowing that
I don’t have to impress you.

1248
01:23:53,031 --> 01:23:56,156
Ever since I was a kid,
I’ve been looking for ways to impress you.

1249
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,489
Now I realized you’re not going
to like me after all.

1250
01:23:58,739 --> 01:23:59,864
I’ve found my answer.

1251
01:24:00,072 --> 01:24:01,156
I’m free.

1252
01:24:01,906 --> 01:24:02,822
Free!

1253
01:24:06,072 --> 01:24:07,197
Valmiki...

1254
01:24:08,114 --> 01:24:09,239
Valmiki...

1255
01:24:10,281 --> 01:24:11,906
I always get irritated when I see you.

1256
01:24:11,989 --> 01:24:14,156
But for the first time,
I feel sorry for you.

1257
01:24:15,031 --> 01:24:17,572
Because... You can’t
claim him as your son.

1258
01:24:17,947 --> 01:24:19,364
I won’t accept you as my father.

1259
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:21,614
Few lives don’t get any better. Very bad!

1260
01:24:28,531 --> 01:24:29,906
My vehicle has insurance.

1261
01:24:29,989 --> 01:24:32,614
I have assurance he won’t tell anyone.

1262
01:24:32,947 --> 01:24:34,114
Oh God!

1263
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:39,156
Mother...

1264
01:24:41,322 --> 01:24:42,656
Aren’t you feeling well?

1265
01:24:43,364 --> 01:24:45,031
Sister told me you didn't eat anything.

1266
01:24:45,156 --> 01:24:47,364
I’ve been having temperature
since evening.

1267
01:24:47,614 --> 01:24:48,531
Your boiling.

1268
01:24:48,781 --> 01:24:50,406
Wait. I’ll get you some medicine.

1269
01:24:50,906 --> 01:24:51,864
Wait.

1270
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:53,364
No.

1271
01:24:53,614 --> 01:24:56,281
You can’t stay like this...
Get medicines, go.

1272
01:24:57,156 --> 01:24:58,406
No need.

1273
01:24:58,572 --> 01:25:00,031
I just want my kids to comfort me.

1274
01:25:00,156 --> 01:25:01,822
I will get better.

1275
01:25:09,531 --> 01:25:10,906
- Valmiki…
- Sir?

1276
01:25:11,614 --> 01:25:14,531
I want to meet your son.

1277
01:25:15,864 --> 01:25:18,322
I'll give him a hug and thank him.

1278
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,489
- Get him once.
- Excuse me.

1279
01:25:20,822 --> 01:25:22,572
I’m the doctor that
treated your son-in-law.

1280
01:25:22,739 --> 01:25:23,906
She’s the nurse that assisted me.

1281
01:25:24,031 --> 01:25:25,906
You need to hug the both of us
and thank us.

1282
01:25:25,947 --> 01:25:26,906
That will make some sense.

1283
01:25:26,947 --> 01:25:28,322
How could you think someone else
is more important?

1284
01:25:28,447 --> 01:25:29,447
- Who is he!?
- Hey!

1285
01:25:29,614 --> 01:25:30,489
Hey! I’m the doctor.

1286
01:25:30,572 --> 01:25:32,156
This room is for stitching.
Not for stretching, okay?

1287
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:33,739
- What the hell are you talking?
- What are you talking, oldie?

1288
01:25:33,822 --> 01:25:35,322
Come with me for a moment.

1289
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:38,072
We shouldn’t upset doctors and drivers.

1290
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:39,989
The syringes and steering wheels
are in their control.

1291
01:25:40,114 --> 01:25:41,531
- Let’s get out of here.
- Please leave!

1292
01:25:41,656 --> 01:25:43,072
What’s the matter, dad?

1293
01:25:44,614 --> 01:25:45,489
Shh!

1294
01:26:39,281 --> 01:26:41,197
You were supposed to be here yesterday.

1295
01:26:42,156 --> 01:26:44,489
But no one told me about it.

1296
01:26:44,656 --> 01:26:50,072
A son is supposed to check on
his father and mother...

1297
01:26:50,614 --> 01:26:54,656
Also on what’s going on around the house.

1298
01:26:55,447 --> 01:26:56,906
Nobody will tell you.

1299
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:00,489
I can’t believe you brought a bouquet
like some stranger.

1300
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:08,739
- How much is the bill?
- 1.2 lakhs, sir.

1301
01:27:09,156 --> 01:27:10,281
Make it round figure. 10 lakhs.

1302
01:27:10,489 --> 01:27:12,322
Round figure for 1.2 lakhs would be 1 lakh.

1303
01:27:12,406 --> 01:27:13,322
Not 10 lakhs.

1304
01:27:13,656 --> 01:27:15,572
Oh. You’re not Subrahmanyam.

1305
01:27:15,947 --> 01:27:17,239
- No.
- What’s up, sir?

1306
01:27:17,489 --> 01:27:20,072
He knows nothing about round figures.

1307
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:21,114
Explain it to him.

1308
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:25,656
- If we charge the medicines at 10 lakhs...
- This bill is going to top Jayalalitha’s.

1309
01:27:26,114 --> 01:27:27,864
Luckily she didn’t have a brother like him…

1310
01:27:27,947 --> 01:27:30,031
Otherwise, her bill would have crossed
the state budget.

1311
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:37,572
Her husband is in a critical condition.

1312
01:27:37,864 --> 01:27:40,072
And yet, she hasn’t shed a single tear.

1313
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:46,447
Unlike we middle class people,
she didn’t sob for him.

1314
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:49,156
Pin drop silence.

1315
01:27:49,489 --> 01:27:50,447
Really?

1316
01:27:51,364 --> 01:27:52,114
Yeah!

1317
01:27:52,864 --> 01:27:53,864
What?

1318
01:27:54,656 --> 01:27:56,739
They’re of a different class.

1319
01:27:57,197 --> 01:27:58,322
Different class?

1320
01:27:58,656 --> 01:27:59,864
Are you crazy?

1321
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:02,031
Husband and wife don’t have
a proper conversation.

1322
01:28:02,406 --> 01:28:04,614
His son gets him a bouquet like
he’s an stranger.

1323
01:28:05,656 --> 01:28:07,197
Don’t even get me started
on his brother-in-law.

1324
01:28:07,322 --> 01:28:09,697
He’s looting all their money in
the name of hospital bills.

1325
01:28:10,072 --> 01:28:11,406
Why do we care about them?

1326
01:28:11,947 --> 01:28:12,989
I don’t get it.

1327
01:28:13,156 --> 01:28:15,214
How come father and son
are having a conversation

1328
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:16,596
without turning it into a fight?

1329
01:28:16,739 --> 01:28:17,572
It’s nothing.

1330
01:28:17,656 --> 01:28:20,739
I was telling him that
house is like a temple.

1331
01:28:21,114 --> 01:28:25,322
And the couple is like
Lord Shiva and Parvathi.

1332
01:28:25,406 --> 01:28:26,906
That's it.

1333
01:28:27,156 --> 01:28:28,281
You call that a temple?

1334
01:28:28,531 --> 01:28:30,656
Who are you then?
The priest’s sidekick?

1335
01:28:31,281 --> 01:28:33,114
Not a single member in that family
has values.

1336
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:35,114
If they keep this going...

1337
01:28:36,364 --> 01:28:37,572
My father will die soon.

1338
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,281
Stop bragging that he is your father.

1339
01:28:41,364 --> 01:28:42,447
I’m your father.

1340
01:28:42,989 --> 01:28:45,656
If you ever say that again,
I’ll kill your mom and kill myself next.

1341
01:28:45,739 --> 01:28:46,864
I swear on God!

1342
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:48,697
Why are you getting my mom into this?

1343
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:50,489
Because you wouldn’t care if I died alone.

1344
01:28:55,031 --> 01:28:56,489
You have something to say now?

1345
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:00,031
I want to go to that house.

1346
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:03,072
What happened?

1347
01:29:03,531 --> 01:29:05,531
- Dad choked.
- Give him some water.

1348
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:06,697
I’m at it.

1349
01:29:07,281 --> 01:29:08,281
Drink.

1350
01:29:08,822 --> 01:29:09,656
Drink it.

1351
01:29:12,531 --> 01:29:16,781
You’ve been checking on your son
since the last 25 years.

1352
01:29:17,364 --> 01:29:20,864
Now it’s my turn to check on my dad.

1353
01:29:21,364 --> 01:29:21,989
Hey...

1354
01:29:22,072 --> 01:29:24,364
Relax! Relax!

1355
01:29:24,822 --> 01:29:26,906
You can check on your Prince.

1356
01:29:27,114 --> 01:29:30,031
But I can’t check on my King, huh?

1357
01:29:32,364 --> 01:29:35,406
Even if you’re in the same room
with Ramachandra...

1358
01:29:36,197 --> 01:29:38,739
He’s going to take you in right away.
You’re his blood after all.

1359
01:29:40,156 --> 01:29:43,781
That is what kept me from taking you
to that house.

1360
01:29:46,156 --> 01:29:48,447
Besides, would you stay away
once you got in?

1361
01:29:51,614 --> 01:29:54,447
You’re like a chewing gum stuck
on the shoe.

1362
01:29:55,197 --> 01:29:56,864
I’ll never let you go there.

1363
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:59,822
Who can get me in other than you?
You’re going to take me there.

1364
01:30:00,156 --> 01:30:01,656
- Me?
- Yeah. Tomorrow.

1365
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:14,156
You better lose the T-shirts
for a while, sir.

1366
01:30:14,322 --> 01:30:15,531
Shirts will be comfortable.

1367
01:30:16,322 --> 01:30:17,906
- Why?
- Ugh, not again!

1368
01:30:18,156 --> 01:30:21,489
My son-in-law is not too
old to wear a t-shirt.

1369
01:30:22,364 --> 01:30:24,739
Hey! What does a T-shirt
have to do with it?

1370
01:30:24,864 --> 01:30:27,781
Wearing a dhoti doesn’t make you
any better.

1371
01:30:29,114 --> 01:30:30,947
Calm down, doctor.

1372
01:30:32,614 --> 01:30:33,531
Sir...

1373
01:30:33,947 --> 01:30:34,822
Your shirt.

1374
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:37,864
T-shirt!

1375
01:30:39,614 --> 01:30:40,406
Muscle!

1376
01:30:40,697 --> 01:30:42,197
Strain! That’s the reason.

1377
01:30:42,906 --> 01:30:43,822
No.

1378
01:30:43,989 --> 01:30:45,947
But you don’t understand.

1379
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:47,531
You can wear shorts if you want.

1380
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:49,656
Your calves will get some fresh air.
What about you?

1381
01:30:50,531 --> 01:30:51,239
What?

1382
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:54,031
-  Not again !
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hello...

1383
01:30:54,489 --> 01:30:55,572
Are you okay?

1384
01:30:55,989 --> 01:30:56,947
I’m okay, sir.

1385
01:30:58,656 --> 01:31:02,906
He needs pleasant people around.

1386
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:04,447
Especially people unlike us.

1387
01:31:04,656 --> 01:31:05,739
Like...

1388
01:31:07,072 --> 01:31:10,322
That guy who brought him to the hospital.

1389
01:31:10,572 --> 01:31:12,906
Why don’t you just call the same guy?

1390
01:31:15,531 --> 01:31:16,364
Valmiki.

1391
01:31:16,614 --> 01:31:17,489
Come here!

1392
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:18,322
Sir...

1393
01:31:19,239 --> 01:31:20,031
See?

1394
01:31:20,489 --> 01:31:23,781
Your son-in-law’s BP came back to normal
as soon as I mentioned that guy.

1395
01:31:25,281 --> 01:31:27,781
How is his presence going to help
medically, doctor?

1396
01:31:27,947 --> 01:31:29,281
You will see for yourself.

1397
01:31:29,822 --> 01:31:34,031
In the movies, a child gets better
when his mom or dad visits him.

1398
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:35,197
You believe in that stuff.

1399
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,989
But you don’t believe in an over qualified
doctor like me.

1400
01:31:38,114 --> 01:31:39,822
You question my credibility.
- Sir...

1401
01:31:40,197 --> 01:31:40,947
Don’t touch me!

1402
01:31:41,031 --> 01:31:42,489
But you didn’t want him here last time.

1403
01:31:44,406 --> 01:31:45,197
Answer him.

1404
01:31:45,531 --> 01:31:46,531
I will.

1405
01:31:47,697 --> 01:31:48,697
Didn’t you say that?

1406
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,781
I did, sir.

1407
01:31:49,989 --> 01:31:51,239
But people change.

1408
01:31:51,489 --> 01:31:52,531
Give me a chance, will you?

1409
01:31:52,697 --> 01:31:55,239
Even doctors and drivers have kids.

1410
01:32:00,156 --> 01:32:02,364
The doctor’s BP might rise from
all the yelling.

1411
01:32:02,947 --> 01:32:04,072
Go get him.

1412
01:32:04,156 --> 01:32:05,864
He’ll be at work now.

1413
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:07,364
Ask him to take permission for a few hours.

1414
01:32:07,489 --> 01:32:09,656
- It’s not a Government office.
- Ask him to take the rest of the day off.

1415
01:32:09,947 --> 01:32:10,989
What reason would he give?

1416
01:32:11,072 --> 01:32:12,614
Just ask him to quit the job.
Good-riddance!

1417
01:32:12,697 --> 01:32:14,989
- That’s his bread and butter, doctor.
- Send him to my house.

1418
01:32:15,072 --> 01:32:16,531
I’ll feed him bread and butter.

1419
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,322
It’s no big deal. Let’s hire him.
- Yes!

1420
01:32:19,489 --> 01:32:21,906
You’re always giving some excuse
whenever I want to see him.

1421
01:32:22,156 --> 01:32:23,364
You don’t want him here, huh?

1422
01:32:23,447 --> 01:32:25,197
- What’s your problem?
- What’s your problem?

1423
01:32:25,364 --> 01:32:27,864
- I don’t have any problem.
- Then call him.

1424
01:32:28,406 --> 01:32:29,947
Battery is low. I will...

1425
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:32,114
- Give me his number. I’ll call him.
- I will only call him.

1426
01:32:35,614 --> 01:32:38,406
Hello... Why are you stepping out?

1427
01:32:39,864 --> 01:32:41,281
Because the signals are better there.

1428
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:43,614
Make the call quickly and my life
will be better.

1429
01:32:43,739 --> 01:32:44,739
Please.

1430
01:32:44,906 --> 01:32:46,114
You must be really lucky.

1431
01:32:46,822 --> 01:32:48,489
Yesterday you told me.
Today they are only inviting you.

1432
01:32:49,406 --> 01:32:51,156
Every fool has his day.

1433
01:32:51,364 --> 01:32:52,614
Today is your day.

1434
01:32:52,947 --> 01:32:55,489
Just because they invited you,
doesn’t mean I’ll let you come.

1435
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:01,531
I’ll give them some lame excuse
to keep you away.

1436
01:33:02,281 --> 01:33:04,197
The doctor will call me as soon as
you hang up.

1437
01:33:07,156 --> 01:33:08,697
How do you know there’s a doctor inside?

1438
01:33:09,072 --> 01:33:10,447
Where are you?

1439
01:33:10,739 --> 01:33:12,781
Stop limping and look up.

1440
01:33:22,531 --> 01:33:24,364
Hey! What’s with the doctor?

1441
01:33:24,822 --> 01:33:26,197
He hated you last time.

1442
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:30,739
But now, he’s acting like some
die-hard fan of yours.

1443
01:33:30,781 --> 01:33:31,906
Relax!

1444
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,406
It’s an obvious reaction for someone
who had his son kidnapped.

1445
01:33:34,947 --> 01:33:36,322
You kidnapped his son?!

1446
01:33:36,656 --> 01:33:37,739
It's him.

1447
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:40,489
This fatso?!

1448
01:33:42,781 --> 01:33:43,739
Is he coming?

1449
01:33:43,822 --> 01:33:44,864
Yes, sir.

1450
01:33:45,031 --> 01:33:47,281
Bah! This doctor is killing me.

1451
01:33:47,781 --> 01:33:48,906
Please come.

1452
01:33:56,531 --> 01:33:59,697
“In a far off city named Vaikunthapuram”

1453
01:33:59,739 --> 01:34:04,947
“Further away from the humongous palace”

1454
01:34:05,156 --> 01:34:14,489
“At the shore of a sea filled with nectar
There was a dais shining like the moon”

1455
01:34:14,864 --> 01:34:22,906
“Lord Vishnu was seated with Goddess Laxmi
on a throne adorned with black lotuses"

1456
01:34:23,281 --> 01:34:35,614
“Being the holy saviour, he rushes to
the rescue of the helpless Gajendra"

1457
01:34:55,947 --> 01:35:00,364
“Here sets foot a new relationship
in the abode of Vaikunthapuram”

1458
01:35:00,697 --> 01:35:05,364
“Here comes the epitome of joy
to a place weeping with sadness”

1459
01:35:14,947 --> 01:35:19,489
“Here forms a new acquaintance
in the abode of Vaikunthapuram”

1460
01:35:19,656 --> 01:35:24,197
“Here he brings happiness to
people flooding with tears”

1461
01:35:24,322 --> 01:35:29,072
“Here holds an umbrella the
sky for the cloud arriving”

1462
01:35:29,197 --> 01:35:33,781
“Here sighs with relief the world
for he will be a pillar of support”

1463
01:35:33,822 --> 01:35:37,739
“Here welcomes the ravishing
sun as the holy vermillion”

1464
01:35:37,822 --> 01:35:39,697
“In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...”

1465
01:35:42,489 --> 01:35:44,489
“In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...”

1466
01:35:47,197 --> 01:35:49,364
“In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...”

1467
01:35:51,906 --> 01:35:54,197
“In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...”

1468
01:35:57,739 --> 01:35:59,822
Hey! Why did you give her money?

1469
01:36:30,197 --> 01:36:30,989
Sir.

1470
01:36:32,156 --> 01:36:33,031
My son.

1471
01:36:34,447 --> 01:36:36,072
And my son?
- Relax.

1472
01:36:36,281 --> 01:36:37,656
I can't.
- He’s at tea bunk.

1473
01:36:37,864 --> 01:36:38,947
I’ll be there in a second.

1474
01:36:39,822 --> 01:36:41,489
- I didn’t pay for the tea.
- I will.

1475
01:36:42,572 --> 01:36:43,739
He has my headphones.

1476
01:36:43,822 --> 01:36:45,281
I’ll get you new headphones.

1477
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:47,947
You guys are criminals for kidnapping kids.

1478
01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:52,781
Your father has been hiding you
like a bride.

1479
01:36:54,864 --> 01:36:56,531
I never got to take a good look at you.

1480
01:36:56,822 --> 01:36:57,739
Come forward.

1481
01:37:17,906 --> 01:37:18,864
He’s good.

1482
01:37:22,281 --> 01:37:23,447
You’re a tough man.

1483
01:37:25,031 --> 01:37:27,156
You didn’t just carry my son-in-law
the other day.

1484
01:37:29,156 --> 01:37:35,781
You carried the prestige of this house,
ARK Company and our hopes.

1485
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:41,114
You work for my granddaughter, right?

1486
01:37:41,364 --> 01:37:42,406
Yes, sir.

1487
01:37:42,697 --> 01:37:44,572
- Is she paying you well?
- Yes, sir.

1488
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:45,489
How much?

1489
01:37:45,656 --> 01:37:50,322
I was promised 25K…
I get 20K after all the exclusions.

1490
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,281
- I’ll pay you 50K. Come work for me.
- Sir!

1491
01:37:52,364 --> 01:37:55,697
Sir! He’ll be spoiled if you promise him
so much money.

1492
01:37:56,031 --> 01:37:57,322
What are you talking?

1493
01:37:57,614 --> 01:37:59,156
You’ll be spoiling him
if you gave him money.

1494
01:37:59,322 --> 01:38:00,614
But we will be encouraging him.

1495
01:38:00,739 --> 01:38:01,489
No, sir...

1496
01:38:01,739 --> 01:38:03,114
- Work for me.
- Sure, sir.

1497
01:38:03,989 --> 01:38:07,531
Choose any room you like
and find a desk and a computer.

1498
01:38:07,697 --> 01:38:08,489
Okay, sir.

1499
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:11,197
- But what would I do?
- Exactly my question.

1500
01:38:12,072 --> 01:38:14,156
He will watch pictures of girls
on the Internet.

1501
01:38:17,531 --> 01:38:20,281
We can think about that later.

1502
01:38:20,364 --> 01:38:21,489
Sure, sir.

1503
01:38:22,781 --> 01:38:26,447
I have a lot of people to meet
and loads of work to do.

1504
01:38:26,697 --> 01:38:27,739
Time for you to leave.

1505
01:38:28,072 --> 01:38:29,114
Go!

1506
01:38:29,156 --> 01:38:30,197
Idiot.

1507
01:38:30,572 --> 01:38:32,489
You need to be straightforward
in everything you do.

1508
01:38:32,614 --> 01:38:34,406
I hate people who lie.

1509
01:38:34,656 --> 01:38:35,614
What?

1510
01:38:37,531 --> 01:38:41,406
You just proved that you could insist
on something you don’t do.

1511
01:38:42,197 --> 01:38:45,031
You’re an inspiration
to set of people, sir.

1512
01:38:46,197 --> 01:38:48,406
Inspiration to others like me?

1513
01:38:48,739 --> 01:38:49,489
Hello?

1514
01:38:49,656 --> 01:38:51,072
Hey, ma’am! How are you doing?

1515
01:38:51,531 --> 01:38:52,781
Didn’t you recognize me?

1516
01:38:52,906 --> 01:38:54,197
Come. Sit. Sit.

1517
01:38:54,447 --> 01:38:57,239
I was at the hotel for madam’s engagement,
remember?

1518
01:38:57,739 --> 01:38:59,156
Hi! How are you?

1519
01:39:00,364 --> 01:39:01,322
All okay?

1520
01:39:01,489 --> 01:39:05,656
Never mind, ma’am.
I know you don’t remember me.

1521
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:08,697
- Sorry. Bad memory.
- I don’t mind.

1522
01:39:08,906 --> 01:39:11,197
Hero Chiranjeevi waves at his fans.

1523
01:39:11,656 --> 01:39:13,739
Doesn’t mean he knows all their names.

1524
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:14,906
Same goes for you.

1525
01:39:15,031 --> 01:39:17,864
You’re like a star.
And I’m like your biggest fan.

1526
01:39:18,489 --> 01:39:19,489
God!

1527
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:23,614
See? Even I have a good following.

1528
01:39:25,364 --> 01:39:26,572
Oh... Hello.

1529
01:39:28,489 --> 01:39:29,364
Of course.

1530
01:39:29,531 --> 01:39:33,406
To be honest... You might look
above average but you’re super sexy.

1531
01:39:33,531 --> 01:39:34,489
- Really?
- Promise.

1532
01:39:34,614 --> 01:39:37,572
- Such a naughty boy you are!
- Don’t hit your fans.

1533
01:39:40,989 --> 01:39:41,947
Bro, come here.

1534
01:39:42,072 --> 01:39:43,239
Tell me, bro.

1535
01:39:43,322 --> 01:39:45,031
Just look at her… She’s super hot.

1536
01:39:45,156 --> 01:39:46,989
I can't make those comments.
Tell me what this is about.

1537
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:50,739
Let me know who her
close relatives are here.

1538
01:39:50,822 --> 01:39:51,947
I want to be friends with them.

1539
01:39:52,031 --> 01:39:53,156
- Not possible.
- Why?

1540
01:39:53,281 --> 01:39:54,572
I’m her uncle.

1541
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:55,989
Sorry, sir.

1542
01:39:56,156 --> 01:39:58,114
Going by your clothes,
I thought you were the maid.

1543
01:39:58,489 --> 01:39:59,447
What do you mean?

1544
01:39:59,989 --> 01:40:01,989
You want me to suit up at home as well?

1545
01:40:03,656 --> 01:40:04,781
How do you like the house?

1546
01:40:05,031 --> 01:40:06,406
It’s wonderful, sir.

1547
01:40:06,781 --> 01:40:10,239
But I don’t like that fact that he was
attacked despite having all of you around.

1548
01:40:10,864 --> 01:40:12,697
Why didn’t you file a police complaint?

1549
01:40:13,072 --> 01:40:14,447
We did, man.

1550
01:40:15,947 --> 01:40:17,781
- We did file a complaint.
- You can be informal with me.

1551
01:40:17,864 --> 01:40:19,447
You’re elder to me.

1552
01:40:20,989 --> 01:40:22,947
The guy we’re dealing with is quite
powerful as well.

1553
01:40:23,406 --> 01:40:25,031
We don’t have enough evidence
to support the case.

1554
01:40:25,531 --> 01:40:29,572
So the police are afraid to arrest him.

1555
01:40:29,989 --> 01:40:32,114
Why is that stopping us?
We'll go and talk to him.

1556
01:40:33,572 --> 01:40:35,156
- Shall we?
- Yeah!

1557
01:40:45,061 --> 01:40:46,061
Sir!

1558
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:12,437
Who are you?

1559
01:41:12,728 --> 01:41:14,603
This is too much, Paidithalli.

1560
01:41:15,562 --> 01:41:17,895
You want shares in his company.
You want be the director of his company...

1561
01:41:18,062 --> 01:41:19,187
You also want his position
if you can have it.

1562
01:41:19,228 --> 01:41:20,687
But you don’t know him.

1563
01:41:21,728 --> 01:41:25,270
He’s the Founder! ARK!

1564
01:41:26,812 --> 01:41:28,312
Who let you in?

1565
01:41:28,437 --> 01:41:29,812
It was very hard to come here...

1566
01:41:29,937 --> 01:41:32,395
We took flight till Rajahmundry
and in a car till Kakinada.

1567
01:41:32,437 --> 01:41:33,728
After reaching this place…

1568
01:41:34,395 --> 01:41:35,687
It was uncomfortable.

1569
01:41:41,687 --> 01:41:44,395
Sir, you can’t go in.

1570
01:41:50,312 --> 01:41:51,853
Let’s go. Start the vehicle.

1571
01:41:52,395 --> 01:41:54,978
No, sir. We travelled so far.

1572
01:42:01,937 --> 01:42:03,353
Same feeling.

1573
01:42:03,937 --> 01:42:05,895
That hand print…

1574
01:42:06,603 --> 01:42:08,603
Who pushed him?

1575
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:17,062
My nephew visited your office and
you asked him to get out in a video call.

1576
01:42:17,603 --> 01:42:19,853
But you expect grand welcome from us?

1577
01:42:20,853 --> 01:42:22,395
Impossible!

1578
01:42:23,103 --> 01:42:25,145
My load is in there.
- So what?

1579
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,562
I giving you 25 to 30 crores business
every year.

1580
01:42:29,645 --> 01:42:30,603
So what?

1581
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:32,603
Hey! I need to go inside.

1582
01:42:38,145 --> 01:42:42,103
Don’t you get it, old man?

1583
01:43:05,603 --> 01:43:07,187
Lift the load. Come on.

1584
01:43:10,937 --> 01:43:12,228
Who pushed him?

1585
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:14,687
Who the hell do you think you are,
barging into our port?

1586
01:43:26,395 --> 01:43:28,395
Who pushed him?

1587
01:43:32,687 --> 01:43:34,520
Who raised his hand on him?

1588
01:43:35,978 --> 01:43:37,603
Was it you?

1589
01:43:38,228 --> 01:43:39,437
You pushed him?

1590
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:41,228
- Tell me.
- No…

1591
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,728
I didn’t push him.

1592
01:43:42,853 --> 01:43:44,020
Did you push him?

1593
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:47,270
Tell me!

1594
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,562
How dare you guys push him.

1595
01:43:51,937 --> 01:43:53,895
Pick up the stuff that old man dropped.

1596
01:44:21,103 --> 01:44:22,895
Elaichi tea, sir. Especially for you.

1597
01:44:23,103 --> 01:44:24,687
Towel sprayed with cologne, sir.
It will cool you down.

1598
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,645
Who was it?

1599
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:27,187
Who pushed him?

1600
01:44:27,353 --> 01:44:30,187
Bah! You’ve been asking the same
question since you came.

1601
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:32,187
You seriously don’t think a bunch
of people pushed him, do you?

1602
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:34,062
Only one guy pushed him and
you hit him long back.

1603
01:44:34,145 --> 01:44:35,395
He’s there.

1604
01:44:41,853 --> 01:44:42,812
Where’s your boss?

1605
01:44:42,978 --> 01:44:46,103
We need to yell his name out and call him.
If you spare us the time that is.

1606
01:44:46,562 --> 01:44:47,603
Sir!!!

1607
01:44:49,187 --> 01:44:50,937
It can’t get any clearer than this.

1608
01:44:51,145 --> 01:44:52,770
What sir is trying to say is…

1609
01:44:53,062 --> 01:44:54,395
Your father stabbed his son-in-law.

1610
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,312
But there was no evidence.
Case is hanging by a weak link now.

1611
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,228
I came and hit you guys.
And there’s no evidence here as well.

1612
01:44:58,353 --> 01:45:00,145
This case will also be weak.

1613
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:02,270
Let’s not play this game of tit for tat.

1614
01:45:02,645 --> 01:45:05,687
Let’s sit down and talk it out.

1615
01:45:05,853 --> 01:45:08,312
Sir strongly feels we shouldn’t
resort to violence.

1616
01:45:08,603 --> 01:45:09,603
What do you think?

1617
01:45:09,853 --> 01:45:11,353
What are you looking at?
Get up!

1618
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,478
You were quick on your feet a while ago.
Now you’re looking sloppy.

1619
01:45:13,603 --> 01:45:16,395
We’ll be late for our flight. Let’s go.
Brother, you have anything else to ask?

1620
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:19,603
Oh!!

1621
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:21,270
This is sad!

1622
01:45:21,562 --> 01:45:23,645
Our Prince won't talk...

1623
01:45:24,103 --> 01:45:26,103
This Prince has nothing to say.

1624
01:45:26,478 --> 01:45:27,395
Both of you are unique.

1625
01:45:27,687 --> 01:45:29,478
Silent movie superstars.

1626
01:45:33,395 --> 01:45:34,978
What is that?

1627
01:45:35,562 --> 01:45:38,687
Isn’t this boat supposed to be on water?

1628
01:45:38,895 --> 01:45:41,020
- It’s a car, man.
- I know that.

1629
01:45:41,395 --> 01:45:42,812
I was wondering what its name is.

1630
01:45:43,437 --> 01:45:46,853
RR?! Sounds like a Rajamouli film title.

1631
01:45:47,728 --> 01:45:49,103
Rolls Royce.

1632
01:45:51,937 --> 01:45:55,312
Wow! Amazing contrast, boss!

1633
01:45:55,978 --> 01:45:58,978
The car’s classy look doesn’t go
with your appeal at all.

1634
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:00,437
Let’s take a selfie.

1635
01:46:01,437 --> 01:46:02,603
Umm…

1636
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,270
Nice umbrella.

1637
01:46:08,687 --> 01:46:11,312
I’ve seen people use it
when it’s sunny or raining.

1638
01:46:11,853 --> 01:46:14,103
But this is the first time,
I saw someone use it to stab.

1639
01:46:15,603 --> 01:46:18,270
I can’t stab artistically like you.

1640
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:20,687
I’m rough like that.

1641
01:46:26,103 --> 01:46:27,478
You just got down the car.

1642
01:46:28,187 --> 01:46:29,895
I just got into my character.

1643
01:46:31,853 --> 01:46:32,937
Don’t be shy.

1644
01:46:33,937 --> 01:46:34,978
I’ll see you around.

1645
01:46:35,603 --> 01:46:36,978
Nice meeting you.

1646
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:42,728
Come. We’ll be late for our flight.

1647
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:46,395
But I have to admit, boss…

1648
01:46:46,562 --> 01:46:47,895
It’s a great car.

1649
01:46:50,228 --> 01:46:51,437
Hey, wait!

1650
01:46:53,062 --> 01:46:55,478
He warned you in our port...

1651
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:57,145
I'll kill him.

1652
01:46:59,603 --> 01:47:03,312
They will give us their company shares
very soon.

1653
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,937
Where will they go?

1654
01:47:06,062 --> 01:47:06,812
Go.

1655
01:47:08,062 --> 01:47:09,187
Go.

1656
01:47:14,812 --> 01:47:18,895
Don’t ask silly questions like where
and how he got stabbed.

1657
01:47:19,062 --> 01:47:21,312
They’re not middle class like us.
They belong to the elite.

1658
01:47:21,562 --> 01:47:23,103
Ammu!

1659
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,770
You’re wearing a cute skirt after so long.

1660
01:47:26,853 --> 01:47:27,770
Dear…

1661
01:47:28,437 --> 01:47:29,145
Pops.

1662
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:32,353
- Who is he?
- Bantu! My Secretary.

1663
01:47:32,437 --> 01:47:33,353
Hello!

1664
01:47:33,645 --> 01:47:35,437
Then why is he getting all touchy?

1665
01:47:36,437 --> 01:47:37,353
Key…

1666
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,853
Key… Car…

1667
01:47:39,312 --> 01:47:41,020
You didn’t tell him?

1668
01:47:41,145 --> 01:47:42,437
What does she have to tell me?

1669
01:47:42,603 --> 01:47:44,937
Your daughter is not so interested
in the groom. - Bantu!

1670
01:47:45,312 --> 01:47:46,103
So?

1671
01:47:46,187 --> 01:47:49,062
So, we took things a little too far.

1672
01:47:49,562 --> 01:47:52,437
Oh, that was pretty shocking.
Don’t tell them anything now.

1673
01:47:52,687 --> 01:47:54,270
That is why we didn't tell you, pops.

1674
01:47:54,645 --> 01:47:56,020
Why is he calling me pops?

1675
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:59,020
Ammu’s pops is my pops. Right, pops?

1676
01:47:59,228 --> 01:48:00,895
Ammu! Come fast!

1677
01:48:01,103 --> 01:48:02,937
- For now?
- If possible, forever.

1678
01:48:03,062 --> 01:48:04,728
- Come on!
- Relax.

1679
01:48:05,978 --> 01:48:07,478
Ammu.

1680
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,687
Sir…

1681
01:48:15,228 --> 01:48:16,937
Hello, sir… How are you?

1682
01:48:17,728 --> 01:48:20,812
- This is Jubilee Hills Road no. 36, right?
- Yes, sir.

1683
01:48:20,978 --> 01:48:23,395
- What are you doing here then?
- I work here.

1684
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,478
What’s the job?

1685
01:48:24,645 --> 01:48:26,520
They still didn't give me any designation.

1686
01:48:26,645 --> 01:48:28,562
For now I’m browsing pictures of girls
on the internet.

1687
01:48:28,895 --> 01:48:30,145
What brings you here?

1688
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:31,812
I’m here to meet Mr. Ramachandra.

1689
01:48:31,978 --> 01:48:34,103
Whatever it is, you can tell me, sir.

1690
01:48:34,437 --> 01:48:36,062
I can’t discuss it with a kid.

1691
01:48:36,187 --> 01:48:39,312
Commissioner wanted me to ask
if Mr. Ramachandra needs security.

1692
01:48:39,853 --> 01:48:41,478
He doesn’t need security
while I’m around, sir.

1693
01:48:41,645 --> 01:48:43,812
Listen… I’m like a one-man army.

1694
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:46,978
Who the hell are you to make decisions
about his security?

1695
01:48:47,895 --> 01:48:48,770
Come close.

1696
01:48:48,978 --> 01:48:49,812
What?

1697
01:48:50,228 --> 01:48:51,645
Actually...

1698
01:48:51,978 --> 01:48:54,187
I am Mr. Ramachandra’s real son.

1699
01:49:02,103 --> 01:49:03,812
It’s true, sir. I’m Mr. Ramachandra’s son.

1700
01:49:03,937 --> 01:49:05,145
I swear on you!

1701
01:49:05,603 --> 01:49:07,187
- Hello, officer.
- Hello.

1702
01:49:08,937 --> 01:49:10,020
What about him?

1703
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,812
They’ve been assuming he’s their son
for 25 years.

1704
01:49:13,062 --> 01:49:14,270
- Since 25 years?
- Hmm.

1705
01:49:14,395 --> 01:49:16,103
- When did you find out?
- Recently.

1706
01:49:16,187 --> 01:49:17,937
- Who told you?
- A nurse told me.

1707
01:49:17,978 --> 01:49:20,395
Nurse and that guy
hiding behind the pillar…

1708
01:49:21,937 --> 01:49:24,812
They replaced him with me,
putting me into a middle class family.

1709
01:49:24,937 --> 01:49:27,103
And replaced me with him,
making him heir to a rich family.

1710
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:29,687
- Who told you?
- No, Nurse told me.

1711
01:49:29,895 --> 01:49:31,895
- When did she tell you?
- Recently.

1712
01:49:32,062 --> 01:49:35,187
- Why didn’t she tell you 25 years ago?
- Because she was in a coma.

1713
01:49:35,353 --> 01:49:38,062
- Why did she tell you now?
- Because she came out of the coma.

1714
01:49:38,437 --> 01:49:40,645
- Did she tell you and you only?
- Why would she tell everyone in the world?

1715
01:49:40,728 --> 01:49:42,437
She should have told
Mr. Ramachandra at least.

1716
01:49:42,562 --> 01:49:44,145
- She was about to tell him.
- Then why didn’t she tell him?

1717
01:49:44,228 --> 01:49:45,812
Because she died before
she could tell him.

1718
01:49:50,103 --> 01:49:51,270
Do you want some tea?

1719
01:49:51,645 --> 01:49:53,853
No... I need whiskey.

1720
01:49:54,353 --> 01:49:55,770
I'll drink in the evening
after my working hours.

1721
01:49:55,895 --> 01:49:56,853
Okay.

1722
01:49:57,937 --> 01:49:59,353
Bantu…

1723
01:49:59,687 --> 01:50:02,603
Does anyone else know about this
apart from you?

1724
01:50:02,937 --> 01:50:04,062
No one knows, sir.

1725
01:50:04,395 --> 01:50:05,520
I won’t tell anyone either.

1726
01:50:07,645 --> 01:50:08,770
I’ll sacrifice.

1727
01:50:08,937 --> 01:50:12,187
If you’re so sacrificing,
why did you come to this house?

1728
01:50:14,687 --> 01:50:15,895
Who else will look after my house, sir?

1729
01:50:16,395 --> 01:50:17,895
Bantu… Keys.

1730
01:50:17,937 --> 01:50:20,145
Reddy will kill me.
I need to go to the office urgently.

1731
01:50:20,728 --> 01:50:22,187
I’ll see you in the evening.

1732
01:50:22,312 --> 01:50:24,478
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1733
01:50:26,645 --> 01:50:27,853
What is she doing here?

1734
01:50:28,978 --> 01:50:30,353
His fiancé.

1735
01:50:32,187 --> 01:50:33,478
Why is she kissing you then?

1736
01:50:33,562 --> 01:50:34,770
Because we are in love.

1737
01:50:34,937 --> 01:50:36,895
- Does he know?
- Come on, sir!

1738
01:50:36,978 --> 01:50:38,520
Why would he marry her if he knew?

1739
01:50:38,728 --> 01:50:40,353
Does Ramachandra know this at least?

1740
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,812
We were going to tell him
and something terrible happened.

1741
01:50:43,353 --> 01:50:44,103
Oi!

1742
01:50:44,603 --> 01:50:46,645
Naughty boy, huh!

1743
01:50:49,687 --> 01:50:50,687
Who is she?

1744
01:50:51,228 --> 01:50:52,562
His nephew.

1745
01:50:52,812 --> 01:50:55,020
- Why is she spanking you?
- I don't know...

1746
01:50:55,145 --> 01:50:57,062
She’s been flirting with me
ever since I joined here.

1747
01:50:57,228 --> 01:50:59,062
Now she is spanking me.

1748
01:50:59,187 --> 01:51:00,103
Nice!

1749
01:51:00,395 --> 01:51:02,520
You flirt with all the girls in this house.

1750
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:04,937
And he doesn't care about it.

1751
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,187
I can’t see this anymore.

1752
01:51:08,395 --> 01:51:09,520
I’ll leave.

1753
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:12,520
Morning officer.

1754
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:13,812
- Bantu…
- Sir…

1755
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:19,645
Sir, do you run a background check
on the employees you are hiring?

1756
01:51:19,937 --> 01:51:20,770
We do check.

1757
01:51:21,187 --> 01:51:22,853
Then why did you hire him?

1758
01:51:23,437 --> 01:51:24,770
What are you talking about?

1759
01:51:25,312 --> 01:51:30,812
If there’s anyone in this house with
the common sense and intelligence I do…

1760
01:51:30,937 --> 01:51:31,770
It’s him.

1761
01:51:34,812 --> 01:51:36,062
Very nice!

1762
01:51:38,895 --> 01:51:41,270
- Oh man! I’m done with you.
- See you again.

1763
01:51:42,103 --> 01:51:43,395
How did it go, sir?

1764
01:51:43,812 --> 01:51:45,187
It was horrifying.

1765
01:51:45,687 --> 01:51:49,312
We assume all rich people are intelligent.

1766
01:51:49,937 --> 01:51:51,562
But they’re just lucky.

1767
01:51:52,645 --> 01:51:53,770
Good morning, sir.

1768
01:51:54,728 --> 01:51:56,562
Hi, morning… Come.

1769
01:51:57,645 --> 01:51:59,978
After you joined here
we didn't speak properly.

1770
01:52:00,853 --> 01:52:01,770
They said you went out.

1771
01:52:02,228 --> 01:52:03,770
I was talking to the SP, sir.

1772
01:52:04,062 --> 01:52:07,520
It’s about the attack. He was asking
if you need security.

1773
01:52:07,645 --> 01:52:09,187
I told them you don’t need any security.

1774
01:52:09,812 --> 01:52:11,062
Security?

1775
01:52:12,895 --> 01:52:15,437
We close our doors
when there is heavy breeze.

1776
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:18,895
But what can we do
if the storm is in our home.

1777
01:52:19,145 --> 01:52:20,645
We have to accept it.

1778
01:52:22,437 --> 01:52:24,228
When we are tough situations,

1779
01:52:24,895 --> 01:52:27,770
we look to our family for strength.

1780
01:52:29,228 --> 01:52:31,270
But when that family is your weakness...

1781
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,645
who do you look to?

1782
01:52:34,145 --> 01:52:37,937
Bantu, even God needs an offering.

1783
01:52:38,603 --> 01:52:40,728
Even a King needs protection.

1784
01:52:42,228 --> 01:52:46,228
I don't want to tell him my problems
and worry him.

1785
01:52:47,812 --> 01:52:50,353
My son won’t understand even if I told him.

1786
01:52:51,478 --> 01:52:54,145
There’s no point in telling them.

1787
01:52:55,603 --> 01:52:57,937
And if I want to say something to my…

1788
01:53:05,645 --> 01:53:08,562
All the greatest battles are with
the closest people.

1789
01:53:09,353 --> 01:53:12,312
The greatest battles are fought
with the closest people.

1790
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,437
Bantu…

1791
01:53:17,478 --> 01:53:18,520
What did my son-in-law say?

1792
01:53:18,770 --> 01:53:20,228
He said a lot.

1793
01:53:21,603 --> 01:53:23,937
Is he upset about the differences
with my daughter?

1794
01:53:25,478 --> 01:53:26,978
Of course he would be.

1795
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:29,395
It’s been 7 years since they had
a proper conversation.

1796
01:53:30,353 --> 01:53:32,312
Did he tell you anything else?

1797
01:53:33,187 --> 01:53:34,353
He didn’t tell me anything, sir.

1798
01:53:34,728 --> 01:53:36,562
But you just did.
- Oh no!

1799
01:53:36,895 --> 01:53:39,062
You can’t hold anything in even
after all these years, huh?

1800
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:40,228
What?

1801
01:53:40,895 --> 01:53:42,978
I won’t live for another 100 years
to be patient.

1802
01:53:43,603 --> 01:53:45,103
I need to know everything immediately.

1803
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:47,270
- Okay.
- So what did he say?

1804
01:53:47,937 --> 01:53:50,645
- He said something about his son.
- Is he feeling bad?

1805
01:53:51,145 --> 01:53:52,103
Hmm.

1806
01:53:53,728 --> 01:53:55,062
He is a strange guy.

1807
01:53:55,395 --> 01:53:57,395
Sit, sit.

1808
01:53:58,270 --> 01:54:00,270
No one knows what’s in his heart.

1809
01:54:00,978 --> 01:54:04,187
I want see him burst out in anger,
I’ll die a happy man.

1810
01:54:05,645 --> 01:54:07,978
I'll help you!
You don’t need to die for it.

1811
01:54:10,562 --> 01:54:12,145
Just because they are close with you...

1812
01:54:12,395 --> 01:54:14,937
You don't work at home.
You don't go to office.

1813
01:54:15,312 --> 01:54:16,895
Just sitting outside and smoking.

1814
01:54:17,228 --> 01:54:19,853
They are very innocent.
This is wrong.

1815
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:22,228
I am the owner! My wish!

1816
01:54:23,687 --> 01:54:26,603
- Get out! Get out!
- Rowdy.

1817
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,062
Relax.

1818
01:54:29,395 --> 01:54:30,937
He’s got something, man.

1819
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:33,645
Grandpa is giving him way
too much lenience.

1820
01:54:33,895 --> 01:54:35,853
Ramachandra treats him
like a family member.

1821
01:54:36,353 --> 01:54:37,937
We should be friends with him.

1822
01:54:38,103 --> 01:54:39,937
Why do you want to mess things up?

1823
01:54:40,353 --> 01:54:42,978
1.5 lakhs expenditure everyday?

1824
01:54:48,812 --> 01:54:50,562
We’re discussing accounts here and
why are you hitting them?

1825
01:54:50,687 --> 01:54:52,062
Because they hit me.

1826
01:54:52,187 --> 01:54:54,603
- Why did they hit you?
- Because they stole one lakh.

1827
01:54:55,437 --> 01:54:56,437
Why did they hit you only?

1828
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,353
Because they gave me share.

1829
01:54:59,978 --> 01:55:01,103
Give me that stick.

1830
01:55:01,353 --> 01:55:02,562
For what?

1831
01:55:02,728 --> 01:55:05,187
Because I have to hit them.

1832
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:07,062
Uncle! Uncle! No!

1833
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:11,478
You don’t worry.
I’ll go get sister.

1834
01:55:12,603 --> 01:55:14,062
What’s going on, Sita?
What happened?

1835
01:55:14,187 --> 01:55:16,562
Stop running and let him hit you...
he will be satisfied.

1836
01:55:16,728 --> 01:55:18,937
Yasu, uncle is beating me
just because he said.

1837
01:55:18,978 --> 01:55:21,020
What’s wrong, dad?
Why are you hitting him?

1838
01:55:21,228 --> 01:55:23,145
After finding out how much money
he’s looting every day…

1839
01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:25,478
What did you expect from me?

1840
01:55:26,062 --> 01:55:27,187
Who told you?

1841
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:28,020
He told me.

1842
01:55:28,187 --> 01:55:29,770
How do you know if its true?

1843
01:55:29,978 --> 01:55:31,395
He will tell me only if it’s true.

1844
01:55:32,562 --> 01:55:33,353
Oh, really?

1845
01:55:34,145 --> 01:55:35,562
You speak only the truth, huh?

1846
01:55:36,062 --> 01:55:36,853
Tell me.

1847
01:55:39,062 --> 01:55:41,062
Why will he loot our money?

1848
01:55:41,437 --> 01:55:43,687
We are paying him 10 lakhs salary
every month.

1849
01:55:44,645 --> 01:55:46,895
He bets a million rupees on a poker table.

1850
01:55:47,187 --> 01:55:48,103
He’s a big player.

1851
01:55:48,312 --> 01:55:49,978
Dad, you gamble?

1852
01:55:50,895 --> 01:55:53,520
Only on the weekends.

1853
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:55,312
That’s it. Yeah.

1854
01:55:55,853 --> 01:55:58,020
He talks to Priya on the weekdays.

1855
01:55:59,478 --> 01:56:01,478
- Who’s Priya?
- How would I know?

1856
01:56:01,645 --> 01:56:03,228
Not everything you say is true.

1857
01:56:03,353 --> 01:56:05,978
You have a message from Priya in the mobile
you threw on the floor.

1858
01:56:07,812 --> 01:56:09,228
It read ‘Call me when free’.

1859
01:56:10,978 --> 01:56:12,812
What’s the big deal?
She just asked me to call back.

1860
01:56:12,895 --> 01:56:16,103
There is no controversy here.
- Actually, she called you baby in the end.

1861
01:56:18,353 --> 01:56:19,228
Baby?!

1862
01:56:19,395 --> 01:56:22,103
She also sent a heart emoticon. In red.

1863
01:56:23,312 --> 01:56:25,145
Don’t look, sir. Her pictures are on it.

1864
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:26,687
- Really?
- Private.

1865
01:56:26,937 --> 01:56:29,853
This is quite common nowadays.

1866
01:56:29,978 --> 01:56:31,728
I don’t get why these people
are over reacting.

1867
01:56:33,895 --> 01:56:35,145
Why are you hitting me
when it’s his fault?

1868
01:56:35,228 --> 01:56:36,520
Where were you when all this
was happening?

1869
01:56:36,728 --> 01:56:38,520
What do you expect me to do?
Find a girl for myself?

1870
01:56:38,687 --> 01:56:41,812
- Please!
- Hey! When will you women change?

1871
01:56:42,145 --> 01:56:44,187
You hit your brothers just because
you can't slap your husbands.

1872
01:56:44,353 --> 01:56:46,062
They’re outdated.
They will never change.

1873
01:56:46,478 --> 01:56:51,145
Why is he running away
if Bantu wasn’t telling the truth?

1874
01:56:52,062 --> 01:56:54,395
Alright then. I’ll hear you out.

1875
01:56:54,687 --> 01:56:55,895
Tell about me.

1876
01:56:56,228 --> 01:56:57,687
Isn’t that be too much for the day?

1877
01:56:58,187 --> 01:56:59,103
You come with me.

1878
01:56:59,312 --> 01:57:00,270
Father!

1879
01:57:02,353 --> 01:57:03,437
You tell me.

1880
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:10,770
You don’t get along with your husband.

1881
01:57:13,603 --> 01:57:15,520
Bantu! Come with me.

1882
01:57:15,603 --> 01:57:16,562
Dad!

1883
01:57:17,395 --> 01:57:18,478
How do you know?

1884
01:57:18,603 --> 01:57:20,728
You shut your room door the first time
I was here.

1885
01:57:22,145 --> 01:57:23,353
I knew it right away.

1886
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,937
Wife and husband go through
a lot of stuff.

1887
01:57:28,228 --> 01:57:30,353
They will shut and open doors
as they please.

1888
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,520
If a newlywed couple close the door…

1889
01:57:33,687 --> 01:57:35,645
It means they have something
personal to talk about.

1890
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:38,812
But if they still shut the door
after 25 years…

1891
01:57:40,437 --> 01:57:43,478
It means they don’t want the world
to know they’re not on talking terms.

1892
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:48,270
He comes home at 6 pm dot,
no matter how busy he is.

1893
01:57:48,978 --> 01:57:52,395
So he’s implying that his life revolves
around family and work only.

1894
01:57:53,062 --> 01:57:55,520
And when a man is trying so hard, it means…

1895
01:57:56,562 --> 01:57:58,395
He definitely did something wrong
in the past.

1896
01:57:58,645 --> 01:57:59,937
What do you think that is?

1897
01:58:04,770 --> 01:58:05,687
Revati.

1898
01:58:12,770 --> 01:58:15,187
She was his Secretary 7 years ago.

1899
01:58:15,603 --> 01:58:17,353
She resigned only after a month’s duty.

1900
01:58:19,603 --> 01:58:21,062
Back then…

1901
01:58:25,228 --> 01:58:27,020
The sad part is everyone knew about this.

1902
01:58:27,937 --> 01:58:29,937
But everyone pretends like it’s nothing.

1903
01:58:31,645 --> 01:58:33,020
Including your father.

1904
01:58:40,228 --> 01:58:43,187
You think telling the
truth makes you great?

1905
01:58:44,187 --> 01:58:45,978
When kids don't eat food...

1906
01:58:46,478 --> 01:58:49,020
Their mother will tell them a scary story.

1907
01:58:49,437 --> 01:58:50,687
Is that wrong on her part?

1908
01:58:51,145 --> 01:58:52,812
Try and love someone.

1909
01:58:53,812 --> 01:58:55,812
You will know what a lie is worth.

1910
01:58:57,187 --> 01:59:00,478
That mother also tells her grown up kid
that he’ll fall sick if he doesn’t eat.

1911
01:59:01,812 --> 01:59:03,312
She won't lie to him.

1912
01:59:04,562 --> 01:59:07,103
You’ll know what a lie is worth
when you love someone. I get it.

1913
01:59:07,353 --> 01:59:10,853
But you’ll know how strong you love is,
only when you tell the truth.

1914
01:59:13,145 --> 01:59:14,520
It might be tough.

1915
01:59:16,478 --> 01:59:19,937
But a relationship built on truth
stays solid as a rock, sir.

1916
01:59:25,395 --> 01:59:27,353
It’s 5’o clock.
Time for me to go off duty.

1917
01:59:27,645 --> 01:59:30,895
Does this mark the end of this episode?
Or is it ‘To be continued’ tomorrow?

1918
01:59:31,937 --> 01:59:32,812
Go!

1919
01:59:33,353 --> 01:59:35,603
See you tomorrow.
See you, madam.

1920
02:00:00,895 --> 02:00:03,520
She is not educated like you...

1921
02:00:05,562 --> 02:00:08,437
Or beautiful like you.

1922
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:14,603
Or superior to you in any aspect.

1923
02:00:15,145 --> 02:00:17,895
Maybe that is why I liked her.

1924
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:23,687
Because of my inferiority complex.

1925
02:00:28,395 --> 02:00:30,937
Is it my fault that I try to be my best?

1926
02:00:32,395 --> 02:00:34,062
Is that why you are hurting me?

1927
02:00:38,062 --> 02:00:42,937
Have I ever compared myself to her?

1928
02:00:45,228 --> 02:00:46,978
But don’t I deserve a sorry?

1929
02:00:47,187 --> 02:00:48,812
After all these years.

1930
02:00:54,728 --> 02:00:57,937
Earlier, you would try to prove
that you are the perfect match for me.

1931
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:01,353
Now you are just trying to prove
you’re not doing anything wrong.

1932
02:01:01,562 --> 02:01:02,812
Why, Ramu?

1933
02:01:03,937 --> 02:01:04,812
Why?

1934
02:01:05,187 --> 02:01:07,020
Why do you have to prove
anything to me?

1935
02:01:08,978 --> 02:01:10,187
Be yourself.

1936
02:01:12,312 --> 02:01:13,728
Just be your true self.

1937
02:01:15,312 --> 02:01:16,687
There’s nothing I’d want more.

1938
02:01:20,853 --> 02:01:21,687
Hey!

1939
02:01:23,187 --> 02:01:25,812
I was scared, Yasu.

1940
02:01:27,478 --> 02:01:30,728
To look into your eyes and talk to you.

1941
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:32,603
I was scared.

1942
02:01:32,728 --> 02:01:34,228
For the things I've done...

1943
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:37,395
How do I make it up to you?

1944
02:01:45,187 --> 02:01:46,353
I’m sorry.

1945
02:01:50,478 --> 02:01:51,937
Sorry, Yasu.

1946
02:01:55,562 --> 02:01:56,687
I’m sorry.

1947
02:01:58,145 --> 02:01:59,062
Sorry.

1948
02:02:03,562 --> 02:02:06,103
- Hello…
- Why isn’t my daughter reacting?

1949
02:02:06,312 --> 02:02:08,062
Don’t ruin the moment with your curiosity.

1950
02:02:08,187 --> 02:02:09,728
Give them some time.

1951
02:02:14,187 --> 02:02:15,270
Sorry.

1952
02:02:17,937 --> 02:02:18,937
I’m sorry.

1953
02:02:23,478 --> 02:02:24,312
Sorry.

1954
02:02:32,103 --> 02:02:34,603
They are hugging each other.

1955
02:02:36,645 --> 02:02:39,353
Then close your eyes
and let me eat my dosa.

1956
02:02:41,906 --> 02:02:42,823
Sita…

1957
02:02:42,989 --> 02:02:43,656
Hmm?

1958
02:02:44,198 --> 02:02:45,989
Shall I tell you something mind blowing?

1959
02:02:47,073 --> 02:02:49,239
ARK brought Ramachandra into this house.

1960
02:02:49,864 --> 02:02:51,948
He made him the clerk and soon the CEO.

1961
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:54,531
Finally made him his son-in-law,
only for him to torture us ever since.

1962
02:02:54,614 --> 02:02:56,781
He brought home this new guy now.

1963
02:02:57,031 --> 02:03:00,489
And this guy has only doubled the torture.

1964
02:03:01,073 --> 02:03:03,906
That old man brings someone home and
that guy gets us into trouble every time.

1965
02:03:04,864 --> 02:03:07,198
What if we brought someone home?

1966
02:03:08,114 --> 02:03:09,989
That guy will be on our side then.

1967
02:03:10,323 --> 02:03:14,489
We can loot a huge sum of amount.

1968
02:03:14,614 --> 02:03:16,073
But who do we call?

1969
02:03:18,031 --> 02:03:19,239
Sudarshan?

1970
02:03:19,323 --> 02:03:21,114
She can handle him easily.

1971
02:03:21,656 --> 02:03:24,864
He's a pilot...
Actually another guy planned this meeting.

1972
02:03:25,198 --> 02:03:26,406
He is Paidithalli.

1973
02:03:26,489 --> 02:03:29,323
He alone can handle all of them easily.

1974
02:03:33,323 --> 02:03:35,323
Paidithalli... But he is from Berkley.

1975
02:03:46,781 --> 02:03:49,698
Mr. Ramachandra already said
we don’t want this deal, right?

1976
02:03:50,073 --> 02:03:51,739
His son was looking hesitant.

1977
02:03:52,198 --> 02:03:53,323
So he had to do it out of courtesy.

1978
02:03:53,489 --> 02:03:55,323
But he didn’t completely want to reject
the deal.

1979
02:03:55,489 --> 02:03:58,031
So I called him back to discuss it.

1980
02:03:58,448 --> 02:04:00,323
Let’s see what they’ve got to offer.

1981
02:04:00,489 --> 02:04:05,198
Besides, if he goes on rejecting everyone…

1982
02:04:05,323 --> 02:04:06,614
We mean…

1983
02:04:08,739 --> 02:04:10,781
Did they send you to say 'No'?

1984
02:04:12,031 --> 02:04:14,281
No matter what, I will make sure
they say 'Yes'.

1985
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:17,989
She can’t do it alone. I have to go.

1986
02:04:19,114 --> 02:04:22,406
Ramu… To hell with the company.
You sit down.

1987
02:04:23,364 --> 02:04:25,781
- Yasu, I have to go.
- I don’t care.

1988
02:04:26,114 --> 02:04:28,031
You are important to me. Okay? Sit down.

1989
02:04:28,156 --> 02:04:30,698
Wives often push their husbands
to earn more, son-in-law.

1990
02:04:30,989 --> 02:04:33,364
A wife who asks her husband to relax
is a rare sight.

1991
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:38,906
I know who can deal with them.

1992
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:52,989
Good sign! Hold this, sister.

1993
02:04:53,156 --> 02:04:54,739
I didn't zip up.

1994
02:04:58,698 --> 02:04:59,739
Put it on me.

1995
02:05:05,864 --> 02:05:07,156
Suit looks good.

1996
02:05:07,239 --> 02:05:09,948
- Valmiki…
- Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

1997
02:05:10,239 --> 02:05:11,906
Why are you all decked up?

1998
02:05:11,989 --> 02:05:13,114
Relax!

1999
02:05:14,448 --> 02:05:18,031
Permission granted by Mr. ARK?

2000
02:05:18,573 --> 02:05:20,239
I’m wanted, Valmiki!

2001
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:23,406
Thank you.

2002
02:05:26,114 --> 02:05:28,239
We have made all the arrangements
to buy shares.

2003
02:05:33,406 --> 02:05:34,323
Hello!

2004
02:05:34,573 --> 02:05:35,739
Who are you?

2005
02:05:40,448 --> 02:05:43,156
"The saviour is here"

2006
02:05:43,406 --> 02:05:46,364
"He brought showers to the barren land"

2007
02:05:47,406 --> 02:05:49,739
"The saviour does what he does best"

2008
02:05:50,114 --> 02:05:53,114
"He has given us the
hope of new beginnings"

2009
02:05:57,489 --> 02:05:59,823
"The saviour is here"

2010
02:06:00,198 --> 02:06:03,364
"He brought showers to the barren land"

2011
02:06:05,156 --> 02:06:07,448
He’s at the port, the Board meeting
and basically everywhere.

2012
02:06:11,823 --> 02:06:16,448
"I want to follow you"

2013
02:06:16,948 --> 02:06:21,531
"I want to follow you"

2014
02:06:21,823 --> 02:06:24,156
"I want to follow you"

2015
02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:26,114
Madam is like your sir’s speaker.

2016
02:06:26,364 --> 02:06:27,656
Is he like her mic?

2017
02:06:27,781 --> 02:06:30,073
This is way too many people for a meeting.
I want to hear from only one of you.

2018
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,739
Fine then. I’ll leave.

2019
02:06:35,114 --> 02:06:37,323
"Why don't you stay?"

2020
02:06:39,198 --> 02:06:41,906
"This heart belongs to you"

2021
02:06:43,239 --> 02:06:45,656
"Why don't you hug me tight?"

2022
02:06:47,281 --> 02:06:49,906
"Hold me closer to your heart"

2023
02:06:49,906 --> 02:06:53,031
Is he playing the song for my nephew?
Or is he making the most of this situation?

2024
02:06:53,073 --> 02:06:58,656
"I wonder if the word beauty
was coined after you"

2025
02:06:58,781 --> 02:07:06,739
"I'm too shy to ask you for a hug"

2026
02:07:06,906 --> 02:07:09,614
"Why don't you stay?"

2027
02:07:10,989 --> 02:07:13,739
Now that she has left…
We’ll have to see what he can do.

2028
02:07:15,281 --> 02:07:17,239
I will show you what I’m made of.

2029
02:07:18,948 --> 02:07:23,864
"I'll make you go crazy"

2030
02:07:23,989 --> 02:07:29,198
"I'll make you cheer for every moment"

2031
02:07:29,239 --> 02:07:34,114
"I'll make you go crazy"

2032
02:07:34,364 --> 02:07:39,573
"I'll make you cheer for every moment"

2033
02:07:42,614 --> 02:07:45,364
It’s time for you to play
a Pawan Kalyan number.

2034
02:07:45,573 --> 02:07:47,281
Situation doesn’t demand it, Mr. Sitaram.

2035
02:07:47,489 --> 02:07:49,781
His songs don’t need a situation.
We’re demanding it, right?

2036
02:07:50,239 --> 02:07:51,364
Hey!

2037
02:07:53,489 --> 02:07:56,323
Welcome to Vividha Bharathi’s
special telecast.

2038
02:07:56,739 --> 02:08:00,073
Upon the request of Sitaram,
brother-in-law of Kasiram from Kakinada…

2039
02:08:00,323 --> 02:08:02,323
Here’s a song from ‘Gabbar Singh’.

2040
02:08:04,573 --> 02:08:06,239
"What are you guys looking at me for?"

2041
02:08:06,448 --> 02:08:08,114
"Start playing the drums"

2042
02:08:09,948 --> 02:08:10,948
"That's right!"

2043
02:08:12,323 --> 02:08:13,239
"Oi!"

2044
02:08:15,198 --> 02:08:16,073
"Yay!"

2045
02:08:17,656 --> 02:08:22,656
"Hey, girl... A life without you is
like a spinning top without a thread"

2046
02:08:27,781 --> 02:08:33,364
"Hey, girl... A life without you is
like a cracker slipped into water"

2047
02:08:43,698 --> 02:08:45,323
What was that?

2048
02:08:45,448 --> 02:08:47,198
Get down. Idiot!

2049
02:08:47,364 --> 02:08:49,073
Is this a Board room or a Ball room?

2050
02:08:49,323 --> 02:08:50,948
Are you being an angry bird?

2051
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:54,364
You want to buy the shares Paidithalli?

2052
02:08:56,739 --> 02:08:58,906
[speaking gibberish]

2053
02:09:02,364 --> 02:09:04,364
I'm gonna tear these shares.

2054
02:09:07,073 --> 02:09:09,031
Hey! Do you know who signed that?

2055
02:09:10,031 --> 02:09:11,823
Do you know who he is? Do you?

2056
02:09:14,323 --> 02:09:17,573
(‘Abbanee Thiyyanee Debba’ song playing)

2057
02:09:35,239 --> 02:09:36,906
Your song?

2058
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:39,198
It’s you? You?

2059
02:09:40,614 --> 02:09:41,906
Mine?

2060
02:09:42,364 --> 02:09:44,073
It's mine.

2061
02:09:44,781 --> 02:09:47,781
We covered megastar’s song too.

2062
02:09:48,573 --> 02:09:51,364
His timing is amazing.

2063
02:09:52,406 --> 02:09:53,781
When will they change?

2064
02:09:54,031 --> 02:09:56,323
Why is everyone running away
when he hit one person?

2065
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:57,364
Shall we go?

2066
02:09:57,448 --> 02:10:00,239
I feel something is missing, Bantu.

2067
02:10:01,448 --> 02:10:02,823
Incomplete?

2068
02:10:03,156 --> 02:10:05,364
But I’ve played such a
versatile compilation.

2069
02:10:06,198 --> 02:10:07,448
Did you miss the dialogue?

2070
02:10:09,823 --> 02:10:10,948
Paidithalli!

2071
02:10:12,614 --> 02:10:15,156
Father is unwell.
Mother can’t go to work.

2072
02:10:15,573 --> 02:10:17,906
Grandpa is getting older...
Grandson is young.

2073
02:10:18,448 --> 02:10:20,823
Just because you have cars
and roads are empty…

2074
02:10:20,906 --> 02:10:22,489
Don’t come here whenever you want.

2075
02:10:25,448 --> 02:10:27,156
They have a brother.

2076
02:10:28,364 --> 02:10:30,198
He will stand in your way.

2077
02:10:31,739 --> 02:10:34,448
How did that sound?
- I feel like whistling.

2078
02:10:35,323 --> 02:10:38,323
A whistle isn’t enough.
We need blasting background music.

2079
02:10:38,573 --> 02:10:41,198
Slow motion… Things flying in the air…
We need lot of special effects to it.

2080
02:10:41,573 --> 02:10:43,198
I’ll plan it... Let's go.

2081
02:10:54,823 --> 02:10:56,281
- Yes!
- What happened?

2082
02:10:57,364 --> 02:10:59,406
Son-in-law, Bantu hit this one
out of the park.

2083
02:10:59,656 --> 02:11:01,198
It’s a sixer!

2084
02:11:03,739 --> 02:11:06,448
Dear, I’m throwing a party tonight.

2085
02:11:06,573 --> 02:11:08,614
And I’m going to drink. That’s all.

2086
02:11:19,323 --> 02:11:20,573
Brother, stop it.

2087
02:11:21,114 --> 02:11:23,948
Do you have any desi music
instead of this English music?

2088
02:11:27,239 --> 02:11:29,406
Wow! That sounds great.

2089
02:11:29,864 --> 02:11:31,573
Whom do we talk about?

2090
02:11:31,739 --> 02:11:34,364
Reddy? His life is boring.

2091
02:11:34,698 --> 02:11:37,906
Sekhar? No ways...

2092
02:11:38,281 --> 02:11:40,906
I'll tell about myself.

2093
02:11:41,323 --> 02:11:45,031
“Bantu was a well known dude in his area”

2094
02:11:45,198 --> 02:11:48,823
“He had a bunch of guys
follow him everywhere”

2095
02:11:48,989 --> 02:11:52,656
“They got on their bikes
one night for alcohol”

2096
02:11:52,781 --> 02:11:56,323
“They crashed every
possible store for alcohol”

2097
02:11:56,614 --> 02:12:00,198
“There she was, shining like a beer
in silk a saree”

2098
02:12:00,364 --> 02:12:04,281
“Tempting me like a packet of hot biryani”

2099
02:12:04,406 --> 02:12:08,239
“Standing on the terrace,
oh she was like the moon”

2100
02:12:08,323 --> 02:12:11,948
“Her beauty got me high,
without having to booze”

2101
02:12:12,073 --> 02:12:15,823
“While she was hopping around like a deer”

2102
02:12:15,906 --> 02:12:19,781
“Her earring fell down
and it stuck my heart”

2103
02:12:21,323 --> 02:12:24,989
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2104
02:12:25,156 --> 02:12:28,739
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2105
02:12:28,989 --> 02:12:32,739
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2106
02:12:32,864 --> 02:12:36,281
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2107
02:12:36,739 --> 02:12:40,448
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2108
02:12:40,614 --> 02:12:44,198
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2109
02:13:15,198 --> 02:13:18,823
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2110
02:13:18,989 --> 02:13:22,531
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2111
02:13:22,823 --> 02:13:26,489
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2112
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:30,531
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2113
02:14:01,031 --> 02:14:05,323
“Every time I eat betel
leaf, I think of your scent”

2114
02:14:05,406 --> 02:14:08,656
“Your red blushing
cheeks take over my mind”

2115
02:14:08,823 --> 02:14:12,989
“Every time I wear a floral shirt,
you bloom like a button”

2116
02:14:13,073 --> 02:14:16,406
“You barge into my heart
and create chaos inside”

2117
02:14:16,614 --> 02:14:20,323
“When the bulb in front
of my house flickers”

2118
02:14:20,739 --> 02:14:24,114
“It seems like you’re
winking at me naughtily”

2119
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:27,989
“When my drapes are
stuck in the door hinge”

2120
02:14:28,198 --> 02:14:31,739
“It seems like you’re pulling them
and gives me goosebumps”

2121
02:14:47,531 --> 02:14:51,364
“Like a snake swaying to
the snake charmer’s tune”

2122
02:14:51,489 --> 02:14:55,239
“I follow your track as your anklets
begin to clink”

2123
02:14:55,364 --> 02:14:59,073
“You go around like you don’t
care, sweetie”

2124
02:14:59,239 --> 02:15:03,364
“You hide and peep from a corner”

2125
02:15:04,614 --> 02:15:08,323
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2126
02:15:08,489 --> 02:15:12,198
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2127
02:15:12,281 --> 02:15:15,781
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2128
02:15:16,156 --> 02:15:19,698
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2129
02:15:20,031 --> 02:15:23,656
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2130
02:15:23,864 --> 02:15:27,573
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2131
02:15:27,698 --> 02:15:31,364
“Oh boy! She blew my mind”

2132
02:15:31,573 --> 02:15:35,489
“Oh boy! She stole my heart”

2133
02:15:56,948 --> 02:15:58,573
This house provided us a living.

2134
02:15:59,239 --> 02:16:01,114
It fed us through all these years.

2135
02:16:02,281 --> 02:16:04,323
And when they welcomed you
to this house with open arms…

2136
02:16:04,448 --> 02:16:05,698
What did you do?

2137
02:16:06,364 --> 02:16:07,948
You got into a brawl with a rowdy.

2138
02:16:09,448 --> 02:16:10,864
You kidnapped a little kid.

2139
02:16:11,031 --> 02:16:12,614
You blackmailed a millionaire.

2140
02:16:12,698 --> 02:16:14,573
You also started flirting with
their future daughter-in-law.

2141
02:16:19,323 --> 02:16:23,073
Someone like you don’t deserve
a place in any house.

2142
02:16:25,114 --> 02:16:26,531
Get out.
- Valmiki.

2143
02:16:31,239 --> 02:16:32,781
Stop calling me Valmiki.

2144
02:16:33,114 --> 02:16:34,614
Haven’t I taught you better?

2145
02:16:34,906 --> 02:16:38,114
I’m your dad! So call me that.

2146
02:16:39,489 --> 02:16:40,906
Get out.

2147
02:16:56,573 --> 02:16:59,698
You must be tired of telling the truth
ever since you were a kid.

2148
02:17:01,073 --> 02:17:02,406
Take a break.

2149
02:17:04,198 --> 02:17:08,364
When you were born, it only took me
25 minutes to bring you downstairs.

2150
02:17:09,364 --> 02:17:13,823
But it took you 25 years to climb
back to the top.

2151
02:17:16,281 --> 02:17:18,406
This time I am pushing you

2152
02:17:19,198 --> 02:17:21,239
There’s no way you can climb back up.
Impossible!

2153
02:17:23,448 --> 02:17:24,656
Relax!

2154
02:17:26,948 --> 02:17:28,823
Yes, ma’am… I am coming.

2155
02:17:37,948 --> 02:17:40,614
Thank god it’s over.

2156
02:17:46,573 --> 02:17:48,281
Why are you sad, Bantu?

2157
02:17:49,364 --> 02:17:51,948
This is what we’ve been
trying to tell them.

2158
02:17:52,656 --> 02:17:54,864
Even I’ve been trying to tell
you something.

2159
02:18:13,364 --> 02:18:15,364
Did you tell your real parents the truth?

2160
02:18:16,489 --> 02:18:17,614
I’ll never tell them.

2161
02:18:21,114 --> 02:18:25,031
Then there is no point in going
to that house.

2162
02:18:26,406 --> 02:18:28,364
I don't get it.

2163
02:18:30,864 --> 02:18:32,989
Did I leave all my problems?

2164
02:18:34,698 --> 02:18:38,114
It feels like I left an blank answer sheet
in examination hall.

2165
02:18:43,729 --> 02:18:47,562
Those papers state that half of your
company shares belong to me.

2166
02:18:48,187 --> 02:18:50,604
I want you both to sign on the papers

2167
02:18:51,062 --> 02:18:52,937
and send them to my farmhouse
with your son.

2168
02:18:53,229 --> 02:18:56,812
If you don’t, I’ll send your
niece’s dead body in an hour.

2169
02:18:57,145 --> 02:19:00,354
If you don’t seek the police,
it will just be a kidnap.

2170
02:19:00,729 --> 02:19:02,062
But if you do...

2171
02:19:03,145 --> 02:19:04,270
It will end up being a murder.

2172
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:27,645
Brother-in-law…

2173
02:19:29,854 --> 02:19:30,937
Kasi!

2174
02:19:31,395 --> 02:19:32,312
Get up.

2175
02:19:33,812 --> 02:19:34,770
Brother-in-law...

2176
02:19:34,895 --> 02:19:38,479
It was thrilling to loot someone’s
money without their notice.

2177
02:19:38,979 --> 02:19:42,770
But I didn’t know it’d be so burdening
if they gave up the money willingly.

2178
02:19:43,812 --> 02:19:45,145
I can’t carry it around.

2179
02:19:45,854 --> 02:19:47,687
I don’t know how to repay you.

2180
02:19:48,895 --> 02:19:51,229
I can’t believe you gave up your wealth
for my daughter.

2181
02:19:51,812 --> 02:19:53,687
She grew up right in
front of my eyes, Kasi.

2182
02:19:54,312 --> 02:19:55,520
Isn’t she my daughter too?

2183
02:19:57,645 --> 02:19:59,145
Calm down, Kasi.

2184
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:06,854
Raj… Raj… I don’t want you to go.

2185
02:20:07,145 --> 02:20:08,770
Your family has already done a lot for us.

2186
02:20:09,062 --> 02:20:12,312
I can’t forgive myself if anything
happened to you.

2187
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:15,145
- I will only go… Give it to me.
- Uncle, he asked me to get it.

2188
02:20:15,312 --> 02:20:17,854
Come on. Give me the money.
It’s okay. I will convince them.

2189
02:20:17,937 --> 02:20:20,604
He’s right, sir.
Let him fight for his daughter.

2190
02:20:20,979 --> 02:20:21,937
You can’t do it.

2191
02:20:22,187 --> 02:20:23,187
Come here.

2192
02:20:23,562 --> 02:20:25,312
Sir, tell him.

2193
02:20:25,437 --> 02:20:27,270
Raj is innocent...
Paidithalli is a monster.

2194
02:20:27,562 --> 02:20:29,479
He doesn’t know anything
about the outside world.

2195
02:20:29,562 --> 02:20:30,854
I know how the world works.

2196
02:20:31,729 --> 02:20:33,770
You guys don’t know me at all...
None of you do.

2197
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:40,187
I smoke a cigarette and throw it
in uncle’s balcony.

2198
02:20:40,354 --> 02:20:41,229
Every day!

2199
02:20:45,812 --> 02:20:48,187
I have a few drinks and grow
money plants in those bottles.

2200
02:20:48,312 --> 02:20:50,020
Did you know that? No, you don’t!

2201
02:20:55,354 --> 02:20:57,645
I like her…

2202
02:21:01,354 --> 02:21:03,479
I like Nandu... You don’t know that.

2203
02:21:05,437 --> 02:21:07,479
I don’t want to get married to Amulya.
You don’t know that.

2204
02:21:07,812 --> 02:21:09,020
None of you even bothered to ask.

2205
02:21:09,104 --> 02:21:10,562
And no one’s ready to listen.

2206
02:21:11,854 --> 02:21:14,520
You always complained about me
not expressing myself, right?

2207
02:21:18,229 --> 02:21:20,145
Here I am, expressing myself.
Hear me out.

2208
02:21:23,645 --> 02:21:24,937
It’s my mother’s wealth.

2209
02:21:25,687 --> 02:21:26,812
And she’s my girl.

2210
02:21:27,312 --> 02:21:28,479
I only have to go.

2211
02:21:29,104 --> 02:21:30,020
Son…

2212
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:32,562
You’d be humiliated if I hit you, uncle.

2213
02:21:42,312 --> 02:21:44,562
Bantu... Kasiram's daughter is kidnapped...

2214
02:21:44,770 --> 02:21:46,187
They are demanding company shares.

2215
02:21:46,395 --> 02:21:48,104
They are asking for Raju...

2216
02:21:48,729 --> 02:21:50,145
They'll kill him...

2217
02:21:50,354 --> 02:21:52,854
- Please do something.
- I've no connection with that house.

2218
02:21:53,270 --> 02:21:55,145
- Bantu! listen to me..
- Relax.

2219
02:22:09,437 --> 02:22:11,520
I thought you’re my savior.
But you’re also hitting me.

2220
02:22:11,729 --> 02:22:13,270
I’ve had a bad day so far.

2221
02:22:13,562 --> 02:22:14,562
What happened?

2222
02:22:15,812 --> 02:22:18,562
When my brother-in-law heard the good news
about Bantu getting kicked out…

2223
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:21,520
He decided to settle 2 things.

2224
02:22:21,937 --> 02:22:24,020
Mr. Chalapathi Rao didn't agree
to sell his farm.

2225
02:22:24,354 --> 02:22:25,729
He decided to threaten him.

2226
02:22:26,895 --> 02:22:28,562
Second, he wanted to kidnap your girl

2227
02:22:28,979 --> 02:22:30,479
and manipulate you for the shares.

2228
02:22:30,770 --> 02:22:32,062
My nephew was drinking.

2229
02:22:32,312 --> 02:22:34,312
Few goons were playing the game
‘Tiger and Goat’.

2230
02:22:34,604 --> 02:22:37,062
We were going to receive 500 crores
worth shares in 15 minutes.

2231
02:22:37,437 --> 02:22:41,854
Our men were looking at the road,
hoping this would change their lives.

2232
02:22:43,437 --> 02:22:45,104
Brother-in-law was preparing barbecue.

2233
02:22:45,604 --> 02:22:47,729
Everything was going to plan till then.

2234
02:22:50,062 --> 02:22:52,145
But at the same time…
A tiger has arrived.

2235
02:22:53,312 --> 02:22:54,645
The goat died.

2236
02:22:54,854 --> 02:22:58,895
He's a miracle worker

2237
02:22:59,145 --> 02:23:03,145
He is strong willed

2238
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:12,020
He sorts things around the city

2239
02:23:12,354 --> 02:23:16,562
He doesn't give up no matter what

2240
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:38,854
He pulled the bull's horns and
played a tune with them

2241
02:23:39,062 --> 02:23:47,354
He pulled the bull's horns and
played a tune with them

2242
02:23:52,354 --> 02:24:01,020
When everyone was terrified of the demon
like banyan's benches

2243
02:24:01,270 --> 02:24:05,354
He challenged the devil
itself for a face off

2244
02:24:14,687 --> 02:24:23,270
When there was a monster at the carnival
teasing girls…

2245
02:24:23,604 --> 02:24:32,104
He set his ways straight for a lifetime.

2246
02:24:39,062 --> 02:24:40,312
There were no knives in it.

2247
02:24:41,395 --> 02:24:43,020
None of our men either.

2248
02:24:43,895 --> 02:24:52,729
When a bunch of boys were
drowning in the flood

2249
02:24:52,895 --> 02:25:01,437
He swam against the stream
and pulled them ashore

2250
02:25:10,979 --> 02:25:19,520
He will show up wherever you dare him to be

2251
02:25:19,729 --> 02:25:27,979
He will make sure you
don't return in one piece

2252
02:25:37,895 --> 02:25:39,104
What about your brother-in-law?

2253
02:25:47,062 --> 02:25:55,645
Even if it's a hundred pound fish...

2254
02:25:56,020 --> 02:26:04,437
He will drag it to the
shore single handedly

2255
02:26:04,729 --> 02:26:13,354
His glance speaks volumes of his valor

2256
02:26:13,687 --> 02:26:17,937
He makes the ground beneath you
tremble with fear

2257
02:27:04,062 --> 02:27:05,770
It’s actually a good song, Naidu.

2258
02:27:06,854 --> 02:27:11,062
He's a miracle worker

2259
02:27:11,354 --> 02:27:15,354
A man of wonders from the North

2260
02:27:15,854 --> 02:27:20,104
He poked me with his mischievous gaze

2261
02:27:29,354 --> 02:27:37,937
When he makes her feel safe
from a bunch of rogues..

2262
02:27:38,312 --> 02:27:46,770
You can see a sparkle in her eyes.

2263
02:28:00,062 --> 02:28:02,145
Its okay. I’ll take you to the hospital.

2264
02:28:19,937 --> 02:28:21,520
When you had the intention to go…

2265
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:25,145
Why’d you tell your father you had
nothing to do with us?

2266
02:28:26,229 --> 02:28:27,312
Only during war…

2267
02:28:27,645 --> 02:28:31,020
Everyone in the country unites despite
their religion, caste and region.

2268
02:28:31,770 --> 02:28:32,854
Similarly, only during tough times…

2269
02:28:32,937 --> 02:28:34,595
Everyone in the
family comes together

2270
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:36,669
despite their selfishness,
hatred and revenge.

2271
02:28:37,979 --> 02:28:41,520
That is why I left this family
during a tough time.

2272
02:28:44,479 --> 02:28:47,062
If he asked why they should sacrifice
their wealth for her nephew…

2273
02:28:48,854 --> 02:28:51,520
Or if she said it’s her wealth and
that he is compelled to sign…

2274
02:28:51,812 --> 02:28:53,187
These papers wouldn’t have been signed.

2275
02:28:53,729 --> 02:28:56,104
They signed them because they
agreed on something.

2276
02:28:57,020 --> 02:28:59,562
After knowing, he gave up half
of his company for his daughter?

2277
02:29:00,312 --> 02:29:02,187
How can Kasiram hate his brother-in-law?

2278
02:29:07,312 --> 02:29:09,645
You wanted to see Raj get furious
and die a happy man.

2279
02:29:10,395 --> 02:29:12,312
I made it happen and you
didn’t have to die either.

2280
02:29:17,937 --> 02:29:22,854
It was really hard for me to say
I have nothing to do with this family.

2281
02:29:24,854 --> 02:29:27,479
But it was more important for you
guys to be a family.

2282
02:29:31,479 --> 02:29:33,354
My King is happy just like I hoped.

2283
02:29:33,687 --> 02:29:35,562
You can continue to visit
your Prince every day.

2284
02:29:36,270 --> 02:29:37,354
Valmiki…

2285
02:29:38,395 --> 02:29:39,437
Shall we go?

2286
02:29:40,729 --> 02:29:41,645
Let's go.

2287
02:29:44,354 --> 02:29:47,062
Do you have anything else to say, Valmiki?

2288
02:29:48,354 --> 02:29:49,312
Nothing much, sir.

2289
02:29:49,479 --> 02:29:51,812
If my son said anything to hurt you…

2290
02:29:52,437 --> 02:29:54,479
Kindly forgive him... That’s it.

2291
02:29:56,937 --> 02:29:57,729
That’s it?

2292
02:29:58,229 --> 02:29:59,062
That’s it, sir.

2293
02:29:59,312 --> 02:30:00,145
That’s it?

2294
02:30:10,187 --> 02:30:11,270
What!?

2295
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:12,645
That’s it, huh, Valmiki?

2296
02:30:13,145 --> 02:30:14,354
That’s it, huh?

2297
02:30:16,895 --> 02:30:18,229
He’s my grandson.

2298
02:30:19,604 --> 02:30:20,770
My blood.

2299
02:30:22,395 --> 02:30:23,479
My heir.

2300
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:28,562
How can you take him away
and say that’s it?

2301
02:30:28,979 --> 02:30:34,104
I heard the nurse talk to him
in the hospital.

2302
02:30:58,020 --> 02:30:59,270
Son-in-law, he’s your son.

2303
02:30:59,729 --> 02:31:01,187
The heir to my fortune.

2304
02:31:12,104 --> 02:31:13,937
I provoked the doctor because
I knew the truth.

2305
02:31:14,479 --> 02:31:16,020
I let him into the house.

2306
02:31:18,062 --> 02:31:20,604
This house, wealth, his mother and father…

2307
02:31:21,145 --> 02:31:25,520
I was wondering if he’d say
the truth to claim any of it.

2308
02:31:25,937 --> 02:31:27,104
But he didn’t.

2309
02:31:32,312 --> 02:31:35,687
My blood’s boiling ever since I found out
what he’s done.

2310
02:31:38,104 --> 02:31:39,437
How come you’re not furious?

2311
02:31:40,729 --> 02:31:42,062
No reason to be, sir.

2312
02:31:42,645 --> 02:31:44,395
God has punished him already.

2313
02:31:45,854 --> 02:31:47,979
The cramp in his leg soon
turned into a limp.

2314
02:31:49,062 --> 02:31:51,229
The joy of exchanging kids soon
turned into fear.

2315
02:31:52,312 --> 02:31:54,312
He hasn’t had a peaceful night
in the past 25 years.

2316
02:31:55,645 --> 02:31:56,604
Let him go, sir.

2317
02:31:57,687 --> 02:31:59,562
You’re not angry with any of us.

2318
02:32:00,062 --> 02:32:01,729
You’re not greedy for this wealth.

2319
02:32:03,979 --> 02:32:05,604
Why did you come to this house then?

2320
02:32:07,979 --> 02:32:10,145
It’s not only the parents that wish
for their kids’ happiness.

2321
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:14,520
Kids wish for their parents’
happiness too.

2322
02:32:16,145 --> 02:32:18,687
When I found out they were
my parents after 25 long years…

2323
02:32:19,437 --> 02:32:21,687
When I realized they were going
through tough times…

2324
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:24,979
How can I just stand there
and do nothing?

2325
02:32:26,854 --> 02:32:28,145
I would never do that, sir.

2326
02:32:29,020 --> 02:32:30,770
Everyone who cursed my dad
behind his back…

2327
02:32:30,937 --> 02:32:32,562
Should touch his feet when
everyone is watching.

2328
02:32:33,104 --> 02:32:35,312
My mom should be his best friend
in the world.

2329
02:32:35,937 --> 02:32:38,687
He shouldn’t blame himself
for failing his son.

2330
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:42,937
Ramachandra is an epitome of success.

2331
02:32:43,437 --> 02:32:45,770
He can never lose and I won’t let him.

2332
02:32:46,479 --> 02:32:48,145
That is why I came back
and did what I had to.

2333
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:50,687
I don’t need anything more than this, sir.

2334
02:33:11,020 --> 02:33:12,354
Didn’t I tell you, father-in-law?

2335
02:33:14,020 --> 02:33:14,979
Didn’t I?

2336
02:33:17,354 --> 02:33:20,062
Didn’t I tell you how my son would be?

2337
02:33:23,479 --> 02:33:24,895
He would be just like him.

2338
02:33:26,437 --> 02:33:27,854
Just like him!

2339
02:33:30,104 --> 02:33:31,312
Just like him.

2340
02:33:32,312 --> 02:33:33,354
Just like him!

2341
02:33:40,770 --> 02:33:43,104
Sir, calm down.

2342
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:48,062
Please.

2343
02:33:50,104 --> 02:33:51,312
Calm down.

2344
02:33:55,145 --> 02:33:56,270
Calm down, dad.

2345
02:34:15,770 --> 02:34:16,479
Once…

2346
02:34:17,895 --> 02:34:19,395
Once more.

2347
02:34:19,562 --> 02:34:20,812
Please calm down, father.

2348
02:34:39,812 --> 02:34:40,562
Come.

2349
02:34:40,770 --> 02:34:42,437
Let’s meet Yasu.

2350
02:34:42,604 --> 02:34:43,437
Come on.

2351
02:34:43,812 --> 02:34:45,979
Father-in-law,
we should tell her the truth.

2352
02:34:46,937 --> 02:34:48,270
We should tell her right away.

2353
02:34:49,062 --> 02:34:52,062
She will be really happy.

2354
02:34:52,104 --> 02:34:53,770
Come!
- No, sir.

2355
02:34:54,604 --> 02:34:55,770
No… Listen to me.

2356
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:03,270
25 years ago, he made the mistake of taking
two kids away from their mothers.

2357
02:35:05,062 --> 02:35:06,937
After nurturing Raj for 25 years...

2358
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:10,729
You can’t take him away from her
and make the same mistake.

2359
02:35:11,604 --> 02:35:12,812
No, sir.

2360
02:35:13,979 --> 02:35:15,562
Let’s not correct this mistake.

2361
02:35:16,562 --> 02:35:17,979
Let’s leave it here.

2362
02:35:18,770 --> 02:35:20,770
God will look after the rest.

2363
02:35:55,645 --> 02:35:58,020
You are the truth that I don't like.

2364
02:36:00,395 --> 02:36:02,395
Because you are better than my son.

2365
02:36:04,187 --> 02:36:06,270
I can't leave you...

2366
02:36:09,854 --> 02:36:11,854
But today you saved him.

2367
02:36:13,562 --> 02:36:16,187
Everything went good...

2368
02:36:18,979 --> 02:36:20,895
Otherwise, I would have lost him.

2369
02:36:23,187 --> 02:36:24,229
Bantu…

2370
02:36:25,479 --> 02:36:29,687
Women accept complete strangers
as their husbands.

2371
02:36:31,604 --> 02:36:33,854
But they don’t accept a son
they haven’t given birth to.

2372
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:40,145
I considered you my son the moment
you went there in his place.

2373
02:36:43,604 --> 02:36:45,354
Do I still have to accept you?

2374
02:37:11,729 --> 02:37:14,562
I can never repay you for everything
you have done.

2375
02:37:19,104 --> 02:37:21,312
I’m returning what you just brought to us.

2376
02:37:23,062 --> 02:37:24,145
Take it.

2377
02:37:24,895 --> 02:37:26,687
I didn’t do it expecting something
in return, ma’am.

2378
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:28,354
No please.

2379
02:37:31,604 --> 02:37:32,729
Take it.

2380
02:37:33,104 --> 02:37:35,187
Hey, Bantu. Please.

2381
02:37:36,604 --> 02:37:39,520
A son should accept everything
his mother gives him.

2382
02:37:42,479 --> 02:37:44,895
- Did I do the right thing, dad?
- Yes, dear.

2383
02:37:45,937 --> 02:37:47,562
Whatever you do is the right thing.

2384
02:37:51,812 --> 02:37:54,854
Did anyone ever ridicule Ramu
for staying with his in-laws?

2385
02:37:55,937 --> 02:37:56,979
Do you know why?

2386
02:37:58,729 --> 02:38:01,312
Because your grandpa requested him
to come home.

2387
02:38:02,854 --> 02:38:05,312
Similarly, no one should call
you Ramachandra’s son.

2388
02:38:05,895 --> 02:38:06,812
Father…

2389
02:38:06,937 --> 02:38:07,854
Yasu…

2390
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:11,895
I take back what I said the other day.
That he was born a Prince.

2391
02:38:13,270 --> 02:38:14,812
Let him climb his way up to the top.

2392
02:38:15,812 --> 02:38:17,812
Get him a job and a
quarters tomorrow itself.

2393
02:38:20,229 --> 02:38:21,854
Why do you look dull, Valmiki?

2394
02:38:22,270 --> 02:38:23,729
Half of the assets aren’t enough
for your son?

2395
02:38:23,979 --> 02:38:25,312
Shall I give him everything?

2396
02:38:26,979 --> 02:38:30,062
Coach Raj just like you did with Bantu.

2397
02:38:30,645 --> 02:38:32,437
He should become the CEO in 5 years.

2398
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:38,479
Do you like it?

2399
02:38:42,229 --> 02:38:44,270
- Hi. We got it, bro.
- Super.

2400
02:38:46,312 --> 02:38:47,395
What are they doing here?

2401
02:38:48,104 --> 02:38:50,062
Bantu introduced us.

2402
02:38:50,979 --> 02:38:52,937
So he rubbed his bad luck onto you.

2403
02:38:53,812 --> 02:38:55,020
What are those?

2404
02:38:56,645 --> 02:38:58,520
Quarters... Assigned by the company, uncle.

2405
02:38:58,645 --> 02:39:00,479
That is why we bought these
quarters to drink.

2406
02:39:01,270 --> 02:39:04,229
Dear, you belong in the Palace.

2407
02:39:04,687 --> 02:39:05,979
It hurts me to see you here.

2408
02:39:06,395 --> 02:39:11,187
Work hard for 5-6 months
and prove your worth.

2409
02:39:13,312 --> 02:39:14,895
You should become the next CEO.

2410
02:39:15,270 --> 02:39:17,104
You should go back to that house.

2411
02:39:17,395 --> 02:39:18,812
What are you talking about, uncle?

2412
02:39:19,312 --> 02:39:21,312
I’m just beginning to relax.

2413
02:39:21,604 --> 02:39:23,520
Auntie made me an omelet.

2414
02:39:23,937 --> 02:39:27,187
I’m drinking and smoking without
having to worry about it.

2415
02:39:27,437 --> 02:39:28,062
Yeah!

2416
02:39:28,229 --> 02:39:31,895
And this atmosphere...
Feels just like home.

2417
02:39:34,187 --> 02:39:36,645
Dear, I can’t catch up.

2418
02:39:37,354 --> 02:39:39,187
Can you repeat it with better grammar?

2419
02:39:40,354 --> 02:39:42,937
That is why I wrote this down.

2420
02:39:44,354 --> 02:39:46,812
25 years ago, when we were born…

2421
02:39:47,395 --> 02:39:49,145
We wouldn’t have minded the crime.

2422
02:39:49,812 --> 02:39:56,520
Put me in auntie’s ward and
Bantu in my mom’s ward.

2423
02:39:57,104 --> 02:39:58,312
It would’ve been perfect.

2424
02:40:03,395 --> 02:40:04,562
It’s a sin, dear.

2425
02:40:05,312 --> 02:40:07,479
We can’t take peoples fate
into our hands.

2426
02:40:08,854 --> 02:40:10,520
It wouldn’t work out even if we did.

2427
02:40:11,354 --> 02:40:12,937
Tear that paper.

2428
02:40:18,937 --> 02:40:20,854
Sir! What are you doing here?

2429
02:40:21,437 --> 02:40:24,645
Someone stabbed Appala Naidu
and thrashed his son.

2430
02:40:24,812 --> 02:40:27,729
So they got scared and withdrew
all their cases.

2431
02:40:27,895 --> 02:40:30,437
I wanted to give the good news to Mr. ARK.

2432
02:40:30,520 --> 02:40:32,229
I’m the one who stabbed
and thrashed his son, sir.

2433
02:40:32,312 --> 02:40:33,229
Hey! Hey!

2434
02:40:33,312 --> 02:40:35,854
Don’t claim you’ve stabbed everyone
in the world.

2435
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:37,354
Give some credit to the other criminals.

2436
02:40:37,437 --> 02:40:39,645
It’s definitely telling the truth, sir.
I know it.

2437
02:40:40,145 --> 02:40:42,104
What do you do for a living?

2438
02:40:42,770 --> 02:40:43,812
God, I hate this.

2439
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:46,062
No one believes me unless I wear this.

2440
02:40:47,604 --> 02:40:48,854
I’m a doctor. Cardiologist.

2441
02:40:48,937 --> 02:40:50,187
Show me your card.

2442
02:40:54,354 --> 02:40:56,770
No matter how critical the emergency is…

2443
02:40:57,104 --> 02:40:59,187
I swear I will never visit your hospital.

2444
02:40:59,312 --> 02:41:00,812
Sir… Sir… Sir… My card…

2445
02:41:00,895 --> 02:41:03,354
You’ve given the helicopter
to my son-in-law anyway.

2446
02:41:03,479 --> 02:41:07,395
It would be great if you give me
your old Rolls Royce.

2447
02:41:07,854 --> 02:41:11,562
Don’t revert the petrol bill to
them, please.

2448
02:41:21,145 --> 02:41:22,687
Why are you crying?

2449
02:41:24,854 --> 02:41:28,270
I didn’t know it’s so hard to see
your dreams come true.

2450
02:41:28,729 --> 02:41:30,645
You mean him? Then you’re right.

2451
02:41:31,104 --> 02:41:34,062
They give him a suit to wear...
A girl to marry.

2452
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:36,812
And a helicopter to fly in.

2453
02:41:37,104 --> 02:41:41,729
How can they be so happy after handing
over such a huge company to him?

2454
02:41:44,979 --> 02:41:48,354
I’ve been blabbering.
Don’t you have something to say?

2455
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:51,270
I was forced to.

2456
02:41:52,479 --> 02:41:53,895
Give me my card, sir. I’ll leave.

2457
02:41:54,104 --> 02:41:55,604
- Wait... Go!
- Thank you.

2458
02:41:56,062 --> 02:42:01,020
I just realized why people need break
in a moment of haze.

2459
02:42:02,479 --> 02:42:03,520
Finally!

2460
02:42:17,687 --> 02:42:19,770
“Oh my god, daddy!”

2461
02:42:19,854 --> 02:42:22,520
“Just don’t be my baddie”

2462
02:42:22,645 --> 02:42:24,562
“Oh my god, daddy!”

2463
02:42:24,770 --> 02:42:27,020
“Just don’t be my baddie”

2464
02:42:27,645 --> 02:42:29,479
“Oh my god, daddy!”

2465
02:42:29,812 --> 02:42:32,020
“Just don’t be my baddie”

2466
02:42:32,645 --> 02:42:34,729
“Don’t be so hard on me”

2467
02:42:34,895 --> 02:42:37,229
“That will make me sad”
