3
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:30,932
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

4
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,969
Munidhar. Munidhar. Put some force.

5
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:40,286
- Take care of my honor.
- Why are you shouting? I am doing it.

6
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:43,108
I swear on the holy Ganga that
I don't mix milk with water.

7
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:45,722
Come on. Wow! Raja!

8
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,016
Munidhar. Raja is losing, Munidhar.

9
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,274
Lose. Lose.

10
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,569
What is happening?

11
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:55,515
Brother Sudhir.

12
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:58,183
Bhola didn't pay
the rent for his room.

13
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:00,286
So Munidhar made him vacate the room.

14
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:03,995
And now Raja is arm
wrestling with Munidhar.

15
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:06,966
If Raja won then his
room rent will be waived off.

16
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:10,544
And if he lost Raja's
pocket will get emptied.

17
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,317
How will you defeat Raja?

18
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:14,296
Raja drinks my milk.
Come Raja, harder. Harder.

19
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,307
Raja, come on. Harder.

20
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:17,680
Good Raja.

21
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:22,534
Wow. Raja!

22
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:27,942
- Again?
- No.

23
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,258
Give him the keys.

24
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:37,014
Here is the keys.

25
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:41,370
- Bhola. - Go and rest.
- Go now.

26
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,127
- You pressed my hand a lot.
- No problem.

27
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:52,905
Make them drink more.
Fill their glasses.

28
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:55,155
I am only destined to feel jealous.

29
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:57,513
I have told you several
times not to come..

30
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,743
Here during business hours.

31
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,997
People come here to drink alcohol.
Not milk.

32
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:03,597
So what's the difference, darling?

33
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,840
You pour alcohol in glass
and make them drink it.

34
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,710
What I serve doesn't need any cure.

35
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:13,526
You have started to say
very intoxicating things nowadays.

36
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,035
I swear when I talk
your mod will become better.

37
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:21,228
If I sit here and my fortune is made..

38
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:23,727
Then just watch what I do. Yes.

39
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:25,079
What will you do?

40
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,194
What will I do?

41
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:28,255
All your alcohol will turn into milk.

42
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,349
And all my milk will
turn into alcohol.

43
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,519
I swear, you have smiled
at me thrice today.

44
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:38,171
Today I will strike
3 instead of 2 today.

45
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:42,530
So brother, did she get impressed?

46
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,063
Almost done. Just a little left.

47
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:48,712
Today pick a dollar
that she gets impressed.

48
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,803
So that I can make queen my bride.

49
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:54,215
- I will do it now.
- Okay.

50
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:11,373
I say are you or am
I the owner of those hovels?

51
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:12,830
It's you, Chamiya. It's you.

52
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,385
You are the owner. The mistress.

53
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:16,610
You are everything.

54
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:18,693
Then why did you waive
of Bholaram's rent?

55
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,720
- Tell me. 40 rupees?
- Just see.

56
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:24,450
He is a poor man with small children.

57
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:28,477
Aunty, he had been defeated.

58
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:33,166
Defeated? So did you gamble?

59
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:36,098
No. I didn't gamble. I arm wrestled.

60
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:38,315
- Just look at my hand.
- I don't care.

61
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:39,754
I want my 40 rupees.

62
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:42,686
Get it or I will deduct
it from your wages. Go.

63
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,514
My one hand is hurt
and she has hurt my leg.

64
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,665
I am hurt, mother.

65
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:55,234
Why are you remembering
your mother, Kammo?

66
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:58,443
Remember that person for
whom you are going all made-up.

67
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:02,933
- Get lost.
- What? Shall I tell father? Your secret?

68
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Expose you?

69
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,877
Brother Raja.

70
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,911
You look so good in these clothes.

71
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:12,714
Yes. Uncle.

72
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:16,545
- I beg of you.
- Uncle. - I request you.

73
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:19,321
Come on get up.
Hold your ears. Hold your ears.

74
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:22,539
Not mine. Hold yours. Yours. Yes.

75
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:23,686
Now hold your nose.

76
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,308
Hold your nose.

77
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:42,064
Jagga, move away from my path.

78
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,052
Are you in a great hurry?

79
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:47,416
What if you don't
go for your date today?

80
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:48,838
That's none of your business.

81
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:52,804
After all what is there
in that college boy, my love?

82
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,677
You can look at me with love too.

83
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:59,437
My chest is 40 inches wide.
Hug me once.

84
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:01,177
Mind your language, Jagga.

85
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:05,616
If Raja heard you he will
teach you a lesson to remember.

86
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,650
Raja. It is nothing
arm wrestling with the weak.

87
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:16,026
You need to be brave to fight Jagga.

88
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:20,451
Raja.

89
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:23,697
- Kammo. Leave.
- And you.

90
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:27,429
I have to give the poor man first aid.
You should leave.

91
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,213
- But...
- Go. Just leave.

92
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:38,394
Listen. Did you get hurt?

93
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,978
- Raja. - Yes.
- Don't interfere in my matters.

94
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:44,526
- Why? - This is a personal matter.
- All right.

95
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:46,413
So the matter is yet to be resolved.

96
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,118
Hit him Raja.

97
00:07:56,198 --> 00:07:58,735
Hit him. Hit him. Hit him.

98
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:05,481
- Wanna bet?
- 9? - 5? - 2. Tell me. - How much?

99
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,381
- 6. - 6. - 3 bet.
- 3 bet. - Come on Jagga.

100
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,334
Acting like a ruffian.

101
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,876
Hit him more.

102
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:43,738
Get up.

103
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,723
- Get up.
- Move. Move.

104
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:52,734
- 1.2.3. - Count more.
- 4.5. He is getting up.

105
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:55,742
6.7. Come on. 8.9.

106
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,777
A big thug has come.
Hit him, Raja. Hit him.

107
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:10,026
A big thug has come.
Hit him, Raja. Hit him.

108
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:21,563
He has lost.

109
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:30,029
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Wonderful.

110
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:32,126
Had a nice beginning this morning.

111
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:39,109
Hail Raja.
Hail Raja. Hail Raja.

112
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:51,897
Now why are you following me? Go back.

113
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,819
You have already caused
such a scene this morning.

114
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:58,394
What can I do?
He was speaking so dirtily.

115
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:03,508
Okay. Leave now.
I am getting late. Go now.

116
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,298
I will leave. You go. Why do you care?

117
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,767
How can I leave if
you continue to sit here?

118
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:15,789
You are a big coward.

119
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,092
Now why are you following me?

120
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:29,789
Go now.

121
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,557
If you are late you won't
be able to complete your studies.

122
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:35,164
And if you don't complete
your studies you won't get a job.

123
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:37,357
And if you don't get
a job than our wedding...

124
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,276
Don't worry, Kammo.
If god wills everything will be fine.

125
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,606
Sir Jagga. Greetings.

126
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,384
Today raja gave you
a good beating. Right?

127
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:50,136
He has sprained his neck.

128
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,692
He has not sprained his neck.

129
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:54,481
Raja has made him bow his head. Sorry.

130
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,054
But you cannot strive
in this neighborhood now.

131
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,746
Shut up, you hired minion.

132
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:02,513
Even a jackal turns
into lion sometimes.

133
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:05,941
- I want to take revenge on Raja.
- Revenge?

134
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,964
He has got a good beating
but still showing attitude.

135
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:09,140
Wow.

136
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:12,070
What is the matter, Raja?

137
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,308
Uncle, you didn't go to the bar today?

138
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:16,449
Have you left it?

139
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:20,492
Son, this habit will
stay with me till death.

140
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:22,135
Where were you since morning?

141
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:24,546
Some rogues were following me.

142
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:26,405
I was giving them a slip.

143
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:30,535
- Why were they following you?
- I don't know.

144
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:32,416
Maybe they want to take some revenge.

145
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,259
Revenge?

146
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:38,448
Do you remember Raja?

147
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:41,777
Your parents passed away 20 years ago.

148
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:46,782
Since then every moment
has been a burden for me.

149
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:51,733
That burden won't
last long now, uncle.

150
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,510
Today because of our kindness..

151
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,261
Raja is good in everything.

152
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,434
Number 1 in playing with cards.

153
00:11:58,607 --> 00:11:59,883
Best in cracking lockers.

154
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:01,688
And all the defamed clubs of Bombay..

155
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:04,434
Are dying for a glimpse of Raja.

156
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,629
What else to you need?

157
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,189
Son, I just want you to gamble
your life in this art of theft.

158
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:14,433
The one who cheated and forced..

159
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:17,276
Your parents to commit suicide.

160
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,881
Because of whom your
family was destroyed.

161
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:22,541
Your home was ruined.
Your life was ruined.

162
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,497
10,000 blind.

163
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:02,292
Game for 20,000.

164
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:26,464
Game for 20,000.

165
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,398
Friend, something
has fallen on this glass.

166
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,890
Change the glass.

167
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:42,679
Show, please.

168
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:52,678
Your money is here.

169
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:59,133
This is fraud.
The card has been changed.

170
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,344
- What do you mean?
- I saw it myself.

171
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,720
Kaliya came and gave you the card.

172
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,301
This is cruelty. This is cruelty.

173
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,992
I had won 2 lakhs. I told you...- Go.

174
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:14,742
Let me go.
That is my money. That is my money.

175
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:16,436
Take him away. Take him away.

176
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:20,241
I have been cheated.

177
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:23,798
He is the fraud. Arrest him.

178
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:27,257
- Sir.
- Cheat. Handcuff him.

179
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,036
No. No.

180
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:33,733
No. No. No. No.

181
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,565
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so scared?

182
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:46,100
Your hangs are trembling.
You are sweating.

183
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:49,354
Why are you in this condition
on the day of Diwali?

184
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:51,948
Tell me. You are under my oath.

185
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:53,377
You are under raja's oath.

186
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:58,023
That is an ill omen.
What will happen now?

187
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:00,110
What had to happen has happened?

188
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:04,920
The world will say
that I cheated my boss.

189
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,963
Parvati, I took 50,000
from my boss' locker..

190
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:11,244
And gambled it away.

191
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:13,590
I had won. I had won.

192
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:19,958
But my opponent cheated
and snatched away all my money.

193
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:21,061
Snatched it away from me.

194
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:27,000
I have decided. I will end my life.

195
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:48,985
Mother.

196
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:52,931
Father.

197
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,342
Father.

198
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:34,549
My life won't be ruined, uncle.
I have sworn.

199
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,447
One day I will find that man...

200
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,339
and avenge my parents' death.

201
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,187
That is the biggest
mission of my life.

202
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,263
Flat No. 6.

203
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:10,602
No. 4.

204
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,279
Once.

205
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,290
Come on.

206
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,403
All right 4.

207
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:22,905
Come Raja. Come.

208
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:28,182
I like your cub a lot.
I am thinking of buying it.

209
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,517
Even I have called
you here for the same.

210
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:34,009
I want you to have so much wealth..

211
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,312
So that you can
buy several such clubs.

212
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:40,344
Talk business, boss.

213
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,381
You need to break open a locker.

214
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:56,830
Feeling sleepy as soon
as you heard of work. Right?

215
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:01,771
Boss, I don't indulge in wrong work.

216
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,287
For me all this is useless.

217
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:11,071
But no one except you
can do this job, Raja.

218
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:13,730
You are an expert.

219
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:19,429
Boss, you know that all my
art and skill is for the person..

220
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:27,034
From whom I want to take revenge.

221
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,808
And you can find that man soon.

222
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:36,499
- You have reached him?
- Not me.

223
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,029
But I have surely thought about him.

224
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:40,715
Want to make a deal?

225
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,018
What do I need to do?

226
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,250
There is a bungalow in Mahabaleshwar..

227
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:49,017
Which has a locker.

228
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:50,097
And the locker has?

229
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:51,558
Diamonds worth lakhs.

230
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:55,266
Who else stays in the bungalow?

231
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:58,044
A paralyzed woman is
the owner of the bungalow.

232
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:01,126
She has a nurse who is with us.

233
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:04,250
A butler, who is our man.

234
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:06,975
When do I need to go?

235
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:09,873
Today. At this moment.

236
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,051
You will find my men at this address.

237
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:16,499
Here is the ticket.
And here's the address.

238
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,444
And my revenge?

239
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:20,347
Get the diamonds first.

240
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,655
Then I will arrange
a grand game at the club.

241
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,396
Famous card players from
all over will come here.

242
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:31,267
Among them will be the
man whom you are looking for.

243
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:35,569
You will get money.
You will find your enemy.

244
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,299
And even you will have your revenge.

245
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:48,882
Taxi.

246
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:50,758
Taxi.

247
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,642
Mister, I had stopped the taxi.

248
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:03,142
Madam, I had stopped the taxi.

249
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:05,967
I say, take another taxi.
I am getting late.

250
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,723
I say, take another taxi.
I am getting late.

251
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,979
Hurry up sir, I am in a hurry.

252
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,059
Shut up.

253
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:14,912
Yes, keep quiet.

254
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:17,344
Can't you see both madam
and her dog are barking?

255
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,546
- What?
- By the way nice dog.

256
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:20,290
Shut up.

257
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,357
Aren't you ashamed of teasing a girl?

258
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:25,046
Madam, I accept it's your rule.

259
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,235
But that doesn't mean
that you can misbehave.

260
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:30,195
By the way even you
are very beautiful.

261
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:31,884
I mean your dog.

262
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,979
What nice hair. I mean your dog.

263
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:36,627
Ill-mannered

264
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:37,925
Wild! Animal!

265
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:41,185
No need to be angry.
I will give you a lift.

266
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:43,060
Who are you to give me a lift?

267
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,529
Come, I will give you one.

268
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:49,073
It's the one and the same thing.
Let's go driver.

269
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:50,019
Where?

270
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,252
Bombay Central STD.

271
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:52,840
STD bomb Central. Come.

272
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:18,398
Where is your sweet darling the dog?

273
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:19,834
Mind your own business.

274
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:21,608
I have several businesses, madam.

275
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,733
And one of them is to help others.

276
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:28,381
I can help you like a
slave if you need anything too.

277
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,784
You don't need to say it.

278
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:31,743
You already look like a slave.

279
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,041
Oh. I think you like playing cards.

280
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:37,132
- Want to play?
- Sorry, I am not interested.

281
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:41,118
But I do.
We are bound to play sometimes.

282
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:58,298
Aren't you ashamed?

283
00:21:58,378 --> 00:21:59,751
What happened? Anything happened?

284
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:01,170
Anything happened, bros?

285
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:03,957
Not yet. But something
will surely happen now.

286
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:08,580
This is the quarrel of
love so deal it with love.

287
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:12,436
Don't punish sick love like this.

288
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:25,830
Thank god, you laughed.

289
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,401
It is a funny thing.

290
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,969
What is it?

291
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:33,938
Look you are here and even there.

292
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,478
Dog in the bus? Where is the dog?

293
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:47,941
Where is the dog? Tell me. Tell me.

294
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,957
Ganpat, there are so many dogs here.

295
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:56,133
- What did you say?
- No, sir. Not you. The dog.

296
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,456
Conductor. Conductor.

297
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:05,355
Come here.
The dog is inside the lady's bag.

298
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:08,673
Shut up. Conductor,
I am ready to buy him a ticket.

299
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,101
We don't have any ticket for the dog.

300
00:23:12,274 --> 00:23:14,954
- Either let go of the dog.
- Or leave the bus.

301
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:16,759
- Right conductor?
- Yes.

302
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:19,257
- Madam, hurry.
- The passengers are getting late.

303
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:21,214
Madam, this is bound to happen..

304
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:22,694
If you have a treacherous heart.

305
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,414
What are you thinking now?

306
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,377
Take your luggage and leave.

307
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,626
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Come on.

308
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:39,863
Madam, listen.

309
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:46,351
- Conductor, you will have to pity on the lady.
- No.

310
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,837
Look, she is about to cry.

311
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:50,967
I don't want anyone's sympathy.

312
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:59,065
Listen, madam.
I have an idea which can resolve it.

313
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,406
- The dog can travel with you.
- How?

314
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:05,810
I will you.
Conductor, come here, please.

315
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:07,345
Come here.

316
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:12,383
Your problem is that the
dog cannot ride inside the bus.

317
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:13,885
- Right?
- Yes.

318
00:24:13,965 --> 00:24:16,989
- The dog can ride on top of the bus. Right?
- Yes.

319
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:19,712
What? Where in the luggage trap above?

320
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:21,518
Where else?

321
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:27,454
Who will be responsible
if he falls down and dies?

322
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:32,156
Ask the lady to sit
above with dog and travel.

323
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:32,978
What?

324
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,528
Conductor. Conductor.

325
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:40,685
She is a lady after all.
She is a girl. So take care.

326
00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:43,755
Sir, you be kind.

327
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,192
Sit with the dog instead
of the lady and travel.

328
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,311
What do you think of it?

329
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:54,835
Give it to me. You will also remember.

330
00:24:56,316 --> 00:25:00,597
Friends at least
clap for this sacrifice.

331
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:04,684
Hail.

332
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:08,868
Come on. Come on. Come on.

333
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:20,348
Come on. Come on.

334
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:30,894
Come on. Come on.

335
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:41,785
The dog has fallen down.
Stop the bus. Stop the bus.

336
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:42,865
The dog has fallen down.

337
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,866
- Where is my Raja?
- Raja?

338
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:54,671
I mean my dog. Where did he fall down?

339
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:56,466
There. There he is.

340
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:02,502
- Raja.
- Raja.

341
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:06,206
- Raja.
- Raja.

342
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:08,866
- Raja.
- Raja.

343
00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:11,568
Raja. Raja.

344
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,012
Come on, Raja. Raja.

345
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:17,244
You are laughing here.

346
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:18,639
My dog got lost because of you.

347
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,066
Because of you. Because of you.

348
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:23,935
Madam, let the dog go.
He was a wise animal.

349
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:24,638
So he is gone

350
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:26,898
Now hurry. Otherwise we will be late.

351
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:31,362
Look, the bus people
are calling us. Come on.

352
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:34,173
You can leave. I need to find my dog.

353
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:34,865
Raja.

354
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:36,130
Go ahead. Find him.

355
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:40,118
Raja. Raja. Raja.

356
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:44,442
Why are you crying? Look, I have come.

357
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:45,610
You are here again.

358
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,966
When you call your dog
I feel like you are calling me.

359
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,702
I am not interested in you.
Please leave

360
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:57,815
Okay. Okay.
I am leaving. But remember.

361
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:01,177
If the bus leaves you will
have to walk till Mahabaleshwar.

362
00:27:01,793 --> 00:27:02,863
Yes.

363
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:12,345
Congrats, madam.

364
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:15,469
The bus people were
smarter than the dog.

365
00:27:16,614 --> 00:27:18,723
Thank god, they left our luggage.

366
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,423
Now how will walk till
Mahabaleshwar, madam?

367
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,257
I don't need your sympathy.

368
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:27,608
Don't bother me.

369
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,759
We will each take our own roads.

370
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,523
Madam, the problem is that we have..

371
00:27:31,547 --> 00:27:33,824
To take the same road
for the same destination.

372
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:37,056
No use fighting like it.

373
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:39,986
It will be better
if we become friends.

374
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:54,181
"This is the quarrel of love."

375
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:57,381
"So decide with love."

376
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:04,397
"Don't punish sick love like this."

377
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:07,457
"This is the quarrel of love."

378
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:10,787
"So decide with love."

379
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:17,747
"Don't punish sick love like this."

380
00:28:17,827 --> 00:28:21,193
"This is the quarrel of love."

381
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:48,370
"This road cannot be traveled alone."

382
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:55,127
"Madam, you should
have a support for life."

383
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:05,154
"This road cannot be traveled alone."

384
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:11,747
"Madam, you should
have a support for life."

385
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:15,194
"If not for me than for yourself."

386
00:29:15,274 --> 00:29:18,356
"If not for me than for yourself."

387
00:29:18,436 --> 00:29:22,044
"Care a little."

388
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:25,233
"This is the quarrel of love."

389
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,598
"So decide with love."

390
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:35,327
"Don't punish sick love like this."

391
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,476
"This is the quarrel of love."

392
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:05,342
"Different attitude with new styles."

393
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:12,599
"I found a new secret
under the eyelids."

394
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:22,127
"Different attitude with new styles."

395
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:28,789
"I found a new secret
under the eyelids."

396
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:32,505
"What is this secret?"

397
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,559
"What is this secret?"

398
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:39,126
"Tell me this secret."

399
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:42,436
"This is the quarrel of love."

400
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:45,599
"So decide with love."

401
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:52,398
"Don't punish sick love like this."

402
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:57,180
"This is the quarrel of love."

403
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,803
Where are you going on foot, Raja?

404
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,600
- Mahabaleshwar.
- Come I will drip you.

405
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:11,719
Thank you. Bye, madam.

406
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,922
I pray that your journey
on foot is successful.

407
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:22,817
May god save you from wild
animals and poisonous snakes.

408
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,752
And if any hill bandit
attacks you with a dagger then...

409
00:31:26,832 --> 00:31:30,334
- Then? - Sorry madam. Bye.
- Listen.

410
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,513
Are you really leaving me?

411
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:35,621
What can I do, madam?
I have teased you a lot.

412
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:39,591
- Bored you a lot.
- Oh no. - That's why, bye.

413
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:46,406
No, please don't leave me.
Take me with you. Raja.

414
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,317
- Are you calling me or that dog?
- You.

415
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:54,287
- Say it again. Raja.
- Raja.

416
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,270
- Once again with love. Raja.
- Raja.

417
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:01,956
- Come on, sit fast.
- Come madam. - Come on.

418
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:03,036
Come on. Hurry.

419
00:32:44,682 --> 00:32:49,616
- Mahabaleshwar.
- Okay Raja. Bye. Bye. - Bye.

420
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,244
When will I meet you again?

421
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:55,276
Is it necessary to meet?

422
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:58,249
Yes. it is necessary now.

423
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:04,470
Then we will meet
like this again one day.

424
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:15,449
- Tata. Tata.
- Bye.

425
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:33,956
You are Shetty who is working
a butler in that bungalow.

426
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:34,659
Right?

427
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:35,739
Good.

428
00:33:39,772 --> 00:33:41,069
Welcome Raja.

429
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:44,766
Dolly. Nurse?

430
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,540
- Drink?
- It's too early.

431
00:33:49,437 --> 00:33:50,897
Talk about work, Dolly.

432
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:02,401
- Plan.
- This is the layout of that bungalow.

433
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:04,789
These trees are inside this gate.

434
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,535
And you will hide here
and wait for my signal.

435
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:09,190
Interesting.

436
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,216
I will turn off the light
of the 3rd window on the 1st floor.

437
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:15,124
Climb up with the help
of the pipe on the wall.

438
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:18,387
From the balcony to the bedroom...

439
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:20,761
I will keep the door open.

440
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:22,804
This is the locker room.

441
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:24,999
This is the safe.

442
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:28,490
Hidden behind the painting.

443
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:32,382
Your work is only to unlock the safe.

444
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:35,182
Very interesting.

445
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:37,483
4 hours are left now.

446
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,646
Reach there sharp at 11 o'clock.

447
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,321
Come on, Shetty.

448
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:21,852
You?

449
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:24,187
But what are you doing here?

450
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:27,138
- How did you come inside?
- Through that balcony.

451
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:28,458
But?

452
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:32,361
Didn't I say that we
will meet again suddenly?

453
00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:34,534
How did you know that I am here?

454
00:35:34,706 --> 00:35:36,339
This is my grandma's home.

455
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,107
How many things will
you ask at one go?

456
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:41,247
And I have only one answer.

457
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:48,598
Love lit the way of way
and my heart's desire got me here.

458
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:53,658
Really? It is very
difficult understand you.

459
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,906
You are seeing difficulties already?

460
00:35:58,545 --> 00:36:00,372
The journey has just started.

461
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:03,442
I was still thinking of that journey.

462
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:07,744
Did you remember your co traveler?

463
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,639
I remembered the journey
because of the co-traveler.

464
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:13,418
And to tell the truth
that journey has brought..

465
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:16,793
Me to such a turning point in life..

466
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:20,382
That I am confused now.
Where should I go?

467
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:25,139
- Maybe someone is coming.
- Let them.

468
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:28,004
Oh no. You go now.
Come in the morning.

469
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,328
I want you to introduce
you to my grandma.

470
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:32,783
Is it necessary to get introduced?

471
00:36:34,178 --> 00:36:35,972
Okay. Bye.

472
00:36:36,513 --> 00:36:38,545
- Where are you going?
- Through the balcony.

473
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:41,000
Go through the straight path.

474
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,567
Straight path.

475
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,027
You need someone's support
to take the right path.

476
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:50,881
Come on hold my hand and
take me through the right path.

477
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:15,466
What can I say, madam?

478
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:17,931
The government says
since it is called a taxi..

479
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:19,639
We need to levy taxes on it.

480
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:23,629
Road tax. Tire tax, horn tax.
Engine tax. Taxes.

481
00:37:23,802 --> 00:37:24,829
What to say?

482
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:27,661
Madam, here is your destination.

483
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:33,855
- What's the fare?
- I will. Just a moment.

484
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,217
- What happened?
- What can I say?

485
00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:41,432
See for yourself.
I am ashamed to tell the fare.

486
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:42,946
- Why?
- Madam..

487
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:45,291
Whenever my meter stops at 420..

488
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:46,664
An accident occurs.

489
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:48,643
So just give me 4 rupees and..

490
00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:50,925
Throw the remaining 20 paisa at sea.

491
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:54,114
Maybe the accident will get averted.
Thank you.

492
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:57,184
Save me, my lord.

493
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:01,119
- Taxi, come on.
- Where?

494
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:03,465
Taxi drivers have
a bad habit of asking.

495
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:05,876
- Where? To hell.
- To hell right?

496
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:07,909
- One way or round trip?
- Come on.

497
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:09,973
Sir, why are getting
angry unnecessarily?

498
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:12,493
You want to go to hell, right? Sit.
I will take you there now.

499
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:17,692
- What kind of basket is this?
- Basket?

500
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:21,172
Driver, if this basket stays here,
where will the girl sit?

501
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:23,713
Basket. Oh yes.

502
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:27,205
This might belong to that girl.

503
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:29,961
- Sir, sit. I will go and give the girl her basket.
- Go.

504
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,356
It's heavy.

505
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:35,583
Madam. Madam.

506
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:38,946
Where are you, madam?
You have left behind your goods.

507
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:42,308
I asked her to put
the money in the sea.

508
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,005
Did she also jump into the sea?

509
00:38:45,486 --> 00:38:46,513
Strange.

510
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:48,513
First people will forget
their stuff in the taxi.

511
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:49,973
And they will label us as thieves.

512
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:53,648
Kids cry a lot in India.

513
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,167
Kid? Damn.

514
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:03,918
What bad luck.

515
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:07,281
I already knew when god
struck 420 in the meter..

516
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:09,205
Something bad was
bound to happen. Done.

517
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:12,438
Driver, hurry up. We are getting late.

518
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:14,460
You are getting late.
I am in a fix here.

519
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:18,189
Get another tax for hell.
I am myself in hell here.

520
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,853
Did you here? We are getting late.

521
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:21,032
And he doesn't care at all.

522
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:23,000
Come, we will take another taxi. Come.

523
00:39:24,524 --> 00:39:28,005
Doesn't care at all?
Don't you care at all either?

524
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,075
Did your mother only get me to trap?

525
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:36,167
Where do I leave this fool?

526
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:42,837
Where do I dump him?

527
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:46,838
I will keep him here.

528
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:50,318
- Hey.
- Hello, constable.

529
00:39:50,502 --> 00:39:52,286
- Is that your taxi.
- It is mine.

530
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,599
What are you doing here?

531
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:56,264
Urinated. I mean my baby urinated.

532
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,162
- What a cute baby.
- Cute for you.

533
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:00,373
But problem for me.

534
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:02,189
Thank god that you
have such a cute baby.

535
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:04,891
Here even after 20 years
of age there is no baby.

536
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:06,361
Then take him.

537
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,752
What nonsense.
Move the taxi. It's a no parking zone.

538
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:11,107
No parking. I will park the taxi.

539
00:40:11,187 --> 00:40:12,945
Where should I park him? No parking.

540
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:31,257
What are you hiding here?
Your sins. Listen.

541
00:40:31,337 --> 00:40:32,587
Don't listen.

542
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:41,235
Look, if a girl tries to hide
her sins all men come after her.

543
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:43,170
And look at the sins of men?

544
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:46,414
- This is not my sins.
- Then, is he your father's sins?

545
00:40:46,597 --> 00:40:47,635
My father? That is mean.

546
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:50,174
I mean as a punishment
of some sin I committed..

547
00:40:50,254 --> 00:40:51,104
I am stuck with him.

548
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:54,110
You got him because you
fooled some innocent girl.

549
00:40:54,304 --> 00:40:55,720
- Shameless.
- Beat him.

550
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,439
Beat him. Beat him.
Beat him. Beat him. Beat him.

551
00:40:59,612 --> 00:41:03,061
- Beat him. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him.
- Hey where are you running?

552
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
You?

553
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,974
What do you want?

554
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:26,596
I just want your blessings.

555
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,531
You don't look like
a thief but are one.

556
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:34,639
What? Pardon me. I...

557
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,720
You have come to meet Renu, right?

558
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:39,521
She has gone to take bath in the lake.

559
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:03,471
"Blouse got wet."

560
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,268
"Hair got wet."

561
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:11,822
"This body got wet."

562
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:20,295
"What will happen
if my darling comes now?"

563
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,579
"Blouse got wet.
Hair got wet."

564
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:25,295
"This body got wet."

565
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:30,227
"What will happen
if my darling comes now?"

566
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:32,795
"Blouse got wet."

567
00:42:57,321 --> 00:43:00,159
"I will feel shy."

568
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,848
"I will get flustered."

569
00:43:07,145 --> 00:43:09,929
"I will feel shy."

570
00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:13,524
"I will get flustered."

571
00:43:14,523 --> 00:43:20,726
"How will I explain why
I am in such a condition?"

572
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:24,171
"My heart beats fast."

573
00:43:24,361 --> 00:43:29,064
"I shiver with my entire body?"

574
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:31,145
"What will happen?"

575
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:36,888
"What will happen
if my darling comes now?"

576
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,577
"Blouse got wet.
Hair got wet."

577
00:43:39,657 --> 00:43:41,901
"This body got wet."

578
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:46,901
"What will happen
if my darling comes now?"

579
00:43:46,981 --> 00:43:49,374
"Blouse got wet."

580
00:44:08,848 --> 00:44:11,564
"I look for him quietly."

581
00:44:11,644 --> 00:44:15,119
"I sigh for him stealthily."

582
00:44:18,537 --> 00:44:21,348
"I look for him quietly."

583
00:44:21,428 --> 00:44:24,578
"I sigh for him stealthily."

584
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:31,915
"And I secretly think
how to love you."

585
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:37,631
"His love is so lovely?"

586
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:39,793
"What will happen?"

587
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:46,009
"What will happen
if my darling comes now?"

588
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:48,455
"Blouse got wet.
Hair got wet."

589
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:50,834
"This body got wet."

590
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:55,793
"What will happen
if my darling comes now?"

591
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:58,293
"Blouse got wet."

592
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:25,172
"Today was wonderful."

593
00:45:25,252 --> 00:45:29,117
"It was my delicate youth."

594
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:38,589
"There was cold water
full off fragrance."

595
00:45:39,224 --> 00:45:46,386
"The way the garden.
The way the garden was fragrant."

596
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,764
"What will happen?"

597
00:45:49,305 --> 00:45:54,643
"What will happen
if my darling comes now?"

598
00:45:54,723 --> 00:45:57,035
"Blouse got wet.
Hair got wet."

599
00:45:57,115 --> 00:45:59,481
"This body got wet."

600
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:04,251
"What will happen
if my darling comes now?"

601
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:06,630
"Blouse got wet."

602
00:46:09,427 --> 00:46:10,981
Where did you come from?

603
00:46:14,562 --> 00:46:16,359
And how did you get wet?

604
00:46:17,184 --> 00:46:21,819
I haven't got wet madam.
I am sweating after seeing you.

605
00:46:23,495 --> 00:46:25,292
- Come.
- Let's go.

606
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:32,616
- Grandma. Grandma.
- Move.

607
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:35,252
What grandma? Where grandma?

608
00:46:35,481 --> 00:46:37,535
Even you have sprouted wings now.

609
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:41,198
You might fly away
leaving your grandma alone.

610
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:44,306
Sit, son. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.

611
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:50,184
Butler, serve the breakfast. Hurry.

612
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:53,305
They are young. If they don't
eat they will fill their stomachs..

613
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:55,751
By looking at each other.

614
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:59,427
- I have lost my hunger.
- Then have coffee.

615
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:01,103
Butler, serve coffee.

616
00:47:01,183 --> 00:47:04,440
Just coffee?
Or anything else with coffee?

617
00:47:04,994 --> 00:47:06,575
Coffee is enough.

618
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:09,832
I have already got the rest.

619
00:47:16,143 --> 00:47:17,630
Cool it down and then drink.

620
00:47:18,454 --> 00:47:19,900
- Yes?
- Yes.

621
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:26,076
So sir, your baby?

622
00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:28,819
- It's mine.
- But when did you get married?

623
00:47:29,157 --> 00:47:32,062
Having kids without
marriage is against the law.

624
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:33,697
But not against nature. Go.

625
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,616
Sir, you turned out to be very smart.

626
00:47:36,696 --> 00:47:38,776
So today I will treat
to fried rice instead of bread.

627
00:47:38,914 --> 00:47:41,104
Also get some brains.
I have lost my brains.

628
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,212
Motilal, get some brains for the sir.

629
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:46,996
Also get some biscuits.

630
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:50,456
Biscuits? Who asked for biscuits?

631
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,118
Me.

632
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,185
Oh... Oh God!

633
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:04,198
- Murli sir, won't you have brains?
- No.

634
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,171
Strange. Cancel the brains.

635
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:26,196
You can speak.

636
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:27,669
Even you can speak.

637
00:48:27,886 --> 00:48:29,710
But how can you speak?

638
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:31,453
The way you can speak.

639
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,385
Strange.

640
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,426
Am I dreaming? Let me light a match.

641
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:42,183
I am dead.

642
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:44,439
I don't know how this happened.

643
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:46,574
You are a very good man.

644
00:48:46,654 --> 00:48:48,344
I am good,
that's why I am trapped so bad.

645
00:48:48,547 --> 00:48:50,035
I feel like tearing
my clothes and get out.

646
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:51,452
Just coming.

647
00:48:51,938 --> 00:48:53,965
Than you are even
smaller baby than me.

648
00:48:54,045 --> 00:48:56,019
Are you a bay or my master?

649
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,356
I don't know where to go,
whom to tell.

650
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,572
And what will I say?

651
00:48:59,652 --> 00:49:02,140
If I tell people that a year
old baby speaks like an elder..

652
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,420
They will think I am crazy.

653
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:05,032
I wish I could go somewhere.

654
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:07,085
At least you would have got rid of me.

655
00:49:07,302 --> 00:49:08,788
Goodness, don't go anywhere.

656
00:49:08,868 --> 00:49:10,599
You will create problems
wherever you go.

657
00:49:11,112 --> 00:49:12,923
Even you are in trouble.

658
00:49:13,003 --> 00:49:15,112
Since this is my problem,
I will have to face it.

659
00:49:15,545 --> 00:49:17,896
From now we belong to each other.
Come on.

660
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:20,666
Well done.
Let's have an ice cream on that note.

661
00:49:20,855 --> 00:49:23,139
Ice cream?
This friendship will cost me dear.

662
00:49:23,423 --> 00:49:24,977
Come on. Let's have ice cream.

663
00:49:26,072 --> 00:49:28,153
- Give one ice cream.
- Yes, sir.

664
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,708
- Give 2. You eat too.
- Who said so?

665
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,773
I did. Who else will?

666
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:34,946
Your mouth was closed.

667
00:49:35,026 --> 00:49:37,021
When I close my mouth I speak more.

668
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:38,513
Small mouth. Big talks. Got it?

669
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:40,372
Stop talking and give ice cream.
Come on.

670
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:46,350
Thank you. Here's the money.

671
00:49:56,177 --> 00:49:58,112
Look, Mr. Galaxo. Look at that.

672
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,701
This is Mumbai's racecourse.

673
00:49:59,907 --> 00:50:03,820
Here horses run and
donkeys play. Got it?

674
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,500
Now you need to understand who
is the horse and who is the donkey.

675
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:08,512
Taxi.

676
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,749
- What hot stuff.
- Is it?

677
00:50:15,062 --> 00:50:19,375
You are so small and ogling big women.

678
00:50:19,786 --> 00:50:22,456
Call some more.
She is coming. Get ready.

679
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:27,007
- Taxi. Mumbai Central.
- Good wife.

680
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:29,732
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

681
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:31,699
If you didn't speak
then who did? Hell?

682
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,153
- You are going to hell.
- What?

683
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,158
- And you said nothing.
- Forget it.

684
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:38,661
We will get another taxi.

685
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:39,851
What did you say?

686
00:50:39,931 --> 00:50:41,383
If you get rid of
passengers like this..

687
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:43,602
Both of us will
die of hunger. Got it?

688
00:50:43,682 --> 00:50:47,159
He was running away with that girl.
Look at the police.

689
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:50,348
He is that rogue. Catch him.

690
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:56,737
Thank you, Mr.
Galaxo. You are the greatest Hitler.

691
00:50:56,817 --> 00:50:58,023
You are great.

692
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:13,623
"Who can be crazier for you than me?"

693
00:51:13,883 --> 00:51:17,992
"Just tell me how
long have you loved me?"

694
00:51:18,673 --> 00:51:20,641
"Is it? Very good."

695
00:51:22,057 --> 00:51:26,576
"Who can be crazier for you than me?"

696
00:51:26,748 --> 00:51:30,964
"Just tell me how
long have you loved me?"

697
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:52,684
"No matter how hard
the roads of life are."

698
00:51:52,764 --> 00:51:57,300
"My entire life is for you, darling."

699
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,235
"Wonderful."

700
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:03,581
"No matter how hard
the roads of life are."

701
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:07,851
"My entire life is for you, darling."

702
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:12,456
"The crazy one might
stop after a couple of steps."

703
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:16,738
"Just tell me how
long have you loved me?"

704
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:21,386
"Who can be crazier for you than me?"

705
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:25,689
"Just tell me how
long have you loved me?"

706
00:52:42,982 --> 00:52:47,317
"Maybe destiny has
got something else for us."

707
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:51,771
"We have now started no
matter how far our goal is."

708
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:58,312
"Maybe destiny has
got something else for us."

709
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:02,624
"We have now started no
matter how far our goal is."

710
00:53:02,704 --> 00:53:07,175
"The story of love
cannot be left undone."

711
00:53:07,255 --> 00:53:11,477
"Just tell me how
long have you loved me?"

712
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:15,931
"Who can be crazier for you than me?"

713
00:53:16,011 --> 00:53:20,407
"Just tell me how
long have you loved me?"

714
00:53:42,645 --> 00:53:45,985
Boss called.
We cannot wait any longer now.

715
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,272
Raja, the work should
be done immediately now.

716
00:53:50,071 --> 00:53:52,104
I said I need some time.

717
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:56,828
Time? For what? To enjoy with Renu?

718
00:53:57,476 --> 00:54:00,774
Don't forget that you
have not come here for love.

719
00:54:01,379 --> 00:54:03,942
I know why I have come here.

720
00:54:04,169 --> 00:54:05,574
And understand one thing.

721
00:54:06,763 --> 00:54:08,374
Raja is no one's slave.

722
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,898
And he doesn't take any orders.

723
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:15,423
Even here nobody shirks
from work, brother.

724
00:54:15,801 --> 00:54:16,871
Listen properly.

725
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,919
If Renu comes into our way then...

726
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:22,033
Shetty!

727
00:54:22,222 --> 00:54:25,444
I have committed 24 murders till now.

728
00:54:25,735 --> 00:54:28,751
Renu's murder will
commemorate my silver jubilee.

729
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:30,102
What do you mean?

730
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:33,843
Renu goes for morning walk every day.

731
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:37,335
She might not return one day.

732
00:54:37,572 --> 00:54:42,264
- If you even look at Renu then...
- Then?

733
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,346
No! We have forgotten our
job and fighting among ourselves.

734
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,266
Finish the job raja.

735
00:55:58,526 --> 00:56:02,426
I am bored of playing
an innocent nurse.

736
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:04,467
Oh you.

737
00:56:06,603 --> 00:56:07,693
Damn it.

738
00:57:09,781 --> 00:57:10,781
Why did you stop?

739
00:57:12,038 --> 00:57:13,794
Hurry up, otherwise I will shoot.

740
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:14,874
Hurry up.

741
00:57:57,904 --> 00:57:59,729
How long will you erase and draw?

742
00:58:00,196 --> 00:58:00,965
Renu?

743
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:02,859
You can erase the image.

744
00:58:03,197 --> 00:58:06,509
But can you erase the
image made in the heart?

745
00:58:07,469 --> 00:58:09,433
Renu, I am leaving.

746
00:58:09,597 --> 00:58:10,597
Where?

747
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,299
Back.

748
00:58:13,644 --> 00:58:15,115
So soon?

749
00:58:15,643 --> 00:58:16,750
Yes, Renu.

750
00:58:19,465 --> 00:58:23,816
I couldn't do the job
I had come here to perform.

751
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:28,062
That's why it is better to leave.

752
00:58:29,246 --> 00:58:31,158
May I ask something?

753
00:58:31,238 --> 00:58:32,179
Yes?

754
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:35,707
Won't you feel anything
if you leave me alone like this?

755
00:58:42,392 --> 00:58:46,604
Renu. I am helpless.
I will have to go.

756
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:49,120
Okay. Go.

757
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:53,246
- Are you angry?
- No.

758
00:58:53,773 --> 00:58:55,788
Won't you meet grandma before leaving?

759
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,149
Of course, I will. Come.

760
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:02,327
Mother, when Ghanshyam...

761
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:17,097
Look, the girl is here.

762
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:20,642
- Hi daddy.
- Renu, dear.

763
00:59:20,876 --> 00:59:23,263
- So were you teasing my mother?
- No.

764
00:59:23,343 --> 00:59:24,343
Not at all?

765
00:59:29,447 --> 00:59:31,946
Why are you standing
here like a statue? Come here.

766
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:37,792
He is the thief who wants
to steal our girl from us.

767
00:59:38,294 --> 00:59:39,617
- Is it?
- Yes.

768
00:59:40,984 --> 00:59:44,366
Young man,
how did you enchant my mother?

769
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,030
She has been praising
you since I have come.

770
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,999
She was not even pleased
to see me arrive.

771
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:51,831
I wouldn't have called
for another 2-4 years.

772
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:55,039
But Renu had selected
the boy so soon..

773
00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:56,794
That I had to call you.

774
00:59:57,002 --> 01:00:01,586
But grandma, daddy is here
and look he wants to leave.

775
01:00:02,218 --> 01:00:03,218
Today itself.

776
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:06,689
What did you say?
I will see how you will leave.

777
01:00:07,173 --> 01:00:09,085
My son is a rich man from the city.

778
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:10,711
He will have you arrested.

779
01:00:10,918 --> 01:00:13,573
- Actually...
- What do you do, dear?

780
01:00:14,049 --> 01:00:15,311
I do a lot.

781
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:18,615
I have spent my life
doing something or the other.

782
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:20,094
Your parents?

783
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:22,983
Oh I am sorry.

784
01:00:23,372 --> 01:00:25,837
Did they face any tragedy?

785
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,291
It will be better if you
don't ask me anything about it.

786
01:00:31,485 --> 01:00:35,706
Just understand that
I have always lived alone.

787
01:00:37,254 --> 01:00:42,175
Look dear ne must never
consider themselves as alone.

788
01:00:43,247 --> 01:00:45,504
And now we all are there with you.

789
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:51,714
No matter who you are,
whatever you are I like you.

790
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,867
Stay for tonight.

791
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:55,376
We will leave together tomorrow.

792
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,327
Okay. Come. Come.

793
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:01,963
This is your room.

794
01:01:04,972 --> 01:01:06,097
This room.

795
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:08,302
I won't be able to sleep here.

796
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,888
Don't be silly.
It's only for the night.

797
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:13,603
All of us will leave together
in the morning. Go. Sleep.

798
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:19,830
Good night and sweet dreams.

799
01:01:25,028 --> 01:01:26,317
Sweet dreams!

800
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:34,010
Hello, friend.

801
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:35,425
Boss!

802
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,645
Good eyesight.

803
01:03:37,348 --> 01:03:40,246
Thank goodness your eyes
are still working right..

804
01:03:40,326 --> 01:03:42,806
And you recognized
me in spite of this love play.

805
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:45,761
What is the plan?

806
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:47,785
What plan?

807
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:49,298
Look Raja.

808
01:03:49,604 --> 01:03:51,775
At this time everyone
is unconscious in their rooms.

809
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:57,880
The safe is here.
Just work your fingers.

810
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:00,189
I can't do this job now.

811
01:04:00,907 --> 01:04:02,818
Did you her, boss?
What did I tell you?

812
01:04:05,006 --> 01:04:08,552
Go out and tell them
to keep an eye on every room.

813
01:04:10,023 --> 01:04:12,445
If anyone wakes up,
make them faint again.

814
01:04:14,512 --> 01:04:17,868
I want to bring my
friend to senses here.

815
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,415
Cigarette?

816
01:04:19,495 --> 01:04:21,776
Boss. I have already told you.

817
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:27,684
You have said a lot.
Listen to me first.

818
01:04:29,293 --> 01:04:30,677
Come on. Open the locker.

819
01:04:31,412 --> 01:04:32,536
No.

820
01:04:32,804 --> 01:04:35,970
Shetty. I think Raja
has forgotten our language.

821
01:04:36,842 --> 01:04:39,221
Remind him of our language.

822
01:06:13,126 --> 01:06:14,423
- Open them.
- No.

823
01:06:15,383 --> 01:06:16,429
Good.

824
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,963
Raja, if these hands don't
prove to be useful to me..

825
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:21,558
Then I can render
them useless forever.

826
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,877
The room is empty
but where is the owner?

827
01:06:38,881 --> 01:06:40,671
Is there a owner of this room?

828
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,753
10 rupees rent and 200 rupees deposit.

829
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:51,660
- 200 rupees deposit?
- Yes. - Listen. - Yes.

830
01:06:51,684 --> 01:06:52,964
- I am a poor taxi driver.
- Yes.

831
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:54,358
- I can pay a rent of 10 rupees.
- Yes.

832
01:06:54,382 --> 01:06:55,980
But I cannot pay
200 rupees as deposit.

833
01:06:56,326 --> 01:06:58,635
- Can you lessen it?
- Ask that off the mistress.

834
01:06:58,715 --> 01:06:59,941
- Mistress?
- Yes. - And you?

835
01:07:00,021 --> 01:07:01,238
I am the manager here.

836
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,281
- General Manager.
- General Manager. - Yes.

837
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:07,802
- Where is the mistress?
- I will call her. Madam.

838
01:07:08,614 --> 01:07:09,614
Madam.

839
01:07:11,279 --> 01:07:13,415
- What is it?
- Come here.

840
01:07:13,495 --> 01:07:14,799
Why are you shouting?

841
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,670
- A customer has come.
- For the room.

842
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:19,875
Only a family man will get a room.

843
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,164
Do you have a family?

844
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:21,925
I have a baby.

845
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:23,599
If he has a baby he
is bound to have a family.

846
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:24,348
What are you saying?

847
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,464
Go and show him the room.

848
01:07:25,544 --> 01:07:26,977
I will go and play gambling.

849
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:30,064
Don't do that. Try other way.

850
01:07:30,307 --> 01:07:33,498
Wow. You seem to be smart.
What did you say?

851
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:35,756
- 2 and 7.
- 2 and 7. - Yes.

852
01:07:37,045 --> 01:07:38,766
Come and check the room.

853
01:07:39,258 --> 01:07:40,849
Son, do you even gamble?

854
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:44,291
I am an expert. I had defeated many.

855
01:07:44,577 --> 01:07:47,526
- Are you coming or not?
- Coming. Coming, madam.

856
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:49,533
- I have come.
- Look.

857
01:07:49,948 --> 01:07:51,764
- Seen.
- Do you like it?

858
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:53,248
I like it a lot.

859
01:07:53,701 --> 01:07:54,817
I am referring to the room.

860
01:07:54,897 --> 01:07:56,339
Even I am referring to the room.

861
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:57,965
Then go and bring your wife.

862
01:07:58,045 --> 01:08:00,456
Wife? But I am not yet married.

863
01:08:01,892 --> 01:08:03,388
Then how did you get a child?

864
01:08:04,132 --> 01:08:06,121
Can't one have a
baby without marriage?

865
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:09,572
You seem like a rogue. Go away.

866
01:08:09,996 --> 01:08:12,400
I will leave but where
will I take this baby.

867
01:08:12,815 --> 01:08:13,896
Have pity, madam.

868
01:08:15,064 --> 01:08:17,390
Okay fine. Get your stuff.

869
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:19,060
Dada will discuss your rent.

870
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:20,267
He is my manager.

871
01:08:20,443 --> 01:08:22,415
Thank you.
Thank you. You are very good.

872
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:23,981
And even beautiful.

873
01:08:26,247 --> 01:08:28,175
Do you like me?

874
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:30,441
I have gone crazy after seeing you.

875
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:34,203
- Really?
- Yes. I am in love with you.

876
01:08:34,973 --> 01:08:36,080
Oh.

877
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:41,562
You son of Shakespeare.
What is this new drama?

878
01:08:41,734 --> 01:08:43,878
If that poor girl really
fell in love with me?

879
01:08:43,959 --> 01:08:45,107
Then go ahead.

880
01:09:08,613 --> 01:09:11,380
I can never avenge my parents' death.

881
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:13,801
Never.

882
01:09:20,133 --> 01:09:21,396
Now you will have milk.

883
01:09:21,638 --> 01:09:23,999
Now mother will make you drink milk.

884
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:28,002
Drink.

885
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:31,151
Oh.

886
01:09:32,492 --> 01:09:34,005
I have understood your trick.

887
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:35,285
Let me handle the baby.

888
01:09:35,365 --> 01:09:36,366
Take it. Feed it.

889
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:39,479
The madam will feed you.
The madam will feed you.

890
01:09:45,517 --> 01:09:46,451
I have come.

891
01:09:46,531 --> 01:09:49,331
- Look. I have come.
- Why have you come?

892
01:09:49,411 --> 01:09:52,921
- I have won 500.500.
- Wow.

893
01:09:53,102 --> 01:09:56,293
From now you are my god. My teacher.

894
01:09:56,373 --> 01:09:58,404
- You are everything to me.
- He is god.

895
01:09:58,845 --> 01:09:59,883
- Who?
- That.

896
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:01,958
Yes it is his kindness if you see.

897
01:10:02,123 --> 01:10:03,982
But from now, I am your slave.

898
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:05,911
Sir, tell me a number every day.

899
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:07,675
I will. But where are the sweets?

900
01:10:08,143 --> 01:10:10,058
- I forgot them.
- You did? So I forgot the number.

901
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,338
Don't forget the number.
Don't forget the number.

902
01:10:12,418 --> 01:10:13,639
- I will get the sweets now.
- Get them.

903
01:10:13,663 --> 01:10:15,140
I will get 5 kgs of sweets.

904
01:10:19,836 --> 01:10:23,962
Excellent. Excellent recovery. Renu.

905
01:10:24,213 --> 01:10:27,317
Renu dear.
Look, these are Raja's x-ray reports.

906
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,414
His hands have fully recovered. Look.

907
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:35,318
Daddy. Thank you, doctor.
Thank you very much.

908
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:38,396
- I will get some sweets for you.
- No, dear.

909
01:10:38,604 --> 01:10:41,250
I will now eat sweets at your wedding.
Okay. Bye.

910
01:10:41,614 --> 01:10:43,577
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

911
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,569
Daddy. Do you remember your promise?

912
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:48,956
Absolutely.
Can I ever forget a promise?

913
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:52,269
Daddy. Nobody has a daddy like you.

914
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:54,172
My darling.

915
01:11:15,925 --> 01:11:16,925
Hello, son.

916
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:22,878
Congratulations.

917
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:25,473
- Come let me introduce you to my friends.
- What?

918
01:11:25,776 --> 01:11:27,142
Yes. Yes. Why not?

919
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:34,294
I was thinking that am
I even eligible for your respect.

920
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:40,313
I told you that you
don't know your value.

921
01:11:40,953 --> 01:11:44,387
I know what you are and
what you are eligible for.

922
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,427
Come dear.

923
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,443
Ladies and gentlemen.

924
01:11:49,524 --> 01:11:52,006
This youth is not ordinary.

925
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:59,971
From now he is the owner
of my property, honour, everything.

926
01:12:03,749 --> 01:12:05,912
Stop. Stop. One more thing.

927
01:12:11,084 --> 01:12:13,557
I have more good news.

928
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:20,977
That my daughter Renu
and Raja will get married soon.

929
01:12:29,358 --> 01:12:30,707
Aren't you happy, Raja?

930
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:34,824
I am scared that it might be a dream.

931
01:12:35,844 --> 01:12:37,418
It's a beautiful dream.

932
01:12:38,283 --> 01:12:42,399
And if this reality than
it is a big test for me.

933
01:12:43,419 --> 01:12:44,431
Come.

934
01:12:52,102 --> 01:12:55,640
Let's start a new tune
on this new lease of life.

935
01:12:59,003 --> 01:13:07,003
"Today these hands
again have life and tune."

936
01:13:18,047 --> 01:13:24,222
"What can I say to you beauty?"

937
01:13:25,044 --> 01:13:30,294
"I am so proud of you."

938
01:13:32,456 --> 01:13:40,456
"Thanks for your love, my benefactor."

939
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:50,384
"Thanks for your love, my benefactor."

940
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:54,700
"My benefactor."

941
01:13:55,236 --> 01:13:58,323
"My benefactor."

942
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:27,997
"I have never thought that
life would be so beautiful, darling."

943
01:14:34,865 --> 01:14:42,865
"I have never thought that
life would be so beautiful, darling."

944
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:57,980
"Thanks for your love, my benefactor."

945
01:14:59,822 --> 01:15:07,822
"Thanks for your love, my benefactor."

946
01:15:08,568 --> 01:15:11,779
"My benefactor."

947
01:15:12,287 --> 01:15:15,347
"My benefactor."

948
01:15:29,336 --> 01:15:36,558
"I accept that life
is full of thorns."

949
01:15:36,882 --> 01:15:43,077
"But my story is full of flowers."

950
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:51,456
"I accept that life
is full of thorns."

951
01:15:51,683 --> 01:15:58,829
"But my story is full of flowers."

952
01:15:59,283 --> 01:16:07,283
"Thanks for your love, my benefactor."

953
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:17,001
"Thanks for your love, my benefactor."

954
01:16:17,671 --> 01:16:20,784
"My benefactor."

955
01:16:21,303 --> 01:16:24,503
"My benefactor."

956
01:16:45,736 --> 01:16:49,337
"I don't care about
the night with you."

957
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:52,796
"There is nothing to be scared of."

958
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:58,991
"My sky is full of stars."

959
01:17:00,396 --> 01:17:03,585
"I don't care about
the night with you."

960
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:07,466
"There is nothing to be scared of."

961
01:17:07,715 --> 01:17:14,699
"My sky is full of stars."

962
01:17:15,228 --> 01:17:23,228
"Thanks for your love, my benefactor."

963
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:32,201
"Thanks for your love, my benefactor."

964
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:37,033
"My benefactor."

965
01:17:37,113 --> 01:17:41,509
"My benefactor."

966
01:17:45,584 --> 01:17:47,108
I am dead.

967
01:17:52,664 --> 01:17:54,189
Driver, open the dicky.

968
01:17:55,702 --> 01:17:58,751
Be careful. They are smugglers.

969
01:17:59,032 --> 01:18:00,794
They have gold in their bags.

970
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:04,372
- Are you smugglers?
- What nonsense?

971
01:18:04,452 --> 01:18:06,577
I am not taking your stuff.
Engage a different taxi.

972
01:18:06,657 --> 01:18:08,221
- I am not coming.
- Why wouldn't you?

973
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:10,091
He is showing me the knife.
Tell me now.

974
01:18:10,382 --> 01:18:12,523
Don't be scared. The police is coming.

975
01:18:12,804 --> 01:18:14,631
- The police is coming.
- Police?

976
01:18:22,101 --> 01:18:24,144
Where are you going, Son?

977
01:18:24,224 --> 01:18:24,923
Got you. Catch them.

978
01:18:25,003 --> 01:18:26,750
Catch them. They are smugglers.

979
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:30,544
- What is your name?
- Sir, my name is Murli.

980
01:18:30,814 --> 01:18:32,641
- License no.?
- Sir, I don't know to read.

981
01:18:32,824 --> 01:18:34,997
- Read for yourself.
- Where do you stay?

982
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:37,451
In room no. 14 in that hovel.

983
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:38,824
You have done a good job.

984
01:18:38,904 --> 01:18:40,156
Even you have done a good job, sir.

985
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,441
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Go, sir. Thank you.

986
01:18:41,465 --> 01:18:43,624
- Come on. Put him in the jeep.
- Take them. - Come.

987
01:18:43,704 --> 01:18:45,451
Hey. Take this.

988
01:18:51,397 --> 01:18:53,645
You have done a brave thing.

989
01:18:53,725 --> 01:18:55,418
Now the government will reward you.

990
01:18:55,623 --> 01:18:57,355
Your photos will get
published in the newspaper.

991
01:18:57,379 --> 01:18:58,315
- Is it?
- Yes.

992
01:18:58,395 --> 01:19:02,456
But tell me, how did you
find out that they are smugglers?

993
01:19:03,623 --> 01:19:05,850
That is god's gift.

994
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,283
Kammo. Kammo.

995
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:12,034
- Raja you have come.
- Kammo. - Raja.

996
01:19:14,575 --> 01:19:17,634
All right. So Raja has not come alone.

997
01:19:18,024 --> 01:19:19,191
He has also got his mate.

998
01:19:19,418 --> 01:19:21,505
Witch, she is Renu.

999
01:19:21,743 --> 01:19:23,992
And Renu, this is my sister Kammo.

1000
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:33,852
Renu, this is my palace
where I had many dreams.

1001
01:19:35,787 --> 01:19:38,976
But I never imagined
that you would also..

1002
01:19:40,469 --> 01:19:41,798
Be part of my life one day.

1003
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:45,560
I am here now.
Will I get place at this house?

1004
01:19:45,734 --> 01:19:47,356
Why are you asking her?

1005
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:49,885
She is about the
leave this house soon.

1006
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,863
Right? Is everything fine?
How's your boy?

1007
01:20:00,526 --> 01:20:01,920
What is the matter, Kammo?

1008
01:20:02,893 --> 01:20:04,331
Why are you so sad suddenly?

1009
01:20:05,294 --> 01:20:08,018
- Where is uncle?
- At the club.

1010
01:20:08,797 --> 01:20:11,218
Nowadays he has become
enchanted by Jagga.

1011
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:16,105
He has put up a wall
between me and Sudhir.

1012
01:20:16,451 --> 01:20:18,818
Father is not conscious of anything.

1013
01:20:19,196 --> 01:20:23,131
Maybe he will not
even recognize you now.

1014
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:25,699
Jagga.

1015
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:32,645
Silence!

1016
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:39,002
Can't see my bottle is empty?

1017
01:20:40,116 --> 01:20:43,402
It doesn't have a drop to shed tears.

1018
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:46,710
So how can you laugh?

1019
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:48,527
Don't worry, Madan.

1020
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,121
So what if the bottle is empty?

1021
01:20:51,532 --> 01:20:52,991
Jaggu is still alive.

1022
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:55,748
So shall I drink you up Jaggu?

1023
01:20:56,645 --> 01:21:03,347
Jaggu, order for a bottle.
Lily. Bottle. Lilly, bottle.

1024
01:21:03,585 --> 01:21:05,034
Here's the problem.

1025
01:21:05,114 --> 01:21:06,991
That fool doesn't let
me sit for even a moment.

1026
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,077
Once I have made my fortune..

1027
01:21:09,157 --> 01:21:11,336
I will strangle them all peacefully.

1028
01:21:11,607 --> 01:21:12,947
When will you make your fortune..

1029
01:21:13,027 --> 01:21:15,023
And when I will
get rid of this dirt?

1030
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:18,871
- Brother.
- I have told you not to call me brother.

1031
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:22,061
Call me milkman.
Address me as Ram Khilawan.

1032
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:25,888
- Brother.
- Can't you elope with me? - What?

1033
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:29,693
Is there no place on earth
where we can go and hide?

1034
01:21:29,773 --> 01:21:32,698
My queen,
I will take you around the world.

1035
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:35,131
Just let me make my fortune once.

1036
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:38,061
- Lily, get a bottle fast.
- Drat him.

1037
01:21:38,612 --> 01:21:41,336
Okay bye. I had my love.

1038
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,656
Take this. You won't get anymore.

1039
01:21:53,845 --> 01:21:56,418
Why not? Doesn't Jagga pay?

1040
01:21:56,498 --> 01:21:57,921
Do you give it for free?

1041
01:21:58,001 --> 01:21:59,024
I don't give it for free.

1042
01:21:59,104 --> 01:22:01,597
- But you are getting sold to Jagga for free.
- Lily!

1043
01:22:01,677 --> 01:22:04,365
Don't glare at me.
I know what you are planning.

1044
01:22:04,445 --> 01:22:06,916
- Cheat.
- Jagga.

1045
01:22:08,137 --> 01:22:09,932
Why did he call you a cheat?

1046
01:22:10,473 --> 01:22:12,235
Are you cheating me?

1047
01:22:13,164 --> 01:22:15,975
Have you diluted my drink?
I am not getting a high.

1048
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:18,656
Have patience, Madan.

1049
01:23:01,706 --> 01:23:03,749
Uncle. Uncle.

1050
01:23:04,614 --> 01:23:06,463
How can you call me uncle?

1051
01:23:07,371 --> 01:23:09,349
We are not related.

1052
01:23:09,803 --> 01:23:12,430
I don't have anything
to do with the man..

1053
01:23:12,744 --> 01:23:16,960
Who has forgotten his reality.
No reality. Lily!

1054
01:23:17,469 --> 01:23:21,879
- Get more alcohol.
- Yes, Lily. Get alcohol.

1055
01:23:22,615 --> 01:23:24,150
Let him drown in alcohol.

1056
01:23:25,858 --> 01:23:29,058
Uncle, you are not having alcohol..

1057
01:23:29,436 --> 01:23:31,987
But the blood of your
daughter's dreams. Blood.

1058
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:33,933
- Raja!
- Raja is dead!

1059
01:23:34,355 --> 01:23:37,923
If he was alive Kammo
wouldn't be in tears today.

1060
01:23:38,003 --> 01:23:40,096
You remember Kammo's tears.

1061
01:23:41,544 --> 01:23:43,566
But you forgot your oath.

1062
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:48,095
You forgot the day when your father..

1063
01:23:48,175 --> 01:23:50,397
Committed suicide in the sea.

1064
01:23:51,381 --> 01:23:55,716
Your mother had begged
for the revenge from the sky.

1065
01:23:57,446 --> 01:23:59,770
Revenge, Raja. Revenge.

1066
01:24:01,889 --> 01:24:03,899
Raja, you have changed so much.

1067
01:24:05,099 --> 01:24:07,370
How will you avenge
your parents' death?

1068
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:08,776
How will you take revenge?

1069
01:24:10,396 --> 01:24:12,278
Raja has not changed, uncle.

1070
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:14,353
The world has changed.

1071
01:24:14,721 --> 01:24:17,618
Money is the most powerful
thing in the world.

1072
01:24:18,267 --> 01:24:20,170
Today I have that.

1073
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:25,348
I will look far and
wide for my parents' killer.

1074
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:28,700
And then I will get him to you and..

1075
01:24:29,046 --> 01:24:31,424
Ask you to recognize him.
Is he the one?

1076
01:24:31,856 --> 01:24:34,094
I will torment him to death.

1077
01:24:34,267 --> 01:24:36,916
I will get finished but
I will not end my wrath, uncle.

1078
01:24:36,996 --> 01:24:39,099
- Raja.
- Yes, uncle. Yes.

1079
01:24:41,402 --> 01:24:44,127
He is there. There.

1080
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:03,706
- Hi. - Raja.
- Kammo.

1081
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,414
- How are you?
- Fine.

1082
01:25:05,739 --> 01:25:06,809
Congratulations, Raja.

1083
01:25:06,889 --> 01:25:09,717
So Raja had got his queen at last.

1084
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:13,165
Look sister-in-law,
we poor people have..

1085
01:25:13,381 --> 01:25:15,230
Turned the settlement
into a bride like you.

1086
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,338
- Congratulations, Raja.
- Sudhir.

1087
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:21,403
- Renu, this is Sudhir.
- Hello.

1088
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:25,317
I am married.
Now soon they will get married too.

1089
01:25:25,997 --> 01:25:30,408
- Father.
- Bless you. Bless you.

1090
01:25:30,488 --> 01:25:34,581
Renu, this is my uncle.
He is everything to me.

1091
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:36,084
Bless you, dear. Bless you.

1092
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:42,473
People say that it is a waste
to dream of palaces from huts.

1093
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:48,106
But my Raja' true love
has even achieved that.

1094
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:49,511
Not only that, uncle.

1095
01:25:49,695 --> 01:25:53,684
Our Raja has got
the palace into the hut.

1096
01:25:54,311 --> 01:25:57,079
Wow Raja.
I swear what a beautiful bride.

1097
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:59,317
The entire settlement has got bright.

1098
01:25:59,533 --> 01:26:02,452
- God, be kind on me too.
- Don't worry, bro.

1099
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:03,772
He will answer our prayers too.

1100
01:26:03,797 --> 01:26:06,052
Even we will get married.

1101
01:26:48,474 --> 01:26:50,388
"He has done it."

1102
01:26:50,468 --> 01:26:52,345
"He has done it."

1103
01:26:52,425 --> 01:26:54,301
"He has done it."

1104
01:26:54,474 --> 01:26:56,301
"He has done it."

1105
01:26:56,712 --> 01:27:00,301
"Everyone has got married."

1106
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:03,987
"I am the only poor
one left to be destroyed."

1107
01:27:04,067 --> 01:27:07,955
"Have pity on me someone."

1108
01:27:08,035 --> 01:27:12,214
"Have pity on me someone."

1109
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:14,344
"Shall I come?"

1110
01:27:14,712 --> 01:27:16,366
"Shall I come?"

1111
01:27:16,446 --> 01:27:18,668
"Oh no."

1112
01:27:39,057 --> 01:27:43,814
"Everyone gets readymade
food but I have to cook for myself."

1113
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:48,938
"Everyone gets readymade
food but I have to cook for myself."

1114
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,327
"Friends, make me a bridegroom too."

1115
01:27:57,348 --> 01:28:01,187
"I have hit middle age now."

1116
01:28:01,267 --> 01:28:05,176
"Come and get hitched to me someone."

1117
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:09,165
"In my desolate house."

1118
01:28:09,245 --> 01:28:12,581
"My desolate house
will also become grand."

1119
01:28:12,661 --> 01:28:16,570
"Have pity on me someone."

1120
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:20,624
"Have pity on me someone."

1121
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:22,883
"Shall I come?"

1122
01:28:22,963 --> 01:28:25,326
"Tell me. Shall I come?"

1123
01:28:25,406 --> 01:28:27,251
"Oh no. No."

1124
01:28:45,598 --> 01:28:50,928
"Dress from Bikaner
and bangles from Delhi."

1125
01:28:51,522 --> 01:28:55,695
"Dress from Bikaner
and bangles from Delhi."

1126
01:28:55,775 --> 01:29:00,916
"Don't ask me when the
girl will walk in my courtyard."

1127
01:29:03,965 --> 01:29:07,933
"My neighbors will
look enviously at me."

1128
01:29:08,013 --> 01:29:11,878
"And my darling will
sing songs of love."

1129
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:15,932
"I get a dowry of utensils."

1130
01:29:16,012 --> 01:29:19,446
"I get a dowry of
utensils from Morardabad."

1131
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:23,403
"Have pity on me someone."

1132
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:27,716
"Have pity on me someone."

1133
01:29:28,105 --> 01:29:29,705
"Shall I come?"

1134
01:29:29,785 --> 01:29:31,953
"Tell me. Shall I come?"

1135
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,061
"Oh no. No."

1136
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,629
"Brother, anyone will do for.
Fair or dark."

1137
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:05,013
"Brother, anyone will do for.
Fair or dark."

1138
01:30:05,093 --> 01:30:09,208
"Just take care that the
girl should have attitude."

1139
01:30:09,381 --> 01:30:11,749
"Be careful."

1140
01:30:13,252 --> 01:30:17,273
"It would be wonderful
if she has pretty eyes."

1141
01:30:17,353 --> 01:30:21,133
"I will leave my business
and stay at home."

1142
01:30:21,436 --> 01:30:25,273
"And I will continue to increase."

1143
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:28,721
"And I will continue to
increase India's population."

1144
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:32,721
"Have pity on me someone."

1145
01:30:32,905 --> 01:30:37,240
"Have pity on me someone."

1146
01:30:37,553 --> 01:30:39,142
"Shall I come?"

1147
01:30:39,222 --> 01:30:41,239
"Shall I come? Tell me."

1148
01:30:41,319 --> 01:30:42,883
"Oh no. No."

1149
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:18,611
Today I miss your sweet dog a lot.

1150
01:31:19,995 --> 01:31:23,011
What hair. Wow.

1151
01:31:23,638 --> 01:31:26,082
What eyes. Wow.

1152
01:31:27,032 --> 01:31:30,319
What a beautiful smile. Wow.

1153
01:31:31,173 --> 01:31:32,254
You remember the dog.

1154
01:31:32,816 --> 01:31:35,768
But did you forget the
donkey below the bridge?

1155
01:31:37,886 --> 01:31:42,935
That same donkey
is today at your feet.

1156
01:31:45,822 --> 01:31:47,951
What are you doing?
If someone sees us?

1157
01:31:48,243 --> 01:31:50,449
Do you think nobody is watching us?

1158
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,735
Who is watching?

1159
01:31:52,016 --> 01:31:58,784
The walls.
The roof. The door. The lantern.

1160
01:32:00,113 --> 01:32:01,205
Doing shut down.

1161
01:32:05,474 --> 01:32:06,901
I am scared.

1162
01:32:07,399 --> 01:32:09,983
Of what? Me?

1163
01:32:11,258 --> 01:32:12,502
Turn off the lights.

1164
01:32:13,085 --> 01:32:17,021
If it is dark I will get scared.

1165
01:32:17,594 --> 01:32:18,978
You are very cunning.

1166
01:32:22,437 --> 01:32:24,945
Tell me one thing. Are you happy here?

1167
01:32:25,929 --> 01:32:28,296
A lot. Really Raja.

1168
01:32:28,837 --> 01:32:31,313
Today for the first
time I have realized..

1169
01:32:31,917 --> 01:32:34,036
The difference
between palace and hut.

1170
01:32:35,463 --> 01:32:37,063
There is so much happiness here.

1171
01:32:37,582 --> 01:32:39,182
So much peace.

1172
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:43,041
These people love you so much.

1173
01:32:44,177 --> 01:32:47,744
And how much I love you.

1174
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,495
Do I need to tell you that?

1175
01:32:49,722 --> 01:32:51,051
There is no need.

1176
01:32:51,538 --> 01:32:56,132
- There is need.
- No.

1177
01:33:07,117 --> 01:33:10,641
Wow. You have become
better after marriage.

1178
01:33:11,442 --> 01:33:14,166
Do you remember when
you forgot to greet me?

1179
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:15,679
Grandma.

1180
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:18,112
Today you have understood it and..

1181
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:19,982
That is all because of my daughter.

1182
01:33:20,062 --> 01:33:23,766
Grandma,
are you going to bless or not?

1183
01:33:24,025 --> 01:33:26,706
Bless you, my dear.
What else can I give?

1184
01:33:27,614 --> 01:33:30,198
This thief has already
stolen the most precious thing.

1185
01:33:31,074 --> 01:33:34,220
Still I do have a wedding gift.

1186
01:33:34,533 --> 01:33:36,587
What have you got? Tell me, grandma.

1187
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:38,209
Please grandma.

1188
01:33:38,289 --> 01:33:43,257
I have got my love for you.
And for Raja.

1189
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:46,835
- Raja. Close your eyes.
- What?

1190
01:33:47,095 --> 01:33:49,754
- Close them.
- Here you are.

1191
01:33:55,473 --> 01:33:57,106
Now open your eyes.

1192
01:34:00,165 --> 01:34:03,441
This is a small gift from me.
Here. Accept it.

1193
01:34:07,593 --> 01:34:08,987
Grandma!

1194
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:12,512
Dear, these diamonds
are an ancestral heirloom.

1195
01:34:13,733 --> 01:34:15,344
Now you are the heir of our family.

1196
01:34:16,544 --> 01:34:19,506
You are more precious
to us than these diamonds.

1197
01:34:19,906 --> 01:34:22,695
Grandma,
you don't know what I am feeling.

1198
01:34:24,522 --> 01:34:26,857
I had yearned for mother's
love since childhood.

1199
01:34:28,392 --> 01:34:30,132
You gave me everything.

1200
01:34:30,911 --> 01:34:33,743
A mother's love. A mother's affection.

1201
01:34:34,175 --> 01:34:36,046
A few things are still left, Raja.

1202
01:34:43,701 --> 01:34:47,247
These are the documents
of my entire property.

1203
01:34:48,306 --> 01:34:49,539
For you and Renu.

1204
01:34:51,355 --> 01:34:53,225
Mother was right, dear.

1205
01:34:54,047 --> 01:34:55,982
Now you are the heir of our family.

1206
01:34:58,003 --> 01:35:01,830
Raja, there are few people in world..

1207
01:35:03,095 --> 01:35:05,030
Whose all wishes are fulfilled.

1208
01:35:07,215 --> 01:35:10,717
Do you have any other desire left?

1209
01:35:11,312 --> 01:35:12,566
Desire?

1210
01:35:15,993 --> 01:35:17,398
I have just got one desire left.

1211
01:35:26,133 --> 01:35:28,868
Boss. My hands are fully recovered.

1212
01:35:29,852 --> 01:35:30,944
Look.

1213
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,625
Out. Out.

1214
01:35:46,846 --> 01:35:51,149
I need to settle old
dues with him in private.

1215
01:35:51,646 --> 01:35:53,603
Come Raja. Will you have something?

1216
01:35:54,522 --> 01:35:55,762
I haven't come here to do that.

1217
01:35:57,192 --> 01:35:58,552
I have come to give you something.

1218
01:36:06,608 --> 01:36:09,289
Raja. Well done, Raja.

1219
01:36:09,798 --> 01:36:13,495
I knew that my Raja
can never lose in life.

1220
01:36:15,765 --> 01:36:17,289
What a loot.

1221
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,376
Aren't these the same hands boss..

1222
01:36:21,549 --> 01:36:23,765
Which had made my hands useless?

1223
01:36:26,554 --> 01:36:28,792
Forgive me, Raja. Forgive me.

1224
01:36:28,987 --> 01:36:31,127
I was sorry even that day.

1225
01:36:33,635 --> 01:36:36,446
I don't to be sorry alter, boss.

1226
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:40,543
These hands have ruined so many lives.

1227
01:36:41,884 --> 01:36:44,857
These fingers might have made..

1228
01:36:44,937 --> 01:36:46,846
So many helpless people dance.

1229
01:36:56,826 --> 01:36:57,826
Boss.

1230
01:36:57,885 --> 01:37:00,177
Today the way I have your hands..

1231
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:04,069
In the same way
I even have your life.

1232
01:37:04,149 --> 01:37:07,377
Raja, just give me one more chance.

1233
01:37:08,977 --> 01:37:11,020
Today I have come to buy your club.

1234
01:37:12,015 --> 01:37:14,318
Make you my slave.

1235
01:37:15,161 --> 01:37:16,642
Your boss.

1236
01:37:19,172 --> 01:37:20,199
What's your price?

1237
01:37:20,761 --> 01:37:22,685
One lakh? 2 lakhs?

1238
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,707
- 3 lakhs?
- Raja.

1239
01:37:28,328 --> 01:37:29,518
Here is the check.

1240
01:37:29,809 --> 01:37:33,593
And collect all card players
in this club within 3 days.

1241
01:37:33,873 --> 01:37:35,117
Make it a big game.

1242
01:37:37,063 --> 01:37:38,619
Now I will search for that man..

1243
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:40,728
Whom I have been waiting
to defeat since long.

1244
01:37:40,912 --> 01:37:42,663
Of course, why not?

1245
01:37:42,922 --> 01:37:44,447
But who will recognize him?

1246
01:37:44,934 --> 01:37:47,507
There is one person
who will recognize him.

1247
01:37:57,993 --> 01:38:00,469
Uncle. Anyone among them?

1248
01:38:01,248 --> 01:38:06,048
No Raja. He is not among them.

1249
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:09,269
Oh.

1250
01:38:10,664 --> 01:38:12,686
It's been 20 years.

1251
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:16,351
Maybe that man is dead.

1252
01:38:16,751 --> 01:38:18,719
He is surely alive, uncle.

1253
01:38:19,184 --> 01:38:23,108
He will stay alive till
my heart is in torment.

1254
01:38:24,081 --> 01:38:27,551
By the way Raja,
you have got a wrong way.

1255
01:38:28,817 --> 01:38:31,022
You have got so much money.

1256
01:38:31,703 --> 01:38:37,108
Raja, whenever I see you,
I feel very proud.

1257
01:38:38,201 --> 01:38:40,222
This is all because of Renu's daddy.

1258
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:43,131
He has done a huge favor on me.

1259
01:38:44,828 --> 01:38:48,007
If he had not supported I would have..

1260
01:38:48,087 --> 01:38:50,288
Spent my entire
life in dirty hovels.

1261
01:38:51,876 --> 01:38:56,341
Really uncle.
He is not a man. He is a Demi god.

1262
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:07,012
But Raja,
you have never introduced me to him.

1263
01:39:08,364 --> 01:39:09,585
He is a very busy man.

1264
01:39:10,255 --> 01:39:13,715
He has a large business.
It's a shipping company.

1265
01:39:14,331 --> 01:39:16,245
He has mills, factories.

1266
01:39:16,795 --> 01:39:18,968
And he has handed them all over to me.

1267
01:39:23,173 --> 01:39:24,395
Welcome.

1268
01:39:25,779 --> 01:39:26,806
He has come.

1269
01:39:27,627 --> 01:39:28,881
Raja. He has come.

1270
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:34,524
He is the one.

1271
01:39:40,265 --> 01:39:41,929
He is that scoundrel.

1272
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:47,238
He is the cheat. Raja, he is the one.

1273
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:49,443
Uncle. What is this joke?

1274
01:39:49,767 --> 01:39:52,007
This is not the tome for jokes.
Tell me that it is a lie.

1275
01:39:52,124 --> 01:39:53,284
Tell me, you had been fooled.

1276
01:39:53,334 --> 01:39:54,275
Tell me that it is not him.

1277
01:39:54,355 --> 01:39:56,005
No, Raja, no.

1278
01:39:57,032 --> 01:40:00,005
My old eyes which
has looked for a face..

1279
01:40:00,924 --> 01:40:02,364
My entire life cannot be cheated.

1280
01:40:03,238 --> 01:40:06,362
- I cannot mistake, Raja. He is the one.
- Uncle.

1281
01:40:07,173 --> 01:40:08,427
He is Renu's father.

1282
01:40:25,844 --> 01:40:28,255
I told you this was bound to happen.

1283
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:39,509
Hello Raja.

1284
01:40:40,742 --> 01:40:42,580
Wow. Congratulations, son.

1285
01:40:43,023 --> 01:40:45,034
You have bought a grand club.

1286
01:40:46,104 --> 01:40:49,682
- There is blood on your mouth.
- What? Oh!

1287
01:40:49,762 --> 01:40:52,028
Raja, this is not
blood but tomato sauce.

1288
01:40:52,108 --> 01:40:53,282
It's tomato sauce.

1289
01:41:14,817 --> 01:41:18,569
"Tonight is the night of decision."

1290
01:41:19,952 --> 01:41:22,373
"Tonight is important."

1291
01:41:24,838 --> 01:41:27,141
"You can commit any crimes you want."

1292
01:41:27,778 --> 01:41:31,043
"No one will count them today."

1293
01:41:53,767 --> 01:41:57,864
"No less than alcohol."

1294
01:41:58,405 --> 01:42:02,275
"Is the delicateness of wine."

1295
01:42:03,021 --> 01:42:07,075
"This fun breeze."

1296
01:42:07,626 --> 01:42:11,962
"Just look at it."

1297
01:42:12,178 --> 01:42:16,210
"No less than alcohol."

1298
01:42:35,734 --> 01:42:40,188
"Where we have gone
in the throes of love?"

1299
01:42:40,371 --> 01:42:44,750
"The lovers lost their
hearts in every step of mine."

1300
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:51,734
"Where we have gone
in the throes of love?"

1301
01:42:51,929 --> 01:42:56,177
"The lovers lost their
hearts in every step of mine."

1302
01:42:56,523 --> 01:43:00,588
"The way they swayed in intoxication."

1303
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:04,955
"Several youths slipped here."

1304
01:43:05,035 --> 01:43:09,247
"No less than alcohol."

1305
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:13,538
"Is the delicateness of wine."

1306
01:43:14,381 --> 01:43:18,046
"This fun breeze."

1307
01:43:18,921 --> 01:43:23,245
"Just look at it."

1308
01:43:23,494 --> 01:43:27,699
"No less than alcohol."

1309
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:55,050
"My love without love is
like a garden without spring."

1310
01:43:58,682 --> 01:44:06,682
"My love without love is
like a garden without spring."

1311
01:44:07,882 --> 01:44:12,055
"Or a flower which is not fragrant."

1312
01:44:12,304 --> 01:44:16,402
"Or a bride without her make up."

1313
01:44:16,482 --> 01:44:18,391
"No less than..."

1314
01:44:21,234 --> 01:44:24,964
"Is the delicateness of..."

1315
01:44:25,743 --> 01:44:29,483
"This fun breeze."

1316
01:44:30,283 --> 01:44:34,770
"Just look at it."

1317
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:39,365
"No less than alcohol."

1318
01:44:58,231 --> 01:45:02,782
"Where will you find such
assemblies of hearts again?"

1319
01:45:02,862 --> 01:45:07,345
"There is beauty, wine and love here."

1320
01:45:09,778 --> 01:45:14,232
"Where will you find such
assemblies of hearts again?"

1321
01:45:14,415 --> 01:45:18,631
"There is beauty, wine and love here."

1322
01:45:18,977 --> 01:45:23,215
"One can get intoxicated
here as much as they."

1323
01:45:23,561 --> 01:45:27,442
"All your errors are forgiven here."

1324
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:31,539
"No less than alcohol."

1325
01:45:32,328 --> 01:45:36,101
"Is the delicateness of wine."

1326
01:45:36,825 --> 01:45:40,663
"This fun breeze."

1327
01:45:41,464 --> 01:45:45,766
"Just look at it."

1328
01:45:45,961 --> 01:45:49,539
"No less than alcohol."

1329
01:46:30,047 --> 01:46:31,333
Alcohol.

1330
01:46:33,431 --> 01:46:34,620
Very old.

1331
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:36,382
What do you want?

1332
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,393
You have raised Raja with
great love since childhood.

1333
01:46:41,745 --> 01:46:45,345
So why has he hit you today?

1334
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:50,264
Ratanlal, clean your intentions
before cleaning glasses.

1335
01:46:51,377 --> 01:46:53,161
I don't drink alcohol for free.

1336
01:46:55,237 --> 01:46:56,285
Look.

1337
01:46:57,247 --> 01:47:01,939
Only you recognize the
man Raja is looking for.

1338
01:47:03,464 --> 01:47:09,798
If you make a part of this
secret than your world will change.

1339
01:47:11,193 --> 01:47:12,934
But my intention won't change.

1340
01:47:24,868 --> 01:47:27,355
Why did you leave me
alone in the dark, Raja?

1341
01:47:27,582 --> 01:47:28,966
What are you doing here?

1342
01:47:30,404 --> 01:47:33,334
Weighing myself in
the scales of destiny.

1343
01:47:37,745 --> 01:47:41,009
You look worried.
I am sure you have some problem.

1344
01:47:42,297 --> 01:47:43,648
Yes, Renu.

1345
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,810
I am really in a problem.

1346
01:47:48,859 --> 01:47:52,286
Won't you tell me?
Don't I have any rights over you?

1347
01:47:56,222 --> 01:47:57,713
Want to hear a story?

1348
01:47:57,995 --> 01:48:00,686
Story? Since when have
you started writing stories?

1349
01:48:01,476 --> 01:48:04,212
Every person's life is a story.

1350
01:48:05,671 --> 01:48:12,699
The story of a person
which has confused me is...

1351
01:48:14,526 --> 01:48:16,137
Tell me that story.

1352
01:48:16,217 --> 01:48:17,975
Maybe I will be able to help you.

1353
01:48:21,824 --> 01:48:24,743
Here. I will tell you the story.

1354
01:48:26,473 --> 01:48:28,516
Write the end of this story yourself.

1355
01:48:29,954 --> 01:48:33,111
Your decision will
get rid of my problem.

1356
01:48:34,355 --> 01:48:36,409
Do you trust my decision so much?

1357
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:40,376
I have risked my
life on your decision.

1358
01:48:41,036 --> 01:48:42,036
Then tell me.

1359
01:48:46,063 --> 01:48:47,177
Tell me.

1360
01:48:49,328 --> 01:48:51,522
The story is of an unlucky child..

1361
01:48:52,863 --> 01:48:54,744
Whose parents had committed suicide.

1362
01:48:55,815 --> 01:49:00,832
Or you can say that they
were forced to kill themselves.

1363
01:49:01,891 --> 01:49:05,415
A thug betrayed them. Cheated them.

1364
01:49:07,015 --> 01:49:09,653
The parents committed
suicide in the sea.

1365
01:49:10,464 --> 01:49:13,891
But they left a spark of
revenge in their son's heart.

1366
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:15,540
Then?

1367
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:19,081
When the boy grew up he
had only one fire in his heart.

1368
01:49:19,161 --> 01:49:20,616
Just one goal.

1369
01:49:20,696 --> 01:49:24,108
As to how to find the
thug who took away his parents.

1370
01:49:24,432 --> 01:49:27,091
And left him alone in the world.

1371
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:29,427
Did that youth find that person?

1372
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:30,702
Yes.

1373
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:35,394
But the circumstances
are such that the youth..

1374
01:49:35,474 --> 01:49:37,210
Is now burdened by his favors.

1375
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:40,356
He had sold himself
to that man unknowingly.

1376
01:49:40,605 --> 01:49:44,237
That is the problem
and hence the decision.

1377
01:49:47,047 --> 01:49:48,777
Think and then decide, Renu.

1378
01:49:49,804 --> 01:49:51,793
It is a matter of life and death.

1379
01:49:52,464 --> 01:49:55,437
Emotions don't matter
in justice, Raja.

1380
01:49:55,517 --> 01:49:57,718
Such a person should be destroyed.

1381
01:49:57,967 --> 01:49:59,892
He should be cut into pieces.

1382
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:01,827
Even if that person is your husband?

1383
01:50:02,508 --> 01:50:04,465
Even if that person is my father.

1384
01:50:07,372 --> 01:50:10,940
Ganga. Ganga. Ganga.

1385
01:50:11,232 --> 01:50:12,962
What are you shouting?

1386
01:50:14,011 --> 01:50:14,908
Have you made your fortune?

1387
01:50:14,988 --> 01:50:17,719
I haven't made a fortune but lost it.

1388
01:50:18,054 --> 01:50:21,481
- What?
- Yes. The police is looking for Murli.

1389
01:50:22,476 --> 01:50:25,665
- Why?
- Look, his photo is printed in the newspaper.

1390
01:50:26,302 --> 01:50:27,557
- It is him.
- Right?

1391
01:50:27,762 --> 01:50:29,730
When is your photo
printed in the newspaper?

1392
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:31,816
- Who's?
- Of dacoits and thieves.

1393
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:33,589
- Dacoits?
- Yes.

1394
01:50:33,838 --> 01:50:34,908
- Thieves?
- Yes.

1395
01:50:36,281 --> 01:50:38,021
- Cry.
- What will happen to me now?

1396
01:50:38,101 --> 01:50:40,519
I told you he is a taxi driver.

1397
01:50:40,747 --> 01:50:42,984
But you didn't agree.
Go ahead, fall in love.

1398
01:50:43,064 --> 01:50:44,163
Why is the baby crying?

1399
01:50:44,455 --> 01:50:46,293
Not the baby.
The baby's mother is crying.

1400
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:49,914
Are you a thief?
A dacoit? Who are you?

1401
01:50:50,131 --> 01:50:52,034
What thief? Dacoit? I am Murli.

1402
01:50:52,114 --> 01:50:55,050
If you are Murli than why
is your photo in the newspaper.

1403
01:50:55,130 --> 01:50:56,130
Yes, tell me.

1404
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,428
The newspaper prints the
photos of thieves. Dacoits.

1405
01:50:59,634 --> 01:51:02,845
- And leaders.
- Are you a leader?

1406
01:51:02,925 --> 01:51:04,436
You don't require
time to become a leader.

1407
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:07,018
Just tilt your cap
and you become a leader.

1408
01:51:07,256 --> 01:51:10,337
- Is that the case?
- Who is Murli?

1409
01:51:12,531 --> 01:51:13,723
- Whose name is Murli?
- His name is Murli.

1410
01:51:13,747 --> 01:51:14,975
No, he is Murli.

1411
01:51:15,055 --> 01:51:16,673
Sir has called you
to the police station.

1412
01:51:16,910 --> 01:51:18,327
- Why?
- What why?

1413
01:51:18,407 --> 01:51:21,948
- They will take care of you there. Come on.
- Come.

1414
01:51:29,414 --> 01:51:31,619
Sir here is taxi driver Murli.

1415
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:34,863
- Go and lock that thug. Go.
- Not him. Him.

1416
01:51:35,652 --> 01:51:36,652
Him. Him.

1417
01:51:37,771 --> 01:51:39,274
So you are the brave man?

1418
01:51:39,354 --> 01:51:41,392
I am not brave. I am Murli.

1419
01:51:41,472 --> 01:51:43,381
There is another taxi
driver who is brave.

1420
01:51:43,461 --> 01:51:45,976
I knew I was arrested by mistake.

1421
01:51:46,056 --> 01:51:48,496
We haven't arrested you.
We have called you here to honor you.

1422
01:51:49,501 --> 01:51:51,425
You had these smugglers
arrested, right?

1423
01:51:51,641 --> 01:51:54,474
No, sir. I haven't.
I haven't committed that mistake.

1424
01:51:54,554 --> 01:51:55,634
The police are responsible.

1425
01:51:55,727 --> 01:51:56,884
You seem to be scared.

1426
01:51:57,154 --> 01:51:58,172
Sir, this is such a place.

1427
01:51:58,196 --> 01:51:59,996
I am bound to be scared
in the police station.

1428
01:52:00,067 --> 01:52:01,900
- Sir, okay. Bye.
- No. Sit here.

1429
01:52:02,322 --> 01:52:04,030
- On the chair?
- Yes, on the chair.

1430
01:52:04,246 --> 01:52:07,219
Sir, no one can sit on
a chair in front of the police.

1431
01:52:07,825 --> 01:52:08,874
Don't be scared. Sit here.

1432
01:52:09,198 --> 01:52:10,571
Sir, what crime have I committed..

1433
01:52:10,651 --> 01:52:11,946
That I need to sit on this chair?

1434
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:14,517
No Murli. We have called
you to give you a reward.

1435
01:52:14,916 --> 01:52:16,387
You have done a very good job.

1436
01:52:16,467 --> 01:52:17,868
Here is a reward of 500 rupees.

1437
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:20,235
No, sir. I don't want smuggled goods.

1438
01:52:20,315 --> 01:52:21,122
It is not smuggled goods.

1439
01:52:21,202 --> 01:52:22,216
This is from the government.

1440
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,922
Is this the ploy of the government?

1441
01:52:24,095 --> 01:52:25,273
- Take this.
- Thank you.

1442
01:52:25,446 --> 01:52:26,700
Murli, you are very simple.

1443
01:52:26,906 --> 01:52:28,419
Come, let us have a photo.

1444
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:32,506
Photographer, click a photo.

1445
01:52:32,586 --> 01:52:33,306
Yes, sir.

1446
01:52:33,386 --> 01:52:35,122
- Sir, may I pose in too?
- Come on.

1447
01:52:39,738 --> 01:52:40,754
Ready?

1448
01:52:43,781 --> 01:52:44,949
Mr. Galaxo.

1449
01:52:45,154 --> 01:52:47,392
Your father has become
Murlidhar from Murli.

1450
01:52:47,673 --> 01:52:48,929
Now when you will grow
up I will get you admitted..

1451
01:52:48,953 --> 01:52:49,781
To the best college.

1452
01:52:49,861 --> 01:52:51,392
Get you married grandly.

1453
01:52:51,472 --> 01:52:54,820
And then you will have
great kids just like you.

1454
01:52:55,555 --> 01:52:57,198
Where is my son?

1455
01:52:57,414 --> 01:52:58,884
With his parents.

1456
01:53:03,036 --> 01:53:03,976
Who are they?

1457
01:53:04,056 --> 01:53:05,511
You didn't recognize me.

1458
01:53:05,591 --> 01:53:07,857
I had left my baby in your taxi.

1459
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:11,457
This is my husband.
We were not married then.

1460
01:53:11,987 --> 01:53:14,106
Now I have come to get back my child.

1461
01:53:14,538 --> 01:53:15,565
Take him back?

1462
01:53:15,781 --> 01:53:17,933
Yes, when we saw your
photo in the paper..

1463
01:53:18,106 --> 01:53:19,266
We found out your address.

1464
01:53:19,435 --> 01:53:20,798
You are really a great man.

1465
01:53:21,382 --> 01:53:24,247
Brother you have taken
such good care of my baby.

1466
01:53:24,327 --> 01:53:26,571
I am now indebted to you for life.

1467
01:53:26,809 --> 01:53:28,538
I didn't look after your child.

1468
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:30,398
I took care of my child.

1469
01:53:30,582 --> 01:53:32,258
You had left it in the hands of god.

1470
01:53:32,485 --> 01:53:34,204
And god gave him to me.

1471
01:53:34,284 --> 01:53:35,555
So can he be your child?

1472
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:37,058
I will never give him to you.

1473
01:53:37,804 --> 01:53:40,010
I am not separating you from the baby.

1474
01:53:40,507 --> 01:53:43,285
Without you he would
even have been alive today.

1475
01:53:44,464 --> 01:53:46,420
But even I am a mother.

1476
01:53:46,615 --> 01:53:48,961
Even I yearn for my baby.

1477
01:53:49,523 --> 01:53:52,031
If you want you can keep it with you.

1478
01:53:52,345 --> 01:53:55,783
I will come sometimes and look at him.

1479
01:53:58,821 --> 01:54:01,146
You want to repay my favor with yours.

1480
01:54:02,941 --> 01:54:05,535
Still how can I separate
a mother from her baby?

1481
01:54:07,795 --> 01:54:09,330
Take away son.

1482
01:54:10,346 --> 01:54:12,357
Allow me to meet him sometimes.

1483
01:54:24,519 --> 01:54:25,968
Are you Madan Lal's daughter?

1484
01:54:29,395 --> 01:54:32,227
You are good. Where is Madanlal?

1485
01:54:34,595 --> 01:54:35,595
What is the matter?

1486
01:54:36,292 --> 01:54:38,249
Will you ask me
everything at the door?

1487
01:54:38,833 --> 01:54:41,827
It is a private matter
better keep it private.

1488
01:55:03,753 --> 01:55:04,877
What do you think?

1489
01:55:05,947 --> 01:55:08,477
No temptation of yours can by me.

1490
01:55:10,056 --> 01:55:13,008
It is better if you leave.

1491
01:55:13,862 --> 01:55:15,743
And don't dare to come here again.

1492
01:55:17,786 --> 01:55:19,915
I am helpless, Madanlal.

1493
01:55:20,953 --> 01:55:23,375
Otherwise I never approach anyone.

1494
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:31,526
And when I do I neither
go now return empty handed.

1495
01:55:36,759 --> 01:55:38,002
This is the one.

1496
01:55:39,029 --> 01:55:40,651
Several years old.

1497
01:55:41,872 --> 01:55:46,553
I will open it while
you spill the beans.

1498
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:51,116
Take this.

1499
01:56:08,717 --> 01:56:09,917
I have left drinking.

1500
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:16,847
Drinks have insulted me enough.

1501
01:56:19,117 --> 01:56:24,220
Now leave before I insult you.

1502
01:56:24,803 --> 01:56:28,079
You have mistaken to
recognize me again, Madanlal.

1503
01:56:29,507 --> 01:56:32,674
That secret isn't more
precious than your life.

1504
01:56:32,944 --> 01:56:34,436
And think.

1505
01:56:37,064 --> 01:56:41,010
How long will you stay in
this dirt with your young daughter?

1506
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:44,091
Don't you dare mention my daughter.
I will kill you.

1507
01:56:44,945 --> 01:56:49,378
You want to take me out of dirt.
Look at yourself first.

1508
01:56:50,188 --> 01:56:52,458
You yourself are walloping
in the mud of your crimes.

1509
01:56:52,913 --> 01:56:54,718
How will you take
others out from dirt?

1510
01:56:55,053 --> 01:56:56,588
Get out from here.

1511
01:56:59,367 --> 01:57:00,653
I am going.

1512
01:57:02,156 --> 01:57:06,805
But just think what will
happen to you after I have left.

1513
01:57:13,734 --> 01:57:14,869
What do you mean?

1514
01:57:15,215 --> 01:57:18,512
Nobody stop anyone
without a reason, boss.

1515
01:57:19,237 --> 01:57:22,296
You have some reason.
And even I have some reason.

1516
01:57:22,826 --> 01:57:24,253
Tell me clearly.

1517
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:27,334
Have you see Madan's daughter?

1518
01:57:28,285 --> 01:57:29,702
She is very beautiful.

1519
01:57:30,112 --> 01:57:33,637
If I can achieve my
end while doing your work?

1520
01:57:34,944 --> 01:57:35,944
Got it?

1521
01:57:38,848 --> 01:57:39,994
Got it.

1522
01:57:45,539 --> 01:57:49,182
Raja, I had gone to the
office after a long time today.

1523
01:57:50,393 --> 01:57:54,090
I saw your picture there.
I was very pleased.

1524
01:57:55,398 --> 01:57:58,361
Gradually you have taken
over my work in such a way..

1525
01:57:59,290 --> 01:58:01,117
That there is no need for me now.

1526
01:58:06,890 --> 01:58:11,279
A few days ago the
factory's manager had come.

1527
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:16,003
He said that please
sign these documents.

1528
01:58:16,522 --> 01:58:19,095
I told him that only
Raja can sign documents.

1529
01:58:20,371 --> 01:58:22,057
Do you know what he said?

1530
01:58:22,933 --> 01:58:26,219
He said these are my final signatures.

1531
01:58:29,506 --> 01:58:33,884
Raja, did you see the bank statement?

1532
01:58:35,094 --> 01:58:37,700
Everything has been
transferred to you.

1533
01:58:38,597 --> 01:58:42,943
You have gradually
rendered me useless.

1534
01:58:43,408 --> 01:58:48,683
I am scared that one day I
will have to ask you for something...

1535
01:58:49,634 --> 01:58:51,353
I will have to ask you for something.

1536
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:02,758
Sugeet, what happened?

1537
01:59:03,061 --> 01:59:05,137
They injured me and
nabbed Kammo, Raja.

1538
01:59:05,395 --> 01:59:07,190
What? Who were they?

1539
01:59:07,525 --> 01:59:08,790
I don't know anyone.

1540
01:59:08,995 --> 01:59:11,493
And from Kammo I learnt
that Jagga is also responsible.

1541
01:59:11,785 --> 01:59:12,812
Jagga.

1542
01:59:13,233 --> 01:59:16,660
Where is Kammo? Where is Kammo?

1543
01:59:24,422 --> 01:59:26,054
Tell me.
Tell me. Where is Kammo?

1544
01:59:26,134 --> 01:59:27,417
With the boss.

1545
01:59:30,606 --> 01:59:33,330
Your old father has been informed.

1546
01:59:33,816 --> 01:59:38,281
If you still don't listen
to me than you will be..

1547
01:59:38,361 --> 01:59:41,578
Taken off in such
a way that you and that..

1548
01:59:41,859 --> 01:59:44,616
Old man will remember for life.

1549
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:48,994
If you are so brave then
you could have informed Raja.

1550
01:59:49,264 --> 01:59:50,615
Raja?

1551
01:59:51,253 --> 01:59:54,691
He is so drunk in
wealth that he doesn't..

1552
01:59:55,621 --> 01:59:58,734
Even care for your honor.

1553
02:00:02,258 --> 02:00:03,469
Raja.

1554
02:00:03,815 --> 02:00:07,458
Scoundrel. I spared you that day.

1555
02:00:08,259 --> 02:00:09,934
Today I won't.

1556
02:00:16,129 --> 02:00:19,016
This is your last moment.
Pray to your god.

1557
02:00:19,096 --> 02:00:21,426
Raja. Raja. Let him go.

1558
02:00:21,718 --> 02:00:24,399
Take me away from here.
Take me to my father.

1559
02:00:45,459 --> 02:00:50,669
If you had seen cruelty
than even I have.

1560
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:01,231
Uncle, look.
I have got back your Kammo.

1561
02:01:01,513 --> 02:01:03,383
No one can look at her now.

1562
02:01:03,718 --> 02:01:05,123
Get up uncle. Look.

1563
02:01:07,004 --> 02:01:09,923
Uncle. Uncle.

1564
02:01:12,561 --> 02:01:14,107
Father.

1565
02:01:15,015 --> 02:01:16,269
Father.

1566
02:01:17,913 --> 02:01:19,167
Father.

1567
02:01:20,864 --> 02:01:22,367
Father.

1568
02:01:25,978 --> 02:01:27,167
Father.

1569
02:01:39,903 --> 02:01:42,940
Today I Diwali and
you are dead today, Raja.

1570
02:01:44,692 --> 02:01:45,816
Renu.

1571
02:01:46,659 --> 02:01:49,265
- Do you know why Diwali is celebrated?
- Yes.

1572
02:01:49,676 --> 02:01:51,913
On this day Lord Ram
returned to Ayodhya..

1573
02:01:51,993 --> 02:01:55,222
After 14 years of exile.
To celebrate the same.

1574
02:01:56,065 --> 02:02:00,563
But before this Lord
Ram had destroyed Ravan.

1575
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:04,985
Destroyed cruelty.

1576
02:02:08,281 --> 02:02:11,341
Today is really a day of joy.

1577
02:02:14,099 --> 02:02:17,072
Today is the day to gamble, son.

1578
02:02:17,310 --> 02:02:19,720
Several great people gamble.

1579
02:02:20,153 --> 02:02:23,894
You are right.
Even I will gamble today.

1580
02:02:25,623 --> 02:02:26,623
Why not?

1581
02:02:29,277 --> 02:02:30,531
Fold.

1582
02:02:35,883 --> 02:02:38,510
Take darling. Now you deal
the cards for my good luck.

1583
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,024
Pack.

1584
02:02:54,468 --> 02:02:55,754
Even I pack.

1585
02:02:57,733 --> 02:02:59,106
Blind for 500.

1586
02:02:59,549 --> 02:03:01,592
- Blind for 500.
- Me too.

1587
02:03:08,393 --> 02:03:09,614
Bet for 1000.

1588
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,766
Blind for 500.

1589
02:03:14,609 --> 02:03:15,614
Blind for 1000.

1590
02:03:15,885 --> 02:03:18,231
Don't be in a hurry Raja. Play slowly

1591
02:03:18,469 --> 02:03:20,523
Dear, let him play.
Nobody is a stranger here.

1592
02:03:20,782 --> 02:03:22,004
Come on.

1593
02:03:24,015 --> 02:03:25,015
Come on Ratan.

1594
02:03:25,063 --> 02:03:26,123
I am pack.

1595
02:03:26,912 --> 02:03:28,588
I think we will have
to compete this time.

1596
02:03:29,301 --> 02:03:32,133
Yes, it will be great if the
father and the son-in-law compete.

1597
02:03:32,749 --> 02:03:34,976
Mother and daughters-in-law
fight are common.

1598
02:03:35,323 --> 02:03:38,188
Let's see how the father
and the son-in-law will fare today.

1599
02:03:40,361 --> 02:03:43,713
Ratan you want to see us. Take this.

1600
02:03:44,837 --> 02:03:47,064
Blind for 2000.

1601
02:03:47,832 --> 02:03:48,869
4000

1602
02:03:51,842 --> 02:03:52,842
5000

1603
02:03:53,572 --> 02:03:54,621
10000

1604
02:03:56,144 --> 02:03:57,193
Raja.

1605
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,241
We are playing, darling. Do or die.

1606
02:04:01,355 --> 02:04:03,896
Come on. You are thinking too much.

1607
02:04:13,658 --> 02:04:15,301
Playing for 20,000.

1608
02:04:16,133 --> 02:04:17,052
Cash?

1609
02:04:17,132 --> 02:04:18,869
Yes, you will get the cash.

1610
02:04:19,517 --> 02:04:21,344
Not later. Now.

1611
02:04:22,599 --> 02:04:23,599
On the table.

1612
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:25,480
Raja!

1613
02:04:25,626 --> 02:04:27,312
There is no borrowing in gambling.

1614
02:04:31,756 --> 02:04:34,047
Malhotra, give me 50,000.

1615
02:04:34,555 --> 02:04:36,231
Sorry, I am completely wiped out.

1616
02:04:36,663 --> 02:04:37,917
Come. Let's go.

1617
02:04:41,139 --> 02:04:42,674
Ratan. Get the phone.

1618
02:04:42,934 --> 02:04:44,890
What are you doing Raja? Stop it now.

1619
02:04:46,112 --> 02:04:47,928
The game has just started, darling.

1620
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:53,031
Hello? Yes, Mr. Mehta. This is Shyam.

1621
02:04:53,497 --> 02:04:57,032
Look, come to the
club with 50,000 rupees.

1622
02:04:58,264 --> 02:04:59,264
What?

1623
02:04:59,994 --> 02:05:01,834
There is not even a
single paisa in my account.

1624
02:05:02,957 --> 02:05:04,699
Maybe you have forgotten
than all your accounts..

1625
02:05:04,723 --> 02:05:07,919
Have been transferred to me now.

1626
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:11,962
This means that...

1627
02:05:12,211 --> 02:05:14,103
You have lost.

1628
02:05:20,167 --> 02:05:21,167
Stop.

1629
02:05:21,735 --> 02:05:23,702
The game has not ended yet.

1630
02:05:24,794 --> 02:05:27,508
I am betting 20,000 on behalf of sir.

1631
02:05:28,891 --> 02:05:29,891
Good.

1632
02:05:34,415 --> 02:05:35,885
50,000.

1633
02:05:47,821 --> 02:05:51,129
No cheating, sir. Be honest.

1634
02:05:54,372 --> 02:05:59,884
Do you remember 20 years
ago on a similar Diwali night..

1635
02:06:01,117 --> 02:06:05,917
You had cheated like
this and had switched cards.

1636
02:06:07,063 --> 02:06:11,366
And that card pushed
a unlucky fellow to his death.

1637
02:06:13,365 --> 02:06:14,663
Sir, do you remember?

1638
02:06:14,743 --> 02:06:16,306
Do you remember that man's face?

1639
02:06:16,386 --> 02:06:17,679
The one whom you cheated.

1640
02:06:18,036 --> 02:06:19,843
The one whose money
you snatched away by fraud.

1641
02:06:19,867 --> 02:06:21,279
50,000 rupees.

1642
02:06:22,371 --> 02:06:25,311
I will remind you
if you don't remember.

1643
02:06:26,252 --> 02:06:28,403
Look. Look at me carefully.

1644
02:06:29,290 --> 02:06:33,139
You will still see
those helpless people..

1645
02:06:33,496 --> 02:06:34,998
Drowning at sea in my eyes.

1646
02:06:35,323 --> 02:06:38,685
Because I the son of
the same unlucky person.

1647
02:06:42,068 --> 02:06:45,214
And I was yearning to
take my revenge for 20 years.

1648
02:06:45,744 --> 02:06:47,538
Today you again have..

1649
02:06:50,122 --> 02:06:51,149
2 aces.

1650
02:06:52,219 --> 02:06:53,279
I have.

1651
02:06:57,809 --> 02:06:59,171
I have won the game.

1652
02:06:59,251 --> 02:07:00,392
Raja.

1653
02:07:00,684 --> 02:07:01,819
He is the one Renu.

1654
02:07:01,899 --> 02:07:04,565
He is the cruel person
about whom you had decided.

1655
02:07:04,782 --> 02:07:06,457
That you must destroy such a person..

1656
02:07:06,537 --> 02:07:08,068
Even if he is a your father.

1657
02:07:09,181 --> 02:07:11,548
Today this man is again
in the same condition..

1658
02:07:11,628 --> 02:07:12,781
When he has no one.

1659
02:07:13,083 --> 02:07:15,613
He neither has wealth nor respect.

1660
02:07:16,478 --> 02:07:18,900
You are poor today.
You don't have anything.

1661
02:07:19,526 --> 02:07:21,418
That's why you have only path.

1662
02:07:21,591 --> 02:07:25,396
The path which my father took.
Of suicide.

1663
02:07:25,969 --> 02:07:27,774
No. No. No.

1664
02:07:32,715 --> 02:07:34,153
Don't lose hope, boss.

1665
02:07:34,661 --> 02:07:37,148
You will gain what
you have lost again.

1666
02:07:37,882 --> 02:07:42,358
Just give me a hint and
I will get rid of him forever.

1667
02:08:06,617 --> 02:08:08,109
Where are our workers?

1668
02:08:08,844 --> 02:08:09,936
It seems like a ploy.

1669
02:08:10,303 --> 02:08:11,763
Raja, let's return.

1670
02:08:12,044 --> 02:08:14,153
- No.
- What is the matter?

1671
02:08:14,499 --> 02:08:16,142
Will explain later. Come.

1672
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:58,890
What are you doing here, Ratanlal?

1673
02:08:59,150 --> 02:09:01,150
What are you doing here, Raja?

1674
02:09:02,209 --> 02:09:03,345
I am the owner here.

1675
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:04,790
You must have been at one time.

1676
02:09:05,409 --> 02:09:06,923
I am the in-charge now.

1677
02:09:07,994 --> 02:09:11,367
I rule the land you
are standing upon now.

1678
02:09:11,594 --> 02:09:14,102
Didn't I say so Raja? It was a ploy.

1679
02:09:14,653 --> 02:09:17,172
You are right. Come let's go.

1680
02:09:18,112 --> 02:09:22,501
Stop. You have to pay
your dies before leaving.

1681
02:09:23,193 --> 02:09:26,090
- Bro, he is asking for dues.
- Pay him.

1682
02:09:35,896 --> 02:09:37,269
Come on. Go ahead.

1683
02:11:10,612 --> 02:11:11,769
What nonsense?

1684
02:11:13,661 --> 02:11:16,094
I don't understand your language.

1685
02:11:16,353 --> 02:11:19,186
You don't understand spoken language.
Do you understand sign language?

1686
02:13:22,249 --> 02:13:24,282
Come on. Fast.

1687
02:13:53,709 --> 02:13:55,103
There they are.

1688
02:15:28,018 --> 02:15:29,018
Raja.

1689
02:15:40,076 --> 02:15:41,076
Why you save me?

1690
02:15:41,174 --> 02:15:44,166
Raja, my life was in danger.

1691
02:15:45,620 --> 02:15:50,714
And then how can I see
my daughter becoming a widow?

1692
02:15:51,665 --> 02:15:52,665
Police. Police.

1693
02:15:55,947 --> 02:15:58,991
Why did you endanger
your life to save mine?

1694
02:15:59,155 --> 02:16:02,174
Son, how do I tell you?

1695
02:16:03,004 --> 02:16:08,193
The one who can die cannot kill.

1696
02:16:08,444 --> 02:16:11,194
Daddy. Daddy,
what is wrong with you, daddy?

1697
02:16:11,274 --> 02:16:14,756
- Inspector, take him to the hospital fast.
- Oh no.

1698
02:16:14,929 --> 02:16:16,815
Raja, I don't have much time.

1699
02:16:16,970 --> 02:16:19,504
Listen to me carefully.

1700
02:16:20,318 --> 02:16:25,230
The way you had burning in
the fire of revenge for 20 years..

1701
02:16:26,121 --> 02:16:32,444
In the same even I have
been embarrassed of my cruelty.

1702
02:16:33,853 --> 02:16:34,994
But today...

1703
02:16:35,722 --> 02:16:38,057
Today that sin has been washed off.

1704
02:16:38,888 --> 02:16:43,255
Now you can never hate me.

1705
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:46,231
- Renu.
- Daddy.

1706
02:16:46,311 --> 02:16:47,511
- Renu.
- Daddy.

1707
02:16:47,591 --> 02:16:49,976
- Raja.
- Daddy.
