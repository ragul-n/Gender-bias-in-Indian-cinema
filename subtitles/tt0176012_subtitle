00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,097
I mean, get out of here.

4
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:48,943
do not say that.

5
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:50,495
I am not going.

6
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:52,615
- If you don't leave, I will scream.
- Scream...?

7
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:55,015
But no one can hear you.

8
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,215
Come to my arms once.

9
00:02:57,335 --> 00:03:00,055
- Only once.
- Don't take advantage of my helplessness.

10
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:03,135
I am helpless.
My heart failed me.

11
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:06,395
- Come to me.
- No.

12
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:09,655
- I was waiting for this opportunity.
- Leave me alone.

13
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:11,575
- Now you can't escape.
- Durjana.

14
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,020
- No one can save you.
- Leave me alone.

15
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,575
- Help me.  leave me alone
- No.

16
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,831
- Help me.
- You can't escape.

17
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:22,015
- Now you can't escape.
- Leave me alone.

18
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,215
- Where is that thug?
- Who?

19
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:25,946
The person who tried to molest you.

20
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,599
are you mad?

21
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,095
I heard him say, no
one can save you.

22
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,255
- A radio set...?
- Yes, a radio.

23
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:41,015
So it's a play.

24
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,694
I was scared.

25
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,174
- Usually thugs enter the cabin when the girls are alone.
- Yes.

26
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:53,396
- But who are you?
- I am.

27
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:57,286
- Don't you know this is a women's compartment?
- what?

28
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:03,254
- Really, this is a women's compartment?
- Yes.

29
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:05,974
I'm very sorry.  I made a mistake.

30
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,054
By the time I reached the
station, the train was moving.

31
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:11,014
I got into it with great difficulty.

32
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,134
Now get off.

33
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:14,782
It is even more difficult.
Now the train is running fast.

34
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:17,958
- If you pull the chain it will stop.
- Yes, but.

35
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,833
If you pull the chain to stop the train.

36
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:24,934
All passengers come to this compartment.

37
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:28,561
A girl is traveling alone
in this compartment.

38
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,983
And there are different types
of passengers in a train.  right?

39
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:37,846
God

40
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:44,906
One of these windows or doors?

41
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,560
Mrs.  I am a decent person.

42
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,730
I get off at the next station.

43
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:57,991
- But it takes another two hours to get to the next place.
- Two hours.

44
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:01,574
Then I'll pull the chain.

45
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:04,814
No, you can get off
at the next station.

46
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:06,134

00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:13,251

Coal powder.

00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:18,837
- You will not have such trouble in the upper bed.

50
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:21,374
I will go.

51
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,454

- Do you want to jump too?
- Don't talk nonsense.

71
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:54,879
- Pick up luggage.
- Okay, I'll take it.

72
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:58,534
He used to daydream,
how about now?

73
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,854
Girl, he's even worse now.

74
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,707
He sweeps up with a broom.
He fights with himself.

75
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:07,293
I always find something broken.

76
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,321
I'm going to meet my girlfriend.

77
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:13,320

Taruna.

00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,173
Meena when did you come?

80
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:02,023
First of all tell me who
did you sing a song for?

81
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:03,466
Obviously, for you.

82
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,574
You left me alone and went to town.

83
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,654
As soon as I came, I
went straight to your house.

84
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,477
But uncle said you are here.

85
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,534
So I came here to find you.

86
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,782
I come here every day
after finishing my work.

87
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,094
Remember when we were
kids catching butterflies here?

88
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:22,958
And we had strange
views of that mountain top?

89
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,088
This valley, the river...

90
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:32,372
...The greenery, the forest, everything
seems to have brought a new birth.

91
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:36,094
But I still don't own anything.

92
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,254
Stop the poetry.

93
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:41,649
I am very tired and hungry.

94
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,791
- Let's go home.
- Very hungry?

95
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:58,369
- Why did he come here?
- Who is he?

96
00:12:58,871 --> 00:12:59,894
Come on.  I will tell you.

97
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:08,014
"let's play a game"

98
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,287
"Sultan is very bad"

99
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,558
"Your food is spoiled."

100
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,344
is coming

101
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:31,486
who are you

102
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,688
Is this Mr. Thakur's house?

103
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:41,538
Yes.  But Mr. Thakur is not at home.

104
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:43,208
Listen, brother.

105
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:48,286
Give this letter to the people at home.

106
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,542
- Why this?
- You are very tall.

107
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:01,366
Yes, I have come from a long way, now go.

108
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,515
Have you seen the results of being friendly?

109
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:11,090
He came here looking for you.

110
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,315
- Why did you call him?
- What to do now?

111
00:14:14,745 --> 00:14:16,531
Mrs.

112
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,835
A tall handsome guest has arrived.

113
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:22,997
He gave this envelope.

114
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:31,035
His name is Rajesh.

115
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,035
Dad's new manager.

116
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:37,275
- Tell him that Mr. Thakur is not at home.
- I already said that.

117
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:38,924
I'll say it again.

118
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,414
what are u doing?

119
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:44,875
Mr. Thakur said that
new manager will come.

120
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,568
There is no point in him doing anything.

121
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,755
Mom, I'm not doing anything.

122
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,955
- It happens.
- Now go.

123
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,235
Daughter, go with the
manager to the guesthouse.

124
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:01,419
Give him the facilities he needs.

125
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,635
I am...?

126
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:10,706
I am scared.

127
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,195
What is there to fear?
If something happens, I'll take care of it.

128
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:17,355
- If something happens?
- Nothing will happen.

129
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,115
Go.

130
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:30,003
Mr. Thakur has gone hunting.

131
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,235
- When will he come back?
- Coming back...?

132
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,795
tomorrow

133
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,416
Come on.  I will show you the room.

134
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:44,922
I'm very sorry.
Are you Mr. Thakur's daughter?

135
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:46,104
No.

136
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:51,115
- So you must be his relative?
- No.

137
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:53,896
- A neighbor of his...?
- No.

138
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,020
Are you someone who works under him?

139
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,660
No.

140
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:03,740
- Have you promised not to say the word "yes"?
- No.

141
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:06,235
your name?

142
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,054
- You don't tell me?
- No.

143
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:12,619
- Then ask my name.
- No.

144
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:13,932
Not again...?

145
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:18,179
A strange place.

146
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,199
The girl says "no".
The buffalo says yes.

147
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,207
Why did you stop here?
Where should I be?

148
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:26,039
- Here.
- Here...?

149
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,439
No.

150
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,827
I am Mr. Thakur's manager.

151
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,713
Not his shepherd.

152
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:55,378
tell me the truth
Where should I be?

153
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:57,619
- Here.
- Here?

154
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,979
A strange girl.

155
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:03,334
Earlier they said "no"
now they say "here"

156
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:06,019
Like the room?

157
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,299
the room?

158
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:11,699
the room?

159
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:18,915
Is this a room?

160
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,992
Oh, my God.

161
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:26,855
- Where do I sleep?
- Here.

162
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,455
- Where do I take a shower?
- Here.

163
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:31,385
- Where do I eat?
- Here.

164
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:35,763
It's wrong for me to ask
you to stop saying ``no''.

165
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:40,175
Your "no" answer is
better than "here" answer.

166
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:44,821
I can't stay here a moment.

167
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,805
- No shouting here.
- Why is that?

168
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,439
- Not good for animals.
- Does that mean?

169
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:54,731
This is the time to rest them.

170
00:17:55,104 --> 00:18:00,091
Indeed, there is no better
place for someone like you.

171
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:03,471
There is a mattress and a bed.
Rest comfortably.

172
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,655
Do you see this rope?

173
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,510
Yes.

174
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,438
You pull it and the bell will ring.

175
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:14,575
- And then?
- I will come.

176
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,879
- Why is that?
- To ask what you want.

177
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:27,035
It's a bell.  But it sounds
like ancient times.

178
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:29,015
Don't have an electronic bell?

179
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:32,890
- No?

180
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:47,005
If this is how I live,
how will my work be?

181
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:52,556
Did you say it was a bell?

182
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:55,365
He said it was
like an ancient one.

183
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:04,070
It rings.  The stranger is speaking.

184
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,436
- Why is that?
- He must be hungry.

185
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:08,957
- He rings the bell.
- Let him ring it.

186
00:19:09,077 --> 00:19:11,428
Do not give him food?

187
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:14,201
Let him starve today.

188
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,476
I think he is hungry.

189
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,906
If he didn't get food.

190
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:40,247
I think he got tired of ringing it.

191
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:44,367
Meena, a joke should have a limit.

192
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,167
Now we have to feed him.

193
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:48,687
If he starves to death, so will we...

194
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,647
He won't die so soon.

195
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:55,010
If you feel sorry for
him, give him food.

196
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,753
Food was brought.  Stop ringing now.

197
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:17,087
Tell me how
often it should ring.

198
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:21,309
My hands and feet
are numb from ringing it.

199
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:23,927
- Then I will go.
- Listen to this.

200
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,967
- Yes?
- Put the food here.

201
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:30,127
But how do you eat?
Your hands are numb.

202
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:33,546
If I don't eat I will die.
Leave it here.

203
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:43,287
- Is this food?
- You are new here.

204
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:47,148
- So you get good food like this for two or three days.
- Is this good food?

205
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:51,967
If this is good, how will it
be in three or four days?

206
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:55,287
do not be sad.
We will take good care of you.

207
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:58,207
- You will not face any problem.
- Even you won't face any problem.

208
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:02,935
Forget four days.  If I get food
like this for two days, I won't be here.

209
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,848
Thanks a lot.  you can go

210
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,607
listen to this

211
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:11,506
Take this food.
I can't eat them.

212
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,404
- You won't get it back.
- what?

213
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,247
You don't get food back.

214
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:18,567
- is it?
- Yes.

215
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:26,407
Then leave it here.  I will eat it.

216
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:57,047
- Madam, get up.
- why?

217
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,687
I brought hot tea for you.

218
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:03,927
- Did you come to wake me up early in the morning?
- Is it morning for you?

219
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,327
It is now 11.45 am.

220
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,287
drink tea  I have to
cook rice for dinner.

221
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:13,247
Meena.  Meena, wake up.

222
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:14,783
- why?
- Big question.

223
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:17,087
- What is it?
- He's going.

224
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:20,167
- Who?
- That's the new manager.

225
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,327
Are you both talking
about that tall guy?

226
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:27,887
- I told him that the train was leaving.
- Shut up.

227
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:31,652
What do we do now,
what do we say if dad asks?

228
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:34,326
I warned you not to joke.

229
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:37,167
- Solve it yourself now.
- No.

230
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,767
We have to stop him somehow.

231
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:42,417
If you say so, I will kill
the dog and send it to him.

232
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,010
- I will release.
- No, you idiot.

233
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,263
Then tell me.  I will stop him.

234
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:49,147
- Then go quickly.
- I will stop him.

235
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,469
- Go.
- I will stop him.

236
00:22:57,233 --> 00:23:01,367
Sir, I'm sorry.  I
won't let you go.

237
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:04,687
- I'm across your path.
- Leave me alone.

238
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:07,407
my goodness!  He is very angry.

239
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:11,847
Don't go, sir.

240
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:14,527
Otherwise I will lose my job.

241
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:16,970
Sir don't lose my job.
Give me your suitcase.

242
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,523
I'm done, sir.

243
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:23,328
Oh, my God.  Sir came

244
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:27,247
Driver, stop.

245
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,344
- Hello, Mr. Thakur.
- Welcome.

246
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:35,167
who are you

247
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:38,247
- Rajesh.
- Rajesh?

248
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,967
Did you come, why is this?

249
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,807
- The respect received by your manager.
- Does that mean?

250
00:23:45,065 --> 00:23:50,287
Because of how I got a cow
shed, a bug bed and food for shelter.

251
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,846
But I had given them proper
instructions before I left.

252
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,881
OK, come with me.

253
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:58,357
Oh my god, daddy's here.

254
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,497
- What to do now?
- I do not know.

255
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:04,097
If I go out for a day,
everything goes haywire.

256
00:24:04,117 --> 00:24:05,837
Everyone does what they like.

257
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,337
I told you my new
manager was coming.

258
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:11,235
And I had arranged his
accommodation in the new cabin.

259
00:24:11,355 --> 00:24:13,060
Then why did he
stay in the cattle shed?

260
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:17,148
Sir, I asked her to take
me to the guest house.

261
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:20,837
Then why was he taken to
the cowshed?  Bring her here.

262
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:23,517
- Sir, she is inside.
- Inside...?

263
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:24,937
talk to her

264
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:33,437
Why did you tell my manager
to stay in the cowshed?

265
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:37,451
Not me, Meena
told me to do that.

266
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,717
Meena...?  Meena is not here.

267
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:40,893
She is in town.

268
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:42,517
Goodbye, Dad.

269
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:47,117
When did you come back, daughter?
Have the university holidays started?

270
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,480
- Yes.
- Come on, daughter.

271
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:54,780
Why did this to Mr. Rajesh?

272
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,555
Dad, I wanted to know if he
was fit for life in the remote village.

273
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:03,962
Rajesh sir, she has checked you.

274
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:08,437
- Now what do you want to say?
- Now I want to ask if I passed the test.

275
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:11,357
Well, come on.

276
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:20,037
- Okay then.
- I also own the garden on the other side of the tree.

277
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,997
And this garden is bigger than the other garden.

278
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:26,157
But it is different.

279
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:30,357
Compared to other parks,
its income is very low.

280
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:34,837
- What could be the reason, Mr. Thakur?
- It could be my carelessness.

281
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,384
If there is another reason, you tell me.

282
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:40,325
Mr. Mehta, seems like
a very intelligent person.

283
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:42,514
No problem.

284
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:44,999
This business is running
because of Mr. Mehta.

285
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,157
Otherwise it would have
been completely destroyed.

286
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:49,310
Sir, the collector has arrived.

287
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,677
He asks you.

288
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,767
did you see?  This
time I will not go hunting.

289
00:25:53,947 --> 00:25:55,988
- Mr. Mehta.  Show him around.
- Yes...?

290
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:57,508
- I will come.
- Okay.

291
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:00,333
Come on.

292
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:01,604
- Mr. Mehta.
- Yes?

293
00:26:01,816 --> 00:26:06,127
- Mr. Thakur respects you a lot.
- It is his grace.

294
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:07,763
Hello, Lala Bhagatram.

295
00:26:08,312 --> 00:26:09,887
Welcome.  how are you

296
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:11,087
Good.

297
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:15,202
Mr. Mehta, who is the
person in this city with you?

298
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,647
He is Mr. Thakur's new
manager, Mr. Rajesh.

299
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,407
He is Lala Bhagatram.

300
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,055
He gets the contract of
Mr. Thakur's estate every year.

301
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:29,877
He is a good person.  Very friendly.

302
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,247
Nice to meet you.

303
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:36,087
No need.  He is decent.

304
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:41,487
Mr. Lala is known for his fist fights.

305
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,327
- How are you?
- You seem to be a talented person.

306
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,927
Mr. Mehta said that
I am very friendly.

307
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:53,285
If you are by my side, I will
sacrifice my blood for you.

308
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,562
Have you seen Mr. Rajesh?
He is talented.

309
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:02,561
He is also very good with a knife.

310
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:05,807
Even with his eyes closed,
he does not miss the target.

311
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:10,895
- Mr. Mehta, give the guest an apple for me.
- Okay.

312
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:12,246
here

313
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,391
- Mr. Mehta.
- Yes?

314
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,882
- You seem friendly with him.
- What else to do?

315
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,522
We should live in harmony.

316
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:22,602
Mr. Thakur does not award
contracts to anyone but him.

317
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:25,945
And this poor man suffers loss,
but does not break this communion.

318
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:36,050
Rajesh, Bhagatram is really old.

319
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:38,250
I give him the contract every year.

320
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,095
Whether the transaction
is oral or written, I do it.

321
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:44,810
Mr. Thakur, I also don't want
you to break your promise.

322
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,179
But I'm your manager.  It is my
duty to think of your profits and losses.

323
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:51,210
it is good.  But what do I do now?

324
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,290
nothing  Whenever you do
business, do it in front of me.

325
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,775
Okay, that's why I
made you manager.

326
00:27:57,895 --> 00:27:59,410
Sir, hot tea.

327
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,210
Okay, do you take good
care of the manager?

328
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,210
yes sir

329
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,850
Every morning I give him
tea with 6 spoons of sugar.

330
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,450
- How many spoons?
- 6 spoons.

331
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,530
By the way, from today I will add 7 spoons of sugar.

332
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,212
Friendship with a fool is a troublesome thing.

333
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:20,316
Sir called me a fool.
He insulted me.

334
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:22,690
- Now I don't give him tea.
- Who gives tea?

335
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,890
I do not know.

336
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,905
Mr. Rajesh, don't worry.
I raised him with lots of love.

337
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:30,890
Dad, I'll make the tea.

338
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,705
Yes, daughter.  Do that.

339
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,810
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

340
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,410
Mr. Thakur, when will
Bhagatram return to the office?

341
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,810
Maybe tomorrow.

342
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:47,141
- How many spoons of sugar?
- It's two.

343
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,490
Tell us what you like to eat.
Will prepare it.

344
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,610
Yes, don't hesitate.

345
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,010
- Say what you like.
- Actually I eat everything.

346
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,490
But I love millet bread,
garlic sauce and jaggery.

347
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,983
Jaggery... does anyone eat that?

348
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:09,010
If this is what he wants, father,
why are you stopping him?

349
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,713
- He won't be able to eat a bit.
- I have already eaten.

350
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,310
But I don't remember
when or where I ate it.

351
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:17,270
I remember really liking it.

352
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,490
- Have you ever eaten it?
- No.

353
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,275
Proceed.  Why did you stop?

354
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,815
for you.

355
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:42,310
why is that

356
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,930
You can stop by for me tomorrow.

357
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,090
Do I need to stay for a guest?

358
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,117
You have already
checked this stranger.

359
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:54,250
So how can I serve you?

360
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,050
- I want to ask you something.
- Yes.

361
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,970
- I think it's okay.
- ask me.

362
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,401
Do you feel the wrong way?

363
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:06,210
- Then don't ask.
- I ask you...

364
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,766
Where is this road going?

365
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,170
It takes time to tell.

366
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:16,130
Sir, these ways are deceptive.

367
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,330
Yes.  I can see that.

368
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:20,070
Besides that, ask for something else?

369
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:24,695
- Show me your hands.
- Why is that?

370
00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:27,170
I mean they are really
lovely and delicate.

371
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,891
Why, do you want to attack?

372
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:34,275
If it pleases you, here I am ready.

373
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:39,490
I forgive you.
My hand took pity.

374
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:44,014
You may take pity on me and
send millet bread and garlic.

375
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,774
If you are so fond of eating
them, I will send them daily.

376
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:49,894
believe me.  I've been
eating them all my life.

377
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:53,814
Visitors stay for a
while, not for life.  got it?

378
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,463
go now

379
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:01,694
That means he is very intelligent.

380
00:31:02,024 --> 00:31:05,454
And cunning.  He talks
sweetly to both of us.

381
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,614
- We have to teach him a lesson.
- How is that?

382
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:09,374
Revenge of war with war.

383
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,688
Revenge with sweet
talk with sweet talk.

384
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:18,374
- Meaning?
- I mean, if he laughs, we should laugh.

385
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,894
- Why is that?
- We need to check his comments.

386
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:26,954
He tells every girl
the same thing.

387
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,214
- So what do you do?
- Nothing.

388
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:33,384
It will be a good way to pass the time.
Let's have fun in this game.

389
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:36,694
From childhood we
played all games together.

390
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,294
Let's play this together.

391
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,054
But it's a complicated game.

392
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:45,814
Taruna, I'm really bored.

393
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:47,214
So let's have some fun.

394
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,310
Let's call him that.

395
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,814
He thinks we are
in love with him.

396
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:58,010
Let's fool him.

397
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,791
- An hour late.
- Does that mean?

398
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:15,444
You always go this way at
3 pm.  But now it's 4 o'clock.

399
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:19,534
- Are you a detective?
- Yes.

400
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:23,294
- A private detective for private affairs.
- Meaning?

401
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:29,413
I was waiting for you.

402
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,814
Wait a moment
so I can talk to you.

403
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:34,454
I'm in a hurry today.

404
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:38,454
I will stay from tomorrow, but
after taking Mr. Thakur's permission.

405
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,614
Oh, my God.

406
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,905
"This Spring"

407
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,246
"this weather"

408
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:23,650
"Enemy of my heart.
Where are you going?"

409
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:30,695
"Enemy of my heart.
Where are you going?"

410
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:37,382
"This spring is very restless."

411
00:33:37,693 --> 00:33:42,787
"My Love Is Calling You"

412
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:45,930
"But you don't care about me.
What can I do?"

413
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,478
"Oh, my God"

414
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:22,853
"Beloved, in spite of your shadow"

415
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:26,468
"Beloved, in spite of your shadow"

416
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:33,594
"Together with my
shadow, I feel happy"

417
00:34:33,714 --> 00:34:37,132
"And I bloom with charm."

418
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,536
"Look at my curves"

419
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:52,633
"Enemy of my heart.
Where are you going?"

420
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:59,030
"This spring is very restless."

421
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,250
"Here and My Love Speaks to You"

422
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,095
"But you don't care about me.
What can I do?"

423
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,846
"Oh, my God"

424
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,015
"Come to me. Don't be late."

425
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:44,630
"Come to me. Don't be late."

426
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:48,297
"My lazy walk is charming"

427
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:55,380
"Darling, if you come
after so many years"

428
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,684
"I'm not alive until then"

429
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:10,739
"Enemy of my heart.
Where are you going?"

430
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:17,304
"This spring is very restless."

431
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:22,709
"This Beauty and My
Love Speaks to You"

432
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:25,465
"But you don't care about me.
What can I do?"

433
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:28,352
"Oh, my God"

434
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:36,244
"Enemy of my heart.
Where are you going?"

435
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:43,206
"Enemy of my heart.
Where are you going?"

436
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:54,148
listen to this

437
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:58,108
- Yes?
- I want to ask you something.

438
00:36:58,228 --> 00:37:00,848
- Yes.
- You know how to play the flute, don't you?

439
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,388
- The flute?
- Yes.

440
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,970
- not.
- But yesterday you played it.

441
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,570
yesterday?

442
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:09,123
- What time?
- Night.

443
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,370
- I saw it.
- It's a lie.

444
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,970
No.  It was a full moon night.

445
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:19,890
The stars were shining.
And a cold wind blew.

446
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,730
You were playing the flute under
the tree with your eyes closed.

447
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,570
Yesterday I was sitting by the
fire at home to avoid the cold.

448
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:30,610
You say I played the flute.

449
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,035
It must have been someone else.
That's not me.

450
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:34,050
No.  That's you.

451
00:37:36,692 --> 00:37:38,810
It is such a beautiful dream.

452
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,590
- a dream?
- Yes.

453
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:46,170
can i go now

454
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,490
When will you play
the flute for me again?

455
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,730
Meet me in your dreams.
I will play it.

456
00:37:55,323 --> 00:37:57,790
meet me in
dreams  I will play it.

457
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,730
Mr. Thakur, what is this?

458
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,590
- This agreement is made for half of the estate.
- Yes.

459
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,418
- That's Rajesh's advice.
- Rajesh?

460
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:10,702
Mr. Thakur, he doesn't
know about our old relations.

461
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,350
I have been contracting
your garden for many years.

462
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,030
I have to suffer losses every day,
but I have never complained to you.

463
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,745
- Right?
- Yes.

464
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,110
So this year a contract for half
of the garden is given to you.

465
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,293
If there is a loss, it is half.

466
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,736
Mr. Manager, when there
is a loss, it must be all.

467
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:32,881
Will it be a loss?

468
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:34,681
Prepare documents
for the entire park.

469
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:37,030
- It is a bit difficult Mr. Bhagatram.
- Why is that?

470
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,824
The contract for the rest of the
estate is given to someone else.

471
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:42,110
Then give him this too.
I don't need this.

472
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,824
Not the business itself, why my honor?

473
00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:46,338
- Yes.
- Yes.

474
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,379
Do as you wish, Mr. Bhagatram.

475
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:52,694
- Whether we have business ties or not...
- You get the respect here.

476
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:55,702
You made me happy.  No problem.

477
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:57,222
If not the whole
garden, half is fine.

478
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,888
Mr. Thakur, I will sign it
and submit it to the office.

479
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,050
Did you see Mr. Thakur?  If
Bhagatram ever suffered a loss.

480
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,479
He does not agree
to sign so soon.

481
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:12,050
But Rajesh, to whom have you given
the contract for the rest of the garden?

482
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,099
- No one yet.
- What does it mean?

483
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,179
- I will explain it later.
- Okay.

484
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:20,718
- Priest, did you understand his trick?
- Sir, he is new here.

485
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:23,843
- Gradually he is getting better.
- If not, I will fix him.

486
00:39:23,923 --> 00:39:27,019
He can only be
here as my servant.

487
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,739
This manager...

488
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,036
- Right?
- Yes.

489
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,019
Bhagatram's sister, read my palm.

490
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:42,419
Tell me about my future.

491
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:46,442
the future...?  You are only
there to dream and work.

492
00:39:46,562 --> 00:39:49,899
No.  That priest...

493
00:39:49,979 --> 00:39:53,019
- Who?
- One who plays.

494
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:58,793
- Yes.
- He read my palm and told me that someday I will be king.

495
00:39:58,873 --> 00:40:02,729
And he said that the person
I love will be my queen.

496
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:06,859
- Let me read your palm.
- What if my brother sees you?

497
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:11,259
so what?  I am not afraid of him.
I beat him.

498
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,779
No.  He beats me.

499
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:16,459
- I'm afraid of him.
- What are you doing here?

500
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:19,411
I told a story to your sister.

501
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:23,657
Shall I tell you that too?  There
were two male and female sparrows.

502
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:27,139
Both were in love
with each other.

503
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,779
A crow came there.

504
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:34,890
shut up  Aren't you
ashamed to talk to her alone?

505
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,379
Tell him I told a story.

506
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:41,123
You are an employee.

507
00:40:41,203 --> 00:40:42,899
She is the sister of a contractor.

508
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:45,410
You don't deserve her.  right?

509
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,168
No.  I am not an employee.

510
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:49,891
I am right Kumar.

511
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:51,817
Rajendra Kumar's son...

512
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:55,195
-...and a close friend of Mr. Thakur.
- I am complaining to Mr. Thakur.

513
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:58,059
If you don't listen, I'll
tie you up and whip you.

514
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:00,179
Get out of here!

515
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:03,259
A shameless girl.  go inside  I
will tell you a story.  Come on.

516
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:08,099
Meena Miss, Hariya said
you called me.  Is it urgent?

517
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:12,099
- Miss Meena.
- Mr. Rajesh, you?

518
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:15,099
I was engaged in reading.

519
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,379
please sit down.

520
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:18,259
what's up

521
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:21,339
Forget work.

522
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:25,116
listen to this  What a beautiful match.

523
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:30,544
It mentions a person who is 6 feet tall.

524
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:36,429
And alone with a beautiful girl.

525
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:42,050
- Mr. Rajesh, can you guess what happened next?
- No, I can't.

526
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,499
No problem.  I will tell you.

527
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:50,050
- The girl and the boy looked at each other lovingly.
- Okay.

528
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,499
The boy grabbed the girl's hand.

529
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:56,099
The girl felt still.

530
00:41:56,648 --> 00:42:00,659
The boy looked at the
girl's face with both hands.

531
00:42:01,057 --> 00:42:06,379
Both were so close that they
could feel each other's breath.

532
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,835
No, my God.

533
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:14,103
He is a city boy, I
am a country girl.

534
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:17,792
No, God.  No, my God.

535
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:23,407
No, God. No, God.

536
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:26,766
No, God.  No, my God.  No.

537
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:28,495
He is a city boy, I
am a country girl.

538
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,099
He is a city boy, I
am a country girl.

539
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:32,103
He is a city boy, I
am a country girl.

540
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:38,527
Mr. Rajesh.  Mr. Rajesh.

541
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:41,250
He is urban, I am rural.
I don't deserve his love.

542
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,409
Dispel this darkness.

543
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:44,657
Mr. Rajesh.  No, God.

544
00:42:44,777 --> 00:42:47,223
Yes, God.

545
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:50,887
Today my merit is wasted.

546
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:53,705
No problem, God.
I'm starting it again.

547
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:56,134
No, God.

548
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:59,033
- What happened to you?
- who is?

549
00:42:59,153 --> 00:43:01,229
- Rajesh.
- Rajesh.

550
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:05,149
You are in my thoughts and even
in front of me.  You are everywhere.

551
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:07,069
Why did you come here?

552
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:09,269
you called me

553
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:11,969
- I am?
- Yes.  I chanted.

554
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,145
- Mr. Rajesh.
- Yes?

555
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:14,829
- There is a problem.
- what?

556
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,714
- Do you believe in astrology?
- Yes.

557
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,996
- why?
- I believe that too.

558
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:25,656
An astrologer told me
that someone is coming.

559
00:43:26,016 --> 00:43:29,829
he came  He said he was not
from the village but from the city.

560
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:34,149
that is true.  He said
his name starts with "R".

561
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,589
that is true.  Someone driving a box said.

562
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:39,509
- You are the one who does it.
- A box?

563
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:41,549
It's the vehicle you drive.

564
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:42,989
The name is correct.  Career is OK.

565
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:45,149
- Okay, Mr. Rajesh?
- What now?

566
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:51,829
Don't ask me that.
He said he was falling in love.

567
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:57,749
- what?
- You don't understand anything.

568
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:00,309
We are not compatible.
You are from the city.

569
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,383
I am from the village.
A worthless person.

570
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:06,829
tell the truth

571
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:10,302
Listen to me first.

572
00:44:12,977 --> 00:44:16,083
So to get rid of this troublesome
love the astrologer said...

573
00:44:16,203 --> 00:44:20,232
...to sit here for 30 days and chant
the phrase ``No God'' 330 times.

574
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:23,930
But you say "Yes
God and Mr. Rajesh".

575
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,909
- That's the problem.
- Yes.

576
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:29,625
I say "no god" on
astrologer advice.

577
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:32,951
But after a while I start
saying "Oh my God".

578
00:44:33,669 --> 00:44:37,568
Why is this happening?
What is happening to me now?

579
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:40,829
I don't know that.
But something happened to me too.

580
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:43,961
why is that  Is something
bothering you too?

581
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,589
Not one but two.

582
00:44:46,774 --> 00:44:47,989
Two problems.

583
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:50,721
Lord Ram.  Lord Ram!

584
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,349
Dad, drink tea.

585
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,130
Dad, drink tea.

586
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:02,069
Why did you stay outside?
Get in.

587
00:45:02,274 --> 00:45:03,589
hurry up.

588
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:05,649
Take the basket down.

589
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:09,471
Take this away.

590
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:11,511
- Bhagatram.
- Welcome.

591
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:15,111
I told you not to come in.

592
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:18,666
A girl is here.
Talk before you come in.

593
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:23,063
- Why did you bring this basket?
- You get angry before you know it.

594
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:25,409
When angry, you
don't listen to anyone.

595
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:27,088
This is apple growing season.

596
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:30,713
So I thought to give
it to my relatives first.

597
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,247
Taruna, go inside.

598
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:38,428
Bhagatram.  I have often
said that I do not like your work.

599
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:40,504
Take this basket back.

600
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:42,598
But this is a common
custom among relatives.

601
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:44,684
Who said you are my relative?

602
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:48,175
Father-in-law, you always
forget that, don't you?

603
00:45:48,438 --> 00:45:51,392
The whole village knows
that she is my girlfriend.

604
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:55,198
- We got engaged when we were young.
- But I never accepted this.

605
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:56,958
all right.

606
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,678
You should think about it
when we get engaged, right?

607
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:03,518
Taruna's mother promised my mother.

608
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:06,318
- But now both are dead.
- So I die too?

609
00:46:06,438 --> 00:46:09,278
I don't care if you live or die,
but this marriage is not happening.

610
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:13,278
- Does that mean I should remain single?
- I don't have time for nonsense.

611
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:16,716
If you don't leave soon, I will
yell at you and throw you out.

612
00:46:17,032 --> 00:46:22,248
Father-in-law, whether you like
it or not, I will tell you something.

613
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:26,558
No one can send a proposal to
this house as long as I am alive.

614
00:46:27,038 --> 00:46:31,065
- Taruna will marry only me.
- Bhagatram!

615
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,078
These arguments are futile.

616
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:34,558
eat apple  They are really tasty.

617
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:41,882
Don't cry, daughter.

618
00:46:42,695 --> 00:46:46,961
You will not be punished
for your mother's mistake...

619
00:46:47,018 --> 00:46:49,438
...as long as I live.

620
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,607
People like Bhagatram
cannot harm you.

621
00:46:56,758 --> 00:47:01,292
Dad, you are so good.

622
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:06,558
- My child.
- Did you drink tea?

623
00:47:06,578 --> 00:47:08,358
I will bring

624
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,798
Did you see how I tricked him?

625
00:47:23,158 --> 00:47:24,878
He thought he was very clever.

626
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:27,438
Let's stop acting now.

627
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,438
- If we find out about this, we will be in trouble.
- You are a coward.

628
00:47:30,718 --> 00:47:32,558
Will someone hang us?

629
00:47:32,878 --> 00:47:35,678
I am Thakur's daughter.
No one can tell me anything.

630
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:38,038
Still, bullying someone is wrong.

631
00:47:38,878 --> 00:47:40,638
Why do you pity him?

632
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:42,358
do you love him

633
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,838
You worry for him.

634
00:47:44,918 --> 00:47:47,538
I tell you to stop these
jokes, but you ignore me.

635
00:47:47,558 --> 00:47:49,118
I enjoy this joke.

636
00:47:49,798 --> 00:47:54,238
He must be thinking he's very
lucky to have two girls following him.

637
00:47:54,558 --> 00:47:57,358
But he doesn't know
that we are deceiving him.

638
00:47:57,798 --> 00:47:59,998
How long will you cheat on him?

639
00:48:00,118 --> 00:48:01,531
Let's fool him as long as possible.

640
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,930
There is no other
entertainment here.

641
00:48:07,558 --> 00:48:11,004
Now let's see who is cheating whom.

642
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:20,078
Sister of Bhagatram.

643
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:24,558
- Be my wife.
- you idiot.

644
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:28,078
- Do you know what will happen if my brother asks?
- What will happen?

645
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:30,598
Let's get married.  what else

646
00:48:30,718 --> 00:48:32,798
Let's get married.  what else

647
00:48:33,308 --> 00:48:36,708
My brother will kick you out.

648
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:40,009
There is a gap between us

649
00:48:40,358 --> 00:48:46,558
My brother is a big contractor and
you are an employee of Mr. Thakur.

650
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:50,998
I am marrying not your brother.

651
00:48:51,118 --> 00:48:54,918
- So who will you marry?
- With that brother's maid.

652
00:48:55,038 --> 00:48:57,638
So I am a maid.

653
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:01,678
I am helping Mr. Thakur.
You call me his servant.

654
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:04,918
I call you a servant because
you do so much for my brother.

655
00:49:05,038 --> 00:49:06,918
Okay, don't tell me that.

656
00:49:07,038 --> 00:49:09,118
Then don't call
me a servant either.

657
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,798
- Then what should I say?
- Say anything.

658
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:15,358
- But don't say my name.
- Why is that?

659
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:20,638
The wife-to-be does not
say her husband's name.

660
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,498
My beloved!

661
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:28,638
Go and wash your beautiful face.

662
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,358
Wash my face?

663
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:35,638
ok

664
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:43,916
why are you looking at me

665
00:49:44,638 --> 00:49:48,358
I swear I didn't
think I looked at you.

666
00:49:49,038 --> 00:49:52,383
Eyes may have looked
at you unconsciously.

667
00:49:53,038 --> 00:49:54,488
What happened to you today?

668
00:49:54,878 --> 00:49:58,238
Don't be surprised if my
heart is restless today.

669
00:49:58,638 --> 00:50:00,798
It was full of passion.

670
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:02,598
- The heart declares it.
- is it!.

671
00:50:02,638 --> 00:50:03,718
Then you have become a poet.

672
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:08,118
Miss Meena I saw a beautiful image last night.

673
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:13,078
She looks like a fairy from the sky.

674
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:18,445
Her face is very beautiful.

675
00:50:19,346 --> 00:50:26,038
And her clothes are
precious and her eyes are big.

676
00:50:26,241 --> 00:50:29,428
And her cheeks are pink.

677
00:50:29,748 --> 00:50:36,358
- Meena, I feel it every time I see you.
- what?

678
00:50:36,657 --> 00:50:42,318
The image seen at night seems to have come to life.

679
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:45,438
- You make me uncomfortable.
- I should be ashamed too.

680
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,198
Because I couldn't
praise you properly.

681
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:51,238
I have no words.

682
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:58,546
Miss Meena, when you walk, even
the stones on the road turn into flowers.

683
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,350
What a beautiful journey!

684
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,582
Are you back?

685
00:56:18,948 --> 00:56:21,422
They told me to wash my face.

686
00:56:21,662 --> 00:56:24,102
I washed my face.  Still wet.

687
00:56:24,222 --> 00:56:25,342
Catch it.

688
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,902
- If someone sees you outside?
- Then let me in.

689
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:33,769
- What if someone sees you inside?
- Then let me out.

690
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:36,302
Will no one see this coming?

691
00:56:36,422 --> 00:56:40,222
It's okay to see them.
Someday everyone will see us.

692
00:56:40,342 --> 00:56:43,130
you idiot!  My brother will kill you then.

693
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,542
- Oh, my God.
- Were you scared?

694
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:48,382
- I am not afraid.
- No?

695
00:56:48,502 --> 00:56:51,478
Okay, what are you doing here?

696
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,902
- Why do you change faces?
- Do you blame me?

697
00:56:55,982 --> 00:56:58,770
- Why did you come here?
- I came to tell you something.

698
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:03,831
- what?
- You get salary from Mr. Thakur.  But working for Bhagatram.

699
00:57:03,911 --> 00:57:06,422
You were nervous, weren't you?

700
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:11,756
I tried to blame him.
But he did that to me.

701
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:28,036
You've been weird these days.

702
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,522
Yes... No...

703
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:31,922
wait a little.

704
00:57:32,892 --> 00:57:36,887
Your eyes show that
you haven't slept all night.

705
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,082
No... Yes...

706
00:57:39,818 --> 00:57:42,442
Yes and no.  What a strange answer.

707
00:57:42,944 --> 00:57:47,522
Taruna, look at me.

708
00:57:48,138 --> 00:57:50,162
I guess you haven't
slept all night either.

709
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:54,624
- I didn't sleep many nights.
- Why is that?

710
00:57:54,978 --> 00:57:59,842
I think someone is in
these eyes instead of sleepy.

711
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:01,682
who is that

712
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:07,891
- There is someone.
- tell me.

713
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,442
tell me.  who is she?

714
00:58:15,002 --> 00:58:16,293
- your.
- what?

715
00:58:16,522 --> 00:58:19,602
I mean if you meet me tomorrow.

716
00:58:20,528 --> 00:58:23,682
I will tell you about her.

717
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:29,362
- Why not now?
- Taruna, my heart is beating fast.

718
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:31,482
My throat is parched.

719
00:58:31,602 --> 00:58:36,282
If you meet me tomorrow
I will tell you everything.

720
00:58:36,749 --> 00:58:37,404
All...

721
00:58:37,524 --> 00:58:39,283
Tomorrow... where is it?

722
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,722
tomorrow?

723
00:58:40,842 --> 00:58:43,189
Do you see that hill?

724
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:45,322
Is it good there?

725
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:47,817
Yes, what time?

726
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:50,026
4 o'clock.  right?

727
00:58:51,484 --> 00:58:53,826
OK, I'll go now.

728
00:58:56,996 --> 00:58:58,322
- Taruna.
- Yes?

729
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:02,922
Keep this flower
safe if you can.

730
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,162
You are very beautiful.

731
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:11,622
So are you.

732
00:59:19,094 --> 00:59:21,297
tell me.  who is she?

733
00:59:21,886 --> 00:59:23,214
- You...
- Really?

734
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:28,609
If you meet me tomorrow
I will tell you everything.

735
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:31,134
why tomorrow  tell me now

736
00:59:31,254 --> 00:59:34,988
Meena, my heart is beating fast.

737
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:37,132
Take your hand away.
My heart is beating fast.

738
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:42,734
If you meet me tomorrow
you will know who he is.

739
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:46,981
I know it.
But I want to ask you that.

740
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:51,859
- Then meet me tomorrow and ask.
- Where?

741
00:59:52,492 --> 00:59:55,519
- Do you see that mountain behind the tree?
- Yes.

742
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:57,187
there  right?

743
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:59,468
ok  But at what time?

744
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,174
4 o'clock.  right?

745
01:00:01,594 --> 01:00:05,506
- Okay.
- Mina, shall I go now?

746
01:00:06,734 --> 01:00:07,774
are you leaving?

747
01:00:07,894 --> 01:00:08,974
Yes.  I have to go.

748
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:12,094
- Meena.
- Yes?

749
01:00:12,494 --> 01:00:18,294
Can you keep this flower safe?

750
01:00:18,598 --> 01:00:22,574
- you are very beautiful.
- You are also very beautiful.

751
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:49,579
are you here

752
01:00:51,486 --> 01:00:54,393
- On my way home.
- But your house is not on this side.

753
01:00:54,574 --> 01:00:57,228
- Why are you here?
- No.

754
01:00:57,308 --> 01:01:00,031
I thought I would sit here
for a while and then go home.

755
01:01:01,003 --> 01:01:03,163
I like this place very much.

756
01:01:03,814 --> 01:01:05,092
why did you come here

757
01:01:05,814 --> 01:01:09,118
I also wanted to
sit here for a while.

758
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:11,614
So let's sit down.

759
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,065
Yes.  Let's sit down.

760
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,685
Why are you silent?  talk

761
01:01:39,024 --> 01:01:41,002
Yes.  Let's talk.

762
01:01:42,334 --> 01:01:44,648
It's a very happy time, isn't it?

763
01:01:44,986 --> 01:01:47,146
Yes.  It's really fun.

764
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:50,974
- Why are you happy?
- I am...?

765
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:53,375
Because you came here.

766
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:56,574
I felt lonely when
you were in town.

767
01:01:56,774 --> 01:01:59,054
Now that you're here, I
have someone to talk to.

768
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,660
What do you have in your hand?

769
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:05,734
these?  It is a flower.

770
01:02:18,094 --> 01:02:19,550
Both flowers are the same.

771
01:02:22,654 --> 01:02:26,568
Did someone give you
this flower for safekeeping?

772
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,699
Yes.  and you?

773
01:02:32,094 --> 01:02:33,174
Same for me.

774
01:02:35,494 --> 01:02:40,348
Meena, is Rajesh
playing a joke with us?

775
01:02:40,932 --> 01:02:43,190
Is he fooling us?

776
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:48,920
I went to cheat him and got cheated myself.

777
01:02:55,414 --> 01:02:56,494
Meena.

778
01:02:57,069 --> 01:03:03,171
Taruna, now stop the
game I told you to play.

779
01:03:04,174 --> 01:03:05,254
Does that mean?

780
01:03:05,832 --> 01:03:09,696
That means I have
really loved Rajesh.

781
01:03:10,146 --> 01:03:11,894
Now this joke has come true for me.

782
01:03:12,863 --> 01:03:16,421
If you have any feelings
about Rajesh, forget it.

783
01:03:16,611 --> 01:03:19,254
And you are going
to marry Bhagatram.

784
01:03:42,616 --> 01:03:47,033
I apply lipstick.

785
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:54,010
I apply lipstick.

786
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,056
Now my eyes are red.

787
01:03:58,351 --> 01:04:04,031
No one will look bad
because I wore these.

788
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:09,991
This pie is good.

789
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:14,947
Eat some of this.

790
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:24,362
- What are you doing?
- I ate lipstick.

791
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:29,714
Why is the lady looking like this?

792
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:33,409
- I was looking at your beautiful face.
- Do you like that?

793
01:04:33,529 --> 01:04:38,151
- so many.
- Then Bhagatram's sister will also like it.

794
01:04:38,271 --> 01:04:41,211
I go to her like a prince.

795
01:04:41,331 --> 01:04:43,419
You look like a
monkey, not a prince.

796
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:47,000
Monkeys are black.  I'm blushing now.

797
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:47,950
okay

798
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:50,695
Dad, look.
He finished my makeup kit.

799
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:53,198
- No, Mr. Thakur.
- Shut up.

800
01:04:53,664 --> 01:04:57,031
I have heard that you are
misbehaving with Bhagatram's sister.

801
01:04:57,151 --> 01:05:00,269
Thugs are the ones
who misbehave with girls.

802
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:02,769
I am dating her.

803
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:05,391
Love stories... have you forgotten your status?

804
01:05:05,511 --> 01:05:08,289
You are an employee.  She
is the sister of a contractor.

805
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:09,871
You are dating her.

806
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:13,031
- Only contractors can love?
- Shut up.

807
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:16,577
If you do this
again, I will fire you.

808
01:05:16,697 --> 01:05:18,271
- Father, let him.
- No, you keep quiet.

809
01:05:18,438 --> 01:05:20,770
Get out of here.

810
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:23,682
my goodness!

811
01:05:33,633 --> 01:05:38,591
God, why did you make me a servant?

812
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,730
Why wasn't I made king?

813
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:47,282
Why did you not make
Thakur my servant?

814
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:50,511
Why didn't you make
Bhagatram my servant?

815
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,939
Why wasn't I made king?

816
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:02,030
Why wasn't I made king?

817
01:07:40,986 --> 01:07:42,351
Prime Minister

818
01:07:43,819 --> 01:07:46,391
Has morning church started?

819
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:48,871
Yes, Your Majesty!

820
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:52,791
May I make a request,
with your permission?

821
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:54,351
Yes.

822
01:07:54,817 --> 01:07:58,671
Do the contractor Bhagatram a favor.

823
01:07:59,281 --> 01:08:03,391
Tell Bhagatram to
let me marry his sister.

824
01:08:03,511 --> 01:08:09,471
Want to marry a normal girl.
It is against your honor.

825
01:08:09,591 --> 01:08:13,871
If you don't change your
mind, people will not pay taxes.

826
01:08:14,274 --> 01:08:17,785
The army revolted...

827
01:08:17,905 --> 01:08:19,351
...the kingdom will be a graveyard.

828
01:08:19,688 --> 01:08:23,991
Stop.

829
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:26,631
I am a warrior too.

830
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,378
You will lose your kingdom.

831
01:08:29,498 --> 01:08:32,500
What do you lose?
I ask for something.

832
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,996
right?

833
01:08:34,116 --> 01:08:37,351
The world will become your enemy.

834
01:08:37,471 --> 01:08:42,351
Shut up or I won't spare you.

835
01:08:42,606 --> 01:08:48,105
My love, where is
the joy in my life?

836
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:49,671
bring her

837
01:08:52,205 --> 01:08:54,035
I have come, my lord.

838
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:59,704
But for my love I will
not destroy your kingdom.

839
01:08:59,824 --> 01:09:02,911
- Don't say that, love.
- No.

840
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:09,471
I offer my love.
I'm going to the Himalayas.

841
01:09:10,632 --> 01:09:15,956
I leave.

842
01:09:16,202 --> 01:09:20,249
Beloved, look at this.

843
01:09:21,823 --> 01:09:23,111
No.

844
01:09:24,843 --> 01:09:29,199
Bhagatram's sister,
to be my bride.

845
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:31,415
It doesn't matter if I lose
my wealth or my kingdom.

846
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:33,231
As I fell in love with you.

847
01:14:03,316 --> 01:14:06,396
Hari Singh's daughter is getting married the next day.

848
01:14:06,686 --> 01:14:08,516
I might forget, so remind me.

849
01:14:08,796 --> 01:14:11,596
Tell Meena to get ready.

850
01:14:11,904 --> 01:14:14,746
Sir, you attend other
people's weddings.

851
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:18,516
Have you thought about
having a wedding at your home?

852
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:22,556
- Are you asking about Mina?
- Yes, sir!

853
01:14:23,194 --> 01:14:24,796
You have one daughter.

854
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:29,145
I am also thinking about her marriage.
I want to find a good young man.

855
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:31,636
- We have a young man in our own house, sir?
- Who is that?

856
01:14:32,096 --> 01:14:34,964
- Rajesh.
- Rajesh.

857
01:14:35,854 --> 01:14:39,576
He is a good young man, but we know
nothing about his family background.

858
01:14:39,955 --> 01:14:42,893
- You can find out if you ask.
- I will definitely ask.

859
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:45,016
Thanks for the reminder.

860
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:49,051
I like Rajesh.

861
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,202
You go now.

862
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:03,014
why so?

863
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:06,022
I'm here now.

864
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,016
Look, Taruni!  This is not right.

865
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:13,704
You teased me, but you
got angry when I did it.

866
01:15:14,057 --> 01:15:16,185
- Who made fun of you?
- your...

867
01:15:16,376 --> 01:15:18,622
...and your friend Mina.

868
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,813
It is not true.

869
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:26,362
"He probably thinks he's lucky
because two girls are crazy about him."

870
01:15:26,482 --> 01:15:28,642
"He doesn't know
we're tricking him."

871
01:15:28,762 --> 01:15:31,722
- Who said that then?
- You are very bad.

872
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:33,642
You listen to girls talk.

873
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:38,882
And two girls are cheating
on an innocent boy.  is it right?

874
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:43,082
So, that's why you called both of
us at the same time to get revenge.

875
01:15:43,202 --> 01:15:46,303
- Not revenge, just a joke.
- a joke...?

876
01:15:48,482 --> 01:15:50,762
This joke has now become a reality.

877
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:54,224
I wanted to tell
you the same thing.

878
01:15:54,344 --> 01:15:56,949
This joke has become a reality.

879
01:16:06,971 --> 01:16:10,911
Then, Meena got her love.

880
01:16:11,922 --> 01:16:13,401
- To Meena...?
- Yes.

881
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:19,111
I don't love Meena.

882
01:16:22,393 --> 01:16:23,642
That's for you.

883
01:16:24,725 --> 01:16:25,921
Yes.

884
01:16:27,171 --> 01:16:28,463
to you.

885
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,889
- Right...?
- Yes, sir.

886
01:21:37,248 --> 01:21:40,369
You can get anything
you want with your wealth.

887
01:21:40,489 --> 01:21:44,089
No priest.  Wealth is useless.

888
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:50,333
- Why is that?
- I want to give up my wealth for poor her.

889
01:21:50,453 --> 01:21:53,769
- Who is she, sir?
- My girlfriend, Taruna.

890
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:56,089
- And that...?
- Rajesh.

891
01:21:56,109 --> 01:21:59,229
Is this world no place
for a good man like you?

892
01:21:59,328 --> 01:22:02,509
Take my example.  I get
salary from Mr. Thakur.

893
01:22:02,528 --> 01:22:04,409
But I work for you.

894
01:22:04,598 --> 01:22:06,649
That's why I will give
you a good advice.

895
01:22:07,113 --> 01:22:11,097
Get the girl just
like you got rich.

896
01:22:17,665 --> 01:22:20,616
Take this axe.
I bow before you.

897
01:22:20,868 --> 01:22:24,085
- Beat my head off with an axe.
- Let me go.  keep away.

898
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:28,853
If you're mine, I won't
bother you again.

899
01:22:28,973 --> 01:22:31,246
- Have you seen your face in the mirror?
- Yes.

900
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:33,933
I am better than your Rajesh.

901
01:22:34,053 --> 01:22:37,453
Do you want to
compete with Mr. Rajesh?

902
01:22:37,898 --> 01:22:41,808
- Bhagatram is not afraid to compete with anyone.
- Leave me alone.

903
01:22:41,928 --> 01:22:49,271
What I can't get by
love, I get by force.

904
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:02,594
leave me alone

905
01:23:03,174 --> 01:23:08,330
From today you belong
only to me.  right?

906
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:10,464
leave me alone

907
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:17,899
run?

908
01:23:19,683 --> 01:23:22,127
- Leave me alone.
- How is that?

909
01:23:22,207 --> 01:23:24,386
come here

910
01:23:24,999 --> 01:23:30,704
leave me alone  leave me alone

911
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:36,690
- Help me.  help me
- Shut up.

912
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:43,695
leave me alone  help me

913
01:24:31,896 --> 01:24:36,361
I have heard that no one can
compete with you in wrestling.

914
01:24:36,441 --> 01:24:39,264
You should not
use the other hand.

915
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:47,583
I can fight well.

916
01:25:21,922 --> 01:25:24,944
Isn't that right?

917
01:25:32,365 --> 01:25:34,805
I will not spare you.

918
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:44,456
Did you come now?  I didn't see.

919
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,496
I'm coming with a parade
to get your attention.

920
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:51,541
- You should also wear the groom's suit on that day.
- I am ready.

921
01:25:51,661 --> 01:25:53,979
When should I bring
the wedding procession?

922
01:25:54,099 --> 01:25:55,176
You are very stubborn

923
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:57,296
If someone listens to us?

924
01:25:57,416 --> 01:25:58,736
Don't know about others.

925
01:25:59,214 --> 01:26:01,736
But I am very happy
if your father hears it.

926
01:26:02,016 --> 01:26:03,256
my goodness.  why is that

927
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:07,680
I touch his feet and
ask consent for this.

928
01:26:08,988 --> 01:26:10,896
I will say that your
daughter consented.

929
01:26:11,701 --> 01:26:15,237
No.  You should never say that.

930
01:26:16,101 --> 01:26:20,176
- Why is that?
- I don't deserve you.

931
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:23,416
That's absolutely right.

932
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:25,896
I'm not pretty like you.

933
01:26:26,016 --> 01:26:29,656
- You don't take these seriously.
- Is this wrong?

934
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:33,736
I thought I would talk
to your father today.

935
01:26:34,176 --> 01:26:38,176
I now believe in heaven.

936
01:26:39,016 --> 01:26:42,456
Maybe that's why fate
brought us together.

937
01:26:42,576 --> 01:26:44,176
You will protect my honor.

938
01:26:44,896 --> 01:26:46,736
You will save me from disgrace.

939
01:26:47,615 --> 01:26:50,056
And you will marry me.

940
01:26:50,176 --> 01:26:52,336
It makes me shudder to think about it.

941
01:26:52,912 --> 01:26:56,104
What would happen to me if
you didn't come there that day?

942
01:26:56,224 --> 01:26:57,647
No.

943
01:26:58,261 --> 01:27:00,987
Don't think so.

944
01:27:01,336 --> 01:27:06,336
We should be grateful to
life for bringing us closer.

945
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:16,216
A small gift as a souvenir.

946
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,576
- Sir.
- why?

947
01:27:35,696 --> 01:27:39,056
Sir lorry motor arrived.

948
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:40,364
Lorry motor?

949
01:27:40,484 --> 01:27:43,296
- Yes, that long one.
- What nonsense.

950
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:45,872
Mr. Thakur, I called a truck.
It must have been brought.

951
01:27:45,896 --> 01:27:50,176
- Why is that?
- Please forgive me, you don't know much about business.

952
01:27:50,456 --> 01:27:52,751
I gave half of the estate to Bhagatram.

953
01:27:52,871 --> 01:27:55,392
Then the other half of the fruit can
be sold directly to us in the market.

954
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:59,416
Then you can know about
your profit and his loss.

955
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:03,331
You say Bhagatram is a fraud.

956
01:28:03,451 --> 01:28:04,654
Yes, definitely.

957
01:28:04,774 --> 01:28:08,265
- What am I doing?
- Send that truck driver in.

958
01:28:08,385 --> 01:28:10,216
ok  I will do that.

959
01:28:10,336 --> 01:28:11,416
Go quickly.

960
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,896
Gauri.  Where did she go again?

961
01:28:14,413 --> 01:28:16,656
Fool, are you back here?

962
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:21,096
- I came to give you a message.
- What message?

963
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,056
- You're fired.
- Why is that?

964
01:28:24,176 --> 01:28:27,456
Earlier you got half of the estate.

965
01:28:27,576 --> 01:28:29,552
Now even that will not be available.

966
01:28:29,576 --> 01:28:32,576
- Why is that?
- Mr. Thakur and Mr. Rajesh...

967
01:28:32,676 --> 01:28:34,776
...Talked to a factory owner.

968
01:28:34,896 --> 01:28:39,696
They are going to build a factory
on that land in partnership with him.

969
01:28:40,296 --> 01:28:45,216
- But how does he do that?
- Ask Mr. Rajesh.

970
01:28:45,336 --> 01:28:47,496
Ask soon or he
will leave tomorrow.

971
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:51,176
Your theft has been exposed.

972
01:28:51,494 --> 01:28:53,365
Is he going tomorrow?

973
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:57,278
He does not know what to do?

974
01:29:01,056 --> 01:29:03,490
What will you give me in the city?

975
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,256
Say whatever you want.

976
01:29:05,376 --> 01:29:06,496
Anything you like.

977
01:29:06,793 --> 01:29:09,986
Then I will bring you a
beautiful saree from the city.

978
01:29:10,106 --> 01:29:12,176
I don't wear them.

979
01:29:12,296 --> 01:29:15,816
- Then a skirt like this.
- Get them here.

980
01:29:16,221 --> 01:29:19,816
I will bring jewelry.

981
01:29:20,449 --> 01:29:23,658
The train leaves at two thirty.

982
01:29:23,778 --> 01:29:27,616
It's already two.  Say what you want.

983
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,576
- So shall I tell you?
- Yes.

984
01:33:57,651 --> 01:33:59,132
Come on!

985
01:34:19,099 --> 01:34:20,236
Rajesh.

986
01:34:20,556 --> 01:34:22,796
What happened?

987
01:34:23,056 --> 01:34:25,208
Rajesh!  Look, son.

988
01:34:25,436 --> 01:34:27,756
open your eyes  Your mother came.

989
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:30,742
- Rajesh.
- Thugs attacked him.

990
01:34:30,862 --> 01:34:32,636
We still don't know who they are.

991
01:34:32,808 --> 01:34:34,126
Rajesh.

992
01:34:34,246 --> 01:34:36,036
The doctor said there
was nothing to worry about.

993
01:34:36,596 --> 01:34:39,796
He has been given medicine.
you calm down

994
01:34:40,321 --> 01:34:43,356
Until he comes to his senses, come on.

995
01:34:56,937 --> 01:34:59,733
Sir, this is Rajesh's mother.

996
01:34:59,853 --> 01:35:01,178
Rajesh's mother!

997
01:35:02,627 --> 01:35:04,417
Look at her.

998
01:35:05,537 --> 01:35:06,617
Come on.

999
01:35:12,067 --> 01:35:15,215
I was scared when the thugs hit.

1000
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:17,795
I could not imagine
what would happen.

1001
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:22,627
Nothing happens to me
when you are with me.

1002
01:35:22,747 --> 01:35:25,409
Dad asked why you didn't
complain to the police.

1003
01:35:25,529 --> 01:35:27,067
There is no such need.

1004
01:35:27,187 --> 01:35:28,907
I can control those thugs.

1005
01:35:29,384 --> 01:35:31,114
I know who they are.

1006
01:35:31,387 --> 01:35:34,387
- who are they?
- I'll tell you later.

1007
01:35:34,618 --> 01:35:35,980
Rajesh.

1008
01:35:36,567 --> 01:35:37,567
Mother.

1009
01:35:38,888 --> 01:35:41,827
- Hello, aunt.
- bless you.

1010
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:45,187
- who is she?
- Mom, she is Taruna.

1011
01:35:45,307 --> 01:35:47,387
Daughter of Mr. Shyamlal.

1012
01:35:47,931 --> 01:35:49,483
Shyamlal.

1013
01:35:49,698 --> 01:35:51,589
- The toy maker?
- Yes.

1014
01:35:51,709 --> 01:35:52,827
Taruna, sit down.

1015
01:35:53,342 --> 01:35:55,107
I will go now.  I'll come back later.

1016
01:35:55,364 --> 01:35:56,364
ok

1017
01:36:00,307 --> 01:36:03,515
- Why did she come here, Rajesh?
- To meet me.

1018
01:36:04,108 --> 01:36:08,067
Mother Taruna is a very good girl.

1019
01:36:09,267 --> 01:36:13,467
A group attacked my
manager Mr. Rajesh.

1020
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:16,187
They tried to kill him.

1021
01:36:16,307 --> 01:36:20,147
Rajesh is not only my manager
but also a stranger in our village.

1022
01:36:20,532 --> 01:36:22,812
It's a shame for us...

1023
01:36:22,932 --> 01:36:24,947
...that a guest was treated like that.

1024
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:29,019
The village court wants to
know who did this and why?

1025
01:36:29,387 --> 01:36:31,987
Mr. Rajesh who do you suspect?

1026
01:36:32,747 --> 01:36:34,907
Who is your enemy?

1027
01:36:35,147 --> 01:36:36,922
What could be the cause of hostility?

1028
01:36:40,547 --> 01:36:44,627
Does your silence show
that you don't know?

1029
01:36:44,825 --> 01:36:49,114
- I can't say.
- Why is that?

1030
01:36:49,234 --> 01:36:53,227
It takes courage to accuse
someone in the village court.

1031
01:36:53,347 --> 01:36:55,907
- He can't say that.
- Why is that?

1032
01:36:56,230 --> 01:36:59,307
Because a dishonored man
cannot accuse an honorable one.

1033
01:36:59,771 --> 01:37:01,227
But it is happening.

1034
01:37:01,467 --> 01:37:04,067
I apologize to the village court.

1035
01:37:04,427 --> 01:37:08,138
I am also a resident of this village.

1036
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:12,227
Our honor is the honor of the village.

1037
01:37:12,547 --> 01:37:15,351
Whoever tries to
disrespect our village...

1038
01:37:15,471 --> 01:37:18,054
- Gotta face the consequences, right?
- Yes.

1039
01:37:18,174 --> 01:37:20,347
it is good.  What do
you mean by that now?

1040
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:22,313
Mr. Thakur, you are not the only one…

1041
01:37:22,433 --> 01:37:25,027
...The whole village knows
that Taruna is my girlfriend.

1042
01:37:25,147 --> 01:37:27,387
And the girlfriend is the person
who is going to be the wife.

1043
01:37:27,564 --> 01:37:32,497
Can anyone tolerate someone
else flirting with their wife?

1044
01:37:32,617 --> 01:37:36,587
- Don't kill him?
- Yes.

1045
01:37:36,707 --> 01:37:39,751
Mr. Thakur, you tell him that
you are a guest in this village.

1046
01:37:39,871 --> 01:37:43,067
If asked about his
relationship with Taruna?

1047
01:37:43,515 --> 01:37:47,227
Mr. Contract, today the
village court wants to know…

1048
01:37:47,718 --> 01:37:51,787
...only about who attacked
me, not my personal matters.

1049
01:37:52,123 --> 01:37:53,467
Your personal matters?

1050
01:37:53,814 --> 01:37:57,227
Are you flirting with
innocent village girls?

1051
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,002
How can you say that?

1052
01:37:59,122 --> 01:38:01,707
Mr. Thakur, if I
begin to tell his story.

1053
01:38:01,827 --> 01:38:03,488
It will take a very long time.

1054
01:38:03,508 --> 01:38:06,995
Suffice it to say that he has
been rudely treated for evidence.

1055
01:38:07,019 --> 01:38:10,947
Mr. Thakur tell him not to
drag my daughter's name into it.

1056
01:38:10,981 --> 01:38:14,086
- Are you the boss here?
- Not someone else's...

1057
01:38:14,206 --> 01:38:17,156
...I am definitely Taruna's
lover and your son-in-law.

1058
01:38:17,276 --> 01:38:20,372
- Shut up.
- Father-in-law, why are you angry?

1059
01:38:20,492 --> 01:38:23,732
If you don't like me, why did
you allow this relationship?

1060
01:38:23,852 --> 01:38:26,395
Aren't you ashamed to
lie in the village court?

1061
01:38:26,515 --> 01:38:28,115
I told you often...

1062
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:30,305
...that this is a childhood friendship.

1063
01:38:30,425 --> 01:38:33,252
But you are trying to force it.

1064
01:38:33,486 --> 01:38:35,932
If you say so...

1065
01:38:36,098 --> 01:38:38,391
...I declare in front of everyone.

1066
01:38:38,511 --> 01:38:40,372
I will marry Taruna.

1067
01:38:40,492 --> 01:38:42,972
It is a matter of my honor.
Is that right Mr. Thakur?

1068
01:38:43,092 --> 01:38:45,743
I also declare this
in front of everyone.

1069
01:38:45,863 --> 01:38:48,492
I only like a young man…

1070
01:38:48,974 --> 01:38:50,673
...my daughter wants to get married.

1071
01:38:50,793 --> 01:38:52,732
To fill her life with
happiness and not sadness.

1072
01:38:53,096 --> 01:38:56,229
I deal with Apple.
I will not make her sad.

1073
01:38:56,349 --> 01:38:58,749
Who doesn't want to
make their wife happy!

1074
01:38:59,349 --> 01:39:01,150
Shyamlal, being
stubborn is not right.

1075
01:39:01,409 --> 01:39:02,976
It's been years.

1076
01:39:03,096 --> 01:39:06,149
You should marry
Taruna to Bhagatram.

1077
01:39:06,269 --> 01:39:08,989
It is something related
to his honor and life.

1078
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:10,189
Mr. Thakur.

1079
01:39:11,015 --> 01:39:14,629
Why don't you say I want
to strangle my daughter?

1080
01:39:14,934 --> 01:39:16,029
It is impossible.

1081
01:39:16,434 --> 01:39:18,501
Do you not accept the
decision of the village court?

1082
01:39:18,525 --> 01:39:21,909
If you don't accept it, you
have to leave the village.

1083
01:39:22,029 --> 01:39:24,549
Mr. Thakur, I think
your decision is right.

1084
01:39:24,669 --> 01:39:26,629
We think so too.

1085
01:39:26,749 --> 01:39:28,189
What kind of village court is this?

1086
01:39:28,698 --> 01:39:32,376
This suppresses the
truth and supports the lie.

1087
01:39:32,496 --> 01:39:35,469
Mr. Thakur, Members
of Rural Courts Hon.

1088
01:39:35,589 --> 01:39:38,549
Do not hear what is said?

1089
01:39:38,669 --> 01:39:40,349
- Yes.
- It is wrong.

1090
01:39:40,829 --> 01:39:44,189
Imagine if you were
in Mr. Shyamlal's place.

1091
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:48,309
Do you respect them
after this decision?

1092
01:39:48,429 --> 01:39:49,509
no way.

1093
01:39:50,029 --> 01:39:52,829
Mr. Thakur, don't
give such a verdict.

1094
01:39:53,097 --> 01:39:55,509
Losing faith in
the village court.

1095
01:39:55,629 --> 01:39:58,149
Mr. Thakur, your judgment
is always in favor of truth.

1096
01:39:58,269 --> 01:39:59,886
Come on, get up.

1097
01:40:04,189 --> 01:40:05,589
I'm telling the truth.

1098
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:09,429
No, son.
You should not say all that.

1099
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:11,749
Mr. Thakur felt very uncomfortable.

1100
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:15,648
Truth is always bitter
to dishonest people.

1101
01:40:16,265 --> 01:40:19,087
- What are you saying son?
- I'm fine, mom.

1102
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:22,652
It is Mr. Thakur's decision and
not the decision of the village court.

1103
01:40:22,841 --> 01:40:26,260
For the sake of Meena's happiness,
the youth is being treated unfairly.

1104
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:29,487
But I won't let that happen.

1105
01:40:30,076 --> 01:40:34,436
Mr. Thakur's money can buy someone
like Bhagatram, but I am not such a person.

1106
01:40:37,596 --> 01:40:43,382
If my mother has to go, we
will go too.  We are not here.

1107
01:41:09,152 --> 01:41:10,346
Please come in.

1108
01:41:13,564 --> 01:41:15,844
Dad went out.

1109
01:41:16,111 --> 01:41:18,586
I came to meet you.

1110
01:41:19,179 --> 01:41:22,626
sit down

1111
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:28,546
Rajesh praises you a lot.

1112
01:41:28,868 --> 01:41:33,066
He mentions you in
every conversation.

1113
01:41:33,321 --> 01:41:37,721
- I don't know that.
- Why not, daughter?

1114
01:41:37,881 --> 01:41:40,041
You know everything.

1115
01:41:40,402 --> 01:41:45,561
Today I came to test your love.

1116
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:51,365
I am a very distressed woman.

1117
01:41:51,757 --> 01:41:55,241
Enemies killed my husband.

1118
01:41:55,562 --> 01:41:58,721
I became a widow
at a very young age.

1119
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,561
Only a little boy was with me.

1120
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:06,161
Only God knows how I was.

1121
01:42:07,411 --> 01:42:12,041
How I lived until now.

1122
01:42:13,141 --> 01:42:17,627
And when life is
about to get better...

1123
01:42:18,535 --> 01:42:20,721
...again questions arose.

1124
01:42:20,914 --> 01:42:25,321
Daughter, I came to
tell you this sad story.

1125
01:42:25,561 --> 01:42:28,979
I didn't understand what you were saying.

1126
01:42:29,315 --> 01:42:32,041
- Who killed your husband?
- Thakur!

1127
01:42:32,244 --> 01:42:34,677
- That's a lie.
- that is true.

1128
01:42:34,969 --> 01:42:38,241
- What do you want from me?
- Need your help.

1129
01:42:39,239 --> 01:42:41,174
You are not related
to these in any way.

1130
01:42:41,649 --> 01:42:47,681
However, I will tell you my secret
that I have not revealed to anyone.

1131
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:50,640
Thakur's wealth and property...

1132
01:42:50,968 --> 01:42:52,641
...I also owned a part.

1133
01:42:52,839 --> 01:42:55,961
My husband and Thakur
were business partners.

1134
01:42:56,741 --> 01:43:00,721
Thakur killed my husband
for greed of property.

1135
01:43:01,033 --> 01:43:02,841
Why didn't you arrest him?

1136
01:43:02,961 --> 01:43:07,921
I had no proof.

1137
01:43:08,041 --> 01:43:10,561
So I couldn't do anything.

1138
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:15,113
Meanwhile, a son was born in Thakur's house.

1139
01:43:16,881 --> 01:43:20,318
Thakur was hunting that night.

1140
01:43:20,438 --> 01:43:24,161
His wife slipped and fell unconscious.

1141
01:43:24,547 --> 01:43:26,641
So the baby was born
before the due date.

1142
01:43:26,801 --> 01:43:29,321
The midwife went to see the doctor.

1143
01:43:29,561 --> 01:43:33,321
My maid taking
advantage of the situation.

1144
01:43:33,561 --> 01:43:36,041
Helped me move the babies.

1145
01:43:36,161 --> 01:43:39,241
Here, lady.  Thakur's son.

1146
01:43:40,006 --> 01:43:44,981
Give your daughter and leave quickly.

1147
01:43:45,844 --> 01:43:47,237
Give it to me, ma'am.

1148
01:43:49,127 --> 01:43:50,891
Go quickly.

1149
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:57,184
Even if you do that...

1150
01:43:57,972 --> 01:44:04,224
...I brought up Thakur's
son with much love.

1151
01:44:04,344 --> 01:44:10,424
Just when I thought my problems were solved...

1152
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:11,984
...you entered his life.

1153
01:44:12,643 --> 01:44:15,664
- I am...?
- Yes.

1154
01:44:16,264 --> 01:44:17,844
your.

1155
01:44:18,184 --> 01:44:24,984
I thought I would give Thakur's
son back and get my daughter back.

1156
01:44:25,104 --> 01:44:26,744
There was only one solution.

1157
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,764
It was Rajesh and Meena getting married.

1158
01:44:30,404 --> 01:44:32,804
But now it is impossible.

1159
01:44:33,722 --> 01:44:35,484
Rajesh loves you.

1160
01:44:36,749 --> 01:44:41,404
Daughter, don't destroy
my life-long efforts.

1161
01:44:41,684 --> 01:44:43,684
I am begging you.

1162
01:44:44,004 --> 01:44:46,287
For God's sake, don't.

1163
01:44:53,423 --> 01:44:57,924
I will kill myself if Rajesh
and Meena don't get married.

1164
01:44:58,663 --> 01:45:00,644
And you are
responsible for my death.

1165
01:45:00,764 --> 01:45:05,247
For God's sake, shut up.

1166
01:45:06,598 --> 01:45:08,577
Then promise me.

1167
01:45:09,658 --> 01:45:12,644
You will never come
into Rajesh's life again.

1168
01:45:12,764 --> 01:45:15,804
You leave him forever.

1169
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:22,164
I promise.

1170
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:23,724
Please leave me like this now.

1171
01:45:23,844 --> 01:45:26,650
go now

1172
01:45:27,855 --> 01:45:29,410
daughter

1173
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,284
I am forever indebted to you.

1174
01:45:35,312 --> 01:45:38,004
You cheered up a grieving mother.

1175
01:45:38,684 --> 01:45:41,804
God will surely
help you for that.

1176
01:45:42,091 --> 01:45:43,929
Surely he will do so.

1177
01:46:00,868 --> 01:46:03,463
Taruna, where are you going?

1178
01:46:04,071 --> 01:46:06,463
- Near here.
- Come on, I'll drop you off.

1179
01:46:07,286 --> 01:46:08,551
Come on.

1180
01:46:11,283 --> 01:46:13,187
I will go with Bhagatram.

1181
01:46:13,775 --> 01:46:15,167
With Bhagatram...?

1182
01:46:15,616 --> 01:46:17,839
Yes, with Bhagatram.

1183
01:46:18,782 --> 01:46:20,789
Bhagatram, I looked for you.

1184
01:46:20,909 --> 01:46:21,949
- I am...?
- Yes.

1185
01:46:22,069 --> 01:46:23,269
- Really?
- Yes.

1186
01:46:23,389 --> 01:46:26,069
- Let's go where you say.
- I have a lot to talk about.

1187
01:46:26,298 --> 01:46:29,749
Let's go somewhere else.
People hear.

1188
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,506
OK, come on.

1189
01:46:31,626 --> 01:46:33,949
Brother right?

1190
01:46:34,069 --> 01:46:35,149
There you go!

1191
01:46:39,179 --> 01:46:40,589
did you see  He became jealous.

1192
01:46:41,459 --> 01:46:43,069
Now tell me, where to go?

1193
01:46:43,682 --> 01:46:46,229
I go to my house,
you go to yours.  got it?

1194
01:46:46,467 --> 01:46:51,149
Always changing.

1195
01:46:51,336 --> 01:46:54,069
What a strange girl.

1196
01:47:11,081 --> 01:47:14,909
Taruna, why is this?

1197
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:16,477
what is that?

1198
01:47:16,954 --> 01:47:18,989
You turned your back on me on the street...

1199
01:47:19,652 --> 01:47:21,669
...was happily chatting
with Bhagatram.

1200
01:47:22,153 --> 01:47:24,073
Did you hear the decision of the village court that day?

1201
01:47:24,126 --> 01:47:25,633
Do you accept that decision?

1202
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:29,233
- It is a decision of the village court.
- No, it was Mr. Thakur's decision.

1203
01:47:29,677 --> 01:47:31,433
If so, we must certainly accept it.

1204
01:47:31,553 --> 01:47:34,833
Mr. Thakur is a rich person.
The whole village listens to him.

1205
01:47:35,324 --> 01:47:36,764
Even we want to
live in this village.

1206
01:47:37,033 --> 01:47:40,313
- We cannot go against Mr. Thakur.
- Taruna.

1207
01:47:40,833 --> 01:47:44,073
Have you forgotten who Bhagatram is?

1208
01:47:44,153 --> 01:47:46,833
- He's a thug.
- Mr. Rajesh.

1209
01:47:46,993 --> 01:47:48,993
I don't want to hear
anything against him.

1210
01:47:49,473 --> 01:47:51,993
- Please get out of here.
- Taruna.

1211
01:47:52,393 --> 01:47:55,833
What happened to you?

1212
01:47:56,233 --> 01:47:59,753
Is the world changing so quickly?

1213
01:48:00,181 --> 01:48:03,713
Bhagatram, the one who
tried to disrespect you.

1214
01:48:03,833 --> 01:48:07,313
- Discredited you.
- I told you to go, didn't I?

1215
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:09,833
I will go.

1216
01:48:10,723 --> 01:48:12,833
But tell me.

1217
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:18,073
What happened to the
promises you made to me?

1218
01:48:18,732 --> 01:48:22,113
Those promises are just a joke.

1219
01:48:22,233 --> 01:48:24,073
We always joked with each other.

1220
01:48:24,318 --> 01:48:28,633
First we did, then
you and then we will.

1221
01:48:29,309 --> 01:48:33,553
I didn't know you
would take it seriously.

1222
01:48:34,065 --> 01:48:37,393
The whole village knows
that Bhagatram is my lover.

1223
01:48:37,776 --> 01:48:40,153
We got engaged when we were young.

1224
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:43,153
There is nothing Mr. Thakur and
the village court can do about it.

1225
01:48:43,665 --> 01:48:46,175
That is the truth.

1226
01:48:46,295 --> 01:48:48,308
Please don't take
this any further.

1227
01:48:48,553 --> 01:48:51,153
Don't ask anything else about it.

1228
01:48:51,313 --> 01:48:53,953
And never come here again.

1229
01:55:08,347 --> 01:55:09,427
Meena.

1230
01:55:13,878 --> 01:55:19,317
We played with love
for your entertainment.

1231
01:55:20,437 --> 01:55:21,921
It's over now.

1232
01:55:26,437 --> 01:55:30,117
This necklace is the symbol of my victory.

1233
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:33,357
But I don't deserve it.

1234
01:55:35,168 --> 01:55:36,563
You deserve it.

1235
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,160
Keep it safe.

1236
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:43,240
I will always remember that...

1237
01:55:43,471 --> 01:55:45,920
...that he won even if he lost.

1238
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:48,840
And even if I win, I lose.

1239
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:02,910
Mr. Rajesh!

1240
01:57:03,838 --> 01:57:08,910
Mr. Rajesh!

1241
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:14,110
Mr. Rajesh.

1242
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:16,508
She left this note and disappeared.

1243
01:57:17,208 --> 01:57:19,488
"Father I'm sorry"

1244
01:57:19,968 --> 01:57:22,208
"I'm Going Forever"

1245
01:57:22,486 --> 01:57:25,791
"Tell Mr. Rajesh that
I didn't cheat him."

1246
01:57:27,047 --> 01:57:28,429
Come on.

1247
01:57:28,873 --> 01:57:30,321
may be...

1248
01:57:30,441 --> 01:57:32,481
According to this article, she
may have committed suicide.

1249
01:57:32,548 --> 01:57:35,628
No, Inspector.  do not say that.

1250
01:57:35,814 --> 01:57:38,007
My daughter cannot kill herself.

1251
01:57:38,127 --> 01:57:41,268
She cannot leave her old father alone.

1252
01:57:41,478 --> 01:57:43,468
do not be sad.
We'll keep looking.

1253
01:57:43,987 --> 01:57:47,548
If we get any information, we
will let you know.  Now you go.

1254
01:57:52,852 --> 01:57:54,052
Meena.

1255
01:58:01,057 --> 01:58:04,068
Why are you silent?

1256
01:58:04,387 --> 01:58:06,788
Who gave you this necklace?

1257
01:58:07,435 --> 01:58:09,500
Taruna, gave me this necklace.

1258
01:58:09,908 --> 01:58:11,489
How do you feel about it?

1259
01:58:17,091 --> 01:58:18,916
It's not worth it to her.

1260
01:58:19,857 --> 01:58:22,322
You don't deserve it.
Remove it.

1261
01:58:22,408 --> 01:58:24,528
Rajesh, what's wrong with you?

1262
01:58:24,548 --> 01:58:26,108
what are you saying?

1263
01:58:26,228 --> 01:58:27,948
We are going to get
married in a few days.

1264
01:58:28,068 --> 01:58:32,908
I will not marry a girl
who lost her friend's love.

1265
01:58:33,308 --> 01:58:37,068
Taruna, our friendship broke
the day my love was taken away.

1266
01:58:37,228 --> 01:58:40,072
- Your love?
- Yes, my love.

1267
01:58:40,308 --> 01:58:43,708
I had told Taruna not
to come between us.

1268
01:58:44,228 --> 01:58:45,348
But she didn't listen.

1269
01:58:45,468 --> 01:58:48,788
If I were alive today, I
would not forgive her.

1270
01:58:49,068 --> 01:58:52,308
- Do you talk about forgiveness after sinning?
- Rajesh.

1271
01:58:52,504 --> 01:58:55,468
If anyone but you said this...

1272
01:58:55,528 --> 01:58:58,145
And if there was someone
else in your place...

1273
01:58:58,169 --> 01:59:02,514
-...she would rather die than be decent.
- Politeness?

1274
01:59:02,708 --> 01:59:06,668
Yes, something Tarana
had and you don't.

1275
01:59:06,788 --> 01:59:09,668
Rajesh!  You have
no right to insult me.

1276
01:59:09,788 --> 01:59:13,068
One is defamed by
actions and intentions.

1277
01:59:13,228 --> 01:59:17,594
It is very easy for someone to be like
you, but very difficult to be like Taruna.

1278
01:59:27,593 --> 01:59:28,803
No.

1279
01:59:28,923 --> 01:59:30,426
why not?

1280
01:59:30,748 --> 01:59:32,188
Why wasn't I allowed to die?

1281
01:59:32,348 --> 01:59:34,708
Because you didn't let me live.

1282
01:59:34,828 --> 01:59:36,228
Don't be so stubborn.

1283
01:59:36,348 --> 01:59:39,668
In a little while, the priest will go and
come with the pastor, and we will get married.

1284
01:59:39,908 --> 01:59:43,628
Then neither you nor father nor
society can take you away from me.

1285
01:59:43,748 --> 01:59:46,148
Because you are
legally my wife.  got it?

1286
01:59:46,268 --> 01:59:47,572
Gauri!

1287
01:59:49,367 --> 01:59:51,308
- Okay!
- Sit down.

1288
01:59:51,428 --> 01:59:55,428
- You don't talk.
- Brother!

1289
01:59:55,875 --> 01:59:58,068
Gauri!

1290
01:59:59,268 --> 02:00:07,268
Bhagatram's sister,
be my bride.  I am...

1291
02:00:07,994 --> 02:00:10,268
what did you say

1292
02:00:10,653 --> 02:00:12,988
- Nothing.
- Why did you come here?

1293
02:00:13,428 --> 02:00:17,335
- I came back.
- Then go.

1294
02:00:17,748 --> 02:00:18,970
I leave.

1295
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:21,268
OK!

1296
02:00:23,988 --> 02:00:25,708
Did someone call me?

1297
02:00:25,828 --> 02:00:27,702
No.  go out

1298
02:00:29,508 --> 02:00:30,956
OK!

1299
02:00:31,188 --> 02:00:34,577
- Someone called me.
- That's your illusion.

1300
02:00:34,697 --> 02:00:37,308
- I don't have such a bug.
- Go, get out.

1301
02:00:37,428 --> 02:00:39,874
- Okay!
- Okay!

1302
02:00:40,482 --> 02:00:41,588
I hear two voices.

1303
02:00:41,928 --> 02:00:43,908
One is Gauri, the other
is younger sister Taruna.

1304
02:00:44,068 --> 02:00:46,228
- Sister, are you alive?
- Yes.

1305
02:00:46,348 --> 02:00:49,188
- But now you are being killed.
- Why kill me?

1306
02:00:49,428 --> 02:00:52,837
Hariya somehow
rescue Taruna from here.

1307
02:00:53,188 --> 02:00:56,708
- I will call Rajesh.
- Who will let you go?

1308
02:00:56,828 --> 02:01:00,988
- Leave me or I will beat you.
- Hit me?

1309
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:03,702
you idiot.

1310
02:01:17,184 --> 02:01:19,544
"Here we go round
the mulberry bush"

1311
02:01:19,664 --> 02:01:22,870
"Here we go round
the mulberry bush"

1312
02:01:23,433 --> 02:01:25,772
"Here we go round
the mulberry bush"

1313
02:01:25,892 --> 02:01:28,255
"Here we go round
the mulberry bush"

1314
02:01:28,882 --> 02:01:31,055
"Here we go in a circle"

1315
02:01:31,348 --> 02:01:32,644
you idiot.

1316
02:01:38,908 --> 02:01:41,668
Your carpet is very dusty.

1317
02:01:42,061 --> 02:01:43,282
Dusty?

1318
02:01:51,988 --> 02:01:55,068
- What did this do?
- Wait.

1319
02:02:02,009 --> 02:02:04,588
The Villain Downstairs
and the Villain Upstairs.

1320
02:02:04,708 --> 02:02:07,750
The other villain is white, this one is black.

1321
02:02:09,668 --> 02:02:12,268
what are you doing

1322
02:02:24,348 --> 02:02:30,131
- Take this scorpion.
- A scorpion.

1323
02:02:35,187 --> 02:02:37,720
- My God.
- Help me.

1324
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,598
Oh, my God.

1325
02:02:52,797 --> 02:02:55,828
- God, a scorpion!
- Where is the priest?

1326
02:02:55,988 --> 02:02:57,327
Didn't meet the priest, sir.

1327
02:02:59,188 --> 02:03:00,828
Mr. Rajesh.

1328
02:03:00,988 --> 02:03:02,948
- The sister is alive.
- what?

1329
02:03:03,068 --> 02:03:06,468
Yes.  Bhagatram keeps
her locked in his house.

1330
02:03:06,588 --> 02:03:11,668
- Bhagatram.
- You go there.  I will inform Mr. Thakur.

1331
02:05:33,588 --> 02:05:34,668
Meena.

1332
02:05:37,782 --> 02:05:39,361
Rajesh.

1333
02:05:40,588 --> 02:05:44,928
- I want to tell you something.
- Meena.

1334
02:05:50,146 --> 02:05:52,786
No matter, Rajesh survived.

1335
02:05:53,226 --> 02:05:56,786
Is there any use for such a
large body?  Go kill yourself.

1336
02:05:57,058 --> 02:05:59,906
- You can't fight fate, sir.
- Stop this nonsense.

1337
02:06:00,026 --> 02:06:02,518
- Don't get angry.
- Why hasn't the priest come yet?

1338
02:06:02,706 --> 02:06:03,970
He will come soon.

1339
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:11,316
Why don't you say
anything honey?  Meena.

1340
02:06:11,503 --> 02:06:12,583
What happened to Meena?

1341
02:06:12,823 --> 02:06:16,727
Meena, my child.

1342
02:06:20,254 --> 02:06:21,503
Who killed her?

1343
02:06:21,737 --> 02:06:26,151
You killed my daughter.
You are a murderer.

1344
02:06:26,271 --> 02:06:27,967
I will kill you.

1345
02:06:28,087 --> 02:06:30,537
I will not spare you, wretch.

1346
02:06:30,828 --> 02:06:32,583
Do not touch me.

1347
02:06:33,499 --> 02:06:36,503
You killed Meena.

1348
02:06:36,991 --> 02:06:39,232
Meena's father, ie
Shanti's husband.

1349
02:06:39,352 --> 02:06:41,832
- what are you saying?
- It is true.

1350
02:06:41,952 --> 02:06:45,395
Mrs. Meena and Shanti know it.

1351
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:47,512
what is true

1352
02:06:47,672 --> 02:06:49,872
You make excuses to run away.

1353
02:06:50,376 --> 02:06:52,952
After knowing the truth you
will run away, Mr. Thakur.

1354
02:06:53,272 --> 02:06:57,352
- From you and your son.
- Son?

1355
02:06:57,736 --> 02:06:58,752
Yes.

1356
02:06:58,872 --> 02:07:01,380
When you kill Mrs.
Shanti's husband.

1357
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,139
That's a lie.

1358
02:07:02,259 --> 02:07:03,672
that is true.

1359
02:07:04,672 --> 02:07:08,503
Mr. Thakur, if you had the
guts to commit that crime…

1360
02:07:09,548 --> 02:07:12,849
-...be brave enough to hear this truth.
- I did not commit any sin.

1361
02:07:12,969 --> 02:07:16,432
You are a sinner and a murderer.

1362
02:07:17,982 --> 02:07:21,748
When you kill Mrs.
Shanti's husband.

1363
02:07:21,868 --> 02:07:26,722
She transferred
her daughter Meena.

1364
02:07:27,503 --> 02:07:29,512
To take that revenge from your son.

1365
02:07:29,766 --> 02:07:33,352
- It's impossible.
- But it happened.

1366
02:07:33,512 --> 02:07:38,432
Children are switched at birth.

1367
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:41,672
- Evidence...?
- Mrs. Shanti.

1368
02:07:41,942 --> 02:07:43,672
- Shanti?
- Yes.

1369
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:48,952
That means Meena
Shanti's daughter.

1370
02:07:49,637 --> 02:07:53,432
Are you my son?

1371
02:07:54,327 --> 02:07:58,752
- Rajesh.  Is it true son?
- I wish it wasn't so.

1372
02:07:59,239 --> 02:08:00,272
son

1373
02:08:00,899 --> 02:08:04,712
Not your son, I'm a murderer.

1374
02:08:04,832 --> 02:08:08,872
Mr. Thakur, take
me to the police.

1375
02:08:09,035 --> 02:08:12,872
Don't be silly, my son.
You cannot commit murder.

1376
02:08:13,272 --> 02:08:15,752
If you've done it by
mistake, don't tell anyone.

1377
02:08:15,952 --> 02:08:17,872
I blame it on someone else.

1378
02:08:18,112 --> 02:08:20,743
As long as this father is there,
nothing can happen to the son.

1379
02:08:20,863 --> 02:08:22,756
whose father

1380
02:08:22,876 --> 02:08:24,032
what father

1381
02:08:24,794 --> 02:08:26,672
Mr. Thakur.

1382
02:08:27,032 --> 02:08:30,752
Look at her.

1383
02:08:31,127 --> 02:08:35,352
You raised her.

1384
02:08:35,942 --> 02:08:39,712
A while ago you
screamed and cried.

1385
02:08:39,792 --> 02:08:42,952
Because until then she is your daughter.

1386
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:46,712
But the sadness disappeared in a moment.

1387
02:08:46,832 --> 02:08:49,272
You don't regret her
death one bit now.

1388
02:08:49,808 --> 02:08:52,592
Because now she is not
yours but Shanti's daughter.

1389
02:08:53,232 --> 02:08:56,752
Forget what happened son.

1390
02:08:56,872 --> 02:08:58,912
Do you want me to forget your crimes?

1391
02:08:59,032 --> 02:09:00,832
Did I grow up in
someone else's home?

1392
02:09:00,952 --> 02:09:02,992
Should I forget that my
father was a murderer?

1393
02:09:03,112 --> 02:09:04,943
For your wealth,
should I forget it?

1394
02:09:05,063 --> 02:09:08,752
Then Mrs. Shanti took away
my happiness for hers, didn't she?

1395
02:09:09,049 --> 02:09:10,952
Taruna, you are the one who separated me.

1396
02:09:11,591 --> 02:09:14,074
Mr. Thakur, you are the one
who committed all these crimes.

1397
02:09:14,154 --> 02:09:16,032
This innocent girl
was punished for that.

1398
02:09:16,577 --> 02:09:18,116
You did everything for him.

1399
02:09:18,236 --> 02:09:21,759
But she gave her
life and mocked you.

1400
02:09:21,879 --> 02:09:25,952
Tell me the truth, who killed her?

1401
02:09:26,614 --> 02:09:28,672
Bhagatram and his associates.

1402
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:29,970
Bhagatram!

1403
02:10:10,456 --> 02:10:12,172
- I will set you free.
- No.

1404
02:10:12,192 --> 02:10:14,432
- Why is that?
- I'll stay here.  You run away.

1405
02:10:14,734 --> 02:10:17,432
- Why is that?
- They always peek in.

1406
02:10:17,752 --> 02:10:19,672
If they don't see me here.

1407
02:10:19,826 --> 02:10:22,192
Come and see.  Then we
can be caught on the way.

1408
02:10:22,432 --> 02:10:24,213
So be careful sister.

1409
02:10:24,352 --> 02:10:26,351
My brother is a very bad man.

1410
02:10:26,672 --> 02:10:29,272
I will inform brother Rajesh.

1411
02:10:40,327 --> 02:10:41,512
I leave.

1412
02:10:59,555 --> 02:11:00,672
Thakur.

1413
02:11:03,272 --> 02:11:08,752
You killed my husband and daughter.

1414
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:10,512
Now I'm the only one left.

1415
02:11:11,069 --> 02:11:14,832
Strangle me too.

1416
02:11:14,952 --> 02:11:16,618
- Mother.
- Strangle me too.

1417
02:11:22,352 --> 02:11:26,032
No... no.

1418
02:11:26,671 --> 02:11:32,095
I am not a mother.  I am not a mother.

1419
02:11:32,952 --> 02:11:39,201
I separated from my daughter.

1420
02:11:40,352 --> 02:11:44,674
I took you away from your mother.

1421
02:11:45,919 --> 02:11:53,552
I changed your life for Meena.

1422
02:11:53,672 --> 02:11:57,672
Instead of God, I
tried to do justice.

1423
02:11:58,032 --> 02:12:02,032
Oh my God, take away my Meena.

1424
02:12:02,592 --> 02:12:04,633
Brother Rajesh.

1425
02:12:04,753 --> 02:12:07,195
- Taruna, save.
- Where is she?

1426
02:12:07,315 --> 02:12:09,395
At the Round House
three miles from here.

1427
02:12:09,715 --> 02:12:10,795
Come on.

1428
02:12:14,530 --> 02:12:18,377
I will take you before
that.  Come on.

1429
02:12:19,058 --> 02:12:20,602
- Leave her alone.
- No.

1430
02:12:20,831 --> 02:12:21,831
Leave her alone.

1431
02:12:24,591 --> 02:12:25,591
Priest.

1432
02:13:43,992 --> 02:13:45,735
- Sir.
- keep away.

1433
02:14:34,587 --> 02:14:38,220
right now

1434
02:15:05,167 --> 02:15:06,548
Yes, that's me.

1435
02:15:07,348 --> 02:15:12,788
One criminal killed another
criminal and saved an innocent.

1436
02:15:17,231 --> 02:15:19,202
Inspector, it is good that you have come.

1437
02:15:19,322 --> 02:15:20,322
Mr. Thakur, you?

1438
02:15:20,486 --> 02:15:22,745
Yes, I did the killing.

1439
02:15:23,349 --> 02:15:25,351
arrest me

1440
02:15:29,516 --> 02:15:34,348
Rajesh I am not worthy
enough to apologize to you.

1441
02:15:35,163 --> 02:15:36,777
I am a murderer.

1442
02:15:37,468 --> 02:15:41,823
But I am also a father.

1443
02:15:42,281 --> 02:15:44,708
right?

1444
02:15:45,468 --> 02:15:47,268
- Rajesh!
- father!

1445
02:15:47,773 --> 02:15:50,948
- Rajesh!
- father!

1446
02:15:54,053 --> 02:15:55,503
- Rajesh!
- father!

1447
02:16:01,646 --> 02:16:03,189
Come, Mr. Thakur.

1448
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:06,868
May you be blessed.

1449
02:16:19,189 --> 02:16:21,630
where are you going

1450
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:23,944
I do not know.

1451
02:16:25,544 --> 02:16:27,424
What am I doing here?

1452
02:16:27,704 --> 02:16:29,457
No mom.  do not say that.

1453
02:16:30,497 --> 02:16:31,624
Here, mother.

1454
02:16:32,189 --> 02:16:35,319
Mr. Thakur has
signed the documents.

1455
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,684
To you, your property has been returned.

1456
02:16:39,778 --> 02:16:44,062
This property is not mine, it's yours.

1457
02:16:45,024 --> 02:16:46,105
Who will take care of me now?

1458
02:16:48,624 --> 02:16:53,543
I missed receiving
my child's love.

1459
02:16:53,954 --> 02:16:55,975
Mom, don't say that.

1460
02:16:57,586 --> 02:17:02,784
Meena is no more.
But there is your son.

1461
02:17:07,189 --> 02:17:09,144
Rajesh!

1462
02:17:09,264 --> 02:17:14,424
Mom, promise
you'll never leave us.

1463
02:17:16,630 --> 02:17:18,680
Promise us.

1464
02:17:22,632 --> 02:17:23,758
Mother!

1465
02:17:24,561 --> 02:17:27,504
If you are free...

1466
02:17:27,624 --> 02:17:30,704
...we need help too.

1467
02:17:31,212 --> 02:17:34,304
But it's okay if you can't.

1468
02:17:34,542 --> 02:17:38,104
Let's bless each other!

1469
02:17:38,554 --> 02:17:41,089
"Heartless Lovers"

1470
02:17:41,209 --> 02:17:42,635
"I'm thinking about you"

1471
02:17:42,836 --> 02:17:46,537
"Why did I do that?"
