Oh.

20
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,619
Sreeyetta,

Sreeyettan is taking bath.

I'll ask him to call you back.

25
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,794
It's okay, ma'am.
I'll call after some time.

26
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,715
Who is it?

27
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,434
Gautham?
- Yes.

28
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,596
Must be some insurance agent.
- Thank you.

29
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:56,909
Welcome.

30
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,594
Sreeyetta, did you eat?
- I already ate.

31
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:07,967
Bad girl!

32
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,909
Don't you knowthat you
shouldn't say such words?

33
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,457
I wasn't serious..

34
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,409
lam okay, dad.

35
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,616
You are the limit.

36
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,743
Gosh! What happened to you?

37
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,687
No.
Nothing, Sreeyetta.

38
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,341
ljust got a little tensed.

39
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,784
I am okay, Sreeyetta.

40
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:46,921
Are you sure?
- Yes.

41
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,958
I'm okay, Sreeyetta.
You carry on.

42
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,898
Dad is leaving, okay?

43
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,877
And don't forget to call Daisy
Chechi if you need anything.

44
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,231
Where's the car key?

45
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,738
It's on that table.
- Okay.

46
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,190
Sreeyetta, just a minute.

47
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,958
You have to buy some stuff.

48
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,049
Today?

49
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,579
Is she eating paint or what?
I bought it just last week, right?

50
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,381
She's your daughter.
She donates it to all her friends.

51
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,193
Good morning Babuetta..

52
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,147
Sir, shall I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

53
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,389
Forthe past 2 months, you
come here almost every day.

54
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,674
You come here, read and write;

55
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,156
you buy many cups of tea;

56
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,748
and you thinka lot.

57
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,041
Tell me the truth.

58
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,672
You're writing a story
for a movie, right?

59
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,567
So you understood?

60
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,251
What's the story?

61
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,707
We

.. - Say it in short. Rest
I'll watch in the theatre.

62
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,313
Oh.

63
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,170
The story..

64
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,491
Our hero who returnsto his homeland
after 10-15years in London,

65
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,971
makes a lot of foolish mistakes.

66
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,216
He helped his family and
friends more than necessary.

67
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,034
lnvested in shares;

68
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,616
And so, he loses all the
money he had with him.

69
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,687
And has a few debts
here and there.

70
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,770
An NRI c
ich\/©.

71
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,915
It's not that..

72
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,688
His wife doesn't know all this.

73
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,392
He says that he's going to the office every
morning; but he doesn't have any job.

74
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,380
Then why doesn't he go back?
- He can't go backjust like that.

75
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,084
The hero was working
in a hotel there.

76
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,796
So he came here with a desire
to start a hotel like that.

77
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,610
The money he had saved for
that, was what got spent.

78
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,522
Still, he hasn't given up hopes.

79
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,639
He's running around to
find investors for it.

80
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,971
It's the story of a naive hero who
tries to solve these problems

81
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,622
without letting his
family know about it.

82
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,933

 feel like I've heard it somewhere.

83
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,166
But ifthere's an unexpected twist,
it will work out.

84
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:06,659
Is it?
- Yes.

85
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,028
Atwistwill come soon.

86
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,770
Then you carry on
with your work, sir.

87
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,803
We

..

88
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,038
Sir..

89
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,096
lfthere's any role suitable
for me, please consider me.

90
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,489
Atea shop guy might
have a role in this.

91
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,710
Babuchetta, who is it?

92
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,361
He is a director, writer; and a
friend of mine. - lntroduce us, please.

93
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,364
I can't do that now.
Sir is busy.

94
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,065
One tea.

95
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,889
Sir, the balance..
- Keep it.

96
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,928
Come on!

97
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,382
Hello?

98
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,143
Anyway, a client of mine is waiting.

99
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,026
(kisses)

100
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,095
Hello sir.

101
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,163
I am Gautham.

102
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,969
I had called in the morning.
Your wife picked up the phone.

103
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,598
Understood.
My wife told me.

104
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,172
What's the matter?

105
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,196
I'm the operations
manager of Lalaji Corp.

106
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,260
What is it, Pritam?

107
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,342
Not Pritam, sir.
Gautham.

108
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,321
We had called from the office many
times yesterday & day before.

109
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,012
You didn't pick up.

110
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,001
That's why I came in person.

111
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,703
You had called?
- Yes.

112
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,685
I didn't see the calls.

113
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,118
That happens.

114
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,403
You wouldn't have seen
the messages too right?

115
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,009
I didn't notice.

116
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,449
Then shall we go, sir?
- Where?

117
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,422
My boss wanted to meet you.

118
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,758
Well, lam on my way
for an urgent meeting.

119
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,741
Shall I come to your
office in the evening?

120
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,431
Oh! You have a meeting?
- Ya.

121
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,386
What do we do now?

122
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,831
Both can't happen together, right?
- Yes.

123
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,716
Then postpone the meeting, sir.
- But..

124
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,960
Get in, sir.
l'll drive.

125
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,046
They are waiting there, right?

126
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,719
Okay then.
Thank you.

127
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,807
Deepu..
- Yes.

128
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,115
Has Suresh grown fatter?

129
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,381
When he came to take money
from us, he was like this!

130
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,734
Are you yourself eating all
the food from your hotel?

131
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,768
Nothing like that, uncle.

132
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,695
Then, return the money to Deepu
auspiciously and get going.

133
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,860
But uncle, the money is not ready.

134
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,105
It won't be.

135
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,135
That's why I called you here.

136
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,006
Let's go to that room
inside and talk. Come.

137
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,780
It's not a small amount, Suresh.

138
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,161
Well uncle, certain things came
up and lam a little tight now.

139
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,516
lam a little tight now.

140
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:23,856
Tight?
- Yes.

141
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,286
My situation..

142
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:31,423
I'll make it loose for you, you bald-head!
- Uncle, no!

143
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,526
Give me a week more.

144
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,806
I gave you money despite knowing
that you're a big fraud;

145
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,727
because of the old bond
I had with your father.

146
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,367
You took money saying that
you'll repay within 2 months.

147
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,096
How many months has it been now?
- Five. - Seven!

148
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,139
- Must be.
- Must be?

149
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,166
Must be?
- Good morning sir.

150
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,449
Good morning Maya.

151
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,378
You seem to be really happy.
What's it?

152
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,006
My son got selected to the
district team, sir. -Awesome.

153
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,780
Faisal is the coach, right?
- Yes sir.

154
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,172
Deepu, buy a full kit for him,
sponsored by the company. - Okay Papa.

155
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,348
We mustturn him into a Virat Kohli.
-Yes Papa.

156
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,013
Then carry on, Maya.
- Okay sir.

157
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,470
You..

158
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,240
You..

159
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,450
Fouﬂ

160
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,844
If you don't return the rest of the
money within four days, Suresh..

161
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,389
I'll bring it. Definitely.
You know me, right?

162
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,853
Should I open the
doorfor you now?

163
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,275
No. You please sit.
I'll go.

164
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,173
Sir, come.

165
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,014
Oh God!

166
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,496
Lord Guruvayoorappa!

167
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,501
Come, sir.
Don't waste time.

168
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,956
Thank you.
- He has to go next week. - Maya!

169
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,823
Lalaji Uncle is really
happy about your son.

170
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,523
Are the sweets over?
- No. It's there.

171
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,208
What is it, Chechi?
What's special?

172
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:27,980
Uncle is inside.

173
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,830
Gautham, I need to meet you.
Call me.

174
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,084
Ya. I'll call you.

175
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,150
Papa, this is Sreeram.

176
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,230
Sreeram sir!

177
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,372
Sit down, please.

178
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,087
He's smart.

179
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,172
So Sreeram sir,

180
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,894
This is the 2nd time you've
defaulted the payment, sir.

181
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,280
Well Lalaji, I didn't receive the
funds which were supposed to come.

182
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,857
But not being available when
we call you, is not so good.

183
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,372
Even if we call that driver
Venu who introduced you to us,

184
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,419
Where is he?
Venu?

185
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,326
Venu is on a trip.

186
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,490
Not to Malayattoor, right?

187
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,331
Leave that.

188
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,196
What would you like to have?
Tea or coffee.

189
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,244
Tea.
- Okay.

190
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,403
Deepu..

191
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,651
Black tea is fine.

192
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,665
I am his son.
- That's okay.

193
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,329
Sir, it's me.

194
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,708
What is this, sir?

195
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,759
Tell me sir.

196
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,828
When can you return the money?

197
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,404
Lalaji..

198
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,415
lfyou give me one more month, l'll
settle the full amount with interest.

199
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,114
One month?

200
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,398
Do you watch cricket?

201
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,577
We

..

202
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,429
Just say it.
It's okay even if you go wrong.

203
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,204
Next ball.. will be a sixer, right?

204
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,708
Yes. Sixer.

205
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,219
This is called optimism.

206
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,746
You asked for one month, right?
Okay!

207
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,016
Thank you Lalaji.
Thank you so much.

208
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,478
Yes Lalaji.
Yaay!

209
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,417
Lalaji, I'm leaving.
I have a trip.

210
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,907
Ya. Go ahead.

211
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:49,828
Key?
Key?

212
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,531
Lalaji, catch!

213
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,353
Then shall I also?

214
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,690
Gautham!

215
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,797
Did you have breakfast?

216
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,208
No sir. I thought I'll have
it after this meeting.

217
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,330
Son, why are you working so hard
without even eating on time?

218
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,169
Okay.
-And ya,

219
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:11,884
there's a match tomorrow.

220
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,495
I remember, sir.

221
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,239
These days, whenever I call,
your phone is always engaged.

222
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,307
It's a client, sir.

223
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,449
Ya. Carry on!

224
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,877
What are you thinking, Sreeram sir?

225
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,286
Come.
l'lltell you something.

226
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,680
Jaison, my dear;
are you sleeping?

227
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,699
You know what, Sreeram sir;

228
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,489
even if the interest isn't paid
on time, I'll still give time.

229
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,692
But if someone cheats me
and hides from me;

230
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,047

 asked my boys not to hit you on
your face forjust one reason;

231
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,457
You aren't even married yet.

232
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,187
If your face is punctured,
that will be very difficult.

233
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,653
But thinking that I'll hit you
only on your chest & tummy;

234
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,360
don't make this a routine, okay?

235
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,010
Sir, I need to leave urgently.

236
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,692
But why don't you leave after you
both get introduced to each other?

237
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,323
Deepu!

238
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,591
Sorry Papa.

239
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,623
My dear Sreeram sir, you shouldn't
get introduced to him likethis.

240
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,464
Then?

241
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,817
Nothing.
It's simple.

242
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,762
Hit him anywhere
except his face.

243
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,311
Gosh.
Me?

244
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,170
I haven't hit anyone so far.
- Is it?

245
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:56,856
So it's your debut!

246
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,365
Jaison, you're really lucky.

247
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,814
Well, what's the point
of me hitting him?

248
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,546
I don't expect him to become
good because you hit him.

249
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,510
Then why should I hit
him unnecessarily?

250
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,320
But 
..
- Hit him!

251
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,350
Oh my God!

252
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,762
What a punch, sir.

253
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:17,919
Was it too much?

254
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,619
So Jaison,
don't forget!

255
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,449
The same day next month, okay?

256
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,629
Only if you know the
pleasure of hitting someone;

257
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,690
you'll be able to enjoy the pain of
getting it back, one day. Understood?

258
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,207
Kids these days are really forgetful.

259
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,747
You don't have any such problems, right?
- No.

260
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,946
So when is our date?
- March 8th.

261
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:50,900
Supen

262
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:53,699
you may go!

263
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,478
Hello.
I'm reaching.

264
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,566
Just 10 minutes.

265
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,492
If you mortgage your house, won't
you get a loan from the bank?

266
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,296
And you can give that
to Lalaji, right?

267
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,478
lcan..
But..

268
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,576
The house is in
Preethi's name, right?

269
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,496
If you sell this car, you can pay the
interest & some of the full amount, right?

270
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:47,619
But..

271
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,783
it would also be in her name, right?
- Yes.

272
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,351
I don't have a bike, Venu.

273
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,626
If you had one, you could've
made it also in her name, right?

274
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,064
Nothing!

275
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,005
Sir, I'm stuck in traffic.
Almost there.

276
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:04,836
l'll reach now.

277
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,310
Lalaji has given
us one month time.

278
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,442
Don't expect another day
beyond that from him.

279
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,308
l'll arrange it, Venu.
- You should, sir.

280
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,959
Or else, they will take my car.
- No!

281
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,714
Sir, he had already decided how
much time he has to give you.

282
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,853
And that was just a trick.
That's all.

283
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,909
To ask you to predict the next ball of
a 2 day old match from its highlights,

284
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,189
Lalaji is not such a schmuck.

285
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,030
Is that so?

286
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,093
I also thought why he was..

287
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,731
Sir, don't keep thinking.

288
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,018
When I went to borrow
money for you,

289
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,203
they had fixed some
GPS gadget on my car.

290
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,205
What are you looking?
They've fixed it inside.

291
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,446
If we don't pay, they will take
my car whenever they feel like.

292
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,121
And I'll get beaten up as well.

293
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,620
Sorry.

294
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,026
Sir, my car..

295
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,176
Who am I saying all this to!

296
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,202
Sreeyetta..

297
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,969
Are you tensed about anything?

298
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,045
How come you asked?

299
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,882
No.
Nothing. I must be mistaken.

300
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,091
No. Nothing.

301
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,254
Let me try.

302
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,004
I need it within 2
weeks at least.

303
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,580
The situation is really dull.
You know right?

304
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,697
Call me after a week.

305
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,619
It's about money, right?

306
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,788
I'm not promising you..

307
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,799
Let me see if I can
get something ready.

308
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,640
Okay?

309
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,985
Well, did you drop that London
model restaurant's plans?

310
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,521
Have to figure out something.

311
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,942
We'll discuss, man.
A new team has landed.

312
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:35,968
Come to the club sometime.

313
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,255
Okay.

314
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,148
Drink it.

315
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,691
How long do we meet up
likethis in hotel rooms?

316
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,012
Hey! No need of any tension here.

317
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,149
No one will know.

318
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,722
They might not know today.
That's not what! meant.

319
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,310
We'll figure out a way forthat.

320
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,796
l have decided what to do.

321
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,294
You just have to be with me.

322
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,831
Bro.. You?

323
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,913
How come you're here?

324
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,017
Wherever you go for a feast, I'll know..

325
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,777
This is not such a case.

326
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,783
Is it Leena?
- Yes.

327
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,124
Dude, Stephen..
Don'tjust..

328
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,344
You knowthatl love her, right?

329
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,029
lfl say this to you, I
know that you'll mock me.

330
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,599
That's why I didn't say this.

331
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:00,839
What about her husband?

332
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,131
If he knows this, you'll
be in deep trouble.

333
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,425
Bro, I would need your
help in this matter.

334
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,406
In this case?

335
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,247
Ya rig ht!

336
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,580
So whatjob does
lkka have here now?

337
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,113
Nothing.

338
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,853
ljust came to see you
in this condition.

339
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,056
Dude!

340
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,533
Here. Rajesh asked me to
hand this overto you.

341
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,786
He can call me, right?
- Check your mobile.

342
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,652
It's on silent mode.

343
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,627
You get going!

344
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,067
Go!

345
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,374
Bro!

346
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,047
What's in it?

347
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,210
In this?

348
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,048
Hey!

349
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,780
I'll throw this &
break your head!

350
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,096
Sir, this will be trouble.

351
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,878
They are kids, Venu..

352
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,433
I'm not talking about
the kids, sir.

353
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,774
He gave me an angry look &
hit hard on my car'stank!

354
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,019
Who?

355
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,768
That guy who took
you there that day.

356
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:23,988
Oh! Adam?

357
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,748
Not Adam..

358
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,358
Sir, Gautham!

359
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,472
And then?
- Then what?

360
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,457
I lost my peace of
mind because of him.

361
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,914
I called you when I felt I
was dying with tension.

362
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,155
Sir, only ten days are left.

363
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,190
They will take my car.

364
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:40,976
Calm down, Venu.

365
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,459
l'll figure out a way.

366
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,034
Sir, the problem will be solved
if you say this to yourwife.

367
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,450
She will understand.

368
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,707
It's not like I don't
know it, Venu.

369
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,251
The doctor has asked not to make
her strain at all. That's why!

370
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,040
I'll tell her everything
once the delivery is over.

371
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,697
Is there any way to
pre pone the delivery?

372
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,270
Why?

373
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,453
I've given a request.

374
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,781
Sir, how'sthe
story progressing?

375
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,792
I'm not able to find
a twist, Babuetta.

376
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,348
Make it fast, sir.
- I'll try.

377
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,118
Sir, your neighbour
lady is calling.

378
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,348
Daisy Sreeram.

379
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,113
Her husband's name is Alex.

380
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,769
Sorry sir. There are 2-3 Daisy's in this.
So I did this to avoid confusion.

381
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,671
I'll have to say a 100 lies
for not going to office.

382
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:46,230
Why is she calling me? Where is your phone?
- My phone is in the car. You pick up.

383
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,242
You pick up, sir.
-Pkkum

384
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:48,873
What is it, Chechi?

385
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,129
Sir is with..
He's not with me.

386
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,239
Is it?

387
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,128
Okay Chechi. I'll go to the
office and bring Sir. Okay?

388
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,600
Your request worked.

389
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,177
Daisy Chechi is in the hospital.
- Daisy Chechi?

390
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,381
lmean.. Preethi Chechi is in the hospital.
- Oh no!

391
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,606
It was on silent mode.

392
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,992
I told Chechi that Sreeyettan
must be in some team meeting.

393
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,001
Why are you getting tensed?
I had met the doctor.

394
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,360
I brought her here
because she felt nauseous.

395
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:33,177
There are chances that the delivery date
might be one week earlierthan expected.

396
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,405
That's why he got her admitted.

397
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,645
If she's under observation here,
we don't have to be tensed, right?

398
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,123
Thank you Chechi.

399
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,961
I'm happy!

400
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,930
How are you now?
- I'm all right.

401
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,486
Call me whenever
you need anything.

402
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,891
Husband, right?
- Yes.

403
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,991
You'll be here for a few days, right?
- Yes.

404
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,853
The advance for the
room should be paid.

405
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,123
Of course.
I'll pay it right away.

406
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,532
No hurry.
Take your time.

407
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,876
lwasjustteaching her.

408
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,093
This uncle doesn't know anything.

409
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,573
Excuse me.

410
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,412
Sreeram sir, right?

411
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,577
Not Samson, sir.
Jaison.

412
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,878
lwork here.

413
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:41,719
What do you want?

414
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,617
This phone..

415
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,716
What happened to it?
- Nothing.

416
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,081
I thought l'll sell it.

417
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,532
What is this, sir?

418
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,276
Are you so broke that you
have to sell your phone? - No.

419
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,692
I don't have the use
for such a heavy phone.

420
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,024
And I'm wasting a lot of
time on games & on the net.

421
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,696
So I thought l'll sell it.

422
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,266
I can't find any
games in this, sir.

423
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,176
Get that 3 GB here.

424
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,318
3 GB White.
- Okay bro.

425
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,631
Well, what price
would lget for it?

426
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,490
For this, sir..

427
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,598
I can give you 18 K.
- No. The bill..

428
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:23,956
Bill?
- No..

429
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,658
When I purchased this, the
bill was above 45,000. So..

430
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,201
I should get at least
25,000, right?

431
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:31,703
Okay.

432
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,810
So in short, even though
you're not in need of money,

433
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,507
you want to sell the phone to avoid
wasting time on net and games.

434
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,278
And you need Rs. 25,000 as well.
- Ya.

435
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,902
Sir, on my risk, I can
give you up to 20,000.

436
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,238
If I give you more than
that, I'll lose my job.

437
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,375
20 K is okay.

438
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,155
What about its charger & headset?
- It's at home.

439
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:57,542
I'll bring it.
- Make it fast.

440
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,178
I'm saving your number, sir.

441
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,681
Oh! With pleasure.

442
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,274
Thanks.

443
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,112
Aren't you counting it?

444
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,640
Sir, put this SIM card on another phone.

445
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,519
Another phone..
I'll have to buy..

446
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,953
How much does this cost?
- That's 3000.

447
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:33,765
Do onething, sir.

448
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,749
You can settle it later.

449
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,626
Well, Jaison.. This..

450
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,444
I trust you.

451
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,479
Here you go.

452
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,419
Thank you.
- Okay.

453
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,289
Sir..

454
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,068
Is this paper yours?

455
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,505

 forgot it since
I was in a hurry.

456
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:42,760
No. Tell me.

457
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,426
I want to discuss
something with you.

458
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,167
Okay..

459
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,735
Good night.
- Good night.

460
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,269
Shall we go?
- I'll go pay & come. - I'll wait outside.

461
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,734
Excuse me.. Bill, please.

462
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:14,939
One minute, sir.

463
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,261
Will anything happen?

464
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,187
Gautham!
- How are things?

465
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,741
Nothing, man.
Business is really dull.

466
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,294
Not just here.

467
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,991
Business is dull all
overlndia&the world.

468
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,985
You got 4 days time and
it's almost 4 weeks now.

469
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,303
I also can't stop him anymore.

470
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,258
Don't say that I
didn't warn you.

471
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,586
Excuse me, sir.
Your bill.

472
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:49,493
Okay then.

473
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,413
Cancel this.

474
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,148
Why sir?
Is he troublesome?

475
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,336
The guy whojust left?

476
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,143
In business, we would need
certain tricks like these.

477
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:05,996
I won't be here for a few days.

478
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,664
So just have an eye
on everything.

479
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,299
Of course.
What's your plan?

480
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,411
A small vacation, with Nimmy & my son.
- Vacation? Where?

481
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,546
lt's Mauritius this time.

482
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,777
Mauritius.
- He will miss many classes.

483
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,580
But he's not in 10th
grade yet, right?

484
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,603
Here. Keep this.

485
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,213
Okay.
- Okay. Done!

486
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,961
Hey! When I come back, this shop will
be here in the same condition, right?

487
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,702
l'lltry.

488
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,737
You should!

489
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:36,707
Excuse me.

490
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,448
When I came back here, I never even
dreamtthat life would become likethis.

491
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,282
Sometimes you have to
fall to rise higher, sir.

492
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,921
Be confident.

493
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,629
l'm surviving with that one hope.

494
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,261
Have you found a way to
return Lalaji's money?

495
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,476
To be frank, lam blank now.

496
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,768

 forgot to ask you while
narrating my sad story.

497
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,724
We have to clear these
debts somehow, sir.

498
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,901
Living without money
is really terrible.

499
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:20,562
There's one way.

500
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,526
Do you know him?

501
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,636
Notjust a builder.
He has many other businesses as well.

502
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:39,737
I know.

503
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,622
Will he be ableto help us?

504
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:48,984
Make him help us?
That means?

505
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:55,419
watch this, sir.

506
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,923
Isn't this that girl?
- Yes.

507
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,963
The social activist who
went missing 6 months back.

508
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,328
And the one sitting
inside the car,

509
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,511
But..
So what?

510
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,751
We'll show thisto him
and ask for some money.

511
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,918
and all our problems will
be solved with that.

512
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,664
My dear Samson, please
leave me out ofthis.

513
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,301
Neither have we met, nor
have we talked about this.

514
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:48,868
We won't meet..
- Sir, one minute.

515
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,404
You have to pay Lalaji's
money within a week.

516
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,807
Your daughter's education,
and your life hereafter.

517
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,695
If you've figured out a way
for all this, you may leave.

518
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,342
Well, how did you get this?

519
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,609
I had gone to the police control room to
check a CCTV complaint some time back.

520
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,879
The Keltron technician had
gone homefor Onam holidays.

521
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,584
Since he knows me from the shop,
he knew that I do such works.

522
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,851

 just went through the previous
day's visuals randomly.

523
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,225
That's when I saw this.

524
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,983
Immediately, I copied
this to my hard drive;

525
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,958
and deleted it from
the server there.

526
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,372
we'll show this clip to him, and
ask for some money from him.

527
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,800
If he's ready to give it, all our
problems would be solved, right?

528
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:56,907
But..

529
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,373
what if he informs the police?

530
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,083
isn't it his necessity that the
police does not know this?

531
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:03,514
Is it?

532
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,255
What's going on?

533
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,492
Will you get married?

534
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,046
Are you the normal police?

535
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,853
Or the moral police?

536
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,475
Just the normal police, dear.

537
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:24,935
Shall I ask?

538
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,238
I'll tell you.

539
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,429
On yourway here,

540
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,351
we had asked you to stop; but maybe
because you're busy, you didn't stop.

541
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,207
It's a vehicle that I pay super tax
for, sir. It might not stop sometimes.

542
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,219
Manu, don't do that.

543
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,517
It's all right. Leave it.
Nothing happened, right?

544
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:44,803
Now let's see what's in this.

545
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,276
Give me my purse.

546
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,762
What the f..
You bloody!

547
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,226
Shut up, you..

548
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:09,613
What is this, kid?

549
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,182

 asked you what's this?

550
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,188
Come.

551
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,001
Leave me.
- Come on. Let's go.

552
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:23,807
He's a big fraud.

553
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,326
Don't fall for all this.

554
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,459
lkka may not be able to
save you like this always.

555
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,237
Come.

556
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,481
That's Cl Shahjahan.
How is he?

557
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,642
Smart, right?

558
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,158
Johnson?

559
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,595
Sit down.

560
00:45:58,322 --> 00:45:59,960
Sir, this is Sherin.
She's my friend.

561
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:01,732
She knows everything.

562
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,849
Hello. Sreeram.
- Hi sir.

563
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,237
Take it to the station.

564
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,692
Sir, this will be trouble.

565
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,959
That boy is our Mayor
Augustine sir’s son.

566
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,352
Don't I always say?

567
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,617
You need the talent
to foresee things.

568
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,153
Go to the station.
I'll come there.

569
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,757
Well, where are you off
to, being all stylish?

570
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,692
That Kerala Matrimony?
Did it work out?

571
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,569
One is almost ready.

572
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,733
I'm going to meet her.

573
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,825
This will happen.
-Will it happen?

574
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,023
What if there's some problem?

575
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,810
There won't be any problem, sir.

576
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,905
Isn't it a favour that
we're doing for him?

577
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,826
lfl hadn't moved this clip
from the control room that day,

578
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:54,631
So in return for saving him, we're
asking some money from him. That's all!

579
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,049
Considering his range, we're
planning to ask up to 2 crores.

580
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,209
2 crores?

581
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:01,759
Sorry.

582
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,254
If we ask 2 crores, would
he able to give it?

583
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,095
Of course!

584
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,462
Sir, when I got access to this
clip, he wasjust a businessman.

585
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,533
lfl had gone with this then, he would
havetried to do something to me.

586
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,340
But now he's in the
heat of the election.

587
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,798
Don't worry, sir.

588
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,215
Just see this as a way to
solve all our problems.

589
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,718
We

.. If so, you both can
do it yourselves, right?

590
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,280
More than anything, we
need you for one reason.

591
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,542
You're older and more mature.
If you're with us, we'll be more confident.

592
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,359
even though it hasn't
been long since we met;

593
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,223

 feel like I have a strong
emotional bond with you, sir.

594
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,117
Maybe because I know about
all your problems, sir.

595
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,098
And didn't ltell you, sir?

596
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,797
This is like c
ich\/©d
movie dialogues..

597
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,205
Sir, this is my mom and sister.

598
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,962
And her studies might
get interrupted.

599
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:15,499
Sorry.

600
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,405
Wash room?

601
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,240
Wash room?

602
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,625
I'll go and come back soon.
- Take yourtime.

603
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,374
Hey! Will this guy be okay?

604
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:35,786
Why wouldn't he?

605
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,059
ldon't think he has
any courage at all.

606
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,995
And he has too much
of a decent look.

607
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,931
Such a guy is perfect for us.

608
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,632
Since he's in dire need of
money, he'll stand by us.

609
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,741
And if it's someone with intelligence
& courage, it will be trouble for us.

610
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,514
This is fine.

611
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,907
It's just to go and
collect the money, right?

612
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,184
He will do that.

613
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,778
So what say, sir?

614
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:02,880
Jaison,

615
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,911
I need some time to
think about this.

616
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:06,316
Sure.

617
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,171
We can't wait fortoo long.

618
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,799
Okay.
- Okay?

619
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,423
Come.

620
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,710
Where were you, sir?
- What is it, sister?

621
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,941
There's a bill that's pending.

622
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,311
Here.

623
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,824
If you don't pay it, it will be
difficult for us to give medicines.

624
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:39,196
That's why.
Sorry.

625
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,180
I'll pay it soon.

626
00:49:43,547 --> 00:50:09,740
Okay then.

627
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,696
Are you sure that I
myself should talk?

628
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,816
Then what? You'll get
money only if you work.

629
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,004
That's true.

630
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,800
It's not money that's most important.
- Of course.

631
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,313
Trust is m ost im po rtant.

632
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,378
So don't forget us once the
election is over, my dear sir.

633
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:44,409
My dear Lalaji, if I forget
you, whom do I remember?

634
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,871

 always need your support.

635
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,098
Do you have to say that?

636
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:49,471
Support is right here.

637
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,602
Thank you.
Thank you Lalaji.

638
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,360
He will pick up.

639
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:04,214
Okay.
- Stephen!

640
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,170
Come.

641
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,295
Abraham Mathen sir?
- Yes.

642
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,386
Sir, my name is Nancy.

643
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,899
I'm a supporter of yours.

644
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,129
Tell me Nancy.

645
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,946
l'm slightly busy.
It's okay. Tell me.

646
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,236
It will be very helpful to you.

647
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,147
Who did you send
itthrough, Nancy?

648
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,982
No, sir. I didn't send
it through anyone.

649
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,966
I've sent it to your
personal e-mail.

650
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,909
Mail?

651
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:57,147
Call me later.
- Sir, don't hang up!

652
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:57,988
I'll give you a clue.

653
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,453
a girl called Nithya Haridas
went missing, right?

654
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,348
lt's related to that case.

655
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,912
Sir, don't be tensed.

656
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:13,284
I'll call you after 10 minutes.
Please check your mail.

657
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,142
Give it.

658
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,238
Sir, shall I leave?

659
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,035
That property's
settlement is tomorrow.

660
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,800
Shahjahan has settled Mayor
Augustine's problem.

661
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,241
Okay. Good.

662
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,275
Okay.

663
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,635
Hey!
Don't leave now.

664
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,285
Okay. I'll wait.

665
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,672
(chanting prayers)

666
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:23,840
Call him.

667
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,152
Yes.

668
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,269
How much?
-We

..

669
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:44,694
3 crores!

670
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,530
Samson, lthink he left.

671
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,512
Ask..
- Sir?

672
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,125
But 3 crores..

673
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,529
Think about its value.

674
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,430
The benefits this city can
have because of this.

675
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,569
This society badly needs
a leader like you now, sir.

676
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,151
Not only winning this election;

677
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,810
we hope and wish that you become a
central minister as well, very soon.

678
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,589
lnstead..

679
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:17,988
if this footage is leaked, your
political future would be destroyed;

680
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,728
But we cannot even
imagine all that.

681
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,002
So please don't bargain, sir.

682
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,303
Okay.

683
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,604
Thank you.

684
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,310
Butl need sometime.

685
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,269
But sir.. we don't
have m uch time.

686
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,519
We're waiting to destroy this
footage once we get the money.

687
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,557
Even if it is with
us, it's dangerous.

688
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,292
If it goes missing somehow..

689
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,554
you would be finished, right?

690
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:43,847
See..

691
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,417
I can't do it during the
morning on any day.

692
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,850
You know right?

693
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,851
Election is coming.

694
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,182
There would be people
with me always.

695
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,207
That is, on March 8th;

696
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,357
There's a guest house of mine after
the toll plaza on the Highway.

697
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:00,909
We know, sir.
It's in your wife's name, right?

698
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,139
At 10 PM in the night.

699
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,912
The difficulties that girls face to
travel alone at night in our city,

700
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,311
You know it very
well, right sir?

701
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,135
if there would be any of your
friends at the guest house;

702
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,387
tell them not to complicate things
by doing anything to my friend.

703
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,585
You understood, right sir?

704
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:30,767
Understood.

705
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,631
A subtle threat, right?

706
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:36,773
Name..

707
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,261
Sreeram.

708
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,153
Don't break your head thinking about it.
I'll tell you.

709
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:45,448
Nancy.

710
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,708
ifl had thought about doing
something likethat;

711
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,545
l have always managed
to get it done.

712
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,347
And I'll get it done
hereafter as well.

713
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,918
Leave that.

714
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:58,962
And one morething..

715
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,626
if there's any change in whatever
we agreed upon, my dear;

716
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,786
you will know my wrath!

717
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,889
Then, notjust in surveillance cameras,
there won't be any record anywhere,

718
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,265
of what happened to you and your
friends or where you disappeared.

719
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:13,882
Got it?
- Sir..

720
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,560
There won't be any such problem.
You can trust us.

721
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,931
Like you forgot your fake name;

722
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,506
don't do anything
foolish with that clip.

723
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:25,782
Got it?

724
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:26,623
Okay sir.

725
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:50,747
Stephen!

726
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:20,071
'Is it a bum perthat's coming up the steps,
or is it a trick played by fate?'

727
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:24,389
'As the curse of Saturn tightens,
has the lucky star landed here by mistake?'

728
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:29,080
'Did a boat pull us up,
while we were drowning?'

729
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:33,465
'Did the detached bulb of
desire light up in a moment?'

730
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,951
'There's a festival of
fireworks in our hearts'

731
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:42,464
'lt's a secret that we have
hidden from the town'

732
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:46,970
'There's a festival of
fireworks in our hearts'

733
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:51,267
'lt's a secret that we have
hidden from the town'

734
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,842
Both of us will go in your car.

735
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,727
I will wait outside.

736
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,002
Simple.

737
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:20,450
Okay.
- Okay.

738
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,295
But we needn't take my car.
- Huh?

739
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,727
Well, it's a car 
 gifted her
during our last anniversary.

740
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,316
So using it for such a purpose,

741
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,743
We'll arrange another car.

742
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:33,877
We

..

743
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,014
There is such a car.

744
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:45,616
'If there's something we can't refuse
however much we're given, it's money'

745
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,447
'Even while we are on our deathbed'

746
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,030
'lfwe hear of money, our hands
stretch out on their own'

747
00:58:55,865 --> 00:59:00,570
'Oh heart, isthis a magic trick?
Is this a turning point in the story?'

748
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,540
'As it continues to rain, has a
treasure popped up in my courtyard?‘

749
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:09,646
'Would we be able to make money,
without moving our muscles?'

750
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:13,389
'There's a festival of
fireworks in our hearts'

751
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:18,087
'lt's a secret that we have
hidden from the town'

752
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:22,497
'There's a festival of
fireworks in our hearts'

753
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:27,253
'lt's a secret that we have
hidden from the town'

754
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,216
Sreeyetta!

755
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:42,996
When is this meeting?

756
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,881
Meeting is in the
morning tomorrow.

757
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,215
But I have to leave
tonight itself.

758
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,876
Or else I'll be late by
the time I reach there.

759
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,755
Please come back fast after
the meeting, Sreeyetta.

760
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,969

 feel that it won't
take much longer.

761
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,086
You should be right next to me.

762
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:57,934
I'll come back fast.

763
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:00,832
Then shall I leave, Jyothy?

764
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:03,854
lmean.. Preethi.

765
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,172
Why are you so tensed?

766
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,810
lt's when you're tensed that your
wife's name becomes Jyothy, Sati, etc.

767
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:15,652
Tell me, Sreeyetta.

768
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,346
We wanted to start a restaurant,
when we left from there, right?

769
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:21,925
It didn't happen.

770
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,538
I'm excited about meeting him,
and tensed too.

771
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:31,984
I know that you're doing all this for
me, our daughter &this 'coming soon'.

772
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,943
l have only one thing to tell you.

773
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,321
l have no complaints
about you, Sreeyetta.

774
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,981
I'm very very happy with you.
- I know.

775
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,023
Best of luck, Sreeyetta.

776
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:51,287
Take care.
- Okay.

777
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:52,874
I'll be back soon.
- Okay Sreeyetta.

778
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,642
Has she slept?
- She slept.

779
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,033
See you, Chechi.

780
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:17,647
Sir,

781
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,076
1 kg Orange, 2 packets of
biscuits & 1 water bottle.

782
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,532
- Let's go!
- Why are you so happy, Venu?

783
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:22,812
What a question, sir!

784
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:25,030
Didn't you say that we'll get the
money to pay Lalaji. That's why!

785
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,746
Today was the date
we had to pay him.

786
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:28,228
It won't be a problem, right?

787
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,953
I'll pay it tomorrow morning itself.
- They had called me.

788
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:33,137
I said I'm admitted in
the hospital with fever.

789
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:36,225
And that we'll pay in the morning. Fine?
- Start the car.

790
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:41,197
We have to pick up someone on the way.
He'll show us the correct route.

791
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,186
Sir, hold this.

792
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,590
If I get this money, l'll solve notjust
mine, but all your problems as well.

793
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,282
You'll do everything
that 
 wish for.

794
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,847
You're killing me
with your affection.

795
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,206
l have seen him
somewhere earlier.

796
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,222
No. l have seen you.

797
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,587
You can say that later, Venu.
Start the car.

798
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,432
I thought we'll get introduced, sir.
We're going for a good deed, right?

799
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:54,944
Ya Sherin.
Tell me.

800
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,133
Have you left?
- Ya. On our way.

801
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,249
There aren't any problems, right?
- No.

802
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,155
I'll call you after it's over.

803
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:02,933
Okay.
And ya,

804
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,631
will you escape once you get the money?
- Hang up & get lost.

805
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,388
Okay bye.
Good luck!

806
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:13,896
lt's Sherin.

807
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:16,771
Who is this Sherin?

808
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,389
Sreeram sir,

809
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,793
how come yourfixed this
meeting in the night?

810
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,051
Well, they are really busy people.

811
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,125
Don't these busy
people sleep at night?

812
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,559
They are all Americans.

813
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,087
The morning there is night here, right?

814
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:39,742
Oh! Like that!

815
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:47,930
Yourfriend?

816
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,165
Yes.

817
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:50,733
He's like a piece of my heart.

818
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,669
Though as much!

819
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,291
Sir.. Are you tensed?

820
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,445
Ya.

821
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:03,479
It's good.

822
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,705
Sir.

823
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,340
Go straight..

824
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:33,476
Are you sleeping, sir?

825
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,075
Sir, wake up.
We've reached the spot.

826
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,887
Poor thing. Must have slept
off because he's tired.

827
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,027
Sir!

828
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:41,794
Sir!
- How can he sleep like this?

829
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,680
I knew it when I saw his
fear, that he'll faint.

830
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,521
Oh no!

831
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:49,745
Sir! Get up!

832
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,949
Sir!

833
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,970
Phew! lthought he was done for.

834
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:58,505
Are you feeling good now, sir?

835
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,052
Come, sir.
We've reached the spot.

836
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,784
Sir, as we said.

837
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,161
Go straight, this way.
You have to walk a bit.

838
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:13,406
Enter the house,

839
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,247
and say that Nancy sent you.

840
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,179
Collect the money
and come back here.

841
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,225
Well, who's this Nancy?

842
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:19,765
Who is this Nancy?

843
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,518
Sir, it was Nancy who spoke
on the phone, right?

844
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:23,439
Oh! That Nancy!

845
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,323
Oh! Nancy!

846
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,204
Jackson, don't be angry.

847
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,125
My hands & legs are shivering,
my head is spinning;

848
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,238
I'm really tensed.

849
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,678
You go and collect it.
Please.

850
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:40,972
My dear, my legs aren't moving.

851
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,191
After planning & agreeing on
everything, don't screw up!

852
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:50,025
If you're doing nothing, what are you for?
To count money?

853
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:51,414
You want money for
just watching?

854
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:53,143
Sir, he's being disrespectful.
- So what, you schmuck?

855
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,221
Tell me sir.
I'll do anything.

856
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,789
Mother promise!
I can't do it. That's why!

857
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:05,439
You go and collect it.

858
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,768
You can take half of
my share if you want!

859
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:13,504
Now I understood.

860
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:17,785
Sir, I can't keep quiet
after knowing this.

861
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:19,814
I'm going to tell this
Preethi Chechi right away.

862
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:22,211
Dam u, you've misunderstood me.
This is not that.

863
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,906
l have no
misunderstandings, sir.

864
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,312
You started investing in
share markets again, right?

865
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,949
Sir, you reached this state, because
you listened to people like him.

866
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,518
Sir, don't you have a
minimum intelligence?

867
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:34,769
You want shares from Americans?

868
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,872
Sir, they are the ones who ask for
shares in anything and everything.

869
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,964
Sir, I said what! had to say.

870
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,103
Now it's your choice.

871
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:46,041
Hey! I'll tell you a good way to
invest the money you're going to get.

872
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,077
Can you go or not?

873
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,191
He can't!
- You..

874
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,877
Hey! I won't be able to do it.
My hands & legs aren't moving. That's why.

875
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:57,534
It's not anyone else's fault.

876
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,181
It's my fault.

877
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,046
lshould be blamed for calling
you along forthisjob!

878
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,258
I'll go!

879
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,840
I'll call you after getting the money.
Please come, then. To count!

880
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,131
Thomson,

881
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:11,968
Get lost!

882
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,510
Who is he?
- Can you please start the car?

883
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,262
Nancy sent me here.

884
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:19,335
Nancy?

885
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:20,670
Which Nancy?

886
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:31,647
Money?

887
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,470
You want the full amount?
Or a little less would be fine?

888
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,902
It's a deal between Nancy & Sir.

889
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,287
Will you be able to
bear the whole thing?

890
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,262
Sir, I could leave if
you give me the money.

891
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:49,565
Don't hurry, man.

892
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,537
I'm waiting for a
confirmation call from sir.

893
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,311
Here it is.

894
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,285
I'll bring the money.

895
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:34,610
What is it, Venu?

896
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:39,157
Sir, aren't there so many other
places to collect money?

897
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,311
Butthis bungalow in aforest?

898
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,580
Despite having so much
time in the morning,

899
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,889
why should we come in the night
when ghosts go for strolls?

900
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,497
Don't get scared, Venu.

901
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,375
Why are you behaving
like little kids?

902
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,238
That guy who went in,
has a fraud look.

903
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,836
I'm not at all able to
believe what you're saying.

904
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,402
Tell me the truth sir.
What's actually happening here?

905
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,673
Then we have to steal all the
money from that bungalow.

906
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,948
And then if we have time, we'll
set that bungalow on fire.

907
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,183
Isn't that enough?

908
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,389
This is why I don't talk much.

909
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,192
Ya. You weren't talking
at all, for so long.

910
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:19,722
Thank you very much!

911
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,822
Got the money.
It's too heavy. Can you come?

912
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,326
Shall I bring the car?

913
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,609
Don't bring that scoundrel.
You come alone. Please.

914
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,049
Venu, you wait here.
I'll be right back.

915
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,548
Sir, make it fast. If! get too
scared, I'll leave with the car.

916
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:52,555
Okay.

917
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,116
Oh God! He's not picking up!

918
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,053
Merlin,

919
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,281
Hello.
- He's gone, dear.

920
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,215
Our Jaison is gone!

921
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,771
With the money?
- Not with the money, he got shot.

922
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,466
I heard a gunshot
inside the farmhouse.

923
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,396
Sorry. Not one, two gunshots.
- Gunshot?

924
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,227
You must have imagined it.

925
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,928
I heard it.

926
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:26,542
But have you actually heard
any gunshots before this?

927
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,180
Sir, it won't be a gunshot.

928
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,169
Just go in and check, sir.
- Me?

929
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,220
Sir, please go in
and check, sir.

930
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:37,626
Please sir.

931
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:41,897
Okay.
I'll check.

932
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:36,990
Don't do anything stupid.

933
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:39,882
We don't need a
problem between us.

934
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:40,871
Give me the money & I'll go.

935
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,284
Don't make things
complicated, unnecessarily.

936
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:48,857
If something happens to
me, you'll be in trouble.

937
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:49,698
What trouble?

938
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:52,186
Your girl might give that
video footage to the media.

939
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,521
Then ldon't need money.

940
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,012
Done.

941
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:29,958
When will he come
back to his senses?

942
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:33,809
Oh no!

943
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,077
Then what do we do now?

944
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,540
Sir, listen to me.

945
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,328
No point in being tensed now.

946
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,248
Thomson, someone is
lying dead here.

947
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:44,046
It was me who was supposed to
lie dead there, instead of him!

948
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:44,887
Don't forget that.

949
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,077
I didn't do it on purpose.

950
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,203
lfl hadn't done that, he would have
killed me. You wanted that? Tell me, sir.

951
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,922
Thomson..

952
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,124
Sir, I don't know what happened.

953
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:59,048
He wasn't the same person who went to
take the money, when he came back.

954
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:02,461
Somewhere in this house, there's the money
that Mathen was supposed to give us.

955
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,280
Let's find it as soon as
possible and escape from here.

956
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:06,589
Thomson, enough.

957
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,292
You said there won't be any risk,
and one person is lying dead there.

958
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:11,678
Listen to me.
Let's leave immediately.

959
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,015
Without the money?

960
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,081
Jaison, listen to me.

961
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,511
You took me along because I
was older and mature, right?

962
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:22,150
Even if we stay a second
longer, we'll be trapped.

963
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,481
Let's leave as soon as we can.

964
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:25,153
Sir, anyway we came this far.

965
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,347
Let's just check for
the money once.

966
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:27,623
Money again?

967
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:28,851
Why? Don't you want the money?
- Yes!

968
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:30,799
Then come.

969
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,420
If the key was here, I could've
gone & come back in the morning.

970
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,555
What bloody nonsense is this?

971
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,167
Jaison, actually I was supposed to
come & collect the money, right?

972
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,895
Now don't eat my head saying that.
Please.

973
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,495
Sir, please go and see.
- Me?

974
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,115
Go and check, sir.

975
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:39,357
Didn't we see at the coffee house that day?
Cl Jehangir.

976
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:42,695
What is he doing here?
- I don't know.

977
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:44,597
Kiddo, you're not an SP, right?

978
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:47,814
So just follow what
ltell you clearly.

979
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,511
Sorry sir.

980
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:51,651
What's the situation there now?

981
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,104
You handle the situation there.

982
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:06,495
I'm not able to lock it.

983
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,488
Don't go.
Wait.

984
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:13,982
Sir, go..

985
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,033
Jaison, I'm really scared.

986
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,701
We saw him at the caf\/©, right?

987
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,764
Sir, don't be tensed
unnecessarily.

988
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:23,293
Now only both of us know
what happened here.

989
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:26,763
Sti

.. - Sir, you just be cool
& handle him. He will leave.

990
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:30,395
Sir, it's because I can't go.
Please do at least this.

991
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,774
There won't be any problem, right?
- No problem.

992
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,546
Then I'll go?
- Yes.

993
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,186
Shall I go?
- Please!

994
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,061
Pray for me.

995
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,597
Who are you?
- I'm new here. Sreekkuttan.

996
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,815
Who are you, sir?
I didn't recognize you.

997
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,079
Don't be shocked.

998
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,704
lam Cl Shahjahan.
- Gosh!

999
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:01,045
I told you not to
be shocked, rig ht?

1000
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,083
I tried. I couldn't stop
myself from being shocked.

1001
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:04,753
Where is Stephen?

1002
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,126
Stephen..
- Stephen?

1003
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:09,620
Why?
- Just like that.

1004
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:10,737
Just like that?

1005
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,682
He went to buy a
bottle of booze.

1006
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:17,046
Well.. 
..

1007
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:19,715
You must be scared, right?

1008
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:22,337
l was afraid.

1009
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,862
But he doesn't booze, right?
- Started now.

1010
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,770
No. I mean, I started now.

1011
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,512
I'm not able to sleep properly
unless I have 2 drinks, sir.

1012
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,717
Did Madam come here?
- No. Madam didn't come.

1013
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:39,850
Then who else came?
- No one else came.

1014
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:42,758
Sir..

1015
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:44,893
Send him away..

1016
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,230
Sreekkuttan,

1017
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,504
So you didn't know anything?

1018
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:53,950
I don't know anything.

1019
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,106
I didn't get you.

1020
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:00,976
Oh no!

1021
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:03,912
It's been one hour.

1022
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:07,645
Stephen is not picking
up his phone.

1023
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,555
When did he leave?
- That..

1024
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,587
His car is lying outside.
How did he go then?

1025
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,624
That's true... His car is outside..

1026
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,039
What is it?

1027
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,448
When lthought about
Abraham sir's death..

1028
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,532
He was the only hope
of many poor people.

1029
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:41,510
Leave it.

1030
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,080
What'sthe point in crying now?
- Yes.

1031
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:44,742
Go and bring some water.

1032
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:46,799
Let the booze get here, sir.

1033
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,195
I want to drink it now.

1034
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:54,279
We can now see the visuals of the car
thatAbraham Mathen travelled in.

1035
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:56,993
The lorry that caused the
accident left without stopping,

1036
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:58,838
That has given rise to
many suspicions.

1037
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:03,905
I'm going now.

1038
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,402
Police handed overthe bodies of Abraham
Mathen & driverto hospital officials,

1039
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,357
a few minutes back.

1040
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:10,245
Sir!

1041
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,518
Why did you say that
Stephen has gone out?

1042
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,373
Then should lsay that
he's in the cupboard?

1043
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,266
Now will he leave without
meeting Stephen?

1044
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,158
Oh! That's a problem!

1045
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,180
Did you know?

1046
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:22,743
Abraham Mathen is dead.

1047
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:23,825
Ya. I heard.

1048
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,341
l have an idea.

1049
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:30,032
Without taking the money?

1050
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,237
You & your money!

1051
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:34,278
Come if you want to.
- Sir! Sir!

1052
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:18,480
Stephen!

1053
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:36,932
We

..

1054
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,501
Let methink.

1055
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,498
Remember that it's a police
officer who's knocked out.

1056
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,626
I don't knock out any random police
officer on the 8th of every month!

1057
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,009
Let methink.

1058
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,044
Think..

1059
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,348
What is it, Chechi? Tell me.
- Sreeyetta..

1060
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:57,785
Preethi, what is it, dear?
-Are you driving?

1061
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:05,925
Are you busy now?
- Yes.

1062
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:08,864
what happened?

1063
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,177
If you're not too far away,

1064
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:14,870
Dear, l

1065
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:18,192
My labour pain has started.

1066
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,744
Take the phone from her.
- Can you come now?

1067
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:23,979
Mom.

1068
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,097
Sreeram.
- Yes chechi.

1069
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,914
Preethi is being taken
to the labour room now.

1070
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,111
Don't be tensed.
You try to come early.

1071
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,123
Bye.

1072
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:56,173
I thought you escaped that way..

1073
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:28,873
How come you're early today?

1074
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:30,750
Yourteam's match is
at two o'clock, right?

1075
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:33,938
Us fans are like this.
It's a warm-up.

1076
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,595
Carry on.

1077
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:43,625
What is it?

1078
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:46,594
Mathen sir died in an accident.

1079
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,791
When?

1080
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,076
It hasn't been much time.

1081
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:53,522
It was on the highway.
He died on the spot.

1082
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:54,970
Son..

1083
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,342
so the support we gave him?

1084
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:57,572
My money?

1085
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:12,313
Don't worry.
I'll go and check.

1086
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,144
Sir, will your team
win at least today?

1087
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:19,180
They will win, sir.
They will!

1088
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:38,885
Who are you all?

1089
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,549
To be frank,

1090
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,356
we came to give a
sad news to you.

1091
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,517
Your husband,

1092
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,556
She's the one who gave a
contract to kill him!

1093
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:55,693
Wow!
- Then wouldn't she know that?

1094
01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:57,999
Right Madam?

1095
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,695
So you came to arrest
me and Stephen, is it?

1096
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:01,536
Where is Stephen?

1097
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,863
If it was to arrest you,
would I come alone?

1098
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:08,415
Stephen was a good
friend of mine.

1099
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,931
I've known about your
affairfora long time.

1100
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,788
But what you did today,
was sheer stupidity.

1101
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:17,496
You could have avoided
killing Mathen.

1102
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,695
He hadn't even told me a word
about taking such a step.

1103
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:25,030
Shahjahan, I know that you'll
do anything for money.

1104
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:26,886
I'll give you any
amount you ask for.

1105
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:28,063
Can you help us?

1106
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:31,232
lcan only..

1107
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,973
I can only save you
alone now, Madam.

1108
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:35,236
Why?

1109
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:47,682
Tell me the truth.

1110
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:50,719
We

..

1111
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:52,492
Where is he?
- He is here. - Sir!

1112
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:56,395
He's in that cupboard.

1113
01:25:56,885 --> 01:25:58,170
He is in that cupboard.

1114
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:13,108
Who?

1115
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:14,761
Who did this?

1116
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:16,811
I don't know!

1117
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:42,161
'My sweetheart should sleep'

1118
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:46,006
'Sleep, closing your eyes'

1119
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:47,796
Jaison, what did you do?

1120
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:49,520
Sherin, I'll tell you.
We don't have time now.

1121
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:50,772
Go to that room.

1122
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:51,818
And look if our money is there.

1123
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,172
Go! Trust me!
Just go.

1124
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:01,589
Sir..

1125
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:03,539
None of this is on purpose.

1126
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,397
All this is just happening..

1127
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:09,531
Jaison!

1128
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:14,502
Hey!

1129
01:27:24,339 --> 01:27:25,385
We don't need this, Johnson.

1130
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:35,690
Sir.

1131
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:36,891
Look what's lying here.

1132
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:41,944
And what's lying there are corpses!

1133
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:10,236
Jaison!

1134
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:18,059
Sir, what is this?

1135
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:18,900
Sir..

1136
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:20,688
Say something quickly.

1137
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:22,293
Otherwise, he'll run away now.

1138
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:23,538
If he runs..

1139
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,541
What is it, Venu?

1140
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,324
Don'tjust stand there.
Come and sit.

1141
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,697
Sir, don't kill me.
Whatdid Ido? Sir!

1142
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:44,959
Shut up!
- Hey! Jaison!

1143
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,196
Venu, if you keep shouting like this,
we won't be able to leave from here.

1144
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:55,498
First you stop crying.

1145
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:58,944
Sir, you did exactly
what you said.

1146
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:04,130
I don't have the power to see you
burning this house as well, sir.

1147
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,874
Let's go, sir.
Let's go!

1148
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,648
Venu, we can't go like that.

1149
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:11,533
First you listen to me.

1150
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:15,094
Don't you always talk about
your old boss' cars?

1151
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,430
Like that, if you
co-operate with us;

1152
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,937
we'll give you money to buy
2 cars, as you desired.

1153
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:26,668
Will you?

1154
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,242
We will.
Definitely.

1155
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:31,592
Who is this now?
- That Nancy, right?

1156
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,565
Oh! Is this her?

1157
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:44,319
Stop it.

1158
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:45,992
What's there to laugh so much?

1159
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:50,166
How can I not laugh by
seeing all this, kiddo?

1160
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:56,388
Then you needn't see
anything anymore.

1161
01:29:58,726 --> 01:29:59,681
Will you kill me?

1162
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:01,302
Then kill me.

1163
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:03,738
Hey! Jaison!

1164
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,240
And you think you can
escape afterthat?

1165
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:08,876
Kiddo,

1166
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,050
if you kill one amongst us, you'll
know the true colours of us policemen.

1167
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:14,844
Wherever you go and hide,
we'll hunt you down.

1168
01:30:15,209 --> 01:30:17,598
If your police can come out
ofthis country and catch me,

1169
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,101
l'll consider it as my fate.

1170
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:21,990
Leave alone the country,

1171
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:24,788
none of you can leave even
my circle limit tonight.

1172
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:27,849
lt's Abraham Mathen who's dead.

1173
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:30,496
The vehicle that struck him
hasn't been found yet.

1174
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:32,705
There's police checking
on all the roads.

1175
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:35,565
If you land in front of
them with so much money;

1176
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:37,505
l needn't say
anything more, right?

1177
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:40,731
There was tight
checking on the way.

1178
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,221
You can escape.

1179
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:46,300
But I should help you forthat.

1180
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:47,972
Well, what do you mean, sir?

1181
01:30:48,976 --> 01:30:49,795
No!

1182
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,502
Let's go ahead as per our plan.

1183
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,479
Let him say it first.
Then we'll decide.

1184
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,032
Not Akbar.
Shahjahan.

1185
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,259
Don't we all know that
Shahjahan is not Akbar?

1186
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:04,389
They are 2 people, right?
- Keep quiet.

1187
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:13,149
Destroying all the evidences here,
including yourfingerprints;

1188
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:16,563
In a way that no one would
investigate and reach you;

1189
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:18,570
l'll frame this case.

1190
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,788
And, the road blocks set by the police.

1191
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:23,675
I know those exact places.

1192
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:27,217
If I am with you, you can
easily leave with this money.

1193
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:31,919
I came here today to get
some money from Stephen,

1194
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:33,648
promising to settle Abraham
Mathen's murder case.

1195
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:37,197
So if you give me a share from
the money you got from inside;

1196
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:40,382
I'll get this case
closed forever today.

1197
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:44,576
When you do a crime, shouldn't you
do in the proper way, children?

1198
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:47,673
Close all the loopholes
and leave the country.

1199
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:52,075
Sir, shall I untie him?

1200
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,429
When you set out for
such illicit activities,

1201
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:13,409
lkka may not be able to
come and save you always.

1202
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,798
We're going to set a crime scene here.
- Isn't she dead?

1203
01:32:17,798 --> 01:32:18,787
Are they planning something?

1204
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:20,635
Do what I ask you
to do, correctly.

1205
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:21,886
Just what I ask you to do.

1206
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:23,644
Venu!

1207
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:40,452
What is it, Venu?
- Sreeram sir,

1208
01:34:40,975 --> 01:34:42,545
About the 2 cars
you said earlier..

1209
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:44,078
They agreed to it, right?

1210
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:46,967
Just tell them that I
meant full option cars.

1211
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:50,547
Jaison, shouldn't we split this?

1212
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:53,089
Carrying it with
us is not so safe.

1213
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:01,335
Is it?

1214
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:03,623
I'll come right away, Chechi.

1215
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,200
You should be with her.

1216
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:07,808
It's a girl.

1217
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,786
Even if you split it or
not, I have to go.

1218
01:35:14,275 --> 01:35:15,376
I want to see my daughter.

1219
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:16,217
Can you keep quiet?

1220
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:17,812
Daughter, it seems!

1221
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:19,734
It will be there only..
- Don't talk about my daughter..

1222
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:26,055
Which hospital is yourwife in?

1223
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:27,929
RIMS.

1224
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,457
Venu, drive to RlMS hospital.

1225
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:35,836
Stop it.

1226
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:41,003
You're not the one who decides
where this car should go to.

1227
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:43,673
Keep that trap to yourself.

1228
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:48,659
It isn't a stick that pierced through
your leg. There's a bullet in there!

1229
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:51,732
There's a friend of mine in that hospital.
Dr. Anil

1230
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:56,737
And he can see his
daughter and wife as well.

1231
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,663
That's all. It's not
a trap or anything!

1232
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,046
So shall I drop you all at
the hospital and leave?

1233
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:09,899
Don't we have to buy new cars?
- Yes. Full option.

1234
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:11,272
Full option.

1235
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:12,811
Start the car.

1236
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:45,043
All of you are leaving?
Then what about the suitcase?

1237
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:49,686
Don't take so much trouble.

1238
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:52,699
Then who will stand guard?

1239
01:36:55,242 --> 01:36:56,083
Oh no!

1240
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:58,714
I can't do that.
Don't ask me to do that. Please.

1241
01:37:08,556 --> 01:37:11,207
Even though there are only my wife's
clothes in the bag, it's too heavy.

1242
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:14,754
Even though you didn't ask,

1243
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,421
Shahjahan,

1244
01:38:10,084 --> 01:38:10,925
Bro..

1245
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:12,359
You just..

1246
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,272
I won't do such jobs.

1247
01:38:14,922 --> 01:38:15,763
Help me out, man.

1248
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:19,089
If someone here knows
this, my head will roll.

1249
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,059
Bro, please.
Do it.

1250
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:30,978
Jaison..

1251
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:40,867
Bro, I'll wait outside.
Call me when it's over.

1252
01:38:41,282 --> 01:38:42,761
This will take sometime.

1253
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,361
Okay sir.

1254
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:48,805
I'll do the needful, sir.

1255
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:52,399
Okay sir.

1256
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:04,044
Manu, what's happening?

1257
01:39:06,006 --> 01:39:07,746
Weren't you able to
trace Leena Mathen yet?

1258
01:39:10,678 --> 01:39:12,691
Who took you into
the police, man?

1259
01:39:13,714 --> 01:39:15,261
Listen to me now.

1260
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:19,713
That Leena Mathen has a guest house.

1261
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:22,967
Do one thing. Go there with
a small team and check.

1262
01:39:23,657 --> 01:39:25,170
l'll message the address to you.

1263
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:26,467
Okay?

1264
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:38,226
Your name is Sherin, right?

1265
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:41,411
You work in that caf\/©, right?
- Yes sir.

1266
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:50,047
Why should you say
sorry for that?

1267
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:52,131
He was the one who
created a problem right?

1268
01:39:52,419 --> 01:39:54,080
He is really tensed, sir.

1269
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:56,284
And he is in too much pain as well.
That's well.

1270
01:40:01,161 --> 01:40:02,002
And sir,

1271
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:03,842
about what happened
in the guest house,

1272
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:11,521
You needn't be scared anymore.

1273
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:14,186
We re-arranged that spot, right?

1274
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:16,940
Now whichever mighty one might
investigate, nothing will happen.

1275
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,114
And whatever
investigation it is,

1276
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:23,384
everything from the FIR
onwards, passesthrough me.

1277
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:24,225
I know, sir.

1278
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:40,368
Shall we go for a walk?

1279
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:44,225
My back, after climbing all the stairs.
I'm really tired.

1280
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,382
Sherin, shall we have tea from
the canteen. l have a headache.

1281
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:50,885
To have tea?

1282
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:52,119
Let's go!
Come.

1283
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:53,554
Read the newspaper.

1284
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:57,519
Dear, buy a tea
and snack for me.

1285
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:17,978
Thank you.

1286
01:41:44,798 --> 01:41:46,049
Will this get over anytime soon?

1287
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:49,406
It won't come out as
fast as it got in.

1288
01:41:51,305 --> 01:41:52,909
Bloody he

..

1289
01:41:57,411 --> 01:41:58,252
Behave!

1290
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,238
You're still tensed, right?

1291
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:25,217
Be tensed;

1292
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:26,905
but can you avoid
calling me sir?

1293
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:31,032
I really like being
called 'lkka'.

1294
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:33,225
If it's not too much
trouble, call me that.

1295
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:35,943
So you know to smile?

1296
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:37,963
Stop it, lkka.

1297
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,035
Sherin..

1298
01:43:25,465 --> 01:43:27,126
Sorry sir.
- It's okay.

1299
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:31,425
Shall we go and check?

1300
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:35,134
Poorthing. He got
stuck in this somehow.

1301
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:40,640
You know how many such
people 
 see daily?

1302
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:43,090
(blabbering in sleep)

1303
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:46,827
Come.

1304
01:43:48,655 --> 01:43:49,792
There it goes again.

1305
01:44:04,771 --> 01:44:06,193
Like you said, he
is an innocent chap.

1306
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:09,297
Seeing the happiness on
his face, I feel jealous.

1307
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:11,341
Wife, kids..

1308
01:44:12,346 --> 01:44:14,041
One needs to be lucky to
have all that, right?

1309
01:44:14,548 --> 01:44:16,277
I can only pray forthis to God.

1310
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:19,226
He must be bored of
hearing my complaint now.

1311
01:44:20,854 --> 01:44:21,695
Excuse me.

1312
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:23,697
Who are you?

1313
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:25,495
We are Sreeram's friends.

1314
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:27,338
Is it?
And where's sir?

1315
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:29,341
He is inside.
What do you want?

1316
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:30,851
lcameto see him..

1317
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:32,559
Sir, congrats!

1318
01:44:33,333 --> 01:44:34,231
Thank you.

1319
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:36,180
Preethi is fine, right?

1320
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:39,402
She slept only now.
No other problem.

1321
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:41,443
Sir, this bill..

1322
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:44,137
Okay.
- Okay.

1323
01:44:45,512 --> 01:44:47,150
No hurry.
You can pay in the morning.

1324
01:44:56,923 --> 01:44:57,821
I'll be right back.

1325
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:13,133
Where's the billing counter?

1326
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:15,196
No Sherin.
That's not right.

1327
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:16,606
What's not right?

1328
01:45:16,843 --> 01:45:19,446
We took so in uch trouble to get this
money, for such necessities, right?

1329
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:21,050
Whatever you say,
I don't want this money.

1330
01:45:22,516 --> 01:45:24,211
Then pay the bill with
the money you have.

1331
01:45:26,019 --> 01:45:27,475
Sherin, you go and pay the bill.

1332
01:45:29,423 --> 01:45:30,264
Come.

1333
01:45:35,429 --> 01:45:37,647
Whatever happened today, I've
seen such things only in movies.

1334
01:45:38,765 --> 01:45:40,687
Such things do not end well.

1335
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:44,007
That's why I said I don't
want this undeserved money.

1336
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,967
There's no point in saying that
it's undeserved money, sir.

1337
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:55,542
They also don't
deserve this money.

1338
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:59,130
They would have killed that
poor girl on that day itself.

1339
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:01,495
Don't you feel that such
people should be punished?

1340
01:46:07,594 --> 01:46:09,607
All this is much more
than I can handle.

1341
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:27,454
Come here.

1342
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:31,325
Leave my hand.

1343
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:34,289
Why did you get inside?

1344
01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:36,563
That?

1345
01:46:37,124 --> 01:46:37,965
To see the baby.

1346
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:39,686
I also like babies a lot, man.

1347
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,486
You're not supposed to come
empty handed to see a newborn.

1348
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:47,670
But right now I don't
have anything with me.

1349
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:51,877
A golden hip chain will
be ready, as my gift.

1350
01:46:53,673 --> 01:46:54,514
You are lucky, man.

1351
01:46:57,144 --> 01:46:59,749
With this all your problems in
life will be over. Wait & watch.

1352
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:03,603
l have this ability
to foresee things.

1353
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:16,527
I'm here only.

1354
01:47:19,733 --> 01:47:20,984
Okay bro.
I'll come now.

1355
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:24,342
It's over.
Let's go there.

1356
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:35,455
Leave it.

1357
01:48:20,026 --> 01:48:21,539
Tell me, son.
- I checked in the office.

1358
01:48:23,296 --> 01:48:24,957
That Stephen is not
answering his phone.

1359
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:28,379
Then what do we do?
- Don't be tensed.

1360
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:30,372
l'm outside Mathen's guest house.

1361
01:48:30,737 --> 01:48:31,931
I think Stephen is here.

1362
01:48:32,672 --> 01:48:33,513
Check.

1363
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:35,988
If he's not there, catch
hold of him, wherever he is.

1364
01:48:49,789 --> 01:48:51,074
You did a great help for me.

1365
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:54,763
What?
- Can you please leave?

1366
01:49:03,136 --> 01:49:04,831
Jaison, the place you
mentioned is quite far.

1367
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:06,900
Isn't it risky to go so
far with so much money?

1368
01:49:08,108 --> 01:49:08,949
Jaison..

1369
01:49:09,943 --> 01:49:11,080
The place I told
you, is close by.

1370
01:49:11,678 --> 01:49:12,519
It's really safe.

1371
01:49:13,113 --> 01:49:14,626
No one will ever
come to that area.

1372
01:49:17,617 --> 01:49:18,754
Then let's go there, right?

1373
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:23,439
Since when did you start making
decisions for me? - Jaison, leave her.

1374
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:26,452
I've told you several times,

1375
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:28,396
don't try to advise me.

1376
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:29,669
Okay.

1377
01:49:31,665 --> 01:49:32,802
Let's go to the place he said.

1378
01:49:34,668 --> 01:49:36,681
lfl play around with you guys,
all of us will be in trouble.

1379
01:49:37,103 --> 01:49:37,944
Come, if you want to.

1380
01:49:39,773 --> 01:49:40,614
Come.

1381
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:47,482
I'm really tired. Let's go quickly.
- Okay. Get inside.

1382
01:49:55,088 --> 01:49:55,929
Where is our car?

1383
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:05,098
Where's the car?

1384
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:06,759
He must have moved the
car somewhere else.

1385
01:50:09,069 --> 01:50:10,673
Isn't this an adjustment
between him and you?

1386
01:50:12,172 --> 01:50:13,184
Don't talk nonsense.

1387
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:17,879
He is not such a person.

1388
01:50:18,378 --> 01:50:20,710
Stop shouting like
this, and call him.

1389
01:50:31,057 --> 01:50:32,627
He's not answering.
- Now don't bother.

1390
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:34,234
He escaped.

1391
01:50:51,778 --> 01:50:52,642
Where were you?

1392
01:50:52,879 --> 01:50:54,187
Sir, that snack gave me trouble.
- Hey!

1393
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:56,127
Where's your car?
- Car is..

1394
01:50:57,884 --> 01:50:58,725
Where is my car?

1395
01:50:58,952 --> 01:51:00,965
Sir, my car..
- Where's the car? Whom did you give it to?

1396
01:51:01,354 --> 01:51:03,015
Move! Whom will I give it to?

1397
01:51:03,456 --> 01:51:04,297
Here.

1398
01:51:05,759 --> 01:51:06,600
Sir..

1399
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:09,383
Where is my car?
My car..

1400
01:51:12,766 --> 01:51:14,870
Did you see a white Evalia
car that was parked there?

1401
01:51:15,268 --> 01:51:17,782
Someone from the workshop
came and took it.

1402
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:32,463
The car was taken by
none otherthan Lalaji.

1403
01:51:33,386 --> 01:51:34,694
Lalaji?
Why?

1404
01:51:35,088 --> 01:51:36,953
Yesterday was the last
date to return his money.

1405
01:51:45,498 --> 01:51:47,967
We should get that carfrom in
there somehow, immediately.

1406
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:48,808
We

..

1407
01:51:49,069 --> 01:51:51,082
Should we mess with Lalaji?
- You shouldn't talk again.

1408
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:52,439
No.

1409
01:51:52,439 --> 01:51:53,918
Lalaji won't be
here at this time.

1410
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,605
Maximum 2 or3 people.

1411
01:51:56,009 --> 01:51:57,465
If we're strong
enough, we can do it.

1412
01:51:58,244 --> 01:52:01,338
But make it fast. If they see the
bag in the boot, it's all over.

1413
01:52:02,148 --> 01:52:04,161
For you it's just one car.
For me, it's two cars.

1414
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:05,358
Venu!

1415
01:52:05,785 --> 01:52:06,922
You also should come with us.

1416
01:52:07,387 --> 01:52:09,082
We'll deal with the people inside.

1417
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:11,697
But within that time, you should
bring the car outside. Got it?

1418
01:52:13,093 --> 01:52:14,321
What should ldo?

1419
01:52:14,794 --> 01:52:16,125
You just stay here.

1420
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:17,237
Here?
- Okay.

1421
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:18,371
So as we agreed...

1422
01:52:27,774 --> 01:52:28,615
Here.

1423
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:39,759
Careful.

1424
01:52:43,323 --> 01:52:44,164
No need, right?

1425
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:45,721
Sir, should I go?
-Jumpfast.

1426
01:52:45,992 --> 01:52:47,277
Venu,jump!

1427
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:52,725
Only you can do it.

1428
01:53:25,999 --> 01:53:28,797
Perfect time to ask for the car.

1429
01:53:33,907 --> 01:53:34,748
Sir..

1430
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:39,285
What happened?

1431
01:53:40,947 --> 01:53:42,198
What happened?
- Not possible.

1432
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:44,120
There are much more people
there, than he said.

1433
01:53:44,417 --> 01:53:45,987
So many people there
at this time..

1434
01:53:46,953 --> 01:53:48,375
What do we do now?
- Where is Venu?

1435
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:50,330
Where is Venu?

1436
01:53:51,124 --> 01:53:52,284
Venu?

1437
01:53:55,862 --> 01:53:57,261
Who are you looking for?
- How did you?

1438
01:54:00,934 --> 01:54:02,663
Damn!
Lalaji is also here.

1439
01:54:03,102 --> 01:54:05,286
This is why wise people say
that greediness is dangerous.

1440
01:54:06,206 --> 01:54:09,275
Hearing your word, now
my job is gone.

1441
01:54:09,275 --> 01:54:10,754
Shut up.
- You shut up & get lost.

1442
01:54:13,012 --> 01:54:14,650
What do you want?
- You'll ask me to shut up?

1443
01:54:14,948 --> 01:54:15,789
What are you doing?

1444
01:54:15,982 --> 01:54:18,086
Leave me, sir. He has
been acting too smart.

1445
01:54:20,653 --> 01:54:22,200
Don't try to mess with me.

1446
01:54:23,022 --> 01:54:24,624
Sir.. Sreeram sir..

1447
01:54:24,624 --> 01:54:26,171
Siris going..

1448
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:31,171
What's he doing?

1449
01:54:36,436 --> 01:54:37,277
Hello!

1450
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,039
Yes Lalu..
- Who are you?

1451
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:43,716
l've reached outside.

1452
01:54:44,177 --> 01:54:45,018
You came just now?

1453
01:54:46,246 --> 01:54:47,383
Whata great timing!

1454
01:54:49,182 --> 01:54:50,251
Just hold on fora second.

1455
01:54:52,218 --> 01:54:54,903
Just a minute.. Lalu..
I mean, I have to meet Lalaji.

1456
01:54:59,158 --> 01:55:00,170
Thank you.
- Be careful, sir.

1457
01:55:01,327 --> 01:55:02,168
Thank you.

1458
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:03,336
Ya Lalu,

1459
01:55:03,696 --> 01:55:05,652
I'm coming.
Did you eat anything?

1460
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:07,540
Is that so?

1461
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:53,339
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1462
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:55,168
I am Sreeram.

1463
01:55:56,015 --> 01:55:57,152
Wanna meet Sohanlal.

1464
01:55:57,951 --> 01:55:58,792
Lalaji?

1465
01:55:59,018 --> 01:55:59,859
Not here.

1466
01:56:01,254 --> 01:56:02,949
Your security said he is inside.

1467
01:56:03,389 --> 01:56:04,788
I wanna meet him.
It's urgent.

1468
01:56:05,658 --> 01:56:07,762
l have his money with me.
That's why.

1469
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:10,527
Meet?
- Meet.

1470
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:13,368
Secu rity?
- Security.

1471
01:56:13,967 --> 01:56:15,070
Lalaji?
- Lalaji.

1472
01:56:15,668 --> 01:56:16,999
Money?
- Money.

1473
01:56:18,738 --> 01:56:19,579
Come.

1474
01:56:26,279 --> 01:56:27,613
Where's the money
that was in this?

1475
01:56:27,613 --> 01:56:28,454
Who took it?

1476
01:56:28,715 --> 01:56:29,556
No idea!

1477
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:33,111
When I entered the main road from
there, a police Jeep was going there.

1478
01:56:34,687 --> 01:56:36,905
What all happened here
within one night!

1479
01:56:39,759 --> 01:56:42,239
How many croresl
gave him, oh God!

1480
01:56:50,803 --> 01:56:51,644
Sir..

1481
01:56:52,372 --> 01:56:53,509
One Mr. Sreeram is
here to meet you.

1482
01:56:57,677 --> 01:56:58,518
Come.

1483
01:57:00,113 --> 01:57:00,954
Thank you.

1484
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:03,729
How come you're here at this time?
- Lalaji, sorry.

1485
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:06,129
I know I'm late by
a few days but..

1486
01:57:06,519 --> 01:57:08,760
lwas running around
to arrange the money.

1487
01:57:10,256 --> 01:57:11,268
So..
- So?

1488
01:57:11,624 --> 01:57:12,932
So lgotthe full amount.
- Huh?

1489
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:17,155
I would feel restless ifl go
home without returning it to you;

1490
01:57:18,598 --> 01:57:21,283
While I was waiting outside, the security
guard told me that you're inside.

1491
01:57:23,169 --> 01:57:24,010
Here.

1492
01:57:24,303 --> 01:57:25,144
Sreeram sir..

1493
01:57:26,172 --> 01:57:27,571
Lalaji, the full amount is there.

1494
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:31,914
Sreeram sir..

1495
01:57:32,378 --> 01:57:34,835
You should be a role model for
people who borrow money.

1496
01:57:38,384 --> 01:57:39,487
Lalaji, are you happy?

1497
01:57:40,853 --> 01:57:41,694
That's enough.

1498
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:45,384
The time you chose to
come here was bad, man.

1499
01:57:46,125 --> 01:57:46,966
Why Lalaji?

1500
01:57:48,394 --> 01:57:50,225
I lost a lot of money
unnecessarily.

1501
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:56,581
Getting destroyed every second.

1502
01:57:58,805 --> 01:58:00,136
Why? Isn't it a problem for you?

1503
01:58:00,807 --> 01:58:02,536
Do you watch only cricket?
- No.

1504
01:58:03,376 --> 01:58:05,105
It's our team, right?
They will definitely win.

1505
01:58:05,545 --> 01:58:06,386
Ya rig ht!

1506
01:58:06,712 --> 01:58:08,225
How are they going to win now?

1507
01:58:09,615 --> 01:58:10,513
lt's injurytime now.

1508
01:58:13,486 --> 01:58:15,351
There's still time for
one goal, Lalaji.

1509
01:58:17,857 --> 01:58:18,698
Goal!

1510
01:58:23,496 --> 01:58:24,337
Goal!

1511
01:58:25,731 --> 01:58:26,572
Sir..

1512
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:34,300
To a person like you..
Sheesh!

1513
01:58:35,708 --> 01:58:36,959
Your money..

1514
01:58:38,277 --> 01:58:39,608
But I collected it back
already, rig ht?

1515
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:43,844
Don't hesitate at all.

1516
01:58:44,283 --> 01:58:46,719
That poor Venu's car
was brought here.

1517
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:48,141
If you could release it..

1518
01:58:48,488 --> 01:58:49,329
Is it?
- Yes.

1519
01:58:51,858 --> 01:58:52,699
Anything else?

1520
01:58:55,294 --> 01:58:56,135
Tell me, sir.

1521
01:58:56,896 --> 01:58:58,966
To reduce the
distance between us,

1522
01:58:59,499 --> 01:59:00,340
To reduce it?

1523
01:59:01,134 --> 01:59:02,499
Shall I call you Laletta?

1524
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,987
You should call me
that only from now on.

1525
01:59:09,509 --> 01:59:10,328
Only you!

1526
01:59:12,245 --> 01:59:13,086
Car!

1527
01:59:13,713 --> 01:59:15,135
The car is here.

1528
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:17,047
Sreekkutta, sorry.

1529
01:59:17,617 --> 01:59:18,982
The boys made a mistake.

1530
01:59:19,385 --> 01:59:20,716
They are really punctual.

1531
01:59:23,856 --> 01:59:25,221
Shall I?
- Please.

1532
01:59:27,693 --> 01:59:28,534
Okay.

1533
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:30,989
Gautham..
- Sir..

1534
01:59:31,497 --> 01:59:33,067
You're having food on time, right?

1535
01:59:35,968 --> 01:59:36,809
Shall I go?

1536
01:59:57,423 --> 01:59:58,264
How did you?

1537
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:13,046
Sir..

1538
02:00:13,506 --> 02:00:14,734
What did you cook up?

1539
02:00:16,943 --> 02:00:17,784
Sir?

1540
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:20,285
He must have cried and fallen at
his feet, to release the car.

1541
02:00:22,415 --> 02:00:23,256
You did great.

1542
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:24,490
Really shocked us.

1543
02:00:24,817 --> 02:00:25,658
I swear.

1544
02:00:25,851 --> 02:00:27,580
Well, what next?

1545
02:00:28,421 --> 02:00:29,262
What next?

1546
02:00:32,024 --> 02:00:33,423
I can't take up any more tensions.

1547
02:00:34,327 --> 02:00:36,340
As soon as possible, do whatever
you want with this money.

1548
02:00:37,296 --> 02:00:38,399
What about the place?

1549
02:00:39,999 --> 02:00:42,160
Shahjahan sir said he knows
a safe place, right?

1550
02:00:42,702 --> 02:00:43,543
That place is fine.

1551
02:00:44,704 --> 02:00:46,251
Venu, you drive.
I can't drive anymore.

1552
02:01:10,296 --> 02:01:11,137
Oh my God!

1553
02:01:11,597 --> 02:01:13,235
Sir, which is this place?

1554
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:14,674
How is it?

1555
02:01:14,867 --> 02:01:16,437
We just want to things
to get done, right Venu?

1556
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:17,677
But sir..

1557
02:01:18,004 --> 02:01:20,017
full option Evalia car
will cost 13 lakhs.

1558
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,181
Jaison..

1559
02:01:22,475 --> 02:01:23,521
then we needn't waste time now.

1560
02:01:23,743 --> 02:01:25,552
I'll take the bag.
- Correct. We shouldn't waste time.

1561
02:01:27,346 --> 02:01:28,540
All of you leave.

1562
02:01:29,582 --> 02:01:30,401
I didn't get you.

1563
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,841
Then what about the money?

1564
02:01:37,056 --> 02:01:39,217
What if! haven't intended to
give the money to any of you?

1565
02:01:40,359 --> 02:01:41,200
Then my car?

1566
02:01:41,427 --> 02:01:43,406
He isjustjoking.
He will give it.

1567
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:47,027
l was watching your play
all this while, sir.

1568
02:01:47,733 --> 02:01:48,745
Now let me play for some time.

1569
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:50,639
Jaison, don't create an issue.

1570
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:53,493
Finish this somehow. You can give
them my money if you want to.

1571
02:01:56,309 --> 02:01:57,446
Money for doing what?

1572
02:01:58,611 --> 02:01:59,896
And about finishing this somehow..

1573
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:05,591
Hey!

1574
02:02:05,885 --> 02:02:07,113
Are you looking forthis, kiddo?

1575
02:02:10,623 --> 02:02:13,194
However much you grow,
this is all you'll be.

1576
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:18,285
So shall we share
it peacefully now?

1577
02:02:25,638 --> 02:02:27,276
Sir, no.
- Leave me.

1578
02:02:27,606 --> 02:02:28,595
Sir, no.
- Leave me, I say!

1579
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:31,917
Sir, no.
- Leave me. No point talking to him!

1580
02:02:54,133 --> 02:02:55,418
Venu!

1581
02:03:50,022 --> 02:03:51,011
Sir..
-Come!

1582
02:04:17,616 --> 02:04:18,457
lkka.

1583
02:05:40,866 --> 02:05:41,707
Get lost!
- Jaison!

1584
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:31,656
lkka wasn't able
to foresee this.

1585
02:06:36,689 --> 02:06:39,340
When a girl starts loving someone,

1586
02:06:39,825 --> 02:06:43,249
even God might not be able to foresee
what all she would do for him.

1587
02:06:45,731 --> 02:06:46,982
What you did today..

1588
02:07:15,661 --> 02:07:16,992
Who else wants money?

1589
02:07:20,766 --> 02:07:21,869
Sir..

1590
02:07:22,201 --> 02:07:24,385
Jaison, he got pushed
into this because of me.

1591
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:25,911
Kill me.

1592
02:07:26,372 --> 02:07:27,703
Leave him alone.

1593
02:07:31,944 --> 02:07:33,673
What a man you are, sir.

1594
02:07:47,426 --> 02:07:48,267
But sir,

1595
02:07:49,228 --> 02:07:51,332
there's an old debt that's yet
to be settled between us.

1596
02:07:52,164 --> 02:07:54,405
I'll bring the mobile's
price to your shop.

1597
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:55,674
No.

1598
02:08:00,706 --> 02:08:01,547
No.

1599
02:08:07,813 --> 02:08:08,654
Shall I go?

1600
02:08:09,481 --> 02:08:10,322
Sir..

1601
02:08:17,790 --> 02:08:18,631
Sir..

1602
02:08:23,896 --> 02:08:24,965
My car!

1603
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:30,448
No sir. It's over. Let's leave
before someone comes here.

1604
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:33,083
But Venu..
- Sir, come. Listen to me, please.

1605
02:08:34,206 --> 02:08:35,685
Let's leave from here.
Come, sir.

1606
02:08:38,277 --> 02:08:39,562
Come.
Walk.

1607
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:52,654
What to do, sir.

1608
02:08:52,925 --> 02:08:54,028
That car was all I had.

1609
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:56,625
l have no idea what to do.

1610
02:08:57,062 --> 02:08:59,451
lam heartbroken, sir.

1611
02:09:00,833 --> 02:09:03,722
Even if! have to sell my house, I'll see
to it that your family doesn't starve.

1612
02:09:04,436 --> 02:09:05,721
Are you sure?
- Sure.

1613
02:09:08,941 --> 02:09:10,976
Sir..

1614
02:09:10,976 --> 02:09:11,817
My..
-Venu!

1615
02:09:15,314 --> 02:09:16,622
Sir, my car!

1616
02:09:18,083 --> 02:09:20,825
Maybe God might have made them leave
it here, because of your good heart.

1617
02:09:25,491 --> 02:09:26,332
What is it, Venu?

1618
02:09:26,759 --> 02:09:29,000
l was looking if they left some
money, because of my good heart.

1619
02:09:31,196 --> 02:09:32,037
Or no need.

1620
02:09:46,345 --> 02:09:50,315
There have been several moments when all
the ways were closed, in our lives.

1621
02:09:51,784 --> 02:09:55,288
When times are bad, thefirst thing we
think about to survive, is a short cut.

1622
02:09:56,789 --> 02:10:00,088
But the lives of any such people, haven't
progressed rightfully thereafter.

1623
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,264
All of us have situations where
we're in dire need of money.

1624
02:10:25,384 --> 02:10:28,420
And during all those situations,
we have overcome it,

1625
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:29,933
with help from someone
orthe other.

1626
02:10:31,623 --> 02:10:33,602
l have heard some wise
man saying long back;

1627
02:10:34,426 --> 02:10:39,284
that he has never seen someone who's greedy
of money, smiling with all his heart.

1628
02:10:43,035 --> 02:10:45,105
During this race to achieve
a whole lot of things,

1629
02:10:48,273 --> 02:10:49,410
just turn around.

1630
02:10:50,242 --> 02:10:58,183
We have everything there.

1631
02:10:58,183 --> 02:11:00,959
If you're ready to even take
the lives ofour own kind;

1632
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:04,125
the punishment that they
deserve, is really gruesome.

1633
02:12:04,283 --> 02:12:06,057
Will this be enough for
you to buy those cars?

1634
02:12:10,088 --> 02:12:10,986
Sir, where is this from?

1635
02:13:18,256 --> 02:13:19,177
I had called Harish.

1636
02:13:19,725 --> 02:13:21,204
He has confirmed the
ticket and Visa.

1637
02:13:22,394 --> 02:13:23,998
He said he will transfer
the cash as well.

1638
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:26,085
We'll lose some money.

1639
02:13:26,431 --> 02:13:27,272
But that is safer.

1640
02:13:27,532 --> 02:13:29,267
So when will come
& get the money?

1641
02:13:29,267 --> 02:13:30,268
Tonight.

1642
02:13:30,268 --> 02:13:32,316
We have to give it to him
before leaving to the airport?

1643
02:13:32,671 --> 02:13:34,775
The Toronto flight is from
Mumbai, day after evening.

1644
02:13:36,608 --> 02:13:38,917
After 2 more days, Jaison and
Sherin will be in Canada.

1645
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:56,415
Don't stand here.
Leave.

1646
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:58,394
You can't sit here.
Come on, leave.

1647
02:14:09,674 --> 02:14:10,515
Did you see the baby?

1648
02:14:10,842 --> 02:14:11,683
Hello..

1649
02:14:19,451 --> 02:14:20,645
Do you want to go to jail?

1650
02:14:58,723 --> 02:14:59,974
Take good care of it.

1651
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:02,381
Okay.

1652
02:15:11,303 --> 02:15:12,588
Suresh, my dear..
- Uncle..

1653
02:15:13,138 --> 02:15:14,867
Now you can go on tours
wherever you want.

1654
02:15:16,875 --> 02:15:18,012
Sorry Papa..
- Son,

1655
02:15:18,543 --> 02:15:19,646
it's all good.

1656
02:15:20,112 --> 02:15:22,251
But will only kids come here because
of all this shots and noise?

1657
02:15:22,647 --> 02:15:23,955
No. Families will also come.

1658
02:15:24,249 --> 02:15:25,648
Are you sure?
- Sure!

1659
02:15:28,386 --> 02:15:30,115
Please taste this, sir.

1660
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:38,036
It's great, Sreekutta.

1661
02:15:40,398 --> 02:15:41,535
Huh?
- Chicken A La Kiev.

1662
02:15:42,501 --> 02:15:45,137
This is like a Renji
Panicker movie dialogue.

1663
02:15:45,137 --> 02:15:46,866
Change that name, or else
people will get scared.

1664
02:15:49,141 --> 02:15:50,506
Now everything is in
your hands, Sree.

1665
02:15:52,611 --> 02:15:53,452
Rock it, partner!

1666
02:15:53,712 --> 02:15:55,020
We will rock, Laletta!

1667
02:15:57,415 --> 02:15:58,461
My stomach is full.

1668
02:15:58,717 --> 02:15:59,558
Then no need.

1669
02:16:00,285 --> 02:16:01,388
All the best.
- Okay.

1670
02:16:37,455 --> 02:16:38,376
Everything is okay, right?

1671
02:16:39,858 --> 02:16:41,086
We can improve only then.

1672
02:16:41,459 --> 02:16:42,619
I'll get you some desserts, okay?

1673
02:16:42,961 --> 02:16:45,297
Chef, serve some desserts for them.

1674
02:16:45,297 --> 02:16:46,548
I'm going to the
room for 10 minutes.

1675
02:16:50,335 --> 02:16:51,176
Thank you.

1676
02:17:01,279 --> 02:17:02,120
Yes dear..

1677
02:17:03,582 --> 02:17:04,503
Is she sleeping?

1678
02:17:07,919 --> 02:17:08,760
No.

1679
02:17:09,454 --> 02:17:10,443
ljust had lunch, dear.

1680
02:17:10,689 --> 02:17:11,530
There's a good rush.

1681
02:17:13,024 --> 02:17:13,865
Let me see.

1682
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,301
I'll try not to be late.

1683
02:17:17,696 --> 02:17:19,152
I'll call after
resting for a while.

1684
02:17:26,304 --> 02:17:27,464
This has been going
on for many days.

1685
02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:18,733
'We'll make everything okay.
Don't worry'

1686
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:23,871
'Don't think and calculate too
much, and stress your head now'

1687
02:18:24,696 --> 02:18:29,110
'Even if rain and
thunderstorms come this way,

1688
02:18:29,868 --> 02:18:34,896
let'sjust smile, hold an umbrella with
that smile, sing a happy song and go'

1689
02:18:36,441 --> 02:18:40,184
'To energize your cold mind, buddy;

1690
02:18:40,812 --> 02:18:45,317
have a nice hot tea
in a glass cup'

1691
02:18:46,084 --> 02:18:50,771
'Throw away that blanket
of laziness, my friend'

1692
02:19:17,449 --> 02:19:21,545
'The fire that you lit,
didn't light a cigarette'

1693
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:27,182
'lt lit an idea that was
waiting or a spark'

1694
02:19:27,892 --> 02:19:32,226
'Don't desire to completely
alter your destiny'

1695
02:19:32,897 --> 02:19:38,470
'Don't think about what flew away in the
wind, and what was thrown to the river’

1696
02:19:38,470 --> 02:19:42,179
'You need just a spark of a dream'

1697
02:19:42,907 --> 02:19:47,765
'To awaken, rise high, and live happily'

1698
02:19:49,647 --> 02:19:53,356
'Wear a smile that shocks
darkness, my friend'

1699
02:19:53,952 --> 02:19:58,457
'Don't get fed up and give up,
you always need desire'

1700
02:19:59,157 --> 02:20:03,810
'Rip apart the web that trapped you,
and fly high in the sky, myfriend'
