1
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,164
Listen, what happened?!

2
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,394
Uncle, riots have started.
Run! Run for your life!

3
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,941
Sir, some people threw
stones on..

4
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,505
..A temple and some
on the mosque.

5
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,747
And the riots started.

6
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,747
No decent man throws stones
on a temple or a mosque.

7
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,045
Some miscreants are trying
to harm our country.

8
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,317
Cordon off the entire
area. -Okay, sir!

9
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,422
Everybody go inside! Go inside!

10
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,091
Grandmother!

11
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,135
Constable, take her with
you quickly! -Yes, sir!

12
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,415
Stop rascals!

13
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,481
Tell me! Tell me who
has sent you?

14
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,393
You'll not open your mouth?!

15
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,759
I know very well how
to make you talk.

16
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,526
You'll be compelled to talk!

17
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,066
My name is Inspector Amar!

18
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,203
Who is behind all this unrest?!

19
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,177
Jagan!

20
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,411
Not Jagan.

21
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,077
But Jagannath Prasad!

22
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:34,114
The lord of this world and
the sky has sent me..

23
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,018
..As his gift to serve the
people of this world

24
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,089
'If someone's heart is broken,
this poor soul is pained.”

25
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,591
'The entire world's pain
is in my heart.”

26
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,567
By the way are you enjoying
the party or not?

27
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,030
Very much! Very much, Mr. Jagan.

28
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,210
You light even the darkness.

29
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,204
And it's not possible that your
party is not enjoyable.

30
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,475
Mr. Jagan, what's the happy
occasion for the party?

31
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,209
Why only happy? I throw a
party even when I am sad.

32
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,386
'I appreciate and
celebrate pain.”

33
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,385
'I want to lose myself
in gaiety always.”

34
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,254
What's this nonsense?!

35
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,668
Jagannath, the din you love

36
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,128
it is a sample of that.

37
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,917
Can you see the wounds
of these poor people?

38
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,420
This log belongs to their
burnt down houses.

39
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,484
You burnt their houses to
lighten up capitalist world.

40
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,987
Asshole?! -You murderer! Do
not act innocent.

41
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,701
I am happy that for the
first time somebody..

42
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,495
..Dared to catch Jagannath
by his collar.

43
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,304
Dared to raise his voice
in front of him.

44
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,599
I've not only raised my voice

45
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,070
but I'll make your life
so miserable..

46
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,109
..That you won't think
of taking rebirth.

47
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,678
Come with me!

48
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,115
You please continue partying.
I'll be back soon.

49
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,220
Sir

50
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,755
I'll fill your pockets to
the brim with money.

51
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:26,127
Mr. Jagannat should be out of
the jail within an hour.

52
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,072
You'll get whatever amount you
want for this one hour.

53
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,906
Alright! I'll do your work
right now. -Thank you.

54
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,689
Mr. Jagannath.. -Yes?

55
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,624
A social worker like you was
arrested by the police.

56
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,951
What's the reason for it?

57
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,991
Not the police but an
insane inspector did.

58
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,136
He wants to defame
the respectable

59
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,571
and gain fame for himself
instantly.

60
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,541
Would you like to give a message
to such police officers?

61
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,209
Yes!

62
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,481
If these officers can
harass us then

63
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,942
they must be troubling
the poor..

64
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,451
..A lot. You please
mention that.

65
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,449
Sir, one more.. -No,
that's enough.

66
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:18,954
This much is sufficient.
There is..

67
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,456
..No need to ask anything more.

68
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,912
Sir, I had arrested Jagan
with great difficulty.

69
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,971
.And you just let him go?

70
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,409
What else could I've done?

71
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,483
Without any witness, proof or..

72
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,522
..Crime, how could I've
locked him in the cell?

73
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,721
What? There was no witness?

74
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,386
What about that Manglu whom
I'd nabbed rioting?

75
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,364
He was ready to testify.

76
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,693
Was his statement not
enough for you?

77
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,597
I am sorry, Amar.

78
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,636
I am helpless.

79
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,268
If officers like you are
helpless then officers like us..

80
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,672
..Should be considered dead.

81
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,211
We are lifeless puppets

82
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,445
on whom these uniforms
are hanging.

83
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,951
You are not helpless, sir.

84
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,589
You are rendered helpless.

85
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,958
When there is pressure
from above..

86
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,015
..Then one has to
be pressurized.

87
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,426
You have to keep mum and open
the lock ups. -Amar!

88
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,694
Sir, this uniform is useless
if it can not safe guard..

89
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,298
..The innocent against crime.

90
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,267
What use is this post

91
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,368
which can not even arrest
a rich criminal?

92
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,904
If by mistake we arrest them
then with the help of..

93
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,039
..Money they go Scot-free.

94
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,913
Sir, to become helpless
everyday.

95
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,612
Killing own self-respect
might be okay for you.

96
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,182
But I can not bear all this.

97
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,652
I am born to die only once

98
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,023
and not again and again.

99
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,257
By evening my resignation
will reach you.

100
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,492
So, brother Jagannath.

101
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,103
Your work is done.

102
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,964
You went to jail and
came out too.

103
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,473
But I did not let the breeze of
the lock up even touch you.

104
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,976
If you start favoring me then
my life will become heaven.

105
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,648
Thank you very much. Thank you!

106
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,084
Brother Jagan, why
are you so silent?

107
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,456
Mr. Champaklal,

108
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,167
I think I was a snake
in my past birth.

109
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,163
A snake does not sit idle
until it bites the man

110
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,599
who has harmed him.

111
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:57,670
In the same way until I do not
torture and kill my enemy..

112
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,150
.. keep seething inside me.

113
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,111
I'll not leave that
rascal Amar alive.

114
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,280
Relax! Relax!

115
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,525
Brother Jagan, even by mistake
do not take a hasty step.

116
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,591
I've with great difficulty
pacified the higher authorities.

117
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,192
No Mr. Chamoaklal.

118
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,266
He has insulted me publicly.

119
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,603
For the same reason I had killed
my father then who is he?

120
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,134
Relax! Relax!

121
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:31,078
Mr. Jagan, for some time
please cool down.

122
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,247
Please.

123
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,382
Let people forget
his case first.

124
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,553
Then you can take your revenge
at leisure. I am here.

125
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,135
I will not let this happen.

126
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:31,038
According to Shera's demand if
his 25 men are not released..

127
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,972
..Then he will kill all the
bus passengers one by one.

128
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,236
If we release those dangerous
men then..

129
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,183
..Who knows how many more
people they'll kill.

130
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,251
Why don't you allow us to meet
them? Please let us meet them.

131
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,621
Please let us go in.
- Yes, let us go in.

132
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,218
Listen please. I understand
your sentiments.

133
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,189
And I also know that in such
circumstances not only you..

134
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,365
..But no one in this world
will keep silent.

135
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,471
But what have you done to
catch those dacoits?

136
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,598
We'll not leave any stone
unturned to save your relatives.

137
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,306
But we will not keep silent
with your empty promises.

138
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,448
Screaming and yelling will
not serve any purpose.

139
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,745
I appeal to you all that
you all help us.

140
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,348
I promise that

141
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,314
very soon all the bus passengers
will be saved..

142
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,220
..And reach their homes.

143
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:30,592
Shera has announced that if his
25 men are not released..

144
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,995
..Then he will kill all the
bus passengers one by one.

145
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,596
Wonderful! What a threat!

146
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,244
The job of shaking the
government which even seasoned..

147
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,175
"Politicians couldn't
do, Shera has done.

148
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,341
And this plan was not hatched
by Shera alone.

149
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,213
I too was involved in this. -Oh!

150
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,216
It was my brains and
Shera's brawn.

151
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,047
Well yes, of course.

152
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,388
Many bow to your intelligence,
no doubt.

153
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:01,124
Now you'll see how this
government sinks like a boat.

154
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,692
Here a child and a
woman is killed,

155
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,229
there the government
will get nervous

156
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,598
and immediately release
those 25 criminals.

157
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,703
But Mr. Jagan, what will you
do with those 25 criminals?

158
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:15,004
Murders, riots, unrest!

159
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,979
I'll send those criminals
to every..

160
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,014
..Nook and corner
of this country.

161
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:23,079
There they'll create so many
communal and political riots..

162
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,188
..That this government
will be badly shaken.

163
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,116
Mr. Jagan, please do not create
riots at such a large scale.

164
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,124
I fear that its heat
might scorch us too.

165
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,723
We don't get scorched is the
reason that I have hired you.

166
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:42,405
I'll keep lighting the fire and
you keep dousing it. OK?

167
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,316
I've been waiting for
you for a long time.

168
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,756
You were waiting for me? Tell
me what's the matter?

169
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,423
Please sit inside.
I'll tell you.

170
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,723
I should si.. sit?! -Don't fear.
I will not kidnap you.

171
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,463
I am not afraid of any one. Look
I sat down. Now tell me.

172
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,104
Where do we have to go?

173
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,582
Mr. Dayal!

174
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,688
Amar

175
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,521
by uprooting the dacoit
Shera from this area..

176
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,187
..You've proved your bravery.

177
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,432
Sir, dacoit Shera is not
completely uprooted yet.

178
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,930
Because Shera is not
only a dacoit..

179
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,370
..But a very big terrorist also.

180
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:50,931
And you know very well
that behind..

181
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,566
..Every terrorist
there is always..

182
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,144
..Some big personality.

183
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,514
Now first of all I'll have
to maim that personality.

184
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,577
Do you suspect someone?
- I do, sir.

185
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,120
But I don't have any proof.

186
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,190
Who is he? -Mr. Jagan.

187
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,421
Mr. Jagan?! -He is
very rich, right?

188
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,957
That's why he has buried
his crimes..

189
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,693
..Under the rug of his riches.

190
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,961
I am confident that
one day you'll..

191
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,403
..Definitely find proof
against him.

192
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,502
I need your good wishes,
sir. -All the best.

193
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,667
Thank you, sir.

194
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,471
Crush him.

195
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,549
Amar!

196
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,591
Amar! -Yes!

197
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,491
What are you thinking? -I..

198
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:58,673
I am thinking that you lost
your legs to save me.

199
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:04,209
And walking on the path of truth
I too lost my uniform.

200
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,283
The end result? Nothing!

201
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,483
The crime is still alive and
the criminals too are alive.

202
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,155
That's the reason I've
called you here.

203
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:21,055
You just have to order. I can
stake my life for you.

204
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,030
Amar,

205
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,070
my grand daughter..

206
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,277
Mr. Dayal, what are
you trying to say?

207
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,341
What.. what happened to
your grand daughter?

208
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,240
I'll tell you, Mr. Amar.

209
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,575
Seema was going by
bus to Bangalore..

210
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,278
..To attend a friend's wedding.

211
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,916
The dacoits attacked the bus

212
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,615
and took all the passengers
as hostages.

213
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,420
Hostages? Who did this? -Shera!

214
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,322
Dacoit Shera?! -Yes, dear.

215
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,230
You know that he is an
old enemy of mine.

216
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,334
If he comes to know that Seema
is my grand daughter..

217
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,672
..Then who knows how
he'll treat her.

218
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:14,542
Son, this old man begs you for
his grand daughter's life.

219
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,983
Mr. Dayal, what.. what
are you doing?!

220
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,051
Please.. please do
not embarrass me.

221
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,693
You have always loved me more
than your own children.

222
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,758
You gave me education
and raised me.

223
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,122
Got me the job in the
Police department.

224
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:34,062
And that day you put your life
at stake and saved me.

225
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,563
My every breath is
indebted to you.

226
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,038
You just have to order
me, Mr. Dayal.

227
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,340
I will lay down my life
and save Seema..

228
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,415
..From the clutches
of those devils.

229
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:51,945
Mr. Dayal, please have faith
in me. Yes, I'll go.

230
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,245
I'll definitely go.

231
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,996
What happened, uncle?

232
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,506
I am remembering my children

233
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,546
I don't know how they must be.

234
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,048
They do not have anyone in
this world except me.

235
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,653
Have patience, uncle. Everything
will be alright.

236
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,622
And my grand father Mr. Dayal
was a police commissioner.

237
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,457
Between him and this dacoit
there is a very old animosity.

238
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,398
When he comes to know that the
dacoits have kidnapped..

239
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,130
..His grand daughter then he
will definitely do something.

240
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,596
Really, dear. -Yes, uncle.

241
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,601
But I am his grand daughter,
no one should know this.

242
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,482
Greetings! -Bless you, dear!

243
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,542
Tell me, how come you are here?
ls everything alright?

244
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,213
Uncle Rahim, when I
was in the police

245
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,919
you helped me a lot
by giving me..

246
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,119
..The addresses of
the criminals.

247
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,325
Today I'm facing a difficult
test. I need your help.

248
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,558
Just order me, dear.

249
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,592
I need Kasim Ali and
Karan's whereabouts.

250
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,063
I do not know anything
about Karan.

251
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,236
But where would be
Kasim Ali, I know.

252
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,376
Where will he be right now?

253
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,052
So, Mungilal the cheat!

254
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:46,001
My name is Kasim Ali Barkat Ali
Shamsher Bahadur Nawab Topchi.

255
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,969
When I was in the military
these hands..

256
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,597
..Have fired so many bullets..

257
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,968
..That if I catch
hold of a fired..

258
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,374
..Bullet then it won't come out.

259
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,242
It will become a dud
inside my fist.

260
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,648
That is why I am telling you
that never try to cheat..

261
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,378
..Kasim Ali Barkat Ali again.

262
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,084
Nor try to take out the
cards from your sleeve.

263
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,989
Or when you'll go home
you won't have..

264
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,358
..Your hand neither the sleeve.

265
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,157
Got it? -Got it!

266
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:19,100
Now run with your tail between
your legs, scoundrel.

267
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,733
Come on, let's start playing.

268
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,769
I bet 300 rupees.

269
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,578
300 mine too.

270
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,447
First put the money.

271
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,449
You are a very suspicious man.

272
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,284
If you die you won't
get a shroud too

273
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,354
Your wife will wrap you
in a rag and bury you.

274
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,989
This is a ring worth
1000 rupees.

275
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,758
I am betting 300 out of it.
Come on, show! Wait!

276
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,500
You want to touch the ring of
Kasim Ali Barkat Ali Jung..

277
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,299
..Bahadur Nawab Topchi?

278
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,340
When I said that it is worth a
1000 then it is worth a 1000.

279
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:57,974
Even now if you've
not understood..

280
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,600
..Should I make you understand?

281
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,735
No, I've understood.
Got it! -Okay! Show!

282
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,516
Jack, queen and king!

283
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,153
Wait! I'll beat you to
pulp if you touch it.

284
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,283
First let me see
my cards. Idiot!

285
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,719
Jack, queen and king!

286
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,658
Oh! Jack, queen and king!

287
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,256
Now tell me, what is this?

288
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,636
Ace, King and Queen!

289
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,163
You are dumb founded, right?

290
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,473
The idiot was touching
Kasil Ali's ring.

291
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:36,069
Kasim Ali Barkat Ali Jung
Bahadur Nawab Topchi will go now.

292
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:36,942
God bless!

293
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,949
Now Hasan, you'll not have any
complaint with your father.

294
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,144
Both father and son will enjoy
to our hearts fullest.

295
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,191
Brother Kasim! -Who is it?!

296
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,758
Kasim.. brother Kasim!

297
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,965
Why are you panting?
Why are you taking..

298
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,501
..So long to call out my name?

299
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,967
Tell me quickly what's the
matter? -it's good..

300
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,197
..Brother Kasim, that
you met me here.

301
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,337
I have been searching
for you everywhere.

302
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,203
Tell me, do you want to beat
me? ls everything alright?

303
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,237
Everything is not alright,
brother Kasim.

304
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,976
You know well that
when ever I am..

305
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,708
..In need of money
I come to you.

306
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,210
Have you come to ask
for something?

307
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,539
Tell me what is the matter?

308
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,745
Today.. today do not refuse me.

309
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,517
I am in dire need of money.

310
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,987
Now tell me what happened
to the..

311
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,581
..Money I gave you
the other day?

312
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,458
Brother Kasim.. -Yes?

313
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,326
It was spent for my
son's medicines.

314
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,430
Brother Kasim, today my son
has become critical.

315
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,032
The doctor says that he'll
have to be operated upon.

316
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:42,179
I went to many people for help
but I did not get any money.

317
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,709
Now you are my only hope.

318
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,348
Please save my child,
brother Kasim.

319
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,276
Save my child. Otherwise
he'll die.

320
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:55,055
For the sake of god,
save my child.

321
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,554
Save my child, brother
Kasim. Save my child..

322
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,633
Thank you very much,
brother Kasim.

323
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,365
Thank you very much,
brother Kasim.

324
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,461
Thank you very much.

325
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,638
God that's your will.

326
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,243
My daddy has come!

327
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:29,550
Mummy, we are going for a
picnic! -Yes, we are also going!

328
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,065
Greetings, sir! Greetings..

329
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,069
Are you angry? -Because of you.

330
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,548
You are not very concerned
about my anger.

331
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,945
Oh my son, for your
one smile your..

332
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,075
..Father Kasim Ali
Barkat Ali Jung..

333
00:22:55,173 --> 00:23:00,088
..Bahadur Shamsher Nawab Topchi
can even lay down his life.

334
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,418
Then why are you late?

335
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,215
Son, what can I tell you.

336
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,953
The day I was born
I think all the..

337
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,122
"Watches of the
world were late.

338
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,291
That's why I think none of
my work is done on time.

339
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,298
Nor do I come to pick you
up at the right time.

340
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,995
Nor do I take you out on time.

341
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,571
Nor does my good time
start on time.

342
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,536
But do not fear, dear.

343
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,107
One day our days will change
for the better.

344
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,608
Allah will repay the debt of
our bad days just like that.

345
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,505
At least smile now, dear. -Why?

346
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,478
Silence!

347
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,448
Dad! -Yeas, dear.

348
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,516
This time we will go
on holiday, right?

349
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,058
Yes.. We had made
the program but..

350
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,556
No ifs and buts.

351
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
Dad, you had promised
that this time..

352
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,026
..We'll surely go on a holiday.

353
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:50,003
Yes, I had promised. I remember
that very well. But..

354
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,507
Again but? But what?

355
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,612
This time too the same money
problem has cropped in?

356
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,937
Every year I dream
that the moment..

357
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,381
..My vacations start I'll go..

358
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,312
..On a holiday with my dad.

359
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,946
What can I do, dear?
Like every time..

360
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,491
..This time tool
am embarrassed.

361
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,754
I mean to say.. look at my hand.

362
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,686
There is no money
line in it. Look!

363
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,987
Look there is nothing.

364
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,163
The money comes. Stays in
my hand for a while.

365
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,958
But then it just slips away.

366
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,028
Dad! -Yes..

367
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,169
Why don't you work like other
children's fathers?

368
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,477
What can I do, son? What work?

369
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,276
Earlier I was in the military.

370
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,080
I had to leave it because
of your mother's illness.

371
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,084
You were very small then.

372
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,687
I was all alone.

373
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,487
And we did not have
any relatives too.

374
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,102
I tried very hard but
I couldn't save her.

375
00:24:55,527 --> 00:25:00,738
Fate took her away. And you
were left alone with me.

376
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,942
That is why I do all
kinds of legal..

377
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,644
..And illegal jobs
to earn money.

378
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,210
So that my child is not
lacking anything.

379
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,712
Dad! -Yes!

380
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:15,717
Take this.

381
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,394
From where did you get
all this money?

382
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,628
I save everyday from
my pocket money.

383
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,030
I know that you go through
lot of trouble for me.

384
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,098
Then how can I waste your money?

385
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,104
Oh Allah! Oh Allah!

386
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,978
Lord, do not let this sinner
to stoop to such a level..

387
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,137
..That he is compelled to beg
from his innocent child.

388
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,272
Who has come?

389
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,183
Who has come between father
and his son at this time?

390
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,450
I'll just go and see.

391
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,146
Now who is at the.. Oh
Inspector, I'm sorry!

392
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,725
By lord I've not done anything.

393
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,553
But now you no more an inspector
then why do I fear you?

394
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,456
Pardon me, I take back
my nervousness.

395
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,132
Greetings! -Greetings!

396
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,533
Greetings, uncle! -Greetings!

397
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,168
Who is he? -A very sweet boy!
After all he is my son.

398
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,937
Oh! -Nawab Hasan Ali Shamsher
Ali Mohammad..

399
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,001
..Ali Ghulam Ali Nazakat
Ali Kali Topchi.

400
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,647
Dear Hasan, do you go to
school? -Yes, uncle.

401
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,512
Very good! Very good!

402
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,979
You do one thing.

403
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,382
Take this and go and
have an ice-cream.

404
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,285
No, Thank you. You want to talk
to dad so I'll go anyway.

405
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,495
The boy is very self-respected.

406
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,127
Okay, now tell me?

407
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,036
Do you want to earn
1 lac rupees?

408
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,607
1.. lac?! -Yes!

409
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,270
But the work is a little
dangerous. -The work sh..

410
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,437
Not bad words!

411
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,312
For 1 lac I can topple the
entire city, brother.

412
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,615
I do not want to open
a butcher's shop.

413
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,385
Listen to carefully what
work you've to do.

414
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,925
I am telling you there
is no need to..

415
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,053
..Listen or tell.
I swear, brother.

416
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,252
Now tell me when I have
to go to work. Tell me!

417
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,963
Listen, I'll need one more
boy for this work.

418
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,294
Who? -Karan!

419
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:13,539
You mean that monkey man Karan,
who looks like a foreigner.

420
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,270
But is a master thug.

421
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:15,936
Okay, call him. Call
him. I do not..

422
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,708
..Have any objection, brother.

423
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:22,117
But remember one thing.
The boy is over smart.

424
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,421
Since the morning till evening
he is only after..

425
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,680
Miss. Meena? -yes!

426
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,013
Have you got the packet? -Yes.

427
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,384
Then give it to me quickly.

428
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,424
I am giving, Miss. Meena.
I am giving.

429
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,045
What happened, Miss. Meena?!

430
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,318
What happened?!

431
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,523
Miss. Meena, what happened?
Miss. Meena?!

432
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,412
What is it?

433
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,079
Until now the packets which I
had delivered for you were..

434
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,358
..Containing Hashish,
heroin or opium.

435
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,995
But I never delivered
a parcel of death.

436
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:56,495
This is that packet which
contained the poisonous powder.

437
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:57,766
The moment Meena consumed
it she died.

438
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,137
In our business this
is common place.

439
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,670
It might be common occurrence
in your business, Dang.

440
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,580
But not in my business.

441
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:10,482
That girl breathed her
last in these arms.

442
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:16,488
And now I want to see you too
thrashing while dying.

443
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,596
Eat it!

444
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:13,140
No! No! No, Karan! No..

445
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:27,427
Dang, you'll be alive
for only 10 minutes.

446
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,295
And the hospital is only
5 minutes away.

447
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,206
If you can save yourself
then do it.

448
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,025
So you have returned?
Did you find him?

449
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,957
No, I looked into all
his dens but that..

450
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,001
..Monkey is nowhere to be found.

451
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,365
But I heard that he has killed
someone called Dang.

452
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,404
And Dang's men are after
him like sniffer dogs.

453
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:29,989
Stop!

454
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,204
You look down there.

455
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,481
You go that way. Come with me.

456
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,701
Rascals!

457
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:39,176
No, sir! 1 lac is okay. There's
a threat to our lives in it

458
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,247
But I've heard that even
death is scared..

459
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,578
..To go into the den
of dacoit Shera.

460
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,047
And what am I in comparison?
Sorry!

461
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,260
If there is any other
work then call me.

462
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,103
So, Monkey man.

463
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,199
You've started leering?

464
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:13,039
Who are you? -She is Neeta.
And he is Mr. Karan.

465
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,643
It is her younger sister whom
Shera has kidnapped.

466
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,959
'When elder one is so
beautiful then..

467
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,495
..How beautiful the
younger would be.”

468
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,898
I was thinking that
you are elder..

469
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,336
..To me and requesting
me so much.

470
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:41,103
Soto refuse is a bad thing.
It is misbehaviour.

471
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,914
So, I am ready to go
along with you.

472
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,413
I knew, Karan. You are
such a decent boy.

473
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,917
Kasim, did you hear that?
Now he won't..

474
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,180
..Take those 1 lac rupees also.

475
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,256
What?! -Eat banana,
dear. Eat banana.

476
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,489
Hasan dear, you are crying.

477
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,159
Brave children do not cry.

478
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,693
And I am going away
only for my son.

479
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,396
To earn a lot of money.

480
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,433
Lots and lots.

481
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,230
Then you'll see that our bad
days will go away forever.

482
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,306
After that we father and son
will always be together.

483
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,136
We'll go on holidays
in your vacation.

484
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,438
. Hill station and lot
of other places.

485
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,971
Really, dad? -Yes, my child.

486
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,450
Hasan! Come here.

487
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,120
Come.. what were you chatting
with your dad?

488
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,492
Uncle, my dad always
risks his life.

489
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,595
I'm very scared. You please
take care of him.

490
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,565
Silly boy, nobody can
harm that dad..

491
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,403
..Who has such a sweet son.

492
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,167
God is always there with him.

493
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,206
And you don't trust your uncle?

494
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,979
You do, don't you?

495
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,676
I'm there, if there's
anything wrong. Okay?

496
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,617
Go and play. Go.

497
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,099
Brother Amar, I feel hungry.
Let's eat in some restaurant.

498
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,579
There it's.. Phagware's
restaurant.

499
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,984
Phagware's restaurant. Great.

500
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,322
Look at that fatso eating
food. Hey, fatso.

501
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:21,153
We, the poor had never
reveal your secret.

502
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,170
Money, from sir's pocket..

503
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:34,375
Money, from sir's pocket
clinked and said..

504
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,746
What?

505
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,611
Neither prophet nor messenger..

506
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,088
..Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

507
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,489
Neither prophet nor messenger..

508
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,994
..Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

509
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,325
Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

510
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,525
Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

511
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,169
Neither prophet nor messenger..

512
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,329
..Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

513
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,699
Neither prophet nor messenger..

514
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,736
..Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

515
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:10,677
When I weighed everybody
on the scale..

516
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,051
..Everybody were silent but..

517
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,659
Everybody were silent but
my heart cried out.

518
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,056
What?

519
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,462
Neither rupee nor paisa..

520
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,793
..Prophet is biggest
in the world.

521
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,194
Neither rupee nor paisa..

522
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,464
..Prophet is biggest
in the world.

523
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,731
Neither prophet nor messenger..

524
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,203
..Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

525
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,539
Neither prophet nor messenger..

526
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,477
..Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

527
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:53,091
Priest and Mullah
both love money.

528
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:57,326
Priest and Mullah
both love money.

529
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,662
Donate money and earn virtues.

530
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,465
Allah loves donations.

531
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,970
Money has all the defects.

532
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:11,574
Somebody has lighted this
fire amongst us.

533
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:16,075
Money is the cause
of every clash.

534
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,520
It has made brothers fight.

535
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,389
You'll repent, buddy..

536
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:28,121
You'll repent, buddy.
Don't curse money.

537
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,429
You don't know money has
a strange history.

538
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,534
Strange history.

539
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,036
Forget brother..

540
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:41,500
Forget brother, you can buy
anything if you've money.

541
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,704
Neither rupee nor paisa..

542
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,141
..Prophet is biggest

Neither prophet nor messenger..

544
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,947
..Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

545
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,525
Money, woman and land..

546
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,263
..Are the three enemies
in this world.

547
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,141
Rich worry about income tax
and poor sleep in peace.

548
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:25,510
Nobody cares about what
color is the money.

549
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:30,419
Money is the master key.

550
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:34,428
It opens every lock.

551
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:39,466
Even the dark skin girl, if
rich, appears white to me.

552
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,160
Even the old woman
looks young..

553
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,239
..When adorned with jewelry.

554
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,966
Young"

555
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,040
If one has money..

556
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:52,740
Even the blind girl
is valued, if rich.

557
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,176
Neither rupee nor paisa..

558
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,377
..Prophet is biggest
in the world.

559
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,385
Neither prophet nor messenger..

..Money is the biggest
thing in the world.

561
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:29,682
Money makes us dance
to its tunes.

562
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,512
Money sings for us.

563
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:38,690
Everything is possible..

564
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,692
..If your pocket is full.

565
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,961
All the empty pocket
people are foolish.

566
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:47,933
They're foolish..

567
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,234
Even the intelligent one
is considered foolish.

568
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:52,363
They're foolish..

569
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,605
Money is saluted everywhere.

570
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:00,307
..Without which one
loses the respect.

571
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:05,649
Buddy, take money
as your need.

572
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,981
Accept that it creates trouble
if its increased beyond limit.

573
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:16,394
It's money's characteristic to
even cast spell on saints.

574
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,590
Neither prophet nor messenger..

575
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,100

Neither rupee nor paisa..

577
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,432
..Prophet is biggest
in the world.

578
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,531
Prophet is biggest
in the world.

579
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,577
Messenger is biggest
in the world.

580
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,106
Neither prophet nor messenger..

581
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,011
..Money is biggest
in the world.

582
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,448
Neither rupee nor paisa..

583
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,611
..Prophet is biggest
in the world.

584
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,711
Money is biggest in the world.

585
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,924
Prophet is biggest
in the world.

586
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,118
Money is biggest in the world.

587
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,491
Messenger is biggest
in the world.

588
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,591
This is Binapur. Shera has
spread terror in this area.

589
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,532
Now we must kill him
by hook or crook.

590
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,939
That means we've entered
in dacoits area?

591
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,540
Absolutely yes.

592
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,236
Now both of you, use your
eyes as binocular..

593
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,679
..And ears as transmitters.
Be alert.

594
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:34,375
She just avoided me
and not slapped me.

595
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,638
That means I've a chance.

596
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,345
Excuse me! -Yes.

597
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,715
Your good name? -What's
your concern?

598
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,216
I've come here to make a film.

599
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,689
For which I need a hot
and bold heroine.

600
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,031
Will you act in my
film? -Really?

601
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,998
Are you making a film? -Yes.

602
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,567
On love. On romance.

603
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,333
Story begins with you..

604
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,604
..And ends with you.

605
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,219
Tell me. Who's that man
with whom you were..

606
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,986
"Standing too close
and chatting.

607
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,560
He's a stranger. He said he's
here to make a film.

608
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,228
To make a film or take
advantage of you?

609
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,697
Bloody bitch.

610
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,701
Wrestler, hit her slowly.

611
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:41,366
She's a tender girl. She
may broke into pieces.

612
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,508
Who are you? -I'm
a fan of beauty.

613
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,105
And crazy after it. I can
claim for my Juliet..

614
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:49,479
..Being her Romeo.

615
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,181
C'mon, darling. Your love has
come to take you away.

616
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,201
C'mon, darling. Let's go.

617
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,599
Juliet.. my Juliet..

618
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,443
Thank you.

619
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,238
Leave me, buddy.

620
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,629
Hold his legs tight.

621
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,292
Amar! -Hello!

622
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,464
Amar! Amar, help me.

623
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:53,732
Not at all. You went without
my permission..

624
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,103
..And followed a girl.

625
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,512
What's this? Let me talk.

626
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,747
When you've invited
this trouble..

627
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,180
..Then.. Sorry.. face
it with smile.

628
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,152
But.. but..

629
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,024
Hey, let me complete.

630
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,503
Brother, shall we help
him? -Not at all.

631
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,470
He says I shouldn't
help you at all.

632
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,469
We must help a decent
man, right?

633
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,736
He says we must
help a decent..

634
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:46,693
So?

635
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:04,736
You've raised hand at
Shera's brother.

636
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,040
I won't spare you.

637
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,515
Amar! -Stop, Karan.

638
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,748
Amar, if he'd escape, how'll
we find Shera's whereabouts?

639
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,249
We'll come to know only
when he'd escape.

640
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:38,078
Who tried to awaken a lion?

641
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:48,588
Who's inviting his death
by killing my men?

642
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,262
How did Kundan get injured?

643
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,937
Where are the other three men?

644
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,603
Bhima!

645
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,603
Yes, chief.

646
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,612
Only Shera has the right..

647
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,941
..To injure or kill people
in his reign.

648
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,379
Then who dared to injure him?

649
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,250
Don't know, chief.

650
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:20,217
Kundan! Kundan! Answer
me who injured you?

651
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,657
Open your mouth. Speak
up, Kundan.

652
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,463
Check his wounds.

653
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,006
Wounds are very deep.

654
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,411
It'll take long time to heal.

655
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:54,995
Chief, he..

656
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,553
..He's your brother.

657
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:10,935
Sher Singh kills lame horse
and injured men.

658
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,173
No matter if he's his brother.

659
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,181
This had never happened before.

660
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:25,392
Police could never arrest
any of my man.

661
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:30,961
And today four of my men are
killed in single day?

662
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,902
Spread in the entire area.

663
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,902
Search in every nook and
corner of the hillock.

664
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,108
Whoever he's, bring him to me.

665
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:44,470
But alive.

666
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:50,042
. If he'll die, his secret
too will die with him.

667
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,714
Go.

668
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,717
Tell me. Where are those three?

669
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:27,715
I don't know. I don't know.

670
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,996
Run! Run!

671
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:50,270
Tell me who they were who
injured our men? Tell me.

672
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,714
Shera's den is on that hill.

673
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:05,053
Entirely guarded by his men.

674
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,562
If we take the front route his
men will shoot us right there..

675
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,427
"Because they've
latest weapons.

676
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:16,735
That means traitors are
supporting Shera.

677
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,398
What do we do now?

678
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:26,147
Look, we must use mind when we
feel we're physically weak.

679
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,014
Listen, Hasim! Karan, you
too listen to this.

680
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:34,283
We must find some other
route. C'mon.

681
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,306
Hey, Karan! Karan.

682
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,078
Brother Kasim, I'm feeling
very sleepy.

683
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:03,411
To hell with your sleep. Stupid
fool. Monkey brand.

684
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,486
Sometime, listen to some
important things too.

685
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,747
What's so important?

686
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,723
Listen, Shera has wealth
worth millions.

687
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:16,362
If we obtain that, we'll
be millionaires.

688
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,258
But how do we obtain that?

689
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,705
Monkey brand, it's very simple.

690
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,707
When we'll go to Shera's
den to release..

691
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,974
..Dayal's grand daughter, we'll
grab his entire wealth.

692
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,011
Stop! -No.

693
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,348
Anita?!

694
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,651
Anita, you and here
at this time?

695
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,550
I've come to save my sister.

696
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:49,685
I'll be with you until Seema is
released from Shera's clutch.

697
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:53,133
You think three of us will
fail to save her?

698
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:54,467
Are we useless?

699
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,727
You just go back.

700
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,535
Amar, you're too much.

701
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,500
Shera's men have spread
everywhere in the forest.

702
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,598
She's alone.

703
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,772
What if something
happens to her?

704
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,615
Okay. Let's go.

705
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,122
Bhima

706
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,427
today I feel like
being merciful.

707
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:28,233
I wish to grace somebody.
- I didn't get you.

708
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,541
I wish to release one
hostage today..

709
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:39,142
..So that he can happily
go back to his family.

710
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,612
Don't commit such
mistake, chief.

711
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,276
I'll definitely commit
this mistake, Bhima.

712
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:50,515
Just think. When that hostage
will return to his family..

713
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,388
..The family members
will be so happy.

714
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,484
They'll bless us.

715
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,460
Who's the most aged amongst you?

716
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:11,545
Don't feel scared. Today
Shera is in good mood.

717
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,509
Tell me who's the most
aged amongst you?

718
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:20,516
I wish to release him and send
him home today. Tell me.

719
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:25,551
I'm aged. -I'm aged. I'm aged.
- He's lying. I'm aged.

720
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:29,391
Chief, I'm aged. He's..
- Don't lie. I'm aged.

721
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:30,725
I'm the most aged. -Bhima.

722
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,589
You decide who's the
most aged from them.

723
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:43,605
Go, you're free. Go home.

724
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:51,175
Before I change my mind go away.

725
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:53,520
May God bless you.

726
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:57,249
May God bless you. -Enough.
Don't bless me.

727
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,158
I don't believe in God.

728
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,532
You're free. You just leave now.

729
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:10,067
Go. Go.. very good. Go.

730
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:30,455
Bhima!

731
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,281
Yes, chief.

732
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:36,019
How far that old man
must have reached?

733
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:39,433
Approximately a quarter mile, chief.

734
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,965
Bring the new one.

735
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,418
Wow! What an aim, chief!

736
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:09,355
It's very nice. Buy
one more dozen.

737
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,492
No, I don't want to die.

738
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,005
What happened? Who killed you?

739
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,344
Shera.

740
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:08,614
He frees helpless people..

741
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,652
..And then kills.

742
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:18,096
One by one he'll kill all
of them. All of them..

743
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:47,220
So many men have spread around
this hillock that it's not..

744
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:52,322
..Just difficult but it looks
impossible to kill that Shera.

745
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,025
What are you saying, Kasim?

746
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:55,927
How did you become so coward?

747
01:04:56,525 --> 01:05:01,941
We're the waves who have
crashed many big rocks.

748
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:03,307
Now that we're near to
our destination..

749
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,377
..You're talking of returning?

750
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,974
No, it's not that.

751
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,572
But the entire place is
full of dead ends.

752
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,282
Look, Kasim. We won't
go by that route.

753
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:16,282
In fact we'll take the backside
route through these hillocks.

754
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,590
This route is of course
dangerous.

755
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,985
But Shera's men who're
guarding here..

756
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,664
..Are much more dangerous
than this route.

757
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:28,293
They should not see us.
- I'll manage that.

758
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,308
No, Anita. it's dangerous.

759
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,111
So, I won't allow you
to take this risk.

760
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:45,378
You don't worry. Nothing
will happen to me.

761
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,120
Are you sure? -Sure.

762
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,648
Best of luck. -Thank you.

763
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:51,691
Anita,

764
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,088
it says when human is surrounded
by evil people..

765
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:56,925
..God helps human.

766
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,965
If you feel you're in
trouble remember Him.

767
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:03,503
He'll clear all your hurdles.

768
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,039
Take care.

769
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,203
Okay, Karan. Go ahead.

770
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:06,272
I've a news which will
definitely please your chief.

771
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,405
But I've a condition.
- What's that?

772
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:14,374
You must release me. -Okay.

773
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:35,728
Dayal's grand daughter?!

774
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,348
Bring her into my tent.

775
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:11,460
Grand daughter of Dayal
who ruined my reign.

776
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,634
I'll ruin you in such a way..

777
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,773
..That your grand father
will die with shame.

778
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:34,553
Leave me! Leave me!

779
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,657
Leave me! Where are
you taking me away?

780
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:42,031
Hey!

781
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,595
What's this noise for?

782
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,637
Bhima! Who's this girl?

783
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,746
Chief.. leave me..

784
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,147
Chief, I'm a nomadic girl.

785
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,351
I was passing from there..

786
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,315
..And your men caught me.

787
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:09,128
What do you do? -I'm a
professional dancer.

788
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:14,465
Chief, long time has passed
that we've enjoyed.

789
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,300
Okay.

790
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:22,432
My enemy Dayal's grand
daughter too..

791
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,670
..Will dance with
this nomad girl.

792
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,286
You can keep me locked..

793
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,255
..Or force me to take the veil.

794
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,624
You can keep me locked..

795
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,620
..Or force me to take the veil.

796
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:20,523
We've come to win
over your heart.

797
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,695
You can keep me locked..

798
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,768
..Or force me to take the veil.

799
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,276
You can keep me locked..

800
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:31,274
..Or force me to take the veil.

801
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:36,006
By swear of you.. -we
say this openly..

802
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:40,449
We're here to show
you our power.

803
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:44,615
You can keep me locked..

804
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,618
..Or force me to take the veil.

805
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,026
You can keep me locked..

806
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,162
..Or force me to take the veil.

807
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:18,516
Thieves started entering
into thieves' houses.

808
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:22,619
People started avoiding now.

809
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:27,161
Thieves started entering
into thieves' houses.

810
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:31,563
People started avoiding now.

811
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:35,904
Now even the lovers started
hiding their feelings.

812
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:40,077
Now even the lovers started
hiding their feelings.

813
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:44,715
Don't feel so scared.
- On your name..

814
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,045
We've come to offer our lives.

815
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,322
You can keep me locked..

816
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,189
..Or force me to take the veil.

817
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,453
You can keep me locked..

818
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,456
..Or force me to take the veil.

819
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:36,028
Don't teach me the
tricks of love.

820
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:40,331
Don't teach me the
tricks of love.

821
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,900
Don't teach me the ways
of deceit and betray.

822
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,142
You're destined to cry now.

823
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:53,413
You're destined to cry now.

824
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:55,647
Now your eyes will open up.

825
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:58,024
We'll rob all your wealth.

826
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:02,252
We've come to make you
lose your senses.

827
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,360
You can keep me locked..

828
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,366
..Or force me to take the veil.

829
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,726
You can keep me locked..

830
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:12,967
..Or force me to take the veil.

831
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:59,647
Bring your gun. Shoot us.

832
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:04,054
Bring your gun. Shoot us.

833
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:08,925
Damsel is present
in front of you.

834
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:15,261
We openly claim.. -whether
it's a sin or virtue.

835
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,629
Now we're impatient..

836
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,666
Whether it's a sin or virtue.

837
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,997
Now we're impatient..

838
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:25,977
We've come to end your reign.

839
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,310
You can keep me locked..

840
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,180
..Or force me to take the veil.

841
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:56,598
Shoot them.

842
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,616
Not just my grand daughter..

843
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,190
..But you've returned
a life of this house.

844
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,161
It's such a great favour to me

845
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:40,330
that I can't even repay it even
if I sacrifice my life.

846
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,930
Take this. As I had
promised.. here..

847
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,334
..You get one lac rupees each.

848
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,241
Monkey brand. Follow me.

849
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:53,542
Amar. -Dayal sir.

850
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,550
You've always favoured
me in life.

851
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,213
And today when I've come of
a little help to you..

852
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,321
..You're paying me against
it? Don't embarrass me.

853
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:16,659
Kasim! Karan! You've got
the reward as promised.

854
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,770
Return me the wealth that you
looted from Shera's den.

855
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:26,237
Shera's wealth? -One that's
filled in your bags.

856
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:28,305
Look, Amar.

857
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:32,148
We risked our lives to
obtain that wealth.

858
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,418
So, we've the right over it.

859
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,011
How?

860
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,590
Shera looted people.

861
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,490
And we looted it from Shera.

862
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,223
And the looted goods
if looted again..

863
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:44,661
..Nobody will have
the right over it.

864
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,991
Of course not. Government
has the right over it.

865
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:53,195
Brother Amar, stop these
legal advices.

866
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:54,963
Karan, follow me. -Stop!

867
01:23:57,966 --> 01:24:01,470
Kasim, before I forget
friendship..

868
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:05,608
..And come on to the Law,
return that wealth to me.

869
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,696
And what if I don't?

870
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:20,429
You must return it to me, Kasim.

871
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:18,754
Hey, monkey brand.

872
01:25:20,147 --> 01:25:23,959
Brother Kasim, where are you
heading to with this load?

873
01:25:24,118 --> 01:25:28,430
You idiot, all these things
are for my son Hasan.

874
01:25:28,922 --> 01:25:31,903
After many years, tomorrow I'll
take him to some hill station.

875
01:25:32,092 --> 01:25:33,765
I'll solve all his complaints.

876
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:39,776
But, monkey brand. Where are
you heading to, my dear?

877
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:42,642
To meet her.

878
01:25:42,736 --> 01:25:43,680
To see your mother? -What?

879
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:46,608
I mean have you trapped
some other girl now?

880
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:49,420
After many efforts I have
finally convinced..

881
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:52,753
..Seema to fall in love with me.

882
01:25:54,948 --> 01:25:56,484
You idiot.

883
01:25:57,818 --> 01:26:01,459
. Seema comes from a decent
and cultured family.

884
01:26:01,555 --> 01:26:03,091
Let me tell you something, dear.

885
01:26:03,557 --> 01:26:05,400
There are some norms
even in dishonesty.

886
01:26:05,492 --> 01:26:07,995
Even the thief spares
few houses.

887
01:26:08,929 --> 01:26:11,808
Monkey brand, why are
you nodding head?

888
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:13,935
Think before doing something.

889
01:26:14,034 --> 01:26:16,810
If you do something unusual
you'll be cursed and ruined.

890
01:26:16,904 --> 01:26:19,145
Leave it. Why do you
talk about ruin?

891
01:26:19,773 --> 01:26:21,878
Okay? -Okay. -Bye! -Bye!

892
01:26:58,879 --> 01:27:03,624
This shining silvery skin.

893
01:27:03,951 --> 01:27:08,832
This shining silvery skin
and glorious heart.

894
01:27:08,922 --> 01:27:13,496
You're a real beauty queen.

895
01:27:13,694 --> 01:27:16,072
You're a real beauty queen.

896
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:20,972
This shining silvery skin
and glorious heart.

897
01:27:21,068 --> 01:27:26,347
You're a real beauty queen.

898
01:27:28,575 --> 01:27:33,388
These magical eyes
and innocent face.

899
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:38,122
These magical eyes
and innocent face.

900
01:27:38,385 --> 01:27:42,731
You're a real beauty queen.

901
01:27:43,156 --> 01:27:46,035
You're a real beauty queen.

902
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:04,714
She feels scared if
I walk behind..

903
01:28:04,811 --> 01:28:09,590
..And shy if I come forward.

904
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:14,529
She feels scared if
I walk behind..

905
01:28:14,621 --> 01:28:18,967
..And shy if I come forward.

906
01:28:19,893 --> 01:28:22,533
By swear I'd sacrifice
my life.

907
01:28:22,629 --> 01:28:28,773
By swear I'd sacrifice my life
if you really believe..

908
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:34,544
..That you're my life
and my heartbeat.

909
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:38,987
You're a real beauty queen.

910
01:28:39,446 --> 01:28:41,824
You're a real beauty queen.

911
01:28:41,915 --> 01:28:46,591
This shining silvery skin
and glorious heart.

912
01:28:46,687 --> 01:28:51,932
You're a real beauty queen.

913
01:29:11,378 --> 01:29:15,884
Why do you leave me craving?

914
01:29:16,116 --> 01:29:20,963
Why do you make me long for?

915
01:29:21,054 --> 01:29:25,525
Why do you leave me craving?

916
01:29:25,892 --> 01:29:30,534
Why do you make me long for?

917
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:37,812
Nobody should come between
us, my love.

918
01:29:38,038 --> 01:29:40,518
This is what is aching me..

919
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:42,780
..As society is our enemy.

920
01:29:42,943 --> 01:29:47,358
You're a real beauty queen.

921
01:29:47,514 --> 01:29:50,017
You're a real beauty queen.

922
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:54,765
This shining silvery skin
and glorious heart.

923
01:29:54,888 --> 01:29:59,803
You're a real beauty queen.

924
01:30:19,613 --> 01:30:24,585
This heart is crazy for you.

925
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:29,134
This heart is crazy for you.

926
01:30:29,656 --> 01:30:33,695
I'll give you some gift.

927
01:30:34,628 --> 01:30:38,701
What else I should
serve you with?

928
01:30:38,799 --> 01:30:42,713
My love, have some shame.

929
01:30:44,404 --> 01:30:46,350
I'm there in front of you.

930
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,852
Come, what's stopping you?

931
01:30:48,942 --> 01:30:55,917
You're a real handsome guy.

932
01:30:56,016 --> 01:31:00,795
This shining silvery skin
and glorious heart.

933
01:31:00,887 --> 01:31:05,427
You're a real beauty queen.

934
01:31:06,059 --> 01:31:09,006
Impudent, do you think love
is the other name of lust?

935
01:31:09,663 --> 01:31:11,734
Do you think I'm one of those
Vagabond ordinary girl..

936
01:31:12,032 --> 01:31:13,909
..With whom you can
behave anyways?

937
01:31:14,768 --> 01:31:16,645
But.. but I.. -Shut up..

938
01:31:17,304 --> 01:31:19,716
- Seema, I regret.

939
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,986
And you'll regret all your life.

940
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:25,321
If your conscience
is still alive..

941
01:31:25,378 --> 01:31:27,722
..Behind your dirty soul then..

942
01:31:30,617 --> 01:31:34,759
Seema.. seema, please forgive
me. I love you.

943
01:31:38,425 --> 01:31:40,336
First go and ask some decent
and respectable..

944
01:31:40,393 --> 01:31:42,873
"Person what love means.

945
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:45,833
Then ask yourself, are
you worth for it?

946
01:31:56,843 --> 01:31:58,789
What?

947
01:32:08,722 --> 01:32:09,757
What happened to my son Hasan?

948
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,991
Where's my son, principal?

949
01:32:11,091 --> 01:32:14,402
Morning, he was playing on the
ground with some boys..

950
01:32:14,661 --> 01:32:16,766
..After that he's gone missing.

951
01:32:17,731 --> 01:32:19,677
Boy gone missing from
the playground..

952
01:32:19,933 --> 01:32:21,310
..And you couldn't come to know?

953
01:32:21,535 --> 01:32:23,310
Principal, what are you saying?

954
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:25,008
Is this how you run the school?

955
01:32:26,606 --> 01:32:27,448
Hello!

956
01:32:28,642 --> 01:32:31,623
Yes, he's there. Your phone.

957
01:32:32,546 --> 01:32:33,923
My phone? -Yes.

958
01:32:35,849 --> 01:32:38,557
Hello. -Hello, Kasim.

959
01:32:39,553 --> 01:32:41,430
Your son Hasan is with
me right now.

960
01:32:42,989 --> 01:32:44,866
My son is with you? -Yes.

961
01:32:45,392 --> 01:32:48,669
Who's speaking? -You
need not know that.

962
01:32:49,863 --> 01:32:51,843
Without telling anything
to anybody..

963
01:32:51,932 --> 01:32:54,003
..You just come out of
the school compound.

964
01:32:55,035 --> 01:32:59,074
My man is waiting for you in
a red car outside there.

965
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:33,051
Shera, you?!

966
01:33:35,609 --> 01:33:38,886
You thought Shera is dead?

967
01:33:39,813 --> 01:33:44,762
Shera has defeated his death
right before the birth.

968
01:33:45,452 --> 01:33:47,989
Then he was born in this world.

969
01:33:50,123 --> 01:33:53,536
Where's my son? -He's safe.

970
01:33:54,661 --> 01:33:56,572
Would you like to see him?

971
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:02,643
Dad! Dad!

972
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:07,852
Take me away from here, dad.
They beat me. They scare me.

973
01:34:08,408 --> 01:34:11,150
Please.. -How dare you?

974
01:34:11,411 --> 01:34:12,822
Stop Kasim.

975
01:34:14,447 --> 01:34:19,157
Take one step ahead and
your son will die.

976
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:26,837
Jagan sir you? -Yes, I. Both
of us made this plan.

977
01:34:27,627 --> 01:34:30,471
My mind and Shera's strength.

978
01:34:32,032 --> 01:34:37,539
If you want your son then
you must do my work.

979
01:34:37,804 --> 01:34:41,980
You've spoiled our plan to
deal with the government..

980
01:34:42,075 --> 01:34:44,021
..And get 25 of our
men released..

981
01:34:44,544 --> 01:34:47,024
..From the prison in exchange
of bus passengers' lives.

982
01:34:49,382 --> 01:34:52,795
And now.. you must get those..

983
01:34:52,886 --> 01:34:56,925
..25 men release
from the prison.

984
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:00,667
It's impossible. -Impossible?

985
01:35:02,362 --> 01:35:06,742
If you can attack on
my camp and get..

986
01:35:07,867 --> 01:35:11,679
..My hostages released then it's
not impossible for you..

987
01:35:12,405 --> 01:35:14,544
..To get my men released
from the prison.

988
01:35:15,475 --> 01:35:17,751
And if you won't do it then..

989
01:35:18,611 --> 01:35:21,387
..Do you know how your son
will be treated here?

990
01:35:21,948 --> 01:35:23,450
Hey..

991
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,728
.. I'll try..

992
01:35:29,956 --> 01:35:32,960
No try. You must do it.

993
01:35:34,094 --> 01:35:38,440
Kasim, what are you thinking?

994
01:35:39,566 --> 01:35:42,945
You'll do this for
your son's life..

995
01:35:43,503 --> 01:35:45,949
..Who's in the jaws
of death for now.

996
01:35:46,473 --> 01:35:47,816
Do it. Do it.

997
01:35:50,677 --> 01:35:51,781
One more thing.

998
01:35:55,348 --> 01:36:01,128
I want 25 men of mine.
All the 25.

999
01:36:02,489 --> 01:36:07,489
If one is less then.. -Your
son will be shot dead.

1000
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:15,104
No..

1001
01:36:17,971 --> 01:36:19,917
I'll do it for you.

1002
01:36:22,809 --> 01:36:26,450
Dad! Don't leave me alone, dad.

1003
01:36:26,713 --> 01:36:30,820
Don't leave me here. Please..
Don't leave me, dad.

1004
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:33,759
Don't leave me here.

1005
01:36:41,928 --> 01:36:47,537
Hasan, Allah will
protect you, son.

1006
01:36:49,869 --> 01:36:52,315
It's tough time for
both of us, son.

1007
01:36:53,773 --> 01:36:56,310
Have courage. Be courageous.
Very soon..

1008
01:36:56,376 --> 01:36:58,856
..I'll be back and
take you away.

1009
01:36:59,913 --> 01:37:02,325
Look, you'll support
your father..

1010
01:37:02,382 --> 01:37:04,362
..In this tough time, won't you?

1011
01:37:06,486 --> 01:37:08,557
You trust your dad, don't you?

1012
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:12,901
You'll support your
dad, don't you?

1013
01:37:17,063 --> 01:37:18,736
On Almighty!

1014
01:37:41,955 --> 01:37:43,696
Brother Kasim.

1015
01:37:45,692 --> 01:37:50,698
You said right about Seema.
Today I've taken a decision.

1016
01:37:51,631 --> 01:37:56,876
I'll lead a respectful life
and will marry only Seema.

1017
01:37:59,839 --> 01:38:04,618
Do get married, buddy.
But never sire.

1018
01:38:07,647 --> 01:38:10,355
Man can endure anything..

1019
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:14,864
..But not the separation
from his child.

1020
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:22,032
Other pains just injures
the body.

1021
01:38:23,096 --> 01:38:27,943
But the pain of separation from
child shatters your soul.

1022
01:38:28,368 --> 01:38:29,938
What's the matter,
brother Kasim?

1023
01:38:34,007 --> 01:38:35,816
By swear of me, brother Kasim.

1024
01:38:36,643 --> 01:38:38,054
What's the matter?

1025
01:38:40,413 --> 01:38:42,859
My son Hasan. -What
happened to him?

1026
01:38:44,284 --> 01:38:46,059
Shera and Jagan sir
has kidnapped him.

1027
01:38:46,452 --> 01:38:48,932
What? -Yes, Karan.

1028
01:38:50,924 --> 01:38:56,602
They want me to release 25 of
his men from the prison..

1029
01:38:57,797 --> 01:39:00,835
..Because we had released
their hostages.

1030
01:39:02,001 --> 01:39:03,878
They're punishing me for that.

1031
01:39:04,437 --> 01:39:07,907
Brother Kasim. I'm with
you in this work.

1032
01:39:08,508 --> 01:39:11,421
Not only Karan even
I'm with you.

1033
01:39:12,812 --> 01:39:14,416
Blood relations are not
the only relations.

1034
01:39:14,881 --> 01:39:16,622
Humanity too have
some relations.

1035
01:39:16,983 --> 01:39:20,658
Brother Kasim. -What if invite
Amar to join hands with us?

1036
01:39:23,523 --> 01:39:28,438
No, Karan. Amar has resigned
from the police department..

1037
01:39:29,095 --> 01:39:31,541
..But he still worships law.

1038
01:39:32,899 --> 01:39:37,370
And what we're going
to do is illegal.

1039
01:39:38,504 --> 01:39:41,041
And Amar is the enemy of
every illegal thing.

1040
01:39:42,342 --> 01:39:44,322
So, he should not even
get a hint of it.

1041
01:39:45,478 --> 01:39:46,957
Congratulations, Shera.

1042
01:39:47,547 --> 01:39:50,687
Kasim has involved Karan
in this work.

1043
01:39:52,952 --> 01:39:55,933
Once my men get release
from the prison..

1044
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:59,365
..Then I'll avenge with the Law.

1045
01:40:00,393 --> 01:40:05,604
Robber, loot, terror, murder
in broad daylight.

1046
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:10,448
You'll do this, Shera.
But the way I'll..

1047
01:40:10,536 --> 01:40:12,846
..Break the peace
of this country..

1048
01:40:12,939 --> 01:40:17,046
..Not only humans but
even the God.. Hey..

1049
01:40:21,514 --> 01:40:22,492
Who are you?

1050
01:40:23,516 --> 01:40:25,587
Your new servant. Rahim Khan.

1051
01:40:25,852 --> 01:40:27,923
I just came to ask you
if you want something.

1052
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:29,898
Had you come to ask for it or
listen to our conversation?

1053
01:40:29,989 --> 01:40:32,833
Tell me whom are you spying for?
- Spying and I? -Tell me.

1054
01:40:39,565 --> 01:40:41,010
Follow him. He shouldn't
escape. Go.

1055
01:40:55,448 --> 01:40:58,520
Hello! -Amar, my
son. Rahim here.

1056
01:40:58,785 --> 01:41:00,856
What's the matter, uncle Rahim?
Why are you so scared?

1057
01:41:02,922 --> 01:41:06,062
The matter is such. Your friends
Karan and Kasim..

1058
01:41:06,592 --> 01:41:10,563
..Are going to release 25
dangerous prisoners..

1059
01:41:10,663 --> 01:41:11,801
..From the jail on insistence
of Jagan and Shera.

1060
01:41:11,898 --> 01:41:13,309
What are you saying,
uncle Rahim?

1061
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:16,005
I know them very well.
They're not so low.

1062
01:41:16,436 --> 01:41:17,779
Believe me, Amar.

1063
01:41:18,104 --> 01:41:20,914
I've heard Shera and Jagan's
conversation.

1064
01:41:26,779 --> 01:41:31,125
Uncle Rahim! Uncle Rahim!
Uncle Rahim!

1065
01:42:04,884 --> 01:42:08,331
Kasim, I know where you're going
with these explosives..

1066
01:42:08,988 --> 01:42:11,366
..And what you're going
to destruct.

1067
01:42:12,492 --> 01:42:14,335
I'm not going to destruct
anything..

1068
01:42:14,994 --> 01:42:17,531
..But going to do away
with my destruction.

1069
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:21,510
To do away with the destruction
or make money?

1070
01:42:21,601 --> 01:42:23,080
Almighty.

1071
01:42:23,703 --> 01:42:27,742
Money is your Almighty,
Allah, and lord..

1072
01:42:28,508 --> 01:42:31,387
..For which you can even
sell your soul.

1073
01:42:32,845 --> 01:42:36,349
But I won't let you do
this crime today.

1074
01:42:36,849 --> 01:42:39,022
Let us go, buddy.

1075
01:42:39,519 --> 01:42:40,998
By swear of God, let me go.

1076
01:42:41,087 --> 01:42:45,058
Kasim, I'm your friend that's
why I've come to stop you.

1077
01:42:46,492 --> 01:42:51,032
Had I not been your friend..

1078
01:42:51,831 --> 01:42:55,278
..Police would have handcuffed
you on my signal.

1079
01:42:55,368 --> 01:42:59,874
Even the gallows wouldn't
stop us today.

1080
01:43:01,741 --> 01:43:04,312
C'mon, Karan. -Don't you
dare take a step ahead.

1081
01:43:06,345 --> 01:43:10,760
I won't allow you to be a
traitor of country for money.

1082
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:13,620
Move away from my way, Amar.

1083
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:17,001
Otherwise, my anger may
burn you to ashes.

1084
01:43:17,089 --> 01:43:21,504
The people whom you're going to
release will burn the pyres.

1085
01:43:22,862 --> 01:43:25,468
Many innocents will get killed.

1086
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:27,776
By helping them release..

1087
01:43:27,867 --> 01:43:30,347
..You're going to kill
humanity today.

1088
01:43:30,736 --> 01:43:33,478
Nobody can stop me today, Amar.

1089
01:43:34,407 --> 01:43:36,910
I'll break all the walls today.

1090
01:44:14,447 --> 01:44:16,427
Amar! Kasim!

1091
01:44:17,483 --> 01:44:19,759
Amar, what are you
doing? -Move away.

1092
01:44:19,852 --> 01:44:22,162
I'll teach him a lesson today.

1093
01:44:23,122 --> 01:44:24,567
You're taking him wrong.
- Don't tell him.

1094
01:44:24,657 --> 01:44:26,102
He's not going to do
any thing illegal.

1095
01:44:26,425 --> 01:44:27,563
You won't say anything, Anita.

1096
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:31,806
Let me say, Kasim. Amar. Hasan
is in Shera's custody.

1097
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:34,105
And both of them.. -What?
Hasan in Shera's custody?

1098
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:37,106
Yes. -How and when
this happened?

1099
01:44:37,169 --> 01:44:38,842
How did he fall into his hands?

1100
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:41,886
Because we had helped you once.

1101
01:44:43,376 --> 01:44:45,982
That rascal kidnapped our Hasan.

1102
01:44:46,779 --> 01:44:49,316
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

1103
01:44:49,982 --> 01:44:53,691
You think I'm just
made for the Law?

1104
01:44:54,053 --> 01:44:55,964
I don't have a heart?

1105
01:44:56,789 --> 01:44:58,666
Hasan is nothing to me?

1106
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:05,803
Kasim, if not as a friend,
take me as an enemy.

1107
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,575
Sometime even enemy
comes to use.

1108
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:28,091
Son! Wake up, son. Eat this
food. Eat it, son.

1109
01:45:35,361 --> 01:45:40,401
Dad, save me. Save me, dad.

1110
01:45:44,103 --> 01:45:46,913
Right in the middle of this
area is the jail..

1111
01:45:48,774 --> 01:45:51,380
..Where Shera's 25 dangerous
men are imprisoned.

1112
01:45:52,845 --> 01:45:57,089
They're the prisoners who just
believes in destruction.

1113
01:45:57,650 --> 01:46:00,358
They just know to kill
people and shed blood.

1114
01:46:00,686 --> 01:46:04,099
There aim of life is
to kill people.

1115
01:46:33,419 --> 01:46:34,454
C'mon.

1116
01:46:39,592 --> 01:46:42,436
This is the place where these
25 men come to work..

1117
01:46:43,362 --> 01:46:45,740
..With many other prisoners.

1118
01:46:47,333 --> 01:46:49,643
Actually, they come
in three groups.

1119
01:46:50,002 --> 01:46:53,643
In which one group contains
only Shera's men.

1120
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:58,852
This is the first group
that daily goes..

1121
01:46:59,445 --> 01:47:02,858
..From one end to the
other on gunpoint.

1122
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:08,063
Till the first group reaches
the other end..

1123
01:47:09,989 --> 01:47:12,026
"Second group keeps waiting.

1124
01:47:14,694 --> 01:47:17,368
Likewise, after the second
group have crossed..

1125
01:47:18,464 --> 01:47:21,502
..The bridge, the third
group follows.

1126
01:47:28,074 --> 01:47:31,578
This third group is full
of Shera's men.

1127
01:47:32,411 --> 01:47:36,154
After the job is done.
These prisoners are..

1128
01:47:36,749 --> 01:47:39,355
..Taken back in the same
group from this bridge.

1129
01:47:39,752 --> 01:47:44,633
Moment the third group is ready
to cross the bridge..

1130
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:46,326
..Right at that time..

1131
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:42,755
Hey, c'mon, hurry
up. Move ahead.

1132
01:48:43,082 --> 01:48:46,723
Quickly. C'mon. C'mon, hurry up.

1133
01:48:55,361 --> 01:48:56,396
Stop, Karan.

1134
01:48:58,697 --> 01:49:00,973
Two men of Shera's group have..

1135
01:49:08,908 --> 01:49:12,822
Hey, you're from the number
3 batch. Go back. Go.

1136
01:49:52,985 --> 01:49:56,865
Run! Run!

1137
01:50:03,062 --> 01:50:07,101
C'mon, let's go. Shera has
sent us. C'mon, hurry up.

1138
01:50:08,367 --> 01:50:10,347
C'mon.. c'mon.. let's
go quickly.

1139
01:50:12,504 --> 01:50:14,984
We're Shera's men. Hurry up.
C'mon. Let's go quickly.

1140
01:50:16,976 --> 01:50:21,118
Let's go. C'mon.
hurry up! C'mon.

1141
01:50:44,637 --> 01:50:45,707
Congratulation, Shera.

1142
01:50:46,672 --> 01:50:49,585
Kasim, Amar and Karan have
released our men.

1143
01:50:51,343 --> 01:50:57,419
That's the spirit. Now I'll
enjoy fighting with the Law.

1144
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:00,330
It's a shameful incidence for
the entire police department.

1145
01:51:01,287 --> 01:51:04,700
In spite of having such
a tight security..

1146
01:51:04,757 --> 01:51:07,033
..Three men came and took
away 25 prisoners?

1147
01:51:08,427 --> 01:51:13,934
Disgraceful! I want those
prisoners back to the jail.

1148
01:51:14,533 --> 01:51:15,603
Understand?

1149
01:51:43,329 --> 01:51:45,036
It seems they've entered
into the forest.

1150
01:51:45,464 --> 01:51:46,636
Arrange for the sniffer dogs.

1151
01:52:10,456 --> 01:52:11,491
Let's go.

1152
01:52:43,689 --> 01:52:50,299
You rascal. You're making us
walk and walk all the time.

1153
01:52:52,531 --> 01:52:55,375
Bad luck.. that the girls
are walking behind.

1154
01:52:55,768 --> 01:52:58,374
Had they been walking together..

1155
01:52:58,937 --> 01:53:00,917
..We'd feel little less tired
seeing their faces.

1156
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:05,081
I'm dying. I want
water and food.

1157
01:53:05,878 --> 01:53:08,484
Hunger and thirst will kill me.

1158
01:53:09,048 --> 01:53:12,052
Hey, are you a men or a devil?

1159
01:53:13,852 --> 01:53:16,526
Even the police officers
are not so heartless.

1160
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:23,103
Now I think I'll die if
I take one step ahead.

1161
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:30,346
Enough! Now we can't walk.
- Yes, we can't walk.

1162
01:53:31,403 --> 01:53:32,939
Who would not be able to walk?

1163
01:53:36,075 --> 01:53:38,385
I'm listening to your
nonsense since when.

1164
01:53:39,812 --> 01:53:42,793
Now of you utter a single more
word, I'll cut off your tongue.

1165
01:53:45,818 --> 01:53:46,888
Follow me.

1166
01:54:19,084 --> 01:54:20,358
C'mon, eat this food.

1167
01:54:48,547 --> 01:54:51,960
Eat like humans and not
like animals. Sit down.

1168
01:55:30,155 --> 01:55:33,500
Ah! Help!

1169
01:55:38,096 --> 01:55:39,439
Help!

1170
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:50,669
Uncle! I feel scared over here.

1171
01:57:51,029 --> 01:57:52,303
Uncle, take me away from here.

1172
01:57:52,764 --> 01:57:54,072
Take me away from here, uncle.

1173
01:57:54,366 --> 01:57:56,573
Don't feel scared,
son. I'm there.

1174
01:57:57,769 --> 01:58:01,842
Take me to my dad, uncle.
Take me to my dad.

1175
01:58:02,607 --> 01:58:06,077
I feel very scared, uncle.
- I'm helpless, son.

1176
01:58:06,478 --> 01:58:09,516
I can't do anything.
I can't do anything.

1177
01:58:10,682 --> 01:58:12,992
Eat something, son. Eat it.

1178
01:58:13,452 --> 01:58:15,796
Uncle. Don't leave me
alone over here.

1179
01:58:16,021 --> 01:58:17,932
I can't do anything,
son. -Uncle.

1180
01:58:18,423 --> 01:58:22,769
Please, uncle. Don't leave
me alone. Please.. uncle.

1181
01:58:23,829 --> 01:58:24,864
Uncle!

1182
01:59:31,563 --> 01:59:32,633
Stop!

1183
01:59:36,968 --> 01:59:40,347
Where were you trying
to escape? Tell me.

1184
01:59:41,139 --> 01:59:42,345
Tell me.

1185
01:59:46,945 --> 01:59:47,946
Ram Singh!

1186
01:59:53,852 --> 01:59:54,853
Yes!

1187
01:59:59,391 --> 02:00:03,362
Sir, I don't know how
he went up. I..

1188
02:00:03,662 --> 02:00:06,575
Believe me, sir. Sir,
I know nothing.

1189
02:00:06,631 --> 02:00:08,907
I know nothing, sir.
I know nothing.

1190
02:00:09,935 --> 02:00:11,005
I know nothing.

1191
02:00:13,572 --> 02:00:14,573
I know nothing.

1192
02:00:47,606 --> 02:00:54,285
1,2,3,4,5,6,
1, 8, 9, 10, 11..

1193
02:00:54,346 --> 02:01:01,821
..12,13,14,15,
16,17,18,19..

1194
02:01:04,656 --> 02:01:08,001
19? Where are the rest?

1195
02:01:13,632 --> 02:01:14,702
Kasim!

1196
02:01:17,769 --> 02:01:19,908
Kasim, 6 prisoners have
escaped. -What?

1197
02:01:19,971 --> 02:01:22,349
Where have they gone?
Where? -Allah.

1198
02:01:23,775 --> 02:01:26,847
Amar, we must find
these prisoners.

1199
02:01:27,579 --> 02:01:30,082
Otherwise as per Shera's
condition..

1200
02:01:30,882 --> 02:01:32,555
..If one prisoner is less he
won't spare my son's life.

1201
02:01:32,617 --> 02:01:33,994
What are you saying? -Yes.

1202
02:01:34,052 --> 02:01:35,531
It'll never happen, Kasim.

1203
02:01:36,354 --> 02:01:37,833
It can never happen
till I'm alive.

1204
02:01:39,591 --> 02:01:40,626
Don't lose courage.

1205
02:01:41,059 --> 02:01:42,834
Anita! -Yes.

1206
02:01:43,361 --> 02:01:45,398
We're going out in search
of 6 prisoners.

1207
02:01:45,897 --> 02:01:47,934
Both of you be alert.
Take this revolver.

1208
02:01:48,366 --> 02:01:49,936
Not a single prisoner
should escape.

1209
02:01:50,368 --> 02:01:52,279
What are you saying? How
will the two of them..

1210
02:01:52,337 --> 02:01:53,782
..Control these 19 dangerous
prisoners?

1211
02:01:54,005 --> 02:01:57,282
We'll manage. You go. -What
nonsense are you..

1212
02:01:57,342 --> 02:01:58,377
Don't be adamant, Kasim.

1213
02:01:58,977 --> 02:02:01,753
Hasan's life is much more
important that ours.

1214
02:02:02,414 --> 02:02:05,725
By swear of God. Go
fast. -Almighty.

1215
02:02:05,784 --> 02:02:08,788
Karan, give your revolver
to her. C'mon, let's go.

1216
02:02:39,084 --> 02:02:40,324
Don't you dare move forward.

1217
02:02:45,857 --> 02:02:48,303
Hello, baby.

1218
02:02:54,032 --> 02:02:55,340
Don't come forward.

1219
02:02:56,901 --> 02:02:57,971
I said stop.

1220
02:02:58,803 --> 02:02:59,907
Otherwise I'll shoot.

1221
02:03:00,338 --> 02:03:04,582
Go ahead. Shoot. How
many will you kill?

1222
02:03:06,645 --> 02:03:07,988
You've two revolvers.

1223
02:03:09,347 --> 02:03:12,624
And one revolver contains
only 6 bullets.

1224
02:03:14,653 --> 02:03:20,103
That means you can injure
only 12 of us.

1225
02:03:21,593 --> 02:03:25,040
What will you do with the
rest of the seven, chic?

1226
02:03:27,365 --> 02:03:34,442
And then the rest of the seven
will enjoy at their fullest..

1227
02:03:34,506 --> 02:03:43,654
..With the two of you.
Think about it.

1228
02:04:17,949 --> 02:04:21,396
Thin waist and long hair I've..

1229
02:04:21,453 --> 02:04:25,458
..And I'm just 16.

1230
02:04:26,658 --> 02:04:29,639
Thin waist and long hair I've..

1231
02:04:29,894 --> 02:04:33,899
..And I'm just 16.

1232
02:04:35,133 --> 02:04:38,137
Dark eyes and rosy cheeks..

1233
02:04:38,436 --> 02:04:42,543
..And I'm just 16.

1234
02:04:42,941 --> 02:04:44,716
We too are young.

1235
02:04:45,043 --> 02:04:47,080
May you be saved
from evil eyes.

1236
02:04:47,378 --> 02:04:49,051
Nobody is like us over here.

1237
02:04:49,114 --> 02:04:51,390
May you be saved
from evil eyes.

1238
02:04:51,449 --> 02:04:56,364
I'm ruined, I'm doomed.
Take care.

1239
02:04:56,421 --> 02:04:59,561
Thin waist and long hair I've..

1240
02:04:59,624 --> 02:05:03,572
..And I'm just 16.

1241
02:05:04,662 --> 02:05:07,802
Dark eyes and rosy cheeks..

1242
02:05:07,866 --> 02:05:11,939
..And I'm just 16.

1243
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:38,631
This shining face is for you.

1244
02:05:38,696 --> 02:05:43,111
It's for me. it's for me.

1245
02:05:43,168 --> 02:05:47,310
The desirous heart
aches for you.

1246
02:05:47,372 --> 02:05:51,514
For me.. for me..

1247
02:05:51,576 --> 02:05:55,820
We'll die and keep the
promise of your love.

1248
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:59,885
Let alone heart, this
life is for you.

1249
02:05:59,951 --> 02:06:03,899
May you live long! -Don't
kill me like that.

1250
02:06:03,955 --> 02:06:07,994
May you live long! -Don't
kill me like that.

1251
02:06:08,059 --> 02:06:12,633
Don't avenge with me.

1252
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:16,003
Thin waist and long hair I've..

1253
02:06:16,067 --> 02:06:20,038
..And I'm just 16.

1254
02:06:21,372 --> 02:06:24,444
Dark eyes and rosy cheeks..

1255
02:06:24,509 --> 02:06:28,423
..And I'm just 16.

1256
02:06:54,105 --> 02:06:58,451
It's not good to express
the love openly.

1257
02:06:58,910 --> 02:07:00,480
Why?

1258
02:07:00,778 --> 02:07:04,920
You'll be disgraced
in the society.

1259
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:06,727
Why?

1260
02:07:07,018 --> 02:07:10,966
My tender will heart will
always long for..

1261
02:07:11,022 --> 02:07:15,368
It's not good to make
the damsels envy.

1262
02:07:15,426 --> 02:07:19,374
It'll never happen. -Let's
go somewhere else.

1263
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:23,378
We never thought about it.
- Let's go somewhere else.

1264
02:07:23,434 --> 02:07:27,780
We'll walk and enjoy
on the way.

1265
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:31,484
Thin waist and long hair I've..

1266
02:07:31,542 --> 02:07:34,989
..And I'm just 16.

1267
02:07:36,681 --> 02:07:39,457
Dark eyes and rosy cheeks..

1268
02:07:39,817 --> 02:07:43,890
..And I'm just 16.

1269
02:08:09,514 --> 02:08:13,485
I hope I'm not getting deceived
about your love.

1270
02:08:13,551 --> 02:08:17,693
No, you're not. You're not.

1271
02:08:17,956 --> 02:08:21,927
There are many fans but
none is like you.

1272
02:08:21,993 --> 02:08:26,135
Yes, no one is like me.

1273
02:08:26,464 --> 02:08:30,344
Yes, no one is like me.

1274
02:08:30,568 --> 02:08:34,675
What you did today,
it never happens.

1275
02:08:34,739 --> 02:08:38,482
Grace me today. -Don't tease
me, for God's sake.

1276
02:08:38,543 --> 02:08:40,454
Do away with your shyness now.

1277
02:08:40,511 --> 02:08:42,616
Don't tease me,
for God's sake.

1278
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:46,856
What magic you do?

1279
02:08:47,418 --> 02:08:50,422
Thin waist and long hair I've..

1280
02:08:50,488 --> 02:08:54,368
..And I'm just 16.

1281
02:08:55,393 --> 02:08:58,636
Dark eyes and rosy cheeks..

1282
02:08:58,696 --> 02:09:02,508
..And I'm just 16.

1283
02:09:02,967 --> 02:09:04,640
Look at me once.

1284
02:09:08,339 --> 02:09:09,647
Look at me once.

1285
02:09:13,378 --> 02:09:14,857
Look at me once.

1286
02:09:15,113 --> 02:09:16,854
Look at me once.

1287
02:09:17,315 --> 02:09:18,794
Look at me once.

1288
02:09:19,317 --> 02:09:22,821
Look at me once..
once.. once..

1289
02:09:22,887 --> 02:09:25,834
Once.. once.. once..

1290
02:09:33,631 --> 02:09:35,907
Very pretty.

1291
02:09:39,404 --> 02:09:41,008
Leave us! Leave us!

1292
02:09:43,007 --> 02:09:45,578
Leave us! Leave us!

1293
02:09:46,644 --> 02:09:48,590
Leave us! Leave us!

1294
02:09:52,083 --> 02:09:54,654
Leave us! Leave us!

1295
02:10:11,369 --> 02:10:12,746
Wow!

1296
02:10:13,838 --> 02:10:21,086
First thing is that you're free
and your men has guns.

1297
02:10:21,546 --> 02:10:26,586
Is this the reason of
our power, wrestler?

1298
02:10:26,784 --> 02:10:33,030
If you come from a brave
and decent family..

1299
02:10:33,091 --> 02:10:38,370
..Then throw away the guns.

1300
02:10:39,063 --> 02:10:45,036
And fight with us. Then
we'll see who's braver.

1301
02:11:01,953 --> 02:11:06,663
Did you come to know
how brave you're?

1302
02:11:07,959 --> 02:11:10,803
Do you want to know about
the decency of my family?

1303
02:11:10,862 --> 02:11:12,967
I'd like to know.

1304
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:10,431
Karan, untie him.

1305
02:12:32,343 --> 02:12:33,413
Pick it up.

1306
02:14:20,051 --> 02:14:22,657
Henceforth, if anybody
will dare to escape..

1307
02:14:23,554 --> 02:14:25,591
..Then he too will be
treated like this.

1308
02:14:32,530 --> 02:14:33,941
Stop! Look at this.

1309
02:14:37,435 --> 02:14:38,436
Let them sniff.

1310
02:14:41,939 --> 02:14:43,543
It seems the prisoners
are somewhere near.

1311
02:14:44,041 --> 02:14:45,076
Let the dogs go.

1312
02:16:01,952 --> 02:16:03,022
Now what will happen, sir?

1313
02:16:04,455 --> 02:16:06,594
It's difficult to reach
to them without dogs.

1314
02:17:09,753 --> 02:17:11,960
You idiot? Did you forget
Shera's condition?

1315
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:14,561
You want to play with Hasan's
life by killing him?

1316
02:17:15,893 --> 02:17:22,538
I know. But I can't sacrifice
my friend to save my son.

1317
02:17:24,401 --> 02:17:28,474
Kasim, I know.. I know.
But we must save him.

1318
02:17:28,539 --> 02:17:29,813
We must save him by any cost.

1319
02:17:30,774 --> 02:17:31,809
Get me a knife.

1320
02:17:51,061 --> 02:17:52,836
First eat the food lying
on the ground..

1321
02:17:53,697 --> 02:17:56,871
..And then from the plate.
Okay? Keep watch.

1322
02:20:24,548 --> 02:20:27,893
Karan, we must save him for
the sake of Hasan's life.

1323
02:20:31,755 --> 02:20:33,029
Catch the rope.

1324
02:20:52,743 --> 02:20:54,051
Carefully, Karan.

1325
02:20:57,448 --> 02:20:58,483
Carefully.

1326
02:21:07,091 --> 02:21:08,297
Well done!

1327
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:10,360
Well done, Karan.

1328
02:21:13,464 --> 02:21:15,444
Are you alright? Hey..

1329
02:21:17,768 --> 02:21:19,805
Kasim, he's alright.

1330
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:41,026
Hey, you get limited food and
limited time to sleep here.

1331
02:21:41,091 --> 02:21:45,562
Get up. If you'd sleep
more, I'll kill you.

1332
02:22:15,692 --> 02:22:17,933
How long we'll have to
carry this fatso?

1333
02:22:18,796 --> 02:22:19,900
Look down.

1334
02:22:58,302 --> 02:22:59,372
It seems he's dead.

1335
02:23:12,516 --> 02:23:21,095
Kasim, I had told you that I
want all the 25 men of mine.

1336
02:23:22,292 --> 02:23:25,501
Not a single less. -No..

1337
02:23:25,863 --> 02:23:27,672
No, Shera. No.. look..

1338
02:23:29,333 --> 02:23:32,109
You.. You can kill me.
But leave my son.

1339
02:23:32,636 --> 02:23:34,843
Yes.. I didn't do it
intentionally, Shera.

1340
02:23:35,072 --> 02:23:37,814
I didn't do it intentionally,
Shera.

1341
02:23:38,942 --> 02:23:41,479
Shera, I didn't do it..

1342
02:23:53,991 --> 02:23:55,698
He's saved.

1343
02:24:03,367 --> 02:24:04,505
Thank God.

1344
02:24:24,421 --> 02:24:25,456
Hasan!

1345
02:24:26,757 --> 02:24:29,829
Dad! Dad!

1346
02:24:31,628 --> 02:24:32,732
Uncle!

1347
02:24:41,438 --> 02:24:43,918
Shera, we kept our promise.

1348
02:24:47,878 --> 02:24:49,983
Now you too keep your promise.

1349
02:24:50,647 --> 02:24:52,524
Promise? What promise?

1350
02:24:52,582 --> 02:24:55,392
What promise? -He's right.

1351
02:24:55,886 --> 02:25:00,392
We break promises like the
dacoits who break safe.

1352
02:25:00,457 --> 02:25:01,527
Rascal.

1353
02:25:03,093 --> 02:25:07,405
Last time you had attacked
on my den..

1354
02:25:08,131 --> 02:25:09,940
..And made a big loss of mine.

1355
02:25:11,101 --> 02:25:13,081
You killed many of my men.

1356
02:25:14,071 --> 02:25:19,350
I destroy colonies on the
death of my one man.

1357
02:25:20,744 --> 02:25:22,417
Then how can I spare you?

1358
02:25:22,846 --> 02:25:26,020
Tie them. -C'mon.

1359
02:25:30,954 --> 02:25:32,865
Not you.. you alone.

1360
02:25:34,791 --> 02:25:36,361
Yes.. -C'mon..

1361
02:25:38,061 --> 02:25:39,699
Celebrate.

1362
02:25:43,834 --> 02:25:48,874
Girls, that day you
had danced for me.

1363
02:25:49,506 --> 02:25:54,319
But today you'll dance
to please my men.

1364
02:25:54,945 --> 02:25:57,118
You dance so well.

1365
02:25:58,882 --> 02:26:00,384
And listen.

1366
02:26:01,351 --> 02:26:06,027
This boy's life is in your legs.

1367
02:26:07,057 --> 02:26:10,800
Till you keep dancing, the
boy will remain alive.

1368
02:26:12,129 --> 02:26:15,576
And the moment you stop,
Amar and Karan..

1369
02:26:15,632 --> 02:26:20,138
..Will be shot. They'll
lose balance..

1370
02:26:20,370 --> 02:26:24,580
..And this boy will be
hanged on to gallows.

1371
02:26:26,743 --> 02:26:29,986
Your silence will be considered
your refusal.

1372
02:26:31,148 --> 02:26:33,685
And bullets will be fired
on your refusal.

1373
02:27:16,393 --> 02:27:20,705
Who are you to ruin us?

1374
02:27:21,665 --> 02:27:26,375
Who are you to ruin us?

1375
02:27:26,837 --> 02:27:31,411
How will you make poor
bend at your feet?

1376
02:27:31,942 --> 02:27:33,979
How will you?

1377
02:27:34,511 --> 02:27:39,085
Who are you to ruin us?

1378
02:27:39,616 --> 02:27:44,429
How will you make poor
bend at your feet?

1379
02:27:44,621 --> 02:27:46,464
How will you?

1380
02:27:46,890 --> 02:27:51,566
We'll dance till
our last breath.

1381
02:27:52,362 --> 02:27:56,435
We'll dance till
our last breath.

1382
02:27:57,067 --> 02:28:01,914
The Creator will save us.

1383
02:28:02,372 --> 02:28:06,479
The Creator will save us.

1384
02:28:07,444 --> 02:28:11,950
How will you make poor
bend at your feet?

1385
02:28:12,415 --> 02:28:14,452
How will you?

1386
02:28:14,718 --> 02:28:16,527
Who are you?

1387
02:28:42,646 --> 02:28:47,322
You're overconfident
about your power.

1388
02:28:47,817 --> 02:28:52,095
You don't know your end.

1389
02:28:52,689 --> 02:28:57,604
Your name.. -..and your
deeds are evil.

1390
02:28:57,661 --> 02:29:02,076
Remember, your.. -..end
will be the worst.

1391
02:29:02,766 --> 02:29:07,044
Sighs always curses.

1392
02:29:07,737 --> 02:29:11,514
You'll be punished
for your crime.

1393
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:16,615
Nobody can lead an
artificial life.

1394
02:29:17,681 --> 02:29:21,561
Nobody can lead an
artificial life.

1395
02:29:22,586 --> 02:29:26,693
How will you make poor
bend at your feet?

1396
02:29:27,490 --> 02:29:29,436
How will you?

1397
02:29:29,826 --> 02:29:31,533
Who are you?

1398
02:29:45,408 --> 02:29:46,478
Dad!

1399
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:53,721
Girls, why are you surprised?

1400
02:29:54,884 --> 02:30:00,391
I had told you that it's our
habit to break promises.

1401
02:30:01,358 --> 02:30:02,428
Dance.

1402
02:30:33,957 --> 02:30:38,906
When the blood sheds.. -It
takes the form of fire.

1403
02:30:38,962 --> 02:30:43,570
Today your tyranny.. -..will
be justified here.

1404
02:30:44,034 --> 02:30:46,480
You won't have scope
of survival.

1405
02:30:46,770 --> 02:30:48,716
You won't find rest.

1406
02:30:49,072 --> 02:30:53,885
Innocent's blood always
brings justice.

1407
02:30:54,344 --> 02:30:58,918
God gives justice.

1408
02:30:59,382 --> 02:31:03,330
God gives justice.

1409
02:31:04,387 --> 02:31:08,836
Everybody pays for
his or her deeds.

1410
02:31:09,459 --> 02:31:13,498
Your own ones will betray you.

1411
02:31:14,331 --> 02:31:18,609
Your own ones will betray you.

1412
02:31:19,369 --> 02:31:22,816
How will you make poor
bend at your feet?

1413
02:31:23,973 --> 02:31:25,748
How will you?

1414
02:31:26,409 --> 02:31:30,551
Who are you to ruin us?

1415
02:31:31,381 --> 02:31:35,523
Who are you to ruin us?

1416
02:31:36,353 --> 02:31:40,699
How will you make poor
bend at your feet?

1417
02:31:41,024 --> 02:31:43,026
How will you?

1418
02:31:43,460 --> 02:31:47,408
How will you make poor
bend at your feet?

1419
02:31:48,365 --> 02:31:50,311
How will you?

1420
02:31:57,507 --> 02:31:58,542
Dad!

1421
02:32:25,368 --> 02:32:28,542
God is great!

1422
02:32:34,611 --> 02:32:35,681
Dad!

1423
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:52,562
Kill them.

1424
02:32:54,531 --> 02:32:56,442
Bheema, take care of
the explosives.

1425
02:32:56,499 --> 02:32:57,978
Otherwise, we may die.

1426
02:34:53,750 --> 02:34:54,785
No.

1427
02:35:53,776 --> 02:35:59,920
Now my explosives will be useful
to become your pyre.

1428
02:36:04,654 --> 02:36:05,860
Kasim!

1429
02:36:39,589 --> 02:36:40,659
Dad!

1430
02:36:41,724 --> 02:36:42,759
Uncle!

1431
02:36:50,566 --> 02:36:53,410
Amar! My brother.

1432
02:37:36,379 --> 02:37:40,850
Rascal! Get up. Get up for the
last time before you die.

1433
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:12,518
Get up, you scoundrel.

1434
02:38:37,540 --> 02:38:38,951
I won't die.

1435
02:38:40,743 --> 02:38:44,452
Shera had defeated his death..

1436
02:38:45,381 --> 02:38:47,520
..Before taking birth. -Shera!

1437
02:38:49,418 --> 02:38:50,795
Shera..
