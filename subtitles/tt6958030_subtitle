1
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,850
Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.

2
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,730
At the onset, allow me to apologize
to this wonderful gathering...

3
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,520
...for the delay in the program.

4
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,020
The Maestro had been
delayed by a pressing issue...

5
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,480
...of a personal kind.

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,440
However, he is here now,
and we shall begin presently.

7
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,190
Ayush, please open the door...

8
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,270
Ayush.

9
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,190
Ayush, open the door, please.

10
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,400
Ayush.

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,690
Ayush, for god sake, open the door.

12
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,480
Ayush, please open the door.

13
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,770
- Ayush...
- I've managed to keep them quiet for now.

14
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
But let me assure you...

15
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,150
...this decorum won't be
maintained in another 10 minutes.

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,520
I urge you, Ms. Nafisa,
as Ayush's manager...

17
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,770
...to get him out of the bloody room,
and make him work ...

18
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,190
...for the money
you've grabbed from us.

19
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,060
Please give me a minute.

20
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,690
Ayush, open the door, please.

21
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,850
Ayush, people are waiting for you.

22
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,350
For God's sake Ayush, open the door.

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,690
This isn't right.

24
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,850
Ayush.

25
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,150
Ayush.

26
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,690
"You exist in me like so, beloved..."

27
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,770
"...there's no part of me left."

28
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,020
"You've spread all the way to my soul..."

29
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,810
"...that now I dwell in you instead."

30
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,690
"You're my reality... and my hope."

31
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,020
"You're all I see wherever I look...
and in my memories too..."

32
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,940
"Whatever's left of me,
now belongs to you..."

33
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,190
"I am no longer myself anymore."

34
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,100
This is ridiculous. I've had enough.

35
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,020
I am sorry.

36
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,980
But we've little choice
but to break this door open.

37
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,850
- What?
- Ms. Nafisa, please.

38
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,730
But...

39
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,900
Darrel, Sam.
You break this bloody door down, please.

40
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,230
- Good God.
- Allah!

41
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,230
Someone call an ambulance.

42
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,480
Ayush.

43
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,270
Ayush.

44
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,020
Ayush.

45
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,770
Music.

46
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,770
Can you hear it?

47
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,940
A Fa... D-Sharp...E...

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,690
A Fe...CED...

49
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,850
- Asthana.
- Sir.

50
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,850
Where have you been
hiding him all this time?

51
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,810
I've never seen such a talent before.

52
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,020
Actually, sir,
I've no clue how he plays so well.

53
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,520
- How he plays so well?
- Yes...

54
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,400
What do you mean?

55
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,810
Actually,
sir...I had no formal training in music.

56
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,520
Whatever I play, I've learned myself.

57
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,270
By watching other pianists play...

58
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,850
- ...and from books as well.
- Unbelievable.

59
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,480
That is genius.

60
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,350
Unfortunately,
my niece, Meher isn't here...

61
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,810
...otherwise, she would've been
truly elated to hear your music.

62
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,350
Thank you so much, sir.

63
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,270
- Your compliment is all I need.
- It shouldn't be.

64
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,020
It shouldn't be enough.

65
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,150
You should take your music to the world.

66
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,560
You can be the sun,
and you're happy being a candle.

67
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,980
Sir...you know,
music is good for amusement...

68
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,350
...but, it doesn't pay the bills.

69
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,900
- So, in order to learn to play the Piano...
- He should go to England.

70
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,980
What?

71
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,270
You should go to England.

72
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,440
- But, I don't have...
- I do!

73
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,190
I have a suggestion.

74
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,440
The finest music school is in York.

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,310
And, a few kilometers
from York is my home.

76
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,900
The caretaker of
that home has grown old...

77
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,020
...and I am looking for new care-taker.

78
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,190
So, Ayush, if you are prepared
to look after my property...

79
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,100
...then, I can take responsibility
for your education.

80
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,940
So...how do you like this deal?

81
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,060
- W...Wi...Will you do this for me?
- Of course, I will.

82
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,980
Thank you so much, sir.

83
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,650
Thank you so much, sir.

84
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,650
"Erasing every distance from my heart..."

85
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:24,400
"...O beloved, I set out to meet you."

86
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,060
"Be my angel..."

87
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,560
"...be the sky to my stars."

88
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:46,350
"My darkness, and the light,

89
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,310
"...everything I own,
are all yours now."

90
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,520
"My darkness, and the light,

91
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:07,690
"...everything I own,
are all yours now."

92
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:14,520
"Let's walk with me in your arms."

93
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,440
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

94
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,980
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

95
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,400
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,600
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

97
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,730
Hello.

98
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,770
Hello. Hello.

99
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,770
Hello.

100
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,150
You must be the young gent from India.

101
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,190
Gosh, you are a young man, aren't you?

102
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,270
We did receive a letter from Mr. Wadia...

103
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,690
...to say you were coming.

104
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,190
I am Emma...

105
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,350
Emma Smith.

106
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,770
Ayush. Ayush Asthana.

107
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,900
So, glad to meet you.

108
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,600
Well, Mr. Jenkins, the old caretaker...

109
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,560
...is waiting to hand the reins over.

110
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,060
Aah...there he is now.

111
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,520
- A long-long journey, eh.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,850
Why don't I show you around this house...

113
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,150
...and hang this goddamn
Albatross around your neck.

114
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:33,900
"My darkness, and the light,

115
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:41,270
"...everything I own,
are all yours now."

116
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,230
"Let's walk with me in your arms."

117
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,770
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

118
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,400
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

119
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,900
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

120
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,100
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

121
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,480
Who's that?

122
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,810
'Dear father...'

123
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,980
'Hope you're fine,
and all is well back in Bombay..'

124
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,600
'I wish...even I could say the same.'
That everything is fine out here?'

125
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,520
'But it isn't.'

126
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,900
'It's been three months
since I got here.'

127
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,560
'Everything was fine when I arrived.'

128
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,350
'But then, I made a mistake.'

129
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,520
'A big mistake.'

130
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,520
'And because of that mistake,
now I can't go to the music school...'

131
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,440
'...or meet anyone.'

132
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,940
'I hide all day out of fear.'

133
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,270
'Moreover,
I think because of my mistake...'

134
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,060
'...Mr. Wadia's house is
now haunted by some evil spirit.'

135
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,650
'I tried to tell you
this for a long time now.'

136
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,730
'But I could never muster the courage.'

137
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,020
'I don't know what to do.'

138
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:35,520
'I wish there was someone
who could save me from my problem.'

139
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,810
'I wish...'

140
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,940
Rose, for God sake, let's go.

141
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,690
We're getting late for college.

142
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,900
We'll miss our class.

143
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,350
Please Nafisa, just a little longer.

144
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,730
I am not content yet.

145
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,310
If we wait for your contented...

146
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
...then we'll have to
wait out here all day.

147
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,690
Let's go.

148
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,350
I don't understand...

149
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,650
...how can such beautiful
music not have any effect on you?

150
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,900
Don't you want to forget everything
and drown yourself in this music?

151
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,100
I don't...

152
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,690
I came here from Lahore to study Law...

153
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,600
...and not become a musician.

154
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,230
You can stay drowned in that music.

155
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,480
I am leaving.

156
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,060
Fine, let's go.

157
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,980
You've turned into
a bloody dictator instead.

158
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,560
I wish I was a dictator...

159
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,940
...then, I would've sentenced you to death
for making me miss class every day...

160
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,940
...because of that pianist.

161
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
Rose?

162
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,480
What's wrong? Why do you look so scared?

163
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,230
It happened again...like always.

164
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,560
Allah...

165
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,150
Who is it this time? What does she want?

166
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,900
God knows.

167
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,190
I don't understand
this thing that you do.

168
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,150
Every time it scares you
to the edge of your life.

169
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,270
And a couple of days later,
it's back to the same old thing again.

170
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,230
If I can see spirits, and talk to them...

171
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,400
...then, it's my mother who
should be blamed for it.

172
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,980
She passed her power to me before she died.

173
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,400
So let them come to you.

174
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,150
Let them try to talk to you.

175
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,020
Why do you help them, Rose?

176
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,440
Simply ignore...ignore them.

177
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,060
I cannot ignore them.

178
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,940
They are in much more
suffering than we are.

179
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,190
They keep wandering for centuries...

180
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,480
...with the burden of
their unfulfilled desires.

181
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,310
If I can help them
break free of their prison...

182
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,230
...then what is wrong in that?

183
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,310
The thing is Rose,
not every spirit is good.

184
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,150
Some spirits are so evil...

185
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,810
...that they can even kill you.

186
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,770
- And I fear that...
- I will die.

187
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,770
God...don't ever say that.

188
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,900
You know Nafisa, I believe Jesus
Christ sent us to earth to play a part

189
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,190
And until we don't play our part,
death cannot harm us.

190
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,230
And once we've done our part...

191
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,940
...then no matter how hard we try,
life cannot hold us back.

192
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,690
Then I will pray to Allah...

193
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,230
...that your part isn't over
for the next 100-200 years.

194
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,770
Wow...this is unbelievable.

195
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,150
- Didn't we get too emotional today?
- No.

196
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,590
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ...

197
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,880
...be gone if you're an unclean spirit.

198
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,880
If you want me to help you,
let the lamp flicker.

199
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,210
Once for 'no' and twice for 'yes'.

200
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,420
Is there something that
remains undone on this plane?

201
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,840
- Yes.
- Hello, are you, Mrs. Lily Lopez.

202
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,630
- Yes, I am.
- I have a message for you...

203
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,130
- ...from your husband.
- What?

204
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,300
Yes, of course.
Don't try to be so naive.

205
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,710
- Shut up.
- Fine, I'll shut up.

206
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Whenever you go to London,
I feel very lonely.

207
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,550
Why couldn't you fall for a local boy?

208
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,960
What to do?

209
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,550
Our love's just budding.

210
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,000
And you know,
Salim gets so restless without me.

211
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,170
He can't focus on his medical studies.

212
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,840
Ohh, this damn love.

213
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,500
The things it makes one do.

214
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,590
Time for the train to arrive.
I'll leave.

215
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,960
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Take care.

216
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,630
Bye.

217
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,630
Rose?

218
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,590
I am Ayush.

219
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,460
Ayush Asthana.

220
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,800
I know who you are.

221
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,380
You're the Indian boy who plays piano...

222
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,960
...down at the Wadia Manor, don't you?

223
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,250
Yes, that's me.

224
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,710
And you can talk to me in Hindi.

225
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,460
My father was British,
but my mother was an Indian.

226
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,590
Oh, I see...

227
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,920
- You don't look like...
- An Indian?

228
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,300
Yes.

229
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,550
What to say?

230
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,460
The British think I am Indian...

231
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,800
...and the Indian think I am British.

232
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,210
And I think you're the
solution to all my troubles.

233
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,550
What?

234
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,920
I am the solution to your troubles?

235
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,380
I read about you in the newspaper.

236
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,710
Oh, I see...

237
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,800
- So you're in that kind of trouble.
- Yes.

238
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,170
If you don't mind,
can we talk about this tomorrow?

239
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,500
It's getting dark.

240
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,340
And, if I wait any longer...

241
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,000
...then, I won't be
able to find my way home.

242
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,460
Ohh...

243
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,920
Just a minute.

244
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,500
May I show you the way...

245
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,050
...then, tomorrow you
can do the same for me.

246
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,170
Come.

247
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,590
So tell me,
what kind of trouble are you in?

248
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,630
- Well...actually, the place where I live.
- Wadia Manor.

249
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Yes...Wadia Manor.

250
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,710
The terrible things that are occurring there...

251
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,920
...cannot be possible by any human being.

252
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,300
Sometimes I wonder these old homes...

253
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:36,500
...must have seen so many tragedies,
bad incidents, sorrows, and evil deeds.

254
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,380
There might be any number of secrets
and stories hidden behind those walls.

255
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,340
That's why I came to you.

256
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,500
Because you know these things.
You believe in them.

257
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,750
You have faith.

258
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,590
I need your help in getting
rid of whatever is in that house.

259
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,960
It's not easy to do that.

260
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,670
Facing these unclean spirits
can be really difficult.

261
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,250
They are unsatisfied spirits.

262
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,710
These souls have an
unfulfilled wish or desire.

263
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,380
I see...

264
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,710
Let's do one thing.

265
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,130
I'll come over to Wadia Manor
tomorrow after college at 3 pm.

266
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,420
Once I inspect the house,
I'll know what to do next.

267
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,300
Thank you, that will be wonderful.

268
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,210
Well, here we are.

269
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,210
This is where I live.

270
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,840
Thank you for showing me the way.

271
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,670
And, thank you very much
for agreeing to help me.

272
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,300
Take this light with you.

273
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,550
Because you show the light to everyone.

274
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,800
Very charming.

275
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,920
See you at 3 pm tomorrow.

276
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,210
What have you felt?

277
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,880
What do you see or hear?

278
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,300
It always begins in the same manner.

279
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,800
A very strange sound.

280
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,130
Mild, but high-pitched.

281
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,000
But, when I follow that sound...

282
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,170
...it feels like that sound is
coming from outside this house.

283
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:05,840
When I look out the window,
I see a white light.

284
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,670
Coming towards me.

285
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,170
White light?

286
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,420
Yeah.

287
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,880
After that,
anything can happen.

288
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,000
Lights turns off.

289
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,090
Doors start to open and close.

290
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,590
Windows start clattering.

291
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,880
Sometimes I hear a woman's scream.

292
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,210
And the last time I saw something
written on the wall in blood.

293
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,840
Really? In blood?

294
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,000
- Can I see it?
- Sure

295
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,210
Oh my, God! I've never
seen anything like this before.

296
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,500
You were right. This is dried up blood.

297
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,590
Yes, definitely.

298
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,460
Did someone suddenly die out here?

299
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,710
Before time.

300
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,460
Maybe.

301
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,210
Hard to say.

302
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,630
There's one thing...

303
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,250
Can you hear that?

304
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,630
Someone's playing the piano.

305
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,840
Is there anyone else
in this house other than you?

306
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,170
Oh, God...

307
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,630
It's a piece of glass with blood on it.

308
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,500
I've seen this before.

309
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,170
One thing is certain.

310
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,840
The spirit infesting your house is evil.

311
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,340
But try to remember.

312
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,750
Maybe you did something...unintentionally.

313
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,840
Or maybe an incident you don't remember.

314
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,170
Doesn't matter how small.

315
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,210
Even small things can have
a big importance in the spirit world.

316
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,880
I'll try to think since
you're insisting so much.

317
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,920
But as far as I remember...

318
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,960
...there was nothing that
would lead to such a situation.

319
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,670
Then we have only one choice.

320
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,420
In order to get rid
of any unclean spirit...

321
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,300
...we must first find out what it wants.

322
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,550
- But, how are we going to do it?
- Not us, God will do it.

323
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,630
It's called an intervention.

324
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,090
We can start tonight if you want.

325
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,050
Yes, of course.

326
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,170
I mean, please.

327
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,670
Do not bring us to the test

328
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,420
...but deliver us from the evil.

329
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,710
Amen.

330
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,090
Lord, grant me the courage
and the strength to fight this evil.

331
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,160
Can I ask you something?

332
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,950
What's the connection
between 3 am and evil spirits?

333
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,120
It's said that evil spirits
are the strongest at that hour.

334
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,870
That's true.

335
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,000
When Jesus Christ was crucified...

336
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,750
...his spirit left his
body at 3 in the afternoon.

337
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,080
So that's believed to be
the holiest hour of the day.

338
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,200
At 3 pm.

339
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,080
And that's why devil
chose exactly the opposite.

340
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,040
3 am.

341
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,540
Then was Jesus led up
the filth into the wilderness...

342
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,250
...to be tempted of the devil.

343
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,500
And when he had fasted
forty days and forty nights...

344
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,500
...he was afterward and hunger.

345
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,500
And when the tempter came to him,
he said...

346
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,750
If thou be the son of God,
command that these stones be made bread.

347
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,080
But he answered and said, it is written...

348
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,950
Man shall not live by bread alone...

349
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,830
...but by every word preceded
out of the mouth of...

350
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,790
...out of the mouth of God.

351
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,450
Then the Devil taketet
him into the holy city...

352
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,830
...and seteth him at
the pinnacle of the temple.

353
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,000
And saidth...

354
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,450
And saidth on to him.

355
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,410
"If thou be the son of God,
cast thy self down."

356
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,830
"For it is written,
he shall give his angels charge..."

357
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,080
"And in their hands,
they shall bear thee up."

358
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,540
"Lest any time thou sky for a..."

359
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,080
"...against the stone."

360
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,080
Jesus said onto him, it is written...

361
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,660
Why are you hiding from me?

362
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,370
Why are you hiding from me?

363
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,660
Rose.

364
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,500
Rose.

365
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,580
"You're my hope..."

366
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,330
"...take me along with you."

367
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,830
"Be my destiny..."

368
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,370
"...and come closer to me."

369
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:25,870
"Be my angel..."

370
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:32,620
"...you're the sky to my stars."

371
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:39,870
"My darkness, and the light,

372
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:46,830
"...everything I own,
are all for you."

373
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:53,750
"Let's walk with me in your arms."

374
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,790
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

375
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,330
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

376
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,830
"O my beautiful tomorrow."

377
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,040
'Don't worry, I am absolutely fine.'

378
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,290
'Its just a little bruise.'

379
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,830
'I didn't want to wake you up. Rose.'

380
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
If you came here to find out...

381
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,540
...whether I was scared
by last night's incident and fled...

382
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,250
...then don't worry,
I don't give up easily.

383
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,330
And, now I am even more determined.

384
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,080
I didn't come here because
I doubt your courage.

385
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,540
I came here because
I'm ashamed of my cowardice.

386
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,410
Cowardice? I didn't understand.

387
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,000
Read this letter, you will understand.

388
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,040
'Rose, you kept asking
me and I kept lying to you.'

389
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,950
'But the truth is;
I am the reason why...'

390
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:33,330
'...this house is infested
with an evil spirit.'

391
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:40,000
'It all began when I
had just arrived in England.'

392
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,620
'First it was only a handful of people...'

393
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,040
'...but soon the entire village,
and also the neighboring villages...'

394
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,200
'...started coming over to my home.'

395
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,370
'And I thought if I can
make some money out of it...'

396
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,540
'...it'll make life easier for me.'

397
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,750
'I was completely wrong to think that.'

398
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,080
Hello.

399
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:18,000
Aren't you the caretaker
who my uncle speaks so highly of?

400
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,040
That pianist.

401
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,950
Yes, that's me.

402
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,040
- And you?
- Meher.

403
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,580
Meher Wadia.

404
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,580
Mr. Wadia's only niece.

405
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,700
And, the sole heir to this property.

406
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:39,040
Anyway, it took me all
day to get her from London.

407
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,660
So exhausting.

408
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,660
My bags are in the car outside.

409
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,290
Go and get them.

410
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,160
Go.

411
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,160
Quick.

412
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,410
By all means, ma'am.

413
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,870
Ma'am, which room would
you like me to keep these bags?

414
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,200
Come here.

415
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,910
Someone from this small
town wrote a small letter...

416
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,580
...and revealed a big secret to me.

417
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,660
I've heard that you play
the piano to make money.

418
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:37,500
No need to lie, because
I know my information is correct.

419
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,040
Yes...I play the piano.

420
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,160
But, not the way you think.

421
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,660
- I...
- No need for any clarification.

422
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,370
Firstly, my uncle trusted you.

423
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,950
He gave you the
responsibility of this house.

424
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,200
And you...

425
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,790
You turned this place into a brothel.

426
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:59,950
You... You are mistaken.

427
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,870
I understand everything.

428
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,500
I can tell the difference
between right and wrong.

429
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,080
Do you know how many generations
we've had this house for?

430
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,910
It's our identity, our pride.

431
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,500
And you used it to make a few bucks.

432
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,500
You let strangers come inside the house.

433
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,620
Imagine how disappointed
my uncle will be when he finds out?

434
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:25,160
And your father, Mr.
Asthana, he will lose his job.

435
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,120
Look, I beg you.

436
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,250
I made a big mistake, ma'am.

437
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,120
I...I...I just want to learn music,
that's it.

438
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:40,950
And, my father shouldn't be
punished for my mistakes, it's not fair.

439
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,620
I...I beg of you.

440
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,870
Please don't tell Mr. Wadia anything.

441
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,080
I...will... I'll do anything you say.

442
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,000
Please.

443
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,040
Let me see.

444
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,290
Play for me tonight.

445
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,000
Let me have a private concert.

446
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,160
If you can play for the entire town...

447
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,330
...then you can definitely
play for me. Right.

448
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,370
And, if I like your music...

449
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,700
...then I will forgive you.

450
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,790
I...I won't give you a chance to complain.

451
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,450
We'll see...

452
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,370
I mean, listen.

453
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,410
I never had wine before.

454
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm sure you didn't. But you will now.

455
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,950
Come on.

456
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,500
Where are we going?

457
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,660
To nice people.

458
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,410
It's slow poison, my dear pianist.

459
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,120
It'll take more than ten hours for you to die.

460
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,040
And...what's interesting is that...

461
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:22,410
...the nice people,
that live here, will try to save you.

462
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,290
But they won't succeed.

463
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,450
It's going to be so much fun.

464
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,160
I'll enjoy watching their helplessness.

465
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,910
I am going to enjoy it so much.

466
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
It's going to be so much fun.

467
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,700
So much fun.

468
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,370
'I don't know why
Meher wanted to kill me.'

469
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:04,330
'But, even though unintentionally,
I killed Meher Wadia.'

470
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,290
'I had killed Mr. Wadia's niece.'

471
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,370
'What had I done?'

472
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:14,750
I could see my life getting
engulfed in pitch black darkness.'

473
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,500
'I was assured that
the police will find me...'

474
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,580
'...and lock me up for many years.'

475
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,160
I lived with that fear day and night.'

476
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,790
'I was so scared that...'

477
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,200
'...I even stopped going
to the music school.'

478
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,410
'I would hide in my house all day.'

479
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,330
'But days passed, and nothing happened.'

480
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,950
'When I returned to the accident site...'

481
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,950
'...the police had recovered
the car and the body.'

482
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,330
'Then why couldn't they get to me.'

483
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,620
'I kept waiting for Mr. Wadia's letter filled with anger.'

484
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,330
'But that letter never arrived.'

485
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,370
'Moreover, there was no news about
Meher Wadia's death in the newspapers.'

486
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,120
'My fear lessened...'

487
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,620
'...and I finally realized that
maybe no one saw me with Meher.'

488
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:11,120
'And maybe that's why no one knew
that I was involved in Meher's death.'

489
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,120
'But Meher did.'

490
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,620
'What she couldn't achieve
while she was alive...'

491
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,620
'...she's trying to get to it now.'

492
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,700
'I am sure this is
Meher Wadia's spirit.'

493
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,830
'And that's the truth.'

494
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,370
'But I am not telling you
all this so you can help me again.'

495
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,160
'I am telling you this because...'

496
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:43,370
'...you can find the heart to
forgive me for putting your life in danger.'

497
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,450
'Ayush.'

498
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,080
What the hell Nafisa?

499
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:02,410
Not one, not two, but three truths.

500
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:08,160
You know his, but he doesn't know yours.

501
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,290
And you two don't know mine.

502
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,580
Nafisa!

503
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,450
Nafisa!

504
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,120
Rose.

505
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:22,870
What's the matter?

506
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,000
Why do you look so scared?

507
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:40,950
I told you someday you'll come
face-to-face with an evil spirit.

508
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,200
My prediction has come true.

509
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,250
Now your life is in danger.

510
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,750
Please, Rose.

511
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,080
For God's sake stop
fighting with these spirits.

512
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,950
You cannot face these
evil spirits alone.

513
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
They will kill you, Rose.

514
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
You're not wrong, Nafisa.

515
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,950
But, I cannot desert
this battle in the middle...

516
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,160
...or give up easily.

517
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,000
Even if I have to give my life for it.

518
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,700
Why? What is compelling you?

519
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,450
Who are you risking your life for, Rose?

520
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,580
- There's only one such guy.
- Who?

521
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,040
The one who lives in Wadia Manor.

522
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,580
Allah...

523
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,290
So that's the reason.

524
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,540
Is he in big trouble?

525
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,830
Well, I can say that in all my years...

526
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,080
...I've never faced such
an evil spirit before.

527
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,950
So what will you do now?

528
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:53,160
First I must do what
I should've done long ago.

529
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,870
I read your truth.

530
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,080
And, I understand why
you don't want my help.

531
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,910
But, even I have a truth...

532
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,000
...which compels me to help you.

533
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:26,000
And just like you,
it's difficult for me to say it.

534
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,660
So...

535
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,660
I was only five when my mother passed away.

536
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:46,200
And she passed on her
power to see spirits, to me.

537
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,620
Then World War one happened...

538
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,580
...and my father lost
his life on the Front.

539
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,580
I was orphaned.

540
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,950
And I was so unfortunate.

541
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,660
I could see spirits...

542
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,450
...but, I couldn't see my own parents.

543
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,870
I was alone but now I was also lonely.

544
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,950
I had no reason to live.

545
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:15,000
That day,
I was about to give up my life, when...

546
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,450
"Wait, O heart..."

547
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:24,040
"...find a reason to live."

548
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,700
"Don't let sorrows scare you..."

549
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:34,080
"...and find your happiness."

550
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,200
"Fall in love..."

551
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,040
"Let your feelings soar..."

552
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:46,330
"Love is the cure for every sorrow."

553
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,200
"Wait, O heart..."

554
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:04,870
"...find a reason to live."

555
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:08,700
"Don't let sorrows scare you..."

556
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:14,080
"...and find your happiness."

557
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,790
"Fall in love..."

558
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,160
"Let your feelings soar..."

559
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:23,790
"Love is the cure for every sorrow."

560
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,330
"Hear me..."

561
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,370
"Hear me..."

562
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,200
"Hear me O heart."

563
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,700
"Hear me..."

564
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,040
"Hear me..."

565
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,830
"Hear me O heart."

566
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,040
Hello.

567
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:15,120
The piano is out of tune.
Took a day off.

568
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:18,250
That's alright. Another day perhaps.

569
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,750
Hey...

570
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,080
Now that you're here, how about
some music to take the pain away.

571
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,700
"I am your love... try to feel me."

572
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:40,160
"Its me who beats in your heart."

573
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:45,040
"You'll realize when you'll touch me..."

574
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,370
"...I am that moment that passed."

575
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:54,500
"For the darkness that dwells in your eyes..."

576
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:59,040
"...I am your dawn."

577
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:03,910
"I am the ray of light waiting for you..."

578
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,580
"...behind the mist."

579
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:11,830
"Find what you've lost..."

580
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:16,540
"...I am your path leading the way."

581
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,250
"Hear me..."

582
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:21,330
"Hear me..."

583
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:26,160
"Hear me O heart."

584
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,540
"Hear me..."

585
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,750
"Hear me..."

586
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,450
"Hear me O heart."

587
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,120
What language is he singing in?

588
01:00:58,410 --> 01:00:59,700
I think its Hindi.

589
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,040
But what does it matter?
Music is music.

590
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,120
That's true.

591
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:14,080
"I am your destiny,
weave me in your words."

592
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,910
"How do I call you out..."

593
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,160
"...because I am voiceless."

594
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,290
"Hear me in your heartbeat."

595
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,660
"I am life...live me."

596
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:32,750
"I am your tear, drink me."

597
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:37,700
"I am shattered like a dream..."

598
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,950
"...and scattered around,
come and pick me up."

599
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:46,200
"I'm the one dwelling in you..."

600
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:51,000
"...and you're my image."

601
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,330
"Hear me..."

602
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,580
"Hear me..."

603
01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:00,330
"Hear me O heart."

604
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,790
"Hear me..."

605
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:04,950
"Hear me..."

606
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,950
"Hear me O heart."

607
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,660
'When you came to
me asking for my help...'

608
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:13,330
'...I knew you didn't recognize me.'

609
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:16,910
'I was just an unknown
face amongst the crowd...'

610
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,830
'...who would come to listen to your music.'

611
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,410
'But for me, you're more than God.'

612
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,250
'Your music gave me new hope.'

613
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,160
'Showed me the path to live.'

614
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,040
'My life is indebted to you Ayush.'

615
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,910
'You became the purpose
of my aimless life.'

616
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
'Maybe that's why your
music didn't let me die.'

617
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:49,950
'So that I can keep
you and your music alive.'

618
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,870
Oh my, God. What is this?

619
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:26,910
How did this happen?

620
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:29,200
Doesn't it pain?

621
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,500
What do you keep writing all day?

622
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:39,700
HCH/66.

623
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,580
- What does it mean?
- I don't know myself.

624
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:53,410
Feels like someone's
written it on my fingers.

625
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,500
And I try to get rid of this feeling...

626
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,700
...by writing it on the paper.

627
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,080
But...

628
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,040
No matter how many times I write it...

629
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,370
...I can't get rid of this feeling.

630
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,160
It stays.

631
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
The harder we try to solve this riddle...

632
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,370
...the more confusing it gets.

633
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:15,120
What I don't understand...

634
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,790
...even if we try to solve this puzzle,
where do we start?

635
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,620
Maybe the place where it all started.

636
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:24,910
What?

637
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,040
Remember you said there
are many doors in this house...

638
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,660
...which you haven't opened yet.

639
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:31,000
And you don't know what's behind it.

640
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:32,620
Yes.

641
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,500
Then we must search this house first.

642
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,750
Who knows what secrets are
hidden behind those closed doors.

643
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,910
So this is Meher Wadia.

644
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,950
How is this possible?

645
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:47,040
Rose...this isn't the Meher Wadia
who came to meet me.

646
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:50,830
That is not her.

647
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,200
But...according to this photo...

648
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,830
...she is Meher Wadia, Mr. Wadia's niece.

649
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,040
Then who was the girl...who came
to meet me posing as Meher Wadia.

650
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,750
And tried to kill me.

651
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:23,210
A girl, who we know nothing about...

652
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,550
...comes here posing as Meher Wadia. Why?

653
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:32,630
She wants to kill you. Why?

654
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,300
She wants to prove something
to some good people.

655
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:37,670
Who are these good people?

656
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:43,130
Even if we find out
anything about that girl...

657
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,170
...where will that get us?

658
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,630
These evil spirits
Never reveal themselves.

659
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,300
They hide out of sight.

660
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:52,670
They stay in the dark
and fulfill their desires.

661
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,960
In order to get rid of them...

662
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:58,630
...we must find out who
they are and what they want.

663
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:02,590
Just like we must catch
a thief to stop him from stealing.

664
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,170
There must be some way
to find out who she was.

665
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:11,800
Hold on.

666
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,090
Bags!

667
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,880
She brought her bags here.

668
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,050
And I hid them.

669
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,300
Where are the bags?

670
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,920
It's an Indian passport.

671
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,710
Issued in Karachi in 1919.

672
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,880
Whoever she is, hasn't been
living here for more than 2 years.

673
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:51,920
But the problem is...

674
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,300
...this passport isn't
enough to identify the person.

675
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,590
There is a way.

676
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,050
If she's an Indian...

677
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,590
...then her ship must have
docked at South Hampton.

678
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,420
We can find information out there.

679
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,210
That's correct.

680
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,210
There's an immigration officer
in South Hampton who I helped out.

681
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,300
Maybe he can help us now.

682
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,460
There's a train which leaves
at 10 o'clock tonight for South Hampton.

683
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,130
I'll meet you at the station.

684
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:32,090
"Ringa-Ringa Roses."

685
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:37,300
"Pocket full of poses."

686
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,090
"I tease you..."

687
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,170
"I tease you..."

688
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:46,300
"We all fall down."

689
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:51,590
"Ringa-Ringa Roses."

690
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,800
"Pocket full of poses."

691
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,800
"I tease you..."

692
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,420
Oh my, God.

693
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,170
Come with me.

694
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,460
Exact same face.

695
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,590
Warning.

696
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,300
This spirit is trying to warn us.

697
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,170
See this.

698
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,300
It's what was written
on the mirror that day.

699
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:25,300
It's written in English down here.

700
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,210
"First you go Black, then you die."

701
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,250
I know what this painting
is trying to say.

702
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:39,130
It's a painting of the plague...

703
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,300
...which is also called the "Black Death".

704
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,380
The year 1347.
The epidemic had spread in Mongolia.

705
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,050
That's why...the Mongolian face...

706
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,670
...and, it's also written in Mongolian.

707
01:11:55,170 --> 01:12:00,050
Later in 1348,
it spread to England through some sailor.

708
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:02,420
The plague was so dangerous...

709
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:07,130
Anyone infected by it didn't
survive for more than 3 days.

710
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:08,960
Then it's a very clear warning.

711
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,300
Look...

712
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:13,920
Look at this moon.

713
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:18,170
And down here, it has no reflection.

714
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:24,050
And this face, it's completely intact.

715
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:28,380
And here, it's turned
completely black in the reflection.

716
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:33,880
That spirit is trying to tell me...

717
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,500
...that, I have only three days to live.

718
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,800
Three days? What nonsense.

719
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:43,920
"First you go Black, then you die."

720
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,840
Look...

721
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:59,130
Like I said, that spirit is
giving these black marks on my body.

722
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:08,000
Look at this moon.

723
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,420
Three days later is the no-moon night.

724
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,590
In three nights my entire
body will turn black.

725
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:26,590
First I will turn Black,
then I will die.

726
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,000
I will be dead.

727
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,300
Do you get it?

728
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,500
We've lost, Rose.

729
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,960
We've lost to that spirit.

730
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:40,630
We can never figure out in three days...

731
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,710
...who that girl really was.

732
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,800
Or why does she want revenge from me?

733
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,670
We'll keep going around in circles,
round and round...

734
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:52,460
We've lost! There's no way.

735
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:57,090
You're giving up! Tell me.

736
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,840
Are you giving up?

737
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:01,250
Before you give up, you should know that...

738
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,340
...death itself gives up.

739
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,300
Do you know to whom?

740
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:08,800
To the girl who loves you so much.

741
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:11,960
I am standing between
you and death, Ayush.

742
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,500
Death cannot dare
to take you away from me!

743
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:20,880
"You dwell in my breath..."

744
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,920
"...I am your journey."

745
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:31,670
"Don't ever leave me..."

746
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:35,960
"...I am your abode."

747
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:56,130
"Love me a little more than you do."

748
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,210
"Without you...I've nothing."

749
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:07,130
"You are my world."

750
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:12,630
"My hopes...my belief."

751
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:18,090
"You are my sky."

752
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,550
Hello.

753
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:39,300
My dearie,
nice night for a dreamy drive, aye.

754
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:40,460
Yes, sir.

755
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:42,920
Just need some petrol
to make the dream come true.

756
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,920
Lady have a sense of humor as well.

757
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,210
That's a good thing.

758
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,550
I'll have to get you
the spare key for the pump.

759
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:54,130
Wouldn't want your dreamy drive
to end up in the middle of nowhere...

760
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,210
...due to an empty petrol tank.

761
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,300
Hello.

762
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,960
Are you okay?

763
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:22,050
Damnit.

764
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:25,300
Ayush, careful.

765
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,920
Rose, behind you.

766
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,460
Forget the key, let's get out of here.

767
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,460
Petrol tank, open the petrol tank.

768
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:30,220
She won't let us reach
our destination so easily.

769
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,810
But by trying to stop us she has
proved that we are on the right path.

770
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:11,210
Rose, this is the girl.

771
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:14,920
She came posing as Meher Wadia.

772
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,500
We found what we were looking for.

773
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:20,800
Name: Dina Shaw.

774
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,210
Nationality: Indian.

775
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:27,050
She's been invited from India
to study at the University of York.

776
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,300
The University of York?

777
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,090
There's been a bit of flooding.

778
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,130
The bridge down the road,
there's some work going on it.

779
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,420
But I need to get to York fast.

780
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:58,880
Well, My lady...on this broken bridge...

781
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,550
...you're going nowhere,
let me assure you.

782
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,800
The earliest this road will
be open will be early tomorrow morning.

783
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,880
You better off staying
at the inn close-by.

784
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,340
Until morning comes.

785
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:08,590
That's what I would do.

786
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:32,110
Just one night more.

787
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,240
One night is left.

788
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:38,950
- And after that...
- One night it all we need...

789
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,530
...to defeat that spirit.

790
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,610
Do you really believe
so much in yourself?

791
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:52,110
Not in myself. But in my love.

792
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:55,490
Since God has blessed me with such love...

793
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:58,450
...He will show me the
way to keep it alive.

794
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:12,610
Whether God exists or not,
I will only know after I am dead.

795
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:19,320
But fortunately I met one of his angels.

796
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:22,860
Isn't this so strange?

797
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,570
Thanks to the darkness,
I found my ray of light.

798
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,530
You know how to impress with your words.

799
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,360
But it's true as well.

800
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,110
I don't know how
I am going to thank you.

801
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:45,200
Well, there's no thank you in love.

802
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,150
But if you really want to,
there is one way.

803
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:54,240
I see... How?

804
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,780
When this phase is over...

805
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:01,240
...I want you to write a song for me.

806
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,320
With all your love.

807
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:12,490
Why do you think...
I haven't done that already.

808
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,200
Really?

809
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,400
Yes, ma'am.

810
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:23,110
Then sing it for me...now.

811
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,200
Listen.

812
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,820
Not like this, sing it properly.

813
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:49,030
"Stay..."

814
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,950
"Stay..."

815
01:23:53,400 --> 01:24:00,320
"Stay O night for me..."

816
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:27,200
"Stay..."

817
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:30,990
"Stay..."

818
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:37,490
"Stay O night for me..."

819
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:52,530
"So two bodies can turn into one soul."

820
01:24:53,110 --> 01:25:00,280
"The crescent moon on the horizon..."

821
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:07,450
"...let it shine in my eyes all night long."

822
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:14,740
"O clouds, heed my request."

823
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:21,450
"Don't let my stars
plunge into darkness."

824
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,950
"Stay..."

825
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,610
"Stay..."

826
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:35,240
"Stay O night for me..."

827
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:49,240
"So two bodies can turn into one soul."

828
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:27,570
"Even death can't come close to me..."

829
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:34,490
"...let's hideaway some
strands of life."

830
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:41,990
"live an eternity
in this one night."

831
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:48,070
"Let's not miss out
on living this life."

832
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,360
"Stay..."

833
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:55,280
"Stay..."

834
01:26:55,900 --> 01:27:01,780
"Stay O night for me..."

835
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:16,070
"So two bodies can turn into one soul."

836
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,490
Ayush.

837
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,780
Ayush.

838
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:35,740
Excuse me.

839
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:39,450
I need you to unlock the door for me.

840
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:42,740
Hello.

841
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:50,490
Hello.

842
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,200
Ayush.

843
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:20,570
Hello.

844
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:29,700
Looking for the keys
to get out of the house.

845
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,700
Come dine with us first.

846
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:25,950
It's me, Rose.

847
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:26,950
It's all right. It's me.

848
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:28,570
It's all a trap.

849
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:30,740
Right from the Police
roadblock to this hotel.

850
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,570
Everyone we met is already dead.

851
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,070
This spirit is trying to mislead us.

852
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:38,070
Trying to stop us from
getting to our destination.

853
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:39,900
It's trying to delay us.

854
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:42,740
She knows...that we
have only one night left.

855
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:44,570
We must get out of here. Come on.

856
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:47,700
Come on.

857
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,200
Hold this.

858
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:14,200
- Dina Shaw, you said.
- Yes.

859
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:17,900
- Was she not the Indian student?
- Yes, that's the one.

860
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:20,360
Yes, I remember that girl.

861
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:21,780
She was a bright student.

862
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,740
Fell prey to ill health.

863
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:28,150
I believe she had a hole in her heart.

864
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:29,740
Poor girl.

865
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:31,950
It was late one night
when she really took ill...

866
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:35,740
...and I recall that a fellow professor
and I escorted her to the hospital.

867
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:38,700
But she hasn't returned.

868
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,110
It's very odd.

869
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:42,740
Thank you so much for the information,
professor...

870
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:44,990
...but if I may ask,
which hospital was it?

871
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,490
York General Hospital.

872
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:09,990
Oh my, God.

873
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:12,110
Can it be?

874
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,200
What? What can be?

875
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:17,650
Ayush, wait here.

876
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:19,070
- I'll be right back.
- But why?

877
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:21,150
Rose. Tell me.

878
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:22,900
Rose.

879
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:33,780
Ayush, do you remember the place...

880
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:35,860
...where Meher took
you after she poisoned you?

881
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,990
- Do you remember that place?
- Wait a minute, Rose.

882
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,360
Tell me what's going on?

883
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:41,570
Please Ayush,
I will tell you everything.

884
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:45,450
- But do you remember that place?
- Yes, of course, I do.

885
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:47,360
Then let's go,
we're running out of time.

886
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,150
Hurry up, Ayush.

887
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,530
Are you sure she brought you here?

888
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:11,240
Yes, I remember clearly.

889
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:13,490
But tell me what is it?

890
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:18,610
Ayush, we thought that spirit
is punishing you for your mistake.

891
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,110
But we were wrong.

892
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:25,360
Everything that's been happening
with you isn't your fault.

893
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:34,280
It's mine!

894
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,030
When I joined college...

895
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,900
...I had to leave my home
in Manchester and come to York.

896
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,700
Here, I started living with
Nafisa in her boarding house.

897
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:52,360
I knew Nafisa since our school days.

898
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:55,950
But I also met Vasudha there.

899
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:59,650
Even she lived with
us in that same boarding house.

900
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:01,280
She was an Indian.

901
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:05,490
Her father was some
rich barrister in Delhi.

902
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:09,070
Actually, it wasn't just Nafisa and me...

903
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:13,650
...but even Vasudha would
come over to hear your music.

904
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:40,400
The music's playing on that side...

905
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:42,280
...what are you looking for on this side?

906
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:48,700
I am seeing that this girl
is really in love with the pianist.

907
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,320
I have no idea.

908
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:57,650
How can she love someone
whom she never met, or talked to?

909
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:02,200
Maybe its love at first sight.

910
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:07,780
Or in this case,
love at first musical note.

911
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,570
You're not smiling.

912
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:33,740
What's the matter?

913
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:37,240
This has to stop, Vasudha.

914
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:43,650
This... You and me, this can't go on.

915
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:45,990
Stop?

916
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,950
I love you.

917
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,700
- You know that right.
- Yes.

918
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:56,450
And I love you too,
but you know I am married.

919
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:59,780
And this stealing behind
Julia all the time...

920
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:01,320
...it's making me very-very guilty.

921
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:03,700
Stealing behind Julia?

922
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,610
Are you even listening
to yourself, Richard?

923
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:09,070
That woman doesn't love you.

924
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,530
She doesn't even care about you.

925
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:14,030
And you still want
to feel guilty about us.

926
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:16,900
I cannot be like Julia, Vasudha.

927
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:18,900
I am not her.

928
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:22,700
I cannot be insensitive or uncaring...

929
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:24,110
...even if she is.

930
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,070
I am not the kind of
person to do the wrong thing.

931
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,320
I won't.

932
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,900
I am really sorry about this.

933
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:10,150
Come on Vasudha, what is wrong with you?

934
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,240
It's been a week.

935
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:16,950
You don't sleep or eat.

936
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,360
And even stopped coming to the college.

937
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,240
Get up.

938
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,950
Get up and come with us.

939
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:27,280
I don't want to go anywhere.
Please leave.

940
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:32,860
- But Vasudha...
- Just go. Please go.

941
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:37,030
We knew from Vasudha's condition...

942
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:40,200
...that something awful happened
between Richard and her.

943
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:47,320
Vasudha didn't talk to us or
step out of her room for many days...

944
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:49,110
...nor did she eat?

945
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,360
And then one day...

946
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:55,860
...she looked as happy
as she was sad before.

947
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,070
Salim and his poems, I tell you.

948
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,110
- Guess what my dear friends.
- What?

949
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:06,360
Richard proposed to me.

950
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:08,110
And I said yes.

951
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:10,780
I am getting married.

952
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:11,900
What?

953
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:14,240
But Richard...

954
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,820
I mean isn't he already married?

955
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:17,990
Then...

956
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:20,400
Well, not anymore.

957
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,860
His wife left him.

958
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:26,030
She left a letter behind for
him and broke off their relationship.

959
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:29,860
He's single now, and he's all mine.

960
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:34,200
Oh my, God. This is amazing news.

961
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:35,900
I am so happy for you.

962
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:37,990
This is so beautiful.

963
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:40,570
Vasu, just what you wanted. Yes.

964
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:46,070
- Fabulous party.
- Well, I'm getting married to a fabulous girl.

965
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:49,990
It's the least I can do
to celebrate our engagement...

966
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:51,400
...is throw a fabulous party.

967
01:40:53,070 --> 01:40:54,780
You girls will have to excuse us.

968
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:58,530
I want to show my new
fiancée off to my friends.

969
01:40:58,610 --> 01:40:59,360
- Sure.
- Sure.

970
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:00,280
See you.

971
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:01,950
I'll just be back.

972
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:02,700
Sure.

973
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:05,860
Can I Introduce you to Vasudha!

974
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:31,400
Let's talk.

975
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,700
- Excuse me.
- Rose.

976
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:38,860
Rose, excuse me.

977
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:40,610
What's wrong?

978
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:43,740
Nafisa, I need to talk to you right now.

979
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:46,490
That's so nice of him.

980
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,320
What is it, Rose?

981
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:50,070
We must leave this party.

982
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:51,240
I cannot tell you here.

983
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:52,490
- Now?
- Come on.

984
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,000
Rose, but...

985
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:55,760
Stop it, Rose.

986
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,100
Just stop it.

987
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,220
What nonsense is this?

988
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,600
Richard's wife isn't dead.

989
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,220
She left him.

990
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:05,180
I know that.

991
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:09,600
But, everything I saw and
heard today cannot be a lie.

992
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:15,850
Julia's spirit told me
that Vasudha murdered her.

993
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:18,600
And, she even told me
where Vasudha buried her.

994
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:22,100
And...Vasudha even used our typewriter...

995
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:24,890
...to write a letter
to Richard as his wife.

996
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:28,010
And she wrote that she's leaving him...

997
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:30,260
...so that no one doubts
that she's been murdered.

998
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:32,260
Don't talk nonsense, Rose.

999
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:35,640
She's our Vasudha. Our Vasu...

1000
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,550
She can never kill anyone.

1001
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:41,100
And...it can be any typewriter, Rose.

1002
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,720
No, Nafisa.

1003
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,430
The letter 'N' of
our typewriter is smudged.

1004
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,890
And she said that the letter
'n' in that letter is also smudged.

1005
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:51,300
But why will Vasudha do such a thing?

1006
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:55,010
Because necessity can make
people do anything, Nafisa.

1007
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:59,140
Allah, this is terrible, Rose.

1008
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:02,350
What will we do now?

1009
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:11,510
Your wife also told me that the
note you found had a smudged 'n' in it...

1010
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:14,140
...which proves it was
written by my typewriter.

1011
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:16,350
You can try it if you want.

1012
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:38,600
You're right.

1013
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:40,760
The 'n' is smudged.

1014
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:45,260
This letter was written
with your typewriter.

1015
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:50,680
Tell me...where is my wife buried.

1016
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:52,930
Rose, Vasudha knows.

1017
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:56,260
She knows that you went to meet Richard.

1018
01:43:57,390 --> 01:43:58,260
How?

1019
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:01,220
She noticed that the
typewriter is missing.

1020
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:03,680
Then she made me tell her everything.

1021
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:05,470
And then...

1022
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:09,850
She said that she would
rather die than leave Richard.

1023
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,720
Oh my god.

1024
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:12,640
Where is she?

1025
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:15,350
She's locked herself in the room.

1026
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,600
- Vasudha.
- Vasu...

1027
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:21,260
Please open the door Vasudha.

1028
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:22,930
- Vasudha, please.
- Vasu, please.

1029
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:23,680
Talk to us.

1030
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:26,050
Don't be silly, Vasudha.
Please open the door.

1031
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:32,720
Rose...

1032
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,180
Vasudha!

1033
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:44,680
I'll call an ambulance.

1034
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:00,510
Today when you took me to that hospital...

1035
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,850
...I inquired and found out that...

1036
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:07,010
...the art student Dina
was admitted on the same day...

1037
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:10,470
...when we brought
Vasudha to the hospital.

1038
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:13,800
In the same ward, just two beds away.

1039
01:46:35,970 --> 01:46:38,220
You're paying for my mistakes.

1040
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:42,430
She wants to take
revenge by killing you.

1041
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:46,430
I am so sorry, Ayush. I am so sorry.

1042
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:49,720
Rose, it's not your fault.

1043
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:54,100
When she can kill someone's
wife in order to get her love...

1044
01:46:54,970 --> 01:46:58,010
...and give up her own
life after losing that love...

1045
01:46:58,390 --> 01:47:03,970
...and then tries to snatch your love away,
must be such a vile person.

1046
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:09,470
Think...she must be so full of hatred.

1047
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:15,640
But now she cannot harm you.

1048
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:19,140
We've seen her. We know who she is.

1049
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:24,050
I...I'll go with Nafisa
and bring Father Agustus here.

1050
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:28,430
He will bless this
house and exorcise it as well.

1051
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,510
Then everything will be fine.

1052
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,720
Okay?

1053
01:47:31,970 --> 01:47:32,970
Okay?

1054
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:34,350
Okay.

1055
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:41,180
Come soon, please.

1056
01:47:43,100 --> 01:47:44,600
I've grown used to you.

1057
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:49,760
Well, ...at least you've
developed some good habits.

1058
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:09,390
Who's there?

1059
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:11,680
Rose?

1060
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:57,890
Nafisa.

1061
01:48:57,970 --> 01:48:59,300
Nafisa.

1062
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:04,140
Oh my, God. Nafisa.

1063
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:07,300
How did this happen?

1064
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,430
Thank you.

1065
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,600
Oww...

1066
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:24,760
I think we will have
to stitch this one up.

1067
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:27,100
The gash looks pretty deep.

1068
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:28,510
Alright, doctor.

1069
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,430
Fortunately,
there were no internal injuries.

1070
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:36,100
Now, you can go home today,
but you must remember to rest.

1071
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:40,220
I'll arrange for the general
surgeon to look this up.

1072
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:42,180
Nurse, stitch her up.

1073
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:55,600
'What do you keep writing all the time?'

1074
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,800
'HCH/66.'

1075
01:49:58,510 --> 01:49:59,390
'What does it mean?'

1076
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:05,140
Excuse me, nurse.
What are these letters and numbers?

1077
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:07,970
HCH is the Holy Cross Hospital.

1078
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:09,510
And 19 is bed number.

1079
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,100
So where would bed number 66 be?

1080
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:14,350
Right down the corridor
and up the stairs.

1081
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,350
It should be ward 7.

1082
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:35,350
'Feels like someone's
written it on my fingers.'

1083
01:51:36,350 --> 01:51:40,100
'And I try to get rid of this
feeling by writing it on paper.'

1084
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,720
'A strange sound.'

1085
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:55,260
'Slow...but high pitched.'

1086
01:51:57,050 --> 01:52:00,350
- And how is bed 66?
- Just the same, doctor.

1087
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:16,640
Poor chap,
caught between life and death.

1088
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,850
Don't know how long the
body can survive like this.

1089
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:22,430
It's just deteriorating away.

1090
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:24,890
We're near the end of the month,
we need to make a decision.

1091
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:27,100
I have to remove the support systems.

1092
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:28,850
With the Bible and the
Cross placed next to him...

1093
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:32,550
...it's protected him all this time,
more so than the medicines.

1094
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:34,180
But...

1095
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,970
I think its time we take it away.

1096
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:41,640
You've been like a Florence
Nightingale to him.

1097
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:43,800
He's a lucky man.

1098
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:24,100
I understand everything now, Ayush.
Everything.

1099
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:30,510
Now no one can stop me from saving you.

1100
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:34,140
Not even Vasudha's hatred.

1101
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,350
Rose.

1102
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:46,930
Where were you?

1103
01:53:47,470 --> 01:53:48,430
Rose.

1104
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:50,300
- Rose.
- Come with me.

1105
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:53,260
- Rose.
- Just Come with me.

1106
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:55,010
Rose.

1107
01:53:55,890 --> 01:53:56,600
What?

1108
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:57,970
Just come, Nafisa.

1109
01:53:58,970 --> 01:54:00,100
Rose, what is it?

1110
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:00,970
What is the matter?

1111
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:03,260
Look closely at the
painting on the ceiling.

1112
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:12,010
It's believed that when our body sleeps,
our soul awakens.

1113
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:14,890
It also travels away from the body.

1114
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,720
But when that happens...

1115
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:23,220
...and white light keeps our
body and soul bounded together.

1116
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:27,050
As long as this bond exists...

1117
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:29,890
...the soul can re-enter the body.

1118
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:36,800
But if this bond breaks,
then the soul and body separate.

1119
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:41,850
The body can't survive without the soul...

1120
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:44,010
...and starts searching for it.

1121
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:48,720
I understand,
but why are you telling me this.

1122
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:53,300
Because the one I thought was Ayush,
is actually his soul.

1123
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:54,350
What?

1124
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:56,180
It has separated from its body.

1125
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,890
What are you saying?

1126
01:54:57,970 --> 01:55:02,220
The patient on bed number 66
of Holy Cross Hospital is Ayush.

1127
01:55:02,510 --> 01:55:03,970
He's in a coma.

1128
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:08,100
Vasudha's spirit knew what I didn't...

1129
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:14,260
...that's why whenever Ayush's
body tried to reconnect with his soul...

1130
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:17,100
...Vasudha's spirit intervened.

1131
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:19,720
She wants to keep the
body and soul separate...

1132
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:21,600
...and kill the body.

1133
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:25,550
And keep the soul in this darkness of hell.

1134
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:28,600
That's her revenge.

1135
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:32,430
Allah...but what will we do now?

1136
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:36,260
We must unite Ayush' body and soul.

1137
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:38,430
But it can't be that easy.

1138
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:41,220
Vasudha will never let it happen, Rose.

1139
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:45,430
I have a plan, but I'll need your help.

1140
01:55:48,430 --> 01:55:50,720
You must deliver this letter to Ayush.

1141
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:52,260
But not right now.

1142
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:54,470
A little before dawn.

1143
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:57,430
This is important. Please understand.

1144
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,640
A little before dawn?

1145
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:04,680
But Rose,
you said this is Ayush' last night.

1146
01:56:04,970 --> 01:56:07,100
Yes, I know. I know everything.

1147
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:10,140
Just do this for me,
and I'll handle the rest.

1148
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:11,680
What are you going to do, Rose?

1149
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:15,350
I must deliver Ayush's
body to his soul.

1150
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:16,640
But how?

1151
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:33,640
You die!

1152
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:57,140
Excuse me, sir.
Would you please open the door for me?

1153
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,050
Sir...

1154
01:57:58,260 --> 01:57:59,140
Are you listening to me?

1155
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:00,510
Will you please open the door for me?

1156
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:01,680
Sir...

1157
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:10,300
Rose.

1158
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:13,100
Rose.

1159
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,640
Ayush.

1160
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:15,930
Rose.

1161
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,390
Ayush.

1162
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:22,180
Rose.

1163
01:58:23,470 --> 01:58:24,220
Rose.

1164
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:26,850
Rose.

1165
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,220
Rose, please take me away from here.

1166
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:34,260
Rose, please.

1167
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:56,970
Rose...

1168
01:58:58,350 --> 01:58:59,260
Rose, please.

1169
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:02,100
Rose, please take me away from here.

1170
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:04,010
Please take me away from here.

1171
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:07,140
Ayush!

1172
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:10,600
Ayush, get up.

1173
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:12,970
Get up, Ayush.

1174
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:14,760
Get up, Ayush.

1175
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:47,510
You can see spirits, don't you?

1176
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:50,680
So it's difficult to hide from you.

1177
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:55,720
Here you go...now I am out in the open.

1178
01:59:56,890 --> 02:00:02,510
Now your lover's useless
body will fend against you.

1179
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:09,850
After tonight, Ayush's soul
will never unite with his body.

1180
02:00:10,890 --> 02:00:16,640
And this body won't let
you go out of here until dawn.

1181
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:23,470
Save your lover...if you can.

1182
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:49,540
Rose.

1183
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:54,870
I am coming, Rose.

1184
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,500
Rose.

1185
02:01:09,580 --> 02:01:11,080
Where are you?

1186
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:15,910
Rose, I need to tell
you something important.

1187
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:18,410
Rose.

1188
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:20,870
Rose.

1189
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:49,200
You're never safe from me.

1190
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:46,950
Surprise!

1191
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:51,910
Rose.

1192
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:58,250
I am gonna get you, Rose.

1193
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,080
You can run...

1194
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:09,250
...but you cannot hide, Rose.

1195
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:39,750
Hello, my lady.

1196
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:41,330
Do you need a taxi cab?

1197
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,580
Rose.

1198
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:50,250
I know that you're
hiding in the chapel.

1199
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:57,290
You'll save the soul,
but the body is in my possession.

1200
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,200
If you leave, the body will die.

1201
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,580
Come back, Rose.

1202
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:14,750
Come back.

1203
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:50,870
Good girl.

1204
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:52,450
Good girl.

1205
02:06:55,040 --> 02:07:01,410
I can see the pain on your
face which I once experienced.

1206
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,950
I'll damage this body so badly...

1207
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:14,870
...that there will be
no use in saving the soul.

1208
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,700
That hurt...didn't it?

1209
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:56,500
Now watch me cut your
Love to pieces, Rose.

1210
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:13,410
I will cut him down
slowly to small pieces...

1211
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:16,540
...just like you broke
my heart to pieces.

1212
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:28,660
What will you do now?

1213
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:32,620
How will you save Ayush?

1214
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:34,750
Tell me.

1215
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:47,660
With that?

1216
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:51,660
Really?

1217
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:31,250
I knew it was impossible
for me to make out alive from here.

1218
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:35,950
That's why I already made
arrangements to save Ayush.

1219
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:38,200
You're lying.

1220
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:41,500
I wanted to keep you
busy with me all night.

1221
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:43,290
And I succeeded.

1222
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:46,160
And as far as saving
Ayush's body goes...

1223
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:50,290
...now I'm going to do what
I couldn't when I was alive.

1224
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:52,700
Those who don't attain
salvation even after dying...

1225
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:54,950
...have to be forced to
cross over to the other side.

1226
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,910
You are coming with me.

1227
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:12,500
NO!

1228
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:15,450
NO!

1229
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:17,750
NO!

1230
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:18,950
NO!

1231
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:20,910
NO!

1232
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
NO!

1233
02:10:23,290 --> 02:10:25,000
NO!

1234
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:27,370
NO!

1235
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:35,580
Ayush.

1236
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:48,450
Ayush, I know I can't
see you or hear you.

1237
02:10:49,410 --> 02:10:55,910
But I know you can see me and hear me.

1238
02:10:56,950 --> 02:11:00,160
Rose has sent this letter for you.

1239
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,250
Read it.

1240
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,910
Rose, where were you?

1241
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:31,040
Rose, where were you?

1242
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,540
You must deliver this letter to Ayush.

1243
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:44,120
I must unite Ayush's
body to his soul.

1244
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:45,290
How?

1245
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:13,870
Rose.

1246
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:16,370
Rose.

1247
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:18,290
Rose.

1248
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:20,200
Rose.

1249
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:22,660
Rose.

1250
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,120
Rose.

1251
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:25,200
No, Rose.

1252
02:14:25,450 --> 02:14:26,540
No, Rose.

1253
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:27,950
No, Rose.

1254
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:40,790
Good God.

1255
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:42,540
Allah.

1256
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:44,330
Someone call an ambulance.

1257
02:14:44,410 --> 02:14:48,540
Ayush! Ayush! Ayush!

1258
02:14:48,910 --> 02:14:51,410
Doctor. Do you think he'll be okay?

1259
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:54,460
I really can't say anything.

1260
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:56,250
He's lost an awful lot of blood.

1261
02:14:57,330 --> 02:14:59,040
I don't think he's going to survive.

1262
02:15:29,620 --> 02:15:32,330
- Rose.
- Why, Ayush?

1263
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:36,080
Why do you try to kill yourself?

1264
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:42,120
Last time I saw you when I
was hanging between life and death.

1265
02:15:44,370 --> 02:15:47,250
I thought if I'm in
the same predicament again...

1266
02:15:47,410 --> 02:15:48,790
...then I'll see you.

1267
02:15:50,370 --> 02:15:51,950
And look Rose...

1268
02:15:53,290 --> 02:15:54,500
See...

1269
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:56,410
My belief was right.

1270
02:15:57,620 --> 02:16:00,580
This isn't right, Ayush. It's wrong.

1271
02:16:01,330 --> 02:16:04,080
It's not your time
to come over this side yet.

1272
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:07,160
You're needed back there.
In that world.

1273
02:16:07,250 --> 02:16:09,120
If there's one less
Ayush in that world...

1274
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:10,540
...it won't matter to anyone.

1275
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:12,250
Of course, it will.

1276
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:16,120
That Ayush saved me from dying once.

1277
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:21,450
And that Ayush can give hopes
to a lot more people with his music.

1278
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:23,370
I feel lonely without you.

1279
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:27,450
I don't want to live.

1280
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:30,450
Why do you think I am not with you?

1281
02:16:30,830 --> 02:16:32,660
I am always with you.

1282
02:16:32,910 --> 02:16:36,910
Then why can't I see you?
Why can't I touch you?

1283
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:39,540
Why can't I talk to you?

1284
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:44,370
Love isn't visible,
Ayush, you can't touch it either.

1285
02:16:44,950 --> 02:16:46,870
You can only feel love.

1286
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:50,450
I will always live in your heart.

1287
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:52,830
Just try calling out to me.

1288
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:59,540
Go back Ayush,
and try to find me through your heart.

1289
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:03,950
That's where you will find me,
like always.

1290
02:17:15,450 --> 02:17:20,540
"You're my slumber and my dreams."

1291
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:25,540
"Your image dwells in my eyes."

1292
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:34,870
"Your fire is still lit in my ashes."

1293
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:46,500
"I laugh at your happiness,
and cry in your sorrows."

1294
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:56,120
"I wake up with you,
and fall asleep when you do."

1295
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:06,830
"My life,
and my death, you're all I have."

1296
02:18:06,910 --> 02:18:12,410
"Without you I am nothing."

1297
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:17,870
"You're everything to me."

1298
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:23,660
"You exist in me like so, my love..."

1299
02:18:23,750 --> 02:18:29,040
"...there's no part of me left."

1300
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,870
"You've spread all
the way to my soul..."

1301
02:18:34,290 --> 02:18:38,700
"...that now I dwell in you."

1302
02:18:38,790 --> 02:18:43,870
"You're my reality... and my hope."

1303
02:18:43,950 --> 02:18:49,160
"You're all I see wherever I look...
and in my memories too..."

1304
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:54,370
"Whatever's left of me,
now belongs to you..."

1305
02:18:54,450 --> 02:19:00,080
"I am no longer myself anymore."

1306
02:19:00,370 --> 02:19:05,500
"You exist in me like so, my love..."

1307
02:19:05,580 --> 02:19:10,540
"...there's no part of me left."

1308
02:19:10,750 --> 02:19:15,830
"You've spread all
the way to my soul..."

1309
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,950
"...that now I dwell in you."

1310
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:12,750
"You dwell in my breath..."

1311
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:17,120
"...I am your journey."

1312
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:23,750
"Don't ever leave me..."

1313
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:27,950
"...I am your abode."

1314
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:38,620
"Promise me you'll
always stay with me.

1315
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:48,080
"Love me a little more than you do."

1316
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:54,160
"Without you...I've nothing."

1317
02:20:54,250 --> 02:20:59,080
"You are my world."

1318
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:04,540
"My hopes...my belief."

1319
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:10,580
"You are my sky."

1320
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:15,870
"You exist in me like so, my love..."

1321
02:21:15,950 --> 02:21:20,910
"...there's no part of me left."

1322
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:26,200
"You've spread all
the way to my soul..."

1323
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:31,370
"...that now I dwell in you."
