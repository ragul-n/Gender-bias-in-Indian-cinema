1
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:53,525
There are 10 '0s' in 5000 crores.

2
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:57,665
Your brother will need a lifetime
to return that kind of money.

3
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,665
Tell him to spend 5-years
behind bars instead.

4
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:04,336
It'll be over before he knows it.

5
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,038
Why return them when he didn't take it?

6
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,720
Where are these 5000 crores?

7
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:10,218
Did you find them?

8
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:14,576
Look, sir,
I think he shouldn't go to jail at all.

9
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:17,784
Your brother has changed
the entire scenario of the city.

10
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:19,838
But look...

11
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:22,753
It's all too clear.

12
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,441
We won't go to jail at any cost.

13
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,926
Whatever it takes.

14
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,297
We've more money than God.

15
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,761
Even you know
that it's no longer in our control.

16
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,242
- We've orders from the top.
- The top?

17
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:39,438
Where were you two a year ago?

18
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:45,115
Go tell your superiors
that Hemant is above all.

19
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:48,401
Viren... think about your family.

20
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:53,451
Your wife and kids...

21
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:05,939
He is speaking calculatively.

22
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,683
If you guys don't have decent offer

23
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,739
then at least give
a decent piece of advice.

24
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:24,962
'At the stroke of the midnight hour,
when the world sleeps'

25
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:28,210
'India will awake to light and freedom.'

26
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,670
'India woke up to a mixed economy.'

27
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:33,427
'The landlord system was abolished.'

28
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:39,541
'Then, to abolish poverty
private banks were nationalised.'

29
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,604
In fact, even the newspapers were saying

30
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:44,890
that India is on
the verge of bankruptcy.

31
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,473
And foreign reserves are depleting.

32
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:53,114
The government started
selling RBI's gold secretly.

33
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:55,838
And India
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

34
00:03:57,298 --> 00:03:58,917
The country was poor

35
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,482
maybe it had poorer ideologies.

36
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,712
But as soon as the economy opened up

37
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:08,362
a small tip gave a man
some pretty big ideas.

38
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:12,973
His ideas had flourished
even before him.

39
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,356
Greetings, Mr. Hemant.

40
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:16,578
Hi, Mr. Baldev! How are you?

41
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:18,974
Thank you very much.

42
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,313
What for?

43
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:23,768
Taking such good care of my child.

44
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:26,456
But today is his last day here.

45
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,520
I am moving him to Doon School.

46
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,654
- Doon School?
- Yes.

47
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,129
- Straight to Doon School.
- Yes.

48
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,910
That's quite a leap, Mr. Baldev.

49
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:41,109
Imagine, I won the jackpot.

50
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:44,941
- What jackpot?
- Stock market.

51
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:48,644
I've been investing
for the past 15-years now.

52
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,141
But never made any good profit.

53
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:56,662
But last week a broker
gave me a very nice tip.

54
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:05,551
Bombay Textile is going to give
strong financial results in two weeks.

55
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:09,848
And the Singhanias want the broker
to buy one million shares.

56
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:10,957
Starting now.

57
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:15,618
So that prices increase
when the results are declared.

58
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:19,420
It's pretty simple, Mr. Hemant.

59
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:23,860
I'll buy 20,000 shares
at the rate of 24 rupees.

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,784
And the broker's told me

61
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:28,293
that once the results are declared

62
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,959
the rate of my shares will
increase from 24 to 50 rupees.

63
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,358
Imagine...

64
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:37,407
520,000...

65
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:38,586
Yes. Profit!

66
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:42,084
Sir, don't take
Mr. Baldev's tip so seriously.

67
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:49,011
Never interrupt a man
when he's aiming for the top.

68
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:54,558
Do one thing...

69
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:58,725
Find me
the Bombay Textile's Annual report.

70
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:00,806
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:03,445
Let's go.

72
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:16,893
Priya.

73
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,163
- Priya. Hurry up, Priya.
- Yes, dad. I am coming.

74
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:22,274
Which beer did you get this time?

75
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:23,248
Thunderpunch.

76
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:24,547
Don't call it a beer.

77
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:27,277
- Let's put a quarter of whiskey in it.
- Yeah! How are you?

78
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,484
And next morning, full hangover.

79
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:31,765
Just add water.

80
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:34,007
- Don't speak nonsense.
- You are speaking nonsense.

81
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:37,444
In our budget,
whatever we buy will give us hangover.

82
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:50,896
Listen, I'll arrange
a meeting with her today.

83
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:53,504
You two have been watching each other
from a distance for a year now.

84
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,130
- This meeting will happen today.
- Hey...

85
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,512
I even said it's your birthday.

86
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:01,874
Don't be upset and spoil our mood
if she refused to come over.

87
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,118
There you go, Viren. Let's start.
It's too late now.

88
00:07:04,198 --> 00:07:06,155
He's going to sulk over Priya's denial.

89
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:07,679
Pour some more.

90
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,768
Hi...

91
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,143
Beer? Goldspot.

92
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:16,150
Out here?

93
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,294
Cheers.

94
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,803
You're not drinking.

95
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:23,322
You don't know about his tantrums.
He...

96
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,629
I will drink.
Only when the best quality is available.

97
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:34,750
"Happy birthday to you."

98
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:38,199
"Happy birthday to you."

99
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,655
You have
the world's best brother and friend.

100
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:49,086
I know, but how do you know this?

101
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:53,709
Who else would arrange for a fake
birthday party in such a short time?

102
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:58,187
And you can't have
two birthdays in 7 months.

103
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:01,674
Aunt had come over to give sweets.

104
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:11,039
Look Hemant, I don't want
to give you any wrong indication.

105
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:13,683
I like you.

106
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:17,881
But...

107
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:21,413
My mom and dad are looking
for a husband for me.

108
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,446
And they even have a checklist.

109
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:27,739
What?

110
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,182
Meaning they have some conditions.

111
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:36,437
Like the guy should own a car,
a proper job

112
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:39,060
and most importantly

113
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,880
he shouldn't be living in a rented home.

114
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,796
He should have a home of his own.

115
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,556
And I've none.

116
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,945
I don't believe in their conditions

117
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,687
but I can't go against them.

118
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,992
What are you looking at?

119
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,865
Hemant. Hemant.

120
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,164
- Those guys are beating up Viren again.
- What?

121
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,799
- Move. Move back. Come on.
- Get aside.

122
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,262
- Let me through. This is my home.
- Where are you going?

123
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:27,481
- What are you doing?
- One minute. One miinute.

124
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:30,409
- Let's just talk.
Why are you beating me? - Stop.

125
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,644
- Leave me.
- What are you doing?

126
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:33,987
- Let Viren go.
- Save me.

127
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:35,168
Who are you?

128
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:37,748
I... I am his older brother.

129
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,164
Better explain to your brother

130
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:42,735
when he borrows money from the market,
he should return it on time.

131
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:44,402
What did you think?

132
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:45,918
Hey...

133
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:47,242
Talk to me. Don't hit me.

134
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:48,262
I said talk to me.

135
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:50,171
He thinks if he doesn't answer my calls,
I'll lay off him.

136
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:52,963
What is he talking about? What money?

137
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:55,512
Brother, I got a tip...

138
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:56,457
150,000 rupees.

139
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:58,094
With interest, it amounts to 200,000!

140
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,733
I invested the money
in the stock market and lost everything.

141
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,686
- Hey...
- Let's talk.

142
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:05,063
Listen. Listen.

143
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:07,830
You'll get your money.

144
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:11,486
I assure you, just let him go.

145
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,557
2 weeks... 200,000...

146
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:16,291
Otherwise...

147
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:17,479
Otherwise...

148
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:20,608
You'll get it.

149
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:21,712
- The entire amount?
- Please leave.

150
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,086
- Let's go.
- Get lost.

151
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,674
Which company did
you invest your money in?

152
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:30,119
How do I say?

153
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:34,864
Two guys came to me with an
idea of setting up a beer factory.

154
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,143
Basically,
it turned out to be a bogus company.

155
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:41,957
Can I help?

156
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:44,888
No.

157
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:47,102
I'll handle it.

158
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:03,738
- It's not possible, Mr. Hemant.
- No, no Ashok, within a year.

159
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:07,487
Come on Hemant,
if it was just 5000 or 10000...

160
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:10,236
I can give you 60,000 for this.
And 6 months.

161
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:11,476
To get released.

162
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,805
One lakh. Time 10 months.

163
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,115
I can't win in negotiation.

164
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,115
80,000?

165
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,872
- Viren!
- Yes, brother.

166
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:22,966
Do one thing.

167
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:27,033
Buy 5000 shares of Bombay Textiles.

168
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:29,116
Immediately.

169
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:33,193
I visit Shirdi, stand in the queue
for 5-hours, pray for my children

170
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:34,594
and what do my children do?

171
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:36,105
Sell my jewellery.

172
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:38,163
No mom, we didn't sell.
It's an investment.

173
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:40,296
Shut up! You've always been greedy.

174
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:43,324
But you're the smarter one, Hemant.

175
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:46,405
That's why I planned
this investment, mom.

176
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:48,589
Nonsense...

177
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,751
Brother what was your plan
behind this investment.

178
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:52,849
I got a tip,
I took a gamble and got screwed.

179
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:54,718
You also did the same thing.

180
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,699
There's a big difference
between a fluke and placing a bet.

181
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:03,906
I planned this carefully, gathered
information, before making this bet.

182
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,426
What you did was a fluke.

183
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:10,587
Bombay Textile is an enormous company.

184
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,321
They are financially strong.

185
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,902
They're planning for an expansion.

186
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:16,014
Their share prices will rise for sure.
You just wait and watch.

187
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,259
But when?

188
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,626
It's been five days,
and there is no hike at all.

189
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,391
- It will.
- But when?

190
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:22,729
I said it will.

191
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,168
It will just watch.

192
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,734
- Did it rise?
- "This is a story I want everyone to see."

193
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:40,196
"Watch as I crank up the jealousy."

194
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:43,070
"This is a story
I want everyone to see."

195
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,377
"Because their mouths I've got to feed."

196
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:48,233
"They don't know how hard I strived."

197
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:50,820
"I was willing... to agree to it all."

198
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,429
"All my life, they made me shed tears."

199
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:55,850
"Everything I earned they took a share."

200
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,583
"Even with teary eyes,
I kept their business going."

201
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:00,949
"And yet they sidelined me."

202
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,267
"It's all their treachery."

203
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:03,568
"Their trickery."

204
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:06,328
"They hurt the entire country."

205
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:08,990
"They think I am a saint."

206
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,699
You're not from the stock market

207
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,604
and yet you took such a great leap.

208
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:16,584
"Watch me closely,
I am the shackle holding you down."

209
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:19,193
"Abusing in English sounds cool"

210
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:22,110
"and my abusing makes
me sound like a fool."

211
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,162
"These fools fill up the pool."

212
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:27,424
"You may be the principal,
but I am the whole school."

213
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:31,215
'As expected the price of
Bombay Textile's shares hiked.'

214
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:33,845
'300,000 in two weeks.'

215
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:36,879
'I hadn't made this huge amount
of money in three-years of my job.'

216
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:45,070
[chanting prayers]

217
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:51,265
Viren, wake up. Come on, wake up.

218
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,119
Viren. How does one
become a stockbroker?

219
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,352
- I want to be one.
- What are you saying?

220
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,030
Stockbroker. Wake up.

221
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:01,561
We made money from a tip that
comes once in a couple of years.

222
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:03,776
We were lucky.

223
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,498
It's a stressful job.
I am thinking of quitting.

224
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:12,344
Only those with a habit of
winning become winners, understand.

225
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:13,624
And you're talking about quitting.

226
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,562
Whose quitting what?

227
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:16,888
Shoes...

228
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:19,955
Nothing. Leave it.

229
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,892
Give it.

230
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:26,099
I want to be a stockbroker, and
he's talking about quitting the market.

231
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,988
This is our opportunity
to make a fortune

232
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,258
but he's being a wimp.

233
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:30,808
Wait a second.

234
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,532
You can't become a stockbroker easily.

235
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:34,156
You'll need a lot of money for that.

236
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,191
You'll need connections
with renowned businessmen.

237
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:40,162
And no one will let you
inside the ring like this.

238
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:43,977
I am done doing simple jobs.

239
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:48,688
Mom, please make him understand.
He's lost his mind.

240
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,440
Hemant. Hemant.

241
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,843
Hemant.

242
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:55,888
Move. Move. Let me do it.

243
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:02,520
Listen, son,
such miracles won't happen every day.

244
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:05,289
People call the stock market
a gamble ground.

245
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:07,534
Try to understand.

246
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:10,662
This family runs on your earnings.

247
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:13,923
Without that...

248
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,110
Mom, it wasn't a fluke, please.

249
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,747
I took advantage of the information.

250
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:22,320
Advantage...

251
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,051
And information can be obtained...

252
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:27,059
Last time I did it
because I was helpless.

253
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,157
This time I'll do it,
so we're never helpless again.

254
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:31,036
Try to understand.

255
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,619
But, listen...

256
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:37,242
I've done 6 jobs in 14-years.

257
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:38,656
And what do we have?

258
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,352
Priya is on the verge of getting married

259
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,469
and this is my opportunity
to make a fortune.

260
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,344
Don't worry. You won't regret it.

261
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:45,767
- Hemant.
- Yeah...

262
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:49,143
Let's go, we're getting late for office.

263
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:52,023
Mom, did you make him understand?

264
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:54,632
You won't quit the share market.

265
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,671
You will support Hemant. He needs you.

266
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,626
So, he made you understand.

267
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:05,374
If brother can perform
such a miracle again

268
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:08,058
then we will be sorted for life.

269
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,568
You think, he can't do it.

270
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:14,627
No.

271
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,789
I am scared that he'll do it again.

272
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,354
- Where to?
- Inside.

273
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,074
You can't go in. Come on.

274
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:23,832
And then he won't stop.

275
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,071
- Brother.
- "Rich are happy"

276
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,760
- "because poor are on sale."
- Get aside. Come on.

277
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,331
"Whose fault is it?
And who goes to jail."

278
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,133
"Do you wanna be a Cheetah?
Or just a Snail."

279
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:36,612
"I'm helpless
because my plates never full."

280
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:37,996
- "The society will think"
- 300 rupees...

281
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:39,240
"my deeds are shameful."

282
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,580
- "I'll alone pull the weights."
- I'll order the tea and come.

283
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:44,398
"Remember,
I am the one and only Big Bull."

284
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,089
"Let's go."

285
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:49,567
"This is a story
I want everyone to see."

286
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,169
"Watch as I crank up the jealousy."

287
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:54,651
Which treasure is he searching for,
in this scrap shop?

288
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:57,540
"I've to satiate their hunger too..."

289
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,103
"This is a story
I want everyone to see."

290
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:02,832
"Watch as I crank up the jealousy."

291
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:08,443
If fate had favoured me,
and I had more contacts

292
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,596
I could've taken this city to the sky.

293
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:18,321
A real man makes his own destiny.

294
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:23,836
I will.

295
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:26,788
And soon.

296
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,200
We'll have a grand wedding.

297
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,279
You've big dreams, Hemant.

298
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:36,917
I like it.

299
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:40,820
But I can't wait
for you to fulfill them.

300
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,747
Before taking this city to the sky

301
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:47,954
I want you to be
worthy enough to ask for me.

302
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:55,824
We do all the work,
and Kantilal takes half the share.

303
00:17:56,932 --> 00:18:01,081
We'll have to get out of this small
world of sub-broking and be bigger.

304
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,485
We'll have to take
the membership of BSE.

305
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,646
Are you joking?

306
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,247
Your idea is great.

307
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:14,241
But the fee for BSE's membership
is one million rupees.

308
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:16,667
We get only 500-1000 rupees.

309
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:18,980
We make 12,000 in a month.

310
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:20,587
Let's go.

311
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,036
The market is unpredictable. Got it?

312
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:25,453
Kanti bhai, here's your cheque for 50%

313
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,760
Okay.

314
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:32,828
Hemant, bring me a big tip.

315
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:39,530
Giving me 50% out of every deal
will get you nowhere.

316
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,590
Understood.

317
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,194
What to do?

318
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,602
My father didn't leave
behind a broker's card for me.

319
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,602
We've to settle the accounts
with Rajesh as well.

320
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:52,644
Kanti bhai...

321
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:56,627
Be careful.
You don't know what to say...

322
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,916
Rajesh, please settle our accounts.

323
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,035
Hey, what are you doing, sir?

324
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,712
- Viren. Let's go.
- Yes.

325
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,067
- Where?
- I said, let's go.

326
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,619
At least tell me

327
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,027
what you read in the newspaper

328
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,113
that we're going to visit
this big Union Leader.

329
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:24,856
Premier auto vehicles are in demand

330
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:26,828
there is 6 months
of waiting for a vehicle.

331
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,664
Will he get us
a dealership of the vehicles?

332
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:36,746
The company is increasing
production to meet the demand.

333
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:38,487
This means the share price
is going to rise.

334
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,172
But why are we in such a hurry?

335
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,322
Rana Sawant has instructed the company
to fulfill the demands of the workers

336
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:46,639
or else he will get down to strike.

337
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:48,686
What is it to us?

338
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:51,698
I want to know whether

339
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:55,418
he's actually going on a strike
or just a baseless threat?

340
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:59,534
We're average people.
How can we question him?

341
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:10,548
Raju, does Sawant carry a gun?

342
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:13,561
Not just him,
even his dozen bodyguards carry guns.

343
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:14,886
And that too imported ones.

344
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:20,191
Brother, I am not going. You go.

345
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:25,417
You want the nectar
but not willing to churn the ocean.

346
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,668
I don't want to die.

347
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:29,568
I am scared. You go alone.

348
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,115
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

349
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:34,112
Let's go. Let's go.

350
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:38,965
Hello, boss.

351
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,686
Wait.

352
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:43,497
Does this look like a carnival to you?

353
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,193
Who is the boss?

354
00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:47,094
He's the boss.

355
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,827
Only the boss can meet the boss, okay.

356
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,745
You sit here. Come on. Sit.

357
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:55,911
Let's go.

358
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,121
- Is everything safe inside?
- Yes.

359
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:09,883
You have five minutes.

360
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:14,617
I am a broker,
here to talk about your profit.

361
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:19,045
I don't treat people
who lie to us about our benefits.

362
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:25,321
I am not big enough yet to risk my life.

363
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,190
Look.

364
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:40,974
You fulfill the needs of workers

365
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:44,575
so is me for the middle class people.

366
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:46,362
What help do you want from us?

367
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,058
I am here to help you.

368
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:58,158
You have 2300 workers
at the Premier Auto Plant.

369
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:04,288
A week's strike means
350,000 in expense...

370
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,154
which I can give you.

371
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:11,314
You'll give me 350,000 rupees.

372
00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:16,585
Have you seen your condition?

373
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:25,678
Two things are considered
important in life.

374
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,699
Water and Gold.

375
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:32,953
A person cannot survive without water.

376
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,441
And Gold...

377
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,203
Gold can't be used
for man's daily needs.

378
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:48,900
Yet the rate of gold
is higher than water.

379
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,003
Come to the point.

380
00:22:57,134 --> 00:23:00,074
I'll build my value like gold.

381
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:17,059
10,000...

382
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,798
I can turn it into Ten lakh rupees
if you help me.

383
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:30,269
Why would I have any connection
with a man who talks about turning

384
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,460
10,000 rupees to Ten lakh rupees?

385
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:36,054
Why should I trust you?

386
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,253
Because the risk is on me. Not you.

387
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:47,779
This 10,000 is my life's earnings.

388
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:53,191
You just have to give me one
information, and you'll lose nothing.

389
00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:57,323
But if I can't take
advantage of that information

390
00:23:58,207 --> 00:23:59,499
then I am finished.

391
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:03,495
What information do you want?

392
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:11,676
When and which plant will you call
for a strike and when will you end it?

393
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:23,470
"Do you know where money belongs?"

394
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,057
"Consider it a sin
or consider it a blessing."

395
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,687
"Makes and breaks lives overnight."

396
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,233
"Fill your pockets or make wealth."

397
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:33,762
"Do you want to change
to system or blame it?"

398
00:24:33,842 --> 00:24:36,422
"Do you want to catch me or my game?"

399
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:39,033
"I am the bull you can never tame."

400
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:41,634
"Their hands move
when at me they take aim."

401
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,181
"The poor are silent
because the rich get's easy bail."

402
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,832
"Rich are happy
because poor are on sale."

403
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:49,399
"Whose fault is it?
And who goes to jail."

404
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:52,177
"Do you wanna be a Cheetah?
Or just a Snail."

405
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,675
"I'm helpless
because my plates never full."

406
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:57,304
"The society will think
my deeds are shameful."

407
00:24:57,384 --> 00:25:00,083
"I'll alone pull the weights."

408
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:02,608
"Remember,
I am the one and only Big Bull."

409
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:07,485
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,958
So you want to be a broker.

411
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:26,065
You do know
what it takes to get this card.

412
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,511
Yes.

413
00:25:28,782 --> 00:25:30,609
It comes with great responsibility.

414
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:33,899
Yes, I know.

415
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:38,709
We know too.

416
00:25:42,227 --> 00:25:46,498
I know what you're doing
with Premier Auto.

417
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:56,286
What are we doing, sir?
Just making some money, that's it.

418
00:25:56,622 --> 00:26:00,573
Making money, huh.

419
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:04,793
Shall I let you in on a secret?

420
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:11,426
You're investing in the market
by gathering secret information

421
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:14,092
it's called Insider Trading.

422
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:18,705
You're lucky this law
doesn't exist in India yet.

423
00:26:20,153 --> 00:26:24,056
If this was America,
you would be behind bars.

424
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:30,499
There's still time.
Mend your ways. Got it?

425
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,336
You bring the law

426
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:43,125
we'll stop doing it.

427
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:50,448
What a stare you gave that Mannu.

428
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:51,744
He was scared.

429
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:53,662
Give him the stare is not my motive.

430
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,191
Watch what I do next.

431
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:57,354
Listen, our new office...

432
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:06,133
- What happened, man?
- Rana Sawant got murdered.

433
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:08,257
Run for your lives.
The riot is going on.

434
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,894
'Rana Sawant's murder wasn't
the first shock for Hemant.'

435
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:40,982
'But it prepared Hemant for the ups and
downs of the market, as well as life.'

436
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:48,310
'Today, in Hemant Shah's
case a big news will be disclosed.'

437
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,140
Sir...

438
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,667
- Sir...
- One question, sir. Please.

439
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:54,365
One at a time.
Ask your questions one by one, please.

440
00:27:54,445 --> 00:27:55,495
One at a time.

441
00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:58,470
Mr. Ashok,
why do you think you're here?

442
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:01,633
I came to have a drink at the bar.
Will you join me?

443
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,317
Such stupid questions
deserve stupid answers. Next.

444
00:28:04,397 --> 00:28:05,224
- Sir!
- Yes.

445
00:28:05,304 --> 00:28:08,154
As Hemant's lawyer,
what is your opinion on everything

446
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:09,364
that transpired in the last six months?

447
00:28:09,444 --> 00:28:11,963
It's very unfair to him. That's it.

448
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:12,914
- Sir.
- Yes.

449
00:28:12,994 --> 00:28:14,963
What big expose will happen
at the press conference today?

450
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:16,543
Please give us a hint.

451
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:20,479
Look, when Hemant is
involved expect something big.

452
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,391
But let me tell you, this time
there's going to be an explosion.

453
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:24,629
- Explosion?
- Yes.

454
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:25,484
Be prepared for it.

455
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:26,814
- That's all for now. Thank you.
- Sir...

456
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:35,904
Have you thought this through?

457
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:47,556
We should've got married
instead of getting the membership.

458
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,010
We've only 17,000 rupees in the bank.

459
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,344
Do I pay the office rent or salaries?

460
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:55,909
Will you ever say anything positive?

461
00:28:55,989 --> 00:28:57,592
We've a BR worth 40 lakh Rupees.

462
00:28:57,672 --> 00:29:00,746
Venkateshwar is the head
of securities and trading.

463
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,293
I am sure it's going
to be something big.

464
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,598
I was supposed to go
watch a film with Tara.

465
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:06,310
Come with me quietly.

466
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:09,289
And you can watch movies on the
VCR with Tara for the rest of your life.

467
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:12,520
- Does Venkateshwar sell VCRs too?
- Keep quiet.

468
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,899
Why did you stop here?
The bank is much further ahead.

469
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,182
We'll take a cab from here.

470
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:22,722
What for?

471
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:25,188
We're brokers.

472
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,666
We've a membership worth Ten lakh rupees

473
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:28,993
but they don't know that we're broke.

474
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:30,848
Fix your shirt.

475
00:29:32,642 --> 00:29:33,519
Taxi!

476
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:48,452
Hari... sent this.

477
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,200
Look Hemant and Viren.

478
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,690
The banking system has formed a new law.

479
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,783
We're investing
our surplus funds with other banks

480
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:05,281
but now those transactions
can only be done through a broker.

481
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,545
So every bank
has to invest its surplus fund

482
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,233
and through a broker.

483
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:17,715
Yes. It's an investment between banks.

484
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:22,672
So the government wants brokers
to make a small fortune too.

485
00:30:25,175 --> 00:30:26,317
Why not?

486
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:30,074
Look... if a bank needs money

487
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:33,156
those banks with surplus funds
will lend it to them.

488
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:36,370
For a short term,
and charge interest of course.

489
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,631
Now they can't give security every day.

490
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:41,800
Right.

491
00:30:42,226 --> 00:30:43,851
That's why the borrower bank...

492
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,764
The bank that's borrowing the money

493
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,782
will issue a BR like this.

494
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:51,187
We call it a Bank Receipt.

495
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:57,741
I am issuing you
a pay order today of four million.

496
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:12,136
In your name, against this BR.

497
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:19,070
Two weeks later Bank of Satara will
return this four million with interest

498
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,942
and you'll transfer that money
to our bank from your account.

499
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:27,405
Then we'll return
this Bank Receipt to you.

500
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:35,059
For the settlement
and reconciliation of the Bank of Satara.

501
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:37,636
Understood.

502
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:43,937
For this,
we'll pay you a commission of 0.01%

503
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:46,951
- 0.01%
- Yes.

504
00:31:48,248 --> 00:31:49,421
Something big, as you said.

505
00:31:50,646 --> 00:31:52,371
We'll get 400 rupees as commission.

506
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,893
Our lives are changed.

507
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:02,664
Look, we're giving you
a cheque of 40 lakh rupees today.

508
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:05,188
Tomorrow it could be 40 crores also.

509
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,700
The transaction between
the banks will increase every day.

510
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:13,894
And our banks always have surplus funds.

511
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:17,184
You can get a cheque daily

512
00:32:18,132 --> 00:32:20,907
from our bank or maybe another.

513
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:23,713
Good luck.

514
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:31,159
0.01%

515
00:32:31,622 --> 00:32:32,786
Something big, you said.

516
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,622
I've a cheque for forty lakh rupees.

517
00:32:36,244 --> 00:32:37,503
It's any day more than one million.

518
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,797
Look, one needs money
to start any business.

519
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:43,878
This is that money.

520
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:47,493
I don't have time to
arrange for working capital.

521
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:50,132
You know,
I don't know how to tread slow.

522
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:53,288
Stop trying to be funny.
This money belongs to the bank, not you.

523
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,166
It's mine for two weeks.

524
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,094
Using someone else's
money as our working capital.

525
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:00,913
It's risky.

526
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,745
Show me any business
that doesn't involve risk.

527
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:06,858
If there is one,
let's quit all this and take that up.

528
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:08,099
Okay?

529
00:33:09,617 --> 00:33:13,601
- Look, the bank's not going
to give us a loan. - Yes.

530
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:16,607
But we can keep this money as a loan.

531
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:29,135
Wow... it's awesome.

532
00:33:30,438 --> 00:33:31,514
It's my first gift to you.

533
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:35,495
Don't make it the last
by saying it as the best.

534
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:42,209
Hemant, I cannot accept this.

535
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:44,318
Priya.

536
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,438
Go downstairs.

537
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:53,357
What's in it? Open it?

538
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:00,458
How much is it worth?

539
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:03,621
10,000.

540
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:05,678
Why are you wasting money?

541
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,928
Look Hemant,
I don't want to see my daughter

542
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,854
living in these quarters
for the rest of her life.

543
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,845
Priya knows only one Hemant,
I've seen a dozen.

544
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:22,585
If you were in any other business,
then maybe I would've thought about

545
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:24,563
when you'll buy home and a car.

546
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,083
But a broker...

547
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:30,730
Is a broker only, right?

548
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:43,568
And don't make a scene
at Priya's wedding.

549
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,315
Take it back.

550
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,667
That forty lakhs belong to the bank.

551
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,239
We can't do what you're thinking.

552
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,500
Listen!

553
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,959
Even that amount is too less now.

554
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,369
I want 2 crore rupees.

555
00:35:10,926 --> 00:35:11,925
2 crores?

556
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:17,633
Priya only got engaged.
The wedding is six months away.

557
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,971
[indistinct chatter]

558
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:35,861
What happened?

559
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:44,015
Speak up. Stop seeking attention.

560
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,033
I am going to lose my job.

561
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:50,165
And might even go to jail.

562
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:52,366
Why?

563
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:58,331
I sanctioned a loan for 30 lakh rupees
to a guy against a property.

564
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:00,909
Now he's disappeared.

565
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:02,639
I don't know what to do.

566
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:06,476
Do something, Hemant.
I can't think of anything.

567
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:10,072
I want 30 lakhs at any cost.

568
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,139
What's going on here?

569
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:16,643
He wants 2 crores, you want 30 lakhs.

570
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,856
We don't have enough money
to pay the staff's salary.

571
00:36:18,936 --> 00:36:21,467
We've turned off the AC
to save on electricity bill.

572
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:23,844
What do I do?

573
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:25,869
You tell me what to do? Go to jail?

574
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,464
Talk to your seniors.

575
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:32,770
No one's going to understand,
Viren, just like you.

576
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,165
Listen... Hey!

577
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,392
I said listen...

578
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:41,856
You know about our condition as well.

579
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:44,567
Have faith.

580
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:47,574
We'll think of something.
We'll come up with something.

581
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:48,612
Forget it, Viren.

582
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:52,335
Viren sir.
Hemant sir's calling him back.

583
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:59,681
Hari, issue me a BR tomorrow
for 2 crore rupees in the name of NBI.

584
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:03,656
Leave it me to me on how
to get it approved by Venkateshwar.

585
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:07,501
When I turn that 2 crores into 3 crores
you will get 30 lakh rupees.

586
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,201
What?

587
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,730
Wait a second. Wait a second.

588
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,467
Fake BR worth 2 crores?

589
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:28,225
Look... remember Premier Auto.

590
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:29,510
Yes.

591
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:33,765
Imagine if we had
2 crore rupees back then

592
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,655
where could that have taken us?

593
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,806
Hemant,
what you're asking for is too big.

594
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:44,431
Bigger than going to jail?

595
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:53,118
Listen, you'll be going to jail
for two-years for this loan case.

596
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:56,726
If you get caught for issuing fake BR,
you'll be jailed for 5-years.

597
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,513
In any case, you're going to jail.

598
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:01,439
I am taking all the risk.

599
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:07,090
Imagine what if you don't get caught?

600
00:38:09,515 --> 00:38:10,702
Then you're free.

601
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,678
And I'll be a millionaire.

602
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,281
Think about it.

603
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:20,303
I'll give you until tomorrow morning.

604
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,027
- Sir, Mr. Jayesh...
- Call him.

605
00:38:28,107 --> 00:38:29,033
Okay.

606
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:31,775
- Give the keys.
- Jayesh bhai, we have to buy 5000.

607
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:33,558
Go to your cabin. I am coming.

608
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:37,071
- Tell me, everthing after coming.
- Okay.

609
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:41,288
You were supposed to go to Rawat
Consultant's office. What happened?

610
00:38:43,314 --> 00:38:44,920
Will 2 crores turn into 3 crore rupees?

611
00:38:48,234 --> 00:38:49,802
We don't even have 2 crore yet.

612
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:51,746
I'll make it 3 crore...

613
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:56,581
- Yes?
- Sir, can't get through.

614
00:38:57,156 --> 00:39:00,575
I called at their office, but the
NCC guy says we can't talk to the MD.

615
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:03,249
He's very busy.
You can meet him only next month.

616
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,014
- Can I go, sir?
- Okay.

617
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:11,263
Why do you want to meet NCC's MD?

618
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:19,054
Look, our country is going
through a sensitive phase.

619
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:23,573
The new government is opening up
its market for new business.

620
00:39:24,186 --> 00:39:26,651
Now foreign countries will invest here.

621
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,285
The law of business is
the same as that of the sea.

622
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:34,842
The big fish will swallow
small fishes like NCC.

623
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:39,071
If I can explain this to the NCC's MD

624
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:43,864
then I will turn this
2 crores into 5 crores.

625
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:50,956
Hello.

626
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:54,418
Yeah, just a minute. Hari.

627
00:39:57,957 --> 00:39:58,928
Yeah, Hari.

628
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:05,684
Okay.

629
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:29,766
- Venkateshwar sir, greetings.
- Hemant, how are you?

630
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:30,921
Please, take a seat.

631
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:34,706
- So, you'll have tea?
- Yeah.

632
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,183
So how does the market...

633
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:43,243
Please.

634
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:48,463
Please... tell me.

635
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:54,307
Yeah.

636
00:40:56,759 --> 00:41:00,131
20 lakhs, 30 lakhs...

637
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:04,112
35 lakhs!

638
00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:10,459
2 crores.

639
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,455
2 crores...

640
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,093
What is this?

641
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:34,601
I don't think you remember.

642
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:39,224
To save you from your wife's temper.

643
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:41,824
Happy Wedding Anniversary.

644
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:47,250
Oh my...

645
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:50,757
All this. Please...

646
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:55,490
Well, thank you so much.

647
00:41:56,195 --> 00:41:58,593
You remembered my anniversary.

648
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:03,603
Well, I'll make pay orders
against all these BRs.

649
00:42:04,308 --> 00:42:05,972
Please. Have tea. Okay?

650
00:42:16,389 --> 00:42:18,540
Hello. The job's done.

651
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:20,245
Half!

652
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:22,934
The rest lies in your hands, Hemant.

653
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:25,402
Your job isn't done yet.

654
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:29,698
You'll have to give me
BR's worth 20 and 50 million now.

655
00:42:30,058 --> 00:42:31,602
There's no stopping now, Hari.

656
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:43,965
Hello. You asked me to call back at 3.

657
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:49,342
Sir, I told you to call back
on the 3rd... of next month.

658
00:42:49,422 --> 00:42:52,747
Is he so busy that he can't spare
five minutes to make 5 crore rupees?

659
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:03,654
- Hello!
- Buy 5000 shares of NCC.

660
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:05,346
The rate's 300, buy it at 320.

661
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:07,839
Yes, Viren. Okay.

662
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,550
NCC. NCC... buy 20.

663
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,949
74...

664
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:11,895
Buy 40.

665
00:43:11,975 --> 00:43:13,649
NCC. NCC... buy 30.

666
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:16,829
- Buy 50...
- Buy 60.

667
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:19,329
Buy NCC shares at a rate of 340.

668
00:43:19,688 --> 00:43:22,592
500...

669
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:26,279
Did see the rate of NCC's
shares is at an all-time high.

670
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:28,188
'Huge spike in the stock market.'

671
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:31,692
'Price of NCC's shares
jumped from 300 to 500.'

672
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:37,653
Sir. We just a call from NCC.

673
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:39,795
Their MD wants to meet you immediately.

674
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:50,293
- I'm here to meet, Mr. Singh.
- Yes.

675
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,539
This way, please.

676
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,007
What do you see in this painting?

677
00:44:00,168 --> 00:44:02,570
They look expensive to me. All of them.

678
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:04,256
They look expensive to me.

679
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,173
You didn't see the texture

680
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,005
or the light-shadow play,
or the colour choice.

681
00:44:14,607 --> 00:44:15,726
Just the price tag.

682
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,063
My guess about you was right.

683
00:44:22,345 --> 00:44:25,268
You're just a broker
who wants to meet me.

684
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:29,108
We can never be equal

685
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,860
then why are you trying to equal me?

686
00:44:33,068 --> 00:44:34,832
Why are you after my shares?

687
00:44:36,928 --> 00:44:38,104
Because...

688
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:41,618
Even though your company

689
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,343
is the market leader in cement
it's far too undervalued.

690
00:44:45,814 --> 00:44:46,852
Meaning?

691
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:51,140
Something wrong with my
financials or something else...

692
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:53,070
None of that.

693
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:57,022
Your company's value is 100 crores.

694
00:44:57,386 --> 00:45:00,231
But according to me,
it's worth 900 crores.

695
00:45:00,837 --> 00:45:06,370
Because if someone wants
to set up a company like NCC today

696
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,591
then he'll need an
investment of 300 crores.

697
00:45:10,392 --> 00:45:11,601
Three times more.

698
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,985
That's my replacement cost theory.

699
00:45:16,357 --> 00:45:20,743
Right now you're holding
90% of your company's shares.

700
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,241
90...

701
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:26,683
If you put only 10% in the market

702
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:29,871
then I can take this
100 crores to 900 crores.

703
00:45:30,491 --> 00:45:32,491
You'll lose some of your shares.

704
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:34,097
From 90 to only 80%

705
00:45:34,653 --> 00:45:37,859
But their value will be 10 times more.

706
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:43,784
- Sir...
- We'll talk later, Behrouz.

707
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:49,577
900 crores?

708
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:52,911
Have you seen 9 crores?

709
00:45:54,881 --> 00:45:57,614
Do you have any idea how
much money you're talking about?

710
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:01,228
You've seen it, haven't you?

711
00:46:02,123 --> 00:46:03,426
You've an idea about it.

712
00:46:04,484 --> 00:46:07,139
So, am I saying anything wrong?

713
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,292
How high can you take
the value of my shares?

714
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:20,030
Your shares will make history.

715
00:46:21,096 --> 00:46:22,488
I can guarantee you that.

716
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:24,354
Just say yes.

717
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,741
Such confidence.

718
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:31,606
If the value goes up to 1000...

719
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,257
I'll believe you.

720
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:36,789
Can you do it in 6-months?

721
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:40,930
I don't have that much time.

722
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,360
And yes...

723
00:46:52,566 --> 00:46:53,844
I can see another thing.

724
00:46:54,935 --> 00:46:56,040
The painter's name.

725
00:46:57,978 --> 00:46:59,317
Khalid Dorabji.

726
00:47:00,156 --> 00:47:03,923
He's ill. Lying in a hospital in Paris.

727
00:47:04,402 --> 00:47:05,766
Less chances of his survival.

728
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:10,070
So you buy the painting before I do.

729
00:47:10,992 --> 00:47:13,154
Because soon they
will become invaluable.

730
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:22,513
'NCC's shares which were seeing
a daily jump in price of 50-80 rupees.'

731
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:25,254
'It been said that NCC's shares...'

732
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:28,717
'In few months,
Hemant Shah with his new and...'

733
00:47:28,797 --> 00:47:33,734
Hemant took the price
of NCC's shares to 5000 rupees.

734
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:36,837
Many industrialist and businessmen

735
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:39,446
started seeing Hemant
expecting the same miracle.

736
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:41,363
What is the stock market?

737
00:47:41,774 --> 00:47:44,541
You've to go see an agent for that.
You know, brokers.

738
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:46,009
Should I invest some money too?

739
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:49,360
You should.
Investing in little money is good.

740
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,126
You'll get results in six-months.

741
00:47:52,177 --> 00:47:54,621
Unbelievable Sudeep,
at least check the spellings.

742
00:47:54,904 --> 00:47:57,732
Some retired uncle will write a letter
to the editor and bother him again.

743
00:47:57,812 --> 00:47:58,932
Do you want that?

744
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:00,318
Meera.

745
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,276
Think of the devil... Sir.

746
00:48:02,847 --> 00:48:06,003
Why are we ignoring the Hemant Shah
and Stock Exchange story?

747
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,454
- Really?
- Really!

748
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,292
I need an answer.
Will you please answer me?

749
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:11,492
I am the chief editor,
I hope you know that.

750
00:48:12,569 --> 00:48:13,737
- I know that.
- Yeah!

751
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:17,294
We're not ignoring it. We're infact
celebrating the stock market rally.

752
00:48:17,684 --> 00:48:20,868
Come on, Meera,
I am sure something is happening there.

753
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,845
Wake up and smell the coffee.

754
00:48:23,472 --> 00:48:26,954
Being a communist if you edit a financial
paper, you're bound to draw attention.

755
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,110
Something's cooking there, Meera.
Come on.

756
00:48:30,571 --> 00:48:32,864
The middle-class is pocketing
some of the rich's money.

757
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:35,225
That's all that's happening.
You should be happy.

758
00:48:35,733 --> 00:48:37,907
Oh! Really?

759
00:48:40,568 --> 00:48:42,567
'History was created
at the Stock market today.'

760
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:46,136
'The ever increasing price of
NCC's share has reached 5000 rupees.'

761
00:48:46,454 --> 00:48:49,127
'It's being said that every share
that Hemant Shah's bought'

762
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:51,025
'is seeing a steep incline.'

763
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:57,003
MD sir, your shares
have reached record price.

764
00:48:57,853 --> 00:49:01,392
Now do as I say, dilute your stake.

765
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:03,367
From 55% to 30%

766
00:49:03,447 --> 00:49:06,175
and earn the biggest
profit of your life.

767
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:09,687
But Hemant, the share price is going up.

768
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,480
Shouldn't we wait?

769
00:49:14,238 --> 00:49:16,777
MD sir, I alone am
controlling this price.

770
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,139
Sell them now.

771
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,032
Yes, Hemant sir.

772
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,427
Shekhar,
buy all the NCC shares you can get.

773
00:49:36,162 --> 00:49:37,561
Called me a broker.

774
00:49:38,522 --> 00:49:40,453
How far are you planning
to take the share's price?

775
00:49:41,183 --> 00:49:42,016
9000.

776
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,340
9000?

777
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:48,205
What happened?

778
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,831
The '0's don't fit
on the calculator anymore.

779
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,845
What the...

780
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,025
Do you want to marry a girl
who doesn't love you?

781
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,547
You don't.

782
00:50:30,896 --> 00:50:34,605
Priya and I love each other.
We want to get married.

783
00:50:35,463 --> 00:50:39,277
I know I took too long to tell you,
but... as the saying goes...

784
00:50:39,742 --> 00:50:41,104
Better late than never.

785
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:46,462
You'll get to keep only one car key.

786
00:50:46,908 --> 00:50:49,236
The other one is for
my greedy father-in-law.

787
00:50:50,236 --> 00:50:53,780
'With the price of NCC
shares touching 11,000 rupees'

788
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,561
'Hemant Shah has started
share market's biggest... Bull run!'

789
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,641
Finally, after so long,
it feels like a Sunday today.

790
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:16,491
That's true.
Both of them love 'theplas' (pancakes).

791
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:18,051
You know what...

792
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:20,954
Serve these theplas
before Mahabharat starts.

793
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:24,976
Tara. Hurry up,
Mahabharat's about to begin.

794
00:51:25,056 --> 00:51:25,964
Hello.

795
00:51:27,465 --> 00:51:28,265
Who is this?

796
00:51:28,345 --> 00:51:32,029
Hemant sir. Pandey from Delhi
from the Minister's Residence.

797
00:51:32,624 --> 00:51:34,316
I apologise for disturbing
you on a Sunday.

798
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:36,651
Not at all, Mr. Pandey.

799
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:39,913
Sundays are usual for people like us.

800
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:41,619
How can I help you?

801
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,537
Well, our sir needs
your blessings in the market

802
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:48,110
and in-exchange I'll
give you political haven.

803
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:49,651
And what is this haven called?

804
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,751
Sanjeev Kohli.

805
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,158
Member of Parliament SP. Kohli's son.

806
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:56,138
He wants to release
IPOs of his company TelAir.

807
00:51:56,218 --> 00:51:58,708
So he wants to enter
the world of Telecomm.

808
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,320
Hemant sir, you alone are not responsible
for the progress of this country.

809
00:52:05,357 --> 00:52:07,389
Okay then,
I'll arrange for your tickets.

810
00:52:08,775 --> 00:52:10,127
See you in Delhi.

811
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:12,607
Viren.

812
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:14,160
- Yes, mom.
- Is everything alright?

813
00:52:15,236 --> 00:52:16,378
All good.

814
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:20,658
What happened?

815
00:52:23,071 --> 00:52:25,321
What can be better than this, mom?

816
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,257
Exactly.

817
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:30,688
The new house. The cars parked below.

818
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:33,133
Isn't this all happening too soon?

819
00:52:33,912 --> 00:52:37,096
Mom, you know brother can't tread slow.

820
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:38,875
I know.

821
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:40,766
Since he was in school.

822
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,594
Even in school, he...

823
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,896
Don't worry, mom.

824
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:46,918
It won't happen again.

825
00:52:47,892 --> 00:52:48,816
I am there.

826
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:51,915
Don't worry. Just watch.

827
00:52:56,329 --> 00:52:57,559
So when are you going to Delhi?

828
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,414
So you heard.

829
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,404
What happened?

830
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:13,897
We've been married for two months.

831
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:15,731
What about our honeymoon?

832
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:18,849
We're going to America next month.

833
00:53:19,424 --> 00:53:21,918
Forget America,
I haven't seen Delhi yet.

834
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:24,318
You're going to Delhi
the day after tomorrow.

835
00:53:25,487 --> 00:53:26,645
Take me along too.

836
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:28,349
At least show me Delhi.

837
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:44,571
Welcome, welcome, Hemant sir.
Welcome. Welcome, madam.

838
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:48,843
These guys will help you check-in.

839
00:53:49,074 --> 00:53:51,072
There's a car parked
outside for your sight-seeing.

840
00:53:51,152 --> 00:53:52,492
I've also assigned two bodyguards.

841
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:56,161
- Bodyguard?
- Yes, you need bodyguards.

842
00:53:56,643 --> 00:53:59,065
This is Delhi,
Hemant sir, you got to flaunt it.

843
00:53:59,751 --> 00:54:01,868
See you in the evening
at Sanjeev sir's party.

844
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:03,049
Be comfortable.

845
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:09,384
'There is a lot of anger
among the people of the Indian economy'

846
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:13,238
'on the new guidelines
of the parliamentary affairs committee.'

847
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:17,280
'Due to which, there has been a sharp
reaction by various economists'

848
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,042
'and also from the
Bombay Stock Exchange.'

849
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:25,930
'Parliamentary Affairs Committee...'

850
00:54:29,777 --> 00:54:37,280
"Why ask for my heart,
take my life instead."

851
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:45,966
"Just give flight to my dreams."

852
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:55,157
"Why ask for my heart,
take my life instead."

853
00:54:56,152 --> 00:55:03,182
"Just give flight to my dreams."

854
00:55:03,752 --> 00:55:12,424
"Even sweet nectar doesn't taste as good
as sweet as your memories."

855
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:21,167
"Our love has scaled new heights."

856
00:55:21,247 --> 00:55:25,552
"I prayed for love..."

857
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:29,392
"Prayed for your love."

858
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:34,273
"I prayed for love..."

859
00:55:34,353 --> 00:55:38,651
"Prayed for your love."

860
00:55:39,731 --> 00:55:44,249
"You're no longer you,
I am no longer me."

861
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:47,441
"Listen to each other's heart."

862
00:55:47,521 --> 00:55:51,738
"I prayed for love..."

863
00:55:51,818 --> 00:55:56,200
"Prayed for your love."

864
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,506
"I prayed for love..."

865
00:56:00,586 --> 00:56:06,176
"Prayed for your love."

866
00:56:24,015 --> 00:56:31,854
"Since the day I saw...
I feel lost myself."

867
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:36,780
"Night and day you're in my thoughts."

868
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,326
"But where am I?"

869
00:56:48,892 --> 00:56:57,766
"Yes. Since the day I saw...
I feel lost myself."

870
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:02,974
"Night and day you're in my thoughts."

871
00:57:03,054 --> 00:57:05,960
"But where am I?"

872
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:14,995
"Even sweet nectar doesn't taste as good
as sweet as your memories."

873
00:57:15,075 --> 00:57:23,083
"Our love has scaled new heights."

874
00:57:23,428 --> 00:57:27,749
"I prayed for love..."

875
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:31,586
"Prayed for your love."

876
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:36,470
"I prayed for love..."

877
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:41,044
"Prayed for your love."

878
00:57:41,746 --> 00:57:46,352
"You're no longer you,
I am no longer me."

879
00:57:46,432 --> 00:57:49,633
"Listen to each other's heart."

880
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:53,903
"I prayed for love..."

881
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:57,727
"Prayed for your love."

882
00:57:58,444 --> 00:58:02,680
"I prayed for love..."

883
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,723
"Prayed for your love."

884
00:58:11,486 --> 00:58:19,329
"I prayed for love..."

885
00:58:22,385 --> 00:58:27,625
"I prayed for love..."

886
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,113
Others are just alive
it's these guys who are living it up.

887
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:36,504
These Delhi people...
they live life like the kings

888
00:58:37,008 --> 00:58:40,876
Even if they do,
do they have to dress like one?

889
00:58:41,814 --> 00:58:44,416
What you see is what sells.

890
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:46,787
And if you have it, then flaunt it.

891
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:49,471
You're equal to each one here.

892
00:58:50,144 --> 00:58:52,163
And you've as much as anyone here.

893
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:58,074
Wear your jewellery to the next party.

894
00:58:58,154 --> 00:58:59,154
And then watch...

895
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:01,643
We're not one of them, Hemant.

896
00:59:02,228 --> 00:59:03,205
Hi, Hemant.

897
00:59:03,285 --> 00:59:05,650
- I am Pranay Oberoi. Classic Motors.
- Yes.

898
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:06,972
- Big fan.
- Thank you.

899
00:59:07,052 --> 00:59:08,683
- Come, join us.
- We will.

900
00:59:08,763 --> 00:59:09,963
- You will. Come.
- Yeah!

901
00:59:12,562 --> 00:59:13,636
Pranay Oberoi.

902
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,289
We may not be one of them,
but they want us to be.

903
00:59:20,887 --> 00:59:23,582
Do you know why? Because they all know

904
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:30,027
I can make much more
then what their entire ancestors made.

905
00:59:31,289 --> 00:59:32,365
Hemant sir...

906
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,694
Hemant sir, Sanjeev sir is calling you.

907
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:36,772
Yes... Come...

908
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:40,160
Just you, please.

909
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:44,871
Come...

910
00:59:45,268 --> 00:59:46,139
Come...

911
00:59:53,025 --> 00:59:55,072
Sanjeev sir... Mr. Hemant.

912
00:59:57,436 --> 01:00:00,329
Welcome, Mr. Hemant, welcome.

913
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:02,666
Welcome to Delhi.

914
01:00:04,907 --> 01:00:08,748
Firstly Mr. Hemant, congratulations.

915
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:13,501
Your working style is
as unique as it is aggressive.

916
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:15,786
Right foot first.

917
01:00:20,879 --> 01:00:26,506
You've helped so many companies manage
their operations in the stock market

918
01:00:26,586 --> 01:00:29,412
I would like you
to help us in a similar way.

919
01:00:31,248 --> 01:00:32,164
Go ahead.

920
01:00:32,524 --> 01:00:36,511
Mr. Hemant, what do you
think is the future of India?

921
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:41,206
It's the telecom industry.

922
01:00:41,896 --> 01:00:46,914
If you join us and I promise
you the sky will be the limit.

923
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:51,359
You can't even begin
to imagine the growth potential.

924
01:00:51,954 --> 01:00:56,375
India's top 10 industrialists...
whenever you want.

925
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:03,380
Mr. Sanjeev, even I want to
build a financially strong economy.

926
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:10,416
But for my ideas, I don't need
industrialists, but political support.

927
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,874
Mr. Hemant,
you just made my job a lot easier.

928
01:01:19,573 --> 01:01:20,501
Dad's there.

929
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:25,036
Anyone... anytime... your call.

930
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:26,198
What do you say?

931
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:27,943
Let's cheer for that.

932
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,488
Scotch?

933
01:01:56,783 --> 01:01:58,272
'Aren't you drinking?'

934
01:01:58,352 --> 01:01:59,309
'I will'

935
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,313
'only when I've the best quality.'

936
01:02:07,938 --> 01:02:09,376
TelAir's magic worked.

937
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:11,166
Hemant's magic worked.

938
01:02:11,868 --> 01:02:16,044
Those who were in the stock market,
their pockets got a little heavier.

939
01:02:18,746 --> 01:02:21,721
This month I made 300,000 rupees.

940
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:34,764
People would buy shares
when Hemant would raise his hands.

941
01:02:35,058 --> 01:02:37,237
Viren, Kantilal speaking.

942
01:02:38,151 --> 01:02:39,601
"The one and only Big Bull."

943
01:02:39,681 --> 01:02:41,208
I've called so many times.

944
01:02:41,288 --> 01:02:43,477
Let me speak with Hemant just once.

945
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:57,003
The world began to change
on Hemant's bidding.

946
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,784
"The one and only Big Bull."

947
01:03:01,117 --> 01:03:06,475
He had started manipulating share
prices, and I started writing about him.

948
01:03:10,397 --> 01:03:11,308
This man.

949
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,689
Do you know who he is?

950
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:14,916
He's the Amitabh Bachchan
(superstar) of the share market.

951
01:03:14,996 --> 01:03:16,529
His name is Hemant Shah.

952
01:03:36,388 --> 01:03:38,802
Some of my boss' friends
work in his office.

953
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:40,653
They keep giving tips.

954
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,221
When the boss sells, I do too.

955
01:03:43,301 --> 01:03:45,293
Last week I made 7000 rupees.

956
01:03:58,858 --> 01:03:59,859
What is it?

957
01:04:00,477 --> 01:04:02,408
Meera Rao's fifth article about you.

958
01:04:02,883 --> 01:04:04,747
She says Hemant Shah is just a bubble.

959
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,257
I don't know what her problem is.

960
01:04:08,648 --> 01:04:09,544
Bubble.

961
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:13,776
I thought I was like an earthquake.

962
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:15,080
Disaster.

963
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:19,022
Okay, fine.

964
01:04:20,021 --> 01:04:25,679
Give a front-page ad
in next week's newspaper...

965
01:04:26,918 --> 01:04:30,471
The title will be Hemant Shah is a Liar.

966
01:04:31,222 --> 01:04:32,697
She is calling us a liar, isn't she?

967
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:35,619
We'll answer all of her questions.

968
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:36,830
What else.

969
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:47,622
See this... he's the real big bull.

970
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:49,459
That Meera took five jabs at him

971
01:04:49,539 --> 01:04:52,328
but he knocked her out
with a single punch.

972
01:04:52,408 --> 01:04:55,147
Now we will have
to work with four hands.

973
01:04:55,227 --> 01:04:57,529
- Get the Indian Oil file quickly.
- Right away.

974
01:04:59,592 --> 01:05:01,562
Look! We have progressed.

975
01:05:08,657 --> 01:05:13,611
[chanting prayers]

976
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:18,224
[chanting prayers]

977
01:05:18,304 --> 01:05:23,352
Everytime I say 'swaha',
you'll pour the incense in the fire

978
01:05:23,432 --> 01:05:25,209
- Okay, priest.
- with these three fingers.

979
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:26,049
Okay?

980
01:05:26,129 --> 01:05:29,497
[chanting prayers]

981
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:33,194
[chanting prayers]

982
01:05:33,274 --> 01:05:36,617
[chanting prayers]

983
01:05:58,463 --> 01:06:00,582
Meera Rao called again.

984
01:06:01,203 --> 01:06:03,616
She's challenging you to an interview.
But I said no.

985
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:07,186
But didn't we decide
we'll do the interview?

986
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,612
She's trying to use
your name to gain some fame.

987
01:06:12,831 --> 01:06:15,079
The entire country's
making money using my name.

988
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:19,120
If she wants to gain some fame,
then let her.

989
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:30,064
'This ancient land
of India regains its glory'

990
01:06:30,144 --> 01:06:33,165
'and rightful place
in the Economy of our nation.'

991
01:06:33,245 --> 01:06:35,717
'This budget represents
the contribution...'

992
01:06:35,797 --> 01:06:39,007
'It's being believed
that the liberalisation policy'

993
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:40,501
'has been completely
inducted in the country.'

994
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:43,191
'And the product
which are presently accepting'

995
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:45,807
'10% rate of interest instead of 15.'

996
01:06:48,895 --> 01:06:51,395
Excuse me, is Viren Shah in?

997
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:53,493
- Your name?
- What did I ask?

998
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:56,058
Is Viren Shah in the office?

999
01:06:56,488 --> 01:06:57,545
Yes, sir.

1000
01:06:57,943 --> 01:06:59,168
Come in, everyone.

1001
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,328
- Rashid.
- Yes, sir.

1002
01:07:00,408 --> 01:07:01,932
Freeze the Accounts department.

1003
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,488
Come on, remove it.

1004
01:07:09,937 --> 01:07:12,682
Calm down everyone and listen carefully.

1005
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,446
- Move.
- Pass this.

1006
01:07:14,752 --> 01:07:16,324
The office has been raided.

1007
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:18,962
- Come on, get out.
- What is going on?

1008
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,306
- Where is Viren?
- In the office!

1009
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:24,721
No one's going to touch the computer,
file, or telephone.

1010
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:26,536
- Keep it down.
- No one will ask anything.

1011
01:07:26,616 --> 01:07:28,360
Please bring that blue file.

1012
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:31,531
Sir, we're ready for you.

1013
01:07:31,611 --> 01:07:33,874
Three. Two. One. Go.

1014
01:07:34,703 --> 01:07:36,279
Hello, and welcome.

1015
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:38,921
My today's guest is the man
who's all over the media.

1016
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:41,247
And he's known as The Big Bull.

1017
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,798
Seize everything.
Copy everything. Fast!

1018
01:07:58,281 --> 01:07:59,277
Rashid.

1019
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:06,672
Where are the records
for this entry of Indian Oil?

1020
01:08:06,752 --> 01:08:08,966
Where is the entry
for this 5 crore rupees?

1021
01:08:09,046 --> 01:08:09,930
Atul.

1022
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:11,635
Nikhil, did you find anything?

1023
01:08:11,984 --> 01:08:12,931
Nothing.

1024
01:08:13,874 --> 01:08:16,769
Okay. Get aggressive.

1025
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,596
Threaten, abuse, do whatever you can.

1026
01:08:20,676 --> 01:08:22,964
I need the information at any cost.

1027
01:08:23,044 --> 01:08:25,410
- But that's against the rules.
- Forget the rules, Nikhil.

1028
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:28,381
I need information, that's it. Clear?

1029
01:08:30,257 --> 01:08:31,266
Right?

1030
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:37,887
Mr. Hemant,
our stock market is at an all-time high

1031
01:08:38,498 --> 01:08:40,304
with a huge contribution from you.

1032
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:44,502
But this sudden boom looks artificial.

1033
01:08:45,076 --> 01:08:46,510
What's your comment on it?

1034
01:08:56,856 --> 01:09:01,633
The shares of our big companies
are with their owner's families.

1035
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,599
That's why they are undervalued.

1036
01:09:05,096 --> 01:09:08,741
If they release some of their stocks,
only then will their valuation increase.

1037
01:09:10,107 --> 01:09:12,894
This way, the company didn't just lower
the net worth of their companies

1038
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:15,332
but also of the country.

1039
01:09:16,788 --> 01:09:19,657
Do you know
that the gold reserves of our country

1040
01:09:19,737 --> 01:09:21,588
which has a population of 60 crore

1041
01:09:21,668 --> 01:09:24,501
is mortgaged with the Bank of England
and Bank of Japan.

1042
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,703
I want to ask Ms. Meera,
isn't this embarrassing?

1043
01:09:36,953 --> 01:09:38,902
Go handle outside. I'll handle it here.

1044
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,715
Couldn't you inform me earlier?

1045
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:54,315
We had a deal.

1046
01:09:55,106 --> 01:09:56,314
Who did you make this payment too?

1047
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:57,761
Didn't we have a deal?

1048
01:09:57,841 --> 01:09:59,222
Answer me!

1049
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:01,822
Who did you make this payment too?

1050
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,496
I believe your replacement
cost theory is right

1051
01:10:08,112 --> 01:10:10,673
but I don't think that can bring
such a boom in the market.

1052
01:10:11,647 --> 01:10:13,317
Maybe it can cause something else.

1053
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:17,904
Hope.

1054
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:21,703
Small word,
but it's bigger than it looks.

1055
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,274
The world clings on it.

1056
01:10:23,539 --> 01:10:25,201
Please, Mr. Hemant, logic...

1057
01:10:25,281 --> 01:10:26,518
I am coming to the logic, Ms. Meera.

1058
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:29,728
You want to hear it in your words.
Let's explain it in her terms.

1059
01:10:31,176 --> 01:10:34,808
The new boom has ushered
in the hope of liberalisation.

1060
01:10:36,189 --> 01:10:39,509
Believe me,
foreign investors are going to come.

1061
01:10:39,589 --> 01:10:41,174
They will invest their money here.

1062
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:43,797
The industry will see a great surge.

1063
01:10:44,421 --> 01:10:46,821
The valuation of current
will increase many folds.

1064
01:10:47,468 --> 01:10:50,214
You're watching
the boom of India's hope.

1065
01:10:50,294 --> 01:10:52,969
Mr. Hemant, let's talk about
the stock market and share prices first.

1066
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:57,308
Tell me... a share that cost 20 rupees
has now reached 200 rupees.

1067
01:10:57,758 --> 01:10:59,997
Where did the money come from?

1068
01:11:00,577 --> 01:11:01,998
Did this money come
from the 'bank of hope'?

1069
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:04,874
Even you know
that these prices are too inflated.

1070
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:06,815
It's just money play.

1071
01:11:10,752 --> 01:11:13,054
Even 200 rupees is too less, Ms. Meera.

1072
01:11:14,764 --> 01:11:16,761
Let me ask you a question. Okay?

1073
01:11:17,465 --> 01:11:21,114
Ten years ago you bought
some shares for 20 rupees.

1074
01:11:21,623 --> 01:11:24,478
And now that value of
those shares is 200 rupees.

1075
01:11:24,558 --> 01:11:28,012
Will you still ask me questions or sell
those shares for 200 rupees and party?

1076
01:11:47,587 --> 01:11:49,460
Why has this figure been scratched here?

1077
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:51,847
What's the original figure?

1078
01:12:17,272 --> 01:12:18,650
No matter what you say, Mr. Hemant

1079
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:22,450
but I believe this steep increase
in share prices is not normal at all.

1080
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,307
It can prove to be a disaster
for ordinary people.

1081
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,712
Currently, you're the
biggest player in this market.

1082
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:31,538
What is your advice
for ordinary investors?

1083
01:12:34,839 --> 01:12:36,229
Just that...

1084
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:40,114
We stopped thinking big.

1085
01:12:43,316 --> 01:12:46,323
The British didn't just take
the Kohinoor (diamond)

1086
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,666
but even our ideologies,
our self-confidence, everything.

1087
01:12:50,472 --> 01:12:54,152
I want to teach India to think big.

1088
01:12:54,232 --> 01:12:57,384
I want to tell our people to think big.

1089
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:01,222
Don't give them dreams
that may never come true.

1090
01:13:01,984 --> 01:13:02,940
Look, ma'am...

1091
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:06,992
He'll give us dreams
and also make them come true.

1092
01:13:07,324 --> 01:13:11,967
And you know, there weren't so
many opportunities until four-years-ago.

1093
01:13:12,047 --> 01:13:14,513
Either property or gold.

1094
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:18,768
Thanks to Hemant sir we can
double our money in a couple of months.

1095
01:13:18,848 --> 01:13:20,813
And we also get what we want.

1096
01:13:20,893 --> 01:13:22,828
Like a fridge, TV, or motorbike!

1097
01:13:22,908 --> 01:13:24,417
And also go on holidays.

1098
01:13:24,497 --> 01:13:25,821
Another thing, ma'am!

1099
01:13:26,282 --> 01:13:30,873
Thanks to Hemant sir, even an
ordinary man can invest in the market.

1100
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:32,975
And buy shares of any company.

1101
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:37,792
For the first time,
even feel a part of the Indian economy.

1102
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,842
Otherwise...
only a handful of businessmen

1103
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:43,171
and a couple of brokers
used to play this game.

1104
01:13:44,968 --> 01:13:49,090
Look madam, I am selling my gold,
property, everything.

1105
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,888
Only to invest in stocks.

1106
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:53,487
And Hemant sir's word is the ultimate.

1107
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:56,959
If he says that stock prices will go up,
means it will go up.

1108
01:14:27,635 --> 01:14:29,973
I saved you today,
but I can't do it everyday.

1109
01:14:30,314 --> 01:14:33,538
Then you keep writing
any amount of numbers on paper

1110
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:35,121
but it won't help you.

1111
01:14:35,478 --> 01:14:38,352
Tell your brother that
he's flying too high...

1112
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,042
And that too without a parachute.

1113
01:14:40,474 --> 01:14:43,157
If he tries to land,
it'll be a crash-landing

1114
01:14:43,237 --> 01:14:44,473
straight into jail. Understand.

1115
01:14:47,949 --> 01:14:51,974
You see, madam,
earlier businessmen like me

1116
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:56,906
would keep 75-90% shares
in their name or their family.

1117
01:14:56,986 --> 01:14:59,780
We had to take a loan from
the bank to expand our business.

1118
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:04,889
Thanks to Hemant sir,
we didn't just learn to make profit

1119
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:09,132
but also on how to increase
the value of our shares by selling them.

1120
01:15:11,515 --> 01:15:14,721
Now we feel we've got our India back.

1121
01:15:16,405 --> 01:15:17,875
Hemant! Hemant!

1122
01:15:17,955 --> 01:15:20,718
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

1123
01:15:20,798 --> 01:15:23,258
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

1124
01:15:23,338 --> 01:15:25,776
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

1125
01:15:25,856 --> 01:15:28,530
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

1126
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:31,228
Big Bull! Big Bull! Big Bull!

1127
01:15:31,308 --> 01:15:33,851
Big Bull! Big Bull! Big Bull!

1128
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:37,193
Big Bull! Big Bull! Big Bull!

1129
01:15:38,481 --> 01:15:39,649
'Are you ashamed?'

1130
01:15:40,396 --> 01:15:41,703
'You've humiliated all of us.'

1131
01:15:45,245 --> 01:15:47,362
'Otherwise,
God knows what else he would've done.'

1132
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,671
'Please...'

1133
01:15:48,751 --> 01:15:50,147
- 'Get out now.
- No, no...'

1134
01:15:50,227 --> 01:15:52,663
'He made a mistake.
He won't do it again.'

1135
01:15:52,743 --> 01:15:55,028
- 'Please, papa...
-Tell him. Tell him.'

1136
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:56,763
'You're going to sleep outside tonight.'

1137
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,607
- No one's going to feed him.
- No.

1138
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:01,157
Hemant, please... don't hit him.

1139
01:16:20,026 --> 01:16:22,579
- What happened?
- Hemant sir, any tip?

1140
01:16:35,028 --> 01:16:36,258
Do you have a car?

1141
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:39,455
Car? You must be joking, sir?

1142
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:43,480
Do you want one?

1143
01:16:50,101 --> 01:16:53,522
Before you buy a car, buy a tyre.

1144
01:16:57,573 --> 01:16:59,663
And only of KVG.

1145
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,867
What?

1146
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:22,683
This IT raid was just a warning.

1147
01:17:23,371 --> 01:17:24,919
I had a personal chat with the officer.

1148
01:17:26,411 --> 01:17:28,132
We should slow down now.

1149
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:34,198
I can't tread slow, Viren.

1150
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,849
If the government and
system want to catch me

1151
01:17:38,929 --> 01:17:41,429
then they will have
to increase their speed.

1152
01:17:42,093 --> 01:17:43,953
Where will you take Mile High?

1153
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:45,858
It's enough.

1154
01:17:47,226 --> 01:17:49,679
If this continues I am telling you,
I'll resign.

1155
01:17:52,456 --> 01:17:54,214
We already have so much.

1156
01:17:56,943 --> 01:17:58,896
You're issuing cheques
worth crores of rupees.

1157
01:17:59,233 --> 01:18:00,908
I don't know what
banks we're dealing with.

1158
01:18:00,988 --> 01:18:02,504
What companies are we dealing with?

1159
01:18:03,248 --> 01:18:04,515
Maybe you don't know either.

1160
01:18:05,237 --> 01:18:07,194
The banks don't know
where their money is going.

1161
01:18:07,274 --> 01:18:09,462
They are all happy. Everyone thinks
they are making a lot of money.

1162
01:18:11,463 --> 01:18:14,058
This is not normal. I am scared.

1163
01:18:14,983 --> 01:18:16,626
I want a normal life, brother.

1164
01:18:17,162 --> 01:18:19,279
We have a family.
We'll have kids tomorrow.

1165
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:23,555
Why don't you understand?

1166
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,152
Last time when you did
something like this

1167
01:18:26,232 --> 01:18:27,863
you had to sleep on your footwear.
Remember?

1168
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,288
That won't happen again. Don't worry.

1169
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:37,785
Because I have

1170
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:42,996
the ace of cards up my sleeve.

1171
01:18:48,547 --> 01:18:49,553
Who? The CM?

1172
01:18:50,471 --> 01:18:51,732
Bigger than him.

1173
01:18:52,883 --> 01:18:54,289
Finance Secretary?

1174
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:57,761
Finance Minister?

1175
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:02,788
Not the king of cards...

1176
01:19:04,555 --> 01:19:05,476
I said ace.

1177
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:41,329
I'll be right back.

1178
01:19:48,537 --> 01:19:49,591
Take.

1179
01:19:50,648 --> 01:19:51,467
Take...

1180
01:19:55,407 --> 01:19:57,073
There's no need for this.

1181
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:00,511
You've been handing out
a lot by yourself these days.

1182
01:20:00,591 --> 01:20:04,504
You see, where did the Robin hood
inside me have woken?

1183
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:05,930
In the stock market.

1184
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:10,090
Whatever that's inside you...
will one day send you to jail.

1185
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,702
I see...
did you bring in some new law?

1186
01:20:12,782 --> 01:20:15,958
I haven't... the law already exists.

1187
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:19,239
And nothing will help you.

1188
01:20:20,008 --> 01:20:22,162
I've already given you this advice once.

1189
01:20:22,668 --> 01:20:23,897
I won't give again.

1190
01:20:26,008 --> 01:20:28,860
A man who makes money
from others' failures

1191
01:20:29,732 --> 01:20:31,581
I don't need his advice.

1192
01:20:32,669 --> 01:20:33,724
What did you say?

1193
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:38,376
Doesn't matter how many times you
come to pray to this temple, Malpani

1194
01:20:39,616 --> 01:20:41,281
that won't change the fact

1195
01:20:41,834 --> 01:20:46,413
that you make money
when the share market slumps.

1196
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:52,065
The man who prays
the down fall of the share market.

1197
01:20:52,983 --> 01:20:53,958
That's you.

1198
01:20:55,014 --> 01:20:57,895
Your success lies in others' failure.

1199
01:20:58,907 --> 01:20:59,857
But...

1200
01:21:00,783 --> 01:21:06,693
Today when the market's going up,
only one man is losing.

1201
01:21:07,303 --> 01:21:09,109
Even I can make small talk.

1202
01:21:09,951 --> 01:21:11,113
And since I'm from the market

1203
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:15,074
I know this language which
you'll understand better.

1204
01:21:16,358 --> 01:21:21,061
But since we're in a temple,
I'll give you one piece of advice.

1205
01:21:21,609 --> 01:21:27,110
When a man goes up, up and up...
he comes down, down and down.

1206
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,991
And falls flat in the end.

1207
01:21:31,398 --> 01:21:32,844
Remember that.

1208
01:21:34,524 --> 01:21:35,948
I know how to fly...

1209
01:21:37,408 --> 01:21:39,267
Learn to look up.

1210
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:50,891
Let's go, we'll finish this tomorrow.

1211
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:53,174
Give me 10 more minutes,
then we'll leave.

1212
01:21:53,254 --> 01:21:54,723
What isn't tallying?

1213
01:21:58,006 --> 01:21:59,273
Something's odd.

1214
01:22:00,623 --> 01:22:04,051
We've Bank Receipts,
but I don't see the money in the books.

1215
01:22:04,131 --> 01:22:05,340
Is that all?

1216
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,421
Forget it. We'll tally it tomorrow.
How does it matter?

1217
01:22:09,566 --> 01:22:11,916
565 crores are missing.

1218
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:13,731
Are you joking?

1219
01:22:15,728 --> 01:22:18,115
- Check it yourself.
- There might be some mistake.

1220
01:22:27,207 --> 01:22:28,220
What's this, Meera?

1221
01:22:28,684 --> 01:22:30,136
- What is what?
- Seriously.

1222
01:22:31,692 --> 01:22:35,358
Now you're implying that Hemant
has links with the underworld.

1223
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:38,035
I am just questioning
where he's getting funds from.

1224
01:22:38,344 --> 01:22:39,694
Somebody has to be funding him.

1225
01:22:40,105 --> 01:22:43,007
The underworld is already funding films.
They can fund Hemant too.

1226
01:22:43,087 --> 01:22:44,319
They can.

1227
01:22:45,754 --> 01:22:47,786
Come here. Come, come.

1228
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:51,112
You see the construction cranes?

1229
01:22:51,865 --> 01:22:55,057
I spent my entire life in this city.

1230
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,676
And I'll be honest with you.

1231
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,333
I've never seen this city
change so drastically.

1232
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:06,060
It's like... India is reborn.

1233
01:23:08,712 --> 01:23:12,586
If Hemant is wrong,
then all this is wrong.

1234
01:23:14,677 --> 01:23:16,089
Hemant is definitely wrong

1235
01:23:16,963 --> 01:23:19,243
but you decide about the rest.

1236
01:23:27,197 --> 01:23:28,592
Cheers!

1237
01:23:31,613 --> 01:23:32,954
Please come, sir.

1238
01:23:34,899 --> 01:23:38,947
Wow! She's more beautiful
than she looks in films.

1239
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:44,212
- Isn't she?
- Yes.

1240
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:45,521
And that Vikram.

1241
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:47,668
We Gujaratis are on a roll.

1242
01:23:50,184 --> 01:23:53,371
By the way,
Hemant, do you have any regrets

1243
01:23:53,751 --> 01:23:56,668
about marrying an ordinary girl
even though you're so rich.

1244
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:01,674
I hadn't thought about it yet
but now when I look at them

1245
01:24:01,754 --> 01:24:04,389
I think I should've thought about it.

1246
01:24:05,076 --> 01:24:06,191
Hemant!

1247
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,865
By the way, Bombay is now
entirely controlled by Gujarat.

1248
01:24:16,237 --> 01:24:18,508
They can buy one half,
and we can buy the other.

1249
01:24:18,588 --> 01:24:21,997
Oh yes, last week my
friend Anjali was telling me

1250
01:24:22,077 --> 01:24:25,478
that Solanki will be
the first billionaire of India.

1251
01:24:26,178 --> 01:24:27,966
- Really?
- Why didn't you interrupt Anjali?

1252
01:24:28,046 --> 01:24:29,064
About what?

1253
01:24:29,144 --> 01:24:31,371
The billionaire part.

1254
01:24:31,451 --> 01:24:34,515
But she is right.
What did she say wrong?

1255
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,928
You should know the truth.

1256
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:47,949
I'll be India's first billionaire.

1257
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:50,664
Me.

1258
01:24:52,523 --> 01:24:55,840
Not him or anyone else.

1259
01:25:07,452 --> 01:25:10,609
Sir! Mr. Venkateshwar
has called for you.

1260
01:25:11,025 --> 01:25:12,888
- Mr. Venkateshwar?
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:25:12,968 --> 01:25:14,545
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1262
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:18,661
Mr. Viren, it's a catastrophe.

1263
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:24,401
The bank found out
that the money is missing.

1264
01:25:25,392 --> 01:25:31,526
Please tell Hemant to return
all the money right now.

1265
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:33,466
How much money is missing?

1266
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,141
565 crores.

1267
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:42,505
Please, Viren. Tell him immediately,
otherwise...I'll be ruined.

1268
01:25:43,532 --> 01:25:44,653
Please.

1269
01:25:44,733 --> 01:25:46,285
Please, for God's sake.

1270
01:26:05,473 --> 01:26:06,625
Good to see you.

1271
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:09,335
Your face is everywhere.

1272
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,818
Dad was just praising you yesterday.

1273
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:15,923
Wow... great ride.

1274
01:26:17,862 --> 01:26:18,862
You like it?

1275
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,201
Keep it.

1276
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:24,287
I'll buy two more.

1277
01:26:26,611 --> 01:26:27,939
Tell papa, I said hi.

1278
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:57,164
Hey... where did you find this?

1279
01:26:57,416 --> 01:26:59,541
It was stuck under the xerox machine.

1280
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,501
Well done, Amit.

1281
01:27:10,591 --> 01:27:16,785
Hemant Shah receives
his first BR on Monday

1282
01:27:17,168 --> 01:27:18,489
which he

1283
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:25,074
doesn't dispatch to any other bank until

1284
01:27:26,001 --> 01:27:27,967
the second week's Thursday or Friday.

1285
01:27:30,053 --> 01:27:35,459
And we get to see this
pattern in every transaction.

1286
01:27:37,602 --> 01:27:38,587
Hey!

1287
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:46,229
It was all much ado about nothing.

1288
01:27:47,056 --> 01:27:49,027
Rascal...

1289
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:55,531
We thought this money's
coming from the Middle-East

1290
01:27:56,501 --> 01:28:00,398
the Underworld, Politicians, but...

1291
01:28:04,627 --> 01:28:07,120
This turned out to be
money from our banks.

1292
01:28:13,797 --> 01:28:16,613
I know how to clip wings.

1293
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:21,915
Get used to falling, Hemant Shah.

1294
01:28:23,429 --> 01:28:27,641
'Don't travel near the door.
And don't try to...'

1295
01:28:37,369 --> 01:28:40,036
Hi, I am Ashima.

1296
01:28:40,412 --> 01:28:42,946
Aren't you Meera Rao, the journalist?

1297
01:28:43,492 --> 01:28:44,324
Yes.

1298
01:28:47,547 --> 01:28:51,706
By the way,
what school did you do journalism from?

1299
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,625
Are you interviewing a journalist?

1300
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:58,518
- Are you interested in journalism?
- Yes, a little.

1301
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:06,117
I wanted to ask
why you chose financial people?

1302
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:09,333
I just had an interest.

1303
01:29:10,112 --> 01:29:12,256
That's my station.

1304
01:29:13,241 --> 01:29:16,365
- Bye. Nice to meet you.
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

1305
01:29:28,514 --> 01:29:29,488
Take.

1306
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,282
'And finally,
I received a big tip in this case.'

1307
01:29:38,362 --> 01:29:41,651
'NBI,
from where a lot of money was missing.'

1308
01:29:41,731 --> 01:29:45,402
'It's manager Venkateshwar
is the key to Hemant's vault.'

1309
01:30:18,777 --> 01:30:22,039
Meera, speaking.
Call Sudeep from room no. 20, please.

1310
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:25,008
Hurry up.

1311
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:35,535
From now on, you'll stand downstairs.

1312
01:30:35,615 --> 01:30:38,430
And tell me when
Venkateshwar arrives. Okay?

1313
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:40,195
Ma'am. Ma'am.

1314
01:30:45,906 --> 01:30:47,520
Mr. Raman. Senior manager.

1315
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,848
- Your name?
- Meera Rao, India Times.

1316
01:30:49,928 --> 01:30:50,860
Please, wait.

1317
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:53,445
The money will come back.

1318
01:30:54,013 --> 01:30:56,795
We got 135 crores back.
The rest will come too.

1319
01:30:57,108 --> 01:30:58,250
But, sir...

1320
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:01,888
Yes.

1321
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,045
Hello, sir, Meera Rao here to see you.

1322
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,720
She wants to talk to you.

1323
01:31:06,643 --> 01:31:08,547
Send her in after two minutes.

1324
01:31:10,289 --> 01:31:11,926
You must wait for two minutes ma'am.

1325
01:31:12,406 --> 01:31:13,971
His office is on the first floor,
isn't it?

1326
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:15,211
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1327
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:16,278
Wait a minute.

1328
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:21,056
Go now. I've an important meeting.

1329
01:31:25,442 --> 01:31:26,254
Hello.

1330
01:31:26,839 --> 01:31:29,056
- Sir.
- Checkout of the hotel.

1331
01:31:30,039 --> 01:31:32,470
Stay hidden in your hometown
for two weeks.

1332
01:31:33,123 --> 01:31:36,181
- Don't answer anyone's calls.
- I'll leave tonight, sir.

1333
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:40,168
I'll come straight to the point.

1334
01:31:40,248 --> 01:31:43,255
I know about the missing money.
565 crores.

1335
01:31:43,335 --> 01:31:45,791
And I'm doing a story on it.
I need your statement.

1336
01:31:46,253 --> 01:31:47,979
Tea or coffee, Meera?

1337
01:31:48,681 --> 01:31:49,991
Let's just get to the point.

1338
01:31:56,521 --> 01:31:58,951
Someone gave you wrong information.

1339
01:31:59,832 --> 01:32:01,406
There is no money missing.

1340
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:04,207
Look Meera

1341
01:32:05,403 --> 01:32:11,152
banks invest around 60 billion
within themselves.

1342
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:16,461
And reconciliation takes time.

1343
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:18,706
There's nothing wrong.

1344
01:32:22,025 --> 01:32:25,196
- Sir is not taking it seriously.
- I also feel the same.

1345
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:45,893
'I was on the right track.
The money was actually money.'

1346
01:32:46,531 --> 01:32:48,593
'I just had to crack Venkateshwar.'

1347
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:50,919
Hello, ma'am.

1348
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:09,142
- Yes?
- Mr. Venkateshwar, my name is Rama Mir.

1349
01:33:09,222 --> 01:33:10,878
- Madam...
- I am the bank's lawyer.

1350
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:13,815
The news has reached the media,
so the bank's sent me to you.

1351
01:33:14,156 --> 01:33:15,569
But, ma'am...

1352
01:33:16,614 --> 01:33:18,793
Don't worry,
I won't tell anyone anything.

1353
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,087
A doctor never tells
anyone about his patients

1354
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:22,801
nor does a lawyer about his clients.

1355
01:33:23,629 --> 01:33:25,236
Attorney-client privilege.

1356
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,048
It's okay, you can trust me.

1357
01:33:30,703 --> 01:33:31,801
Okay.

1358
01:33:34,101 --> 01:33:36,882
I'll tell you.

1359
01:33:37,275 --> 01:33:40,183
Hemant is a very smart man, madam.

1360
01:33:40,263 --> 01:33:43,886
He took advantage of
the banking system's weakness.

1361
01:33:45,776 --> 01:33:51,529
This is Bank A, Bank B, Bank C

1362
01:33:52,366 --> 01:33:55,138
and Bank D.

1363
01:33:55,904 --> 01:34:00,509
Bank A gives a loan
to Bank B for two weeks.

1364
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:04,132
But through broker Hemant.

1365
01:34:05,558 --> 01:34:08,640
Two weeks later when
it's time to return the loan

1366
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:11,821
then Hemant takes a loan from Bank C

1367
01:34:11,901 --> 01:34:13,324
and gives to Bank B

1368
01:34:13,965 --> 01:34:17,749
then gives Bank C's loan from Bank D.

1369
01:34:17,829 --> 01:34:20,866
And gives Bank D's loan from Bank B.

1370
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:23,724
And then from this bank and so on.

1371
01:34:24,372 --> 01:34:26,425
Then he's just rotating
the bank's money.

1372
01:34:26,505 --> 01:34:27,554
What's the issue?

1373
01:34:28,303 --> 01:34:30,827
He's not just rotating the money.

1374
01:34:31,507 --> 01:34:35,083
He's investing all
the money in stock markets.

1375
01:34:35,163 --> 01:34:37,580
The share prices are increasing

1376
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:40,880
and he's enjoying all the profit.

1377
01:34:41,579 --> 01:34:47,534
Keeping the bank's money
for two week's is not a big deal.

1378
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:54,636
But investing that money in
the stock market is absolutely illegal.

1379
01:34:56,484 --> 01:34:59,057
There are numerous banks,
countless cash.

1380
01:34:59,633 --> 01:35:05,504
Reconciliation takes a lot of time,
and Hemant knew that.

1381
01:35:06,031 --> 01:35:09,103
And he's making a fortune
by taking advantage of this.

1382
01:35:12,507 --> 01:35:15,998
It all started with a few millions.

1383
01:35:16,817 --> 01:35:19,971
But his greediness grew many folds

1384
01:35:20,051 --> 01:35:26,743
and he has to return
565 crores to the bank.

1385
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:31,569
Wait a second. Wait a second.
The cheques that you give to the broker

1386
01:35:31,649 --> 01:35:33,694
I mean, where are the agreements?

1387
01:35:40,212 --> 01:35:44,449
Oh, God!

1388
01:35:52,505 --> 01:35:59,765
It's entirely
the banking system's mistake.

1389
01:36:00,856 --> 01:36:02,457
Absolutely.

1390
01:36:03,782 --> 01:36:06,609
Hemant's name is on the cheques.

1391
01:36:09,061 --> 01:36:14,269
The banking system doesn't
have a specific law.

1392
01:36:16,972 --> 01:36:21,750
Hemant knew about this grey area

1393
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:25,528
and Hemant's making a fortune
taking advantage of it.

1394
01:36:27,001 --> 01:36:30,886
Imagine that the banking system

1395
01:36:31,684 --> 01:36:38,216
itself gifted this scam
to Hemant on a plate.

1396
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:43,152
And it did not stop here,
the worst part was...

1397
01:36:44,489 --> 01:36:47,800
He started issuing fake BRs.

1398
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:55,309
There's real BR's and fake BR's
circulated in the market.

1399
01:36:55,389 --> 01:36:57,177
It's circulated.

1400
01:36:57,997 --> 01:37:05,295
And we're unable to check, find
out the original from the fake ones.

1401
01:37:10,317 --> 01:37:13,876
How much has Hemant returned
from the 565 crores?

1402
01:37:19,017 --> 01:37:20,900
135 crores.

1403
01:37:21,312 --> 01:37:23,827
And where did Hemant
get this 135 crores?

1404
01:37:25,752 --> 01:37:28,732
Central Housing Bank. CHB.

1405
01:37:30,176 --> 01:37:32,699
So that's where he got 135 crores.

1406
01:37:34,408 --> 01:37:36,994
But how did Hemant get access to CHB?

1407
01:37:38,291 --> 01:37:40,120
It's the country's treasury!

1408
01:37:57,537 --> 01:37:58,683
Have a biscuit?

1409
01:37:58,763 --> 01:38:01,627
I wish they were made of gold instead.

1410
01:38:01,707 --> 01:38:04,217
- Sir!
- Meet, Mr. Manu Maalpani.

1411
01:38:05,619 --> 01:38:06,465
Meera Rao.

1412
01:38:08,293 --> 01:38:09,342
Hello.

1413
01:38:09,422 --> 01:38:10,718
- Hello.
- Meera, sit.

1414
01:38:10,995 --> 01:38:12,054
I am alright, sir.

1415
01:38:12,723 --> 01:38:14,391
I've some shocking news for you.

1416
01:38:15,068 --> 01:38:17,058
It seems like Mr. Hemant Shah

1417
01:38:17,802 --> 01:38:20,895
was investing the bank's
money in the stock market all along.

1418
01:38:21,311 --> 01:38:22,307
I know, sir.

1419
01:38:22,909 --> 01:38:26,050
I also know that 565 crores
is missing from NBI.

1420
01:38:26,643 --> 01:38:28,547
- Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1421
01:38:29,025 --> 01:38:30,664
When did you find that out?

1422
01:38:31,368 --> 01:38:32,586
It's a good thing though

1423
01:38:33,148 --> 01:38:34,662
that you found out on your own.

1424
01:38:36,358 --> 01:38:40,344
If you had this information, then
why come here instead of the Police?

1425
01:38:43,177 --> 01:38:46,712
Because Meera,
this case doesn't belong to the Police.

1426
01:38:49,524 --> 01:38:51,289
It belongs to the CBI.

1427
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:58,130
And the CBI will investigate
when you print it.

1428
01:38:58,568 --> 01:39:01,478
Or you got this information
through some illegal channel

1429
01:39:01,558 --> 01:39:03,258
and you can't go to the Police.

1430
01:39:03,338 --> 01:39:05,609
Meera, the source of
information doesn't matter.

1431
01:39:07,366 --> 01:39:10,492
Our job is to investigate and report it.

1432
01:39:11,356 --> 01:39:14,782
Exactly, sir, if this information
leaks out without thorough investigation

1433
01:39:14,862 --> 01:39:16,828
then the markets will crash.

1434
01:39:17,554 --> 01:39:20,118
And we all know
who will benefit from that.

1435
01:39:30,469 --> 01:39:31,777
Sorry.

1436
01:39:41,411 --> 01:39:45,607
[Indistinct catter continue]

1437
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:50,535
What happened, brother?

1438
01:39:52,812 --> 01:39:54,140
Something's not right.

1439
01:39:56,149 --> 01:39:57,499
You know what

1440
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:02,504
invite the entire
top management over for dinner.

1441
01:40:03,312 --> 01:40:04,651
Why? What happened?

1442
01:40:05,227 --> 01:40:07,778
You said you've an ace up your sleeve.

1443
01:40:07,858 --> 01:40:09,892
Just do as I said.

1444
01:40:10,999 --> 01:40:12,493
Invite everyone to dinner.

1445
01:40:22,253 --> 01:40:24,705
Sir, why are you seeing in the pool?

1446
01:40:25,188 --> 01:40:26,502
Are you looking for hidden treasure?

1447
01:40:27,127 --> 01:40:29,522
What an amazing pool?

1448
01:40:29,897 --> 01:40:34,443
I want to take a plunge
right now...with my clothes on.

1449
01:40:36,237 --> 01:40:38,316
Come on, I'll give you a hand.

1450
01:40:38,396 --> 01:40:41,442
I'll invite you to lunch someday,
and you can swim all you want.

1451
01:40:41,522 --> 01:40:44,899
- Finish your drink for now.
- Great. You're the best boss ever.

1452
01:40:44,979 --> 01:40:45,953
Thank you so much, sir.

1453
01:40:46,033 --> 01:40:48,194
- Guys, it's the boss.
- You're absolutely right.

1454
01:40:50,218 --> 01:40:54,315
Why wait for tomorrow
when you can do it today?

1455
01:40:57,860 --> 01:40:58,639
Come on.

1456
01:41:00,533 --> 01:41:01,865
Take your clothes off.

1457
01:41:03,841 --> 01:41:05,810
- Sir...
- You're really funny, sir.

1458
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,456
- You're really funny.
- You're really funny.

1459
01:41:07,536 --> 01:41:09,896
Why are you all laughing
when I didn't crack a joke?

1460
01:41:21,721 --> 01:41:25,439
Take your clothes off
and get in the pool.

1461
01:41:26,487 --> 01:41:27,277
Now.

1462
01:41:30,442 --> 01:41:32,069
What are you doing?

1463
01:41:34,622 --> 01:41:40,792
One of them is recording
our secrets and leaking them.

1464
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:47,794
So let's find out...

1465
01:41:48,985 --> 01:41:50,448
Who's wearing a mic.

1466
01:41:55,204 --> 01:41:58,272
Take your clothes off.

1467
01:41:59,069 --> 01:42:00,176
Now!

1468
01:42:50,784 --> 01:42:53,904
Ma'am, NBI has issued a denial.

1469
01:42:53,984 --> 01:42:55,769
-What?
- They claim there's no scam.

1470
01:42:59,971 --> 01:43:01,557
Sir...

1471
01:43:01,637 --> 01:43:03,726
Sir, please sir...

1472
01:43:03,806 --> 01:43:05,514
Hear-hear...

1473
01:43:05,594 --> 01:43:08,622
There is no news here
or anything out of place.

1474
01:43:08,977 --> 01:43:10,646
No need to panic.

1475
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:14,270
As the bank said,
it's just a reconciliation problem.

1476
01:43:14,617 --> 01:43:16,938
Everything will be
settled in a few days.

1477
01:43:17,018 --> 01:43:19,140
- Mr. Shah...
- Sir, sir...

1478
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,255
Will it be just this bank

1479
01:43:20,335 --> 01:43:23,638
or should we prepare for a
press conference outside all the banks?

1480
01:43:24,648 --> 01:43:27,189
I am sure all the banks
have asked you for the accounts.

1481
01:43:32,065 --> 01:43:33,383
Sir, sir...

1482
01:43:33,463 --> 01:43:35,783
Sir, sir...

1483
01:43:35,863 --> 01:43:38,595
Sir, sir...

1484
01:43:42,542 --> 01:43:44,936
Ms. Meera... Hemant Shah.

1485
01:43:45,312 --> 01:43:46,818
I wanted to meet you.

1486
01:43:47,446 --> 01:43:48,452
What for?

1487
01:43:48,983 --> 01:43:52,032
Whoever meets me is always in profit.

1488
01:43:52,803 --> 01:43:53,963
Note down the address.

1489
01:43:54,969 --> 01:43:57,320
Swarna Bungalow, Madh Marve Road.

1490
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,296
Madh Island? Why so far?

1491
01:43:59,757 --> 01:44:01,506
What are you saying, Ms. Meera?

1492
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:06,917
Your journalist friends go all the way
to Switzerland, Sweden, for a story.

1493
01:44:06,997 --> 01:44:08,972
I am only calling you to Madh Island.

1494
01:44:09,371 --> 01:44:10,809
Come over.

1495
01:44:10,889 --> 01:44:13,470
There's a car waiting for you outside.

1496
01:44:27,064 --> 01:44:29,383
Welcome, Ms. Meera, welcome.

1497
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,346
Welcome to my weekend home.

1498
01:44:39,527 --> 01:44:40,709
Come in. Come in.

1499
01:44:48,834 --> 01:44:50,871
Do you have any interest in sports

1500
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:55,508
or do you only like
the game of toppling people?

1501
01:44:58,186 --> 01:44:59,857
Why did you call me here?

1502
01:45:06,022 --> 01:45:07,453
To celebrate.

1503
01:45:12,113 --> 01:45:13,101
Cheers!

1504
01:45:18,338 --> 01:45:21,721
You exposed the century's biggest scam.

1505
01:45:23,681 --> 01:45:27,539
Aren't you scared of the consequences
when this scam gets exposed?

1506
01:45:30,805 --> 01:45:32,342
You see, Ms. Meera

1507
01:45:33,416 --> 01:45:35,959
sometimes the newspapers
print the facts.

1508
01:45:39,231 --> 01:45:40,667
Look. Look here.

1509
01:45:40,747 --> 01:45:45,262
Just today,
your newspaper printed an opinion poll.

1510
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:49,355
64% of people are in my favour.

1511
01:45:49,435 --> 01:45:50,508
64...

1512
01:45:51,862 --> 01:45:55,582
Making money is an art, not a scam.

1513
01:45:57,214 --> 01:45:58,840
That's all I did.

1514
01:46:00,715 --> 01:46:02,481
I'll ask one last time.

1515
01:46:03,688 --> 01:46:05,406
Why did you call me here?

1516
01:46:14,504 --> 01:46:16,313
Who is your informer?

1517
01:46:21,293 --> 01:46:23,875
Who is the traitor, Ms. Meera?

1518
01:46:26,285 --> 01:46:29,982
And don't take Venkateshwar's name.

1519
01:46:31,769 --> 01:46:35,297
I want the name
that led you to Venkateshwar.

1520
01:46:46,503 --> 01:46:47,614
Name.

1521
01:46:50,468 --> 01:46:55,448
You know, for a while even
I was a part of those 64% people.

1522
01:46:56,981 --> 01:46:58,985
But then I found out the truth.

1523
01:47:00,201 --> 01:47:01,587
Fake BR's.

1524
01:47:03,341 --> 01:47:06,545
So stop thinking about the traitor
and find a good lawyer.

1525
01:47:07,705 --> 01:47:09,236
Because they are coming for you.

1526
01:47:14,158 --> 01:47:15,158
Excuse me.

1527
01:47:26,286 --> 01:47:28,496
'Cosmo Service Bank, BNZ Bank'

1528
01:47:28,576 --> 01:47:33,175
'Bank of City, Urban Seva and
many other banks have also found out'

1529
01:47:33,255 --> 01:47:36,454
'the Hemant Shah owes
them a lot of money.'

1530
01:47:39,432 --> 01:47:40,265
Hello!

1531
01:47:41,252 --> 01:47:42,454
Hemant bhai!

1532
01:47:43,596 --> 01:47:44,729
Yes, Hemant bhai.

1533
01:47:44,809 --> 01:47:46,360
How can I let you speak with them,
Hemant bhai?

1534
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:49,324
Sir is not around.
In fact, he isn't even in India.

1535
01:47:49,404 --> 01:47:50,744
He's not Hemant sir.

1536
01:47:50,824 --> 01:47:53,483
Okay, fine.
I'll call you as soon as he returns.

1537
01:48:07,545 --> 01:48:09,652
- 'NBI Bank and Bank of Satara'
- Open the door.

1538
01:48:09,732 --> 01:48:12,318
- 'has been hugely affected by the
Hemant Shah scam' - Hari, open the door.

1539
01:48:12,398 --> 01:48:13,939
'that they have run out of cash'

1540
01:48:14,019 --> 01:48:17,220
'and both banks
are on the verge of closing down.'

1541
01:48:20,089 --> 01:48:22,449
Mr. Hari, open the door. Can't you hear?

1542
01:48:22,793 --> 01:48:25,961
- 'There was an uproar at the Parliament
regarding the scam.' - Hey you, wait...

1543
01:48:26,223 --> 01:48:27,720
'The opposition leader has said'

1544
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,300
'that the Finance Minister
should tender his resignation.'

1545
01:48:31,956 --> 01:48:35,989
'The matter will be investigated
by JPC formed by the government.'

1546
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,062
Hey, come on...

1547
01:48:46,072 --> 01:48:47,683
Come out. Come on...

1548
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:50,067
Come on, bring him down. Bring him down.

1549
01:48:50,769 --> 01:48:52,546
Hemant sir's call...

1550
01:48:53,308 --> 01:48:54,356
Yes, Hemant bhai.

1551
01:48:55,037 --> 01:48:57,840
Pandey,
how many times do I have to call?

1552
01:48:58,124 --> 01:49:00,421
Last time you said
Sanjeev's gone abroad.

1553
01:49:01,077 --> 01:49:02,981
Now he's not even attending my calls.

1554
01:49:03,361 --> 01:49:05,037
What's going on?
Why isn't he answering my calls?

1555
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:07,198
He isn't even attending my calls.

1556
01:49:07,665 --> 01:49:08,851
The situation is pretty tense.

1557
01:49:09,362 --> 01:49:11,117
I think he's very busy.

1558
01:49:11,197 --> 01:49:13,271
I'll tell him to call
you back as soon as he returns.

1559
01:49:15,155 --> 01:49:17,783
God, make my day.

1560
01:49:32,339 --> 01:49:34,480
Please sir, let us go...

1561
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,806
Sir, sir...

1562
01:49:39,874 --> 01:49:42,109
- Get back. Come on.
- Sir, I...

1563
01:49:44,914 --> 01:49:46,242
We will require 1 more box.

1564
01:49:53,642 --> 01:49:54,660
Borkar.

1565
01:49:58,475 --> 01:50:01,180
Mr. Hemant, you must come with us.

1566
01:50:08,783 --> 01:50:10,705
Mom, I'll have to go with them.

1567
01:50:11,612 --> 01:50:16,340
My only mistake was that
I became too rich too soon.

1568
01:50:18,187 --> 01:50:21,466
Don't worry,
I'll come back to you in a week.

1569
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:23,357
Okay.

1570
01:50:26,144 --> 01:50:27,278
Be careful!

1571
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,183
Come back, Hemant.

1572
01:50:49,648 --> 01:50:51,308
This isn't your punishment alone.

1573
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:54,786
Until you don't come back, this
house will feel nothing short of jail.

1574
01:50:58,780 --> 01:50:59,877
Come, sir.

1575
01:51:02,448 --> 01:51:04,728
Sir, sir...

1576
01:51:04,808 --> 01:51:07,953
Sir, sir...

1577
01:51:08,033 --> 01:51:10,303
Sir, sir...

1578
01:51:10,383 --> 01:51:12,860
- Sir, sir...
- Move, move...

1579
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:16,756
[Indistinct chatter continue]

1580
01:51:21,798 --> 01:51:24,844
'The Big Bull Hemant Shah
and his brother Viren'

1581
01:51:24,924 --> 01:51:27,628
'were arrested by a CBI team today.'

1582
01:51:28,336 --> 01:51:30,077
'According to sources Hemant Shah'

1583
01:51:30,157 --> 01:51:33,063
'is the mastermind
behind the 5000 crore rupees scam.'

1584
01:51:33,143 --> 01:51:35,224
We're standing outside
the Bombay High Court

1585
01:51:35,304 --> 01:51:37,503
the accused
of the country's biggest scam

1586
01:51:37,583 --> 01:51:39,089
stock market's big bull

1587
01:51:39,169 --> 01:51:40,518
Hemant Shah has been sentenced
to 14-days Police custody.

1588
01:51:40,598 --> 01:51:43,505
'The premiere investigatory
agency has determined'

1589
01:51:43,585 --> 01:51:47,013
'that Mr. Shah is responsible
for a 5000 crore rupees scam.'

1590
01:51:47,093 --> 01:51:50,422
Where is all this goverment's
money which you have misused?

1591
01:51:50,502 --> 01:51:52,382
You don't have any option, Mr. Hemant.

1592
01:51:52,462 --> 01:51:54,987
Please, tell us the truth.
Tell us, everything.

1593
01:51:55,545 --> 01:51:58,144
'Who else is involved
in this scam except you?'

1594
01:51:58,224 --> 01:51:59,327
'Staying silent won't help.'

1595
01:51:59,407 --> 01:52:00,912
'What connection do you have
with Mr. Venkateshwar?'

1596
01:52:00,992 --> 01:52:02,665
'What deal happened
between you two?'

1597
01:52:02,745 --> 01:52:06,495
This case has shaken
the country's entire banking system.

1598
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:36,097
'Many bankers have been arrested.'

1599
01:52:36,177 --> 01:52:37,440
'And they have all been
sent like Hemant Shah...'

1600
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,701
'111 days...'

1601
01:52:38,781 --> 01:52:41,183
'He's bail has been approved.'

1602
01:52:42,542 --> 01:52:45,156
'He's been given bail,
but the case isn't over yet.'

1603
01:52:45,554 --> 01:52:47,132
'The investigation
is still being conducted.'

1604
01:53:06,926 --> 01:53:09,174
You just got home.
Where are you going now?

1605
01:53:09,525 --> 01:53:10,872
Take some rest.

1606
01:53:13,729 --> 01:53:16,241
I've rested enough for 111 days.

1607
01:53:17,295 --> 01:53:19,127
If I don't take any definitive step

1608
01:53:19,624 --> 01:53:21,163
then these people will bury me alive.

1609
01:53:26,136 --> 01:53:30,242
The worst is behind us. I promise you.

1610
01:53:31,276 --> 01:53:32,236
Hemant!

1611
01:53:33,411 --> 01:53:36,348
This confidence is
what attracted me to you.

1612
01:53:37,749 --> 01:53:40,520
But you must stop now, slow down

1613
01:53:40,868 --> 01:53:42,348
admit your mistake.

1614
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:45,915
And together
we'll deal with the consequences.

1615
01:53:45,995 --> 01:53:47,805
Why should I admit anything
when I made no mistake?

1616
01:53:49,776 --> 01:53:52,053
80% of our banking system is illegal.

1617
01:53:53,818 --> 01:53:55,598
They are just making me a scapegoat.

1618
01:53:59,941 --> 01:54:01,458
Brother is here.

1619
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,124
Welcome. Welcome back, Hemant.

1620
01:54:05,223 --> 01:54:07,780
Don't worry,
complete strategy is set for the next.

1621
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:10,574
- Viren.
- Yes, brother.

1622
01:54:11,395 --> 01:54:13,456
Take all the case papers back from him.

1623
01:54:13,837 --> 01:54:14,670
What?

1624
01:54:15,308 --> 01:54:16,282
What did you say?

1625
01:54:17,245 --> 01:54:19,891
I'll stay only a week in jail?

1626
01:54:21,232 --> 01:54:22,123
Come.

1627
01:54:28,922 --> 01:54:32,938
Hari's gone in hiding.
There's no clue of him.

1628
01:54:33,965 --> 01:54:35,545
Even his wife and kids are missing.

1629
01:54:38,368 --> 01:54:41,466
I've learned through a source that
the FM Minister is ready to make a deal.

1630
01:54:47,876 --> 01:54:52,231
After keeping me in jail for 111 days,
I know how their deal's going to be.

1631
01:54:56,703 --> 01:54:59,470
They thought that Hemant Shah is broken.

1632
01:54:59,550 --> 01:55:01,362
Now he can easily bow.

1633
01:55:03,293 --> 01:55:05,649
We still have our ace of cards to throw.

1634
01:55:06,966 --> 01:55:10,207
Using my name to make money
is acceptable to them.

1635
01:55:12,850 --> 01:55:15,877
But not the bad reputation
that comes with it.

1636
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,796
This time the deal will be equal.

1637
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,222
Equal?

1638
01:55:23,373 --> 01:55:24,869
But, where are we going?

1639
01:55:27,678 --> 01:55:29,697
Remember what I said to you.

1640
01:55:30,956 --> 01:55:33,353
If you want to take a risk,
then take a big one.

1641
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,156
If this is the biggest scam till date

1642
01:55:41,121 --> 01:55:43,511
then we need the biggest lawyer too.

1643
01:55:43,931 --> 01:55:45,853
Ashok Mirchandani.

1644
01:55:55,196 --> 01:55:57,280
Mr. Hemant, you made one mistake.

1645
01:55:59,193 --> 01:56:00,907
Anything is possible in this country.

1646
01:56:01,855 --> 01:56:03,602
Use fake promotors.

1647
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:05,888
Bribe the Police.

1648
01:56:06,305 --> 01:56:09,591
Threaten the Media,
corrupt the Judges. Anything.

1649
01:56:10,292 --> 01:56:11,695
Just one golden rule.

1650
01:56:13,114 --> 01:56:14,521
Never get caught.

1651
01:56:16,926 --> 01:56:18,295
And you, Mr. Hemant got caught.

1652
01:56:21,324 --> 01:56:24,462
Now your best option, in this case,
is what Viren is suggesting.

1653
01:56:25,214 --> 01:56:26,672
Make a deal with the government.

1654
01:56:28,088 --> 01:56:30,100
I will make sure that the
CBI drops most of the charges.

1655
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:32,581
You'll get a little jail time.

1656
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,965
- Viren.
- Yes, brother.

1657
01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:47,780
Call that Nair up.

1658
01:56:48,877 --> 01:56:51,066
Tell him,
we're giving back this case to him.

1659
01:56:52,708 --> 01:56:57,114
I think we made a mistake coming
to Ashok Mirchandani and Associates.

1660
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:02,665
I thought I had
the biggest ego in this room.

1661
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:10,481
Mr. Ashok, you should know

1662
01:57:11,709 --> 01:57:13,586
that I made a record while in jail.

1663
01:57:16,717 --> 01:57:18,074
Within 111 days

1664
01:57:18,595 --> 01:57:20,964
70 different people inquired me.

1665
01:57:22,236 --> 01:57:23,246
Seventy...

1666
01:57:24,793 --> 01:57:26,007
But they found nothing.

1667
01:57:30,539 --> 01:57:34,767
You made your name by
defending people like Mastaan.

1668
01:57:35,968 --> 01:57:37,097
I didn't commit any murder

1669
01:57:37,177 --> 01:57:40,820
but these people want
to make me the scapegoat

1670
01:57:41,585 --> 01:57:43,715
in this 5000 crore scam.

1671
01:57:46,214 --> 01:57:48,385
Whoever bails me out of this case

1672
01:57:49,605 --> 01:57:52,408
will go down in the history of Law.

1673
01:57:59,974 --> 01:58:02,608
I heard there's a similarity
between you and me.

1674
01:58:04,527 --> 01:58:05,907
Whenever we drink

1675
01:58:06,863 --> 01:58:09,216
we drink only the best. Or we don't.

1676
01:58:16,843 --> 01:58:21,039
So logically seeing... we only took
advantage of the system's loopholes.

1677
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:24,102
I have all this information.

1678
01:58:25,745 --> 01:58:28,734
There's one thing which
is confusing me and the CBI.

1679
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:35,533
On 2nd November 1992,
you withdrew 52 lakh rupees.

1680
01:58:36,685 --> 01:58:38,228
52 lakh rupees.

1681
01:58:38,858 --> 01:58:41,929
Why did you need so much money suddenly?

1682
01:58:47,161 --> 01:58:51,806
Look Hemant, if you really
want me to go down in history

1683
01:58:52,436 --> 01:58:56,049
then there can be no secrets
between you and me.

1684
01:59:02,849 --> 01:59:04,631
- Viren.
- Yes, brother.

1685
01:59:06,277 --> 01:59:09,286
Remember I told you
I've an ace up my sleeve.

1686
01:59:09,701 --> 01:59:11,629
- Yes.
- Wait a second.

1687
01:59:12,342 --> 01:59:14,094
Ace...

1688
01:59:35,232 --> 01:59:36,943
Are you camera friendly?

1689
01:59:39,306 --> 01:59:41,070
What you just told me

1690
01:59:42,348 --> 01:59:46,231
should be recorded on camera
and played on the television.

1691
01:59:46,976 --> 01:59:50,386
There won't be anything
more sensational than this.

1692
01:59:53,062 --> 01:59:55,112
I've a better idea.

1693
01:59:58,506 --> 02:00:01,553
Call reporters and journalists
from every corner of the world.

1694
02:00:02,397 --> 02:00:06,311
BBC, CNN, Times, News Week.

1695
02:00:07,249 --> 02:00:10,143
Let's do a press conference at the Taj.

1696
02:00:11,153 --> 02:00:12,068
Live.

1697
02:00:31,863 --> 02:00:34,120
We must shut Hemant up at any cost.

1698
02:00:34,897 --> 02:00:37,222
Otherwise,
our jobs, life, will be all over.

1699
02:00:37,896 --> 02:00:39,392
These are the Exact words from the top.

1700
02:00:41,178 --> 02:00:42,381
We've only one option then.

1701
02:00:43,106 --> 02:00:44,602
Let's make a settlement
with Mirchandani.

1702
02:00:45,146 --> 02:00:46,639
Because Hemant will never agree.

1703
02:00:47,057 --> 02:00:48,359
Good idea, let's go.

1704
02:01:10,879 --> 02:01:12,180
Mr. Mirchandani.

1705
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,182
Dheeraj, CBI.

1706
02:01:14,934 --> 02:01:16,294
Don't waste my time.

1707
02:01:16,745 --> 02:01:18,215
I can't help you.

1708
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:22,883
Really? What is this?

1709
02:01:22,963 --> 02:01:26,138
Is this a school?
Am I some kid who'll be scared of you?

1710
02:01:28,467 --> 02:01:29,798
Listen, Mr. Mirchandani.

1711
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:33,220
No one's trying to scare you,
Mr. Mirchandani.

1712
02:01:34,052 --> 02:01:35,472
We just came here with a request.

1713
02:01:36,088 --> 02:01:38,622
Tell Hemant to stop this charade
while there's still time.

1714
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:42,767
A compromise is still possible.
Even the Kohlis want this.

1715
02:01:43,668 --> 02:01:45,954
Then tell them to give
a direct offer Hemant.

1716
02:01:46,435 --> 02:01:47,778
He takes his own decision.

1717
02:01:48,046 --> 02:01:49,219
Bravo, Mr. Ashok.

1718
02:01:49,788 --> 02:01:51,283
Spoken like a politician.

1719
02:01:51,598 --> 02:01:53,325
- Excuse me.
- Yes, we know.

1720
02:01:53,405 --> 02:01:56,256
We know you're going to join
the opposition in a few months.

1721
02:01:56,771 --> 02:02:01,106
And this charade is
just an entry fee for them.

1722
02:02:01,463 --> 02:02:02,326
Am I right?

1723
02:02:02,755 --> 02:02:04,345
They only wanted you to bow.

1724
02:02:04,625 --> 02:02:07,056
But you're prepared
to prostrate before them.

1725
02:02:11,141 --> 02:02:12,300
Excuse me.

1726
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:19,400
Ashok Mirchandani doesn't bow
or prostrate in front of anyone.

1727
02:02:21,587 --> 02:02:23,994
But you did the right thing
by giving me the key.

1728
02:02:25,805 --> 02:02:30,145
Because now I'll take your boss
to the cleaners in the conference room.

1729
02:02:31,295 --> 02:02:32,563
Thank you for that.

1730
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:34,495
Please. Excuse me.

1731
02:02:44,398 --> 02:02:45,894
Sir, call for you.

1732
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:50,647
Took you soon enough, Mr. Sanjeev.

1733
02:02:51,564 --> 02:02:54,866
Hemant, what do you think you're doing?

1734
02:02:58,296 --> 02:02:59,571
Have you lost your mind?

1735
02:03:01,673 --> 02:03:03,298
You left me with no option.

1736
02:03:03,574 --> 02:03:05,567
I kept a lot of patience for 15-months.

1737
02:03:05,647 --> 02:03:09,082
Look Hemant,
you can't defeat these people.

1738
02:03:09,792 --> 02:03:15,648
If you go ahead with this,
then all the doors will close on you.

1739
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:17,658
You don't know these people.

1740
02:03:18,252 --> 02:03:20,216
They don't spare their kin, and you...

1741
02:03:21,142 --> 02:03:25,180
Just remember,
anything can happen at any time

1742
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:28,220
and you won't know what hit you.
Understood?

1743
02:03:28,709 --> 02:03:30,425
They were never open for me anyway.

1744
02:03:32,198 --> 02:03:33,775
Your biggest mistake...

1745
02:03:34,587 --> 02:03:37,949
You thought
that barking dogs seldom bite.

1746
02:03:39,139 --> 02:03:43,386
But Hemant Shah's bite
is worse than his bark.

1747
02:03:44,405 --> 02:03:46,450
Yeah, yeah, I get that.

1748
02:03:46,951 --> 02:03:49,379
Listen, it's not too late.

1749
02:03:49,834 --> 02:03:52,601
Their people are already there.
Give me some time.

1750
02:03:52,681 --> 02:03:54,441
I'll fix something, okay?

1751
02:03:58,110 --> 02:03:59,453
You have three minutes.

1752
02:04:16,042 --> 02:04:19,498
Mr. Hemant...

1753
02:04:19,578 --> 02:04:20,640
Sir, sir...

1754
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:21,793
Sir, one qestion...

1755
02:04:21,873 --> 02:04:24,553
Settle down. Settle down. Just a minute.

1756
02:04:24,633 --> 02:04:26,386
Listen. Everyone, listen.

1757
02:04:26,466 --> 02:04:29,288
Listen. Sit down, please.

1758
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:35,743
First, I'll read Hemant's detailed
admission and then give my statement.

1759
02:04:35,823 --> 02:04:38,619
And only after that
will you ask questions.

1760
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:40,025
Please settle down.

1761
02:05:24,768 --> 02:05:31,398
On November 1st 1991
Mr. Sanjeev Kohli called Mr. Hemant

1762
02:05:31,478 --> 02:05:35,962
and asked if he can arrange
for 1 crore rupees in two days.

1763
02:05:36,042 --> 02:05:37,939
His exact words were

1764
02:05:38,019 --> 02:05:41,197
"This is a lifetime investment
opportunity for you".

1765
02:05:41,907 --> 02:05:44,728
Mr. Hemant started
arranging for the money.

1766
02:05:44,808 --> 02:05:48,797
On 2nd November 1992,
he withdrew 30 lakh rupees

1767
02:05:48,877 --> 02:05:51,818
from the National Bank of India
in 100 and 50 denominations.

1768
02:05:52,332 --> 02:05:56,720
Then he withdrew ten lakh from
Forlay's Bank in 50s denominations.

1769
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,918
The proofs are these
withdrawal slips. Please.

1770
02:06:02,207 --> 02:06:03,091
Look here.

1771
02:06:03,834 --> 02:06:05,931
Then Mr. Hemant Shah's company president

1772
02:06:06,011 --> 02:06:09,130
Mr. Srikant arranged for 12 lakh rupees.

1773
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:12,415
And Mr. Hemant Shah
personally had 15 lakh.

1774
02:06:12,495 --> 02:06:14,480
Total 67 lakh rupees.

1775
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:18,177
Mr. Hemant Shah
informed Mr. Sanjeev Kohli

1776
02:06:18,257 --> 02:06:20,076
that's all he could arrange for.

1777
02:06:20,156 --> 02:06:23,035
Mr. Sanjeev said
that he'll give the rest

1778
02:06:23,115 --> 02:06:24,378
and you can return them later.

1779
02:06:24,458 --> 02:06:27,572
He called Mr. Hemant to Delhi
on 3rd November.

1780
02:06:27,903 --> 02:06:33,325
Mr. Hemant Shah and Mr. Srikant Kumar
put the money in two big bags

1781
02:06:33,405 --> 02:06:37,090
and reached Delhi in the evening
with an Indian Airlines flight

1782
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:39,827
and checked-in
the New Holiday Inn hotel.

1783
02:06:39,907 --> 02:06:41,480
Here's the proof. Please.

1784
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:42,609
There.

1785
02:06:46,927 --> 02:06:50,081
Next morning Mr. Sanjeev
sent a Contessa car.

1786
02:06:50,161 --> 02:06:54,412
Mr. Hemant and Mr. Srikant
got in the car with the suitcases.

1787
02:06:54,852 --> 02:06:57,625
But shifted
to Mr. Sanjeev's Honda Accord

1788
02:06:57,705 --> 02:07:00,552
before reaching the destination

1789
02:07:00,632 --> 02:07:04,531
and put Mr. Sanjeev's
33 lakh in their suitcases.

1790
02:07:05,115 --> 02:07:07,903
Now they had exactly 1crore rupees.

1791
02:07:09,003 --> 02:07:11,356
Then they headed for the destination.

1792
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:13,300
The destination was...

1793
02:07:14,463 --> 02:07:16,614
7 Race Course Road

1794
02:07:16,694 --> 02:07:20,825
and the investment opportunity
was The Prime Minister of India.

1795
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:28,149
That's right.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1796
02:07:28,805 --> 02:07:30,702
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Listen to me.

1797
02:07:30,782 --> 02:07:32,332
I said you all...

1798
02:07:32,412 --> 02:07:33,563
Normally...

1799
02:07:33,643 --> 02:07:36,209
Normally whenever there's a scam

1800
02:07:36,289 --> 02:07:39,161
we don't address
it by the person's name.

1801
02:07:40,099 --> 02:07:43,097
We call it the Cement Scam, Coal Scam,
that's how we call them.

1802
02:07:43,177 --> 02:07:46,869
If you want to give this scam a name,
then let me tell you

1803
02:07:46,949 --> 02:07:49,159
this is not the Hemant Shah scam.

1804
02:07:49,652 --> 02:07:51,897
It's the Prime Minister Scam.

1805
02:07:53,995 --> 02:07:56,022
- SIr...
- Tell me something...

1806
02:07:56,102 --> 02:07:59,473
Tell me, something...

1807
02:07:59,553 --> 02:08:03,404
He knew what Hemant was doing,
and yet he kept quiet.

1808
02:08:03,895 --> 02:08:05,939
He didn't do anything. Why?

1809
02:08:06,636 --> 02:08:08,124
What's the meaning of this?

1810
02:08:08,875 --> 02:08:10,226
It's all too clear.

1811
02:08:10,306 --> 02:08:14,912
He kept quiet because
even he is a part of this scam.

1812
02:08:14,992 --> 02:08:17,406
That is all. Thank you.

1813
02:08:17,902 --> 02:08:19,435
- But sir, such a huge allegation.
- Sir...

1814
02:08:19,515 --> 02:08:20,989
What is the source behind it?

1815
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:24,991
This is just an allegation, and I can
refute this allegation in a minute.

1816
02:08:25,071 --> 02:08:26,265
I see.

1817
02:08:27,488 --> 02:08:28,382
How?

1818
02:08:28,462 --> 02:08:33,157
Because Mr. Hemant, you said
that the money which was withdrawn

1819
02:08:33,237 --> 02:08:35,525
was mostly 50s and 100s denomination.

1820
02:08:35,605 --> 02:08:39,629
And how can you fit
1 crore rupees in two suitcases?

1821
02:08:39,709 --> 02:08:40,760
- Tell me.
- Tell me, sir.

1822
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,492
- Tell me, Mr. Hemant.
- Tell me, sir.

1823
02:08:42,572 --> 02:08:43,891
Tell me.

1824
02:08:45,229 --> 02:08:46,305
Tell me, sir.

1825
02:09:03,291 --> 02:09:04,593
Do you want to check?

1826
02:09:05,002 --> 02:09:06,846
Check if it's 1 crore or not.

1827
02:09:07,143 --> 02:09:09,017
I can count it for you if you want.

1828
02:09:12,223 --> 02:09:13,166
Do you see it now?

1829
02:09:14,561 --> 02:09:15,606
Are you happy?

1830
02:09:17,831 --> 02:09:18,947
Can I speak now?

1831
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:27,456
You say that I did
a scam of 5000 crores.

1832
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:30,322
First of all.

1833
02:09:32,669 --> 02:09:33,926
What scam?

1834
02:09:34,905 --> 02:09:36,419
Whose money did I take?

1835
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:41,370
Yours, your... or your money.

1836
02:09:48,649 --> 02:09:50,481
Do you even know what a scam is?

1837
02:09:53,814 --> 02:09:56,535
I gave a tip to a lift
man to buy shares of tyres.

1838
02:09:56,615 --> 02:09:58,270
Today he owns a car.

1839
02:09:59,819 --> 02:10:02,036
One day I bought peanuts at the signal.

1840
02:10:02,116 --> 02:10:04,042
Next day the rates of peanuts went up.

1841
02:10:04,383 --> 02:10:05,623
Is that a scam as well?

1842
02:10:10,237 --> 02:10:11,246
Yes.

1843
02:10:12,473 --> 02:10:15,227
I made a fortune in the stock market.

1844
02:10:16,557 --> 02:10:17,774
Did I do anything wrong?

1845
02:10:19,333 --> 02:10:20,724
Is it wrong to make money?

1846
02:10:25,309 --> 02:10:26,562
Not just you

1847
02:10:27,248 --> 02:10:30,775
but the entire country
made money because of me.

1848
02:10:32,634 --> 02:10:34,894
But you won't accept this fact today.

1849
02:10:35,435 --> 02:10:40,534
20-years-later you'll realise
what I did for you and the country.

1850
02:10:42,497 --> 02:10:44,098
I am not the problem, ma'am

1851
02:10:45,001 --> 02:10:47,168
the problem is our political system.

1852
02:10:48,305 --> 02:10:50,404
Our politicians do scams.

1853
02:10:52,045 --> 02:10:54,584
They don't want to see
anyone else getting rich.

1854
02:10:54,876 --> 02:10:57,259
Today they are forming
new laws to trap me

1855
02:10:57,339 --> 02:11:00,045
because they know
I haven't broken any law.

1856
02:11:03,585 --> 02:11:06,299
They are experts
in making false promises.

1857
02:11:08,732 --> 02:11:11,978
They are the ones who bury your dreams.

1858
02:11:13,626 --> 02:11:17,063
I taught middle-class India to dream.

1859
02:11:20,154 --> 02:11:24,648
I am a broker of those dreams
and not the stock market.

1860
02:11:31,389 --> 02:11:33,112
5000 crore, I'll tell you.

1861
02:11:34,227 --> 02:11:37,388
If I had it,
I would've given it all back.

1862
02:11:38,509 --> 02:11:39,571
Do you know why?

1863
02:11:41,048 --> 02:11:48,129
Because I am and will
always be the only Big Bull!

1864
02:11:50,201 --> 02:11:51,671
You can write whatever you like.

1865
02:11:51,973 --> 02:11:54,170
Hemant sir, please one more question.
Sir, please one more question.

1866
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:56,236
- Sir, one more question.
- Thank you for coming.

1867
02:11:56,316 --> 02:11:58,376
Sir, sir...

1868
02:11:58,456 --> 02:12:01,069
Sir, sir...

1869
02:12:17,258 --> 02:12:19,187
'The Prime Minister
is yet to comment...'

1870
02:12:19,267 --> 02:12:21,444
'Blame is on Prime Minister.'

1871
02:12:21,524 --> 02:12:23,537
'Bribe amount is Rs. 1 crore.'

1872
02:12:23,617 --> 02:12:25,206
'There has been
a huge drop in the market.'

1873
02:12:25,286 --> 02:12:26,685
'People suffered a huge loss.'

1874
02:12:26,765 --> 02:12:28,993
'The Prime Minister has denied
Hemant Shah's accusation.'

1875
02:12:29,073 --> 02:12:30,429
- Hemant Shah!
- Down. Down.

1876
02:12:30,509 --> 02:12:31,948
- Hemant Shah!
- Down. Down.

1877
02:12:32,028 --> 02:12:33,628
- Hemant Shah!
- Down. Down.

1878
02:12:33,708 --> 02:12:37,681
Until that doesn't happen,
the PM should resign.

1879
02:12:37,761 --> 02:12:40,471
Not at all. Hemant Shah is lying.

1880
02:12:41,949 --> 02:12:46,994
He just wants to escape going
to jail for 5000 crore scam that he did.

1881
02:12:47,241 --> 02:12:48,108
Wait a second.

1882
02:13:10,746 --> 02:13:13,220
You can never prove your case to JPC.

1883
02:13:15,144 --> 02:13:18,085
They are miles ahead, and...

1884
02:13:18,165 --> 02:13:19,847
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1885
02:13:19,927 --> 02:13:21,976
Is this why
you called me here at this hour?

1886
02:13:23,898 --> 02:13:25,390
What you saw the other day
was just part of the evidence.

1887
02:13:25,470 --> 02:13:26,946
We have much more.

1888
02:13:27,026 --> 02:13:28,509
You're not listening, Viren.

1889
02:13:29,296 --> 02:13:31,971
Your claims don't match
with the Police records.

1890
02:13:32,467 --> 02:13:34,134
According to the PM's itinerary

1891
02:13:34,214 --> 02:13:37,141
he wasn't at his residence
on that day and time.

1892
02:13:38,589 --> 02:13:41,659
There is no record in the visitor's
logbook of your brother's visit.

1893
02:13:43,406 --> 02:13:45,138
Your plane tickets, hotel stay

1894
02:13:45,218 --> 02:13:47,233
the entire money trail
will be proven bogus.

1895
02:13:47,598 --> 02:13:50,258
You know, what all this will mean.

1896
02:13:51,549 --> 02:13:55,180
It means that it's your word
against the Prime Minister.

1897
02:13:55,912 --> 02:13:57,315
And who will the people believe?

1898
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,201
The Prime Minister or two scamsters?

1899
02:14:02,327 --> 02:14:05,307
I told you before the press conference,
don't do it.

1900
02:14:05,643 --> 02:14:08,856
But no.
Your brother had to satisfy his ego.

1901
02:14:09,898 --> 02:14:12,375
But now you must
convince him to step back.

1902
02:14:13,174 --> 02:14:15,219
I don't know how you can do it, but...

1903
02:14:19,139 --> 02:14:20,414
Convince him.

1904
02:14:21,064 --> 02:14:23,687
Convince him to step back. Me?

1905
02:14:26,083 --> 02:14:27,843
And who is responsible for all of this?

1906
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,670
Hemant Shah
is the richest man in the country.

1907
02:14:31,162 --> 02:14:32,056
The highest taxpayer.

1908
02:14:32,136 --> 02:14:34,464
They will arrest you
under the narcotic's case, Viren.

1909
02:14:35,841 --> 02:14:36,696
What?

1910
02:14:36,776 --> 02:14:38,998
When or how don't even ask.

1911
02:14:39,518 --> 02:14:40,763
But they will do it.

1912
02:14:42,939 --> 02:14:45,758
Trust me, my sources are never wrong.
And you know it.

1913
02:14:46,584 --> 02:14:48,832
But we've no connection with narcotics.

1914
02:14:49,114 --> 02:14:50,499
What are you saying, Meera?

1915
02:14:50,579 --> 02:14:53,982
You should know how powerful
people in our country

1916
02:14:54,062 --> 02:14:57,932
manipulate the system
for their own advantage.

1917
02:14:59,133 --> 02:15:00,377
You're out on bail now.

1918
02:15:00,932 --> 02:15:03,040
But there's no bail
in the narcotic's case.

1919
02:15:04,974 --> 02:15:10,049
If you keep up this charade, then
I guarantee you that you'll go to jail.

1920
02:15:11,450 --> 02:15:13,367
And for a long time.

1921
02:15:19,958 --> 02:15:22,963
By the way, our scores are not settled.

1922
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:44,126
- Is brother still awake?
- Yes, he's inside.

1923
02:15:51,711 --> 02:15:55,933
Listen,
JPC doesn't believe our evidence.

1924
02:15:56,256 --> 02:15:59,147
Forget JPC. They are going
to arrest us for narcotics.

1925
02:15:59,559 --> 02:16:00,720
Narcotics?

1926
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:02,002
The news is confirmed.

1927
02:16:02,847 --> 02:16:04,029
What are you saying?

1928
02:16:04,109 --> 02:16:07,067
I don't want to go to jail again,
for narcotics or the stock market.

1929
02:16:07,147 --> 02:16:09,383
Please handle this.
I won't go to jail again.

1930
02:16:09,463 --> 02:16:11,205
What's wrong?

1931
02:16:11,532 --> 02:16:14,069
You promised you'll handle everything.

1932
02:16:15,398 --> 02:16:17,765
I don't want to go to jail.
I don't want to go to jail.

1933
02:16:18,666 --> 02:16:23,069
I wanted a normal life
as we had in Kalbadevi.

1934
02:16:23,149 --> 02:16:26,230
We used to be small time brokers
and a small office. Do you remember?

1935
02:16:27,381 --> 02:16:28,962
We were so happy with little money.

1936
02:16:30,547 --> 02:16:33,285
I warned you to tread slowly,
tread slowly.

1937
02:16:33,365 --> 02:16:34,654
Don't fly too high, don't...

1938
02:16:34,734 --> 02:16:36,115
First,
you said you're doing itfor Priya.

1939
02:16:36,195 --> 02:16:37,298
Then you said you're
doing it for the company.

1940
02:16:37,378 --> 02:16:38,707
Then you said you're
doing it for the family.

1941
02:16:38,787 --> 02:16:40,267
Then you said you're
doing it for the country!

1942
02:16:40,713 --> 02:16:42,621
You were actually doing it for yourself!

1943
02:16:44,206 --> 02:16:46,131
Why didn't you listen to me?

1944
02:16:47,504 --> 02:16:48,863
I told you that Meera
let go off with a warning

1945
02:16:48,943 --> 02:16:50,274
but she wrote an entire article.

1946
02:16:58,076 --> 02:16:59,230
What did you say?

1947
02:17:02,151 --> 02:17:03,137
Meera, what?

1948
02:17:27,328 --> 02:17:28,235
You?

1949
02:17:31,068 --> 02:17:32,771
A small leak sinks a great ship.

1950
02:17:34,244 --> 02:17:35,693
But I don't want to sink the ship.

1951
02:17:39,126 --> 02:17:41,210
I want to curb his limits from growing.

1952
02:17:43,652 --> 02:17:45,501
I want to tell you the truth.

1953
02:17:47,494 --> 02:17:49,285
I sent that girl on the train.

1954
02:17:50,028 --> 02:17:53,482
But then I realised maybe Venkateshwar
won't tell you the entire truth.

1955
02:17:54,694 --> 02:17:56,038
That's why I am here.

1956
02:18:02,672 --> 02:18:04,368
No one can stop my brother.

1957
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:08,372
He's reached the country's treasury.

1958
02:18:09,390 --> 02:18:11,558
He wants to be a billionaire
as soon as he can.

1959
02:18:11,957 --> 02:18:13,439
And he can do anything for it.

1960
02:18:14,828 --> 02:18:16,515
Doesn't make a difference to anyone.

1961
02:18:17,245 --> 02:18:19,311
No one can see what he's doing.

1962
02:18:20,247 --> 02:18:23,808
Maybe no one wants to see because their
pockets are filled, except for you.

1963
02:18:29,957 --> 02:18:32,326
You're the only person
who is not on his payroll.

1964
02:18:36,411 --> 02:18:37,868
That's why I came to you.

1965
02:18:46,676 --> 02:18:49,329
I had no intention
of sending you to jail.

1966
02:18:51,212 --> 02:18:55,016
I only wanted to slow you down a little.

1967
02:18:56,332 --> 02:18:59,346
You were issuing cheques
worth 5-6 billion.

1968
02:19:00,669 --> 02:19:04,198
I thought
that you're not breaking any law.

1969
02:19:04,636 --> 02:19:08,508
Maybe you'll be fined,
or be suspended for a couple of months.

1970
02:19:10,196 --> 02:19:13,121
I didn't know it will come to this.

1971
02:19:16,168 --> 02:19:18,314
I ruined everything.

1972
02:19:37,514 --> 02:19:38,963
You'll be fine.

1973
02:19:42,665 --> 02:19:44,182
I'll fix everything.

1974
02:19:47,667 --> 02:19:49,339
I won't let anything happen to you.

1975
02:20:07,569 --> 02:20:08,956
You don't look surprised.

1976
02:20:11,452 --> 02:20:12,775
You don't look worried.

1977
02:20:15,494 --> 02:20:17,781
What's the point of
looking worried anymore?

1978
02:20:20,054 --> 02:20:26,744
Ms. Meera, you've done many
breaking stories on me and earned fame.

1979
02:20:27,693 --> 02:20:30,199
But we had a partnership, didn't we?

1980
02:20:31,037 --> 02:20:35,066
Your source was from my own family,
my own brother.

1981
02:20:37,366 --> 02:20:39,622
I settled that account with Viren.

1982
02:20:41,165 --> 02:20:44,495
I gave him information
in exchange for information.

1983
02:20:48,796 --> 02:20:50,334
Then those books are closed.

1984
02:20:51,818 --> 02:20:52,995
Let's open new ones.

1985
02:20:54,313 --> 02:20:55,198
Which ones?

1986
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,091
I want you to write my story.

1987
02:21:00,945 --> 02:21:03,562
But not small articles
like you did earlier.

1988
02:21:03,907 --> 02:21:06,097
This time I want you
to write an entire book.

1989
02:21:09,183 --> 02:21:10,866
Because Ms. Meera

1990
02:21:13,832 --> 02:21:17,950
nothing happens
because of one man alone.

1991
02:21:20,728 --> 02:21:22,269
Stories are born out of circumstances

1992
02:21:23,039 --> 02:21:24,501
and not character.

1993
02:21:29,870 --> 02:21:32,660
If we had better laws,
and a better system

1994
02:21:33,930 --> 02:21:35,894
then I would've
never taken advantage of it.

1995
02:21:37,049 --> 02:21:38,137
That's not true.

1996
02:21:38,507 --> 02:21:40,254
If given a chance again

1997
02:21:40,628 --> 02:21:43,442
you'll find new loopholes
and take advantage, Hemant.

1998
02:21:44,747 --> 02:21:45,665
No.

1999
02:21:46,890 --> 02:21:47,893
Not today.

2000
02:21:48,993 --> 02:21:51,433
Because India doesn't need it anymore.

2001
02:21:53,428 --> 02:21:58,492
If you take me back to 1988 again,
then definitely.

2002
02:21:59,261 --> 02:22:01,654
I'll do it all over again.

2003
02:22:03,954 --> 02:22:10,005
And why do you think I'll write
a book on a selfish man like you?

2004
02:22:11,166 --> 02:22:12,326
Selfish?

2005
02:22:17,838 --> 02:22:19,508
Ms. Meera,
let me tell you another story.

2006
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:27,436
One day I went to Apollo Bunder instead
of Worli Seaface for my morning walk.

2007
02:22:27,516 --> 02:22:28,515
Just like that.

2008
02:22:29,008 --> 02:22:30,449
Do you know what happened the next day?

2009
02:22:30,793 --> 02:22:33,416
The share prices of Apollo tyre went up.

2010
02:22:36,162 --> 02:22:39,253
I've made many such good mistakes,
Ms. Meera.

2011
02:22:41,978 --> 02:22:44,821
And the common man
made a little fortune.

2012
02:22:47,218 --> 02:22:49,170
Some other accidental tip.

2013
02:22:50,738 --> 02:22:53,129
So, I can invest my money as well.

2014
02:22:56,378 --> 02:22:57,742
No tips for free.

2015
02:22:58,769 --> 02:23:00,966
For that you need money.

2016
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:06,203
Write this book, Ms. Meera

2017
02:23:07,461 --> 02:23:08,838
it will be a best-seller.

2018
02:23:12,295 --> 02:23:14,080
That's Hemant's Shah's prediction.

2019
02:23:15,539 --> 02:23:17,371
And it's never wrong.

2020
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:27,642
'Hemant couldn't prove
his allegations to the JPC.'

2021
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:29,779
'PM gets a clean chit.'

2022
02:23:33,758 --> 02:23:37,422
'Hemant Shah has quit the stock market
and assured he'll never return.

2023
02:23:38,336 --> 02:23:40,755
'He's taken
full responsibility of the scam'

2024
02:23:40,835 --> 02:23:43,052
'and Viren Shah has been acquitted.'

2025
02:23:43,710 --> 02:23:47,563
'Around 27 cases are pending
against Hemant Shah.'

2026
02:24:26,862 --> 02:24:28,124
Five years.

2027
02:24:31,614 --> 02:24:34,973
1825 days without me.

2028
02:24:37,964 --> 02:24:39,092
You're going to have a ball.

2029
02:24:41,037 --> 02:24:42,553
Why do you feel that way?

2030
02:24:48,589 --> 02:24:51,617
My feelings don't count anymore.

2031
02:24:55,860 --> 02:25:00,944
I never felt that Viren
will make such a mistake.

2032
02:25:03,328 --> 02:25:04,973
And I never felt that...

2033
02:25:09,221 --> 02:25:11,930
Hari will betray me
and become an approver.

2034
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:24,798
I don't know what Viren
and Hari did was right or wrong.

2035
02:25:26,188 --> 02:25:32,602
I don't know what the government
did was right or wrong.

2036
02:25:35,510 --> 02:25:37,261
But I do know

2037
02:25:38,698 --> 02:25:44,614
that what you said to me
in Hanging Garden, you did it.

2038
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:51,286
Today there are many buildings in Mumbai

2039
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:54,332
have scaled heights because of you.

2040
02:25:59,382 --> 02:26:06,847
You gave new hope to the people,
to see a new world.

2041
02:26:09,482 --> 02:26:11,893
And they will never come out of it.

2042
02:26:18,445 --> 02:26:19,552
Forget about the people

2043
02:26:22,959 --> 02:26:24,823
you just wanted a husband
who owned an apartment, a car

2044
02:26:24,903 --> 02:26:30,249
and a stable job. And look at this now.

2045
02:26:30,767 --> 02:26:31,920
Hemant...

2046
02:26:34,671 --> 02:26:42,106
Most of the people in this world
have their destiny written.

2047
02:26:43,759 --> 02:26:46,846
But only few write their own destiny.

2048
02:26:48,907 --> 02:26:50,374
You're one of them.

2049
02:26:58,149 --> 02:27:02,252
You can fulfill those dreams
when you come back.

2050
02:27:17,977 --> 02:27:18,900
Let's go, sir.

2051
02:27:37,642 --> 02:27:41,552
Next day I heard that
he died of a heart attack.

2052
02:27:43,695 --> 02:27:45,425
Was it a conspiracy?

2053
02:27:46,402 --> 02:27:50,693
Was it political motivated conspiracy
by some people to hide something?

2054
02:27:52,428 --> 02:27:55,550
Was it the biggest cover-up
of this country?

2055
02:28:33,357 --> 02:28:35,716
Maybe yes, maybe not.

2056
02:28:37,842 --> 02:28:42,119
The truth is Hemant Shah's
life was a big controversy.

2057
02:28:44,533 --> 02:28:46,185
But 2020...

2058
02:28:47,222 --> 02:28:48,561
This world is very different.

2059
02:28:49,847 --> 02:28:53,360
Our country is in the hands
of professional MBAs like you.

2060
02:28:54,873 --> 02:28:57,547
And it's more for relief
if I'm being honest.

2061
02:29:06,819 --> 02:29:10,518
But before I go, I want to say
that it wasn't always like this.

2062
02:29:11,730 --> 02:29:14,975
30-years-ago, our country
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

2063
02:29:16,293 --> 02:29:21,970
And 25-years-ago Hemant Shah
reminded me of this in an auditorium.

2064
02:29:23,836 --> 02:29:26,600
I know you believe
he's a scamster. But...

2065
02:29:27,416 --> 02:29:28,933
He wasn't a scamster on that day.

2066
02:29:30,225 --> 02:29:31,369
He was the hero for the people.

2067
02:29:32,626 --> 02:29:36,196
For the people sitting there,
and those waiting outside for him.

2068
02:29:36,532 --> 02:29:37,710
Excuse me, ma'am.

2069
02:29:39,035 --> 02:29:40,119
What about you?

2070
02:29:40,408 --> 02:29:41,964
Was he a hero for you too?

2071
02:29:45,062 --> 02:29:48,742
Even 5-years after independence,
development was nil.

2072
02:29:49,249 --> 02:29:50,543
That was a crime.

2073
02:29:52,121 --> 02:29:54,568
What Hemant Shah did was also a crime.

2074
02:29:55,708 --> 02:30:00,670
And as strange as it may sound,
maybe we needed a crime like this.

2075
02:30:00,750 --> 02:30:02,537
To emerge from that crime.

2076
02:30:03,328 --> 02:30:05,791
And Hemant was the perfect candidate.

2077
02:30:07,641 --> 02:30:09,628
If he was a little less egoistic

2078
02:30:10,154 --> 02:30:11,858
if he knew how to tread slow

2079
02:30:12,943 --> 02:30:14,582
then he could've survived
for a longer time.

2080
02:30:15,926 --> 02:30:17,210
But he was a dreamer.

2081
02:30:17,290 --> 02:30:21,977
So it's important to tell his story,
which I did today.

2082
02:30:23,056 --> 02:30:25,199
The face which lit up on the screen

2083
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:28,511
whether it belongs
to a hero or a villain

2084
02:30:29,051 --> 02:30:32,642
you can make your assumptions
by reading my book.

2085
02:30:34,942 --> 02:30:36,813
But there are no two opinions
about one thing...

2086
02:30:38,279 --> 02:30:43,361
He was and always will be...
the only Big Bull.

2087
02:31:12,887 --> 02:31:22,984
"My beloved's like a prayer of hope,
maybe that's how God is..."

2088
02:31:23,395 --> 02:31:33,980
"You're like drops of water,
giving me fresh breath of air..."

2089
02:31:34,871 --> 02:31:44,423
"My beloved's like a prayer of hope,
maybe that's how God is..."

2090
02:31:45,229 --> 02:31:55,596
"You're like drops of water,
giving me fresh breath of air..."

2091
02:31:57,832 --> 02:32:08,808
"On the verge of love my heart believes,
this is a relation of generations..."

2092
02:32:09,367 --> 02:32:14,839
"In a city of turmoil..."

2093
02:32:14,919 --> 02:32:20,285
"You're the one I believe in..."

2094
02:32:20,365 --> 02:32:25,666
"With you life feels worth living..."

2095
02:32:25,746 --> 02:32:31,189
"Without you there's no living..."

2096
02:32:31,269 --> 02:32:36,344
"Without you there's no living..."

2097
02:32:59,222 --> 02:33:09,030
"My beloved's like a prayer of hope,
maybe that's how God is..."

2098
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:20,356
"You're like drops of water,
giving me fresh breath of air..."
