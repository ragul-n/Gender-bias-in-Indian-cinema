1
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,593
What are you doing?
Why do you stare at women?

2
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,631
If some day there's a fight,
both of us will get thrashed!

3
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,705
Sameeran had asked me to meet
her here. I'm looking for her.

4
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,710
-Excuse me...
-Is this a joke?

5
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,524
Where are you going?
Return the wallet!

6
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,257
Son, why did you beat him?

7
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,728
For this. It's yours.

8
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,604
Good grief! My money!

9
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:30,406
May he be ruined! This is what he
did under the pretext of begging!

10
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,475
Give him two more blows
on my behalf.

11
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,311
Spare him. He's a poor man.

12
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,955
Thank you.

13
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,763
-Where are you?
-Goodness gracious.

14
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,777
May Lucknow always prosper.

15
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,041
You do always find a good face.

16
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,375
-Pardon me?
-Did you see?

17
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,779
See what? The one who
promised didn't turn up.

18
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,779
Forget her. Look at this one.

19
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,053
I swear she's beautiful!

20
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,353
Look there, that's the one!

21
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,262
She's removing the veil!

22
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,202
Like the moon in the clouds.

23
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,806
Mother, you keep these.

24
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,813
-So Cupid's arrow has found you.
-Who is she?

25
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,153
I'm not a detective to know
everyone in this big city.

26
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,550
We must find out.

27
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:50,228
Let's follow her. We'll find out
her family's address too. Come on.

28
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,823
Stop.

29
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,657
Did you nab a pickpocket?

30
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,335
-Yes.
-And let him go?

31
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,161
He's been caught.
Come and identify him.

32
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,997
We don't want to get involved.

33
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:05,004
-That's your job. Come on.
-No, sir. You can't leave.

34
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,710
Let us go. Our family
has already left.

35
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,644
Let them go. Come along or you
too will be locked up.

36
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,976
This is great.

37
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,685
-He won't give up.
-How about her...

38
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,655
Let her go home
or we'll land in prison.

39
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,394
The night of Friday night.
It's my responsibility.

40
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,733
-Good day sir.
-What a nuisance!

41
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,494
-What are you doing?
-It's me!

42
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,876
Sameeran? What are you doing here?
I was looking for you at the fair.

43
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:42,046
I came to meet you but
this rascal pinched my wallet.

44
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,408
You go on home.
I'll sort him out.

45
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,078
Let me see...
So it's you!

46
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,486
He's after the ladies today.

47
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,895
Write the report. He's
the same pickpocket...

48
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,900
-Your name?
-Mizra Masaraddik Sheiza.

49
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,893
And your father?

50
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,898
-So you're the inspector's son?
-Yes.

51
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:37,125
Okay, that's all right.
Keep my shoes there too.

52
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,940
I'll hit no less than 250 times.
Not one less!

53
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,342
Let the young man come.

54
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,239
-Keep your shoes too.
-Very well.

55
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,815
-Father, keep my shoes here too.
-Sure keep them.

56
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,690
These are enough to crown him.

57
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:14,466
Mother, today brother
will be crowned with my shoes!

58
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,969
Shut up!

59
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,807
-Young man...
-What's the matter?

60
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,986
-Don't go in.
-Why? Do we have women guests?

61
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,718
No, arrangements have
been made to crown you.

62
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,789
But why today'?

63
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,552
News came from the police
station at the fair

64
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:44,999
that you stare at women in veil.
And try to glimpse their faces.

65
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,737
-So...?
-So your father is furious.

66
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,335
He has collected the shoes
of the entire neighbourhood.

67
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,533
It begins!

68
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:59,680
Don't you dare run away!
Ramzani! Bring the rascal in!

69
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,387
Go in. For God's sake!

70
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,591
Good God, rid me of this pain.

71
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,185
But this pain won't go away.

72
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,900
Brother, Good day.

73
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,539
-Quiet!
-Come here!

74
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,436
She's an enemy of her brother!

75
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,779
Do you see these?

76
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:38,253
Father, I only see darkness
from here right to there.

77
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,789
You'll be showered with so many
shoes that you'll come to senses!

78
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,061
-I will lose my life.
-That would be even better!

79
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,788
It's better to be childless
than to have kids like you!

80
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,968
From where should I begin?
This part or that?

81
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:59,239
Father, if you must crown me,
then begin from here.

82
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,867
Here?

83
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:08,086
-Think of the shoes, if not my head.
-That's what I will do.

84
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,883
It's a hand!
And I thought it was the shoe!

85
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,583
You've driven my son bald
beating him with shoes.

86
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,830
Mother, see this...

87
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:24,431
Mother, have the crowning ceremony
delayed for another day.

88
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,726
So I make a mistake again.

89
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:31,000
Let him go.
He won't do it again.

90
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:32,941
There you are! You're spoiling him!

91
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:39,106
Father, I promise, I will never step
anywhere near the Dargah Sharif again.

92
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,117
This chap is such a nuisance!
He has made a joke out of me!

93
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,922
He has given you his word,
hasn't he?

94
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,128
And I ask you
to forgive him.

95
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,329
-May I leave, father?
-Scram!

96
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,666
Mother, may I come in?

97
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,426
Son? Come in.

98
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:38,165
See what I've got for you.
Something from the holy shrine.

99
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,512
May you have a long life.
You care so much for me.

100
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,183
Mother, I also prayed for you...

101
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:51,515
that you would get the opportunity
to go on the holy Haj pilgrimage.

102
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,785
Amen.

103
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:59,026
That will happen, but why didn't
you ask for a bride for yourself?

104
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,598
-That would have been refused.
-Brother...

105
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,199
Do me too a favour.

106
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:11,006
This is the list of guests.
My birthday is on the day after tomorrow.

107
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,942
This is my daughter's first birthday
since she to got married.

108
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:21,050
We'll have a grand celebration.
Let's see the people she has invited.

109
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:32,555
You've invited everyone but
I don't see Aslam and Shaida.

110
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,224
Why?

111
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,396
Here, right at the end.

112
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,233
Not at the end. Their names
should be right on top.

113
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,567
He's my son's childhood friend.

114
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,642
For me, they are like you.

115
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,242
In fact call Shaida's parents too.

116
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,109
-That leaves Aslam...
-My dearest friend.

117
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,588
I also like him because
he has nobody in the world.

118
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:05,392
-He has neither mother nor father.
-Don't say that. I'm his mother.

119
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,062
Your late father used to say...

120
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,702
"he who has found a good friend,
has found everything"

121
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,706
God bless the three of you
and your friendship.

122
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,744
Have the invitations printed
and distribute them.

123
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,335
Naseeban...

124
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,905
Where has everyone gone today?
There's not a soul around.

125
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,049
There's enough food.
Don't grab or fight.

126
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,845
Children, eat as you wish.

127
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,023
Go for it!

128
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,203
Let's eat in that room.
Nobody will come there.

129
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,221
Nice place. Let's sit here.

130
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,435
Such a soft mattress.
Join me.

131
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,973
Great fun sitting here.

132
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,438
-Whose picture is that?
-That's Rehana's brother.

133
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,619
-Why?
-I think I've seen him.

134
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,948
-In your dreams.
-Him and in my dreams?

135
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,285
He probably thinks
no end of himself.

136
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,796
He has hung a huge portrait
of himself in this little room.

137
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:29,465
The picture is not all that bad.

138
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,367
Maybe not for you.
Come here, I'll show you.

139
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,077
First, look at his forehead.

140
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,879
Like an old unrepaired
road of the municipality.

141
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,213
And the nose is like a roasted
egg-plant on a slice of burnt bread.

142
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,981
And the mouth is a letter box.

143
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,229
-In which you drop letters.
-Don't say that.

144
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,089
If Rehana hears us,
what will she say?

145
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,991
We're eating her food and
insulting her brother.

146
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:11,331
I say if this chap appears
and gets angry, I'd...

147
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,410
-hit him hard...
-Goodness me!

148
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,974
What have you done?

149
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,511
Wait! Wait!

150
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,788
This is terrible!

151
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,702
Don't tell Rehana.
You'll get a bad name.

152
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,395
-If he tells Rehana?
-No way, silly girl.

153
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,702
Man goes crazy when he gets
a thrashing from a woman.

154
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,705
-Understand?
-Yes.

Brother!

192
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,330
You! I was looking for you.

193
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,427
I got you a beautiful necklace
for your birthday.

194
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,067
Yes.

195
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,964
-This is very bad.
-What?

196
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,139
I'd lose face if someone
had spotted you.

197
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:53,740
And I'd be maligned.
No friend will come here.

198
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,740
I'll go and tell mother.

199
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,745
-Don't tell her.
-Then don't come here.

200
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,781
All right. Go about your work.

201
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,000
-Naseeban...
-What?

202
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,500
-Will you do me a favour?
-Lots of favours.

203
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,494
There's a girl there...

204
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,530
Plenty of girls there.

205
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,607
-No, the one with the eyes...
-All of them have eyes.

206
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,467
-Will you let me speak?
-Okay.

207
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,307
I'll give you a broad description.
The girl with the satin scarf.

208
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,413
With the flowers? Oh yes.

209
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:39,180
-Here's a piece of it.
-Where did you get this?

210
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,358
I'll tell you later.
Find out about her.

211
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:48,193
-Don't you squeal.
-No, sir. I wouldn't dare!

212
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:52,631
-But...
-You'll get it. Do the job.

213
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,769
Why are you standing here?
Look at them having fun.

214
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,977
Everybody is exchanging scarves.

215
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,548
Give it to me.

216
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:12,685
-Let us exchange ours.
-But mine is torn.

217
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,653
-What will you do with it?
-Doesn't matter.

218
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,851
-What is it?
-Nothing, lady!

219
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,426
Where have you trapped me!

220
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:31,057
-Congratulations, Bano!
-What for?

221
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,827
I won't tell you...
but you must take the hint!

222
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,071
She's crazy!

223
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:47,213
-What news have you brought?
-They're from our very own locality.

224
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,249
She's the daughter of that
gentleman from Agra.

225
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,252
-Are you sure?
-Of course...

226
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,426
I used to work for them
before I came here.

227
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,928
They're a nice family.
He has seven sons...

228
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,101
-this is the only daughter.
-Do you know the girl well?

229
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:09,429
But of course! I don't find
time from my chores...

230
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,369
or I used to visit their
house every day.

231
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,373
Really? That's great!

232
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,337
Here's your reward. I'll tell you what
I want to tell her in a couple of days.

233
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:20,513
-Understand?
-Absolutely, sir!

234
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:24,677
Give that piece back to me.
My heart will be at rest.

235
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:29,389
-Such is your pining?
-Are you in there?

236
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,122
You may leave.

237
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,330
Come in.

238
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,365
-Have you come alone?
-No, sir. He's got me along too.

239
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,405
-Salutations!
-Aslam! Where had you vanished?

240
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,904
I was quite busy but
I had to make it today.

241
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,811
It's Rehana's birthday and
on hearing your news from Shaida...

242
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,949
I had to drop everything and
come to congratulate you.

243
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:59,384
You stone hearted brute...
you have finally melted!

244
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,989
-When are you saying it with sweets?
-Right now.

245
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,424
I mean, at least not
till next Thursday.

246
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,154
That won't be necessary. She's...

247
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,961
Rehana has sent this and
has wished both of you.

248
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:19,835
I understand. In answer,
give her this.

249
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,701
And this is from me.

250
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,717
-Now tell us.
-She has come for the party.

251
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,188
I was asking Naseeban
when you guys landed up.

252
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,653
I've found out that she's
the daughter of Agha Nanhe.

253
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,026
Take a look at what
I've got from her.

254
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,762
You're terrific! But where
did you get this piece?

255
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,970
Don't even ask!

256
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,639
Cupid's arrow again?

257
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,073
Even on the back.

258
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,642
What?

259
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:04,779
What a lashing!
She must have given it hard.

260
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,716
-What are you doing?
-You're a third class lover.

261
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,825
Scared of a whip lash!
And look at me.

262
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,620
I only haven't experienced
a cannonball.

263
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,236
-I've been hit by everything else.
-I'd have died of shame!

264
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,406
-Actually...
-Forget it.

265
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,575
Now that we know the girl,
let's fix the marriage fast.

266
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:32,237
Give it a good thought.
They might turn down the proposal.

267
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:37,477
What rot! Nobody in the whole Lucknow
can turn down Aslam.

268
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:42,624
-Shall we go tomorrow?
-Yes. Each minute is painful.

269
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,261
There goes another bachelor.

270
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:47,823
As for you...
God take care.

271
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,260
I am leaving.

272
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:55,871
-Where are you taking this?
-The wound reminds me...

273
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:05,276
burn this scarf, mix it in
butter and apply it on the wound.

274
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,282
What about his education?

275
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,518
-He has done his Masters in Arts.
-Very good.

276
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,131
-How about his health...?
-Pardon me...

277
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,097
-I mean, does he play games?
-Games?

278
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:30,296
-Of course! He plays it very well.
-What game is that?

279
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:37,637
He's got to carry 2 men on
his back and run for 2 miles.

280
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,875
Very good. Funny are
these games and their names.

281
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:46,317
Now tell me if they have
some land or property...

282
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,081
You don't have to ask.

283
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,765
They have 2O homes
and 7 shops here.

284
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:01,165
They have 200 orchards of
mangoes and guavas in Malihabad.

285
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,503
Very good! Assume the
proposal almost accepted.

286
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:11,339
But let me ask my Dad.
His decision is the final one.

287
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,211
-Your Dad?
-Yes, he has gone to see his Dad.

288
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,714
Meaning your Dad has gone
to his Dad's house?

289
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,858
-That's right.
-Very good!

290
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,758
-Shall we return next week?
-Yes, that's perfect.

291
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,701
Sounds as if the whole family
is living on nectar. Let's go.

292
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,372
Show me your pulse.

293
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,392
-Please, step this way.
-Right away.

294
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,073
I don't know the importance
of pilgrimage in your religion.

295
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,639
But I wouldn't advise her
to go on Haj.

296
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:25,411
The illness has made her very weak.
She needs rest.

297
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,282
Please have her pilgrimage postponed.

298
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:32,424
Somebody else could
be sent in her place.

299
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:37,162
Haj can be postponed in sickness
or unavoidable circumstances.

300
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:43,930
If somebody else goes in her place,
they will reap the rewards.

301
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,443
In my opinion, this is right.

302
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,573
Sir, if you would agree to go...

303
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,443
I would be grateful.
As would my mother.

304
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,448
-I don't mind but...
-What is it?

305
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,558
I'd like to talk to your mother.

306
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:08,129
Please go in. Announce your arrival.
I'll show the doctor out.

307
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,458
Come along, doctor.

308
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,679
-How are you feeling?
-Thank God, I'm well.

309
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:36,015
-What did the priest say?
-He was willing.

310
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:40,691
He wanted to go in my place
but he has a young daughter.

311
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,500
How can he go without
getting her married?

312
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,165
He was not clear but
he did express it.

313
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:54,507
-He'd like her to marry you.
-Marry me?

314
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:59,944
I too would like both
of my desires fulfilled together.

315
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,179
Your wedding and my Haj.

316
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,519
His daughter is simple,
beautiful and one in a million.

317
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,515
But mother, this is
contrary to your word.

318
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,360
You gave me the liberty to
marry anyone. So why this?

319
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,859
My son, that is how
the situation is.

320
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,737
Don't you want me
to do the pilgrimage?

321
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,940
If I was well, the doctor
wouldn't forbid me from going.

322
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,878
-One can't trust life.
-Don't say that.

323
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:40,146
What if I present someone
else instead of me?

324
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:42,552
I mean somebody better
than me in every respect.

325
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,288
My son, nobody is better than
her own child for a mother.

326
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:53,559
-Shall I call for the priest?
-No. Not yet.

327
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,231
Give me time to think.

328
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,168
Okay, but there's very little time.

329
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,576
We must give the priest
an answer by tomorrow.

330
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,314
All right.

331
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,380
Let go! Please, Father, I swear
I was going to say my prayers!

332
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,643
You and read prayers!
Where were you going?

333
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:21,488
I have just one aim.
My beloved.., where else?

334
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,187
-What are you doing here?
-I came to ask you something.

335
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,324
-Want to get married?
-With my beloved?

336
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,569
No, to the girl I wish.

337
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:39,798
You're foolish. The man who
fools his Dad for his girl

338
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,070
and fools the world. Why would
he marry the girl you choose?

339
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:47,342
-Think about it...
-All right.

340
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,944
Give it a thought.

341
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,700
Who could it be at this hour?

342
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:16,175
Great. Please come in.

343
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,886
I knew it. You would fall in love,
and I'd bear the brunt.

344
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,957
-It's something else.
-Really? Sit down.

345
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,998
You could've called me.
Why did you bother at midnight?

346
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,402
It's one and the same thing.
Does it matter that I came?

347
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,069
Or have I disturbed you?

348
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,570
You haven't slept.
What were you doing?

349
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,407
-Accounts.
-What of?

350
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,171
Of your obligations.

351
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:55,218
Today they are seen
in the form of respect and honour.

352
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,917
What do you mean? Won't you
let me sit? Shall I leave?

353
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,020
From this house?

354
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,427
Which your kindness
has helped build?

355
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:10,430
I had lost everything.
I just have life.

356
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,836
I wouldn't even have that
if you hadn't saved me.

357
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,107
I'm not worthy of anything else.
At least let me say it.

358
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,002
Are you through?

359
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,780
Now may I say why I came
here so late?

360
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,775
Yes, please do.

361
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:34,953
You know mother has
two desires in her old age.

362
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,788
One is getting me married.
The other is to do the Haj.

363
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,925
-Her trip had been organised.
-I know.

364
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,465
The problem is these days
she has become very weak.

365
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,798
The doctor says she mustn't
undertake the trip to Haj.

366
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,342
I see. So...?

367
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:01,474
It has been decided to send
someone else in her place.

368
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,815
We spoke to the priest
and he's even willing.

369
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,222
But the problem is,
he has a young daughter.

370
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,691
And he can't leave
till she's married.

371
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:18,093
Her wedding can't be
arranged anywhere so fast.

372
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:23,338
-So mother wants me to marry her.
-You?

373
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:29,846
Yes. And you know
why I don't want to.

374
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:37,947
If I marry the priest's daughter,
all my dreams will be shattered.

375
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,654
So what do you suggest?

376
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:49,855
My friend, if you don't want
to see my joys being ruined...

377
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:55,368
in fact, if you want to
save my life from ruin...

378
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,540
You must marry her.

379
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,710
Is that all?
I'm ready right away.

380
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:09,010
This is what I expected.
You're a true friend.

381
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,548
I'll go and tell mother.

382
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:19,058
Let me make this clear.
I haven't seen the girl.

383
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,561
But I've heard she's good.
Make up your mind.

384
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:29,804
This is life. I'll be
a groom before you.

385
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,633
If I'm lucky, my bride
will be better than yours.

386
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,312
You'll feel jealous
if you ever see her.

I won't compel you
to show me your face.

00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,297
I leave that to my destiny
and your will.

438
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,232
For God's sake, however,
you must at least see how I look.

439
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:25,233
I'm squint eyed. I have huge marks
of chicken pox on my face.

440
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,437
My skin is darker than
the elephants of Africa.

441
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:35,112
And the front teeth are
protruding like an elephant's.

442
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:58,130
Subhan Allah! You're truly
more beautiful than the moon.

443
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,611
This is the greatest favour
Pyare Miyan has done me.

444
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,817
I'm dead! I'm really ruined!

445
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,150
What would you know of love?

446
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:17,482
-My body is on fire.
-Yes, sir.

447
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:22,490
-Possibly.
-I'm foaming at the mouth!

448
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,165
-Does your mouth ever foam?
-No, sir.

449
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,998
Not me. My father's
mouth would smoke.

450
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,901
-When he puffed at the pipe.
-Go away.

451
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,774
-Go and get some message!
-Be patient.

452
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:46,182
It's only till evening.
She has agreed with difficulty.

453
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,684
Her father is going out tonight.

454
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,654
-This is the best chance.
-You're the very best.

455
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:57,093
-What time?
-She's called me at dusk.

456
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:01,860
I'll meet you there.
Just be around in the garden.

457
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:07,736
If my job is done...
I'll give you this diamond ring.

458
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,369
-See how happy my heart is.
-Let's see.

459
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:15,448
Goodness me! This is beating
as fast as a rail engine.

460
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:18,313
Silly woman, that's my watch.
The heart is on this side.

461
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:19,955
But my father's heart
is on that side...

462
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,556
Don't be silly. Now go.

463
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,155
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

464
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,823
I was asking how Aslam's wife is.
She was praising her a lot.

465
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,566
When I told you,
you didn't pay heed.

466
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,565
Anyway Aslam too is like my son.

467
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,834
She may be from a poor family
but she's one in a million.

468
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,409
I want one who is one in a billion.

469
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,379
Everyone who sees her
won't keep his eyes off her.

470
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:52,579
I swear she's so pretty
that the house will light up.

471
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,423
Then we'll have to
remove the lamps.

472
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,526
-Now you're joking...
-Tell me who she is.

473
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:01,253
No. No fun if I have
to tell you.

474
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:06,398
-She'll take your breath away.
-She's taken yours away.

475
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:12,106
-Hurry up, son.
-Don't worry. It'll happen soon.

476
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,602
Don't wait up for me tonight.
I'm having dinner with Aslam.

477
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:37,623
My fate has looked up.
You are so beautiful.

478
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,503
Allah! Don't flatter me.

479
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,765
-Aslam!
-They are here.

480
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,978
Where are you?

481
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,982
Congratulations!

482
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,044
Congratulations on your marriage.

483
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:09,057
-Have you liked your wife?
-What do I say about your favours?

484
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,396
Everyday I get weighed down
in them.

485
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:15,160
By God, what a bride
you have chosen for me.

486
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,674
I feel like kissing your hand.

487
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:24,479
-Lay off!
-Let me kiss this forehead.

488
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,116
I love your destiny.
Everything you do is wrong.

489
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,843
You should have seen
the gift before giving it.

490
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,022
Jameela is one in a million.

491
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:40,257
Mine is one in a billion.
Ask him.

492
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:45,366
She brings light to his life.
My beloved is incomparable!

493
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:51,396
Let's eat dinner.
I have to go out.

494
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,700
Dinner is served.

495
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,577
God is my witness.
I'm so very nervous.

496
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:08,246
I won't be able to say
a word when I face him.

497
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:12,452
What are you scared of ?
I'll be right there with you.

498
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:17,097
I can't do this. Turn him down.

499
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:21,734
Don't do that.
He's already in love with you.

500
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:26,199
The poor man is standing
in the darkness near the kitchen.

501
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:36,083
The maid hasn't left yet.
She's doing the dishes.

502
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:42,086
Not like this...

503
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:48,095
This is better,
you're looking great!

504
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,760
This is what love does to a man.

505
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:54,994
-There's a fire raging in my heart
-Truly...

506
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,766
-Has the fire cooled down?
-Who is this insolent!

507
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:02,638
Goodness! What was that?

508
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,948
Madam! There are thieves
behind the kitchen!

509
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:10,379
You're imagining things.
Go away.

510
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,790
How terrible!
I think we must leave.

511
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,962
-No!
-How can you go to her like this?

512
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:25,531
-We'll say, it's your servant's doing.
-Then keep sitting.

513
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,804
Fine, if she comes or
else dreams in the air.

514
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,472
You stay here.
I'll call him.

515
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,812
-Where has she gone?
-Must be busy.

516
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,082
Your time has come!

517
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:53,022
-Go on.
-Sir, come on.

518
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:07,034
-Who is she?
-She's the one.

519
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:11,174
No. She's not the one.
Are you joking?

520
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,244
God! What are you saying?

521
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,280
-There!
-Run!

522

I must admit it's
also your mistake.

538
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,813
You should have stopped him.

539
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,983
Who knew about it?
He didn't tell anyone.

540
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:18,819
We left your place after dinner
and went straight there.

541
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,547
He had tied up everything
and sent Naseeban ahead.

542
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:29,225
Apart from what happened,
she wasn't the girl!

543
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:32,495
The one Pyare saw
in the fair and at home.

544
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,162
-What?
-Yes...

545
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,505
God knows what trick
Naseeban was up to.

546
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,000
For no reason she wanted
another girl to meet him.

547
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,833
God knows why.

548
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:45,241
Where is she? Ask her
the reason behind this.

549
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,314
She is missing.
She hasn't come out of fear.

550
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,852
Please, follow me.

551
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:12,866
I say, sir, may we enter?

552
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:16,140
Sure, come right in.
Sit.

553
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:23,382
-Feeling better?
-The pain must have lessened.

554
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:27,718
-How did he get hurt?
-Salutations, aunt!

555
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,156
I ask, how did he get hurt?

556
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:37,228
Hurt...yes! He was running
with a pot on his head.

557
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:39,695
He was up front,
I was following him.

558
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,903
And 4 men with sticks behind me.

559
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,900
Good grief! Did you go
to steal something?

560
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:52,904
No, this is a game.
Nawab Wajidali Shah used to love it.

561
01:02:56,973 --> 01:03:00,352
But what is this silly game
that's only played at night?

562
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:05,150
It's played in the day but if
you don't have time, play at night.

563
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:06,918
There's no restriction.

564
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,327
No more going out at nights.

565
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,329
That's right!
I'm in your shoe.

566
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:16,265
Aslam, you're quite useless!
I gave you his wife.

567
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:20,134
And you can't find him a bride.
Now hear me carefully.

568
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,469
I want him married this year.

569
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:26,943
Either you find one,
or I'll marry him to anyone.

570
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,946
I won't listen to you.

571
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:38,953
We know this man can't live
without the girl in the fair.

572
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,793
Shaida and I will go
to the fair to find her.

573
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,240
I wore this one
and he's seen it.

574
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:57,968
He said I look ravishing.
Keep this away.

575
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,405
Who wants to kill?

576
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:05,384
The trick is to make
him fall for simplicity.

577
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,321
Goodness me! What happened?

578
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,652
Say something!

579
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:19,826
-Scared you, didn't I?
-My heart stopped beating.

580
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,866
I almost died and
it was fun for you!

581
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,664
I'm the one who will
die for your beauty.

582
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:25,806
Go on.

583
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,877
Tell me, is there another
girl like you in this city?

584
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,173
The city is huge.
There must be hundreds.

585
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:37,411
-I don't believe that.
-So don't.

586
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,887
Where are you off to?

587
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:49,290
We're going to the fair,
mother has called me.

588
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,359
-I hope you don't mind.
-Not one bit.

589
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,902
In fact I'm going there too.
We'll have great fun.

590
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,870
Now I know why you were
asking about pretty girls.

591
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,941
But what can you do now?
You're stuck with me.

592
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:07,178
It's useless going there
or looking for anyone.

593
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,052
I swear by you,
I've never been there.

594
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,513
I'm going for the first time.
That too for somebody else.

595
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:17,889
Okay. Don't stare at
good ladies like a hood.

596
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,392
-I have that chance only today.
-What do you mean?

597
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,731
I'll confront you with my friends.

598
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:26,763
I'll trouble you so much
that you'll run away.

599
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,536
-My foot! I'll be in veil.
-Let's see.

600
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,065
Let's see!

601
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,412
Mother!

602
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:48,548
My darling daughter!
You look so good!

603
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:54,228
-Jameela?
-Greetings, brother.

604
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:59,427
-Where have you been
-There was no time.

605
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:02,899
You too forgot me. Didn't check
whether I'm dead or living.

606
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:06,664
May your enemies die.
You're talking nonsense.

607
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:11,769
Both brothers will come for Id.
Aslam is alone at the shop now.

608
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:14,182
-Good day.
-See you, son.

609
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:19,347
Get ready, mother.
We'll go to the fair together.

610
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:22,715
Okay, but take off
these ornaments.

611
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:28,789
There are so many thieves there.
Last time you got saved.

612
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:32,793
Those were our ornaments.
These are from your husband.

613
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:37,129
Lose one and you'll lose name.
People will misunderstand.

614
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:41,132
-Okay, mother.
-Wear small things.

615
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:46,140
Don't let anyone come close.
I'll call the servants.

616
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:05,956
Only 5 pennies. May God bless
those who give and those who don't.

-Of course. Go ahead.

649
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,598
Give us some flowers.

650

answered. May yours be too.

654
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,438
I won't talk to you.
You've forgotten me.

655
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,270
No, I'll come home
in a day or two.

656
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:50,178

make it tomorrow or else...

01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:27,815
Nab all seers and bring them
to the police station. Hurry.

662
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:33,728
Come on!

663
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,903
I wonder what's wrong...

664
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,672
-You'll be searched.
-What? Let go!

665
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,502
What's this? A camera?

666
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:51,511
What's wrong?

667
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:56,911
See that group of girls?
The black one is yours. Go.

668
01:12:57,307 --> 01:12:59,514
-Return my camera.
-In court.

669
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,188
Is it your father's?

670
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:03,080
-What's wrong?
-Not with me.

671
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,192
Those people going...
she's over there. Hurry.

672
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:08,958
So this is the matter?

673
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:11,393
-What? But...
-Come on...

674
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,362
-Where is she?
-She's just gone in.

675
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,567
Stay here.
She'll return this way.

676
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,400
-There's a door at the other end.
-Yes.

677
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,802
What if she leaves from there?
You stay at that door.

678
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,375
-How will I know her?
-They are 7 women.

679
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,680
It's the one in the black veil.

680
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,245
Hurry!

681
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,396
God bless the giver and
the one who doesn't give too.

682
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:26,868
Mendicant! You rascals!
Why did you nab a God's man?

683
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,264
Fear God.

684
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:35,282
Child, if they did
they would not arrest me.

685
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,744
But that's all right.
I forgive this ass.

686
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,218
-I'm leaving.
-Where are you going?

687
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:47,054
He's no seer.
He's a crook!

688
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,627
Look at this!

689
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:52,628
So that's how it is.

690
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,533
Looks like a family profession.

691
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,469
He's pinched someone's camera.

692
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,107
I'll open it. Maybe he's
hidden something in it.

693
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:03,107
-No! What are you doing?
-Move!

694
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:08,445
-Father!
-Bend down you fool.

695
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:20,760
I know I'm entitled to a beating.
But we'd better do that at home?

696
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,323
Quiet, you crook!
Say. Why have you done this.

697
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:33,402
I wanted to nab those who
steal disguised as cops.

698
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:34,574
Liar!

699
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:40,680
I swear I'd have caught him
if they hadn't caught me.

700
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,408
I'll get the evidence now.
I'll catch the culprit.

701
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:49,060
What are you standing for?
He can't be trusted.

702
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,087
Catch him before he runs away!

703
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,032
There he is!
Catch him!

704
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:08,266
He is the thief.
Out with the moolah.

705
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:17,445
-That's my purse!
-This wallet is mine.

706
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,713
-So...?
-No, sir!

707
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,548
Return my camera now.

708
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:29,719
I bought the camera to catch
this rascal red handed.

709
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:32,729
And show it to you.
But they spoilt everything.

710
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,731
Come here, my son.

711
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:37,960
Did you see that?
Well done.

712
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,503
Don't flatter me.
I'm your son.

713
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,739
Son, where are you going?

714
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:51,584
Another matter to be resolved.

715
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,481
No, sit with me.

716
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,760
Get a cold drink for my son.

717
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:02,594
Would you prefer something hot?

718
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:06,164
Neither. Matters there
must be turning soft.

719
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:24,775
Good grief! Found her?

720
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,783
In that carriage.

721
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:33,452
Let's follow her.

722
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,296
-Come along.
-But Shaida...?

723
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,195
Forget him. Hurry.

724
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:10,430
-Why are you standing here?
-She went in there.

725
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,166
-This house?
-Yes. Why are you surprised?

726
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:16,826
This is my uncle's house.
Sure, you're not mistaken?

727
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:21,235
Don't be silly. It's the
same girl in the black veil.

728
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:24,836
I saw her myself.
Does your uncle have a daughter?

729
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:26,644
Yes, Naseema.

730
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,709
-Is she pretty?
-Yes, very.

731
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:38,051
Give her my message and
fix things up if possible.

732
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:42,026
You troubled us so!
The girl's here and you...!

733
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,856
Hold the cycle. See you.

734
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:50,632
It was so crowded and
the dirt and grime...!

735
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,429
May I come in?

736
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,868
-Brother!
-Come in.

737
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:58,479
-Good day, aunt.
-May you live long.

738
01:18:58,668 --> 01:19:00,739
Good day.

739
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:06,009
Take a seat.
You've come after ages.

740
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,550
-You've forgotten us.
-No, but I've been busy.

741
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:13,226
Where are you coming from?

742
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:17,228
Look at him pretend.
As if he doesn't know.

743
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:20,663
-Tell me, what the matter is.
-Forget it.

744
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:25,099
Your wife told me everything.
You wagered a bet yesterday.

745
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:27,638
You would make her
confront your friends.

746
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:30,910
And trouble her.
What name did she take...?

747
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:35,908
He was following her.
Then we saw from the mausoleum...

748
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:39,917
Then you joined him.
You talked and made some signals.

749
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:45,183
We pulled your leg so much
that we had a great time.

750
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:50,454
But why do you want
strange men to see your wife?

751
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:54,127
-It's not good.
-That was a joke.

752
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,536
Actually we were looking for you.

753
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,737
Me? To scare me?

754
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:05,273
Come home tomorrow and I'll
tell you in front of the wife.

755
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:10,941
Your wife too invited me
and you too for the same day.

756
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,952
-Tell me what it's all about.
-Keep the veil. Then I'll tell.

757
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:20,358
Aunt...

758
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,461
God bless you, son!

759
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,360
If that's the case, I'm ready.

760
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,968
Shall I fix it?
You won't cancel it?

761
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,034
I'd give up the world for you.

762
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:34,970
-No change.
-Fine.

763
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:02,558
§ Heartless is my lover... §

764
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:09,473
§ he is a raging fire
and the gentle dew §

765
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:16,675
§ He's cruel at heart.
But he looks naive §

766
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:08,667
§ He's a selfish lover §

767
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:15,064
§ No one can understand him §

768
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:23,073
§ He doesn't know himself...
only God would know him §

769
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:33,082
§ One moment he's gracious;
another moment, he's furious §

770
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,591
§ He thinks he watches dramatics;
he's the joke himself §

771
01:22:54,269 --> 01:23:01,118
§ He changes attires
every now and then... §

772
01:23:52,061 --> 01:24:00,981
§ He's so unique
in his disposition §

773
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:05,777
§ He talks of love... §

774
01:24:05,975 --> 01:24:09,047
§ but his heart
is bereft of any §

775
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:19,427
§ He's so very mischievous;
his looks are misleading §

776
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:28,803
§ His heart, he wears
on his sleeve §

777
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:43,985
§ He's so unfaithful... §

778
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,988
§ what will I say to him? §

779
01:24:48,884 --> 01:24:54,129
§ He's cruel at heart;
but he looks naive §

780
01:25:29,391 --> 01:25:31,997
Old man...

781
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:38,011
Time's up. Please leave.

782
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:45,275
-My time is just beginning.
-Shaida, why the drama?

783
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:50,287
-You saw through my disguise?
-Is all well?

784
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:54,650
How can I be well? My Dad
has posted guards all over.

785
01:25:55,084 --> 01:25:58,554
If I heave a sigh,
he grabs my throat.

786
01:25:58,754 --> 01:26:06,138
How crazily in love am I.
I came flying on the wings of love.

787
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:09,639
If madam hears you,
she'll chop off those wings.

788
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:12,711
How will she if
I hide her scissors?

789
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:19,149
One of my friends is married,
the other is going to be married.

790
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:22,652
Only I am left.
Agree to marry me or else...

791
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:24,983
-Or...?
-Or...

792
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:28,487
I'll go to the forests from here.

793
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:31,994
With just one song on my lips.

794
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:36,335
My beloved can be fire and ice.

795
01:26:36,759 --> 01:26:41,333
She's cruel within
but looks vulnerable.

796
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:54,220
What a coincidence, mother.
I got Aslam married...

797
01:26:54,443 --> 01:26:57,356
and now he's get me married
to his own cousin.

798
01:26:57,813 --> 01:27:00,692
Yes, son, this is life.

799
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,987
That's what the books preach.
Marriages are made in heaven.

800
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:09,028
See this necklace.
Isn't it beautiful?

801
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:15,364
All ornaments look pretty but
I think you must take them to Aslam.

802
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:20,937
The choice of the couple
will be best.

803
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:25,749
They will get the bride to approve.
They're related, you see.

804
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:27,784
Well said. Give that to me.

805
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:45,735
Wait... I'm sitting here
and you're sweeping dust.

806
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:50,410
-Go to the men's room.
-Will you till I go?

807
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,630
Good God!

808
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:01,480
-Yes, mistress?
-The Nawab has come.

809
01:29:02,237 --> 01:29:05,480
Rehana's brother. Tell him
that my husband is at the shop.

810
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,331
-Madam says...
-What did she say?

811
01:29:20,622 --> 01:29:22,898
That he has gone to the shop.

812
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:29,397
I'll leave then.
Convey my regards. To both.

813
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:36,506
To both?

814
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:49,921
It's wonderful! Get up.

815
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:53,032
-Is all well?
-Get up first.

816
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:56,533
-Come with me.
-You won't tell me?

817
01:29:56,825 --> 01:29:59,806
What can I say?
I died again today.

818
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:03,372
-Talking in riddles again?
-She is at your house!

819
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:06,545
-Who?
-Good Lord! Naseema!

820
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:12,018
I'd forgotten
I'd invited her for today.

821
01:30:12,207 --> 01:30:15,381
Mother said to get these
approved by you and your wife.

822
01:30:16,178 --> 01:30:18,988
I opened the door
and my life was made!

823
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:23,051
Suddenly we were face to face.
I was blinded.

824
01:30:23,385 --> 01:30:27,094
She cried and ran inside and
I came to you with a thumping heart.

825
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:32,366
Hurry. And whether
she likes it or not,

826
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:38,067
have this to Naseema from me.
It's a gift for the sudden meeting.

827
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,906
-Come on.
-Very well.

828
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,181
Let my manager come.
There's nobody at the shop.

829
01:30:43,405 --> 01:30:45,282
He's just gone to the bank.
He must be on his way.

830
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:49,216
Oh no! Did he have to go
to the bank now?

831
01:30:49,511 --> 01:30:52,151
-Sit down.
-How can I sit?

832
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,256
I'm losing patience!

833
01:30:55,617 --> 01:31:02,762
Then stay here. I'll go and make
my wife and Naseema sit out.

834
01:31:03,058 --> 01:31:07,598
You open the door suddenly.
You'll see the sun and the moon.

835
01:31:08,063 --> 01:31:10,100
When both shriek
and run inside

836
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:14,213
we'll decide
whose wife is better.

837
01:31:14,503 --> 01:31:17,484
Live long, friend.
Let's shake on that.

838
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:19,777
-That's a great idea.
-I'll move on.

839
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:22,213
-On wings!
-Sure.

840
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:24,482
But don't go away before
the manager turns up.

841
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:27,354
-Go on!
-Let me wear my shoes.

842
01:31:41,396 --> 01:31:42,807
Wife, dear...

843
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:53,250
You...? What's this?

844
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:04,664
How exquisite!

845
01:32:16,465 --> 01:32:19,674
It's beautiful!
Have you brought it for me?

846
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:24,006
I'll get it if you like it.
But the Nawab has sent this one.

847
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:26,683
-For whom?
-Naseema.

848
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,551
Where is she?
First let her approve of it.

849
01:32:30,745 --> 01:32:33,225
She hasn't come yet.
I've been waiting.

850
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,353
What are you saying?

851
01:32:39,955 --> 01:32:42,697
She hasn't yet arrived.
I'm not lying.

852
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:46,703
The Nawab was here.
He just opened the door

853
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:50,800
and we were face to face.
I cried and ran in.

854
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:57,039
-You and he were face to face?
-Yes. How am I to blame?

855
01:32:57,239 --> 01:33:00,277
The maid was sweeping my room
and I went to the men's chamber.

856
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:07,421
Then the Nawab may have
seen you, not Naseema.

857
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:12,330
-Do you know him?
-Yes. We did meet.

858
01:33:12,654 --> 01:33:14,190
At his sister's birthday.

859
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:20,737
I hit him so hard on
his back so hard that...

860
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,510
<i>What a whip lash!</i>

861
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:28,270
<i>She must have stung</i>
<i>hard like a serpent!</i>

862
01:33:29,571 --> 01:33:31,346
Why didn't you tell me?

863
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:35,749
Why would a stranger's name
come to my lips for no reason?

864
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:39,554
What are you thinking?
So what if he saw me?

865
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:44,252
I'm not so bad. I'm not blind or
deaf that they'd make fun of you.

866
01:33:44,453 --> 01:33:47,434
-It's not that.
-So tell me.

867
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,770
Get me some water.

868
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:10,681
<i>First what name did she say...?</i>
<i>Some Nawab was following her...</i>

869
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:16,791
<i>then we saw you join him.</i>

870
01:34:17,252 --> 01:34:22,395
<i>We pulled such a fast one</i>
<i>that it was great fun.</i>

871
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:27,538
Water...

872
01:34:38,273 --> 01:34:41,652
Were both you and Naseema
wearing black veils that day?

873
01:34:41,976 --> 01:34:47,722
Naseema was in white. I gave
her my black veil to fool you.

874
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:51,831
Why are you silent again?
Did you wager another bet?

875
01:34:51,986 --> 01:34:54,296
That he can't see me and he did?

876
01:34:54,523 --> 01:34:56,161
This is insolence and bad manners.

877
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:58,702
Don't say anything against him.

878
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:02,705
-He's my dear friend.
-Then tell me what's wrong.

879
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:04,840
Nothing at all.

880
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:09,007
-You didn't get me any water.
-Good heavens! You just drank it.

881
01:35:12,674 --> 01:35:14,051
Get me some more.

882
01:35:29,124 --> 01:35:30,535
Here.

883
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:37,604
You are worried because of me.
I apologise.

884
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:40,213
I shouldn't have gone to that room.

885
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:44,714
Silly girl!
I'm going to the shop.

886
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:48,219
And this necklace?
Should I give it to Naseema?

887
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,891
You may keep it.

888
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:24,246
Was there any dearth of problems
that the manager doesn't turn up now?

889
01:36:36,024 --> 01:36:40,530
Your manager hasn't come.
And you have returned.

890
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:42,805
Say... did you asked her
about the necklace?

891
01:36:47,035 --> 01:36:51,279
Wonderful! You've
done a marvelous job!

892
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:54,283
You're a friend!
What are friends for anyway.

893
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:58,219
I fell in love only
supported by you and Shaida.

894
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:01,288
I'd have been happy with
the priest's simple daughter.

895
01:37:04,753 --> 01:37:06,460
You're what my heart seeks.

896
01:37:10,725 --> 01:37:12,830
She's one of a kind!

897
01:37:16,898 --> 01:37:23,816
Look at her! What a nose.
Such beautiful features!

898
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,744
-What's this?
-She's a poor girl.

899
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:29,217
Forget it. Not her!

900
01:37:31,112 --> 01:37:34,252
This is my love.

901
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:39,723
My life. She means
everything to me.

Don't be scared.
He's calling you for breakfast.

921
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:56,307
Breakfast? He borrowed
the neighbors' shoes in the morning?

922
01:42:56,504 --> 01:43:00,700
Are you mad?
Eggs, Sweetmeat...

923
01:43:01,579 --> 01:43:05,730
-Is it day or night?
-Can't you see the sun?

924
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:09,182
-Where did it rise?
-In the east.

925
01:43:09,222 --> 01:43:14,160
Either this is not the sun
Or the direction is not the east.

926
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:17,328
How can Dad call me for breakfast?

927
01:43:17,759 --> 01:43:23,334
And eggs, sweetmeat?

928
01:43:24,432 --> 01:43:27,879
He's very happy with you.
Now you even have a job.

929
01:43:28,069 --> 01:43:30,515
-He won't beat me?
-No.

930
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:37,084
You are responsible.
I hope the plan doesn't fail.

931
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,020
Come.

932
01:43:44,385 --> 01:43:46,194
In the name of God.

933
01:43:49,857 --> 01:43:51,302
Let your mother come.

934
01:44:04,205 --> 01:44:05,843
-Come on.
-Where?

935
01:44:06,007 --> 01:44:07,384
Over there...

936
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:22,659
-Good morning, father.
-Join us son.

937
01:44:23,825 --> 01:44:27,398
What is this?
Where's your fez cap?

938
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:33,276
I was drinking milk in the morning.
Must have fallen in it.

939
01:44:35,202 --> 01:44:36,840
How naughty your son is.

940
01:44:37,038 --> 01:44:41,418
I know him well. Sit down.

941
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:47,688
Mother, you sit in between.
I'm fine at my end.

942
01:44:48,516 --> 01:44:50,928
Now you may begin.

943
01:44:51,719 --> 01:44:56,259
I say, son, the Superintendent
is very happy with you.

944
01:44:56,624 --> 01:45:00,094
I told him that story of
how you nabbed the sepoy.

945
01:45:00,861 --> 01:45:03,239
He asked me about your education.

946
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:06,775
I told him you'd done your BA
and were studying law.

947
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:11,280
-And he's working hard.
-That is why he said...

948
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:14,112
"bring him immediately.
I'll appoint him as an Inspector".

949
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:17,285
My son will become an Inspector!

950
01:45:17,478 --> 01:45:21,449
The son of an Inspector
will be an Inspector, not a guard!

951
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:24,889
I accept that, on one condition.

952
01:45:25,553 --> 01:45:28,625
-What?
-I want 1O constables.

953
01:45:28,923 --> 01:45:36,307
I'll see that the scoundrels
who have turned holy,

954
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:38,477
sacred places
into theater arenas

955
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:42,978
I'll whip the skin off their backs!

956
01:45:43,271 --> 01:45:48,983
That's very good. If you work so hard,
you'll rise higher than me.

957
01:45:56,851 --> 01:46:00,230
Strange!
You came from shop, you tell.

958
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:04,495
Your employee came with money.
He waited for you till evening.

959
01:46:05,626 --> 01:46:08,698
Your employee said you haven't
gone to the shop for a week.

960
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:12,337
You didn't say anything to me.

961
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:15,514
I'm facing a small problem.

962
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:18,517
What's your problem?

963
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:23,086
Problem... actually...

964
01:46:25,312 --> 01:46:31,729
Friends got cheated
in evaluating a priceless jewel.

965
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:40,938
If the matter is to be resolved now,
one is bound to be destroyed.

966
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:43,540
How is it related to you?

967
01:46:48,102 --> 01:46:49,547
Sit down.

968
01:46:54,141 --> 01:46:55,779
Let me hear you find a solution.

969
01:46:56,644 --> 01:46:58,419
I'll follow your advice.

970
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:06,297
They were very good friends.
Like Pyare, Shaida and I.

971
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:10,228
One of them was
in search of a jewel.

972
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:13,239
He does find it unknowingly.

973
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:17,239
But he doesn't know
it's the same jewel.

974
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,841
He handed it to the friend
thinking it's just a stone.

975
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:29,319
When the friend finds out this
is the same jewel the friend wanted,

976
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:34,755
that he's still searching for it...
what should the friend do?

977
01:47:36,617 --> 01:47:38,597
I have to decide this.

978
01:47:39,887 --> 01:47:41,867
You're my wife.
You must help me.

979
01:47:43,291 --> 01:47:45,271
Make the decision for me.

980
01:47:47,694 --> 01:47:52,268
I think the friend
should return the jewel to him.

981
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:57,007
That's what I thought.

982
01:47:58,539 --> 01:48:02,453
But what if the second friend
changed the form of the jewel.

983
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:06,024
He got it fixed in a ring.

984
01:48:06,447 --> 01:48:08,484
He considers it dearer than life.

985
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:13,222
I hesitate to take a decision.

986
01:48:15,122 --> 01:48:17,102
Another name for friendship
is sacrifice.

987
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:22,634
The bigger the sacrifice,
the greater the friendship.

988
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:29,444
If you take any other decision,
it will hurt your name.

989
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,660
It will be as you please.

990
01:48:59,967 --> 01:49:04,211
-Good morning, sir.
-You are an ass!

991
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,219
Yes, sir. If you say it,
it must be true.

992
01:49:10,044 --> 01:49:13,184
Why did you tell my wife
I don't come to the shop?

993
01:49:13,447 --> 01:49:18,692
You told me to let you know
at home, if there's any work.

994
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:23,190
But how do you know
I'm always sitting with her?

995
01:49:23,624 --> 01:49:26,696
Pardon me? Then I'm really an ass.

996
01:49:29,297 --> 01:49:31,937
-Be careful in future.
-Very well.

997
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,908
And this sample?

998
01:49:34,735 --> 01:49:36,715
-Keep it somewhere.
-Very well.

999
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:41,210
-Listen...
-Yes?

1000
01:49:45,813 --> 01:49:48,726
-Do you know any way...
-Of what?

1001
01:49:51,552 --> 01:49:52,792
Separating from the wife.

1002
01:49:52,987 --> 01:49:55,399
You mean getting rid of her?

1003
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:57,531
There are thousands.

1004
01:49:59,293 --> 01:50:01,534
-For example?
-Alcohol.

1005
01:50:01,762 --> 01:50:05,574
Debauchery, singing,
dancing, fighting...

1006
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:09,339
going home after midnight.
At times not going home at all.

1007
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,750
Vanishing, etc...

1008
01:50:12,006 --> 01:50:16,216
In 2 days, the wife will get
fed up and go to her parents.

1009
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:18,957
And her parents will ask
for a divorce.

1010
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:23,417
There are other ways too.
But whom are you asking for?

1011
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:29,431
If this is only
done for show...

1012
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:35,103
I mean, the world thinks it's true...

1013
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:38,002
and he doesn't do anything. Then?

1014
01:50:38,232 --> 01:50:42,612
Then what? Haven't you heard...

1015
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:45,181
it's better to be notorious
than have no name at all.

1016
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:54,455
Go to my house this evening.
And tell my wife I'll be late.

1017
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:57,796
Good God!
So soon after marriage?

1018
01:51:19,173 --> 01:51:20,973
Looks like a storm approaching.

1019
01:51:21,013 --> 01:51:26,246
Where is Aslam?
It's ten. Is he always this late?

1020
01:51:26,286 --> 01:51:32,054
No, it must be something special.
He may have some work.

1021
01:51:32,094 --> 01:51:34,299
Where do you think he is?

1022
01:51:50,671 --> 01:51:54,380
Munnibai! I swear
I'll sell my house for you.

1023
01:52:14,595 --> 01:52:18,873
Good evening, sir.
What are you thinking?

1024
01:52:21,902 --> 01:52:23,040
What is it?

1025
01:52:23,237 --> 01:52:25,683
Your sister's husband
is going to the brothel.

1026
01:52:27,308 --> 01:52:31,085
-What is he doing here?
-There's a pimp with him.

1027
01:52:35,116 --> 01:52:37,494
Welcome, sir.

Sir, take a look at this.

1049
01:59:42,843 --> 01:59:47,314
Our shop is famous for this.

1050
01:59:56,356 --> 01:59:57,994
Good morning.

1051
02:00:00,127 --> 02:00:02,107
Come in.

1052
02:00:02,929 --> 02:00:05,239
You may leave.
Let the clothes remain.

1053
02:00:05,532 --> 02:00:07,512
You will be paid
for what we choose.

1054
02:00:08,468 --> 02:00:10,106
-Very well. Good day.
-Good day.

1055
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:16,684
Wonderful! This is how one
must prepare for weddings.

1056
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:18,685
Colourful!

1057
02:00:19,379 --> 02:00:23,020
But what's with you?
Joined the army?

1058
02:00:23,249 --> 02:00:27,789
All thanks to your love.
What fruits it yielded!

1059
02:00:28,255 --> 02:00:31,759
You'll never come
straight to the point.

1060
02:00:32,025 --> 02:00:33,561
What do you mean?

1061
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:37,037
While searching for Naseema,
I nabbed a constable.

1062
02:00:37,531 --> 02:00:42,378
My father told the Superintendent
and he was so thrilled about it.

1063
02:00:42,569 --> 02:00:46,540
He called me for an interview and
promised to make me an Inspector!

1064
02:00:46,773 --> 02:00:50,084
Now tell me, isn't it
because of your love?

1065
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:55,382
I've worn the uniform
to start practicing.

1066
02:00:55,582 --> 02:00:59,724
-That's great. Does Aslam know?
-He's not to be seen.

1067
02:01:00,019 --> 02:01:04,426
I came here to see him.
I thought you'd be together.

1068
02:01:04,466 --> 02:01:10,408
I haven't seen him for a week.
I don't know where the rascal is.

1069
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:15,360
-Yes, he might be there.
-Where?

1070
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:18,973
At my in-laws.
Might have gone to see them.

1071
02:01:19,139 --> 02:01:25,886
No. I went to the shop and
was told he doesn't come to work.

1072
02:01:26,446 --> 02:01:28,255
Something is surely wrong.

1073
02:01:28,515 --> 02:01:31,223
I asked the employee,
but he changed the topic.

1074
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:33,431
He kept putting it off.

1075
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:38,197
I think Aslam and
his wife don't get along.

1076
02:01:38,892 --> 02:01:40,929
Hence he's involved elsewhere.

1077
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:44,708
What are you saying?

1078
02:01:58,245 --> 02:02:02,716
What are you saying?
Don't you remember him praising his wife?

1079
02:02:03,249 --> 02:02:08,130
That was in the beginning.
Problems can rise soon enough.

1080
02:02:08,488 --> 02:02:11,469
No problem.
We'll check this out too.

1081
02:02:11,658 --> 02:02:13,137
Give me this.

1082
02:02:16,696 --> 02:02:18,334
Return it to me!

1083
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:24,812
By God! Which idiot
filled the hookah?

1084
02:02:26,139 --> 02:02:27,709
Sorry. You filled it?

1085
02:02:29,075 --> 02:02:32,784
Look at yourself.
You're looking so pale.

1086
02:02:33,313 --> 02:02:38,387
But you will hide.
Your brothers saw him at a brothel.

1087
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:40,490
Will they lie?

1088
02:02:42,222 --> 02:02:45,897
Mother, even if this is true,
I won't believe it.

1089
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,270
Till he comes and denies it.

1090
02:02:49,563 --> 02:02:52,510
You're blind with love
for your husband!

1091
02:02:52,899 --> 02:02:55,004
You can't see his faults!

1092
02:02:56,870 --> 02:03:03,515
If we don't nip this in the bud,
we'll cry with our head in our hands!

1093

Sir, why are your eyes
brimming with tears?

1120
02:08:46,886 --> 02:08:54,668
Nothing.
Take what you think is right.

1121
02:08:56,429 --> 02:08:59,535
I don't know the custom here.

1122
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:03,881
That's all right.
You'll learn slowly.

1123
02:09:06,373 --> 02:09:08,683
-Somebody has come.
-Let them come.

1124
02:09:09,909 --> 02:09:14,153
My aim is to meet others
who frequent this place.

1125
02:09:14,447 --> 02:09:15,425
Open the door.

1126
02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:30,434
-Shaida?
-What's wrong?

1127
02:09:30,730 --> 02:09:32,710
You took ages to open the door.

1128
02:09:37,336 --> 02:09:39,179
You are here?

1129
02:09:40,073 --> 02:09:42,053
We've been searching you for days.

1130
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:45,919
-Were you looking for me?
-There's a limit to a hunt!

1131
02:09:46,145 --> 02:09:48,125
You've driven us round the bend!

1132
02:09:49,816 --> 02:09:55,732
So I was right.
You are getting involved.

1133
02:09:59,125 --> 02:10:02,937
Listen carefully.
Why I have come here...

1134
02:10:03,129 --> 02:10:05,939
I am listening.
I'm not deaf.

1135
02:10:06,132 --> 02:10:12,276
You'll have to dance on the street
for Nawab's wedding the day after.

1136
02:10:12,472 --> 02:10:14,349
The procession will be grand.

1137
02:10:14,707 --> 02:10:17,950
-Is the wedding so soon?
-Of course.

1138
02:10:19,145 --> 02:10:22,285
Why would you know about anything?

1139
02:10:22,481 --> 02:10:25,462
-Do you know him?
-Listen to her.

1140
02:10:26,052 --> 02:10:30,120
-Have you heard
of one life and two bodies?  -Yes.

1141
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:33,137
Wrong. Absolutely wrong.
It's one life and 3 bodies.

1142
02:10:33,326 --> 02:10:35,306
Him, me and the Nawab.

1143
02:10:35,995 --> 02:10:38,441
The one for whose wedding
you have to dance.

1144
02:10:39,332 --> 02:10:43,974
I'll make a move.
Remember, my friend.

1145
02:10:44,871 --> 02:10:47,852
You'll stay, won't you?
Stay right on.

1146
02:10:48,341 --> 02:10:51,720
I think you only
have to start drinking.

1147
02:10:52,578 --> 02:10:55,991
Might do that as well.
Drink a couple of bottles.

1148
02:10:58,017 --> 02:11:00,998
Hatred spreads
in the garden of love.

1149
02:11:01,787 --> 02:11:05,166
I'm glum and you think
of poking fun.

1150
02:11:06,693 --> 02:11:08,195
I'm leaving.

1151
02:11:25,044 --> 02:11:27,684
You? And you?

1152
02:11:29,048 --> 02:11:32,689
-Is all well?
-All was well, but not any more.

1153
02:11:34,387 --> 02:11:37,231
-What do you mean?
-It's very clear.

1154
02:11:37,924 --> 02:11:39,957
In two words...

1155
02:11:39,997 --> 02:11:43,800
Either reform yourself
or divorce my sister!

1156
02:11:46,132 --> 02:11:48,112
If that's the case,
hear me out too.

1157
02:11:48,734 --> 02:11:50,611
My character is my personal affair.

1158
02:11:50,936 --> 02:11:55,851
You have no right to interfere.
As for the other,

1159
02:11:56,075 --> 02:11:59,215
it has to do with your sister.
You do have a right.

1160
02:11:59,912 --> 02:12:02,222
But first answer my questions.

1161
02:12:02,848 --> 02:12:05,385
If I do divorce her,
what happens to her?

1162
02:12:05,651 --> 02:12:10,293
We'll fight with Nawab. He cheated
our father into going to the Haj.

1163
02:12:10,523 --> 02:12:13,504
And married our sister
to a numskull like you!

1164
02:12:15,428 --> 02:12:17,305
-This is not fair.
-Definitely.

1165
02:12:17,797 --> 02:12:21,244
That's what I said.
Is the Nawab ready for it?

1166
02:12:21,501 --> 02:12:24,482
He has to be ready.
Is this a joke?

1167
02:12:24,837 --> 02:12:28,410
Fine. In that case, I'm willing
to divorce her right now.

1168
02:12:28,941 --> 02:12:30,682
By God, that too willingly.

1169
02:12:31,244 --> 02:12:35,215
But on the condition,
that she only marries the Nawab.

1170
02:12:36,115 --> 02:12:38,095
And if he doesn't agree?

1171
02:12:38,417 --> 02:12:40,397
No. Not till I die!

1172
02:12:43,889 --> 02:12:47,427
-I see. You've come to kill me?
-Undoubtedly.

1173
02:12:49,128 --> 02:12:50,766
Just a minute.

1174
02:12:57,670 --> 02:12:59,843
Don't worry.
I won't kill you.

1175
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:02,911
You are dear to me.
Take this.

1176
02:13:03,810 --> 02:13:05,847
You won't be able
to kill me with the knife.

1177
02:13:06,478 --> 02:13:08,458
With the pistol
you'll kill me in one shot.

1178
02:13:09,215 --> 02:13:11,195
There will be
no folly with this.

1179
02:13:11,517 --> 02:13:14,430
Squeeze the trigger and leave.
I'll be indebted to you!

1180
02:13:15,054 --> 02:13:16,465
Kill me. Shoot!

1181
02:13:16,656 --> 02:13:17,794
Wait!

1182
02:13:19,592 --> 02:13:21,128
My master!

1183
02:13:22,161 --> 02:13:23,469
MY Lord!

1184
02:13:24,364 --> 02:13:31,145
Now shoot. Do you want to shoot
my husband and plunge me in Hell?

1185
02:13:31,837 --> 02:13:33,612
For the love of God, shoot!

1186
02:13:35,274 --> 02:13:37,151
That's it? Scared?

1187
02:13:37,376 --> 02:13:39,413
Because the sister
is your own blood?

1188
02:13:40,646 --> 02:13:45,959
Mother, you always taught me
woman's heaven is at her man's feet.

1189
02:13:46,318 --> 02:13:49,424
Today when I want that heaven,
you raise obstacles!

1190
02:13:49,789 --> 02:13:51,769
What sorrow do I have? Wealth?

1191
02:13:52,091 --> 02:13:56,904
The cupboards are full.
7 of our generations never saw such money!

1192
02:13:57,329 --> 02:14:00,401
If he comes home at night,
stretches and dozes off.

1193
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:02,307
Do I get a chance to serve him?

1194
02:14:02,601 --> 02:14:06,174
If he comes late at night"
I'll wait up all night for him.

1195
02:14:06,606 --> 02:14:09,177
Then I'll feed him like a slave.

1196
02:14:09,542 --> 02:14:13,388
Press his legs till he sleeps.
That's how I'll attain heaven!

1197
02:14:13,612 --> 02:14:16,354
-Listen, dear...
-No, you listen!

1198
02:14:17,216 --> 02:14:21,528
And you too. I'm his
servant not his wife!

1199
02:14:22,221 --> 02:14:24,929
I can lay down my life
for one smile from him.

1200
02:14:25,758 --> 02:14:28,602
Now shoot and make
both of us martyrs!

1201
02:14:31,697 --> 02:14:34,735
Where are you going?
Hear this before you go.

1202
02:14:35,234 --> 02:14:39,410
What you thought was terrible.
Don't ever show me your face again.

1203
02:14:40,039 --> 02:14:43,885
Jameela is dead for you
and you are dead for me!

1204
02:14:55,721 --> 02:14:58,964
We're complaining to you
because you fixed this marriage.

1205
02:14:59,492 --> 02:15:03,235
And believe me, every word
of what I said is true.

1206
02:15:06,265 --> 02:15:08,245
I've heard that from Shaida.

1207
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:13,977
Now go home and convey
my greetings to your mother.

1208
02:15:15,641 --> 02:15:17,848
Also tell her,
I'm alive not dead.

1209
02:15:19,345 --> 02:15:21,325
Her daughter will not be hurt.

1210
02:15:22,548 --> 02:15:25,119
-Believe me.
-You are very gracious.

1211
02:15:34,693 --> 02:15:36,673
Tell me how to stop this.

1212
02:15:37,163 --> 02:15:40,542
That's what I'm thinking about.
Sameeran did tell me.

1213
02:15:40,733 --> 02:15:43,612
Each time he goes there,
Aslam keeps repeating

1214
02:15:43,836 --> 02:15:46,749
he asks for methods by which
to be separated from his wife.

1215
02:15:47,006 --> 02:15:50,715
You're a jerk!
What's there to think?

1216
02:15:51,644 --> 02:15:54,625
Actually he wants
to marry Sameeran.

1217
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:57,718
He has no other reason
for leaving his wife.

1218
02:15:58,317 --> 02:16:00,297
Everybody knows that.

1219
02:16:00,486 --> 02:16:03,194
Don't talk like this.
My pants are falling off!

1220
02:16:03,389 --> 02:16:06,370
That's what I'm saying. Use a trick
or you'll lose your brain too!

1221
02:16:08,761 --> 02:16:11,966
Lose my head?
Mine or Aslam's?

1222
02:16:12,006 --> 02:16:13,477
He has lost his head.

1223
02:16:13,900 --> 02:16:16,506
And if Sameeran leaves,
you too will go nuts.

1224
02:16:16,702 --> 02:16:20,548
-But she's mine.
-You really are a jerk!

1225
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:22,845
-That's how?
-Ok. Sit here.

1226
02:16:24,743 --> 02:16:27,917
I told you women
are unpredictable.

1227
02:16:28,347 --> 02:16:30,725
Some try to possess them
knowingly, others unknowingly.

1228
02:16:30,917 --> 02:16:32,658
I've had it!

1229
02:16:33,352 --> 02:16:37,732
She'd always say, you
threaten to be a policeman.

1230
02:16:38,057 --> 02:16:40,731
Someday I'll vanish and
you'll be left hunting.

1231
02:16:40,926 --> 02:16:43,736
Right. Now what's the intention?

1232
02:16:44,363 --> 02:16:47,742
If he likes Sameeran, she's his.

1233
02:16:48,634 --> 02:16:54,346
I think if a friend can't make
this little sacrifice, he's no good.

1234
02:16:54,740 --> 02:16:56,947
Bravo! Well said.

1235
02:16:57,376 --> 02:16:59,356
-You call this a sacrifice?
-Yes.

1236
02:16:59,545 --> 02:17:01,684
This is no sacrifice,
it's murdering a friend!

1237
02:17:01,947 --> 02:17:04,188
In fact, a mass murder.

1238
02:17:05,718 --> 02:17:09,954
How? If both Aslam and Sameeran
are in love, who gets killed?

1239
02:17:09,955 --> 02:17:12,697
Mine, Aslam's and
possibly yours too!

1240
02:17:13,559 --> 02:17:15,971
-What have I done?
-Listen.

1241
02:17:16,395 --> 02:17:21,037
Sameeran only has to go to Aslam's
house and these men will kill him.

1242
02:17:21,533 --> 02:17:25,379
In grief, Aslam's wife
will grab my throat.

1243
02:17:25,737 --> 02:17:27,375
That is their old wish.

1244
02:17:28,407 --> 02:17:31,217
But I won't marry
my dead friend's widow.

1245
02:17:31,977 --> 02:17:34,583
But yes, both the brothers
will be shot dead by me.

1246
02:17:37,416 --> 02:17:41,387
-Then...?
-Then I'll be hanged!

1247
02:17:42,188 --> 02:17:45,567
I will die, so will Aslam
and the 2 brothers.

1248
02:17:45,757 --> 02:17:50,228
Sameeran too will die.
Not you, because you're shameless.

1249
02:17:50,629 --> 02:17:52,802
But you'll be out of
your mind for some days.

1250
02:17:53,098 --> 02:17:55,078
Now tell me isn't it mass murder?

1251
02:17:56,302 --> 02:18:00,808
My pant will surely fall off.
You've frozen my blood.

1252
02:18:04,443 --> 02:18:06,980
I mean Pyare, tell me
what is to be done.

1253
02:18:07,279 --> 02:18:08,314
What is to be done?

1254
02:18:10,516 --> 02:18:12,689
Be brave and shut
Sameeran's door forever.

1255
02:18:12,885 --> 02:18:17,425
What? If I shut the door
how will I get in?

1256
02:18:17,623 --> 02:18:19,603
How will she get out to meet me?

1257
02:18:19,825 --> 02:18:22,669
-Just think...
-You never understand.

1258
02:18:22,862 --> 02:18:26,435
I mean, for Aslam.
I'll go to knock sense into him.

1259
02:18:27,199 --> 02:18:29,839
-Ready?
-Of course.

1260
02:18:30,469 --> 02:18:33,848
At a place wherever
stands to benefit!

1261
02:18:33,973 --> 02:18:39,446
I'll change, take some papers
from the police station and get there.

1262
02:18:39,645 --> 02:18:41,852
I'm going to straighten it out!

1263
02:18:50,489 --> 02:18:55,461
I'm a very inconsiderate man.
I have put you to a lot of trouble.

1264
02:18:58,497 --> 02:19:02,877
This thing about friends
has landed me in a dilemma.

1265
02:19:03,903 --> 02:19:08,477
I got so worried that
I didn't know where I went.

1266
02:19:11,176 --> 02:19:12,951
Yet the answer eluded me.

1267
02:19:14,981 --> 02:19:17,359
That's my mistake, not yours.

1268
02:19:18,517 --> 02:19:20,758
-What are you saying?
-That's right.

1269
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:23,898
I should not have stepped
into the men's section.

1270
02:19:24,757 --> 02:19:31,504
When we did meet, I shouldn't
have told you I'd seen him earlier.

1271
02:19:32,531 --> 02:19:35,512
And that I had one day
mistakenly hit him, too.

1272
02:19:36,535 --> 02:19:38,515
That is what has put you in doubt.

1273
02:19:38,838 --> 02:19:43,514
You thought he was here to see me.
And that I had also...

1274
02:19:43,709 --> 02:19:46,918
Wife! Don't talk like that.

1275
02:19:47,946 --> 02:19:52,520
I made a mistake and
you also slipped up.

1276
02:19:53,552 --> 02:19:55,532
You have insulted me
by saying such things.

1277
02:19:56,154 --> 02:19:58,930
-And my friend's more than mine.
-I swear, it's true.

1278
02:19:59,558 --> 02:20:06,942
If you are worried about something,
or have taken a fancy to someone else...

1279
02:20:07,866 --> 02:20:09,937
bring her home.

1280
02:20:10,635 --> 02:20:15,209
I'll stay like her sister.
We will serve you with all our heart.

1281
02:20:20,579 --> 02:20:22,559
You are so kind.

1282
02:20:26,017 --> 02:20:28,054
The Nawab has come.

1283
02:20:31,824 --> 02:20:33,565
-Send him in.
-Good grief!

1284
02:20:33,759 --> 02:20:37,070
Stay right here.
I want him to see you.

1285
02:20:37,329 --> 02:20:39,935
-Please let me go!
-I want you to stay.

1286
02:20:40,132 --> 02:20:42,373
Let me go. It's impossible!

1287
02:20:42,601 --> 02:20:45,047
-For God's sake!
-Come in.

1288
02:20:46,204 --> 02:20:50,311
-Pyare Miyan?
-I bind you by oath to let me go!

1289
02:21:02,621 --> 02:21:04,396
Come in.

1290
02:21:08,226 --> 02:21:09,933
Somebody open the door.

1291
02:21:26,845 --> 02:21:28,415
Good day.

1292
02:21:32,651 --> 02:21:36,428
-You're really in form.
-Yes.

1293
02:21:37,122 --> 02:21:38,897
I want you to do something.

1294
02:21:39,157 --> 02:21:41,797
-Will you do it quietly or...
-I see.

1295
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:44,963
-How domineering!
-Hurry.

1296
02:21:46,231 --> 02:21:48,142
My master, tell me the job.

1297
02:21:48,667 --> 02:21:50,146
What must I do?

1298
02:21:50,902 --> 02:21:57,217
Whatever Aslam has spent
on you in all these days

1299
02:21:57,509 --> 02:22:00,979
I mean cash, etc...

1300
02:22:01,246 --> 02:22:04,989
-Give it to me.
-Is that all?

1301
02:22:05,384 --> 02:22:09,298
You could have sent somebody.
I'd have given it.

1302
02:22:09,488 --> 02:22:12,662
-Present it.
-Right away.

1303
02:22:12,858 --> 02:22:14,166
All right.

1304
02:22:27,206 --> 02:22:28,685
Here you are.

1305
02:22:29,708 --> 02:22:31,688
10, 20...is this all?

1306
02:22:31,877 --> 02:22:33,686
This is what he gave me
the first time.

1307
02:22:33,879 --> 02:22:35,859
-Then?
-Then you came over.

1308
02:22:36,148 --> 02:22:38,856
You said to remember
he's your friend.

1309
02:22:39,051 --> 02:22:40,553
Consider him like me.

1310
02:22:40,719 --> 02:22:42,528
-Do you remember?
-I do.

1311
02:22:42,721 --> 02:22:46,430
Your saying this was enough.
He often came after that.

1312
02:22:47,058 --> 02:22:48,696
He tried to give me money.

1313
02:22:49,227 --> 02:22:54,142
I didn't lift my eyes.
He's a gentleman.

1314
02:22:55,267 --> 02:23:00,376
If he ever said anything,
it was with a deep sigh...

1315
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:03,877
"Can you help me forget my wife?"

1316
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:08,221
I still haven't understood this.

1317
02:23:08,747 --> 02:23:12,194
-Can you explain?
-You don't need to understand!

1318
02:23:12,617 --> 02:23:15,928
Your doors should not open
for Aslam henceforth.

1319
02:23:16,121 --> 02:23:17,725
Understand? Call your madam.

1320
02:23:17,956 --> 02:23:20,994
I said, I won't open it.
Why must you call madam?

1321
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:24,500
You wanted to take advantage
of Shaida's friendship.

1322
02:23:24,996 --> 02:23:29,069
You are so blind that
you can't see your path!

1323
02:23:29,768 --> 02:23:33,272
You run away from me because
you think I'm an obstacle!

1324
02:23:34,039 --> 02:23:37,748
But this won't happen
as long as you live.

1325
02:23:39,778 --> 02:23:42,759
What do you want?
Yes? To malign me?

1326
02:23:43,182 --> 02:23:44,559
What do you want?

1327
02:23:44,783 --> 02:23:47,024
You made a promise.
You forgot me.

1328
02:23:47,486 --> 02:23:49,295
You forgot the duty of a friend.

1329
02:23:50,622 --> 02:23:53,603
I'm trying to do the duty
of a friend, my friend.

1330
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:56,765
-How can I explain?
-You can't.

1331
02:23:57,495 --> 02:24:00,942
The way you behave is not
the way friends must behave.

1332
02:24:05,804 --> 02:24:07,943
Why do you want
to ruin me and yourself

1333
02:24:08,306 --> 02:24:09,785
What do you want?

1334
02:24:09,975 --> 02:24:13,787
-Should I leave?
-No.

1335
02:24:15,647 --> 02:24:18,560
Now tell me, what's wrong with you.

1336
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:21,230
Why have you become like this?

1337
02:24:22,821 --> 02:24:25,131
It's a trick played by destiny.

1338
02:24:25,824 --> 02:24:29,067
But now I won't give you
opportunity to complain.

1339
02:24:30,996 --> 02:24:32,976
You've taken a load off my chest.

1340
02:24:33,832 --> 02:24:36,039
Now I must leave.
Get ready and come soon.

1341
02:24:36,535 --> 02:24:39,812
There's so much work.
I can't handle all myself.

1342
02:24:40,839 --> 02:24:46,585
Tell your wife I arranged
your marriage myself.

1343
02:24:47,012 --> 02:24:49,652
There should be nothing lacking
from her side for my wedding!

1344
02:24:49,914 --> 02:24:50,892
Okay!

1345
02:24:58,022 --> 02:25:00,002
What a coincidence.

1346
02:25:02,561 --> 02:25:04,165
Why are you talking to yourself?

1347
02:25:07,332 --> 02:25:08,640
You...

1348
02:25:09,367 --> 02:25:12,837
I was thinking Naseema
will get married tomorrow.

1349
02:25:13,271 --> 02:25:15,376
Not your Nawab's?

1350
02:25:16,208 --> 02:25:19,382
He... will face the music.

1351
02:25:20,078 --> 02:25:23,059
Women are a nuisance for men.

1352
02:25:23,882 --> 02:25:27,523
Like I am for you.
Nawab was quite mad at you.

1353
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:32,133
Can this marriage
somehow be canceled?

1354
02:25:32,690 --> 02:25:34,727
Is that what friendship is worth?

1355
02:25:35,060 --> 02:25:40,373
He scolded you for your good
and you've turned into his enemy!

1356
02:25:40,698 --> 02:25:45,272
You yourself arranged their
wedding. Now you want it stopped.

1357
02:25:45,737 --> 02:25:51,619
This marriage should be stopped.
Else our friendship will be stained.

1358
02:25:52,110 --> 02:25:54,283
Good God! Are you mad?

1359
02:25:54,713 --> 02:25:58,354
Both families are full
of guests. The city is agog.

1360
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:01,458
Collectors, judges...
all have come.

1361
02:26:01,786 --> 02:26:03,288
Marriage is no child's play.

1362
02:26:40,025 --> 02:26:44,201
Mother, Nasreen,
Azra, everyone has come.

1363
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:48,204
But Jameela and brother
Aslam haven't turned up.

1364
02:26:48,466 --> 02:26:51,777
They must be on the way.
Maybe they are with the Nawab.

1365
02:27:01,112 --> 02:27:03,092
<i>Jameela says this</i>
<i>wedding can't be stopped.</i>

1366
02:27:04,316 --> 02:27:06,296
<i>No way can it be stopped.</i>

1367
02:27:10,188 --> 02:27:11,963
<i>You must stop them.</i>

1368
02:27:12,156 --> 02:27:14,136
<i>This will be the second</i>
<i>betrayal of a friend.</i>

1369
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:18,439
<i>He gave you your life.</i>

1370
02:27:18,997 --> 02:27:20,977
<i>Today his life is in danger.</i>

1371
02:27:21,666 --> 02:27:26,638
<i>Though he brought it on himself.</i>

1372
02:27:27,439 --> 02:27:31,319
<i>His precious jewel is with you.</i>

1373
02:27:39,017 --> 02:27:41,998
<i>After knowing all, you're</i>
<i>tying your sister's life to his.</i>

1374
02:27:43,154 --> 02:27:47,330
<i>You will lead your life without</i>
<i>Jameela with a stone on your heart.</i>

1375
02:27:48,026 --> 02:27:52,338
<i>But you know he won't even</i>
<i>let Naseema touch his feet.</i>

1376
02:27:55,033 --> 02:27:57,013
<i>This will be a cross</i>
<i>you'll bear all your life.</i>

1377
02:27:57,936 --> 02:27:59,916
<i>This marriage will</i>
<i>mean death for Nawab.</i>

1378
02:28:00,538 --> 02:28:03,018
<i>Stop this wedding!</i>

1379
02:28:03,208 --> 02:28:08,521
<i>How? There's only one way.</i>

1380
02:28:09,714 --> 02:28:13,025
<i>My death.</i>

1381
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:18,257
<i>This marriage will be postponed</i>
<i>because you're a close relative.</i>

1382
02:28:19,190 --> 02:28:21,033
<i>After you are no more...</i>

1383
02:28:21,226 --> 02:28:25,038
<i>Jameela can marry the Nawab.</i>

1384
02:28:26,064 --> 02:28:28,305
<i>Can you make this sacrifice</i>
<i>for your friend?</i>

1385
02:28:29,067 --> 02:28:30,444
Of course!

1386
02:28:50,421 --> 02:28:52,401
Today is the wedding.

1387
02:28:56,261 --> 02:28:59,902
I said, today your sister
and friend are getting married.

1388
02:29:00,098 --> 02:29:01,736
Won't you go?

1389
02:29:03,268 --> 02:29:06,249
-I was planning on leaving.
-Pardon?

1390
02:29:09,106 --> 02:29:12,417
-You aren't dressed either.
-I'll be in a moment.

1391
02:29:16,181 --> 02:29:18,422
-Wife!
-Yes?

1392
02:29:20,118 --> 02:29:22,098
Wear the wedding dress.

1393
02:29:22,453 --> 02:29:24,831
I want to see you
dressed as a bride.

1394
02:29:25,390 --> 02:29:29,896
Naseema is getting married
and you're making me the bride.

1395
02:29:30,128 --> 02:29:34,508
Don't argue.
Time is running out.

1396
02:29:44,342 --> 02:29:52,318
Before dying let me see you.

1397
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:07,307
Yes, mother?

1398
02:30:11,602 --> 02:30:15,573
Son, you're perspiring.
Take a breath.

1399
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:18,250
There's so much work
and I'm all alone.

1400
02:30:18,443 --> 02:30:22,414
What happened to your friends?
Shaida is what he is.

1401
02:30:22,613 --> 02:30:25,594
Aslam should have been here.
He's not seen.

1402
02:30:25,783 --> 02:30:27,558
-Must be on his way.
-High hopes.

1403
02:30:27,752 --> 02:30:29,891
He would have
come 2 days earlier.

1404
02:30:30,522 --> 02:30:35,835
You've done so much for him.
But he's not ready to help you.

1405
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:37,630
No. My friends aren't like that.

1406
02:30:38,196 --> 02:30:40,176
Something must have happened.

1407
02:30:41,199 --> 02:30:42,872
I'll go and get him right now.

1408
02:30:43,034 --> 02:30:45,412
Where are you going?
Send a servant.

1409
02:30:45,636 --> 02:30:47,843
Stepping out of the house
is inauspicious for you.

1410
02:30:48,039 --> 02:30:49,780
I'll be back in no time.

1411
02:30:51,009 --> 02:30:52,545
I say, don't go...

1412
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:56,982
It will bring bad luck. Stop!

1413
02:30:58,015 --> 02:31:02,521
Mother, my heart is beating hard.

1414
02:31:03,221 --> 02:31:06,202
Jameela and Aslam still haven't come.

1415
02:31:07,225 --> 02:31:09,728
Don't worry. I'll send somebody.

1416
02:31:14,899 --> 02:31:19,746
Here I am! Now tell me what's
to be done, given, taken...

1417
02:31:20,972 --> 02:31:22,417
-Where's the Nawab?
-No idea.

1418
02:31:28,246 --> 02:31:30,226
-Sounds like Shaida
-Yes.

1419
02:31:32,417 --> 02:31:35,955
-Yes, madam?
-Ask Shaida to come in.

1420
02:31:37,722 --> 02:31:39,702
Today I'll crown him!

1421
02:31:39,890 --> 02:31:42,393
Brother will be crowned! Great!

1422
02:31:45,596 --> 02:31:49,738
The guests have arrived
but the groom is missing.

1423
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:53,447
Where are you?

1424
02:31:54,372 --> 02:31:56,249
Madam has sent for you.

1425
02:31:56,441 --> 02:31:59,251
Me? Help me, God.

1426
02:32:08,186 --> 02:32:11,258
-Good day.
-Rascal! Now you come!

1427
02:32:11,522 --> 02:32:13,263
No, I've been working
since morning.

1428
02:32:13,424 --> 02:32:17,270
Don't lie. Since yesterday
you and Aslam are missing.

1429
02:32:17,729 --> 02:32:20,039
-Pyare has gone to get him.
-Is that so?

1430
02:32:20,231 --> 02:32:23,110
Yes. I told him not to go,
but he paid no heed.

1431
02:32:23,668 --> 02:32:24,951
Quickly bring him back.

1432
02:32:24,991 --> 02:32:28,450
That's all?
Assume I'm already back.

1433
02:32:35,313 --> 02:32:38,021
Place this ornament on the side.

1434
02:32:38,716 --> 02:32:41,287
God! What's wrong with you?
Now stop it.

1435
02:32:41,486 --> 02:32:44,296
Everyone must be waiting.
It's almost evening.

1436
02:32:45,323 --> 02:32:47,303
Evening comes everyday.

1437
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:50,901
-But this evening..
-...will be the best!

1438
02:32:52,464 --> 02:32:54,444
-For you.
-And you...?

1439
02:32:55,400 --> 02:32:58,813
This might be the last evening.

1440
02:32:59,337 --> 02:33:01,180
Good grief! Why do you say that?

1441
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:06,311
One evening is yours
and one is mine.

1442
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:19,197
-Where's Aslam?
-God knows what's wrong with him.

1443
02:33:19,490 --> 02:33:21,470
He's dressing his wife as a bride.

1444
02:33:28,166 --> 02:33:29,804
Now you're a bride.

1445
02:33:30,134 --> 02:33:32,774
You're very romantic today.
What's the matter?

1446
02:33:33,170 --> 02:33:35,150
You dressed me up yourself.

1447
02:33:35,540 --> 02:33:40,114
Yet not once did you say,
Good God! Your killing looks!

1448
02:33:40,378 --> 02:33:43,825
-Lightning strikes.
-Yes, it has struck.

1449
02:33:45,316 --> 02:33:47,557
I will sacrifice myself for you!

1450
02:33:48,486 --> 02:33:50,864
The world will see.

1451
02:33:52,190 --> 02:33:54,363
What are you saying?

1452
02:33:56,528 --> 02:34:01,238
Cover your face, then lift
the veil like the first time.

1453
02:34:12,843 --> 02:34:14,823
Beautiful!

1454
02:34:15,813 --> 02:34:17,793
You're really beautiful!

1455
02:34:19,417 --> 02:34:21,590
This is the greatest
favour Pyare did for me.

1456
02:34:24,555 --> 02:34:28,970
<i>This is Aslam's wife!</i>
<i>She's his wife!</i>

1457
02:34:39,237 --> 02:34:40,215
What happened?

1458
02:34:46,711 --> 02:34:48,213
What happened?

1459
02:34:53,751 --> 02:34:55,424
Say something!

1460
02:34:59,457 --> 02:35:04,429
He stood here, heard
something and ran out scared.

1461
02:35:04,863 --> 02:35:07,776
-The Nawab was standing here?
-Yes, for quite sometime.

1462
02:35:11,469 --> 02:35:12,971
The secret has been revealed.

1463
02:35:13,471 --> 02:35:16,247
What secret?
Listen to me!

1464
02:36:13,330 --> 02:36:16,971
This marriage will not happen.

1465
02:36:18,802 --> 02:36:20,110
Mother!

1466
02:36:38,556 --> 02:36:39,933
Mother!

1467
02:36:42,059 --> 02:36:43,538
My son, what happened?

1468
02:36:43,728 --> 02:36:46,709
Stop this marriage.
It will ruin us!

1469
02:36:46,964 --> 02:36:52,073
What ruin? What are you saying?

1470
02:36:53,571 --> 02:36:57,542
Did you hear? He wants us
to stop the marriage!

1471
02:36:57,909 --> 02:37:00,048
Silly boy! How?

1472
02:37:00,277 --> 02:37:03,019
It will ruin me!

1473
02:37:05,249 --> 02:37:06,956
He has gone mad.

1474
02:37:13,591 --> 02:37:15,298
Oh, my Lord!

1475
02:37:45,623 --> 02:37:46,601
Good Lord!

1476
02:37:48,693 --> 02:37:51,936
<i>I had brought these ornaments</i>
<i>for you and your wife to choose</i>

1477
02:37:52,730 --> 02:37:57,475
<i>We came face to face</i>
<i>the moment the door opened</i>

1478
02:37:57,902 --> 02:38:01,611
<i>My eyes got blinded.</i>
<i>She cried out and ran that way.</i>

1479
02:38:01,839 --> 02:38:03,944
<i>And I came to you</i>
<i>with a thumping heart</i>

1480
02:38:05,743 --> 02:38:10,419
<i>Sameeran said, each time</i>
<i>he comes there, he always says</i>

1481
02:38:10,648 --> 02:38:13,822
<i>"tell me a way to be</i>
<i>separated from my wife"</i>

1482
02:38:17,655 --> 02:38:19,635
<i>You forgot your promise!</i>
<i>You forgot me!</i>

1483
02:38:19,991 --> 02:38:21,971
<i>The duty of a friend!</i>

1484
02:38:23,194 --> 02:38:25,970
<i>I'm trying to do the duty</i>
<i>of a friend, my friend</i>

1485
02:38:27,665 --> 02:38:28,643
<i>How do I explain?</i>

1486
02:38:30,668 --> 02:38:32,648
<i>This will give my heart peace</i>

1487
02:38:33,804 --> 02:38:36,045
<i>She's one of her kind</i>

1488
02:38:40,111 --> 02:38:43,649
<i>Look at her expression.</i>
<i>Isn't she exquisite?</i>

1489
02:38:44,415 --> 02:38:47,328
<i>These features, this nose</i>
<i>Good God!</i>

1490
02:38:49,787 --> 02:38:53,166
What have I done!

1491
02:38:56,294 --> 02:38:58,001
I've committed a grave sin!

1492
02:38:59,697 --> 02:39:01,472
I've committed a grave sin!

1493
02:39:01,699 --> 02:39:03,679
What have I done?

1494
02:39:03,868 --> 02:39:05,848
Allah! What have I done?

1495
02:39:33,130 --> 02:39:34,700
Come to your senses.

1496
02:39:37,168 --> 02:39:38,875
Where is Pyare?

1497
02:39:39,069 --> 02:39:42,983
She's unconscious.
Pyare must be in his room.

1498
02:39:43,274 --> 02:39:46,380
He said, "Stop the marriage.
It will ruin everyone"

1499
02:40:07,765 --> 02:40:10,143
Open the door!

1500
02:40:15,573 --> 02:40:17,211
Open the door!

1501
02:40:43,634 --> 02:40:46,205
What have you done?

1502
02:40:47,271 --> 02:40:50,252
Call the doctor.
He has swallowed poison!

1503
02:40:50,808 --> 02:40:52,788
The Nawab has swallowed poison!

1504
02:40:58,816 --> 02:41:00,796
The Nawab has swallowed poison!

1505
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:05,630
The Nawab has swallowed poison!

1506
02:41:05,923 --> 02:41:08,460
What have you done!

1507
02:41:13,163 --> 02:41:17,305
I have atoned for my sins,
my friend.

1508
02:41:17,835 --> 02:41:23,615
-What are you saying?
-My friend...

1509
02:41:23,841 --> 02:41:28,290
no one must get to know
what I have done.

1510
02:41:29,847 --> 02:41:34,762
You must keep it a secret.

1511
02:41:40,257 --> 02:41:43,363
Go on, Aslam...

1512
02:41:46,997 --> 02:41:48,374
My son!

1513
02:41:57,207 --> 02:41:58,845
My son!

1514
02:42:03,381 --> 02:42:07,295
You were to be
the bridegroom today!

1515
02:42:07,652 --> 02:42:09,632
Where have you gone?

1516
02:42:13,023 --> 02:42:16,197
What have you done, my son?

1517
02:42:22,232 --> 02:42:25,702
The Nawab has swallowed poison!

1518
02:42:45,923 --> 02:42:47,903
What happened?
