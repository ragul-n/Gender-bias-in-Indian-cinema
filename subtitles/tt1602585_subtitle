1
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:26,936
Of all the girls in the world why did
l fall in love with Jessie?

2
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,634
This is Jessie

3
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:39,039
So beautiful...educated...
She has a style of her own...

4
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:47,503
lf l took Jessie home and told my mom,
''l want to marry her''

5
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,435
l am sure my mom
will happily agree

6
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:54,036
But why did l love her?
What's the problem?

7
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,968
She is getting married...
that's the problem!

8
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:04,635
Can we decide whom
we fall in love with?

9
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,037
We can't go in search of love...
It won't last long.

10
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,171
lt has to happen of its own...
It has spellbound us...turn our life topsy turvy!

11
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:19,502
lt has to be with us always
That's true love...

12
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,300
lt happened to me...

13
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:26,270
Actually l didn't choose Jessie...
Love made me fall for her.

14
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,101
This is me...
My name is Karthik

15
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,604
l finished engineering...
did a few odd jobs...finally... jobless...

16
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:35,433
l was in search of a well-known director
to become his assistant

17
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,433
Cinema is life...

18
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:42,599
Out!

19
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,635
l brought them all to see you make
a century, you got out for duck.

20
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,300
He bowled full toss.

21
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,500
Only ten are here,
where's the eleventh man?

22
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:54,369
The money l had was just
what my dad gave as pocket money...

23
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,169
good friends...plenty of dreams
...it was such a time...

24
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,369
Though your marks are less,
but l've talked to them.

25
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,934
You've to join the job next week.

26
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,436
l knew the day l joined engineering,
l knew l can't concentrate on it.

27
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,168
My life is only cinema...

28
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,033
That means?

29
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,437
l want to join as assistant under a director
Iearn the technic...direct films...

30
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:24,034
l have written lots of stories, father.

31
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:27,302
There are many directors
waiting for my dates.

32
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,501
l'll make you assistant
to some director.

33
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,368
Father...father...

34
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:39,169
Whom do you want to work with Karthik?
- Gautham Menon.

35
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,600
Are you going to make Tamil films?

36
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:43,435
No, it seems he's making
a Telugu film with Mahesh Babu.

37
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,302
Didn't Mahesh Babu find anyone else?

38
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:50,169
There are many big directors in Telugu,

39
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:54,169
besides, Gautham Menon takes
_o years to complete a film.

40
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,601
l knew you would come to me
after getting kicked around.

41
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,168
l have what you want,
take it if you can.

42
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,033
This is the shot, come.

43
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:19,499
Fine.

44
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,635
He's Karthik, the boy l told you...
who is interested...

45
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,367
Yeah...did engineering?

46
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,167
He looks more like a hero...
may show interest acting later.

47
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,167
No. He'll work hard.

48
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:31,368
Direction department only?- Yes sir.
Not interested in acting?- No sir.

49
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,501
ln my next film Krishna
is playing a good role,

50
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,935
Krishna will be in touch with me,
you keep in touch wit him.

51
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,634
How he came,
how he became a goon...

52
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,968
and finally how he became Billa,
this is the story.

53
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,433
Super buddy!

54
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,501
When you narrate the story,
l can see it before my eyes.

55
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:48,169
Tell me, when will you start it?
l'll reduce my weight.

56
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:49,500
This story is ideal for Prabhas.

57
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,601
Have you shifted to this place?
House is very nice.

58
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,635
New home will be ready in six months,
we'll shift there.

59
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,634
Did you have any tiff
with upstairs people?

60
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,368
No. Come...come.

61
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,301
You've become a great actor.

62
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,169
Yes, we shouldn't allow you in first.
Are you supporting him?

63
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,167
Uncle, please don't discard
us so easily.

64
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,934
l'm not here to support his cause.

65
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,437
To narrate a story to a hero,
one needs good communication skill,

66
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
he has it.

67
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,035
lf not l wouldn't support him.

68
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,266
Just give him some time, uncle.

69
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:30,602
lt was a time life was dull and dry.

70
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,036
That's when l saw her...Jessie!

71
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,934
Love made me fall for her.

72
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:38,508
Don't go melting away my heart...

73
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:48,475
My other heart will not leave you...

74
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,635
What's this?
- What's this on road?

75
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,034
Nothing father.
Nothing....for cinema...

76
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,468
Cinema? To hell with your cinema.
- Have you gone mad?

77
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,504
Though so many beautiful girls went before me,
my heart never skipped a beat...

78
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,702
You came just a while ago
and cast a spell on me...

79
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,701
My heart is somersaulting...

80
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,502
Hosanna (Cy of praise)!
Air smells like you...

81
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,235
Hosanna (Cy of praise)!
When l see you in flowers...

82
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,968
Whichever way you go,
will it change my routine?

83
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,569
l can't hold myself anymore...

84
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,134
l'm giving up to breathe...

85
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,501
l'm living in imagination...

86
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:57,137
You're on earth like cloud
carying colou_ul raindrops...

87
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,504
You're unreachable like honeycomb
on the tip of high branches...

88
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,035
Won't the cloud turn into rain?

89
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:06,833
Won't the branch give honey?

90
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,635
Won't you come to me?
Won't you ease my pining for you?

91
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,969
l'm not an adversay to you, right?

92
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,467
l'm giving up my lifespan...

93
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,701
Living in dreams...

94
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,534
They are Christians...
Malayalee Christians.

95
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,534
Hope you know her name?

96
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,401
We are Naidus, hope you know that!

97
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,670
Even if you convince Jessie
her father will never accept.

98
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:11,167
That's guaranty.

99
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,536
The moment l saw her l knew
you would fall for her!

100
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,835
Don't...you will end up in big trouble.

101
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,734
You will have to elope.

102
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,536
Why take trouble?
Put an end to it right now.

103
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,201
Besides, her dad is a lawyer.

104
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:28,334
Who told you?
Did your sister Anu told you all this?

105
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,337
Good! It's not her mistake.
Your mom has brought her up that way.

106
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,501
An old-fashioned granny
in a modern attire!

107
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:38,336
Don't take all that to heart!
You'll end up a loser.

108
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:44,868
What is it saying here?
It says Jessie, right?

109
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,200
You should only hear your heart beat.

110
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,869
Do what it says.
Don't listen to anyone.

111
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,203
Think how you can propose to her.
Focus on the next.

112
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,202
Nothing...what's this get up?

113
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,667
Will you do anything for money?

114
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,268
Don't worry l'll offer you
a good get up in my film.

115
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,668
l'm asking you ignorantly,
you don't think of all this?

116
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:06,834
She finished her Bsc (Maths)
three years ago.

117
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,401
You finished engineering last year

118
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,936
l calculated age,
she is _o years older than you!

119
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:16,668
What are you saying!?
- Yes.

120
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:20,401
She'll not be a day more
than eighteen years.

121
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,201
lf you want calculate.

122
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,336
ls she is older than you by _o years?!
That's awesome!

123
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,836
This is the latest trend.
She will take care of you very well

124
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,401
She will be mom and
wife rolled into one.

125
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,837
She will make all the moves first!
It's good for you also. Got it?

126
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,733
Trust me...

127
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,536
But what if she rejects
citing this as a problem?

128
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:43,602
She will! You have to stand your ground.
Will you?

129
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,400
l don't want it, mom.

130
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,500
Mom, l'm home.

131
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:12,866
Okay.

132
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,667
Brother!

133
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,200
How are you?
- Fine.

134
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,200
What are you doing now?

135
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,601
Do you act in Malayalam films, uncle?

136
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,667
You're handsome.

137
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:28,203
He can't keep anything clean.
His room is untidy.

138
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,668
Karthik...can't you keep
your room a little clean?

139
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,200
Dad saw your room just now.

140
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:37,335
Dad wants to talk to you
in the evening.

141
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,835
He doesn't like your obsession
with cinema.

142
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,337
Mom, l can hear a sweet voice inside,

143
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,834
Anu has brought any friends of her home?

144
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,402
Oh that girl! Jessie from upstairs.

145
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,335
Oh, that girl??

146
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,870
Then one day...suddenly...
Jessie at my place!

147
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:13,733
Come in.

148
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,671
Jessie, this is my brother...
you've never met him, right?

149
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,867
l know...

150
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:24,202
your folks keep calling
your name throughout the day.

151
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,500
Can hear it upstairs.

152
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:33,871
So you too know l am jobless!
- l didn't mean that!

153
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,402
You speak good Telugu.
Aren't you a Malayali?

154
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,169
Yes, but l speak better Telugu
than Malayalam.

155
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,836
How long have you been here?
- Right from my birth.

156
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:50,868
l like Kerala... l visit it often.

157
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:53,735
Especially steam cake and
chickpea curry for breakfast

158
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:57,770
l always hunt for that and eat it.

159
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:01,669
You get more than that in Kerala.
- l know.

160
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:05,334
Your village...
where's your home in Kerala?

161
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:06,333
Alleppey.

162
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,170
My parents are from Alleppey.
Grandmother is there.

163
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,736
l love grandma,
that's why l like Kerala.

164
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,601
Go there once a year...
For her sake.

165
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,601
Did you do MCA after your BSc?

166
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,736
l can never do it.
Isn't Maths difficult?

167
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,736
l like it. If you like math its very easy,
that's the real secret.

168
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,201
You did engineering?

169
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,501
He did but waste.

170
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,869
He just wants to become a filmmaker.
He knows only that.

171
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,266
Filmmaker.

172
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,670
Let's see...not easy...
Easier to pass Math than cinema.

173
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,401
Films are difficult.

174
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,935
l'll definitely become a director!

175
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,168
My dad won't even let us
watch a film!

176
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,401
lt's considered a sin in
our community!

177
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,535
l have seen five films
in my entire life.

178
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,267
That too without my dad's knowledge.

179
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,167
Do you want to leave Karthik?

180
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:13,733
l'll take leave.

181
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,602
She hardly watches films...
my hopes got dashed.

182
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,668
l didn't have heart to leave the room.

183
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,167
What?

184
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,403
l found where she works and
wandered around to see her.

185
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,168
You are not following me?

186
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,167
You are not following me, right?

187
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,734
This is where my office is.

188
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,603
Kebabs are also here!
l love kebabs. That's why l'm here.

189
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,735
l asked just like that.
- What?

190
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,834
Are you saying you will buy for me too?

191
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,667
So what do you do?

192
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,204
l am a program analyst with Wipro.
Joined _o months ago.

193
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,668
Wait a sec!
Let me just look at her.

194
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,334
Okay, tell me,
what do you have?

195
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,402
Any Kerala items like
Malabar fish curry, steamed rice.-

196
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,934
A coconut atleast?

197
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:35,933
On the way to work?

198
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:40,335
No l am going to play cricket...
coming?

199
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:55,501
Why do you keep looking back?

200
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:59,402
lf my dad sees me talking to you,
l am dead meat!

201
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,533
How old are you?

202
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,334
l'm 24. It's okay...

203
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,335
if my dad asks me,
l'll say you're like younger brother to me.

204
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:17,735
What happened?
You forgot something?

205
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:29,869
l don't either, l already have one...
that's enough

206
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:33,535
No...no...l too have
a younger sister.

207
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:38,504
l will accept everyone in this world
as my sister here after except you!

208
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,500
Why?

209
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,734
Felt l had professed
my love too soon.

210
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,270
Wanted to apologise...
but couldn't find her.

211
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:20,866
What?

212
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,502
Your 'love' is not here,
she's in Alleppey.

213
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:27,866
How do you know?

214
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,502
l was talking to her mom.
Saw you going around her house.

215
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:34,668
l saw, don't do it.
Waste of time,

216
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,834
she has gone to visit her granny.
Will be back after a week.

217
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:40,335
Even before my sister finished talking
l knew l would go to Kerala.

218
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,668
Some guys go even to America
for their love,

219
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:59,404
Pleaded with Krishna to accompany me.
He agreed, to sight see Kerala.

220
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,735
Actually he took care of
entire trip expenses.

221
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,102
With what confidence
did we come here?

222
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:21,571
Walking endlessly all over Alleppey and
Kottayam, my knees have worn out!

223
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:26,068
l'm having splitting headache too.
Atleast now call your sister

224
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,768
ask her to find out from
Jessie's mom more details,

225
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:37,775
Find some relevant clue
about their home here.

226
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,436
Have you come with the
idea of sight-seeing Kerala?

227
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,634
l will leave in _o days,
l have a film shoot.

228
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:49,637
But guys like you will definitely win,
you try very hard.

229
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,434
Jessie will be yours.

230
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:05,736
Buddy...get up!
Get up.

231
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,068
What's this torture in the
middle of night?

232
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,634
Not that, a small correction.
Get up l say!

233
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:13,436
A small correction, you said
Iuck favours the brave, right?

234
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,434
Did you wake me to say this?
Both are same.

235
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,633
Not that, get up!

236
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,634
What's today?
- Sunday.

237
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,901
lsn't it? She's a Christian...
she will definitely attend church.

238
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:22,767
There are more churches than
houses here, allow me to sleep.

239
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:26,502
Come...come mad boy!
Come, let's go.- We'll go.

240
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:35,569
Will she come here?
- Come quietly.

241
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,100
Buddy, come here.

242
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,101
How are you so sure
she will come only here?

243
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,901
ls this the only church in this place?

244
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:56,903
l have checked...
this is the biggest church here.

245
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,568
Chances of her coming here is good.

246
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,902
Hey...look...
Oh! That's Jessie!

247
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:07,168
Super! Is she Jessie?

248
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:13,835
Super...buddy!
How did you find her?

249
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,969
l dreamed about...

250
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,767
You are humming the wrong song.

251
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,434
ln the film 'Bombay'
Manisha Koirala is a Muslim.

252
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:24,835
Your heroine is a Christian.
Sing some other song.

253
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:28,769
Love has only one tune.
Music has only one religion.

254
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:30,734
To me only Jessie!

255
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,903
ln exactly ten seconds
she will look at me!

256
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:38,435
This is too much.
- Just wait and watch!

257
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:40,768
Let me see.

258
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,401
Oh God! She saw!

259
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,901
Buddy, l told you.

260
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:02,067
What charm have you spread?

261
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,569
Buddy, she saw us.
- What's that? Love charm?

262
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:08,568
You saw her, right?
Let's go now. Come.

263
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:10,767
Come l say.

264
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:40,102
l was going mad.
Maybe l confessed my love much too fast.

265
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,068
l didn't find you after that
l knew you would be upset.

266
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,902
l came searching for you
just to apologise.

267
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:04,435
Wait... l'll introduce you
as my classmate. Okay?

268
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:15,969
Who is this dear?
- Granny, Karthik, my classmate.

269
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,435
Who is this young big man?

270
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,436
You know enough Malayalam
to be amused?

271
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,735
l'm not his classmate, childhood friend.

272
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,500
Who is this?

273
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:33,067
Karthik, my classmate.

274
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:39,401
Very large herd!

275
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:46,103
Are you both from Hyderabad?

276
00:29:46,966 --> 00:29:49,768
Come home and have lunch.

277
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:51,901
What is he saying?
- Inviting for lunch.

278
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:53,567
Lunch...lunch...

279
00:29:54,433 --> 00:30:00,572
Here only, show them the way.
You come with them, l'll go now, dear.

280
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,168
Come, l'll take care.

281
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:20,433
Lunch?

282
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:24,069
We came to say sorry,
but they are inviting for lunch.

283
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,402
They will, in the name of lunch,
they will stuff you.

284
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,635
Take care of this bald man,
seems to be the main switch!

285
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,167
Are you a Christian?

286
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:46,901
l just asked simply.

287
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:49,502
Many of Jessie's friends
have come here before.

288
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:56,906
Six months ago some
ten to _enty of them came.

289
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,067
What? Twenty guys came before us?

290
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,969
Friends buddy! Keep quiet.

291
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:08,571
Few acres of farm, coconut grove,
fields, got everything here.

292
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:09,900
Nothing in short.

293
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:31,634
Have you come here before?

294
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:37,634
He's asking if you have
come here before.

295
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:48,734
Jessie's classmate?

296
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:52,636
Do you love mathematics that much?
- Very much.

297
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:54,400
Go on ...eat...

298
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:01,768
What's your job?
- Job?

299
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,402
Telugu film hero.
- That's okay.

300
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,634
Eatàeat...

301
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:19,435
Let's escape after having food.

302
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:22,101
Keep quiet.

303
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:23,967
Eat...eat...

304
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,101
Why is biting us, buddy?

305
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,638
There's fish curry, mutton curry,
chicken curry, eat...eat...

306
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:39,834
With what guts you thought
you would find me?

307
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:44,636
l did...didn't l?
But took four days.

308
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:49,169
Why did you come?
- l told you... to apologise.

309
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,170
l thought you were mad.
- Yes, l am angry.

310
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,902
l know...don't take it to heart.

311
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:01,169
Don't stop talking to me for that.

312
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:07,570
Okay, l won't take you and
what you said seriously.

313
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:11,102
That was then, l said that ten days ago,

314
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,434
let me tell you now,

315
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:32,568
ln the city where l lived for 22 years,

316
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:35,435
l am not able to live for
a moment without you!

317
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:41,403
Why? Even he was unable to.
- What did you say? Me too?

318
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:43,833
Only he!

319
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,634
That's why we came here.

320
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,401
Love will end in failure...
do you need that?

321
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,767
However much you get a
good name in my house,

322
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:58,403
they will never accept a Hindu groom.

323
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:02,836
We've to elope, l can't do it.

324
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:07,969
My dad will not like you.
- He won't even talk to me?

325
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:13,070
lf you raise the topic of loving me
or wanting to marry me,

326
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
he'll never talk to you.

327
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,500
There's no way he's going to like you.

328
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:21,069
He will converse well otherwise,
he is a good man.

329
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,171
He will even write his entire property
to you, but not his daughter.

330
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,167
Okay, ask him to write and give.

331
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:39,971
Secondly...l have lived in the
same city for 24 years.

332
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,102
l am _o years older than you!

333
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,901
He will not accept that too.

334
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,101
That's not a big problem nowadays.

335
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,970
lt is very serious problem...
you don't understand!

336
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:00,072
Before all this l should like you...
that's the toughest part!

337
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,634
lt must happen, right?

338
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:08,404
Well said.
Now you are talking sense!

339
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,171
Let's not think of love.
Let's meet whenever we find time.

340
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:34,767
You said friends, right?

341
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,701
How could you come out
of your house now?

342
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,836
That's no problem here.
That's why l love coming here.

343
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,001
No one questions me here.

344
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:06,100
My dad stays only for
a few days and then leaves.

345
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,335
l stay on for 10-15 days.
Whenever l come here.

346
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:12,235
l spent the best part of
my life here only.

347
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:15,169
Dad usually comes back to pick me up.

348
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:18,168
First time, l am travelling back
alone tomorrow in train.

349
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,702
Location is very beautiful,
l'll just go and film video.

350
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,700
Okay, buddy.

351
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,237
No...no...don't go...
my folks will misunderstand.

352
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:30,668
No, l'll come back wherever you go.

353
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:34,903
Buddy, l'll try meeting Mohanlal.
- Okay, carry on.

354
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:39,101
Not yet become one.
- Which college?

355
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,233
Your phone number?

356
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:56,701
Why do you like me?

357
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,236
You said 'l am crazy about you'...
Why?

358
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,101
Do you think l am beautiful?

359
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:10,768
ls it just with the way l look?

360
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:18,770
Can't tell you all that.
You'll know when you see my first film.

361
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:19,900
Watch it to know.

362
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:23,668
lt will be my sixth film.

363
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:34,440
No...you need courage to see a girl
and tell her that you love her.

364
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:38,669
You need perseverance to come
in search of her to another city.

365
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:40,333
You'll get it only if you try...

366
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:46,669
Got linked up with mind, something
happened, it spread a charm,

367
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,235
it brought me here.

368
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,034
You speak very well.

369
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:00,668
The first day l saw you.

370
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:03,335
Cross my heart!
The moon behind faded in its glow!

371
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,668
My heart beat raced up.

372
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:10,902
l even somersaulted on road.
Do you know that?

373
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:15,234
Has no one ever come after you?

374
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:23,038
Guys go overboard even
on average lookers.

375
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,768
May be they haven't seen me
through your eyes!

376
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,235
Glad you understand.
Then, okay.

377
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,368
l am going to use that line
in my film.

378
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:46,168
Hey, it's my copyright.

379
00:38:57,233 --> 00:39:00,035
Good to hear all this Karthik.

380
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:03,168
But don't forget we agreed to be friends.

381
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:09,769
Yeah...friends...
whatever l felt l told you.

382
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,234
l have to go.

383
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:33,234
Come back with me...
Iet's go back together.

384
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:39,771
You shook hands became friends...
Iet this continue in Hyderabad.

385
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:43,835
Friendship should become love
that's all you want, right?

386
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,736
Yeah, but it must happen
in the train tomorrow.- Train?

387
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:45,635
Oh beautiful doll!

388
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:49,903
l forgot to blink my eye watching you...

389
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:56,105
But still the dreams won't stop,
you know?

390
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,568
My vision is your slave...

391
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:08,909
ln you...in me...deep inside
something is warming...

392
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:18,108
Beautiful doll!...

393
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,734
You're the light of my heart...

394
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:55,440
l can't forget you in my life...
The place where you tread...

395
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:59,069
Time is visual treat...
It hit me like waves...

396
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,903
You're the biggest boon to me...

397
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:15,640
Like rain in moonlight,
you came into my life...

398
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:21,972
You've taken over me,
my heart and my soul...

399
00:42:47,166 --> 00:43:09,588
Malayalees sing a lullaby to you
in an emerald decked cradle...

400
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:13,103
My Beloved! It feels so right
to give you my life...

401
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,571
You made me take bath in cold fire...
You gave me happiness...

402
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:28,642
You drowned and fished me out in
the waters of your sweet words...

403
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:34,838
But why did you hide the
shore away from me, my doll?

404
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:17,005
Don't do this...you said friends.
Is this how friends behave?

405
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:18,200
Why did you say that then?

406
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:21,334
How dare you hold my hand?

407
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,300
ln the train!

408
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,969
l kissed you after that
but you didn't stop me.

409
00:46:33,966 --> 00:46:35,534
lsn't this love?

410
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:39,335
l touched your feet...
you didn't stop me.

411
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:41,134
lsn't that love, Jessie?

412
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:47,337
Did you realise the fantastic
chemistry we shared?

413
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:53,966
lt is still there.

414
00:46:58,533 --> 00:47:01,135
l want to sit there with you.

415
00:47:02,966 --> 00:47:04,467
l know you want it too.

416
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:09,468
l thought we could be friends
that's why l said that.

417
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:15,004
Everything got shattered
in the train on seeing you.

418
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,334
There is no love!
There is no chemistry!

419
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:44,634
l don't know why l let you
kiss me.

420
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,535
Let go of me Karthik.
This won't happen.

421
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:51,202
Don't come after me.
l came to tell you this.

422
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,968
l can see only the troubles.
My folks will never accept.

423
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,668
My dad will kill me...
even my mom.

424
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,468
This has already happened
to my sister.

425
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:07,302
She fell in love.
Dad didn't accept

426
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:10,335
Fights and tears everyday at home.
She eloped with him.

427
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:12,201
My dad brought her back
the same evening.

428
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,001
Within a week got her married
to another man.

429
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,468
She has a six month child now.
She's happy now.

430
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,134
My dad made me promise him.

431
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,135
l should marry the guy of his choice.

432
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,201
Problems like this...
- l got you.

433
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,135
l know there are problems.

434
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:30,637
l saw love in your eyes
that night in the train.

435
00:48:30,966 --> 00:48:32,334
That's why l did that.

436
00:48:32,966 --> 00:48:35,301
l kissed you and you didn't stop me.

437
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:37,333
lsn't it love Jessie?

438
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:39,967
l'll leave this place.

439
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,735
l like you.
But l don't want this.

440
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,002
l don't want any trouble,
l don't want this now.

441
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:51,969
Do you understand? Got it?

442
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,538
You are practical...sensible...
that's okay...but don't say 'No'!

443
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,467
You like me, don't you?

444
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:41,067
Don't you feel it?

445
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,068
lt happens only once in a lifetime.

446
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:50,003
lf we can't live with the person
we love what's the use of living.

447
00:49:53,633 --> 00:49:56,635
l'll wage a bet,
your sister cannot be happy

448
00:49:57,066 --> 00:50:00,335
That is...if she truly loved that guy,
l'm sure she'll not be happy now.

449
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:02,668
lt's just an act, is it a life?

450
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:08,969
l didn't do anything wrong.
You are not some one's wife.

451
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,469
You are a Christian dad's daughter,
l am a Hindu dad's son.

452
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:16,068
lf that's what is wrong...
Iet me tell you now.

453
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:21,537
No one can prevent my life with you.
whoever it is...even your dad.

454
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,636
What happened to your love? Happy?
It's raining, l'm hungry.

455
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:44,335
This treat should have been in Taj Banjara,
l'll give it on roadside eatery.

456
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:45,467
Please don't mind it.

457
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:50,070
Did she say only ''l lo''...
not ...''ve you''?

458
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:52,001
You are a genius buddy!

459
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:54,668
She says she likes me
but doesn't want me.

460
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:58,636
Of all the girls in our city
why did l have to fall for Jessie?

461
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,002
She is most beautiful.
She is also most problematic!

462
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:04,335
Forget all that,
is she worth it or not?

463
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:10,004
Can give life for her...my life.
Your life too.- My life?

464
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,402
She used to come as
if nothing had happened.

465
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:24,634
She asked me to come...
l went.

466
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,335
l wondered what she's going
to come up with now?

467
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:35,469
Your office is in Hitech city,
why did you ask me to come here?

468
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:37,201
Someone could see us there.

469
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,002
Let's not stand her and talk.
Shall we go?

470
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,000
Where?

471
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:46,734
Wherever...

472
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,204
How about a movie? 6 pm show...
we can see first half and come away.

473
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:01,069
Home...work...
it has become a routine.

474
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,402
First time l made a trip
to Alleppey alone.

475
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,135
l had to beg my dad for that.

476
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:12,336
l made up my mind
to spend time with you.

477
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,335
l wanted to talk to you.

478
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,002
l said l have work till 8 pm.

479
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,535
l lied.
- What?

480
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:27,634
l lied.

481
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,467
Are you watching the film?

482
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:38,134
Like it?

483
00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:42,134
Or can l talk?
- Like it...

484
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,534
But we can talk.

485
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,668
Let's remain as just friends, Karthik.

486
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:58,069
Otherwise there will be too many problems.
l don't want that.

487
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,537
Nowadays l feel like talking to you,
spending time with you.

488
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:07,200
That's why l am here with you.

489
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,334
l don't want to lose this.

490
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:17,673
lf there's love be_een us...
we can't be free.

491
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,536
lts too much pressure.
What people will think,

492
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:25,002
we'll be worried if someone
is seeing us,

493
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:43,001
l'll go home and tell my dad,

494
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:49,405
Karthik who lives downstairs is my friend
we don't have anything be_een us.

495
00:53:51,066 --> 00:53:53,334
Can l tell him not to worry?

496
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,402
You can come up and
spend time with me in my home.

497
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:08,671
We can be as ourselves.

498
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,139
You are the first guy to kiss me.

499
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,201
l have not dated any guy.

500
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:36,334
l'll walk home from here.

501
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,968
What are you trying to prove, Jessie?

502
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,403
That it's no big deal?

503
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,203
How can l remove my love?
That too for your dad?

504
00:54:51,533 --> 00:54:53,735
Then you talk about your first kiss.

505
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,468
You won't touch me
while riding on the bike,

506
00:54:57,066 --> 00:54:59,334
You think if your hand touched me
l would do something.

507
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,469
When you were in Alleppey,
l wanted to kiss you here.

508
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:12,136
Even if you are 100 feet away
from me l feel like touching you,

509
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,968
it will always be there,

510
00:55:15,133 --> 00:55:17,134
when l am 70, you will be 72,

511
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,001
even then l will feel the same way.

512
00:55:32,066 --> 00:55:33,400
Then, how can we be just friends?

513
00:55:39,066 --> 00:55:40,967
Do you understand
anything l am saying?

514
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,404
You feel like spending time with me,
its only because of love...

515
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,536
Take that love away...
then you won't feel this way.

516
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:57,469
You wanted to go tell your dad
something, what was that?

517
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,303
Karthik living downstairs and l are just
friends, there's nothing be_een us.

518
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:08,637
You should say Karthik loves me,
he wants to spend his life with me,

519
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:09,966
go and tell your dad.

520
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:13,336
Your dad let you go alone
to Alleppey for the first time.

521
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:15,967
He's not the same Joseph
he was in your sister's time.

522
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:18,134
l think he has changed...
he'll accept me.

523
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,535
We'll not have any problem.
Go and tell him.

524
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:31,200
She walks away,

525
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:34,669
lf she doesn't like some thing
she walks away immediately.

526
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:38,669
l have seen more of her back
than her front!

527
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:42,969
Not that l was complaining
Why are you torturing me, Jessie?

528
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,133
l got this feeling.

529
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:07,603
My love for you is
as vast as the sky...

530
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:10,969
lt wants to share joy with you only...

531
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:13,634
Don't cite silly reasons...
Don't care about this world...

532
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:17,835
Where's the book that says
love is sin?

533
00:57:18,366 --> 00:57:21,635
There's no law that says
Iove is crime...

534
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:25,269
Once fallen in love,
heart won't accept friendship...

535
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,636
Time never moves backwards...

536
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:35,839
Don't torture me saying
l'm your friend...

537
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:43,507
Why don't you think me as your love?

538
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:41,303
What life says...if you hear it...

539
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,936
Won't you understand eveything?

540
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:51,973
Though you like me,
will you cheat yourself?

541
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:58,972
You were silent
when l kissed you...

542
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:06,272
You ask me to stand away
scuttling my

543
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:39,469
Yesterday my brother saw you
talking to me near my office.

544
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:42,068
l'm telling you,
it will be a disaster.

545
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,137
l am following you for a month
singing songs.

546
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,401
Telling you one thing only.

547
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:50,400
You are ignoring me.

548
01:01:01,066 --> 01:01:02,634
l'm on terrace.

549
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,735
l think it's going to rain,
shall l get the clothes?

550
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,668
Okay, no...no...l'm going out.
- Go away.

551
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:10,067
Has father come back?

552
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:12,667
Okay, l'll come.

553
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:16,301
Want me to come down?
Coming...coming...

554
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:18,967
Nothing like that.

555
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:20,467
Come here.

556
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:23,301
Hang up, l'm coming.

557
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,468
Saw you yesterday
in front of her office,

558
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,201
Today you are holding
her hand on the terrace.

559
01:01:32,466 --> 01:01:35,402
You think l am dumb?
- Nothing like that.

560
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,401
l will break your face to pieces.

561
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:43,403
l hardly get angry.
He is Jessie's brother.

562
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,134
Actually l shouldn't get mad with him.

563
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:48,201
But the word he flung at me.

564
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,537
Then l thought to myself...
l love only Jessie... not him!

565
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:53,967
Bloody!

566
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:01,634
How dare you hit me?

567
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,202
Jerry, listen to me.

568
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:10,202
l'm telling you to stop it.
- How dare you hit me?

569
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,335
l told you many things about me.

570
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,968
He used foul language.

571
01:02:20,133 --> 01:02:23,336
l'll kill him.
- Okay, go ahead.

572
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:25,334
But l didn't tell you one thing.

573
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,634
Okay.

574
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:29,669
You'll pay for it dearly.
You'll get a spanking from me.

575
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,135
You don't know about me.
- l'm coming down.- l'll show him what l'm.

576
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,672
lf you'd noticed the way l hit Jerry,
you will see a boxer's style!

577
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:39,667
Yeah, l am a boxer.

578
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:43,969
ln school l learnt boxing along
with cricket and football.

579
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:46,468
My coach called me as 'light foot'.

580
01:02:46,633 --> 01:02:48,968
Now you'll see why.

581
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:54,471
Come...come...will you hit me?
This is for hitting me.

582
01:02:55,066 --> 01:02:59,970
Fall at my feet, otherwise you will
get smashed by everyone here.

583
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:01,200
You'll never get up.

584
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:06,201
Jerry, let me close the shutter.
We'll take on him then.

585
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,303
Wait, you're not that worth.
Don't get excited, come here.

586
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:14,968
lf you had called me
l would have come.

587
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:16,467
why unnecessarily bring
all your friends?

588
01:03:17,533 --> 01:03:20,202
l shouldn't have hit you.
What happened yesterday was wrong.

589
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,336
And there's nothing be_een Jessie
and me the way you think.

590
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:26,667
Say sorry!

591
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:39,202
l think l'm doing wrong,
but still don't mind.

592
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:49,470
Are you a boxer?
Hit me...hit me...

593
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:04,300
Come.

594
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:19,000
Don't...

595
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,067
Hi dad!

596
01:04:56,333 --> 01:05:00,136
Did you hit Jerry?
What's the problem with him?

597
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:02,068
His dad came and yelled at me.

598
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,135
Why do you put me in such a spot?

599
01:05:04,733 --> 01:05:07,302
His dad will ask us now to vacate.

600
01:05:08,133 --> 01:05:12,203
You won't be there to help me
house-hunt.

601
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,200
Why did you hit him?

602
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,003
l didn't hit him, dad.
He brought some guys to hit me.

603
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:20,201
You want me to get hit
and keep quiet? Move dad.

604
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,534
Did he bring friends to hit you?

605
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:25,469
He came down and yelled
as if you were to blame.

606
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:32,005
Did you try anything with Jessie?

607
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:37,471
Should we've to discuss it here?
Let's go in. Come in mom...dad.

608
01:05:38,066 --> 01:05:41,969
Dad got angry because
Joseph abused him.

609
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:46,203
You said he hit you but
it is Jerry's face that is bruised!

610
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,334
Karthik, tell me the truth.

611
01:05:47,533 --> 01:05:49,668
Nothing mom,
l was talking to her generally.

612
01:05:50,066 --> 01:05:52,535
Her brother made
a big issue out of it.

613
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,668
He tried to get my girl.
Wastrel!

614
01:05:58,066 --> 01:05:59,133
Won't her brother get angry?

615
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,669
lf my son comes after your daughter...
won't you get mad?

616
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:04,635
Does that justify ganging up to hit him?
Will you bring goons?

617
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,668
l should be the one to
give a police complaint!

618
01:06:07,066 --> 01:06:08,534
Your son must go to jail.

619
01:06:08,733 --> 01:06:12,136
Your son is the rascal not mine!
Why would try your daughter?

620
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,200
You think my son is jobless?

621
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,336
Complaint to police?
Go ahead, we'll see what happens.

622
01:06:16,533 --> 01:06:20,637
l know he is jobless...
trying to be a director?

623
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
ls that a profession?

624
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:24,635
He needs to be properly qualified
to marry my daughter.

625
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:29,535
Your daughter parks herself
like a car in my house.

626
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:30,467
and you want a qualification?

627
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:32,534
Ask her...she would have
said some thing.

628
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:34,201
My son didn't go up
to your house.

629
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,537
Your daughter is the one always
in our house.- l know about my daughter.

630
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:41,669
l will book him on eve teasing charges...
he will get thrashed properly.

631
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:45,736
Let the court decide who is wrong.
- Father, please...

632
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:50,536
l'll not get mowed
by your threats.

633
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:54,670
This is my house...- Please go, dad.
- You vacate immediately.

634
01:06:55,066 --> 01:06:56,400
l've paid 4 months advance.

635
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:00,202
l should be given 3 months notice.

636
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,735
l will go to consumer court.

637
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:09,138
l thought it's all over...
but she said it's over really.

638
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,534
l thought you loved me?!

639
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,635
How can you hit your
Ioved one's brother?

640
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:25,201
How can you fight with him?

641
01:07:27,633 --> 01:07:30,535
Or did you listen to what l said and
now you've stopped loving me?

642
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,201
And so you went and hit him
with that frustration?

643
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:36,967
You think l should have taken
the beating for your sake?

644
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,670
You want me to grovel at his feet?
l can't.

645
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,668
You know how much
l love you, Jessie.

646
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:49,634
They are arranging my marriage.

647
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,467
Because of this trouble?

648
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:56,669
They had planned it already,
fixed the date now.

649
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,468
Did you know that when we
were on the train?

650
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,404
No...the day l met you here...
told you l like you...

651
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:13,737
That morning dad talked to me.
Today morning he confirmed it.

652
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,200
They told me.

653
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:18,068
l knew this would happen.

654
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:24,638
But l thought l could somehow
convince them about you.

655
01:08:27,966 --> 01:08:35,206
But now after this fight l don't know
what to talk about you and how?

656
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:36,533
No other way.

657
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:43,334
Next month 23rd is the
wedding in Kerala.

658
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:45,968
ln the same church
where you met me.

659
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:56,201
What do you want me to do, Karthik?

660
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,667
Go get married, Jessie!

661
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:01,534
You didn't come to ask
my permission.

662
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:06,971
You just wanted to inform me, right?
You have told me...go...and marry.

663
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:49,671
l saw her just once after that.
She smiled...

664
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,534
lt was poetic...

665
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,067
And made me mad too.

666
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:03,335
And then they all left for the wedding
_o weeks earlier.

667
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,667
Needless to say we weren't invited.

668
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,467
l want to go for her wedding.

669
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:27,205
What? To Kerala? Big men in
colored lungis will beat you to pulp.

670
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:29,668
They will cut you into pieces.

671
01:10:30,066 --> 01:10:34,003
We can't even enter the premises.
- l have to go buddy.

672
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,203
You insist on going,
give me one good reason, why?

673
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:44,636
l love her, buddy.
l have to see her face.

674
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,134
l have to go for her wedding!

675
01:10:46,466 --> 01:10:49,268
Church wedding climax
comes in many films.

676
01:10:49,466 --> 01:10:52,468
Church wedding climax now
in your life also.

677
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:56,236
Do you need to be there personally?
My left eye is batting rapidly.

678
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,735
Do you know those people?

679
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:01,602
Baldie has seen us.

680
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,235
Food...food...

681
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,736
Please come in...
Jessie's classmates are inside.

682
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:14,600
Come.

683
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:18,603
After marriage,
please enjoy the feast and go.

684
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:20,267
We will have.

685
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,601
He's too...
- Got caught.

686
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,935
Why is everyone looking
at us strangely?

687
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,734
Please come in, uncle.

688
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,403
Jerry is here, be careful.
- You be careful.

689
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:36,566
He doesn't know me.

690
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,402
Do we need to go through all this?

691
01:11:57,333 --> 01:12:03,472
Of all the women in the world
why did l fall in love with Jessie?

692
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,803
However many times you ask me,
l have no answer to that.

693
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:22,901
Shall l go and talk to her?
- Not now.

694
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:32,469
Sit.

695
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,334
Get up!

696
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:52,336
Even now we can leave...
Iet's go.

697
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,736
Buddy, she is very happy.
Shall we go now?

698
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,469
l told you this right then.
Did you listen to me?

699
01:13:12,233 --> 01:13:13,734
l knew you would get affected.

700
01:13:14,233 --> 01:13:15,901
lfwe get up and go
everyone will see us.

701
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:24,736
Did they ask her if she is willing?
They'll ask her first, right?

702
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:28,602
Haven't you watched films?
They will ask the groom first.

703
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:33,333
What?

704
01:13:34,266 --> 01:13:35,400
l have seen it in the movies.

705
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,735
They will ask the crowd
if there's any objection.

706
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:40,902
Shall l raise my hand and object?

707
01:13:41,233 --> 01:13:43,602
Raise objection?
With so much crowd here?

708
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,234
No way, if he sees us,
we are dead.

709
01:13:45,466 --> 01:13:55,742
Roy Thomas, do you willingly, whole heartedly
take Jessie as your lawfully wedded wife?

710
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:56,800
l do.

711
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:09,612
Jessie, do you willingly, whole heartedly take
Roy Thomas as your lawfully wedded husband?

712
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,603
l want to talk to you...
l don't want to get married.

713
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,668
l don't want this marriage as of now.

714
01:14:22,933 --> 01:14:24,401
Do you know what's happening there?

715
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,468
She said she doesn't want this
alliance and stopped the wedding.

716
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:27,733
What are you saying, buddy?

717
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:31,602
Please make my dad understand.
Forgive me for it.

718
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,734
Jessie, what are you saying?

719
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,605
ls there someone else?
- Dad, please! There's no one.

720
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:57,934
What?
- She has seen us!

721
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,903
There is someone...
that's why she is like this!

722
01:15:02,233 --> 01:15:04,668
Why are you doing this
after coming so far?

723
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,401
Jessie, please listen to me.

724
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,736
Even if there is...
you won't approve.

725
01:15:10,899 --> 01:15:12,401
This isn't why l called off the wedding.

726
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,236
First she said no, then said even
if there's one you'll not approve,

727
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:18,602
lf she points a finger at you,
that's it!

728
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,902
We are in big trouble,
Iet's go buddy.

729
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:24,469
No problem, nothing will happen, l'll take care.
- You will be fine, l have a problem.

730
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:27,235
Please dad, l want to go home now.

731
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:30,603
Wait! You know what you are
getting us into?

732
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,269
You must come home and
have dinner with us.

733
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,602
lt's my treat for getting
a 'first class' in MCA.

734
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:41,570
Come, let's also join.
- My dear! l'm not hungry.

735
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:51,566
Jessie is mine.

736
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,468
There was only one thought
in my head.

737
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:55,734
And she is worth dying for!

738
01:16:14,566 --> 01:16:16,734
Look at the old lady,
how she's creating a scene.

739
01:16:16,899 --> 01:16:21,904
They are hitting each other.
It's risky to be here, let's go.

740
01:16:22,233 --> 01:16:25,235
Now, do you know why l insisted
on coming here?- Okay, come.

741
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,802
l could see her face. Did you see the happiness
on her face when she saw me?

742
01:16:32,566 --> 01:16:33,266
But l saw our future,

743
01:16:33,466 --> 01:16:36,602
lf she had said there's a guy,
if she had pointed her finger at us,

744
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,401
we would be dead by now.

745
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:41,802
Now l know why Jessie refused.

746
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:44,602
But to say it here, now,
you need real guts!

747
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,902
She has captured a place
in my heart.

748
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,235
Don't know where my life
is leading me to?

749
01:16:51,933 --> 01:16:54,935
Are you saying crossroads of life?
Good philosophy.

750
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:56,801
You will find a solution.

751
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,740
lf we straight, a vehicle will come,
a little further up, we'll get a road.

752
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:06,802
Didn't l say about a vehicle coming?
Bus has come.

753
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:09,601
Let's get into this bus...
- Are you sure?

754
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,936
Your life is about to change.
Come...

755
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:15,401
Get it...get in l say.

756
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,735
Looks like the same church.

757
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,602
Not looks like...
it is the same church, buddy.

758
01:17:31,466 --> 01:17:34,402
Her brother has spotted us.
- He won't, bus is on move.

759
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,934
Come fast!

760
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,401
He won't.
- He is coming after us.

761
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:44,936
Go fast and stop that bus.
Go fast!

762
01:17:45,233 --> 01:17:46,467
They are coming after us.

763
01:17:46,899 --> 01:17:52,272
You were the one who said
l'll find a new path,

764
01:17:52,466 --> 01:17:54,267
lt's all messed up,

765
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:57,001
l didn't think your path will
change so soon.

766
01:17:58,466 --> 01:17:59,466
Stop the bus.

767
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,403
They will blame us for
the marriage cancellation.

768
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,936
She didn't even know our plans.
It's all gone haywire.

769
01:18:07,899 --> 01:18:09,601
Go fast....go fast...

770
01:18:09,899 --> 01:18:11,901
Let them come, l'll say
l'm big hero, they'll go away.

771
01:18:12,266 --> 01:18:13,667
They will smash us...
not let us off.

772
01:18:14,233 --> 01:18:14,900
Go fast.

773
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,668
Stop the bus!...

774
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,468
Buddy, operation showdown.
- Okay.

775
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:22,733
Why did you come here?

776
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:24,467
lsn't he Jessie's classmate?

777
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:25,900
He had come home for lunch,
the last time Jessie was here.

778
01:18:26,233 --> 01:18:27,233
They were there in the church.

779
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:29,268
Did you come to stop the marriage?
Get down.

780
01:18:29,466 --> 01:18:33,736
What man?- Why should we get down?
- You keep quiet please.

781
01:18:35,466 --> 01:18:38,335
Why should we get down?
What have we done?

782
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:44,737
Buddy, you stay there,
don't rush, l'll deal it. Trust me.

783
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:57,901
Buddy, he hit me!

784
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:02,604
Hit your 'brother-in-law'...he hit me.
If you can't l'll hit him.

785
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,233
Why did you hit him?

786
01:19:04,566 --> 01:19:05,600
What's the trouble there?

787
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,336
lf my family comes to know,
entire area will go.

788
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:11,401
Stop...

789
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,568
They came from Hyderabad and
created ruckus in church.- Police!

790
01:19:16,566 --> 01:19:17,900
What's the trouble here?
Who are they?

791
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:19,934
They hit Sunny.
They hit us sir.

792
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,801
That guy hit us sir.

793
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,234
Come with me.
- What's this trouble, buddy?

794
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,137
Of all the girls in the world
why did you fall in love with Jessie?

795
01:19:39,366 --> 01:19:41,401
That's exactly what l'm also thinking.

796
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:47,937
You said you will give your life...
Iooks like it's going to happen.

797
01:19:49,133 --> 01:19:54,071
Anyway one day we all have to die.
She is worth it, buddy!

798
01:19:54,266 --> 01:19:59,371
Oh my God!
You will say anything.

799
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:06,273
Two things l hate in this world...
hospital and police station.

800
01:20:06,466 --> 01:20:08,701
Now l'm in police station
because of you.

801
01:20:08,866 --> 01:20:12,803
Your brother-in-law's punches
will anyway take me to a hospital.

802
01:20:13,133 --> 01:20:16,736
How hurt my fans will feel
on knowing this?

803
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:21,069
Her wedding has been
called off, buddy!

804
01:20:21,266 --> 01:20:23,368
Oh God! Is it time to feel happy?

805
01:20:32,466 --> 01:20:35,869
There isn't anyone else...
it was a lie what l said in the church.

806
01:20:39,933 --> 01:20:43,936
Why did you come to the church, Karthik?
Was it for me?

807
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:54,135
Am l the problem now?

808
01:20:54,699 --> 01:20:56,868
lf l decide something
it's a problem for you, right?

809
01:20:57,033 --> 01:21:02,371
Then why am l here...
you decide whatever you want.

810
01:21:04,933 --> 01:21:06,934
Dad! They are here.
- Who?

811
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:09,935
Karthik and his friend.
He has come here before also.

812
01:21:20,733 --> 01:21:23,202
They might have planned to elope...
l think like that.

813
01:21:23,366 --> 01:21:24,200
Where are they now?

814
01:21:25,699 --> 01:21:27,368
l have booked them under
a false complaint of hitting Sunny.

815
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,401
Why a false complaint of
hitting cousin Sunny?

816
01:21:30,366 --> 01:21:31,366
What is this?

817
01:21:32,466 --> 01:21:34,134
ls Karthik in the police station?

818
01:21:35,133 --> 01:21:37,201
Have you ever understood me, Jerry?

819
01:21:38,033 --> 01:21:41,136
lf l had wanted to elope,
l would have done it long ago.

820
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,736
There's no connection be_een me stopping
the wedding and Karthik being there.

821
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:48,135
l didn't even know he was there.
l saw him only when l was walking out.

822
01:21:48,933 --> 01:21:50,801
Dad, please bring him out of
the police station immediately.

823
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,935
Why Karthik has been arrested, mom?
What did Karthik do?

824
01:21:55,133 --> 01:21:59,871
So you are fond of him! l thought
he was the one angling for you.

825
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:04,935
Roy Thomas is vice president
of Future Line in San Francisco

826
01:22:05,699 --> 01:22:08,202
Who is he? A film director!
Is that a job to be proud of?

827
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:11,269
What future prospects does that have?
Moreover a Hindu!

828
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,703
l might eat in their house but
my daughter will marry only to a Christian.

829
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:18,934
Don't you remember
what happened to your sister?- Dad!

830
01:22:22,133 --> 01:22:26,470
l promise l won't see him
or talk to him.

831
01:22:26,866 --> 01:22:28,701
Just get him out, that's enough.

832
01:22:31,933 --> 01:22:36,270
She promised not to see him again.
Let's end this here.

833
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,801
Bring him out and let him off.

834
01:22:42,266 --> 01:22:42,866
Buddy, look!

835
01:22:43,033 --> 01:22:44,200
Please come in sir,
take your seat sir.

836
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:49,470
Both sides have hit each other.
l am just taking their statement.

837
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:52,268
No need of it.
There's fault on our side also.

838
01:22:53,066 --> 01:22:55,368
Let them off.
You don't have to write a case.

839
01:22:55,699 --> 01:22:56,934
Are you sure?
- Sure.

840
01:22:58,466 --> 01:23:00,401
You both can go!
- Thank you sir.

841
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,702
When they were travelling in bus,
our boys stopped the bus,

842
01:23:03,933 --> 01:23:04,933
Jerry and others hit them.
- Come...

843
01:23:05,133 --> 01:23:08,736
They have come from Hyderabad.
- Why are you staring at him?

844
01:23:08,933 --> 01:23:11,735
We have come to an unknown place,
l can get my fans agitate.

845
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:14,268
Let's just leave.
Okay.

846
01:23:16,133 --> 01:23:17,934
Why is he calling again?

847
01:23:18,133 --> 01:23:21,035
You manage him, whatsoever,
he's your father-in-law.

848
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:25,201
Please don't disturb us

849
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:29,937
She has promised not to talk
to you or see you.

850
01:23:30,133 --> 01:23:32,201
That's why l agreed to let you out.

851
01:23:32,366 --> 01:23:38,371
Otherwise you will be sitting
inside for a week.- Got it?

852
01:23:39,266 --> 01:23:42,068
lf you have any idea of running
behind her...forget it.

853
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:46,369
Atleast from now, be careful.

854
01:23:46,933 --> 01:23:49,268
l will take care sir.
Come, buddy.

855
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:56,272
Go back home in one piece.
We are on it, sir. Go away!

856
01:23:56,466 --> 01:23:59,702
We are on it, sir.
- Get lost!

857
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:01,934
lf everything becomes okay one day,

858
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:03,934
that old man will become
your father-in-law,

859
01:24:04,133 --> 01:24:05,734
how will you talk to this man?

860
01:24:05,933 --> 01:24:07,734
How will you talk to her brother?

861
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:11,035
How can you be friendly after all this?

862
01:24:11,733 --> 01:24:12,934
l don't think so.

863
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:20,937
Let's see when it happens.
l have to see her once.

864
01:24:21,133 --> 01:24:23,869
What? Have you gone mad?
Police station is better.

865
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:25,768
Buddy, please...
- l don't want to die here.

866
01:24:27,033 --> 01:24:29,935
l know that girl is your life.

867
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:33,369
What a dialogue!
- What is he saying?

868
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,868
He is saying she is my life.

869
01:24:36,033 --> 01:24:38,201
What a dialogue!
- How does he know that?

870
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:40,034
Even he knows!

871
01:24:45,133 --> 01:24:47,735
lf you get caught, don't betray me.

872
01:24:47,933 --> 01:24:51,069
What's this guy talking about?
Let's go back.

873
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:53,735
Wait, l'll be back in minutes.
- Go carefully.

874
01:24:54,933 --> 01:24:57,702
l have to see you, Karthik.
l have to talk to you.

875
01:24:58,133 --> 01:25:00,201
Just once...now!

876
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,071
Then l won't see you or talk to you
like l promised dad.

877
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:07,801
Where are you Karthik?

878
01:25:21,266 --> 01:25:23,134
You look beautiful in your
wedding sari!

879
01:25:28,266 --> 01:25:30,935
l was just thinking of you
and you are here.

880
01:25:36,266 --> 01:25:37,200
What if someone sees us?

881
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:41,470
l can't even imagine the consequences.
l have seen you...go!

882
01:25:45,066 --> 01:25:46,133
Please come out.

883
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:18,069
l have promised not to see you
or talk to you.

884
01:26:21,399 --> 01:26:23,401
Promises are meant to be broken.

885
01:26:27,466 --> 01:26:28,800
Thanks for breaking off the wedding.

886
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:31,135
You need guts for that.

887
01:26:32,133 --> 01:26:35,703
Why before such a large gathering?

888
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:38,700
Jessie, you didn't like the guy?

889
01:26:38,933 --> 01:26:40,467
l love you, Karthik.

890
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:05,367
You realised it only in the church?

891
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,868
You don't go to church in Hyderabad?

892
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,268
Did l torture you too much?

893
01:27:13,266 --> 01:27:14,934
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

894
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:16,868
When did you feel it?

895
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:20,201
l liked you the moment
l set eyes on you.

896
01:27:21,933 --> 01:27:23,734
When you saw me near the gate,

897
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,935
each time l saw something
in your eyes.

898
01:27:28,066 --> 01:27:32,203
When l saw you in the terrace
l wanted to touch your face.

899
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:36,135
When you proposed to me,
walking by my side on the road,

900
01:27:39,133 --> 01:27:41,268
l thought you found out,

901
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:46,068
When you apologised to me here,

902
01:27:53,366 --> 01:27:56,869
When you wrote 'Friends' in the train,

903
01:27:57,266 --> 01:27:59,067
my heart pounded louder
than the train!

904
01:28:04,133 --> 01:28:05,367
That's why l didn't stop you.

905
01:28:06,133 --> 01:28:07,734
That's why l kissed you.

906
01:28:14,366 --> 01:28:15,133
Enough!

907
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:22,269
Don't be here...go home.

908
01:28:22,466 --> 01:28:24,367
l told you this would happen.

909
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:30,135
l was fearing for this only.
It's all because of me.

910
01:28:36,133 --> 01:28:41,037
Come with me...
l'll take care of everything.

911
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,200
Dad has to say 'yes'

912
01:29:17,933 --> 01:29:22,804
Do you understand?
l can't otherwise.

913
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,802
l just don't know why he is
so stubborn...only in this.

914
01:29:27,466 --> 01:29:28,466
He is a good man.

915
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:35,136
He has to accept...
l can easily leave all this behind.

916
01:29:36,033 --> 01:29:36,700
lt's true.

917
01:29:37,699 --> 01:29:41,070
But everyone should be happy...
Isn't that what you also want?

918
01:29:44,366 --> 01:29:48,069
l'll take care of it.
l'll convince my dad.

919
01:29:50,133 --> 01:29:52,935
l don't know how...
but l will convince him.

920
01:29:53,133 --> 01:30:01,407
l will come... for you!
- You will come for me?

921
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:08,702
You are saying what l should
be saying.

922
01:30:20,699 --> 01:30:21,567
Karthik, go!

923
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:33,038
My heart utters your name only...

924
01:30:34,033 --> 01:30:40,506
Stopped it on the tip of my lips...

925
01:30:40,666 --> 01:30:50,242
l arrested your heart with my silence...

926
01:30:50,433 --> 01:30:53,235
Please forgive me, my dear...

927
01:31:07,566 --> 01:31:12,671
Chasing boon...
Touching rhythm...

928
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:19,573
l'm saying my life is yours...

929
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:24,337
Are you listening?

930
01:31:52,433 --> 01:32:01,241
l heard...thousands of Veenas playing
rhythms of happiness in my heart...

931
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:06,504
first time in the words you say...

932
01:32:06,699 --> 01:32:12,372
l heard the thrill of classic music...

933
01:32:12,566 --> 01:32:18,171
That's enough, my love...

934
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:33,114
l heard you say l love you
while l'm still alive...

935
01:32:57,233 --> 01:33:07,042
Don't know what will
happen in future?

936
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:17,676
Whatever may happen,
you take care of it...

937
01:33:18,566 --> 01:33:28,509
l'll never leave you,
are you listening, my dear?

938
01:33:28,666 --> 01:33:38,675
l was floating like a piece
ofwhite paper in air...

939
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,704
You stopped it and
wrote on it...

940
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:49,004
l'm listening to those songs only...

941
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:21,675
First time an experience of bliss...

942
01:34:23,233 --> 01:34:33,509
A boon that lets' you experience
the bliss for the first time...

943
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:38,337
lt is older that sky...

944
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:43,671
lt existed before earth
came into existence...

945
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,038
lt was born with time
and became part of it...

946
01:34:49,233 --> 01:34:54,037
lt is heartless love...

947
01:34:55,166 --> 01:35:05,242
Come, l'll hide you
in my embrace...

948
01:35:05,433 --> 01:35:15,176
l'll become yours and
part of you...

949
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:21,238
ln places where nobody ever met...

950
01:35:21,433 --> 01:35:26,504
ln times where nobody
thinks of anyone...

951
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,268
Here's your key, bye.

952
01:37:04,133 --> 01:37:06,802
You direct the van,
we'll follow you.

953
01:37:10,133 --> 01:37:11,734
What Karthik? First day?

954
01:37:11,899 --> 01:37:13,801
Don't take for granted
l'll teach you something here,

955
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,902
nobody teaches you anything here,
we've to learn ourselves.

956
01:37:17,133 --> 01:37:20,135
You'll work with other
assistant directors, you'll get it.

957
01:37:27,666 --> 01:37:30,268
l'm in love with your sister
for the past 2 years.

958
01:37:48,133 --> 01:37:56,074
l don't want Krishnudu
to misunderstand me.

959
01:37:56,233 --> 01:37:59,936
He knows you are an angel...
l do too.

960
01:38:00,233 --> 01:38:02,001
Have we ever come here before?

961
01:38:02,233 --> 01:38:04,668
l asked him and
he said no problem.

962
01:38:05,133 --> 01:38:06,801
lnfact he scolded me
for asking him.

963
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,269
What's bothering you, Jessie?
- l have been lying too much at home.

964
01:38:19,133 --> 01:38:20,601
l don't like it.

965
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:27,936
What if my dad never agrees?
How long will you wait?

966
01:38:30,899 --> 01:38:32,601
Do l really have to answer this?

967
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,935
l know you'll say however long.

968
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,935
lt's not you...it's me!

969
01:38:39,733 --> 01:38:41,801
l never thought
l would love you this much.

970
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,134
l can't be without you for too long.

971
01:38:47,566 --> 01:38:49,567
l heard something
which you said, right?

972
01:38:54,933 --> 01:38:58,136
No lies...must feel at ease.

973
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,935
Shouldn't be worried
if someone sees us.

974
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:10,670
lf l can't be that way
l don't want anything.

975
01:39:11,899 --> 01:39:15,603
Convince your dad...
l will show you how to live.

976
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:21,934
lsn't that the real problem?!

977
01:39:22,133 --> 01:39:26,937
Come like my breath and
music of my life...

978
01:39:27,133 --> 01:39:36,141
Come like light in my life...

979
01:39:41,733 --> 01:39:45,136
Come like dream come true...

980
01:39:45,733 --> 01:39:51,004
Come like the steps l take...

981
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:57,906
Join me and walk with me...

982
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,268
Feel like being like this always.

983
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,802
How will you make films then?
- l will make.

984
01:40:09,233 --> 01:40:12,803
l could get your love,
can't l make films?

985
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:17,136
lf everything goes well as l plan,
l'll definitely make films.

986
01:40:18,933 --> 01:40:19,933
Your film's dialogue?

987
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:23,901
Sounds good, right?

988
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:31,738
Why is today so special?
- Maybe this is the last time.

989
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:38,933
Why did you say that?

990
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,134
Felt like saying it.

991
01:40:43,899 --> 01:40:45,735
You are off to Goa for film shoot.

992
01:40:45,899 --> 01:40:50,571
45 days, you'll be there and
l'll be here, separately.

993
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,935
May be that's why.

994
01:41:00,233 --> 01:41:01,801
May be that's why l love you.

995
01:42:14,066 --> 01:42:25,410
My heart loves you and
it's singing like birds of spring...

996
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:36,544
lt's watching me with pity
silenced by the summer...

997
01:42:36,699 --> 01:42:47,710
Don't know where's that
sprouting moment is hiding?

998
01:43:54,533 --> 01:43:57,335
l like the location,
l'll come little late tomorrow,

999
01:43:57,533 --> 01:44:00,102
Karthik...stand there.
Little that side.

1000
01:44:00,533 --> 01:44:02,268
Little this side.

1001
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:03,133
You're the hero,

1002
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:05,334
he's separated from the heroine
for nearly 45 days,

1003
01:44:05,533 --> 01:44:07,801
you be in that feeling,
place camera low,

1004
01:44:08,199 --> 01:44:09,801
zoom in slowly.

1005
01:44:36,866 --> 01:44:38,601
What are you so pre-occupied with?
- Nothing sir..

1006
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,468
Looks like busy with SMS's.

1007
01:44:42,199 --> 01:44:46,804
lf you don't concentrate here,
it's like a slap on my face.

1008
01:44:52,766 --> 01:44:55,602
What a lousy place!
No ne_ork in mid town too.

1009
01:45:03,333 --> 01:45:04,667
Roy, you've come early.

1010
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:06,667
You said you'll be here by 12.30.

1011
01:45:07,766 --> 01:45:08,766
Okay, come in.

1012
01:46:13,266 --> 01:46:13,599
What's it, Jessie?

1013
01:46:13,766 --> 01:46:15,334
No need of this scene today,
film it on some other day.

1014
01:46:15,533 --> 01:46:16,800
lt's nice, very important scene, sir.

1015
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:20,336
l know it is important but clichTd
which father has supported love.

1016
01:46:20,866 --> 01:46:22,534
if he did he won't be accepted
by the audience,

1017
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:24,801
otherwise the father will threaten
to commit suicide,

1018
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:26,134
how many films will have
the same dialogue?

1019
01:46:26,333 --> 01:46:27,600
Let's think of something new.

1020
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:37,135
Let's end this topic right now.

1021
01:46:37,466 --> 01:46:39,334
Jessie, look...

1022
01:46:45,266 --> 01:46:47,334
Let's fix marriage
after 5 or 6 months.

1023
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:21,268
Phone call, Karthik?
- No problem sir.

1024
01:47:24,666 --> 01:47:27,201
Director will get angry.

1025
01:47:28,333 --> 01:47:29,767
Director is taking it serious.

1026
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,668
Finish your call...switch off
the camera, we'll shoot later.

1027
01:47:31,866 --> 01:47:33,467
l'll switch it off.
- Go ahead, talk.

1028
01:47:33,666 --> 01:47:35,334
l'm in good mood,
Iet's go for take.

1029
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:37,801
Are you supporting your friend?

1030
01:47:39,533 --> 01:47:40,800
You could've done it early, right?

1031
01:48:09,333 --> 01:48:13,336
Karthik...why didn't you call?
Not even a single SMS?

1032
01:48:14,866 --> 01:48:16,100
Jessie, l was...

1033
01:48:21,533 --> 01:48:23,668
l didn't get anything
from you after that.

1034
01:48:24,199 --> 01:48:29,471
l thought it may become problem,
so l didn't call you back.

1035
01:48:29,666 --> 01:48:31,334
l sent an SMS,

1036
01:48:33,666 --> 01:48:35,601
you didn't reply to it also.

1037
01:48:40,333 --> 01:48:45,137
Too many problems here...
l'll come there.

1038
01:48:48,333 --> 01:48:50,468
What are you saying?
What happened?

1039
01:48:50,766 --> 01:48:52,100
Same thing...again.

1040
01:48:53,666 --> 01:48:54,800
You will only get irritated if l tell you.

1041
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:56,134
You will get angry.

1042
01:48:56,866 --> 01:48:58,767
l've decided l can't be here.

1043
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:04,269
Tell me where...l'll come now.

1044
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:07,668
Didn't l tell you l will come for you?

1045
01:49:10,133 --> 01:49:11,667
Jessie, l am in Goa.

1046
01:49:12,666 --> 01:49:15,268
lt'll take five hours drive to reach city.

1047
01:49:15,433 --> 01:49:16,267
How will you come here?

1048
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:21,100
Are you telling me not to come?

1049
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:28,772
l'm not saying don't come...
but not now.

1050
01:49:29,666 --> 01:49:33,469
Alone, so far...
There's nothing proper here.

1051
01:49:33,766 --> 01:49:34,533
You can't stay here.

1052
01:49:37,333 --> 01:49:39,268
Listen to me.

1053
01:49:42,866 --> 01:49:44,434
l'll be there soon.

1054
01:49:46,666 --> 01:49:48,667
We will sit and talk...okay?

1055
01:49:50,433 --> 01:49:51,767
You don't want to be with me?

1056
01:49:53,333 --> 01:50:00,807
ln Kerala, that day you asked me
to come away with you?

1057
01:50:02,466 --> 01:50:03,600
Today you are saying ''don't''.

1058
01:50:05,433 --> 01:50:06,867
That day you also said you won't,

1059
01:50:07,133 --> 01:50:09,435
Why this change of mind today...
all of a sudden?

1060
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:14,769
l'll come there...
we can't be together here.

1061
01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:17,768
l am working day and night.

1062
01:50:18,766 --> 01:50:21,201
l'll come there, let's decide.

1063
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:40,333
We'll decide, okay.

1064
01:50:42,533 --> 01:50:47,671
l'll wait till you come.

1065
01:51:35,166 --> 01:51:36,100
Take out the light,
field is appearing.

1066
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,268
Brother, loosen the cable, can't reach.

1067
01:51:39,933 --> 01:51:41,034
When did Jessie tell you this?

1068
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:44,769
Day before yesterday night, buddy.
- Then why didn't you tell me yesterday?

1069
01:51:46,699 --> 01:51:48,935
So what do you want to do now?

1070
01:51:49,933 --> 01:51:51,167
l'll somehow meet her
and come back.

1071
01:51:51,833 --> 01:51:55,036
Please get me permission
from the director.

1072
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,635
Okay, l'll talk to him.
You go now.

1073
01:52:08,699 --> 01:52:09,834
Near the park on the left.

1074
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:55,168
Why did you come?

1075
01:52:56,166 --> 01:52:57,100
What is this SMS?

1076
01:53:07,166 --> 01:53:09,034
l sent it because you were in Goa.

1077
01:53:10,266 --> 01:53:11,767
l thought you'll not come.

1078
01:53:14,699 --> 01:53:17,602
l can't make you understand.

1079
01:53:18,833 --> 01:53:20,367
l can't talk to you.

1080
01:53:57,633 --> 01:53:58,700
l'm here now?

1081
01:54:00,033 --> 01:54:01,167
Tell me what l should do.

1082
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:02,967
Where do you want to go?

1083
01:54:03,833 --> 01:54:05,834
Okay then, tell me
what the hell is your problem?

1084
01:54:06,699 --> 01:54:08,168
l am your problem, Karthik.

1085
01:54:08,933 --> 01:54:10,167
l'm the real problem.

1086
01:54:11,266 --> 01:54:13,101
l chose a wrong time to say
l was coming.

1087
01:54:14,166 --> 01:54:15,634
You couldn't do anything, right?

1088
01:54:17,033 --> 01:54:21,270
Atleast for ten minutes you would have
thought what to do, right?

1089
01:54:24,699 --> 01:54:26,034
That isn't how it should be.

1090
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,168
l don't want you to suffer
because of me.

1091
01:54:33,166 --> 01:54:35,601
l know this won't change.

1092
01:54:37,166 --> 01:54:39,301
Yes, l wanted to come that day.

1093
01:54:40,033 --> 01:54:41,167
That moment.

1094
01:54:44,933 --> 01:54:46,834
Today, l feel like l want to let go.

1095
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,936
Not feel, l've decided.

1096
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:58,602
l told you earlier...
you didn't take me seriously.

1097
01:54:58,833 --> 01:55:00,601
You didn't take it as a problem.

1098
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,102
l love you, but said no.

1099
01:55:07,933 --> 01:55:10,835
lf you hadn't come after me,
l would have been just myself.

1100
01:55:11,033 --> 01:55:13,835
l would have married
the guy my dad chose.

1101
01:55:16,633 --> 01:55:18,368
Why did you say you love me?

1102
01:55:19,699 --> 01:55:22,169
Why did you come to Kerala
and apologise? Why?

1103
01:55:24,033 --> 01:55:25,834
Why did you kiss me in the train?

1104
01:55:27,166 --> 01:55:31,103
Why did you come for my wedding?
Why did you follow me?

1105
01:55:33,166 --> 01:55:35,268
Six months...how we spent time?

1106
01:55:37,366 --> 01:55:38,700
How many problems you'd to face?

1107
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:42,602
You know, right? Why then?

1108
01:56:02,266 --> 01:56:04,768
This doesn't feel good...
l don't want it.

1109
01:56:04,966 --> 01:56:07,168
Let's forget and move on.

1110
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:11,834
Your decision is wrong.

1111
01:56:12,166 --> 01:56:13,834
lt's not a problem at all.

1112
01:56:14,833 --> 01:56:19,304
l'll wait however long.
If you're 52, l'll be 50, l'll wait till then.

1113
01:56:19,699 --> 01:56:22,102
l'll see you now and then.

1114
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:26,704
That's why l don't want it.
Why should you wait?

1115
01:56:35,033 --> 01:56:39,604
l'd rather lose you, than my parents!
Please let me go.

1116
01:56:49,266 --> 01:56:53,269
l swear this won't work.

1117
01:56:55,833 --> 01:56:58,969
l can never do that.
l can't. l won't.

1118
01:56:59,166 --> 01:57:01,635
lt's only because of your dad and brother?!
l will talk to them.

1119
01:57:01,833 --> 01:57:04,635
Please Karthik don't do it,
it'll be embarrassing.

1120
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:06,301
Go away, please.

1121
01:57:10,699 --> 01:57:11,767
l swear something has
happened to you.

1122
01:57:12,266 --> 01:57:13,934
You've gone mad.

1123
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,267
This is how l am Karthik...

1124
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:22,102
l don't know myself any more.
l don't know what l want.

1125
01:57:22,633 --> 01:57:26,103
l like pain...l like this pain.

1126
01:57:30,699 --> 01:57:33,969
Of all the girls in the world
why did you fall in love with me?

1127
01:57:38,699 --> 01:57:39,767
What did l do?

1128
01:57:40,699 --> 01:57:42,168
l just walked past you...
That's all l did.

1129
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:52,301
l hate watching films.

1130
01:57:52,933 --> 01:57:54,634
Darkness...crowd...loud noise.

1131
01:57:56,166 --> 01:58:01,838
And isn't it an irony you
chose to be a filmmaker?

1132
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:03,100
You and l won't gel.

1133
01:58:12,933 --> 01:58:14,167
Are you mad?

1134
01:58:15,699 --> 01:58:18,102
You don't like films?
For that will you leave me?

1135
01:58:42,033 --> 01:58:43,267
Call Jessie.

1136
01:58:45,699 --> 01:58:46,967
You'll not understand words.

1137
01:58:56,699 --> 01:58:57,834
Karthik, just go away.

1138
01:59:33,699 --> 01:59:35,601
l didn't realise this pain
would be so intense.

1139
01:59:35,766 --> 01:59:41,171
Don't hate me too much...
l don't know why l did this!

1140
01:59:46,699 --> 01:59:49,836
Sheer madness...so foolish...
just couldn't figure out why!

1141
01:59:53,033 --> 01:59:54,701
Those same thoughts in my mind.

1142
02:00:33,033 --> 02:00:34,768
Just go...so humiliating!

1143
02:00:36,366 --> 02:00:38,968
''What? Did your brother send you?''

1144
02:00:39,166 --> 02:00:46,106
l said ''l just came to see her,l don't
even know where my brother is''.

1145
02:00:47,033 --> 02:00:48,033
Did you see her?

1146
02:00:51,166 --> 02:00:52,367
She's got married!

1147
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:58,035
She's not here,
she is somewhere in the U.K.

1148
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:03,104
He even apologised for not inviting us
as it was all done in a hurry.

1149
02:01:04,033 --> 02:01:05,968
You have drifted far away
from me Jessie.

1150
02:01:07,033 --> 02:01:08,267
You have even closed all doors!

1151
02:01:11,366 --> 02:01:13,101
Why did you stop Karthik?

1152
02:01:15,266 --> 02:01:18,035
Forget all this and
concentrate on your work.

1153
02:01:34,066 --> 02:01:35,267
We got yelled at because
of you yesterday!

1154
02:01:37,133 --> 02:01:40,236
Director thinks you are the only
capable assistant!

1155
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,068
ls that why you are
kneeling down beside me?

1156
02:01:45,566 --> 02:01:46,934
l heard you even know Hindi?

1157
02:01:47,566 --> 02:01:49,267
Do you've to tell him that too?
Is it necessary?

1158
02:01:49,466 --> 02:01:51,000
Don't be so pleased with yourself.

1159
02:01:51,666 --> 02:01:54,335
He'll suddenly bark at you...
when he's angry, that's it.

1160
02:01:57,333 --> 02:01:59,068
Got it?

1161
02:02:05,566 --> 02:02:06,934
l don't know when it happened.

1162
02:02:13,899 --> 02:02:16,936
Before you say anything else
l have to tell you something.

1163
02:02:19,233 --> 02:02:25,005
l loved a girl...
it's _o years since she left me.

1164
02:02:27,133 --> 02:02:28,467
l am unable to forget her.

1165
02:02:29,933 --> 02:02:34,003
l don't know where she is...
what she's doing?

1166
02:02:37,333 --> 02:02:40,569
But she is sitting here...
and not going away from me.

1167
02:02:45,899 --> 02:02:48,402
l can easily get into
a relationship with you.

1168
02:02:50,566 --> 02:02:52,134
But it won't be whole hearted.

1169
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:54,467
l can't be crazy about you.

1170
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:57,068
You will realise it yourself.

1171
02:03:01,133 --> 02:03:05,070
She's haunting me...
l have to come out of this.

1172
02:03:05,333 --> 02:03:07,935
Till then let's refrain, Nandini!

1173
02:03:12,066 --> 02:03:14,601
l don't know what to say.

1174
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,469
l have been trying to write script for
the past six months but couldn't.

1175
02:03:22,666 --> 02:03:24,334
Don't know why?

1176
02:03:27,466 --> 02:03:29,901
l got a good idea now for a script.

1177
02:03:30,666 --> 02:03:31,933
l am going to write now.

1178
02:04:18,199 --> 02:04:21,269
The breeze that climbs
over mountains...

1179
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,869
The newly-wed breeze...

1180
02:04:32,133 --> 02:04:38,138
That worships the cross on
the church steeple...

1181
02:04:39,466 --> 02:04:47,273
To that breeze, the land of Kerala
extends a warm welcome...

1182
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,336
My darlingt

1183
02:04:56,766 --> 02:05:01,270
My darlingt

1184
02:05:02,866 --> 02:05:05,535
My darlingt

1185
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,338
My darlingt

1186
02:05:36,766 --> 02:05:39,802
This auspicious moment
may you be happyt

1187
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,336
May the bride forever
be happily wedded

1188
02:05:50,933 --> 02:05:55,003
Of all the girls in the world...

1189
02:05:55,199 --> 02:05:57,869
why did l fall in love with Jessie?
Correct? l know a little Telugu.

1190
02:06:07,333 --> 02:06:08,200
l'm writing it.

1191
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:21,769
lt'll definitely work out.

1192
02:06:24,199 --> 02:06:25,534
My film has been confirmed.

1193
02:06:26,866 --> 02:06:28,133
Congrats buddy.
- Thanks buddy.

1194
02:06:28,333 --> 02:06:29,767
l'm so happy buddy.

1195
02:06:32,433 --> 02:06:34,201
Thanks buddy, eveything was
possible because ofyou.

1196
02:06:35,933 --> 02:06:38,935
What's the title of your film...Jessie?

1197
02:06:41,766 --> 02:06:42,433
You are a geniust

1198
02:06:42,766 --> 02:06:52,275
ls there enough love for the sea
to serenade to the shore?

1199
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:08,145
Do you still have love in your heart
to melt like a candle?

1200
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:15,805
My darlingt

1201
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,803
My darlingt

1202
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:35,474
My darlingt

1203
02:07:45,133 --> 02:07:48,135
ln this auspicious moment
may you be happyt

1204
02:07:48,333 --> 02:07:51,469
May the bride forever
be happily weddedt

1205
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:14,104
lf you had seen me and gone away
l would not have come after you.

1206
02:09:20,566 --> 02:09:24,336
l know, you've been doing that
for the past three years.

1207
02:09:33,033 --> 02:09:36,770
l am glad you came...
that's why we are here now.

1208
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,335
l would not have gone away
without talking to you.

1209
02:09:42,833 --> 02:09:44,768
That's what l have been doing
all these years.

1210
02:09:45,899 --> 02:09:46,700
Enough.

1211
02:10:05,766 --> 02:10:07,834
You've become a director.

1212
02:10:10,766 --> 02:10:15,370
My first film is half way through,
30 days of shoot left...release in summer.

1213
02:10:16,699 --> 02:10:19,035
Your dream, right?
It's come true.

1214
02:10:21,566 --> 02:10:22,900
l am truly happy for you.

1215
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:24,901
Only few can do it.

1216
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,436
How's everyone at home?

1217
02:10:38,666 --> 02:10:39,433
They are all good.

1218
02:10:43,433 --> 02:10:44,367
What else?

1219
02:10:58,766 --> 02:11:02,102
Do you want to say
or ask some thing?

1220
02:11:06,699 --> 02:11:08,101
There is some one else
in your life...Karthik?

1221
02:11:10,433 --> 02:11:12,368
l am sure there is.

1222
02:11:12,899 --> 02:11:17,437
Someone beautiful...
with clarity of thought.

1223
02:11:18,666 --> 02:11:19,833
Unlike me.

1224
02:11:20,899 --> 02:11:22,001
You found, right?.

1225
02:11:25,433 --> 02:11:29,570
Yes, there's another girl
in my life, Jessie.

1226
02:11:39,666 --> 02:11:40,666
Tell me about her.

1227
02:11:45,699 --> 02:11:47,001
Very beautiful girl,

1228
02:11:49,566 --> 02:11:52,502
She is very intense,
she speaks very well.

1229
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,501
She loves me very much.

1230
02:11:57,100 --> 02:12:00,369
She liked me the moment
she saw me.

1231
02:12:02,433 --> 02:12:03,834
l too got connected to her.

1232
02:12:05,666 --> 02:12:06,900
We are always together.

1233
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:13,002
When you left me...
l didn't even know why...

1234
02:12:16,333 --> 02:12:17,834
For sometime l was angry...
l was clueless for 3 months.

1235
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,370
Everything is well set now.
After that my life has been good.

1236
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:36,901
Tell me about her.

1237
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:46,903
Kind of curly hair till here,

1238
02:12:49,699 --> 02:12:55,005
feel like smiling when she walks.

1239
02:12:55,433 --> 02:13:00,371
Lovely voice...hates foul language...

1240
02:13:02,766 --> 02:13:04,434
wears sari often.

1241
02:13:08,333 --> 02:13:11,369
Has a style of her own...
hardly uses make-up...

1242
02:13:13,766 --> 02:13:15,834
Can look at her... non-stop.

1243
02:13:18,699 --> 02:13:20,435
We have been out a lot on my bike.

1244
02:13:23,766 --> 02:13:25,667
She loves me a lot.

1245
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:32,704
But she hates watching movies.

1246
02:13:39,766 --> 02:13:41,033
l have kissed her...

1247
02:13:44,766 --> 02:13:47,368
her Telugu has a touch of Malayalam.

1248
02:13:50,333 --> 02:13:51,767
l flipped for that!

1249
02:13:53,566 --> 02:13:58,337
l have held her in my arms
for three hours.

1250
02:14:00,766 --> 02:14:02,100
l'm mad about her.

1251
02:14:04,899 --> 02:14:07,335
Her name is Jessie, Jessie!

1252
02:14:16,766 --> 02:14:18,434
She is still there in my life.

1253
02:14:20,899 --> 02:14:26,438
After you left me,
l moved on...to her.

1254
02:14:31,433 --> 02:14:36,337
Can't forget my first love that easily.

1255
02:14:40,766 --> 02:14:41,900
But l am not in her life.

1256
02:14:43,333 --> 02:14:46,436
She loves her mom and dad a lot.
More than me.

1257
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:49,769
Don't get me wrong,
l appreciate that.

1258
02:14:51,899 --> 02:14:53,768
How many girls will feel that way?

1259
02:14:57,899 --> 02:15:05,040
Knowing they won't accept me,
she left me. l think she's married.

1260
02:15:08,766 --> 02:15:11,702
Whatever it is...she left me.

1261
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:46,768
l am not married, Karthik.

1262
02:15:48,566 --> 02:15:53,337
lt's true that l left you...
but l am still single.

1263
02:15:57,333 --> 02:15:59,435
My dad refused to accept you.

1264
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:03,903
l refused to accept his choice
and l landed here.

1265
02:16:04,699 --> 02:16:06,568
lt's _o and a half years
since l came here.

1266
02:16:09,566 --> 02:16:11,000
My parents were here last year.

1267
02:16:11,433 --> 02:16:14,669
My dad asked me to get married...
l refused.

1268
02:16:15,766 --> 02:16:17,334
He left in anger.

1269
02:16:30,333 --> 02:16:34,336
l don't have anyone...only you.
True...

1270
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:41,571
l agree...first love...can't forget.

1271
02:16:44,566 --> 02:16:47,702
There's not a moment
you are not with me.

1272
02:16:48,566 --> 02:16:54,705
l am sorry l walked away...
didn't pick your calls.

1273
02:16:56,766 --> 02:16:58,367
l thought you will move on.

1274
02:17:17,566 --> 02:17:23,571
We shouldn't have met...
l would have carried on with my life.

1275
02:17:32,766 --> 02:17:36,569
Let's marry, Jessie...
today...now!

1276
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,034
lf we meet ten years later...

1277
02:17:44,433 --> 02:17:47,769
you'll say ''that moment is gone,
why didn't you ask me then?''

1278
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:50,034
l'm asking you for the second time...
Iet's get married.

1279
02:17:50,433 --> 02:17:53,369
l want to live with you,
that's my last wish.

1280
02:17:53,566 --> 02:17:56,568
l don't have any other wish.
Let's get married right now.

1281
02:17:56,766 --> 02:17:58,567
Let's start our life together
from today.

1282
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:10,700
Okay, let's get married.

1283
02:18:20,766 --> 02:18:25,904
But what about your parents?
We have been apart only for their sake.

1284
02:18:26,899 --> 02:18:28,334
l'll take care...l'll handle it.

1285
02:18:28,899 --> 02:18:30,668
Let's get married.

1286
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:39,900
This is America.

1287
02:18:40,433 --> 02:18:42,368
l can kiss you in the
middle of the road!!

1288
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:20,307
Whom He decides to be a couple...

1289
02:19:21,233 --> 02:19:26,371
He will unite them in the end...

1290
02:19:27,233 --> 02:19:31,136
My heart, l saw again and again...
pinched myself if it's true...

1291
02:19:31,299 --> 02:19:33,969
Believed what was happening...

1292
02:19:34,133 --> 02:19:38,136
l saw you with me,
l saw myself with you...

1293
02:19:38,299 --> 02:19:40,969
l gave all myself to you...

1294
02:19:41,133 --> 02:19:47,305
God has decided
Iong back to unite us...

1295
02:19:47,633 --> 02:19:51,303
We'll never split...

1296
02:19:51,633 --> 02:19:54,635
She's milky way...
You're gentle drizzle...

1297
02:19:54,799 --> 02:19:59,871
The love in you is eternal...

1298
02:20:00,033 --> 02:20:01,434
She's pupil of eye...
You're eyelid...

1299
02:20:01,766 --> 02:20:05,035
Nobody can ever separate them...

1300
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:09,404
My heart, l saw again and again,
l saw in your eyes...

1301
02:20:09,766 --> 02:20:12,068
Eons of happiness...

1302
02:20:12,233 --> 02:20:16,136
l saw you with me,
l saw myself with you...

1303
02:20:16,299 --> 02:20:19,036
l walked along with you...

1304
02:21:02,966 --> 02:21:09,305
Dawns think of sweet nights...

1305
02:21:09,633 --> 02:21:16,139
Courtyards are waiting with
fragrantjasmine twigs...

1306
02:21:16,299 --> 02:21:27,310
Sky...earth...wind...fire...water...
all the elements are welcoming us...

1307
02:22:34,633 --> 02:22:37,369
When love fever comes down...

1308
02:22:37,966 --> 02:22:40,034
lf you think it's marriage...

1309
02:22:41,266 --> 02:22:46,971
Modern era will end
with death only...

1310
02:22:56,733 --> 02:22:57,667
Teresa, see who's at the door.

1311
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,067
l am in the rest room.

1312
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,069
Hey! Film is over.
They didn't show what the dad said.

1313
02:23:37,433 --> 02:23:38,400
He showed what is to be shown.

1314
02:23:39,133 --> 02:23:40,000
Who cares...
they got together, right?

1315
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:45,067
How's the film?

1316
02:23:45,733 --> 02:23:46,500
Awesome!

1317
02:23:50,066 --> 02:23:50,900
You've done a great job.

1318
02:23:53,666 --> 02:23:55,200
l saw myself on screen.

1319
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,134
l felt like seeing myself.

1320
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:00,467
l saw myself on screen.

1321
02:24:01,399 --> 02:24:02,801
Even the house looks the same.

1322
02:24:02,966 --> 02:24:04,734
l wanted it that way...
put up a set like that.

1323
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,868
Can't make all the incidents
in our life into a film.

1324
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:12,068
l haven't shown anything wrong.

1325
02:24:12,399 --> 02:24:13,534
l didn't say that.

1326
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:17,169
Am l such a good person?
Not at all.

1327
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:22,402
l showed you as good person
for the film.

1328
02:24:27,833 --> 02:24:29,901
The movie is a hit...
good response...

1329
02:24:30,066 --> 02:24:33,002
Entire team is going to PVR,
joining us sir?

1330
02:24:33,166 --> 02:24:34,800
You carry on, l'll join you later.
- Okay sir.

1331
02:24:37,466 --> 02:24:40,502
They will say like that only,
l've to find it out myself.

1332
02:24:40,799 --> 02:24:42,067
Only then l'll know the real talk.

1333
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,435
Everyone seems to know
you are talented...except me.

1334
02:24:49,166 --> 02:24:50,734
You should've married another girl.

1335
02:24:51,166 --> 02:24:52,634
This is the sixth film l have seen.

1336
02:24:53,733 --> 02:24:57,069
l can't understand or
appreciate films.

1337
02:25:00,133 --> 02:25:02,602
lf you're with me,
l'll make only good films.

1338
02:25:11,533 --> 02:25:14,769
That scene in Central park
made me almost cry.

1339
02:25:17,133 --> 02:25:19,001
l never said so many sorry.

1340
02:25:19,866 --> 02:25:22,735
Your heroine said it three times.

1341
02:25:24,666 --> 02:25:26,601
Did we kiss in the middle of the road?

1342
02:25:26,733 --> 02:25:26,899
Yes.

1343
02:25:28,399 --> 02:25:30,802
No way.
l remember very well.

1344
02:25:30,966 --> 02:25:34,803
You carried me, turned around
but never kissed me.

1345
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:37,868
What's this Jessie?
You've forgotten it.

1346
02:25:38,033 --> 02:25:40,068
What a kiss it was!
A kiss that gave me life.

02:25:43,399 --> 02:25:44,067

1349
02:25:44,399 --> 02:25:46,869

he'll definitely like you.

1350
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,501
Dad has started to talk
to me again,

1351
02:25:49,666 --> 02:25:50,967

1356
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,703
You hate darkness,
crowd, and noise.
