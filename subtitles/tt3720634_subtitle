1
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,029
Rang Rang

2
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,948
Rang, please don't kill me.

3
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,575
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

4
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,120
Please don't take my life, Rang, spare me.

5
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,716
Oh shit!

6
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,152
Rang, Rang, I'm sorry.

7
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,487
I didn't mean it, bro.

8
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,864
Hey, what's wrong with you?

9
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,409
Open your eyes, it's me!

10
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,037
Boss!

11
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,290
Played a prank on me for what?

12
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,165
What're you talking about?

13
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,917
If it wasn't you,

14
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,003
then why did my nun doll disappear?

15
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,587
Why don't you take a look?

16
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,510
Jerk!

17
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,388
I was in a hurry.

18
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,181
That's why I fell on the doll.

19
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,892
Where the hell were you, Mod?

20
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,479
What if you strolled around
and got picked up by police?

21
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,983
I was just getting the photos for Tar.

22
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,445
So he can finish the nun doll fast.

23
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,698
You're right. So when will you finish, Tar?

24
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,206
By the way, did you two see my wife?

25
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,959
She went out for a car wash.

26
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,627
Good. When she comes back...

27
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,838
Tell her I went out to meet with a client.

28
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,840
Make sure you tell the same story.

29
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,552
And don't slack around, finish it up.

30
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,356
Is it ruined?

31
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,602
If there's something on your mind,
you can talk to me.

32
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,440
Better if you don't know.

33
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,526
Otherwise, you get spooked.

34
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,071
Hey, we gotta stick together for a long time.

35
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,907
Just think of me as your friend.

36
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:55,997
Yeah, all right.

37
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,709
His name's Rang.

38
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,255
He's the real deal.

39
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,096
He is my idol.

40
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,702
"The Third Night"

41
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,767
Something like this, it hurts like hell.

42
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,770
One-sided love always makes....

43
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,857
your heart bruised.

44
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,181
Yeah, Mom?

45
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,226
Tar, when will you get the money?

46
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,355
I told you. I'll handle it.

47
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,650
I've heard this before.

48
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,360
When will you quit mingling with those pricks?

49
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,780
Mom, if it wasn't for Rang,

50
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,658
I wouldn't know where else
to get the money for you.

51
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,742
Where is the money?

52
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,995
He's already dead and you still hope
to get some?

53
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,958
I gotta go, Mom.

54
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,419
Hey, what took you so long?

55
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,340
Um... I just stopped for an errand.

56
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,218
Meng,

57
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,887
Did you reach the client?

58
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,639
I'm trying.

59
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,766
But Rang's the only one with the connection,

60
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,184
So what can I do?

61
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,103
I wonder.

62
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,897
And now he fucking died
in a car crash outta jealousy.

63
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,358
Gotta blame Goi and Boso.

64
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,278
I saw right through that whore from the start.

65
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,822
She was only there for his dough.

66
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,657
She's never true to him.

67
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,576
And that asshole Boso.

68
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,829
Worked for him for years, still betrayed him.

69
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,289
Fucking prick!

70
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,978
Rang hasn't died for 3 days
and you fucked his wife?

71
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,689
Show some respect.

72
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,483
You know it yourself how jealous he was!

73
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,320
Watch out, man.

74
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,947
You gotta pay the price.

75
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,659
I'll go pay him respect first.

76
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,787
Then I got something to talk with you guys.

77
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,669
Bastard.

78
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,213
I'll beat the crap outta you some day.

79
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,215
Calm down, bro.

80
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:04,848
Jackass.

81
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,028
Dickhead!

82
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,575
Enough.

83
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,743
Goi

84
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,457
Let me go.

85
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,220
Goi

86
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,055
Goi

87
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,349
Goi

88
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,605
You, slut!

89
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,569
Rang's calling.

90
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,238
You hung up on me?!

91
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,448
Goi

92
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:07,786
Skank.

93
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,916
Shit!

94
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,142
It's the third night,
he's making his power felt!

95
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,314
It's cuz of you, Boso. You hooked up with Goi.

96
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,066
I don't wanna cross with you guys.

97
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,820
But what I want right now is my share of dough.

98
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,240
Before Rang died, Goi was told

99
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,158
that client would transfer the payment
with the password.

100
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,454
It means right now that password
is in Rang's cellphone.

101
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,042
But the police didn't give us back his cell.

102
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,127
Before the crash,

103
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,921
He was still calling me.

104
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,258
It's supposed to be somewhere around there.

105
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,510
We gotta find it.

106
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,303
Who got the ATM card?

107
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,597
Rang must've kept it at the shop.

108
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,724
Here is the plan.

109
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,518
We all go there to look for the cell.

110
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,436
Except you, Tar.

111
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,939
You go back to the shop and search
for the card.

112
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,191
I'm not going back alone, man.

113
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,734
You're shitting your pants now?

114
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,152
You want the money or not?

115
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,654
Don't give me bullshit.

116
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,617
So be it.

117
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,497
Meng, I think...

118
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,166
I don't trust both of them.

119
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,669
Get your ass back to find that ATM card.

120
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,254
And keep me informed.

121
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,358
You guys go there, I'll go this way.

122
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,652
Goi

123
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,028
Goi

124
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,363
Goi

125
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,240
Goi, try calling his cell.

126
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,161
We may hear it ring.

127
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,665
It's been three days,

128
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,126
The battery might be dead after him.

129
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,215
Let's try it, first.

130
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,159
The number you're trying to reach
is not available.

131
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,584
Please leave your message after the beep.

132
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,295
See? Told you.

133
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,086
Open!

134
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,152
Tar

135
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,696
Tar

136
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,950
Tar

137
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:45,701
Tar

138
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,121
Whoa, Rang, Rang!

139
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:55,711
You like the pattern? I keep my words, man.

140
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,714
You work for me, I ink you.

141
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,634
Why do you need that much money?

142
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,306
Don't think I'm a grandpa preaching you,

143
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,185
But this kinda work can't feed you forever.

144
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,603
You're still young.

145
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,772
You can do much more than this.

146
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,275
But I wanna be like you.

147
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,901
You're my idol.

148
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,111
Idol?

149
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,238
I'll tell you what, Tar.

150
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,408
I've never thought about
being anyone's role model.

151
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,370
Just being a normal guy in this society
is fine with me.

152
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,540
But I doubt that I can.

153
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,917
Been a long time since I quit dealing.

154
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,752
Still, I returned to this job.

155
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:37,586
Shit.

156
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,088
You did it because of Goi, right?

157
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,056
You must promise me that you won't stay long.

158
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,476
When you get what you need, drop out of this.

159
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,479
Promise?

160
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:01,986
Shit!

161
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,529
You look like you've seen a ghost.

162
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,072
Wimp!

163
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,058
Hey, what the...?

164
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,449
Shit!

165
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,168
Hey.

166
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,597
Rang Rang

167
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,698
Rang's calling.

168
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,079
Goi

169
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:43,958
Goi

170
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:45,834
Goi

171
00:25:59,057 --> 00:25:59,807
Bitch!

172
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:01,934
You whore!

173
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,435
I trusted you!

174
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,688
I love only you.

175
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,108
Don't think that I'd spare you.

176
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,213
What's wrong?

177
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,020
Let's get outta here. Come on.

178
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,072
Why so fucking hurry?

179
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,657
Maybe they found the phone.

180
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,202
Gonna run away with it?
Son of a bitch. Jiab, come on.

181
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,329
Sucker.

182
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,212
Hello, who's that?

183
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:14,965
Why're you calling me?

184
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,013
Who the hell calling me? Dumbprick!

185
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,473
Jiab, hurry up!

186
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,141
Rang's calling.

187
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,187
Come on, man!

188
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,273
Meng.

189
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,278
Sucker.

190
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,829
Something like this, it hurts like hell.

191
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,624
One-sided love always makes....

192
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,833
your heart bruised.

193
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:50,959
It hurts like hell.

194
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,754
It hurts like hell, Rang.

195
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:54,755
What?

196
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,839
The monk's coming.

197
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,507
What?

198
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:57,675
The monk's here.

199
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:02,489
Whoa...Ouch!

200
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,680
Boso, you backstabbed me!

201
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,057
You stole her from me!

202
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,311
Who said I stole her from you?

203
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,231
Goi came to me, herself.

204
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,859
The bitch said to me...

205
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,360
She loved you no more.

206
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,029
Liar.

207
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,363
She loves me.

208
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,325
She's my heart, you get that?

209
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,672
Boso!

210
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,426
Boso!

211
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,764
Boso!

212
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,768
Boso!

213
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,008
2475

214
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,223
Boso!

215
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,196
Goi

216
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,242
Tar

217
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,601
Goi

Damn! That card was seized!

241
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,881
My card!

242
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,801
Fuck!

243
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,353
You survived.

244
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,480
Rang must have spared you.

245
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,652
This is my mom's dream.

246
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,322
I made it come true.

247
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,699
If I die,

248
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,327
I have nothing to worry.

249
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,379
By the way,

250
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,715
What do you need if you actually die?

251
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,051
No idea.

252
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,179
I ran away and came to Thailand

253
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,223
All I want is money.

254
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,725
I wanna buy good stuff like rich people.

255
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,561
If I were rich,

256
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,521
I'll buy the real stuff to burn off.

257
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,857
Then go ahead and die now.

258
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:58,864
I'll burn all this joss paper
to send 'em to you.

259
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,075
So you can be rich when you're dead.

260
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,703
Right now you're broke, man.

261
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,123
If you two die,

262
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,000
I'll burn the leftovers of fake items

263
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,710
Just for you.

264
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,131
You said you're meeting with the client.

265
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,259
Not anymore, her husband's there.

266
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,928
Gotta eat the leftovers again.

267
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,390
Tar, I'm starving.

268
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,142
Go get something for me.

269
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,895
I'm talking to you, dumbo.

270
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,025
Money?

271
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,657
As usual.

272
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,743
Got that.

273
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,787
Shithead.

274
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,385
Boss, the nun is Christian.

275
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,013
Why would she need joss paper?

276
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,973
You ask me? How the hell could I know?

277
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,727
All the know is this nun... is goddamn powerful.

278
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,607
Thai, Chinese, Western, Laotain, you name it.

279
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,527
Run for life every damn time.

280
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,239
Mod, you prick.

281
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,203
You shouldn't have provoked me.

282
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,413
Wanna know how fierce she is?

283
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,333
Good.

284
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,919
I'll tell you the story.

285
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,254
What the heck?

286
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,304
"The Convent"

287
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,764
Legend has it...

288
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,309
In the abandoned black church
next to our school,

289
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,144
There was a headless nun

290
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,729
who shot herself to death because of love.

291
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:59,651
And she continues to play the piano
despite having no head.

292
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,278
It's also said that...

293
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,031
In late night...

294
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,328
If you hear the sound of piano
coming out of that church,

295
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,624
It's either someone's wishing for their love

296
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,586
Or someone's...

297
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,131
...dead.

298
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,221
They said that cloistered nun...

299
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,434
died of a broken heart.

300
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,609
So, what is a cloistered nun?

301
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,639
A nun who take vows of stability to church
til they die,

302
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,186
Gives up the secular world,

303
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,731
Incessantly prays for all sins,

304
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,068
Does her routines only in the church.

305
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,737
No one's allowed to go in,

306
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,448
Nor are they allowed to leave.

307
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,784
And most importantly,

308
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,120
You're not allowed to be in love with anyone,

309
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,373
Apart from God.

310
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,627
That's why everyone calls her...

311
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,046
The Bride of God.

312
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,841
This nun was a good bride.

313
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,470
She always stuck to her routines.

314
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,150
Until one day...

315
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,154
She fell in love with somebody, an outsider.

316
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,662
Instead of praying to God
for all sins like she used to,

317
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,540
She played the piano,

318
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,418
Sending her love through the song to outside,

319
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,087
Hoping that someone will hear it.

320
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,217
As time passed, she fell deeper and deeper.

321
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,389
Finally, her desire was fulfilled.

322
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:39,978
That someone accepted her love.

323
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,814
Wow, so romantic.

324
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,732
But it wasn't like that.

325
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,111
She felt guilty towards God,

326
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,613
That she loved someone else.

327
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,117
She lost faith in herself.

328
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,414
She knew that she couldn't stop
this forbidden love.

329
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,000
So she made up her mind.

330
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,717
What's next?

331
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,469
After committing suicide,

332
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,345
Even though her head fell off,

333
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,265
Her hands continued to play the piano.

334
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,276
Since she had such faith in love,

335
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,278
Legend has it that...

336
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,823
If someone's wishing to the headless nun,

337
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,076
Their wishes will be granted.

338
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,953
Sounds like Kwan, the senior student.

339
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,122
They say she went to pray to that nun,

340
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,041
So Tong broke up with her girlfriend

341
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,959
And got together with her.

342
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,545
How could that wish be granted?

343
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,880
They were not together for so long...

344
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,381
...before Kwan mysteriously disappeared.

345
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,134
Recently, Tong just dropped out of school.

346
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,136
Don't you think it's weird?

347
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,099
According to the legend,

348
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,977
To wish to the headless nun,

349
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,729
you have to go alone,

350
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,982
Slit your palm,

351
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,110
And place a red rose on the piano.

352
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,071
Once you get what you want,

353
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,825
you must go back to the church alone

354
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,536
At 3 AM

355
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,912
3 AM?

356
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:21,913
Yep.

357
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,042
And you must play the same song
she played til the end.

358
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,088
No matter what you see...or experience,

359
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,131
You must not stop

360
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,968
In order to show your gratitude.

361
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,096
They said on some nights

362
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,056
the headless nun even joined.

363
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,015
Shit.

364
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,226
She's damn lonely.

365
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,687
If you fail to follow these procedures,

366
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,356
you'll be dead.

367
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,482
Just like Kwan!

368
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,234
Watch your mouth!

369
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,319
She just disappeared. She didn't die.

370
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,240
Damn, slit yourself for blood and ghosts,

371
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,659
I'd rather be an old maid.

372
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,079
Even if you swore, no one would take you.

373
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,164
Ouch, that's harsh.

374
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,127
What are you girls doing?

375
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,214
Isn't it bedtime?

376
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,632
Other friends have long holidays.

377
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,551
Shit on us in dorms,

378
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,094
Fucking extra courses.

379
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,554
Go.

380
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,015
Turn off the light and sleep

381
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,310
Unless you want your holistic points
be deducted.

382
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,767
Now, Sister must be wondering...

383
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,270
Where Kullanan is?

384
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,565
I don't care.

385
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:13,941
I'm bored to death,

386
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,568
holed up all day long in the dorm,

387
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,320
can't go anywhere.

388
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,578
Hey,

389
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,207
I've got somethin' for ya.

390
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,483
Whoa.

391
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,527
I was just kidding.

392
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,570
Didn't mean for you to get the real tattoo.

393
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,327
I know you're scared of needles.

394
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,413
Why did you do it?

395
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,332
Let me see, did it hurt?

396
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,962
You're the one who told me

397
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,505
That if I get a tattoo,

398
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,633
You'll be my girlfriend.

399
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,858
Will you be my girlfriend now?

400
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:50,872
Really?

401
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,836
For real?

402
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,504
Absolutely.

403
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,206
You can't love somebody else.

404
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,958
You're mine.

405
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,935
How long you been here?

406
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,855
Why? Afraid that I caught something?

407
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,070
Sorry.

408
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,076
Whoa, your ex's so mean.

409
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,205
Let her be. She's such an idiot.

410
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:03,648
Easy.

411
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,358
Why don't you get off my back already?

412
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,862
Just cut it off.

413
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,907
What you talking about?

414
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,576
Don't pretend that you're innocent.

415
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,621
What the heck did you put in my locker?

416
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,499
Isn't it a bit too far?

417
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,713
So there's someone
who hates you more than I do.

418
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,100
Is this yours?

419
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,113
This kinda thing can belong to anyone.

420
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,281
Oh yeah?

421
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,703
But this kinda psychopath can only be you.

422
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,624
It's over between us.

423
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,376
Don't you get it?

424
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,754
Just let me go.

425
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,464
I don't love you.

426
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,799
I love Mai.

427
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,260
She already agreed to be my girlfriend.

428
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,475
I didn't pull that prank on you.

429
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,604
Just so you know.

430
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,357
If I really wanna do it,

431
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,109
It won't be just that.

432
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,404
Cuz it's not enough to pay
for what you've done.

433
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,349
You can't love somebody else.

434
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,061
You're mine.

435
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,685
Hey, when will you get outta water?

436
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,729
Sister will catch you like this.

437
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,774
If we're late for the prayer, it's doomsday.

438
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,652
Just one more lap...

439
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,112
And I'll go back to you.

440
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,656
Hurry up then.

441
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,600
Ouch!

442
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,914
To wish to the headless nun,

443
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,624
you have to go alone,

444
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:56,834
At 3 AM

445
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,129
Slit your palm,

446
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,800
And place a red rose on the piano.

447
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,720
Once you get what you want,

448
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,347
you must go back to the church alone.

449
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,654
What's wrong, Khem?

450
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,240
Kwan...

451
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,369
Calm down.

452
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,162
What happened to Kwan?

453
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,540
What did you do?

454
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,917
Kwan...

455
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,794
Kwan's been killed!

456
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:05,921
Kwan...

457
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,300
I saw it.

458
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,928
Her body's right there in the church.

459
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,308
And why did you go there?

460
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:30,571
Gosh.

461
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,866
You believe in an urban legend?

462
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,954
That because I love you.

463
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,749
I don't know how to break up
with Linin and be with you.

464
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,628
I would do everything

465
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,590
Just for you to love me.

466
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,136
Khem...

467
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,186
You really don't have to do this.

468
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,483
You would love someone because you feel so.

469
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,237
Love doesn't come just because you wish.

470
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,415
If you really believe in it,

471
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,084
After the prayers,

472
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,129
I'll go with you at 3 AM

473
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,424
Just for your peace in mind.

474
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,719
And you'll understand.

475
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,314
Shit!

476
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,000
Let's go there.

477
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,227
There's nothing here.

478
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,480
How can it be?

479
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,900
I really saw it. I wasn't mistaken.

480
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,778
Perhaps it was just your imagination.

481
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:18,989
Come on.

482
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,908
Let's get this over with.

483
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,555
Mai,

484
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,432
Did you hear that?

485
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,477
I heard nothing.

486
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,546
Afraid?

487
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,222
You're always tricky.

488
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,768
It's 3 AM according to the legend.

489
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,353
But you're here at 8 PM

490
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,522
You supposed to be here alone.

491
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,982
But no, here you are with Mai.

492
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,151
How can one ever trust you?

493
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,112
What is going on here?

494
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,913
You used to fool people.

495
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,085
Now you're being fooled

496
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,588
and don't know what to say?

497
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:04,511
Mai.

498
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,556
What's all this?

499
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:27,701
How does it feel?

500
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,704
To do something for the one you love,

501
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,540
but she'll never care.

502
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,167
What's going on?

503
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,502
I'm confused now.

504
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,338
Mai secretly adores me

505
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,466
since I was still together with you.

506
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:47,512
She loves me so much that she can do anything.

507
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,141
One thing I asked from her

508
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,603
Is to be with you,

509
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,230
To make you fall for her,

510
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,734
So I can get my revenge.

511
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,615
Mai, why did you do this to me?

512
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,202
I just want you to understand.

513
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,871
Say it to her face.

514
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,790
So eventually Khem will understand

515
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,752
Love doesn't come from wishing.

516
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,588
Why did you do this to me?

517
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:22,964
Why?

518
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,549
- Just let me go.
- Get off.

519
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,301
- I don't love you.
- Get off me.

520
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,260
Let me go!

521
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,637
Get off me.

522
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,180
Get off me.

523
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,730
Help!

524
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:44,277
Help me!

525
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,321
Mai!

526
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,657
Help me, please.

527
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,255
Khem. Khem.

528
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,090
Finish the last note!

529
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,014
Please let me go.

530
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:55,599
I'm sorry.

531
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:56,808
I'm sorry.

532
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:58,268
I'm sorry.

533
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,751
You can't love somebody else.

534
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:07,754
You're mine.

535
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,014
In late night...

536
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:02,392
If you hear the sound of piano
coming out of that church,

537
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,521
It's either someone's wishing for their love

538
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:13,028
Or someone's dead.

539
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:37,886
They said on some nights

540
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,221
the headless nun even joined.

541
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,373
Hey, hold on. We're not done yet.

542
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,250
Wait!

543
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:10,752
Boss.

544
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,713
Damn it. Come back here!

545
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:14,964
What's wrong with you?

546
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,383
Cheating old bastard!

547
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:18,968
They haven't paid me yet.

548
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,014
Where did they go?

549
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:24,474
They don't want it anymore?

550
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,851
Why don't you go ask them?

551
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:28,311
Because of you!

552
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,771
It looks too damn real.

553
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,981
I'll cut it off your salary.

554
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,192
Pick them up.

555
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,986
Hope you lose your legs!

556
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,890
"The Offering"

557
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:17,569
I'm pissed!

558
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,157
Is there nothing that works anymore
around here?

559
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:27,453
Mod, did you mess up my TV?

560
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,874
No salary for you this month!

561
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,417
So it sticks in your head.

562
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,295
You have to be damn careful with my stuff.

563
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,479
Boss! Boss! Boss!

564
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,273
Are you calling me Boss or Bossy?!

565
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,650
Check it out.

566
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,194
What do you want me to look, Mod?

567
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,739
Madame. Since when did you get back?

568
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:49,369
As soon as you did. Are you blind?

569
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,955
Did you eat? Go get something.

570
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,338
Mod, do you notice she's being weird?

571
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,423
You knew it, right?

572
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,466
Yeah.

573
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,344
Being kind to you like this,

574
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,554
She must've done something wrong.

575
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:12,600
Don't you think she wanna be good to us
for the last time?

576
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,022
What are you whispering?

577
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,732
No. Nothing.

578
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,777
Mod, you got work to do, right?

579
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:23,945
Get the hell out.

580
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,196
I'm gonna eat with my wife. Go.

581
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:26,447
Get lost.

582
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,032
As you wish, boss.

583
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:29,867
Keep this for yourself, then.

584
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,336
Just what I wished for.

585
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,255
My favorite hot chilli paste?

586
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,263
Thanks.

587
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,904
Hon, I'm so sorry.

588
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:08,990
It was my fault.

589
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,491
I shouldn't have gone out.

590
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:03,795
Boss!

591
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:09,467
Poor you, shouldn't have gone off like this.

592
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:12,804
She must want you with her.

593
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:28,277
You're a zombie!

594
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:29,821
Zombie, my ass!

595
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,155
I'm faking dead!

596
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:35,493
Hon, I'll go shower, okay?

597
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,320
Juju

598
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,914
Look! Even the cucumber's full of worms!

599
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,917
You watch too many horror films!

600
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,211
Madame is a ghost.

601
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,589
Not a bear, you don't have to fake dead.

602
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,048
I think we should run.

603
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:32,675
But that's your own wife.

604
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,927
You want her? Be my guest!

605
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:37,430
Come.

606
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:38,264
Come.

607
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:42,018
Honey, please come upstairs.

608
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:45,605
Your wife's waiting.

609
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:47,190
Are you going up?

610
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:48,357
She's calling you.

611
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,358
Going up to the ghost?!

612
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:50,610
Come on!

613
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:17,762
Where are you going?

614
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:19,347
Get inside!

615
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,014
Okay.

616
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,566
Where were you going?

617
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:33,152
I wasn't going anywhere.

618
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:35,821
Just wanna take the trash out.

619
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,033
I see.

620
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,409
Good.

621
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,329
Cuz I don't want you to leave.

622
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:46,958
I want you to stay with me.

623
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,630
Hon...I have something to tell you.

624
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:04,225
Stone cold.

625
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:07,019
What I have in my mind...

626
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,939
I still cannot tell you...

627
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,317
Until something's done.

628
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:14,944
What's that?

629
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:16,946
Take you to heaven!

630
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,449
Good luck, Boss.

631
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,042
Don't you love me anymore, hon?

632
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,335
I still love you.

633
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:34,714
But I can't take you like this.

634
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:40,136
You already knew?

635
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:46,601
Hon, I'm sorry!

636
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,822
Mod, turn the light off for what?

637
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,949
It's an accident, I didn't know.

638
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,417
Your cellphone's cool.

639
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,753
It survived such a drop!

640
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,964
You go get it for me, Mod!

641
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,549
No!

642
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:20,593
I'm gonna shove you down.

643
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,554
Go ahead, we'll fall together.

644
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:26,807
Let me fix my pants.

645
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:52,541
Hello?

646
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,383
Honey, she said her husband left.

647
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,676
You can go to her.

648
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:03,469
Holy shit!

649
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,596
You're having an affair? You old cow!

650
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:10,559
Where're you going?!

651
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,896
Juju, please don't hurt me.

652
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:16,357
You, bastard!

653
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:17,191
Mod, help me!

654
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:18,275
Leave us alone!

655
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:29,495
Man, that's close!

656
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:32,623
She was scary as hell while alive.

657
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,209
Now, the ghost version is even more terrifying.

658
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,045
What are we gonna do, Boss?

659
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,797
Is she still here?

660
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:42,800
If you wanna know, go down and find out.

661
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,010
I'll go through the balcony.

662
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:05,906
The beneficiary...

663
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:11,203
Mr.Grerkgiat Hattakitphaisan, Husband.

664
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:15,541
What's this, Boss?

665
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:21,422
My wife left me 10 million baht.

666
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:27,887
Why?!

667
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,525
Juju

668
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,239
Since the day we married,

669
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,451
People have been talking.

670
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,789
They say I look too goddamn handsome

671
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:59,502
to have this shovel-face by my side.

672
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,385
Nobody knows that my Juju...

673
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:09,804
That she had a golden heart?

674
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,680
No, big ass.

675
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:16,310
I love big booty.

676
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:21,190
The only gift I ever gave her

677
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:26,153
...is that damn car.

678
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,906
Think about it.

679
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:33,244
She'd been so nice to me.

680
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:41,168
But I shoved her down the stairs.

681
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,673
Juju.

682
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:55,641
Juju.

683
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,122
Where's that noise from?

684
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,002
I think in front of the shop.

685
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,169
Then let's head back.

686
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,437
Mod, go get me the pail!

687
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,204
Damn it.

688
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,790
Why is it so hard to burn the joss paper
for my wife?

689
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,002
Go get more joss servants!

690
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:07,338
So my wife's taken care of.

691
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:09,423
Get me the new lighter, too!

692
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,098
Should I bring some cards?

693
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,683
She likes playing cards.

694
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,357
You think that she turned around...

695
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:28,734
Cuz she's mad or happy?

696
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:45,167
Juju, may you rest in peace.

697
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,796
- Rest in peace, my ass.
- Boss!

698
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,215
You, too! You think I'm a ghost?!

699
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,510
But you died. So you're a ghost.

700
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,723
Look at my pretty face! Do I look like a ghost?

701
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:16,156
It's really you!

702
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,117
Juju!

703
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,619
You're not dead.

704
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,621
My Juju's alive!

705
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,624
You really think I'm dead?

706
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:27,960
I saw some pictures in the news.

707
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:30,337
It was your car. And there was someone inside.

708
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,089
I figured it was you.

709
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,926
Why did you crash your car like that?

710
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,520
Jackpot 9.

711
01:23:48,064 --> 01:23:49,273
6, three flush.

712
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:04,121
I miss you.

713
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:05,748
There's someone around.

714
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:06,915
Go away.

715
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,253
Which one do you want?

716
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,422
I like it so much.

717
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:26,602
Why didn't you just tell me

718
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,145
that you lost in card games?

719
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,483
I meant to. But I fear you'll get mad.

720
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:35,611
So I tried to put you in a good mood first.

721
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,782
Honey, please come upstairs.

722
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:41,658
Your wife's waiting.

723
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,214
Come on. Let's go.

724
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:56,423
Where're you going?!

725
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:07,684
Let me see, where?

726
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,355
Just a little burn and sting, okay?

727
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,107
But when you fell down,

728
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:14,983
where were you when we turned the light on?

729
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:16,360
We couldn't see you.

730
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,363
I fell too far away. How could you see that?

731
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:20,781
Leave us alone!

732
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,039
Why didn't you tell us?

733
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:30,749
Why sit and cry outside?

734
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,919
My husband has a mistress.

735
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:35,504
You want me to laugh?

736
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,005
Shut the hell up, Mod.

737
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,092
Juju, I don't have any mistresses.

738
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,845
I just had a fling from time to time.

739
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:46,223
I swear, no one from now on. Never again.

740
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:49,226
No one's as good as you, my Juju.

741
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,603
You can lose as much as you want
in the gambling.

742
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:52,980
I won't say a word.

743
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,274
As long as I have my nice wife back,

744
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,693
I'm glad.

745
01:25:59,320 --> 01:25:59,903
Put it on more, baby.

746
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:00,863
You want more?

747
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:02,447
Come here, you cutie.

748
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:03,490
I'm hurting all over.

749
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:05,534
Got shoved down the stairs.

750
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:08,036
I'm sorry, darling.

751
01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:10,581
Hey, where're you going?

752
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,417
It's almost 3 AM, I'll go to bed.

753
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:14,751
No, not yet.

754
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,171
You see, the stuff's all over the place.

755
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:18,630
Clean it up before you hit the sack.

756
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,549
Can't it wait til tomorrow?

757
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:23,510
Both your husband and I made this mess.

758
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,345
Mod, you blame it on me?

759
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:28,640
It's you who misled me with those pics.

760
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,558
- Right.
- Honey,

761
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,226
- Cut his salary.
- Agreed.

762
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:34,146
Still here?

763
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,397
What are you looking at?

764
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:36,773
Wanna have a problem with me?

765
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:39,610
- What ya looking at?
- Like that.

766
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,738
Do as my wife says, don't complain.

767
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,199
And remember,

768
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:47,075
If it weren't for me and my wife,

769
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,244
You would have nowhere to crash.

770
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:51,747
Don't forget to call Tar.

771
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,248
Ask where he is.

772
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,542
Just sent him to buy some curry,

773
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:57,753
Now it's 3 AM and he hasn't shown up.

774
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:18,023
What the fuck's wrong with him?

775
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,820
Hey, Tar just entered the room.

776
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,364
Where is he now?

777
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:45,008
Hey, look at Tar's motorcycle.

778
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:48,053
Is he dead?

779
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:49,763
But who was that?

780
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:53,392
No way, don't talk bullshit.

781
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:56,436
I think we're misunderstanding.

782
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,193
See? His friend's still texting him.

783
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:04,486
He can't be dead.

784
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:06,113
You're right.

785
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,700
But this friend died 3 months ago.

786
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:11,785
Shit.

787
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:13,912
Forget it.

788
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,289
It doesn't matter anyway.

789
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:16,081
Let's go.

790
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,295
- Wait, M'am!
- What now?

791
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,630
Tar used to tell me.

792
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,048
If he dies,

793
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,967
I should bury the photo of his mom with him.

794
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:28,260
Fucking fussy.

795
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:29,553
You get going.

796
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:41,231
Why?!

797
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,457
I think these walls can't keep ghosts away.

798
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,043
That'll be a dead-end for you.

799
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,086
Why now?!

800
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,255
Go check what Tar's doing.

801
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:17,642
He's searching for something.

802
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:20,312
Something in your hand.

803
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:21,730
Give it back to him!

804
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:22,689
Yeah.

805
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:24,358
And you tell him,

806
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,943
If he's dead, go be with his friend.

807
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,487
Go there yourself.

808
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,405
He may listen to an old man

809
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,407
If you don't go now,

810
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,451
I'll kill and send you to be with them.

811
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:36,286
It's always me.

812
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:40,582
Tar

813
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,793
I feel for you.

814
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:45,879
You had to live with fear all the time.

815
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:48,465
From now on,

816
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,176
You must be by yourself.

817
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:53,845
Good luck, man.

818
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,768
What the heck is he doing?

819
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:15,200
Mod...

820
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:18,245
Rest in peace, man.

821
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:26,294
You lived with fake things for all your life.

822
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:29,798
Worked with fake things,

823
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:33,135
You even lived with this fake couple.

824
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:38,682
I kept my promise.

825
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,894
Good luck, pal.

826
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:06,668
How did you go pick up the photos for Tar?

827
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:11,149
Told you.

828
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,194
That'll be a dead-end.

829
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:18,156
Why did you put so much stuff here?!

830
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,407
How can I know?

831
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:21,952
We put 'em here together, not only me!

832
01:32:22,161 --> 01:32:23,787
Tar, don't burn the house.

833
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,206
I'm in here, Tar. Stop.

834
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:27,165
Boss.

835
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:29,459
Look at that.

836
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:29,769
Why did I die so ridiculously?

837
01:33:59,925 --> 01:34:02,302
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

838
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:10,852
Pull over, I said pull over!

839
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:14,397
Hey, I said pull over!

840
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:18,360
I said pull over, do you hear me?!

841
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:19,486
Hey.

842
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,072
Bitch, pull over!

843
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:23,990
Don't you hear?

844
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:25,450
Pull over!

845
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:29,204
What do we do now, Ma'am?

846
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:30,413
She won't stop.

847
01:34:30,873 --> 01:34:32,624
Overtake her! Go block her way!

848
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,636
Ma'am, what if she doesn't stop the car?

849
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:46,930
Don't be afraid.

850
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:49,224
She will have to. She won't dare crash into us.

851
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:50,702
Where you going, Mod?

852
01:35:53,205 --> 01:35:54,873
I'm going to a heavenly place, Boss.

853
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:56,958
Back to my homeland.

854
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,126
You can't call the police to arrest me anymore.

855
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:05,652
Now you're rich, Mod.

856
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:07,529
Nothing left for me.

857
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:57,871
Shit!

858
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:22,937
Oh...lucky me!

859
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:38,286
Come on, Tar. Let's have a ride.

860
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:40,038
Rang

861
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,623
I thought you were dead.

862
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:45,043
Rang, I'm sorry.

863
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:46,419
I don't wanna die yet.

864
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:49,005
I made a mistake. Please go away.

865
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:50,506
I'm sorry!

866
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,550
Fuck!

867
01:38:58,223 --> 01:38:59,057
It can't be true!

868
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:00,767
It can't!

869
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:02,894
No!

870
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:05,313
I don't wanna die.

871
01:39:05,522 --> 01:39:10,526
Tar, let's continue on our way...

872
01:39:10,986 --> 01:39:13,780
Go find the heavenly place. Trust me.

873
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,617
Here is your ride. They sent it to you.

874
01:39:23,582 --> 01:39:25,458
Tar, Come on.

875
01:40:28,897 --> 01:40:29,731
Hon...

876
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:33,317
Tar burnt everything up for Mod.

877
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:36,779
Will anyone burn something for us?

878
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:38,781
Look.

879
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:40,992
There's nothing left.

880
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:43,202
Who said so?

881
01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:46,372
We have each other left.

882
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,083
Let's go, darling.

883
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:51,335
Go where?

884
01:40:52,337 --> 01:40:54,881
Somewhere heavenly for us, Juju.
