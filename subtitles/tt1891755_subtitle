There's just one difference
between a warrior and a terrorist.

33
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,041
...victory!

34
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,303
You're a warrior if you win.

Baby is hungry

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,165
As if you'll die, if you
don't eat for a few days

44
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,925
lt's better to die than

46
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,086

Poking fun at me?

52
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,849
Raghubir sir is unaware
that you sneaked on him

53
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,764
That's why you are still alive

54
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,403
lf he did, that's it!

55
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,404
You can't scare me away
by such empty threats!

56
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,406
Let's see how long
you wag your tongue!

58
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,602

David, we have no way out

61
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,767
You said you've got a sister
You could go, stay with her

62
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,406
No one understood me
in my family

63
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:39,364
l don't know if they will now
But l must give it a try

64
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,163
Bro, special tea for you

65
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,881
From the day you hit Muthu,
you are truly revered!!

66
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,047
Hand me the torch

67
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,282

68
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,640
- This one?
- He's blind, sir

69
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,402
Where is he?

70
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,680
He must be somewhere here

71
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,680
Look over here

72
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,440
- Get up, rascal!
- Not him either, sir

73
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,129
What the hell?

74
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,325
- ls he the one?
- He's new, sir

75
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,640
- Then who?
- He's the one, sir

76
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,200
David...don't

77
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,287
What will you do?

78
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,321
Shut up and sit quiet

79
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:39,981
You are my drug peddler
and you are sneaking on me!

80
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,273
This is a lesson for all of you
if you try to betray me

81
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,315
Muthu, drop him into the sea

82
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:51,874
Raghdev Sinha

83
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:53,764
Supervisor of this camp

84
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:57,476
This is what happens
if you oppose him

85
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:12,637
Hey you!
Come here

86
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:14,954

Come to the station with me

88
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,604
What's the issue, sir?

89
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:24,875
An accused has escaped

90
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:27,235
Stay inside for 2 days
l'll ensure you are paid

91
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:29,204
No, sir

00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:32,997
l wasn't asking you

93
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:33,956

94
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:35,400
- Hey!
- Leave me, sir

95
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:36,283
What do you
think of yourself?

96
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:37,721
Let go, sir

97
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,956
How dare you refuse?
Rascal!

98
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:04,596
We are refugees
But not orphans

99
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:09,633
David...don't
Let go of him

100
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:35,044
l could only do this much

101
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,397
lf you want to do anything
further, he'll be out in 4 days

102
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,279
Take care of him then!

103
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:45,635
Where did your
orphan dialog get you?

104
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,915
Who rushed to your aid?

105
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,923
Come out
You'll get what you deserve

106
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,274
We need 5 volunteers
for lime wash?

107
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:21,921
Didn't l tell you that
they use us for daily labor?

108
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:26,914
White vest
Blue

109
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:29,120
3 people for carpentry

110
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,764
You go

00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:36,880

112
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:44,722
That tall chap
Green ...fatso

113

That's it for today

lf l need anymore

Better give my commission
as soon as you get paid

00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:01,723
Or else, you'll see my cruel side!
Keep that in mind...go...go

117
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:06,840
Bro, l had reserved
a good job for you both

118
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:08,444
But you are walking away
Will you take it up?

119
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:12,839
lf it is a good salary!

120
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,194
Be ready

00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:34,756
Greetings, Bai

122
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:38,004
Muthu...
-Greetings, Bai

123
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,240
What took you so long?

124
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:41,114
These are the 2 fellows
l told you

125
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,884
David
Ranjith

126
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,717
Greetings!
What can we do for you?

127
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,873
l got a whole load
of fish from Madras

128
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,036
Sudden lorry strike

129
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,004
l don't know what to do
Perishable commodity

130
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:55,197
lf you deliver it on time
l'll be relieved l kept my word

131
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:57,762
Okay, how much
will you pay us?

132
00:16:58,325 --> 00:16:59,724
Usually Rs 3000

133
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:01,758
Since there's a strike
l can make it Rs 3500

134
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:02,841
Rs 5000

135
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:05,836
Muthu, your chap is
asking way too much

136
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:09,157
Won't you throw your fish-load
into the sea if they are spoilt?

137
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:10,760
Bhai, just say yes

138
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:11,914
We'll make it up
in consecutive trips

139
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,443
Muthu, you did what
you said you would

140
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,198
l've organized the en route operation

141
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:45,239
lf the load reaches you gain
lf it doesn't twice the gain

142
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,715
You leave now
l'll keep you posted

143
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:01,559
David, you should've slapped
Muthu a couple more times

144
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:02,442
Why?

145
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:04,916
lf one slap could
get us Rs 5000...

146
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:08,394
...2 slaps would have
got us Rs 10,000 each

147
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:11,919
He relented, as soon as you said
the entire fish load will get spoilt

148
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:17,644
Their fear is our power!

149
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:24,043
David, let's finish this job,
live it up, in Madras for a week

150
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:25,636
...and then return

151
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,154
l can also visit my sister

152
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:40,164
Stop the vehicle

153
00:18:57,165 --> 00:18:58,678
Hey! Switch off the engine
Get down...both of you

154
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,075
- What are you carrying?
- Suffering from cold, sir?

155
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,156
Mockery?

156
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:12,165
No...this stink can
be smelt miles away

157
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:15,596
- Fish...can't you smell it?
- Raju, check the load

158
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:25,320
Sir... Diamond

159
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:28,802
What happen?

160
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:29,835
We caught them red-handed

161
00:19:33,485 --> 00:19:34,918
- Kill them both
- Okay, sir

162
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,040
David, if 1 fish has
so many diamonds...

163
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:56,281
...imagine how valuable
the entire load wll be

164
00:20:58,405 --> 00:20:59,838
When polished, just think
what a jackpot!!!

165
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:04,596
lf we sell this, we can easily
line our nest for a lifetime

166
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:09,361
Let's deliver the stuff
at the given address

167
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:21,403
Queen Kausalya's endearing
son, Sri Rama! Wake up, dear

Opened so early?

173
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:49,474
Though we keep nose-crying
we must keep our nose to grindstone!

174
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,521
That's so true

175
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:55,359
Dosa master! Don't add salt
to the batter, l already did

176
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:01,395
Eggplant, raw banana load

179
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,922

No sir, Rameshwaram

l welcomed you
in pure Saivite Tamil

183
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:23,438
You should reply Sivachidambaram

184
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:24,795
Sivachidambaram?

185
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:28,679
Then...Selvaraj?

186
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,874
l That's what folks call me
What will you eat?

187
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:34,878
Fluffy ldli like jasmine,
soft rice fritters, dosa?

188
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:37,280
l brought fish...

189
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:43,240
Fish...wrong address
l'll take leave

190
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:45,244
Son...come here

191
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:50,799
l am the right Selvaraj

192
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:52,075
Aren't you Bhai's hench-man?

193
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:52,797
Yes

194
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:53,875
Bring the vehicle
to the rear side

195
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:54,756
l'll meet you there

196
00:22:57,205 --> 00:23:00,038
- Rear side means?
- Back side, l say

197
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:06,242
Our daily almanac is to be read and
approved by you...wake up Lord Balaji

198
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:17,875
Place it over there
and wash your hands

199
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:24,684
Selva...we are ruined
The whole load went kaput

200
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:25,915
l don't get you!

201
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:27,274
l trusted them and
sent you the goods

202
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:28,435
They just swindled it all

203
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:33,280
lf ever l catch them, l'll ensure
l chop them with a Viking battle-axe!

204
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:34,315
Who should be chopped, Bhai?

205
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,362
l swear l didn't know
the police would check, David

206
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:43,558
Trust me, David
Bro, tell him

207
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:49,557
Police...check post...oil
They are just youngsters

208
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:51,114
lgnore them
Come in

209
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:54,517
- How is Raghubir?
- Looks like even you distrust me!

210
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,638
We've minted money together
Would l ever backstab you?

211
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:02,281
Eat this betel leaf

212
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:07,553
- Selva...
- Go ahead

213
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:13,883
Lotus hidden bees sing solemn hymns
Oh Srinivasa, You are omnipotent

214
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:17,922
Sornamalai! There's a dead
lizard inside, get rid of it

215
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:20,679
Where do you intend staying?

216
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:27,714
We plan on a rejuvenating massage
Then we'll head back to our camp

217
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:32,236
This is for you

218
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:34,318
We've already been paid!

219
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:38,519
This is for a job to-be-done!

220
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:16,201
Face me...the girl from Madurai
Hug...embrace me...just try

221
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:23,756
Pure jasmine...sweet marjoram
Touch...nip me, no need decorum

222
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:28,680
My half-sari slid...wrenched,
for my thirst to be 1st quenched

223
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:32,436
For you, an angel appeared
ldeal age to be favoured

224
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:36,322
Your needle sharp eyes
drew many hamlets in a queue!

225
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:40,202
Thanks to you, heart-a-wanton
On a mind-boggling mission

226
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:48,195
ln our chariot of bliss
Climb in, dear prince

227
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:51,956
lf clouded with doubt
here, you can work out

228
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:55,842
On my nimbus body
your melody

229
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:59,722
Change into rain
Come down to rule again!

230
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:39,762
Your love has no clout here
Only your money we revere

231
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:57,042
A bewildered war zone is this place
lf you give in here, you win the race

232
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:04,204
This is an equal bed
where no one is graded!

233
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:28,674
- Don't wash away the diamonds
- David...careful

234
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:46,203
Father?
Mother?

235
00:29:46,725 --> 00:29:47,521
Are you an orphan?

236
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:42,204
Uncle...

237
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:49,314
David?!

238
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,440
lt's been way too long...

239
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:05,565
- How are you, da?
- l am doing good

240
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:06,754
When did you come?

241
00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:07,961
A while ago

242
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:10,760
- How are you, sis?
- Surviving!

243
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:18,121
l'm glad at least now
you thought of me

244
00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:19,996
How are you, Jasmine?

245
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:21,564
l am fine, David
What did you get for me?

246
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:26,324
Why do you ask this
everytime he comes?!

247
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:28,477
What's wrong?
l've rights

248
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:32,162
lt's okay, she's only asking me!

249
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,284
Where you should
hold a bible in your hand

250
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,078
...you've come armed with a gun

251
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:48,283
You'll never reform, David

252
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:54,356
Why are you mad at uncle
when he's come after so long?

253
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:56,075
Don't scold him

254
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:58,314
Just shut up

255
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:08,761
Uncle, don't take it to heart
You know how my mother is!

256
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:17,283
- Use this money
-No, just visit us often.That's enough

257
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:33,197
Boss...

258
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,684
Hey! Milk is over-boiled!!

259
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:46,479
-Thiruchitrambalam
-Greetings

260
00:32:47,645 --> 00:32:50,318
Koteeswar Rao, you've come
at this hour, in your best outfit?

261
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:52,313
For a specific reason, bro

262
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:56,522
Take a seat
These are all our boys

263
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:03,079
This is David...
Ranjith...Raam

264
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:07,117
David, this is Koti
An old friend of mine

265
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:08,281
Now in Goa

266
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:13,723
How is your boss, Abbas?

267
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:18,075
He's happy
l'm only stuck...

268
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:19,600
What's hassling you?

269
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:24,398
l brought powder for 1 crore
'Party missing' in the last minute

270
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:26,840
l am at a loose end

271
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:28,603
Have you stashed it
safe and sound?

272
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:30,320
Take it and go back
to Goa in one piece!

273
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:33,479
No bro, very tough
to take it back...

274
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:35,724
l was wondering if l could
pass it on to someone here

275
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:38,880
Please help me out, bro

276
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:41,316
Oh God save me! Powder
and l are poles apart!

277
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:42,401
l'll seal the deal for you!

278
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:49,241
David, do you know what
you are letting yourself in for?

279
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:53,595
We should change
our job with the times, bro

280
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:57,474
That's being shrewd!
Or else we'll be extinct

281
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,360
David's very enthusiastic

282
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:07,404
Come to this venue
by 10-00 P.M tomorrow

283
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:09,204
Meanwhile l'll talk to my boss

284
00:34:11,325 --> 00:34:11,962
Sivachidambaram

285
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:16,754
David, l appreciate your courage

286
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,562
But l feel you maybe
a little too avaricious

287
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:21,919
Not greed, bro

288
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:23,596
Hunger!

289
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:32,604
David, why?

290
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,797
lf we meet him ahead of time
he'll be callous towards us

291
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,605
lf we arrive 10 minutes late
he'll think we are irresponsible

292
00:34:41,285 --> 00:34:43,879
That's why on the dot 10-00
will assure him of our intention

293
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:45,761
Sharp 10-00

294
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,242
Hi David...welcome

295
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:04,642
Care for a Scotch?
l gargle only with Scotch!

296
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:11,998
Shall we get to the point?

297
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:18,355
l've spoken to my boss

298
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:27,315
This is heroin.
Worth 1 crore

299
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:32,835
lf you clinch the deal
you get Rs 50,000

300
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:36,521
5%

301
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:45,521
Wait...wait...okay

302
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,321
Finish the deal
Come to Goa

303
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:49,601
And collect your share

304
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:53,245
Have you informed
your boss of the 5% ?

305
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,124
He won't take any decision
without discussing with me

306
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:04,837
How do you know
who your buyer is?

307
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:07,998
lt is only tough to find
good people...bye

308
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:33,034
Ranjith, you and Ram stay here
Kadhir, come with me

309
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:50,722
Boss is inside
Go in

310
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:06,480
Here he is

311
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:19,996
Gun timing!
Name?

312
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:22,920
What have you brought?

313
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:25,960
- Hey! Lottai...

314
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:27,795

00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:37,362
Keep it in

317
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:47,841
What are you waiting for?
Clear the place

318
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:55,476
Money

319
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:56,957
Money?

320
00:37:57,645 --> 00:38:00,443
What gall, guts and spunk
you have to come to MY area

321
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:01,959
...and ask ME for money?

322
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,560
Go back in 1 piece, da!

323
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,438
Hey! Nitwit

324
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:07,994
Won't you pay us
after taking our stuff?

325
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:16,999
Wash your mouth!
l'll take your knee apart

326
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:27,118
Be still, da

327
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:47,081
l told you to go back in 1 piece
Now see this sliced state!

328
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,034
Stop...STOP

329
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:51,561
You asked my name...

330
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:55,035
Billa
David Billa

331
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:03,604
Let's go

332
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:38,995
So you are David?

333
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:42,241
Ranjith

334
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:46,880
Koti told me about you
Did you meet him?

335
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:48,914
l've met you, right?

336
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:19,475
Sir...

337
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:25,120
Abbasi, my consignment has started

338
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:27,037
Dimitri, don't worry

339
00:41:28,165 --> 00:41:29,041

341
00:41:32,765 --> 00:41:33,242
Sure

342
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,396
Are you thinking l'm returning
your own stuff back to you?!

343
00:41:56,845 --> 00:41:57,800
Unbelievable!

344
00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:00,437
A special gift...for you

345
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:12,603
David, meet Samira
My girl friend

346
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:22,642
Okay, we'll meet up this
evening, come to my club

347
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:44,399
Somehow or other in a hazy daze
Somewhere in the wind it dilates

348
00:42:45,485 --> 00:42:52,436
lt lures you into its spell
Heart slips out of its shell

349
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:56,156
This is...a whole new world

350
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:05,634
Though eyes wide open,
dream-world unfurled

351
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:19,520
l like the way you move
You like the way l move

352
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,922
Why don't we dance
together all night long?

353
00:43:24,005 --> 00:43:30,478
A hug let me squeeze
to tease...please

354
00:43:31,165 --> 00:43:37,718
Bounce, bounce, bounce with me?
Bounce, bounce, bounce with me

355
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:12,202
Seeing is not believing
lt is make-believe lying!

356
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:16,043
Beyond your eyes...read
Lies as naked truth indeed

357
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:19,802
Whatever be your desire
savor from this supplier

358
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:23,163
My heart's habitude
to fake...hey dude!

359
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:27,284
lf stars in your eyes, on a high
today is yours on a high five

360
00:44:27,605 --> 00:44:30,961
lf you win, then automatically
this world surrenders totally

361
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:35,235
Your life fractured to fragments
Hand-in-hand nurture moments

362
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:39,762
Let's see a whole new world
splendidly unfold

363
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:39,958
Bounce, bounce, bounce with me?
Bounce, bounce, bounce with me

364
00:45:51,645 --> 00:45:56,161
David, had a good time?
Do you like my club?

365
00:45:57,165 --> 00:46:00,840
You personally own paradise
and if you ask me this question...

366
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:09,036
There's more for you to see

367
00:46:10,165 --> 00:46:12,520
Why don't you stay
for a while with me?

368
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:17,402
Dimitri...

369
00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:19,922
Excuse me

370
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:23,002
Hello Dimitri!

371
00:46:26,645 --> 00:46:27,441
Awesome

372
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:43,315
Okay...l'll think about it

373
00:46:46,565 --> 00:46:47,361
Anything serious?

374
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:52,753
Dimitri's arms consignment has
been ceased by the coastal guards

375
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:57,162
He wants us to help him
He's willing to pay 20 crores

376
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:01,162
Don't Abbasi, we don't know
anyone in that department now

377
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:03,356
Arms prevention act is very rigid

378
00:47:04,805 --> 00:47:06,955
Aspiring for 20 crores...

379
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:10,397
...we shouldn't end up in
lnterpol's most wanted list

380
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:13,273
Where is that consignment now?

381
00:47:36,045 --> 00:47:37,034
We've covered the whole place,sir

382
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:39,601
They are still inside, sir

383
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:42,396
Yes, sir

384
00:49:03,205 --> 00:49:09,041
David, l felt rejuvenated
with you being here with me

385
00:49:11,685 --> 00:49:15,519
Mr Praveen, don't forget me
after this deal

386
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:16,801
Let's see

387
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:28,039
Koti, you are bringing
our future chief minister

388
00:49:28,485 --> 00:49:29,554
Are you planning
to enter politics?

389
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:34,083
He wanted to talk
to you personally

390
00:49:34,445 --> 00:49:38,074
Do you need our help
for the coming election?

391
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:41,517
As long as the present
Chief minister is in power...

392
00:49:41,685 --> 00:49:43,596
...l can't earn a single
rupee like l anticipated!

393
00:49:45,005 --> 00:49:47,724
l want my son Satish
to learn the ropes from you

394
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:50,520
He can learn a lot
He can earn a lot

395
00:49:51,645 --> 00:49:52,361
Bad idea!

396
00:49:55,485 --> 00:49:59,239
This boy bonding
with us is a bad idea?

397
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:02,517
No, us being with this boy

398
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:05,677
David, you don't realize
we'll get Govt. backing

399
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:08,596
We have the power
You have the courage

400
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:09,920
No one can shake us

401
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:13,875
There's more to this business
than mere power and courage

402
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,683
Requires other skills

403
00:50:17,205 --> 00:50:20,003
l've been submerged in
politics for past 30 years

404
00:50:21,045 --> 00:50:22,364
Are you implying that
l'm not adequately qualified?

405
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:25,880
lf you mess up, you'll only
lose your designation

406
00:50:26,725 --> 00:50:28,078
ln this business
lives will be lost

407
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:30,356
Abbasi, l'm not here
to talk to him!

408
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:35,480
Abbasi, you've disgraced me

409
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:38,243
Be prepared to face
the consequences!

410
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:32,802
Yes, Jasmine

411
00:52:35,805 --> 00:52:36,476
David...

412
00:52:39,245 --> 00:52:42,282
David...Jasmine

413
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:44,915
Hello Jasmine!

414
00:52:54,445 --> 00:53:05,083
Grant unto her Eternal rest, oh Lord!
Let perpetual light shine upon her

415
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:26,353
Accept this soul, O merciful God by
the infinite merit of your precious blood

416
00:53:26,845 --> 00:53:32,841
Through Your pious supplication,
grant her pardon for all her sins

417
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:49,601
...we commit her body to the ground
earth to earth, dust to dust

418
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:50,874
Amen

419
00:54:36,245 --> 00:54:38,156
This house is beautiful

420
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:41,561
Hey! lce cream!!

421
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:44,598
Jasmine, this is Mrs Pedro

422
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:47,204
She'll take good care of you

423
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:53,324
Then aren't you
staying here with me?

424
00:54:55,285 --> 00:54:56,320
l'll stay with my boss
in the guest house

425
00:54:58,405 --> 00:54:59,440
David, Abbasi is waiting for us

426
00:55:00,445 --> 00:55:01,560
l'll be there

427
00:55:02,085 --> 00:55:04,838
l thought you'd be with me
You seem to have other plans

428
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:15,195
Fill up the college
application form

429
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,559
Hello
Welcome...welcome. Have a seat

430
00:55:42,565 --> 00:55:44,078
- How is Dimitri?
- He is happy

431
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:49,641
For retrieving their consignment
as agreed, cash has been deposited

432
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:52,636
And a special gift from Dimitri

433
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:04,835
Let the danger be safe with you

434
00:56:07,485 --> 00:56:11,364
Dimitri wants you to come to
Barovia to discuss further business

435
00:56:11,685 --> 00:56:15,803
Dimitri wants you to come to
Barovia to discuss further business

436
00:56:19,525 --> 00:56:21,959
Definitely, Koti will
come on my behalf

437
00:56:26,805 --> 00:56:29,717
- See you in Barovia
- Have a safe trip back

438
00:56:32,965 --> 00:56:33,954
See you, my friend

439
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:44,081
Koti, David will accompany you

440
00:56:44,925 --> 00:56:47,041
Take Bobby also with you
He knows the language

441
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:52,244
Dimitri seems virtuous
But he is such a villain

442
00:56:53,685 --> 00:56:54,276
Be on your guard

443
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:32,883
You go...l'll see you in a bit.

444
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:38,280
So...what have you decided?

445
00:57:38,885 --> 00:57:41,524
The deal is not worth it.

446
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:44,644
Do you think we are fools?

447
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:47,637
Fine, l'll find somebody else

448
00:57:49,605 --> 00:57:51,084
What does he think of himself?

449
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:52,201
So, what do we do now?

450
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:54,118
This won't work. He is useless!

451
00:57:54,765 --> 00:57:55,436
ldiot!!

452
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,316
Wait

453
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:09,796
Who said that?

454
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:12,404
l know you'll order
just ice-cream

455
00:59:16,445 --> 00:59:17,195
lce cream!

456
00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:20,678
l'm off to Barovia on work

457
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,003
Take me with you
- l said, 'on work'!

458
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:28,724
Why don't you guys
get what l am saying?

459
00:59:30,725 --> 00:59:32,397
So what?
Why can't l come?

460
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:36,558
Okay, l'll see you at 8:30 P.M

461
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,122
Sameera!
- David?!

462
00:59:51,245 --> 00:59:53,361
How are you?
- Good!

463
00:59:53,685 --> 00:59:54,322
Shopping?

464
00:59:54,765 --> 00:59:56,437
Just came here to meet a friend

465
00:59:57,205 --> 00:59:59,480
Jasmine...Sameera, my friend

466
01:00:00,045 --> 01:00:01,763
Sameera...Jasmine

467
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:06,723
Alright, David
l'll see you later

468
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:12,601
So this is Sameera?
Now l get it!!

469
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:39,196
Dimitri, meet our friends
from lndia, Bobby...Koti...David

470
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:44,675
Go and check the consignment
- Okay

471
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:52,002
So you are David!
l heard about you

472
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:54,917
He's asking you to
take a look at his factory

473
01:01:02,645 --> 01:01:03,998
This is my factory

474
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:18,920
M4 900 bullets per minute
$70 million turn over

475
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:27,394
M4 900 bullets per minute
$70 million turn over

476
01:01:27,805 --> 01:01:30,273
Total $300 million
turn over per year

477
01:01:31,765 --> 01:01:32,356
Boss

478
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:35,475
Just take a look
l'll be right back

479
01:01:40,165 --> 01:01:41,598
Do arms command
such a steep price in the market?

480
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:44,723
Price is for death, not arms

481
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:49,754
As long as death exists,
market for weapons will thrive

482
01:01:54,725 --> 01:01:55,840
Do you like my factory

483
01:01:57,685 --> 01:01:58,674
He wants to know
if you like his factory

484
01:02:00,205 --> 01:02:05,074
Very much, l think we should
take our business to the next level

485
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,239
David, Dimitri will call and
discuss details of the deal

486
01:02:18,805 --> 01:02:24,675
Don't take any decision
without consulting Abbasi

487
01:02:26,085 --> 01:02:28,394
He sent you just
as a companion.Don't forget that

488
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:29,561
Scared?

489
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:34,564
Don't be present when
l discuss the terms, stay away

490
01:02:36,565 --> 01:02:38,476
l didn't mean it that way

491
01:02:47,325 --> 01:02:48,394
Dimitri wants you in

492
01:03:16,405 --> 01:03:18,965
He's willing to do anything
for us for our help

493
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:24,956
Thank you, we want to ...
do arms business with you

494
01:03:39,245 --> 01:03:42,123
Okay, l don't mind
doing business with you

495
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:45,284
But make sure my 1st consignment
...passes lndian waters

496
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:47,877
lt's worth $500 million

497
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:52,362
Will do

498
01:03:52,765 --> 01:03:53,641
Hello, Dimitri

499
01:04:02,925 --> 01:04:05,997
Jagdish, my friend
lnterpol officer

500
01:04:07,685 --> 01:04:09,596
This is David
Abbasi's main man

501
01:04:11,005 --> 01:04:12,677
He's going to be handling
our new business

502
01:04:13,565 --> 01:04:15,556
l've heard of him
Smart guy

503
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:18,076
You are at the right time
at the right place

504
01:04:20,965 --> 01:04:26,085
Yes...but he has some
people not right, around him

505
01:04:35,645 --> 01:04:37,363
That mongrel was
an lnterpol informer

506
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:41,117
ln my department
Money was being sent through me

507
01:04:41,405 --> 01:04:42,520
He had no clue!

508
01:04:59,085 --> 01:05:03,476
What's the use of you going
if such a deal was struck?!

509
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:05,478
He didn't pay heed to
even a single word l said!

510
01:05:20,685 --> 01:05:23,916
Koti, did you give him tips
on developing our business?

511
01:05:26,045 --> 01:05:26,795
He seems angry?!

512
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:29,922
David, why did l
send you to Barovia?

513
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:32,755
l have my doubts on you

514
01:05:33,565 --> 01:05:36,921
Did that doubt creep
into your mind or Koti's?

515
01:05:37,805 --> 01:05:40,683
Anyone will be suspicious
looking at your behavior

516
01:05:46,845 --> 01:05:51,919
Abbasi, you know l don't
play cloak and dagger stuff!

517
01:05:52,765 --> 01:05:54,437
l know Bobby even
before l knew you

518
01:05:55,445 --> 01:05:57,242
A trust-worthy man
He is dead now

519
01:05:57,605 --> 01:06:01,564
Trust-worthy?
Bobby?

520
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:04,360
Bobby was an lnterpol informer

521
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:07,604
He's been with us
right from childhood

522
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:08,761
He'd have never betrayed us

523
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:14,038
A traitor is always part
of a gang and 'trusted'!

524
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:22,242
You went to collect the payment
How could you finalize a deal?

525
01:06:22,805 --> 01:06:26,400
l wanted to take the business
to another level, l did it for you

526
01:06:27,245 --> 01:06:30,157
Do you know the turn over
per year for arms smuggling?

527
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:35,957
Profit can be whatever
How can you decide for Abbasi?

528
01:06:36,485 --> 01:06:38,840
This is between
you and me, Abbasi!

529
01:06:39,605 --> 01:06:42,563
What's wrong in what Koti says?
What do you know about Dimitri?

530
01:06:43,725 --> 01:06:48,116
Dealing directly with him is hara-kiri!

531
01:06:48,525 --> 01:06:51,437
Abbasi, trust me

532
01:06:52,085 --> 01:06:59,480
l don't want to get into trouble
because of this, be careful

533
01:07:16,485 --> 01:07:17,201
Jasmine

534
01:07:19,405 --> 01:07:20,155
What are you up to?

535
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,199
What do you want?

536
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,676
Beat the hell out of him
Don't leave him

537
01:09:01,525 --> 01:09:04,801
Come and lie down beside me

538
01:09:07,125 --> 01:09:08,399
Are you leaving?

539
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:13,124
l know where you are off to

540
01:09:17,245 --> 01:09:22,558
l'll only be with you

541
01:09:23,845 --> 01:09:28,043
Till my last breath in my body
l'm the only one with you

542
01:09:31,845 --> 01:09:33,119
Abbasi, put David in his place

543
01:09:34,005 --> 01:09:36,155
My department is distraught
over David's behavior

544
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:39,438
ln a public place, he has hit
son of a minister Praveen Kumar

545
01:09:40,485 --> 01:09:44,603
lf l does anything further and
l take action, you'll be in a soup!

546
01:09:46,365 --> 01:09:47,844
Don't blame me then, okay?

547
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:58,474
l told you...you didn't listen
Here he comes sauntering in

548
01:09:58,765 --> 01:09:59,481
At least ask him now

549
01:09:59,685 --> 01:10:01,880
What fire are you kindling now, Koti?

550
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:07,436
Thanks to you, one who should
be saluting me is sitting with me

551
01:10:07,685 --> 01:10:08,595
...and issuing a warning!

552
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:10,801
What did l do?

553
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:15,874
- Why did you hit Satish?
- He misbehaved with Jasmine

554
01:10:16,565 --> 01:10:20,274
- Who is Jasmine?
- That's personal

555
01:10:21,245 --> 01:10:21,995
What is personal?

556
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,277
Praveen Kumar is
already mad with us

557
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:26,233
He has hit his son too

558
01:10:26,405 --> 01:10:28,919
Do you know whose
business this will affect?

559
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:29,962
'My business'?!

560
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:33,443
You have something else
on your mind

561
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:34,755
Be upfront

562
01:10:35,205 --> 01:10:38,083
l don't have hide and
talk to my henchman

563
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:41,995
l...who was your friend when
l saved Dimitri's consignment

564
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:44,113
...now do l seem
like your henchman?

565
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:49,038
You are crossing your limit, David

566
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:52,283
Abbasi, you are talking with
a pre determined conclusion

567
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:56,883
lf Billa be friends
he'll give even his life!

568
01:10:59,925 --> 01:11:02,200
lf we become your enemy
will you take our life?

569
01:11:02,565 --> 01:11:04,078
lf necessary
David will do so

570
01:11:05,245 --> 01:11:06,883
You don't exist without me

571
01:11:10,965 --> 01:11:12,239
There is a difference between
one who gets a job done...

572
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:16,836
...and one who wagers
his life, remember that!

573
01:11:49,975 --> 01:11:50,964
l've made up my mind

574
01:11:52,335 --> 01:11:54,803
Hereafter we'll ourselves
handle this drug business

575
01:11:58,175 --> 01:12:01,167
David, don't take any decision
when you are emotional

576
01:12:01,815 --> 01:12:02,452
lt will go wrong

577
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:05,734
This is when we should
make the right move

578
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:07,574
How much money
we've earned for them?

579
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:08,932
So what?

580
01:12:10,175 --> 01:12:11,654
He's in this business
for donkey's years

581
01:12:12,335 --> 01:12:13,563
Do you think
he'll let you thrive?

582
01:12:16,815 --> 01:12:18,214
- He won't
- Then?

583
01:12:20,255 --> 01:12:21,165
Neither should we give in!

584
01:12:28,655 --> 01:12:30,373
Okay, so what's the plan?

585
01:12:32,535 --> 01:12:36,448
During the carnival we kill
the Russian drug dealer

586
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:16,249
So...you want to start
business on your own?

587
01:13:18,055 --> 01:13:18,851
Smart move!

588
01:13:20,815 --> 01:13:23,124
But do you think you can
do it without Abbasi?

589
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:47,446
Good job!

590
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:59,014
Abbasi, your job is done
l'll call you back

591
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:05,494
Still alive
Kill him!

592
01:16:10,415 --> 01:16:11,370
l'm proud of you, Ram

593
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:12,731
Good job

594
01:16:18,415 --> 01:16:20,770
This is for you to go to Canada
just as you wanted!

595
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:23,806
This is for accepting my contract

596
01:16:25,255 --> 01:16:27,291
This is for completing
what you accepted

597
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:31,091
Thank you, Abbasi

598
01:16:32,535 --> 01:16:33,092
Tariq!

599
01:16:34,815 --> 01:16:36,214
Abbasi...what is this?

600
01:16:43,295 --> 01:16:44,967
What is the assurance that
what you did to David today...

601
01:16:45,575 --> 01:16:48,089
... tomorrow, you won't
do the same to me?!

602
01:17:19,055 --> 01:17:22,445
l told you right then, there is a difference
between one who gets a job done...

603
01:17:22,775 --> 01:17:25,573
...and one who wagers his life

604
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,931
Abbasi...you under-estimated David Billa!!

605
01:17:30,215 --> 01:17:30,886
Why?

606
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:37,133
Yes...l should have killed you myself

607
01:17:38,295 --> 01:17:39,808
My fault to have
trusted someone else

608
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:42,690
l won't apologize to you

609
01:17:43,415 --> 01:17:47,772
Shoot...
Shoooot!

610
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,935
David...he threatened
to kill me...that's why!

611
01:17:58,135 --> 01:17:59,488
To win we can kill 1000 enemies

612
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:00,971
Not wrong

613
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:05,246
But to let 1 traitor live is a huge blunder!

614
01:18:25,095 --> 01:18:30,215
The beast inside you deep
may decide to sleep...

615
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:36,449
lf it wakes up to walk
volcanoes will spark

616
01:18:37,615 --> 01:18:42,530
When dreams as feelings favor
beast within quivers with fervor

617
01:18:43,575 --> 01:18:47,932
Swallow you without a flutter
Gift you on a golden platter!

618
01:18:48,055 --> 01:18:52,492
Without smoking the bee
nectar is no guarantee

619
01:18:54,415 --> 01:18:58,567
A ball without a kick
won't bounce double quick

620
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:06,053
Only pain is balm to the soul
This is nature's untold rule

621
01:19:32,455 --> 01:19:37,813
lf you too live in hell
you become a beast as well

622
01:19:38,735 --> 01:19:43,650
Sacrifice a life to create terror
Repeatedly...another head to sever

623
01:19:44,855 --> 01:19:50,213
World is not round nor uniform
Blurred shadows have no form

624
01:19:50,975 --> 01:19:55,969
Break the norms of grammar
Knock at the roots and hammer

625
01:19:56,735 --> 01:20:02,014
No friend here to befriend
No foe to oppose or contend

626
01:20:02,855 --> 01:20:08,213
You are your own faithful friend
as well as your foe till the end

627
01:20:09,455 --> 01:20:15,246
Only pain is balm to the soul
This is nature's profound rule

628
01:20:44,815 --> 01:20:50,253
With the 1st blow, quiver with fear
With the next strike, buckle under

629
01:20:50,855 --> 01:20:55,883
lf he survives, hit again
Go for the jugular vein!

630
01:20:57,135 --> 01:21:02,368
You must die repeatedly
to reincarnate undauntedly

631
01:21:03,455 --> 01:21:08,165
Be alert even when asleep
with both eyes ready to leap

632
01:21:08,815 --> 01:21:14,173
You are your own restriction
Your goal is your destination

633
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:20,405
When you touch, pain sears high
lt aches, but can't feel the agony

634
01:21:21,695 --> 01:21:27,372
Only pain is balm to the soul
This is nature's enigmatic rule

635
01:21:30,295 --> 01:21:31,523
Don't shoot, sir

636
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:33,727
Please sir...please

637
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:39,565
Dimitri

638
01:21:43,895 --> 01:21:46,614
Welcome, my friend
Welcome to my world!

639
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:49,969
Arms consignment is ready

640
01:21:50,455 --> 01:21:51,092
As per our discussion...

641
01:21:51,575 --> 01:21:53,133
...you promised you would
help us cross the lndian waters

642
01:21:53,935 --> 01:21:55,766
Will do
As always

643
01:21:56,175 --> 01:21:58,291
lf you get it done
as you wanted...

644
01:21:58,775 --> 01:21:59,810
...we can work together

645
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:01,326
My share?

646
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,125
5%

647
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:18,651
30%

648
01:22:18,895 --> 01:22:23,093
Just because you replaced Abbasi,
don't assume you can dictate terms

649
01:22:23,415 --> 01:22:25,724
Without me, your consignment
will not even move one inch!

650
01:22:31,135 --> 01:22:31,806
30% ?

651
01:22:33,255 --> 01:22:35,894
My consignment will reach
Azania even without you!

652
01:23:09,295 --> 01:23:11,092
- Sir...your cheque?
- Sure

653
01:23:23,055 --> 01:23:24,124
- Thank you
- With pleasure

654
01:23:33,455 --> 01:23:39,564
Govt. does not have enough
money or schemes to help the poor

655
01:23:40,935 --> 01:23:47,124
David Billa has now donated to
our state welfare fund Rs 1 crore

656
01:23:49,855 --> 01:23:51,049
lf other rich industrialists follow suit

657
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:55,853
...they will feel good and
also be helpful to the Govt.

658
01:23:58,055 --> 01:24:02,253
l look forward to more
such contributions

659
01:24:03,135 --> 01:24:03,647
Thank you

660
01:24:10,615 --> 01:24:12,048
l am so happy
you graced this occasion

661
01:24:13,455 --> 01:24:19,212
Rs 1 crore for your state welfare fund
That's for the public

662
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:27,326
l am ready to give you whatever,
how much ever, whenever you want

663
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:34,814
lf you had come up the hard way
you won't be saying such things

664
01:24:38,135 --> 01:24:42,174
You were a gangster who became
a VlP the short cut, crooked way!

665
01:24:44,255 --> 01:24:49,454
Be it a business man or a millionaire...
...even a beggar has to work hard

666
01:24:50,615 --> 01:24:51,604
Money doesn't come easy, sir

667
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:54,290
You are the chief minister

668
01:24:55,135 --> 01:24:58,047
You serve the people
and our country

669
01:24:59,815 --> 01:25:05,333
But you still need gangster like me...
...to do your dirty job, sir!

670
01:25:08,695 --> 01:25:13,723
To handle your enemies, you need
the help of a gangster like me

671
01:25:18,335 --> 01:25:23,967
You've misunderstood me
This CM is not for sale

672
01:25:26,215 --> 01:25:27,284
My lntelligence wing
has been updating me

673
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:30,330
...all the necessary
information about you

674
01:25:30,935 --> 01:25:36,168
Just 1 evidence to pin you
You'll end up in prison

675
01:25:36,855 --> 01:25:37,367
Understand?

676
01:25:53,055 --> 01:25:56,968
Get the lntelligence Wing's file
on David Billa, it is very urgent

677
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:00,333
David...come
Let us go down

678
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:03,285
You go
l'll follow

679
01:26:04,255 --> 01:26:06,086
Come on, David
The guests are waiting

680
01:26:06,575 --> 01:26:08,964
Leave me alone for a while

681
01:26:10,775 --> 01:26:13,209
Why? What did the CM say?

682
01:26:31,295 --> 01:26:34,367
Sir, shall l deposit Billa's
cheque in the bank...or...?

683
01:26:35,855 --> 01:26:38,210
Send the file to my table
and the cheque to the bank

684
01:26:38,775 --> 01:26:39,571
Sure sir.

685
01:26:41,935 --> 01:26:42,447
Ranjit

686
01:27:56,535 --> 01:27:59,254
controversial businessman
and prime accused...

687
01:27:59,615 --> 01:28:01,173
David Billa has been arrested...

688
01:28:01,415 --> 01:28:03,406
...and taken into judicial
custody for 15 days

689
01:28:17,775 --> 01:28:26,854
He's expected to appear
in the court tomorrow

690
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,007
Regarding this,
the general secretary...

691
01:28:29,335 --> 01:28:32,088
Praveen Kumar of the ruling party
addressing a press meet...

692
01:28:32,335 --> 01:28:35,088
Regarding this murder,
l want proper action to be taken

693
01:28:35,815 --> 01:28:37,134
l want the culprit to be
punished accordingly

694
01:28:37,975 --> 01:28:41,047
ln the general body meeting, candidate for
the new chief minister will be nominated

695
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:44,885
l request the people
not to lose faith in us

696
01:28:45,735 --> 01:28:47,691
l humbly ask you
to maintain peace

697
01:28:52,135 --> 01:28:54,695
Mr Minister, no one
can match your talent

698
01:28:55,895 --> 01:28:56,611
What do you mean?

699
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:58,933
For Dimitri,
Billa should not be alive

700
01:28:59,695 --> 01:29:00,605
For you to
become Chief Minister...

701
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:01,963
...this CM should not be alive!

702
01:29:02,655 --> 01:29:03,883
You've finished 3 issues

703
01:29:05,495 --> 01:29:07,451
Here after Dimitri's
business in lndia...

704
01:29:08,215 --> 01:29:09,364
...will be handled only by us!

705
01:29:09,735 --> 01:29:10,611
Don't rejoice too soon

706
01:29:11,735 --> 01:29:14,647
Billa is not dead
He is only in jail

707
01:29:15,095 --> 01:29:16,164
He cannot come out

708
01:29:17,175 --> 01:29:18,608
He has applied for bail

709
01:29:18,815 --> 01:29:19,725
So what?

710
01:29:20,615 --> 01:29:23,652
There are many who witnessed him
threatening the Chief minister

711
01:29:24,455 --> 01:29:27,447
Besides that, the evidence
we concocted is strong

712
01:29:28,215 --> 01:29:29,045
How can he come out?

713
01:29:29,855 --> 01:29:31,208
lf beyond all this,
he comes out...

714
01:29:31,975 --> 01:29:35,012
...then us taking this money
from you will be meaningless!

715
01:29:40,255 --> 01:29:43,611
Your Honor! l pray this court
to grant bail for my client...

716
01:29:43,895 --> 01:29:44,850
Mr David Billa

717
01:29:53,935 --> 01:29:55,163
l object, Your Honor

718
01:29:55,855 --> 01:29:58,130
The accused David Billa has
said he was drunk that night...

719
01:29:58,855 --> 01:30:03,451
...he threatened the Chief minister to
join hands with him in smuggling activities

720
01:30:04,175 --> 01:30:08,726
Press and media have reported threats
made by him to the Chief Minister

721
01:30:13,095 --> 01:30:14,926
lf granted bail, chances of...

722
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:21,848
...concrete evidence being
tampered by him are high

723
01:30:23,895 --> 01:30:27,729
l request the Honorable court
to deny bail to David Billa

724
01:30:31,575 --> 01:30:36,524
l find undue haste has been shown
by the police in arresting the defendant...

725
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,084
...without proper evidence

726
01:30:38,695 --> 01:30:43,530
Until such evidence is produced
to the court l grant him bail...

727
01:30:43,975 --> 01:30:45,727
...with a third party
surety of five lakhs

728
01:30:48,415 --> 01:30:49,291
The court is adjourned

729
01:31:03,295 --> 01:31:04,728
Praveen Kumar has utilized
your emotional speech...

730
01:31:04,935 --> 01:31:07,654
...to the chief minister, to his advantage!

731
01:31:08,295 --> 01:31:09,284
l thought l wouldn't
even be granted bail

732
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:10,891
How did you manage?

733
01:31:11,535 --> 01:31:16,086
l followed your 'pearl of wisdom'
Others fear, our power!

734
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:49,931
Do understand l already have
the 1/3 majority to become CM

735
01:31:51,095 --> 01:31:53,893
How can l give a minister's post
to every Tom, Dick and Harry?

736
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,733
There's no one else
more suitable for this post

737
01:31:56,535 --> 01:31:58,207
Why? No gratitude?

738
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:04,771
ls that why you were
waiting for so many years?

739
01:32:13,815 --> 01:32:15,214
Your desire to
become Chief minister

740
01:32:15,975 --> 01:32:18,808
Your conspiracies
All that is politics

741
01:32:20,335 --> 01:32:24,613
But sending me to jail
was height of stupidity

742
01:32:25,015 --> 01:32:26,004
Are you intending
to kill me now?

743
01:32:28,655 --> 01:32:31,931
To be my friend,
no qualification required

744
01:32:33,455 --> 01:32:36,572
But you need capability
to be my enemy

745
01:32:39,775 --> 01:32:40,764
You do not possess
those credentials

746
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:46,765
lf l had wanted, l could have
killed you when l was in jail

747
01:32:49,655 --> 01:32:52,692
Don't talk nonsense, Bllla
lf anything happens to me

748
01:32:53,495 --> 01:32:56,407
...there are more than 100000
people to give their lives for me

749
01:32:57,735 --> 01:33:02,092
People will vote for you
Not sacrifice their lives!!!

750
01:33:07,855 --> 01:33:12,975
Mr Praveen Kumar...David Billa
will not step into your territory

751
01:33:13,775 --> 01:33:17,734
You...do not trespass
into David Billa's space

752
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:33,288
Koti, Billa just gave me a warning!

753
01:33:34,655 --> 01:33:37,692
l want to hear the news
that he is dead

754
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:02,645
How are you, Jasmine?

755
01:34:06,775 --> 01:34:08,891
l'm back
Why are you crying now?

756
01:34:09,215 --> 01:34:11,570
l was praying that
you should come back soon

757
01:34:16,575 --> 01:34:19,169
They said they will kill you.

758
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:21,900
The Minister and Dmitry were
together somehow.

759
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:26,101
They were both clearly
helping Billa escape.

760
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
- Leo?
- I've Coty here for you.

761
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:37,800
Hello, Coty. Yes.
Yes.

762
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,800
Minister Pravin Kumar
wants to talk to you.

763
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:46,174
Hello, Dimitriy.
I'm here to help you.

764
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,324
My heart nearly stopped, you know!

765
01:34:51,255 --> 01:34:53,644
Jasmine, you get
scared too easily

766
01:34:56,375 --> 01:35:00,050
David,
l didn't expect you back so soon

767
01:35:03,855 --> 01:35:05,527
- How are you?
- l'm fine

768
01:35:06,695 --> 01:35:09,687
Whatever it takes, before my ship
reaches lndian waters...

769
01:35:09,975 --> 01:35:11,567
Don't worry
l'll take care of everything

770
01:35:11,855 --> 01:35:12,810
Billa will not be alive

771
01:35:12,895 --> 01:35:14,851
l don't care how much it costs

772
01:35:20,735 --> 01:35:23,249
Jasmine, you go home
l'll come later

773
01:35:32,815 --> 01:35:36,171
l knew you'd send me away

774
01:36:02,815 --> 01:36:05,727
David, l think l disturbed you
in one of your happy moments

775
01:36:06,615 --> 01:36:07,365
Who is this?

776
01:36:07,615 --> 01:36:08,764
You don't need to know who l am

777
01:36:09,175 --> 01:36:10,244
lf you don't come
to the place l tell you

778
01:36:10,775 --> 01:36:12,493
...Jasmine will die for you!

779
01:36:21,095 --> 01:36:21,845
Koti...

780
01:37:19,775 --> 01:37:20,890
Look over there...car

781
01:38:06,975 --> 01:38:07,691
Hello?

782
01:38:08,095 --> 01:38:09,892
Sameera, start immediately

783
01:38:10,775 --> 01:38:11,685
lf you are in the house
your life is in danger

784
01:38:12,135 --> 01:38:14,126
Danger?
What happened?

785
01:38:14,975 --> 01:38:18,968
First come to the place
l ask you to and take Jasmine

786
01:38:19,735 --> 01:38:22,807
Jasmine?
Where should l come?

787
01:38:24,975 --> 01:38:25,691
St Mary's church...

788
01:38:30,215 --> 01:38:32,251
Jasmine, you shouldn't
be in lndia any longer

789
01:38:32,855 --> 01:38:35,369
l want you to go to Malaysia
l've made all the arrangements

790
01:38:36,055 --> 01:38:40,048
You want to send me away
and then live it up with her, right?

791
01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:41,930
l'm doing this for your good

792
01:38:47,775 --> 01:38:48,412
Hello?

793
01:38:54,415 --> 01:38:55,370
l'll be with you only

794
01:38:55,735 --> 01:38:57,612
lf you want,
send her to Malaysia!

795
01:38:58,135 --> 01:38:59,170
l'm concerned about you

796
01:39:00,775 --> 01:39:01,764
Why drag her into
our conversation?

797
01:39:02,455 --> 01:39:03,171
l didn't drag her

798
01:39:03,655 --> 01:39:05,850
You called and asked her to come
l won't go anywhere without you

799
01:39:06,935 --> 01:39:07,890
Please understand

800
01:39:10,535 --> 01:39:11,524
l don't want any harm to
befall you because of me

801
01:39:13,055 --> 01:39:15,330
Sameera will come now
Go with her to safety

802
01:39:17,455 --> 01:39:18,365
Okay, you want me to go

803
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:21,888
Fine, l'll go where you'll
never be able to see me!

804
01:39:53,735 --> 01:39:54,531
David!

805
01:39:56,975 --> 01:39:57,964
David!

806
01:40:16,215 --> 01:40:17,773
How many times l've warned you
not to cross swords with me?

807
01:40:19,975 --> 01:40:22,489
Your thought
you were over smart?!

808
01:40:23,535 --> 01:40:25,127
You made Dimitri your enemy

809
01:40:26,335 --> 01:40:27,893
We ganged up together

810
01:40:29,295 --> 01:40:30,364
Now do you realize...?

811
01:40:31,615 --> 01:40:32,764
Your time's up!

812
01:40:43,175 --> 01:40:46,884
Did you ever
anticipate such an end?

813
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:56,688
Dai! My life...every day...
every moment...

814
01:40:57,255 --> 01:41:01,931
...every second has
been chiseled by ME!

815
01:41:06,975 --> 01:41:07,612
Kill him!

816
01:41:10,095 --> 01:41:11,050
Don't spare him!

817
01:41:37,735 --> 01:41:38,611
Kill that scoundrel!

818
01:43:46,335 --> 01:43:50,010
What 'is' has now become 'was'
Thoughts of you are at a pause

819
01:43:50,535 --> 01:43:54,084
My love for you l can't hide
You took me on a sky-ride

820
01:44:14,335 --> 01:44:18,044
l love you to eternity
Why did you cheat on me?

821
01:44:18,655 --> 01:44:21,613
My tears have dried, therefore...
l won't call you honey, anymore

822
01:44:22,335 --> 01:44:24,371
l don't want to be with you anymore

823
01:44:24,615 --> 01:44:26,446
lf l loved you before, now no encore

824
01:44:26,775 --> 01:44:29,573
Deluge of tears, now stopped

825
01:44:30,335 --> 01:44:34,294
Memories of you l've cropped

826
01:44:34,655 --> 01:44:36,247
What 'is' has now become 'was'

827
01:44:36,415 --> 01:44:38,053
What 'is' has now become 'was'
Thoughts of you are at a pause

828
01:44:38,335 --> 01:44:42,294
Love has passed me by
Clouds are no longer in the sky

829
01:44:42,695 --> 01:44:45,653
Fly fast to me, waiting for you...
Why do l still love you so true?

830
01:45:06,015 --> 01:45:08,734
My friends, it's time to talk business

831
01:45:16,615 --> 01:45:19,812
l know you are interested
to see what you've purchased

832
01:45:33,775 --> 01:45:36,448
Though the value of the weapons l've made
for you is only 500 million dollars...

833
01:45:37,095 --> 01:45:40,849
the power these weapons
will give you is invaluable.

834
01:45:48,935 --> 01:45:49,924
Our chief is happy.

835
01:45:50,215 --> 01:45:52,251
But he wants to know if his
shipment will arrive on time.

836
01:45:52,775 --> 01:45:54,128
Your weapons are now.

837
01:45:54,409 --> 01:46:00,000
The ship carrying them will
depart from the port in a few hours.

838
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:06,050
lt will sail through Japan, lndonesia,
Thailand and lndian waters.

839
01:46:06,575 --> 01:46:08,088
l guarantee you it will arrive on time.

840
01:46:08,735 --> 01:46:11,044
Let's see a live view of your
weapon's leaving my factory.

841
01:47:11,775 --> 01:47:13,333
Dimitri, what the hell is this?

842
01:47:18,495 --> 01:47:22,010
l made a mistake.
l believed him.

843
01:47:27,775 --> 01:47:31,245
l also made another mistake
l didn't believe in him.

844
01:47:59,015 --> 01:48:01,210
David...magnet

845
01:48:59,855 --> 01:49:02,528
l promise you.
I will reach you in one hour.

846
01:49:23,335 --> 01:49:24,006
Leo

847
01:51:03,415 --> 01:51:05,167
Land the helicopter

848
01:51:33,815 --> 01:51:35,453
Come out

849
01:51:57,335 --> 01:52:01,123
The train should reach
the port at any cost

850
01:52:26,895 --> 01:52:30,171
Follow the train

851
01:56:27,695 --> 01:56:29,651
So...you finished
what you intended

852
01:56:34,895 --> 01:56:35,884
This is the Beginning...

853
01:58:33,455 --> 01:58:36,811
Gang...gang...gangster,
here comes the monster

854
01:58:37,135 --> 01:58:40,571
Gang...gang...gangster,
you will surrender

855
01:58:40,895 --> 01:58:46,731
Diligently, he chiseled his story
He signed in darkness his destiny

856
01:58:48,575 --> 01:58:54,332
He kissed goodbye to pain
ln pain he found pleasure again

857
01:59:03,615 --> 01:59:06,891
Don to be dreaded...
dread to get beheaded!

858
01:59:07,415 --> 01:59:10,725
The mantle David Billa dons
is the best Don of all Dons

859
01:59:11,175 --> 01:59:14,372
Don to be dreaded...
dread to get shredded!

860
01:59:14,855 --> 01:59:18,052
Billa shares the fury
of a lion in a frenzy

861
01:59:18,335 --> 01:59:21,247
Give your way...your way
to this gangster

862
01:59:22,175 --> 01:59:24,973
Give your way...your way
to this monster

863
01:59:26,175 --> 01:59:29,247
Even atop a volcano
he'll stake his claim

864
01:59:29,735 --> 01:59:36,971
People all over respect
and revere his very name

865
01:59:37,255 --> 01:59:40,691
Even God of death Yama
he'll con into a dreadful dilemma

866
01:59:41,095 --> 01:59:44,690
Don to be dreaded...
dread to get beheaded!

867
01:59:44,975 --> 01:59:48,524
The mantle David Billa dons
is the best Don of all Dons

868
01:59:48,855 --> 01:59:52,052
Don to be dreaded...
dread to get shredded!

869
01:59:52,615 --> 01:59:55,732
Billa shares the fury
of a lion in a frenzy

870
01:59:56,415 --> 02:00:00,010
Gang...gang...gangster,
here comes the monster

871
02:00:00,375 --> 02:00:03,890
Gang...gang...gangster,
you will surrender
