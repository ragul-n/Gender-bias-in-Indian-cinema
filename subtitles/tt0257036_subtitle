00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,520
'REST HOUSE'

2
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Keeper.

3
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,040
Keeper.

4
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Keeper!

5
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,960
Welcome..

6
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,240
I'm Professor Lakshmi.

7
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,800
This is Sister Sophia.

8
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
These are my children.

9
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,760
Did you give birth to all of them?

10
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,760
Nonsense.
They are my students.

11
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,280
We are here
for botanical research. - Oh!

12
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,560
I got the letter from the college.

13
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,440
Who are you?

14
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm Ellen Poulose

15
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,960
from Kalluvettankuzhi.

16
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,480
I'm the cook and keeper here.

17
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,600
Keep quiet.

18
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,400
Where is our room?

19
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
We just have two halls here.

20
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,440
One hall is over there.

21
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
Another one is over here.

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,880
We have vacated this one for you.

23
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,840
Come on..

24
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,080
Are there any men staying here?

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,720
No. There are no men here.

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,080
What about you?

27
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Don't count me as a man.

28
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Quiet.

29
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,840
Well, what about the food?

30
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,960
I'll arrange everything.

31
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,520
One more thing.
- Yes?

32
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,920
Men should not be allowed here
without our permission.

33
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,960
No one will come to stay here.

34
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,960
Okay.
- I'll arrange your coffee.

35
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,920
Well, girls,
make yourself comfortable.

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,280
A peaceful place.
There are no disturbances.

37
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,480
Beautiful sight.

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,440
We came during the right time.

39
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,560
"Oh, spring!"

40
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,120
"Spread everywhere!"

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,360
"Oh, spring!
Spread everywhere!"

42
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,240
"The colourful flowers."

43
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,400
"Oh, dear heart!"

44
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,080
"Embrace the beauty."

45
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,800
"Oh, spring!"

46
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,680
"The blossomed gardens!"

47
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,520
"The fruitful trees!"

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480

49
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280

51
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
"of the mountain."

52
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,920
"The smiling sky above."

53
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,600
"The frozen earth below."

54
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,880
"The smiling sky above."

55
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,520
"The frozen earth below."

56
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,720
"Oh, spring!"

57
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,320
"The frosty meadow."

58
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,080
"The green paddy fields!"

59
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,960
"The frosty meadow."

60
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,960
"The green paddy fields!"

61
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,880
"The clouds that made"

62
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,960
"the flowers bloom."

63
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,280
"The bright sky above."

64
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,800
"The awakening earth below."

65
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,360
"The bright sky above."

66
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,040
"The awakening earth below."

67
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,120
"Oh, spring!
Spread everywhere!"

68
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,920
"The colourful flowers."

69
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,000
"Oh, dear heart!"

70
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,640
"Embrace the beauty."

71
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,160
"Oh, spring!"

72
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,400
Good morning.

73
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,120
Good morning..
- Good morning..

74
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,720
Lead kindly light.
- Hail Mary..

75
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,640
Left. Right. Left.

76
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,920
Right. Left. Right. Left.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,960
Right. About turn.

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,240
Left. Right. Left. Right. Left.

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,320
Right. Left.. Right..
About turn.

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,640
Left.. Right..

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,040
Left..

83
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,760
Left. Right. Left.

84
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,080
Don't look at the girls.
Look forward.

85
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,640
Left.. Right..

86
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,880
Left..
About turn.

87
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,440
Left.. Right..

88
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Left.. Right..
Team halt!

89
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
Left. Right.

90
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,560
You got it all wrong
because of the girls.

91
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
Raghu.

92
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,480
Jamal.

93
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,080
Appu. Why are you carrying
a cigarette pack?

94
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Left.. Right..
About turn.

95
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,880
Right.. Left.. Right..

96
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,360
Left.. Right..

97
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,040
Left.. Right..

98
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,840
Don't look at the girls.
Look forward.

99
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,840
Left.. Right..
Don't look at the girls.

100
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,560
Left.. Right..
Don't look back.

101
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,960
Left.. Right..

102
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,920
Hey!

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,080
Didn't you say that
there are no men here? - Yes.

104
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Are they girls who
are screaming outside?

105
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, no!
They are smart college boys.

106
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,680
Didn't I tell you not to let
any men stay here?

107
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
This is not my private property.

108
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,520
This is a government quarters.
Anyone is allowed here.

109
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,200
Tell them to look for another place
as girls are staying here.

110
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
What if they ask me to tell
you the same thing?

111
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,760
Left.. Right..
They got it wrong.

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,400
Left.. Right..

113
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,840
Left.. Right..

114
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,560
Please stop.
- What do you want?

115
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,640
Left.. Right..
Tell me.

116
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,120
Left.. Right..

117
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,720
Only women are staying here.
- We are here too.

118
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,840
Left.. Right..
- Be serious.

119
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,920
I'm Professor Lakshmi
from My Ladies College, Madras.

120
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,720
Left.. Right..

121
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm Professor Major P.K. Das
of National College of Madras.

122
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,280
Left. Right.
About turn.

123
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,080
Nonsense.
About turn.

124
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,520
Come on!

125
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Go inside.

126
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
Please.

127
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm a celibate.
I don't talk to women.

128
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,080
Then why did you come to a place
where only women are staying?

129
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,720
My students and I came here
for botanical research.

130
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,800
We reserved it before you.

131
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,840
It would be better if you look
for another place.

132
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,520
We reserved it too.

133
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,640
So you can look for another place.

134
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,160
We won't stay
in the same place with men.

135
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,560
We have some discipline.

136
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
Mind you. My students have
military discipline. Remember!

137
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,960
You came here
on purpose to disturb us. - Hey!

138
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,480
Be careful.
I hate women.

139
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,960
I hate men too.

140
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,600
I don't care about your hatred.

141
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
Women are evil. They are
the cause for all destruction.

142
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,480
Shut up!
Men are frauds.

143
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,400
You shut up!

144
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,320
Remember that Eve was made
out of a rib from Adam.

145
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,360
Nonsense.
I don't want to listen to this.

146
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,280
Will you leave this place or not?
- Absolutely impossible.

147
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,760
Run..

148
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,720
Oh, no!

149
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,600
What is this?
This is a gent's washroom.

150
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
This is our washroom!
Let me go. - Why are you here?

151
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,120
Leave!
- Don't touch me! - Oh, no!

152
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,040
What is this nonsense?
What is this nonsense!

153
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,080
This is my room.

154
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,240
Look carefully. This is my room.
- No. It's mine. - Get out!

155
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,040
Oh, no! My Saree.
- Is it yours? - Yes.

156
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,080
We can't live like this anymore.

157
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,560
We should leave this place soon.

158
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,040
I can't stay here
with these lunatics anymore.

159
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,960
Get ready.

160
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,400
He is the superintendent
engineer I mentioned to you.

161
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm here as the chairman
of an investigation committee.

162
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,960
There is a ruin nearby.

163
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,800
Some people claim
that it's a temple.

164
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
Others say that it belongs
to an estate owner.

165
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,920
There are people
fighting over it too.

166
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,120
That is why the government
sent him here.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,840
Can you do us a favour?

168
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Can you shift the men
from the rest house?

169
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,160
Sorry.
That is a public place.

170
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,800
It is not reserved for women.

171
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,280
Then can you arrange
another place for us?

172
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,960
They have no manners.

173
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,440
Uncultured men.

174
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,400
Let's just discuss our issue.

175
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,520
We'll shift
if they are staying there.

176
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,360
Another place for us..

177
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,960
The mansion of the estate owner,
Smith, is vacant.

178
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,200
You can ask him.

179
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
He'll definitely agree
if you ask him.

180
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,600
His family doesn't stay
there either.

181
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,560
Then you can take them
to the mansion. - Okay.

182
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,080
Thanks.
I'll see you later.

183
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,720
Poulose?
- Yes.

184
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,880
How are the girls
who came with them?

185
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,400
They are like doves!
Ten girls! Ten beauties!

186
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,160
I'll be here for a few more days.

187
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,560
I'll arrange a program
if I get a chance.

188
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,800
We lost a golden chance.

189
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,040
Ten beautiful girls!

190
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,040
The girls were beautiful
like pearls.

191
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,240
Will we ever meet such beautiful
girls on this hill top? - No.

192
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,920
It was a God-given opportunity.

193
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,240
But Professor Lakshmi
came in between.

194
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,800
She is the villain
on this hill top.

195
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,080
We could have had our chance.
But your uncle ruined it.

196
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,880
Hey, let's try one last time.

197
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,760
Do whatever you want

198
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,120
but those girls shouldn't
leave this place.

199
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,480
Let's meet our professor.

200
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,400
Oh, no!

201
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,720
Get up.
You just have to come with me.

202
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,720
I'll come.

203
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,400
But I'll run away if he gets angry.

204
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,360
'The atmosphere is getting warmer.'

205
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,080
Oh! It might be because
of the lack of rain.

206
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,080
No. Maybe it's because
of the men here.

207
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,200
Hey, it's the political atmosphere.

208
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,760
'Lovers committed suicide.'

209
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,760
Good news.

210
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,320
Pack your bags and get
ready to leave.

211
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,200
Where are we going?

212
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,400
We'll arrange your stay
in a nearby mansion.

213
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
Don't we have
enough facilities here?

214
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,200
Just obey my orders!
Get ready!

215
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Sir?
- Yes. What's the matter?

216
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,560
The professor and the students
from next door are leaving.

217
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,240
You mind your own business.

218
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,240
It's an insult to us if
they leave because of us.

219
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,120
If we can adjust something..

220
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
No adjustment for ladies.

221
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
Oh, God! Leave from here!

222
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,080
At least for the sake of humanity..

223
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,920
Such a humanity
will ruin your life.

224
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
That's what women will do to you.

225
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,680
Do you understand?
You may leave.

226
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,920
Sir, I..
- Get out!

227
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,040
Raghu.

228
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,360
You are a good singer, aren't you?

229
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,400
Yes, sir.

230
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,320
You are not allowed to sing
till we leave this rest house.

231
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,280
Why?

232
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,960
Cows, babies and snakes
will get attracted to songs.

233
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,160
But we don't have them
in the rest house.

234
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,960
We do.
In the next door.

235
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,560
There are 11 small snakes
and a big snake.

236
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,840
Are you talking about the professor
and the students? - Yes.

237
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,640
Be careful.
You can go.

238
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,480
He won't let anyone stay here.

239
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,320
We just have to stay
for seven days.

240
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,760
They are here with the special
request from the engineer.

241
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,920
Mr. Poulose.
- Yes.

242
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,960
After his brother,
Alexander, passed away

243
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,960
he never lets anyone stay here.

244
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,680
Can we at least meet him?

245
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,560
Yes. I'll call him.

246
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,320
He is selling the estate
and going back to London.

247
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,480
He is a good man.
- Yes.

248
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,560
He'll agree if you ask him.

249
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,080
Is that him in the picture?

250
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,080
No. That is his elder
brother's picture.

251
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
His name is Alexander.

252
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,080
The rumour is that his manager
killed him. - He is coming.

253
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,240
Good morning.
- Good morning.

254
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,240
Good morning.
- Good morning.

255
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,320
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

256
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,920
Our superintendent recommended
her and ten girls

257
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,320
to stay here

258
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,840
because the rest house
is full of boys.

259
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,920
And they want your
permission for it.

260
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,000
All right..
You can have my outhouse.

261
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Manager.
- Yes, sir.

262
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,640
You'll make the facilities.
- Yes.

263
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,880
Thank you very much.

264
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,040
Your face is very familiar.

265
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
Is your name Mary?

266
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,240
The daughter of late Thomas.
- Yes.

267
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,320
Clean the outhouse, Meenakshi.

268
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,920
How does he know you?

269
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,120
He knows my father.

270
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,120
Maybe that's why he agreed.

271
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,520
Let's go.

272
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,280
Manager, we'll go now.
We'll come later. - Okay.

273
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,960
How is it going?

274
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,200
Nuisance! Haven't I told you not
to come here for temple affairs?

275
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,280
We won't stay idle if you say

276
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,160
that he owns our century
old temple.

277
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
Remember that he is a rich man
before you go against him.

278
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,440
We won't leave anyone
in peace if they try

279
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,880
to mess with us
with their money.

280
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,440
That place is for him to build
a monument for his late brother.

281
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
Do you have to destroy
our temple for that?

282
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,520
What is all this?

283
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,080
Hey, the matter is not so simple.

284
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
That is our religious place.

285
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,640
If you build a monument there..

286
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,480
I'll do whatever I like.

287
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,960
Get out!

288
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,760
We'll see what will happen!

289
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,760
We'll break the limbs of anyone
who comes near the temple.

290
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,480
Get out!
- Leave..

291
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,200
Come and see what will happen!
- Leave.

292
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,520
Manager.
- Sir.

293
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,480
Get all these rowdies out of here.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,520
You should talk.
- Raghu, you should tell.

295
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,640
Let Balan speak. - They shouldn't
leave, that's all. - Tell them.

296
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,880
They shouldn't leave.

297
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,760
We have a request.

298
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,440
You shouldn't leave
this place because of us.

299
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,640
Oh, you might be planning
to spend time with us. - No.

300
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,480
It's our right to live
together with women.

301
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,320
It is needed for our youth.

302
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,720
It sounds like you are here
to get us married.

303
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,880
We are ready for that too.

304
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
We are also ready to divorce you
after the wedding night.

305
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,040
Don't try to trap us
because we are girls.

306
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Hey, we won't try to trap you.

307
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Leave it.

308
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,960
We'll leave this place.
You can stay here.

309
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,760
Thank you so much!
You can leave.

310
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,240
We belong to the same species.

311
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,920
Why should we fight
for such a small issue?

312
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,360
The political scenario of the
country will change in the future.

313
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,200
Let's unite to save
the world from extinction.

314
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,960
Don't try to trick us.

315
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,680
We have decided to leave.

316
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,400
We won't spend any more
time with such scums.

317
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,280
Be careful about what you say.
- Hey. - Don't say it again.

318
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,480
What if we do?

319
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,880
Well, if you do, we'll forgive you.

320
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,640
You need luck for that too.

321
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,240
Oh, God! Please make them change
their decision about leaving.

322
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
Amen!

323
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,600
Anyway, I don't like
to stay in his mansion.

324
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,760
Aren't you acquaintances?

325
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,920
Yes. My father was the manager
of his brother, Mr. Alexander.

326
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,280
Oh, no!
You shouldn't stay there.

327
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,360
Why?
- People say it is haunted.

328
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
Really?

329
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Is that so?

330
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,200
Anyway, row the boat.

331
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,520
Thomas.

332
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,320
Please tell me
where the treasure is.

333
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,880
Do you know why
you are still alive? - Yes, I know.

334
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,920
Then tell us where
the treasure is.

335
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,040
We'll give you a share.
You can live in luxury.

336
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,320
That is public property.

337
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,560
It belongs to God.

338
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,320
It is a sin to steal it.

339
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,280
To hell with your ideals!

340
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,240
Come on! Tell me!
- Hey!

341
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,760
You are a cruel man!

342
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,240
Didn't you kill your brother
because he didn't reveal it?

343
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Keep that in mind.

344
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,480
He has kept you alive
because he cares about you.

345
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,640
I know he wants to get
the information from me.

346
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,920
Where is the treasure?
Tell me where it is.

347
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,760
I was the manager for Mr. Alexander
for a couple of decades.

348
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,320
Unfortunately,
we found the treasure

349
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,800
while we were clearing
the area around the temple.

350
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,960
And Mr. Alexander told that it
belongs to an old temple.

351
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
That's the truth.

352
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,800
He told me that as Christians,
we are supposed to return it

353
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,120
to the rightful owner.

354
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,480
But you didn't listen to him.

355
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,360
Everything will be fine
after we get the money.

356
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,440
God will punish you for killing
your brother for other's property.

357
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,160
I don't care about your God.

358
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,480
Don't you want to see
your daughter?

359
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,360
Where is she?
Where is my daughter, Mary?

360
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Didn't you lock me in this dungeon
when you killed my boss?

361
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,560
Where did my daughter
go after that?

362
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,560
How did she live?

363
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,520
Who will tell me the truth?

364
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,440
She went to Madras
when she couldn't find you.

365
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,240
She joined a nunnery.

366
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,920
Now she is here as a nun
with a bunch of girls.

367
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,400
Is she here?

368
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,280
I want to see my daughter.

369
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,960
I want to see my daughter
before I die.

370
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,360
Okay, we'll arrange it.

371
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,040
Go inside.

372
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Aren't we leaving?

373
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,280
We won't leave for now. We'll stay
here till we get another place.

374
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,280
Go inside. We'll meet
the superintendent again.

375
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,320
Come on, Sister.

376
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,680
"Such an insult!"

377
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,040
"Such an embarrassment!"

378
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,160
"Oh, uptown ladies! Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

379
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,880
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

380
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,160
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

381
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,400
"Oh, uptown ladies! Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

382
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,560
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

383
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,760
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

384
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,600
"Let's open the knot."

385
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,920
"Let's spread the mat."

386
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,360
"Let's open the knot."

387
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,360
"Let's spread the mat."

388
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,800
"We are there for you."

389
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,960
"We are there for you."

390
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,280
"We are there for you."

391
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,440
"We are there for you."

392
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,720
"Oh, uptown ladies! Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

393
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,880
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

394
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,960
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

395
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

396
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,800
"Oh, talkative sparrows"

397
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
"stuck in"

398
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,120
"the glorious castle."

399
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
"Oh, talkative sparrows"

400
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,600
"stuck in"

401
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,200
"the glorious castle."

402
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,880
"Oh, talkative sparrows"

403
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
"stuck in"

404
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,720
"the glorious castle."

405
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,000
"The army"

406
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,400
"of women"

407
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,320
"with a failed mission."

408
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,640
"The army of women."

409
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,400
"The army"

410
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,640
"of women.."

411
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,960
"With a failed mission."

412
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,520
"The army of women."

413
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,960
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

414
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,160
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

415
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,120
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

416
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

417
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,080
"With a funny haircut"

418
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,680
"and a sleeveless dress."

419
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,240
"Oh, college beauty!"

420
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,920
"With a funny haircut"

421
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,560
"and a sleeveless dress."

422
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,080
"Oh, college beauty!"

423
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,680
"Even if you are a celestial
beauty or a film star.."

424
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,600
"Even if you are a celestial
beauty or a film star"

425
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,680
"a girl will always
be just a girl."

426
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,800
"A girl will always
be just a senseless girl."

427
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,560
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

428
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,440
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

429
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,360
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

430
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,360
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

431
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,640
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

432
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,520
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

433
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,480
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

434
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,640
"Oh, uptown ladies!"

435
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,320
"Let's open the knot."

436
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,440
"Let's spread the mat."

437
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,640
"Let's open the knot."

438
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,600
"Let's spread the mat."

439
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
"We are there for you."

440
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
"We are there for you."

441
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,040
"We are there for you."

442
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,120
"We are there for you."

443
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,120
"We are there for you."

444
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,960
"We are there for you."

445
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,760
"We are there for you."

446
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,600
"We are there for you."

447
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,400
"We are there for you."

448
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,400
"We are there for you."

449
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,320
Aren't you ashamed?

450
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Why did you come here?

451
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,360
Did you come here
to stare at women? - No, sir.

452
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,800
No, sir!
What do you mean by that?

453
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,800
What business do you
have with these girls?

454
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,800
No business, sir!
- No business! Nonsense.

455
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,960
I'll cancel the camp
if you repeat it again.

456
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,200
Get ready for the bus.

457
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,640
Yes, sir.

458
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,400
Were you here too?

459
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,120
I was saved from my uncle by luck.

460
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,920
But we'll lose our chance
if we are not careful.

461
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,160
He hurt my hand
with his stick in anger.

462
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,560
Leave it..
I'll catch it.

463
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,560
I will..
I will catch it.

464
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,440
Go to your place.
- Yes, sir.

465
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,520
S-Sir, there is a new butterfly.

466
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,400
You can't catch the butterfly
beyond this line. Go to your place.

467
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,520
Yes!

468
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,320
Miss.

469
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,200
There is a new herb.

470
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,720
Really?

471
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,320
Here.

472
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
You can't study the plants
beyond this line.

473
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,880
Go to your place.

474
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,800
Boys.

475
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,920
All right.
Quick march.

476
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,400
Boys!
About turn.

477
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,200
'Smoking is injurious to health.'

478
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,600
Take the boat,
we need to go to the other side.

479
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,120
The boat is under repair.
- Did the tyre get punctured?

480
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,080
To hell with your repair!
Take it.

481
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,040
The boat will sink.
- Then you may get out. We'll go.

482
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,360
Don't you've to repair now?
- It's his trick. Let's get in.

483
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,920
That's it. - I told you
not to get in.. - Keep quiet.

484
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,280
Catch her. - Don't leave her.
- Stop. - Stop there.

485
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,320
I asked you to stop.

486
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,320
Tell the truth.
Where are you going?

487
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,920
Don't play any tricks.
Tell us the truth.

488
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,800
Or else, we'll call the police.

489
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,400
I'm the servant
at the foreigner's home.

490
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,400
I think it must belong
to some old temple.

491
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,160
I've got things like these
a couple of times.

492
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,320
The jewels and artefacts
from our country

493
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,360
are bought by the foreigners
at a huge price.

494
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,400
I think the smuggling group
is somewhere near.

495
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,120
That's why the police
are guarding this place.

496
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,200
We found this piece
of paper along with this idol.

497
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,480
'Sending through captain.'

498
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,200
'Await further. X.'

499
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,560
We can understand

500
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,960
that things like
these are sent abroad

501
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,800
through this captain.

502
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,960
We can know the truth if we catch
the guys who were there

503
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,320
with the girl who died.

504
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,000
We'll catch them for sure.
- Thank you for your help.

505
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,280
So let us leave.

506
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,320
Don't make us the culprits
when you file the case.

507
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,560
Goodbye.

508
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
I don't know anything
about her death.

509
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,240
Someone must have killed her
to take revenge.

510
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,560
Wasn't she the maid here?
- Yes.

511
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,880
She's been here for a long time.
- When did she leave last day?

512
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,560
L-Like always. At night.

513
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,960
Did she have any connection with
the smugglers? - We don't know.

514
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,040
There are some secrets behind it.

515
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,640
Okay. I'm putting some policemen
to watch this place.

516
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,880
That's good.
- Thank you, sir.

517
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,600
Hey, Lakshmi.
- What is it?

518
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,520
I don't know Hindi, Lakshmi.

519
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
You may learn it.
- You learn it first.

520
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,480
Why should just we learn it? You
should learn our language too.

521
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,880
Then only will we be united.
We are one nation.

522
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,320
Talk to me.
I'll teach you.

523
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,840
I don't understand
your language at all.

524
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,720
What?
- I'm in love with you.

525
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,200
Do you love me?
- Yes. Strong love.

526
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,880
All India love.
My dear.

527
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,080
What is this?
- I was clearing my doubt.

528
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,680
Nonsense. - I'm sorry.
I took the wrong plant.

529
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,720
I asked you to go away.
- I'm going. - Come on.

530
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,880
Hey.
What is this?

531
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,800
What is it? - What are you
looking at so carefully?

532
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,040
Don't talk.. Look.. - Tell me
the matter. - Look. - Did you see?

533
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,200
It's nice..
- What?

534
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,040
Enjoy it, Balan. Look.

535
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,160
If it goes like this, the Saree
will fall off in a matter of time.

536
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,600
The three musketeers
are checking us out.

537
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,680
Come on.

538
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,880
What?
- Nothing.

539
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Who all are there at home?
- Why?

540
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,640
I thought of coming.
- Is there anything special?

541
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm alone.
- So am I.

542
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,640
So, the route is clear.

543
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,320
Read this letter.

544
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Ma'am..
- Oh, no, don't do it.

545
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,400
Don't stay here anymore.
Let's go.

546
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,960
Wait..
- One doubt.

547
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,600
Have you nailed
this Saree on your hip?

548
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,880
Why?
- It's not coming off. - Is it?

549
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,720
Are you waiting for the Saree
to fall off?

550
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,280
We were saying,
a piece of cloth would be enough

551
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,520
if the trend goes like this.
- Yes..

552
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,920
You don't need to worry.
Let's go.

553
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,680
Hello. Good morning.

554
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,560
Good morning.
- The answer for my..

555
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,200
Aren't you in love with me?

556
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,680
Not love, that is..
- Which means, real love.

557
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,640
I'll be coming to your home,
Kamaladevi.

558
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,040
Don't try to steal
a beggar's meal.

559
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,880
Panchali had five husbands.
Did you know?

560
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,240
Then I'll get the fat professor.
- Okay.

561
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,440
Stay here.

562
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,800
You're a bad omen.

563
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,960
If we stay near this cemetery

564
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,040
the ghosts will kill us.
Do you know?

565
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,960
Is it?
Let's see then.

566
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,080
Haven't you heard
about Alexander's ghost

567
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,280
killing people, Pachu Pillai?

568
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,880
Ghosts are a lie.

569
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,560
How many people have died here?

570
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,400
Moreover, it's Friday.

571
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,080
The ghost will come
around 1 o'clock.

572
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,800
We'll arrest that ghost today.
- You may do it.

573
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm not coming. I'm leaving.

574
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,760
Oh, God.

575
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Why are you screaming?
- Ghost.. - Where? - Ghost.

576
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,560
He killed him and ran away.

577
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,760
Did you see the ghost

578
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,360
killing the constable?
- I just saw it, sir.

579
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,080
I was lying on the ground
when I came back to my senses.

580
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,480
People have been complaining
about the ghost.

581
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,280
We can't handle the ghosts.

582
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,000
My children will lose their father.

583
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,800
Don't we need to know the truth?
- It's the ghost of Alexander.

584
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,000
He comes out of his grave
on his death anniversary.

585
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,280
And kills everyone he meets
till the next new moon.

586
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,200
It's our duty to end it.

587
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
But there is no law for it.

588
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,240
Only humans can be caught.
Can we arrest a ghost?

589
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,480
We must do it if needed.

590
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,600
Today I'll come for the patrol too.
- Yes.

591
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,920
The locals are saying, it's better
not to go out for 15 days. - Damn!

592
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,720
Keeper..

593
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,520
Keeper..
- Nonsense! - Nonsense.

594
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,200
Ask them to leave.
- Yes.

595
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,600
Tell them, it's not
their dad's property. - Yes.

596
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,280
Don't abuse. - Hey, I'm hungry.
Serve the food. - Yes.

597
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,800
It's better for you to leave
than to fight.

598
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,200
Okay, we'll have a truce.

599
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,400
We can eat together.
- Ask your wife.

600
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,520
I asked you since I don't
have a wife. - Shut up!

601
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,600
You shut up!

602
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,400
Hey, don't serve it to them.

603
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,240
We came here first.

604
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,160
It's your duty to serve food
to the ones who come. Keep it here.

605
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,120
Okay, I'll keep it here.

606
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,160
Do as you wish.
- Come on. Eat.

607
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,720
Don't touch it.

608
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,360
We're not your servants
to eat your leftovers. - Let's see.

609
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,120
Don't leave..
- Leave it..

610
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,520
Oh, God.

611
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,440
Don't think that you've won.
- Girls always lose. Remember it.

612
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,000
We'll defeat you.
- Are you in for a bet? - Yes.

613
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,320
We won't live as women if we don't
take revenge on you. Come on.

614
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,440
Goal! Very good, boys.
Well done.

615
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,200
Timeout.

616
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,920
What is this?

617
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,400
Oh, God.

618
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,720
Never mind.

619
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,280
Useless!

620
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,360
Foul..

621
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,000
My God.

622
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,920
Shame.. You're not my students.

623
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,320
Aren't you ashamed?

624
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,000
You got lost in their smile
and lost your dignity.

625
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,600
You're not my students.

626
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,320
Sir..
- You may go. Don't come to me.

627
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,560
Be ready to leave tomorrow
at 6.a.m. Get ready.

628
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,960
Oh, God.

629
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,080
Let bygones be bygones.
Forgive us, this time.

630
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,240
I don't want your explanation.

631
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,200
Evaporate! Extinguish!

632
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,080
They've lost.
- Oh, God.

633
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,080
The professor has lost.
- Oh, God.

634
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,200
The captain has lost.
- Oh, God.

635
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Take it.
- The embarrassment.

636
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,480
Take it.
- Captain.

637
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,000
"Such an insult!"

638
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,640
"Such an embarrassment!"

639
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,800
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

640
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,960
"The tuskers who've stumbled."

641
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,000
Goodbye..

642
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,840
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

643
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,240
"The tuskers who've stumbled."

644
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,720
"The tuskers who've stumbled.."

645
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,680
"Pack up."

646
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,880
"Say goodbye."

647
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,160
"Pack up.
Say goodbye."

648
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,680
"We'll get you the tickets.
- For the bus."

649
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,240
"We'll get you the tickets.
- For the bus."

650
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,520
"We'll get you the tickets.
- For the bus."

651
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,040
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

652
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,320
"The tuskers who've stumbled."

653
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,960
"The tuskers who've stumbled.."

654
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,960
"Wearing trousers.
- Wearing trousers."

655
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,440
"The mascots of bad luck.
- The mascots."

656
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,800
"Wearing trousers.
The mascots of bad luck."

657
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,280
"The Romeo of the college
has lost."

658
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,640
"Lost..
Lost miserably."

659
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,600
"Oh, God.."

660
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,720
"Oh, God.
The professor is fainting."

661
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,920
"Oh, God. The captain
is lost in love."

662
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,160
"Lost in love.."

663
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,360
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

664
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,600
"The tuskers who've stumbled."

665
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,040
"The tuskers who've stumbled.."

666
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,720
"The spikes and the tummy."

667
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,120
"What can it do on the court?"

668
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,360
"The spikes and the tummy."

669
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,520
"What can it do on the court?"

670
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,200
"The scoreboard is empty."

671
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,600
"The scoreboard is empty."

672
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,400
"How many zeroes did we put?
- Oh, God."

673
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,880
"How many zeroes did we put?"

674
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,320
"Oh, God.."

675
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,600
"The males are devotees."

676
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,800
"They're the saints"

677
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,400
"who worship the zeroes."

678
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,720
"Fake saints."

679
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,520
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

680
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,640
"The tuskers who've stumbled."

681
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,040
"The tuskers who've stumbled.."

682
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,200
"The ones wearing the glasses"

683
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,200
"the ones with a fake moustache"

684
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,040
"who came to play have lost."

685
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,120
"They failed.. Miserably."

686
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,040
"Oh, God. - Oh, God.
- Oh, God. - Oh, God."

687
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,120
"Oh, God.
The professor is fainting."

688
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,520
"Oh, God. The captain
is lost in love."

689
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,720
"Lost in love.."

690
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,400
"Such an insult!
Such an embarrassment!"

691
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,480
"The tuskers who've stumbled."

692
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,760
"The tuskers who've stumbled.."

693
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,520
"Pack up."

694
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,800
"Say goodbye."

695
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,520
"Pack up.
Say goodbye."

696
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,880
"We'll get you the tickets.
- For the bus."

697
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,160
"We'll get you the tickets.
- For the bus."

698
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,200
"We'll get you the tickets.
- For the bus."

699
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,240
"We'll get you the tickets.
- For the bus."

700
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,640
It was like selling
the sun to buy a candle.

701
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,960
We let go of our dignity
to talk to the girls.

702
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,440
What happened in the end?

703
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,880
We lost! - Don't worry.
I saw an English film.

704
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,240
We'll teach them a lesson
in the same way. - How?

705
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,960
The hero is coming with a revolver.

706
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,680
Get out!
Everybody join in.

707
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
I've got a gang.

708
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,800
Don't move.
All right.

709
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,280
Come on.

710
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,880
She's coming with the money.
- And then the police came.

711
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,000
Congratulation.
Wonderful.

712
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,640
I've never seen such
a game in my lifetime.

713
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,720
Thank you.

714
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,120
He was talking about
your game all the way.

715
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,320
I love games.

716
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,440
Especially, if girls are playing.

717
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,560
So sweet!
Don't you have a wife?

718
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,880
It's hard to count the
number of wives he has.

719
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,200
Did you come to get us?
- No..

720
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,640
Nothing like that.
It's only sportsman spirit.

721
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,760
And if you need anything,
tell me.

722
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,880
Thank you for your help.

723
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,920
Poulose.
- Sir. - She played great.

724
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,080
Don't stay so. You must
participate in world games.

725
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,280
Just give her a push.
She'll achieve many things.

726
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,360
I'm ready to do all I can.

727
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,680
So, may we go to our room?
- Yes.

728
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,920
See you later.

729
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,280
Bye..

730
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,240
Hello, Superintendent.
- Hello.. - Hello. - Hello.

731
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,520
When did you come? - Just now.
- Do you want tea or coffee?

732
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,040
Nothing. - Have something.
- No, thank you.

733
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:16,240
Saying bye like this is not
good for health.

734
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,040
Have you started to play
with the head?

735
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,160
He is a perfect gentleman.

736
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,840
He doesn't talk with girls.

737
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,800
You've misunderstood me.

738
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,240
Superintendent.

739
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,280
Be careful while dealing
with college students.

740
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,560
Hey, can I take him out?

741
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,640
Please don't do it in here.

742
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,480
All right. Even talking to you
won't suit me. - Is it?

743
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,560
Then..
- Don't go. Stay.

744
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,800
You won't have your legs to go back
if you come here again.

745
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,160
Oh, God. Thief..
- Oh, God. Thief..

746
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,560
They took all our ornaments.

747
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,280
He took my necklace too.
- Oh, God.

748
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,360
Remove it quickly.
- Make it fast.

749
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,800
Pour that ink on your face. They'll
think that it's blood. - Idea.

750
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,560
We'll call the police
in the morning.

751
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,640
Go to sleep, everybody.

752
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,560
Oh, God.
- Oh, God. - Oh, God. - Oh, God.

753
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,880
What is this?
Get up.

754
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,600
Were these ornaments
stolen from here?

755
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,200
Oh, God. Yes.
- Have a look.

756
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,400
The tribals took it from us.
- Those tribals..

757
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,840
They came into our room too. They
didn't quit, so even we didn't.

758
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,560
Then a group fight.
- What a fight! - Group fight.

759
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,040
They beat us to a pulp.

760
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,280
What a fight? - What a fight?
- Water..

761
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,960
We followed him.

762
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,840
A big fat guy.
- Beat us to a pulp.

763
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,160
Every hit felt like a 100 pound.

764
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,280
There was a skinny guy
holding a revolver with him.

765
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,960
Anyway, we got thrashed.

766
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,800
Did you get your ornaments? - Yes.
- Did you see this?

767
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,000
Blood..
- Tomorrow..

768
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,440
We're going to consult a doctor
tomorrow. Drink it.

769
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,280
Thank you for your help.
- Enough. Give it to him.

770
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,600
Give it to him.

771
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,440
Hey, Raghu. - Yes.
Keep your hands here.

772
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,400
Is my chest beaten to a pulp?
- Hey.

773
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,880
It's a bit bad.

774
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,600
Leave it. They must not

775
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,040
be harmed when they
are staying with us.

776
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,840
You suffered a lot for us.

777
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
We won't forget this help, ever.

778
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Can you do us a favour?
- We're obliged to do anything.

779
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,800
Our professor has asked us to leave

780
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,360
in the morning
since we lost the match.

781
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,720
If you come

782
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,960
and tell our professor

783
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,160
about what we did tonight

784
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
maybe, he'll let us stay.

785
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,720
He called us undignified
and spineless.

786
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,800
And scolded us.

787
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,880
Please come with us
and talk to him.

788
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,920
We'll be relieved.

789
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,360
Do it if you can.
Otherwise, it's okay..

790
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,960
May God bless you. - Bless you.
- Bless you. - Wait.

791
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,760
We'll tell him.
What do you say?

792
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,560
Okay. You may go.

793
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,520
Wait. Where are you all going?

794
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,320
Just a couple of you may go.
Leela, Sathi, Latha.

795
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,280
We'll go.

796
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,720
All of you, go to sleep.

797
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,160
Come in.

798
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,520
Did you get me?

799
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,400
Poor girls.
They got scared.

800
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,480
I didn't expect them too.

801
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,680
No, why are you in this..

802
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,440
Because you wore it.

803
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,600
It's not manly to scare girls

804
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,720
at midnight by wearing
a tribal dress.

805
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,800
Now, didn't you courageous
guys get scared?

806
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,240
Don't hide anything from me.
I'll find it out.

807
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,040
I won't do it ever again.

808
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,920
I've to give that dress back.
- Take it..

809
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,680
You are always working, Poulose.

810
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,240
How well built was he?
Now, he's all skin and bones.

811
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,960
We're lucky that he is our keeper.
- Yes.

812
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,440
You're flattering me.

813
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,360
We are always frank.

814
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,840
Poulose. - Yes.
- We're thirsty.

815
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,320
Don't you see it?
- Tell me what you want.

816
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,360
Do you want cold water or curd?
I'll give you anything.

817
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,360
It's the thirst of our mind.

818
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,320
The girls are hitting on us.

819
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,600
Yes. Everybody is chained here.

820
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,720
Listen, Oulo.. Poulose.

821
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,480
We need to open our hearts to them.

822
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,560
Is it all?
I will take care of it.

823
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,440
Poulose, then..

824
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,600
Give this letter
to my friend, Leela.

825
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,560
This is for my sweetheart, Sathi.

826
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,960
This is for my heroine, Latha.
- Latha.

827
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,480
Don't you need something to drink?

828
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,240
Here, take it.

829
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,960
I don't need in instalments.
Give it as a whole amount.

830
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,520
Do you have to say it? We'll give
you. God bless. Let's go. - Yes.

831
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,920
Bring it quickly, Poulose.
- Coming.

832
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,680
Didn't I come here first?

833
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,720
Don't you need it hot?
I'll heat it and bring.

834
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,680
I need this. - Don't eat it.
I'll bring you another one.

835
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,280
No issues. You can have it.
- Pour the Chutney.

836
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,440
'Darling.'

837
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,800
'I don't know how
to express my love.'

838
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,520
'We must meet, today evening.'

839
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,280
'I'll be waiting.'

840
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,840
'From your dearest.'

841
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,440
What is this?

842
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,320
Hey, tell me the truth.
Who gave you this letter?

843
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,120
Someone might have mixed it
with the dough, ma'am.

844
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,200
I'll dismiss you if you tell lies.
- Oh, God.

845
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,840
He must've done it.

846
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,360
Leela, Latha, Sathi.

847
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,320
Do you know anything about this?

848
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,840
We.. We know nothing, ma'am.
- Okay.

849
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,840
Then I must put an end to this.

850
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,600
Keeper. - Yes.
- Follow me. - Yes.

851
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:05,960
Sir.

852
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,720
Yes.
- A letter for you.

853
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,160
Ma'am sent this for you.

854
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,320
For me?
- Yes.

855
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,160
'Darling.'

856
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,120
'I don't know how
to express my love.'

857
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,960
'Let's meet each other
if you like me too.'

858
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,680
'I'll wait for you.'

859
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:25,960
'Yours..'

860
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,440
What nonsense!

861
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,960
Prof. Lakshmi loves me!

862
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,240
She wants to meet me!

863
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,360
Where is she!

864
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,080
How dare you write
a love letter to me?

865
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,520
Divine Love!
Don't you have shame?

866
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,200
Stop it! I am not here
to love a crazy person like you.

867
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,920
Then, what is this? - This is a
trick played by your students.

868
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,680
My students wrote a love letter!

869
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,120
To whom?
- To my girls.

870
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,560
Your boys kept it
in my girls' food.

871
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,640
Wait.

872
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,880
Latest trick in the history
of love!

873
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,680
Love letter in food!

874
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,880
Punish them immediately
for their prank.

875
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,600
Confucius said that even a mother
and son

876
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,120
shouldn't stay together alone.

877
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,480
The ambiance gives way to emotion.

878
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,760
Don't profess.

879
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,120
Your boys should never
write letters to my girls.

880
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,200
That's all.

881
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,160
Your girls should never provoke
my boys to write it too.

882
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,200
That's all.

883
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,360
Lord Krishna!

884
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,320
Your pranks!

885
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,520
"Oh, river Yamuna.."

886
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,720
"Oh, river Yamuna.."

887
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,960
"The symbol of love.."

888
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,760
"Where is Lord Krishna?"

889
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,440
"Where is Lord Krishna?"

890
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,720
"Where is that handsome lover?"

891
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,520
"Where is that handsome lover?"

892
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,880
'Where is the charming
flute player?"

893
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,640
"Where is Lord Krishna?"

894
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,920
"In the serene night
drenched in moonlight"

895
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,760
"I made a floral bed for you."

896
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,960
"In the serene night
drenched in moonlight"

897
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:33,040
"I made a floral bed for you.."

898
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:39,240
"After heeding your heartfelt
invitation"

899
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,280
"how will I resist my arrival?"

900
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:49,160
"After heeding your heartfelt
invitation"

901
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,640
"how will I resist my arrival?"

902
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,240
"How will I resist my arrival?"

903
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:04,360
"Here I am, my dear Radha."

904
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:09,000
"Here I am."

905
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,200
"When I desired to hear
the tune of your flute"

906
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,000
"the gentle breeze teased me"

907
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,360
"and made fun of me."

908
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:37,640
"In the eternal ocean of your love"

909
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,240
"how can I not swim?"

910
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,680
"How can I not swim?"

911
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,920
"Here I am, my dear Radha."

912
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,720
"Here I am, Radha."

913
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,400
Lord Krishna!

914
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,520
Lord Krishna!

915
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,120
What happened?

916
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,280
Nothing.

917
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,760
What happened?

918
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,960
Nothing.

919
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,880
I-I had a nightmare.

920
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,360
You might be scared.

921
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,640
Pray to God and sleep.

922
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,800
Good night.
- Good night..

923
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,960
Who came into your dreams?

924
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,840
Her boyfriend, who else!

925
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,080
Oh!
You and your truths!

926
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,560
Stop teasing.

927
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,680
All of you have a crush on someone.

928
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,880
This is nothing new.

929
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,720
Every woman needs a man.

930
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,640
It is hard to live without a mate.

931
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,520
That is true.

932
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,920
Life without a companion
will be boring.

933
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,360
I don't have a boyfriend or dreams.

934
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,680
Lord Krishna!

935
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,240
Gently.

936
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,960
They will come running

937
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,520
if they hear us.

938
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,000
Oh, no!

939
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,240
What happened?

940
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,400
Ghost!
- Where? - There!

941
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,800
Run!

942
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,280
Where is it?
It disappeared.

943
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,040
It might have gone to the cemetery.

944
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,680
What are you doing here?

945
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,640
We were following a ghost.

946
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,480
No!
It will kill you.

947
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,560
Leave, kids.

948
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,760
We will catch the ghost.

949
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,640
Thalikotta Temple..
- Belongs to us..

950
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,440
Give us the right..
- To freedom of religion..

951
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,880
To hell with..
- Mr. Smith..

952
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,960
Don't create a scene
or we will arrest you.

953
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,760
This temple belongs to us.

954
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,720
Now it is owned by Mr. Smith.

955
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,640
We will protest against it.

956
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,160
We will kill the traitors.

957
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,120
Hail..
- Thalikotta Temple..

958
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,480
You can't enter until
the commission's order is here.

959
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,600
We will enter.

960
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,480
We will retrieve our rights
no matter what.

961
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,680
Come on.

962
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,400
You can't go in.
- We will.

963
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,520
What is this?
- Stop.

964
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,280
Who are you?

965
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:41,280
Count us as a few of the patriotic
students of this country.

966
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,440
This is none of your business.

967
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,920
We have the right to know
what is happening in our country.

968
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,320
You should fight
against this atrocity.

969
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,960
We will fight against atrocities.
What is the matter?

970
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,960
This property belongs
to Thalikotta Temple since ages.

971
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,800
Now, a foreigner came
and acquired them all.

972
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,280
Why does he need this temple?

973
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,720
This temple was ruined
during Tipu Sultan's attack.

974
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,160
People believe

975
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,280
that priceless treasures

976
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,800
golden statues and gems
are buried in here.

977
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,600
He might be planning

978
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,600
to excavate the treasure and sell
it in the foreign market.

979
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,960
That is the truth.

980
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,520
You are young.

981
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,760
Help us solve this issue.

982
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,440
Mr. Smith bribes and influences

983
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,880
whoever comes to investigate
about this.

984
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,440
Have you not mentioned
it to the leaders?

985
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,280
There are many political parties
in here as in the cities.

986
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,080
One party opposes the other.

987
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,880
Will anything happen then?

988
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,920
Our country is like this because
of the rivalry between parties.

989
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,720
We too have parties.

990
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,720
But we unite
for the public interest.

991
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,600
Okay.
We will find a solution for this.

992
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,560
Inspector.

993
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,920
Please don't do anything
until then.

994
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,520
Hail..
- Thalikotta Temple..

995
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,160
Hail..
- Thalikotta Temple..

996
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,760
Cheers.
- Cheers.

997
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,720
The report came in our favour
because of your kindness.

998
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,600
Keep that in mind.

999
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,920
'Drinking alcohol is
injurious to health.

1000
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,320
I'll give you a good present.
- Thank you.

1001
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,040
We will pay you
the amount we agreed.

1002
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,200
I trust him.

1003
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,800
My word is my deed.

1004
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,440
I am well aware of it.

1005
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,440
I'll meet you again.

1006
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,880
What are you doing here?

1007
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,840
He is here to drink
since he is thirsty.

1008
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,320
He is an honest officer.

1009
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,840
He might be here

1010
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,240
to get his commission for preparing
the report in favour of Mr. Smith.

1011
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,720
Who are you to ask?

1012
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,680
I'll do what I like.

1013
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,680
Hey,
I don't think this will be easy.

1014
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,160
Who are these people?

1015
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,200
Manager.
- Yes.

1016
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,640
Why did you let these people
come in without my permission?

1017
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,120
Why are you here?

1018
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,440
To be honest

1019
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,880
we are a bit badass.

1020
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,120
So it is better to give the temple

1021
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,880
back to the devotees
without a fight.

1022
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,800
I won't give my property.

1023
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,280
He is going back
to England after building

1024
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,960
a memorial for his brother there.

1025
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,800
If you don't heed to us

1026
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,800
you will have to erect
one for yourself too.

1027
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,760
Mr. Smith.

1028
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,880
Don't create unnecessary troubles.

1029
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,640
I don't want your damn advice.

1030
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,680
If you give us a drink,
we will also say

1031
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,280
'we don't give a damn either'.
- Shut up!

1032
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,920
You shut up..
- Stop it.

1033
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,800
Manager.

1034
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,440
We won't leave until you give
the temple back to the devotees.

1035
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,440
We will arrange
another place to build

1036
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,960
a peaceful resting
place for his brother.

1037
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,560
It was Mr. Alexander's last
wish to build it there.

1038
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,280
Our wish is to return
the temple back to the people.

1039
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,440
I'll give them a place and
Rs. 50,000 for the temple.

1040
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,880
They don't want your charity.

1041
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,400
Return the temple to the people.

1042
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,240
I will not part with my property.

1043
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,680
You can go.
- Oh!

1044
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,880
I don't think he will return
in one piece.

1045
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:00,880
Get out, you rowdies.

1046
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,680
Shut up!
Do you know who we are?

1047
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,440
Sir, please don't fight.

1048
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,240
Please. - We won't leave
until the property

1049
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,600
is given back.

1050
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,680
Come on.

1051
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,160
Your students are trying
to interfere in the temple issue

1052
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,280
for their profit.
- No..

1053
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,680
You see, youth should come
forward to fight such issues.

1054
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,640
The senior
politicians' worn out attitude

1055
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,360
of not letting go of their
power is the main reason

1056
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:31,560
for political polarity
and disparity of our country.

1057
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,520
That is politics.

1058
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,040
Advise your students
not to interfere in this issue.

1059
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,040
That's impossible.

1060
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,600
They will do what is right.

1061
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,640
They have the right.

1062
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,520
But it is not fair.

1063
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,160
That's what you think.

1064
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,200
But according to the conscience,
it is justifiable.

1065
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,440
Mister.

1066
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,080
We can do what is right
to our conscience.

1067
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,920
They are here for a botanical tour.

1068
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,800
Don't interfere
and create problems.

1069
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,240
I never taught them to stand
idle at the time of injustice.

1070
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,840
Students are the rising
future of the society.

1071
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,040
All right.

1072
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:09,960
Don't worry.

1073
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,720
This is a love tree.

1074
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,120
Here it is. Collect
the specimens you need.

1075
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,760
Why are you doing this?

1076
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,800
I thought you might
at least touch me.

1077
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,400
Stop flirting and do your job.

1078
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,200
What is the fun in that?

1079
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,880
Right now, my study subjects
are women and love.

1080
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,040
Your means are crooked.

1081
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,680
The end justifies the means.

1082
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,240
Isn't that a political quote?

1083
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,640
If necessary, I'll create

1084
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,440
a coalition committee
and fight for my love.

1085
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,840
Then I am walking
out of this meeting.

1086
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,240
Oh, no!
- Throw it away

1087
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,440
and think about us.

1088
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,680
What about us?

1089
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,800
The normal things everyone does.

1090
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,320
Tell me what it is.

1091
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,560
In a deserted place

1092
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,360
a beautiful lady is sitting alone.

1093
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,440
The young man approaches.

1094
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:10,920
What will you do?

1095
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,200
I'll walk away.

1096
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,720
Like this

1097
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,160
he touches you.

1098
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,480
Someone will see.

1099
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,680
Fear

1100
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,240
is the first sign of love.

1101
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:22,840
And

1102
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,600
he takes her in his arms..

1103
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,960
What are you doing?

1104
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,120
You are beautiful.

1105
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,680
Wonderful.

1106
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,240
Sathi!

1107
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,640
Hamsa.
- Yes.

1108
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,600
My heart is aching.

1109
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,040
Why?

1110
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,840
We will depart after a few days.

1111
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,360
Let's live here.

1112
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:54,840
Give me a word.

1113
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,200
Let's live here till the flood.

1114
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,440
No, we will die in the flood.

1115
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,360
Let's live together

1116
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,600
and die..

1117
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,520
I will come along, Raghavan.

1118
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,560
I will come to your house,
Hamsavalli.

1119
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,240
Oh, so both of you love me,
don't you?

1120
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,400
Shridharan.

1121
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,800
Don't compete with your own friend.

1122
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,640
Don't fall for that smile.

1123
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,840
He is very tricky.

1124
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:19,960
Beware.

1125
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,960
Look who is saying!

1126
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,440
Get lost!
You ruined everything.

1127
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,240
Stupid.

1128
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:56,240
"I got the most precious pearl."

1129
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,440
"I got the most precious pearl."

1130
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:18,760
"I got the most valuable gem."

1131
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,040
"I got dreams for you to colour"

1132
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,960
"the beautiful decor of my heart."

1133
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,320
"I got the most precious pearl."

1134
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,520
"How long have I searched for you?"

1135
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,720
"How long have my eyes
waited for you?"

1136
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,840
"How long have I searched for you?"

1137
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,840
"How long have my eyes
waited for you?"

1138
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,160
"With the smile
sparkling in your eyes"

1139
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,160
"a new feeling
bloomed in my heart."

1140
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:31,040
"With the smile
sparkling in your eyes"

1141
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,960
"a new feeling
bloomed in my heart."

1142
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:41,560
"I got the most precious pearl."

1143
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,560
"I got the most valuable gem."

1144
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,680
"I got dreams for you to colour"

1145
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,600
"the beautiful decor of my heart."

1146
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,960
"I got the most precious pearl."

1147
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,960
"I have reached the door
of your heart."

1148
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,000
"Fill me with the tune
of your heart."

1149
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,120
"I have reached the door
of your heart."

1150
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:44,440
"Fill me with the tune
of your heart."

1151
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,680
"My heart beat is eager
to sync with yours."

1152
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,560
"Open the door and let me in."

1153
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:02,600
"My heart beat is eager
to sync with yours."

1154
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,720
"Open the door and let me in."

1155
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:12,760
"I got the most precious pearl."

1156
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,800
"I got the most valuable gem."

1157
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,880
"I got dreams for you to colour"

1158
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,840
"the beautiful decor of my heart."

1159
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,960
"I got the most precious pearl."

1160
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:43,160
"I got the most precious pearl."

1161
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,120
Sister.

1162
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,520
Your father, Thomas,
is still alive.

1163
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,760
Is it true?

1164
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,680
Where is he?

1165
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,040
He is hiding after killing
Mr. Alexander.

1166
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,520
I am sure that my father
will never do it.

1167
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,400
We are hiding him
from the police, Sister.

1168
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,600
He will tell me the truth
once we meet.

1169
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,320
I will arrange it.

1170
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,680
We will leave within a few days.

1171
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,680
I will arrange it today
if possible, and inform you.

1172
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,840
I'll be waiting.

1173
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,120
Keep this as a secret.

1174
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,000
Have you collected the specimens
from the places we've visited?

1175
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,120
Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

1176
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,640
Tomorrow onwards, let's study
about underwater plants.

1177
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,480
There is a lake nearby.

1178
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,800
There are different types
of old underwater plants in it.

1179
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,640
Few girls are here to meet you.

1180
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:38,880
Who are they?

1181
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,440
Praise the Lord.

1182
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,200
Now and forever.

1183
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,680
Who are you?

1184
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,040
We came to the Kurisummoottil
Church to attend a festival.

1185
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,240
We missed our last bus.

1186
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,160
What else?
Don't eat your nails!

1187
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,040
What is the use of living

1188
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,280
if someone harms these girls
while I travel

1189
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,280
with them?

1190
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:09,480
So, we will sleep here tonight
and leave tomorrow morning.

1191
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,480
We don't have the facility for it.

1192
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,160
We will adjust here.

1193
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,560
They said

1194
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,520
that some wicked boys
live next door.

1195
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,560
That is true.

1196
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,040
They are crooked.

1197
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,960
Let them stay here tonight.

1198
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,480
Where will they go at night?

1199
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:25,560
Okay.
Leela.

1200
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,120
Let them stay here tonight.

1201
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,320
Come on, Sister.

1202
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,120
God!
Now I am at peace.

1203
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,360
Ma'am.

1204
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,640
Are they your daughters?

1205
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,760
Yes, dear.

1206
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,120
She is my first born.

1207
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,480
Annakutty.

1208
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,040
She is the middle one.
Marykutty.

1209
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:44,960
Where is the other?

1210
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,040
Here.

1211
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,040
She is the last one.
Allekutty.

1212
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,280
Her friends call her a stick
since she is thin.

1213
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,680
Are you studying?

1214
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,560
I was studying B.Sc.

1215
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,680
I dropped out.

1216
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,080
Mother is in search of a groom
to marry me off.

1217
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,360
What is your name?
- Leela.

1218
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,160
What a pretty face!

1219
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,360
Right, Mother?

1220
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,640
Then marry her.

1221
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,040
I don't mind.

1222
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,080
I want a dress like this, Mother.

1223
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,360
What is your name?
- Sathi.

1224
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,160
I like this girl very much.

1225
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,320
Where are you from?
- Ernakulam.

1226
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,920
Their father had business
in Ernakulam.

1227
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,240
Where is he?

1228
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,040
It is a tragedy

1229
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,280
like Moses', dear.

1230
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,080
We had rubber plantations.

1231
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,960
One day,
my husband climbed the tree

1232
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,200
to tapper it.

1233
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,000
He fell from the tree

1234
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,600
and died.

1235
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,280
Ma'am.

1236
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,520
Don't cry.

1237
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,080
How can I not?

1238
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,960
Three of them had only one father.

1239
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,480
It is fate.

1240
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,160
We are here tonight

1241
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,360
to check our fate.

1242
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,480
Hey!

1243
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,520
Control.

1244
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,680
Or their teachers will kick us out.

1245
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,920
Seems like she is naughty.

1246
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,600
They all are naughty.

1247
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,800
They are not like they look.

1248
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,880
She, the middle one

1249
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,040
is the most disobedient.
- Mother!

1250
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,600
Dear, dance
and entertain us.

1251
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,840
I don't know how to dance.

1252
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,680
Don't you dance, Sathi?

1253
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,760
She knows very well.

1254
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:44,400
Dear, we can't come here again.
Do it.

1255
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,000
I will do it.

1256
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,600
Do it.

1257
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,080
As we have decided,
let's start for the lake at 6 a.m.

1258
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,720
I have arranged everything.

1259
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,160
What about the food
for the lady and her girls?

1260
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,400
Poulose will take care of it.

1261
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,240
We won't let you go
until we teach you a lesson.

1262
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,200
Stop it.

1263
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,480
Don't forget that we are boys.

1264
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,960
Don't be so proud.

1265
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,280
Boys and girls should
have some adjustments.

1266
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,720
We did this when you didn't adjust.

1267
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,160
Come on, boys.

1268
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,400
Good night.
- Good night.

1269
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,640
Sister..

1270
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:33,720
Keeper..

1271
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,760
Mr. Das!

1272
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,240
Don't enter into a bachelor's
room at night.

1273
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,120
I came here because of your boys.

1274
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,880
They came to our room
disguised as women.

1275
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:49,880
Take it easy.

1276
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,560
They might be joking.

1277
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,480
I will complain to the police
if this repeats.

1278
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,880
Ma'am, don't threaten me.

1279
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,840
Mind you.
I am an ex-military officer.

1280
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,080
Major P.K. Das.

1281
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,120
We will show you.
- Yes.

1282
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,120
Let them disguise
themselves as men.

1283
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,560
Absurd!
- Shut up!

1284
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,240
Ma'am.

1285
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,240
The foreigner has sent
an invitation. - What's the matter?

1286
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,040
Today is his brother's
death anniversary.

1287
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,680
He has invited us
to the memorial service.

1288
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,560
Should we go?

1289
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,600
It is for a dead person.

1290
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,480
You should go.

1291
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,720
That is not right.

1292
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,000
We should go together.

1293
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,840
Okay.

1294
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,520
As you wish.

1295
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,280
This is the report by the officer
who inspected this case.

1296
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,080
'This land is a part
of Mr. Smith's estate.'

1297
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,360
'Earlier, this was a rest house.'

1298
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,040
'The claim of a temple is a false
testimony by the villagers.'

1299
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,280
'The government approves
that this property'

1300
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:55,320
'belongs to Mr. Smith after
studying all the records.'

1301
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,880
Trespassing is a punishable
offence.

1302
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,400
We are against this report.

1303
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,440
He bribed the officer
to fabricate the report.

1304
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,480
If you dare to nullify our rights

1305
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,520
remember that we will riot.

1306
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,720
Tell us what we should do.

1307
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,520
Inspector.
- We are ready to die.

1308
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,880
We believe that this is a temple
and it belongs to them.

1309
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,360
The law is against it.
- We don't care.

1310
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,680
We will rewrite the law.

1311
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,520
We will prosecute the officer,
who discriminated them, publicly.

1312
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,360
Don't interfere and
mind your own business.

1313
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,280
We, the youth, will oppose those
who use their money and power

1314
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,960
for discrimination.

1315
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,480
We will acquire this temple

1316
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:36,400
and make it a public property.
- Hail Thalikotta Temple..

1317
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,120
Hail..
- Thalikotta Temple..

1318
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,440
Police should obey rules!
- Police should obey rules..

1319
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,360
Police should obey rules!
- Police should obey rules..

1320
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,640
Police should obey rules!
- Police should obey rules..

1321
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:45,680
What nonsense!

1322
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:51,000
We won't sit idle if you dare
to hurt my students.

1323
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,880
Then ask them to go back.

1324
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,680
This property belongs to Mr. Smith.

1325
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,720
I oppose the rule formulated by
denying the citizens their rights.

1326
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,520
This is their worship place.

1327
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,080
Hail Prof. Das.
- Hail Prof. Das..

1328
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,760
Hail Prof. Das.
- Hail Prof. Das..

1329
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,680
Hail..

1330
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,840
Thanks.

1331
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,880
Inspector

1332
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,240
I have a request.

1333
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,640
Don't let Mr. Smith
have it for now.

1334
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,000
Let me call the minister

1335
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,240
and meet the political
leaders in here.

1336
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,640
Proceed only after that.

1337
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:20,720
Come on, boys.

1338
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,320
Hail Prof. Das.
- Hail Prof. Das..

1339
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,400
Hail..

1340
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,120
Father of all, we come
before your holy presence

1341
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,240
at this moment of grief and sorrow.

1342
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:34,560
We are gathered here in the memory
of our departed brother

1343
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,080
and friend, Mr. Alexander.

1344
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,960
You can meet your daughter now.

1345
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,200
We have conducted the mass
here only for this.

1346
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,560
Come.

1347
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,680
The spirit of cheerfulness

1348
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,560
despite the troubles
and turmoils of the world.

1349
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,720
And the Christian charity

1350
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,680
which was his motto in life.

1351
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:05,760
Dear.

1352
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,000
If you tell us the secret
of the treasure

1353
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,120
you can live with your daughter.

1354
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:20,040
Help us to emulate all his goodness
in his own life.

1355
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,600
That we may thus witness for this.

1356
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,600
Our esteemed brother

1357
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,640
and our Lord and saviour,
Jesus Christ.

1358
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:29,760
Amen.
- Amen.

1359
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,400
Sister.

1360
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,480
Where is my father?
- He came here and saw you, Mary.

1361
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,640
But a police inspector
came at that time.

1362
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,880
Please take me to my father.
- We shouldn't go there.

1363
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,680
He is hiding in a hidden cave.

1364
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,440
Nothing will happen if I meet him.

1365
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,120
You shouldn't meet him today.

1366
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,960
I will arrange a meeting for you
to meet your father, Sister.

1367
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,920
Sister..
- Okay, please go now.

1368
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,720
You shouldn't go
to the temple property

1369
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,400
until the government issues
another order.

1370
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,800
That's my own property.

1371
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,600
Why isn't the case over yet?

1372
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,200
The owner of the land is not able
to get inside the property.

1373
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,680
The public is against it.

1374
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,160
I don't care about the public.

1375
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,360
We will take over our property.

1376
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,480
You shouldn't do it when the public
is against it.

1377
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,680
I can't wait a minute.

1378
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,440
It's a government order.
- Don't threaten me.

1379
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,760
You can go.

1380
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,800
We have doubt that you are behind
the death of your servant.

1381
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,480
Therefore, you shouldn't go out
of this bungalow without my orders.

1382
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,480
Mr. Smith, this is my order.

1383
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,760
Is this the plant you were talking
about, ma'am? - Yes.

1384
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:14,960
Oh, no.
There is a snake.

1385
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,520
It's a snake.
- Run.

1386
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,800
Oh, no. It's a snake.

1387
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,720
Oh, no.

1388
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,240
Kill it.

1389
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,320
Oh, no.

1390
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:27,440
That's a snake.
- Kill it.

1391
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,280
Oh, God!
Catch the snake.

1392
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,440
I am sorry.
- I am also sorry.

1393
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,040
Sir, the snake escaped.
- Yes. The snake will escape.

1394
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,800
Aren't you the one who tried
to kill it? - Yes, sir.

1395
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,160
You go and continue your work.
- Okay.

1396
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,920
Everyone, go back to your work.

1397
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,640
Please be careful.

1398
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,240
Did you get scared?
- No. I scared you.

1399
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,600
That's all right.

1400
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,080
I didn't do it purposefully.
Forgive me.

1401
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,600
It's okay. Anyone can hug someone
else in situations like these.

1402
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,520
Thanks.
- No mention.

1403
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,720
Let me remind you that my boys got
rid of the snake. - I agree.

1404
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,120
Girls were shocked and stood still.
- I agree.

1405
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,560
But you shouldn't believe
that women are devils.

1406
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,320
My opinion changed.

1407
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,000
Come here.

1408
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,440
Forward! Quick march!

1409
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,640
Halt!

1410
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:40,120
Okay. Forward march.

1411
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:52,840
Good morning.

1412
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,800
Oh, Lord Krishna, you are the king
in the world of love.

1413
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:28,440
You invoked the feeling of
love inside a rough man like me.

1414
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,760
Sir, did you call me?
- Nothing..

1415
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:32,800
Raghu.
- Sir.

1416
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:37,320
Raghu, the surroundings
have changed suddenly.

1417
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,480
It has got a new light and feeling.
Isn't it?

1418
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,280
I can't see any change, sir.
It's still the same.

1419
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:45,720
No..

1420
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,640
Nature is calling someone.

1421
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,400
I can't hear it, sir.

1422
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,880
Yes, it does.
Please listen carefully.

1423
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:58,120
Look at that. The breeze
is caressing the clouds.

1424
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:04,040
Nature has become an elixir
in the light of the moon.

1425
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,600
You have suddenly become
an admirer of beauty.

1426
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:13,120
An unknown feeling has changed
my perspective of life.

1427
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:17,680
Please sing a song to praise
the nature as you are an artist.

1428
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,360
Oh, no, sir. The cruel ladies
in the next door will come here.

1429
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,920
No. They won't
do anything now.

1430
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:29,120
You should sing a song by losing
yourself in that moonlight.

1431
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,840
Please go.
- Okay, sir.

1432
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:12,120
"The full moon touched me."

1433
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:16,360
"The symphony of lotus
smiled back."

1434
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,000
"Hey, gorgeous,
your smile invited me."

1435
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:24,960
"The vines of dreams
glowed with joy."

1436
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:29,520
"My vines of dreams glowed
with joy."

1437
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,200
"The full moon touched me."

1438
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,600
"The symphony of lotus
smiled back."

1439
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,200
"Hey, gorgeous,
your smile invited me."

1440
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:47,440
"The vines of dreams
glowed with joy."

1441
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,840
"My vines of dreams glowed
with joy."

1442
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,920
"I lost myself
in your deep blue eyes"

1443
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:16,560
"like a soft musical symphony
of spring".

1444
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,360
"I lost myself
in your deep blue eyes"

1445
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:25,200
"like a soft musical symphony
of spring".

1446
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:30,200
"My feelings have danced
along with the waves"

1447
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,760
"of your dreams."

1448
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,360
"My feelings have danced
along with the waves"

1449
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:44,680
"of your dreams."

1450
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:01,960
"The full moon touched me."

1451
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,480
"The symphony of lotus
has smiled back."

1452
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:11,040
"Hey, gorgeous,
your smile invited me."

1453
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:15,160
"The vines of dreams
glowed with joy."

1454
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:20,160
"My vines of dreams glowed
with joy."

1455
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:42,880
"In the blooming vines
of asparagus"

1456
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:47,280
"the wind has made a bed."

1457
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:52,000
"In the blooming vines
of asparagus"

1458
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:56,400
"the wind has made a bed."

1459
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:01,200
"Please make another bed"

1460
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:05,680
"to share some sweet joys,
my dear."

1461
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,680
"Please make another bed"

1462
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:15,640
"to share some sweet joys,
my dear."

1463
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:33,320
"The full moon touched me."

1464
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,760
"The symphony of lotus
has smiled back."

1465
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:42,400
"Hey, gorgeous,
your smile invited me."

1466
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:46,680
"The vines of dreams
glowed with joy."

1467
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,960
"My vines of dreams glowed
with joy."

1468
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:57,720
Where is Balan?

1469
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,360
Please sit here.
I will bring him now.

1470
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,520
I want to go back soon.
Ma'am will get worried.

1471
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:03,680
I will be back.

1472
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,120
I have brought her here by saying
that her lover, Balan, called her.

1473
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,080
Please don't create a scene.
Send her back soon.

1474
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,600
Keep it.
- Can you give some more?

1475
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:24,760
Don't worry. My boys..
What is the name of that girl?

1476
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,400
Sathi.
- My boys will find her.

1477
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,160
They are my students.
They are trained like that.

1478
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,480
Raghu.
- Sir.

1479
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,600
Balan.
- Sir. - Appu.

1480
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,760
Why are you hiding?
You should find Sathi at any cost.

1481
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,640
This is a prestige issue.

1482
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,360
You can go.
- Okay, sir. Come on.

1483
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:44,600
Where did she go alone?
Did she meet with an accident?

1484
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,280
Don't worry.

1485
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,920
Calm down and go back to sleep.

1486
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,840
Yes. Good night..

1487
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,680
Mr. Poulose.

1488
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,280
Why did you hide from us?

1489
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,200
I didn't put down
the fire in the furnace.

1490
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,360
I am going to put down the fire.

1491
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,080
Did you see my friend, Sathi?

1492
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,200
No. I am coming back
from the market.

1493
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:08,080
Okay, bye.

1494
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,480
Did you go to the market
without putting down the fire?

1495
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,640
Tell me the truth.
Did you see Sathi?

1496
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,720
I don't know anything. Oh, no..
Don't kill me. - Tell me..

1497
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,040
Oh, no. I will tell you the truth.

1498
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:19,640
Contractor,
you didn't drink much today.

1499
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,400
I will fall asleep
if I drink more.

1500
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,240
Damn.. You shouldn't sleep.

1501
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,360
She will fly away like a bird.

1502
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,680
Really?

1503
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,400
Who are you?
Why did you come here?

1504
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,480
Nothing.
- Don't be scared.

1505
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:23,880
Oh, no. Please save me.

1506
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,400
Oh, no.
- Don't shout.

1507
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:27,520
Hold her.

1508
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,200
Oh, no.

1509
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:34,360
Oh, no.

1510
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,600
Please don't beat us.

1511
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,160
Please don't beat us.

1512
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:41,840
Don't beat us.

1513
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,360
Don't beat us.

1514
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,800
Oh, no.
- Don't move.

1515
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:51,360
Aristocrats like you try to rape
the girls who stay over here.

1516
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,920
We should torture them publically

1517
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,320
so that the other officers
don't repeat this.

1518
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,360
No. We should discuss with the
professor and do the needful.

1519
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,920
Go. Walk!

1520
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:03,960
Walk!

1521
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,360
Did you see? They are the
aristocrats of this village.

1522
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,040
One is a powerful
government employee.

1523
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,880
Another one is a forest
contractor.

1524
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,400
The third one is an important
person in here.

1525
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,800
We should punish him
as Velu Thampi Dalawa did.

1526
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,240
We should beat him in front
of the public.

1527
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,440
Inspector, please arrest them
and take necessary actions.

1528
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:26,800
I can't do it, sir.
I will file the case.

1529
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:32,160
My students have caught these
anti-social people.

1530
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:33,320
That's true, sir.

1531
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,520
There will be politicians
and parties to protect them.

1532
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,720
I will get a transfer
for arresting them.

1533
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,400
If the people who
should maintain the law

1534
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,480
forget their duty
for money and power

1535
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,960
then the current youth
will undertake their duties.

1536
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,320
I will be their leader
if it's needed.

1537
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,520
You can do what you want to.

1538
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,400
We should have punished them, sir.
- No.. We shouldn't do it.

1539
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,480
We are not supposed to take the law
into our own hands.

1540
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,640
Come on, boys.
Let's see what happens.

1541
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:02,280
Leaders,
don't think that you have escaped.

1542
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,600
We should teach him a lesson today.

1543
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,280
He shouldn't cheat us anymore.

1544
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,240
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1545
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:11,880
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1546
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:13,160
What are you doing?
- Oh, no.

1547
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,320
Oh, no. Get down.
- Oh, no.

1548
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,800
Oh, no.

1549
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,440
Jesus Christ will not forgive me.

1550
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,040
I obeyed them because I was scared

1551
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:26,560
that I would lose my job
if I didn't listen to them.

1552
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,440
You shouldn't hang yourself
because of that.

1553
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,520
What is it, Poulose?

1554
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,840
I wanted to do penance for my sins.

1555
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,720
Like you say, 'for if you forgive
the others their trespasses'

1556
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,920
'your heavenly Father
will also forgive you.'

1557
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:41,880
We forgive you.

1558
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:42,840
Mr. Poulose.
- Yes.

1559
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,840
Please buy a packet
of cigarette for me. - Okay.

1560
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,800
Go far and buy it. Okay?
- Okay.

1561
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:47,760
I got Rs. 10.

1562
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:48,960
Don't come back soon.
- Excuse me.

1563
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,240
Ma'am and professor are not here.

1564
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,640
We should utilise this time
by talking to each other.

1565
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,480
Is that it?
Come on.

1566
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,600
Come on..

1567
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:02,040
Don't stay here.
Come on, Leela.

1568
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,000
Come on..

1569
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:12,680
I saved you by risking my life.
Don't forget it.

1570
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,280
I will never forget it.

1571
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,600
Promise me.
- I promise you.

1572
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,400
You will break the promise
after we return.

1573
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:24,640
It won't happen. It will be nice
to stay here forever.

1574
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:25,920
Oh, no. Not really.

1575
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:29,880
I can't climb these hills
during my old age.

1576
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,280
Don't worry.
Lovers will be young forever.

1577
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:38,520
We won't be able to find you
after this camp.

1578
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:43,720
Latha, please don't complicate
our love because of this doubt.

1579
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,160
No. I trust you.

1580
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,520
Let your trust save you.

1581
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:55,360
I will do anything to make
this love a success.

1582
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,360
I promise you..
- I promise you..

1583
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,560
In this sacred kitchen..

1584
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,960
I promise to be
with you forever..

1585
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,720
Poulose.
- Oh, no.

1586
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,880
Oh, no. I got a stomach ache.
- I got a stomach ache, Sister.

1587
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,240
Sister, we have a stomach
ache all over the body.

1588
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,560
We have a stomach ache
from head to toe.

1589
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:13,240
I have severe stomach ache
in my chest.

1590
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,880
Nobody is here to give us water.
Not even Mr. Poulose.

1591
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:18,960
Why didn't you give them hot water?

1592
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,800
Oh, no. These cruel ladies
didn't give us water, Sister.

1593
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,320
We were scared that ma'am
will scold us.

1594
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:24,800
We should help people in need.

1595
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,880
You can go.
I will bring hot water for you.

1596
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,400
No. You don't need to come.

1597
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:32,680
Please send three glasses
of hot water with them.

1598
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,160
Come on.
- Oh, no.

1599
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,200
Let us go and sit in the hall.

1600
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,400
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1601
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,840
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1602
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:43,120
Please don't be discouraged.

1603
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,320
My students and I
will not give up on this

1604
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:49,640
until the townsfolk gets justice.

1605
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,400
We got this now.
- Thanks.

1606
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:00,600
'With due respect towards
the feelings of people'

1607
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,200
'we open this old
Thalikotta Temple'

1608
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,520
'to the public for worshipping'.

1609
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:11,280
'Along with that, the officers
who cheated the public'

1610
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,480
'will be punished according
to the law'.

1611
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,280
Students.

1612
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:25,240
We stood united
without any differences

1613
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:28,400
and this victory is
the result of that.

1614
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,120
The benefit of the public is more
important than the politicians.

1615
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:35,280
That is my principle.

1616
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,560
You and your brave students

1617
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,080
have done this service for us.

1618
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:45,680
W-We will never forget this.

1619
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,440
Sir..

1620
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,320
We are in trouble.
- What is the matter?

1621
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:05,320
The government has ordered to open
the temple to the public.

1622
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,560
What nonsense?
- It's true, sir.

1623
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,360
Along with that, they have sent
a report and fired our officer.

1624
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,480
That's very serious.
- It's really serious, sir.

1625
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:15,520
We should do something before
the public takes over the temple

1626
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,120
otherwise, our plans will fail.

1627
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:18,760
Come on. Let's go.
- Yes.

1628
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,800
We will give enough properties
for you to live happily.

1629
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,800
Don't suffer here. Please tell us
about the treasure.

1630
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,240
I won't tell you anything.

1631
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:30,440
Thomas,
be happy with your daughter.

1632
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,400
Your daughter will go
back from here tomorrow.

1633
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:34,480
You will never be able to see her
again in your lifetime.

1634
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,240
What is your decision?

1635
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,320
Are you going to cheat my daughter?

1636
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,560
Write a letter to her.

1637
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:41,800
Why should I?

1638
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,960
Write a letter saying that you
want to meet her in the bungalow.

1639
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:46,040
I won't write it.

1640
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:47,160
Oh, no.

1641
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:50,400
Come on. Write.

1642
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,200
I'll write..

1643
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:53,400
Come on, write it.

1644
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,400
My dear students.

1645
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,360
And my dear Lakshmi.

1646
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,680
I'm sorry.
Prof. Lakshmi.

1647
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,680
We are going to depart
from here tomorrow.

1648
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:12,480
We came from different places
and met here in this rest house.

1649
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,960
Keeping aside all our hatred
and jealousy

1650
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,880
we are going to depart

1651
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,040
with the sweet memories

1652
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,720
of love, friendship and happiness.

1653
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:29,240
I hope our friendship

1654
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,880
will motivate us

1655
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,560
in attaining

1656
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,640
our future goals.

1657
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,280
Wish you all good luck.

1658
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,160
Raghu, I request you

1659
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:53,080
to make us happy
by singing a song.

1660
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:04,040
"Even the voiceless
Veena will sing"

1661
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:08,920
"if it is touched by
the divine fingers of love."

1662
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:13,880
"Even the wordless
Veena will sing."

1663
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:18,760
"Even the voiceless
Veena will sing."

1664
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:42,800
"Our youthfulness is the sculptor"

1665
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:47,440
"who carves the heaven
out of our dreams."

1666
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:57,480
"Our youthfulness is the sculptor"

1667
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:02,360
"who carves the heaven
out of our dream."

1668
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:07,520
"With the blue eyes"

1669
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:12,360
"you wrote the chants
of affection."

1670
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:21,480
"We will never forget.."

1671
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:26,560
"We will never forget
this beautiful song."

1672
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:31,520
"Even the voiceless
Veena will sing"

1673
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:36,400
"if it is touched by
the divine fingers of love."

1674
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:41,040
"Even the wordless
Veena will sing."

1675
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:46,120
"Even the voiceless
Veena will sing."

1676
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:10,000
"Blended by the thoughts"

1677
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:15,040
"you showered your smile on me."

1678
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:24,880
"Blended by the thoughts"

1679
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:29,480
"you showered your smile on me."

1680
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:34,840
"Even if it does take me ages"

1681
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,800
"we shall unite in the end."

1682
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:49,000
"We shall never separate.."

1683
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:53,920
"Our hearts shall
never be separated."

1684
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:58,720
"Even the voiceless
Veena will sing"

1685
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:03,640
"if it is touched by
the divine fingers of love."

1686
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:08,400
"Even the wordless
Veena will sing."

1687
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:14,520
"Even the voiceless
Veena will sing."

1688
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,800
She is dead.
- Is it?

1689
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:06,960
Oh, my God!
- Was she killed as well?

1690
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:11,120
What shall we do now?
- Let's inform the professor.

1691
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,120
We will take her to our chapel.
- Yes, sir.

1692
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,600
Raghu! Raghu!
Did he escape?

1693
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:25,760
We have caught many crooks,
but this guy has outplayed us.

1694
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,920
We better leave from here.
- Come, let's go.

1695
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,880
Let's not make it late.
We should call the police.

1696
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,760
It's not necessary.
We'll inform them next morning.

1697
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,400
No,
we should call them now itself.

1698
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,560
Let's go, sir.

1699
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,760
Manager!
- Appu, you should stay here.

1700
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,440
Sir, call them on the phone.

1701
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,320
Hello..

1702
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,040
The telephone is not working.
- Is it not working?

1703
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,800
Hello!
Hello!

1704
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:19,240
It's like this sometimes.

1705
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,200
This is a hilly region. A tree
might have fallen onto the lines.

1706
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,200
I will go and inform them.
- Sir, you don't need to go.

1707
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,080
We can go. - Don't go now.
It's dangerous.

1708
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:28,080
It's okay. I will go.
- All right, then. Be careful!

1709
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:29,680
There won't be any boat.

1710
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:32,800
It will be difficult
for the next 15 days.

1711
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:35,720
The power went off!
- Where is the torch?

1712
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:38,720
Where is the manager?
- The foreigner is missing as well.

1713
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:01,760
Who is it?
What is this?

1714
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,560
Get up!
Get up.

1715
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,240
Sir, sister's corpse isn't here.

1716
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,600
Oh, no! Where is our teacher?

1717
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,920
What?
Where has she gone?

1718
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,520
What is happening?
- A ghost.

1719
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:17,360
We don't know what happened.
- Nonsense!

1720
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:18,400
There is something fishy about it.

1721
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,680
I have my doubts, sir.

1722
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:20,880
Please take care of them.

1723
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,880
Appu.
Appu, what is happening?

1724
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,560
The figure we saw that day.

1725
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:31,960
Sir.

1726
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,520
If we don't come back
by tomorrow morning

1727
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,560
you can leave with them.

1728
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:38,240
We won't come back
without finding it out.

1729
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,040
Be careful.
- Come on.

1730
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:43,840
Sir!
- Don't be afraid.

1731
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,200
I will be with you,
no matter what happens.

1732
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:56,160
"Where is the lamp?"

1733
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:02,040
"Oh, abandoned shore,
where is the lamp?"

1734
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:09,800
"Where is the lamp?"

1735
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:14,960
"Oh, abandoned shore,
where is the lamp?"

1736
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:20,960
"The darkness of the night"

1737
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:26,480
"has made our planet earth
tremble in fear."

1738
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:31,800
"The darkness of the night"

1739
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:36,640
"has made our planet earth
tremble in fear."

1740
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:44,520
"Where is the lamp?"

1741
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:11,160
"The river bank has tales"

1742
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:17,080
"of shadows and fear
to tell."

1743
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:19,120
"Of shadows."

1744
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:24,840
"The wind carries the smell
of warm blood"

1745
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:30,080
"from the cemetery,
reminiscence of death."

1746
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:32,280
"The reminiscence of death."

1747
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:52,160
"Where is the lamp?"

1748
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:16,320
"The grasp of the ominous
black river"

1749
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:21,720
"has disturbed the wind
and shattered hopes."

1750
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,960
"Shattered hopes."

1751
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:29,480
"The smell of death
is all over."

1752
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:36,480
"Even the numb mountains
are weeping."

1753
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:55,000
"Where is the lamp?"

1754
02:03:55,200 --> 02:04:00,480
"Oh, abandoned shore,
where is the lamp?"

1755
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:05,720
"The darkness of the night"

1756
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:10,240
"has made our planet earth
tremble in fear."

1757
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:16,200
"Where is the lamp?"

1758
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:21,720
"Oh, abandoned shore,
where is the lamp?"

1759
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:32,880
Who is he?

1760
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:35,160
He is the butler
at Mr. Smith's mansion.

1761
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:39,240
So, he was the ghost
who murdered sister.

1762
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:42,520
A police inspector shot him in
the chest, but it didn't harm him.

1763
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:43,760
See this.

1764
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:48,200
He has got an iron armour.

1765
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:49,800
What a guy!

1766
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:53,280
Mr. Smith has a motive
behind all this.

1767
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:55,320
We must not leave him.
Come on, get up.

1768
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,600
Get up.

1769
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:03,160
What is this?
- Who is it? Open up.

1770
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:07,560
Stop there.

1771
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:08,800
Come on, tell me.

1772
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,280
Your daughter is here.

1773
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:13,240
As promised, we have brought
your daughter.

1774
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,320
You and your daughter
can live happily

1775
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:17,720
if you disclose
the location of the treasure.

1776
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:20,840
No, I don't want
to commit this sin.

1777
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:23,680
Then we will kill your daughter
in front of you.

1778
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:26,200
Come on, tell me.
- Answer him.

1779
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:27,600
Or else, you won't see
your daughter ever again.

1780
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:29,920
No, please don't kill my daughter.

1781
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:32,400
I will tell you.

1782
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:36,120
If you look under the big rock

1783
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:39,920
at the south side of the holy pond,
you will find the treasure.

1784
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:41,400
Very good.

1785
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:42,280
Dear!

1786
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:53,200
Open it.

1787
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:55,320
Open it!
- Open!

1788
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,720
Who are you?
I didn't get you.

1789
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:30,920
I am the father of Sister Sophia.

1790
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:32,800
Please go fast.

1791
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:36,360
Go and catch him, quickly.

1792
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:40,360
Or else, he may escape.

1793
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:43,000
Go and catch that wretched man.

1794
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:44,280
Quickly!

1795
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:12,360
Don't let them escape.
They might jump into the river.

1796
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,400
Driver, take us
to the police station.

1797
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:15,560
Who are you?
I didn't get you.

1798
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:18,400
Who am I?
I am CID Officer, Sekharan.

1799
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:22,080
The death of Mr. Smith's brother
was a suspicious affair.

1800
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:24,920
So, you were disguised
as the boatman since then.

1801
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,760
Yes, we were able to capture
the culprit with your assistance.

1802
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:30,640
So, shall we take her corpse?

1803
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:32,440
Come.

1804
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,240
What about sister's corpse?

1805
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:53,560
It is inside Mr. Smith's bungalow.

1806
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:57,160
The motive behind her murder was
the transportation of the treasure.

1807
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:01,920
And since he did not disclose
the location of the treasure

1808
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:04,440
Mr. Smith killed
his own brother, Alexander

1809
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,960
and imprisoned his manager, Thomas.
Right? - Yes.

1810
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:10,800
The golden deity found near the
lake was also a part of it. - Yes.

1811
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:14,160
The treasure that Mr. Alexander
found first

1812
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:15,800
could be a part of it.

1813
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:19,560
Mr. Alexander and his manager
must have thought that giving

1814
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:20,920
the remaining treasure
to the villagers

1815
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:22,440
was the right thing to do.

1816
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:25,120
They would have shared
their plan with Mr. Smith.

1817
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:26,280
Correct.

1818
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:29,280
Smith disagreed with them, and that
is what resulted in the murder.

1819
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:34,160
The death of the servant
intensified your doubts on Smith.

1820
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:35,080
Yes.

1821
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:38,960
The scary ghost, who killed
the villagers, and his claim

1822
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:41,960
that he was the owner
of the plot including the temple

1823
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:46,720
were mere tricks to keep
the treasure out of other's hands.

1824
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:48,960
You did something impossible.

1825
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,920
The treasure will go
to the rightful heirs.

1826
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:54,280
We will leave then.
- Good luck.

1827
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:01,640
We are short of words
to express our gratitude.

1828
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:04,040
We wish you could participate

1829
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:07,920
in the ritual which follows
the consecration of the deity.

1830
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:10,120
Dear villagers.

1831
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:14,040
Your triumph has made us happy.

1832
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:18,400
But on the altar of your triumph

1833
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:22,600
the lives of two of our
most dearest friends

1834
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,040
had to be sacrificed.

1835
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:30,320
One of them, Raghavan,
who was my favourite student.

1836
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:36,160
The other one,
our dearest sister, Sophia.

1837
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:38,200
Even if we leave this place

1838
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:41,160
the souls of those
two beautiful human beings

1839
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:45,160
will stay here forever.

1840
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:48,760
Villagers, goodbye.

1841
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:06,360
'Salutations.'
