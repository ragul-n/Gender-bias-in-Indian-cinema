170
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:31,049
Rosy! Have you spoken to Sate in another
way ?

171
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:33,960
Go man! He hasn't considered that. His main
intends is money alone.

172
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,020
He didn't turn at all.

173
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:41,365
God! Why are giving punishments like this? My
husband was not correct

174
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:43,928
Now my son is also not correct.

175
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:48,935
l'm here for you Sister-in-law. Won't l get any
idea ?

Don't confuse repeatedly

186
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,226
Advocate too will keep his finger on his nose for
this idea.

Reason for all these are his uncle and that sinner
