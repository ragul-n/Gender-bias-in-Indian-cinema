2
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:26,482
There's one thing that I
have learnt from my dad.

3
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:29,642
We never choose life.

4
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:32,446
Life chooses us.

5
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:39,495
I didn't choose my profession
as a police officer.

6
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:46,893
Through my father, Circle Inspector
Sreenivasan, the profession chose me instead.

7
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:54,474
There will be a case in the life of any
police officer that can never be forgotten.

8
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,606
I had one such case in my life too.

9
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:04,987
Melvin Philip... I heard that name for
the first time through that case.

10
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:11,321
And I never thought that name
was going to change my life.

11
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:18,862
After all... life is a hunt. And it is we
who choose whether to hunt or to be hunted.

12
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,855
Grandpa is not giving my teddy.

13
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:04,893
Have your food, sweetie.

14
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,492
Why do you take her teddy
bear all the time?

15
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:11,804
Have food, dad.

16
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:20,504
Grandpa has peed in his pants.

17
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:24,107
You know grandpa is ill, right?

18
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:26,213
You have food.

19
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:30,658
Get up, dad.

20
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,795
Mom, I'm really sorry.

21
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:39,856
What for?

22
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:41,029
For making fun of grandpa.

23
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,603
Come on.. that's okay.

24
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:45,971
Why are you laughing, mom?

25
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:48,736
I was thinking about an old story.

26
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,180
Long back, grandpa had a Fiat Padmini.

27
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:54,883
You know what he used to call it?
"Pee vehicle"

28
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:59,153
I was scared of speed then.

29
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:02,848
Whenever grandpa went
fast, I used to pee!

30
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:06,551
Thus Fiat Padmini became "Pee vehicle".

31
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:09,120
Hello..

32
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:20,071
Good morning madam.

33
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:22,606
This is the spots.

34
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,278
The incident happened here.

35
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,592
The brake has been
applied all on a sudden.

36
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:47,202
So it doesn't feel like a collision.

37
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:49,066
It could have been blocked purposely.

38
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,771
Seems to be.

39
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:52,998
Who saw this first?

40
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:56,145
Sanjeevan did, while patrolling.

41
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,041
Wham did you see?

42
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:02,180
Madam, it was during the routine patrol
that the car was found abandoned.

43
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:06,780
Since the valuables were found inside,
it was evident that the motive wasn't theft.

44
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,878
On tracing the number,
it could be found that...

45
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,790
...the car belonged to film
star Uma Satyamoorthi.

46
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:13,395
I had informed the matter to
the control room right then.

47
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:19,163
It was during a detailed search that we could
find the mobile lying below the front seat.

48
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:33,710
A car is found abandoned in the
main road during the night.

49
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,150
A well-known actress is missing from there.

50
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:39,154
No sign of attack or any struggle.

51
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:42,724
It's quite strange.

52
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:47,752
Ma'am, they had gone last to attend the get
together function of their college mates.

53
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:51,758
Uma had reached Hotel White Clouds
at 7. 30 in the evening driving herself.

54
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,730
She went back at 10. 30 in the night.

55
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,201
Check the CCTV at the hotel.

56
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,432
I want the details of all who
came for the get together.

57
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:00,233
Sure Ma'am.

58
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:03,638
Did you trace the owner of the
mobile that was found there?

59
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:07,973
The connection is under the
name of one Melvin Philip.

60
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:09,878
The outgoing calls from this phone
has gone to a single number.

61
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:11,643
That too five times.

62
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:12,286
Which number?

63
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:18,755
All the five calls have
gone to Xylex sir's number.

64
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:19,757
What?

65
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:40,336
Xylex, the person who died in your
station could have been a convict...

66
00:11:40,337 --> 00:11:43,147
but he's a human being too.

67
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:47,120
Then what about the three kids sexually
abused by him? Aren't they human beings?

68
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:50,358
So? That justifies your wrongful act?

69
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:57,327
Wham wrong did I do? I've already told you..
we got him from a completely provoked mob.

70
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:00,090
He was already beaten up by then.

71
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:01,925
(Phone beeps) Sorry.

72
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,234
That is the reason for his death as well.

73
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,705
You can check the autopsy report.

74
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,498
But that doesn't let you run
away from your responsibilities.

75
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:12,442
Listen... I have already
gone through a lot.

76
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:16,446
I am in a stage where I can't
decide even on my personal issues.

77
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:19,283
Even regarding adopting a child.

78
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:21,790
I have never misused my uniform.

79
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,851
This is not just a profession
for me" it's a passion.

80
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,332
Yes, it's the same number.

81
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,898
When was it? You still remember?

82
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,902
Almost two weeks back.

83
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:34,999
On the day of that hearing.

84
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,470
At first I thought it was a prank call.

85
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:39,397
The connection has been taken under
the name of a Melvin Philip.

86
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:40,100
It was taken recently.

87
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:41,205
The matter is different.

88
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:44,208
He has made only five outgoing
calls from that number.

89
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:48,114
The funny pan is that all the
calls have been made to you.

90
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,748
Now I can be blamed for
kidnapping Uma Samyamoorthi.

91
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,948
I am going through
the best time!

92
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:57,949
It's the case file. Just go through.

93
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:04,256
Please spare me from this case Already
I'm in trouble dealing with another!

94
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:09,201
He is our prime suspect. It's important for
this case to know why he called you.

95
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:11,232
And it's our responsibility.

96
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:14,505
I saw everybody's responsibility
when a problem happened to me.

97
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,435
Give me the file.

98
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:24,408
Bala had called.

99
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:25,587
Hmm..

100
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:27,117
Why don't you take up this case?

101
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:29,886
Anu, let's talk something else.

102
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:31,386
About what, Xylex?

103
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:33,320
Is it about adoption?

104
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:35,962
In this situation it's not going to work.

105
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:41,367
Then about the treatment... but
the problem is not for me..

106
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,078
I didn't mean to hurt you.

107
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:58,948
Just think" if you can prove this case, all
the black marks in your career will be over.

108
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,506
You don't know when he went out?

109
00:14:21,632 --> 00:14:22,201
No, sir.

110
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,207
Melvin has no friends here?

111
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:26,114
No.

112
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:30,051
He is a peculiar kind...
doesn't talk to anyone much.

113
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:31,642
Visitors?

114
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:35,180
Visitors come to him occasionally.

115
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,590
When did he come yesterday night?

116
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:42,223
He came late than usual. But
I'm not sure about the time.

117
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,194
If he comes here you should inform us.

118
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:48,365
Okay, sir.

119
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:49,197
Let's go.

120
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,281
Ma'am... All the visuals after Uma Satyamoorthi
came to the get together has been checked.

121
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:09,616
Okay, let's go.

122
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:21,628
Ma'am.. Uma's car reached the
parking at exactly 7:12pm.

123
00:15:26,597 --> 00:15:29,009
Uma reached the party hall at 7:21pm.

124
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,444
Now see this Ma'am.

125
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:34,378
Do you see the three persons who are
with Uma while going to the hall?

126
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:37,343
Just watch that guy.

127
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:40,555
The one standing near the
other three... that's Melvin.

128
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:44,318
I have checked the list of guests
who came for the get together.

129
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:45,456
He was her college mate.

130
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:47,587
This is the camera near the
parking area of the hotel...

131
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:51,189
Do you see the grey Santro
that follows Uma's car?

132
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,163
Rajeev, take him immediately.

133
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:55,962
Yes Ma'am.

134
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:37,001
Four years back... to be
exact, Nov 13, 2011...

135
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:41,545
That was when your daughter
Angel went missing, right?

136
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:45,481
Yes.

137
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:48,711
The missing of your daughter
made your wife Sherin in...

138
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:51,625
...to a state of depression and
she became a drug addict.

139
00:16:54,818 --> 00:17:03,169
The effort was to bring her back to normal.
But by then...

140
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:15,272
Your honour, it has been proven beyond the
doubt that this convict has done a cruel act.

141
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:23,519
As such the convict may be given the maximum
possible punishment of life imprisonment.

142
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,021
Any further submissions?

143
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:26,784
That's all your honour.

144
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:33,098
Excuse me, has someone named
Sherin been admitted here?

145
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:37,697
Are you Melvin?

146
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:38,229
Yes.

147
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:38,229
Please come.

148
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,817
Jumped from the balcony.
Death happened on the spot.

149
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:05,593
(Sobbing)

150
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:14,541
Melvin.. your old college
mate is a famous actress now.

151
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:21,716
Was it an infatuation during the college days
or thejealousy seeing her current state?

152
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:23,810
What was the reason?

153
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:31,082
She's safe, Madam.

154
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:34,623
Where is she?

155
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:38,197
I haven't troubled Uma in any way, sir.

156
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,693
After all, she is a celebrity.

157
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:45,571
She shouldn't know
about our shortcomings.

158
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:52,340
The life of celebrities is not like ours.

159
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:56,213
Everything is better for them.

160
00:18:56,707 --> 00:19:02,157
Better food, better clothes
everything is better.

161
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:08,859
So I gave her a better death.

162
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:16,827
Painless death.

163
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,866
Mum did you say?

164
00:19:21,532 --> 00:19:24,741
I killed her.

165
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:36,958
Just one question to you, Melvin.

166
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:41,186
How much do you trust your wife?

167
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:29,904
Did you go out today?

168
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:33,211
No.

169
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,686
Prakashan said he saw
you at Kadavanthra.

170
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:40,278
That's why I asked you.

171
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:47,291
Oh I forgot to tell you. I had
gone to Jayalakshmi with Sreya.

172
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:52,222
It's her engagement next week.

173
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:53,701
Hmm.. Okay.

174
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,938
Can you please give me the cheese?

175
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:08,880
Okay... you saw them together.

176
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:11,646
So? What's wrong?

177
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:20,358
There will be truth
behind a series of lies.

178
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,830
Your statement to police says that every
statement made by the convict is wrong.

179
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:31,004
Definitely. See I'm a psychologist.

180
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:35,405
I can say whether a person is lying
from his body language.

181
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:36,441
Can you explain that?

182
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:41,807
Sure. If it is a lady, she will be
hesitant to look into your face or...

183
00:21:41,872 --> 00:21:46,981
...will hide her face with some object
or will deliberately make it vague..

184
00:21:47,377 --> 00:21:52,377
Err... I had forgotten... Err...
I had gone with Sreya.

185
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:48,910
It's the direct flight to Dubai. He booked
it. Sherin was sitting in the car then.

186
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:05,996
The greatest pain in the world is cheating.

187
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:11,536
There is only one punishment for that.

188
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:18,037
Death.

189
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:37,449
There is a starting point for every crime..
How it is utilized makes it perfect.

190
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:47,508
The starting point here was
a fever that Sherin had.

191
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:55,850
To portray her as a drug addict,
I injected drugs instead of medicines.

192
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:05,159
I was giving back what she had done to me.

193
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:51,604
There are three factors
to determine a crime.

194
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:57,477
The time when it happened, the
place and the reason for the death.

195
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:02,716
The time that I chose
to call Sherin.

196
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:08,054
Hello... It's not clear.

197
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:13,124
Sherin, you come out to the balcony.

198
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:19,762
I chooses the narrow balcony as the place.

199
00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:39,611
The perfect time, place and then,
the perfect crime happens...

200
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:10,650
ls there someone admitted
here under the name Sherin?

201
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:15,618
Are you Melvin?

202
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,350
Yes.

203
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:29,362
Jumped from the balcony.
The death happened on the spot.

204
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:07,697
Wham is Uma's role in this one?

205
00:27:12,268 --> 00:27:18,776
Ma'am, haven't you heard about the
wrong person at the wrong time?

206
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,650
Wham does that mean?

207
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:24,055
Emil was my next target.

208
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:27,688
But by then he had gone abroad.

209
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:35,735
When there was no chance to meet again,
this get together was made for me by Jesus.

210
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:42,096
I felt that all my plans
are breaking in a second.

211
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:49,374
I was aware that if Emil goes back
tommorow, I will lose him for ever.

212
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:12,488
I had only two options.

213
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:18,334
Either loose Emil for ever...
or kill Uma too...

214
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:20,733
I choose the second one.

215
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:22,332
Wham happened Melvin?

216
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,089
In the film star Uma Satyamoorthi case,
there is an important turnaround.

217
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,827
Melvin Philip has confessed
that he had abducted...

218
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:44,093
...and killed Uma and NRI
businessman Emil Kurian.

219
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:49,325
The convict has been taken to
procure evidence, as per Police.

220
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:52,437
Rajeev, after the bodies are
recovered, the mob will be violent.

221
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:53,864
So you should be very alert.

222
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:54,472
Sure Ma'am.

223
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:57,207
(Media persons shouting)

224
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:34,046
Ma'am, Melvin is totally confused.

225
00:30:34,304 --> 00:30:34,907
What do you mean, Rajeev?

226
00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:39,380
He can't identify the spot as
they were buried during night.

227
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:40,986
So what to do, Ma'am.

228
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:48,558
People are getting violent, Rajeev.
It's better we leave.

229
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,536
SP and IG are asking
for explanations.

230
00:30:58,428 --> 00:30:59,270
That I can handle.

231
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:01,906
But there is another issue.

232
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:06,377
The hill where we had taken Melvin
to for evidence, has a specialty.

233
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,374
There will be dense fog once in three
months and it will continue for 21 days.

234
00:31:13,276 --> 00:31:15,483
After twelve days, there
will be fog again.

235
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:17,616
We can't retrieve
the body after that.

236
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:35,203
Suppose the story told
by Melvin is true.

237
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,978
He is not sure where the
body has been buried.

238
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:40,908
We will give him some more time.

239
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:43,273
If he can remember where the
body is the issue will be solved.

240
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,946
But if the story is not true, we
have to change our approach.

241
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:52,484
How about psychic lever?

242
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:56,686
It's the method of getting close
to a suspect during interrogation.

243
00:31:57,453 --> 00:32:00,491
They should feel like we
have believed their lies.

244
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:04,236
Yes for that we have
to get closer to him.

245
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,698
He should reveal the spot even
without him knowing about it.

246
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:10,342
Even the concept of an interrogation
room should not be there.

247
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:11,936
But where?

248
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:19,117
Until I reached there yesterday,
everything was clear for me, sir.

249
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:26,289
But when I saw the mob, I couldn't
recollect the right place.

250
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,660
It's okay, Melvin.

251
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:30,687
We can understand that.

252
00:32:33,222 --> 00:32:39,662
Now you try to recollect any board
or landmark that you saw that night.

253
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:46,277
I will remind you about
what you told u; Melvin.

254
00:32:47,337 --> 00:32:50,284
It was around 01: 30 in the night
when your car reached there.

255
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,111
From there the bodies were
dragged for some 300 metres.

256
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:57,958
Then you went back to the
car to get the pickaxe.

257
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:02,061
With the same pickaxe,
a six feet deep...

258
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:04,158
Sir, one thing.

259
00:33:06,222 --> 00:33:12,571
On the way after burying the body,
there was water flowing with great force.

260
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,973
As if some pipeline was broken...

261
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:29,486
Rajeev, contact the irrigation department
to check if there was something like that.

262
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:34,090
If there was one, search
the area immediately.

263
00:34:10,853 --> 00:34:14,266
There was no such leakage in the
area that you mentioned, Melvin.

264
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,412
Bala, we will give him some more time.

265
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:26,673
Let him think.

266
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:39,317
(mumbles) What is the use of all these!

267
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,563
Mum did you say?

268
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,321
Nothing.

269
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:59,712
Just forget whatever happened.
What is the next option?

270
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,480
Sir, we have only six days.

271
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:04,551
Once the fog starts,
things will be real bad.

272
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:07,185
Within six days you have make
him say where the spot is.

273
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,684
But there is another problem, sir.

274
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:12,616
The district jail is the hub of petty
criminals and political goondas.

275
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:15,526
Problems are regularly
reported from there.

276
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:20,731
How safe will Melvin be, there?

277
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:23,636
If something happens to him
that will affect our case.

278
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,703
So we have to ensure his
safety by all means.

279
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:30,172
This is a high profile case, Bala.

280
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:32,713
Jail department will give you full support.

281
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:36,178
I will directly monitor
all his security measures.

282
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,508
This is Rajeev, Ma'am..
There is an issue at the district jail.

283
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,735
When?

284
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,144
There was a call from the jailor.

285
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,805
Then?

286
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:10,480
I think it's a conflict
between the convicts.

287
00:36:11,474 --> 00:36:13,215
Ma'am... Things are a bit out of control.

288
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:17,684
We need to take some action immediately.

289
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:20,689
Our team should reach there immediately.

290
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:23,596
If something happens
to Melvin, we are done.

291
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,694
But how do we get permission
to enter the jail premises?

292
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:27,866
Don't worry.
I will take care of it.

293
00:36:28,224 --> 00:36:29,328
Okay Ma'am.

294
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:32,936
As per the latest information, a convict
has been attacked inside the district jail.

295
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:35,708
It is not yet known on who is the
convict or what his condition is.

296
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:38,412
Anyway there is tense
situation inside the jail.

297
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,850
Pay me the money.

298
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:26,223
I have told you not to run
around while going to the park.

299
00:37:26,515 --> 00:37:27,016
Mm..

300
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:30,359
Do you know how much I was worried
when I couldn't find you?

301
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,892
Sorry, dad.

302
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:34,492
That is okay, sweetie.

303
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:54,354
As per our latest information an ex cop named
Sainuddeen was attacked inside the jail.

304
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,317
He has been jailed under
molestation charges and he had...

305
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:57,881
...entered into a scuffle with
fellow jail mates recently.

306
00:37:58,614 --> 00:38:01,616
The conflict is believed
to be a result of this.

307
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:01,685
The conflict is believed
to be a result of this.

308
00:38:01,884 --> 00:38:05,331
Melvin, you were narrating
the story of Emil and Sherin.

309
00:38:07,056 --> 00:38:09,263
Now we will comeback
to the missing link.

310
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:11,031
Uma Satyamoorthi.

311
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,682
Diya... Uma's daughter.

312
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:31,717
She is younger than Angel.

313
00:38:33,616 --> 00:38:38,690
Losing someone is more
painful than death, Melvin.

314
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:43,660
You know that pain
more than anyone else.

315
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:48,034
You can't give back
anything that she has lost.

316
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:51,667
But there is something
that you can do.

317
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,770
You can tell us where the spot is.

318
00:38:56,906 --> 00:38:59,750
This is the last chance for
the child to see her mother.

319
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:05,623
You have gone wrong, Madam.

320
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:10,058
The greatest pain than death
is not losing your loved one..

321
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:13,766
But when your
loved one betrays you.

322
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:18,767
The best way to correct a
mistake is to do a right thing.

323
00:39:19,895 --> 00:39:22,375
Here they have erred.

324
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:27,545
By killing them what I
did was the right thing.

325
00:39:27,903 --> 00:39:29,746
We have a law
prevailing here, Melvin.

326
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:39,015
There is only one law, sir. It
has been written by the Lord.

327
00:39:40,149 --> 00:39:44,757
I haven't done anything wrong
in that court... but she did.

328
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:48,567
We will discuss that topic later.

329
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:53,970
No sir. We men should
discuss that topic only.

330
00:39:57,433 --> 00:40:02,906
Can you say for sure that your
wife will never cheat you?

331
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:05,677
No.

332
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:13,426
There is only one thing that a man doesn't
know about in this world...! Woman!

333
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:25,437
Madam, can you live with someone,
after cheating on your husband?

334
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:33,671
You won't believe anything now.
But one day you will, for sure.

335
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,150
Wham the pain of being cheated is!.

336
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:38,679
Enough.

337
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:05,237
It's the jailor.
A gang had targeted him.

338
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:07,773
His life is becoming riskier
with every passing day.

339
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:11,806
Don't be tense. We will
somehow get him to talk.

340
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:12,945
How?

341
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:15,644
He is always repeating
the same story.

342
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:19,649
I think we are heading
in the wrong direction.

343
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:22,027
Hey... come on.

344
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:43,183
Go and sit in the car.
I will come soon.

345
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:49,689
Take this sir...

346
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,840
Did you withdraw Rs. 5 lakhs from the bank?
There was a message on the mobile.

347
00:42:08,097 --> 00:42:11,874
Daddy wanted some money
for the renovation of the house.

348
00:42:15,204 --> 00:42:18,117
This can be worn with all your dresses.

349
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,317
-ls this?
- No.. this".

350
00:42:25,614 --> 00:42:27,059
Madam this is from the office.

351
00:42:27,616 --> 00:42:30,597
Can you please come urgently?
There is a serious matter.

352
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,566
I will be back soon.

353
00:42:43,365 --> 00:42:47,780
This was there in the file.
Don't know who kept it there.

354
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:05,766
With every passing day, her
lies were going up in number.

355
00:43:07,256 --> 00:43:11,568
I watched her mannerisms,
as the doctor said.

356
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:14,899
She had become a big bundle of lies.

357
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:21,278
I did it at last, when
I had no other option.

358
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,677
Sir, do we need to continue this?

359
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:32,682
He is saying the same thing
for the past three hours.

360
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:36,963
Take him.

361
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,646
With every passing day, the number of lies
that she was saying was going up.

362
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,162
Are you sure that your
wife will never cheat you?

363
00:44:13,756 --> 00:44:14,996
It has been pretty long
since you called up.

364
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:19,971
I was a bit busy. What about the
renovation works of the house?

365
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:27,744
It was over last month. How will you know?
Both of you never call us.

366
00:44:28,303 --> 00:44:29,407
Anu didn't call you?

367
00:44:29,772 --> 00:44:34,312
No... it has been a
while since we talked.

368
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:43,055
That... Daddy wanted some money...
for the renovation of the house".

369
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,664
I will call you back.

370
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:37,781
I will be back after
going to the washroom.

371
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,620
What happend?
Why did you want to meet me?

372
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:33,822
There is an issue
It is confidential.

373
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,439
Okay... I'm coming soon.

374
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:45,537
I will call you later.

375
00:47:51,874 --> 00:47:55,947
A normal accident.
I had imagined so.

376
00:47:57,412 --> 00:48:05,354
But the paper that I got... It's like
someone is trying to say something.

377
00:48:06,355 --> 00:48:12,362
When you say so... that phone
call and the accident...

378
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:21,478
Hello, Manu.

379
00:48:22,204 --> 00:48:23,649
I want a help from
the cyber cell...

380
00:48:33,348 --> 00:48:34,656
This is the call details sir.

381
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:40,428
This is the log for incoming
and out going calls.

382
00:48:41,356 --> 00:48:44,428
The maximum number of calls
have come from which number?

383
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,506
It's from this number, sir. The
connection belongs to one Mr. Rony.

384
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:51,502
Sir, this is his id.

385
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:10,353
Mmm..

386
00:49:10,953 --> 00:49:15,527
Xylex, you need not come. I will
come back in the office cab.

387
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:34,176
Ma'am, the details of the last call
to the phone has been received.

388
00:49:34,543 --> 00:49:36,523
It was from one Xylex Abraham.

389
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:59,064
At that moment one
thing was clear to me.

390
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:03,172
My dad's accident...
it was planned.

391
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:08,304
And the pivotal role was
played by my best friend.

392
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,512
Anjali, you have a letter.

393
00:51:22,084 --> 00:51:25,156
New revelations in the film
star Uma Satyamoorthi case.

394
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,756
The convict Melvin Philip
had undergone psychiatric...

395
00:51:28,757 --> 00:51:32,398
...treatment at a mental hospital
as per our investigation.

396
00:51:32,794 --> 00:51:36,173
It is now clear that the
investigation of the concerned...

397
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:39,474
...officer Sreebala IPS
wasn't on the right track.

398
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:43,078
The minister had called...
They are transferring the case to CBCID.

399
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:45,811
Sir, we are almost there.

400
00:51:46,308 --> 00:51:48,379
Then show me your findings until now.

401
00:51:53,548 --> 00:51:57,462
They will take charge at sharp 02:30.
After that they want to meet you.

402
00:51:58,186 --> 00:51:59,256
Okay then" you can leave now.

403
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:03,599
Until they take charge, you are
the deciding authority, right?

404
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:04,361
So?

405
00:52:04,893 --> 00:52:06,566
All I am asking is just three hours.

406
00:52:06,862 --> 00:52:09,775
Trust me.. He will speak" Please.

407
00:52:10,732 --> 00:52:13,144
Okay... But she has to say.

408
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:16,879
Bala. Please... this is our last option.

409
00:52:25,413 --> 00:52:30,556
Bala, Thank you so much.

410
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:34,361
If we can't prove it even
now, I will be gone forever.

411
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,391
I owe you.

412
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,341
Xylex, I am asking out of curiosity.

413
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:46,274
Do you remember anything about
the day when dad had that accident?

414
00:52:58,947 --> 00:53:01,450
I have already told that
I have killed them.

415
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:05,363
What am I going to gain by not saying
the place where they were buried?

416
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:09,469
Melvin, you try to recollect
things once again.

417
00:53:35,684 --> 00:53:38,460
Time is up. They have taken charge.

418
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,000
They are on the way.

419
00:53:48,463 --> 00:53:50,374
I will tell you where the place is.

420
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:57,006
Before that both of you
should answer my question.

421
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:08,585
Tell me Madam If you learn that your best
friend is cheating on you, how will you react?

422
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:16,733
What will you do if your
wife cheats on you, sir?

423
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:47,054
It was a mistake to give so much
time for a criminal like you.

424
00:54:47,055 --> 00:54:48,898
I know the language
that suits you.

425
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,609
You want the answer? I will give.

426
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:19,796
Stop it.
Open the door.

427
00:55:22,724 --> 00:55:24,397
The discussion continues.

428
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,632
ACP Xylex Abraham was involved
in a similar case even before, right?

429
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,365
Yes.

430
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:35,307
In that circumstance, how does the commission
take this attack on Melvin by ACP?

431
00:55:35,804 --> 00:55:39,081
The commission has decided to react
strongly considering such a brutal act.

432
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:42,612
The commission has ordered
to charge a case "suo motu" (on its own motion)...

433
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:41,940
Shall we go?

434
00:56:46,074 --> 00:56:48,418
Sainuddeen sir was behind everything.

435
00:56:49,878 --> 00:56:53,553
I don't know for who it
was or why it was done.

436
00:58:35,517 --> 00:58:38,555
Actually I was waiting for you
There is an urgent client meeting at Mumbai.

437
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,192
I have to leave tomorrow itself.

438
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:41,897
Are you going alone?

439
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:45,037
Yeah.

440
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:47,903
And when will you return?

441
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:52,508
I'll come back tomorrow evening itself.

442
00:58:54,636 --> 00:58:57,515
You have to travel tomorrow.
Go and sleep.

443
00:59:45,386 --> 00:59:46,990
One thing that he said is right.

444
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:52,003
The greatest pain is when
you are being cheated.

445
00:59:53,595 --> 00:59:59,341
But there's a mistake in what he said...
why should we kill them both?

446
01:00:00,802 --> 01:00:02,338
Isn't it enough if we kill one?

447
01:00:04,072 --> 01:00:09,613
It is so painful to
lose your loved ones.

448
01:00:09,978 --> 01:00:13,983
Xylex, what all are you saying?
Enough. Go home now.

449
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:19,091
He should be killed...

450
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:52,001
Hello Ajay... I need
to leave immediately.

451
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,346
If there are any urgent
files, you send it home.

452
01:04:14,622 --> 01:04:16,932
Grandpa... give it back.

453
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:18,493
Jhanvi...

454
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:35,344
Sir, I want to see you urgently.

455
01:04:37,144 --> 01:04:39,852
I want to discuss an urgent matter.

456
01:04:45,987 --> 01:04:48,593
Perfect timing Bala.. It was
the call from Crime Branch.

457
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:51,031
Melvin is ready to show the spot.

458
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,432
But on one condition...
He will reveal it to you and Xylex only.

459
01:04:57,164 --> 01:04:59,576
Bala, there is no time to waste"
We have to act immediately.

460
01:05:42,343 --> 01:05:47,486
It's not safe to drive further Madam.,
There's fog and the visibility is minimal.

461
01:05:57,325 --> 01:06:00,329
You do what I say... yes sir.

462
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,435
Bala, there is no point in prolonging this.

463
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:06,534
I strongly feel this is our last chance.

464
01:06:09,103 --> 01:06:11,014
Please trust me.

465
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:48,584
How close the person who has to die will
decide the perfection of the crime we do.

466
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:10,668
Don't worry. It could have been some
animal... Nothing is to be seen there.

467
01:08:16,897 --> 01:08:21,539
The court has been convinced that the convict
has done the drama due to mental illness.

468
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:25,579
He has been sentenced to one
year of imprisonment, for this...

469
01:08:25,639 --> 01:08:29,553
...act of insanity, to be spent in
a government mental hospital.

470
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:35,122
The court also congratulates
Commissioner Sreebala IPS...

471
01:08:35,182 --> 01:08:39,688
...and ACP Xylex Abraham for
bringing out the truth.

472
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:08,125
I had seen Melvin for the first time on one
such day... So many days... so many questions...

473
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:13,359
but still there is one question
that remains unanswered.

474
01:09:14,388 --> 01:09:15,924
Why did he do all these?

475
01:09:16,724 --> 01:09:22,868
But one thing I am sure
All the answers were in Melvin's smile..

476
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,518
Shall we go sister?

477
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,827
Okay. The papers will
be ready within a week.

478
01:11:07,067 --> 01:11:10,537
It's just that we haven't met like
this before. But I know Xylex well.

479
01:11:11,672 --> 01:11:15,518
It has been a long time since
I have seen you this happy.

480
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:17,583
Did you sign the documents?

481
01:11:17,878 --> 01:11:19,551
Asha knows everything.

482
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:23,652
In fact, it was she and her
husband who helped me the most.

483
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,675
I'm on the way to the airport...
it's all because of you, Ma'am.

484
01:11:43,937 --> 01:11:46,076
Hey...it's part of our job.

485
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:49,748
You should see everything
as a nightmare only.

486
01:11:50,444 --> 01:11:54,392
Even your relationship with Sherin.

487
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:57,553
Ma'am.. I didn't get you.
Who's this Sherin?

488
01:11:58,952 --> 01:12:00,659
Is this some kind of a joke?

489
01:12:01,055 --> 01:12:03,399
I am talking about
Sherin, Melvin's wife.

490
01:12:03,724 --> 01:12:05,704
He did all this after knowing
about your relationship.

491
01:12:06,126 --> 01:12:08,072
Ma'am, who told you this?

492
01:12:08,395 --> 01:12:10,534
I have never seen this
Sherin in my whole life.

493
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:13,837
And that guy Melvin.. I have
seen him 12 years back".

494
01:12:13,901 --> 01:12:16,814
...while in college and now,
at this get together.

495
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:21,453
I am already late I have to rush.
The flight is at 12 O'clock.

496
01:13:44,691 --> 01:13:48,730
There were no features of
chronic drug abuse in her body.

497
01:13:49,797 --> 01:13:53,472
But at the time of death, drugs
was found in a heavy dose.

498
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:55,610
We felt so during autopsy.

499
01:13:55,969 --> 01:13:58,779
Likewise, the injuries when
one falls on their own...

500
01:13:58,839 --> 01:14:01,683
...and when someone else pushes
to death are different.

501
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:06,522
The injuries on the victim was like she was
deliberately pushed to death, from a height.

502
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,550
These were my findings, Madam.

503
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:13,929
But there was heavy pressure to write it off
as an accident, from the higher authorities.

504
01:14:14,221 --> 01:14:16,861
I tried my level best... but who cares?

505
01:14:17,524 --> 01:14:19,936
Okay. Thank you doctor.

506
01:15:32,165 --> 01:15:33,143
Hello, Rajeev.

507
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:35,943
Ma'am... Xylex is clean.

508
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:38,545
Yeah, I know.

509
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:41,612
But someone is helping Melvin.

510
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,115
I have my own guesses about who it is.

511
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:51,294
Actually we didn't arrest Melvin.

512
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:54,221
He made us do that.

513
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,094
Why?

514
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,160
The answer is there in your question.

515
01:15:59,092 --> 01:16:01,868
I don't have to give you the answer.

516
01:16:44,338 --> 01:16:45,942
Sherin didn't die as a
result of an accident.

517
01:16:46,406 --> 01:16:49,353
She had no relationship with Emil.
That was not true.

518
01:16:50,243 --> 01:16:53,952
Often lies are more
powerful than the truth.

519
01:16:54,648 --> 01:17:00,155
That is why every lie becomes
a truth when it is said repeatedly.

520
01:17:01,655 --> 01:17:03,362
How did you kill Sherin?

521
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:06,770
What is the real story?

522
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:33,008
See Melvin, Angel's
performance in all the...

523
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:35,451
<i>...assessment exams this year
has been extremely</i> poor.

524
01:19:36,143 --> 01:19:39,317
So the board has decided
not to continue her.

525
01:19:41,214 --> 01:19:43,023
Please Madam... this won't happen again.

526
01:19:43,316 --> 01:19:45,796
This is what you say all the time.

527
01:19:48,088 --> 01:19:49,192
Let me talk to the board.

528
01:19:49,956 --> 01:19:51,094
But this is your last chance.

529
01:20:19,953 --> 01:20:26,199
Are you drinking milk, baby?
Come" sit on my lap.

530
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:31,869
Revathy had called you.

531
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:41,919
How many times we have been
insulted by the principal.

532
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:47,016
Give her some time, Melvin.
Things will be fine.

533
01:20:47,914 --> 01:20:49,894
I don't think so.

534
01:20:51,384 --> 01:20:58,359
I don't want to go to the school...

535
01:21:00,427 --> 01:21:01,838
Don't cry...

536
01:21:45,505 --> 01:21:50,113
We didn't find the kid. We thought
sir had picked her from the school.

537
01:21:55,548 --> 01:21:58,529
Melvin, bring two packets
of milk while coming.

538
01:21:59,252 --> 01:22:00,287
Okay.

539
01:22:00,954 --> 01:22:04,902
And tell her I'm cooking
her favourite noodles.

540
01:22:05,692 --> 01:22:06,397
To whom?

541
01:22:07,494 --> 01:22:08,905
To the baby.

542
01:22:09,396 --> 01:22:12,138
What? She is not with me.

543
01:22:12,465 --> 01:22:15,503
Sreekkuttan told me that
you had gone and picked her from school.

544
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,544
What are you saying, Sherin?

545
01:22:18,738 --> 01:22:22,185
I just got out of office...
How can I pick her then?

546
01:22:23,043 --> 01:22:25,023
Then where's she?

547
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:28,987
Don't be tense I will
check at her school.

548
01:22:31,418 --> 01:22:32,488
Don't worry.

549
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,352
Don't shout... I'm coming.

550
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:08,692
What happened sir?

551
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:10,733
My daughter hasn't reached home yet.

552
01:23:11,324 --> 01:23:18,765
The kids have all gone home...
there's none left here.. You may go now.

553
01:23:19,232 --> 01:23:21,041
Just look again what if inside...

554
01:23:21,434 --> 01:23:27,316
School has closed at the right, kids might have
gone for playing somewhere, You leave sir...

555
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:35,522
Wont allow to have 2 pegs peacefully...

556
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:19,762
You searched everywhere?
Okay... Thank you.

557
01:24:53,193 --> 01:24:58,768
Neither the school authorities
nor the police helped us.

558
01:24:59,532 --> 01:25:05,847
Only we were there to search for her.

559
01:25:10,543 --> 01:25:13,820
I got that book from her
room later in the evening.

560
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:17,751
Who's that?

561
01:26:29,522 --> 01:26:31,297
What happened sir?

562
01:26:32,492 --> 01:26:33,493
Nothing.

563
01:27:20,573 --> 01:27:25,420
There is a torturing method done to the
kids with lesser marks by the principal.

564
01:27:26,446 --> 01:27:29,518
Unfortunately Angel was their usual victim.

565
01:27:40,827 --> 01:27:43,000
It was the day when the results
of the exam had come out.

566
01:27:43,563 --> 01:27:45,634
The principal punished
Angel that day as well.

567
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:53,946
The principal left the school early as
she had another programme that afternoon.

568
01:27:55,642 --> 01:28:01,024
The kid fainted after not being
able to drink water for long.

569
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:13,421
Even when the last staff member
had gone from the school...

570
01:28:14,827 --> 01:28:20,641
...no one remembered that my
daughter was lying there.

571
01:28:26,506 --> 01:28:28,747
I wasn't aware that the kid
was there in the cage, sir.

572
01:28:32,111 --> 01:28:38,926
The Principal and the Manager
warned me that nothing should go out.

573
01:28:41,788 --> 01:28:44,928
I didn't know sir... I can
say this in any court.

574
01:29:00,006 --> 01:29:01,713
Who were they?

575
01:29:06,446 --> 01:29:08,357
Madam you know the
owner of the school.

576
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:14,489
He died in an accident
recently... Roney Varghese.

577
01:29:26,065 --> 01:29:30,070
I will kill you devil.

578
01:29:31,604 --> 01:29:34,016
Melvin, listen to me.

579
01:29:42,148 --> 01:29:46,654
They did everything to
hide the truth from all.

580
01:29:46,919 --> 01:29:49,456
The police also joined them.

581
01:29:50,022 --> 01:29:52,024
The things have changed
according to their order.

582
01:29:53,559 --> 01:29:59,737
Ma'am, listen to me".

583
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:10,453
Their next target was Sherin.

584
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:14,417
When they made her a drug
addict in her autopsy report...

585
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,927
...Sherin's death
became just an accident.

586
01:31:17,477 --> 01:31:19,684
From there, to the mental
hospital for a while.

587
01:31:20,913 --> 01:31:25,123
Nobody was ready to listen to me.

588
01:31:26,118 --> 01:31:27,654
Except one.

589
01:31:28,855 --> 01:31:30,459
It was your dad... Madam.

590
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:40,103
Sir, I haven't seen you before.

591
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,245
I don't know if you will save me.

592
01:31:42,969 --> 01:31:48,476
But please listen to me, sir.

593
01:32:06,192 --> 01:32:09,662
Hello Roney Sir... This is Sainuddeen here.

594
01:32:12,732 --> 01:32:17,181
Things are going out of hand sir.

595
01:32:19,138 --> 01:32:25,817
The principal and the manager
warned me that nothing should go out.

596
01:32:50,069 --> 01:32:55,542
Hello... ls everything ready, Roney sir?

597
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:59,216
Okay, I will bring it there.

598
01:33:05,251 --> 01:33:07,731
Shall I get you one more drink?
Yes...

599
01:33:38,618 --> 01:33:43,931
Sir, I've to call home... Can you give
me your phone? There's no balance in mine.

600
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:49,038
Why did you want to meet me urgently?

601
01:33:50,796 --> 01:33:54,369
There's a matter... it is confidential...

602
01:33:54,867 --> 01:33:55,902
One minute.

603
01:33:58,004 --> 01:34:00,143
Sreeni Sir... This is Sainuddeen here.

604
01:34:01,741 --> 01:34:03,812
Xylex sir wants to meet you.

605
01:34:04,076 --> 01:34:04,884
Where is he?

606
01:34:05,111 --> 01:34:05,885
He is there at the station.

607
01:34:06,412 --> 01:34:08,722
I will come soon

608
01:34:49,789 --> 01:34:52,895
Dad, do you know who is with him?

609
01:34:59,365 --> 01:35:01,276
She is Xylex Abraham's wife.

610
01:35:17,783 --> 01:35:19,729
He did the wrong thing.

611
01:35:20,352 --> 01:35:23,822
Why should I go to jail
after killing such a person?

612
01:35:26,392 --> 01:35:27,928
What do you mean?

613
01:36:21,781 --> 01:36:27,356
Thus Emil came home to attend the
get together; as per my plan.

614
01:36:30,222 --> 01:36:36,229
I wanted Uma to be with Emil,
while he is being kidnapped.

615
01:36:37,029 --> 01:36:39,771
For then, there was
another reason.

616
01:37:01,987 --> 01:37:07,460
Every missing case becomes sensational,
when the victim is a celebrity.

617
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,462
So I choose Uma.

618
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:32,487
I had left my phone in
the car for two reasons.

619
01:37:32,985 --> 01:37:35,898
One was to lead the police to me.

620
01:37:36,188 --> 01:37:40,432
Secondly, to bring Xylex Abraham
to the investigation team.

621
01:38:01,213 --> 01:38:03,591
Dad, I'm going. Now...

622
01:38:47,426 --> 01:38:53,308
My dad entering Anu's life as a vicar,
helping in the adoption matter,

623
01:38:54,199 --> 01:39:00,980
dealing things in a way to create doubt in
Xylex's mind, everything was as per our plan.

624
01:39:07,613 --> 01:39:09,490
Don't be tense about adopting.

625
01:39:09,682 --> 01:39:11,320
I have told her everything.

626
01:39:12,151 --> 01:39:14,461
Certain things will have
to be done out of the way.

627
01:39:15,287 --> 01:39:17,528
Let Xylex know about it all
after everything is fixed.

628
01:39:17,756 --> 01:39:18,734
Yes father...

629
01:39:20,392 --> 01:39:23,703
You will have to raise a
good amount by next week.

630
01:39:24,296 --> 01:39:25,707
I will let you know.

631
01:39:55,227 --> 01:40:02,236
The easiest way to deceive a person is
by creating a doubt in his mind.

632
01:40:03,068 --> 01:40:07,574
Leaving the paper at your office
was pan of that plan, Madam.

633
01:40:16,148 --> 01:40:19,220
Then what I needed was some time.

634
01:40:19,518 --> 01:40:25,662
I had to convince some with
a few stories... to settle some scores.

635
01:40:26,625 --> 01:40:30,596
He can't identify the spot as
they were buried in the night.

636
01:40:31,697 --> 01:40:36,146
The Lord pronounces the verdict directly
for some sins happening here in this world.

637
01:40:37,403 --> 01:40:40,316
Like Sainuddeen's death in the jail.

638
01:40:44,109 --> 01:40:48,524
But for some other crimes, the Lord
may not pronounce the sentence.

639
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:53,361
As they happen with
the Lord's knowledge.

640
01:40:56,221 --> 01:41:01,170
It was a God's messenger who
killed Roney for my Angel.

641
01:41:08,467 --> 01:41:11,277
Sir, have you seen a
messenger of God?

642
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:23,285
I have seen. I have touched
Like this...

643
01:41:30,589 --> 01:41:34,264
You killed him for me.

644
01:41:38,764 --> 01:41:44,112
Another person besides the two
of us know about that secret.

645
01:41:46,472 --> 01:41:49,078
You, Madam.

646
01:41:51,877 --> 01:41:56,189
All the secrets are with you.

647
01:42:16,368 --> 01:42:20,441
After doing all these, do
you think you can get away?

648
01:42:21,607 --> 01:42:28,217
I definitely believe so... because,
before the law, I am not the culprit.

649
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,118
It's you.

650
01:42:30,883 --> 01:42:35,127
There are no evidences in any of
the police files that I killed Roney.

651
01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:46,598
But I have proof of you killing Roney... and
Madam, for keeping mum after knowing about it.

652
01:42:48,867 --> 01:42:51,211
Killing a person itself is a big crime.

653
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:57,948
Even bigger a crime is when a
police officer tries to suppress it.

654
01:43:01,947 --> 01:43:04,518
So what about the principal?

655
01:43:37,316 --> 01:43:41,389
Melvin was a suspect who came
to us with a fabricated story.

656
01:43:42,854 --> 01:43:49,294
But when that story ends now, there were
many things that Melvin help us earn.

657
01:46:44,903 --> 01:46:46,576
TV NEW Impact:

658
01:46:46,738 --> 01:46:50,982
The chilling Angel murder case
gets into headlines once again.

659
01:46:53,011 --> 01:46:56,881
The body of the absconding
main accused in the case".

660
01:46:56,882 --> 01:47:01,160
...the Principal of the
school, was found today.

661
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:05,165
It is assumed that she had reached
the hills while hiding from the police.

662
01:47:05,624 --> 01:47:10,801
The accident could have been caused due to fog,
as per the primary assumption of the Police.

663
01:47:10,929 --> 01:47:12,806
So what about the principal?

664
01:47:36,154 --> 01:47:43,766
How close the person who has to die will
decide the perfection of the crime we do...

665
