1
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,833
STRAY

2
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,292
What did my baby
do in school today?

3
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,833
Papa, I danced today.

4
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:19,208
Really? I never knew
my baby could dance!

5
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,875
- We also sang songs!
- Very good.

6
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:25,250
I'll take my baby
for some ice cream!

7
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,708
Roshni, you are here?

8
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,167
I was looking for you over there.

9
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,542
Let's go home, it's getting late.

10
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:38,042
Grandmother!

11
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,458
Come over here, Roshni.

12
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,875
Where is my papa, grandmother?

13
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:50,542
Tell me, grandmother,
where is my papa?

14
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,250
Ask your mother.

15
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:00,875
Roshni, why do you ask this
question? I've told you not to.

16
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,333
I've often told you
that your Papa...

17
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,333
is dead.

18
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,667
- Maid, take her away.
- Yes.

19
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,917
Let's go baby.

20
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,208
Mother.

21
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:29,292
For how long will we keep
hiding this from Roshni?

22
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,667
I think we should tell
her everything.

23
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,625
Don't you dare tell her!

24
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:37,875
Got it?

25
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:41,708
Mother, you put a garland
on grandma's picture every day.

26
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,750
But why isn't there a picture
of my father in this house?

27
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,458
So that even I can garland it.

28
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:56,000
Roshni, I've often told you not
to ask questions about your father!

29
00:03:56,083 --> 00:04:00,292
I am not a child mom. I have a
right to know about my father!

30
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,125
I also have the right to know,

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,458
whether I'm a legitimate
or an illegitimate child.

32
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,000
Roshni don't you dare.

33
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,917
Don't you dare call yourself
an illegitimate child.

34
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,875
Then why don't you
tell me about him?

35
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,167
- Was he a bad person?
- He was not a bad person.

36
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:16,917
Then what is it, mom?

37
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,542
I am tired! I am tired of you.

38
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,167
I am tired of your questions.

39
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:27,667
You keep asking me the same question.
You've made my life miserable!

40
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,500
Do you want to kill me?
If you asked this question again,

41
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,208
- I'll never talk to you again.
- Sorry, mom.

42
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:39,333
- I'm sorry, mom.
- I'll never ask again.

43
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,542
Sorry, mom. I will
never ask you again.

44
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,417
Anything special?

45
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,375
Yes. My mother lied years ago.

46
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,625
I've reached my grave
trying to keep up with it.

47
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,167
I have cancer.

48
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:11,625
I have very little time.

49
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,542
My end is near.

50
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:19,833
That's why I'm requesting you
to take Roshni to Mumbai with you.

51
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,958
So she learns to live without me.

52
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:48,042
Roshni, what's the matter?

53
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:52,500
What's the matter, child?

54
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:58,833
Since childhood, I feel things
are kept hidden from me.

55
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,708
Kept from you?
You are getting it wrong child.

56
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:08,667
- Nothing is being kept from you.
- What were you and Mom discussing?

57
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:17,792
Nothing. I was just asking her that
how long will you keep a pretty,

58
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:23,000
talented girl locked down here.

59
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,667
- Who are you talking about?
- You!

60
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,125
I know you sing very well.

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,042
You call my humming, singing?

62
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:37,208
What we have to see
is what I call singing,

63
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:42,250
and you call humming. What do
people in Bombay think of it?

64
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,417
Bombay?

65
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,625
Yes! You're coming to Bombay
with me right now.

66
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,625
- But uncle.
- You have to come.

67
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,042
There is no way out!

68
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,625
- Mother.
- I've spoken to her.

69
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,042
- Seeta.
- Yes, sir?

70
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,167
Quickly pack baby's stuff.

71
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,208
It's such a lovely house.

72
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,417
You like it?

73
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,542
Your room is upstairs,
to the left.

74
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:56,125
- What's wrong?
- There's somebody upstairs.

75
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,542
- Who is it?
- A boy.

76
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:00,875
A boy?

77
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,292
Not just a boy, a handsome boy.

78
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,000
- Rahul, when did you arrive?
- This morning.

79
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,917
Roshni, meet him. He's Rahul.

80
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,708
We've met. I mean banged
into each other.

81
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:31,292
If you don't mind,
I'll introduce myself.

82
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,667
My name is Rahul.

83
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,708
Rahul Malhotra.

84
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,375
Occupation is export-import trade.
Some times in Delhi, sometimes in Bombay.

85
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,083
London, Paris, Hong Kong,

86
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,625
and at times in the bathroom.

87
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,958
The only son of Ahuja
uncle's friend.

88
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,417
And most important, single.

89
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,417
- Now your turn.
- Pardon?

90
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,000
Tell me about yourself.

91
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,917
She's my niece.

92
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,917
Now, she'll stay with me.

93
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,875
Actually I want your
suggestion about her.

94
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,542
She has always been very
fond of music and singing.

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,125
Now you tell us, what to do?
How to go about it?

96
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,792
Uncle, Please.
Do you have to do this today?

97
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,125
Correct. Not today,
we'll do it now.

98
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,250
Just watch me!

99
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:42,833
How are you?
I'm calling from Bombay.

100
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:48,583
I have a friend who
sings beautifully.

101
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,833
Her voice is like a golden bell.

102
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,750
Tomorrow? At 11?

103
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,125
I'll come over with her.

104
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,750
Your job is done.
You'll have an audition in HMV.

105
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,083
The day after you'll record a song.
The next day you'll be a star.

106
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,625
What do you think?

107
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,542
But you never heard me singing.

108
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,667
- Then?
- We'll hear you now.

109
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,917
An upcoming singer will sing
for you today.

110
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,875
Excellent, Roshni!

111
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,875
After years, I've
heard such a song.

112
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm confident you'll
become a great singer.

113
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:46,583
We'll record your song very soon.

114
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:53,000
Your job is done.
Now may I leave to do my work?

115
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,208
- Where?
- New York. Want to come?

116
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:03,458
If not New York,
at least come to the airport.

117
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,750
I want to say something.

118
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,958
I'll never forget your
act of beneficence.

119
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,917
Just because of you,
I have confidence in myself.

120
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:25,500
Just wait for what lies ahead.
Today I'm talking to a singer.

121
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,083
When I'll return,
I'll be meeting a star.

122
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:33,250
Roshni, sky is the limit now.

123
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:50,833
It's up! Your Roshni's
poster has been put up!

124
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,375
See, it's such a huge poster.

125
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:55,417
Call her your sister-in-law!

126
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,958
It's been two years, you
have gone crazy about her.

127
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,875
She hasn't even
looked at you once.

128
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,833
And you dream of marrying her!

129
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,208
We are black marketers.
We'll sell tickets, two for five.

130
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:12,750
Yes, we will. But before that
I'll purchase 200 tickets,

131
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,900
Two hundred?

132
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,375
I will earn a lot of money.
Make a garland of it.

133
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,167
And will put it around
my darling's neck.

134
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,500
And then you'll beg. Do you think
200 tickets are 200 peanuts?

135
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,250
- Where will you get the
money from? -It will come.

136
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,125
- Where have you brought me?
- It's nothing.

137
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,792
Only two men fighting.

138
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,583
- Nothing is going to happen.
- Let's go back.

139
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,220
- We'll be in unnecessary
trouble. -Let's go.

140
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,625
OK, OK.

141
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,800
Where are you going now?

142
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,417
Be quiet.

143
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,917
Jaggu, where have you brought me?
This seems a dangerous place.

144
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,333
Let's run away.

145
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,792
Pakya, 500 bucks can be turned
into 5000 here.

146
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:05,458
You'll get your bones
crushed in return. Let's go.

147
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,583
Let him go home.

148
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,940
Excellent moves, my
braveheart, excellent.

149
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,040
Let's go, come.

150
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,333
Keep quiet. Let's ask
him the current rate.

151
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,680
No. Listen to me.
What are you trying to do?

152
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,500
Hey, brother,

153
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,583
- what's the rate?
- I will give 30 for one.

154
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,900
- It's too little.
- Be quiet.

155
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,875
- Just this much?
- What else do you want?

156
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
Come on.

157
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,208
I'll fight him.

158
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,750
- Are you crazy?
- Be quiet.

159
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:57,917
Stop! This fair boy will
fight our macho man.

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,708
Anybody 30 to one?

161
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:08,167
- I say the odds are one to 50.
- Look at that macho man.

162
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,708
He has already knocked down previous
candidate. He'll kill you and me too.

163
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,208
It's better to sit outside
the temple and beg.

164
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,833
Be quiet!

165
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,042
- Brothers...
- We are going.

166
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,542
- No, no.
- We are leaving.

167
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:25,250
- Why aren't we leaving?
- Pakya will give 50 for one.

168
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,833
- You'll have me killed.
- Collect the money.

169
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,280
Fifty for one.

170
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,333
- There are no rules in this fight.
- What are you talking about?

171
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,542
Anyone can hit anywhere. Got it?

172
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,250
Listen, brother.

173
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,833
Look, both of us
want to earn money.

174
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,917
I have such a lovely face
so go easy on me.

175
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,542
Now, you are over.

176
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,583
I'll straight away break you.
You get away.

177
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,208
I'm requesting you. What!
You have turned into a sparrow now.

178
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,708
I have such a lovely face.

179
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,625
- Come shake hands.
- You want to shake hands?

180
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,250
Yeah, let's shake hands.

181
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,375
Awesome, Jeva. Awesome.

182
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,417
I told you to go easy on me.

183
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,583
If I lost it, it'll
cause you some damage.

184
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,000
You hit me on my face!

185
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,180
You have ruined your face.

186
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,042
- Collected the money?
- A little left.

187
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,417
What are you talking about?

188
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,042
I'll collect the cash.
You go and fight.

189
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,333
What are you talking about.
We'll get nothing for me!

190
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,417
- Don't be scared.
- He hits hard.

191
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,667
Hundred for one.
100 for one.

192
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,583
On the face!

193
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,250
This guy only hits on the face.

194
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:19,042
I told you not once but twice
I won't say it for the third time.

195
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,750
It's a lover's face. Go easy.

196
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,750
If I lost it.

197
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,833
- Oh it's you?
- Why don't you go, hit him?

198
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,458
That rascal even kicks on the face.
Has my rate gone up?

199
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,417
- Got a lot of money.
- You don't say.

200
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,708
He hits a lot. Let's leave.

201
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,917
Who will pay for the
bets? Your Pop?

202
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,917
They'll cremate me.
Go and fight. Go, go, go.

203
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,417
- I have your back.
- You have my back? OK I'll go.

204
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,583
- Hey you, what will you say?
- Jeva.

205
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:34,333
- Jaggu! Say Jaggu.
- Jaggu!

206
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,625
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

207
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,333
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

208
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,875
For all alcoholics.

209
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:19,583
For all alcoholics..
This is the ultimate abode.

210
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:24,625
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

211
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:29,625
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

212
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,250
For all alcoholics..
This is the ultimate abode.

213
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:22,167
It is bad to drink but what
should an alcoholic do.

214
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:27,083
Some are troubled by their poverty
while some are sick of their money.

215
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:32,167
So what if this is poison.
It is medicine for all ailments.

216
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,750
They jump out of joy
when they pop the cork.

217
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,167
Some lost gamble while some
got beaten by sorrow.

218
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:46,000
This is that place.

219
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,583
Which is visited by everyone.

220
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:53,417
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

221
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:58,917
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

222
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,220
HOUSE
FULL

223
00:21:55,958 --> 00:22:00,167
Lovers come here more
without any objective.

224
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:05,542
This wine puts
everything at rest.

225
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:10,042
Whether it is lover's
betrayal or a separation.

226
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:15,375
Can't forget those moments they recall
those times by having a wine.

227
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:19,833
This fire and water is their life.

228
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:24,875
They have an old relation with this place.

229
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,375
They have an old relation with this place.

230
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,417
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

231
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:19,875
Now I will tell you
the state of alcoholics.

232
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:24,542
It is fun times.
The lovers are swaying.

233
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:29,833
They are not aware
of what's happening around.

234
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:34,000
Cigarette isn't lit
but the finger is burnt.

235
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,917
Everyone is feeling tipsy.

236
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They wobble and hobble.

237
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,625
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

238
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:02,458
For all alcoholics..
This is the ultimate abode.

239
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:08,208
This is a tavern.
This is a tavern.

240
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,625
- Who is it?
- Flower delivery boy.

241
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,833
You?

242
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,667
The Calcutta police is strange.

243
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,375
They didn't let
me come on stage.

244
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,000
And garland for you.

245
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,820
This garland I wanted
to put around your neck

246
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,280
so I had to disturb you here.

247
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,250
You followed me from Bombay
to Delhi and now to Calcutta!

248
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,000
Why do you waste
so much of money?

249
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,958
I earn everything because of you.

250
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:00,208
I sell tickets of your show
in the black-market.

251
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,167
Earn money and offer it to you.

252
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:04,875
May I garland you?

253
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,708
Go!

254
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,625
Don't be crazy. Go on.

255
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,940
Go.

256
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:36,542
Look at this. Your daughter
has created a storm in India.

257
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:43,875
Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta.

258
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,000
All the photographs.

259
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,917
Who will believe
she is the same Roshni,

260
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:56,208
who first came to Bombay
with me a few months ago.

261
00:25:56,875 --> 00:26:00,333
That's a load off my chest today.
Now I can die in peace.

262
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,583
What nonsense.
Your enemies should die.

263
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:08,375
Oh, yes. Roshni has sent
a letter for you.

264
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:14,875
How are you mother?

265
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:19,833
I'm always worried about you.
I feel like meeting you.

266
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,458
But there's no time in Bombay.

267
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:26,833
There is one show after the other.

268
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:31,125
I'm very happy. The only thing
I miss is that same thing.

269
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:35,833
The question about my father
keeps striking my mind even today.

270
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,000
I am sorry mom.
Take care of yourself.

271
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,958
Miss you. Love, Roshni.

272
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:50,625
There are worlds beyond the stars.

273
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,708
There are many tests of love.
Congratulations, superstar.

274
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:58,792
- Hi, Rahul. Where are you calling from?
- I'm still in America.

275
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:02,083
Believe me, your songs
are super hit over here.

276
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:10,125
Since people found out I know you,
offers for shows are pouring in.

277
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,833
Really. That's great.

278
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,292
- What should I tell them?
- Say what you feel is right.

279
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:19,250
- I'll say you've agreed.
- You're confident of yourself.

280
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm confident about you.

281
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,042
Romance in the air.

282
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,458
Spending a lot on
international calls.

283
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,708
Sharma, I never waste time
or money without any reason.

284
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,125
This is an investment.

285
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,500
You have to invest to gain.

286
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:53,875
- Madam, how was your show?
- People appreciated it a lot.

287
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:59,708
Can you tell us the reason
for your success in a short time?

288
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:05,292
The people who love me
are responsible for my success.

289
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:13,458
Miss Roshni, when
will you get married?

290
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:17,458
- I haven't...
- Yes?

291
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,625
- I haven't thought about it.
- I'll tell you.

292
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,780
She'll get married as soon
as she finds a good boy.

293
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,000
I want to talk to you in private.

294
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,792
- Sit down.
- On one condition.

295
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,792
I'll pay the bill because
this is our first date.

296
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,917
Why do you follow me?

297
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,250
I love you.

298
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,667
What did you say?

299
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,458
Love, romance.

300
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,167
I want to marry you.

301
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:27,583
Listen! I know what you'll say.

302
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,542
How can we get married when
we don't know each other?

303
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,500
But 90% people in India
marry in this manner.

304
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,875
They get married, know each
other and then fall in love.

305
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,000
I know it's old fashioned
but I still like it.

306
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:45,667
If you ever follow me again,
I will kill you.

307
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:49,792
Listen to me. Think it over.

308
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:53,042
You won't find another
lover like me. Promise.

309
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,292
I've thought it out.

310
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:02,250
I won't let go so easily.

311
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:06,667
I'm a lover, your lover!

312
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,833
Where will I keep these?

313
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:22,000
- What's all this?
- Some admirer of yours sent these.

314
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,375
So many?

315
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,875
This is nothing. Go in and see.

316
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,375
You handle this. I'm off.

317
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,250
I AM YOUR LOVER

318
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:53,542
You are in my every dream.

319
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,250
You are in my every dream.

320
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:02,083
You are in my every dream.

321
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:06,292
You are in my every dream.

322
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,000
I am a part of your
beautiful thoughts

323
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:16,375
I am a part of your
beautiful thoughts.

324
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:21,500
I am a part of your
beautiful thoughts.

325
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:26,792
In exchange for the color

326
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:32,542
I want to fill my
heart with blood.

327
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:38,167
I am your lover.

328
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:44,583
I am your lover.

329
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,083
I want to love you.

330
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:55,292
In those deep eyes of yours

331
00:31:55,375 --> 00:32:00,125
I want to drown.

332
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:05,625
I am your lover.

333
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:15,750
I want to love you.

334
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,840
I AM YOUR LOVER

335
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:02,625
There are many ways
to come and go.

336
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:06,500
There are many ways
to come and go.

337
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:17,750
But I left all those paths.

338
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:21,417
For your sake.

339
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,375
I just want to walk.

340
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:31,042
Past your lane.

341
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:36,125
I am your lover.

342
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,667
I want to love you.

343
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,083
Take my name and
attach it with yours.

344
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,042
Take my name and
attach it with yours.

345
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,542
Or break my heart
and set me free.

346
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:48,375
Or break my heart
and set me free.

347
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:52,708
I want to live my
life pleasing you.

348
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:58,000
I want to live my
life pleasing you.

349
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,667
I am your lover.

350
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,542
I want to love you.

351
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:16,625
In those deep eyes of yours

352
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:21,667
I want to drown.

353
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:32,042
I am your lover.

354
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,000
- Sit down.
- On one condition.

355
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,460
I will pay the bill.

356
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,542
So you want to marry me?

357
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,708
It's easy to nod your head
but have you ever thought,

358
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:11,542
how can a black marketer like
you marry a girl like me?

359
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,750
The only difference
between you and me is.

360
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,083
You have a car and I don't.

361
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:25,000
You have a bungalow,
an air-conditioned bedroom.

362
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,333
Lots of dresses etc.

363
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:31,250
Absolutely right.
I have my own style of living.

364
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:35,125
My own life style
and I'm used to it.

365
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:37,667
You mean these petty things,

366
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,375
are stopping you
from marrying me?

367
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,667
OK. Let's make a
list of those things.

368
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:47,750
Things without which you
can't live. Car with driver.

369
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,833
A house with a garden.

370
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,125
Servants in uniform.
Bedroom with an air conditioner.

371
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,792
Clothes with jewels.
And a husband with love.

372
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,792
That's me. Anything else?

373
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:03,125
Oh no! This is enough.

374
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,250
It will take you seven births
to earn that list you made.

375
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,167
Let's see how much time it takes.

376
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:15,792
But I challenge you.
Up until I don't get these things,

377
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,292
I won't meet you again.

378
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,167
Forget her. You're mad!

379
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,750
Compare yourselves.
We are black marketers.

380
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,292
She is right.
Make us some snack.

381
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:38,042
There's an international match today.
Let's sell tickets in black.

382
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,458
- We'll earn lots of money!
- I got it.

383
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:42,708
What did you find?

384
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,750
I have an idea.

385
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,833
Arrangements will be made to
earn money for my darling.

386
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:03,667
God! He's here again.

387
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:09,042
The first item in your list.
Mercedes with a driver.

388
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,792
- Come on.
- No, thank you.

389
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,792
Come. Come.

390
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,250
Look at it properly.
The second item in your list.

391
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,500
House with a swimming pool.

392
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:24,917
Come.

393
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:31,667
The third item, a bedroom
with an air conditioner.

394
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,708
And these dresses with jewels.

395
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:37,917
Have a look.

396
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:43,458
- Good day, madam.
- This is item number four.

397
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:45,708
Servants in uniform.

398
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
So what do you think?

399
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,542
Come with me.
Where did you get all this?

400
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:56,500
- I stole it.
- Stole!

401
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:00,958
Yes. Looks like you don't read
the paper. Look at this.

402
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,708
A bank was robbed by me.

403
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,333
I bought all this with that cash.

404
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:10,458
I have all the receipts.

405
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,542
You robbed a bank! But why?

406
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:21,458
It would take me seven births
to earn those items honestly.

407
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,875
This was the only way
to fulfill it. Theft.

408
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:28,750
Fool! Idiot! You can be jailed.

409
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:34,083
I know that. But I did
this only to tell you.

410
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:39,833
I love you!
I can do anything for you.

411
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,875
I can earn this honestly
but give me some time.

412
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:49,583
The police is here?

413
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,583
But it's my challenge
they can't catch me.

414
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:55,917
- May I escape?
- You won't run away!

415
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:57,750
You'll surrender to the police.

416
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,792
If I go to jail,
all my plans will fail.

417
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,000
- I'm running.
- I said, you won't run.

418
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,417
OK, I'll go to jail
on one condition.

419
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:13,792
That you will come to
meet me in jail every week.

420
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,708
Caught him!

421
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,917
I've been looking for you.
I have a warrant for you.

422
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,833
Promise me, madam.

423
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,333
Otherwise I'll
escape in a second.

424
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:42,625
- Now say, will you come?
- I'll come.

425
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,958
Now it's fine. It's a
matter concerning the heart.

426
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:53,125
- Now, it's fine.
- OK, let's go.

427
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:59,667
Will you come? She's my girl.
Let me romance with her.

428
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:15,583
Where were you?
I've been looking for you.

429
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:20,083
What's the matter?
Is everything fine?

430
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,000
Lie! Why did you lie?

431
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:34,333
Why do you keep hiding things?
Why do you keep the truth from me?

432
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,958
Why didn't you say you were sick?

433
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,833
Sent me to Bombay!
So that you could lie here alone.

434
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,333
- Why did you not tell me?
- Come my baby.

435
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,917
I've told you many lies.

436
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:09,042
I hid the truth all my life.

437
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:14,917
Now I have very little time.

438
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,625
You want to know
about your father?

439
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:29,875
So listen.

440
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:38,583
His name is Prakash.

441
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,208
Prakash Chadha.

442
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:53,875
He had come here
from Mauritius on business.

443
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:59,917
Your father was a good lawyer
in addition to being a businessman.

444
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:04,292
We first met at
Deccan Bridge Club.

445
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,583
I don't know what it was

446
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:13,292
that attracted us to each other.

447
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:17,917
One meeting led to another.

448
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,750
Then the third.

449
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:26,875
We never even realized

450
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:31,250
when we fell in love.

451
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:39,000
We quietly got
married in a temple.

452
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,750
The day after the wedding,

453
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:49,417
for some official work,

454
00:43:51,292 --> 00:43:52,458
he had to go to Delhi.

455
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,333
I was left alone.

456
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,500
He had promised me that

457
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:06,042
he would return in
four to five days.

458
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,083
He would take me to Mauritius.

459
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,167
But he never returned.

460
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,708
Nor did we get any news of him.

461
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,417
There were headlines
in the newspaper.

462
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:26,917
Prakash Chadha has
misappropriated government funds.

463
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:31,667
My mother became a
wall between us.

464
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:35,875
Your father tried to contact me.

465
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:39,333
But my mother never told me.

466
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,875
I was expecting you.

467
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:49,833
After your birth,
I tried looking for him.

468
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:54,792
But I couldn't find him.

469
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:57,292
Whatever the world says,

470
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:04,875
but my heart tells me
that he is innocent.

471
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,125
He is innocent, my child.

472
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:18,042
My child...

473
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,208
Mr. Prakash Chadha,
you are all alone today?

474
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:07,542
What's wrong?

475
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,958
After so many years,
I don't know why.

476
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:16,500
I'm missing my
country and my people.

477
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:25,292
I'll go search for my Papa.

478
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:30,542
Prakash Chadha's family
lived in Mauritius.

479
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:35,375
We don't know if
they are still there.

480
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,542
I have their old address.

481
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:47,292
Roshni, I would have
accompanied you,

482
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:53,167
But your mother's will and the
matter of your inheritance.

483
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:56,042
Also needs to be sorted out.

484
00:46:56,708 --> 00:47:00,042
Don't worry. I'll manage.

485
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:04,833
The good news is,

486
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,458
Rahul is in Mauritius these days.

487
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:14,708
I'll call him up.
He'll receive you at the airport.

488
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,292
I apologize for troubling you.

489
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:52,542
It's no trouble. When you do really
trouble me, then you may apologize.

490
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:56,500
How did you suddenly decide
to come to Mauritius?

491
00:47:56,833 --> 00:48:00,375
I'll tell you in the evening.
Right now just leave me at the hotel.

492
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:04,000
If this is the case,
I'll move earth and heaven,

493
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:07,792
to find your uncle and father.

494
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,750
I swear by this flame.

495
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:13,958
What are you doing?
You'll burn your hand.

496
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,792
Let it burn. It's just a hand.

497
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:21,792
- Rahul?
- What's the emergency?

498
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,792
- What is it?
- Good Morning, Madam.

499
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,792
- You have to go to Paris.
- I have already told you.

500
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:33,208
- I won't go anywhere.
- Sir, we'll lose a huge order.

501
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:34,583
So be it!

502
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,375
If we don't get the order now
we'll never get it!

503
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,833
We'll lose a lot!
Madam, you explain to him.

504
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:44,542
He must go. I've also
booked the ticket!

505
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:48,750
My staying here too is essential.
You don't see money every time!

506
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:51,708
Relations too count. You may go.

507
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:55,083
I'm elder to you. I won't
let you suffer losses...

508
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:11,875
- Because of me you... -Don't you
dare talk of profit and loss!

509
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,583
- I swear I'll burn my hand...
- No!

510
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,583
What else will you promise
by burning your hand?

511
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:32,542
That I never lose your hand
and your companionship.

512
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:47,500
Great acting, I enjoyed it.

513
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,667
That's OK but I'm fed up.
Are we going to work or not?

514
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:56,917
The time is ripe. Just watch.

515
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:01,125
We'll do business
as well as make money.

516
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,542
And enjoy ourselves too!

517
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
What did you say?

518
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:10,458
What's the name of that singer?

519
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,875
- Call her sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!

520
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:17,042
She will come to
meet you every week.

521
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:21,292
- Where is she? Tell me!
- Don't add salt to injury.

522
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:23,333
Otherwise I will escape.

523
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:28,042
And if I escape,
you'll lose your uniform!

524
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:32,958
I'm here for your sister-in-law
or I'd have escaped long ago.

525
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,333
Terrible! I'm dead!

526
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:42,125
Why are you alive? Jaggu escaped!

527
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,125
Find him. He must be around!

528
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,292
You go there. You follow me.

529
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:56,999
A tall man escaped
from the police station.

530
00:50:57,099 --> 00:50:58,199
Have you seen him?

531
00:50:58,292 --> 00:50:59,583
Why don't you say anything?

532
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:14,125
As long as I live.

533
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:21,542
I will keep drinking like this.

534
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:28,208
Companion give me more to drink.

535
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:37,292
The lips are thirsty.

536
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:42,542
The heart is on fire.

537
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:48,917
The lips are thirsty
The heart is on fire.

538
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:53,917
One sip and I've passed out.

539
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:59,667
Ever since I became a
little notorious.

540
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:04,042
Ever since I became a
little notorious.

541
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:08,583
By God, I became very famous.

542
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,208
By God, I became very famous.

543
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:32,042
I became very famous.

544
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:17,958
I lived in palaces
I lived on streets

545
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:22,083
I lived in palaces
I lived on streets.

546
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:27,125
I saw many jails
and won many games.

547
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:31,500
But I lost my heart
when I fell in love.

548
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:40,792
This was going to happen to me.

549
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:45,833
By God, I became very famous.

550
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:39,333
That mesmerizing beauty.

551
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:48,042
She was like a cool breeze.

552
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:52,500
The day I laid my eyes on her
I made a promise.

553
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:02,583
From today on I am your slave

554
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:07,000
I swear by God
I became very famous.

555
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,875
Like a lost person.

556
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:03,750
When you want to sleep
Take some rest.

557
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:08,625
Nobody knows what
tomorrow will bring.

558
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:17,042
But tonight we are well prepared.

559
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:22,250
I swear by God
I became very famous.

560
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:29,958
Ever since I became
a little notorious.

561
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,292
I swear by God
I became very famous.

562
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:59,375
- Jaggu, don't run!
- Get away!

563
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:04,250
How far will you run?
I won't spare you!

564
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:10,333
Forgive me constable.
I will never run.

565
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:14,917
- It's me, me. -Oh, you?
Pakya you almost killed me!

566
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:18,792
How long will you keep running?
Someday you will be caught.

567
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,625
So what do I do? But I have
to meet your sister-in-law.

568
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,458
What do I do!

569
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:28,542
There's one idea which
will save me from the police.

570
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:32,375
And I'll be able to earn some
money for her every day.

571
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,083
Then do one thing. Go abroad.

572
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:39,833
You get lots of money there.
Will you go to Hong Kong?

573
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:43,500
I know Chadha uncle.
I will work something out.

574
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:44,583
I'll go.

575
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:07,208
So you've also come from India
in search of work.

576
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:09,708
What will you do?

577
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:13,917
- Anything, sir.
- What does that mean?

578
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:18,792
I asked what work? Something
straightforward or a fraud?

579
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,833
I wanted to be straightforward.

580
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:26,333
But everything went wrong
and I had to escape here.

581
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,375
Helplessly!

582
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:32,917
You are absolutely right!

583
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:37,167
Man runs from his dear ones
only when he's helpless.

584
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:40,583
Come and sit down.

585
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:48,000
Shall I tell you something?
Everyone has to run in life.

586
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:51,583
Sometimes from himself
or circumstances.

587
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:55,625
It's another matter that
some get tired of running.

588
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,579
And some like me,
pretend to forget life

589
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:00,599
with the help of alcohol.

590
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,542
- What's your angle?
- I'm not from the tired ones.

591
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,750
I'll earn a decent living here.

592
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:14,458
Go back, finish my sentence
and then marry my love.

593
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:20,458
Like me, you're also
a heart patient.

594
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:27,417
You can work for me till
you don't find another job.

595
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:29,708
With hard work and honor!

596
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:35,583
Roshni, I've found your uncle.

597
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:46,375
I don't deny that.
Maybe you are Prakash's daughter.

598
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:48,792
But how does that concern me?

599
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:51,667
And why have you come to me?

600
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,167
What can I do?

601
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:59,708
You can tell me where he is.

602
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:03,917
I don't know!
Nor do I want to know!

603
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:08,042
Whatever name my ancestors
had earned in this city.

604
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,333
He ruined that name!

605
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:14,875
We were destroyed!
My father died of a heart attack!

606
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:20,167
He couldn't take the shock.
And it was all because of him!

607
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,292
He is dead for us!

608
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,875
- But Uncle.
- I'm not your uncle! Understood?

609
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,083
You are my uncle!

610
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,333
Because my father
is your brother.

611
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:39,667
The same blood runs
through my veins as yours!

612
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:42,458
We share a blood relation.

613
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:48,667
You are lying! You know where
my father is. Whether he's alive?!

614
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:55,958
Place your hand on my head once
and say you know nothing.

615
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,250
Then I'll never ask you anything!

616
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,333
Come with me.

617
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,875
Five years ago when
our mother was sick.

618
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:21,917
He left this number.
I don't know if he's still there.

619
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:25,208
- What number is this?
- Of Hong Kong.

620
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:39,208
Hello.

621
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,667
I'm calling from Mauritius.

622
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:46,667
May I talk to Prakash Chadha?

623
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:50,000
- Who is calling?
- Please give him the phone.

624
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:54,125
- Tell him it's from Mauritius.
- Just hang on.

625
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:12,583
- Father?
- Father?

626
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:17,417
Father, I'm your daughter.

627
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,458
Mother told me about
you before she died.

628
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:27,500
So far I never knew
you were alive.

629
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:36,125
Listen, I don't know what
your mother told you.

630
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,875
But I know I have
nothing to do with this.

631
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,625
Father, don't disconnect!

632
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:49,542
I beg you, Father.

633
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:53,542
Please, listen to me.

634
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:02,292
My mother was Sharda Devi.

635
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:05,875
She lived in Poona.

636
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:10,250
- In Poona?
- Do you recall?

637
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:34,583
Some crazy girl says,
"I'm her father."

638
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,292
I have no daughter.

639
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,917
Think with a cool mind.

640
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,042
Maybe he's not your father.

641
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,500
Maybe but it's also possible
that he is my father.

642
01:04:04,879 --> 01:04:06,859
That's why, he denied it.

643
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:11,375
I want to go to Hong Kong.

644
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,167
Can you help me?

645
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,625
Sure.

646
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:30,000
I too have work there.
I'll come with you.

647
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:36,125
You finish packing.
I'll arrange for the tickets.

648
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,083
Here's the packet.

649
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:39,167
Are you ready?

650
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:46,625
We are leaving by
tonight's flight.

651
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:50,792
- Where are you?
- I'm in the bathroom.

652
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,917
- Did you pack your bags?
- It's near the table.

653
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,542
Talked to Ahuja uncle?

654
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,833
Yeah, I told him everything.
Also you're going with me.

655
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,208
He was very happy.

656
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:18,792
Who won't be happy
going with a star?

657
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:25,917
It will give me a chance
to meet your father,

658
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:28,583
and we will have another show too.

659
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:39,792
I am ready.

660
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:44,875
I too am ready.

661
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:47,042
Will you always
support me like this?

662
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:58,458
We must reach the airport.
Don't you have to go to Hong Kong?

663
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:19,379
Roshni, see I have no luggage.

664
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:23,542
You get a trolley and
bring your luggage.

665
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:25,292
I have some calls to make.

666
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,167
I'll explain in your language.
Is this bag yours?

667
01:09:01,917 --> 01:09:03,000
Yes it is.

668
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:07,750
- Do you know what's in it?
- Yes, I know.

669
01:09:11,042 --> 01:09:13,417
Did you leave the bag
with a stranger?

670
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:15,292
Or was it open anywhere?

671
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:17,139
No.

672
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:23,750
Sign your statement.

673
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,458
What's the combination
number of this bag?

674
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,542
Is this yours?

675
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:49,958
- Are these keys yours?
- Yes, they are.

676
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:53,542
Look here! Is this yours?

677
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,250
- Is this also yours?
- Yes.

678
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:06,875
- Is this also yours? Answer me.
- Yes.

679
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,625
And this?

680
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:14,875
Whose is this?

681
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:19,083
Answer us, whose is this?

682
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:23,375
- Answer me.
- No, it's not mine!

683
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:27,792
When all these things are yours,
why isn't the cocaine?

684
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:31,083
Answer me! Why isn't this yours?

685
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,159
Do you know the penalty for drug
smuggling in Hong Kong is death?

686
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,239
A death penalty!

687
01:10:57,667 --> 01:11:01,875
Madam, what have you decided?

688
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:08,500
Do you admit you brought drugs here
for personal use and were caught?

689
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:16,958
- Please call Rahul...
- You are lying.

690
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:22,417
No man named Rahul came
with you from Mauritius.

691
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:26,375
We've checked the complete
airline passenger list.

692
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,917
The man sitting next
to you was Anand Saxena!

693
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:34,083
He's a South African
dealing in diamonds.

694
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,292
Why don't you understand?

695
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:44,750
Admit to your crime if you
want to save your skin.

696
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:50,833
Or I will prove that you
are a drug smuggler!

697
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:53,917
For which the
punishment is death!

698
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:01,917
When I have not committed the
crime, why must I admit it?

699
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,917
So this is your decision?
Very well.

700
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,679
Very well.

701
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:21,458
There will be a case
and we'll meet in the court.

702
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:26,208
And I will prove you smuggled
drugs in our country!

703
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:29,042
- I'm innocent. -And you'll
be sentenced to death!

704
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,679
- I am innocent!
- Death Sentence!

705
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:34,039
I am innocent!

706
01:14:29,417 --> 01:14:32,208
Look, crying won't help.

707
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,042
At first all this
will appear filthy.

708
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:43,500
Then you'll get used to it.

709
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:47,208
Then you'll like it.

710
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,500
This stench,

711
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:56,458
will smell nice later.

712
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,417
That's better.

713
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,417
You're very brave.

714
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:15,542
When I first came here,
I thought I would die.

715
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,875
I cried for weeks.

716
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,292
What's your name?

717
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:27,167
My name is Angela.

718
01:15:27,583 --> 01:15:30,792
I'm from Calcutta.
I've been here for two months.

719
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:34,625
I won't stay for long.

720
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:37,542
Why? Will you be released?

721
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,167
They will shoot me.

722
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,875
I was caught smuggling drugs.

723
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:51,792
They proved my crime.

724
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,333
Now, I await death.

725
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,333
Somebody is here to see you.

726
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:18,739
Me?

727
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:23,083
Father...

728
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,042
What are you doing here?

729
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:44,500
I ran away from Bombay.

730
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:47,792
I told you the police
can't harm me.

731
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:53,542
But how did you get caught?

732
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:02,167
Forget it.

733
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:06,625
It's the job of the police
to catch us but we must escape.

734
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,625
But hear one thing.

735
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:15,000
As long as I'm alive
I won't let you be harmed.

736
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:19,125
These Chinese can't harm you.

737
01:17:20,542 --> 01:17:22,042
I'll take you away from here.

738
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,708
If you can do anything for me,

739
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:31,333
get me a lawyer.

740
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:36,042
I'll get ten. Anything else?

741
01:17:39,167 --> 01:17:41,833
There's a Prakash Chadha here.

742
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,083
I'd spoken to him
over the telephone.

743
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:47,583
He's probably my father.

744
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:51,667
I had his phone number.
Now I don't know where...

745
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:54,375
I came here looking for him.

746
01:17:55,458 --> 01:18:01,042
Can you locate him and tell
him his daughter is in jail?

747
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:04,833
Yes, I'll bring him.

748
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,375
Before I leave,

749
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:19,125
I bought this for you.
We have an old connection.

750
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:21,375
Keep it.

751
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,333
Money is great.

752
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:28,833
It speaks every language.

753
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:30,625
Please, keep it.

754
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:36,667
I will go now.

755
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:50,542
- Jaggu, where are you coming from?
- I've brought a case for you.

756
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:58,625
- Tell me do you want to take it?
- What's the case?

757
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:01,833
An Indian girl has been caught
in the drug smuggling case.

758
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:04,000
- We have to release her.
- Who is going to pay the money?

759
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:06,792
- Does she have any close relatives here?
- Yes, heard her father is here.

760
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,583
What is her father's name?

761
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,792
Her father's name is
Prakash Chadha.

762
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:24,458
Yes, Roshni is your daughter.
I just met her.

763
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:29,167
She's in Hong Kong jail.
She needs her father.

764
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:32,917
In jail? For what?

765
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:34,958
Go and ask her.

766
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:42,833
Maybe she's innocent like you.

767
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:48,333
Maybe she's been framed. Would you
like her to live like you in shame?

768
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:54,875
Nobody else can save
her in Hong Kong.

769
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,359
Yes, these are the papers.

770
01:20:18,292 --> 01:20:19,375
Go inside.

771
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:46,292
- Yes?
- My name...

772
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:51,159
...is Anil Bhatnagar.

773
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:55,292
I'm a lawyer in Hong Kong.

774
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:57,333
Jaggu sent me.

775
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:02,250
I've studied your case.

776
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:07,542
- So what have you decided?
- I met Inspector Philip who...

777
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:12,000
You can call me anything.

778
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:19,625
He is of the opinion that
if you admit to your crime,

779
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,042
you'll be imprisoned
for a few years.

780
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:27,542
And we can appeal for mercy
and get the sentence reduced.

781
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:33,542
And if I don't plead guilty?

782
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:45,099
If the Inspector
proves in the court,

783
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:50,359
that you smuggle cocaine,

784
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:53,292
you can even be
sentenced to death.

785
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:57,167
How can I plead guilty
when I am innocent?

786
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,083
Look, my dear.

787
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:05,500
The issue is not
whether you are guilty or not.

788
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:12,708
They found cocaine in your bag.
They have a strong case.

789
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:15,559
Sir, Rahul kept the
cocaine in my bag!

790
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:18,239
I am innocent whether
you believe it or not!

791
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,699
I know that you are innocent but...

792
01:22:22,139 --> 01:22:23,399
Look, Roshni,

793
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:28,208
by your admitting it, they save
their face and you your life.

794
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:30,333
I only know this.

795
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:36,333
As your lawyer, I
advise you to admit it.

796
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:44,833
Tell me one thing, Sir,
can the truth be bargained?

797
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:50,375
Go and tell that inspector
that I am innocent.

798
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:53,792
I have done no wrong.
If he wishes he may free me.

799
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:57,333
- Or he may kill me.
- Just a minute.

800
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:02,208
That boy, what's his name?

801
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:07,292
- Rahul.
- Yes, do you have his picture?

802
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:13,667
There's a camera in my bag.
It is in that.

803
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:20,500
All right.
I'll prepare your case papers.

804
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:24,625
Even after knowing that
my case is weak,

805
01:23:27,292 --> 01:23:28,625
will you help me?

806
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:33,917
I have to support the truth.

807
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:41,583
I'd asked Jaggu to find my father.

808
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:44,083
Did he find anything?

809
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:52,375
Your father? I don't know.
I will ask him.

810
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:04,583
What happened?
Is she admitting to her crime?

811
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,875
- No.
- Why didn't you tell her?

812
01:24:09,292 --> 01:24:13,000
If she doesn't, Inspector
Philip will prove her guilty.

813
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:17,167
She can be given the death penalty!
Why is she doing this?

814
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:26,279
Why? Because she's my daughter!

815
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:27,958
My blood!

816
01:24:29,667 --> 01:24:31,875
Today she faces the same
accusation that I did years ago.

817
01:24:33,042 --> 01:24:35,019
Even I never admitted
to being guilty!

818
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:38,625
I got ruined!
Got separated from my family!

819
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:42,625
She's my blood!

820
01:24:42,917 --> 01:24:45,583
She's very stubborn.
She won't admit it!

821
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:51,542
If you're so proud of your blood
tell her you're her father.

822
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:55,458
I'm scared, that I
might lose the case.

823
01:24:55,958 --> 01:25:01,375
What will I tell her? That her dad
is so weak he couldn't save her?

824
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:05,333
She can bear the
greatest shock.

825
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:07,625
Till the day she
doesn't find her father.

826
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:12,542
But the day she finds
him, she'll break.

827
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,042
That is why I am saying.

828
01:25:17,542 --> 01:25:21,458
A lawyer can lose this
case, not a father.

829
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:35,083
Did you find anything
about that boy?

830
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:41,417
There's a camera in her bag.

831
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:44,083
It may contain his picture.

832
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:46,167
Where's her luggage?

833
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:48,917
With Philip.

834
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:54,542
We'll pay him to get
the luggage released.

835
01:25:56,542 --> 01:26:01,459
This is the rascal
who has trapped my baby.

836
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:04,792
Have courage.

837
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:39,792
You take the elevator.
I'll take the stairs.

838
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:44,750
- How are you, Mr. Chadha?
- Fine. You?

839
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:48,458
What happened of
that girl's case?

840
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,167
That case is still in progress.

841
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,625
Find him yourself if
you have his picture.

842
01:26:58,042 --> 01:27:01,833
- It's the job of the police.
- We know our job well.

843
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:03,958
Who are you to teach us?

844
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:06,667
The police will
do what it has to.

845
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,875
You do what you want to.

846
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:13,750
- Clearly tell us what you want.
- Everybody's God is the same.

847
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:16,625
- What?
- He won't listen like this.

848
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:18,833
- How much do you want?
- Very good.

849
01:27:19,042 --> 01:27:23,167
- US $50,000.
- US $50,000?

850
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:26,167
- Are you mad?
- Me and mad?

851
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:28,333
- He has gone mad!
- OK.

852
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:33,019
- Jaggu, you come with me.
- The man is crazy!

853
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:38,833
I've brought you some things.

854
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:44,458
Jam. Cheese. There's an Indian
who makes good sweets.

855
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:49,417
And some money.

856
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,958
You haven't answered my question.

857
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:54,625
Is there any hope?

858
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,333
We'll have to find some way.

859
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:03,000
Don't lose hope.
If you lose hope...

860
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:09,625
Jaggu will definitely do something
to get you out of here.

861
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:12,625
You keep this bag.

862
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:16,333
We will arrange for
more money, keep this.

863
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:27,750
So many things?

864
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:28,917
Who gave it?

865
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:31,958
Come here.

866
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:42,250
- Who gave it?
- What does it matter?

867
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:45,083
- May I eat?
- Yes.

868
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:51,542
Neil. He too must be hungry.

869
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,917
- Do you have money?
- Yes.

870
01:28:56,917 --> 01:29:01,417
Keep it in. We'll go out tonight.

871
01:29:01,917 --> 01:29:04,833
We'll give this to him.
Will you come with me?

872
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:07,292
- Who is this?
- My brother.

873
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:10,667
He too is here.
In the men's jail.

874
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:03,083
Now I'll show you
how this lock opens.

875
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,958
This is the men's hospital.

876
01:32:08,917 --> 01:32:10,708
Neil, I've brought you food.

877
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:15,708
This is Roshni.

878
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:24,208
Can't he speak?

879
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:32,000
He is dumb.
They caught him along with me.

880
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:35,833
The poor thing was innocent.

881
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:42,792
Eat all this.

882
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:00,519
Tiger! Tiger!

883
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:14,000
This is Hong Kong not Bombay.

884
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:16,708
You could lose your life.

885
01:33:19,542 --> 01:33:23,208
Life is momentary.
But we need money.

886
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:30,458
- Don't bet till I tell you to.
- OK.

887
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:37,458
Take care.

888
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:18,500
- Are you all right?
- Don't bet till I tell you to.

889
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:22,625
- He will kill you.
- Nothing will happen to me.

890
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,542
Stake all the money.

891
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:08,125
I can't. We'll organize
money from elsewhere.

892
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:11,750
- You'll die!
- No! It's my life!

893
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:15,125
- Do as I say.
- Why are you doing this?

894
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,208
Why are you endangering
your life for my daughter?

895
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,750
I'm not doing it
for your daughter.

896
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:27,542
- I'm doing it for myself,
my love. -Your love?

897
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:30,958
I love Roshni.

898
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:33,542
I came here for her.

899
01:36:34,667 --> 01:36:38,875
My love cannot lose.

900
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:43,125
Then go on.

901
01:36:46,083 --> 01:36:47,917
Pound the rascal to pieces!

902
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:49,167
I am with you.

903
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:51,542
Your love is with you.

904
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:54,750
Go Jaggu!

905
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:47,333
Thrash the scoundrel!

906
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,542
Here's the money.

907
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:34,500
She'll be released tomorrow.

908
01:39:26,042 --> 01:39:29,417
It has been proved

909
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:33,167
that the packet contained
talcum powder and not cocaine.

910
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:39,208
Hence the court frees Roshni
on bail till the next hearing.

911
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:44,250
And she is warned to be present
in the police station every week.

912
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:56,792
- How did you manage it?
- Jaggu did this, not me.

913
01:39:56,917 --> 01:39:59,708
I told you I'd do
anything for you.

914
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:01,958
I'll arrange for
your air tickets.

915
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:06,458
Meet me at the airport by evening.
Show her the city till then.

916
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,000
Come on.

917
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:23,250
Greetings to your
love, my lover.

918
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:29,292
Greetings to your
love, my lover.

919
01:40:32,417 --> 01:40:35,917
My life is dedicated
to your name.

920
01:40:36,667 --> 01:40:40,083
I am yours.

921
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:43,708
Greetings to your
love, my lover.

922
01:41:44,333 --> 01:41:45,879
Come near.

923
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:49,625
There is no distance
left between us.

924
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:52,583
Come near.

925
01:41:52,667 --> 01:41:56,479
There is no distance
left between us.

926
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,059
There is nothing left
of you nor of me.

927
01:42:05,625 --> 01:42:09,859
Let's get lost in one another.

928
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:17,125
Greetings to your
love, my lover.

929
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:31,059
I am yours

930
01:43:27,917 --> 01:43:32,125
I've become sleepless
and restless.

931
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:36,042
Love has made me blind

932
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:40,333
I've become sleepless
and restless.

933
01:43:40,417 --> 01:43:44,792
Love has made me blind.

934
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:48,167
My steps have begun to wobble.

935
01:43:52,042 --> 01:43:55,500
Greetings to your
love, my lover.

936
01:43:58,859 --> 01:44:03,279
My life is all yours, my lover.

937
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:09,139
I am yours.

938
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:51,833
The evidence that the customs
officer placed before court,

939
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:56,833
proves that Miss Roshni
bribed a customs officer.

940
01:44:57,333 --> 01:45:01,250
And had the cocaine
replaced with talcum powder.

941
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:05,708
The court holds her guilty
of drug smuggling in our country,

942
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:09,958
offering bribery and
misguiding the court.

943
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:13,250
And sentences her to death
by a firing squad.

944
01:45:17,083 --> 01:45:18,375
We will appeal.

945
01:45:19,833 --> 01:45:22,167
Your case will go to
the Supreme Court.

946
01:45:24,208 --> 01:45:25,708
And if it is not accepted?

947
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:32,167
Promise that whatever
happens to me...

948
01:45:35,417 --> 01:45:38,125
You will have Rahul punished!

949
01:45:40,333 --> 01:45:43,375
So that he does not ever play
with another innocent girl.

950
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:53,250
But nothing will happen to you.
My heart says so.

951
01:45:55,792 --> 01:45:58,875
And what does the mind say?

952
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:01,625
Do you want anything else?

953
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:08,500
Any news of my father?

954
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:12,875
I feel he still doesn't know.

955
01:46:15,042 --> 01:46:16,167
What is happening to me.

956
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:27,000
Nobody in this whole city
knows what's happening to you.

957
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:31,667
As far as your father is
concerned, forget him.

958
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:33,125
Forget him.

959
01:46:33,542 --> 01:46:37,875
Because the man who left
your mother in difficulty.

960
01:46:39,042 --> 01:46:41,208
The one who is still
running from you.

961
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:45,417
Who is afraid of the responsibility
of a father, it's best to forget him.

962
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,542
Nothing will happen to you.

963
01:49:53,458 --> 01:49:54,500
Nothing will happen to her!

964
01:49:55,292 --> 01:49:57,208
Nothing will happen to her
as long as I am alive.

965
01:49:58,292 --> 01:50:01,833
What will you do?
And what will I do?

966
01:50:03,292 --> 01:50:06,917
They will shoot her before me and I,
her father will do nothing!

967
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:08,917
Being a lawyer I won't
be able to save her!

968
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:12,500
If I can't save her,
I can help her break jail!

969
01:50:14,375 --> 01:50:17,708
- What did you say?
- If I can't help her,

970
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:19,333
I can help her break jail.

971
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,625
Don't talk like a madman!
How will she break jail?

972
01:50:23,042 --> 01:50:27,500
That I don't know
but I know I can get her out!

973
01:50:27,833 --> 01:50:28,750
But how?

974
01:50:30,792 --> 01:50:33,458
There's no jail in the world
that you can't break out of.

975
01:50:34,208 --> 01:50:36,833
There must be some way
to break out of this one too.

976
01:50:53,167 --> 01:50:55,042
Jaggu, come here.

977
01:51:01,333 --> 01:51:05,292
Read this. When Japan attacked
Hong Kong in the second world war...

978
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:08,458
Seven prisoners escaped
from the cell Roshni is in.

979
01:51:08,833 --> 01:51:13,833
It is mentioned here.
It's connected to a tunnel.

980
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:19,583
Meaning if that tunnel exists,
Roshni too can come out.

981
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:23,208
But how will you reach there?

982
01:51:44,792 --> 01:51:47,208
You guys don't know my idea.

983
01:51:47,792 --> 01:51:51,042
Let me get in.
I'll set fire to your prison.

984
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:53,292
Shut up!

985
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,292
Look at this.

986
01:51:57,417 --> 01:51:59,458
Just a minute.

987
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,917
One minute.

988
01:52:06,667 --> 01:52:08,917
Bombay jails are better.
What are you looking at?

989
01:52:10,083 --> 01:52:11,167
I'll give you a slap!

990
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,792
Look at him.

991
01:52:16,292 --> 01:52:21,000
Who asked you to spend
all the money in one day?

992
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,667
You small timers
have this problem.

993
01:52:24,167 --> 01:52:27,667
You know how to eat
but not to digest.

994
01:52:29,042 --> 01:52:31,917
Now rot in prison. Idiot!
Got me also in trouble.

995
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:34,250
I'll give you a tight slap!

996
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:37,917
I'll hit you so much
you'll turn dark!

997
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,500
Shut up!

998
01:52:41,958 --> 01:52:43,625
Jaggu has come to this jail.

999
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:48,500
He's made a map of the tunnel.
He'll bring it to you.

1000
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:54,708
I'll wait for you at
the airport tonight.

1001
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,458
I've to take your picture
in these glasses.

1002
01:53:01,542 --> 01:53:02,542
Wear the glasses quickly.

1003
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:21,083
I'll make your fake passport.

1004
01:53:22,833 --> 01:53:24,458
And I'll wait for
you at the airport.

1005
01:53:49,375 --> 01:53:51,667
Hey, rotten face!
Give me a smile.

1006
01:53:53,458 --> 01:53:54,958
Is your mother dead?

1007
01:53:55,333 --> 01:53:57,208
Is your father dead?
Why don't you smile?

1008
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:01,875
Come here. I will
show you something.

1009
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:07,292
I'll give you a guard's job
if you come to Bombay.

1010
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:12,042
Look here. Here.

1011
01:54:13,708 --> 01:54:15,250
Hail Lord Ganesh!

1012
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:12,417
Don't get up. Bye.

1013
01:59:27,292 --> 01:59:28,417
Jaggu!

1014
01:59:59,917 --> 02:00:05,125
Trust your love.

1015
02:00:06,625 --> 02:00:12,083
Trust your love.

1016
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:19,250
Just wait.

1017
02:00:20,167 --> 02:00:26,167
A little more for me.

1018
02:00:27,417 --> 02:00:30,833
So what if the world, luck.

1019
02:00:30,958 --> 02:00:34,583
And god turn against you.

1020
02:00:34,667 --> 02:00:38,125
So what if the world, luck.

1021
02:00:38,250 --> 02:00:41,542
And god turn against you.

1022
02:00:41,708 --> 02:00:44,708
My love can't bow down.

1023
02:00:45,042 --> 02:00:48,167
Except in front of
my lover's feet.

1024
02:00:48,542 --> 02:00:51,750
So what if the world, luck.

1025
02:00:52,125 --> 02:00:54,917
And god turn against you.

1026
02:00:55,583 --> 02:00:58,625
My love can't bow down.

1027
02:00:58,833 --> 02:01:02,208
Except in front of
my lover's feet.

1028
02:01:34,583 --> 02:01:38,625
You can hurt me
I don't care.

1029
02:01:39,917 --> 02:01:43,750
I have loved and not
committed a sin.

1030
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:56,042
My body is full of bruises.

1031
02:01:56,208 --> 02:01:59,583
But I didn't whimper even once.

1032
02:02:03,333 --> 02:02:06,875
Now give me another punishment.

1033
02:02:56,375 --> 02:03:00,750
Just take my name.

1034
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:06,250
And show some courage.

1035
02:03:14,333 --> 02:03:17,708
This world isn't powerful.

1036
02:03:17,792 --> 02:03:22,083
We are not weaker than the world.

1037
02:03:24,833 --> 02:03:27,875
Love is greater than this world.

1038
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:06,875
Jaggu is in the men's hospital.

1039
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:10,125
We only have tonight.

1040
02:04:12,292 --> 02:04:15,000
I've heard they'll
shoot you tomorrow.

1041
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:19,458
Do you know where
the men's hospital is?

1042
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:23,875
I know. I can reach there.

1043
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:34,458
Then you must get out tonight
under any circumstances.

1044
02:04:35,958 --> 02:04:37,375
I'll wait for you
at the airport.

1045
02:04:38,208 --> 02:04:41,292
- Good luck.
- Do you have some money?

1046
02:04:49,917 --> 02:04:51,000
Now go.

1047
02:11:17,818 --> 02:11:19,042
Get up!

1048
02:11:19,158 --> 02:11:22,938
Jaggu, get up. Get up.

1049
02:11:23,618 --> 02:11:24,618
Roshni...

1050
02:11:32,333 --> 02:11:34,708
...take this map and go.

1051
02:11:37,042 --> 02:11:40,708
- No!
- I can't come with you.

1052
02:11:43,250 --> 02:11:44,583
I'm in a bad shape.

1053
02:11:46,958 --> 02:11:49,500
- Take it.
- I won't go without you.

1054
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,042
I won't leave
without you, Jaggu!

1055
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:56,625
- Get up!
- Don't insist.

1056
02:11:56,875 --> 02:11:58,542
It's very important
for me to stay here.

1057
02:13:30,083 --> 02:13:30,917
Let's go.

1058
02:17:08,292 --> 02:17:10,583
- You go.
- No!

1059
02:17:11,458 --> 02:17:13,458
- Go on!
- No!

1060
02:21:15,292 --> 02:21:17,667
Don't worry about me.
I will make it there.

1061
02:21:18,125 --> 02:21:20,750
I'll wait for you. Come soon.

1062
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:23,875
Hurry up.

1063
02:21:25,875 --> 02:21:30,125
I'll always have the sorrow
that I didn't meet my father.

1064
02:21:33,792 --> 02:21:35,125
It's time for the
flight. Let's go.

1065
02:21:48,542 --> 02:21:49,708
Continue walking with me.

1066
02:22:27,125 --> 02:22:28,417
She came to meet me.

1067
02:22:36,333 --> 02:22:37,333
I'm her father.

1068
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:54,125
Go. Hurry up.

1069
02:23:20,458 --> 02:23:23,292
My child!

1070
02:23:25,478 --> 02:23:26,918
My child!

1071
02:23:36,708 --> 02:23:38,917
Take care of yourself.
Nothing will happen now.

1072
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:14,750
Still in the bathroom? Hurry up.

1073
02:24:16,042 --> 02:24:17,917
The flight to Bangkok
leaves in two hours.

1074
02:24:18,333 --> 02:24:21,292
- I'll be out soon, darling.
- Packed your bags?

1075
02:24:21,542 --> 02:24:23,667
Yes, it's on the table.

1076
02:24:25,708 --> 02:24:27,542
We're going to Singapore later.

1077
02:24:28,583 --> 02:24:31,250
Shop all you want there.

1078
02:24:37,833 --> 02:24:39,500
- Who is it?
- Waiter, sir.

1079
02:24:51,375 --> 02:24:53,208
Who are you? What do you want?

1080
02:25:03,417 --> 02:25:06,250
Why are you beating me?
What have I done to you?

1081
02:25:07,417 --> 02:25:08,500
Roshni.

1082
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:21,417
This is for cheating me!

1083
02:25:23,667 --> 02:25:26,208
This for the days and nights,
I spent in jail!

1084
02:25:29,083 --> 02:25:31,042
This for the tears I shed!

1085
02:25:34,708 --> 02:25:39,083
And this is for misguiding
girls like my daughter!

1086
02:25:39,708 --> 02:25:40,542
Take him away!

1087
02:25:57,292 --> 02:25:59,125
I've been waiting for you
since my childhood.

1088
02:26:01,042 --> 02:26:02,750
Don't ever leave me again!

1089
02:26:04,917 --> 02:26:07,167
I'll never leave you!

1090
02:26:09,292 --> 02:26:11,417
Found him! Found him!

1091
02:26:11,583 --> 02:26:16,042
Thank you, God!
I found my Jaggu!

1092
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:19,417
I'm running behind you
since you escaped from jail.

1093
02:26:19,542 --> 02:26:21,583
Now I've found you and I'm safe.

1094
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:22,583
Let's go.

1095
02:26:24,125 --> 02:26:27,000
How are you sister-in-law?

1096
02:26:28,375 --> 02:26:32,167
Madam, we share an old relation.

1097
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:34,958
I'll go to jail
and get him medals.

1098
02:26:35,208 --> 02:26:37,750
And beat Rahul some more.
I'll be back very soon.

1099
02:26:37,875 --> 02:26:40,708
- But Jaggu...
- It's just a matter of few years.

1100
02:26:40,875 --> 02:26:43,583
They will pass in a flash.
I'll go and be out soon.

1101
02:26:44,292 --> 02:26:45,625
Will you come to see me in jail?

1102
02:26:47,167 --> 02:26:49,738
- Yes.
- Found him!

1103
02:26:49,838 --> 02:26:52,138
- Let's go. -I'll get my
promotions this time.

1104
02:26:59,417 --> 02:27:03,792
Greetings to your
love, my lover.

1105
02:27:12,708 --> 02:27:17,042
My life is dedicated
to you name

1106
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:20,917
I am yours
