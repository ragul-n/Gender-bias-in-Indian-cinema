1
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:33,902
Sweeping, sweeping"
But still the mind is not clean yet..

2
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,893
Won the lottery?

3
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,970
Have your tickets ever won?

4
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,104
You come with your tickets
Only to fool people

5
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,445
lam going" I have work

6
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,805
Check ifl have met with any luck..

7
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,813
If only there were a 6 or a 9!

8
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,047
Sorry: these are duds..

9
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,129
Everything cleaned up?

10
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,900
Though the inside is
cleaned And the outside

11
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,668
How to clean it inside out?

12
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,676
Stop spinning yarn..

13
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,905
Now lock the shop and
hand over the key to Rashid

14
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,658
A tea for me

15
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:47,647
HORIZON

16
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,676
No chance: dude..

17
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,209
Better look for someone else
to sing, You won't get Naila

18
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,457
Her mom says she is not
sending her to school again

19
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,486
But we've the
program next week!

20
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,384
No use talking about it now

21
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,826
Now how do we
find someone to sing?

22
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:31,361
What about me?
You?!

23
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,306
Why are you upset when
you heard Naila is not there?

24
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,405
Nothing

25
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,535
Tomorrow, go and
check at her house

26
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,005
No, her father is a bully

27
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,714
Then you contact her over phone

28
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,544
No balance left.

29
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,351
Even othenuise, you have no
balance..Com e, let us go..

30
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,262
Have you got 100 rupees with you?

31
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,871
A strong cup of tea for me

32
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:17,638
You come at midnight and
leave early in the morning

33
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:26,056
Hoping for visa, how long have you
been Running after that Rashid?

34
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,158
Do you ever think of your home?

35
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,423
Ever bothered whether
there is rice or groceries?

36
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,821
Why should you...?

37
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,395
You can always get
your belly filled here, isn't it?

38
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,528
Please give her
whatever she wants"

39
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,608
Great way to start the day!

40
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,836
250 grams of sugar

41
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,370
HORIZON

42
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,531
What is it?
It is for me

43
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,705
That's why I asked

44
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,467
Ok: check for yourself

45
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,448
Don't think I can't read?
Itoo have learned English

46
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,447
Your dad knows what you are up to

47
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,948
That's why he has asked you
to stop going to school

48
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,179
But how can he alone decide that?

49
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:30,912
What?

50
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,087
That I need not study anymore

51
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,156
You studied too much,
that's your problem

52
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,884
Don't you know your dad!

53
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,929
He got to know you went
with someone on the bike

54
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,559
And nothing else?

55
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,199
Don't make me talk more..

56
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,828
What is it?

57
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,410
Look at this!
I don't understand anything of it

58
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,077
Naila

59
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,249
What is it, dad?

60
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,144
What is this?

61
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,050
It was sent by my friend

62
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,681
Look! Enough of this
mobile message business!

63
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,221
Remember: you are engaged

64
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,410
No: dad. It is about that
music program at college

65
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,432
From now on:
no college, no music, ok?

66
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,848
So they say they'll hit back

67
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,110
Let us wait and see

68
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,782
Just give me your word,
and I will take care of the rest

69
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,817
Even if it is a legal case or whatever
We will see when it comes..

70
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,308
If we can solve these
issues without much trouble.

71
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,022
Hey, who is this?

72
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,675
Now: everyone needs
the dates of Premlal

73
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,575
TV channels buy the film
only if there are super stars

74
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,573
I have already discussed the subject

75
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,247
He'll give you the date
But won't come in time..

76
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,488
Today, he was supposed to come
at 8 AM But hasn't turned up yet..

77
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,784
Sir: will you please check?

78
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,187
One minute

79
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,286
Sir: tea"

80
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,038
Where to, Vasuettan?
I will call you after I reach there

81
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,071
Come on, let us go to West Hill

82
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,932
I will call you after I reach there

83
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,412
Terribly hot..

84
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,895
Yes: it is me, Vasu
Have you packed her off?

85
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,434
She is gone. Ok

86
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:05,208
It is ok. We can manage all that

87
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:12,643
Don't worry about it
I will come and take it from there

88
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,912
Ok.

89
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,716
Hey, look ahead and drive..
Don't ram into anyone"

90
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,119
Understand?

91
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,427
This is why I told you..

92
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,190
HORIZON

93
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,949
Sir: you won't come?

94
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,253
Day after tomorrow?

95
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,754
It is the song scene that day

96
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,992
Ok: sir: lwill inform: sir..

97
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,097
Sir: He has not yet come.

98
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,174
Now you can expect him
only tomorrow or day after

99
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,429
So: I need not wait?
Yes

100
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,234
Ok: then

101
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,239
See you.
Ok

102
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:51,408
Who is it?

103
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,681
Don't you know?
No

104
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,442
He is Manoharan, film director

105
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,846
Very experienced and
knowledgeable about films

106
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,149
But not in the field now
Unlucky.

107
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,585
He started a film:
with Subhasree as heroine

108
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,622
But she died in the middle of the film

109
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:05,972
The film also came to a halt

110
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,192
If it had come out, Malayalam
cinema would have been different

111
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,132
She died more than 10 years ago"
Didn't he make any film after that?

112
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,033
He didn't want to.
He's a peculiar character

113
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,469
He will make a film
only if he has confidence

114
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,145
Now he has hit
upon some new subject

115
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,748
If it comes through: it will be good
He needs Premlal's date for that

116
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,717
If he gives a date,
it will be a super film

117
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,950
Ok: Madhu, everything ready?

118
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,494
You go ahead

119
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,792
Who is it: Vasuettan?

120
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:49,100
Hey: don't get the wrong idea
about everyone who comes with me

121
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,502
She has come to act in the film

122
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,137
So, you also supply people for films?

123
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,342
Then what?

124
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,106
So: you don't have any other stock?

125
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,646
There is enough with me.

126
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,214
Only that you can't afford them

127
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,480
Why so?

128
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,284
Look: for college girls:
it is Rs 3000 plus a churidhar

129
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,281
Can you afford that?

130
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,486
If it is a cinema or TV
serial party: the rate is still higher

131
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,526
Can you afford it?

132
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,493
So: you are really busy

133
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,027
Yes: I have no time to breathe"

134
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,498
Your phone number is the same?

135
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,268
How can I, when I've so
many customers calling me?

136
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,272
I too will call you once in a while

137
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,247
Keep this. Usually I don't pay
This is because it is you

138
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,981
Auto..

139
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:39,516
Where to?

140
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,817
Maharani Hotel Ok

141
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,831
Stop it Why?

142
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,797
I forgot my phone..

143
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:53,602
One minute"

144
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,169
Sir, Forgot your phone?

145
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,739
Thanks, what's your name?

146
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,540
Jose Kaithapuzhayil.
I had met to you once

147
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,177
lam Bhanu's assistant.

148
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,717
When is your new project?

149
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,121
Planning to start by April end

150
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,221
Sir, I would like to work with you..

151
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,355
I will call you

152
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,352
Lets go

153
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,217
HORIZON

154
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,742
Hello. Where are you?

155
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,682
I had been to a location.

156
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,818
To confirm the dates...

157
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,022
But he hasn't come..

158
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,083
Cinema is like that, you know?

159
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,095
Are you on duty tomorrow?

160
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,161
We will meet, ok?

161
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,734
Ok: we should

162
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,905
Oh: you are in films?

163
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,237
A little bit..

164
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,107
Direction?

165
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,950
Somewhat"

166
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,548
Which is your new film?

167
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,686
Isn't it enough if I
tell you when I start it?

168
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,520
There are no good
stories in Malayalam now

169
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,624
That's why all our films go bust..

170
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,695
Then why don't you write a good story
And save Malayalam cinema?

171
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:32,024
But it is not my field
Then what is your field?

172
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,864
This: the auto"

173
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,531
Then better proceed
straight through that field..

174
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,446
Do you know Babukka?

175
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,573
Which Babukka?

176
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,614
He is from my place
He has done some good songs

177
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,353
Oh, M S Baburaj?

178
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,888
He is a big man

179
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,654
Where is your home-town?

180
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,362
All places are like my home-town

181
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,189
True.

182
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,296
Any songs in your films?
Or, is it an award movie?

183
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,129
No, there are songs in it

184
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,492
There should be songs in films

185
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,607
- Othenivise, what is
a film without songs?

186
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,070
You like songs?

187
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,642
Of course..
Songs are my...

188
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:14,911
Your...'?

191
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,924
Hello: Rasheed

192
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,289
Where are you? Driving the auto?

193
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,725
Tell me

194
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,496
On your way: can you
go to that travel agency

195
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,691
- And confirm my tickets?

196
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,697
I had asked them to prepare it

197
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:42,568
Just go and collect it?
Yes. It is ready there

198
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,272
Ok: then don't worry about it

199
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,544
I want a new SIM card"

200
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,113
What? SIM card?

201
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,649
Yes. I want to
change my old number

202
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,821
You need an ID card
to get one now

203
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,321
What card?
Identity card.

204
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,686
There are many.
Which one do you want?

205
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,861
There are many.
Which one do you want?

206
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,399
Buy the best one available
Do you want to tell me which one?

207
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,709
You do what is necessary
I will pay you when I come

208
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,978
So: she doesn't
even listen to Rasheed?

209
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,657
That's my only consolation
She always listens to her dad

210
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,516
You very well know his tem per..

211
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,624
Good. The girls
nowadays are unpredictable

212
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,664
There is one there, The whole
day in front of the computer!

213
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,298
True. And we know nothing about it

214
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,735
It is not like our school days

215
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:53,777
These days: they exchange
messages over phone

216
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,067
What do they write in it?

217
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,545
It is coded. We don't
understand anything of it

218
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,680
They use a different language

219
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,882
Code? What code?

220
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,456
Hey: why are you hiding
inside when there are guests?

221
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,114
But when did you become a guest?

222
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,849
Oh: so you consider
me your relative!

223
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,517
I am haPPV

224
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,319
Want one?

225
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,530
Why do you worry unnecessarily?

226
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,794
These girls understand everything

227
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,798
I hope so..

228
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,932
Why this engagement
all of a sudden?

229
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,972
One can't trust girls these days

230
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,141
They roam around
with boys, make calls"

231
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,441
Suhara is worried.
And lam not here too

232
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,311
So we thought we
will get her married

233
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,719
Then we found Moideen' son
He is doing good business there

234
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,720
True: there is no point in
educating girls these days

235
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:51,530
How much?

236
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,067
You pay as you wish

237
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,334
Tell me how much

238
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,598
We: Kozhikodans
love footballers and artists

239
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,605
You can pay whatever you wish

240
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,812
Ok sir: I am leaving

241
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:16,318
Oh: it got through?
I had hopes. It is a great relief..

242
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,724
Do one thing. Go and
inform Avukkar also

243
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:22,994
They were close to our dad

244
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,199
Where is Naila?
She is inside

245
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,632
Tell her we have left

246
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,126
HORIZON

247
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,446
There was no need to show
your hostility with my people

248
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,447
You invite whoever you are
close to I never said no to it

249
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,229
About Jamal, I've
told you I won't call him

250
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,226
And you know the reason

251
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,595
What did he do there?
He stole the money my kids earned

252
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,227
Did I ask you to invite Jamal?

253
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,633
But you have to
invite my mother and sisters"

254
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,740
You go and do that

255
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,409
Do women go and invite
When there are men at home?

256
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,034
I never considered him a gentleman
You call him: if you want.

257
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,874
So that's what you
think about my people

258
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,742
You do whatever you want
I said I can't do it

259
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:23,918
Hey

260
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,395
Where is he: your boss?

261
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,228
How many times have Itold him

262
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,115
- Not to repair vehicles
in front of my shop?

263
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,792
Move it..

264
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,570
Then donate five
cents of land to me

265
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,174
The shop is closed: isn't it?

266
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,958
Don't worry whether
it is open or closed

267
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,341
I've given you a space on rent,
You go and work there

268
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,675
Then you better evacuate me too

269
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,748
I will. That's why
I have filed the case

270
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,819
Let the court decide it, not you

271
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,682
Please move that vehicle aside

272
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,948
Go mind your business
Can't you see me working?

273
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,718
Why don't you
work in your own place?

274
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,157
So: there is your
and our space here: eh?

275
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:01,231
You better move that vehicle
from here Othenlvise I know how to

276
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,991
I have dealt with bigger things".

277
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,431
You may be a big man in Dubai..

278
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,094
But those tricks
won't work here, ok?

279
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,830
If you don't, I will destroy it..

280
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,039
Then you will get beaten up too

281
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,305
Don't play with me
Go and mind your business

282
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,645

Isn't he inviting trouble?

By the time the vegetables reach
the market They will start rotting"

287
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,823
What to do?
It is the heavy traffic

Feeling thirsty, coming for a drink?
No: you go ahead

289

I had forgotten my bag in an auto

The driver was a
baldy with a little beard"

From where did you get it?

297
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,681
From West Hill, and
I got down in Maharani

298
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,110
If you got down at Maharani,
No use searching here

I have lost a bag in an auto"

Anyway I'll alert the

No. but there were some important papers
Should I file a complaint?

317
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:43,412
No. It will only complicate things

318
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:49,952
And you won't have
time for anything else..

319
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,390

00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,821
Isn't it out of love for you?

359
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,428
What love? Nonsense!

360
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:20,235
Where is your friend Sura?
You and your friends!

361
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,400
I asked him to be here by 7

362
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,914
Must be standing in the queue...
There is a terrible rush..

363
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,641
Go and stand in the queue

364
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,048
Sir: one minute
There is an envelope for you

365
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,188
A boy brought it

366
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,131
Boss was asking
whether you'd pay at least

367
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,736
- A part of your outstanding rent..

368
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,900
Don't worry, I will settle it next week

369
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:32,931
HORIZON

370
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,140
You are on duty?

371
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,103
If so, will you call back after duty?

372
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,481
Ok

373
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,064
You are in the room?

374
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,708
I am in the car below

375
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,410
Can you come out
if you are not too busy?

376
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,079
I can't climb up..

377
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:55,848
I just came in.
Let me change my dress

378
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,494
All the stuff you brought:
are they over?

379
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,823
Long back. Don't you remember?

380
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:14,197
Yes: I do, that was like water.
You get such stuff here too

381
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,774
You should have asked me..
I'd have brought you real stuff

382
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:18,696
HORIZON

383
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,478
Where were you?

384
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,982
Don't you know
about the queue there?

385
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,520
Ration shops are much better

386
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:05,882
That is a point

387
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,317
What is that bag with you?

388
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,890
From where did you steal it?

389
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,990
Today a film chap
got into my vehicle

390
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,995
First he lost his
mobile: but he got it back

391
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,698
Then he left this bag in my vehicle

392
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,831
These artists are like
that. absent-minded

393
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,835
But I am not absent-minded

394
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,734
When did you become an artist?

395
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,969
Leave it. Check what is inside
that bag..Maybe there is money in it..

396
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,951
Take it outside and open
Maybe it is some bomb..

397
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,111
True.. it is bombs everywhere

398
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,022
Listen: recently, in Mangalore"

399
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,524
Are you still in Mangalore?

400
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,026
I am scared. If it is money in it..

401
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,222
If it is money: he will return it

402
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,525
He is a Kozhikodan.

403
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,632
Don't you remember
last time he did the same?

404
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:54,731
Why do we need others' money?
It won't do us any good

405
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,771
Keep it there. lwill return it tomorrow

406
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,373
These are only papers.

407
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,180
This is my special setup.

408
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:14,148
I can't go to bars;and my kids
won't allow me to drink at home

409
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,853
Here: have one..

410
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:18,959
Usually: I..

411
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,225
Come on: have one
For company's sake

412
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,497
Cheers

413
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,563
When you say cheers, you
should look at the other in his eyes

414
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,231
That means I trust you

415
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,168
Cheers

416
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,751
How are things progressing?
Did you meet Premlal?

417
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,311
It seems he is not back yet

418
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,123
He became a
super star only recently

419
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:52,785
It was with my film 'Nishagandhi'
that he came to films

420
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:57,131
Now that I am broke,
he doesn't even answer my calls

421
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,001
Cinema is like that.

422
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:03,535
He had listened to my
script and agreed to do it

423
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:10,342
But the problem is with his dates

424
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,149
When someone like you
calls him for your movie

425
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:15,479
- Dates should not be a problem
He knows that too

426
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,781
I remember the
days of stars like Nazir

427
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,422
I had just finished a
disastrous production

428
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,823
At that time: there he calls:

429
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:33,535
'I came to know
about your film. Don't worry

430
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,463
Come with a good
subject, I will be with you..'

431
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,432
That is Nazir sir

432
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,176
Those were great times"

433
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,735
No, I didn't forget.
By that time, Prabhu cam e..

434
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,771
Prabhu is an old producer,
He is in a bad shape at the moment

435
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:16,973
No: no. For company's
sake: that's all

436
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,542
Rasheed: you have guests

437
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,082
Who is it?

438
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,548
Some women along with kids

439
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:37,399
Naila, please call your dad"

440
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:39,357
HORIZON

441
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,120
Mom: he has not taken his phone..

442
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,619
I don't carry my phone when I
come for programs like this

443
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,823
If I carry: I'll have to tell the truth

444
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:08,497
Now: lam relieved of that.

445
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,599
Isn't it a point?

446
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:11,723
Yes it is

447
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,731
But I never thought of it.

448
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:18,299
And she calls me every minute

449
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,465
As if I am about to run away"

450
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,737
When we have our
own private things like this"

451
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,607
Yes, that too is a point

452
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:44,226
See: I've to go to
Ernakulam tomorrow night

453
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,193
Can I meet you before that?

454
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:56,834
I may need your help.. ok?

455
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,586
How come you
are in a romantic mood?

456
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,983
Nothing" it is my friend.

457
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:14,528
Fﬂend: eh?
Now everyone is called a friend..

458
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,826
What's the point
in being a movie man?

459
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,902
This life of ours is a flash in the pan

460
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:30,470
If you die, it is ok..
But if you get sick like me..

461
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,511
That's why I
said you need some support

462
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:48,297
Hey: you are going to
have a big event in your house

463
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,133
- And you haven't
even informed us about it

464
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,360
Do we need to be formally invited?

465
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,063
A marriage in Rasheed's
house is like one at our house..

466
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,832
It is not marriage:
only an engagement

467
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,508
Bridegroom is from Muscat.

468
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,645
He will come in June And the
marriage will be conducted then

469
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,979
Is she old enough to marry?
Isn't she studying?

470
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,085
Enough of it.

471
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:17,658
Do you know how old
my wife was when I married her'?

472
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:18,924
She was 14

473
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,753
Really"

474
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,730
Yes. My daughter is 17 now.

475
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,965
See: we've to do
things at the right time

476
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,103
- Otherwise it will lead to tension
Especially if it is a girl

477
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,534
Come on: pour..
That's a point

478
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:34,142
In our community: girl has to be
at least 18 There are new laws"

479
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:39,214
To hell with laws!
I decide things at my home

480
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:42,078
As for me, once I make a decision,
I don't have second thoughts

481
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,249
Don't stand there.. come on: lock it

482
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,128
Our case is still in the court,
othenlvise: I'd have shown him...

483
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:56,093
Didn't I warn you
not to give him the shop?

484
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,798
Now you are in trouble"
What use talking about it now?

485
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,300
I know how to throw him out

486
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:07,703
Let the case take its own course
Give me a nod, and I will do the rest

487
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:11,336
Give him one
good twist at the middle

488
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:17,078
- And he will be like a
vehicle without centre bolt

489
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:20,223
Don't be rash.

490
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,046
You have to
handle these things tactfully

491
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:27,092
If Ravi interferes: he can solve it
In fact I had talked to him about it

492
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,398
But you went and filed a case"

493
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:37,039
If you sell your shop now:
you will get double the amount

494
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,102
No, I don't want to sell it

495
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:42,834
When I return here,
I've to have some business..

496
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:46,972
True.. moreover, it is in front of your
house And it is easy to manage"

497
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,209
That is a point

498
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,147
If you have such plans,
I will give you an idea

499
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,451
Beauty parlor
business is really doing well..

500
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,212
It is a good business..

501
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,392
Women today
spent a lot on makeup

502
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,756
It is only here. You come with me

503
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,592
Once you cross
the border: it is full nature

504
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,898
What?
I mean natural beauty"

505
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,766
Listen. Today, someone
like that was in my auto

506
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:13,132
She was with Vasu..
And wants to be in films..

507
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:15,835
Which Vasu?
Pimp Vasu

508
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,243
Oh: then I know what it is..
No: she is not that type..

509
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,610
I tried" but I can't afford it

510
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,842
Present rate is 3000 plus
a churidar: it seems..

511
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:28,249
3000 rupees! Get lost!

512
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:30,485
If you have any
doubt: lwill call him now

513
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:34,186
That is the rate for college girls: If it
is a film or serial: it is much more..

514
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,698
Didn't I tell you? the cost of
living in our land is very high

515
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:42,332
Even if it is 3000: it is worth it!

516
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:49,642
Dear Sura: come with me to Nagpur
There you get lots of fine girls

517
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:55,013
The other day: while I
was coming from Gundelpet

518
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,494
- There was a "bird" on the way..

519
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:00,487
Then?
Then what? Usual mischief,

520
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:05,216
we took her down the valley
and gave her Rs 50, out of love

521
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,323
Don't try to fool us, ok?
Me? Fool you?

522
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:15,466
Look here: this is Kumudam,

523
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,234
- And that is Santham ma:
she is a Malayalee

524
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:17,895
Really?

525
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,432
Yes: you come to Gundelpet
with me There are many there

526
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:24,138
You are really smart
Come with me, once..

527
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,778
Now: who is this?

528
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,541
Not from Gundelpet:
but from nearby"

529
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,783
Don't worry about the bag

530
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,062
You left it in an auto, isn't it?
You will get it

531
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:52,440
Do you remember that song from my
film, The one that never got made?

532
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,541
Yes, it is a good song.

533
00:43:55,433 --> 00:44:00,849
Tonight I write the
saddest of my poems..

534
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,748
You remember it?
Then what?

535
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:10,388
Don't mistake me. It is
also not out of desire for money

536
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,695
Can't you include
that song in your new film?

537
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:17,795
It is a good song, let people enjoy it..

538
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,401
I don't know...

539
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:21,604
Anyway, listen to that nice song"

540
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:42,675
"Tonight I can write
The saddest verse"

541
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:07,664
"The night is shattered And the
blue stars shiver in the distance"

542
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,008
HORIZON

543
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:48,541
"My sight searches for her, My heart
looks for her: she's not with me"

544
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:59,619
"The night faded away
The waves covered the moonlight"

545
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,468
" Under the boundless sky..."

546
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:14,634
- "She loved me:
sometimes I loved her too"

547
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:29,646
"So: this night,
this dark night.."

548
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:48,901
" Love is so short,
forgetting is so long"

549
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:02,715
"How deep The memories of love"

550
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:13,426
"ln the distance,
someone sings in the night"

551
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:35,545
"My soul trembles
with deepest sorrow"

552
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:41,120
"So this darkened night: this night.."

553
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:03,987
Did you get another one?

554
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,395
I have no grief about
saying no to you: sons..

555
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,965
I don't think he can manage it

556
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,162
Sura: go to Joy and get one more

557
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:15,771
But he charges too much

558
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:19,272
Don't worry about it. We'll share it..

559
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:24,403
Look, I am leaving. I have
work early in the morning

560
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:27,446
You don't have to leave
because you have to share

561
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,083
I will pay your share too

562
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,445
Hey, there is no need for any share"

563
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:35,786
No drinks for the next two days
- So, this is on me

564
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,822
You proceed then I am leaving"

565
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,759
Ravi, let me out"

566
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,660
If you want to leave, you can
Why drag Ravi too?

567
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:50,338
You are not sharing, But why
do you prevent others from it?

568
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,509
So, you are leaving
us behind like this?

569
00:48:57,068 --> 00:49:01,039
Rasheed, then why should
we stay back? Let us too leave..

570
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:02,442
Sura: let us 90..

571
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,124
Don't close the shop.
We need cigarettes

572
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,468
Sura, manage a
pint from somewhere

573
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,036
You can: if you really wish..

574
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,143
It is too late
You won't get it anywhere now

575
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:31,279
Why can't they keep
the shop open till 12?

576
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,441
Do one thing, drop us to the bar..

577
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,279
It is too costly there..
Don't bother: it is my treat today"

578
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,250
Then: come..
Hell! Here she calls again!

579
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,324
What is it? lam on my way?

580
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:55,727
Kids have slept?
Look: I will be there soon

581
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:57,065
Put the phone down

582
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:01,135
Not closed shop yet?
I have some work left..

583
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,942
Rasheed: you proceed
It was a call from my wife

584
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,709
lfl don't go now, I
will have to fight with her

585
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:16,953
You were right, with this phone
in hand: we cannot do anything

586
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,563
What if we drop it?

587
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,889
Anyway we started, let us go

588
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:31,728
HORIZON

589
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:25,588
What rush?, These people don't
have anything else to do?

590
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,031
Shall we go?

591
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:42,371
Come on, get in

592
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,912
Sura Yes

593
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,542
Were you talking about this earlier'?

594
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:52,347
What?

595
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:57,221
The one you saw in the
morning..3000 plus churidhal'?

596
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,391
Is that the one?

597
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:04,363
No, it is not her
Come on, let us go

598
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:26,617
Hey, stop

599
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,052
What?

600
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:39,724
Why don't you go and give it a try?

601
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:43,071
It is not the case
I talked to you about

602
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:45,668
She is from some good family"

603
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,140
So what? Are we
too not from good family?

604
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,140
Go and have a look

605
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,682
Are you serious?

606
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,820
It is fun: isn't it?
Give it a try

607
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:06,082
HORIZON

608
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:41,255
Where to?

609
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,131
Coming?

610
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:53,835
How many are there?
Only one

611
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,037
For you?

612
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,142
No, not for me

613
00:53:57,301 --> 00:54:01,306
Why? Can't you handle me?
Not that. I've no need for it

614
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,582
It is for him

615
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,916
After getting there, if you say
there are more: I will get mad

616
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:15,287
No, there is only one
What about the money?

617
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:19,396
How much will you pay?
At this time, 500 will do

618
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,134
- Othenlvise, it is 1000

619
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,701
After getting there, if
you can reduce it a bit..

620
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,360
What?

621
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,333
No, I will bring the auto

622
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,339
Coming?
Get lost

623
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:50,197
You are from the Gulf? Nice smell
- Unbearably hot!

624
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:53,831
I was in Ooty, and
it is very cold there

625
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:02,403
Hey: drive carefully.

626
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,772
Where are you going?

627
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:10,710
Hope it is not a long one?

628
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:28,368
Sir, got a room?
No, it is full

629
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,797
Please check Sorry, no rooms..

630
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,572
No rooms! And they call it a hotel!

631
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:41,848
No room there

632
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:10,334
So you have no
experience getting rooms?

633
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:13,038
Go to Hotel Krishnagiri

634
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:14,875
They charge only
Rs 200 for an hour

635
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:20,884
Don't get tense..We will find a way

636
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:23,680
HORIZON

637
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:25,951
Pull it down..

638
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:30,584
No, this won't work,
You said only one person

639
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:32,625
No, I am leaving now

640
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:35,491
If you leave, how will I go?

641
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,188
By that time, I will be back"

642
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:38,799
Ok: then you do one thing

643
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:42,961
When you come, buy some
parathas for me From Durbar Hotel

644
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:44,367
Do you want? No? Ok

645
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:46,269
Get me two chilly chicken too

646
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:49,572
I haven't had
anything since morning"

647
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,474
So, this is the
room you were talking about

648
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:55,383
What kind of a setup is this?

649
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,914
What if we send her back?
Don't worry..

650
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,984
No: this won't work, send her back

651
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:10,528
What are you saying?
She had another booking

652
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,156
I brought her because
you asked me to

653
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,635
Now if we say no:
she will create a ruckus

654
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,838
You somehow manage her till 12

655
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,642
By then, I will be here with the food

656
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:23,073
Take this" Sura..

657
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:41,126
If the room were a little bigger,

658
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:43,164
- I could have hung
these clothes to dry..

659
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:53,931
Is Maniettan here?

660
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,409
You promised to come:
and you are here?

661
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:00,641
What if I am not there?

662
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,805
All the rest of our
gang were there, isn't it?

663
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:05,019
Was 'share' Sasi there?

664
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,176
The moment we
mentioned about sharing, He left

665
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,417
All these government
employees are like that

666
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:11,584
He does it all the time
Want to have a drink?

667
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:26,701
What are you doing
after bringing me here?

668
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,437
Checking whether
neighbors are asleep?

669
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,712
This is the problem
with places like this

670
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:37,382
There won't be peace of mind

671
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:42,214
Your phone..

672
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,123
What is it?

673
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:54,030
But I am in Mysore now: in Taj Hotel

674
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,961
How are you?

675
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,803
But there are others here..

676
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:03,242
Hey: open the door
Open up

677
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,740
I will call you later

678
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,383
You wretch: open the door

679
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:15,348
When the family head arrives home,
you dare to keep the door closed?

680
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,193
When I come home, She closes
the door and talks over the phone

681
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:31,338
You are a real wretch!
I will show you..

682
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,837
I was waiting for your call

683
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:36,575
Why don't you pick
the phone when I call?

684
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,443
Do I owe you anything?
Then what did you tell Vanaja?

685
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,944
Don't talk to me like that, ok?

686
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:44,584
I too have enough
experience in this field

687
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,449
And it is hard
earned money: mind you

688
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,750
Not like yours: you son of a bitch!

689
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,760
Switch off that phone!

690
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:53,087
What? I can't let
my customers down

691
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,394
So you have everything here

692
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,034
Would you like to have one?

693
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,962
Have one: it will perk you up..

694
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,799
Why are you so dull?

695
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,073
Have a little. No
'touchings' to go with this?

696
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,036
What a strange place?

697
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:17,612
Now: let me tell you
something Business is business

698
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:22,319
Not that I don't trust you, Didn't
that boy tell you about the money?

699
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,131
I liked you the moment I saw you

700
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,791
Your look: posture"

701
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,767
One doesn't feel
the same with everyone

702
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:38,266
You really look smart

703
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,706
I won't give back
anything from this, ok?

704
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,104
You are again
climbing on top of that?

705
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:48,944
Look: I have to leave by 12.30

706
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,679
Will you keep quiet?

707
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:03,395
Mony: lam leaving"
I am coming too..

708
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,828
You have to pack up all these"

709
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:07,357
I have something urgent to do

710
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:08,595
What urgent work?

711
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:10,900
Ok, you leave then

712
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:13,830
HORIZON

713
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:08,218
Didn't I ask you to have a swig?
It would really perk you up

714
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:13,495
Did you bring me here
to waste time sitting like this?

715
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:49,095
Parcel ten parathas and a beef fry

716
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,397
Sir, you forgot your bag in my auto

717
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:21,727
Hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere?

718
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,011
Now where is my bag?
I saw it when I returned the auto

719
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,301
I didn't have your address.

720
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:26,430
Come on, give it back now

721
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,872
But it is not with me now.
I kept it somewhere else..

722
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,705
Then, let us go and take it

723
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,847
Don't worry. It won't get lost

724
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:37,382
Didn't I tell you'd get your
bag today or tomorrow?

725
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:42,579
So: for the joy of getting it back,

726
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:44,487
Have one more..

727
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,092
You too: have one..
No: I don't want.

728
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:58,103
There is checking on the road
Have it: man: just for pleasure.

729
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:04,642
Tomorrow you can say
You shared a drink with a great artist

730
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:13,409
HORIZON

731
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:34,408
What? What is it?

732
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:41,480
Something ran past What?

733
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,552
Maybe a snake

734
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:48,080
Ora rat. Such a grand place this is!

735
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:56,895
There..

736
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,173
It is there"

737
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:21,120
You are unnecessarily
getting worried

738
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:22,582
You and your rat!

739
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:27,721
What kind of a man are you?
Getting scared of a rat!

740
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,831
But one won't
believe it if one looks at you

741
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,659
What kind of a setup is this?

742
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,767
It is ok: when the boy
comes with food, call me

743
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,666
I am going to sleep

744
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:51,644
You too can come and lie here
Later: don't say it was a loss

745
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,626
Ok: Prabhu sir:
we will meet tomorrow

746
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:08,197
Sir: there is a small problem..

747
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:08,664
What?

748
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,772
I can't take you to the
place where I kept the bag

749
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,835
You stay in my auto:
I will bring the bag

750
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:13,429
That's ok

751
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:27,918
What are you up to?

752
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:34,092
Somebody is waiting for me there
It is 1.30 AM now.

753
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:38,690
The boy hasn't yet
come with the food

754
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:43,631
He promised to come by 12
Did he meet with an accident?

755
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,438
Look: I have to go

756
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:47,371
Ok: then you get lost

757
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:51,240
How do I go without opening this?
You do all these and"

758
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,505
Will you please keep quiet?

759
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:56,243
If I keep quiet, will you open it?
You call someone and open it

760
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,510
He will come.

761
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:03,004
You will lose only that
party's payment: isn't it?

762
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:06,721
Do you think it is a small amount?

763
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:11,899
I will pay that, ok?
Will you? Then it is ok.

764
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:14,497
Anyway I will inform the party

765
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,735
We have to be
professional: you know

766
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,605
He is a good customer

767
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,467
Lower your voice..

768
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,470
Is this ok?

769
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:36,489
I don't think I will finish duty today
It is overtime today

770
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:42,186
I will call you tomorrow: ok?

771
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:54,505
That boy negotiated to
reduce it to 300 I will take all this.

772
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:02,541
You forget your duty
and waste time like this

773
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:07,852
Tomorrow don't blame me for this

774
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:13,649
HORIZON

775
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:43,415
Why don't you stop,
when the police signals?

776
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:47,895
Hey: can't you hear me?
I didn't notice it: sir

777
01:09:48,151 --> 01:09:48,925
Blow

778
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,724
I came to buy food, sir Somebody
is urgently waiting for me..

779
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:58,629
Stop talking and blow..
I didn't notice, sir..

780
01:09:58,795 --> 01:09:59,967
Come on, blow..

781
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:12,485
Sir, it is positive
Come on: get down

782
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:16,618
Take the documents of the vehicle

783
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:20,652
I have something
urgent to attend to: sir

784
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:27,528
Look: we draw good salary now
You keep this with you..

785
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,263
Come with us

786
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:35,074
Sir: you catch another auto
This won't go today

787
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:38,239
If you release him now,
I can use the same auto

788
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,310
He is drunk.

789
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,005
Drunken driving is
not allowed: you know that?

790
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:44,242
In which case, I too am drunk
I will travel only in this auto

791
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:46,285
Oh, you will travel in this auto only?!

792
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:50,018
Sir, he says he will
travel only in this auto

793
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:52,126
Ask him to get down
and take another auto

794
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:55,997
Sir, it was I who
prompted him to drink

795
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,490
So, you can charge me for abetment

796
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:02,398
There is no provision
to charge the passengers

797
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:03,999
Why is it like that?

798
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:09,610
But you do charge innocent people
for abetment in murder cases.

799
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,540
If you want to get him discharged:

800
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,272
Come to Kasba
police station tomorrow

801
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:15,940
Kasba!

802
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,476
Take another vehicle

803
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:21,281
How can I?
We haven't come to a decision yet

804
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:27,021
Who are you to decide? Lawyer?
My father was a lawyer

805
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,025
He is not a lawyer, but a filmmaker

806
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:29,938
Both are the same.

807
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:31,866
If you are so particular,
get into the jeep

808
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,457
Take both of them

809
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:42,668
Don't worry, Kasba sub
inspector is my man, I will manage it

810
01:11:45,368 --> 01:11:51,216
Move, make space
for everyone Move..

812
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:15,861
You two go and sit there

813
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:18,028
What nonsense is this?

814
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:23,844
A police station that doesn't have
the Commissioner's phone number!

815
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:31,652
Listen: do you know who
Palathingal Varghese is?

816
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:35,255
No, who is it?

817
01:13:35,345 --> 01:13:36,323
It is me.

818
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,660
If I call, the Commissioner will
rush hereAnd then your cap will..

819
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,330
Hey: keep it there

820
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:49,668
Look: then leave the
commissioner alone

821
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,703
Let us call the Inspector General

822
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,103
Where do I sit? Here...?

823
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:04,574
Ask there

824
01:14:10,513 --> 01:14:17,727
I am friend of SI Subashchandran
What is this? Is today Friends Day?

825
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:21,127
LG's friend: Commissioner's friend
Now here comes Sl's friend

826
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:22,734
They too were saying this

827
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:26,939
lam not getting him on mobile
Please give me his land number

828
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,643
We have no provision
to give it to you

829
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:32,975
After duty: he switches off his mobile

830
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:36,548
Don't the police have to be
on duty round the clock?

831
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:41,280
So: the police don't
have to eat and sleep, is it?

832
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:44,789
He is of a peculiar type. You can
come and meet him in the morning

833
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:45,687
Now, you can go

834
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,335
Sir, can you get me out of here?

835
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:59,997
No chance: you'll have
to wait till morning

836
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,724
Sir: I have to take
this food to someone

837
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:04,435
No one will die if
they don't take food once

838
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,874
In Somalia, people live
without food for months

839
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,881
Don't say that, sir
I have to go

840
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:12,618
You sit here. Let me try again

841
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,333
How much?
65 rupees

842
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,784
Turning police station into a garden?

843
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:55,018
No, I was passing
through the college street

844
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:56,232
- and I found someone there

845
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:58,899
He says he was planting trees
That too, at midnight!

846
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,227
Where is he?

847
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:02,427
Come on in

848
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,070
This is the man

849
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:11,710
This is our Shobindran master

850
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:14,348
What were you
doing there at midnight?

851
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:15,038
Give him a chair

852
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:18,243
It is monsoon, and it is planting time

853
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:21,820
So I was planting
saplings with students

854
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:26,118
By evening, they all went home

855
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:31,455
But as we had already dug the pits
I thought I will finish planting them

856
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:33,190
Otherwise: someone may fall into
those pits Then came your men

857
01:16:33,356 --> 01:16:34,061
Greetings: sir

858
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:35,495
Hello

859
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,700
There are people who dig pits

860
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:41,206
- Not to plant trees
But fall into it later"

861
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:44,378
You have shooting work here?

862
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,446
I may have to shoot,
if things proceed like this

863
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:47,745

What do you do now?

Rasheed: I was caught while I
was returning I had had a drink

01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,884
Now I am at the station
I don't think I will be out today

Hey: what are you doing there?
Trying to break the lock?

You won't even
allow people to sleep

876
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:07,615
That boy will come
and open in the morning: man..

877
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:59,534
Hey: move aside"
You: son of a bitch!

878
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:22,797
I never thought you
were that sort of a guy

879
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:24,006
You also don't look like one

880
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:26,600
It was a mistake on my part

881
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,635
Not one mistake, but two

882
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:33,704
First: you locked them from outside
That is ok, we can always open it

883
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,436
But secondly, you
informed home about it

884
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:41,439
I think you have
done all this deliberately

885
01:20:41,604 --> 01:20:42,742
No: I am not that sort of a person

886
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:45,113
Then what sort of
a person are you: sir?

HORIZON

888
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:13,507
Will it happen like that?
Now what shall I do?

889
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:14,797
What to do?

890
01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:20,711
Any idea to escape from here?
Idea from me?

891
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:28,622
If you have any trustworthy
friend, call and tell him

892
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:30,690
Ask them to go and open the shutter

893
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:40,724
I have no such friends, sir

894
01:22:41,357 --> 01:22:44,338
You don't even have a good friend?

895
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,598
Joseph, please hurry up
People are waiting for the vehicle

896
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:24,005
Look: you didn't damage your
vehicle after asking me

897
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,703
I have to take my tools"

899
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:22,334
Here is the tea Keep it there

900
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:41,910
Sir. tea
Give them"

901
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:53,530
An unidentified body in the bypass

902
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:57,465
This newspaper
guys are wandering all night

903
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:58,264
- In search of dead bodies!

904
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,302
To give trouble to the police!

905
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:00,496
Sir: I am going"

906
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:05,874
Don't worry, that news
was printed yesterday night

907
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:11,250
Your news must be on TV nowYou
will get to see it: when you get out

908
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:18,751
Have it

909
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:30,368
I have to take kids to the school
The parents are calling me

910
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:34,037
What do I do, sir?
What to do?

911
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:35,949
The kids have to go
to school isn't it?

912
01:25:35,998 --> 01:25:38,171
Call one of your friends to arrange it

913
01:25:42,204 --> 01:25:44,184
Hello: sister

914
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:45,683
Suran? Where are you?

915
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:48,017
My auto is under repair

916
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:48,815
You won't come?

917
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:52,185
Don't worry, Sudhi's auto will come
Please wait for 10 minutes

918
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:01,828
Where are you?

919
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:03,493
I am here No work today?

920
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,134
There is.
No one has called yet

921
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:06,863
Can you do my trip to the school?

922
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:09,966
What happened to you?
My auto got stuck

923
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:14,314
When will Subashchandran come?

924
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:17,350
It is duty first for him
He will be here exactly at 9.30

925
01:26:17,706 --> 01:26:19,708
That is, if he doesn't
go for acting in some cinema

HORIZON

927
01:26:59,782 --> 01:27:01,591
Whom are you looking at?

928
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,230
You started it the
moment we came here

929
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:07,589
There is no water here
even to wash one's face

930
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,897
Any chance of getting a tea?
Will you shut up?

931
01:27:15,097 --> 01:27:19,307
Why should I?
Look if you love me, I am really good

932
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:21,195
But if you quarrel with
me, I create a ruckus

933
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:24,650
I don't want to quarrel with you

934
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:29,481
Because you give
me money whenever I ask

935
01:27:30,312 --> 01:27:32,485
Even if I ask now, you will: isn't it?

936
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,630
I literally invited them to lock me up
I thought you would be there

937
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:45,566
But when I went, you were not there

938
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:49,105
The clerk told me
about your peculiar ways"

939
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,839
You switch off the
phone after duty time, is it?

940
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:54,139
You know what?

941
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:58,206
Two months back,
in Alleppey, I told a joke

942
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:03,014
- When that central
minister was passing through

943
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:08,819
I said, I can go to sleep only
after this son of a bitch passes by

944
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:11,761
Some journalist heard that

945
01:28:12,087 --> 01:28:15,398
Then comes the suspension:
and punishment transfer

946
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:22,140
After that, duty is duty:
And after duty, no duty

947
01:28:22,264 --> 01:28:23,299
That's nice

948
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,706
What happened to that bag?
Got it back?

949
01:28:30,005 --> 01:28:32,007
I got it

950
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:34,486
Didn't I tell you?

951
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:36,987
Most of the auto drivers in
Kozhikode are gentlemen

952
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:47,157
When is the new project?
In planning stage now

953
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:51,893
The old style is passe in Malayalam

954
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,234
Some new youngsters
have entered the scene

955
01:28:54,396 --> 01:28:55,841
They are really smart"

956
01:28:56,598 --> 01:29:01,069
But that is ok,
a strong subject is what you need

957
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,844
Sir, you know it
inside this khaki uniform is a...

958
01:29:04,973 --> 01:29:07,214
I know: the artistic
mind within the uniform

959
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:13,187
Yes.. I had got a
chance in Ranjit sir's last film

960
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:15,626
But there was no dialogue

961
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:24,093
I got a dialogue in Siby sir's film,
"Don't shatter that magic mirror"

962
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,896
But there was no punch in it

963
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,072
If there is no punch:
the dialogue is of no use

964
01:29:30,232 --> 01:29:34,180
True: dialogue needs punch
Is your script work over?

965
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:37,583
Do you do the writing?
No: the script is by him

966
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:42,516
Really?
But he doesn't look like it

967
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:47,516
Sir: please consider my case too
A dialogue with punch

968
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:51,925
I am good at acting

969
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:05,169
Here they go early in the morning?

970
01:30:05,334 --> 01:30:06,574
Don't they have any other work?

971
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:20,790
Look how happy he is!?
No thirst, no hunger"

972
01:30:32,394 --> 01:30:33,668
Don't forget the
dialogue with punch, sir

973
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:35,315
- Script-sir, don't forget my dialogue

974
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:40,370
Sir, don't forget my role, I will call you
Sure..

976
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:40,072
Stop it..
What are you doing?

977
01:31:40,896 --> 01:31:44,708
Don't call anyone
Then what? I have to go

978
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,335
Are you planning to kill me?

979
01:31:57,045 --> 01:31:59,821
Who is it?
Mind you job

980
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:06,230
Go straight from here,

981
01:32:06,421 --> 01:32:07,832
Don't make noise..

982
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:12,534
Go straight from here, turn left
And then straight.

983
01:32:14,997 --> 01:32:21,243
What are you doing? Why don't
you let me talk to someone?

984
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:24,945
Oh, he is gone"?

985
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:36,786
I will kill this boy today

986
01:32:37,019 --> 01:32:41,229
Hey, get lost..
All the time, messing with that horn

987
01:32:45,427 --> 01:32:47,031
You go and get me my bag

988
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:53,337
Sir: I am getting scared

989
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:58,278
Why should you get scared?
You have the key with you.

990
01:32:58,707 --> 01:33:02,018
Go: open it and let them out
And get me my bag

991
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:06,989
But: sir..

992
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:08,428
The other shops will be open now

993
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,253
So how do I raise the
shutter and bring them out?

994
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:12,821
What about my bag?

995
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:17,063
I need it to do my other things

996
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:18,529
You better hurry up..

997
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:19,798
You too come with me..

998
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:22,004
Me? For what?

999
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:24,141
You go and come
I will wait here

1000
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:25,470
I am scared to go alone: sir

1001
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:27,273
Any idea"?

1002
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:32,951
Do one thing. Don't go in your auto

1003
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:40,386
Go by bus, and then observe
the surroundings and come here

1004
01:33:42,918 --> 01:33:49,130
Or else: you cover
your head with this towel

1005
01:33:50,859 --> 01:33:55,365
In films: that's what we do to hide..
How is it?

1006
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:43,782
What do you intend to do?

1007
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,120
To die of hunger?

1008
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:53,465
I don't know I know what to do

1009
01:34:53,822 --> 01:34:56,098
What are you doing? Are you mad?

1010
01:34:56,224 --> 01:34:58,898

It is not blood, it is paint. See?

1014
01:37:02,117 --> 01:37:03,425
People are mad

1015

You go and mind yourjob..

1016
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:16,735
Vasu: what is this?

1017
01:37:16,931 --> 01:37:17,705
I don't know

1018
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:21,074
Didn't you close the paint can?
Yes, I did

1019
01:37:21,302 --> 01:37:23,145
Who is on top floor?

Look into that room through
the backside window

1023
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:36,089
See what is happening inside

1024
01:37:36,217 --> 01:37:38,925
Check whether the
paint cans are upturned

1025
01:38:28,536 --> 01:38:32,143
The paint cans are lying upturned
Maybe some cat has done it..

1026
01:38:32,307 --> 01:38:34,810
Ok: then go and do your work
Ok

1027
01:38:39,381 --> 01:38:41,827
Vasu, go and get the key

1028
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:45,487
Let us clean it up

Did you really see it?

1034
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:03,304
Yes. I looked only once
Was there someone you know?

1035
01:40:03,431 --> 01:40:04,967
Yes Police?

1036
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,618
It is from Rasheed's house

1037
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:29,300
Don't pick it now
We will call back later

1038
01:40:47,475 --> 01:40:48,419
Try the other one

1039
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,026
Is it the key to the shop?
This is not working

1040
01:40:54,249 --> 01:40:56,092
Try the other one, the big one..

1041

These are not the right keys..

1042
01:41:00,254 --> 01:41:01,597
Vasu: give it a try..

1043
01:41:02,657 --> 01:41:04,261
Not working, is it?

1044
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:09,141
Shall I give it a try with my spanner?
Any lock will come off with this

1051
01:43:58,132 --> 01:43:59,372
Please, don't make any trouble.

1052
01:44:07,808 --> 01:44:09,845
In which case: should we call?

1053
01:44:10,011 --> 01:44:12,491
I don't know..
Do whatever is necessary

1054
01:44:13,514 --> 01:44:16,222
I don't see any other way

1055
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:39,211
So: that is your house.
You could've told me earlier

1056
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:44,886
Your wife is quiet nice
Why do you go for all this?

1057
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:47,517
You have two children:

1058
01:44:48,049 --> 01:44:50,129
You were talking about
the marriage of the elder one?

1059
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:52,959
She is studying, isn't it?
Let her study: man..

1060
01:44:53,388 --> 01:44:55,732
Shouldn't kids study
when they ought to?

1061
01:44:55,857 --> 01:44:57,427
Look at me for instance

1062
01:44:57,725 --> 01:45:01,901
I failed at the school exam twice,
And they married me off

1063
01:45:02,096 --> 01:45:03,769
Soon I met with this fate

1064
01:45:04,032 --> 01:45:06,171
Othenlvise I would have
at least become a doctor

1065
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:11,939
Isn't there any one to
help you out from here?

1066
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:18,351
You have no one...?
Do you want me to call Vanaja?

1067
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,721
She will do anything for me

1068
01:45:21,849 --> 01:45:23,590
No, it won't work

1069
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:25,888
I have someone else..

1070
01:45:26,254 --> 01:45:31,260
There is nothing between us
But how can I call him here now?

1071
01:45:32,927 --> 01:45:35,498
No: he will come.

1072
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:38,574
He must be waiting
for the shops to close

1073
01:45:47,408 --> 01:45:51,982
All this was unnecessary
I got drunk and got into all this mess

1074
01:45:53,948 --> 01:45:57,191
There was a woman
with your friend Rasheed

1075
01:45:57,518 --> 01:45:58,792
What happened to her?

1076
01:45:59,253 --> 01:46:00,459
She too is a human being..

1077
01:46:03,391 --> 01:46:07,601
Men always find a way out,
Do you know anything about her?

1078
01:46:08,629 --> 01:46:09,573
Who is she?

1079
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:13,136
I don't know.
We met at the bus stand yesterday

1080
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:17,277
I will check with Vasuettan

1081
01:46:17,805 --> 01:46:21,116
So, there are more characters
in the storyWho is Vasu?

1082
01:46:21,309 --> 01:46:22,185
Pimp Vasu

1083
01:46:22,443 --> 01:46:24,684
Whoever it is, call
and check about her

1084
01:46:44,598 --> 01:46:45,474
What is it?

1085
01:46:45,633 --> 01:46:49,342
Awell built, middle-
aged woman with long hair

1086
01:46:49,537 --> 01:46:50,537
She is good looking too..

1087
01:46:50,638 --> 01:46:51,446
Do you know her?

1088
01:46:51,639 --> 01:46:54,586
Who is that? Someone in
our city whom I don't know?

1089
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:56,346
She is usually found
near the bus stand"

1090
01:46:56,477 --> 01:46:59,151
But you didn't book her through me

1091
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:04,286
From what you say,
she must be third rate

1092
01:47:04,519 --> 01:47:10,026
If it is urgent, check with
Usman That is his area

1093
01:47:10,358 --> 01:47:12,838
Can you check and let me know?
Ok.

1094
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:14,062
Ok, thanks

1095
01:47:18,065 --> 01:47:19,738
He says he doesn't
know anything about her

1096
01:47:19,834 --> 01:47:21,541
Then you go and get my bag

1097
01:47:27,975 --> 01:47:29,249
Hello: when did you reach?

1098
01:47:30,111 --> 01:47:33,217
We will meet at Maharani:
I will come there

1099
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:35,586
No, I am free..

1100
01:47:36,517 --> 01:47:39,327
Even othenuiseﬂothing is
more important than the film..

1101
01:48:11,652 --> 01:48:13,723
Has Prabhu sir given
his vehicle key here?

1102
01:48:13,888 --> 01:48:14,662
Yes

1103
01:48:17,358 --> 01:48:17,995
Ok

1104
01:48:19,694 --> 01:48:20,194
HORIZON

1105
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:09,268
Climax is good: but what about
the cost of shooting in the city?

1106
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:14,120
The crowd: the problems
of controlling them"

1107
01:49:14,315 --> 01:49:16,625
I can't compromise on that.

1108
01:49:17,618 --> 01:49:20,827
All the major events in
my story occur in the city

1109
01:49:21,088 --> 01:49:23,534
And the characters are
the common people of this city

1110
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:26,370
Their tears, sweat: helplessness".

1111
01:49:26,493 --> 01:49:30,566
If you have shoot all that in depth
It has to shot among them

1112
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:35,939
If it is done in a studio set:
It won't be the film I have in mind

1113
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:42,578
Ok, I agree with that But you
have to confirm Premlal's date

1114
01:49:42,944 --> 01:49:46,482
It will be confirmed
in one or two days

1115
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:49,421
In which case, we will do this film..

1116
01:49:56,891 --> 01:49:58,871
Did Sura come here?

1117
01:49:59,126 --> 01:50:00,730
He didn't come
home yesterday night

1118
01:50:01,195 --> 01:50:02,640
If you meet him: tell him that

1119
01:50:02,796 --> 01:50:06,676
- His mother and sisters
are dead and buried

1120
01:50:07,367 --> 01:50:12,407
Didn't you know? Yesterday,
he got a bag from his auto

1121
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,380
Really?

1122
01:50:13,507 --> 01:50:14,850
I heard it was full of money

1123
01:50:14,976 --> 01:50:19,550
God! He'd have gone
to the police to give it

1124
01:50:20,214 --> 01:50:23,855
Even if his mother
and sisters are starving"

1125
01:50:24,051 --> 01:50:26,156
He only needs to see
his photo in the newspapers

1126
01:50:28,088 --> 01:50:31,661
I hope that scoundrel
didn't return the money

1127

HORIZON

1128
01:51:51,105 --> 01:51:52,413
Drop me here

1129
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,381
Our 'point' Sasi is coming

1130
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:57,113
Today he has come by bike
He saved the bus fare

1131
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:03,487
No programs today?
Shop is closed today

1132
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,425
Didn't Rasheed say, no
programs for a couple of days?

1133
01:52:05,619 --> 01:52:06,962
These Gulf people are like that!

1134
01:52:07,288 --> 01:52:10,497
When they come they bring some
bottle After that, they disappear

1135
01:52:10,658 --> 01:52:12,797
Where is that boy?

1136
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,940
Rasheed has tempted
him with visa, isn't it?

1137
01:52:15,062 --> 01:52:18,339
- So: he must be
running after Rasheed

1138
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:20,242
Maybe he will get him..

1139
01:52:21,201 --> 01:52:24,842
No chance. You
don't know these Gulf guys

1140
01:52:25,038 --> 01:52:29,282
I too was invited to
Gulf.. to that desert.

1141
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:31,712
I didn't go as I didn't want
to do scavenging work

1142
01:52:31,845 --> 01:52:33,085
Look for someone else for that!

1143
01:52:33,247 --> 01:52:35,625
So what? You can
make good money!

1144
01:52:36,016 --> 01:52:38,428
Nonsense! Do you
think all this money

1145
01:52:38,552 --> 01:52:39,587
- Is earned through honest labour?

1146
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:42,926
He is not even educated

1147
01:52:43,624 --> 01:52:46,935
I heard he made all this money
by cheating an Arab

1148
01:52:47,828 --> 01:52:49,466
Why talk about
things you don't know?

1149
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:51,436
His brother in law told me all this

1150
01:52:52,933 --> 01:52:55,607
You know one more thing?
Who was his dad?

1151
01:52:55,869 --> 01:52:57,473
Fish vendor Mam mad ..

1152
01:52:57,738 --> 01:53:04,713
One who used to
sell fish on the streets

1153
01:53:04,845 --> 01:53:06,916
He became a Dubai man only now!

1154
01:53:07,148 --> 01:53:11,028
Friends should be like this! You
are actually good at something else!

1155
01:53:21,929 --> 01:53:24,773
Somebody musfve
given it to you for free!

1156
01:53:26,033 --> 01:53:31,210
Is Rasheed at home? Shall I go
and collect the key to the shop?

1157
01:53:31,338 --> 01:53:33,579
You arrange other things
I will go and check at his house

HORIZON

1159
01:55:18,412 --> 01:55:19,516
Why are you standing here?

1160
01:55:20,447 --> 01:55:23,690
Lot of things happened
at your place today

1161
01:55:24,118 --> 01:55:27,395
Your auto is not yet repaired?
It is in the workshop

1162
01:55:27,655 --> 01:55:31,467
I did your return trip from the
school And took those kids home

1163
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:33,226
You have to take out
your auto: isn't it?

1164
01:55:34,161 --> 01:55:34,832
But: I..

1165
01:55:34,961 --> 01:55:40,206
I am going that way: come with me

1166
01:55:40,901 --> 01:55:43,245
Your gang was waiting for you

1167
01:55:44,004 --> 01:55:46,280
I think they were
carrying a bottle with them

1168
01:56:30,483 --> 01:56:34,226
Are you crying? Poor guy!

1169
01:56:37,124 --> 01:56:44,099
This is life. Things don't
happen the way we want.

1170
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:50,473
Come, let find a
way out of this place"

What a fool you are!

01:58:35,308 --> 01:58:37,345
What a fool you are!

1174
01:58:37,777 --> 01:58:40,485
People don't know about it
The police haven't caught them

1175
01:58:41,048 --> 01:58:43,654
Then what should you do? You
should get them out at the earliest

1176
01:58:47,987 --> 01:58:50,991
Other shops won't be closed yet
Then how can I get them out?

1177
01:58:51,358 --> 01:58:53,429
Now it is 10.30 PM..

1178
01:58:53,861 --> 01:58:55,169
What about Pazhani's shop?

1179
01:58:55,629 --> 01:58:59,270
He must have gone home by now
You better rush..

1180
01:59:10,243 --> 01:59:13,690
Look: I don't want any of
these things I am not of that type"

1181
01:59:14,214 --> 01:59:16,888
Unearned money
won't do you any good

Now collect your things
Let us get out

How can you go home in this dress?

1186
02:00:01,061 --> 02:00:08,240
I had bought a shirt from
Mysore I bought it for someone

1187
02:00:08,835 --> 02:00:14,649
You take it...
I don't know whether it will suit you".

1188
02:00:22,616 --> 02:00:24,289
I didn't ask your name

1189
02:00:24,851 --> 02:00:28,526
That is not very important
We adopt a new name every day

1190
02:00:29,489 --> 02:00:32,265
If you want, call me Thankam

1191
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:36,840
Isn't my heart too
'thankam' (golden)?

1193
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,030
She left?

Where did you go after opening it?

1195
02:01:10,797 --> 02:01:13,539
I was about to ask you that? Who
opened it at this time of the night?

1196
02:01:15,302 --> 02:01:16,474
You didn't open it?!

1197
02:01:16,636 --> 02:01:18,411
No, it was not me!

1198
02:01:21,942 --> 02:01:22,818
Then, who was it?

1199
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:26,586
The other key is at your house..

1201
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:36,495
Yesterday night, police
caught me For drunken driving

1202
02:01:37,357 --> 02:01:39,098
I was arrested and
I telephoned your house

1203
02:01:39,226 --> 02:01:42,400
To inform about it

1204
02:01:44,364 --> 02:01:47,106

You were here?

02:02:42,522 --> 02:02:44,900
Yesterday night:
something funny happened

1209
02:02:45,024 --> 02:02:46,594
My friend from Manjeri..

1210
02:02:56,336 --> 02:03:01,183
Suhara, open the door..

1211
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:16,226
Now: you don't say anything!
You advise everyone and now...

1212

I hate you..
Why do you live like this?

Don't worry".

What shall I do now?

1217
02:04:09,976 --> 02:04:16,416
Shall I tell you something?
I know someone: he is a big man

1218
02:04:17,617 --> 02:04:20,530
He will find some way out of this

1219
02:04:23,056 --> 02:04:27,937
What if we go and meet him?
Wear that shirt and come with me..

1220
02:04:46,045 --> 02:04:47,820
Here is your bag"

1221
02:04:49,249 --> 02:04:51,855
Are you convinced now that
auto men in Kozhikode don't cheat?

1222
02:04:53,586 --> 02:04:56,897
There is a small problem..
What problem?

1223
02:04:57,624 --> 02:04:59,365
Rasheed is standing outside

1224
02:05:11,471 --> 02:05:14,975
He is the man, is it?
Why did you drag him here?

1225
02:05:15,308 --> 02:05:19,188
We don't know who picked the
phone at home So, he is tensed

1226
02:05:19,579 --> 02:05:21,081
Sir, you have any idea?

1227
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:22,987
What is this? Am I
an idea-trader or what?

1228
02:05:23,884 --> 02:05:25,693
Take him and go back

1229
02:05:26,953 --> 02:05:28,057
But, sir..

1230
02:05:28,388 --> 02:05:30,629
Anyway, he has to go to his house

1231
02:05:31,391 --> 02:05:34,497
Only if he faces such conflicts:
will he learn about life

1232
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:37,765
I have other things to attend to: ok?

1233
02:05:41,768 --> 02:05:47,275
We will meet again
But not with confusions like this

1234
02:05:49,542 --> 02:05:50,042
HORIZON

1235
02:06:26,146 --> 02:06:28,387
Go and have bath
lwill serve dinner

1236
02:06:35,622 --> 02:06:38,660
What kind of shirt is it:
with flowers and all?

1237
02:06:38,992 --> 02:06:39,732
New one, is it?

1238
02:06:41,394 --> 02:06:42,873
You are still awake?

1239
02:06:43,062 --> 02:06:45,064
I am going to sleep

1240
02:06:45,998 --> 02:06:46,498
HORIZON

1241
02:07:25,271 --> 02:07:26,682
It is a call for me: dad"

1242
02:07:35,849 --> 02:07:37,123
Thank you so much..

1243
02:07:47,126 --> 02:07:50,403
You don't have to know all that
Just listen to what I say, ok?

1244
02:07:53,833 --> 02:07:57,178
No, this will do for the moment If I
need any other help: I will call you

1245
02:08:17,523 --> 02:08:22,063
I haven't told anyone about it
I know my dad too well

1246
02:08:23,396 --> 02:08:29,540
You are a good man
But you have some useless friends

1247
02:08:30,136 --> 02:08:35,415
It is not friendship, dad
Look at me: I have many friends

1248
02:08:35,708 --> 02:08:37,187
lfl ask them to do
anything, they'll do it

1249
02:08:37,344 --> 02:08:38,914
Without asking a question

1250
02:08:39,245 --> 02:08:40,765
Dad, shouldn't
friendship be like that?

1251
02:08:43,916 --> 02:08:49,229
Don't worry. This is not love
Who will love class mates?

1252
02:08:49,723 --> 02:08:52,033
Who will marry class
mates even if they love?

1253
02:08:52,192 --> 02:08:54,468
Same class room: same teachers"

1254
02:08:54,727 --> 02:08:57,833
Same jokes, and
moreover, same friends..

1255
02:08:57,997 --> 02:09:00,477
Repeating the same
things throughout life..

1256
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:02,136
It will be boring"

1257
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:08,576
I want to study, dad
All my friends are going to study

1258
02:09:08,942 --> 02:09:13,482
Then: why should I be alone...?
I want to study: dad"

1259
02:09:53,486 --> 02:09:55,606
You could have at least informed me
If you were going"

1260
02:09:55,755 --> 02:09:59,965
True, you didn't take my mobileBut
you could have called our land line..

1261
02:10:02,895 --> 02:10:05,842
I didn't mention about
Jamal to make you angry

1262
02:10:05,998 --> 02:10:08,672
But when we are
inviting all our relatives...

1263
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:09,803
I understand"

1264
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:16,786
I was thinking, Why not we
postpone her engagement?

1265
02:10:16,876 --> 02:10:18,446
Why this sudden change of mind?

1266
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:25,095
What she is telling is also true
Let her finish her studies first..

1267
02:10:25,285 --> 02:10:29,131
Now how will we convince
the family of the groom?

1268
02:10:29,388 --> 02:10:32,267
Don't worry about that
I will manage all that

1269
02:10:32,558 --> 02:10:33,559
You come and sleep

1270
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:35,327
HORIZON

1271
02:11:38,557 --> 02:11:43,870
Hey: a stock has just arrivedJust
like the one you were talking about!

1272
02:11:44,029 --> 02:11:45,633
Don't unnecessarily make me mad

1273
02:11:45,765 --> 02:11:49,804
Have you gone mad?
Didn't you ask for one?

1274
02:11:49,969 --> 02:11:51,573
Can't you do some
decent job to live?

1275
02:11:51,804 --> 02:11:54,751
Not allowing people
to live peacefully"

1276
02:11:57,877 --> 02:12:00,585
Look, you will never do well..

1277
02:12:13,326 --> 02:12:13,826
HORIZON

1278
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:50,702
I am late?
It is ok. I camejust now..

1279
02:12:50,897 --> 02:12:54,743
I lost the bag with the script When I
got the bag, the script was missing

1280
02:12:57,336 --> 02:13:02,911
Here is the money you asked for
This.. it is already...

1281
02:13:03,109 --> 02:13:04,816
We will settle all that later..

1282
02:13:04,944 --> 02:13:06,480
First, go and make the film..

1283
02:13:10,650 --> 02:13:15,030
I got a story yesterday,
it is really good

1284
02:13:15,221 --> 02:13:16,101
Why don't you read it?

1285
02:13:24,297 --> 02:13:29,940
I forgot onethingl had
bought a shirt from Mysore for you

1286
02:13:30,136 --> 02:13:30,876
Then?

1287
02:13:31,070 --> 02:13:33,550
I had to give it to someone else..

1288
02:13:33,939 --> 02:13:38,979
It was not out of love..
A shirt with red flowers in it?

1289
02:13:45,751 --> 02:13:53,751
True. But I only gave the shirt:
not the flowers.You know that

1290
02:13:56,595 --> 02:13:58,006
Ok: then: I am leaving"

1291
02:13:58,163 --> 02:14:00,973
Please read it.. it
will make a good film..

1292
02:14:01,133 --> 02:14:04,580
Now, I have a new film in mind..

1293
02:14:06,372 --> 02:14:07,442
SHUTTER..
