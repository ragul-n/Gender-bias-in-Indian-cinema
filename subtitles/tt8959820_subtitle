00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:15,158
Wait and see!

187
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,604
Game Kaali!

188
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:25,198
It was a long time ago.

189
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:26,329
That's why he looks very ..

190
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,509
Comfortable BH apartment!

191
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:29,374
Welcome..

192
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,099
- What noise?
- Oh, that?

193
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:33,633
I told you? That's a monkey.
Terror Boys Group.

194
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,053
They have begun to bully.

195
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:35,919
- Chittu!
- Yes.

196
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,054
You clean this place.

197
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:39,940
I want to go see monkeys
that you say that.

198
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,326
Do you want me to clean this house?

199
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,635
I told you
who I am a supervisor?

200
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:46,637
- I will come back.
- All right.

201
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:48,613
And when I pat on the table
one more time...?

202
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,296
It will not dust again.

203
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:51,388
Right?

204
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:53,955
Snake!
- Snake?

205
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,577
The guys are brave!

206
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:22,928
Who is he?

207
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:38,899
Open your shirt. Take it off!
Take off clothes. Take it off!

208
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,721
- Open your pants too!
- Release me!

209
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:44,899
- Open your pants too! Now!
- Release me!

210
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,563
- Release me, please!
- Listen! Open fast!

211
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:54,824
You do not want to hear me say yes?

212
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,436
Welcome 'slave'!

213
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:25,496
Who is the servant to whom?

214
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,301
Hey! boy!

215
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:30,663
One step forward,
I'll take off your shirt too!

216
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,371
I swear it!

217
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:36,082
I'll make you run
Get out inside it!

218
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:37,988
When dignity is plagued,
You will not get it back!

219
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:40,691
Good kid!

220
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:44,543
From now on,
I'm the dormitory warden of you all.

221
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:48,192
Until now, whoever
make naughty and how to ..

222
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,066
I do not care.

223
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:54,245
But from now on,
no one can do anything!

224
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,024
Listen!
First year hostel.

225
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,137
Second year hostel.

226
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:58,168
Third year hostel.

227
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,597
Gather separately and stand up!

228
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:02,355
I said, make it right now!

229
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:09,664
You guys!

230
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,237
Why do you let others
Take off the shirt to the underwear?

231
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:17,156
So you're the "Terror Boys" right?

232
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,812
You must all have a home
in the city right?

233
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:22,375
From now on, you're not
can enter the hostel.

234
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,093
Goodbye
and go from here!

235
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,108
Hello!

236
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:26,483
Who are you?

237
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:27,874
Why are we listening to you?

238
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:30,077
Nobody can block it
we go in here!

239
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:31,648
Because this is our fortress!

240
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:33,680
I can!

241
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:36,147
From now on, this is my area!

242
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:37,695
Boy..

243
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,579
Are you the gang leader, boy?

244
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:42,340
You do not know you talking
with whom.

245
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,347
I'll make sure you can ..

246
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,115
You are very good at threatening!

247
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:48,385
Hey! go!

248
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:50,561
Back!

249
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:53,195
Go.

250
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:19,332
Culture bullying, hitting
and drove new students ..

251
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,346
.. started here right?

252
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:26,853
This earth is not one person alone!

253
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:31,524
Now..

254
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:34,463
After this, nobody
which can bully others.

255
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:38,472
This hostel will work
as a good hostel.

256
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:41,334
And you have to keep the behavior
such as good student behavior!

257
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:43,147
Right?
- Right sir.

258
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:46,695
And if you go beyond the limits,
I'm going to beat you.

259
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,938
Right?
- Right sir.

260
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:49,838
Good.

261
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:50,977
Now, senior.

262
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:53,876
We want to see you welcome
new students with love and affection!

263
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:47,500
Mak! Hurry up!

264
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:53,106
4 lakhs in Perumal accounts.

265
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,848
And we still lack 8 lakhs!

266
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:55,751
Yes sir.

267
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:57,215
What's this?

268
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:58,672
Hey! What happen?

269
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,755
Brother ..

270
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,072
He will not listen
if you just speak.

271
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,177
I give you a meal
so that you can talk right?

272
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,469
Dungu! Stupid!

273
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:07,824
Go at him and
Take money back, dumb!

274
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:11,510
Every day I feel like to die when
I'm trying to get my money back!

275
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:13,755
Why are you still here !?
Go!

276
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:14,995
Go!

277
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,571
Look at her and her hair!

278
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:21,041
Sir, please wait a minute.
- Sir, take your time.

279
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:22,613
How are you?
Okay no?

280
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:25,152
My account is a college account.
Everything is smooth.

281
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:27,916
Listen. I just remembered
about new college warden.

282
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:30,583
The new warden is looking
talk to Mike.

283
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,782
Ask him what happened?

284
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,571
My dear baby ..!

285
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,089
We just run the business
which runs smoothly.

286
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:39,585
Includes a dining hall contract
as well as your college bus contract.

287
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:40,982
It's your last year.

288
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:43,104
You got humble
and get your degree.

289
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,937
Dad can not go and
It's fun to be sorry with Principals.

290
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,417
Dad!
He who started it!

291
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:50,106
Why did not you tell her?

292
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,882
You can be a graduate of a degree
first in our family.

293
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:54,676
You have to meet hope
your grandfather.

294
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:56,184
We'll see.

295
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,093
Michael, do not you ride the car?

296
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:01,690
First year students until today.

297
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,370
Let me go find
mother-in-law

298
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,354
That's good!

299
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,418
Female students of the year
first St. Wood down!

300
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,386
Very excited. Yes.

301
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:41,706
She's beautiful right?
- He looks amazing, man!

302
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:43,618
Created for one
the other.

303
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:16,747
Thank you.

304
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:20,312
Hey! boys!

305
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:24,413
Do not take more idli
from what you need.

306
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,689
Because ..

307
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:28,843
Every idle you eat
after you feel full ..

308
00:22:29,153 --> 00:22:30,034
.. is the food of others.

309
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:33,560
Do you understand?
This is a memory for ..

310
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:35,682
Who is that?

311
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,885
It seems, my brain was injured.

312
00:22:49,562 --> 00:22:50,639
Mr. Chittu.

313
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:51,595
What food is it?

314
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:52,610
Idli.

315
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,852
- Hey! Looks like.
- Looks like idli.

316
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,711
You all eat this every day?
- Yes sir.

317
00:22:57,783 --> 00:22:59,745
Today is delicious
because you are here.

318
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,150
You can only learn if
You can eat well.

319
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:05,345
You've got so much money.
Why not give a good meal?

320
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,989
If you want a good meal ..

321
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:09,874
... everyone should get back to
home and eat mother's food.

322
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:12,648
This is a cooking contract.
That's how it feels!

323
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,498
Talk is fun.
Try cooking for 200 people.

324
00:23:16,314 --> 00:23:18,147
Let me see. Let me see.

325
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,179
You guys!
Go to class!

326
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:22,618
There will be a banquet
waiting for you all.

327
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:36,527
My eyes!

328
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:38,702
- Hey!
- Yes.

329
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:41,000
When you cook,
do it with love.

330
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,383
That's part of the taste.

331
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,835
Even when cutting onions
You have to enjoy it.

332
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,087
- With love.
- love?

333
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,694
I am happy
welcome you ..

334
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,052
..to College of Arts and Sciences,
Saint Woods.

335
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:56,790
- Abang ..
- Yes?

336
00:23:56,878 --> 00:23:58,219
No need.
Do not do it.

337
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:00,425
You do not have to
with love.

338
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:02,471
The journey is unique and different.

339
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,049
Who is that?

340
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:13,796
She's my girlfriend!

341
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:24,121
Kaali!

342
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,999
You're too good!

343
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:31,394
Anu. Who ..!

344
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:34,720
I said yes?
Everything is here!

345
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:37,635
What do you do, make it
with the heart! With love.

346
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,512
I was there too.

347
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,973
How about with a hug?
- Hey! No, man!

348
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:42,409
Please.

349
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:04,189
- Delightful meal!
- Delightful meal!

350
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:07,747
- Who gave us a banquet?
- Who gave us a banquet?

351
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:11,442
- Our Master!
- Our Master!

352
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:15,872
- Let's give her salute!
- Let's give her salute!

353
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:20,278
Salam Thalaivaa !!

354
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:26,280
You guys.

355
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,724
Food is
basic needs.

356
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:29,345
You deserve a question if
it's not good!

357
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:31,220
Otherwise, we ourselves
to change it.

358
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,952
If you know how bad it is,
why still need to survive?

359
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:34,812
Abang!

360
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:37,054
Where are we?
cook like this every day?

361
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:38,242
Is not the cost high?

362
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:39,448
Chittu!

363
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:43,394
I spend less than 45 rupees instead
what the contractor charges you.

364
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:44,019
Okay?

365
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,035
You guys.

366
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:48,092
Write and sign a letter
saying the food here is very bad!

367
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:51,348
We will remove the contractor
this and replace it with the better.

368
00:25:51,348 --> 00:25:52,435
Okay sir.

369
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:56,108
This is a canteen and board contractor
eating is the same contractor.

370
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:58,936
When food here is not good
You will buy canteen food.

371
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:00,408
This is their idea.

372
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:01,711
We will change it.

373
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:03,639
One by one,
we will change it.

374
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:06,942
They touch our food!

375
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:08,937
We will not let it
they miss!

376
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,841
- Do not get mad!!
- Hey!

377
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:14,111
Just gotta say good stuff!

378
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:15,987
They have canceled the contract.

379
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:18,766
They are not loyal either
with our idle.

380
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:22,651
Who is he?
- His name is Kaali.

381
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:24,351
The other I do not know.

382
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:25,591
Did I tell my dad?

383
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,236
He dumped me from the hostel
on the first day he worked.

384
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:36,125
The principal also mentioned that
he does not seem like an ordinary person.

385
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,319
He was involved in a quarrel
with you.

386
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:41,154
Close board contract
eat our dorm.

387
00:26:41,755 --> 00:26:43,087
Something is not right.

388
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:47,398
There was an old problem
not so fast?

389
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:51,410
Go check her out.

390
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:52,015
Yes sir.

391
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,606
Mike!
Where is he now?

392
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:02,780
Abang.

393
00:27:12,337 --> 00:27:13,245
Stop.

394
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:17,662
He has a strange sitting style!

395
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,311
Abang. Let me go at him ..
- Mike

396
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:22,897
I've been a thief.

397
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:24,740
I can only know
by looking at someone.

398
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:26,017
Whether he is violent
or not!

399
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,930
He does not look like that
normal man.

400
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:33,680
Watch it!

401
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:34,769
Mike!

402
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:37,167
Looks not her right hand?
There are numbered tattoos!

403
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,221
So what?
- For emergency purposes ..

404
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:42,448
Every offender in prison
will be treated with tattoos.

405
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:44,260
He must have been in jail.
- Brother!

406
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:46,136
Do not say good-bye!
- We swear!

407
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,159
I'm sure he was once
involved with violence.

408
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:50,112
Why do not we test him?

409
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,018
People like us ..

410
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:54,082
.. always be careful.

411
00:27:54,114 --> 00:27:56,590
They will know there is
people watching them.

412
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,902
I'm sure ..

413
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,333
.. he knows who we are
is watching him.

414
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:02,805
Soon she will
look at us.

415
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:18,384
Mike! turn on the car!

416
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:20,321
- Let's go!
- He's definitely not an ordinary man.

417
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:21,656
Why? Are you afraid?

418
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:24,278
Not afraid. Just be careful!
You will not understand!

419
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,331
We will be asked!
Your father told us to look at it.

420
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,129
Let's go!

421
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:41,554
I want to see you too.
But you can not.

422
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:43,046
I do not care.

423
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,551
I want to see you.

424
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:46,067
I can not go anywhere.

425
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,320
My mom will kill me.
- So let me come.

426
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,557
You want to come?
What are you talking about?

427
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:53,192
Yes, I came.
I'm out of your window.

428
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:54,729
Are you serious?

429
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:58,966
Yes its me.
- Oops! Really?

430
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,039
Open the window!
Did not you hear me?

431
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,720
- Come fast.
- Hey! Where are you?

432
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:05,603
He's on the other window!
- Yes.

433
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:08,126
Hey! That's my mother's bedroom window!

434
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:09,417
What? Your mom?

435
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:15,110
Oh god!
- Let's go!

436
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:18,383
Mr. Kaali, I have doubts.
I mean ..

437
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:21,043
Ask it!

438
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,971
When you want to do it
your destination here

439
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:25,527
Do not look like that.

440
00:29:25,552 --> 00:29:28,156
You act like you
come to education.

441
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:31,164
You must do something!
Who is it? What? When?

442
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,961
- Let me know.
- The kid who's scared!

443
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:35,092
Okay. Tell me!

444
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:38,780
What happen?

445
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:47,820
Where's the occupant of the room?

446
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:49,292
Do not know, sir!

447
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,859
- Hey, come on!
- Yes sir.

448
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:52,132
Where are the boys?

449
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:53,649
- Sir, we do not know.
- Where are they?

450
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:55,070
They said that
watch movie.

451
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:56,128
Hold it.

452
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:57,580
Let's go.

453
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:01,995
Why are you angry? They are
going back from watching the movie.

454
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:05,555
Where are they going to the stage?
- Sir! Stage?

455
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:06,727
Ganapathy movie theater.

456
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:09,097
We are in trouble.

457
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:15,718
Sir, we went to the movie.

458
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:16,841
It's late, sir.

459
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:19,669
This is my last warning.

460
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:22,841
If you do it again,
It's bad for me to do it later.

461
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:23,952
I'm fine.

462
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:26,407
But not really good!

463
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:27,881
Go!

464
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,718
Sign in! People are studying at the hostel
but go see the movie again!

465
00:30:34,107 --> 00:30:35,136
Why is that?

466
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,680
Slipping and my feet to test.
During the movie.

467
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:44,229
Anwar! Where do you fall?
It's swelling!

468
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:46,964
Hey! Why is it so swollen?

469
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:49,200
Just a small wound!
- Looks like you?

470
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:52,424
Go!

471
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,002
The road is fine. Come on!

472
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,041
Everyone! Step into!

473
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:01,659
Mr. Kaali!

474
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,696
We've deceived you.

475
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:06,214
We did not go to the movie.
Sorry.

476
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:08,682
It's ok. Go.

477
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:13,290
Can you help me

478
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:14,845
What?

479
00:31:15,316 --> 00:31:16,729
There was a problem with my lover.

480
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,892
Can you help me

481
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,658
What are you saying?

482
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,907
Nothing.
There was only a problem with my sweetheart.

483
00:31:26,907 --> 00:31:28,276
Can you help me

484
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:41,690
Yes can!
Yes I can please!

485
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,324
He could come from
Australia. For me.

486
00:31:51,324 --> 00:31:53,975
It's been six months since
the last time we met.

487
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,535
That's why he's so excited
come and do things at home!

488
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,139
I said to do it
complaint about him in college.

489
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:00,203
He's innocent, uncle!

490
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,869
So you came here for
to fuck? Not to learn?

491
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:05,869
Yes sir.

492
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:07,910
How long does this relationship last?

493
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,967
From grade 6 again.
True love.

494
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:12,050
We study together in Australia.

495
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:15,160
Oh, as early as that?
You both are great.

496
00:32:15,494 --> 00:32:18,452
Why not tell mum and dad
and do they understand?

497
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,147
Mak and dad get married on the basis of love.

498
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:23,157
But 5 years ago,
father left the mother.

499
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
Before that it was quite different.

500
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:28,256
But after that, I did not
believe in love and marriage!

501
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:32,328
I have told him another marriage,
but he does not want to.

502
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:34,244
I beg
I do not want to make love ..

503
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,077
Listen.

504
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:36,912
He told me to help the problem
her love.

505
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:38,412
I remember I got it
hit someone.

506
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:40,896
But you're talking about
things that I just did not understand.

507
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:42,301
What do you want me to do?

508
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:45,703
Go to my room. Pujuklah
he and tell all this is normal.

509
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:49,994
Tell him we're still sane.
And nothing will happen.

510
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,076
How can I find him?

511
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:54,618
My mom is Pranik Nurse.
She opened the clinic at home.

512
00:32:54,704 --> 00:32:57,744
Speak that you're headache,
leg pain. Go see him

513
00:32:57,744 --> 00:33:00,327
He will set 3 appointments.
Pujuklah then.

514
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:01,531
Your mom is a doctor?

515
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:04,244
Pranik Nurses.
- Pranik Nurses.

516
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,084
Okay. What else am I
can do? It's my fate. Go.

517
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:08,642
Go Romeo! Have fun.

518
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:09,978
Thank you uncle.

519
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,612
Thank you Mr. Kaali.

520
00:33:12,906 --> 00:33:13,906
Aunt?

521
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,648
You still have a bit?
You have no family?

522
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:18,579
I'm single. Why?

523
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Okay. Okay.

524
00:33:19,812 --> 00:33:22,108
You look still
young and stylish!

525
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:23,409
So?

526
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:26,452
Exercise. My mother
very beautiful.

527
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:27,946
Noticed!

528
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:29,327
Go! Go. Go!

529
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:32,994
Finally I'm free.
Try to trap me!

530
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,042
Who are you?

531
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:36,582
Mangalam.

532
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,197
Mangalam!

533
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,776
Good name.

534
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,202
Mangalam.

535
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:43,202
Young and stylish yes?

536
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,202
Who is it?

537
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:00,869
Hello!

538
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:03,883
Mangalam?

539
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,202
Yes. You?

540
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:07,706
Supplier?

541
00:34:08,762 --> 00:34:09,907
Pranic Nurses!

542
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:11,621
Sorry. Sorry ..

543
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:12,411
Yes. That's it.

544
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,721
I have a headache, pain
legs. Stress and stress.

545
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,520
I was told who you are
can cure it.

546
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,994
- Are you a patient?
- Hello ...

547
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:21,727
I'm not sick.

548
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:23,641
Only my beard
just gray.

549
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:25,413
Strong guy, ma'am.

550
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:26,940
That is not what I meant.

551
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:29,244
What I meant,
people who are headache.

552
00:34:29,388 --> 00:34:31,421
Can wait in the clinic.
I will go there.

553
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,619
Okay.

554
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,994
Come and stand here.

555
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:47,048
- Stand up here!
- Yes, ma'am!

556
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:53,285
Stand up straight.

557
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,410
Open your sunglasses.

558
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:08,426
If you feel uncomfortable,
You can close your eyes.

559
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,262
No. No. It is
peachy.

560
00:35:10,303 --> 00:35:11,303
Okay.

561
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,327
- It's ok. You close your eyes.
- Okay.

562
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,496
<i> Doctor! Doctor! </ I>

563
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:23,660
Oops!

564
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,186
I think .. I'm sorry.
I think that's my patient.

565
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:30,439
Give me 2 minutes. 2 minutes!
- Yes. All right. Please.

566
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:32,026
Sorry. Sorry.
I will come back.

567
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:35,135
Oh, Mr. Cheenu. Are you?
What happen?

568
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,997
You say everything
will be healed.

569
00:35:36,997 --> 00:35:39,285
But I'm sick all night.
Return my money!

570
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:41,285
I have another patient.
- Who else is that?

571
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:43,495
<i> So you got a candle!
And turn the story around? </ I>

572
00:35:43,495 --> 00:35:47,119
<i> Mr.! nothing is effective
here. I'm suffering from a knee pain! </ I>

573
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:50,174
Please do not get me wrong.

574
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,293
Forget him. She's mad!

575
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,660
First, we need to believe it
which we have healed.

576
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,827
- Right.
- Then we'll get better.

577
00:35:56,827 --> 00:35:58,192
Everything is here!

578
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:00,613
Let's go.

579
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:02,285
We continue our treatment.

580
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,910
I feel my headache is gone.
Like that too my legs hurt.

581
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,927
I have not taken care of my feet yet.

582
00:36:09,512 --> 00:36:12,294
Why? You're scared to hear
what did he say

583
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,660
Fear? No. No.
 Not like that.

584
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,827
 I'm really healed.

585
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:19,827
This treatment is effective for Aura.
It is based on the energy field.

586
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:21,890
You can read someone only
by looking at it.

587
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,578
Can I tell you about it?

588
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:25,702
There is a big secret embedded
within you.

589
00:36:25,702 --> 00:36:29,660
Sadness. Violence.
Revenge and more.

590
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,910
Do not you wear a mask
to hide all that?

591
00:36:33,577 --> 00:36:36,202
What is this? You can
make it so memorable!

592
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,202
Do you know astrology?

593
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:40,869
This is healing.
Instead of astrology.

594
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,869
But I came not for
healed. Listen.

595
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,869
He's a good boy.

596
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,535
And your daughter
very good!

597
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:47,455
They are aware of what they want.

598
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,995
No bad thing will happen.
I will handle them.

599
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:50,660
I am a college dormitory warden.

600
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:52,910
You are the mediator
for their love yes?

601
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:54,535
- Please go!
- No, no.

602
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:57,370
I'm not a middle man. I am
headache, leg and stress.

603
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,830
But it's all right?
Go. Please go out.

604
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:03,029
Listen to me.

605
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,370
Do not remember everything here.
Everything is here.

606
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,535
We can not get angry
and fear in others.

607
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:09,870
He should not give
impact on their lives.

608
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,705
- Okay. Please go.
- All right.

609
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:15,705
I know you're very wrong.
Let me give you a solution.

610
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:19,370
When I was young, there was a priest
who are in charge of our village.

611
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,370
He always said something.

612
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,035
Whenever you are mistaken,
dismiss it all for 30 seconds.

613
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,535
And dance according to
your favorite song.

614
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,073
And after that
You feel clear!

615
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,607
- Please try. Maybe it works.
- Okay. Go.

616
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:31,593
Okay. Go!

617
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:34,597
Ah! Cheenu!

618
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:35,927
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

619
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:38,222
Within 5 minutes.
All my pain is gone.

620
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,262
Believe him.
Great doctor!

621
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:47,597
Mr Cheenu. Five minutes?
Just 5 minutes. Please.

622
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:59,218
Great!

623
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:03,968
Bye!

624
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,304
I will wait
5 minutes left.

625
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:11,410
He did not say anything.

626
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:14,586
He just smiled and said,
"You know what to do"

627
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,469
That's good!

628
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:18,969
After yesterday's incident, I remember
it's the finish for your love story.

629
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:20,264
I was surprised myself.

630
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:23,415
And in the middle man
which gives the idea of ​​healing ..

631
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:26,264
..he told you to tell me
which is effective and thank you.

632
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:28,429
It works?

633
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,764
Listen. You say that you
there is a problem. Now it's over.

634
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:41,927
You came here to study.
Focus on learning.

635
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:44,562
Do not crawl around college
and cause problems.

636
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:45,456
This is not my job.

637
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:46,593
- Okay uncle.
- Go

638
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:47,386
Okay sir.

639
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:50,243
We will remember our uncle's services.
- Listen.

640
00:39:50,243 --> 00:39:51,718
Henceforward,
do not call me aunt!

641
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,317
So what to call?

642
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:55,181
Do not call your uncle.
Looks like it's not right.

643
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:32,223
Your family?
Wife? Son?

644
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,639
You never
telling them about them.

645
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,725
I've been there all this time.
But now no more.

646
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,850
Please do not ask again.

647
00:41:40,984 --> 00:41:43,640
I'm slowly trying
forget about it.

648
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:46,390
Life should go on, right?

649
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,007
That's right.

650
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,093
Life goes on.

651
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:02,996
Mr. Kaali, who's calling?

652
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:04,251
Your mother-in-law. Go!

653
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:28,920
Why, Mr. Kaali?

654
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:31,313
Looks like no headache anymore.

655
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,761
Snake! Snake!

656
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,846
Always messing around!

657
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:42,512
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

658
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:44,076
Okay, listen.

659
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:47,295
Save the love story on whatsapp,
Facebook and go back safely.

660
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,306
Do you understand?

661
00:43:48,373 --> 00:43:51,096
Do not meet alone
in the college campus.

662
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:52,136
Why are you here?

663
00:43:52,384 --> 00:43:54,043
I also studied in this college,

664
00:43:54,043 --> 00:43:55,740
I say based on experience.
So hear it.

665
00:43:58,496 --> 00:44:01,596
- What?
- Hey! What are you doing?

666
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:11,681
What?

667
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:24,846
Lovers.
Lovers..

668
00:44:25,908 --> 00:44:27,928
Sit down lovers.
Let's go.

669
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,468
Sit down.

670
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:31,137
So.

671
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:33,052
Do you both love it?

672
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,512
Yes or no?

673
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,595
Yes.

674
00:44:36,595 --> 00:44:40,593
So, we are two of you.
Today is a good day.

675
00:44:40,857 --> 00:44:43,888
Do not wait. Today
Valentine's Day.

676
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:46,389
- Brother, not ...
- Shut up!

677
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,337
Not what to do.

678
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,946
Thali tie.

679
00:44:49,946 --> 00:44:53,514
And the march around
college on this donkey.

680
00:44:53,514 --> 00:44:54,161
That's all.

681
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:55,302
Michael!

682
00:44:55,302 --> 00:44:57,597
Welcome Professor!

683
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,512
This young man will get married
on Valentines day.

684
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:02,353
I hope all this
will not happen.

685
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:05,580
You know, my life
destroyed after this incident.

686
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,766
Please do not do this.

687
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:07,891
Please.

688
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:11,039
Look at the way you appeal.

689
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:15,967
I used to be my junior.
Now, my professor.

690
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:18,469
Sir! Sir.

691
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,215
Go away.
Go!

692
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:22,714
Go!

693
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:25,237
Whether you're married
with him.

694
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:26,469
Otherwise..

695
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:30,071
..you admit that he is
just your little sister.

696
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:31,773
Brother, please release us.

697
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:33,800
- Please let us go.
- Do not disturb them, Michael!

698
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,071
Mr. Professor.

699
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:38,749
Give them a lecture
and the right advice!

700
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:41,010
Sir. Ask them to let us go.
Help me sir

701
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:43,051
Anwar, do whatever
which he instructed.

702
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:44,563
Sir, how are you?

703
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,301
When he made it to me first ..

704
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:48,774
..am fight with
unreasoned move.

705
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:50,808
He makes sure everyone knows.

706
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,496
And I lost
my lover, Anwar.

707
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,133
There is no other way.

708
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:04,633
Hey Friend! Today we have a slot

We're asking for a couple

..they choose to confess
who are their brothers and sisters!

00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,318
Surely many will hit <i> 'like'! </ I>

716
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:21,224
Cakaplah!

717
00:46:21,224 --> 00:46:24,029
- This girl, she ..
- Just speak, stupid!

718
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:27,019
Why with him?

719
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:29,110
He did not say anything.

720
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,594
His name is Anu.
I love him.

721
00:46:31,594 --> 00:46:33,439
He's the one I want to be
one day.

722
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:34,806
Not for you!

723
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,812
Terror Boys ya?

724
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:01,510
No worries.
Do not Cry.

725
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:02,522
- Why is this?
- Principal ..

726
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:03,476
Students!

727
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:07,348
They all have been hanged.
And her father's contract was canceled.

728
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,613
- What?
- Where are you?

729
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:13,431
 We're ready.

730
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:14,431
Hello friends.

731
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:19,421
Valentine's Day Special Slots,
Terror Boys have failed! Let go!

732
00:47:20,356 --> 00:47:23,478
All junior are male boys
and my little sister.

733
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,925
Bullying is wrong!

734
00:47:57,103 --> 00:47:59,103
Happy Valentine's Day.

735
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:02,058
- Are you ready?
- The camera is ready?

736
00:48:02,058 --> 00:48:04,058
Ready, Jithu!
- Make sure your face looks.

737
00:48:04,723 --> 00:48:06,683
Do not hurt people
to severe!

738
00:48:06,848 --> 00:48:08,720
We have no money for
medical expenses.

739
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,354
Hey, Asif!
- Here it is, brother.

740
00:48:10,463 --> 00:48:12,576
Come on, save
our cultural custom!

741
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:02,113
Not Happy Valentine's Day.

742
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:03,868
But Happy New Bride!

743
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,516
Thirty-five thousand spectators.

744
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:12,431
Eight thousand likes.

745
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:17,041
We get a full score, Brother Jithu!
Full mark!

746
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,516
Being ranked 13th.

747
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:22,141
Is it okay to buy a beer?

748
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,041
Our party name is known
the whole country, Jithu!

749
00:49:25,575 --> 00:49:29,989
That's right. Dad will be happy.
But what can we do?

750
00:49:29,989 --> 00:49:30,890
Look at Jithu!

751
00:49:30,938 --> 00:49:34,390
There's someone to do like us
and they got hit.

752
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,966
Being ranked number 11.

753
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:44,596
Look at him.

754
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:45,930
Amjad Khan junior!

755
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:47,336
From the 60s.

756
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,582
A million views!

757
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:52,249
You can not even get out.

758
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,699
They made a video before and
after. They taunt us!

759
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,411
If we hit him early on ..

760
00:49:58,444 --> 00:49:59,563
... well he's gone!

761
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:02,030
I hear you say everything
and now I'm being beaten!

762
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:04,709
I lost honor!

763
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,747
What do you say?

764
00:50:07,747 --> 00:50:09,388
Get your dad away
from him.

765
00:50:09,388 --> 00:50:11,558
But now you are
already closed our business!

766
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:12,746
What kind of child are you?

767
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,933
What are you doing?
Drink and fight this morning?

768
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:25,433
You both have no ability
to hit the man!

769
00:50:25,473 --> 00:50:28,172
You! Come here!
- Auntie.

770
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:30,638
Go buy eggs in the store!
- Okay, auntie.

771
00:51:15,648 --> 00:51:19,013
The list is in the bag.
Give me a fresh stock.

772
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:21,183
How many are they all?

773
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:22,899
It feels like in 8 or 10 people.

774
00:51:22,899 --> 00:51:25,102
They are waiting
for 2 hours.

775
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:26,860
They are armed.

776
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:02,600
You're all right
unchanged.

777
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,745
The old rookie looks
funny and coming besieged!

778
00:52:06,745 --> 00:52:07,745
Bored right!

779
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:48,729
Run!

780
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,579
- Hey, you!
- Yes, brother.

781
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,289
Go pay for damages.
- Okay, brother.

782
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:05,629
Second or third house
in the Gomathi field?

783
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:07,095
Your second home sir.

784
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:09,135
Second home yes ..

785
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:31,911
At this time,
kids and dad drinking in the house!

786
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:33,246
What a wonderful family!

787
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:36,456
Hello, who are you?
- Hello ladies. My name is Kaali.

788
00:53:36,456 --> 00:53:39,331
I am the hostel's warden
your husband wants to hit.

789
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:41,956
If not trouble, I am
Want more coffee and more sugar.

790
00:53:42,816 --> 00:53:45,411
You dare to go home
me. I will ..

791
00:53:55,755 --> 00:53:57,260
If you touch me ..

792
00:53:57,956 --> 00:53:59,159
You know who I am?

793
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,438
You suffer because
 the mistake you made.

794
00:54:04,438 --> 00:54:07,294
Your son is missing education
and you lose money. That's all!

795
00:54:07,294 --> 00:54:10,419
But if you fucked me
again, you will lose your life.

796
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:14,629
This is my last time
forgive you both. Okay?

797
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:18,596
Listen to you, suppose
your kids have been dropped out of college.

798
00:54:18,613 --> 00:54:20,870
But we gave him the truth
to sit for the exam.

799
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:22,847
Have him answer exactly, get it
 degree and live well.

800
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:25,875
You can not stay in college for ages
live. You gotta get out of college.

801
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:27,723
Yes, cancel my tea!

802
00:54:28,817 --> 00:54:31,127
Hey, my glasses!
My glasses!

803
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:32,235
Thank you.

804
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,816
Study hard!

805
00:54:39,895 --> 00:54:41,416
When did you arrive?

806
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:43,141
Just come, sir.
- Okay, okay, okay.

807
00:54:43,165 --> 00:54:44,255
Thank you.
- See you again.

808
00:54:46,071 --> 00:54:47,154
Hey! Come on!

809
00:54:50,343 --> 00:54:51,903
Listen to me.

810
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,014
Michael, write fast.

811
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,750
Sir ..

812
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,175
What do you do?

813
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:01,437
It's ok..

814
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:07,561
You always record sounds
 trees and leaves!

815
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:09,420
Record their voices!

816
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:11,250
Truth sounds!

817
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:13,427
Mike!

818
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,156
Dormitory for party
farewell.

819
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:29,028
When finished, they
will return to their room.

820
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:31,772
If we go after that ..

821
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:33,494
..we can catch
them easily.

822
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,878
Your hostel will be watching
death today.

823
00:55:40,959 --> 00:55:41,579
Abang!

824
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:42,489
What is all this?

825
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:43,917
All these weapons for what?

826
00:55:44,013 --> 00:55:46,633
Dad! They may
will kill someone.

827
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:47,968
We're gonna kill somebody!

828
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:50,581
The warden!

829
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:53,930
Dad! We do not kill!
We just hit him ..

830
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:54,681
Michael!

831
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,149
He goes to our house
and hit your dad!

832
00:55:57,174 --> 00:55:59,302
How can we let him?
He needs to die!

833
00:55:59,302 --> 00:56:01,538
- He remembered who he was?
- Listen!

834
00:56:03,065 --> 00:56:05,425
Dad, we do not kill him.

835
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:08,973
If we hit him enough-
enough he will run forever!

836
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:10,261
Why are you torturing daddy!

837
00:56:10,725 --> 00:56:12,331
Honor father is betting!

838
00:56:13,097 --> 00:56:14,972
Dad can not let it go!

839
00:56:16,598 --> 00:56:18,857
It scares me, dad.

840
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,057
Please do not!

841
00:56:21,175 --> 00:56:22,468
Help me!

842
00:56:23,137 --> 00:56:24,340
All right.

843
00:56:24,409 --> 00:56:25,618
We do not kill him.

844
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:28,546
Do you understand?

845
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:31,633
Listen not? Just beat him.
<i> - What are you talking about? </ i>

846
00:56:31,684 --> 00:56:33,756
No need to kill today.
Keep all the guns inside.

847
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:35,836
Go save! Go!

848
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:38,523
I will show the warden and
some students. Beat them. That's all.

849
00:56:38,523 --> 00:56:39,284
Okay!

850
00:56:39,514 --> 00:56:40,498
Okay, Michael.

851
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:43,926
I'll go once.

852
00:56:44,014 --> 00:56:47,233
The hostel will be welcomed
celebration, today!

853
01:00:55,344 --> 01:00:56,093
Abang!

854
01:00:56,093 --> 01:00:59,150
Remember what your father said.
Do not kill. Just beat them!

855
01:01:02,217 --> 01:01:04,944
Great song
from Mr. Kaali!

856
01:01:06,903 --> 01:01:09,982
How much is Chittu! Why
You dance like that?

857
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:13,860
I learned the dance of Bharanatayam,
Kuchipudi during grade 4.

858
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,282
Great!

859
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,593
He believes what
I said.

860
01:01:17,593 --> 01:01:19,393
I will dance and show
on you tomorrow!

861
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,195
Sir! Sleep well!

862
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:38,181
<i> I'll surprise you early
and show me my dance! </ i>

863
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,086
Good night, Mangalam!

864
01:02:29,404 --> 01:02:31,329
To the edge. Who are you?

865
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:34,224
- Do not hit us!
- To the edge!

866
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:39,441
To the edge. The edge!

867
01:02:44,003 --> 01:02:45,264
Who is that?

868
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:53,457
Hey! Who are you?

869
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:55,603
- Release us! Help me!
- Hey, to the edge!

870
01:02:56,662 --> 01:02:57,469
Anwar!

871
01:02:59,718 --> 01:03:01,864
Please do not! Help me!

872
01:03:04,332 --> 01:03:05,956
Please release him!

873
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:09,241
Release him. Help me!

874
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,474
I told you not
Bring weapons!

875
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:31,024
Who told you to carry a weapon?

876
01:03:32,374 --> 01:03:34,135
Hey! Why are you attacking me?

877
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:39,058
Hey! Who are you?

878
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:44,140
Do not!

879
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,364
Go in!

880
01:04:05,688 --> 01:04:07,471
Michael! What happen?

881
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,153
Abang! Who are they?

882
01:04:09,153 --> 01:04:10,572
How many people are
what are you bringing

883
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,011
- Talk!
- Six. Six people.

884
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:16,068
Tell people to show you the face.
- Open a mask!

885
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:49,770
Anwar!

886
01:05:50,871 --> 01:05:53,330
Show your hand.
It's bleeding!

887
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:54,583
Get your people off.

888
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:58,637
Do not worry. Nothing.

889
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,132
I told them to go!

890
01:06:03,188 --> 01:06:05,418
Go! Go!

891
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:07,676
Hey! Take him to the hospital!

892
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:17,472
Sir, we take him to the hospital.

893
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:19,205
Do not. Give him
first aid treatment.

894
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:20,979
No one
can leave this place.

895
01:06:22,417 --> 01:06:24,062
This problem is still pending.

896
01:06:25,577 --> 01:06:27,932

It's my problem.

Our master is there for you.

957
01:10:25,482 --> 01:10:28,053
I do not say you have to do it.
I said you must!

958
01:10:28,053 --> 01:10:29,233
You must! Okay!

959
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:03,893
Hey! Nunchaku!

01:13:39,959 --> 01:13:41,892
Hey! Who is this?

962
01:13:41,892 --> 01:13:43,905
I told you?
He's the warden!

01:13:44,328 --> 01:13:45,413
Warden ya?

01:13:45,413 --> 01:13:47,140
Looks like he's waiting for us!

01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,395
No more!

966
01:13:48,395 --> 01:13:50,155
He's waiting for us!

967
01:13:51,757 --> 01:13:56,688
If you care about it
wife and child, then run!

968
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:00,427
I'm in the mood to kill!
And I'll kill you all!

969
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:04,810
Where are you going

970
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,160
Hey! Come here!
- Let's go !!

971
01:15:11,682 --> 01:15:13,114
There is sound from above. Go!

972
01:15:17,038 --> 01:15:17,947
We have to find a way out!

973
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:20,319
- But he's ordering to wait here!
- Hey! Just make it!

974
01:15:22,493 --> 01:15:24,514
Go look!
You went too!

975
01:15:27,646 --> 01:15:28,566
Not here!

976
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:06,832
Hey! I can hear the sound
that student. Come on!

977
01:16:29,154 --> 01:16:31,239
Useless! He deceives us!

978
01:16:47,682 --> 01:16:48,445
Dad!

979
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,726
I have sent 20 people.

980
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:54,545
There is a dormitory warden.

981
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,449
It's all over everyone.

982
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:05,092
How old was the warden?

983
01:17:07,032 --> 01:17:08,104
Why?

984
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,754
How old is it?

985
01:17:12,098 --> 01:17:14,380
It's not very young
to hit them!

986
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:22,035
Kaali?

987
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:24,924
How is he doing?
- Sir, you ..

988
01:17:24,924 --> 01:17:27,134
I'm her friend.
What about him?

989
01:17:27,134 --> 01:17:30,139
Sir, he was injured. He lost
blood. But it's not dangerous to you.

990
01:17:31,809 --> 01:17:34,180
Give me water. Help me!

991
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:36,818
This is it.

992
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,555
She told me while
we talked last week.

993
01:17:38,555 --> 01:17:41,652
He can feel there
something big will happen.

994
01:17:43,007 --> 01:17:45,164
- It has happened.
- Sir, who is he?

995
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,759

Anwar ..!

998
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,543
Who are you?

999
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,708
Who is he?

1000
01:18:07,086 --> 01:18:08,727
Who am I, sir?

1001
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:20,973
Hello.

1002
01:18:20,973 --> 01:18:23,866
Mr. Jithu, my man

01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,365
He saw the warden, sir.

1004
01:18:25,379 --> 01:18:26,309
You have a picture of him?

1005
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:29,666
You sent a video
there's a college boy in it right?

1006
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:30,952
In that video ..
- At the end of the video ..

1007
01:18:30,952 --> 01:18:33,523
At the end of the video,
You will see the warden.

1008
01:18:33,523 --> 01:18:36,182
My people see and tell
me. You go look.

1009
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:40,170
Your mom needs to raise it
You and not tell me anything.

1010
01:18:40,334 --> 01:18:43,421
Yes, that's what
we want.

1011
01:18:43,747 --> 01:18:45,351
But ..

1012
01:18:45,924 --> 01:18:47,938
It's time for you to know.

1013
01:18:47,938 --> 01:18:50,060
Your father's name is Malik!

1014
01:18:50,252 --> 01:18:53,874
Malik son Abdul Marakkayar
from Madurai.

1015
01:19:00,423 --> 01:19:02,503
She saw her end of the video.

1016
01:19:10,601 --> 01:19:11,322
Stop.

1017
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:28,097
People who take care and
risk your life to protect you ..

1018
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,217
He..

1019
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:31,768
You know who he is?

1020
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,669
You know who he is?

1021
01:19:40,523 --> 01:19:41,840
Petta Velan!

1022
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:44,506
We always call him ..

1023
01:19:50,216 --> 01:19:51,601
Petta!

1024
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,267
PETTA !!!

1025
01:20:29,085 --> 01:20:31,741
Please do not go that way.

1026
01:20:32,734 --> 01:20:34,839
We have to make a decision today!

1027
01:20:34,883 --> 01:20:36,228
Why aunt?

1028
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:38,367
Why suddenly get together?

1029
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:39,458
What is it?

1030
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:42,638
Get your dad up.
Let's talk to him about this!

1031
01:20:42,662 --> 01:20:45,584
<i> He's praying now.
Speak when he comes later. </ I>

1032
01:20:45,584 --> 01:20:46,669
<i> All right. </ i>

1033
01:20:49,605 --> 01:20:52,150
I hear you are
Powerful District Officer.

1034
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:54,803
I hear you run
well done while in Madurai.

1035
01:20:54,803 --> 01:20:57,338
Here you also support thugs.

1036
01:20:57,338 --> 01:20:58,935
Who are you calling the thugs?

1037
01:20:58,935 --> 01:21:01,322
We are against
the famous sand mafia.

1038
01:21:01,322 --> 01:21:02,697
And you call us gangsters?

1039
01:21:02,697 --> 01:21:03,966
Brother, listen here.

1040
01:21:03,966 --> 01:21:06,598
Do not remember your brother can
shut up our mouth with money.

1041
01:21:06,598 --> 01:21:08,604
We are brothers and sisters!

1042
01:21:08,692 --> 01:21:10,884
We are also entitled
all that property.

1043
01:21:10,884 --> 01:21:11,867
Auntie..

1044
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,214
Looks like aunt
palace on the clouds!

1045
01:21:14,614 --> 01:21:16,011
Greedy feeling
it can kill.

1046
01:21:16,119 --> 01:21:18,170
- Hey, you wanna hang on us?
- You're gonna kill us?

1047
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:20,482
Rajapandi and his two sons ..

1048
01:21:20,482 --> 01:21:23,003
.. easily steal
sand using road ..

1049
01:21:23,028 --> 01:21:25,257
..personal
to their home.

1050
01:21:25,266 --> 01:21:27,416
Just because we have it
this house, do not remember ..

1051
01:21:27,441 --> 01:21:29,669
..we can easily get money only
by stealing sand?

1052
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:31,242
Do not you know what the trouble we are going through?

1053
01:21:31,242 --> 01:21:33,146
We can forgive
if they only make money!

1054
01:21:33,146 --> 01:21:35,868
But the river's water level has fallen
up to 40 feet.

1055
01:21:35,868 --> 01:21:39,437
If this continues,
do not say farming,

1056
01:21:39,437 --> 01:21:41,852
Drinking water no
enough for us!

1057
01:21:50,809 --> 01:21:51,329
Go!

1058
01:21:51,329 --> 01:21:54,570
His father, Abdul Ayya, is
the first person to oppose it.

1059
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:57,078
And you know how
Devaram and its key ..

1060
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,406
..make a crash
and kill him.

1061
01:21:59,406 --> 01:21:59,983
So?

1062
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:00,923
Already!

1063
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:04,635
I tolerate with
You because we are siblings.

1064
01:22:04,635 --> 01:22:06,105
But stop plucking!

1065
01:22:06,105 --> 01:22:07,479
Get out of here!

1066
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:10,742
Nobody will
can be anything. Get them off!

1067
01:22:10,742 --> 01:22:13,495
- Get up. Go!
- How can you treat us like this?

1068
01:22:13,585 --> 01:22:14,675
Listen to me.

1069
01:22:14,788 --> 01:22:18,455
Devaram did not pay anything
of the money they earn.

1070
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:21,258
But at the same time
they fund ..

1071
01:22:21,258 --> 01:22:23,430
..must your main
in the party.

1072
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,877
If you hear us and
catch him,

1073
01:22:25,877 --> 01:22:28,736
it shows the reaction
because he ignores you ..

1074
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:32,837
..and this action will cause
funding on the part of the enemy will cease.

1075
01:22:32,837 --> 01:22:35,713
So, more
which you will get.

1076
01:22:36,941 --> 01:22:38,824
I love what I hear.

1077
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:40,949
What do you want me to do

1078
01:22:40,974 --> 01:22:43,332
They're not afraid of us anymore!

1079
01:22:43,332 --> 01:22:48,072
And you've missed the contract
dig a sand to Malik!

1080
01:22:48,287 --> 01:22:50,723
Not daddy. District Officer
be on their side!

1081
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:52,687
Now the contract is in Malik's hands.

1082
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,875
Even until now,
they are still digging sand.

1083
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:57,590
We'll catch them
with evidence.

1084
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:59,466
Just catch them!

1085
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:00,466
Evidence?

1086
01:23:00,616 --> 01:23:03,437
Petta will go get the evidence.
Think you're done.

1087
01:23:08,789 --> 01:23:09,947
Greetings boss!

1088
01:23:10,574 --> 01:23:12,448
What happen?
All done?

1089
01:23:12,473 --> 01:23:14,766
- Can we order the lorry?
- Yes, tell them to go!

1090
01:23:14,855 --> 01:23:18,823
- Trucks can be circulated.
- Turn on the engine!

1091
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:34,255
Brother?
They want to go!

1092
01:23:46,196 --> 01:23:48,726
Stop all lorries! No one
can go from here!

1093
01:23:48,726 --> 01:23:49,528
Okay, brother.

1094
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:54,645
The sand is still wet and they are
It's okay, it's okay!

1095
01:23:54,645 --> 01:23:56,269
Take pictures of it all!
It's all proof!

1096
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:04,594
Abang! Petta and the people-
the man is here!

1097
01:24:04,822 --> 01:24:06,697
Take all the weapons!

1098
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:12,684
Hey! Boy!

1099
01:24:12,684 --> 01:24:15,590
Go tell your brother!
He's over!

1100
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:16,955
Hey! Go!

1101
01:24:22,785 --> 01:24:25,641
Everything will end
if you stole me?

1102
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:27,282
I'll be out soon.

1103
01:24:27,421 --> 01:24:28,279
Go.

1104
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:30,139
And I'll steal sand again.

1105
01:24:30,139 --> 01:24:32,833
Make it! I will shoot
you once again!

1106
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:36,362
Hey! You write ready! I will
kill you both!

1107
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:37,294
Oops!

1108
01:24:37,294 --> 01:24:38,920
I forgot my pen and paper.

1109
01:24:39,629 --> 01:24:40,946
Go!

1110
01:24:46,072 --> 01:24:47,969
Why Poongodi
looks angry?

1111
01:24:47,978 --> 01:24:50,904
He's down to our cause
Put her brother to jail?

1112
01:24:50,904 --> 01:24:52,800
Something wrong, brother!

1113
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,621
She is pregnant.

1114
01:25:02,518 --> 01:25:04,066
Hey! Do not mess up.

1115
01:25:04,066 --> 01:25:06,477
These two families
like an enemy to death!

1116
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:07,947
They are the ones who kill
Abdul's father!

1117
01:25:07,947 --> 01:25:11,203
I have a problem when
she says she's in love with her.

1118
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,810
Abang!

1119
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:15,452
Love is blind.

1120
01:25:15,452 --> 01:25:18,353
Yes. The eyes are not working
in love! But another good thing!

1121
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:23,263
Go talk to her.

1122
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,729
I want to help
with who else?

1123
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:32,684
I have a problem of love.
Will you help me?

1124
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:39,029
Get them out!
- Hey! Go! Go! Get out!

1125
01:25:39,598 --> 01:25:40,973
Hey! go!

1126
01:25:42,618 --> 01:25:43,835
Go.

1127
01:25:44,746 --> 01:25:48,755
- Sir, listen first!
- Hey! Rajapandi!

1128
01:25:48,755 --> 01:25:52,150
Why do you allow people
how are you getting into the house?

1129
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:54,327
- Get them out of this house.
- Yes, tell them to go.

1130
01:25:54,684 --> 01:25:56,172
Hey! Clowns!

1131
01:25:57,372 --> 01:25:59,546
Why are they so much talk?

1132
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,804
I feel angry like that
I want to break her head.

1133
01:26:01,804 --> 01:26:03,744
I was angry too!
I'm in the wind!

1134
01:26:03,845 --> 01:26:06,336
But this is something sensitive.
You have made a mistake.

1135
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,476
What am I doing?

1136
01:26:11,881 --> 01:26:12,958
Sir ..

1137
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:16,878
I do not believe in caste,
color, race or religion!

1138
01:26:16,878 --> 01:26:18,063
He made mistakes.

1139
01:26:18,063 --> 01:26:20,523
He wants to be sorry and
he's sorry!

1140
01:26:20,523 --> 01:26:21,840
Let me explain one thing.

1141
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,496
Poongodi will only be happy
when married to him.

1142
01:26:24,573 --> 01:26:28,042
Think wisely
and marry them!

1143
01:26:28,085 --> 01:26:32,055
And never again
You try to hurt your son!

1144
01:26:32,206 --> 01:26:35,037
As long as I was there, his father was
will not touch it!

1145
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:36,566
See you again!

1146
01:26:42,847 --> 01:26:45,063
<i> She conceived a child
different caste! </ i>

1147
01:26:45,063 --> 01:26:47,821
<i> He's dumping charcoal to our face! </ i>

1148
01:26:47,821 --> 01:26:49,483
<i> Kill him! </ i>

1149
01:26:57,808 --> 01:27:00,613
Dad can not imagine
is under one ..

1150
01:27:00,638 --> 01:27:03,379
..bumbung with them
as a family.

1151
01:27:03,477 --> 01:27:06,750
Caste has been rooted
in father's lineage!

1152
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:10,091
At the same time
Dad can not see you crying.

1153
01:27:10,587 --> 01:27:14,147
If you marry him
will make you happy ..

1154
01:27:15,173 --> 01:27:16,585
Go ahead.

1155
01:27:18,054 --> 01:27:21,769
Even though you have sinned,
You're still the father's daughter!

1156
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:23,240
- Dad!
- Go, get married with her.

1157
01:27:23,617 --> 01:27:25,599
- Dad!
- May you be happy!

1158
01:27:26,243 --> 01:27:28,507
Singaram! Do not let it
they miss!

1159
01:27:28,646 --> 01:27:30,774
Do not miss anyone!

1160
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,378
This marriage can not be
going on! Go!

1161
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:39,413
Listen to father.
Do not do that.

1162
01:27:39,413 --> 01:27:42,354
Listen to father.
Just let him.

1163
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:44,710
Anyway ..
he is our daughter!

1164
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:46,285
- Do not ..
- So?

1165
01:27:46,285 --> 01:27:48,815
Dad asked me to send
she is in the man?

1166
01:27:49,187 --> 01:27:50,480
Our dignity is a bet!

1167
01:27:50,662 --> 01:27:53,444
We will not
raise our face again!

1168
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,712
I do not mind if he's dead!

1169
01:27:55,913 --> 01:27:57,711
This marriage is not
will take place!

1170
01:27:58,358 --> 01:28:00,372
You can not do anything.

1171
01:28:00,372 --> 01:28:03,170
Petta takes care of it
and Petta will certainly betray him!

1172
01:29:13,813 --> 01:29:15,644
What are you doing here?

1173
01:29:22,114 --> 01:29:24,116
PETTA !!!

1174
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:33,758
Stay calm, bride!

1175
01:29:33,783 --> 01:29:35,665
Happy New Bride!
- Okay, brother.

1176
01:29:35,933 --> 01:29:37,808
Dare you right?

1177
01:29:38,687 --> 01:29:43,275
You should bring a gift but you
racket in here with a gun?

1178
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:47,131
I'm really angry with you!
But this is a special day!

1179
01:29:47,323 --> 01:29:50,052
But it's not sweet to send people
back from wedding ceremony ..

1180
01:29:50,077 --> 01:29:50,968
..with empty hands!

1181
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,030
So, here's my gift!

1182
01:30:47,139 --> 01:30:49,229
Abang! Abang!

1183
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,775
The brother has managed
for tonight?

1184
01:30:53,563 --> 01:30:56,025
This night? Abang dah
do not prepare?

1185
01:30:59,182 --> 01:31:01,300
I'll make it
for this 'night'.

1186
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:08,468
Devaram, video evidence
it's very strong.

1187
01:31:08,603 --> 01:31:10,135
Otherwise, of course we are
Get you out early.

1188
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,341
Listen! I'll do it
three murders!

1189
01:31:12,366 --> 01:31:14,366
Make what's right!

1190
01:31:14,393 --> 01:31:16,180
Hey! Relax.

1191
01:31:16,205 --> 01:31:18,872
I'm worried you will
say something like this!

1192
01:31:18,889 --> 01:31:20,223
There is something
I want to tell you.

1193
01:31:20,223 --> 01:31:20,741
What is it?

1194
01:31:20,756 --> 01:31:24,513
Your dad called me overnight and begged
I put the house on behalf of Poongodi.

1195
01:31:24,513 --> 01:31:26,080
All the property on the pig's name is that?

1196
01:31:47,202 --> 01:31:49,019
He is a lucky amulet
this family!

1197
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:53,506
His birth has been given
we are what we have now.

1198
01:31:53,807 --> 01:31:55,343
They are of different caste!

1199
01:31:55,372 --> 01:31:59,054
Yes. This is a shame!
But dad can not see him crying.

1200
01:31:59,232 --> 01:32:00,907
She's a little princess of dad.

1201
01:32:02,346 --> 01:32:06,331
Dad did not know what
to save her from you.

1202
01:32:17,111 --> 01:32:18,255
Listen!

1203
01:32:18,843 --> 01:32:21,003
Now you will live
with the money available.

1204
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:25,212
It is written in father's will.
Just let him continue living.

1205
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:29,910
I should not kill her, right?

1206
01:32:30,944 --> 01:32:31,837
All right.

1207
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:35,720
If I kill him, I'm
will not get the money right?

1208
01:32:36,799 --> 01:32:37,719
Well.

1209
01:32:48,792 --> 01:32:49,890
If I killed my dad?

1210
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:56,238
I can kill my dad, right?

1211
01:32:57,490 --> 01:33:00,260
If I killed my dad,
I'll still get the money. Right?

1212
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,367
She calls you princess, and she
Serves you equally.

1213
01:33:33,533 --> 01:33:35,533
She loves you like her!

1214
01:33:35,557 --> 01:33:37,400
And now you've got it!

1215
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:39,551
Who took his life?

1216
01:33:40,455 --> 01:33:41,667
I want to know.

1217
01:33:41,667 --> 01:33:43,532
My dad is not dead
because of pain!

1218
01:33:43,532 --> 01:33:45,498
Someone has killed him!

1219
01:33:45,846 --> 01:33:47,539
I know!

1220
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:53,243
And that guy is you!

1221
01:33:53,472 --> 01:33:55,108
You who killed my dad!

1222
01:33:55,532 --> 01:33:58,222
Poongodi! Why do you want to
blame your brother

1223
01:33:58,524 --> 01:34:01,312
Your dad died because of a broken heart,
because you marry run.

1224
01:34:02,063 --> 01:34:03,348
Who is marrying?

1225
01:34:03,652 --> 01:34:05,307
Her father has given her a blessing!

1226
01:34:05,511 --> 01:34:08,343
His dad sent him and worried
how to manage you all!

1227
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:11,016
Hey! Do not be scared!

1228
01:34:11,016 --> 01:34:15,288
Dad to kill you while
they came to apply!

1229
01:34:15,288 --> 01:34:20,027
He put things on my behalf
to protect me from you both!

1230
01:34:20,106 --> 01:34:22,444
I'm worried when I'm
heard it.

1231
01:34:22,577 --> 01:34:24,831
And then I can
the news of his death.

1232
01:34:24,831 --> 01:34:28,336
Answer it. You killed
is he for money?

1233
01:34:28,336 --> 01:34:30,637
Are you killing my dad?

1234
01:34:30,637 --> 01:34:32,930
Shut up! Khinzir
do not know grateful!

1235
01:34:33,977 --> 01:34:35,836
Yes. I killed him.
So what?

1236
01:34:38,771 --> 01:34:40,138
Not just because of money.

1237
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:43,918
But he strikes you with
subordinates. That is why!

1238
01:34:45,228 --> 01:34:46,870
He will not stop here!

1239
01:34:47,064 --> 01:34:51,420
Next you, then
your husband and so on Petta!

1240
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,148
I will kill
everyone!

1241
01:34:53,148 --> 01:34:54,318
Hey! Malik!

1242
01:34:54,318 --> 01:34:56,735
I'm not going to let go
You are not born this!

1243
01:34:56,735 --> 01:34:58,967
I will kill everybody!

1244
01:34:58,967 --> 01:35:01,541
Our dignity is a bet here!

1245
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:03,489
I'm willing to kill
as much as the devil!

1246
01:35:05,201 --> 01:35:07,126
He killed his father.

1247
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:09,775
Now he's killing
blood of his own flesh.

1248
01:35:09,775 --> 01:35:14,093
So you think ...
Will not he try to kill us too?

1249
01:35:14,093 --> 01:35:15,477
Of course.

1250
01:35:16,936 --> 01:35:19,032
Hey! Have a pig!
- Who do you want to kill?

1251
01:35:19,132 --> 01:35:20,858
How about us
delete him first?

1252
01:35:21,187 --> 01:35:22,494
Delete him?

1253
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,243
You mean to kill her?

1254
01:35:24,371 --> 01:35:25,588
Yes.

1255
01:35:25,645 --> 01:35:29,142
You're a bit weak!
We can get him out of here.

1256
01:35:29,142 --> 01:35:33,794
But Devaram is dangerous.
We'll kill him. Now, here.

1257
01:35:33,843 --> 01:35:34,886
Now?

1258
01:35:34,886 --> 01:35:36,412
- Keep away from me!
- I'm sorry you killed me!

1259
01:35:36,512 --> 01:35:40,517
I'll be jailed no more than
4 months. Do not worry about me!

1260
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,744
Why do you want to go to jail?
Let me just come in!

1261
01:35:42,744 --> 01:35:43,899
I will not
can you do it for your brother !?

1262
01:35:43,899 --> 01:35:47,273
You steal up, dumb? Everyone
worth the redemption of his own!

1263
01:35:47,273 --> 01:35:48,660
Malik, you make a decision.

1264
01:35:53,817 --> 01:35:56,992
He is the brother of Poongodi.
That's what I have to think about.

1265
01:35:56,992 --> 01:35:58,417
We ask him too.

1266
01:35:59,281 --> 01:36:02,312
You think that's alright
without reason.

1267
01:36:02,571 --> 01:36:03,825
- Adik!
- Yes its me.

1268
01:36:03,825 --> 01:36:05,013
Call Poongodi.

1269
01:36:07,235 --> 01:36:11,730
Go! You're not my brother anymore.
Get out of here.

1270
01:36:11,877 --> 01:36:13,915
See how proud it is
he's after he killed my dad.

1271
01:36:14,006 --> 01:36:16,892
I give you 5 minutes
to get out of this place!

1272
01:36:16,892 --> 01:36:17,770
Abang!

1273
01:36:17,829 --> 01:36:19,402
Make something.

1274
01:36:19,427 --> 01:36:20,666
Kill him.

1275
01:36:25,994 --> 01:36:27,838
Petta also recommend objects
The same.

1276
01:36:28,195 --> 01:36:30,178
We'll kill him right now.

1277
01:36:34,216 --> 01:36:35,453
Poongodi!

1278
01:36:36,313 --> 01:36:39,376
Devaram will not let it
we live safely!

1279
01:36:39,504 --> 01:36:42,497
We have to do what
we should do a long time ago.

1280
01:36:42,722 --> 01:36:44,166
What do you say?

1281
01:36:44,626 --> 01:36:46,049
I'm scared!

1282
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,737
No, Saro!

1283
01:36:48,163 --> 01:36:50,047
I think
cooking.

1284
01:36:50,213 --> 01:36:52,106
Estimates I will not miss!

1285
01:36:52,931 --> 01:36:54,362
Tell your decision.

1286
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:56,759
I'm waiting for the answer from you.

1287
01:37:01,365 --> 01:37:02,439
All right.

1288
01:37:04,183 --> 01:37:05,756
Kill him!

1289
01:37:15,041 --> 01:37:16,669
Hey! Petta. Do you want to go back?

1290
01:37:16,946 --> 01:37:19,653
After this, many occasions
the fun you are going to attend.

1291
01:37:45,155 --> 01:37:48,035
Why Petta?
I'm looking for a problem?

1292
01:37:50,048 --> 01:37:51,691
Listen here, Devaram.

1293
01:37:51,764 --> 01:37:54,199
If you decide to kill,
then kill it!

1294
01:37:54,623 --> 01:37:56,321
Do not just talk.

1295
01:38:08,714 --> 01:38:09,910
Brother ..

1296
01:38:18,636 --> 01:38:23,135
All stood on the ground
each one!

1297
01:38:23,691 --> 01:38:27,912
People who want to be
The third corpse can go forward!

1298
01:38:29,007 --> 01:38:30,150
Good!

1299
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:32,446
Hey! Singaram ..

1300
01:38:32,701 --> 01:38:35,456
Your cruelty to this day alone!

1301
01:38:36,055 --> 01:38:37,999
Run the last event for the deceased ..

1302
01:38:38,024 --> 01:38:40,771
..believe and exit
from here with your people.

1303
01:38:40,796 --> 01:38:44,754
If you have trouble,
I'll shoot you all!

1304
01:38:44,825 --> 01:38:46,612
I'm in the kill mode!

1305
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:48,016
Do you understand?

1306
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:51,764
Hey! Your payment is double.
Play it!

1307
01:39:15,516 --> 01:39:19,030
He is canceled in the last minute.
He made the decision.

1308
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:21,774
We've used contacts
we and try to bribe him.

1309
01:39:21,803 --> 01:39:22,939
He did not want to!

1310
01:39:24,567 --> 01:39:28,437
When you cook, cook it here!
With love!

1311
01:39:31,438 --> 01:39:32,875
What happen?

1312
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:34,129
He does not want to hear it.

1313
01:39:34,224 --> 01:39:36,120
Hey, come on!

1314
01:39:36,567 --> 01:39:40,018
Malik! Malik! Release me!
I'll listen to you.

1315
01:39:41,146 --> 01:39:43,039
- Stop!
- I'll follow you.

1316
01:39:55,235 --> 01:39:58,061
Chinna! Do not play
kat kitchen. Go.

1317
01:39:58,254 --> 01:39:59,355
Dad!

1318
01:39:59,355 --> 01:40:00,879
Hey! Get out!

1319
01:40:07,548 --> 01:40:09,738
Who are you?
Why is it so arrogant?

1320
01:40:09,984 --> 01:40:12,221
Dhoti down!
I said it!

1321
01:40:13,303 --> 01:40:15,074
There's a reason why the land
like this!

1322
01:40:15,171 --> 01:40:16,429
Where are we?
to release them

1323
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:24,322
His parents left him orphaned
the paternity at the temple of Petta Velan and gone.

1324
01:40:24,447 --> 01:40:27,772
Dad my dad
he returned to our house.

1325
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:31,717
And that's why he is
named Petta Velan!

1326
01:40:31,754 --> 01:40:35,654
And when the brother comes home
We, lucky to go with him.

1327
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:38,728
Yes. Like the first one she told me,

1328
01:40:38,753 --> 01:40:40,590
..and you're all like that
just heard it!

1329
01:40:40,615 --> 01:40:43,888
She's all for me.
And I belong to her.

1330
01:40:43,888 --> 01:40:44,837
Is not it, brother?

1331
01:40:45,006 --> 01:40:49,127
We will return the land
hijacked by Devaram from you!

1332
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:51,312
Soils like little ones.
Take good care.

1333
01:41:05,409 --> 01:41:09,589
In our custom, swing
stomach will be made during the 7th month.

1334
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:13,058
So what? We will do it
in the tenth month.

1335
01:41:13,058 --> 01:41:14,977
And we'll do like
your custom tradition.

1336
01:41:19,512 --> 01:41:22,266
- Hopefully you are blessed.
- Have a healthy and cheerful baby.

1337
01:41:23,599 --> 01:41:25,012
How much, brother?

1338
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,752
- Are you ready?
- It looks pretty!

1339
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:29,929
Saro, if we can
more children?

1340
01:41:29,929 --> 01:41:31,232
Oops! Do not kidding!

1341
01:41:31,259 --> 01:41:33,308
Brother, look who comes here!

1342
01:41:37,752 --> 01:41:39,662
Why are you coming here?
- I want to meet my brother.

1343
01:41:39,662 --> 01:41:41,332
You can not go in. Stop!

1344
01:41:41,706 --> 01:41:43,424
- My brother..
- Wait.

1345
01:41:43,424 --> 01:41:45,551
Hey, let her come in.
What do you want?

1346
01:41:45,551 --> 01:41:46,645
Petta! Forgive me.

1347
01:41:47,526 --> 01:41:49,131
Malik. Forgive me.

1348
01:41:49,435 --> 01:41:51,753
I have no right to be forgiven.

1349
01:41:53,203 --> 01:41:59,809
I fool myself
the violence is my flesh blood.

1350
01:41:59,809 --> 01:42:01,073
When I was so orphaned ..

1351
01:42:01,484 --> 01:42:05,636
When I'm away. Then
I realized the truth!

1352
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:07,666
I moved home
like a nomad.

1353
01:42:08,572 --> 01:42:09,908
Finally I settled in the north.

1354
01:42:10,115 --> 01:42:12,914
I got a job there
and continue my life.

1355
01:42:12,914 --> 01:42:15,752
But my heart remains here.

1356
01:42:17,509 --> 01:42:19,278
She's all I have.

1357
01:42:19,662 --> 01:42:21,393
I was informed that day
this is a day to loose stomach.

1358
01:42:21,432 --> 01:42:22,378
So I came.

1359
01:42:23,695 --> 01:42:24,832
Forgive me!

1360
01:42:25,585 --> 01:42:27,939
- Go. Go!

1361
01:42:27,939 --> 01:42:28,963
Go!

1362
01:42:32,624 --> 01:42:35,326
- Abang ..
- Malik, not wrong to be a good person.

1363
01:42:35,612 --> 01:42:37,306
But do not be too good.

1364
01:42:45,757 --> 01:42:47,501
- Chinna!
- Yes, uncle.

1365
01:42:48,017 --> 01:42:50,717
Come here. Go play!
- He's coming?

1366
01:42:50,717 --> 01:42:52,189
You know me too?

1367
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:56,358
Are not you afraid of my brother and
ask brother to be a good person?

1368
01:42:56,358 --> 01:42:57,722
That is why the brother came not to tell.

1369
01:43:02,877 --> 01:43:04,216
Forgive me brother.

1370
01:43:04,392 --> 01:43:07,137
This life is for my brother to understand
the family is everything.

1371
01:43:16,773 --> 01:43:17,894
Give it to me.

1372
01:43:28,195 --> 01:43:29,485
Good luck.

1373
01:43:30,366 --> 01:43:32,558
She shows her affection.

1374
01:43:32,759 --> 01:43:36,000
Brother? Why give it on
me? Drag the family chain.

1375
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,437
Keep it safe.

1376
01:43:38,549 --> 01:43:41,118
Knowing that one day,
Your child will return this prize.

1377
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:43,280
Prize from the crew. Then
brother will accept.

1378
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:44,701
May you be blessed.

1379
01:43:51,656 --> 01:43:53,737
Your leg still not yet recovered?

1380
01:43:54,955 --> 01:43:56,994
He is getting better.
Slowly.

1381
01:43:57,162 --> 01:43:59,830
It's a powerful blow!
- See who hit him.

1382
01:44:00,221 --> 01:44:01,657
Are you okay?

1383
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:06,362
Go.

1384
01:44:06,362 --> 01:44:08,564
The stomach has been made
as you want.

1385
01:44:08,588 --> 01:44:11,266
Your brother came too.
Are you glad not

1386
01:44:12,489 --> 01:44:13,933
Brother, District Officer phone.

1387
01:44:15,158 --> 01:44:17,495
- Talk sir.
- Petta, why on your phone?

1388
01:44:17,495 --> 01:44:20,487
I heard, Singaram
come here.

1389
01:44:20,535 --> 01:44:25,289
My friend's cop, he told me there's a gang
from suspicious North India comes.

1390
01:44:25,289 --> 01:44:27,678
This news bothered me.
That's why I call.

1391
01:44:27,872 --> 01:44:30,196
If he comes there,
do not let him in!

1392
01:44:30,561 --> 01:44:32,807
Petta? Petta? Did you hear that?

1393
01:44:32,807 --> 01:44:34,117
Petta? Hello!

1394
01:45:00,945 --> 01:45:01,715

01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:34,751
Chinna!

1407
01:45:36,805 --> 01:45:38,331
Sister?

1408
01:45:41,811 --> 01:45:43,696
He has destroyed us!

1409
01:45:43,812 --> 01:45:45,899
He betrayed us!

1410
01:45:46,232 --> 01:45:48,232
I will ...

1411
01:45:50,682 --> 01:45:51,786

Malik!

1413
01:46:13,348 --> 01:46:14,465
That baby!

1414
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:19,453
Malik.

1415
01:46:19,907 --> 01:46:20,927
Malik!

1416
01:46:21,486 --> 01:46:22,474
Malik !!

1417

Malik?

1418
01:47:21,774 --> 01:47:22,837
Petta?

1419
01:47:24,123 --> 01:47:25,956
Poongodi sayang!

1420
01:47:27,553 --> 01:47:28,870
Poongodi!

1421
01:47:34,762 --> 01:47:36,048
Clowns?

1422
01:47:40,837 --> 01:47:42,013
Petta!

1423
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:46,752
Petta my dear!

1424
01:47:50,236 --> 01:47:51,625
Strong blows !?

1425
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:54,284
Petta!

1426
01:48:00,415 --> 01:48:02,083
See who's hit!

1427
01:48:15,764 --> 01:48:16,724
Nothing!

1428
01:48:16,724 --> 01:48:18,161
I'll kill him!
- Stop! Petta! Stop!

1429
01:48:18,161 --> 01:48:20,564
Stop Petta!
First of all we have to live!

1430
01:48:20,564 --> 01:48:22,780
Revenge can wait!

1431
01:48:22,805 --> 01:48:24,116
There are two lives in danger!

1432
01:48:24,474 --> 01:48:27,543
Who will save them?
You gotta save! Stay calm!

1433
01:48:29,471 --> 01:48:30,918
Hey! Petta my dear!

1434
01:48:32,388 --> 01:48:33,659
Run away?

1435
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,347
Go. Go.
Run Petta, run!

1436
01:48:36,745 --> 01:48:38,899
Wherever you run or
how long then ..

1437
01:48:38,899 --> 01:48:40,867
I will still kill you.

1438
01:48:41,068 --> 01:48:43,155
Go get him. Go!

1439
01:49:03,005 --> 01:49:03,992
Brother?

1440
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:09,202
What happen?
Why is this? Do not worry!

1441
01:49:09,778 --> 01:49:12,129
Nothing.
Slowly.

1442
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,793
Do not worry!

1443
01:49:14,973 --> 01:49:16,671
I will come back.

1444
01:49:17,015 --> 01:49:18,480
I'm coming ..

1445
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,387
Abang !!

1446
01:49:23,033 --> 01:49:25,657
My sister was sick to give birth!

1447
01:49:26,346 --> 01:49:27,548
Help him!

1448
01:49:29,355 --> 01:49:31,475
No need to worry, baby.
Have a good day.

1449
01:49:31,558 --> 01:49:34,262
Hold on dear affair!
Just a few more.

1450
01:49:38,015 --> 01:49:41,269
Brother, give something sharp,
I want to cut the umbilical cord.

1451
01:49:41,269 --> 01:49:43,789
You are blessed with a son.

1452
01:49:45,748 --> 01:49:49,528
Do not worry! It's safe.
Pull his head.

1453
01:49:51,058 --> 01:49:53,228
That's safe.
It was a smooth birth.

1454
01:49:55,474 --> 01:49:57,087
Here, take this kid!

1455
01:50:00,976 --> 01:50:05,100
Beautiful baby. He's like that
her mother or her dad?

1456
01:50:07,838 --> 01:50:11,376
Abang. Nephew
You're the one in a million!

1457
01:50:11,376 --> 01:50:12,703
Take care of her well.

1458
01:50:16,999 --> 01:50:18,534
Keep him comfortable.

1459
01:50:58,953 --> 01:51:01,590
He had to go by boat.
There is no way anymore!

1460
01:51:01,924 --> 01:51:04,895
It will take two or two
three weeks to get to Australia.

1461
01:51:41,923 --> 01:51:43,373
Abang!

1462
01:51:44,069 --> 01:51:46,106
Do not worry!
Nothing.

1463
01:51:51,758 --> 01:51:54,141
Do not cry dear!
Do not Cry!

1464
01:51:54,141 --> 01:51:56,231
My beloved son Malik.

1465
01:51:56,601 --> 01:51:58,466
I'm the cause
all of this!

1466
01:51:59,222 --> 01:52:01,390
All this time, all of you
live safely!

1467
01:52:01,797 --> 01:52:03,973
I'm coming here
from Australia because of love!

1468
01:52:03,998 --> 01:52:07,636
You can pick up more
problem in the name of love.

1469
01:52:08,216 --> 01:52:09,543
Your descendants
that's it!

1470
01:52:11,002 --> 01:52:12,345
That's not the problem!

1471
01:52:13,146 --> 01:52:14,123
Strife.

1472
01:52:14,944 --> 01:52:16,626
Still dispute!

1473
01:52:17,759 --> 01:52:20,012
My strife
refused to end because ..

1474
01:52:20,037 --> 01:52:21,995
I remember I can
live quietly.

1475
01:52:22,859 --> 01:52:26,601
This dispute catches up
we are ten years old!

1476
01:52:27,044 --> 01:52:29,026
I should end it
make it forever.

1477
01:52:30,374 --> 01:52:31,629
I'll end it!

1478
01:52:32,282 --> 01:52:33,522
I'm sure!

1479
01:52:34,083 --> 01:52:35,085
I'm sure ..!

1480
01:52:35,284 --> 01:52:36,173
Anwar!

1481
01:52:36,689 --> 01:52:38,903
Follow me.
We go visit!

1482
01:52:38,971 --> 01:52:40,098
Go to your uncle's house!

1483
01:52:40,367 --> 01:52:43,002
He started the game
this is after a while?

1484
01:52:44,425 --> 01:52:46,625
We have to play games
we in return, right?

1485
01:52:46,692 --> 01:52:48,747
Anwar! You will go
with my brother, Petta!

1486
01:52:48,811 --> 01:52:49,863
Be strong!

1487
01:52:50,052 --> 01:52:52,617
Go and stand in front
those who want our death!

1488
01:52:53,494 --> 01:52:56,390
Standing in front of them is
the first blow we gave!

1489
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:57,570
Poongodi!

1490
01:52:59,107 --> 01:53:00,443
I'm worried, Petta.

1491
01:53:00,522 --> 01:53:02,412
We can not afford it
losing anyone.

1492
01:53:02,524 --> 01:53:04,749
He is bigger than
which we suppose!

1493
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:08,897
Why we do not survive
hiding like always?

1494
01:53:09,604 --> 01:53:11,439
We are not hiding
all this while!

1495
01:53:13,123 --> 01:53:15,226
We just kneel,
waiting to grab!

1496
01:53:16,129 --> 01:53:18,002
It's time!

1497
01:53:18,133 --> 01:53:20,279
Time for Petta to attack!

1498
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:36,018
Sir sorry, sir.

1499
01:53:36,034 --> 01:53:38,358
Keep your sorry.
Who are they?

1500
01:53:38,358 --> 01:53:39,689
The Minister of Thangam, sir!

1501
01:53:39,689 --> 01:53:42,596
Rang Daayan Sena from
north who are asking for their services.

1502
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:46,096
They send Valentine's Day videos
and asked Anwar to be killed.

1503
01:53:47,210 --> 01:53:50,019
You all! Anwar and me
will be inserted into ICU.

1504
01:53:50,059 --> 01:53:51,950
Full security by police.
No one is allowed to enter.

1505
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:53,930
You also do not see us. Right?
- Right sir!

1506
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:56,865
Exam finish.
Everyone go back safely!

1507
01:53:57,391 --> 01:53:58,528
Your car?
- It's here.

1508
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,336
Lock!

1509
01:53:59,336 --> 01:54:00,933
Anwar! Follow me!

1510
01:54:01,148 --> 01:54:03,616
Tell your dad. I will
come home within an hour.

1511
01:54:03,721 --> 01:54:04,984
A good car.

1512
01:54:05,014 --> 01:54:08,264
 Five people who do not look like
rogue. And a little game.

1513
01:54:08,264 --> 01:54:09,098
Sir, game?

1514
01:54:09,098 --> 01:54:10,781
- Luckily.
- All this within an hour?

1515
01:54:10,781 --> 01:54:12,834
Five minutes have passed.
Where is the minister now?

1516
01:54:12,834 --> 01:54:14,623
Today is a wedding day
his daughter.

1517
01:54:14,623 --> 01:54:15,329
Anwar!

1518
01:54:15,486 --> 01:54:16,432
Come here!

1519
01:54:16,551 --> 01:54:18,083
We should not go
to eat a feast?

1520
01:54:18,108 --> 01:54:20,184
The last time I ate
with your dad! Sign in!

1521
01:54:28,254 --> 01:54:29,647
Hey! Let's go.

1522
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:33,130
Sir. It's fine! I do not want!
- Eat anything!

1523
01:54:44,578 --> 01:54:45,998
What do we do?

1524
01:54:47,263 --> 01:54:48,495
We will eat sweets!

1525
01:54:53,551 --> 01:54:55,246
<i> I've looked below.
Missing. </ I>

1526
01:54:55,246 --> 01:54:55,944
Aunt!

1527
01:54:56,116 --> 01:54:58,716
- Aunt's son-in-law talks.
- son-in-law?

1528
01:54:59,674 --> 01:55:02,018
<i> Not a pakkik. Bride
man is gone. </ i>

1529
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:03,420
Son-in-law?

1530
01:55:06,954 --> 01:55:09,531
Do not do anything for him.
I'm on my way.

1531
01:55:11,307 --> 01:55:12,212
Son-in-law!

1532
01:55:12,308 --> 01:55:14,411
Son-in-law! Who is
what do you like?

1533
01:55:14,525 --> 01:55:16,709
Who is he?

1534
01:55:17,281 --> 01:55:18,862
Hey! Who are you?

1535
01:55:21,632 --> 01:55:22,771
Son-in-law!

1536
01:55:24,071 --> 01:55:25,097
Son-in-law!

1537
01:55:25,847 --> 01:55:26,696
Son-in-law!

1538
01:55:26,769 --> 01:55:28,102
Who are you?

1539
01:55:28,308 --> 01:55:29,935
Hey Thangam?

1540
01:55:31,313 --> 01:55:33,142
Have you seen the video?

1541
01:55:33,182 --> 01:55:34,276
You do not remember?

1542
01:55:34,526 --> 01:55:36,716
The first youth
appeared was him!

1543
01:55:37,256 --> 01:55:39,297
I'm an old man who appears
at the end!

1544
01:55:39,322 --> 01:55:41,856
I made it because of people
Uttar Pradesh to tell!

1545
01:55:43,844 --> 01:55:45,489
Release him!

1546
01:55:45,489 --> 01:55:48,206
Thangam! You can not go on
marriage without life!

1547
01:55:48,206 --> 01:55:50,692
But without some of your fingers
can still continue marriage.

1548
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:54,653
I'll do what you tell me.
Please do not do anything for him.

1549
01:55:55,096 --> 01:55:57,096
Your friend from the north
will call you!

1550
01:55:57,121 --> 01:56:01,159
Tell him what
I told you!

1551
01:56:01,159 --> 01:56:03,495
And make him believe
for a few days!

1552
01:56:03,749 --> 01:56:05,592
It's something you are
always do!

1553
01:56:05,617 --> 01:56:08,445
I'll do as you say.

1554
01:56:08,445 --> 01:56:10,820
I'm more wicked
from what you think!

1555
01:56:27,913 --> 01:56:29,698
Now is not the time
to make love!

1556
01:56:29,723 --> 01:56:31,010
See when
Let's go back later.

1557
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:34,401
You will watch
something amazing!

1558
01:56:46,315 --> 01:56:48,782
Abang! Brother Petta Velan!

1559
01:56:48,793 --> 01:56:51,573
Forgive me!
Please forgive me! Get in!

1560
01:56:51,744 --> 01:56:53,777
You saved my son
and my people!

1561
01:56:53,824 --> 01:56:55,824
Please tell me
I forgive you.

1562
01:56:55,849 --> 01:56:58,456
This is not the time for all this!
You can apologize later.

1563
01:56:58,472 --> 01:56:59,521
Are you ready?

1564
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:01,569
They're ready!
That's it!

1565
01:57:01,569 --> 01:57:04,057
They are the best.
Among the best!

1566
01:57:04,117 --> 01:57:05,160
They are with me
for 15 years!

1567
01:57:05,185 --> 01:57:06,468
How are wives and children?

1568
01:57:06,493 --> 01:57:07,747
It does not exist.

1569
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:09,922
They are the best beaters!

1570
01:57:10,105 --> 01:57:12,105
Brother, there is one doubt!

1571
01:57:12,121 --> 01:57:13,662
You need to go that far
with this vehicle?

1572
01:57:13,687 --> 01:57:16,815
I can order tickets
first class flight for you.

1573
01:57:17,596 --> 01:57:19,422
Pack us
lunch time!

1574
01:57:19,431 --> 01:57:20,957
We will eat
and visit the Taj Mahal!

1575
01:57:20,982 --> 01:57:22,029
This is a war!

1576
01:57:22,323 --> 01:57:24,646
Enemy can not be impacted
the air we bleeded!

1577
01:57:25,844 --> 01:57:28,129
You should be trained
to fight!

1578
01:57:32,897 --> 01:57:35,031
- Mr. Sharma!
- Hello, brother Jithu!

1579
01:57:35,143 --> 01:57:36,626
This is Rahul we are looking for!

1580
01:57:36,873 --> 01:57:39,141
This is wrong! How
Can you be a policeman?

1581
01:57:39,141 --> 01:57:40,366
Anti India! Anti India!

1582
01:57:43,428 --> 01:57:46,008
Hospital in supervision
tight police!

1583
01:57:46,358 --> 01:57:48,852
They're both in ICU.

1584
01:57:48,877 --> 01:57:51,037
Be patient for 4 days, brother Jithu!

1585
01:57:51,213 --> 01:57:55,413
Once they get out of the hospital,
they will go straight to the mortuary!

1586
01:57:55,413 --> 01:57:56,709
That's my guarantee!

1587
01:57:59,187 --> 01:58:02,550
Dad, they're in the hospital.
We'll wait 4 more days!

1588
01:58:03,052 --> 01:58:04,647
Why are we waiting 4 days?

1589
01:58:05,956 --> 01:58:08,994
Father's health has been disturbed.
Why are not you there?

1590
01:58:08,994 --> 01:58:10,769
Party meeting two more days.

1591
01:58:10,883 --> 01:58:12,425
I need to be here right?

01:58:12,886 --> 01:58:14,779
Otherwise, dad will give
he's all a post!

1593
01:58:14,872 --> 01:58:17,501
Why you always want
party posts?

1594
01:58:17,693 --> 01:58:18,987
Dad will get it!

1595
01:58:19,984 --> 01:58:22,167
But, this needs to be done!

1596
01:58:22,198 --> 01:58:23,999
Dad, I'll kill them!

1597
01:58:24,039 --> 01:58:26,765
I can find them, will not
I can not kill them?

1598
01:58:26,765 --> 01:58:29,449
Do not worry! They are just
live up to next week only.

1599
01:58:29,479 --> 01:58:30,860
I'm a dad's son!

1600
01:58:30,885 --> 01:58:33,935
Like anti india, I plant
and destroy it in my place.

1601
01:58:33,935 --> 01:58:36,064
Dad sure.

1602
01:58:49,827 --> 01:58:53,088
Looks like I got to Tamil Nadu
to kill them!

1603
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:45,547
There is a set of weapons
in the vehicle.

1604
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:46,808
All the latest weapons.

1605
01:59:46,808 --> 01:59:47,876
Latest?

1606
01:59:48,456 --> 01:59:51,177
It will not work for them.
They will destroy us!

1607
01:59:51,177 --> 01:59:53,242
We have to get guns
the bigger one. We will buy.

1608
01:59:54,179 --> 01:59:56,607
You seem like that
have experience with him!

1609
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:07,432
Sir, it's great!

1610
02:00:48,699 --> 02:00:49,874
Best regards, Petta.

1611
02:01:08,385 --> 02:01:09,435
Petta.

1612
02:01:09,435 --> 02:01:10,585
Let them rest first.

1613
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:13,506
As soon as you're ready, we are
going to the store and going to town.

1614
02:01:13,998 --> 02:01:15,389
I wait on the ground floor.

1615
02:01:19,067 --> 02:01:20,067
Brother?

1616
02:01:20,401 --> 02:01:21,613
Who is that man?

1617
02:01:21,997 --> 02:01:25,324
Wherever you go in this world,
Surely anybody will help you?

1618
02:01:25,836 --> 02:01:27,256
He is the tamil.

1619
02:01:27,535 --> 02:01:28,739
Old friend.

1620
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:39,577
Are you a big person?

1621
02:01:39,577 --> 02:01:41,823
Yes, we can not touch him.

1622
02:01:41,838 --> 02:01:44,181
Politicians. Mafia.
Coal mining.

1623
02:01:44,205 --> 02:01:46,729
He's in the position
difference. Look at all this.

1624
02:01:46,729 --> 02:01:50,563
He is always surrounded by
20 or 30 armed guards.

1625
02:01:50,576 --> 02:01:53,508
The coward is so
afraid of his life threatened!

1626
02:02:00,431 --> 02:02:01,618
- Namaste, sir!
- Namaste.

1627
02:02:01,618 --> 02:02:02,727
I told you?

1628
02:02:02,727 --> 02:02:05,591
Yes, the new design has arrived.
Sign in and see.

1629
02:02:08,102 --> 02:02:09,995
These are all new designs.

1630
02:02:32,317 --> 02:02:34,833
<i> Our culture is in danger. </ i>

1631
02:02:34,833 --> 02:02:36,688
<i> As long as the Rang Daayan Sena party
powered .. </ i>

1632
02:02:36,688 --> 02:02:39,814
<i> We will not allow it
is valid. Awake! </ I>

1633
02:02:40,127 --> 02:02:43,272
He's the son of Singaram?
His man is a man.

1634
02:02:43,557 --> 02:02:45,659
She is the wife of Singaram's wife.

1635
02:02:48,183 --> 02:02:50,365
When Singaram comes to
here from Madurai ..

1636
02:02:50,436 --> 02:02:52,761
He married a man
widows, children of rich.

1637
02:02:53,479 --> 02:02:57,238
And take all the wealth,
position and concoctions.

1638
02:02:57,315 --> 02:02:59,902
He killed the rich man
and his daughter.

1639
02:02:59,902 --> 02:03:02,144
And lead the party
along with this young man.

1640
02:03:02,803 --> 02:03:04,842
He has another child,
his name is Jithu.

1641
02:03:04,867 --> 02:03:07,380
He's a strong man. Murder,
violence, what he did not do.

1642
02:03:07,405 --> 02:03:08,666
Great rake!

1643
02:03:08,691 --> 02:03:10,724
The tamil ruler who ruled
area in North India.

1644
02:03:10,724 --> 02:03:14,274
Tamil? Singaram ada
two wives?

1645
02:03:14,274 --> 02:03:17,232
There is a relationship
with a woman in Madurai.

1646
02:03:17,265 --> 02:03:19,116
Jithu was born
that woman.

1647
02:03:19,116 --> 02:03:23,008
He's dead. Take it
Jithu together when coming from Madurai.

1648
02:03:23,032 --> 02:03:24,306
Madurai ya?

1649
02:03:42,593 --> 02:03:45,185
<i> Singhaar Singh assassin!
Singhaar Singh is a killer! </ I>

1650
02:03:45,404 --> 02:03:50,797
<i> Singhaar Singh assassin!
Singhaar Singh is a killer! </ I>

1651
02:03:52,839 --> 02:03:55,908
I'm coming to Mr. Jithu.
I brought something from Tamilnadu.

1652
02:03:55,908 --> 02:03:57,289
No brother is there. Go away!

1653
02:03:57,289 --> 02:03:58,482
I want to see Mr. Jithu!

1654
02:03:58,678 --> 02:04:01,480
- There is something he wants from Tamilnadu.
- You want to meet Jithu?

1655
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:02,721
Yes, I want to see Mr. Jithu.

1656
02:04:04,565 --> 02:04:05,979
He wants to meet Jithu's brother!

1657
02:04:06,387 --> 02:04:07,450
Let him come in.

1658
02:04:15,374 --> 02:04:18,461
<i> Release me! Release! </ I>

1659
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:29,707
Can not call anymore?

1660
02:04:29,796 --> 02:04:30,850
Not yet, sir Petta.

1661
02:04:32,676 --> 02:04:33,934
There is an incoming call!

1662
02:04:34,732 --> 02:04:35,811
Silence ..!

1663
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:37,291
Plug the speaker.

1664
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:41,642
- Thangam?
- Hello, sir Jithu.

1665
02:04:42,412 --> 02:04:45,691
You said them both

1666
02:04:47,489 --> 02:04:48,838
- Cakaplah.
- Hey!

02:04:49,147 --> 02:04:51,132
Yes, sir Jithu.
That's the situation.

Someone here tell

1669
02:04:53,216 --> 02:04:55,258
And Anwar's video is with them.

1670

No way sir. Supporters
I'm watching them.

1671
02:04:59,112 --> 02:05:00,977
Hey! You're the minister.

1672
02:05:01,073 --> 02:05:02,073
Go look and check.

1673
02:05:02,138 --> 02:05:04,123
What are you doing with
your power? Go!

1674
02:05:04,282 --> 02:05:06,657
Give me 5 minutes.
I'll tell you later!

1675
02:05:27,361 --> 02:05:30,217
Brother Jithu! Brother Jithu!

02:05:35,464 --> 02:05:38,057
I was told they were

1678
02:05:38,203 --> 02:05:40,397
Nobody knows.

1679
02:05:40,397 --> 02:05:43,160
How do you become minister?
Dungu!

1680
02:05:43,436 --> 02:05:45,184
And I trust you too!

1681
02:05:45,416 --> 02:05:47,408
There is a rogue named
Ghanam where you are?

1682
02:05:47,799 --> 02:05:49,068
Yes, there is.

1683
02:05:50,055 --> 02:05:52,055
Is not he a problem with
that dormitory warden?

1684
02:05:52,095 --> 02:05:52,819
Yes there is ..

1685
02:05:52,844 --> 02:05:53,834
Hostel! Hostel!

1686
02:05:53,834 --> 02:05:57,357
It is related to the problem
contract boarding dormitory.

1687
02:05:57,382 --> 02:05:59,779
There are rumors
he killed the warden.

1688
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,653
My supporters say
the same thing.

1689
02:06:01,653 --> 02:06:03,154
Supporters ...

Thank you all! We are

1692
02:06:16,846 --> 02:06:19,448
When the dinner is ready,
we eat full.

1693
02:06:19,721 --> 02:06:21,537
And then,
we run our business.

1694
02:06:22,536 --> 02:06:24,160
Where am I going to take him?

1695
02:06:24,594 --> 02:06:26,572
Give price first!

1696
02:06:26,684 --> 02:06:28,846
- You tell me!
- 20 lakhs.

1697
02:06:28,846 --> 02:06:29,907
Where can I come from?

1698
02:06:30,090 --> 02:06:31,832
Singaram!

1699
02:06:35,502 --> 02:06:37,828
Petta has arrived!

1700
02:06:57,895 --> 02:06:59,359
Vehicle can not enter.

1701
02:06:59,384 --> 02:07:02,358
Parking is here.
We're walking. Come on.

1702
02:07:31,791 --> 02:07:33,672
She is coming. Be careful!

1703
02:07:38,607 --> 02:07:40,172
Hey! Give your weapon.

1704
02:07:42,265 --> 02:07:44,288
Get it out!

1705
02:07:46,538 --> 02:07:48,094
Are you all weapons right?

1706
02:07:48,119 --> 02:07:49,587
How much if you kill me?

1707
02:07:51,502 --> 02:07:53,091
I need one for
my salvation.

1708
02:07:54,141 --> 02:07:56,029
You have to trust us!
There is no other way.

1709
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:57,333
Weapons.

1710
02:07:58,145 --> 02:07:59,470
Take it out.

1711
02:08:06,713 --> 02:08:07,829
Go.

1712
02:08:17,498 --> 02:08:18,585
Give it.

1713
02:08:21,935 --> 02:08:24,347
- Open it.
- Wait. We'll think about it first.

1714
02:08:28,084 --> 02:08:29,196
It's all enough.

1715
02:08:34,769 --> 02:08:36,803
Go. Take him and go.

1716
02:08:36,828 --> 02:08:37,844
What do you want to do?

1717
02:08:38,813 --> 02:08:40,309
Enter him to school?

1718
02:08:45,111 --> 02:08:46,229
Anwar!

1719
02:08:46,573 --> 02:08:47,786
How are you?

1720
02:08:54,439 --> 02:08:56,742
PETTA !!!

1721
02:09:13,127 --> 02:09:14,209
Great!

1722
02:09:18,144 --> 02:09:19,180
Pity ..

1723
02:09:19,205 --> 02:09:22,815
The roaring tiger trapped
like a feared mouse.

1724
02:09:28,413 --> 02:09:29,559
Have no cigarettes?

1725
02:09:47,238 --> 02:09:48,750
Not good for health.

1726
02:09:49,247 --> 02:09:50,827
I say based on
experience.

1727
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:59,236
My father was looking for you
for 20 years.

1728
02:09:59,537 --> 02:10:00,878
It's worth it!

1729
02:10:01,768 --> 02:10:02,707
Obviously.

1730
02:10:03,633 --> 02:10:06,917
Brother, please tell my dad
he's the one we've caught him?

1731
02:10:06,917 --> 02:10:08,049
What is it?

1732
02:10:08,633 --> 02:10:11,492
The plan is to arrest
my dad and make me bait?

1733
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:13,500
It will not succeed. Bad ..

1734
02:10:13,589 --> 02:10:16,674
How much if we kill you
and tell him? Will it succeed?

1735
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:20,881
Her eyes look ..

1736
02:10:21,581 --> 02:10:23,357
He did not come here alone.

1737
02:10:26,078 --> 02:10:27,581
A leader is supposed to be so!

1738
02:10:27,721 --> 02:10:29,381
Look out for yourself.

1739
02:10:29,431 --> 02:10:30,425
Sir!

1740
02:10:40,684 --> 02:10:42,320
What do you think, Petta?

1741
02:10:42,393 --> 02:10:44,807
Which I will believe in words
Minister and come alone!

1742
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:46,412
I'm stupid?

1743
02:10:46,412 --> 02:10:47,656
They've been to us!

1744
02:10:49,101 --> 02:10:50,732
Nobody can run from here.

1745
02:10:50,749 --> 02:10:52,208
If I did not kill you
and boy ..

1746
02:10:52,372 --> 02:10:54,372
If I did not kill you
and boy there ..

1747
02:10:54,397 --> 02:10:55,939
..and take your body
to my dad ..

1748
02:10:56,895 --> 02:10:58,181
So I'm not the son of Singaram.

1749
02:10:58,206 --> 02:10:59,768
Abang! Kill him here!

1750
02:10:59,768 --> 02:11:01,771
If we kill him, we do not
can get out of here.

1751
02:11:02,184 --> 02:11:05,347
This genius is our savior!

1752
02:11:18,847 --> 02:11:22,103
Have your men stop firing.
If not I will fire you.

1753
02:11:24,253 --> 02:11:25,167
Speak!

1754
02:11:26,501 --> 02:11:28,144
Hey! Do not shoot!

1755
02:11:28,524 --> 02:11:30,170
Release them. Hey!

1756
02:11:36,382 --> 02:11:37,825
Hello Friend!

1757
02:11:45,146 --> 02:11:46,500
Release me!

1758
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:08,481
Look at it.

1759
02:12:20,044 --> 02:12:21,465
Come here! Come here!

1760
02:12:21,465 --> 02:12:22,905
Come on!

1761
02:12:22,905 --> 02:12:25,277

Do not be scared.

1765
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:44,884
There's nothing going on.

1766
02:13:40,497 --> 02:13:42,568
Use me for
my father's trap?

1767
02:13:42,777 --> 02:13:44,234
And in our own place?

1768
02:13:44,278 --> 02:13:45,293
Great!

1769
02:13:45,382 --> 02:13:47,272
I can continue to kill him!

1770
02:13:47,463 --> 02:13:48,735
But not him I tell you.

1771
02:13:48,806 --> 02:13:50,313
Put your weapon
and I'll let go of him!

1772
02:13:50,476 --> 02:13:51,613
How much is Anwar?

1773
02:13:52,947 --> 02:13:53,959
Promise!

1774
02:13:59,757 --> 02:14:00,807
You go!

1775
02:14:03,854 --> 02:14:05,187
How much is Petta?

1776
02:14:05,473 --> 02:14:08,823
You expect justice
in this war?

1777
02:14:40,749 --> 02:14:42,674
Come here!

1778
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:44,365
Come here! Come here!

1779
02:14:44,631 --> 02:14:45,665
Thank you!

1780
02:14:54,883 --> 02:14:57,091
Come on! Come on! Sign in!

1781
02:14:58,393 --> 02:14:59,968
Fast! Fast! let's go!

1782
02:15:04,513 --> 02:15:05,703
Chetta!

1783
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:08,639
Do not be scared. He will be healed.

1784
02:15:09,283 --> 02:15:10,847
You can kill him earlier.

1785
02:15:12,286 --> 02:15:13,756
Why did not you kill her?

1786
02:15:33,219 --> 02:15:34,822
Hello Jithu!

1787
02:15:35,594 --> 02:15:37,421
Jithu! Where are you?

1788
02:15:37,445 --> 02:15:40,118
I tried to contact you!
Why are you injured?

1789
02:15:41,662 --> 02:15:42,923
What is this festival for?

1790
02:15:42,948 --> 02:15:45,068
Arijith got tickets to contest.
We can not do anything.

1791
02:15:53,982 --> 02:15:55,272
Congratulations to all of you.

1792
02:15:55,272 --> 02:15:57,444
People have chosen you
as their representative.

1793
02:15:57,444 --> 02:15:59,360
But it's your duty ..

1794
02:15:59,428 --> 02:16:00,756
Listen.

1795
02:16:03,695 --> 02:16:04,730
Instant.

1796
02:16:11,304 --> 02:16:13,724
I have tried my best
to get you a post ..

1797
02:16:14,121 --> 02:16:15,227
This time..

1798
02:16:16,082 --> 02:16:18,148
But the party did
Arijith's decision ..

1799
02:16:18,473 --> 02:16:20,101
Petta and Anwar are here.

1800
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:21,437
In our place.

1801
02:16:22,495 --> 02:16:23,732
Petta?

1802
02:16:25,710 --> 02:16:28,376
- Here?
- They're trying to trap me.

1803
02:16:28,913 --> 02:16:30,415
Its design, use
I'm a bait.

1804
02:16:30,495 --> 02:16:32,131
But I attacked.

1805
02:16:32,251 --> 02:16:33,512
I should have killed them.

1806
02:16:33,746 --> 02:16:34,725
It's just a slight one.

1807
02:16:34,781 --> 02:16:36,958
He missed! Dungu!

1808
02:16:37,486 --> 02:16:39,540
Daddy said no
look low at him.

1809
02:16:39,998 --> 02:16:42,296
You're cool talking to him
at the hospital!

1810
02:16:42,419 --> 02:16:44,245
Now, he's planning to kill dad!

1811
02:16:44,270 --> 02:16:45,636
And you let her miss!

1812
02:16:45,876 --> 02:16:46,661
Dungu!

1813
02:16:48,169 --> 02:16:49,609
He's almost dead, dad.

1814
02:16:49,961 --> 02:16:51,238
Almost-before.

1815
02:16:51,501 --> 02:16:53,855
I'll catch him tonight!

1816
02:16:54,115 --> 02:16:55,849
He's not an ordinary person.

1817
02:16:56,212 --> 02:16:57,920
He will do anything.

1818
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:00,457
Get him today too!

1819
02:17:00,814 --> 02:17:03,679
Take him and take him
to dad!

1820
02:17:03,882 --> 02:17:06,501
With his own father's hands,
father ..

1821
02:17:08,018 --> 02:17:11,113
Petta!
Petta Velan!

1822
02:17:22,047 --> 02:17:23,562
Car parking on the edges.

1823
02:17:29,068 --> 02:17:30,381
Brother Jithu, momentarily.

1824
02:17:32,105 --> 02:17:33,880
Why are you fighting?
without reason?

1825
02:18:31,057 --> 02:18:33,513
I can kill you
while there.

1826
02:18:34,022 --> 02:18:35,712
I just want to talk to you.

1827
02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:41,600
No weapons needed.
I will not do anything.

1828
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:43,852
I just want to talk
with you for a moment.

1829
02:18:45,048 --> 02:18:46,254
What about?

1830
02:18:47,297 --> 02:18:49,281
Have you ever been
look at your mom?

1831
02:18:52,699 --> 02:18:53,668
What do you want?

1832
02:18:53,693 --> 02:18:55,580
Have you ever seen your mom?

1833
02:18:55,873 --> 02:18:57,479
No, he died after
gave birth to me.

1834
02:18:57,949 --> 02:18:59,449
Why did you ask me a question?

1835
02:19:02,984 --> 02:19:05,411
I'm the one who drives Singaram.

1836
02:19:06,649 --> 02:19:08,775
He left Madurai alone.

1837
02:19:10,452 --> 02:19:15,083
He has no wife or children,
as it claimed.

1838
02:19:15,252 --> 02:19:16,284
What?

1839
02:19:16,888 --> 02:19:18,193
What are you saying?

1840
02:19:19,945 --> 02:19:21,058
Sit down.

1841
02:19:43,055 --> 02:19:44,243
You're my son.

1842
02:19:44,804 --> 02:19:48,710
The kid I suppose,
already dead.

1843
02:19:50,815 --> 02:19:54,250
When I see you today,
for the first time ..

1844
02:19:54,250 --> 02:19:56,013
I feel something in me.

1845
02:19:56,276 --> 02:20:00,370
When I see you, I feel like
look at my familiar face.

1846
02:20:01,322 --> 02:20:03,029
You remind me of my wife, Saro!

1847
02:20:03,029 --> 02:20:04,179
And when I see it ..

1848
02:20:04,299 --> 02:20:06,462
..they burn on your body.

1849
02:20:07,043 --> 02:20:08,222
I feel very sure!

1850
02:20:09,019 --> 02:20:10,281
You are my son.

1851
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:13,812
Chinna me!

1852
02:20:14,287 --> 02:20:15,327
What?

1853
02:20:15,977 --> 02:20:17,203
Burned?

1854
02:20:17,728 --> 02:20:20,802
My dad said he was caused
by the firecrackers while I was small.

1855
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:25,244
It is grated from
Place your bomb!

1856
02:20:25,631 --> 02:20:29,144
Grate from the bomb
killed Malik and Saro me!

1857
02:20:29,635 --> 02:20:33,651
I still remember.
You burned because of the explosion.

1858
02:20:33,758 --> 02:20:35,515
I thought you were dead.

1859
02:20:36,215 --> 02:20:38,203
I ran to save Poongodi.

1860
02:20:38,263 --> 02:20:41,149
And of course Singaram bring it
you're from there.

1861
02:20:41,281 --> 02:20:43,966
And he has raised you all this time.

1862
02:20:44,228 --> 02:20:46,238
To make you kill me.

1863
02:20:46,238 --> 02:20:48,126
But he does not care about you
kind of own child ..

1864
02:20:48,151 --> 02:20:49,969
..and do not overdo you
with love.

1865
02:20:49,969 --> 02:20:52,757
You're just a tool for revenge.

1866
02:20:53,009 --> 02:20:54,407
You are my son!

1867
02:20:54,958 --> 02:20:56,358
Chinna me!

1868
02:20:58,636 --> 02:20:59,912
No.

1869
02:21:00,884 --> 02:21:02,219
Impossible.

1870
02:21:08,614 --> 02:21:10,812
Go and ask him this question!

1871
02:21:11,250 --> 02:21:13,329
He will panic!
He'll say I'm cheating.

1872
02:21:13,488 --> 02:21:15,823
Look at her eyes.
You will know the truth.

1873
02:21:17,859 --> 02:21:19,915
I'll be in the bazaar,
Jalan Dharmasala.

1874
02:21:20,632 --> 02:21:22,746
Whether you come as Jithu ..

1875
02:21:23,412 --> 02:21:24,889
..or you come as Chinna!

1876
02:21:24,889 --> 02:21:26,979
I'll still be waiting for you!

1877
02:21:27,288 --> 02:21:28,379
See you again.

1878
02:21:36,571 --> 02:21:38,112
Jithu! Where are you?

1879
02:21:57,528 --> 02:21:59,148
Tell me you arrested him, Jithu.

1880
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:06,758
Why is this?

1881
02:22:10,191 --> 02:22:11,455
Is he arrested?

1882
02:22:13,242 --> 02:22:14,716
Talk yes!

1883
02:22:15,165 --> 02:22:16,653
Am I the Petta boy?

1884
02:22:21,727 --> 02:22:23,350
Anak Petta ..!

1885
02:22:26,386 --> 02:22:28,870
Is my dad up over me?
just to get revenge?

1886
02:22:46,034 --> 02:22:47,878
Dad always served
I am like a gangster!

1887
02:22:48,386 --> 02:22:49,805
Everything is only for Arijith!

1888
02:22:50,381 --> 02:22:51,928
Dad always set me aside ..

1889
02:22:52,242 --> 02:22:53,424
Like a dog ..

1890
02:22:54,258 --> 02:22:55,699
Jithu ..!

1891
02:22:56,531 --> 02:22:57,858
Why with you?

1892
02:22:58,031 --> 02:23:00,013
Speak like crazy!

1893
02:23:10,110 --> 02:23:11,988
How much can I get?
burn this grate?

1894
02:23:16,644 --> 02:23:17,905
Why are you talking about this?

1895
02:23:18,629 --> 02:23:19,930
Like a fool?

1896
02:23:24,825 --> 02:23:27,285
What happened suddenly?

1897
02:23:29,214 --> 02:23:30,866
You see Petta again?

1898
02:23:34,933 --> 02:23:37,017
Why are you asking, I'm there
see Petta again?

1899
02:23:38,286 --> 02:23:39,945
So, is that true?

1900
02:23:41,510 --> 02:23:42,684
Tell your father!

1901
02:23:43,011 --> 02:23:44,344
You see him again?

1902
02:23:45,086 --> 02:23:46,707
Cakaplah! I'm a daddy?

1903
02:23:49,018 --> 02:23:50,830
Do not worry!

1904
02:23:50,918 --> 02:23:52,705
He must come when
he knows the truth.

1905
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:55,056
We'll be back home
with my uncle.

1906
02:23:59,811 --> 02:24:01,700
You've killed her son.

1907
02:24:02,444 --> 02:24:05,178
His son. His wife. Malik!

1908
02:24:05,666 --> 02:24:06,737
Everyone.

1909
02:24:08,619 --> 02:24:09,982
You killed them!

1910
02:24:11,871 --> 02:24:13,331
Drink.

1911
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:15,135
You are disturbed.

1912
02:24:15,296 --> 02:24:17,914
Position in the party,
Petta escaped ..

1913
02:24:18,244 --> 02:24:20,141
All this bother you!

1914
02:24:20,141 --> 02:24:21,775
Drink and sleep!

1915
02:24:22,074 --> 02:24:24,074
Let Dad handle him!

1916
02:24:35,533 --> 02:24:37,804
If Singaram knows that
Chinna already knows the real thing ..

1917
02:24:38,107 --> 02:24:40,107
Will he stay silent?

1918
02:24:40,236 --> 02:24:42,534
How much would he have to deal with Chinna?

1919
02:24:53,202 --> 02:24:55,080
Oh, brother of Jithu!

1920
02:24:55,697 --> 02:24:58,360
Mr. Singhaa called
you go up.

1921
02:24:58,384 --> 02:25:01,677
Arijith's brother got it
tickets to MLA.

1922
02:25:31,771 --> 02:25:33,262
Abang! He's there.

1923
02:25:34,977 --> 02:25:36,254
Hey! Get up!

1924
02:25:37,429 --> 02:25:38,610
Get up!

1925
02:25:44,028 --> 02:25:45,764
You came to get stolen?

1926
02:25:46,530 --> 02:25:48,274
You want to kill a cow ..

1927
02:25:48,366 --> 02:25:50,552
..and you want to sell the meat.

1928
02:25:50,862 --> 02:25:52,119
Beef?

1929
02:25:54,046 --> 02:25:56,435
- You know who I am?
- Who are you?

1930
02:25:56,467 --> 02:25:57,905
We are from the same party!

1931
02:25:58,694 --> 02:26:00,733
I am the son of Singaram!

1932
02:26:00,829 --> 02:26:02,539
This is our cage!

1933
02:27:29,054 --> 02:27:31,331
Who are you?
Who send you

1934
02:27:31,355 --> 02:27:32,351
Sorry. Sorry.

1935
02:27:32,362 --> 02:27:34,990
Singhaar! Mr. Singhaar!

1936
02:27:43,639 --> 02:27:45,107
Brackets everyone.

1937
02:27:47,078 --> 02:27:49,672
Singaram can not tell who
Chinna missed and was alive.

1938
02:28:08,806 --> 02:28:10,234
Singaram!

1939
02:28:12,617 --> 02:28:13,912
Let's go, Chinna!

1940
02:28:17,608 --> 02:28:18,774
Dad!

1941
02:28:21,487 --> 02:28:22,487
Dad!

1942
02:28:42,357 --> 02:28:45,703
Singaram must send him
looking for you, without anyone's knowledge.

1943
02:28:45,703 --> 02:28:47,333
There seems to be no one
who knows this.

1944
02:28:47,452 --> 02:28:49,158
Everyone is busy
look for Petta!

1945
02:28:49,710 --> 02:28:53,184
Tell them, me and my people
have run away and turned their attention.

1946
02:28:53,770 --> 02:28:56,333
We can go home
Singaram and kill him.

1947
02:28:56,510 --> 02:28:58,612
The house will be surrounded
by 30 or 40 people!

1948
02:28:59,625 --> 02:29:01,625
If I have more time,
I can get more people!

1949
02:29:01,650 --> 02:29:03,940
We're late
for 20 years, Chinna!

1950
02:29:03,973 --> 02:29:05,821
We can not wait anymore!

1951
02:29:05,846 --> 02:29:08,103
If we make a decision to
attacking, it must be done now!

1952
02:29:08,110 --> 02:29:09,452
No need to talk much.

1953
02:29:22,362 --> 02:29:23,517
Let's go!

1954
02:29:23,597 --> 02:29:25,073
We go kill him!

1955
02:30:09,539 --> 02:30:10,508
Mr. Singhaa.

1956
02:30:10,635 --> 02:30:13,021
I started to take medicine.

1957
02:30:13,108 --> 02:30:15,568
Do not feel depressed.
Relax tonight!

1958
02:30:15,614 --> 02:30:19,034
Do not burden yourself!
Go to sleep.

1959
02:30:19,034 --> 02:30:20,685
I can not sleep tonight!

1960
02:30:22,333 --> 02:30:23,962
Mahashivarathri!

1961
02:31:00,696 --> 02:31:01,838
Chinna!

1962
02:31:02,894 --> 02:31:04,719
For those who have gone!

1963
02:31:04,801 --> 02:31:06,691
And for our sake
which has been lost.

1964
02:31:56,974 --> 02:31:58,704
Sikandar! Come here!

1965
02:32:00,141 --> 02:32:01,696
Store in a closet.
- Okay, sir.

1966
02:32:14,041 --> 02:32:14,970
You're torn here!

1967
02:32:15,033 --> 02:32:16,736
Come on as soon as I order!

1968
02:32:20,251 --> 02:32:21,718
Get up!

1969
02:32:21,766 --> 02:32:23,012
Get up!

1970
02:32:24,663 --> 02:32:26,027
Eat sweets.

1971
02:32:26,991 --> 02:32:28,816
Eat.

1972
02:32:35,851 --> 02:32:37,141
Please smile!

1973
02:32:37,423 --> 02:32:39,486
I give it with love
Dear. Smile!

1974
02:33:33,650 --> 02:33:36,368
Be a traitor.
You're dead!

1975
02:34:54,218 --> 02:34:56,414
Jithu! You? Die!

1976
02:35:12,888 --> 02:35:14,276
You killed him!

1977
02:35:17,295 --> 02:35:18,643
Jithu !?

1978
02:35:43,771 --> 02:35:45,016
Anwar!

1979
02:36:05,344 --> 02:36:07,066
Singaram!

1980
02:36:09,393 --> 02:36:12,547
Petta is up !!

1981
02:36:35,276 --> 02:36:36,956
Singaram!

1982
02:36:40,233 --> 02:36:41,811
"Budak" Singaram!

1983
02:36:42,352 --> 02:36:44,161
How long then?

1984
02:36:44,773 --> 02:36:45,860
What's your name, Singaram?

1985
02:36:46,138 --> 02:36:47,608
What are all these tubes and wires?

1986
02:36:47,904 --> 02:36:48,719
Petta?

1987
02:36:48,874 --> 02:36:50,317
Yes! Petta!

1988
02:36:50,342 --> 02:36:52,139
Petta Velan!

1989
02:36:54,538 --> 02:36:55,346
Jithu?

1990
02:36:55,369 --> 02:36:56,786
Not Jithu!

1991
02:36:57,295 --> 02:36:59,361
My son, Chinna!

1992
02:37:00,750 --> 02:37:01,726
Anwar!

1993
02:37:01,814 --> 02:37:03,392
Your nephew.

1994
02:37:03,570 --> 02:37:05,570
Son of Malik, Anwar!

1995
02:37:10,413 --> 02:37:11,952
Clash of 20 years.

1996
02:37:16,262 --> 02:37:18,262
You managed to get revenge eventually!

1997
02:37:18,286 --> 02:37:21,396
Before death, Malik
look into my eyes!

1998
02:37:21,985 --> 02:37:24,851
And I see who he is
trust me completely!

1999
02:37:24,851 --> 02:37:28,150
He believed that I would take care
his family after his death!

2000
02:37:28,276 --> 02:37:29,818
All this for that!

2001
02:37:30,088 --> 02:37:30,906
Hey!

2002
02:37:31,225 --> 02:37:32,543
Not only you!

2003
02:37:32,814 --> 02:37:36,302
If anyone tries anything
this family, no matter who he is!

2004
02:37:36,416 --> 02:37:38,167
Although he was inside
great fortress!

2005
02:37:38,192 --> 02:37:40,810
This petta will crumble
get in and stand in front of him!

2006
02:37:40,810 --> 02:37:42,343
And protect them
from evil!

2007
02:37:42,668 --> 02:37:44,083
And eliminate the evil!

2008
02:37:45,202 --> 02:37:46,313
Kill it.

2009
02:37:50,341 --> 02:37:51,573
I've been defeated.

2010
02:37:53,284 --> 02:37:54,204
Finish all this!

2011
02:37:54,204 --> 02:37:56,093
Yes. In two minutes.

2012
02:37:56,104 --> 02:37:58,918
I want to sit down, relax
while looking at your death!

2013
02:37:59,648 --> 02:38:00,941
But before that ..

2014
02:38:01,140 --> 02:38:03,141
Your nephew is a gift.

2015
02:38:03,237 --> 02:38:04,294
Anwar!

2016
02:38:04,421 --> 02:38:05,477
Give it to her.

2017
02:38:05,993 --> 02:38:08,384
Go. He's your uncle!

2018
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:16,581
A gift that my uncle gave me.

2019
02:38:16,607 --> 02:38:19,284
The nephews give it
First, remember not?

2020
02:38:26,428 --> 02:38:28,077
This is for my dad, Malik.

2021
02:38:37,833 --> 02:38:39,300
This is for my mom, Saro!

2022
02:38:55,199 --> 02:38:56,333
Great game!

2023
02:38:57,382 --> 02:38:59,318
Great game!

2024
02:39:07,809 --> 02:39:10,509
Yes, great! It's great!

2025
02:39:11,147 --> 02:39:14,147
You expect more than
Singhaar Singh?

2026
02:39:14,430 --> 02:39:16,430
Singaram. Singaram!

2027
02:39:16,455 --> 02:39:17,891
Shanmugam!
- Yes!

2028
02:39:18,790 --> 02:39:19,925
Cakaplah.

2029
02:39:20,068 --> 02:39:22,248
These boys do not have to
look at all this. Take them away.

2030
02:39:22,248 --> 02:39:24,945
Let's go. Let's go down.
Mari Anwar. Come on!

2031
02:39:26,133 --> 02:39:27,315
Go Chinna.

2032
02:39:29,222 --> 02:39:30,249
Kareem!

2033
02:39:30,249 --> 02:39:31,636
Pull the sofa here.

2034
02:39:38,745 --> 02:39:39,793
I want to ask ..

2035
02:39:40,262 --> 02:39:44,250
You remember me hiding from you
all this time for fear of you?

2036
02:39:45,059 --> 02:39:47,250
I let you live
all this time because of pity!

2037
02:39:50,144 --> 02:39:53,773
Are all these results from influencing
and steal from others?

2038
02:39:54,014 --> 02:39:57,514
You can keep on living
the same way to death?

2039
02:39:57,539 --> 02:39:58,628
But no!

2040
02:39:59,374 --> 02:40:00,940
Your sin will not
go leave you!

2041
02:40:05,055 --> 02:40:06,808
You made a mistake, Singaram!

2042
02:40:07,118 --> 02:40:08,427
Big mistake!

2043
02:40:09,587 --> 02:40:11,777
You should not
"touch" us again!

2044
02:40:12,169 --> 02:40:13,345
But you do it too.

2045
02:40:13,879 --> 02:40:16,491
And I never forgive
people who do that!

2046
02:40:18,803 --> 02:40:20,310
Can we start?

2047
02:40:21,788 --> 02:40:24,531
Hey! Take it.
Take that sucker.

2048
02:40:26,182 --> 02:40:27,240
Fast. Fast!

2049
02:40:27,854 --> 02:40:28,917
Fast. Fast..

2050
02:40:34,686 --> 02:40:39,647
This is the fate of the person who stole
from the land and my hometown!

2051
02:41:57,405 --> 02:41:58,542
Chinna!

2052
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:01,169
Let me tell you a story!

2053
02:42:01,664 --> 02:42:03,376
You know Vaali? Vaali?

2054
02:42:03,382 --> 02:42:05,207
Vaali from Ramayana.

2055
02:42:05,247 --> 02:42:06,303
The courageous officer!

2056
02:42:06,367 --> 02:42:08,358
Unforgivable fighters.
But evil!

2057
02:42:08,686 --> 02:42:10,441
She kidnapped her own wife.

2058
02:42:10,784 --> 02:42:12,950
No one
can destroy him because ..

2059
02:42:13,032 --> 02:42:14,747
He has unique power.

2060
02:42:15,169 --> 02:42:15,994
Rahmat.

2061
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:18,557
When enemies oppose it
face to face,

2062
02:42:18,582 --> 02:42:20,609
..he will take half
from their power.

2063
02:42:20,730 --> 02:42:22,962
And that's why, Sri Ramar ..

2064
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:24,655
Hiding in
behind the tree and ..

2065
02:42:24,680 --> 02:42:26,126
..shoot of arrows
to kill him.

2066
02:42:26,279 --> 02:42:27,508
Cunning!

2067
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:31,894
If we are on the right side
and our enemies ..

2068
02:42:32,331 --> 02:42:36,346
..they are evil and strong, so kill him
with cunning is not a mistake.

2069
02:42:36,358 --> 02:42:37,514
Speak Sri Ramar!

2070
02:42:37,606 --> 02:42:39,068
The authorities.

2071
02:42:39,084 --> 02:42:41,201
While he also killed
with cunning ..

2072
02:42:41,511 --> 02:42:43,098
..this I'm just ordinary human!

2073
02:42:43,312 --> 02:42:44,609
Do you understand?

2074
02:42:45,483 --> 02:42:46,617
You do not understand right?

2075
02:43:02,189 --> 02:43:03,086
Sit down.

2076
02:43:03,355 --> 02:43:05,085
Sit down ..!

2077
02:43:11,472 --> 02:43:13,582
You are not my son, Chinna.

2078
02:43:20,749 --> 02:43:22,344
The bombs laid by Singaram ..

2079
02:43:22,653 --> 02:43:25,506
..that killing a kid
I'm in front of my own eyes!

2080
02:43:25,506 --> 02:43:27,371
I'm lying about you thats my kid.

2081
02:43:27,482 --> 02:43:30,484
I'm lying about my father
You sent someone to kill you!

2082
02:43:30,484 --> 02:43:32,631
It's all part
from my design!

2083
02:43:32,631 --> 02:43:35,176
You are the son of Singaram!

2084
02:43:35,276 --> 02:43:36,693
Sure ..

2085
02:43:37,291 --> 02:43:39,466
He's good at acting!

2086
02:43:40,101 --> 02:43:43,625
I broke into the fort and
Kill your people, with the help of you.

2087
02:43:43,625 --> 02:43:46,539
Kill my main enemy
and revenge for losing me!

2088
02:43:46,596 --> 02:43:49,293
One solid shot!
A solid shot from me!

2089
02:43:50,767 --> 02:43:52,363
Now what do I want to do with you?

2090
02:43:52,363 --> 02:43:53,620
You are good.

2091
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:54,724
You helped me a lot.

2092
02:43:54,796 --> 02:43:56,814
So I want to let you
live or not?

2093
02:43:56,839 --> 02:43:58,839
But you're her son! You
may be in vain.

2094
02:43:58,864 --> 02:44:00,969
One day you will probably
against me!

2095
02:44:00,969 --> 02:44:02,975
So will I be
kill you now?

2096
02:44:03,621 --> 02:44:04,700
Do I have to let you go?

2097
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:05,979
Or do I have to kill you?

2098
02:44:07,951 --> 02:44:10,085
I want to kill
or release him?

2099
02:44:13,755 --> 02:44:15,908
When I was young ..

2100
02:44:15,932 --> 02:44:17,640
There are priests in our village ..

2101
02:44:18,127 --> 02:44:19,372
He always said something!

2102
02:44:19,404 --> 02:44:22,358
Do not make the current decision
being angry or confused!

2103
02:44:22,742 --> 02:44:25,761
Dance with the song
most liked!

2104
02:44:25,848 --> 02:44:28,782
And then do what
which is said by the heart.

2105
02:44:32,517 --> 02:44:34,049
Play our song!

2106
02:45:57,902 --> 02:46:00,783
Is this game
is enough, my son?
