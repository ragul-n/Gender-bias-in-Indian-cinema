1
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,150
Shhh...!

2
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,524
We should tell you a story today.

3
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:49,983
A story filled with revenge and vengeance.

4
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,733
A revenge that's hunting us since ages.

5
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,983
That's the first murder spot we have
planned to take out our enemy...

6
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:04,524
Last ten minutes!

7
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,983
Hey...

8
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,608
-Just 2 minutes...
-Hey!

9
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,317
I have a slip to write from.

10
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,317
Who's that?

11
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,691
Chowdary, give me the bag.

12
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,233
Looks good? Is it Ok?

13
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,233
Tuck the shirt in.

14
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:26,150
No, it doesn't look good. Remove it...

15
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,400
Did you write any poem?

16
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,108
Then what will you tell her?

17
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,441
-I love you!
-Just that?

18
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:43,650
It's Ok. Go on...

19
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,233
Take this rose.

20
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,983
What's up?

21
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:55,816
Listening to FM.

22
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:10,067
BF?

23
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:12,775
-The balance will get deducted, idiot.
-Are you the one who pays?

24
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:34,900
[indistinct chatter]

25
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,816
What's Raju doing here?

26
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,275
Hey!

27
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:28,733
Come on...

28
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,192
Go...

29
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:38,858
Tell her...

30
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,067
-You...
-She's going away.

31
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:51,067
Stop her.

32
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:53,483
[both]: Rani...

33
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:09,983
You idiots... Stop!

34
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:12,150
First attempt was a failure.

35
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:14,067
We planned the second, the very next day.

36
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,775
Both shirt and pants are Ok...

37
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:24,566
Even the underwear is Ok.
It's you what's not Ok.

38
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,650
We are done with the exams.

39
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,317
If you let her go this time... You can
do nothing about it ever again. Got it?

40
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,275
Take this.

41
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:33,858
-What will you say?
-I love you!

42
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,233
-What will you say?
-I love you!

43
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:36,441
-What will you say?
-I love--

44
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,816
-Go tell her that.
-Ok.

45
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,275
[inaudible]

46
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,566
-Her father is there with her.
-[both]: Is it?

47
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,524
As if it's the only reason...

48
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,733
Shut up! It's not that
easy to propose a girl.

49
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:36,942
You shut up first.

50
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,025
Give that.

51
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,483
I would have shown you how it's
done, if I had a girl.

52
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:44,275
Is it? What kind of girl do you want, sir?

53
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,775
No specifications.
Being a girl is the only one.

54
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,025
-Then take a look at this.
-No!

55
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,983
Stop! Stop! Stop, Cheta!

56
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,400
It's not Cheta (dust pan).
It's Swetha.

57
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:58,733
Yeah, right. Chowdary wants to
tell you something. Let me get him.

58
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,650
-Come on.
-Leave me alone!

59
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,983
-Come on. Let's go.
-No!

60
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,483
-Go.
-I shouldn't propose to her.

61
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:11,233
Come on.

62
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:15,900
Tell her. Go on.

63
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,400
-I shouldn't propose to her.
-Go on...

64
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,691
What?

65
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,858
-I--
-I love you?

66
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,192
-Yes.
-Get lost.

67
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,816
Sorry, brother. I don't like all these.

68
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:36,150
Because I like Raja.

69
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,608
I promise,
they both forced me to propose you.

70
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,067
Please don't tell this to your father.

71
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,983
Hey! Wait for me!

72
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:00,900
[indistinct chatter]

73
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,691
Get on.

74
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:16,733
Here is your bag.

75
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:20,025
The bogie number is S9. Look out for it.

76
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,359
Happy journey! I'll come to visit you, Ok?

77
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,359
Be careful!

78
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,400
HIS HIGHNESS - HER MAJESTY
(RAJA - RANI)

79
00:16:57,108 --> 00:17:01,816
Oh my, God! People loved our narrative
and encouraged us with gifts and money.

80
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:05,359
May God bless them and their families.

81
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,025
Let's go back to our story...

82
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,900
Love... Letter...

83
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:23,650
To my dear...

84
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:28,900
-Rani...
-No no no... Strike off 'My'.

85
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,108
To dear Rani...

86
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:38,400
I like you.

87
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,359
-I...
-Like you.

88
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,858
-So much...
-Yes.

89
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:45,733
I like you a lot. Write that.

90
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,858
-I like you a lot...
-A lot...

91
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:50,775
'Like' means?

92
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:55,733
I liked her even before I knew
the meaning of 'Like', right?

93
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,108
-Shall I write the same?
-Yeah.

94
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,483
No!

95
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,108
You are such a good student!

96
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,942
And a great friend to all!

97
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,524
Such a divine smile!

98
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,025
What else?

99
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,233
With that small bindi
on your forehead...

100
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:41,524
Those large expressive eyes...

101
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:43,483
Your double braided hair...

102
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,025
How beautiful she looks! Just like a doll.

103
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,150
Yes, she looks like a cute doll.
What's next?

104
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:57,067
It's not right to like you so
much, without your knowledge...

105
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:00,317
But I feel so scared to tell you all this.

106
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:03,233
Feel so scared...

107
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,608
I don't know why...

108
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,650
I don't know if you'll like it...

109
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,233
So I am writing this letter, not being
able to tell this to you in person.

110
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,359
Yours Raja.

111
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,192
Raja...

112
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,858
There's no mistake in you getting scared.

113
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,150
No girl will fall for you if the love
letter looks like this. They like poets...

114
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,317
Dear... Even the nightingale will go
mute, listening to your voice.

115
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:35,942
The peacock will stand
still, seeing you walk.

116
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:38,983
Like a smile on your lips...
Like a flower under your feet...

117
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:42,733
I'll live this life. Girls won't consider
you without all this decorative stuff.

118
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,108
Shut up!

119
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:48,942
She moved out of the village.

120
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,491
Nothing to worry about...

121
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,699
Her Majesty will definitely come back.

122
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,824
And His Highness will express his love.

123
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,949
There's no doubt about it.

124
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:41,141
She'll come this time.
And I'll propose right away.

125
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:43,599
[sarcastically]: Yes, she will.

126
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,391
-What are you talking?
-Damn!

127
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:47,557
-A? (What?)
-B...

128
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,474
C.

129
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:52,599
Look, brother...

130
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:55,350
No true lover will wait
until the girl comes to him.

131
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:57,224
He will go in search of her.

132
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,557
The enemy left the village.

133
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:04,933
We need her whereabouts.

134
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:07,391
Who will give us the lead?

135
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:09,557
Who will?

136
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,557
He's always late!

137
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:29,308
What, sir? Where are you going?

138
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,016
Nowhere... I'll just come.

139
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,350
-Where to?
-Just here...

140
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,557
-You guys... Come here.
-Don't listen to him. Let's go.

141
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,183
Shut up, idiot! You guys come in.

142
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:54,474
Did you pass the exams?

143
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,099
Both of you?

144
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:01,682
For real?

145
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:05,308
Then what happened to our scoundrel?

146
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:07,724
He should prepare well for the
exams, right?

147
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:11,016
Did I pass the remaining
three without preparation?

148
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,432
Shut up, you fool!

149
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,933
How bad it seems,
if the President's son fails?

150
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,391
Who's President here?

151
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:19,016
The one who won will be called so.
Not the one who lost.

152
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,016
Hey... A dead elephant is as costly
as a living one. Do you know that?

153
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:25,391
What did I not give him?

154
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:28,099
I got him admitted in the
same college as yours, right?

155
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:29,849
I bought him the same books you read.

156
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:34,141
But you both passed the exams.
What's wrong with this rascal?

157
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:43,724
How many bags of grains
did we harvest this year?

158
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,724
How many did Sattibabu
from the adjacent field harvest?

159
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,350
47 or 48.

160
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:51,599
-He used the same fertilizer, right?
-Yes.

161
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,557
-Did he use the same pesticides?
-Yes.

162
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,807
Then what's the reason for the extra bags?

163
00:23:57,474 --> 00:23:58,933
What are you trying to prove?

164
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:01,432
The seed! It's the seed that's defective.

165
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:04,807
-Come on.
-You!

166
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:08,308
What... What the hell
are you talking about?

167
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:12,058
I am asking you...
What are you talking?

168
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:15,849
Is this the way you talk to your father?

169
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:18,599
You think the beard and the
mustache makes you a man?

170
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:20,933
You have no idea how to
talk to the elders anymore.

171
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,933
Can't you control your tongue? Scoundrel!

172
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,350
He gave me the right gift for giving
birth and taking good care of him.

173
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,641
Such an idiot!

174
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:32,891
How can I live after
all that he has said?

175
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,432
Tell me...

176
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,183
Me and my bloody life!
You have your lunch. Go on.

177
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:44,474
It's a China phone.

178
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:46,682
With double SIM and double speaker.

00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:55,408
Who's that?

356
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:58,241
-Hello?
-It's me...

357
00:37:58,282 --> 00:37:59,449
Oh, tell me Geetha.

358
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:52,574
What's this Raja?

359
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:56,158
You never look at me,
no matter who much I stare at you.

360
00:39:58,158 --> 00:39:59,908
You won't answer when I call you.

361
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:02,908
You won't answer my phone calls too.

362
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,950
You won't consider me,
no matter how many times I propose to you.

363
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:10,075
Even after all this,
I am saying this one more time.

364
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:13,950
I love you, Raja.

365
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:41,033
All the villagers live
in a well this small...

366
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:44,117
And think of this as a huge ocean.

367
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:48,700
They feel that they are
large whales or something.

368
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:52,199
Do you know how large our world is?

369
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:58,491
Do you know the total number
of countries in this world?

370
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:00,950
Number of states?

371
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:08,282
At least do you know the number
of districts in our state?

372
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:20,075
Who's our MP?

373
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:23,366
Our MLA?

374
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:26,533
But you know our village
President, right?

375
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:29,449
Go serve at his feet.

376
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:32,449
You will never grow out of all this.

377
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:35,908
Stop watching all these daily serials...

378
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,783
And start watching NEWS
at least now and then.

379
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:42,282
Go, mind your work.

380
00:42:43,658 --> 00:42:45,282
Also, ask your father
to watch some NEWS.

381
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:47,033
Chowdary sir...

382
00:42:47,616 --> 00:42:49,908
-Chowdary sir...
-Yes?

383
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,408
Your Naidu got trashed in the ground.
Badly trashed!

384
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:06,658
Days started melting
down, waiting for Rani.

385
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:09,658
It's been more than two years,
but she never visited the village.

386
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:14,324
Why do you keep following me like a dog?

387
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:16,616
Why do you talk so hurtfully, Raja?

388
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,282
I like you.

389
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:19,825
But I don't.

390
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:21,324
I only like Rani.

391
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:23,324
How many more years will you wait for her?

392
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:24,783
-She'll never come back.
-You...

393
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:29,449
As if she's the only beauty in this world.
There are many other--

394
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:30,700
Stop!

395
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:00,741
[thunderclap]

396
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,616
[boys playing in the ground]

397
00:44:07,783 --> 00:44:09,117
Raja... Hey...

398
00:44:10,658 --> 00:44:11,866
Rani haven't shown up yet?

399
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:24,658
-What did you say?
-What? I just said, 'Hey Raja'.

400
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,658
-After that.
-I asked if Rani hasn't shown up.

401
00:44:49,783 --> 00:44:52,117
-Stop!
-Raja!

402
00:44:52,158 --> 00:44:53,950
-What happened?
-Stop!

403
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,950
-I'll teach you a lesson.
-[both]: What happened?

404
00:44:57,866 --> 00:44:59,075
What happened?

405
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:02,282
-What did he say?
-He said, 'Hey'.

406
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,741
[both]: What?

407
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:06,616
-He said, 'Hey Raja'.
-[both]: He said, 'Hey Raja'?

408
00:45:23,408 --> 00:45:24,908
-Hey!
-Stop!

409
00:45:25,491 --> 00:45:27,533
-She'll never come back.
-Stop.

410
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:42,700
The frustration that emerged out of our
enemy's missing hasn't stopped there.

411
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,866
It kept on piling up day by day.

412
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,033
[low tone]: What happened?

413
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:14,950
Did he hit you?

414
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:16,950
You?

415
00:46:19,825 --> 00:46:21,491
[boys cheering]

416
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:26,991
[announcer]: Sirapuram Youth
is about to win the tournament.

417
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:33,908
The match got so tensed,
as this is the last wicket.

418
00:46:41,158 --> 00:46:42,783
[boys continues to cheer]

419
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:49,658
Come on... Come on...

420
00:46:53,866 --> 00:46:57,950
They are hitting nothing
less than a 6 or a 4.

421
00:46:58,908 --> 00:47:00,033
Pass the ball.

422
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:04,658
Damn!

423
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,117
-Umpire...
-Out...

424
00:47:12,574 --> 00:47:13,616
Out!

425
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:27,282
-What just happened?
-The looser went down...

426
00:47:36,574 --> 00:47:38,533
[boys continues to insult]

427
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,616
-That's a 'Not out'.
-What?

428
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:50,741
-That's a 'Not out'.
-No. You can't overrule the umpire.

429
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,449
That's a 'Not out'.

430
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,574
That's a 'Not out'.

431
00:48:00,366 --> 00:48:01,658
That's a 'Not out'.

432
00:48:04,658 --> 00:48:06,282
Leave me. That's a 'Not out'.

433
00:48:07,741 --> 00:48:08,950
Not out!

434
00:48:19,825 --> 00:48:21,908
-Stop jumping!
-Should we pay any fee?

435
00:48:22,075 --> 00:48:24,491
What fee? It's his own son who trashed us.

436
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:33,491
Stop moving away.

437
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:36,783
Stupid! Useless scoundrel!

438
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:39,408
If you keep on hitting
people and I keep treating them...

439
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,616
People will think that
this is our new business plan.

440
00:48:42,574 --> 00:48:45,408
It's 22 years that I have been living
here and no one ever blamed me.

441
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:47,658
You just keep trashing
all who come your way?

442
00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:50,908
You won't even leave your best friends?

443
00:48:53,366 --> 00:48:55,075
And you...
When will you ever go to college?

444
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,075
Such a lousy college that only
expects students during the exams!

445
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:01,408
Swallow this. Go sit there.

446
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,825
It's not right to leave you so free.

447
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:09,741
I should do something about it.
Can't keep filling all that you dig up.

448
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,484
See, Naidu...

449
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,400
As important as a sword
in the battlefield...

450
00:53:58,442 --> 00:54:01,109
-Morning, Chowdary sir.
-Morning morning...

451
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:02,942
You and your bloody wishes!

452
00:54:03,193 --> 00:54:05,275
You wish us every morning,
but vote for them instead.

453
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:06,692
Continue...

454
00:54:07,692 --> 00:54:08,901
Look, Naidu...

455
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:11,358
As important as a sword
in the battlefield...

456
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,151
Protection is that important.

457
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,901
-Go get one.
-I feel scared, Chowdary.

458
00:54:18,193 --> 00:54:21,484
You silly fellow.
One shouldn't be scared. Go get it.

459
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:25,525
There's no much need for it anyway.
We are just going to make out a little.

460
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:28,358
What? As if you can stop with
just 'making out a little'.

461
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,609
Let's say there is a cracker in my hand...

462
00:54:32,692 --> 00:54:33,942
And a burning matchstick.

463
00:54:37,193 --> 00:54:39,067
Will it stop in the middle?

464
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:42,151
No one can stop it!

465
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:45,984
Go say, 'I need a packet'. He'll get it.

466
00:54:46,234 --> 00:54:47,400
He'll ask for the flavour.

467
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,151
-What flavor do you like?
-What do they have?

468
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:56,859
Vanilla, Banana, Mint, Strawberry...

469
00:54:56,984 --> 00:54:58,234
I like strawberry.

470
00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:02,942
Ask him for the same.

471
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:04,609
He'll hand it to you.

472
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,734
You keep it in your pocket and come back.
It's that simple.

473
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,317
-That's it?
-Yes.

474
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,193
How do you know all this?

475
00:55:12,317 --> 00:55:13,817
Had a long history...

476
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:15,984
Go get them.

477
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:17,692
Why don't you bring it for me?

478
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,817
I shouldn't go.

479
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,151
There's already a lot of rumors on me.
You go get them.

480
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:25,776
-No need.
-What?

481
00:55:26,484 --> 00:55:27,650
I don't need them.

482
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,026
-Go...
-No need.

483
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:30,275
-Go...
-No!

484
00:55:30,317 --> 00:55:32,734
-Just go!
-I said no need.

485
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:56,525
Need a packet.

486
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:58,234
What packet?

487
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:08,734
-Just a second.
-Attend him first.

488
00:56:09,317 --> 00:56:10,734
-What do you want?
-Zandu balm.

489
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:16,901
Naidu...

490
00:56:18,817 --> 00:56:20,026
That's...

491
00:56:20,692 --> 00:56:22,026
Actually it's not for me.

492
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:26,358
One...

493
00:56:27,901 --> 00:56:29,067
[low tone]: Condom packet.

494
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,567
Idiot!

495
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:55,400
Let's go. Move...

496
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:59,817
Stop!

497
00:57:04,817 --> 00:57:05,901
Where are you going?

498
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:08,234
-Will come back in 15 minutes.
-Hey...

499
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:12,151
No hurries. Close the entire
business and then come out. Ok?

500
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:15,193
Where is he going?

501
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:16,984
To the haystack.

502
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:19,734
What for?

503
00:57:39,776 --> 00:57:40,817
Come on...

504
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,650
What?

505
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:51,109
Look at me.

506
00:57:58,067 --> 00:57:59,234
What?

507
00:58:01,484 --> 00:58:02,734
There's no one around here.

508
00:58:08,817 --> 00:58:09,984
Why did you come at all?

509
00:58:10,442 --> 00:58:11,525
Why?

510
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:22,067
We talked about everything, right?

511
00:58:23,484 --> 00:58:24,942
Not everything...

512
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:27,193
-Just a few.
-Whatever the number might be...

513
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:28,609
We have to start first, right?

514
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:32,525
Now my mood went off!

515
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:38,984
What should I do to help?

516
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,776
Kiss me.

517
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,234
-Is it so?
-Yes.

518
00:58:53,984 --> 00:58:55,275
Hey!

519
00:58:57,026 --> 00:58:58,776
-What happened?
-Geetha, you go home.

520
00:58:58,817 --> 00:59:00,400
What happened?

521
00:59:02,942 --> 00:59:04,234
Where did they go?

522
00:59:05,734 --> 00:59:06,984
He took Naidu away.

523
00:59:08,067 --> 00:59:09,358
Oh, God!

524
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:13,442
You have no idea how hard I
worked to make him buy protection.

525
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:15,442
I encouraged him. Motivated--

526
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:27,193
How can anyone take his
lover into the bushes?

527
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:28,525
What did you say?

528
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:30,317
No one down the
history ever did so?

529
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,151
-As if I am the very first guy.
-Shut up!

530
00:59:32,942 --> 00:59:35,317
You should feel ashamed of what you did.

531
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:36,692
Why should I?

532
00:59:36,942 --> 00:59:38,942
A boy entering the bushes,
will come out as a man.

533
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:42,984
Think about the girl... What if
someone sees her in such situation?

534
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:45,026
Nothing even happened to
call it a 'Situation'.

535
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:46,151
What!

536
00:59:46,193 --> 00:59:47,234
Nothing happened?

537
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,692
Not at all. Come here... Come on.

538
00:59:50,026 --> 00:59:52,109
Put your hands on my hips. Go on...

539
00:59:54,442 --> 00:59:56,151
She kept jumping away
from me all the time.

540
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:57,484
No matter how much I tried.

541
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,317
I felt irritated and
started walking away...

542
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:00,650
She caught me by my hand.

543
01:00:00,692 --> 01:00:04,358
So I took it as a sign and
closed on to her, to kiss...

544
01:00:04,525 --> 01:00:07,234
That's it! This idiot came
in and dragged me out.

545
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,984
-Damn you!
-Oh my, God!

546
01:00:09,442 --> 01:00:11,317
I thought, you at least
made out a little.

547
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:12,734
-Absolutely nothing.
-Damn!

548
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,734
Such shameless idiots
you have turned into!

549
01:00:15,193 --> 01:00:16,734
See Mr. Single Status...

550
01:00:17,484 --> 01:00:19,650
You can never understand the
pain of maintaining a GF.

551
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:21,026
What pain are you referring to?

552
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:23,026
-Sexual frustration?
-Look...

553
01:00:23,442 --> 01:00:25,317
Once people get to know
that we are with a girl.

554
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:28,193
Every idiot starts asking,
'So you guys did it'?

555
01:00:28,234 --> 01:00:30,650
If we say 'No', he will look down on us.

556
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,234
If we say 'Yes', he will ask for a number.

557
01:00:33,442 --> 01:00:34,901
We should give him a
record-breaking number.

558
01:00:34,942 --> 01:00:35,942
Then he'll ask for the duration.

559
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:37,567
Should give another
record-breaking number.

560
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:40,484
To fill all those answers, we should
at least be a little experienced...

561
01:00:40,484 --> 01:00:41,525
Right?

562
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:43,650
-Yes, we should.
-Will slap you across your faces...

563
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:46,942
You'll understand if
you have a girlfriend.

564
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:50,358
Even if Rani is here with me,
I'll never take her into the bushes.

565
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:52,151
That's true!

566
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:54,650
You need to propose her,
before even talking about the bushes.

567
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,193
Look, don't get frustrated.

568
01:00:59,525 --> 01:01:02,901
You know, right? I am waiting for
Rani to come so that I can propose.

569
01:01:03,317 --> 01:01:06,067
Yes, you are waiting. But you need
to tell her when she comes, right?

570
01:01:07,942 --> 01:01:09,026
You need to tell her...

571
01:01:13,525 --> 01:01:15,776
-She won't come.
-Will you propose if she comes?

572
01:01:15,942 --> 01:01:17,484
Will you propose if she comes?

573
01:01:17,692 --> 01:01:20,358
-She won't come.
-We'll make her come. Will you propose then?

574
01:01:23,609 --> 01:01:25,776
We'll get her.
Do you have the guts to propose?

575
01:01:28,193 --> 01:01:29,567
What? Speak out.

576
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:34,484
Do you have the guts?

577
01:01:43,442 --> 01:01:44,609
So it's a challenge then?

578
01:01:45,567 --> 01:01:46,692
Yes.

579
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:49,193
-Challenge?
-Yes.

580
01:01:49,692 --> 01:01:51,317
-Challenge?
-Yes.

581
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:53,193
Ok then. Challenge.

582
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:06,817
It took us one whole week
to prepare the perfect plan.

583
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:10,275
We brainstormed until our heads exploded.

584
01:02:11,817 --> 01:02:15,067
Plans... Master plans...

585
01:02:15,609 --> 01:02:17,859
Our only aim is re-entry of the enemy.

586
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,234
Hey, I got an idea.

587
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:32,234
Damn!

588
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:34,734
What's that?

589
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:36,067
Look...

590
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:40,400
Is that a ship?

591
01:02:42,817 --> 01:02:43,859
Oh, it's a bike!

592
01:02:47,484 --> 01:02:48,692
Another bike...

593
01:02:54,442 --> 01:02:55,609
Is that a bomb?

594
01:02:56,817 --> 01:02:58,067
Accident!

595
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,817
Accident?

596
01:03:30,567 --> 01:03:31,817
Will he come this way?

597
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:33,776
He will.

598
01:03:35,026 --> 01:03:37,567
-Will he be alone?
-He will be.

599
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,193
There he is.

600
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,692
He's almost here.

601
01:03:53,151 --> 01:03:54,942
It's not starting. Give it a push.

602
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,734
Get it into gear.

603
01:04:00,234 --> 01:04:01,525
Hop on.

604
01:04:07,151 --> 01:04:08,609
Take a u-turn.

605
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:17,400
Hey!

606
01:04:18,734 --> 01:04:20,234
Stop!

607
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,109
Why is he not making any sound?

608
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:26,234
Is he dead or what?

609
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:41,650
God! You morons...

610
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:43,234
He's alive...

611
01:04:51,234 --> 01:04:54,234
Your Highness...

612
01:04:55,026 --> 01:04:56,442
Hey!

613
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:06,193
-Your father-in-law...
-What happened to him?

614
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:08,734
-He's in those bushes...
-What?

615
01:05:11,692 --> 01:05:13,817
Hey! Stop...

616
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:23,609
God!

617
01:05:25,234 --> 01:05:26,734
Those morons...

618
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:29,609
Someone will hit them too.

619
01:05:29,942 --> 01:05:31,525
They will also suffer like me one day.

620
01:05:32,234 --> 01:05:34,442
Once the reports are here,
let's start the medication.

621
01:05:34,484 --> 01:05:35,650
Ok.

622
01:05:37,442 --> 01:05:40,692
I have known your father for 10 years.
Such a kind man he is.

623
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:43,151
Hey... Tell him.

624
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:45,650
[both]: Go on.

625
01:05:49,817 --> 01:05:51,109
-Uncle...
-Yes?

626
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,358
You should take rest for at least 20 days.

627
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:56,942
-20 days?
-It's a little too dangerous to move.

628
01:05:57,026 --> 01:05:59,567
God! I can't stay put for so long.

629
01:05:59,984 --> 01:06:02,901
People keep coming for ration all day.

630
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:06,151
I can't handle them, staying in bed.

631
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:09,026
Give me any number of injections you want.
But I need to be normal.

632
01:06:09,026 --> 01:06:13,026
No, you need to be really careful.
To take care of you...

633
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:16,609
There should be at least
one person with you.

634
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:18,859
It's been 10 years since
my wife passed away.

635
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:23,525
I never thought of marrying again...

636
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:28,567
[breaking sentence]: No no.
It would be helpful if Rani is here.

637
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:31,859
No.

638
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:36,734
-I made her stay there for 3 years--
-Three and a half...

639
01:06:36,817 --> 01:06:39,317
Right right... You are classmates, yes.

640
01:06:39,525 --> 01:06:42,901
-Three and a half years. That inti...
-Integrated engineering.

641
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:46,026
Integrated engineering.
It's a very worthy course.

642
01:06:46,442 --> 01:06:49,193
And it's a prestigious college.
Do you know in which city?

643
01:06:50,026 --> 01:06:51,358
In her grandmother's city.

644
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:55,193
So let's not disturb her.
You settle this somehow.

645
01:06:56,817 --> 01:06:57,901
Ok.

646
01:07:02,692 --> 01:07:03,817
The reports are here.

647
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,692
So fast!

648
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:07,358
Yes.

649
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:10,026
Let me...

650
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:20,817
-BP...
-How much is it?

651
01:07:24,776 --> 01:07:25,901
260!

652
01:07:28,442 --> 01:07:30,525
-Sugar...
-How much is that?

653
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:32,650
560!

654
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:36,525
Water in lungs. Stones in kidneys.

655
01:07:39,984 --> 01:07:42,942
What's all this?
I just met with an accident, right?

656
01:07:45,193 --> 01:07:46,442
How did all this happen?

657
01:07:48,817 --> 01:07:50,567
You have them already.

658
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:52,901
They just got detected now.

659
01:07:56,193 --> 01:07:57,484
Don't worry, uncle.

660
01:07:57,984 --> 01:08:00,234
We can't say that the reports
come out right all the time.

661
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,234
I'll take care of it.

662
01:08:03,859 --> 01:08:05,026
But...

663
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,817
It's better you call Rani,
so that she can take care of you.

664
01:09:34,984 --> 01:09:36,151
Come on.

665
01:09:46,151 --> 01:09:47,692
Leave all this...

666
01:09:48,193 --> 01:09:51,360
We won from our side.
Tell us what you are going to do.

667
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:55,151
I agree that you guys helped a lot.

668
01:09:55,568 --> 01:09:57,110
That's what we are.

669
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,776
So much thinking and planning.

670
01:10:00,485 --> 01:10:01,692
So many clever plots!

671
01:10:02,276 --> 01:10:03,776
We used up all that we have got.

672
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:08,360
Silly old man...

673
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:12,568
We haven't even hit him yet... He just
drove into the bushes all by himself.

674
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:14,360
This bad deed is yours to pay for.

675
01:10:15,568 --> 01:10:17,692
-What did I do?
-You do nothing.

676
01:10:17,818 --> 01:10:19,527
That's what we feel bad about.

677
01:10:19,943 --> 01:10:22,360
We make her come back,
using all this planning.

678
01:10:22,568 --> 01:10:27,609
But I doubt if you'll
ever go and talk to her.

679
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,734
Guys, please stop!

680
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:36,235
-I'll do whatever that had to be done.
-What about our challenge?

681
01:10:36,568 --> 01:10:39,609
I mean, if you can help me a
little with my challenge too...

682
01:10:39,984 --> 01:10:42,360
-I will also win.
-What kind of help?

683
01:10:43,568 --> 01:10:45,360
-Should we go tell her about your love?
-No!

684
01:10:45,734 --> 01:10:47,193
Why would I say that?

685
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,318
That's really a very...

686
01:10:50,568 --> 01:10:53,734
-Important thing in my life...
-[both]: Damn!

687
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:57,026
But... How to tell...

688
01:10:57,568 --> 01:10:58,859
What to tell...

689
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:00,692
See Your Highness...

690
01:11:00,734 --> 01:11:02,527
Don't think too much.

691
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,651
Tomorrow... 6:30, early in the morning...

692
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:08,026
Let's go to the bus stand.

693
01:11:08,984 --> 01:11:10,651
And keep waiting.

694
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:53,818
Do you know how much I
have been waiting for you?

695
01:11:55,527 --> 01:11:56,818
For you to come see me...

696
01:11:57,609 --> 01:11:59,110
I too waited a lot.

697
01:12:00,443 --> 01:12:01,734
I always wanted to come.

698
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,692
Every day... Every minute...

699
01:12:04,943 --> 01:12:07,026
But you never told me where to find you.

700
01:12:12,026 --> 01:12:13,401
I tried a lot...

701
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:17,443
For your address...
For your college name...

702
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:19,984
You phone number...
Your Facebook id...

703
01:12:20,026 --> 01:12:21,734
For one little hint to get to you.

704
01:12:23,485 --> 01:12:24,568
But I found none.

705
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:27,485
I am right in front of you now, Raja.

706
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:31,485
Tell me.

707
01:12:32,776 --> 01:12:34,859
-Tell her.
-Come on.

708
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:38,235
-Tell her. You can.
-Come on, tell her.

709
01:12:38,235 --> 01:12:39,901
Shut up! Stop!

710
01:12:40,984 --> 01:12:42,401
Why are you even there?

711
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,151
No need of you guys. I'll go alone.

712
01:12:46,527 --> 01:12:49,110
God! Go...

713
01:12:50,651 --> 01:12:53,360
Hello, remember this...

714
01:12:53,609 --> 01:12:55,568
If you don't propose to her tomorrow...

715
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:58,943
I'll tell her that you are the one
behind the accident. And you'll be done.

716
01:14:23,235 --> 01:14:26,859
Why so hurry, you idiot?
Won't you let us get down?

717
01:14:27,235 --> 01:14:28,984
She can't even wait for me to get off.

718
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:45,734
Rani?

719
01:14:50,943 --> 01:14:51,984
Rani?

720
01:14:54,318 --> 01:14:55,443
Raja!

721
01:14:56,734 --> 01:14:57,859
How are you?

722
01:14:59,984 --> 01:15:01,151
Are you doing good?

723
01:15:03,527 --> 01:15:04,692
I came for you.

724
01:15:05,943 --> 01:15:08,859
Your dad sent me to pick you up.

725
01:15:09,818 --> 01:15:10,901
Thank you.

726
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,984
My grandmother is also here.

727
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:19,318
Can't you wait until I get down?

728
01:15:20,276 --> 01:15:21,692
You can't stand still at all!

729
01:15:22,193 --> 01:15:24,235
Will your father start
walking if you go early?

730
01:15:24,276 --> 01:15:26,318
-Grandma...
-What?

731
01:15:27,984 --> 01:15:29,692
This is Raja. My classmate.

732
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,443
He's here to take us home.

733
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,609
I'll get the bike.

734
01:15:37,026 --> 01:15:39,485
You should have told me, right?
You got down alone.

735
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:44,360
How can we all go on that bike?

736
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:49,901
Listen, this bike won't work.
Call an auto for us, we'll go home.

737
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:00,527
Grandma, you get on this scooter.

738
01:16:01,318 --> 01:16:03,235
-Chowdary!
-How are you?

739
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:05,776
-Yeah. Are you doing good?
-Yeah.

740
01:16:06,651 --> 01:16:08,235
Yeah, he's also doing good.

741
01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:11,943
Come, let's go.

742
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:15,026
-What's your caste?
-God!

743
01:16:16,568 --> 01:16:17,692
Grandma!

744
01:16:25,193 --> 01:16:26,609
Sit carefully.

745
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,485
Careful!

746
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:34,901
If you fail to do as you said...

747
01:16:40,401 --> 01:16:41,692
Careful Rani...

748
01:18:46,026 --> 01:18:47,110
Bring them in.

749
01:18:47,818 --> 01:18:48,901
God!

750
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:56,193
Did you tell her?

751
01:19:06,151 --> 01:19:07,360
You idiot!

752
01:19:12,568 --> 01:19:13,734
Rani?

753
01:19:20,151 --> 01:19:21,360
What's this dear?

754
01:19:21,901 --> 01:19:24,984
Nothing happened to me.
It's just a small sprain.

755
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:31,110
No no... Don't cry.

756
01:19:31,318 --> 01:19:33,527
Are you feeling better now?

757
01:19:38,193 --> 01:19:40,527
He won't talk. He hates us.

758
01:19:43,068 --> 01:19:44,485
Uncle hates her...

759
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,609
I went into the bushes that day.

760
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:53,568
Right then, Raja came and brought me home.
He also treated me well.

761
01:19:58,776 --> 01:19:59,776
Thanks!

762
01:24:21,568 --> 01:24:22,984
-I'll...
-Some for me.

763
01:24:26,859 --> 01:24:28,068
What lords?

764
01:24:28,609 --> 01:24:32,068
You keep roaming around that
dealer's house 24/7 these days.

765
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:35,110
Matter of love?

766
01:24:40,068 --> 01:24:42,568
-What love?
-Shut up, you donkey.

767
01:24:43,651 --> 01:24:45,984
Will it lead to marriage?
Or it's just 'English love'?

768
01:24:48,776 --> 01:24:50,151
Speak out, idiot!

769
01:24:50,401 --> 01:24:52,235
The dealer is already a complicated man.

770
01:24:52,401 --> 01:24:54,818
If it's what I think it
is, I'll at least pamper him slowly.

771
01:24:55,609 --> 01:24:57,151
We also have the caste problem, right?

772
01:24:58,651 --> 01:25:01,984
How can we know? Is your son
doing everything after consulting us?

773
01:25:02,485 --> 01:25:04,568
Stop, Mr. President of all idiots.

774
01:25:04,776 --> 01:25:09,193
I doubt that one day he'll take your
bloody advice and elope with her.

775
01:25:09,485 --> 01:25:12,568
I'll tear your skin off,
if you do anything that stupid.

776
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,026
Got it?

777
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:17,901
Bring her home if you want to. Understood?

778
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:23,360
Bring some salt.

779
01:25:23,859 --> 01:25:26,193
See, one should feed and
take care of his wife.

780
01:25:26,609 --> 01:25:29,443
You can't depend on your parents forever.

781
01:25:29,568 --> 01:25:31,026
I won't even lend you the salt.

782
01:25:31,068 --> 01:25:32,568
Why try to educate us, sir?

783
01:25:33,443 --> 01:25:35,235
I'll call your son.
You talk to him directly.

784
01:25:35,276 --> 01:25:38,193
I will. When the time comes, I'll talk
to him after trashing him properly.

785
01:25:39,485 --> 01:25:40,692
Get him one more dosa.

786
01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:55,859
[low tone]: His mom thinks that
he's innocent. She has no idea!

787
01:25:59,235 --> 01:26:02,485
Roaming around a girl and being
innocent are two different things.

788
01:26:03,193 --> 01:26:05,318
Even Gods went to war for women.

789
01:26:05,943 --> 01:26:07,235
Is it?

790
01:26:07,485 --> 01:26:10,568
You are a politician, right?
You are bound to talk stuff like that.

791
01:26:11,651 --> 01:26:14,235
Eat... Go on...

792
01:26:17,318 --> 01:26:20,235
What about you, criminal cat! Huh?

793
01:26:20,859 --> 01:26:22,984
These days,
I keep learning about you too.

794
01:26:24,485 --> 01:26:25,984
Sit. Sit down and eat.

795
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:34,527
Call me once you are done. I'll come.

796
01:26:51,193 --> 01:26:52,943
How many more years
will you wait for Rani?

797
01:26:53,901 --> 01:26:55,068
She won't come back.

798
01:27:25,443 --> 01:27:26,485
What happened?

799
01:27:30,485 --> 01:27:31,984
What happened? Why are you laughing?

800
01:27:32,692 --> 01:27:33,859
Nothing...

801
01:27:36,276 --> 01:27:39,568
Hey! Chowdary, tell me.
Why are you laughing?

802
01:27:39,984 --> 01:27:42,692
-You dropped Rani at Geetha's house!
-So?

803
01:27:42,818 --> 01:27:44,943
We mean, you dropped her
all by yourself, right?

804
01:27:51,776 --> 01:27:52,859
Hey!

805
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:55,151
No...

806
01:27:55,734 --> 01:27:57,193
Give it to me.

807
01:27:57,901 --> 01:27:59,401
Hey, give me the phone.

808
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:02,818
Come on... Hey, Naidu. Stop!

809
01:28:03,151 --> 01:28:05,193
Naidu, stop!

810
01:28:05,235 --> 01:28:06,485
Give me that bloody phone.

811
01:28:07,443 --> 01:28:08,901
Stop, Naidu!

812
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:12,026
Hey, stop!

813
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,901
Chowdary, stop!

814
01:28:17,984 --> 01:28:19,318
Chowdary...

815
01:28:20,984 --> 01:28:23,026
Leave me. It's his plan entirely.

816
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:27,110
Don't act smart. I'll kill you.

817
01:28:30,734 --> 01:28:33,485
Why is he running like that?
What happened?

818
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,026
There is an exam he should pass.

819
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:41,276
He's not cracking it on his own and
running away if we try to hand him chits.

820
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:45,443
Damn! You concentrate on your exams first.
Why do you care about them?

821
01:28:45,818 --> 01:28:48,818
Helping other...
As if he passed all the exams!

822
01:28:57,235 --> 01:28:58,859
-No...
-What 'No'?

823
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:01,859
Call her and tell her not to.

824
01:29:03,318 --> 01:29:04,734
Call her and tell her not to.

825
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:10,193
-Why?
-Call her, please.

826
01:29:10,276 --> 01:29:11,692
Please, tell her not to.

827
01:29:13,776 --> 01:29:16,026
You won't tell her anyways.
At least let Geetha tell her.

828
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,443
Call her...

829
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,276
I can't help if it's already too late.

830
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:34,609
Are you free tomorrow?

831
01:31:37,527 --> 01:31:40,235
I vowed something to God long back
and never found time to pay it.

832
01:31:41,193 --> 01:31:42,651
I need to go to the temple tomorrow.

833
01:31:42,984 --> 01:31:44,193
Yeah, Ok.

834
01:31:47,643 --> 01:31:50,226
For the stream of thoughts
that flow inside the heart...

835
01:31:50,976 --> 01:31:52,852
And for the war that
happens inside a being...

836
01:31:52,893 --> 01:31:55,101
Even the Lord is no exception.

837
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:58,393
Then what is it really? Fear? Or doubt?

838
01:31:59,017 --> 01:32:02,810
The Lord who rules over all
the universes... Is he in fear?

839
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:04,393
Yes!

840
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:06,268
Rather than winning over
all the existence...

841
01:32:06,518 --> 01:32:10,184
It's more difficult to win
the cosmic heart of a woman.

842
01:32:10,726 --> 01:32:11,976
Even then...

843
01:32:12,351 --> 01:32:15,685
He wanted to express his
feelings to Mother Goddess.

844
01:32:15,893 --> 01:32:19,810
The Lord decided on it very strongly.

845
01:32:35,226 --> 01:32:38,143
[religious chants on dreams coming true]

846
01:33:30,518 --> 01:33:31,685
Rani?

847
01:34:09,518 --> 01:34:10,768
What did you pray for, Raja?

848
01:34:14,893 --> 01:34:16,768
Did you ask the God
anything for your future?

849
01:34:24,017 --> 01:34:25,852
I heard that you don't
like this profession.

850
01:34:29,476 --> 01:34:32,685
You are doing this as your
father forced you to... Is it so?

851
01:34:35,518 --> 01:34:36,685
Who told you?

852
01:34:39,934 --> 01:34:41,143
Geetha did.

853
01:34:42,768 --> 01:34:45,309
Chowdary loves politics.
Naidu loves business.

854
01:34:45,893 --> 01:34:46,976
What do you love?

855
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:51,101
What else did Geetha say?

856
01:34:53,476 --> 01:34:54,768
A lot...

857
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,435
That Swetha irritated you all the time...

858
01:35:04,017 --> 01:35:05,560
Don't you like Swetha?

859
01:35:12,101 --> 01:35:14,143
Geetha said nothing else?

860
01:35:16,184 --> 01:35:17,351
What else?

861
01:35:19,268 --> 01:35:21,852
Nothing that I can remember.

862
01:35:29,976 --> 01:35:32,810
Why are you standing in the sun?
Would have gone inside.

863
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:34,017
[both]: We'll come.

864
01:35:35,518 --> 01:35:36,810
-Come on.
-Yeah, we will.

865
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:38,976
Whose car is this?

866
01:35:39,768 --> 01:35:41,059
Some relatives.

867
01:35:44,017 --> 01:35:45,226
Did she ask you anything?

868
01:35:50,184 --> 01:35:51,560
At least, did you open up to her?

869
01:36:02,226 --> 01:36:03,726
-Come in.
-I won't.

870
01:36:03,976 --> 01:36:05,560
-Come on...
-No. You go.

871
01:36:09,017 --> 01:36:12,685
I took a left seeing them come close...
That's it...

872
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,476
Here she is.

873
01:36:15,934 --> 01:36:17,226
We are just talking about you.

874
01:36:18,601 --> 01:36:21,143
-Brother-in-law? When did you come?
-Just now.

875
01:36:22,059 --> 01:36:24,143
-Doing good?
-Yeah.

876
01:36:24,476 --> 01:36:27,643
-Aunty isn't here?
-No. Where are you coming from?

877
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:30,435
-From the temple.
-They will never respect humans.

878
01:36:30,643 --> 01:36:32,226
-Bloody morons!
-Where is the temple?

879
01:36:32,268 --> 01:36:33,518
It's in our village itself.

880
01:36:35,184 --> 01:36:38,143
Uncle is just saying...
It seems you applied for a long leave.

881
01:36:39,435 --> 01:36:43,184
Santhu... That's Raja. My doctor.

882
01:36:43,852 --> 01:36:45,560
He is the one who treated me.

883
01:36:45,643 --> 01:36:47,685
Raja... That's my sister's son.

884
01:36:48,726 --> 01:36:49,810
He's also a doctor.

885
01:36:51,852 --> 01:36:54,476
-Teeth doctor.
-He mean 'Dentist'.

886
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:56,268
-I am Santhosh.
-Hello!

887
01:37:00,017 --> 01:37:01,768
Did you tell him anything
about the reports?

888
01:37:02,393 --> 01:37:03,643
No. Why do you ask?

889
01:37:04,435 --> 01:37:07,184
They are not yours.
The reports got mixed up.

890
01:37:08,101 --> 01:37:09,810
We trashed the boy in the lab.

891
01:37:11,643 --> 01:37:13,017
Don't tell him anything about it.

892
01:37:13,768 --> 01:37:14,852
He'll get panicked.

893
01:37:16,726 --> 01:37:19,852
I planned to bring along mom and dad.
But they got busy.

894
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:23,518
-You are from around here?
-Yes.

895
01:37:24,768 --> 01:37:26,393
-How long did you practice?
-Who's he?

896
01:37:26,393 --> 01:37:28,101
-From the last few months.
-Her aunt's son.

897
01:37:29,893 --> 01:37:31,726
-You won't talk to him?
-No.

898
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:35,685
-Do they hate you?
-No. I hate them.

899
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:39,518
-How long will he stay?
-Who knows?

900
01:37:39,518 --> 01:37:42,852
When will he come and when will he leave!
They inform no one.

901
01:37:43,143 --> 01:37:44,560
Planning-less fools!

902
01:37:50,268 --> 01:37:51,810
[inaudible]

903
01:38:10,309 --> 01:38:14,017
We thought the enemy is here
and it will be an easy kill.

904
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:18,852
But we are losing hope
with every passing day.

905
01:38:20,518 --> 01:38:22,852
You just come to Hyderabad.
I'll take care of everything.

906
01:38:23,976 --> 01:38:25,810
There's no need for
joining any course at all.

907
01:38:26,226 --> 01:38:28,393
I have a lot of patients
from the Software field.

908
01:38:30,601 --> 01:38:32,059
There's still time for that.

909
01:38:32,643 --> 01:38:34,393
Time? It runs faster than we think.

910
01:38:47,726 --> 01:38:48,810
Slowly...

911
01:38:50,518 --> 01:38:52,726
It's being so difficult to walk.
Give that to him.

912
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,226
Naidu?

913
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:02,893
Chowdary.

914
01:39:04,268 --> 01:39:05,435
Naidu.

915
01:39:07,351 --> 01:39:08,643
What do you do?

916
01:39:11,184 --> 01:39:12,560
I completed my degree.

917
01:39:13,351 --> 01:39:14,893
But few subjects are still remaining.

918
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:20,059
That's why... I am waiting
for the village council elections.

919
01:39:21,226 --> 01:39:24,268
One day... I'll be the village head.

920
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:27,059
So you all are one and the same?

921
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:29,017
Politics, Movies, Caste feelings...

922
01:39:29,143 --> 01:39:31,435
You never think of getting
educated and bagging a job?

923
01:39:34,184 --> 01:39:36,226
-What about you?
-PG.

924
01:39:36,476 --> 01:39:38,101
Your village have a PG college too?

925
01:39:43,768 --> 01:39:45,309
Which class are your
kids studying in?

926
01:39:45,309 --> 01:39:47,393
Hey, I am not married yet.

927
01:39:48,893 --> 01:39:51,101
I used to play with Rani right
here, when we were kids.

928
01:39:56,226 --> 01:39:57,685
You used to babysit her?

929
01:39:58,017 --> 01:39:59,934
No no. We are of the same age.

930
01:40:13,101 --> 01:40:16,184
Rani, we have a huge
doubt since so long ago.

931
01:40:17,476 --> 01:40:18,726
What's such a huge doubt?

932
01:40:20,435 --> 01:40:21,934
What city your grandmother lives in?

933
01:40:22,893 --> 01:40:25,017
What's the name of that
prestigious college?

934
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:33,601
What happened?

935
01:40:33,852 --> 01:40:36,768
Nothing. I have been controlling
for a long time now.

936
01:40:37,143 --> 01:40:39,268
[in slang]: Your language
have this crazy slang...

937
01:40:39,268 --> 01:40:42,393
[in slang]: We know no slang at all.
So funny!

938
01:40:43,143 --> 01:40:46,268
[in slang]: Ok, you wanted to go get
some certificate, right? Let's go.

939
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,685
What certificate?

940
01:40:49,852 --> 01:40:52,101
I have to go to the MRO office
for my birth-certificate.

941
01:40:53,184 --> 01:40:55,643
Raja is taking the same route.
Ask him to drop you.

942
01:40:57,309 --> 01:41:00,685
Why to go on a bike?
Let's go in my car. Come on.

943
01:41:01,184 --> 01:41:02,893
Why is he here in the first place?

944
01:41:03,476 --> 01:41:06,685
To pay his condolence to his
uncle meeting with an accident.

945
01:41:07,309 --> 01:41:09,101
What should he do?

946
01:41:09,143 --> 01:41:13,309
Eat and drink all that is offered
and leave the very next day.

947
01:41:13,476 --> 01:41:14,893
Then why didn't he leave?

948
01:41:14,893 --> 01:41:16,476
It's been a week.

949
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,976
It's Ok if he stays long.
But is he sitting still?

950
01:41:19,059 --> 01:41:20,268
No!

951
01:41:21,393 --> 01:41:23,351
He's giving her a knife to chop the onions.

952
01:41:24,184 --> 01:41:25,893
He's supplying pan for
her to prepare dosa.

953
01:41:26,601 --> 01:41:28,435
He's handing her the
broom to clean the house.

954
01:41:28,852 --> 01:41:30,560
And putting curry in
her plate as she eats.

955
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:34,393
-Why should all this bother us?
-How can you say so?

956
01:41:34,934 --> 01:41:36,143
What is he talking?

957
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:40,435
How is your lover's
brother-in-law related to you?

958
01:41:40,476 --> 01:41:41,560
How?

959
01:41:41,852 --> 01:41:44,476
How else? He will be your villain.

960
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:49,852
Hello, RMP sir.

961
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,309
Doing good?

962
01:41:56,476 --> 01:41:57,601
Yeah.

963
01:41:57,726 --> 01:42:00,184
My daughter has some
work in the MRO office.

964
01:42:00,393 --> 01:42:02,309
It made me finally step out of the house.

965
01:42:04,893 --> 01:42:07,101
Yes, of course... How's your leg now?

966
01:42:07,976 --> 01:42:10,184
It's all good now.
Just because of your son.

967
01:42:11,393 --> 01:42:14,476
-Really happy.
-Yeah... He's also a doctor.

968
01:42:15,476 --> 01:42:17,852
My sister's son. He's well educated.

969
01:42:18,184 --> 01:42:19,518
Not just RMP.

970
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:24,309
My son-in-law.

971
01:42:32,852 --> 01:42:35,101
Ok then... Take care of your health.

972
01:42:35,852 --> 01:42:37,435
Ok. Let's go.

973
01:43:03,476 --> 01:43:05,143
What's with your dad's expression?

974
01:43:05,893 --> 01:43:07,143
Seems so deep!

975
01:43:08,101 --> 01:43:09,393
Really...

976
01:43:11,685 --> 01:43:14,768
I am telling you.
I doubt that brother-in-law fellow.

977
01:43:17,393 --> 01:43:19,017
I too have the same doubt.

978
01:43:20,476 --> 01:43:21,685
What doubt?

979
01:43:23,184 --> 01:43:25,435
You should be clear about the
doubt, right?

980
01:43:25,601 --> 01:43:28,017
It's not us who have to be clear.
It's you.

981
01:43:28,685 --> 01:43:30,976
Why do you keep nagging me all the time?

982
01:43:32,059 --> 01:43:33,435
You are being obsessed with it.

983
01:43:36,268 --> 01:43:39,518
Ok, sir. Ok... As we are that foolish...

984
01:43:40,643 --> 01:43:42,934
You stay calm and all.
We'll take care of it.

985
01:43:44,309 --> 01:43:45,393
Ok?

986
01:43:47,518 --> 01:43:49,268
We will. Come on.

987
01:43:49,976 --> 01:43:51,393
-Let's be in our limits.
-Hey!

988
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:54,351
-Naidu stop!
-What?

989
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:56,226
Stop!

990
01:44:01,726 --> 01:44:03,143
Chowdary, stop!

991
01:44:08,101 --> 01:44:09,643
-Hey, stop!
-You...

992
01:44:11,435 --> 01:44:13,268
You idiots!

993
01:44:41,184 --> 01:44:45,518
He haven't come with a clean heart.
I knew this from the beginning.

994
01:44:46,184 --> 01:44:48,643
-Why do you feel so bad?
-What else should I feel?

995
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:51,309
She's studying, right!
Why get her married now?

996
01:44:51,309 --> 01:44:53,601
Yeah... I know about my
daughter's education.

997
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:58,893
Of course, she's your daughter. That's
why you decided to get her married to him.

998
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:01,476
Who will recognize our
contribution in her life?

999
01:45:01,893 --> 01:45:03,810
Stop your useless discussion.

1000
01:45:04,852 --> 01:45:07,810
Of course,
we seem useless to you now.

1001
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:10,643
I lost my respect right
when my daughter died.

1002
01:45:10,643 --> 01:45:14,768
How else will you look at us now?
This is the fate written for us!

1003
01:45:15,101 --> 01:45:17,768
Your fate is to point at us.
Our fate is to take the blame.

1004
01:45:18,268 --> 01:45:20,017
As if I am getting her
married to a fool!

1005
01:45:20,059 --> 01:45:22,643
He's related, settled and a nice guy.
He's a doctor for god sake.

1006
01:45:23,143 --> 01:45:26,476
Right! For a girl who's
just 15 years old...

1007
01:45:26,726 --> 01:45:29,643
And to that 30 year old fellow...
It's a nice match. Get them married.

1008
01:45:29,768 --> 01:45:31,518
Will you stop at that?

1009
01:45:32,101 --> 01:45:33,226
Please!

1010
01:45:35,017 --> 01:45:37,017
-Screaming to the entire village.
-Calm down, dad.

1011
01:45:37,059 --> 01:45:39,184
Ask her to stop first. What's all this?

1012
01:45:39,393 --> 01:45:41,893
Yes! We don't know how to treat a human.

1013
01:45:42,059 --> 01:45:44,268
Why should I even care?
I'll die soon anyway.

1014
01:45:50,101 --> 01:45:51,226
Rani?

1015
01:45:55,143 --> 01:45:57,017
Am I not the one to decide
about your marriage?

1016
01:45:58,435 --> 01:45:59,893
Of course it's your decision, dad.

1017
01:46:00,601 --> 01:46:01,976
But...

1018
01:46:04,226 --> 01:46:06,476
I'll get married once I
am done with my studies.

1019
01:46:07,059 --> 01:46:09,184
Hey, it won't be a problem Rani.

1020
01:46:09,268 --> 01:46:12,184
You can study after marriage.
I take full responsibility for that.

1021
01:46:12,226 --> 01:46:15,101
Yes. He will get you educated.

1022
01:46:16,184 --> 01:46:18,726
He came flying like a vulture. Scoundrel!

1023
01:46:19,017 --> 01:46:20,184
Will you please stop!

1024
01:47:19,017 --> 01:47:20,435
Why will she call you for nothing?

1025
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:22,768
You should have told her
that you love her, right?

1026
01:47:24,017 --> 01:47:26,143
She said 'No' to marriage
for the sake of education.

1027
01:47:26,768 --> 01:47:28,810
Won't she say no to love,
just for the same reason?

1028
01:47:29,393 --> 01:47:32,518
Should have told her that you'll marry
her after she's done with her studies.

1029
01:47:33,351 --> 01:47:35,017
He asked her to study after marriage.

1030
01:47:35,601 --> 01:47:37,518
Should I ask her to study
while being in love?

1031
01:47:52,143 --> 01:47:53,309
Leave it!

1032
01:47:53,476 --> 01:47:56,685
We won't be talking all this if you have
proposed to her when the time is right.

1033
01:47:58,101 --> 01:48:00,309
Yes. I can't do it.

1034
01:48:01,143 --> 01:48:02,476
I can't express my love.

1035
01:48:03,309 --> 01:48:05,268
This is what they call
'Fear of rejection'.

1036
01:48:05,976 --> 01:48:07,059
Means?

1037
01:48:07,101 --> 01:48:08,268
Fear...

1038
01:48:09,643 --> 01:48:11,435
It grows along with love.

1039
01:48:12,893 --> 01:48:15,351
It's not really tough to
tell her that I like her.

1040
01:48:16,143 --> 01:48:19,184
But to take the rejection...

1041
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,726
One need a lot of courage.

1042
01:48:22,268 --> 01:48:23,685
I don't have that kind of courage.

1043
01:48:26,393 --> 01:48:28,101
Don't recite drama dialogues.

1044
01:48:30,643 --> 01:48:31,934
Take it the way you want to.

1045
01:48:32,435 --> 01:48:34,601
But everything should happen
according to Rani's wish.

1046
01:48:34,726 --> 01:48:36,768
Love... Marriage...

1047
01:48:37,393 --> 01:48:38,810
Him... Me... Everything!

1048
01:48:56,309 --> 01:49:00,309
All these days, our enemy is a young girl.

1049
01:49:02,143 --> 01:49:04,518
We hesitated to kill her.

1050
01:49:06,726 --> 01:49:10,601
But today you replaced her.

1051
01:49:18,435 --> 01:49:21,268
His son-in-law should die...

1052
01:49:21,852 --> 01:49:23,476
And that should calm us down.

1053
01:49:27,226 --> 01:49:29,184
Rest in peace.

1054
01:49:32,768 --> 01:49:35,351
-Will slash him from the front.
-Will kill from behind.

1055
01:49:38,518 --> 01:49:40,393
I'll cut his tongue.

1056
01:49:40,643 --> 01:49:42,643
-It's not me.
-What are you talking about?

1057
01:49:43,101 --> 01:49:44,435
[both]: What are you talking?

1058
01:49:44,435 --> 01:49:46,810
I am not the one.
I am not his son-in-law.

1059
01:49:47,059 --> 01:49:49,934
-[both]: No?
-No. That's not me.

1060
01:49:50,226 --> 01:49:52,059
-It's not you?
-Not me.

1061
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:54,101
Are you telling the truth?

1062
01:49:54,976 --> 01:49:55,976
Yes!

1063
01:49:56,601 --> 01:49:59,435
-It's a lie.
-What's true and what's not?

1064
01:49:59,435 --> 01:50:03,226
It's true that uncle
forced me to marry Rani.

1065
01:50:03,476 --> 01:50:04,893
But me agreeing for it is a lie.

1066
01:50:05,184 --> 01:50:07,268
[both]: You didn't agree for it?

1067
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:10,226
No! No!

1068
01:50:12,351 --> 01:50:14,309
-I said 'No'.
-Why?

1069
01:50:14,518 --> 01:50:16,101
There are biological reasons.

1070
01:50:16,518 --> 01:50:18,518
Not to marry blood relatives...

1071
01:50:20,309 --> 01:50:22,976
Consanguineous marriage is
associated with an increased risk...

1072
01:50:23,101 --> 01:50:25,101
For congenital malformations.

1073
01:50:25,143 --> 01:50:27,393
And autosomal recessive diseases--

1074
01:50:27,393 --> 01:50:30,893
Hey! Put it in a single sentence.
That too in Telugu.

1075
01:50:31,768 --> 01:50:33,268
I need some water.

1076
01:50:42,143 --> 01:50:43,976
Please leave me, sir.

1077
01:50:45,268 --> 01:50:46,309
Please, sir.

1078
01:50:48,518 --> 01:50:49,852
Please! I am innocent, sir.

1079
01:50:51,309 --> 01:50:52,685
Please leave me, sir.

1080
01:50:56,476 --> 01:50:57,560
Give it to him.

1081
01:50:58,768 --> 01:50:59,852
Go on.

1082
01:51:15,601 --> 01:51:17,101
Tell us now.

1083
01:51:17,226 --> 01:51:19,601
It's not healthy to marry blood relatives.

1084
01:51:19,852 --> 01:51:22,560
That's why I said 'No' to my uncle.

1085
01:51:24,601 --> 01:51:25,810
Should we believe him?

1086
01:51:28,685 --> 01:51:30,643
No. I will kill him.

1087
01:51:30,852 --> 01:51:32,685
We should believe our fellow humans.

1088
01:51:36,685 --> 01:51:39,893
He knows our story now.
What if he rats us out?

1089
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:43,934
-Sir?
-Shhh!

1090
01:51:46,017 --> 01:51:47,435
What should we do now?

1091
01:51:47,476 --> 01:51:49,643
Let's bury him right
here and sow a plant in his name.

1092
01:51:50,101 --> 01:51:52,685
Mother promise, sir!
I will disappear out of your lives.

1093
01:51:53,351 --> 01:51:54,351
Leave me, sir.

1094
01:51:57,476 --> 01:51:58,768
God!

1095
01:51:59,518 --> 01:52:01,685
It's Ok. Let's leave him this time.

1096
01:52:02,726 --> 01:52:05,435
If he acts smart,
let's hunt him down and slash him.

1097
01:52:14,976 --> 01:52:16,017
Please leave me, sir.

1098
01:52:22,184 --> 01:52:23,268
Lucky boy!

1099
01:52:33,476 --> 01:52:34,768
Hey!

1100
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:55,143
Let's not interfere anymore.

1101
01:52:56,768 --> 01:53:00,685
It's so easy to ask him to propose
and get angry when he fails to do so.

1102
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:08,309
Only when we can love as truly as he
does, we'll understand his fear and pain.

1103
01:53:14,309 --> 01:53:16,101
There are many stories
on those who proposed.

1104
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,351
This is the story of the one who can't.

1105
01:53:25,643 --> 01:53:29,685
People become so foolish right
when they need to be really smart!

1106
01:53:30,101 --> 01:53:33,685
You kept praising him
through the day and night.

1107
01:53:34,143 --> 01:53:39,226
He made her think of
marriage and suddenly disappeared.

1108
01:53:39,768 --> 01:53:42,560
Nerveless tongues and orderless brains.

1109
01:53:43,017 --> 01:53:45,059
As if I don't know about you guys.

1110
01:53:45,101 --> 01:53:47,435
You all are the same. It's in the blood.

1111
01:53:48,143 --> 01:53:50,351
Our bad time that you got
the right chance to blame us.

1112
01:53:50,893 --> 01:53:53,226
It's not yours. It's our bad time.

1113
01:53:53,309 --> 01:53:55,601
My daughter suffered with you.

1114
01:53:55,893 --> 01:53:58,393
And she would have been
suffering with your son-in-law.

1115
01:53:58,685 --> 01:54:02,309
Bloody doctor! 'He came in huge cars'.

1116
01:54:02,393 --> 01:54:05,184
'He clean big teeth'.
This is what you said, right!

1117
01:54:05,393 --> 01:54:07,101
It didn't even last for three days.

1118
01:54:07,143 --> 01:54:09,226
Dear mother-in-law... I beg you to stop!

1119
01:54:10,601 --> 01:54:12,143
I feel bad for your old man!

1120
01:54:12,226 --> 01:54:16,435
Yeah. That very old man has many
hopes for his granddaughter's marriage.

1121
01:54:16,601 --> 01:54:20,143
But what did you do?
You almost got her married to a fool.

1122
01:54:20,184 --> 01:54:23,101
That's your level.
Everyone knows about it.

1123
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:25,518
We should have it written in our fate.

1124
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,226
His Highness should step off
the throne to marry our Rani.

1125
01:54:45,059 --> 01:54:47,435
Rani... Did I make a mistake?

1126
01:54:49,685 --> 01:54:51,393
-No, dad!
-God!

1127
01:54:53,309 --> 01:54:54,934
It all started with this accident.

1128
01:54:57,601 --> 01:54:59,601
I don't even want to call you here.

1129
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:01,268
Your studies will get disturbed.

1130
01:55:02,852 --> 01:55:06,810
Your dad disturbed your studies and
made you take all this suffering, right?

1131
01:55:07,852 --> 01:55:10,435
No no... I'll get the tickets booked.

1132
01:55:10,726 --> 01:55:13,268
You pack your bags.
Go back to your college, Ok?

1133
01:55:14,101 --> 01:55:15,726
You should study well, Ok?

1134
01:55:30,268 --> 01:55:33,017
What? Did you have your dinner?

1135
01:55:41,393 --> 01:55:42,893
-I did.
-Hmm...

1136
01:55:57,643 --> 01:56:00,393
When I sit on the cement
slab in front of the house...

1137
01:56:01,101 --> 01:56:02,435
The people who pass by...

1138
01:56:03,184 --> 01:56:06,268
They say, 'We keep seeing your
son at their house all day'.

1139
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,101
Yeah. Even I observed.

1140
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:14,768
You are leaving early in the morning
and coming back in the night.

1141
01:56:15,143 --> 01:56:16,810
-Dad that's...
-No no.

1142
01:56:17,184 --> 01:56:18,852
I don't mean that you did the wrong thing.

1143
01:56:22,101 --> 01:56:25,393
No matter how good a son is,
a father will see him only as a fool.

1144
01:56:26,268 --> 01:56:29,852
Because at your age,
we too are as foolish as you are now.

1145
01:56:31,476 --> 01:56:34,393
But you have been so
consistent about that girl!

1146
01:56:37,768 --> 01:56:42,059
Just as consistent as you'll be when
you do something your mom asks you to.

1147
01:56:44,393 --> 01:56:45,726
I saw the girl.

1148
01:56:46,184 --> 01:56:47,309
She's beautiful!

1149
01:56:48,309 --> 01:56:49,768
Very beautiful!

1150
01:56:52,435 --> 01:56:53,685
What's with that dealer?

1151
01:56:55,143 --> 01:56:57,976
He points at the driver and
says that he's his son-in-law.

1152
01:56:59,768 --> 01:57:01,017
I feel bad.

1153
01:57:03,101 --> 01:57:04,143
So bad.

1154
01:57:06,268 --> 01:57:07,601
Shall I go sit with him and talk?

1155
01:57:11,852 --> 01:57:12,976
Why not?

1156
01:57:14,059 --> 01:57:15,518
Rani doesn't like any of it, dad.

1157
01:57:17,393 --> 01:57:18,476
What?

1158
01:57:21,726 --> 01:57:23,309
She don't like you?

1159
01:57:26,017 --> 01:57:27,059
I can't say.

1160
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:29,017
You haven't asked her?

1161
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:32,685
Say something!

1162
01:57:35,143 --> 01:57:38,393
She's leaving tomorrow.
I have to drop her at the bus stop.

1163
02:01:49,335 --> 02:01:50,585
See you!

1164
02:02:04,502 --> 02:02:05,836
Thanks Raja.

1165
02:02:14,002 --> 02:02:15,669
You have been the same
since our childhood.

1166
02:02:18,335 --> 02:02:19,627
You only speak with your eyes.

1167
02:02:25,877 --> 02:02:27,669
You used to talk normally
with everyone else.

1168
02:02:32,128 --> 02:02:33,377
But never with me.

1169
02:02:38,585 --> 02:02:40,627
After leaving you with
a goodbye back then...

1170
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:44,669
It took me three and
half years to come back.

1171
02:02:51,128 --> 02:02:53,585
At that time,
it felt like I am going away from you.

1172
02:02:58,086 --> 02:02:59,335
But this time...

1173
02:03:00,544 --> 02:03:02,169
It feels like losing you.

1174
02:03:12,086 --> 02:03:13,210
I'll leave...

1175
02:03:48,627 --> 02:03:50,293
Rani, it's raining.

1176
02:03:50,919 --> 02:03:52,169
Get inside!

1177
02:05:18,252 --> 02:05:19,377
What happened?

1178
02:05:30,585 --> 02:05:33,293
Every single time you came close
to me and stopped...

1179
02:05:34,919 --> 02:05:36,502
Those words you wanted to tell me...

1180
02:05:37,711 --> 02:05:39,169
I heard them Raja.

1181
02:05:48,335 --> 02:05:51,293
But I never knew how to answer back.

1182
02:05:58,377 --> 02:05:59,502
I am just like you.

1183
02:06:02,293 --> 02:06:03,502
I only know how to love.

1184
02:06:05,794 --> 02:06:07,460
I have no idea how to express.

1185
02:06:11,961 --> 02:06:15,627
Even then, I picked up the courage to walk
to you and stopped right in front of you.

1186
02:06:18,585 --> 02:06:20,544
Can't you hear me?

1187
02:07:09,544 --> 02:07:10,919
Come back soon.

1188
02:08:11,169 --> 02:08:13,627
HIS HIGHNESS - HER MAJESTY
