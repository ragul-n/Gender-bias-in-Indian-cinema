1
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,071
Raidu, good news.

2
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,782
Your town tender has come to us

3
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:39,391
Rs 200 crore contract on a
mere 3 lakhs bid difference

4
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,723
Our Ganesh construction has got it

5
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:02,810
A Rs 200 crore road contract
and we missed out for a mere 3 lakhs...

6
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,213
to Ganesh constructions

7
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:13,086
We need that contract,
no matter what it takes

8
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,853
Boss, from this moment you may
think the contract is ours

9
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,958
He should not be allowed
to enter this town

10
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,168
Bash him and get me that contract

11
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,883
Where is your boss?

12
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,257
Who are you all? What do you want?

13
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,929
l am engineer Kumar speaking.

14
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,193
Someone has intercepted our
staff vehicle and are threatening us

15
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,461
Who are they? What do they want?

16
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,265
l don't know who they are
and what they want

17
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,709
Come soon sir!

18
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,744
Where are you now?
-15 Kms from our place

19
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:08,743
l'll be right there

20
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,553
Catch them! Don't spare them

21
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,940
Eashwar, you!
Are you alright?

22
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,445
l'm fine

23
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,846
When did you come from U.S?
How did you come here?

24
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,790
l was coming from the airport,
l saw thugs chasing women

25
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,222
How could l ignore that?
So gave them few thrashings

26
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,922
How come you are so trim?

27
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:26,268
lf l am obese it may not look nice.
lf you are thin it won't look nice

28
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,538
My company staff. l got a call
saying they had a problem

29
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,808
But you rescued them before l did
- Had he not come in time...?

30
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,417
Now that he's back
it's gonna be great!

31
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,753
Where is your beautiful wife
Mrs. Kailash Ganga?

32
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:45,548
She is here

33
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,958
Ganga...? Where is she?
She was right here

34
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,399
Scared me

35
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,696
Last year you introduced her to me
as your love

36
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,274
Wasn't she a reserved type?
So mischievous now?

37
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,843
lt's her mischief
that l like

38
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,648
Come, let's go home
-Go on, l'll come in my car

39
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,515
Mother is not happy with our marriage
nor with our venkatapuram trip

40
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,846
You must reason with her

41
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,882
l'll go and see father

42
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:42,336
Sir, l am a psychiatrist
only because of you

43
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,919
You brought up this orphan as
your own son. l can never forget that

44
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,452
Though you are not with us
you will always live in our hearts

45
00:09:59,198 --> 00:09:59,892
Mom, greetings

46
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,896
Come Eashwar...
so you find time to visit us?

47
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,263
After your last year visit
you didn't even make a call!

48
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,171
l don't care if you are
a great doctor

49
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,403
Don't worry, l am not going to
leave lndia for quite sometime

50
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,808
l will make you all happy
and l will also remain happy

51
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,983
You will make all those here happy.
But who will solve my problem ?

52
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,249
l will do it, don't worry

53
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,327
How did you say, what l had in mind?

54
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,360
That is his speciality

55
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,797
Looking at your face he would say
what is in your mind.

56
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,336
He is not a mere doctor,
he is also an expert mind reader

57
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,940
How else can he treat
confused psychiatric patients?

58
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,973
Shut up

59
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:49,643
Not a big deal. There is nothing
that cannot be achieved by practice

60
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,042
What makes you think that the people
there will cause problems for Kailash

61
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:58,383
ln his construction work?
-What do you know?

62
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:03,886
l wanted to reunite his father's family
by getting him married to his cousin

63
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,866
But if they find out that he had
a love marriage like his father...

64
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,395
they might do anything to this girl

65
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,493
You think it's funny?

66
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,564
None of you know about Akilandeshwari

67
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:21,144
Even her brothers are frightened of her

68
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,678
She is such a terror

69
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,383
She would surely harm
Ganga and take her revenge

70
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,112
l am not going to stay in their house

71
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,818
Then where?

72
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,428
l have bought the venkatapuram palace
l am going to stay there

73
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,202
What, mother?
-As a kid...

74
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,342
l heard lots about that palace
That is a dangerous place.

75
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,669
For nearly 50 years
no one came forward to buy that

76
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,010
Are you mad to buy that palace?

77
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,911
Don't worry about Kailash or Ganga.
l will ensure nothing happens to them

78
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:06,020
l shall leave for venkatapuram today.
My first task would be...

79
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,286
to meet your relatives and console them.
l'll also check the palace thoroughly

80
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,498
Later l will decide whether these two
should stay there or not

81
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,419
'Akhilandeswari House'

82
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,115
Dear, dear!

83
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,994
Have you ever called me lovingly?

84
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,631
You always alarm me! What is so urgent?
-Look! People and cars!

85
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,197
They are coming here

86
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:36,306
Come on in, sir.
He is a big textile businessman

87
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,601
They have come to seek
your eldest daughter Priya

88
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:43,177
My sister Akilandeswari takes
all decisions in this house

89
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:48,009
Though Priya is our daughter
she was brought up by my sister

90
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,184
l'll come after consulting my sister

91
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,818
Kasturi married my fiance, but now she
has forgotten the 30 year animosity...

92
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,998
and seeks my daughter for her son

93
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,396
So l have decided that he will be
my son-in-law

94
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,399
Okay sister.

95
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,037
Where is that businessman?
-They heard what sister said

96
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,077
All the cars have taken an about turn.
-ls it?

97
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:21,018
lt is 8 years since we are married.
ln all those l have not seen...

98
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,849
anybody from your uncle's family
-These families parted ways 30 years ago

99
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,026
This wedding will reunite them.
You'll see all of them

100
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,287
Come soon, come

101
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,903
Oh Lord!
Lord of Thirumaia!

102
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,778
Look at us

103
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:38,662
Our foik's hearts are diamonds.
Come on burnish it

104
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,467
When aii the powers are harnessed...

105
00:16:53,846 --> 00:17:00,445
this earth wouid turn a heaven

106
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,252
Think for a whiie

107
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,813
The tiiier wouid smear iegs in mud...

108
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,152
so that we can iay hands on our food

109
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,428
if those who ciean the drain...

110
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,498
go on ieave for four days,
the town wouid stink

111
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,605
if we don't have hairdressers...

112
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,368
how wiii our head burden reduce?

113
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,570
if there is no one to wash
ciothes in river water...

114
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,511
won't our prestige go ruin?

115
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,183
Which everjob you do,
work is worship

116
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,379
This was said by Brahmamgaaru

117
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,046
Let peopie say
anything about you...

118
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,552
just iisten through one ear
and push it out through the other

119
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,357
Even if the cioud floats
or the crow flies...

120
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,123
the sky won't get dirtier

121
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:34,132
Even if a baii is immersed in water
it wouid float...

122
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:41,537
Even if you are sideiined
come on up, iike a flower baii

123
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,978
Can the crescent
changing to a fuii moon...

124
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,415
be prevented by giow worms?

125
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,753
Superb

126
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,674
We don't know when and
how son-in-law is coming

127
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,612
Who let that bullock cart in?

128
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,047
Who is that?

129
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:01,754
Stop, stop! l say, stop!

130
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,188
You don't pay heed to
a respectable man!

131
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,524
Don't l look like a man?
-No, no

132
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,400
Who are you?

133
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,038
Why did you bring in a bullock cart?
We are expecting our son-in-law

134
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,935
From vizag, Kasturi madam's...
-Son-in-law!

135
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,713
We expected you by flight. And here you
come in a bullock cart, like a simpleton

136
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,815
Look, l'm not your son-in-law

137
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,220
Right. Not before the wedding

138
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,321
Are you joking?

139
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,399
l'm not your son-in-law. Well...
-Well, you are here now

140
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:47,796
Oh, how do l explain?
l'm Kailash's friend Eashwar

141
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,668
Before l could explain over the phone
the line got disconnected

142
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:58,472
Your mother called us and told us
to expect such excuses from you...

143
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:04,350
because you would be embarrassed
to stay in our home

144
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,821
My sister has taken Priya
to the Lord Shiva's temple

145
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,257
Son-in-law, stop lying now

146
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,662
Oh! You useless fellow

147
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,800
What are you looking at?
Burn the crackers!

148
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,513
Where is son-in-law?

149
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,145
My wife is also missing!

150
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,881
-Excuse me! l am scared
of crackers. -Me too

151
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,521
Where is she?

152
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,285
l feel you are like my sister.
-l also feel...

153
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,128
you are like my brother

154
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,794
What bloody feeling?

155
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,237
She is not the girl
you are going to marry

156
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,996
l have already married her
and she lives with me

157
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,740
lt is true we have been married
for 8 years and have no children

158
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,338
So don't shift your feelings
towards him, Swarna

159
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,212
What? You and Swarna don't
have children even after 8 years?

160
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,052
He read my mind!
Good Lord!

161
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,359
Simply gorgeous

162
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,726
Enough. l am telling you once again,
she is my wife

163
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,926
Son-in-law, if you talk to your uncle
he would talk for the whole day

164
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,105
Come here

165
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:34,374
l burst crackers for him,
but he drops a bomb on me

166
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,671
He is praising her too much.
-l will praise her!

167
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:41,148
Son-in-law, the bullock cart journey
must've been tiring

168
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,751
Go take a shower and rest

169
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,685
What, what is this?
-Brother, let us not have him here

170
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,158
For what?
-We don't need him here

171
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,854
lf you allow him to enter, we may
lose many valuables. Be careful

172
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,864
Don't blabber.
-Am l blabbering?

173
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,373
He is calling me over...
did he hear what l just said?

174
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,543
You don't like me
staying here, isn't it?

175
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,384
On my way here, l asked many people
about venkatapuram palace

176
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,385
Everyone was scared and
no one was prepared to help me

177
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,220
So?
-lf you take me to the palace...

178
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,993
l won't stay here, otherwise...
-Otherwise?

179
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,669
l will stay here.
-Oh no! l will take you there

180
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,032
But you should do what you say.
-l will say only what l do

181
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,573
Both are same. Shall we go?
Go inside, go!

182
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,079
Even the gate gives me the creeps

183
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,413
This is the venkatapuram palace.
Now that you have seen it, let's go

184
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,086
Take off your hands.
-Why? Do you want to ride in?

185
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,315
Come inside.
-Where?

186
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,849
Come on!
-Buddy, l'm not going inside

187
00:24:54,626 --> 00:25:00,428
l won't go inside, l swore to you!
lt's not fair to force an elderly person

188
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,430
Had l told you, you wouldn't have come.
That is why l'm forcing you

189
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,263
So informal?
-Right

190
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,439
No good showing respect
to a cowardly old man

191
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,438
l won't go, even if you abuse me!
-Who stays here?

192
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,769
l won't tell.
-Swarna!

193
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,277
A gardener and his grand daughter!
-Really? So why are you so scared?

194
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,279
They don't stay inside palace.
-But we're going in

195
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:24,615
You may go in! l'll go back home.
-Why is that rope and log hanging there?

196
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,950
Painting work is in process.
-Then, are there painters inside?

197
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,786
Only one guy named Gopal.
He has been painting for a month

198
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:34,125
A guy staying here alone for a month,
but we both are scared to go in?

199
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,362
But he is from another village.
Had he known he would've fled

200
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,472
lt is so dark in here
even in broad daylight

201
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:49,704
Basavaiah, do you know the
history behind this palace?

202
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:56,381
Does it mean history?
lnmates of this palace fled 50 years ago

203
00:25:56,688 --> 00:26:00,647
Now some fool has bought it
and is having it painted

204
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,920
They can't hide what is inside
by painting the outside

205
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,498
Let us go now.
-OK, let us go

206
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,495
Not inside but outside.
Look, an elephant head

207
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,830
That is a buffalo's head, Basavaiah.
-Buffalo?

208
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,338
What do you think there is inside?
-Ghosts, they say

209
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,669
Fools.
-Evil spirits, they say

210
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:24,679
Cowards.
-A 30-feet snake, since 30 years!

211
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:29,183
That is why, that Gopal...
-A snake, really...?

212
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,686
He doesn't work here beyond 4 p.m

213
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:38,022
One day he boldly worked after 4 p.m...

214
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:42,689
And that day, things strangely
started breaking suddenly

215
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,029
Ever since, he leaves the palace
by 4 to 4:30 p.m

216
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,865
Why should a guy with
so much fear work alone?

217
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,534
Where is he?
Son in law!

218
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,540
He ditched me! Oh God!

219
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,550
He left me alone.
How will l go out ?

220
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:10,456
Send me out, Gopal
You will be blessed?

221
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,400
He came with me,
and ditched me, murderer

222
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,678
A lion!

223
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,127
Brother..
look at me

224
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:32,639
Say something...
please

225
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,802
Didn't l ask you not to take
him there? Just look at him

226
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,974
He looks like one of those big shots,
frozen with a smile while being arrested

227
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,551
What to do now?

228
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:01,764
Sister...? Why is there a crowd here?
What happened?

229
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,306
Greetings, l am...
-Where is our son in law?

230
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,537
Where is my prospective son-in-law?

231
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,708
When they said, you came by bullock cart...

232
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,878
l knew that you were not my son in law

233
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,050
-Because his son wouldn't come like that.
-You said it right

234
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:25,719
l tried to tell them
l am not the groom...

235
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,329
but they don't believe me

236
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,794
But you've understood it on your own

237
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:35,133
The groom has decided to buy
'venkatapuram Palace' in this village

238
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,408
He has sent me for that. l am his friend.
l've been brought up in his house

239
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,409
My name is Eashwar.
-lmpossible!

240
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:46,414
l won't allow him to buy
the 'venkatapuram Palace'

241
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,748
lt'll be dangerous for him to buy that

242
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,749
For my daughter too,
who will marry him

243
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,857
Well, lady. . .
l don't know how to say this.

244
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,252
His marrying your daughter...

245
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,761
There he comes

246
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,768
He resembles his dad

247
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,606
You? Son-in-law?

248
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,438
Priya, come here.
You wanted to see your fiance

249
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,676
He has arrived. Come and see him

250
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,021
Who's She?

251
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,688
She is Ganga

252
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:32,963
My wife

253
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,297
His mother wanted him
to marry your adopted daughter...

254
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,635
but due to certain circumstances,
Kailash had to marry Ganga

255
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,809
What is this? People from big families
asked for my daughter's hand...

256
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,311
but l didn't agree,
but you have deserted us

257
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,043
Marriages and alliances are decided
by destiny. How can we control it?

258
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:59,153
What a knowledge at such an young age?

259
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,493
You are intelligent irrespective
of your age. Shake hand

260
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,991
Let it be

261
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,164
My marriage definitely would have
hurt you

262
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:12,166
But l've come here only to
see you all. Pardon me

263
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,668
-We shall leave now.
-Where?

264
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:19,173
l've bought 'venkatapuram Palace'.
We shall be staying there

265
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,341
You mean THAT palace?
Please don't

266
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,174
-Why? -l went to see it,
and l got a shock

267
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,179
lf you buy it,
you'd be inviting trouble

268
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,682
Uncle, you are all elderly,
this is what you believe

269
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:34,189
Listen to me. Just like my uncle,
you also married an outside girl

270
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,520
However, l won't allow you to stay
in such a dangerous place

271
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,688
Uncle, before coming here
Ganga and l visited that palace

272
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,198
Nothing is scary over there like he said

273
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:50,034
Don't mistake me, l've been a gardener
in that palace for 40 years

274
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:54,371
Even l've not gone inside that palace.
Please think and act

275
00:31:54,579 --> 00:32:00,711
l've bought that 50-crore worth
property for 5 crore rupees...

276
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,886
l know that people believe that
it has some problems

277
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:08,386
But l don't believe it. l want my wife
Ganga to be the owner...

278
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,391
of a palace instead of just a house.
That's why l bought it

279
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,724
ln case of any problems, we'll deal
with it. You don't worry

280
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,059
Go stay there

281
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,998
You may go and stay in that house

282
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:30,680
Why do you stare? l stood against buying
that house. Are you wondering...

283
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,576
why l am asking him to stay there?

284
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,412
Not only them, but all of us
are going to stay there...

285
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,490
until his contract gets over.
-Oh God!

286
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:48,258
lf both of them go there alone and
something happens to them...

287
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,435
his mom will mistake me thinking that
since he didn't marry my daughter...

288
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:57,935
we had sent him there
despite knowing everything

289
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:04,775
Hence all of us will go and stay there
until everything is solved

290
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,282
Correct.
-Nice of you. Let's get her blessings

291
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,113
No, Kailash
-Why?

292
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,288
Not now

293
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:19,521
Complete the contract,
then we all can get her blessings

294
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,982
All these poojas won't be
effective in this palace

295
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,819
l've come along only to see your end

296
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,762
Now that you have come,
just watch what happens

297
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:02,833
Kailash, we are not staying
just because sister asked us to

298
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:08,001
l don't want you two to stay alone and
get into trouble, that's why l agreed

299
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,841
We would stay here till the end
only on one condition

300
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,518
Tell me, what is it?
-On no account...

301
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,347
should anyone go to the stairway behind

302
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:24,127
Specifically no one should go to
the room in the southern corner

303
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,530
You have decided to stay with us with
your family. Won't l do at least this?

304
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,703
We shall stay away from
that place for sure

305
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,600
Now l am happy

306
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,473
Oh God! What would l do?

307
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,045
Why do they buy trouble
and decorate it nicely?

308
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,717
l shouldn't stay alone in the house.
l should always be with the others

309
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,945
Basavaiah!

310
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:56,484
Such a beautiful name. Why do you
call it in such a scary manner?

311
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,961
Why do you create trouble?
-l have a sore throat

312
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,491
l forgot to ask, what is
your zodiac sign?

313
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,070
Why?
Just tell me

314
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,832
Leo.
-Leo, really?

315
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,070
Only one in a crore will
have this zodiac sign

316
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,247
You are lucky

317
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,312
Ghosts love that sign!

318
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,091
Does it take so many people
to lift one cot?

319
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,426
This is not any ordinary cot?
lt is an antique

320
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,263
Made of Burma teak. lt takes
more than 2 people to lift it

321
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,440
Bring your wife and come quickly

322
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,542
We are going to visit the family deity.
lt's your dad's temple

323
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:51,271
ln a bullock cart with the groom

324
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,450
Why all of you are
coming in a bullock cart?

325
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:58,111
Sir is a doctor in the U.S, he likes
to go only in a bullock cart

326
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,792
Mercedes Benz is fine, but
the bullock cart has its own charm

327
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,621
Well said
-Ramaiah, what are you doing here?

328
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,287
My grand daughter is flying kites
with all the kids

329
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,797
So l am here with her
-Who is she?

330
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,132
That girl in a white sari
with black stripes

331
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,710
l did kite flying at a very young age
-Yes

332
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,479
Are you ready?
-Ready!

333
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,839
Parrot, fly

334
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,674
Peacock fly fly

335
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,349
Myna fly fly

336
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,142
Oh Mind! fly

337
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,684
My Kite, fly away

338
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,956
Fiy iike a swan

339
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,361
its oniy the sky

340
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,697
No bounds, fly

341
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,034
The flying kite can confront any rivai

342
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,711
This is super star's kite!

343
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,589
Pray Goddess Meenakshi...

344
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,426
and ask money for the poor peopie

345
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,429
Pray Lord Kaiiashanath...

346
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,164
Give River Ganga which
requested by Teiugu Mother

347
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,773
You don't have any rivai
Like a Fuii moon...

348
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,106
Fiy and dance as you wish

349
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,614
The wind is now favourabie to us

350
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,117
Open your wings and fly over the sky

351
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,621
The sharpened kite flying thread...

352
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,952
now, you don't have any fear

353
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:53,350
Think about the persons
who heiped you to fly on the sky

354
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,526
Even if you mingie in the stars...

355
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,753
..you have thread support!
Carry on

356
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,363
it is no magic or mesmerising
you haven't read any vedas

357
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,764
but you the way to go heaven

358
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,370
Without doing any Pooja
you have born with biessings..

359
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,873
..who made you this iucky?

360
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,377
With desires at heart.....

361
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,549
has your mind shown that way?

362
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,934
Priest, this is my nephew Kailash

363
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,437
He has bought the venkatapuram palace

364
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,211
Everyone is scared when a mention
is made about the palace

365
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,449
What is there? What happened?

366
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,346
About 100 to 150 years ago...

367
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,286
King venkatapathy lived in that palace

368
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:38,019
He used to make a peculiar noise
when he arrives

369
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:43,627
He would do anything to attain his goal.
He was such a brutal man

370
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:49,629
Once when he had gone to
Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu...

371
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:54,307
he met a dancer called Chandramukhi

372
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:59,973
He was lured by her beauty and
wanted to make her his mistress

373
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,479
But Chandramukhi did not agree

374
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:08,989
Because she already loved
a dancer called Gunasekar

375
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:15,325
Even after knowing that, the king
abducted her against her wishes

376
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,661
Chandramukhi without the knowledge
of the king...

377
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:26,173
made Gunasekar stay in
a nearby house and met him stealthily

378
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,507
The King came to know about this.
On a Durgastami day...

379
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:37,844
the king killed Gunasekar
right in front of her...

380
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,024
in the banquet hall of the palace,
and he burnt her alive

381
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,683
Chandramukhi had an untimely death
not doing anything wrong

382
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,523
Her soul wanted to avenge the king

383
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:52,191
The king knew about this and brought all
sorcerors from all over the country...

384
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:58,035
and conducted prayers and sealed
Chandramukhi's ashes in a pot

385
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,042
He kept the pot in a room at the southern
corner of the palace and locked it

386
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:07,707
After some years the king also died.
But Chandramukhi's soul...

387
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:12,048
is still waiting in that room
to avenge the king

388
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:18,889
lt is said that there is a
king cobra there too

389
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:24,223
Nobody knows how much of this
is true and how much is not

390
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,173
12 o'clock? This is the time
at which the ghosts come out

391
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,113
They have all left me alone.
ls it a bedroom?

392
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,283
lt looks like a big ground.
l accepted not knowing this

393
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,949
Now my heart throbs while l sleep here

394
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,453
Who is that?

395
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:21,954
Oh God

396
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,788
l didn't do it, l didn't do it

397
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,625
lt is me, Basavaiah

398
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:34,793
Why did you come at this time?
-Could not bear my wife's snores

399
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,974
At nights she walks like a devil,
she lies down like a ghost

400
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,302
From the day l heard the
priest's story l have lost my sleep

401
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,536
Let us hug together and sleep here

402
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,883
No.
-Expected. Are you not a doctor?

403
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,814
Please clarify my doubts.
-What Basavaiah?

404
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,650
Do ghosts exist?

405
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,157
Have they ever seen one?

406
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,330
Should l believe it or not?
l want to know this

407
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,831
Why do you turn so often?
lt seems the priest is better than you

408
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,100
Do ghosts exist? ls there any
indication of a ghost coming?

409
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:18,007
There are typical indications.
-Like?

410
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,683
A fox howls at a distance

411
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,185
Really, l can hear the sound there

412
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,362
Did l ask?
-No

413
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:38,524
The breeze blows wild,
the trees sway...

414
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,369
the windows rattle...

415
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,036
l can hear this sound there

416
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,878
Did l ask?
-No

417
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,879
A faint smell of jasmine...

418
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,710
Jasmine!
-Why are you shouting?

419
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,376
Ok, the wind will carry jasmine smell

420
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,723
Yes l can smell the jasmine fragrance

421
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,053
Did l ask?
-No

422
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,561
Just hear the story, no cross questions

423
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,561
lf you do... what is this?
-Adam's apple

424
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,169
l will pluck it out

425
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,504
Then...

426
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,901
What?

427
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,075
What?
-Anklet

428
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,418
Oh God l hear the anklet sound also

429
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,746
Did l ask?
-No

430
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:37,185
Then a smoke like image in
white attire comes up

431
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:44,256
lt's showing up!

432
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,663
Where?
-There

433
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:55,943
Why do you laugh like a woman?
-Not l. The ghost is laughing

434
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,273
Where?
-There

435
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,216
lt's gone

436
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,952
You have mistaken my grandpa's dhoti
swinging in the wind for a ghost

437
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,689
Have you not learnt anything?
-Me scared?

438
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,798
Me?
-Yes

439
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,799
Basavaiah and l were rehearsing
for a drama. What is you name?

440
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,634
Why?
-Just to know

441
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,310
Durga.
-Oh gosh

442
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,478
What?

443
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,707
What an arrogant girl.
l will take care of her later

444
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,649
lt's all because of him

445
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,987
He damaged my image
before a beautiful girl

446
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,251
Having done all this
see how he is sleeping

447
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,277
Stop it!

448
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,291
What is this?
Early morning can't you find...

449
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,361
any other place to teach music?
lt has become a big nuisance with you

450
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:26,097
At nights you walk with anklets,
laugh frighten us, and ruin our sleep

451
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,203
Early morning you sing and wake up
all the those who are sleeping

452
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:35,773
This is not right. l came here
to rest, l have lost my peace

453
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:43,379
Kids, why do you scream like this?
Go, watch good movies in Tv

454
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,222
Look here, Darga...
-Durga!

455
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,396
lf you want to teach music,
go to a temple...

456
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,328
or school, or a hall or river side
don't do it here

457
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,901
My friend has bought
this palace shelling out crores

458
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,073
ls this palace meant for you
to teach music?

459
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:09,075
No, change your location tomorrow.
lf l hear the sound again...

460
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,908
l will drive you and
your grandfather away

461
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,574
Look, what ever you do, the
music classes will be held right here

462
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,482
From tomorrow it would be more noisy

463
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,084
lf you have decided to go
from this house what can l do?

464
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:26,422
lf l am to forgo my music
l don't want to live in this place

465
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:32,432
She's an orphan. A bit short tempered
but doesn't take anything to heart

466
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:37,437
Until you leave this place l will ask
her not to conduct classes here

467
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,938
l beg of you

468
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,729
Don't

469
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:15,634
You may be a modern girl and
would like to see what's up there

470
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:20,639
But in such matters
you should listen to elders

471
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:21,882
Come downstairs

472
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:34,895
Who is that?

473
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,231
You?

474
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,768
What are you doing here
at this time?

475
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:45,004
l couldn't sleep so l thought l'd
come here for some fresh air

476
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,232
Love?

477
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,845
Are you in love?
-How do you know?

478
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,573
lt is evident from your face

479
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,850
The day your dad asked you
to come and see your groom...

480
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:02,185
you were unperturbed and calm.
l knew then itself you were in love

481
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,859
Tell me, who he is?

482
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,524
viswanath. Dance professor.
He lives there

483
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:13,601
l see. Good selection.
-Do you know him?

484
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:20,704
l know him, l also know who
made him stay in that house

485
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,212
Have you expressed your love?
-Yes

486
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,540
What did he say?
-He asked my dad to come

487
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,216
Didn't you tell him about it?
-l am scared

488
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,215
Then how will your love succeed?
What's your dad's name?

489
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,614
Krishnaswamy

490
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,721
Your daughter is in love here,
and you are sleeping?

491
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,787
Hey Mustache!

492
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,892
Oh God

493
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,405
Why are you here at this hour?
-Nothing, just came for some fresh air...

494
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,506
Fresh air? Get lost

495
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,916
What are you doing here at this time?
-Alliance

496
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,415
Alliance?
-Ok, research

497
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,519
Research?
-Love

498
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,757
First this doctor should be
driven out of the house, isn't it?

499
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,329
l told you this that day itself.
You are late

500
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,099
He is interested on that girl.
My wife is saved

501
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:26,333
A bachelor has one worry, whereas
a married man has many worries

502
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,274
Look here

503
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,114
1001st worry

504
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,955
He's just so accurate...!

505
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:53,630
Grandpa, it's 9 o'clock and yet
no one has come

506
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,897
They won't come.
-Why not?

507
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:01,304
Baby is here.
Where are the others?

508
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:06,972
The uncle who scolded you yesterday,
gave us money...

509
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:13,248
and asked us not to come for classes.
He asked us to go and watch a movie

510
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,987
Until he goes back it would be better
not to conduct music classes

511
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,496
Durga

512
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:35,171
Because you don't like me
teaching music...

513
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,608
you stopped them from
attending the classes?

514
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,509
You can only give them money
and send them for movies

515
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,677
But can you buy music
with your money?

516
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,413
l have already bought it

517
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,527
My harmonium?
-l bought all these instruments

518
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:04,105
Except this box. Your grandpa
gave me this trivia, free of cost

519
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:14,147
Music is like Saraswathy

520
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,549
lt's in the blood by birth

521
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:28,754
Arrogant people like you will not
understand its importance ever

522
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,794
You will never...

523
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,435
understand! You...
-Look here Darga

524
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:38,964
Don't curse me, it might come true.
Not for the sake of this box!

525
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,507
You may take it.
-This one?

526
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:46,944
l won't touch the harmonium
used by you

527
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,998
Beautifui sky has danced...
Oh doii!

528
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:44,699
This is a iuiiaby by God.
Oh doii! Listen!

529
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:48,469
it's the song that pervades

530
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:52,307
This song aiso has given by Lord Shiva

531
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,144
i kissed Lord Shiva's foot!

532
00:55:56,353 --> 00:56:01,313
He had kept me in peopie's heart

533
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,801
River flowing sound
in a rainy season...

534
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:58,311
..you can hear the river meiody

535
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,774
Jasmine buds...

536
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:08,550
..gentiy attunes meiody

537
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,885
Music must make one dance...

538
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:14,154
and music must make one hear

539
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:23,730
Music shouid touch our hearts
it wouid make us to touch the sky

540
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:29,742
Hearing this music the earth
wouid aiways orbit

541
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:21,790
Tying iittie cradies a mother's
iuiiaby is aiso music

542
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:27,000
Man and woman on cot
attuning meiody of desires...

543
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:31,799
is the music of iove

544
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,306
Universe is fiiied with wonders

545
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,503
it wouid be a worry
if you don't know that?

546
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,487
You and me are....

547
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,053
..nothing in front of the God

548
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:53,628
There's no one who knows everything

549
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,434
Fantastic! You were wonderful

550
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:45,842
You have made us dance.
-He does everything nicely

551
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,885
What do you think about Eashwar?

552
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:55,782
At a time...he can answer 10 different
questions posed by 10 different people

553
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,893
He's not an ordinary man.
He's extraordinary

554
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:04,398
What are you watching?
Go inside

555
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:10,171
Why do you look there?
-Super style

556
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,543
A Wiseman does not require advice

557
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,911
A capable man does not
require advertisement

558
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:28,387
Through your song
you have taught me a lot

559
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,487
Forgive me

560
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,296
A message for doctor Eashwar

561
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:50,276
You've got an e-mail

562
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,713
What happened?
-One of your patients is serious

563
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,887
Wants you to return.
-ls it a bad news?

564
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,386
ls it not? You said you will
stay here for a month

565
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,583
But within 6 days you
have been called back

566
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,187
Kailash, a doctor can wait
for the patient...

567
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,559
but a patient should not
wait for the doctor. l'm leaving

568
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:11,665
What Eashwar?

569
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:17,572
Eashwar will appear

570
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,951
Sir, l am leaving.
-Really? Take this

571
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:37,157
Now l am happy. Happy that
you're leaving so soon

572
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,590
Go ahead.
- Correct

573
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:44,159
You are happy that l'm leaving so soon

574
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,532
But l have finished
a 6 month's job...

575
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,035
ln...?
- ln just 6 days

576
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:59,538
The other day we talked about love.
Have you informed your dad?

577
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:00,545
Love?

578
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:05,114
Doctor, you left your specs in my room.
- ln your room?

579
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,887
l'll take that later.
Let me talk about Priya's love

580
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,254
How dare you talk about
my daughter's affair to me?

581
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:17,764
Who else should l talk to then?
Do you want me to say it all...

582
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,161
to all the magazines and press?

583
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:24,863
How can you fall in love with
a complete stranger? How dare you!

584
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:29,110
Don't get excited. l said she was
in love. Did l say with me?

585
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,644
Priya is in love with
dance professor viswanath

586
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:40,882
Yes. He is a good boy,
a right match for your daughter

587
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,991
The other day l was talking
only about this to Priya

588
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,626
Next day l talked to viswanathan.
With your consent...

589
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:53,166
he is prepared to marry Priya,
he said. So think about it

590
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,894
Don't lose a good alliance
on false prestige

591
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,903
However hard you try you may not
get such a good boy

592
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,201
Once the marriage is fixed
send me an invitation

593
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,039
lf required, your second daughter...
- l'll surely invite you. Please leave

594
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,545
Really?
- Really

595
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,551
l forget someone... yes, Swarna

596
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,922
l won't allow you to talk to my wife
even at the risk of my life

597
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,463
Look at his dress.
He is wearing the shirt inside out

598
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:28,228
lt'd be better to tear it to pieces.
- ls it your dad's property?

599
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,665
lt's my money, it's my dough

600
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:34,639
l may tear it, may not tear it.
What will you do?

601
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:42,411
This maid has such a sexy hip.
Bad timing! Not when he is around

602
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:48,250
What will l do? Tonight, somehow,
l am going to get her

603
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,449
This is too much
- What?

604
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,686
Too much. -What?
Swarna...

605
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,494
The chicken... -He asked
for chicken, l didn't buy

606
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,964
So he wants to complain about me.
-You see...

607
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:04,469
Sir, Rajathi Raja, Arunachala
Narasimha, Dhalapathi, Muthu brother...

608
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,508
You may leave! Don't break
a happy family

609
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:11,145
You may leave

610
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:15,579
-What did he say? -Nothing.
He wants us to eat chicken

611
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,747
What?
-A small story

612
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:18,943
Tell me and leave

613
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:23,954
This guy cannot even stand up...

614
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,688
but he likes to have 9 wives

615
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,592
Wait

616
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:35,532
Ganga, l forgot to tell you
l was leaving

617
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:39,003
You said one month, but you are
leaving in 6 days. Liar

618
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,540
You think disease comes with a notice?
What is this?

619
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,234
For you, to eat on your way.
-All this?

620
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:44,777
Yes, eat nicely

621
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,074
Do you know what is
the best medicine in world is?

622
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,510
What?
- Food

623
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,586
lf you eat to a limit it is medicine.
lf you over eat it is poison

624
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:04,925
Wherever l am, l keep people
around me happy

625
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:10,636
l did the same thing here also
but l was little excessive to you

626
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:16,000
lf you feel so, forget it

627
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,540
But don't forget me

628
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,017
Bye. May l...?

629
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,520
Sorry... bye

630
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:54,880
Durga come here,
want to talk to you in private

631
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:01,521
What Madam?- No formalities.
Call me Ganga

632
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,788
Ok Ganga, tell me what is it ?

633
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,859
l have a lot of old books with me.
l want to keep them in...

634
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:12,361
some room upstairs in the building.
Will you accompany me?

635
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,093
My God! Even my grandpa
doesn't go there

636
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:20,298
He has also asked me not to go there.
Because Chandramukhi's room is there

637
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:24,411
Old people have that fear.
Why should we fear? Am l not with you?

638
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,678
Let's go

639
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,581
Ok, you need not come, l am going

640
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,949
What about the people at home?

641
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:40,051
All have gone to meet viswanathan
regarding the alliance with Priya

642
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,966
ln that case l will come

643
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:51,802
l didn't love your daughter
for her beauty or status

644
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,606
l lost my parents at a young age

645
01:06:56,078 --> 01:07:00,538
But l wanted to live in a joint family,
so l accepted your daughter's love

646
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:06,145
That is quite understandable.
l also like the groom...you too like...

647
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:08,813
We have only seen the groom

648
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,853
Shouldn't we finalise the auspicious
dates for the ceremonies?

649
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,962
Sister, today is a good day,
we can finalise them today itself

650
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:20,128
My daughter's engagement should
not be held in a tiled house

651
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,460
lt should be done in the fort
and in a grand manner

652
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:25,538
l am glad that you have agreed

653
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:29,507
Coming 16th is an auspicious day.
Let's do it your way

654
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,017
l think this is the room

655
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,487
Why are there so many amulets?

656
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:25,059
150 years ago, prayers were
conducted here

657
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:30,368
Chandramukhi's spirit
is locked up here

658
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:32,168
Do you believe these stories?

659
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:33,606
Whatelse?

660
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:37,177
l think this room has valuable
jewels and diamonds

661
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,480
To prevent theft, these stories
must have been floated

662
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:46,144
lf l get the keys to this room
l would open and show it to you

663
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,487
This room has no key,
it has been lost

664
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:57,255
But my grandpa told me once... that the
key's mould is available with a blacksmith

665
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,591
We will ask the blacksmith
to make the key immediately

666
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,203
You own the house.
You tell him

667
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,574
lf you want, l will bring the key
after it is made

668
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:07,742
l will order right away

669
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,218
What?
- Here, the key to Chandramukhi's room

670
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,451
What?
- Please don't open this door

671
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,628
What happened?
- The guy who made the key...

672
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:17,562
has died vomiting blood

673
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:22,694
lf this is the end for the guy
who made the key...

674
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:27,264
what would happen to me,
who brought this key?

675
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:31,510
l'm scared.
- Yesterday when l placed the order...

676
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:38,051
he was drunk. A guy who drinks 24 hours,
would die whether he makes a key or not

677
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,487
lt's good he died
after making the key

678
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:44,486
Don't confuse yourself, be brave

679
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:53,461
You say the old man died because
he made a key for the southern room

680
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:56,229
But Ganga who went into the room
is perfectly alright

681
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:57,402
You are right.

682
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:04,639
Trust me. The old man
died of a rotten liver

683
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,949
l may sound funny... don't know, what
more is going to happen in this house?

684
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,924
Hoil? lt's a marwari festival, right?

685
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:09,268
Please call the ghost gently or else
it might harm us before it leaves

686
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,461
Hey! Wait...come with me.

687
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:45,704
Patience! Why is he jumping?
Don't shout! Go calmly

688
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,708
Okay...okay...
