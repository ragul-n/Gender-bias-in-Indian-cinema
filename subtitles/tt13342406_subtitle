1
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,708
Sherley can sleep peacefully  
 in any kind of tension.

2
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,791
Maybe because she's a  
 staunch believer in God.

3
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,708
I'm a believer too.

4
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,958
But I don't believe  
 in God enough

5
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,333
to hand over all my problems  
 to Him, and sleep peacefully.

6
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,041
In fact, what Chaachan  
 says is right.

7
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,625
You shouldn't worry about  
 things beyond your control.

8
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,291
But when one is about  
 shut shop due to debt,

9
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,875
how can one get sleep?

10
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,958
[phone ringing]

11
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,125
Hello Chaacha...

12
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,333
Hi dear...  
 Our KC Joseph sir passed away.

13
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,250
Oh no!  
 What happened?

14
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,916
I came to know  
 from the newspaper.

15
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,666
I need to go there  
 to know more details.

16
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,541
It's quite far, right?

17
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,333
Many people would come there.

18
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,416
It's risky for people  
 who are old, Dad.

19
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:50,958
Is that really necessary?

20
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,833
There aren't many infected here.

21
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,291
Joseph sir had given a  
 surety for our farm loan.

22
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,166
I need to meet  
 Jacobkutty and tell him.

23
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,416
Otherwise, they might get scared if  
 they get a legal notice or something.

24
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,458
I'll meet him, tell him  
 about this and come back.

25
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,916
When are you coming?

26
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,166
Where's Roy?

27
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,125
Royichayan is sleeping.

28
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,083
We have a lot of  
 work to complete.

29
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,541
And there's a lot of  
 packing to be done.

30
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,250
And a couple of things have to  
 be settled in the office too.

31
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,375
We might be able to  
 leave on the 17th.

32
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,666
If you leave on 17th,  
 you'll reach here on 19th.

33
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,958
You'll leave at dawn, right?

34
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,958
There won't be much traffic  
 because of the current situation.

35
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,791
We can't say anything in  
 this present situation, Dad.

36
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,458
Everything will happen  
 as per God's will.

37
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,833
Stop it.  
 Go away!

38
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,958
Hey! Don't trouble me!

39
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,458
Hey!

40
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,041
Hey!

41
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,583
Stop it!

42
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,708
Hey Sundaran...

43
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,041
Why are you troubling him?

44
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,416
You asked me to  
 come to buy fish?

45
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,250
I thought you were fasting?

46
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,166
I am breaking the fast, Chandran.

47
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,916
The pandemic is on, right?

48
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,041
And the children are coming too.

49
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,958
Sundaran!

50
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,708
Sundaran, you are here?

51
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,500
I looked for you everywhere.

52
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,708
Hey!

53
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,333
Sheeja is calling you, right?  
 Go.

54
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,500
Sherley will reach on 19th.

55
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,666
- Sheeja!  
 - Coming, Mom!

56
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,875
- What about Sophie?  
 - She will also come.

57
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,458
The house will become lively then.

58
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,125
- Is the Mackerel fresh, Chandran?  
 - I'll be a little late.

59
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,833
The Kili fish is more fresh.

60
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,833
Okay. Give me half a kilo.

61
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Thank you.

62
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,833
Got it?

63
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,500
Shaji was saying...

64
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,625
... that we should  
 take all our documents.

65
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,125
It's a big bunch.

66
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,666
We'll have to search  
 through the entire thing.

67
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,833
Sit, no?

68
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,083
Do we have the papers of our  
 apartment in Andheri with us?

69
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,333
That's with Shiny. She's doing the  
 rent collection and stuff, right?

70
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,000
Did you tell Shiny  
 that we're leaving?

71
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,208
No point saying that  
 she's this sister of mine.

72
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,625
It's really difficult to  
 say something to her now.

73
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,375
Melissa is her current  
 best friend, right?

74
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,333
She shouted at me the other day  
 saying that I caused my own divorce.

75
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,833
Until a sale happens, we don't  
 really need any of those papers.

76
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,416
And I think it's still in Papa's name.

77
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,500
Oops! It's 9 o'clock already?

78
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,291
I had told Sophie  
 that I'd call her.

79
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,583
When I opened my eyes,  
 there were people all around me.

80
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,791
I felt really ashamed.

81
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,166
I closed my eyes again.

82
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,291
Hi Momma!

83
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,583
Angela went home yesterday.  
 Her Daddy had come.

84
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,583
What about Merin?

85
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,208
Merin is here. Merin's  
 parents couldn't come.

86
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,750
They've stopped all  
 the flights, right?

87
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,208
How do you know all this?

88
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,208
It was on the news!

89
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,041
We saw it on TV at the  
 recreation room in the evening.

90
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,166
When are you coming?

91
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,541
We might be able to  
 leave on Tuesday.

92
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,791
If you leave on Tuesday,  
 when will you reach here?

93
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,208
If we're able to reach  
 Chaachan's place by Thursday,

94
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,250
we'll be there on Friday.

95
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,875
What did you eat in the morning?

96
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,583
Dosa, Sambar, Chickpeas Chutney.

97
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,583
And some fish pickle  
 by Sister Alphonsa.

98
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,000
- Where's Royichan?  
 - Here.

99
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,333
- Hello!  
 - Royichan! What are you eating?

100
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,375
I am also having Dosa.

101
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,375
But it's coconut chutney here.

102
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,166
Is it Ankita Aunty?

103
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,208
No. It's Santa Claus!

104
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,375
It's Nair.

105
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,583
Pass the phone to Sister, dear.  
 I need to talk to her.

106
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,625
Okay.

107
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,333
- Hello Sister.  
 - Hi Sherley.

108
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,375
- How are you?  
 - I am fine. How are you?

109
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,916
- Have you decided when you're coming?  
 - No. I....

110
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,916
- Nair, come in.  
 - No. I'm not coming inside.

111
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,333
There's a problem.

112
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,416
- From the Customs, or something else?  
 - Customs, indeed.

113
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,666
The consignment is from China, right?  
 That's the problem.

114
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,333
The order is to clear consignments  
 with medical invoices only.

115
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,708
Whose order?

116
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,208
There are no written orders, sir.  
 It's an oral instruction.

117
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,666
Around 400 containers  
 are stuck there already.

118
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,875
It's not so easy.

119
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,958
Say something positive, no Nair?

120
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,833
If it isn't released now,  
 Vyshak will also be in trouble.

121
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,041
He had told me.

122
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,333
You do something, sir.  
 Give me Five Lakhs.

123
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,416
We'll sort it out.

124
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,916
But Vyshak said Three?  
 Didn't he?

125
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,208
That won't be enough, sir.  
 We need to pay everyone, right?

126
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,208
It's a little risky.

127
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,208
- Is it this one?  
 - No.

128
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,083
- Do you want this one?  
 - No. Not that one.

129
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,166
I'll bring some hair buns then. You  
 had forgotten to take these last time.

130
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,125
I don't need all that, Momma.

131
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,375
Then which one is it?  
 I don't get it. Is it this one?

132
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,583
Not that, Momma.

133
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,500
It is heart-shaped.  
 Check in the other box.

134
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,458
Not that one.

135
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,625
Check below that.

136
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,416
It has small pearls.

137
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,666
Here's the heart.

138
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,916
- This one, right?  
 - Yes. Don't forget to bring that.

139
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,916
No.

140
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,875
Say thanks to Sister.

141
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,791
- I'll call you tomorrow.  
 - Bye.

142
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,416
How many days do you need, Nair?

143
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,458
It's the 15th today.

144
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,333
I'll get it released by 25th.  
 Is that fine?

145
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,208
As early as possible.

146
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,291
Okay then.

147
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,583
You gave him money?

148
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,083
He said he'll get  
 it released by 25th.

149
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,375
What are you looking at?

150
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:46,958
If there was no corruption,

151
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,458
the Government wouldn't have  
 allowed anything at all to happen.

152
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,541
Oh no!

153
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,666
Why is the Kanji's (gruel)  
 colour so weird?

154
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,291
The rice turns into  
 that colour when boiled.

155
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,958
I had washed it four times.

156
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,458
You wouldn't have  
 washed it properly.

157
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
What do we do now?

158
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,250
No. That's the  
 colour of the rice.

159
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,083
You should have seen the colour  
 on my hand when I washed it.

160
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,125
Why?

161
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,125
Have they added artificial  
 colour to the rice?

162
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,958
Maybe!  
 Who knows!

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
They can increase the price, right?

164
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,333
Couldn't you wash it properly?

165
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,625
What do I do now?

166
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,458
It's all right.  
 It's for lunch, right?

167
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
It will be all right once  
 you drain the water out.

168
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,666
It got late by the time I  
 finished cutting the fish.

169
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,125
If I don't keep it on the stove now,  
 by one o'clock...

170
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,125
Your diabetic Sir wouldn't be able  
 to eat by one o'clock then, right?

171
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,958
When did you start coming here?

172
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,625
Annamma died in '88.

173
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,416
Sherley was 8 years old then.

174
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,208
Ever since then,

175
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,750
I made the rice and curry,

176
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,416
packed it and sent her to school,

177
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,708
took classes at  
 the top of my voice,

178
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,291
and took care of all these  
 plantations promptly.

179
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,416
And you're teaching me  
 about time management?

180
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,916
Look!

181
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,083
You had the time to  
 chip it and eat it.

182
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,875
If you keep chipping like this, it  
 will come off when you grate it.

183
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,875
I come here for  
 Sherley Chechi's sake.

184
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,291
If you're shouting so much,  
 I'm not coming from tomorrow.

185
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,791
No.  
 You needn't come.

186
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,291
Come only if you  
 really wish to come.

187
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,500
I have other jobs to do!

188
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,291
Do it yourself!

189
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,625
Damn it!

190
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:55,875
'These nights, this weather,  
 this river bank,

191
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,666
... this gentle breeze'

192
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,958
It's been long since  
 Vasanthi stopped coming.

193
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,000
Now I am the Vasanthi here.

194
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,291
That's what!

195
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,125
Washing these clothes and  
 dishes is a never ending job.

196
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,833
Yeah!

197
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,541
There are many cases there too,  
 apparently.

198
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,166
Around 8 cases, I guess.

199
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,791
Yeah.

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,875
- You don't need this now, right?  
 - Yeah.

201
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,416
Just a second.

202
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,125
No, this is the old..  
 This is the old one.

203
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,375
No. She is safe there.

204
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,291
She's in the convent, right?

205
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,333
Frankly, this is the first time I'm feeling  
 good about leaving her at the convent.

206
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,416
My guilt has reduced a bit.

207
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:57,916
At least that's sorted.

208
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,083
One minute.  
 Ankita, where is this....

209
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,291
Vyshak is calling me.

210
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,500
I'll come there tomorrow.

211
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,208
We'll meet tomorrow and talk.

212
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,083
Okay. Bye.

213
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,125
Where are the other two?

214
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,708
- They had valid Visas.  
 - Here.

215
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,541
Okay.

216
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,500
What do we do with these?

217
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,208
I'll pack all this into a suitcase.  
 What say?

218
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,833
Why don't you take this car?

219
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,125
This one's better.  
 We have quite a lot of luggage.

220
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,250
So you calculated the mileage already?  
 Miser!

221
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,291
It's only a two-day journey, right?  
 Why do you need so much water?

222
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,583
Are you going to  
 start a shop there?

223
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,625
All this water will be  
 over with one 'Thoottu'!

224
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,625
Take this.

225
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,750
From here.

226
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Lock it.

227
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,166
Thoottu means?

228
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,750
Thoottu means...

229
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh! Loose motion!

230
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,208
This is even worse, dude.  
 - Oh! Okay.

231
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,708
That means you won't know when  
 it would start or stop!

232
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,750
Exactly!

233
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,333
You rascal!

234
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,833
Think about it once again.  
 It's on the 7th floor.

235
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,125
It's too difficult to climb.

236
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,500
It's dicey.  
 Let's climb up slowly.

237
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,791
What's dicey, man?

238
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,958
This is so messed up.

239
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,291
What's wrong in taking the lift?  
 We'll wear masks.

240
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,208
There's an old man where we're going.  
 It's risky.

241
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,333
Dude, how's this  
 Parasakthi's credibility?

242
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,333
It's a reputed company.

243
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,791
Why did you ask so?

244
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,375
Well.. For a vendor...

245
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,041
I mean, it's not a  
 huge bill or anything.

246
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,083
But I heard a news  
 that it wasn't cleared.

247
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,250
That Vikas Yadav's CA?

248
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,125
That guy who always craps in the bar.  
 He told me.

249
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,958
I don't think so.  
 Did he call you from the bar?

250
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,208
Look how you're climbing!

251
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,875
You've grown old!

252
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,625
Hey! Go and call your dad that!

253
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,833
I might look old.

254
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,916
But my youthfulness is still intact.

255
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,416
In what?

256
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,791
Hold this.

257
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,625
Please come.

258
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,958
They will release the funds as soon  
 as they get the consignment, right?

259
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,333
The amount is quite big.

260
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,083
Don't be scared.  
 This is not the first time, right?

261
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,166
Will you call Nair?

262
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,083
We'll have to pressurize him.

263
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,500
Once you leave from here, will you have  
 your phone and internet over there?

264
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,833
You idiot! We're going  
 to Kerala, not Timbuktu!

265
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,166
Everything is done through the phone  
 anyway. This will also be done like that.

266
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,166
You have too much anxiety!

267
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,083
Only I know my troubles!

268
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,583
Try to leave early anyway.

269
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,041
There will be heavy  
 traffic up to Vashi.

270
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,083
Should I leave this fridge on?

271
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,625
Yes, you should leave it on.  
 Its gas would be over otherwise.

272
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,583
When we went to  
 Lucknow last time,

273
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,958
we switched it off and went,

274
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,500
and had to fill gas  
 when we came back.

275
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,833
I'll leave some lentils inside.  
 What say?

276
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,083
Yeah. That would be good.

277
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,250
I'll go check.

278
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,166
There's space only for three in the car.  
 Two are extra.

279
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,041
Go take a bath.

280
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,291
Ankita...

281
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,333
Will you take the cheese  
 and stuff with you?

282
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,708
They won't last long.

283
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,750
Maximum one month.

284
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,083
Okay. Give it.

285
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,083
Okay.

286
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,750
- Ankita!  
 - Yes, coming!

287
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,333
Look at this stain.

288
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,416
Sophie had tried to make some  
 ice cream with acrylic paint.

289
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,041
Did you try vinegar?

290
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,708
Put it on top of the cot.

291
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,916
Keep the bedspread and  
 pillows out in the sun....

292
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,708
Brother!

293
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,083
Brother!

294
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,291
- Chaacha?  
 - Haven't you left yet?

295
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,916
No, Chaacha. We got late by the  
 time we packed everything.

296
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,708
I'll call you back.  
 Royichayan is waiting.

297
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,750
I'll call when we  
 reach Navi Mumbai.

298
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,833
Hold this.

299
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,833
This too.

300
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,125
And...

301
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,458
I'll go keep this outside.  
 The gardener will water it.

302
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,291
Coffee?  
 Keep the coffee here...

303
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,000
Is there too much moss, Bhasi?

304
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,041
Well...

305
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,958
We have to tie a  
 net to this pipe.

306
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,333
It would stay only then.

307
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,000
I should tie it myself, is it?

308
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,458
[phone ringing]

309
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:58,875
Hello?

310
00:22:58,916 --> 00:22:59,916
Yes, Chaacha.

311
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,208
Sherley is sleeping.

312
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,833
Are you driving?

313
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:03,916
Where have you reached?

314
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,041
We've reached a place  
 called Ankola in Karnataka.

315
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,458
Thought we'll sleep for a while.  
 We left in the morning, right?

316
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,833
Where have you stopped?

317
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,166
Is it safe?

318
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,958
Yes. There are vehicles  
 passing this way.

319
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's fine.

320
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,458
Then sleep for some time.

321
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,083
Call me when you wake up.

322
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,250
I will also catch some sleep.

323
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Okay, Chaacha.

324
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,791
[phone ringing]

325
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,833
Tell me, my brother,

326
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,083
my friend...

327
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,833
Where have you reached?

328
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,458
You are drunk.

329
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:53,666
We've crossed Ankola.

330
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,375
Dude...

331
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,958
The audits won't happen.

332
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,083
There's no one in the  
 accounts department.

333
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,208
Anywhere!

334
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,666
Are you saying that the problem created by  
 Corona would be solved by Corona itself?

335
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,791
Who knows!

336
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:08,875
In Italy...

337
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,250
In Italy, as soon as this  
 Corona spread began,

338
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,833
they imposed a  
 lockdown immediately.

339
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,250
There's a lockdown in Spain too.

340
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,500
This damn virus has  
 come from abroad, right?

341
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,875
They should have  
 shut everything.

342
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,500
In fact, they should have shut  
 everything earlier, in January.

343
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,166
Now it's going to spread like wildfire.

344
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,583
It will spread everywhere.  
 All over the world.

345
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,916
It will ruin everyone!  
 Economy....

346
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,416
Cut those corners neatly.

347
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:38,708
Reptiles would come otherwise.

348
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,791
For that, you just have  
 to sprinkle some kerosene.

349
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,375
If I sprinkle  
 kerosene in the field,

350
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,625
it's not good for the soil.

351
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,250
You just have to  
 pee there at times.

352
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,791
The smell would drive  
 the snakes away.

353
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,541
I didn't ask you to pee right away!

354
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:51,833
Cut it!

355
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,916
[Singing in Hindi]  
 'We will have a small house,

356
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:09,041
under the shade of the clouds'

357
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,583
'Hopes are playing the  
 Bansuri in my mind'

358
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:19,375
[The same tune in Malayalam,  
 playing on radio]

359
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:31,708
Sing!

360
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,208
Sheesh!

361
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:35,416
I don't remember the lyrics  
 of any of these songs.

362
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,208
By next June,

363
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,833
let's admit Sophie to a school in Bombay.  
 What say?

364
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,458
I will be in Bombay hereafter, right?

365
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,500
Chaachan doesn't have  
 any health issues now.

366
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,250
She'll miss her mother  
 badly at this age.

367
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,333
I know that really well.

368
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:23,375
If it goes on like this, I think only  
 home schooling would be possible.

369
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:30,458
Should we stop at  
 that petrol bunk?

370
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,083
No.

371
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,916
Do you want me to drive?

372
00:26:58,916 --> 00:26:59,916
No.

373
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,333
[car approaching]

374
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:41,958
Chaachaa...

375
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,458
No. We're observing the 'Break  
 the chain' campaign here.

376
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,041
We're fine, Chaacha. It's like we  
 were in quarantine for a while.

377
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,666
Not that. I don't  
 know about myself.

378
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,000
It won't spread like that!

379
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,458
- Where is she?  
 - She's sleeping.

380
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,583
- Come.  
 - Chaachaa...

381
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,833
I slept off.

382
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:08,791
What about me?

383
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,250
Did you drive till here, Roy?

384
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,500
I also drove for some time.

385
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,416
The bed is new.

386
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:35,750
- Are you hungry?  
 - No.

387
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,041
Go to bed then.

388
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,416
Yeah. We have to drive  
 tomorrow as well.

389
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,708
We have to bring her back, right?

390
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,750
Let us decide that tomorrow.

391
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,291
I heard that the  
 border might get closed.

392
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,958
She would be expecting us, right?

393
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,166
What do we do now?

394
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,083
They would have known, right?

395
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,541
Who knows how long  
 this would go on for?

396
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,458
The vehicles are being  
 sent back, right?

397
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:11,041
Wouldn't there be a possibility  
 to get a permission?

398
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,625
Let's try that way.

399
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,583
Ours is a genuine case.

400
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,041
Call her, Sherley.

401
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,208
She needn't be worried.

402
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,333
This is not official.

403
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,791
Everyone here is saying that the  
 locals are stopping the vehicles.

404
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,541
I'll draft the letter and mail it.

405
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,666
Thank you, Sister.

406
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,500
We'll come as soon as  
 the permission is ready.

407
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,125
Don't worry about  
 her being here.

408
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,166
She's happy.

409
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,500
She sleeps along with the nuns.  
 She's completely fine.

410
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,708
Well...

411
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,083
If you don't mind, can  
 you pass the phone to her?

412
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,833
She must be expecting us.

413
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,875
Why would I mind?  
 I'll put her on.

414
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,666
Have the children finished eating?

415
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,166
No. They are still eating.

416
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,458
Sophie...

417
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
It's your Momma.

418
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,625
Hi Momma.  
 Where have you reached?

419
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:58,083
Is it time for me to get ready?

420
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:02,125
Dear... We haven't left yet.

421
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,250
The border is closed, apparently.

422
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,750
Hello?

423
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,708
Yes, Momma.

424
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,166
I had said bye to Merin.

425
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,833
Hello? Sophie?

426
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,041
Yes, Royicha...  
 You're not coming now, right?

427
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,416
Who said we're not coming?

428
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,541
We will come.

429
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,000
We just have to get a permission.

430
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,500
With your heart necklace,

431
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,541
we'll be there soon.

432
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,833
- Some more?  
 - No.

433
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,708
Ponnamma Chechi's Sambar.

434
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,875
Yes. She made it specially  
 for her Sherleymol.

435
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,291
Try this, Royichan.

436
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:50,416
It's not like what  
 we get in Bombay.

437
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,916
There's Kaayam (afoetida) in it.

438
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,625
Nice!

439
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,041
Mom made this ginger curry  
 also, specially for you.

440
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,583
How is she doing now?

441
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,166
It's the same old story.

442
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,083
She won't stay at one place.

443
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,750
She has bought two goats now,  
 taking a loan from Kudumbashree.

444
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,750
Even my aunt was like this.

445
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,291
Now she's doing rounds of  
 hospitals all the time.

446
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,416
That's how it is when  
 people become old.

447
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,791
Look at him!

448
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,958
He tried to rear pigs in this old age.

449
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,791
And he ended up  
 losing a lot of money.

450
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,708
All the businesses that we start  
 may not become successful.

451
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:34,708
Right, Chaacha?

452
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,750
Tell them that!

453
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,000
Do they know anything  
 about business?

454
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,041
Don't you have to go today?

455
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,208
- The college is shut, Chechi.  
 - Enough.

456
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,250
I might have to go  
 if there are exams.

457
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,041
Royichaya, she's something else!

458
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,875
She takes a bus at dawn  
 and gets down at Kottayam,

459
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,708
and takes the 8:15  
 train to Thripunithura.

460
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,791
And the same journey  
 back in the evening.

461
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,041
Won't it get really late by  
 the time you get back home?

462
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,833
There's a straight bus  
 to come back, Chechi.

463
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,041
So I come back early now.

464
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,000
Why don't you stay  
 in the hostel?

465
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,916
That won't be possible.

466
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,750
That's how it is.

467
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,041
She has to survive, right?

468
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,041
Isn't it, dear?

469
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,958
Aww! So much love!

470
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,916
Yeah, Chechi. He keeps  
 finding faults otherwise.

471
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,916
How come the love  
 is just flowing now?

472
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:22,458
This is so salty!

473
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:51,708
'Home, this home is a permanent refuge'

474
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:59,041
'The heart of my world, where  
 everything comes together'

475
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:10,958
'The burning embers of its memories  
 are aflame in everyone, everywhere'

476
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:18,250
'Even while wandering far away,  
 it is a solace'

477
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:23,708
'Home, this home is a permanent refuge'

478
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,333
It's the Janata Curfew tomorrow.

479
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,500
The Prime Minister  
 called for it.

480
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,625
The Chief Minister  
 has also endorsed it.

481
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,375
To disinfect homes  
 and surroundings.

482
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,375
Sit down.

483
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,750
There must be a snake in there.

484
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,958
He can sense it through smell.

485
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,333
I'll shake it out.

486
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,750
Go there.

487
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,125
When it jumps, kill  
 it with one blow.

488
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Stand there.

489
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:58,333
Don't do it. Why do you want  
 to kill it, Chaacha? Let it go.

490
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,083
If I let it go,  
 won't it bite people?

491
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,541
No being would hurt anyone  
 unless we hurt them.

492
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,625
It's wrong to take a life  
 unnecessarily, Chaacha.

493
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,166
It's a sin.

494
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,166
What do I say!

495
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,333
Are you going to play cricket, Roy?

496
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:36,916
'Sweet days and bruises of yore  
 have become bygones'

497
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:46,166
'Some withered and some blossomed,  
 into meadows'

498
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:55,958
'O Dream! Wander day and  
 night, in pursuit of the flower'

499
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,041
'Until the little honeycomb of the heart,  
 is filled to the brim'

500
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,041
'Home, this home is a permanent refuge'

501
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:20,083
'The heart of my world'

502
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:11,416
[praying]

503
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,500
From 12 AM tonight,

504
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,458
in the entire country,

505
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,791
there will be a complete lockdown.

506
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,666
To save India!

507
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,833
To save every citizen of India!

508
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,791
To save you...

509
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,791
To save your family....  
 - Just a minute.

510
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,333
Sophie...  
 - From 12 AM tonight...

511
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,791
you shouldn't be stepping  
 out of your houses.

512
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,458
You must have seen the news, right?

513
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,958
Yes, we were watching it.

514
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:09,541
The permission was almost ready.

515
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,291
That's when...

516
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:12,833
[indistinct]

517
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:13,958
What is it, Sister?

518
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:15,916
Just a second.

519
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,666
[phone ringing]

520
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,750
This is indeed a kind of curfew.

521
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,291
Dude, you saw the news, right?

522
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:34,708
I had told you, right?

523
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,833
And yeah, I spoke to Nair.

524
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:41,333
He said that getting our job done  
 during the lockdown is doubtful.

525
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,583
They can't stop it altogether, dude.

526
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,750
The Government runs on taxes, right?

527
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,208
When there's no money,  
 they will figure out some way.

528
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:50,625
The money should come, right?

529
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,250
Corporates should allow it, right?

530
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,083
They are the ones running this...

531
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,791
It's only a matter  
 of few days, right?

532
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,583
I am okay here.  
 Merin is here, right?

533
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:00,583
Don't worry, Momma.

534
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,333
Okay, dear.  
 I'll call you tomorrow.

535
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,666
Okay. Good night.  
 - Huh?

536
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:07,541
Good night.

537
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,166
Is she upset?

538
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,458
She ended up consoling me.

539
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:27,833
Vaishakh had called.

540
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,875
Nair says it is doubtful now.

541
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,083
Vaishakh is hoping that the  
 audit won't happen immediately.

542
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,791
But since everything is online now,  
 I think it might happen.

543
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,083
I didn't tell him that  
 when he called that day.

544
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,750
Why should I increase  
 his B.P. in vain?

545
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,125
Why are you late, Pavithran?

546
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,750
What do I say, Ittyavira sir?

547
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,125
The newspaper van was late.

548
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,125
Police have blocked all the roads.

549
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,500
They're not letting  
 any vehicle pass.

550
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,916
So this lockdown is for real?

551
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,041
Yes. There are cops  
 at our junction too.

552
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:25,250
The kids were planning to go to  
 Nagercoil to bring their daughter.

553
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,416
- Will it be a problem?  
 - Where? To Nagercoil?

554
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,458
No way!

555
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,208
Tamil Nadu border  
 was closed long back.

556
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,208
What do we do now?

557
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:34,416
Okay.

558
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,250
Cow dung is not available  
 in this country now.

559
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:50,833
Really?

560
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:56,041
Stop gaping and tie it!

561
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,041
Where is Roy?

562
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,833
I haven't seen him since morning.

563
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
He is inside.

564
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,000
If he's sitting idle,  
 call him.

565
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,375
Why should he stay alone?

566
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:06,875
Sherley!

567
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:12,416
He'll live long!

568
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,041
An audit is going on at Vyshak's office.  
 He got a mail now.

569
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:20,875
I knew this!

570
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,833
You could have told him  
 this back then itself.

571
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:25,208
It wouldn't have been  
 a shock for him now.

572
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,708
He got trapped trying to help us, right?

573
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,333
Sherley, you don't know the guy.

574
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,125
He would just fly off  
 the handle if I told him.

575
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,416
On top of that, he was  
 drinking when I called.

576
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,083
When he's drunk, he's a  
 different person altogether.

577
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,750
That is the guy I  
 can't deal with.

578
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,333
That's not possible, Roy.  
 It's mortgaged.

579
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:51,791
We mortgaged it during Willy's  
 mommy's bye-pass surgery.

580
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,666
Did it cost that much?

581
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:57,208
No. There were some  
 other issues as well.

582
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,333
Where's Willy?

583
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:00,916
He's here.  
 You want to talk to him?

584
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,541
No. I'll talk to him later.  
 Okay then, Shiny.

585
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:07,833
That's not possible.

586
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,583
The apartment's papers  
 are already mortgaged.

587
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,625
Mutual funds have crashed by 60%.

588
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,666
This one's not so bad.

589
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,208
This won't be enough.

590
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:00,541
Have some more rice, Roy.

591
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,083
Didn't you like the curry?

592
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,208
I had a heavy lunch.

593
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:06,625
So I'm still full.

594
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,541
Get some water for  
 the chickpeas, dear.

595
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:43,666
There would be situations in life,  
 in which we can't do anything.

596
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,541
We should learn to leave  
 it to God and stay calm.

597
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,291
You will get the permission soon.

598
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:53,500
She is staying with the nuns, right?

599
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,166
Why do you have to worry so much?

600
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:58,333
That's not the issue, Chaacha.

601
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:01,458
There are some other problems.  
 There's some tension about that.

602
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:02,958
What?

603
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,250
Any problems between you both?

604
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,000
No. There's nothing  
 like that, Chaacha.

605
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,958
Because of the lockdown,

606
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:12,791
one of Royichayan's consignments  
 is stuck at the dockyard.

607
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,583
He had borrowed some  
 money from a guy

608
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:17,833
thinking that he'll repay  
 it when it gets released.

609
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:20,250
He's a close friend.  
 They were schoolmates.

610
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,083
Now he's in dire need of money.

611
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:25,416
Is it a huge amount?

612
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,958
The amount is huge.  
 Around 2-2.5...

613
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,458
Crores?

614
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:34,291
Does he need it immediately?

615
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:36,958
Yes.

616
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,041
[phone ringing]

617
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,291
Yes, Ankita.  
 Tell me.

618
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,166
Is Roy near you?

619
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:18,625
No. He's sleeping.

620
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,125
What happened?

621
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,125
Nothing much...

622
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,958
Are there any issues going  
 on between Roy and Vyshak?

623
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:30,708
They always have some financial  
 issue or the other going on, right?

624
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,666
No. This time it's not like that.

625
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:35,083
I think the matter is quite serious.

626
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:39,541
The thing is... Vyshak and  
 I had a fight last night.

627
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,208
He was blabbering nonsense in anger...

628
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,750
and in between he started  
 speaking ill of Roy too.

629
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,916
He has been really worried  
 for the past 2-3 days.

630
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,541
I thought you guys  
 might know something.

631
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,208
There are so many problems  
 happening due to this COVID.

632
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,625
He must be in that tension.

633
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Leave it.

634
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,125
Old friends are like this.

635
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,666
They will fight today and  
 embrace each other tomorrow.

636
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,666
And the whole thing  
 will be blamed on us.

637
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,333
That's also true.

638
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,875
Then it must be something like that.

639
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,125
You don't have to worry.

640
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,250
Okay.

641
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:34,625
Dear...

642
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:36,916
Yes, Chaacha.

643
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,041
Sit down.

644
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:49,166
You know that I am in debt with that  
 pig farm loan and all that, right?

645
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,750
And quite a large amount  
 is yet to be paid.

646
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:57,541
I'm not as fit or  
 healthy as I used to be.

647
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,500
I've been thinking for a long time,

648
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:06,000
about clearing all my debts and  
 moving into a smaller setup.

649
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,208
How long will these  
 neighbours help me?

650
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,125
If I sell all this,

651
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,833
we can get around 4 to 5 Crores.

652
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,791
And there are new  
 apartments coming up here.

653
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,958
If I buy one of them  
 for 50 or 60 Lakhs,

654
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,625
it will be more comfortable.

655
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,125
It will be good for me...

656
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:28,541
... and you.

657
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:38,166
That's not necessary, Chaacha.

658
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:41,375
You built this house and  
 property on your own, right?

659
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,916
Your only asset.

660
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:47,375
Whatever it maybe for,  
 to sell it is like...

661
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,791
Why do we need assets if they  
 won't be of use during a necessity?

662
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,083
It's my need as well.

663
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,708
If God calls me back  
 when I am in debt,

664
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,875
all this would be  
 seized by the bank.

665
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:05,500
After 5 years,

666
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,458
will I be able to walk  
 through these fields like this?

667
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:11,708
And you all are in far away places.

668
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:16,416
This place would lie here, with  
 snakes, creepers and what not.

669
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,666
It will be wise to...

670
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:23,916
... move to a smaller setup which I  
 can manage by myself, hereafter.

671
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:31,208
I can't reach the corners of this  
 field even once a week, already.

672
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:35,875
People are stealing coconuts from  
 coconut trees near that canal.

673
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,750
What can I do?  
 Come.

674
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,583
Thieves are on the prowl.

675
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,666
In this situation,

676
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,708
all this would only increase.

677
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:54,625
What's the point in  
 keeping a couple of spikes?

678
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,333
Oops.

679
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,833
- What happened?  
 - I forgot to take the soap.

680
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,041
It's in the bathroom.

681
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,208
This forgetfulness!

682
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:06,791
Nothing is staying in  
 my memory nowadays.

683
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,333
This problem will only grow stronger.

684
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:13,625
My father was also like this.

685
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:17,208
And in some time, it would  
 be complete memory loss.

686
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,333
If it's an apartment,

687
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,250
I can manage everything with  
 the help of a home nurse.

688
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:28,083
You are helping us when we're  
 supposed to be helping you.

689
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,416
These are all God's doings.

690
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,291
What do we know of His plans?

691
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,458
Here.

725

728

 him a lot back then!

This guy is into building villas.

730

731

733

I'm not upset that the  
 house will be demolished.

735
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,916
Whoever I sell it to,  
 they might demolish it.

736

 behind the kitchen.

739
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:20,708
It was around 12 years back.

740
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:22,666
There would only be bones now.

741
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,875
But still, we should take it out and  
 burn it before we sell the place.

01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,875
The buyer is coming to  
 see the property at 11 AM.

866
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:04,416
We've advertised with the maximum  
 rate which we can get here.

867
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:06,625
But they would bargain, for sure.

868
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,958
Will our problems be solved  
 if we don't get that amount?

869
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:17,083
I saw on their website that many  
 of their apartments are completed.

870
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:18,875
We should ask that  
 when Binu comes.

871
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,750
Eat.

872
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:35,875
Do you remember me, sir?

873
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:37,916
How can I,  
 without seeing your face?

874
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,750
I'm not really sure.

875
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:44,041
You're from  
 Aanjilithoppu, is it?

876
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:45,500
No. It is 'Aanjilipparambil'.

877
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:47,916
You taught us Math in 8th grade, sir.

878
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,750
I was a little weak at Math.

879
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:51,500
You've caned me many a times.

880
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,333
So you would have been  
 really weak at Math.

881
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,541
Those days were different, right?

882
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:56,875
Come, let's see the place.

883
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,375
There was a pathway along  
 the boundary, long back.

884
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:13,791
It wasn't marked in the surveys.

885
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:17,166
The neighbours built a fence there.

886
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:20,083
That's how this 1.5 feet also  
 became part of this property.

887
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,458
My daughter and son-in-law.

888
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,041
You're Benny's brother, right?  
 - Yes.

889
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:25,333
We were classmates.  
 - Okay.

890
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:26,791
Is Benny still in the States?

891
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,125
No. He's in Texas.

892
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:29,458
He had come in December.

893
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,000
Some of these trees  
 have great wood.

894
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:41,250
It'll be useful for your work.

895
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,500
I liked the property, sir.

896
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:45,000
But the price you're  
 asking for, is quite high.

897
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:47,458
If we can arrive at a fair price,  
 we can move forward with an agreement.

898
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,333
It's a fair asking price.

899
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,666
Let's move forward anyway.

900
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:54,083
Right, Roy?

901
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,041
Come, Binu.

902
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:07,416
We sold that field in 2017.

903
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,625
- Back then, per cent...  
 - Royichaya...

904
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,500
Got it.

905
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,583
Sophie's medical certificate.

906
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:14,958
Look.

907
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:16,791
It was in my mail.

908
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,833
We have to apply in Tamil Nadu.

909
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:20,333
Through the Collector.

910
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,041
I'm so relieved.

911
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:31,166
But we need someone  
 to influence them.

912
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:36,500
Back when I was running around  
 for the pig farm,

913
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:39,708
a guy called Padmakumar helped me to  
 move my files at the Collectorate.

914
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:43,083
He's a big shot NGO guy,  
 whom I taught in school.

915
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:46,375
I wonder if he has  
 changed his number.

916
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:49,375
I'll get it anyway.

917
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,208
But how will he get the papers?

918
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:52,833
We can mail it to him.

919
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:57,083
This tree didn't really  
 bear fruit this year.

920
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:58,791
Last year...

921
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,541
Oh yeah! You had seen it, right?

922
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,458
Come, Royichaya.  
 Sit.

923
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:09,500
The fruit that we cooked last week,  
 was from that tree.

924
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,125
This is 'Koozha'.

925
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:14,083
If it's ripe, it's perfect  
 for 'Kumbilappam' (snack).

926
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,583
- You had a nap?  
 - Yes.

927
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:24,750
Ponnamma Chechi is  
 going to Kattappana.

928
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:28,958
I heard that they are discharging her,  
 because staying home is safer.

929
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:32,708
This is almost over.

930
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,250
I'll go give half of  
 it to Ponnamma Chechi.

931
01:11:37,708 --> 01:11:38,708
Stay here, Royichaya.

932
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:42,250
- Return that vessel also then.  
 - Okay.

933
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,125
We're moving forward with the sale.

934
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,000
You didn't say yes or no yet, Roy.

935
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:27,500
It's dangerous if  
 we don't dispose it.

936
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I...

937
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:39,041
I won't be able to do it, Chaacha.

938
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,791
You must excuse me from this.

939
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:42,916
What will we do  
 for the money then?

940
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:44,500
What will we tell Sherley?

941
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:47,958
We'll have to find some other way.

942
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,083
I don't know...

943
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:51,583
But this...

944
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:53,708
I'm afraid to do this, Chaacha.

945
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,750
It's not fear, but...

946
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:59,791
it's like being part of a crime.  
 I can't do it, Chaacha.

947
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,250
Chaachan doesn't want food.

948
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:19,833
He is angry.

949
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:21,666
Let me try giving him some milk.

950
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,458
I don't want milk.

951
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,500
You should have something  
 in your stomach.

952
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:41,875
You're taking these tablets, right?  
 - This is just indigestion.

953
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:44,125
It will be cured only if I  
 sleep on an empty stomach.

954
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:48,916
It's just milk.  
 What's wrong if you drink it, Chaacha?

955
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,875
Didn't I say that I don't want it?  
 Take it back.

956
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:57,958
Not happening!

957
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:09,958
[praying]

958
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:46,208
[loud thud]

959
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,166
Royichaya!

960
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:50,250
Royichaya!

961
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,125
Royichaya, come fast.

962
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:55,208
Yeah, coming!

963
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,541
Royichaya!

964
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,250
Royichaya!

965
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,083
Don't try to get up, Chaacha.

966
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,375
Just a second.

967
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,541
Chaacha, just move your leg here.

968
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:08,666
Help him up.

969
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:11,083
Move. I'll hold him.

970
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,875
Hold his hand.  
 Careful!

971
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,625
- Are you able to walk, Chaacha?  
 - Yeah, it's okay.

972
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,250
Oh no! There's a cut.

973
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:34,041
It's a bad cut.

974
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Okay.

975
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:41,041
I'll give it.

976
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:44,375
Okay.

977
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:46,041
Okay.  
 Thank you, Doctor.

978
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,250
Thank you.

979
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,125
Doctor said that we'll have to take  
 an X-Ray if the swelling increases.

980
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,750
Doctor asked me to  
 give you Brufen,

981
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:57,000
once you eat something.

982
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:00,250
Just grind some drumstick  
 leaves with salt and apply it.

983
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,666
It's Annamma's quick-heal method.

984
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:04,875
If I had a fracture,  
 the pain wouldn't be like this.

985
01:16:13,291 --> 01:16:15,791
I'll make some tea and come.

986
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:19,291
Once he takes this,  
 he can have the medicine.

987
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:12,125
Has the pain increased?

988
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:25,791
You're worried that you  
 told me a secret, right?

989
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:28,833
Why are you getting scared?

990
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,875
I won't cause any  
 trouble for you.

991
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:41,166
The amount of love  
 you have for Sherley?

992
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:43,125
I have the same towards her.

993
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:46,083
Her happiness is what my life is.

994
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:49,750
If it's built upon a lie,  
 let it be.

995
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,291
I won't cause any  
 change in that.

996
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:59,625
Just think that you  
 shared a burden of yours.

997
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:03,791
I'll find another  
 way to get the money.

998
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:05,041
I'll find another way.

999
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,041
Enough.

1000
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:24,625
- Should I switch on the fan?  
 - No.

1001
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:48,666
Roy...

1002
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:50,500
The audit is on the Sixth.

1003
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:52,541
If I don't get the money,  
 I'll be in a soup.

1004
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:55,875
There's a small problem in  
 selling the property here.

1005
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:57,666
I'm trying other options.

1006
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,166
The money will reach you by 5th.

1007
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:03,125
For your kind information,  
 5th of April happens to be a Sunday.

1008
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:06,166
If I don't get it on 4th,  
 then there's no point getting it.

1009
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:09,208
That date is too close.

1010
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:12,000
Is there any chance that you can  
 roll the money once again, Vyshak?

1011
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:14,083
You can roll my dead  
 body, you ******.

1012
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:17,666
If this news comes out,

1013
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,083
I can't stay alive.

1014
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:21,000
No one will give me any work.

1015
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,041
Hey!

1016
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,083
I'll die.

1017
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:25,916
Once I am dead,

1018
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,833
everything will  
 fall upon Ankita.

1019
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:30,125
I'll die only after killing her.

1020
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:53,333
It was Vyshak.

1021
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:08,541
Hello?

1022
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,625
Is it Binu?

1023
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,208
Yes.

1024
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:13,833
I am Ittyavira sir's daughter.

1025
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,166
Sherley.

1026
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:16,875
Yes.

1027
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:19,208
I wanted to ask you something.

1028
01:20:20,291 --> 01:20:21,791
It's a small emergency.

1029
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:26,083
We're urgently in need  
 of some money here.

1030
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:30,583
What I'm asking is that,  
 if we sign an agreement,

1031
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:33,375
will you have cash in hand  
 to give us an advance?

1032
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:36,708
Yes.

1033
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:40,041
Okay.

1034
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:51,833
Chaacha.

1035
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:09,958
Has the pain subsided, Chaacha?

1036
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,333
I had a slight fever  
 in the morning.

1037
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,791
Your friend said he will  
 kill himself, is it?

1038
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,666
I told you, right?

1039
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:23,458
This is His plan.

1040
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:29,291
We won't understand it now.

1041
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:39,541
What did he say?

1042
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,083
Okay.

1043
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:43,708
Just a minute.

1044
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:44,708
I'll call you back.

1045
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,083
Roy?

1046
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:50,541
The cash will be  
 ready by afternoon.

1047
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:51,666
You'll pick it up, right?

1048
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,458
Yes, I'll handle it.

1049
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:54,833
Is it true?

1050
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:57,125
Well, where did you get it from?

1051
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:00,750
And listen, last night  
 I was a little too...

1052
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:01,791
Drunk!

1053
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:04,333
I'll call you once  
 I get the cash.

1054
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:05,583
Okay.

1055
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,125
Here.

1056
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:23,833
There's one more page, Chaacha.

1057
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:25,041
Here.

1058
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:35,416
I think that's all.

1059
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:40,041
Okay.

1060
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:31,166
Count it and keep it inside.

1061
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:32,666
Thank you.

1062
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:42,291
That's our school building.

1063
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:45,791
This is Sister Alphonsa.

1064
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:49,208
Do you have guavas there now?

1065
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,833
That guava tree is gone, dear.

1066
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:54,500
Our palm tree fell upon that.

1067
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,333
I'll send a PIN.

1068
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,708
Just send it.

1069
01:23:57,791 --> 01:24:00,125
Anyone will give directions to  
 Ittyavira sir's house here.

1070
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:01,125
Royichaya...

1071
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:02,791
Hi...

1072
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,083
Hi.

1073
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:05,583
I was talking here.

1074
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,250
Yeah. That's an old name.

1075
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:09,375
No one has such names now.

1076
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,041
There are many such  
 old names here.

1077
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,083
Vareeth, Kuriya, Pothan,

1078
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:14,791
It's easy to remember them.

1079
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:18,000
We're trying to get the pass  
 for the date of 7th April.

1080
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:21,083
But now there's no guarantee  
 for anything, right?

1081
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,833
We're moving forward with the belief  
 that the Lord will take care of it.

1082
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,208
Ever since Merin left, she  
 has been with us full time.

1083
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:28,500
She joins us for  
 all the work here.

1084
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,125
And she enjoys it too.

1085
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:33,458
I'll call you, Sister.

1086
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,125
If there's any change.

1087
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:36,791
Okay then.

1088
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:38,791
Bye, dear.

1089
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:40,125
Bye, dear.

1090
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:45,083
- Hey!  
 - Chaachan had fever in the morning.

1091
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:47,000
I just gave him Crocin  
 for the time being.

1092
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:50,166
If we leave on the 7th...

1093
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,916
Oh no! Sheeja would  
 leave on the 6th.

1094
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,708
She won't be able to help  
 Chaachan get up anyway.

1095
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:03,125
Shall we ask Bhasi to come  
 and stay here for a day?

1096
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:07,000
Or if Bhasi is ready to come,

1097
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:10,125
that would be best.  
 You can stay here.

1098
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:15,333
But we've applied for  
 the pass in your name.

1099
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,250
Will that be a problem?

1100
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:20,041
That will be a problem.

1101
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:21,708
Let's see.

1102
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:31,416
If this damn Corona  
 wasn't there,

1103
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:34,416
this could have been solved easily  
 with one massage from Pakshirajan.

1104
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:38,791
His name is not Pakshirajan.

1105
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,833
It's Chandramohan.

1106
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:42,500
If someone calls you 'Spade' Rajan,  
 will you like it?

1107
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:45,625
I don't have any problem now.

1108
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:47,958
See, the swelling has decreased.

1109
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:49,666
Only my back pains.

1110
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,250
I always ask you to  
 be careful, right?

1111
01:25:51,541 --> 01:25:53,125
The land here is all very uneven.

1112
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,583
And you never stay put, sir.

1113
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,208
If I stay idle,

1114
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,583
I'll die of too much bile.

1115
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:00,541
Oh! I've worn it!

1116
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:03,708
So early morning  
 on the 6th, right?

1117
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:05,416
Not 6th.  
 It's on the 7th.

1118
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:06,500
Next Tuesday.

1119
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:08,250
- Will you mess it up?  
 - No.

1120
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:10,416
Shall I leave then, sir?

1121
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:18,250
Bhasi...

1122
01:26:21,791 --> 01:26:23,291
Will you be able to arrange  
 a bottle of alcohol?

1123
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:25,500
It's really difficult.  
 All the liquor shops are closed.

1124
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:26,958
We brew our own alcohol now.

1125
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:28,916
Will you drink the local brew?

1126
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:32,291
Fine then!

1127
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,625
Radhakrishnan sir has sent me.

1128
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,625
- Whose house are you looking for?  
 - This house only.

1129
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:04,416
I came following the map.

1130
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:07,333
Itty...

1131
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:08,708
I was told to ask  
 for Ittyavira.

1132
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:10,708
This is Vyshak's man.  
 Get the bag.

1133
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:14,625
There are many cops and  
 barricades on the roads.

1134
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:16,625
That's why I came  
 early in the morning.

1135
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:19,708
Err... 98460....

1136
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:21,666
...28571.

1137
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:23,416
- 28571?  
 - Yes.

1138
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:25,250
Where are you headed?  
 Ernakulam?

1139
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:26,666
No. Just nearby.

1140
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:35,958
You can take the bag with you.

1141
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:46,166
Bye.

1142
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,958
This is not like what  
 you get in liquor stores.

1143
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:03,916
It's brewed with pure ingredients.

1144
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:05,875
My opinion is that  
 brewing local spirits

1145
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:08,666
should be declared as a cottage  
 industry, and given loans and subsidies.

1146
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:09,708
Here you go.

1147
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,875
You shouldn't add water to this.

1148
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:19,625
Like this...

1149
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,833
You should chase it with  
 some water immediately.

1150
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:23,916
Otherwise...

1151
01:28:26,666 --> 01:28:28,000
all your organs would catch fire!

1152
01:28:29,666 --> 01:28:30,666
Here you go.

1153
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:32,791
- I'll give you another one.  
 - No.

1154
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:33,958
Fine.

1155
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:37,958
I can't drink without  
 mixing some water.

1156
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:58,916
This was brewed from toddy.

1157
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,416
But this is the first brew.

1158
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,500
The brew with cashew apple  
 is of a different league!

1159
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,416
This place is cold and windy.

1160
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:10,375
This must be a regular spot  
 for you, right Bhasi?

1161
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:12,125
We used to drink here, long back.

1162
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,458
- Whom do you mean by 'we'? Chaachan?  
 - No way!

1163
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,291
With him, we can drink  
 over there, right?

1164
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:19,041
We used to drink here,  
 because we were scared of him.

1165
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,125
Then whom did you mean by 'we'?

1166
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:26,166
By 'we'...

1167
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:27,625
I meant myself.

1168
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,333
If it was some woman,  
 you needn't tell me! - No!

1169
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:31,708
That's not the case.

1170
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:34,791
It was back when  
 Augustine was alive.

1171
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,791
You were really close  
 to Augustine, right?

1172
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:40,875
What a question!

1173
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:43,375
He was something else!

1174
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:44,375
A phenomenon!

1175
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:46,333
It was so much fun!

1176
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:48,583
The both of us used to go  
 for long trips and stuff.

1177
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,333
Vagamon, Udumbanchola,  
 Thekkady..

1178
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:51,333
Phew!

1179
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:58,416
He had a heart of gold!

1180
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,083
He was really  
 helpful to everyone.

1181
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:04,625
- But I heard that he was quite wayward?  
 - Hey!

1182
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:06,416
Might be!  
 Who's not?

1183
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:07,875
But...

1184
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:09,875
.. he would do anything  
 for people dear to him.

1185
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:11,666
For my...

1186
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:13,791
... elder sister's surgery...

1187
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:16,583
.. he brought money to me  
 at the hospital veranda.

1188
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:17,916
It wasn't a small amount.

1189
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:19,041
50,000 Rupees.

1190
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:21,291
It was worth much more back then!

1191
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:23,458
My sister passed away.

1192
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,250
But I can never forget that man.

1193
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,291
[phone ringing]

1194
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,416
Have you deposited it in the locker?  
 - Yes, it's done.

1195
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:44,875
First of all,  
 I'm scared of COVID.

1196
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:46,000
And now, this.

1197
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:47,083
I almost lost it.

1198
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,583
That's because the time is such.

1199
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:50,708
Or it wouldn't be so difficult.

1200
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I also got scared.

1201
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,791
It's really difficult  
 to hide it now.

1202
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:56,875
Actually, I'm someone who thought  
 these online transactions are good.

1203
01:30:57,208 --> 01:30:58,458
But now?

1204
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:00,291
Minor misappropriations are going  
 to be really difficult hereafter.

1205
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:02,500
They're monitoring our phones  
 and mails with machines, right?

1206
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:04,458
They can even tell us the colour  
 of the underwear we're wearing.

1207
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,500
Think about it.

1208
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,541
We're going back to slavery.

1209
01:31:07,791 --> 01:31:10,250
In fact, slavery is already happening,  
 with digital chains and all.

1210
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,458
Do you know the  
 Ghulam Ali - Lucky Ali joke?

1211
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:15,500
Listen.  
 Two friends who are named 'Ali'.

1212
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:17,166
One used to work  
 in an IT company.

1213
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:19,083
And the other one  
 had a Paan shop.

1214
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,458
Hey! Just a minute.  
 I'll call you back.

1215
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,958
[phone ringing]

1216
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:15,458
Hello?

1217
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:16,583
Aunty?

1218
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:19,916
Augustine's mother, right?

1219
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Who are you?

1220
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,333
I am Binoy.

1221
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,375
We studied together  
 till 10th grade.

1222
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:28,666
What do you want?

1223
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:30,833
He's at the Kunneppally cemetery.  
 Go and see!

1224
01:32:30,833 --> 01:32:32,125
Didn't you guys get him killed?

1225
01:32:32,541 --> 01:32:33,958
What do you want to know now?

1226
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,458
I was a little late  
 to know about it.

1227
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,458
And I couldn't call then too.

1228
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:42,125
You guys spoiled  
 my darling child.

1229
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:43,458
He was God-fearing.

1230
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,250
So many damn friends!

1231
01:32:45,291 --> 01:32:46,666
And you are all  
 well settled now!

1232
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Don't you live off selling  
 ration rice in the black market?

1233
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:50,500
You're from Ayyankoyikkal, right?

1234
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:53,208
Many of you are in the Middle  
 East, America and Ireland.

1235
01:32:53,625 --> 01:32:54,625
Who lost, ultimately?

1236
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:56,166
Me and his daughter!

1237
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:58,458
His wife got married again!

1238
01:35:23,166 --> 01:35:24,333
Did you recognize me?

1239
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:26,708
I am Pradeep's elder brother,  
 Prasad.

1240
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:28,375
Your name is Saajan, right?

1241
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:29,416
Yes.

1242
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:30,875
Which Pradeep are  
 you talking about?

1243
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:33,708
You, then a short, dark  
 friend of yours, Augustine...

1244
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:34,916
You guys were a gang, right?

1245
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:36,833
You studied with Augustine, right?

1246
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:38,791
Who hasn't studied with  
 Augustine in this town?

1247
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,541
He studied in 7  
 schools in 14 years.

1248
01:35:41,583 --> 01:35:43,416
Where is this Pradeep now?

1249
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:45,041
He's at a rig in Kuwait.

1250
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:48,333
So he needn't be scared of Corona,  
 until someone gets infected there.

1251
01:35:48,541 --> 01:35:51,083
Did he study in St. Mary's or Holy Family?

1252
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,500
In Holy Family.

1253
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,958
That's why I couldn't remember.

1254
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,666
I failed for two years there.

1255
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,000
Many students studied  
 with me then.

1256
01:35:57,041 --> 01:35:59,541
Augustine came to my class  
 when I failed the second time.

1257
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:01,208
Then we shifted to  
 St. Mary's together.

1258
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:04,250
After one year, they sent  
 him off with a TC from there.

1259
01:36:04,708 --> 01:36:05,875
We still remained friends.

1260
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:07,833
But I don't think he  
 passed 10th grade.

1261
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:14,583
How's the business going?

1262
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:15,875
It's really dull.

1263
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:21,250
Augustine is no more.  
 You would have heard, right?

1264
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:22,291
Yes, I heard about it.

1265
01:36:22,541 --> 01:36:23,708
It's been around 10 years.

1266
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:26,333
His wife got married again.  
 She would have had children by now.

1267
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:29,208
His body was found 2 years  
 after he went missing.

1268
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,000
The police had  
 investigated for quite long.

1269
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:34,333
There's a guy who fills petrol  
 at H.P. Fuels in Mankuzhy.

1270
01:36:34,375 --> 01:36:35,375
What was his name?

1271
01:36:35,416 --> 01:36:37,000
Vinod!  
 It was that case.

1272
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:39,000
When did you leave from here?

1273
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:40,875
In 2000.

1274
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:42,166
So you wouldn't know.

1275
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:43,541
All this happened after that.

1276
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,291
It was Augustine who  
 chopped Vinod's hand.

1277
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,291
Careful.

1278
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:02,166
Gently.

1279
01:38:16,166 --> 01:38:17,166
I'll do it.

1280
01:38:24,416 --> 01:38:25,958
- Some more?  
 - No.

1281
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:23,958
Royichaya... just check this.

1282
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:27,875
Nice.

1283
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:28,958
Chaacha?

1284
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:33,125
Okay, right?  
 - Yes.

1285
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:37,416
Royichaya, I've kept  
 the marinade here.

1286
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:40,875
Once you finish cutting it,  
 move the fish and put it on the stove.

1287
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:58,333
Are you worried thinking  
 about that dead guy?

1288
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:01,041
If he was alive now,

1289
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:03,583
I would have died long back,  
 seeing my daughter suffering.

1290
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:08,750
Sherley fell in love with  
 him at some cursed time!

1291
01:40:10,208 --> 01:40:12,500
He wooed her when  
 she knew no better.

1292
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:14,166
He was really smart at all that.

1293
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:17,458
Otherwise,

1294
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:20,208
will she accept him after he leaves  
 her for months and comes back?

1295
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:22,875
The last time he left like that,

1296
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:25,291
Sherley was three months  
 pregnant with Sophie.

1297
01:40:29,541 --> 01:40:31,500
It was a relationship that  
 she fought for, right?

1298
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:33,583
She kept it all within herself.

1299
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:35,958
You know her, right?

1300
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:41,083
If Annamma was alive,  
 this wedding would never have happened.

1301
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:44,833
I thought he would become  
 better after marriage.

1302
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:47,333
He is from a decent family.

1303
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:50,541
His father John Chacko was an  
 engineer at the electricity board.

1304
01:40:51,625 --> 01:40:54,333
And this guy kept failing  
 and changing schools...

1305
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,208
He studied even in my  
 school for one year.

1306
01:40:56,958 --> 01:41:00,500
He slapped Gopalan sir on his face,  
 for catching some mischief of his,

1307
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,708
in front of the entire class.

1308
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:03,833
We sent him off with a TC.

1309
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:05,666
His mother came in with excuses.

1310
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:08,291
She's the one who spoiled him.

1311
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:11,291
When his father tries to beat him,  
 she'll come between them.

1312
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:13,500
If you don't beat kids  
 while raising them....

1313
01:41:15,416 --> 01:41:16,416
this is what happens.

1314
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:20,708
He was a real rowdy.

1315
01:41:21,833 --> 01:41:24,125
I don't know how  
 Sherley liked him.

1316
01:41:25,291 --> 01:41:26,291
But there's one thing.

1317
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:29,625
If you enquire about him in town,  
 you'll hear only good opinions.

1318
01:41:30,416 --> 01:41:32,916
There's no scoundrel in town who  
 hasn't taken money from him.

1319
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:34,958
Why wouldn't he give them?

1320
01:41:35,416 --> 01:41:37,708
He made all that money by  
 doing sacrilegious acts.

1321
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:39,458
He needn't keep accounts for it.

1322
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:41,625
Bloody b*****d!

1323
01:41:50,875 --> 01:41:52,500
Didn't you finish cutting it?

1324
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:54,458
Burnt it?

1325
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:20,166
This one's not like the  
 property we saw earlier.

1326
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:21,708
This one stands on  
 4.5 acres of land.

1327
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:23,375
Tennis court, park for children,

1328
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:24,833
swimming pool, clubhouse...

1329
01:42:25,041 --> 01:42:26,625
And there are paddy fields all around.

1330
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,708
It's really windy and  
 has a superb view too.

1331
01:42:29,916 --> 01:42:31,416
Will there be mosquitoes?

1332
01:42:31,708 --> 01:42:33,000
Will there be mosquitoes?

1333
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:34,750
Mosquitoes won't  
 fly above 30 feet.

1334
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:36,083
It's really windy here, right?

1335
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,250
This door is made from wild teak...

1336
01:42:41,791 --> 01:42:42,791
... from Nilambur.

1337
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:45,083
Shoot a video.

1338
01:42:48,416 --> 01:42:49,500
There's no power yet.

1339
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,958
But it's very bright here.

1340
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:53,166
This is the dining hall.  
 Light comes from three sides.

1341
01:42:56,833 --> 01:42:58,750
There will be a  
 modular kitchen here.

1342
01:42:58,791 --> 01:43:00,583
The gas comes through a pipe.

1343
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:02,083
There will be a fire  
 safety valve there.

1344
01:43:02,083 --> 01:43:03,833
Another one here.  
 There will be two.

1345
01:43:04,791 --> 01:43:06,000
That's the exhaust fan.

1346
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:08,166
This is a sliding door.

1347
01:43:08,208 --> 01:43:09,625
It's really convenient.

1348
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:11,791
How's the water provision here?

1349
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:13,291
The water connection is common.

1350
01:43:13,291 --> 01:43:14,791
There are two over  
 there too, right?

1351
01:43:15,208 --> 01:43:18,125
This is the area with the  
 living room and dining hall.

1352
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:21,333
We will have to buy new  
 curtains for all the windows.

1353
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:22,958
This is what they have there.

1354
01:43:23,083 --> 01:43:24,083
This is the kitchen.

1355
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:25,666
Which side is the bathroom at?

1356
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:28,041
There's one bathroom  
 in the living area.

1357
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:30,416
But we can use it  
 as a guest bathroom.

1358
01:43:30,416 --> 01:43:33,458
There are attached  
 bathrooms in all bedrooms.

1359
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:09,125
How much?

1360
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:13,250
Fill up the tank. There's a can  
 in the boot. Please fill that too.

1361
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:16,250
Sir, that's...

1362
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:18,083
I'm going on a long  
 drive tomorrow.

1363
01:44:18,083 --> 01:44:20,250
It's the lock down, right?  
 If we're stuck on the way...

1364
01:44:20,291 --> 01:44:21,500
What happened to your hand?

1365
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:24,291
It got cut by a  
 sugarcane juice machine.

1366
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,666
I'm not supposed  
 to give it in cans.

1367
01:45:02,166 --> 01:45:03,166
Did you fill fuel?  
 - Yes.

1368
01:45:03,708 --> 01:45:05,500
I'll go take a bath and come.

1369
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:15,250
Keep this.

1370
01:46:38,375 --> 01:46:40,125
What happened actually, Chaacha?

1371
01:46:41,125 --> 01:46:43,750
After admitting Sherley at  
 the hospital for her delivery,

1372
01:46:43,875 --> 01:46:46,125
I came back home  
 to get some food.

1373
01:46:47,125 --> 01:46:51,333
It had been six months since we  
 had any information on Augustine.

1374
01:47:22,458 --> 01:47:24,916
[Child's laughter]

1375
01:47:34,833 --> 01:47:36,416
Not there.  
 Go further down.

1376
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,041
Further down.

1377
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:39,375
Yes. Over there.

1378
01:47:56,541 --> 01:47:57,625
Have you eaten anything?

1379
01:48:33,583 --> 01:48:34,583
You were here, Chaachan?

1380
01:48:36,541 --> 01:48:37,541
Where is Sherley?

1381
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:40,708
Sherley is in the hospital...

1382
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:42,083
... for her delivery.

1383
01:48:45,625 --> 01:48:48,500
But how long has it  
 been since I left?

1384
01:48:48,958 --> 01:48:50,500
Oh yeah! It has  
 been only 7 months.

1385
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:21,250
Hey!

1386
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:24,250
Hey!

1387
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,958
I don't know what  
 Sundaran understood.

1388
01:50:59,375 --> 01:51:01,500
But things turned out to  
 be good for him, as well.

1389
01:51:01,958 --> 01:51:04,125
And only good things  
 have happened thereafter.

1390
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:07,583
I got rid of that  
 thorn from my throat.

1391
01:51:08,083 --> 01:51:10,833
And Sherley was freed from  
 the hell that she chose.

1392
01:51:12,208 --> 01:51:13,208
Then, his daughter...

1393
01:51:15,166 --> 01:51:17,583
Didn't she get a  
 father like you, Roy?

1394
01:51:18,958 --> 01:51:20,250
This is His plan!

1395
01:51:20,791 --> 01:51:22,916
He can see the past and the  
 future at the same time.

1396
01:51:22,916 --> 01:51:24,666
But people like us understand  
 why things happened in the past

1397
01:51:24,708 --> 01:51:26,000
only when we reach the future.

1398
01:51:29,791 --> 01:51:32,000
I wasn't able to bear that sin.

1399
01:51:35,583 --> 01:51:37,166
I kept praying.

1400
01:51:40,041 --> 01:51:42,416
If we pray from our heart,  
 God will listen!

1401
01:51:45,583 --> 01:51:47,666
He showed that to  
 me in the Bible.

1402
01:51:50,833 --> 01:51:53,250
'For I know the plans I have for you,

1403
01:51:53,666 --> 01:51:57,000
plans to prosper you and not to harm you,

1404
01:51:57,375 --> 01:52:00,500
plans to give you  
 hope and a future.'

1405
01:52:05,541 --> 01:52:06,541
Amen!

1406
01:52:06,583 --> 01:52:10,708
I was angry at myself  
 for doubting God's ways.

1407
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,708
You needn't see this as  
 God's will like me, Roy.

1408
01:52:14,958 --> 01:52:17,458
You can understand when you see  
 good things happening, right?

1409
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:20,458
That's what I call God.

1410
01:52:21,125 --> 01:52:22,458
I call it helplessness.

1411
01:54:15,958 --> 01:54:23,208
'These nights, this weather,

1417
01:55:14,625 --> 01:55:15,916
They are here.

1418
01:55:18,583 --> 01:55:20,291
Chaacha! Royicha!  
 - Yes!

1419
01:55:21,041 --> 01:55:22,041
Sophie!

1420
01:55:22,416 --> 01:55:24,166
Don't run, dear.  
 Social distancing!

1421
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Momma!

1422
01:55:26,708 --> 01:55:28,416
You can go to  
 Chaachan after a bath.

1423
01:55:29,875 --> 01:55:30,875
Stop it.

1424
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:33,333
It's been so long  
 since I saw my child.

1425
01:55:33,375 --> 01:55:35,000
Tell me what was happening there.

1426
01:55:37,333 --> 01:55:39,541
Why is there a wound  
 on Royichan's hand?

1427
01:55:39,583 --> 01:55:40,583
Look, Momma.

1428
01:55:41,833 --> 01:55:43,166
What were you both doing?

1429
01:55:43,333 --> 01:55:46,333
We had to cut some firewood  
 behind the kitchen.

1430
01:55:47,375 --> 01:55:49,166
Royichayan?  
 Cutting firewood?

1431
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:51,625
What did you eat?  
 - Guava.

1432
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:53,750
From where?  
 - In the car.

1433
01:55:53,791 --> 01:55:55,666
You sent it for me, right?

1434
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:57,750
Was it good?  
 - I had three of them.

1435
01:56:01,541 --> 01:56:03,250
Mummy, some more butter, please.

1436
01:56:04,333 --> 01:56:05,333
This is enough.

1437
01:56:06,375 --> 01:56:07,708
It's not healthy to have more.

1438
01:56:09,625 --> 01:56:11,333
Where is Sister Alphonsa's house?

1439
01:56:11,375 --> 01:56:12,375
I'll tell you.

1440
01:56:12,583 --> 01:56:15,000
Sister Alphonsa doesn't  
 like Sister Gloria.

1441
01:56:15,041 --> 01:56:16,833
If she sees with me Sister Gloria,

1442
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:19,250
she chases her away, saying that  
 there's some work or the other.

1443
01:56:19,291 --> 01:56:21,750
Then I'll be with Sister  
 Alphonsa for a long time.

1444
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,750
That's not because they  
 don't like each other.

1445
01:56:23,791 --> 01:56:25,916
That's because they both like you, right?  
 - No.

1446
01:56:25,916 --> 01:56:27,291
Both of them are from Pala.

1447
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:28,500
It's a family feud.

1448
01:56:28,541 --> 01:56:30,625
And you know what else Sister  
 Alphonsa doesn't like?

1449
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:34,000
[Banging plates]

1450
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:35,750
Stop it.

1451
01:56:35,916 --> 01:56:37,333
Don't tickle me!

1452
01:56:37,416 --> 01:56:38,875
Have you become  
 more mischievous?

1453
01:56:43,333 --> 01:56:45,333
I don't think I know  
 what Augustine was.

1454
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:48,375
He was a different person  
 to different people.

1455
01:56:49,666 --> 01:56:52,041
I also might be a different  
 person for different people.

1456
01:56:53,333 --> 01:56:55,541
Chaachan knew an Augustine,

1457
01:56:56,166 --> 01:56:58,708
whom Sundaran or  
 Sherley never knew.

1458
01:56:59,208 --> 01:57:00,958
I wonder if Chaachan's  
 burden has reduced.

1459
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,708
As for me, I have a cross  
 to carry to my grave.

1460
01:57:04,791 --> 01:57:06,416
The cross of a knowledge.

1461
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:08,750
- This one?  
 - Yes.

1462
01:57:12,625 --> 01:57:15,083
Sherley keeps saying that  
 God is love.

1463
01:57:16,708 --> 01:57:17,708
That maybe true.

1464
01:57:19,166 --> 01:57:20,166
Who knows!

[News on TV]

1466
01:57:30,791 --> 01:57:34,083
Chaachan was saying that the  
 maintenance fee is quite high here.

1467
01:57:34,416 --> 01:57:36,000
When I checked, it  
 was for six months.

1468
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:39,375
This is nothing compared to what  
 we pay in Bombay, right Royichaya?

1469
01:57:39,416 --> 01:57:40,833
That's because of our area too.

1470
01:57:40,833 --> 01:57:42,458
Everything is quite expensive there.

1471
01:57:42,791 --> 01:57:45,500
It was you who bought  
 a house in that area,

1472
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,958
because you wanted a  
 respectable address, right?

1473
01:57:48,208 --> 01:57:49,500
Now you're blaming the area?

1474
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:50,541
I mean...

1475
01:57:50,541 --> 01:57:52,208
I'll go feed this to the dogs...

1476
01:57:52,416 --> 01:57:53,541
.. and lock the gate.

1477
01:57:53,583 --> 01:57:54,583
Oh no! Chaacha!

1478
01:57:54,875 --> 01:57:57,833
We used to feed the  
 dogs back at home.

1479
01:57:57,958 --> 01:57:59,416
We're in our  
 apartment now, right?

1480
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:02,791
I forgot that.

1481
01:58:16,833 --> 01:58:19,250
Chaacha, I'll wash it.

1482
01:58:20,083 --> 01:58:22,583
Do you know where we bought  
 this sweater from? - No.

1483
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:25,833
We bought this from a  
 huge mall in Bombay.

1484
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:28,541
This is available only over there.

1485
01:58:28,541 --> 01:58:30,291
Are you still feeling cold?

1486
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:32,541
I'm not feeling cold now.

1487
01:58:33,208 --> 01:58:34,208
Sit down.

1488
01:58:56,083 --> 01:58:58,166
We have to take  
 Chaachan to a doctor.

1489
01:59:00,583 --> 01:59:02,291
His forgetfulness is  
 increasing, right?

1490
01:59:21,833 --> 01:59:24,166
He asked me in the morning  
 if Augustine has come.

1491
01:59:44,958 --> 01:59:46,250
Sometimes I feel that...

1492
01:59:48,333 --> 01:59:50,791
... I might run into  
 Augustine somewhere.

1493
01:59:52,958 --> 01:59:53,958
Augustine?

1494
01:59:54,291 --> 01:59:55,291
Yes.

1495
01:59:57,875 --> 02:00:00,541
It's true that it was me  
 who identified the body.

1496
02:00:03,375 --> 02:00:05,666
It was in a badly decomposed state.

1497
02:00:06,625 --> 02:00:08,041
It was found from the highway.

1498
02:00:09,708 --> 02:00:13,250
It was Augustine's Mommy who  
 started crying at the mortuary.

1499
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:17,916
My situation was terrible then!

1500
02:00:20,041 --> 02:00:22,000
A girl who was dumped  
 by her husband...

1501
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:24,875
... with a two-year old child,

1502
02:00:27,041 --> 02:00:29,250
living with help from her father.

1503
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:36,833
You know what I couldn't bear at all?

1504
02:00:38,083 --> 02:00:40,333
The sympathy that came from all around!

1505
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:46,500
Even Sophie would get it, by the  
 time she starts understanding things.

1506
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:55,041
If I had to escape  
 from that suffocation,

1507
02:00:58,291 --> 02:01:01,833
I had to find a closure to  
 the story of Augustine and me.

1508
02:01:07,458 --> 02:01:09,750
If you ask me if it  
 really was Augustine,

1509
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,250
I'm not sure, even today.

1510
02:01:18,833 --> 02:01:20,041
In a way,

1511
02:01:21,958 --> 02:01:24,041
I must have found an end  
 to that story like that.
