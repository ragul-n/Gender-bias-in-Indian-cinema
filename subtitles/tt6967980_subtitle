I drank that water.

50

He's not a crow.
He's a peacock.

Must have not taken a hath today.

66

I asked for a lifl and he obliged.

Sit on a motorcycle,
with both your legs on one side.

76
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:19,514
‘Billi Mishra...
never listens to advice.‘

77
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,124
‘Doesn't have loo many good habits.‘

I want to break you.

We regret the inconvenience caused.

92
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,458
But there's electricity
at our neighbor's home.

93
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,230
Uncle, they have an inverter,
you should also buy one.

94
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,063

"Your waist twists like this..."

121
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,420
Aarush, have a sweet.

00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,024
No aunly, I don't eat sweets.

123
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,834
Why don't both of you
speak in private, son?

124
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,868
Okay Aunly.

125
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,369
Gomspeak to him.

126
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,662
Go.

127
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:30,974
Our daughter Bitti works at the
Electricity board's Complaint Department.

128
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,074
The Complaint Department gets
hundreds of complaints every day.

129
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,786
But, not a single complaint
against our daughter Bitti.

130
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,857
ll occasionally happens in parties...

131
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,052
...olherwise, I don't drink.

132
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,324
I just wanted to ask you one question.

133
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:50,867
Ask.

134
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,402
Are you a...

135
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,533
Are you... a virgin?

136
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,107
Virgin"?

137
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,306
Are you?

138
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,178
It doesn't matter...

139
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,212
But, it does matter
whether you are or not!

140
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,791
No, I'm not! Now?

141
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,925
So many boys have mel her,
but they all rejected her.

142
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,761
There must he something
wrong with our girl.

143
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,626
If I lry talking to her,
she gels angry.

144
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,465
And you don't know how to.
- What do I do?

145
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,733
This is entirely your fault.

146
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,772
She behaves like a guy.

147
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,341
We should've had a boy instead.

148
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,806
Now where are you going?

149
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,246
‘But there's one thing...‘

150
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:41,183
'...lhal always holher's
Billi's mother.‘

151
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,551
‘Billi can't find a suitor.‘

152
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,922
‘Her engagement was canceled twice.‘

153
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,161
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

154
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:11,875
Dear...don'l lake your
mother loo seriously.

155
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,714
She loves you lol.

156
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,186
You know she has thyroid.

157
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,225
Constant mood swings,
and can't stop bickering.

158
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,454
Papa, can I ask you something?

159
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,035
Everything would've been
much easier if I was a boy.

160
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,433
No questions asked.

161
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,368
"He smokes cigarettes.
But, he's a boy."

162
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,908
"Wanders out all night."

163
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,051
"But boys normally do, don't they?"

164
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,024
"He's a loudmoulh,
but has a heart of gold."

165
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,524
"So what if his engagement
got canceled twice."

166
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,199
"He didn't like the girl."

167
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,700
"He just can't marry anyone."

168
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,209
Being a girl is a complete disaster.

169
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,616
Dear, that's how the society is.

170
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,586
I don't believe in their norms, but...

171
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,421
...we still have
to live in this society.

172
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,550
Slop...Sl°P---

173
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,985

Ticket.

175
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,670

Gel your picture clicked, brother.

So how can you publish il in my name?
- Why not?

291

You can, hul you shouldn't...

Look Vidrohi, you're my friend.

Never cross paths of a rejected lover.

299
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,508
Or else, you'll never
find lrue love, gel it?

300
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,719

00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,545
"Everyone only sees
the fault side of me."

467
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,225
"But, in the same faults

"l am really happy to know this."

469

Oh, benevolent Lord.

Great.

536
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:55,050
See you, uncle.

537
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:25,073
"Slay with me...

538
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:30,878
"...and I'll slay with
you like your dreams."

539
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:36,921
"Dwell in my soul...like love..."

00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:12,553
"Hold my hands...

542
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:18,400
"Now you're my desire, my intent."

543
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:23,900
"Say my name, beloved...
I am your world."

544
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:29,908
"The rains follow
you wherever you go."

545
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,409
"The rains follow..."

546
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:38,416
"Stay in my breath...
like the sweet fragrance."

547
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:44,256
"And...l'll pray for your grace."

548
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:50,265

wonder what lies in my fate."

553

She's exactly like
sisler-in-law Bahli.

554
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:35,038
95%
- wonder what lies in my fate."

555
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,712
"Stay with me..."
- Except for the mole on her hack.

556
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,719
"...like the hum on my lips..."

557
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,768
I like you.

558
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,438
What did I do?

559
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:16,878
Actually, I've always come across
stubborn and chauvinistic type of boys.

560
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,078
God knows what they
think of themselves...

561
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,013
...and lreal other women like dirt.

562
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,227
And me?

563
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:28,796
You...

564
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:36,265
You're like a...Lihran.

565
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,264
Lihran.

566
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,765
What a lucky guess.
- You are.

567
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,101
I am a Lihran.

568
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,975
See.
- A pure Libra.

569
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:50,117
Lihrans always maintain a balance.

570
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,083
Like my father.

571
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:58,318
Always maintaining a
balance between me and my mother.

572
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,432
Then your birthday must he nearing!

573
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,363
It's closing in 23 minutes...

574
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,103
Today is your birthday!

575
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,310

Come on...
- That's expensive stuff.

579
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,879
Here...here...

580
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,692
Lovel Sweets...
- Lovely sweets.

581
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,692
The 'y' fell off in the last monsoon.

582
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,320
Come on, we don't have much lime.

583
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,324
How will you open the lock?
You don't have the key.

584
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,800
This is only to keep lhe thieves away.

585
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:43,236
Are you crazy?
- Yeah...don'l you know.

586
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,686
What are you doing?

587
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,232
Happy Birthday Mr. Chirag.

588
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:27,247
How is it?

589
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,416
spicy.

590
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:40,924
"Slay with me...like the hum on my lips..."
- Now?

591
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:46,764
"...and I'll slay with
you like your dreams."

592
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:52,636
"Dwell in my soul...like love..."
- Bye.

593
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:58,745
run in the
direction...the trumpets hlare."

594
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,217
Son...

595
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:17,290
He looks okaymgol a long nose.

596
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,892
No moles on his face either.

597
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,236
Bul even moles can he cut
off with horse's hair.

598
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,901
He owns a printing press,
so must he earning well loo.

599
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,668
Also, he has a motorcycle.

600
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,681
Let's assume that even if his
press shuts down, then...

601
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,411
We still have the confectionery shop.

602
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,144
The least he can do
is shoo away lhe flies.

603
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,988
Isn't it?

604
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,388
I know what Vidrohi
writes in his letters.

605
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,130
I see...
So lell me, James Bond.

606
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:58,437
That you say such cute things.
You have a nice handwriting.

607
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,032
And whenever he opens his letter...

608
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,111
...he can smell your faint fragrance.

609
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,707
That's nothing new.
The entire neighborhood can.

610
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,906
Guess what do I write in the letter?

611
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,887
You're dying to meet him, right?

612
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:18,852
What happened?

613
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:21,596
Tell me...

614
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,599

615
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,860
...lhal I want to meet him.

616
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,328
Bul he ignores my requests.

617
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,966
Maybe he doesn't want to meet you.

618
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,508
Fine, then...

619
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:38,707
...l'll slop writing to him.
- Maybe he does.

620
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,749
I don't know.

621
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,949
I want to meet him only once.

622
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:47,313
I have a right to meet the
man who knows so much about me.

623
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,715
Isn't it?

624
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,763
Only you know him...

625
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:59,564
What if you don't like him?
- Doesn't matter.

626
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:01,937
And, what if you do?

627
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:07,338
If I do, then even my
mom and dad should like him.

628
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,473
If they do, Hi ...olherwise, bye.

Just once.

But, how will you make them meet?

634
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,363
Vidrohi ran away years ago.

635
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,432
Who knows whether
he's still alive or dead?

636
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,661
Who's introducing her to Vidrohi?

637
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:38,366
Then?

638
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,743

00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,207
And who wrote the letter?

So who will go to meet her?

YOu!

00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,581

It's your turn today.

00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,999
See, Bareilly Ki Barfi.

647
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,003
This hook is messing her mind.

648
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:12,902
ll says here if she smokes,
she's good.

649
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:16,173
If she watches English films, she's sweel.
- So what's wrong?

650
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,373
Do you want to know what's wrong?
See...

651
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,914
There's that boy, Chirag.

652
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,917
He's so well-mannered, talented.

653
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,283
And look at himmwrelch.

654
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,747
Don't call him wrelch.

655
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,286
Why not?

656
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,450
I would poison his juice.

657
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,590
Son, you?

658
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,923
I was passing by and
heading towards Ghanla Ghar...

659
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,761
...and thought I should
slop and pay you a visit.

I'll gel some juice for you.
- No, no, aunly.

661
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,000

00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,936
I'll leave.
Your Bareilly Ki Barfi.

Thank you.
- Bless you.

665
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,107
On one side is the girl...

666
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,982
...who's head-over-heels
in love with the author.

667
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:02,784
And on the other side is her mother,
who's willing to take his life.

668
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,956
So what are you planning to do now?

669
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,390
This is love, Munna...

670
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,066
...il demands sacrifice.

671
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,764
Then chalk-out another
name in lhe name of love.

672
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,803
Don't you have any brains?

673

Why?
- Whose name is on the hook?

674
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,175
Pritam Vidrohi.
- And the photo on the hook?

675
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,783
Prilam Vidrohi.

676
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:31,512
So who will make the sacrifice?

677
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:34,284
Prilam Vidrohi.

678
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,561
Brother, your first love
made him flee from the city.

679
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:43,323
What if your second
love demands his life?

680
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,492
No-no...one should not
lreal someone so badly.

681
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,144
Forget it, let's do it.

682

...and noticed
Vidrohi's innocenl face.

Always bullying people around.

You know what,
just take me the way I am.

808
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:10,513
No one likes me anyway,
except for my mother.

809
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,019
She won't either.

810
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:13,578
Let's do that.

811
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,415
We can't lake a chance now.

812
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,221
"With style more than
he himself could handle."

813

"Which one is Guddi?"

995
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:43,992
Who does he think he is,

He wasn't that had though...

997

Tell me...

999
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,673

Every antibiotic needs
to he taken for three days.

My mother always says never
go to any house without a gift.

1020
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:55,868
You're not going there as a suitor.

1021
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,028
Fine, then you can give her this.

1022

"See sister-in-law...it's got

He's not coming over

1029
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:18,383
Dear daughter! I am not so lucky, that a

01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,280

They are very famous, taste it.
- I know.

1101
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:20,602
‘In a brief moment...‘

1102
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:26,244
'...he turned papa's neck straight,
and turned the game around.‘

1103
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:31,146
I told you...send him hack.

1104
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,684
But you wanted to complete the course.

1105
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:35,021
Now it's an overdose.

1106
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:36,857
That was loo much man!

1107
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,859
Were you trying to he a hero?

1108
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,427
I did exactly like you taught me.

1109
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,067
And, what were you
saying on lhe phone?

1110
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,103
You'll make a dimple on my a**
- No, I...

1111
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:53,868
I was only sticking to my character.

1112
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:58,136
My performance will go weak
if you keep changing the script.

1113
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,608
Why did you have to
fix her father's neck?

1114
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:04,447
An old man was in pain...

1115
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,120
...so I thought I should fix his neck.

1116
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:10,085
He is your falher-in-law after all.

1117
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,224
I was just helping you out.
- Mr. Helping hand...

1118
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,522
You were supposed to depress her,
hul you've impressed her instead.

1119
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:19,225
Fine, I'll go hack then.

1120
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,233
Right, go on...
- You cannot leave like this.

1121
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:24,134
You must first clean
up the mess you have made.

1122
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:36,484
This new hairstyle really suits you.

1123
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:37,843
Have another one.
- No...

1124
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,351
Take it.
- I don't want it.

1125
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,516
I've been eating since morning.

1126
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:44,689
You must eat properly.

1127
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,860
You've become so scrawny.

1128
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,259
Will a wedding dress
look nice on this body?

1129
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,407
All the faults are with me, right mom?

1130
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,406
You can wear my wedding dress.

1131
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,815

- Yes d ear.

1132
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:18,187

1139
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,874
You should eat more sweets...

1141
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,348
Am I that hitter?
- No...

01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,277
...hul, you're not like

1143
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:47,720
I mean, Rama and me.

1144
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:52,858
What did you and Rama think?

1145
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:57,397
You see...your letters were filled
with the fragrance of romance.

1146
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,861
Bul you turned out to
he the fragrance of bullies

1147
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,368

You're not that had person.

It's the conditions
That make people had.

1151
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,641
You are right.

1152
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,651
It's the conditions and
people who made me hitter.

1153
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,816
Bul even hitter people have a...

1154
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:26,858
Huh?

1155
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:31,128
Heartmand it's not hitter at all.

1156
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,494

1157
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:39,237

You never asked.

1162

From the time he is here
you don't even miss me.

1163
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,960
You could've at least called.

That You're my very good friend.

1181
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:49,639
No one does what you did for me.

1182
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:54,074
She just friend-zoned me.
- They are here.

1183
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:57,574
You're here.

1184
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,675
Brother...

1185
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,447
Vidrohi, Remember we
must close this chapter today.

1186
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:03,922
I've hy-hearted everything,
brother, don't worry.

1187
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,061
How are you?
- Great.

1188
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,184
Hello.

1189
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:12,790
We're early.
- You're half an hour late.

1190
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,626
This place is for hoozing at night.

1191
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:17,103
And you guys are eating groundnuls.

1192
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,662
Yeah, right.
Looking at the way you drink...

1193
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,536
...you would hardly have any
place in your stomach for groundnuls.

1194
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,733
You're absolutely right.

1195
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:26,270
This is exactly what I say
to myself every night when I drink.

1196
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:28,746
And forget in the morning.

1197
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,308
He's also got memory loss.
- Yeah...

1198
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:35,986
Oh yes...

1199
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:38,820
And I've also been to jail
once because of this mix-up.

1200
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:39,824
I see...

1201
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:43,396
Oh, God...jail...criminal...
this is really serious.

1202
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,863
It's nothing serious.

1203
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:47,132
Lord Krishna was also horn in a jail.

1204
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:49,997
And, one should not
remember everything.

1205
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,664
Wow. . .

1206
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,372
What if I forget you tomorrow?

1207
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,173
It's not that easy
to forget Bitti Mishra.

1208
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:00,675
Let's make a hel.

1209
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:02,773
And you'll definitely not forget
me unlil tomorrow.

1210
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:04,284
What is there tomorrow?
- What?

1211
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:06,376
How can you forget?
You printed all those pamphlets.

1212
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:09,318

of Lovely Sweets.

1213
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:13,317
How can you not come?
- He can't come.

1214
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,487
Why not?

01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:19,131
Happy journey.

01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:23,805
Going hack... Yeah, I'm going hack.

1218
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,534
How can he come?
He's leaving, he can't come.

1219
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,666
Hold this. Show me the ticket.

1220
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:33,373

1221
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:35,242

01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,245
No, Billi...

1224
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,755
I swear I'll never talk to you again.
Return the ticket.

1225
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:44,789
Tell her.
- Yeah, I won't either.

1226
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:46,816
No chance.
- Fine, leave.

1227
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:48,828
Give me your phone.

1228
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:50,295
I'm low on balance.

1229
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:53,661
Delele my number, and I will loo.

1230
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:55,161
Because you're leaving.

1231
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:56,670
Go on...
- Great.

1232
01:09:56,826 --> 01:10:00,035
So Mr. Vidrohi,

1233
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:01,866
Lets go
- Brother, keys.

Don't he sad, Bitti.

01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:06,943
Please, leave.

1236
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:09,108
This is no time to gel emotional,
Vidrohi.

1237
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,813
I had a hard time getting
this ticketmthrough VVIP quota.

1238
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,219
With recommendations from Mr. Vishnoi.

1239
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:17,757
Let's go.
- Billi...

1240
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,558
No...lhe trains are packed.

1241
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,195
'Vidrohi's revolt... Fantastic.‘

1242
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,336
I can't go hack breaking your heart.

1243
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:33,339
‘But soon he was hit...
I mean got ditched.‘

1244
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,274
You cannot leave Billi.
- Listen to me.

1245
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,707
You tore up the ticket.

1246
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,712
I like Rama, Brother. If I die,
Billi won't wail for 14 years.

1247
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:43,873
Just kill him.

1248
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,953
I like Rama.

1249
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,659
I like Rama.

1250
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,462
Billi's my sisler-in-law.

1251
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,297
The question is whether
Rama likes you loo.

1252
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:01,668
Don't know.

1253
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:04,601
But I tore up the ticket to find out.

1254
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,505
I'll slay here for another
week and lest her.

1255
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:10,878
If she's the one for me,
then we'll leave together.

1256
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:13,971
Sorry.
- Hl.lh!

1257
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,478

your attention on Rama.

Okay.
I will support you in this love story.

1263
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,968
Buy a really nice gift for Rama.

1264
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,230
There's no need for this.
- It's love after all.

1265
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,828
I've told you a thousand limes...

1266
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:39,896

1269
01:11:57,213 --> 01:12:00,592
"Always dressed smartly,
whether it's Delhi or Agra."

1270
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:04,187
"Your earrings make
my hearl skip a heal."

1271
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,166
"When you shake the waist,
it steals millions of hearts."

1272
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:19,004
"Your earrings make

1273
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:22,675
"When you shake the waist,

1274
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:24,581
"Slop taunting me...

Don't he a wise guy."

1276
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,182
"lam not Juliet,

01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:30,689
And you're not my Romeo."

1278
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:35,220
"O Sweely..."

1279
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:39,261
"O Sweely your drama,
creates a slir."

1280
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,962
"This is unfair."

1281
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:46,699
"Believe il or not,
we're crazy about you..."

1282
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:50,233
"Listen O,
sweetheart, we're your beloved."

1283
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,108
..DJ_..

1284
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,447
"Crazy"

1285
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:06,956
"Don't make a commotion..."

1286
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:08,825
"...everyone's watching."

1287
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:12,526
"What do you gel from making a scene."

1288
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:16,195
"Don't ignore me...
I am not useless."

1289
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:19,603

"Slop taunting me...

01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,707

"lam not your Juliet,

1293
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,911
And you're not my Romeo."

1294
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:32,476
"O Sweely..."

1295
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:36,586
"O Sweely your drama, creates a slir."

1296
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:40,252

"Always dressed smartly,

1301
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:10,981
Bravo, Mr. Mishra.

1302
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:14,488
The ‘Pukhraj-gem‘ has
started to show effect.

1303
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,624
We were trying to
find one suitor for Billi...

1304
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:19,497
...hul, now we found lwo.

1305
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,166
Now, choose what you want.

1306
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,437
And, it's not like we've
to choose between good or had.

1307
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,676
One's goodmand the
olher's a slightly heller.

1308
01:14:32,368 --> 01:14:33,972
Both are well suited.

1309
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:37,849
That's lhe problem.
Who do we choose?

1310
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,513
Right?

1311
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:48,789
‘On one side, Mr. Vidrohi was
making his impression‘

1312
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:52,693
...while on lhe other Mr.
Chirag was breaking his head

1313
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:57,001
Hello, aunly.
- Hello-hello.

1314
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,504
Your spectacles were broken,
weren't they? I got it fixed.

1315
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:05,837
That's a big help, son.

1316
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:09,213
It's hard to read anything without it.

1317
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:12,211
Everything3 so clear now.

1318
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:18,582
Son, you care so much for everyone.

1319
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:22,763
Can I say something?
- Please do.

1320
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,960
I've been thinking about
something for the past few days.

1321
01:15:27,457 --> 01:15:29,528
About Billi's marriage.

1322
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,966
Oh, Aunly,
Billi is a really nice girl.

1323
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,008
She will gel married sooner or later,
don't worry.

1324
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,368
Yeah...

1325
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:38,712
Actually, I already know
who's best groom for her.

1326
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:42,212
I will convince Billi...

1327
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,478
And you...
- What?

1328
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:46,920
You convince Vidhrohi.

1329
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:56,195
Vidrohi...for Billi?
- Yes.

1330
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,028
Did Bitti say that?
- She doesn't have to.

1331
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,565
They look like a match made in heaven.

1332
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:04,771
You just he like God Hanuman

1333
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:07,433
...and lake this burden off my chest.

1334
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:10,373
‘When a lover feels
the storm in the sea.

1335
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,945
'...he finds different ways to
to save himself from loosing his love.

1336
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,447
Whal happened?
- Whal can I say, aunly?

1337
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,449
Vidrohi is a divorcee.
- Hllh?

1338
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:21,353
Hmm...

1339
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,428
Brother Chirag.
- This way, Vidrohi.

1340
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:29,952
Brother...

1341
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,795
What's wrong?
Why did you call me suddenly?

1342
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,157
What's happening, isn't good for you.

1343
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:37,733
What happened now?

1344
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:41,898
That seed of love,
you sowed in Rama's heart...

1345
01:16:42,165 --> 01:16:43,610
...was reaped by someone else.

1346
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,440
Whal do you mean?
- ll means...

1347
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,411
Someone came to see Rama yesterday.

1348
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,381
And they really liked Rama a lol.

1349
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:50,573
Liked her?

1350
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,778
Total.

1351
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:54,644
Did Rama say yes?

1352
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:56,618
She didn't say no either.

1353
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:01,458
Who...who is the guy?
Tell me his name.

1354
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,427
There's nothing you can do.

1355
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,724
He's a goldsmilh,
he's got a shop of his own.

1356
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:09,095
He can melt silver,
and make jewelry for Rama.

1357
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:12,468
Even his security guard makes
more money than you.

1358
01:17:15,698 --> 01:17:17,006
But...

1359
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,405
I've seen love in
Rama's eyes for you.

1360
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:25,241
Yeah...so did I.
In fact, I've seen il more often.

1361
01:17:25,575 --> 01:17:26,952
Honestly?

1362
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:31,016
So, what should I do, brother?

1363
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:33,893
My advice is that you
should tell her tomorrow.

1364
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:36,490
Tomorrow is also lucky Wednesday.
- Yes.

1365
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,992
I will if you say so.
- And, listen...

1366
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:44,361
Say il in front of everyone.
- Why?

1367
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,864
Huh! You only kiss in private.

1368
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:51,576
...hul in front of everyone
you openly express your love.

1369
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:54,442
You're right, brother. I will lry.

1370
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:56,380
And, write down a few lines,
so you can propose to her.

1371
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:58,315
Have you heard
Allaf Raja's(Singer) songs?

1372
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:00,819
You'll gel lols of ideas from him.
- Okay.

1373
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,250
Okay, brother.

1374
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,861
What do you think, brother?
Will Rama say a yes?

1375
01:18:09,952 --> 01:18:11,295
Wh o cares?

1376
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:15,158
The neighbor's kid
has climbed up lhe tree.

1377
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,266
If he hikes down safely,
we'll gel to eat mangoes.

1378
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,795
And, if he falls down and dies,
we'll gel to eat at his funeral.

1379
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,769
In this situation,
whether Rama says yes or no...

1380
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:25,277
Billi is sure to gel heartbroken.

1381
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:28,110
Can I say something, brother?

1382
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:29,577
You're such a villain.

1383
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:39,621
This lake is where love was horn!

1384
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,161
The film was called ‘Jawani Diwaani‘.

1385
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:45,629
Vinod Khanna and Dharmendra
waged a fierce war.

1386
01:18:45,688 --> 01:18:47,599
And the reason was
Hema Malini, mister.

1387
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,636
Say it.
- "Dream Girl..."

1388
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:53,230
"The queen of my dreams...
Dream girl."

1389
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:56,944
Turn your head that sidemand
enjoy the view from this side.

1390
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,909
Mister.
- Yes, mister.

1391
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:01,010
Can you stay quiet, mister?
- Why, mister?

1392
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,014
Would you like one, mister?

1393
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,414
Why are you gelling angry?

1394
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:05,042
ll was so much fun.

1395
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:08,688
Turn your head that side...
and enjoy the view from this side.

1396
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:12,085
Mr. Vidrohi wants to say something.
- Really...

1397
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:13,349
speak LIP--

1398
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,260
Don't he shy.

1399
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,297
Oh no...l am not shy.

1400
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:24,763
"Your heart has stolen my heart."

1401
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:27,103
"And stolen my peace and sleep."

1402
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:29,006
"Don't make any excuses."

1403
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,543
"l've made up my mind
to make you my wife, Rama."

1404
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:31,577
"Will you marriage me?"

1405
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,278
"Will you marry me?"
- "Will you marriage me?"

1406
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:52,155
Look...Vidrohi, you're a great guy.

1407
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:56,734
And I like you loo.
- Thank you.

1408
01:19:57,426 --> 01:20:01,067
But, I cannot marry a divorcee.

1409
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:05,444
It's against our culture.
- You've great values.

1410
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:08,148
Divorcee...

1411
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:16,648
Hold on...who's a divorcee?
- Me...

1412
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:17,917
Me?

1413
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,118
What are you saying?

1414
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,119
I've never even been engaged.

1415
01:20:21,217 --> 01:20:22,924
I mean, I've never even...

1416
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:24,355
You...

1417
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:26,899
Say something.
- What will he say?

1418
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:29,002
He's the one who told me.

1419
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:37,711
And that's Suicide Point...

1420
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:41,146
Every year 72 lovers
drown to death here.

1421
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:42,477
"Dreamgirl..."

1422
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,414
Your game's up, brother!

1423
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,783
And, I will make you pay for this.

1424
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,819
You will have to
clean up all this mess.

1425
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,557
And you can lag in loo.
- Slay in your limits, okay.

1426
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:54,150
You mind your limits, understood.

1427
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,862
Or else, I will really kick your a**

1428
01:20:57,153 --> 01:20:57,858
Sit down.

1429
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,228
Slap him, brother.
- Shut up.

1430
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,004
You've turned my life into a big joke!

1431
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:11,744
I've no place!

1432
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:19,247
I was quietly making
a road for myself.

1433
01:21:19,809 --> 01:21:21,584
Bul you just ruined everything.

1434
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:24,321
You made me divorcee...
- Quiet!

1435
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:26,420
Billi's mother wants
to make you her son-in-law.

1436
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:28,223
What else could I do? Tell me.

1437
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:30,430
Helped you instead.

1438
01:21:32,188 --> 01:21:34,668
I did what I thought was
right at that moment, that's it.

1439
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:37,870
What about my heart
that got shattered?

1440
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:39,669
What about that?

1441
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,140
Who told you to lock eyes with Rama?

1442
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,208
Just help me gel my love, and then...

1443
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,304
...you can go anywhere you want,
I don't care.

1444
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:51,345
You...you're such a selfish man.

1445
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:54,682
I mean...you can ruin anyone's
life for the sake of your life.

1446
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,021
lam done with being exploited.

1447
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:02,996
I tried my best to he your friend.

1448
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,130
Now, I will show you.

1449
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,125
Just watch...

1450
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,828
Tell me what you can do.

1451
01:22:12,128 --> 01:22:13,630
Nothing much.

1452
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:17,007
I will steal Billi
from right under your nose.

1453
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:20,612
Just watch.

1454
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,745
This hair slyle I gave
you is really amazing.

1455
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,279
But, have you seen
your face in the mirror?

1456
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:29,018
You can't even woo a boy.

1457
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:32,322
If girls only cared about looks...

1458
01:22:33,182 --> 01:22:35,287
...lhen half of the boys in India
would've still been bachelors.

1459
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:36,352
Understood.

1460
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:40,800
I will lake away Billi
from you...il's a dare.

1461
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:43,870
Let's imagine that you
do get married to Bitti...

1462
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:46,832
...then, I'll play the
trumpet at your wedding.

1463
01:22:46,896 --> 01:22:49,103
And I'll decorate the flowers.
Now gel losl.

1464
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,779
Better start preparing.

1465
01:23:00,743 --> 01:23:02,984
Brother,
he turned out to he a traitor.

1466
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,655
Trying to foil our plans.

1467
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:08,288
Billi will apply henna on her hands.
Nol cowdung.

1468
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:10,594
There's nothing he can do.

1469
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:13,489
Aunly, where is Billi?

1470
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:15,029
She is upstairs.

1471
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:18,997
Chirag, come here. Sit.

1472
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:24,203
Son, where does Billi
keep wondering at nights?

1473
01:23:24,934 --> 01:23:27,244
She's a girl after all, not a witch.

1474
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:29,982
Why don't you talk to her?
- Don't worry, aunly.

1475
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:31,309
I'll talk to her.

1476
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:34,147
Just make some lea. Hol...

1477
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:35,254
Okay.

1478
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:41,150
How are you, Rama?

1479
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:43,627
It's entirely my fault.

1480
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,323
I shouldn't have brought
that imbecile here.

1481
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:46,662
All he did was write a hook...

1482
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:47,996
...and now he lhink's
he's Ghalih (Poet)!

1483
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:49,863
Thank God Rama rejected him.

1484
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,331
Good for nothing...

1485
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:53,738
Letters for you...
and proposal for Rama.

1486
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,199
This is not the way.

1487
01:23:56,332 --> 01:23:58,403
You don't have to he sad, Billi.

1488
01:23:59,969 --> 01:24:01,346
Why would I he sad?

1489
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:06,383
He's just a divorcee
and not a murderer.

1490
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:09,647
Maybe she was a h***

1491
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,787
I didn't know Rama
would he such a fool.

1492
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,293
And, you're siding with Vidrohi instead.
- What else?

1493
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:17,963
Humiliale him like Rama did.
- How can you say that?

1494
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,363
Do you know everything that happened?

1495
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:20,626
No, you don't.

1496
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:23,193
A lot of people think
lam wrong, but...

1497
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:24,600
...does that make me wrong loo?

1498
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:29,900
You're not wrong for me, Billi.

1499
01:24:30,032 --> 01:24:32,034
So Vidrohi isn't wrong either.

1500
01:24:41,877 --> 01:24:42,912
Fine.

1501
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:49,694
Tea, son.
- Tea won't help anymore, aunly.

1502
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:50,828
Then why did you ask me to make one.

1503
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,830
Milk has become so expensive.

1504
01:24:53,956 --> 01:24:57,563
I wonder what Bitti
likes about that oaf.

1505
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:00,397
This is a one-sided competition,
brother.

1506
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:06,335
You didn't go to the office today.

1507
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:08,041
I look an off for Vidrohi.

1508
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:09,181
Come on.

1509
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:11,114
There goes your queen.

1510
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:12,915
Wowmamazing.

1511
01:25:12,975 --> 01:25:14,886
Come on, let's end this game.

1512
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:19,222
Just to he on the safer side,
you should say ‘I love you‘.

1513
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:22,828
You see, sometime even a rat...

1514
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:26,132
...can create obstacles
in a snake's path.

1515
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,961
Sarimhul I don't
know how to wear this.

1516
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:31,597
I know how to drape it.

1517
01:25:35,197 --> 01:25:39,043
I never imagined that
sari draper will pul one on me.

1518
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:41,608
Okay, brother.

1519
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:43,248
Hello.

1520
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:46,582
Vidrohi has opened
sari shop in Bareilly.

1521
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:54,152
Hello.
- Hello, Listen...

1522
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:55,660
You are fire from job.
Don't come now.

1523
01:25:55,718 --> 01:25:59,029
You can't fire me...l fire
you from the post of my boss.

1524
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,195
You can keep the money you
owe me and eat a cake.

1525
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:05,301
I should have told
Billi the truth...

1526
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:10,002
..that I am the author
of Bareilly Ki Barfi.

1527
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,145
And I wrote those letters.

1528
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:14,405
Hello son...

1529
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:22,720
You look smarter than
that Vidrohi, brother.

1530
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:31,494
Actually you look smart anyway,
brother.

1531
01:26:32,321 --> 01:26:34,358
Whether in a group or solo.

1532
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:38,027
You look handsome from every angle.

1533
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,368
You shouldn't make a noise
while eating, it's had manners.

1534
01:26:43,065 --> 01:26:44,043
Quite.

1535
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:46,770
The real fun in eating a malai malpuha
(Indian sweel) is when you make a noise.

1536
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:51,812
Up up chap chap (sounds)

1537
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,379
Together now... Chap haa...

1538
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:55,486
Vidrohi.

1539
01:26:56,078 --> 01:26:58,251
Does it matter whether
lam a virgin or not?

1540
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,126
Virgin? What's that?

1541
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:02,985
And, when I don't even
know what il means...

1542
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:04,223
...how can il bother me?

1543
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:06,960
Cheers to that.

1544
01:27:08,157 --> 01:27:09,659
Do you like watching films?

1545
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:11,834
I like watching English films.

1546
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:13,496
I see...
- Yes.

1547
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:15,766
Do you know English?

1548
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:18,774
I did once...

1549
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,007
...hl.ll, I didn‘! like il.
So, I sent il hack.

1550
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,344
Hold il properly.

1551
01:27:27,876 --> 01:27:31,449
The time to say
‘I love you‘ is gone.

1552
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:35,825
We just need to wail
and see who Billi chooses.

1553
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,320
Me...

1554
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:41,826
...or him.

1555
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:44,467
You had a problem when I was single.

1556
01:27:44,827 --> 01:27:45,862
And now, when I want to gel married...

1557
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:46,735
...you still have a problem.

1558
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:48,899
There is no problem, dear.

1559
01:27:49,398 --> 01:27:53,244
I never stopped you before, and
I won't stop you now either.

1560
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:58,215
Bulmlhink before
you lake any decision.

1561
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,616
What's to think?

1562
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:03,322
She's marrying a boy.
That's all that matters to me.

1563
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,253
Yeah, of course, you'll he happy.

1564
01:28:05,414 --> 01:28:06,415
Finally, you're gelling
rid of this headache.

1565
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:07,925
I have every reason to he happy.

1566
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,398
When your daughter's
slaying with you...

1567
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,297
...you keep thinking
when she will leave.

1568
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:17,770
And, when she's about to leave...

1569
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,339
...you can't stop thinking how
you're going to live without her.

1570
01:28:25,567 --> 01:28:27,444
Papa, I won't go if you start crying.

1571
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:29,243
Don't listen to him.

1572
01:28:29,505 --> 01:28:31,610
He has tears even
if someone pinches him.

1573
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:33,250
What's wrong?

1574
01:28:34,076 --> 01:28:36,078
Fine, I'll gel some
lea for you with sugar.

1575
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:37,716
Move, son.

1576
01:28:44,887 --> 01:28:45,831
Do you have a cigarette?

1577
01:28:53,429 --> 01:28:55,238
That you want to spend
the rest of your life with him.

1578
01:28:56,865 --> 01:28:58,367
All he did was write a hook.

1579
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,276
Well, il did matter before.

1580
01:29:02,171 --> 01:29:05,277
But now, it doesn't matter
whether he wrote that hook or not.

1581
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:11,115
All that matters now is that
Vidrohi is not a had guy.

1582
01:29:12,147 --> 01:29:15,617
He loves me and...
I'll he happy with him.

1583
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:18,196
Right?

1584
01:29:20,422 --> 01:29:21,867
Judging by the way you are, Billi...

1585
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:27,062
...you'll come across many more
people in life, who'll love you.

1586
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,470
Will you marry anyone?

1587
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:32,871
Which people are you talking about?

1588
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:36,074
Do you know how many
limes I've been rejected?

1589
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:39,816
Who is willing to marry me?

1590
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:44,790
You've loo have known
me for a long time now.

1591
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:47,983
Bul you didn't fall in love.

1592
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:54,558
I know I've certain faults, Chirag.

1593
01:29:56,425 --> 01:29:59,804
But if Vidrohi still likes me,
then what's the problem?

1594
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:02,805
Why would I have a problem?
- Then...

1595
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:08,448
My only advice is that
you shouldn't he hasty.

1596
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:10,583
Wh at h asly?

1597
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,781
Look, I've thought this through,
before making a decision.

1598
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:19,624
And please don't think I
am making a compromise.

1599
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:31,597
Catch.

1600
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:38,202
I told you I'll steal Billi
from right under your nose.

1601
01:30:39,701 --> 01:30:40,702
And I did.

1602
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:47,653
Our engagemenrs been fixed.

1603
01:30:52,481 --> 01:30:53,357
See you.

1604
01:30:54,349 --> 01:30:56,056
Regards to your mother.

1605
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:00,062
Stop it...
Let me catch my breath.

1606
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:02,896
I've been holding myself
hack for a long lime.

1607
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,527
If I let go,
you'll have nothing to hold on to.

1608
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:06,595
Bloody Vidrohi...
- Move.

1609
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,573
I'm destined to kill a bearded guy.

1610
01:31:13,302 --> 01:31:14,508
So slay away.

1611
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:20,813
You knew...how much I love Billi.
I loved her a lol.

1612
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,315
You used to call her sisler-in-law.

1613
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,690
Why did you betray me?

1614
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:29,354
Why did you do it?

1615
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:31,220
Did Billi love you?

1616
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:33,065
Huh?

1617
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:38,436
I loved Ramamhul she didn't.

1618
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:39,861
So, what should I do?

1619
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,501
Sit in a corner and cry like a woman?

1620
01:31:43,899 --> 01:31:45,139
Gel this through your skull...

1621
01:31:46,301 --> 01:31:48,338
Billi loves me.

1622
01:31:49,638 --> 01:31:50,708
Okay?

1623
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:55,353
Now, find someone else
for your ailing heart.

1624
01:31:56,378 --> 01:31:59,222
Because, if anyone now tries
to come between Billi and me...

1625
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:03,289
...l swear, I will make him pay.

1626
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:10,999
Do show up for the engagement, brother

1627
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,902
We haven't called
for the musical hand.

1628
01:32:17,599 --> 01:32:18,577
Listen...

1629
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:24,414
This altitude you're showing off...

1630
01:32:26,341 --> 01:32:28,150
It's my gift to you.

1631
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:32,351
And, when Bitti learns the truth...

1632
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:34,316
...she will kick you out.

1633
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,128
I see...

1634
01:32:37,519 --> 01:32:39,157
And, who's going to lell Billi?

1635
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:42,902
Your...hesl friend, or you?

1636
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:44,195
Who's going to lell her?

1637
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:49,334
Look...if I'm heartbroken

1638
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,138
I'll break everyone's heart.

1639
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:56,647
I won't let il happen again.

1640
01:32:59,441 --> 01:33:00,977
You will never change, brother.

1641
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:04,984
Fine, go lell her.

1642
01:33:12,854 --> 01:33:15,027
Why isn't the light glowing?

1643
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:17,566
The lighl glowing, uncle.
- Then, why can't I see it?

1644

Will shine clearly in the night.

1645
01:33:19,828 --> 01:33:21,466
I see, it will look better at night.

1646
01:33:21,863 --> 01:33:23,900
Then keep them closer,
show I've spent money.

1647
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:25,808
The lights should shine bright, ok .

1648

How am I looking?

1653
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,086
Very beautiful.

the norms of the world."

1689

"You're the grace in my eyes."

1690
01:36:22,744 --> 01:36:26,351
"Every breath I lake..."

1691
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:29,395
"...and in all my dreams..."

1692
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:34,660
"l see your prints everywhere I look."

1693
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:40,171

01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:43,435
"Love with you."

1695
01:36:46,868 --> 01:36:52,147
"O wanderer... I am in love..."

1696
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:55,311
"Love with you."

1697
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:12,904
"You're like the shadow
of a soaring bird."

1698
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:18,477
"The hoat that floats carelessly."

1699
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:25,244

1702
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:43,629

01:37:43,725 --> 01:37:49,141

"Love with you."

1711
01:38:36,444 --> 01:38:37,684
What did sisler-in-law say?

1712
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:41,516
I couldn't gather
lhe courage to lell her.

1713
01:38:41,683 --> 01:38:42,627
Why?

1714
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:45,889
She's very happy with Vidrohi.

1715
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:49,997
How could I break her heart?

1716
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,307
I was very selfish, Munna.

1717
01:39:01,703 --> 01:39:04,411
I couldn't see anything beyond
my happiness alone.

1718
01:39:06,241 --> 01:39:07,242
Well...

1719
01:39:09,377 --> 01:39:12,290
Love taught me to
he happy in olher's happiness.

1720
01:39:18,853 --> 01:39:20,992
And Vidrohi's not a had guy either.

1721
01:39:24,826 --> 01:39:27,067
You're not a villain, brother.

1722
01:40:02,931 --> 01:40:04,069
How are you, brother?

1723
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:08,146
Fine.

1724
01:40:09,404 --> 01:40:10,610

The function is upstairs.
- There's a problem, brother.

1751
01:41:50,538 --> 01:41:51,608
What's wrong with your voice.

1752
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:52,743

01:43:58,099 --> 01:44:01,979
"...hut I've enough to say about you
which can last an entire lifetime."

1794
01:44:05,473 --> 01:44:07,180
"Some think you're short-tempered."

1795
01:44:08,076 --> 01:44:09,453
"Some think you're spoilt."

1796
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:11,789
"Your mother amusingly says that..."

1797
01:44:11,846 --> 01:44:14,087
"...when you wander out at nights,
you look like a witch."

1798

"But I swear,
I like everything about you."

01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:31,243
Oh, God. What just happened?

1802
01:44:34,435 --> 01:44:36,472
Oh no, not another power-cut.

1803
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,914
He was reading
such a romantic letter.

1804
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:40,610
See...

1805
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:41,981
There's a power cut
in the entire city...

1806
01:44:42,076 --> 01:44:43,077
...hul power will he
restored soon enough.

1807
01:44:43,144 --> 01:44:44,646
We regret the inconvenience caused.

1808
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:50,693
You're very strange.

1809
01:44:54,021 --> 01:44:56,023
Every time you laugh,
your front loolh's visible.

1810
01:44:58,059 --> 01:45:00,061
Even your gums light up.

1811
01:45:02,029 --> 01:45:03,565
Every time you cry,
your nose starts running.

1812
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:06,544
You gel happy without a reason...

1813
01:45:06,601 --> 01:45:08,410
...and lose your temper
over trivial things.

1814
01:45:11,773 --> 01:45:13,650
It's not easy to love you.

1815
01:45:16,076 --> 01:45:19,285
But, it's harder to not love you.

1816
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,994
You're like this light in my life.

1817
01:45:37,732 --> 01:45:43,478
And no one in this world,
can love you as much as I do.

1818
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:48,585
Let's make a hel.

1819
01:45:51,746 --> 01:45:54,056
And, if I lose...you
can lake anything you want.

1820
01:45:58,185 --> 01:45:59,664
Will you marry me?

1821
01:46:21,409 --> 01:46:22,547
Yes.

1822
01:46:24,178 --> 01:46:25,714
Come, Vidrohi.

1823
01:46:32,787 --> 01:46:34,630
How long are you going to hide it?

1824
01:46:39,227 --> 01:46:42,106
I know who wrote Bareilly Ki Barfi.

1825
01:46:43,998 --> 01:46:45,500
Along with all those letters.

1826
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:48,844
I know everything.

1827
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:52,106
But, who told you?

1828
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:57,311
Munna?

1829
01:46:57,445 --> 01:46:58,617
I am not a traitor, brother.

1830
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:00,454
lam on your side.
I don't know.

1831
01:47:02,116 --> 01:47:04,687
Yes, son,
I just found out a few days ago.

1832
01:47:04,952 --> 01:47:07,660
And we started preparing since then.

1833
01:47:08,856 --> 01:47:09,994
Then...

1834
01:47:12,126 --> 01:47:13,366
Vidrohi.

1835
01:47:14,362 --> 01:47:16,069
Vidrohi got emotional.

1836
01:47:17,164 --> 01:47:19,542
When I tried to console him,...

1837
01:47:20,635 --> 01:47:21,978
...he spilled out everything.

1838
01:47:22,303 --> 01:47:24,283
‘Chirag is the author
of Bareilly Ki Barfi‘.

1839
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:25,975
‘These lwo got me in this mess.‘

1840
01:47:29,043 --> 01:47:31,580
You could've told
me if you already knew.

1841
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:33,588
Bul I didn't know...

1842
01:47:34,148 --> 01:47:39,826
...whelher you really love me,
or maybe because...

1843
01:47:39,887 --> 01:47:41,662
...you see Bahli in me.

1844
01:47:43,023 --> 01:47:45,697
And il was very important
for me to find out.

1845
01:47:48,195 --> 01:47:50,004
Hence I played this charade.

1846
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:57,575
Through Mr. Bishnoi we hooked...

1847
01:47:57,905 --> 01:47:59,907
Oh no...

1848
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:04,278
‘Cheers to that.‘

1849
01:48:05,446 --> 01:48:06,584
You didn't fall in love with me.

1850
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:08,853
I tested you at every step.

1851
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:11,120
Bul you passed every lesl.

1852
01:48:12,353 --> 01:48:14,299
I troubled you a lol, didn't l?

1853
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:18,295
Sorry.
- Don't say sorry.

1854
01:48:20,261 --> 01:48:22,366
Billi, here you go.

Adorn it.

1856
01:48:24,565 --> 01:48:28,411
But, I don't have one.
I didn't come prepared.

1857
01:48:28,536 --> 01:48:29,981
What will he adorn?
- Brother Chirag.

1858
01:48:30,271 --> 01:48:31,409
Look at him.

1859
