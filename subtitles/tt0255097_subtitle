Love, love and love.

Just tell me.

6
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,018
The crazy one.

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,485

Love, love and love.

15
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,497
What is this pain?

16
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:46,467
What is this dream?

17
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:51,839
What's this unknown thirst?

18
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:58,412
That which is hidden in
the beats of the heart.

19
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:03,025
That which has come
out today, what's it?

20
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:06,088
l stay awake.

21
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:09,429

22
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:21,638
l don't know what it
is that l remain lost.

23
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:26,714
My dear heart, tell me just this.

24
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:30,041

25
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,985
Love, love and love.

00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,428
ls this called love?

34
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:23,530
Love, love and love.

35
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,044
Good morning.
- Good morning. Come.

36
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:37,510
The dead body of Nandu is there.

37
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:38,745
See this.

38
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:40,913
Good morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.

39
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:47,820
They killed him too.

40
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:49,989
He was supposed to unmask them all.

41
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,960
Sir, we got this important
message for you from his pocket.

42
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:18,359
Hello sir, Nandu has reached
hell and his body must've been..

43
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:22,295
..found by the police by now.
The video tape that he was..

44
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,458
..using to blackmail
you is with me now.

45
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:28,369
Yes, sir, l'll bring it now.
Come on, darling.

46
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:41,650
Where is Jimmy?
- Yes, who are you?

47
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:50,987
Do you have the licence for this?
- You, police?

48
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:54,520
You seem to be sensible.

49
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:56,923
Shall we go to Jimmy?

50
00:08:00,403 --> 00:08:01,461
Yes, sir.

51
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:04,604
Yes, darling l'll marry
both of you. - You liar..

52
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:06,334
..two marriages and two honeymoon.

53
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,413
Okay, both of you leave now.
- Bye.

54
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,615
The licence for this
casino is in your name.

55
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:21,584
But from appearance you
don't look like the real owner.

56
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,293
Tell me, who is that
who does criminal..

57
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:26,487
..activity through you here?

58
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:30,596
Criminal activity? No sir,
they just gamble here. You see.

59
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,629
Nandu died taking the
name of your casino.

60
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:35,895
Why?

61
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,039
lt is a good club, sir and
the gambling is good here.

62
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:41,303
There is no limit gambling here.
You too should play and..

63
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:42,844
..everything will be
free for you here.

64
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,909
Then come, let's go to the
police station and play there.

65
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:49,473
There everything will be
free for you. No limit.

66
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,317
The punches, kicks
and the rest of it.

67
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:57,749
What're you hiding?
- Tape, sir.

68
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:02,555
What's in this tape?
- Normal recording about the club.

69
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:03,990
Give it to me.

70
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:07,495
Come on.
- Get lost.

71
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:15,701
Boys! Beat him up.

72
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,021
Darling!

73
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,837
The romance at an old
age is very bad, daddy.

74
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:52,701
You must be the one
who is old or you father.

75
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:53,899
Baby!

76
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:57,377
You're our father.
- This is your mother..

77
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,539
..with whom l'm romancing.

78
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,818
Stepmother, but she is good.

79
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,117
Look, darling. Look
how your sons look at me.

80
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:10,887
You also wear such clothes,
sister-in-law.

81
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,094
Darling!
- He is jealous of us.

82
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,829
He is not married so
he's jealous of us.

83
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:18,389
lf some people in the
world marry twice then some..

84
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,695
..will have to
remain bachelors like me.

85
00:11:19,768 --> 00:11:22,532
So many famous men in this world
have two wives, isn't it baby?

86
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:26,329
Brother, our hair is similar,
our cheeks are similar and..

87
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:29,900
..the way we walk is similar,
then why didn't l get a wife?

88
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:33,681
l'm also a famous man.
- Because our brain is not similar.

89
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,841
Moreover you're not a famous man.
Move on. - Okay. - Okay.

90
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,614
My hair is falling
because of the tension.

91
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:40,344
Why are you taking tension?
Jimmy has said that..

92
00:11:40,422 --> 00:11:42,788
..the tape is with him. Sit down.

93
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,519
Why is he not coming with the tape?

94
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:51,891
Will you burn my backside?

95
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:55,360
Uncle, this was a sample. lt
is fortunate that you didn't..

96
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:58,998
..sit on the chair nearby. - Do
you know what would've happened?

97
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,433
What would've happened?
- This.

98
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:05,371
Fools, you both will..
- Sit down..

99
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:08,644
..there is no bomb in that.
- Ruin me.

100
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:12,451
Daddy, this Jimmy
always brings bad news.

101
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:15,888
We'll put a bomb beneath him too.
A big one. - There will be no Jimmy..

102
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:17,450
..and there will not
be any bad news too.

103
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:20,461
Keep quiet. Both of you are
always under the influence of drugs.

104
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,061
Go and make bombs, guns and arms.

105
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:23,457
We have to send a consignment. Go.

106
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,657
Dad, take it easy.
- Sir.

107
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:29,403
Sir, there is bad news.

108
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,339
What happened?
- That tape is with..

109
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,742
..Vishal and our
casino is destroyed.

110
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:38,776
Twenty people have been
killed and the rest arrested.

111
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,972
l will not leave
you alive, you idiot.

112
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,017
Scoundrel. ldiot.

113
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:46,952
Scoundrel.

114
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:51,488
Daddy, take it easy.
- Brother.

115
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:55,562
My real face even my people
mustn't have seen and now Vishal.

116
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:58,361
Sir, listen to me. l had
thrown that tape in the fire..

117
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,664
..and it might have
been burnt by now.

118
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,028
Daddy, that means that we're saved.

119
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,039
That's it.
- Darling, please.

120
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:08,838
Don't try to mix
romance in violence, go away.

121
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:12,637
Son!
- Don't touch my wife.

122
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:16,907
That means that Vishal
will get that tape repaired.

123
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:21,311
Vishal, this cassette
has been totally damaged.

124
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:23,989
That's why l've brought it
to you. You can repair it.

125
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:29,761
Yes, with the use of computer
graphics. But it'll take time.

126
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,391
Time is what l don't have with me.

127
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:36,437
l'm sure that there is some
mystery hidden in that tape.

128
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:43,803
Sir. - Well-done,
Vishal. l'm proud of you.

129
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,880
You have once again
proved that you're the best.

130
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,346
ln my thirty year of
service l've not..

131
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,078
..seen a brave officer like you.

132
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:52,483
You're an ideal
example for our police force.

133
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:54,617
The whole police force on one
side and you on the other side.

134
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:57,450
You've wiped out
crime from this city.

135
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:02,624
No, sir. There is one gang
whose backbone is still not broken.

136
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,356
But they will surely be
destroyed shortly since the..

137
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,799
..main clue against
them has reached my hands.

138
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:09,662
Good.
- l'll keep you informed, sir. Bye.

139
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:19,972
Mama, get me some tea.
- You'll not get it.

140
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,009
Then get me some coffee.
- You think that this is a joke.

141
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:25,448
Why did you risk
your life again today?

142
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,381
Mama, the commissioner
has put me on desk duty.

143
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:30,056
He makes me do
clerical work on the table.

144
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,723
ls it? Then what's this, brother?

145
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:38,333
C.B.l. officer Vishal raids
a casino in a daring style.

146
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,561
Bloody news papers.
- Why, Vishal, why?

147
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:45,067
Now it is enough. God
has given us everything.

148
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:53,346
Mama, you know why l
joined the lndian police force.

149
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:57,350
Yes. Some rouges had
kidnapped your father and..

150
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,388
..asked for ransom and
he was killed by them.

151
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:04,823
But for that will you keep
risking your life forever?

152
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:06,856
Were those rouges
not ultimately killed?

153
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:11,399
That's why this
fire was never doused.

154
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:14,627
l find the face of my
father's killer in every criminal.

155
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:19,805
Mama, let me do what l'm doing.

156
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,399
l find peace in it.

157
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,811
There is magic in your
hands and in your voice.

158
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:28,741
Whether it's criminal or
mother you have them captivated.

159
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:32,846
Do it. But don't play with
your life like it's a toy.

160
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:35,379
Mama. Nothing will happen to me.

161
00:15:35,657 --> 00:15:37,784
Mama, you bring the one who
will take care of brother.

162
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,520
Then brother will do
everything the way she wants.

163
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,325
Yes, Vishal, you get married.

164
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,791
Mama, will she agree?

165
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,798
The one who is waiting
for him from five o' clock.

166
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:50,472
What do you mean?
- Oh God!

167
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:51,832
Mama, coffee cancelled. l
was supposed to go to a movie..

168
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:52,965
..with Sapna for the 6 to 9 show.

169
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:55,071
Brother is great!

170
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:57,340
He keeps bashing up the
people all around the world..

171
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:59,607
..but today he will get bashed up.
- Shut up.

172
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,544
Dear, by now, it must
be intermission there.

173
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,444
You don't add fuel to fire.

174
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:09,958
You say whatever.. here he comes.

175
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:11,354
She was waiting for him
till he didn't come and now..

176
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:13,621
..when he has come the
sister has gone to the bedroom.

177
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:15,424
l'm coming to open the door.

178
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:18,527
Hello uncle, hello aunt.
- Hi. Hello.

179
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,658
- Hi. You're again late, son.

180
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,303
l got late running behind
criminals. You also come..

181
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:24,305
..with me someday and it
will be an outing for you.

182
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:27,298
ls there any danger, son.
- No, just that l have drive at a..

183
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:28,434
..speed of 200 and there could be..

184
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,772
..some small scratches, that's all.

185
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:31,369
Small scratches are no problem.

186
00:16:31,547 --> 00:16:33,845
Some times the criminals
shoot and l could get shot.

187
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:36,477
Only small scratches, l hope.
- No, l could get killed too.

188
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:38,913
But someone can die while
crossing the road too, uncle.

189
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:42,323
Sapna. - That's why.. - That's why
l don't go out of the house at all.

190
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:44,383
Sapna.

191
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:48,520
Sapna.

192
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,359
When you've finished
breaking things come down.

193
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:02,341
ls Sapna still angry?
- One should be scared of the..

194
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:05,346
..women but one should
never show it. - Yes.

195
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:13,082
Look, try it some time.
- Yes, a good tip. Why not.

196
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:18,357
Dhanwanti.
- What's it? - Make some snacks.

197
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:20,085
Make it yourself.

198
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:30,294
Hey, doll! - Don't call
me by my childhood name.

199
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:33,033
Then you're still angry.
- Do you know how to cajole?

200
00:17:33,575 --> 00:17:37,033
l'm weak in that. Why don't
you correct your mood yourself?

201
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,038
Vishal!
- Come on, dear, l love you.

202
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:44,476
l know.

203
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,695
Vishal, l want to go
to the disco. Come on.

204
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,825
Come on. Disco is for the children.
- No, it is for the youth.

205
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:02,369
The hot blooded youth. You know.

206
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:03,863
Sapna, l don't know how to dance.

207
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:06,601
Once you dance with me
you'll forget to walk. Come.

208
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:09,570
lf he doesn't want to come
then come with me, baby.

209
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:10,703
Thank you, man.

210
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:12,436
Leave me, man.
- Vishal! - What did you say?

211
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:13,879
Leave me, man.
- Vishal! - Please.

212
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:17,009
Will you ever ogle at someone?
- Leave me, man.

213
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:22,285
What happened to you?
- When someone even looks..

214
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:27,693
..at you my blood gets boiling.
We're also hot blooded, baby.

215
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:29,354
Hot blooded.

216
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:35,528
Luckier than me is that
criminal whom you hugged like this.

217
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:39,300
Why don't you hold me like that?
- Stop it, Sapna, let's go.

218
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:44,308
Vishal, praise me.
Tell some verses about me.

219
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:45,704
Verse?

220
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:52,044
'You're the full moon.'

221
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:54,012
'Or are you the light itself?'

222
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:56,448
'Whatever you're, my dear.'

223
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:58,015
You're beyond comparison?
- Yes.

224
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,552
Not like this. Tell
me something original.

225
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:03,320
The whole day l'm with
criminals and none of..

226
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:08,700
..them now poetry.
- Never mind. l'll teach you.

227
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:12,373
Look at my eyes.
- Looking.

228
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:15,805
Now tell me, how much you do.
- What?

229
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:17,870
Love, Vishal.

230
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,010
As much as you love me
buddy add 10% to that.

231
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,881
Go, l don't want to dance.
- What happened?

232
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:32,426
Be romantic, Vishal.
- Okay, give me a minute.

233
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:35,321
l'll think of such a verse
that will floor you. - Okay.

234
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:46,034
Hello. Give him to slaps
and he'll spill it all out.

235
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:49,704
Rane, your baton has gone cold.

236
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:53,647
What rubbish, Rane? l'm just coming.

237
00:19:55,884 --> 00:19:57,909
What? Start dancing. Come on play.

238
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:01,480
Vishal, you said
that we'll be together.

239
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:02,614
Sorry, l've urgent work.

240
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:03,749
Always it's urgent work.

241
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:05,723
Sapna seems to have come back early.

242
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:09,889
lt's started. The
fireworks in love have started.

243
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:13,460
l remember our days, darling. You..

244
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,337
You go and sit there.
- This Hitler will never change.

245
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:21,767
Why don't you go and talk about
the marriage to Vishal's mother?

246
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:24,812
How can l talk? l feel very shy.

247
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,519
l'm not talking about your
marriage but Vishal's marriage. Okay!

248
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:35,346
Once they get married
then the workaholism..

249
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,981
..in Vishal will disappear.

250
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:39,853
He will also become
henpecked husband like me.

251
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:42,527
What did you say?
- Sapna.

252
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:49,632
Got something to eat?
- Chocolates. - l will get fat.

253
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:56,472
Biscuits. Biscuits. - l will
remain hungry, but l guess it'll do.

254
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:04,809
Sister, what is love?

255
00:21:06,054 --> 00:21:08,045
Love? You have to eat
air and be happy in love.

256
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:09,885
You don't get any food in love.

257
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:16,487
No, love is a world of dreams.
- What? What?

258
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:21,591
When someone is in love
then only one name is uttered.

259
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:25,329
Then?
- When you're with him..

260
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:28,843
..you don't realise
how time ticks by.

261
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:33,480
Then?
- That's all. You only wait for him.

262
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:34,873
You don't like anything at all.

263
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:36,982
Love takes you to heaven.

264
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,353
l'll give you one tight
slap and you'll come down..

265
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:40,786
..straight from
the coconut tree top.

266
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:42,351
Why? What's wrong in that?
- You've started reading a lot..

267
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:44,358
..of novels these days.
These are only found in novels..

268
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:47,020
..and in movies and stories.
Nothing like this happens.

269
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:49,830
Anyway, Nimmo, now go and study.

270
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,957
Sister, tell me one thing.
- What?

271
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:56,369
What do you like in Vishal?
- Oh Vishal!

272
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,406
He is so daring and stylish.

273
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:03,602
Love is falling for a
daring police officer.

274
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:07,448
The one who leaves his lover
to go and meet a criminal.

275
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:12,650
Sister!
- Nimmo! Come on, studies.

276
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:13,847
Sister, please.
- Come on. - Come on.

277
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:16,887
Where is your brother?
- Brother.

278
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:19,058
What made you come
to our house today?

279
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,685
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Greetings.

280
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:23,322
You never come to my house
so l came to yours today.

281
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:26,396
Why will he come to our house,
brother? What've we done?

282
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:29,332
Uncle is scared of
brother Vishal since he is..

283
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:32,339
..in the secret police.
- There must be some thief hidden..

284
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:36,343
..inside uncle.
- l'm so innocent that l have..

285
00:22:36,411 --> 00:22:38,402
..not been able to
get married till date.

286
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:41,748
You mean that l'm some thug
that l've got married twice?

287
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,443
Nekoo! Darling, leave it.

288
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:46,577
Uncle, you've not given me the
party for your second marriage.

289
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:49,755
Tell me. For that you've to
come to my house. Tell me when.

290
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,359
Uncle, l'm after some criminal
and l have got some evidence..

291
00:22:53,428 --> 00:22:56,363
..against them. ln a few
days they will be behind bars..

292
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:58,661
..and then both of us can party.

293
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:02,367
Where are you going?
- Police conference, Shimla.

294
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,680
Brother, where is this Anand house?
- That way.

295
00:23:17,852 --> 00:23:19,114
There? Yes! Okay!

296
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,887
See l'm already bothered and why
are you following me. Go away.

297
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:31,390
Go. Go away.

298
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:33,331
He has a stomach-ache.
He swallowed..

299
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:38,031
..the bone instead of chewing it.
- You're a vegetarian.

300
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:42,943
See l don't see patients on
the road. Come to my dispensary.

301
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:44,069
Okay?

302
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:46,746
Look, l'm looking for Anand house.
Pooja has called me.

303
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:48,573
Try to understand my problem.

304
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:52,413
Go now.
- What is he, human or an animal?

305
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:57,354
Brother, where did you tell me
this house was? - First tell me..

306
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:58,949
..whether you're a
human or an animal?

307
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:01,618
Are these your eyes or buttons?
Can't you see that l'm a man?

308
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:03,357
My name is Okay. - l can see
that you're a man but it seems..

309
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:05,365
..that you're a dog
in the guise of a man.

310
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:06,725
You called me a dog?

311
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:08,029
Yes. Dog. You called me a dog?
- Yes.

312
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,628
You called me a dog?
- Yes.

313
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:12,566
Leave the human beings
we'll take you to Anand house.

314
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,904
Thank you very much. These
dogs are better than you.

315
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:16,435
Get lost. Get lost.

316
00:24:16,511 --> 00:24:17,842
Get lost. Get lost. Get lost.

317
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:21,711
The off springs of humans!
Come, Pooja. Pooja.

318
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:26,352

Come on, girls.

323
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:44,701
Something for you, hot or cold.
Coffee or tea? - Anything.

324
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,344
Who is he? What is this?

325
00:24:52,414 --> 00:24:53,472
What're you doing?

326
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:58,451
Now l know why you called
me here. To dance, isn't it?

327
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,345
No, l didn't call you to dance here.

328
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:02,481
Now you said come on dance. Pooja..

329
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:03,615
..l didn't call him here.
- Now she said dance and..

330
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:04,817
..now she tells that
she didn't call me.

331
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,761
l'm so sorry,. l'm so sorry,
girls. lt must've been a mistake.

332
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:11,958
Okay, done.

Coming.

334
00:25:22,877 --> 00:25:24,868
You've come again?
- You just now called me to dance..

335
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:26,470

Why is your name Okay?

341
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,322
That is a long story. Before me
my mama had a lot of children..

342
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:44,695
..and all of them were lame,
dumb or handicapped in some way.

344
00:25:47,402 --> 00:25:49,768

Where is Arun?
- l don't know. - 1 , 2, 3, 4..

351
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,356
Great! lf some girl would've
given me so much importance..

352
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:15,760
..then l would've sat at
her doorsteps like a dog.

353
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,459
Okay!
- l will have to search.

354
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:33,570
Wow.
- Beautiful.

355
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:35,775
Can l play at your table?

356
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:43,989
This is the only table
where one chair is vacant.

357
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,651
l've never seen you before.

358
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:49,657
Arun is my name. Arun.
- Arun what?

359
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,322
Do you want to know my
entire family details when..

360
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,526
..some even don't know
the details of the parents.

361
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:56,866
Hey, scoundrel! Have you
come here to make money? Get up.

362
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:00,899
Listen. Don't abuse.

00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:42,307
He is losing for forty minutes.

370
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:45,046
- Forty minutes! Why
didn't you tell me before?

371
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:13,946
Tell me how you
started winning so much?

372
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:19,352
For the first half hour l was
losing because l was studying..

373
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,287
..all of you. When you get bad
cards you start scratching like..

374
00:28:22,357 --> 00:28:28,660
..this. You arrange your
muffler and you start drinking.

375
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,296
And you, when you get good
cards you press your hands..

376
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:36,826
..and she starts smoking.
- This is cheating.

377
00:28:37,372 --> 00:28:39,465

gambling is this written?

378
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:43,873

Sheru what?
- l'm the don of this area.

381
00:28:52,387 --> 00:28:57,324

00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:58,859
..about them, understood?

383
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:02,658
So you're Sheru, isn't it?

l was just joking.

395
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:49,403
This is all your money, take it.

You bashed up that baldy
and sent him to the hospital.

00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:29,445
He brought a real gun.

You've become a poetess. - lt

Tell her.

Tell me, what do you steal? Hearts?

424

Okay say it sells in the market.

The more you try..

516
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:44,481
lf they want to
meet they have to meet.

517
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:46,417
When you're attacked
by the virus of love.

518
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:48,352
lt's like an arrow

519
00:37:48,422 --> 00:37:50,049

lf they want to
meet they will meet.

524
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:08,432
Vishal, we were waiting as to when..

525
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:09,703
..you'll get
transferred to this place.

526
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:11,335
On big gang of criminals
are due to get caught and..

527
00:38:11,412 --> 00:38:14,006
..after that my transfer will
be to this place. - ls that so?

528
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:19,349
Arun!

529
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,815
Did you look behind?
- l did.

530
00:38:25,926 --> 00:38:28,759
So, tonight.
- Yes, tonight.

531
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:32,890
You pluck the fuse.
- You whisk away the goods.

532
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:36,493
- Okay. - Okay, let's go.

533
00:39:08,602 --> 00:39:09,660
There is he. There is he.

534
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,897
Let us hand him over to the police.

535
00:39:13,007 --> 00:39:14,702
The idiot was stealing and
running away. - Take him.

536
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:28,288
From Vishal says it is clear
that he has given that cassette..

537
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:31,290
..for repair to someone. lf
Vishal returns to this city..

538
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:33,553
..then it will announce our death.

539
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,295
Will you all keep staring me or..

540
00:39:37,364 --> 00:39:38,626
..will make
arrangements to kill him?

541
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:40,366
Go and make
arrangements to kill him.

542
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:43,436
Don't worry dad, Vishal will not
live. Come on, brother. Let's go.

543
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:51,776
Darling! Now violence is
over and romance will start.

544
00:39:52,646 --> 00:39:54,910
Will you feed me with grapes?
- Sure, darling!

545
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:57,975
Hi, brother.
- Hi. Hi. Hi.

546
00:39:58,686 --> 00:39:59,744
How was your journey to Shimla?
- lt was good.

547
00:40:00,454 --> 00:40:02,319
Why are you all here?
- Strange! They have come with..

548
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:03,947
..the formal proposal for
your and Sapna's marriage.

549
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:06,319
From here we'll go straight to the..

550
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:07,792
..priest to fix the auspicious day.

551
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:10,859
Son, are you
agreeable to this proposal?

552
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:14,866
lf l refuse then
Sapna will bash me up.

553
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:19,068
You were unnecessarily bothered.
- Hello.

554
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:23,775
Vishal, some faces are
coming out but they're not clear.

555
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,570
Maybe l'll recognise them.
l'm coming now.

556
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:29,346
What do you think? - Okay,
Vishal l suggest that you also..

557
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,351
..come to the priest's place.
- Yes come. Come. Come.

558
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:34,614
One minute, One minute,
have you all asked Sapna?

559
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:38,590
She is here, ask her.
- Yes, go and ask.

560
00:40:39,994 --> 00:40:44,363
Hey doll, will you marry me?
- Vishal, at least on this..

561
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:46,524
..occasion don't call
me by my childhood name.

562
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:52,628
l'm sorry, what should we do?
- When did l object?

563
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:59,540
Vishal. - Yes,
commissioner. Yeah, l'm coming.

564
00:41:02,516 --> 00:41:04,484
There was a strange incident
with me at Shimla. - ls it?

565
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:08,382
On thief broke into my hotel
and when l shone the torch..

566
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:12,448
..on him his face looked
exactly like mine. - My God!

567
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:22,561
l want to inform you
about that unknown gang.

568
00:41:22,903 --> 00:41:24,768
Nandu told something
important while dying.

569
00:41:25,406 --> 00:41:27,601
l got some clue from that.
- What clue?

570
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:36,506
One video cassette which will
be in my hands soon. - ls it?

571
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:40,748
ln that..
- What happened?

572
00:41:41,555 --> 00:41:43,819
Vishal! Vishal you were telling..

573
00:41:44,658 --> 00:41:45,716
Vishal!

574
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:48,652
Oh my God!

575
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:12,412
Doctor, just tell me that
Vishal is alive. - Yes, he is.

576
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,486
Thank God!
- But he is alive for name sake.

577
00:42:16,723 --> 00:42:20,386
He has gone into coma.
Whether he'll come out of..

578
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:25,023
..the coma alive and when
he'll do so no one can say.

579
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:29,334
Doctor, no one should know
what's happened to Vishal..

580
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:33,339
..and what condition he is. lf
this news spreads in the city..

581
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:35,875
..then there will be
havoc spread and..

582
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:42,581
But my heart tells me that
nothing will happen to Vishal..

583
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,408
..and Vishal will get well soon.

584
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:47,343
l can appreciate your emotions,
commissioner and..

585
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:50,356
..also accept miracles do happen.
But only one in a..

586
00:42:50,424 --> 00:42:52,585
..thousand get up
from this deep sleep.

587
00:42:57,798 --> 00:43:00,392
Cheers! Cheers!
- Cheers, brother.

588
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:05,101
Dad, dad, after Vishal's death
there is a gang war in the city.

589
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:06,904
Dad, there is a chaos all around.

590
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:09,033
Let it happen. Blast
out all the small gangs.

591
00:43:09,476 --> 00:43:11,376
Set the city on fire.

592
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:13,571
Come on, dad.

593
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:29,787
Raja, sent the
consignment of weapons fearlessly.

594
00:43:39,706 --> 00:43:41,936
lf the police try to stop
you then blast them too.

595
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:50,413
Hello. - Why is all this
loot and arson going on?

596
00:43:50,484 --> 00:43:51,917
What's the police doing?

597
00:43:51,985 --> 00:43:53,543
Will you please keep quiet?
- Do you have any reply at all?

598
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,611
Will you let me talk to you?
- You'll have to answer us.

599
00:43:58,525 --> 00:44:01,358
Yes. - Sir, Vishal's
mother wants to talk to you.

600
00:44:02,996 --> 00:44:05,021
Tell her that
l'm busy in a meeting..

601
00:44:05,098 --> 00:44:07,032
..and l'll ring her up later.
Okay, sir.

602
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:11,995
How long will l hide the
truth from Vishal's mother?

603
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,431
Tomorrow l'll go and
tell her the truth.

604
00:44:17,978 --> 00:44:20,378
Brother, where is Vishal?
- You don't get up. The doctor has..

605
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:22,574
..said that you
shouldn't move around.

606
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,011
That.. - lf it is something
we should know then tell us.

607
00:44:27,554 --> 00:44:28,714
We will handle the sister-in-law.

608
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:31,514
No, it is nothing like that.
l spoke to him just morning.

609
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:38,496
Means, he is alright?
- Yes. ls he alright?

610
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:43,736
ls he alright?
- Of course, he is alright.

611
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:45,328
He is hale and healthy.

612
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:47,339
He is hale and healthy.
For security reasons he's..

613
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:50,808
..not allowed to phone anyone.
Not even to you.

614
00:44:51,044 --> 00:44:53,569
When will he come?
- lt'll take some time.

615
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:56,845
But l'll try that he comes soon.
- Okay.

616
00:44:57,017 --> 00:44:59,383
You take care of your health.
- Okay. - Now l'll take leave.

617
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,547
You keep us informed about Vishal.
- Okay. - We too. - Yes.

618
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:08,622
Thanks a lot, God!

619
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,424
Brother, l'll go to
the temple and come.

620
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:21,705
Brother. - Don't worry.
Even the God is smiling.

621
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:25,041
Because he also knows
that Vishal is with him.

622
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:28,309
l also know that the
commissioner has told a lie.

623
00:45:28,615 --> 00:45:31,778
But why? - Looking at the
health of this old woman.

624
00:45:32,486 --> 00:45:35,319
So that she doesn't die
hearing the news of her son's death.

625
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:39,482
There was this strange
incident with me at Shimla.

626
00:45:41,328 --> 00:45:45,321
One thief broke into my hotel
and when l shone the torch..

627
00:45:45,399 --> 00:45:46,696
..his face was exactly like mine.

628
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,332
Hello, make arrangements for me
to go Shimla tomorrow morning.

629
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:26,871
So what've you decided? - For a
million, l'm even ready to die.

630
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:32,706
Okay, it's alright. The
commissioner is also not in town.

631
00:46:34,715 --> 00:46:38,446
My heart says that he
must've gone to get brother Vishal.

632
00:46:38,518 --> 00:46:39,576
Who knows?

633
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:47,049
Come on, Arun, buck up. Come on.

634
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:52,361
l've already run 10 kilometres.
- 5 more left, come on.

635
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:55,827
l can't do it.
- Come on, Arun.

636
00:46:56,036 --> 00:46:59,494
Arun! 1 million! 1 million!

637
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:08,938
God knows what all he will make
me do for 1 million. Let's go.

638
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:14,353
Just got saved. lf you don't
drive the jeep properly then..

639
00:47:14,421 --> 00:47:15,752
..how ill have you become Vishal?

640
00:47:15,822 --> 00:47:18,347
l was all these days
running before police jeeps and..

641
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:20,359
..now you've put me inside one.
Will it not take time, sir?

642
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:24,831
Okay, Arun, careful! To the right.
What're you doing, Arun?

643
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:25,956
Chuck it, buddy.

644
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:41,610
Hello, my papa is
not home. Ring later.

645
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:45,450
Did you think that
it was Vishal's phone?

646
00:47:46,553 --> 00:47:48,043
What all danger he
keeps playing with.

647
00:47:48,588 --> 00:47:51,022
At least he should ring up.
Are we not worried?

648
00:47:52,592 --> 00:47:54,389
Don't worry. l'm
sure that he is trying.

649
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:14,905
He's done it.

650
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:23,918
Look, Arun. Whatever l knew
about Vishal, l've told you.

651
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:28,519
ln my opinion you're now
totally ready to take his place.

652
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:32,694
Arun.
- Sir. - What are you thinking?

653
00:48:35,302 --> 00:48:37,293
On this bag, sir.
l have never seen..

654
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,998
..1 million rupees
together till date.

655
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:42,733
l was thinking that..

656
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:45,300
No, tell l finish
telling you everything..

657
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:49,576
..you will not even touch the bag.
- Chuck it, buddy.

658
00:48:51,718 --> 00:48:53,686
No Arun, you'll not touch that bag.

659
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:57,321
But sir, how do you see me?
- For you it is a mirror from..

660
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,449
..that side but l
can see you through it.

661
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:03,319
Now the time has come that l tell..

662
00:49:03,396 --> 00:49:06,695
..you everything
about Vishal's family.

663
00:49:09,402 --> 00:49:10,767
Sir, Ms. Sapna wants to meet you.

664
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:12,737
- Okay send her in. - Okay, sir.

665
00:49:13,406 --> 00:49:15,340
Arun, you go inside fast.
- But..

666
00:49:15,475 --> 00:49:17,409
- Don't waste time. Go inside fast.

667
00:49:24,017 --> 00:49:27,953
Come dear, what will
you have to drink?

668
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:30,581
l've not come here to
drink something but..

669
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,420
l know Sapna.
- Sapna!

670
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:37,629
Excuse me. Hello. One minute.

671
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:40,524
No.

672
00:49:41,968 --> 00:49:45,369
l told CM. ls PM also coming?

673
00:50:30,784 --> 00:50:32,342
Okay, keep me informed.

674
00:50:33,053 --> 00:50:36,648
Uncle. - Sapna, Sapna, you
don't have to say anything.

675
00:50:36,723 --> 00:50:37,781
He is coming tomorrow.

676
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:40,422
Really.
- Absolutely real.

677
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:42,492
Shall l take this as a promise
from you that he is coming tomorrow?

678
00:50:42,562 --> 00:50:44,427
A real promise and
maybe today itself.

679
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:48,523
Thanks uncle, thank
you so much. Bye. - Bye.

680
00:50:51,504 --> 00:50:52,562
Arun.

681
00:50:56,543 --> 00:50:58,773
Saw it. This is called coincidence.

682
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:02,047
Today l was planning to tell
you about Vishal's family..

683
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:03,882
..and look how Sapna landed up here.

684
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:13,492
She is Vishal's lover.
- Vishal's lover. Sapna? - Yes.

685
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:16,859
Get her face planted in
your memory very well.

686
00:51:17,797 --> 00:51:19,128
You will have to meet her often.

687
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:24,860
This is where l'm scared
that you'll get trapped.

688
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:34,079
How Vishal met Sapna and how
he talked to her l don't know.

689
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:38,544
She should never come to know
that you're not her real lover.

690
00:51:42,022 --> 00:51:44,547
Arun, are you still
lost in your thoughts?

691
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:50,029
Okay, till you see the money..
- Sir.

692
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:59,097
Now Vishal is standing before you.
Tell me, what do l have to do?

693
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:01,974
Brother! Brother.

694
00:52:02,575 --> 00:52:04,975
Brother.

695
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:06,103
Why is this uncle shouting?

696
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:10,640
Listen to me and
forget this grapes vendor.

697
00:52:11,551 --> 00:52:13,075
What happened? - Look what is
happening in the world around.

698
00:52:13,386 --> 00:52:15,445
Why are you getting
annoyed seeing my grapes?

699
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:20,049
What's wrong with you?
- We've been destroyed.

700
00:52:20,126 --> 00:52:23,323
Watch the TV, come.
- What happened? - Come fast.

701
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:29,459
Brother, be quick and come
and see. Come. Look at this.

702
00:52:36,843 --> 00:52:39,676
This must be an old recording.

703
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:42,610
Not old but it is
written live there.

704
00:52:42,682 --> 00:52:44,946
Brother-in-law,
pronounce live correctly.

705
00:52:45,418 --> 00:52:48,945
What ever it is pronounced
as out life is now in danger.

706
00:52:49,422 --> 00:52:51,083
lt is being shown in
every channel. Look here.

707
00:52:51,491 --> 00:52:55,359
Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you aware
of the crime increasing in the city?

708
00:52:55,762 --> 00:52:56,922
Where were you for such a long time?

709
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:58,361
How much do you hold
yourself responsible..

710
00:52:58,431 --> 00:52:59,625
..for this increase
in the crime rate?

711
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:01,867
As much as l find you responsible.
- What do you mean?

712
00:53:02,368 --> 00:53:04,359
You wrote so much about me
that the criminals went into..

713
00:53:04,437 --> 00:53:07,372
..hiding underground
fearing me. To bring them out..

714
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,431
..l also had to go
into hiding underground.

715
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,536
l have been
successful in my objective.

716
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:15,876
They have come out in such a way
that l recognise each face now.

717
00:53:16,716 --> 00:53:18,479
l want to tell them only one thing.

718
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:21,318
That they admit their
crime before the law.

719
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:26,891
Or else..
- What happened, uncle?

720
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,327
Brother, he'll not let
us live. He will kill us.

721
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:34,565
You fools, who did you
kill instead of Vishal?

722
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,066
l'm not able to bear it anymore.

723
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:39,930
Dad l'm not able to understand it.
We killed him with our hands.

724
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:42,600
Then is this his ghost?

725
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,408
How many times l've told you
not to work when you're drugged.

726
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:53,417
lf you had killed him
then how did he come alive?

727
00:54:05,532 --> 00:54:10,060
Look, after coming all traces of
Arun in you should be given away.

728
00:54:10,937 --> 00:54:15,374
There is a mother inside who is
waiting impatiently for her son.

729
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:17,508
Now you're that son.

730
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:20,774
The orphans don't have relations.

731
00:54:21,714 --> 00:54:23,306
What a mother is or
what a sister is..

732
00:54:24,617 --> 00:54:25,777
..l've never known from childhood.

733
00:54:26,853 --> 00:54:30,653
lf you slip of somewhere
l'll let you know. Come.

734
00:54:33,459 --> 00:54:36,792
Sister-in-law,
Sister-in-law, see who has come.

735
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:38,688
Who? Vishal!

736
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,758
Vishal!

737
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:51,340
Where did you go away?

738
00:54:52,412 --> 00:54:53,902
Neither did you phone
nor did you send word.

739
00:54:54,747 --> 00:54:56,612
Do you know how we were living here?

740
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:08,685
Mama!

741
00:55:19,806 --> 00:55:23,367
Brother Vishal,
you're back home. Yes!

742
00:55:24,444 --> 00:55:26,878
Brother! Brother! Brother!
- Mad girl.

743
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:31,380
Brother! Promise me that
you'll never leave us go from today.

744
00:55:31,751 --> 00:55:33,048
No, not like this.
You've to promise me.

745
00:55:33,786 --> 00:55:35,981
Okay, l promise that l'll
leave you all and go from today.

746
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:38,050
One promise you've to
give sister Sapna also.

747
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,823
You know how much she missed you.

748
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,622
You must go and meet her today.

749
00:55:43,529 --> 00:55:47,363
Mama. l've. - No, you
shouldn't torture someone like this.

750
00:55:55,074 --> 00:55:57,907
Hello, aunt.
- Sapna, look who has come.

751
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:02,345
Son, it is good that you've come.
Our eyes were yearning to see you.

752
00:56:02,448 --> 00:56:05,349
Where did you vanish? - Actually..
- He has come. My lion has come.

753
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:08,785
Come, Come, there is a problem.
Sapna is very annoyed with you.

754
00:56:10,023 --> 00:56:12,491
Then all of you help me.
- Help!

755
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:17,596
What happened? Have you
forgotten all that you told me?

756
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:21,028
What did l say? l've forgotten.

757
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:24,825
Forgotten? Why is that my lion
has become a fox like me today?

758
00:56:25,405 --> 00:56:28,431
Uncle, before the girls you're
not to be a lion but a poet.

759
00:56:28,508 --> 00:56:31,443
Poet? What is wrong with you?
Are you alright, son?

760
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:36,414
l was just joking.
- Joking. Go upstairs.

761
00:56:36,883 --> 00:56:40,546
Knock the door. Be scared
but don't show it on you.

762
00:56:48,628 --> 00:56:49,686
Sapna.

763
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,460
Nimmo is there some city in
lndia where there is no STD.

764
00:57:32,038 --> 00:57:34,666
Sapna.
- No mummy, l was just asking.

765
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:37,808
l'd heard that after 7.30 p.m.
the rates are halved.

766
00:57:37,877 --> 00:57:39,708
Yes and after 8.30 p.m.
the rates are one third.

767
00:57:39,779 --> 00:57:41,644
Right, exactly.

768
00:57:41,714 --> 00:57:45,912
Not only that after 1 1 in the night
it is on fourth.

769
00:57:46,386 --> 00:57:48,320
There are some misers who
can't even spend that much..

770
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:51,323
..money to make a phone call.
- Forgive me for security..

771
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:54,519
..reasons l couldn't ring you up.
- Did he tell me something?

772
00:57:54,827 --> 00:57:57,955
Someone ask him whether he'll stand
here or are we going somewhere.

773
00:57:58,531 --> 00:58:00,396
Go. Go. Go..

774
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:10,341
Will you not ask me whether l'm
angry or not? - Are you angry?

775
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:13,940
Yes, l'm angry. Will
you not ask why? - Why?

776
00:58:14,947 --> 00:58:19,782
Because l know that you love
me but you're already married.

777
00:58:21,554 --> 00:58:24,955
Marriage? With whom?
- With your work.

778
00:58:27,593 --> 00:58:31,620
Then l'll divorce it.
- What? Yes!

779
00:58:32,899 --> 00:58:36,630
That which comes between me and
my love will have to be removed.

780
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,565
What are you saying?
What's wrong with you today?

781
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,001
Did l say something wrong?

782
00:58:45,678 --> 00:58:49,307
Listen, are you drunk?

783
00:58:51,317 --> 00:58:52,375
lt is a long time since l've seen..

784
00:58:52,452 --> 00:58:54,044
..a bottle and now
l'll drink at all.

785
00:58:55,755 --> 00:58:58,451
Now l get the stupor just like that.

786
00:59:06,332 --> 00:59:11,565
l though that you've changed.
But you've not. - Thank God!

787
00:59:12,371 --> 00:59:14,703
What's this, Vishal?
Again the same hotel?

788
00:59:17,076 --> 00:59:19,840
ls this not the place
that you and l always come?

789
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,010
Yes, we do, Then come.
- Come.

790
00:59:36,896 --> 00:59:39,990
l'm sorry, sir. Sorry, madam.

791
00:59:42,301 --> 00:59:45,031
What happened?
- You almost killed him that day.

792
00:59:46,038 --> 00:59:49,633
Oh l forgot.
- Vihsal, the disco, let's go.

793
00:59:51,377 --> 00:59:55,973
Come on. - Really? - Let's go.
- l love you. Love you.

794
01:00:28,447 --> 01:00:31,712
Vishal, why don't you come
to the disco, You dance well.

795
01:00:32,618 --> 01:00:33,676
What.

796
01:00:35,555 --> 01:00:38,388
l was just joking. Let's
have something to eat.

797
01:00:41,761 --> 01:00:45,561
What'll you have?
- Come on.

798
01:00:50,903 --> 01:00:53,030
What'll you have?
- l'm not hungry.

799
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,098
Strange, even l'm not hungry.
Otherwise l'm hungry every half hour.

800
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:00,036
So, what happened now?

801
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,645
l'm filled with love. - Where
did you learn to talk like this?

802
01:01:06,786 --> 01:01:08,720
Did l say something wrong again?

803
01:01:10,656 --> 01:01:14,057
Keep saying things wrong. l like it.

804
01:01:16,729 --> 01:01:17,787
Sapna.

805
01:01:24,537 --> 01:01:25,595
Nothing.

806
01:01:26,806 --> 01:01:32,073
Vishal, l've seen such
depth in your eyes before.

807
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:36,947
Come on, let's dance.

808
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,478
Actually, where has Arun gone.

809
01:01:43,356 --> 01:01:45,415
A commissioner Chauhan has
taken him out of this city.

810
01:01:45,825 --> 01:01:47,952
That too l came to know
from one of my spy dogs.

811
01:01:49,962 --> 01:01:51,623
l've a lot of money
that l saved from my show.

812
01:01:52,498 --> 01:01:53,624
We will search for
Arun and find him.

813
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:55,491
What will happen to my patients?

814
01:01:56,035 --> 01:01:58,094
Okay, you will get your
dogs and cats there too.

815
01:01:58,704 --> 01:02:00,365
What friend are you? You
don't seem to be bothered about..

816
01:02:00,439 --> 01:02:02,373
..your friend at all. - lt is
not like that, ln the matter of..

817
01:02:02,441 --> 01:02:03,840
..friendship l'm more
faithful than the dog.

818
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:05,702
l will find out Arun.

819
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:13,108
Hello.
- Sapna. - Vishal!

820
01:02:13,452 --> 01:02:16,421
Hi, what's the matter? How
is that you phoned me up?

821
01:02:16,656 --> 01:02:17,782
That too at this time of the day?

822
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:23,053
l had something
important to do so l phoned.

823
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:26,388
What no work? That too for you?

824
01:02:26,866 --> 01:02:28,857
Where have all the
criminals of this city gone?

825
01:02:29,001 --> 01:02:30,468
They are all mourning my come back.

826
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:33,061
Anyway will they be
reformed if l get behind them?

827
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:37,739
lt is better than going
behind them that l take you out.

828
01:02:38,744 --> 01:02:39,802
What?

829
01:02:44,684 --> 01:02:46,015
What happened? Are
you listening to me?

830
01:02:46,952 --> 01:02:53,824
Yes, l'm listening. But l can't
believe that you're the same Vishal.

831
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:59,364
Why? - You took me to the
disco for the first time..

832
01:02:59,432 --> 01:03:02,367
..yesterday and you put off the
mobile too. Now you've called..

833
01:03:02,435 --> 01:03:04,699
..and asking for me
to come out with you.

834
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,700
Wow! This is great. What
has happened to you Vishal?

835
01:03:16,515 --> 01:03:19,575
l don't know Sapna,
what has happened to me?

836
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,455
Listen. Evening seven, be ready.

837
01:03:30,796 --> 01:03:32,923
Sister Sapna, don't
have so many dreams.

838
01:03:33,399 --> 01:03:35,924
Since he is seeing you after a
long time he is cajoling you.

839
01:03:36,068 --> 01:03:37,330
Have a bet that today also he will..

840
01:03:37,403 --> 01:03:39,462
..take you only to
his favourite spot.

841
01:03:40,005 --> 01:03:44,738
You mean.. - Yes, the same
boring ball room dancing.

842
01:03:54,687 --> 01:03:55,813
Where have you brought me today?

843
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:57,547
A rose for a rose.

844
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,086
This place and the people here
you shall always remember. Come.

845
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:22,371
Come.

846
01:04:36,996 --> 01:04:40,329
Stop it. Nothing sir,
we were just joking.

847
01:04:40,399 --> 01:04:44,062
Hide it, we don't have the licence.

848
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:47,595
Don't worry. l have not come
here to bring you back to senses.

849
01:04:49,809 --> 01:04:50,935
l have myself come
here to lose my senses.

850
01:04:53,078 --> 01:04:54,375
Then come.

851
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:01,614
Drink this and you'll also
become senseless like me.

852
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:03,755
Give one to madam too.
- Take care of him.

853
01:05:04,957 --> 01:05:06,481

854
01:05:06,826 --> 01:05:10,762
You also have it.
- Me? Vishal. - lt is orange.

These eyelids.

861
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:13,820

You've not become
crazy just like this.

01:08:05,604 --> 01:08:09,005
Some where a magical
spell has been cast on you.

This physique.

917
01:10:24,543 --> 01:10:26,067
This fantasy.

918
01:10:26,478 --> 01:10:28,070

919
01:10:28,614 --> 01:10:30,013

What will you have?

931
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:12,386

..in Vishal's condition.
- ls it?

933
01:11:14,459 --> 01:11:17,656
No, nothing to increase
our hopes of his recovery.

934
01:11:18,463 --> 01:11:21,660
He has uttered some name once,
probably a girl's name.

935
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:26,001
Sapna?
- Yes, probably that was it.

936
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:31,874
That means that he.. - No,
commissioner, nothing can be said now.

937
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,409
As long as he is alive
the hopes are also alive.

938
01:11:45,023 --> 01:11:49,756
My dear heart, tell me this much.

942
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:07,504

No, just a little love.

948
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:34,869
Nimmo, it appears that l have
fallen in love with Vishal again.

949
01:12:41,346 --> 01:12:42,404
Don't cast an evil eye on me.

950
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,408
Sister!

951
01:12:47,019 --> 01:12:49,886
Excuse me, sir. Give me this bag.
- lt's alright.

952
01:12:50,355 --> 01:12:53,347
This is a police station and not
a railway station, Give it to me.

953
01:12:53,425 --> 01:12:56,417
That's why. - What? - No, l
have full faith in you. Come.

954
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,364
Yes. - We have come from
Shimla to enquire about..

..out friend Arun.
- Arun? Who Arun?

956
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,570
You'll not remember. You

01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:20,518
Will you listen to me?
- Arun is not such a type of boy.

961
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:21,913
Will you shut up?
- You please leave him.

962
01:13:22,321 --> 01:13:23,515
Shut up.
- l fall at your feet. - Shut up.

963
01:13:24,656 --> 01:13:25,782
What's your name?
- Okay, sir.

964
01:13:26,325 --> 01:13:28,054
Nothing is okay, what's your name?
- Okay.

01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,651
What okay?
- No what only Okay, sir?

01:13:30,929 --> 01:13:32,362
What are you saying

967
01:13:32,664 --> 01:13:33,790

Okay.
- Thank you, sir. Did you call me?

970
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:45,603
Okay, you seem to have
some misunderstanding.

971
01:13:46,545 --> 01:13:49,946
What name did you say
of your friend? - Okay.

972
01:13:50,415 --> 01:13:53,543
Oh no, not yours but your friend's.

973
01:13:53,752 --> 01:13:54,810
Arun, sir.

974
01:13:56,355 --> 01:14:00,621
Look l don't know your Arun not
have l brought him from Shimla.

975
01:14:04,496 --> 01:14:05,554
Are you not able to believe me?

976
01:14:05,697 --> 01:14:06,755
Nothing like that, sir.

977
01:14:07,099 --> 01:14:09,966
Don't misunderstand me, sir.
l actually don't..

978
01:14:10,902 --> 01:14:13,427
l'm not able to say it. l hope
you're able to understand it.

979
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:17,636
l'm the police commissioner and
you think that l'm telling a lie.

980
01:14:18,043 --> 01:14:20,102
No, it is not like that. For
the police the people say that..

981
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:22,579
..the bigger the
officer the bigger..

982
01:14:23,715 --> 01:14:26,047
l'm not able to say it,
sir. l hope you've understood.

983
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:30,052
Yes, the jail here is very big
and it has a lot of vacant place.

984
01:14:30,655 --> 01:14:35,649
lf you ask about Arun once more
then.. l'm not able to say it.

985
01:14:36,395 --> 01:14:38,795
But you..
- l've understood it, sir.

986
01:14:38,997 --> 01:14:40,055
Then l'll send you to the jail.

987
01:14:40,932 --> 01:14:42,331
You send me to the jail,
sir. Because not once but..

988
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:44,733
..l'll ask you a
hundred times, where is Arun?

989
01:14:45,404 --> 01:14:49,067
You've been put on that jail
to help us and not to bully us.

990
01:14:49,741 --> 01:14:53,074
What's this you've started?
He is not in the Shimla jail.

991
01:14:54,346 --> 01:14:56,871
When we come here you tell us
that you don't even know him.

992
01:14:58,417 --> 01:15:02,353
lf he is a prisoner then
punish him. But to his own people..

993
01:15:02,421 --> 01:15:06,482
..tell him where he is
serving his term of punishment.

994
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:09,017
What are you to him?

995
01:15:13,632 --> 01:15:17,432
Nothing. But he means a lot to me.

996
01:15:18,837 --> 01:15:20,964
l will bring the
heavens down to find him.

997
01:15:24,976 --> 01:15:26,307
She will get us jailed.

998
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:30,641
Look they are my guests. Take
them to the police guest house.

999
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:34,442
Right, sir.
- l can understand your worries.

1000
01:15:35,454 --> 01:15:39,356
Give me a few days time and l
shall find about him and tell you.

1001
01:15:40,392 --> 01:15:41,450
Thank you, sir.
- Now both of you go.

1002
01:15:42,394 --> 01:15:43,793
Come.
- Sir, is it the guest house?

1003

Yes, cantonment. l

Yes, M.G. road,

Yes, l'll come in the evening.

cassette is. - Cassette.

1049
01:18:38,036 --> 01:18:39,970
We have now come to know
where our cassette is.

1050
01:19:02,394 --> 01:19:04,055
Where is he?
- Seems he has run away.

1051
01:19:05,997 --> 01:19:08,329
He must be dead. l've
shot two bullets into him.

1052
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,867
Come let's go.

1053
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:18,600
Darling!

1054
01:19:23,014 --> 01:19:25,881
This scoundrel has
made me sleepless.

1055
01:19:27,619 --> 01:19:31,020
l will get the scoundrel killed.

1056
01:19:34,759 --> 01:19:35,817
What're you thinking?

1057
01:19:37,962 --> 01:19:41,295
You know, mother and Babli
were telling me yesterday that..

1058
01:19:41,366 --> 01:19:43,027
..you've changed.

1059
01:19:47,372 --> 01:19:49,033
They asked me and l
also agreed with them.

1060
01:19:50,642 --> 01:19:51,700
Why did you agree?

1061
01:19:52,644 --> 01:19:53,702
lt is true, isn't it?

1062
01:19:54,512 --> 01:19:58,642
Mother wanted to ask the
commissioner where he sent you.

1063
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:01,043
That you've left the old
Vishal there and come.

1064
01:20:03,588 --> 01:20:06,056
Now l'm also convinced that..

1065
01:20:07,459 --> 01:20:10,053
..you're not the
same Vishal that l knew.

1066
01:20:20,338 --> 01:20:21,396
You seem to have
really got scared as..

1067
01:20:21,473 --> 01:20:22,997
..if you're not
Vishal and someone else.

1068
01:20:24,008 --> 01:20:25,066
l was only joking.

1069
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:29,879
To tell the truth we
are all very happy that..

1070
01:20:30,548 --> 01:20:31,606
..you changed so much.

1071
01:23:01,499 --> 01:23:03,091
Did you find the route
to get out from here.

1072
01:23:03,768 --> 01:23:05,963
No, we are trapped in an island.

1073
01:23:06,905 --> 01:23:09,100
There is water on all
four sides and nothing else.

1074
01:23:10,775 --> 01:23:11,833
Then it is good.

1075
01:23:17,115 --> 01:23:19,049
Such a cool breeze is blowing.

1076
01:23:23,421 --> 01:23:24,649
l'll try to get the fire started.

1077
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,523
lf the fire doesn't
get started, then?

1078
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:31,385
Today l'll even set
the water on fire.

1079
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,731
l know it. The one who
can set fire the heart..

1080
01:23:41,739 --> 01:23:43,001
..what is water to him.

1081
01:23:59,557 --> 01:24:01,081
lt seems the
lighter will let me down.

1082
01:24:02,694 --> 01:24:04,025
l bless this lighter.

1083
01:24:06,764 --> 01:24:08,356
lf the lighter doesn't
light will you look for..

1084
01:24:08,433 --> 01:24:10,765
..alternative
treatment for my chillness?

1085
01:24:39,864 --> 01:24:42,526
This is wrong.
- Are you waiting for the marriage?

1086
01:24:44,402 --> 01:24:45,460
Who knows about the wedding?

1087
01:24:46,604 --> 01:24:47,866
l don't trust myself anymore.

1088
01:24:49,073 --> 01:24:52,406
l'm helpless. - When you stole
my heart where you not helpless.

1089
01:24:53,745 --> 01:24:55,076
Then also l was helpless
at the hands of my heart.

1090
01:24:56,014 --> 01:24:57,811
Why don't you
understand my helplessness?

1091
01:24:58,416 --> 01:24:59,474
l'm constrained.

1092
01:25:00,952 --> 01:25:02,749
lf you torture me any more then.
- Then?

1093
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:06,884
l will bite and chew
you with my teeth.

1094
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:33,704
What should l do? My heart
is not getting convinced.

1095
01:26:34,378 --> 01:26:36,846
lt is a crazy one.
Don't let it get impatient.

1096
01:26:37,381 --> 01:26:48,986
Lest it doesn't come to senses,
don't give it such a stupor.

1097
01:26:49,927 --> 01:26:55,866
l have kept it hidden inside
my heart for such a long time.

1098
01:26:56,467 --> 01:27:02,064
lt is not very informed as
to what is love is all about.

1099
01:27:02,673 --> 01:27:04,072
Don't steal my heart.

1100
01:27:05,743 --> 01:27:07,005
Don't steal my heart.

1101
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,541
Don't steal my heart.

1102
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:13,544
Don't steal my heart.

1103
01:27:15,686 --> 01:27:21,556
lt is a crazy one.
Don't let it get impatient.

1104
01:27:22,026 --> 01:27:27,692
Lest it doesn't come to senses,
don't give it such a stupor.

1105
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:34,369
l have kept it hidden inside
my heart for such a long time.

1106
01:27:34,839 --> 01:27:40,505
lt is not very informed as
to what is love is all about.

1107
01:27:41,045 --> 01:27:42,444
Don't steal my heart.

1108
01:27:43,314 --> 01:27:45,509
Don't steal my heart.

1109
01:27:47,652 --> 01:27:48,846
Don't steal my heart.

1110
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:51,852
Don't steal my heart.

1111
01:28:19,817 --> 01:28:25,483
This is such an inspiring place.

1112
01:28:26,357 --> 01:28:31,954
When l see you my body is melting.

1113
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:38,034
Time has become lustful
after touching which.

1114
01:28:38,836 --> 01:28:44,570
My love has so much fire in it.

1115
01:28:45,576 --> 01:28:50,980
Don't torture me and try
to understand my emotions.'

1116
01:28:51,716 --> 01:28:55,311
lt is the overflowing
desires and the thirsty heartbeat..

1117
01:28:55,386 --> 01:28:57,445
..what can l do?

1118
01:28:57,788 --> 01:28:59,050
Don't steal my heart.

1119
01:29:01,058 --> 01:29:02,355
Don't steal my heart.

1120
01:29:33,357 --> 01:29:39,023
Neither you're to be
blamed not it is me.

1121
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:45,700
These are the
outcome of crazy love.

1122
01:29:46,304 --> 01:29:51,833
Let me spread
myself out in your arms.

1123
01:29:52,443 --> 01:29:58,575
Let me cross all limits today.

1124
01:29:58,916 --> 01:30:04,513
What's it that your
eyes have told my eyes?

1125
01:30:05,056 --> 01:30:08,321
Let me control myself,
what's this stupor that's..

1126
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:10,917
..taken over me this moment?

1127
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:12,924
Don't steal my heart.

1128
01:30:13,731 --> 01:30:15,926
Don't steal my heart.

1129
01:30:38,356 --> 01:30:41,951
Coming. Come on.

1130
01:30:45,763 --> 01:30:52,100
Nimmo.
- Hi sister, how are you?

1131
01:30:53,904 --> 01:30:55,701
l'm alright?
- Why are you gasping?

1132
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,705
l'm on top of the world.

1133
01:30:58,042 --> 01:30:59,100
You were absolutely right, Nimmo.

1134
01:30:59,577 --> 01:31:03,513
You were right about everything.
- About what?

1135
01:31:03,714 --> 01:31:05,773
About love, Nimmo.

1136
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:08,712
You know all your novels were right.

1137
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,920
Every story and every
description was right.

1138
01:31:14,058 --> 01:31:15,116
Love is heaven.

1139
01:31:15,726 --> 01:31:16,784
Love is heaven.

1140
01:31:17,728 --> 01:31:22,529
lt is a dream world. Every
heart beat takes only his name.

1141
01:31:24,335 --> 01:31:27,532
The depth that l
saw in his eyes, wow!

1142
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:30,673
Why did l not see that before?

1143
01:31:31,942 --> 01:31:35,002
Careful - Why did l not
see that before, Nimmo?

1144
01:31:36,347 --> 01:31:39,077
The day went by like a few seconds.

1145
01:31:40,017 --> 01:31:44,750
Now l only wait for him.
When will he come?

1146
01:31:45,556 --> 01:31:48,548

1147
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,618

01:31:51,295 --> 01:31:53,490
l love Sapna.

1149
01:31:57,168 --> 01:31:59,159
Morning.
- Good morning.

1150
01:31:59,236 --> 01:32:00,362
Hi, junior.

1151
01:32:00,437 --> 01:32:01,631
Good morning.

1152
01:32:05,776 --> 01:32:08,108
Sir, did you call me?

1153
01:32:08,179 --> 01:32:10,238
Arun, there is good news for you.

1154
01:32:10,714 --> 01:32:12,238
Vishal has regained consciousness.

1155
01:32:17,588 --> 01:32:21,786
You can't believe it, isn't it,
Arun? But it is the truth.

1156
01:32:21,859 --> 01:32:23,121
This is the truth.

1157
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:24,589
The God has answered our prayers.

1158
01:32:24,728 --> 01:32:26,662
Doctors say that this is a miracle.

1159
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:28,128
lt's a miracle.

1160
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:30,133
But my heat has
always told me that..

1161
01:32:30,201 --> 01:32:31,532
..nothing will happen to my Vishal.

1162
01:32:31,602 --> 01:32:35,538
He is a fighter and he has won
the battle against death too.

1163
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:39,264
You don't have to play this
drama of being Vishal for long, Arun.

1164
01:32:40,277 --> 01:32:41,608
Vishal will be back soon.

1165
01:33:14,578 --> 01:33:17,775
l have kept Vishal here, far
from the eyes of the world.

1166
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,524
Hello Vishal, nice to see you.

1167
01:33:31,262 --> 01:33:32,524
Morning, sir.
- Morning, Vishal.

1168
01:33:32,596 --> 01:33:34,393
How are you feeling today?
- Perfectly fine, sir.

1169
01:33:34,465 --> 01:33:35,523
That's my boy.

1170
01:33:38,269 --> 01:33:40,794
By the way Vishal, he is Arun.

1171
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:44,265
How are you thief?

1172
01:33:45,409 --> 01:33:48,674
Commissioner has told me everything.
l take pride in your bravery.

1173
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,410
You risked your
life to become Vishal.

1174
01:33:55,286 --> 01:33:56,617
l like brave men.

1175
01:33:59,223 --> 01:34:02,624
Don't praise me so much. l
was a man from the streets.

1176
01:34:04,228 --> 01:34:07,095
l got the chance to live
with your name for some time.

1177
01:34:08,365 --> 01:34:12,358
After getting your name
l had forgotten my name.

1178
01:34:13,237 --> 01:34:14,295
Shall we go home, Vihsal?

1179
01:34:15,306 --> 01:34:16,637
Come, let's go.

1180
01:34:31,522 --> 01:34:34,457
What happened?
- When mama comes..

1181
01:34:34,525 --> 01:34:37,722
..to know the truth l hope
she doesn't get a shock.

1182
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:41,321
That why l have
called Sapna's family too.

1183
01:34:41,398 --> 01:34:43,127
There will be a joyful atmosphere..

1184
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,599
..and your mother will
be immersed in that.

1185
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,202
Thank you Sapna,
you've made a good coffee.

1186
01:34:54,611 --> 01:35:00,743
Vishal!
- Mama! - What's happened to you?

1187
01:35:02,753 --> 01:35:09,420
Why are you behaving as if
we're meeting after months?

1188
01:35:09,493 --> 01:35:11,427
He is meeting you after months.
- Meaning?

1189
01:35:12,763 --> 01:35:14,697
Not only with you
but with all of us.

1190
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,559
What's he saying, Vishal?

1191
01:35:18,635 --> 01:35:21,695
Yes, the enemies
attacked him months back.

1192
01:35:22,773 --> 01:35:27,437
He had gone into a coma. A
long period of unconsciousness.

1193
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,504
Coma? But he was meeting us daily.

1194
01:35:31,582 --> 01:35:36,519
That was not Vishal and this
should remain a secret amongst us.

1195
01:35:38,188 --> 01:35:40,588
Arun.
- Arun?

1196
01:36:11,555 --> 01:36:13,614
For months it was
Arun meeting you all.

1197
01:36:14,491 --> 01:36:16,152
To get control over the criminals.

1198
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,425
To keep the fear of
Vishal alive in them.

1199
01:36:19,163 --> 01:36:20,687
lt was me who make Arun into Vishal.

1200
01:36:25,169 --> 01:36:28,229
Have all of you been fooled?
You did a fantastic job, Arun.

1201
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:35,312
One doesn't get dreams while in
coma but l dreamt about you, Sapna.

1202
01:36:36,246 --> 01:36:37,304
How are you, doll?

1203
01:36:38,849 --> 01:36:40,111
Vishal!

1204
01:36:52,129 --> 01:36:54,063
This is actually a happy occasion.

1205
01:36:54,131 --> 01:36:57,726
Whatever Vishal had to undergo is
over. Now he is perfectly alright.

1206
01:36:57,801 --> 01:36:59,462
That's why l always
thought why he didn't remember..

1207
01:36:59,536 --> 01:37:02,061
..what me and Vishal discussed.

1208
01:37:02,139 --> 01:37:04,073
l used to talk about the lion
and he used to talk about poetry.

1209
01:37:04,141 --> 01:37:06,075
Anyway you act very well.

1210
01:37:07,344 --> 01:37:10,609
Still l would like to thank, Arun.

1211
01:37:11,281 --> 01:37:14,273
You took care of us very
well in the absence of Vishal.

1212
01:37:19,156 --> 01:37:22,489
Yes, l'm also thankful
to you. Thanks, buddy.

1213
01:37:24,361 --> 01:37:27,091
My future son-in-law
has come back from..

1214
01:37:27,164 --> 01:37:29,632
..the jaws of death.
Champagne will flow.

1215
01:37:32,169 --> 01:37:33,363
How much are you feeding him?

1216
01:37:33,437 --> 01:37:34,563
l will reach the hospital again.

1217
01:37:34,638 --> 01:37:36,367
Don't talk about the hospital.

1218
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,170
Where is Arun? He hasn't
brought the plate yet.

1219
01:37:39,243 --> 01:37:42,508
Sister-in-law after sweetening the
mouth it will be made bitter too.

1220
01:37:42,579 --> 01:37:44,240
Get champagne glasses for all.

1221
01:37:44,314 --> 01:37:49,047
Yes!
- Brother-in-law.

1222
01:37:52,256 --> 01:37:56,124
Sapna.
- Talk respectfully.

1223
01:37:56,727 --> 01:37:59,252
Address me respectfully.

1224
01:38:00,664 --> 01:38:03,064
How dare you even look at me?

1225
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,662
What did you think about me?

1226
01:38:05,269 --> 01:38:07,066
l love Vishal from here.

1227
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:10,338
l hold him and his
principles at a high reverence.

1228
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:14,075
You man of the street
and you tried to be Vishal?

1229
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,202
You listen..
- Shut up.

1230
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:20,139
l don't even want to know who you're.
For me my Vlshal is everything.

1231
01:38:20,217 --> 01:38:22,617
What is your identity is
of no importance to me.

1232
01:38:50,113 --> 01:38:51,171
Arun.

1233
01:38:55,519 --> 01:38:59,182
Spectacle!

1234
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:03,251
What's this spectacle?

1235
01:39:10,467 --> 01:39:11,593
The national anthem of love.

1236
01:39:14,137 --> 01:39:16,662
l too want to talk
about love to you.

1237
01:39:21,144 --> 01:39:24,671
What is love no one will know it
better than me at this moment.

1238
01:39:24,748 --> 01:39:26,613
Tell me.

1239
01:39:27,484 --> 01:39:31,614
Arun. Love..

1240
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:39,292
Love? Love is Sapna.

1241
01:39:44,635 --> 01:39:46,227
Sapna?
- Yes, Sapna.

1242
01:39:46,637 --> 01:39:48,434
First she said that l'm spectacular.

1243
01:39:49,706 --> 01:39:56,635
Then she said don't steal my heart.
O also said, don't steal my heart.

1244
01:39:58,382 --> 01:40:03,183
But she was the one
who stole my heart.

1245
01:40:04,588 --> 01:40:11,050
Then today she kicked
me off like this that..

1246
01:40:11,128 --> 01:40:17,067
..l enjoyed it.
- Arun! - Don't say anything.

1247
01:40:17,734 --> 01:40:20,726
Arun, l can understand your pain.
- You will not know.

1248
01:40:23,206 --> 01:40:27,074
This pain is only known to
someone who has fallen in love.

1249
01:40:28,545 --> 01:40:34,415
Yes, l never fell in love.
- Never do it.

1250
01:40:49,599 --> 01:40:57,028
My beloved threw flower at me.

1251
01:40:57,574 --> 01:41:06,039
My soul was weeping continuously.

1252
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:15,052
l never felt the pain of the..

1253
01:41:15,125 --> 01:41:20,791
..stones thrown by others.

1254
01:41:22,799 --> 01:41:26,291
My beloved threw flower at me.

1255
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:32,404
My beloved threw flower at me.

1256
01:41:33,376 --> 01:41:39,246
My soul was weeping continuously.

1257
01:41:39,616 --> 01:41:43,245
The stones thrown by others.

1258
01:41:43,487 --> 01:41:49,483
The stones thrown by others.

1259
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:56,294
l never even felt the pain.

1260
01:41:56,666 --> 01:42:00,466
My beloved threw flower at me.

1261
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:06,237
My beloved threw flower at me.

1262
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:13,106
My soul was weeping continuously.

1263
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:18,217
The stones thrown by others.

1264
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:24,118
l never even felt the pain.

1265
01:42:24,795 --> 01:42:29,858
My beloved threw flower at me.

1266
01:42:30,267 --> 01:42:35,227
My beloved.

1267
01:42:35,806 --> 01:42:40,209
My beloved.

1268
01:42:40,877 --> 01:42:47,077
My beloved.

1269
01:43:23,787 --> 01:43:34,527
O God, may not love bring
someone to such a situation.

1270
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:39,328
Even if he wants to forget her.

1271
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:45,137
Still the heart
refuses to forget her.

1272
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:51,341
What's this pain that l've got?

1273
01:43:51,681 --> 01:43:55,481
What's this pain that l've got?

1274
01:43:56,553 --> 01:44:02,549
Let no one get such injuries.

1275
01:44:03,159 --> 01:44:08,358
My beloved threw flower at me.

1276
01:44:34,291 --> 01:44:35,349
Okay my turn.
- Vishal, once more.

1277
01:44:35,458 --> 01:44:38,586
Vishal, once more. - No. - Vishal,
let me do it once more, please.

1278
01:44:38,662 --> 01:44:39,720
Teach me too.

1279
01:44:39,796 --> 01:44:41,787
You have taught
Babli so teach me too.

1280
01:44:42,232 --> 01:44:43,290
Teach me..

1281
01:44:44,167 --> 01:44:46,158
Mr. Vishal.
- Arun, come.

1282
01:44:51,207 --> 01:44:52,469
Sir, l've come to
take leave from you.

1283
01:44:52,676 --> 01:44:53,734
Leave?

1284
01:44:55,645 --> 01:44:56,737
To leave this city.

1285
01:44:58,615 --> 01:44:59,741
Back to stealing?

1286
01:45:00,617 --> 01:45:03,313
No sir, now l've come to my senses.

1287
01:45:04,454 --> 01:45:08,652
Now even if someone tells
me to steal it, l'll not.

1288
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,552
Now l've understood that..

1289
01:45:11,628 --> 01:45:13,687
..you can't make something
your own by stealing it.

1290
01:45:16,433 --> 01:45:18,458
Well said. What do you think Sapna?

1291
01:45:18,535 --> 01:45:19,593
Do you think that we
should let him go.

1292
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:24,097
Yes, Vishal. He has finished his
job and he must be allowed to leave.

1293
01:45:25,175 --> 01:45:26,301
You're really heartless.

1294
01:45:26,576 --> 01:45:28,373
He did so much for us and you..

1295
01:45:28,712 --> 01:45:30,111
No, Mr. Vishal l'm
used to heartlessness..

1296
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:32,205
..l have got used to it and
makes no difference to me.

1297
01:45:34,117 --> 01:45:36,779
Till someone doesn't kick us
around l don't feel that l'm living.

1298
01:45:38,521 --> 01:45:39,579
You're a crazy fellow.

1299
01:45:40,156 --> 01:45:42,181
Fine. Go and talk
to the commissioner.

1300
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:43,717
lt was he who brought you here.

1301
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,061
l will tell the
commissioner and hold him back.

1302
01:45:52,569 --> 01:45:55,197
Why?
- He has done a favour to me.

1303
01:45:56,673 --> 01:45:58,231
l want that he also
settles down in life.

1304
01:45:59,309 --> 01:46:01,072
Other wise he will
drown his life in alcohol.

1305
01:46:08,752 --> 01:46:10,083
That cassette must be here, sir.

1306
01:46:11,488 --> 01:46:13,752
There must be some
relative of Mahesh who..

1307
01:46:13,823 --> 01:46:16,383
Sir, he is a
distant relative of him.

1308
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,593
Mahesh is not to be
seen for some time.

1309
01:46:18,728 --> 01:46:20,252
His shop is also
closed for some time now.

1310
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:22,325
ls Mahesh in some sort of danger?

1311
01:46:25,468 --> 01:46:29,097
Mahesh knew some such secrets
that some people wouldn't want..

1312
01:46:29,172 --> 01:46:30,833
..that too reach me.

1313
01:46:32,575 --> 01:46:34,099
lf they can shoot me then..

1314
01:46:34,177 --> 01:46:36,577
..they can also do so on Mahesh.

1315
01:46:37,113 --> 01:46:39,741
l did a mistake by
giving birth to both of you.

1316
01:46:40,116 --> 01:46:41,174
Papa!

1317
01:46:41,618 --> 01:46:45,281
You wasted bombs and
bullets worth millions.

1318
01:46:45,455 --> 01:46:46,513
Still that scoundrel Vishal..

1319
01:46:46,589 --> 01:46:47,715
..he is still alive.

1320
01:46:47,791 --> 01:46:49,053
We showed you on the video..

1321
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:51,093
..that Vishal's car has drowned.

1322
01:46:51,227 --> 01:46:53,195
Then how did he come alive?

1323
01:46:53,463 --> 01:46:54,794
Brother, kill them.

1324
01:46:55,432 --> 01:46:57,525
By then l'll feed grapes to the
sister-in-law and come. - What?

1325
01:46:58,168 --> 01:47:02,468
Lekho.
- Okay. Okay. You go. - Okay.

1326
01:47:02,539 --> 01:47:03,597
You chew the grapes and by then..

1327
01:47:03,673 --> 01:47:05,163
..l will chew off these
scoundrels and come. - Daddy!

1328
01:47:05,241 --> 01:47:07,266
Have some grapes from me.

1329
01:47:08,278 --> 01:47:09,336
Brother-in-law.

1330
01:47:10,146 --> 01:47:12,080
Scoundrels, you're
hanging and still..

1331
01:47:12,148 --> 01:47:15,117
..you don't leave this
habit of bursting bombs.

1332
01:47:15,218 --> 01:47:16,446
Will you kill your mother too?

1333
01:47:16,553 --> 01:47:18,578
Brother, kill them. Kill them.

1334
01:47:19,155 --> 01:47:20,645
Mummy, please!
- Shut up.

1335
01:47:21,424 --> 01:47:24,450
Darling that day when the
lights went of you know what he did?

1336
01:47:24,594 --> 01:47:28,325
That was me.
- lt was you?

1337
01:47:28,398 --> 01:47:29,524
Move. Darling, you come here.

1338
01:47:29,833 --> 01:47:32,597
Sister-is-law is like the mother.
Leave the mother at least.

1339
01:47:33,136 --> 01:47:34,694
l thought that it was Rajas hands.

1340
01:47:35,205 --> 01:47:37,503
What? ls my hand like Raja's?

1341
01:47:38,108 --> 01:47:39,439
Sister-in-law, how will l know?

1342
01:47:39,509 --> 01:47:41,670
lt is ages since
l've held a woman's hand.

1343
01:47:41,778 --> 01:47:45,179
l will take you up later.
First let me decide on these two.

1344
01:47:45,315 --> 01:47:47,249
Dad, if you do like this
then you will be a big loser.

1345
01:47:47,317 --> 01:47:48,375
What loss?

1346
01:47:48,451 --> 01:47:50,248
Put us down first, fast.

1347
01:47:55,125 --> 01:47:56,786
Tell me what will be the loss?
- Free our hands.

1348
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:02,257
This is Vishal's
birthday party card.

1349
01:48:02,332 --> 01:48:03,799
Dad, listen to me first.

1350
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,096
Our arms worth millions
are stuck in the godowns.

1351
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:08,801
Which you have to send abroad.

1352
01:48:09,205 --> 01:48:11,332
That day he will be busy
in his birthday party.

1353
01:48:11,608 --> 01:48:14,475
We will bring the arms to
the dockyard and ship it off.

1354
01:48:14,677 --> 01:48:16,736
How is the idea, dad?

1355
01:48:17,514 --> 01:48:18,572
Dad!

1356
01:48:19,782 --> 01:48:21,750
Ask me why l slapped you?

1357
01:48:22,585 --> 01:48:26,248
Why? - Because why didn't you
give this sensible idea before?

1358
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:47,767
Hello. Okay.

1359
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:55,208
Sapna.
- Some work?

1360
01:48:56,586 --> 01:48:58,554
You want to leave? Never mind.

1361
01:48:58,788 --> 01:49:00,551
Let's go.
- Sure?

1362
01:49:02,258 --> 01:49:03,316
Let's go.

1363
01:49:08,364 --> 01:49:10,229
What item she is?

1364
01:49:11,067 --> 01:49:12,125
Sir, your car.

1365
01:49:14,137 --> 01:49:15,331
The pair is not perfect.

1366
01:49:18,074 --> 01:49:20,065
lf only she was in our car, then..

1367
01:49:27,483 --> 01:49:31,146
Vishal!
- He was eyeing you.

1368
01:49:31,721 --> 01:49:32,779
Hot blooded you see.

1369
01:49:37,293 --> 01:49:39,090
No sir, you can't do that, sir.

1370
01:49:39,429 --> 01:49:41,294
What am l doing?

1371
01:49:41,631 --> 01:49:42,825
Whatever will be done
will be by this dog.

1372
01:49:44,601 --> 01:49:47,297
When you die the case
will be against this dog.

1373
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:49,497
Sir, but this is illegal.

1374
01:49:50,573 --> 01:49:52,700
You know that and l know that.

1375
01:49:53,243 --> 01:49:55,040
But that poor dog doesn't know that.

1376
01:49:55,578 --> 01:49:59,105
He has never read the law books.
- But, sir.. - Poor dog.

1377
01:49:59,182 --> 01:50:00,308
But sir..

1378
01:50:00,683 --> 01:50:01,741
Why do you get worked up?

1379
01:50:03,186 --> 01:50:06,053
There is still one minute for
the alarm of this watch to go of.

1380
01:50:06,723 --> 01:50:09,453
The decision is yours.
You want to talk to me..

1381
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:11,318
..or you want to talk to that dog.

Sir, l'll tell you everything.

The owner of the casino is..
- Jimmy.

1384
01:50:20,236 --> 01:50:22,466
No, it's someone else.
- Who?

1385
01:50:22,605 --> 01:50:24,664

01:59:20,376 --> 01:59:23,573
..and l've been broken
to pieces in your love.

1507
01:59:23,646 --> 01:59:29,141
My dear, my dear. My dear.

1508
01:59:29,552 --> 01:59:35,422
My dear, my dear.

1509
02:00:45,427 --> 02:00:49,227
Arun, what happened?

1510
02:00:52,768 --> 02:00:56,295
Today Sapna told me
that she loves me.

1511
02:00:59,408 --> 02:01:00,466
l was as Vishal today.

1512
02:01:01,677 --> 02:01:03,167
Arun, stop this playing Vishal.

1513
02:01:03,545 --> 02:01:04,603
This will kill you one day.

1514
02:01:06,115 --> 02:01:07,173
Arun cannot die.

1515
02:01:09,318 --> 02:01:10,615
Sapna will not let Arun die.

1516
02:01:12,588 --> 02:01:17,457
What to do? When l
control my heart my eyes waver.

1517
02:01:18,794 --> 02:01:21,388
When l control my eyes
then my dreams waver.

1518
02:01:22,264 --> 02:01:26,633
When l break dreams then
these hands start wandering.

1519
02:01:29,471 --> 02:01:33,771
l don't know, Pooja, why
these hands wander? - Arun!

1520
02:01:39,415 --> 02:01:44,580
How do l tell her that l'm not bad?

1521
02:01:46,121 --> 02:01:48,555
lt's that l'm out of my own control.

1522
02:02:06,675 --> 02:02:08,643
Hello.
- Hello, who is that talking?

1523
02:02:09,178 --> 02:02:10,372
Who can phone you at this time?

1524
02:02:12,781 --> 02:02:15,841
Vishal, l'm very annoyed with you.
- Sapna.

1525
02:02:16,385 --> 02:02:17,443
Sapna, please dear.

1526
02:02:17,586 --> 02:02:20,783
Look, l want to meet you, Now.

1527
02:02:21,357 --> 02:02:25,589
That's why l phoned you.
l'm outside my house. - What?

1528
02:02:25,661 --> 02:02:26,719
Come on.

1529
02:02:33,869 --> 02:02:36,736
Vishal, l'm upset with you.

1530
02:02:37,239 --> 02:02:40,504
At least you could. - Come on,
please. Please. Please not today.

1531
02:02:40,609 --> 02:02:44,477
l have to talk something to you.

1532
02:02:44,847 --> 02:02:47,213
Not today, l've
surprise for you, come.

1533
02:02:47,583 --> 02:02:53,385
Come.
- Vishal, l'm sorry.

1534
02:02:53,455 --> 02:02:55,286
Happy birthday.

1535
02:02:56,825 --> 02:02:59,089
Not like this. From
today on all my birthdays..

1536
02:02:59,161 --> 02:03:03,564
..you'll blow the candles and
the cake will be cut by both of us.

1537
02:03:05,267 --> 02:03:07,599
l don't about the others
but at least in this life.

1538
02:03:07,669 --> 02:03:08,727
Come on.

1539
02:03:10,272 --> 02:03:11,330
Come on.

1540
02:03:12,541 --> 02:03:13,599
Come on.

1541
02:03:20,582 --> 02:03:23,210
Happy birthday to me.

1542
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:28,289
What's this?
- TV dad. What picture.

1543
02:03:28,357 --> 02:03:30,621
This is Vishal's birthday
party of today's evening.

1544
02:03:32,227 --> 02:03:34,695
Rana. Put the other cassette.

1545
02:03:41,336 --> 02:03:44,737
This is also Vishal who has blown
up all our arms and ammunitions.

1546
02:03:45,207 --> 02:03:47,732
How can one man be in two places?

1547
02:03:48,177 --> 02:03:50,668
Dad that is not Vishal
but his ghost. - Shut up.

1548
02:03:52,614 --> 02:03:56,243
lt seems that Vishal has
got a look alike for him.

1549
02:03:57,252 --> 02:03:59,743
That means that we've to
kill not one but two Vishals.

1550
02:04:01,256 --> 02:04:03,690
Here one doesn't die and now two!

1551
02:04:04,093 --> 02:04:05,151
No problem.

1552
02:04:05,661 --> 02:04:07,652
We will blow both
of them with a bomb.

1553
02:04:08,797 --> 02:04:11,357
We will blow them
when they are together.

1554
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:15,201
So that when the real Vishal
dies he dies in front of our eyes.

1555
02:04:16,371 --> 02:04:20,569
Darling. - What? - lf the violence
is over then can we start romance?

1556
02:04:20,776 --> 02:04:21,834
No.

1557
02:04:22,611 --> 02:04:25,102
l take a vow that
till l've finished..

1558
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:28,343
..these two, l'll not
indulge in romance. Go away.

1559
02:04:33,388 --> 02:04:36,118
The monger has come
again at the doorstep..

1560
02:04:36,191 --> 02:04:39,854
..with the question,
who does she love?

1561
02:04:41,663 --> 02:04:45,326
We used to read these on truck tops
and now it is printed on my heart.

1562
02:04:46,335 --> 02:04:48,394
Tell me Pooja, who does Pooja love?

1563
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:49,528
You.

1564
02:04:50,139 --> 02:04:51,367
But l'm the shadow
and not the original.

1565
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:53,674
You're Arun. Sapna's Arun.

1566
02:04:54,276 --> 02:04:56,073
Why does she utter
only Vishal's name?

1567
02:04:56,678 --> 02:04:58,805
The girls always hide
their love from the world.

1568
02:04:59,448 --> 02:05:01,279
Then why is that l'm able
to have faith in her love?

1569
02:05:02,184 --> 02:05:04,084
lf she doesn't love you then would..

1570
02:05:04,153 --> 02:05:09,557
..she have danced to your
beat on the birthday party?

1571
02:05:11,293 --> 02:05:12,453
Would she have danced like that?

1572
02:05:14,830 --> 02:05:18,823
Arun, you're in
every breath of Sapna.

1573
02:05:21,236 --> 02:05:23,170
You understand the hearts so well.

1574
02:05:25,174 --> 02:05:27,108
You must've also fallen in
love with some on sometime.

1575
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:43,620
What's the matter?
Have to go somewhere?

1576
02:05:43,692 --> 02:05:44,750
No.

1577
02:05:46,128 --> 02:05:47,186
Will you have something to eat?

1578
02:05:48,463 --> 02:05:49,521
No, later.

1579
02:05:53,735 --> 02:05:58,297
Vishal there is a burden on my mind.

1580
02:05:59,107 --> 02:06:00,165
Burden?

1581
02:06:00,475 --> 02:06:01,533
Vishal..

1582
02:06:02,678 --> 02:06:09,311
We know each other from childhood.
There are no secrets between us.

1583
02:06:10,552 --> 02:06:15,421
So.
- l want to tell you something.

1584
02:06:17,392 --> 02:06:22,193
When you were in coma, l and
Arun got trapped in an island.

1585
02:06:24,099 --> 02:06:26,499
For two days and two nights.

1586
02:06:29,171 --> 02:06:31,366
No, he kept his distance.

1587
02:06:33,141 --> 02:06:37,237
Before that also he had
taken me to many such places.

1588
02:06:40,115 --> 02:06:41,343
Where l had never been.

1589
02:06:43,585 --> 02:06:47,749
There was this strange warmth in
his eyes. ln the way he spoke.

1590
02:06:49,725 --> 02:06:52,125
He never even touched me.

1591
02:06:52,461 --> 02:06:53,553
He was such a gentleman.

1592
02:06:55,097 --> 02:06:57,463
But. But, Vishal..

1593
02:06:58,467 --> 02:07:06,203
But? - He has touched
some corner of my heart.

1594
02:07:09,645 --> 02:07:11,078
What it was l don't know.

1595
02:07:14,149 --> 02:07:17,641
l was flowing away.

1596
02:07:22,291 --> 02:07:25,385
Do you also love him?

1597
02:07:34,102 --> 02:07:35,160
Maybe.

1598
02:07:37,639 --> 02:07:38,697
l don't know.

1599
02:07:41,276 --> 02:07:45,178
But Vishal, l'm yours
and will be yours forever.

1600
02:07:48,050 --> 02:07:50,314
Should there not be so
much truth between us.

1601
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:55,086
That even if l've seen
someone l must be able to tell you.

1602
02:07:57,426 --> 02:07:59,053
Maybe l mistook him for you.

1603
02:08:01,063 --> 02:08:03,122
But still l had spent some
time with him, isn't it?

1604
02:08:09,504 --> 02:08:10,664
Sapna, l..

1605
02:08:15,410 --> 02:08:16,468
l'll be back soon.

1606
02:08:17,412 --> 02:08:19,710
Vishal, you can't
leave me like this.

1607
02:08:21,083 --> 02:08:22,141
l'll be back soon.

1608
02:08:22,217 --> 02:08:23,275
Vi..

1609
02:08:34,162 --> 02:08:40,328
Arun. Did she come to know?

1610
02:08:41,837 --> 02:08:43,600
No.
- Thanks.

1611
02:08:46,575 --> 02:08:47,633
Not her.

1612
02:08:55,150 --> 02:08:57,175
lt's so long and you
didn't order anything?

1613
02:09:00,622 --> 02:09:03,113
Vishal, it has no effect on you?

1614
02:09:04,092 --> 02:09:05,389
l said something so important.

1615
02:09:06,461 --> 02:09:11,262
There was an effect. But
you repeat it once more.

1616
02:09:11,666 --> 02:09:12,792
This time l'll
listen to you seriously.

1617
02:09:13,468 --> 02:09:16,631
No, Vishal. lt is difficult for a
girl to repeat something like that.

1618
02:09:16,705 --> 02:09:20,573
l understand but for my sake
say it again. Come on doll.

1619
02:09:23,345 --> 02:09:29,580
Vishal, you did it again.
You can't do this to me.

1620
02:09:29,651 --> 02:09:32,085
Oh shit. l'm caught.

1621
02:09:32,754 --> 02:09:35,086
l was getting late and l met Arun.

1622
02:09:35,490 --> 02:09:36,582
l wanted to escape from your anger.

1623
02:09:37,092 --> 02:09:40,152
Come on Sapna, it
won't happen again.

1624
02:09:47,202 --> 02:09:49,670
What's the matter? You
look very happy today.

1625
02:09:54,376 --> 02:09:57,504
Laughing too? What's the matter?

1626
02:10:02,784 --> 02:10:07,118
Understood, Sapna must've
told you that she loves you.

1627
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:17,391
Yes, maybe and l don't know.

1628
02:10:18,266 --> 02:10:21,599
Hey brother, l didn't understand.

1629
02:10:33,081 --> 02:10:34,139
Hello.

1630
02:10:34,749 --> 02:10:36,580
Are you telling me or
are you playing the fool.

1631
02:10:43,558 --> 02:10:44,820
Spectacle.

1632
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,498
What happened?

1633
02:11:03,044 --> 02:11:04,705
This love is something strange.

1634
02:11:05,247 --> 02:11:07,306
They get into their world.

1635
02:11:12,454 --> 02:11:14,183
Should l pick you up?
- No, l'll come on my own.

1636
02:11:15,257 --> 02:11:16,519
Sure?
- Sure.

1637
02:11:16,725 --> 02:11:17,783
Okay.
- Bye.

1638
02:11:30,705 --> 02:11:31,763
Sapna.

1639
02:11:35,477 --> 02:11:36,535
Sapna.

1640
02:11:37,579 --> 02:11:38,637
Sapna.

1641
02:11:39,781 --> 02:11:44,081
Some one has touched
the corner of your heart.

1642
02:11:48,390 --> 02:11:49,448
What're you doing here?

1643
02:11:50,091 --> 02:11:55,324
Just looking. l wish
that l die looking at you.

1644
02:11:56,164 --> 02:11:57,324
Why are you doing this to me?

1645
02:12:00,402 --> 02:12:01,699
Go away from this city, please.

1646
02:12:03,838 --> 02:12:05,305
Will that give you peace?
- lt will.

1647
02:12:07,175 --> 02:12:10,110
Strange. You ask me to go away.

1648
02:12:11,379 --> 02:12:12,710
Mr. Vishal is not
permitting me to go away.

1649
02:12:14,249 --> 02:12:15,307
What should l do?

1650
02:12:15,584 --> 02:12:17,108
Do as you wish.

1651
02:12:22,524 --> 02:12:26,324
l wish that this
lift stays here forever.

1652
02:12:27,462 --> 02:12:29,191
No one other than me sees this face.

1653
02:12:30,799 --> 02:12:33,529
l spend the entire
life on these eyes.

1654
02:12:35,303 --> 02:12:36,361
Don't do this to me.

1655
02:12:37,472 --> 02:12:38,530
Let the lift keep moving, please.

1656
02:13:28,123 --> 02:13:29,488
lt is late and Arun must've come.

1657
02:13:29,557 --> 02:13:31,821
Vishal, you.. why did you call Arun?

1658
02:13:32,127 --> 02:13:33,185
Can't we be alone for sometime? -

1659
02:13:33,528 --> 02:13:35,758
Come on Sapna,
we're obligated to him.

1660
02:13:36,197 --> 02:13:37,255
Here he comes.

1661
02:13:37,399 --> 02:13:38,457
Set right your mood.

1662
02:13:40,335 --> 02:13:42,132
Hi Arun, how are you?

1663
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:47,699
'There must be some
effect of the pains of love.'

1664
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:52,079
'lt may be less but
it will be there.'

1665
02:13:52,747 --> 02:13:54,806
l called you for drinks and
you seem to be already drunk.

1666
02:13:57,085 --> 02:14:00,384
This is not the effect of
liquor but of something else.

1667
02:14:03,191 --> 02:14:04,818
You're in love and l know with whom.

1668
02:14:06,394 --> 02:14:08,555
Do you know, then say who it is?

1669
02:14:08,663 --> 02:14:12,463
We policemen have sharp eyes and
nothing is hidden from us. Sit down.

1670
02:14:15,470 --> 02:14:16,528
Shall l tell the name, Sapna?

1671
02:14:17,172 --> 02:14:18,230
How will l know?

1672
02:14:20,642 --> 02:14:24,339
Her name is Pooja,
she stays with him.

1673
02:14:24,612 --> 02:14:25,840
Did l guess it correctly?

1674
02:14:28,116 --> 02:14:30,550
Yes.
- Does she also love you?

1675
02:14:31,186 --> 02:14:32,244
l hope it is not one sided.

1676
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:33,378
ls it like ours?

1677
02:14:35,223 --> 02:14:39,182
She is in love with me
but refuses to admit it.

1678
02:14:40,395 --> 02:14:41,453
Sapna, what type of a girl is she?

1679
02:14:42,397 --> 02:14:44,388
There is one such girl.

1680
02:14:45,767 --> 02:14:47,632
Okay, come on. Lets'
have a drink. Waiter.

1681
02:14:48,703 --> 02:14:53,265
No sir. l've lived enough as
Vishal. You try drinking like Arun.

1682
02:14:54,409 --> 02:14:55,467
Done.

1683
02:15:31,112 --> 02:15:33,171
What rhythm is there in your beat?

1684
02:15:33,815 --> 02:15:36,443
Maybe that is not so in your love.

1685
02:15:37,185 --> 02:15:38,243
Probably that's why..

1686
02:15:52,333 --> 02:15:55,302
How much someone loves someone?

1687
02:15:55,637 --> 02:15:58,401
Who love how much.

1688
02:15:58,740 --> 02:16:02,198
No one knows that here.

1689
02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:05,279
Crazy.

1690
02:16:06,514 --> 02:16:12,077
l'm the one crazy for love.

1691
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:22,091
Crazy. l'm the one crazy for love.

1692
02:16:22,564 --> 02:16:32,701
l can't bear it. Without
love the heart can't bear it.

1693
02:17:07,108 --> 02:17:10,271
What is this
destination and what route.

1694
02:17:10,745 --> 02:17:13,509
There is some image in the eyes
and some other name on the lips.

1695
02:17:21,222 --> 02:17:27,161
What's in this world?
Only conceit and conceit.

1696
02:17:27,795 --> 02:17:34,291
lt is only you that
l've my faith on.

1697
02:17:34,669 --> 02:17:41,404
The shadow of my hair
and the warmth of my arms.

1698
02:17:41,476 --> 02:17:47,437
My faithfulness is all for you.

1699
02:17:47,515 --> 02:17:53,545
The flame is really crazy
and will never understand.

1700
02:17:54,122 --> 02:17:57,421
Why the fireflies burn in her.

1701
02:17:57,525 --> 02:18:00,790
Crazy.

1702
02:18:01,562 --> 02:18:07,398
l'm the one crazy for love.

1703
02:18:07,635 --> 02:18:17,704
l can't bear it. Without
love the heart can't bear it.

1704
02:18:48,276 --> 02:18:51,712
She never even
noticed my palm too.

1705
02:18:52,647 --> 02:18:56,310
ln that there is a line
that resembles her too.

1706
02:18:59,387 --> 02:19:05,257
The season has come for
the romance of the hearts.

1707
02:19:06,227 --> 02:19:12,291
Do not ask the extent to
which craziness can extend.

1708
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:19,603
l'm not in my senses nor
do l know the whereabouts.

1709
02:19:19,674 --> 02:19:25,806
This is all the effect of love.

1710
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:32,144
The cold winds have
come in this season too.

1711
02:19:32,286 --> 02:19:35,619
To burn out and torture me.

1712
02:19:35,823 --> 02:19:39,088
Crazy.

1713
02:19:40,161 --> 02:19:45,258
l'm the one crazy for love.

1714
02:19:45,767 --> 02:19:55,608
l can't bear it. Without
love the heart can't bear it.

1715
02:20:00,615 --> 02:20:05,052
Arun, you were right. This place
is very romantic and beautiful.

1716
02:20:06,187 --> 02:20:11,420
Yes, sir. lf someone comes to this
place then it's remembered life long.

1717
02:20:16,164 --> 02:20:18,155
Sir, you were asking
me who l'm in love with.

1718
02:20:19,167 --> 02:20:20,327
Today l'll tell you that.

1719
02:20:24,205 --> 02:20:25,263
With Sapna.

1720
02:20:30,211 --> 02:20:31,269
We have played a lot of games and..

1721
02:20:31,345 --> 02:20:34,508
..l don't want to keep
you in the dark anymore.

1722
02:20:36,617 --> 02:20:37,777
l love Sapna.

1723
02:20:38,519 --> 02:20:39,577
Sapna loves me.

1724
02:20:43,825 --> 02:20:49,024
No.
- Sapna. - No Vishal, l..

1725
02:20:50,131 --> 02:20:52,599
Tell the truth today Sapna,
how long will you hide it?

1726
02:20:54,168 --> 02:20:57,137
lf this is the truth
then l'll shoot myself.

1727
02:20:58,239 --> 02:20:59,365
lf this is a lie then..

1728
02:21:00,308 --> 02:21:03,243
No, this can't be true.

1729
02:21:03,711 --> 02:21:09,149
Sapna.
- No l don't love Arun.

1730
02:21:18,126 --> 02:21:19,388
Arun, you're right.

1731
02:21:19,594 --> 02:21:23,121
lt's amazing. This
place is too good.

1732
02:21:23,731 --> 02:21:25,460
Cheers.
- Cheers, sir.

1733
02:21:37,645 --> 02:21:38,703
Fire.

1734
02:21:55,630 --> 02:21:57,222
You move out with
Sapna and l'll stop them.

1735
02:21:57,298 --> 02:21:58,356
No Vishal..

1736
02:22:00,301 --> 02:22:02,769
But, sir.
- An order is an order.

1737
02:22:03,104 --> 02:22:04,162
Vishal.

1738
02:22:04,305 --> 02:22:05,363
Yes, sir.

1739
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:11,341
l will cover from the top
and you move out with Sapna.

1740
02:22:11,479 --> 02:22:12,537
Vishal!

1741
02:22:33,301 --> 02:22:34,359
Arun.

1742
02:22:38,873 --> 02:22:40,397
They've gone there. Chase them.

1743
02:24:01,222 --> 02:24:02,280
Look there.

1744
02:24:16,771 --> 02:24:17,829
Look there.

1745
02:24:46,233 --> 02:24:47,291
Come out.

1746
02:24:55,142 --> 02:25:00,808
Jimmy your enmity is
with me. Shoot me.

1747
02:25:03,484 --> 02:25:04,542
Sir.

1748
02:25:05,553 --> 02:25:06,611
Okay.

1749
02:25:06,687 --> 02:25:07,745
First you die.

1750
02:25:08,656 --> 02:25:09,714
Then your look alike will die.

1751
02:25:11,158 --> 02:25:12,420
Shoot. Shoot.
- Stop.

1752
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:14,752
Shoot.
- l told you to stop. Come on.

1753
02:25:23,104 --> 02:25:24,162
Mr. Vishal.

1754
02:25:24,839 --> 02:25:28,172
What's this you did? For the sake
of my life you endangered your life.

1755
02:25:28,242 --> 02:25:30,472
Come on. You took care of my life.

1756
02:25:30,745 --> 02:25:33,373
Will l not take care of
your life? Come on let's go.

1757
02:25:42,289 --> 02:25:46,316
Take this and apply. This is
enough. l'll stop all this now.

1758
02:25:46,394 --> 02:25:47,452
Mama, listen..

1759
02:25:47,528 --> 02:25:48,586
No more mama.

1760
02:25:48,662 --> 02:25:50,289
l'm taking the priest
and going to Sapna's house.

1761
02:25:51,132 --> 02:25:52,463
Mama, this is not
the time for marriage.

1762
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:53,792
l don't want to hear anything.

1763
02:25:54,235 --> 02:25:55,793
Now it will be direct
marriage and no engagement.

1764
02:25:56,137 --> 02:25:58,401
Anyway your marriage was due
before the accident took place.

1765
02:25:58,706 --> 02:26:00,105
Arun, you explain it to mummy.

1766
02:26:00,174 --> 02:26:01,334
What will Arun explain to me?

1767
02:26:01,475 --> 02:26:03,375
l'm taking Arun with
me to Sapna's house.

1768
02:26:03,444 --> 02:26:05,241
Arun, come with me. Let's go.
- Yes.

1769
02:26:10,284 --> 02:26:11,410
Relax, brother. Relax.

1770
02:26:11,819 --> 02:26:14,219
Now the date is fixed for 6th.
- lt's an auspicious day too.

1771
02:26:14,455 --> 02:26:17,356
Let us tie both of them in
the nuptial knot. - Yes. Yes.

1772
02:26:17,558 --> 02:26:18,616
We have waited enough.

1773
02:26:18,692 --> 02:26:21,160
By the way, at least for
Sapna he will reform himself.

1774
02:26:21,228 --> 02:26:22,490
You're right.

1775
02:26:23,097 --> 02:26:24,155
Even l wish the same.

1776
02:26:45,386 --> 02:26:47,581
Are you thinking about Arun?
- What?

1777
02:26:49,089 --> 02:26:51,421
The one you love his
thought always comes.

1778
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:54,789
Sister, l'm the only one..

1779
02:26:55,329 --> 02:26:57,194
..who knows all about
your heart and mind.

1780
02:26:58,466 --> 02:27:00,058
Sister, you're
actually in love with Arun.

1781
02:27:00,601 --> 02:27:03,331
Don't spoil three lives
by this marriage, please.

1782
02:27:12,413 --> 02:27:14,313
Your heart has already
answered this question for you.

1783
02:27:15,816 --> 02:27:19,513
lf you don't listen to that then
the heart is not to be blamed.

1784
02:27:21,155 --> 02:27:22,713
Vishal had brought
love to your life.

1785
02:27:23,357 --> 02:27:26,417
But it was Arun who
aroused love in you.

1786
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:42,609
You! You're Sapna isn't it?

1787
02:27:44,245 --> 02:27:48,045
Yes, how did you recognise me?

1788
02:27:52,186 --> 02:27:53,744
l have seen you in Arun's eyes.

1789
02:27:57,491 --> 02:28:04,454
You?
- l'm nothing to Arun.

1790
02:28:05,699 --> 02:28:08,429
Come. He is waiting for
you for a long time. Come.

1791
02:28:11,438 --> 02:28:12,496
Arun.

1792
02:28:14,074 --> 02:28:15,132
Arun.

1793
02:28:25,519 --> 02:28:26,577
Surprised?

1794
02:28:28,556 --> 02:28:32,458
lf not Arun l had the
faith that you'd come.

1795
02:28:52,146 --> 02:28:53,204
What's it that you want?

1796
02:28:55,049 --> 02:28:56,107
What's it that you want?

1797
02:28:57,785 --> 02:28:59,616
That l admit that
l'm in love with you?

1798
02:29:00,154 --> 02:29:01,212
Yes, l'm in love with you.

1799
02:29:01,622 --> 02:29:03,647
Are you happy now?

1800
02:29:06,627 --> 02:29:11,496
Why did you come into my
life with a lot of love?

1801
02:29:14,134 --> 02:29:19,504
l'm confused now. Tell me,
what should l do now?

1802
02:29:22,509 --> 02:29:29,506
My life l surrender to you now.

1803
02:29:37,524 --> 02:29:41,221
First it was me who
wavered and now it is you.

1804
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:48,031
But you're not to
be blamed for that.

1805
02:29:50,437 --> 02:29:52,496
lt is my determination.
My craziness.

1806
02:29:53,774 --> 02:29:55,435
That was forcing you to waver.

1807
02:30:00,047 --> 02:30:03,039
l'm a very selfish and fallen man.

1808
02:30:06,387 --> 02:30:08,480
No one can have a
larger heart than Vishal.

1809
02:30:10,090 --> 02:30:13,218
He thinks someone's life
more precious than his.

1810
02:30:17,798 --> 02:30:19,129
l have seen it in Vishal's eyes.

1811
02:30:20,401 --> 02:30:23,336
That how much he loves you.

1812
02:30:29,076 --> 02:30:32,068
And l was trying to
steal you from him.

1813
02:30:33,447 --> 02:30:34,505
Go away, Sapna.

1814
02:30:35,082 --> 02:30:36,140
Go away.

1815
02:31:09,049 --> 02:31:13,611
How lucky you're that
you can stay near him.

1816
02:31:17,558 --> 02:31:18,616
Take care of him.

1817
02:31:31,739 --> 02:31:33,570
Arun, what's this you did?

1818
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:43,377
l learned
sacrificing in love from you.

1819
02:31:51,158 --> 02:31:54,650
We'll go back. This
city is not for us.

1820
02:32:00,501 --> 02:32:03,470
At last Arun has come to
know that you love him.

1821
02:32:04,104 --> 02:32:06,664
The curtain of his love for
Sapna was hiding his vision.

1822
02:32:08,575 --> 02:32:10,270
Arun has accepted your love for him.

1823
02:32:10,811 --> 02:32:13,109
Otherwise why tell you
that we'll leave this city?

1824
02:32:20,187 --> 02:32:22,178
You've got your love, Pooja.

1825
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:29,122
l've seen a lot of crazy
people but not such craziness.

1826
02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:31,254
You laugh and still these tears.

1827
02:32:33,267 --> 02:32:35,599
l'm laughing because l'm very happy.

1828
02:32:37,538 --> 02:32:40,302
What l wanted l've got.

1829
02:32:42,476 --> 02:32:43,568
l'm crying for him.

1830
02:32:45,212 --> 02:32:49,740
He will carry Sapna's
memories throughout life and weep.

1831
02:32:52,252 --> 02:32:53,310
Prakash.

1832
02:32:55,289 --> 02:32:56,347
Prakash.

1833
02:32:57,724 --> 02:32:59,783
This help from you..
- Yes, Mahesh.

1834
02:33:01,461 --> 02:33:06,160
This cassette.. police..

1835
02:33:07,467 --> 02:33:10,163
Cassette..

1836
02:33:12,105 --> 02:33:13,163
Police.

1837
02:33:18,312 --> 02:33:20,280
Cassette? Police?

1838
02:33:23,550 --> 02:33:25,643
Hello.
- Mr. Lekhraj - Speaking.

1839
02:33:26,386 --> 02:33:30,550
Sir, it is fantastic
that l've found you at last.

1840
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:31,682
Who's that speaking?

1841
02:33:32,326 --> 02:33:35,352
Sir, l have one of
your video cassette.

1842
02:33:37,164 --> 02:33:38,597
What a scene there is
of you in that, great!

1843
02:33:39,466 --> 02:33:42,526
Actually you're murdering
someone in that cassette.

1844
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:45,695
lf that video cassette
reaches the police..

1845
02:33:46,073 --> 02:33:47,131
..then..

1846
02:33:48,408 --> 02:33:50,603
Tell me the price.
- 10 million rupees.

1847
02:33:50,811 --> 02:33:52,244
Agreed, where do l meet you?

1848
02:33:52,646 --> 02:33:54,477
Sunset point, 1 1 O' clock.

1849
02:33:55,549 --> 02:33:56,607
Will meet you.

1850
02:33:58,085 --> 02:34:00,451
Stop where are you running?
Give me that cassette.

1851
02:34:06,159 --> 02:34:07,421
Have you understood what l said?

1852
02:34:08,095 --> 02:34:09,756
What's this? Who is this?
Who is this?

1853
02:34:10,330 --> 02:34:12,594
Sir, cassette.

1854
02:34:17,838 --> 02:34:22,298
Nandu will you unmask me?
Before the police? Before Vishal?

1855
02:34:22,743 --> 02:34:24,267
Bullets have become very expensive.

1856
02:34:24,611 --> 02:34:27,842
Give me a knife.
- No. - Unmask me before Vishal?

1857
02:34:34,521 --> 02:34:35,818
Let's crack down on these guys.

1858
02:34:36,390 --> 02:34:39,120
Sir, Vishal.
- No, don't tell him anything.

1859
02:34:39,693 --> 02:34:42,389
Otherwise he'll leave
everything and go after them.

1860
02:34:42,562 --> 02:34:43,859
After all it is his marriage today.

1861
02:34:44,164 --> 02:34:46,064
That's it. That's it.
That's it. Leave it here.

1862
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,061
You came here without the sweets?

1863
02:34:48,368 --> 02:34:50,768
l've brought the sweets and
kept them. Are you alright.

1864
02:34:53,073 --> 02:34:56,133
What's wrong with me?
Hang the flowers, move.

1865
02:34:57,411 --> 02:35:01,142
Pull this upwards,
From that side too.

1866
02:35:12,259 --> 02:35:13,658
Have the things
for the rituals come?

1867
02:35:13,794 --> 02:35:16,228
That the priest will bring.
What about the garland?

1868
02:35:16,630 --> 02:35:17,722
l forgot. l'll bring it just now.

1869
02:35:29,176 --> 02:35:31,701
Pooja, why are you here.
Dress up the bride.

1870
02:35:32,112 --> 02:35:34,103
She should the best
in her life today.

1871
02:35:34,281 --> 02:35:37,717
Arun, l understand your pain.

1872
02:35:38,118 --> 02:35:39,176
Pooja, come.

1873
02:35:51,064 --> 02:35:53,624
Will you keep chatting or
will you get it started?

1874
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:55,759
Priest, start the rituals.

1875
02:35:56,069 --> 02:35:58,060
The auspicious time is passing away.

1876
02:36:04,411 --> 02:36:07,608
Babli.
- Yes, brother. - Take this to mama.

1877
02:36:19,493 --> 02:36:20,824
But dad..
- Where is uncle?

1878
02:36:21,261 --> 02:36:23,491
He has gone looking for an
aunt in the party. Really?

1879
02:36:26,166 --> 02:36:28,691
Arun, call Vishal.
- Yes.

1880
02:36:31,037 --> 02:36:32,299
What's it?

1881
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:36,300
The police have got your cassette.
- What are you saying? Come.

1882
02:36:36,776 --> 02:36:40,041
Arun, there is some work.
Excuse us please.

1883
02:36:41,781 --> 02:36:43,715
Let's run away, dad.

1884
02:36:44,184 --> 02:36:45,981
The police have
cordoned of the place.

1885
02:36:48,855 --> 02:36:50,914
lf we have to die then
we shall kill and die.

1886
02:36:51,758 --> 02:36:57,060
Dad, he is unarmed. Let
us destroy his marriage.

1887
02:36:58,798 --> 02:36:59,856
Come on, hurry up.

1888
02:37:05,005 --> 02:37:07,064
Hello, Vishal.
- Yes, sir.

1889
02:37:11,111 --> 02:37:12,169
Vishal, lt is your uncle..

1890
02:37:12,245 --> 02:37:14,110
..who has caused all the
violence in the city. Go.

1891
02:37:29,329 --> 02:37:30,853
Vishal, your life is in danger.

1892
02:37:40,106 --> 02:37:42,438
They have reached your marriage
venue now. - Don't worry, sir.

1893
02:37:43,810 --> 02:37:44,868
Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

1894
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:54,778
No!

1895
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:01,418
Arun!

1896
02:38:12,005 --> 02:38:13,905
Rane! Give me the gun. Rane!

1897
02:38:48,375 --> 02:38:50,775
Vishal, leave him.
No, Vishal. No, Vishal.

1898
02:39:25,679 --> 02:39:27,874
Arun, what're you thinking?

1899
02:39:31,084 --> 02:39:32,881
Till now l controlled my emotions.

1900
02:39:34,154 --> 02:39:38,682
Now l'm scared that my
one mistake will spoil..

1901
02:39:38,758 --> 02:39:41,283
..the life of Sapna and Vishal.

1902
02:39:42,095 --> 02:39:43,824
But Vishal is coming
here to pick you up.

1903
02:39:44,898 --> 02:39:45,956
Let's go.

1904
02:39:51,071 --> 02:39:52,129
Arun.

1905
02:39:52,238 --> 02:39:53,296
Arun!

1906
02:39:56,042 --> 02:39:57,100
Arun, stop.

1907
02:39:58,211 --> 02:39:59,701
Driver, stop the car.

1908
02:40:11,891 --> 02:40:14,792
What do you think that you will load
your favours on me and run away?

1909
02:40:16,229 --> 02:40:18,720
l just want to go back now.

1910
02:40:19,265 --> 02:40:20,823
Then this marriage can't
take place without you.

1911
02:40:21,201 --> 02:40:23,396
Mr. Vishal, don't force me.

1912
02:40:23,803 --> 02:40:25,327
How can the marriage take
place without the groom?

1913
02:40:32,212 --> 02:40:33,270
Vishal!

1914
02:40:34,247 --> 02:40:36,215
Are you both not ashamed? Crazy?

1915
02:40:36,783 --> 02:40:38,216
You wanted to hide
your feelings from me?

1916
02:40:39,853 --> 02:40:41,684
The monger has come
again at the doorstep..

1917
02:40:41,755 --> 02:40:44,019
..with the question,
who does she love?

1918
02:40:45,358 --> 02:40:47,292
This verse. - We used to
read these on truck tops.

1919
02:40:48,261 --> 02:40:49,319
And now it is printed on my heart.

1920
02:40:50,964 --> 02:40:53,023
Tell me Pooja, who does Pooja love?

1921
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,160
That means that it
was you on that day?

1922
02:40:58,104 --> 02:41:01,130
lf he can become Vishal
then can't l become Arun?

1923
02:41:02,776 --> 02:41:03,834
When my suspicion was confirmed..

1924
02:41:03,910 --> 02:41:05,070
..l gave both of a lot
of chances to meet.

1925
02:41:05,745 --> 02:41:08,213
But you both had the
program to sacrifice.

1926
02:41:08,882 --> 02:41:11,715
Mr. Vishal l have
no right over Sapna.

1927
02:41:11,818 --> 02:41:13,843
Chuck it, buddy, talking of rights.

1928
02:41:14,154 --> 02:41:16,179
Two days back l had told
every one else except Sapna.

1929
02:41:16,723 --> 02:41:18,714
That l'll make you the groom
suddenly at the right moment.

1930
02:41:18,992 --> 02:41:20,926
You spoiled my surprise.

1931
02:41:25,298 --> 02:41:26,356
Vishal!

1932
02:41:28,268 --> 02:41:31,726
Doll, l always
thought you as the doll.

1933
02:41:32,305 --> 02:41:37,140
l forgot that the doll too has her
own heart and dreams and emotions.

1934
02:41:38,411 --> 02:41:41,869
He who can peep into the heart
of a woman and read her dreams..

1935
02:41:42,916 --> 02:41:44,144
..he has the real
right over that woman.

1936
02:41:44,918 --> 02:41:45,976
And you're that Arun.

1937
02:41:51,691 --> 02:41:52,749
Pooja!

1938
02:41:54,427 --> 02:41:57,419
Don't stop me. Let me go.

1939
02:41:57,897 --> 02:42:01,264
But you..
- Sapna will have her won luck.

1940
02:42:03,236 --> 02:42:04,294
And Pooja will have her own path.

1941
02:42:07,974 --> 02:42:09,999
Sapna, take care of Arun.

1942
02:42:12,745 --> 02:42:14,713
Mr, Vishal, shall l
tell you something?

1943
02:42:15,949 --> 02:42:17,007
One day we'll get
together and make..

1944
02:42:17,083 --> 02:42:19,278
..an association of
people with broken hearts.

1945
02:42:20,453 --> 02:42:22,045
l tell you that half
the world will be there.

1946
02:42:43,409 --> 02:42:46,310
She's gone and l'm also going.
l've been transferred.

1947
02:42:49,849 --> 02:42:53,683
Arun, l've heard the story about..

1948
02:42:53,753 --> 02:42:56,085
..the king who had a queen.

1949
02:42:57,156 --> 02:42:58,316
There is a crazy woman
for every crazy man.

1950
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:02,018
That is the story these days.

1951
02:43:02,862 --> 02:43:03,920
All the best.

1952
02:43:04,030 --> 02:43:07,022
How much someone loves someone?

1953
02:43:07,367 --> 02:43:13,897
Who loves how much.
No one knows that here.

1954
02:43:14,007 --> 02:43:17,067
Crazy.

1955
02:43:18,211 --> 02:43:23,774
l'm the one crazy for love.

1956
02:43:23,983 --> 02:43:34,188
The heart doesn't
agree without love.

1957
02:43:34,327 --> 02:43:44,066
Crazy. l'm the one crazy for love.

1958
02:43:44,370 --> 02:43:54,405
Crazy. l'm the one crazy for love.

1959
02:43:54,681 --> 02:44:04,750
The heart doesn't
agree without love.
