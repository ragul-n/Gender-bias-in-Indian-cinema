1
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:44,140
For you, the sun is radiant
in the mornings.

2
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:53,149
For you, the night brings
forth dreams.

3
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,023
Your absence, even for
a moment, said to me..

4
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:08,097
..you're my wealth..
because of you..

5
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:16,005
..my heart is joyous!

6
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:23,012
My heart is joyous!

7
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:57,053
My life would've
been incomplete.

8
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,218
When I found you..

9
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,087
..it became complete.

10
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:11,229
I was a tunnel of sorrow..

11
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:19,075
..when you touched
me, I glowed.

12
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:23,080
In untold brilliance, from
unexpected quarters..

13
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:27,075
..the heavens have descended.

14
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:33,149
My heart is joyous!

15
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:41,022
My heart is joyous!

16
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:12,027
In this body..

17
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,227
..what is this restlessness..

18
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,102
..that my steps..

19
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:23,039
..have started moving
on their own.

20
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,272
In this new city..

21
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,207
..why, without a thought..

22
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,117
..on a new path..

23
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:38,055
..I've begun to tread.

24
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,060
I'm in your heart, like
pearl in an oyster.

25
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,121
I'm an ocean of love.

26
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:53,162
The heart is joyous!

27
00:07:54,273 --> 00:08:02,078
The heart is joyous!

28
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,144
Rs.200, sir.

29
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,094
Good morning, sir.
May I help you?

30
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,063
Hi, my name is Ranjan Verma.

31
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,125
There must be a room booked
on my name. -Yes, sir.

32
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,074
Thank you, your room
key. -Excuse me.

33
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,144
Yes? -Mr. Ranjan Verma?

34
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,172
I'm Christine. This is for you.

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,113
Your car key. The car
is parked outside.

36
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,122
Ok. -Thank you. -Yeah!

37
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,123
Give me a coconut.

38
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,052
Look.. Iook..

39
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,032
Give me a coconut, too.

40
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,229
Rita!

41
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,153
Allen!

42
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,240
Stop it, Allen! Stop!

43
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,200
Stop it, Allen!

44
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,025
Allen!

45
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,111
Hello. -Yes, sir.

46
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,019

I have to do now?

47
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,218
For now, you've to reach
Victor's bungalow.

48
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,118
Sharp at 10'clock.

49
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,028
You'll get the rest of the
information upon reaching.

50
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,156
But, sir.. that gun?

51
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,235
Keep it. It'll be of use.

52
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,038
Mr. Victor?

53
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,145
Please come. Mr. Victor
shall see you.

54
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,021
Hello. -Have you reached?
-Yes, sir. Sir..

55
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,051
What do I have to
do? -Shoot him.

56
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,132
What?! Sir, but..
-Just shoot him.

57
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,058
Sir.. hello.. hello..

58
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,126
Forgive me, Ranjan.

59
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,104
You had to wait a while.

60
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,172
Who are you?

61
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,019
My room keys?

62
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,088
But sir, you've already
been checked out.

63
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,158
Checked out? Your secretary
has paid for your bill too.

64
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,129
Yes, but I've a passport
and documents..

65
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,222
Your secretary has taken
everything with her.

66
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,165
She'll meet you at the airport.

67
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,069
Is there something wrong,
sir? -No, no. Thank you.

68
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,097
Don't move. Who are you?
What do you want?

69
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,067
Get moving or I'll shoot you.

70
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,070
C'mon move!

71
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,059
Hello, dear. How are you?
-I'm fine, mummy.

72
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,096
Did you have your lunch, dear?

73
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,188
Very good.

74
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,062
Excuse me. Can I make a call?

75
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,226
Yeah, sure. Why not..

76
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,038
The phone's in the bedroom,
you can come with me.

77
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,240
Madam, please. Keep
the door open.

78
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,098
Sir, it's me Allen.

79
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,066
Sir, I've done what
you sent me for.

80
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,204
I didn't want to, yet I did it.

81
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,010
But sir, somebody's
after me now.

82
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,111
What?! -Yes, sir.

83
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,215
Sir, my belongings and
passport are missing.

84
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,219
Please help me, sir.

85
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,180
Don't worry. I'll call you back.

86
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,121
Ok, sir.

87
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,228
According to reports,
an underworld gang..

88
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,070
..could be behind this murder.

89
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:55,136
This news has put the city on
alert. -Did you see the murderer?

90
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,183
Yes, of course. He
was a tall man.

91
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,110
Around 6'2 tall. He was bald.

92
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,021
He was bald.

93
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,117
I'm sure he was an European.

94
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,052
I seated him here..

95
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,190
..and went to call sir.

96
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:17,065
But when I returned, I saw
Mr. Victor's corpse lying.

97
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,047
Madam, your parcel.

98
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,118
Please sign here.

99
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,054
It's mine.

100
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,997
Hello. -Now listen to me
carefully. -Yes, sir.

101
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:26,035
Go to Lucky Spot dance
bar rightaway..

102
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,231
..you'll meet a dancer
called Shaina there.

103
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,007
She'll help you escape
from there.

104
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,076
Yes, sir. -Note down
her address.

105
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,169
Lucky Spot bar, street 71..

106
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,113
Her no. is..

107
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,084

108
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,162
Where are you from? -lndia.

109
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,108
I'm from lndia too.

110
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,075
It feels so good to meet one's
own in a foreign land.

111
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,170
This too is god's doing.

112
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,049
Do you believe in god?

113
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,111
Hey! What are you doing?

114
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,104
Lillian, you be alert.

115
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,215
Hi, handsome. Are you
looking for me?

116
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,126
2000 for whatever you say.

117
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,121
Do you see that place?

118
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,124
Lucky Spot bar.

119
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,202
Yeah. -Are you testing my eyes?

120
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,070
Shaina?

121
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,042
You won't be able to afford her.

122
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,170
I'm her friend. I need to talk
to her over the phone.

123
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,173
Money I'll take..

124
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,047
1000 for a message.

125
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,222
You would've enjoyed this
evening with me.

126
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,123
Anyway, as you like it.

127
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,201
Hello. -This is Shaina.

128
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,238
Hi, I'm Allen. I'm
Anthony's friend.

129
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,044
I need to..

130
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,051
I need to meet you. -Ok,
come to the club.

131
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,188
But how'll I recognise you?

132
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,183
Don't worry, I'll recognise you.

133
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,251
Okay.

134
00:26:52,210 --> 00:27:01,084
My youth is as restless as
a fish without water.

135
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:09,083
I'm like wild fire.. Iike
a stream of water..

136
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:16,123
My steps don't falter..
my steps don't falter..

137
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:21,229
Come, take me into your arms.

138
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,000
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

139
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,173
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

140
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,241
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

141
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:38,052
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

142
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:05,148
I wore anklets while
going to the court.

143
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:12,146
The hot summer burns my body.

144
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,025
I wore anklets while
going to the court.

145
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,123
The hot summer burns my body.

146
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:28,072
The cop rubs his palms and
teases me, thinking I'm alone.

147
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:39,048
I've been burnt to
dust like coal.

148
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:48,083
I'm like wild fire.. Iike
a stream of water..

149
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:55,031
My steps don't falter..
my steps don't falter..

150
00:28:55,133 --> 00:29:00,127
Come, take me into your arms.

151
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,999
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

152
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:09,172
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

153
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:13,048
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

154
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:17,078
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

155
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:47,143
I'm like wild fire.. Iike
a stream of water..

156
00:29:48,153 --> 00:30:00,156
My steps don't falter..
my steps don't falter..

157
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:05,192
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

158
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:09,172
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

159
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:12,200
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

160
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:16,145
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

161
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:26,114
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

162
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:31,185
Come, dive into the
well of my heart.

163
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,265
I'm Shaina. -Allen.

164
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,042
Anthony told me that.. -What
can I do for you?

165
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,045
I want a passport made.

166
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,277
It's difficult to get
a passport done now.

167
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,248
After Victor's death, the
police are on high alert.

168
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:05,059
I'm really sorry. -It's
important for me to go to lndia.

169
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,227
Actually..

170
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,195
I think I know someone..

171
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,135
..who can help you out.

172
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,166
You be right here, I'll change
and join you. -Ok.

173
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,078
I'm coming.. coming..
I'm a heavy man.

174
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,112
Hi Shaina! -Hi! -Hi baby!

175
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,214
What a surprise?! C'mon.. c'mon.

176
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,192
C'mon.. c'mon.

177
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,094
This is my friend Allen.

178
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,029
Hello. -He wants an lndian
passport made.

179
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,065
Anything for you, baby.

180
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,030
Here's 10,000 rupees.

181
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,094
Birthplace is Daman. -Sorry?

182
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,264
Birthplace is Daman.

183
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,041
Daman? Daman!

184
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,143
19th February, 1984.

185
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,011
That was a Sunday,
how were you born?

186
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,208
Oh no problem! Photographs?

187
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:35,083
It's not there. -Not there?
Don't worry, I'm there.

188
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,122
One minute.

189
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:45,027
You'll get your passport
tomorrow afternoon. Ok?

190
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,094
And till then..

191
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,067
..treat this house as your own.

192
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,094
Baby, your friend has
a sense of business.

193
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,036
Lal Singh.

194
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,074
No problem. Baby..

195
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,203
I've treasured everything
in this house.

196
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,171
Be careful. -Ok. -Ok!

197
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,149
Goodnight. -Goodnight.
Bye-bye. -Goodnight.

198
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,153
He's a bit crazy. Talks a lot.

199
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,088
But don't you worry, your
job will be done.

200
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,051
Hey, trust me. Ok?

201
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,097
Are you missing somebody?

202
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,194
Melvina.

203
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,199
I see.

204
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,136
Melvina. -For whom I came here.

205
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,208
You?! -Yes, me. Ask
me why. -Why?

206
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,144
Today evening, there's a get
together at the seaside.

207
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,021
And we've to go. -I'm
busy, Allen.

208
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,051
Work will always be there.
Please come along.

209
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,204
Hi, buddy. How are you?
-Good. How are you?

210
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,175
We always used to keep fighting.

211
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,043
What's your problem, Allen?

212
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,113
I don't like anybody eyeing you.

213
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,092
I can't tolerate somebody
hurting you. -Wow!

214
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,163
Then you'll kill somebody
because of me. -Yes, I will.

215
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,095
I might even do that if needed.

216
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,126
Then rot in jail. I won't wait
for you to return. -Don't!

217
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,228
Do whatever you want.

218
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,096
I've been so, I am
so and I'll be so.

219
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,142
If you don't want me to
interfere in any of your issues..

220
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,110
..then I won't. Come
what may. Ok? -Ok.

221
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,113
Bye. Bye.

222
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,142
Despite that we were very
close to each other.

223
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,054
Suddenly I found out that
Melvina was addicted to drugs.

224
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,059
I stopped her.

225
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,097
I explained her a lot.

226
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,090
Then she told me her problem.

227
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,204
Her parents hated each other.

228
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,233
They spent all their
time fighting.

229
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,069
They didn't have time
for Melvina.

230
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,242
And that's why Melvina was
left alone amidst her own.

231
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,219
And drugs became..

232
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,112
..her sole support.

233
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,163
I couldn't bear Melvina's
plight.

234
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,143
And I immediately decided
to marry her.

235
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,036
But maybe fate had something
else in mind.

236
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:26,139
That's when Siddharth told me
that Melvina's in the hospital.

237
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,248
Doctor, how is she?

238
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,252
Doctor, this is Allen.

239
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,187
He and Melvina were supposed
to get married today.

240
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,230
I wanted to give her a new life.

241
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,130
But..

242
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,135
..drugs lured Melvina
towards it.

243
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,166
The doctor said that repeated
drug usage had damaged her liver.

244
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,235
A liver transplant had to
be done immediately.

245
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,106
I'm sorry.

246
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,046
When I didn't want to live..

247
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,241
..then life seemed too long.

248
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:45,151
Now when I want to live
for you then..

249
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,157
..Iife doesn't seem..

250
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,066
..to have hope.

251
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,040
Please save me.

252
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,010
Melvina, nothing will
happen to you.

253
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,080
Nothing.

254
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,052
You trust me, don't you?

255
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,123
I won't let anything
happen to you.

256
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,183
You..

257
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,129
You'll be fine very soon.

258
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,157
Then we'll marry.

259
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,259
On the same beach..

260
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,162
..amidst the same friends.

261
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,175
I love you.

262
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,202
I love you.

263
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,167
When I didn't want to live..

264
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,211
Please save me.

265
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,192
Ten lakhs.

266
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,221
Putting together all
that I have..

267
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,027
..it'd amount to Rs. 15-20,000.

268
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,226
Even if I sell the garage..

269
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,160
..where will I get so
much money from?

270
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,133
Now, we need money.

271
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,013
Allen.

272
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,084
There's one man who can help us.

273
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,146
Anthony. But he..

274
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,054
..is a dangerous man.

275
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,154
I had to save Melvina
at any cost.

276
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,225
I went to Anthony
with Siddharth.

277
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,189
Just remember one thing.
He's a man of his word.

278
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,226
That boy's coming here.

279
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,088
Sir, he's Allen.

280
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,023
Hello, sir. -My best friend.

281
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,089
He's in trouble, sir.

282
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,128
This isn't a grocer's
shop, dear.

283
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,054
This is a gambling den where
you'll have to bet.

284
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,024
Sir, I can do anything
for Melvina.

285
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,035
I'm not interested in
your love story.

286
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,104
I'm only concerned
about my work.

287
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,164
Sir, what's the job? -Whatever
the job is.

288
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,139
Do you want to do it or not?

289
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,170
Sir, tell me the job.

290
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,205
I can even die for money
at this moment.

291
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,109
I only work with brave men.

292
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,221
And I've seen your bravery.

293
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,216
Khalid.

294
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,094
Here's Rs. 1 lakh.

295
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,170
You'll get the rest in Mauritius
after the job is done.

296
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,130
You've to go to Mauritius by
the morning flight tomorrow.

297
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,072
You'll get all the
job details there.

298
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,271
Best of luck.

299
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,185
You should get back to
lndia at the earliest.

300
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,214
To Melvina.

301
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,188
Hello! -Where are you, man? I've
been trying your no. for long!

302
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,165
I'm here. Forget all
that, how's Melvina?

303
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,100
Allen, Melvina is no more.

304
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:51,099
I've turned into stone.

305
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:59,132
My emotions have been
blistered by sorrow.

306
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:06,216
Such were my feelings
dimmed that..

307
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:11,181
..all radiance moved away.

308
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:21,062
A veil on fire.. time paused..

309
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:26,195
Tell me what to do, O heart.

310
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:34,239
For god's sake..
For god's sake..

311
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:46,248
For god's sake..
For god's sake..

312
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:56,099
Come to me.. come to me..

313
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:12,139
For god's sake..
For god's sake..

314
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:19,213
For god's sake..

315
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:30,158
For god's sake..
For god's sake..

316
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,098
I couldn't do anything for her.

317
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,170
Anything..

318
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,113
She kept asking me for life
and I was helpless.

319
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,052
She left me and went away.

320
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,022
And I'm so far away from her.

321
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,119
You had to live, Melvina.

322
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,065
You had to live.

323
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,184
Madam, please see if he's the
same man who pointed a gun..

324
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,118
..and kidnapped you.

325
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,178
No, he's not the one.

326
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,150
Are you sure? -Yes, of
course. I'm sure.

327
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,195
Ok, thanks. You can leave.

328
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,187
Send the body for post-mortem
and examination.

329
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,193
And I want the report very
fast. By evening, ok?

330
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,194
Yes, sir.

331
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,170
Did the gun-totting man
really kidnap you?

332
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,081
Of course, yes. When I came out
of the mall, he was in in my car..

333
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,143
..and he forcefully
took me to my home.

334
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,212
Did he try to force
you to do anything?

335
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,213
Of course, he forced me.

336
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,252
What did he do?

337
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,198
Where's he?

338
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,031
Where's he?

339
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,164
Where's he?

340
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,243
Where's he?!

341
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:37,045
C'mon..

342
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,001
Shaina.

343
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,131
Shaina.

344
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,153
One chicken burger.

345
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,191
How much? -Rs.20.

346
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,190
Allen, run.

347
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,223
Don't know who this uncle
is sitting with!

348
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,061
A black thing..

349
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,190
..wearing white clothes.

350
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:14,033
Black face, looks like a crow
stuck in a barrel of lime.

351
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,132
Phone? Shaina!

352
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,142
Hello! -Hello, Lalaji?

353
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,111
Hello! -Hello, Lalaji?

354
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,079
Hello!

355
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,240
Damn it! -Network problem.

356
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,126
Hello! -Hello!

357
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:49,103
Shaina! -Yes, this..

358
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,231
What happened to the passport?

359
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,267
The passport is ready.

360
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,044
Where should I bring it?
-We're at the Citadel.

361
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,103
Bring it here. -Ok.. ok.

362
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,047
I'll be there in two minutes.
Two minutes.

363
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:10,021
Please get down. Now
I won't go there..

364
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,149
.but here.

365
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:21,069
Don't keep honking with your
mouth, I've a horn in my car.

366
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,162
I'm already getting late..

367
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,038
..please get out with your
beautiful daughter.

368
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,134
Got it? When she laughs..

369
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,236
..it looks like somebody
has scraped an elbow.

370
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,242
A horn in a bottle!

371
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,046
Keep sitting.

372
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,143
I'm leaving.

373
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,051
Got it?

374
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,086
I don't have the time.

375
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,057
My destination is this way.

376
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,125
Keeps honking!

377
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,026
Will you honk louder than me?

378
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,154
Take this.

379
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,230
First, Magnum tower..

380
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,098
..on the terrace poolside..

381
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,110
..famous businessman
Chang was murdered.

382
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,238
Then on the same day, the
owner of Vegas casino..

383
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:07,216
..Victor was murdered
at his own house.

384
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,085
Then an lndian's dead
body is found.

385
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,122
On the highway.

386
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,055
And today..

387
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,252
..this open firing.

388
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,997
Behind all this, there's
a contract killer.

389
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,263
Khaled.

390
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,143
Allen.

391
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,205
You'll go away.

392
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,206
And I'll get back
to my old life.

393
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,179
But I'll always remember
you. -Shaina..

394
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,250
Even I'm going back
with some memories.

395
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,287
And I had come with
some memories.

396
00:53:56,266 --> 00:54:00,032
I can forget them but
not erase them.

397
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,137
You're very nice.

398
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,202
You risked your life to help me.

399
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,238
It's not so.

400
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:14,013
Actually, there are many who'll
give up their life..

401
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,210
..but you'll rarely
find people..

402
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,154
..who are worth dying for.

403
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,185
Allen..

404
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,089
I'll always be very happy that..

405
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:32,201
..whatever I did was for good.

406
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,129
Whatever be the consequences
for it!

407
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,051
Shaina!

408
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,056
I'm done for!

409
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,120
Shaina, what was the
need to come up?

410
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:04,064
Your vehicle is light,
it came up.

411
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,034
But there's a buffalo
in my car..

412
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,204
..I had to walk up all the way.

413
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,072
Had I climbed two more hills..

414
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,075
..then I'd have reached heaven.

415
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,102
Have you brought the
passport? -Yes.

416
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:24,211
Now, a tip or something..

417
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:31,027
Here. - 1000 bucks for
what? Burgers?

418
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,187
It'll do. It's enough.

419
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,224
When the sun sets..

420
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,193
..a labourer is in his spirits.

421
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,229
Tonight..

422
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,139
..I'm going to bathe in wine.

423
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:54,176
I've drunk a little..
Behold, O dear..

424
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,110
Behold, O dear..

425
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,178
Please handle me..

426
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:03,055
..I might fall.

427
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,152
The TV's turned on!

428
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:09,128
You're turned on.

429
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:13,033
I've to turn you off.
Wait, just a moment.

430
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,231
It seems even the TV is drunk.

431
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,239
Where's the remote?

432
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,209
Remote! Come out, remote.

433
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:38,091
Wow! My house..

434
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,197
..my sofa and my TV..

435
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:44,199
Wow! -Where's Allen?

436
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,228
Just a moment.

437
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:52,207
Guest, beer..

438
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,045
No? No problem.

439
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,048
Gentleman.. -Where's Allen?

440
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,051
Allen's gone to lndia.

441
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,212
I made his passport. I made it.

442
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:11,187
Only in a day. Only Lalaji
can do this job.

443
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:16,188
Where's Allen? -Allen.. Allen..

444
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,997
I.. I.. I swear that..

445
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,037
..I'll make your passport.

446
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,197
Not one but..

447
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,106
..two. Two passports.

448
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,007
One for going..

449
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,203
..and one for returning.

450
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,104
I swear on my mother and god.

451
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:48,062
Jack. -Yeah, Khaled. Job's done?

452
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,065
No. -No?!

453
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,066
What do you mean by 'no'?

454
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,159
He's gone to lndia. -What?!

455
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,194
How could he? He doesn't
even have a passport.

456
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,102
A fake passport.

457
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,080
David. -What happened?

458
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,049
Allen is going to lndia
by the evening flight.

459
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,009
What?!

460
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,123
And you're telling me now?

461
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,126
He must be in the flight by now.

462
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:21,062
If he goes to lndia and
blabbers everything..

463
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,065
..then do you know
what will happen?

464
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,091
All our efforts to
reach this level..

465
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,193
..would go to waste.

466
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,206
Our dream to set up
a base in Europe..

467
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,071
..as well as Asia..

468
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,040
..will remain a dream.

469
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,042
Damn it, Jack! Damn it!

470
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,146
How could you be so careless?

471
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,047
Relax, David.

472
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:41,208
He has left for lndia.

473
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,218
But he hasn't reached yet.

474
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,121
You and I will be together..

475
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,247
..forever.

476
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,122
And Allen will be nowhere.

477
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,162
Beside, our man can even
welcome him there.

478
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,039
Thank you.

479
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,137
Take care of yourself.

480
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:50,185
You'll always be there
in my heart..

481
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,247
..as a good friend.

482
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,073
Allen.

483
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:18,045
Promise me something.

484
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,136
What?

485
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,178
After bidding me goodbye..

486
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,121
..you won't turn back and see.

487
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,122
What are you doing here?

488
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:18,062
What the hell are you doing
here? Are you mad?

489
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,127
We'd reached the airport
with great difficulty.

490
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:25,001
You could've easily
reached Mumbai.

491
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:27,039
Only till Mumbai airport.

492
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,135
I wouldn't have reached home.

493
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,075
What?!

494
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,080
Why?

495
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,150
We'll find the answer only here.

496
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,019
You know what?

497
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,150
I was living comfortably
however it was.

498
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,029
I don't know why I agreed
to help you.

499
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,031
Drop me off at the next signal.

500
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,262
You know what?

501
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,006
Get out right now. Get out now.

502
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,042
I don't want to see your
face, just leave.

503
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,044
I killed Victor.

504
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,115
Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening, sir.

505
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,016
Can I help you? -I need 2 rooms
with inter-connecting door.

506
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,211
Yes, sir.

507
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:55,252
Thank you.

508
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,069
If you killed Victor.

509
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,037
Then why did the TV
and newspapers..

510
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,232
..give the wrong information?

511
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,107
And why was the eye witnesses..

512
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:45,079
..description of the
murderer wrong?

513
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,038
He had said that..

514
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,242
..the murderer..

515
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,213
..was 6'2 tall and..

516
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,082
..was European.

517
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,050
Good question.

518
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:00,125
Even I was wondering
about the same.

519
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,086
Allen.

520
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,065
Have you come back to find out?

521
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,255
Good morning, madam.
-Good morning.

522
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,263
I'm sorry to hear
about Mr. Victor.

523
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,094
Your dress is ready.

524
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,044
Sorry.

525
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,248
Can you pleas drop
this to my hotel?

526
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,052
Yes of course, sir.

527
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,284
Write down the address please.

528
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,126
This is my address.

529
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,230
Thanks. -Thank you.

530
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:23,268
Please pack the dress. -Ok.

531
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,177
Make it fast. -Yeah.

532
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,036
Coffee? -Ok.

533
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,265
Allen, you left as if..

534
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,240
..we're childhood pals and..

535
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,240
..I'll understand your signals.

536
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:01,242
I had gone for shopping.

537
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,109
Shopping? Early in the morning?

538
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,089
And I met Mrs. Victor there.

539
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:09,224
You met Mrs. Victor?

540
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:13,989
You must've apologised for
killing her husband.

541
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,087
You must've said sorry.

542
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,034
I gave her my address.

543
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,999
Which address? -This
address. -What?!

544
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,136
This address?

545
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,097
Great!

546
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,233
Excellent!

547
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:32,008
And when the cops come
looking for you..

548
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,074
..then will you tell them that
you're here for the carnival?

549
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,116
They'll surely come searching..

550
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,050
..but not the cops..

551
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,984
..it'd be somebody else.

552
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,139
Morning, sir. -We've a guest
by the name..

553
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:36,076
..of Mr. Allen
staying with you.

554
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,138
Yes, sir. Room no. 203.

555
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,105
This way.

556
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,052
Thank you. -You're welcome, sir.

557
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,077
Sir, your room is ready.

558
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,076
Drop the gun.

559
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,026
Are you lndian?

560
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,228
Pakistan.

561
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,131
And your death warrant.

562
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:20,266
Since when have you known me?

563
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,035
You don't need to know that
for killing somebody.

564
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,273
Even you were given my
photographs and..

565
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,245
..told to vanish after
killing me.

566
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,241
Right?

567
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:35,123
Your general knowledge is good.

568
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,054
But yours is bad.

569
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:38,250
Is it?

570
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:42,087
You haven't realised yet that
we work for the same person.

571
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,066
Victor's younger brother, David.

572
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:48,065
What proof do you have?

573
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,070
You're the proof.

574
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,037
He first sent me here
to kill Victor.

575
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:55,008
And then he sent you to kill me.

576
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,238
He might send somebody to
kill you.. -Stop it.

577
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,269
I don't believe you.

578
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,243
If I make you believe, then?

579
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,049
Where are we headed?

580
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:13,252
To Victor's place.

581
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:16,258
Why? -I had booked that
hotel in my real name..

582
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,123
..Allen.

583
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:22,035
Nobody knew my real name
or about this hotel.

584
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,140
And they informed you
instead of the cops.

585
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,238
That proves that David is
involved in all this.

586
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:31,238
And a family member is involved
in Victor's death.

587
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,140
We don't have a choice
but to kill David.

588
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,015
Have you gone crazy?

589
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,089
Did you ever think I didn't
return to lndia?

590
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,252
My life is as much in danger
there, as it is here.

591
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,087
And you won't be safe
in Pakistan either.

592
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:50,028
If you reach there, that is.

593
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,261
If we've to live then we'll
have to finish off David.

594
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:58,230
You've missed your aim thrice.

595
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,236
I missed thrice.

596
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,074
But my mission isn't over yet.

597
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,214
Don't forget that.

598
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,243
In the world of crime,
all know..

599
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,246
..that Khaled's aim..

600
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,012
..can't be survived
and if they do..

601
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:18,123
..it means Khaled isn't alive.

602
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:21,087
And that's impossible.

603
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,225
Because Khaled can never die.

604
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:34,228
Come, madam.

605
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,076
Is he the same man who broke
into your house with a gun?

606
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,980
No, he's another man.

607
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,239
Another man?

608
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,252
Yes, he came to ask about
the first man.

609
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,248
That means, the one
who kidnapped you..

610
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,253
..wasn't Khaled.

611
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:01,160
Oh my god, what have
I got into?!

612
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:03,164
They can't find the one
they want, but..

613
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,065
..they call me for
identification all the time.

614
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,035
By the way, inspector..

615
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,035
..the press isn't here?

616
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,073
Inspector.. inspector!

617
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,038
What do you know..

618
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,043
..about that lndian guy?

619
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,238
Indian guy?

620
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,072
Yes, the one..

621
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:24,150
..who came to Mauritius the
day your brother was shot.

622
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,146
And after that he checked
into hotel Royal Garden.

623
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,021
Inspector..

624
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:35,059
I don't know any
such lndian guy.

625
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:38,266
The body lying outside
your house..

626
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,101
..Khaled.

627
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,027
He was looking for
the same lndian.

628
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,231
But it seems the lndian
proved tough for him.

629
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,100
What the lnterpol..

630
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,043
..couldn't do in 14 years..

631
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,238
..that lndian did it.

632
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:54,012
This is all nonsense.

633
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:55,242
I don't have anything
to do about it.

634
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,108
You do. Yes, you do.

635
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,016
Khaled is the world's
most expensive..

636
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:02,113
..contract killer.

637
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,049
And his..

638
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,056
..body was found outside
your house.

639
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,121
This gives a message.

640
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,021
That's what I believe.

641
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,155
Message?

642
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,126
Do you know Ranjan Verma?

643
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:17,104
Yes, of course. He's
our personal lawyer.

644
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:19,240
All legal matters outside Asia..

645
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,133
..is handled by him.

646
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:24,143
That lndian checked into the
hotel as Ranjan Verma.

647
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,144
And maybe he used that name..

648
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,045
..to enter this house.

649
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:30,148
But the lndian guy who..

650
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,016
..entered our house and..

651
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,146
..shot my brother..

652
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,985
..wasn't lndian.

653
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:39,084
How do you know that?

654
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:41,094
You said that you..

655
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,029
..hadn't seen that man.

656
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,061
Jackson..

657
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,157
..told Jenny about it.

658
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:49,133
Jack told Jenny..

659
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:51,061
..and..

660
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,064
..Jenny told..

661
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,140
..you about it. Wow!

662
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:59,042
Do you know? This was
misguiding me.

663
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:03,117
Everything was perfectly fine
as per my investigation.

664
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:06,049
Except for this Jack..

665
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:09,090
..and Jenny's statements.

666
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,993
Come.. come Mrs. Victor.

667
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,995
Please come. We were
talking about you.

668
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,029
I hope you didn't lie.

669
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:23,228
Because if you were lying then..

670
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,031
..it means that your
family member..

671
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,134
..was involved in Mr. Victor's
death.

672
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,239
And if that is the case,
then I'd assume..

673
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,015
..that behind your husband's
death, you..

674
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:36,141
..and David had a hand.

675
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,008
But..

676
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:40,111
How can you say such a thing
without any evidence?

677
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,055
Evidence? You need evidence?

678
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,058
I'll get those evidence
for you, ok?

679
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,017
Inspector..

680
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:50,030
Do you realise that you're
making an enemy out of me?

681
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:53,224
Don't threaten me with
your connections?

682
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:56,263
And you're not in the position
to threaten anybody.

683
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,231
I've understood the
truth very well.

684
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,270
And maybe even you would've
understood.

685
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:05,236
I'm frustrated that despite
knowing everything..

686
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,146
..you'll escape unharmed.

687
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,108
After the new drugs
and arms deal..

688
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:13,019
..you'll earn even more.

689
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:14,988
And there are such people
in your gang..

690
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:19,060
..who won't hesitate to shoot
anybody for profits.

691
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:22,153
Excuse me. I don't think my
associates would do such a thing.

692
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:23,992
Associates?!

693
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,228
Which associates? They're
all bloody criminals!

694
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:31,034
They work on the principles
of the underworld.

695
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,032
And if they come to know that..

696
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,270
..you and Mrs. Victor..

697
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,010
..have a hand in your
brother's death..

698
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:41,072
..then the game would
be over for you.

699
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,049
And your so-called associates..

700
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,211
..will betray you.

701
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,149
And the consequences of that..

702
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,015
..is something we don't want.

703
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,254
Our commissioner doesn't
want it either.

704
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,154
A gang war.

705
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:57,293
I won't let this happen
in your city.

706
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,069
And this is our commissioner's
orders, that's why..

707
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,071
..you're still safe here.

708
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,069
But remember one thing..

709
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,065
..you won't escape this..

710
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,078
..for long.

711
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:22,046
Don't worry.

712
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:25,259
This inspector is mistaken
about us.

713
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,255
So was brother.

714
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:37,231
You should return to lndia
at the earliest.

715
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:40,031
Now you even have a passport.

716
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,033
David won't spare you here.

717
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:46,078
And they will kill
you after I leave.

718
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:55,086
Don't worry about me. I'll
take care of myself.

719
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,097
A few years back..

720
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,227
..even I had a chance to
get out of this rut..

721
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,001
..I didn't go.

722
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,073
Since that day..

723
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,237
..I've been here.

724
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,237
You've your own house there.

725
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:22,141
You've your friends.
Your own life.

726
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:27,213
What life? Which life?

727
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,029
This is an opportunity for me..

728
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,157
..to start a new life.

729
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,126
I don't want to lose it.

730
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:14,026
With your memories in
my heart, I tread on.

731
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:21,133
Why is sleep resting
in my eyes?

732
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:29,075
With your memories in
my heart, I tread on.

733
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:36,146
Why is sleep resting
in my eyes?

734
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:43,993
I don't know where my
steps might lead to..

735
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:47,033
Where my goal is..

736
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:52,165
Where lies my path!

737
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:25,228
It's the season of desires.

738
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:32,241
I need to tell you about
my heart's feelings.

739
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:41,020
Like the dew and the morning..

740
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:48,085
..Iets spend the nights
with each other.

741
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:56,066
I'll be your shade in the sun.

742
01:22:57,138 --> 01:23:03,008
May we never separate!

743
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:11,082
With your memories in
my heart, I tread on.

744
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:18,285
Why is sleep resting
in my eyes?

745
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:26,057
I don't know where my
steps might lead to.

746
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:33,040
Where my goal is.. where
lies my path!

747
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:09,233
The flight is at 4.30.

748
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,272
You go ahead, I'll join you.

749
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,133
Hi. -Khalid.

750
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:12,230
Allen, he's Sly.

751
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,042
The local arms dealer. -Hi.

752
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:18,007
He'll help us against David.

753
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,015
We have the weapons
and the manpower.

754
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,982
You'll get as much as you want.

755
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:27,077
Don't worry, I'm with you.

756
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,018
Glory unto Lord Jesus..

757
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:43,021
..who is all compassionate,
all merciful.

758
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:46,158
Friends, we all have gathered..

759
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:48,222
..over here to pray..

760
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,022
..for the departed soul
of Mr. Victor..

761
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,991
..who had an untimely death.

762
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,134
May Lord Jesus..

763
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:59,137
..grant peace to the
departed soul.

764
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,065
And may he give enough
strength..

765
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:05,205
..to his family members..

766
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,048
..and friends to be at
this irrepairable..

767
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:39,091
When shall it dawn, the streets
and the windows..

768
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:44,095
..wear a deserted look.

769
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:51,171
When will I reach my goal..

770
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:56,132
..my eyes yearn.

771
01:31:56,177 --> 01:32:01,114
I'm breathless.

772
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:05,278
The paths are silent.

773
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:11,218
Show me a way..

774
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:20,126
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

775
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:30,167
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

776
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:52,055
Come to me.. come to me..

777
01:32:57,271 --> 01:33:06,179
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

778
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:15,046
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

779
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:22,290
With hopes in my eyes..

780
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:30,169
I roam the streets.
What is this irony?

781
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:36,101
What is this irony?

782
01:33:57,264 --> 01:34:03,225
I've turned to stone.
My emotions..

783
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:08,237
..are blistered with sorrow.

784
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:15,114
Such were my feelings
dimmed that..

785
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:20,117
..all radiance moved away.

786
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:29,153
A veil on fire.. time paused..

787
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:35,257
Tell me what to do, O heart.

788
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:45,007
For god's sake..
For god's sake..

789
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:55,044
For god's sake..
For god's sake..

790
01:34:56,257 --> 01:35:07,031
Come to me.. come to me..

791
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:15,234
For god's sake..

792
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:21,046
For god's sake..

793
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:25,017
For god's sake..

794
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:34,994
For god's sake..

795
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:39,158
For god's sake..

796
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:25,135
When shall it dawn, the streets
and the windows..

797
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:29,115
..wear a deserted look.

798
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:34,144
When will I reach my goal..

799
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:38,122
..my eyes yearn.

800
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:47,193
I'm breathless. The paths are
silent. Show me a way..

801
01:37:04,051 --> 01:37:11,048
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

802
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:17,256
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

803
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:55,125
Come to me.. come to me..

804
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:07,106
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

805
01:38:07,147 --> 01:38:12,210
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

806
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:19,090
With hopes in my eyes..

807
01:38:19,126 --> 01:38:25,031
I roam the streets.
What is this irony?

808
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:49,215
I've turned to stone.
My emotions..

809
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:53,158
..are blistered with sorrow.

810
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:58,188
Such were my feelings
dimmed that..

811
01:38:58,299 --> 01:39:02,065
..all radiance moved away.

812
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:09,031
A veil on fire.. time paused..

813
01:39:09,076 --> 01:39:13,069
Tell me what to do, O heart.

814
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:20,209
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

815
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:26,982
For god's sake..
for god's sake..

816
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:37,129
Come to me.. come to me..

817
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:47,237
For god's sake..

For god's sake..
