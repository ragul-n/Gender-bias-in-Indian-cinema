1
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,041
Ready?

2
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,000
{\an8}Has someone stabbed you in the back?

3
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,708
{\an8}Have you been betrayed?

4
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,083
{\an8}Is your life's train stuck
at Loneliness Station?

5
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,875
{\an8}Do you have an HDTV at
home but no one to watch it with you?

6
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:21,000
{\an8}Do you have many contacts
on your phone but nobody to talk to?

7
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,125
{\an8}Are you living in fear and frustration?

8
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,875
{\an8}Is suicide a better alternative

9
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,208
{\an8}than dealing with loneliness?

10
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,291
{\an8}But...

11
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,583
{\an8}I won't let that happen.

12
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,375
{\an8}I, Ramchandra Negi, an
International Loneliness detective,

13
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,333
won't let that happen.

14
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,166
{\an8}I will come to your house.

15
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,625
I will share your food and water.

16
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,500
I'll share your bed

17
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,416
{\an8}and I will cure your loneliness.

18
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:51,125
So, call 1800-Ramchandra Negi today.

19
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,666
Your International Loneliness detective.

20
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,291
<i>Good morning, Prahastha.</i>

21
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,333
<i>We'll be touching</i>
<i>down in 30 minutes.</i>

22
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:46,916
<i>Okay?</i>

23
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,625
<i>Yesterday...</i>

24
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,708
{\an8}<i>as part of the</i>
<i>Rakshas Manushya Peace Treaty,</i>

25
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,833
{\an8}<i>20 more mega-spaceships</i>
<i>were launched.</i>

26
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,500
{\an8}<i>-They'll help in human transition.</i>
<i>-And Astronaut Duryodhan,</i>

27
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,833
{\an8}<i>after spending 75 years in space,</i>

28
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,791
{\an8}<i>has retired and will</i>
<i>be returning to Earth.</i>

29
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,000
<i>We have a fresh batch</i>
<i>of students graduating</i>

30
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,875
<i>from the National Technology</i>
<i>of Transition University.</i>

31
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,958
<i>They'll be joining the existing</i>
<i>spaceships as assistants.</i>

32
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,416
{\an8}<i>Six astronauts</i>
<i>were sent to space</i>

33
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,750
{\an8}<i>in accordance with the historic</i>
<i>peace treaty signed 75 years ago.</i>

34
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,166
<i>He is one of them.</i>

35
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,791
<i>This treaty led to de-escalation in the</i>
<i>cold war between humans and demons.</i>

36
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,625
<i>We have a light day today.</i>

37
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,666
<i>Prahastha?</i>

38
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,500
Every day is a light day for you, sir.

39
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,208
<i>Can you hear me, Prahastha?</i>

40
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,000
Local impact on communication module.

41
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,083
<i>Prahastha!</i>

42
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,708
<i>Prahastha!</i>

43
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,000
I need to go out in the field,
I guess.

44
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,625
Okay, going code red.

45
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,833
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Hello--</i>

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,958

00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,791
<i>We are 35,000 km</i>

<i>Prahastha, can you hear us?</i>

54
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,125
<i>Yes, Mr. Nitigya, I can hear you.</i>

55
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,916
The communication is back up.
Go ahead.

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,875
<i>Prahastha, the cargo</i>

57

<i>Setting up communication link.</i>

58
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,458
<i>Okay.</i>

59

<i>Countdown start.</i>

60
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,083
<i>Ten...</i>

<i>Name, KC Sarkar.</i>

72
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,625
<i>Age, 72.</i>

73
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,708
Mr. KC Sarkar?

74
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,375
You just died of a
sudden heart attack.

75
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,750
I'm Prahastha, a demon from
the Post-Death Transition Services

76
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,916
and I welcome you to Pushpak 634A.

77
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,750
It's time we transition
you to your next life.

78
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,958
Please follow me.

79
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,666
{\an8}WELCOME TO PDTS

80
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,208
{\an8}Sir, please place all your
belongings in this tray.

81
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,125
Please follow me for
the remaining formalities.

82
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,750
Sir, please place both
your palms here.

83
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,750
Mr. Nitigya!

84
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,250
There is a pigeon with the cargo.

85
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
<i>Yes, I saw it.</i>

86
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,541
<i>Please focus on the main cargo.</i>

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,875
Do you feel any pain?

88
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,708
Because I can heal it.

89
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,291
This instrument is a little faulty,

90
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,500
but you should be fine.

91
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,125
It won't erase any
scars you might have,

92
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,125
but otherwise, it will
completely repair your body.

93
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,416
Sir... please come with me.

94
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,000
Going for final extraction.

95
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,083
Okay.

96
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,583
Extraction complete.

97
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,166
Transition successful.

98
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,625
<i>Standby for cargo.</i>

99
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,333
Thank you! Thank you!

100
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:19,916
Thank you!

101
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,000
Post-Death Transition Services.

102
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,458
Back in ancient times, this is
what humans thought we looked like.

103
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,708
This.

104
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,208
Yamraj (Lord of death) and sons,

105
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,875
every time they felt like it,

106
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,250
stepped out for
their nightly excursions

107
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,666
and transitioned the soul of
any dead human they found.

108
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,125
They were called "The scavengers".

109
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,291
In this small factory,

110
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,750
my late grandfather laid the vision
of Post-Death Transition Services.

111
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,166
And we started storing and accounting
souls on computers and data centers.

112
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,041
<i>After 15 years of</i>
<i>immeasurable hard work,</i>

113
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,625
<i>the Rakshas Manushya Peace Treaty</i>
<i>was signed.</i>

114
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,500
<i>Post that, we launched</i>
<i>the Pushpak Series.</i>

115
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,416
<i>We sent the first six</i>
<i>astronauts to space.</i>

116
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,500
<i>Today, we have our own universities.</i>

117
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,041
<i>We have our international headquarters</i>
<i>and offices all over the world.</i>

118
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,250
<i>And as you can see,</i>

119
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,916
<i>we have brought about</i>
<i>a very positive change</i>

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,625
<i>in the public image</i>
<i>of the Demon-kind.</i>

121
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,583
If you want to be a
part of this movement...

122
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:47,583
then please write to us
at careers@PDTS.gov.

123
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,708
Let's make afterlives better.

124
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,125
Ma'am, are you okay?

125
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,458
Can you call Ashok?

126
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,583
Who?

127
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,666
Ashok!

128
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,833
Who's Ashok?

129
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,000
My son.

130
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,041
I didn't even use it.

131
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,666
I just switch it on,
and it stuns me.

132
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,125
<i>How long has this been happening?</i>

133
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,791
<i>Did you drop it?</i>

134
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,625
No, sir.
I didn't drop it.

135
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,125
Please have it replaced
as soon as you can.

136
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,875
<i>Actually, there is a rumor that the</i>
<i>factory which made it is shutting down.</i>

137
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,875
<i>They violated some regulations.</i>

138
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,000
<i>There's one task you haven't</i>
<i>completed yet, Prahastha.</i>

139
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,708
<i>You haven't sent the training</i>
<i>video for new recruits.</i>

140
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,625
<i>It's really important--</i>

141
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,916
Sir, let's do this.

142
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,666
Send me two bottles and I will fill it
with my blood and send it back to you.

143
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,583
<i>Actually...</i>

144
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,916
<i>you have to be more social.</i>

145
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,875
<i>Look at the other astronauts...</i>

146
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,291
<i>they send so many videos</i>
<i>about their lives in space.</i>

147
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,416
<i>They are social media celebrities.</i>

148
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:09,833
<i>And you, on the other hand,</i>

149
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,208
<i>you don't even bother</i>
<i>replying to your fan mails.</i>

150
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,125
<i>You've been up there</i>
<i>for so many years.</i>

151
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,333
<i>Has anyone ever seen you?</i>

152
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,166
<i>Maybe it's just me.</i>

153
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,458
<i>By the way, your assistant</i>
<i>has arrived at the base station.</i>

154
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,875
<i>I'll connect you</i>
<i>tomorrow for a chat.</i>

155
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,458
I don't need an assistant, sir.

156

<i>An assistant will increase</i>
<i>the ship's throughput.</i>

157
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,208
You didn't give me an assistant
when I had asked for one!

158
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,291
Now I don't need one.

159

00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,166
<i>That's nice.</i>

176
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm being told as well, sir.

177
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,416
<i>It will be nice...</i>

178
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,375
<i>if you have an assistant.</i>

179
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,041
<i>You can finally retire as well.</i>

180
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,458
I won't retire, Mr. Chaitanya.

181
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,000
This is where I die.

182
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,666
<i>A magician came to my ship today.</i>

183
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,291
<i>And he reminded me of our</i>
<i>training station's magician mailman.</i>

184
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:41,666
<i>Remember him?</i>

185
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,208
<i>He would do magic</i>
<i>shows at night,</i>

186
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,958
<i>and during the day, he would</i>
<i>deliver letters to the wrong addresses.</i>

187
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,750
<i>When you finally</i>
<i>agreed to our first date</i>

188
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,208
<i>I went to him for advice and he told</i>
<i>me to get you butterscotch ice cream.</i>

189
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,333
<i>That's how I could win you over.</i>

190
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,708
<i>And I did win you over.</i>

191
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,958
<i>For years, I thought that you agreed</i>
<i>to date me because of that ice cream</i>

192
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,250
<i>and not because of me.</i>

193
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,500
<i>Hello and welcome today.</i>

194
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,083
<i>Today we have with us...</i>

195
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,125
<i>Ronjoy.</i>

196
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,958
<i>Ronjoy, what is your special talent?</i>

197
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,666
<i>Nothing special, ma'am.</i>
<i>I just have a tail.</i>

198
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,416
<i>Why are you guys laughing?</i>

199
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,375
<i>Okay, so, what exactly are</i>
<i>you planning to do with it?</i>

200
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,333
<i>You can do many things with it.</i>

201
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,541
<i>You have to find</i>
<i>your own strength.</i>

202
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,375
<i>You have to become self-reliant.</i>

203
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,083
<i>What do you guys say?</i>

204
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:53,708
RAMCHANDRA NEGI
INTERNATIONAL LONELINESS DETECTIVE

205
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,500
Sir, why are you hitting me?

206
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,416
Give me the stick!

207
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Please come.

208
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,666
Aren't you Mr. Mistry's younger son?

209
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,916
Sorry?

210
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,625
Why are you hiding here?

211
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,208
<i>Prahastha...</i>

212
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,125
<i>I'm connecting your call.</i>

213
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,083
<i>Your assistant is in the base area.</i>

214
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,541
<i>We'll...</i>

215
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,125
<i>send your assistant this</i>
<i>week if the weather holds up.</i>

216
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,458
<i>Have a word with your assistant.</i>

217
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,416
<i>Okay.</i>

218
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,666
Hello.

219
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,750
<i>Hello, sir! This is Yuvishka</i>
<i>Shekhar reporting.</i>

220
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,500
<i>Thank you so much for</i>
<i>having me in the extraction bay.</i>

221
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,208
<i>Actually, I'm a big fan.</i>

222
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,333
<i>I have been following your</i>
<i>work and your reports--</i>

223
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,291
One minute.

224
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,166
Are you my new assistant?

225
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,083
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

226
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:34,166
<i>And, sir, I'm very thankful for this</i>
<i>wonderful and exciting opportunity.</i>

227
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,458
<i>My vision is to make our ship</i>
<i>the best spaceship and ensure that</i>

228
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,458
<i>we do the most</i>
<i>number of transitions.</i>

229
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,666
Okay, I'm assuming you
have done some training.

230
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,583
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

231
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,625
<i>I am the valedictorian of the institute.</i>

232
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,625
<i>And...</i>

233
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,375
<i>I also have some social</i>
<i>service experience.</i>

234
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,708
<i>And, sir, additionally...</i>

235
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,791
<i>I have healing powers as well.</i>

236
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,958
Healing powers?

237
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,833
<i>Yes, if there is any cargo</i>
<i>with any kind of injury or ailment,</i>

238
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,833
<i>I can heal them.</i>

239
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>I have this power because</i>
<i>of my mother's genes.</i>

240
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,250
Okay.

241
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,291
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

242
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,333
<i>Okay, sir.</i>
<i>See you this week.</i>

243
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,041
Mr. Nitigya?

244
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,833
<i>Tell me, Prahastha.</i>

245
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,291
Can I have...

246
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,000
a male assistant?

247
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,458
<i>What?</i>

248
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,583
I mean...

249
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,791
like, you have chosen
a female assistant.

250
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,291
-Can you send a male assistant instead?
<i>-Prahastha!</i>

251
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,083
<i>I hope you are saying</i>
<i>this off the record.</i>

252
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,291
<i>You have been in space for a</i>
<i>long time. Maybe you aren't aware.</i>

253
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,916
<i>Women have overtaken</i>
<i>men down here.</i>

254
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,625
<i>If men have reached the moon,</i>
<i>the women have reached Mars!</i>

255
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,291
<i>By the time men reach Mars,</i>
<i>women will be on Jupiter.</i>

256
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,791
<i>You could be deemed guilty of</i>
<i>gender discrimination for your statement.</i>

257
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,750
Okay, I'm sorry.

258
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,500
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

259
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,333
<i>Mr. Temchand, can you tell</i>
<i>us about your special power?</i>

260
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,208
<i>I can dry any wet object immediately.</i>

261
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,625
<i>That's nice!</i>

262
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,833
<i>Why does the audience</i>
<i>find everything funny?</i>

263
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,000
<i>The textile industry could</i>
<i>really use your power.</i>

264
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,708
<i>You can help them out.</i>

265
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,500
<i>We could use you to dry cricket fields.</i>

266
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,375
<i>Your power is really useful!</i>

267
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:55,291
<i>What have you done with your power?</i>

268
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,125
<i>Well, I use it to dry clothes at home.</i>

269
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,541
<i>You see, this is the problem.</i>
<i>You have to be progressive!</i>

270
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,208
-<i>Having power and not exploring</i>
-Mr. Chaitanya!

271
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,875
<i>its potential is disastrous!</i>

272
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,583
<i>Today we want, sorry,</i>
<i>what's your name?</i>

273
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,000
<i>-Temchand...</i>
<i>-Temchand!</i>

274
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:10,958
Mr. Chaitanya!

275
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,958
I have known you
for many years now.

276
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,958
But I've never asked you this.

277
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,666
What are your powers?

278
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,708
<i>I don't sleep.</i>

279
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,000
<i>I haven't slept since</i>
<i>I was ten years old.</i>

280
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,916
<i>My body regenerates automatically.</i>

281
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,208
<i>People said I could only</i>
<i>grow up to be a watchman.</i>

282
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:44,041
<i>Everyone would sleep and</i>
<i>I would stare at them like a ghost.</i>

283
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,916
<i>Well, I am a watchman.</i>

284
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,083
<i>But I am a watchman for IPSO!</i>

285
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,791
<i>Good morning, Prahastha.</i>

286
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,916
<i>Sorry for waking you up early.</i>
<i>But I do have some good news!</i>

287
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:18,666
<i>Because of the route being clear, we</i>
<i>have dispatched your assistant, Yuvishka.</i>

288
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,166
<i>She will arrive in five minutes.</i>

289
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,708
Five minutes?

290
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,666
Why didn't you wake me up?

291
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,333
<i>We thought we should let</i>
<i>you sleep and not disturb you.</i>

292
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,250
<i>Hatch is opening.</i>

293
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,666
<i>Pod is descending.</i>

294
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,083
Hello, Ms. Yuvishka!

295
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,166
I welcome you to Pushpak 634A.

296
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,333
Come on.

297
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,750
I'll take that one.

298
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,833
Hello, this is Yuvishka
reporting from Pushpak 634A.

299
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,833
I successfully landed here...

300
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:54,041
at 02:39 EST
and 05:29 Local Time.

301
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:59,291
Astronaut Prahastha has
very warmly welcomed me.

302
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,791
Yes, Ms. Vasundhara?

303
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,083
Yes, I have landed.

304
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,750
Yes, of course.

305
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,583
Yes, he's here.

306
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,750
One second.

307
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,458
Sir!

308
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,166
We have a designer in our base.

309
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,958
She's a really huge fan.

310
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,416
Can you talk to her?

311
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,083
Yes?

312
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:30,750
Yes, yes.

313
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,875
The climate here is--

314
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,583
No! Please, no!

315
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,750
There are a lot more boxes.

316
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:43,916
I'm keeping them here.

317
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,250
<i>We will enter the</i>
<i>orbit in 30 seconds.</i>

318
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,166
Mr. Nitigya!

319
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,416
Good morning!

320
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,333
I told you I would
get here in 48 hours!

321
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,541
-Aren't you shocked?
<i>-Actually, it's Mr. Prahastha</i>

322
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,916
<i>who's really shocked!</i>

323
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,833
So, Mr. Nitigya--

324
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,833
Well, Mr. Nitigya, you are
looking pretty good on the screen.

325
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,333
<i>It's my new shirt.</i>

326
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,791
<i>My wife gave it to me yesterday.</i>

327
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,041
And you're wearing
it the very next day?

328
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,291
Why not save it?

329
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,000
<i>There's a joy in being impulsive!</i>

330
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,208
<i>Standby for cargo.</i>

331
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:32,958
<i>Countdown start.</i>

332
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,041
<i>Ten...</i>

333

<i>nine...</i>

334
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,708
<i>eight...</i>

335
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:37,916
<i>seven...</i>

336
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,166
<i>six...</i>

00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:45,875
<i>one...</i>

342
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,291
<i>O.</i>

343
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:58,541
Hello?

344
00:24:58,958 --> 00:24:59,791
Yeah.

345
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,291
I'll call Rakesh.
You can replace Vishesh.

346
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,208
And Vishesh can replace Ramesh.

347
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,166
Correct.

348
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,083
Okay, I'm about to enter an elevator.
I'll call you in a minute.

349
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay, bye.

350
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,333
What the hell!

351
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,041
Hello?

352
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,750
Yes, man!
I'm on my way.

353
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,750
One minute!

354
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,166
What the hell!

355
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,541
<i>Please close the door.</i>

356
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,958
<i>Please close the door.</i>

357
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:36,708
Hello?

358
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,125
Hello, can you hear me?

359
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,250
Mr. Bhavesh Joshi?

360
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,375
You've died in an elevator crash.

361
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,791
I'm Prahastha and I welcome
you to Pushpak 634A--

362
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:49,875
Hello?

363
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:50,833
Sir.

364
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,500
My name is Yuvishka.

365
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:58,291
I'm an agent of the
Post-Death Transition Services.

366
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,291
And I welcome you here.

367
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,166
Okay.

368
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,250
Phone.

369
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,708
The other one.

370
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:26,916
Come in.

371
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:31,875
Sir!

372
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,291
I request you to place

373
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,291
your hands on
the scanning machine.

374
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:37,583
-Here?
-Yes.

375
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,041
Okay.

376
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,333
Ma'am, will I get my phone
back once this is done?

377
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:45,333
No, sir. All your
belongings will be discarded.

378
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:50,541
Well, I've been working on an
important deal for the past year.

379
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,291
-One phone call--
-It's against the rules.

380
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,916
Listen, if you cooperate with me,

381
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,416
I'll cooperate with you as well, right?

382
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,375
-But--
-Thank you.

383
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:00,500
Sir!

384
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,291
-Sir!
-Just a minute!

385
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,333
Sir, you're not allowed to do this.

386
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:04,291
-Please!
-Hello? Yeah, Vikesh!

387
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,666
Vikesh, I need you
to replace Rakesh...

388
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,083
and give the apartment to Ramesh.

389
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,916
This isn't a demo,
this is fieldwork!

390
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,166
Let them make a down payment.
That's important!

391
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,583
-Sir... please!
-Okay, thank you. I'm done.

392
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,541
Okay, bye.

393
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,416
I request you to sit here.

394
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,541
What is this?

395
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,708
Don't worry, just relax.

396
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,416
I mean, what does this machine do?

397
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,083
Sir, this is a memory wipe device.

398
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,166
Your memories will be wiped out.

399
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:43,250
But don't worry,
it's a tried-and-true method.

400
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,000
Sir?

401
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,250
I'm sorry!

402
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,250
I can't do this.

403
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,666
What did you reveal it to the cargo?

404
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,541
Because the new cargo
interaction handbook says,

405
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,583
we should inform the cargo
about every procedure we conduct.

406
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,708
-Handbook?
-Yes.

407
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,541
So, I need to learn about
the handbook from you?

408
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,000
This is Mr. Bhavesh Joshi.
He is my first cargo.

409
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,000
First, we cleared his memory.

410
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:20,750
And this is our extraction bay
where his body will be extracted.

411
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,666
Mr. Nitigya!

412
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,125
Is she really the best candidate
you could send up here?

413
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,125
Because if she is,
I'm really worried about our university.

414
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,833
I am drowning in work up here--

415
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,000
<i>Relax, relax, Prahastha!</i>

416
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,916
<i>It's her first day.</i>
<i>She's bound to make mistakes.</i>

417
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,458
Mistakes are a different thing, sir.

418
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,250
Give it a thought and tell me,
do you, personally, think

419
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,500
that she's the best candidate?

420
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:42,666
Excuse me, sir?

421
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,750
Mr. Prahastha...
are you complaining about me?

422
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
No, I'm not complaining.
We're just discussing.

423
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:52,083
Mr. Nitigya, he uses really
outdated techniques and protocols.

424
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,041
Outdated?

425
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:56,125
You weren't happy when I
mentioned the new handbook.

426
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,041
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

427
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,708
<i>The next cargo is very critical.</i>

428
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,250
<i>I suggest you two</i>
<i>co-operate with each other.</i>

429
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,333
<i>Okay?</i>

430
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,375
Sure, sir.

431
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:10,500
And you told me she has
some latest healing powers?

432
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,958
I haven't seen a single sign of it yet.

433
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,791
<i>Let's deal with this at night.</i>

434
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,291
<i>Okay...</i>

435
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,500
<i>come to cargo area.</i>

436
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,875
<i>Cargo is entering soon.</i>

437
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:40,750
-<i>What are you waiting for?</i>
-No, stop.

438
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,458
Can you dance?

439
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:44,250
Yes, sir.
I can dance like Ryan Gosling.

440
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,750
-May I?
-Try something different.

441
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,541
Can you perform stunts?

442
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,625
Yes, of course.

443
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,458
Okay, that's all we need.
Meet us tomorrow.

444
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,458
Okay.

445
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,041
-Alright, bye.
-Tomorrow? Are you sure?

446
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,208
Yes, thank you, bye.

447
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,416
Call the body double.

448
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,666
Please get the ladder!

449
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:00,750
<i>Sir...</i>

450
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,291
<i>I go straight...</i>

451
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,583
<i>I take a left...</i>

452
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,916
<i>I turn right...</i>

453
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,041
<i>and then you set the fire...</i>

454
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,791
<i>and crush me with rocks.</i>

455
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And in the next scene,
we'll throw some snakes at you.

456
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,041
<i>Can we do a rehearsal for safety?</i>

457
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:16,000
No, let's go for take.
Let's keep the momentum going.

458
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,333
<i>Okay, sir.</i>
<i>Let's go for the final take.</i>

459
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,125
Okay, let's have a rehearsal.

460
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,291
Come on.

461
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,291
Action!

462
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,875
One, two, three!

463
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,083
Sir, can I try healing him?

464
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,916
No, Ms. Yuvishka.
You'll just be an observer for this cargo.

465
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,583
Sir, these machines have been--

466
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,791
There are batteries in
your room please get them.

467
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,041
Sir--

468
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,583
Please, we don't have the time!
Quick!

469
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:58,750
Sir.

470
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,458
<i>Prahastha this is taking too long.</i>

471
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,583
Sir, just give me five minutes.

472
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,000
<i>Can Yuvishka try?</i>

473
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,666
<i>Please... let Yuvishka try.</i>

474
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,583
Sir, please let me try.

475
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,625
Sir, please.

476
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,250
Go!

477
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,458
Sir, can you please step back?

478
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:30,708
What?

479
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:32,916
I am not being able to focus.

480
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,541
Are you really capable
of handling this case?

481
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:36,833
Sir, please.

482
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:32,791
All my life, I was just an
extra and a stuntman.

483
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,416
I hope that I become
Salman Khan in my next life.

484
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:17,375
{\an8}<i>This is the first time I'm</i>
<i>going live from Pushpak 634A.</i>

485
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:18,875
{\an8}<i>This is very exciting for me.</i>

486
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:23,541
{\an8}<i>Here we keep the gravity</i>
<i>and temperature under control.</i>

487
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,958
{\an8}<i>As you can see, this is my toy</i>
<i>and it is working perfectly well.</i>

488
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,666
{\an8}<i>Some people want to</i>
<i>know where we sleep?</i>

489
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,791
{\an8}<i>So... this is it.</i>

490
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:37,250
{\an8}<i>This is my tiny cozy bed.</i>

491
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,083
{\an8}<i>Let the room size not fool you.</i>

492
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,083
{\an8}<i>It is very easy to lose things here.</i>

493
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:44,541
{\an8}<i>I have already misplaced</i>
<i>my glasses and my ID card.</i>

494
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,916
{\an8}<i>This is my...</i>

495
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,125
{\an8}<i>toothbrush and toothpaste.</i>

496
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,541
<i>And...</i>

497
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:57,333
{\an8}<i>these are some things</i>
<i>that I have brought with me.</i>

498
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,333
{\an8}<i>Because they remind me of home.</i>

499
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,291
<i>So, Prahastha?</i>

500
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,250
<i>No complaints, right?</i>

501
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:15,500
<i>Right?</i>

502
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,208
<i>I told you I'm sending</i>
<i>you the best student.</i>

503
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,916
Today was your first day.

504
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:38,916
Did well.

505
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,666
In fact, good job.

506
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:43,833
Thank you.

507
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:02,958
Sir?

508
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,083
You can...

509
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,666
lift any object
in the air, right?

510
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:14,583
Actually...

511
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:19,125
I can lift anything
and throw it anywhere.

512
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:28,125
I used to think this was a
really boring and useless power.

513
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,416
And I had developed a huge complex.

514
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,833
But a vegetable vendor
visited our building one day.

515
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:36,333
In those days, people on higher floors,
would get their vegetables

516
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,416
by throwing a basket and a rope for
the vendor and then pulling it back up.

517
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,833
So, I used my powers...

518
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,541
to send up a
basket of vegetables.

519
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,791
And I became a hero for the
aunties and a superhero for the kids.

520
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,500
Sir, where does our food come from?

521
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,750
The dead bodies that we extract...

522
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:05,791
the whole day.

523
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,375
I'm sorry.
Are you a vegetarian?

524
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,666
I'm really sorry, Ms. Yuvishka.
I was joking.

525
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,333
Please... eat.

526
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:26,291
Our food stock arrives every six
months from the base station.

527
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,708
If you have any food preferences,
let me know, I can talk to Mr. Nitigya.

528
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,583
May I click a picture of the food?

529
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:41,500
Okay.

530
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,333
Ms. Yuvishka, where
did you get this watch?

531
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,958
From the cargo we
extracted this morning.

532
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:03,625
So, you stole it.

533
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:10,041
What do you mean?
We discard it anyway.

534
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,125
One second.

535
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,583
So, what next?

536
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,958
If a rich cargo shows
up with better stuff,

537
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,416
you will treat him
better than a poor cargo,

538
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,416
who will probably
show up empty-handed?

539
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,333
Sir!

540
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,708
This is a very common practice.
It happens on every spaceship.

541
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,333
In fact, they post
"Find of the day" videos.

542
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,833
But this is my spaceship.

543
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:29,333
Here, you have to follow my rules.

544
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,458
The watch that you're
wearing is not your property.

545
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,375
I don't think I need
to spell it out for you.

546
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,875
You should know this.

547
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,416
I wanted to ask you something.

548
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:38,666
Have you been living alone...

549
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:40,666
all these years?

550
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:43,333
We are always alone,
wherever we live.

551
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,458
What I mean is...

552
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,541
am I the first one
to live with you on this ship?

553
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:59,250
Well, a detective was here once.

554
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,500
<i>When I tried to wipe his memory...</i>

555
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,375
<i>I realized that a component in the</i>
<i>machine had malfunctioned.</i>

556
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,250
<i>He lived with me for 20 days!</i>

557
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:14,833
<i>He was really funny!</i>

558
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:15,958
<i>And really curious.</i>

559
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,708
<i>Sometimes, he was just irritating.</i>

560
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,291
<i>I would wonder</i>
<i>when he would leave.</i>

561
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:23,791
<i>One day...</i>

562
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,416
<i>we got the component from the</i>
<i>base station and he...</i>

563
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:31,250
<i>was transitioned.</i>

564
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,041
<i>There's another one.</i>
<i>Something really weird happened.</i>

565
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:38,333
<i>There was this girl who was here</i>
<i>because she had overdosed on drugs.</i>

566
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:42,750
<i>And for some reason, she thought</i>
<i>there was a giant rat sitting next to me.</i>

567
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,708
<i>And as I was taking</i>
<i>her for final extraction,</i>

568
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,291
<i>they revived her and</i>
<i>sent her back to life.</i>

569
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:56,375
<i>Now they tell me she has become</i>
<i>a preacher and has 200 rats.</i>

570
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:06,916
{\an8}<i>This is our very special</i>
<i>machine which is 75 years old.</i>

571
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,958
{\an8}<i>This is Antak-3000.</i>

572
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,791
{\an8}<i>This is our workstation.</i>

573
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,750
{\an8}<i>Every morning we</i>
<i>receive a list of cargos.</i>

574
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:17,208
{\an8}<i>Today's list is already</i>
<i>here which seems pretty long.</i>

575
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:21,541
{\an8}<i>And we get this list from</i>
<i>our very own Mr. Nitigya!</i>

576
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,500
{\an8}<i>-He is a ground control officer.</i>
<i>-Hi! Hi!</i>

577
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,333
{\an8}<i>He tells us what we are--</i>

578
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,833
{\an8}<i>And that, of course, is Mr. Prahastha.</i>

579
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:33,333
{\an8}<i>Sir, your fans, they would</i>
<i>love to hear you say something.</i>

580
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,333
{\an8}<i>Hello! Hello!</i>

581
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:36,958
<i>Okay.</i>

582
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,291
<i>And this is--</i>

583
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,416
What the hell!

584
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:48,000
How many times do I have to tell you
that there are no phones allowed in here?

585
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,500
I was making a
video for my fans.

586
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,500
Fans?

587
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,458
You've been here for one
day and you have fans?

588
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:53,458
<i>Hello, Yuvishka.</i>

589
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:54,541
Hello, Mr. Nitigya!

590
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:58,166
<i>Yesterday, a guy stopped</i>
<i>me on the street and asked me...</i>

591
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,791
<i>"Do you work for IPSO?"</i>

592
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,708
I said, "Yes."

593
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,958
<i>Then he asked me...</i>

594
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,333
<i>if I could leak a video of you two.</i>

595
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:10,416
And what did you say?

596
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,166
<i>I said, "I'll hit you with my shoe!"</i>

597
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,250
Sir!

598
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,791
That's a long list, Mr. Nitigya!

599
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,500
<i>Yeah, today the list is pretty long.</i>

600
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:21,875
Who's coming in today?

601
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,500
Please be careful, sir!

602
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,625
I could've died!

603
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,750
Shit!

604
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,166
Please be careful, sir!

605
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,583
I could've died!

606
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,291
Don't worry, sir.
We are running a little late.

607
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:39,250
We are almost there!
Yes, sir!

608
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,791
We are almost there!

609
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:41,750
Here we are!

610
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,333
<i>I request you to</i>
<i>maintain silence.</i>

611
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:47,541
<i>I request you to</i>
<i>maintain silence.</i>

612
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,708
<i>In an unfortunate bus accident--</i>

613
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:59,833
<i>I welcome you to Pushpak 634A!</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

614
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,541
<i>Please maintain silence!</i>

615
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,166
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Silence, please!</i>

616
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,458
<i>Please maintain silence!</i>

617
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:17,291
Please form a queue.

618
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,500
Please stand here, sir.

619
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,583
Thanks.

620
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,125
Please place your
palms on the screen.

621
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:31,916
Son!

622
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:34,208
What are you doing?

623
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:35,958
Hey!

624
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,250
Where's your mother?

625
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,208
Sir, one minute! Please!
What are you doing?

626
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,875
You're not allowed to take pictures.

627
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:47,500
There's been a mistake.

628
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,041
I am not supposed to be here.

629
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,791
I was just filling in for my friend.

630
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:55,958
I'm sorry, sir.

631
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,666
But you can't click
pictures in here.

632
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,916
Please deposit your
camera outside. Please!

633
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,500
Ma'am, please place
your belongings in the tray.

634
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,125
This was a gift from my mother-in-law.

635
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,791
It's been with my
family for generations.

636
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,541
I told you to not
remove it from the locker!

637
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:13,583
Excuse me, ma'am!

638
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:16,833
My future wife is waiting for me.
Please let me make one phone call.

639
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:18,625
I'm sorry, sir.
That's against the rules.

640
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:19,541
Just one call.

641
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,666
I just want to tell her to marry
someone else and be happy.

642
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,083
The call can help
her rebuild her life.

643
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,083
Please!

644
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,416
Please, ma'am.

645
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:32,083
Don't call her. You can text her.
But please hurry.

646
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,041
Thank you, ma'am.

647
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:34,541
Ma'am, please do it.

648
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,375
Sir, you guys can
take your caps off.

649
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,125
Yes, the camera as well.

650
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:45,708
Sir! You can take him.

651
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,375
-Yes, that's what I am doing.
-Sure.

652
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,750
Please, follow me.

653
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,041
Sir!

654
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,916
Can you please stand there?

655
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,500
How dare she marry someone else,
after I am dead?

656
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:19,750
I texted her...

657
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,833
"If you marry someone else,

658
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,916
I'll haunt your husband
for the rest of his life!

659
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,625
You can't get rid of me."

660
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:26,583
Perfect!

661
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,541
Excuse me, you lied to me?

662
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,500
I mean, it's fair, ma'am.

663
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,166
Justice has to be delivered.

664
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,250
I died because of her wedding.

665
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:37,166
I'm going through this circus and she
gets to live it up with someone else?

666
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:01,291
I was stabbed!

667
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,625
My brother stabbed
me in the back!

668
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:08,875
The kid who used to
climb up on my shoulder...

669
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,750
Sir...
Ms. Yuvishka.

670
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,500
Sir, please stay still.

671
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:17,750
It's over. It's done.

672
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,708
Done.

673
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,291
I raised him like my son.

674
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,583
What did I get?

675
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,708
Are you feeling better now?

676
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:41,833
Yeah.

677
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,125
There is some pain.

678
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,583
Ms. Yuvishka?

679
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:11,500
Is this a hospital?

680
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,958
No, sir. You've died.

681
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:16,833
So, this is heaven?

682
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,708
There is no heaven or hell, sir.

683
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:20,416
Everyone comes here.

684
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:23,541
Will my brother come here?

685
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:24,750
Yes.

686
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:27,166
What's the point?

687
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,583
I did the right thing all my life.

688
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,958
Helped everyone who needed me.

689
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,541
And he conned people.

690
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,000
But I ended up here and so will he.

691
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:43,458
And what about Shadow?

692
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:45,791
My pet Labrador.

693
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:48,250
Who'll look after him?

694
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,291
<i>Ten...</i>

695
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:04,750
<i>nine...</i>

696
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:06,041
<i>eight...</i>

697
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:07,375
<i>seven...</i>

698
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:08,791
<i>six...</i>

699
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,166
<i>five...</i>

700
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:11,625
<i>four...</i>

701
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:12,875
<i>three...</i>

702
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,333
<i>two...</i>

703
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,583
<i>one...</i>

704
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,625
<i>O.</i>

705
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:54,791
Check this out!

706
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,125
You're using a magnet.

707
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,458
<i>No, I'm not!</i>

708
00:47:58,708 --> 00:47:59,583
Yes, you are!

709
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:00,875
Why are you lying?

710
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,583
<i>That's a magic trick as well.</i>

711
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,708
<i>Everyone's got their</i>
<i>powers in school!</i>

712
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:07,333
<i>The teacher told Mom,</i>
<i>"Your son is a little slow."</i>

713
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,333
<i>I had to do something myself.</i>

714
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,833
Tell her, you being slow
is none of her business!

715
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:15,541
Ghatotkach?

716
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,166
Today we had a record
number of transitions.

717
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,791
In fact, I interacted with
some cargos personally.

718
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,291
And I learned something.

719
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:44,583
I learned that all cargos have
their own stories back on Earth.

720
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:46,666
Just like I have my own story.

721
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,000
But when the cargos die...

722
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:53,541
does it mean that
their stories end?

723
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,583
And if they do...

724
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:59,750
what's the point?

725
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,416
There is no point to anything.

726
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,375
A meteor shower is approaching
our ship in the next six hours.

727
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:11,750
Wait a second.
We don't have to do much.

728
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:14,708
Just go to sleep.

729
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,250
{\an8}<i>The storm is expected to hit the</i>
<i>extraction bay in the next eight hours.</i>

730
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:40,625
{\an8}<i>We don't have the exact calculations</i>
<i>about its velocity but its parent comet--</i>

731
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:44,166
<i>Oh baby, for me,</i>
<i>You are the moon</i>

732
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,458
<i>But I am your sunny sunny afternoon</i>

733
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:49,916
Ms. Yuvishka!

734
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:54,125
Either turn it off or
lower the volume!

735
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:57,625
<i>Now our hearts</i>
<i>Will never ever come together</i>

736
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,875
<i>As you refuse to come</i>
<i>And meet me here</i>

737
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,125
Ms. Yuvishka!

738
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:06,166
<i>My unwritten letters still cannot fathom</i>

739
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,958
<i>I'm told you guys did a record</i>
<i>number of transitions today?</i>

740
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:15,166
<i>Are you prepared for the storm?</i>

741
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:17,375
Do we have an option?

742
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:20,291
<i>Anyway, you're all</i>
<i>over today's news.</i>

743
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:21,333
What?

744
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:24,916
People saw you
today after many years.

745
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:26,375
Okay.

746
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,666
Which paper are
you talking about?

747
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:28,875
Mr. Chaitanya!

748
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,791
<i>Oh baby, for me, you are the moon</i>

749
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:58,583
<i>But I am your sunny sunny afternoon</i>

750
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:01,750
<i>How should we find a place to meet</i>

751
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:05,125
<i>When I am here and you there</i>

752
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:09,250
<i>Promise me that</i>
<i>You will never let me go</i>

753
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,000
<i>Promise! Promise!</i>

754
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:12,416
<i>Yes, I Promise!</i>

755
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,958
<i>This is the love you should know</i>

756
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:21,041
<i>I'm your forget me not</i>

757
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,916
<i>I'm always in your thoughts</i>

758
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,708

786
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:22,250
<i>Oh, baby why?</i>

787
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:25,791
<i>Oh, baby why?</i>

788
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:28,916

Mr. Prahastha?

794
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,083
Sir?

795
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:13,500
Mr.--

796
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:15,708
Mr. Ankur Sareen.

797
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:18,750
You have died because of a
severe head injury.

798
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:22,000
I welcome you to Pushpak 634A.

799
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:25,583
I'm Yuvishka and I am here to help you.

800
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:26,833
Please...

801
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,416
follow me.

802
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:41,666
Take off your mask, sir.

803
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,208
Sir, please follow me.

804
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,500
Sir, I'll just be back.

805
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:34,791
Mr. Prahastha?

806
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
<i>Where are you?</i>

807
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,708
Mr. Prahastha?

808
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,250
Mr. Prahastha, can you hear me?

809
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:04,791
Sir?

810
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,708
Sir, please follow me to
the healing station.

811
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:10,625
Please.

812
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,083
Sir?

813
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:28,208
Sir, please co-operate with us
and come to the healing area.

814
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,125
Please.

815
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,625
Sir, we're not going to hurt you!
We want to help you!

816
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,333
Sir! I can help him!

817
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:40,416
No, Ms. Yuvishka.
You need to leave.

818
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:42,375
It's not safe.

819
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:44,000
I can't risk it.
I'll handle this.

820
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:42,833
Hello, sir?
Can you hear me?

821
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,000
<i>Thank God!</i>
<i>You guys are operational.</i>

822
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:47,875
Sir, please cancel all
our cargos for the day.

823
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:50,333
-<i>No, we can't do that.</i>
-Sir!

824
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,583
Sir, please, we just
had an incident here.

825
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:54,666
We had to transition the
cargo without healing him.

826
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,125
<i>-Prahastha, it's a directed cargo.</i>
-Please!

827
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,291
<i>Please, take it.</i>

828
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,250
<i>Come on.</i>

829
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,333
<i>Okay, ready, ready!</i>

830
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,375
<i>Ready. Stand by.</i>

831
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:02,750
<i>Countdown start.</i>

832
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:03,666
<i>Ten...</i>

833
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:04,791
<i>nine...</i>

834
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:06,166
<i>eight...</i>

835
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,333
<i>seven...</i>

836
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:08,541
<i>six...</i>

837
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:09,708
<i>five...</i>

838
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:10,916
<i>four...</i>

839
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,875
<i>three...</i>

840
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:12,875
<i>two...</i>

841
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,041
<i>one...</i>

842
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:15,041
<i>O.</i>

843
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,458
<i>Extract this cargo</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

844
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:06,000
<i>There could be another storm.</i>

845
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,666
<i>Be fast!</i>

846
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:19,541
<i>If the power fluctuates,</i>
<i>you won't be able to extract him.</i>

847
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,708
<i>Yuvishka can you please hurry.</i>

848
00:58:25,791 --> 00:58:27,583
Okay, Yuvishka.
Come on. Give your best.

849
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:29,791
Come on!

850
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,583
I'm sorry, sir.

851
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:54,875
I don't think I can
heal anyone anymore.

852
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:00,333
<i>Another storm approaching.</i>

853
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:02,000
<i>Starting code red.</i>

854
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:31,291
<i>Today is the fiftieth anniversary of</i>
<i>the Rakshas Manushya Peace Treaty.</i>

855
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:33,666
<i>And as you can see,</i>
<i>there are celebrations...</i>

856
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,541
<i>all over the town.</i>

857
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:38,125
<i>Here you can see</i>
<i>the historic footage</i>

858
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,458
<i>of the Prime Minister</i>
<i>signing the peace treaty.</i>

859
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:46,166
<i>This is the live</i>
<i>broadcast of the parade.</i>

860
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,250
<i>And as we are</i>
<i>celebrating down here,</i>

861
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:51,500
<i>we regretfully inform you that</i>

862
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,583
<i>because an</i>
<i>unexpected meteor storm</i>

863
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:55,958
<i>many spaceships</i>
<i>have suffered serious damage.</i>

864
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,833
<i>Here are some</i>
<i>visuals from the scene.</i>

865
00:59:57,958 --> 00:59:59,041
{\an8}<i>But please don't worry.</i>

866
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:02,375
{\an8}<i>Our ground control officers</i>
<i>are in touch with the spaceships</i>

867
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:06,333
<i>and our support team is helping them</i>
<i>resolve any issues that might occur.</i>

868
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:25,958
<i>The reports are alright.</i>

869
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:30,750
<i>I checked the video feed.</i>

870
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,916
<i>That was an aggressive cargo.</i>

871
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,583
Really, Mr. Nitigya?

872
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,833
Was there nothing
in him worth saving?

873
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:43,250
Was there no way we
could have helped him?

874
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,416
We are going into
low-power mode.

875
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:05,958
You should get some rest.

876
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,166
<i>Okay.</i>

877
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,083
Mr. Nitigya!

878
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,166
What do you think?

879
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,041
<i>Only Mr. Raman can help us.</i>

880
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:34,208
<i>I was just reading this</i>
<i>article on the internet.</i>

881
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:35,583
<i>Read this.</i>

882
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:38,208
<i>It says...</i>

883
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:43,666
<i>"In most cases, when a</i>
<i>healer-demon loses his power...</i>

884
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:47,166
<i>the loss is most likely permanent.</i>

885
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,666
<i>And additionally,</i>
<i>if they lose their power</i>

886
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:55,458
<i>they could be prone to diseases</i>
<i>like yellow fever and plague.</i>

887
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:56,875
Sir, that's nonsense.

888
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:58,750
You must be reading
this on a fraud website.

889
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,083
<i>It's all here.</i>

890
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,083
Alright, we are going into
low-power mode right now.

891
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,250
<i>I'm told things</i>
<i>went south today.</i>

892
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,958
<i>Is your hand alright?</i>

893
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:57,000
<i>And Ms. Yuvishka?</i>

894
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:13,333
<i>Those who are trapped</i>
<i>have been advised to return.</i>

895
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:17,083
<i>The Prime Minister</i>
<i>offered his condolences</i>

896
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:20,958
<i>to the families affected</i>
<i>by the loss of 622XG.</i>

897
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,000
I think we overused
your power yesterday.

898
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,916
That could be the
reason for your fatigue.

899
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:50,833
I think you should take the day off.

900
01:03:58,416 --> 01:03:59,375
By the way...

901
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:02,083
I have temporarily fixed
this healing machine.

902
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:04,541
We can use it for a few days.

903
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:08,250
I thought these healing
machines were banned.

904
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,833
What?

905
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:11,875
Yes.

906
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,291
Many years ago.

907
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:16,791
I was a part of the protest march.

908
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:20,500
My mother is a doctor,
so she was invited to the panel.

909
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:23,916
I remember the slogans as well.

910
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:26,125
"No more machine-doctors!"

911
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:27,958
"No more machine-doctors!"

912
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,166
Really?

913
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,708
No one ever told me about this.

914
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,000
Everyone knows this down there.

915
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,708
We had collected and...

916
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,916
burnt all the
machines in my village.

917
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:44,083
I am sure you were
part of that as well, right?

918
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,708
How did you go from
shouting slogans in your village

919
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:54,375
to being an astronaut up here?

920
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:03,333
That's a long story.

921
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,083
Want to hear it?

922
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,833
Sure.

923
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:10,791
Every year on my birthday

924
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:13,333
we used to go to the
annual Demon Carnival.

925
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:17,291
And I used to rush to my favorite ride.

926
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,541
It used to be the biggest
ride at the carnival.

927
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,125
One day, I looked
back and I realized that...

928
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:25,416
no one really cared about me.

929
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:28,833
I thought...

930
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,791
what if they forget me?

931
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:33,500
They will forget how I look.

932
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:35,458
They'll forget my nose.

933
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:36,958
They'll forget my eyes.

934
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,916
They'll forget my laugh.

935
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,666
They'll forget my hands, my feet.

936
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:42,583
And then...

937
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,458
they'll forget that I ever existed.

938
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:46,125
But then...

939
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:49,041
Pushpak series was
launched in the sky.

940
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:51,750
The whole carnival was silent.

941
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:55,041
They were all looking at the
sky with their mouths wide open.

942
01:05:56,416 --> 01:06:01,333
Five spacecrafts flying away and
a huge cloud of smoke behind them.

943
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:04,791
I can never forget it.

944
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:11,583
Then I realized that if I wasn't down
here but up there in a spacecraft,

945
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,708
I would never get lost.

946
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:17,583
And they would never forget me.

947
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:27,250
Good morning, Mr. Nitigya!

948
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:28,875
<i>Yes, good morning.</i>

949
01:06:29,166 --> 01:06:30,500
It's dark out here.

950
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:33,458
<i>I was supposed to take</i>
<i>a family vacation today.</i>

951
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,208
<i>Chaitanya had signed it off as well.</i>

952
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:37,625
<i>I had to cancel it!</i>

953
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,250
<i>Five spaceships are untraceable.</i>

954
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,166
Everything is a mess here as well.

955
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:46,416
When I started...

956
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:48,541
I didn't have this competition.

957
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:51,708
Life was easier.

958
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,125
People were happier.

959
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,750
I was a pilot in the
air force back then.

960
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:02,750
I thought, if I can fly a plane,
I can fly a spaceship as well.

961
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:04,583
That's it.

962
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,083
I came up here and
I became a hero.

963
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:09,916
<i>Prahastha!</i>

964
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,375
<i>Mr. Prahastha!</i>

965
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,458
<i>Nitigya, please clear the line.</i>

966
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:14,916
<i>I need to have a word with you.</i>

967
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Hello, Mr. Raman.

968
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,333
Let's go to the cockpit,
we'll talk there.

969
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:19,416
Just give me a minute, please.

970
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:29,041
Mr. Nitigya!

971
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:30,708
What are your powers?

972
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:33,166
<i>I can disappear.</i>

973
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,291
What?

974
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:36,750
<i>Not completely.</i>

975
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,791
<i>But... 86,75 percent.</i>

976
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:41,500
What do you mean?

977
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:43,291
<i>You want to see?</i>

978
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:47,000
<i>See.</i>

979
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,750
I can still see you, sir.

980
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:56,875
<i>It's impossible to disappear</i>
<i>completely, ma'am.</i>

981
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,958
<i>So, 634A.</i>

982
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,375
<i>There is something</i>
<i>wrong with every ship.</i>

983
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:04,333
<i>I didn't go home last night.</i>

984
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,750
<i>I have read all the reports.</i>

985
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:07,666
Okay.

986
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,083
<i>The weather is not conducive...</i>

987
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:10,416
<i>and there's plenty of backlog.</i>

988
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:12,541
<i>We'll recall her when</i>
<i>the weather improves.</i>

989
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:16,375
Sorry, sir, but,
who are you gonna recall?

990
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,416
<i>Yuvishka, of course.</i>

991
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:19,958
<i>I saw her report,</i>
<i>she is not well.</i>

992
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:22,500
<i>We'll call her back as soon</i>
<i>as the weather improves.</i>

993
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:23,583
What?

994
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,416
How could you even consider that, sir?

995
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,083
<i>Don't worry, Prahastha.</i>

996
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:31,416
<i>We'll immediately send</i>
<i>you a replacement.</i>

997
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:33,125
<i>There is this new boy.</i>

998
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:34,625
<i>Interview him tomorrow.</i>

999
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:36,666
No, sir. I will not be
interviewing anyone.

1000
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:39,166
Because no one will
be leaving this ship.

1001
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,750
<i>Oh, God!</i>
<i>Prahastha, please!</i>

1002
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:45,875
<i>Okay.</i>

1003
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:49,041
<i>Traveling isn't an option anyway.</i>

1004
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,000
<i>There are meteor</i>
<i>showers and there's dust.</i>

1005
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,916
<i>No ship can</i>
<i>take off right now.</i>

1006
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:54,625
<i>We have 48 hours.</i>

1007
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:57,250
<i>Observe her for the next 48 hours.</i>

1008
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,041
<i>If she improves...</i>

1009
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:00,708
<i>I won't call her back.</i>

1010
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:03,250
<i>Otherwise, she'll have to come back.</i>

1011
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:05,208
<i>Is that okay?</i>

1012
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:08,958
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

1013
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:14,291
<i>The meteor shower has affected</i>
<i>the frequency of transmissions.</i>

1014
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:17,333
<i>Pushpak 622XG has</i>
<i>suffered serious damage.</i>

1015
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:19,000
<i>It has been recalled.</i>

1016
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:22,166
<i>80 percent ships are expected</i>
<i>to resume work tomorrow.</i>

1017
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,666
<i>According to our sources,</i>

1018
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:27,125
<i>Ms. Yuvishka, who was a new</i>
<i>addition to the Pushpak 634A crew</i>

1019
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:28,833
<i>will be returning to Earth.</i>

1020
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:34,291
<i>Our reporters are waiting for the official</i>
<i>confirmation from the PDTS headquarters.</i>

1021
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:35,250
<i>Hello?</i>

1022
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:36,875
-Yes, Mom?
<i>-Hello, sweetie!</i>

1023
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,250
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

1024
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,208
<i>Quit the job, pack your</i>
<i>stuff and come home.</i>

1025
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:42,750
<i>They don't deserve you.</i>

1026
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,000
You know I can't do it.

1027
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:45,875
<i>Of course, you can!</i>

1028
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:48,708
<i>Is this how they treat a topper?</i>

1029
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:51,791
<i>Your father was furious, he wants</i>
<i>to burn their headquarters down.</i>

1030
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:55,583
<i>Mr. Prahastha can come</i>
<i>here and extract his buddies!</i>

1031
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,583
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

1032
01:09:57,666 --> 01:10:00,000
<i>I'll get you a job right</i>
<i>here at the hospital.</i>

1033
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,208
<i>You can work here with me.</i>

1034
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:03,250
<i>You're listening, right?</i>

1035
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,166
Sure.

1036
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,958
<i>Please come as soon as you can!</i>

1037
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:07,333
I will come home.

1038
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:11,916
<i>And the spaceships that are</i>
<i>expected to resume their work are...</i>

1039
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,166
<i>745F...</i>

1040
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:14,708

<i>O.</i>

1077
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,083
I was crossing the
road and I looked left.

1078
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,791
It was a one-way street.

1079
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,666
And he came from the right side.

1080
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:09,041
He's okay, right?

1081
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:10,750
He is a young lad.

1082
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,916
I have seen him around.

1083
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:28,666
Hello?

1084
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,291
<i>Hello, ma'am.</i>
<i>This is Meena from Demon Tribune.</i>

1085
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:31,458
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>

1086
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:33,250
No, I don't want
to talk right now.

1087
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:36,083
<i>Can you confirm the</i>
<i>news we have heard?</i>

1088
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:38,458
I'll let you know as soon
as I get any information.

1089
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:40,416
<i>Okay, as soon as you</i>
<i>find out, please let us know.</i>

1090
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,333
Yes.

1091
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:01,166
Sir?

1092
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:02,916
I have a small request.

1093
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:04,250
Please.

1094
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,291
Can I make one phone call?

1095
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,625
Sorry, sir.
That's against the rules.

1096
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:12,333
Okay. No problem.

1097
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:19,416
Alright, do it.

1098
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:21,333
Sorry?

1099
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:23,583
You can make the call.

1100
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:42,458
I am okay.

1101
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:43,416
I am fine.

1102
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:44,875
You're okay?

1103
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:46,666
Yes, of course.

1104
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:47,958
I'll be coming!

1105
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:49,625
Yes.

1106
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,416
Everything will be okay.

1107
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Okay. Okay.

1108
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:05,708
I know you.

1109
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:08,041
Sorry?

1110
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:10,416
You are our building plumber, right?

1111
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:13,791
But I always knew you
had this secret identity.

1112
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:30,916
-Hello, Mr. Nitigya?
<i>-Yeah?</i>

1113
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:34,583
Can you please send me the
photographs of my first ten cargos?

1114
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:35,500
<i>Why?</i>

1115
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:38,291
I need to check something.
I'll tell you later.

1116
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,541
<i>Okay.</i>

1117
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:41,708
<i>Give me some time.</i>

1118
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,375
Yeah, no problem.
Thank you.

1119
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:56,541
It's him.
He was here right now.

1120
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:00,291
<i>Your cargos have started</i>
<i>repeating, Prahastha.</i>

1121
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:04,208
<i>You've spent many years up there.</i>

1122
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,416
I was thinking the same.

1123
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:11,500
<i>I had received a mail alert.</i>

1124
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,791
<i>It's time for you to retire, Prahastha.</i>

1125
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:19,166
<i>An entire era has passed on Earth.</i>

1126
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,708
I finally get why you wanted
me to have an assistant

1127
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:25,458
and why Yuvishka was sent here.

1128
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:27,833
<i>What could we do?</i>

1129
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:30,666
<i>We needed a backup.</i>

1130
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,958
<i>The other five astronauts</i>
<i>are retiring as well.</i>

1131
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,291
<i>Their cargos had started</i>
<i>repeating years ago.</i>

1132
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,291
What now?

1133
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:44,291
<i>We have an assistant on standby.</i>

1134
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:45,750
<i>Interview him.</i>

1135
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,041
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

1136
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:50,166
<i>Okay?</i>

1137
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,000
<i>I'm dialing.</i>

1138
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:39,250
<i>She has been tolerating you!</i>

1139
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:43,458
<i>Look at this man, he doesn't look</i>
<i>a day over 50 and he's 638 years old.</i>

1140
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,875
<i>You have to find</i>
<i>your own strength.</i>

1141
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:46,916
<i>Like I said--</i>

1142
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,416
There was a man here today.

1143
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:52,000
He was simple and kind.

1144
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:56,458
He was really
worried about his wife.

1145
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,875
So, I extracted his dead
body and I made this cake.

1146
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,458
Okay, bad joke.
I'm sorry.

1147
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:13,000
Have you heard about the
<i>Ramchandra Negi Show?</i>

1148
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:13,958
What?

1149
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:16,708
Ramchandra Negi.

1150
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:18,958
He's the International
Loneliness Detective

1151
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,750
What detective?

1152
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:25,541
"Has someone stabbed you in the back?

1153
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:29,708
Have you been betrayed?

1154
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,333
Are you lonely?

1155
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:36,166
Is your life's train stuck
at Loneliness Station?

1156
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:43,750
Call 1800 Ramchandra Negi,
your loneliness detective."

1157
01:17:45,416 --> 01:17:46,250
Okay.

1158
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,416
I'll think about it.

1159
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,291
"I will come to your house.

1160
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:50,750
I will share your food...

1161
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,291
and your water.

1162
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,916
I'll share your bed

1163
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,125
and I'll cure your loneliness."

1164
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,291
Mr. Prahastha, can you tell me...

1165
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:03,416
what do you do every day, all alone?

1166
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:05,958
I...

1167
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:08,250
I wait here...

1168
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:11,666
and the humans who die on earth...

1169
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:13,958
they come up here.

1170
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,958
First, I heal them.

1171
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:17,875
Then, I erase their memories.

1172
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:19,791
And finally, we go for transition.

1173
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:21,083
Where?

1174
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:22,250
Here.

1175
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:28,666
I have to admit, Mr. Prahastha,
you have quite an interesting job.

1176
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:32,458
But...

1177
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,125
what is this?

1178
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:35,625
What?

1179
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,875
Letter to Mandakini.

1180
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:47,708
-A letter in the age of video calling.
-Ms. Yuvishka--

1181
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:49,500
-Mr. Chaitanya, please call her!
-Yuvishka-- No! No!

1182
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:50,791
Chaitanya, don't call her.
Please!

1183
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:52,375
Please return my letter.

1184
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:54,250
Please, this is not funny!

1185
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:55,708
This is my personal stuff.

1186
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,666
What...

1187
01:18:58,750 --> 01:18:59,708
What are you guys doing?

1188
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:00,750
This isn't funny!

1189
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:01,958
Have you lost it?

1190
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:34,333
<i>Hello?</i>

1191
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:36,541
<i>Hello?</i>

1192
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:39,458
Hello.

1193
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:42,750
<i>Hello, I got a</i>
<i>call from this number.</i>

1194
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:45,541
<i>Sorry, I can't see anything.</i>

1195
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:46,833
Okay, just...

1196
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,041
just one second.

1197
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:53,583
Hey!

1198
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:01,541
<i>Prahastha!</i>

1199
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,416
<i>How are you?</i>

1200
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,333
Well...

1201
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,958
all good.

1202
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:16,916
<i>Good, good.</i>

1203
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:19,208
<i>Ma'am, I have cleaned the tank.</i>

1204
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,333
<i>Yeah, wait for five minutes.</i>
<i>I'll pay you.</i>

1205
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:23,958
<i>Ma'am, I need to leave.</i>

1206
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:27,708
<i>I'll just be back in a second.</i>

1207
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,750
<i>These guys are really impatient.</i>

1208
01:20:49,541 --> 01:20:50,541
So...

1209
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,041
<i>So?</i>

1210
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:57,291
Just...

1211
01:20:57,375 --> 01:20:58,250
all well.

1212
01:20:58,750 --> 01:20:59,750
What about you?

1213
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:02,958
How many kids do you have?

1214
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:04,375
<i>Two.</i>

1215
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:05,708
Two?

1216
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:07,125
<i>Yeah.</i>

1217
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:09,208
Wow!

1218
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:10,333
Congratulations.

1219
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,125
<i>Thanks.</i>

1220
01:21:12,791 --> 01:21:14,500
I've have started my
own college as well.

1221
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:17,041
You started an entire
college just for two kids?

1222
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,250
You're great!

1223
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:20,583
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Prahastha!

1224
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,791
We just finished the finals.

1225
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:25,708
Actually, Yuvishka was my student.

1226
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:30,958
Okay, I...

1227
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:32,958
-I didn't know that.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

1228
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:34,875
Nobody told me.

1229
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:36,750
Yuvishka never told me either.

1230
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:38,291
<i>Okay.</i>

1231
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:39,541
<i>So, why did you call?</i>

1232
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:43,500
Actually, I didn't.
Yuvishka called you.

1233
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:57,500
<i>Alright.</i>

1234
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,375
<i>I guess, I will hang up.</i>

1235
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:04,791
<i>Okay.</i>

1236
01:22:09,916 --> 01:22:10,750
Bye.

1237
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,750
<i>Was it Yuvishka again?</i>

1238
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:44,875
Mandakini, please.

1239
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:48,666
<i>Did you remember me?</i>

1240
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:51,000
<i>Or did you just forget?</i>

1241
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:54,750
What do you think?

1242
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:57,500
<i>But you never felt like</i>
<i>you should call me?</i>

1243
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:00,875
<i>Ask me how I was?</i>

1244
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:07,666
<i>I thought you didn't</i>
<i>need me anymore.</i>

1245
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:11,166
<i>You just cut yourself</i>
<i>off from everyone.</i>

1246
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,125
<i>All these years.</i>

1247
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:16,666
<i>I feel like...</i>

1248
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:20,541
<i>I am talking to a ghost.</i>

1249
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:28,291
Sometimes, I feel the same.

1250
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:31,541
I feel that the people who come here
are alive and I am just a ghost.

1251
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:35,166
<i>Prahastha...</i>

1252
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:41,291
I wrote to you.

1253
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:43,625
<i>I didn't get any letter.</i>

1254
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:48,166
Because I never sent any.

1255
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:56,458
I wrote many letters,
but I never sent any.

1256
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:25,291
I'm sorry.

1257
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:58,125
I have started packing my stuff.

1258
01:25:01,875 --> 01:25:03,625
I'll leave tomorrow.

1259
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:06,625
<i>After I leave...</i>

1260
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:10,000
<i>you will miss me for a few days.</i>

1261
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:12,416
<i>But...</i>

1262
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:14,708
<i>gradually, you will forget me.</i>

1263
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:20,625
<i>Maybe...</i>

1264
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,791
<i>after some time...</i>

1265
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,458
<i>you might miss me again.</i>

1266
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:25,750
<i>But then...</i>

1267
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,250
<i>you will forget me once again.</i>

1268
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:33,708
Or it's possible that
you might get better.

1269
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:38,041
And just stay here.

1270
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:04,458
Look!

1271
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,500
A Pushpak is heading home.

1272
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:58,000
<i>Finally, the meteor dust has settled</i>
<i>and all the spaceships are operational.</i>

1273
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:02,125
<i>All agents on standby are</i>
<i>requested to resume their travel.</i>

1274
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:03,416
<i>Good morning, Prahastha!</i>

1275
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:06,083
<i>We will touchdown in 30 minutes.</i>

1276
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,416
<i>A special announcement</i>
<i>for all the agents.</i>

1277
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:10,791
<i>If your cargos have</i>
<i>started recognizing you,</i>

1278
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:13,750
<i>it means that they have already</i>
<i>passed through your spaceship once.</i>

1279
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,916
<i>If the count of such</i>
<i>cargos rises above ten,</i>

1280
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,416
<i>please contact your ground officer to</i>
<i>initiate retirement proceedings.</i>

1281
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,666
<i>In other news,</i>

1282
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:26,625
<i>pop singer Shurpanakha launched</i>
<i>a new music video for her hit single.</i>

1283
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:30,583
<i>Pushpak 622XG has</i>
<i>returned to the launching bay</i>

1284
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:33,083
<i>and its recycling</i>

1285
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:42,083
<i>Good morning, Ms. Yuvishka!</i>

1286
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,625
<i>I hope you are up and ready.</i>

1287
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:46,583
You've had enough time off.
It's time to get back to work.

1288
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,458
And...

1289
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:53,333
there won't be any media
access in the spaceship for the day.

1290
01:27:56,958 --> 01:27:58,166
<i>I hope that's clear.</i>

1291
01:27:58,458 --> 01:27:59,458
Okay, sir!

1292
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:03,166
<i>By that I mean,</i>
<i>phone calls as well.</i>

1293
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:05,083
<i>Is that clear?</i>

1294
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:11,291
Yes, Mom.

1295
01:28:12,708 --> 01:28:13,958
Yeah, I'm packing.

1296
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:31,208
<i>Countdown start.</i>

1297
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:32,458
<i>Ten...</i>

1298
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:33,958
<i>nine...</i>

1299
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:35,666
<i>eight...</i>

1300
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:36,958
<i>seven...</i>

1301
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:38,166
<i>five...</i>

1302
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,291
<i>four--</i>

1303
01:28:39,583 --> 01:28:41,666
{\an8}Sorry... let's do it again.

1304
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:44,666
{\an8}<i>Hello, friends!</i>

1305
01:28:44,833 --> 01:28:46,083
{\an8}<i>I am Chetan Kanodia.</i>

1306
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:47,708
{\an8}<i>And this is my time machine.</i>

1307
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:51,291
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>I will be traveling through time.</i>

1308
01:28:51,666 --> 01:28:53,208
<i>As soon as I press this button,</i>

1309
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:56,583
<i>a space-time hole will be</i>
<i>created around my body</i>

1310
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:58,916
<i>and I will travel through time.</i>

1311
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,250
Hey, Chetan!

1312
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:05,333
Did you get your
toothbrush instead of a pen?

1313
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:06,583
<i>Eight...</i>

1314
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:07,833
<i>seven...</i>

1315
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:09,041
<i>six...</i>

1316
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:10,375
<i>five...</i>

1317
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:11,625
<i>four...</i>

1318
01:29:11,875 --> 01:29:12,875
<i>three...</i>

1319
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,083
<i>two...</i>

1320
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,250
<i>one...</i>

1321
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:21,833
My machine worked!

1322
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:23,541
It's working!

1323
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:24,541
Excuse me?

1324
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:26,583
Where am I?

1325
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,333
Is this the past or the future?

1326
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:33,416
Mr. Chetan Kanodia,
I welcome you to Pushpak 634A.

1327
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:36,041
Now, I'll successfully
send you to a safe place.

1328
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:40,750
The date and time are the same.

1329
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,833
Is this a parallel universe?

1330
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Mr. Kanodia, I'm afraid you
have died due to an electric shock.

1331
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,458
What--

1332
01:29:50,416 --> 01:29:52,750
I am Prahastha and I'll initiate
your post-death transition.

1333
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:54,125
So, please, follow me.

1334
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:09,500
Ms. Yuvishka.

1335
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:12,541
Can you please try and heal him?

1336
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:20,791
I'll get the healing machine.

1337
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:27,541
So, where am I?

1338
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:29,958
Is this an aircraft?

1339
01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:31,041
Yes.

1340
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:32,375
It's a spaceship.

1341
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:38,291
One of my friends
had studied this.

1342
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,208
He posited that when you die...

1343
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:43,958
a spaceship sucks you up.

1344
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,291
And then puts you
back on the ground.

1345
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:51,000
So, am I gonna go back home?

1346
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:53,250
Yes.

1347
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:54,875
To the same world?

1348
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,666
You want to go back
to the same world?

1349
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,166
Yes, of course.
I want to go back.

1350
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,333
Make the time machine.

1351
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:08,166
That's the reason I never had a family.

1352
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:09,541
And ironically...

1353
01:31:09,916 --> 01:31:12,333
that's the reason I
lost my life as well.

1354
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:15,125
You want to go back
and do the same thing?

1355
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:16,208
Yes, of course!

1356
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:17,750
Of course!

1357
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:19,041
Of course!

1358
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,958
Total ten and he's the eleventh.

1359
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,208
<i>Let's focus on Yuvishka for now.</i>

1360
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:48,375
<i>Hello, Prahastha!</i>

1361
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:50,291
<i>What's the status on Yuvishka.</i>

1362
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:52,625
<i>Any signs of improvement?</i>

1363
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:54,041
Hello, sir.

1364
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:55,666
<i>Hello, Yuvishka!</i>

1365
01:32:07,291 --> 01:32:08,708
<i>I have to attend a meeting.</i>

1366
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:11,083
<i>We can have a</i>
<i>test when I get back.</i>

1367
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:12,708
Test?

1368
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:14,916
<i>Yes, the next cargo that comes in...</i>

1369
01:32:15,375 --> 01:32:17,416
<i>you have to cure him.</i>

1370
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,125
<i>If it goes well, great!</i>

1371
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,666
<i>If not, we'll have to see.</i>

1372
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:23,875
<i>I'll see you guys after the meeting.</i>

1373
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,333
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

1374
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,125
<i>There's another cargo inbound.</i>

1375
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:29,250
<i>It's a joint suicide case.</i>

1376
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:32,375
<i>Wife got cancer, so they</i>
<i>committed suicide to be together.</i>

1377
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:54,791
Please come in, sir.

1378
01:32:57,416 --> 01:33:00,291
Don't worry.
I will find you.

1379
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:24,791
I don't want to take the test.

1380
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,291
I want to show you something.

1381
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:34,208
Yuvishka, hurry!

1382
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:39,541
Look.

1383
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:43,166
He is the one who just left.

1384
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,416
And this is his wife.

1385
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:08,250
They'll always find each other.

1386
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:19,333
People think that when they come here,
they have lost everything.

1387
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:23,083
But the truth is...

1388
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:27,833
nothing is truly lost forever.

1389
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:33,958
There is always something,
somewhere that survives.

1390
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:36,916
Always.

1391
01:34:47,416 --> 01:34:48,625
Yes, Ghatotkach?

1392
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:49,708
<i>Look at me!</i>

1393
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:51,166
What?

1394
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:54,875
<i>I think I am finally</i>
<i>getting my powers.</i>

1395
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:01,458
Ms. Yuvishka, the
next cargo is on its way.

1396
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:03,041
Are you ready for the test?

1397
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:20,708
Food!

1398
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:21,750
Water!

1399
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:23,000
Air and Land!

1400
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,916
These were all free for everyone!

1401
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:27,875
But for these things,
we now need to sell our souls.

1402
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:30,041
I won't take up some dumb job.

1403
01:35:30,666 --> 01:35:32,125
What will you do?

1404
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:34,375
I will do a show.

1405
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:35,708
My own show!

1406
01:35:57,416 --> 01:35:58,750
What's up, Mr. Negi?

1407
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,416
You've stopped posting videos.

1408
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:03,250
Do you have any new
episodes coming up?

1409
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:05,041
I do it sometimes.

1410
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:06,666
But the family
is more important, right?

1411
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:07,916
That's true.

1412
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:09,416
I'm on my way back.

1413
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:11,708
Okay.

1414
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,500
How's your dad doing?

1415
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:19,875
He passed away.

1416
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:21,125
What?

1417
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:22,666
He was a big fan!

1418
01:36:23,416 --> 01:36:26,750
He used to say that because of
your talent, people have realized...

1419
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:29,333
that they are living their
lives as if they're already dead.

1420
01:37:23,166 --> 01:37:24,041
Okay...

1421
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:25,416
no problem.

1422
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:28,000
We can try it again
with the next cargo.

1423
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:31,666
I will just use this...

1424
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:50,708
I-- I'll...

1425
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:52,541
I'll just be back.

1426
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:53,916
Okay?

1427
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:41,416
<i>Prahastha...</i>

1428
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:44,000
<i>I've read your report.</i>

1429
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,000
<i>There have been 13 repeats.</i>

1430
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:48,625
<i>We have to</i>
<i>compulsorily retire you.</i>

1431
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:49,708
Yes, sir.

1432
01:38:49,916 --> 01:38:51,041
<i>Once you get back...</i>

1433
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:54,625
<i>you will spend a year in rehab.</i>

1434
01:38:54,916 --> 01:38:56,416
<i>You've been away for many years.</i>

1435
01:38:57,833 --> 01:39:00,458
<i>You really need to</i>
<i>adjust back to life here.</i>

1436
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:04,625
<i>Will you tell Yuvishka or should I?</i>

1437
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:07,875
Tell her after I leave.

1438
01:39:13,083 --> 01:39:14,208
<i>All these years...</i>

1439
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:17,958
<i>I have only seen</i>
<i>you through this screen.</i>

1440
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:20,791
<i>Tomorrow, we'll finally meet!</i>

1441
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:22,416
Mr. Nitigya...

1442
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:28,208
thank you for everything.

1443
01:39:29,208 --> 01:39:30,208
See you soon.

1444
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:14,208
Discarding waste.

1445
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:31,666
Good job, Ms. Yuvishka.

1446
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:35,583
Thank you.

1447
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:56,750
<i>When I am here and you there</i>

1448
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:57,708
<i>Prahastha, ready?</i>

1449
01:40:57,791 --> 01:41:01,166
<i>Promise me,</i>
<i>That you'll never let me go</i>

1450
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:02,500
<i>Promise! Promise!</i>

1451
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:04,333
<i>Yes, I promise!</i>

1452
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:08,958
<i>You've lived here all these years,</i>
<i>and yet, you don't have any luggage?</i>

1453
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:12,833
<i>I'm your forget me not</i>

<i>Many demons met the prime minister</i>

01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:37,000
<i>Cameras weren't allowed but</i>

Mr. Nitigya?

01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,833
Haven't you met him?

1510
01:43:53,166 --> 01:43:54,291
<i>I'll meet him in the evening.</i>

1511
01:43:55,708 --> 01:43:57,916
<i>I've been allotted the 04:00 p.m. slot.</i>

1512
01:43:58,333 --> 01:44:00,916
<i>The ministers and important</i>

<i>How are you?</i>

1517
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,250
Hello, I'm good.

1518
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:44,708
