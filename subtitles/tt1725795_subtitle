1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,080
Kung Fu is the principal
Martial Art form

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
China is the most ardent of countries
in propagating this art.

3
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,840
These are schools that
train in Martial Arts

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,800
The chief of all these schools is

5
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,520
The Shaolin Temple

6
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,079
This stands tall as
a Buddhist temple and

7
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,560
as a school for training
in Martial Arts

8
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,360
Being the first to teach
them this art...

9
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,320
and for having founded
the Shaolin Temple...

10
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
the man who is revered as
God by them even now was

11
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,840
the 3rd born prince
ofthe Pallava King..

12
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,600
Bodhi Dharman...

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,200
a Tamilan

14
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:53,880
1600 Years Back

15
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,200
Kanchipuram , Pallava Dynasty

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,320
This school is a part
ofthe Pallava Dynasty

17
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,080
at a time when other countries
engaged in human sacrifice...

18
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,000
We...

19
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,920
Along with several other arts

20
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,040
Medicine was also a special
part ofthe curriculum

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,720
The cure for several deadly diseases

22
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,200
lay in an amazing form
of Medicine called...

23
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,400
Sarahasamruthi.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,400
An expert in all these forms was

25
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,360
Bodhi Dharman

26
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,760
Besides Martial Arts

27
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,600
He was also well versed in
the art of Mesmerism...

28
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,200
...the practice ofwhich enables
control ofthe 5 elements

29
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,800
As instructed by his Teacher...

30
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,040
The teacher has a rason
and a larger god in mind...

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
...by sending me to China

32
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,520
Mother, Faher, thank you
for understanding.

33
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,880
These are inscriptions l have written...

34
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,200
at the appropriate time, these will
prove important and useful

35
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,320
ARer a three year long
journey on land...

36
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,320
Bodhi Dharman reaches the village
of Nanyang in China.

37
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,000
The villagers predict that
huge danger awaits them

38
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,040
On seeing Bodhi Dharman
who reaches the village then

39
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,680
they assume him to be the evil force

40
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,360
They are relieved that the
danger has been averted

41
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,280
But the real danger...

42
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,840
The deadly disease thet killed
millions of people in China

43
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,120
struck that village as well.

44
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,560
Bodhi Dharman taught his
expertise in medicine...

45
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,760
to physicians who came from
several parts of China.

46
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,560
The village that had recovered
from disease

47
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,000
had another danger in store

48
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,080
Beasts in the human form

49
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,600
At a point when people knew only
of his medical proficiency..

50
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,360
They realised that he was a Master...

51
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,960
...in the base forms of
martial arts ''Kalari''

52
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,360
and had power to control
anyone through hypnotism

53
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
Never having seen a wonder like
that in all their lives

54
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,600
The Chinese wanted to learn
this art of self defense

55
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Bodhi Dharman who was fondly
referred as Damo...

56
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,120
... by the Chinese people

57
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,320
stayed in the village and
taught them his skills.

58
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,280
Several years later

59
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,760
when he announced his decision
to return to his motherland.

60
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,360
Once again they misinterpret
the Astrological reading

61
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:47,280
Bodhi Dharman realizes that
his food has beed poisoned

62
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,800
They pleaded that if
Bodhi Dharman's...

63
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,440
mortal remains are buried in that soil...

64
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,960
their county will be rid
of any disease in future

65
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,760
Bodhi Dharman accepts their plea.

66
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,080
Even today, Bodhi Dharman
is worshipped...

67
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:31,960
in the many temples build
for him across China.

68
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,880
This Tamilan who is being
worshipped in places...

69
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
...like Japan , China and Thailand

70
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,120
is known to how many of us?

71
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,600

turns against us?

84
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,080
Great Bombay Circus

85

Arvind stay here for _o
minutes l'll be back- OK

534
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,800
Subha, l have been
waiting for you

535
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:39,960
Have you brought it?

536
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,000
Ye, l have

537
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,360
How is your research going?

538
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:43,960
l completed the research
4 months back

539
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,920
l have sent my thesis
to China and US

540
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,200
l have application for
permission here. - Is that so?

541
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,600
You've taken a big risk
for me Uncle

542
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,320
lt's lying idle, let it be
of use at least to you

543
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,800
The inspection is tomorrow

544
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,320
lt's fine ifwe keep
it back before that.

545
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,280
You've told the guy,
haven't you?

546
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,920
Will you be free at 10.OO am tomorrow?

547
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,280
l want to talk to you

548
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,160
Sure, we can talk.
l need to talk to you too

549
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,200
We are probably going to speak
about the same thing

550
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,120
- Uncle
- Who's that girl?

551
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,800
did you see her.
She's my girl.

552
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,320
-Wait let me call her
- Stop it

553
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:09,880
For how long do you know her?

554
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,880
Around 2 and a half months.
Why?

555
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,680
2 and a half months?

556
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,280
Do you know she has been
searching for you...

557
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:15,960
... for the last 1 and halfyears?

558
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:17,120
No way

559
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,440
She came here to find a monkey
for research...

560
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:20,000
....that's when l met her
for the first time.

561
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,200
She wasn't looking for a monkey

562
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,640
she's looking for you

563
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:24,400
she came to our town One
and a halfyears back

564
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:26,240
She was enquiring about the
lineage of Bodhi Dharman

565
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:28,000
and took blood tests of all our relatives

566
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:30,520
She compared the portrait of
Bodhi dhrman with your photo

567
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:33,040
and enquired about your name
where you work and all ofthat

568
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,040
l saw her here aRer that

569
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
She acted as if she knew nothing

570
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,320
She said she didn't know you

571
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,800
Your Aunt told me then

572
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,280
l didn't believe her

573
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:43,160
And now she's dropping you
off and waving out to you

574
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,680
Arvind hey l just dropped you

575
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,000
Who are you?

576
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,760
Have you been following me
for one and halfyear?

577
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:04,840
Tell me...

578
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:07,120
What do you want from me?

579
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,440
Arvind no... Look here

580
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,160
Evemhing is a plan...

581
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,400
You've cheated me with a plan

582
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:00,200
That is what l wanted to speak
to you about tomorrow

583
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:02,080
l am doing a research

584
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,360
l was a fool to believe you

585
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,080
eveyone asked me why
you were behind me

586
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,080
l never struck me

587
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,080
Lies , Lies all of it.

588
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:15,000
She's done a post morterm
on me when l am alive

589
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,880
l tried telling you earlier Arvind

590
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:17,960
Why did you have to?

591
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,280
do you explain things
to lab rats or rabbits

592
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:25,480
l tried telling you even
on the second day

593
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:26,880
You were the one who got it confused

594
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:30,240
...with love and all ofthat

595
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,400
Had l told you
l didn't love you

596
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:34,440
l was afraid you wouldn't
agree to the research

597
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,760
l was wondering how to tell you

598
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:39,000
lfyou assume love blooms even
ifwe just shake hands

599
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,160
What can l do?

600
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,560
don't utter a word

601
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:44,320
You were the one who followed
me eveywhere

602
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:47,120
You will do anything
to get yourjob done

603
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:48,760
give away anything

604
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,000
Arvind , don't...

605
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:52,080
Your words seem to mean
something else

606
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,440
l mean it all ways

607
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,120
lt's your fault that you've
never socialized with girls

608
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,880
For someone who has only
been around animals

609
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,400
even if a girl just smiles,
it will seem like love.

610
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:07,800
Yes

611
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,560
l thought it was love...

612
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,560
the animals have never smiled at me.

613
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:15,960
neither did they put up an act with me

614
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:17,840
You smiled...

615
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,640
and l believed you

616
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,800
Nothing you did is wrong

617
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,600
My falling in love is the
only thing that is wrong

618
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,520
Yes

619
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,920
What else do you know besides love?

620
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:34,200
Throw your love in the trash...

621
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,640
My dearest my love...

622
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,560
Why did you go away from me

623
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:34,720
My heart's been wounded...

624
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:39,840
Mu butterFly has lost its colour.

625
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:46,200
A man's love is like the lines
on the palm(permanent)

626
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:51,320
A women's love is like the
kerchief(Momentay)

627
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:55,600
l kept her in my dreams....

628
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,680
but she has stolen my eyes...

629
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,320
She gave me a flute

630
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,360
but walked away with my breath...

631
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:37,000
Many men have been way
Iaid by women...

632
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:42,440
And now l am the last to
have joined this list...

633
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:45,040
lfyou dive down to get a pearl

634
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:47,680
You will hold your breath
on your own...

635
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,320
ARer you get the pearl of love

636
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:53,000
your heart will go made
cause ofthe woman

637
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,080
She has gone away from me

638
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,600
Her eyes have lied

639
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:01,120
Love is nothing but useless talk.

640
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:04,040
My heart's wounded because ofyou

641
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,360
The path of love is
filed with thorns...

642
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:13,160
There's no men who's got past it

643
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,280
Love is like an intoxicating drug

644
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,920
lfyou take it. It's a
tough journey ahead

645
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,040
My dearest my love...

646
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:34,000
why did you go away from me

647
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:38,800
My heart's been wounded

648
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,680
My butterFly has lost its colour

649
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:41,400
A bamboo that has holes
can play music

650
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,000
A heart that has been
drilled with hurt

651
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,080
still sings a song on you

652
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,760
A chariot from the divine garden
is who l believed you were

653
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,280
l am now sorromul cause

654
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,160
l realise you're just a strand
and not the flowe it holds

655
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,360
Don't steal me with a plan

656
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,960
Don't stand aRer and
(pretend to) brood

657
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,680
Don't distrub me like the black ant

658
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,080
My heartjust can't bear this

659
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:12,000
You are the contour ofthe rainbow

660
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:17,440
Where have you gone past my sky

661
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,440
ls there a place that has no love?

662
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:28,080
Can you blindfold me
and take me there

663
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,520
My dearest My love

664
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,040
Why did you go away from me

665
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,120
My heart's been wounded,

666
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:48,760
My butterFly has lost its colour

667
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,320
Arvind

668
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,920
Won't you leave me?

669
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,040
l cannot leave you

670
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:40,600
Poor guy

671
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:41,960
He hasn't slept a wink

672
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,120
He has been looking lost

673
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,720
Can you come out for an hour with me?

674
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:46,880
Yeah right

675
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:48,600
this is how you took him
earlier and ditched him

676
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,200
What fault can you find with Arvind?

677
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:51,320
Keep quiet

678
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,600
Just come out with me for an hour

679
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,800
Hey go along....

680
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,880
You go and wait near the bike

681
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,720
GOVERMENT MUSEUM

682
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:16,440
Why did you ask me to come?

683
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,520
l'll tell you

684
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,720
There's a stoy behind each
and evey thing here

685
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,640
Those of us living here today
are not true Tamilians

686
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,680
The ones who taught the world about...

687
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,800
... Valour and civilization many
thousand years back

688
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:31,400
they were the truw Tamilians

689
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,520
This is not a museum

690
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,720
This is a memorial for the many
Tamilians who lived like that

691
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,200
Will you believe me if l said
our ancient study of sciences is...

692
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,880
... around 500 years ahead of
today's modern science?

693
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,480
Today, space research scientists
tell you about....

694
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,640
...the 9 planets and their names
with the help of a telescope

695
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:55,560
But several 1000 years back

696
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,520
we worshipped the 9 planets
in our temples

697
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:58,960
How was that?

698
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,520
How was Ayabhatta able to gauge....

699
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,320
the weight ofthe earth
1500 years back?

700
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:08,280
The forecast says it will rain
tomorrow but it's doesn't

701
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,520
They say it will be sunny
but it rains...

702
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,960
That's modern science

703
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:14,960
They can accurately arrive at
the full moon or no moon day...

704
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,800
...for even 20 years with our Almanac
(Panchangam)

705
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,400
That is our science...

706
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:24,040
Look at this Book

707
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,880
This book and l have no connection...

708
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,440
But you have a connection
with this book

709
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:36,520
Do you know who wrote this book?

710
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:37,680
The Great Master

711
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,720
'Bodhi Dharman'

712
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,560
A tamilian

713
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,160
Osho calls him another Buddha...

714
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:01,120
Before we find out what
is in this book...

715
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,480
let's go to one more place

716
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,400
Look at these childrens.

717
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,640
All ofthem have Cancer

718
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:20,360
Cancer when they are l or 8

719
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:22,000
what harm did they do?

720
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:25,680
Did they smoke? Or did
they eat guthka?

721
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,840
Why this disease at such a young age?

722
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,120
They are mentally challenged children...

723
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,760
While all other kids
go to school happily...

724
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,320
... they are struggling for life

725
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:53,320
What is the reason for this?

726
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,120
Genatic disorder

727
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:02,640
A man's DNA determines

728
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:05,480
his disease as well as his talents.

729
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:08,520
Each call in our body has this DNA

730
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:10,400
ln simple words...

731
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,440
hereditay disease
hereditay behavior..

732
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,160
both come through DNA

733
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,200
Heart attack , Knee pain , Diabetes

734
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,640
the disease that those children had..

735
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:22,280
the root of all this is
in our hereditay DNA

736
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,880
Diseases and defects that
are passed on through DNA

737
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,560
...can be rectified in the DNA itself...

738
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,520
... this is what my research is about

739
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,880
One more important thing...

740
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:36,400
We can also bring back hereditay
talents through this DNA research

741
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,200
An artist , A warrior's hereditay DNA

742
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,240
will still cary those talents.

743
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,360
By stimulating them

744
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,760
we can bring back those
hereditay talents

745
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:51,040
Bodhi Dhrman has written about
this in that book 1600 years back

746
01:11:52,119 --> 01:11:56,120
a book that was written 1600 years
back speaks about DNA research?

747
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:59,920
We need to see these great people
as Scientists not as Gods.

748
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:03,560
2 years back a research organization...

749
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,440
Dug up the place were bodhi
Dharman was buried

750
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,640
Look at here

751
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,640
They got DNA details of Bodhi Dhraman

752
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,800
through his hair and teeth from
his mummified remains

753
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:16,480
l saw this on the internet

754
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:23,360
This is Bodhi Dharman's DNA

755
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,080
l learnt that people from
Bodhidharma's lineage..

756
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,560
Your relatives still lived
near Kancheepuram

757
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:34,200
l want in search ofthem

758
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:35,160
'KANCHIPURAM'

759
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,400
l tested them to check if
Bodhi Dharman's DNA pattern...

760
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,280
...matched anyone ofyour relatives

761
01:13:04,039 --> 01:13:05,440
That's when l went to
your Uncle's house

762
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,400
l saw something amazing
in that house

763
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,120
A picture ofyours that had a
striking resemblance in Bodhi Dharaman

764
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,080
l took your hair sample
from a comb you had used

765
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,040
As l guessed

766
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,880
your DNA pattern matched Bodhi
Dharman's more then 800/o

767
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:51,600
l came in search ofyou aRer that

768
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:00,440
When you got hurt at the circus and
were admitted at the hospital...

769
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,120
l took all the test that were needed
for my research through the docters

770
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,120
Bodhi Dharman's talents
are there in your DNA

771
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,400
This is called genetic memoy

772
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:14,440
When this memoy is activated , Bodhi
Dharman's talents will come in to you

773
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,880
Can bring back the Bodhi Dharman...

774
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,200
...who lived 1600 years back
with the same talents

775
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,720
How will those talents be useful today

776
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:28,120
Bodhi dharman was a great
Medical practitioner

777
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,520
ln our county's mountains
are filled with...

778
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,840
...thousands of herbs that cure
severa diseases.

779
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:37,720
The details ofthese were erased
with the many invasions that happened later

780
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,880
Bodhi Dharman knew the use of
evey leaf and evey root.

781
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,120
That(knowledge) should
benefit the whole world

782
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:48,280
All this can happen only
ifyou agree to it.

783
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,560
what should l do now?

784
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,760
Hey what are you doing there?

785
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,040
Yes , you?

786
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,280
He doesn't look like a Gurkha..
Who are you?

787
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:43,720
What are you doing?

788
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,280
Getup

789
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,720
Look at what this is...

790
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,200
Needle, Medicine, Gloves, Box...

791
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,720
l can see the skeleton

792
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,160
Who are you man?

793
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,240
- Thanks Arvind
- For what?

794
01:19:22,039 --> 01:19:23,200
For agreeing to be a
part of my research

795
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,000
The meeting that is going to happen
now, it's been my dream for 3 years

796
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,320
What's with 3 years?

797
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,760
l started my research 3 years back

798
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:33,160
l've taken a lot of refernces and
have finished it theoratically

799
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,880
Sent it to America , China , Canada

800
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,200
None ofthe countries
responded though

801
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:40,640
why, can't this research
be done in India

802
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:41,480
Yes can

803
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,920
but need Goverment permission to
conduct research on a live person

804
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:46,640
That's why this meeting

805
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:48,440
Vey big scientists are going
to be a part ofthe meeting

806
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,880
but l can explain my research
vey clearly

807
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,160
This is my prof.Rangarajan

808
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:11,200
He is well connected with all
the scientists in the world

809
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:12,680
He encourages me a lot

810
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,600
l have to cite a lot of examples
from Tamil histoy...

811
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,200
...and Tamil Medicine to
support my findings

812
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,320
Can l speak in Tamil?

813
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:53,920
Bodhi Dharman was a
near equal to Buddha

814
01:20:54,359 --> 01:20:55,880
He lived in the 6th Centuy

815
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:59,480
He was well accomplished in
Martial Arts and Medicine

816
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,760
when l did a DNA test on family
members from his lineage

817
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:07,440
l found that Arvind's DNA had most
of Bodhi Dharman's talents

818
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,680
My research is about activating
this genetic memoy

819
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,400
This is advanced DNA research

820
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,280
Even America is at a preliminay
stage in this

821
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,040
No Sir, Bodhi Dharman has written
the methodology for this in a book

822
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:20,520
You cannot do DNA research
based on a Tamil book

823
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,040
Should we ignore a book only
because it's written in Tamil?

824
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,600
This has become a fashion Mr.Nelson

825
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,960
They bring up Tamil for
evemhing. Nuisance

826
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,720
Yes.. if English which is 800
years old is important to you..

827
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:37,640
Tamil, which is 20,OOO years
old is important to us.

828
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,280
lt's just been 2 lakh years since
mankind evolved but been...

829
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,520
....10 lakh years since Monkeys did

830
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,680
Does that make monkey more
important than humans?

831
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:46,720
Tamil is like the monkey

832
01:21:47,239 --> 01:21:49,480
lt's been around longer
but of no use

833
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,160
Let him utter one more wrong word
about Tamil and he's had it...

834
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,760
Eveyone here knows Tamil, right?

835
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:02,040
Then why snigger when
l speak in Tamil?

836
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:04,120
lsn't your grandfather from
the village nearby?

837
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,160
Will you forget Tamil because
you are settled in Germany?

838
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,280
lf one has grey hair and speaks
in English , you'll believe

839
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,280
You'll laugh if one speaks in Tamil

840
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,240
How can youngsters achieve anything?

841
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,800
Reservation , recommendation
corruption...

842
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,560
That's why all the talented
ones are running away abroad

843
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,720
The English came here and enslaved us

844
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,840
now we go there and
enslave ourselves

845
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:24,360
What's the difference?

846
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,960
This is why l did not want
to call youngsters.

847
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,480
ls she a girl?
She said she'll hit us

848
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:39,480
what happened?

849
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:42,080
People abroad don't respect
us because we are Indians

850
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:44,440
People here don't respect us
because we are Tamilians

851
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:46,200
What are they saying?

852
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,920
They are not ready to even listen

853
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,240
Excuse me...We read your
assignment yesterday.

854
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:53,440
lt will be successful for sure.

855
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:56,240
But they won't encourage you here
you head to the U.S

856
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,040
Won't they listen to all ofyou

857
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:02,120
Sory sir, Ifwe say something
they play with our internal exams

858
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:03,760
- How?
- This is our numbers

859
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,520
lfyou need any help with your
research please call us

860
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:11,240
ls any alternatives?
-We can not do without their support

861
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,640
Are you, Subha Srinivasan?

862
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,080
Yes its me

863
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,720
There's an enquiy

864
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:18,480
Don't be afraid .Can
we go to the station

865
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,520
Can l come along?

866
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,640
Most certainly, come

867
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,840
Do you know that boy?

868
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,120
Santhosh!!!
Who stays below my house

869
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,320
Why is he....

870
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,760
He slashed his father's neck

871
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:38,680
Man's dead on the spot

872
01:23:39,399 --> 01:23:40,720
This happened in front ofyour house

873
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:44,560
He's bluffering says some Japanese or
Chinese man came in search ofyou...

874
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:48,320
Santhosh

875
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,040
l didn't do anything

876
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,160
Dad heared a noise and went to check

877
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,320
A Chinese man was tying
to open your door

878
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,560
He tried stopping him and
was enquiring with him

879
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,080
l followed him...

880
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,320
l don't know anything aRer that

881
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,160
He has been saying the same
thing again and again

882
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,920
He is the man

883
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,680
He came.. Run...
He is looking for you

884
01:24:57,079 --> 01:24:58,520

Don't stay here Please go

889
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:58,880
He just looked

890
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:00,960
and the policeman fired

891
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:02,960
Who is he?

892
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:05,200
l didn't even believe it when
the boy spoke about him..

893
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,840
How?

894
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,560
That's Hypnotism

895
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,720
That went from India

896
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,520
But why has he come from china

897
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,080
What is the need to kill us?

898
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:23,360
Don't know why?

899
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:25,160
Turn the auto around

901
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:29,680

Why is he killing?
We have no clue

904
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:34,160

905
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,240
Turn the auto around

906
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,040
Arvind, let's not take a risk

907
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,400
Follow that car , trun around

908
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,520
Someone who helps him is here

909
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,320

910
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,560

Come in, quick

912
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,600
This doesn't look like
a professor's house

913
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,120
We don't know when they
are going to be back

914
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:17,240

915
01:29:18,279 --> 01:29:19,360
You haven't told me

916
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,040

01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,720
This Chinese man's name
is probably Dong Lee

928
01:30:37,159 --> 01:30:39,280
But what is the link
with this professor?

929
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,000
They have illegally given him
300 Crores in Indian money

they will ask to meet at a public
place, not in the department

941
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,360
Subha, can we meet at
the Alwarpet signal tomorrow?

942
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,360
Not at the department...

Where's your family?

949
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:08,600
Are they from Chennai?

950
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,320
These questions struck you just now?

951
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,960
Dad was a big Sidha practitioner
in Tanjavur.

952
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,440
Vey talanted

953
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,120
He could easily cure diseases that
even big doctors could not diagnose

954
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:24,160
This affected their business

955
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,200
hence they framed charges on him
cakked him a quack and

956
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:30,720
Jailled him for 3 years

957
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,040
He stopped speaking to people and

958
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:35,040
died shortly aRer that

959
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,880

She wants me to tell Arvind that
she interested in him

972
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,760
lf l refuse, she asks me
if l am in love with him

973
01:34:01,239 --> 01:34:01,600
Why?

974
01:34:02,119 --> 01:34:02,800
Shouldn't l?

975
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:06,760
He kind of agreed to the research
in his love failure mood

976
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,680
But l shouldn't get confused
with all that now

977
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,520
This is not love

978
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,440

979
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,680

Go to Pary's Corner

1083
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:26,040

Get offthe auto and walk

1088
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,600
Can you see a Subway there?

1089
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,240
Get in to the Subway

1090
01:43:17,479 --> 01:43:18,080
Have you got in?

1091
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,520
Go up at the
Shanthi theater point

1092
01:43:48,039 --> 01:43:48,680

01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:51,840
Get in to the bus in front ofyou

1094
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,280

All of a sudden...- come in

01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:33,680
What happened sir?

1096
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:35,920
-Who hit you Sir?
- Me

1097
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:39,760
Do you know what he did?

1098
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:41,760
He has been paid 300 crores
Rupees from China

1099
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:43,800
They are going to do something
called Operation Red

1100
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,560
Tell me what that is

1101
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:51,760
Operation Red is a Bio War
waged by China on India

1102
01:44:55,159 --> 01:44:56,040
Bio War means?

1103
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:59,720
Earlier when countries
were at war

1104
01:45:00,279 --> 01:45:01,360
they had sword fights

1105
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:05,160
then they shot at each other
from a distance

1106
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:09,520
later launched missiles and dropped
nuclear bombs from wherever they were

1107
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:16,040
but this bio war neither gun nor a missile

1108
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:18,040
l's a virus

1109
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:21,680
ln the 6th centuy

1110
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:26,520
millions of people in China died of
a virus called ''Hong Se''

1111
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:31,240
Dong Lee is the specialist sent
to re-create the same virus...

1112
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,880
... and spread it across India

1113
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:39,760
He has injected that virus
to a street dog

1114
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:46,880
ln 24 hours, the injected dog would be

1115
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:49,480
...fully affected by the disease

1116
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:29,320
By now this disease would
have spread to many dogs

1117
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,120
from dogs it will spread
to humans quickly

1118
01:46:51,479 --> 01:46:54,200
Earlier scientists discovered
cure to diseases

1119
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:57,600
These days they invent
new diseases

1120
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:00,880
No one can find a cure to this disease

1121
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:04,600
But the Chinese has a medicine
to treat this disease

1122
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:09,640
lts the medical notes Bodhi Dharman
wrote more then 1600 year back

1123
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:19,400
ln 60 days more than 30 million
ofthe Indian population will die..

1124
01:47:19,479 --> 01:47:20,200
..because ofthis disease

1125
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,920
When people get frantic without
a cure for this disease

1126
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:26,360
China will release their medicine

1127
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,920
To get this medicine India will have
to agree to any policies China poses

1128
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:34,320
That's the reason for this Bio War

1129
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,520
Oh My

1130
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:43,040
But why is he behind Subha?

1131
01:47:43,479 --> 01:47:48,520
l sent Subha's thesis to China
three months back

1132
01:47:49,479 --> 01:47:52,800
Bodhi Dharman's DNA research
was a shock to them

1133
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,760
lf Bodhi Dharman's
talents can be activated

1134
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,440
he can easily find a cure for this disease

1135
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:04,040
He is tying to kill both of
you in order to avoid this

1136
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:11,760
What do you want!!!

1137
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:13,920
Will you do anything for money?

1138
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,080
We already have problems of spurious
medicines and fake doctors

1139
01:48:16,399 --> 01:48:17,920
And as if existing diseases are
not enough now a new one?

1140
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,800
won't you think that this disease
can get your family too?

1141
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:21,040
Arvind one second

1142
01:48:23,159 --> 01:48:25,560
We need to find out ifthis
disease has spread in the city

1143
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:27,440
My Uncle works with the City Corporation

1144
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:28,880
can find out ifwe call him

1145
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:36,720
Tell me Ashwin

1146
01:48:37,479 --> 01:48:38,960
l need urgent information

1147
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:41,040
ls there a new disease that
has spread in the city?

1148
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,880
has someone died?

1149
01:48:43,159 --> 01:48:44,240
also want to know from
the veterinay hospital

1150
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:45,880
lfthere is a new disease
that is spreading to dogs

1151
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,440
Give me 20 minutes
l'll call you myself

1152
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:51,520
He said he'll call in 20 minutes

1153
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:55,880
Yes, it was our car that leR from
the Mount Road post office at 9.30am

1154
01:48:56,319 --> 01:48:58,480
lt was booked by Subha Srinivasan

1155
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,720
But can't tell you
where we dropped her

1156
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:04,040
lt's against our rules
to give you the details

1157
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,000
The car will be there in 10 minutes

1158
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,120
Haven't you leR yet?

1159
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:33,040
Can't give details for
a name like that

1160
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,240
Hello Uncle tell me

1161
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:55,760
Ashwin you were right

1162
01:49:56,399 --> 01:49:59,080
6 people got admitted at
Madha hospital yesterday

1163
01:49:59,239 --> 01:50:02,440
ofthem one died at 8.30
and another at 1 1 .3O

1164
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,520
They are unable to diagnose the ailment

1165
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,840
More than 300 dogs have
come in for treatment at...

1166
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:09,960
.. the veterinay hospital on the same day

1167
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,720
This is all l have for now

1168
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,760
Ok we need to go to
Madha hospital immediately

1169
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:17,360
What do we do with him?

1170
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,120
lmran , is there a land line
in this room? - No

1171
01:50:35,319 --> 01:50:36,240
Let's take the stairs

1172
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,600
-Where is the general ward?
- Third floor

1173
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,880
God! It's the same disease that
came in the 6th centuy

1174
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,800
Bodhi Dharman went to China
to stop this coming to India

1175
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:41,040
and now it's here

1176
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:46,920
What a huge betrayal

1177
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,800
need to find that Chinese man
and kill him

1178
01:51:51,319 --> 01:51:53,160
No Arvind that's not
important now

1179
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,720
The disease that he has
spread is more dangerous

1180
01:51:56,319 --> 01:51:57,800
lfwe keep patients in
the general ward...

1181
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,040
... the disease will spread faster

1182
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:04,520
We need to shiR the patients
into isolation immediately

1183
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:08,600
Ashwin, contact the health minister
and explain the situation

1184
01:52:09,079 --> 01:52:12,680
lmran, collect medical reports of
all these patients and mail WHO

1185
01:52:13,079 --> 01:52:17,080
Give the full details about the disease
through telegram and mail

1186
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:21,760
Nisha , Malathi both ofyou contact
news channels and explain

1187
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:25,080
Arvind, l'll go and meet the Dean
ofthis hospital

1188
01:52:25,399 --> 01:52:27,040
You go and find out where
the Chief Doctor is

1189
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:30,480
What are you saying?

1190
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,600
A disease that came in 6th centuy?
-Yes Doctor

1191
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,280
this disease came to China in
the 6th centuy and lakhs...

1192
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:36,200
...of people died because of it

1193
01:52:36,439 --> 01:52:39,120
A man called Bodhi Dharman from
Kanchipuram went there and cure it

1194
01:52:39,319 --> 01:52:41,280
Oh! the first doctor
who went abroad

1195
01:52:41,479 --> 01:52:43,200
Now that disease has
come back to India

1196
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:43,880
3 ofthose patients are
admited in your hospital

1197
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:47,200
What are you saying?

1198
01:52:47,399 --> 01:52:50,480
Patients in bed numbers 16 , ll
and 18 in the general ward

1199
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,040
Oh the patients from Ayanavaram

1200
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,680
That's Chicken pox

1201
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,040
lfwe give a dose of anti viral
they'll get discharged on Monday

1202
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:01,600
No doctor , they need to be
isolated immediately

1203
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:03,000
lfyou keep them in
general ward...

1204
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:04,600
...it will spread to other
patinets in 3 days

1205
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,080
ShiR them to a private
ward immediately

1206
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:08,080
and give face masks to the
Doctors and nurses attenting to them

1207
01:53:08,399 --> 01:53:09,320
Look here girl, need to do
the blood test...

1208
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:11,160
...urine culture
and all ofthat

1209
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,480
lt will take 5 days for
the results to come

1210
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,280
They'll be treated for
chicken pox till then

1211
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:17,560
We'll change medication
ifthey don't get better

1212
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,960
Doctor please ty to understand
we can't have time for that

1213
01:53:21,079 --> 01:53:23,960
l don't have time either
l have to attend the out patients

1214
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:25,800
The chief doctor is vey strict

1215
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,200
you can't see him without bribe

1216
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,480
Hey! this is vey important

1217
01:54:31,479 --> 01:54:33,080

Get out ofthe hospital
through the back gate

1219
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,440
Why?

1220
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:38,560
Dong Lee has come here

01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:40,720

1232
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:59,040
That's impossible

1233
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,320
Dong Lee can control
anyone mind

1234
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,360
where is he now?

1235
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:09,400
He is in Tamil Nadu , South India

1236
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:23,440
-He shouldn't be there
-whn

1237
01:57:24,159 --> 01:57:27,760
-Ask him to come back
- l cannot come

1238
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,160
Why couldn't l control his mind?

1239
01:57:32,319 --> 01:57:33,360
DAMO!

1240
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:39,960
That's Damo's bloodline

1241
01:57:41,079 --> 01:57:42,720
We have killed Damo himself

1242
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:45,720
Let's see what his blood can do

1243
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:55,800
Call them and ask them
to come here

1244
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:08,480
He's here
He's looking for us

1245
01:58:11,399 --> 01:58:12,000
Where?

1246
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:23,800
He's coming towards you
Iook down

1247
02:04:14,079 --> 02:04:15,000
Did Subha call?

1248
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:16,920
l believe he came to the hospital

1249
02:04:17,359 --> 02:04:18,200
ls seems like a big problem

1250
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:19,400
She's asked us to come too

1251
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:30,880
What happened Subha?

1252
02:04:31,239 --> 02:04:32,600
He's more dangerous that
we thought he was

1253
02:04:33,079 --> 02:04:36,000
We've fled to save our live
Arvind...

1254
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:44,160
What happened Arvind?

1255
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:48,640
Back then in Tamil Nadu

1256
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:50,960
lf a male child was born dead

1257
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:52,760
they'd make a maek on his
chest before buying him

1258
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,280
They told never to show
your back and flee at war

1259
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,880
and today was it really brave
that we ran to save our lives?

1260
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:03,200
and now they've come to
Tamil Nadu to strike us

1261
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:06,400
We can only run from them

1262
02:05:11,239 --> 02:05:13,040
lt was different back then

1263
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,040
You said we taught Valour
to the world

1264
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:21,880
Can you see we are getting
beaten in anywhere now

1265
02:05:25,159 --> 02:05:26,280
We have to hit back

1266
02:05:30,159 --> 02:05:31,480
He shouldn't get back
alive from our land

1267
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:33,840
No Arvind,
he's too powerFul

1268
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,840
We can't win against him

1269
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:37,040
Right we can't

1270
02:05:38,239 --> 02:05:39,280
That's what we've told
ourselves

1271
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:41,480
and locked up our valour
along with the swards at the museum

1272
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,680
We need to bring that out

1273
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:49,080
Arvind we need to first
understand our situation

1274
02:05:50,119 --> 02:05:52,360
Our neighboring county fought
in the name ofValour

1275
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:54,000
did they win?

1276
02:05:54,279 --> 02:05:55,200
We only died

1277
02:05:59,479 --> 02:06:01,880
Get the difference be_een
Valour and Betrayal

1278
02:06:03,159 --> 02:06:06,200
lf 9 countries got together
to kill 1 Tamilian

1279
02:06:07,039 --> 02:06:08,600
...that is not called Valour

1280
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,840
That's Betrayal

1281
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:12,640
l understand Arvind

1282
02:06:13,359 --> 02:06:15,320
l didn't say we should let him go

1283
02:06:16,239 --> 02:06:19,320
We have to first stop the disease
that is spreading by the minute.

1284
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:20,800
Then go aRer him

1285
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:23,600
Both look impossible in
the different situation

1286
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,440
lt's possible

1287
02:06:26,359 --> 02:06:30,680
Only one person can cure
the disease and destroy him

1288
02:06:31,239 --> 02:06:32,440
Bodhi Dharman

1289
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:38,200
We need to start that DNA research

1290
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,280
We need to bring back Bodhi
Dharman's talents

1291
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:42,360
Let's hit back at him
the way you wanted

1292
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:43,760
We should strike back so hard

1293
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,480
that no one in the darkest
unseen comer ofthe world

1294
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:47,880
will dare to raise his
hands on a Tamilian

1295
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:50,240
We need a Human
Genetic Lab for that

1296
02:06:51,079 --> 02:06:52,040
No one should know about it

1297
02:06:52,439 --> 02:06:54,320
He shouldn't spot us for 12 days

1298
02:06:55,119 --> 02:06:56,760
-Ther's a lab l know
-wait

1299
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:00,200
lf no one should know where
we are going to before 12 days

1300
02:07:01,399 --> 02:07:02,920
one ofyou needs to stay back
and help from the out side

1301
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:05,320
And even he should not
know our whereabouts

1302
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:12,920
We need to de-activate
all our SIM cards

1303
02:07:13,079 --> 02:07:14,280
just 2 new SIM cards

1304
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:15,840
One for us and the other for Malathi

1305
02:07:16,279 --> 02:07:18,440
All the things we need will
come through Malathi

1306
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,440
but she won't know where
we are going to be

1307
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:21,760
l'll tell you how

1308
02:07:22,359 --> 02:07:24,520
Malathi, throw out your
cell phoen SIM card

1309
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:26,000
We'll send you a new card

1310
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:32,520
Now tell us where the lab is

1311
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:34,160
This is the Adayar bridge

1312
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:35,960
This is Gandhi Madapam

1313
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:37,200
This is the Cancer Institute

1314
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:39,720
The IlT campus is in be_een this

1315
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:41,800
This is the place Ashwin
was talking about

1316
02:07:42,119 --> 02:07:44,000
There is a big forest behind IlT

1317
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:46,160
lIT is spread across 650 acres

1318
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:47,920
Ofthis 450 acres is a forest

1319
02:07:48,359 --> 02:07:50,640
No one knows of such a big
forest within the city

1320
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:52,600
This is the composites
Technology Centre

1321
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,000
This the Machine Dynamic Centre

1322
02:07:54,359 --> 02:07:56,960
The Genetic Engineering
Lab is 4 kms from here

1323
02:07:57,159 --> 02:07:58,520
We are going to this Lab

1324
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:00,840
What if someone comes
there in 12 days?

1325
02:08:01,159 --> 02:08:03,480
Luckily it's the Semester
holidays time now

1326
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:05,440
lt will be closed for
the next 18 days

1327
02:08:07,399 --> 02:08:08,640
lt's all German equipments in there

1328
02:08:09,479 --> 02:08:12,000
lfwe need medicines or herbs

1329
02:08:12,279 --> 02:08:13,960
We'll get them through Malathi

1330
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:16,200
When will Ashwin come?

1331
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:17,640
He'll bring the keys to the Lab

1332
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:19,880
buy the new SIM cards and
come here by 1 1 pm

1333
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,840
Has eveyone de-activated
their SIM cards. - Done

1334
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:24,000
Lets go

1335
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:36,560
What's leR my friend?
For many days now

1336
02:08:37,039 --> 02:08:39,680
we have lost ourselves

1337
02:08:41,119 --> 02:08:44,960
Can you not believe?
Can we not do?

1338
02:08:45,319 --> 02:08:48,200
Let's make tomorrow
the day of victoy

1339
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:51,320
There's no one to stop us

1340
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,360
ther's no one to access you any less

1341
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:56,520
Let's agree to walk with faith

1342
02:08:58,039 --> 02:09:01,680
What is that you don't have?
What's the yearning in you eyes?

1343
02:09:02,119 --> 02:09:04,880
With pain is victoy always born

1344
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,640
lfwe rise we will
rise like the waves

1345
02:09:08,039 --> 02:09:09,760
lfwe fall we will
fall like the seed

1346
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:11,920
We will rise and soar
again and again

1347
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:16,120
We will firm this up
more and more

1348
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,200
Our lives will melt inside

1349
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:21,360
Army ofyouth, come on, Arise

1350
02:09:23,319 --> 02:09:26,680
What's leR my friend?
for many days now

1351
02:09:27,079 --> 02:09:30,120
we have lost ourselves

1352
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:35,280
Can you not believe?
Can we not do it?

1353
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:38,520
Let's make tomorrow
the day of victoy

1354
02:10:13,319 --> 02:10:16,640
when the mind thinks the
same thing each day

1355
02:10:17,039 --> 02:10:20,560
the heart will help
you achieve it

1356
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:24,880
The horizan is within our reach

1357
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:28,840
Let's get all our hands together

1358
02:10:30,039 --> 02:10:36,440
When we sow good seeds
can cactus grow from it?

1359
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:41,680
Even ifwe have come past
many generations

1360
02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:45,120
will the valour handed
down ever go away?

1361
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:50,560
One mind one character
one track for the future

1362
02:10:51,079 --> 02:10:54,680
The same strenght the same will
power, within and outside our bodies

1363
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:42,360
The mysterious disease
that has been spreading

1364
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:45,720
has claimed 1 18 lives
in Tamil Nadu so far

1365
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:52,480
People are on the roads protesting
against the lack of medical facilities

1366
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:21,440
A hospital in Kallakurichi was
attacked for refusing treatments

1367
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:31,960
The central Minister for health
has condemned the violence

1368
02:12:44,279 --> 02:12:51,240
We bear a weapon around
our necks in our arena

1369
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:59,800
We taste the weapon the power
in our words, in our language

1370
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:07,920
Will the blazzing sun ever disappear
because ofthe mist?

1371
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:16,160
Will the eyes ever sleep before
seeing the enemy's defeat?

1372
02:13:17,439 --> 02:13:21,360
Now we have come together
have joined hands

1373
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:25,640
There we see the place
in front of our eyes

1374
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,600
There's no one to stop us
there's no one to assess you any less

1375
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:49,680
Lets agree to walk with faith

1376
02:13:51,399 --> 02:13:55,040
What is it that you don't have?
What's the yearning in your eyes?

1377
02:13:55,399 --> 02:13:58,120
With pain is victoy always born

1378
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,000
lfwe rise, we will
rise live the waves

1379
02:14:01,359 --> 02:14:03,040
lfwe fall we will
fall like the seed

1380
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:06,200
We will ise and soar
again and again

1381
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:09,280
We will firm this up more and more

1382
02:14:10,039 --> 02:14:11,360
Our lives will melt inside

1383
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:13,320
Army ofyouth come on

1384
02:14:14,039 --> 02:14:14,720
Arise

1385
02:17:32,319 --> 02:17:33,040
What is it?

1386
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:42,280
Did you check for evemhing
in the list?

1387
02:19:49,559 --> 02:19:52,080
lmran , how is Malathi's
phone with you?

1388
02:19:52,639 --> 02:19:53,840
Where is Malathi?

1389
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:57,520
Why are you giving
the address now?

1390
02:20:24,799 --> 02:20:25,920
What happened Imran?

1391
02:21:32,479 --> 02:21:33,920
We cannot continue the research now

1392
02:21:34,239 --> 02:21:35,200
He must be heading here now

1393
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:38,520
Today is the last day

1394
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:40,240
do you want us to run
just to save our lives?

1395
02:21:43,319 --> 02:21:43,960
No subha

1396
02:21:44,319 --> 02:21:45,920
Arvind's life is more important
than ours now

1397
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:47,680
Bodhi Dharman's DNA is important

1398
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:52,680
lf not us, someone else will continue
this research aRer 50 years hence

1399
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:54,120
but for that to happen
Arvind must live

1400
02:21:57,079 --> 02:21:58,600
But where do we take Arvind

1401
02:21:58,879 --> 02:21:59,920
sunlight shouldn't fall on his body

1402
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:09,640
Even ifwe all die, we will
save Arvind's life. Come

1403
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Cover his hands

1404
02:23:51,559 --> 02:23:52,960
-Subha
-What?

1405
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:54,120
Dong Lee is here

1406
02:33:03,959 --> 02:33:04,800
Just as it is imporant for a lost kid

1407
02:33:05,399 --> 02:33:06,400
to know about name of parents

1408
02:33:06,719 --> 02:33:08,280
and the address

1409
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:11,400
it's important for us
to know our histoy

1410
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:14,520
We've forgotten our science because
we have forgetten our histoy

1411
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,600
The many rulers who ruled us
didn't want us to know...

1412
02:33:17,879 --> 02:33:19,920
..about our Greatness or Valour
they hide it from us on purpose

1413
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:22,720
They erased our identity in the
name of conversion be it...

1414
02:33:22,959 --> 02:33:24,560
.. Language , Race or Religion

1415
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:29,320
They made us burn priceless ancient
Palm leaf inscriptions...

1416
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:30,240
...during the Bogi festival

1417
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:31,400
What's worse..

1418
02:33:31,719 --> 02:33:33,720
Records of histoy
numerous inventions

1419
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:38,840
thousands of rare books were
burnt to ashes in Yazhpanam libray

1420
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:42,720
Know our histoy and teach it to
those who don't know about it

1421
02:33:43,639 --> 02:33:46,760
Don't give a religious connotation
to the usage ofturmeric

1422
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:48,000
talk about the science behind it

1423
02:33:48,319 --> 02:33:49,520
teach them it is an anti-biotic

1424
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:50,720
And because we failed to do that

1425
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:53,640
a county that doesn't grow turmeric
has taken the patent rights for it

1426
02:33:54,319 --> 02:33:55,920
To avoid germs from
entering the house...

1427
02:33:56,239 --> 02:33:58,000
cowdung was sprinkled
and kolam was drawn

1428
02:33:58,360 --> 02:33:59,360
as we did not teach
this why we are

1429
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:01,040
sticking kolams in tiles

1430
02:34:01,799 --> 02:34:05,320
Tell tham neem tree thulasi tree
in house is all medicines

1431
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:08,000
We must teach our next
generation on how we

1432
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:10,880
...were living. We were the
pathbeares for this world..

1433
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:12,680
And because we have
not done this

1434
02:34:12,879 --> 02:34:14,080
we lost evemhing and

1435
02:34:14,479 --> 02:34:16,200
We are awe struck
by smaller countries

1436
02:34:16,479 --> 02:34:17,520
and are tying to toe their line

1437
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:18,480
That's not all

1438
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:21,480
just like we send export quality
clothes and fruits abroad

1439
02:34:21,799 --> 02:34:24,240
we are also exporting
intelligent Tamilians

1440
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:26,280
We've not only forgotten
Bodhi Dharman

1441
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:30,600
but several thousands of great
scholars and great minds that lived here

1442
02:34:31,399 --> 02:34:33,800
They are all alive in your DNA

1443
02:34:34,399 --> 02:34:35,840
They are alive in our blood

1444
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:39,240
lt's not that you have to bring
them out only through research

1445
02:34:40,239 --> 02:34:41,720
you can bring them out
through our efforts

1446
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:48,760
Tribute to destroyed Tamilians
and unbeaten Tamil
