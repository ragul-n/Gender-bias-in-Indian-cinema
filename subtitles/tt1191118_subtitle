Satvari Choudhary! Age 25 years,

10
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,851
By the way women used to join
their house jobs in small cities

11
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,714

They all are gone,

19
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,403
Someone's husband is sick, someone's
mother in law don't allow her,

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,504
and someone is pregnant,

28
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,608

42
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,770

Less sugar, less milk, strong.

00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,295
Sir! You know that's not
my job,

51
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:44,009
Look! You don't teach me who

52
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,336
Coffee!

53
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,345
This is not right.

54
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,778
The boss is always right.

55
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,248
Remember that.

62
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,506
My father also called me Sat,

63
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,236
Do you have phone?

64
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,538

67
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,787

00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,066

00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,564
Darling whenever you want to come,

00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,035
My cabin's doors are always
open for you,

73
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,901
and they will be close when
you will come inside.

74
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,242
Your all problems...

75
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,349
Now I will have to learn
Haryanvi Language.

76
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,353
Leave it!
I will open it.

77
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,649
But he is saying you will open now.

78
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,425
Sir, nothing it reminds me
banana leaf,

79
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,461
We have our food on banana leaf,

80
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,561
Then do one thing go and eat on
banana leaf and ask for it.

81
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,267
Today is your first day so I thought
why don't we have lunch together.

82
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,778
It gains love when you eat together.

83
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,216
This man looks like flert.

84
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,261
You are not having your lunch
with Hardik.

85
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,331
A new girl...

86
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,868
Sir is busy with her that's why...

87
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,008
We had a tree in our village.

88
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,171
Whenever new leaves came to that tree
then older ones was gone,

89
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,477
I have read your bio data,

00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,826
Then you must have know to
watch dreams,

I was about to have it but

00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,231
No! I will eat it carefully.

102
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,647
We three wants to resign from this

103
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,011
But why?

104

We can work under this Boss
like Hardik,

105
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,656
He called us late night.

106
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,419
He called me for dinner,
it's too much harrisment.

107
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,862
Then where you will go?
Anywhere! But not in this hell.

108
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,036
You won't find heaven in this world.

109
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,036
Hell like him is hide on every place.

110
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,337
And you will have to stay in this hell
and make it heaven.

111
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,745
Madam! You are here.

112
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,585
No madam is here,

113
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,788
How was your lunch?

Only I know how did I survived.

115
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,258
I don't know how long
you will survive.

116
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,391
Then you didn't recognize me,

117
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,261
If he will try to come closer again,

118
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,402
then I will slap him like...

119
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,440
If you want to win the game so it's
necessary to stay in the ground.

120
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,309
So I will stay,

121
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,809
Really?

122
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,046

123
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,986

124
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,188
Driver! Stop the car,

125
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,521
My guest house is here.

126
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,359
Madam! I am leaving,
Listen!

127
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,327
You live her?
Yes!

128
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,800
This place is not good for
your living,

129
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,211
Do one thing! Bring your luggage
and come with me,

130
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,642
Where?
My house.

131
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,749
You live alone in this house,

132
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,883
I am not alone,
I have responsibilites...

133
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,616
of my office, my house and mine,

134
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,458
And your family member?
Where they live?

135
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:03,690
Lucknow!

136
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,863
We are six family members and
only I earn money,

137
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,357
So I have to do this job,
Do or die.

138
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,552
Here is my new composition,
Absolutely original,

139
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,655
It's a hindi song,

140
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,691
Who cares?
I am telling you,

141
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,664
The audience cares,

142
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,902
Where these hindis came from?

143
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,165
Because you are the son of
Pandit Duarka Jee,

144
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,934
and hindi music is running
in your blood,

145
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,803
I hate hindi music,
Just hear this,

146
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,917
Please! I am really stressed out
right now,

147
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,757
As you know to watch dreams,

148
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,720
you have to sleep,

149
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,356
Don't watch bigger dreams,

150
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,397
They deal with your respect
in cities like Mumbai,

151
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,433
Listen to me,

152
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,340
you join any job in your own city,

153
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,834
Run your own business.

154
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,146
Radha!

155
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,918
Sir! You?
Look what I got for you.

156
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,056
Itsn't it beautiful?

157
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,360
Wear small blouse with it,

158
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,137
you?
Yes it's me,

159
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,472
I thought it's Radha.

160
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,384
Hardik! You hold radha like this?

161
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,688
You didn't understand,

162
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,526
Actually...

163
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,863
I thought Radha is stealing something,

164
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,627
So I thought why shouldn't I
catch her red handed.

165
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,465
But it was you.
How did you get so taller?

166
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,333
I am standing on stool.

167
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:34,943
Stool!

168
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,884
You!

169
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,268
Sorry Mansi!

170
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,205
I woke up late,

171
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,199
No problem,

172
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,072
you were working all night long,

173
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,637
Our company has gonna tie up with a
huge fashion company in 15 days.

174
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,044
I am preparing presentation,

175
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,945
If they will like it then this time Vasu
couldn't stop my promotion,

176
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,085
Gentlemen!

177
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,984

179
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,361

180
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,331
Don't get nervous,

181
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,932
Mansi you are here,

182
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,134
Hardik has started the presentation
since long,

183
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,265
Oh God!

184
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,399
I think Vasu stole my file.

185
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,138
Great Mr. Hardik,
you have work very hard on this.

186
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,904
It will be a pleasure doing
business with you,

187
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,809
Thankyou!
Your country really inspires me,

188
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,644
I love china,
We are really happy,

189
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,409
We will send agreement in 15 days.

190
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,311
Yes, I really work hard on this,
Thankyou!

191
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,997
I think I was about to make
this presentation,

192
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,203
I think you were not ready for
this presentation,

193
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,271
I was ready for this presentation,

194
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,672
I was not ready for something else.

195
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,172
That's why you are doing this,

196
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,244
Mind your tongue Miss. Mansi.
I will not.

197
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,313
I have work hard and prepared
this presentation

198
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,281
A watchman couldn't become the
owner of the house with hard working.

199
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,726
I am not your stupid secretary,

200
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,662
Who you called stupid secretary?

201
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,868
Girls like you slept with them and...
Excuse me!

202
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,604
Just because I respect you it doesn't
mean that you will say anything,

203
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,465
Respect and you?

204
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,809
Did you left respect to make
some respect?

205
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,069
Entire office knew what happened
behind the closed door.

206
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,380
Your boss told everyone.

207
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,173
Which hotel? Which room no,

208
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,011
How many times, messages are
roaming in entire office.

209
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,855
Why only you got these messages?

210
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,226
Why not me?

211
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,159
Why would I send messages?

212
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:32,975
Yes Ashish!

213
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,005
No Hi No hello.

214
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,008
Yes Ashish!
Now what ashish will say,

215
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,740
I am in a really bad mood,

216
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,046
But I am in a very good mood,

217
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,078
Any problem?

218
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,748
My boss is a leech,
He is a dog.

219
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,953
Don't know how these guys
got job,

220
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,860
Every company has these kind
of dogs.

221
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,061
Listen to me!
Leave your job,

222
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,435
and come London to your Ashish.

223
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,196
My job is also confirmed,

224
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,133
Let's talk about marriage.

225
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,469
You know I can't come for one
more year.

226
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,243
I have some family problems,

227
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,613
And this Vasu...

228
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,772
He thinks every woman is a game,

229
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,878
Allow me to come India
and shoot him,

230
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,047
I know you can shoot him as well.

231
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,421
I will must teach him lesson.

232
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,319
But when we will get married?

233
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,229
I got another call,
I will call you back,

234
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,032
Just wait!

235
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,800
Just tell me once,
I love you.

236
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,076
Who you were talking to?
Not anyone let's have a coffee.

237
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,548
This is the fourth time,

238
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,342
He already took the credit of my
jobs thrice.

239
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,293
Candy! Whatever I did I did it
for your security.

240
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,696
I don't want that someone else
should try to flert with you.

241
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,266
That's why I sent those messages.

242
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,370
So people should think you are the
property of company's VP...

243
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:08,938
Mistress?

244
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,570
Don't call these harsh words.

245
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,971
I really care for you, I swear.

246
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,715
I just want to protect you,
Just like a condom,

247
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,316
you are right,
He is always right,

248
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,383
This is not the right place,
Let's go to some hotel.

249
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,423
We will discuss in room.

250
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,077
What did you think about me,

251
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,818
I wanted to make my house.

252
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,580
I wanted to work with respect,

253
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,793
I don't want to listen anything,

254
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,203
What a life?

255
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,308
Candy!

256
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,445
Till today we all knew you,

257
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,383
but today we recognize you too.

258
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,018
I am so sorry that we
made you wrong,

259
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,323
Welcome to the club.

260
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,298
I said welcome,

261
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,625
you will find these poeple
in every office.

262
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,821
We don't have to escape from them
we have to change them,

263
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,668
Do you know how to play football?

264
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,413
I know how to play hockey,
Wanna play?

265
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,947
I know how to play and I know
how to beat for that.

266
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,217
He said to me,

267
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,548
you want to sleep to
watch dreams,

268
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,625
I wish one day I would mix poison
in his coffee.

269
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,613
Vasu's girl is watching here.

270
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,290
You are the head of the department,

271
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,692
In lunch break it doesn't suits you to
chat with juniors.

272
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,497
I don't need your explantions,

273
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,536
What I want that's 99 account file now.

274
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,132
99? But that's in warehouse.

275
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,342
I knew that,
Go and bring it.

276
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,544
And bring coffee for me before that.

277
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,819
Except Mansi and Candy everyone
can go home,

278
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,971
He is showing candy's anger on me,

279
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,642
I knew that he will react like this.

280
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:40,543
But no problem,

281
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:42,872
I will go to account section,

282
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:46,108
and bring that file to him,
then we will leave.

283
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,913
Till then candy will be free.

284
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,244
You wait outside.

285
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,005
Look! I have got audition.
Come at 7.30.

286
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,630
Take one will be mine
and take two will be yours.

287
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,042
He is showing your anger on me,

288
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,315
Madam! Where are you?

289
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,017
Candy took Vasu to hospital.
Hospital? What happened?

290
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,553
Vasu felt down while he was having
coffee, He got an head injury.

291
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,351
I was trying you phone,
Where is my phone?

292
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,325
I think I forgot in canteen,
I will bring it.

293
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,250
Candy! Why you didn't told me
on phone.

294
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,185
I couldn't tell you on phone.

295
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,227
I don't understand what
are you saying.

296
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,427
Which milk was in Vasu's coffee.

297
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,132
That was this poison.

298
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,479
What we discussed to kill him,
you didn't hear that.

299
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,324
What are you doing?

300
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:12,752
He is my father.

301
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,291
In younger brother's marriage we went
to cracker room to smoke a ciggarette.

302
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,333
Ciggarette didn't light up
but crackers lighten up.

303
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,001
And what should I tell you,
Blast was very huge,

304
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,708
that he lost his both ears.

305
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:29,269
Today is his operation.
I am sorry if he bothered you.

306
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,716
Let's go to doctor and we will tell him
that I gave him poision by mistake.

307
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,556
Where is Hardik?

308
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,516
He is in emergency.

309
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,681
You were unconscious because of
head injury.

310
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,281
I felt from chair.

311
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,853
You head is swelling,

312
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,095
Get his MRI and CT scan,
yes doctor.

313
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,228
I don't need them,

314
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,526
CT scan is here.

315
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,766
Make it fast.

316
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,109
Sir! It's an emergency case.

317
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,406
Please stay outside.

318
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:51,927
I am here.

319
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,656
You don't worry,
I won't move from here.

320
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,803
How did police know?

321
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,500
I hope he is not dead.

322
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,379
What nonsense?

323
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,381
He came closer to her,

324
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,350
Radha quit the job,

325
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,056
But he still called her,

326
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,857
But my hardik bro think Radha is
his sister,

327
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,261
Calling her sister he touched her
everywhere.

328
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,801
You don't know anything,

329
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,234
My Poor Hardik don't touch me so
why would he touch you.

330
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,374
But he touched me,

331
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,844
I don't believe you,

332
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,113
I will call to him and I will
talk to him,

333
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,738
Look! You don't move,

334
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,574
After few moments you will
feel relax.

335
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,411
Look at this sister's daughter.

336
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,329
Hardik! You hold Radha like this.

337
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,231
He got an asthma attack,

338
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,778
your husband is character less.

339
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,675
He also tried to flert with me,

340
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,452
Tell me what to do.

341
00:30:58,823 --> 00:30:59,983
I will tell you.

342
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,623
A guy who lived in slums
his name is Thapa.

343
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,592
He is a real goon,

344
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:10,423
His aunty Phoolan Bai runs a NGO.

345
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,363
It's private social service.

346
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,699
They reform men like Hardik,

347
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,639
And fees in only 15000.

348
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,003
I don't care for fees.

349
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,511
Then call them right now,

350
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,215
No! I was thinking,

351
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,283
that I should give another chance
to HArdik Brother.

352
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,782
May be he will be reform,

353
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,882
He will reform,

354
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,260
Reform...

355
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,797
otherwise you will pass on,

356
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,174
Listen! It's time now,

357
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,441
I think we should go and see
what's going on,

358
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,940
Let's tell the truth to doctor,

359
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,306
So he could treat him well.

360
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,453
What happen?

361
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,364
We will find the right reason
after the post mortem,

362
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,698
But it seems poisoning case because
his body is getting blue.

363
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,983
If they will start hardik's postmortem,

364
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,584
the they will find out

365
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,925
that his coffee was poisoned.

366
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,925
Police won't find out that you
gave him coffee.

367
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,165
Entire office knew that Mansi
made coffee for him,

368
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,837
Let's do one thing.

369
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,133
Let's disappear the body,

370
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,243
Postmortem will be postporn.

371
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,676
But how we will do that.

372
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,204
What media persons are doing here?
Let's go downstairs and check.

373
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,544
You go downstairs and get the car.

374
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,984
You go!

375
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,670
How is your heart problem?
Heart?

376
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,843
I don't have heart problem,

377
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,311
Don't take it on heart you will
get heart problem,

378
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,701
I will be right back.

379
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,682
Take her to emergency.

380
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,597
Follow that car.

381
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,232
Stop some sea side

382
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,263
and let's through the dead body.

383
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,041
Nobody will know,

384
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:13,869
Listen to me,

385
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:18,011
Just tie the dead body with some
baloon and leave it to fly,

386
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,849
Make it fast,
what are you doing?

387
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,263
Dead body is disappeared from hospital.

388
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,188
We are looking for that.
Take out the car.

389
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,576
I will handle it.

390
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,060
We don't want to buy,

391
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,494
I am not sitting to open a shop.

392
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,289
It's not for sale.

393
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,403
This instrument is to measure
for alcohol.

394
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,040
If you will be drunk then
it will flash a light.

395
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:21,745
Open your mouth.

396
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,923
You are not drunk.

397
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,155
So shall we leave.

398
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:54,970
My father's name is Komal.

399
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,310
Is he a woman?

400
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,779
My mom's name is Nojot.
So is she a man,

401
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,518
My brother's name is Suman so
why I can't be Madan,

402
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,602
you learn to drive here.

403
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,452
Whose body you have brought?

404
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,687
Whose dead body we have brought?

405
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,854
He must be feeling bad,

406
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,262
you have crossed the limit of huminity.

407
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,490
He is a dead body and he
don't mind anything.

408
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,067
How we will go to hospital.
We are out of petrol.

409
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,569
Taxi!
And what we will tell to taxi driver?

410
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,603
We will tell him that Sat's father
gone unconscious,

411
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:01,743
and we are taking him to hospital.

412
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,454
Sat! You stay here candy
you come with me,

413
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,155
Try to understand I will talk to them,

414
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,828
Do you have light?

415
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,154
Who is he?

416
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,486
Rocky! You go home,
I will talk to you there,

417
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,632
I should go home?

418
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,792
Someone robbed my private bank,

419
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,371
and you are telling me to go home,

420
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,837
Remove your hand from my
fixed deposit,

421
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,379
If you won't remove your hand
then I will raise my hand,

422
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,573
Taxi is empty?

423
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,269
Sir! We found the dead body,

424
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,041
you never seen a man,

425
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,396
Behave like nothing happened,

426
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,397
Madam! I am telling you stop,

427
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,107
you are getting nervous like
you have seen ghost.

428
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,710
Where are you going?

429
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,116
What happen?

430
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,361
Let's sit in my cabin?
You like coffee.

431
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,261
We like tea,

432
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,996
you haven't tried Mansi's coffee.

433
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,471
She make killer coffee.

434
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,433
But...

435
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:03,810
without milk for me,

436
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,013
What do you think?

437
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,276
We won't have any problem?
It will be done,

438
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,623
I will find out this sinner,

439
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,996
And I will get him punishment like...

440
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,332
his soul will be shock,

441
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:30,172
Inspector Eagle's hands are
longer than law.

442
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,499
Nobody escaped from my hand,

443
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,625
Now get ready to go to jail.

444
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,321
This case...

445
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,519
is become a challenge for me,

446
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,900
We will have to go jail.

447
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,028
Boss is calling you,

448
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:08,139
you have tried well to cry
on my funeral.

449
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,574
But I am sorry,

450
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,077
I survived.

451
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,981
Whatever happened,
that was by mistake.

452
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:21,079
Entire office knew that only you
served me coffee,

453
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,419
and entire office also knew,

454
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,184
that how much you hate me,

455
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,628
yesterday in lunch hour you three
made a plan to kill me,

456
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,956
and the witness is Miss. Tania.

457
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,364
After that you gave me poison in
coffee and after that...

458
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,564
you tried to hide my dead body,

459
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,265
whose witness is this mobile.

460
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,074
You are also in close up.

461
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,687
If there is someone between three of
you and prison,

462
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,926
I can save you to go to jail.

463
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,226
But I have a condition.

464
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,090
You three of all have to go with me.

465
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,934

00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:13,971
