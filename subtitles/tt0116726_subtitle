1
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:41,788
Back!
- Let us in!

2
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:53,661
Scam! What I have done,
that old age took my son?

3
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:57,404
Why did you do?

4
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:01,999
If you knew what grief
would not have left me a widow!

5
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:06,741
Now I cry, but laugh
when they hang!

6
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:11,246
And your family like mine,
will live happily ever after!

7
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:27,676
After testimony
the court concluded

8
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:31,536
Ram and that the driver
his wife Sita,

9
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,809
government stole gold
stored in the train.

10
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:41,647
Ram killed 4 persons and security guards
ONP. Driver and zhel. Keeper.

11
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:45,997
To support her husband
in crime

12
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:51,287
Seth goes to court two years
solitary confinement.

13
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:56,730
A Ram, an employee of the State
lure of gold

14
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:59,736
and mercilessly killed many people

15
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:04,539
court sentenced to death
by hanging.

16
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,706
No!

17
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:13,416
This is a lie... deception, trap!
This is not justice!

18
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:16,717
Justice repeats
presented his lies!

19
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,922
Whose line? What next?

20
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,764
Man sentenced to death
does not care any order!

21
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,993
Offend the court and justice!

22
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:32,703
This truth offends justice
and honesty!

23
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:36,530
Justice does not put a noose,
around the neck of an innocent man!

24
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:43,241
Does the same with his wife,
and yet his unborn child!

25
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:49,349
Only the artist is entitled
make a woman a widow!

26
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:55,357
And now you have it appropriated
and he became God!

27
00:03:55,461 --> 00:04:01,363
Bravo, my land!
How big is your justice!

28
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:04,265
Today, over all in this court

29
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,798
I swear on my mangalsutra
in my sindur,

30
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:11,807
when after 2 years
out of prison

31
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:16,380
will completely destroy the demons

32
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:22,243
why my innocent man
will be hanged!

33
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:29,284
You wrote the fate of my child
before I was born!

34
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:33,959
Write and my death sentence
the pen for justice!

35
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:39,264
To avoid losing court time
after 2 years!

36
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:48,304
Remember my face...
Remember me!

37
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:14,394
Get out of my way, officer!

38
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,559
The law has condemned me
to be hanged!

39
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:21,406
One murder would be without
important for me!

40
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:27,307
Who is afraid of death
not wear a uniform.

41
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:32,243
Instead of hats, police officers like me
shroud wear on their heads.

42
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:38,417
To be punished
criminals like you!

43
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:34,263
Take it! - Officer,
I wanted to prove his innocence!

44
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,873
But you throw me again
in the jaws of death!

45
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:41,877
If one innocent man die
your life will be cursed!

46
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:46,950
Neither will live or die
Relax!

47
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:51,386
Thank you, God!

48
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:55,152
You're so good!
You give me everything!

49
00:08:55,428 --> 00:09:01,526
I have everything - cars,
houses, servants.

50
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:07,464
Of those years I missed
only woman and you sent it to me!

51
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:10,241
Right?

52
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,843
Forgive me, Lord!
I will rape this girl!

53
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:21,086
I know that rape is a sin.

54
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:28,257
But if I did not rape her,
how she will call for help?

55
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:31,995
Will you call me?

56
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:40,262
When you come to her aid
will prichistya from all your sins.

57
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:45,933
Do not be scared..
God is with me!

58
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:51,408
Who interrupts my moment
pleasure?

59
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:56,948
Boss, I am Shiva.
- Why the hell are you calling?

60
00:09:57,156 --> 00:10:01,456
You told me to call in 5.
- Okay. Where's Billa?

61
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,455
Where did he go?

62
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:15,306
Billa fun with my girl,
she became his weakness.

63
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:19,508
Let him die! Listen...
Our path is now clear.

64
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:24,973
Tell Billa immediately went
gold in the cellar in Bashan.

65
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:29,382
What? - The boss wants to go
as gold for Vassal.

66
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,328
Where's Billa?
- Said to one hour will come.

67
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:52,341
Hurry up and open locks
my destiny!

68
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:06,915
Where is the gold?
- I do not know, maybe Billa behind it.

69
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:10,389
I will bring this motherfucker
with gold!

70
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:17,366
Even if your spirit will not come
from here! Sudir, find Billa!

71
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,530
Search everywhere!
I want gold at any price!

72
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,041
Bravo, Billa!
How Chakradari only mislead!

73
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:38,713
Before his men to catch us,
to flee away.

74
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:53,663
Lord, give me everything
except a child.

75
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:58,740
So many years they pray for that
but you do not hear me.

76
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:05,349
If I can not give him a child
might stumbles and sins.

77
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,619
What are you doing?
- Re late even now.

78
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:14,122
Morning I said that we should
to go to the "templing".

79
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:17,784
For God's sake, stop this English!
- Why? Is it wrong "templing"?

80
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:21,364
Absolutely! What "templing"?
- How can it be wrong?

81
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,969
When you go to shop
called shopping.

82
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,462
And when you go to church,
can it be "templing"?

83
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:32,768
You are hurt!

84
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:35,105
Ramush, Shankar!
Bring first aid kit!

85
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,441
Nothing wrong with me!
- Shut up! Will call the doctor!

86
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,178
Just a little scratch
While holding a criminal.

87
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:46,950
Call it a scratch?
- Why so expensive sari breaking?

88
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,391
Once you are alive and well, will you buy
50 more such sari.

89
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:54,462
May God give you 100 years life.

90
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,465
Leave work to the policeman
Why not become a lawyer

91
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,299
as my brother in law?
- As you Devereaux?

92
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:03,471
He is a lawyer by name only.

93
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:06,975
Until now its not a case
which reached the courts.

94
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:10,975
It governs all matters
the street!

95
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:17,554
Thank you, sir, let
and your children are happy.

96
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:39,538
What offended me?

97
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,838
I!

98
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:50,845
If you know who I am
would not make that mistake!

99
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:57,021
Now tell me - who are you?

100
00:13:57,229 --> 00:14:02,360
You hit me!
Within 24 hours will tell you who I am!

101
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:06,865
Where hurry, madam?
You tell me within 24 hours

102
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:10,098
but I for 24 seconds
I will tell you who and what you are!

103
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:13,572
You're spoiled, rampant
daughter of a rich man.

104
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:18,545
And I well know how to bridle
these wild mares!

105
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:23,615
See that? For the poor,
This bread is like a ray of hope.

106
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,723
You spit venom
wealth on him!

107
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:29,617
Now you'll eat!
- No, no!

108
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:34,595
Eat or shove it in your throat!

109
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,917
What is it, madam?
- Shut up!

110
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,427
What did you do with yourself?

111
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:08,760
You want to prove
lotus that grows only in the mud.

112
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:13,429
I have not fallen in the mud
He pushed me into it!

113
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:17,503
Who?
- Lawyer Ajay Bahadur!

114
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,268
How dare it is!
Gangu! Ragout!

115
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:26,277
Cut the arms, which
My daughter was hit in the mud

116
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:29,682
and throw them at her feet!

117
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,789
Until then, I will not drink
even a drop of water!

118
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:36,621
I will take care of him,
you go!

119
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:41,660
Go and show him
Chakradari real person!

120
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:45,079
Ark 's ready!

121
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:14,903
Shame! He alone can defeat you!

122
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:19,584
Madame, it is not a goat, a lion.

123
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:23,015
It is not a lawyer, and fire!

124
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:27,181
Not Empty gasoline in the fire
or burn!

125
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:55,451
You?
- Yes, I!

126
00:19:55,754 --> 00:20:00,054
What is this theater?
- To approach you.

127
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:05,829
Always get what they please.
- Even if not a dream!

128
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:10,228
Haughtily girl like you
can never come into my life.

129
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:13,571
You break my arrogance
at our first meeting.

130
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:16,840
Since then, my heart beats
just for you, Ajay.

131
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:19,737
See for yourself if you do not believe me.

132
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:23,244
Let me go!

133
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:25,913
I will not let you go!

134
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:16,266
Sir, forgive me!
I made a mistake!

135
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:19,737
I will not hang with the girls again!
- I will punish you,

136
00:26:19,804 --> 00:26:25,436

To look at girl!

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,940
Sir, forgive him!
This is my son.

Is your son

139
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:39,254
Arjun Verma sees only a criminal,

00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:41,955
Dilip Singh!
- Yes, sir?

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Shave his head, smutty
his face, Tie him to a donkey

00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:49,993
and show it to the Girls' College!

00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:52,295
Wait!
Get not one, but two donkeys.

144

Who are you? - I do not know?
You're the biggest loser!

145
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:58,573
Worldwide, there are only two Chakradari.

Why are you here?
- To see your great justice.

universe is in your body

Now I want to hear the sentence
brother of the head.

Who do you speak?
- For your brother Ajay.

00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:28,502
He tried to rape my daughter.
- This is a lie!

155
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:32,240
What evidence do you have?
- You want proof?

00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:36,002
Here's the proof!

and your honor will be under my feet!

164
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:30,860
Stop the anger and come to eat.

165
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:34,263
Eating or you will cool down.
- For God's sake, shut up!

166
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:37,469
Kakko, such as hunger,
he himself would sit down to eat.

167
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,404
Are not you ashamed?

168
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:41,938

00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:48,612
Like dignity, food
is also required for all.

171
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,998
Kakko, give me bread.
- Why are you harassing this girl?

172
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:59,087
I told you that, not me
a girl bullied me.

173
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:04,428
So it? Only see his face!
- Look, Sister!

174
00:29:04,636 --> 00:29:07,730
It's so beautiful! Right?

175
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:14,634
Ajay, you're my brother.
I can hide some of your mistakes.

176
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:17,371
But if they show these pictures
tomorrow in court

177
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:21,443
we will be disgraced,
and your life - destroyed.

178
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:23,320
Brother, this is the difference
between you and me.

179
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,648
You only see the visible things.

180
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:28,155
And I see and invisible.

181
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,991
We live together, but our engagement
between law and justice continues.

182
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:35,965
Now sit down and eat.

183
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:41,197
I will cut my head, but no
To give your bent in shame.

184
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:44,938
But tomorrow...
- Something unusual will happen in court.

185
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,997
I will put the father,
and daughter on the spot.

186
00:29:48,012 --> 00:29:52,672
Now sit down and eat!
- I can only eat if you give me.

187
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:56,142
Today will feed my brother
with their own hands.

188
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:02,486
See? If you do not eat, I will stay
hungry! - I will give you.

189
00:30:31,823 --> 00:30:33,189
Who is it?

190
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,027
Who are you?

191
00:30:44,402 --> 00:30:47,929
You? How did you get here?
- I can go anywhere!

192
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:51,198
Why do my pictures?
- Tooth for tooth!

193
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:54,396
Your father and you shoot me,

194
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:57,738
to prove in court
I tried to rape them.

195
00:30:57,749 --> 00:31:03,410
I made these pictures to tell
truth in court. - I will not say it!

196
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:07,721
Then you naked pictures will be
published in tomorrow's newspapers

197
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:10,458
and suspended in booths.

198
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:14,459
Give me the negatives,
will withdraw the case!

199
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:18,827
Never retire if
sentence will be decided

200
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:23,233
in court tomorrow morning!

201
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:31,438
Ajay Bahadur, are charged
in the attempted rape of Miss Madu.

202
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:34,316
You say something in defense?

203
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:39,746
I'm a lawyer and would like permission
to defend in my case.

204
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:53,426
Can you tell the court when
and how you tried to rape?

205
00:31:55,807 --> 00:32:00,676
Any decent girl will not say
things to many people!

206
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:06,413
The photos shown in court
are living proof

207
00:32:06,484 --> 00:32:08,809
for decency Miss Madu.

208
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,119
Decent girl will not shoot
her rape.

209
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,220
Neither will show such
vulgar pictures in court.

210
00:32:20,164 --> 00:32:25,796
Miss Madu, tell the truth!
I took your honor?

211
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:31,970
Speak!

212
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:40,716
Mr. Judge, unless he wanted, how can
I did? - Speak clearly!

213
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:46,992
Ajay cried alone to check it out.
- What to check?

214
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:52,657
I wanted to see whether it is suitable
the first wedding night.

215
00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:56,826
My God, is so shameless!

216
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:03,832
This means that I am not your
done something improper.

217
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,707
I behaved indecently,
but have not received anything.

218
00:33:07,712 --> 00:33:10,879
Mr. Judge, see
photos closely.

219
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:14,210
Not he, but I do everything.

220
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:17,945
What are you doing?
- I tried to kiss him.

221
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:23,518
What can you say?
I thought it rape!

222
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,667
It must be a child
indecent man! - Yes.

223
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:36,229
Hear
Miss Madu, the court concluded

224
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,500
Miss Madu needs
psychological treatment.

225
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:44,578
Chakradari Chouduri warns

226
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:49,879
not involved nevermore
court with such counterfeiting cases.

227
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:55,520
Since the accusation against
Ajay Bahadur is false,

228
00:33:55,593 --> 00:34:01,395
court removed the accusation from him.

229
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:11,404
Before you throw mud on others
better protect their honor.

230
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:14,210
Then maybe not
be so disgraced.

231
00:34:14,278 --> 00:34:17,679
There's still time to fix.

232
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:21,744
Everything is fine at home!

233
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:26,014
No one speaks English
out to me a shame! Come on!

234
00:34:32,063 --> 00:34:36,727
I did what I said.
Give me back my pictures.

235
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:41,429
Never back what
I like it. - So?

236
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:45,105
But you said I will come back
photos.

237
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,243
I put them back if they have.
- You are a liar!

238
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:54,383
I know very well that trying
blackmailed me!

239
00:34:55,987 --> 00:35:02,989
Never ransom girls
them do nude photos.

240
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:06,989
In our family, not stripping
The girl's honor and protect it.

241
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:14,370
There was no tape in the camera.
- What? - Look!

242
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:20,967
It was a farce like this
that you and your dad played out.

243
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:27,850
If you want to win something in life
and learn to lose.

244
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:31,021
If you want to go straight
and learn to bend.

245
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:34,989
If you want to win,
and learn to lose.

246
00:35:35,026 --> 00:35:37,353
God made you so beautiful.

247
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:44,164
If your soul is so beautiful
your life will be fine.

248
00:35:54,378 --> 00:35:59,509
"If you want to win something in life
and learn to lose."

249
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:02,845
"If you want to go straight
and learn to bend."

250
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:07,252
"If you want to win,
and learn to lose."

251
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:09,584
"God made you so beautiful."

252
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:14,527
"If your soul is so beautiful
your life will be fine."

253
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,191
"God made you so beautiful."

254
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:23,131
"If your soul is so beautiful
your life will be fine."

255
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,789
Who is it?

256
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,493
"I tried to kiss him."

257
00:36:46,764 --> 00:36:48,732
You?
- Ajay at home?

258
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:50,901
Why?
- The important work.

259
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:54,833
Sit down, will now call it.

260
00:36:55,773 --> 00:37:00,801
Shameless girl, now they
fix! Where's the broom?

261
00:37:05,116 --> 00:37:09,075
What are you doing here?
- I came to ask for forgiveness.

262
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:12,752
This is a new way Is it?
- Do not get me wrong.

263
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:16,890
Now I have another Madu,
Geek not uppity.

264
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:23,599
Will live and die
just for you.

265
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:34,100
Where is this witch?

266
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:37,447
What happened?
- Rape him!

267
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:41,015
To me?
- Then close your eyes!

268
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:46,849
Oh, God! As for the bad times!

269
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:50,419
Where was gone?

270
00:43:07,578 --> 00:43:09,474
Not eaten anything for several days.

271
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:12,750
If you continue to be stubborn,
your life will be in danger.

272
00:43:12,817 --> 00:43:17,618
So what?
I do not want to live.

273
00:43:17,922 --> 00:43:24,159
You would not know that the experience
suicide is a crime.

274
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:28,189
Then punish me, tamnicharyu.

275
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:33,463
I do not want to live in a world
managed by the injustice.

276
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:36,304
We will be unable to convince her.

277
00:43:36,508 --> 00:43:43,971
You should bring her husband,
maybe he'll do it.

278
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,002
You?

279
00:44:27,892 --> 00:44:32,261
No, Seth... do not cry.

280
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:42,699
Do not cry... look at me.
Why refuse to eat?

281
00:44:43,408 --> 00:44:47,967
Every Indian woman
wants to die before her husband.

282
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:55,044
But you want the other
to live as a widow?

283
00:44:57,255 --> 00:45:00,723
Before you were not so selfish.

284
00:45:01,091 --> 00:45:04,050
Think of us.

285
00:45:04,596 --> 00:45:10,364
But do not think about what
grows slowly in your body.

286
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:16,070
Did you want to kill your child
before it is born?

287
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:19,342
What will this
lousy world?

288
00:45:19,444 --> 00:45:24,313
I'll call child
a thief and a murderer.

289
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:28,074
Instead of living such
miserable life

290
00:45:28,286 --> 00:45:31,380
My child will be better
not come into this world.

291
00:45:31,956 --> 00:45:34,584
I admit that we did
unfair.

292
00:45:34,959 --> 00:45:39,589
But not as much as
Devaki and Vasudeva with.

293
00:45:44,736 --> 00:45:47,261
Even then she was born Krishna.

294
00:45:47,472 --> 00:45:51,340
You should also bear
this child, Seth.

295
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:54,109
Instead of "Ramayana" and "Mahabharata"

296
00:45:54,412 --> 00:45:57,137
caused him to tell us
atrocities.

297
00:45:57,148 --> 00:46:00,977
He must be brave and when
grow up to tell the world

298
00:46:00,985 --> 00:46:04,985
how was hanged innocent father.

299
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:07,822
How the life of his mother
was destroyed.

300
00:46:08,993 --> 00:46:12,121
You must live, Seth!

301
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:17,799
You must be born Krishna!

302
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:30,147
Get...

303
00:46:30,682 --> 00:46:34,140
Will not you fill
my last wish?

304
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:36,987
Eat...

305
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:05,346
Stop! Shiva, you have more time!
Tell me where is gold!

306
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:10,852
Otherwise you will beg me to die

307
00:47:11,055 --> 00:47:15,515
and will fit in agony!
Where is the gold?

308
00:47:15,727 --> 00:47:20,187
Boss, tell the truth!
I do not know where the gold!

309
00:47:20,398 --> 00:47:23,697
So you do not know? Sudir!

310
00:47:26,738 --> 00:47:33,541
No! Do not kill me!

311
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:49,727
Son!

312
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:17,848
Disappeared years ago!
I do not know anything about you. Where are you?

313
00:48:18,122 --> 00:48:23,583
Maybe... No!

314
00:48:23,795 --> 00:48:28,927
Can not be!

315
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:36,502
God, please protect my child!

316
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:44,112
Take my life if you want,
but let my son live long!

317
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:49,215
I want nothing!

318
00:48:53,156 --> 00:48:54,783
Uncle!
- What?

319
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:58,587
He is dead! Now who will tell us
Gold?

320
00:48:59,496 --> 00:49:01,896
Someone else.

321
00:49:02,165 --> 00:49:05,601
What it is dead?
Billa is still alive.

322
00:49:05,936 --> 00:49:11,602
That bastard can not escape
nor to sell gold to someone.

323
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:15,307
Get rid of his body!

324
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:46,002
God, if my son had died
in your will,

325
00:49:46,543 --> 00:49:50,570
I would cry!

326
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:57,650
But his killer is Chakradari,
not you!

327
00:49:58,221 --> 00:50:03,022
Chakradari will not spare you!

328
00:50:07,564 --> 00:50:09,361
The child is very beautiful.

329
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:13,332
And the mole on right cheek
a happy place.

330
00:50:14,004 --> 00:50:18,202
Sakar, you got a cigarette?
Sister!

331
00:50:19,743 --> 00:50:22,041
What?
- Everything OK in there? - Yes.

332
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:24,713
Perform their duties
or complain! - God!

333
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:28,384
It is a ball of fire!
- We will burn to ashes!

334
00:50:31,922 --> 00:50:34,117
Instead of "Ramayana and Mahabharata

335
00:50:34,324 --> 00:50:36,792
caused him to tell us
atrocities.

336
00:50:37,027 --> 00:50:40,793
He must be brave and when
grow up to tell the world

337
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:45,400
how was hanged innocent father.

338
00:50:45,602 --> 00:50:49,561
How the life of his mother
was destroyed.

339
00:50:52,843 --> 00:50:55,944
Sakar, how I sin
I have done in previous lives,

340
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:59,074
that should keep thieves!

341
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:02,819
Hey!

342
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,816
What is this?
- Could be a bomb!

343
00:51:06,056 --> 00:51:09,423
Today detonate bombs anywhere.

344
00:51:09,626 --> 00:51:12,823
This really is a bomb!
Get quick!

345
00:51:13,063 --> 00:51:15,497
If it blows, we break
in pieces!

346
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:19,829
You have to throw in the yard.
- Right.

347
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,562
Slowly... may explode.

348
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:35,607
This is a toy. Astray.
- They made fools of us.

349
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,049
Has escaped!

350
00:51:42,993 --> 00:51:45,791
Where was gone?

351
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:01,807
They waited so long!
Where were you?

352
00:52:02,012 --> 00:52:07,314
I... - Do not be afraid
rentgenat not a transaction.

353
00:52:07,684 --> 00:52:11,484
Nothing will happen
with your child.

354
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,992
Where was gone?
- I do not understand...

355
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:20,488
Here somewhere!

356
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:22,999
Here it is!
- Grab it!

357
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:25,493
Stop!

358
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:37,846
Where'd you go?
- Here it is!

359
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:54,356
Well we sort!
What trouble!

360
00:52:54,564 --> 00:52:57,533
Where was gone?
- Why ask me? Let's go!

361
00:52:57,734 --> 00:52:59,531
Neither doctors
or sisters know!

362
00:52:59,736 --> 00:53:02,705
Even those officers do not know
where the woman escaped!

363
00:53:02,906 --> 00:53:06,273
Baby Do not ask where
His mother is gone?

364
00:53:09,646 --> 00:53:13,207
I think Seth has only one
reason to escape from the hospital.

365
00:53:13,516 --> 00:53:17,384
Probably went to find
gold, hidden by her husband

366
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:22,885
Search the city and find
gold before her!

367
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:27,427
No need to go anywhere
she herself will come to me.

368
00:53:27,431 --> 00:53:30,759
Why such a dangerous woman
will return to the police?

369
00:53:30,768 --> 00:53:35,996
Even dangerous woman becomes
weak because of her child.

370
00:53:36,107 --> 00:53:40,273
God can forget her child,
but not the mother.

371
00:53:40,444 --> 00:53:43,971
If you allow me, I would like
take the child with him.

372
00:53:44,215 --> 00:53:48,083
Mother's love will bring her to me

373
00:53:48,452 --> 00:53:52,252
I'll bust
effortlessly.

374
00:54:05,236 --> 00:54:08,132
Come! What you wear,
wrapped in the towel?

375
00:54:08,139 --> 00:54:12,969
I brought you a toy.
- Toy? Show me!

376
00:54:13,477 --> 00:54:16,537
Child? Give it to me!

377
00:54:16,914 --> 00:54:20,441
What a beautiful child!

378
00:54:20,985 --> 00:54:25,615
For me it bring?
Oh, thank you very much!

379
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,924
Whose is this child?
- Moe.

380
00:54:29,593 --> 00:54:33,620
Looks like a royal blue.
- No.

381
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:37,627
He is the son of a prisoner,

382
00:54:38,002 --> 00:54:40,129
which left him in hospital
and fled.

383
00:54:40,504 --> 00:54:44,304
And whose child was,
is now mine.

384
00:54:44,508 --> 00:54:49,946
So you will love it...
- A mild, Lakshmi!

385
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:55,144
Should not be tied
so much to him.

386
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:59,319
Once you find his mother
will have to return it to her.

387
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:01,989
You will not find his mother!
- Why not?

388
00:55:02,193 --> 00:55:05,890
I will pray for all
33 million gods

389
00:55:06,197 --> 00:55:11,658
police found his mother
and it stayed with me.

390
00:55:12,036 --> 00:55:15,995
Come, my little!

391
00:55:34,325 --> 00:55:38,521
Who are you?
- By profession I headset.

392
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:44,031
Do not be frightened.
I know all about you.

393
00:55:44,235 --> 00:55:48,001
So they hid from police
and they brought you here.

394
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:54,371
Like your husband, and I am punished
without fault.

395
00:55:55,346 --> 00:56:05,722
Maybe the criminals
I hanged and one innocent.

396
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:12,023
So my only son
was killed.

397
00:56:12,596 --> 00:56:19,058
But the one who killed him
was not God. Was this beast!

398
00:56:27,278 --> 00:56:34,411
If the law is arrested,
will hang him with his own hands.

399
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:40,314
But the hands of that bastard
are longer than the law.

400
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:44,058
I will cut his long arms
and shorten them!

401
00:56:44,728 --> 00:56:50,360
Will put a noose around his neck,
before my husband is hanged!

402
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:58,775
Hello, Mr. Chakradari!

403
00:57:12,156 --> 00:57:14,125
Seth... you?
- Yes, I!

404
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,628
Where is that scoundrel who
commit murder,

405
00:57:24,001 --> 00:57:28,301
and condemned my husband? Speak!
- I'll tell you!

406
00:57:28,672 --> 00:57:31,800
Do not let go!
Kill the scum!

407
00:57:32,076 --> 00:57:36,809
The hidden gold?
Speak, dog!

408
00:57:38,015 --> 00:57:39,983
Speak!

409
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:50,994
Get her!

410
00:58:07,044 --> 00:58:09,171
Here it is! Get her!

411
00:58:39,243 --> 00:58:42,972
What happened? Men in the city
not have died,

412
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,048
that fight with a woman?
- Get out!

413
00:58:45,249 --> 00:58:48,548
Or will they break?
- I'm not a pot, to break me?

414
00:58:48,752 --> 00:58:51,991
You get out, eunuch!
- Called me a eunuch? Dirty...

415
00:58:55,759 --> 00:59:00,128
You're lucky! Today is
birthday of Mahatma Gandhi.

416
00:59:00,431 --> 00:59:03,400
And today at 12:00 will not raise
hand against anyone.

417
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:08,898
There are 3 more minutes. You can call me
beaten and take it.

418
00:59:09,273 --> 00:59:13,209
But when the bell
starting at 12:00 to beat,

419
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:18,810
shall deal with all
until the last bell!

420
01:02:06,617 --> 01:02:07,985
Come on!

421
01:02:11,622 --> 01:02:19,324
I never... - Do not worry,
will help you. Who were those?

422
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:22,758
Enemies of a defenseless woman.

423
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:28,400
So you're new in town? - Yes.
- Where will you go now?

424
01:02:29,306 --> 01:02:34,369
Looking for work? Can you
to take care of a newborn?

425
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:36,940
Your child?
- No, not mine.

426
01:02:37,314 --> 01:02:39,989
Yesterday I took my daughter to take care
baby from the hospital.

427
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:43,910
The hospital?
- Yes, his mother was a prisoner.

428
01:02:43,987 --> 01:02:47,518
Maintaining the child in hospital
and ran away.

429
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:56,927
Well, sir, will take care of it
as for my child. - Come with me.

430
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:02,136
I know you do not like
milk powder.

431
01:03:02,339 --> 01:03:07,471
But where do you take milk?
Quiet...

432
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:10,144
Come...

433
01:03:10,781 --> 01:03:13,278
Quiet...

434
01:03:25,362 --> 01:03:29,162
Kakko, who see you lead.
- Who is she?

435
01:03:29,366 --> 01:03:32,494
Maid. From today it
will take care of the child.

436
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:38,440
Hello.
- Watch a baby before?

437
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:41,442
Then calm my son.

438
01:03:55,058 --> 01:03:59,358
You're great!
- So it passed your test?

439
01:03:59,563 --> 01:04:02,395
Not yet. I want to ask her
a few more questions.

440
01:04:02,399 --> 01:04:06,199
What is your name?
- Savitri.

441
01:04:06,737 --> 01:04:08,964
Why hesitate to say
herself?

442
01:04:09,072 --> 01:04:14,032
Poor woman is abandoned
her husband.

443
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:17,136
It is so worried.
- All men are.

444
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:20,547
Leaving their wives and polishing
sandals of other women.

445
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:25,681
Does it make sense to blame him
when my luck is bad?

446
01:04:25,756 --> 01:04:31,524
Do not worry. Make yourself
home and considered my own son.

447
01:04:32,262 --> 01:04:36,221
I will love him as my child.

448
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:39,991
And another thing: never
to show my husband.

449
01:04:40,103 --> 01:04:43,903
She thinks my brother quickly
urochasva women.

450
01:04:44,441 --> 01:04:46,569
This is my brother.

451
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:56,908
Whatever you say will not be shown
before him. - Come inside.

452
01:04:57,521 --> 01:05:00,051
Come on!

453
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:03,587
Who are these people?
- Tried to rape a woman.

454
01:05:03,794 --> 01:05:06,922
We arrived on time
and got them.

455
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:12,161
What? I caught them both?

456
01:05:12,536 --> 01:05:15,937
Do not we, these people took them
near bus stop.

457
01:05:16,473 --> 01:05:21,976
Well, you saw a girl
and you look obscure, huh?

458
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:33,016
If you find a dead body somewhere
a girl

459
01:05:33,256 --> 01:05:37,522
save that they raped her
and killed.

460
01:05:37,928 --> 01:05:42,456
Let the bastards in jail to rot
life. - Sir, do not do it.

461
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:48,969
We have not tried to rape her.
- The boss ordered it have brought it to him.

462
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:53,973
Who's your boss?
- Chakradari.

463
01:05:54,845 --> 01:05:59,305
Why is it like to hold it?
- She tried to kill him.

464
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,014
Can you recognize her?
- Yes.

465
01:06:05,922 --> 01:06:09,551
Do any of these is?
- No.

466
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,260
These?
- No.

467
01:06:12,696 --> 01:06:18,498
These?
- Here it is! This is a woman!

468
01:06:27,878 --> 01:06:30,190
Do not cry, son.
Now you will get milk.

469
01:06:41,725 --> 01:06:45,027
No, my son, do not cry.

470
01:06:54,337 --> 01:06:56,864
Where is the child?

471
01:07:00,744 --> 01:07:04,617
Crying, probably hungry.
- Yeah, give it to me.

472
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,217
Do not cry, little one.

473
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:17,223
Drink your milk.

474
01:07:17,594 --> 01:07:23,626
Crying for his mother's milk,
but she has disappeared somewhere.

475
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:29,235
Oh, maybe I sinned
in a previous life

476
01:07:29,439 --> 01:07:32,738
Now that I
nakarmya to her child.

477
01:07:39,616 --> 01:07:40,784
Give it to me.

478
01:12:20,996 --> 01:12:26,525
What? - Ragout and Gangu
have spoken to nach. Verma.

479
01:12:26,735 --> 01:12:32,537
Even make a statement
against me, what?

480
01:12:32,741 --> 01:12:35,107
Can the dogs barking
to kill an elephant?

481
01:12:35,344 --> 01:12:38,711
Do not worry about me
but do so...

482
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:43,984
Here, Mr. Head!

483
01:12:44,253 --> 01:12:48,690
Are you the wrong way today?
- I never confuse.

484
01:12:49,258 --> 01:12:55,390
Stand in front of goal.
- What purpose?

485
01:12:55,597 --> 01:13:00,227
Look at me as a person
in the eyes and talked.

486
01:13:00,602 --> 01:13:04,732
Look in your eyes those
who are my equals.

487
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:09,536
Do not look and talk
small, insignificant people.

488
01:13:12,714 --> 01:13:16,241
I am a loyal soldier
Government of India.

489
01:13:16,618 --> 01:13:19,644
With six inches'm higher than you.

490
01:13:19,955 --> 01:13:22,981
In my hand I stick 45 cm

491
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:25,986
If you get stuck in you

492
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:29,728
it will give all
info inside!

493
01:13:30,299 --> 01:13:33,962
Are you threatening me?
Now we call Commissioner!

494
01:13:36,972 --> 01:13:39,668
Call who you want

495
01:13:39,975 --> 01:13:44,275
but only after answering
my questions. - Ask!

496
01:13:44,813 --> 01:13:47,748
Where were you at 1:00 yesterday?
- In his famous ranch.

497
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:52,679
I ride a horse?
- No mare.

498
01:13:52,988 --> 01:13:57,755
Maybe this is the mare they pushed
and your neck is distorted.

499
01:13:58,093 --> 01:14:01,062
No, pinching nerve during sleep.

500
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:04,493
Did you pinch or
someone you squeeze it?

501
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:10,694
In this city was not born a man
to get to my neck!

502
01:14:11,006 --> 01:14:15,136
But ordinary woman is good to him.
- Woman?

503
01:14:15,344 --> 01:14:18,472
For any woman talking about?
- For the woman

504
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:22,476
that after the birth of her child,
escape from police

505
01:14:22,851 --> 01:14:25,718
to kill.

506
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:27,886
What is your relationship with this woman?

507
01:14:28,123 --> 01:14:30,216
What do you want revenge?

508
01:14:30,459 --> 01:14:33,792
Obviously looking at many Indian films.

509
01:14:34,129 --> 01:14:38,498
So its canard
and you come here.

510
01:14:39,034 --> 01:14:42,800
I'll tell you something very
Indian films.

511
01:14:43,705 --> 01:14:47,732
At the end of the movie hero
beat villain in hell.

512
01:14:48,043 --> 01:14:54,505
Villain runs like a dog,
a hero is still kicking it.

513
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:57,746
So you think you are a hero?

514
01:14:58,053 --> 01:15:01,580
One of my phone call
will become a round zero!

515
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:05,453
Call when presenting
employed by you hooligans

516
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:08,821
tomorrow in court.
- Sudir!

517
01:15:09,398 --> 01:15:13,425
Show outlet it's time to sleep.

518
01:15:16,572 --> 01:15:23,243
Take sleeping pills because
tonight will not sleep.

519
01:15:37,093 --> 01:15:38,161
Come on!

520
01:16:10,627 --> 01:16:13,257
Get down!

521
01:16:46,162 --> 01:16:48,130
Take it!

522
01:16:48,598 --> 01:16:50,566
Lock it!

523
01:17:37,213 --> 01:17:41,980
Yes, I am the mother
this unhappy child.

524
01:17:42,985 --> 01:17:48,685
Constantly keep your child
but I can not call it mine.

525
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:54,996
My name is Savitri and Sita.

526
01:17:55,564 --> 01:18:00,866
Even innocent, continued
to run from the law.

527
01:18:01,069 --> 01:18:05,369
My Ram was not only
separated from me

528
01:18:05,574 --> 01:18:11,012
but was also called
thief and murderer!

529
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:14,947
What watch?
Call your brother

530
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:20,950
let me and arrested me back
back to jail!

531
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:25,384
Let's split from parent her child!

532
01:18:25,694 --> 01:18:28,663
Let's erase this stain
the face of the law!

533
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:32,127
Even if the truth be defeated
by at least will win!

534
01:18:32,367 --> 01:18:36,565
Then what is the truth?
- What will you do it know?

535
01:18:36,938 --> 01:18:39,736
Truth no longer exists
nowadays.

536
01:18:40,008 --> 01:18:43,068
The law has recognized the falsehood
for their child!

537
01:18:43,278 --> 01:18:48,045
I admit that the law does not heart
but has a brother.

538
01:18:48,617 --> 01:18:50,983
A heart does not recognize laws.

539
01:18:51,286 --> 01:18:55,746
Tell me what happened,
so I can help you.

540
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:58,259
Tell me.

541
01:18:58,794 --> 01:19:01,991
We lived very happily
in our small house.

542
01:19:02,297 --> 01:19:08,429
I was pregnant, so my husband
always trying to please me.

543
01:19:10,405 --> 01:19:14,933
One more!
- How will you eat?

544
01:19:15,143 --> 01:19:17,111
Seth should eat everything.

545
01:19:17,312 --> 01:19:21,442
The more apples you eat,
more sanguine will be our son.

546
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:24,016
Right, son?

547
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:26,446
No son, and daughter!
- No, son!

548
01:19:26,655 --> 01:19:30,022
Will first daughter!
- No, I will first son!

549
01:19:30,325 --> 01:19:34,386
If the first born daughter, she
Goddess Lakshmi will bring with him.

550
01:19:34,763 --> 01:19:37,459
It is absolutely right!

551
01:19:37,999 --> 01:19:40,627
Who are you?
- The state of your daughter.

552
01:19:41,002 --> 01:19:44,301
Even before the birth of her
Goddess Lakshmi came to your house.

553
01:19:44,673 --> 01:19:49,042
This is for you.
- Why do we give this money?

554
01:19:49,344 --> 01:19:53,747
Tomorrow morning I will drive
No freight train in 2055 for Poune.

555
01:19:54,015 --> 01:20:00,113
Yes, and? - In one of the wagons
state has a 5 billion gold.

556
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:04,056
You'll have to stop train
18 km before Lonavla,

557
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:07,328
a secluded place for 30 minutes.

558
01:20:07,696 --> 01:20:12,429
We will do the rest.
- What do you think?

559
01:20:12,701 --> 01:20:16,228
He would seduce me with money
and will give their country?

560
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:18,837
That will give you the gold of the people?

561
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,170
Go away or I'll kill you!

562
01:20:22,378 --> 01:20:24,005
Sister, explain it.

563
01:20:24,213 --> 01:20:27,910
Goddess Lakshmi is very welcome
in your home. This is only an advance.

564
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:30,716
After work,
will give him as much money

565
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,388
they will spend the rest
of his life count!

566
01:20:33,389 --> 01:20:36,256
Scam! You came
We bribe?

567
01:20:36,492 --> 01:20:39,188
Get out now or
will call the police!

568
01:20:39,395 --> 01:20:42,523
Go! And do not laugh
to come here again!

569
01:20:46,235 --> 01:20:51,265
What happened? - We
buy it in any way.

570
01:21:11,093 --> 01:21:14,062
Is this the driver of the train?
- Yes.

571
01:21:14,263 --> 01:21:17,290
And she?
- His wife.

572
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,738
All right.

573
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:41,423
Get out!

574
01:21:49,565 --> 01:21:51,533
Get out!

575
01:22:10,586 --> 01:22:16,252
Seth, are you okay?
Who did it?

576
01:22:36,178 --> 01:22:38,147
Leave me!
- Keep it!

577
01:22:42,518 --> 01:22:44,986
Ram, what happens?

578
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:51,527
No!

579
01:23:13,549 --> 01:23:15,517
Rip it!

580
01:23:18,654 --> 01:23:21,350
Stop all this!

581
01:23:26,662 --> 01:23:30,325
Bastards!
- Throw them in the car!

582
01:23:35,571 --> 01:23:37,368
Who is it?

583
01:23:37,573 --> 01:23:42,034
Ram, what are you doing?
- Stealing the gold!

584
01:23:43,913 --> 01:23:45,881
Open it!

585
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:50,714
Bring the truck!

586
01:24:06,268 --> 01:24:09,465
Rushed through the jungle gold
in my bed.

587
01:24:09,705 --> 01:24:13,904
I will take care of police.
- We won, Uncle!

588
01:24:32,394 --> 01:24:38,765
Who did it?
- Ram driver. By greed

589
01:24:39,301 --> 01:24:47,106
cellars and ran us all
gold.

590
01:24:55,751 --> 01:24:58,146
Are you all right, Seth?

591
01:24:59,655 --> 01:25:02,522
As must go
the police.

592
01:25:18,073 --> 01:25:22,134
In the court continued to shout,
that my husband is innocent

593
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:24,479
but nobody believed me.

594
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:30,141
If the law punish the innocent
Ram and Sita,

595
01:25:30,352 --> 01:25:33,446
people will stop to baptize
children or Sita Ram.

596
01:25:33,789 --> 01:25:36,087
When Ram and Sita are in trouble

597
01:25:36,358 --> 01:25:39,384
Hanuman is born necessarily
some form.

598
01:25:39,695 --> 01:25:41,993
Consider me your brother Hanuman.

599
01:25:42,364 --> 01:25:44,361
I promise you, sister,

600
01:25:44,366 --> 01:25:48,962
that until the kingdom of Lanka was burnt
Rabbah of the demon, they tortured,

601
01:25:49,038 --> 01:25:51,496
will not calm down!

602
01:25:55,377 --> 01:26:00,246
Who are you talking about? - With God.
- With God? - Yes.

603
01:26:00,482 --> 01:26:04,111
Told him that if every home
there was a cop like you

604
01:26:04,386 --> 01:26:07,513
crime in the world would
to be destroyed.

605
01:26:09,391 --> 01:26:12,587
Is it true or trying
to crouch?

606
01:26:12,728 --> 01:26:14,423
5050.
- So?

607
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:17,198
No. 1: do not give to do
crimes. - No.

608
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:21,729
No. 2: if a crime
lead man in court.

609
01:26:21,737 --> 01:26:24,235
You do not know whether this man
will do just.

610
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,338
This is not my business.
- It's my job.

611
01:26:27,409 --> 01:26:34,874
Our battle will continue. I fight
the law. - I - for justice.

612
01:26:36,752 --> 01:26:38,549
Come, breakfast is ready!

613
01:26:41,089 --> 01:26:44,616
Hello! Sorry to be delayed
because of my prayers.

614
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:46,622
Say what brings you here.
Hurry

615
01:26:46,861 --> 01:26:49,987
must attend the annual
event at the home of widows.

616
01:26:50,098 --> 01:26:56,469
Soon the rains will begin,
and the roof of the shelter is for repair.

617
01:26:56,771 --> 01:26:59,968
If roof collapse
500 children may die.

618
01:27:00,174 --> 01:27:04,167
Before children die
shall deal with you, Anna!

619
01:27:04,445 --> 01:27:08,142
Children are the future of the nation.
And if something happens to them?

620
01:27:08,516 --> 01:27:13,419
Will send a check. Fill any
any amount, but repair the roof.

621
01:27:13,621 --> 01:27:16,590
You are great!
May God give you long life!

622
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,923
Mr. Sharma, how many times you say

623
01:27:20,128 --> 01:27:22,255
not to come in strong sunlight.

624
01:27:22,463 --> 01:27:26,559
I told you that they will accept your daughter.
- It has already been adopted.

625
01:27:27,468 --> 01:27:31,336
So bring your sweet.
- Trying to bribe me, huh?

626
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:35,942
Really sweet offered to God
are bribe? Please.

627
01:27:36,477 --> 01:27:40,573
You are not man and God!
- He is God and the Devil!

628
01:27:41,482 --> 01:27:44,610
With the power of money
zamazva your eyes

629
01:27:44,819 --> 01:27:47,585
to can not see
His vile person!

630
01:27:47,923 --> 01:27:52,223
Speak respectfully! This is my father!
- It is a criminal!

631
01:27:52,494 --> 01:27:54,821
He had robbed gold
by freight train

632
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:58,527
but it was ordered
Ram innocent driver!

633
01:27:58,834 --> 01:28:03,602
Your father is a thief, smuggler
and a traitor to the nation!

634
01:28:05,674 --> 01:28:09,542
I broke your arm,
if you want, but they love it!

635
01:28:09,845 --> 01:28:11,814
I am bound to my heart!

636
01:28:13,182 --> 01:28:16,640
Rogue! What watch?
Throw it!

637
01:28:38,873 --> 01:28:43,173
If 24 hours does not admit
transgression

638
01:28:43,544 --> 01:28:49,347
and admit Ram innocent,
I'll bury you with gold!

639
01:28:50,986 --> 01:28:55,014
How became aware of gold?
Probably hiding Sita.

640
01:28:58,994 --> 01:29:01,219
So the law in this country
is useless

641
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,897
and in the courts is not dealt
Justice?

642
01:29:02,898 --> 01:29:04,725
All evidence and witnesses
are false?

643
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:07,401
I'm talking about the case
Driver with Ram.

644
01:29:07,403 --> 01:29:10,702
Already announced the verdict,
case closed

645
01:29:10,906 --> 01:29:13,333
and the driver will be hanged
a few days.

646
01:29:13,342 --> 01:29:16,368
Your justice will hang him.

647
01:29:16,578 --> 01:29:19,576
Your law will kill him
Ram because he is innocent.

648
01:29:19,581 --> 01:29:24,382
If innocent, why flee
when he was detained by the police?

649
01:29:24,753 --> 01:29:30,453
No parent, even before death
would not have abandoned her child.

650
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:36,620
But the wife of Ram left child
and fled. You know why?

651
01:29:36,932 --> 01:29:40,459
To take the stolen gold
and live in luxury.

652
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:47,005
Seth ran away not because of wealth,
but to revenge Chakradari.

653
01:29:47,275 --> 01:29:50,574
Because he is the real culprit.
- Who told you that?

654
01:29:50,778 --> 01:29:52,713
That helpless woman.

655
01:29:53,048 --> 01:29:57,815
Where is she?
- Sorry, I can not tell the police.

656
01:30:00,789 --> 01:30:04,816
Why did I scream?
- You are guilty of this!

657
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:08,427
Your love it breaks!
Make it clear

658
01:30:08,630 --> 01:30:14,433
not to impose
handcuffed him!

659
01:30:17,306 --> 01:30:20,434
1 billion? Are you crazy
Jackson?

660
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:24,438
To give you a gold value
5 billion to 1 billion?

661
01:30:25,314 --> 01:30:29,273
Everybody knows that gold
not yours, and the Chakradari.

662
01:30:29,651 --> 01:30:33,781
Chakradari will decapitated anyone
that touch that gold.

663
01:30:36,758 --> 01:30:40,320
People who fear death
not engaged in this business.

664
01:30:40,329 --> 01:30:44,857
Or buy gold for 2. 5 billion,
or get out!

665
01:30:47,102 --> 01:30:53,632
Billa, listen! - I will not buy
gold coin for you even!

666
01:30:53,842 --> 01:30:58,643
Mr. Jackson is not angry!
Billa will talk to and will understand.

667
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:14,150
Even the hyena does not look
to my good.

668
01:31:14,362 --> 01:31:17,160
How did this mistake?
- It's business.

669
01:31:17,365 --> 01:31:19,492
Who assumes no risk for lucrative business?

670
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:22,498
Then take the risk!

671
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:30,176
Where's Billa? Speak!

672
01:31:39,554 --> 01:31:42,853
Chief, Billa escape!

673
01:31:43,391 --> 01:31:49,523
Can preobarnesh sky
and earth, but will get him!

674
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:55,364
Billa will surely come!
You're in my hands!

675
01:31:55,736 --> 01:31:58,734
Lily, you are not his strength,
a weakness!

676
01:31:58,739 --> 01:32:06,407
He can not live without you -
Where will he go? Come on!

677
01:32:09,517 --> 01:32:13,044
Your father is a thief, smuggler
and a traitor to the nation!

678
01:32:26,601 --> 01:32:30,901
Listen! Do not they understand,
I knew that my father...

What are you doing?
- Please! - Get out of here!

689
01:33:25,826 --> 01:33:27,453
What happens there?

690
01:33:27,828 --> 01:33:30,797
It...
- Mr judge alone decide.

691
01:33:30,998 --> 01:33:35,328
Lovers sometimes make small mistakes
should not be taken seriously.

692
01:33:35,336 --> 01:33:38,965
I beg him to forgive me
and he did not even hear me!

693
01:33:39,173 --> 01:33:42,973
Is it fair?
Please explain it.

01:33:44,612 --> 01:33:50,244

You... before...
- Yes, I am the same Madu.

01:33:54,955 --> 01:34:00,325
Mr. Ajay, get out
and find out.

697
01:39:14,174 --> 01:39:16,301
Milkman!

698
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:26,647
Who are you? Where is Ramlakan?
- He went to his village.

699
01:39:26,854 --> 01:39:30,813
I am the son of his aunt.
How much milk do you want?

700
01:39:34,862 --> 01:39:40,323
Your suspicions are correct,
Seth lives in the house of nach. Arjun.

701
01:39:53,614 --> 01:39:59,348
Sir, you? What brings you here?
- Obiskirame came to your house.

702
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:06,956
For what?
- You 're hiding defendants Sita at his home.

703
01:40:07,327 --> 01:40:12,355
And if this is a lie?
- The shoes you will be on my head.

704
01:40:13,233 --> 01:40:17,363
You can searched.
- Come on, searched!

705
01:40:21,575 --> 01:40:24,043
Sir, there is no one.

706
01:40:24,912 --> 01:40:28,040
Sir, and there's no one.

707
01:40:28,916 --> 01:40:32,716
We found it! Come on!

708
01:40:38,926 --> 01:40:43,124
Raise your veil!
- Savitri, why not show your face?

709
01:40:43,363 --> 01:40:46,662
You told me not to show
the face of your husband.

710
01:40:46,934 --> 01:40:51,735
But the Commissioner to show you.
- First step back her husband.

711
01:40:52,039 --> 01:40:54,906
Come back!

712
01:41:06,954 --> 01:41:10,082
You can go.

713
01:41:13,393 --> 01:41:16,658
It is one that must
to apologize.

714
01:41:16,964 --> 01:41:23,426
He continued to spit at the sky,
but it falls on his face.

715
01:41:23,971 --> 01:41:30,604
How about now?
- Well, sir, I go.

716
01:41:31,078 --> 01:41:33,273
You must hit him with sandals.

717
01:41:34,815 --> 01:41:38,114
Really worried about you.
Now go.

718
01:41:40,087 --> 01:41:42,612
Best to stay away
the police.

719
01:41:42,823 --> 01:41:47,453
Nor friendly,
nor to quarrel with them.

720
01:41:48,395 --> 01:41:52,456
Brother?
- Do not brother and head of Arjun.

721
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:57,463
If the pigeon closes his eyes,
cat will not escape!

722
01:41:57,838 --> 01:42:01,797
Seth arrest you!
Come with me!

723
01:42:02,009 --> 01:42:04,978
Brother, the old anger again?
Relax.

724
01:42:05,345 --> 01:42:08,803
Will you arrest and jail.
What do you get? Medal?

725
01:42:09,016 --> 01:42:13,646
I'll give you one, forget about it.
- I can forget about you

726
01:42:14,354 --> 01:42:19,656
but not my debt!
- I will not forget her sister.

727
01:42:20,027 --> 01:42:24,157
Let anyone dare touch it.
- Want to see?

728
01:42:24,765 --> 01:42:28,496
Get out of my way!

729
01:42:28,702 --> 01:42:32,502
What are you doing?
- Lakshmi, let me!

730
01:42:32,706 --> 01:42:36,506
Ajay, take it and run!

731
01:42:52,492 --> 01:42:59,830
Unfortunate I caused a rift
between two brothers.

732
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:05,838
Brother, giving me the police
and return home.

733
01:43:06,573 --> 01:43:10,839
Can a brother to forward
sister to the police?

734
01:43:11,411 --> 01:43:15,848
Do not worry about me.
First to invent

735
01:43:16,416 --> 01:43:18,884
how can make Billa
from his lair.

736
01:43:19,253 --> 01:43:24,247
If we find Sudir, he
will understand where lies Billa.

737
01:43:25,592 --> 01:43:29,892
Unable to get to Sudir,
He is in custody of your brother.

738
01:43:30,097 --> 01:43:33,897
Not seen what I can.

739
01:43:42,442 --> 01:43:45,741
Where are you Munnu?

740
01:43:45,946 --> 01:43:50,246
This is not Islamic school
a police station.

741
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:54,580
Did I say it is a brothel
of Munnu?

742
01:43:54,955 --> 01:43:58,891
No respect for older
because of his uniform!

743
01:43:59,459 --> 01:44:02,656
I am old as your grandfather.
Worship me

744
01:44:02,863 --> 01:44:06,924
or I'll tell you to take Munnu
pants! - Who Munnu?

745
01:44:07,134 --> 01:44:11,935
Damn fool!
- So your boss is our Munnu?

746
01:44:12,139 --> 01:44:16,940
Once you've played in my lap, is not it
my Munnu? Damn fool!

747
01:44:18,645 --> 01:44:23,605
Go and tell Munnu,
that his uncle Khan banned here.

748
01:44:24,251 --> 01:44:28,620
G-nut went to court and do not know
when he will return.

749
01:44:29,323 --> 01:44:39,858
How will you carry this load
traipse all the way to Bombay?

750
01:44:40,267 --> 01:44:43,964
What's in it?
- Everything!

751
01:44:44,171 --> 01:44:49,803
Everything I gave to Munnu
in childhood, is here.

752
01:44:50,844 --> 01:44:58,808
Sweet from Delhi, Mathur,
Calcutta, Agra and Laknau.

753
01:44:59,186 --> 01:45:03,316
But Munnu is not free even
for my birthday.

754
01:45:03,523 --> 01:45:09,655
We like him celebrate
us his birthday.

755
01:45:09,863 --> 01:45:17,998
Here... these! No one, everyone!
You also get your!

756
01:45:18,205 --> 01:45:22,335
Why be ashamed? Please!
- Thanks.

757
01:45:22,542 --> 01:45:25,602
Why are you there?
Come here!

758
01:45:25,879 --> 01:45:31,681
Are made of pure ghee and eat!
- I have diabetes, you will die!

759
01:45:32,052 --> 01:45:36,751
Even if you do not eat, you die.
- How?

760
01:45:36,957 --> 01:45:44,363
If Munnu understand that you have not
obeyed, they will send up.

761
01:45:44,564 --> 01:45:47,533
Then give me.

762
01:45:47,734 --> 01:45:50,532
Get... eat!

763
01:45:50,904 --> 01:45:55,864
Take and eat everything!

764
01:45:56,243 --> 01:45:58,871
Eat!
- I eat!

765
01:45:59,246 --> 01:46:02,477
All eat!

766
01:46:06,019 --> 01:46:11,719
Sir... You?

767
01:46:22,936 --> 01:46:27,032
So Mr. Chakradari they send
save me? - No.

768
01:46:27,607 --> 01:46:30,735
I will pray for the living death.

769
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:35,974
You're the brother of a policeman Arjun!

770
01:46:36,283 --> 01:46:38,710
I am the brother of every Indian

771
01:46:38,718 --> 01:46:41,744
but the butcher for traitors like you!
Go!

772
01:46:57,137 --> 01:46:59,106
What happened to you?

773
01:47:00,307 --> 01:47:03,834
Where is Sudir? - Your brother
come dressed as a man.

774
01:47:04,044 --> 01:47:06,504
We sleep and took Sudir.

775
01:47:10,317 --> 01:47:16,779
Speak!
- Hit the scam yet!

776
01:47:18,992 --> 01:47:25,022
Who is this guy? How do you say?
- I know nothing!

777
01:47:25,432 --> 01:47:31,701
Speak! Otherwise lawyer
Your case will end here!

778
01:47:32,072 --> 01:47:34,632
This Artemis
I will announce the sentence,

779
01:47:35,008 --> 01:47:44,144
I'll put the noose
of your neck! Speak!

780
01:47:44,417 --> 01:47:47,750
I know nothing...
- Wait, Grandma!

781
01:47:48,021 --> 01:47:55,052
He wants to kill my husband, so
I only have the right to kill him!

782
01:47:55,362 --> 01:47:57,887
Say, you bastard! Who is the fucker,

783
01:47:58,098 --> 01:48:02,000
the reason for crime
My husband has been punished?

784
01:48:02,202 --> 01:48:10,166
Speak or I'll kill you!
- I know nothing!

785
01:48:14,814 --> 01:48:17,681
Uncle, I am Sudir.

786
01:48:18,051 --> 01:48:21,020
Fled from police.
- What?

787
01:48:21,388 --> 01:48:23,754
Where are you calling now?
- Then I will explain.

788
01:48:24,124 --> 01:48:29,528
Seth is in my hands.
- Now bring the bitch here!

789
01:48:29,729 --> 01:48:34,029
Unable to say - Why?
- The police are after me like dogs.

790
01:48:35,068 --> 01:48:37,866
Then where to see?
- Come into the garden with mango,

791
01:48:38,071 --> 01:48:41,199
behind the temple of Goddess Kali,
keep it there.

792
01:48:41,408 --> 01:48:42,876
Coming soon!

793
01:48:56,089 --> 01:48:57,057
Here it is!

794
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:14,908
Get her!

795
01:51:25,239 --> 01:51:29,208
You?
- Yes, I! Where is the double of Ram?

796
01:51:29,409 --> 01:51:35,370
Do not hit me!
- Talk or I'll kill you! Speak!

797
01:51:47,261 --> 01:51:52,061
Bravo, Billa! On time
and saved my life.

798
01:51:52,432 --> 01:51:56,391
I will never forget it.
- Remember one!

799
01:51:56,669 --> 01:52:00,366
If we continue to struggle
Gold in two monkeys

800
01:52:00,673 --> 01:52:03,733
Some cats will benefit
this.

801
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:07,912
If we stand together, no one
We dare to rise.

802
01:52:08,281 --> 01:52:13,241
Did you see the result of splitting us?
- Right.

803
01:52:13,453 --> 01:52:19,255
First to take you bastard in den
and to find out where Sita was.

804
01:52:19,626 --> 01:52:24,427
While she was alive, death
will hang over our heads.

805
01:52:29,035 --> 01:52:33,028
Madu's calling the life of Ajay
is in danger! - What?

806
01:52:33,306 --> 01:52:36,434
Come now!

807
01:52:45,486 --> 01:52:47,852
Tell me where you got Seth!

808
01:52:48,055 --> 01:52:53,357
Speak or I'll throw down and
even your bones will not find!

809
01:52:55,396 --> 01:52:57,364
Fight bastard!

810
01:53:01,001 --> 01:53:03,459
Chief, Police!

811
01:53:05,673 --> 01:53:07,301
Run!
- Come on!

812
01:54:04,231 --> 01:54:06,199
Are you okay?

813
01:54:09,403 --> 01:54:12,531
Billa Ram looks like.
It is Chakradari.

814
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:15,709
Now I'll get him.
- No! That's our job!

815
01:54:16,076 --> 01:54:20,035
Do very cute!
- But... - I told you!

816
01:54:21,247 --> 01:54:25,876
Sir, all ran away!
- Arrest him!

817
01:54:30,858 --> 01:54:34,225
So this is the house of Justice
and there - her guardian!

818
01:54:34,428 --> 01:54:41,095
Allow criminals to escape,
but concluded an innocent!

819
01:54:41,769 --> 01:54:47,571
You call yourself innocent?
Sita hid from the law

820
01:54:47,775 --> 01:54:50,903
Sudir and free. Is not it
crime? - Okay.

821
01:54:51,111 --> 01:54:54,838
If I think of a villain
Punish me as you want.

822
01:54:54,882 --> 01:54:57,607
But why innocent Ram
should be punished?

823
01:54:57,618 --> 01:55:02,378
The man stole gold
Ram is not a Double his Billa.

824
01:55:02,456 --> 01:55:07,525
Chakradari benefit from the appearance
of Billa, to dip Ram.

825
01:55:07,528 --> 01:55:11,157
Considering it a criminal
Law decided to be hanged.

826
01:55:11,532 --> 01:55:15,195
If you hang Ram will be
responsible for his murder

827
01:55:15,469 --> 01:55:19,269
and God will never forgive you.

828
01:55:19,907 --> 01:55:24,344
If one innocent man die
your life will be cursed!

829
01:55:24,545 --> 01:55:29,448
Neither will live or die
Relax!

830
01:55:32,152 --> 01:55:35,952
If you can not do anything
just give me 24 hours.

831
01:55:36,156 --> 01:55:39,284
We will prove the truth in court
I will save the Ram from gallows

832
01:55:39,493 --> 01:55:43,953
and will get back to you.
Then you can punish me.

833
01:55:44,832 --> 01:55:49,963
Are you completely confident
Ram that is innocent?

834
01:55:50,838 --> 01:55:55,036
That really double?
- I swear to you, brother.

835
01:55:55,275 --> 01:55:59,974
Ram is innocent.

836
01:56:01,281 --> 01:56:07,653
Do not worry. If Ram is innocent
I will not let it hang.

837
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:23,566
Wait here, I will come.
- Okay.

838
01:56:25,872 --> 01:56:30,002
Good day!
- What brings you here?

839
01:56:32,879 --> 01:56:36,178
Kakko, you? Here?
- Oh my God!

840
01:56:36,883 --> 01:56:41,320
How dare you arrest him?
Who do you think?

841
01:56:41,554 --> 01:56:44,352
Will discard all of you!
I will judge you all!

842
01:56:44,557 --> 01:56:47,185
Will be split with their uniforms!
- Please listen to me!

843
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:53,692
What? Appendage! - I'm knot, a policeman No 220.
- You look like 420.

844
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,698
I can lock Devereaux
not fun!

845
01:56:56,903 --> 01:56:59,201
As it released!

846
01:56:59,572 --> 01:57:03,702
Come on!
- But we arrested him the boss.

847
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:07,038
I can handle it at home
you release him!

848
01:57:07,246 --> 01:57:10,613
We can not run without
guarantee of 2000 rupees.

849
01:57:10,917 --> 01:57:16,378
Are not you ashamed to want
bribery of a woman police officer?

850
01:57:16,589 --> 01:57:20,548
I will sue you!
- It's not bribery, it is the law.

851
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:24,218
Go to hell with your law!
Want money? Get it!

852
01:57:24,430 --> 01:57:27,058
We can not get jewelry.
- Then release him!

853
01:57:27,266 --> 01:57:29,564
If you free, no boss
leave us alone!

854
01:57:29,769 --> 01:57:32,067
If you do not release you
will not leave us! Come!

855
01:57:32,338 --> 01:57:37,401
Sign documents and take it.
Dilip Singh, release him!

856
01:57:38,945 --> 01:57:42,403
Here, fill in the rest alone.

857
01:57:42,782 --> 01:57:44,750
Why do such things?

858
01:57:44,951 --> 01:57:48,751
Do not you know how much strain?
Come on!

859
01:58:07,306 --> 01:58:13,108
You come to me to outsource
burial stretcher you?

860
01:58:13,813 --> 01:58:16,748
I know that the law did
a mistake.

861
01:58:17,083 --> 01:58:21,110
But when you come to know
what is the error.

862
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:30,695
I begged you to give me time
but you do not believe me.

863
01:58:30,997 --> 01:58:34,524
Because of the prestige of the law
I cast into prison.

864
01:58:34,767 --> 01:58:37,463
Now, using this law,
I'll save you.

865
01:58:37,737 --> 01:58:42,470
Trust me and tell me
What happened to you.

866
01:58:43,109 --> 01:58:51,141
Tell me Ram.
- I will tell you everything.

867
01:58:52,118 --> 01:58:59,991
I had a happy family -
me and my wife, who was waiting child.

868
01:59:10,036 --> 01:59:13,733
Now no power in the world
they will send to the gallows!

869
01:59:16,042 --> 01:59:19,341
The date for the hanging of Ram
defined.

870
01:59:19,712 --> 01:59:23,808
His appeal for clemency
is rejected.

871
01:59:24,383 --> 01:59:31,186
He will be hanged on 21st
at 5:45 in the morning.

872
01:59:34,393 --> 01:59:36,827
What happened?

873
01:59:37,396 --> 01:59:40,832
You can collect it

874
01:59:41,734 --> 01:59:47,195
but after 2 days without you
To avoid widowhood.

875
01:59:47,573 --> 01:59:53,478
So the date is set?
- Yes.

876
01:59:53,746 --> 01:59:59,548
No!

877
02:00:12,265 --> 02:00:19,899
The government ordered me
it hanged on the 21st.

878
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:31,874
But even hang me
I will not do this sin!

879
02:00:32,785 --> 02:00:37,245
No, Grandma! Neither you nor I
should be hanged!

880
02:00:37,556 --> 02:00:41,583
Those who deceived Justice
should be hanged!

881
02:00:42,128 --> 02:00:45,825
I swear this sindur,

882
02:00:46,132 --> 02:00:51,092
before that to hang my husband
I shall deal with those

883
02:00:51,470 --> 02:00:55,270
who are the real killers!

884
02:00:56,142 --> 02:00:59,270
21st!

885
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:05,317
We started with it!
Bring it up, Granny!

886
02:01:09,822 --> 02:01:12,620
Come on!

887
02:01:12,825 --> 02:01:17,285
Let me go!

888
02:01:17,997 --> 02:01:24,960
Will not leave!
- Go and pull the rope!

889
02:01:26,605 --> 02:01:30,132
Scream loud!

890
02:01:30,509 --> 02:01:34,309
Scream so loud
until izdahnesh!

891
02:01:34,847 --> 02:01:41,582
Let your cries go
to the cell of my husband!

892
02:01:41,854 --> 02:01:46,314
Will receive at least a small consolation!
- Stop!

893
02:01:46,625 --> 02:01:50,891
Do not stain his hands dirty
blood! Untie it!

894
02:01:51,197 --> 02:01:53,665
I learned the truth
come to help you.

895
02:01:53,866 --> 02:01:57,063
My world will collapse after 2 days
how will you help?

896
02:01:57,303 --> 02:02:03,173
Two days are sufficient. Story
may change even in one day.

897
02:02:03,542 --> 02:02:07,273
Do not worry, it will lead us
the real criminal.

898
02:02:08,047 --> 02:02:13,349
Go there! Will bring you
to God of Death!

899
02:02:16,555 --> 02:02:20,082
Get up! God of Death...

900
02:02:20,326 --> 02:02:24,990
How come? - Under warranty!
- Who you give it? - Kaka!

901
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:32,695
You? - Yes. Do not argue now
must catch and Billa.

902
02:02:38,244 --> 02:02:41,042
What happened to Billa?
- They accepted our conditions.

903
02:02:44,250 --> 02:02:48,710
Tomorrow submit 5000000000
a Swiss bank on my behalf.

904
02:02:49,088 --> 02:02:57,052
A Chakradari will bring you
gold the day after.

905
02:02:58,931 --> 02:03:03,061
Then let's drink
for this happy event!

906
02:08:32,331 --> 02:08:35,232
How great dance
my nightingale!

907
02:08:35,434 --> 02:08:40,394
You stole my heart!
- Really?

908
02:08:45,444 --> 02:08:47,412
You?

909
02:08:56,955 --> 02:08:59,480
Ram, your life already
is not in danger.

910
02:08:59,725 --> 02:09:03,422
Hurry up and change clothes
the real killer.

911
02:09:07,733 --> 02:09:11,328
Tamnicharyu will never forget
great service that we do.

912
02:09:11,637 --> 02:09:14,435
I did no
service, Mr Arjun.

913
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:18,098
I did what a soldier
the law should do.

914
02:09:20,646 --> 02:09:26,050
Look everywhere! Billa want at any price!
- We can not find it!

915
02:09:26,318 --> 02:09:29,776
Do not evaporated in the air?

916
02:09:36,094 --> 02:09:39,120
Billa, you? Where were you?

917
02:09:39,331 --> 02:09:43,461
I thought my bank reserve
has left me! Come hug!

918
02:09:46,672 --> 02:09:51,371
I'm not Billa and Ram!
- Ram? - Yes!

919
02:09:51,677 --> 02:09:54,976
Billa is in jail instead of Ram.

920
02:09:55,347 --> 02:09:57,975
And I will be hanged tomorrow morning.

921
02:09:59,685 --> 02:10:02,654
We played in your own
game against you!

922
02:10:03,021 --> 02:10:06,320
I could have you arrested before,

923
02:10:06,692 --> 02:10:10,458
but had to save
Ram innocent.

924
02:10:11,029 --> 02:10:13,463
Now wait for me every day

925
02:10:13,799 --> 02:10:19,396
to see when will they arrest.
- You will arrest me?

926
02:10:19,705 --> 02:10:23,232
Not just Mumbai, but Delhi
play my whistle!

927
02:10:23,442 --> 02:10:28,175
If you do not become uniform
in your burial shroud,

928
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:32,077
my name is not Chakradari!
- My father in law unfair!

929
02:10:32,451 --> 02:10:36,012
Using its appearance,
Ram send you to prison.

930
02:10:36,388 --> 02:10:39,516
We used the same tactics
Billa and sent to prison.

931
02:10:39,825 --> 02:10:41,918
Engagement between law
and justice done.

932
02:10:42,127 --> 02:10:44,687
Now begins the engagement between
man and the devil.

933
02:10:44,897 --> 02:10:51,860
This battle will continue
black by the end of your share!

934
02:10:53,071 --> 02:10:55,201
Let's go!

935
02:10:56,743 --> 02:11:01,806
A player who believes a move
the end is stupid!

936
02:11:02,081 --> 02:11:07,815
Billa, these three will not allow you
to live, but I will give you to die.

937
02:11:20,433 --> 02:11:23,561
What is this? Where am I?

938
02:11:26,438 --> 02:11:30,899
Whose are these clothes? 117?
These are the clothes of a prisoner!

939
02:11:32,111 --> 02:11:36,514
Oh, God! This is a prison!
How did I get here? I'm locked.

940
02:11:36,783 --> 02:11:40,981
Hey, bro!

941
02:11:41,187 --> 02:11:45,851
Come here me out!

942
02:11:46,225 --> 02:11:50,992
Get me outta here!
Someone is locked!

943
02:11:51,197 --> 02:11:54,166
Why do you cry every day?

944
02:11:54,534 --> 02:11:58,937
I'm not this guy!
I am not a Ram, and Billa!

945
02:11:59,138 --> 02:12:02,266
I do not know what led me here!
- No kidding.

946
02:12:02,475 --> 02:12:05,603
Do not eat prison food
with us last night?

947
02:12:05,812 --> 02:12:08,906
I have to eat prison food?
Are you crazy?

948
02:12:09,148 --> 02:12:13,279
Last night I was at a party and ate chicken.
- In your dreams?

949
02:12:14,821 --> 02:12:16,618
Coming jailer!

950
02:12:16,823 --> 02:12:23,786
Tamnicharyu, please save me!
I am innocent!

951
02:12:23,997 --> 02:12:28,297
It's a trap!

952
02:12:29,335 --> 02:12:35,205
Let me go! I am not Ram,
Billa and his twin!

953
02:12:35,508 --> 02:12:39,467
Saying that from the moment
which fell here.

954
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:45,982
This is the trap of head Arjun
and his brother Ajay! I am innocent!

955
02:12:46,185 --> 02:12:50,645
Prepare to go up!
- Up? Where?

956
02:12:50,857 --> 02:12:53,985
Start to do its work.

957
02:12:55,528 --> 02:12:58,326
I'm fine, man!

958
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:04,328
Tamnicharyu stop them!

959
02:13:08,541 --> 02:13:11,339
I'm going insane!

960
02:13:21,554 --> 02:13:26,685
Tamnicharyu, hear me!
I am innocent!

961
02:13:31,064 --> 02:13:40,371
No! I am not a Ram!
Where are you wearing? Let me go!

962
02:13:42,575 --> 02:13:45,544
Long wait for you!

963
02:13:45,912 --> 02:13:49,370
You are the people
who killed my son!

964
02:13:49,649 --> 02:13:56,384
Today will be happy to send you
Death to you!

965
02:13:56,756 --> 02:14:00,715
No!

966
02:14:30,456 --> 02:14:35,917
You saved me from death
today my life is yours!

967
02:14:36,295 --> 02:14:40,664
I just want gold. Tell where he
- I say.

968
02:14:40,967 --> 02:14:44,767
Driver, go to tigarskiya waterfall.

969
02:15:04,657 --> 02:15:05,625
Left.

970
02:15:52,471 --> 02:15:57,738
Gold found! - Where?
- In tigarskiya Falls...

971
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:03,515
You?

972
02:16:03,716 --> 02:16:07,812
Look Chakradari! Daughter
organize your death!

973
02:16:08,154 --> 02:16:11,851
Cheaters! Daughters pray
for long life of their fathers,

974
02:16:12,058 --> 02:16:14,994
and you want me expelled
of this world!

975
02:16:15,061 --> 02:16:17,957
Tell me who talked with
or I'll kill you!

976
02:16:18,064 --> 02:16:20,789
You can not kill me,
I am your daughter!

977
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:24,201
But I can kill you
I am not your father!

978
02:16:26,072 --> 02:16:29,838
It seems to me that Madu is in danger.
- Do hurry!

979
02:17:12,451 --> 02:17:15,887
Ajay, from that country
you - the other, hurry!

980
02:17:26,132 --> 02:17:28,100
Leave him.

981
02:24:01,361 --> 02:24:03,329
He is dead!

982
02:25:48,968 --> 02:25:51,402
What are you doing?

983
02:25:51,704 --> 02:25:57,267
To prove our innocence,
you two are risking their lives.

984
02:25:57,644 --> 02:26:03,105
I do not know how to thank you
aid.

985
02:26:03,650 --> 02:26:09,782
It was our duty as human beings.

986
02:26:10,490 --> 02:26:15,359
I lost all hope,
that will again see her husband.

987
02:26:15,728 --> 02:26:19,789
But you come back to me.

988
02:26:20,166 --> 02:26:22,135
Do not say that, sister.

989
02:26:25,672 --> 02:26:29,132
Please, today it is your son.

990
02:26:31,511 --> 02:26:33,378
Please, sister.

991
02:26:38,017 --> 02:26:41,475
From today there is not one
and two mothers.
