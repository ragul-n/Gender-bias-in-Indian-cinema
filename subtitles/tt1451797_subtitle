43 dead... 55
injured... 19 critical...

42
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,135
Bomb blast has become so
common a thing in the country...

43
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,234
That instead of it
being a breaking news...

44
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:36,935
It No longer qualifies to
be called even a mere news...

45
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,601
Once again the anger
of Hindus in...

46
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,967
...our Nation reach
its boiling point...

47
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,302
Everyone is pointing finger at the
muslims staying in the country...

48
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:49,267
Once again it is being said...

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,835
...that if ever there can be any
relation between hindus 8 muslim...

50
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,202
...then it can be
only of Hatred...

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,601
I would like to
ask a question...

52
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,734
...to all of you...
and to myself too...

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,535
Samir khan being
a film superstar

54
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,834
Rules over the
hearts of millions...

55
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,035
In his films he is so
often praised by Hindus...

56
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,134
To his millions of fans
I would like to ask...

57
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,269
Are you not aware as to which
religion Samir Khan belongs to?

58
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,801
If we are to believe in
this ongoing thought...

59
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,535
That despise and
disagreement can be...

60
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,535
...the only bond between
the two communities...

61
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,534
Then by the same
rationale Samir Khan...

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,635
...should have become this
countries biggest enemy...

63
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:40,603
There are many people who are
popular amongst the Hindus...

64
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,102
And there are many names
whom the Muslims respect too...

65
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:48,069
The Fanatic Thinking of a
select few opportunists is...

66
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,000
fl Communal Hatred'

67
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:53,902
This is something we all are
aware of... and understand it too...

68
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,068
Then why do we let this
become our line of thought?

69
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,166
Why?

70
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,067
Just think about it...

71
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,701
Wish you would love me
as much as you love...

72
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,601
...Viiay Harshvardhan Mallik...

73
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,467
God you are obsessed
with the man...

74
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,934
Not Obsessed... I
just respect him...

75
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:15,600
And you must too...

76
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,634
Hello, I am very
busy in my life...

77
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,835
I don't have time
to respect anyone...

78
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:20,800
I know...

79
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,667
More then country's
problems you are...

80
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,167
more interested
in movie gossips...

81
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,002
So? What's wrong? Gossip
is atleast entertaining...

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,801
Ok. Lets not start this again...

83
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,200
I still cannot believe...

84
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,467
I am ioining Viiay sir's
channel from tomorrow...

85
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,235

Have a good day...

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,702
Today we have an Ad shoot
for holay holay hair remover...

89
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:47,101
...am going to be late
tonight so make some food...

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,102
and please... Not your favourite
vegetable dish Bitter Gourd...

91
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,701
Bye... Bye...

92
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:54,768
9 months ago the most
brutal terrorist...

93
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,867
...attack ever
happened in country...

94
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,935
responsible
ministers assured to...

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,801
...tighten country's
security system...

96
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,801
...and today again
a bomb blast...

97
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,167
Even after so many attacks...

98
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:11,402
has our system not learnt
anything from its mistakes?

99
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,634
Or is it that our
mistakes have transformed...

100
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,401
into becoming a habit
or helplessness...

101
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,801
If it is so...

102
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,401
then this very status
of ours is much more...

103
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,000
...dangerous then terrorism.

104
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,601
Your dad is iust terrific...

105
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,467
Much dangerous...

106
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,133
Ya he is...

107
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,701
Just think about it...

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,167
But the channel is not...

109
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:35,700
What?

110
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:41,504
Dad feels, media's solemn
duty is to serve the public...

111
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,869
So... isn't he right?

112
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,801
But if the doctor
himself falls ill...

113
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,067
...how will he
treat the diseased?

114
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,901
What do you mean?

115
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,801
Our channel is turning
into a sick unit Yas...

116
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,768
Lime and cola doesn't wish
to renew their deal with us...

117
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:08,335
our TRPs have fallen
to an all time low...

118
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,836
That new show we were
launching... Common Man...

119
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,567
what's happening on it?

120
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,669
Headlines 24 has iust
yesterday launched a show...

121
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,902
The show is called...
. # Ordinary Man'...

122
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:26,468
Sir you are aware that in
today's times ideas are few...

123
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:27,600
and competition high...

124
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,834
...and every persons
a walking spy camera...

125
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,468
Its very difficult
to keep a secret...

126
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:34,002
and its possible they too might
have thought this very same idea

127
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,468
I don't know these
things are hard to tell...

128
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,367
I would like you to
take a look at this Sir...

129
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,001
Yas in today's times business...

130
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,067
...doesn't run on principals...

131
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,335
But iai... media is
not just a business...

132
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,900
You are missing the point...

133
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,068
Just as soap garments
etc are a business...

134
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,734
News channel is a business too...

135
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:01,634
It needs money investment...

136
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,634
And wherever money is invested...

137
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,601
...there can be
only one objective...

138
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,000
To Make Money...

139
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:09,835
But iai... everyone
regards you father highly...

140
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,833
then where's the problem?

141
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,567
Not everyone...

142
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,601
Only educated people like you...

143
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:22,402
That makes no difference to
my channel business though...

144
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,301
And this top ranking channel...

145
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:26,367
Headlines 24...

146
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,435
The person who runs it is
neither terrific like my Dad...

147
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,934
Nor does anyone respect him...

148
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,401
Despite of that isn't
he high above? Ruling...

149
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,868
on top. Bastard...

150
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,267
Who?

151
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,701
A few years ago he was a
mere employee with us...

152
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,000
Amrish Khakkar...

153
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,834
Now I realize, the kind
of donkeys I've been...

154
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,268
breeding in my channel...

155
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,401
Instead of Headlines 24...

156
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,000
You all should be
in India 24 x 7...

157
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,667
with Viiay
Harshvarddhan Mallik...

158
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,403
How many times I've said,
convert News into spice and Sell...

159
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:05,733
And listen...

160
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,900
Get rid of these
plain looking women

161
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:09,335
...instead bring in beautiful
models... take them to a beach...

162
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,634
put them in skimpy clothes...

163
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,568
...and them let them speak
about the weather analysis...

164
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:15,035
who wish to hear will listen...
who wish to see will watch...

165
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,535
Remember, presentation
is everything...

166
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,300
Presentation is not everything...

167
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,568
Media's purpose is to
evaluate the truth regarding...

168
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,267
the information and
present it to the public.

169
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,568
Maybe because of
our principals...

170
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,735
...we are lagging behind as
compared to other channels but...

171
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,667
...This is not a race...

172
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,334
If we have to review ourselves...

173
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,969
we should question
ourselves as to how honest...

174
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,034
how talented... how
un-biased we are.

175
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,901
The answer to these questions
is what India 24l7 stands on...

176
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,767
...and will remain standing...

177
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:45,467
Hi Dad...

178
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,268
The necessity that Prime
minister Hooda was...

179
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,635
feeling since many months
has today been fulfilled...

180
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,033
What necessity Dad?

181
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,634
Since a long time Hooda has
been saying that our country...

182
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,634
...to fight against terrorism...

183
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,937
...needs a much more forceful
law then the existing one.

184
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,301
But the opposition leader Mohan
Pandey doesn't agree with him...

185
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,736
However after today's bomb blast
the opinion polls are saying...

186
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,201
...that the people of
the country support Hooda.

187
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:21,367
What do you feel Dad?

188
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,500
I have faith in Hooda...

189
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:26,869
After many years the country
has got a leader like him...

190
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:27,933
i like him

191
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:29,966
yUp...

192
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,867
i'll get back to you...

193
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,201
yes... I said I'll
get back to you...

194
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,535
Your Brother in
law wishes that...

195
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,268
...lndia 24l7 should...

196
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,668
...praise his company

197
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,734
I'll speak to him dad...

198
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,667
Today morning Prime
Minister Dig Vijay Hooda

199
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,167
visited Muzaffarnagar...

200
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,735
...and inspected the site
where the bomb blast took place.

201
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,201
Its a great misfortune
that has fallen on the...

202
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,767
innocent victims of this blast...

203
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:11,504
...and their family members...

204
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,401
...but it is a much
greater misfortune of mine...

205
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,835
...that despite knowing the
solution to the problem...

206
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,634
I can do nothing.

207
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,801
What greater misfortune
could there be?

208
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:31,335
To fight against terrorism
this country needs...

209
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:36,136
...a tough anti terror act.

210
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:38,167
If we don't understand this now...

211
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,701
...then we never will.

212
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:44,135
I don't know how many
more times will we keep...

213
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,301
punishing the countrymen...

214
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,434
...for our stupidity, in
the form of these attacks

215
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,503
Under the circumstances
along with the prime minister,

216
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,501
the entire nation feels the
need for tough measures...

217
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,135
Despite of this the
opposition party leader...

218
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,301
Mr. Mohan Pandey is
vehemently opposing the bill.

219
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,403
Its a Sham... This bill
is an outright Sham.

220
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,835
Taking advantage
of the bomb blast...

221
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:11,637
Its a novel ploy of Hooda to
seize complete authority of power...

222
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:15,402
Mr. Hooda is already
busy preparing...

223
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,501
...plans to get the bill
passed as soon as possible...

224
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:21,235
...so that his
government can at once...

225
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,402
begin abusing law and order...

226
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,767
The truth is...

227
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,836
...that Mr. Hooda is trying
to take unfair advantage...

228
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,235
of the situation of
fear in the country...

229
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:36,468
...this country does
not need a new law...

230
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:40,236
It requires tougher measures...

231
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:44,636
Mr. Hoodas scheme
to become Hitler...

232
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,069
...shall face our full
protest with all our might...

233
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,469
And the award for the
best actor goes to...

234
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,334
Mr. Mohan Pandey... Cheers.

235
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,102
But after the bomb blast
the Public sentiment...

236
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:57,135
...seems to be leaning
in favor of Hooda

237
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:58,667
Prime Minister Hooda...

238
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,335
will definitely confront
this problem and succeed

239
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,135
he has got the people
of the country's...

240
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,267
unshakable faith and support

241
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,602
These Media whores
now a days are...

242
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:10,301
rather noisily
beating Hoodas drum.

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,102
What do you feel?
What will happen?

244
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,337
Hmmmm... Naveen, ask
what all won't happen.

245
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:23,035
If Hoodas charm
continues at this rate...

246
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:26,268
...I will never be able to
become the prime minister...

247
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,301
...and you...

248
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:32,469
...will never be able to
remove your cousin brother...

249
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,102
to become the number
one Industrialist.

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,201
What do we do?

251
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,167
We will have to do something...

252
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,501
Hmmmm...

253
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:48,002
We will have to do something...

254
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,433
But what?

255
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,667
I feel what Mohan Pandey
says is absolutely right...

256
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,600
Hooda is iust
fooling the country...

257
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,601
Please Nandita... What
do you know about Pandey?

258
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,367
...Or for that
matter about Hooda?

259
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,300
I don't believe...

260
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,234
People iust mindlessly form
opinions without thinking as to...

261
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,367
who is what...

262
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,368
...pandey is a bastard...

263
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,101
come on purab... be fair...

264
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,634
i mean the guy is
a popular leader.

265
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,268
Tch... cant you understand?
What is a leader?

266
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,534
Like you and me, he is iust
another working employee...

267
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,934
not obliging anyone...

268
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,100
...and Nandita, the thing is...

269
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,500
a country functions
according to a system...

270
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,567
. and you and me are
just parts of it...

271
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,267

272
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,068

00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,068

...This will give you company
in office... and your lunch...

276
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,233
bye... - Have a good day...

277
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:45,469
every street is
loudly proclaiming...

278
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:49,969
all the leaders are robbers.

279
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,702
Now every street is
loudly proclaiming...

280
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,167
All leaders are robbers...

281
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,936
They do not value Allah or Ram

282
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:01,568
They do not Value Allah or Ram...

283
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,968
and the people are
getting ripped off...

284
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,267
india...

285
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,167
India...

286
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,434
India...

287
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,934
India...

288
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,501
Jay, in the era of computers
typewriters are defunct...

289
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,435
Your dad wishes to run
the channel like a temple...

290
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,468
but he doesn't understand
that today people...

291
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,935
expect entertainment even
from the God in temple.

292
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Excuse me Mam. - Yes??

00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,434

If this continues then
India 24l7 will soon...

346
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,034
...have to bottle up...

347
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,135
My PR agency without

348
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,168
called up your
programming department...

349
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:54,502
...they took it for granted
that India 24l7 belongs to me...

350
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:57,967
I mean it...

351
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,134
...listen I know your dad...

352
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,667
Why would I do it?

353
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,834
How's everything else?

354
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,167
Everything else is good.

355
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,867
You know iay...

356
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,401
its not exactly easy to
live with your sister.

357
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,067
To stay with your
brother in law is...

358
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,268
Anyways... our soap
opera will go on and on...

359
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
you tell me...

360
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,333
How's Yasmin?

361
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:21,900
Yasmin?

362
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,834
Her name is Yasmin isn't it?

363
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,434
And don't try to lie to me.

364
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,334
I have heard about
the two of you...

365
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:32,034
...and don't ask me from
whom... I have my sources...

366
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:34,000
By the way...

367
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,168
I hope you are not
serious about her...

368
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:38,833
Why?

369
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:40,867
She's a muslim... right?

370
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:43,400
And you know mom...

371
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,302
Priya... I love Yas...

372
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,669
And sooner or later I will
have to tell Mom, isn't it?

373
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,335
You wont believe... what
a joker that Trivedi is...

374
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,201
I am surprised, a
journalist like him is

375
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,800
working for India 24l7...

376
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:03,900
oh! Purab...

377
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:06,001
there are all sorts of people
working in every company...

378
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:08,301
iust chill... - I feel Viiay sir
isn't aware about it at all...

379
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,335
Trivedi moves about with such lame
creativity in that brain of his

380
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,333
Talking of your Viiay sir...

381
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,936
...how was it with the third
angle of our love triangle?

382
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,867
Great...

383
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:20,434
ya... what did I expect...

384
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,233
and the rest of colleagues?

385
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,368
Nalini Kashyap... she's the CEO...

386
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,333
...aha...

387
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:28,133
A very nice lady... uh huh...

388
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:31,402
And Viiay Sir's Son too
was there... Jay Mallik...

389
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,767
How is he?

390
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,367
Lets eat...

391
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,867
What happened? - Not for me...

392
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,134
I've turned vegetarian ma...

393
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,702
What? Suddenly? Why dear?

394
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,834
...iust like that...
what do you mean?

395
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,901
Iust like that or
on someone's asking?

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,302
I don't listen to anyone... you
know that... so just chill...

397
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:54,668
The one who does not
listen to anyone...

398
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,434
always listens to his
girlfriend... right?

399
00:20:57,766 --> 00:20:58,700
Girlfriend?

400
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,768
Not you too... she's
just kidding ma...

401
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,367
yes... am having
dinner... tell me...

402
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,168
ok... I'll watch it... Thank you...

403
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,101
...iay do me a
favor please... - ya?

404
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,834
Can you put on
headlines 24 please?

405
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,067
Please...

406
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,334
yeah...

407
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,700
Thank you...

408
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,934
in today's age,
where starting from...

409
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,634
an ordinary man
to a millionaire...

410
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,635
and billionaires too are soundly
sleeping in their bedrooms...

411
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:38,936
We have come across a true angel
of charity in flesh and blood...

412
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,636
...in uttarakhand affected with
the Natural disaster of floods...

413
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,368
...a messiah has come
forth amongst them...

414
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:48,002
...the CEO of Shankalya Group
of Companies, Naveen Shankalya...

415
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:48,900
papa...

416
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:50,600
yes that's papa...

417
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:53,901
I didn't know you had...

418
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:56,600
...friends in Headlines 24...

419
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,668
come on iai... these
are just my PR guys...

420
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,300
They're doing their iob...

421
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,834
...you know how it is...

422
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,834
Thank you...

423
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:08,300
uh...

424
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:11,634
...by the way dad... umm...

425
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,535
Some investors have
come down from London...

426
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,134
...and they have pots of money...

427
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,102
and they wish to invest some
money in television news industry...

428
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,301
...so i recommended India 24l7

429
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,301
...Jay, i have asked
them to meet you...

430
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,801
...Naveen, a news channel
should not accept...

431
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,567
...from any one...

432
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,934
...any kind of favors at all...

433
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:35,967
Where is there any
favors in this dad?

434
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,234
They are my friends...

435
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:38,800
...they trust my word...

436
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,067
They will do it for me...

437
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,801
Whether someone
is doing for you...

438
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:43,801
or you're doing it for
some one is immaterial...

439
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:47,635
No one does anything for anybody
without personal interests...

440
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:50,800
there are no free lunches...

441
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:55,067
...give me some curry...

442
00:22:58,933 --> 00:22:59,733
SOrry...

443
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,101
Look at this picture
very closely...

444
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,667
this accident happened yesterday

445
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:13,602
When while fielding, our
budding star cricketer...

446
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:15,968
...Hansrai Singh
Suddenly got unconscious...

447
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,534
What is the reason...

448
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:20,869
that the young blood who we
expect to be fit and strong...

449
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,169
while playing for India...
just collapse and fall down?

450
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,668
Why is India's glorious
image getting tarnished...

451
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,668
why is the young
generation getting ruined?

452
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:31,469
To find out more about it watch
our tonight's special feature...

453
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:34,001
...Mummy see, your
son is getting spoilt...

454
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,835
Mummy see... Mummy see... Mummy
see... your son is getting spoilt...

455
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,167
How was it?

456
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,902
Trivedi, I have told
you earlier too...

457
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:44,102
that is don't like such
presentations... - Purab?

458
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,935
...wonder if he
saw me from behind...

459
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:50,933
yes sir?

460
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,902
I saw your investigative
story on Encounter cops...

461
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:58,134
intelligent...

462
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,501
...insightful...

463
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:02,033
...and brilliant...

464
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,901
...I wont say 'Best
of Luck' to you...

465
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,434
...more than luck...

466
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:13,568
...you seem to be a person
who stands on his confidence.

467
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:14,834
Ok... All the best...

468
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,635
Jay every show has
a unique identity...

469
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,770
I am afraid if you stretch it
too far it will lose its effect...

470
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,469
...and I am afraid that
India 24l7 might shut down...

471
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,568
If we don't do something today...

472
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:43,835
...tomorrow we might not get
a chance to even do anything...

473
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,901
...Dad, I know your
principles very well...

474
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,901
...Keeping them in mind
I have planned all this...

475
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:50,933
...and dad...

476
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:52,967
...every one is
quite convinced...

477
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,668
...that these changes are
fantastic for India 24l7.

478
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Fantastic... Dad...

479
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,336
Dad... don't mind me
saying this but...

480
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,667
...along with principles...

481
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,367
...people are working for us...

482
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,535
...and should we not look
after their salaries too dad?

483
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:16,334
Trust me dad... we
are not compromising...

484
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,701
...Just changing a
little bit... that's it...

485
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,867
...iust a little...

486
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,035
...Jay I do not agree
with your changes...

487
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,467
...but...

488
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,736
...we got practical problems...

489
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:39,335
see as long as we do
not compromise...

490
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,634
...on India 24l7's principles...

491
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,935
No way dad... no way...

492
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:46,334
...no principle
will be compromised...

493
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:47,800
...i can assure you that.

494
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,367
...are you sure?

495
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:55,466
Super sure dad...

496
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:59,435
...I believe that every
show has a unique identity...

497
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,769
and what you propose to do might
reduce the effect of the show...

498
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:07,302
...lts a matter of
need and not effect...

499
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,868
but if it is not effective
how will it fulfil needs?

500
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,501
In order to increase
the viewer ship,

501
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:16,467
if we play with our
existing shows...

502
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,535
...then we will even lose the
viewer ship that exists now...

503
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,836
How long ago did you
join this industry?

504
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:29,469
What difference does that
make? To know these things...

505
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,535
...one doesn't always
require experience.

506
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:34,268
I accept that I am
new to the industry...

507
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,601
...but have been a
viewer since a long time...

508
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:36,900
you mean to say...

509
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,467
...I do not
understand things here?

510
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:39,500
...is that what you
are trying to say?

511
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:40,433
No no...

512
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,967
...you know better then me...

513
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,301
...but you are seeing
only what you want to see...

514
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:47,368
Could you iust shut up?

515
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:52,302
Don't forget you are iust
an employee in this channel.

516
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,468
...and to speak against
us... - One minute...

517
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:57,769
Please don't think of my
disagreement as my disloyalty...

518
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,435
I know... that I am
just an employee...

519
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:02,967
maybe you might not believe me...

520
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,536
but I too am keenly interested
in the progress of India 24l7...

521
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,467
...as much as you are...

522
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,267
I have said what I had to say...

523
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,300
...let Dad decide.

524
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,934
Jay is right...

525
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,401
is there anything
else you wish to say?

fifty five minutes

543

00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:55,236
Jay listen... Headlines 24

You know how it is now a days

And everybody is a bloody
walking talking spy camera...

00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:27,067
...its impossible
to keep a secret.

557
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,468
Maybe Amrish Khakkar thought
the very same idea too...

558
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:32,500

That you organised
this lovely party...

675
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:53,035
because otherwise Viiayii
just doesn't meet anyone...

676
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,401
...and a person
like me... never...

677
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,670
I am really not that bad
a person as you think...

678
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:03,702

Thank you Naveen.

684
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:19,435
Pandeii, I can neither
speak good of you... or bad...

685
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:22,368
It is beyond Media's principles
to speak in favor or against...

686
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,767
You are you...

687
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:29,134
Media is media...

688
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:32,801
There's a vast difference...

689
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,100
Really...

690
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,133
Anyway...

topic some other time.

692
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,968

700
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,901
Mallik Sir is getting old...

701
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,201
After all... Son steps
in fathers shoes. Right?

702
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,034

703
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:22,267

704
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:25,868
Launch another show
in your channel...

705
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:30,067
you'll get more TRP.

706
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,334
Ya... thanks for the idea
...even though its mine.

707
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,868
Son steps in fathers shoes...

708
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,000
And as things are...

709
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:38,234
...lndia 24l7 is iust
not used to great TRP.

710
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:43,302
Why don't you iust shut up?

711
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:46,001
Oh iay... this is not happening.

712
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:48,033
You know...

713
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,235
Such attitude...
doesn't suit losers...

714
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,002
you should be careful when you
talk or else the people, whom...

715
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,868
...you have borrowed
all the money from...

716
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,735
...I iust have to make them a
phone call 8 you with your channel

717
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,301
...will be out on streets...

718
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:04,567
Jay... iay what are you doing...

719
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,701
Jay... Let go Jay... Leave it...

720
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:15,802
I love you too man...
Ma'am, Pleasure meeting you.

721
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:20,800
Are you ok? - I m fine.

722
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,667
I m fine... - Ya...

723
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,067
Can you please get me a drink?

724
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:30,267
Yes... - Thanks.

725
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,234
If you want it...

726
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:46,535
Amrish khakkar will never again
dare speak with you this way...

727
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:50,300
If you want it...

728
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,703
If you want it India 24l7s
TRPs will become so high...

729
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,635
...it would wipe out
Headlines 24 completely...

730
00:38:58,966 --> 00:39:00,100
If you really want it.

731
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,101
If you really want it...

732
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:06,468
...then along with India 24l7...

733
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:09,767
...Entire Indian Media
will be under your control.

734
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:18,500
How?

735
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:22,700
How?

736
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:29,505
This... Muzzaffarnagar... Bomb
blast that recently happened...

737
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,501
Do you know...

738
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:37,534
who's actually did it?

739
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,068
Digviiay Hooda.

740
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:49,502
Its a clever plot of his...

741
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,868
to plant fear in
hearts of people...

742
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,504
and use it to get
the new bill passed.

743
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:04,900
How can you be so sure...

744
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,468
...that Hooda has done it?

745
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,468
Hooda has not done it Jay...

746
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,735
...it should seem
like he's done it.

747
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:14,633
What do you Mean?

748
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,501
I mean the world has changed.

749
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,668
Earlier TV channel's
used to show...

750
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:20,568
...incidents that happened.

751
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:22,667
They used to report.

752
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:24,100
But now...

753
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:26,634
intelligence and technology...

754
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,801
both have evolved
to such an extent...

755
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:31,068
You can actually create news.

756
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:33,167
That's where you come in Jay.

757
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,067
But according to the law...

758
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,467
its treason.

759
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:00,534
Law...

760
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:05,134
Laws were not made by God
sitting above in heaven...

761
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,468
laws were made here on land.

762
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:13,871
To prevent ordinary men
from becoming great men...

763
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,838
Some very special
people like me...

764
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:20,833
...have made these laws...

765
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,636
And while making them
great care was taken...

766
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,535
...that we don't
get trapped by them.

767
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:33,935
You see Jay... we have
6 other channels...

768
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:37,535
who are willing to do
anything for this offer.

769
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,434
Right Pandey? Um Hmmm

770
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,901
6 other channels.

771
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:44,502
But we want India
24l7 to report this.

772
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:46,600
Why?

773
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:50,603
When you want to bring down the
Country's most reputed leader...

774
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:56,570
...put against him the country's
most reputed media personality

775
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,367
...and we have a winner...

776
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,000
...in this case...

777
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:06,066
...its your Dad.

778
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:16,069
Jay, by the time things
are are investigated...

779
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:19,367
It will be too late.

780
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,567
But if your Dad...

781
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,768
whom everyone regards as
the country's cleanest...

782
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,834
...most Reputed' Journalist...

783
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:27,367
...when he will report this...

784
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,335
It will shatter
peoples faith in Hooda.

785
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,667
Jay you need TRPs.

786
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:40,368
Besides the 30 crore loan that
you have taken from the market...

787
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,034
...We will pay it off...

788
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:43,900
and... and that's not all...

789
00:42:43,966 --> 00:42:46,735
Pandey promises to give
you... Another 100 crores.

790
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:48,333
Yes.

791
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,369
Ideal Deal is one
which benefits both.

792
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,502
All your troubles will
be over in one shot...

793
00:43:00,966 --> 00:43:02,434
Think about it...

794
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:09,833
One more thing...

795
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,868
...if your stupidity...

796
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:16,701
...or your conscience...

797
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,268
...stops you from ioining us...

798
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,803
...you better stop
your tongue too...

799
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:30,836
because there are some reasons...
why I am the Mohan Pandey...

800
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,667
Where did you go?

801
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:08,202
You know how many
times I called you?

802
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,701
And you were iust
not picking up.

803
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:13,800
__y

804
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,434
Jay...

805
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:35,700
Jay what happened?

806
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,200
Hmm?

807
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,434
You made the right decision.

808
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:13,235
Now we have to
arrange for a man...

809
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,770
whom we can show
along with Atul Kumar Dubey.

810
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:30,400
All of India knows it.

811
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,601
If Atul kumar Dubey
is Hooda's man...

812
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,168
Why would he favor us?

813
00:45:37,433 --> 00:45:39,234
With a gun pointing
to your head...

814
00:45:39,866 --> 00:45:41,701
...you can make
anyone say anything.

815
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:45,667
Gun point?

816
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,668
Let Pandey handle
all that... ok?

817
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,234
But... - Hmmm?

818
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,601
We cant hold him at
Gun point for ever...

819
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:59,501
No... of course
not... of course not...

820
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:01,768
But Pandey will come out
with some say to do it...

821
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,368
By threatening to kill
his family members...

822
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,502
...or offer him pots of money.
Or use some other pressure...

823
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,167
Whatever... whatever... whatever...

824
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,700
...See...

825
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:13,568
...by then our
job will be done...

826
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,400
Believe me...

827
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:19,469
Pandey is much more experienced
in these matters than us.

828
00:46:19,766 --> 00:46:22,101
...he knows a lot...
ok? ...Trust me.

829
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:23,667
Because I trust Pandey.

830
00:46:23,766 --> 00:46:25,567
But Jeeiu, will this look real?

831
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,234
Sometimes you make me laugh.

832
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,701
You are Media people. ^

833
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,368
Do you know how films are made?

834
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:38,468
Just think... that you
are going to make a film.

835
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:40,300
Ok? A short film.

836
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:42,200
A 5 minute short film.

837
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,202
No spice... No song... no Dance...

838
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,534
Straight to the point.

839
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,167
Don't worry...

840
00:46:56,766 --> 00:46:58,467
In the Muzzaffarnagar
bomb blast case...

841
00:46:58,533 --> 00:47:00,368
...a criminal called
Abdul has been arrested...

842
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,201
According to
Police, Abdul named...

843
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:04,334
a person called Khanna
during the interrogation...

844
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,303
Abdul confessed that Khanna had
paid him 50 lacs for this job...

845
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:11,201
Police is now
searching for Khanna...

846
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:13,100
But who is this Khanna?

847
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:14,166
Dad...

848
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:15,633
Guess what i got?

849
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,002
Hooda saheb had become
nervous and unsure...

850
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:21,301
...he said not
even 100 people die?

851
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:24,701
The purpose why we
did this bomb blast...

852
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:26,634
...will it be fulfilled?

853
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,337
But these news channel
made so much noise...

854
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:33,034
...that our iob was done.

855
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:35,101
So is Hooda happy now?

856
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:36,333
Very happy...

857
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,534
What is all this Jay?

858
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:39,301
I was shocked too dad.

859
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,701
He is the same Khanna that
everyone is searching for dad.

860
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:43,600
Same guy.

861
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:49,201
Whe... where did
you find this CD?

862
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,501
Some one sent it dad...
Addressed to me... I mean...

863
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,168
We should air this Right
Now Dad. - No... No... No...

864
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:55,767
What?

865
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,535
To accuse a leader like Hooda
is not a... - What you talking dad?

866
00:47:59,266 --> 00:48:00,500
What are you talking dad?

867
00:48:00,566 --> 00:48:02,935
Lts obvious from this that
Hooda made that bomb blast happen

868
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,935
...and this Atul Kumar Dubey,
who is talking with Khanna...

869
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:08,368
...is one of Hoodas special
guys. Every one knows that.

870
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:10,101
Everybody knows
that... including you.

871
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:13,135
Ya but without any proof
how can you? - What proof dad?

872
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:15,968
What proof are you
talking about dad?

873
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:18,467
Which proof are
you talking about?

874
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:20,200
We're Media people dad

875
00:48:20,266 --> 00:48:21,967
And its our iob to
put what ever truth

876
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,467
that we find in
front of everyone...

877
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,000
This is the truth dad...

878
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:27,500
This is the truth.

879
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:30,400
And dad... by the way...

880
00:48:30,566 --> 00:48:33,068
...whoever has
sent us this tape...

881
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,401
...its quite possible...
...rather I am sure that...

882
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,502
...he must have sent this
truth to other channels too...

883
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:41,000
Dad...

884
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:43,434
...we are running out of time...

885
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:46,401
...running out of time dad...

886
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,101
Not for me... Not for yourself...

887
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:00,334
...not for India 24l7...

888
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:04,502
...but only for the
people of the country...

889
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,335
you have to expose
this at once dad.

890
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,168
You owe this to
the country dad...

891
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:19,503
You... owe... this...
to the country.

892
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:24,900
Dad?

893
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,433
Ya...

894
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,400
Yes Dad.

895
00:49:31,566 --> 00:49:34,302
Government is on the verge of
acquiring unlimited power...

896
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:37,202
...in order to tackle
crime and terrorism.

897
00:49:38,466 --> 00:49:41,602
Its a matter of pride that the
prime minister of the country

898
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,168
...has tightened his
belt to tackle terrorism...

899
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:46,134
But I am sad to say this...

900
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,002
...that all this
was just a facade...

901
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,068
a trick... a lie...

902
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,234
What you are about to see now...

903
00:49:53,933 --> 00:49:55,134
...is actual terrorism...

904
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,902
It is the fea_ul aspect of
Indian Political scenario.

905
00:49:57,966 --> 00:49:59,600
Which is more terrifying
then terrorism.

906
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,002
India 24l7 presents...

907
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:02,967
'A truth'

908
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,501
Hooda saheb had become
nervous and unsure...

909
00:50:06,366 --> 00:50:08,067
...he said not
even 100 people die?

910
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:12,068
The purpose why we
did this bomb blast...

911
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,868
...will it be fulfilled?

912
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:18,469
But the channels made
such a big noise...

913
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,336
...that our iob was done...
So is Hooda happy now?

914
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:23,866
Very happy...

915
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:29,370
he told me give
khanna another 5 crore

916
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:30,500
WOW...

917
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:32,901
It will reach along with this...

918
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:35,100
Thank you Dubey...

919
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,433
This is iust great...

920
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,869
and tell Hooda Saheb if he
needs to do something again...

921
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:42,902
...then remember
khanna... - Sure I will sir.

922
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,002
We all know who
Atul Kumar Dubey is...

923
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,434
Member of Parliament...

924
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:50,634
...and the most
loyal old friend of...

925
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,401
Digviiay Hooda
since many years...

926
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,935
All this makes it a good
enough reason for us...

927
00:50:56,133 --> 00:51:01,505
to believe every word that Dubey
spoke for his friend Hooda...

928
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:03,901
ya... Why didn't I get this tape?

929
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:06,301
I didn't know about this
at all... I had no clue...

930
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,468
Today I wont plead
you to think...

931
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:12,867
I am confident...

932
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,868
That you have seen everything...

933
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:16,033
...absorbed it...

934
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:17,334
...and understood it too.

935
00:51:17,466 --> 00:51:19,801
In breaking news today we
will show you a video clip...

936
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,938
The facts exposed by India 24l7
has shaken the public 8 the VIPs

937
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:37,835
Digviiay Hoodas one of
those chosen few leaders...

938
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:41,169
...who had built a clean
image of an ideal politician...

939
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:43,401
on the platform
of Indian politics.

940
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:46,268
But now that Image has
been shattered to pieces.

941
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,336
The picture that has su_aced of
prime minister Digvijay Hooda...

942
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:50,867
...is certainly fearsome.

943
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,302
Viiay Harshvardhan Mallik
and his son Jay Mallik...

944
00:51:53,366 --> 00:51:55,868
...under whose supervision
this operation was executed...

945
00:51:55,933 --> 00:51:57,434
...has caused tremors
through the political world.

946
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,236
We have iust been informed
that the police has found...

947
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,435
...member of parliament and
Digvijay Hooda's dear friend...

948
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,301
Atul kumar Dubey's corpse.

949
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:06,734
He has been murdered.

950
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,400
I don't know any Khanna.

951
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:30,235
But do you accept that
you knew Atul Kumar Dubey?

952
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,936
Atul Kumar Dubey, was
one of my close friends.

953
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:36,067
Atul Kumar Dubey
was your friend...

954
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:37,434
...and Khanna was his friend...

955
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,236
...so doesn't friend of a
friend, become your friend too?

956
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,768
No. Absolutely not.

957
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:44,901
For a moment lets assume...

958
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,168
...that Atul Kumar
Dubey knew Khanna...

959
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:49,134
...then it doesn't
necessarily mean that...

960
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,934
...I too was
associated with Khanna.

961
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:58,770
In our breaking news Digviiay
Hooda accepted the truth.

962
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:01,368
Hear it once again... carefully...

963
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:05,236
Atul Kumar Dubey, was
one of my close friends.

964
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,101
...was one of my close friends.

965
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:10,668
I too was associated
with Khanna...

966
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:12,801
I too was associated
with Khanna...

967
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:14,434
I too was associated
with Khanna...

968
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:17,069
Atul Kumar Dubey knew Khanna...

969
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:20,035
Atul Kumar Dubey
was his close friend.

970
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,734
The prime character
of Prime minister

971
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,034
Digviiay Hoodas
sting operation...

972
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,201
...Khanna, is missing.

973
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:27,769
Entire Nation is put on
stand... where is Khanna?

974
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,068
This revelation has
ripped open the curtains...

975
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:31,968
covering the corrupt
political links.

976
00:53:32,033 --> 00:53:33,834
Is Khanna really missing?

977
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:35,901
...or is he being hidden?

978
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:37,867
The famous film maker
Bobby Bhatt has announced...

979
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:40,268
...that his next film is
entirely based on this scandal.

980
00:53:40,433 --> 00:53:43,302
Sir we are again asking
you, where is Khanna?

981
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:45,134
Welcome to our programme
special' Who is Khanna'.

982
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:47,068
The biggest character
of this entire conspiracy

983
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:48,400
Khanna... where is he?

984
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:52,669
Hooda repeatedly claims he does
not know anybody called Khanna.

985
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:20,834
The more deadly a crime...

986
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,635
the more dangerous methods
are used to hide it.

987
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:26,234
And when the person
responsible for collapse

988
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,868
...of the government disappears...

989
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:30,902
...then you can iudge the extent
to which the criminal has gone.

990
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:33,334
Where is Khanna?

991
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:37,902
But more then that, its
necessary to ask who is Khanna?

992
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,236
Dubey and Khanna...

993
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,302
Their existance could have
become dangerous for us.

994
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:52,001
That's is why Pandey had to...

995
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:56,867
Jay...

996
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:00,702
There are two kind of
people in this world.

997
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,802
Lions... and Lambs.

998
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,968
In order to rule...

999
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:09,968
Its necessary for Lion
to sacrifice few lambs.

1000
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:13,601
You want to be a Lion or a lamb?

1001
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:17,235
You have to make this
decision for yourself.

1002
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:21,169
But, after you
make the decision...

1003
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:27,070
It would only be stupidity...
to waste time on lambs.

1004
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:32,533
Get me a drink

1005
00:55:32,566 --> 00:55:35,168
lts a battle... Its a battle.

1006
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:36,733
Its a battle...

1007
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:40,902
Its a battle... Its a battle.

1008
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,035
Its a battle...

1009
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,470
Wow, I have never seen your
Vijay Sir this happy before.

1010
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:38,800
Purab?

1011
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:43,800
What happened?

1012
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:47,600
What happened?

1013
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,501
Khanna was present
at Vijay Sirs party.

1014
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:54,500
Who Khanna?

1015
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,034
That... Hooda's man?

1016
00:56:58,533 --> 00:56:59,700
I saw him at the party.

1017
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:02,101
But, how can you be so sure?

1018
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:03,600
When I saw him on TV...

1019
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:05,534
I got a feeling I had definitely
seen him somewhere before.

1020
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,702
Then I remembered I had
seen him at Vijay Sirs party.

1021
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,134
Purab have you gone mad?

1022
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:12,001
How can you be so
confident that...

1023
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:13,600
Khanna was present
at that party.

1024
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:15,634
These are few
photographs of the party...

1025
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:23,601
Viiay Sir or one of
his family members...

1026
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:25,067
might have invited
him to the party.

1027
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:28,101
Or maybe he came
along with some guest.

1028
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:30,533
With whom?

1029
00:57:31,133 --> 00:57:32,868
Maybe with Mohan Pandey.

1030
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,036
No... Purab, listen to me.

1031
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,401
There's no need to play
Sherlock Holmes in this mess.

1032
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:42,168
Police is searching for
Khanna... let them do their job.

1033
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,868
You iust do your iob.
Better still leave this job.

1034
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:47,168
Purab did you hear what I said?

1035
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:56,401
Who besides Mohan Pandey...

1036
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:59,002
gets the maximum benefit
of Hooda being removed?

1037
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,003
We were searching for
terrorists outside the country...

1038
00:58:03,366 --> 00:58:07,636
...as we did not expect them
to be right here amongst us.

1039
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:12,804
We trusted him with our safety
and the future of the country.

1040
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,667
And he did this?

1041
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,836
To tell you the truth...

1042
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:28,337
...I am deeply ashamed to stand
here in front of all of you...

1043
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:30,334
No, I have done nothing...

1044
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,002
I am not guilty...

1045
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:35,834
But yet I find it difficult
to hold my head up...

1046
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:38,434
Since I too am a leader.

1047
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:41,635
And this word 'leader' is...

1048
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:45,370
now associated with
traitors like Hooda.

1049
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:50,670
You might be thinking I have
come here to ask for your votes...

1050
00:58:51,566 --> 00:58:55,803
No... I do not want your vote.

1051
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,002
Mohan Pandey does not want Vote.

1052
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:02,569
Mohan Pandey does
not want Politics.

1053
00:59:02,633 --> 00:59:05,602
Does not want to be a leader.
Does not even want the throne.

1054
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:10,737
Then what does this
Mohan Pandey want?

1055
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:12,868
Mohan Pandey wants...

1056
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:18,571
...this country to be safe
from Hounds like Hooda.

1057
00:59:18,866 --> 00:59:19,766
That's it.

1058
00:59:19,966 --> 00:59:24,603
Today the country does
not need this Mohan Pandey.

1059
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,602
But Mohan Pandey
needs this country...

1060
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:32,469
A county where there
is peace in the hearts...

1061
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,869
and truth on its lips.

1062
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:54,169
Telecast this speech every 10
minutes. Through out the day?

1063
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:58,070
Pandey Does not want Leadership
Does not want this chair either

1064
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,968
It looks as if India
24l7 has turned into...

1065
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:04,701
...a private PR channel
for Mohan Pandey.

1066
01:00:05,566 --> 01:00:09,002
After Hoodas scandal Pandey's
Popularity has increased dad...

1067
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:12,769
People want to hear more of
him... People want to see him...

1068
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,801
...and I think we are iust showing
people what they want to see.

1069
01:00:14,866 --> 01:00:16,867
There's... I don't see
anything wrong with that.

1070
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:20,001
Besides he's getting
us great ratings...

1071
01:00:21,866 --> 01:00:23,500
And dad... umm...

1072
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:26,668
...There's nothing at
all... as it seems to you...

1073
01:00:27,566 --> 01:00:28,733
I think we are all ok.

1074
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:31,934
See you around dad.

1075
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:40,100
Dad... uh...

1076
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:44,569
...There's something I wanted
to speak with you about... Can I?

1077
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,633
Um... hmm

1078
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:50,003
I had introduced you to a
girl on your birthday party...

1079
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:52,033
Yas.

1080
01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:54,567
Yashoda...

1081
01:00:55,033 --> 01:00:56,734
You remember her? - Ya.

1082
01:00:58,733 --> 01:00:59,600
Uh...

1083
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,100
I want to marry her...

1084
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:05,033
I love her...

1085
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:06,733
...and um...

1086
01:01:06,933 --> 01:01:08,034
...and she's a Muslim.

1087
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:09,901
Marriage is not iust
about boy and girl...

1088
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,667
...its about their families too...

1089
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,568
Its not only Jay
she has to be with...

1090
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:14,934
She has to be part of us too...

1091
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,434
I wont let a girl from
another faith to be part of...

1092
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:19,634
What do you know
about her faith?

1093
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:22,835
As far as I know... you
have never read the Quran...

1094
01:01:23,033 --> 01:01:24,134
Why should I read it?

1095
01:01:25,066 --> 01:01:27,835
All I know is, our
religions are different...

1096
01:01:28,566 --> 01:01:30,868
Then will you tell me what's
different between us and her?

1097
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:32,701
What do you mean
what's different?

1098
01:01:33,766 --> 01:01:35,434
We go to temple...
they go to mosque...

1099
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,667
We celebrate Diwali while
they celebrate... - Eid...

1100
01:01:39,466 --> 01:01:40,633
...they celebrate Eid.

1101
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:44,535
Iust like you like wearing
a Sari, Priya doesn't...

1102
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,169
You don't like spice in
your dal curry and Naveen...

1103
01:01:49,866 --> 01:01:51,667
Naveen does not
even like dal curry...

1104
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:55,536
We all are of the same religion...
then why are we so different?

1105
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:58,101
Don't try to manipulate
me with your thoughts...

1106
01:01:58,366 --> 01:01:59,700
...lts not about thoughts lata.

1107
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,835
...lts about understanding...
We are different people...

1108
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,368
We have our own way of living...

1109
01:02:05,566 --> 01:02:07,634
...every 'way' is a religion...

1110
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,734
Naveen according to his
religion... me according to mine...

1111
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,469
you according to yours and
Yasmeen according to her religion...

1112
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:13,734
...are living life...

1113
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,368
There are no Hindus or Muslims...

1114
01:02:17,566 --> 01:02:19,668
...there are only 'People'.

1115
01:02:20,033 --> 01:02:24,003
Just understand that you are
not just being against muslims...

1116
01:02:24,066 --> 01:02:25,801
...you are also being
against Jay's love...

1117
01:02:32,033 --> 01:02:34,101
Hail India... Hail Hail India...

1118
01:02:34,366 --> 01:02:36,468
Hail India... Hail Hail India...

1119
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:38,835
90 out of 100 are
bloody dihonest...

1120
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,835
Commit animal fodder
scams... yet walk proud.

1121
01:02:45,466 --> 01:02:47,801
90 out of 100 are
bloody dishonest...

1122
01:02:47,866 --> 01:02:49,901
Commit animal fodder
scams... yet walk proud.

1123
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,034
The ones with might...
their wrongs become right...

1124
01:02:53,933 --> 01:02:57,970
My India is Great...
India is Great...

1125
01:02:58,533 --> 01:03:03,037
My India is Great...
Praise it... Praise it...

1126
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,537
My India is Great...
Praise it... Praise it...

1127
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,336
My India is Great...
India is Great...

1128
01:03:10,466 --> 01:03:11,300
Hi mam...

1129
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:14,002
I am making a documentary on
Mr. Vijay Harshvardhan Mallik.

1130
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:15,867
And a book will be
published on it too...

1131
01:03:15,933 --> 01:03:18,435
your company did the event
management for his birthday.

1132
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:22,302
Can you give me the guest list
of the invitees to the party?

1133
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:24,468
...It will be a great help
if I can have those details.

1134
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:27,501
Other buys votes
and moves ahead...

1135
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:29,835
A leader speaks the truth...

1136
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,335
only when he calls
another leader a liar

1137
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,902
My India is Great...

1138
01:03:34,966 --> 01:03:36,567
I love...

1139
01:03:36,633 --> 01:03:39,702
My India is Great

1140
01:03:41,066 --> 01:03:44,035
My India is Great

1141
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,567
I love...

1142
01:03:45,633 --> 01:03:48,402
My India is Great

1143
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:50,334
I love my India

1144
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,568
Gandhi... Gandhi...
Gandhi... Gandhi

1145
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:55,268
Gandhi... Gandhi...
Salute... Salute...

1146
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:59,669
Gandhi... Gandhi...
Gandhi... Gandhi

1147
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,702
Gandhi... Gandhi...
Gandhi... Gandhi

1148
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:08,867
4 Khannas came to the party...

1149
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:11,802
But the Khanna everyone is
searching for is not amongst them...

1150
01:04:12,633 --> 01:04:15,669
That means Khanna came to the
party along with some guest...

1151
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,868
Or maybe Khanna is not
his real name at all...

1152
01:04:20,466 --> 01:04:22,768
Why would anybody use his real
name for such an operation?

1153
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,334
Purab have you gone mad?

1154
01:04:24,466 --> 01:04:27,235
Don't you know how dangerous
people like Mohan Pandey are?

1155
01:04:27,566 --> 01:04:29,768
They will finish you off and
no one will ever come to know.

1156
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,234
Iust... iust like
they whisked off...

1157
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,734
...Khanna they will
whisk you off too

1158
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:35,935
Please Purab if
not for yourself...

1159
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,668
For my sake please
stop all this...

1160
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:42,468
...and what's worse
is that India 24l7...

1161
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:45,302
Just goes on praising
that Monster Pandey.

1162
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:47,267
I cant believe it...

1163
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:49,234
We're not talking about
the movie karz (debt)...

1164
01:04:50,866 --> 01:04:52,701
...and recently Himesh
Reshammiya acted in.

1165
01:04:52,866 --> 01:04:55,201
We're talking about
the debt in which you...

1166
01:04:55,233 --> 01:04:56,667
and me are slowly drowning in

1167
01:04:56,866 --> 01:04:58,701
look very very closely
around you my friends

1168
01:04:58,766 --> 01:05:00,501
you'll realize the
credit card companies...

1169
01:05:00,566 --> 01:05:01,867
have become our financiers...

1170
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:03,934
and we are entrapped
by their smart marketing

1171
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:05,467
and have become 'debtors'

1172
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:06,700
and that's not all...

1173
01:05:06,766 --> 01:05:09,602
...some of the
companies are hiring...

1174
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,534
...underworld to recover debts...

1175
01:05:11,633 --> 01:05:14,335
You will never know when
a AK47 totting Goon...

1176
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,369
Will pop up in front of you...
...and then pop you off...

1177
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:19,735
Keep watching our
special feature...

1178
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,769
Bleed dry... become
paupers... in this debt.

1179
01:05:25,266 --> 01:05:28,168
I am planning to launch 2
more channels soon... - Ok Sir...

1180
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,603
Both the channels will be hard
core entertainment... - fine sir...

1181
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:34,868
exactly your kind... - Yes Sir...

1182
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:36,400
Nalini... - hmm?

1183
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,168
Pandey wants to give an
exclusive interview to India 24l7

1184
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:40,167
...will you look at it?

1185
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:41,434
Ya, sure -Ya... ok sir...

1186
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:45,168
Pandey, for past 30 years you
have been involved in politics...

1187
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:49,170
um hmm... Politics is a
wrong and also a dirty word...

1188
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:52,235
instead say 'National Worker'...
I am a Public servant...

1189
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:54,501
The way things are
going it seems...

1190
01:05:54,699 --> 01:05:56,535
...you might be the
next prime minister...

1191
01:05:57,466 --> 01:05:59,434
...what new measures will
you do for the country?

1192
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:01,167
Name...

1193
01:06:01,733 --> 01:06:04,135
Purab... - Purab first of all...

1194
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,870
we will win the battles
we are fighting...

1195
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:10,233
what battle?

1196
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,301
Battle against terrorism...

1197
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,268
Corruption... Poverty...

1198
01:06:15,533 --> 01:06:18,369
...battle against dirty
politics... we will win it.

1199
01:06:18,733 --> 01:06:21,235
Pandey Sir, we have
heard these words before...

1200
01:06:21,699 --> 01:06:23,101
...every politician...

1201
01:06:23,133 --> 01:06:24,734
...I mean... every
National Worker...

1202
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,301
...makes similar claims
during elections...

1203
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,768
...We would like to hear
something new from you.

1204
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:33,635
Farmers who are
committing suicides...

1205
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,435
We've heard that too
before Pandey sir...

1206
01:06:36,566 --> 01:06:37,466
Terrorism...

1207
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:40,602
I declare against it a... - We've
heard this too Pandey Sir.

1208
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:43,134
Say something new...

1209
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,869
What 'new new' are you ranting
about? Old problems still exist...

1210
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:48,402
what new can one do?
- Problems are old but...

1211
01:06:49,133 --> 01:06:51,134
...solutions can be
new... right Pandey Sir?

1212
01:06:53,433 --> 01:06:54,367
Pandey sir...

1213
01:06:55,066 --> 01:06:57,134
...you spoke about waging
a war against criminals...

1214
01:06:58,066 --> 01:07:00,401
...what will you do to the
criminals who are in politics?

1215
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:02,201
We will finish them...

1216
01:07:02,633 --> 01:07:03,567
Yourself too?

1217
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:05,467
What?

1218
01:07:05,766 --> 01:07:07,501
Since 1972 till today...

1219
01:07:08,266 --> 01:07:10,601
102 cases are
registered against you...

1220
01:07:12,033 --> 01:07:13,634
amongst them... 34
are criminal cases...

1221
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:15,567
25 land dispute cases...

1222
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,169
...and the rest are fraud and
foreign exchange violations.

1223
01:07:18,433 --> 01:07:19,734
What could be the reason...

1224
01:07:20,233 --> 01:07:22,234
...that so many cases
are registered against...

1225
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,168
a clean national
worker like you?
