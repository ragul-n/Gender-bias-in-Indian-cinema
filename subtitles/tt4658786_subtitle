1
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:34,813
Madam, open the door.

2
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:37,815
Open the door!

3
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:41,868
That's surprising.

4
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,334
Madam, open the door!

5
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,128
What's the matter?
- Open the door, Kadambari!

6
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:48,109
Open the door, Kadambari!
- Let me see.

7
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,081
Kadambari?

8
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,143
She never does that.
I don't understand.

9
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:52,472
Kadambari, open the door.

10
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,107
Since early morning..

11
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:55,634
I first thought..
- I wonder what..

12
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,394
Kadambari, listen to me.

13
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,806
What should I do?

14
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,019
Break it open.
- Break the door!

15
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,227
Break it open.

16
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:15,628
Kadambari!

17
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:18,319
What's the matter?

18
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:20,381
What..

19
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:31,991
Call the doctor.

20
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,694
Quick.

21
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:54,647
Sister-in-law!

22
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:29,653
The women of our family
don't end up in morgues.

23
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:34,204
Father, newspapers..

24
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,614
No paper is to carry this news.

25
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:39,582
The coroner's court is to
be held right here

26
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,497
whatever the cost.

27
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:46,856
Forensics must testify this
to be a natural death.

28
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:51,761
Brief all the
servants accordingly.

29
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:28,332
'1868, 5th July, Sunday.'

30
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,177
'My wedding day.'

31
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,560
'It was like being swept off
from a tiny pond'

32
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,646
'right into the ocean waves.'

33
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:56,958
'That was how I felt when I came
to Thakurbari as a newlywed.'

34
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:37,296
'My husband Jyotirindranath
was more than just handsome.'

35
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,197
'Bright intelligent eyes.'

36
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:46,211
'Taste and culture written
all over his tall frame.'

37
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:48,731
'I was awestruck.'

38
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:51,389
'I was too young
to feel anything else.'

39
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:25,522
'Father-in-law blessed me
with gold coins.'

40
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,147
'The bride however
was sitting coyly'

41
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:32,392
'and yet he didn't escape her
eyes among all that crowd.'

42
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:35,346
'A little boy peeking
from behind a pillar.'

43
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,111
'He was staring with wonder
at the new bride.'

44
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,377
'I used to sit and wonder'

45
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:52,081
'as to how the sound of the
cotton shredder's twangs'

46
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:55,404
'blended with the
wrestlers' humps.'

47
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,438
'While others took a nap
in the afternoon'

48
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,656
'I had a lovely time
chatting with'

49
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,164
'the house tailor Niyamat Khan.'

50
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:16,748
'What is muslin...
where is zari-work done.'

51
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:20,292
'I had a thousand questions
that amused Niyamat.'

52
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,814
'He loved to rile me.'

53
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:57,093
'I too pretended to be miffed.'

54
00:06:57,715 --> 00:07:02,814
'I would yearn to talk to
someone freely in that mansion'

55
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,231
'ultimately I found a friend.'

56
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,106
'Robi.'

57
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:07,271
Mango preserve.

58
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,694
Hey, you went to
the terrace to eat it.

59
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,599
I was scaring off the crows.

60
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:16,249
Scaring crows indeed. Take it.

61
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:22,606
One will do?
Come on, take more.

62
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,647
'Thus the Ten-Headed
one did weep.'

63
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,645
'Streams of tears his
face did steep.'

64
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,981
'The father's grief
saddens the son.'

65
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:34,272
'Rishis flaunt their
power over Ravan.'

66
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:37,189
'Holding Indra, Yama,
Varuna in disregard.'

67
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,658
'For a man to prevail
is a deed unheard.'

68
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,200
Where have you hidden it?
Give it to me.

69
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:06,772
What?

70
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:09,772
You know what I mean.
Give it back quick.

71
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:12,965
Am I your watchman,
here to guard your things?

72
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,801
Leave it. Come on.

73
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:23,599
No need to be my watchman.

74
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,088
Just keep your hands
to yourself.

75
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:30,481
'Elder sister-in-law.
Gyanodanandini.'

76
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:33,689
'My elder brother-in-law
Satyen Thakur's wife'

77
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:38,064
'was a real beauty
with wonderful taste'

78
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:40,231
'in the way she
spoke and dressed.'

79
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:42,772
'She was different
from the rest.'

80
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:46,189
'She wore her sarees like
no one else I had ever seen.'

81
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,122
Come on.

82
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,487
'She said aristocratic women
in west India'

83
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:51,564
'wore sarees this way.'

84
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:54,285
'She felt that
alongside education'

85
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:57,145
'Bengali women would do well
to adopt'

86
00:08:57,275 --> 00:09:00,304
'the dressing style to let
their personalities flourish.'

87
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:01,989
What is it?

88
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,044
Sis-in-law, will you teach me?

89
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,475
Teach what?

90
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:11,356
Never seen anyone
wear a saree that way.

91
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,090
I also want to learn.

92
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:15,938
Of course, you will.

93
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:19,894
You and everyone
else in this house

94
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:21,909
every Bengali woman will.

95
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:26,348
'And on it said
a century of prayers'

96
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:30,546
'such as I can, twice o'er.
I'll weep and sigh.'

97
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:34,356
'Leaving so his service,
follow you.'

98
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,285
'So please, you entertain me.'

99
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:42,982
Wonder why Shakespeare named
this play 'Cymbeline'?

100
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:48,085
Should have called it 'Imogen'
you think? - Of course.

101
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,505
It's Imogen who marries
Posthumous

102
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:54,189
against her father's wishes.
She is the real heroine.

103
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:58,259
On the other hand, when
Posthumous goes into exile..

104
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,929
You see what Shakespeare
experts have said is..

105
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:06,178
You really love sister-in-law
a lot, don't you?

106
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:15,689
Yes, I do,
but I love you much more.

107
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,701
A hundred times more.

108
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,424
You are sad today, aren't you?

109
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,656
Why? How can you tell?

110
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,108
Because Madhusudan Dutta
is dead.

111
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:34,615
Yes, Kadambari.

112
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:37,922
You never saw him.

113
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,595
Such a genius!

114
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:44,017
How could he get greedy
and blow away all his money!

115
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,277
I feel so bad for his
wife Henrietta.

116
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:55,078
Actually,
can't you stand by her?

117
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,259
By her?

118
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,614
You're not afraid of
sending me

119
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,780
to such a beautiful
French widow?

120
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,894
What if I fall in love with her?

121
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,608
Then I will poison myself
to death.

122
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,914
Shush!

123
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:18,025
Why do you say that?
Never ever say that again.

124
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,215
Kadambari..

125
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:25,736
Or I will be really
angry with you.

126
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:29,922
So many times
I pleaded with father

127
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:32,652
not to get them married.

128
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,152
Jyoti has to groom himself now

129
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:39,772
go abroad,
have diverse exposures

130
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:42,849
enrich himself instead..

131
00:11:44,515 --> 00:11:48,022
Father's orders..
How could Jyoti go against that?

132
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:52,804
Besides, I have grave doubts
about this girl's lineage.

133
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,204
She is accountant
Shyam's daughter.

134
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:58,064
Moreover Shyam is not
from a very good background.

135
00:11:58,194 --> 00:11:59,977
Father knew all this.

136
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:04,106
Even if we are considered
an inferior caste of Brahmins

137
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:05,871
couldn't we find any other girl?

138
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,784
Have we not found more
suitable brides before?

139
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:12,981
Well, in that case,
if you think of me for instance.

140
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:15,230
At least, your family is
well-known.

141
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:19,689
Shyam, your daughter is now
our daughter-in-law.

142
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:23,138
I have served this
household for so long.

143
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:26,061
How's it possible
for me not to enter?

144
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:30,270
In our opinion,
that is not desirable.

145
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:34,296
After all,
Jyoti is your son-in-law

146
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,662
so, in your
son-in-law's presence..

147
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:40,138
So where do you think
I should live from now on?

148
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:42,204
If you please, give me a
little place in this house.

149
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:44,231
I have informed them.

150
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:46,802
They will take care
of your expenses.

151
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:49,831
Everything has been sorted.

152
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:57,626
'I could sense very well'

153
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:01,067
'that I would never be
a part of the family.'

154
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,718
'A daughter-in-law,
but still an outsider.'

155
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:07,539
'Amidst such heartaches'

156
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:10,113
'Robi's presence felt
like a breath of fresh air.'

157
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:12,407
You have not eaten anything
since you came back from school

158
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:15,522
Come on eat..
- No, I won't.

159
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:16,939
I said, come here.

160
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,683
Eat this..
- I told you, I won't.

161
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:20,231
I will be very angry.

162
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,939
You haven't eaten anything
since you came back from school.

163
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,932
Keep the food here.
I will make him eat.

164
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:26,284
Fine. As you say.

165
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,474
Here's our seasoned
housewife, eh?

166
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,694
Want to?

167
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:45,498
Not that way!

168
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,625
Impossible! I can't do this.

169
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:04,375
Where did you learn it?

170
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,051
What?
- All this?

171
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:11,694
Come on, can I be a
good housewife otherwise?

172
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:18,122
Cut betel nuts,
fruits, vegetables

173
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,586
if I don't know all this

174
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,929
will I be able to look
after your elder brother?

175
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,318
You don't want to read books?

176
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,231
Don't you wish
to go to school?

177
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,605
Do wishes matter? I have to
look after my family, right?

178
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:39,106
I will read to you.

179
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:43,101
My school books, all books,
everything.

180
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:46,907
'The cowboy takes
his herd to grass.'

181
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:50,242
'Children get busy
with daily tasks.'

182
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:53,939
'Malati flowers spring to bloom'

183
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:57,610
'drawn by their scent
honeybees roam.'

184
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,064
'The sun rises in the horizon'

185
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:01,935
'with a reddish haze.'

186
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:08,439
'It was Robi who
first showed me'

187
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:11,573
'how the darkness
slowly gives way'

188
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,314
'to the reddish
glow in the east.'

189
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:16,455
'My first sunrise.'

190
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:22,411
What are you writing?

191
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,486
Robi?

192
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,970
I will take your notebook away.
- What are you doing?

193
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:42,377
You sit mum all day,
I don't like it one bit.

194
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,289
I will cross it all out.

195
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,197
Want to hear what
I have written?

196
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,917
Read it. Then go
bathe and change.

197
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,904
We are going up to
the terrace after that.

198
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:54,926
Hear it, then.

199
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:58,564
'What song did the dawn bird'

200
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:00,272
'sing this morning?'

201
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:04,361
'From far off in the sky
down it came floating.'

202
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:06,265
How do you like it?

203
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,381
Not too good.

204
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:11,634
'Down it came floating'
is kind of..

205
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,564
You don't like it?

206
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:16,856
Well, I am not laboring on it.

207
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,777
It's pouring out
spontaneously.

208
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,527
As if spontaneity always
makes for good poetry.

209
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:28,899
'Who knows how it came in here?'

210
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,060
'Strain of a lost melody.'

211
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,249
'Moving through dark caverns.'

212
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,897
'Weeping, weeping mournfully.'

213
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,528
'Touching my heart.'

214
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:42,356
I don't find anything
new in this.

215
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:44,030
Perhaps I am wrong.

216
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,934
You aren't finding
anything new in this?

217
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:51,019
For instance,
not like Bihari babu's poems.

218
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:56,956
Robi, you are getting upset?
Read more.

219
00:16:57,954 --> 00:16:59,365
Let me hear more.

220
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,709
'How did the morning sun today'

221
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,237
'touch my heart in this way?'

222
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:13,175
'How in the darkness of the cave
echoed the dawn-bird's song.'

223
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:16,315
'I wonder why my heart leaps up,
awake after so long.'

224
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:20,856
I like this part.
Really like it, I do.

225
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,689
'Awakened is my heart'

226
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,606
'O wellsprings overspill.'

227
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:26,939
'O heart's desires,
passion's rise'

228
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,830
'which I cannot still.'

229
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,836
'The earth is all shiver.'

230
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,981
'Rocks in ruins crumbling.'

231
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,772
'In frothy waves
the ocean heaves.'

232
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:36,229
'With fierce rancor growling..'

233
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,921
Robi.. Robi, what's come over
you today?

234
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:43,810
Sister-in-law, I am in a daze.

235
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,022
I don't know why.

236
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:47,841
As if I am no longer
my own self.

237
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:55,413
'Literary sessions were
held in our terrace garden.'

238
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,211
Here she comes.
- Greetings to all.

239
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:58,064
Greetings.

240
00:17:58,194 --> 00:17:59,814
Kadambari hasn't heard
any in a long time.

241
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:01,619
Are you sure you
want to, sister?

242
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:05,064
I've written a bunch of poems
on the 'Monsoons'.

243
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:07,072
Rainy outpourings will
remain a bit lifeless

244
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,877
unless I read them to you.

245
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:14,631
Come along, sister.
Let's chat in private.

246
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,408
Wait a bit, sister,
Let's hear the poetry now.

247
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:19,606
We can have a chat later.

248
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:23,562
Why? Is my poetry so bad
that you want to leave?

249
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:26,404
You have many
admirers here.

250
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:28,463
You don't need me here.

251
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:30,272
Do sit down, sister-in-law.

252
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,322
Our party will be dull
without you.

253
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,272
You carry on.

254
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:36,227
I will go and arrange
some snacks.

255
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:38,189
Don't you worry, sister-in-law.

256
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,022
The snacks will be here soon.
It's all arranged.

257
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:42,314
It's here!
- See.

258
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:45,472
Behold plates full of fish
cutlets and mutton chops.

259
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:49,523
No, sir, no mutton chops today.
It's a different menu.

260
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,221
Oh no, sister Kadambari.

261
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:54,004
The first attraction
here is you yourself

262
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,402
and second the special mutton
chops you make. None today?

263
00:18:57,532 --> 00:19:00,939
'With a saree-end's flip
they drop drip, drip.'

264
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:03,106
'Feeble dewdrops on the rose.'

265
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:04,106
'Petals of the
fragrant 'Kamini'..'

266
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:07,412
'Akshoy Nokho Chaudhary
Biharilal Chakraborty'

267
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,646
'and many other talented men
sat there for hours'

268
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:14,382
'reciting, singing, chatting,
poetry debates.'

269
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:18,397
'They opened up
windows in my mind.'

270
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,101
'I loved them.'

271
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:31,031
'Never dreamed I would go riding
with my husband on the ground.'

272
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,527
'I will hold the
reins of the horse.'

273
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:39,033
'He had an open mind.'

274
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:41,106
'Not bigoted in the least.'

275
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:46,155
'He is the one who encouraged me
to learn horse-riding.'

276
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:50,104
'Not just my husband.'

277
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:52,402
'He was my true guardian.'

278
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:05,152
Did you bring the latest issue
of 'Banga Darshan', Malini?

279
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:06,675
Yes, indeed.

280
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:10,814
Bankim Babu's idea of this
magazine is so good.

281
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,106
We get to read
so many new writings.

282
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:15,027
I can't sleep unless
I read his 'Poison Tree'

283
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,685
serial every month.
- You're right.

284
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:21,065
I really like Kundonandini
in 'Poison Tree'.

285
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:24,243
The plight of that sad, lonely
girl keeps me awake all night.

286
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:26,888
Will no one ever
love her really?

287
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,446
The tussle between
Kundo and Surjomukhi

288
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:31,309
is what makes the
story so gripping.

289
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,469
I must say Bankim Babu
has real courage

290
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,145
to portray a widow's
love so openly.

291
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:38,986
Hope Bengalis can
stomach that much!

292
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:43,231
And what about you? The way
you've battled all odds yourself

293
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:45,019
is no small matter.

294
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,076
Women writers are
trivialized by the literati

295
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:53,402
but we know how you struggle
to make the impossible possible.

296
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,522
Come! Come!
- Look, Urmila's here.

297
00:20:57,652 --> 00:21:00,147
Holo's mom! Take Urmila away.
- My sweetheart.

298
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:02,814
How come she is here?
Sleeping, were you? - Baby.

299
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:04,856
Not my fault, madam.

300
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:08,487
I sat her down and
went out to take a leak

301
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,446
and she slipped off in no time.

302
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:13,141
I have told you
not to use such language.

303
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,689
Take her downstairs.

304
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:16,125
Leave. I will look after her.

305
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:19,260
This little sweetheart
won't bother us at all.

306
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,468
Please don't scold her.

307
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,647
You really spoil the children.

308
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:25,133
You and elder sis-in-law
are both to blame.

309
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,809
The way we were
brought up in this house

310
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:29,064
they will grow too
in the same atmosphere.

311
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:32,342
I don't have to waste my
precious time on them, please.

312
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,606
You bore such angelic offspring
with no effort at all

313
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:38,898
so you neglect them like this?

314
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:42,481
I don't have the strength to
throw Urmila out of the room

315
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,083
and discuss literature.

316
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:45,897
Isn't it, sweetheart?

317
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,856
"Come companions hand in hand."

318
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:07,189
"Let us dance and sing."

319
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,654
"Come companions hand in hand."

320
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:15,814
"Let us dance and sing."

321
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:20,106
"Bring along your 'veena'."

322
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:24,647
"Bring along your 'veena'."

323
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:29,230
"Tuned to the highest string."

324
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,938
"Come companions hand in hand."

325
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:38,314
"Let us dance and sing."

326
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:41,963
My song has never been
put to such good use before.

327
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,612
Where's that book of old verse?

328
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,040
I am enjoying Vaishnava
poetry so much.

329
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:56,980
It gives a different
kind of feeling.

330
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:58,890
The rhythm is different.

331
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,400
Now you can't say I waste
my time on cheap novels.

332
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,078
There is a ship being auctioned.

333
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,864
I think I will bid for it.

334
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:13,069
Ship?
- Yes.

335
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:15,106
Jyoti! Jyoti!

336
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:16,481
Ah, there you are,
sister-in-law.

337
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:17,930
I wish to start a
shipping company.

338
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,166
How's the idea?

339
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:20,897
Suddenly?

340
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:22,481
Why suddenly?

341
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,189
Ships are part of
our family history.

342
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,303
Our grandfather was
a shipping magnate.

343
00:23:29,646 --> 00:23:33,498
So launch a shipping company,
run a magazine

344
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:36,088
work for the theatre.

345
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:38,396
What else will you do?
- Why?

346
00:23:40,597 --> 00:23:44,197
And here your wife is all
dressed up for you.

347
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:46,487
Any concern for her?

348
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:26,364
Why did you stop? Play on.

349
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:28,409
Did I disturb your writing?

350
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,700
You got up.

351
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,289
No, no. I wasn't disturbed.

352
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:34,393
I was playing softly. Thought
it wouldn't reach so far.

353
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:38,046
I came just because
I liked the sound.

354
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,450
What tune is that?
Play some more.

355
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,284
It is nothing special.

356
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,484
Why did you drop your
work and come?

357
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:46,647
I couldn't concentrate.

358
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:50,609
I heard a chorus of
birds suddenly.

359
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:53,673
I thought it was daybreak.

360
00:24:55,028 --> 00:24:56,866
Some days mornings and evenings

361
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,652
confuse me so,
I can't tell them apart.

362
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,367
The birds leave their
nests in the morning

363
00:25:03,497 --> 00:25:05,693
in the evening they
come home again.

364
00:25:07,164 --> 00:25:09,034
Bidding farewell to the day.

365
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,505
I only hear their farewell song.

366
00:25:13,997 --> 00:25:15,710
I have been writing
all day long.

367
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:18,284
At one point my
fingers rebelled.

368
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:22,471
My mind said, 'Let's go
chat with sister-in-law.'

369
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:25,075
Then I heard you on the piano

370
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:29,367
and crept in to see you
so engrossed in your melody.

371
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,697
What shall we talk about?

372
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:33,676
About your early life.

373
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:35,683
My early life?

374
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:37,494
You mean my parents' home?

375
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:42,222
There is nothing to talk about.
No one here likes my family.

376
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:44,603
I have not been there
in years.. - No, no, no.

377
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:47,230
It's not about your
parents' house, Hecate.

378
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,365
Talk about your previous life.

379
00:25:49,495 --> 00:25:52,572
When you were a Greek goddess?

380
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:55,742
Was I that?
- Don't you remember?

381
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:58,575
You had three faces then.

382
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:00,825
One beautiful face can
conquer the world.

383
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:02,867
You had three such faces.

384
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:07,225
How horrible she must
have looked! Three-faced woman.

385
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:08,544
No, no.

386
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:13,073
Heaven, earth and ocean.
She had eyes on them all.

387
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,378
She was bewitching.

388
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,143
When Persephone was kidnapped
and taken to Hades

389
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:22,383
it was Hecate who followed her
with a flaming torch.

390
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:25,046
Where were you then?

391
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:27,462
I was in Greece perhaps.

392
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:29,946
A nameless devotee
of that goddess.

393
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,819
Go away. Why do you
talk such gibberish?

394
00:26:34,022 --> 00:26:36,140
Why are you all
dressed up today?

395
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,556
Is brother Jyoti taking
you out somewhere?

396
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:41,259
Your brother hardly has
any time for me

397
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:43,303
leaving his theatre
and business.

398
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:46,124
I won't go anywhere.

399
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:49,073
Why? Can't I dress up
just for myself?

400
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:52,399
Come, let's go up
to the terrace.

401
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:54,911
Dusk will settle soon.

402
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:56,784
When the horizon melts away

403
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:58,333
you can walk on the terrace

404
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,552
and feel as if you are
going far, far away

405
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:03,209
Will you come?
- Let's go.

406
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:21,575
"A new day dawns today."

407
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:26,669
"It's new colors gay."

408
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:32,222
"Makes my heart leap
with tenderness deep."

409
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:37,115
"Makes my heart leap
with tenderness deep."

410
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:41,167
"To love in a wondrous way."

411
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:45,867
"A new day dawns today."

412
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:51,176
"It's new colors gay."

413
00:28:10,345 --> 00:28:14,992
"Who makes my heart swing?"

414
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:20,342
"Who makes my heart swing?"

415
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,836
"What new music rings.."

416
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:30,656
"What new music rings.."

417
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:34,873
"Through the live long day."

418
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:39,750
"Who makes my heart swing?"

419
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:45,075
"In the middle
of a rainy night."

420
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:49,956
"I fly to the door
in delight."

421
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:54,762
"In the middle of
a rainy night."

422
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:59,747
"I fly to the door in delight."

423
00:28:59,877 --> 00:29:04,539
"Arms outstretched to
hold you tight."

424
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:08,617
"Calling again and again."

425
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:13,503
"A new day dawns today."

426
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:18,349
"It's new colors gay."

427
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,576
Has Urmila come here?

428
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:32,677
We were just talking
about you, sister.

429
00:29:33,657 --> 00:29:36,717
Just playing with Urmila
all day, is that all you can do?

430
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,122
You don't come downstairs
at all these days.

431
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:41,195
While we work ourselves to death

432
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:43,117
our sarees soiled
with oil and turmeric.

433
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:47,732
You dress up in the morning
and discuss literature

434
00:29:47,862 --> 00:29:49,303
or play with dolls.

435
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:50,986
We have to hear
such snide remarks

436
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:52,699
about your behavior as it is.

437
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:55,026
What have I done to invite
snide remarks?

438
00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:58,858
If you are part of a household,
you have to follow some rules

439
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:00,552
or else tongues will wag.

440
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,504
What rule have I broken?

441
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:09,513
Now listen, sister,
you avoid the rest of us

442
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,810
mix with outsiders every day.

443
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,789
Just outsiders?

444
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,021
People frown on such things.

445
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,881
I have broken rules too

446
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:28,379
come out of purdah
mixed with many men.

447
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:32,031
But I live compatibly with the
women folk of the household.

448
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:35,892
I don't mix with them
is not true, sister.

449
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:39,180
They are the ones who
stay aloof from me.

450
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,492
I don't know why.

451
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:45,145
Sister-in-law, you must offer
prayers to Goddess Shasthi.

452
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:47,568
No babies even at this ripe age

453
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:49,409
no wonder your mind
wanders around.

454
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:51,988
They all call you barren,
don't you feel bad?

455
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:55,743
Oh, why are all of you
going after her like this?

456
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:02,595
Sister, Urmila is
yours from today.

457
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:05,122
You bring her up.

458
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:16,121
I hear all kinds of gossip.

459
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:19,700
It's best you distance
yourself from it.

460
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:23,263
Go to England,
become a barrister.

461
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:25,619
You will find
a definite direction.

462
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:29,067
Treat it as a good opportunity.

463
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,052
Actually the thing is

464
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:34,955
devoting your heart and soul

465
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:38,940
to that endeavor
is a challenge in itself.

466
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:43,910
Don't come back half way
through like last time.

467
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:48,631
Oh yes. Satyaprasad
will accompany you.

468
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,421
See if he can..

469
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:17,646
Sister-in-law.

470
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:21,212
I have to leave now.

471
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:27,247
The crispies are there.
Don't forget them.

472
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,992
Sister-in-law, I..
- Let it be.

473
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:42,660
I will be fine.

474
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,450
Your brother and I are going
to Chandernagore tomorrow

475
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,126
for a couple of weeks.

476
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,080
Robi?

477
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:53,817
Will you promise me something?

478
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:55,159
Of course.

479
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:56,497
Please tell me.

480
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,690
Promise me,
you will write to me every day.

481
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,936
I will..

482
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:02,116
Don't you worry about me.

483
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,450
You will study there..

484
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,456
Make new friends there.

485
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:11,669
So many pretty English ladies..
- Stop it.

486
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:03,705
Robi will leave
from Madras today.

487
00:34:03,872 --> 00:34:06,032
No news from Kolkata yet.

488
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:11,343
At least, Satya will
be with him. That's a relief.

489
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:14,623
He will have company
on that long voyage.

490
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:15,664
Isn't it?

491
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:18,554
Sister-in-law!

492
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:22,090
Whose voice is that?

493
00:34:23,622 --> 00:34:25,129
Who?
- Sister-in-law!

494
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:26,312
Robi!

495
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,909
Brother Jyoti! Sister-in-law!

496
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,055
Robi!

497
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,575
Your illustrious nephew

498
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:42,200
so full of plans from the minute
we sailed from Kolkata.

499
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,505
Once he is back as a barrister

500
00:34:44,635 --> 00:34:46,391
he would leave
the Jorasanko house.

501
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,465
He'll rent a place
in posh neighborhood

502
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:52,409
with me as his junior.
- Good.

503
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:54,367
I won't have to work too hard.

504
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:56,742
I can write poetry all I want.

505
00:34:56,872 --> 00:35:01,165
Even before we reached Madras
he got a stomach ache

506
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:05,909
and started screaming.
'Robi, I am going home.'

507
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,961
I kept saying,
'It's just sea-sickness.'

508
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:09,118
'You will be fine in
a couple of days.'

509
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:12,206
But his howling increased
says he has blood dysentery

510
00:35:12,336 --> 00:35:14,333
he would die soon.

511
00:35:15,194 --> 00:35:19,628
The captain wished he could
hurl him off the ship midway.

512
00:35:21,682 --> 00:35:22,956
So then?

513
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,018
And then..
so back we came from Madras.

514
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:29,200
If such a short trip put
him in such a state.

515
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,284
I wonder about
the long voyage.

516
00:35:31,414 --> 00:35:33,909
As soon as we got off
he says, 'Listen Robi'

517
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,850
'Grandfather will kill me
if I go back alone.'

518
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,309
'Come to Kolkata with me.'

519
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:40,453
'You can go abroad
some other time.'

520
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,143
Well done, brother.

521
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,214
Robi, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

522
00:35:57,344 --> 00:36:00,120
Last evening
a man came with a letter.

523
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:01,741
Two messengers from

524
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:03,742
the King of Tripura
wish to meet you.

525
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,329
Why?
- How would I know?

526
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:11,110
I hear that the kings of Tripura
capture tutors from Kolkata.

527
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,534
Maybe they think
you are the one.

528
00:36:13,664 --> 00:36:15,034
Robi, a tutor?

529
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:16,992
Oh, yes I remember.

530
00:36:17,122 --> 00:36:19,117
The present king of Tripura..
What's his name?

531
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:21,825
Birchand.. No, Bhiruchand.
Birmanikya.

532
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,416
Is it for me?

533
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:26,825
No, mister.
It is for dear Urmila.

534
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:28,659
Birmanikya, understand?

535
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:32,075
He wants a set of
Nine Jewels in his court.

536
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:34,700
He has taken our singer
Jodu Bhatto there.

537
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,283
Maybe he wants you
as his Court Poet?

538
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:39,177
If so, your future is made.

539
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,446
Brother Jyoti,
I don't wish to meet them.

540
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:44,034
Why?

541
00:36:44,164 --> 00:36:49,463
Go to Tripura as their
Court Poet, such an honor.

542
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:51,742
We can holiday there too.

543
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:55,043
At least, hear them out.
I have asked them to come.

544
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:59,992
Kings of native states can
have such weird desires.

545
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,075
Lots of interesting stories.

546
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:04,367
Some spend thousands
on a dog's wedding

547
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:06,534
some have 500 wives.

548
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:08,815
Sultan Ghiyasuddin of Mandu had

549
00:37:08,945 --> 00:37:10,639
15,000 women in his
harem they say.

550
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:14,744
His bodyguards were all women,
they surrounded his throne.

551
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:17,742
The fellow would not set
eyes on any man.

552
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:19,742
They don't have any
defense budget.

553
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:23,450
No soldiers needed,
so they squander their wealth.

554
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,222
See what craze this
Birmanikya of Tripura has!

555
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,870
Strangers coming.
I better go inside.

556
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,133
Why?

557
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,528
Two messengers of the king
of Tripura are coming.

558
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,990
If our elder sister-in-law could
go meet the Governor-General

559
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:42,825
why can't you appear in front
of some king's messengers?

560
00:37:42,955 --> 00:37:46,012
Can I do everything
your elder sister-in-law can?

561
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:49,622
Give it to me.

562
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:22,224
Somebody has sent a gift..

563
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,797
Robi, take it.

564
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,830
It's our honor.

565
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:42,171
Sister-in-law!

566
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,551
Sister-in-law!

567
00:38:50,352 --> 00:38:51,680
The Maharaja of Tripura

568
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,366
is very impressed by
my book 'Broken-heart'.

569
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,450
They had plenty of
good things to say.

570
00:38:57,529 --> 00:38:58,839
Aren't you pleased?

571
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,120
Why should I not be?

572
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:04,867
We are all pleased when you
attain more honors.

573
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:07,492
That book is written for you.
The honor is yours too.

574
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:08,925
I don't want it.

575
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:14,816
They gave so many gifts.
Don't you want to see?

576
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:17,973
I will. Maybe later.

577
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:22,450
What's the matter with you?
Feeling sad?

578
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,928
No. nothing.

579
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,902
Why did you ask me
to go to Tripura?

580
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,534
You will go anyway
on your own.

581
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,934
Tripura or someplace else.

582
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:43,913
The more famous you become

583
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:48,156
the more you will belong
to people at large

584
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:52,293
quite natural.

585
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:57,577
Why should I hold you
back in a small space?

586
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,474
I won't go anywhere leaving you.

587
00:40:01,886 --> 00:40:03,255
Know that for sure.

588
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:06,129
No, Robi, that can't be.

589
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:11,950
You won't find time to read
your poems out to me first.

590
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,823
All the poems in
'Broken-heart' are for you.

591
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:24,413
The letters published
in Bharati

592
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:28,046
are all written to you.

593
00:40:45,938 --> 00:40:48,137
Let's go inside.
It's very windy.

594
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:50,192
I think a storm is coming.

595
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,545
'In the monsoon months
brimming with rains.'

596
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,659
'An empty shrine my mind is.'

597
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:08,100
Vidyapati?

598
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:11,618
Do you remember the tune?

599
00:41:12,515 --> 00:41:14,063
Can you sing it for me?

600
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:26,409
"In the monsoon months
brimming with rains."

601
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:33,075
"An empty shrine my mind is."

602
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:38,570
"In the monsoon months."

603
00:42:10,426 --> 00:42:17,169
"In the monsoon months
brimming with rains."

604
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:23,847
"An empty shrine my mind is."

605
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:30,700
"In the monsoon months
brimming with rains."

606
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:37,424
"An empty shrine my mind is."

607
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:41,560
"In the monsoon months.."

608
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:21,560
"As the clouds furiously growl"

609
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:28,256
"and the skies open up."

610
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:35,117
"Pining for my far-away beloved"

611
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:41,580
"stings my heart no end."

612
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:48,575
"Thrilled by the thunderclaps"

613
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:55,393
"the peacocks dance like crazy."

614
00:43:55,523 --> 00:44:08,904
"The peacocks dance like crazy."

615
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:15,784
"Frantic frogs join
the waterfowls"

616
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:22,209
"in singing their hearts out."

617
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:29,305
"In the monsoon months
brimming with rains."

618
00:44:29,435 --> 00:44:36,038
"An empty shrine my mind is."

619
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:41,201
"In the monsoon months.."

620
00:44:48,101 --> 00:44:49,446
Hey! What are you doing?

621
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:52,456
Come this side. No. no.

622
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,895
That's it. That's it.

623
00:44:56,025 --> 00:44:57,202
Keep it there.

624
00:44:58,552 --> 00:44:59,861
Robi, come on..

625
00:45:00,345 --> 00:45:03,054
I am thinking of spending
the night on the river.

626
00:45:03,184 --> 00:45:04,935
We will never see
such a beauteous sky.

627
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,501
What's going on?
- Is everything done?

628
00:45:10,631 --> 00:45:12,448
You are lost upstairs
all afternoon.

629
00:45:12,578 --> 00:45:14,127
I'll leave in some time.

630
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:15,985
How many poems did you write?

631
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,818
I wrote some, not a lot.

632
00:45:21,105 --> 00:45:23,403
Those unwritten lines
may be real poetry.

633
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:26,823
I can't quite get
a hold on them.

634
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:28,887
Why?

635
00:45:29,704 --> 00:45:31,774
Someone's standing in my way.

636
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:33,470
Who?

637
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:06,199
"I have made thee
my life's guiding star."

638
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:14,048
"No more in this ocean
will I stray far."

639
00:46:14,178 --> 00:46:22,159
"I have made thee
my life's guiding star."

640
00:46:53,414 --> 00:46:54,552
Bravo!

641
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:57,986
How far have we come?
- Near Palta.

642
00:46:58,116 --> 00:46:59,723
It's time to return.
- Okay.

643
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:02,012
Why so soon?

644
00:47:03,313 --> 00:47:05,215
You were playing
an evening raga.

645
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:07,498
I thought we'd take it on
to Bhairavi at dawn.

646
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:13,465
"What is meant by
thought, mate?"

647
00:47:13,595 --> 00:47:17,697
"What is meant by pain?"

648
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:22,547
"You keep talking
day and night."

649
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:25,964
"Of love, love and love.."

650
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:30,137
"Dear, what is this love then?"

651
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:34,233
"Is it merely filled with pain?"

652
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:40,650
"Is it only tears?"

653
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,235
Robi!
- Yes.

654
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:44,965
I think we are
somewhere near Palta.

655
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,715
Let's dive in shall we?

656
00:47:47,054 --> 00:47:49,055
We will swim to brother Guno's
place to meet him.

657
00:47:49,185 --> 00:47:50,839
No, no, you can't go

658
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,406
Now? Not now.

659
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:08,368
'Why are you wandering
all alone in your mind?'

660
00:48:09,577 --> 00:48:13,003
All togged up
so brightly I see.

661
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:15,797
And how come
you are up so early?

662
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:19,173
How can one sleep
with so many birds calling?

663
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:21,715
I woke up and
stood at the window

664
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:24,735
and the scent of
flowers overwhelmed me.

665
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:26,341
Look at all the flowers
I have plucked.

666
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,798
Sister-in-law, we will spend
all day in the garden tomorrow.

667
00:48:30,928 --> 00:48:33,426
Nothing else, just chat and sing
that's all.

668
00:48:34,507 --> 00:48:36,632
You have important
writing to do today?

669
00:48:36,762 --> 00:48:38,048
Not writing.

670
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:40,095
I have to go to Kolkata today.

671
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:41,780
I have promised.

672
00:48:43,678 --> 00:48:45,132
Promised whom?

673
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:47,088
That you can't break it
come what may?

674
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:49,827
Elder sister-in-law.

675
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,548
It's Suren's birthday.

676
00:48:52,678 --> 00:48:56,971
Also I haven't been to their
Birijitola home till date.

677
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:01,959
Then who can dare
keep you back?

678
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:05,132
I have to catch
the 8:30 steamer.

679
00:49:05,262 --> 00:49:06,670
May I go?
- Sure.

680
00:49:11,053 --> 00:49:13,417
You won't stay
back in Kolkata I hope?

681
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,607
Promise me you will
be back tonight?

682
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:18,565
I promise, sister-in-law.

683
00:49:29,387 --> 00:49:30,303
Elder sister-in-law.

684
00:49:30,755 --> 00:49:31,856
Elder sister-in-law.

685
00:49:31,986 --> 00:49:32,769
Robi?

686
00:49:34,228 --> 00:49:36,272
Remembered us finally?

687
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:39,377
Hiding out at Chandernagore,
were you?

688
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:41,382
Elder sister-in-law,
I am hungry.

689
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:42,785
What can you offer me?

690
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:47,328
Why this disheveled look?

691
00:49:47,841 --> 00:49:50,543
Shoes all muddy.
Take them off right away.

692
00:49:50,673 --> 00:49:53,187
I gave a singing lesson all
afternoon. I am starving.

693
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:55,541
Uncle Robi..
- Here you are.. Come on!

694
00:49:55,671 --> 00:49:58,423
Why were you away so long?

695
00:49:58,553 --> 00:50:00,590
I couldn't get time.
- Tell us why didn't you come?

696
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,747
I thought you forgot
Suri's birthday.

697
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,632
Come on now, change quickly.

698
00:50:07,762 --> 00:50:09,591
We're expecting lots of guests.
- Sure..

699
00:50:09,887 --> 00:50:12,298
Uncle, you are
staying here tonight.

700
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:13,382
You can't leave today.

701
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:15,257
We will cut a big cake.
- Is it so?

702
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,923
Promise you will stay?
- Okay, okay.

703
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:20,965
Now you go inside,
I am coming.

704
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:22,345
Okay.

705
00:50:24,906 --> 00:50:28,258
Why stay in Chandernagore
for so long, Robi?

706
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:31,339
Stay with us.

707
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:34,612
So many empty rooms here.

708
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:37,888
Bibi and Suri love you so much.

709
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:40,556
They keep talking about you.

710
00:50:43,178 --> 00:50:44,539
Jyoti is coming too.

711
00:50:45,373 --> 00:50:47,407
He said he would
spend the night here.

712
00:50:47,828 --> 00:50:49,340
I told him too.

713
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,034
Enough of Chandernagore,
come back to Kolkata now.

714
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,963
Garden houses are
for short stays only.

715
00:50:57,446 --> 00:51:01,001
How can city-bred people
live there for too long?

716
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,850
Look, he is here.. Hi.

717
00:51:07,528 --> 00:51:09,807
What are you doing here?

718
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:12,666
I have to take
keen interest in..

719
00:51:12,941 --> 00:51:16,047
contemporary of..
- You're all grown up!

720
00:51:16,177 --> 00:51:19,537
...specially romantic..
- Is it?

721
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,548
Isn't Jyoti coming?

722
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,512
He is supposed to be
here by now.

723
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:25,133
There he is.

724
00:51:26,636 --> 00:51:27,715
Hello!
- Hello!

725
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:29,805
How are you?
- I am fine. Thank you!

726
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:35,673
Jyoti, why so late?

727
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:37,340
So sorry sister-in-law.

728
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,215
I was coaching the
theatre artistes.

729
00:51:39,345 --> 00:51:43,183
Such fools, they can't speak
Bengali with the right accent.

730
00:51:45,095 --> 00:51:46,618
Tell me the truth.

731
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,796
Which actress held you
back for so long?

732
00:51:50,034 --> 00:51:53,923
"I will love her secretly."

733
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:55,931
"Not a soul will come to know."

734
00:51:56,061 --> 00:52:00,480
"For he is a jolly good fellow"

735
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:04,078
"For he is a jolly good fellow"

736
00:52:04,428 --> 00:52:06,720
"so say all of us."

737
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,215
"For he is a jolly
good fellow.."

738
00:52:09,345 --> 00:52:12,896
The English legal system
is not exactly like ours.

739
00:52:13,026 --> 00:52:15,617
Everything is very
organized there.

740
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:17,568
At least my experience says so.

741
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:20,690
"Happy birthday to you."

742
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:25,423
"Happy birthday to you."

743
00:52:25,553 --> 00:52:30,369
"Happy birthday dear Suren."

744
00:52:30,653 --> 00:52:35,195
"Happy birthday to you!"

745
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:43,312
"May God bless you."

746
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,838
Are you not going back to
Chandernagore tonight?

747
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:49,064
Sister-in-law is there alone.

748
00:52:50,136 --> 00:52:52,572
There's plenty of
servants and guards.

749
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,781
What if she does spend
one night alone?

750
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,105
You better go back.

751
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:07,353
Tell her I have some work
to do tomorrow morning

752
00:53:08,617 --> 00:53:10,256
so I can't get back tonight.

753
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:13,536
Will you really go back tonight?

754
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:17,148
How will you go, Robi?

755
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:19,860
Take a boat all the way?

756
00:53:20,553 --> 00:53:24,027
I have to go back, elder
sister-in-law no matter how.

757
00:53:48,563 --> 00:53:49,792
Sister-in-law?

758
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:53,970
Robi!

759
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:58,384
What have you done to yourself?

760
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:00,674
It's your birthday today.

761
00:54:01,315 --> 00:54:02,561
I didn't forget.

762
00:54:28,938 --> 00:54:32,553
'We had to give up Mr. Moran's
house in Chandernagore.'

763
00:54:33,032 --> 00:54:35,799
'I would have liked
the three of us'

764
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:38,903
'to while away our
time in poetry and song.'

765
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:40,629
'He's a busy man.'

766
00:54:41,202 --> 00:54:43,486
'He had to go to Kolkata
for all kinds of work.'

767
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:46,319
'Going back and forth
is such a waste of time.'

768
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:51,799
'To tell you the truth, I
too was missing little Urmila.'

769
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,833
Madam!
- Roopa! I just came.

770
00:54:57,963 --> 00:54:59,611
Where's Urmila?
- Right in your room.

771
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:02,456
You left and she was
in such a huff.. - Really?

772
00:55:02,586 --> 00:55:04,108
The little dear.
- My.. my.

773
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:05,984
See you then. Urmila?

774
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:08,551
Come dear, my darling.

775
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,400
Come here,
I'll swing you around.

776
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,277
She is here now.

777
00:55:12,407 --> 00:55:13,607
You won't come to me?

778
00:55:13,737 --> 00:55:16,531
Did I leave you?
- Come here.

779
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:18,413
Are you angry on me?

780
00:55:18,543 --> 00:55:19,682
Don't be upset.

781
00:55:19,812 --> 00:55:22,869
I'll never go away again
from you. Never.. never.

782
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:25,570
Let's go and play.

783
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,367
The flowers have wilted.

784
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:38,360
I warned you.

785
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,290
You were away

786
00:55:43,746 --> 00:55:45,936
who else would care for them?

787
00:56:11,404 --> 00:56:12,694
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

788
00:56:12,824 --> 00:56:15,111
Urmila fell down. Come fast.

789
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:17,185
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!
She is not breathing.

790
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:18,220
Kadambari!

791
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,103
She is not responding.
Oh my God!

792
00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:24,508
I need water. Please get some.

793
00:56:39,574 --> 00:56:40,866
Madam!

794
00:56:41,275 --> 00:56:42,686
Urmila is no more.

795
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:44,949
What?

796
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:46,377
Urmi..

797
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,444
We pay the servants
so much money

798
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:33,402
they look after
the children well.

799
00:57:33,532 --> 00:57:34,527
If you can't keep
an eye on them

800
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:36,967
what was the need for so
much of show off?

801
00:57:37,097 --> 00:57:40,047
Fell asleep with the child
so close to an open staircase

802
00:57:40,177 --> 00:57:42,111
you couldn't call
one of the maids?

803
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:43,501
If it were her own child

804
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:44,902
could she have fallen
asleep like that?

805
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:47,319
Can an aunt's love be
greater than a mother's?

806
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:48,402
Is it possible?

807
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:49,861
Are you human beings or what?

808
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:52,386
She is already
devastated by grief

809
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:55,353
and you are picking on her!
What a shame!

810
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:57,809
Let's go.

811
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:26,632
Young master and our madam
lived together in Chandernagore.

812
00:58:26,762 --> 00:58:29,444
But Mr. Jyoti was there, too.
- Oh come on.

813
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:32,170
I hear Mr. Jyoti spent
most of his time in Kolkata.

814
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,237
That's true.

815
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:35,888
How will he feel good
if he stays here?

816
00:58:45,716 --> 00:58:46,991
Read it.

817
00:58:49,106 --> 00:58:50,187
What is this?

818
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:54,254
Robi's writing.
Published in Bharati.

819
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:03,681
'I remember the window side.'

820
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:06,863
'I remember the trees
in the garden'

821
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:12,589
'and the feelings
in my tear-soaked heart.'

822
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:17,888
'And the one who stood
beside me, I remember her.'

823
00:59:19,317 --> 00:59:23,249
'She scribbled all over my
pages of poetry.'

824
00:59:25,391 --> 00:59:28,040
'Seeing that brings
tears to my eyes.'

825
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:31,670
'She wrote real poetry.'

826
00:59:35,483 --> 00:59:37,429
How could Robi
publish all these?

827
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:39,948
What a shame!

828
00:59:40,532 --> 00:59:43,383
Your brother is ruining
the good family name.

829
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:49,441
Did Jyoti know anything?

830
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:55,486
He is busy with his
plays and meetings.

831
00:59:55,616 --> 00:59:57,030
That's natural.

832
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,833
But taking advantage
of that..

833
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,573
I said right at the start

834
01:00:05,095 --> 01:00:07,894
they didn't look into her
family background.

835
01:00:10,669 --> 01:00:12,277
Now all the
servants in Jorasanko

836
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:14,715
are gossiping about what's
going on in Chandernagore.

837
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:16,449
What a shame!

838
01:00:17,866 --> 01:00:20,694
I asked Robi to stay back here

839
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:23,237
but because Kadambari
instigated..

840
01:00:26,366 --> 01:00:28,843
Father must know
of this at once.

841
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:32,402
There in Mussoorie?

842
01:00:32,532 --> 01:00:35,707
He should know
before all is lost.

843
01:00:35,837 --> 01:00:39,325
He has renounced family life
and he's immersed in meditation.

844
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,611
Why bother him?
- Nevertheless..

845
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,805
He's still the head of
the family.

846
01:00:46,408 --> 01:00:48,011
Robi must get married.

847
01:00:49,888 --> 01:00:53,069
Marriage?
Is he willing?

848
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:54,936
That's not important.

849
01:00:56,273 --> 01:00:58,774
If father says so,
Robi can't refuse.

850
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,310
Look what have you done to
yourself within a few days?

851
01:01:03,317 --> 01:01:05,544
Have you looked at
yourself in the mirror?

852
01:01:10,936 --> 01:01:12,603
How long will this continue?

853
01:01:13,794 --> 01:01:17,101
Life will have its
share of grief, pain too.

854
01:01:17,596 --> 01:01:20,074
But, that doesn't mean..
- What doesn't mean?

855
01:01:25,283 --> 01:01:27,161
One has to look forward.

856
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:31,395
You haven't read a single book
these few days.

857
01:01:33,058 --> 01:01:35,522
Shall I bring a few new books
for you? Will you read?

858
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:42,411
I may get temporary relief
by going through these books.

859
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:45,235
But when I get
to see Urmila's face

860
01:01:45,365 --> 01:01:47,196
in my mind again and again..

861
01:01:50,629 --> 01:01:54,982
Will you help me forget
everything

862
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:57,259
and look forward, Robi?

863
01:01:58,477 --> 01:02:00,630
You can't forget
everything, sister-in-law.

864
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:05,027
Still you have to control
your mind, and console it.

865
01:02:05,157 --> 01:02:07,690
Teach it how to look forward.
- Robi?

866
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:13,324
We've promised to meet
Beni Roy's daughter.

867
01:02:13,454 --> 01:02:15,784
Your brother and I have
already chosen her for you.

868
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:17,991
We like her.

869
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:26,234
Her Kundonandini in
'The Poison Tree'

870
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:27,672
Britannia in
'Battle of Plassey'

871
01:02:27,802 --> 01:02:30,902
and 'Meghnad's Slaying'.
Her seven roles together

872
01:02:31,032 --> 01:02:32,902
have caused such a stir.

873
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:35,548
Her exquisite singing voice,
her looks

874
01:02:35,678 --> 01:02:40,132
her acting skills dazzle
the stage night after night.

875
01:02:40,865 --> 01:02:43,774
The city's elite
fall at her feet.

876
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:47,024
I hear

877
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:51,861
after your husband directed
Binodini in 'Sarojini'..

878
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:53,949
Hey, why are you staring?

879
01:02:54,534 --> 01:02:56,236
I am looking at you.

880
01:02:56,366 --> 01:03:00,386
I wonder why your husband
still stays away from home?

881
01:03:01,116 --> 01:03:02,527
Didn't you hear?

882
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:04,970
He has no time to look at me.

883
01:03:06,126 --> 01:03:08,602
But you exaggerate a lot too.

884
01:03:08,957 --> 01:03:10,849
If I am really that beautiful

885
01:03:10,979 --> 01:03:12,416
why do I have to rot
in the house all alone?

886
01:03:12,546 --> 01:03:15,194
Well, if your husband jumps
into the fire like a moth

887
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,912
that doesn't mean your delicate
beauty is nothing at all.

888
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:21,018
Then why does he
leave me to go there?

889
01:03:22,157 --> 01:03:24,002
Are all his actresses
better than me

890
01:03:24,132 --> 01:03:26,777
in terms of culture
and education?

891
01:03:26,907 --> 01:03:28,765
Do they read
Biharibabu's poetry?

892
01:03:30,193 --> 01:03:32,832
Malini, let's go to
the theatre someday.

893
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,525
I heard that Binodini
is starring

894
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,296
in a new play by Girish Ghosh.

895
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:39,749
Lord of my life,
where art thou?

896
01:03:40,995 --> 01:03:44,907
In this forest deep
my heart quivers on.

897
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:49,902
Reveal thyself,
Lord of my life.

898
01:03:50,032 --> 01:03:52,696
Leave, oh leave this mockery.

899
01:03:53,658 --> 01:03:55,720
For I sicken with worry.

900
01:03:56,636 --> 01:03:59,657
How much more can
a woman bear?

901
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:01,819
She dies thy underling.

902
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:03,657
O jewel of my heart.

903
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:07,625
Observe, abandon me not.

904
01:04:08,459 --> 01:04:10,824
Tell me, feathered friend

905
01:04:11,116 --> 01:04:13,255
did My Lord pass this way?

906
01:04:13,814 --> 01:04:16,040
Tell me, which way did he go?

907
01:04:16,949 --> 01:04:19,336
Speak up, dear vine

908
01:04:20,116 --> 01:04:23,181
this mendicant
must her man find.

909
01:04:23,857 --> 01:04:26,907
Look ye mountains high.

910
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:29,434
Where doth My Lord lie

911
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,986
spouseless, my pipes
tell no tales.

912
01:04:34,202 --> 01:04:36,218
Hey, why are you crying?

913
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,198
Silent those sad ankle bells.

914
01:04:39,328 --> 01:04:43,431
Alas, whither shall I go?

915
01:04:44,613 --> 01:04:47,340
Follow My Lord where to?

916
01:04:49,157 --> 01:04:52,824
What trickery led
My Lord to spurn me?

917
01:04:53,638 --> 01:04:56,856
Prostrate at thy feet.

918
01:04:57,886 --> 01:05:00,004
Lay thy slave so meek.

919
01:05:01,241 --> 01:05:04,263
How Master could ye forget me?

920
01:05:06,517 --> 01:05:09,457
O Husband, I see thee now.

921
01:05:09,933 --> 01:05:12,944
Flee not again anyhow.

922
01:05:14,304 --> 01:05:18,161
Come see, me thinks I die.

923
01:05:26,391 --> 01:05:28,306
Let's go, Roopa.

924
01:05:29,729 --> 01:05:31,715
Brilliant!
- Amazing!

925
01:05:36,747 --> 01:05:39,429
Wow!

926
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:06,069
"Why does she want love?"

927
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:13,477
"Oh my God..
Take my heart away."

928
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:16,214
Are you having
an affair with Binodini?

929
01:06:21,082 --> 01:06:22,319
Are you?

930
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,942
Sometimes a dramatist's
inspiration is his heroine.

931
01:06:36,573 --> 01:06:38,002
Don't you know that?

932
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,923
Calling it an affair
sounds too crude.

933
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:54,298
Please don't stoop so low.
I beg you.

934
01:07:11,324 --> 01:07:12,623
Sister-in-law.

935
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:14,715
Robi.

936
01:07:16,134 --> 01:07:17,398
Come here..

937
01:07:18,103 --> 01:07:20,098
Hasn't your fever subsided yet?

938
01:07:34,089 --> 01:07:35,758
Sister-in-law, may I ask
you something?

939
01:07:35,888 --> 01:07:37,432
Will you tell me the truth?

940
01:07:38,017 --> 01:07:39,094
Yes.

941
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:48,485
I am getting married.

942
01:07:51,052 --> 01:07:52,509
Are you happy with that?

943
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:57,124
What are you saying?
Why I wouldn't be happy?

944
01:07:57,254 --> 01:08:00,395
Your marriage..
We are all so happy about it.

945
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:03,912
Don't you like her?

946
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:09,481
No, no, she's a fine girl,
a good girl.

947
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,296
One day

948
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:15,449
she'll emerge fluttering like a
butterfly from a chrysalis.

949
01:08:16,484 --> 01:08:17,637
'Dear'

950
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:20,365
'Shri Rabindranath Tagore,
my dearest soul mate'

951
01:08:20,495 --> 01:08:26,759
'will tie the nuptial knot next
Sunday afternoon, 9th December.'

952
01:08:27,057 --> 01:08:33,795
'Soliciting your kind presence
at the Jorasanko residence'

953
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:39,697
'of Shri Devendranath Tagore
on the auspicious occasion.'

954
01:08:39,827 --> 01:08:42,758
'Yours as ever
Rabindranath Tagore.'

955
01:08:43,365 --> 01:08:51,871
"As the distant echoes
merge with the tunes near."

956
01:08:52,398 --> 01:09:03,906
"I long for you
my own way, oh dear."

957
01:09:05,348 --> 01:09:13,836
"As darkness fills me
amid all the light."

958
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:28,433
"In dreams as much as real,
day and night."

959
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:40,981
"In the flames nestling
deep inside."

960
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:51,870
"Whose touch it is that
ignites the pain."

961
01:09:53,520 --> 01:10:03,991
"As the distant echoes
merge with the tunes near."

962
01:10:05,844 --> 01:10:15,354
"Wounds of those days
blend with that of the night."

963
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:27,084
"As darkness fills me
amid all the light."

964
01:10:28,316 --> 01:10:32,967
"And the new fragrance"

965
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:40,564
"pervades the old and the dark."

966
01:10:42,142 --> 01:10:52,739
"Which way, pray,
do I sail my raft."

967
01:10:54,300 --> 01:11:04,444
"Where do I head to
be alone, in peace."

968
01:11:06,187 --> 01:11:16,402
"As the distant echoes
merge with the tunes near."

969
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:26,878
"I long for you
my own way, oh dear."

970
01:11:28,812 --> 01:11:39,015
"As darkness fills me
amid all the light."

971
01:11:40,327 --> 01:11:52,543
"In dreams as much as
real, day and night."

972
01:11:54,922 --> 01:12:05,990
"As the distant echoes
merge with the tunes near."

973
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,167
'Depart from here olden one
For now a new game has begun.'

974
01:12:25,061 --> 01:12:25,618
What next?

975
01:12:25,748 --> 01:12:27,680
That's a very funny story.
- Really?

976
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,640
I have a lot more
interesting stories.

977
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,545
I will tell you about it
sometime later.

978
01:13:26,295 --> 01:13:27,562
What is it?

979
01:13:28,586 --> 01:13:29,724
Nothing.

980
01:13:37,656 --> 01:13:39,034
Sister-in-law, I am Robi.

981
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,731
May I come in?
- Come..

982
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,798
Are you unwell?

983
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:55,769
No.

984
01:13:56,713 --> 01:13:57,752
Why?

985
01:13:58,228 --> 01:13:59,758
Why didn't you switch
on the lights?

986
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,653
Aren't you going today?

987
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:07,372
Where?
- Oh don't you know?

988
01:14:08,096 --> 01:14:10,790
Mr. Jyoti's ship is
being launched today.

989
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,581
The ship is in Serampore.

990
01:14:12,711 --> 01:14:13,891
Elder sister-in-law has
been decorating it

991
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:15,054
for the last two days.

992
01:14:15,846 --> 01:14:18,706
Oh yes, of course.

993
01:14:18,836 --> 01:14:20,553
Let's all go together.

994
01:14:22,336 --> 01:14:27,304
Your brother said he would come
and take me there at 6 o'clock.

995
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:34,276
You two go ahead,
I will go with him, separately.

996
01:14:40,628 --> 01:14:41,994
Sister-in-law..

997
01:14:45,062 --> 01:14:50,562
All the letters you wrote
to me are here in this box.

998
01:14:55,217 --> 01:14:56,877
You keep them from today.

999
01:14:58,853 --> 01:15:01,063
So you came to give those back

1000
01:15:02,745 --> 01:15:04,449
not to take me with you?

1001
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,406
'I will stand unabashed
beside my husband today'

1002
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,539
'in my own right.'

1003
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:04,305
'My future lies with him.'

1004
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,987
'He is my refuge.'

1005
01:17:04,628 --> 01:17:06,591
'Decked in sylvan shades'

1006
01:17:06,721 --> 01:17:10,010
'she lies hidden
in her own loveliness.'

1007
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:14,625
'Smiles in faint streaks
flash around'

1008
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:16,843
'and take cover in her
beauteous grace.'

1009
01:17:44,186 --> 01:17:47,722
Holo's Mom!
See if anyone has come?

1010
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:52,061
No, madam!
No one has come yet.

1011
01:20:15,804 --> 01:20:17,013
'Darling..'

1012
01:20:17,143 --> 01:20:19,926
'The happiness and respect
you have given me'

1013
01:20:20,577 --> 01:20:22,702
'it has fulfilled my
many dreams.'

1014
01:20:22,832 --> 01:20:25,284
'But this letter is
to put in writing'

1015
01:20:25,414 --> 01:20:27,511
'what I couldn't
bring myself to say.'

1016
01:20:28,194 --> 01:20:30,415
'After your naughty
games this afternoon'

1017
01:20:30,545 --> 01:20:34,267
'as you lie blissfully
asleep on my bed'

1018
01:20:35,128 --> 01:20:37,599
'I sit beside you writing.'

1019
01:20:38,253 --> 01:20:39,917
'The secret is that a tiny seed'

1020
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:45,742
'of yours is growing
within my body.'

1021
01:20:46,044 --> 01:20:48,706
'I was feeling queasy
for a few days'

1022
01:20:48,836 --> 01:20:50,927
'this month I
didn't menstruate.'

1023
01:20:51,836 --> 01:20:55,456
'I will not reveal the
father's name to anyone'

1024
01:20:55,586 --> 01:20:58,817
'it's between you and me.'

1025
01:20:59,753 --> 01:21:04,075
'The world will know the
child is mine, mine alone.'

1026
01:21:04,707 --> 01:21:07,867
'I do not wish to lose
you at any cost.'

1027
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:10,665
'Accept hundreds of
kisses from me.'

1028
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:12,295
Madam!

1029
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:15,387
'Your very own, Shorojini.'

1030
01:21:15,517 --> 01:21:18,605
Master has sent a
carriage to fetch you.

1031
01:21:19,532 --> 01:21:22,372
He said he couldn't
come himself.

1032
01:21:25,045 --> 01:21:27,550
Shall I stay a little longer,
madam?

1033
01:22:58,181 --> 01:22:59,491
Kadambari.

1034
01:23:00,752 --> 01:23:03,601
What's the matter with you?

1035
01:23:14,027 --> 01:23:15,511
Call the doctor.

1036
01:23:17,077 --> 01:23:18,231
Quick!

1037
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:30,159
'In truth, we live life
in just 64 squares.'

1038
01:23:30,289 --> 01:23:32,498
'A game in black and white.'

1039
01:23:32,628 --> 01:23:34,915
'Knights move two
and a half steps.'

1040
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:36,652
'Bishops and rooks glower.'

1041
01:23:37,191 --> 01:23:41,183
'The Queen is looking
helter-skelter.'

1042
01:23:43,799 --> 01:23:45,997
'as the battle lines encircle.'

1043
01:23:47,086 --> 01:23:50,280
'Then I push up a pawn.'

1044
01:23:50,967 --> 01:23:52,215
'Check.'

1045
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,968
"I have made you"

1046
01:24:01,474 --> 01:24:06,247
"the polar star
of my existence."

1047
01:24:07,003 --> 01:24:11,674
"Never again can I lose my way"

1048
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:16,620
"in the voyage of life."

1049
01:24:17,311 --> 01:24:22,420
"I have made you"

1050
01:24:22,841 --> 01:24:27,800
"the polar star
