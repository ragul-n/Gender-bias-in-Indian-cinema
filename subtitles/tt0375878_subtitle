00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,400
PANAlYUR LAKE, 
40 KMS AWAY FROM PONDlCHERRY

2
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,560
*My life... my life...

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,400
*l'm waiting for you on the
*bank of the river.

4
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
*Though fresh water is being,
*splashed on my face,

5
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
*Yet l'm sweating profusely.

6
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,560
*l was a raging fire.

7
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,999
*l'm still radiating heat even
*after the fire is put out..

8
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,400
*You spread over me like
*the sheet of dew.

9
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
*Time will turn into an enemy and
*moments will become eons.

10
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
*You came closer and
*then just vanished.

11
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,800

*lt is taking me into a new world.
*Dreams are teasing me.

15
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
*Show me girl, which is real
*and which is a dream.

16
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
*Who else will my hands search
*other than you?

17
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
*Don't leave mel
*l'll lose myself.

18
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
*Night has surrounded me.

19
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
*lt's slowly engulfing me.

20
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
*Oh my maiden, come to me,
*l'm searching my dawn in you.

21
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
*lt's death that stalks
*me at my feet.

22
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
*Moments of love are turning
*into bad dreams.

23
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,400
*Come maiden, l want to sleep
*on your lap once.

24
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
*Every moment that is delayed is
*killing me in instalment.

25
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
*Won't you come to me?
*Won't you give your hand to me?

26
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,560
I liked being a cop.

27
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,999
But, there is a life in danger out there,
owing to me.

28
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
I must get up...
I can't.

29
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,999
My body is torn by a couple of bullets.

30
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,999
I've been hit by two bullets seems
like one has torn my intestine.

31
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,999
Aknee cap is shattered.The pain
is excruciating.

32
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,560
But I mustn't die.

33
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,800
They would've kidnapped Maya.

34
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
I must definitely save her.

35
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,999
She needs me.

36
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,960
Get up!

37
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,999
I must get up.

38
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,960
Get up.

39
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,560
My name is Anbuselvan.

40
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,560
Anbuselvan I.P.S.

41
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,999
The initials that follow my name
have been my life.

42
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,999
My penance!

43
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,560
A 23 year penance!

44
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,999
That's when I was selected to
the Indian Police Service.

45
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,999
Life was kind of rudderless until then;

46
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,999
It's never been the same ever since.

47
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I've had my share of memorable
moments, some happy... some not so...

48
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,999
Some hurt.

49
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,560
Some disappointments*..

50
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
At 27, I was inducted into the
Narcotics division, Coimbatore, as ACP.

51
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,999
Two years later, it was
Crime Branch, Madras City.

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,400
Anbuselvan I.P.S.

This's Anbuselvan, Srikanth, Arul,
llamaran, Sathyendran, lntelligence.

54
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Guys, JCP Kumaravel.
- Hello!

55
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,800
You would've heard about him.

56
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,999
He has now been transferred
to Crime Branch.

57
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,999
He'll be with you throughout
the entire operation.

58
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
And of course Mr.Vasudevan Nair.

59
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Crime Branch, Mumbai Police, retired.
Encounter specialist!

60
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,999
He has been involved in 27 encounters.

61
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He has single handedly put down
24 gangsters in one year.

62
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,999
He's one of the best.

63
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Vasudevan is a good friend too.

64
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,999
l've requested him to be
an advisor to you.

65
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,400
Gladly!
- This's my Criminal lntelligence Unit.

66
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,800
This team was assembled by me.

67
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,800
These guys are hand picked by me.

68
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
And will report directly to me.

69
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Vasu, Anbuselvan & Srikanth worked
together in Coimbatore Narcotics Div.

70
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Arul & llamaran worked together
in Tuticorin in Law & Order.

71
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,400
They were together in
Commando Training.

72
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,560
These dossiers,

73
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
contain the reports of 4 main gangsters
in Tamil Nadu.

74
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Agaram Sethu!

75
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
Manali Gaja!

76
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,560
Petrol bunk Sekar!

77
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
Aasai!

78
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,400
We are getting information
about them everyday.

79
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,999
We've information that Aasai will be
in city for a pick up in 3 days.

80
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,999
We are waiting for your instructions.

81
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,999
We are ready for the hunt.

82
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
28 encounters.

83
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,560
ln Bombay city alone!

84
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,400
27 were successful and 1 was a failure.

85
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,999
But every body only talked
about the operation that failed.

86
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,999
So the whole department will
be watching you.

87
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,999
To see what you're able to pull off.

88
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,999
You can do it.

89
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,999
lt's all in the mind.These operations
require a totally different mind set.

90
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,560
Everything is here!

91
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,999
From the moment you drop a gangster
dead, life is never going to be same.

92
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,999
Their familes and gangs
won't take it silently.

93
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,999
They'll think you came there with the
premeditated idea of killing the gangster.

94
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,560
They'll seek revenge!

95
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,999
And most of the time they
don't target your life,

96
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,999
but your courage and the
lives of your dear ones.

97
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,400
There were 3 of us. We knew no fear.

98
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,800
They called us "The untouchables".

99
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,999
l am near Kasi Theatre.
Keep the money ready.

100
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
lf you inform the Police...

101
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,560
Petrol Bunk Sekar...

102
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,999
There may be 4 or 5 people inside.
- We should have called for more backup.

103
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,400
Why do we always
have to play supermen?

104
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,960
Freeze!

105
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,400
Are you okay?
- l'm okay... l'm okay.

106
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Sir... sir...

107
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Brother Gaja & Sethu, Police...

108
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
Perumal!

109
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,960
God!

110
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,960
Police!

111
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,999
What's your name?

112
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
They've told me about you.

113
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
You'll not leave this place alive.

114
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
Manali Gaja!

115
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,400
ls he the guy?
- Yes, it's him Dharma.

116
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,999
Anbu, Arul is waiting
for our phone call.

117
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,999
What shall we do now?

118
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,560
Shall we arrest him?

119
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Why should we arrest him?

120
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,999
Anbu, there are no cases registered
against him with the police.

121
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,999
But the information collected about him,
by the department is true.

122
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
He's a rogue... Rapist!
all young girls.

123
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,400
2 months ago, a 16 year
old girl called Devi,

124
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,999
was raped by him mercilessly in a
moving train at 10 p.m.

125
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,800
There were 3 eye witnesses.

126
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,800
But no one came to give evidence.

127
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,560
But he was the rapist.

128
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
He's backed by a minister,
so he always escapes.

129
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,999
Devi is in the hospital now.
lf we arrest him,

130
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
we can get him punished
with Devi's evidence.

131
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
lf Devi can come out of the hospital,

132
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
if Devi is able to speak,

133
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,560
lf Devi can write.

134
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,560
ls it possible for her?

135
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
They're...

136
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
ls he dead?

137
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,999
lf he's arrested, Government has to
spend money unnecessarily.

138
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,999
We must use a vehicle,
and fill it up with diesel...

139
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,999
4 of our department people
in uniform must secure them,

140
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,560
Court... Judge...

141
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,999
Now, we've just spent the price
of one bullet!

142
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,999
From my pocket!

143
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Just Rs. 50!

144
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,999
Devi will be very happy
to hear this, won't she?

145
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,800
We've done with him, haven't we?

146
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,560
This is atrocious!

147
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Some one had to do something
about this somewhere.

148
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Human rights & life aren't
respected in this country.

149
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,560
Just a minute, madam.

150
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,999
3 days earlier,

151
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,999
2 people were standing suspiciously
near llamaran's house.

152
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,999
When we questioned them,

153
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,999
We discovered that one of them
was Gaja's brother.

154
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The lntelligence report sent on the
18th is on your table.

155
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,999
Last month on the 14th,
Petrol Bunk Sekar's gang,

156
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,999
met and discussed in Chintadaripet,

157
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,999
They've planned to kill all 4 of us
before next 'Pongal' festival.

158
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,999
They've taken a vow
before Sekar's wife.

159
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Asai, Gaja, Petrol Bunk Sekar..
Do we've any personal enemity with them?

160
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
But for doing our duty,
this is our reward.

161
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,999
So, what's the point?

162
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,999
My point Madam is,

163
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,999
from ensuring that society can avail of small
liberties to the protection of their lives.

164
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,800
lt needs a policeman's sacrifice.

165
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,999
l don't need to hear
any of this, Mr. Anbuselvan.

166
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
We're talking about Human Rights.

167
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
Not just that!

168
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
l'm very clear as far as
l'm concerned.

169
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
My recommendations are ready.

170
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,999
Madam, you're talking
about Human Rights,

171
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
And Human Rights violations.

172
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,800
Human Rights are for humans only.

173
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,999
For us, all those three were not
humans at all.

174
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
lf you want to punish us,

175
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,999
punish us under the
act of Killing animals.

176
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,999
We'll accept.

177
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
6 months in the crime branch
was like walking on land mines.

178
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
Enough of this fear of
dying every moment.

179
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,400
lnfact we must be
celebrating this event.

180
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,999
You've fulfilled the task given
to you, haven't you?

181
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,560
No Swathi, not yet over.

182
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,960
Sethu!

183
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,560
Sethu has escaped.

184
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,999
lf any other man had escaped
he wouldn't be a threat.

185
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,560
We should have got him.

186
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,560
He's the kingpin.

187
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,999
l wouldn't have bothered if l was
transferred after that.

188
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,800
This transfer is temporary Anbu.

189
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Why do you call it transfer?

190
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,999
Watch, we'll be shifted
back to crime branch.

191
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
They can't do without us.

192
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,200
Let's go.

193
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,999
lla come let's go.

194
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,999
Srikanth was right but
I was'nt able to forget Sethu.

195
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,400
I had a hunch that I
would get him one day.

196
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,999
All 3 of us were transferred
to different departments.

197
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,999
I was transferred from the Crime branch
to the Control room.

198
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,400
Control Room! Nothing much to sweat over.

199
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,999
Small fry.

200
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,999
But that's how the department functions.

201
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,560
No posting is permanent.

202
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I was happy to do whatever job
that was assigned to me.

203
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,200
Madras City...

204
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,200
Keep your eyes open, and you'd find all
kinds of creeps all over the place, all the time.

205
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,960
Stop!

206
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,800
Boss, you do it! 
- Yes.

207
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,800
Hey, what are you doing there?

208
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,999
Just sitting here sir.
- Don't you've homes?

209
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
We have sir, we were
just talking.

210
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We shouldn't sit here, Sir?
We shouldn't talk here, Sir?

211
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,800
You can sit anywhere you like.

212
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,999
lf you aren't a nuisance to anyone.

213
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,560
Hey, turn back.

214
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,560
Hacksaw blade... wire...

215
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,999
Come on move.
- Key sir.
- Come to station tomorrow morning & take it.

216
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,999
Sir, l want the key.
- Hey, come on get going.

217
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,999
Go... didn't he tell you to go..
come on scram.

218
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,999
What's this sir? 
You're behaving high handedly.
- Go... go... go..

219
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,999
They don't have guts to catch 'Veerappan'.
- They're bullying us.

220
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,999
Hey! Stop... what did you say?
- Kathamuthu, what was it?

221
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,999
They're saying that we don't have
guts to catch 'Veerappan'.

222
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Hey! stop!
- Kathamuthu! Hey, go reach home safely.

223
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
They were right, weren't they?
We've failed to catch Veerappan.

224
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,560
"No guts" is all humbug.

225
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,999
I'm a loner!

226
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I had very few emotional attachments.
That was my strength.

227
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,600
I had a certain freedom and courage that
married officers couldn't afford.

228
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I didn't know what fear was.
I could stand upto anyone, anywhere.

229
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I didn't have to worry, or be
responsible for anyone. I liked that.

230
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
And then one day, Maya walked into my life.

231
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Maya... my beautiful Maya.

232
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,999
My most beautiful Maya.

233
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
*She's fantasy

234
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,560
*She's harmony.

235
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,560
*She's mystery.

236
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,560
*She's ecstasy.

237
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
*ln a place there lived a girl.
*She was beauty personified.

238
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,800
*She was born to define beauty.

239
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
*When l see the places,
*she moves around.

240
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,400
*You feel as if you know her for years.

241
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
*There'll be desires in everything
*seen at the first sight.

242
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
*She'll charm you at first sight.

243
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
*She'll stretch her
*limbs beautifully.

244
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,800
*She'll thrill like the flower.

245
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
*When she talks making
*gestures with the finger,

246
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,400
*We feel, there's lute in the wind.

247
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
*ln the dimple of her cheek.
* We can plant little sapling,

248
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,400
*ln the dimple on her cheek
*- Beautifully...

249
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
*We can plant little saplings.
*- Wide variety...

250
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
*We find something different
*and attractive in her.

251
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
*Like flowers holding pollen.

252
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,400
*There's a special fragrance in her.

253
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,400
*The beautiful folds of her
*sari are fans.

254
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,400
*The tresses on her shoulders
*are dark forests.

255
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,560
*When she passes by you,

256
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,800
*Head turns involuntarily.

257
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,400
*When she passes by you,
*- Definitely...

258
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,999
*Your head will turn involuntarily.
*- To see her...

259
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,560
*What am l to say?...

260
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,400
*l want to tell more about her but...

261
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I had met a few girls in my life,
but no one affected me like her.

262
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
And at first sight too...

263
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
Shanthi, come this side.
ldiot!

264
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Hey! take a U-turn.
- Sir? 
-Take a U-turn fast.

265
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,999
Yesterday you said you'd spit on me...

266
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,400
Today l'm grabbing your scarf, now what?

267
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,800
What're you doing?
You rogue...

268
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
Are you all students?
Which college?

269
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,999
l've broken your tooth...
will you go home like this?

270
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,800
What will you tell your mother?

271
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,999
And you... think you're some great hero?

272
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,960
Oh God!

273
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,800
That was the first time I saw her.

274
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
Get lost.

275
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'll never forget the anger and
fear in her eyes.

276
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,560
It was her again...

277
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
For the first time since college,
I wanted to keep looking at a girl.

278
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
I didn't believe in fate,

279
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,800
but I kept running into her.

280
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
Would you like to come in?

281
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Excuse me.

282
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,999
Your anklet.

283
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,400
l think you dropped it.
l found it in the lift.

284
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,400
lsn't it yours?
- No... and you know it.

285
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,999
Excuse me! That's mine.
You found it in the lift?

286
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,560
Take it.. 
- Thanks.

287
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,999
Kathamuthu, tell him
l've come to the spot.

288
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,560
No one must stand there.

289
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Give me one kilogram of sugar,
one packet of flour & a Bru coffee.

290
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,200
Okay, madam.

291
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,960
Hello.

292
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,560
Make it quick please.

293
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,200
Excuse me.

294
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,400
Do you live around here?
Where's your house?

295
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,560
Give me a coconut also.

296
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,400
Hello! l'm talking to you.
Where's your house?

297
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,400
Do l know you?
l don't need to answer you.

298
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,400
She didn't like me. But I liked her attitude.

299
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,560
Take the money.

300
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,400
l'll take the change later.
- Okay, madam.

301
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I wasn't an expert on girls. But I felt that
a woman should be like her.

302
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,999
Sir, l'll drop my friend home
and come back to you.

303
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,999
Give me just half-an-hour.
- Do l have to sit here till you come back?

304
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,800
l can't wait. Pay the fine and go.

305
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,999
l don't have any money.
Whatever l had l spent on the movie...

306
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,999
and the vehicle belongs to my friend.

307
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,999
l have my license, insurance and
registration... but they are all at home.

308
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,999
lf you come with me, l'll show you, sir.

309
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,999
Give me 30 minutes, l'll drop her
and show you all the documents.

310
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,800
I saw her again 2 weeks later.

311
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,800
Sir!
- What's the problem?

312
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,999
He doesn't have his papers
or his license,

313
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,560
and he's being insolent.

314
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,800
Get down from the vehicle.

315
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,400
What's your name?
-Raja! ..you know me, sir.

316
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,800
Asst. Commissioner Anbuselvan.

317
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
We solved a land problem together,
in Trustpuram. Do you remember?

318
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,560
What's your name?

319
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Maya

320
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Where's your house?
-No.3, Kasturibai Nagar, Adayar.

321
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,800
You refused to tell me earlier.

322
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Where are you coming from?
- We're coming from watching a movie.

323
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,999
Do you have the tickets?

324
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,600
The tickets had coupons for free juice,
from the Juice Shop on Greams Road.

325
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,999
We used the tickets there.

326
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,999
Who's she? Your sister?
- No sir! We are friends.

327
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,400
Friends means?
- Friends means friends.

328
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,999
Why are you using this road? That's why
we've put barricades here.

329
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,560
Why did you cross them?

330
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,999
You're using it because it is shorter route.
But it's not safe till we set it right again.

331
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,999
And at this time of night,
with a girl by your side...

332
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,400
shouldn't you be carrying all your papers?

333
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,800
Sorry sir.
- Okay, carry on.

334
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,800
Give him the keys.
- Okay sir.

335
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,560
Give him his keys.

336
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,999
l've taken the commissioner's signature.
Don't wait for him.

337
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,999
He's a little busy. You go and present
this file in the Court.

338
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,400
l'll talk to you in the evening.
- Okay sir.

339
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,200
Hello sir.

340
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,800
I met her again
a month later.

341
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,960
Hello!

342
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,400
My name is Maya.
- l know. l remember.

343
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,400
l want to say sorry.
l was a little harsh.

344
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
l didn't know then that you
were a police officer.

345
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,999
l understood that from your dirty look.

346
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Did you think l was using the anklet
as a pretext to talk to you?

347
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So, you've realized that police officers
don't roam around with anklets.

348
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,960
Right?

349
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,999
People have a special respect
for the police, don't they?

350
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,800
Good! Go ahead... tell me.

351
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,400
What?
- You said you wanted to apologize.

352
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,999
l'm sorry sir.
l'm really sorry sir.

353
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,800
Your apology is accepted.

354
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
lt's good not to talk to strangers...
but don't misjudge people, either.

355
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,400
What are you doing here?
- Sports day!

356
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,560
Student?
- Teacher!

357
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,400
You're a teacher in St. Stephens school...
Maya.

358
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,600
What subjects do you teach? 
- Maths, computer science... 
10th & 12th grade.

359
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Maths for 12th grade - very tough!

360
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What's your qualification?
- MSc. Maths... llT Madras.

361
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,400
llT students can get
good jobs in America.

362
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
How come you're a teacher here?
- l like teaching.

363
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
l read an article about you,
in last week's Express.

364
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
Very impressive sir.
- Thanks.

365
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,999
And l'm sorry...
l'm really sorry.

366
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
Don't worry about it, okay?

367
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,560
Bye...
- Bye...

368
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,999
Hello. 
- Anbuselvan sir?
- Speaking, who's this?

369
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
Sir, l'm Maya speaking.
Do you remember me?

370
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,400
St. Stephens school.
- Maya... 12th grade maths.

371
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,400
l do remember you...
Tell me, what's the matter?

372
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,999
l wanted to talk to you...
l got this number.

373
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,999
Can we speak on this line?
- Yeah, no problem!

374
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Sir, l'm calling from school...
we have a problem here.

375
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
l need your help.
Can you meet me at the school?

376
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
Hello.
- Sorry sir, for calling you here.

377
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Don't worry. What's the problem? Tell me.
- Thanks for coming.

378
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,999
This is my student Roshini.
- Hello... Roshini. 
- Hello sir.

379
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,999
Her house is in Aminjikarai.
lt's not a very good area.

380
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,800
A boy there is harassing her.

381
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,999
lt has been happening every day,
for a while now.

382
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
She can't tell her family.

383
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,600
There are 4 or 5 men in the gang. They
have threatened to pour acid on her face.

384
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,999
They followed her to the school
this morning.

385
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
She saw them on the bus
and they were here after school also.

386
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,800
What do you think we should do?

387
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,800
Can the police take any action?

388
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,600
Do l have to lodge a formal complaint?
l don't want her to face any problems.

389
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay, both of you come with me.
Get into the jeep.

390
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,560
Are they here, Roshini?

391
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
They're standing near that auto.

392
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,800
Get down and walk over there.

393
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,960
Sir?

394
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
Don't be afraid. l'm here.

395
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Don't let them know l'm here.
Get down & walk.

396
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,999
Hey chickee, think you can slip by silently

397
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,800
if you come home late from school?

398
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,999
Come here. Come over here!
lf you don't come now,

399
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,999
l'll barge into your house and
throw acid on your mother's face.

400
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,200
Get over here!

401
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,999
Come... why are you turning away
when l'm calling you?

402
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
Don't you like me?
lsn't my face handsome?

403
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
What have you got to lose
by going out with me?

404
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,999
l'm a cool guy.
Why are you making me angry?

405
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,999
Boys, tell her.
- Why are you making him angry?

406
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,999
Didn't he tell you he's a cool guy?

407
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,999
Can't you cut classes & go out with me?
Why are you so reluctant?

408
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,999
Hey. 
- Hey, no need to talk to her.
Pour acid on her face.

409
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Only then she'll understand.
- Come on, give him the acid.

410
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
Throw it man.
- No... no... please. No.

411
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Do you know what will happen if l
throw this? Should l do it?

412
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,200
Who's he?

413
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,960
Police!

414
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Sir... sir... we were just joking, sir.
Just like that.

415
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,400
lt isn't acid...
it's just plain water.

416
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,960
Sir..

417
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,800
Just like that.
Just joking.

418
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
No bullet. Just an empty pistol.
Got scared?

419
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800
Come here man!
- l'm a devotee.

420
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,560
Devotee? Go away.

421
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,960
Rogue.

422
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,999
Roshini, go home.

423
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,999
You won't face any more
problems in the future.

424
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,800
Walk bravely down the street.

425
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,400
Remember to walk with
your head held high, okay?

426
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,999
Thank you sir.

427
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,560
l'll get down here.

428
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,560
Are you sure? 
- Yes.

429
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
lf it had really been acid?
- My face would have been disfigured.

430
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,400
l can't even think about it.
Thank God!

431
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,200
Thank you.

432
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,999
After that, her face and her eyes used
to haunt me.

433
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,800
Like they were etched in my mind.

434
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,999
I didn't understand
what was happening to me.

435
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm couldn't tell if
I liked it or not.

436
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,999
What's this, Anbu? Your punches have
gone soft.

437
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
What's happened to you?
-Oh yeah?

438
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
Yes.
- Okay.

439
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Okay, eat this.
- Come on...

440
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,200
Let's go.

441
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,560
Hello sir...
- Hello.

442
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
l was sitting with a friend in the
coffee shop over there... l saw you.

443
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,800
Would you like to join us?

444
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,560
Sorry, l'm on duty now.

445
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,999
The Chief Minister is coming this way,
l need to be here.

446
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,560
Thanks. You carry on.

447
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,999
So join us after the CM is gone.
We'll wait for you.

448
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,560
Will you join us then?

449
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,999
l'm not sure. l don't know how
much time it'll take.

450
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Don't wait for me.
You carry on, okay?

451
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,560
Okay... bye.
- Bye...

452
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Sir, is that your future wife?
- Mind your own business, Kathamuthu.

453
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,999
Tears which had long forgotten
to drop from my eyes...

454
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,800
fell on her forehead that day.

455
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,400
I had seen many terrible accidents.

456
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,400
Grizzly murders, disgusting scenes...

457
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,800
nothing ever really disturbed me.

458
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,400
But when I saw her badly hurt,
it killed me.

459
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,999
Kathamuthu - her name is Maya.
She's a teacher in St.Stephens.

460
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,999
lnform the school, and tell them
to inform her house also.

461
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,999
Give them my mobile number.
- Okay, sir.

462
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,999
No... no... today is Sunday.
School will be closed.

463
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,999
Call the principal at his
house & inform him.

464
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,999
There's a coffee shop next to the
place we were standing.

465
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,400
She said she had come
there with a friend.

466
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Let's wait for 24 hours, 
l think she should come around 
- Ok doctor.

467
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,960
Hello!

468
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,560
Hello sir. How are you?

469
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,200
How are you?

470
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,560
lt's very painful.

471
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,560
You'll be alright.

472
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,560
l'll get the doctor.

473
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,400
ACP sir...
[Assistant Commissioner of Police]

474
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,800
You missed the CM after all.

475
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,999
lnstead, you were taking me to the
hospital in your car.

476
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Couldn't you have joined me for
a coffee when l invited you?

477
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,400
Why are you so serious?
l was just kidding.

478
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
l kept looking at you...
l forgot to look in front of me.

479
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
For the first time in our city,
the water tanker won't be accused.

480
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,400
Hello! 
- Hello.
- She's Arthi, Maya's sister.

481
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,400
What happened? How is she now?
- She's okay now.

482
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,999
She was hit by a water tanker
on Mount Road.

483
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,400
She sustained head & limb injuries...

484
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,400
but she'll recover.
You can go in & see her.

485
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,999
*You're spending half your time
*at the hospital.

486
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,400
*l went to see her twice.
*That's all.

487
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But l'm always thinking about her,
even when l'm working.

488
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,999
So you've finally come around.
So this is it.

489
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,800
Finally, you've fallen in love.

490
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,999
Nothing like that
and l don't need it also.

491
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,600
She met with an accident because of me.
A little guilty feeling, that's all.

492
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,400
You told me once,
nice guys get nice girls.

493
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
She's definitely a nice girl. But l don't
want to be that nice guy.

494
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
She made me cry that day.
l didn't like it.

495
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,800
l've decided not to see her again.

496
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,800
But I had to meet her again.

497
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,999
You knew you were coming to see me.
Couldn't you bring me a flower bouquet?

498
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,560
You're taking out a gun?

499
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,600
You may be a big time police official,
and everyone might be scared of you.

500
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But, you have no clue how to
talk to a woman, or how to act.

501
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,560
Accept it.
- Agreed.

502
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,400
You're very uncomfortable, am l correct?
Why?

503
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,800
No, it's this chair.
- The chair?

504
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,400
Your sister seems uncomfortable
around me.

505
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,400
l noticed in the hospital.
Did you ask her why?

506
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
l know. You're a police officer who is
talking to me, that's why.

507
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,999
Offenders and criminals
should be uncomfortable around me.

508
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,999
Why should others feel uncomfortable?

509
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,600
Are you saying my sister is a criminal?
- No! l'm just saying, we are normal people.

510
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,999
We are normal people
and l'm a normal person.

511
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,999
That's what l wanted to say.
Please tell this to your sister also.

512
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,200
Oh yeah?

513
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,400
Well, time will tell how normal
you really are.

514
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,400
Thanks for accepting
my invitation.

515
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,800
Why are you acting so formal?

516
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You might have been busy,
but l decided l had to meet you today.

517
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,999
lt's a long time since l've
been out of the house.

518
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
l thought you could give me an update on
what's happening in the country.

519
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,800
ls the city peaceful, ACP sir?

520
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,400
With you around,
l guess it must be peaceful.

521
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,999
Actually, l'm not that busy.
Just in the control room...

522
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,999
l'm depressed. l've wasted
3 months of my life...

523
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,560
staring at four walls.

524
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So, l'm planning to go to Pondicherry
tomorrow, to my sister's house.

525
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
My sister also left then itself.
l feel like seeing her.

526
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,200
ACP sir...

527
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,800
Would you like to come with me?

528
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,400
You said you weren't busy.
You must come.

529
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
l'm taking you to a beautiful place.
You'll love it.

530
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,560
Come... please.

531
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,560
*New experience.

532
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,800
*lt'll grow manifolds in a second.

533
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,800
*lt'll bring 2 lives together.

534
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,400
*Changing me, becoming a
*part of my heart,

535
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,800
*you don't kill me slowly.

536
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
*ls today any different from yesterday?
*Am l the same man today also?

537
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,800
*Don't charm me with your talk.

538
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,800
*l want to say one thing...

539
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,999
*l must look into your
*face & say that.

540
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,800
*Shouldn't we two be alone here?

541
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,400
*l've also changed.
*l've become more soft.

542
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,400
*lf you know it,
*why don't you tell me?

543
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,400
*Whom should l ask?
*Won't you tell me?

544
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,400
*On the way there are
*flower gardens.

545
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
*Never once l had stopped
*and admired their beauty.

546
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
*l never thought l'll stop and
*pluck a flower to admire it.

547
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,400
*The flower you pluck,
*l'll adorn in my hair.

548
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,800
*l've this intention now.

549
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
*But, like always, it's silence
*that speaks for me.

550
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,800
*l'm developing wings like birds.

551
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,800
*and flying beyond stars.

552
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,999
l don't know if there's any place more
beautiful than this in the world.

553
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,800
l don't want to know also.

554
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,560
This wood house is ours.

555
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
When my parents were alive, we used
spend all our week ends here.

556
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,400
This house has seen my
days of joy & grief.

557
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,800
l felt you must come here.

558
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,400
*You've made me come here and
*made me talk.

559
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,560
*You made me smile.

560
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
*What's the meaning of
*the mischief in your eyes?

561
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
*My outlook is new, my thoughts are new.
*l've changed because of you.

562
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,400
*Your eyes must search
*me in a crowd.

563
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,400
*l've gone mad with
*such crazy ideas.

564
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,800
Shall we go?
lt's getting late.

565
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,400
l had a good time
after a long time.

566
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,200
Thanks to you.

567
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,560
l want to talk to you.

568
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,400
Don't look at your watch,
l have to talk.

569
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,999
There is something l know about you.

570
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,200
What's it?

571
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,400
lt happened on the day of the accident

572
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That day when the water tanker hit me
l fell as if somebody threw me.

573
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,560
There was terrible pain.

574
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,560
l couldn't bear it.

575
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,400
Suddenly l felt l was being
carried by someone.

576
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,560
ACP Anbuselvan!

577
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,960
l saw.

578
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,400
You made me sleep on
your lap in the car.

579
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,960
l saw.

580
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,999
Your shirt was drenched
with my blood.

581
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,999
You tied a kerchief
to stop the bleeding.

582
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,400
You ordered the driver
Kathamuthu to go fast.

583
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,800
l knew all of it then itself.

584
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,560
l was watching it all.

585
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,560
You cried then.

586
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,960
Why?

587
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,999
Later you got me
admitted in a hospital.

588
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,560
l plunged in to darkness

589
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,800
But, l knew l wouldn't die.

590
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,800
At that moment, l prayed.

591
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That when l regain consciousness
you should be there.

592
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,560
l must see you first.

593
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,200
lt happened.

594
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Those tears might have dropped
even for someone else in your lap.

595
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,200
May be...

596
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,999
But, there was no one else
in my place...

597
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,560
Only l was there.

598
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
When l opened my eyes in the
hospital, you were there.

599
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,560
l didn't feel any pain.

600
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,200
l felt happy.

601
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,800
l'm telling you unabashedly

602
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,800
Actually l don't feel shy.

603
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,999
l love you.

604
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,400
Truly... madly... deeply...
- No, Maya.

605
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,400
Don't say you love me.
Please don't.

606
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,999
Until now, before you called it love

607
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,999
We had something special between us.

608
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,560
That was very nice.

609
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,560
Let it be like that.

610
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,400
l should've expected this.
lt was my mistake.

611
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,800
l don't want to give any excuses.

612
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,560
l'm used to being alone.

613
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,560
l like it that way.

614
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,400
There's no place for another
person in my home.

615
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,800
Literally and even otherwise

616
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,800
Did l ask your opinion about me?

617
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,800
Did l ask you to accept my love?

618
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,400
l just wanted to tell
what l had in my mind

619
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,400
l knew that this is what you'll say.

620
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,800
Let's go Anbuselvan...let's go.

621
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,400
She was changing me,
infront of my own eyes.

622
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,400
She was changing my world,
I didn't like that.

623
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,800
I wanted to go faraway from her.

624
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,560
But, I couldn't.

625
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,560
Hello Maya, how are you?

626
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,999
l'm fine.

627
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,999
Have you started going
to school again?

628
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,800
Mm, it's been 2 weeks now.

629
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,999
Have you come to see me?

630
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,800
l don't know anyone else here.

631
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,200
Okay, come.

632
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,800
l'm not able to concentrate.

633
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,800
l'm not able to take classes.

634
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,800
l've forgotten my mathematics.

635
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,999
l'm not able to talk to any one
freely in school.

636
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,400
l've lost appetite,
l'm sleepless.

637
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,400
l've come to tell you,
it's because of you only.

638
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,800
First l thought l'll never come,

639
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,560
and will never see you.

640
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,560
Because l hate pleading.

641
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,800
But now, l'm not bothered.

642
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,200
l like you.

643
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,400
l've come here to ask
you to accept my love.

644
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,999
One more thing.

645
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,400
You said earlier that you were
a normal person.

646
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,999
l'm sorry.

647
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,800
You're not a normal person.

648
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,999
lf you were normal,

649
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,400
You wouldn't have discarded my love.

650
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,560
What she says is right.

651
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,800
You're not a normal person.

652
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,800
l love you... truly... madly.

653
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,400
l'm sorry. You're not a normal person.

654
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
lf you were normal, you wouldn't have
discarded my love.

655
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,400
Okay, see you tomorrow.
- Bye Maya.

656
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,800
ACP sir, it's surprising.

657
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,999
How come you're here...

658
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,800
l don't know anyone else here.

659
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,800
l need to talk a lot to you.

660
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,200
Shall we?

661
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,200
l love to.

662
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,960
Come.

663
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,560
Maya, what do you want?

664
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,560
l don't get you.

665
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,999
With regard to both of us
what do you want?

666
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,800
l should get married to you.

667
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,800
l should spend my life with you.

668
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,999
l should be with you.

669
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,800
l want to talk to you happily.

670
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,999
l want to fight with you.

671
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,999
l want to cry in your arms.

672
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,400
l should be mad about you
always as l'm now.

673
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,800
l want to make love to you.

674
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,999
You should have 3 children.

675
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,400
They must be like you in
appearance & character.

676
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,800
l must see these eyes, always.

677
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,800
Then, one day l should die.

678
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,999
That's all.

679
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,960
Why?

680
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,999
l'm not a jolly, youthful person...

681
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,560
l'm a police officer.

682
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,999
There is danger around me.

683
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,999
lt'll affect people
closer to me also.

684
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,800
l'm elder to you by 6 years.

685
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,960
Why me?

686
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,999
lt's a girl thing.

687
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,560
You wouldn't understand.

688
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,800
You should see it as a girl.

689
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,200
Okay... okay.

690
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,200
Let's marry.

691
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,560
l like you, Maya.

692
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,400
Ever since the day
l saw you for the first time,

693
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,560
l didn't show it.

694
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,560
l can't hide it anymore.

695
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,800
A month from now, let's marry.

696
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,960
Okay?

697
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
A drop of tear in her eyes.
A flash of happiness on her face.

698
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
She gave a contented look.
I can never forget it.

699
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,400
I decided right then to live a life with her.

700
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,560
After a week...

701
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,800
Srikanth, Arul, Ilamaran and me,

702
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
we all four were again transferred
to the crime branch.

703
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,999
We re-opened gangster Sethu's file.

704
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,800
Operation Sethu took place.

705
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,560
10 days prior to this.

706
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,560
Pandia entered my life.

707
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,999
Pandia...

708
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,800
born and brought up in Salem.

709
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
At 19, he killed his father and
ran away to Bombay.

710
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,999
8 years later...

711
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Maharashtra Police is after him with
32 criminal cases against him.

712
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
15 extortions, 9 murders, 5 kidnappings,
1 dacoity... one bank robbery.

713
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,400
Finally, murder of a
local MLAAshwin Naik.

714
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,999
Hey, hands up.

715
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,800
Mumbai police arrested Pandia.

716
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,800
He was in jail for 6 months.

717
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,560
6 months 8 days.

718
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,800
On the 9th day. He escaped.

719
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,800
It created a sensation in Mumbai.

720
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Pandia reached Chennai after
escaping from Mumbai.

721
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
When we re-opened Sethu's file,
we went through his history.

722
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,560
OLD JETTY KATTUCHERY

723
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,999
There was only one information
we didn't know then.

724
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,999
That Pandia, who had
escaped from Mumbai,

725
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,999
is the brother of Sethu
whom the crime branch is tracking.

726
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,560
This is our place.

727
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,999
These are all our boys.

728
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,800
They'll give their lives for me.

729
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,200
For you too.

730
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Pandia, when l heard you were
in jail, l was stunned.

731
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,400
l was at a lose
didn't no what to do

732
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,560
l just sat like that.

733
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,999
Police, have become a
big problem here also.

734
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,999
Police...

735
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,999
Brother, there is a police officer
called Shinde, in Mumbai,

736
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,999
he only beat me up badly in jail also.

737
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,999
He'll die in another 30 minutes.
But do you know how?

738
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,999
There won't be a scratch on his body.

739
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,999
Our boys would've got down
to business by now.

740
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,800
He has a 17 year old son.

741
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,999
They'll kidnap him and
confine him for 2 days.

742
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,800
Giving a torrid time to Shinde.

743
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,999
Two days later they'll send his
son's corpse in a parcel.

744
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,999
All policemen will get the right message,

745
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
They'll think twice before
getting in to the field boldly.

746
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,999
They'll fear us.
- That's what we need.

747
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,800
There're few people here also.

748
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,999
Only if we do something
like this, they'll learn a lesson.

749
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,400
We'll do it.
- Sethu, our Pandia has come.

750
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,999
Like they put up cut-outs
on a Minister's arrival,

751
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,999
shall we put up a cut-out
for our Pandia?

752
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,400
That too opposite
Commissioner's office.

753
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Hey, l've a cut-out for him here.
- Sethu, super.

754
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Sethu, we'll give Pandia something
like school children give flowers.

755
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,999
No one must give us flowers.

756
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,999
He's Producer's son.

757
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,560
Are you Arun?
- Yes.

758
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,999
We'll give it to someone.

759
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Your father told us to bring you
to the studio. Shall we go?

760
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,200
Hello!... Yes.

761
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,560
l've kidnapped your son.

762
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,400
lf you want him, bring
25 lakhs & take him.

763
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Your film shoot is going on. So
money won't be a problem to you.

764
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,999
What do you say? l'll tell you
only once. Don't go to the police.

765
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,400
Then, it'll not just be a kidnap case.

766
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,800
Does Seetharaman have the money?

767
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,400
Definitely he has. He's rolling in money.

768
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,999
He's a powerful person.

769
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Despite so many warnings if he has
gone to police, it means...

770
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,400
Arun, l think your father
doesn't care for you

771
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,560
What's your age?
- 11.

772
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Brother, Seetharaman hasn't
understood the gravity.

773
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,800
Let's make him aware of it.

774
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,400
Hey, what're you dropping?
Hey... stop...

775
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,800
Hello! 
- ls that Seetharaman?

776
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,999
Hey Bastard! l told you once,
but l told you clearly

777
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,999
not go to police.Told you
we'll settle it between us.

778
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,999
But, you didn't listen.

779
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Your son Arun who should be
playing in your house is lying dead there.

780
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,999
ls this necessary?

781
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,800
Hey! Bastard... your mother...
