Hey!

91

Are you a school kid?

92
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,000
You run at once on hearing the bell.

93
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,083
One more minute

94
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:11,500
and everything will be done.

95
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,542
If I don't open the door on the
third ring, she'll definitely leave.

96
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,792
Then I'll have to
do all the work.

97
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,250
Your one minute of pleasure

98

99
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:21,750
Get lost.

Hey!

101
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,625
Hey!
Why do you have a long face?

102
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,667
Ganga!

103
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,125
Put the clothes from the washing
machine in to the dryer.

104
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,167
Okay, ma'am.

105
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,042
Hey!

106
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,500
Who gave you
the permission to kiss me?

107
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:02,167
I thought the chutney was spicy.

108
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,417
But it seems right.

109
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,417
Really?

110
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,542
<i>Look, didn't I tell you?</i>

111
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:13,750

112
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,292
<i>New neighbors.</i>

113
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,625

114
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,083
Silent Hill Hospital.

115
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,208
It's a modern neuro surgery, Lokesh.

116
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,125
I've just cut open your head.

117
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,958
And you're very much
in your senses.

118
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,292
Did it hurt?

119
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,208
No, right?

120
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,833
Confirm target point.

121
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay!

122
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,667
I'll be inserting these
electrodes in to your brain.

123
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,792
You might feel a mild tickle,
but it won't pain.

124
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,917
You stopped playing cricket
after Parkinson's, right?

125
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's play cricket now.

126
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,500
You'll stop the
shivering in your hand.

127
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,542
Then, you'll show me a leg spin.

128
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,458
Okay?

129
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,542
Let's give it a try.

130
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,833
Go.

131
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,208
Excellent!

132
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,458
One more time, Lokesh.

133
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,958
Come on, keep doing it.

134
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:13,792
<i>Nice.</i>

135
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:14,750
<i>Didn't I say</i>

136
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,875
<i>that it's a simple procedure</i>
<i>and will be done soon?</i>

137
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,875
Okay, Okay.
Don't strain it so much.

138
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,917
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

139
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,292
India's number one

140
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,542

Krish!

143
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,417
-Good job, fantastic.
-Thanks, Doctor.

144
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,958
It's the third
time in two years.

145
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,708
I've been a psychiatrist in
this hospital for ten years.

146
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,083
Nobody has ever applauded for me.

147
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,125
Doc!

148
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,958
You asked everyone to applaud.

149
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,333
I'm a good person.

150
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,583
Okay, tell me.

151
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,458
What's the secret of your success?

152
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,167
There's no secret to it.

153
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,792
Maybe, I'm just lucky.

154
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,750
-Coffee?
-Sure.

155
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:00,708
Hi, aunt.

156
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm Jenny, and she's Sarah.

157
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,208
We're your neighbors.

158
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,083
Sarah broke your window.

159
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,250
Say sorry.

160
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,875
No! Why should I say sorry?

161
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,333
Say sorry.

162
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,250
-Sorry, aunt.
-It's okay, sweety.

163
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,333
No issues at all.
Please come in.

164
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,792
We're just unpacking.

165
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,833
Mom and Dad, will invite you for
the house warming party next week.

166
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,417
-You should definitely come.
-Yeah, sure.

167
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,083
-Why not?
-Yeah, it'll be great.

168
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,250
Who's this guy?

169
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,750
So cute!

170
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,542
-He's my husband.
-You're married?

171
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,250
Yes.
Why? Don't I look married?

172
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,708
You do.

173
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:43,083
But he doesn't.

174
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Mom!

175
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,250
I'll leave.

176
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,375
Okay, aunt.

177
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,292
We'll meet at the party.

178
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,750
Sarah, come.

179
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,042
-Say bye.
-Bye, aunty.

180
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,167
Bye!

181
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:08,375
<i>A solar eclipse, that</i>
<i>takes place once in 80 years</i>

182
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,375
<i>is expected to</i>
<i>take place next month.</i>

183
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,583
<i>And will be visible from</i>
<i>the north-eastern parts of the country.</i>

184
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:17,083
-Good morning, Dad.
-Good morning, baby.

185
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,958
<i>Meteorologist across the</i>
<i>globe are coming down</i>

186
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,708
<i>to India to conduct a</i>
<i>research on the same.</i>

187
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Where's the knife?

188
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,542
Hopeless!

189
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,417
It's just like singing to a deaf person.

190
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,042
Where's the kitchen knife?

191
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,667
Oh!

192
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,083
I don't know where it is.

193
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,875
Jenny, did you happen to
take the kitchen knife?

194
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,375
Why would I take it?

195
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,875
No matter what goes wrong,
it'll be Jenny's fault.

196
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,250
Dad, I'll wait in the car.

197
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,958
What did I say to
make her upset?

198
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:01,250
Ma'am, the meat has got bad odor.

199
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:02,625
Huh?

200
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:05,167
Meat smell is bad.

201
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,375
Why don't you put it
in the washing machine?

202
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,042
Oh, okay. Washing machine then.

203
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,333
Hey, Neelima!

204
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,375
What did you understand now?

205
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,042
Stop!

206
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,958
One week later, D'costa Residence.

207
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,125
Not at all, you're not late.

208
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,250
-Thanks for inviting.
-Please come.

209
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,125
This is the dining room.

210
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,125
Wow!

211
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,792
What do you say?

212
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,667
-Jenny?
-Dr. Krish, he's our neighbor.

213
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,208
-That's his wife Lakshmi.
-Lakshmi.

214
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:32,792
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

215
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,083
Come, I'll show you around.

216
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,083
I'll be back.

217
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,333
-What's your poison?
-Whiskey, neat.

218
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,292
Neat whiskey is fine for the cold.

219
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,292
But when we were in
Chennai, we used to drink beer.

220
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,958
-Chennai?
-Yeah.

221
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,000
Me too.

222
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,250
So I can take that, you'll be there for a
Chennaite when in need of help, right?

223
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,083
I came with an expectation
to have drinks.

224
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,708
If you're looking for help,
then look for someone else.

225
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,000
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

226
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,000
Wow!

227
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,917
You look so young
in this picture.

228
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,000
Compared to Paul, right?

229
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh no!

230
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,750
I didn't mean that.

231
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,042
It's okay.

232
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,750
Actually...

233
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,958
-I'm his second wife.
-Oh!

234
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,833
Jenny's mother passed
away, seven years ago.

235
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,292
My father had known Paul for a long time.

236
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,500
So...

237
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,417
I said yes.

238
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,292
After which, Sarah
was born to us.

239
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,333
<i>-Baby?</i>
-Lakshmi!

240
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,375
Are you that scared
of your wife?

241
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,000
People who know my wife are
well aware of my fear.

242
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,042
Can you give me back my drink?

243
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,667
Oh! Sorry.

244
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,833
Neat Whiskey.

245
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,042
-Nice.
-Thank you, Jenny.

246
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,875
How do you know my name?

247
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,917
My wife did say that a crazy
person had come home.

248
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,625
Now I know, that the person
isn't crazy but a drunkard.

249
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,542
Actually, I don't like alcohol.

250
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,583
I don't like downers,
only uppers.

251
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,500
You know uppers, right?

252
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,000
Coke, E, MDMA.

253
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:16,917
Oh!

254
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,208
You're teaching a
doctor about drugs?

255
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,750
-Oops!
-If at all I write a prescription

256
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,958
you can get better drugs, legally.

257
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,458
-Really?
-Yeah.

258
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,708
Doctor, I've been unwell
for the past two days.

259
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,375
Can you prescribe something for me?

260
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,917
Sure, I can.

261
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,542
A tight slap!

262
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,000
At least, get me another drink.

263
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,125
Definitely not.

264
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,250
Because Jenny doesn't
like downers.

265
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:53,417
<i>"Crazy bird"</i>

266
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>"Ended up having</i>
<i>Affection for the moon"</i>

267
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,458
<i>"Ended up having</i>

268
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,458
Hi, little girl.

269
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
What are you looking at?

270
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,292
Jenny!

271
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:53,625
Jenny!

272
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,667
Hey, Jenny!

273
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,125
-Paul!
-Huh?

274
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,417
Jenny fell in to the well,
get me a rope. Quick.

275
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,458
What?

276
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,417
<i>Krish! Krish!</i>

277
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,125
<i>Hey, careful!</i>

278
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,833
<i>Paul, do something.</i>

279
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,208
<i>Jenny!</i>

280
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,917
<i>Come soon, make it fast.</i>

281
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,417
<i>Put the rope down.</i>

282
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,875
<i>Krish!</i>

283
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,625
<i>Krish, take the rope!</i>

284
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,333
-Oh God!
-Jenny.

285
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,292
-Oh God!
-Jenny.

286
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,500
Hot water, quick.

287
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:34,500
-Jenny.
-Move aside, move aside.

288
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,708
-Move aside, please.
-Krish.

289
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:36,667
-Give her some space.
-Jenny!

290
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,958
-Don't worry.
-Jenny.

291
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,083
-Relax.
-Yeah.

292
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:44,250
Jenny!

293
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,750
Is she breathing, Krish?
Is she breathing?

294
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:49,958
<i>Jenny, breathe.</i>

295
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:50,958
<i>Just...</i>

296
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,000
<i>Jenny.</i>

297
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,542
She's fine, she's fine. Relax.

298
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,125
Thank God for Krish.

299
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:01,917
-Jenny.
-Get me that blanket.

300
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,042
Are you okay?

301
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,875
Jenny dear, dad's here.

302
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,208
-She's okay. She's okay.
-Dad.

303
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,167
Everyone stood there in silence.

304
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,875
I don't know why
you had to jump.

305
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,250
Sit!

306
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,250
You seemed more concerned
about her than her parents.

307
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,583
You're crazy!

308
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,333
Please remove your shoes.

309
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,417
I almost died.

310
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,333
You will die of pneumonia.

311
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,250
Change your clothes,
I'll get tea.

312
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,333
I wonder...

313
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,333
Krish!

314
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,333
I'm screaming at
the top of my voice.

315
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,833
Are you even listening to me?

316
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,208
What am I saying and
what are you doing?

317
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,333
Let me go.

318
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,042
What If something had
happened to you?

319
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,875
You never listen.

320
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,375
I need you!

321
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,708
What time is it?

322
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,125
It's 3:00 a.m.

323
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,583
Who could it be, at this hour?

324
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:21,667
No idea.

325
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,542
Krish, Jenny's got a seizure.

326
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,958
Can you please come?

327
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,750
<i>Jenny, nothing is wrong with you.</i>

328
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,667
<i>Jenny.</i>

329
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,250
<i>Colonel, please.</i>

330
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,833
Jenny!

331
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,875
-Jenny?
-Hold her legs.

332
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,625
Jenny! Jenny look at me.

333
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:51,208
Please take her inside.

334
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:52,875
<i>What happened to her?</i>

335
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,375
Paul I need a spoon or
anything that could help.

336
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,542
Yeah.

337
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,000
Father, hold her legs.

338
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,833
<i>Jenny!</i>

339
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,792
Krish, here's the spoon.

340
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Open your mouth.

341
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,167
Jenny, open your mouth.

342
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,708
Don't let it go, don't.

343
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:12,375
Hold her tight.

344
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,792
I'm holding her.

345
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:17,250
She'll be okay, you'll be okay.
Jenny, you'll be okay.

346
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:27,792
Baby.

347
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,750
Jenny?

348
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:53,917
Jenny! Jenny!

349
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:00,375
Let go of her legs.

350
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,458
Jenny?

351
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,542
The house warming party
was a grand fete.

352
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,250
All the more reason
for evil eyes.

353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,833
Let her take some rest.

354
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:15,292
Get her to the hospital.
We will run all the required tests.

355
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,083
-Okay, thanks.
-Don't worry.

356
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:18,542
-Thanks a lot.
-Anytime.

357
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:19,625
Goodnight.

358
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,333
Hey!

359
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:31,333
How did this happen?

360
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,500
What?

361
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:33,625
Oh, this.

362
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:35,375
Jenny.

363
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,750
Last night.

364
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,625
Even I've never
bitten you so hard.

365
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,917
No issues.

366
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,250
I'm all yours.

367
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,500
You can bite now.

368
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,583
I'm going to shoot
your maid dead.

369
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,542
You...

370
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:56,833
Hi, Krish.

371
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:00,792
Thank you for what you
did for me, last night.

372
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,000
Hey! It's okay, Jenny.

373
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:06,125
If you don't mind.

374
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:09,875
I'll see you at the hospital.

375
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,833
<i>Bye, aunt.</i>

376
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,042
Hi, Krish...

377
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,333
bye, aunt.

378
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,583
It's getting out of control.

379
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:20,708
Hey.

380
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:21,667
She's just a kid.

381
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,875
-Get lost.
-Hey, Lakshmi!

382
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,333
Just as I expected, Paul.

383
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:40,875
Everything is normal.

384
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,208
Fits, can sometimes occur
without any reason.

385
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,958
Not to worry.

386
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,500
Physically, Jenny is 100 percent fine.

387
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:49,750
-Thank you, Krish.
-Anytime.

388
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:50,667
Thank you.

389
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,125
-Bye.
-Bye.

390
00:26:58,625 --> 00:26:59,750
Kitchen knife?

391
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,625
Earlier, she lied to me.

392
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:04,625
But she has kept it here.

393
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,375
What's wrong with this girl?

394
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,292
Ouch!

395
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,833
Get out of here.

396
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,625
Hello?

397
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:56,917
Lizzie?

398
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,250
Hey, Lakshmi!

399
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,125
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

400
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,583
I think your doorbell isn't working.

401
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,250
That's why I came in looking for you.

402
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,875
-Really? I'll get it fixed.
-Okay.

403
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,583
I came down to invite
you guys for dinner.

404
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:26,292
Don't worry,
I can cook really well.

405
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,875
Good.

406
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,333
We'll be there for sure.

407
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,417
But I'll speak to Paul
and confirm with you.

408
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,625
No problem.

409
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:35,583
Great.

410
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,083
The bell fixed itself.

411
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:02,833
What happened?

412
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,125
Nothing.

413
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,083
Okay, I'll leave now.
I will see you tonight for dinner.

414
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:08,250
Oh!

415
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,500
I got this chocolate for Sarah.

416
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,875
Sarah and Jenny are at the
site with my husband.

417
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,125
-Is that so?
-Yes.

418
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,833
My work gets easier when
the kids are not around.

419
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,458
<i>-Would you like some tea?</i>
-No, thanks.

420
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,000
<i>We had ordered 3 propeller</i>
<i>turbines for our new MHP.</i>

421
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,875
<i>-What's the status on that?</i>
<i>-It'll be here in the evening.</i>

422
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,708
We can start the installation
process by tomorrow.

423
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,417
-Okay, thank you. Thanks.
-Sure, sir.

424
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:43,750
Yeah, Lizzie.

425
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,000
Lakshmi has invited us
for dinner tonight.

426
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,125
<i>I didn't check with</i>
<i>you and agreed to it.</i>

427
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,208
<i>No problem, right?</i>

428
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,667
Yes, sure.

429
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,458
I hope the kids are
not disturbing you.

430
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,500
No, not at all.

431
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,292
-Okay, see you.
<i>-Okay.</i>

432
00:29:58,458 --> 00:29:59,708
-Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

433
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,167
Hey, Jenny, be careful.

434
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:03,583
Yes, Dad.

435
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,542
May I have your attention?

436
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,083
Glasses please.

437
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,167
-Cheers guys!
-Cheers!

438
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,083
Welcome to the Himalayas.

439
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,417
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

440
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,125
-Hope it's not too spicy.
-Not at all.

441
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,542
Everything is perfect.

442
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:24,500
Why didn't Sarah come?
I got pastry for her.

443
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,542
Sarah went early to bed.

444
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,458
-Oh.
-So, Colonel stayed back with her.

445
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,042
<i>So that makes Sarah,</i>
<i>grandad's pet.</i>

446
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:33,042
<i>Absolutely, best friends.</i>
<i>Moreover, they're roommates.</i>

447
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,000
<i>-I forgot to ask</i>
<i>-Yes?</i>

448
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,667
<i>Are her school admission</i>
<i>formalities done?</i>

449
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,375
<i>I had spoken to the principal of</i>
<i>St. Mary's school, yesterday.</i>

450
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,958
<i>He assured that it</i>
<i>should be done.</i>

451
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,042
<i>Moreover, there's enough time</i>
<i>for the schools to start.</i>

452
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,125
-Paul!
-Huh?

453
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,042
Tell me.

454
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,167
What made you choose this house?

455
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,750
I always desired to
own a big house.

456
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,625
My dream home!

457
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,458
It was in my budget
at the right time.

458
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,042
<i>Timing is everything.</i>

459
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,375
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

460
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,083
<i>Timing!</i>

461
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,333
Jenny, what are you doing?

462
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:09,958
I didn't do anything.

463
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,917
You don't seem to eat well.

464
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,750
She's pecking liking a bird.

465
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,000
<i>She does the same</i>
<i>at home as well.</i>

466
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,083
<i>-She's playful all the time.</i>
-Please, excuse me.

467
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,917
-<i>Sure. Sure.</i>
<i>-Jenny come on eat your food.</i>

468
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,167
Don't be shy.

469
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,833
<i>You eat such delicious food everyday?</i>

470
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,500
<i>How do you stay in shape, Krish?</i>

471
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,583
<i>If I ask for such food daily,</i>
<i>I'll get thrashed.</i>

472
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,792
<i>It's been specially made for you guys.</i>

473
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:28,792
<i>Oh!</i>

474
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,833
<i>Did you hear what</i>
<i>he said about you?</i>

475
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,083
-Would you like some?
<i>-Yeah, please.</i>

476
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:41,125
-No, no, no. I'm full.
-Just one more spoon.

477
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,042
Thank you. Thanks.

478
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,833
<i>You don't have to,</i>
<i>I'll clear the table.</i>

479
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:47,708
<i>It's okay, I don't mind.</i>

480
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,458
How's the Power Plant
Project coming through?

481
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,250
Not bad at all.

482
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,375
We've got the permission
for the second one.

483
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,292
Installation will
start tomorrow.

484
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,292
That's great.

485
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,917
Get done as much you can, before winter.

486
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,125
Last year, the roads were closed for
2 weeks due to heavy snowfall.

487
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:04,000
-Oh!
-I couldn't go to the hospital.

488
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,083
-Is it that bad?
-Yeah.

489
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,500
Jenny!
What happened?

490
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,958
-Dad!
-What happened?

491
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,375
-Lizzie!
-Dad!

492
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,542
-What happened, Jenny?
-Jenny there's nothing.

493
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,625
There's nothing.

494
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,167
Why don't come here?

495
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,208
Why don't you look for yourself?

496
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:43,167
What happened?

497
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,000
There's nothing, dear.
There's nothing.

498
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,167
I think she saw something.

499
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,667
There's nothing.

500
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:54,250
-Dad, I really did see something.
-Jenny!

501
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,292
I'm sorry, Krish.

502
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,625
I'll see you tomorrow.

503
00:32:58,708 --> 00:32:59,667
It's fine, no issues.

504
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,292
Goodnight.

505
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,750
I wonder what she saw.

506
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:34,583
Paul.

507
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,292
What's the time?

508
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,083
What's your dad upto?

509
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:41,958
Dad!

510
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:48,708
<i>Dad!</i>

511
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,833
Jenny?

512
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,917
Even I heard it, Dad.

513
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,625
You won't hear it anymore.

514
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:58,667
Go to bed.

515
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,583
Ma'am, is this your phone?

516
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,458
-Huh? No.
-Show me.

517
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,000
This is Jenny's phone.

518
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,375
You seem to know everything.

519
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,042
Give that to me.

520
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:38,542
I'll send it across through the maid.

521
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:39,792
You can leave for work.

522
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,083
It's next door.
I'll drop it on the way.

523
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,000
Why?

524
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,417
Aren't you satisfied with what
happened under the table, last night?

525
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,333
Hey!

526
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,000
She's just a kid.
Have some shame.

527
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,417
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

528
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,458
Then give me the phone.

529
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,875
-Why?
-Give it to me.

530
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,458
-I said, I will drop it.
-Give me the phone.

531
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,292
-Krish!
-Hey, what are you doing? Let me go.

532
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:57,042
-Give it to me.
-Wait, it's ringing.

533
00:36:58,167 --> 00:36:59,083
Hello?

534
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,125
Hey, Paul.

535
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,167
Krish here.

536
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:04,917
Jenny forgot her phone here, last night.

537
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,583
What?

538
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,083
Are you sure,
she is not at home?

539
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,167
Okay, I'll be right there.

540
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,583
Jenny and Sarah are
missing since morning.

541
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,417
Let me go and check.

542
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,250
Jenny!

543
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,583
Jenny!

544
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,750
I'm coming too.
Where are you going?

545
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:39,333
Jenny.

546
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,667
She comes here quite often.

547
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:48,083
You're well aware of what
happened last night.

548
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,792
I'm really worried.

549
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,208
Paul, it's a difficult age.

550
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,167
Don't confuse yourself...

551
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,750
Jenny.

552
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,208
<i>Krish, go fetch Sarah.</i>
<i>I'll follow Jenny.</i>

553
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,250
Jenny, stop!

554
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,542
Jenny!

555
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,333
Jenny!

556
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,208
Jenny.

557
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,792
Sarah, be careful.

558
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:34,708
Jenny!

559
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:35,875
Help!

560
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,292
Sarah.

561
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,125
Jenny!

562
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,833
Jenny!

563
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,542
Jenny!

564
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:03,708
<i>Jenny!</i>

565
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,333
Help!

566
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,542
Jenny?

567
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:43,708
Come here.

568
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,167
Jenny.

569
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,833
I was following her...

570
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:11,208
and I fell down.

571
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,625
-My hands are hurting.
-Jenny!

572
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,875
Why did you go there?

573
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,875
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

574
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,625
<i>Why did you go there?</i>

575
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:24,958
Open your mouth and
say something.

576
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,375
-Paul.
-Let me deal with this, Dad.

577
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,583
Jenny?

578
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:30,958
-Jenny!
-Jenny.

579
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,000
-Jenny.
-Jenny.

580
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,375
Jenny?

581
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,625
-Do you know what's happening?
-Jenny?

582
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:36,708
Is she alright?

583
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:37,708
-Jenny.
-Jenny.

584
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:39,458
Lay her down.

585
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:41,958
Jenny, can you hear me?

586
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:43,125
Dad.

587
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,208
She's fine.

588
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,417
What's happening to her?

589
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,833
Huh?

590
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,083
This is Mr. Paul and his
daughter, Jennifer.

591
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:58,125
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

592
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Sure, you guys wait in my cabin.

593
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,500
-I'll call you later.
-Sure.

594
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:04,667
Paul.

595
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,625
Dad?

596
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,583
I'll be outside.

597
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,375
Hi.

598
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,208
Hi.

599
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:23,333
This is a safe zone.

600
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,250
Okay?

601
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:26,542
You can speak your mind here.

602
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,083
No one will judge you.

603
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:32,750
Whatever we discuss here,
will remain between us.

604
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:35,375
Patient-Doctor Confidentiality.

605
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,083
Understood?

606
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,042
Okay.

607
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,542
Now tell me.

608
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:46,083
What's the problem?

609
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,625
She's telling us to
leave the house.

610
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,333
Who?

611
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:16,750
Home.

612
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:28,958
Hello.

613
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,833
Hello.

614
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:13,042
Sarah, don't play pranks on me.

615
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,875
<i>Get out of here.</i>

616
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:39,583
It means...

617
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:42,208
"Get out of here."

618
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,083
In Chinese.

619
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,083
Do you know Chinese?

620
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,208
No.

621
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:51,250
I checked it on
Google Translate.

622
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,833
Were there any other incidences?

623
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,375
<i>Last Friday...</i>

624
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,208
<i>Friday, the 13th!</i>

625
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:09,417
<i>It was around 2:00 a.m.</i>
<i>in the night.</i>

626
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,125
Hey, Sarah.

627
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,583
I'm in here.

628
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,125
Sarah, didn't you hear
that I'm in here?

629
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,208
Just wait and watch,
what I'm going to do.

630
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,792
<i>Did you mention this at home?</i>

631
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,083
<i>No.</i>

632
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,958
<i>I didn't, as no one</i>
<i>would've believed me.</i>

633
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,917
<i>Was there someone else with you?</i>

634
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:52,875
No.

635
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,250
Apart from you, did anyone
else experience something?

636
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:58,167
I'm not sure.

637
00:45:58,625 --> 00:45:59,583
So...

638
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:01,792
it was just you, who
has seen all of this?

639
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,833
Today's session is over.

640
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,708
Ask you father to come in.

641
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,417
You can you wait
outside for sometime.

642
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:16,792
Don't worry.

643
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,125
Everything is alright.

644
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:20,292
I won't share anything
with your father.

645
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:21,458
Okay?

646
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,083
Okay.

647
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,958
Did you experience
anything strange at home?

648
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:46,208
Yeah, one night, my father's
Dictaphone started playing.

649
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:50,292
I went and switched it off, but
it started to play again.

650
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:51,917
So, I removed the batteries.

651
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,500
Why do you think it happened?

652
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:58,875
Perhaps, the play button
was broken.

653
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,708
Correct.

654
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,833
And if at all Jenny
was present there

655
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:05,167
she would've made up
something out of it.

656
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,583
-What do you mean?
-Well...

657
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,458
Only after I get to have
more sessions with Jenny

658
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,292
I would be able to
diagnose her properly.

659
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:24,917
Albert Einstein quotes, "Energy can
neither be created nor destroyed."

660
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,458
Energy is everywhere.

661
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:33,042
So, when a human being dies
where does the soul go?

662
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:36,458
I've been in search of
that answer for ages.

663
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:39,667
Since when is this
happening in the house?

664
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,667
I think--

665
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,875
Since I come house.

666
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:44,333
One month.

667
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,792
Colonel Sir,
Jenny.

668
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:49,500
Come here, kid.

669
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:51,500
Come here, dear.

670
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:52,417
Jenny.

671
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:53,833
Go to your room.

672
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,208
Jenny!

673
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,375
You are?

674
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:07,417
I'm a nomad.

675
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,208
Colonel said, there are strange
things happening in the house.

676
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,125
And you don't have
any answer to that.

677
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:16,208
That's why, I'm here.

678
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,583
We're not looking
for any answers.

679
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,500
Please leave.

680
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:21,500
Thank you!

681
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,000
Thanks.

682
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,208
I was just trying to help.

683
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:29,667
Jenny?

684
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:37,375
Jenny?

685
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:44,292
It's late.

686
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:46,958
Go to bed.

687
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:48,625
Come on.

688
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:16,958
Doctor Prasad?

689
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,583
As per your instructions,
I'm taking Jenny out.

690
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,875
I'll come back, once
you give me a call.

691
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,000
Yes.

692
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,417

You haven't left yet?

707
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,125
Hey, Doc. Five minutes.

708
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:28,667
How was the morning
session with Jenny?

709
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,833
It went well but it's taking time.

710
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,125
If it's taking too much
time, send her to the OT.

711
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,375
I will rewire her brain and
she'll be alright in two days.

712
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:37,750
-Goodnight doctors.
-Goodnight.

713
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:39,667
I'm trying to do this my way.

714
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:41,750
Hypnotherapy starting
from tomorrow.

715
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,083
Hypnotherapy?

716
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:45,542
Is it the one where you
use a clock and show magic?

717
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:47,125
Exactly.

718
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,333
Can I come and watch?

719
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:50,083
-Sure, why not?
-Superb.

720
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,042
-Can you drop me.
-Sure, Doc.

721
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,333
One for the road?

722
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:54,958
If I drink and drive

723
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:56,500
my wife will thrash me.

724
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:57,792
Can I come and watch?

725
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm a doctor, I can see everything.

726
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:01,958
-Just one drink.
-You want me to get beaten up, don't you?

727
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:15,708
Hi, baby.

728
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,708
Paul was saying that he needs help.

729
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:18,917
I'll go check on that.

730
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,542
Can you get me a cup of tea?

731
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:29,625
Krish.

732
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,417
I have a doubt.

733
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,292
Is this our home,
or the one next door?

734
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:38,875
I sleep here every night.

735
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:40,750
So, I think, this is our house.

736
00:53:42,792 --> 00:53:43,625
Hey.

737
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,250
I understand that they are
facing issues in that house.

738
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:49,708
But whether they live, move

739
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:51,542
or perhaps shove off from here

740
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:53,542
is something that Paul
will take care of.

741
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,583
Why don't you just
mind your own business?

742
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,292
Are you asking me to abandon Jenny?

743
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,792
You mentioned that
girl's name again.

744
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,417
I'm a doctor and
she's my patient.

745
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,583
That's it.

746
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:05,958
If you don't get it, then
that's your problem.

747
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,750
I'll take care of her,
until she's fine.

748
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:09,875
That's about it.

749
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:20,208
20th February, 2016.
Hypnotherapy Session 1.

750
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:23,833
Shall we begin?

751
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,583
Jenny.

752
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,375
Close your eyes.

753
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,750
Take a deep breath.

754
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:33,417
Focus on the darkness.

755
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:38,667
Be attentive to this ticking sound.

756
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,250
You'd feel sleepy now.

757
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:43,958
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

758
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,833
<i>Just relax.</i>

759
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:50,958
When I...

760
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:53,875
snap my fingers like this.

761
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,208
You'll have to answer
my questions.

762
00:54:57,625 --> 00:54:58,458
Okay?

763
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:00,833
Once again

764
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:03,583
when I snap my fingers,
you'll have to wake up.

765
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,083
Think of it as an
'On' and 'Off' switch.

766
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,292
<i>And follow the same.</i>

767
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:17,000
Jenny.

768
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,750
Don't you like this place?

769
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Do you wish to go back
to your old house?

770
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,667
Initially, I never
used to like it here.

771
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:36,375
But later, Dad convinced
me to live here.

772
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,542
Now I like it here.

773
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,542
And there's Krish who
lives next door.

774
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,708
This cold weather...

775
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,625
now I like everything.

776
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:49,292
If you like everything here...

777
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,875
then why did you go to that
mountain the other day?

778
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,375
I didn't go.

779
00:55:58,042 --> 00:56:00,958
<i>Why did you go to that mountain</i>
<i>and had everyone scared?</i>

780
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,208
I'm telling you,
I didn't go.

781
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,375
So can I talk to the
one who went up there?

782
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:19,000
Why are you quiet?

783
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,875
I'm talking to you, tell me.

784
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:38,625
This is my house.

785
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:42,208
Jenny?

786
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:46,583
No one can live hear.

787
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,250
She's said, "This is my house."

788
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:50,292
"No one else can live here."

789
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:52,708
Who are you to say this?

790
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:57,542
Li-Jing.

791
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:58,875
It's her name.

792
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:15,958
Jenny?

793
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:20,708
What are you doing?

794
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:22,542
What are you doing?

795
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:26,667
I am wiping the blood on my stomach.

796
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:30,667
She said, "Wiping the blood
stains on my stomach."

797
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:33,750
Jenny?

798
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:42,292
Jenny?

799
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:00,708
Jenny?

800
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:02,583
Doctor!

801
00:58:03,042 --> 00:58:04,042
Jenny!

802
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,208
Jenny!

803
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:07,875
Jenny!

804
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:10,958
Listen to me, relax!

805
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,042
Jenny?

806
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,333
Wake up, Jenny.

807
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,333
What did I say?

808
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:37,292
What happened, Dad?

809
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:48,875
Do you have a family priest?

810
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:50,375
Priest?

811
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:52,833
-For what?
-I'll let you know.

812
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:54,917
We're Pentecostal Christians.

813
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:57,667
We have Pastor Joshua
at the local church.

814
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,583
In order to save Jenny...

815
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:03,333
we would need his help.

816
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:13,958
<i>Earth to earth.</i>

817
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,375
<i>Ashes to ashes.</i>

818
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:18,417
<i>Dust to dust.</i>

819
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:26,167
<i>In sure and certain</i>
<i>hope of resurrection.</i>

820
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:30,792
<i>And lastly, in to your</i>
<i>hands, Oh merciful savior.</i>

821
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,708
<i>We commend, your servant.</i>

822
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:34,958
<i>And we commit the body</i>
<i>to the ground.</i>

823
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:38,917
<i>Blessed, peace of</i>
<i>everlasting rest.</i>

824
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,458
<i>In the...</i>

825
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:42,250
<i>In the company of</i>

826
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,042
<i>the glorious company of</i>
<i>Saints of Light.</i>

827
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,167
<i>Amen.</i>

828
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:50,625
We always offer blessings.

829
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,083
But today, Dr. Prasad
has come to meet me.

830
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,542
What can I do for you?

831
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:58,750
We need you to perform an exorcism
on Paul's daughter, Jenny.

832
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:00,083
Exorcism?

833
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:02,958
Our child is possessed?

834
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,167
I'm a professional psychiatrist.

835
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:06,875
Jenny is most definitely
not possessed.

836
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,458
Then why do you need me?

837
01:00:08,792 --> 01:00:10,583
Actually, she's been quite
unhappy these days.

838
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:14,250
She still hasn't come out
of the trauma her mother's demise.

839
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:17,125
She started to develop
some stories of her own.

840
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:22,750
And now she believes that those
imaginary stories are real.

841
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,750
She's feeling very
lonely out here.

842
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,083
She doesn't know how
to deal with this.

843
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:31,250
She believes that
Li-Jing's ghost has possessed her.

844
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,708
If you ask, why Li-Jing?

845
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:34,417
<i>She must have read a</i>
<i>book of this sort.</i>

846
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,708
<i>She might have watched a film</i>
<i>Or it must be the internet.</i>

847
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,500
<i>Or, she must have started this</i>
<i>to drive away boredom.</i>

848
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,000
<i>Now she strongly</i>
<i>believes that Li-Jing</i>

849
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:42,583
is bound to send everyone
away from this house.

850
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:43,667
Hold on a second, Doc.

851
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,500
We both heard it clearly.

852
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,625
She was speaking Chinese.

853
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,708
<i>I checked it on</i>
<i>Google Translate.</i>

854
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,292
Google Translate.

855
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,417
She's fooling herself.

856
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:57,750
Classic psychosomatic behavior.

857
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:03,042
That's why we'll have to perform a
fake exorcism and get done with it.

858
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,750
But, doctor, isn't there a medical
treatment for this issue?

859
01:01:05,917 --> 01:01:08,250
This fake exorcism is a
treatment by itself, Paul.

860
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:11,208
Only then, Jenny will believe
that Li-Jing's soul has left her body.

861
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:15,125
I'll follow the procedure of an exorcism.

862
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:18,042
You may call it a treatment...

863
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,750
or a deception.

864
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:21,625
We...

865
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:23,750
will take this as a blessing.

866
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:24,792
Don't worry.

867
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:26,667
Our child will be alright.

868
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:33,708
This plan, Jenny's exorcism...

869
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,250
I just don't get it.

870
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,375
Whatever we're doing
is for Jenny's good.

871
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,250
Dr. Prasad.

872
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:42,375
Psychiatrist.

873
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:43,708
Man of Science.

874
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:46,458
What you're doing doesn't
match your profession.

875
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,167
Brain surgeon!

876
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:51,083
You cut open the human brain
and massage it.

877
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:53,125
And you doubt my techniques?

878
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,292
I sure do, Doc.

879
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,167
We're going to perform
a fake exorcism, right?

880
01:02:57,292 --> 01:02:59,917
-Yup!
-Then why do we need a real Pastor?

881
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:01,292
It's for Jenny, Krish.

882
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:02,750
She's got to believe it.

883
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:04,583
Even if the believer is a fool...

884
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,375
his beliefs are
everything to him.

885
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,375
Different rules for
different fools.

886
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:17,250
-Good morning, doctors.
-Morning!

887
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:23,083
My mother would always say...

888
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,125
if you need to light a lamp

889
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:26,292
all you need is oil.

890
01:03:27,042 --> 01:03:28,542
But if you're looking for light...

891
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,167
you need faith.

892
01:03:30,917 --> 01:03:31,917
Faith!

893
01:03:32,917 --> 01:03:33,750
Shall we?

894
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:38,958
Everything will be fine.

895
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,917
Lizzie, please. You stay back.

896
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:44,458
-Colonel, please take care of her.
-Okay, Doctor.

897
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:45,875
-Paul.
-Sit down.

898
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:48,708
-Are we ready?
-Yeah.

899
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:50,708
Please.

900
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:57,792
22nd February, 2016.
The exorcism of Jenny D'costa.

901
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,917
<i>Dad, who's this?</i>

902
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,917
We've never met.

903
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:20,208
I'm Pastor Joshua.

904
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:22,625
How are you, Jennifer?

905
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:24,000
<i>Jennifer?</i>

906
01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:26,542
Everyone calls me Jenny.

907
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:27,792
Jenny.

908
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:29,917
Why am I surrounded
by so many people?

909
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:31,500
I'm scared.

910
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,750
It was that room the other day and
today it's this room, that's it.

911
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:35,917
Okay?

912
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,333
Okay.

913
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,750
What are you going to do?

914
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,292
You were wiping blood of
your stomach that day.

915
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:43,250
Whose blood was it?

916
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,667
Who is it that you had killed?

917
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:46,875
What are you saying, Doctor?

918
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,417
I don't understand.

919
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:49,958
I'm not talking to you, Jenny.

920
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:51,417
Li-Jing.

921
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,042
If you don't talk to us

922
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,625
Pastor Joshua will make
sure to chase you away.

923
01:04:56,708 --> 01:05:01,417
Then you will not be able to
use Jenny for your advantage.

924
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,917
-Jenny?
-Paul.

925
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:42,708
Don't be scared.

926
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:07,000
I did not kill anyone.

927
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,167
Start the procedure please.

928
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:15,042
Lord, the Father in heaven.

929
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:16,750
Lord, the Father in heaven.

930
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:18,875
Lord the Father in heaven,
the most merciful.

931
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,208
<i>Bless us.</i>

932
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:21,500
<i>Have mercy upon us.</i>

933
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:22,667
Oh, wicked spirit.

934
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,958
Release this gentle
soul unto our Lord.

935
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:27,875
<i>Behold the cross of the Lord.</i>

936
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:30,958
<i>Flee bands of enemies,</i>
<i>we drive you from us.</i>

937
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:34,167
Whoever you may be,
unclean spirits.

938
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:39,375
In the name of Jesus Christ,
our God and Lord.

939
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:44,542
<i>We confidently undertake to repulse, the</i>
<i>attacks and deseeds of the devil.</i>

940
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,792
<i>The Lord's enemies are</i>
<i>scattered and driven away.</i>

941
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:50,000
All Satanic powers.

942
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,667
Pastor, do something.

943
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:54,125
She's not your Jenny.

944
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,917
There's something else inside of her.

945
01:06:58,667 --> 01:07:02,208
Here on, saving Jenny,
is my responsibility.

946
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:05,083
All infernal invaders.

947
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:09,083
<i>All wicked legions, all assemblies...</i>

948
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,667
<i>God arises,</i>
<i>his enemies are scattered.</i>

949
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,125
<i>And those who hate him, flee before him.</i>

950
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,292
<i>As wax melts before fire</i>

951
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:24,000
<i>so the wicked perish at</i>
<i>the presence of God.</i>

952
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,125
All wicked legions.

953
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:30,208
Dr. Prasad,
get me a rope, right away.

954
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:32,333
Dr. Prasad!

955
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:34,000
Krish!

956
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:40,667
God arises,
his enemies are scattered.

957
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,458
<i>And those who hate him, flee before him.</i>

958
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:45,750
<i>The smoke is driven away.</i>

959
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:48,500
<i>As wax melts before the fire</i>

960
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:51,542
<i>so the wicked perish at</i>
<i>the presence of God.</i>

961
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:55,583
<i>-Behold the cross of the Lord.</i>
-Doc!

962
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,833
<i>-Flee bands of enemies.</i>
-Doc!

963
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:01,167
<i>-The lion of the tribe of Judah</i>
-Doc, help me.

964
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,208
<i>-the offspring of David hath conquered.</i>
-Doc!

965
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:07,583
<i>May thy mercy, Lord descend upon us.</i>

966
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,292
<i>As great as our hope, in thee</i>

967
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:11,333
<i>we're driven.</i>

968
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:14,333
<i>Dr. Prasad!</i>
<i>Dr. Prasad!</i>

969
01:08:14,417 --> 01:08:15,708
No!

970
01:08:21,542 --> 01:08:23,417
Krish!
Come on, Krish.

971
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,875
-Come on.
-I command you, unclean spirit.

972
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:27,208
-Whoever you are
-Hold her.

973
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:30,375
<i>along with all your</i>
<i>minions now attacking this servant of God.</i>

974
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,792
Doc, hold her.

975
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:36,750
God, the Father of our
lord Jesus Christ.

976
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:41,333
Heed my prayer, may
the Lord be with you.

977
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,917
-I adjourn you, Ancient Serpent
-Hold her.

978
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,833
unto our Lord.

979
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,833
In the name of our Lord and God...

980
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:54,167
<i>I adjourn you to depart</i>
<i>forthwith in fear</i>

981
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:57,292
<i>from this servant of God.</i>

982
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,917
I adjourn you, Ancient Spirit

983
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,417
by the judge of the
living and of the dead.

984
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:21,625
Depart forthwith from
this servant of God.

985
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:25,542
Behold this, the
cross of our Lord.

986
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:28,875
We drive you from us,
whoever you may be

987
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:32,333
<i>all wicked legions,</i>
<i>assemblies and sects.</i>

988
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:34,625
In the name and by the power of...

989
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,292
The girl will die.

990
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:16,375
Jennifer?

991
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,458
Jennifer?

992
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,958
Everyone calls me Jenny.

993
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:28,500
Dad?

994
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:31,167
Jenny!

995
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:07,333
God is good.

996
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:22,292
Oh Lord, have mercy.

997
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:44,000
Krish.

998
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:46,625
Come on, Krish.

999
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,083
Krish!

1000
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:50,583
Come on, get up.

1001
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:51,500
Jenny?

1002
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:53,458
Jenny, are you okay?

1003
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,333
You alright?

1004
01:11:58,667 --> 01:11:59,500
Pastor?

1005
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,167
He's alive.

1006
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,792
<i>The girl will die.</i>

1007
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:19,333
<i>The girl will die.</i>

1008
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,000
March, 2016.
Silent Hill Hospital.

1009
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,042
Vitals are stable.

1010
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:35,542
Pulse is consistent.

1011
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,208
Change the dressing tomorrow.

1012
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:38,708
And monitor him every two hours.

1013
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:39,625
Okay?

1014
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:41,167
Um...

1015
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,208
Doctor, if any special treatment
or surgery is required

1016
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,500
please go ahead.

1017
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,958
You don't have to
worry about the cost.

1018
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,708
As I said...

1019
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:53,958
we can't perform a surgery
until he's out of the coma.

1020
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,500
Nurse, once you've filed the
reports, go to your ward.

1021
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,625
-I'll see you there.
-Okay, Doctor.

1022
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:02,917
We need your touch.

1023
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,333
We wait on you.

1024
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:06,125
You're our savior.

1025
01:13:06,292 --> 01:13:07,167
Our friend...

1026
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,250
and our hope.

1027
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:09,375
Amen.

1028
01:13:14,292 --> 01:13:15,958
They've been praying
for him relentlessly.

1029
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,125
They can at least pray for him.

1030
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,000
What do I do?

1031
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:24,125
For my guilty conscience.

1032
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,708
I keep asking myself, "Why did
I get him involved in this?"

1033
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:29,333
This question has been
pricking me every moment.

1034
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,750
<i>We have the same</i>
<i>guilty conscience.</i>

1035
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,583
It all happened for the
sake of my daughter.

1036
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:36,042
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1037
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:37,625
How's everyone at home?

1038
01:13:38,042 --> 01:13:39,875
Jenny seems absolutely normal.

1039
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,667
I'll check on Pastor
and then leave.

1040
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:53,167
Krish.

1041
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:55,792
That day, when I saw
Pastor Joshua for the last time

1042
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:58,167
I saw a strange fear in his eyes.

1043
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,625
Did you notice that?

1044
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:00,875
I didn't.

1045
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I have a feeling that there's something
more to this incident, Krish.

1046
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:05,417
Doc...

1047
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:08,417
didn't Paul just say
that Jenny is normal now?

1048
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:09,625
Correct.

1049
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,583
But do we know everything
that we are supposed to?

1050
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:15,625
Up until we ask the right question,
we won't get the right answer.

1051
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:18,583
But only Pastor Joshua
has the right answer.

1052
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:22,667
<i>Krish, we can't wait until</i>
<i>he regains consciousness.</i>

1053
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,708
That means, you're not going to
stop until you get all the answers.

1054
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:29,208
Tell me, what you want to do?

1055
01:14:29,417 --> 01:14:30,333
I'm with you.

1056
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:35,583
<i>Paul!</i>

1057
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:36,875
Yeah?

1058
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,000
Everyone's gathered at one place?

1059
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:47,208
We need to talk, Paul.

1060
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:53,750
-Yeah.
-After everything that happened...

1061
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,292
is it vital for us to be in this house?

1062
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,625
<i>Let's go away, please.</i>

1063
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,917
<i>Yes, Paul.</i>

1064
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,542
Yes, Lizzie is right.
We should leave from this house.

1065
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,750
I've pawned this house as collateral
for the loan for the Power Plant Project.

1066
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:12,333
If they come down for inspection
and find this house locked

1067
01:15:12,417 --> 01:15:13,708
the loan application
would be canceled.

1068
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:16,125
Mom, I had told you
that he'll get upset.

1069
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,000
Why are you guys still scared?

1070
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:19,458
We can stay in this house.

1071
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,583
<i>I'm absolutely fine now.</i>

1072
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,333
Please stop torturing
Dad with this.

1073
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,333
Please.

1074
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:28,125
<i>Dad...</i>

1075
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:33,458
whatever happens,
will happen for good.

1076
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:53,917
Just give another chance
to me and to this house.

1077
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:56,500
Please.

1078
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:15,083
<i>'I pray to Lord Brahma,</i>
<i>Murari and Tripurantakari.'</i>

1079
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:17,542
<i>'The Sun, the Moon,</i>
<i>Mars and Mercury...'</i>

1080
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,667
<i>'I pray to Lord Brahma,</i>
<i>Murari and Tripurantakari.'</i>

1081
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:26,167
<i>'The Sun, the Moon, Mars and Mercury.'</i>

01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:28,625
<i>'Jupiter, Venus, Saturn...'</i>

1083
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,208
Sir!

1084
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:32,167
What are you doing?

1085
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:33,292
Sir!

1086
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:34,625
Every time...

1087
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,333
things missing, Sir.

1088
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:38,125
Knife missing...

1089
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:40,708
bad smell.

1090
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:42,667
Fridge, Sir.

1091
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:45,125
Ghost in...

1092
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,625
house, Sir.

1093
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,125
I do prayer.

1094
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,667
Don't scare everyone at the
house with this nonsense.

1095
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,625
Every time...

1096
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,083
meaning.

1097
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:58,375
Sir, every different
meaning, sir.

1098
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:00,208
Not good for family.

1099
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:01,667
Hey, stop it!

1100
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:04,167
Don't do this nonsense...

1101
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,042
Don't do this in front of the kids.

1102
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:08,750
Got it?

1103
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,958
-Understood?
<i>-Okay, sir.</i>

1104
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:12,667
Go to bed.

1105
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,208
If I catch you doing this again...

1106
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:16,917
you won't be spared.

1107
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:45,958
-Lakshmi!?
<i>-Oh my God! Oh my God!</i>

1108
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:47,208
What happened?

1109
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:49,750
Krish, do you see this strip?

1110
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:52,417
If you see two lines on this,
it means that I'm pregnant.

1111
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:55,542
There are two lines
and I'm pregnant.

1112
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,500
You do realize that
I'm a doctor, right?

1113
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,042
I love you!

1114
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:10,458
Who's the father?

1115
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:14,583
I love you too!

1116
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,000
It's your agency
who had sent her.

1117
01:20:18,542 --> 01:20:20,458
If the agency itself doesn't
know, then who does?

1118
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,500
You find out and let us know.

1119
01:20:24,292 --> 01:20:25,125
Thank you.

1120
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,792
-Nonsense.
<i>-She's crazy.</i>

1121
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:29,833
<i>She left without even</i>
<i>taking her stuff.</i>

1122
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,458
<i>Wonder what was the emergency.</i>

1123
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:35,208
Paul, I think you
should try and call--

1124
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,333
Paul?

1125
01:21:08,542 --> 01:21:09,875
<i>Ghost in...</i>

1126
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,500
<i>house, Sir.</i>

1127
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:14,208
<i>I do prayer.</i>

1128
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:15,792
Dad.

1129
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:18,125
please call the psychic.

1130
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,000
Right now.

1131
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,042
Everyone has their own way
to talk to the spirits.

1132
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:27,792
Some roll the dice to
talk to the spirits...

1133
01:21:28,292 --> 01:21:30,083
while some use pen and paper.

1134
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:34,500
It was through sand art, when
a spirit first spoke to me.

1135
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,125
<i>They communicate...</i>

1136
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,542
<i>through the sand.</i>

1137
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:40,750
This is Mr. Chang.

1138
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:42,083
Chinese translator.

1139
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:44,125
He was very helpful
during Jenny's hypnosis.

1140
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:45,208
That's why, I called him.

1141
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:51,708
<i>'Devotion to the mystic</i>
<i>law of the Lotus Sutra.'</i>

1142
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,667
Is there someone in this house?

1143
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:09,208
Is there anybody in this house?

1144
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:26,500
Dad!

1145
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
She's here.

1146
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:36,375
You can speak to
them through me.

1147
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:38,167
I'll let them know.

1148
01:22:39,292 --> 01:22:43,667
You can speak to
them through me.

1149
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:47,250
I'll let them know.

1150
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:14,750
There are two spirits.

1151
01:23:15,292 --> 01:23:17,750
It's the spirits of a
mother and her daughter.

1152
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:32,958
Get out of here.

1153
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:41,917
Everyone will be killed.

1154
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:50,583
Everyone will be killed.

1155
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,167
Why will they get killed?

1156
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:56,458
Why would everyone be killed?

1157
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:14,083
Lizzie.

1158
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:16,833
You were right.

1159
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:19,625
We will no longer stay in this house.

1160
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:22,542
We'll leave right away.

1161
01:24:23,417 --> 01:24:24,250
Come on.

1162
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:26,125
They're not finished yet, Paul.

1163
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,667
These two spirits...

1164
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:35,375
were scaring you to chase you away.

1165
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:37,500
But apart from
these two spirits...

1166
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:39,917
there's another spirit.

1167
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,500
Which is stopping you from leaving.

1168
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,333
<i>There's no use of running now.</i>

1169
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,458
<i>No matter where you go, that</i>
<i>spirit won't let go of you.</i>

1170
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:58,875
<i>I'm sorry, Paul.</i>

1171
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,750
Jai, I was waiting for you. Come in.

1172
01:25:15,917 --> 01:25:17,458
Doctor, here's the file
you had asked for.

1173
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:19,333
Sit.

1174
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,667
This case is 80 years old.

1175
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,875
That's why it took
a while to find it.

1176
01:27:29,042 --> 01:27:29,958
Lakshmi?

1177
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,250
Who is that?

1178
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:55,750
Is someone there?

1179
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:59,208
Lakshmi?

1180
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:22,500
Hey, hey!

1181
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:24,083
Baby, what happened?

1182
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:26,375
What happened?

1183
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:29,667
Did you have a nightmare?

1184
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:35,417
It's okay, go back to sleep.

1185
01:29:37,042 --> 01:29:38,042
Lie down.

1186
01:31:37,917 --> 01:31:39,875
The child's heartbeat
is normal, Krish.

1187
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:40,958
So nothing to worry.

1188
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:43,833
And you need bed rest for
the next two-three days.

1189
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:45,083
After that, you'll be completely alright.

1190
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:46,167
Thank you, Doctor.

1191
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:48,917
Thank you.

1192
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:00,292
There's something
inside Paul's house, Krish.

1193
01:32:01,792 --> 01:32:03,667
We should leave our house.

1194
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:05,833
That's their house.

1195
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:08,417
Why should we leave our house?

1196
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:13,458
Why did you need to
climb up the water tank?

1197
01:32:14,542 --> 01:32:15,667
You slipped and fell down.

1198
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,208
It was an accident.

1199
01:32:17,708 --> 01:32:21,917
There's no connection
between the two, Lakshmi.

1200
01:32:25,167 --> 01:32:28,000
<i>No, I didn't slip.</i>

1201
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,083
When I climbed up...

1202
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,708
I saw a little girl,
at top of the tank.

1203
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:39,500
That's why I got scared and fell down.

1204
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:42,833
The spirit in their house...

1205
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,875
has entered in our house too.

1206
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,292
<i>Calling, Dr. Krish.</i>

1207
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,000
<i>Calling, Dr. Krish.</i>

1208
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:51,833
<i>Dr. Krish to the OT.</i>

1209
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:56,500
I have to go.
You take rest.

1210
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:06,250
<i>Doctor?</i>

1211
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:08,667
<i>Dr. Arun is done with</i>
<i>his Pre-Op procedures.</i>

1212
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:10,500
<i>We're shifting him to the OT.</i>

1213
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:12,667
<i>We can go ahead with</i>
<i>the local anesthesia.</i>

1214
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:15,125
Doctor, can we go ahead
with the procedure?

1215
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:17,125
Just finish prep, I'm coming.

1216
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,292
Mr. Arvind, this is a
different kind of surgery.

1217
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
During this surgery
you can talk to me

1218
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:44,500
and to Dr. Shekar too.

1219
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:46,125
Shall we begin?

1220
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:48,917
I'm going to insert the
electrodes in to your brain.

1221
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:51,167
You won't feel any pain,
but will tickle a bit.

1222
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,917
Let's begin.
Okay?

1223
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,833
Inserting electrodes.

1224
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:59,750
Once the electrodes
are inserted

1225
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,042
you'll be able to stop the
shivering in your hand.

1226
01:34:03,583 --> 01:34:04,917
Deep brain stimulation is--

1227
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:17,792
Is everything okay, Doctor?

1228
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:19,542
Nothing.

1229
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:23,333
Nurse?

1230
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:25,125
Dab please.

1231
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:29,083
Deep brain stimulation is a
two way street, Arvind.

1232
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:30,625
Thanks.

1233
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:38,958
Again.
Concentrate, Arvind.

1234
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:44,750
You'll have to concentrate just as much.

1235
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,833
Stop the shivering, and stre--

1236
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:52,792
Doctor, are you sure you're okay?

1237
01:34:52,875 --> 01:34:53,833
I know what I'm doing, Sekhar.

1238
01:34:53,917 --> 01:34:54,958
Go and stand there.

1239
01:34:55,042 --> 01:34:56,167
You're here to observe.

1240
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:58,458
Let's continue.

1241
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:06,500
Arvind, keep your hand steady.

1242
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:12,458
And then lift the little
finger of your right hand.

1243
01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:18,750
No.

1244
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,750
Your hands are still shaky.

1245
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:22,458
Try once again.

1246
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:24,458
Try relaxing.

1247
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:26,792
Relax!

1248
01:35:38,292 --> 01:35:39,500
We'll...

1249
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:42,750
We'll try proceeding now.

1250
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:44,875
Inserting the the electrodes.

1251
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:50,417
What have you done?
Doctor, please step aside.

1252
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:52,917
Nurse, get a shot of dopamine.

1253
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:53,833
Quick!

1254
01:35:53,917 --> 01:35:55,500
<i>I think he's getting</i>
<i>a cardiac arrest.</i>

1255
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:56,792
<i>Hold him!</i>

1256
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:10,417
Dr. Usha Hegde.
(Cheif of Surgery)

1257
01:36:11,208 --> 01:36:14,750
<i>I haven't forgotten what you've</i>
<i>done for this hospital, Dr. Krish.</i>

1258
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:20,333
The truth is, if you were disturbed, you
shouldn't have walked in to the OT.

1259
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:25,708
Luckily, the patient is alive.

1260
01:36:25,792 --> 01:36:26,792
If not...

1261
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:30,667
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I'm going to have to suspend you.

1262
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:33,167
Think of it as a break.

1263
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:35,333
<i>Take care of your wife.</i>

1264
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:41,833
Krish!

1265
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,542
Two minutes.

1266
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,083
Years ago...

1267
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:51,708
something happened
in Paul's house.

1268
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:55,500
In order to know more,
I'm going to a village nearby.

1269
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:58,167
I'll come too.

1270
01:36:58,833 --> 01:36:59,750
Lakshmi?

1271
01:37:00,167 --> 01:37:01,583
She just needs to rest now.

1272
01:37:01,792 --> 01:37:02,875
Nurses will take care of her.

1273
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,792
I need to know what's happening, Doc.

1274
01:37:05,542 --> 01:37:07,250
I just can't take it anymore.

1275
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:09,708
Okay, I'll wait for
you downstairs.

1276
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:22,167
Did you find anything old
when you moved in here?

1277
01:37:23,167 --> 01:37:24,292
I don't think so...

1278
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:34,375
<i>If you feel attached to some item, your</i>
<i>emotions are bound to get invested.</i>

1279
01:37:35,292 --> 01:37:37,958
<i>Only people with ESP</i>
<i>abilities can feel it.</i>

1280
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:41,458
<i>I'm one of them.</i>

1281
01:37:58,333 --> 01:38:01,792
<i>"Little sparrowsÂ have gone</i>
<i>Back to their nests"</i>

1282
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:04,917
<i>"Little lambs are on their way home"</i>

1283
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:08,500
<i>"My baby, the moonlight is gently swaying"</i>

1284
01:38:24,542 --> 01:38:25,750
Where did you find this?

1285
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:38,042
Lakshmi said that she saw something.

1286
01:38:39,292 --> 01:38:40,292
I didn't believe her.

1287
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:42,875
I saw it too, in the
operation theater.

1288
01:38:44,833 --> 01:38:46,625
What's happening inside
that house, Doc?

1289
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:49,708
Eighty years ago...

1290
01:38:49,792 --> 01:38:53,500
there used to live a Chinese family,
where Paul's family is living right now.

1291
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:57,917
A man called, Lu Wei his
wife and their daughter.

1292
01:38:58,417 --> 01:38:59,792
Lu Wei was a silk trader.

1293
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:02,000
He used to import raw
silk from China

1294
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:05,667
and sell it here to the Kings, Princes
and the British officials.

1295
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:07,917
They lived there for many years.

1296
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,792
And suddenly, one day...

1297
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,917
their dead bodies were found in the house.

1298
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:13,833
What?

1299
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:16,583
-How did they die?
-No idea.

1300
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:20,083
But, I've come to know from
the police records that

1301
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:22,833
a little girl was an eye witness to it.

1302
01:39:23,542 --> 01:39:25,750
They say, she was absolutely
scared to speak, then.

1303
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:27,667
We're going to meet
that same girl now.

1304
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:30,333
If she wasn't able to speak then

1305
01:39:30,542 --> 01:39:32,625
will she speak now, after
so many years?

1306
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:33,833
I don't know.

1307
01:39:34,125 --> 01:39:36,625
But I know one thing.

1308
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:40,917
The future of Paul's family
is connected to that girl's past.

1309
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,500
Can we go a little faster?

1310
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:53,792
I come here whenever
I feel like smoking.

1311
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:56,000
Very rarely, Dad.

1312
01:39:59,667 --> 01:40:02,167
I found that comb
under this tree.

1313
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:55,292
We will have to dig this place.

1314
01:41:18,625 --> 01:41:19,583
Stop!

1315
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:21,833
Move aside.

1316
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:55,083
This is a woman's skeleton.

1317
01:41:55,667 --> 01:41:57,250
She was pregnant, when she died.

1318
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,750
This one, is a small kid.

1319
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:13,458
This kid's throat was slit.

1320
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:45,375
<i>People have cooked up many stories</i>
<i>in regards to that Chinese house.</i>

1321
01:42:45,708 --> 01:42:49,708
But we'll only be able to save the
family if you tell us the truth.

1322
01:42:49,917 --> 01:42:52,375
Tell us if you remember
anything about that day, please.

1323
01:42:56,333 --> 01:43:00,833
Considering my age,
I've forgotten about many things.

1324
01:43:01,417 --> 01:43:02,458
But...

1325
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:05,125
I'll never be able to forget...

1326
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:08,583
what happened that day.

1327
01:43:09,667 --> 01:43:14,708
The others would only let you know
what they heard from someone else.

1328
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:19,042
But, I was the only one

1329
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:22,250
who witnessed that
incident in person.

1330
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:26,833
It was during 1935.

1331
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:30,250
I must have been eight years old.

1332
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:34,042
<i>There was a beautiful</i>
<i>tree at that house.</i>

1333
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:38,542
<i>I used to go there, to</i>
<i>pluck flowers from that tree.</i>

1334
01:43:46,292 --> 01:43:48,208
There lived a Chinese man.

1335
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,250
<i>I used to be very scared of him.</i>

1336
01:43:58,542 --> 01:44:00,333
Hello, Paul?

1337
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:03,250
<i>-He had a wife...</i>
-Hello? Hello, Paul?

1338
01:44:03,417 --> 01:44:06,792
and a daughter of my age.

1339
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:12,542
<i>And that lady always used to</i>
<i>let me pluck the flowers.</i>

1340
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:17,875
<i>One day, when I went</i>
<i>there to pluck flowers...</i>

1341
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:20,042
<i>they weren't there.</i>

1342
01:44:21,292 --> 01:44:23,875
<i>Only that man was present there.</i>

1343
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:52,917
Let me go. Let me go!

1344
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,833
What are you doing? Let her go!

1345
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:07,750
According to this scroll, for ages

1346
01:45:07,833 --> 01:45:09,833
a boy child has taken birth when a girl
child has been sacrificed.

1347
01:45:09,917 --> 01:45:12,583
on the day of total
solar eclipse

1348
01:45:12,667 --> 01:45:15,375
What is this madness? Let her go!

1349
01:45:24,542 --> 01:45:28,042
Suddenly, the color
of the sky changed.

1350
01:45:28,333 --> 01:45:30,000
And, the daylight

1351
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:32,083
submerged in to the
darkness of the night.

1352
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:35,000
<i>There was a solar</i>
<i>eclipse on that day.</i>

1353
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:38,875
According to these ancient scrolls

1354
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:41,250
a boy is born if a girl
child is sacrificed

1355
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:43,875
on the day of a total solar eclipse.

1356
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:47,917
And it has to be done before
the solar eclipse ends.

1357
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:51,500
What has happened to you?
Why are you talking like this?

1358
01:45:51,583 --> 01:45:53,333
Oh Dark Lord!

1359
01:45:53,417 --> 01:45:55,500
Look at this! Oh Dark Lord.

1360
01:45:55,625 --> 01:45:57,667
Look at this! Oh Dark Lord.

1361
01:45:57,958 --> 01:45:59,458
You have ruined it.

1362
01:45:59,542 --> 01:46:01,792
There is very little time left.

1363
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:04,000
Now I have no other choice.

1364
01:46:04,083 --> 01:46:06,917
I am going to sacrifice
our daughter, Li Min.

1365
01:46:07,458 --> 01:46:09,917
I will not allow this.

1366
01:46:42,417 --> 01:46:45,917
Shall we play a game?

1367
01:46:46,583 --> 01:46:48,000
Okay, Dad.

1368
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,833
Do you want a baby brother to play with?

1369
01:46:56,917 --> 01:46:58,583
Yes, Dad. I do.

1370
01:46:58,667 --> 01:47:02,958
-Then you must do as I say.
-Yes, Dad. What should I do?

1371
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:05,917
Come, place your head here.

1372
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:51,750
If a boy can only be born

1373
01:48:51,833 --> 01:48:54,167
by sacrificing a girl

1374
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:58,042
then such a child
is not required.

1375
01:48:58,125 --> 01:49:01,292
And even if it is a boy,
you shall never have him.

1376
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:23,792
<i>"The stars in the sky are your company"</i>

1377
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:27,875
<i>"Tomorrow will be another good day"</i>

1378
01:49:27,958 --> 01:49:33,833
<i>"My baby, sleep in my arms"</i>

1379
01:49:33,958 --> 01:49:37,167
This is not the end. Just the beginning.

1380
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,500
<i>"Baby I love you</i>
<i>In your sweet dreams"</i>

1381
01:49:40,583 --> 01:49:43,792
<i>"Little lambs and the stars"</i>

1382
01:49:44,208 --> 01:49:50,417
<i>"Will join and play with you"</i>

1383
01:49:56,167 --> 01:50:02,375
Since then, I get really tensed just by
the mere mention of the solar eclipse.

1384
01:50:02,917 --> 01:50:04,208
Tomorrow...

1385
01:50:04,583 --> 01:50:07,208
there will be a solar eclipse, once again.

1386
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:11,167
<i>Once again.</i>

1387
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:19,458
All this while, these spirits
were just trying to warn you.

1388
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:24,250
But Lu Wei's soul was...

1389
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:27,500
not letting you leave.

1390
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:31,750
You said it was Paul's
call, anything urgent?

1391
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:33,750
I've been trying, but
there's no network.

1392
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:35,167
I'll try once again.

1393
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:07,417
Go away.

1394
01:51:36,792 --> 01:51:37,625
Nurse?

1395
01:51:38,458 --> 01:51:39,458
Nurse!

1396
01:51:40,458 --> 01:51:41,417
Nurse!

1397
01:52:01,083 --> 01:52:04,208
Go away.

1398
01:52:04,375 --> 01:52:05,833
Oh my God!

1399
01:52:07,375 --> 01:52:08,833
Somebody help me!

1400
01:52:08,917 --> 01:52:10,917
Help me, please!

1401
01:53:12,042 --> 01:53:14,833
March 9th, 2016.
Day of the total solar eclipse.

1402
01:53:16,708 --> 01:53:18,083
Where are Jenny and Sarah?

1403
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:19,333
Call them quick.

1404
01:53:19,458 --> 01:53:22,542
Paul, it's not safe to leave
until the eclipse is over.

1405
01:53:24,542 --> 01:53:28,375
It's better to leave rather than
stay here and wait for death.

1406
01:53:30,667 --> 01:53:31,625
Lizzie!

1407
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:33,750
But how is the
eclipse connected to this?

1408
01:53:35,917 --> 01:53:36,792
One second.

1409
01:53:37,625 --> 01:53:38,708
Yeah, tell me dear.

1410
01:53:39,042 --> 01:53:40,042
Krish, where are you?

1411
01:53:40,667 --> 01:53:42,000
I need to talk to you, in person.

1412
01:53:42,125 --> 01:53:43,208
<i>Where's Jenny?</i>

1413
01:53:43,458 --> 01:53:44,292
Jenny?

1414
01:53:44,708 --> 01:53:47,083
No idea. Doc and I are
headed to Paul's house.

1415
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:48,167
Is that so?

1416
01:53:49,167 --> 01:53:51,375
I'll get discharged from
here and see you there.

1417
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:52,625
So you're going to be there too?

1418
01:53:52,708 --> 01:53:53,708
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Okay.

1419
01:53:57,208 --> 01:54:02,542
<i>Today's solar eclipse is</i> <i>believed</i>
<i>to be a total solar eclipse.</i>

1420
01:54:02,667 --> 01:54:07,083
<i>It will be the longest</i>
<i>in 100 years.</i>

1421
01:54:07,167 --> 01:54:08,333
<i>-It will last for</i>
-Ma'am?

1422
01:54:08,417 --> 01:54:10,417
<i>-seven and a half minutes.</i>
-Ma'am, sign.

1423
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:15,167
<i>It has attracted many tourists and</i>
<i>researchers to Himachal Pradesh.</i>

1424
01:54:15,583 --> 01:54:19,208
<i>People have been warned that it should not</i>
<i>be looked at without proper precautions.</i>

1425
01:54:19,292 --> 01:54:22,542
<i>The warning has been issued</i>
<i>by the Meteorological Department.</i>

1426
01:54:29,542 --> 01:54:30,417
Krish!

1427
01:54:30,583 --> 01:54:32,167
Pastor has regained consciousness.

1428
01:54:32,667 --> 01:54:33,583
That's good.

1429
01:54:34,083 --> 01:54:35,042
Did he say something?

1430
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:36,958
He wasn't able to speak well.

1431
01:54:37,167 --> 01:54:40,333
But he's asked to keep Jenny locked
inside a room for the next hour.

1432
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:43,333
Okay. Doc just called, he said
he'll be here in ten minutes.

1433
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:46,333
He asked us to be with Jenny
until the eclipse is over.

1434
01:54:49,542 --> 01:54:50,958
Paul.
Where's Jenny?

1435
01:54:51,542 --> 01:54:52,875
-Jenny?
-She's packing her stuff.

1436
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:54,250
I need to talk to her.

1437
01:54:54,667 --> 01:54:55,583
Why? What happened?

1438
01:54:55,667 --> 01:54:57,042
Nothing to worry,
I'll let you know later.

1439
01:54:57,208 --> 01:54:58,667
Krish, come.

1440
01:55:00,667 --> 01:55:02,083
Is Sarah with Jenny?

1441
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,750
She must be around.

1442
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:10,792
Krish!

1443
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:13,833
What happened?

1444
01:55:13,917 --> 01:55:15,125
Check if Jenny is inside.

1445
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:16,458
Why don't you check, Lakshmi?

1446
01:55:16,667 --> 01:55:17,500
Sarah!

1447
01:55:17,708 --> 01:55:19,708
Please, Krish. I'm scared.

1448
01:55:25,458 --> 01:55:26,292
Jenny?

1449
01:55:26,667 --> 01:55:27,542
Jenny!

1450
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:28,833
She's not here.

1451
01:55:28,917 --> 01:55:29,917
Look properly.

1452
01:55:30,125 --> 01:55:31,208
Please look, Krish.

1453
01:55:32,208 --> 01:55:33,125
Jenny?

1454
01:55:36,292 --> 01:55:39,292
Not every spirit is against God.

1455
01:55:40,625 --> 01:55:44,583
But there is one, at Paul's house.

1456
01:55:49,833 --> 01:55:50,667
Dad?

1457
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,667
Pastor said that, Krish
is the reason behind

1458
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:09,708
everything bad that's
happened in here.

1459
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,458
<i>Lakshmi, open the door.</i>

1460
01:56:11,917 --> 01:56:15,708
Krish has been possessed by the soul
of the man who died in this house.

1461
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:16,958
What?

1462
01:56:23,292 --> 01:56:24,125
<i>Paul!</i>

1463
01:56:24,208 --> 01:56:26,208
-Krish is not in his senses.
<i>-Open the door!</i>

1464
01:56:26,292 --> 01:56:28,667
Someone will die before
the eclipse is over.

1465
01:56:29,042 --> 01:56:31,083
I can't stop him by myself.

1466
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:32,792
We all have to
stop him together.

1467
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:33,708
<i>Paul!</i>

1468
01:56:34,292 --> 01:56:35,125
<i>Lakshmi!</i>

1469
01:56:35,917 --> 01:56:37,000
<i>Open the door!</i>

1470
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:38,708
<i>Open the door!</i>

1471
01:56:41,792 --> 01:56:44,833
<i>This is not the end.</i>

1472
01:56:52,667 --> 01:56:54,917
Lu Wei had sacrificed his
own child in this house.

1473
01:56:55,917 --> 01:56:58,250
But he didn't get what
he had desired for.

1474
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:04,333
Today, Lu Wei will definitely use
Krish to fulfill his motives.

1475
01:57:22,458 --> 01:57:23,458
Oh my God!

1476
01:57:25,375 --> 01:57:26,458
Dr. Prasad...

1477
01:57:26,917 --> 01:57:27,958
praying to God?

1478
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:29,500
Why?

1479
01:57:35,667 --> 01:57:36,583
Let me tell you.

1480
01:57:38,542 --> 01:57:41,083
Li Jing's spirit, possessed Jenny

1481
01:57:41,167 --> 01:57:43,875
to save Paul's
family at any cost.

1482
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:45,250
<i>But from whom?</i>

1483
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:47,542
<i>When I was going through</i>
<i>these records...</i>

1484
01:57:47,625 --> 01:57:49,583
I came to know that Lu Wei and you

1485
01:57:49,833 --> 01:57:53,833
Dr. V. S. Krishna Kumar
have the same birth dates.

1486
01:57:54,625 --> 01:57:56,958
<i>Different year but same date.</i>

1487
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:00,458
Same person?

1488
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:02,458
<i>That's the reason I was praying.</i>

1489
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:07,333
Because if the Devil
exists, then so does God.

1490
01:58:07,583 --> 01:58:10,375
<i>I asked you not to</i>
<i>analyze my brain, Doc.</i>

1491
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:34,958
This way.

1492
01:58:36,667 --> 01:58:37,500
Jenny...

1493
01:58:37,875 --> 01:58:39,083
where's Sarah?

1494
01:58:55,708 --> 01:58:56,833
Krish?

1495
01:58:59,583 --> 01:59:00,917
Jenny, Sarah?

1496
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,417
Both of them are with
Paul, they'll be safe.

1497
01:59:04,125 --> 01:59:05,458
How do we stop Krish?

1498
01:59:05,542 --> 01:59:06,792
I'll distract him.

1499
01:59:06,958 --> 01:59:09,292
You guys try to get
the kids out of here.

1500
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,958
Sarah.

1501
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:47,667
Where is Sarah?

1502
01:59:54,375 --> 01:59:55,958
Sarah?
No.

1503
01:59:57,792 --> 01:59:59,917
Sarah, hide.

1504
02:00:06,167 --> 02:00:09,667
Sarah!

1505
02:00:10,208 --> 02:00:12,583
Sarah!

1506
02:00:13,083 --> 02:00:14,708
Sarah!

1507
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,208
Krish, please.

1508
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:18,333
Please, Krish.

1509
02:00:18,583 --> 02:00:20,250
Listen to me.

1510
02:00:20,625 --> 02:00:21,458
Krish.

1511
02:00:21,917 --> 02:00:23,458
Krish, you're true but the
one inside you is not.

1512
02:00:24,167 --> 02:00:25,458
Krish, look at me.

1513
02:00:28,625 --> 02:00:29,500
No.

1514
02:00:36,583 --> 02:00:37,417
Sarah.

1515
02:00:37,792 --> 02:00:38,875
Sarah, run.

1516
02:00:39,167 --> 02:00:40,708
Run, Sarah.

1517
02:00:41,542 --> 02:00:45,125
She can run,
but she can't hide from me.

1518
02:00:55,958 --> 02:00:59,208
The girl will die.

1519
02:01:07,917 --> 02:01:09,000
Dad.

1520
02:01:14,042 --> 02:01:17,375
-Dad!
-Sarah, run!

1521
02:01:26,833 --> 02:01:28,292
Please, spare my child.

1522
02:01:39,958 --> 02:01:41,083
Dad!

1523
02:01:59,125 --> 02:02:00,458
Why did you stop?

1524
02:02:00,583 --> 02:02:01,583
Chase us!

1525
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:03,458
Why are you standing
there? Come.

1526
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:08,042
Sarah, run!

1527
02:02:08,458 --> 02:02:09,458
Run!

1528
02:02:09,917 --> 02:02:11,125
She's gone from here.

1529
02:02:11,208 --> 02:02:12,375
She's not in the house.

1530
02:02:18,208 --> 02:02:21,167
Krish, please let my sister go.

1531
02:02:21,625 --> 02:02:22,750
Please!

1532
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,417
Sarah?

1533
02:02:38,833 --> 02:02:40,375
What are you up to, dear?

1534
02:02:40,458 --> 02:02:43,292
I was waiting for you, Dad.

1535
02:03:22,958 --> 02:03:27,417
Do you want a little
brother to play with?

1536
02:03:27,583 --> 02:03:29,000
I do, Dad.

1537
02:03:29,875 --> 02:03:32,417
Then, you'll have to listen to me.

1538
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:33,917
Okay, Dad. I'll listen to you.

1539
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,792
Come and place your
beautiful face here.

1540
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,083
Okay, Dad.

1541
02:03:57,792 --> 02:03:58,625
Hey!

1542
02:04:05,625 --> 02:04:06,542
Krish!

1543
02:04:06,958 --> 02:04:08,417
Let her go, Krish.

1544
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:10,083
Please let her go.

1545
02:04:10,458 --> 02:04:11,667
Let the kid go.

1546
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:14,458
The girl will die.

1547
02:04:15,208 --> 02:04:17,125
-This girl should die.
-No.

1548
02:04:17,208 --> 02:04:19,958
With her death, a boy will be born.

1549
02:04:20,042 --> 02:04:21,417
No, Krish.

1550
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:22,958
Krish, listen to me.

1551
02:04:24,375 --> 02:04:25,958
Krish, I'll kill myself.

1552
02:04:27,458 --> 02:04:30,417
If a boy can only be born
by sacrificing a girl...

1553
02:04:30,917 --> 02:04:32,417
then such a child
is not required.

1554
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:35,375
<i>And even if it s boy,</i>
<i>you shall never have him.</i>

1555
02:04:48,125 --> 02:04:49,958
Sarah!

1556
02:04:50,417 --> 02:04:51,583
Krish, don't do it.

1557
02:04:51,667 --> 02:04:52,500
No!

1558
02:04:52,917 --> 02:04:53,750
Sarah!

1559
02:04:53,875 --> 02:04:55,042
Krish, no.

1560
02:04:55,458 --> 02:04:56,833
Krish, no. Krish!

1561
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:58,333
Paul!

1562
02:04:59,333 --> 02:05:00,167
Krish!

1563
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,667
Pin him down!

1564
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:11,375
Krish, listen to me.

1565
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:12,667
Krish!

1566
02:05:12,958 --> 02:05:15,333
Lizzie, take Sarah away.

1567
02:05:15,833 --> 02:05:16,833
Sarah!

1568
02:05:19,542 --> 02:05:20,958
Come on!

1569
02:05:43,875 --> 02:05:48,583
Sarah!

1570
02:05:49,125 --> 02:05:54,625
Sarah!

1571
02:06:25,667 --> 02:06:26,667
Krish, no.

1572
02:06:26,750 --> 02:06:27,708
No, Krish.

1573
02:06:40,708 --> 02:06:42,000
Li-Jing?

1574
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,167
Let him go.

1575
02:06:59,875 --> 02:07:01,542
We've done what was
required of us.

1576
02:07:06,208 --> 02:07:07,250
The eclipse is over.

1577
02:07:09,125 --> 02:07:10,333
They'll take care of him now.

1578
02:07:31,958 --> 02:07:32,792
Krish.

1579
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
This is not the end.

1580
02:07:52,958 --> 02:07:53,792
Krish?

1581
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:55,083
Krish?

1582
02:07:55,583 --> 02:07:56,708
Oh my God, Krish.

1583
02:07:57,083 --> 02:07:58,167
Krish, can you hear me?

1584
02:07:58,667 --> 02:07:59,500
Krish?

1585
02:08:00,958 --> 02:08:02,125
-Lakshmi?
-Yes.

1586
02:08:03,042 --> 02:08:04,208
-Sarah, baby.
-Yes.

1587
02:08:06,083 --> 02:08:07,125
-Dad!
-Mom.

1588
02:08:10,917 --> 02:08:12,083
What happened?

1589
02:08:13,125 --> 02:08:14,042
Nothing.

1590
02:08:14,542 --> 02:08:15,750
Nothing, dear.

1591
02:08:20,083 --> 02:08:21,417
Shall we go home now?

1592
02:08:45,792 --> 02:08:49,125
Morjim Beach, Goa.
4 years later.

1593
02:08:59,833 --> 02:09:00,667
-Hi!
-Hi!

1594
02:09:01,125 --> 02:09:01,958
Come in.

1595
02:09:02,083 --> 02:09:03,125
-Hi.
-Hey!

1596
02:09:03,208 --> 02:09:04,083
Welcome home.

1597
02:09:04,167 --> 02:09:06,417
-So good to see you.
-Thank you.

1598
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,708
-Parson School of Design.
-Wow!

1599
02:09:08,333 --> 02:09:09,750
I've heard a lot
about that college.

1600
02:09:09,833 --> 02:09:11,500
-Yeah!
-It's in New York, right?

1601
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:12,583
Great news.

1602
02:09:12,667 --> 02:09:13,625
-Yeah.
-When are you leaving?

1603
02:09:13,708 --> 02:09:15,792
She said she won't leave
until she meets Krish.

1604
02:09:15,958 --> 02:09:17,583
I meant both Krish and Lakshmi.

1605
02:09:19,958 --> 02:09:21,417
In fact, the three of them.

1606
02:09:22,208 --> 02:09:23,333
Where's our hero?

1607
02:09:23,458 --> 02:09:24,875
-Oh, him?
-Where's he?

<i>I need you!</i>
