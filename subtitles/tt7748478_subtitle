Come keep this inside the room.

19
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:45,803
Here..Here.. Inside

20
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,022
Sit down.

21
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:23,277
SO Finally you decided to leave.

22
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:24,028
Yes..

23
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,870
Now i don't feel like
living in Kolhapur,

24
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,621
as you too are not there
and no else is there too.

25
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:36,585
I am planning to get my
daughter married Savi Sister

26
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:39,707
Yes. But have you finished
renovating your house?

27
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,418
If you had not lent me the
money it wouldn't have been possible.

28
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,591
If you require anything more,
tell me for sure.

29
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:51,885
Yes Sister. These are the
keys of your Kolhapur house.

30
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:57,508
May I leave?

31
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,180
The tempo person needs to leave too.

32
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,721
Ok.

33
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:07,605
Sister as I fix my daughter's
marriage I will inform you...

34
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,726
It will be a great honor if you come.

35
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:10,557
I will surely come

36
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:12,228
Ok..will leave now

37
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:11,722
This is the story of me and Ammi.

38
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,633
Now who is this Ammi?

39
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,935
Slowly, slowly you will know.

40
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:18,727
So, the story is of two people...

41
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:23,730
So here I am telling you the story...

42
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,143
I am Savitri Jagdish Sardesai.

43
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:33,316
Good Morning friends.

44
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:39,740
It is said that God cannot be present
everywhere so he created mothers.

45
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,612
She does many things for us.

46
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,863
She works hard night and day.

47
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:47,325
She takes care of what
we want and don't want.

48
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:49,786
Teaches us good habits.

49
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:52,368
She teaches us the difference
between right and wrong.

50
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:54,790
She showers love on us.

51
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,911
but she's also strict at times

52
00:07:58,001 --> 00:08:00,373
She knows our likes and dislikes.

53
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,543
As she looks at us she comes to
know what's going on in our mind.

54
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,755
What a bore she is.

55
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,625
Now even I'll have to cry.

56
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:12,550
Do you remember whenever we
have got hurt have we ever called dad?

57
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,052
No we always call out for our mother.

58
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:19,635
she gives us everything without ego

59
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,637
without any expectation.

60
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:33,893
We should be proud that
we have our mother with us.

61
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,685
She stands by us with
all her strength in every situation.

62
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:38,066
Miss, Savi is also crying.

63
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:42,188
Savi and Gayatri what happened? Huh!

64
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,360
Miss they both don't have a mother

65
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,033
Oh! Please don't cry okay...be calm...

66
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:50,745
Geeta take them out.

67
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:51,575
Yes Miss

68
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:52,115
Come

69
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,038
That's why friends give
respect to your mother...

70
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,910
love her a lot... thank you.

71
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,086
Ok..lets go..savi..

72
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,798
Savi...TAKE

73
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,423
Today Karuna gave a good speech, na?

74
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:24,215
I think her father must
have given her points...

75
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:27,637
normally she's not even able to write
4 sentences when it comes to an essay,

76
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,018
but her speech was
very touching na ...

77
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:30,640
Yes

78
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,810
While listening I
also remembered my mom.

79
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,932
As I reach home I will
kiss her on her cheek.

80
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:35,773
Okay

81
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,435
Why are you only saying yes?

82
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,396
Sorry are you feeling hurt?

83
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,937
Are you missing your mom?

84
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:45,938
Neha, I am not hurt

85
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,820
Then why did you cry so much?

86
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,231
Because no one should tease me.

87
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:53,983
In fact I can't even remember
how my mother looked..

88
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:56,405
Sudha Jagdish Sardesai -

89
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:56,825
Eh

90
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:58,787
That's my mother's name.

91
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:04,120
Besides her name and photo and
the album I don't know much about her.

92
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,211
Akka why are you taking it your heart?

93
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:25,383
I have told you na that I
have no time for second marriage.

94
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:28,845
No...no...no...I will not
take any decision emotionally..

95
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:30,927
I will not do any
adjustments for anyone..

96
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,808
Yes I have decided everything...

97
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,601
No my decision won't affect Savi...

98
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,683
You feel I am lying?

99
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:42,605
Wait I'll ask her....Savi..

100
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:44,895
Do you feel you get less of anything.

101
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:48,108
do you feel i should re-marry?...

102
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:50,820
tell na..

103
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,610
Do you miss your mom?...

104
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:55,613
tell the truth.

105
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:57,113
No, not at all

106
00:10:57,483 --> 00:11:00,615
Good! i know it....

107
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:04,238
we are not emotional fools.

108
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:06,870
we are practical..okay...

109
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,622
are you listening Akka?..

110
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:12,993
this only is what
I was telling you na...

111
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:15,375
but you don't trust me!

112
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:17,836
then?

113
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,748
whatever facts that come before me

114
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:25,041
and while taking a decision
i think with practicality

115
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,462
since then that's how I have become.

116
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:30,003
As that only happens...

117
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,425
but it just got underlined...

118
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:34,927
I was my father's daughter.

119
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:37,098
He has only brought me up..

120
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:42,181
Thus I am practical,
impulsive and stubborn.

121
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:47,725
Good evening Savi!

122
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,306
Good evening Paanse Uncle.

123
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:51,728
If you have come I
am sure Appa has also come

124
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,768
Not yet.
Shankar has gone with the car.

125
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:56,310
Yesterday it got late to
receive papers from the court.

126
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,731
So he left today morning.

127
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,983

registration has to be done.

131
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:31,963
As sir comes I will
have a word with him.

132
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:37,006
Okay.

133
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:39,337
Good evening Sir!

134
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,138

Sir, yesterday in the
court your crossfire was good -

150
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,001
Ya the witness was lying,
the case will be in our favour.

151
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,962
Fix the meeting with Mokhsin

152
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,627

Ok.

157
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:20,400
If I had done any
faster I would have died.

158
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:25,703
Should I tell you something funny?

159
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:26,745

160
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:29,156
My Appa got married.

What?

162
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,408
Today he brought his
new wife at home.

163
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,501
Without informing you! means..

164
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,913
he was not ready for
another marriage na ?

165
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,375
Yes.. but he did.

166
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:44,666
Oh god !

167
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:46,337
Now?

168
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:51,050
Now what? There are so many
servants at home now one more.

169
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,633
Is she a servant?
She will be a part of your family now.

170
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,015
That's true.

171
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:01,927
How's she?

172
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:05,428
She's okay nothing special.

173
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,981
She must be 7 to 8 years older than us

174
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:11,603
Savi what I feel..

175
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,854
You must be feeling lonely like..

176
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:16,816
That's what your father must have thought
that's why he must have re married.

177
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:17,776
No please.

178
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:22,940
We have so many staff at home
and even dad's clients visit often.

179
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,901
So there is always hustle at home,

180
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,283
I never feel either
lonely or neglected.

181
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,903
Then why did he do this?

182
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,575
let it be why are we thinking?

183
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:34,447
It's his decision.
He will see what he has to do.

184
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:38,750
Savi look, she's your step mom..

185
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,871
She will harass you

186
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:45,583
Lets see who harasses whom

187
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:56,420
The right to initiate criminal

188
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:02,765
or civil legal action against
you is at your own risk...

189
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,306
as to cost and consequences.

190
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:08,178
Yes...

191
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:09,638
OK

192
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,680
and take further date for more...

00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:16,683

194
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,563
Yes Sir!

195
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:24,355
Sir

196
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:24,766
Yes

197
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:26,977
These are print outs
of supporting case laws

198
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,938
and I have marked the sections.

199
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:29,569
Yes

200
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,020
Call me if you need anything

201
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:31,820
Yes

202
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,821
Good night sir!

203
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:34,152
Good night, Good night!

204
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,870
You...let it be.. what I have to do...

205
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:50,242
if she wants to eat she'll
eat or else she'll stay hungry..

206
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:55,455
sir shall I serve you more?

207
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,918
John you know how much I eat at night?

208
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,838
Sorry Sir

209
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:05,712
Yes

210
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:34,860
What should I call her?

211
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,311
Ah

212
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:40,863
What should I call her?

213
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:42,565
Whom?

214
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:44,196
Your wife?

215
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:48,988
Everyone at her house called her Ammi

216
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,200
But i am not from her house

217
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:54,993
Then you only decide
what you want to call her?

218
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:37,650
Shankar place this bag in the boot and
place these books in the back seat.

219
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,480
Yes

220
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:45,665
did you sleep well?

221
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:49,917
It's a new place.
Gradually you will become habitual..

222
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:56,301
If you need anything tell
John and Savi too is here.

223
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:07,638
He is saying Savi is there..
I am there means?

224
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:10,890
Did he ask me before getting married?

225
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:26,190
Okay John interior
designers are coming.

226
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,282
Till I return from Pune
get the bedroom work done.

227
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:31,323
Till then keep Amala's
stuff in the guest room.

228
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:31,943
Yes Sir

229
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:32,533
Ah

230
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:41,327
what is it?

231
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,332
I don't like it if anyone
enters my room without my permission.

232
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,243
now that you have come then wait...

233
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:59,498
why are you standing
over my head? Sit..

234
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:21,802
are you dumb?

235
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:26,765
Then? It's been 17 to
18 hours you are in this house

236
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,147
and i haven't heard your voice yet.

237
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,018
I am telling the truth...

238
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,231
No.. I can talk.

239
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,612
Ya, good!

240
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:45,617
Your room is beautiful.

241
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,698
What's nice in this?

242
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,408
Don't tell anything.

243
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:50,490
I know my room is a mess

244
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,411
But I like my room as it is.

245
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:58,165
Which school do you go to?

246
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:00,326
Sanjeevani High school.

247
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:03,748
It's an English medium school.

248
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:05,880
Which standard

249
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:08,921
10th standard..

250
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:12,333
10th standard..

251
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,585
I am a topper in my school....

252
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,802
I have read that novel.
Its nice you can take it.

253
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:29,975
What happened?

254
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:32,936
I can't read and write much

255
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:34,227
What?

256
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:35,978
What did you say?

257
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,230
You don't know English?

258
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:43,103
or Marathi ?

259
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:48,736
Then what will you do at home all day?

260
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:51,358
Will do something

261
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,113
Give it here give

262
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:00,743
Neha

263
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:01,785
Savi..

264
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:03,666
Get that Savi.

265
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:07,118
OH NO

266
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:09,120
OH HO

267
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,212
Neha, this is the first person i know
who does not know to read or write

268
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:14,963
Who

269
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:17,425
Appa's wife

270
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:18,755
What are you saying?

271
00:24:19,756 --> 00:24:21,377
Means not even ABC

272
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:22,338
No

273
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:23,878
Can she speak Marathi?

274
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:24,798
Neha Please okay!

275
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,510
No..not like that..
she cannot read or write.

276
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,432
I wondered whether
she can speak or not

277
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:33,635
or else she must be speaking
some tribal language..

278
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,766
You are speaking a lot now, Neha !

279
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:37,557
Sorry

280
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,478
But see na

281
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:41,140
Huh

282
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,483
my Appa,
how much fame he has in Kolhapur!

283
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:48,693
He speaks superb english

284
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,776
and his wife doesn't even
know to read and write marathi

285
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:54,608
Eh

286
00:24:55,028 --> 00:24:57,490
Savi, let her go ..

287
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,530
after knowing you for so many years

288
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:02,783
I haven't seen you talk with
so much curiosity about someone.

289
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:08,826
Actually let it be ....
what I need to do ?

290
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:12,458
Where am I going to discuss
about literature with her?

291
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:13,620
Hmm..

292
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,370
SAVI

293
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,011
Oh.. how many days
are you going to work?

294
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:34,633
Madam two to three days more

295
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:36,513
Since 8 days I am
listening the same thing.

296
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:38,175
Way is blocked..

297
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,142
Are you sleeping?

298
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,896
No I am awake

299
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,688
Why have you covered your
face with the handkerchief?

300
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,781
This dust annoys me

301
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:05,862
They are working downstairs.

302
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:08,403
Is the dust coming
up here into your nose?

303
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:10,655
You are very delicate.

304
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,288
I need to make you strong...

305
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:18,250
John has Appa come from the village?

306
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,871
No Savitri sister.

307
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:27,756
Savitri, only three days are
left to fill the board exam form

308
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,167
still you haven't taken
your dad's signature.

309
00:26:31,128 --> 00:26:33,920
I did not expect this from you.

310
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:40,633
Miss, I told my father,
but he's out of town.

311
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:43,135
Have you informed
him about the last date?

312
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:44,556
I told him

313
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:47,518
But court date keeps changing.

314
00:26:48,178 --> 00:26:49,770
So now what to do?

315
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,932
Today I will call him again

316
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:57,645
Okay, but I will need to tell
this to the principal.

317
00:26:58,475 --> 00:26:59,686
You may go now.

318
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,233
Savi how long you took?
I am waiting since when.

319
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:12,653
We need to go for recess or else will
get late for the rehersal... come fast.

320
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:14,285
He does this every time.

321
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:16,326
When he's called to school
he never comes on time.

322
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:19,738
He thinks that he pays the fees for the
whole year so his responsibility is over.

323
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,290
How many times shall I speak
on his behalf to the teacher?

324
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,911
what happened now?

325
00:27:24,952 --> 00:27:26,953
Forms last submission
date has come near,

326
00:27:27,043 --> 00:27:29,415
but Appa has not signed on the form.

327
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:32,997
If it were possible for me then I would
have made a stamp of his signature.

328
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:35,458
Come

329
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:36,128
Neha

330
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:36,879
Yes

331
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,961
Is it fine if someone else
signs on his behalf?

332
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:47,255
Here is my exam form.

333
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:50,508
Actually I need your signature, but
you can give your thumb impression.

334
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:55,891
see this...
dip your finger here and then...

335
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:59,063
But I can sign my name.

336
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,976
You only said....

337
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:06,067
I know only that much

338
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:21,947
A..M...A...L..A..

339
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:31,663
You don't take unnecessary stress.

340
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,125
You just come to sir...

341
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,955
Sir will find a way out for this..

342
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:36,536
will bring this to Sir's notice.

343
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:37,337
Yes

344
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,378
Sir has arrived.

345
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:42,630
Mokashi you here at this hour?

346
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,252
Sir, his partner has claimed
for losses in billions.

347
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:45,752
Yes, yes..

348
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:47,923
This notice has come today

349
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,215
Yes..

350
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:54,007
yes he's doing something
else only besides the case...

351
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:56,008
Fix a meeting with him..

352
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,260
Have you told Mokashi the whole truth?

353
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,260
Yes Sir
- Hmmm

354
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,721
Sir we should also send notice

355
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:01,892
No, We will send him notice,

356
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:04,223
but also mention in that
we want to meet him.

357
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:05,725
But sir; what's the need to meet him?

358
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:08,186
How will we know what
is going on in his head?

359
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,688
We should also listen
to the opposite party..

360
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:12,648
First we will meet
then we will decide.

361
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,560
Okay Sir.

362
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,062
Don't worry Mokashi we are
not afraid of this kind of notice.

363
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:17,692
Thank you sir!

364
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:18,523
You may leave.

365
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:19,563
sir

366
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:25,737
Mokashi I am leaving

367
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:28,870
Sir will find a
way out of this... come

368
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,623
Chattering

369
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:38,735
Come

370
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:00,920
Come na

371
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,840
Come

372
00:30:06,343 --> 00:30:07,543
Kala khatta

373
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:08,795
Brother ... give two Kala khatta

374
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:11,005
Give fast

375
00:30:11,886 --> 00:30:12,887
How many you'll eat?

376
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:13,928
Three..

377
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:16,098
I will also have three.. laughing

378
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,353
1 2 3

379
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:39,863
1 2 3

380
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:04,328
Come here you

381
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,001
Come here

382
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:14,005
Slurping

383
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:15,716
Is she the one

384
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,223
You also take 1 gola..

385
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,597
Why? You don't like?

386
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:33,347
Hmm..

387
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:34,518
Then take it?

388
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:39,521
Once I felt... but no

389
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,773
If you felt then you should do it,

390
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,853
you should not keep thinking about it.

391
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:45,605
The moment is important

392
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,607
If I eat something
chilled then I'll get cold

393
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:51,448
Nothing will happen.

394
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:54,360
We ate three gola's
do we have a cold?

395
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,162
You also have. If you fall
sick I will take you to the doctor....

396
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:58,073
come...

397
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:01,245
Brother give her one gola.

398
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:03,536
She's my friend Neha

399
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:04,286
Hello

400
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:07,418
Neha look she's my step mom..

401
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:10,830
you were telling me she
will harass me..

402
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,001
she's the one.

403
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:36,346
John what are you looking at?

404
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,018
Doctor has come

405
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:40,058
Who has fallen ill?

406
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:45,272
bring these medicines

407
00:32:45,352 --> 00:32:45,733
Yes

408
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:47,813
I will send the nurse every alternate
day to give injections.

409
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:48,605
Okay

410
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:50,986
Let me know if the
temperature increases.

411
00:32:52,146 --> 00:32:57,150
Mrs Sardesai I have given medicines
take it daily without fail..

412
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,282
Ignoring health will not help?
yes.. okay..

413
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:02,153
take care

414
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:02,863
John

415
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:06,035
tell Shankar to leave the doctor...
take this.

416
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:06,956
Yes sir

417
00:33:07,456 --> 00:33:08,156
Ok.. I'm leaving..

418
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:09,037
Thank you.

419
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:15,661
such a simple thing
you don't understand o-what?

420
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,753
What was the need to have Gola?

421
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:22,915
Appa I told her to eat

422
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:26,088
Tomorrow she will say jump
from the terrace, will you jump?

423
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,130
And what was the need
for you to force her?

424
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,840
See what's her state now

425
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:33,132
Nothing happens in eating one gola

426
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:34,883
Everybody can't take it!

427
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:39,346
It's just normal fever she's not dying

428
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:43,388
Savi where Amala is concerned I don't want
any carelessness I won't be okay with it.

429
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:46,560
Oh.. possessive and all..

430
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:48,932
then take her and sit

431
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:50,353
Savi..

432
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:51,893
sneezing

433
00:33:55,856 --> 00:33:57,317
Did we do wrong?

434
00:33:57,738 --> 00:34:01,190
She has fever. Doctor had also come.

435
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,320
Oh god!

436
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,572
Appa shouted at me that's separate!

437
00:34:05,823 --> 00:34:06,863
Poor her

438
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:08,615
You are feeling pity for her

439
00:34:08,695 --> 00:34:09,945
No Not like that.

440
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,286
But we should have not forced her

441
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:14,998
Yes

442
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,370
Neha.. I will call you later

443
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:56,064
John

444
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:56,815
hmm..

445
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:03,358
give this to her

446
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,731
Should I tell her that you have given?

447
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,902
Have I told you to say so?

448
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:10,903
Then?

449
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,867
And if you drop even a drop of soup
on the card then.. I will see you..

450
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:18,368
Go

451
00:36:03,016 --> 00:36:04,857
Don't you want to
say anything on this?

452
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:06,318
On what?

453
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:08,980
I prepared a card for you

454
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,822
I was about to tell your
father to look. What is it?

455
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:14,483
I have given you a sorry card...
not your husband..

456
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:18,866
But where I know to read,
so was about to ask him

457
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:22,408
Get well soon.

458
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:23,448
What?

459
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,160
Get well soon

460
00:36:29,873 --> 00:36:32,085
and there is no need
to show my card to Appa.

461
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:29,067
Very good Savitri

462
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:30,108
Thank you Sir..

463
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:31,698
Sir should I drink water?

464
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,910
Yes.. Today's rehearsal was good.

465
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:38,953
Tomorrow we will do rehearsal
for more time. Now go home.

466
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:39,955
Ok leave..

467
00:38:43,076 --> 00:38:44,207
Savi..

468
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:46,078
Enjoy today.

469
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:48,290
Come Savi it's late.

470
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,420
If we are late one
day nothing happens!

471
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,211
Bye

472
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,082
Lets go.

473
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:54,673
Come on.
- Come.

474
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,875
Meet you all tomorrow..

475
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,338
Savi..

476
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,471
You came late

477
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:09,883
Yes little bit

478
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:11,683
From tomorrow onwards
come straight home after school

479
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:13,225
and call me at the
office as you reach.

480
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,138
Rehearsals are going on
in school for the annual day.

481
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:20,560
No excuse Savi this is final.

482
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,812
I come everyday on time,
because of rehearsals I am late.

483
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,523
Have you taken my permission
before participating in the dance?

484
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:29,355
Am I small now?

485
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:31,696
You have not grown
up yet to take decisions.

486
00:39:33,027 --> 00:39:34,778
What should I tell sir?

487
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,991
Tell him I cannot
participate in the dance.

488
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:40,992
How can you say that?

489
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,955
I cannot tell him
this at the last moment

490
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:46,115
and I want to do it.

491
00:39:46,205 --> 00:39:48,497
Savi, don't talk to me in that tone

492
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:50,458
Then even you cannot
talk to me in that tone.

493
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:52,460
Savi shut up and go to your room.
I am working.

494
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,120
Even I am not sitting ideal.

495
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,501
If you want me to go I will go..

496
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,333
If you ever shout
at me I will not listen.

497
00:39:57,413 --> 00:39:59,043
If you will shout once,
then I will shout louder ten times.

498
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:00,545
Savi shut up and get out of here me

499
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,455
I will not..

500
00:40:01,995 --> 00:40:03,747
You always corner everyone.

501
00:40:03,827 --> 00:40:04,707
I am just not going to
Listen to everything you say..

502
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:05,918
You always just make direct judgement

503
00:40:06,118 --> 00:40:06,868
Savi

504
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:08,960
No. And what have I done?

505
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,871
Murdered anyone or stolen anything?

506
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:13,423
why should I give you
every minutes calculation?

507
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:16,005
Do you tell me what
time what things you do?

508
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,336
Did you even inform
me before re-marrying?

509
00:40:20,427 --> 00:40:23,468
By blaming anyone we
cannot prove our point Appa.

510
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,551
You must be feeling that
I will behave as you ask me to..

511
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:27,682
but that will not happen.

512
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,843
I will not take any injustice
happening to me Appa ?

513
00:40:31,885 --> 00:40:35,937
Appa every time things
will not happen as you want,

514
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,731
I will not follow your rules.

515
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:45,523
I'll do what I want..

516
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:51,897
She has no manners left..
She has become rude and careless..

517
00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:54,358
need to teach her a lesson.

518
00:40:55,238 --> 00:40:59,111
Leave it.. stay calm.

519
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:00,362
How should I stay calm?

520
00:41:00,953 --> 00:41:03,113
Does it look good
to hit a grown up girl?

521
00:41:03,363 --> 00:41:05,575
Then she should think before talking.

522
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:07,747
How was she talking?

523
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:13,580
When someone scolds a child of this age
in front of servants they feel insulted.

524
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,831
Let her feel..

525
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:17,543
She's forgotten how
to speak with elders.

526
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:19,333
Sometimes she should be punished

527
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:22,126
and you don't fall
in middle of all this.

528
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:26,628
She comes on time every
day and does all things in time.

529
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:27,670
She's very smart.

530
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,762
Yes... I can see her smartness.
Her tongue is losing control.

531
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:36,805
If she's misbehaving then why is she
misbehaving you should find the reason?

532
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:37,765
aha!

533
00:41:38,015 --> 00:41:42,058
She does her studies with dancing,
so then what's the problem?

534
00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:45,060
Don't fight with me
by taking her side Amala.

535
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,142
But you said this
yesterday to Mokashi.

536
00:41:48,232 --> 00:41:48,773
Huh!

537
00:41:48,813 --> 00:41:51,985
We should hear the
other side of the story too

538
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:12,195
you have beautiful hair.
Take care of them properly.

539
00:43:13,615 --> 00:43:15,827
This is the only good thing you have.

540
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:31,086
John keep this bag in the car.

541
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:38,751
After school come directly
home don't break the rules.

542
00:44:05,648 --> 00:44:06,768
John give me water

543
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:33,875
I had only this best thing in me.

544
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:36,838
Now I don't even have that.

545
00:44:38,128 --> 00:44:40,670
At least I have the
right to decide that?

546
00:44:43,922 --> 00:44:46,133
You are impossible...

547
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:50,216
Impossible

548
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:59,051
I will not do anything
that will make you happy Appa.

549
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:16,813
Whispering reading her books

550
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:19,233
Eh ...are they going to catch you?

551
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:23,026
And what do you get by shifting the
placing of the pots from here to there Ammi?

552
00:45:30,701 --> 00:45:34,663
Not me... but they feel better so I do

553
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:46,631
"Different Parts are
different in our eyes."

554
00:45:54,256 --> 00:46:01,720
"Different Parts are
different in our eyes."

555
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:08,935
"Why we do not have the
bond between you and me."

556
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:16,730
"Who is beyond this moment?"

557
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:24,355
"Who is beyond this moment?"

558
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:37,033
"Avoid getting involved
in what to say"

559
00:46:38,073 --> 00:46:46,498
"Avoid getting involved
in what to say"

560
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:54,373
"Why do I have to
follow along with you?"

561
00:46:55,214 --> 00:47:02,178
"Why do I have to
follow along with you?"

562
00:47:09,803 --> 00:47:12,305
That's Ammi my new mother

563
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:28,895
"There were many doubts
and questions in my mind"

564
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:40,242
"There were many doubts
and questions in my mind"

565
00:47:40,993 --> 00:47:47,827
"Why do I find my
answers in your eyes!"

566
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:55,832
"Why do I find my
answers in your eyes!"

567
00:47:56,252 --> 00:48:02,966
"I think it's different to me"

568
00:48:03,877 --> 00:48:10,921
"I think it's different to me"
- Ammi..Lets go

569
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:21,888
"By which relation
I am involved with you?"

570
00:48:22,928 --> 00:48:29,683
"Who do I have to
follow along with you?"

571
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:47,285
Yes.. Savi has done great work..

572
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,365
No I was not able to
give much attention to her,

573
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:52,117
but she came first in her board
exams so she must have studied hard.

574
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:56,870
ya ya...
yes.. After all she's my child.

575
00:48:58,541 --> 00:48:59,502
Yes..right..right.

576
00:49:00,873 --> 00:49:02,623
Okay..okay... I will tell her.

577
00:49:02,793 --> 00:49:04,625
Ya.. ya..ya.. Thank you!

578
00:49:07,837 --> 00:49:08,548
Yes

579
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,800
Are you busy?

580
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,381
Yes a little bit

581
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:17,963
You scored good marks I am very happy.

582
00:49:19,305 --> 00:49:20,175
Really?

583
00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:24,177
Of course! Tell me what gift you want?

584
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,270
Look..

585
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:31,772
look..properly..

586
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,063
How's my photo?

587
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:34,853
Nice

588
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:38,936
Thank you!

589
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,318
But I have everything.

590
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,028
I don't want anything.

591
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,400
I am asking you with my whole heart

592
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:48,112
I too am telling
you with my whole heart

593
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:53,946
Okay.. What you want to do ahead?

594
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:56,327
About what?

595
00:49:56,738 --> 00:50:00,790
Means I feel that you should do
graduation in law and should join our firm.

596
00:50:04,443 --> 00:50:05,113
Why?

597
00:50:05,323 --> 00:50:07,115
Everything is already set that's why

598
00:50:07,695 --> 00:50:09,576
But if I don't want to do law then

599
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:11,537
Then what do you want to do?

600
00:50:12,198 --> 00:50:13,288
I will tell you when the time comes

601
00:50:14,118 --> 00:50:16,500
Nobody gets such a ready set up Savi

602
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:20,453
I am not interested
in becoming a lawyer

603
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,123
and earning money on
other people's problems.

604
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,756
I would rather love
to solve their problems.

605
00:50:37,303 --> 00:50:37,843
okay

606
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:09,113
Ammi are you sleeping?

607
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:12,155
I want to give you a surprise..

608
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:15,787
Ammi I want to show
you my best student trophy

609
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:18,368
What happened? Haan?

610
00:51:28,705 --> 00:51:29,496
Sorry..

611
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:32,418
sorry to disturb you..

612
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,418
I did not know that you
arrived from your tour...

613
00:51:34,498 --> 00:51:35,710
or else I would have not come.

614
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,170
Now you came to know!

615
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:39,882
Then why are you
standing here go inside?

616
00:51:48,348 --> 00:51:50,598
Didn't even realize and
college days are over too

617
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:53,971
Guys! Wedding cards have arrived..

618
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,012
Congrats

619
00:51:55,102 --> 00:51:55,722
Thank you!

620
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:56,683
Neha I want a party

621
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:57,683
Of course yes!

622
00:51:57,763 --> 00:51:58,513
Yes we want party

623
00:51:58,603 --> 00:51:59,105
Tell this to aunty too

624
00:51:59,185 --> 00:51:59,935
Yes

625
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:03,397
and Shweta if you give me
any excuses then you wait and watch

626
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:04,068
No yaar

627
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:06,689
ofcourse you are the first one
who is getting married from our group.

628
00:52:06,769 --> 00:52:07,520
Everyone will come.

629
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,440
Thank you!
- Yes

630
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,821
We all will come

631
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:13,823
What happened to you?

632
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:16,275
Yesterday everything was messed up

633
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:17,866
Now what?

634
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:21,948
I went to Ammi's room to
show her my best student trophy..

635
00:52:22,158 --> 00:52:23,530
but she was not opening the door

636
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,911
and guess who opened the door?

637
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:26,832
Who?

638
00:52:27,162 --> 00:52:28,203
My Appa.

639
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:33,746
Looking at their situation
I felt I had disturbed them.

640
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:37,288
Appa nearly shouted at me.

641
00:52:37,998 --> 00:52:40,380
You people don't talk
normally to each other.

642
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,290
Means?

643
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:45,633
Means you people talk to each
other either arrogantly or rudely.

644
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:49,215
Can't help!
Its in our blood, can't change it now.

645
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:55,260
Savi it's been 17 to 18
years your mother passed away

646
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,140
yes

647
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:59,512
It's a long time Yaar.
Your Appa must be feeling lonely.

648
00:52:59,602 --> 00:53:01,183
I don't know whether
he's feeling lonely or not,

649
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:03,475
but a person needs physical touch.

650
00:53:03,935 --> 00:53:07,857
But your Ammi is young, then
why she got married to your father?

651
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:10,729
I think she likes father figure...

652
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:14,862
means she must be finding
father's love in Appa in every way

653
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,483
physical and emotional.

654
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:20,065
oh! means at your home
"Cheeni Kum" is going on?

655
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:23,817
I am leaving now..
I am getting late. Bye Bye.

656
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:24,408
Bye

657
00:53:24,488 --> 00:53:25,818
Neha madam let us
know about the party.

658
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:26,408
Sure!

659
00:53:26,488 --> 00:53:26,870
Bye

660
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:27,780
Bye

661
00:53:30,411 --> 00:53:33,873
Savi, what was the need
to discuss the relationship

662
00:53:33,913 --> 00:53:36,035
of your Ammi and Appa
in front of everyone?

663
00:53:37,075 --> 00:53:39,417
They don't feel shy about anything?
Why should I feel shy?

664
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,538
But why did you enter their room?

665
00:53:41,748 --> 00:53:42,920
How would I know?

666
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,921
If so, then they should have
put a board of "Do not Disturb"

667
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:47,792
Oh!! okay.. Okay..

668
00:53:49,883 --> 00:53:53,886
Take this invitation card
and invite your family too

669
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:56,258
Neha..

670
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:56,968
Yes..

671
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:00,140
You know why you are getting married?

672
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:02,091
Means?

673
00:54:03,342 --> 00:54:05,723
Means there is something wrong
with our institution of marriage

674
00:54:06,263 --> 00:54:06,895
what?

675
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:12,098
Means.. see na before understanding what
we truly want, we rush to give others.

676
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:15,560
arre we need to self analyze what
we want first.. then give to others

677
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:20,153
Savi you don't confuse
me unnecessarily?

678
00:54:21,353 --> 00:54:23,985
and Sandeep is very caring

679
00:54:24,235 --> 00:54:25,986
Caring means is he boring?

680
00:54:26,236 --> 00:54:28,818
Hey Savi...please...
I have made my decision to get married

681
00:54:28,908 --> 00:54:29,448
Sure?

682
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:30,158
Yes..

683
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:30,950
Okay

684
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,031
I will get married to Sandeep
and get settled in Mumbai.

685
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:36,073
Are you happy?

686
00:54:36,613 --> 00:54:36,953
Yes

687
00:54:37,743 --> 00:54:38,915
Then I am happy for you too

688
00:54:40,165 --> 00:54:40,745
Come

689
00:54:40,825 --> 00:54:41,826
Come

690
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,708
Now come with me for shopping..

691
00:54:44,788 --> 00:54:47,080
Please Neha no shopping and all

692
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:09,933
John...

693
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:13,095
John...

694
00:55:14,386 --> 00:55:17,018
remove the suitcases from the loft;
I am going to Mumbai.

695
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,730
What are you saying?

696
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:31,948
I am going to Mumbai
for further studies.

697
00:55:32,238 --> 00:55:33,948
You're asking me or telling me?

698
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,200
nah?

699
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:40,993
And before applying you did
not think it was important to ask me?

700
00:55:41,903 --> 00:55:43,905
Would you have spoken
something different?

701
00:55:44,955 --> 00:55:47,958
That's why I decided to
inform you after the confirmation.

702
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:50,579
I am not saying no
for further studies,

703
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,910
but is it necessary to go to Mumbai?

704
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:54,661
You can complete
your studies here also.

705
00:55:55,963 --> 00:55:58,083
I want to do research in Mumbai

706
00:55:59,215 --> 00:56:02,256
and as I have received fellowship, there
is no need for you to take care of me.

707
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:06,168
Till I am alive I will
fulfill all your needs.

708
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,590
Are you going to feed me life long?

709
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:12,763
50 to 60 years is
a very dangerous period

710
00:56:14,013 --> 00:56:17,636
I suppose now a days its said
that after 50 anything can happen

711
00:56:17,926 --> 00:56:18,596
Savi

712
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:22,388
and Appa I don't want to stay here

713
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:29,023
why are you not thinking
of getting married?

714
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:33,025
means you have anyone who
is special from your friends group?

715
00:56:33,276 --> 00:56:34,777
I don't want to get married

716
00:56:35,988 --> 00:56:36,988
then what do you want to do?

717
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:40,240
I think it's the proper
age to get married now,

718
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,192
as it's the perfect
time to get married now.

719
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:46,945
1 Minute

720
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:49,746
have you done any work on time?

721
00:56:51,077 --> 00:56:53,448
To put braces on my
teeth John came with me.

722
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,540
The family doctor gave
me knowledge about periods.

723
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:58,752
And, to buy my bra
the stenographer came with me.

724
00:56:59,122 --> 00:57:00,913
All the facts of life I have
learnt from books and knowledge

725
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:02,835
about pills I learnt
from Femina magazine..

726
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,206
and in all this where were you Appa?

727
00:57:05,626 --> 00:57:07,958
You were roaming from
one city to another.

728
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:12,210
I grew on my own...
how were you involved during my growing years?

729
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,012
How dare you talk like this?

730
00:57:15,592 --> 00:57:18,675
Why don't you accept that
you know nothing about me?

731
00:57:19,425 --> 00:57:22,056
If you are going to behave like this
then I don't even want to understand you.

732
00:57:22,927 --> 00:57:24,218
that will be better

733
00:57:25,638 --> 00:57:27,600
and why you wanted
information about the pills?

734
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,892
how could you be so old fashioned?

735
00:57:33,273 --> 00:57:35,225
I care about you so I am asking

736
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:36,685
Really?

737
00:57:36,815 --> 00:57:37,396
Of course

738
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:41,438
This means you don't have faith
on my competence and my intelligence.

739
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,690
And Yes

740
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:49,483
Because the person who often says I care
for you actually has a superiority complex.

741
00:57:51,485 --> 00:57:54,697
They often feel that how
will others live without them

742
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:59,700
No.. No.. you are talking nonsense..

743
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:02,081
we can't have a conversation like this

744
00:58:02,201 --> 00:58:02,952
that's right.

745
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,453
We can't stand each other..

746
00:58:05,703 --> 00:58:08,585
so let me go... I am going to Mumbai

747
00:58:10,456 --> 00:58:11,667
then go to hell..

748
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:13,798
Do what ever you want..

749
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,591
Don't show your face to me again!

750
00:58:55,985 --> 00:58:56,655
Hey Savi..

751
00:58:57,866 --> 00:58:58,697
Hi!

752
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,158
I am Sandeep speaking...

753
00:59:00,618 --> 00:59:01,868
Neha is in the kitchen

754
00:59:02,118 --> 00:59:02,740
Neha..

755
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,450
yes

756
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:07,743
Hello.. Say

757
00:59:07,993 --> 00:59:10,374
Neha, why did Sandeep
answer your call?

758
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:14,747
Savi, let it be, you say

759
00:59:15,087 --> 00:59:16,088
my admission is done

760
00:59:16,128 --> 00:59:20,750
Wow! What are you saying!
But how did Appa agree?

761
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,925
Yes! He was not ready. But where
do I listen to him? And this time I won!

762
00:59:27,715 --> 00:59:31,427
I said I am going and this is final

763
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,852
Its useless talking to her

764
00:59:39,512 --> 00:59:40,643
No... no...no

765
00:59:40,723 --> 00:59:43,725
I cant tolerate this

766
00:59:44,225 --> 00:59:45,476
Let her go...

767
00:59:45,726 --> 00:59:52,980
What will she do in Mumbai without me

768
00:59:54,481 --> 00:59:56,653
All her efforts will be futile;

769
00:59:57,273 --> 00:59:59,565
after she goes there

770
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,820
No... no I will not see her face

771
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,281
Let her do what ever she wants

772
01:00:11,072 --> 01:00:16,245
Yes after fifteen days
I will be in the hostel

773
01:00:16,575 --> 01:00:19,167
Why hostel? You stay with us.

774
01:00:19,247 --> 01:00:19,708
Yes

775
01:00:19,918 --> 01:00:20,878
Hmmm

776
01:00:21,378 --> 01:00:24,380
No.. You would not be
able to bear me for more days

777
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:27,042
when are you leaving?

778
01:00:27,462 --> 01:00:28,133
tomorrow

779
01:00:28,213 --> 01:00:32,175
great! Then bring your letter, mark
sheet and certificates along with you.

780
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:33,966
yes.. I will bring.

781
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:35,758
And call as you leave.

782
01:00:36,218 --> 01:00:39,340
Yes.. will do.. should i keep
the call.. I want to pack my bags.

783
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,971
okay take care.

784
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:42,181
Bye!
- Bye!

785
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:47,345
Savi...

786
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:48,095
hmm

787
01:00:49,726 --> 01:00:50,937
Why are you going?
You are going tomorrow itself?

788
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,188
Really! Yes why?

789
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:56,230
what has happened?
You are going in such a hurry

790
01:00:57,401 --> 01:00:59,062
Appa has sent you?

791
01:00:59,562 --> 01:01:00,193
No.

792
01:01:01,733 --> 01:01:03,355
He didn't have his food properly.

793
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:06,156
Now I saw him,
he was talking to himself.

794
01:01:08,158 --> 01:01:13,161
Means I have done it.
That's what I wanted.

795
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:18,495
Actually I didn't understand properly
when you'll were fighting in english...

796
01:01:20,665 --> 01:01:21,826
but .. Should I ask you something?

797
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:23,918
Ask..

798
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:26,369
Why don't you get married?

799
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,331
Ammi please you don't start now

800
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:34,003
It's not like that.
You are beautiful, smart,

801
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,045
educated...

802
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:40,258
you have everything

803
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,720
and you have such good friends.

804
01:01:45,131 --> 01:01:49,723
Wow! By looking at your happy married
life I am not eager to get married.

805
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:03,693
Savi look I don't know what kind of
relationship you and your dad have..

806
01:02:04,023 --> 01:02:05,733
Why you behave like this with him?

807
01:02:05,813 --> 01:02:07,525
Why you get angry with him?

808
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:09,566
He is right or wrong?

809
01:02:10,487 --> 01:02:13,398
I don't know and I don't
want to interfere in it,

810
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,743
but how his attitude
is with me is our look out.

811
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:24,745
On this I wouldn't want you to ever
talk about our relationship ever with me.

812
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:29,538
You don't have that right.

813
01:02:34,962 --> 01:02:36,253
Then from now onwards even you have

814
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,213
no right to interfere
in any of my matters of life.

815
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:39,165
Understood

816
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:42,216
Don't come again to
ask about what's going on.

817
01:02:43,047 --> 01:02:46,128
Correct! It's my mistake.

818
01:03:25,253 --> 01:03:28,215
Savitari sister when
will you come back?

819
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:31,758
First let me go then
we will see when I return.

820
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:34,600
Sister are you going to meet Sir?

821
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,012
No..Someone must
have come to see him..

822
01:03:39,102 --> 01:03:40,433
so he must be busy...

823
01:03:40,803 --> 01:03:41,933
I don't want to disturb him...

824
01:03:58,525 --> 01:03:59,365
Lets go

825
01:04:00,235 --> 01:04:01,866
I left that house.

826
01:04:02,316 --> 01:04:05,158
Actually I want to
study further in Mumbai,

827
01:04:05,238 --> 01:04:07,160
but really I didn't
want to leave that house.

828
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:11,202
I argued with Appa,
just to win this fight.

829
01:04:18,497 --> 01:04:24,250
When I was in Kolhapur I had only gone
out for school trips and college study tours.

830
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:31,635
In such a crowded city like Mumbai I
know only two people Neha and Sandeep.

831
01:04:32,926 --> 01:04:36,588
Adjusting in this new
city was a big task for me.

832
01:04:47,345 --> 01:04:51,558
Slowly and steadily
I started loving this city.

833
01:04:52,648 --> 01:04:55,730
I started enjoying Independence,
loneliness.

834
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:04,025
The next two years I studied sincerely
I came first in M.Sc University.

835
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:10,360
and then I joined my favorite National research
institute as a junior research fellow.

836
01:05:14,322 --> 01:05:16,863
I got lost in my work and studies.

837
01:05:20,165 --> 01:05:23,708
and I was able to afford
small luxuries of life.

838
01:05:25,418 --> 01:05:28,080
I feel only when we
are finally independent

839
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,793
are we able to take the right
decisions and responsibilities.

840
01:05:32,923 --> 01:05:37,296
During this period I never
went back home or wrote any letters.

841
01:05:38,507 --> 01:05:40,548
Sometimes Appa used to call me,

842
01:05:41,428 --> 01:05:43,720
as he was worried about me.

843
01:06:01,351 --> 01:06:01,941
Hello!

844
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:03,983
Hello!

845
01:06:04,563 --> 01:06:06,315
How are you?
How is everything going on?

846
01:06:06,645 --> 01:06:08,315
Appa, there are two good news.

847
01:06:08,946 --> 01:06:09,486
Yes,

848
01:06:09,776 --> 01:06:11,488
I have got an International fellowship.

849
01:06:11,648 --> 01:06:13,778
Wow! And the second?

850
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:15,780
I took a rented house in Mumbai.

851
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,951
It is Neha's uncles.

852
01:06:18,282 --> 01:06:20,993
He stays in U.S.
I got it at nominal rent.

853
01:06:21,453 --> 01:06:23,155
Means now you will never come back.

854
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,366
You felt that I would come back?

855
01:06:28,788 --> 01:06:30,410
Ah! Should I send you some money?

856
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:30,960
No.

857
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,120
Incase you need?

858
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:32,751
No.

859
01:06:33,371 --> 01:06:36,543
Appa someone is calling me
I will talk to you later. - Okay then

860
01:06:38,335 --> 01:06:39,085
Hello...

861
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:52,513
If she doesn't want to extend
the topic she cuts the call like this.

862
01:07:31,287 --> 01:07:31,998
Neha

863
01:07:32,038 --> 01:07:32,748
Ya say..

864
01:07:32,998 --> 01:07:35,450
Where are you? I called you two times.

865
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,951
I came na

866
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:39,292
come

867
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:41,753
So did you like the house?

868
01:07:42,455 --> 01:07:44,005
I cant decide anything

869
01:07:46,006 --> 01:07:47,087
why are you laughing?

870
01:07:48,008 --> 01:07:48,838
nothing at all ...

871
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:50,630
you looking like appa...

872
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,840
very funny

873
01:07:53,761 --> 01:07:56,593
I can't handle this...Please
help me set this house.

874
01:07:57,263 --> 01:07:58,014
What?

875
01:08:00,766 --> 01:08:02,016
What did you say?

876
01:08:02,677 --> 01:08:06,930
Means...we together&#xa0;set this house.
I'll help you

877
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,891
Yes that's&#xa0;better!

878
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:15,475
How do you work in an institute?
You can't even set up a house

879
01:08:15,565 --> 01:08:19,938
Don't act smart. I am giving
you a chance to show your creativity.

880
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:21,028
Hmm

881
01:08:21,278 --> 01:08:22,650
should I call Sandeep?

882
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,901
No..No...As he will come he
will start giving instructions...

883
01:08:26,282 --> 01:08:28,903
use proper saving bulb.
Have you closed the Tap?

884
01:08:28,983 --> 01:08:30,195
Put stopper on the door,

885
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:34,697
and I am not in any mood to listen
to any kind of instructions now.

886
01:08:34,787 --> 01:08:35,448
Okay.

887
01:08:36,328 --> 01:08:40,621
Lets do one thing; You open the
boxes... I will start from the kitchen..

888
01:08:40,911 --> 01:08:43,333
Yes here I come..

889
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,048
Yes...Yes I have finished my work.
Yes....I am leaving

890
01:08:53,128 --> 01:08:53,918
I am not a taxi

891
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:55,670
Coming

892
01:08:56,671 --> 01:08:58,422
You completed setting up the home..

893
01:09:02,255 --> 01:09:04,966
I love you.. Thank you so much..

894
01:09:05,176 --> 01:09:06,507
Enough. Don't become emotional.

895
01:09:06,637 --> 01:09:08,718
I am leaving now.
Sandeep is waiting for me.

896
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:11,600
and have made tea and kept in the kitchen..
I will bring the food at night.

897
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,430
We will have it together.

898
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:13,061
Okay

899
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:13,811
Bye

900
01:09:32,823 --> 01:09:33,773
Welcome

901
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:38,076
Take water

902
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,951
but I haven't asked for water.

903
01:09:46,702 --> 01:09:51,165
I had asked for it by the
way this is my friend Ram from Nagpur

904
01:09:53,207 --> 01:09:55,038
and she's my friend Savi

905
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:56,038
Hi

906
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:56,748
Hello

907
01:09:56,838 --> 01:09:59,790
Do you want to say Hi and Hellos here..
or shall we&#xa0;go inside the house and chat too?

908
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,421
Ya

909
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:02,883
Sandeep at least see
how I have set the house.

910
01:10:02,963 --> 01:10:03,543
hmm

911
01:10:08,756 --> 01:10:11,218
Savi you have changed
everything that I had placed?

912
01:10:11,758 --> 01:10:14,050
Neha you had set
everything so typically.

913
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,931
I was not feeling that great.

914
01:10:16,351 --> 01:10:18,432
You had placed everything
very obviously.

915
01:10:19,223 --> 01:10:21,103
For example Now see here
there is such a good window..

916
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:23,515
why sit facing with your back?

917
01:10:23,896 --> 01:10:26,437
You need to keep watch on
everyone who is going and coming

918
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:29,940
but isn't my comfort more
important in my own house?

919
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,312
For people who are visiting
why should I ruin my convenience?

920
01:10:34,062 --> 01:10:36,233
Guest should also do
some kind of adjustment.

921
01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:42,157
and I had kept the
book shelf inside na ?

922
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:43,738
Again same.

923
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:48,571
Incase while I am having food or
coffee; if I feel like reading a book...

924
01:10:48,821 --> 01:10:50,573
the book shelf should be near me?

925
01:10:51,073 --> 01:10:53,995
At last... You will do how u feel..

926
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:55,876
I have not changed too much...

927
01:10:56,076 --> 01:10:58,037
Look at the curtains
I haven't changed them..

928
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,878
I have kept the television
where you had kept it

929
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:03,000
ya

930
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:06,292
because it's the right place so..

931
01:11:06,713 --> 01:11:09,835
You are angry Neha?

932
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:12,586
No

933
01:11:16,218 --> 01:11:17,180
What's this?

934
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,142
You cooked the food yourself

935
01:11:21,182 --> 01:11:22,092
Hmm

936
01:11:22,142 --> 01:11:22,723
Means what?

937
01:11:22,803 --> 01:11:24,053
She liked the house matter finished

938
01:11:24,143 --> 01:11:28,096
You came for me leaving everything..
You set my house...

939
01:11:29,187 --> 01:11:30,437
One dinner treat I can give you na

940
01:11:32,438 --> 01:11:33,600
You also naa

941
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:37,021

942
01:11:37,102 --> 01:11:37,692
Come

943
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:38,442
Lets go

944
01:11:38,853 --> 01:11:39,233
Lets go

945
01:11:39,313 --> 01:11:40,103
Lets eat

946
01:11:43,695 --> 01:11:44,196
Thank you!

947
01:11:45,777 --> 01:11:46,237
Take this

948
01:11:46,357 --> 01:11:47,158
Thank you!

949
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:48,158
Take this..

950
01:11:48,858 --> 01:11:51,821
Arre Ram! I didn't even ask
you for Water. Just chatted away.

951
01:11:51,911 --> 01:11:52,531
You want water?

952
01:11:52,611 --> 01:11:52,991
It's okay

953
01:11:53,072 --> 01:11:55,953
Take it na.. Be comfortable

954
01:11:56,413 --> 01:11:57,165
Wait...

955
01:11:57,745 --> 01:11:59,785
Ram, Jaundice is in the air...
here have mineral water.

956
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:02,207
She has still not installed
the water purifier...

957
01:12:02,668 --> 01:12:03,828
you install it first...

958
01:12:04,368 --> 01:12:06,210
and the main door also
does not have the safety chain;

959
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,581
and when we were coming the security
guard was not at his place and...

960
01:12:08,711 --> 01:12:13,043
Sandeep, it's not necessary that everything
should be observed today and discussed.

961
01:12:13,123 --> 01:12:14,295
Yes! That's what.

962
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:17,296
You prepare a list of work and I will make
sure everything is done by tomorrow.

963
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:17,837
Yes

964
01:12:19,218 --> 01:12:19,628
Take

965
01:12:21,178 --> 01:12:23,220
So Ram? What do you do?

966
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:24,881
I am in IT

967
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:29,555
Oh? And whom do you follow then?
Narayan Murthy or Bill Gates

968
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:30,595
Rahul Dravid

969
01:12:32,095 --> 01:12:34,517
Really! You like cricket?

970
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:35,598
I love cricket.

971
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,480
I have bunked my office
and watched World Cup matches.

972
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:40,771
Whom do you like?

973
01:12:42,602 --> 01:12:43,853
The person who wins the match.

974
01:12:44,983 --> 01:12:46,235
Of course!

975
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,776
I don't just like
Dravid as a cricketer

976
01:12:49,026 --> 01:12:50,447
but also as an idol.

977
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:53,820
He has earned so much,

978
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:55,240
but the younger generation
should not get affected.

979
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,073
He has rejected so many advertisements
and even now he is not running for money.

980
01:13:00,153 --> 01:13:02,365
He is training the
under 19 cricket team.

981
01:13:02,865 --> 01:13:04,406
Yes

982
01:13:04,656 --> 01:13:05,867
He has actually proven

983
01:13:06,117 --> 01:13:07,788
that in cricket or in life,

984
01:13:08,248 --> 01:13:10,830
form can be temporary...
Class is permanent.

985
01:13:13,331 --> 01:13:14,252
True

986
01:13:16,873 --> 01:13:17,875
Dessert is left inside

987
01:13:18,045 --> 01:13:18,875
I'll come..

988
01:13:25,008 --> 01:13:28,971
Ram how's our Savi?

989
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:33,424
She's completely different.
Does not fit in any formula

990
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:38,768
Miss Savitri

991
01:13:39,678 --> 01:13:41,228
University Gold Medalist.

992
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,893
If you must be feeling
that I have selected..

993
01:13:47,643 --> 01:13:50,025
..you as a PhD student
then you are mistaken.

994
01:13:51,105 --> 01:13:55,108
Actually there is a long queue of PhD
students outside my door to meet me.

995
01:13:55,568 --> 01:13:57,318
Sir I have nothing to say.

996
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,742
I just feel you have
to look at the draft papers.

997
01:14:02,322 --> 01:14:07,325
Means... I will come to know
if I am on the right track or no?

998
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,537
If you would be on
the wrong track then?

999
01:14:11,328 --> 01:14:14,790
Are you going to change the subjects?

1000
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,751
Sir don't misunderstand me

1001
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,913
if I am on the wrong
track then I need to decide

1002
01:14:20,003 --> 01:14:22,005
what I am working
on for 10 to 12 hours now

1003
01:14:22,085 --> 01:14:24,086
How much more time shall
I invest to become better?

1004
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:27,008
I mean will I reach
what I have to achieve?

1005
01:14:28,008 --> 01:14:28,958
What's the hurry?

1006
01:14:29,419 --> 01:14:31,840
By today or day after tomorrow
we are going to work...

1007
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,172
...on the project of dengue
vaccination design model

1008
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:38,175
No Sir. This work has to be
done quickly only then a company...

1009
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:40,806
...will prepare this vaccine
and it can reach to the common people.

1010
01:14:41,557 --> 01:14:44,058
I am ready to work
on this 24 hours a day.

1011
01:14:44,518 --> 01:14:49,602
Miss Savitri, Research is
not a recipe to be tried instantly

1012
01:14:49,682 --> 01:14:54,395
I know Sir,
but we need to start somewhere

1013
01:14:54,605 --> 01:14:55,315
Yes

1014
01:14:56,026 --> 01:14:57,607
I know where I have to go...

1015
01:14:57,777 --> 01:14:59,318
How to go you will suggest?

1016
01:15:01,318 --> 01:15:03,280
Please Sir take a look at the papers

1017
01:15:04,191 --> 01:15:07,323
and then decide should I send
them to the international journal.

1018
01:15:10,235 --> 01:15:11,285
Thank you

1019
01:15:47,508 --> 01:15:48,308
Sorry...

1020
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:50,470
Hi..

1021
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,310
Hi..

1022
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,601
How come you are here?

1023
01:15:53,101 --> 01:15:53,892
Just like you

1024
01:15:54,312 --> 01:15:55,143
Please sit

1025
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:02,017
Don't tell me.. You are sitting
here and watching Bollywood movies.

1026
01:16:02,898 --> 01:16:03,438
yes

1027
01:16:04,608 --> 01:16:08,821
A smart boy like you, who's working
in IT, how can you watch Hindi movies?

1028
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:10,653
why

1029
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:15,075
Is it written somewhere
a person working in IT...

1030
01:16:15,775 --> 01:16:20,328
..should not watch Hindi movies
and who Knows may be I am on smart..

1031
01:16:21,278 --> 01:16:23,030
Yes it can be

1032
01:16:26,703 --> 01:16:28,333
sorry, sorry

1033
01:16:29,243 --> 01:16:29,875
coffee?

1034
01:16:30,165 --> 01:16:30,625
Yes..

1035
01:16:33,587 --> 01:16:34,668
Excuse me!

1036
01:16:36,288 --> 01:16:36,998
Yes ma'am

1037
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,590
One black coffee

1038
01:16:40,131 --> 01:16:41,091
One filter coffee

1039
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:41,792
Sure

1040
01:16:42,002 --> 01:16:42,753
I will bring it to the table

1041
01:16:42,883 --> 01:16:43,253
OK

1042
01:16:43,343 --> 01:16:43,883
Thank you!

1043
01:16:44,093 --> 01:16:44,713
Have a seat. I will come..

1044
01:16:44,793 --> 01:16:45,294
Ok

1045
01:16:57,472 --> 01:16:59,723
Every day after office
what to do at home?

1046
01:17:00,143 --> 01:17:01,103
Where to go?

1047
01:17:01,765 --> 01:17:06,608
So I come here..
Watch movies and I don't miss my home.

1048
01:17:07,018 --> 01:17:09,440
Oh my! You have become
suddenly so sentimental

1049
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,941
not exactly like that,

1050
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:14,482
but when we stay
alone we miss our homes.

1051
01:17:14,613 --> 01:17:16,023
even miss Nagpur..

1052
01:17:16,653 --> 01:17:18,365
You also must be missing home
- Hold on ...

1053
01:17:19,155 --> 01:17:21,116
I don't miss my home..

1054
01:17:21,617 --> 01:17:23,658
and not even Kolhapur.

1055
01:17:24,568 --> 01:17:26,990
I myself took the
decision to come here..

1056
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,322
If you want to do something
different you need to pay for it

1057
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:35,625
and Ram in Mumbai outsiders
need to prove themselves.

1058
01:17:35,996 --> 01:17:38,417
Yes you are right

1059
01:17:39,038 --> 01:17:41,249
you can call me whenever you feel...

1060
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,080
Or else we can even meet...

1061
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,002
if I have time?

1062
01:17:50,965 --> 01:17:51,926
One minute...

1063
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:56,008
Hello.

1064
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,088
Hello Savi

1065
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:58,010
Yes say Aman..

1066
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,180
Have sent you the project..

1067
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,512
How will I see these heavy files?

1068
01:18:02,012 --> 01:18:03,303
I don't have my laptop right now..

1069
01:18:03,393 --> 01:18:05,143
Oh! Oh no!

1070
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:07,645
Thank you

1071
01:18:12,308 --> 01:18:13,400
yes.. say now

1072
01:18:18,853 --> 01:18:19,523
OK..

1073
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:32,321
No it is possible today...

1074
01:18:32,611 --> 01:18:35,363
Sandeep I don't think so anyone
will come now.. Come lets go...

1075
01:18:35,453 --> 01:18:36,323
I will call you later

1076
01:18:36,863 --> 01:18:39,075
Why are you doing this? Lets Wait
for 5 minutes or so then we will leave

1077
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:40,956
What ya

1078
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:43,578
Savi has not called
back since yesterday

1079
01:18:43,668 --> 01:18:44,328
Here comes

1080
01:18:44,578 --> 01:18:45,209
Sorry

1081
01:18:45,289 --> 01:18:46,960
Ram.. why the delay?

1082
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,751
I was waiting for Savi.

1083
01:18:48,961 --> 01:18:51,083
We were going to come together,
then she messaged me

1084
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:52,543
to go ahead and said
she will join later.

1085
01:18:53,043 --> 01:18:54,715
But why is she not answering my call?

1086
01:18:54,925 --> 01:18:55,585
She's busy.

1087
01:18:55,795 --> 01:18:56,586
Since yesterday?

1088
01:18:56,876 --> 01:18:59,258
Yes..She's working
on an important module...

1089
01:18:59,338 --> 01:18:59,838
Woah!

1090
01:19:00,178 --> 01:19:01,720
you know a lot about her

1091
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:08,513
she called me late night yesterday,
at that time she mentioned

1092
01:19:08,593 --> 01:19:10,435
Oh! And what else did she say?

1093
01:19:12,226 --> 01:19:14,347
Nothing else...She's coming here now.

1094
01:19:14,518 --> 01:19:15,888
She's coming now.. Oh! good..

1095
01:19:16,688 --> 01:19:19,020
She informed you, but not me?

1096
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:21,442
Ohhh!

1097
01:19:22,272 --> 01:19:23,103
Neha

1098
01:19:23,193 --> 01:19:25,735
Where have you been? What is this?

1099
01:19:26,025 --> 01:19:26,605
Shhh..

1100
01:19:27,145 --> 01:19:30,447
My papers have been accepted for
The International journal publication

1101
01:19:31,398 --> 01:19:32,988
OH!
- Wow! Congrats!!

1102
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:33,450
Thank you

1103
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:34,240
Congratulation!

1104
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:34,740
Thank you

1105
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:35,610
Congrats

1106
01:19:35,821 --> 01:19:36,491
Thank you

1107
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:38,493
Great!! lets have a party.
Lets go for dinner

1108
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:40,613
No. I need to go to the airport...

1109
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:43,245
Sir is going to Norway
I need to thank him.

1110
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:45,827
Are you going alone to the airport?

1111
01:19:45,907 --> 01:19:46,457
Yes

1112
01:19:46,498 --> 01:19:47,748
I'll go with her

1113
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:49,078
Is it, ok..

1114
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:49,870
yes Come, come

1115
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,371
I will call later

1116
01:19:52,461 --> 01:19:53,372
Bye

1117
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:57,003
Hey Savi check the taxi meter properly,
he could charge you for the night charges

1118
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,465
Sandeep you are nuts Oh what?

1119
01:19:59,665 --> 01:20:01,877
why are you worried
about the taxi meter?

1120
01:20:03,218 --> 01:20:05,260
What's in front of you look at that

1121
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,422
International airport

1122
01:20:10,382 --> 01:20:12,013
They together look very beautiful...

1123
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:15,725
We need not worry about Savi now

1124
01:20:16,386 --> 01:20:19,228
am worried about Ram, not Savi...

1125
01:20:20,428 --> 01:20:23,480
She's not so easy to handle.

1126
01:20:31,145 --> 01:20:31,735
Hi

1127
01:20:32,736 --> 01:20:33,527
Hi

1128
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,650
Nice flowers

1129
01:20:40,611 --> 01:20:41,442
You liked it?

1130
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:44,073
I like Tuberoses more

1131
01:20:47,495 --> 01:20:48,116
Next time.

1132
01:20:50,037 --> 01:20:51,618
I like your this attitude!

1133
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:53,700
people call this arrogance!

1134
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:55,831
I will call this honesty....

1135
01:20:58,162 --> 01:20:59,833
I am also called unpredictable...

1136
01:21:01,164 --> 01:21:04,296
then I will say your full of surprises!

1137
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,918
I don't think before i speak...

1138
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,590
we will call it straight forwardness.

1139
01:21:21,887 --> 01:21:25,099
Thank you! I like this.

1140
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:27,520
but I like you.

1141
01:21:28,181 --> 01:21:29,352
I like you too.

1142
01:21:29,602 --> 01:21:30,853
But I love you Savi.

1143
01:21:31,393 --> 01:21:32,353
I love you too.

1144
01:21:32,853 --> 01:21:34,225
Savi then we both - wait!

1145
01:21:35,816 --> 01:21:37,857
Ram I don't believe in some things.

1146
01:21:39,438 --> 01:21:42,530
We both love each other
and this feeling is enough for me.

1147
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,363
Savi do you want to solve all
of life math's now? And that too here?

1148
01:21:48,573 --> 01:21:52,236
no it's not like that, but there are some
things that need to be cleared before hand

1149
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:56,658
you are impossible Savi

1150
01:21:56,788 --> 01:21:57,990
Appa also tells the same thing,

1151
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:01,412
but his style of talking is different.

1152
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:06,415
and you if you want.. you
can take me closer.. you can

1153
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,881
and then we fell in love...

1154
01:22:17,712 --> 01:22:19,133
Ram was soft spoken..

1155
01:22:19,753 --> 01:22:23,345
passionate and happy..

1156
01:22:24,426 --> 01:22:26,217
anyone would feel fulfilled with him..

1157
01:22:27,308 --> 01:22:31,140
Neha would say that his eyes
were over flowing with love for me;

1158
01:22:35,263 --> 01:22:39,185
and as normal people behave
in love as a couple we two started..

1159
01:22:40,936 --> 01:22:42,648
Long conversations over the phone..

1160
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:46,570
Started roaming around..

1161
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:50,613
We slowly started meeting...

1162
01:22:52,693 --> 01:22:55,405
spending a lot of time together,

1163
01:22:57,367 --> 01:22:59,198
and later started sharing everything;

1164
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,701
even our bedroom.

1165
01:23:10,245 --> 01:23:11,666
No.. no no

1166
01:23:11,746 --> 01:23:14,378
I can't&#xa0;tell anything right now..

1167
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:16,628
are you listening what I am saying?

1168
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:18,250
geyser is not switched off

1169
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,290
go na quickly...

1170
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,841
Okay..first have tea

1171
01:23:21,342 --> 01:23:22,383
I will take a shower

1172
01:23:23,383 --> 01:23:24,713
will you go

1173
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:26,215
you go fast

1174
01:23:30,848 --> 01:23:32,258
Savi

1175
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:35,350
Savi
- ah!

1176
01:23:36,221 --> 01:23:37,852
with whom is ram talking?

1177
01:23:38,353 --> 01:23:39,053
don't know

1178
01:23:39,553 --> 01:23:40,433
then check

1179
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:43,646
Neha I don't like to do this

1180
01:23:44,106 --> 01:23:46,608
not like that...
I feel there's a problem...check

1181
01:23:47,728 --> 01:23:48,478
yes

1182
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:50,900
but, why?

1183
01:23:52,021 --> 01:23:52,651
may be

1184
01:23:55,443 --> 01:23:57,445
Savi you don't feel anything?

1185
01:23:57,735 --> 01:24:00,446
Neha, my attitude is
not to think about things...

1186
01:24:00,526 --> 01:24:02,488
..and then mull over it
and I don't even like doing it.

1187
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:03,988
You feel na..

1188
01:24:04,528 --> 01:24:07,410
Wait will ask ram what Ram is feeling
and if there's some problem ram..

1189
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:07,871
Huh..

1190
01:24:07,951 --> 01:24:11,453
Savi you are like killing
two birds with one stone..

1191
01:24:12,623 --> 01:24:15,916
at one go..
just have a look his face says it all

1192
01:24:16,626 --> 01:24:19,748
he will tell me when he wants to say.

1193
01:24:20,498 --> 01:24:22,670
We should not interfere
in anybody's privacy

1194
01:24:26,002 --> 01:24:27,883
and if he will not tell you?

1195
01:24:30,295 --> 01:24:32,296
then it would not
be of that importance.

1196
01:24:32,386 --> 01:24:33,887
I should understand that and leave it...

1197
01:24:41,932 --> 01:24:42,303
Hello

1198
01:24:42,393 --> 01:24:43,933
What..What?

1199
01:24:45,895 --> 01:24:48,896

say you are not taking it seriously

1200

1249
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:33,250
Heart attack..

I told him this age is dangerous..

1251
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:38,873
Anything can happen..

1252
01:27:39,753 --> 01:27:41,795
These things are in no ones hand..

1253
01:27:48,048 --> 01:27:49,380
Were you going out?

1265
01:28:16,396 --> 01:28:17,147
Heart attack..

1266
01:28:17,777 --> 01:28:18,778
OMG !!

1267
01:28:19,648 --> 01:28:20,398
when did this happen?

1268
01:28:20,779 --> 01:28:21,320
when?

1269
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,361
Aman I will call you later.

1270
01:28:26,783 --> 01:28:27,903
is this a way?

1271
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:31,866
my real father died
and no one informed me..

1272
01:28:33,237 --> 01:28:34,788
not even a phone call?

1273
01:28:36,288 --> 01:28:37,990
he restricted to inform you.

1274
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:39,871
then you should inform me afterwards?

1275
01:28:40,201 --> 01:28:42,623
or he has told don't
inform her after my death..

1276
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:46,235
Yes.. Sakshi..

1277
01:28:46,315 --> 01:28:48,026
Is the news about your father true?

1278
01:28:48,106 --> 01:28:49,147
Heart attack..

1279
01:28:49,317 --> 01:28:51,648
Was he very ill?

1280
01:28:51,738 --> 01:28:52,950
Sakshi should i call you later?

1281
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:55,241
I am not in a condition
to talk with anyone.

1282
01:28:59,243 --> 01:29:00,955
They don't have any work...

1283
01:29:01,705 --> 01:29:03,366
why are they calling me...

1284
01:29:03,616 --> 01:29:05,367
nobody has died in
their house before..

1285
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:12,041
when they question me

1286
01:29:12,251 --> 01:29:14,503
What do I tell people?

1287
01:29:15,543 --> 01:29:18,045
But I'm only unaware..

1288
01:29:22,668 --> 01:29:26,050
I didn't know you'll be so angry..

1289
01:29:28,552 --> 01:29:30,223
What did he say in the end?

1290
01:29:30,423 --> 01:29:35,726
When I m gone,
I don't know how she'll feel.

1291
01:29:36,387 --> 01:29:39,268
But when I'm gone she'll be hurt..

1292
01:29:47,773 --> 01:29:50,816
Till the end he
behaved badly with me..

1293
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:56,780
While going also he
proved himself correct..

1294
01:29:59,151 --> 01:30:01,613
I know emotionally we
did not have any relationship..

1295
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:04,244
But biologically he was my father..

1296
01:30:05,195 --> 01:30:06,695
Or that also he never accepted?

1297
01:30:19,453 --> 01:30:22,335
He gave me everything
that money could buy..

1298
01:30:25,297 --> 01:30:27,508
But he never gave
me love and his time..

1299
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:35,173
Sometimes I feel,
there was King Midas,

1300
01:30:37,215 --> 01:30:40,216
he had a blessing whatever
he touched turned gold..

1301
01:30:43,468 --> 01:30:45,520
Appa's fortune was also like that..

1302
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:50,603
That is why he never allowed
me to be close to him..

1303
01:30:53,935 --> 01:30:55,646
And he also never came close to me..

1304
01:31:10,405 --> 01:31:11,616
Savi..

1305
01:31:12,327 --> 01:31:15,908
Im not an emotional fool..
Im practical OK..

1306
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:19,291
Im very angry right now..

1307
01:31:20,702 --> 01:31:22,333
You sleep Inside..
We'll talk tommorrow..

1308
01:31:51,761 --> 01:31:54,143
Did you find the tea leaves
and the sugar in the kitchen?

1309
01:31:54,813 --> 01:31:58,015
I found it while searching
should i make coffee for you?

1310
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:00,066
No i will have later

1311
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,365
She is Ammi. my step mom

1312
01:32:15,576 --> 01:32:18,238
And he is ram.. My best friend.

1313
01:32:18,578 --> 01:32:20,580
in between he stays with me.

1314
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:22,330
Hello

1315
01:32:22,701 --> 01:32:23,911
will you have tea?

1316
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:26,243
why are you giving him so much
respect? He is not your son in law.

1317
01:32:26,743 --> 01:32:27,873
call him ram.

1318
01:32:28,745 --> 01:32:30,455
Tea.. no!

1319
01:32:31,706 --> 01:32:34,418
Savi told me about her father...

1320
01:32:35,588 --> 01:32:36,750
...its sad to hear

1321
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:41,633
why are you feelin sad?
its been 15 days he's no more

1322
01:32:45,885 --> 01:32:49,388
Savi i want to have a word with you

1323
01:32:49,638 --> 01:32:53,010
I will get ready for office

1324
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:55,181
You can talk in front of ram..

1325
01:32:57,763 --> 01:32:59,143
there is no problem in that

1326
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:10,811
what is this?

1327
01:33:13,022 --> 01:33:14,563
after the death of your father

1328
01:33:16,405 --> 01:33:18,946
Paanse read this.

1329
01:33:21,988 --> 01:33:24,370
you have the right
on every property now.

1330
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,531
There is only one condition.

1331
01:33:29,283 --> 01:33:34,575
As long as I am alive keep me at your
place like your own mother with love.

1332
01:33:36,707 --> 01:33:41,130
he has sold some shares and
had transferred money in my name.

1333
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:44,582
I will give it to you.

1334
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:46,923
what should I do with that?

1335
01:33:52,547 --> 01:33:54,468
means you are going
to stay with me here?

1336
01:33:56,009 --> 01:33:57,010
forever ?

1337
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:02,553
Yes..

1338
01:34:11,308 --> 01:34:14,310
I had only Appa in my life.

1339
01:34:16,772 --> 01:34:18,233
now he is also not there.

1340
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,565
where should I go?

1341
01:34:23,526 --> 01:34:25,908
I will not create any mess..

1342
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:31,611
I will look after your house.

1343
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,510
hello

1344
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,882
hello Savi Aman

1345
01:35:05,182 --> 01:35:06,053
yes Aman

1346
01:35:06,473 --> 01:35:07,433
how are you?

1347
01:35:08,265 --> 01:35:11,266
okay.. done with lab meeting?

1348
01:35:11,596 --> 01:35:12,977
yes. just now.

1349
01:35:14,558 --> 01:35:16,440
what have you decided to do?

1350
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:17,690
about what?

1351
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:20,942
means father's funeral prayer meet.

1352
01:35:21,022 --> 01:35:23,063
how are you going to do it?
where are you going to do it?

1353
01:35:23,233 --> 01:35:25,065
no we are not doing anything

1354
01:35:25,445 --> 01:35:26,195
ah!

1355
01:35:29,027 --> 01:35:33,780
means he had wished for that.
he was a progressive man.

1356
01:35:36,362 --> 01:35:39,743
okay.. nothing sir was
asking about meeting you.

1357
01:35:39,994 --> 01:35:41,745
I told him let her gather herself

1358
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:43,036
no formalities!

1359
01:35:43,116 --> 01:35:45,077
I am going to come as soon
as possible to the institute.

1360
01:35:45,157 --> 01:35:46,998
even we have to work
on the new module.

1361
01:35:47,078 --> 01:35:49,540
no.no.no..look..you
don't worry about it..

1362
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:51,581
we will come tomorrow and leave.

1363
01:35:51,661 --> 01:35:53,713
Aman, I will let
you know when to come,

1364
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:55,914
okay?

1365
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:58,165
I am a little busy...

1366
01:35:58,295 --> 01:35:58,966
Bye

1367
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:06,170
where should I leave you?

1368
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:09,553
leave anywhere?
or leave me on the road.

1369
01:36:11,593 --> 01:36:14,476
what happen to you? why are you angry?

1370
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:17,928
I am not able to face
my department people..

1371
01:36:18,848 --> 01:36:20,480
They are asking should
we come to meet you?

1372
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,681
Now they know about the
situation they will come Savi?

1373
01:36:24,852 --> 01:36:26,933
Ram please you don't start now..

1374
01:36:29,605 --> 01:36:31,436
I feel like running away

1375
01:36:34,398 --> 01:36:35,778
come to nagpur then?

1376
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:40,032
you will feel the change
and will meet my parents too

1377
01:36:41,443 --> 01:36:42,153
one second..

1378
01:36:43,573 --> 01:36:46,576
have you planned to
meet up with your parents?

1379
01:36:49,868 --> 01:36:51,158
I have told you that.. Ram..

1380
01:36:51,408 --> 01:36:53,120
but now things have changed Savi.

1381
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:56,122
we need to talk about this some day

1382
01:36:56,412 --> 01:36:57,042
about what

1383
01:36:58,083 --> 01:36:59,703
we love each other?

1384
01:37:00,205 --> 01:37:01,125
Yes

1385
01:37:01,755 --> 01:37:03,916
I don't feel we should get married

1386
01:37:05,508 --> 01:37:06,418
why?

1387
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:13,763
because love is a personal thing between
two people and marriage is a legal thing.

1388
01:37:14,553 --> 01:37:17,345
as per my opinion these two
are not related with each other.

1389
01:37:19,636 --> 01:37:22,518
So I am not going to
get married to show anyone.

1390
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:26,561
We had decided this Ram.

1391
01:37:28,892 --> 01:37:30,103
I love my privacy.

1392
01:37:32,565 --> 01:37:34,355
I feel suffocated in a crowd.

1393
01:37:38,278 --> 01:37:40,150
This is better.

1394
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:44,652
We should not expect
much from each other.

1395
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:58,491
Ram stop the car.

1396
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:12,130
Bye..
- Bye..

1397
01:39:14,288 --> 01:39:15,628
Why is this kept over here?

1398
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:19,591
You don't like it when someone
enters your room without permission.

1399
01:39:20,092 --> 01:39:21,593
So it's here..

1400
01:39:23,043 --> 01:39:24,135
what you want?

1401
01:39:25,595 --> 01:39:28,427
I don't like anyone who enters
my room without my permission.

1402
01:39:38,933 --> 01:39:46,938
"Different Parts are
different in our eyes."

1403
01:39:54,023 --> 01:40:01,568
"Different Parts are
different in our eyes."

1404
01:40:01,868 --> 01:40:08,782
"Why we do not have the
bond between you and me."

1405
01:40:09,493 --> 01:40:16,377
"Who is beyond this moment?"

1406
01:40:17,038 --> 01:40:22,921
"Who is beyond this moment?"
- And cigarette?

1407
01:40:23,001 --> 01:40:24,462
will start tomorrow

1408
01:40:28,465 --> 01:40:36,640
"By which relation
I am involved with you?"

1409
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:46,015
"By which relation
I am involved with you?"

1410
01:40:47,516 --> 01:40:54,150
"Who do I have to
follow along with you?"

1411
01:40:55,191 --> 01:41:01,445
"Who do I have to
follow along with you?"

1412
01:41:05,978 --> 01:41:07,940
Ammi my mom

1413
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:09,940
she looks your sister...

1414
01:41:10,311 --> 01:41:11,812
ya but she is my mom,

1415
01:41:11,902 --> 01:41:13,233
but stepmother

1416
01:41:15,364 --> 01:41:17,735
she takes my case a lot with me...

1417
01:41:18,526 --> 01:41:20,778
Lets take a photo... smile!

1418
01:41:21,568 --> 01:41:29,163
"Is this because of
your love or companionship."

1419
01:41:32,955 --> 01:41:39,419
"Is this because of
your love or companionship."

1420
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:47,294
"What should I name this feeling?"

1421
01:41:48,215 --> 01:41:55,429
"What should I name this feeling?"

1422
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:02,513
"The thought of this
thought lingers in my mind."

1423
01:42:03,434 --> 01:42:10,188
"The thought of this
thought lingers in my mind."

1424
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:21,065
"Avoid getting involved
in what to say."

1425
01:42:22,356 --> 01:42:29,280
"Who do I have to
follow along with you!"

1426
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:49,873
I can't decide instantly.
give me some time.

1427
01:42:50,503 --> 01:42:52,375
marriage is not a joke.

1428
01:42:55,466 --> 01:42:56,928
am I saying no?

1429
01:42:57,968 --> 01:43:01,050
I must have also decided
something about my life.

1430
01:43:02,261 --> 01:43:06,683
Don't blackmail me emotionally
giving reasons about your health

1431
01:43:07,685 --> 01:43:08,975
Please give me some time.

1432
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:12,387
How much I can't tell you.

1433
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:19,061
I will talk to you as I come there.

1434
01:43:19,812 --> 01:43:22,733
I am leaving for office now.
please keep the Phone..

1435
01:43:24,735 --> 01:43:25,445
Bye..

1436
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:36,282
Ammi.. my mother had called

1437
01:43:37,153 --> 01:43:37,993
I know.

1438
01:43:38,493 --> 01:43:41,785
we talk in this manner either
with our mother or wife.

1439
01:43:42,406 --> 01:43:46,288
you don't have a wife
means she was your mother.

1440
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:48,910
Where is savi?

1441
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,502
She is in the hall doing some work

1442
01:43:53,163 --> 01:43:55,294
You please don't misunderstand me.

1443
01:43:55,965 --> 01:44:00,508
My family is pressurizing
me for marriage so I got angry a bit.

1444
01:44:07,722 --> 01:44:09,763
Savi what is your plan for diwali?

1445
01:44:10,303 --> 01:44:13,015
we were planning to go
to lonavala to Geeta's bungalow.

1446
01:44:13,555 --> 01:44:15,767
if you have not fixed anything
then shall we go to Nagpur?

1447
01:44:16,307 --> 01:44:19,770
Why something special?
are you getting married?

1448
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:21,560
you say whatever comes to your mind?

1449
01:44:25,643 --> 01:44:27,234
If you want we will go to Tadoba.

1450
01:44:27,314 --> 01:44:28,685
should I ask Sandeep and Neha too?

1451
01:44:28,985 --> 01:44:31,026
Ram if it is so you go and come

1452
01:44:33,568 --> 01:44:37,530
but why are you not coming?

1453
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:38,821
No...

1454
01:44:39,902 --> 01:44:44,445
once I meet them they will start
expecting from me and i don't want that.

1455
01:44:44,655 --> 01:44:46,156
So please don't force me.

1456
01:44:47,196 --> 01:44:50,698
Your favorite person should always
be with you. is this feeling wrong?

1457
01:44:50,908 --> 01:44:51,950
not at all.

1458
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:55,832
but I think
its a mistake to bind in anyway.

1459
01:44:57,003 --> 01:44:58,873
You can't do this much for me ?

1460
01:44:59,204 --> 01:45:01,205
Look! it starts from here

1461
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:03,507
and then its an unending process.

1462
01:45:04,207 --> 01:45:05,708
Ram are we doing the deal?

1463
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:10,591
you do a bit I will do a bit..
then it will not work.

1464
01:45:12,382 --> 01:45:14,053
then what you want to prove?

1465
01:45:15,344 --> 01:45:17,926
Give freedon to person whom you love.

1466
01:45:19,717 --> 01:45:21,888
even if you are not loved back.

1467
01:45:28,973 --> 01:45:31,274
Ram I think you are
mentally disturbed. so you..

1468
01:45:31,354 --> 01:45:33,936
you don't start your
psychological analysis on me.

1469
01:45:35,477 --> 01:45:37,858
I don't understand
what to talk with you.

1470
01:45:40,230 --> 01:45:41,070
okay

1471
01:45:43,111 --> 01:45:46,533
besides, forcing me to come
to nagpur you can talk about anything.

1472
01:45:48,785 --> 01:45:50,286
then question does not arise.

1473
01:45:52,578 --> 01:45:55,239
but I need to go
for somedays to nagpur.

1474
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:00,082
our company has made
a huge setup over there.

1475
01:46:00,993 --> 01:46:03,835
and being project head
responsibility is on me.

1476
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:18,383
Savi the person whom
you love where he stays?

1477
01:46:18,713 --> 01:46:21,305
how his house is?
what about his parents?

1478
01:46:22,096 --> 01:46:24,928
you don't have any curiosity about it?

1479
01:46:46,481 --> 01:46:48,523
when are you leaving?

1480
01:46:50,113 --> 01:46:51,575
tomorrow by morning flight

1481
01:46:52,445 --> 01:46:53,575
Why in between

1482
01:46:54,526 --> 01:46:56,828
There is no difference
between both our bosses...

1483
01:46:57,448 --> 01:46:59,028
they don't ask...

1484
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:04,162
we take decision...
so do I have an option?

1485
01:47:08,495 --> 01:47:09,956
When your project will be done?

1486
01:47:12,087 --> 01:47:12,998
Don't know

1487
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:19,712
I will miss you

1488
01:47:27,347 --> 01:47:28,257
Take care

1489
01:47:29,628 --> 01:47:30,999
You came after so long

1490
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:31,840
Yes..

1491
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,300
How come?

1492
01:47:33,711 --> 01:47:35,462
just to meet you

1493
01:47:36,963 --> 01:47:39,004
what is this? I cant come?

1494
01:47:39,345 --> 01:47:40,465
No, not like that..

1495
01:47:41,305 --> 01:47:43,927
Savi is not here , that is why..

1496
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:45,808
What is this?

1497
01:47:46,508 --> 01:47:48,350
KADA..

1498
01:47:49,851 --> 01:47:51,472
When is Savi coming from Indore?

1499
01:47:52,012 --> 01:47:53,473
She'll come tonight..

1500
01:47:54,353 --> 01:47:55,855
Did she tell you anything else?

1501
01:47:56,315 --> 01:47:58,066
Yes, she told me...

1502
01:48:00,228 --> 01:48:00,858
What?

1503
01:48:01,068 --> 01:48:03,400
that tomorrow she is going somewhere..

1504
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:04,610
where?

1505
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:07,232
that she will tell
me once she is back today..

1506
01:48:08,403 --> 01:48:13,025
that is so much Savi..

1507
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:16,528
Means what? Nothing

1508
01:48:16,988 --> 01:48:19,660
I'll call her,
we have not spoken since long..

1509
01:48:21,741 --> 01:48:22,371
Hello

1510
01:48:22,451 --> 01:48:23,662
Where are you?

1511
01:48:23,832 --> 01:48:25,953
I am here only...tell me what happen?

1512
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:26,583
What happen?

1513
01:48:26,663 --> 01:48:28,995
I am trying to call
you from four days.

1514
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:30,376
Neha visited your house

1515
01:48:30,416 --> 01:48:33,378
I was attending Aman's
wedding in Indore

1516
01:48:33,538 --> 01:48:34,378
Yes..yes

1517
01:48:34,418 --> 01:48:35,630
Wedding was at outskirts

1518
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:37,210
so there was network issue..

1519
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:38,341
what happen!

1520
01:48:39,092 --> 01:48:41,963
nothing special we
have not met since a month

1521
01:48:42,503 --> 01:48:43,885
when we will meet..

1522
01:48:44,295 --> 01:48:45,926
do you have any plans on friday?

1523
01:48:46,346 --> 01:48:47,257
Nothing as of now..

1524
01:48:47,347 --> 01:48:50,178
Okay! Then I and Neha will
come for dinner at your place

1525
01:48:50,508 --> 01:48:51,760
at 8 pm done

1526
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:52,970
okay we will meet bye

1527
01:49:02,816 --> 01:49:04,028
Thank you for calling.

1528
01:49:05,528 --> 01:49:08,240
Its been a long time
we had a talk with each other.

1529
01:49:13,203 --> 01:49:15,995
Actually Savi dinner
was just an excuse to come here.

1530
01:49:17,576 --> 01:49:19,537
we both wanted to talk to you

1531
01:49:20,078 --> 01:49:22,829
Then why do you need any
occasion to talk? You say

1532
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:27,122
Have you spoken with Ram in this week?

1533
01:49:28,043 --> 01:49:28,623
No..

1534
01:49:28,963 --> 01:49:33,296
but few days before he told me
that he will be in Mumbai this weekend

1535
01:49:34,796 --> 01:49:36,878
Savi I don't think he
will come back to Mumbai

1536
01:49:38,088 --> 01:49:39,050
Means?

1537
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:43,802
I told you Savi must
not be knowing anything.

1538
01:49:43,882 --> 01:49:46,053
Finally I need to tell her everything.
- Sandeep please don't

1539
01:49:46,133 --> 01:49:47,475
No. she must know...Neha.

1540
01:49:47,555 --> 01:49:49,185
then she will take her own decision.

1541
01:49:49,846 --> 01:49:52,228
it is better if we will inform her.

1542
01:49:54,228 --> 01:49:55,890
What should I know?

1543
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,981
How can Ram do that?

1544
01:49:59,442 --> 01:50:01,023
Has he behaved
Aggressively with anyone?

1545
01:50:01,523 --> 01:50:04,695
stupid girl... no one else but you.

1546
01:50:05,145 --> 01:50:07,107
only this much

1547
01:50:08,698 --> 01:50:10,448
You take everything lightly?

1548
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:14,531
why he should behave
with you in this manner?

1549
01:50:14,901 --> 01:50:17,203
He's my friend doesn't
mean I will take this shit?

1550
01:50:17,703 --> 01:50:19,865
How can he hurt you?

1551
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:25,078
You don't laugh...
are you mad or are you blind?

1552
01:50:25,158 --> 01:50:28,160
Sandeep stop shouting...

1553
01:50:30,501 --> 01:50:31,582
Savi.

1554
01:50:33,083 --> 01:50:36,165
Savi few days before
Ram got married in Nagpur

1555
01:50:40,338 --> 01:50:41,298
With whom?

1556
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:50,724
Savi what is the situation
and what question are you asking?

1557
01:50:52,385 --> 01:50:54,766
do you understand the seriousness
about this situation?

1558
01:50:55,137 --> 01:50:58,679
He got married to Ashwini Deshpande.

1559
01:50:58,769 --> 01:51:01,641
What you are talking
Neha? And what you are talking?

1560
01:51:02,021 --> 01:51:04,273
if you will keep shouting
like this truth is not going to hide

1561
01:51:04,353 --> 01:51:04,983
so that's why I...

1562
01:51:05,063 --> 01:51:06,774
Please be quiet..Please

1563
01:51:12,398 --> 01:51:13,648
Ashwini?

1564
01:51:15,690 --> 01:51:17,901
the one who we met in the mall?

1565
01:51:17,991 --> 01:51:19,152
Hmm...

1566
01:51:21,863 --> 01:51:23,825
She is a very ordinary girl..

1567
01:51:27,867 --> 01:51:32,660
Neha Ram must be feeling
inferior with me?

1568
01:51:35,452 --> 01:51:37,953
did you feel something
by his behavior?

1569
01:51:39,665 --> 01:51:40,955
actually No...But

1570
01:51:41,045 --> 01:51:45,208
Stupid ladies why are you'll
doing psychological analysis on Ram?

1571
01:51:45,878 --> 01:51:47,840
you tell me what
you are going to do now.

1572
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:50,301
How can she say it quickly

1573
01:51:50,381 --> 01:51:51,712
then what should we do?

1574
01:51:51,923 --> 01:51:53,213
Give her some time

1575
01:51:54,513 --> 01:51:56,305
but we are her friends only na?

1576
01:51:57,175 --> 01:52:00,558
Yes Sandeep... I can
understand your concern... but

1577
01:52:01,218 --> 01:52:03,520
What's the use of rushing.

1578
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,431
We should give her some space

1579
01:52:08,973 --> 01:52:11,275
and she will not say anything now.

1580
01:52:12,145 --> 01:52:13,356
I know her.

1581
01:52:16,728 --> 01:52:17,568
Let's go

1582
01:52:28,535 --> 01:52:29,946
Savi we are leaving.

1583
01:52:32,118 --> 01:52:33,618
We will talk later.

1584
01:52:38,621 --> 01:52:40,913
Please take care of her.

1585
01:53:03,467 --> 01:53:04,508

1586
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:08,310

1619
01:54:39,487 --> 01:54:40,158

Bye

1623
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:44,700
Bye

1624
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:45,821
what is this?

1625
01:54:46,701 --> 01:54:47,572
take

1626
01:54:47,662 --> 01:54:49,453
Means what? Do we have tickets?

1627
01:54:49,533 --> 01:54:51,035
No means... that also I have to do

1628
01:54:54,076 --> 01:54:59,710
Savi, Savi means Ram was
searching Apparel shops for her.

1629
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:00,380
Who?

1630
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:01,671
Ram

1631
01:55:07,795 --> 01:55:09,386
chitralekha...

1632
01:55:10,887 --> 01:55:12,548
How is your Ashwini?

1633
01:55:12,758 --> 01:55:13,508
Mine?

1634
01:55:14,088 --> 01:55:14,639
Yes

1635
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:16,430
then...Means how is she?

1636
01:55:17,431 --> 01:55:18,341
she is simple

1637
01:55:18,591 --> 01:55:19,973
simple is good.

1638
01:55:20,473 --> 01:55:24,895
but she has not uttered any intelligent
sentence since half an hour

1639
01:55:25,646 --> 01:55:27,267
there is no spark in her.

1640
01:55:27,687 --> 01:55:30,599
after talking two lines with her I was
thinking what should I talk with her?

1641
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:33,231
Aman was laughing so much..

1642
01:55:34,061 --> 01:55:35,602
how is she a friend of Ram?

1643
01:55:35,693 --> 01:55:38,484
every girl is not smart
and genius like you

1644
01:55:38,905 --> 01:55:41,816
and everyone does not have
intellectual friends like you.

1645
01:55:42,987 --> 01:55:44,068
there are some simple people.

1646
01:55:44,778 --> 01:55:46,950
then we should not be
friends with simple people.

1647
01:56:58,324 --> 01:56:59,535
where should I keep this?

1648
01:57:03,457 --> 01:57:05,328
I don't have place in cupboard

1649
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:09,831
...please keep these clothes in
your room. Will see later what to do.

1650
01:57:12,213 --> 01:57:16,295
Ammi I am not there for lunch.
Don't wait for me

1651
01:57:58,401 --> 01:57:59,492
Yes... Hello

1652
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:03,575
Hello Ammi... I am Ram speaking...

1653
01:58:06,496 --> 01:58:07,407
Hello

1654
01:58:08,498 --> 01:58:11,290
Ammi.. Savi is there?

1655
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:14,872
No. She has gone outside

1656
01:58:16,503 --> 01:58:19,295
Yes I am calling her but
she is not answering my call.

1657
01:58:20,875 --> 01:58:22,757
she knows you got married

1658
01:58:30,922 --> 01:58:33,303
I want to talk with her

1659
01:58:35,215 --> 01:58:35,715
what?

1660
01:58:39,558 --> 01:58:40,678
Should I keep the call?

1661
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:33,751
Aman's mom and dad left?

1662
01:59:34,251 --> 01:59:35,553
No. They will go tomorrow

1663
01:59:37,713 --> 01:59:42,506
Ram had called...He wants to talk to you

1664
01:59:43,598 --> 01:59:44,428
about what?

1665
01:59:45,008 --> 01:59:46,560
About his marriage

1666
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:48,510
What's the use now?

1667
01:59:49,601 --> 01:59:51,312
Your angry because he got married

1668
01:59:52,063 --> 01:59:54,765
nah! It's his choice....

1669
01:59:55,975 --> 01:59:59,608
but why a girl like Ashwini.

1670
02:00:00,228 --> 02:00:02,519
Were you going to
get married with him?

1671
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:06,111
you know what I think of marriage.

1672
02:00:07,402 --> 02:00:08,363
We both are mature.

1673
02:00:09,023 --> 02:00:10,113
We had decided

1674
02:00:10,444 --> 02:00:14,116
We will stay together till we love
each other or else we will get separated.

1675
02:00:15,237 --> 02:00:17,028
then why are you hurt so much?

1676
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:23,372
for simple things we used
to take advice from each other..

1677
02:00:24,453 --> 02:00:26,164
share all small things..

1678
02:00:29,536 --> 02:00:32,628
then how he took a big
decision without asking or telling me.

1679
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:37,961
Is that the amount of trust he had on me.

1680
02:00:40,673 --> 02:00:41,593
look Savi..

1681
02:00:43,215 --> 02:00:47,177
you both decided to stay
together without expecting anything.

1682
02:00:47,968 --> 02:00:49,348
you both loved each other a lot.

1683
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:52,350
but Ram had not stopped there.

1684
02:00:53,351 --> 02:00:55,643
he reached till marriage in his mind.

1685
02:00:56,643 --> 02:00:59,145
You stayed on your decision..

1686
02:00:59,515 --> 02:01:02,607
but where's the mistake.
we had decided everything

1687
02:01:02,767 --> 02:01:04,728
it is not the question
of right or wrong...

1688
02:01:06,229 --> 02:01:10,982
our soul starts expecting
anything, anytime

1689
02:01:14,444 --> 02:01:16,906
if he had told me once.
I would have not stopped him.

1690
02:01:19,948 --> 02:01:21,488
In fact I would have
attended his wedding.

1691
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:26,492
I would have loved
to see him as a groom.

1692
02:01:29,453 --> 02:01:30,665
that would hurt me

1693
02:01:32,745 --> 02:01:35,207
but I would have loved
him seeing like that.

1694
02:01:37,668 --> 02:01:40,000
ya he made a mistake.

1695
02:01:41,001 --> 02:01:41,831
leave it now.

1696
02:01:43,212 --> 02:01:45,833
he must not be strong like you..

1697
02:01:46,715 --> 02:01:49,006
he wont be so strong emotionally..

1698
02:01:50,386 --> 02:01:57,591
Savi, you only say that marriage
and love are two different things.

1699
02:01:58,762 --> 02:02:02,013
love vanishes when you get married.
then its just a compromise.

1700
02:02:03,475 --> 02:02:06,517
then its good for you!

1701
02:02:07,478 --> 02:02:09,688
dealing things have not
arrived in your relation.

1702
02:02:10,309 --> 02:02:12,690
only love was there

1703
02:02:14,772 --> 02:02:17,233
which is always with you.

1704
02:02:49,293 --> 02:02:50,505
where is Ammi? Ammi

1705
02:03:02,882 --> 02:03:03,883
Ammi

1706
02:03:06,635 --> 02:03:07,345
Ammi

1707
02:03:10,687 --> 02:03:11,768
what happen?

1708
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:16,140
what happen? you are not feeling well?

1709
02:03:19,022 --> 02:03:20,063
what happen?

1710
02:03:20,943 --> 02:03:22,645
you have fever..Ammi

1711
02:03:23,145 --> 02:03:25,696
Ammi.Ammi

1712
02:03:26,697 --> 02:03:28,988
Ammi what happen?

1713
02:03:33,701 --> 02:03:35,152
miss Savitri sardesai

1714
02:03:35,242 --> 02:03:35,743
me

1715
02:03:35,823 --> 02:03:37,533
Doctor has called you
- yes

1716
02:03:45,408 --> 02:03:46,079
yes

1717
02:03:55,375 --> 02:03:56,045
Sit

1718
02:03:57,716 --> 02:03:58,627
Thank you..

1719
02:04:00,008 --> 02:04:03,590
Miss Sardesai Mrs Amala
- My mother

1720
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,511
Mother Okay

1721
02:04:05,591 --> 02:04:06,301
How is she?

1722
02:04:06,922 --> 02:04:08,723
She is under observation..

1723
02:04:10,054 --> 02:04:11,725
she is affected with Leukemia

1724
02:04:14,136 --> 02:04:14,977
who Ammi?

1725
02:04:15,057 --> 02:04:17,138
Yes last stage.

1726
02:04:18,179 --> 02:04:19,730
She doesn't have much time left

1727
02:04:22,181 --> 02:04:23,393
direct last stage?

1728
02:04:23,813 --> 02:04:24,773
Yes!

1729
02:04:26,274 --> 02:04:28,065
but I dint see any symptoms

1730
02:04:29,436 --> 02:04:32,568
Patient's immunity slowly comes down.

1731
02:04:33,738 --> 02:04:35,860
Even fever or cold
can create problems...

1732
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:37,321
suddenly infections are created...

1733
02:04:37,401 --> 02:04:40,903
but we feel it to be regular so we don't
understand the seriousness of it.

1734
02:04:43,745 --> 02:04:45,576
Yes. This every time happens to Ammi.

1735
02:04:48,908 --> 02:04:50,079
but how should I convey this to her.

1736
02:04:51,950 --> 02:04:53,081
She knows...Nurse

1737
02:05:04,298 --> 02:05:04,958
Yes sir!

1738
02:05:05,708 --> 02:05:08,340
take her to Mrs Amala

1739
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:09,011
Okay Sir!

1740
02:05:09,171 --> 02:05:09,761
Madam

1741
02:05:11,803 --> 02:05:12,713
Please

1742
02:05:37,818 --> 02:05:39,030
So you knew this?

1743
02:05:41,361 --> 02:05:42,231
and Appa also?

1744
02:05:43,152 --> 02:05:44,033
Yes

1745
02:05:45,573 --> 02:05:47,115
Then why was this hidden from me.

1746
02:05:48,535 --> 02:05:52,578
this was not hidden...you never asked

1747
02:05:54,950 --> 02:05:56,450
from when is this going on?

1748
02:05:57,451 --> 02:05:58,041
What?

1749
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:00,123
Your illness...

1750
02:06:01,793 --> 02:06:04,335
from the time I was 20 -21 year old.

1751
02:06:05,996 --> 02:06:07,878
Doctor had said then

1752
02:06:08,748 --> 02:06:10,920
I would have 7-8 years in my hand

1753
02:06:12,671 --> 02:06:14,592
I feel now the moment has arrived!

1754
02:06:14,802 --> 02:06:16,503
Speaking like this
you feel it sounds funny?

1755
02:06:15,993 --> 02:06:17,865
How would anyone know..

1756
02:06:27,910 --> 02:06:29,581
why you have not told me?

1757
02:06:31,163 --> 02:06:33,213
what would have changed?

1758
02:06:34,375 --> 02:06:35,875
I will die any moment.

1759
02:06:36,586 --> 02:06:38,878
What could you have
done to change this.

1760
02:06:46,012 --> 02:06:48,173
Appa knew this before
you got married to him?

1761
02:06:48,383 --> 02:06:49,013
Yes

1762
02:06:51,515 --> 02:06:52,806
then too he got married to you?

1763
02:06:55,018 --> 02:06:58,600
Your Appa had came to
belgaum for case purpose.

1764
02:07:00,311 --> 02:07:02,813
there he met my father.

1765
02:07:04,773 --> 02:07:06,685
both knew each other from school days.

1766
02:07:07,775 --> 02:07:09,646
they met after a long time.

1767
02:07:12,108 --> 02:07:18,823
That time my relative
took away our property..

1768
02:07:20,943 --> 02:07:22,745
We had bad days..

1769
02:07:23,996 --> 02:07:26,287
Court sessions to look..

1770
02:07:27,248 --> 02:07:31,250
your father introduced
a lawyer to my father.

1771
02:07:32,451 --> 02:07:34,162
he also gave money to fight the case

1772
02:07:35,583 --> 02:07:38,045
and during that period
he came to our house.

1773
02:07:41,456 --> 02:07:46,670
When he arrived the second time,
my dad died of thypoid.

1774
02:07:51,173 --> 02:07:52,803
I didn't have anything else..

1775
02:07:54,305 --> 02:07:56,266
My mother left when I was young..

1776
02:07:57,847 --> 02:08:02,850
We got married so you and me
could be friends, stay together..

1777
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:05,271
then he should have brought
a friend for his daughter..

1778
02:08:06,352 --> 02:08:07,853
why he brought a mother?

1779
02:08:12,026 --> 02:08:14,397
If I would have come
like a friend at our home

1780
02:08:14,898 --> 02:08:17,319
everyone would have taken
some different meaning,

1781
02:08:18,530 --> 02:08:19,610
and tell me ....

1782
02:08:20,481 --> 02:08:23,653
you would have allowed me
to stay with you as your friend?

1783
02:08:27,155 --> 02:08:31,988
I came as your mother
so you accepted me.

1784
02:08:39,203 --> 02:08:41,795
Your Appa did not get a step mom

1785
02:08:43,495 --> 02:08:45,627
but he supported an ill girl.

1786
02:08:47,498 --> 02:08:49,128
he cared for me a lot.

1787
02:09:01,256 --> 02:09:06,350
one day you came to show your trophy,
he opened the door...

1788
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,351
shivering

1789
02:09:12,063 --> 02:09:14,515
Amala what happened to you?

1790
02:09:18,938 --> 02:09:20,068
feeling cold.

1791
02:09:20,358 --> 02:09:25,191
Ammi, you sleeping?

1792
02:09:26,613 --> 02:09:28,443
I want to give you a surprise..

1793
02:09:30,445 --> 02:09:34,828
I got best student trophy

1794
02:09:34,908 --> 02:09:37,199
what is it haan

1795
02:09:53,790 --> 02:09:57,251
When the door was opened I understood
what question you had in your mind,

1796
02:09:58,463 --> 02:10:00,633
I chose to not acknowledge it.

1797
02:10:07,258 --> 02:10:11,260
Ammi..ammi ..ammi

1798
02:10:12,261 --> 02:10:18,435
Savi..sometimes we judge
a person in a wrong manner.

1799
02:10:32,653 --> 02:10:34,865
set yourself free..

1800
02:10:36,696 --> 02:10:38,528
don't stop yourself..

1801
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:44,661
that will not make you weak.

1802
02:10:46,202 --> 02:10:50,165
If you like freedom, then
why do you cage your feelings?

1803
02:10:50,995 --> 02:10:51,665
Ah?

1804
02:10:53,747 --> 02:10:57,169
I can stay without mother!
I can earn without father!

1805
02:10:57,249 --> 02:11:00,171
can stay alive without Ram!
what will you prove from this?

1806
02:11:01,331 --> 02:11:03,213
who is going to pat your back?

1807
02:11:04,083 --> 02:11:04,963
HA?

1808
02:11:07,926 --> 02:11:10,888
you have much more to live for...

1809
02:11:11,428 --> 02:11:12,508
And

1810
02:11:15,430 --> 02:11:16,431
Ammi...

1811
02:11:17,181 --> 02:11:18,012
Ammi...

1812
02:11:18,643 --> 02:11:19,433
Sister...

1813
02:11:19,803 --> 02:11:20,973
Sister...

1814
02:11:22,345 --> 02:11:24,436
Ammi...Ammi

1815
02:11:24,556 --> 02:11:25,767
please you sit outside.

1816
02:11:25,977 --> 02:11:27,938
Patient is suffering, please

1817
02:12:06,423 --> 02:12:09,254
I am not an emotional
fool... I am practical OK !

1818
02:12:12,216 --> 02:12:15,298
I have grown up by myself.. you were
not present in my growing up years.

1819
02:12:15,378 --> 02:12:16,928
Means you will not come back

1820
02:12:17,008 --> 02:12:18,840
You felt that I will come back?

1821
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:22,433
to become a lawyer and earn money
on others problem is not my interest.

1822
02:12:23,053 --> 02:12:26,635
By forcing like this you
cant prove your point Appa.

1823
02:12:26,765 --> 02:12:30,388
If you think I will behave in the way
you want me to then you are mistaken.

1824
02:12:30,478 --> 02:12:33,229
You will do whatever you feel like

1825
02:12:33,309 --> 02:12:34,850
Ram should we make a deal?

1826
02:12:35,020 --> 02:12:36,771
you do a bit and I will do a bit.

1827
02:12:37,602 --> 02:12:38,983
Or else it will not work

1828
02:12:40,733 --> 02:12:42,735
Savi you don't feel anything?

1829
02:12:42,815 --> 02:12:44,316
what should I call her?

1830
02:12:44,486 --> 02:12:45,146
who?

1831
02:12:45,236 --> 02:12:46,197
Your wife

1832
02:12:46,277 --> 02:12:48,738
She is Ammi... my step mom

1833
02:12:49,029 --> 02:12:51,901
Its just a fever she
will not die immediately

1834
02:12:52,651 --> 02:12:55,653
You also have no right
to interfere in my life.

1835
02:12:55,993 --> 02:12:59,495
right..its my mistake.

1836
02:13:36,979 --> 02:13:40,311
Miss Savitari, your mom is no more

1837
02:14:54,898 --> 02:14:57,570
I cried a lot on that day.

1838
02:14:59,110 --> 02:15:00,981
It was not only crying.

1839
02:15:01,982 --> 02:15:03,363
That moment I realized

1840
02:15:05,364 --> 02:15:08,576
I lived my life in my own way.

1841
02:15:09,987 --> 02:15:12,448
I was never close
to anyone and by the time

1842
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:15,991
I learnt my lessons...

1843
02:15:17,121 --> 02:15:19,083
Ammi was gone..

1844
02:15:20,833 --> 02:15:24,546
but while going she showed
me the way towards my life.

1845
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:35,963
So this is the story of me and Ammi..

1846
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:47,000
In this I am stubborn at Foreground and she is silent at background.
