2
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,083
This is the final word
in the world of dance

3
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,667
The Videocon.

4
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:07,250
WORLD DANCE CHAMPIONSHIP!

5
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,750
Team India?

6
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,375
Has anyone seen Team India?

7
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,625
Now with 1 act to go!

8
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,542
The last act by a team that...

9
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,917
...came here with Zero expectations.

10
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,958
Although this team has now...

11
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,417
...won a billion hearts,
the world over!

12
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:27,667
Astounding everyone by
reaching the Finals of WDC...

13
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,083
...this team is..

14
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,417
Team Indiaaaa!

15
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,750
Guys!

16
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,167
Team India is missing!

17
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:41,958
Black-White,

18
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,500
Rich-Poor,

19
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,042
Friends-Strangers..

20
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,042
It's all irrelevant.

21
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,167
Actually, there are just
Two kinds of people in the World

22
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,208
Winners...

23
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,375
...and Losers!

24
00:03:55,042 --> 00:04:00,250
And today 6 losers are awaited
on the biggest stage...

25
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:06,333
...6 losers who didn't come here
for this applause in the first place.

26
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:10,833
It was I who got them here
from the hazy streets of anonymity.

27
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:17,750
little knowing what
fate had in store for us.

28
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:19,792
Fate!

29
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,792
Fate is a bloody fickle thing -

30
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,958
changes sides anytime!

31
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,208
C'mon!

32
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,208
C'mon!

33
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,750
C'mon!

34
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,125
Come on, Charlie!

35
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,917
Come on.

36
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,542
Come on.

37
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,458
Come on.

38
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,375
1...

39
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,750
Get up Charlie!

40
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:08,958
2...

41
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:19,958
Yeahhh!

42
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,125
Hit! Hit!

43
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,708
Hit the gong!

44
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,792
Yeah..

45
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,125
Huh!

46
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,542
Charlie this Bald Bob...

47
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,167
...is beating the hell out of you!

48
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,333
Ah what can I say?
It's an occupational Hazard.

49
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,708
But that tree trunk
is thrashing you mercilessly!

50
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,417
How on earth are
you enduring such pain?

51
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,708
Who's getting thrashed to endure?

52
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,542
I get thrashed...

53
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,542
...so that I can come here everyday...

54
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,042
...get beaten up everyday...

55
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,042
...manipulate the odds everyday.

56
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:47,708
Charlie...

57
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,208
You have fixed this fight?

58
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,042
You have taken money to lose?

59
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,042
From Whom?

60
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,208
Charlie!

61
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:55,042
Charlie!

62
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:55,792
Charlie!

63
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,542
Charlie!

64
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,167
From Mr. Motwani?

65
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,250
He is a really dangerous guy!

66
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,167
Hurry up and go Charlie..
And Fall quickly!

67
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,375
Be careful Charlie.

68
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,792
Lose and come Tiger!

69
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,208
Don't worry...

70
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,042
Charlie.

71
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,167
I'll handle it.

72
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,375
Hey..

73
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,250
Fall Dammit!

74
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,458
Everyone's watching..

75
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,167
Try harder, like you mean it.

76
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,458
You want to get thrashed...

77
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,292
...for all your money's worth eh?

78
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,583
A thief's son...

79
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,292
Come on, Charlie.

80
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,500
...and such honesty?

81
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:06,292
You do know that
everyone here knows...

82
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,083
...that your father was a thief.

83
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,542
A thief's son!

84
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,958
Thief!

85
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,958
Thief!

86
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,292
Thief!

87
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,958
Thief!

88
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,833
Thief!

89
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,375
What the hell have you done, Charlie?

90
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,208
If Bob doesn't get up...

91
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:32,750
...you will never be able to
fight here again. You know that right?

92
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,417
Bob get up...

93
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:35,500
He won't get up.

94
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,417
Won't get up?

95
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,542
Which means you..

96
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,708
Ehhh...

97
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,750
Charlie!

98
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm Charlie

99
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,792
Real name: Chandramohan
Manohar Sharma.

100
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,667
A topper from Boston University..

101
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:53,417
But a loser by Fate.

102
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,917
To earn an honest buck
in this city for me had...

103
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:02,042
...not only become difficult,
it had become impossible.

104
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,875
Why?

105
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,042
That's a long Story!

106
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,125
The Pretigious Diamond Company,
'Shimmer Diamonds'...

107
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,708
...is shifting an extremely rare
collection of diamonds for an exhibition...

108
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,667
...from Pretoria to Antwerp.

109
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,125
The security of these priceless
diamonds has been given...

110
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,958
...to the world-renowned
security firm...

111
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,667
...Shalimar International!

112
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,875
So now the custodian of these diamonds,
is the Owner of Shalimar International...

113
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,333
...Mr. Charan Grover.

114
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:40,583
Lets take a quick look at
the ongoing live press conference.

115
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,833
Thank you... Thank you everybody!

116
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,542
Is it true that these diamonds...

117
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,042
...are coming to Dubai for a night?

118
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,250
Before they reach Antwerp,
on Christmas Eve,

119
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,042
just for one night...

120
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,458
... these diamonds will
be kept here at the Atlantis,

121
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,208
in the Shalimar.

122
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,917
Private Collectors
in the Grey Market...

123
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,833
... have estimated these Diamonds
to be worth about 50 million dollars.

124
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,375
Its too less...

125
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,042
...how can one put a value...

126
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,458
...on 9 priceless diamonds
of the Mughal Dynasty?

127
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,125
And the same night,
the opening ceremony of the..

128
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,042
..World Dance Championship
is also being held here right?

129
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,625
Absolutely, Shimmer Diamonds has...

130
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,000
...graciously sponsored the World
Dance Championship Trophy this year.

131
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,500
This time around, the trophy
has been made in solid Gold.

132
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:27,458
In fact, the copies of these
very diamonds have been set in it.

133
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:31,458
The trophy itself is worth
over a quarter of a million dollars.

134
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,917
So you see,
it's a win-win situation for all.

135
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,583
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

136
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,333
It's now Time to go get Jag.

137
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,375
Roll sound.

138
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,208
Ha Ha Hee Hee, shot 1, take 1.

139
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,708
Action!

140
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,167
Cut.. cut.. cut.. cut!

141
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,583
Who is the stupid bomb guy?

142
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,625
He's bursting the wrong bomb
at the wrong time at the wrong place...

143
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,708
You go call him.

144
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,000
You go call him & get him here!

145
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,750
Aye Jag!

146
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:36,750
Aye Jag!

147
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,458
Jag! Captain Jagmohan Prakash.

148
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,750
Ex Bomb squad.

149
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,042
You Deaf Mule!

150
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,458
A soldier gives his
years to his country,

151
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,208
Jag gave his ear.

152
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,375
The director is calling!

153
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,500
What's written in this?
What's written in this?

154
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,625
Its written that when
the lady gyrates her hips,

155
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,083
then the blast should happen...

156
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,500
The hips gyrated,
but the colorful blasts were wrong!

157
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,167
What's the matter Mr. Director?

158
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,667
What's the matter Mr. Director?

159
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,000
I've been telling you since morning..

160
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,417
Oh, oh, open shirt,

161
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,958
6 pack abs, dard-e-disco look?

162
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,958
On my set?

163
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:17,667
This is unacceptable.
I've been teaching you since morning,

164
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,375
Bomb 2-3-4, Bomb 2-3-4...

165
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,917
...Bomb 2-3-4.

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,417
That's what I did
Bomb 2-3, Bomb 2-3

167
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,875
Where the hell did 4 go?
On a holiday?

168
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,292
What sir?
- What sir?

169
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,333
Are you freaking mad?

170
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,208
Huh?

171
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:34,458
Did your mother drop you
on you head when you were a kid,

172
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:35,917
that you don't understand anything?

173
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,083
Lunatic Son,

174
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,417
Lunatic Mother!

175
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,042
Its essential that
you know 2 things about

176
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,458
One: Jag Worships his mother.

177
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,625
Two: Jag gets really pissed off ...

178
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,792
...when someone insults his mother.

179
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,042
Lunatic mother!

180
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,667
Director Sir!

181
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,292
Don't say anything about my mother!

182
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,125
Why? Is your mom
the great Mother India?

183
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,583
I'm warning you I may hit you.

184
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,583
You can hit me.

185
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,458
But not on a girl...

186
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,333
Save me.

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,500
I just want to say one thing to you..

188
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,625
Your mother is a lunatic!

189
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,500
DIRECTOR Sirrr!

190
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,667
Hey..

191
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,417
We are going to kill Grover, right?

192
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,583
No..

193
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,042
No, jag.

194
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,667
What?

195
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,250
Charlie you don't want to kill
that one Man who ruined all our lives?

196
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,667
Manohar uncle was your dad,
but he was no less of a father to me..

197
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,750
Coz of this scumbag
he is in jail till today.

198
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,042
8 years, since 8 years
I've been waiting for this.

199
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,167
Even I have been waiting since 8 years

200
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,292
Jag but Timing, timing is everything.

201
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,708
Charlie! Just tell me once
where can we find this Grover!

202
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,500
If I wanted to kill him,
I would have killed him by Now.

203
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,042
Since 8 years I've been following
him everywhere like a shadow!

204
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,333
London, Berlin,

205
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,458
Vienna, Paris, New York, everywhere.

206
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,500
Charan Grover would have
been dead 7 times by now...

207
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,292
...but you know what jag?

208
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,792
Death is a trivial punishment for him.

209
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,417
Justice will be...

210
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,625
...when he craves for
death and doesn't get it.

211
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,458
I want to destroy him..

212
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,625
...as much as he destroyed us.

213
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,458
So then what are
we waiting for Charlie?

214
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,833
I'm here, you're here.

215
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,292
What else do we need?
- No.

216
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,375
We are not the only
ones who want revenge Jag.

217
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,792
This vengeance is for all three of us.

218
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,208
Your going to take
that fat lump along?

219
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,208
Yes Jag!

220
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,625
This vengeance is
incomplete without him!

221
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,042
But Charlie?
- Jag...

222
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,750
...we have to get Tammy...

223
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,333
Our Fat Lump!

224
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,833
Temhton Irani...

225
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,458
...the 50 year old chick
magnet of Parsi Colony...

226
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,542
...& the world's best safe cracker.

227
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,042
But Tammy was no Thief.

228
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,000
He used to test the
safes in my dad's factory.

229
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,625
Its essential that you
know 2 things about Tammy.

230
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,583
One; Tammy carries an entire
supermarket in his satchel..

231
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,667
..and two, there is everything
in this satchel, except money.

232
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,000
Tammy..

233
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,875
Tammy Iraniiiii..!

234
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:07,583
Scoundrel's wearing loose, baggy shorts
& jogging, hitting on these girls!

235
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:11,167
Come here, Come here and stand.
Here take this money..

236
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,667
Hurry up & get me my eggs & bread..

237
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,042
Always cribbing!

238
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,208
Yes mama!

239
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,500
Hurry up & take it!

240
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,667
Coming Mamma.

241
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,417
Oye my money is in
it be careful with it!

242
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,292
Yes mama...

243
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,583
Last time a quarter
was unaccounted for,

244
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,458
now hurry up and take it rogue!

245
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,958
I understand...

246
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ok!

247
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,000
We have to break into
the Shalimar security systems...

248
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,167
...which is the most
advanced in the world...

249
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,958
Then we have to crack
the safe within &...

250
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,500
...then steal the 9 priceless diamonds
from there. Right?

251
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,583
Right.

252
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,417
Correct?

253
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Exactly Tammy..
- What utter nonsense..

254
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,333
Where are you going?

255
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,250
I am going home & the two
of you go to the mental hospital.

256
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,625
I told you this fatso
is good for nothing!

257
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,875
Who you calling a fatso huh?

258
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,000
Who you calling a fatso?

259
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:09,875
You who else!

260
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,000
Ai you deaf Bull!

261
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,500
One clip I'll give
you under your ear nah.

262
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,125
Your sound system will
go from Mono to mute.

263
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,167
Hey Ronnie!

264
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,833
Hey Ronnie did my boy come here?

265
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,042
Did you see that Idiot?
- Hide me Charlie. Hide me!

266
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,875
Where the hell is he?

267
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,833
You know that rogue has
absconded with 22 rupees of mine!

268
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,000
O shit!

269
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,292
This lump still gets these fits!

270
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,000
Aye fatso!

271
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,500
He's not got himself treated yet.

272
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,958
Don't worry, he gets these
fits whenever he's stressed,

273
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,125
but just for 30 seconds.

274
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,667
If he comes you tell him,
his mother was remembering him.

275
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,833
I'm going to smack him!

276
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,667
27.28.29.30!

277
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,208
Bye, see you..

278
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,333
Aye Tammy..

279
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,958
This is our only chance
to get even with Grover.

280
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,750
Despite being innocent, dad's...

281
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,250
...been in jail for the past 8 years.

282
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,000
I will give my life
for Manohar you know that.

283
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,875
He was my best friend Charlie,
he was my best friend.

284
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,292
And if he wasn't in jail today...

285
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,583
...all of us would
have been working together.

286
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,917
That's what I'm asking of you,
to work together.

287
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,708
Like how dad and you together
made the Shalimar safe,

288
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,500
& during testing
only one man opened...

289
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,458
...it without knowing the combination,

290
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,333
in 22 minutes.

291
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,667
You Tammy!

292
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,000
Don't do this for me...

293
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,417
...do this for dad please.

294
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,125
Aye Tammy?

295
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,000
Guys I have to pack my bag don't I?

296
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,250
Come on!

297
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,292
Take this!

298
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,917
Go Die!

299
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,375
Where is he? Where is he?

300
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,708
Mama, I told you to pack my suitcase...

301
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,875
...not throw it out!

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,042
Yes I'm your father's slave is it?

303
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,375
Take this, your undies and boxers,

304
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,875
I've washed it and kept it ready.

305
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why are you embarrassing
me in front of everyone mama?

306
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,417
And listen,
wash your undies before you wear them,

307
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,875
wash them everyday,

308
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,042
Don't flip it inside out and
wear them else it will get real itchy!

309
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,750
Keep quiet please!
- Go on now!

310
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,375
Listen you better
go pee before you sleep..

311
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,583
Aye mamma!

312
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,583
Otherwise you'll have
to wash the bed-sheets too.

313
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,125
Can't we live without this fatso?

314
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,208
Are the two of us not enough?

315
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:19,625
Even the three of us are not enough.

316
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,292
Why? You're putting
together a cricket team?

317
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,708
Jag!

318
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,875
Charlie, step on it!

319
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,792
Come on hurry.. hurry..

320
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:28,750
Bye, girls.

321
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,333
Bye, Tammy.

322
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,333
Now he wants one more person..

323
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,250
Why?

324
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,333
Coz 3 levels of Shalimar
are completely computerized.

325
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,500
We need a hacker.

326
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,250
Ya?
Do you know a hacker?

327
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes..

328
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,417
He's a friend's nephew called...

329
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,500
He's bald?

330
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,042
How is it of any
help to us if he's bald?

331
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,583
Arreyy called, not bald!

332
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,375
Why haven't you gone to
the doc to clean up your ears?

333
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,292
Jag, your nephew, Rohan!

334
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,417
Rohan?
- Hmm..

335
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,583
Here goes one more introduction!

336
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,583
And this is Rohan...

337
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:01,917
Aahh not this stud...

338
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,125
...the guy standing behind him.

339
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,250
Rohan Singh,
nephew of our Captain Jagmohan!

340
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,375
Rohan has 600 friends on Facebook.

341
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,250
But not even one in real life.

342
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,250
Coz IQ doesn't interest girls,
they want CQ..

343
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,750
Cool quotient!

344
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,292
Don't even try!

345
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:17,625
Dolly & Polly...

346
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,833
...don't mingle with losers!

347
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,125
"Sorry, I want to.."

348
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,167
Oh my god, its our favorite song!

349
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,333
"I am Punjabi."

350
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,917
No one knew though that
this loser of the real world..

351
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,208
..was HACKGOD RS of the virtual world.

352
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,750
HACKGOD RS has just
2 things in his life.

353
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,542
Number 1-hacking...

354
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,792
...and number 2-hacking.

355
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:51,625
What are you playing?
- I didn't.. - What is this?

356
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,750
Stop.. stop..
- Hold on.

357
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,083
You are such a loser.

358
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,500
Come on, let's go.

359
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,667
Jerk.

360
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,000
Save me..

361
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,542
Please, save me!

362
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,542
I think I've seen this scene before..

363
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,125
Hmm.. from the film 'Damini'

364
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,042
Ahh that '2.5 kg fist' scene, yes.. yes!

365
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,083
Now see Jag's 5 Kg fist.

366
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,208
Hey, Jag Uncle!

367
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,833
So happy to see you!

368
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:28,875
Come here.

369
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,000
Hey big guy!

370
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:31,167
Leave the kid alone!

371
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,333
Peter!

372
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,667
Thank you.

373
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,083
Come to mama honey.

374
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,042
What?

375
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,917
He said your mother is Horny!

376
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,750
What did you say?

377
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,250
Come to mama honey!

378
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,375
You called my Mother Horny?

379
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,708
Whose mother?

380
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,250
You?

381
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:00,333
Sleeves?

382
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,833
Its past my dinner time,
my sugar levels are dropping!

383
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,167
I swear on my mom I
didn't take your mother's...

384
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:22,292
You are talking about my mother again!

385
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,000
Rascal You ate my banana?

386
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,417
This is the only place you
found in the whole damn street?

387
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,208
Go there and fall!

388
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:33,125
Sorry uncle!

389
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,417
Shut up!

390
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,292
See this.
- Awesome what is this network?

391
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,375
Will tell you later,
first tell me, can you hack it?

392
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,583
See, Charlie, this is
an extremely secure network,

393
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,375
if I start working
on it tomorrow then...

394
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,417
I'm telling you Rohan,
this work is illegal.

395
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,458
Haaan!

396
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:54,083
Pinky, Pamma,

397
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,708
Bubbly, Lovely,

398
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,875
Sweety, Tinny.

Guys, don't say 'Mamma'..
He will hit us!

403
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,167
What's there what's

404
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,042
AAhhhh..

405
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,500
..strawberry milk shake, yeah!

406
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:31,000
Peter! You've come back?

407
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:44,417
Why do you keep falling next to me?

408
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,250
What should I do uncle?
He keeps throwing me here!

409
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,750
Jaswinder !

410
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,292
Jaswinder!

411
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,000
Jaswinder!

412
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,750
*&^%$##***^&^&^

413
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:16,875
MAATAJIIII!!

414
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,333
What did he say?

415
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,833
Damn he abused your mom in Chinese!

416
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,292
MAATAJIIII!!

417
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,042
This is a really dangerous place.

418
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,000
A person can't even eat in peace.

419
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:41,375
What's there what's
there what's there?

420
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,708
Ahhhhh Pineapple cake!

421
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,417
I am gonna have my
cake and eat it too.

422
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:48,917
Ooiiii Maa!

423
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,042
Maa?

424
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:52,958
We've said that you work
for us in our software company...

425
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,458
Peter?

426
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:10,667
Is that you?

427
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,417
Peek-a-Boo!

428
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,625
Jag uncle, help him!

429
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,792
Ok. ok..

430
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,708
Jaaagggg!

431
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,000
They are saying your mother..

432
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:27,458
Your mother is a $#@**!

433
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,042
Maa always works!

434
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:55,833
I've understood the plan it's
All clear! But there is one problem.

435
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,667
I will hack the
computers of this vault...

436
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,750
...but how will you
guys get inside the vault?

437
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,250
There is a biometric lock there.

438
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,875
Aye hacker, talk in layman terms!

439
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,833
What he means is, the door
of the room that this vault is in...

440
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,333
...opens only with fingerprints.

441
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,125
Actually...

442
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:11,875
...with the thumbprint of just one Man.

443
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,042
Who's thumbprint?

444
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,625
His thumbprint.

445
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,292
Vicky Grover, Charan Grover's son?

446
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,708
Vicky Grover?
- Yeah!

447
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,000
Vicky Grover?

448
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,375
Vicky Grover?

449
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,708
Peter?

450
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:24,750
We will take it from here.

451
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,958
Okay!

452
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,667
Come on, Charlie, its a bloody joke.

453
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,583
Come on, Tammy, don't over react.

454
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:31,542
I Have a plan.

455
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,333
Plan?

456
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,083
You intend on roping
in Vikki Grover?

457
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,458
Actually, yes, something of that sort.

458
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,750
Radhe! Radhe!

459
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,875
Radhe! Radhe!

460
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,625
Hail Lord Krishna!

461
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,333
Radhe! Radhe!

462
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,333
Hail Lord Krishna!

463
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,125
Nandu Bhide is The Man!!!

464
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:22,000
Hey, where is Nandu's bottle?!

465
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,250
Guys! I present to you... Vikki Grover!

466
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,125
Aka Nandu Bhide!

467
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,667
Bloody hell, Double role!

468
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,083
Oh My God! It's like a movie!

469
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,250
Where did you find him?

470
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,458
Last year I saw him in the Ram-Leela.

471
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,250
He was playing the
role of Lord Hanuman.

472
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,708
I saw Ram-Leela once...

473
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,250
...& got blessings for a lifetime!

474
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,917
Superb, Charlie.
- Bless me!

475
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,125
So be it!

476
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,292
Have the liquor and break the pot.

477
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,958
Have the liquor and break the pot.

478
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,625
Have the liquor and break the pot.

479
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,250
Have the liquor and break the pot.

480
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,917
Have the liquor and break the pot.

481
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:22,083
Its essential that you know
two things about Nandu Bhide..

482
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,292
One.

483
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,375
He can throw up anytime.

484
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,583
Jump up anytime?
Is he a gymnast?

485
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,875
Not jump up...
Throw up!

486
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,625
And the second thing?

487
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,917
Second thing?

488
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,708
See it for yourself.

489
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,292
Nandu, no.

490
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,917
Oh God.

491
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,667
Control.

492
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:09,250
Waste of time, guys!
How can we trust him?

493
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,417
He will ruin the entire plan!

494
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,250
Without him there is no plan!

495
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,833
If we want to get into
Shalimar then we need this face.

496
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,125
This one, this.

497
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,458
Ewwww..

498
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,917
Guys, We need him!

499
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:22,375
Feed him?
- No, Not feed him.

500
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,125
But why should we feed him?

501
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,333
Look, he's so hopelessly drunk!

502
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,375
What do you guys think?

503
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,167
He will risk his life for us?

504
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,083
Never!
- Exactly!

505
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,958
He has no reason to.

506
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,667
Charlie, No motivation.

507
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:35,667
No crime!

508
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,250
Furthermore, he is so useless...

509
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,583
...and he really stinks, Charlie.

510
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,292
How do we make a gentleman
out of this trash?

511
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,667
Charlie, I've heard about
sex change operations...

512
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,042
...but a species change
operation is impossible!

513
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:47,833
Tammy!

514
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,958
It's impossible, doctor!

515
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,417
An operation without
money is impossible!

516
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,417
I know that..

517
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,917
I will save up the
money in 1-2 years though!

518
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,583
But where is the time, Nandu?

519
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,667
Mom won't survive for 1-2 years...

520
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:09,333
6 months.

521
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,250
And if it gets later than that...

522
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,042
Hey, Mom, you don't worry okay!

523
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,375
Don't you worry.

524
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,667
Nandu will collect the money.

525
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,458
Nandu will get your tumor operated.

526
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:27,042
Hey you rich, wealthy people!

527
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,750
Hang up your pots, as high as you can!

528
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,292
Nandu will get them.

529
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,083
I'll get them!

530
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,917
Poor Nandu!

531
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,125
His mom has a tumor.

532
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,833
But guys we now have a reason...

533
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,125
...his mother's operation.

534
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,500
Here's to motivation guys.

535
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,458
Cheers to Nandu!

536
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,542
Team Diamonds!

537
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,125
A Drunken Wastrel...

538
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:03,333
A Wild Boar...

539
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,667
A Heavy Duty Soldier...

540
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,250
And an Impish Kid!

541
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,292
I had carefully handpicked these...

542
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,167
... Charlie's Angels!

543
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,083
This is Manohar's old workshop!

544
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,958
We used to work here years ago..

545
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:21,958
Hey, Jag?

546
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,375
Remember this Lathe Machine?

547
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,125
I can't believe it.
Everything is still the same, Tammy.

548
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,792
Hmmm. The Destruction
of Charan Grover should begin..

549
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,500
..where is left us destroyed.

550
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,042
We begin our work today, guys.

551
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,333
But what are we going to do here?

552
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,083
Rehearsal!

553
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:46,708
Rehearsal of the
World's grandest heist!

554
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,833
We are going to rob this cupboard?

555
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,250
Abode of the underground Goddess!

556
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,833
Ladies...

557
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,208
...welcome to Shalimar!

558
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,625
Gentlemen!

559
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,667
Welcome to Shalimar!

560
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,042
First point,...

561
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,292
...Shalimar's 100 feet long corridor.

562
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,292
At the very entrance we have...

563
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,792
...specially trained
Black-Cat commandos.

564
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,208
They kill first...

565
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:32,583
...and doubt later.

566
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:36,667
These commando's are trained
by the Mossad or the KGB.

567
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,125
And Nandu will go through
this very corridor.

568
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:41,792
What? What? What?

569
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:44,583
You think I am these
big brutes brother in law...

570
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,792
...that they will let me go in?

571
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,125
No! Not their brother in law..

572
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,042
They will think you are Vikki Grover.

573
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,208
Meaning?
- Tammy?

574
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:56,042
Charan Grover's son.

575
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,292
Damnnnn double role.

576
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,250
Same to same, color Xerox!

577
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:09,250
How's it possible though?
My dad never went to Dubai.

578
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,792
His dad must have come to India!

579
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,500
Yes that's possible...

580
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:17,708
Hey!

581
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,083
This is the biometric security.

582
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,542
This lock can open with
the fingerprints of just one man.

583
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:26,333
And he is...

584
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,583
Grover!

585
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,375
Vikki Grover!

586
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:31,917
The key to Shalimar!

587
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,542
Wassup daddy cool?
- All well!

588
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:40,083
Vikki Grover.

589
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,083
Now where will we get Vikki
Grover's fingerprints from!

590
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,958
That's not a big problem.

591
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,667
The big problem is,

592
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:51,333
how are we going to transform
Nandu into Vikki Grover?

593
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,667
Mission impossible.

594
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,667
Such a big safe?

595
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,625
Hmm..

596
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,208
Tammy's true Love!

597
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:10,208
Shalimar!

598
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:17,500
"My true love,"

599
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,917
"Shalimar.."

600
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:25,875
"Until we meet..."

601
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:29,667
"...we both are restless."

602
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,208
"In our eyes the wait is endless."

603
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:35,750
49 levers, 7 cycles,

604
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,458
145 tumblers.

605
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,333
Stop Tammy!
- What happened?

606
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:42,292
In the real Shalimar,
there is an outer laser shield...

607
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:44,042
...which is 12000 volts.

608
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,917
The codes to this outer
laser shield are changed everyday!

609
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:03,875
Who's going to stop
this electric current now?

610
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:05,208
My father?

611
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,792
But he never went to Dubai did he.

612
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,625
Hey you listen,
Don't go on my dad!

613
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,667
Guys.. guys.. Nandu?

614
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,875
Tammy?
- Sorry!

615
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,625
The laser-shield is computerized.

616
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,042
So it will be hacko-fied!

617
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:15,833
Yaaaooo!

618
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,583
So, gentlemen!

619
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:21,500
This is the world
famous Shalimar safe.

620
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:24,708
It has more than 110
million combinations!

621
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,625
110 million!

622
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:28,542
If you start trying today...

623
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:31,458
It will be 350 years before you've...

624
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:34,083
...tried all combinations,

625
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,250
and it still won't open.

626
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,458
Mr. Gupta?

627
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,667
Would you step in, please?

628
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:02,167
So to open Shalimar without the codes,
it will take you 350 years.

629
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:04,167
But you will have only...

630
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,583
5 minutes.

631
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,625
The door of the safe will
remain open for just 5 minutes.

632
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,917
And in these 5 minutes, If we
don't escape with the diamonds then..

633
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:12,583
Then?

634
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,875
The door will automatically shut
and the laser shield will come on!

635
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,125
Oye.. oyeeee!

636
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,458
Step back. Please.
Thank you so much.

637
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:26,833
Which means even if somehow
a thief comes in, he has no way out!

638
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:30,667
Mister Gupta?

639
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,458
There is oxygen inside..

640
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,833
Keep breathing.

641
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,792
As you can see, apart from me...

642
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,875
...no one can take out your
diamonds from Shalimar.

643
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,625
And trust me...

644
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm not a thief!

645
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,833
You guys know the way out!

646
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,125
Apart from this,
there is no other way in!

647
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,583
There is a way.

648
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,167
A way...

649
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,083
...that even Grover is unaware of.

650
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,417
Which way?

651
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:01,792
Shalimar is a 150
feet below Atlantis.

652
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:05,292
And this is where the sewer
system of Atlantis is as well.

653
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,333
So-oar?

654
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,250
Sewer as in a gutter!

655
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,125
Not a dirty pig like you!

656
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,542
Shalimar's greatest
weakness is its ventilation!

657
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,083
Meaning?

658
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,542
Air flow.

659
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:17,417
It's tight!

660
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,375
There was an old A/C
duct here for air supply.

661
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,042
One vent of this duct is still...

662
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,292
...somewhere behind the panel,
in the walls of Shalimar.

663
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,625
Me and Tammy will
reach behind this panel...

664
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:29,292
...and Nandu you, disguised
as Vikki will open this panel...

665
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,917
...so both of us can come in.

666
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,083
How?

667
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:34,250
With this Allen Key,

668
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,458
I mean with this Key, Nandu.

669
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,667
There are special grooves in this,

670
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,042
with which the panel
will open with ease.

671
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,750
Where did you get this from?

672
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,333
In the thousands of
hands that made Shalimar..

673
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,750
There were also those 2 hands,

674
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:01,292
that were mapping & plotting
the destruction of Grover.

675
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,792
Aye Charlie, you are a genius!

676
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:09,958
Superb!

677
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:12,375
Alright.

678
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,792
Thank you, Nandu. That's enough.

679
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,333
Okay, Charlie...

680
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,125
How will the two of us reach
the other side of the panel?

681
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,125
We will reach the other side
of the panel through the AC duct.

682
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:27,667
See, the AC duct begins here,
and comes till here.

683
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,542
Years ago,
these used to be pump rooms..

684
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,750
For air conditioning.

685
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,250
But now these rooms have
been renovated into green rooms..

686
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,417
..for live events, performances that are
held here at the Atlantis.

687
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,625
So this AC duct has one opening here...

688
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,333
...and the other opening is...

689
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,458
...here, in Room 9C.

690
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:46,250
There are 1539 rooms in Atlantis..

691
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:49,875
..but there is only one
way to get into Shalimar,

692
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,750
and that is through...

693
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,583
...Room 9C.

694
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:56,125
Perfecto!

695
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:59,042
So, we will go to Atlantis, Book 9C...

696
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,042
...and directly check into the Shalimar!

697
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,542
Correct?

698
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,583
Errr..

699
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,375
Actually..

700
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,000
its not that simple, Tammy.

701
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,167
The thing is...

702
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,750
Room 9C is already reserved.

703
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,083
Reserved?

704
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,500
6 months in advance?

705
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:17,583
Yes.. No..

706
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,125
I.. No.. Not exactly like that...

707
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,417
Charlie, I've understood!

708
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,542
The thing is, another group...

709
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,833
...has already made the
same plan and have booked it!

710
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:27,667
No issues!

711
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,375
We'll meet this guys and
tell them to split 50-50 with us...

712
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,833
...or we'll call the cops!

713
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,875
No. No. No.
This room cannot be booked.

714
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,000
So then how is it reserved?

715
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,375
Guys I told you'll its a green room.

716
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:39,292
If its green or if its black,
how does the color matter to us?

717
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,042
We aren't going there
for our honeymoon?

718
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,917
Charlie boy?

719
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,125
What's cooking?

720
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:47,958
What are you hiding from us?

721
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Its nothing dude, nothing at all..

722
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:52,000
You guys.. okay...

723
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,417
...okay so the thing is...

724
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,792
...the night the
diamonds are in the Shalimar..

725
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:59,000
..that night there is a live
event in Atlantis, a performance.

726
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,375
WDC.

727
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,083
And Room 9c is reserved...

728
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,625
...for WDC.

729
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,792
And if we want Room 9C for ourselves...

730
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,125
...then we have to take part in WDC.

731
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,000
That's it!

732
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,583
Dabboo DC.. Dabboo DC..

733
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,125
Dabboo DC what the
hell is this Dabboo DC?

734
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,083
WDC.

735
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,167
Yes that what is it?

736
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:18,667
Guys, I told you its
a live performance...

737
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,708
...you know its an event WDC..

738
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,583
Wordanchamship.

739
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,000
Excuse me.

740
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,083
He's already deaf...

741
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:29,167
...and we didn't
hear you all that well either.

742
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,083
What did you say?

743
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,000
Didn't hear?

744
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,167
Nothing its just
a Worrllddchammpship.

745
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:35,500
What is a worldddannccshhiippp?

746
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,667
It's a worddannncsshiipppp!

747
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:40,167
What is a worlddannccshhiippp?

748
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:41,208
Say it clearly!

749
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,625
World Dance Championship.

750
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,000
Go H^%* a buffalo!

751
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,000
Sajid Sir!

752
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,917
Is your new film starting?

753
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,833
Guys its!

754
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,000
GUYS?

755
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,292
Director Sir!
Jag here!

756
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:54,833
I've memorized the sequence perfectly -

757
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:55,708
Bomb 2.3.4!

758
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:56,708
Bomb 2, 3, 4!

759
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,708
Hello sir I can't hear you too well?

760
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,333
Now I'll have to go say sorry to mom!

761
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:01,000
Mummy, I am sorry!

762
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,000
Aye Drama Queens!

763
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,542
Aye! What this drama for guys?

764
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,167
It's a small, tiny dance competition.

765
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:08,000
That's it!

766
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:10,333
What do you mean by that's it!

767
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,833
This is not a dance competition...

768
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:13,500
...this is the World Dance Competition.

769
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:14,542
Ya so?

770
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,542
So?

771
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,083
Who amongst us
looks like a dancer to you?

772
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,792
This fatso?
This drunkard? Or this kid?

773
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:19,417
Heyy?

774
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,292
Forgot to mention yourself huh,
Jackson's illegitimate child!

775
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,542
Why you calling me Macmohan?

776
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,917
We'll discuss this later...

777
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,333
First you tell us,

778
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,708
how on earth are we going to
reach this World Dance Championship.

779
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,167
As team India!

780
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,542
Superb!

781
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,167
Aye, Tammy, listen up.

782
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:36,333
This time WDC, India
is happening here.

783
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:37,333
In Mumbai.

784
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,083
And to win that, its not
essential for us to dance well.

785
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:42,500
We just have to go on stage...

786
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:45,000
...and move around
a bit that's all guys!

787
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,833
Yes! And end up making
an absolute fool...

788
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,458
...out of ourselves in front of
the entire country.

789
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,542
Nope..

790
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,000
We will emerge victorious!

791
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,000
Correct, we will look ridiculous!

792
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,750
Idiot.

793
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:57,958
The winner of WDC India
will be decided by Votes..

794
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:01,792
..and we will automatically
get the maximum votes.

795
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,167
From Where?

796
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,667
From here!

797
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:06,833
Rohan?

798
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,375
I'm pointing towards you.

799
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,125
Me?

800
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:13,708
Rohan is going to hack his way in, and
he will get the maximum votes for us.

801
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,000
By hacking the votes.

802
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,167
Damn genius. Why didn't you say before?

803
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:21,083
I'm saying now, am I not!
- That's gonna be easy. I'm in guys!

804
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:23,917
He too is in guys,
Well done, very good go for it!

805
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,542
He's going to hack his way in...

806
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:28,167
...but we guys can't dance!

807
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,792
Talk about yourself, Khali!

808
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:35,667
Charlie, My snake dance
is world famous in Sangam Chawl!

809
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,500
I'll show you?
- See.. that's the spirit got for it.

810
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,167
Yeah very good.
- Aye see!

811
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:42,000
Hey see this, it's so easy, yeah, yeah!

812
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:43,375
I rest my case.

813
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:44,792
Come on, Tammy, Jag!

814
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,958
You guys know that if we
really want to achieve something...

815
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,333
...we can easily do it..

816
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,583
And this is just
a little bit of dancing.

817
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:52,583
We just need a little practice
and we'll get it in a jiffy.. Jiffy.

818
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:55,667
See, we can do this..

819
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:57,208
See

820
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,792
Is there more to it, Nandu?

821
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,208
No that's all there is.

822
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:04,125
That's it, guys. Come on. So simple.

823
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:06,417
Come on, Guys.

824
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,833
Come on, Tammy Come. Okay come!

825
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,125
I got three left feet, Charlie.

826
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,958
More feet better dance!

827
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,292
Right there.

828
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,625
"My heart is restless."

829
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:40,292
"My eyes are waiting."

830
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:42,833
"Life is meaningless.."

831
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:45,250
"..there's no rhythm."

832
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,458
"Come, beloved. Come on."

833
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:55,500
"Let's get into tune."

834
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:59,917
"Let's get into tune."

835
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:10,167
"Let's get into tune."

836
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:14,750
"Let's get into tune."

837
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:29,083
I told Charlie that we
can't dance to save our lives.

838
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,375
I was better off in the army...

839
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:32,667
Arrey arrey arrey!

840
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:35,792
We have to go on stage in 2 weeks
and you guys don't know jack shit yet!

841
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,083
What do you know, you piece of thrash?

842
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:39,000
You called me a piece of thrash?

843
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,000
You tie this bandanna around your neck
and do your snake dance all day long.

844
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,167
You've come for your father's wedding?

845
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:44,708
Hey don't go on my dad.

846
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:45,542
What you going to do about it?

847
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:46,667
What will you do?
- What will you do?

848
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,167
What will you do fatso?
- What will you do?

849
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,792
Here we go again!
- What will you do?

850
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:51,833
Shhhhh!

851
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:53,250
No one has to do anything.

852
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,500
Whatever needs to be done,
Rohan's going to do.

853
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:55,750
Rohan's going to
take care of the votes.

854
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,083
We won't get voted out.

855
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:58,750
Dancing is not a tension.

856
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,083
Uh- actually...

857
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,458
...there is tension.

858
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,958
This time a lot of
teams have applied so....

859
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,750
...there is a judges round
before the actual competition.

860
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:09,000
We are your worst nightmares!

861
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:10,750
This competition is no joke!

862
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,042
We will choose only the best!

863
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,375
And eliminate the rest!

864
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,583
M%*^@$>!

865
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,083
Chuck it, guys!

866
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,542
Guys remove my
duplicate's photo please.

867
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,667
I don't like hitting
myself with darts!

868
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,917
We have to hit him first!
M^%*$@!

869
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,875
Chuck it, Uncle!

870
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:31,792
Why should he chuck it!

871
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,208
Our vengeance should
be full & absolute.

872
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:38,833
Charlie, this plan to
rob the diamonds I understand,

873
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:43,000
but I don't get this fire
of vengeance that's burning in him..

874
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,042
There's some story to all this...

875
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:46,417
...isn't it?

876
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:55,958
This story is about diamonds...

877
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,417
...It was all about...

878
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,000
...a handful of diamonds.

879
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,875
Charlie's father Manohar
& me used to work together!

880
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:08,458
Not colleagues, we were friends.

881
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:11,333
And not friends like you
who poke each other on Facebook..

882
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:13,000
..from Friday to Friday...

883
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:14,542
...real friends!

884
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,833
Friends?

885
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:18,958
We were like family!

886
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,292
When I left the army,

887
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:25,417
Manohar uncle included me
in his family as well!

888
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,583
Both of us used to test his systems.

889
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,167
Dad had the contracts...

890
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:33,083
...for the security
of the entire Diamond Market...

891
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:36,458
And all was very good..

892
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,375
Then Charan Grover
came into our lives.

893
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,500
Charan Grover was a
dealer of African diamonds.

894
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:50,792
He gave dad the contract to make
the most advanced safe in the world.

895
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:52,833
Dad decided to call it.

896
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,792
Shalimar!

897
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:57,708
For dad & these two guys,
it was their biggest project ever.

898
00:50:57,917 --> 00:51:00,167
They took loans from the market...

899
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:02,417
... and after one year
of intense hard work..

900
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,917
...finally Shalimar was ready.

901
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,958
Charan Grover's first
consignment of diamonds...

902
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,542
...was worth 20 million dollars.

903
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,917
20 million?

904
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,708
I still remember...

905
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:16,125
...the night the diamonds
were kept in the safe,

906
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,833
It was New Year's eve!

907
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:18,958
Mr. Grover!

908
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:24,625
I'll request you to please change
the combination of the safe and...

909
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,625
...put in your own fingerprints too.

910
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:31,667
Manohar!

911
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,125
What's the hurry?

912
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:36,625
It's new years eve, enjoy yourself.

913
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:38,083
Have a drink!

914
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:39,000
Come on!

915
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:43,000
Mr. Grover, I can't take
such a big responsibility.

916
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:46,708
Right now, there are 20 million worth
of diamonds in the Shalimar and..

917
00:51:46,792 --> 00:51:48,583
And no one can open it except you...

918
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,042
...I know that.

919
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,000
But you are not a thief..

920
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:53,625
Hmmm?

921
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,667
Come on today is new year.
Come on. Come on.

922
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,083
Come on, happy new year, cheers.

923
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,958
Enjoy!

924
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,333
That night Grover
showed his true colors.

925
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,833
He drugged my Dad.

926
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:13,000
Dad was seeing himself
get ruined with his own eyes,

927
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,000
and couldn't even
lift a finger to stop it.

928
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:17,208
Grover stole his own diamonds..

929
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,792
..and then called the police.

930
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:21,917
The cops found dad's fingerprints
on the biometric lock.

931
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,792
Grover took the diamonds..

932
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:26,958
..and then he got the
insurance claim too.

933
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:30,083
Dad was boycotted by
the entire Diamond Market.

934
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:32,917
And he got arrested.

935
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,750
Dad was jailed for 12 years.

936
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:40,292
Rigorous imprisonment.

937
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:43,375
He wasn't allowed
to meet anyone...

938
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,667
Jag & Tammy also had to leave
the city incase the cops got to them.

939
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:53,417
I was left to fend for myself...

940
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:59,083
And Charan Grover, who ruined us all -

941
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:03,917
...went to Dubai and solely took
over Shalimar International and today..

942
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:07,208
...is living a life of immense
luxuries and colossal comforts.

943
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,542
He's got fate on his side!

944
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,458
Fate is a fickle mistress, Nandu!

945
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,625
It can turn tables anytime!

946
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,708
This time I'm going to
send Charan Grover to Jail..

947
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,917
..for a very long time.

948
00:53:26,292 --> 00:53:27,917
Hear. Hear!

949
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,375
He'll go.

950
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,792
He'll surely go, Charlie.

951
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,583
Why didn't you tell me before..

952
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,667
..that this is all about your dad?

953
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:43,750
I'm here for my mom..

954
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,292
..and you're here for your dad!

955
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:49,625
We are both bound by our grief.

956
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:51,333
Thank you.

957
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,000
Brother...

958
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,708
I kiss you!

959
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:56,292
Kiss...

960
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:57,458
What kiss?
- Kiss please.

961
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:58,667
No, no, you can't kiss me, Nandu!

962
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,375
No, no, you can't kiss me.
- One kiss, please!

963
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:01,375
What is he saying, guys?
- Charlie..

964
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:02,625
No please!

965
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:03,625
Charlie..

966
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,208
I swear on my mother...

967
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:08,458
...you guys are a heartless bunch.

968
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,792
You take me into your flashbacks
and make me sentimental,

969
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,417
and after that, Charlie,
you won't let me give you one kiss?

970
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,917
Hey just cut it out!

971
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,500
Here we are so tense
about the dance competition...

972
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:17,750
...and all you are worried
about is a damn kiss!

973
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,458
Of course, you'll be tense!

974
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,042
You know why?

975
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,458
Coz you guys are
learning it all wrong!

976
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:24,667
Charlie...

977
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,125
...does anyone learn
how to dance like this?

978
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:29,167
1.2.3.4..

979
00:54:29,292 --> 00:54:30,542
Damn you!

980
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:34,375
Dance is automajic.

981
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:35,708
Automajic!

982
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,708
I will get...

983
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:40,417
...a dance teacher for you guys,
Charlie, come let's go.

984
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,000
Aahaan..Don't touch me.

985
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:43,875
Where do we have to go?

986
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:46,042
Where...

987
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,833
...there is golden
liquor in our throats..

988
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:52,625
Sparkling Radiance in our
hearts and in front of us we have..

989
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:53,750
Mohini..

990
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,708
Mohini..

991
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:55,500
Mohini..

992
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,333
Mohini..

993
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,042
Mohini..

994
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:24,875
"Hearing your name,
my heart beats."

995
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:28,792
"Hearing your name,
my heart beats."

996
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,583
"O beloved, O love."

997
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,792
"O life, O luck."

998
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,250
"O beloved, O love."

999
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,167
"I am more beautiful now"

1000
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:49,417
"By saying your name."

1001
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,625
"By saying your name."

1002
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,625

1003
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:53,667

00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:02,708
"By saying your name."

1010
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:03,500
"Your name."

1011
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:08,500
"My beloved has returned to me"

1012
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:11,750
"My beloved has returned to me"

1013
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:17,167
"My beloved has returned to me"

1014
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:20,625
"My beloved has returned to me"

1015
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,625
"These red bangles of mine"

1016
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,833
"Ring out for you"

1017
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:29,167
"They dance for you,
sing out for you."

1018
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,917
"Such an intoxication."

1019
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,042
"In your anticipation."

1020
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,667
"One touch is all it took"

1021
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:38,167
"I'm yours forever now."

1022
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,208
"I am more beautiful now"

1023
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:41,375
"By saying your name"

1024
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,583
"By saying your name"

1025
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,458
"I am more beautiful now"

1026
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:45,667

"She's put kohl in her eyes."

1041
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:08,833
"Looking at me she's gone mad."

1042
00:57:08,917 --> 00:57:11,000
"Having taken photo and autograph."

1043
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:13,125
"She keeps liking
the pics on instagram."

1044
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:15,083
"O girl, what you are doing?"

1045
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:17,333
"Please leave my friends alone."

1046
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:19,667
"Listen girl you have gone mad."

1047
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,708

"I'm yours until the morning comes"

1057

"Listen to the song in my heart"

1058
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
"who knows about tomorrow?"

1059
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:51,208
"Tell me your joys and sorrows"

1060
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:55,042
"I know its kind of crazy
but I am yours forever now."

1061

Tell me, Mohini,
will you come teach us how to dance?

1086
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:54,000
Hey..

1087
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,417
...you think its easy
to dance like Mohini?

1088
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,042
It's not easy!

1089
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:01,083
There are just 2 people
in the world who can do it...

1090
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:03,292
One is JLO, the other is Shakira!

1091
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:06,333
There is no dancer like
Mohini in the whole of India.

1092
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:09,000
You are not going to get
such a chance in your whole life!

1093
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,667
You will be on TV, girl, on TV!

1094
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,000
With you guys?

1095
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:14,375
Will make a fool
out of myself for sure!

1096
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:16,958
That will be the
End of my dance school.

1097
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:18,083
School?

1098
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:19,917
Hey Dimwit!

1099
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:22,500
Mohini doesn't dance here for joy!

1100
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:24,958
I want to earn some money
And open my own school.

1101
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:28,500
I want to teach small,
Tiny kids how to dance.

1102
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,500
What will you get out of that?

1103
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:32,458
Respect.

1104
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:35,000
Something that no girl here gets.

1105
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,667
You know, my mom used to say...

1106
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:40,042
...the most important
thing in life is respect.

1107
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,250
I will teach you guys how to dance?

1108
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,750
Dance is worship...

1109
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
...dance is an art! Art!

1110
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,583
Where did I say it's a fart!

1111
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,167
Out.. Out!

1112
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:52,375
Get out of here.

1113
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,750
Troubling me since childhood.

1114
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,042
Hey, Mohini!
Don't get upset c'mon..

1115
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:57,917
Relax, Nandu! Don't force her.

1116
00:59:58,083 --> 00:59:59,292
There's no compulsion.

1117
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:01,000
Mohini.

1118
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:03,625
We really appreciate
You taking out time for us...

1119
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:04,958
He speaks in English!

1120
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:12,667
"I've got a feeling!"

1121
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:15,708
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious...

1122
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:19,292
I forgot to mention the 2 things which
Are essential to know about Mohini.

1123
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,125
...Mohini louuuves the English.

1124
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:25,625
...and Mohini can't speak the English.

1125
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,458
Excuse me.

1126
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,333
Yes, Jag?

1127
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,708
He speaks in English?

1128
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:31,708
Yes, Yes!

1129
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:32,667
Full English...

1130
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,500
Charlie!

1131
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:34,875
He's my friend!

1132
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:36,542
I have to teach him too?

1133
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,125
You have to teach him the most!

1134
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:40,250
He is the captain of our team!

1135
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:44,958
Text me the address...

1136
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,083
...I will be there tomorrow at 9.

1137
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:47,875
Hey, Mohini!

1138
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:50,792
Charlie, she's agreed!

1139
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,708
Charlie!

1140
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,000
His name's 'English' too!

1141
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:05,042
The question is not about who she is,
what she is...

1142
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:06,542
...or what she does?

1143
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:10,125
What matters, is what she is for us?

1144
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,208
And for us,
she is just a teacher.

1145
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:14,667
Hmm?

1146
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:18,042
Who will make us rehearse
from 9 in the morning...

1147
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,500
...to 6 in the evening, that's it.

1148
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,000
From 9 am to 6 pm...

1149
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:25,958
...we will forget
what she actually is.

1150
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:28,042
Yes, yes, yes, Jag I know what she is.

1151
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:30,042
She's a bar dancer who
wears these teensy weensy,

1152
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:31,667
..short, sexy clothes...

1153
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:35,500
...and dances in front of
random men for money.

1154
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:37,167
But what really matters, Tammy?

1155
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:39,208
We have nothing to
do with her personal life.

1156
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,458
What difference does it make to us?

1157
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,667
She is our teacher...

1158
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:45,500
And it's important that we respect her.

1159
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:49,042
And you specially Nandu, you
too are cheap like her aren't you. Yeah?

1160
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,625
And it's alright.

1161
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,333
She's a call girl...

1162
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:56,417
...she's cheap,
she's vulgar, she's tacky...

1163
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,417
But now she is what she is.

1164
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,292
You understand Rohan,
What I'm trying to say?

1165
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:02,250
Hmm?

1166
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:05,208
What I'm trying to say Charlie,
is that she is standing behind you.

1167
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:06,792
No!

1168
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,000
Yes!
- No.

1169
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,750
Charlie!

1170
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:28,500
Mohini!
- Enough!

1171
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,250
Mohini has been dancing in front of...

1172
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:32,875
...drunk strangers since two years,

1173
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:38,375
but no one has ever
made me feel so cheap.

1174
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:41,667
Thanks.

1175
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:43,708
Mohini!

1176
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:49,042
Charlie...

1177
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,208
...apologize in English!

1178
01:02:52,042 --> 01:02:54,042
Hey, Mohini, listen up..

1179
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,792
Hey, stop please Mohini
Please, please, stop..

1180
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,000
Stop, please!

1181
01:02:58,042 --> 01:02:58,875
I..

1182
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:00,792
I apologize!

1183
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:03,250
I'm really, really very sorry.

1184
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,042
Actually the thing is..

1185
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,625
..you are the only
lady in this group..

1186
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:08,208
Girl, not lady.
- Exactly!

1187
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:09,375
A call girl.

1188
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:12,292
No, you heard this out of context.

1189
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,750
What I was trying to do is
get these idiots to respect you.

1190
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,250
How on earth will they
respect me if you don't.

1191
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:18,292
Who told you that?

1192
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:19,208
I do, I do immensely..

1193
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:23,000
I respect you.
I really respect you a lot.

1194
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:23,833
Really?
- Yes!

1195
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:24,625
Why?
- Why?

1196
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,000
Why respect Mohini?

1197
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:29,250
'Cause Mohini, you
are such an exceptional dancer!

1198
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,292
Perhaps the best in the world.

1199
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,750
Last night when I saw you
for the first time I was mesmerized,

1200
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:38,250
hypnotized, the passion,
the expression, the rhythm.

1201
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:42,208
The movement of your booty,
the beauty of your movements.

1202
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,583
And your big thighs... eyes...

1203
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:47,583
And your hips don't lie.

1204
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:49,500
Mohini...

1205
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:52,500
...you are simply
b****t taking, breath taking.

1206
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,625
Actually Mohini we are
all losers, me too.

1207
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:02,792
And we want to win this competition
and that can't happen without you,

1208
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,750
It's not possible without you.

1209
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,542
I'm ready to do whatever you say.

1210
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:09,500
Anything..
anything just please don't say no.

1211
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:11,458
Nau..
(Nine)

1212
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:14,458
No!

1213
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:17,042
Nau..
(Nine)

1214
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,000
No!

1215
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,000
Nine! Its nine o'clock...

1216
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:25,417
...It's time for rehearsals.

1217
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:29,000
Mohini hate lateness...

1218
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,292
...lateness?

1219
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:32,625
I promise you Mohini..

1220
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,792
...I will never be late in my life!

1221
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,042
Never.

1222
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:11,083
"I've got a feeling.."

1223
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,083
"I've got a feeling.."

1224
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:19,333
"A feeling in my heart"

1225
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:20,542
"That you are..."

1226
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,792
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams.."

1227
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:24,042
"..from the start"

1228
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:26,042
"I've got a feeling!"

1229
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:28,750
"I've got a feeling"

1230
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:34,292
"A feeling in my heart"

1231
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:38,792
"I'll give you my soul,
and my life and we'll never be apart."

1232
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:41,750
"I'm just a traveler from afar"

1233
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:44,625
"I am the light from a shining star"

1234
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:48,958
"I can't be held in your soul,
in your life"

1235
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:51,875
"Or the depths of your heart."

1236
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:55,583
"I've got a feeling.."

1237
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:58,375
"I've got a feeling.."

1238
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:03,833
"A feeling in my heart"

1239
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,958
"That you are"

1240
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:07,125
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams.."

1241
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:08,417
"..from the start!"

1242
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:36,083
"They speak to me,
those eyes of yours"

1243
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:40,958
"Now, I belong to only you,
and of course"

1244
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,833
"You're mine, too."

1245
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:48,000
"Don't tie me up with
your delicate words"

1246
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:50,833
"Don't color my life
with love because,,"

1247
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:56,000
"I can't be yours."

1248
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:59,958
"Someday you will love somebody"

1249
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:03,083
"That somebody could well be me!"

1250
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:09,083
"You are living a
dream in your heart."

1251
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,583
"On the walls of."

1252
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:15,417
"The very walls of."

1253
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:20,958
"The walls of my beating heart."

1254
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:24,083
"Are pictures of you, of your love
Of your soul, only you"

1255
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:26,958
"From the start!"

1256
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:34,792
"My lover plays a game.."

1257
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,792
"My heartbeat sings his name."

1258
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,708
"His eyes meet mine."

1259
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:45,583
"And our love burns like a flame."

1260
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,625
"Your eyes have cast a magical spell."

1261
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:03,458
"Come into my arms just once,
and well."

1262
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:08,667
"I have become yours!"

1263
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:12,417
"The air begins to simmer."

1264
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,417
"And of love, we catch a glimmer."

1265
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:18,000
"We float, we fly,"

1266
01:08:18,042 --> 01:08:23,042
"Into the sky, amongst the stars."
1267
01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:26.208
"I've got a feeling.."
1268
01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:28.292
"I've got a feeling.."
1269
01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:33.583
"A feeling in my heart"
1270
01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:34.583
"That you are"

1267
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:36,708
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams,"

1268
01:08:36,792 --> 01:08:38,625
"from the start."

1269
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,083
"You are the one in my life,
in my soul, in my dreams"

1270
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:47,958
"That you are"

1271
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:50,167
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams,"

1272
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,958
"from the start."

1273
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:53,833
"That you are"

1274
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:56,000
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams,"

1275
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:58,375
"from the start"

1276
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:05,500
"You are the one in my life,
in my soul, in my dreams."

1277
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,375
Welcome to PNB Metlife presents,

1278
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:18,000
India auditions-

1279
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:20,083
WDC!

1280
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:24,042
As you can see, the top dancing
teams of India are present here...

1281
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:27,000
But the judges will choose
only 5 teams.

1282
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:28,417
Who will be these teams?

1283
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,792
"These are the Indiawale."

1284
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:38,667
Move..

1285
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,333
"Indiawale."

1286
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:48,000
An epic war is in
progress behind this door!

1287
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:50,750
One by one, like injured soldiers,
people are coming out.

1288
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:52,375
This was a damn good team!

1289
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:54,000
They rejected them too?

1290
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:55,542
These two judges are big jerks!

1291
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:57,583
Our selection is impossible!

1292
01:09:57,833 --> 01:10:00,000
And look at him!
Our captain!

1293
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:03,042
He's the worst dancer
amongst us and he's laughing!

1294
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:04,333
Shameless!
- Team Diamonds!

1295
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,792
Here!

1296
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:09,083
And the next team that's
going in is Team Diamonds,

1297
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,542
The judges haven't selected
a single team till now,

1298
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,042
lets see what happens
with these folks. Good luck,

1299
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,542
All the best..

1300
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:17,042
..to the judges.

1301
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:24,625
Yes.

1302
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:27,833
What the hell was that?

1303
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:29,792
What vulgar positions are these?

1304
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:32,333
How dare you show
us such a vulgar dance?

1305
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:35,333
Vishal sir, Anurag sir,
why are you guys getting angry?

1306
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:37,750
This is completely inspired by you.

1307
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,792
Actually by the two of you..

1308
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:44,083
We saw a video...

1309
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:46,875
And the two of you have taken such
incredible positions in that video.

1310
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:48,458
We were flabbergasted!

1311
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:49,500
Rohan?

1312
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,500
Why don't you see
the video for yourself..

1313
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,833
See it and be double sure.

1314
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:07,417
Anurag sir, pink is so your color...

1315
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:10,542
...and Vishal sir, your hairy back.

1316
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,750
Have your wives seen this video?

1317
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,667
We were thinking of
putting it up on Youtube.

1318
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:19,083
Huh?

1319
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:19,958
No?

1320
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:23,250
So tell me..

1321
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,958
..what do you think
of our positions now?

1322
01:11:26,292 --> 01:11:27,875
Wow!

1323
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:30,625
Yeah..

1324
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:32,958
What?
Team Diamonds is in!

1325
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:34,500
I think the judges have gone crazy!

1326
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:37,333
But don't worry, its your votes
which will decide who goes into the...

1327
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,250
Ahh ahh ahh...

1328
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:41,750
...its your votes which
will decide who goes into..

1329
01:11:42,042 --> 01:11:43,792
Hey my mike, my mike..

1330
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:48,042
India, Be double sure.

1331
01:11:57,333 --> 01:11:59,083
Give them a big hand.

1332
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,375

See the rules are extremely simple.

1335
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:09,625
5 teams will perform here,
and once the performances are over...

1336
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:11,208
...we will open the voting lines.

1337
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:12,958
Exactly one hour after that..

1338
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:15,208
..which ever team
has the maximum votes...

1339
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:16,542
...that team will become-

1340
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:18,375
TEAM INDIA!

1341
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:22,375
And then that team will
go to Dubai to take part...

01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:26,333
...in the World Dance Championship!

1343
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:30,042
Who will be Team India?

1344
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:33,375
Who is going to win

7 minutes.

1346
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,667
You guys have 7 Minutes.

1347
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:47,042
Today, I am not going to
tell you how to perform on stage.

1348
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,250
If you don't tell us who will?
- Disturb not please!

1349
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,292
Okay..

1350
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,500
Sorry.

1351
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:57,333
Who knows if we will be
together after today, or not.

1352
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:01,417
Will we ever get an opportunity
like this again, or not.

1353
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:03,083
But today!

1354
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,083
Stand up, mister!

1355
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:16,417
Today.

1356
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:20,167
Today if each dancer
of this team dances...

01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:24,042
...the best that
he ever has in his life...

these 7 minutes away from you.

01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:56,208

1434
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:18,083
This box is useless!

1435
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:18,833
Hey!

1436
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:20,042
Don't say anything about my lappy!

1437
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,958
Your lappy will get one slappy...

1438
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:22,750
...Hurry up!
- Quiet, Tammy !

1439
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:23,958
Just 2 minutes left for 6 pm..

1440
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:25,250
..after that votes don't count!

1441
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:28,083
I told you guys never
to take this kid in our group.

1442
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:30,333
I'll give him one, Tammy?
- Hurry up kid, hurrry up!

1443
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:32,208
Come on, come on, come on.

1444
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:33,667
Guys take it easy, don't worry.

1445
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:34,667
Guys..

1446
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,083
Done!

1447
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:37,333
What is this?

1448
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:38,708
Votes!

1449
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:40,792
Let's go, let's go!

1450
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:42,167
I told you he's an intelligent kid.

1451
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,958
Well done, Rohan!

1452
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:45,708
Alright then.

1453
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:50,042
Ladies and gentlemen, PNB
Metlife presents India finals WDC...

1454
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:54,875
...and now the moment that all
of us have been waiting for is here!

1455
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:58,750
In front of you here, on this
Nokia LED Screen, are the votes,

1456
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:01,167
and on the number
one position we have...

1457
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,000
The Dance Angels!

1458
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:04,875
As expected.

1459
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,250
Quiet!

1460
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:09,125
And at the last position,
is Team Diamonds,

1461
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:10,667
As expected.

1462
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:12,333
Rohan what's happening?

1463
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,292
See the damn score!

1464
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:16,708
C'mon be a sport!

1465
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:19,708
And what do we have here?

1466
01:18:19,792 --> 01:18:21,417
Team Diamonds points are increasing!

1467
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,500
People are actually voting for them!

1468
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:24,042
I don't believe what's happening...

1469
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:27,125
...oh my god team diamonds
is going up the chart.

1470
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,458
Quickly they've gone
past the number 4 spot..

1471
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:31,083
..number 3 position..

1472
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:33,000
I do not believe this...

1473
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,625
...Team Diamonds are
now at the second position!

1474
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,833
God! This is going to
be a really close fight...

1475
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:41,875
...and the difference
in votes is diminishing..

1476
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:45,500
And now as per my watch
we have just ten seconds left!

1477
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,792
Alright guys, get ready!

1478
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:48,875
India...

1479
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,667
...countdown with me!

1480
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:51,625
10..

1481
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:53,042
9..

1482
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:54,333
8..

1483
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:55,500
7..

1484
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:56,583
6..

1485
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:57,708
5..

1486
01:18:57,792 --> 01:18:58,833
4..

1487
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,083
3..

1488
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:00,958
2..

1489
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:02,125
1..

1490
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:06,583
Winner!

1491
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:09,208
Yeah.

1492
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:14,542
How did this happen?!

1493
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,208
I do not believe this.
This is a miracle.

1494
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:19,417
Team diamonds has won!

1495
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:21,875
Our Nandu has won.

1496
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:22,917
But what do we do?

1497
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,625
Team Diamond is now Team India!

1498
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:27,500
And this is the team...

1499
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:31,625
...which will now go to Dubai
for the world dance championship!

1500
01:19:34,542 --> 01:19:36,750
India, What have you done?

1501
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:38,417
Charlie! We did it!

1502
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,500
Charlie I can't
Believe that we've won!

1503
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:43,708
They are calling us!
- Come on!

1504
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,208
In this world,
there are two kinds of people...

1505
01:20:01,542 --> 01:20:02,542
Winners...

1506
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:04,042
...and Losers.

1507
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,125
But life...

1508
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:08,875
...gives a second
chance to every loser...

1509
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:13,458
...with which he can redeem himself.

1510
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,500
And this is just half the battle won..

1511
01:20:16,917 --> 01:20:20,000
The show's just begun...

1512
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:21,625
...my friend!

1513
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:58,250
I am beauty on duty Lola Kutty...

1514
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:01,375
...reporting live from
the Atlantis Hotel in Dubai!

1515
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:03,708
Behind me is the
Hungarian team...

1516
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:05,208
...It's like a hot dream.

1517
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:07,375
Oh this year we want to win!

1518
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:08,667
Well to do that you're
gonna have to...

1519
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,917
...get past North Korea
last year's champions...

1520
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:12,833
...oh speaking of which here they are-

1521
01:21:12,917 --> 01:21:14,042
Team Korea!!

1522
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:20,000
Team Korea!

1523
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,375
No soul, very danger!

1524
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:24,208
Dancing like robots only!

1525
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:25,417
Everyone come down...

1526
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:30,583
Let's go!

1527
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,500
Yes...

1528
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:37,917
Mr. Huyi Chuk?
Mr. Huyi Chuk?

1529
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:41,208
Perfectly bad manners!

1530
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,208
Be the Indiawale.

1531
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:52,875
Oh my goodness, looks like Team India
has just arrived.

1532
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,667
Be the Indiawale

1533
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,583
Go back home.

1534
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:11,917
Go back.

1535
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,708
Oh my God they are throwing things!

1536
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:15,167
I have never seen anything like it.

1537
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:18,125
People of a country stopping their
own team from participating!

1538
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:20,917
It tastes sweet.

1539
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:22,875
Hey!

1540
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:24,250
Damn You!

1541
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:27,583
Team India! Welcome to Dubai!

1542
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,500
Actually, not welcome at all!

1543
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:31,958
Why you are here
to shame us like this?

1544
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,250
You talk to me with some respect!

1545
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:37,500
Aye why we go? You home go!
We are here to dance!

1546
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:39,292
Can't you see I am a dancer?

1547
01:22:39,917 --> 01:22:42,708
Hey... Why are you hiding you coward?

1548
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:44,667
Throw now if you can.

1549
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,292
Reply them.

1550
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,958
Everybody settle down!

1551
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:50,042
Please. Enough!

1552
01:22:50,125 --> 01:22:51,250
Enough! Enough! Enough!

1553
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:53,125
You guys, too. Quiet please.

1554
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,250
Wow! What a fantastic entry!

1555
01:22:55,292 --> 01:22:56,500
Tammy?

1556
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:59,208
Nandu, Jag, go and pick up your bags!

1557
01:22:59,292 --> 01:23:00,083
All of you.

1558
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:01,042
You as well.

1559
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:04,292
Please, go.

1560
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,042
Charlie, I was trying
to stop the fight...

1561
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:14,000
You are a complete embarrassment!

1562
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,292
Means?
- Huh!

1563
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:16,958
Tch!

1564
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,250
Are you a complete idiot?

1565
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:41,458
Oh India desk?

1566
01:23:41,542 --> 01:23:42,958
Hello darling!

1567
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:45,292
Team India. Where are our rooms?

1568
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,833
Ahh... The rooms are only for the
team members, not their families...

1569
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:49,792
Sorry, Uncle!

1570
01:23:49,917 --> 01:23:52,125
Uncle? Arrey I am a dancer.

1571
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:53,042
Ahh...excuse me?

1572
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:56,042
Passports, official ID papers,
Team India, Charlie.

1573
01:23:56,917 --> 01:23:58,583
Ohh? Laila!

1574
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,042
Banana?

1575
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:02,458
Even I love bananas.
I eat 12 everyday!

1576
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:03,500
Bananas?

1577
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:04,583
Turn please.

1578
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:06,625
You deaf mule it's Laila, not Banana.

1579
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,375
Thank you.

1580
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:08,292
Welcome!

1581
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:11,458
Charlie!

1582
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:12,375
Charlie!

1583
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:13,625
Charlie!

1584
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:15,042
Uh? Yes?

1585
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:17,333
An invitation from Mr. Grover.

1586
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:19,792
There's a party tonight...

1587
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:21,000
...you'll come right?

1588
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,500
Will you come?
- Of course!

1589
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,458
So we'll be there, too.
- Great!

1590
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:26,042
Nice bag.

1591
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:26,917
Bag?

1592
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,333
Ahh... This is nothing!

1593
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,958
You haven't seen my dresses yet!

1594
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:37,292
&^%$#@**
- Chuck it!

1595
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,458
Thank you very much.

1596
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,208
Hey Chilly Chicken Wait!

1597
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,917
India incoming!

1598
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:47,250
You China. Me India. See this!

1599
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:48,875
Aloo Paratha, Baigan Bartha,

1600
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:50,917
Rasmalai... Karela!

1601
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:54,000
You Chopsuey, Hakka Noodle,
Manchurian, fried rice?

1602
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:55,792
They aren't Chinese, they are Korean.

1603
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:58,833
Charlie, only their names are different,
but they all look the same.

1604
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:00,583
You are extremely vulgar.

1605
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:02,000
Thanks!

1606
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:10,333
Hi

1607
01:25:10,417 --> 01:25:11,583
Huh?

1608
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:13,042
Hi

1609
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:17,167
Hi, how are you,
what is your name?

1610
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,208
Oro.

1611
01:25:18,292 --> 01:25:19,333
No talking!

1612
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,750
Why is he so serious?

1613
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:27,000
Don't laugh!

1614
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:28,417
Meaning?

1615
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,625
He's saying don't laugh!

1616
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:39,375
Charlie, if we don't
go to the party its okay...

1617
01:25:39,542 --> 01:25:41,833
We have to go...
And just the 4 of us will go.

1618
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,625
We won't take Mohini & Nandu along.

1619
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:46,542
I get why Nandu can't come...

1620
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,000
...because Vikki Grover will be there.
It's risky.

1621
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:51,042
But why can't Mohini come?

1622
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:53,667
It's not about if she can come or not?

1623
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:55,917
It's about how she will dress up!

1624
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:59,000
She'll wear her blingy
flashy clothes Eeee!

1625
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,417
She's not a lady guys,
she's a walking talking music video!

1626
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,167
Charlie!!
- No.. no.. no, Tammy!

1627
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,500
Its not about how
dramatic she is...

1628
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:09,792
...it about how she carries herself,
how she behaves, how she talks.

1629
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:12,458
Why does she even
try talking in English?!

1630
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:13,292
Charlie!

1631
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:14,250
1 minute!

1632
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:16,417
If Nandu is a drunkard
from Sangam Chawl.

1633
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,000
Then she too is an exotic
dancer from a bar right?

1634
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,667
Yeah, what's the problem, Rohan?

1635
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,417
The problem is...

1636
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,542
...that she is standing
behind you... Again!

1637
01:26:26,042 --> 01:26:27,833
Ahh shoot!

1638
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Okay?

1639
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:35,000
I'm a drunkard?
She's a dancer?

1640
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:36,542
And you are the
prestigious upper class?!

1641
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,167
What's wrong in that?

1642
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:40,417
You're a drunkard & I'm a dancer.

1643
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,250
And Charlie is the captain.

1644
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,042
We'll do as he says.

1645
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,708
Now, go to your room and sleep!

1646
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:49,750
Sleep!

1647
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,917
And practice tomorrow at 9 sharp!

1648
01:27:07,542 --> 01:27:09,083
Stupid!

1649
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:24,333
Mohini don't feel
bad about Charlie's...

1650
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:28,125
Every girl wants to...

1651
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:30,917
...be loved, respected...

1652
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:32,792
...and treated well.

1653
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:35,667
It's nobody's childhood dream...

1654
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:38,292
...to be a dancer in a bar someday!

1655
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:42,250
If it wasn't for my family problems..

1656
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,500
..I too would have gone
to an English school...

1657
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:48,917
But fate had
other plans.

1658
01:27:52,042 --> 01:27:53,833
Fate is a bloody fickle thing!

1659
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:57,333
It can change sides anytime.

1660
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:01,042
Don't rub salt in my wounds
by talking like Charlie...

1661
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:03,125
Charlie is naive, Mohini...

1662
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:06,083
He doesn't
know how to talk to a girl...

1663
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,083
And you are the first girl...

1664
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:11,083
...who he likes so much...

1665
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:13,333
He does...

1666
01:28:13,542 --> 01:28:16,792
But he's deaf in both
ears as far as love is concerned...

1667
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:22,417
He can't hear his own heart's calling.

1668
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,292
How to make him hear it then?

1669
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,708
By exploding a bomb.

1670
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:29,542
Bomb?

1671
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:30,583
Hmmm.

1672
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:32,292
A huge bomb!

1673
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,750
Mohini Bomb!

1674
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:57,208
Hello my lovely... Muahh

1675
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:59,417
Hey...hey... Guys.. guys.. guys..!!

1676
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:01,417
Vikki Grover!

1677
01:29:03,375 --> 01:29:06,083
Good that drunkard
didn't come here...

1678
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:07,917
If he was here
he would have said...

1679
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:11,042
Hey same to same, color Xerox!

1680
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:12,333
Ehhh! Nandu what are you doing here?!

1681
01:29:12,417 --> 01:29:14,375
I told you not to
get out of your room.

1682
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:16,750
No Hindustani!
Suit Armani!

1683
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:18,833
You deserve to be slapped for this!

1684
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:22,083
Free wine, in this stomach of mine...

1685
01:29:22,667 --> 01:29:25,292
Along with fried duck...

1686
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:26,167
...eat you mother...

1687
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:28,208
Shut up! Behave yourself!

1688
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:32,750
Put him under the table,
give him his drink, here take this!

1689
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:29,625
How am I looking?

1690
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:31,083
Just like a Barbie!

1691
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:33,292
Correct... like my 'bhabhi'!
(sister-in-law)

1692
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:37,375
Hello...

1693
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:40,042
What?

1694
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:42,833
Well, hello my beauty...

1695
01:30:43,917 --> 01:30:45,083
I am Charlie.

1696
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:46,333
Jazzed up Nandu too?

1697
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:47,750
Yeah, team India I presume!

1698
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:49,500
Jhakkass (mind-blowing)
Nandu huh?!

1699
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:50,542
Good stuff!

1700
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:51,500
Jack-ass-Nandu?

1701
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:53,500
Jackass. Yeah.

1702
01:30:53,583 --> 01:30:57,542
Nowadays we don't use terms
like handsome, dude, charming...

1703
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:59,792
Its jackass now, right?

1704
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:00,833
Right, Jag?

1705
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:03,708
Right! And in India 'dudes' are
called as 'Nandu'... Jhakaasnandu!

1706
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:04,500
Jhakaasnandu.

1707
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:06,792
Yeah jhakaasnandu, how do you do?

1708
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:08,375
Yeah, fine.

1709
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:09,792
How about a drink darling?
- No, No, No!

1710
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
English huh? Mind blowing, let's go!

1711
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:14,167
Nandu, Jackass Nandu. I like it!
It's very funny.

1712
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,542
Arey Mohini, ahh Mr. Jackass!!

1713
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:16,708
I now give you,

1714
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:19,625
the magnanimous
host for tonight's wonderful party...

1715
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,792
...Mr. Charan Grover!

1716
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:42,583
Charlie! We have to
keep a low profile now.

1717
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:46,125
Its best if Grover
doesn't notice us.

1718
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:49,125
Mr. Grover! Mr. Grover!

1719
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:50,333
Team India!

1720
01:31:54,792 --> 01:31:56,208
Excuse me!

1721
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:58,708
&^%$#&#...

1722
01:31:58,792 --> 01:32:00,125
Chuck it...

1723
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:02,333
That was close!

1724
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:03,792
Hell, No!

1725
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:06,875
But according to me, the most
shocking team this year is...

1726
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,125
Team India...

1727
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:13,917
...you must have heard about us,
surely...

1728
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:16,792
Team India. Of course!

1729
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:19,542
You were feeling ashamed to meet
your own people,

1730
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:22,458
so we thought we'll
come over and say hello.

1731
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:24,208
What's the matter Mr. Grover...

1732
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:25,583
...you won't welcome us?

1733
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:29,042
Talks of your welcome are echoing
through Dubai!

1734
01:32:30,417 --> 01:32:31,792
It must have been
quite a welcome huh?

1735
01:32:31,917 --> 01:32:34,167
It was quite a welcome, yeah!

1736
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:36,542
Mr. Grover,
we Indians are like this only,

1737
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:39,375
If we like someone we give them our
hearts and make them kings,

1738
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:41,000
and if we don't like someone...

1739
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:42,208
...then tomatoes.

1740
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:46,250
But there's one thing Mr. Grover,
we don't look away while talking.

1741
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,375
They say that people who look
away... have guilt in their hearts.

1742
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:52,375
Hey mister!
- Mr. Kapoor...

1743
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:53,792
...take it easy.

1744
01:32:58,542 --> 01:33:02,417
After all he is our guest,
so what if its just for a few days...

1745
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,250
And we need to put
up a great show hmm?

1746
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:07,917
Anyways going
by their entry,

1747
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:09,792
I'm 100% sure...

1748
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,500
...their exit will be of another level!

1749
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:15,083
India has a track record...

1750
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:17,125
...whether its a
team for the Olympics...

1751
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:19,333
...or a film for the Oscar..

1752
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:22,750
..they always send losers.

1753
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,208
You, what were you saying?

1754
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:26,792
Who will win WDC?

1755
01:33:26,917 --> 01:33:29,333
I don't know who'll win
but I know who'll lose...

1756
01:33:29,417 --> 01:33:31,417
I think you
should put your money on them.

1757
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:35,333
I promise you Mr. Grover,

1758
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:39,125
your happiness at seeing us here now,

1759
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:41,333
will be nothing compared
to your grief...

1760
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:42,625
...once we are gone.

1761
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:45,583
What grieves me is...

1762
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:48,750
...that out of a country
of 1.3 billion people,

1763
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:52,167
'these' are the people
that India has chosen.

1764
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:54,333
Don't you worry...

1765
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:57,208
...we are enough for
you guys.

1766
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:16,000
"Hey, admit it or not."

1767
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:21,250
"We have style,
 yes we are the stars."

1768
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:27,250
"A little bit of this
and a little bit of that."

1769
01:34:27,417 --> 01:34:32,792
"Yeah whatever you say
we are proud of who we are."

1770
01:34:35,542 --> 01:34:40,583
"Its time for the world to recognize."

1771
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:44,458
"Or go ahead and try us on."

1772
01:34:44,542 --> 01:34:48,167
"We're cool, we're smart,
we're the kings of hearts."

1773
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:51,875
"Call us by our names,
sing Indiawaale."

1774
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,583
"We can make your hearts sing,
Indiawaale"

1775
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:59,875
"Winning is just our thing,
Indiawaale."

1776
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,875
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1777
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:10,500
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1778
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:36,583
"We're the good guys, see?"

1779
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:41,708
"Yeah, we do it our way
and we make our own destiny."

1780
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:47,750
"We don't care anyway."

1781
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,208
"Let them say what they want to say."

1782
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:59,208
"Yeah we do what we feel like."

1783
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,292
"Just as long as it feels right."

1784
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:06,875
"For friends in need we're friends indeed,
we stand by them with our lives."

1785
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,583
"Call us by our names,
sing Indiawaale."

1786
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:14,333
"We can make your hearts sing,
Indiawaale"

1787
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:18,583
"Winning is just our thing,
Indiawaale."

1788
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:23,750
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1789
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:29,292
"We'll wrap you around our fingers,
Indiawaale."

1790
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:55,917
"With one look,
with just a single look."

1791
01:36:56,042 --> 01:37:01,542
"In just a moment,
we can win your heart."

1792
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:07,167
"This whole world"

1793
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:09,083
"Will be right at your feet."

1794
01:37:09,167 --> 01:37:11,708
"If you're the person
we choose to love."

1795
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:17,000
"We'll gladly leave the world behind."

1796
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:20,750
"For a space in your heart and mind."

1797
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:22,625
"Because when we love,
we love forever."

1798
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:24,458
"And you can say that again!"

1799
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:28,125
"Call us by our names,
sing Indiawaale."

1800
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:31,792
"We can make your hearts sing,
Indiawaale"

1801
01:37:32,042 --> 01:37:35,625
"Winning is just our thing,
Indiawaale."

1802
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:41,333
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1803
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:44,333
"Do what you like, but don't mess..."

1804
01:37:45,583 --> 01:37:48,167
"We'll wrap you around our fingers..."

1805
01:37:49,375 --> 01:37:54,500
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1806
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:12,000
Sorry!

1807
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:19,167
How did Nandu change
his clothes so fast?

1808
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:20,917
What a star!

1809
01:38:21,042 --> 01:38:24,250
I feel so good after throwing up...

1810
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:26,750
Stop Burping!

1811
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:27,792
Bloody pig!

1812
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:29,500
I told you not to get this drunkard!

1813
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:31,542
And I told you not to leave him alone.

1814
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:32,625
It's all your fault!

1815
01:38:32,708 --> 01:38:34,208
What? My fault?

1816
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:35,792
Why did you come to the party?

1817
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:37,667
Rubbish!

1818
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:41,458
Firstly, you didn't take care of me,
and now you're fighting with Charlie?

1819
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:45,208
Think loudly,
this deaf mule didn't hear a word.

1820
01:38:45,292 --> 01:38:46,583
Rubbish!

1821
01:38:46,667 --> 01:38:50,333
Firstly, you didn't take care of me,
and now you're fighting with Charlie?

1822
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,917
I'd love to fight
& get physical with him.

1823
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,083
You Shut up!

1824
01:38:54,167 --> 01:38:55,583
You pant down!

1825
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,583
Shhh! Guys!

1826
01:38:57,667 --> 01:39:00,000
Don't think so loudly.

1827
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:01,375
Mohini will hear us!

1828
01:39:01,917 --> 01:39:07,667
I'm more beautiful
now by saying your name...

1829
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:08,958
Your name...

1830
01:39:09,042 --> 01:39:10,208
Your name...

1831
01:39:10,292 --> 01:39:12,375
Your name...

1832
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:16,375
Mohini! Your floor is here.

1833
01:39:16,542 --> 01:39:18,958
That was quick!

1834
01:39:19,625 --> 01:39:21,000
I want to...

1835
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:22,667
Eat you!

1836
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:25,292
Good nights!

1837
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:28,542
Not a word guys!

1838
01:39:28,708 --> 01:39:31,292
Not.. a.. word!

1839
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:33,833
Tomorrow,
I want to go over the plan again.

1840
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Gentlemen!
Welcome to Mission Merry Christmas!

1841
01:39:39,875 --> 01:39:42,708
The Diamonds will be in Shalimar by
tomorrow evening.

1842
01:39:42,792 --> 01:39:43,958
Understood?

1843
01:39:46,042 --> 01:39:48,167
Very good, Tammy.
Rohan continue...

1844
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:50,708
Starting point of the mission
Room 9C.

1845
01:39:50,792 --> 01:39:53,708
Problem is, this room can be
allotted to anyone.

1846
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:56,292
But I have allotted room 9C...

1847
01:39:56,333 --> 01:39:57,875
...to team India!

1848
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:04,333
We are performing
3rd in the semi finals.

1849
01:40:04,417 --> 01:40:06,417
There are 5 more performances after us.

1850
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,917
Which means we have a lot of time to
rob the diamonds.

1851
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Go get them!

1852
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,875
We will go on stage and perform.

1853
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:20,708
And the audience will go bananas.

1854
01:40:20,958 --> 01:40:23,000
Story is over. Enjoy.

1855
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:26,125
After our awful dance...

1856
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:28,542
...me and Charlie will
get into the duct.

1857
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,333
Aabraa...
- Ka Dabraa!

1858
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:35,333
While I call Vikki Grover to lift.

1859
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:39,958
It's a piece of cake!

1860
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:42,417
Hello?

1861
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:45,417
Hello Mr. Vikki?... Blah blah blah...
Elevator 3. Come quick.

1862
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,208
Ok sir, right away!

1863
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:52,083
2 seconds after entering the lift,
Vikki is of no use to us.

1864
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:00,125
What we need...

1865
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:01,625
...are his fingerprints.

1866
01:41:07,917 --> 01:41:09,417
Fooled you didn't I?

1867
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,458
I'm not Vikki!
I am Nandu Bhide!

1868
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:15,667
Nandu Bhide is the Man!
Now you watching me speaking English!

1869
01:41:16,333 --> 01:41:17,542
English. English English!

1870
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:18,458
English. English. English!

1871
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:20,542
Let's open the biometric now.

1872
01:41:23,667 --> 01:41:25,542
Aabraa Ka Daabraa!

1873
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:28,583
Meanwhile, Charlie & Fatso...

1874
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:30,333
...will reach the
other side of the Duct.

1875
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:34,875
Which I will open with my allen key.

1876
01:41:35,125 --> 01:41:37,000
Charlie
& fatso will come in...

1877
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:39,000
Abraa ka Dabraa,
Part 2!

1878
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,167
Well done soldier!

1879
01:41:44,375 --> 01:41:46,250
Our mission is a
success because of you!

1880
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,458
I will take Charlie
& Tammy ahead from here...

1881
01:41:53,042 --> 01:41:55,417
...by disabling the laser shield!

1882
01:42:01,667 --> 01:42:04,417
From here, the story is very romantic!

1883
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,458
Temhton Irani's Magic fingers...

1884
01:42:06,542 --> 01:42:08,375
...and Shalimar's safe!

1885
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:17,792
Ho! Ho! Ho!

1886
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:24,583
Mission Merry Christmas!

1887
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:28,500
Uh, I have a doubt...

1888
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:31,708
You'll get in with Nandu's help...

1889
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:34,125
...but how will you get out?

1890
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,333
Just like the way we went in!

1891
01:42:36,458 --> 01:42:37,500
No, Tammy...

1892
01:42:37,667 --> 01:42:40,292
We can't go out the same
way we come in.

1893
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,667
Shalimar is 150
feet below the ground..

1894
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:44,917
..we can go down the duct,

1895
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,125
..but we can't climb back up. No.

1896
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:49,708
But, Charlie, if you don't get out
within 5 minutes,

1897
01:42:49,792 --> 01:42:52,208
the safe autolocks itself..

1898
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,375
..with you inside it!

1899
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,917
The walls are 6 inches of steel!

1900
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,917
And the mesh below has space enough
only for oxygen pipes.

1901
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,542
How will we get out?

1902
01:43:01,667 --> 01:43:04,375
Mummmaaaaaaa!!!!

1903
01:43:06,167 --> 01:43:09,208
How are we going to get out, Idiots!

1904
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:10,583
Jag will get us out.

1905
01:43:10,708 --> 01:43:12,000
This deaf donkey?

1906
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:14,417
What did you think fatso?
Am just a handsome face?

1907
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,875
Who told you you're handsome?

1908
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:17,042
Who told you you'll get out?

1909
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:18,708
Who told you you're not handsome?

1910
01:43:18,792 --> 01:43:21,167
Someone tell me how
we getting out please?

1911
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:22,042
Tammy...

1912
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:24,250
...I told you Jag will get us out.

1913
01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:25,583
You don't trust me?

1914
01:43:25,667 --> 01:43:27,083
I'm going to be there too!

1915
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,375
You'll be taken care of.

1916
01:43:28,458 --> 01:43:31,417
Okay, you two tell me plan.

1917
01:43:31,583 --> 01:43:32,750
Captain Charlie!

1918
01:43:32,958 --> 01:43:35,083
We will get out of
Shalimar and meet at room 9C.

1919
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,583
And we will sulk while we wait for
the bad news!

1920
01:43:37,667 --> 01:43:38,667
Bad news!

1921
01:43:38,917 --> 01:43:40,417
Team India, you are eliminated.

1922
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:41,958
Oh no.

1923
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:44,875
The rules of the competition
are that the losing team...

1924
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,417
...will be escorted to
the airport with their baggage...

1925
01:43:47,667 --> 01:43:50,417
...by the organizers personally.

1926
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:51,708
Bye!

1927
01:43:51,917 --> 01:43:54,083
And we will fly back
to India with the diamonds.

1928
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:55,542
And airport security?

1929
01:44:14,542 --> 01:44:16,000
What are you guys doing?

1930
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,542
C'mon stand up guys, stand up.

1931
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:18,500
What's going on?

1932
01:44:19,333 --> 01:44:21,125
So proud of you, Charlie.

1933
01:44:21,333 --> 01:44:22,958
Genius!! Pure Genius!

1934
01:44:23,042 --> 01:44:24,708
Dad used to say... Keep it simple.

1935
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:25,625
Very simple!

1936
01:44:25,708 --> 01:44:27,208
Alright? Come on
ladies!

1937
01:44:27,625 --> 01:44:28,375
Nandu?

1938
01:44:28,458 --> 01:44:29,292
Huh?
- Up!

1939
01:44:30,167 --> 01:44:30,958
Ladies!

1940
01:44:31,042 --> 01:44:32,750
Let's go practice!

1941
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:47,625
Make sure Nandu doesn't come here
and misbehave like last night.

1942
01:44:47,708 --> 01:44:48,333
Right!

1943
01:44:48,375 --> 01:44:49,792
Night, not right!
- Of course, night...

1944
01:44:49,917 --> 01:44:52,042
...don't worry he's
throwing up in the room.

1945
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:53,500
Mohini's
taking care of him.

1946
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:57,333
Ok everyone, We have to act like
we are rehearsing.

1947
01:44:57,417 --> 01:44:58,208
Tammy, you lead.

1948
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,750
Okay, with the right!

1949
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:01,458
Myeongseong!

1950
01:45:03,292 --> 01:45:04,250
Tradition!

1951
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:05,333
Jeontong!

1952
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,667
Excellence.

1953
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:08,292
Jing-ye!

1954
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,958
Discipline.

1955
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,292
Koreans have such words too.

1956
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:25,542
You're going to get it from me!

1957
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:29,375
He's a kid.

1958
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:31,333
Let him be alright.

1959
01:45:32,167 --> 01:45:32,792
Hey.

1960
01:45:33,917 --> 01:45:34,667
What?

1961
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,000
My team.

1962
01:45:36,292 --> 01:45:36,875
Hey!

1963
01:45:36,958 --> 01:45:38,333
My style.

1964
01:45:45,792 --> 01:45:47,000
Charlie.
- Charlie!

1965
01:45:47,083 --> 01:45:47,875
You hurt?

1966
01:45:47,958 --> 01:45:49,042
No...

1967
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:51,625
But my favorite glares broke.

1968
01:45:52,083 --> 01:45:53,708
I'll get a new one.
- Okay.

1969
01:45:57,542 --> 01:45:58,792
Hey you!

1970
01:45:59,042 --> 01:46:00,292
Glares!

1971
01:46:48,875 --> 01:46:51,125
This Bruce Lee is thrashing him!

1972
01:46:51,208 --> 01:46:53,542
See what our Jackie Chan does now!

1973
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:05,208
"Just see the Kung fu power."

1974
01:47:10,667 --> 01:47:13,083
"Just see the Kung fu power."

1975
01:47:51,875 --> 01:47:56,333
The fight isn't over yet, my friend!

1976
01:48:15,542 --> 01:48:17,000
Sir, should we stop them?

1977
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:18,542
No.

1978
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:24,417
Put India against Korea in
tomorrow's semi final dance off.

1979
01:48:24,625 --> 01:48:27,250
Sir Korea's the best
team and India's the worst.

1980
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:29,333
India will get eliminated
in the first round itself!

1981
01:48:29,375 --> 01:48:30,542
Exactly...

1982
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:32,750
...do it!

1983
01:48:54,417 --> 01:48:56,083
Hey, Charlie.

1984
01:49:05,458 --> 01:49:07,542
Charlie, come on.

1985
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:12,250
Charlie. Come up.

1986
01:49:20,792 --> 01:49:21,958
Charlie, be careful.

1987
01:49:27,417 --> 01:49:29,042
Charlie! Hey, Charlie.

1988
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,500
Hey, Charlie.

1989
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:56,417
Charlie!

1990
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,917
Hey, Charlie, leave him.

1991
01:50:00,042 --> 01:50:02,292
Leave his hand.

1992
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:20,250
Good evening ladies and gentlemen!
I'm your host Dino Morea.

1993
01:50:20,417 --> 01:50:25,375
Welcome to the final word
in the world of dance, the Videocon...

1994
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:29,958
World dance championship!

1995
01:50:30,792 --> 01:50:34,958
In the semi finals, 16 teams will compete
against each other, one on one...

1996
01:50:35,042 --> 01:50:38,250
Of which 8 teams will go through.

1997
01:50:38,375 --> 01:50:43,167
These teams will be selected by our
panel of international judges.

1998
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:47,500
So put your hands together
for the first dance off between...

1999
01:50:47,583 --> 01:50:50,375
...Team Mexico and Team Russia.

2000
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,458
How many times have
I told you right hand!

2001
01:51:10,542 --> 01:51:12,125
How does it matter which hand?

2002
01:51:12,208 --> 01:51:13,458
We are going to lose anyway!

2003
01:51:13,542 --> 01:51:15,333
Hey! It matters!

2004
01:51:15,458 --> 01:51:18,042
If you lose you lose,
but don't lose your respect!

2005
01:51:18,125 --> 01:51:20,375
And I'll break your legs
if you do your snake dance again.

2006
01:51:20,458 --> 01:51:22,167
Don't say anything about my snake dance...
- Shut up!

2007
01:51:22,542 --> 01:51:23,750
Tammy uncle!
- Yes, yes!

2008
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:25,208
Please lift Rohan properly today.

2009
01:51:25,292 --> 01:51:26,750
All lectures for us?

2010
01:51:26,875 --> 01:51:28,875
Nothing for Charlie?

2011
01:51:29,208 --> 01:51:30,250
I'm telling him too...

2012
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:31,500
Excuse me!

2013
01:51:32,667 --> 01:51:33,542
Yeah?

2014
01:51:34,875 --> 01:51:37,125
Take care of...

2015
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,458
...your timing please!

2016
01:51:42,625 --> 01:51:43,875
Sure!

2017
01:51:48,708 --> 01:51:50,125
I feel really bad for her!

2018
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:53,042
She's the only
one worried about the competition.

2019
01:51:53,125 --> 01:51:55,083
Jag, Focus!
Guys!

2020
01:52:21,417 --> 01:52:22,292
Wow!

2021
01:52:22,375 --> 01:52:24,292
What a brilliant performance!

2022
01:52:24,417 --> 01:52:27,208
The next dance off is between...

2023
01:52:27,292 --> 01:52:31,375
... a country that's reached
here for the first time, my country-

2024
01:52:31,458 --> 01:52:34,542
Team India!

2025
01:52:35,167 --> 01:52:39,792
And the number one team of WDC,
the defending champions-

2026
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:43,333
Team Korea!

2027
01:52:49,958 --> 01:52:53,375
"Step ahead, let's see..."

2028
01:52:53,458 --> 01:52:56,667
"Who is Faster, Fitter & Stronger!"

2029
01:52:57,333 --> 01:53:00,792
"Put your best foot forward,"

2030
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,667
"My Friend!"

2031
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:19,083
"Don't know dancing and blames the platform."

2032
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:22,833
"Getting happy acting stupid."

2033
01:53:22,917 --> 01:53:25,250
"Buffalo is going in the water."

2034
01:53:25,375 --> 01:53:26,542
Buffalo's gone in the water!

2035
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:30,167
"If you are a hero, I am superhero."

2036
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:33,500
"If you are a hero, I am superhero."

2037
01:53:33,583 --> 01:53:36,792
"I am feeling alright because
 it is night of nonsense."

2038
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,583
"I am feeling alright because
it is night of nonsense."

2039
01:53:40,875 --> 01:53:44,208
"I am feeling alright because
it is night of nonsense."

2040
01:53:44,458 --> 01:53:47,875
"I am feeling alright because
 it is night of nonsense."

2041
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,333
Come on.

2042
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:59,167
"How will a stupid know
the value of diamonds?"

2043
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:00,833
"How will he?"

2044
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:05,292
"No one notices if you
dance well in your room."

2045
01:54:06,917 --> 01:54:08,667
"Exactly."

2046
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:10,458
"One, who has power, is the king."

2047
01:54:10,542 --> 01:54:12,292
"One, who has power, is the king."

2048
01:54:12,375 --> 01:54:16,417
But remember,
100 Goldsmiths equals 1 blacksmith!

2049
01:54:16,708 --> 01:54:17,458
Meaning?

2050
01:54:17,542 --> 01:54:19,750
100 Goldsmiths = 1 Blacksmith!

2051
01:54:19,875 --> 01:54:21,208
Wah wah!

2052
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,167
Wah wah!

2053
01:54:28,333 --> 01:54:31,583
"I am feeling alright because it
is night of nonsense."

2054
01:54:31,917 --> 01:54:35,208
"I am feeling alright because it
is night of nonsense."

2055
01:54:35,458 --> 01:54:38,917
"I am feeling alright because it
 is night of nonsense."

2056
01:54:39,167 --> 01:54:42,500
"I am feeling alright because it
is night of nonsense."

2057
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:46,333
Come on. - "All is well that ends well."

2058
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:50,083
"All is well that ends well."

2059
01:54:50,292 --> 01:54:54,083
"All is well that ends well."

2060
01:54:54,292 --> 01:54:58,333
"All is well that ends well."

2061
01:54:58,833 --> 01:55:02,083
"I am feeling alright because it
is night of nonsense."

2062
01:55:02,167 --> 01:55:05,833
"I am feeling alright because it
is night of nonsense."

2063
01:55:05,917 --> 01:55:09,583
"I am feeling alright because it
 is night of nonsense."

2064
01:55:09,667 --> 01:55:13,750
"I am feeling alright because it
is night of nonsense."

2065
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,500
Hey.. Charlie.

2066
01:56:01,208 --> 01:56:02,583
Charlie are you alright?

2067
01:56:03,625 --> 01:56:05,833
Charlie.. are you alright?

2068
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:07,292
He fell down from such a height.

2069
01:56:13,667 --> 01:56:16,083
India! India!

2070
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:19,417
India! India!

2071
01:56:20,667 --> 01:56:23,125
India! India!

2072
01:56:26,042 --> 01:56:27,250
Guys let's go.

2073
01:56:30,333 --> 01:56:31,125
Mohini, Mohini.

2074
01:56:31,292 --> 01:56:34,333
We are Sorry! Tammy
got fits, Nandu went mad...

2075
01:56:34,417 --> 01:56:37,292
...and I messed up completely.

2076
01:56:39,083 --> 01:56:40,417
I am sorry...

2077
01:56:41,667 --> 01:56:43,333
...we lost our respect.

2078
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,292
No, Charlie!

2079
01:56:45,583 --> 01:56:49,000
It doesn't matter if we
lose today...

2080
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:52,375
Because you won
everyone's hearts.

2081
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:56,542
Charlie, take this...

2082
01:56:56,625 --> 01:56:58,208
Key to room 9C.

2083
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,250
See you here in an hour?

2084
01:57:01,333 --> 01:57:03,000
Uh yes I'll see you here.

2085
01:57:03,083 --> 01:57:04,333
Why after an hour?

2086
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:05,750
Lets all sit together.

2087
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:07,500
Mohini wants to sit together...

2088
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:09,000
No.. no.. we can't do that...

2089
01:57:09,167 --> 01:57:12,208
I'll go drop Tammy to
his room else he'll collapse.

2090
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:13,542
I'll go take a shower and come.

2091
01:57:13,875 --> 01:57:15,417
Shower, you?

2092
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:16,917
What's cooking guys?

2093
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,917
Actually, Mohini...

2094
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:20,875
...I need to use this green room.

2095
01:57:20,958 --> 01:57:22,667
Someone's coming to meet me...

2096
01:57:23,167 --> 01:57:24,417
Laila's coming.

2097
01:57:25,375 --> 01:57:26,625
Laila?

2098
01:57:31,667 --> 01:57:33,208
Shhh...Mohini?

2099
01:57:33,875 --> 01:57:35,208
Come on, let's go.

2100
01:57:35,333 --> 01:57:37,667
Come on, let's hurry up!

2101
01:57:38,375 --> 01:57:39,583
C'mon guys!

2102
01:57:40,917 --> 01:57:42,125
Guys, it's a go!

2103
01:57:42,208 --> 01:57:43,083
Rohan?

2104
01:57:43,167 --> 01:57:44,208
Tammy, here!

2105
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:46,208
Jag, Nandu, wear your burqas quick!

2106
01:57:46,333 --> 01:57:47,667
Quick.. quick.. quick.. everyone.

2107
01:58:01,125 --> 01:58:03,875
Keep a walkie on an open channel
so everyone can hear what's going on.

2108
01:58:06,292 --> 01:58:08,375
Aunty can you tie this for me please.

2109
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,333
Jag, Nandu.
Get to the lift, quick!

2110
01:58:12,625 --> 01:58:13,792
Ready, sister?
- Yes.

2111
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:23,458
Rohan...

2112
01:58:23,542 --> 01:58:24,958
...call up Vikki Grover.

2113
01:58:28,208 --> 01:58:28,792
Yeah?

2114
01:58:28,917 --> 01:58:30,083
Hello Mr. Vikki?

2115
01:58:30,208 --> 01:58:31,750
This is security
chief Alfredo speaking!

2116
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:32,625
Who?

2117
01:58:32,708 --> 01:58:35,250
Come urgently.
Room 2205. Beautiful girl.

2118
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:37,250
Very pregnant.
Calling you now!!

2119
01:58:37,417 --> 01:58:38,292
What?

2120
01:58:38,333 --> 01:58:39,417
Are you coming? Or I call daddy?

2121
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:42,042
No.. no..
no! Don't call dad! I'm coming!

2122
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:53,083
Yes?

2123
01:58:53,708 --> 01:58:56,375
No, no, no, no. Rain check on
tomorrow's meeting.

2124
01:58:56,458 --> 01:58:58,042
There has been
a change in plan.

2125
01:58:58,125 --> 01:58:59,875
Dad's going to
Pretoria tomorrow.

2126
01:59:00,042 --> 01:59:01,917
Shhh... Tammy, one minute.

2127
01:59:02,417 --> 01:59:03,875
Why is Grover going to Pretoria?

2128
01:59:04,583 --> 01:59:06,375
The diamonds should have
come from Pretoria by now.

2129
01:59:06,458 --> 01:59:07,458
Means?

2130
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,917
Does that mean that the diamonds
haven't reached here yet?

2131
01:59:11,083 --> 01:59:13,792
Exactly! Oh you know, Customs!

2132
01:59:13,917 --> 01:59:16,375
This paper that paper...
All really very painful.

2133
01:59:16,542 --> 01:59:18,125
Diamonds were supposed
to come tonight..

2134
01:59:18,208 --> 01:59:20,250
..but now they will
come on 31st December.

2135
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:21,667
Damn!

2136
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:22,500
What?

2137
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:25,042
Yes, I know, it's New Year's Eve!

2138
01:59:25,125 --> 01:59:26,917
And the finals of WDC!

2139
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,375
It's gonna be chaotic with a big K.

2140
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:30,583
Okay...

2141
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:31,667
See you!

2142
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:33,500
Tammy?

2143
01:59:33,792 --> 01:59:34,792
Damn!

2144
01:59:44,458 --> 01:59:45,792
Shit Man!

2145
01:59:46,292 --> 01:59:49,250
It took us 6 months to...
- Not 6 months, Rohan...

2146
01:59:49,917 --> 01:59:51,208
8 years!

2147
01:59:52,292 --> 01:59:53,792
8 years!

2148
01:59:54,875 --> 01:59:58,250
I have been fanning this
fire in my heart since 8 years!

2149
01:59:58,458 --> 01:59:59,958
I have prayed for this,

2150
02:00:00,292 --> 02:00:01,917
hoped for this, yearned for this day,

2151
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:06,292
When I see Charan Grover destroyed.

2152
02:00:08,542 --> 02:00:10,875
And today after 8 years,
that day had come!

2153
02:00:12,958 --> 02:00:14,542
The perfect day.

2154
02:00:15,042 --> 02:00:16,292
The perfect plan.

2155
02:00:16,333 --> 02:00:19,750
The perfect revenge!
The perfect everything!

2156
02:00:20,833 --> 02:00:22,792
We have reached here..

2157
02:00:23,833 --> 02:00:28,333
..And according to the plan we will
be leaving in the next 10 minutes..

2158
02:00:33,583 --> 02:00:35,125
But empty handed.

2159
02:00:37,708 --> 02:00:39,000
Mohini!

2160
02:00:39,458 --> 02:00:40,625
Guys!

2161
02:00:51,417 --> 02:00:53,083
They are calling us for the results.

2162
02:00:54,375 --> 02:00:55,333
Yaa...

2163
02:01:08,833 --> 02:01:11,708
Ladies & Gentlemen, it's time!

2164
02:01:12,042 --> 02:01:15,292
The results of the semi finals are
in my hands.

2165
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:19,000
Out of the 16 teams
that performed,

2166
02:01:19,083 --> 02:01:20,458
only 8 winning Teams...

2167
02:01:20,625 --> 02:01:23,750
...will go through to the
finals to be held on new years eve.

2168
02:01:24,208 --> 02:01:29,167
The losers unfortunately will spend
their Christmas on a flight back home.

2169
02:01:30,958 --> 02:01:33,958
And the 8 lucky teams are..

2170
02:01:34,542 --> 02:01:36,083
Spain!

2171
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:39,542
Congratulations, Team Spain!

2172
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:41,500
Our next finalist is-

2173
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:42,750

The next finalist-

2175
02:01:45,083 --> 02:01:46,292
UAE!

2176
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:50,792
We next have Team...

2177
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,292
...Hungary!

2178
02:01:53,583 --> 02:01:57,125
And the next finalist
is team Great Britain!

2179
02:01:58,417 --> 02:02:00,083
And now we have...

2180
02:02:00,167 --> 02:02:01,417
...Team USA!

2181
02:02:03,292 --> 02:02:05,167
Well done team USA!

2182
02:02:05,375 --> 02:02:10,333
And the last team
to reach the finals is,

2183
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:16,625
Team-

2184
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:18,833
Korea!

2185
02:02:24,875 --> 02:02:27,917
These are our 8 finalists.

2186
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:29,875
Thank you very much
for everything and...

2187
02:02:29,958 --> 02:02:33,292
...we shall now see
you next on new year's eve.

2188
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,458
We judges would like to make an
announcement.

2189
02:02:36,625 --> 02:02:38,250
Ladies and gentlemen...

2190
02:02:38,292 --> 02:02:39,708
...contestants.

2191
02:02:40,167 --> 02:02:42,292
Our judges would
like to say something.

2192
02:02:42,792 --> 02:02:44,000
This is a special
announcement.

2193
02:02:44,083 --> 02:02:45,208
Guys, guys.

2194
02:02:45,292 --> 02:02:46,292
Listen up!

2195
02:02:46,958 --> 02:02:48,167
Thank you.

2196
02:02:57,208 --> 02:02:59,333
Today on this stage...

2197
02:02:59,542 --> 02:03:01,292
...we saw something
that hasn't happened...

2198
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:05,042
...in the 10 year history of the world
dance championship....

2199
02:03:05,333 --> 02:03:07,958
In the 10 years of WDC this
has never happened before.

2200
02:03:08,042 --> 02:03:11,542
A rare display of colossal courage
and sporting spirit.

2201
02:03:11,625 --> 02:03:14,625
A rare display of colossal courage
and sporting spirit,

2202
02:03:14,833 --> 02:03:16,750
We bow our heads in respect.

2203
02:03:16,833 --> 02:03:18,083
We salute them.

2204
02:03:18,208 --> 02:03:21,292
All of us together, salute this Team!

2205
02:03:21,708 --> 02:03:24,417
This team took a huge risk.

2206
02:03:24,833 --> 02:03:26,375
They put their performance second.

2207
02:03:26,458 --> 02:03:28,583
This team was extremely daring...

2208
02:03:28,875 --> 02:03:30,292
...took a risk!

2209
02:03:30,333 --> 02:03:35,000
They gave up on their own
performance to help a rival team.

2210
02:03:35,208 --> 02:03:38,625
For another rival team, they
gave up on their own performance.

2211
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:40,000
This quality must be rewarded.

2212
02:03:40,083 --> 02:03:42,292
This quality must be rewarded.

2213
02:03:42,417 --> 02:03:46,917
Because the spirit of dance is so
much greater than any technique!

2214
02:03:47,458 --> 02:03:51,083
We believe the world would
not want to see this team go home yet.

2215
02:03:51,542 --> 02:03:54,833
So we the judges have decided
they deserve a second chance.

2216
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:58,083
So the judges have decided...

2217
02:03:58,417 --> 02:04:01,292
...that they should
get another chance.

2218
02:04:01,792 --> 02:04:06,875
So hold on to your hearts
for the first time ever...

2219
02:04:07,208 --> 02:04:09,375
...a wild card entry...

2220
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:13,542
...into the finals of
the World Dance Championship...

2221
02:04:14,125 --> 02:04:15,375
Is Team...

2222
02:04:15,583 --> 02:04:17,333
INDIA!

2223
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:10,875
Huh?

2224
02:05:11,167 --> 02:05:12,292
Wake up! Wake up!

2225
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,167
Hey fatso!

2226
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:15,208
See this!

2227
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:21,458
Hey..

2228
02:05:21,708 --> 02:05:25,208
Radhe, Radhe! Hail Lord Krishna!

2229
02:05:25,375 --> 02:05:28,750
Radhe, Radhe! Hail Lord Krishna!

2230
02:05:28,917 --> 02:05:32,375
Radhe, Radhe! Hail Lord Krishna!

2231
02:05:33,125 --> 02:05:35,375
Breaking news,
Team India are in the finals!

2232
02:05:35,458 --> 02:05:36,708
Team India you beauty!

2233
02:05:38,083 --> 02:05:39,542
Wo, Team India has..

2234
02:05:39,708 --> 02:05:41,000
Team India!

2235
02:05:41,125 --> 02:05:42,625
We are proud of Team India..

2236
02:05:42,875 --> 02:05:43,875
Wow.

2237
02:05:44,083 --> 02:05:45,208
Good days are here!

2238
02:05:45,292 --> 02:05:46,417
Hail Lord Krishna.

2239
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:49,875
"Look, I don't mean to be rude."

2240
02:05:50,125 --> 02:05:53,417
"But life is like a good
girl with a bad attitude."

2241
02:05:53,542 --> 02:05:57,042
"Damn I tried so hard,
gave it all I could."

2242
02:05:57,250 --> 02:06:00,958
"Finally,
now she looks at me like she should!"

2243
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:06,083
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2244
02:06:06,292 --> 02:06:07,750
"A little bonkers!"

2245
02:06:07,833 --> 02:06:10,833
"As luck is favoring me"

2246
02:06:11,208 --> 02:06:13,042
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2247
02:06:13,125 --> 02:06:14,833
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2248
02:06:14,958 --> 02:06:17,958
"Ohh yeah...yeah...yeaahhhh"

2249
02:06:18,292 --> 02:06:20,125
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2250
02:06:20,208 --> 02:06:21,792
"A little bonkers!"

2251
02:06:21,958 --> 02:06:24,875
"As luck is favoring me"

2252
02:06:25,417 --> 02:06:27,167
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2253
02:06:27,250 --> 02:06:28,917
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2254
02:06:29,042 --> 02:06:32,167
"Ohh yeah...yeah...yeaahhhh"

2255
02:06:53,583 --> 02:06:57,042
"Radhe, Radhe,
Hail Lord Krishna."

2256
02:06:57,208 --> 02:07:00,583
"Radhe, Radhe,
Hail Lord Krishna."

2257
02:07:00,667 --> 02:07:04,083
"Radhe, Radhe,
Hail Lord Krishna."

2258
02:07:04,167 --> 02:07:07,625
"Radhe, Radhe,
Hail Lord Krishna."

2259
02:07:07,792 --> 02:07:10,292
"She is so simple,"

2260
02:07:11,042 --> 02:07:14,417
"But she knows exactly
what she is looking for"

2261
02:07:14,583 --> 02:07:17,583
"If I could ever have her"

2262
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:21,792
"I know she is exactly
what I'm searching for."

2263
02:07:21,958 --> 02:07:23,750
"She is what I need!"

2264
02:07:23,833 --> 02:07:25,375
"But so hard to read"

2265
02:07:25,458 --> 02:07:27,125
"She's complicated"

2266
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:28,958
"I'm intoxicated"

2267
02:07:29,042 --> 02:07:32,917
"I drained the bottle
not a drop left behind."

2268
02:07:33,792 --> 02:07:36,083
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2269
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,917
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2270
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,500
"A little bonkers!"

2271
02:07:39,583 --> 02:07:42,542
"As luck is favoring me"

2272
02:07:43,125 --> 02:07:44,625
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2273
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:46,375
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2274
02:07:46,458 --> 02:07:49,833
"Ohhh yeah, oh yeah.."

2275
02:07:50,208 --> 02:07:52,292
Mohini Joshi's School of dance..

2276
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:54,333
For small children,

2277
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:57,542
so that when a 6 year old dances,
its out of passion..

2278
02:07:57,917 --> 02:07:59,083
..not compulsion.

2279
02:08:01,583 --> 02:08:05,167
How have you become so popular?
Are you ready for the finals?

2280
02:08:18,458 --> 02:08:20,292
"She is a little sweet."

2281
02:08:20,333 --> 02:08:21,917
"And a little spicy."

2282
02:08:22,042 --> 02:08:25,292
"Just to make her smile,
I'd walk forever and a mile."

2283
02:08:25,375 --> 02:08:28,750
"Damn I tried so hard,
gave it all I could."

2284
02:08:28,833 --> 02:08:32,542
"Finally,
now she looks at me like she should!"

2285
02:08:32,625 --> 02:08:34,292
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2286
02:08:34,375 --> 02:08:36,208
"A little bonkers!"

2287
02:08:36,292 --> 02:08:39,000
"As luck is favoring me."

2288
02:08:39,542 --> 02:08:41,375
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2289
02:08:41,458 --> 02:08:43,125
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2290
02:08:43,208 --> 02:08:46,250
"Ohh yeah, ohh yeah... Ohh yeahhh"

2291
02:08:46,542 --> 02:08:50,042
"Radhe, Radhe, Hail Lord Krishna."

2292
02:08:50,125 --> 02:08:53,667
"Radhe, Radhe, Hail Lord Krishna."

2293
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:56,917
"Radhe, Radhe, Hail Lord Krishna."

2294
02:08:57,208 --> 02:08:58,500
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2295
02:08:58,583 --> 02:09:00,292
"A little bonkers!"

2296
02:09:00,333 --> 02:09:03,417
"As luck is favoring me"

2297
02:09:03,792 --> 02:09:05,542
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2298
02:09:05,625 --> 02:09:07,333
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2299
02:09:07,417 --> 02:09:09,083
"Ohh yeahh...ohh yeahh..."

2300
02:09:09,167 --> 02:09:11,125
Jhakkass Nandu!

2301
02:09:14,917 --> 02:09:17,333
See how that moron is dancing?

2302
02:09:17,417 --> 02:09:20,208
He has everything that
should have been yours...

2303
02:09:42,583 --> 02:09:47,375
"I've got a feeling.."

2304
02:09:50,208 --> 02:09:53,833
"I've got a feeling.."

2305
02:10:04,167 --> 02:10:04,833
Hey!

2306
02:10:05,833 --> 02:10:07,292
All of you are scoundrels!

2307
02:10:07,375 --> 02:10:08,583
Roaming
around the whole day,

2308
02:10:08,708 --> 02:10:11,250
and I can't even go to the loo
without being in disguise.

2309
02:10:11,333 --> 02:10:15,000
Mohini is so much better
than you guys! She set me free!

2310
02:10:16,292 --> 02:10:17,917
Haa, Mohini!

2311
02:10:18,083 --> 02:10:19,708
What a sweet girl!

2312
02:10:19,917 --> 02:10:22,167
Charlie, I was thinking that...

2313
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:24,333
...we should tell her the truth.

2314
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:27,750
Tammy, are you drunk?

2315
02:10:29,875 --> 02:10:30,833
Charlie..

2316
02:10:31,042 --> 02:10:32,583
Me and Tammy have decided,

2317
02:10:32,750 --> 02:10:35,375
why not include Mohini
in our plan too?

2318
02:10:35,542 --> 02:10:40,083
Oh wow, you guys have decided to
tell Mohini our plan.

2319
02:10:40,292 --> 02:10:41,583
Has anyone
thought of the consequence?

2320
02:10:41,708 --> 02:10:43,875
She will go tell the cops everything...

2321
02:10:44,083 --> 02:10:47,250
Of course this is a Mohini Fan Club.

2322
02:10:47,333 --> 02:10:49,708
Hmm pray tell me, how
will you tell her?

2323
02:10:49,875 --> 02:10:51,083
Say it frankly, don't be scared.

2324
02:10:51,417 --> 02:10:54,208
Yes I think I'll go tell her.

2325
02:10:54,583 --> 02:10:56,875
Hi Mohini, I am Charlie the thief!

2326
02:10:56,958 --> 02:10:59,083
The Mastermind! Hmm..

2327
02:11:00,292 --> 02:11:01,792
I have made this plan.

2328
02:11:02,042 --> 02:11:03,958
I mean who'd imagine...

2329
02:11:04,333 --> 02:11:07,333
That 5 losers are here,
not to dance in the competition..

2330
02:11:07,417 --> 02:11:09,458
..but to steal millions
worth of diamonds!

2331
02:11:09,583 --> 02:11:11,875
Mission Happy New Year!

2332
02:11:12,375 --> 02:11:17,333
And if your small, naive heart
breaks because of us...

2333
02:11:17,417 --> 02:11:21,958
...so you know what, we are big fans,
don't tell the police..

2334
02:11:22,042 --> 02:11:24,958
..you know we are very, very sorry!

2335
02:11:26,458 --> 02:11:28,250
We are so.....!

2336
02:11:31,708 --> 02:11:32,917
Shite!

2337
02:11:41,125 --> 02:11:45,833
You don't look around before you
start talking do you?

2338
02:11:48,292 --> 02:11:49,042
Mohini!

2339
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:51,542
You heard what we are doing here..

2340
02:11:51,833 --> 02:11:53,875
...you don't want to know why we
are doing it?

2341
02:11:53,958 --> 02:11:55,625
Please, please give me a chance.

2342
02:11:56,917 --> 02:12:02,708
And then I told Mohini
dad's entire story.

2343
02:12:03,625 --> 02:12:07,000
Tammy, Jag and their friendship,

2344
02:12:07,292 --> 02:12:10,083
And Charan Grover & their enmity.

2345
02:12:11,167 --> 02:12:13,542
I lost everything in one day..

2346
02:12:14,042 --> 02:12:18,125
..and learnt that fate
is a fickle mistress,

2347
02:12:19,292 --> 02:12:21,250
It can change sides anytime!

2348
02:12:22,083 --> 02:12:24,708
And on that day,

2349
02:12:25,167 --> 02:12:27,292
I decided to ruin Charan Grover.

2350
02:12:27,833 --> 02:12:33,333
What will you tell your father once
you too are in Jail?

2351
02:12:35,583 --> 02:12:38,208
You think he'll
be proud of you?

2352
02:12:42,292 --> 02:12:43,542
Dad's not in jail.

2353
02:12:43,792 --> 02:12:45,542
Manohar's not in jail?

2354
02:12:46,125 --> 02:12:47,458
Where is he?

2355
02:12:48,167 --> 02:12:50,292
Dad had appealed
in the Supreme court.

2356
02:12:50,708 --> 02:12:51,833
However,

2357
02:12:52,167 --> 02:12:54,875
Grover had bought over
dad's lawyers..

2358
02:12:55,833 --> 02:12:57,917
..tampered with the evidence..

2359
02:12:59,167 --> 02:13:01,042
..and dad lost the case.

2360
02:13:01,625 --> 02:13:02,917
They say...

2361
02:13:03,292 --> 02:13:06,292
...a man can survive
for 4 weeks without food,

2362
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:08,250
4 days without water..

2363
02:13:08,333 --> 02:13:10,750
..maybe 4 minutes without air..

2364
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,542
But without hope?

2365
02:13:16,750 --> 02:13:19,625
Even 4 seconds is
impossible.

2366
02:13:20,958 --> 02:13:23,417
Dad showed a lot of courage,
Tammy!

2367
02:13:23,792 --> 02:13:25,208
24 hours later..

2368
02:13:25,542 --> 02:13:28,583
..they found his body.

2369
02:13:29,583 --> 02:13:32,875
He found a piece of
blade, and he cut himself Tammy.

2370
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,292
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie....

2371
02:13:44,292 --> 02:13:45,292
Charlie,

2372
02:13:45,583 --> 02:13:48,000
Manohar is dead
and you are telling us today?

2373
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,833
I wanted to tell you but I thought
it will make you weak.

2374
02:13:52,333 --> 02:13:55,042
We still had to destroy Charan Grover.

2375
02:13:55,375 --> 02:13:58,125
And for revenge you need motivation.

2376
02:13:59,375 --> 02:14:00,833
No motivation,

2377
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,708
No crime. Right, Tammy?

2378
02:14:02,833 --> 02:14:04,708
You Idiot my motivation
has doubled now!

2379
02:14:04,792 --> 02:14:05,708
Yes!

2380
02:14:05,875 --> 02:14:07,042
Grover, Grover, Grover..

2381
02:14:07,125 --> 02:14:08,917
No one can save him now!

2382
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:12,208
I'm going to kill him, Charlie!
I want to...

2383
02:14:12,292 --> 02:14:13,375
No.. no.. no.. jag.

2384
02:14:13,458 --> 02:14:15,417
Killing him is not a solution.

2385
02:14:15,833 --> 02:14:19,167
If he dies, he won't know
how much dad had suffered.

2386
02:14:19,792 --> 02:14:22,042
He has to die everyday, here...

2387
02:14:22,583 --> 02:14:23,792
...in Dubai Jail.

2388
02:14:24,875 --> 02:14:26,583
The law here is extremely strict.

2389
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,708
They cut off your hands for the
smallest of robberies..

2390
02:14:30,083 --> 02:14:33,292
..imagine what they will do to Grover...

2391
02:14:33,542 --> 02:14:36,042
...if he is caught for
stealing these diamonds?

2392
02:14:36,333 --> 02:14:38,833
They will cut his limbs..

2393
02:14:39,042 --> 02:14:40,458
..and still keep him alive.

2394
02:14:40,917 --> 02:14:42,792
That will be his punishment, and that..

2395
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:44,500
..that will be justice.

2396
02:14:44,917 --> 02:14:48,042
Super plan, Charlie!
That a super plan.

2397
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:51,625
This isn't just a robbery for me...

2398
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:55,167
...it's like a memorial
service for my father!

2399
02:14:55,292 --> 02:14:57,042
Which I have denied
myself for 8 years.

2400
02:14:57,292 --> 02:15:00,333
If he himself tries to stop me, I...

2401
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:02,292
...I still won't budge!

2402
02:15:02,875 --> 02:15:04,250
I'm going to do this...

2403
02:15:04,458 --> 02:15:07,208
And if you guys don't
want to come along, its okay,

2404
02:15:07,292 --> 02:15:08,542
I will do this alone.

2405
02:15:08,792 --> 02:15:10,583
You idiot!

2406
02:15:11,625 --> 02:15:13,875
We've all been alone
since 8 years!

2407
02:15:13,958 --> 02:15:16,292
You got us together for this...

2408
02:15:17,292 --> 02:15:18,625
And now you're talking
About being alone again!

2409
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:19,417
&^%$*#

2410
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:20,625
Let it go Tammy!

2411
02:15:20,792 --> 02:15:23,417
We will not let you go, Charlie.

2412
02:15:27,083 --> 02:15:28,000
Come, Fatso..

2413
02:15:29,167 --> 02:15:31,542
Why are you standing there?
Come here.

2414
02:15:36,625 --> 02:15:38,958
Will someone tell
me what do I have to do?

2415
02:16:16,167 --> 02:16:17,917
The diamonds are here!

2416
02:16:22,583 --> 02:16:28,333
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
Grand finale of the Videocon-

2417
02:16:28,417 --> 02:16:31,625
World dance championship!

2418
02:16:31,833 --> 02:16:36,500
Tonight, the whole world is going to
celebrate along with us...

2419
02:16:36,792 --> 02:16:38,333
This is going to be one,

2420
02:16:38,417 --> 02:16:41,042
Happy New Year!

2421
02:16:43,042 --> 02:16:45,292
I thought we'll get the same room
for the finals.

2422
02:16:45,333 --> 02:16:46,958
Sorry guys, I messed up.

2423
02:16:47,042 --> 02:16:50,292
How could you? You've messed up
everything now!

2424
02:16:50,833 --> 02:16:51,583
Guys...

2425
02:16:54,792 --> 02:16:56,292
Not mess up...

2426
02:16:56,583 --> 02:16:57,875
Throw up!

2427
02:16:59,417 --> 02:17:00,542
What...?

2428
02:17:01,792 --> 02:17:03,000
Stretches... Stretches...

2429
02:17:04,125 --> 02:17:05,125
Hi everyone.

2430
02:17:05,208 --> 02:17:08,292
Rohan how could you
be so irresponsible?!

2431
02:17:12,708 --> 02:17:13,917
Disgusting!

2432
02:17:19,833 --> 02:17:21,833
There is a strange
man vomiting in our room!

2433
02:17:21,917 --> 02:17:23,042
It's disgusting.

2434
02:17:23,125 --> 02:17:25,042
Oh my God, open the door!

2435
02:17:26,125 --> 02:17:28,833
Would you like to use our room?

2436
02:17:29,042 --> 02:17:30,625
Oh thank you, you are an angel!

2437
02:17:30,833 --> 02:17:32,583
Thank you so much!
- Its ok!

2438
02:17:32,708 --> 02:17:34,167
Thank you so much!

2439
02:17:41,250 --> 02:17:42,958
Mention not!

2440
02:17:50,750 --> 02:17:52,792
Hello, hello, Mohini come in.
Hello, Can you hear me?

2441
02:17:52,875 --> 02:17:55,458
You remember right? You have to get
Vikki till the lift?

2442
02:17:55,542 --> 02:17:58,708
Lift? I will drag him till hell
if I have to!

2443
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:02,833
Vikki!

2444
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:07,000
Please help me Vikki!

2445
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:08,833
I can't find my room.

2446
02:18:09,208 --> 02:18:10,958
I have to change
my clothes,

2447
02:18:11,083 --> 02:18:15,917
I promise I will
change in front of you...

2448
02:18:16,708 --> 02:18:19,250
You'll come, won't you Vikki?

2449
02:18:19,375 --> 02:18:22,208
Ahh... Not Vikki.

2450
02:18:23,125 --> 02:18:24,458
Nandu!

2451
02:18:24,833 --> 02:18:26,333
Jhakkas...

2452
02:18:26,375 --> 02:18:27,833
Nanduuuuuu!

2453
02:18:34,458 --> 02:18:37,250
Mohini! You have to go
in the lift on your right.

2454
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:38,958
Vikki...

2455
02:18:39,917 --> 02:18:41,583
It's so hot here?

2456
02:18:41,708 --> 02:18:44,750
I feel like taking
my clothes off here...

2457
02:18:44,833 --> 02:18:46,667
...and throwing them away!

2458
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:48,917
Rohan, what's going on?

2459
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,917
Charlie, Mohini is going to strip!

2460
02:18:51,083 --> 02:18:53,792
Shut up. Keep the walkie down and
get back to work.

2461
02:18:54,917 --> 02:18:55,958
Mohini won't strip.

2462
02:18:56,083 --> 02:18:57,208
Naah!

2463
02:18:57,333 --> 02:18:58,583
Sure?

2464
02:19:01,292 --> 02:19:02,417
Let's go!

2465
02:19:07,292 --> 02:19:08,667
Penthouse!

2466
02:19:11,167 --> 02:19:12,208
Wow!

2467
02:19:12,417 --> 02:19:15,000
I am having like a
killer Dejavu...

2468
02:19:15,125 --> 02:19:16,083
Huh?

2469
02:19:16,375 --> 02:19:20,000
You know Deja Vu? When you feel
like all this has happened before?

2470
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:23,500
When did it happen? We tried but it
didn't happen!

2471
02:19:23,833 --> 02:19:24,542
Huh?!

2472
02:19:25,417 --> 02:19:26,500
Time to sleep!

2473
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:29,583
Good. He won't remember a thing now.

2474
02:19:29,792 --> 02:19:32,333
Good Jag, take Vikki Grover to his
suite and keep him there...

2475
02:19:32,417 --> 02:19:35,750
And yes, get Nandu changed and
send Mohini to room 9C. Over and out!

2476
02:19:35,833 --> 02:19:37,833
Piece of cake my ass!

2477
02:19:38,708 --> 02:19:39,583
Come.. come.. come Rohan.

2478
02:19:39,667 --> 02:19:41,250
Let's get his butt moving!

2479
02:19:50,792 --> 02:19:51,500
Hey!

2480
02:19:51,583 --> 02:19:52,750
Bombil fry!

2481
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:12,917
Come in, Charlie.

2482
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:13,875
Go for Charlie!

2483
02:20:13,958 --> 02:20:15,208
Nandu's left from there.

2484
02:20:30,458 --> 02:20:32,667
Everything is under control..

2485
02:20:33,292 --> 02:20:35,000
Jag! Jag!

2486
02:20:35,458 --> 02:20:37,292
Save me! I can't do this...

2487
02:20:37,333 --> 02:20:39,292
Grover's commando's will kill me!

2488
02:20:39,333 --> 02:20:40,833

2504
02:21:27,958 --> 02:21:29,000
Hey... Nandu!

2505
02:21:29,208 --> 02:21:30,125
That way!

2506
02:21:30,292 --> 02:21:32,208
Yes.

2507
02:21:32,750 --> 02:21:33,583
All sorted Charlie.

2508
02:21:59,750 --> 02:22:00,708
Go get them!

2509
02:22:19,958 --> 02:22:20,875
Vikki Grover...

2510
02:22:20,958 --> 02:22:22,458
Access Granted.

2511
02:22:41,875 --> 02:22:45,292
This is it, Tammy.
150 feet away...

2512
02:22:45,458 --> 02:22:46,542
...Shalimar.

2513
02:22:48,458 --> 02:22:49,375
Are you ready?

2514
02:22:51,083 --> 02:22:52,333

2515
02:22:52,417 --> 02:22:55,333
No Tammy...
Have you seen titanic?

2516
02:22:55,375 --> 02:22:56,125
Yes!

2517
02:22:56,208 --> 02:22:57,875
There was a dialogue in it...

2518
02:22:57,958 --> 02:22:59,292
I am the king of the world?

2519
02:22:59,417 --> 02:23:00,750
No not that one.

2520
02:23:02,292 --> 02:23:03,333
You jump...

2521
02:23:03,542 --> 02:23:04,333
I jump.

2522
02:23:07,667 --> 02:23:09,083
Charlie...

2523
02:23:09,250 --> 02:23:13,875
Charlie...my back side's on fire!

2524
02:23:14,333 --> 02:23:15,500
Charlie!!

2525
02:23:16,167 --> 02:23:17,208
Tammy I'm here.

2526
02:23:17,292 --> 02:23:18,333
I'm here Tammy!

2527
02:23:19,917 --> 02:23:20,833
Right on top of you.

2528
02:23:20,917 --> 02:23:22,542
Charlie are you ok?

2529
02:23:22,708 --> 02:23:23,708
Ya ya ya...we are fine!

2530
02:23:23,792 --> 02:23:25,000
Rubbish we're fine?!

2531
02:23:25,125 --> 02:23:26,792
My back side's scrapped!
- Ssshhhhh!!

2532
02:23:26,875 --> 02:23:28,583
Okay.. okay.. okay! Nandu is in.

2533
02:23:28,708 --> 02:23:31,708
Video loop is on.
Now Shalimar security will see...

2534
02:23:31,792 --> 02:23:33,792
...only what we show them.

2535
02:23:34,458 --> 02:23:35,875
Which is nothing!

2536
02:23:39,167 --> 02:23:39,833
1...

2537
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:40,708
2...

2538
02:23:43,250 --> 02:23:44,417
Looks like Nandu's reached.

2539
02:24:16,542 --> 02:24:18,000
Oh my God!

2540
02:24:18,208 --> 02:24:19,500
Unbelievable.

2541
02:24:19,583 --> 02:24:20,458
What?

2542
02:24:20,792 --> 02:24:21,875
All okay?

2543
02:24:22,125 --> 02:24:24,667
Nandu Bhide.. is the man.

2544
02:24:27,833 --> 02:24:28,667
See this...

2545
02:24:30,458 --> 02:24:33,167
Nandu Bhide.. is the man.

2546
02:24:37,333 --> 02:24:38,792
Charlie he is...

2547
02:24:38,917 --> 02:24:39,917
He is what?

2548
02:24:40,125 --> 02:24:42,333
What.. what? Will someone tell us
what's happening.

2549
02:24:42,417 --> 02:24:44,708
Shhh...Rohan tell me
what Nandu is doing?

2550
02:24:44,792 --> 02:24:45,583
We're losing time here.

2551
02:24:45,667 --> 02:24:47,417
Nandu is opening...it...

2552
02:24:53,417 --> 02:24:54,583
Ohhh Goddess!!

2553
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:02,750
Let's go, Tammy. Lights off!

2554
02:25:02,875 --> 02:25:03,792
Yeah!

2555
02:25:14,333 --> 02:25:15,917
Why are you naked?

2556
02:25:18,583 --> 02:25:19,500
Tammy!

2557
02:25:20,833 --> 02:25:24,375
Nandu, wear your shorts,
shut the panel, and leave,

2558
02:25:25,625 --> 02:25:28,292
Rohan...
disable the lasershield!

2559
02:25:28,667 --> 02:25:29,833
Let's go!

2560
02:25:29,917 --> 02:25:30,875
Why is he naked?

2561
02:25:30,958 --> 02:25:32,583
It's his personal choice...

2562
02:25:46,667 --> 02:25:49,500
Tehmy...Jag get ready for time-sync.

2563
02:25:50,125 --> 02:25:51,542
Hairspray, Tammy?

2564
02:25:54,958 --> 02:25:56,750
Rohan! Lasershield's are still up!

2565
02:25:56,833 --> 02:25:58,250
Just a minute, Charlie Just a minute!
Just a minute.

2566
02:25:58,333 --> 02:25:59,875
We don't have a minute! Do it now!!

2567
02:26:02,208 --> 02:26:04,375
3, 2, 1!

2568
02:26:10,917 --> 02:26:12,167
5 minutes guys!

2569
02:26:12,250 --> 02:26:13,500
5 mins, Tammy!

2570
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:14,958
Starts now.

2571
02:26:15,083 --> 02:26:17,667
Jag, switch the water
pipes with the oxygen pipes.

2572
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:04,750
Tammy! Tammy!
- It's me.

2573
02:27:06,125 --> 02:27:06,917
Tammy!

2574
02:27:07,167 --> 02:27:09,167
Damn this faatsoo!!

2575
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:11,833
Tammy...Tammy!

2576
02:27:12,833 --> 02:27:13,792
Oh God!

2577
02:27:13,875 --> 02:27:15,375
Hold him down, Charlie.
He'll be alright.

2578
02:27:15,542 --> 02:27:16,833
I know he'll be alright.

2579
02:27:16,958 --> 02:27:18,333
C'mon Tammy!

2580
02:27:19,208 --> 02:27:21,792
Oh God! Not now! Not now!

2581
02:27:22,333 --> 02:27:23,083
Tammy!

2582
02:27:23,833 --> 02:27:25,333
How much time Charlie?

2583
02:27:25,833 --> 02:27:26,833
3 minutes left, Tammy.

2584
02:27:26,917 --> 02:27:27,875
Sorry.

2585
02:27:27,958 --> 02:27:28,875
C'mon Charlie...

2586
02:27:28,958 --> 02:27:30,458
I got a safe to crack!

2587
02:28:10,333 --> 02:28:11,583
I did it! I did it!

2588
02:28:11,667 --> 02:28:13,375
Well done, Tammy!!

2589
02:28:13,875 --> 02:28:14,583
Yes!

2590
02:28:14,792 --> 02:28:15,583
Yes!

2591
02:28:16,875 --> 02:28:17,833
And we have 2 minutes left.

2592
02:28:17,917 --> 02:28:19,542
I am a genius. I am a genius.

2593
02:28:19,625 --> 02:28:20,833
Tammy, will you marry me?

2594
02:28:20,917 --> 02:28:21,833
Anytime.

2595
02:28:40,208 --> 02:28:41,333
Let's go.

2596
02:28:46,708 --> 02:28:48,125
What's this, Charlie?

2597
02:28:48,292 --> 02:28:49,375
What now?

2598
02:28:50,625 --> 02:28:52,125
There's another safe here...

2599
02:28:52,208 --> 02:28:53,333
A Glass one.

2600
02:28:53,708 --> 02:28:55,958
Most probably re-enforced
glass or rayon thermoplastic.

2601
02:28:56,042 --> 02:28:57,958
Alpha coded.

2602
02:28:58,333 --> 02:28:59,917
7 digits password...

2603
02:29:00,167 --> 02:29:01,792
Why you wasting time, Charlie!

2604
02:29:01,875 --> 02:29:03,708
If it's a glass safe,
Break it and take the diamonds!

2605
02:29:03,792 --> 02:29:05,083
Shut up, Nandu!

2606
02:29:05,333 --> 02:29:07,250
This opens with a 7 letter password...

2607
02:29:07,333 --> 02:29:08,708
If we put in the wrong password,
the alarm will go off.

2608
02:29:08,792 --> 02:29:09,833
Dammit... dammit... dammit.

2609
02:29:09,917 --> 02:29:10,833
Dammit!

2610
02:29:11,333 --> 02:29:13,542
I underestimated Grover.

2611
02:29:14,333 --> 02:29:16,333
I don't know anything about this safe.

2612
02:29:16,792 --> 02:29:18,458
But I do.

2613
02:29:18,667 --> 02:29:20,667
Charlie this is Manohar's safe too.

2614
02:29:20,750 --> 02:29:21,625
Dad's?

2615
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:23,458
It has Manohar's mark on it.

2616
02:29:23,667 --> 02:29:25,000
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!

2617
02:29:25,292 --> 02:29:26,583
Manohar's bulletproof Glass safe?

2618
02:29:26,667 --> 02:29:27,542
Yes, yes that one!

2619
02:29:27,625 --> 02:29:29,333
Jag, Jag,
Jag, any password or mastercode?

2620
02:29:29,458 --> 02:29:30,625
Tell me Quick.. quick.. quick.

2621
02:29:30,708 --> 02:29:31,833
Password?

2622
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:34,958
Manohar never told us the password.

2623
02:29:35,167 --> 02:29:38,125
Whenever we asked him about it,
He would say...

2624
02:29:38,208 --> 02:29:40,125
Only Charlie can open this!

2625
02:29:41,958 --> 02:29:43,833
He told you anything?

2626
02:29:43,958 --> 02:29:45,708
I am seeing this
safe for the 1st time.

2627
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,083
Okay...

2628
02:29:47,875 --> 02:29:49,667
Charlie you need to move out right now.

2629
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:51,375
You've got one minute
Charlie then the safe will shut!

2630
02:29:51,458 --> 02:29:52,833
I don't know,
I've never seen this before.

2631
02:29:53,333 --> 02:29:54,417
Charlie...Charlie...Charlie!!

2632
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:55,875
Charlie please get out of there...

2633
02:29:55,958 --> 02:29:57,708
Come on Charlie...Charlie!!

2634
02:29:57,792 --> 02:29:59,208
Only Charlie can open it...

2635
02:29:59,292 --> 02:30:00,292
C'mon!

2636
02:30:00,333 --> 02:30:02,083
Charlie let's go please.

2637
02:30:02,167 --> 02:30:04,083
Come on, Charlie, think, Charlie!

2638
02:30:04,167 --> 02:30:05,833
Hurry up!

2639
02:30:06,083 --> 02:30:07,375
Quiet guys...quiet...quiet.. quiet!

2640
02:30:07,458 --> 02:30:08,875
One sec I know...I know!

2641
02:30:09,250 --> 02:30:11,667
Let it go, Charlie, forget it, Charlie.

2642
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:14,083
Dad...dad...dad...
help me here...

2643
02:30:14,375 --> 02:30:15,625
7 digit code...

2644
02:30:15,792 --> 02:30:17,667
Only Charlie can open it...
What does it mean?

2645
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:18,792
Come on, Charlie

2646
02:30:18,875 --> 02:30:20,333
Sshhh!!!

2647
02:30:25,125 --> 02:30:28,583
Only Charlie can open this safe.

2648
02:30:29,042 --> 02:30:31,375
Yeah.

2649
02:30:37,333 --> 02:30:39,667
Only Charlie can open it.

2650
02:30:40,167 --> 02:30:41,375
Guys I'm going for it.

2651
02:30:47,333 --> 02:30:48,250
C...

2652
02:30:51,958 --> 02:30:53,208
H...

2653
02:30:54,750 --> 02:30:55,542
A...

2654
02:30:57,542 --> 02:30:58,583
R...

2655
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,708
L...

2656
02:31:03,125 --> 02:31:04,625
I.

2657
02:31:06,167 --> 02:31:08,083
Only Charlie can open it...

2658
02:31:10,083 --> 02:31:11,333
E!

2659
02:31:31,083 --> 02:31:32,542
Charlie!

2660
02:31:33,583 --> 02:31:35,458
Dad always said...

2661
02:31:37,333 --> 02:31:39,417
...keep it simple!

2662
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,708
We did it Tammy.

2663
02:32:00,083 --> 02:32:01,375
Grover!

2664
02:32:02,208 --> 02:32:04,417
You are finished!

2665
02:32:10,917 --> 02:32:13,250
Rohan, Vikki Grover's woken up!

2666
02:32:13,333 --> 02:32:13,958
Dammn...

2667
02:32:14,083 --> 02:32:15,125
How did he wake up?

2668
02:32:15,208 --> 02:32:16,917

2669
02:32:17,083 --> 02:32:18,583
Everybody initiate... PLAN B.

02:32:19,917 --> 02:32:20,917
Let's go, guys!

2672
02:32:22,542 --> 02:32:25,417
Listen I'm off to the Jetty,
explain Plan B to her.

2673
02:32:25,833 --> 02:32:27,208
Nandu?
- Mohini!

2674
02:32:27,292 --> 02:32:28,375
Rohan?

2675
02:32:28,583 --> 02:32:30,167
We lied to you.

2676
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:31,000
I know Rohan...

2677
02:32:31,125 --> 02:32:32,417
We lied again yesterday...

2678
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:34,750
What we told you was just plan A.

2679
02:32:35,417 --> 02:32:36,917
Whenever I initiate plan B,

2680
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:41,417
Everyone will come here
to this jetty immediately.

2681
02:32:42,458 --> 02:32:45,875
In 15 minutes, we will
leave in this yellow flag boat...

2682
02:32:46,083 --> 02:32:48,250
...and we will be in
international waters soon...

2683
02:32:48,458 --> 02:32:51,625
Away from their police and
the law. Safe and sound.

2684
02:32:51,708 --> 02:32:54,625
But Charlie, won't the cops get
Suspicious if we disappear?

2685
02:32:55,708 --> 02:32:58,208
They will suspect Vikki Grover.

2686
02:32:59,208 --> 02:33:01,583
They will find his
fingerprints at Shalimar,

2687
02:33:01,792 --> 02:33:05,167
and the commando's will re-confirm
that Vikki Grover had come.

2688
02:33:05,542 --> 02:33:06,458
Right!

2689
02:33:07,125 --> 02:33:08,792
Yeah sure.

2690
02:33:09,083 --> 02:33:10,417
Oh, yeah.

2691
02:33:13,167 --> 02:33:14,000
Excuse me.

2692
02:33:15,083 --> 02:33:16,875
Charlie hurry hurry fast fast!

2693
02:33:17,292 --> 02:33:19,417
Yeah, come on.

2694
02:33:19,625 --> 02:33:21,833
Charlie, the door is shutting,
Charlie, the door is shutting,

2695
02:33:21,917 --> 02:33:23,000
Charlie, how will we go out?

2696
02:33:23,125 --> 02:33:25,625
Breathe...breathe!!
- Charlie, how will we go out?

2697
02:33:25,792 --> 02:33:26,417
Breathe... breathe!!

2698
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:28,875
Damn you tell me
how are we getting out?

2699
02:33:28,958 --> 02:33:29,958
Shhh...shhh!

2700
02:33:32,125 --> 02:33:33,250
Yeah?

2701
02:33:33,792 --> 02:33:34,750
See...

2702
02:33:44,583 --> 02:33:46,333
We are flying out?

2703
02:33:46,458 --> 02:33:47,333
Nope.

2704
02:33:47,917 --> 02:33:49,333
Swim out!

2705
02:33:49,833 --> 02:33:50,625
Jag...

2706
02:33:50,958 --> 02:33:51,708
...do it!

2707
02:33:51,792 --> 02:33:52,917
Yes, Charlie.

2708
02:34:10,750 --> 02:34:12,417
Charlie, water.. Charlie, water!

2709
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:14,083
Water...
water...

2710
02:34:14,167 --> 02:34:16,583
You didn't tell me about
the damn water!

2711
02:34:16,958 --> 02:34:19,333
Jag ya... Good rate, the water is
coming in at a good rate. Very good.

2712
02:34:19,542 --> 02:34:20,917
Keep the oxygen pipes ready..

2713
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:22,333
We are good to go.

2714
02:34:22,417 --> 02:34:23,167
What are you doing?

2715
02:34:23,250 --> 02:34:26,792
I have to make do with what I have,
It's a floatation device!

2716
02:34:31,875 --> 02:34:33,667
What's going on? It all looks fine.

2717
02:34:36,792 --> 02:34:38,125
What the hell!

2718
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:39,875
It's a loop!

2719
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:42,333
It's a video loop.

2720
02:34:43,167 --> 02:34:44,833
The water's rising, Charlie!

2721
02:34:44,917 --> 02:34:46,250
Tammy don't worry.

2722
02:34:46,333 --> 02:34:48,250
It's rising... It's rising!

2723
02:34:56,167 --> 02:34:57,333
Mr. Kapoor...

2724
02:34:57,375 --> 02:34:58,875
Shalimar right now!

2725
02:34:59,458 --> 02:35:01,792
We are going to drown, Charlie!

2726
02:35:14,583 --> 02:35:15,500
Okay Tammy...

2727
02:35:16,167 --> 02:35:17,167
Hold your breath...

2728
02:35:17,250 --> 02:35:18,125
Now!

2729
02:35:36,542 --> 02:35:38,208
Jag change the pipe.

2730
02:35:38,542 --> 02:35:40,333
Let's go guys... C'mon fast!

2731
02:35:41,083 --> 02:35:42,333
Tammy okay?

2732
02:35:42,958 --> 02:35:44,792
Sir I've checked all the systems
Everything seems..

2733
02:35:44,875 --> 02:35:45,917
Something's wrong!

2734
02:35:46,250 --> 02:35:47,667
Charlie, got it?

2735
02:35:53,417 --> 02:35:55,208
Okay guys we are done here!

2736
02:35:57,833 --> 02:36:00,125
There is a breach of security...
How is it possible?

2737
02:36:17,417 --> 02:36:19,250
Vikky Grover...
Access Granted.

2738
02:36:47,542 --> 02:36:48,625
Grover?

2739
02:36:49,208 --> 02:36:50,708
Where are our diamonds?

2740
02:36:51,167 --> 02:36:52,750
It's impossible.

2741
02:36:53,750 --> 02:36:55,708
I think it's...it's a setup man!

2742
02:36:55,792 --> 02:36:57,708
And a very clever one at that!

2743
02:36:57,792 --> 02:37:00,125
Only you and your
son can enter this place.

2744
02:37:00,208 --> 02:37:01,917
You told us so yourself!

2745
02:37:13,417 --> 02:37:14,917
What's behind this?

2746
02:37:15,375 --> 02:37:16,417
What's behind this?

2747
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:18,375
Sir, some old A/C ducts..

2748
02:37:18,542 --> 02:37:20,375
..but these are shut since years!

2749
02:37:20,458 --> 02:37:21,792
Open it.

2750
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:23,792
Open it!

2751
02:37:26,375 --> 02:37:28,208
Where does this duct go?

2752
02:37:29,083 --> 02:37:30,583
Where does this duct go?

2753
02:37:31,167 --> 02:37:33,125
I was really scared, Charlie!

2754
02:37:33,292 --> 02:37:34,875
I thought you guys
won't turn up at all!

2755
02:37:34,958 --> 02:37:36,750
I was going to leave alone!

2756
02:37:37,042 --> 02:37:38,542
Hey Rohan's here.

2757
02:37:42,167 --> 02:37:43,583
Rohan, why have you come alone?

2758
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Where's Mohini?

2759
02:37:45,792 --> 02:37:46,667
Where is Mohini?

2760
02:38:12,708 --> 02:38:17,500
My mom used to say, the most
important thing in life, is respect.

2761
02:38:19,917 --> 02:38:22,167
Mohini! Let's leave
before it gets too late!

2762
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:23,500
You go Rohan, I am not coming.

2763
02:38:23,667 --> 02:38:25,667
Mohini, Are you freaking nuts!

2764
02:38:26,125 --> 02:38:27,667
Mohini, please don't do this.

2765
02:38:27,750 --> 02:38:30,417
You'll get caught if you back out now.

2766
02:38:30,542 --> 02:38:32,500
Mohini, it's too late...

2767
02:38:33,458 --> 02:38:35,125
It is too late, Rohan!

2768
02:38:36,208 --> 02:38:38,708
The whole world is
rooting for India today..

2769
02:38:39,333 --> 02:38:41,292
..and India has put their faith in us.

2770
02:38:42,042 --> 02:38:46,375
India will lose its face
& respect If we don't dance today.

2771
02:38:47,708 --> 02:38:51,708
And If you lose you lose,
but don't lose respect!

2772
02:38:53,792 --> 02:38:55,250
You go, Rohan.
- Mohini?!

2773
02:38:55,333 --> 02:38:56,500
Go!

2774
02:39:04,375 --> 02:39:06,000
Great! One less Share.

2775
02:39:06,250 --> 02:39:07,500
Let's leave..

2776
02:39:08,208 --> 02:39:09,167
Let's go.

2777
02:39:09,708 --> 02:39:10,917
Not one..

2778
02:39:11,917 --> 02:39:12,875
Two.

2779
02:39:14,542 --> 02:39:17,792
Charlie, I just came here
to tell you guys that...

2780
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,458
...both me and Mohini
 won't be coming.

2781
02:39:22,750 --> 02:39:24,542
All the best to you, guys.

2782
02:39:24,750 --> 02:39:26,042
I am sorry.

2783
02:39:30,792 --> 02:39:32,958
Not two...

2784
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,375
...three.

2785
02:39:35,833 --> 02:39:37,500
Wait Rohan. I'm coming too.

2786
02:39:37,833 --> 02:39:38,917
Hey..

2787
02:39:39,167 --> 02:39:40,708
...have you lost it?

2788
02:39:40,792 --> 02:39:43,417
You keep changing
the plan all the time!

2789
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:44,500
Have you gone mad?

2790
02:39:44,583 --> 02:39:45,958
You are Mad!

2791
02:39:46,333 --> 02:39:49,042
You will never improve
you drunken wastrel!

2792
02:39:49,167 --> 02:39:49,958
Shut up!

2793
02:39:50,208 --> 02:39:51,375
He's all yours.

2794
02:39:51,458 --> 02:39:54,250
Hey why you getting
irritated at him. Relax.

2795
02:39:54,333 --> 02:39:55,333
Relax?

2796
02:39:55,417 --> 02:39:57,208
Charlie, relax?

2797
02:39:58,167 --> 02:40:00,333
What sort of
people are you?

2798
02:40:00,708 --> 02:40:07,167
That poor girl is risking her life to fight
for our respect, for India's respect..

2799
02:40:07,333 --> 02:40:08,667
And we will just leave
her and go?

2800
02:40:08,750 --> 02:40:10,042
You have lost the plot.

2801
02:40:10,167 --> 02:40:12,000
If we go back then
everyone gets arrested!

2802
02:40:12,125 --> 02:40:13,417
Stick to the plan!

2803
02:40:13,500 --> 02:40:16,333
Take your bloody plan,
make a trumpet out of it...

2804
02:40:16,417 --> 02:40:17,417
...and shove it up your...

2805
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:18,833
...muscular bum!

2806
02:40:18,917 --> 02:40:20,417
Tammy!
- Hey don't touch me.

2807
02:40:20,500 --> 02:40:22,500
Tammy
- It's my decision.

2808
02:40:22,583 --> 02:40:23,708
What are you doing!

2809
02:40:23,792 --> 02:40:24,375
Hey!

2810
02:40:24,458 --> 02:40:25,500
My decision!

2811
02:40:26,917 --> 02:40:28,750
This is wrong, we are a team guys.

2812
02:40:28,833 --> 02:40:31,125
This is wrong!

2813
02:40:31,333 --> 02:40:34,500
We have got one chance to do
something right in our lives!

2814
02:40:34,583 --> 02:40:35,583
No, Tammy!

2815
02:40:35,667 --> 02:40:37,167
What are you two doing?!

2816
02:40:37,417 --> 02:40:38,792
Stop.

2817
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,708
You are sick.

2818
02:40:47,167 --> 02:40:48,250
Okay, get in here.

2819
02:40:48,333 --> 02:40:49,542
This room belongs to which team?

2820
02:40:50,333 --> 02:40:51,458
Which team?

2821
02:40:51,667 --> 02:40:52,958
Sir last minute,

2822
02:40:53,042 --> 02:40:54,375
Team India!

2823
02:40:54,458 --> 02:40:55,375
This is the one. This is the one.

2824
02:40:55,458 --> 02:40:56,917
Move this, move this.

2825
02:40:57,125 --> 02:40:58,958
Marco... open this panel.

2826
02:41:07,292 --> 02:41:09,375
Rohan put this up properly.

2827
02:41:09,458 --> 02:41:11,125
Make sure that you
seal the panel completely.

2828
02:41:11,208 --> 02:41:12,333
Are you sure?

2829
02:41:12,417 --> 02:41:13,208
Yes, Rohan.

2830
02:41:13,333 --> 02:41:15,792
We will never come back this way.
Never.

2831
02:41:30,333 --> 02:41:31,250
Where is the show director?

2832
02:41:31,333 --> 02:41:35,333
Sir, I need you to find
Team India wherever they are!

2833
02:41:35,625 --> 02:41:40,375
Just 1 last act left in the grandest dance
competition the world has ever seen!

2834
02:41:40,583 --> 02:41:44,500
The last act by a team that came
here with zero expectations.

2835
02:41:44,583 --> 02:41:45,500
Guys!

2836
02:41:45,792 --> 02:41:47,417
Team India is missing!

2837
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:48,792
Worldwide..

2838
02:41:48,958 --> 02:41:50,333
I just knew it.

2839
02:41:51,167 --> 02:41:52,542
I tell you, in 10 minutes
they will reach the airport...

2840
02:41:52,625 --> 02:41:53,875
...with your diamonds.

2841
02:41:54,042 --> 02:41:55,917
This team is.....

2842
02:41:56,042 --> 02:41:57,667
India!

2843
02:41:58,208 --> 02:42:01,042
That's right, my favorite team-

2844
02:42:01,250 --> 02:42:02,292
TEAM

2845
02:42:02,333 --> 02:42:04,542
INDIA!!

2846
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:43,583
"I've got a feeling.."

2847
02:42:53,375 --> 02:42:54,833
Come on, Mohini!

2848
02:42:55,500 --> 02:42:57,583
"I've got a feeling.."

2849
02:42:57,875 --> 02:43:04,042
"A feeling in my heart."

2850
02:43:04,292 --> 02:43:05,333
"That you are.."

With plenty of disruptions,

2893

With news full of...

2894
02:45:52,333 --> 02:45:55,167
...scams and corruption!

2895
02:45:56,042 --> 02:45:58,458
Where the common man suffers...

2896
02:45:58,750 --> 02:46:01,583
...from poverty and hunger.

2897
02:46:02,458 --> 02:46:04,208
Yet no matter what,

2898
02:46:04,292 --> 02:46:06,167
Ours is not to question why,

2899
02:46:06,542 --> 02:46:10,125

How the hell is it possible?!

2909
02:47:13,125 --> 02:47:18,125
"We don't want anything
from the world."

2910
02:47:18,542 --> 02:47:21,750
"Just a place in everyone's hearts"

2911

...and Losers.

2941
02:49:39,625 --> 02:49:40,917
Our lives today,

2942
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,167
gave us losers
 this Saccharine moment,

2943
02:49:43,375 --> 02:49:45,792

hearts of the world...

2944

...and emerged victorious!

2945
02:50:19,042 --> 02:50:21,000
And fate...

2946
02:50:21,458 --> 02:50:23,708
...fate is a beautiful thing,

2947
02:50:25,583 --> 02:50:30,500
and if you back your dreams with an
iron resolve, it will change sides for you.

2948
02:50:53,333 --> 02:50:56,042
You had put money on
us losing hadn't you, Grover?

2949
02:50:56,375 --> 02:50:58,417
So how much money did you lose?

2951
02:51:00,417 --> 02:51:01,625
5 million?

2952
02:51:01,917 --> 02:51:03,042
10 million?

2953
02:51:04,667 --> 02:51:05,500

I am Manohar's Son.

2957
02:51:19,667 --> 02:51:21,125

Who Manohar?

2960
02:51:24,958 --> 02:51:26,583
It's a really long story.

2961
02:51:27,917 --> 02:51:30,458
Both of you will have
lots of time in jail..

2962
02:51:30,833 --> 02:51:33,125
Ask your father..

2963
02:51:33,917 --> 02:51:35,958

Diamonds gone...

2970
02:53:02,292 --> 02:53:03,417
We worked so hard...

2971
02:53:03,500 --> 02:53:04,417
For nothing!

2972
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:05,958
So what?

2973
02:53:06,333 --> 02:53:08,667
We got a cheque of $ 1 million...

2974
02:53:08,750 --> 02:53:10,083
...its not enough?

2975
02:53:10,167 --> 02:53:14,208
The diamonds were worth
50 million in the grey market!

2976
02:53:14,375 --> 02:53:15,708
What will we do with 1 million?

2977

We will make a huge safe..

2978
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:20,625
Which even we can't crack into!

2979
02:53:21,333 --> 02:53:24,333
After all,
these 50 million dollar diamonds...

2980
02:53:25,167 --> 02:53:27,833
...can't be in this trophy forever,
can they?
