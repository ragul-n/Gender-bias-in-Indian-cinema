1
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,650
Hey, see you afternoon

2
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,610
Ok

3
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,030
Wait for my return

4
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,030
move it... move it..

5
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,900
Is it back on?

6
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,780
Nope

7
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,150
Check now

8
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,860
Not yet..

9
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,030
P K Kuttappan..
Panachel

10
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,490
Grandpa is in quarantine

11
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,740
My goodness..

12
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,900
Popy -Hey

13
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,150
Vaayu

14
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,780
Look

15
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,820
What's up?

16
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,450
It's just a toy gun

17
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,280
I'll smack you ..
Is this a kid's toy, heh?

18
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,490
My friend Shinto gave it to me
I was just..

19
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,950
..Playing

20
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,780
Don't you have anything to study?

21
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,990
Go, study..
Go home, man

22
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,530
It needs to be returned..

23
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,860
Ask him to get it from me

24
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,860
Dad..

25
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,610
Dad..

26
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,450
Yes

27
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,990
I am taking the pick-up truck

28
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,950
For what?

29
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,320
To buy some straw

30
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,650
Need to put some diesel in it

31
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,110
Take Rs.2000 from the vallet

32
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,490
There is Rs 7500 in it..

33
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,610
Oh..

34
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,320
Hey, Gireesh

35
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,570
Son, go get some straw for
Vayuputran

36
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,740
I have some work at the pond

37
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,240
Why are you taking so long?

38
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,320
He hasn't eaten since yesterday..Go

39
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,820
hmm

40
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,070
Fill diesel for Rs. 1500...

41
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,650
Buy two packs of cigerrettes
and keep the change

42
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,400
Ok

43
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,490
What's for breakfast, Bincy?

44
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,950
Upma and banana

45
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,900
Is this some kind of 'convent'?

46
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,490
Rice will be ready
in a couple of minutes

47
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Ah..super

48
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,320
Bincy..

49
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,610
Oh..

50
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,450
Tell that I left early, if Dad asks

51
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,070
Sure

52
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,030
Here is your coffee

53
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,740
Hey.. Hey

54
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,360
Dad

55
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,570
Lie down there

56
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,780
What the heck did you take
money from my account for?

57
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,610
When?

58
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,990
On last 24th

59
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,650
Didn't you steal Rs 8000 from my account online?

60
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,320
Don't have any idea, I swear

61
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,490
I will die, you have become heavier

62
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,490
Shut up

63
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,900
Dad, please don't hit me
Shut up

64
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,450
Huh...

65
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,650
Don't I look after you
and your skinny horse?

66
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,570
Yes..

67
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,400
Don't I?
Yes..

68
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,990
Then eat, shit ..and
never complain

69
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
The horse market is dull..the whole
tourism sector sucks...

70
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,070
Shall pay you back, I swear

71
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,610
You better do, else I'll break your spine
and feed you for the rest of your life

72
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,280
That would be more
cost-effective for me

73
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,780
You second rate loser

74
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,280
Brother

75
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,240
There is too much of mud

76
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,030
The water source seems blocked

77
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,570
hold it tight

78
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,740
Water will be in plenty,
if that stone is blown off

79
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,780
Sudhi, have a look

80
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,400
Hold it together

81
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,740
Might need six crackers

82
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,570
Pull it out, don't bother
about the valve

83
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,150
Hold it from beneath

84
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,700
Pull this out

85
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,650
..now we have learned
about rationals like pie

86
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,320
Here we divide the numbers into
two groups, rationals and irrationals.

87
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,780
So, what are rationals? We might
need them later..let's go over again

88
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,360
2/3 is a rational number
in which..

89
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,240
..Two is an integer

90
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,740
Hey, you call your friend Shinto and ask
how much does that gun cost..

91
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,360
We may buy one

92
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,820
Really?

93
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,740
Yes

94
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,490
There are many types, uncle

95
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,240
What about fully automatic one?

96
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,860
It will be costly

97
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,240
Do we need to buy the
pellets separately?

98
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,860
There is an offer..if we buy now

99
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,610
100 pellets will come
with the gun, free of cost

100
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,150
How much did you pay?

101
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,570
For the gun or pellets?

102
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,530
For the gun

103
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,360
It was Rs.8000 for the gun

104
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
So cheap

105
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,110
You must have bought it online, right?

106
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,280
Yes..

107
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,320
Swindling!I

108
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,610
Dad..

109
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,280
Uncle... please...

110
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,280
Where is Dad?

111
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,150
He has gone to the pond

112
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,900
What happened?
Nothing

113
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,360
Uncle..

114
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,610
It's slipping, bro

115
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,570
Hey Suresh

116
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,950
Pull harder

117
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,610
Step aside, boys

118
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,490
Let's move

119
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,740
Beware of sharp stones

120
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,400
Hold up, you asshole

121
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,450
Lift it, pull..pull

122
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,150
Pull it out..

123
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,110
Give it to me I will take care

124
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,070
Can you pull a bit more?

125
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Please, uncle, please

126
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,280
No, Popy, no..

127
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,900
My integrity is at stake here..

128
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,490
Don't tell Grandpa, Please

129
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,740
Do you have the
'power' to stop me?

130
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,200
Dad

131
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,320
Uncle, don't tell him..

132
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,110
Dad

133
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,860
Careful

134
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,360
What happened, brother?

135
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,700
Start the car.

136
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,490
What happened?

137
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,780
Take the car, you asshole.

138
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,570
Dad, let me take the car key..

139
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,990
How is he?

140
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,110
Critical, It was a severe stroke

141
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,530
There is no hope, they say

142
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,780
But do we have an option, but to hope?

143
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,820
Isn't it?

144
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,950
Yes

145
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,360
They are doing everything that
Medical Science can

146
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,360
Get some hot water, I am too tired..
Need to take a shower

147
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,150
There is heater in Dad's room.

148
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,950
I haven't eaten the whole day

149
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,990
Lucky you!

150
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,320
After all, we humans are
helpless, Bincy

151
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,200
Didn't they get some
fish from the pond?

152
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,780
I put it in the fridge..
Let me heat it

153
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,150
Has Dad written any will or something.
Do you have any idea?

154
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,240
Is this the time to discuss these?

155
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,950
When you asked for fish curry,
I thought...

156
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,320
Hi Roy..

157
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,450
Who is this?

158
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,740
It's me Felix

159
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,530
Oh..mate..

160
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,150
How is your clinic going?

161
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,070
It's good

162
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,490
He is my distant relative

163
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,610
Kuttappan P K

164
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,950
Yes

165
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,110
How is he?

166
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,400
Still bleeding, can do a burrhole

167
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,860
How did it happen?

168
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,860
What to say? He was pulling out a valve from a pond

169
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,490
At this age!

170
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,570
How is he now?

171
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,200
Felix bro has come

172
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,450
He is talking with the Doctors,
they were classmates

173
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,650
Have you had anything?
- No

174
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,280
Haven't you brought something?
- Yes

175
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,900
Yes, shall we move to the canteen or so?

176
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,200
Jomon..

177
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,530
Yes, brother

178
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,780
They say, he'll get better..

179
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,900
But from what I saw

180
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,740
I don't have much hope

181
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,820
Shall we shift him to some where else?

182
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,320
Where to?

183
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,780
It's all the same everywhere

184
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,570
Look brother, can he sign some cheques?

185
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,990
Can't run anything with out..

186
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,240
Look Jaison

187
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,450
Even if he regains consiousness
how can he sign with a paralysed arm?

188
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,860
Can we take thumb impression?

189
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,240
You all could end up in jail, mate

190
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
He will kill me if I fail to send the load

191
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,700
Oh my God

192
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,200
Bincy

193
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,320
The new horse deal is about
to close, a real good one

194
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,200
That's great

195
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,780
Can't celebrate yet..broker is not happy
with the place he is kept

196
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,450
It would have been 'royal' if we
can keep him in our court yard

197
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,610
Dad will break my knee, if I do

198
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,070
However, that's not an issue now

199
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,950
Anyhow, let me call brother Jomon

200
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,900
Joji..

201
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,900
Hey Joji..

202
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,070
It's your house too..why would
you ask for permission?

203
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Just take him to the courtyard
and tie him there

204
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,070
Joji, what's the matter?

205
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,450
Jomon bro, I shall call back, busy now.

206
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,070
Who was it?

207
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,450
Joji

208
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,280
What?

209
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,150
Said he is busy and will call later

210
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,700
Heh.. Such a slothy dude!

211
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,570
Don't come near him..

212
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,530
Oh my...
- Vaayu....

213
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,860
Stay there

214
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,610
Cover picture looks great

215
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,030
The deal was closed
on that looks only

216
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,950
It would have sucked,
had he been kept in these rubber woods

217
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,570
Unlock from above

218
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,280
Sister make way

219
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,570
Com'on, careful

220
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,530
Don't hold the sheet

221
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,900
Lift

222
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,360
Gireesh... slow down

223
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,530
Look for the steps

224
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,490
Where is the room?
It's upstairs

225
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,200
Why don't we lay him downstairs?

226
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,360
No, he would be happier upstairs

227
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,150
Let's take him there..
Be careful

228
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,150
Mind his arm

229
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,070
Careful with the arm

230
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,360
His arm.. Lift
and turn... that's it

231
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,780
Hold him

232
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,650
That's enough..

233
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,530
Kuttappan brother

234
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,110
are you ok?

235
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,320
We are home, everybody is here

236
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,950
Just blink, if you are ok

237
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,610
There you go..

238
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,490
He is crying..

239
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,110
Hey..he is not,
a little flow is just normal

240
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,150
What are you all staring at?
Now you may leave ..

241
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,400
Bincy...

242
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,490
where is the discharge summary?

243
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,240
I will get it now

244
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,780
Bincy...

245
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,240
this one in the morning,
and...

246
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,450
Just a moment..

247
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,610
Joji
Do you have any change?

248
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,450
Don't you have fifty or hundred?

249
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,990
Give it to him

250
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,240
Thanks

251
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,530
Ok then

252
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,200
What is this, man?

253
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,110
Why are you tipping 500 rupees
for a 2000 rupees ride

254
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,570
It's for our Dad, right?

255
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,280
Isn't there any value for money

256
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,150
Jaison..

257
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,150
Yes, brother

258
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,070
He was far better at the hospital..
Here it seems ..

259
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,610
Panachel Kuttappan's gone..
This is not our Dad ..

260
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,780
Then who is it?

261
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,950
I will tell you something

262
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,070
In the coming days we
should make our Dad happy...

263
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,860
We should work tirelessly for it
and pray as well..

264
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,950
Today onwards there will be
evening prayer at this home at 8, I will lead

265
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,860
Close your rubber shop before that..
Are we clear?

266
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,360
Joji, heard it?

267
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,610
Popy

268
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,070
It was mainly for you

269
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,070
Where would I go?

270
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,320
That's it, you should be here

271
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,740
So, whats the plan for now?
I'm thirsty

272
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,320
Don't you have any bottle?

273
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,530
I have an opened bottle of MH

274
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,150
What about you?

275
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,030
I have some Vodka..not much is left in it

276
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,280
Don't you have better ones?

277
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,280
There must be bottles in his cabinet

278
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,240
Here?
Yeah

279
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,110
Bincy..
- Oh

280
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,490
Ah..Whats up?

281
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,360
Any new projects?

282
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,070
Just sold off a horse...

283
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,860
Good

284
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,820
Dad, let me take a bottle

285
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,610
Jomon... good night, then

286
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,280
I've to go to the clinic tomorrow and the
day after..

287
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,030
I shall bring the priest on Sunday

288
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,490
Where is my car?

289
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,030
Brother, don't drive in this condition..

290
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,360
I will drop you...

291
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,360
Hey Jomon, don't under estimate me

292
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,070
I can drop you, if needed..

293
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,900
Heh..hheh..

294
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,240
Joji, please drop our Felix bro home..

295
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,780
Brother..we are home
Ah..

296
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,610
Good..

297
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,490
Brother..

298
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,070
Let me ask frankly..
How long will Dad live?

299
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,400
To be frank...

300
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,490
Won't cross this fortnight

301
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,280
Good night...

302
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,200
..you..millionaire

303
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,950
♪ Halleluja..halleluja. ♪

304
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:22,070
♪ Oh Lord... my soul takes refuge in you
Shower your benovalance ♪

305
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:33,490
♪Offer the shadow of your wings
till the threats are gone ♪

306
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:39,740
♪ Halleluja.. ♪

307
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:47,530
Jesus, our creator, Lord and
saviour...

308
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:05,030
..all these happened when
he lived among us

309
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,070
We also believe; therefore,
we also speak.

310
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,490
Father, Dad is showing restlessness

311
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,200
Friend, it's quite normal

312
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,450
This is a confession before the God..

313
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,530
Of our Father's sins, it's not easy..
Restlessness is normal

314
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,860
But, I can't watch it
like this anymore

315
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,650
What's your name, again?

316
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,110
Jomon

317
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Jomon

318
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:37,570
What you need to do now is, step aside,
close your eyes and pray for your Dad..

319
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,610
Jesus sent out these twelve with
the following instructions

320
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,650
Don't go among the Gentiles

321
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,990
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers

322
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,030
Raise the dead, drive out demons...
- Father

323
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,450
Freely you have got; freely give.

324
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,780
Do not get any gold or silver to take
with you in your belts

325
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:16,280
Bless me, O Lord
Peace be upon you

326
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,610
Father..
- Mr Jomon, don't you understand my words?

327
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:26,900
Wise people should normally get it
Is there no one to make him understand?

328
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,650
Look at Dad..

329
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,490
Come here

330
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,200
Everybody listen

331
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:46,900
This is to atone the sins which might
have been committed by our Father

332
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:54,030
Anointing oil prayer is a sacrament
passed on to us by our holy fathers

333
00:31:54,450 --> 00:32:01,150
Nobody has the right or power to
interrupt it mid-way

334
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:10,240
Even if our Father departs us during this,
consider it as God's will

335
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:17,650
There is no farewell more blessed
and peaceful than this

336
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:26,240
All the children of God gathered here
may close their eyes and pray for him

337
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,110
We are entering the most important part..

338
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,650
Dad will die lying there

339
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,150
Felix -There is nothing to be done, believe me
Fr Kevin -I put my hands on every ..

340
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,030
Fr Kevin -I apply anointing oil and pray...
Felix -It's time for him to go

341
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,700
..pray for his atonement
- You pray... pray

342
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,990
Father, son and holy...
- No, I can't allow this..heh!

343
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,990
Hold him Jaison

344
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,030
Step off

345
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,650
Joji take him

346
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,490
You cannot abruptly stop it..

347
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,110
This tea is not sweet
- From the coffee machine, isn't it?

348
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,150
Shall we re order?
- No

349
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:21,610
Look, this surgery thing is a scam.
They'd even suggest a head transplant

350
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,490
Do we have an option, bro?

351
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,950
I think it's waste of money, 10-15 lakhs

352
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,110
But, it is good for public opinion

353
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,450
That is also important

354
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,200
Don't bother about money now

355
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,030
Did you ask Joji's opinion?

356
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,280
For what?

357
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:48,150
How do you manage the OTP?
It's sent to Dad's number, right?

358
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:54,070
Can do it when Grandpa goes to the
bathroom but we should be alert..

359
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,280
Why?

360
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,450
Just..you know

361
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,570
Yes, uncle

362
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,530
Hey Son...

363
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,650
How is Dad?

364
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,990
He is fighting,

365
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,320
but we can't
predict the result

366
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,900
Don't worry, he will recover soon

367
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,860
I'm sure

368
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,820
Nobody has hope in surgery,

369
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,570
but could we look the other way?

370
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,990
Sure..we should be hopeful,

371
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,530
I just wanted to get a clear picture..

372
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,990
Do I have to book the tickets now?
Or else...

373
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,700
Fare is too high now

374
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,740
Mmm..

375
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,700
Uncle..tickets...
- Just for a clarity

376
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,820
Ok..start searching

377
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,280
Wish he does not suffer

378
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,530
Absolutely, that's just it

379
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,900
Uncle, I've a call from the hospital..

380
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,820
Hold on
shall get you the final picture

381
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:11,860
Hello

382
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,360
Joji, are you at home?

383
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,030
Yes, tell me frankly

384
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,900
The surgery is over,
he is showing good progress

385
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,400
He has regained conciousness

386
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,610
Doctor says everything is fine

387
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,200
Inform Bincy too

388
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,400
Yeah
- ok

389
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,450
Uncle
- any updates

390
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,320
everything looks good

391
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,740
Dad is ok
So, no need of a ticket now

392
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,030
God's grace

393
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,240
Yea, yea

394
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,740
Ok then

395
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,570
Brother

396
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,950
O Lord..

397
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,030
Mind his leg

398
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,570
...careful
Ok

399
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,280
Alright?
- Yes

400
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,150
Slowly

401
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,610
Jaison, please come

402
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,110
Kuttappan sir..

403
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,780
Enough?

404
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,400
Uncle

405
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,780
he is back

406
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,570
Are we in trouble?

407
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,700
I am not, perhaps you are..

408
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,280
Popy, I have some important works,
If you don't mind give me some privacy

409
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,150
Go away..

410
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,240
Uncle...

411
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,280
This is the right time

412
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,860
As he works like a dog

413
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Jaison bro has all the right to ask..

414
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,150
Dad has lost his sight

415
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,860
the whole wiring has gone

416
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,740
this is the best time to ask

417
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,110
Bincy is this some new technology?

418
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,110
Step aside

419
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,200
As per the bank

420
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,360
If you authorise

421
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,240
I can sign the cheque on your behalf

422
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,240
You don't need to suffer...

423
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,570
Kuttappan sir, well done

424
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,860
Doctor said, he should be encouraged

425
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,110
You go downstairs

426
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,950
And...

427
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,030
We are in need of cash

428
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,780
Had to break Bincy's fixed deposit
to handle the crisis

429
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,820
We have seen a flat in the town

430
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,320
It's near the clinic
where we consult

431
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,450
If you have something in mind
for us

432
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,240
That will prove helpful

433
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,530
We have already paid
the advance amount

434
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,740
Jaison, my son..

435
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:13,030
So, my sons made this plan expecting
me to die

436
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,110
But hard luck this time

437
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,610
Do one thing now

438
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,110
This fan is too noisy

439
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,070
Fit an air conditioner in the room

440
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,320
Ok

441
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,450
You may go

442
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,110
What happened?

443
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,950
We won't get a penny when he is alive

444
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,240
See this... his perfect signature,

445
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,070
That too in a few days after the surgery

446
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,400
I've been trying to do this
since my 10th grade

447
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,570
Bincy, do not send me upstairs
with these kind of stupid ideas

448
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,030
It was such a humiliation

449
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,990
Bincy, get me some cold water

450
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,740
Joji, it's in this fridge

451
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,610
You can open
it from where you sit..

452
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,700
Water bottles are here

453
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,990
Take it by yourself, and drink

454
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,070
What happened, Bincy?

455
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,860
Did he talk to Dad?

456
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,570
Our plan will never, ever work, Joji

457
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,990
He is running on drugs

458
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,610
Won't last long
Take it easy

459
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,860
Your good days will be wasted
on this kitchen slab

460
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,150
Dad..

461
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,150
Dad..

462
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,570
Mmm?

463
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,780
Let me say it to your face

464
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,070
All of us have issues

465
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,820
Nobody talks because of the fear,
love and respect towards you

466
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,740
You came back from the death bed..

467
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,780
Didn't you see death up close?

468
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,070
Life is just like that, anybody
could get the call any day

469
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,820
We will look after you, that's what
you want, right?

470
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,280
Trust us

471
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:36,780
Dad..

472
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,950
You always say that I am second piece

473
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,740
You are right ..I am

474
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,860
I could never be the son you desired..

475
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,740
Could'nt even be the one I wanted to be

476
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,650
It's only the matter of one click, Dad

477
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,820
I will prosper

478
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,650
Everybody will prosper

479
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,360
Trust me, please..

480
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,150
Dad, my youth is being fu**ed up

481
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,530
Nobody takes anything with them
in the final journey...

482
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,070
Come on, let's go out in the sun

483
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,820
Kuttappan sir

484
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,240
Keep squeezing this ball

485
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,320
Let me eat something
- Mmm

486
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,400
Who is there?

487
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,150
One of the subjects of your kingdom

488
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,450
Go..go away

489
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,450
It's been a couple of days..right?

490
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,530
Any luck?

491
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,900
I am just..

492
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,780

00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,150
Jomon bro has gone off the track

515
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,950
He wants to burst crackers
when the body is taken for burial

516
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,070
You please come
- Where is he?

517

He is there

518
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,240
It would have been better
if we got bigger ones

519
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,490
Look Jomon, people
will make fun of us

520
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,700
I think this is not enough

521
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,990
What nonsense are you doing?

522
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,360
Bro, Dad had told us not to cry
when he dies, right?

523
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,860
Didn't he ask us to
burst crackers too?

524
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,700

00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,900
He might have told many things while drinking

528
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,950
You don't have to take all of it seriously

529
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,740

A little, for the sake of a meeting

546
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,530
I thought you were much younger..

547
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,240
Couldn't assume your age

548
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,530
Would you have shown more
respect if you knew my age?

549
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:54,860
Father, we are planning to have
Dad's service next Friday

550
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:58,070

many..

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,990
But you should promise me that nothing
untoward, like earlier, would happen again

554
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,200
Do you mean the first incident
or the second one?

555
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:14,320
I am a nobody,
just a worm..

556
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,320
You may ignore me..

557
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:20,530
But like the manual we get with all appliances,

558
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:21,320
Yes, father

559
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,650
Bible is the manual for us Christians

560
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:25,740
We know that, Father

561
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,490
We should obey and respect it

562
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,740
I will come only if you ensure this

563
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,450
Sure...
Sure Father

564
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,900
You're new here and might not have noticed

565
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,820
There is a board under the church's flag pole ..

566
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,530
..Which reads, 'sponsored by
P K Kuttappan Panachel'

567
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,860
If you can keep off from his
service, good luck with it...

568
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,360
Let's go

569
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,780
Give me a minute

570
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,280
Stop pleading and come

571
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,240
Father, don't feel bad, you know..
Most families have that black sheep

572
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,570
Is he drunk?

573
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,990
He is divorced

574
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,490
and has taken refuge in Brandy,
after Dad's death

575
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:07,950
Guessed that much

576
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,740
Don't keep this in mind

577
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,610
Please come for the service

578
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:13,780
You may go

579
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,280
Will he come, the Father?

580
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,650
If he has some dignity, he won't.

581
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,990
Anything more to wash?

582
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:21,780
No, that's it

583
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,240
Do not mix the coloured
and white ones in the machine

584
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,320
Brother Jomon might not need the
Church and chaplains...

585
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,200
But that's not our case... we have to
run the business here

586
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,610
When Dad was around, we had to
fear him only.....

587
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,150
now it's like..

588
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:43,280
Think of some solution rather
than the problems

589
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,950
Joji, It's hard to get along with
drunkards like him

590
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,950
No need...

591
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,490
We can do the partition and live as we want to

592
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:58,990
Ask brother Jaison to talk to him
We can sit together ASAP

593
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,650
I do not think brother Jomon
would come to the table

594
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,400
If he doesn't come our way,
we should go his..

595
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:09,990
Get two bottles..

596
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,150
How about it?

597
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:40,650
Are you coming straight from the clinic?
- Yes

598
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,780
Things should be sorted out,
smoothly, thats all

599
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:48,110
You guys need not talk much
I will deal it

600
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,110
Here he comes, shall I fix the drink?

601
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,360
Why not?

602
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,860
What happened, Jomon?
Are you on some fasting?

603
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,990
Nothing like that,
Let the discussion be over

604
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,610
Else I will be blamed for tanking it..

605
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:08,860
The drink can wait

606
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,360
He has a point..

607
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,700
It's better not to
mix drink with discussion

608
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,070
Joji, keep it there and sit

609
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,900
Jomon

610
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,030
even though it was
not to happen this soon,

611
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,110
..brother Kuttappan had a
plan for the partition

612
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:26,240
He had discussed it with me,

613
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,740
but I am not disclosing it here..

614
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:34,820
If I do, tomorrow, I will be
accused of bias, even by you

615
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,700
Dear brother, I have no plan for this

616
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:41,490
nor have any qualms if we get lesser share

617
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,150
If Dad had any such plans,
you spell it out

618
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,950
That can wait...

619
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,700
if you guys have any
plans we can discuss it here

620
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,570
Jomon... Jaison..

621
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,740
Even Bincy can tell her opinion

622
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,570
Look, I have a plan..

623
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,860
..But it's very basic.
- You stop

624
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,070
Brother Felix won't come with out plan
in his mind

625
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:03,860
let him speak first

626
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,490
Alright...

627
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:08,070
let it be ..

628
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,950
I am ready to
do it for brother Kuttappan

629
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,240
Going by conventions,

630
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,650
the estate will go to Jomon

631
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:23,030
Shop and the property in Mundakkayam
for Jaison

632
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,990
..then, as the youngest son

633
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:28,450
Joji will get
this house and sorrounding compound

634
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,320
If it goes slightly uneven

635
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:34,990
we can make
it right with other small properties around

636
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:37,450
Besides, he has some
bank balance too

637
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:39,320
And then,

638
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,150
the FD in the Canara bank-

639
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,320
he wished to give it to Popy

640
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,030
That's it..I was just saying

641
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,900
Decision is yours

642
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:52,110
The greed we are showing now

643
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,150
Dad's spirit will be watching

644
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,320
No issues, let him watch it

645
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,610
How do you think things are
managed here?

646
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:01,450
I am working like a dog
for years now

647
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,070
Nobody is belittling your effort,

648
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,700
but don't boast about it

649
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,950
I too have done a lot for Dad

650
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,990
If you have toiled, you got rewarded too

651
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:14,490
How much did he spend for your divorce?

652
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,150
Jaison, dear,

653
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,740
I didn't know that you
were keeping an account book

654
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,530
Yes I do,

655
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,530
I have written down everything correctly

656
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,070
that's what
my Dad taught me

657
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,610
I do not have any shame in it

658
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:27,530
Don't raise your voice, sit
- Brother

659
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,610
The family members are getting a chance,
for the first time

660
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,950
let them speak out.

661
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,240
That's we are here for, Let's talk

662
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,990
There is nothing to talk, brother.

663
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:39,110
Even if my son and I don't get anything

664
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,240
no partition is happening right now

665
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:43,490
Let the death anniversery be over

666
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,450
Brother, a word please

667
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,570
You should understand something.

668
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:51,530
I am bearing the
whole expense of this house

669
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,860
I had to break Bincy's FD and even
roll money from somewhere else

670
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:59,200
I had to pay even for
your fire crackers

671
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,200
Now the church goers and neighbors
are blaming me too

672
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,150
That's what I am saying..

673
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,490
People blame us even
for bursting a string of crackers...

674
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,400
What would they say if we partition just
after his death?

675
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,820
They won't hesitate to accuse us of
murdering our Dad for his property..

676
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:15,950
There's nothing unusual in it.

677
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:20,030
When wealthy
men die, people do gossip

678
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,820
There's something exiting for them in it..

679
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,950
We just ignore them

680
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,150
Brother, do you know what

681
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,740
our priest that lil' dwarf

682
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:29,070
He said in the sermon that we were partying
with crackers to celebrate Dad's death

683
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,400
Some other rascals

684
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,280
find fault with us for not
conducting autopsy on Dad

685
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,200
That's a fact...

686
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,780
it has been a talk
for some days now

687
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,110
Look, wasn't he showing signs
of recovery by then?

688
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,110
Let's leave it, Uncle.

689
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:48,320
We should not talk
about it even among us

690
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:48,950
- That's right

691
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,200
This is how it becomes a gossip

692
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,400
No.. Sis,

693
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,360
such a talk is already
out there..I hear it often

694
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,860
I am leaving, you
continue the discussion

695
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,950
Look, Jaison..There is enough and more
money in Dad's account

696
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:03,650
take it, everything will be fine

697
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:06,200
It's complicated..

698
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,240
There are lots of
formalities, will take time

699
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,780
I have Rs 3 lakhs with me

700
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,700
You can use it for the time being

701
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:15,280
Got it from that horse deal..
So it's ours

702
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:16,820
I did lend it from Dad

703
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,990
That will not be enough..

704
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,610
Don't we need to move forward?

705
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:21,280
There is no change in plans,

706
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,240
You are getting
the Mundakkayam property

707
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,200
Let's think of the formalities to run it

708
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,320
The plantation goes to you, brother Jomon

709
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,030
There will be no change in
brother Felix's plan ...

710
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:31,740
We shall wait till the anniversery
to execute this

711
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,700
that's it

712
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,950
Let it go like this..

713
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,360
They can live
here even though the house is mine

714
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,490
What do you think, Jaison?

715
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,700
If everything goes fine, I am ok

716
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,030
There will be no issue

717
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:46,360
I am not sure whether that Priest
would come for the service

718
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,570
You should stop these
drunken banters

719
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,530
What am I doing wrong?

720
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,240
I am reflecting
what the public says

721
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:53,900
Brother

722
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:59,110
My decision has nothing to do with the
public. I don't care what they say

723
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:03,150
But your words, that our Dad is
watching our greed,

724
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,820
That touched me

725
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,900
So, let things go like this
what do you think?

726
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:10,450
Ok? - Why not?

727
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,240
Then flip the glass, pour a drink

728
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,030
Come sit here

729
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,030
Joji, you did well..

730
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:20,610
I never expected
this from you..good

731
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:23,700
All of you showed the qualities of
brother Kuttappan, very good.

732
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,990
We only had 2 acres of land
when our father passed

733
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:28,740
Now my brother and I have
four law suits between us

734
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,240
Dear believers..

735
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:51,450
May the good God bless
all of those who shared the grief...

736
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:58,280
..of this family and prayed for them
for the last forty days

737
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,740
Christians generally have the maturity to
distinguish between practice & malpractice

738
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:13,740
We saw other communities fight to protect
their tradition right even in our junction

739
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,530
I would say,

740
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:21,450
By bursting crackers
and shouting when our Father's dead..

741
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:24,610
..We are demeaning our own heritage,

742
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,650
which is not a noble deed

743
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,110
If someone responsible from the family
could step in and express gartitude..

744
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:37,360
..We can wind up the function
and and have food

745
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:50,650
We are happy that everbody came here
despite it being a bad time

746
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:54,240
I express my gratitude on
behalf of the Panachel family

747
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:59,280
Many rumours about our
Father's death are doing rounds

748
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:02,740
There are many who say that bursting
crackers was against the tradition

749
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,360
Some even say that we were
celebrating by bursting crackers

750
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,200
Let me be clear ..

751
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,240
We are ready take on them

752
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,200
physically and legally

753
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:17,200
Be it the gossip mongers in the toddy shop

754
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:20,110
or the sweet talkers of the clergy house

755
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,070
Jomon's manual is his conscience

756
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,450
Now all of us can have
food and disperse

757
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,570
Thank you

758
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,900
Let's have food then

759
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,450
Hey hey hey...

760
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,200
I shall serve..

761
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,280
I have already served

762
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:00,450
Father needs special serving
Have two more eggs

763
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,700
Have it.... Father

764
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:02,820
Come here..

765
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,860
Have it, Father

766
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:05,490
Come here..

767
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,400
Father is tired after service
Let him eat

768
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,110
Uncle should ask him

769
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:15,650
Come here..

770
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,070
What are you doing?..

771
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,200
There is nobody to serve

772
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,820
You do nothing, keep it there

773
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:22,070
keep it there

774
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,110
Sit there..
Sit

775
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:26,070
Didn't I plead you not to do this?

776
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,400
People should have a
minimum level of sanity

777
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,900
Is it a crime to serve a Priest
with some eggs?

778
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:30,950
Is it?

779
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,150
How much did you drink?

780
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,900
Jomon, this is no joke

781
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:40,360
This laugh will vanish if Father's
body will be dug out from his grave

782
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,950
What has he done?

783
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,740
It was dumb,

784
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,780
Fr.Kevin is very influential

785
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,610
That's true

786
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:48,990
I don't understand
what his problem is?

787
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:51,610
He is the main supporter of all
the gossip mongers.... Shhh

788
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:53,150
Who is that?
- It's me Gireesh

789
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,240
I am coming

790
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:55,070
What?

791
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:56,200
The egg curry is inside

792
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,990
There is a WhatsApp group..

793
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:02,030
Which is the breeding ground of gossipers

794
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,610
When he foul mouths us coming right here,
- The priest didn't eat anything

795
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,650
Isn't it my duty as a son to protest?

796
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:09,030
Tell me..

797
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,860
That Father walked out
with out having food

798
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:11,610
- What?

799
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:12,610
He did not have food

800
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:15,280
That's what I said..
- I am happy..

801
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:17,570
Eldest son! Phew.. You're trying to dig
Dad from the grave

802
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,490
Let them dig him out,

803
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:21,700
and examine

804
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,570
If they find nothing, I will...

805
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,740
This is not any love for Dad,
he only wants to keep drinking

806
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,490
He is nothing but an alcoholic..
Mere alcoholic

807
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:30,360
He is sick, needs treatment..

808
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,860
No wonder that your
wife dumped you... You

809
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:57,280
His condition was exposed
in front of all

810
01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:58,900
that's why

811
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,200
Take it easy

812
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:00,110
Got up early?

813
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:03,990
I dreamt about Dad

814
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:10,530
The dead will never return

815
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,030
But beware of those who are alive

816
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:28,320
Is it caused by lightning?

817
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,860
I will take care of it
Ok..Ok..

818
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,200
Bincy,

819
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,950
Do you know where
Joji was when Dad passed?

820
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,450
Can't recollect anything from that day
It was utter chaos then

821
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:10,110
Only thing I remember is the hardship
to take him downstairs, thanks to you guys

822
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,070
Hey
What is it?

823
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,820
Did you smoke near the pond yesterday?

824
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:26,400
Seems there was some fire..

825
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:29,700
I didn't. I go to smoke by the canal

826
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,900
Mmm..

827
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:35,110
What a small room this is!

828
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,280
Why don't you sleep at Dad's room

829
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:39,150
Oh..Let the anniversery be over

830
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:43,950
I had been slightly off yesterday

831
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,070
Not slightly

832
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,400
You were right,

833
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:48,860
alcohol is the problem

834
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,070
Good for you if you realise that

835
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,860
Don't act dumb like this

836
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,860
Look dear, Dad was recovering, no?
Yet he's gone

837
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,280
I totally lost it

838
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,900
You don't keep it in mind

839
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,070
Look, that 'Thotta' Sudhi was
your classmate, right?

840
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,150
Which one?..

841
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:10,280
Oh him!
I think so..

842
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,110
He stabs from the back..

843
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:17,740
As if it is his Dad, who had died

844
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,280
I'm gonna hold him by his balls
and ask about what he is saying..

845
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,240
Then I will thrash his pulp out..

846
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,450
You are being stupid

847
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:29,780
If you have an issue with some one..
- Listen asshole, its not about me but you

848
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:30,570
What?

849
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:32,400
Where were you when Dad passed?

850
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,490
He claims that when they came running
hearing Bincy's scream

851
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:38,200
you were coming from
the rubber woods 'in slow motion'

852
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,110
Me?

853
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,200
How is it,

854
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,110
can you see it coming around?

855
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:48,360
What kind of people are they?

856
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,900
Unbelievable

857
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:57,110
If they spread these kind of stories
about a blanket boy like you...

858
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,070
..what won't they say about me
who flexes muscles all the time

859
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,030
Society is a f***er, bro

860
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,030
Of course

861
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,200
I will get him, anyway

862
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:19,650
Brother, call me if you get him
- Sure..

863
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,030
Ok..ok

864
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:45,570
He is in the east canal, come..

865
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,610
Sure..

866
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,070
Air gun? ..

867
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:58,490
No need of it, Come

868
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,490
If it's violence, let it be...

869
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,650
Stay there

870
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,490
I got gun powder with me

871
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:45,650
You asshole..
- Joji..Hey

872
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:46,280
What is it?

873
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,860
What the f*** did you say? Was I walking in 'slow motion'
when my Dad died? -Hey Joji...

874
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:51,240
..heh! What did you say?

875
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,530
Weren't you fishing in the pond?

876
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:53,700
What if I did fish, asshole?

877
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,490
Wasn't it drained recently?

878
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:57,320
He was fishing in the fishless pond..
That's what I..

879
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,570
Don't you dare lying about me?

880
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:00,610
You're a
dead man, if you mess up with Panachel family

881
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:01,820
Go away..
- Brother Jomon..

882
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:03,400
How dare you come for our family?

883
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:05,490
Run..You, low life..

884
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:08,280
Brother, don't let this pig
set foot in our compound anymore

885
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:11,360
Jomon brother, he's raking up non issues.

886
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,150
I saw you that day and you know that

887
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,360
Making up stories..you

888
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,530
Your mother's pineapple

889
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:17,360
Get lost, you..

890
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:18,780
Get lost...

891
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,200
Scoundrel..... Classmate....

892
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,360
Come on, brother
Let's go..

893
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:35,700
What's it brother?

894
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,030
Why did you go to that fishless pond?

895
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:41,650
I went there to smoke, and..
The fishing rod was there, I just..

896
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,280
Didn't you tell me that

897
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,900
you used to smoke by the canal?

898
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,150
Is it?

899
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:09,990
Why do you lie?

900
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,280
What's the matter

901
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:16,740
What are you hiding from me?

902
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,030
Brother I can explain
- Tell me....

903
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,320
Leave me brother
Leave me... leave me

904
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:20,820
Spit it out

905
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:21,950
Don't trust the society

906
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:24,150
Leave me..
- What are you hiding?

907
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,740
I will die, brother

908
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:26,740
What are you hiding?

909
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:30,150
I will die...
Brother..I will die

910
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:33,990
This is what happens
if you mess with me

911
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,740
Brother was in pursuit of him
through the canal

912
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,450
When I came after parking scooter

913
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,860
Jomon brother was yelling at him

914
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,610
Then he shrugged and ran..

915
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,030
Suddenly I heard
a thunder-like sound

916
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,240
There was a tremendous force in the air..

917
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:03,950
Dust was all over there

918
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,700
I saw brother's leg

919
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:15,570
I can't usually stand seeing people fighting.
I will start shivering

920
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:20,280
Although I was scared,
I accompanied him to avoid any trouble.

921
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:22,360
He was really violent

922
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,030
Was he drunk?

923
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:31,950
Of late I was unable to make it out

924
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:33,280
Joji...

925
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:35,820
Have you given the same
version of events to the Police?

926
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,200
Yes
- Oh..

927
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,820
Is there any problem, brother?

928
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:41,360
Not a problem,

929
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:42,650
but..

930
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:46,150
The case would have been solid, if you told
them that you saw him throwing it

931
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:47,990
I couldn't, brother

932
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,860
Don't know whether he threw it
or brother stepped on it..

933
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,650
..Not sure ...could have been
accidental too..

934
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,360
Wouldn't he too get hurt
if it was an accident?

935
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,780
Sam is the Circle Inspector, right?

936
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,240
Yes, of Medayil family

937
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:01,700
He was extremely sensible,

938
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,200
Inquired about the back ground of both of us

939
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:06,780
He understood everything

940
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:09,030
He is an upright officer
not corrupt..

941
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:10,450
His family is traditionally very rich
- Of course

942
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:12,200
We can trace Sudhi if needed

943
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:13,860
He was a good guy

944
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,650
We sat on the same bench in school

945
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,360
Not that sweet anyway

946
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,030
He is one of them

947
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:22,360
if we say something,
the case will take an ugly turn

948
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:23,990
Should we investigate ourselves

949
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:25,280
We can search if needed

950
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,240
Leave it to the Police
- Yeah

951
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:27,950
Don't cause difficulties

952
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:30,030
The gunpowder he possessed is illegal,
That's why he is hiding

953
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:31,360
We can enquire

954
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,070
Even though, should n't we
make some inquries

955
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:36,650
Sunny, is PC there?'
- Yes in Trivandrum

956
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:39,990
Is he available over phone?
- There is an info that he is in Koruthod

957
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,110
Then, call Inspector Sam and pass the info

958
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,240
Please, please....

959
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,570
Please, understand our situation

960
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,200
Our Dad passed first,

961
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:57,650
now brother Jomon too

962
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:01,650
None of us are as powerful as them

963
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:04,200
We don't have the strength either

964
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,320
The family is in deep crisis, Father

965
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,360
Popy is there,

966
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:16,820
he has nobody left

967
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,360
We have to look after him

968
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,070
I understand your emotions

969
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,450
I know how you have rooted for the family

970
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:27,990
We won't forget it

971
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:28,950
in fact we are grateful to you

972
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:33,740
We don't want any fight..

973
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,610
We are tired

974
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:38,450
I have not slept for..

975
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,900
Felix bro, can you give me some medicine?

976
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:44,280
I can't stand this

977
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,700
Joji, You find a girl to marry..then the
problems would go away

978
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,360
What are you talking about?
Is it the time for a marriage proposal?

979
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,450
He should marry

980
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,900
Joji..

981
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,110
Don't worry

982
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:58,860
Of late your family was drifting away
from God's proximity

983
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,610
Consider this as a reminder..

984
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,150
Repent and come back to his path,

985
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:05,860
He will lead you from there

986
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:10,070
Be brave..
Don't worry

987
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:38,950
Did you talk to sister in law?

988
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:40,990
Does she show any interest in Popy?

989
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:42,860
Dear Jaison

990
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:46,490
When I requested her to come
and see him for one last time.

991
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:50,240
..She said that there
is nothing left for her to see.

992
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:52,150
What should I have said?

993
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,860
I have only one regret..

994
01:29:58,450 --> 01:30:01,740
I was the one who poured
the first drink to him

995
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:08,320
We must have shown a little
more concern on him

996
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:12,990
I am trying hard to hold myself together

997
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:17,240
If you lose control, I'll break down

998
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:40,530
Where are you going?

999
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:43,900
Popy is alone, I shall sleep there

1000
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,780
That's nice of you

1001
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,820
Popy
- Mmm..

1002
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:07,780
Son..

1003
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,900
You will grow fast..

1004
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,110
Go out to study,

1005
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:18,610
You will start living alone..

1006
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:22,610
You should give me a promise..

1007
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:25,570
That wherever you go,
you won't touch alcohol

1008
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:54,820
Jomon murder prime suspect
'Thotta Sudhi' surrendered

1009
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:29,650
Need to discuss a matter

1010
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:31,280
Come on in, sit

1011
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:40,820
Look,

1012
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,360
that Totta Sudhi has surrendered

1013
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,610
He is singing many stories

1014
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,950
including that it was you

1015
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:57,110
What else could he say?

1016
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,950
What option does he have?

1017
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,070
I won't be shattered anymore..

1018
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,780
I have a boss now

1019
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,740
I shall report there

1020
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:15,820
I wont fall, either

1021
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:20,280
Look..

1022
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,320
Ok, then

1023
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:28,610
No, tell me..you had some thing to

1024
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:29,530
Nothing

1025
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:30,450
Say it

1026
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:33,820
We will talk later
- No, say it now, no issues

1027
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:34,990
It's nothing

1028
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:36,450
Do you think that I did it?

1029
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,070
Did I say so, asshole?

1030
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,740
If you can give that
3 lakhs any soon...

1031
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:45,990
it's very tight now

1032
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:48,570
It's in my account
I will transfer it

1033
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:51,400
Will transfer
- Mmm

1034
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:36,700
Think straight, you asshole

1035
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,820
Think straight

1036
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:03,070
Bincy..
- Mm

1037
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:05,700
Did you notice anything strange in Joji?

1038
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:08,900
He looked weird, holding a bible

1039
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,820
Hasn't he witness brother's murder?

1040
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,780
He will be far from normal

1041
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:19,950
Mmm

1042
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,110
Who is it?

1043
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,400
Brother Felix

1044
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:29,240
Brother..

1045
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:31,990
Things are getting little complicated

1046
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,900
What happened?

1047
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:36,610
There is an inside info on the forensics
- Mmm

1048
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:39,070
They have some doubts
- Hmm

1049
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:40,990
The Police may come tomorrow

1050
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,860
Oh God
Don't worry, All of us are with you

1051
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:46,740
Police may summon us

1052
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:48,200
Be cautious

1053
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:08,240
Didn't you sleep?

1054
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,990
Police might come tomorrow

1055
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,110
Let them, Bincy

1056
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,070
My only prayer is that you be
in the clear in brother Jomon's death

1057
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,360
Don't bullsh**..

1058
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:25,900
I won't think
you are my sister in law

1059
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,490
I will punch your teeth off

1060
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:36,740
I can't handle it alone

1061
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:38,530
Be calm..all of us are with you

1062
01:36:38,650 --> 01:36:41,200
You please be here, when the Police comes

1063
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,320
I will come after closing the clinic

1064
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,200
Do we need to call the Priest?

1065
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,610
No need..you sleep now, Good night

1066
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:49,700
Goodnight

1067
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,900
They have recovered
airgun pellets from his body

1068
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:01,030
He was shot, they say

1069
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,820
What a crucifixion this is!

1070
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:10,200
Joji's version didn't have
any of these

1071
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:57,610
Jomon murder, airgun pellets found from body in autopsy

1072
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,280
Why are you sitting here?

1073
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:27,570
I was asked to ..they are
discussing something there

1074
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,700
Ok..you sit

1075
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,150
He is coming

1076
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:18,650
What's the matter?

1077
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:21,240
You wait in your room

1078
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,070
I will call

1079
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:25,610
What's the matter?

1080
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:30,780
Have you heard about bullets
being found in his body?

1081
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:32,200
Is it?

1082
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:34,110
Where is my gun, Uncle?

1083
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,950
It will be some where ...

1084
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,990
I see, we could land in trouble if the
Police knows about it, right?

1085
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:51,030
I did not think that way

1086
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:53,070
We will find it

1087
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:55,900
Dad's country gun also should be
stashed some where

1088
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:58,400
The Police will be waiting for something

1089
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:00,030
Leave it there

1090
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:11,070
Have anybody thought
that Sudhi had a gun?

1091
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:13,990
Brother Jomon was right

1092
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,900
Somebody is working against us

1093
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,110
It was me who dropped him at the east canal

1094
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:19,820
He didn't have any gun on him

1095
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:21,450
He might have stashed
in his waist, you ..

1096
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:22,950
Brother, don't try to play games,

1097
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:24,570
we too have common sense

1098
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,780
Why did you do it,
that's the only question remaining

1099
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,200
Yes your honour

1100
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,780
as if you are the Judge!

1101
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:31,610
Get lost. You asshole

1102
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:34,740
Brother, do I need to convince
someone like him

1103
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:37,900
Heh?

1104
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:42,320
Why are you looking at me?

1105
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:44,030
Why do you stare at me?

1106
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,450
First of all sent them out

1107
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:49,320
Brother Jomon was killed by one of them

1108
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,950
Why are you staring?
Get lost

1109
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,700
Let them stay..Joji

1110
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,650
Now we are slightly afraid of you

1111
01:42:01,110 --> 01:42:02,240
Brother..

1112
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,280
Don't test me brother..

1113
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:09,530
You did not have
any issues till yesterday

1114
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:13,030
Do you think I can kill someone?

1115
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:15,360
It was a toy gun, brother

1116
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,740
No it was not..

1117
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,030
It's fatal in close range

1118
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,700
Popy..

1119
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:24,450
What are you
talking about, Son?

1120
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:31,820
Let them test these pellets..
Then the truth will come out

1121
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,650
Everything happens for the good..

1122
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:36,200
Let the Police come

1123
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:40,650
But, I don't deserve this

1124
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,110
You all will regret..

1125
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,450
All of you

1126
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:49,200
Joji..

1127
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:52,320
Stop the charade

1128
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,900
Brother, a word please

1129
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:02,650
Come with me... Please..

1130
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:11,530
What's it?

1131
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,950
Yes, I killed brother Jomon

1132
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:21,740
.. And Dad too

1133
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,530
Bincy knew most part of it

1134
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:28,320
Look Brother..

1135
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:30,780
When Police comes

1136
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:33,650
I will say three of us
were in collusion

1137
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:37,740
..and the cash I gave you
was to hide the fact

1138
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:41,530
I don't give a sh** if you think this is
blackmail..

1139
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:43,570
This is my reality

1140
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,700
You should stand with me..

1141
01:43:48,150 --> 01:43:49,700
Or else everyone goes down with me

1142
01:43:55,150 --> 01:44:02,110
Joji, I won't stand with you even
if you threaten to slit my throat

1143
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:05,950
You too had wished
to see your Dad dead

1144
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:13,320
Dying declaration

1145
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:35,740
Wait Gireesh

1146
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:40,530
Let the Police come

1147
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:09,450
If he can talk

1148
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:12,070
we have to bring the
Magistrate here to take the statement

1149
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:16,200
We can expect only slightest of body
movements, say the eyes..

1150
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:17,240
Is he asleep...

1151
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:18,400
He was awake minutes ago..

1152
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,610
Joji, open your eyes,
Son..Joji...

1153
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:22,530
Joji, it's me..the Doctor

1154
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,450
That's it..

1155
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:25,950
Look who has come..

1156
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:27,700
Somebody has come to see you

1157
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:30,820
Blink if you can see us..

1158
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:33,320
Just a blink, if you can see us..

1159
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,820
There you are.. He can see us..

1160
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,900
Oh..very good

1161
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:41,400
DySP sir has come to see you

1162
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:44,280
He has something to ask

1163
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:45,740
Joji, son..

1164
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:47,610
What to do now?

1165
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:48,990
You didn't die..

1166
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,570
So, it's trouble for you
and us as well

1167
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:54,490
What do you have to tell us?

1168
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:57,200
Do you have a confession to make?

1169
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:00,280
Do you get him?

1170
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:02,450
Do you remember anything?

1171
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:04,900
Do you confess to what you did?

1172
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,950
Please blink, if you do

1173
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:13,610
- Nope he won't
- He is stubborn
