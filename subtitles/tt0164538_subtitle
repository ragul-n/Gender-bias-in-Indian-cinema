1
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:09,334
Halt... Open up.
Just a minute sir.

2
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:13,141
This man's in a hurry.

3
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:14,608
Who's he? Where's he going?

4
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:21,414
Got to catch the Valley Express.
I'm already late. If you'd hurry...

5
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,849
Open the boot.
It's not locked.

6
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,653
Hope there's no bomb in the boot.

7
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:32,128
You'll find bombs
30 kilometers ahead.

8
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:34,290
Move on!

9
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,159
Will we reach the station?
If the Lord wishes.

10
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:04,888
Has the Barrack
Valley Express left?

11
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:06,860
Has the Barrack
Valley Express left?

12
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:11,526
It's running late.
How late?

13
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,163
- 8 hours late.

14
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,036
It's terribly cold!

15
00:02:17,943 --> 00:02:22,108
I'll freeze in this cold!
There's not a soul around.

16
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:25,782
Station master!
You'll have to cremate me!

17
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:28,681
Where are you running to?

18
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:40,860
Matches!

19
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:48,294
Brother! Hey there!

20
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:52,306
Uncle!

21
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:58,209
Do you have a match?

22
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:04,222
Never mind, if you don't have it.

23
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:07,014
Glad to know you're alive.

24
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,830
What do you think?
Will the train arrive?

25
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:18,901
If it does come,
will it also leave?

26
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,497
I hope the bridges
are strong enough.

27
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:27,633
Not built by a dishonest contractor.

28
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:32,050
Because if a bridge collapses,
we'll be in deep trouble.

29
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:35,882
You're the limit!

30
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,979
Forgive me.

31
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,310
Taking you for a man,
I asked you for a match.

32
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:16,420
But you're a girl and
a beautiful one at that.

33
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,360
Forgive me.

34
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:26,266
Do you have a match stick?

35
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:34,247
Don't you ever smile?

36
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:37,774
I mean, it's good to laugh.

37
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:43,711
Don't tell me your name.
My name is Amarkant Varma.

38
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:48,158
Only tell me where you were born.

39
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,591
Or a relative's name...
tell me your mother's name.

40
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:54,497
Maybe you have a dog at home?

41
00:04:56,836 --> 00:05:00,636
No dog? Say something...
Tell me to shut up.

42
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,012
Can I do something for you?

43
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:15,011
I mean, get you the stars
or the moon? Conquer a fort?

44
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,651
But no match stick!

45
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:24,927
You're all alone.
Can I get you something?

46
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,156
A cup of hot tea.

47
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:32,826
Don't go away. I'll just get it.

48
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:35,735
There's a bomb in my suitcase.

49
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,509
If you move it will...!

50
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:58,362
Uncle.

51
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:01,165
Make us some special tea.

52
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:05,370
Closed for the day.
No, my future depends on this.

53
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,201
Here's the money.

54
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:14,112
Make a nice cup. With cream.

55
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,016
I'll take some biscuits as well.

56
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:22,144
The station master said the
train is running 8 hours late.

57
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:24,346
That's another train.

58
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:26,850
Hope she's not taking it.
What did you say?

59
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:31,894
Nothing. You make the tea.
I'll add the sugar.

60
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:18,043
This must be the
shortest love story.

61
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,653
What's your name?

62
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:45,955
Where's the boss?
The vegetable market.

63
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,625
You're all cheats!

64
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:53,365
Not one paise extra!

65
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:59,399
Am I new to these parts?

66
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:04,541
Are you from All India Radio?
Yes, but after this fight. Cheats!

67
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:08,609
Do you have change
for 50 bucks?

68
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:11,408
Give me 20 bucks.
What? Yes...

69
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:17,014
No, it's not fair.
It's absolutely fair.

70
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:26,221
Put this away...
I owe you 20 bucks.

71
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:30,094
Couldn't talk to you while
arguing, or I'd forget the abuses.

72
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,999
I knew it would be you.

73
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:42,706
Don't throw the cigarette. India
can't bear any kind of wastage.

74
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:47,211
What do you think of the last
50 years of India's independence?

75
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:50,946
What progress have we made?

76
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:55,682
What freedom? We have no freedom.

77
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:08,937
Village leaders got only more
powerful and started fleecing us.

78
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:10,899
Has free India made any progress?

79
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:14,774
No. The central government threatens
us and keeps us cowed down.

80
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,879
Atrocities are inflicted
on the poor and innocent.

81
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:21,043
And you say we are free!
Is this what freedom means?

82
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,518
Louder.
No progress at all.

83
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:27,716
We have progressed.
No way!

84
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:31,754
Do you feel India has progressed?
Yes.

85
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:34,864
India is the best.

86
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,297
Have you ever met these
terrorists or their leaders?

87
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:47,375
I have two children.
Don't want to see me happy?

88
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:54,445
I'm going to meet them.
Are you crazy? Why?

89
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:57,919
For an interview.
You won't return alive.

90
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,817
I already told him that.

91
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,153
We work for the radio,
not for the newspapers.

92
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:06,193
We don't have to
sensationalise news.

93
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:08,423
They are dangerous people.

94
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:12,594
It's my job to find out
after 50 years of independence...

95
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:14,806
...what is the average
Indian's mindset?

96
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:18,067
For that you need to get into
the jungles and meet with them?

97
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,804
They are citizens of our country.
And are upset.

98
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:23,875
We must find out why,
and what they think.

99
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,106
It's impossible.
You won't find them.

100
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,846
We've spoken to them. The jeep is
on its way. Didn't you tell her?

101
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:34,959
Yes. Have you made
all these arrangements?

102
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:40,857
Actually, last night,
he saw some trees...

103
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:43,198
Since then he's been screaming
to see either trees or...

104
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:46,961
You don't find trees in Delhi.

105
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:07,250
I have to give you something.

106
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,018
A cup of piping hot tea.

107
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,661
Will you have it here or
prefer to go to a restaurant?

108
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,423
Or there's a good joint...
Move out of my way.

109
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:19,201
Maybe you haven't recognised me.
We met at the railway station.

110
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:22,601
I asked you for a match.
Match?

111
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:28,803
You were covered in a dark shawl.
No.

112
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:33,203
Look, I don't know you.

113
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,982
You are mistaken. You must
have seen somebody else.

114
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:46,788
Wasn't that you?

115
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,049
Not to you.

116
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:32,941
Can you see anything?

117
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:34,769
I see the gong of death!

118
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:40,346
Don't be afraid.

119
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:42,912
Listen.
What is it?

120
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:47,815
Brother. Yes?
Sounds like a female.

121
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:51,286
What's your name?

122
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:55,596
I wanted to ask if... you...

123
00:19:56,634 --> 00:20:02,366
What's your age? And since when
are you doing this? Sister.

124
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:07,174
I've 2 wives and 8 kids.
I'm fed up. Why do you do this?

125
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,942
Yes. Come soon.

126
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:21,221
We are. Let me drink the tea.
Don't pester me.

127
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:24,294
Don't be angry now.

128
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,173
This is for the radio.

129
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,375
You won't speak in my tongue.

130
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:47,381
But I must speak in your language?

131
00:20:56,826 --> 00:21:02,856
First of all I wanted to ask,
you look just like us.

132
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:06,000
Absolutely normal.
What did you think?

133
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:15,135
What's your aim?

134
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,346
Independence.

135
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:22,009
From whom?
Your government. India.

136
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:25,788
Why?
Why?

137
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:31,184
I mean why?
India became free 50 years ago.

138
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:36,125
Many promises were made to us.
Not one was kept.

139
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:40,663
We have been oppressed.

140
00:21:40,903 --> 00:21:42,874
Yet the nation is yours.

141
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:46,374
No. You feel Delhi is India.

142
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:50,442
The states in the far flung area
have no meaning for you.

143
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,517
Because they are small, not big.

144
00:21:56,989 --> 00:22:01,423
Delhi cares about places
that have vote banks.

145
00:22:02,294 --> 00:22:04,088
Terrorism...
We are not terrorists.

146
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:10,391
Where do you get weapons from?

147
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:13,497
Where did you get this courage?

148
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:16,866
Where do you get weapons?
Anywhere.

149
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:19,605
So China and Pakistan help you?

150
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:23,246
These weapons come here and you...
I can't tell you any more.

151
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:26,182
You've given guns to little kids.

152
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:29,548
Made them terrorists
only for your selfish motives...

153
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,951
That is too much!

154
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:46,969
He can join us.

155
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:50,373
The same courage and dedication.

156
00:22:51,977 --> 00:22:57,471
If you lose your job at the radio
station, you can come and join us.

157
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:06,278
It is night at the station...
He was waiting...

158
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,980
...for the train,
but the rains came.

159
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:13,556
Playing like a child.
Piercing through the sky.

160
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,402
The trees were swaying as if
they had lost their senses.

161
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:20,201
The tin-roofs danced in
gay abandon with each other.

162
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:23,074
Such was the fury of the sky.

163
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:26,402
As if it would drown the world!

164
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:30,875
In the midst of this, he saw
somebody on the dark platform.

165
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,817
Brother, do you have a match?

166
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:41,815
A gust of wind blew the
cloth off the stranger's head...

167
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:44,890
A girl.

168
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:54,996
Dark black, but little eyes.

169
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:57,971
High cheek bones.

170
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:04,007
A flat nose as if somebody
had pasted it on in a rush.

171
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:12,653
One look and he decided to save her
from the villains and carry her away.

172
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,825
But he had neither horses
nor were there any villains.

173
00:24:18,363 --> 00:24:23,923
Forgive me. I thought you were
a man and asked you for a match.

174
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:27,434
Her answer. Nothing.

175
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,034
Her eyes... full of magic.

176
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:35,943
Not even a smile.

177
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:39,313
Why doesn't she ask something?

178
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,749
All of a sudden...

179
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,287
As if pearls are falling...

180
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,855
She says... tea.

181
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:55,798
Today is going to be different.

182
00:24:56,401 --> 00:25:00,303
Meaning? Amar is
looking after everything today.

183
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,434
He gets hot tea in a floral glass.

184
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,403
He runs hard.

185
00:25:06,644 --> 00:25:09,770
So as not to spill any.

186
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:19,444
But a train that would be offended
to halt at this little station...

187
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:25,319
I looked at the train. I didn't
know whether it was mine or hers.

188
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:27,962
The guard showed the red
along with the green flag.

189
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,789
I ran towards the train.

190
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:39,709
The train left.

191
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:42,644
She too left.

192
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,278
Here.

193
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,823
Is a rupee stamp sufficient?

194
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:59,363
I'm standing here. Just a minute.

195
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:28,989
Can I talk to him?
No local calls.

196
00:26:29,227 --> 00:26:30,489
I know.

197
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:34,757
The meter is not working.
Will this do?

198
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:44,038
Make the call only if
you have the change.

199
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:46,240
All right.

200
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:51,107
Twenty rupees. Full rate.

201
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:56,615
Join politics.

202
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:12,394
This is wrong. You've met me twice
and yet, refuse to recognise me.

203
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:13,730
Stop following me.

204
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:16,169
No.
You will have to.

205
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,136
Why?
I don't like it.

206
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:22,038
I don't believe it.
I...

207
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:24,405
What's the problem?

208
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:27,913
Is it your parents, caste,
community... religion?

209
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:30,144
Or the two gangsters in the train?

210
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,516
I can even talk to them.

211
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:35,817
Even if I have to use my fists...
It's not that.

212
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:41,025
I don't like it. Leave me alone.

213
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:44,096
You don't like me?

214
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:53,069
Hope you won't follow me now.

215
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:26,536
It's done!

216
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,461
Did you talk?
Yes.

217
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:49,230
Have you eaten?
Yes.

218
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:05,775
Who is it?

219
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:11,882
Now where are you going?
I'll be back.

220
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,146
Go anywhere. As if I care.

221
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:32,371
Go away!

222
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:35,039
Will you come with me?

223
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,479
I'm not what you think I am.

224
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:47,019
How do you know what I think?

225
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:53,929
I've found you with great difficulty.
How can I let you go so easily?

226
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:58,230
Either you tell your family.

227
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,164
Or I'll talk to them.
Think it over and tell me.

228
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:04,604
What do you know about me?

229
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:10,538
Nothing except that I love you.

230
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,345
With all my heart.

231
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:22,853
Surprised? Worried?

232
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:25,789
Angry?

233
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:30,056
I don't believe
in one-sided love.

234
00:35:31,668 --> 00:35:35,070
There must be something between us.

235
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:39,402
The only difference being you're
not willing to accept the truth.

236
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,237
And I do.

237
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:46,416
What's the matter? No courage?

238
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:49,248
The truth...
Leave me alone!

239
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:52,617
Answer a question of mine.

240
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:54,722
Then I won't bother you.
You don't know anything.

241
00:35:54,893 --> 00:35:57,018
I've come to find out.
You are very wrong.

242
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:59,559
Why don't you understand?
You don't tell me anything.

243
00:35:59,764 --> 00:36:02,425
How can I understand?
I am married.

244
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:09,969
Now you won't follow me?

245
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:13,467
To whom?

246
00:36:14,478 --> 00:36:18,108
The man with you in the train?
Yes.

247
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:23,409
One moment.

248
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,092
Nothing.

249
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:40,934
How can I love a married girl?

250
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,204
Infatuation, not love.

251
00:36:48,545 --> 00:36:53,539
Get in. Your books must be
on the table in 5 minutes.

252
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,416
What do I do?

253
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,686
Forget her.

254
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:03,922
There's no shortage of girls.

255
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,719
I don't mean that.

256
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:10,099
I must apologise to her.

257
00:37:12,135 --> 00:37:15,367
Then do so.
It's necessary.

258
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:18,539
I must apologise to her.

259
00:37:27,585 --> 00:37:28,882
She's come.

260
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:41,755
Is she the one?

261
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:45,661
Why has she brought this gang?

262
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:56,268
You wanted to apologise to the girl.
So why are the men coming here?

263
00:37:56,813 --> 00:37:58,338
Her husband.

264
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,574
Two husbands?
You have 2 wives.

265
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:04,777
There's a lot of difference
between a husband and a wife.

266
00:38:09,793 --> 00:38:12,820
Listen, we want to talk to you.

267
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:15,396
Pardon me?
We want to talk.

268
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:18,693
Yes?
In privacy.

269
00:38:19,036 --> 00:38:20,402
Talk here.

270
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:23,597
There's no need to worry.
Come on.

271
00:38:24,342 --> 00:38:27,936
Go ahead. I'll tell
madam you'll be late.

272
00:38:28,846 --> 00:38:30,780
Why don't you go?

273
00:38:54,672 --> 00:38:58,266
I must tell you
some things clearly.

274
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:01,070
I'm a government servant.

275
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:05,340
If anything happens to me,
the matter goes to the police.

276
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,708
And also to the government.

277
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:11,820
I also have quite a few
terrorist friends.

278
00:39:12,056 --> 00:39:14,181
I know the leader very well.

279
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:18,222
Don't listen to him.
I was a bo xing champ at college.

280
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:20,920
I can throw a bottle in the
air and break it with another.

281
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:24,101
Don't say I didn't warn you.

282
00:39:24,302 --> 00:39:28,032
What do we do with him?
What do you mean?

283
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:32,264
So you're a policeman?
I'm not a policeman.

284
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:35,777
I work for the radio.
Look like a policeman!

285
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,880
What do you do?

286
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:43,010
Why are you talking to him?
Drag him out!

287
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:45,188
Let us talk.
What are you doing here?

288
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:48,891
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

289
00:39:49,126 --> 00:39:51,117
Want to get a girl married?

290
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,922
Pull him out!

291
00:39:54,132 --> 00:39:56,429
Don't touch me. Just talk.

292
00:39:57,335 --> 00:39:59,530
And you behave yourself.

293
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:01,532
Explain to him.

294
00:40:01,972 --> 00:40:04,965
We live in the hills.
We have some rules and customs.

295
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:08,806
It will be better if
you leave the girl alone.

296
00:40:11,282 --> 00:40:13,340
What if I don't?

297
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:16,681
I told you not to touch me!

298
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:19,478
I didn't know she knows you!

299
00:40:20,056 --> 00:40:22,786
I told you not to touch me!

300
00:40:26,364 --> 00:40:28,797
I didn't know she was married!

301
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:39,668
In any case, your
women have 5 husbands.

302
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,811
Our sisters don't marry outside.

303
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:55,585
Is she your sister?

304
00:40:58,027 --> 00:41:00,054
And yours?

305
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:02,755
She's my cousin.

306
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:08,465
Is she married?

307
00:41:28,025 --> 00:41:29,889
Did you see him?
Yes, there.

308
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:32,789
The rascals threw him here.

309
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:38,496
Stop! Back.

310
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:44,605
Where?
There!

311
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:01,052
Got beaten black
and blue for her!

312
00:42:01,324 --> 00:42:03,554
Now do you intend
to work or not?

313
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,826
What?
Says no.

314
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,293
You won't forget that girl.

315
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:15,030
Yes?
Her...

316
00:42:21,445 --> 00:42:24,505
What's he saying?
Marriage...

317
00:42:25,983 --> 00:42:30,282
She's not married.
She's not married?

318
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:33,150
She's not married!

319
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:39,324
She says they've left.
They'd come for 2 months.

320
00:42:39,496 --> 00:42:43,297
Where have they gone?
I don't know.

321
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,063
When did they leave?
Some time ago.

322
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:52,364
Are you the girl's grandmother?

323
00:42:57,347 --> 00:43:00,612
She says the girl was lovely.
I wish I was her grandma.

324
00:43:00,818 --> 00:43:02,786
From where had they come?
From where had they come?

325
00:43:03,186 --> 00:43:05,677
From the city.

326
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:08,922
Doesn't she know
where they've gone?

327
00:43:12,063 --> 00:43:15,054
Don't know.
She knows nothing.

328
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:20,500
What's she saying?
The girl was good, boys useless.

329
00:43:21,072 --> 00:43:25,304
Don't know what they
always talked about.

330
00:43:25,543 --> 00:43:28,909
Only the girl would run around.

331
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:38,181
Attend to the phone.
Why can't you?

332
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:45,085
Amar?
Mother, it's brother on the line.

333
00:43:45,996 --> 00:43:48,829
How are you? Talk to grandma.
Give me the line.

334
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:53,833
Ask him why he hasn't written!
I'm growing even more old!

335
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:57,235
Grandma is growing older!
When is he returning?

336
00:43:57,775 --> 00:44:00,208
Come back soon.
Give me the line!

337
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:05,043
We are very worried! The newspapers
publish some terrible news everyday.

338
00:44:05,248 --> 00:44:08,114
Take care of yourself.
Let me also talk!

339
00:44:08,485 --> 00:44:11,751
Your Dad's friend
from the army, Mr Nair...

340
00:44:11,956 --> 00:44:13,514
...is bringing his daughter here.

341
00:44:13,724 --> 00:44:15,748
When should he come?

342
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:20,056
After 5 years.
When are you coming?

343
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:23,023
May you live long.
One minute.

344
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,657
Bring something for me.
It's not a local call.

345
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:28,702
Give it to me!

346
00:44:34,045 --> 00:44:36,478
That girl doesn't come these days.

347
00:44:44,088 --> 00:44:47,887
Do you know the number the
girl would dial from here?

348
00:44:48,092 --> 00:44:50,458
I have a record of all the
numbers dialled from here.

349
00:44:50,628 --> 00:44:54,996
Can you tell me?
Why not? But Why?

350
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:58,358
I had a fight with her.

351
00:44:58,568 --> 00:45:00,969
I wanted to talk to her.

352
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:04,572
I don't give out numbers like this.

353
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,471
It's a government office.
What office?

354
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,706
Keep this.
No!

355
00:45:17,454 --> 00:45:18,648
Yes?

356
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:32,699
What code is this?

357
00:46:21,184 --> 00:46:23,050
Yes, it's almost over.

358
00:46:23,987 --> 00:46:27,355
I'll assume I'd lost
my head for a few days.

359
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:30,920
But don't tell anyone.

360
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:43,201
Pay up!

361
00:46:50,514 --> 00:46:52,744
Move aside.

362
00:46:56,987 --> 00:47:01,753
The army shot a running man.

363
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:31,844
I'm from All India Radio.
I want to know what happened.

364
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:34,280
Hurry up.

365
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:39,251
Isn't this a violation
against human rights?

366
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:45,891
Human rights! Ask him... He was
blowing up school kids with RDX!

367
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:32,143
Recognize me?

368
00:48:32,882 --> 00:48:35,545
Your husband is not to be seen.

369
00:48:35,753 --> 00:48:37,686
Sent him to thrash somebody?

370
00:48:37,922 --> 00:48:39,913
I don't have a husband.

371
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:43,650
Are you looking for one?

372
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,295
Who are you?
Why have you come here?

373
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,027
Come to cover the festival?

374
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:56,228
And you?
I'm with him.

375
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,034
His wife? Whose kids are these?

376
00:49:00,244 --> 00:49:02,838
Are you my wife?

377
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:09,943
She's my wife.
We've been married for 25 years!

378
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:18,293
Wife! Let me knew if
somebody is to be thrashed.

379
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:04,530
Give me a hand. Help the kids.

380
00:50:04,742 --> 00:50:07,233
Mother this way.

381
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:11,643
Where are these people going?
To Kargill.

382
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:15,947
How long will it take?
2 days.

383
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:21,989
The route is long. Let's walk.

384
00:50:36,106 --> 00:50:37,333
Throw carefully!

385
00:50:41,344 --> 00:50:43,277
I'm talking to you.

386
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,043
Stop!

387
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:52,686
What do you want?
Some answers.

388
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:57,184
I've been betrayed.

389
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,262
I was beaten up and
dumped in an isolated spot.

390
00:51:01,465 --> 00:51:04,228
And today I am your husband?

391
00:51:04,434 --> 00:51:08,302
Don't you think I'd have some
questions for you to answer?

392
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:11,335
By what name do I address you?

393
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:13,632
Real or false?

394
00:51:15,045 --> 00:51:18,014
Who were those men?
My brothers.

395
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:21,614
Just as Rajiv Gandhi is mine? Why
did you lie that you were married?

396
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:25,353
If I hadn't, would you have left me?

397
00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:28,420
No.
That is why.

398
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:31,456
Don't try to act innocent.

399
00:51:31,628 --> 00:51:33,686
I know you're not as
innocent as you look.

400
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:35,822
Will I dance to your tunes
all my life?

401
00:51:35,998 --> 00:51:37,989
Your game is exposed!

402
00:51:38,168 --> 00:51:41,626
You love to tease boys.

403
00:51:42,706 --> 00:51:44,936
Know what we call girls like you?

404
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:46,541
We call them fast.

405
00:51:46,777 --> 00:51:49,268
You really hate me.

406
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,938
Yes; with all my heart.

407
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:59,449
Look into my eyes and say that.

408
00:53:00,817 --> 00:53:02,876
Here, take some water.

409
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:52,056
Haven't you ever seen a girl?

410
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:17,827
Where are you going?
Call back your husband, too.

411
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:46,155
Let's go back.
A storm is raging.

412
00:54:46,356 --> 00:54:49,222
There's some innocence
still left in you.

413
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:52,360
Everyone has gone
to a cave nearby.

414
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:56,793
Sometimes, somebody is ahead
at others they follow behind.

415
00:55:51,688 --> 00:55:53,552
What's the matter?

416
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,157
What's wrong?

417
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:08,398
Tell me what happened!

418
00:56:11,907 --> 00:56:14,342
You are in tears.
What is it?

419
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,271
Can't you speak?

420
00:56:19,315 --> 00:56:21,840
Has this happened before?

421
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:24,219
Has this happened before?

422
00:56:25,554 --> 00:56:31,960
The more you try to hide it,
the more it will torment you.

423
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,762
Don't hold your feelings back!

424
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:38,237
Please move aside.

425
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:44,347
Come with me.

426
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,556
One minute.

427
01:04:53,262 --> 01:04:56,561
Do you follow Hindi?
Yes, a bit.

428
01:04:57,666 --> 01:05:01,534
I want to marry her.

429
01:05:02,204 --> 01:05:04,570
When?
Right now.

430
01:05:07,242 --> 01:05:11,474
Excuse me, he's mad.

431
01:05:19,822 --> 01:05:23,052
What have I said that's crazy?

432
01:05:24,661 --> 01:05:27,425
Just because I want to
marry you?

433
01:05:27,896 --> 01:05:34,530
Will anybody say something
stupid in such a holy place?

434
01:05:42,612 --> 01:05:44,409
But you never asked me.

435
01:05:45,914 --> 01:05:47,472
Then I'll ask you now.

436
01:05:48,518 --> 01:05:50,815
Will you marry me?

437
01:05:53,255 --> 01:05:54,985
No.

438
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,626
I don't have the time.

439
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:06,233
Don't have the time?

440
01:06:13,943 --> 01:06:16,503
Suppose we do get married.

441
01:06:16,777 --> 01:06:19,838
Not now. Now we don't have time.

442
01:06:21,985 --> 01:06:25,545
Suppose we get married.
What do you think...

443
01:06:25,788 --> 01:06:28,585
Will we be happy together?

444
01:06:28,824 --> 01:06:31,088
Lots of love and happiness?

445
01:06:31,393 --> 01:06:35,831
Then we'll fight. Break heads.

446
01:06:37,132 --> 01:06:39,931
But let me make one thing clear.
I won't accept defeat.

447
01:06:40,168 --> 01:06:42,728
You'll have to make the
first move to make up.

448
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:44,735
You won't?

449
01:06:44,974 --> 01:06:48,568
Meaning, I'll have to
apologise to you?

450
01:06:50,947 --> 01:06:54,541
But once the kids come, no fights.

451
01:06:54,751 --> 01:06:58,083
No, they will be involved, too.

452
01:06:59,822 --> 01:07:03,416
Really? How many kids
will we have?

453
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,927
One?

454
01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:09,626
Two? Three? Four?

455
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,458
Eight?

456
01:07:13,702 --> 01:07:17,434
But they have to resemble me.

457
01:07:17,672 --> 01:07:21,666
Look like me.
Then you keep them!

458
01:07:22,277 --> 01:07:24,838
If not me, should
they look like you?

459
01:07:25,081 --> 01:07:27,947
This flat nose!
This flat nose?

460
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:32,681
Didn't anyone ever tell you
only your smile is all right?

461
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,789
Do you know what it
means to hit like this?

462
01:07:36,992 --> 01:07:39,324
You like me very much.

463
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,260
Hitting like this...

464
01:07:42,498 --> 01:07:45,228
...means you love me very much.

465
01:07:46,835 --> 01:07:50,567
This means you can't
live without me!

466
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,742
I'll die.
Really?

467
01:07:56,411 --> 01:07:57,936
Just like this.

468
01:07:58,481 --> 01:08:00,277
Who is asking you to die?

469
01:08:00,516 --> 01:08:03,007
Say you love me.

470
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:08,717
I've no time.

471
01:08:14,063 --> 01:08:16,827
Don't desert the old lady.

472
01:08:21,938 --> 01:08:24,532
Why didn't they take them along?
Left them with us for nothing!

473
01:08:24,738 --> 01:08:28,140
They understand Hindi.
And the language of the heart?

474
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:33,305
If they don't leave us alone,
when will we romance?

475
01:08:47,962 --> 01:08:50,261
What's wrong? Not sleepy?

476
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,988
I am, but I won't sleep.

477
01:08:52,234 --> 01:08:54,997
Why? Are you scared of me?

478
01:08:55,238 --> 01:09:01,404
My family taught me the one who
sleeps in a strange land loses all.

479
01:09:02,278 --> 01:09:05,770
You are scared.
No.

480
01:09:06,412 --> 01:09:09,042
Do you have any idea
what fear is?

481
01:09:09,752 --> 01:09:13,881
Now we won't argue or fight.

482
01:09:14,354 --> 01:09:16,018
We'll just talk.

483
01:09:16,457 --> 01:09:19,724
What do you like the best?

484
01:09:20,095 --> 01:09:22,689
Answer quickly. I'll count to 3

485
01:09:23,564 --> 01:09:25,625
- 1, 2...
Mother's hands.

486
01:09:26,569 --> 01:09:29,800
Mother's hands. Second?

487
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,734
The pigeons of the village temple.

488
01:09:35,377 --> 01:09:38,836
Third?
Poetry.

489
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:46,317
A local song?

490
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:53,886
What do you dislike the most?

491
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:00,100
I don't like you getting close.

492
01:10:00,301 --> 01:10:05,832
That's a lie
Your laughter and mischief.

493
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:12,212
The zest in you.

494
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:16,314
Wrong. Actually you envy me.

495
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:21,645
Yes.

496
01:10:24,594 --> 01:10:26,653
You tell me what you like.

497
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:30,627
First I'll tell you
what I don't like.

498
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:37,296
I hate this distance between us.

499
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:44,511
All that is hidden within you.
And I hate your eyes the most.

500
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:51,279
However hard I try,
I can't read anything in them.

501
01:10:52,988 --> 01:10:55,752
Now I'll tell you what I like.

502
01:10:59,395 --> 01:11:01,886
I like your eyes the most.

503
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:07,733
Because however hard I try,
I read nothing in them.

504
01:11:10,171 --> 01:11:13,104
There's so much hidden in you.

505
01:11:13,442 --> 01:11:15,408
I like that very much.

506
01:11:17,813 --> 01:11:20,782
And I like this
distance the best.

507
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:27,011
Because if not for this distance,
I would have no excuse to get closer.

508
01:11:58,453 --> 01:11:59,783
Go to sleep.

509
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:01,786
Just sleep?

510
01:12:02,024 --> 01:12:03,992
With your mouth shut.

511
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:14,756
Some people are like names
written in the sand.

512
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:20,127
Just one gust of wind
blows them away.

513
01:13:42,425 --> 01:13:45,256
Go!

514
01:13:49,698 --> 01:13:52,599
Go away!

515
01:14:33,242 --> 01:14:38,337
This aim of our revolutionis the freedom for our country.

516
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,778
This aim of our revolution
is the freedom for our country.

517
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:48,480
For this, we will sacrifice
our bodies and our lives.

518
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:51,850
We also accept...

519
01:14:52,095 --> 01:14:55,962
...our commander and his aim.h

520
01:14:56,167 --> 01:15:00,864
We will sacrifice ourselves
for the attainment of these goals.

521
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:04,038
We do solemnly swear.

522
01:18:39,023 --> 01:18:41,514
The time draws near.

523
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:43,953
The passport is ready.

524
01:18:44,194 --> 01:18:46,960
The entry passes
have been arranged.

525
01:18:47,163 --> 01:18:50,930
The dress rehearsal
is on 23rd. Friday.

526
01:18:51,202 --> 01:18:52,725
What about the car passes, etc?

527
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:55,063
Don't use them.

528
01:18:55,305 --> 01:18:58,002
I'll play you a song...
Any song of your choice.

529
01:18:58,207 --> 01:18:59,970
My choice?
Has my stuff arrived?

530
01:19:00,144 --> 01:19:02,908
It's on the table. Take it.
Okay.

531
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:07,676
This song is for Dinu and
his friends and... that's all.

532
01:20:36,305 --> 01:20:38,739
Have you fixed up the house?

533
01:20:38,975 --> 01:20:41,774
Plan out what you need.

534
01:21:48,746 --> 01:21:50,234
Be careful.

535
01:21:52,983 --> 01:21:54,676
You've come?

536
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:58,877
Amar has been waiting impatiently.

537
01:22:22,179 --> 01:22:23,645
Kids!

538
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:41,154
May I say something before you do?

539
01:22:47,703 --> 01:22:50,171
Can I talk informally?

540
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:51,863
Whatever...

541
01:22:56,979 --> 01:22:59,951
There was a boy I loved.

542
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,618
He too loved me.

543
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,877
In college. 

544
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,716
One spoonful of sugar?

545
01:23:11,996 --> 01:23:14,328
He found a job in Dubai.

546
01:23:15,131 --> 01:23:20,194
And when the question arose;
Dubai or me...

547
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:29,203
Is that his name?

548
01:23:30,846 --> 01:23:32,475
No, he is.

549
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:37,050
That means an idiot, an ass.

550
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:46,194
I'm telling you this because
our families want us married.

551
01:23:46,497 --> 01:23:48,965
And I don't want you to...

552
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:52,693
Don't worry about that.

553
01:23:54,136 --> 01:23:57,505
By the way, even I went
through this.

554
01:24:00,144 --> 01:24:02,908
Love or lost?s

555
01:24:04,948 --> 01:24:06,109
Both.

556
01:24:07,152 --> 01:24:09,210
Did the girl ditch you?

557
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,479
Yes.

558
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:17,349
Didn't you feel like
slapping her hard?

559
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,867
I felt like wringing her neck.

560
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,332
And killing her!

561
01:24:30,509 --> 01:24:32,533
Shake!

562
01:24:42,185 --> 01:24:45,451
They feel the promises made
to them were not kept.

563
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:47,680
The bigger states have
grabbed their rights.

564
01:24:47,823 --> 01:24:49,850
The cause for this
are the politicians

565
01:24:50,027 --> 01:24:52,859
Who feel they are not important.

566
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:56,556
These rumours have been spread
by nations across the border.

567
01:24:56,832 --> 01:25:01,134
We've invested money in the north
east area without expecting returns.

568
01:25:01,372 --> 01:25:05,864
Then where does the money go?

569
01:25:06,475 --> 01:25:09,377
Businessmen or middlemen grab it?

570
01:25:09,578 --> 01:25:11,810
They are all hand in glove!

571
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:15,009
Is this for the radio?
Yes. All India.

572
01:25:21,957 --> 01:25:23,426
Food.

573
01:25:27,162 --> 01:25:28,756
I don't know.
One last question.

574
01:25:28,966 --> 01:25:32,162
Who is responsible?
Politics or the politician?

575
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:35,429
How can we celebrate
50 years of independence...

576
01:25:35,639 --> 01:25:39,506
When there are so many problems
in the border states...?

577
01:25:56,091 --> 01:26:00,086
I mean, did you just love
that girl quietly or...

578
01:26:00,264 --> 01:26:03,563
Did something ever happen?

579
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:08,966
I don't want an answer.

580
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:12,662
I just wanted to see
if you get shocked.

581
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:15,672
If I ask you the same question?s

582
01:26:15,877 --> 01:26:20,509
Sure. But what do you think?

583
01:26:24,087 --> 01:26:26,318
I feel you talk too much.

584
01:26:26,523 --> 01:26:31,018
And also at this moment,
there's lettuce on your nose...

585
01:26:34,162 --> 01:26:38,658
But 80%% of the girls of today...

586
01:26:38,935 --> 01:26:41,769
Before marriage... 

587
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:56,877
So you're from the remaining 20%%

588
01:26:58,787 --> 01:27:02,087
What else? I didn't have the guts.

589
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,591
Tell you something?i

590
01:27:04,828 --> 01:27:07,989
Looks like you're from the 20%% too

591
01:27:13,703 --> 01:27:16,296
Thinking about that girl?

592
01:27:16,506 --> 01:27:19,237
No.
Is that true or a lie?g

593
01:27:20,243 --> 01:27:23,234
Lie.
Forget that lie.

594
01:27:23,412 --> 01:27:26,872
Tell me a lie about me.o

595
01:27:28,286 --> 01:27:30,219
What lies can I tell about you?

596
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:33,617
That I'm very beautiful.

597
01:27:33,823 --> 01:27:37,920
I'm wonderful, and so on.

598
01:27:39,328 --> 01:27:43,855
You're very beautiful,
wonderful, and so on.

599
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:50,206
You do lie beautifully.

600
01:27:54,377 --> 01:27:57,038
At home, everybody
must be waiting for us.

601
01:27:57,247 --> 01:28:00,648
To see if we say yes or no.

602
01:28:00,884 --> 01:28:06,377
So if you don't like me,
you can say so. So will I.

603
01:28:07,224 --> 01:28:09,590
But a yes...

604
01:28:14,465 --> 01:28:17,591
I want to talk to you. Stay there.

605
01:28:29,212 --> 01:28:31,475
I want to talk to you.

606
01:28:53,636 --> 01:28:58,233
Stop! I want to talk to you!

607
01:29:31,475 --> 01:29:33,067
Please forgive me.

608
01:29:33,277 --> 01:29:35,243
Hope you're not hurt.

609
01:29:40,317 --> 01:29:42,148
What's the matter?d

610
01:29:42,819 --> 01:29:45,412
Where are you running off to?

611
01:29:58,036 --> 01:30:00,502
Strip and check him.w

612
01:30:03,038 --> 01:30:05,099
What is this?s

613
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:08,372
He's swallowed it!
Take it out!

614
01:30:16,653 --> 01:30:18,917
Forget about her.
She's just a dream

615
01:30:26,462 --> 01:30:28,625
I thought you loved a girl.e

616
01:30:28,832 --> 01:30:31,460
But you were chasing a man.

617
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:36,069
Are you a normal man?

618
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:38,237
Hope you're not...s

619
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:46,680
I thought might
as well ask. No harm

620
01:30:46,948 --> 01:30:48,712
This way. Your purse.

621
01:31:11,073 --> 01:31:14,564
Kim was caught in Connaught Place.

622
01:31:15,377 --> 01:31:16,676
God knows how.s

623
01:31:16,912 --> 01:31:20,747
The police even found his cyanide.

624
01:31:21,885 --> 01:31:25,011
And he swallowed it.w

625
01:31:26,456 --> 01:31:28,422
They have come!

626
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,421
What are kids doing here? Go up.

627
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:38,457
So what have you thought?

628
01:31:38,902 --> 01:31:42,564
We had lunch and were
returning in a bus, Dad.

629
01:31:42,773 --> 01:31:45,502
When a man started running.
Amar ran after him.

630
01:31:45,742 --> 01:31:50,907
I ran after him and in this
running, we couldn't talk.

631
01:31:51,046 --> 01:31:53,813
We only want to know yes or no.

632
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,747
How can we say anything so soon...?

633
01:31:57,487 --> 01:32:01,252
We've just met...
I accept.

634
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:10,725
But ask her once.

635
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:13,969
What do we assume?

636
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:21,636
Say yes!

637
01:32:24,948 --> 01:32:27,679
Answer her! Say yes!

638
01:32:28,484 --> 01:32:31,420
I won't say anything.
Please.

639
01:32:33,657 --> 01:32:36,125
No!
She accepted!o

640
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:44,359
Look at his body. Blood red.

641
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,536
His eyes have turned blue.

642
01:32:46,737 --> 01:32:50,434
His tongue and lips are the same.

643
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:54,139
There will be deposits of
potassium cyanide in his stomach.

644
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:56,176
Could he have survived?

645
01:32:56,313 --> 01:32:59,247
He may have died in 10 minutes.

646
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:03,943
There was a 40%% chance if
a malnitrate was administered.

647
01:33:04,988 --> 01:33:07,011
Have you seen this?

648
01:33:09,027 --> 01:33:12,018
Looks like some notation.

649
01:33:12,261 --> 01:33:14,560
Find out.
Look up the yellow pages.

650
01:33:14,729 --> 01:33:18,497
Check every music shop
in the vicinity

651
01:33:27,243 --> 01:33:29,474
God knows what the police
must have got out of him.

652
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:31,841
I'm sure he won't divulge anything.

653
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:34,246
He won't say a word.

654
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:39,814
Stop crying.

655
01:33:40,488 --> 01:33:42,185
He was like her brother.

656
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:44,622
There are no brothers
or sisters here.

657
01:33:44,859 --> 01:33:47,091
We haven't come here to cry!

658
01:33:47,465 --> 01:33:50,024
He wouldn't like your tears!

659
01:33:51,402 --> 01:33:54,599
He was a soldier who was
martyred in the battle!

660
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:57,631
He didn't die as
somebody's brother.

661
01:33:58,542 --> 01:34:00,170
Now what will we stay here and do?

662
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:01,743
We'll do something.

663
01:34:08,752 --> 01:34:10,152
Getting engaged?

664
01:34:11,121 --> 01:34:15,524
Then you'll get married.
And you'll have children too.

665
01:34:16,426 --> 01:34:18,484
Then they too will get married.

666
01:34:18,728 --> 01:34:20,752
They too will have kids!

667
01:34:20,965 --> 01:34:24,161
One day you'll become
an old granny!

668
01:34:25,001 --> 01:34:28,801
And you'll have to see the
same man's face every morning!

669
01:34:37,979 --> 01:34:39,175
She's here!
Where are you going?

670
01:34:39,349 --> 01:34:41,078
Will you let me go
only after I tell you?

671
01:34:41,283 --> 01:34:44,515
Yes!
I'm going to meet the groom.u

672
01:34:44,854 --> 01:34:46,582
No! Not allowed!

673
01:34:47,689 --> 01:34:50,681
Do you know what
I'm called at home?

674
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:52,987
No.
Hitler!s

675
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:56,654
I'm going to come here
after marriage.

676
01:34:56,899 --> 01:35:01,131
If you don't keep me happy...

677
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:08,703
Where are you going?

678
01:35:08,877 --> 01:35:11,176
To meet the bridegroom.

679
01:35:11,381 --> 01:35:13,279
No mischief before marriage.

680
01:35:13,448 --> 01:35:16,578
I was going to tell him just that.

681
01:35:31,332 --> 01:35:33,198
What is it?
I saw nothing!

682
01:35:34,037 --> 01:35:36,368
What's the matter?
Something urgent.

683
01:35:36,573 --> 01:35:41,170
Go on.
I forgot.

684
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:50,681
I remember.
What is it?

685
01:35:50,987 --> 01:35:53,751
You'll be stuck after marriage.

686
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:57,393
If you want to change your mind...e

687
01:35:58,429 --> 01:36:00,225
Think about it.i

688
01:36:04,533 --> 01:36:06,832
Come soon. Guests have come.t

689
01:36:07,002 --> 01:36:09,470
Sure, I'm coming.
Must I come in the nude?

690
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,917
Don't bother him.
Who has come?

691
01:37:18,073 --> 01:37:22,340
Have I come at the wrong time?

692
01:37:26,448 --> 01:37:28,474
Why have you made them
stand outside the house.

693
01:37:28,652 --> 01:37:31,314
Bring them in, I say.

694
01:37:32,921 --> 01:37:34,912
Come in, child.

695
01:37:35,925 --> 01:37:39,154
We've been thrown out of
our rented accommodation.

696
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:41,956
We have no place to stay.

697
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:45,462
We can't even go back
to the village.

698
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,934
Sister's calling you.

699
01:37:49,104 --> 01:37:50,367
Go away.

700
01:37:55,011 --> 01:37:57,671
I can't understand where to go.

701
01:37:58,913 --> 01:38:01,747
Congratulations.h

702
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,819
Can I get a job? 

703
01:38:10,193 --> 01:38:11,786
Any kind of job.l

704
01:38:12,228 --> 01:38:15,823
I can do a bit of recording.

705
01:38:16,131 --> 01:38:20,796
I've also worked for radio.
I'll do any job in All India Radio.

706
01:38:21,636 --> 01:38:23,868
Even a temporary one.

707
01:38:24,506 --> 01:38:26,907
Preeti asks where's the groom;
Has he got cold feet?

708
01:38:27,077 --> 01:38:28,908
My son get scared?

709
01:38:29,212 --> 01:38:32,408
Mother, this is Meghna.
She'll stay upstairs.

710
01:38:32,613 --> 01:38:35,175
Have her luggage sent there.

711
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:38,810
Where do you work?

712
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:42,117
The wedding is on our heads
and you're inviting strangers...

713
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:44,487
I listened to you and
got ready for marriage.

714
01:38:44,661 --> 01:38:46,595
They're my friends. So what?

715
01:38:47,229 --> 01:38:49,198
She's coming!

716
01:39:01,845 --> 01:39:04,474
My grandson is getting married!

717
01:39:21,398 --> 01:39:24,729
Congratulations to you too.g

718
01:39:53,063 --> 01:39:55,622
Who is that girl?

719
01:39:59,804 --> 01:40:01,497
The one in red.

720
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:08,841
She's working with me
in all India radio...

721
01:40:09,078 --> 01:40:11,238
I just asked. Forget it.

722
01:40:12,782 --> 01:40:14,908
This is your room.

723
01:40:18,654 --> 01:40:21,420
Come in. I'll take it.

724
01:40:26,863 --> 01:40:28,728
This is...
My Papa.

725
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:30,363
This was his room.

726
01:40:30,533 --> 01:40:35,402
Is he in the army?
Was. He's no more.

727
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:37,702
May I leave?

728
01:40:40,277 --> 01:40:42,301
Wait for me. I'm coming!

729
01:40:46,282 --> 01:40:49,046
Edit it and show it to me.

730
01:40:53,823 --> 01:40:55,413
I'll come back in a minute.

731
01:41:03,233 --> 01:41:05,859
The certificates you'd asked for.

732
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:08,899
And my bio-data.

733
01:41:09,706 --> 01:41:11,332
The photocopy is with me.

734
01:41:12,475 --> 01:41:14,600
You desperately want this job.

735
01:41:16,947 --> 01:41:19,412
Then answer my questions.

736
01:41:23,618 --> 01:41:26,087
Why should I get you this job?

737
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:32,488
Why did you leave me?

738
01:41:34,063 --> 01:41:36,497
And why have you returned now?

739
01:41:43,805 --> 01:41:47,435
Will I get the job only
if I answer these questions?

740
01:41:56,886 --> 01:41:58,979
Forget it. Come back here.o

741
01:42:11,367 --> 01:42:14,804
What's the point in wanting
something not in your fate?

742
01:42:17,474 --> 01:42:20,636
There's no sympathy in your heart.

743
01:42:23,912 --> 01:42:26,939
Don't you love me?

744
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:31,783
I can't answer this...

745
01:42:41,331 --> 01:42:45,926
I've spoken to the ST.
You'll get a temporary job.

746
01:42:46,703 --> 01:42:50,537
Go out to the second room
on the left.

747
01:42:52,742 --> 01:42:54,710
Go on.

748
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:02,078
And listen... wipe your tears.

749
01:43:13,429 --> 01:43:16,261
It's a casual job.
Temporary broadcasts.

750
01:43:16,666 --> 01:43:18,895
Got the parade duty?
I'll get it.

751
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:23,902
Does Amar suspect anything?
No. He's very innocent.

752
01:43:24,105 --> 01:43:28,340
There's no suspicion in him.
What else is in him?

753
01:43:29,345 --> 01:43:31,210
And you?

754
01:43:33,814 --> 01:43:36,806
What's in you?

755
01:43:39,921 --> 01:43:41,114
Anger.o

756
01:43:41,858 --> 01:43:43,018
And? 

757
01:43:44,161 --> 01:43:47,152
Ideals. And?
My future.

758
01:43:47,363 --> 01:43:49,556
And?

759
01:43:50,899 --> 01:43:52,729
Courage.

760
01:43:55,002 --> 01:43:57,871
Have you forgotten
why you came here?

761
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:02,309
Do you remember what our people
have been through?

762
01:44:03,313 --> 01:44:05,143
I remember everything.

763
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:10,442
Love is into xicating.

764
01:44:10,653 --> 01:44:13,179
It's not made for us.

765
01:44:42,452 --> 01:44:43,680
Why don't you sing?

766
01:44:44,587 --> 01:44:47,920
You look so pretty when
you smile. Or you're glum.

767
01:44:49,192 --> 01:44:53,219
When I was 8, my smile left me.

768
01:44:53,462 --> 01:44:55,295
What's hidden in you?

769
01:44:56,765 --> 01:44:59,291
Nothing. Just unhappiness.

770
01:44:59,536 --> 01:45:02,162
Goodness me!
Not good to be so sad!

771
01:45:02,305 --> 01:45:04,706
Like Preeti, find
yourseld a good boy.

772
01:45:04,875 --> 01:45:07,036
We'll get you married too.

773
01:45:07,643 --> 01:45:09,702
What can I do if it's not fated?

774
01:45:09,912 --> 01:45:12,710
What fate? We carve our own fate!

775
01:45:14,684 --> 01:45:16,652
Welcome.

776
01:45:18,121 --> 01:45:20,145
Go and call Amar.

777
01:45:23,126 --> 01:45:26,787
He must be upstairs. Call him.g

778
01:45:55,893 --> 01:45:57,654
Suppose we get married.

779
01:45:57,859 --> 01:45:59,622
What do you think?

780
01:46:05,368 --> 01:46:07,734
Mummy is calling you.
Coming.

781
01:46:08,904 --> 01:46:11,875
But no fights
after the kids are born.

782
01:46:12,009 --> 01:46:14,703
They too will be
involved in our fights.

783
01:46:15,511 --> 01:46:16,806
Coming!

784
01:46:18,514 --> 01:46:21,210
One? Two?

785
01:46:22,417 --> 01:46:25,386
Three?
More.

786
01:46:26,488 --> 01:46:28,114
Eight? Had it!

787
01:46:28,422 --> 01:46:30,893
But the kids will be like me.

788
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:34,697
Eyes like mine.
Then keep them to yourself!

789
01:46:35,663 --> 01:46:37,326
Will they look like you?

790
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:40,296
This flat nose!
This flat nose?

791
01:46:41,037 --> 01:46:44,006
Didn't anyone ever tell you
only your smile is decent?

792
01:46:44,171 --> 01:46:47,609
Know what hitting like this means?

793
01:46:48,109 --> 01:46:52,136
You like me a lot.
Hitting like this means...

794
01:46:52,881 --> 01:46:54,712
You love me a lot.l

795
01:46:55,417 --> 01:46:58,649
This also means that
you can't live without me.

796
01:47:08,331 --> 01:47:10,354
Say yes just once.

797
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:15,134
We'll go far away from here.

798
01:47:16,505 --> 01:47:18,666
Say yes just once.

799
01:47:23,145 --> 01:47:24,805
They are calling you downstairs.

800
01:47:26,015 --> 01:47:30,009
Look at this. It's beautiful.

801
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:35,185
I've called Amar.

802
01:47:36,826 --> 01:47:38,657
Come here, child.

803
01:47:43,634 --> 01:47:45,395
I'll call Preeti.

804
01:47:45,568 --> 01:47:47,832
Who knows where she must be.

805
01:47:48,002 --> 01:47:51,564
Try it on.
How will we know otherwise?

806
01:47:55,045 --> 01:47:56,908
Bring the mirror.

807
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:05,243
She looks just like a bride.

808
01:48:05,421 --> 01:48:09,050
Tell us if you have a groom
in mind, we'll get you married!

809
01:48:11,493 --> 01:48:13,394
How are they? 

810
01:48:27,243 --> 01:48:31,907
It's a marching tune on the tuba.

811
01:48:32,581 --> 01:48:36,538
Did anyone buy a tuba
from you very recently?

812
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:40,484
Yes. Who wants to know?

813
01:48:44,327 --> 01:48:47,126
Who was he?
An old man.

814
01:48:47,296 --> 01:48:51,028
He came a few days ago.

815
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:53,965
Here's his address.
Near Jama Masjid.

816
01:49:03,813 --> 01:49:05,212
Quick!d

817
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:11,447
To the back lane!

818
01:49:12,287 --> 01:49:14,551
Search every house.

819
01:49:19,362 --> 01:49:20,921
Sir, they've escaped.

820
01:49:23,233 --> 01:49:24,663
No!

821
01:50:00,403 --> 01:50:01,993
There's a call for you.

822
01:50:12,148 --> 01:50:14,341
May I come in?
Yes.

823
01:50:31,268 --> 01:50:33,326
I am frightened.

824
01:50:36,005 --> 01:50:39,997
I'm getting married.
So far, I was happy.

825
01:50:40,309 --> 01:50:44,006
But as the day draws close
I feel...

826
01:50:45,715 --> 01:50:47,546
Will I be trapped?

827
01:50:48,984 --> 01:50:50,917
Everything will be fine.

828
01:50:51,188 --> 01:50:53,779
Really?
Yes.

829
01:50:54,988 --> 01:50:56,890
Amar and you...

830
01:50:58,028 --> 01:51:01,462
You'll be happy.
Are you sure?

831
01:51:04,166 --> 01:51:05,792
You are responsible.

832
01:51:06,036 --> 01:51:08,662
If anything goes wrong,
I'll question you.

833
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:12,001
Be informal.

834
01:51:13,542 --> 01:51:19,344
Stay with me till the wedding.

835
01:51:35,363 --> 01:51:36,761
Sensible girl.

836
01:51:37,332 --> 01:51:40,166
Tied you to her apron
and slipped away.

837
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:52,538
What about the recording?

838
01:51:52,814 --> 01:51:56,216
How is your leg?
And did you find the dog?

839
01:51:56,519 --> 01:51:58,750
The recording?
In a while.

840
01:51:59,054 --> 01:52:02,216
Kids wait for so long?
I'll just arrange it.

841
01:52:02,492 --> 01:52:04,890
Need a wheelchair?
Definitely not!

842
01:52:09,296 --> 01:52:11,323
Watch where you go.

843
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:15,268
It will be done in half an hour.

844
01:52:16,037 --> 01:52:18,563
In half an hour.

845
01:52:22,243 --> 01:52:23,836
How come you dropped by suddenly?

846
01:52:24,078 --> 01:52:27,515
My second wife's mother
has passed away.

847
01:52:27,751 --> 01:52:30,947
I fought and got myself transferred.

848
01:52:31,252 --> 01:52:36,590
I brought my 2 wives, kids and the
leftover mother-in-law and came here.

849
01:52:37,926 --> 01:52:39,554
Heard you're getting married.

850
01:52:39,728 --> 01:52:44,095
Checked everything?
Now you'll understand my problem.

851
01:52:52,375 --> 01:52:53,966
Good day.
Good day.

852
01:52:54,975 --> 01:52:57,412
Send this with the
tape to Bangalore?a

853
01:53:03,819 --> 01:53:05,787
How did she come here?

854
01:53:07,323 --> 01:53:08,788
No, it's not so.

855
01:53:08,957 --> 01:53:11,894
It's not what you think it is.

856
01:53:12,094 --> 01:53:16,895
Getting married but keep
your beloved in your arms.

857
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:20,328
You're also giving her a job!

858
01:53:21,103 --> 01:53:23,902
And she stays in our out house.

859
01:53:24,139 --> 01:53:26,505
What? In your house?

860
01:53:26,942 --> 01:53:28,876
May you go to hell! You...

861
01:53:29,045 --> 01:53:31,069
If you've spoken your bit,
may I speak? Yes.

862
01:53:32,546 --> 01:53:35,143
I don't know why she left me.

863
01:53:37,353 --> 01:53:39,582
I don't even know why she returned.

864
01:53:39,755 --> 01:53:42,554
But I know it's not for me.

865
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:47,225
I want to find out why.

866
01:53:47,429 --> 01:53:49,988
Now may I speak?

867
01:53:52,801 --> 01:53:55,770
Yes.
Throw her out immediately!

868
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:57,996
I can't do it.

869
01:53:58,207 --> 01:54:01,404
I can't do it.
Why not?

870
01:54:01,975 --> 01:54:04,774
Because I can't do it!

871
01:54:07,483 --> 01:54:09,279
Then do one thing.

872
01:54:09,451 --> 01:54:11,247
Leave either one of them.

873
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:15,912
Don't ride 2 boats
or you'll drown!

874
01:54:16,425 --> 01:54:18,551
Learn from my experience!

875
01:54:18,725 --> 01:54:21,457
Think it over and tell one of them.

876
01:58:41,957 --> 01:58:43,720
What will happen to them?

877
01:58:44,725 --> 01:58:49,060
Because of us,
they will be ruined.

878
01:58:51,867 --> 01:58:54,335
They are not bad people.

879
01:58:55,572 --> 01:58:57,265
What wrong have they done?

880
01:58:59,908 --> 01:59:02,274
Their lives will be ruined!

881
01:59:03,278 --> 01:59:05,712
They trusted us.o

882
01:59:06,314 --> 01:59:08,783
Gave us shelter.

883
01:59:12,421 --> 01:59:15,447
Is what we're doing right?

884
01:59:16,957 --> 01:59:19,984
The innocent will be killed.

885
01:59:21,462 --> 01:59:24,626
Don't you ever doubt yourself?

886
01:59:33,841 --> 01:59:36,470
There is one aim to our revolution.

887
01:59:36,877 --> 01:59:39,573
There is one aim to our revolution.

888
01:59:39,814 --> 01:59:42,305
Independence for our country.

889
01:59:43,118 --> 01:59:45,586
We'll sacrifice everything for it.

890
01:59:46,622 --> 01:59:51,922
We sacrifice our bodies for it.

891
01:59:52,859 --> 01:59:56,319
Our dreams. Our souls.

892
01:59:57,532 --> 02:00:00,023
And impartially accept...

893
02:00:01,103 --> 02:00:03,197
...our commander...

894
02:00:04,072 --> 02:00:06,095
And every command of his.

895
02:00:06,942 --> 02:00:10,104
For the progress of our revolution.

896
02:00:10,377 --> 02:00:12,676
We'll sacrifice ourselves.

897
02:00:14,617 --> 02:00:16,845
We hereby swear.

898
02:00:26,595 --> 02:00:27,858
How many were they?

899
02:00:28,095 --> 02:00:32,395
About 3 men and 2 women.

900
02:00:33,001 --> 02:00:35,162
How were they?
What do you mean?

901
02:00:35,404 --> 02:00:39,238
From where were they?
Bengal, Assam?

902
02:00:40,542 --> 02:00:41,734
That I don't know.

903
02:00:43,944 --> 02:00:47,176
What's this picture of an army
vehicle doing in your studio?

904
02:00:47,381 --> 02:00:49,872
A customer asked me to make a copy.

905
02:00:50,484 --> 02:00:53,546
Why?
That's his business.

906
02:00:54,555 --> 02:00:57,389
I won't give it!
It's mine!

907
02:01:03,631 --> 02:01:05,564
She's talking to a man!

908
02:01:09,604 --> 02:01:11,162
You're quietly listening!

909
02:01:11,805 --> 02:01:13,466
If grandma hears...?

910
02:01:13,707 --> 02:01:16,974
She's talking to her boyfriend!r

911
02:01:17,612 --> 02:01:20,511
They have to meet at night.

912
02:01:33,962 --> 02:01:35,657
Please be seated.

913
02:01:38,501 --> 02:01:39,694
Yes?

914
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:42,934
I've seen this man.

915
02:01:43,505 --> 02:01:45,131
This was published some days ago.

916
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:48,867
I saw him just yesterday.
Him?

917
02:01:52,514 --> 02:01:55,143
No, the one who was chasing him.

918
02:01:55,484 --> 02:01:59,944
You know him?
I broke my leg thanks to him!

919
02:02:00,488 --> 02:02:04,118
My dog almost died!

920
02:02:13,135 --> 02:02:16,332
My father always said...

921
02:02:22,144 --> 02:02:23,439
Who is this man?

922
02:02:24,645 --> 02:02:25,671
I don't know.

923
02:02:25,947 --> 02:02:28,881
What's his name?
I don't know.

924
02:02:29,117 --> 02:02:31,210
Don't lie. The lie
detector is connected.

925
02:02:31,453 --> 02:02:34,716
Who are you?,

926
02:02:37,658 --> 02:02:42,528
Who are you? And in what
capacity are you asking me this?

927
02:02:45,233 --> 02:02:47,827
How many others in your group?

928
02:02:48,037 --> 02:02:50,733
I don't belong to any group.

929
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:56,104
I told you I work for
All India Radio.

930
02:02:57,813 --> 02:02:59,609
I know nothing else.

931
02:02:59,814 --> 02:03:01,510
You can't leave this room.

932
02:03:01,751 --> 02:03:05,082
Please don't threaten me.
I'm also a government servant.

933
02:03:06,322 --> 02:03:08,015
My father was in the Indian army.

934
02:03:08,288 --> 02:03:11,817
And my grandfather fought in
the freedom struggle in IN A.

935
02:03:12,961 --> 02:03:15,725
And I too am worried for India.

936
02:03:16,029 --> 02:03:19,126
Who is he? Where does he live?

937
02:03:20,202 --> 02:03:23,431
Where has he come from?
Why does he stay here?

938
02:03:23,904 --> 02:03:27,395
I know nothing.
Then why were you chasing him?

939
02:03:29,310 --> 02:03:32,212
Because if somebody abuses,
beats you and then runs away...

940
02:03:32,447 --> 02:03:33,880
Won't you follow him?

941
02:03:34,216 --> 02:03:36,341
Why did he abuse you?

942
02:03:37,618 --> 02:03:40,520
I don't know. Go and ask him.

943
02:03:40,755 --> 02:03:42,381
He abused me! Hit me!

944
02:03:42,625 --> 02:03:44,353
And you don't say anything
to him instead catch me!

945
02:03:44,626 --> 02:03:47,457
I am extremely sorry.

946
02:03:48,331 --> 02:03:51,662
I had called you to talk
about your station director.

947
02:03:51,931 --> 02:03:57,769
It's our job. We have to do it.

948
02:04:06,113 --> 02:04:08,810
I don't need to wait...?

949
02:04:09,082 --> 02:04:11,144
Definitely not. See him out.

950
02:05:37,404 --> 02:05:38,872
Did you see Meghna?

951
02:05:39,073 --> 02:05:41,064
The new fair girl with small eyes.

952
02:05:41,376 --> 02:05:44,104
Who stays with me?
She came, smiled a bit.

953
02:05:44,412 --> 02:05:45,903
Shukla took her with him.

954
02:05:46,215 --> 02:05:47,680
Parade rehearsal?
Of course.

955
02:05:51,019 --> 02:05:52,484
Drive faster.

956
02:05:53,456 --> 02:05:55,889
Take another cab if
you're in such a rush.

957
02:06:12,073 --> 02:06:14,131
I have this pass. Drive on.

958
02:06:14,376 --> 02:06:16,867
They will still create a scene.
They do it everyday.

959
02:06:17,979 --> 02:06:19,844
You'll have to drive around.
Come on.

960
02:06:39,868 --> 02:06:42,359
Didn't I tell you?
I know!

961
02:06:43,371 --> 02:06:45,862
Where are you taking the car?
I know sir.

962
02:06:46,108 --> 02:06:49,599
Can I go from ahead?
Yes, that way.

963
02:06:51,179 --> 02:06:54,206
They always do their work well.

964
02:06:54,849 --> 02:06:57,375
And trouble the citizens.
Turn right.

965
02:06:58,287 --> 02:07:01,551
I hope you're not a terrorist.

966
02:07:02,224 --> 02:07:05,317
Drive fast!
This is wonderful!

967
02:07:40,929 --> 02:07:45,559
I've left in a rush.
I thought you...

968
02:07:46,067 --> 02:07:48,296
Where are you going? Come here.

969
02:08:04,685 --> 02:08:06,051
Who are you?

970
02:08:09,524 --> 02:08:12,252
Who are you and why
have you come here?

971
02:08:13,228 --> 02:08:14,854
Don't tell me any more lies!

972
02:08:15,063 --> 02:08:17,327
I'm fed up of your lies!

973
02:08:20,702 --> 02:08:22,930
Why did that boy
run away on seeing me?

974
02:08:24,706 --> 02:08:26,970
Was it a co-incidence
that I saw him?

975
02:08:27,175 --> 02:08:30,167
Tell me the truth.
He is dead

976
02:08:33,148 --> 02:08:36,277
You came home and
didn't ask for any job.

977
02:08:36,484 --> 02:08:39,578
Why did you ask for a job
in All India radio?

978
02:08:41,256 --> 02:08:43,622
I chased you like a madman.

979
02:08:44,894 --> 02:08:48,125
And you used me!

980
02:08:53,332 --> 02:08:56,099
Why did you do this?
Why are you doing this?

981
02:08:56,938 --> 02:08:58,599
So much of hatred?

982
02:08:59,207 --> 02:09:01,140
Such bestiality!

983
02:09:03,179 --> 02:09:05,975
Would your parents approve?

984
02:09:08,015 --> 02:09:10,951
You talked of difficulty.

985
02:09:12,054 --> 02:09:16,353
You talked of your
mother's palms in the temple.

986
02:09:18,158 --> 02:09:19,751
And what do you do?

987
02:09:20,328 --> 02:09:23,764
Make bombs! Kill people!n

988
02:09:23,997 --> 02:09:26,728
The kind of life I've lived...

989
02:09:27,734 --> 02:09:31,694
...you haven't seen what I have.

990
02:09:34,108 --> 02:09:37,372
You sit in Delhi and
play songs on the radio.

991
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:43,640
What do you know of our
difficulties for the past 50 years?

992
02:09:45,688 --> 02:09:48,679
We're being deceived
for 50 years!

993
02:09:50,323 --> 02:09:52,350
When we ask questions,
we are silenced.

994
02:09:54,529 --> 02:09:57,590
You know nothing!

995
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:02,537
What do you know?

996
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:07,970
You feel the revolution has grown
but you're not to be blamed!

997
02:10:08,777 --> 02:10:11,974
Lives are being taken
and you have no hand in it?

998
02:10:15,617 --> 02:10:17,983
The way we live...

999
02:10:19,854 --> 02:10:23,085
We have no other alternative.

1000
02:10:24,826 --> 02:10:27,555
Dad! Dad!

1001
02:10:28,529 --> 02:10:31,122
Death at every footstep.

1002
02:10:32,899 --> 02:10:35,960
Day and night. Every moment.

1003
02:10:37,805 --> 02:10:40,273
They kept killing us!

1004
02:10:40,806 --> 02:10:42,832
We kept shedding our blood!

1005
02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:46,408
There was blood everywhere!

1006
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:51,675
Screams of people still
echo in my ears! Stop it!

1007
02:11:06,033 --> 02:11:09,697
Sister!
Do you know it?

1008
02:11:28,456 --> 02:11:32,358
Sister! Leave her!

1009
02:11:33,127 --> 02:11:35,595
Run away!

1010
02:11:36,595 --> 02:11:40,295
Little one run away!

1011
02:11:40,536 --> 02:11:43,832
Leave her!

1012
02:12:24,278 --> 02:12:27,042
Have you ever smelt death?

1013
02:12:29,216 --> 02:12:34,849
We pledge our bodies and souls...

1014
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:39,457
With impartiality... 

1015
02:12:40,694 --> 02:12:43,358
Every child has the
same story to tell.

1016
02:12:44,131 --> 02:12:48,363
Maybe worse than mine.

1017
02:13:10,323 --> 02:13:13,314
I'll give up everything.

1018
02:13:13,993 --> 02:13:18,658
My family, job... everything.

1019
02:13:22,671 --> 02:13:25,264
Come with me.

1020
02:13:29,144 --> 02:13:32,703
Forget all this
ever happened to you.

1021
02:13:33,747 --> 02:13:35,978
We'll go away from here.

1022
02:13:36,652 --> 02:13:38,448
We'll run away. 

1023
02:13:45,426 --> 02:13:47,326
Won't you do this?

1024
02:13:49,029 --> 02:13:51,658
I can't do it.

1025
02:13:57,805 --> 02:13:59,395
So terrorism...

1026
02:14:00,942 --> 02:14:02,773
Now what do you want to do?

1027
02:14:04,212 --> 02:14:06,578
How many do you want to slay?

1028
02:14:07,314 --> 02:14:10,148
Come, I'll accompany you.

1029
02:14:10,751 --> 02:14:13,015
We'll kill people together!

1030
02:14:15,256 --> 02:14:17,087
You still don't understand.

1031
02:14:18,559 --> 02:14:22,323
I can understand what
must have happened.

1032
02:14:23,162 --> 02:14:25,654
But I can't understand
what is going to happen.

1033
02:14:25,966 --> 02:14:27,434
How many will you kill?

1034
02:14:27,769 --> 02:14:29,201
- 20, 30, 50?

1035
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:31,863
Will this ease the
suffering of your state?

1036
02:14:32,073 --> 02:14:34,099
Will happiness return?

1037
02:14:34,675 --> 02:14:36,698
I know what you went
through was wrong.

1038
02:14:36,944 --> 02:14:39,572
But because of the
mistakes of some...

1039
02:14:39,779 --> 02:14:41,747
...you can't take it out
on the whole country.

1040
02:14:41,948 --> 02:14:45,350
A few peoples' mistakes?
What are these mistakes?

1041
02:14:46,252 --> 02:14:48,085
Killing innocent people?

1042
02:14:49,154 --> 02:14:50,817
Or setting entire villages aflame?

1043
02:14:54,261 --> 02:14:56,890
Raping a 12 year old child!

1044
02:14:59,867 --> 02:15:04,667
If you can't answer our struggle...

1045
02:15:05,072 --> 02:15:07,063
If you can't give us justice...

1046
02:15:07,274 --> 02:15:09,300
Is it a crime to ask for justice?

1047
02:15:10,877 --> 02:15:14,109
Little kids wield guns and
their parents don't stop them...

1048
02:15:14,448 --> 02:15:19,886
Why? Because it makes no
difference even if they die!

1049
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,921
There's no other way of survival.

1050
02:15:23,189 --> 02:15:25,680
Your army is your protection.

1051
02:15:25,926 --> 02:15:28,520
Quiet! I know the army well!

1052
02:15:28,697 --> 02:15:31,130
You would have fought
each other to death!

1053
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:33,488
Each little village
fighting against the other!

1054
02:15:33,701 --> 02:15:36,033
Had it not been for the army, this
nation would be torn to shreds!

1055
02:15:36,237 --> 02:15:37,966
You think the army helps us?

1056
02:15:38,206 --> 02:15:40,069
Who else will save you?
Your terrorists?

1057
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:42,336
Will you protect your
nation with terrorism?

1058
02:15:42,710 --> 02:15:45,144
Your nation not mine.
What will you do?

1059
02:15:45,912 --> 02:15:48,474
Will you kill people or
blow the country with a bomb?

1060
02:15:49,384 --> 02:15:51,613
You will celebrate the joy
of 50 years of independence.

1061
02:15:51,819 --> 02:15:55,345
And the world will watch
how we've been oppressed.

1062
02:15:55,622 --> 02:15:59,457
- 50 years...?

1063
02:16:01,296 --> 02:16:06,788
What are you going to do?

1064
02:16:07,201 --> 02:16:12,162
What are you going to do?

1065
02:16:14,675 --> 02:16:17,667
You used me...
Yes!

1066
02:16:18,779 --> 02:16:20,804
What do you mean to me? Nothing!

1067
02:16:21,082 --> 02:16:24,849
What your heart says, what you think
your marriage, family, children...

1068
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:27,818
They hold no meaning for me!

1069
02:16:28,021 --> 02:16:29,988
Tell me what you're going to do!

1070
02:16:30,992 --> 02:16:33,985
What?
What will you do?

1071
02:16:34,227 --> 02:16:37,218
What is this?
Don't touch me!

1072
02:16:37,832 --> 02:16:41,200
Leave me!
What are you wearing?

1073
02:16:41,403 --> 02:16:43,630
What are you wearing?

1074
02:16:44,039 --> 02:16:46,269
Tell me what this is!

1075
02:16:47,308 --> 02:16:50,139
Let me go!

1076
02:16:55,316 --> 02:16:58,112
Teasing a girl! Rascal!
You may go, madam.

1077
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:08,091
Sit inside. I'll show you!

1078
02:17:22,010 --> 02:17:25,238
Three men and two women.

1079
02:17:29,549 --> 02:17:36,217
They seem to be using old trucks.

1080
02:17:36,755 --> 02:17:39,090
We have found the chassis
and engine number of the trucks.

1081
02:17:39,692 --> 02:17:45,155
To remove suspicion from that
spot they used 555 timer...

1082
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:47,467
...along with RDX.

1083
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:50,296
What does all this mean?

1084
02:17:52,871 --> 02:17:55,066
Sir, January 26...

1085
02:17:58,546 --> 02:17:59,977
Hang on!

1086
02:18:02,316 --> 02:18:03,545
Amar here.

1087
02:18:03,782 --> 02:18:05,581
You called at the right time.

1088
02:18:05,818 --> 02:18:09,654
I was bathing, I'm wet...
Listen to me.

1089
02:18:10,092 --> 02:18:12,683
No, you listen!
I'm wearing only a bathrobe!

1090
02:18:12,894 --> 02:18:14,620
Listen, this is very urgent!

1091
02:18:14,930 --> 02:18:17,522
Of love or...
Don't talk nonsense!

1092
02:18:17,996 --> 02:18:23,093
Meeta and Meghna
who are staying with us...

1093
02:18:23,870 --> 02:18:25,700
If they return don't
let them leave.

1094
02:18:26,173 --> 02:18:27,868
This boy is our brother.

1095
02:18:28,110 --> 02:18:30,371
If you suppress this matter...

1096
02:18:30,809 --> 02:18:32,834
He hit a constable!
I know.

1097
02:18:33,647 --> 02:18:36,138
But everything is in your hands.
No!

1098
02:18:36,384 --> 02:18:38,510
It concerns a woman!

1099
02:18:41,388 --> 02:18:43,218
Yes, I'm fine.
I'll explain when I return.

1100
02:18:43,492 --> 02:18:46,359
Let me talk...
Bail paid.

1101
02:18:47,128 --> 02:18:50,120
Now if you slap a policeman
I'll lock you up! Go away!

1102
02:18:51,332 --> 02:18:53,233
Somebody teach him manners.

1103
02:19:02,010 --> 02:19:04,237
Sit quietly.
Keep it away.

1104
02:19:11,718 --> 02:19:14,985
We want to search your house...
talk to your son.

1105
02:19:15,388 --> 02:19:17,153
Your information is wrong.
This is impossible.

1106
02:19:17,325 --> 02:19:19,620
We have enough proof.

1107
02:19:19,825 --> 02:19:23,456
My son is an army officer's son!

1108
02:19:27,066 --> 02:19:29,536
Some people were staying here.
Where are they now?

1109
02:19:29,835 --> 02:19:32,601
They were Meghna and Meeta,
friends of Amar.

1110
02:19:33,005 --> 02:19:34,996
Where are they?
They were around.

1111
02:19:40,979 --> 02:19:43,575
And Amar?
There's a wedding in 4 days.

1112
02:19:43,782 --> 02:19:46,808
There are hundreds of jobs.
Clothes, jewellery, food...

1113
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,182
Must be doing something.
Why did Meghna and Meeta leave?

1114
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:57,956
If you have any letter or
newspaper or anything at all...

1115
02:19:58,466 --> 02:20:01,023
Or any phone call that they
made or received over here.

1116
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:04,192
Give me anything of theirs
that you have or remember.

1117
02:20:04,405 --> 02:20:06,966
It would be a service
to the nation.

1118
02:20:07,174 --> 02:20:11,700
If I find out my son is a terrorist
I'll call you myself to arrest him!

1119
02:20:18,050 --> 02:20:19,075
What's going on?
Where are they taking her?

1120
02:20:19,352 --> 02:20:21,082
Take care of everyone.

1121
02:20:24,022 --> 02:20:25,082
Keep walking quietly.

1122
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:26,952
One word and you'll drop dead!

1123
02:20:29,797 --> 02:20:31,593
You can't get away...

1124
02:20:35,369 --> 02:20:38,461
The CBI knows everything.
They must be behind right now.

1125
02:20:39,673 --> 02:20:41,368
Where are you taking me?

1126
02:20:52,084 --> 02:20:55,921
Come to the police station.
I'll show you.

1127
02:20:56,724 --> 02:20:58,885
Imbecile!
My sweet...

1128
02:20:59,093 --> 02:21:00,888
Flirting with a girl!

1129
02:21:01,663 --> 02:21:04,188
Impressing a girl!

1130
02:21:05,566 --> 02:21:07,501
You...!

1131
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:11,501
I won't leave him!

1132
02:21:12,474 --> 02:21:15,201
I'll lock you up!

1133
02:21:19,111 --> 02:21:21,102
Move behind!

1134
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:23,942
Hit me, will you!

1135
02:22:20,875 --> 02:22:25,278
Hit me? Now hit me!

1136
02:23:02,014 --> 02:23:03,675
Let go!

1137
02:24:27,502 --> 02:24:29,492
Who is it?

1138
02:24:30,938 --> 02:24:33,634
Muster up courage and come to me.

1139
02:24:34,272 --> 02:24:35,864
Are you hurt?

1140
02:24:36,777 --> 02:24:38,143
I am not dead.

1141
02:24:38,913 --> 02:24:41,108
And I won't die...

1142
02:24:42,183 --> 02:24:44,343
Till I find you.

1143
02:24:45,253 --> 02:24:46,914
Please come to me.

1144
02:24:49,254 --> 02:24:51,190
Where are you?

1145
02:24:53,727 --> 02:24:56,193
You can't come here.
You're my life.

1146
02:24:57,165 --> 02:24:59,029
Try to understand.

1147
02:24:59,968 --> 02:25:04,529
Don't you feel our love is
more important than terrorism?

1148
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:08,307
I'm too far gone... it's too late.

1149
02:25:08,509 --> 02:25:10,907
I won't let you go.

1150
02:25:11,810 --> 02:25:14,474
I won't let you go.
It's not too late.

1151
02:25:24,058 --> 02:25:27,924
What are you doing?

1152
02:25:30,698 --> 02:25:33,129
Don't shoot!

1153
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:55,521
I need permission sir.

1154
02:25:55,987 --> 02:25:58,183
All the army cars used in the
parade are to be checked.

1155
02:25:58,523 --> 02:26:00,754
What are you saying?
I even want to check the tanks.

1156
02:26:00,959 --> 02:26:04,090
That will salute the President.
This is not a fair demand.

1157
02:26:04,496 --> 02:26:06,862
Sir listen to me.

1158
02:26:07,268 --> 02:26:11,066
We've already lost a Prime Minister
because of the body guards.

1159
02:26:11,573 --> 02:26:13,470
Security never harmed anyone.

1160
02:26:13,906 --> 02:26:15,842
This parade has been
going on for years.

1161
02:26:16,575 --> 02:26:18,636
What do you think of yourself!

1162
02:26:19,012 --> 02:26:21,573
All the security units be revamped.

1163
02:26:21,781 --> 02:26:24,911
This remain secret till the morning
of January 26, nobody must know...

1164
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:28,384
Who is in charge of which gate...

1165
02:26:30,825 --> 02:26:34,022
Can this be done, General?

1166
02:26:37,798 --> 02:26:39,629
Yes, sir. It will be done.

1167
02:27:04,022 --> 02:27:05,788
What happened to you?

1168
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:14,030
I have to find Meghna.

1169
02:27:14,566 --> 02:27:17,129
I have to stop this.
Why don't you understand?

1170
02:27:17,904 --> 02:27:19,736
It is beyond us.

1171
02:27:20,739 --> 02:27:23,174
The CBI considers you a terrorist.

1172
02:27:23,477 --> 02:27:26,038
They've taken mother for inquiry.
Mother...?

1173
02:27:26,478 --> 02:27:30,280
Please give this up.
I have to find Meghna.

1174
02:27:31,084 --> 02:27:32,915
I have to stop her before morning.

1175
02:27:34,586 --> 02:27:37,717
You can't forget her, isn't it?

1176
02:27:38,893 --> 02:27:40,755
She will listen to me.

1177
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:43,621
She won't do anything if
she sees me. I can stop her.

1178
02:27:44,229 --> 02:27:48,361
Then why have you come here?
You should've gone to Sundernagar!

1179
02:27:49,834 --> 02:27:51,771
What do I do about
these wedding cards?

1180
02:27:52,103 --> 02:27:53,299
Should I write Meghna's name
next to yours?

1181
02:27:53,505 --> 02:27:55,666
What about Sundernagar?
Why should I tell you?

1182
02:27:55,843 --> 02:27:59,369
I don't know there's some
place behind the bus stand!

1183
02:27:59,577 --> 02:28:01,943
So? Who told you about this?

1184
02:28:02,113 --> 02:28:05,344
The children and I overheard
on the phone. Happy?

1185
02:28:08,556 --> 02:28:09,986
Now answer my question.

1186
02:28:10,190 --> 02:28:12,351
What do I do about these?

1187
02:28:13,558 --> 02:28:15,790
Search him!

1188
02:28:18,897 --> 02:28:22,199
Who are you? What are you doing?

1189
02:28:22,701 --> 02:28:24,862
He's not a terrorist!

1190
02:28:27,739 --> 02:28:30,904
What will happen tomorrow?

1191
02:28:31,076 --> 02:28:34,739
I'm not one of them.
I don't know if they make bombs.

1192
02:28:34,979 --> 02:28:37,540
Where are the explosives?
I'm not one of them!

1193
02:28:37,752 --> 02:28:39,979
You gave them shelter.

1194
02:28:40,153 --> 02:28:42,120
Did you keep her in your house?
Yes or no?

1195
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:44,655
Yes, she had no place to stay.

1196
02:28:44,859 --> 02:28:46,721
Did you get her a job?

1197
02:28:46,925 --> 02:28:49,556
Yes I did! Because I love her!

1198
02:28:49,828 --> 02:28:51,728
We accept that.
Now listen to what I say!

1199
02:28:51,863 --> 02:28:54,629
Did you meet terrorists
in north-east?

1200
02:28:54,834 --> 02:28:57,030
Yes, I did. But that's my job!

1201
02:28:57,236 --> 02:28:58,727
Interviewing them is your job?

1202
02:28:59,172 --> 02:29:01,604
Hold him.
I'm telling you, sir!

1203
02:29:01,876 --> 02:29:04,103
What are you doing?
All will be well in 24 hours.

1204
02:29:04,277 --> 02:29:06,540
You'll sleep for 24 hours.
I don't have 24 hours!

1205
02:29:06,813 --> 02:29:09,441
And we'll get the truth out of you!

1206
02:29:10,851 --> 02:29:18,585
What is going to happen?

1207
02:29:25,599 --> 02:29:29,296
How many people do they have?

1208
02:29:29,567 --> 02:29:31,398
What is their plan?

1209
02:29:34,239 --> 02:29:37,174
Keep shaking him awake and
ask questions every half an hour.

1210
02:29:38,779 --> 02:29:41,647
Call me up on the wireless
as soon as you get an answer.

1211
02:29:42,216 --> 02:29:45,673
- 2 men in the corridor
and 2 men in the room.

1212
02:29:46,887 --> 02:29:47,977
Yes, sir.

1213
02:29:53,361 --> 02:29:55,056
Where has he gone?

1214
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:58,221
You search here.
I'll take a look down there.

1215
02:30:03,403 --> 02:30:06,031
- 7 tomorrow morning...
The military van will be in place.

1216
02:30:06,272 --> 02:30:09,072
- 7. 15...
Jeep in position with remote.

1217
02:30:10,243 --> 02:30:13,111
I'll be at the block
security post by 8.45.

1218
02:30:13,814 --> 02:30:18,752
- 9. 15... I'll enter with the
dancers by the security gate block.

1219
02:30:19,886 --> 02:30:22,013
Here's my security card.

1220
02:30:22,353 --> 02:30:24,344
If Meghna makes a mistake
I'll be prepared.

1221
02:30:24,759 --> 02:30:25,986
- 9.30?

1222
02:30:27,494 --> 02:30:29,290
I'll be ready.

1223
02:30:30,228 --> 02:30:31,754
- 9.45...

1224
02:30:32,263 --> 02:30:34,165
Everyone will be in position.

1225
02:30:35,166 --> 02:30:37,566
The President will take
his position at 9.58.

1226
02:30:38,138 --> 02:30:39,763
The parade will begin at 10

1227
02:30:44,912 --> 02:30:47,073
At 10.40...?

1228
02:30:47,846 --> 02:30:49,871
The dancers pass before the stage.

1229
02:30:52,584 --> 02:30:54,179
- 10.42...?

1230
02:30:54,452 --> 02:30:56,422
The wires of the sound
system will be snapped.

1231
02:31:01,727 --> 02:31:05,184
In this confusion, I'll reach the
stage with my all India radio pass.

1232
02:31:12,638 --> 02:31:15,040
I'll be before the television camera.

1233
02:31:15,273 --> 02:31:18,768
Independence of our state.

1234
02:31:49,743 --> 02:31:51,675
Don't fall asleep!

1235
02:31:59,183 --> 02:32:00,915
Stop!

1236
02:32:13,467 --> 02:32:16,433
Stay awake!

1237
02:32:17,969 --> 02:32:19,165
Get up!

1238
02:32:50,435 --> 02:32:53,600
Don't fall asleep...

1239
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:10,010
What are you watching?
My last morning.

1240
02:34:11,218 --> 02:34:13,152
Are you frightened?

1241
02:34:13,653 --> 02:34:15,846
Not since last night.

1242
02:34:18,359 --> 02:34:20,384
You're looking beautiful.

1243
02:34:21,027 --> 02:34:25,792
Do you know why? Because nobody
is more beautiful than a martyr.

1244
02:34:28,368 --> 02:34:33,601
It's not essential that you
take birth in a better society.

1245
02:34:35,208 --> 02:34:40,542
But it's essential that you
give others a better society.

1246
02:36:04,465 --> 02:36:05,795
Who are you?

1247
02:36:06,264 --> 02:36:08,790
What are you doing in this van?

1248
02:36:19,477 --> 02:36:21,138
Where is Meghna?

1249
02:36:31,255 --> 02:36:33,556
Where is Meghna?

1250
02:36:38,298 --> 02:36:40,733
Where is she?

1251
02:38:31,611 --> 02:38:33,341
Don't come forward.

1252
02:38:34,578 --> 02:38:35,977
Why?

1253
02:38:49,827 --> 02:38:51,727
Don't come close to me.

1254
02:38:52,466 --> 02:38:56,902
I once said, I'd never leave you.

1255
02:39:00,841 --> 02:39:01,933
I have come.

1256
02:39:16,155 --> 02:39:17,884
This is the truth.

1257
02:39:20,027 --> 02:39:21,584
Don't touch me!

1258
02:39:27,299 --> 02:39:30,236
Don't come with me
if you don't want to.

1259
02:39:32,470 --> 02:39:34,335
Take me with you.

1260
02:39:38,611 --> 02:39:40,545
Take me along.

1261
02:39:56,295 --> 02:39:58,558
Take me along.

1262
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:06,965
Take me too along.

1263
02:40:12,879 --> 02:40:15,370
You love me.

1264
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:20,943
Just once say that you love me.

1265
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:27,486
Just once say that you love me.

1266
02:40:34,867 --> 02:40:38,564
Say it just once!
