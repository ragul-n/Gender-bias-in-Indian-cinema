1
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:01,088
Kabir, let's leave!

2
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,255
<i>Kabir, say a prayer before you leave.</i>

3
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:28,422
Let's get moving!

4
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:34,255
Kabir, our video has crossed
a million views.

5
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:36,713
Let him be, Tony.

6
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:57,088
Kabir is a bit silent, isn't he?

7
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:58,338
He's angry.

8
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,213
Why?

9
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:04,130
Because he lost his mother,
and now his home.

10
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:06,672
He's angry about moving to Old Delhi.

11
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:43,088
Titu, your scooter!

12
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:45,588
Asshole, wearing blinkers, are you?

13
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:46,797
You moron!

14
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,797
Are you mental?

15
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,880
- Hey, don't you dare hit me!
- Well, your truck hit my scooter first!

16
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,338
- Stop shouting!
- Should I start singing then?

17
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:56,505
Stop!

18
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:58,088
Kabir, let go of him!

19
00:02:58,172 --> 00:03:03,463
Hey, what's going on!
Stop fighting!

20
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:05,547
The driver made a mistake.

21
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,797
Greetings, Uncle.

22
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:08,838
Snake dance!

23
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:10,213
Snake dance?

24
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,255
Stop it!

25
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:21,088
- Pick up your scooter.
- Uncle, I am Ved Prakash's son.

26
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:24,880
Saw you in dad's wedding album.
You were doing the snake dance.

27
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:27,797
- He's Dheela's son. Dr. Dheela!
- Dr. Dheela?

28
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,064
- That's you?
- Greetings, Uncle.

29
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:32,297
God bless.
How's everything? All good?

30
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,838
Help move our things!

31
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:42,297
- Uncle, this way.
- Yes. Let's go.

32
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:43,463
Careful!

33
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,547
The bag's quite heavy.

34
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:48,088
Kabir!

35
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:52,755
- Kabir!
- Uncle, follow me!

36
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,088
Mind your head, Uncle.

37
00:03:56,672 --> 00:03:58,630
Nothing's changed here.

38
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:00,797
- Yes, Uncle.
- How's your father Dheela?

39
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,172
All good, Uncle.

40
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:04,088
An injection costs a dollar now...

41
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:06,172
- Hello.
- Hello.

42
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,422
And the red pill
still saves the day!

43
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:14,588
He's started his own hospital.
Keeps busy.

44
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:18,047
Open the windows.
Let the air in.

45
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,005
Anees, there are 32 cartons and bags.

46
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,088
All here.

47
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:24,797
Hey, where to?

48
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,047
For my band rehearsals.

49
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,463
Not now!
We're going to Kuljeet's for lunch.

50
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:30,672
His mother, Beeji, is cooking.
Don't miss it.

51
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:33,630
I'll go fetch dad.

52
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,838
- Take off that garland.
- Here, you put it on.

53
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:39,213
- What do I do with it?
- Hey, bring it here!

54
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:51,130
- Hello, Beeji!
- Welcome, son!

55
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:54,838
Let's go in.
It's cold outside.

56
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,547
- Come, everyone.
- Come here.

57
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,463
- Coming!
- Come here, Mathur.

58
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:01,963
- Come, let's stand in a group.
- Beautiful. See!

59
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,338
Stop sulking, Mittal.

60
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:05,755
Look here.

61
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,213
Pout, everyone.

62
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:08,588
- Pout?
- Here!

63
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:10,088
Wait!

64
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:12,297
Dr. Dheela is here!

65
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,755
- Mr. Dheela!
- Heâ€™s slow, just like his name.

66
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:16,380
Let's pout.

67
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,005
Done.

68
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,963
Take them off!

69
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:26,088
Come, take a selfie with Beeji.

70
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,463
This kiss can heal.

71
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:29,922
It will make your skin glow!

72
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:32,547
Look how beautiful we look!

73
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,505
- Eat now.
- I need a spoon.

74
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,422
Who eats <i>Rajma Chawal</i> with a spoon?

75
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,797
Exactly.

76
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,255
I always eat with a spoon.

77
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:50,588
No problem.
Sapna, get him a spoon.

78
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:52,005
This is the new generation.

79
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:56,005
Anees, a few spoons, please.

80
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:03,172
You know,
the dress that I'm wearing...

81
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,088
your mother had given it to me
15 years ago.

82
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,172
You remember?

83
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:10,547
Even now people ask where it's from.
It's still in fashion.

84
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,088
It's your mother who taught me
about style and fashion.

85
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,463
I didn't know anything.

86
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:17,005
I don't think you know
how mod your mother was.

87
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:20,105
If she would've been here,
she'd have made me cut my hair short...

88
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,130
- What happened?
- Kabir!

89
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,088
You crocodile!

90
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:28,713
Why did you have to be
a drama queen?

91
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,130
Didn't even let him eat the <i>rajma!</i>

92
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:34,130
How could he?
He remembered his mother!

93
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,047
What's more important?
"Ma" or <i>"Rajma"?</i>

94
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:33,547
You missed the rehearsals and
didn't show up for the gig either.

95
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,922
- Tony's pissed off!
- He can go to hell!

96
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,047
He says the same to you.

97
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,297
He has started a new
fucking band without us.

98
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,338
Anees Uncle! Water!

99
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:15,255
Potty is potty.

100
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:17,588
What difference does it make
if it's Indian or western?

101
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,047
Hello, Uncle.

102
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:27,630
He smiled.

103
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:31,880
- That smile cost me 9870 bucks.
- Is it?

104
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:35,130
Bought an English throne
for my spoilt child.

105
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:43,088
Wow! Such delicious food!

106
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:38,505
<i>Titu's wedding. Traffic jam.
Waste of money.</i>

107
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:07,380
You have something
to say to me or not?

108
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:09,588
Take those off.

109
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:12,422
Do you have a tongue?

110
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,630
Can you speak at all?

111
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,463
What do you want to hear?

112
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,213
Tell me. I am listening.

113
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,547
Do you have anything
to talk about?

114
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:25,255
Tell me!

115
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:36,338
If he won't talk to you,
learn to "chat" with him.

116
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:39,797
Son, it's important to
to keep up with the technology.

117
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,255
She's right.

118
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:45,338
Tell me. If I learn all this...

119
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:50,047
this communication gap
between me and Kabir...

120
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,922
can it be fixed?

121
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:53,588
I'll explain.

122
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:56,005
The awkwardness we feel
face to face...

123
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,463
vanishes with this device.

124
00:10:57,547 --> 00:11:01,672
This generation speak with
their fingers rather than their mouths.

125
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:05,463
What if, at this age,
I am unable to learn?

126
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,255
If she can, anybody can.

127
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:11,130
Excuse me! I'm a Science graduate!

128
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,880
Home Science doesn't
make you a scientist!

129
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,172
Okay, Beeji. Here.

130
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:19,588
Put that technology stuff
into my phone.

131
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:22,338
This phone is no good.

132
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:23,672
What's wrong with it?

133
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,130
You need a smart phone.

134
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:26,463
It is smart.

135
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:28,838
You are, not your phone.

136
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:31,297
Beeji, stop making me spend so much.

137
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,922
He's saying he wants
Facebook in this phone!

138
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:35,588
You guys are insulting me!

139
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,088
Sir, this is the hottest item in
the market right now.

140
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:47,797
In this you'll get
a 64-bit Octa core processor.

141
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,130
With a 16 GB memory.

142
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:52,755
And a 14 centimeter HD screen.

143
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,338
Okay...

144
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,838
It's an auspicious day.

145
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:58,338
The phone will bring me luck
if I buy it today.

146
00:11:58,422 --> 00:12:00,213
Sir, which internet plan
would you prefer?

147
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:01,672
The 4G plan.

148
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,672
- 2G is fine.
- Uncle...

149
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,922
4G is the internet speed.

150
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,088
You are talking about GB.

151
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,213
Forget 2 GB.
1 GB should do for you.

152
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,130
<i>Kabir, your dad is on Facebook.</i>

153
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:14,963
<i>He's sent me a friend request.</i>

154
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,380
Brilliant!

155
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,547
What a tune!

156
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,297
Here, 1000 bucks from me.

157
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:34,338
I belong to the Mughal Family.

158
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,588
Nobody says no to us!

159
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,755
Keep it!

160
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:46,505
Son, I have not eaten all day.
Please lend me 40 bucks.

161
00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:06,380
Come on, one more.

162
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:08,797
Two more.
Properly!

163
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:12,255
This is our version of Zumba.

164
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,213
It helps his hip injury.

165
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:22,213
Tell me, in how many working
days will Kabir get my request?

166
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:26,380
It takes just a second!

167
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:28,463
Everything happens
instantly on the internet.

168
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:30,338
I'll teach you.

169
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:31,422
Have some sweets.

170
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:33,172
Let's see what he says.

171
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:40,297
Look at this!
He's rejected your request!

172
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:43,963
He's even blocked you.

173
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,755
He rejected me?

174
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:32,922
Now listen to what's right...

175
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,672
which may sound a bit wrong.

176
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:40,297
But it's still right.
Come here.

177
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:47,588
- Which one do you like?
- Why?

178
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:51,922
- This is to relax you.
- What are you saying, Beeji?

179
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,588
Not for you, stupid.

180
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,213
For Kabir.

181
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:03,088
- This one.
- Isn't she gorgeous?

182
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,713
Seeing her, Kabir will fell in love!

183
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:12,255
Auntie, please!

184
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:14,505
Auntie, we're not going to run away!

185
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:22,338
Why can't I cry at the right time?

186
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,380
Seher, how could you?

187
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,547
Who splurges rent money on booze?

188
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,630
We're screwed!

189
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:30,338
Saturday nights do this to me.

190
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,797
I could loot the country
on a Saturday.

191
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:34,547
It's disgusting.

192
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:37,380
- Take a loan from Baljeet.
- Baljeet?

193
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,297
He'll start planning our wedding.

194
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:42,713
Your life's so full of complications!

195
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:45,213
How about you
taking a loan for a change?

196
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:47,172
It's an art.

197
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,172
Not everyone has that talent.

198
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:52,213
Quite right.

199
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,088
Go through hell like me
and then you'll learn.

200
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,422
- Anupji is here.
- Anupji!

201
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,255
We're done for!

202
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,630
Your wife is kicking us out!

203
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,713
What will we do now?

204
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:12,130
Leave it to me.

205
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:15,380
Anupji, your beard!
Why did you dye it?

206
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,505
The salt & pepper looked so good on you.

207
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:20,963
Just like George Clooney.

208
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:24,880
- Right?
- So Clooney!

209
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:29,713
Go, give it to her.

210
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:33,255
Anupji!

211
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,005
Sukhi!

212
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:44,005
It's me! Open up!

213
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,297
Sukhi, open the door!

214
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,672
There you are.
Look, I got vegetables for you.

215
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:50,297
Here.

216
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,463
I kept it for essentials.

217
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:58,005
Thought you'd have pity on us.

218
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:02,172
There was an inactive account of a girl.

219
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:06,838
I saved her photos and created a new
account, in the name of Tara.

220
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:09,255
I use this account to chat.

221
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:11,213
Beeji has many fake accounts.

222
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,255
Rahul, Reuben, Michael...

223
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:19,713
Son, use Tara's account
to send a request to Kabir.

224
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:22,172
Why should I become this girl?

225
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:27,963
Because, a request from a hottie like Tara
will never be refused by any boy!

226
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,380
I still don't see why...

227
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:33,547
- I mean...
- Don't get confused.

228
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,672
It's simple.

229
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:38,172
You need to become Tara so you
can chat with Kabir. Simple!

230
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:41,463
Her face, your words.

231
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:45,547
Under this guise,
you'll be able to talk to your son.

232
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,630
I get it.

233
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:52,130
At least we will talk. You're right!

234
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:53,755
Send the request.

235
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,588
- Go on, Beeji.
- I'm doing it.

236
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,088
I've set the Facebook
account for you.

237
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,963
Now enjoy gossiping with Kabir.

238
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Awesome.

239
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:16,588
He's accepted Tara's friend request.
Look.

240
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,505
He blocked his father's request

241
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:23,297
but the girl's face
made him accept it in seconds.

242
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,755
You'd have done the same.

243
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:30,838
Go on, reply.

244
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:32,797
I don't know how to do this.
You reply.

245
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Okay, tell me.

246
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:38,338
"I saw your photo...
and my heart sang."

247
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:48,713
LOL?
Is he cussing me?

248
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:51,963
LOL means, "Laugh Out Loud!"

249
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,963
After ages I've heard my child laugh.

250
00:18:57,047 --> 00:19:02,547
LOL, ILY, XOXO, BRB...
these are chat codes.

251
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,963
Mug it up and become trendy.

252
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:09,380
Be romantic or else your
kid will run away.

253
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:12,588
<i>Yet, you sent the request.</i>

254
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:17,630
If you don't want to be friends...

255
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:22,255
then unfriend me,
block me, cancel me.

256
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:26,005
- Show her the new stock.
- My husband doesn't like that style.

257
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,338
He'll run away!

258
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:29,255
Show me something else.

259
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:32,005
He won't run away.
In fact, he'll stop doubting you.

260
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,505
Why not show her that one?

261
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:37,880
Here. The cups have a firm grip.

262
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:40,130
That reminds me.
I'd like a cup of tea.

263
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,213
Two cups of tea, son.

264
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:47,213
You're at a ladies' shop.
Mind your language.

265
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:49,047
I'm out of here!

266
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,588
<i>Jobless by choice!
And you?</i>

267
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:53,755
<i>Me, too!</i>

268
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:00,755
Ask him where he works.

269
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,463
"Where do you work?"

270
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:07,755
He says Larsen & Toubro.

271
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:10,005
Bloody liar!

272
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,047
- Should I write that?
- Don't be stupid!

273
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:14,422
JK, boss.

274
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,713
Who's JK?

275
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:18,380
JK means, "Just Kidding!"

276
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,255
Don't start now.

277
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:22,505
Now write.
"How much do you earn?"

278
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,630
Okay.

279
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:27,630
You sing well.

280
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:30,797
But for this place, we need something big.

281
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:34,672
You don't even have a band.

282
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,380
Get in touch when you form one.

283
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,213
All couples here.
How will we find our guinea pig?

284
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:43,713
That's the problem!

285
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:45,630
- What should we do?
- Excuse me.

286
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:47,922
Hello, respected ma'am.

287
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:49,338
How do you do, respected ma'am?

288
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,713
You girls need company?

289
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:56,297
We need limited company.

290
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:58,422
Not unlimited.

291
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:04,630
Seher, you crazy?
He owns a Merc!

292
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,922
So? It must be rented.

293
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,505
Look at his shoes.

294
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:11,005
He's wearing Niki
instead of Nike.

295
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:16,172
You've spent a year with me!
Still not learnt to observe?

296
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:18,588
- Sorry!
- When will you learn?

297
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,588
- Hello, sir. How are you?
- What's up, brother?

298
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,588
- Shit! Run!
- Seher!

299
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:27,005
- Single!
- Seher baby!

300
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:29,005
Seher baby!
Why are you running away?

301
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,005
Excuse me, sir!

302
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,208
- Stag entry not allowed, sir.
- That's my girlfriend!

303
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:33,880
- You'll stop me?
- Yes, sir.

304
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:35,297
What are you saying!

305
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:37,838
Look into my eyes and say,
"Stag entry not allowed."

306
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,005
Once more.

307
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,047
Who's the new chick?

308
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,610
You don't tell me
anything these days.

309
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,713
She's a Facebook friend
from Canada.

310
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:54,338
Wish she was from here.

311
00:21:55,338 --> 00:22:00,505
I have some strange
connection with her.

312
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,338
I don't understand all this.

313
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:06,547
Got the bill?

314
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:08,047
- Yes.
- Shall we go?

315
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,130
Sure.

316
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:13,338
Tell me something.

317
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,463
How did this connection happen?

318
00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:20,588
From Old Delhi to Canada...
with a chick called Tara!

319
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:27,505
Shit! Looks like
the bill is on us tonight.

320
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,338
You'll only have a soda, right?

321
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:31,755
Just go a little slow
on this Tara/Facebook gig.

322
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,088
- Why?
- Because, it happened with me once.

323
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:36,088
- What?
- Her photograph was stunning.

324
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,088
Met her, and "she" was a "he."

325
00:22:38,463 --> 00:22:41,297
- Face of a girl, stuff of a man.
- Seriously?

326
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,047
You son of a...
Are you mad or what?

327
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:46,297
You motherfu...
Mo... Mo...

328
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:52,963
Your eyes are innocent.
Keep it that way.

329
00:22:58,422 --> 00:22:59,713
Why are you laughing?

330
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,463
His number plate has a 9999 on it.
A VIP!

331
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:06,088
- Did you see his revolver?
- It's okay.

332
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:10,463
By the way, did you know that your dad
and Tony are Facebook friends?

333
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,797
<i>I wonder why our parents
are on Facebook now.</i>

334
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,463
<i>I don't have a dad.
So, my mom is my friend.</i>

335
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:17,547
<i>Not just on Facebook,
even in life.</i>

336
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:21,713
<i>Mom is no more,
and Dad isn't my friend.</i>

337
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:23,963
<i>Neither on Facebook, nor in life.</i>

338
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,422
Tell me once and for all.

339
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,213
Do you intend to do your MBA or not?

340
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:31,088
I don't want to.

341
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:34,797
Your phone keeps you
busy all day, doesn't it?

342
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:36,547
Same goes for you these days.

343
00:23:36,797 --> 00:23:38,463
Sit down!

344
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:42,255
You won't be the one
to always leave the table.

345
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,713
It's my turn today!

346
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:57,047
Anees! The food was too spicy today!

347
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,755
<i>I feel like running away.</i>

348
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:07,922
<i>Why?</i>

349
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,505
<i>He is so selfish.</i>

350
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:11,588
<i>I'm in this godforsaken Old Delhi
because of him.</i>

351
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:14,463
<i>He said, "I want to move to Old Delhi
to be with my friends."</i>

352
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,463
<i>He didn't bother about
me and my friends.</i>

353
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,630
<i>My band broke up
because of him.</i>

354
00:24:20,547 --> 00:24:23,047
<i>That house holds
the memories of my mother.</i>

355
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,588
<i>I hate Old Delhi.</i>

356
00:24:29,547 --> 00:24:34,005
<i>If you hate it so much,
why don't you just leave?</i>

357
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,547
- Eat your food.
- Yeah, I will.

358
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:50,255
First, read this.

359
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,380
"My Dad wanted me to study Law.

360
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:56,005
So that I could manage
his law firm.

361
00:24:56,088 --> 00:24:59,505
But I wanted to go to Canada.

362
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:03,922
Now that Canada has failed,
and I've lost him too...

363
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:06,297
I feel, maybe I should
have done Law."

364
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:12,255
You really regret not studying Law?

365
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:13,713
Yes.

366
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,922
You know, Kuljeet...

367
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:20,130
fathers are never wrong
about their children.

368
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:22,880
Write this too.

369
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:25,755
"Fathers are very
important in this world.

370
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:30,172
We should value them
while we have them."

371
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:35,213
Bloody blackmailer!

372
00:25:35,963 --> 00:25:37,505
It's not blackmail.

373
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:41,380
It's called, "creating an impact."

374
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:44,130
You bet! Now eat.

375
00:25:44,338 --> 00:25:47,130
- Sapna made it specially for you.
- Alright.

376
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,880
- The impact is made!
- What's he saying?

377
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,880
"It depends on your parents.

378
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:56,463
My mom was important for me.
But my dad..."

379
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,422
Dad?

380
00:26:01,797 --> 00:26:02,963
"Is not important at all."

381
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,880
That's what he said?

382
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:17,130
<i>You got your musical flair from your mom?</i>

383
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:20,172
<i>How did you guess?</i>

384
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:26,338
<i>From what you say,
it seems your father's a duffer.</i>

385
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:33,755
<i>Not a duffer.</i>

386
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:40,588
<i>Whenever my mom sang,
he fell asleep.</i>

387
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:51,338
<i>Kabir, try to understand your dad.</i>

388
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:53,880
<i>You only see your own pain...</i>

389
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:56,463
<i>not your father's loneliness.</i>

390
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:59,797
<i>Imagine what it feels like
to lose a partner!</i>

391
00:27:15,672 --> 00:27:16,755
What happened?

392
00:27:16,838 --> 00:27:19,838
Nothing. It's getting cold.
Should I get your shawl?

393
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:22,838
Okay.

394
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:47,463
<i>My mom used to sing this song.</i>

395
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:49,755
<i>Should I send it to you?</i>

396
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,255
<i>Listen to it on your headphones.</i>

397
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:58,505
Now where will I get headphones from?

398
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:06,338
Yes, Anees Uncle?

399
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:09,463
Bro, I need your ears' thing.
What's it called?

400
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,297
This thing around your neck.

401
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:15,463
Lend them to me.
My speaker's not working.

402
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:17,630
I have an extra.

403
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,838
- Will this work?
- Yes, thank you.

404
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:40,422
<i>When I look into your eyes I see</i>

405
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:44,755
<i>Our story</i>

406
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:51,463
<i>Bits of you and bits of me</i>

407
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:55,172
<i>Make our story</i>

408
00:28:55,838 --> 00:29:01,672
<i>Our conversations have no
Beginning or end</i>

409
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:09,880
<i>They blend into each other
Like nights and days</i>

410
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:16,380
<i>You begin where I finish and
I begin where you finish</i>

411
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:21,005
<i>That's our story</i>

412
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:27,005
<i>When I look into your eyes I see</i>

413
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:32,130
<i>Our story</i>

414
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:55,422
- Kabir.
- Yes, Papa?

415
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,922
Here.

416
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:04,547
Don't give your
headphones to Anees.

417
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,255
He doesn't bathe for weeks.

418
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:08,922
Son, I was thinking...

419
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:11,672
why not start a new band?

420
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:14,588
It's not that easy.

421
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:16,630
Son, please do something in your life.

422
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:20,088
I'm worried about you.

423
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:24,172
And my financial situation is not...

424
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:27,172
What happened?

425
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:31,755
Nothing happened.
Just that...

426
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,713
I am here for you but
I won't be there forever.

427
00:30:47,797 --> 00:30:52,130
<i>My dad wrote
a poem for my mother.</i>

428
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:55,005
<i>Can you make a song out of it?</i>

429
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:03,880
What do you think?
Isn't he just like his mother?

430
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:06,130
Thank God he's not like you.

431
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,838
Stop taunting me all the time.

432
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:11,505
Thank your stars I didn't kill you.

433
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:19,713
Your wife told me everything on Facebook.

434
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:22,172
How Ahuja fucked you over in business.

435
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,922
Now you want to fuck me over
by reminding me of it?

436
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:29,088
You rejected my business offer...

437
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:32,255
to partner with that bastard Ahuja.

438
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:36,547
"I must move to New Delhi.
I must get out of here!

439
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,588
It's so crowded here.
So dirty!

440
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:39,880
I need to get out!"

441
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:41,422
Imagine if you had not left!

442
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:43,838
We would have been together
all these years.

443
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:51,922
Mathur, it's Kabir calling.

444
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:56,213
Yes, Kabir?

445
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:59,380
<i>What is your favourite color?</i>

446
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:05,463
- Why?
<i>- I am buying headphones for you.</i>

447
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,922
<i>That's why I asked.</i>

448
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:10,463
Let me see.
Red sounds good.

449
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,380
<i>Okay, Papa.</i>

450
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:19,130
Kabir is buying
red headphones for me.

451
00:32:19,422 --> 00:32:23,005
Don't you think Kabir has changed for
good ever since you became Tara?

452
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:24,713
I think so.

453
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:27,047
Nobody doubts your talent, Seher.

454
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,130
But this time, it was a bit of a
struggle to get an appointment.

455
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:34,422
She takes a lot of leaves, Mrs. Gulati.

456
00:32:34,588 --> 00:32:36,838
Actually, I wasn't feeling too well.

457
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,755
You know, ladies' problem...

458
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:43,380
When are you returning
the 10,000 bucks you owe me?

459
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,588
Very soon.

460
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,713
- Actually, that...
- Seher, this is not right.

461
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:53,481
- What are you doing, Paro?
- Sorry!

462
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:56,088
- Paro!
- I am sorry!

463
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:07,172
"How will the world understand
the noise inside me?

464
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:10,380
Oh, Lord. Silence this noise!"

465
00:33:23,255 --> 00:33:25,297
He's talking about
our song on YouTube.

466
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,878
- Please meet my band, please!
- What are you doing?

467
00:33:39,338 --> 00:33:40,547
Brother...

468
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:42,880
for us guitar is no more!

469
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:46,630
If your guitar mix our sax,
Delhi on fire!

470
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,130
And you, small timers...

471
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:51,505
this is my musical YouTube star!

472
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:52,588
I'm Ghannu.

473
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
I am Fantu.

474
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,088
<i>Let's see that ass shakin'</i>

475
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:31,797
<i>Let's see the booty movin'</i>

476
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,130
<i>Let's see what you got
Oh, baby doll</i>

477
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:44,713
<i>Oh, baby doll!</i>

478
00:34:45,172 --> 00:34:51,672
<i>You wear the glow of the sun</i>

479
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:57,255
<i>Oh, my Delhi!</i>

480
00:34:57,338 --> 00:35:03,380
<i>Bruised by many</i>

481
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:07,255
<i>Yet unclaimed you stand</i>

482
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:14,380
<i>You stand bright and tall</i>

483
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:17,463
<i>Such is Delhi</i>

484
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:22,463
<i>My good old Delhi!</i>

485
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:37,338
Anees Uncle, you've always
lived alone here?

486
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:38,672
Why?

487
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:41,088
Don't you have a home?
Family?

488
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:43,755
Old Delhi is my only home.

489
00:35:44,505 --> 00:35:47,630
For me, its every lane is
filled with memories.

490
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,380
I had an affair
with your father's sister.

491
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,172
Aunt Neelu?

492
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,088
It lasted five years...

493
00:35:58,505 --> 00:35:59,755
in silence.

494
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:05,963
Her smile? It would speak!

495
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:12,630
Wherever her rickshaw went,
my Yezdi followed.

496
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,463
"Scram!"

497
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,088
Does dad know?

498
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:21,213
I didn't let your aunt know.
How would he?

499
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:22,422
Why?

500
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,005
Because I am a Muslim and...

501
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:29,588
Anees Uncle, you could have eloped.

502
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:37,380
Don't be crazy.

503
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,672
Why leave my magnificent
Old Delhi for a love affair?

504
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,213
What's so special about Old Delhi?

505
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:00,047
You still have this toy?

506
00:37:01,297 --> 00:37:05,338
Remember how your dad would fly
you around the world on this?

507
00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:09,338
Don't be so angry at Old Delhi.

508
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:11,338
New Delhi grew out of it.

509
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:13,255
What good are these memories?

510
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,547
It's strange... Kabir.

511
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:27,713
Try experiencing this place
through your mother's eyes.

512
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,255
Turn your pain into hope.

513
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:53,797
<i>You too had wonderful times there,
during your childhood.</i>

514
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:55,130
<i>I don't remember.</i>

515
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:56,422
<i>In any case...</i>

516
00:37:56,463 --> 00:37:58,963
<i>what's in Old Delhi
that you miss so much?</i>

517
00:37:59,963 --> 00:38:02,963
<i>I can't tell you.
I can show you!</i>

518
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,755
<i>Someday, we'll go there.</i>

519
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:13,380
<i>Let's see that ass shakin'</i>

520
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,213
<i>Let's see that booty movin'</i>

521
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:19,005
<i>Let's see what you got
Oh, baby doll!</i>

522
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:29,922
Jackie, bro!

523
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:35,755
Kabir, Sanju, Babaji.

524
00:42:59,547 --> 00:43:04,588
Just turn the Bluetooth on,
search and connect. Then play.

525
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:05,963
It's on!
It's working!

526
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,588
It's amazing!

527
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:57,588
You get the tastiest street food here!

528
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:58,963
Stop.

529
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:00,130
See that?

530
00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:02,547
Your mother's favorite shop.

531
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:05,505
She loved the samosas here.

532
00:44:06,047 --> 00:44:08,005
- Come, try it.
- No.

533
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:09,797
That is not an option.

534
00:44:09,963 --> 00:44:11,922
Brother, we'll be right back.
Come on!

535
00:44:12,213 --> 00:44:13,755
You have to taste it!

536
00:44:22,713 --> 00:44:24,297
- Papa.
- What?

537
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,505
I'll be home late.

538
00:44:25,588 --> 00:44:26,755
I have a show tonight.

539
00:44:28,088 --> 00:44:29,672
We've never heard you sing.

540
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:33,422
He's got his music from his mother.

541
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,755
- She had a beautiful voice.
- Really?

542
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,439
Whenever I got back home tired from work

543
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:40,630
her singing would soothe me to sleep.

544
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:42,380
It was bliss!

545
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:44,755
When will we get
to hear your music?

546
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,338
There's a pub called Factory.
I'm performing there tonight.

547
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,797
- Please come, all of you.
- Sure.

548
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,588
It's my first show
with the new band.

549
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:58,172
Playing for drunkards at a bar?

550
00:44:58,255 --> 00:44:59,880
Doesn't matter. We will be there.

551
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:02,380
Of course, we'll come.

552
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:04,088
Mittal, Mathur and myself.

553
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:06,588
After all, it's you performing!

554
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:08,338
And we'll have a peg each.

555
00:45:18,755 --> 00:45:20,213
I'm here for mom.

556
00:45:54,422 --> 00:45:55,755
Hey, mister! Hello?

557
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:59,880
- What's the matter?
- Who are you?

558
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:02,755
- Kabir.
- Kabir who?

559
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:04,338
Kabir Mathur.
This is my house.

560
00:46:04,422 --> 00:46:06,005
Oh! You are Mathur's son?

561
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,630
We have bought this house.

562
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,755
Please leave.

563
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:14,297
Didn't your father tell you
that he sold the house?

564
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:17,755
- Let's go, Sanju.
- What happened?

565
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:44,047
<i>Your principles,
Your rules</i>

566
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:51,047
<i>Why must I obey at all times?</i>

567
00:46:51,588 --> 00:46:54,963
<i>When I reject your laws</i>

568
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:58,588
<i>That confine me</i>

569
00:46:58,672 --> 00:47:05,172
<i>It unsettles you</i>

570
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,213
<i>Don't tie me down</i>

571
00:47:09,297 --> 00:47:14,380
<i>Don't restrict me</i>

572
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:21,422
<i>These rules are a farce
So are your laws</i>

573
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:28,755
<i>Why should I listen to your nonsense?</i>

574
00:47:28,838 --> 00:47:32,380
<i>Oh hypocrite!</i>

575
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:36,047
<i>You are killing me</i>

576
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:42,713
<i>With your sweet words</i>

577
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:46,797
<i>Oh hypocrite!</i>

578
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,505
<i>You are killing me</i>

579
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:56,755
<i>With your sweet words</i>

580
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:20,255
<i>Your intentions...</i>

581
00:48:20,672 --> 00:48:24,922
<i>All...</i>

582
00:48:25,213 --> 00:48:28,838
<i>Your promises</i>

583
00:48:29,005 --> 00:48:32,297
<i>Your intentions
All your promises</i>

584
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,047
<i>I will reveal the truth</i>

585
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:42,547
<i>To every one</i>

586
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:46,755
<i>You deceive, you mislead</i>

587
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:50,380
<i>Your show of dreams</i>

588
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:56,630
<i>Selling palaces of lies</i>

589
00:48:57,588 --> 00:49:00,880
<i>Don't play tricks with my emotions</i>

590
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:06,338
<i>Tomorrow, your apologies won't matter</i>

591
00:49:06,422 --> 00:49:09,672
<i>You'll always be questioned</i>

592
00:49:09,755 --> 00:49:13,297
<i>Then the world will know</i>

593
00:49:13,588 --> 00:49:20,213
<i>You lead a band of dacoits</i>

594
00:49:20,797 --> 00:49:24,172
<i>Oh hypocrite!</i>

595
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:27,963
<i>You are killing me</i>

596
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:34,338
<i>With your sweet words</i>

597
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:38,380
Let go of me!

598
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:40,505
Don't you understand?

599
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:48,047
- Bloody asshole!
- Tara? Hi!

600
00:49:53,172 --> 00:49:54,755
- That's Tara!
- What?

601
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:56,172
Tara from Facebook!

602
00:49:56,505 --> 00:49:58,130
How come you are here?

603
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:01,255
I can't believe it.

604
00:50:03,672 --> 00:50:04,755
Me too.

605
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:08,672
Check out that kiss!

606
00:50:08,963 --> 00:50:10,564
- What are you looking at?
- The kiss, what else?

607
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:11,630
Bloody motherfucker!

608
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:12,713
- Run!
- Why?

609
00:50:12,755 --> 00:50:14,130
Seher, we're screwed!

610
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:16,047
What's going on?
Let's go!

611
00:50:17,005 --> 00:50:19,672
- Tara, why are we running?
- Just run!

612
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:21,463
When did you come back from Canada?

613
00:50:21,672 --> 00:50:22,755
Wait for me!

614
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:24,797
- Tara, stop!
- Come on, hurry!

615
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:26,463
Get out of the way!

616
00:50:26,713 --> 00:50:29,547
Tara, you are so different
on Facebook!

617
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,422
I'm not on Facebook, you prick!

618
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:34,130
- Drive, mister!
- Seher! Don't go!

619
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Asshole, just wait!
I'll play you like a fucking guitar!

620
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:39,838
Bastard! Where's the valet?
Where's my Audi?

621
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:42,130
Kabir, what a performance!

622
00:50:45,422 --> 00:50:46,422
Liar.

623
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:48,338
Another lie.

624
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,047
You're always lying!

625
00:50:52,297 --> 00:50:54,505
I think he's figured it out.

626
00:50:55,047 --> 00:50:57,588
Selling the house
was my last resort!

627
00:50:57,963 --> 00:50:59,505
I was about to tell you.

628
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:01,130
All you do is lie.

629
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,880
It's a habit with you.

630
00:51:03,047 --> 00:51:04,297
What have I lied about?

631
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,422
Mom's accident?

632
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:08,880
When I got to know, you said it was minor.

633
00:51:09,088 --> 00:51:11,463
So minor that she died?

634
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:13,297
You shirked spending
on a good hospital.

635
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,740
That's the truth
you never told me.

636
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,047
You saved your money!

637
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,713
Now, you sold our house!
It was only about the money, right?

638
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:22,088
How dare you!

639
00:51:26,672 --> 00:51:28,755
Where are you going?
I am talking to you, Kabir!

640
00:51:29,713 --> 00:51:32,088
The truth is,
I was completely broke.

641
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,255
After your mother's death
I was buried in debts.

642
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:39,047
Then, Ahuja betrayed me.
He cheated me.

643
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:40,672
I was forced to sell our house.

644
00:51:40,755 --> 00:51:42,505
I was about to tell you!

645
00:51:42,588 --> 00:51:44,422
- Kabir!
- Kabir, what are you doing?

646
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:45,505
Leave me alone!

647
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,630
Don't do this!

648
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:48,922
Boss...

649
00:52:06,213 --> 00:52:08,213
Get the fuck out and never
show me your face again!

650
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:10,713
Just get out!

651
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:13,088
Good-for-nothing!

652
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:30,880
A light, brother?

653
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:48,255
I hope you're not considering suicide.

654
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:51,422
Don't! It's very painful.

655
00:52:57,047 --> 00:52:59,547
I had tried it once.

656
00:53:00,672 --> 00:53:02,130
It hurt like a bitch.

657
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:13,172
I'll talk to him
and get back to you, Uncle.

658
00:53:15,422 --> 00:53:18,630
- Your dad called again.
- I must find that guy who cussed at me.

659
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:20,838
Leave that for now.
Just call your dad.

660
00:53:20,922 --> 00:53:23,463
He's worried sick.
He's called me ten times already!

661
00:53:23,672 --> 00:53:25,672
He has many others
to look after him.

662
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,172
Can I stay at your house or not?

663
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,080
I know you're upset but don't
consider everyone selfish.

664
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,672
- Or a liar!
- They are all liars!

665
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,814
- What!
- I need to find her!

666
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:38,838
Go to hell!

667
00:53:42,713 --> 00:53:45,172
<i>Tara, why did you lie?</i>

668
00:53:46,213 --> 00:53:48,130
I think it's Kabir's message.

669
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:52,213
If you're not on Facebook,
then who are you?

670
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,005
I know you're in Delhi.
Why did you lie?

671
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,047
Did you hear that, Beeji?

672
00:53:57,213 --> 00:54:00,838
Don't give me that look.

673
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,672
My intentions were right.

674
00:54:02,755 --> 00:54:04,797
Good, the girl didn't say much...

675
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,380
or I'd be registered a liar, right?

676
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:09,880
Beeji... this is all a mess!

677
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:12,213
You meant well
but it's gone wrong.

678
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:18,547
You can't just kiss me and run off!

679
00:54:19,213 --> 00:54:23,047
The lies are getting to him,
both yours and Tara's.

680
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:25,047
But I am Tara!

681
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,130
True.

682
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,005
- Oh, God!
- What's he saying now?

683
00:54:29,297 --> 00:54:32,630
I'll go to the cyber police.
I'll find you, no matter what.

684
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:36,922
Beeji, it's all got out of hand.

685
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:38,005
Be quiet!

686
00:54:38,213 --> 00:54:40,005
I swear to God...

687
00:54:40,297 --> 00:54:42,172
I thought it through, technically.

688
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:45,172
The girl I found...

689
00:54:45,505 --> 00:54:46,672
wasn't from here.

690
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:50,005
And she has been inactive on
Facebook for a year and a half.

691
00:54:50,297 --> 00:54:52,047
Trace her, for heaven's sake.

692
00:54:52,297 --> 00:54:55,963
Do whatever it takes
or else we are all done for.

693
00:54:56,047 --> 00:54:58,130
But where, in this huge city?

694
00:54:58,297 --> 00:55:00,255
Let me see her picture.

695
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,505
Let's zoom-in on her picture.

696
00:55:05,213 --> 00:55:06,213
Look.

697
00:55:06,797 --> 00:55:08,755
Abu Road, Meerut.

698
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:10,005
Meerut?

699
00:55:10,088 --> 00:55:12,088
That's the board.

700
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:13,630
Excuse me.

701
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:15,755
Do you recognize her?

702
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,172
Benny sir!

703
00:55:20,005 --> 00:55:21,672
What's wrong?

704
00:55:22,213 --> 00:55:23,088
- What is it?
- Look here.

705
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:26,672
Isn't she the same girl?
That lawyer's son's friend.

706
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:29,005
Yes, she studied here.

707
00:55:29,088 --> 00:55:31,672
Her name is Seher Chowdhary.
She had scored a 92%.

708
00:55:31,755 --> 00:55:32,755
Where can we find her?

709
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:36,672
Go to Victoria Park,
towards Cantonment.

710
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:38,172
You'll reach All Saints School.

711
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:42,130
Ask for Warden Ratan Chowdhary.
She's his daughter.

712
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,213
This one!

713
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:44,505
Pause here.

714
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:46,172
This girl?

715
00:55:46,713 --> 00:55:48,297
She's a gold digger, sir.

716
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:49,588
Pause here.

717
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,672
And that is Baljeet.

718
00:55:51,755 --> 00:55:53,130
That's the VIP!

719
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,672
He almost ran us over.

720
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:56,880
- He's the one?
- Yes.

721
00:55:56,963 --> 00:55:58,338
He's the one who cussed at me!

722
00:55:58,713 --> 00:55:59,797
Stay away from him.

723
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:01,380
He's a hothead.

724
00:56:06,047 --> 00:56:07,797
Are you in love with this girl?

725
00:56:08,755 --> 00:56:10,088
Let's go for rehearsals.

726
00:56:12,213 --> 00:56:14,463
Kabir! What's wrong with you?

727
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:16,338
Our new band is a hit.

728
00:56:16,422 --> 00:56:18,922
Music labels are interested.
We're getting gigs. And you...

729
00:56:19,005 --> 00:56:21,838
I want to know
why she lied to me.

730
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:29,338
- Hello.
- Hello.

731
00:56:29,547 --> 00:56:32,380
We wanted to meet Seher Chowdhary.

732
00:56:35,047 --> 00:56:37,672
Listen, her antics have
troubled us a lot.

733
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,672
We have no idea where she is.

734
00:56:40,047 --> 00:56:41,797
Please, leave us alone.

735
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,731
Sir, we've come a long way...

736
00:56:43,755 --> 00:56:46,672
I told you once.
Please leave.

737
00:56:46,755 --> 00:56:47,755
But, sir...

738
00:56:48,047 --> 00:56:50,130
Please leave!

739
00:56:53,005 --> 00:56:55,838
- We must look for her somewhere.
- Such an insolent man!

740
00:56:55,922 --> 00:56:57,213
Let's go back to Delhi.

741
00:56:57,297 --> 00:56:59,088
Uncle!

742
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:04,922
This is the contact number of the
salon where Seher works.

743
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,380
She's in Delhi.

744
00:57:07,005 --> 00:57:10,380
When I need to talk to my sister,
I reach her on this number.

745
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,922
- The bruise?
- It's nothing.

746
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:26,838
- Sir, let's blow-dry your hair.
- Okay.

747
00:57:35,755 --> 00:57:38,963
250 bucks for a shave? 250!

748
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:42,838
Madam, what's the cost
of cleaning the nails?

749
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:45,838
The luxury manicure is only 1000 bucks.

750
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:47,172
1000 bucks!

751
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,213
And whatever you're doing to him?

752
00:57:53,422 --> 00:57:54,880
- 1000 bucks without the tip.
- What!

753
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:58,463
Seher, before we go broke...

754
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:00,922
I need to talk to you
for just two minutes.

755
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:08,922
Uncle, have you lost your mind?

756
00:58:09,005 --> 00:58:10,963
Sorry! But what's all this?
Disgusting!

757
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,088
Uncle, this is a crime.

758
00:58:13,172 --> 00:58:14,838
You may not be aware...

759
00:58:14,922 --> 00:58:17,255
but what you've done
is a cyber crime.

760
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:18,338
You should know.

761
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,297
Child, a father and son chat
is led by emotions.

762
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,963
Please try to understand.

763
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:25,963
Stop trying to get us all sentimental!

764
00:58:26,213 --> 00:58:28,463
I'm going to call the police.

765
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:32,672
Just wait. Read this chat once.
Here's the username and password.

766
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:34,963
- Why should I read this rubbish?
- Exactly!

767
00:58:35,088 --> 00:58:36,547
Get out of here!

768
00:58:37,255 --> 00:58:38,880
We're not here to chat!

769
00:58:38,963 --> 00:58:40,172
We've work to do.

770
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,630
Don't think women are weak.

771
00:58:42,713 --> 00:58:43,755
That they can be harassed.

772
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:45,922
I'm telling you, we women
have reached the moon.

773
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:48,213
And we will go beyond.

774
00:58:48,297 --> 00:58:49,977
We'll go wherever we like
whenever we like.

775
00:58:50,047 --> 00:58:53,172
Gone are the days when
you married us off

776
00:58:53,255 --> 00:58:54,755
to make babies for all our lives...

777
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:57,380
Get out!

778
00:58:57,672 --> 00:59:01,505
- Stop bothering us!
- Come on, Mittal!

779
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,172
They're troubling us!

780
00:59:03,463 --> 00:59:04,838
"Read the chat," he says!

781
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:09,005
What's bothering you, Mathur?

782
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,505
I am scared.

783
00:59:12,088 --> 00:59:14,547
So is the Tara inside me.

784
00:59:16,547 --> 00:59:18,797
Both hopes lost at one go.

785
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,547
Type this...

786
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:25,005
Address it to Kabir.

787
00:59:25,505 --> 00:59:29,422
"I had my reasons...
for not recognizing you."

788
00:59:34,297 --> 00:59:35,547
Attend to your work.

789
00:59:45,297 --> 00:59:46,922
- Did he reply?
- Yes.

790
00:59:47,547 --> 00:59:50,963
Tara, you may have your reasons
not to recognize me.

791
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,463
But now I have my reasons to find you.

792
00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:55,588
And I will, at any cost!

793
00:59:56,005 --> 00:59:59,880
I saw you as the truth
which became a lie.

794
01:00:00,547 --> 01:00:02,963
We have to get this girl on our side.

795
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:05,880
Your son is in love.

796
01:00:06,505 --> 01:00:07,922
100% in love.

797
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,922
This one-sided love can destroy you.

798
01:00:11,588 --> 01:00:13,463
I have experienced it.

799
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:17,172
Let's go. Hurry!

800
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,880
Hey! Mind the shop.
I'll be back.

801
01:00:20,422 --> 01:00:22,338
I don't want to listen to anything!

802
01:00:22,422 --> 01:00:23,463
Don't you get it?

803
01:00:23,547 --> 01:00:24,463
This is where I work!

804
01:00:24,547 --> 01:00:28,463
I'll call security!
I'll call the police!

805
01:00:28,547 --> 01:00:30,588
Get out!

806
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,338
Return our aprons!

807
01:00:32,422 --> 01:00:35,588
Madam, please listen to me!

808
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:38,463
- Give back our aprons.
- Please, let me explain.

809
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:41,547
Spent so much in there.
Let us speak to her at least.

810
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,047
- No!
- Take your bloody frock!

811
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:45,672
- I just need two minutes with her!
- Mathur! Let's go!

812
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:47,797
What about the shit on our faces?

813
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,630
We'll wash it at home!

814
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,880
Sharma's got a gig for us.

815
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,880
I need to get back to him.

816
01:01:01,672 --> 01:01:02,713
Say something!

817
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,005
Grab the guy in the blue shirt!

818
01:01:10,547 --> 01:01:12,755
- What's your problem smarty pants?
- What the fuck!

819
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:15,547
Yes, sir.

820
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,130
Our band is called Darbaris.

821
01:01:17,213 --> 01:01:18,130
You sister-fucker!

822
01:01:18,213 --> 01:01:21,713
No, not you, sir.
Yes, sir. Okay.

823
01:01:21,797 --> 01:01:22,672
Kabir?

824
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:24,047
We play in the same band, sir.

825
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:28,380
How dare you kiss my GF!

826
01:01:28,463 --> 01:01:29,297
Interview?

827
01:01:29,463 --> 01:01:30,755
Just like your father!

828
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,297
Always fighting!

829
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:36,297
Got thrashed?
Or thrashed them too?

830
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:46,755
Seher, please open the door.

831
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:50,755
I swear, I'm sorry.

832
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:54,588
I made a mistake!
I didn't mean to hit you!

833
01:01:54,672 --> 01:01:57,797
Mistake?
I also kissed that guy by mistake!

834
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,630
Who kisses by mistake?

835
01:02:00,547 --> 01:02:02,297
Never happened to me!

836
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:03,755
You gotta be kidding!

837
01:02:03,797 --> 01:02:05,255
How does that even work?

838
01:02:05,338 --> 01:02:07,630
Show me.

839
01:02:08,547 --> 01:02:11,505
- Here, slap me. Slap me!
- Let me be!

840
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:15,505
Slap me!
But please forgive me.

841
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:18,797
What are you doing here?
Step aside!

842
01:02:18,963 --> 01:02:20,922
I need to talk to her!
Leave!

843
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:23,963
Seher, I didn't come here to be rude.

844
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:27,422
Let's party!
You'll feel better.

845
01:02:28,547 --> 01:02:29,630
I'll eat your finger!

846
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,297
Don't show me the middle finger!

847
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:33,130
Don't ever ask me for money again!

848
01:02:33,797 --> 01:02:35,547
Showing me the middle finger!

849
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,505
Here's a middle finger for you!

850
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,088
And another one!

851
01:02:43,172 --> 01:02:44,297
You know what you are?

852
01:02:44,922 --> 01:02:49,672
Remember the film where the guy calls his
business buddy a disgusting asshole?

853
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,047
That's what you are.
Gold digger!

854
01:02:52,213 --> 01:02:54,130
You're the epitome of disgusting!

855
01:02:55,255 --> 01:02:57,172
Guard, open the gate.

856
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,005
I've been waiting forever!

857
01:03:01,422 --> 01:03:03,713
Look who's here!

858
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:07,547
What do you know?
The kiddies are back!

859
01:03:09,338 --> 01:03:11,130
No one touches my car!

860
01:03:11,213 --> 01:03:13,922
If anything happens to my Audi
I'll lose control!

861
01:03:14,588 --> 01:03:16,963
Motherfucker!

862
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:18,713
I'll knock your sister up!

863
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:20,630
Bloody motherfucker!

864
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,005
Put the blanket over him!

865
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:25,713
Help! Mommy!

866
01:03:27,213 --> 01:03:28,713
That's Baljeet!

867
01:03:29,713 --> 01:03:32,630
And that guy whose song is trending.

868
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,588
Hit that swine one more time!
A couple more!

869
01:03:43,005 --> 01:03:44,713
Isn't this blackmail?

870
01:03:45,713 --> 01:03:47,047
First, I need the money.

871
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,213
And second...

872
01:03:49,713 --> 01:03:50,713
Uncle, look...

873
01:03:50,963 --> 01:03:55,172
who would do this for free
going out of their way?

874
01:03:56,755 --> 01:03:59,630
- How much?
- Just 50 grand for one meeting.

875
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:00,713
What!

876
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,713
50 grand for nothing?

877
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,588
Nothing? I read the entire chat.

878
01:04:06,172 --> 01:04:07,755
It's a royal mess!

879
01:04:08,088 --> 01:04:09,088
Okay, deal.

880
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:13,172
- But you must clean up the mess.
- Don't worry.

881
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:17,172
Our girl here is an expert
in these matters.

882
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:20,672
Cash or cheque?

883
01:04:20,755 --> 01:04:23,297
We don't want to end up paying tax.

884
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,755
- Cash!
- What!

885
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,672
Okay, we'll pay you tomorrow.

886
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:32,088
The thing is...
our singer is unwell.

887
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:41,713
We lost another gig.

888
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:43,880
Guys, we are musicians
not criminals.

889
01:04:45,755 --> 01:04:47,297
Why are we busy bashing people up?

890
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,755
Everything's fair in friendship.

891
01:04:50,713 --> 01:04:53,297
Son, anger is a bad thing.

892
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:56,338
It affects the melody.

893
01:04:58,338 --> 01:04:59,338
Yeah.

894
01:05:05,547 --> 01:05:08,630
Babaji, I've found my melody.

895
01:05:11,422 --> 01:05:12,630
<i>Metro Barakhamba?</i>

896
01:05:14,755 --> 01:05:17,047
That Baljeet has gone nuts!

897
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:30,922
May I call you tomorrow?

898
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:34,088
I'll confirm and let you know.

899
01:05:34,213 --> 01:05:35,797
Speak up.

900
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,005
- Shit! Run!
- But...

901
01:05:39,088 --> 01:05:42,338
- Kabir, what's going on?
- Don't stop! Hurry up!

902
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:43,922
Where are we going?

903
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:45,922
- Kabir!
- Where are you...

904
01:05:48,713 --> 01:05:49,838
Hurry up!

905
01:05:49,922 --> 01:05:51,047
What happened?

906
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:53,088
- What's going on?
- Excuse me!

907
01:05:53,172 --> 01:05:54,672
What's your problem!

908
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:56,963
Shut up and come with me!

909
01:05:58,005 --> 01:05:59,838
Who the hell are we running from?

910
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:01,755
- Come, come!
- Where?

911
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,297
Come!

912
01:06:09,172 --> 01:06:10,838
Who are we running from?

913
01:06:13,588 --> 01:06:14,838
Kabir? Kabir!

914
01:06:14,922 --> 01:06:16,838
Bye, Tara!

915
01:06:17,463 --> 01:06:18,463
Kabir!

916
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:20,547
<i>Now you know
how I felt that day</i>

917
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:22,255
<i>when you took me
for a spin and vanished.</i>

918
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:25,672
- Laughing at me, aren't you?
- This brat!

919
01:06:26,213 --> 01:06:27,047
Who?

920
01:06:27,213 --> 01:06:28,672
- Kabir!
- Why?

921
01:06:29,422 --> 01:06:32,338
He says, "Now you know
how I felt that day...

922
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:34,672
when you took me
for a spin and vanished."

923
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,088
This guy is fast.

924
01:06:36,672 --> 01:06:37,672
Paro!

925
01:06:37,922 --> 01:06:41,505
Girl, I don't like
where this is going.

926
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:45,338
- Type this.
- What?

927
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:47,547
"Tomorrow.
Your call, time and place."

928
01:06:47,797 --> 01:06:50,963
Get set for round three.

929
01:06:51,047 --> 01:06:53,047
<i>This time I'll wear sneakers.</i>

930
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,797
So why did you say
you're not on Facebook?

931
01:07:03,505 --> 01:07:05,213
I didn't want to meet you.

932
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,172
But here I am.

933
01:07:07,713 --> 01:07:08,713
I lied.

934
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:09,963
And...

935
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:11,922
why didn't you want to meet?

936
01:07:12,213 --> 01:07:15,130
I keep my social media
and real life apart.

937
01:07:16,422 --> 01:07:17,547
Who is that guy?

938
01:07:17,963 --> 01:07:23,380
The one you beat up under the blanket?

939
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,255
We saw it.

940
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:27,880
It was right outside our house.

941
01:07:27,963 --> 01:07:29,380
You really gave it to him.

942
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,213
He was a boyfriend type.

943
01:07:32,588 --> 01:07:34,463
You've broken up?

944
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:37,130
- That asshole hit me.
- Really?

945
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:38,255
Look!

946
01:07:45,672 --> 01:07:49,088
I kissed you that night.
He got jealous.

947
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:52,047
Then you shouldn't have.

948
01:07:52,297 --> 01:07:54,422
He was being clingy, my god!

949
01:07:54,922 --> 01:07:55,922
"Love you, baby!

950
01:07:58,005 --> 01:07:59,255
I wanted to piss him off.

951
01:08:03,797 --> 01:08:05,922
Want to ask anything else?

952
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:07,922
I did what you suggested.

953
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,755
- What?
- I left my house.

954
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,838
- Can I say something?
- Go ahead.

955
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:16,922
Why not go back to your father?

956
01:08:25,213 --> 01:08:27,463
We complicate things.

957
01:08:27,922 --> 01:08:30,088
Just talk it out.
It's that simple.

958
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:34,463
This causes more complications, Kabir.

959
01:08:37,797 --> 01:08:40,297
You are absolutely right!

960
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,463
I'm going to tell
my father straight out

961
01:08:43,547 --> 01:08:45,755
that I don't intend to
marry right now.

962
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,047
Shall we go? Come on.

963
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,422
We won't meet anymore.

964
01:08:55,963 --> 01:08:57,505
Just the Facebook Tara.

965
01:08:57,713 --> 01:08:59,797
But I find the real Tara
more interesting.

966
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:03,838
Run!

967
01:09:03,922 --> 01:09:04,963
Tara? Tara!

968
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:06,630
What's this?

969
01:09:06,963 --> 01:09:08,630
I like these girls.
Both of them.

970
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:17,505
- Shit! Baljeet!
- Was that baby?

971
01:09:18,672 --> 01:09:20,880
I have a black-eye
but why can't you see?

972
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:25,088
Dude, Kabir is a cool guy.

973
01:09:25,505 --> 01:09:27,505
He's different.

974
01:09:27,672 --> 01:09:28,922
Don't talk nonsense.

975
01:09:30,547 --> 01:09:33,963
Bitch! I've never seen you
pick up the bill for any other guy!

976
01:09:34,047 --> 01:09:35,130
- Right?
- Hey!

977
01:09:41,172 --> 01:09:42,297
- For you!
- No, thanks!

978
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,547
It's your father's poem.

979
01:09:44,088 --> 01:09:45,838
I turned it into a song.

980
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:54,547
Could you please play this?

981
01:10:03,005 --> 01:10:08,547
<i>Let me protect you</i>

982
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:12,463
<i>From the world</i>

983
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:15,505
<i>Come closer</i>

984
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:21,963
<i>Let me make you</i>

985
01:10:22,755 --> 01:10:25,588
<i>Feel special</i>

986
01:10:25,713 --> 01:10:29,047
<i>Come closer</i>

987
01:10:29,713 --> 01:10:35,838
<i>I couldn't bear</i>

988
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:40,922
<i>To see you cry</i>

989
01:10:42,922 --> 01:10:48,963
<i>Let me steal away every tear</i>

990
01:10:49,463 --> 01:10:54,588
<i>That ever came to your eye</i>

991
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:02,172
<i>Let me protect you</i>

992
01:11:02,838 --> 01:11:05,672
<i>From the world</i>

993
01:11:05,755 --> 01:11:09,547
<i>Come closer</i>

994
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,713
Please stop the song.

995
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:22,213
Why? It's so good.

996
01:11:24,005 --> 01:11:25,005
Yes, Uncle.

997
01:11:26,213 --> 01:11:28,213
Uncle this is Seher, not Tara.

998
01:11:29,338 --> 01:11:30,338
Yes, we met.

999
01:11:31,255 --> 01:11:32,547
No, nothing major.

1000
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:36,838
Uncle, I told him
we won't meet again.

1001
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:40,505
If we meet by accident,
I'll handle it.

1002
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,755
Good that she agreed to play along.

1003
01:11:44,338 --> 01:11:47,047
Thank God that
I don't lead this double life.

1004
01:11:47,255 --> 01:11:49,755
Playing Tara was tough.

1005
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,130
Tea for three.

1006
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,755
Not me.
Make it two.

1007
01:11:53,755 --> 01:11:55,297
Read this.
I don't have my glasses.

1008
01:11:55,838 --> 01:11:56,838
Who is it from?

1009
01:11:57,838 --> 01:11:58,838
Kabir.

1010
01:11:59,047 --> 01:12:03,380
Tara, your Facebook person pales
compared to the real Tara.

1011
01:12:03,547 --> 01:12:05,213
We must meet again.

1012
01:12:05,297 --> 01:12:07,338
- I propose round four.
- Damn!

1013
01:12:07,422 --> 01:12:09,255
That's called modern romance.

1014
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:12,672
Round four, no less!

1015
01:12:12,755 --> 01:12:16,547
I got it!
I'll pay her some more.

1016
01:12:17,172 --> 01:12:19,172
She can pretend to be in love

1017
01:12:19,255 --> 01:12:21,297
and bring Kabir home by Diwali.

1018
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,755
First, get him back to his music.

1019
01:12:24,797 --> 01:12:26,797
Second, get him
back home by Diwali.

1020
01:12:27,463 --> 01:12:28,838
He's my only son.

1021
01:12:29,922 --> 01:12:34,172
But... how can one
pretend to be in love?

1022
01:12:34,255 --> 01:12:37,172
You can, I know.

1023
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:40,672
Yes, Baljeet.

1024
01:12:41,755 --> 01:12:43,963
I owe you 25 grand, not 27.

1025
01:12:45,797 --> 01:12:47,255
Fine, do the math again.

1026
01:12:51,338 --> 01:12:54,838
Can you give me
something upfront?

1027
01:12:55,047 --> 01:12:56,922
The rest when it's done?

1028
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,130
Of course.

1029
01:12:58,505 --> 01:13:01,963
Take ten grand for now.

1030
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:05,463
The rest, when the job is done.

1031
01:13:06,922 --> 01:13:10,880
But I don't know if I can pull this off.

1032
01:13:12,963 --> 01:13:13,963
I have faith in you.

1033
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,422
So, Prankster?

1034
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,880
Yeah.

1035
01:13:23,755 --> 01:13:25,338
The food here is the best.

1036
01:13:27,255 --> 01:13:30,422
You sing so well!
I could fall in love.

1037
01:13:31,255 --> 01:13:33,172
Go ahead, fall in love.

1038
01:13:33,755 --> 01:13:34,755
Who's stopping you?

1039
01:13:36,547 --> 01:13:39,005
You need balls to fall in love.

1040
01:13:39,172 --> 01:13:40,380
I don't have them.

1041
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,130
I'm just a serial flirt.

1042
01:13:43,963 --> 01:13:45,547
So, you're getting married?

1043
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,963
My father wants me to, but...

1044
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:50,547
I got back from Canada
a couple of years ago.

1045
01:13:52,088 --> 01:13:54,255
Is this tattoo permanent?

1046
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,297
Yes, with a heart-wrenching story.

1047
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,588
Which I'm not telling.

1048
01:14:01,297 --> 01:14:02,297
Why the kiss?

1049
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:04,755
First, to show that I have the balls.

1050
01:14:04,963 --> 01:14:06,672
Second, to piss someone off.

1051
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,005
- Who?
- Baljeet.

1052
01:14:12,547 --> 01:14:14,755
Tara, stop running away.

1053
01:14:14,838 --> 01:14:17,130
- Tell him the truth.
- Let go!

1054
01:14:17,213 --> 01:14:19,755
Motherfucker!

1055
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:21,588
I'll bust your balls!

1056
01:14:21,672 --> 01:14:23,338
How dare you date him
while I'm around?

1057
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:26,047
You and I are completely different!

1058
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,797
What's this cozy twosome?

1059
01:14:29,922 --> 01:14:32,755
It was never you.
I fell for your fancy car.

1060
01:14:33,672 --> 01:14:34,797
You're lying!

1061
01:14:34,922 --> 01:14:36,880
You'll find a great girl one day.

1062
01:14:36,963 --> 01:14:38,213
Understood?

1063
01:14:39,047 --> 01:14:40,588
He didn't!
Listen, Seher.

1064
01:14:40,672 --> 01:14:41,713
No, you listen!

1065
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:46,297
You hit a woman again and
I'll smash your face!

1066
01:14:47,672 --> 01:14:49,338
I'll learn to play the guitar!
What else?

1067
01:14:49,422 --> 01:14:52,922
You'll teach me the guitar,
you bastard!

1068
01:14:58,047 --> 01:15:01,588
I can't believe your guitar
beat my high-speed Audi.

1069
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:05,547
I never saw it coming.

1070
01:15:06,755 --> 01:15:08,588
Brother, that's the problem.

1071
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:11,422
It is what's inside that is important.

1072
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:13,755
Not the biceps or the fancy cars.

1073
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:16,422
Come here.

1074
01:15:17,505 --> 01:15:18,880
It's really very simple.

1075
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:25,922
Keep your heart out
and your money in...

1076
01:15:30,963 --> 01:15:32,505
Uncle, I'll call you later.

1077
01:15:37,005 --> 01:15:38,797
You're like a brother to me.

1078
01:15:41,463 --> 01:15:43,547
Let me know if you ever need anything.

1079
01:15:55,338 --> 01:15:56,755
You didn't need to.

1080
01:15:58,088 --> 01:15:59,088
Seher...

1081
01:16:02,047 --> 01:16:03,672
Seher...

1082
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:22,797
<i>Don't know why</i>

1083
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,713
<i>The lines on your palms
Are now etched on mine</i>

1084
01:16:27,797 --> 01:16:31,922
<i>The words on my lips
Are always about you</i>

1085
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:34,338
<i>Don't know why</i>

1086
01:16:35,672 --> 01:16:41,838
<i>What is this? Why is this?
Surely you too think so</i>

1087
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:49,963
<i>Why are my mornings
Filled with your nights</i>

1088
01:16:50,755 --> 01:16:57,797
<i>If I don't see you, I feel
In some way, incomplete</i>

1089
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:05,797
<i>And my life is meaningless</i>

1090
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:13,630
<i>Meaningless!</i>

1091
01:17:17,547 --> 01:17:21,213
<i>Meaningless!</i>

1092
01:17:25,297 --> 01:17:29,088
<i>Meaningless!</i>

1093
01:17:37,588 --> 01:17:39,255
<i>Don't know why</i>

1094
01:17:39,338 --> 01:17:43,797
<i>The lines on your palms
Are now etched on mine</i>

1095
01:17:45,255 --> 01:17:49,672
<i>The words on my lips
Are always about you</i>

1096
01:17:49,755 --> 01:17:51,713
<i>Don't know why</i>

1097
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:45,630
<i>I am losing myself</i>

1098
01:18:48,463 --> 01:18:53,713
<i>Becoming like others</i>

1099
01:18:56,172 --> 01:19:03,047
<i>I get tangled</i>

1100
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:10,422
<i>In meaningless conversations</i>

1101
01:19:10,547 --> 01:19:13,172
<i>I feel empty</i>

1102
01:19:14,297 --> 01:19:17,213
<i>As I must seem to others</i>

1103
01:19:18,213 --> 01:19:25,213
<i>In some way, incomplete</i>

1104
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:36,713
<i>Meaningless!</i>

1105
01:19:40,755 --> 01:19:44,255
<i>Meaningless!</i>

1106
01:19:48,588 --> 01:19:51,172
Listen, I am curating a music festival.

1107
01:19:51,547 --> 01:19:53,922
I really want you guys
to perform there. Okay?

1108
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:05,463
<i>I get lost in meaningless conversations</i>

1109
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:09,505
<i>Even my dreams seem empty</i>

1110
01:20:09,588 --> 01:20:17,213
<i>When you're not around</i>

1111
01:20:17,297 --> 01:20:20,922
<i>I get lost in meaningless conversations</i>

1112
01:20:21,172 --> 01:20:24,797
<i>Even my dreams seem empty</i>

1113
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:31,797
<i>When you're not around</i>

1114
01:21:06,338 --> 01:21:07,463
Made a wish?

1115
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:09,922
For my family.

1116
01:21:10,547 --> 01:21:11,838
Diwali is round the corner.

1117
01:21:12,797 --> 01:21:14,422
I really miss my family.

1118
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:17,380
Diwali is always special.

1119
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,255
The whole family together!

1120
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:22,797
Fireworks and mom's food.

1121
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:25,797
Papa?

1122
01:21:27,213 --> 01:21:31,047
It's... Seher, Papa.

1123
01:21:33,713 --> 01:21:34,713
How are you?

1124
01:21:38,255 --> 01:21:39,463
I'm fine, too.

1125
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:46,255
Papa, I was thinking of
coming home for Diwali.

1126
01:21:51,255 --> 01:21:52,338
Okay, Papa.

1127
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,047
CHIRAG.

1128
01:22:05,797 --> 01:22:07,838
Ready to tell me
the heart wrenching story?

1129
01:22:18,422 --> 01:22:19,505
This is Chirag.

1130
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:23,106
I loved him, stole money from
my parents for him.

1131
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:24,172
Paid his fees.

1132
01:22:24,713 --> 01:22:25,838
What did I get in return?

1133
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:27,172
Betrayal.

1134
01:22:27,963 --> 01:22:30,088
He took me for a ride and
dumped me in a jiffy.

1135
01:22:31,755 --> 01:22:33,797
Then he ran away to Canada.

1136
01:22:34,588 --> 01:22:36,463
Is that why you left Meerut?

1137
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:44,963
Kabir, I was pregnant.

1138
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,380
I had no option but to run away.

1139
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,963
Big tummy in a small town?
Without marriage, no way!

1140
01:22:57,588 --> 01:22:59,505
I was betrayed by everyone around me.

1141
01:23:01,797 --> 01:23:04,005
Seen the Yamuna River bridge,
by the bus stand?

1142
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,297
I stood there, alone.

1143
01:23:06,838 --> 01:23:10,005
Suicide did cross my mind.

1144
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,797
I felt disgusted with myself.

1145
01:23:15,922 --> 01:23:17,880
Fought and reasoned with myself.

1146
01:23:19,213 --> 01:23:22,297
Then I went to a random clinic.

1147
01:23:23,338 --> 01:23:25,380
Gathered some courage...

1148
01:23:26,422 --> 01:23:28,005
and got an abortion.

1149
01:23:59,088 --> 01:24:01,380
It could have ruined my parents.

1150
01:24:02,797 --> 01:24:05,588
Discipline is all my father knows.

1151
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:08,588
He's a simple man.

1152
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,588
Should we go to Meerut for Diwali?

1153
01:24:13,922 --> 01:24:15,088
I'll come with you.

1154
01:24:16,755 --> 01:24:17,922
No. Everyone...

1155
01:24:21,963 --> 01:24:24,088
I called dad.
Told him I want to come.

1156
01:24:25,463 --> 01:24:27,963
He said they won't be home.

1157
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,172
He doesn't want me to return, Kabir.

1158
01:24:38,463 --> 01:24:39,880
Let's go to Old Delhi this Diwali.

1159
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:41,588
We'll celebrate with dad.

1160
01:24:42,547 --> 01:24:44,088
Let's celebrate together.

1161
01:25:03,922 --> 01:25:06,672
Wishing everyone
a very auspicious Diwali!

1162
01:25:06,755 --> 01:25:07,963
- Welcome!
- Happy Diwali!

1163
01:25:08,047 --> 01:25:09,130
Come, Dheela!

1164
01:25:10,547 --> 01:25:11,547
Let's go.

1165
01:25:15,172 --> 01:25:16,713
Happy Diwali.
God bless you.

1166
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,088
Go, get your blessings first.

1167
01:25:26,213 --> 01:25:27,963
Wait...

1168
01:25:28,047 --> 01:25:29,630
- How old are you?
- I am 62.

1169
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:31,231
You are my age and
you're touching my feet?

1170
01:25:31,255 --> 01:25:32,755
- Yes.
- Keep moving!

1171
01:25:38,797 --> 01:25:41,005
- Papa, this is Tara.
- Hello, Uncle.

1172
01:25:41,255 --> 01:25:43,005
I've got you a kurta.

1173
01:25:43,213 --> 01:25:44,463
Oh, lovely!

1174
01:25:44,922 --> 01:25:46,130
With your own money?

1175
01:25:46,838 --> 01:25:48,047
I am earning now, Papa.

1176
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:50,047
Our band is quite popular.

1177
01:25:50,172 --> 01:25:52,047
Let me just quickly put this on.

1178
01:25:52,255 --> 01:25:53,963
Come, let's go inside.

1179
01:26:06,672 --> 01:26:07,880
Anees Uncle...

1180
01:26:09,672 --> 01:26:12,463
this is for you. A kurta.

1181
01:26:12,797 --> 01:26:15,213
Thank you! Bless you!

1182
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:20,088
Kabir got this beautiful
silk kurta for me.

1183
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,547
Isn't it lovely?

1184
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:24,005
Kabir's got it for me. Cheers to that!

1185
01:26:30,588 --> 01:26:33,797
I love seeing you eat
<i>Rajma Chawal</i> with your hands.

1186
01:26:35,838 --> 01:26:37,463
Now tell me about your band.

1187
01:26:37,547 --> 01:26:39,838
It's going great, Papa.

1188
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,672
What's this?

1189
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,797
You're so beautiful.
Why this weird haircut?

1190
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,088
It looks good.

1191
01:26:48,172 --> 01:26:49,755
Yeah. It's a style.

1192
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:51,088
- No way!
- Yeah, exactly.

1193
01:26:51,213 --> 01:26:52,838
Come for our gig when you're free.

1194
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:54,672
Yes, of course!

1195
01:26:54,922 --> 01:26:56,797
Guys, help yourselves...

1196
01:27:00,422 --> 01:27:02,255
I'll be back, Papa.

1197
01:27:11,588 --> 01:27:13,588
What a firecracker!

1198
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:20,088
Bye, Papa. I'll keep visiting.

1199
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:43,963
Coming upstairs?

1200
01:27:45,922 --> 01:27:46,922
Paro?

1201
01:27:48,672 --> 01:27:52,172
She's visiting her parents for Diwali.

1202
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:58,297
Some other day.

1203
01:28:23,463 --> 01:28:25,047
Anup, get your ass inside!

1204
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:41,422
If I don't kiss you today
I'll regret it all my life.

1205
01:28:55,672 --> 01:28:57,797
- Sit!
- You sit, Uncle.

1206
01:28:59,213 --> 01:29:01,130
Which coffee should I order for you?

1207
01:29:01,338 --> 01:29:03,172
We'll do all that later.

1208
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,713
I had asked you for a small favour.

1209
01:29:06,172 --> 01:29:07,338
But you didn't deliver.

1210
01:29:07,672 --> 01:29:08,713
What?

1211
01:29:08,963 --> 01:29:10,213
Kabir never came back.

1212
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:13,213
I mean, not for good.

1213
01:29:14,005 --> 01:29:19,297
You're free to go now.
Let's end this drama.

1214
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:21,213
It's not a drama anymore.

1215
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,213
That's what I need to tell you.

1216
01:29:23,297 --> 01:29:24,547
How amazing!

1217
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:26,922
I asked you to put up an act.

1218
01:29:27,005 --> 01:29:28,213
You made it real.

1219
01:29:28,422 --> 01:29:29,422
I mean...

1220
01:29:29,547 --> 01:29:31,463
you and Kabir are completely different.

1221
01:29:32,172 --> 01:29:36,005
Please go your separate ways.

1222
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:39,463
But we love each other.

1223
01:29:39,797 --> 01:29:41,255
Please try and understand.

1224
01:29:42,713 --> 01:29:44,547
How much more money do you need?

1225
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:47,255
Oh, yes! I forgot your Diwali bonus!

1226
01:29:47,797 --> 01:29:49,755
Now the deal's over.

1227
01:29:50,797 --> 01:29:54,755
I was about to return all your money.

1228
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:57,255
You're an extremely fast girl.

1229
01:29:58,255 --> 01:29:59,797
Look at your appearance!

1230
01:30:00,422 --> 01:30:02,088
Kabir is a straight-forward guy.

1231
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:04,255
Don't be a nuisance.

1232
01:30:04,922 --> 01:30:06,255
Got it?

1233
01:30:10,047 --> 01:30:12,255
"Let me protect you from
the world, come closer.

1234
01:30:13,172 --> 01:30:15,255
Let me make you feel special, come closer.

1235
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,547
I couldn't bear to see you cry...

1236
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:19,710
help me steal away every
tear that came to your eye."

1237
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,838
You wrote this for your wife?

1238
01:30:25,005 --> 01:30:27,380
I don't believe you're capable of love.

1239
01:30:34,797 --> 01:30:36,797
Tara!

1240
01:30:37,672 --> 01:30:40,152
- Why aren't you answering my calls?
- Because I don't want to.

1241
01:30:40,213 --> 01:30:41,297
What do you mean?

1242
01:30:47,797 --> 01:30:49,838
I don't want to talk to you, Kabir!
Go away!

1243
01:30:50,005 --> 01:30:52,297
- Tara, what happened?
- I said go!

1244
01:30:56,172 --> 01:30:57,755
- What happened?
- Go!

1245
01:31:03,297 --> 01:31:04,338
Okay.

1246
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,130
You want to hear the truth?

1247
01:31:10,922 --> 01:31:12,797
I am bored of you.

1248
01:31:14,255 --> 01:31:17,172
You know that's how I am!

1249
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:19,797
Now, please go!

1250
01:31:28,838 --> 01:31:30,838
God knows what you're hiding this time!

1251
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:36,755
Kabir!

1252
01:31:36,963 --> 01:31:38,630
You know how easy it was?

1253
01:31:38,713 --> 01:31:41,380
I went home and told my father
that I don't want to get married.

1254
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:42,713
And he agreed.

1255
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:44,713
We complicate our lives unnecessarily!

1256
01:31:44,797 --> 01:31:46,047
It's actually so simple.

1257
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:52,213
Don't cry, child.

1258
01:31:52,297 --> 01:31:54,380
Come on, be brave.

1259
01:31:59,422 --> 01:32:00,880
I don't understand anymore.

1260
01:32:02,588 --> 01:32:04,838
Let's just pretend that
Tara never existed!

1261
01:32:06,005 --> 01:32:07,231
You found her on Facebook, right?

1262
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:08,380
Shut it down.

1263
01:32:08,672 --> 01:32:10,255
To hell with Tara!

1264
01:32:10,588 --> 01:32:12,463
Concentrate on your music.

1265
01:32:12,755 --> 01:32:15,380
Move on.
Live your life, son.

1266
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:18,755
Good boy.
Come on, don't cry.

1267
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:27,880
Son, love is a gift from God!

1268
01:32:28,213 --> 01:32:30,880
The world's changing.
So should you.

1269
01:32:30,963 --> 01:32:33,880
- Beeji, you won't understand.
- Son, you try and understand.

1270
01:32:34,088 --> 01:32:36,422
Don't interfere in my family matters!

1271
01:32:36,505 --> 01:32:38,255
Have you lost your mind?

1272
01:32:38,922 --> 01:32:40,422
Behave yourself!

1273
01:32:40,505 --> 01:32:41,922
Beeji, a cup of tea?

1274
01:32:42,005 --> 01:32:43,588
And you guys?

1275
01:32:43,672 --> 01:32:45,922
Shut the fuck up!
Who do you think you are?

1276
01:32:46,672 --> 01:32:47,713
Selfish bastard!

1277
01:32:47,797 --> 01:32:49,755
You've always been so!

1278
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:55,713
You think only we
should maintain friendship?

1279
01:32:55,797 --> 01:32:57,922
And you can offer us
tea whenever you like?

1280
01:32:58,672 --> 01:33:02,505
I kept saying, "Never mind! It's okay!"

1281
01:33:02,755 --> 01:33:04,922
Just to avoid confrontation.

1282
01:33:05,338 --> 01:33:06,338
And you...

1283
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,213
You will sit around and offer us tea?

1284
01:33:09,713 --> 01:33:10,755
You know what?

1285
01:33:11,338 --> 01:33:14,630
Drink that bloody tea by yourself.

1286
01:33:23,588 --> 01:33:26,922
Order some snacks to go with your tea.

1287
01:33:27,588 --> 01:33:29,672
Everyone is fast for you!

1288
01:33:29,755 --> 01:33:32,963
Only you and your son
are slow in the whole world?

1289
01:33:33,838 --> 01:33:35,380
Why are you so frustrated?

1290
01:33:35,463 --> 01:33:38,297
- Am I the frustrated one or you?
- Shut up!

1291
01:33:38,463 --> 01:33:40,547
That girl took control of your son.

1292
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:41,963
That's why you got jealous!

1293
01:33:42,213 --> 01:33:45,088
How did she achieve what
you couldn't as his father?

1294
01:33:45,172 --> 01:33:46,963
Shut up!

1295
01:33:47,047 --> 01:33:50,172
You begged me to do business with you.

1296
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:51,838
Ever had a look in the mirror?

1297
01:33:51,922 --> 01:33:54,255
The truth is that I did not
want to do business with you.

1298
01:33:54,338 --> 01:33:55,463
That's why I declined.

1299
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,922
So, who is frustrated?
You or me?

1300
01:33:59,713 --> 01:34:01,005
Talking nonsense!

1301
01:34:04,797 --> 01:34:05,797
That's it.

1302
01:34:06,505 --> 01:34:08,005
I'm done with you.

1303
01:34:08,088 --> 01:34:09,172
Go fuck yourself!

1304
01:34:15,297 --> 01:34:18,088
Let's leave, Beeji.
It's time for your TV soap.

1305
01:34:18,172 --> 01:34:19,172
Let's go.

1306
01:34:20,547 --> 01:34:21,838
They don't even have a TV.

1307
01:34:21,922 --> 01:34:23,713
Can't expect them
to have feelings, can we?

1308
01:35:18,422 --> 01:35:21,297
Seher, working so late?
Let's leave.

1309
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,880
I need to make money, Paro.

1310
01:35:24,172 --> 01:35:25,588
Borrowed money is poison.

1311
01:35:26,422 --> 01:35:27,880
Seher...

1312
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:34,963
<i>I am with you...</i>

1313
01:35:35,047 --> 01:35:39,755
<i>Always by your side</i>

1314
01:35:43,172 --> 01:35:44,880
What's happened to your leader?

1315
01:35:48,088 --> 01:35:49,963
<i>Tell Kabir to call me urgently.</i>

1316
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,963
<i>In sunlight</i>

1317
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:59,130
<i>In rain</i>

1318
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:05,047
<i>In victory</i>

1319
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,588
<i>In pain</i>

1320
01:36:12,172 --> 01:36:17,172
<i>In everything that you ever think
Or do</i>

1321
01:36:17,463 --> 01:36:20,630
<i>Somewhere between
Knowing and feeling</i>

1322
01:36:20,713 --> 01:36:23,172
<i>I am with you</i>

1323
01:36:27,922 --> 01:36:28,963
What's this?

1324
01:36:29,547 --> 01:36:30,547
The money I owe you.

1325
01:36:32,922 --> 01:36:33,922
Really?

1326
01:36:37,088 --> 01:36:39,172
I had called you disgusting, right?

1327
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:44,130
You know, you are not
even the "D" of disgusting.

1328
01:36:54,922 --> 01:36:55,922
Seher...

1329
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:01,922
I finished the beginner's guitar lessons.

1330
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,547
This is what's disgusting!

1331
01:37:15,005 --> 01:37:18,838
Anupji, Auntie...
I can't afford living here.

1332
01:37:19,297 --> 01:37:20,713
I'm moving to a hostel.

1333
01:37:21,088 --> 01:37:22,172
Don't worry.

1334
01:37:23,255 --> 01:37:24,255
Sanju?

1335
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,130
Back in time.
I was about to leave.

1336
01:37:26,338 --> 01:37:28,838
- What happened?
- Uncle, please talk to Kabir.

1337
01:37:28,963 --> 01:37:30,523
The music festival called again.
They're getting impatient.

1338
01:37:30,547 --> 01:37:32,213
Might cancel the show.

1339
01:37:32,422 --> 01:37:33,713
Kabir is unable to sing.

1340
01:37:34,672 --> 01:37:36,255
I don't know what to do.

1341
01:37:37,672 --> 01:37:38,672
I'll talk to him.

1342
01:38:20,797 --> 01:38:21,797
Boss!

1343
01:38:22,963 --> 01:38:24,005
- Papa!
- Boss!

1344
01:38:24,088 --> 01:38:25,297
My chest is hurting!

1345
01:38:25,505 --> 01:38:28,088
- Anees Uncle!
- Is this a heart attack?

1346
01:38:28,547 --> 01:38:29,588
Kuljeet Uncle!

1347
01:38:29,672 --> 01:38:32,297
Kuljeet!

1348
01:38:35,422 --> 01:38:37,005
Is he okay, Doctor?

1349
01:38:37,088 --> 01:38:38,213
How is he?

1350
01:38:38,838 --> 01:38:40,130
He's okay now, resting.

1351
01:38:40,297 --> 01:38:42,213
- Heart attack?
- Yes.

1352
01:38:42,755 --> 01:38:44,172
You brought him in time.

1353
01:38:44,463 --> 01:38:47,130
Anger affects health.
He should cool down.

1354
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:48,922
Don't worry about the money.

1355
01:38:49,088 --> 01:38:50,797
It's no problem.

1356
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,088
You guys should go.
Come tomorrow. Okay?

1357
01:38:54,338 --> 01:38:56,213
- Go in.
- You can go in, son.

1358
01:38:56,547 --> 01:38:57,755
Go see your dad.

1359
01:38:58,005 --> 01:38:59,255
Don't talk too much.

1360
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:22,255
What's this, Papa?

1361
01:39:23,005 --> 01:39:24,255
Come back home.

1362
01:39:26,338 --> 01:39:29,213
Why don't you look after yourself?

1363
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:31,255
Please don't be so stubborn.

1364
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:33,505
You don't let anyone take care of you.

1365
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,713
Even mom's not with us now.

1366
01:39:42,255 --> 01:39:44,213
Don't cry, my child.

1367
01:39:47,547 --> 01:39:49,713
I'll be fine, my son.

1368
01:39:51,005 --> 01:39:52,713
Don't worry.

1369
01:39:54,588 --> 01:39:56,213
You get yourself together.

1370
01:39:57,255 --> 01:39:58,963
Stop crying now.

1371
01:40:04,547 --> 01:40:06,963
I'm sorry to be this way.

1372
01:40:07,338 --> 01:40:09,047
All I know is that I love you, Papa.

1373
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,047
Beyond everything else!

1374
01:40:14,088 --> 01:40:15,463
Kabir...

1375
01:40:16,922 --> 01:40:18,422
let your father rest now.

1376
01:40:18,963 --> 01:40:20,047
You need some rest too.

1377
01:40:21,547 --> 01:40:23,588
Let me stay a little longer.

1378
01:40:24,047 --> 01:40:25,588
Sorry, but this is the ICU.

1379
01:40:26,338 --> 01:40:28,963
Come back during the visiting hours.

1380
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:31,380
Don't worry, I'll be here.

1381
01:40:38,588 --> 01:40:39,588
God bless.

1382
01:40:49,672 --> 01:40:51,880
- I need to return this money.
- Tara?

1383
01:40:52,172 --> 01:40:53,172
Hold on!

1384
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:54,255
Let's go!

1385
01:40:54,338 --> 01:40:55,755
- Where are you going?
- Go away!

1386
01:40:55,838 --> 01:40:57,172
- Listen!
- Leave me alone!

1387
01:41:00,297 --> 01:41:02,088
- What was she doing here?
- Nothing.

1388
01:41:02,172 --> 01:41:03,398
- What are you hiding there?
- Nothing.

1389
01:41:03,422 --> 01:41:05,005
- What is it?
- It's nothing!

1390
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,130
- What's this?
- It's nothing.

1391
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,963
- What's this?
- Kabir, your father really loves you.

1392
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,963
You're such a drama queen.

1393
01:41:15,422 --> 01:41:17,172
I'll lose my medical
license because of you.

1394
01:41:17,463 --> 01:41:19,630
I've made a huge mistake.

1395
01:41:19,838 --> 01:41:23,130
- What now?
- I realized how much my son loves me.

1396
01:41:23,588 --> 01:41:25,130
You saw how he wept
and held on to me?

1397
01:41:25,213 --> 01:41:27,630
Let's end this drama.
I'm out of here!

1398
01:41:27,797 --> 01:41:30,130
Easy. Careful!

1399
01:41:30,338 --> 01:41:33,130
Let me out!
Bring me my clothes.

1400
01:41:33,922 --> 01:41:36,922
Mathur, at least change your clothes.
You can't walk out like this.

1401
01:41:37,047 --> 01:41:40,088
I can't let that girl leave!
Kabir will be shattered.

1402
01:41:40,172 --> 01:41:42,588
- It's really cold outside.
- Doesn't matter.

1403
01:41:42,672 --> 01:41:44,755
Thank you, madam, for the jersey...

1404
01:41:44,838 --> 01:41:45,672
Sir?

1405
01:41:45,755 --> 01:41:47,963
- That's my jersey!
- I'll return it.

1406
01:41:49,838 --> 01:41:52,547
Mathur, hang on! I'll go with you.

1407
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:54,047
Shut up, Dheela!

1408
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:55,172
Rickshaw!

1409
01:41:55,255 --> 01:41:56,797
- No way!
- Rickshaw!

1410
01:41:56,922 --> 01:41:58,130
I don't want to hear anything!

1411
01:41:58,213 --> 01:41:59,588
I'm sick of his lies!

1412
01:41:59,672 --> 01:42:01,338
- Enough!
- Kabir, please!

1413
01:42:01,422 --> 01:42:02,713
- Boss?
- What happened?

1414
01:42:03,005 --> 01:42:04,314
- What happened?
- To hell with you all!

1415
01:42:04,338 --> 01:42:06,213
Kabir, listen!

1416
01:42:06,338 --> 01:42:09,172
- Boss!
- I was just pretending!

1417
01:42:09,422 --> 01:42:11,672
- You're unwell!
- Didn't he have a heart attack?

1418
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:13,773
It was no heart attack.
But he could get one now.

1419
01:42:13,797 --> 01:42:14,963
Boss, I made a mistake.

1420
01:42:15,047 --> 01:42:16,672
I told him about the whole Tara thing.

1421
01:42:19,838 --> 01:42:22,547
He found out about the deal,
we're screwed!

1422
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:23,713
- Kabir, stop!
- Kabir!

1423
01:42:25,505 --> 01:42:26,505
What happened?

1424
01:42:29,963 --> 01:42:33,213
He must have gone to Seher, I mean, Tara.

1425
01:42:37,713 --> 01:42:38,880
This way or that way?

1426
01:42:38,963 --> 01:42:39,963
Have you seen Kabir?

1427
01:42:40,047 --> 01:42:43,422
No, Uncle, but I tried calling Seher!
She's not answering my calls.

1428
01:42:43,672 --> 01:42:45,672
She's moved to a girl's hostel.

1429
01:42:47,005 --> 01:42:48,797
- Take us over there.
- Let's go.

1430
01:42:48,963 --> 01:42:50,213
Out of the way!

1431
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:52,505
Anees! Where is Mittal?

1432
01:42:52,588 --> 01:42:54,630
- No idea.
- Go fetch him.

1433
01:42:55,213 --> 01:42:57,338
- How much money did you lose?
- Four.

1434
01:42:57,422 --> 01:42:58,338
Four million?

1435
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,630
Kabir! What's the matter?

1436
01:43:00,713 --> 01:43:01,713
Wait, son!

1437
01:43:01,922 --> 01:43:04,213
Mathur's son is such a...

1438
01:43:04,422 --> 01:43:05,338
- Mittal!
- Yes?

1439
01:43:05,422 --> 01:43:07,213
Kabir has run away!

1440
01:43:07,422 --> 01:43:10,672
- He just went this way
- What are you saying!

1441
01:43:10,755 --> 01:43:12,588
It all started with Mathur's heart attack.

1442
01:43:12,672 --> 01:43:15,838
Let's rush to that hostel.
Some girl's hostel, ladies' hostel!

1443
01:43:16,005 --> 01:43:17,588
Let's go!

1444
01:43:17,672 --> 01:43:19,380
Do you know the way?

1445
01:43:19,505 --> 01:43:21,255
Call Kuljeet.

1446
01:43:24,797 --> 01:43:25,797
Watchman!

1447
01:43:26,047 --> 01:43:27,338
- Watchman!
- Open up!

1448
01:43:27,463 --> 01:43:28,463
Anyone there?

1449
01:43:28,588 --> 01:43:29,588
Open the gate!

1450
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:32,838
We have to meet
Seher Chowdhary urgently.

1451
01:43:32,922 --> 01:43:34,588
Sir, it's past visiting hours.

1452
01:43:34,672 --> 01:43:35,922
What do you mean?

1453
01:43:36,005 --> 01:43:37,213
Open!

1454
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,255
There are cameras everywhere.
I'll lose my job!

1455
01:43:41,338 --> 01:43:43,672
- Look!
- Madam's here!

1456
01:43:43,797 --> 01:43:45,463
Let's go in.

1457
01:43:45,547 --> 01:43:46,755
Uncle, no!

1458
01:43:47,963 --> 01:43:49,297
My job is at risk!

1459
01:43:53,713 --> 01:43:55,130
Wait! You can't just barge in!

1460
01:43:55,255 --> 01:43:56,088
It's a girl's hostel.

1461
01:43:56,172 --> 01:43:57,755
We need to see
Seher Chowdhary urgently!

1462
01:43:57,880 --> 01:43:59,088
It's not the visiting hours!

1463
01:43:59,172 --> 01:44:00,713
We don't have time!

1464
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,713
I'm a heart patient! I...

1465
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,680
Seher Chowdhary,
they're calling you urgently.

1466
01:44:18,130 --> 01:44:19,047
She's here.

1467
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:20,963
- Uncle?
- Seher!

1468
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,672
First, I am so sorry for everything.

1469
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,130
What I did was horrible.

1470
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:29,922
Kabir's missing.

1471
01:44:30,172 --> 01:44:31,172
Do you know where he is?

1472
01:44:32,297 --> 01:44:33,922
I have no clue.

1473
01:44:34,005 --> 01:44:35,172
She doesn't know.

1474
01:44:35,422 --> 01:44:37,130
- Think, Seher.
- Wait a second.

1475
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:41,297
He installed an app,
Find a Friend, on my phone.

1476
01:44:45,755 --> 01:44:46,588
Here.

1477
01:44:46,672 --> 01:44:48,672
Dwarka Metro Station!

1478
01:44:48,797 --> 01:44:50,172
Let's get moving!

1479
01:44:50,255 --> 01:44:51,297
Let's go!

1480
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:58,380
Where is he?

1481
01:44:58,505 --> 01:45:02,630
I don't know.
I've lost the network.

1482
01:45:06,505 --> 01:45:07,713
No network?

1483
01:45:09,255 --> 01:45:11,672
Let's split up. There are three platforms.

1484
01:45:12,172 --> 01:45:15,213
You on 1. Myself on 2.
You on 3.

1485
01:45:15,547 --> 01:45:16,380
Okay?

1486
01:45:16,547 --> 01:45:17,672
You look after Beeji.

1487
01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:20,672
Beeji, let's wait here.

1488
01:45:22,797 --> 01:45:24,547
Uncle, there!

1489
01:45:29,422 --> 01:45:30,963
Go talk to him.

1490
01:45:46,838 --> 01:45:47,838
Please, don't run.

1491
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:49,172
Stop running.

1492
01:45:50,088 --> 01:45:51,547
Not from me or yourself.

1493
01:45:51,797 --> 01:45:52,797
Sit down.

1494
01:45:55,672 --> 01:45:57,338
I don't want to talk to you.

1495
01:45:58,172 --> 01:46:00,088
Please, tell me something new.

1496
01:46:00,672 --> 01:46:03,963
Like, "I have so much to tell you."

1497
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:08,963
Then even I'll be surprised for a change.

1498
01:46:11,963 --> 01:46:13,963
Your mom met with an accident.

1499
01:46:14,547 --> 01:46:17,630
She told me it was minor
and that I shouldn't tell you.

1500
01:46:17,797 --> 01:46:20,088
Because you had your final year exams.

1501
01:46:20,255 --> 01:46:21,255
So, better not...

1502
01:46:25,088 --> 01:46:27,130
She threw up the whole night.

1503
01:46:28,797 --> 01:46:31,547
By morning, she was gone.

1504
01:46:33,505 --> 01:46:35,213
It was your mother who lied to me.

1505
01:46:35,588 --> 01:46:37,255
And you made me the liar!

1506
01:46:41,547 --> 01:46:43,588
I never told you about
the house because...

1507
01:46:45,255 --> 01:46:49,005
sometimes you lack the courage to
share your failure with your children.

1508
01:46:50,463 --> 01:46:54,005
I tried so many times
but I couldn't do so.

1509
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:59,380
We both lost the person
who had kept us together.

1510
01:47:02,005 --> 01:47:03,755
What she left behind was...

1511
01:47:04,547 --> 01:47:09,713
your anger, your loneliness, bitterness...

1512
01:47:11,005 --> 01:47:14,797
When I ran out of all options...

1513
01:47:15,963 --> 01:47:18,672
I created Tara's profile
to chat with you.

1514
01:47:28,547 --> 01:47:30,297
I got left behind, son.

1515
01:47:31,672 --> 01:47:35,588
You had moved a long way.

1516
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:39,672
I made a mistake, son.

1517
01:47:40,088 --> 01:47:41,297
A huge mistake.

1518
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,297
Behind all this is my love.

1519
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:47,422
I was just unable to tell you so.

1520
01:47:49,297 --> 01:47:52,797
Because I never learned
to express love with words.

1521
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:56,338
I don't know how...

1522
01:48:02,672 --> 01:48:04,255
It was my mistake.

1523
01:48:17,297 --> 01:48:19,005
- There they are!
- What a sight!

1524
01:48:22,005 --> 01:48:23,713
Congratulations!

1525
01:48:29,297 --> 01:48:31,130
God bless you, my child.

1526
01:48:33,172 --> 01:48:35,713
- Now you can talk to us, right?
- Where is Seher?

1527
01:48:35,797 --> 01:48:39,338
She took the last train and
left this message for you.

1528
01:48:40,338 --> 01:48:41,463
What does it say?

1529
01:48:42,255 --> 01:48:45,547
I've brought Kabir back home, forever.

1530
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:52,130
It took me a while to understand Seher...

1531
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:54,088
but she is your truth.

1532
01:48:54,963 --> 01:48:55,963
Don't lose her.

1533
01:48:56,463 --> 01:48:57,755
Go get her.

1534
01:48:58,297 --> 01:48:59,338
Go.

1535
01:48:59,755 --> 01:49:01,588
- Go on!
- Go on, son!

1536
01:49:01,672 --> 01:49:04,838
- Godspeed, son!
- Go, Kabir!

1537
01:49:07,547 --> 01:49:09,588
- Go!
- Be careful!

1538
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:31,755
I'm Kabir.

1539
01:49:33,047 --> 01:49:35,755
This is your last chance.
Tell me your truth.

1540
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:17,047
<i>Friendship is what marks my
Neighbourhood and its lanes</i>

1541
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:20,463
<i>Inseparable, we walk together</i>

1542
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:24,255
<i>The bonds here,
Varied as threads in fabrics</i>

1543
01:50:24,338 --> 01:50:27,630
<i>That dress these streets</i>

1544
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:31,755
<i>That's how it goes, how it flows</i>

1545
01:50:31,838 --> 01:50:35,255
<i>Proclaiming it all to the world</i>

1546
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:39,047

1547
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:42,255
