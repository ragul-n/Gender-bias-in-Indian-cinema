2
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,907
Hey Romeo,
this isn't your aunt's house.

3
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,812
Either sit properly or get lost.

4
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,453
You're doing romance openly!

5
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,511
It tickles the
mood of the people like us who watch you.

6
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,420
Get out of here!

7
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,958
- Sukhi!
- Yes, master?

8
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,686
Master? Did I teach
you how to play the flute?

9
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,523
Take money from
them and ask them to leave.

10
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,062
Hello.. Romeo & Juliet.

11
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,822
Vacate the table. You have
been here since past one hour.

12
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,595
Give someone else a chance.

13
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,828
I don't understand these girls.

14
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,869
How do these beautiful
girls end up with such idiots?

15
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,532
They don't look at
their personality..

16
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,042
They just fall for
their "borrowed" Yamahas.

17
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,072
Girls fall for the heart, bro.

18
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,314
Have a good heart and
everything else is forgiven.

19
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,576
Yamaha or my Yezdi doesn't
make a difference then.

20
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,347
You too have hooked up
with such a beautiful girl?

21
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,318
What do you mean by hooked up?

22
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,756
Stupid monkey...!!

23
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,089
Learn to respect women, will you?

24
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,656
The term you should use is "set".

25
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,989
Wow...!!

26
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,726
Look at your thoughts
about the womankind...!!

27
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:44,324
I have never seen
you around here before...

28
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,063
But you're a smooth talker.

29
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,601
Sukhi, set up a glass for me too.

30
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,639
Ok boss..

31
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,673
You are shameless.
You'll drink 'borrowed' liquor?

32
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,733
Borrowed?

33
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,109
I think you are very warm person.

34
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,406
I'm sure you would offer me..

35
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,452
And that too so politely
that I won't be able to refuse.

36
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,645
Pour me a drink.

37
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,881
Not just shameless, you're sleazy also...!!

38
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,991
What is it? You look so angry.

39
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,923
Did your wife throw you out?

40
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,325
I'll hit you with the bottle now.

41
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,424
You should show respect to
the one who offers you free drinks.

42
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:15,864
Forget it.

43
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,837
Tell me, how beautiful is
the girl you have hooked up with?

44
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,837
So not just shameless & sleazy,
you're vulgar also.

45
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,343
Stupid monkey.

46
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,409
So you were asking me about her beauty?

47
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,047
Yes. How beautiful is she?

48
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:39,052
Now what should I tell you about her..

49
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,620
She is so beautiful that
if you look at her once..

50
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:47,526
...you will set your Dhaba
on fire..

51
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,726
...and jump into the river and die.

52
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,869
Her beauty oozes off as Limca does,
when you add a pinch of salt in it.

53
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,644
When she walks wearing
those high heels..

54
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,480
...the floor too beats
like a lover's heart.

55
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,361
My beloved is just like fire.

56
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,037
And when she starts to speak,
you know what does she say?

57
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,068
What?

58
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,669
India is an under insured country...

59
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,007
People spend Lakhs
on their car's insurance.

60
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,672
...but they hesitate to spend
Thousands on their life insurance.

61
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,977
But people don't
understand this, ma'am.

62
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,847
No one is ready to buy policies.

63
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,786
Then stop selling the policies.

64
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,650
What?

65
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,053
I mean, this is where we go wrong.

66
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,484
We start selling the
policy from the word go.

67
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,992
Don't tell them what are
the benefits of buying a policy.

68
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,965
Tell them what they will
lose if they don't buy a policy.

69
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,457
Scare them...!!

70
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,029
Selling policies is an art.

71
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,272
Let me show you.

72
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,572
Who is this?

73
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,691
Excuse me?

74
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,855
Hello, mister.

75
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:26,786
Mister!

76
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:35,295
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

77
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,038
The entire class is quiet.

78
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,637
We can only hear
you snoring in the room.

79
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,804
A Jatt always roars alone.

80
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,710
- No tea as yet?
- Okay.

81
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,072
Look at your watch.

82
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,408
It's 2:30 pm.

83
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,945
Really?

84
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,010
I must have taken
my afternoon nap then.

85
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,755
But I was getting dreams
like I get in the night.

86
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,552
What?

87
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,950
Wise guys say its
morning whenever you wake up.

88
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,390
- So good morning, madam.
- Shut up.

89
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,090
And which wise guy told you
to sleep during an ongoing lecture?

90
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:04,333
What a joke.. I'm that much wise myself.

91
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,632
I never heard any lectures in college,
when I used to pay the fees for it.

92
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,331
Here you are giving one for free.

93
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,464
Shut up and get out of the room.

94
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,971
Get out.

95
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,536
Ma'am seems hot-tempered.

96
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,636
She doesn't like jokes at all.

97
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,010
Leave. Go.

98
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:20,639
Okay

99
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:24,783
Okay now tell me,
who sold the most policies this year?

100
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,888
Go on, tell me.

101
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,493
- You didn't leave?
- I had left, ma'am.

102
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,764
But the thought of my office's
honor brought me back.

103
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:36,925
You are blabbering.

104
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,300
They don't have the reply
to the question you asked.

105
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,431
Actually, I am the one..

106
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,742
...who has sold the
maximum number of policies.

107
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,841
Have you seen your face in the mirror?

108
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,643
Face? I've to go sell polices
and not seek marriage proposals.

109
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,482
But those who buy the
polices do often ask..

110
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,918
"Son, are you married or do you
want us to set you up with someone?"

111
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,716
What a joke...!!

112
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,756
Silence.

113
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,883
Ma'am, he is telling the truth.

114
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,257
He is the highest premium collector.

115
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,488
You'll have to accept ma'am..

116
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:09,328
...this Ambarsariya hasn't spared
anyone from Rajpura till Devigarh.

117
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,267
Rickshaw!

118
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,745
Jasleen madam, you still haven't left?

119
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,546
I am waiting for a rickshaw.

120
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,279
You are waiting for
a rickshaw when I am here?

121
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,049
You won't go in a rickshaw.

122
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,822
Ambarsariya!
Come here.

123
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,553
Drop her to the bus stop.

124
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:40,056
- He will drop you.
- No, sir. <i>l'll</i> manage.

125
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,060
No, madam.
What are you saying?

126
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,360
You came to Patiala all the
way from Amritsar to teach my team.

127
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,031
I too have some
responsibility towards you.

128
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,603
Hurry UP-

129
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,803
Make sure she gets into the bus.
- Okay, sir.

130
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,606
Hop on.

131
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,675
Hurry up.

132
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,546
Madam, this isn't your class
that your orders will be followed.

133
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,783
Get down and push it.

134
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,984
- You want me to push it?
- Yes.

135
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,920
Couldn't you say that
in front of Bajwa sir?

136
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,258
I bought it second-hand from
Bajwa sir only, it a push-start.

137
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:12,989
Push it.

138
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,698
I cannot push it. I am wearing high heels.

139
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,630
You can wear my boots for some time.

140
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,964
But it won't work without a push.

141
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:20,927
I think you should
take the decision quickly..

142
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,301
...or else you will miss your bus.

143
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,806
Then you will have to
take a lift from a truck.

144
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,865
And you know how cooperative
the truck drivers are.

145
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,683
Ok.. Fine.

146
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,777
But not all truck
drivers are that bad.

147
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,515
My aunt's son is a transporter.

148
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,851
He is so sweet.

149
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,350
Sweet! What a joke!

150
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,358
Madam, then he must
be having an Innova.

151
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,452
Truck drivers aren't just sweet.

152
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,964
They're sweet & sour.. men of honour...!!

153
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,732
I suggest you push it.

154
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,833
Go ahead.

155
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,299
What a joke..

156
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,969
Almost done.

157
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,047
- Can't you drive faster?
- No.

158
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,509
You don't have any manners.

159
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:11,753
Yes, none at all.

160
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:13,956
Idiot...!!

161
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,015
Same to you.

162
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,688
Okay, bye.

163
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,762
I get a lot of phone calls.

164
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,398
So, say something.
Why aren't you talking...?

165
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:29,965
You sell the maximum policies
and yet you drive this milkman's bike.

166
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,706
Milkman's? I didn't ask you
sit by placing your legs on both side.

167
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,675
You should respect something
that helps you when in need.

168
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,645
I suggest you get conformable
and enjoy the long drive.

169
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,013
Long drive on this?

170
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,814
Yes, it takes 10 minutes
to reach the bus stop usually.

171
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,616
But on my Yezdi it takes 20 minutes.

172
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,514
So it ends up being a long drive,
doesn't it?

173
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,114
What a joke.

174
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,018
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello, son. Welcome.

175
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:55,456
Give me two kilos of each
veggies of whose prices have reduced.

176
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,968
- Right <i>away,</i> son.
- I am already late and you have stopped here.

177
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,334
Can't we hurry up? Please.

178
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,770
Madam, one works for bread.

179
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,568
And one cannot eat
bread without the veggies.

180
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,904
We will leave after
I take the veggies.

181
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,501
And don't say please to me.

182
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,512
I don't like anyone begging me like this.

183
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,909
Especially the ladies staff.

184
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,971
- Son!
- Yes.

185
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,415
- Here are your veggies.
- Hold these.

186
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,451
Here.

187
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,618
Son, here's this month's premium.

188
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,085
- Take this as well.
- Thank you.

189
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,347
Sit.

190
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,853
How do I with these
packets in my hands?

191
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,721
What a joke! Now it's the
time for your milkman's style.

192
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,061
- Can't you drive faster?
- Of course, I can.

193
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,872
- But I won't because you have asked me to.
- Why?

194
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,103
To have cold food, to take hot showers
and to never get wheedled by girls.

195
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,539
Ambarsariya Jatt lives by this mantra

196
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:47,981
Actually, this is entirely
your fault that we're late

197
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,753
It's the fault of the Cobra Perfume
that you're wearing.. I'm smitten by it.

198
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,416
Here's your bus stop.

199
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,491
Oh no.. My bus left.

200
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,690
It's not a problem.
Take some other bus.

201
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:02,892
There are many buses
that go to Amritsar.

202
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,559
This was the last AC bus.

203
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,329
What do you need AC bus for..

204
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,531
One can never enjoy
the journey in an AC bus.

205
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,733
They don't have any
stoppage for food or drinks.

206
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,503
One gets bored in it.

207
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,601
Look, the government bus is here.

208
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,441
I suggest you should buy
some peanuts and get on it.

209
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,983
Peel and eat them.
And throw the shells out.

210
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:20,744
Enjoy it.

211
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,581
You won't even realize
when you reached Amritsar.

212
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,848
Stop your nonsense. Here are you bags.

213
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,480
Stupid guy.

214
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:32,493
Huh? Get in.
Remove your high heel sandals.

215
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,521
Push a little.

216
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,628
Get close to the auntie in blue.
Otherwise she will grab your seat.

217
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,804
Sit down. Sit down.

218
00:12:42,694 --> 00:12:45,766
Buy a ticket for Jalandhar
and get down at PAP Chowk.

219
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,809
It will save half an hour.

220
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,903
I will meet you once
I am in Amritsar.

221
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:54,542
Don't you dare to call yourself
Ambarsariya or show me your face again!!

222
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:57,109
I will break your face
if you ever enter Amritsar.

223
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,380
I will have your posters
pasted in Jandiala..

224
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,790
...asking people to break your legs if
they see you coming towards Amritsar.

225
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,953
Break his bones.

226
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,294
Stupid crazy, ill-mannered idiot!

227
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,066
She has lost it!

228
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,991
My girl too is the same.

229
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,443
Here sweetheart, I have brought
veggies enough to last us a week.

230
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:29,010
Onions and Potatoes.

231
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,946
You are here, big-brother.

232
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,787
Big-Brother
He is 20 years younger to you.

233
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,055
Auntie..l have told him so many times.
He just doesn't understand.

234
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,623
So what..Should I stop respecting
the young ones?

235
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,326
First gain some respect for yourself.

236
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,594
You don't work.
You sit idle at home all day long.

237
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,001
Who works, anyway?

238
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:49,929
Politicians sit idle on their chairs.

239
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,540
Officers sit idle in their offices.

240
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,099
They sit all day long
and then come back home.

241
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,708
I cannot do it.

242
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,474
Brother, she means you should
get out of house sometimes.

243
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,713
I should leave my old
mother alone in the house?

244
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,308
What are you saying..

245
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:03,545
She is my mother.

246
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,588
She isn't my landlady, unlike for you.

247
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:09,420
Oh god.. you're such a
thick-skinned fellow..so shameless!!

248
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,993
I don't know how to deal with you.

249
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,887
I think we should concentrate
on the dinner now, don't you feel hungry?

250
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,828
Auntie, you prepare roti..
I will cook veggies..

251
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,730
Today we will eat tasty
food with onions and potatoes.

252
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:17,960
Desi and Costly.

253
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,535
Not today, son.

254
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,829
Tonight we've to attend wedding of Sharma
ji's daughter. You too should join us.

255
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,734
<i>Okay</i>

256
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,666
We will have to give Rs. 500 as gift.

257
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,403
And he will do all the eating.

258
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,710
That's just the amount of mango drink
<i>I'll</i> have there.

259
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,774
Son, but that much will give you boils.

260
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,081
Then <i>I will</i> have 15-20
glasses of lime juice as well..

261
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:38,616
It will beat the heat...!!

262
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,657
Please eat in proportion, big brother..

263
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:42,951
...or they will send us the food bill.

264
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,359
Yes, as if you pay all the bills.

265
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,723
Useless fellow.

266
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,559
We will hide brother-in-law's
shoes behind the wine counter.

267
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:20,855
His friends will
go crazy finding them..

268
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,623
...but they won't be able to.

269
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,593
That's the perfect plan.

270
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:27,865
Come on, hurry up.

271
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:33,609
Their cook is pathetic.
All the veggies are so salty...!!

272
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,610
But I have heard they have
spent a lot of money on food.

273
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,738
No doubt.. they must have
spent a fortune just on the salt...!!

274
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:38,941
Sir..

275
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,517
Leave. And don't come back.

276
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:44,446
Come here, brother.

277
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,589
Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo!

278
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,727
It's been so long
since I last had chicken.

279
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:55,557
Go, and get a new
item after five minutes.

280
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,460
Sir, this isn't chicken.
It's cauliflower.

281
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,595
Damn you!

282
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,307
How will I recover Rs.
500 by eating cauliflower?

283
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,400
It will take me whole night. Get lost.

284
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,380
Hey hi.

285
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,430
Sir...

286
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:07,936
Yes. Feed me some hot chicken,
brother.

287
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,872
This isn't chicken.
It's soybean cutlets.

288
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,671
Actually there isn't
any non-vegetarian food.

289
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,003
The groom's family
has pledged against it.

290
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,576
Then why have you pledged
to make my life hell?

291
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,813
Can't they tell us all this
before we give Rs. 500 as gift?

292
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,782
You could at least
mention in the invite.

293
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,342
Get lost.

294
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,947
Rs. 11,000! Rs. 11,000! Rs. 11,000!

295
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,889
Rs. 11,000! Rs. 11,000! Rs. 11,000!

296
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,520
Girls, I have Rs.
5,100 with me. Take it.

297
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,690
No. we will take Rs. 11000.

298
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,496
Rs. 11,000! Rs. 11,000! Rs. 11,000!

299
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,726
Rs. 11,000!

300
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,430
You danced well.

301
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,400
The Bhangra you did later, good?

302
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,909
- Very good.
- Thanks.

303
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:51,778
11..
- Did you learn to dance or you are a born dancer?

304
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,641
Not a rupee less than Rs. 11000.

305
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,683
Rs. 11,000! Rs. 11,000! Rs. 11,000!

306
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,845
Rs. 11,000!

307
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,454
Rs. 11,000!

308
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,313
What a joke..

309
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,920
Don't you think it's way
too high than the market rate?

310
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,525
Hello? Who are you?

311
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,489
I am an agent. An insurance-agent.

312
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,566
Hello..

313
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:11,832
Brother..

314
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,730
It's okay.

315
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,599
I suggest you give Rs.
5100 to the girls.

316
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,301
And pay rest Rs.
5000 as the insurance premium.

317
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,845
I will tell you about a One
Time Investment plan. It's great.

318
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,848
No. Rs. 11000. His shoes
must be worth at least that much.

319
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,517
Which shoes?

320
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,414
The ones which the girl in blue has
wrapped in a paper and hidden back there?

321
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:33,019
I have seen them.

322
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,588
You get many such shoes
Near Amritsar Hall Bazaar for Rs. 2500.

323
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:38,657
No, you don't get them there anymore.

324
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,593
They aren't first copies.
They are fakes.

325
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,356
He is telling me about Amritsar!

326
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,360
You are from Amritsar?

327
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,766
I am sure you are
from BBK DAV college.

328
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,704
No, not all beautiful
girls are from BBK.

329
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,332
They could be from
Khalsa college as well.

330
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,334
I never said you are beautiful.

331
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,539
Actual beauty lies in the
Bhangra of Khalsa College.

332
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:58,512
Am I right, sister-in-law?

333
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,310
What a joke.

334
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,882
You know nothing about Amritsar.

335
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,611
Where in Amritsar do you stay?

336
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,814
Though I can knock any door I want.

337
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:07,814
<i>But this Ambarsariya
stays in everyone's heart.</i>

338
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,651
Brother-in-law, talk to your friend.

339
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,388
My friend? I don't even know him.

340
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,989
Brother, are you from the
bride's side or the groom's side?

341
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,029
I am from my Auntie's side

342
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,791
Which auntie?

343
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,700
Do you have an invite to come here..

344
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,636
I think he is a thief.

345
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:23,900
Blow up his brain.

346
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,509
Brother, it's a new turban.
I still haven't starched it.

347
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,942
Don't fire it unnecessarily.

348
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,775
You should be supporting me.
I am saving Rs. 11,000 for you.

349
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,871
I have come here for the wedding
of Sharma ji's daughter.

350
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:33,778
Right?

351
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,750
Son, you have come
to the wrong wedding.

352
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,048
This is the ceremony of
Gill Saab's daughter.

353
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,847
Sharma ji's ceremony is taking
place in the neighboring hall.

354
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:43,754
Actually what's the difference
between Gill & Sharma..

355
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,351
...when there's no chicken involved..
Right, auntie?

356
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,960
I suggest you should give Rs.
11,000 to the girls then.

357
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:47,860
It's a custom.

358
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,956
Give me 11 notes of Rs. 100.

359
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,332
Fine, then distribute
them on your own.

360
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,664
<i>I'll</i> see you when I am in Amritsar.

361
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,773
You ruined the ritual, you fool..

362
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,431
Don't ever come back to Amritsar!

363
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,442
Get lost from here.

364
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,070
Or I will hit your head with
sticks and make your brains mushy.

365
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,505
Stupid idiot...!!

366
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:05,946
She has lost it.

367
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,347
- Get lost.
- She has lost it.

368
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,678
Duffer..

369
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,921
I wonder where such people come from!

370
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,789
Tell me something, do you
have a brain defect since birth..

371
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,953
...or selling insurance
has made you go crazy?

372
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,022
What did you say?

373
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,065
Sane people don't behave like this.

374
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,727
First you made a beautiful
girl miss her bus.

375
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,633
If it were me, I would sell my
blood and take a cab on rent for her..

376
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,841
...and drop her to Amritsar.

377
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,475
The amount of blood
there is in your body..

378
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,106
...you won't even be able to
book a cab from Patiala till Sirhind.

379
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:42,910
- Hear him talk.
- You played your game with the insurance chick.

380
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:45,648
What about you pissing
in someone else's house?

381
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,780
This isn't right.

382
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,791
You cannot go to someone's wedding
uninvited and mess with the guests.

383
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,794
True. See my Boss didn't
even attend his own wedding.

384
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:55,854
This is the first time
I have seen someone so generous.

385
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,128
You've kept people
on pay-roll to insult you.

386
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,460
<i>L will slap you.</i>

387
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:02,304
- Good.
- Are you too just spinning a tale?

388
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,031
Get lost.

389
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:07,938
When I tie my turban and leave
the house the girls just dig me.

390
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,569
- And do you know what they say?
- What?

391
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,839
"I have fallen for you."

392
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,385
"Oh Ambarsariya!"

393
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,619
Hats off to you. You think
big of yourself. Self-Praises!!

394
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,427
I don't know true are your
stories..

395
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:25,984
But they are interesting for sure...

396
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,622
These girls seem out of your reach.

397
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:30,323
Tell me something about our business.

398
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,364
How do you manage
to sell so many policies?

399
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,333
What else have I done?

400
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,408
This is all I have done in my entire life.

401
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:11,932
Yes?

402
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,499
Good evening, sir.

403
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,501
I have come from the
insurance company, sir.

404
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,477
I have brought an
amazing policy for you.

405
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:18,980
You are selling policies at this hour?

406
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,607
Competition, sir.

407
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,709
There is stiff competition.
You won't believe it..

408
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,482
I have spared no one from
Jandiala till Fatehgarh-Churian.

409
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:26,487
Go away.

410
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:27,579
I don't want to buy any insurance.

411
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,523
Sir.. at least hear out my plan.

412
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,719
I'll clear out all your doubts.

413
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,888
- Really? Get in.
- May I?

414
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,660
- Come in.
- Thank you, sir.

415
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,557
Let me close this.

416
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,697
You look dashing today sir..

417
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,739
- Looking good sir.
- Thank you.

418
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,972
Very good environment, sir.

419
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,938
Lovely atmosphere.

420
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,705
Who is he? Who have you brought in?

421
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,804
He sells policies. He said he
will suggest good insurance policies.

422
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,574
Yes, sir.

423
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:52,842
What insurance do you deal with?

424
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,042
Life insurance, sir.

425
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:55,106
Life insurance.

426
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,447
God forbid if something
happens to you..

427
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,713
You never know with life, sir.

428
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:02,984
Just assume that you are dead,
then what about your family?

429
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,590
They will get the money, sir.

430
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:09,487
What say?

431
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,064
You are right, brother.

432
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,764
But the matter is,
who will dare to kill us?

433
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,062
You are so naive, sir.

434
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:17,897
What else have I done in life?

435
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,707
This is what I do.

436
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,552
Competition, sir.
Very tough competition.

437
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:21,696
Agent 221 reporting to Alpha Base.

438
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,605
Yes, sir.

439
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,069
Sir, the information was about
five goons but I got only four.

440
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,572
Yes, sir. Heavily armed.

441
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,911
They were well-prepared.

442
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:34,510
All four terminated.

443
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:35,749
Yeah.

444
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,316
I will report to you in the morning.

445
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,991
Would've been better
had you guys insured first.

446
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,507
- A lizard!
- Damn you! Where?

447
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,581
He has killed people?

448
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:18,950
Where was your gun when you barely
managed a beating in the wrong wedding?

449
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,328
Gun's battery was low.
He had kept it on charging. Right?

450
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,894
It was okay with the girls.

451
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:28,598
But you included a gun into the stow.

452
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:30,631
Now that's hard to digest.

453
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,798
- You guys don't believe me?
- No.

454
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,701
- You guys really don't believe me?
- No.

455
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,674
Okay then let me give you
a glimpse of my pistol...!!

456
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,876
Careful,
don't sprinkle the water on me.

457
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,084
Keep your toy gun inside,
we don't want to play Holi with you.

458
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,322
Keep talking.

459
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:49,722
- My naive friends,you don't believe me, do you?
- No.

460
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,486
Then let me tell you the
actual story..

461
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:55,793
"Like a tumbler made
of glass is a slippery thing"

462
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,561
"I might look naive but
I'm naughty inside."

463
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,997
"I might look naive but
I'm naughty inside."

464
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,307
"I might look naive but
I'm naughty inside."

465
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,320
He is so cute.

466
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:30,431
If he turns around and looks
at me then <i>I'll</i> give you a party.

467
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,426
You have kept such a small
desire hidden in your heart?

468
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:36,702
You should say it.

469
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,974
So you are getting a party.
Now say thank you.

470
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,535
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

471
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,850
Since last night all
channels have been encrypted..

472
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,517
No Auntie, put the eye-drops in his
eyes and you wear dark glasses yourself.

473
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,360
It's eye flu. It spreads..

474
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:00,794
<i>I'll</i> talk to you later, Auntie.

475
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:01,793
Good morning, sir.

476
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,628
Look here comes your Super Hero.

477
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,401
Do you watch a lot of movies?

478
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,298
Mrs. Sandhu, why you keep sending
this impulsive guy for missions?

479
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,667
Sir, it was a very tough mission.

480
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,568
And he's our best
Agent for such missions.

481
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,472
Okay, but next time, be careful.

482
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,874
- And you too.
- Yes, sir.

483
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,849
He is always angry.

484
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,281
- He is right.
- He complains it unnecessarily.

485
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:28,983
You shoot first then you ask..
no matter where you go.

486
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,586
It is difficult to explain it to him.
But you can understand.

487
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,629
After all, there are
only two Jatts in this agency.

488
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,663
You and me.

489
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,059
But this Jatti is your senior.
I say the final word.

490
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,824
Okay, Jatti ji.

491
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,672
Yes, sweetheart. I am still in office.

492
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,872
You know how a call center's job is.

493
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,501
One keeps getting phone calls nonstop.

494
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,038
Yes, I know.

495
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,377
Okay, I have cooked the food and
kept in the fridge.

496
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:55,481
Heat it up and eat it.

497
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,314
Okay, sweetheart. Yes.

498
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,354
Also tell mummy that...

499
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:02,948
...Pinchu's diapers are on the top
shelf in the storeroom.

500
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,686
Okay, sweetheart.
I am getting another call.

501
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:06,987
Okay, I have to go.

502
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,990
Bye, sweetheart. Love you too.

503
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,464
It's been two years, you are
still pretending to work in a call center?

504
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:17,872
He is either very naive
or he has lost it, madam.

505
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,742
- Shut up. Be serious at least sometimes.
- Okay.

506
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,411
Okay, come with me. I need
to give an important information.

507
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:26,844
Is it more important
that Pinchu's diapers?

508
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,755
Everybody knows how drugs
have been ruining most of the Punjab.

509
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:41,286
But since past six months, all
drug businesses have come to a stop.

510
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:45,466
Reason? Punjab's Home
Minister Inderjeet Bajwa.

511
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,999
From the time he has
become the Home Minister..

512
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,672
...he has put such stop
on the drug business..

513
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,647
...that all the drug dealers
of the state want him dead.

514
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:03,385
We have the information that
they have planned to kill him.

515
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:04,982
Let me show you.

516
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:08,746
Amritsar..

517
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,262
Our sources have told us..

518
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:21,800
There is going to be a huge function
here on Baisakhi day of 13th April.

519
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,499
And the Home Minister
is going to be the Chief Guest.

520
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,602
We think that he will
be attacked on this very day.

521
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,780
According to our information
the attacker's name is Manpreet..

522
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,406
...and that person
is hiding in this area.

523
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:39,011
But we have no other
information about this Manpreet.

524
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,793
We just know the name.
We don't know who that person is.

525
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:50,021
We don't even know whether
that person is a male or a female.

526
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:55,595
All we know is that Manpreet
is a huge threat to Punjab's peace.

527
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,841
And you need to find him and
eliminate him at any cost.

528
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,408
Madam, this is our Punjab.

529
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,577
And our Punjab's peace
isn't a child's sweet..

530
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:05,614
...which anyone can
snatch away that easily.

531
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,677
I won't let you down.

532
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,785
What else have I done in life?

533
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,514
This is what I have always done!

534
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:12,586
I trust you.

535
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,845
But we don't have much time on hand.

536
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,023
We only have seven days.

537
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,922
And your mission starts now.

538
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,520
Ma'am what will be my job this time?

539
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,393
Same, insurance agent.

540
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:25,395
My duty is to kill people yet
you give me job to sell life insurances.

541
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,694
I request you, please change it.

542
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:29,063
Am I not working in a call
center since the past two years?

543
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,897
You will know when you
have to wear a tie in this heat..

544
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,999
...ride a bike and sell
policies all day long.

545
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,571
And you will know when
you have to prepare the meal..

546
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,773
...give medicines to your mother-in-law
and arrange for Pinchu's diapers.

547
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,883
It's okay. I am sure your sweetheart
changes Pinchu's diapers sometimes.

548
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,378
Okay, ma'am. Don't worry.

549
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,387
From Fazilka to Mukerian,
I have not spared anyone.

550
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:52,687
And then, Amritsar is my birthplace.

551
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,916
Well done, guys. As you all know..

552
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,359
Once again our Amritsar':
branch has topped in Punjab.

553
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,567
And with this we are
starting a new scheme.

554
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,335
The employ who sells
maximum policies..

555
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:43,664
...will get the Employee
of the Month's title.

556
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,469
And believe me,
it's not an easy thing to get.

557
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,770
It's a difficult task.

558
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,670
And a very important thing..

559
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,646
Who is this?

560
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:09,863
Hello?

561
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,333
Who is it?

562
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,005
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

563
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:23,038
What are you doing here?

564
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,713
Now how can one lie into the face?

565
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,381
I was sleeping.

566
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,317
I had told you not
to show me your face again.

567
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,486
That's why I was sitting at the back.

568
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:34,950
I slept and started
snoring otherwise..

569
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,458
...I wouldn't have let you
know when I came and when I left.

570
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,956
Stop your nonsense.

571
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,789
I've heard enough of
your nonsense in Patiala.

572
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,896
This is "my" place.

573
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,795
As if your name is written all over
this place.

574
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:50,833
What a joke.

575
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,075
This is my office. Get out.

576
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,971
Stop blabbering.
I got transferred to this place.

577
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,410
Look at this. Head office
transferred me to Amritsar.

578
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,447
Specially.

579
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,285
They didn't transfer you. They
have transferred their trouble onto me.

580
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,821
Madam, you don't know
what God has sent to you.

581
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,790
If you get something without asking
for it then this is how you behave.

582
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,850
I will sell a lot of policies and
you will run after me with this shield.

583
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,552
And then I will not accept it.

584
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:16,863
Are you even true to your word?

585
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,359
How naive.

586
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,665
Ma'am, what else have I done in life?

587
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,331
This is all I have always done.

588
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,867
Damru... hey Damru

589
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,344
<i>l'll</i> slap you if
you address me as Damru.

590
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:36,542
Don't address him as Damru.
Damru gets angry.

591
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,345
I have told them, Damru.

592
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,046
I have told them. Okay?

593
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,785
Is this how you talk
to your father as well?

594
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,087
Don't take this to my father.

595
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,588
Then should I take it to your mother?

596
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,789
Wait here..l will teach
you a lesson today...!!

597
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,996
Hey Tiger.. You don't get so angry.

598
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:54,927
Hear that.

599
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,633
He addresses me as tiger and
then says that I shouldn't get angry.

600
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:02,436
How will anyone fear him
if a tiger doesn't get angry?

601
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,678
True.

602
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,348
But I mean, why are you fighting and
disturbing the peace of our country?

603
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,544
Our country's peace
isn't a child's sweet..

604
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:13,587
...which anyone can snatch
away that easily.

605
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,946
Really?

606
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,518
You have already mastered the
things which I learnt over the years..

607
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,356
What?

608
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,294
Listen..

609
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:21,722
Do you stay close-by?

610
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:24,059
Tell me where this place is.

611
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,062
I know where this place is.

612
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,938
But first go and beat them up,
then <i>I will</i> tell you.

613
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,804
Otherwise, I won't tell you.

614
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:33,907
Go.

615
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,442
- Really?
- Yes.

616
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,676
Go and teach them a lesson.

617
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,014
Go.

618
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:44,452
Kids, why are you troubling that kid?

619
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,417
Why? Is he your brother-in-law?

620
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,048
Look how these little popcorns pop!

621
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,316
Run away from here.

622
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,023
No, brother.
I came back from school tired.

623
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,628
I don't have the strength to run.

624
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,394
Can we go slowly?

625
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,868
Slowly-slowly?

626
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,798
The kids of this area are smart.

627
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,273
Run away.
While I am still being polite.

628
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,738
Then try being nasty with us.

629
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,776
Let's go, Bunty.
He is wasting our time.

630
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:12,811
Let's go.

631
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,042
Run away! Okay?

632
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,354
Look, I made them run away.

633
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:24,387
You made me do it,
otherwise I don't scold kids.

634
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,458
You can say that
to console your heart.

635
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,556
I know how you must
have gotten insulted.

636
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,564
Let's go.
Let me take you to your address.

637
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:34,827
Let's go.

638
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,011
So, you came back from school?

639
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,479
Don't act stupid, brother.

640
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:56,847
What's your name?

641
00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:59,419
Although my name in
school is something else..

642
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:02,362
...but everyone addresses
me as Jaanu.

643
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,657
Jaanu? Who gave you
such a sleazy name?

644
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:10,797
You should respect someone
who helps you when in need.

645
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,964
This name has a lot of benefits.

646
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:17,037
Whenever my English teacher
says Jaanu and beats me up..

647
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:21,276
...I swear even her
slaps give me pleasure.

648
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,519
Now forget about me
and tell me about yourself.

649
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,452
Why are you asking for this address?

650
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,751
I want a room on rent.

651
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,619
I had heard that there
is a room vacant in this area.

652
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,057
It's my house.

653
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,692
You'll face a lot of problem.

654
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,328
- Go back.
- Really?

655
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,731
Is this the house
- Yes.

656
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,334
- Who else lives here?
- This house is nothing less than a zoo.

657
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,530
Here we are.

658
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,647
Let's go.

659
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:57,648
Where to, bro?
Don't you have any manners?

660
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,651
The landlord is standing outside
and you are eager to go inside?

661
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,483
Okay, go inside.
I will remove my things meanwhile.

662
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,334
Why are you ringing the bell?
Couldn't you just come inside?

663
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,596
I am not alone.
There is a stranger with me.

664
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:16,729
- Who is it?
- A tenant.

665
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:19,940
Hey! Hello!

666
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,340
She is the owner of the house.
Say good afternoon.

667
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,441
- Good afternoon.
- You have come here as well?

668
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,876
What do you mean by here as well?

669
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,847
I have been addressing
you as brother...!

670
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:34,514
And you have been trying
to act fresh with my sister!

671
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,421
<i>Madam, please talk to Jaanu.</i>

672
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,686
Tell him the truth.

673
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,792
Jaanu, give this to me. You go inside.

674
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,822
Hey, don't get too frank with her.

675
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:45,025
Why have you come here?

676
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,561
I heard you're selling
Ice Cream at discounted rate here.

677
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,828
So I thought of trying it out.

678
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:52,963
What a joke.

679
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,502
I have come to take a room on rent.

680
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,508
You won't get it. Go away from here.

681
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,374
Don't be so atrocious.
Don't give such a harsh reply.

682
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:01,882
I am having trouble finding
a room and my job has already begun.

683
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,843
Now one needs a roof
over his head, right?

684
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,683
No. Don't you say that
you live in people's hearts?

685
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,380
So why do you need a room?

686
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,025
Now my age is such that
I cannot stay alone in the heart.

687
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:14,259
Can you?

688
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,922
- What?
- Be alone?

689
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:17,492
I am better off alone.

690
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:18,896
Don't mind it,
but because of your nature..

691
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,902
...you might have to spend
the rest of your life alone.

692
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,268
I suggest you change
your nature on time..

693
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,635
...otherwise you won't get marriage
proposals after you grow a moustache.

694
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:30,904
Tell me the rent of the room.
I am fine with everything.

695
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,949
We will discuss that later.
You first need to clear the interview.

696
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,381
Consider it cleared.

697
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:39,716
I not only know how to dwell in
hearts, I also know how to read them.

698
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,047
Did you talk to him about the rent?

699
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,323
Yes. Rs. 3,500 per month.

700
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:46,859
Did anyone ask you?

701
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,955
Son..

702
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:53,829
There are some rules if
you want to stay in this house.

703
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:58,435
The first rule is that you
will only speak when spoken to.

704
00:39:58,495 --> 00:39:59,496
<i>Okay</i>

705
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:01,636
The second rule..

706
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,013
A young girl stays here.

707
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,709
You won't roam around in
this house with your head uncovered.

708
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:09,577
And the third rule..

709
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,346
My daughter leaves
for college at 08:30am.

710
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,487
Tell me, will you be going
for you job before or after 08:30am?

711
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,717
I will leave after.

712
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:21,695
No, you should leave before 08:30am.

713
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,930
You shouldn't follow her.

714
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,761
Otherwise,
you know what people will think?

715
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,929
That we've have allowed a boy to follow
her just because he pays Rs. 3,500.

716
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:31,996
True, people will start talking.

717
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:36,674
Chotu, get four cups
of tea and a glass of water.

718
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,108
No thank you, auntie.

719
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:39,369
I actually don't drink tea.

720
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,677
Son, we have asked
him to get water for you.

721
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,574
He is so naive.

722
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,517
Son, we are not making
to treat you as a tenant.

723
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,887
We are going to treat
you as a member of this family.

724
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,492
We still get phone calls
from the previous paying guest.

725
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:56,821
Give him his pajamas
back and he will stop calling.

726
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:57,957
Keep quiet.

727
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,624
He had gifted it to me.

728
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,467
Another thing.

729
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:02,628
There's more?

730
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:08,369
Don't get fish,
meat, alcohol in your room upstairs.

731
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,979
If you feel like having
them then bring downstairs.

732
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,809
We will eat together.

733
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,542
- After all you are making me a family member.
- Yes.

734
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,017
He is smart.

735
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,977
Auntie, he still hasn't brought water.

736
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:20,077
Has he brought tea?

737
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,687
Oh yes, a family member!

738
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,086
I thought you'd run away..

739
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,421
But you finally took the room.

740
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,331
I didn't just take the room,
I opened a can of troubles I guess.

741
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:42,602
Hello? Where are you?

742
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,009
- Coming.
- But where are you?

743
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:47,048
<i>Here</i> I <i>am, madam.
Hi.</i>

744
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:47,980
I was tying my turban.

745
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,915
I have no one here to help me tie it.

746
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:52,385
Doing it by tying to
the doorknob is not the same.

747
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:55,718
But why do you
have such posters on the wall?

748
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,825
"The brother-in-law
should be milky white."

749
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,792
They don't belong to me.
They belong to Ram Khilawan.

750
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,430
You are sharing a room
with a person from UP?

751
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,363
No, madam.
He was their previous tenant.

752
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,059
The landlord doesn't
allow me to remove them..

753
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,563
...he says that the
wall behind it is ruined.

754
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,001
Sol have kept them as it is.

755
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,406
He seems to be a strange landlord.

756
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:13,769
Don't make me start, madam.

757
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,972
Your RAW agent is grating radishes
for parathas in the morning.

758
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,945
And frying ladyfingers
in the evenings.

759
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,908
And this evening the entire
family has requested taro in curry.

760
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,681
Apply mustard oil in
your hands while cutting them.

761
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,758
- It won't prick you.
- Okay, <i>I'll</i> apply the oil.

762
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,950
You too have got
a chance to joke today.

763
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,489
Okay, jokes apart,
I have sent a mail to you.

764
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,428
In contains our three suspects.

765
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,489
All three of them
go by the name Manpreet.

766
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,529
We have the information.

767
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:44,662
And all three of them
stay in this locality.

768
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,709
It's your job to checkout each of them.

769
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:54,008
And find out who is the one
who will shoot at the minister.

770
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:59,685
No, don't breathe.

771
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,684
You already have limited breaths.

772
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,883
You might run out of them right here.
There is nothing in there.

773
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,954
So he is suspect number one.

774
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,727
Dr. Manpreet.

775
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,559
Drums are playing.

776
00:43:09,786 --> 00:43:11,663
It's just an empty pipe
from the neck to the stomach.

777
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,028
But there has to be
a medicine for it, doctor.

778
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,769
There are many medicines, ma'am.

779
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,568
But it takes around 15
days for the medicines to work.

780
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,400
He won't even last 15 hours I guess.

781
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,966
Don't mind it.

782
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:23,476
Please treat him.

783
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:24,603
He has just one desire.

784
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,046
He wishes to see his
child before he dies.

785
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:28,572
<i>Oh my-</i>

786
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,984
You said that you want
medicines for his knees.

787
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:37,684
So what is this treatment
that you are seeking from me?

788
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,393
We needs medicines for his knees, son.

789
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,791
If his knees don't work how will..

790
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:44,093
...he manage to go to
Bathinda to see his son?

791
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:46,994
Okay. I misunderstood.

792
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:49,735
Why do you want to take
him on foot to Bathinda?

793
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,100
Take him on a bus.
Here are his medicines.

794
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:54,035
Leave. There are other
patients waiting to see me.

795
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:54,939
Get up, sir.

796
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:57,774
Find a rickshaw. It's hard
to find rickshaws these days.

797
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,745
Take him along, ma'am.

798
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,006
Come on, who is the next patient?

799
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,713
He seems newly married.

800
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,048
Hello.

801
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:07,981
Tea?

802
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,046
No, I have already had tea.

803
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,451
No, I am asking for one.

804
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,584
I have attended 10
patients since morning.

805
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:12,991
No one offered me tea.

806
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,620
Your pulse seems fine.

807
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,891
No, doctor.
Actually I am not a patient. Okay.

808
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,025
I am an insurance agent.

809
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,361
Damn you.
Didn't you read the board outside?

810
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,300
Salesmen not Allowed.

811
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:25,939
That's placed in the neighboring shop.

812
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:26,973
But you read it, didn't you?

813
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,839
Rules are same for everyone.

814
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,604
No insurance. Leave.

815
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:31,702
Listen to me.

816
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:33,975
Think with a calm mind,
if anything happens to you tomorrow..

817
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,318
...then your children will
end up with some money.

818
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:41,322
Companies make Insurance agents
learn these dialogues by heart.

819
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:42,686
They will have no effect on me.

820
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,692
I don't want to get insured.
Ask me why?

821
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,994
- Why?
- Because I don't have a child.

822
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,029
You give potency medicine
to other people..

823
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,102
...whereas you don't
have any child of your own.

824
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:57,599
You too should take
some pill sometimes.

825
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:59,663
If just eating the pills would
give you children..

826
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:02,777
...then you would sow the pill and
children would grow in pots overnight.

827
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,744
Then you could pluck
children from them.

828
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:08,280
Actually, you need to
be married to have a child.

829
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:09,713
And I am not married.

830
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:12,014
Actually look,
let me tell you everything in detail.

831
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:14,050
Hello! Hold on, son.

832
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:15,286
Here, take this.

833
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:16,415
Eat this.

834
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:17,757
What is this for?

835
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,725
This is for your shamelessness.

836
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:24,798
You shamelessly enter inside anyone
shop and force them to buy insurance.

837
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:27,026
I don't want to buy any insurance.
Get out of here.

838
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,599
There are many other things
a person can do. Let him work.

839
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,968
He is after my life.

840
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,808
I think this doctor is insane.

841
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,780
Doctor, you should
at least hear me out.

842
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,502
You got scared?

843
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:42,672
Are you insured?

844
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,374
Then why are you scared?

845
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:54,386
This bee was troubling me a lot.

846
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:57,657
It came inside without permission,
just like you.

847
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,860
That wheelchair?

848
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,397
Oh..

849
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,356
Actually, I treated a patient's knees.

850
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,868
He didn't have money to pay me.

851
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,403
He gave me his wheelchair
and I started using it.

852
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:21,740
Son, those who can hunt flying
bees don't need insurance policies.

853
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,281
I killed this bee with a dagger.

854
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:29,583
I can also kill a
mosquito with a bullet.

855
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:33,458
Get going-

856
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,469
Properly.

857
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,281
You cannot sway your hands.

858
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,784
My name is Manpreet.

859
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,684
You cannot do Bhangra!

860
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,348
And change.

861
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:19,027
Bend your knees. Yes.
You have to bring Gold medal. Very good.

862
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:20,332
Hello.

863
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,664
Hello. Hello. Fine.
Keep your bag and join the rehearsal.

864
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:25,636
Hurry up. Keep your bag there.

865
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:26,901
Come and do Bhangra.

866
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,734
Boys don't carry books these
days and he is carrying a bag.

867
00:49:31,534 --> 00:49:32,911
I think he is a science student.

868
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,914
Luddi steps.

869
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,580
What brings a studious boy here?

870
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:41,979
No, master. My insurance
documents are in that bag.

871
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,983
I work in an insurance company.

872
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,650
Jhumar steps!

873
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,559
Right. You should work.

874
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,492
You have a good face.
You are handsome.

875
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,296
Work hard during the
Bhangra rehearsals...

876
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,702
...and <i>I'll</i> get half of
your college fees remitted..

877
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:58,967
Only half, Sir?

878
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,932
The way you are dancing, not even
one-fourth of it will be pardoned.

879
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,912
Let me tell you, not even
one-fourth of it will be pardoned.

880
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,607
Smile, smile.

881
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:10,013
The smile shouldn't
disappear from the face.

882
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,344
Die but don't stop smiling. Don't stop

883
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:13,911
But for how long can a person smile?

884
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,012
A person can get tired as well.

885
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,989
"A person can get tired as well."

886
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,720
Bhangra is as vast as the sky.

887
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:21,657
There is Jugni to take a breather.

888
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,430
Jugni steps!

889
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,969
Sir, there is a notice for you.

890
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:30,860
- Here.
- Now what?

891
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,637
"Oh my dear, My Jugni.."

892
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:35,937
Stop. Stop.

893
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,710
Take a breather. Drink tea, boys.

894
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,010
Come here. You are all dressed up..

895
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,745
Have you come here for a Bhangra
rehearsal or to get yourself betrothed?

896
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,115
Sit down.

897
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:53,561
I have a poor sight.
Please read it for me.

898
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,759
It is a threat letter, Sir.

899
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:03,035
It mentions that if this time your Bhangra
team doesn't qualify during the festival..

900
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:09,299
Then it says you
won't be paid your full salary.

901
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:14,507
Why am I facing this trouble?

902
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,978
What's my fault in this?

903
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:20,885
Half the boys are on drugs and the
other half are crazy over female dancers.

904
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,023
Let me tell you about these dancer girls.

905
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,752
The Punjabi teacher asked one Gidha girl..

906
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:27,727
...you are here to dance, so
tell me what do you know about Mahiya?

907
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:31,458
She said, only I know about Mahiye.
Others are just suspicious about him.

908
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,632
- I don't want water.
- It's tea, sir. Tea.

909
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,434
It's tea.
I have a poor sight.

910
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,708
Give him two glasses.

911
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,882
Two. You won't be having any at home.

912
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:49,883
After all, you are a bachelor. Single.

913
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,616
How do you know that I am single?

914
00:51:56,379 --> 00:52:00,953
I have a poor sight,
but the second layer isn't right.

915
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,326
It is bad. How will it be right?

916
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,662
It can be right only if
someone else helps you fold.

917
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:10,329
How will you get good layers if you tie
the turban with the help of doorknobs?

918
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:14,975
I have a poor sight and
you ask too many questions.

919
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,971
If you cannot see then
go for medical insurance.

920
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,745
I am not like you.

921
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,406
You are wearing Raymond's shirt.

922
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,710
You are wearing a tie.

923
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,478
And an expensive watch.

924
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:27,712
And yet you ride the
milkman's bike, Yezdi.

925
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,021
How do you know that I ride Yezdi?

926
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:35,460
Have you seen a good breed of buffalo
move the tail after dunging?

927
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:39,825
Only Yezdi smears you with
grease and not the Bullet.

928
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:44,902
I have a poor sight but no
troublemaker can escape my sight.

929
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:50,377
I go after the troublemaker
like a bullet goes after the prey.

930
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:56,710
Notice, huh?

931
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:01,019
Here's the notice.

932
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,373
Your plan has worked, madam.

933
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,846
He still isn't here.

934
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,415
Ma'am has given him selective cases.

935
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,814
He won't find a place to escape.

936
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,615
He will now seek
a transfer on his own.

937
00:53:32,675 --> 00:53:34,655
It was a great scheme, ma'am.

938
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,949
Well, what else have I done in life?

939
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:39,987
This is all I have always done!

940
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,955
Watch out!
Watch out! Watch out! Let me warn you.

941
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,023
Stop messing around with me.

942
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:47,662
I will slap you so hard that
you'll see the stars in daytime..

943
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:51,803
Then you will say, oh my gosh,
why I'm seeing such fireworks...!!

944
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,635
Back off! I am warning you.

945
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,000
Hang Up now ..will you...!!

946
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:57,543
Idiot Lady...!!

947
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,079
I get a lot of phone calls.

948
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:04,374
What happened, madam?
You look very scared.

949
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,587
Forget that.
I have given you some work.

950
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,553
Did you do it?

951
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,356
You call this work, madam?

952
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,948
This is cruelty!

953
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,423
No one ever gives such
tough cases to anyone.

954
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,618
Tough?

955
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,062
This is how cases are over here.

956
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,695
This is what I thought as well, madam.

957
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,531
There has to be a reason behind it.

958
00:54:21,624 --> 00:54:23,399
You gave me standard cases.

959
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,665
It's not like you
have some enmity with me.

960
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,307
So the only solution I could
find that I should ask for a transfer.

961
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,502
I should pack my bags
and leave immediately.

962
00:54:33,736 --> 00:54:35,545
But then I heard my conscience speak.

963
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,408
"No, Ambarsariya."

964
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,012
"The high-heeled madam gave you
these cases with a lot of respect."

965
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,614
"So with the same respect
take God's name and go for it."

966
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:46,383
"And so, I entered the battlefield."

967
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:50,030
Here's the first of many policies.
A gift for you.

968
00:54:50,386 --> 00:54:52,093
Major. Tittarpal.

969
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,595
What? How did that happen?

970
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,033
He is a very shameless person.

971
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,970
Even Jasleen ma'am couldn't
sell a policy to him.

972
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:01,634
This is where we go wrong,
my bespectacled sister.

973
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,877
Don't tell the buyers what
are the benefits of buying a policy.

974
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,607
No. Wrong.

975
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,346
Scare them.

976
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,349
I make them very scared.

977
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,618
It's just one policy.

978
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,781
I had given you ten cases.
What about them?

979
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,324
Ma'am, you had given him ten cases..

980
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,417
...but he came back with
11 policies in a single day.

981
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:22,359
Ma'am, he is too good.

982
00:55:22,518 --> 00:55:24,327
My bespectacled sister,
you can calculate.

983
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:28,460
I have not spared anyone
from Jhabaal till Majeethia.

984
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,070
So guys, it's time to party now.

985
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:30,963
Yes! - Yes!

986
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,597
A party is due.

987
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,967
You can party on your own,
don't ask me, okay?

988
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:35,941
Why?

989
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,412
This is your success's party.
How is it possible without you?

990
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:40,673
Come with us.

991
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:42,305
Please.

992
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,483
And don't say please to me.

993
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,883
I don't like anyone begging me.

994
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:48,886
Especially the Ladies Staff.

995
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,658
There will be drinking in the party.

996
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,592
And I react strangely with alcohol.
Let me warn you.

997
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,758
Madam, I get a high if someone
gets drunk and just hugs me.

998
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,925
Don't ask me again.
I bind you with an oath.

999
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:02,565
Okay then it's final.

1000
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,603
I mean I"IO excuses.

1001
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:07,608
This party is for you so
you have to come. It's final.

1002
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,536
I knew you would make me attend it.

1003
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:11,703
How so?

1004
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:14,707
I can read hearts.

1005
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:18,876
So.. you're selling
alcohol without a permit.

1006
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,954
Breaking law in
SHO Haakam Singh's reign.

1007
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:26,927
You have no fear of Punjab police.

1008
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,952
This is how brave you are?

1009
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,827
You should arrest those who drink.

1010
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:33,461
I have pledged in Maharaj's
name not to drink.

1011
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,628
What is your Maharaj's name?

1012
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:37,593
Listen..

1013
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,739
Now you'll tell the Punjabi police
whom it should or shouldn't pickup?

1014
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,744
I didn't do anything, sir.

1015
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,041
I was sitting there quietly.

1016
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,042
Really?

1017
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:48,714
You too seem pretty brave.

1018
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:50,717
You are arguing with a police officer.

1019
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,912
Sir, you are troubling us.

1020
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:54,886
Whereas you aren't saying
anything to the main person.

1021
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:55,945
Who is the main person?

1022
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,685
He is sitting over there.
That fair guy.

1023
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,962
Sir, from his face it looks like
he doesn't fear Punjab police at all.

1024
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,634
We should investigate
as per the procedure.

1025
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,533
If we do a raid and catch your
main person on the first day itself..

1026
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,470
...then what will Punjab police do
for the next 29 days? Pluck mangoes?

1027
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,572
- Lakha..
- Yes, sir.

1028
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:17,643
Let's go. - Let's go.

1029
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,702
Let's go and meet their
main person. - Okay.

1030
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:24,917
So..

1031
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,419
Good evening, sir.

1032
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:30,552
He seems educated, sir. Let's not
get into nonsensical things with him.

1033
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,453
SHO Hakam Singh will talk to him.

1034
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,593
And that too in his own style.

1035
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,925
Do one thing,
throw others inside the jeep.

1036
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,992
Let them go, sir.
It's not their fault.

1037
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,505
We just got together coincidently
and started chitchatting.

1038
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,666
People gathered, and then
I started telling them my stow.

1039
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,535
As the atmosphere changed,
we brought our glasses out.

1040
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:51,772
"We brought our glasses out."

1041
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:53,836
Did you ask him whether
he has a permit to serve alcohol?

1042
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,940
Sir, this isn't business.

1043
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,942
We just go together
and started talking.

1044
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,648
He is such a sweet-talker. Don't ask.

1045
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:03,552
You should listen to his stow.

1046
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,957
I am sure you too
will want a drink. - Hey!

1047
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:08,488
Let it be, sir.
Don't get angry with him.

1048
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:11,923
He fears the Punjab police.
He is not at all brave.

1049
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,490
Really? - Yes.

1050
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,395
Fine then.

1051
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,401
Now you tell me,
what great epic do you know?

1052
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:20,440
Tell me the stow.

1053
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:22,840
Brother, now only you
can save us from the thrashing.

1054
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,875
I spend most of my
days sitting on a chair.

1055
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,612
Sir, if I begin from the beginning
then it'll become a very long story.

1056
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:32,478
Let's begin from something
which your department has interest in.

1057
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,383
- What?
- Alcohol.

1058
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,653
He seems educated.

1059
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:39,920
Yes sir... wisdom shows.

1060
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:43,890
So, the girl thought
that I cannot hold my alcohol.

1061
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,361
So she should get me drunk.

1062
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,730
She too seems educated.

1063
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,515
Wow!

1064
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:02,789
Wanna dance?

1065
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:05,759
You are so cute!

1066
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,462
Like this.

1067
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:13,866
Not bad.

1068
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:05,024
- Give me a water bottle.
- Here.

1069
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,625
No, not that one.
Please give me branded.

1070
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,458
This is the only one I have.
I don't keep any other.

1071
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:10,758
Here's your brand.

1072
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,800
No thanks. I will find it on my own.

1073
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,994
Have it. It's just water.
I will earn a good deed.

1074
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,003
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

1075
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:20,003
That won't change its quality.
Please Drink it.

1076
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:21,598
Thank you.

1077
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:25,841
For what?

1078
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:27,710
Keep it. It's for the water.

1079
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,477
People of Amritsar
are anyway generous.

1080
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:32,917
Moreover they don't like
taking money from girls.

1081
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:34,954
Thank God you don't
run a beauty parlor.

1082
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,387
You would go bankrupt.

1083
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:38,858
What a joke...

1084
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,788
I have been noticing
you since morning.

1085
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:41,920
You have been clicking photographs.

1086
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,327
...of every place that
you have been visiting.

1087
01:03:43,385 --> 01:03:45,763
That means you have been following me,
you stalker.

1088
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:49,093
I am giving you water
and you are abusing me.

1089
01:03:49,658 --> 01:03:53,105
Idiot, the one who follows
a girl is called a stalker in English.

1090
01:03:53,395 --> 01:03:55,898
I don't know what they
call them in Punjabi.

1091
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,972
In Punjabi, they just get beaten up..
before they are called by their name.!!

1092
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:01,643
One second.

1093
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:02,682
Give it to me.

1094
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:06,375
Hello? No,
no, I don't need a gym trainer.

1095
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:07,750
I need a yoga teacher.

1096
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,483
- Yoga teacher..
- Yes, Yoga.

1097
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,883
Okay. Thanks.

1098
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,985
You didn't tell me why
you clicked so many photographs.

1099
01:04:13,415 --> 01:04:16,021
Even a wedding photographer doesn't
click so many pics of the couple...!!

1100
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:18,022
Actually I have come from Canada.

1101
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,863
I am making a documentary on
Punjab and Punjab's culture. - Okay.

1102
01:04:21,957 --> 01:04:23,595
- Stay right there.
- Okay.

1103
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,670
Oh wow, beautiful turban.

1104
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,741
Will you include my
photographs in the documentary?

1105
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:32,870
Of course. I have never seen
a man with such an elegant turban.

1106
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,778
Then I would say you
haven't toured Punjab fully.

1107
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,474
Though my Amritsar': style
is beyond comparison..

1108
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,951
But if you go to Mansa city,
they keep their moustaches pointed..

1109
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,454
...and they wear the Maanshahi turban,
simply amazing, I tell you.

1110
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:42,680
And then those from Gurdaspur..

1111
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,486
They wear white long Kurtaa Chaadra
and tie their turbans with Shamle..

1112
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:46,652
They make everyone proud.

1113
01:04:46,982 --> 01:04:47,926
Those from Patiala tie Patialashahi

1114
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:50,359
Those from Sangrur wear the turban
which is little heavier on one side..

1115
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:51,523
It is incomparable.

1116
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:52,861
Then Jalandhar's special
style of turban.

1117
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,492
Then Samrala,
Ludhiana style of turban..

1118
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,764
Then we have layered turbans of
men from Chandigarh & Ropar..

1119
01:04:56,825 --> 01:04:58,702
Girls stop and gawk at them.

1120
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:01,500
Wait, did you forget
any other style of turban...?

1121
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,508
Let it be, madam.
No jokes when it comes to turbans.

1122
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,840
We've got our Sardaari after
a lot of Sacrifices.

1123
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,002
Oh my God.

1124
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:09,841
Why don't you compile an encyclopedia
on turbans.

1125
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,349
Well, just..

1126
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,714
Wait, wait, wait..

1127
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,047
Listen..

1128
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,522
Is that Gurdas Mann?

1129
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,525
What? Gurdas Mann?

1130
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:19,953
Yes.

1131
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,293
No, no, no. Listen to the song.

1132
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:22,953
Song?

1133
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:23,996
Song.. Listen..

1134
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,327
Where?

1135
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,886
Not this band.

1136
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:54,791
The sound of band, down.

1137
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,310
Forget the traffic.

1138
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,748
Traffic, down.

1139
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,785
All the other sounds, down.

1140
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:30,361
That's it.

1141
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:32,323
Down.

1142
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,405
Did you hear it now?

1143
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,055
It's all about concentration.

1144
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,798
Yes. - And remember..

1145
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:17,032
Along with concentration,
also keep your eyes open.

1146
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:20,537
You never know from
where you will be attacked next.

1147
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:21,842
So watch out dude...!!

1148
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:03,924
Minister <i>saab,</i> whatever you are doing to
stop the notorious drug network in Punjab..

1149
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,356
What do you think..

1150
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,624
...drug lords aren't going to sit idle..

1151
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:10,391
...for how long will you be
able to stop their such a big business?

1152
01:08:10,952 --> 01:08:15,025
I will stop them as long as I can.

1153
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:20,103
Youth used to be
the future of our Punjab.

1154
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:24,375
But nowadays they've succumbed
to this evil drug problem.

1155
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:31,852
70% of Punjab's population
is in the clutches of these drugs.

1156
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:35,382
But I feel proud of
those police officers..

1157
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:41,859
...who are fighting
against this menace along with me.

1158
01:08:42,517 --> 01:08:44,019
We will fight together.

1159
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:47,032
Sir, today's visit was a good one.

1160
01:08:47,422 --> 01:08:49,368
Please sir, have a seat.

1161
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:58,408
And sir, NGO has arranged
a program for Baisakhi.

1162
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,505
You're invited to be there
to motivate school children.

1163
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:04,607
It's a fancy dress program sir.

1164
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:08,083
Okay Mr. Sharma, you can
make me dress as Chacha Chaudhary.

1165
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:09,686
And you can become Sabu.

1166
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,554
What, sir!

1167
01:09:49,584 --> 01:09:52,656
The situation seem quite
serious as you had to come here.

1168
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:54,598
Yes, the whole agency is in action.

1169
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,360
The information of the
attack is absolutely confirmed.

1170
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:57,301
Hence, I had to come here.

1171
01:09:57,325 --> 01:09:58,861
We have to be very careful.

1172
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:01,601
Baisakhi function is going to take
place right here after three days.

1173
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,572
- What's your progress report?
- Have a seat.

1174
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:09,849
Manpreet Number One:

1175
01:10:09,971 --> 01:10:11,541
He is an Ayurvedic Doctor by profession.

1176
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,513
He seems stupid but his aim
is even better than Arjuna.

1177
01:10:14,576 --> 01:10:15,850
Very sharp guy.

1178
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,098
Manpreet Number Two:

1179
01:10:26,521 --> 01:10:28,364
He is a Bhangra Coach
in Khalsa college.

1180
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,599
He claims to have a poor eyesight,
but he can..

1181
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:34,336
...look at the grease stains
on the pants and know that..

1182
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,034
...the person drives
a Yezdi and not a Bullet.

1183
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,505
Clever like a fox.

1184
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,547
My Manpreet.

1185
01:10:53,348 --> 01:10:54,554
She's a bombshell...!!

1186
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:57,661
She is making a documentary.

1187
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,323
She keeps clicking photographs.

1188
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,001
She can also defend herself well.

1189
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:28,522
How can she kill someone..

1190
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,995
Yet anyone can die over her good looks...!!

1191
01:11:33,688 --> 01:11:38,831
I mean to say that all three of
them aren't what they seem to be.

1192
01:11:39,694 --> 01:11:42,800
It's a difficult job..
and we haven't got any clue to move on.

1193
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:45,611
By the way, we have got a clue.

1194
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:48,876
We are monitoring all incoming
and outgoing calls of this locality.

1195
01:11:49,437 --> 01:11:52,907
We have found out that the real
Manpreet has a birthmark behind the neck.

1196
01:11:52,974 --> 01:11:55,454
You may identify real
Manpreet with that mark.

1197
01:11:55,977 --> 01:11:58,617
Tell me about it, already we have limited
information, and now this weird situation..

1198
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,717
...how to look for this
birthmark behind their necks...?

1199
01:12:00,882 --> 01:12:02,919
I think I will have
to undress them to see it.

1200
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,531
You do whatever you want to..

1201
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,533
But please, hurry up.

1202
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,994
Ma'am don't say please to me.

1203
01:12:10,058 --> 01:12:12,664
I don't like anyone begging me.

1204
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,740
Especially the Ladies Staff.

1205
01:12:14,796 --> 01:12:17,072
My dear,
this Lady Staff is your boss.

1206
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:18,902
If you don't stop joking
then on the next mission..

1207
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:21,777
...<i>I'll</i> send you to such a place,
that you will start begging me.

1208
01:12:21,836 --> 01:12:22,940
Just a second.

1209
01:12:23,004 --> 01:12:23,812
Look this way.

1210
01:12:23,905 --> 01:12:24,713
Oh God!

1211
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:27,014
I don't believe what nonsense you do.

1212
01:12:27,075 --> 01:12:28,577
What's wrong with you?

1213
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,686
Stupid fool.

1214
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:35,819
But what to do?
He's our best agent.

1215
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:41,766
Oh my my my...

1216
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,803
She is so fair.

1217
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,597
It will be hard to find
even a pimple on her body.

1218
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,347
Such a beautiful girl
doesn't deserve a birthmark..

1219
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:10,795
Her hair is obstructing
the view of the neck..

1220
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:17,665
How's she?

1221
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:18,930
She's a bombshell...!!

1222
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,671
What's going on?

1223
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:29,778
Exercise...!!

1224
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:31,783
I can see that.

1225
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,012
Your eyes are working out, right?

1226
01:13:33,508 --> 01:13:35,078
You are very naughty, Keerat.

1227
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:37,556
You have no shame.

1228
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:39,853
You are teasing girls
in a decent locality.

1229
01:13:39,914 --> 01:13:41,689
I wanted to discuss
something with you.

1230
01:13:41,816 --> 01:13:44,558
Look, some teasing is going on for sure.

1231
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:46,093
But I am not the one doing it.

1232
01:13:46,821 --> 01:13:48,732
She is the one doing it.

1233
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,836
Hello!!

1234
01:13:52,894 --> 01:13:56,307
Her mobile is more expensive
than your motorcycle.

1235
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:58,674
And she gives me missed calls
from that very mobile phone.

1236
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:02,340
- Hi!
- Look, she is saying hi.

1237
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,674
Hi. She must have said it to me.

1238
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:04,807
After all, she is my neighbor.

1239
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,011
No.. Him.

1240
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:10,380
Your turban's looking nice.

1241
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,717
I told you, she is after me.

1242
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,793
So you also get up
early in the morning?

1243
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:17,523
Yes, since childhood.

1244
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:21,859
I get up early and start doing yoga.

1245
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,602
Yoga?

1246
01:14:23,658 --> 01:14:26,400
I have been looking for a yoga
trainer from quite some time now.

1247
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:27,865
But I can't find any.

1248
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:29,931
Hey.. he is right in front of you.

1249
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,539
Hey hello! From when
do you know yoga?

1250
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:35,444
A talent cannot stay
hidden for long, Keerat.

1251
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,413
What else have I done all my life?

1252
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:38,644
This is what I have always done!

1253
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,948
My Manpreet, tell me,
when should we keep the session?

1254
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:43,488
During the day or at night?

1255
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:45,491
Nothing in the night, okay?

1256
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:46,650
Whatever you want to do,
do it during the day.

1257
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,455
You are very naughty, aren't you?

1258
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:51,726
What will be your fees?

1259
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:53,732
How can I charge a neighbor?

1260
01:14:54,589 --> 01:14:56,626
It's a job of "good deed"..
to teach yoga.

1261
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,500
Then give me the address of "good deed"

1262
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:00,835
<i>I will</i> learn it from him.

1263
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:04,709
You might first have
to teach her Punjabi.

1264
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:06,801
She has come from abroad..
she is naive

1265
01:15:06,968 --> 01:15:09,608
at least she doesn't manipulate
people like you local girls do.

1266
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,911
Manpreet, jump across the
terrace and come tomorrow at 06:00am.

1267
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:16,653
We will make yoga poses
and make your neighbors jealous.

1268
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:18,449
What a joke.

1269
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,389
Oh, thank you so much.

1270
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:21,483
See you tomorrow, okay?

1271
01:15:21,516 --> 01:15:22,494
Okay, bye-

1272
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:23,494
Okay, see you.

1273
01:15:23,551 --> 01:15:25,861
We have done enough
"see you" from a distance.

1274
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,956
Now we will have a close encounter.

1275
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:30,600
Some good deed and some fun.

1276
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:33,896
If you want to do a good
deed then do it on a large scale.

1277
01:15:34,028 --> 01:15:35,905
I will invite everyone
in the locality in the morning.

1278
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:37,067
You can teach yoga to everyone.

1279
01:15:37,398 --> 01:15:37,899
Listen..

1280
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:39,000
Why are you ruining this for me?

1281
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:39,977
<i>L will.</i>

1282
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:41,537
I say, you should let it go.

1283
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,045
You won't let it go?

1284
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,043
Then invite them.
It makes no difference to me.

1285
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:51,355
But don't invite two
people from our locality..

1286
01:15:51,946 --> 01:15:52,924
Who?

1287
01:15:53,748 --> 01:15:57,457
I will tell you, but if you invite them
then you & me won't be friends anymore.

1288
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,327
At least tell me. I won't invite them.

1289
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:03,826
That ayurvedic doctor
and that Bhangra coach.

1290
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:05,795
I don't get along with them.

1291
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:06,998
<i>Okay</i>

1292
01:16:07,328 --> 01:16:10,798
Now I might not invite anyone else,
but I will surely invite them.

1293
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:15,279
Our Local girls are
also very naive actually.

1294
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,373
Tell me something.

1295
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,377
What does she see that I don't see in you?

1296
01:16:20,408 --> 01:16:21,853
She is going crazy about you.

1297
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:23,756
All the time your eyes
are laden with kohl..

1298
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,483
How the hell will you see
this Ambarsariya Jatt's beauty?

1299
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:26,855
Go and wash your eyes.

1300
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,019
Then you will start singing.

1301
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,057
What?

1302
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:35,729
"Oh I have fallen for you,
Oh handsome Ambarsariya"

1303
01:19:19,053 --> 01:19:21,932
Good morning, Yoga Sir.

1304
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:26,629
Good morning. Good morning.

1305
01:19:29,063 --> 01:19:30,736
So you didn't listen to me.

1306
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:33,471
You invited them anyhow.

1307
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:35,605
The need yoga the most,
I couldn't help it.

1308
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:38,883
Don't worry, bro. I am in your team.

1309
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,784
You can carry on with
your foreigner bombshell

1310
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,823
I will handle the rest.

1311
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:47,423
You seem to be acting
like a messiah towards me.

1312
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,695
If you end up with that bombshell..

1313
01:19:49,784 --> 01:19:51,593
...then you obviously
won't be eyeing my sister..

1314
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:53,961
You are a scoundrel.

1315
01:19:53,988 --> 01:19:55,661
Not as much as you are...

1316
01:19:55,823 --> 01:19:57,063
Come on, start doing yoga.

1317
01:19:57,358 --> 01:19:58,393
How long will you take to begin?

1318
01:19:58,459 --> 01:20:00,370
Hold on. What's the hurry?

1319
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:03,341
Let the foreigner come.
Then we all will do it together.

1320
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:06,409
Together?
What are we working on the field??

1321
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:07,445
We are here to do yoga.

1322
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:08,804
Fine..

1323
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:10,939
But I have a poor sight.

1324
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:12,608
But my sights are still set on her.

1325
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,448
I have been waiting
for her since morning.

1326
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:17,311
Have you ever waited
for you sister as much as..

1327
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,948
...you are waiting for that foreigner?

1328
01:20:22,683 --> 01:20:24,390
Good morning, everybody.

1329
01:20:24,485 --> 01:20:25,862
Hello, Guru-ji.

1330
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,432
- Hello. Good morning.
- Hello.

1331
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:30,492
Good morning.

1332
01:20:31,592 --> 01:20:32,662
Myself Manpreet.

1333
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,966
- Good morning.
- Give it here.

1334
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:35,403
Yes..

1335
01:20:35,496 --> 01:20:38,500
- Here, close to me.
- You let it be.

1336
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,010
Come here.

1337
01:20:40,968 --> 01:20:42,845
Adjustment is done.

1338
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:46,810
- Shoes.. We have the same size.
- White ones.

1339
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:49,718
- He deserves them.
- Same size.

1340
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:51,413
Are you guys done?

1341
01:20:51,612 --> 01:20:52,989
- Yes. Let's begin.
- Yes.

1342
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:55,889
Concentrate okay?

1343
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,997
First, close your eyes..

1344
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,459
Now we will take deep breaths.

1345
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:02,728
Deep breaths

1346
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:07,436
Brother, take this with you.
It will come in handy.

1347
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:09,664
Yoga..Perfect.

1348
01:21:11,799 --> 01:21:14,006
So, keep taking deep breaths.

1349
01:21:14,602 --> 01:21:16,377
Keep your eyes closed.

1350
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,083
Concentrate.

1351
01:21:19,907 --> 01:21:21,409
Keep your eyes closed.

1352
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:24,016
Breathe from the navel.

1353
01:21:25,379 --> 01:21:27,325
Keep your eyes closed.

1354
01:21:30,017 --> 01:21:31,963
So we should keep our eyes closed?

1355
01:21:32,086 --> 01:21:33,793
Also keep your mouth closed.

1356
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:35,027
And also your eyes.

1357
01:21:35,089 --> 01:21:36,762
Concentrate.

1358
01:21:37,391 --> 01:21:39,064
Take deep breaths.

1359
01:21:44,465 --> 01:21:47,378
Well, yoga doesn't help
as much as the local medicines.

1360
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,482
I have helped form many generations.

1361
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:51,945
Oh. So then why are you here?

1362
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,520
To tell you the truth,
I am here to see you.

1363
01:21:55,676 --> 01:21:58,953
Otherwise, I've so many patients
that I don't have time to spare.

1364
01:21:59,046 --> 01:22:01,424
My clinic runs well
because of well-wishers like you.

1365
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:03,393
I told you to take deep breaths.

1366
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:05,363
I didn't invite you here to boast...!!

1367
01:22:05,419 --> 01:22:06,955
Keep your eyes closed.

1368
01:22:08,489 --> 01:22:10,526
Don't open your eyes at all.

1369
01:22:12,793 --> 01:22:13,965
Can you do Giddha?

1370
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,363
Giddha?

1371
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,732
Giddha! Shame on the one
who doesn't learn this Giddha dance.

1372
01:22:17,798 --> 01:22:19,038
No. No Giddha.

1373
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:20,471
You should learn it.

1374
01:22:20,668 --> 01:22:22,614
It's a dance as well
as a form of exercise.

1375
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:24,980
We are anyway falling short
of one girl in our troupe.

1376
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:26,746
If you want, I can teach it to you.

1377
01:22:27,508 --> 01:22:30,955
You can dance later,
first concentrate on doing yoga.

1378
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:34,090
Keep your eyes closed.

1379
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:37,461
Can we smile?

1380
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:39,532
Die but don't smile.

1381
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:43,458
So the next one is..

1382
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:45,498
Our next <i>asana</i> is..

1383
01:22:45,693 --> 01:22:46,603
<i>The asana is..</i>

1384
01:22:46,627 --> 01:22:47,833
Are you sure you know yoga?

1385
01:22:47,962 --> 01:22:48,804
Why do you need the book?

1386
01:22:48,896 --> 01:22:52,070
He has published
a lot of books on yoga.

1387
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:53,806
He has written about so many asanas..

1388
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:56,007
...so he sometimes forgets about them.

1389
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:57,777
Yes. - Yes.

1390
01:22:57,905 --> 01:23:01,512
Yes, so the yoga's
book basically says that..

1391
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:04,489
...a person should do
the <i>asana</i> in an openly manner.

1392
01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:07,023
So do one thing, remove your
tops and keep them on the side.

1393
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:09,353
What are you saying, boy?

1394
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,722
You are asking us to strip?

1395
01:23:10,851 --> 01:23:12,853
I am not wearing any vest inside.

1396
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:14,867
Why are you insulting
me in front of madam?

1397
01:23:15,022 --> 01:23:16,467
My body will be visible to all.

1398
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,762
Oh no, Mr. Bhangra Coach.
Even if you were wearing a vest..

1399
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:20,534
Your vest contains so many holes..

1400
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:22,563
...that we would be able to
see your body anyhow...!!

1401
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:24,441
You understand Pinda?

1402
01:23:24,832 --> 01:23:26,004
Pind? Village, right?

1403
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:27,011
No, Pinda.

1404
01:23:27,034 --> 01:23:28,604
Okay. I will tell you later.

1405
01:23:28,769 --> 01:23:29,747
Rather, I will show you.

1406
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:33,582
Shut up.
I know why you are so jealous.

1407
01:23:33,674 --> 01:23:37,554
You think I will teach her
to do Giddha and "set" her for myself.

1408
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:39,614
You should be inspired instead..
You don't get jealous.

1409
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,919
You should try to compete
with talented people.

1410
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,659
Only if a person is talented.

1411
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:48,598
You steal from YouTube
and teach Bhangra to the kids.

1412
01:23:48,756 --> 01:23:51,532
Shame on you. - YouTube!
Is it your private property?

1413
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,064
What is this that
you have said, Doctor?

1414
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:55,568
You called him a thief?

1415
01:23:55,896 --> 01:23:57,273
He didn't call me a thief.

1416
01:23:57,431 --> 01:23:58,671
No, may be it was a slip of a tongue.

1417
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,041
- But it means the same, right?
- Yes.

1418
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:03,373
- Yes.
- Yes? Yes?

1419
01:24:04,438 --> 01:24:06,816
Okay, I said it if I said it.
Do whatever you want to.

1420
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:09,287
- I am not scared of you.
- Right, you aren't scared.

1421
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:10,913
I know you. I know what you are.

1422
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:13,516
You are a fake. You lie all the time.

1423
01:24:13,614 --> 01:24:17,027
You crush Anacin and Disprin tablets
and make your Ayurvedic Medicines.

1424
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,561
And then you tell people
that you are a doctor.

1425
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,031
You are a fraud.

1426
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:22,801
He abused him.

1427
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:25,393
- He shouldn't have abused him.
- Damn you.

1428
01:24:25,459 --> 01:24:27,996
Then why for four years did you
take medicines from me to grow taller?

1429
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:30,372
Shame on you for calling me a fraud.

1430
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:34,378
Tell everyone,
I was 6 feet tall young man.

1431
01:24:34,468 --> 01:24:37,347
After having your medicine,
I ended up being only 4 feet tall.

1432
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,011
Then you should have continued
eating them for another three years.

1433
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:43,050
Then you might have
disappeared altogether.

1434
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:45,882
Wait, <i>I will</i> make you
disappear with my dance!

1435
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,517
No! Now don't tear
each other clothes, please.

1436
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:50,754
No matter how many words you exchange,
don't tear each other clothes.

1437
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:52,559
And it's torn..

1438
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,798
Somebody stop them.

1439
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,960
Don't tear each other clothes.

1440
01:24:57,591 --> 01:25:02,267
My God! Guys! Stop it!

1441
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,407
Why are they fighting?

1442
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:11,415
Guys, please stop it. Oh my, God!

1443
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:20,619
You tore my clothes,
now you see what I do!

1444
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:22,995
What's wrong with you guys?

1445
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,024
What's wrong with them?

1446
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,062
You want to mess around anymore?

1447
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:31,497
Guys, stop it!

1448
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,805
Do something, stop them.

1449
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:47,446
Wait!

1450
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,085
No one will!

1451
01:25:58,986 --> 01:26:02,024
- Now tell me..
- Stop, stop, stop!

1452
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:06,804
The two of you are so violent.

1453
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:08,669
You fight like dogs.

1454
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:09,936
Shame on you both!

1455
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:11,407
- Sorry.
- Stupid.

1456
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:40,564
Ma'am that Doctor and
the Bhangra coach are not our suspects.

1457
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:41,639
They don't have the birthmark.

1458
01:26:41,662 --> 01:26:42,902
That leaves us with my Manpreet.

1459
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:45,374
Be careful. She seems very clever.

1460
01:26:45,566 --> 01:26:47,011
I am not fifth grade
student either, madam.

1461
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:48,439
I too am very sharp.

1462
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,545
I will handle her well
and you will praise me.

1463
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:54,977
There she is.. Miss foreign returned!!

1464
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:57,386
Okay, I will send you
detailed report in the evening.

1465
01:26:57,678 --> 01:26:58,713
Yes. Hello?

1466
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:00,416
I will also send our coffee bill.

1467
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:02,587
Coffee?

1468
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:29,277
Oh my God!

1469
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,550
Please keep clicking..

1470
01:27:33,447 --> 01:27:34,824
So cute!

1471
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,360
When did you come?

1472
01:27:36,383 --> 01:27:38,624
Just. When you pulled your
phone out to click a selfie.

1473
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:40,765
I thought let's turn
your selfie into a "family selfie"..

1474
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:42,959
Oh so cute, Mr. Charming.

1475
01:27:43,724 --> 01:27:45,897
Tell me what will you have?
What should I present you with?

1476
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,302
Black coffee?

1477
01:27:47,361 --> 01:27:47,862
Sugar?

1478
01:27:47,928 --> 01:27:49,339
Obviously without sugar.

1479
01:27:49,396 --> 01:27:51,933
No wonder you have kept yourself so fit.

1480
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,006
So cute!

1481
01:27:58,672 --> 01:28:00,709
Bro, give me two black
coffee "without sugar"

1482
01:28:00,774 --> 01:28:02,685
One with no sugar,
and one loaded with sugar.

1483
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:03,586
Yes, sir?

1484
01:28:04,678 --> 01:28:05,884
What a joke..

1485
01:28:06,046 --> 01:28:08,424
Give me coffee.
My Manpreet is waiting.

1486
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:09,450
Okay, sir.

1487
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:12,489
Whose phone is it?

1488
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,567
This Insurance Office Boss
of mine is after my life...!!

1489
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:19,366
Take up a job of cleaning the streets
but never take up an insurance job.

1490
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:25,510
She is a very shameless woman.
She won't stop.

1491
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:26,874
It will be her for sure.

1492
01:28:27,434 --> 01:28:28,606
Look.. It's her.

1493
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,573
Wait, I will show you.

1494
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:31,782
- Hello!
- What hello?

1495
01:28:31,805 --> 01:28:32,647
Hey where have you been?

1496
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:33,776
You didn't come to
office for two days.

1497
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:35,582
Madam, a person may
have other things to do.

1498
01:28:35,676 --> 01:28:37,087
I was busy. - What work did you have?

1499
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:39,523
I sell insurance policies.
It's not like I clean the streets.

1500
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,888
Okay. Bye. See you. I am busy.

1501
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:43,120
What do you mean you are busy?
That too during office hours?

1502
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,364
I have come in relation
to office work only...!!

1503
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:46,831
A very big client is over here.

1504
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:47,695
How big?

1505
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:48,859
Have you seen Godzilla in the movies?

1506
01:28:48,889 --> 01:28:49,959
That big a client.

1507
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:51,094
Madam, I will tell you once we meet.

1508
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:52,962
Why are you wasting my time? Okay bye.

1509
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,368
She is a very irritating woman.

1510
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:56,668
Actually she should've been the
one with that birthmark behind her neck..

1511
01:28:56,730 --> 01:28:58,300
I wouldn't have thought twice
before pulling the trigger on her...!!

1512
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:03,438
Yes?

1513
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:06,481
Yes?

1514
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:09,878
Yes, what are you doing
in this shopping mall all decked up?

1515
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:12,580
Which client are you entertaining?

1516
01:29:13,347 --> 01:29:16,590
There are my clients.
Big shops, big clients.

1517
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:17,890
You can enter any shop you want.

1518
01:29:18,018 --> 01:29:18,860
Oh really?

1519
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,559
As if they are ready for you..

1520
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:21,998
And will ask,
"Please Sir. Sell us an Insurance Policy"?

1521
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:25,333
Madam, from Bhikhiwind till Qadian,
I haven't spared anyone.

1522
01:29:25,559 --> 01:29:26,560
Don't take me lightly.

1523
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:28,607
Really? Then tell
me who is your client?

1524
01:29:29,763 --> 01:29:32,437
There.. there he must be..
Look over there...!!

1525
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,807
That? - Yes.

1526
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:40,449
Then let's go. Let me see
how you sell policies today.

1527
01:29:40,841 --> 01:29:42,445
I suggest that I go alone.

1528
01:29:42,743 --> 01:29:45,519
No, I want to watch you work today.

1529
01:29:45,746 --> 01:29:47,919
Let's go.
Let me see how you do business.

1530
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:51,021
Okay. Let's go then.

1531
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:54,524
Take this.
One with sugar and one without.

1532
01:29:55,789 --> 01:29:57,496
Just go for it. Come on.

1533
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:05,307
Stupid.. stood me up...!!

1534
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:09,871
Let's see if you can amaze us
with your products.

1535
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:10,779
...we are here with loaded pockets...!!

1536
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:13,682
Welcome Sir..
Please have a seat.

1537
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:16,615
Are we here to buy
jewelry or sell insurance?

1538
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:19,886
This is where we go wrong.
We go straight to selling policies.

1539
01:30:20,347 --> 01:30:22,884
May I know for whom
are you buying the jewelry?

1540
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,452
Of course you can.

1541
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:26,325
There is nothing to hide in that.

1542
01:30:28,422 --> 01:30:30,902
My wife, my better half.

1543
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:33,566
Oh hello, don't get too frank.

1544
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,605
I'll insult you in front of everyone.

1545
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:37,365
She is a typical Punjabi wife.

1546
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:40,571
If you get romantic in front of others,
she gets angry.

1547
01:30:40,634 --> 01:30:41,578
Mine is just the same.

1548
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:43,405
Tell me what "item" should I show you?

1549
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:45,706
What "item" can you show a married man?

1550
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:49,011
Show us a necklace
which matches her beauty.

1551
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:52,719
Tell us, how is madam's choice?

1552
01:30:53,547 --> 01:30:54,685
Ever so naive.

1553
01:30:55,449 --> 01:30:57,486
You can gauge it on your own.
Her choice is right in front of you.

1554
01:30:57,851 --> 01:31:01,458
Okay. Chotu,
then get a cheap necklace.

1555
01:31:01,755 --> 01:31:04,031
Okay.. joking, right? It's okay.

1556
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:07,029
Ma'am, is it a love
marriage or an arranged one?

1557
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:09,432
Love marriage with him?

1558
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,473
He doesn't even deserve my hatred.

1559
01:31:12,299 --> 01:31:13,801
Punjabi wife.

1560
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:16,447
She loves me a lot
but never expresses it.

1561
01:31:16,937 --> 01:31:17,972
Same to you, sweetheart.

1562
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,484
It will be a flop show for you today...!!

1563
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:21,813
Okay, fine. Look around.

1564
01:31:22,476 --> 01:31:24,456
Let her tour the shop. She is choosy.

1565
01:31:24,945 --> 01:31:26,686
Show me the necklace, will you...?

1566
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:29,886
Look at this one, brother.

1567
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:30,995
It's nothing special.

1568
01:31:31,518 --> 01:31:32,929
What are you doing? Show him this one.

1569
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,090
This one is very good.

1570
01:31:34,488 --> 01:31:36,991
Look at this,
handy work of artisans from Lucknow.

1571
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:39,869
Sir, show me something
that makes a person say..

1572
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,496
"Oh my God, it's so beautiful!"

1573
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:43,803
Oh my God, it's so beautiful!

1574
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:45,942
Look at that. She has already chosen...!!

1575
01:31:45,999 --> 01:31:47,842
- It is worth just Rs. 85 thousand.
- Yes.

1576
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:49,775
Chotu, get the bill.

1577
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:51,606
Rs. 85 thousand...??
Even my Yezdi isn't that expensive.

1578
01:31:51,705 --> 01:31:52,649
What?

1579
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:54,814
You got confused.

1580
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,522
She saw me in the mirror.
She is calling me beautiful.

1581
01:31:57,811 --> 01:31:58,482
<i>Okay</i>

1582
01:31:58,545 --> 01:32:00,422
She has lost her mind
after looking at the jewelry.

1583
01:32:04,918 --> 01:32:07,524
Oh on girl,
you have fallen for the jewelry?

1584
01:32:08,288 --> 01:32:10,700
If you would've seen at
yourself as you see the jewelry..

1585
01:32:11,024 --> 01:32:13,504
...you would know how
beautiful God has made you.

1586
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:16,736
In my beloved's eyes
that resemble the sunlight.

1587
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,037
...let me put the dark kohl
resembling a moonless night.

1588
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:21,539
Twinkle twinkle, all the little star..

1589
01:32:21,635 --> 01:32:23,376
...let me weave them into your veil.

1590
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:25,345
Ringa-ringa taking all
the roses in the world..

1591
01:32:25,405 --> 01:32:27,316
...let me paint them on your lips.

1592
01:32:27,674 --> 01:32:30,883
Two little dicky birds,
let me use them to adorn your beauty.

1593
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:34,815
Let me tell you,
don't take it as a joke.

1594
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:37,591
You are really very beautiful.

1595
01:32:41,755 --> 01:32:43,530
So then, why do we need this?

1596
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:50,475
Now keeping my thoughts
in mind show us a necklace.

1597
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:52,067
You shouldn't keep something
so expensive out in the open.

1598
01:32:52,332 --> 01:32:53,538
Keep it inside.

1599
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:57,341
Brother, God has made
your wife with His own hands.

1600
01:32:57,504 --> 01:33:00,007
Our workers cannot prepare a
jewelry that can match to her beauty.

1601
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:00,945
It happens sometimes.

1602
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:02,681
In our business as well
we sometimes get clients..

1603
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,450
...whose wishes we cannot fulfill.

1604
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:07,048
Business? What business do you do?

1605
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:08,649
Insurance Company.

1606
01:33:08,715 --> 01:33:11,286
Brother, don't mind..
Insurance agents are the worst.

1607
01:33:11,418 --> 01:33:13,557
Once they attach themselves
to someone like a leech..

1608
01:33:13,654 --> 01:33:14,826
...they are very
difficult to get rid of.

1609
01:33:14,888 --> 01:33:16,561
You should first check
who is standing in front of you.

1610
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:18,830
Brother, God is making
us do this good deed.

1611
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:22,331
She is the greatest wealth of my life.

1612
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:24,304
Sister, God forbid if something
happens to me tomorrow..

1613
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:26,969
...I will at least be
assured that my love is safe.

1614
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:30,004
You won't be taking your
money to your grave with you, brother.

1615
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:32,375
There is nothing greater
than love in this world.

1616
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:33,541
Do you understand?

1617
01:33:37,477 --> 01:33:40,754
Brother, what you said is so true.

1618
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:42,788
I never thought like that.

1619
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:43,760
Then think about it now.

1620
01:33:43,817 --> 01:33:45,057
Do one thing then.

1621
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:46,955
Send me an agent tomorrow itself.

1622
01:33:47,087 --> 01:33:48,862
I too want to get myself insured.

1623
01:33:50,357 --> 01:33:52,394
- You want to insure yourself?
- Yes.

1624
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:54,504
You have kept a lot of staff here.
Who sits on the cash counter.

1625
01:33:54,561 --> 01:33:55,505
We both personally.

1626
01:33:55,562 --> 01:33:57,337
This is how any business runs.

1627
01:33:57,431 --> 01:34:00,378
I never consider myself the
owner and my staff as my staff.

1628
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:02,547
I always carry at least one form with me.

1629
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:06,551
Brother, I want the
most expensive insurance.

1630
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:07,880
I don't have a pen.

1631
01:34:08,041 --> 01:34:10,851
- Let me fill it, Mr. Husband.
- Thank you.

1632
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:13,322
After all, a Punjabi wife.

1633
01:34:14,748 --> 01:34:17,058
Make it over Rs. 10 lakhs. Okay?

1634
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:22,795
- Can I say something?
- Yes, of course.

1635
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:26,604
That necklace did
really look good on you.

1636
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:30,604
<i>I'll</i> have to agree that
you have a great choice.

1637
01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:35,847
I indeed have a "great choice"

1638
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:40,741
Here you go.

1639
01:34:40,807 --> 01:34:43,754
The insurance girl has fallen for you.

1640
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:45,619
Shut up.
Sir is sitting over here.

1641
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:46,953
Who are you to interrupt?

1642
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:50,794
Let me advice you. No matter
how crazy the woman is over him..

1643
01:34:51,051 --> 01:34:52,997
But he shouldn't marry
that insurance girl.

1644
01:34:54,421 --> 01:34:55,491
Ask me why.

1645
01:34:57,524 --> 01:34:59,470
Speak up. Have you come
to your uncle's funeral?

1646
01:34:59,793 --> 01:35:01,864
What do we do, sir?
We are scared of the police.

1647
01:35:01,929 --> 01:35:03,306
Really? - Yes.

1648
01:35:03,563 --> 01:35:05,440
You need to reply to the department.

1649
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:07,672
...or else the department
extracts a reply out of you.

1650
01:35:08,268 --> 01:35:11,408
Now the fact is,
she is her senior officer.

1651
01:35:11,705 --> 01:35:13,480
A woman already holds a senior
position in the house itself.

1652
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:16,645
If he gets married to
her then he will be like..

1653
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:19,054
...someone who has been arrested
by the police without any fault.

1654
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:20,656
I too suggest the same.

1655
01:35:20,814 --> 01:35:22,555
You should let go
of the insurance girl.

1656
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:24,357
You should go for the landlady.

1657
01:35:24,751 --> 01:35:26,924
You will never have to pay rent again.

1658
01:35:27,387 --> 01:35:28,730
That's all you can think about?

1659
01:35:28,789 --> 01:35:30,632
You are born a cook
and you will die a cook.

1660
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:32,602
Ask him, whom does he like?

1661
01:35:32,759 --> 01:35:35,399
He has gone so far into his
memories that he still hasn't spoken.

1662
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:36,772
All of you are selling
your thoughts to him.

1663
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:39,743
No matter whom he lives,
once sir said that.

1664
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,837
...he should not marry the insurance
girl then he shouldn't marry her.

1665
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:43,609
We don't know what happens ahead.

1666
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:44,944
It is possible that
he got married to her only.

1667
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:45,779
Really?

1668
01:35:45,839 --> 01:35:47,580
Then let's place a bet on that.

1669
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:49,951
Hold on.
Here's my Rs. 100.

1670
01:35:50,610 --> 01:35:52,521
It will be the landlady.

1671
01:35:52,879 --> 01:35:55,621
Place Rs. 100 on the landlady,
on my behalf as well.

1672
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:57,758
Here's his Rs. 100.

1673
01:35:58,318 --> 01:36:00,320
None of them.

1674
01:36:00,854 --> 01:36:02,424
I too bet Rs. 100.

1675
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:04,666
You are gambling openly?

1676
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:08,502
Sir, we are just doing it for fun.
Within family. - Yes.

1677
01:36:08,528 --> 01:36:10,303
- Just for fun?
- Yes.

1678
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:11,943
<i>- Lakha.
- Sh.</i>

1679
01:36:12,866 --> 01:36:14,709
Put police's share in it as well.
Rs. 100.

1680
01:36:14,768 --> 01:36:15,712
Okay, sir.

1681
01:36:16,269 --> 01:36:18,909
This Rs. 100 is ours.

1682
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:19,940
The police department's.

1683
01:36:20,007 --> 01:36:21,680
Listen now..

1684
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:24,416
...he can marry anyone on this earth..
I don't have a problem with that..

1685
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:25,548
...or he can choose
even a ghost for instance..

1686
01:36:25,612 --> 01:36:27,990
I place a bet that he
won't marry the insurance girl at least...!!

1687
01:36:28,382 --> 01:36:32,728
Okay then, I am done for.
The government has defeated me.

1688
01:36:32,786 --> 01:36:33,696
Give me my money back.

1689
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,462
Hey! Hold on...!!

1690
01:36:36,523 --> 01:36:37,729
Bets once placed cannot
be taken back. - Right.

1691
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:39,771
Well done. Now he speaks.

1692
01:36:39,826 --> 01:36:41,669
So what happened next?

1693
01:36:44,831 --> 01:36:47,641
What should I say..
even I was fully prepared by now...!!

1694
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:48,839
Enough of preparations.

1695
01:36:48,902 --> 01:36:50,381
Now it's time for action.

1696
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:53,782
As soon as it is clear that
she is the our real Manpreet, kill her.

1697
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:57,552
See I have already arranged for that..

1698
01:36:58,011 --> 01:37:01,618
<i>I'll</i> look into her eyes,
say a few sweet words..

1699
01:37:02,282 --> 01:37:05,593
...set the atmosphere and
make her wear this necklace..

1700
01:37:05,652 --> 01:37:07,029
You don't need to
set such an atmosphere.

1701
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:08,560
Don't disturb me when
I am telling you the sweet plan.

1702
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:09,965
Otherwise, things don't work out.

1703
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:11,762
Fine, continue.

1704
01:37:13,693 --> 01:37:15,604
I will put this necklace
around her neck.

1705
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:18,704
I will turn her around and
look at her neck for the birthmark..

1706
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:20,707
And then I will shoot her.

1707
01:37:20,867 --> 01:37:22,437
I will shoot directly
at the birthmark itself.

1708
01:37:23,937 --> 01:37:25,416
It's a very nice necklace.

1709
01:37:25,705 --> 01:37:26,649
How much is it worth?

1710
01:37:26,706 --> 01:37:28,481
Rs. 85,000.

1711
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:30,718
Rs. 85,000? Who will pay the bill?

1712
01:37:30,844 --> 01:37:33,415
Hey! I am working for RAW.
Agency will pay the bill.

1713
01:37:33,713 --> 01:37:34,987
Madam, she is a very beautiful girl.

1714
01:37:35,048 --> 01:37:37,722
Before I kill her, I should
give her a good feeling at least, right?

1715
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:40,726
I am wondering..

1716
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:44,298
...we won't know where the
necklace will go after she is dead..

1717
01:37:44,724 --> 01:37:46,704
I suggest,
I should get it back for you.

1718
01:37:46,827 --> 01:37:48,898
Fine, as you wish.

1719
01:37:50,063 --> 01:37:52,475
I have to say no matter
how principled a woman is..

1720
01:37:52,532 --> 01:37:54,478
...she always gets soft
when she sees jewelry.

1721
01:37:55,802 --> 01:37:57,008
What a joke.

1722
01:37:57,437 --> 01:37:58,472
Get back to work.

1723
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:02,479
The bombshell is calling.

1724
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:04,447
Okay madam, bye.

1725
01:38:05,745 --> 01:38:08,658
Hello hottie, how are you doing?

1726
01:38:09,716 --> 01:38:12,322
You will live along life.

1727
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:14,591
I was just thinking about you.

1728
01:38:14,654 --> 01:38:15,792
You won't die for another
100 years I guess.

1729
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:17,866
Rest is upto God if
He is in mood to pick you early.

1730
01:38:18,091 --> 01:38:21,561
I thought I should ask whether
you will once again disappear..

1731
01:38:21,628 --> 01:38:23,005
...on me, after inviting me for coffee.

1732
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:24,872
I kept looking for you that day.

1733
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,812
You don't have to look for anymore.

1734
01:38:28,468 --> 01:38:29,776
Now I have found you.

1735
01:38:31,404 --> 01:38:33,850
It's nice that we are meeting today.

1736
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:36,750
You know, I had a lot of
stress on my mind in the morning.

1737
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:39,916
Oh my moon, my beautiful boon,
you just keep shining brightly..

1738
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,084
You don't need to take any stress?

1739
01:38:41,381 --> 01:38:43,054
I will take away all your stress.

1740
01:38:43,116 --> 01:38:45,596
Oh my God. Mr. Charming.

1741
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:48,859
You say such sweet things.
Now what else can I say?

1742
01:38:48,955 --> 01:38:50,525
I won't give you a chance to speak now..

1743
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:52,360
Only the silence will prevail...!!

1744
01:38:53,793 --> 01:38:55,397
What else have I ever done?

1745
01:38:55,595 --> 01:38:57,040
This is all I've done all my life.

1746
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:03,809
Time has come to fulfill
the vow I took 21 years ago.

1747
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:05,711
No, not like this.

1748
01:39:05,805 --> 01:39:08,081
Concentrate and read, only then
will you be able to memorize it.

1749
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:12,482
I, Mohammad Ram Singh Azad?

1750
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:14,388
Sir, what kind of a name is that?

1751
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:16,751
Ram Mohammad Singh Azad.

1752
01:39:18,818 --> 01:39:21,321
This is the name Shaheed Udham
Singh has told to the British.

1753
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:22,798
Brother, day after
tomorrow at the festival..

1754
01:39:22,856 --> 01:39:24,893
...there is a play on Udham Singh.

1755
01:39:26,092 --> 01:39:28,936
And he still cannot memorize
his share of dialogues.

1756
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:30,907
- Hello.
- Hi.

1757
01:39:31,731 --> 01:39:32,937
I am his school teacher.

1758
01:39:32,999 --> 01:39:34,876
I handle the dramatics
department in the school.

1759
01:39:35,001 --> 01:39:36,742
I am tired of making him memorize.

1760
01:39:36,903 --> 01:39:38,644
Now you can make an attempt.

1761
01:39:39,873 --> 01:39:44,117
Sir, this isn't my best friend's
essay which should be memorized.

1762
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:48,893
He was our community's martyr, Jaanu.

1763
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:50,619
You have to make
him dwell in your heart.

1764
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:52,027
You have to live his thoughts.

1765
01:39:52,419 --> 01:39:54,592
But I am still just a child, brother.

1766
01:39:54,754 --> 01:39:57,928
How will I understand everything?

1767
01:39:58,391 --> 01:40:00,371
Have you read about
the 1919's Baisakhi?

1768
01:40:00,827 --> 01:40:02,033
Jallianwala Bagh?

1769
01:40:03,363 --> 01:40:04,967
Udham Singh too was
just a child back then..

1770
01:40:05,298 --> 01:40:07,869
...when he took the vow
of Jallianwala Bagh's soil..

1771
01:40:08,001 --> 01:40:10,447
...that he will kill that
butcher General O'Dwyer..

1772
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:12,380
The one who had ordered the shootout.

1773
01:40:13,673 --> 01:40:14,651
After 21 years..

1774
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:17,746
...that brave man fulfilled
his vow in London's Caxton Hall.

1775
01:40:18,044 --> 01:40:20,024
He went to their country
and shot him there.

1776
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:22,827
He didn't feel scared
while doing all this?

1777
01:40:22,882 --> 01:40:24,759
Our martyrs have taught
us only one thing.

1778
01:40:24,951 --> 01:40:26,430
To fight for the truth and for our rights.

1779
01:40:26,586 --> 01:40:27,860
To stand against Injustice.

1780
01:40:27,921 --> 01:40:30,026
Neither to scare anyone
nor to be scared of anyone.

1781
01:40:35,996 --> 01:40:40,411
Hey...!! Death beckons you,
you sinful Englishman!

1782
01:40:41,067 --> 01:40:45,573
Today, after 21 years,
I am about to fulfill my vow.

1783
01:40:45,705 --> 01:40:48,914
I, Mohammad Ram Singh
Azad have come today..

1784
01:40:48,975 --> 01:40:51,956
...to seek revenge of the
atrocity done to my community.

1785
01:41:01,354 --> 01:41:03,732
You should not aim at your tenant who
is like your family member now.

1786
01:41:05,058 --> 01:41:07,834
Here you go, sir. I think
he understood the real meaning now.

1787
01:41:08,428 --> 01:41:09,566
Very good.

1788
01:41:15,568 --> 01:41:18,412
I always wish everyone
on their birthday..

1789
01:41:19,839 --> 01:41:22,012
But today no one
remembers my birthday.

1790
01:41:22,075 --> 01:41:26,319
Whether anyone else remember
it or not, how can I forget??

1791
01:41:26,446 --> 01:41:27,925
I can read hearts.

1792
01:41:32,786 --> 01:41:36,666
What if I was planning
on to surprise you...!!

1793
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:43,836
It takes time to find beautiful
gifts for beautiful girls.

1794
01:41:44,864 --> 01:41:45,808
W ow.

1795
01:41:45,865 --> 01:41:47,071
I love surprises.

1796
01:41:47,667 --> 01:41:48,975
Hurry up. I am waiting.

1797
01:41:49,502 --> 01:41:51,106
Okay sweetheart, you reach there.
I am coming.

1798
01:41:52,939 --> 01:41:54,577
You remembered?

1799
01:41:54,974 --> 01:41:56,578
Yes. What?

1800
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,621
How did you know that
today is my birthday?

1801
01:41:59,346 --> 01:42:01,690
Oh. You are so naive.

1802
01:42:01,781 --> 01:42:03,988
Doesn't he say that
he can read hearts?

1803
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:05,661
He must have read it already.

1804
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:07,823
Thanks.

1805
01:42:07,887 --> 01:42:09,662
- Should I wear it?
- Yes please go ahead.

1806
01:42:09,789 --> 01:42:11,325
No, it must be fine.

1807
01:42:11,725 --> 01:42:12,965
Let me wear it and show you.

1808
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,335
Wearing it won't change it.

1809
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:15,338
Shut up.

1810
01:42:24,704 --> 01:42:25,910
So my dear Jaanu, how dare you??

1811
01:42:26,406 --> 01:42:27,976
Sorry, brother.

1812
01:42:28,408 --> 01:42:32,982
How will you feel if no
one wishes you on your birthday?

1813
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,324
Just a little bit
of lie made her so happy.

1814
01:42:36,616 --> 01:42:40,462
Look, I acted smart I agree
but you should forgive me.

1815
01:42:40,687 --> 01:42:44,066
Otherwise, if you want,
<i>I'll</i> get your gift back right away.

1816
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:50,803
Let it be, she must have worn it by now.

1817
01:42:51,931 --> 01:42:53,501
Good "family member"

1818
01:43:05,011 --> 01:43:06,786
Let's cut the cake and get it over with.

1819
01:43:07,647 --> 01:43:09,354
It is her birthday or yours?

1820
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:11,292
At least let us light the candle first.

1821
01:43:11,651 --> 01:43:13,062
Where are you now?

1822
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:15,626
Coming. Wait.

1823
01:43:15,755 --> 01:43:16,961
- Come.
- I couldn't find the matchbox.

1824
01:43:17,023 --> 01:43:18,024
- Oh my.
- Here you go.

1825
01:43:19,959 --> 01:43:22,769
Happy birthday to you!

1826
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:26,606
Happy birthday to you!

1827
01:43:26,699 --> 01:43:28,838
My birthday is being
celebrated because of you.

1828
01:43:28,902 --> 01:43:30,506
Are you are not singing?

1829
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:32,682
I don't know how to sing.

1830
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:35,777
Great. As if we all
are trained singers here...!!

1831
01:43:36,042 --> 01:43:38,352
We consider you as a family member.

1832
01:43:38,511 --> 01:43:40,616
And yet you behave as a tenant only..

1833
01:43:40,947 --> 01:43:42,824
Sing. However you can, just sing ..

1834
01:43:42,882 --> 01:43:44,987
- Sing and get over with it.
- Come on, sing, son.

1835
01:43:55,962 --> 01:43:59,375
"May this day keep coming."

1836
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:03,280
"May this day keep going."

1837
01:44:03,603 --> 01:44:08,382
"May you live along life,
this is what I wish for."

1838
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:11,317
"Happy birthday to you!"

1839
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:14,559
"Happy birthday to you!"

1840
01:44:27,727 --> 01:44:29,035
Stood me up again...!!

1841
01:44:30,864 --> 01:44:32,070
Your parents deserve it before me...!!

1842
01:44:39,772 --> 01:44:41,308
Now you will have to eat it.

1843
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:48,017
Well, it is your birthday.
You should be the one eating it.

1844
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:49,486
Then do the honors please...

1845
01:44:52,085 --> 01:44:53,689
You guys enjoy, I am going.

1846
01:44:55,388 --> 01:44:56,867
I wanted to talk to you.

1847
01:44:57,323 --> 01:44:59,701
I wanted to apologise.

1848
01:45:00,527 --> 01:45:02,302
Yes, rightly so...!!

1849
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:07,942
Yes, I have always been
spoken bitterly with you.

1850
01:45:08,501 --> 01:45:10,037
I am sorry.

1851
01:45:11,437 --> 01:45:13,417
It's okay. You are my landlady.
It's your right to say whatever you like.

1852
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:16,420
Not anymore.. henceforth,
I am just "Keerat" for you..

1853
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:17,854
What?

1854
01:45:18,912 --> 01:45:20,050
Yes.

1855
01:45:20,313 --> 01:45:22,020
And thank you for this.

1856
01:45:22,682 --> 01:45:23,922
Beautiful, isn't it?

1857
01:45:26,553 --> 01:45:31,434
Oh my moon, my beautiful boon,
you keep on shining brightly..

1858
01:45:32,425 --> 01:45:33,563
These ornaments aren't of
any use to a moon like you..

1859
01:45:34,827 --> 01:45:36,363
Why don't you just remove
it and throw it on my face...!!

1860
01:45:38,064 --> 01:45:38,974
N eve r.

1861
01:45:39,899 --> 01:45:43,472
I will never remove it.
I will keep it close to my heart.

1862
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:45,647
Can I say something?

1863
01:45:45,905 --> 01:45:50,445
When I saw for the first time,
my heart said..

1864
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:53,513
"Oh my God,
how can something be so beautiful...!!"

1865
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:05,492
So, didn't I say
it will be the landlady eventually?

1866
01:46:05,692 --> 01:46:06,762
Give me the money.

1867
01:46:06,826 --> 01:46:09,830
Wait. She has just smiled.
She isn't hooked as yet.

1868
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:11,341
What do you mean by hooked?

1869
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:12,637
How many times do I have to tell you?

1870
01:46:12,832 --> 01:46:15,369
He doesn't know how to respect women.

1871
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:17,013
The word to use is "set".

1872
01:46:17,503 --> 01:46:18,777
- Lakha Singh.
- Sir.

1873
01:46:19,739 --> 01:46:21,582
Take the money. Let's leave.

1874
01:46:21,641 --> 01:46:23,587
Okay. Give it here.

1875
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:24,811
Wait, sir. The stow hasn't ended yet..

1876
01:46:24,877 --> 01:46:26,652
We still have that
foreigner bombshell left.

1877
01:46:26,779 --> 01:46:27,951
Who knows what turn
the stow will take further...?

1878
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:31,052
Except for the insurance girl alone,
if he elopes even with your wife..

1879
01:46:31,317 --> 01:46:32,694
...sir is bound to win.

1880
01:46:32,885 --> 01:46:35,593
Sir, if you want the money,
just ask for it.

1881
01:46:35,688 --> 01:46:37,361
At least don't cheat while gambling.

1882
01:46:37,423 --> 01:46:39,369
Really? You are getting very frank.

1883
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:40,995
You are gambling
in front of the police?

1884
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:42,370
You are very brave.

1885
01:46:42,428 --> 01:46:43,907
You too are a part of it, sir.

1886
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:45,468
You aren't playing
cricket here either.

1887
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:46,407
Hey!

1888
01:46:47,367 --> 01:46:48,903
Gambling is for normal public..

1889
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:52,744
Police just enjoys some fun and frolic.

1890
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:55,247
Thank you.

1891
01:46:55,308 --> 01:46:58,255
Give it to your boss.
You need to drive.

1892
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:01,353
I think he is smart.

1893
01:47:01,614 --> 01:47:03,389
Listen, I have an advice for you.

1894
01:47:03,516 --> 01:47:07,589
Forget these two girls.
Go for the foreigner.

1895
01:47:08,354 --> 01:47:09,992
You will get Canadian Visa straightaway..

1896
01:47:10,657 --> 01:47:12,694
She is upset with you.
You should go and cajole her.

1897
01:47:14,527 --> 01:47:20,603
"If you are the Disco queen
then I am the Bhangra king."

1898
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:21,675
Join me.

1899
01:47:21,734 --> 01:47:26,979
"If you are the Disco queen
then I am the Bhangra king."

1900
01:47:43,456 --> 01:47:44,526
How are you?

1901
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:46,069
I don't wanna talk to you.

1902
01:47:46,959 --> 01:47:48,632
Does dancing increase
the blood pressure?

1903
01:47:48,695 --> 01:47:49,435
Why?

1904
01:47:49,562 --> 01:47:51,439
My hottie seems to be very angry.

1905
01:47:51,597 --> 01:47:53,634
Anyone is bound to
get angry at a person like you.

1906
01:47:53,933 --> 01:47:54,741
Why?

1907
01:47:55,401 --> 01:47:56,311
Very funny.

1908
01:47:56,369 --> 01:47:57,404
As if you don't know.

1909
01:47:57,470 --> 01:47:58,813
You sometimes meet
and then just disappear.

1910
01:47:59,072 --> 01:48:00,415
You sometimes ask me
out and then don't show up.

1911
01:48:00,473 --> 01:48:02,077
I kept waiting for
you at the restaurant.

1912
01:48:02,475 --> 01:48:03,783
And I was so hungry also...!!

1913
01:48:04,043 --> 01:48:05,454
Okay!

1914
01:48:05,578 --> 01:48:07,489
So you are angry
because you are hungry.

1915
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:09,026
Tell me, what will you have?

1916
01:48:09,082 --> 01:48:10,755
Gyan's Lassi or Gyani's Tea?

1917
01:48:10,883 --> 01:48:12,829
If you want to eat Chole Bhature
then we need to go Pahadganj.

1918
01:48:12,885 --> 01:48:13,829
If you want to eat Matthi Cholle..

1919
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,092
...then we'll have to
go to telephone exchange.

1920
01:48:15,354 --> 01:48:16,856
If you want to try Pateesa,
Daal or Pinni..

1921
01:48:16,956 --> 01:48:18,367
...then we'll have
to go to Durgyana Temple.

1922
01:48:18,424 --> 01:48:19,869
If you want to eat at Kesar's
Dhaba then let me know..

1923
01:48:19,959 --> 01:48:21,597
If you want to eat at Bhrawaan
Da Dhaabe then let me know in advance..

1924
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:23,470
I will have to first call up there
as it is very crowded.

1925
01:48:23,529 --> 01:48:24,530
Hurry up now because
even I am feeling hungry...!!

1926
01:48:24,597 --> 01:48:25,439
Enough

1927
01:48:25,498 --> 01:48:27,375
You are an encyclopedia
on food as well!

1928
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,672
I don't eat all these things.

1929
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:30,338
You should eat.
It will make you healthy.

1930
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:32,041
Girls! Hello! That's enough. We need to talk
privately now.. go dress up and leave.

1931
01:48:32,105 --> 01:48:34,676
Get going now all of you...!!

1932
01:48:37,376 --> 01:48:38,855
You seem tired?

1933
01:48:39,412 --> 01:48:40,857
Why..you want to wrestle...??

1934
01:48:41,514 --> 01:48:42,584
Let it be. Or else you will say:

1935
01:48:42,648 --> 01:48:44,821
Ambarsariya, oh boy,
don't uproot the delicate buds.

1936
01:48:48,454 --> 01:48:49,524
Look what I brought.

1937
01:48:49,589 --> 01:48:52,502
Oh my God!
It's so beautiful.

1938
01:48:53,392 --> 01:48:55,394
- That's so sweet of you.
- Yeah.

1939
01:48:56,662 --> 01:48:57,732
Where did you get it from?

1940
01:49:05,872 --> 01:49:08,079
Don't ask me where did I get it from
I just got it anyhow...

1941
01:49:11,677 --> 01:49:12,621
why don't you make me wear it?

1942
01:50:02,995 --> 01:50:06,533
Really, whenever you are
close to me, I feel happy.

1943
01:50:06,866 --> 01:50:09,073
My life has been so complicated.

1944
01:50:09,335 --> 01:50:12,043
I have tried to keep myself
busy with documentaries.

1945
01:50:12,305 --> 01:50:13,613
...and dance and tried to stay normal.

1946
01:50:14,574 --> 01:50:18,420
But it's only you whose
presence gives me peace.

1947
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:22,722
Why is this stupid calling me again?

1948
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:26,863
I will file divorce papers
as soon as I go back to Canada.

1949
01:50:27,086 --> 01:50:28,326
Stupid.

1950
01:50:29,422 --> 01:50:30,366
Whose Divorce?

1951
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:32,596
Mine and Jass's..
Jaspreet, my husband.

1952
01:50:32,725 --> 01:50:34,727
I can't stay with him anymore.

1953
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:37,601
When life takes something from you,
it also gives you something in return.

1954
01:50:38,631 --> 01:50:40,474
Hold on babes, it doesn't
give anything just like that.

1955
01:50:40,533 --> 01:50:41,739
- It that your husband's call?
- Yeah.

1956
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:42,677
Let me talk to him.

1957
01:50:45,638 --> 01:50:46,548
Hello?

1958
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,347
From your voice,
I feel that you aren't handsome.

1959
01:50:50,042 --> 01:50:51,680
And from the way you just cursed..

1960
01:50:52,044 --> 01:50:54,547
...it also tells me that
you aren't smart either.

1961
01:50:55,414 --> 01:50:56,586
It's not you who is unfortunate..

1962
01:50:56,649 --> 01:50:58,720
She is the unlucky one that
you came into her life.

1963
01:50:58,885 --> 01:51:01,923
Beauty of your wife is incomparable..
you don't deserve her actually...!!

1964
01:51:02,355 --> 01:51:04,596
You should be thanking God,
but you are pushing her away instead.

1965
01:51:05,591 --> 01:51:07,571
She is fed up of you.

1966
01:51:07,693 --> 01:51:09,900
If you mess this up you
will have to give up Canada.

1967
01:51:12,431 --> 01:51:14,707
Use your brains and fall at her feet.

1968
01:51:15,434 --> 01:51:16,811
Or book a return ticket to India?

1969
01:51:16,969 --> 01:51:17,709
Do you understand...??

1970
01:51:18,871 --> 01:51:19,747
He's crying-

1971
01:51:19,805 --> 01:51:20,977
Crying?
- Yes.

1972
01:51:22,441 --> 01:51:23,442
Hello?

1973
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:25,455
Oh baby, don't cw.

1974
01:51:25,511 --> 01:51:26,387
Good.

1975
01:51:26,612 --> 01:51:28,091
Oh my God, baby I love you so much.

1976
01:51:28,347 --> 01:51:30,520
I am so sorry. No Jass..

1977
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:31,493
Hello!

1978
01:51:32,618 --> 01:51:34,598
Now what's the point of taking such
expensive gifts from strangers.

1979
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:35,621
- Now talk to him.
- Okay.

1980
01:51:35,688 --> 01:51:38,396
Why do you fight with me?
I love you so much.

1981
01:52:35,581 --> 01:52:36,753
Hello?

1982
01:52:38,451 --> 01:52:40,556
Good photography.

1983
01:54:19,418 --> 01:54:22,422
Everyone knows that Punjab is
the biggest strength of our country.

1984
01:54:22,521 --> 01:54:24,558
That's why it is targeted the most.

1985
01:54:24,723 --> 01:54:27,033
But today, thanks to you,
another danger was averted.

1986
01:54:27,693 --> 01:54:28,694
Madam, if that accident
hasn't taken place..

1987
01:54:28,761 --> 01:54:29,831
...then I would've caught him alive.

1988
01:54:29,995 --> 01:54:31,736
- But you did good.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1989
01:54:32,298 --> 01:54:34,437
We will get the postmortem
report by tomorrow morning.

1990
01:54:34,567 --> 01:54:35,978
But I think we have got our man.

1991
01:54:36,535 --> 01:54:37,775
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1992
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:41,748
Send the complete report
of the case to the head office.

1993
01:54:41,807 --> 01:54:43,946
- Okay, ma'am.
- This case is closed.

1994
01:54:45,344 --> 01:54:47,722
By the way,
both the girls are very beautiful.

1995
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,559
But who is the lucky one?

1996
01:54:51,617 --> 01:54:52,823
It's not so, ma'am.

1997
01:54:53,786 --> 01:54:56,027
I can see the truth in your eyes..

1998
01:54:56,655 --> 01:54:59,761
Hey now you want me to
fall in love and get married?

1999
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:02,803
So that you can tease me
about the diapers like I tease you?

2000
01:55:03,028 --> 01:55:04,666
But you forgot one thing, ma'am..

2001
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:05,708
What?

2002
01:55:06,265 --> 01:55:09,712
Always have cold food, take hot showers
and never get wheedled by girls..

2003
01:55:10,402 --> 01:55:12,575
...Ambarsariya Jatt
lives by this mantra...!!

2004
01:55:19,512 --> 01:55:20,650
You are leaving?

2005
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,689
Yes, I have got transfer orders.

2006
01:55:22,781 --> 01:55:23,851
I will have to leave.

2007
01:55:24,383 --> 01:55:25,555
Transfer orders?

2008
01:55:25,751 --> 01:55:29,289
Are you an insurance agent or an army
officer that you got transfer orders?

2009
01:55:29,355 --> 01:55:30,527
You won't leave.

2010
01:55:31,056 --> 01:55:34,333
I mean, you have paid
the rent for a year.

2011
01:55:34,527 --> 01:55:36,837
And you didn't even
stay here for a month.

2012
01:55:37,496 --> 01:55:39,840
Tell the company that if you
keep wasting your money like this..

2013
01:55:39,899 --> 01:55:41,310
...then how will you get your own house?

2014
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:42,937
You cannot keep wasting money on rent.

2015
01:55:43,903 --> 01:55:46,850
I am talking to you
and you are busy packing.

2016
01:55:47,606 --> 01:55:49,608
I wanted to tell
you something important.

2017
01:55:52,511 --> 01:55:53,546
Tell me.

2018
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:56,751
You say that you can read hearts.

2019
01:55:57,283 --> 01:55:58,785
Why don't you read it and tell me?

2020
01:56:02,788 --> 01:56:03,994
You like someone?

2021
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:06,333
Yes.

2022
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:08,664
Who is that poor guy?

2023
01:56:10,029 --> 01:56:11,667
Someone crazy.

2024
01:56:12,031 --> 01:56:13,806
But he is very good at heart.

2025
01:56:14,867 --> 01:56:16,710
He used to fight with me a lot.

2026
01:56:16,769 --> 01:56:18,009
This is how it happens.

2027
01:56:19,738 --> 01:56:21,809
She too used to fight with me a lot.

2028
01:56:22,841 --> 01:56:25,720
She used to be very bitter
with me in the beginning..

2029
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:28,986
Then I didn't release when I slowly
started falling in love with her.

2030
01:56:31,951 --> 01:56:33,897
Now the problem is,
I don't know how to tell her.

2031
01:56:36,322 --> 01:56:37,858
You don't need to think
that much actually...

2032
01:56:38,624 --> 01:56:40,331
Just tell her.

2033
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:43,337
Who knows she might already
be waiting for this moment..

2034
01:56:47,433 --> 01:56:48,810
What if she rejects me?

2035
01:56:51,503 --> 01:56:52,538
Just say it.. don't worry..

2036
01:56:58,711 --> 01:56:59,655
I love you...!!

2037
01:57:11,724 --> 01:57:12,862
Shall I go and tell her that?

2038
01:57:15,928 --> 01:57:17,373
Hold on.

2039
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:27,308
Isn't she beautiful?

2040
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:32,345
She is beautiful.

2041
01:57:33,012 --> 01:57:33,990
And lucky too.

2042
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:42,465
You read her heart,
but now what about other hearts?

2043
01:57:47,326 --> 01:57:49,636
Well, I guess others are
nothing more than a joke..

2044
01:59:14,747 --> 01:59:15,885
What, man!

2045
01:59:16,548 --> 01:59:18,459
You ruined everything in the end.

2046
01:59:20,853 --> 01:59:25,063
I feel like getting you
locked up behind the bars...!!

2047
01:59:28,927 --> 01:59:31,669
Come on, everyone take
your money back and disperse..

2048
01:59:32,030 --> 01:59:32,872
Come on.

2049
01:59:34,533 --> 01:59:36,035
Usually people blame the
Police for being harsh and rude..

2050
01:59:36,468 --> 01:59:38,448
But we merely break bones ..

2051
01:59:39,104 --> 01:59:41,550
Whereas you broke hearts there..
not even one..but two loving hearts.

2052
01:59:43,942 --> 01:59:45,478
Shame on you heartbreaker!

2053
01:59:47,813 --> 01:59:49,952
Whenever I narrated this stow to anyone..

2054
01:59:53,552 --> 01:59:56,328
...no one could understand
what this Ambarsariya went through...

2055
01:59:58,824 --> 02:00:00,531
Not just the two.. but three hearts..

2056
02:00:02,928 --> 02:00:04,066
...were broken that day.

2057
02:00:49,808 --> 02:00:50,616
Hello.

2058
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:52,047
Bad news.

2059
02:00:52,110 --> 02:00:53,487
We have got the postmortem report.

2060
02:00:53,545 --> 02:00:55,320
...and there is no
birthmark on the dead body.

2061
02:00:55,681 --> 02:00:56,716
He is not our Manpreet.

2062
02:00:56,815 --> 02:00:57,953
The real Manpreet is still alive.

2063
02:00:58,016 --> 02:00:58,858
What?

2064
02:00:59,718 --> 02:01:00,822
But what about the one who is dead?

2065
02:01:00,886 --> 02:01:03,332
Remember in the previous mission we
had sent you behind five terrorists..

2066
02:01:03,388 --> 02:01:04,526
...and you eliminated four of them?

2067
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:05,568
He was the fifth one.

2068
02:01:05,624 --> 02:01:06,932
He was following you everywhere.

2069
02:01:06,992 --> 02:01:09,336
And he was keeping an
eye on your every moment.

2070
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:26,355
Today is 13th April.

2071
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:29,681
Minister must be on
his way to the function.

2072
02:01:29,882 --> 02:01:31,327
Not just the minister..

2073
02:01:31,383 --> 02:01:33,920
Even the real Manpreet who
will shoot him must've reached there.

2074
02:01:34,453 --> 02:01:35,431
Do something.

2075
02:03:09,548 --> 02:03:10,788
Brother!!

2076
02:03:10,983 --> 02:03:13,395
Hey Jaanu! How are you?

2077
02:03:13,452 --> 02:03:15,056
Everyone said that you have left.

2078
02:03:15,354 --> 02:03:18,801
But I knew you would surely
come to wish me good luck.

2079
02:03:18,857 --> 02:03:20,598
I am going to perform today
in this Baisakhi function.

2080
02:03:20,726 --> 02:03:22,603
How could I have missed
Jaanu's performance?

2081
02:03:51,023 --> 02:03:54,095
What is it?
You seem to be in quite a hurry.

2082
02:03:54,526 --> 02:03:56,472
- Have you performed already?
- No, sir. Mine is next.

2083
02:03:56,561 --> 02:03:58,598
Fine. Okay. Good luck.

2084
02:03:58,897 --> 02:04:00,001
Do good.

2085
02:04:05,037 --> 02:04:06,414
Excuse me, sir.

2086
02:04:07,739 --> 02:04:08,740
Yes?

2087
02:04:11,009 --> 02:04:11,953
RAW?

2088
02:04:12,611 --> 02:04:14,420
Sir, the home minister's
life is in danger.

2089
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:17,483
We have information that he
will be attacked today at this function.

2090
02:04:17,849 --> 02:04:18,759
What?

2091
02:04:20,318 --> 02:04:21,626
The intelligence's
report is confirmed.

2092
02:04:22,287 --> 02:04:23,664
And the killer is already here.

2093
02:04:24,956 --> 02:04:27,493
We still don't know who he is..
we just know his name...!!

2094
02:04:31,563 --> 02:04:32,439
Come.

2095
02:04:32,864 --> 02:04:34,002
Come with me.

2096
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:54,726
This is a limit!

2097
02:04:54,886 --> 02:04:55,728
This is totally unacceptable...!!

2098
02:04:55,787 --> 02:04:56,993
Is this a joke?

2099
02:04:57,789 --> 02:04:59,996
You should have informed us.

2100
02:05:00,358 --> 02:05:01,928
I wouldn't have brought the minister here.

2101
02:05:02,828 --> 02:05:04,830
Sir, we thought that
we had eliminated the threat.

2102
02:05:05,597 --> 02:05:07,042
But the threat is still there.

2103
02:05:07,933 --> 02:05:09,844
Punjab's drug mafia is behind all this.

2104
02:05:09,935 --> 02:05:12,040
This evil drug problem...!!

2105
02:05:12,704 --> 02:05:13,842
Disgusting.

2106
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:16,516
There is such a tight security here.

2107
02:05:16,975 --> 02:05:18,477
RAW itself is involved in it.

2108
02:05:18,577 --> 02:05:23,754
In spite of all this.. you think Manpreet
will come here and shoot at him...??

2109
02:05:24,282 --> 02:05:25,317
No.

2110
02:05:26,051 --> 02:05:27,724
Not Possible...!!

2111
02:05:28,053 --> 02:05:29,396
It is possible, sir.

2112
02:05:30,355 --> 02:05:32,961
When household's own Dog colludes with the
Thieves then anything is possible...!!

2113
02:05:34,526 --> 02:05:36,528
I don't understand.

2114
02:05:37,062 --> 02:05:39,542
You already understand everything sir..
Without me having to tell you anything...

2115
02:05:39,731 --> 02:05:41,472
...you already know
that the killer's name is Manpreet.

2116
02:05:50,041 --> 02:05:51,782
See my boy.. I understand..

2117
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:55,254
But the minister doesn't understand.

2118
02:05:55,447 --> 02:05:56,858
Plan is not just to kill him..

2119
02:05:57,015 --> 02:05:58,494
But to spread a strong message
down everyone's spine..

2120
02:05:58,650 --> 02:06:01,859
The Honesty that he is sticking to,
we want to get rid of that...!!

2121
02:06:02,454 --> 02:06:05,435
His honestly has ruined
our illegal incomes...!!

2122
02:06:06,558 --> 02:06:11,871
Such honest person should
be taught a lesson then, right?

2123
02:06:13,765 --> 02:06:14,800
What do you say?

2124
02:06:16,768 --> 02:06:18,042
Rightly said...!!

2125
02:06:18,703 --> 02:06:19,841
Having cold food,
Taking hot showers..

2126
02:06:19,905 --> 02:06:21,543
...and Teaching our
enemies a strict lesson...!!

2127
02:06:21,873 --> 02:06:23,682
These are three principles
all Ambarsariya people follow...!!

2128
02:06:24,409 --> 02:06:26,411
And now when I'm here, how can anyone
come and shoot at the Minister like that??

2129
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:28,987
It's not a child's play, sir.

2130
02:06:31,383 --> 02:06:33,363
It is easier than
a child's play my son...!!

2131
02:06:34,853 --> 02:06:36,992
And today no one can
stop this bullet from being fired...!!

2132
02:06:38,557 --> 02:06:40,002
Take care of him.

2133
02:06:57,709 --> 02:07:00,713
Jo Bole So Nihaal...

2134
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:03,817
Sat Shri Akaal...!!

2135
02:07:25,036 --> 02:07:28,609
And now it's time for a
special performance by the kids.

2136
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:32,313
Our Home Minister is also
going to motivate them through it.

2137
02:07:32,544 --> 02:07:35,855
So I would request Honorable Home
Minister to please join us on the stage...

2138
02:07:36,014 --> 02:07:38,790
...and become a child
with these children.

2139
02:07:39,918 --> 02:07:43,559
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give him a huge round of applause.

2140
02:07:43,622 --> 02:07:44,896
Please come, sir.

2141
02:07:46,625 --> 02:07:47,865
Come, sir. Come.

2142
02:07:49,594 --> 02:07:50,868
Hello.

2143
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:57,375
No, what are you doing?

2144
02:07:57,435 --> 02:07:58,846
At least try.

2145
02:07:59,070 --> 02:08:01,482
As you say.

2146
02:08:05,477 --> 02:08:10,620
Ladies and gentlemen, please give him
a huge round of applause.

2147
02:08:16,421 --> 02:08:19,368
Oh no, he forgot his book over here.

2148
02:08:19,624 --> 02:08:20,728
Manpreet is so careless.

2149
02:08:41,713 --> 02:08:44,592
Oh God, the act has already begun.

2150
02:08:44,649 --> 02:08:46,686
Manpreet is about to enter the stage.

2151
02:08:49,554 --> 02:08:50,965
It's okay, madam.

2152
02:08:52,057 --> 02:08:54,936
Now that we have sent
the Udham Singh on the stage..

2153
02:08:55,293 --> 02:08:57,534
...he will return only
after getting the job done.

2154
02:08:58,396 --> 02:09:00,637
We have made the minister..

2155
02:09:00,699 --> 02:09:04,670
...O'Dwyer for a reason, after all..
It's all planned out..

2156
02:09:14,512 --> 02:09:16,958
Oh, Manpreet has entered
the stage already...!!

2157
02:09:32,597 --> 02:09:33,701
Manpreet?

2158
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:36,570
Your Jaanu.

2159
02:09:36,735 --> 02:09:38,874
Look, he forgot the book over here.

2160
02:09:46,544 --> 02:09:50,890
Which book is he carrying then
if he has forgotten his book here?

2161
02:09:59,457 --> 02:10:02,495
Death beckons you,
you sinful Englishman!

2162
02:10:06,031 --> 02:10:07,066
'What's your name?'

2163
02:10:07,399 --> 02:10:09,504
'My name in the school papers
is something else..'

2164
02:10:09,567 --> 02:10:12,548
'..but everyone addresses me as Jaanu.'

2165
02:10:13,972 --> 02:10:19,479
Today, after 21 years,
I am about to fulfill my vow.

2166
02:10:22,714 --> 02:10:26,526
'After 21 years, that brave man fulfilled
his vow in London's Caxton Hall.'

2167
02:10:26,618 --> 02:10:28,359
'He went to his country and shot him.'

2168
02:10:46,905 --> 02:10:50,853
'There is a birthmark
on the real Manpreet's neck.'

2169
02:10:53,044 --> 02:10:57,322
'Brother, day after tomorrow at the
festival there is a play on Udham Singh.'

2170
02:11:00,351 --> 02:11:02,297
'It is indeed a child's play...!!"

2171
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:03,860
'To fire the bullet.'

2172
02:11:06,424 --> 02:11:08,461
Udham Singh, shoot him.

2173
02:11:08,526 --> 02:11:11,803
I, Ram Mohammad Singh
Azad have come today..

2174
02:11:11,863 --> 02:11:14,844
...to seek revenge of the
atrocity done to my community.

2175
02:11:21,973 --> 02:11:24,920
Community and Sardaari are
more important than one's life.

2176
02:11:28,346 --> 02:11:30,383
These were the thoughts
of Sardaar Udham Singh.

2177
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:38,533
Son..listen to me..

2178
02:11:39,491 --> 02:11:42,472
Udham Singh didn't think that
long while pulling the trigger..

2179
02:11:42,694 --> 02:11:43,832
21 years..

2180
02:11:44,629 --> 02:11:47,576
He kept the fire of revenge
burning in his heart for 21 long years.

2181
02:11:49,567 --> 02:11:52,605
He found General O'Dwyer, he went to their
country and shot him then and there...!!

2182
02:11:55,874 --> 02:11:57,547
I'm telling you to shoot him...!!

2183
02:11:57,642 --> 02:11:59,815
The Generals of Community
don't take orders like this...!!

2184
02:11:59,878 --> 02:12:01,619
They make their own decisions...!!

2185
02:12:03,982 --> 02:12:05,552
Like Shaheed Udham Singh made his own...!!

2186
02:12:09,687 --> 02:12:10,961
I said FIRE...!!!

2187
02:12:12,657 --> 02:12:15,035
Exactly these orders
echoed in Jallianwala Bagh...!!

2188
02:12:15,894 --> 02:12:18,340
That Butcher O'Dwyer ordered to "FIRE"

2189
02:12:18,496 --> 02:12:20,533
O'Dwyer, yes.. he is O'Dwyer.

2190
02:12:20,665 --> 02:12:21,700
Look here.

2191
02:12:21,866 --> 02:12:23,539
Shoot at him, son. Shoot at him.

2192
02:12:23,635 --> 02:12:25,376
Look, O'Dwyer is standing before you.

2193
02:12:25,637 --> 02:12:26,809
Likes of O'Dwyer don't have the courage..

2194
02:12:26,871 --> 02:12:28,043
...to stand in front of the gun
and yet smile ...!!

2195
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:31,946
The real O'Dwyer was the one
who stood scared before Udham Singh.

2196
02:12:40,685 --> 02:12:43,029
He is the real
O'Dwyer who "orders" to SHOOT...!!

2197
02:12:43,354 --> 02:12:45,732
SHOOT at him, son. SHOOT at him!

2198
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:53,572
He is the real
O'Dwyer who orders to "FIRE"

2199
02:12:54,966 --> 02:12:56,843
I said FIRE...!!

2200
02:13:00,271 --> 02:13:01,648
FIRE...!!

2201
02:13:22,961 --> 02:13:26,306
Death beckons you,
you sinful Englishman!

2202
02:13:27,332 --> 02:13:31,872
Today, after 21 years,
I am about to fulfill my vow!

2203
02:13:35,039 --> 02:13:38,316
I, Ram Mohammad Singh
Azad have come today..

2204
02:13:38,376 --> 02:13:40,913
...to seek revenge of the
atrocity done to my community!

2205
02:13:54,993 --> 02:13:56,370
Amazing!

2206
02:13:56,561 --> 02:13:58,666
He got trapped in his own trap.

2207
02:13:58,730 --> 02:14:01,301
Hey, they didn't know they were messing
with someone..

2208
02:14:01,366 --> 02:14:02,936
...who can outsmart them anytime.

2209
02:14:03,501 --> 02:14:06,004
But they played such a big
trick around an innocent child.

2210
02:14:06,371 --> 02:14:09,682
And the child wasn't even aware that
he was holding a real gun and not a toy.

2211
02:14:10,308 --> 02:14:11,810
But still Jaanu made the right decision.

2212
02:14:11,909 --> 02:14:14,048
He shot at the PA on his left thigh.

2213
02:14:14,512 --> 02:14:17,425
He has made such a cunning scheme.

2214
02:14:18,049 --> 02:14:20,620
Someone from the school
had to surely be involved in it.

2215
02:14:25,456 --> 02:14:27,299
Don't you remember the school teacher?

2216
02:14:28,293 --> 02:14:29,966
The one who was helping
with Jaanu's rehearsals?

2217
02:14:34,699 --> 02:14:35,677
'Hello.'

2218
02:14:37,835 --> 02:14:40,748
'Now that we have sent
Sardaar Udham Singh on the stage..'

2219
02:14:41,806 --> 02:14:43,979
'..he will return only
after getting the job done.'

2220
02:14:49,614 --> 02:14:51,059
Oh yes..

2221
02:15:02,327 --> 02:15:04,568
You consider yourself
to be a great hero..

2222
02:15:04,829 --> 02:15:06,934
But the main pawn managed
to get out of your hands.

2223
02:15:07,498 --> 02:15:09,444
And you talk like a commando.

2224
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:11,773
But you couldn't even catch a teacher.

2225
02:15:12,036 --> 02:15:13,811
- Sukhi..
- Coming.

2226
02:15:14,005 --> 02:15:15,985
Make this a rule henceforth.

2227
02:15:16,374 --> 02:15:19,287
Never drink with such a loser.

2228
02:15:19,344 --> 02:15:22,348
Even if it's for free or if he
is paying you to have a drink with him.

2229
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:23,650
Let it be.

2230
02:15:23,981 --> 02:15:26,518
You have been spinning
a tale from quite some time now.

2231
02:15:26,818 --> 02:15:28,559
Hats off to you, bro.

2232
02:15:30,388 --> 02:15:31,924
He lies a lot.

2233
02:16:40,491 --> 02:16:40,901
Mr. Teacher...

2234
02:16:40,958 --> 02:16:42,062
...you have been quite busy making
that innocent child rehearse those lines..

2235
02:16:42,326 --> 02:16:43,896
...but yet you didn't understand
the real meaning of that story...!!

2236
02:16:44,629 --> 02:16:47,974
Shaheed Udham Singh didn't
just shoot his enemy..

2237
02:16:50,334 --> 02:16:52,075
...he hunted him down
and then shot him...!!

2238
02:17:08,286 --> 02:17:11,495
Spare my life, bro.
I didn't see anything.

2239
02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:13,826
I won't tell anyone about you.

2240
02:17:16,427 --> 02:17:17,838
You can't tell even if you want to...

2241
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:20,832
Actually if you think hard..
you still don't know my name...!!

2242
02:17:28,906 --> 02:17:29,850
His name?

2243
02:17:31,876 --> 02:17:33,719
What was his name?

2244
02:17:36,581 --> 02:17:39,790
'To have cold food, take hot showers
and never get wheedled by girls.'

2245
02:17:39,851 --> 02:17:41,990
'These three things define me.'

2246
02:17:44,889 --> 02:17:46,562
'Ambarsariya! Come here.'

2247
02:17:46,624 --> 02:17:47,898
'You are here, big-brother.'

2248
02:17:47,959 --> 02:17:48,994
'A family member!'

2249
02:17:55,867 --> 02:17:58,313
'Hello? Who are you?'

2250
02:17:58,603 --> 02:17:59,673
'I am an Agent.'

2251
02:18:00,037 --> 02:18:01,380
'An Insurance Agent.'

2252
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:02,941
'Look there is your Super Hero.'

2253
02:18:03,307 --> 02:18:04,445
'Madam, what else have I done?'

2254
02:18:04,575 --> 02:18:05,713
'This is all I have done my entire life.'

2255
02:18:05,810 --> 02:18:06,914
'I am an Insurance Agent.'
