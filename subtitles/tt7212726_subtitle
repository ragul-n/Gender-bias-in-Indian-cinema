00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,960
'Miramar Police station.'

3
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
'There's just been an encounter here.'

4
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,560
'This encounter is off records.'

5
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,720
'But this is the first honest deed'

6
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
'by the officer-in-charge
of this station.'

the same place I once did.'

'While I was striving
to be an honest cop, '

10
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,680
'there was a kid who
wanted to be just like me.'

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,360
'But, his intentions
were completely different.'

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,080
What...

13
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,120
Picking pockets at your age.

14
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,440
What...

15
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Don't you feel ashamed?

16
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,800
Hey, anywhere is fine,
but not on my head.

17
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,320
What? Who are you?

18
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,960
- Simmba!
- Simmba?

19
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,360
What kind of a name is that?

20
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,640
Simmba is a shortform.
My full name is Sangram Bhalerao.

21
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,720
You guys have no clue who I work for.

22
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,400
- Who?
- Lokhande.

23
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,480
When he gets here,
you will all be shaking in your boots.

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,720
- Deshpande sir, hello.
- How are you, Lokhande?

25
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,240
Hello, Gaikwad sir.

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,320
- How are you, Lokhande?
- All well, sir.

27
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,480
Sir, he's one of my boys.

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Let him go.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Is he Lokhande?

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,680
- How dare you make orphans pickpocket.
- Sir, sir...

31
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,800
You bloody...

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,440
Sir, sir, sir, let it go now.

33
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,760
Stop humiliating me in front of the kid.

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,080
Sir... Take this.

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,560
- Get lost!
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,640
Come on.

37
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,280
What are you staring at me for?

38
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,200
You always said you're a powerful guy.

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,080
But he snatched your money.

40
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,080
Because he's more powerful than I am.

41
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
And do you know why?

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,880
Because he's got a uniform.

43
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,240
And anyone who dons this
uniform controls everything.

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
What are you looking at?

45
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Just that

46
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,040
picking pockets for a loser like you
won't do any wonders for my career.

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,960
Now even I want to be powerful.

48
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,080
- And there's only one thing I want.
- What?

49
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,240
Uniform! Police Uniform!

50
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
Understand!

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,640
'Since that day,
Simmba made up his mind'

52
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,640
'that he'll become a Police Officer
when he grows up.'

53
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
'Simmba was an orphan.'

54
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,800
'But studying, and getting a degree
was very crucial.'

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,040
'And a night school teacher
Gayatri helped Simmba with it.'

56
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,200
'Simmba considered Gayatri
as his elder sister.'

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,920
'Simmba focused on his studies
at night.'

58
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,720
'During the day, he worked hard and
earned money with dishonesty.'

59
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,000
Andaz Apna Apna Showing now.
Only for 40 rupees.

60
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,640
Buy one, it's a fantastic movie.

61
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,240
Only 40 rupees.

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,560
Hey Shortie,
go sell your tickets somewhere else.

63
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,360
This is Durva Ranade's area.

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,680
You know what, tell your Durva Ranade
to meet me after 5.

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,600
I'll see what I can do.

66
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,000
He speaks a bit too much.

67
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
You bloody...

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,040
There's five of you, and I am all alone.

69
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,800
But whoever strikes first
I will definitely break his bone.

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,120
What...

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,480
Size medium, and guts extra-large.

72
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
Go on. From today, this
theatre is your area.

73
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,280
Boss, you're giving the
entire area to this little kid.

74
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,040
Then why didn't you step up?

75
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,560
You thought he will kill you.

76
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,720
You thought right.

77
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,720
He would've killed you.

78
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,080
He's like a little cracker
waiting to explode one day.

79
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,480
Will you work for me?

80
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,720
I've already decided my future.

81
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,000
I see. What will you
do when you grow up?

82
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,440

115
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,960
You fool.

116
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,400
First of all, you commit a
crime in Inspector Bhalerao's area.

117
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,520
Plus you stole Five million.

118
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,520
Bloody thief!

119
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,800
No, sir. We haven't done anything.

120
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,400
Dagdu. Don't pamper me.

121
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,760
Otherwise, my temper will hamper you.

122
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,240
- Mhatre.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,560
These days everyone's running
after gold.

124
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
Even Aamir Khan wanted Gold in 'Dangal',

125
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,440
but he wanted to win it,
and not steal it.

126
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
You made a big mistake.

127
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,056
You won't be seeing
daylight anytime soon.

128
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,880
According to my calculation, you'll
be serving time for at least 10 years.

129
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,840
I was saying, let's arrive on some
kind of mutual understanding on this.

130
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,200
- And, we're prepared to pay some money.
- Hey!

131
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,800
I am only hungry for love, not money.

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,080
And I love only money.

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,280
Meaning?

134
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,840
I mean, it's against my principles,
but imagine that I agree.

135
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
If I have to take some money from you,
then how much cash do you guys have?

136
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,800
1,00,000, sir!

137
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,880
And, if you're willing to give
something, then how much can you give?

138
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,040
Sir, 25,000.

139
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,200
- How much?
- Sir, 25,000.

140
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
- How much?
- Sir, 25,000.

141
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,720
So 25+25+25.
That means, I get 75,000.

142
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,680
Mind blowing. Done.

143
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,000
- Hey!
- Hey!

144
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,616
Open your mouth again,
and I'll lock you all up.

145
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,800
- Mhatre.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,720
Listen, we'll also have to take
from the man whose store they robbed.

147
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,640
- You mean 'give'.
- Not give, 'take'.

148
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,440
- What's his name?
- Hasmukh Parekh.

149
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,480
Oh, Hasmukh!

150
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,880
Superb. Superb. Superb.

151
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,600
Brother, you've completely
changed that saying.

152
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,040
One knockout is better than 100 punches.

153
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,720
Honestly speaking,
I had stopped expecting.

154
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,960
Don't lie, Hasmukh.
You look like you're expecting.

155
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,280
- Mhatre.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,840
Collect the receipt of all
the things and hand them over.

157
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
What? - All this belongs to you,
doesn't it, Hasmukh.

158
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,160
So we need receipts for Police records.

159
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,040
- It is a formula.
- Sir, formality.

160
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,600
Yes, a formality.

161
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,160
You see, brother, I have a receipt
for 50% of the stuff, but the rest...

162
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
What?

163
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,600
- That means, the rest of it is illegal.
- No.

164
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,840
- Are you betraying your own country?
- No.

165
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,600
No! No!

166
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,960
One who troubles me
doesn't escape my wrath.

167
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,520
Mhatre, arrest him.

168
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,240
- Arrest him.
- No. No.

169
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,200
No, please let him go.

170
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,640
What' the point in screaming
aloud now, sister-in-law Laxmi?

171
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,640
He's committed such a big
crime, now he's in big trouble.

172
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,920
Once you get arrested my sister-in-law

173
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,120
will go crazy strolling
in these halls all alone.

174
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,720
Mhatre, he didn't even think
what will happen to the kid

175
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
and sister-in-law when he's in jail.

176
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,440
You're there.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,840
I mean, you're there to
save us from this trouble.

178
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,520
Take my advice, sir.

179
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,080
You should settle this matter
right here with some money.

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,200
Brother, just a minute.

181
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,920
I was saying, let's settle this.

182
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,160
- Hey!
- Brother,

183
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,600
think about my son Kalpesh.

184
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,920
Or, just listen to
your sister-in-law Laxmi.

185
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,680
Please!

186
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,560
I can never say no to Laxmi.

187
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,920
Don't mind sir, but can I say something?

188
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,640
We're thugs, thieves, and cons.

189
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,720
But I've never come across
a notorious thug like you.

190
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,720
Dagdu, tell me something I don't know.

191
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,320
This is the 21st century.

192
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,000
People have only one interest.

193
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,720
Their own.

194
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,800

219
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,120
Neha.

220
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,480
- Brother.
- How are you?

221
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,280
I am fine.
How about you?

222
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,296
- Where's your father?
- Father will be here shortly.

223
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
Take a seat until then.

224
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,520
What do you keep studying all day?

225
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,520
My exams are around the corner.
I'll have to study.

226
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,040
Why didn't you say that before?

227
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,040
I'll oust your exam papers.

228
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,880
Brother, oust my papers?

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,400
- Simmba, what are you saying?
- Brother. It was just a joke.

230
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,880
You say, why did you call me
so urgently? What's the matter?

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,400
- Neha, tell your mother to serve food.
- Yes.

232
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,080
I wanted to speak with you urgently.

233
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,840
I am transferring you from
Shivgadh to Miramar Police Station.

234
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,240
Miramar.

235
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,800
Mind blowing, brother.
Miramar is a gold mine.

236
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,760
Yes, yes, do as you please,
but you must listen to me carefully.

237
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,320
You must stay wary of the man who got
the previous inspector transferred.

238
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
You must be careful.

239
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,960
He's an important man.

240
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,960
Durva Ranade.

241
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,800
You can say that Goa's pretty much
known for him, and not the other way.

242
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,520
He runs an illegal business
but never crosses anyone's path.

243
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,480
But if someone crosses his path,
he doesn't live to tell.

244
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,240
So never cross Durva Ranade's path.

245
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,480
Durva Ranade is my God.

246
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,800
I exist because he does.

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,520
Miramar.

248
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,400
'Simmba had headed for Miramar.'

249
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,360
'But least did he know'

250
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,040
'that this journey
would change his life.'

251
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,680
Sir has arrived. Here he is.

252
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,880
- Sir.
- Yes.

253
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,640
- Sir, Inspector Santosh Tawde.
- Tawde.

254
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,400
- Sir, Alok Borkar.
- Borkar.

255
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,280
Very good, very good.

256
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
I have a question.

257
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,760
Who is she?

258
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,320
Her?

259
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,320
That's lyer Aunty.

260
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,960
65 complete, 66 running.

261
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,680
Not on your left,
who is that on the right?

262
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,680
You mean her. That's Shagun.

263
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,480
She runs the Good Food Catering Service.

264
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,160
Buddy, Miramar is already mind-blowing.

265
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Thank you, sir.

266
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,256
Well, now that I am here,
We might as well do some work.

267
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Sir, this way.

268
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,840
Sir. That's the control room.

269
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,120
Your cabin's right in front.

270
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,480
From Dona Paula to Panjim,

271
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,960
five beat-stations come under
our Police Station.

272
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,960
- How many cameras?
- Just one?

273
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,960
- And in my cabin?
- None.

274
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,280
- Mind-blowing.
- Thank you, sir.

275
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,760
Head Constable Nityanand Mohile.

276
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,720
Won't you salute your senior?

277
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,080
My hands hurting.

278
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,480
I know where it's really hurting you.

279
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
I've heard a lot about you, Mohile.

280
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,480
Even I have heard a lot about you, sir.

281
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,320
Oh! Taunt.

282
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,440
But...

283
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,480
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> The day shall come <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

284
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,040
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> when you'll raise your hand. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

285
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,080
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> You will salute me. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

286
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,480
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> And salute me every
time I come and go. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

287
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,800
Mohile, since you're
giving me such a dry look,

288
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,560
you will be my driver from now on.

289
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,840
You will drive my car.

290
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,640
You see, even my hand's hurting.

291
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,440
Honestly.

292
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,120
Sir, this way.

293
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,320
- Tawde.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,520
- Anything to eat?
- Well, sir, that's up to you.

295
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,560
I was talking about food.

296
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,160
Sir, I'll treat you to some great food,
and you won't stop licking your fingers.

297
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,520
Come on, lunch break.

298
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,360
- Tawde brother. Wash your hands.
- Of course. Of course.

299
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,080
Enough, Mohile uncle.
Work later, it's a lunch break.

300
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,360
- How are you, Shagun?
- All well.

301
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,760
Your lunch box.

302
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
- By the way, there's good news for you.
- What?

303
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,440
No sweets for you anymore.

304
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Why?

305
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,880
Why? because Nandini called me.

306
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,081
She was saying that the doctor has
increased your dosage for diabetes.

307
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,360
And you didn't tell me.

308
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,000
And so, no more sweets for you.

309
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,720
That Nandini is more like
my mother than my daughter.

310
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,720
- Are you complaining?
- No...

311
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,720
- Eat your lunch.
- Yes.

312
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,280
Iyer aunty, you forgot to
put fish in the fish curry again.

313
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,680
I forgot.

314
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,080
Look carefully, it must be in there.

315
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,240
Aunty, this is my lunch box and not the
ocean where I'll have to find the fish.

316
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,640
Borkar uncle, why are you laughing?

317
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,880
Aunty had called me.

318
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,000
And she said that you're
on a strict diet from today.

319
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,160
So only salad for you.

320
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,960
- This is not fair. Only salad.
- Yes.

321
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,680
- Your bloody aunty...
- Uncle.

322
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,360
Please don't do this.

323
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,920
I'll get you an iPhone.

324
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,120
Borkar uncle, are you bribing me?

325
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,360
Borkar?

326
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
What did you just say?

327
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,000
Never talk about bribe's in this
Police Station again, understand?

328
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,200
- Hello.
- Hi.

329
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,240
I am Sangram Bhalerao,
the new station in-charge.

330
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,720
- You...
- But you can call me Simmba.

331
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,040
- Simmba.
- Correct.

332
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,520
Well, I run
the Good Food Catering Service.

333
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,520
I know... I was looking at you.

334
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,000
- What?
- I mean, I saw you. I did.

335
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,560
So then, let us worry
about your food as well.

336
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
That's good.

337
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,800
Because our sir has a good appetite.

338
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,720
That's a good thing.

339
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,680
- Don't you want to eat?
- Oh. Yes.

340
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,440
- Your name?
- Shagun.

341
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,040
- Tell me when.
- What?

342
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
I mean, you don't need permission.

343
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,160
If you have any problem,
come directly to me.

344
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,120
And anyway... I'll be
indebted to you from today.

345
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,840
- Okay. See you.
- Okay.

346
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,040
Uncle. No sweets.

347
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
- Tawde.
- Yes.

348
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,880
What is this going on?

349
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,040
'Dabbang' meets 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun'.

350
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,920
Sir, it's a 25-year-old story.

351
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,640
Shagun's father, Vishwash Sathe,
was a dashing encounter specialist.

352
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,920
He was posted in our police station.

353
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,456
Shagun's mother started a new
catering business right next to us.

354
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,120
She used to get lunch for sir every day.

355
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,280
They fell in love, then got married,
and Shagun happened.

356
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,920
But sister-in-law passed away
when Shagun was only 4-years-old.

357
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,320
Really? And Vishwas Sathe,
did he get transferred?

358
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
No, sir.

359
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,400
Sir died in a shootout three years ago.

360
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Oh! That means Shagun
and I are same.

361
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,960
- We are both orphans.
- That's great, sir.

362
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,880
- Tawde, this is mind-blowing.
- Yes sir.

363
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,240
I think history is going
to repeat itself, How, sir?

364
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,120
Shagun will someday
lose her heart to me.

365
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,440
Shagun, food and love.

366
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,120
Definitely, sir.

367
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,560
And, I am made-to-order for Shagun.

368
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,480
I am dashing like her father. Daring.

369
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,600
And a Police Officer.

370
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,840
Correct, sir.

371
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,200
And her father even laid
down his life in the line of duty.

372
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,080
- Why did you spoil my mood, Mohile?
- Calm down.

373
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Anyway.

374
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,240
- Tawde.
- Sir.

375
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,960
- Food's been arranged.
- Sir.

376
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,800
- Even found a life-partner.
- Sir.

377
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,720
- And a Police Station too.
- Sir.

378
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,760
This is nothing short of a gold mine.

379
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,840
And now all the gold will be mine.

380
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,000
Definitely, sir.

381
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,800
Do one thing. Bring me
all the files of Durva Ranade.

382
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,760
Why Durva Ranade, sir?

383
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,800
Because in the next 24 hours we're
going to shut down all his pubs,

384
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,160
illegal construction sites,
and unofficial business.

385
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,800
Durva Ranade should know
that Sangram Bhalerao has arrived

386
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,600
in Miramar Police Station.

387
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,040
Boss. The kids.

388
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,680
Hey...

389
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,840
Go directly to where I told you to go.

390
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,720
Don't stop if anyone tries to stop you.

391
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,320
And no need to worry, it's okay.
Understand.

392
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Boss.

393
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,760
Police.

394
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,880
What the...

395
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,360
Vicky, get the kids out of here.

396
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Sada, let's go.

397
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,680
Come on.

398
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
My dear brothers and their sisters.

399
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,640
You see, the clock's struck 12.

400
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,240
And before Simmba loses his temper,
make yourself scarce.

401
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,120
Sir. What a dialogue!

402
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,320
Talent, man.

403
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,240
Excuse me, sir.

404
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,560
Why did you turn off the music?

405
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,040
What seems to be the problem?

406
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
English.

407
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,080
Yeah, what did you say?

408
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,336
Why did you turn off the music?

409
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,920
Because... I didn't like your face.

410
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
Hey... Have you lost your mind,
Inspector.

411
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,920
You don't who we are.

412
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,640
This pub belongs to Durva Ranade
and we are his brothers.

413
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
So?

414
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,680
Should I look excited?

415
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,160
Don't you know its illegal
to keep the pubs open after 12?

416
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,800
Are you new around here?

417
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,400
We made a deal with
the local area in charge.

418
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,080
You will regret this, inspector.

419
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,760
Don't lock horns with us.

420
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,320
Tell me something I don't know.

421
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,480
Tell me something I don't know.

422
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,000
And yes, don't forget
to tell your brother Durva...

423
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,160
- What?
- That...

424
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,000
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Here comes... Here comes Simmba. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

425
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,520
Yes!

426
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,840
Gandhiji saved this country
using truth and honesty.

427
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,280
Gandhiji's full name as
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

428
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,280
What are you doing Nitin?

429
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,640
Gandhiji spells with 'hi'.

430
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,600
That's correct.

431
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,760
No one dared to shut down our business.

432
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,120
And that bloody cop...

433
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,800
God knows who he thinks he is.

434
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,320
You should've been there brother.

435
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,080
We should break that bloody cops legs!

436
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,280
Next time I see him around,
I will bash him.

437
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,880
- The bloody...
- Hey!

438
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,840
Don't talk like that
in front of the child.

439
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,880
I've said it a thousand times before.

440
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,440
Nitin, come here son.

441
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,920
Come to me, son.

442
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,320
Brother, he has closed
down all our other business.

443
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,880
Dutta sir said he's
sending someone useful, but...

444
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Call Dutta.

445
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,280
No need to call.

446
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,680
Sangram Bhalerao aka Simmba, reporting.

447
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,280
Look what I brought for you, Bhau.

448
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,520
Can I call you Bhau?

449
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,200
There are more than 5000
evergreen songs on this.

450
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,320
Look.

451
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,960
Hold it, Bhau.

452
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,040
Hello, brother from another mother.

453
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,840
Why so serious?

454
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Don't stress.

455
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Have a chewing gum instead.

456
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
You too.

457
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I am all out of it.

458
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,120
Nitin! Look what Simmba
uncle got for you.

459
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,680
And imported smartwatch for a smart boy.

460
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,200
Isn't it? It's mind-blowing.

461
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,960
Sister-in-law,
brand new Paitani sari for you.

462
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,000
A cup of tea, less milk, more cream.

463
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,280
Aunty, greetings.

464
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,760
I heard that you're
suffering from knee pain.

465
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,240
It goes like...

466
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,440
"There's a pain in the knee..."

467
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,760
"There's a pain in the knee..."

468
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,480
"and I have a problem getting up."

469
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,816
Aunty, this is what I got for you.

470
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,960
Latest Ayurvedic oil.

471
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,200
Massage two times a day for 11 minutes.

472
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,640
You'll walk as fast as I talk.

473
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Take it.

474
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,000
- What a lovely family, God bless them.
- Are you done with your drama?

475
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,880
This is not a charade.

476
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,016
This is a family after all,
and I am an orphan.

477
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,560
So I showed some brotherly love.

478
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,216
And closed down your brother's business.

479
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,480
No. I'll tell you why.

480
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,960
Sister-in-law, what was the
price of onions three months ago?

481
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,960
- 70 rupees.
- And what is it now?

482
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,720
- 100 rupees.
- See.

483
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,720
Inflation is touching the sky.

484
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,256
If you look at it percentage wise,
the price of onions has gone up 30%.

485
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,880
So even we deserve an
upliftment in our rate card.

486
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,216
Day-to-day expenses
are getting hard to handle.

487
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,080
I only did it to grab your attention.

488
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,240
I'll open it. I'll open everything
back again.

489
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,560
I'm your younger brother.

490
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,000
From today, you have three brothers,
and not two.

491
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,440
Sister-in-law, how many
brothers-in-law do you have now?

492
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,600
- Three.
- Three. See, Bhau.

493
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,200
You're a big rascal.

494
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,440
Bhau, tell me something I don't know.

495
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,920
Tell me something I don't know.

496
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,640
You're like a fire-cracker.

497
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,360
Someday you'll cause a big explosion.

498
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,840
Someone said this to me long ago.

499
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,640
Who?

500
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,200
I'll tell you some other day.

501
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,160
- Bhalerao.
- Yes?

502
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,840
Even you remind me of someone.

503
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,160
Really? Who?

504
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,560
Your sister-in-law's brother.

505
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,400
- Keshav.
- Really? Same to same.

506
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,920
Exactly same to same.

507
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,160
He was a good kid.

508
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,680
But... He died.

509
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,560
- How?
- I killed him.

510
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,640
You see, he tried to
double-cross me in business.

511
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
You won't do it, will you?

512
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,800
No Bhau, why will I do such a thing?

513
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,560
Look Bhalerao, I have a rule.

514
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,240
I never cross anyone's path.

515
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,720
But if someone crosses mine,
they don't live to tell.

516
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,320
You have a service revolver, don't you?

517
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,800
If someday you think
about double crossing me,

518
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,520
you can shoot yourself.

519
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Don't bother me.

520
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,600
Scared?

521
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,400
You're a mischievous kid.

522
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,760
Do one thing, drink the tea
that your sister-in-law's has prepared.

523
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,040
Go on.

524
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,720
Did he see you two
in the pub with drugs?

525
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,200
No, brother.

526
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,200
- Do we tell him?
- Not yet.

527
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,640
He's a bloody rascal.

528
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,320
We can't trust him yet.

529
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Find anything?

530
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Nothing.

531
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,920
Look, Arjun, don't lie to me.

532
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,600
Chotu saw you guys carrying
drugs in your school bags.

533
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,920
Are they paying you for doing this?

534
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,400
It's not what you think, sister.

535
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,720
Chotu is lying.

536
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,000
- Are you two doing drugs?
- No, sister.

537
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,120
Look, don't be scared.

538
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Tell me who is making you do this.

539
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,960
I don't know anything, sister.

540
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,280
Aakruti, Chotu could
be mistaken as well.

541
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,880
What's wrong, Aakruti?

542
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,400
- Nothing, father.
- Nothing.

543
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,800
Where's my dinner?

544
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,800
Dinner is ready at home.

545
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,600
You two go home and eat.

546
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,920
- But father...
- You two have completely forgotten

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,280
about your own studies
while tutoring these kids.

548
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,520
Go home and eat your dinner,
and focus on your own studies.

549
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,240
I'll tutor the kids.

550
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,360
Come on, children.
Come to me.

551
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Aakruti, I think you're overreacting.

552
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,080
Don't stress yourself.

553
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,720
Kavya, I know these kids are lying.

554
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,760
And, I think I know
who is behind all this.

555
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,160
The people behind all
this can be very dangerous.

556
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,160
I really don't think
you should get into this mess.

557
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,840
No. I won't let them ruin their lives.

558
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,840
In fact, I'll go down to the police
station tomorrow and file a complaint.

559
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,200
I am off to the check-post.

560
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,760
Excuse me, I wanted to file a complaint.

561
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,000
- Tawde.
- Yes.

562
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,400
Please assist her.

563
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,880
Come. Sit.

564
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,400
Borkar, I am hungry.

565
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,680
Go check what my Shagun
made for breakfast.

566
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Yes, sir.

567
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,640
- Tell me.
- Sir, I wanted to file a complaint.

568
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,840
Sir, my name is Aakruti Dave.

569
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,936
- I wanted to file a complaint.
- Aren't you a teacher?

570
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,080
Sir.

571
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,480
- No, sir, I am a medical student.
- Sit.

572
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
And, I practice at
the government hospital.

573
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,120
But whenever I get some spare time,
I tutor orphans too.

574
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,080
Yes, I saw you the other
day tutoring the kids.

575
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,360
Do you have a complaint?
Tell me about it. - Yes, sir.

576
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,600
Actually, some of the children that I
tutor have turned into drug carriers.

577
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,840
They smuggle drugs by putting
them into children's school bag.

578
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,600
Drugs in my area?

579
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,520
- Who is doing it?
- I've no idea, sir.

580
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,480
Sir, I think Durva Ranade's brothers
Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade are in it.

581
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,080
There are often late
night parties in their pub.

582
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,800
And I have a doubt that they
carry out their drug business there.

583
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,600
When I ask my students, they
don't tell me anything out of fear.

584
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,800
And yes, at the hospital
where I practice,

585
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,920
we often treat young
people addicted to drugs.

586
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,120
These drugs are easily
available everywhere.

587
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,280
Sir, please help me out.

588
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,840
Okay, I'll start an inquiry,
I'll look into it.

589
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,680
Okay, sir. Thank you.

590
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,480
- What is your name?
- Aakruti Dave.

591
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,680
Aakruti...

592
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,000
You remind me of my own teacher.

593
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Gayatri Devi.

594
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,640
She used to tutor me on the footpath,
just like you do.

595
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,440
She was like an older sister to me.

596
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,200
Well, I can't be your older sister sir,
but think of me as your younger sister.

597
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,320
I'll look into your matter.

598
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,560
Don't worry. Go.

599
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,680
Thank you, sir.

600
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,280
Listen, Aakruti. If you ever have
any problem in life, then call me.

601
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
Okay.

602
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,520
If I ever have any problem in life,
I will call you first.

603
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,120
Pawar.

604
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,600
Give her my number.

605
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,800
Yes, sir.

606
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,880
- Tawde.
- Sir.

607
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,120
- What is the lesson in all this?
- What, sir.

608
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,800
Durva Ranade is playing
hide-n-seek with us.

609
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,720
Yes, sir.

610
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,680
He didn't tell us
about his main business.

611
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,600
- Sir.
- Yes.

612
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,080
There's a problem at Good Food.

613
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,520
- Hit him. Hit him.
- Don't be scared.

614
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,320
Wait. Wait.

615
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,560
I said wait!

616
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,560
Stop beating him to a pulp, man.

617
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,120
Shagun. Shagun. Wait.
What are you doing?

618
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,480
I am there.
Tell me what is a problem.

619
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,040
This guy here stares at Purnima,
stalks her and troubles here.

620
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120
You bloody...

621
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,960
Hey...

622
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,480
I truly love Purnima.

623
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,480
What is he saying?

624
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,080
My love for her is so true
that I can even give my life for her.

625
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,640
Shagun...

626
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,520
You relax, I'll deal with him.

627
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,160
Uncle, your cutlery.

628
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,600
- You go, I'll deal with him.
- Move...

629
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,120
Bye, Shagun. I'll deal with him.

630
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
- So, what is your name?
- Purab, sir.

631
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,040
Why do you trouble girls?

632
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,600
You bloody...

633
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,360
Sir, I had no ill
intentions towards her, sir.

634
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,136
An intention is just another intention,
there's nothing good or bad about it.

635
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,120
Intentions don't carry a plaque
saying today I am good or bad.

636
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,240
They don't.

637
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,800
- We'll have to make a case against you.
- Sir...

638
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,640
You'll be doing time
in jail for pretty long.

639
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,280
Sir, isn't there a way to get out
of this? - Look at that.

640
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,336
You're the driver and
you're asking me for the way.

641
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,720
You bloody...

642
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,680
Even if I listen to you,
and don't file a case against you,

643
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,440
- then will you help me?
- Of course, I will, sir.

644
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Look Purab.

645
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
Not the east, look at me.

646
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,440
Actually...

647
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,160
I also love her.

648
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,016
Don't you dare set eyes on my Purnima...

649
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,720
Not Purnima, I mean my Shagun.

650
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
You bloody...

651
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,240
Her friend Shagun.

652
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,040
And only you can bring us together.

653
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,440
How is that?

654
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,640
Looking at your actions,
I can sniff the rascal inside you.

655
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,360
Come, I'll tell you what to do.

656
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,360
- Hello.
- Purab speaking.

657
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,320
Purab.

658
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,120
You must be wondering how I
got from in the cell to on the cell.

659
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,920
I broke out.

660
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,160
Do you know why?

661
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,160
Because whoever comes between
Purnima and me deserves to die.

662
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,080
And if you don't believe me,
then look outside your window.

663
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,760
Right now!

664
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,240
What happened, Shagun?

665
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,440
Aunty, that Purab's standing
outside the house and threatening me.

666
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,960
I'll deal with him.

667
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,400
Wait. Wait.

668
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,600
Don't go outside.

669
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,840
You know what, call Simmba.

670
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,200
It's ringing. It's ringing.

671
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,400
- Hello.
- Hi Simmba, Shagun here.

672
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,400
Hi Shagun, how you are?

673
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,160
Simmba, that Purab's broken out of jail
and is outside my house threatening me.

674
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,280
Purab?

675
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
Purab who?

676
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,200
That rickshaw driver?

677
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,240
Yes, that rickshaw driver.

678
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,160
Don't worry, Shagun.

679
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,720
Simmba is on the way.
I am there.

680
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,120
Ting-tong.

681
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,000
Come on.

682
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,400
- Simmba?
- Shagun, here I am.

683
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,880
You came over so quickly.

684
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,280
What! This is unbelievable.

685
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,376
If the Police come's before time,
people still complain.

686
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,120
If the Police arrives late,
people complain.

687
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,240
I don't know what to do?

688
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,480
By the way, there is no one outside.

689
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,360
He must have seen you and hidden.

690
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,800
Nice house. Very decent.

691
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,680
Shagun.

692
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,440
Purab can't be trusted.

693
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,280
Hence, I will have to stay here tonight.

694
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,640
I will sleep on the staircase.

695
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,600
- Listen.
- Tell me.

696
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,160
- You can stay inside.
- Okay.

697
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,920
- Have you eaten?
- No.

698
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,440
- I'll cook something.
- Shagun. Shagun.

699
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,160
That's all you do all day.

700
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
I'll cook dinner tonight.

701
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,200
- Wow. You make perfect round rotis.
- Obviously.

702
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,960
I have a masters degree in making rotis.

703
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,200
There was a Gurdwara
(SHRINE) back in Shivgadh.

704
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,136
And they used to distribute
free food every Sunday.

705
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,920
And cooking rotis was my duty.

706
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,080
100 rotis in one hour.

707
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
All the aunties were impressed.

708
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,120
I see. What about the girls?

709
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Weren't they impressed?

710
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,760
- I used to feel...
- What?

711
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,520
I feel shy to talk to girls.

712
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,000
I see. But you're quite brazen with me.

713
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,480
You are completely different.

714
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,120
Sir, how is it going?

715
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,080
All well.

716
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,320
Sir, I feel you won't come out before
getting married and having some kids.

717
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,040
Should I look for school admissions?

718
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
What?

719
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,880
He got scared and ran away.

720
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Exactly.

721
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,480
Even if I have to stay awake all night,

722
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,920
Shagun is absolutely
safe as long as I am here.

723
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,280
Oh... How cute!

724
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,640
Tawde, hang up.

725
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,240
So cute...

726
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,520
- Hi, Shagun.
- Hi...

727
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,320
Dhiraj, your new haircut
is looking really cute.

728
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
- You like it.
- Love it.

729
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
I just got it yesterday.

730
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,200
Simmba, this is Dhiraj.
He's my best friend.

731
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,600
And Dhiraj, this is inspector Bhalerao.

732
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,560
- Hi.
- Hello.

733
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,640
Some stalker rickshaw driver
called Purab was bothering me.

734
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,640
That's why Simmba came to help.

735
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,560
- That's really sweet.
- Okay, okay.

736
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,816
Remember our picture
on the roller coaster. - Yeah.

737
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,216
Do you know how many 'Likes' it got?

738
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,560
- 250.
- 250 Likes and you're happy.

739
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,880
She is such a coward.

740
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,880
As soon as she got on the roller
coaster, she grabbed my arm like this,

741
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,240
and closed her eyes.
I can't tell you.

742
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,960
And after we came out, she
was so scared that she wasn't eating.

743
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,600
I had to feed her with my hands.

744
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,600
And finally, she agreed.

745
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,600
My mom's always been saying that
only we can look after each other.

746
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,000
And we should get married.

747
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,120
Nonsense.

748
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,936
- It's getting late, I should go.
- You're leaving.

749
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,880
- Yeah.
- Okay.

750
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,280
- Well, see you.
- Bye.

751
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,280
Nice time.

752
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,320
Come on. Come on, it's getting late.

753
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,240
- Bye, Shagun.
- Bye, Dhiraj.

754
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,376
Will you be able to go on your own?
Or will you be scared?

755
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,480
Should I send a police team with you?

756
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,760
No, I am good. but you're a funny guy.

757
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,600
- Funny chap.
- I'm serious.

758
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,240
Don't stick your hand
out of the window, son.

759
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,480
- Dhiraj is so cute, isn't he?
- Yes.

760
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,680
Cute like little puppies.

761
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,080
Simmba.

762
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,000
- Tell me something, Shagun.
- What?

763
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,000
Is there anything
between you and Dhiraj?

764
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,920
I am thinking about it.

765
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,240
Even I am thinking about you.

766
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,640
I am thinking a lot of things.

767
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,240
Mind-blowing.

Bhalerao, meet Mr. Choksi.

He's a close friend.

810
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,400
We want an old man to vacate his land.

811
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,960
In Calangute.

812
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,480
Even I can get rid of him.

813
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,400
But, Mr. Joshi here, the lawyer,
and Cameron sir, the Corporator

814
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,600
said Bhalerao will handle the situation.

815
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,560
No, how can I handle
the situation like this?

816
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,760
I just got in Miramar recently.

817
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,400
If the word gets out,
I'll be in trouble.

818
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,960
It's a risky job, can't be done.

819
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,920
You'll get 5 million, Bhalerao.

820
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,320
Done.
Consider it done.

821
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,840
I didn't mean anything I said.

822
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,600
Bhau, this is my first time
with Mr. Choksi and Mr. Cameron.

823
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,520
We just got to know each other.

824
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,920
Anything is possible these days.

825
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,360
Secret recordings,
sting operations, etcetera.

826
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,440
That's why.
Otherwise, you know...

827
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,080
You know Bhalerao, you're a big rascal.

828
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,280
Bhau, tell me something I don't know.

829
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,160
Tell me something I don't know.

830
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,640
Mr. Waman Rao,
there's a serious problem.

831
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,440
We've received a complaint against you.

832
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,840
Durva Ranade says that he has
the original documents of this land.

833
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,920
And claims he owns this land and he's
going to sell it to Choksi.

834
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,560
He's falsely accusing me.

835
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,840
He threatened me earlier
to sell the land.

836
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,240
But I didn't agree.

837
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,520
And he's falsely accusing
me with fake documents.

838
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,720
I don't care what he did

839
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,840
but what about arrest warrant
that is in your name?

840
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,760
Why have such an emotional
attachment to the land?

841
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,240
But I've safe-kept that
land for my granddaughter.

842
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,800
Waman Rao, try to understand.

843
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Once the court proceedings begin,
then you'll be long gone,

844
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,840
and your granddaughter
will be as old as you are.

845
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,280
A court case means gone case.

846
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,320
Do you want to go to jail at this age?

847
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,440
Or keep going to hearing dates.
You don't, do you?

848
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,480
Durva Ranade is offering you 5 million.

849
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,040
5 million is not a small amount.

850
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,920
I've brought an MOU with me, sign it.
That's the best.

851
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,560
How can... I...

852
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,480
Don't lock horns with Durva Ranade,
Waman Rao.

853
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,080
He's a dangerous man.

854
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,896
You're doing this for
your granddaughter, aren't you?

855
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,416
- Yes...
- What if he abducts your granddaughter,

856
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,120
or does something unearthly.
Then what?

857
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,656
What's the point of this land,
and this property.

858
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,080
- But you're the police...
- Even the police can't help you then.

859
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

860
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,360
What happened?

861
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,280
She's been kidnapped, isn't she?

862
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,440
I told you.

863
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,240
If the heir of the property is no more,
then what's the point of this property.

864
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,160
Seal the deal, and sign the papers.

865
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,520
I've brought the MOU. Sign the papers.

866
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,640
Don't you want to
save your granddaughter?

867
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,800
I've brought the papers.

868
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,280
Seal the deal,
take your 5 million and be happy.

869
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,360
2... 3... 4... 5...

870
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,400
What? What are you staring at, Mohile?

871
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,440
You can keep 10%.

872
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,040
Enjoy.

873
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,120
You're doing the wrong thing.

874
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,360
Very wrong.

875
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,720
You took everything from that old man.

876
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,440
He couldn't control his tears,
and you are busy counting money.

877
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,040
You have no feelings.

878
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,760
Mohile, I became a
cop to make a fast buck

879
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,040
and not to help others
like some Robin Hood.

880
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,640
That old man got 5 million.

881
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,640
Do you know how much 5 million is?

882
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,360
So mind your own business,
and let me do mine.

883
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,400
Go ahead, sir. Yell louder.

884
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,360
When a person is wrong he often
yells aloud to prove himself right.

885
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,960
Mind your language, Mohile,
don't forget that I am your senior.

886
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,080
And you don't forget that
you're Inspector Sangram Bhalerao

887
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,960
who's betraying his duty
for a criminal like Durva Ranade.

888
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,080
What did you achieve with
your honesty in the last 25 years?

889
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,160
You guys just show off.

890
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,640
And if you feel really bad,
then go and shoot Durva

891
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,640
and do some good to your country.

892
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,120
Otherwise, come over to my side,
make some money

893
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,840
and do some good for your family.

894
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,600
Turn your attention from the
hooliganism around and focus on money.

895
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,680
You'll benefit more.

896
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,000
I spit on your illegal money.

897
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,600
I never wanted anything
bad for anyone yet.

898
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,960
But today I pray to God
to bring about a storm, a Tsunami

899
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,280
that sweeps you away,
and you drown in it.

900
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,200
Go ahead, pray right now.

901
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,976
You want a Tsunami,
then make it come now.

902
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,040
Start praying. I am right here.

903
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,520
Where will it come from?
From the left or the right?

904
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,280
Listen carefully, Mohile.

905
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,520
Tsunami won't come for me alone.

906
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,040
It will come for you, Durva, that old
man and his granddaughter everyone!

907
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,400
Tsunami.

908
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,160
You're accusing me like I raped someone.

909
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,040
He's spoiled my mood.

910
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,520
I am leaving the car and money behind.

911
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,960
I'll take it tomorrow.

912
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,080
And in case you need any money,
then you can take it from the bag.

913
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,920
Father.

914
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,080
Father, tomorrow is
the last date for admission.

915
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,520
If I don't pay the fee in full,
they will cancel my admission.

916
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,200
How much is it?

917
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,840
We've only paid 25,000 till now.

918
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,400
We'll need 125,000 more.

919
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,200
I don't have that kind of money, dear.

920
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,360
You know what, you should drop
out before they cancel your admission.

921
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,920
Great.

922
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,760
That's all one can expect from you.

923
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,400
Have you seen the other
Police officers in your own area?

924
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,640
Look at their lifestyle, their status.

925
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,680
Shinde, your junior.

926
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,040
His sister just finished
her computer studies.

927
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,920
And sub-inspector Rajesh bought
two pieces of land in Sawantwadi.

928
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,560
And look at you.

929
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,240
- No good to yourself, or your family.
- Come on.

930
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,040
I'll call your uncle,
he'll arrange the money.

931
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,480
Come on.

932
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,360
What?

933
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,640
I came to pick you up.

934
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,920
And, also to say sorry.

935
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,160
I went a little overboard last night.

936
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,880
But your wife's absolutely right.

937
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,696
Don't mind,
but you can still change your mind.

938
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,496
- If you need money...
- Stay out of my family...

939
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,600
Cool, cool, Mohile.

940
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,160
What?

941
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,400
Salute me, today.

942
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,800
Come on, make it a nice, crisp one.

943
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,400
Come on, just one.

944
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,600
And no excuses that
your hand's paining and all.

945
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,800
Sir, the salute is not for the man,
but the uniform he dons.

946
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,040
- What do you mean?
- You won't understand, sir.

947
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,320
Let's go.

948
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,720
Everyone wants to be Singham these days.

949
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,520
Happy Birthday!

950
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,680
Simmba, there you are.

951
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,480
Why are you so shy?

952
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,320
It's Shagun's birthday,
so why are you so dressed up.

953
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,120
What's the matter.

954
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,800
Let it be, aunty.

955
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,040
Stop it. Stop troubling him.

956
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,520
- Happy birthday, Shagun.
- Thank you.

957
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,920
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes.

958
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,720
- It's straight from the graveyard.
- What?

959
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,840
Joke. They are absolutely fresh.

960
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,280
- Excuse me.
- You are mad.

961
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,416
Shagun, come with me for a minute.

962
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,480
See you.

963
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,360
Hello, I am Suchitra.

964
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,520
- Yes. Mrs. Mohile.
- Yes.

965
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,120
And daughter Nandini.
I know.

966
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,200
I saw your mother giving
an earful to that grump...

967
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,520
- Shagun.
- Yes, coming.

968
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,560
The party's really
truly mind-blowing, Shagun.

969
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,400
The cake, gift, balloons.
Everything's fantastic.

970
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,480
Isn't it?

971
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,040
I am an orphan.

972
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,800
And so I don't know when is my birthday.

973
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,160
On Nagesh's birthday, our Patil Uncle

974
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,200
would give us two 'bhakarwadis'
free with tea.

975
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,080
Nagesh and me would eat it.

976
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,616
And that's how I celebrate my birthday.

977
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,816
Was Nagesh your school friend?

978
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,200
No. Nagesh was Uncle Patil's dog.

979
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,440
- Dog?
- Yes.

980
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,720
He was my best friend.

981
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,480
We have had a lot of parties.

982
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,160
But this party is the best.
The decoration and all... It's lovely.

983
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,040
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

984
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,240
You know, as long as my father was alive

985
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,920
my birthday parties
used to be much grander.

986
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,320
But, after he passed away,
these guys took over.

987
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,440
Now they are my family.

988
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,160
You miss your father, don't you.

989
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,240
Although we were father and daughter,

990
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,640
But he was my best friend.

991
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,040
I was only four-years-old
when mom passed away.

992
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,800
Even after her death, papa took care
of me, Good Food, and everything else.

993
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,080
Other parents sing
a lullaby to their kids.

994
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,040
But my father used to tell
me about his encounters and shootouts.

995
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,120
Wow...

996
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,320
He must have told me
over 50 encounter tales.

997
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,800
Oh, God.

998
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,440
By the way, Bhalerao.

999
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,960
If you ever want to execute an
encounter, you can take tips from me.

1000
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,280
You're dangerous.

1001
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,920
By the way,
even my father died in a shootout.

1002
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,040
But, even today this Police
Station is famous because of him.

1003
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,680
I am so proud of my papa.

1004
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,000
- Hi, Shagun.
- Dhiraj.

1005
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,520
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1006
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,720
Come on. Come inside.

1007
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,480
Simmba, how are you?

1008
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,600
Tip-top. First class.

1009
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,040
By the way, the cake has been cut,
so go help yourself.

1010
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,280
- You already cut the cake.
- Yes. Now go on.

1011
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,200
Did you have a piece
of the cake, Simmba?

1012
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,640
I did, you worry about yourself.

1013
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,120
I'll go get a piece too.

1014
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,960
- What is your problem?
- What?

1015
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,440
I've noticed that you
don't like Dhiraj particularly.

1016
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,800
Isn't it?

1017
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,400
It's not what you think.

1018
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,520
He's a good boy but has some bad habits.

1019
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,296
He gets a little touchy,
gets too close for comfort.

1020
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,800
But the rest is fine.

1021
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,960
Simmba, Dhiraj is my friend,
and there's nothing between us.

1022
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Really?

1023
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,080
Very good.

1024
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,256
By the way, what kind of a guy
are you looking for to get married?

1025
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,400
Just a general question.

1026
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,480
Me?

1027
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:27,000
- I want someone smart and dashing.
- Yes.

1028
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:32,880
And he should be at least... This tall.

1029
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,000
Like me.

1030
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,440
And he should have...
a long Maratha moustache.

1031
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,760
Like me.

1032
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,120
And if he's a Police officer, then
that would be a icing on the cake.

1033
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,280
Like me.

1034
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,400
Simmba...

1035
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,440
Do you have any friend
who is a cop and looks like that?

1036
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,560
No, I don't have any friend,
who looks like that.

1037
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,840
But let's find one. Me and... Tawde!

1038
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,280
Come on.

1039
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,680
You can say all sorts of crap,
but not the one thing that matters.

1040
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,320
Huh!

1041
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,680
Instead of twisting your words,
if you had just said 'I Love You',

1042
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,960
then we wouldn't
have wasted so much time.

1043
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,040
Right?

1044
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,400
- What do you mean?
- I mean, Bhalerao...

1045
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,600
That you and me...

1046
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,440
Mind-blowing couple!

1047
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,760
Shagun...

1048
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,680
I feel shy.

1049
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,040
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> O sweetheart. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

1089
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,200
- Hello.
- Where are you, sir?

1090
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,200
I want to meet you right now.

1091
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,840
Are you getting fits?

1092
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,720
I am coming.

1093
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,120
Mohile, I am here.
Why were you screaming...

1094
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,640
How dare you do such a thing?

1095
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,280
Who gave you a right to
interfere in our family matter?

1096
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,560
What have I done?

1097
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,000
You used your dirty money
to pay my daughter's fee.

1098
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,400
What did you think?

1099
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,360
- Why are you yelling.
- Don't interrupt.

1100
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,760
I will.

1101
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,080
- He is my son.
- Right.

1102
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,120
- He's my brother.
- Exactly.

1103
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,960
You've turned my wife
and my daughter on your side.

1104
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,440
You two have lost your mind.

1105
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,680
Nandini, you will cancel
your admission tomorrow.

1106
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,480
- Otherwise...
- Hey...

1107
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,320
Don't you dare scream
at my mother and my sister?

1108
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,520
Understand.

1109
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,360
Come on, Mohile, cool down.

1110
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,600
Come here.

1111
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,000
I paid Nandini's fee with my salary.

1112
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,320
I was saving it.

1113
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,320
Understand.

1114
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,440
Nonsense...

1115
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,680
You two go.
Don't listen to this old man.

1116
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,520
Who listens to him anyway.

1117
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,680
He is so annoying.

1118
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,200
Listen... I am in a good mood today.

1119
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,560
Let's drink.

1120
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,240
I have a bottle, in the car.

1121
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,560
I don't eat to drink anything
bought with dirty money.

1122
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,400
It's an imported brand.

1123
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,600
- You still don't want to drink?
- I do...

1124
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,920
But I'll pay for my drink.

1125
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,520
You know Mohile, scientists have
found water and ice on the moon.

1126
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,640
- So?
- So what? We just have to take liquor.

1127
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,440
Mohile, can I share something with you?

1128
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:04,120
I... love Shagun.

1129
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,520
But do you know what's even better?

1130
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,680
She loves me too.

1131
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,520
And when she confessed
this... I... I mean...

1132
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,360
It touched me.

1133
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,840
Its called... feelings, emotions.

1134
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,040
And a man like you
can never understand that.

1135
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,080
Why? Whenever I say something nice
to you, you always spoil my mood.

1136
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,080
What is your problem with me, Mohile?

1137
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,360
Sir, Shagun is like a daughter to me.

1138
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,760
If you cheat on her,
then I will shoot you.

1139
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,960
Sorry. But I won't
give you that happiness.

1140
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,840
Because I really love Shagun.

1141
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,400
True love.

1142
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,560
"Mohile. Mohile.

1143
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,920
There's no way I
can drink without you."

1144
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,160
Come on, Mohile, salute me just once.

1145
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,000
Sir, you're drunk and so am I?

1146
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,200
Sometimes you have a pain in your hand,
other times you want the uniform

1147
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,600
and now we're drunk.

1148
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,440
You know, the problem is not with me.

1149
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,280
The problem is with you.

1150
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,160
Come on. Come on.

1151
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,680
Sir...

1152
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,240
I won't let you drive today.

1153
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,480
You're drunk.

1154
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,640
This old man won't forget his
character even after he's drunk.

1155
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,480
Stop.

1156
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,920
Hey wise guy, where's your helmet.

1157
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,080
You'll have to pay fine.

1158
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,960
Come on, take me home.
I am a cop. Come on.

1159
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,480
Take me home. Take me home.

1160
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,760
Bye, bro.

1161
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,320
Look, Akriti.

1162
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,840
Stop. Stop. I said stop.

1163
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,840
Don't go anywhere.
I am a cop. Save fuel.

1164
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,560
- Akriti.
- Sir.

1165
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,600
Remember I told you that even I used
to study like this, in night school.

1166
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,960
How long have you
been teaching these kids?

1167
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,040
Its been two years now.

1168
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,320
What sir?

1169
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,680
I have a headache hearing "Sir" all day.

1170
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,600
You're my younger sister, aren't you?

1171
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,600
And I am your brother.

1172
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,560
- So call me brother.
- Okay, brother.

1173
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,200
See...

1174
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,240
Brother, can I ask you a question?

1175
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,240
Are you drunk?

1176
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,160
See... already you have
a long list of complaints.

1177
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,160
Are all sisters like this?

1178
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,256
If the brother makes a mistake,
then the sister has got to interfere.

1179
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,640
Yes, sister has to say.

1180
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,600
Okay, go. Go and tutor the kids.

1181
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,920
I am going.

1182
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,280
And remember what I said.

1183
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:06,320
If you ever have a problem in life,
think of your brother.

1184
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,040
See you. Goodbye.

1185
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,480
Kids, study properly.

1186
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,200
Don't trouble the teacher.

1187
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,960
- And whoever does, I will lock him up.
- I am the ice-cream man.

1188
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,760
- Policeman.
- I am a Policeman.

1189
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,640
You know everything, don't you?
Let's go.

1190
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,280
Bye, kids.
Bye, Akriti.

1191
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,160
Chotu, where were you?

1192
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,800
What happened?

1193
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,800
Deepak and Nitin?

1194
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,880
What about them?

1195
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,440
Drugs?

1196
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,400
In the bag.

1197
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,000
Did you see them somewhere? Where?

1198
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,360
In the pub?

1199
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,640
Come on, let's go.

1200
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,160
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Why is it so silent out here? <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

1201
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,400
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Why is it so silent out here? <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

1202
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,080
'Check if it's lying there.'

1203
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,880
'The number you are dialling is
switched off.'

1204
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,440
Hey, how did you get in here?

1205
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,560
Who are you?

1206
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,440
Come on. Come on.

1207
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,280
Sada sir.

1208
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,320
I don't know how these two got in.

1209
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,496
What is this girl doing here?

1210
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,160
She's the same girl
who tutors those kids.

1211
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,160
And filed a complaint
against us to Bhalerao.

1212
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,600
Bloody...

1213
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,280
What is your problem?

1214
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,600
My problem.

1215
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,760
You two should be ashamed.

1216
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,080
You sell drugs.

1217
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,000
Toying with the lives of children.

1218
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,080
I'll tell the Police everything.

1219
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,360
Hey!

1220
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,000
Hey!

1221
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,320
Chotu, run.

1222
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,200
Give the phone to Kavya.

1223
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,920
Catch him!

1224
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,480
You two stay here.
We'll search him over there.

1225
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,616
You think you can do anything
because I gave you a free hand.

1226
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,000
Did you lose your mind?

1227
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,760
Any news about the kid.

1228
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,120
Our boys are looking for him.

1229
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,856
If you can't find the kid,
find that Kavya.

1230
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,120
Her home, college, every detail.
Find out everything.

1231
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,080
And send our boys to her.

1232
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,320
- Hello, uncle.
- Kavya, is Akriti with you?

1233
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,160
No, why?

1234
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,200
She didn't come home last night,

1235
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,080
so I thought she might be with you.

1236
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,720
Maybe she left for the
library before you got up.

1237
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,720
Don't worry, uncle.

1238
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,920
Okay, dear.

1239
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,680
Chotu.

1240
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,240
That's the same kid.

1241
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,600
Akriti's phone.

1242
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,800
Where is Akriti?

1243
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,640
Come on, show me. Come.

1244
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,280
Boss, that kid's taking
the girl somewhere.

1245
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,360
Then follow them.

1246
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,560
And run over them.

1247
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,520
And bring that phone to me, understand.

1248
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,600
Boss, that girl went
inside Miramar Police Station.

1249
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,680
And Bhalerao is the in-charge.

1250
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:31,280
- Sir, some goons are following us.
- Umakant, take a look.

1251
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,560
- Yes, sir.
- What happened?

1252
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,640
Sir, my friend Akriti
is missing since last night.

1253
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,920
We set out to look
for her and these goons...

1254
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,600
- Akriti Dave?
- Yes.

1255
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,560
We are college friends.

1256
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,480
Sir, Chotu gave me her
Phone, which is broken.

1257
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,480
Sir, there is no one outside.

1258
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,080
- Do you know where Akriti is?
- Sir, he cannot speak.

1259
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,320
Can you take me there?

1260
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,960
Borkar, get the phone repaired.

1261
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,680
Come, Gauri madam.

1262
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,320
Bhalerao, our fates are intertwined.

1263
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,480
The one I've been looking
for land in your station.

1264
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,600
That child and girl are with you,
aren't they?

1265
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,200
Now do as I say,
take the phone from that child

1266
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,440
and bring those two to me.

1267
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,840
I am waiting for you.

1268
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,480
One more thing, don't let anyone
else get their hands on the phone.

1269
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,800
It's very important.

1270
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,000
Who was here? Akriti?

1271
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,600
Something's fishy,
something is definitely wrong.

1272
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,480
Something definitely happened
between Akriti and Sada-Giri.

1273
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,120
Why don't you ask Durva yourself?

1274
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,600
So you're going to do as you wish.

1275
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,960
I told you to get the phone.

1276
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:53,840
Why did you go to the pub?

1277
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,480
One thing is pretty clear, Bhau,
you're hiding something from me.

1278
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,320
That girl Akriti went
missing from your pub,

1279
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,576
there's definitely a connection here.

1280
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,976
And she came to me last week with
a complaint against your brother.

1281
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,840
I know what goes on in the pub.

1282
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,680
And yet I ignored it, just for you.

1283
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,080
But you hid it from me.

1284
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,520
There's nothing to hide.

1285
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,776
We got into this business because
my brothers saw some potential in it.

1286
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,880
You're not the only one
who wants to move up in life.

1287
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,080
And she made a video of
our business, what's her name...

1288
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,480
Akriti. Where is she?

1289
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,696
Maybe she got scared and ran away.
Do you see her here?

1290
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,640
Let me make one thing clear if Sada
and Giri did anything wrong with her

1291
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,560
then I will drag
those two out of here...

1292
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,480
Shut up!

1293
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,760
Not a word against my brothers.

1294
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,320
If you say another
word against my brothers,

1295
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,040
means crossing Durva Ranade's path.

1296
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,800
I've three dogs,
I feed them Pedigree (DOG FOOD).

1297
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,240
And you're the fourth one.

1298
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,720
I feed you money.

1299
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,680
If you shoot your mouth again,
I will bury you alive.

1300
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,280
Look, Bhalerao. Who is that girl?

1301
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,320
Sada and Giri are your brothers.

1302
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,240
We need you right now.

1303
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,080
I'll give you anything you want.

1304
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,400
Just bring that phone for me.

1305
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,080
And, I really don't
know where that girl is.

1306
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,200
Swear on you.

1307
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,520
You think I will lie to you.

1308
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,040
Go get the phone.

1309
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,720
Go on.

1310
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,080
Where are you going, sir?

1311
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,400
Akriti is missing, sir.

1312
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,760
It's quite clear that Durva
is trying to protect Sada and Giri.

1313
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,200
And you let him go.

1314
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,080
Come, sir.
Let's arrest these rascals.

1315
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,360
Wait, let me think.

1316
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,120
Think? Think about what, sir.

1317
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,880
- Your money.
- It's not about money.

1318
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:44,776
I am like a brother to Durva.

1319
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,800
He won't lie to me.

1320
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,680
Even Akriti considers
you as her brother.

1321
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,640
But instead of looking for her,
you're worried about your money.

1322
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,560
I've never seen such a sleazy...

1323
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,760
Alerting all Units.

1324
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,920
Alerting all Units.

1325
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:00,040
A girl has been found
in Serious condition.

1326
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,760
There's no identification.

1327
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,680
- Tawde.
- Sir, Akriti has been found.

1328
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,160
She is very serious.

1329
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,120
She is in the hospital.
Please come quickly.

1330
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,960
Sir, the victim was brutally
raped again and again.

1331
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,440
She's lost excessive blood.

1332
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,480
And even her intestines are damaged.

1333
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,680
And the damage is to such an extent that
even DNA reports cannot prove anything.

1334
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,520
I am afraid she won't survive.

1335
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,680
Akriti.

1336
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,320
Your brother's here.

1337
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,600
Child.

1338
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,000
Akriti.

1339
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,640
Child.

1340
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,840
Brother.

1341
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,720
Who did this?

1342
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,600
Tell me.

1343
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,560
Come on.

1344
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,800
What have they done with my child?

1345
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,040
She wanted to be a doctor.

1346
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,320
She always said...

1347
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,720
Once I become a doctor...

1348
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,200
I will tutor orphan children,

1349
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,280
and treat them for free.

1350
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,440
Money was never her main agenda.

1351
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,640
Never.

1352
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,360
She always cared for others.

1353
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,976
And they did such
a horrific thing to her.

1354
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
So horrific.

1355
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,880
They killed my daughter.

1356
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,240
I want to kill those bas♪♪♪

1357
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,480
Find out who they are.

1358
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,120
You're a cop, aren't you?

1359
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,440
And even she called you brother.

1360
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,840
Don't you want to kill those
bas♪♪♪ who did this to your sister?

1361
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,200
Why are you quiet?

1362
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,080
Don't you want to punish them?

1363
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,160
Don't you want to punish them?

1364
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,200
They killed my daughter.
Killed her.

1365
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,160
Sir, I just received a
call from the Police Station.

1366
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,240
Akriti's phone has been repaired.

1367
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,440
She made the last call to you, sir.

1368
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,720
Sir, Borkar was saying that there's
a video of Akriti on the phone.

1369
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,000
Bhau. Bhalerao isn't
answering his phone.

1370
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,240
Shiva, go to the Police Station
and get the phone from Bhalerao.

1371
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,960
There's your proof, sir.

1372
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,280
But you still won't arrest them,
will you?

1373
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,480
Forget it!

1374
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,440
I don't want to work with you!

1375
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,600
I've had enough
of this boot-licking.

1376
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,480
Have some shame all of you!

1377
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,640
And Tawde sir,
don't you have a sister as well.

1378
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,080
Would you have kept quiet if she
had gone through the same ordeal?

1379
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,560
I can't vouch for others, sir.

1380
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:44,880
But I will do whatever I can alone.

1381
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,040
I cannot stoop as low as you for money.

1382
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,800
'I am not as old as your sister,

1383
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,480
'but I can be your younger sister.'

1384
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,000
'If brother makes a mistake,
then sister's going to stop her.'

1385
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,920
Isn't that the phone?

Inspector Bhalerao,

1418
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:54,000
welcome to Miramar Police Station, sir.

1419
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,120
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Police! <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,040

1424
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,480
Mohile, get the Jeep and
let's go to Durva Ranade's home.

1425
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,680
His brothers Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade
raped and murdered Akriti Dave.

1426
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,520
Police have evidence against them.

1427
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,160
Now even I've lost it.

1428
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,000
Search the entire premises.

1429
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,120
Search every nook and
corner and find Sada and Giri.

1430
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,360
Don't let them escape.

1431
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,600
They must be hiding somewhere in here.

1432
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,760
Find them.

1433
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,720
- Have you lost your mind?
- Durva Yashwant Ranade.

1434
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,600
If you dare lay a finger
on an on duty police officer

1435
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,480
then I will arrest
you before your brothers.

1436
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,040
Stay in your limits, Simmba.

1437
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,360
Inspector Sangram Bhalerao.

1438
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,440
I am a senior police
officer and not your butler.

1439
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,960
Show some respect.

1440
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,120
Brother!

1441
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,640
You think you can get out of here alive
because you're wearing that uniform.

1442
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,000
- Tawde.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,040
If anyone tries to interfere,
then shoot to kill.

1444
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,120
Straight in the middle.

1445
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,560
Those are my orders, understand.

1446
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,640
Okay, sir.

1447
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,320
Don't try an intimidate me,
with your goons.

1448
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,680
When I was a kid, I shook
everyone by breaking a bottle.

1449
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,720
Remember anything.

1450
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,040
Shivgadh. Sangam Talkies.

1451
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:47,000
Yes... I am the same
kid who you told, that...

1452
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,840
Someday he'll cause a big explosion.

1453
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,080
I don't have a bottle today,

1454
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,760
but I can cause a big explosion.

1455
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,840
Back then I let you
go because you were a kid.

1456
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,400
That was my mistake.

1457
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,960
But, I won't repeat
my mistake again. - Dad.

1458
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,840
Bhalerao.

1459
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,760
Don't come between a mother and son.

1460
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,360
Aunty, do you know what Sada and Giri...

1461
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,240
Just a minute, aunty.

1462
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:38,520
When you became a mother, it must
have been a happy moment for you.

1463
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:42,040
Three sons. You gave birth to men.

1464
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,736
You must have also thought thank
God I didn't have any daughters.

1465
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,440
What's the point
in having daughters? Sons.

1466
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,800
They will make you
proud when they grow up.

1467
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,400
See, aunty,
your sons have maligned your name.

1468
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,760
Aunty, they raped a girl.

1469
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,720
And then they murdered her.

1470
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,800
She was innocent, only 19 years old.

1471
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:21,800
But don't worry, I am like your son too.

1472
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,280
I will make you proud.

1473
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:31,840
I swear I will bring them to justice.

1474
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:35,640
- Tawde.
- Sir.

1475
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,040
- Put those two in the van.
- Sir.

1476
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:37,960
Let's go.

1477
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:41,120
You should be made to run all the way
to the Police Station, you bloody.

1478
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,640
Let's go and take care of this.

1479
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,400
Durva was Bhalerao telling the truth.

1480
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,920
No, mother. He's just being greedy.

1481
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,160
He's falsely accusing Sada and Giri.

1482
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,640
You don't worry.

1483
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,600
I am here.

1484
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:29,760
Lock them up.

1485
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,800
Wait, Simmba. Just wait.

1486
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,120
We need to talk.

1487
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,520
Let go.

1488
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:43,080
That girl was making a video at our pub.

1489
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,440
We caught her.

1490
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,280
We had nothing to do with her.

1491
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,400
But later she started talking nonsense.

1492
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:52,480
She slapped me and
smashed a bottle on him.

1493
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:56,360
A petite girl like
her raised her hand on us.

1494
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,400
She hurt our ego.

1495
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,120
She hurt your ego.

1496
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:04,080
So, you rape the girl and murder her.

1497
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,640
Ego!

1498
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,000
I'll take care of your ego.

1499
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,880
She was my sister.

1500
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:19,880
She was my sister.

1501
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,040
She was my sister.

1502
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,040
She was my sister.

1503
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:25,000
She was my sister.

1504
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,800
She was my sister.

1505
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,360
- You...
- Sir, sir, sir.

1506
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,120
No, sir.

1507
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,480
No, sir. Sir... No.

1508
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,280
Leave me. Leave me.

1509
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,120
Tawde, I said leave me.

1510
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,400
Leave me.

1511
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,800
If any girl raises a hand on you,
you got to rape her.

1512
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,640
I'll take care of your ego.

1513
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,280
Jaya! Varsha! Deepti! Gauri Madam.

1514
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,320
Take care of their ego.

1515
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,280
If I don't get rid of your ego for good,

1516
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,160
then I am not a Police officer.

1517
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,560
Shove your ego up your.

1518
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,296
Show me. You want to prove
your masculinity, don't you?

1519
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,320
Show me.

1520
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,960
Let him have it. Yes.

1521
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,120
What happened to your manhood now?

1522
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,720
Come on.

1523
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,480
You're a man, aren't you?

1524
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,000
Show me, come on.

1525
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,080
Show me.

1533
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,280
Hello.

1534
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,560
- Hello, Waman Rao.
- Hello.

1535
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,040
I've heard you have a plot

1536
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,120
in the Calungute area,
and I am interested in buying.

1537
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,600
So, can we meet?

1538
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,240
There's no point.

1539
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,560
Goons have taken possession over it.

1540
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:55,160
What do you mean by taken possession?

1541
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,160
Who did it?

1542
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,840
Goons are not the point.

1543
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,160
Hooliganism is their job.

1544
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:09,360
What I really regret that
a ba♪♪♪ Police officer helped them.

1545
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,880
What did you feel, Mr. Waman Rao?

1546
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,680
Didn't you feel angry?

1547
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,816
Didn't you feel like doing
something to that Police officer?

1548
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,520
I did... I really did.

1549
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:27,080
I wanted to give him a tight slap.

1550
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,760
But I was helpless.

1551
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,120
I am old, there's nothing I could do.

1552
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:39,000
If that Police officer's father had
set him straight when he was a kid

1553
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:42,360
then, he would've never stooped so low.

1554
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,680
I am an orphan, sir.

1555
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,640
I don't have a father.

1556
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,680
I've been alone since childhood.

1557
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,880
I didn't have a mother who fed me.

1558
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:01,360
So... whenever I was hungry, I did what
I thought was right to douse my hunger.

1559
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:07,120
Actually... I never knew
what was right or wrong.

1560
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,040
I had no one to teach me right or wrong.

1561
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,760
But that doesn't mean
what I did to you was right.

1562
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:16,560
That was wrong. Completely wrong.

1563
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:17,880
And I admit it.

1564
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:20,680
You said that you wanted to hit me.

1565
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,080
So hit me. Hit me hard.

1566
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,560
Vent out your anger.

1567
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:30,280
You said that my father
would've set me straight.

1568
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,000
I never had a father.

1569
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,520
So you hit me.

1570
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,120
And then you watch...

1571
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:43,520
I will right all the wrongs.

1572

Honestly, I will change.

1574
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:51,720
I never had a father.

1575
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,760
So you hit me, I will change.

1576
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,280
Hit me. Hit me.

1584
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,680
Sir, Chotu is nowhere to be found.

1585
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,640
What do you mean not found?

1586
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,056
I've been calling
his father since morning.

1587
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,280
But his phone is switched off.

1588
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,920
And there's no one at home either.

1589
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,480
What do we do now?

1590
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,760
Sawalkar.

1591
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:13,680
- Joshi. how are you?
- Fine.

1592
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,520
You're on the front page these days.

1593
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:17,280
It's just...

1594
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,040
The prosecution has
submitted to the court

1595
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:22,520
medical reports of the
victim Akriti Dave, now deceased.

1596
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,920
And Aniket More, aka Chotu.

1597
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,480
Age 11-years, as the witness.
Please call him.

1598
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,120
Madam, he's been missing since morning.

1599
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,480
We're looking for him.

1600
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,400
Looking? Meaning?

1601
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,040
Has the witness turned hostile?

1602
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,680
What is this, Bhalerao?

1603
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,600
What are you guys doing?

1604
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,640
The witness in the...

1605
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:49,040
Sneha, wake up.

1606
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:56,680
The witness in the case Aniket More, aka
(CHOTU), age 11-years, turned hostile

1607
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,720
before the first hearing of the case.

1608
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,320
The Police report states that there's a
video recording of the assault on Akriti.

1609
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,520
Show it.

1610
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,080
This CD can't be trusted.

1611
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,840
- Do you have a pen-drive?
- Yes, madam.

1612
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,040
- Play it.
- Give it to me.

1613
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,280
Is this a joke?

1614
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,736
Didn't you check the CD
and pen-drive before submitting?

1615
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,000
There was data on it, madam.

1616
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,280
What do you mean?

1617
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,976
Did it get erased on its own?

1618
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,720
Someone's tampered
with the evidence, madam.

1619
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,080
I see... Nice.

1620
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,000
And who do you think will do it?

1621
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,400
The evidence is kept
in the Police record room.

1622
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,040
So who is going to tamper with it?

1623
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:53,160
Inspector Bhalerao, this is
a heinous crime of rape and murder.

1624
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,880
Please be serious, yeah...

1625
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,600
Joshi.

1626
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,120
According to the
post-mortem reports,

1627
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,560
the rape was committed
on the night of 22nd September.

1628
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,880
But Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade were
not in the pub on that night, madam.

1629
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:13,280
Both the brother was with Corporator
David Cameron at their farmhouse.

1630
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:18,200
As a witness, can I call
the Corporator to the witness box?

1631
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,440
Thank you.

1632
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:23,760
On the night of 22nd September, these
two were with me at my farmhouse.

1633
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,200
We met after a long time.

1634
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:27,880
We talked till wee hours in the night.

1635
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,800
In fact, I dropped them home.

1636
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,320
Thank you.

1637
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,680
That's a lie, madam.

1638
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,120
On the night of 22nd,
they were in their club Divine

1639
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:37,920
where they host rave parties.

1640
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,800
And during the day they
indulge in drug smuggling

1641
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,800
by stowing them away
in children's school bags.

1642
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,720
That night, when Akriti arrived at the
club with Chotu, she saw everything.

1643
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:51,120
And when they saw Akriti recording
everything on her phone

1644
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,400
then they got into a quarrel.

1645
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:56,120
When Akriti threatened them
to go to the Police

1646
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,600
then these two lost their temper

1647
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:00,360
and in a fit of rage, they raped her.

1648
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,200
They raped her in a fit of rage, madam.

1649
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,680
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1650
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:09,760
The Police found no traces of drugs

1651
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,640
and there is no evidence
supporting the fact

1652
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,720
that the rape was conducted
on Divine's premises.

1653
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,920
Here's the Police Report.

1654
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,200
On what grounds are you arguing with me?

1655
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:21,640
Madam, my client is being
falsely accused as an easy target.

1656
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,760
That's all.

1657
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,840
Madam, they admitted to
the Police of raping Akriti Dave.

1658
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,080
Hello Inspector Sangram Bhalerao.

1659
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,840
For your kind information.

1660
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:36,360
Any statement given to the Police
is not admissible in the court.

1661
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,240
Madam, I know he's not
too serious towards his job.

1662
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:43,520
I know. But you should at least know

1663
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,560
that the court needs evidence.

1664
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,080
Madam, I would like to request
the court to give us another date.

1665
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,160
We'll get new evidence, madam.

1666
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,336
On what basis are you asking
for another hearing date?

1667
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:57,160
You have no CCTV footage, nor witness.

1668
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,440
Nor any proof.

1669
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,560
Then on what basis is Sangram
Bhalerao accusing my client.

1670
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,880
I will tell you why?

1671
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,280
It's nothing.

1672
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:08,560
He's just venting his
personal frustration, madam.

1673
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,680
Nothing more.

1674
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:11,616
On the first day of his
duty in Miramar Police station

1675
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:15,320
he went straight to Sadashiv
and Gaurav Ranade's pub.

1676
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:18,360
Even though that pub isn't
under his jurisdiction, madam.

1677
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,920
Extortion, madam. Extortion.

1678
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:24,520
When Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade refused

1679
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,080
to pay protection money
to Sangram Bhalerao

1680
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,000
then this man here couldn't digest it.

1681
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:33,280
And when Akriti Dave was raped,

1682
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,320
then Inspector Sangram Bhalerao

1683
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,920
falsely accused my client
of rape and murder, madam.

1684
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,800
Why? Just for revenge.

1685
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,520
Madam, I would request the
court to suspend such officers.

1686
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:55,040
I wish, madam, that instead
of falsely accusing my clients,

1687
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,200
Sangram Bhalerao had used his
efforts in finding the real rapists

1688
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:01,720
then he wouldn't be
wasting the court's time.

1689
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:02,960
That's all.

1690
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,080
Wait a minute, madam.

1691
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:17,120
I have something to say.

1692
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,640
I am sure you remember
Delhi's Nirbhaya case.

1693
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:22,800
You all do.

1694
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:27,200
That rape was committed
on 16th December 2012.

1695
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,600
2012

1696
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,560
The entire country had united.

1697
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:33,480
Everyone raised their voice for justice.

1698
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,000
But what happened after that?

1699
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,280
The very next year, in 2013,

1700
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:44,240
there was 33,707 rapes in our country.

1701
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:47,560
In 2014, 36,735 rapes.

1702
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:50,440
In '15, 34,651 rapes.

1703
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,520
In 2016, 38, 937 rapes.

1704
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,560
And the records of 2017

1705
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,520
and 2018 is yet to come.

1706
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:10,840
More than 180,000 rapes in
our country in the last 5 years.

1707
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,920
I am not making it up, madam.
National Crime Bureau.

1708
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:15,496
The entire information is available,

1709
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,560
you can all take a look.
You too, Mr. Joshi.

1710
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:22,360
Madam, there are many other cases

1711
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,240
which don't get registered
out of fear, or embarrassment.

1712
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:34,480
Last year... an 8-month-old
child was raped.

1713
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,840
8-month-old.

1714
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,760
When Nirbhaya incident happened,
the country was awoken.

1715
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:48,280
But these bloody rapists are monsters.

1716
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,600
Their conscience will never awaken.

1717
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,200
They have no fear, madam.

1718
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,920
They think what's the
most that will happen.

1719
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,040
We'll go to court.

1720
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:57,416
Then, from session
court to higher court.

1721
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,696
From higher court to supreme court.

1722
01:47:58,720 --> 01:47:59,640
And, even if they get sentenced

1723
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:00,736
they will be out on parole.

1724
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:03,680
But every time they get free, it
will only encourage them further.

1725
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,920
Then there's no saying

1726
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:09,760
some 16-year-old girl studying in
National College can be raped too

1727
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,680
whose name maybe Sandhya.

1728
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,376
Isn't your daughter's name Sandhya?

1729
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:18,240
Bhalerao! How dare you?

1730
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:21,400
How dare you bring up my daughter?

1731
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,920
I am sorry, madam. I am sorry.

1732
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,680
That's not what I meant.

1733
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,240
You're a judge, with power.

1734
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,360
And yet you lost your temper
hearing your daughter's name.

1735
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:38,560
Imagine that helpless father's plight.

1736
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,120
How does he feel?

1737
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,520
He's got the same
rage inside him, madam.

1738
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,080
But unfortunately, he's not powerful.

1739
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:57,640
But he believes that you
have the power to give him justice.

1740
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:01,680
Just one more hearing, madam.

1741
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:09,880
It's the least a daughter
of this country can do for another.

1742
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:24,320
Madam. He's confusing
the court with his lectures.

1743
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:27,560
His demand for an extension
is completely baseless.

1744
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,840
Today is Friday when
the court opens on Monday...

1745
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,080
Madam, you cannot...

1746
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:47,720
Joshi. Please don't
teach me my job.

1747
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:48,960
Understand.

1748
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:53,320
The court will announce
its judgement on Monday morning.

1749
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:56,800
The Police has two days.

1750
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:02,800
Until then Sadashiv Ranade and Gaurav
Ranade will stay in Police custody.

1751
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:24,240
Who is the in-charge here?

1752
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,320
Are you the in-charge here?

1753
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:30,640
Yes, sir.

1754
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:33,000
How did the evidence in
Akriti Dave case get erased?

1755
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:34,520
I don't know, sir.

1756
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,240
- You're lying.
- Not at all.

1757
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:39,240
- How much did Durva Ranade pay you?
- Not at all, sir.

1758
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,000
Shame on you.

1759
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,800
Does he remind you of anyone, Mohile?

1760
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,600
There was a time when I was like this.

1761
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:58,880
Now I understand why
you were so angry with me?

1762
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:01,080
What's the point in hitting him?

1763
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:02,920
You should be hitting me instead.

1764
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,680
A few men arrived in a car, sir.

1765
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,880
They gave Chotu's father some money.

1766
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,080
And he left in an hour.

1767
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,080
He was a bloody drunkard.

1768
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,361
No trace of the other children
who used to go to the club.

1769
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,880
Sir. We checked at the pub.

1770
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,760
There was no CCTV camera there.

1771
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:24,600
I told you...

1772
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,600
It's been three months.

1773
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:27,960
No, sir. We are working on it.

1774
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:31,520
Inspector, just a minute.

1775
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,520
Take your shoes off first.

1776
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,280
If the floor gets dirty,
my wife will get angry.

1777
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:44,360
You testified in the court
that Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade

1778
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,976
were at your farmhouse
on the night of 22nd September.

1779
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:46,640
Yes.

1780
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,776
We want to check the CCTV
footage of your farmhouse.

1781
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,440
CCTV?

1782
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,680
Inspector,
who installs CCTV in the farmhouse.

1783
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:56,120
The farmhouse is to relax, you know.

1784
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:01,800
But your servant said that just two days
ago you took down all the CCTV cameras.

1785
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,600
Don't listen to him.

1786
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:04,720
He's stupid.

1787
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,520
I am sure he doesn't even
know what CCTV stands for.

1788
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:09,880
To be very honest with you,
I don't know either.

1789
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:14,600
Is he stupid or are
you being extra-smart, sir?

1790
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:17,120
Bhalerao,
I'll come straight to the point.

1791
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,160
I've known them since their childhood.

1792
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,760
They are not bad kids.

1793
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,440
It's just their hormones.

1794
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:24,800
It's very natural.

1795
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,280
Durva is completely prepared.

1796
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,360
You know. You work for him as well.

1797
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:35,120
Durva is prepared to give 4-5
million rupees to the girl's father.

1798
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:39,960
Even the girl couldn't have earned
that kind of money if she was alive.

1799
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,640
It's a good thing for the father.

1800
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,800
Stay...

1801
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,240
Stay...

1802
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,160
He's getting what he deserves.

1803
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,640
Stay back.

1804
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:01,320
Hit him.

1805
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,040
Maria. Maria.

1806
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:04,720
Coming, darling, coming.

1807
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:06,480
- Darling...
- Why are you hitting him?

1808
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:07,920
Make a video. Make a video.

1809
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,160
- Okay, okay.
- Make a video.

1810
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:12,200
Shoot it. Shoot it.

1811
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,120
Come on, Maria.

1812
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,680
Shoot it. Maria Shoot it.

1813
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:18,480
Hit him.

1814
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,760
In today's top 10 news.

1815
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,600
Inspector Sangram Bhalerao

1816
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:24,000
forcefully barged in Corporator
David Cameron's house

1817
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:27,240
who is the prime witness in
Akriti Dave Case, and thrashed him.

1818
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,520
The video's gone viral.

1819
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,296
The Ministry has expressed their anger

1820
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,760
over the misconduct
by Inspector Sangram Bhalerao.

1821
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:34,200
Only the time will tell

1822
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,760
whether any action will
be taken against him or not.

1823
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:40,480
The Police department has
no answers to our questions.

1824
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:43,000
Can this is carelessness
on the Police's behalf.

1825
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:44,400
Or their hooliganism?

1826
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,160
You're suspending me, sir.

1827
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,800
You know that Corporator is lying.

1828
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,440
Is not about the truth or lies.

1829
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:59,000
You clobbered him with a
shoe and sent him to the hospital.

1830
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,240
He's an important part of our party.

1831
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:02,880
The party's pressurizing me.

1832
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,800
I will have to suspend you.

1833
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,200
Even I have to answer to my superiors.

1834
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:12,000
How much money did Durva give you, sir?

1835
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:16,320
Bhalerao.

1836
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:18,920
Slow down.

1837
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,160
You've already made many enemies.

1838
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,080
You don't need one more.

1839
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:33,280
Look. I understand...

1840
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,000
You should too.

1841
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,480
Things have really heated up.

1842
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,120
As soon as everything cools down,

1843
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,280
I will appoint you on a better post.

1844
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,640
And Sadashiv and Gaurav.

1845
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:46,560
They will be released tomorrow.

1846
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,680
It's no longer about post or money.

1847
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,080
It's about Akriti.

1848
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:02,800
Suspend you.

1849
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,800
How can they just suspend you?

1850
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:14,800
Brother, you will leave tomorrow.

1851
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:19,840
And even they will be released tomorrow.

1852
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,040
My father is the head-constable.

1853
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:31,880
And my brother, Sangram Bhalerao,
is a three-star officer.

1854
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,560
But... I am still scared.

1855
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:41,480
Whenever I hear such things.

1856
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:48,440
I am scared to go
anywhere alone at night.

1857
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:53,280
Akruti was a topper of her class.

1858
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:55,960
She wanted to be a doctor.

1859
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,960
And these people shattered
her dreams in a single day.

1860
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:14,280
Brother, the daughters of
this country are getting educated.

1861
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:20,280
But who will save
them from these monsters?

1862
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,160
Uncle.

1863
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:46,120
Can I get a cup of tea, dear?

1864
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:47,880
Yes.

1865
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,400
Tea.

1866
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,760
I just returned from Nasik,

1867
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,160
after performing Akruti's final rites.

1868
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:05,160
It's said that when you disperse
the ashes, the soul rests in peace.

1869
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:10,120
I know...

1870
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:14,960
she is sad.

1871
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:19,920
Her soul is not in peace.

1872
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:27,160
And she won't rest in peace
until she doesn't get justice.

1873
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,720
You couldn't do anything right.
Bhalerao.

1874
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:41,000
They will be released tomorrow,
won't they?

1875
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:48,680
Do one thing.

1876
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,320
Give me this gun.

1877
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:51,520
I will kill them.

1878
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:52,736
- What are you doing, uncle?
- No, uncle.

1879
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:55,216
Just say that the old man went
crazy mourning for his daughter.

1880
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:57,480
- Let go,
- Please give it.

1881
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,640
I beg you, please shoot me instead.

1882
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,640
Take pity on me. Please.

1883
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,400
Uncle. Uncle...

1884
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:06,960
We understand your pain.

1885
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,560
But we cannot shoot
someone in a fit of rage.

1886
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,040
We're still inquiring.

1887
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,360
Come with me.

1888
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,840
Dear, send the tea over.

1889
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:14,960
Borkar.

1890
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:16,680
Come with me.

1891
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:18,480
Come on. Easy.

1892
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,960
What a day, isn't it?

1893
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,880
I am sure he never harmed
a single soul in his life.

1894
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:41,560
But he's willing to commit murder
for the sake of his daughter.

1895
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,360
Sir, there must be many
other fathers in our country

1896
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,600
who will only shed tears
for the rest of their lives.

1897
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,480
Sometimes these things
really make me angry.

1898
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:55,360
Honestly speaking,

1899
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:00,160
sir, until the cops don't
start eliminating these rapists

1900
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,840
nothing around here will change, sir.

1901
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:19,560
I have a question, Shagun.

1902
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:22,136
What would your father
have done in situation like this?

1903
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:24,360
After what they did to Akruti

1904
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,760
father would've shot them.

1905
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,880
Direct encounter.

1906
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,120
Direct!

1907
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:37,880
And you ladies...

1908
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:40,680
When you hear about rapes,
what comes to your mind?

1909
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,520
Purnima. - That those rapists
deserve to die.

1910
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,920
You mean once and for all.

1911
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:55,880
- What do you think, Supriya?
- They don't deserve to live.

1912
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:57,080
Just kill them.

1913
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:00,720
And you?

1914
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,000
Hack them publicly.

1915
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:07,240
What do you think, Nandini?

1916
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:11,040
Don't be scared.

1917
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,120
Your brother is right here.

1918
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:16,056
Forget about the court
and Durva and everything else.

1919
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,080
Just tell me what you think?

1920
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:23,320
They should be killed, brother.

1921
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:39,280
Bhalerao, what are you going to do?

1922
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,800
Your father made
this Police Station famous

1923
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:43,800
with more than 50 encounters.

1924
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:52,240
Now before I leave, I'll make
this a historic Police Station.

1925
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:59,480
You've heard many encounter
stories, haven't you?

1926
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,040
Now you get to see one.

1927
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:08,440
Tawde, nothing will change until
we don't eliminate them, isn't it?

1928
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,440
Come on, let's show them.

1929
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:20,080
Come on, gang, prepare the tiffins.

1930
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,600
Its time for Sada
and Giri's last supper.

1931
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:26,080
You're a policeman's daughter.

1932
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,040
Don't be scared.

1933
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:32,800
Protect the good, and eliminate the bad.

1934
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:39,160
Protect the good, and eliminate the bad.

1935
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:45,520
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Simmba... <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

1936
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:48,640

1939
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:42,600
Sir...

1940
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,000
CCTV.

1941
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:52,440
Come on, then let's make
a superhit film on the CCTV.

1942
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:22,880
Come, aunty. Come in, everyone.

1943
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,120
Brought my dinner. Very good.

1944
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:49,360
- Tawde.
- Yes, sir.

1945
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,160
- Come, sit, let's eat.
- Yes, sir.

1946
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,320
- Tawde,
- Yes, sir.

1947
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:02,520
I don't think they committed
the rape. - Why, sir?

1948
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:05,120
Look at them.
They look like they are impotent.

1949
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:07,800
Look at Giri.

1950
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,520
He's highly addicted to drugs.

1951
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,960
Bloody junkie.

1952
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:13,080
I don't think his thing works.

1953
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:18,800
And that Sada.

1954
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,120
Arrested on murder charges.

1955
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:23,080
Fresh out of the shell
and already in jail.

1956
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,496
Sir, I've got some delicious
egg-curry, Do you want some?

1957
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:27,000
Of course. Of course.

1958
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:30,360
You need guts to kill someone.

1959
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:34,080
These bloody leaches
are taking free credit.

1960
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:37,400
- Bhalerao.
- Calm down.

1961
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,080
- Gauri madam.
- Yes, sir.

1962
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:44,120
- I think Durva's lawyer is stupid.
- Why, sir?

1963
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:46,360
If he had sent these boys for a test,

1964
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:47,736
then we wouldn't have gone to court.

1965
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,720
They would've been let off
with a certificate of impotence.

1966
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,520
You're absolutely right, sir.

1967
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:54,240
They look like they are impotent.

1968
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:58,800
Who are you calling impotent?

1969
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:03,360
Bhalerao, do you want
to know how I raped that girl?

1970
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:04,440
Huh...

1971
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:07,200
First, we had our fun with her.

1972
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:11,120
Then we made her suffer to death.

1973
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:19,440
I don't know how she was still alive.

1974
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:23,120
If you don't believe me,

1975
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:26,040
then we can give you
a demonstration on that girl.

1976
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:33,120
She's like a sister to you, isn't she?

1977
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:34,560
Send her inside.

1978
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:36,280
And we'll show you if we're men or not.

1979
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:37,560
Send her in.

1980
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,920
What kind of a father are you?

1981
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:54,520
He's talking nonsense about your
daughter and how can you listen.

1982
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:58,720
Anyone else in your place would've
gone straight inside the lock-up.

1983
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:04,840
Give me the keys, Borkar.

1984
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:09,880
Give me the keys, Borkar.

1985
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:14,080
Give me the keys, Borkar!

1986
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,920
How dare you say such
things about my daughter?

1987
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,400
Hold on.

1988
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:25,640
How dare you say such
things about my daughter?

1989
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:27,960
Come on.

1990
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:35,280
You want to fight with me.

1991
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:39,040
Come on.

1992
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:42,560
How dare you say such
things about my daughter?

1993
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:47,880
Leave me.

1994
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:51,200
How dare you say such
things about my daughter?

1995
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:58,200
Umakant, Tawde, listen to me carefully.

1996
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,880
Unclip your holsters and move ahead.

1997
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,400
Take your guns out
and give it in their hand.

1998
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:11,120
- Borkar, cover us.
- Let's go.

1999
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:16,040
- Leave him.
- Leave him.

2000
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:17,560
How dare he hit you, Mohile sir.

2001
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:18,800
How dare you?

2002
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:20,600
Leave me.

2003
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,080
Leave me.

2004
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:47,160
Sir!

2005
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:55,960
There you go, uncle.

2006
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:58,440
Justice has been served.

2007
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,120
- Tawde.
- Sir.

2008
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,800
Get the CCTV footage and call IG sir.

2009
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:16,880
Tell him Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade
were killed in an encounter

2010
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:18,240
at Miramar Police Station.

2011
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,800
So you had to kill them
in self-defence. - Yes, sir.

2012
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:39,120
Sangram, I've been
in service for 30 years.

2013
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:40,816
Do you take me for a fool?

2014
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:42,080
We've proof, sir.

2015
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:43,480
CCTV footage.

2016
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,760
- Increase security at the hospital.
- Yes, sir.

2017
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:50,120
Durva Ranade won't stay quiet.

2018
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,560
Bankar.

2019
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,040
What... will we tell mother?

2020
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:31,240
Durva, Inspector Bhalerao
had to shoot them in self-defence.

2021
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,520
We've proof and witnesses.

2022
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,080
Do you think I am crazy, IG?

2023
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:38,000
He killed my brothers.

2024
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:39,480
Murdered them.

2025
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,200
Where is that Bhalerao?

2026
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,280
Stop him.

2027
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:49,080
Bhalerao!

2028
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,080
Catch him.

2029
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:52,160
You killed my brothers.

2030
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:53,680
How dare you!

2031
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:56,240
You are a mere police officer.

2032
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,000
Hold him.

2033
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:15,080
You're a dog.

2034
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:16,360
You will die too.

2035
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:17,680
I will kill you.

2036
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:19,520
You're a dog.

2037
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:21,080
You lived off our money.

2038
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:23,000
And now you did this.

2039
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:24,520
You're an orphan, aren't you?

2040
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:26,360
You don't know what a family is.

2041
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:28,240
You don't know what a father means.

2042
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:30,200
You don't know what a mother means.

2043
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:32,160
A brother or a sister.

2044
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:33,600
You're a bloody insect.

2045
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:34,840
Wrong!

2046
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,720
Wrong again, Durva.

2047
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:38,960
I have a family.

2048
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:40,520
A complete family.

2049
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,040
I have a father.

2050
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,880
A mother.

2051
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:52,720
I have a sister as well.

2052
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:56,800
Yes! I don't have a brother.

2053
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:59,080
But, now nor do you.

2054
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:01,480
Bhalerao!

2055
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:04,840
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Here comes Simmba. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

2056
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:11,120
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Here comes Simmba. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

2057
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,080
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Take him down. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

2058
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:18,080
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Police! Take him down. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

2059
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:20,120
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Police! <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

2060
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:22,120
- Calm down!
- I will kill him.

2061
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,840
I will kill him.

2062
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:24,840
What are you doing?

2063
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:27,600
The Police, public,
and media are all out there.

2064
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,800
- I'll see him in court...
- No.

2065
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:32,320
No more courts. No more case.

2066
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:34,240
- I want to kill that rascal...
- Calm down.

2067
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,760
Calm down, Bhau Sit down.

2068
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:37,760
Please calm down.

2069
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:41,440
Right now just take care of your mother.

2070
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:46,280
Please.

2071
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:56,040
Papa.

2072
02:12:56,720 --> 02:13:00,560
Even you know what brother
Simmba did was right.

2073
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,960
But now you must do what I say.

2074
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,080
Please stop brother Simmba's suspension.

2075
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:15,280
What if it was me instead of Akruti?

2076
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:26,680
This CCTV footage is staged.

2077
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:27,880
It's just drama.

2078
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:29,600
I am completely sure that

2079
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:32,960
my clients Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade

2080
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:34,800
weren't killed in self defence.

2081
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:40,160
They were cunningly drawn
out of their cell and murdered.

2082
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,520
For the further investigation
of this case,

2083
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:45,600
I would request the panel

2084
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:48,400
for an SIT Committee.

2085
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:51,480
These allegations are baseless,
madam. You saw it yourself...

2086
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:54,000
There were nine witnesses present there.

2087
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:55,760
And they have given their statements.

2088
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,040
So why this inquiry now?

2089
02:13:57,200 --> 02:14:00,200
Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade
were accused rapists,

2090
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:02,160
Mr. Sawalkar, but not proven.

2091
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:05,400
They were to be released
from jail the next day.

2092
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:09,400
And ma'am,
while they were in Police demand

2093
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:12,040
why would they misbehave with any girl?

2094
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:15,160
Why will they snatch the
guns from the Police officers

2095
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:17,640
and attack Inspector Sangram Bhalerao.

2096
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:20,120
And most importantly...

2097
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:24,280
The footage we saw, only had video

2098
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:25,920
there was no audio.

2099
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:27,560
Think about it.

2100
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:31,400
- Fine.
- But, madam.

2101
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:32,600
Sawalkar.

2102
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,280
Your witnesses are telling
the truth correct?

2103
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:37,440
- Yes, madam.
- Then what is the problem?

2104
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:42,320
We'll appoint an SIT
Committee for further inquiry.

2105
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:44,400
Ma'am.

2106
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,160
This murder was committed inside
the Police Station very cunningly.

2107
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:52,600
The inquiry can be doctored.

2108
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:57,640
This inquiry has to
be fair and impartial.

2109
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:00,960
Madam, I will solve
Mr. Joshi's problem.

2110
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:05,600
The state will appoint a neutral
officer for this special inquiry.

2111
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:07,320
Okay.

2112
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:34,640
Bhau, we still have
a card left up our sleeve,

2113
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:37,000
The SIT Committee. Don't stress.

2114
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:40,560
Once the SIT Committee
officer has done his investigation,

2115
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:42,240
and Simmba loses his job,

2116
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:43,600
later you can...

2117
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:46,560
I am done with the court and Law.

2118
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,600
No more SIT.

2119
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:50,600
He killed my brothers, Joshi.

2120
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:53,960
Now Durva Ranade will
do what needs to be done.

2121
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:48,720
You must be wondering
what's happening to you.

2122
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:50,600
You guys are the cops.

2123
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:52,480
You make reports.

2124
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:55,800
Tomorrow morning there
will be a report on you.

2125
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:58,480
That will say that Bhalerao
was travelling in his car

2126
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:00,680
which was rammed
off the road by a truck.

2127
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:02,280
The car plunged into the water.

2128
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:03,920
And Bhalerao drowned to death.

2129
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,760
You shot my brothers in an Encounter.

2130
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,480
You killed them.

2131
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:14,280
You killed them.

2132
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:24,720
No! I didn't kill them.
I didn't kill them.

2133
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:28,920
I exterminated them!

2134
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:31,560
I exterminated your brothers!

2135

2163
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:14,160
Bhalerao,
I'm here to investigate your case.

2164
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:17,880
And I will soon find out the truth.

2165
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,600
I know all about you.

2166
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,040
You know what, sir.

2167
02:22:24,320 --> 02:22:28,160
Whenever anyone watches the news
or reads a story on rape

2168
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:30,320
whether young or old, male-female.

2169
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:36,040
Every Indian has only one opinion.

2170
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:39,720
These rapists should be shot dead.

2171
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:43,840
It's such a horrific crime, sir.

2172
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:45,800
Takes only a few minutes to commit.

2173
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:49,880
But it takes a life time to get
justice against this crime.

2174
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:53,160
Do you think that your method was right?

2175
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:56,760
That wasn't my method, sir.

2176
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:00,040
It was Bajirao Singham's method.

2177
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:16,800
This is my team's
complete and final report.

2178
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:21,440
Office Sangram Bhalerao did not murder
Sadashiv Ranade and Gaurav Ranade.

2179
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:23,640
He only shot them in self-defence.

2180
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:26,720
And that's not all.

2181
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:31,400
We can also prove that Sadashiv and
Gaurav Ranade raped Akriti Dave.

2182
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:35,000
I want to call Durva
Ranade's wife and mother.

2183
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:38,160
Please.

2184
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:06,720
That Akriti was raped by my husband's
brothers Sadashiv and Gaurav.

2185
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:10,800
And yes, they also ran
a drug business in that club.

2186
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Varsha!

2187
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:15,960
Do you know what you're saying!

2188
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:17,080
Enough!

2189
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:20,120
What's wrong is wrong.

2190
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:23,040
A girl's been raped, Durva.

2191
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:27,680
Madam whether Bhalerao killed them
or was compelled to kill them

2192
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:29,720
that's up to you to decide.

2193
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:34,120
But my sons committed the rape.

2194
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:38,440
Mr. Joshi,
would you like to question them?

2195
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:40,000
- Yes, madam.
- No, Joshi.

2196
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:44,960
You won't question mum!

2197
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:50,200
Mum is telling the truth, madam.

2198
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:51,760
Wow, Durva.

2199
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,080
You really respect your mother a lot.

2200
02:24:56,840 --> 02:25:00,600
But you didn't teach your brothers
to respect other women.

2201
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:07,200
Mrs. Bharti Ranade,
you deserve an applaud.

2202
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:08,960
But I regret.

2203
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:10,896
If only you had taken this step earlier,

2204
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:13,600
then a girl would've never
gone through such an ordeal.

2205
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:17,160
I have a question, Mrs. Bharti.

2206
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:20,880
What if you had three daughters,
instead of three sons?

2207
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:24,720
Would you have still given them the
same liberty to do as they please?

2208
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:29,400
Mrs. Bharti, you gave them the
liberty because they were your sons.

2209
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:36,120
Pardon me,
you're as guilty as your sons are.

2210
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:44,840
As well as all those parents who don't
teach their sons to respect women.

2211
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:50,120
Mr. Joshi, you can appeal
in the higher court if you wish.

2212
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:55,480
But this court is of the judgement that
Sadashiv Ranade and Gaurav Ranade

2213
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:58,880
raped and murdered Akriti Dave.

2214
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:08,880
And Bajirao Singham's report
from the SIT Committed proves

2215
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:12,040
the Sangram Bhalerao
fired in self-defence.

2216
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:21,240
And under section 186 IPC,

2217
02:26:21,320 --> 02:26:25,280
assaulting an on-duty Police
officer, section 307 IPC,

2218
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:26,920
attempt of murder

2219
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:29,640
section 22 of NDPS Act,

2220
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:33,800
the court sentences Durva Ranade
to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment.

2221
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:37,360
And the written judgement
would be followed.

2222
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:58,520
Bloody Bhalerao, you are very talented.

2223
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:02,560
You make any family your own.

2224
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:09,000
You made my mother and my wife,
testify against me in court.

2225
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:11,800
You really have an art.

2226
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,120
What to do, Durva?

2227
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:17,320
I was an orphan when I was a kid.

2228
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:20,440
And now he's showering me with family.

2229
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:25,240
I will be back... Soon!

2230
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,440
You'll find me standing right here.

2231
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,760
WhatsApp me when you get out.

2232
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:43,120
Thank you, sir, for handling everything.

2233
02:27:45,360 --> 02:27:46,560
If it wasn't for you, then...

2234
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:49,840
These monsters need
to feel the fear, Bhalerao.

2235
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:53,360
Right now this fear exists
only in the hearts of the parents

2236
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:55,880
whose daughters come home late at night.

2237
02:27:57,480 --> 02:27:59,920
Even if she's returning
from a party with her friends,

2238
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:04,440
or from her job, or moved to
a different city to make a career.

2239
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:10,200
I only helped you because
I wanted to instil this fear

2240
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:12,760
in those monsters

2241
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:15,920
who don't hesitate to
commit horrible crimes like rape.

2242
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:21,480
Whenever they will have
ill-intentions for a woman

2243
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:25,200
they must have this fear in their mind.

2244
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:31,280
That a few insane cops
will come and shoot them dead.

2245
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:34,880
No arrest. No long court cases.

2246
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:36,840

2259

So you managed to save Bhalerao
after all, Bajirao.

2260
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:24,280
He was leading a life of lies.

2261

But truth finally caught up with him.

2262
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,560
Truth is like the sun.

2263
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:31,720
It might stay hidden for a while

2264
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,400
but will come forth eventually.

2265
