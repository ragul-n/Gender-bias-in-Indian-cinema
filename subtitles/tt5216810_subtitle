Sir our product
Immune Boost Plus is in liquid form.

2
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,612
And it's purely
an Ayurvedic product.

3
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,838
Hello.
- You just need to have it to..

4
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:59,743
Sir, this is Yogesh
from Naaru Infotech.

5
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,205
Can I talk to you for 2 minutes?

6
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,802
I Mean you need to avoid.

7
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,244
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

8
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:07,307
Sir, we have got
special skin products.

9
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:09,278
...which will be very
beneficial for your skin.

10
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,812
Sir, even you couldn't recognize..

11
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,744
...Mr. Anupam Kher's talent
in the beginning.

12
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,239
Sir, you might remember,
that when he was..

13
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,870
...leaving Bollywood & returning
to his village..

14
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:19,106
...you had called him
back from the station.

15
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,036
And that's how Film
'Saaransh' was born.

16
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:27,008
Sir, even I am looking
for such an opportunity.

17
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,010
Sir, please sir.

18
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,842
You will have to sing.
Hello. Hello. How are you?

19
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,779
Mr. Sharma. How are you?
- What wonderful clothes.

20
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,676
If you hadn't come...

21
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,713
I did tell him..
Son-in-law, please sit.

22
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:00,041
Hi.

23
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,679
Hello. - We are so happy
that you have come here.

24
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:07,010
Actually I am the perfect
actor for the recently..

25
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,438
...announced film by Ms. Ekta.

26
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,603
And luckily even my name starts
with the letter K.

27
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,775
<i>Okay, you want to be launched as a hero?
- Yes, sir.</i>

28
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,609
Then do one thing,
become my assistant first.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,378
Because <i>I</i> came here
before you to become a hero,

30
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,505
<i>..and</i> even <i>my</i> name <i>starts with K.</i>

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,171
Kamlesh Chaturvedi.
You Stupid! Put the phone down.

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,846
Tired <i>of</i> taking <i>calls</i>
from fools like you.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,943
Sir,

34
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,938
First get the signature
of that person..

35
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,979
...who wrote on my hand..

36
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,741
...that my mother is a prostitute.

37
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:45,141
And then, sir I will go..

38
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,712
...with whomever
you want me to go with

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,144
Sir
- Hello.

40
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,713
Come on.
- Hello. Hello. Hello.

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,037
What are you doing Vishnu?
- Come on, what happened?

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,175
Even I want to be in the picture.

43
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,178
Believe me Sir, Shahrukh
sir is my uncle's good friend,

44
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,235
At least let me talk to him once.

45
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,677
My uncle studied
with him in Saint Columbus School.

46
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,508
<i>Okay, what is your uncle': name?</i>

47
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,103
Sir, my uncle's name
is Mr. Jagdish Maluji.

48
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,505
And he stays here
in Karol Bagh, Delhi.

49
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,345
<i>Is it the same person
who used</i> to <i>stay in..</i>

50
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,640
<i>..Telli Street before?
Hello!!!</i>

51
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,312
All good friends <i>of</i> Mr. Shahrukh
Khan are in Mumbai now.

52
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,506
Try your tricks somewhere else.
Got it!!

53
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:43,839
Haven't done anything?

54
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,070
I danced like Baby
Doll & Umrao jaan for you..

55
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,010
You cannot enjoy
my sexy dance for free!!

56
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:52,641
Look Imli, I did not pay
you for your dance. Understood?

57
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,002
Imli's dance is..

58
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,914
...more expensive
than her body. Got it?

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,638
Let's dance!

60
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,744
You are arguing, sir.

61
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:46,606
No, No. See you don't know. Look...

62
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,340
I don't care what
your boys did or didn't do..

63
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,142
We asked you to provide
food for 300 people.

64
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,177
Food provided was too less,

65
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,940
& we got insulted
in front of our guests.

66
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,406
This is not good.

67
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,140
The curry was so oily.

68
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,311
You... You...

69
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,973
If you would've eaten,
you would have known.

70
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,246
No. Don't talk to me like this.

71
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,509
Hold on for a second. Vishnu!

72
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,046
Paper is kept there,
I am getting the tea.

73
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,537
Yes. Yes.

74
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,176
I have used only 300 plates.

75
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,210
& you are charging for 400.

76
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,574
No no no.. you come &
Talk to me first.

77
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,805
Only then you will get paid.

78
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,972
Yes. Tea. - Yes. Listen.
- Yes. - Sit.

79
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,535
The kitchen is all messy.
- I need to talk to you.

80
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,240
Now?
- Yes, Please sit..

81
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,134
<i>Lara ,</i>

82
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,541
What happened?

83
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,443
Are you missing Guddi?

84
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,738
Even I am missing her a lot.

85
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,675
But that's fine,
Both of us are still here.

86
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,710
Mr. and Mrs. Shrivastav.

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,804
We have this house,
and everything we need.

88
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,471
We will be fine together.

89
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,046
Lata, I want to go to Mumbai.

90
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:20,439
Vishnu!

91
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,035
I have settled matters at office.

92
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,207
I am taking voluntary retirement,

93
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,245
From the money I get,
<i>I'll</i> create a fixed deposit.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,877
Everything will be fine.
I will go there,

95
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,207
and you can come after few days.

96
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,737
Then we will stay together.

97
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:38,671
There.

98
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:41,969
Okay!!

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,346
Now I get it,

100
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,006
why you were dancing..

101
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,807
...so wildly at Guddi's wedding.

102
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,640
You thought now you are free,

103
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,905
can do whatever you wish.

104
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,405
Lata, try to understand me.

105
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,877
What should I understand?

106
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,344
That my 52 years old husband..

107
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,141
...wants to go to Mumbai
to become an actor.

108
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,804
Have you lost your mind?

109
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,777
Lata so many people have done this?

110
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,176
Amrish Puri. Boman Irani.

111
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,769
Vishnu Shrivastav!!

112
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,973
The success ratio
is one in a million.

113
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,710
So, don't talk to me
about this again.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,707
What do you mean by that?

115
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,007
You had promised me.

116
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:30,871
What promise?

117
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,471
On Guddi's 5th birthday,

118
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,147
When I was supposed to
go to Mumbai.

119
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,075
You had stopped me and said

120
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:48,177
once Guddi is married,
I can do whatever I want.

121
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,277
Do you remember it?

122
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,041
Did you say this or not?

123
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,407
I don't know, I might have said so.

124
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,037
What do you mean by that?

125
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:02,006
I am an actor, an Actor!!

126
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:08,210
This boring 9 to 6 job kills me.

127
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,944
M r. Actor,

128
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,075
First learn to brush
your teeth properly.

129
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,340
Lata, what has
this got to do with..

130
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,836
Have warm water before leaving,

131
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,241
your gastric pain might increase.

132
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,702
And call Chawla,
he has called me 50 times.

133
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,246
Lata.
- He is asking for more money. - Lata.

134
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,971
All these things...
- First you will call him.

135
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:35,742
Why do you trap me
in these useless things every time?

136
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,844
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan,

137
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,477

Rohit. Rohit.

152
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,104
What are you doing inside?

153
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:55,241
Come outside, fast.

154
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,735
<i>The Aam Aadmi party government...</i>

155
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,813
...has completed <i>7</i>
days in Delhi today.

156
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,905
<i>But what did Delhi
get in these 7 days?</i>

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,106
<i>No free electricity,</i>
water or <i>Wi-Fi.</i>

158
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:11,244
People are asking were
all these promises false?

159
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,112
<i>Compared to last time, Mr. Kejriwal's
government</i> seems too <i>relaxed...</i>

160
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,441
How are your studies going?

161
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,868
Nice.

162
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,942
Son, what have you
thought about marriage?

163
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,440
Mama, please. Let me eat.

164
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,311
Nobody listens to me in this house.

165
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:50,007
Okay. Do whatever you want.

166
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,743
Mummy, should I get married
if brother doesn't want to?

167
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,347
I will give you a tight slap!!
Have your food quietly.

168
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,007
Bye, brother.
I am leaving. Good luck with mummy.

169
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,141
Mummy, I am going to Jeetu's house.

170
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,646
Sonu! Sonu, wait! Stop, Sonu!

171
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,613
Where are you going? God.

172
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,477
Oh God! This boy is always
roaming around with friends.

173
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:21,072
Not focused on studies at all.

174
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,973
What is my Mili eating?

175
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,240
You haven't paid
me for my old customer.

176
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,511
Forget that money,
I have got a solid deal for you.

177
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,345
What?
- Dubai.

178
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,245
The owner of a Big
Dubai based dance bar...

179
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,040
...has come here to buy girls.

180
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,942
I spoke to him about you,

181
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,813
and told him about
your sexy dance moves.

182
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:27,108
He is willing to
pay 5 Iakhs advance,

183
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,439
and 50 Iakhs a year.

184
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,439
It will change the
lives of three of us.

185
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,838
What do you say?

186
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,005
No. Not Dubai.

187
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,706
Why?

188
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:41,175
If I go to Dubai, my
Bollywood dreams will be shattered.

189
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,247
Again your Bollywood crap..

190
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,906
It has got more dirt than here.

191
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,545
Don't talk nonsense.
Look at Sunny Leone,

192
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,412
She used to work in bold pictures.

193
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,776
Now she is the number
one heroine of Bollywood.

194
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,712
Hey!! She has fair skin
and you are dark skinned.

195
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,674
There's huge difference.

196
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:02,080
It makes no difference to
Bollywood's directors and producers.

197
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,306
Whether skin is black or white,

198
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,745
It should have Talent!

199
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:10,503
Either you show your talent
on big screen or on bed.

200
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,512
And I have both of them.

201
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,409
Now go and get a
Bollywood director..

202
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:17,073
...or producer for me.
- Yes yes, I am leaving.

203
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,339
But remember,
you will repent one day.

204
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,112
Damn Dubai!!

205
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:32,106
8,245
- Yes

206
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:35,944
and 1,088.
- Yes. - Check this.

207
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,578
Mr. Raghuvanshi.
- Yes.

208
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:43,545
Just check if you can see
the figure 1,088 in the account.

209
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,971
1088, right?
- Yes. On the 8th number.

210
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,836
1088, right?
- Yes. Yes.

211
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,344
One minute, let me check.

212
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,343
Yes, 1088 is right.
- Okay. - Fine.

213
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,278
Holidays are about to begin.

214
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,104
Is anyone going anywhere?

215
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,477
Yes sir.
- Hmm.

216
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:12,004
I am planning to go to Kashmir.

217
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,844
Kashmir?

218
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,645
Why only Kashmir,
you can go to Switzerland also.

219
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,204
You have finished
lot of files this time.

220
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:26,508
Even I've heard a rumor.
- What?

221
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,237
The lady with the pretty lips,

222
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,473
who goes to restaurants with him.
- Really?

223
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,912
Yes, he is going with her.
- Is it? - Yes.

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,742
Don't be jealous.
Compete with me..

225
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,543
You have heard it right.

226
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:45,509
A Mouth has only two jobs,
to eat and to blabber.

227
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,407
Quiet everyone!

228
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,170
Quiet!

229
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,405
Quiet!

230
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,434
Quiet!

231
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,878
Raghuvanshi, shut up!
You won't say a word.

232
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,105
These Damn files!
I don't want to work on them.

233
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:06,910
I was an actor in college.
Best actor.

234
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:12,713
If you think I will sit here
and listen to your crazy talks...

235
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,040
Don't drive me crazy!!

236
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:23,143
(Murmuring)

237
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,179
(Murmuring)

238
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:30,974
(Murmuring)

239
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,513
(Murmuring)

240
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:37,745
(Murmuring)

241
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,406
(Murmuring)

242
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,268
Yeah.

243
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,679
Yes, sir?
- I want to meet director Rajat Arora.

244
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:05,240
Sir, you can meet him at the poolside.
- Thank you.

245
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,540
Are all arrangements done?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:10,308
Costumes? Have you taken
the measurements? - Yes.

247
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,145
There should not be any
last minute problems.

248
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,645
You know who our actress is.

249
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,179
She will come to the set and...
- No, it won't happen

250
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,677
Better you send
the stylist to her place.

251
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:21,247
Very good.
- As per the measurement.

252
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,471
Yes, Very good.

253
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,375
Actors complete.

254
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,709
All shortcomings have been discussed
with the coordinator? - All done.

255
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,177
Yes, sir.
- Our Story and characters.

256
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,372
Are more important.

257
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,102
Usually when there is a star..

258
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,703
...he overshadows everything.

259
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,837
Nobody pays attention
to the script.

260
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,641
They only go to watch the star.

261
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,844
The day we want to do
that, we will just pick

262
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,880
...any random story,
the star will sell it.

263
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,879
Absolutely right.
- We don't need to sell the story.

264
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:47,913
But in this film we need to sell
the story and the characters.

265
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,207
Right.

266
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,973
Okay?
- Excuse me sir. - Yes?

267
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,268
Hello.

268
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,142
Sir, I have watched all your films.

269
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,743
I am big fan of yours.
- Very good.

270
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,674
Sir, I am a very intense actor and
I want to work in your film.

271
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,342
Sir, acting is in my blood.
I am a born actor, sir.

272
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,038
Sir, I also know how to dance.

273
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,806
I have learned it from the famous
dance teacher Kuldeep Randhawa.

274
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,777
Sir, I will show you something.
- Actually...

275
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,746
Sir, I will, Sir I will...
- Our casting... - I will show something.

276
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,041
Listen to me.
- Sir, just see this. - We have...

277
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,211
We will venerate. We will venerate..
(Bollywood Song)

278
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:25,838
We will venerate. We will venerate.
(Bollywood Song)

279
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,744
We will venerate. We will venerate.
(Bollywood Song)

280
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,076
We will venerate. We will venerate.
(Bollywood Song)

281
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:34,307
Light boy. Light boy. Light boy.
(Bollywood Song)

282
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,904
Light boy. Light boy. Light boy.
(Bollywood Song)

283
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:45,387
"Yours & mine. Mine & yours.
Our love story is hard." (Bollywood Song)

284
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:51,509
"We cannot relate it in two sentences."
(Bollywood Song)

285
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,412
"Yours & mine. Mine & yours."
(Bollywood Song)

286
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,575
Our casting has been done,
try somewhere else.

287
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,544
Sir, please sign me
for your next film.

288
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,540
Sir, you haven't
seen my complete talent.

289
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,473
Sir, I will do an
emotional scene for you.

290
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,444
A woman is a mother.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

291
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,041
A woman is a sister.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

292
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,406
A woman is a wife.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

293
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:15,108
And when she is nothing she is a whore.
A whore. (Bollywood Film Dialogue)

294
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,572
Please leave. Please.

295
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,271
Sir, please watch
this action scene.

296
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,939
Once I have made a commitment
it is done. (Bollywood Film Dialogue)

297
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,204
Then I don't even listen to my father.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

298
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:29,142
A Common man is like a sleeping lion.
Don't tease. (Bollywood Film Dialogue)

299
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,544
If he wakes up, he will tear you apart.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

300
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:35,145
Father said that I should leave
the village. (Bollywood Film Dialogue)

301
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,941
The villagers said that I should
leave Paro. (Bollywood Film Dialogue)

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,638
Paro asked me to leave alcohol.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

303
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,805
Today you have asked me to stop acting.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

304
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,609
One day everyone will say leave the world.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

305
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:44,668
Leave the world.
(Bollywood Film Dialogue)

306
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:48,306
What to do? Wherever we go,
we always meet few like him.

307
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,402
And the problem is we cannot
even refuse them directly,

308
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:53,505
because they come with so much hope.
- It happens a lot.

309
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,709
I feel pity for them.

310
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,674
Where are you from?
- Delhi.

311
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,576
Jabalpur.
- Kolkata.

312
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,613
Kanpur.
- Benares.

313
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,773
Brother, don't say Benares.

314
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,870
Then?
- Say you're from Mumbai.

315
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,846
What would she do if I say Mumbai?

316
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,316
She will wrap herself
around you like a snake.

317
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,109
Imli. Imli.

318
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:27,507
Imli. Imli.

319
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:31,012
Look there is a customer
for you, from Mumbai.

320
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,349
"Who knows who has come
from my beloved's city."

321
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,442
"He has made my steps wonder."

322
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,706
"Who knows who has come
from my beloved's city."

323
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:56,240
"He has made my steps wonder."

324
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,045
"Someone please
tell me the secret."

325
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:06,473
"Why does my heart beat so fast?"

326
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:11,343
"Someone tell me
what's the secret."

327
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:17,181
"Why does my heart beat so fast?"

328
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,144
Oh God!

329
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:27,172
Okay. Okay. Leave. Leave.

330
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:30,676
Madam. Madam. Madam.

331
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:34,510
Rashid is lying. He is sending
everyone here posing as Mumbaikar.

332
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,637
And the man who has
come is not from Mumbai..

333
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,737
...but a thug from Howrah.

334
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:40,541
Step aside. Step aside!

335
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,907
- Can you make me meet
some Bollywood director?

336
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,241
Imli.

337
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,337
Imli!

338
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,908
Imli!

339
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:49,413
The man you are sleeping
with is not from Mumbai..

340
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,003
...but a thug from Howrah.

341
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,238
You are not from Mumbai?

342
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,010
First let's finish this,
then I will tell you.

343
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:08,905
Imli.

344
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:10,768
Imli.

345
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:12,673
Imli.

346
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:15,509
What's the difference whether
I am from Mumbai or Kolkata?

347
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,744
I have paid you the full amount.

348
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,372
Then why did you lie?

349
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,073
By pretending to be from Mumbai you
want exotic pleasure for free.

350
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,140
You are calling me selfish?

351
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,835
In spite of the fact that...

352
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,344
Yes, I am calling you selfish.

353
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:33,902
And that's...

354
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:37,238
...because even I have
many unfulfilled dreams.

355
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:41,413
But that doesn't mean that
I'd leave everything and go.

356
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,378
Lata, I have never stopped you.

357
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,674
Did I ever stop you
from doing anything?

358
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:48,238
Or did I stop any
other family member?

359
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,443
Then why am I being stopped?
- Don't shout.

360
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,844
Even I have dreams
which I want to fulfill.

361
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,004
Father stopped me in childhood

362
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,512
now you are stopping me.

363
00:22:58,733 --> 00:22:59,768
Is it Mishra?

364
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,237
Who is it?

365
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:08,137
Who is it?

366
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,439
Surprise!

367
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,771
My Baby!

368
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,541
Papa, she was missing you a lot.

369
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,704
Even we were missing both of you.

370
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,271
In fact, this evening we
were talking about you only..

371
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,710
Look, she had a long face before,
but now it's glowing!

372
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,508
Come on in. Let's go inside.

373
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:35,569
Great. Great.

374
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,705
Mummy very nice,
do let me know the recipe.

375
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,337
Of course. Of course.

376
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,638
I will just come.

377
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,904
Listen to this..
- Yes..

378
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:49,969
She won't tell you the recipe.

379
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,137
Papa.

380
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,235
I am telling the truth.

381
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,008
Once someone asked her the recipe
for fritter dish.

382
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,075
She told him everything,
except about the fritters.

383
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,010
Papa, please.
You are lying. You are lying, papa.

384
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,980
- I swear.
He ate and said that's good,

385
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:07,573
but where are the fritters?
- Papa, you act so good.

386
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,679
Papa, you used to do theatre, right?
- Yes.

387
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,941
Didn't you tell him?
- Yes, I did.

388
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:15,445
Guddi told me that you were
a very good actor in college.

389
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:22,613
Around that time I was part of
Mr. Habib Tanvir's "Naya Theatre Group".

390
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,209
Did 7 plays with them.
- Hmm, Good papa.

391
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,047
Papa, then
why didn't you continue acting?

392
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,769
Because son,

393
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,647
Acting is a meaningless pursuit,
which cannot run the house.

394
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:44,941
You were asking me about the
cottage cheese recipe... - Lata.

395
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:49,913
Chetan has asked
an important question.

396
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,872
That why didn't
I follow my passion?

397
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,308
It must be answered!!

398
00:24:56,567 --> 00:25:00,071
Chetan, what does
a middle class boy do?

399
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,143
First, he completes his studies,
then gets a job.

400
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,304
And then he gets married.

401
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:10,213
And eventually, all his dreams gets
buried under his responsibilities.

402
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:15,573
So that's why I am here,
sector 10, Bhilai.

403
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:19,273
I eat delicious cottage cheese dishes
prepared by your mother-in-law.

404
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,209
I do suffer from gastric
but rest is fine.

405
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,444
That's why Chetan.

406
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,377
If you want to do
something in life then do it.

407
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,946
Don't wait for the right moment.

408
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:38,072
Because often, that right moment
never comes.

409
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,376
You promised me.

410
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,470
You did promise me Lata!

411
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,142
May I come in, sir?
- Yes.

412
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,876
Rohit, what are these
unwanted Mumbai logs?

413
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,579
They are calls, sir.
Important calls.

414
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,640
Are you sure?

415
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:01,044
<i>Sir, even you couldn't recognize...</i>

416
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,407
...Anupam Kher's talent
in the beginning.

417
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,145
<i>Sir, you might remember
that when he was.</i>

418
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,573
..leaving Boll;/wood
& returning to his village..

419
00:28:07,934 --> 00:28:10,210
...you had called <i>him</i>
back from the station.

420
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,404
And <i>that's</i> how film
'Saaransh' was born.

421
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,906
Sir, even <i>I am looking</i>
for such an opportunity.

422
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,979
What is this?

423
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,070
You are using
company's infra-structure.

424
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,272
...for your personal
acting struggle.

425
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:28,910
You should be ashamed.

426
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,405
Anyway it's not so
easy to become an actor.

427
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,480
Otherwise in Delhi 80 percent of
the people would have been actors.

428
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,411
Mail him only specific logs.

429
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,743
No random logs.

430
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,407
And Rohit.
This is your last warning.

431
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:48,341
Next time...

432
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,507
Then do acting only.

433
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,043
Hello?

434
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,942
I want to meet Imli.

435
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,771
You are from Mumbai..

436
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,744
Yes. How do you know that?

437
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,646
This is my Mumbai's
driving license,

438
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,304
And this is my
Director's association card.

439
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
And take this...
check whatever you want to.

440
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,679
My name is Daman.

441
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,805
Since when I am telling you
that I am from Mumbai.

442
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,210
But none of you listened to me.

443
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,007
You all bashed me.

444
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,110
What can we do?

445
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,074
What?

446
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:48,843
Your Face!! It looks as if
you are from Orissa, not Mumbai.

447
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,515
Hello Madam,
I am an assistant director.

448
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,241
I have worked in many major
films in Bollywood, Mumbai.

449
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,711
Now I am writing my own script.

450
00:31:57,767 --> 00:31:59,576
And It's my mistake, that
I've come here to do my research.

451
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,237
What are you doing?

452
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,508
You... You. Get up.

453
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,668
Tell her...

454
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:16,079
Unknowingly, we all have made a
big mistake.

455
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,646
It's fine. No problem.

456
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:19,475
Please forgive us.

457
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,177
Yes, okay.

458
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,816
And just give us a chance
to make you feel special.

459
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:32,514
Just one chance!

460
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:34,875
Only one chance...

461
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,305
And I promise you...

462
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:46,376
...you will forget all your
pretty heroines of Bollywood

463
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,146
and become my slave.

464
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:55,506
Very good. Very good.

465
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:01,816
"Fragrance. Happiness.
Dreams. Desires."

466
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:06,679
"You have got all
of them with you."

467
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,506
"You have showered me with petals."

468
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:17,172
"And made me all fragrant."

469
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,447
"Someone tell me the secret."

470
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,747
"Why is my heart beating so fast?"

471
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,845
"Someone tell me the secret."

472
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:37,946
"Why is my heart beating so fast?"

473
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:43,173
"Someone tell me the secret."

474
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:51,452
"Why is my heart beating so fast?"

475
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,778
What? You... One minute.
Hello. You... Wait. Wait.

476
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,576
Wait. Wait. I have not
come here for this research.

477
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:03,607
Then?
- I need to complete my script.

478
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,374
And for that I require
real life characters.

479
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:07,469
Real life characters.
Do you understand?

480
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,906
Story?

481
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,942
Yes. A Story.

482
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,475
A sensible story which
can be made into a good film.

483
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:07,944
By the way, even I have a story.

484
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:12,176
You have it?
Please don't tell me this.

485
00:35:12,434 --> 00:35:16,280
You just help me with my research.

486
00:35:16,634 --> 00:35:18,978
I know how to write a story.

487
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:20,602
Okay?

488
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:42,113
My mother was a prostitute like me.

489
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,077
She was a big film buff &
fell in love with a film director.

490
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:56,941
A love, which was
above all boundaries.

491
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,339
Which could not be defined.

492
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,340
Her love was magical!

493
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:08,140
Magical!

494
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:14,943
Neither that film director
visited our brothel.

495
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:18,704
Nor my mother met him.

496
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,775
But mother loved that
director so madly..

497
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:30,012
...that she would look for him
in all her customers.

498
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:32,042
She was crazy.

499
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:34,469
Really crazy.

500
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:40,181
And I am the souvenir
of that craziness.

501
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:45,046
At First, I didn't believe my
Mother's tale.

502
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,507
But when I felt the same madness
for films..

503
00:36:50,234 --> 00:36:53,443
...I realized, there is surely
some truth in my mother's tale.

504
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,273
What happened?

505
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,008
Please continue.

506
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,010
A classic film can
be made on this story.

507
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:12,447
I told you I can help.

508
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,640
By the way, this is just
a small part of the story.

509
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,712
Do you want to listen
to the entire story?

510
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,504
Yes, of course.

511
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:29,175
How do you want to hear the story?

512
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:34,244
While sitting or...?

513
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:44,937
Tell me...

514
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:51,282
...everything,
exactly as it happened.

515
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:55,175
Please.

516
00:37:55,267 --> 00:37:58,407
At 50, our friend is taking
voluntary retirement and going to Mumbai.

517
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,709
If you want to fulfill your
dreams then age does not matter.

518
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,541
Even I wanted to go to Mumbai,

519
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,569
to do something.

520
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,977
But to secure your future
I didn't... Let it be...

521
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,873
He'll be back in few days.

522
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,975
Even the best couldn't succeed.

523
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,646
And he will do it, at this age?

524
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:22,846
He will do it.
He will act as Heroine's Father...

525
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:28,845
Wonderful!

526
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,607
Wonderful! Wonderful!

527
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,507
Wonderful! Wonderful!

528
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:45,879
Where are you?
- Vishnu ji I am here. - You are here.

529
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,477
Papa speech!
- Yes,

530
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:50,939
Excuse me. Excuse me.

531
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,880
Now Papa, will give a speech.
- Wow.

532
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:10,274
Thank you everyone,

533
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:13,813
for coming here today.

534
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:21,410
Today is the most
beautiful day of my life.

535
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:27,876
Because from now on
I will start doing...

536
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,577
...what I always wanted to.

537
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:37,706
I know, most of
you must be thinking..

538
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,713
...why am I doing it at this age.

539
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,974
Some of you even think
that I have gone mad.

540
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:45,776
I know, you have said so to Lata.
- Vishnu.

541
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,143
I want to assure all of you...

542
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,271
...that l have really gone mad.

543
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:57,641
No, papa, No.
We are with you.

544
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,441
I have really gone mad.

545
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,106
And I am very happy that
I have gone mad.

546
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:08,972
I just regret one thing,
why didn't I allow myself..

547
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:13,141
...to go mad, for so many years.

548
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:20,972
And maybe, keeping this in mind,
a poet has written.

549
00:40:22,234 --> 00:40:24,214
"You will find your goal."

550
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,242
"You will find your goal
eventually, even after wandering."

551
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,078
"Lost are those who
never left their homes."

552
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:35,841
Wonderful! Love you, papa.

553
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,902
This sounds like a speech
for Filmfare award.

554
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:42,973
Who said so?
- Patil. - Mr. Patil. Sure. Sure.

555
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,504
I will surely mention your name
when I win the Filmfare award.

556
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,539
Filmfare?
- Yes, papa, Filmfare.

557
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,710
For this Filmfare I'd like
to thank Mr. Habib Tanvir ..

558
00:40:58,234 --> 00:41:00,578
...my friends at Nehru
Cultural center.

559
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:02,773
- Mr. Patil.

560
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:06,646
And I want to thank..

561
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,247
...Sajid Bhai from
Bhilai Steel Plant.

562
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:14,440
My teacher, Mr. Sharma from MGM school.
- Vishnu.

563
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,970
Nanhe Coffee Shop at
the Civic center.

564
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:19,410
Papa, are you OK?

565
00:41:24,534 --> 00:41:29,449
Papa. - Papa. - Lata!
- Papa. - Papa. - Vishnu! Vishnu!

566
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,802
Sit. Sit.

567
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,377
Did he get any such attack before?

568
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:09,037
No, sir. Never.

569
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:14,040
But he always used to have
stomach ache because of gastric.

570
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,073
That's why we never
took it seriously.

571
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,838
Well, you should
have taken it seriously.

572
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,671
What do you mean?

573
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:26,113
I am sorry to say,
he has Pancreatic Cancer,

574
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,670
It's in third stage.

575
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:32,473
There is a slim chance of survival.

576
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,140
Mummy!

577
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,911
Shall we leave?

578
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:54,175
Not now, Vishnu.

579
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,475
Right now you need to rest.

580
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:06,941
It's time for me to work,

581
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,271
and you are asking me to rest.

582
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,046
Bollywood is waiting for me.

583
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,646
Bollywoood is waiting for me.

584
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,438
Vishnu.

585
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,409
Vishnu.
- Hmm.

586
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:47,679
Please don't insist.

587
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,577
You are not well.

588
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:56,007
You cannot go to Mumbai.

589
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,443
I have taken retirement,

590
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,906
have thrown a party.

591
00:45:06,267 --> 00:45:07,837
And you are saying
I cannot go to Mumbai..

592
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,140
Is it a joke?

593
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:11,247
It is not a joke.
- It is a joke. What else?

594
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:15,304
Sit. Sit. Sit.

595
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:22,077
I know what's wrong with me.

596
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,572
It's Gastric pain.

597
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:29,475
It's been happening
since many years.

598
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:32,872
This time,
it just got a bit severe.

599
00:45:33,134 --> 00:45:36,138
Chetan, please go and
do the documentation.

600
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,240
I have insurance, bills will be
paid by my office.

601
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,838
Chetan, please go.
- Vishnu, you have Cancer.

602
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:53,241
Pancreatic cancer.

603
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,646
Third stage.

604
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:11,937
Good.

605
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:17,610
Your plan to stop me
from going to Mumbai is good.

606
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,401
Lata.

607
00:46:23,234 --> 00:46:26,841
But I am not going to get trapped
in your act any more.

608
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,735
Nothing is wrong with me.

609
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:34,303
Vishnu, I am not acting.

610
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,176
You really have cancer.

611
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:51,817
"The sand gets washed
off by the water."

612
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:58,045
"Or they are the
illusions of the eye."

613
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:04,346
"Even our goal changes its form."

614
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,510
"They look strange and unique."

615
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,638
"What kind of journey is this?"

616
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:17,040
"I can't see anything."

617
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,081
"This is an unsolved riddle."

618
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:23,206
"Someone should solve it."

619
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:31,185
"Even every dawn and
dusk is not red."

620
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:37,480
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

621
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:43,813
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

622
00:47:43,867 --> 00:47:47,007
"My heart. My Heart."

623
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:50,207
"Trying to find. Trying to find."

624
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,510
"My heart. My Heart."

625
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:57,982
"Trying to find,
the desired flower."

626
00:47:58,067 --> 00:48:04,382
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

627
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:07,346
"My heart. My Heart."

628
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:11,405
"Trying to find. Trying to find."

629
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:43,876
"My dreams are full of ocean."

630
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:49,243
"But still my eyes are dry."

631
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:56,578
"Oh the waves, they drown me"

632
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:02,342
"Now it is a sea of wishes."

633
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:05,708
"What kind of madness is this?"

634
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:09,214
"What kind of devotion?"

635
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,680
"There is a sea of love."

636
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:20,048
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

637
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:26,142
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

638
00:49:26,234 --> 00:49:29,443
"My heart. My Heart."

639
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,606
"Trying to find. Trying to find."

640
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,579
"My heart. My Heart."

641
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:40,375
"Trying to find,
the desired flower."

642
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:46,612
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

643
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:50,305
"My heart. My Heart."

644
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,870
"Trying to find. Trying to find."

645
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:26,614
"From earth to sky,
my arms are open."

646
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:31,878
"Even my heart is a winner today."

647
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:39,213
"Someone tell me if
it's real or a dream."

648
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:45,216
"What is this pleasant View here?"

649
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:51,876
"Somebody should have read
My heart."

650
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:56,177
"Whatever is outside
is also inside here."

651
00:50:56,234 --> 00:51:02,549
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

652
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:08,243
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

653
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,041
"My heart. My Heart."

654
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,104
"Trying to find. Trying to find."

655
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:21,118
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

656
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:27,349
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

657
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:30,805
"My heart. My Heart."

658
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:33,848
"Trying to find. Trying to find."

659
00:51:34,034 --> 00:51:40,383
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

660
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:46,441
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

661
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:52,776
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

662
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:58,383
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

663
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:05,240
"My heart is trying
to find the desired flower."

664
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,141
"My heart. My Heart."

665
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:12,977
"Trying to find. Trying to find."

666
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:18,038
Welcome back to Rajasthan
Herbals International Presents.

667
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,546
"Bollywood Star Hunt Show"

668
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,412
Yes, friends, after so many
auditions we are here in Delhi.

669
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,537
Now we will speak to our judges
- Absolutely.

670
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,841
And ask them what are
their expectations from Delhi.

671
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:32,015
Look, it is a huge privilege
for me to be a part of this show.

672
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:34,809
And I am very happy that we
have come to Delhi for auditions.

673
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,107
And I am expecting the world.

674
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,612
I'm sure people here
will perform very well.

675
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:40,408
So we are looking forward
to some great performances.

676
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:42,674
I'm a drug addict, a
lecher

677
00:52:42,734 --> 00:52:46,147
I drink alcohol too,
But I pay for it from my own pocket.

678
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:48,769
And like a brave man
I speak the truth.

679
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:51,609
Not like my Hypocritical neighbours.

680
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,408
I am a straight forward person.
I speak the truth.

681
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,208
No, but on a very serious note,
very good performance.

682
00:52:57,767 --> 00:52:58,745
- Papa,

683
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,980
this is not how you play this game.

684
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,339
Are you playing some other game?

685
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:08,774
Papa, it's hurting.
Please, let me go papa.

686
00:53:09,134 --> 00:53:12,479
No. Papa, no. No.

687
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:14,979
What a moving performance.
I mean...

688
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:16,444
We really don't have words.

689
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,039
So tell us your name.

690
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:21,109
Rohit.

691
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,508
What are you going
to perform today?

692
00:53:22,734 --> 00:53:24,714
Sir, scene is
from the film 'Baazigar'.

693
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:28,744
But I want to perform it
in my unique style.

694
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:30,973
Sure. - Very good.
- Even we want something original.

695
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:34,742
Of course. Of course. Come on, start.
- All the best.

696
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,840
What is he doing?

697
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:44,970
Hope, you haven't
called a magician?

698
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,339
Doesn't he look
strange and scared ?

699
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,879
Beer!
- Yes.

700
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:51,311
Wow. Party.
- Yes.

701
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:52,869
You were talking about
Alcohol...

702
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,178
Here it is.

703
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,642
Shit!

704
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:07,277
God!
- Madan Chopra!

705
00:54:09,367 --> 00:54:10,937
Do you remember? Do you remember?

706
00:54:11,034 --> 00:54:12,536
That day you were sitting there.

707
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,602
And my mother was
standing in front of you..

708
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,044
...and begging
you for her own wealth.

709
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:21,008
This is the same
chair Madan Chopra..

710
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,649
...where you had destined
my father and sister to death.

711
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,109
And threw my mother into a shock,
And put me into a life full of struggles.

712
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,806
Madan Chopra.

713
00:54:36,267 --> 00:54:38,304
The blood which has
been flowing through.

714
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,505
...my mother's eyes like
tears for so many years.

715
00:54:40,734 --> 00:54:46,309
Today, You have opened
the floodgates!! Madan Chopra.

716
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:50,613
Now a strong flood will come

717
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,738
Flood will come. Flood will come.

718
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,174
Flood will come. - Anybody here?
Please give him some first aid.

719
00:55:02,434 --> 00:55:05,176
Are you okay?
- What do you think?

720
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,548
My God.
This is bizarre. Is he insane?

721
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,908
What was that?

722
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,376
Listen he has intensity,

723
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:19,109
Please.
- But acting is zero.

724
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,202
We can use his intensity, right?

725
00:55:21,733 --> 00:55:24,475
At least it will raise
the TRP of our show.

726
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,844
Are you serious?
- Of course, I am serious.

727
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,110
I agree that audience
likes such things.

728
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,802
But this is madness.

729
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:39,043
This is madness
- One minute.

730
00:55:39,134 --> 00:55:40,943
What are you guys saying?
- What?

731
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,911
Neither he has
cinematic presence,

732
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:44,071
nor does he have
any acting technique.

733
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:46,875
Even his voice is not good.
He will bore the audience.

734
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:48,969
It's okay. Let's take him to the next round,
will figure out the rest later.

735
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:53,379
He doesn't even have
good pronunciation.

736
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:54,412
- Rohit.

737
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,743
I have never seen such madness.

738
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,877
...for Bollywood in my entire life.

739
00:56:01,967 --> 00:56:05,244
I think you were
just brilliant. Bravo!

740
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,573
Amazing performance.

741
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,734
Very nice.
- Really.

742
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,748
I mean, how did you get
so much passion for Bollywood?

743
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,312
Bollywood cinema is not
just entertainment for me.

744
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:24,544
It is my life.

745
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,970
It is my world.

746
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:32,673
Bollywood Cinema has inspired
me at every corner of my life.

747
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,446
I have learnt a lot
from Bollywood cinema.

748
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,839
If there was no Bollywood Cinema...

749
00:56:41,634 --> 00:56:43,272
...I wouldn't have existed.

750
00:56:45,867 --> 00:56:47,471
This is called true madness
for Bollywood.

751
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:50,276
I salute you man.
What a performance!

752
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,945
Very nice performance.

753
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:55,975
Amazing performance, man. Wow!

754
00:56:58,734 --> 00:57:00,680
Very nice. We are very impressed.

755
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:01,905
And what else should we tell you?

756
00:57:01,967 --> 00:57:05,471
Just Come and take your card.
- Take it.

757
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,709
Congratulations.

758
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,303
You have got the entry
card for the second round.

759
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,038
Thank you.
- How do you feel?

760
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,672
I am feeling very good.

761
00:57:19,734 --> 00:57:22,681
I feel as if,
now my goal is not far away.

762
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:25,647
Great! How was your
whole experience?

763
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,273
You know Judges,
a huge stage, such a huge show.

764
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:34,279
Like a dream.
- How sweet.

765
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,449
So this is Rohit, who has
just cleared his first round.

766
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:00,074
IMLI.

767
00:58:02,134 --> 00:58:03,909
Imli?
- Imli.

768
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,247
Imli.
- Can this film be named IMLI? - Why not?

769
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,837
In fact this name
is the soul of this film.

770
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:20,138
Okay, listen.

771
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:28,008
I have a surprise for you.
Ask me what?

772
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:29,604
What?

773
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:34,003
You are my Imli.

774
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,670
Yes.

775
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:42,547
You know, on screen, nobody
can play Imli better than you.

776
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:46,706
Your dream will be fulfilled.

777
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:50,846
Now I need your good
photographs which..

778
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,541
...I will carry to Mumbai
and show them to my producers.

779
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:59,444
And as soon as I find my producer,
I will call you to Mumbai.

780
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:06,608
What?

781
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,977
Hello? What happened?

782
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,772
Though late.

783
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,841
But Goddess Kali
has answered my prayers.

784
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:23,635
Yes, Goddess Kali always listens

785
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,441
to her pure devotees.

786
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,475
But there is a small problem.

787
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,278
For your portfolio, I need to
hire a camera, lights, costumes &..

788
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:41,242
...a good photographer.

789
00:59:41,867 --> 00:59:47,112
And I think it will
cost around 1 or 1.5 Iakhs.

790
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:50,005
And you know that my money is over.

791
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:55,107
But I have spoken to my friends...
Let's see what can be done...

792
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,372
I will do something.

793
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:10,243
Imli, what are you doing?

794
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,911
Stop running after Bollywood.

795
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,007
I am telling you,
it is not good for you at all.

796
01:00:17,434 --> 01:00:19,004
Think about it once.

797
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:22,844
This is your hard earned money.

798
01:00:23,234 --> 01:00:27,080
You have saved it.
It's your dream.

799
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:30,376
Your mother's dream that Mili
should study in a boarding school.

800
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,612
Stop getting involved with
Daman and his Bollywood film.

801
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:38,077
Understood?
- I know, Madam, I know.

802
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,671
But I trust Daman thoroughly.

803
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:42,543
I am sure he will
do something for me.

804
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:46,509
And once I shine on the big screen,
You will see...

805
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:49,609
The boarding school which
is refusing to take Mili..

806
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,306
...will come running after her.

807
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:55,411
They will chase her,
Madam. Really!

808
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,243
What if you don't
come on the big screen?

809
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:03,941
What will you do then?

810
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,742
I will, Madam.
I will shine on big screen.

811
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:10,441
Goddess Kali is with me.

812
01:01:32,367 --> 01:01:33,402
This...

813
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:35,545
Imli.

814
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:39,348
You had kept this
money for Mili, right?

815
01:01:42,367 --> 01:01:44,779
You are doing what
I should have done.

816
01:01:47,134 --> 01:01:50,047
I am sorry.
I am not able to help you at all.

817
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,673
C'mon! You are helping me.

818
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,274
You have written a story for me.

819
01:01:56,334 --> 01:01:58,041
You will click my pictures.

820
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,546
You will cast me in your film.

821
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:05,507
Daman Sir, without you my dream
can't be fulfilled.

822
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:12,507
Come on. Now do it.

823
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,206
What?

824
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,738
Take my pictures.

825
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,742
Now?
- Yes, now.

826
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,503
All right. - Come.
- It's a good idea. A good idea.

827
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:25,946
I will teach you how to
pose in front of the camera.

828
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:29,476
Do you know what is posing?
- Yes?

829
01:02:29,867 --> 01:02:32,074
What is it? Pose for me.

830
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,807
I will tell you.
Who's your favorite?

831
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:36,308
Your favorite is
Sunny Leone, right?

832
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,073
One minute,
I will take something from here.

833
01:02:38,134 --> 01:02:39,807
What should I take?
Yes, this. This.

834
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:43,771
How will you pose this way?

835
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,104
Look mainly in the eyes,

836
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:49,512
What's in the eyes?
And how is it?

837
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:50,675
See.

838
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,079
<i>The pictures mat we are seeing,</i>

839
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:55,306
It is hard to believe
that this is noon time.

840
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,173
Of course Meenakshi.
It happened suddenly.

841
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:00,544
<i>And everyone was surprised
to see such pictures.</i>

842
01:03:00,634 --> 01:03:02,910
It became very dark.
started raining heavily..

843
01:03:02,967 --> 01:03:04,275
There were fast winds.

844
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:08,074
<i>In</i> Indian culture
mortality is considered.

845
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,438
<i>...as the reason for sorrow.</i>

846
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:16,515
<i>This world. Birth. Life. Death.</i>

847
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,679
<i>They are me center of mortality.</i>

848
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,648
And to be free <i>of</i> these
attachments is liberation.

849
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:29,705
<i>Liberation is the final
stage of human me.</i>

850
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:33,576
It is considered as
the most important thing..

851
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:38,308
<i>..The Supreme goal of life.</i>

852
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:44,610
It is difficult to accept Liberation,
being attached to material world.

853
01:03:45,234 --> 01:03:50,411
<i>That's why in most philosophies.</i>

854
01:03:50,867 --> 01:03:53,006
<i>liberation is a personal journey.</i>

855
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:56,946
<i>That's why it is proven only..</i>

856
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,076
<i>...to be a personal experience.</i>

857
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:06,476
<i>In Scriptures state of bliss is..</i>

858
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:08,647
<i>..considered as liberation.</i>

859
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:15,007
Because in blissfulness
you realize that you are a soul.

860
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,844
<i>This is the state
of inner conscience.</i>

861
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:22,647
It can be experienced
in this very life.

862
01:04:33,367 --> 01:04:35,108
Lata!
- What happened? Is it paining?

863
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,543
Lata.
- Yes. Listen.

864
01:04:39,734 --> 01:04:41,213
I want to meet Sunder Das.

865
01:04:42,234 --> 01:04:44,339
Sunder Das?
- Sunder Das.

866
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:48,777
I will call him tomorrow.
- Now.

867
01:04:49,867 --> 01:04:51,904
Now, At night?
- Now.

868
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:54,213
But how can I call him at midnight?

869
01:04:56,934 --> 01:05:00,882
I don't have time. I am dying.

870
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:09,209
Liberation is the ultimate
goal of life.

871
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:13,313
Liberation is the
path which leads to..

872
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,545
...freedom from the cycle
of birth and death.

873
01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:20,615
Liberation is the door to wisdom..

874
01:05:20,867 --> 01:05:25,441
...peace and ultimate happiness.
On the path of liberation.

875
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:28,077
<i>Guru}'L You are misunderstanding me.</i>

876
01:05:32,134 --> 01:05:36,446
Guruji, I have not called
you here to attain liberation.

877
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:44,043
Guruji, Since childhood I
wanted to be an actor.

878
01:05:44,867 --> 01:05:48,838
But now this is not
possible for me in this lifetime.

879
01:05:50,467 --> 01:05:53,812
And even if I get liberation..

880
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,506
...It will be of no help...

881
01:05:57,067 --> 01:06:01,607
Because, the reason I am here in this
world, has not been accomplished yet.

882
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:06,638
And Since many years
I've been listening to..

883
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:10,870
...your discourses on various..

884
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,747
...topics like, soul..

885
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,610
...supreme soul, liberation,
re-incarnation etc.

886
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:23,574
That's why I am sure that.

887
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,079
...you can do this for me.

888
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:29,976
Do what?
- Guruji,

889
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,646
I want to take rebirth
again in this world.

890
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,904
That too In Mumbai.

891
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,974
In the family of a Bollywood star.

892
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:52,544
You have to do this for me.

893
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:57,046
Vishnu. Vishnu.
- You have to do this for me, Guruji.

894
01:06:57,334 --> 01:07:00,440
Vishnu.
- You have to do this for me. - Vishnu.

895
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,381
I came here to show
you the path to liberation.

896
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,707
But you want to get trapped
in the web of illusion again?

897
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,470
Bollywood?
- Yes.

898
01:07:15,467 --> 01:07:19,882
I cannot destroy your future..

899
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,043
...and your afterlife.

900
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,041
Guruji, you have to help me.

901
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,743
Guruji, you have to help me.

902
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:31,881
Sorry. Forgive me.

903
01:07:40,434 --> 01:07:42,436
What's all this, Vishnu?

904
01:07:45,267 --> 01:07:47,747
It's my final wish, Lata.

905
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:52,912
Guruji.

906
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:56,807
I know his wish is very weird.

907
01:07:57,334 --> 01:07:58,608
It's madness.

908
01:07:59,934 --> 01:08:01,379
But believe me.

909
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,413
He lived his entire life for others.

910
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:10,748
He never frowned.
He never complained.

911
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:17,743
He never spent a
single rupee on himself.

912
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:21,973
Now, If he wants to do something
in the last moments.

913
01:08:22,067 --> 01:08:25,537
Then how can I leave his side?

914
01:08:27,734 --> 01:08:28,838
Guruji.

915
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,573
Please give me a chance
to do something for Vishnu.

916
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,844
If a Human being wants to take
rebirth as per his wish..

917
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,413
...then, first, as per the scriptures
he has to follow strict rules..

918
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,276
...and perform certain Rituals,
sacrifices and charity.

919
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:56,871
This cleanses all his past sins.

920
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:02,116
And his next birth is not
decided by his previous actions.

921
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,707
And eventually, he
must depart along with..

922
01:09:07,067 --> 01:09:11,345
<i>...his "Akaanshit Chetan Mann."</i>

923
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:13,747
<i>"Akaanshit Chetan Mann?"</i>

924
01:09:13,967 --> 01:09:16,038
<i>Yes, "Desired conscious mind."</i>

925
01:09:17,034 --> 01:09:18,809
The last thought ..

926
01:09:19,234 --> 01:09:22,613
...a man has while dying..

927
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,605
...decides the course
of his next life.

928
01:09:28,067 --> 01:09:33,107
That's why, in your final moments

929
01:09:33,434 --> 01:09:35,710
...you will have to completely
concentrate on your goal.

930
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:40,140
Only then you will
have the next life of your choice.

931
01:09:40,767 --> 01:09:45,716
And if you lose your
concentration even a little..

932
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,402
...then everything will be ruined.

933
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:57,414
So Mr. Vishnu,
do you really want to do this?

934
01:10:01,434 --> 01:10:03,277
Guruji, I don't have any option.

935
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,677
I can't face this rejection.

936
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,779
Tia's father doesn't know that he is in
that position because of my father.

937
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,445
My fate has brought
me to such a turn..

938
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,414
...where my sad life
has embraced death.

939
01:10:40,734 --> 01:10:43,442
I am telling the truth, Acosta.

940
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,272
Oh shit!

941
01:10:58,234 --> 01:10:59,907
I swear on this blood.

942
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:02,780
I swear on this name
which is written on my heart.

943
01:11:03,101 --> 01:11:05,206
You are mine, Only Mine.

944
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,707
I told you this boy would raise our TRP.
- Come on.

945
01:11:08,534 --> 01:11:13,313
These wedding rituals, this holy fire
these mantras, everything is a sham.

946
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,473
Sunil has betrayed you.
He has betrayed you.

947
01:11:18,467 --> 01:11:20,913
The Vermilion he
has put in your hair.

948
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,538
I will wash it off
with his blood. I swear.

949
01:11:25,967 --> 01:11:28,538
Kiran, you are mine, Only mine.

950
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,103
No one can separate us.

951
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,738
I love you, Kiran.
I love you, Kiran.

952
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,543
I love you, Kiran.
I love you, Kiran.

953
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,581
I love you, Kiran.
- First aid!

954
01:11:41,634 --> 01:11:42,669
Are you okay?

955
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,069
I told you before that
he will do something wrong.

956
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:48,077
It's all right. Don't worry.

957
01:11:48,134 --> 01:11:49,545
This is crazy..

958
01:11:49,601 --> 01:11:50,671
You saw what he just did..

959
01:11:50,734 --> 01:11:52,839
I mean, this could have been fatal.

960
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:55,442
Come on, it's OK.

961
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,706
He is all right.

962
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,006
All well?

963
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:01,405
Rohit, what is this?

964
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:04,776
I can understand your passion,

965
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:08,077
...madness for Bollywood
but what is this?

966
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:10,276
You are not allowed
to hurt yourself.

967
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,806
No more blood!

968
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:20,580
But Rohit.

969
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:24,041
You are free...

970
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:28,280
...to try something different
for the 3rd & final round.

971
01:12:52,467 --> 01:12:55,380
Mummy, television reporters have come.

972
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,071
Look, this is the house
Where our future super star lives.

973
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,337
This is the place
where Rohit must have..

974
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:04,779
...played and acted a lot.

975
01:13:04,867 --> 01:13:06,778
And that's why he
is so famous today.

976
01:13:06,867 --> 01:13:09,575
Come let me introduce
you to Rohit's mother.

977
01:13:09,634 --> 01:13:14,049
So Mrs. Jassi how do you
feel after seeing your son on TV?

978
01:13:14,301 --> 01:13:19,444
I always knew that
my Rohit is very talented,

979
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,037
and he will make us proud one day.

980
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,273
Brother, the TV reporters are here.

981
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:25,972
So Rohit, what do you think?

982
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:28,513
Are you going to clear
the third round and go to Mumbai?

983
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:31,309
Definitely, I am going
to clear the third round..

984
01:13:31,534 --> 01:13:32,774
...and I am going to Mumbai.

985
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:34,168
Great.

986
01:13:34,267 --> 01:13:37,612
What do you want to say
to your fans and viewers?

987
01:13:42,234 --> 01:13:47,081
I want to tell my fans not
to try my acting stunts at home.

988
01:13:47,534 --> 01:13:49,377
They might be dangerous.

989
01:13:49,867 --> 01:13:51,676
And Rohit won't be responsible for it.

990
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,444
Absolutely.
And even we want to tell you that.

991
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:59,074
Please don't try these
stunts at home at all.

992
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,671
Rohit grew up in my garden only.

993
01:14:01,767 --> 01:14:04,077
I know him since he was a baby.

994
01:14:04,234 --> 01:14:07,772
And he has learnt all
his acting and dance from me.

995
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:09,905
Tell them, that he has grown up
playing with you..

996
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:12,413
Rohit and I used to play

997
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,912
the game of acting all the time.

998
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:56,040
"Look where have
my desires got me?"

999
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:05,581
"What am I doing alone?"

1000
01:15:08,267 --> 01:15:17,017
"My mind,
What's wrong with You."

1001
01:15:18,134 --> 01:15:26,485
"You don't know what
to do in helplessness."

1002
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:31,476
"Oh My illusory mind."

1003
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:36,612
"What have you done to me?"

1004
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:41,109
"Oh My illusory mind."

1005
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:47,273
"What have you done to me?"

1006
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:52,312
"Someone pulls a thread
Towards the dreams."

1007
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:56,276
"It doesn't listen to anyone."

1008
01:15:56,334 --> 01:16:00,407
"Oh My illusory mind."

1009
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:06,715
"What have you done to me?"

1010
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,177
"Change your destiny yourself."

1011
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:35,274
"Follow the path
of liberation yourself."

1012
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,346
"Your dreams won't
be left unfulfilled."

1013
01:16:40,867 --> 01:16:44,713
"Even your wishes
will be granted now."

1014
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:55,246
"You will be now tied
to the cycle of birth and death."

1015
01:16:55,434 --> 01:17:04,013
"The bird of life will
again come back to this earth."

1016
01:17:04,101 --> 01:17:08,208
"Oh My illusory mind."

1017
01:17:09,134 --> 01:17:13,810
"What have you done to me?"

1018
01:17:13,867 --> 01:17:18,009
"Oh My illusory mind."

1019
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:24,046
"What have you done to me?"

1020
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:50,474
"My breathes dance in my heart."

1021
01:17:53,767 --> 01:18:00,048
"I fully enjoy life now."

1022
01:18:03,234 --> 01:18:08,013
"I have to touch the stars."

1023
01:18:08,067 --> 01:18:12,948
"with the wings of desire."

1024
01:18:13,034 --> 01:18:16,641
"and fly away."

1025
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:21,149
"Oh My illusory mind."

1026
01:18:21,867 --> 01:18:26,407
"What have you done to me?"

1027
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:30,642
"Oh My illusory mind."

1028
01:18:31,301 --> 01:18:36,649
"What have you done to me?"

1029
01:18:56,501 --> 01:19:01,314
"when the life unfolds mystically."

1030
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:05,907
"Even the tears shine like pearls."

1031
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,915
"The moments we look for,
Come on their own."

1032
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:15,810
"Even dried up branches
shower petals."

1033
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:20,577
"What are these new
bouquets of happiness?"

1034
01:19:20,634 --> 01:19:25,413
"The blush on my cheeks,
Is it colour or emotions."

1035
01:19:25,467 --> 01:19:29,108
"Why does it happen like this?"

1036
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,610
"Oh My illusory mind."

1037
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,912
"What have you done to me?"

1038
01:19:39,134 --> 01:19:43,207
"Oh My illusory mind."

1039
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:49,441
"What have you done to me?"

1040
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:54,580
"Someone pulls a thread
towards the dreams."

1041
01:19:54,734 --> 01:19:58,580
"It doesn't listen to anyone."

1042
01:19:58,634 --> 01:20:02,776
"Oh My illusory mind."

1043
01:20:03,634 --> 01:20:07,980
"What have you done to me?"

1044
01:20:08,234 --> 01:20:12,410
"Oh My illusory mind."

1045
01:20:13,134 --> 01:20:19,141
"What have you done to me?"

1046
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:31,051
"Oh My illusory mind."

1047
01:20:32,067 --> 01:20:36,072
Vishnu.
- Hmm. - Our First phase is ..

1048
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,341
...almost over.

1049
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,107
Now you have to start
your final phase.

1050
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:46,738
I am ready, Guruji.

1051
01:20:47,834 --> 01:20:52,510
Just tell me, what should I do?

1052
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:56,739
Now you have to get
rid of all your attachments.

1053
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,879
...and live with
your desired conscious mind.

1054
01:21:01,634 --> 01:21:03,614
Which is..
- Bollywood.

1055
01:21:04,934 --> 01:21:07,972
Vishnu, Bollywood is very big.

1056
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:10,105
Guruji,

1057
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:17,417
I want to be born in the
family of a Bollywood star.

1058
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:19,806
There are so many
stars in Bollywood.

1059
01:21:21,134 --> 01:21:24,479
Tell me your specific target?

1060
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:32,944
Lata.. - Hmm.
- We didn't think about this.

1061
01:21:41,234 --> 01:21:43,680
Hrithik?
- Huh?

1062
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:46,377
Hrithik

1063
01:21:48,267 --> 01:21:49,769
Shahrukh?

1064
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,111
Both have kids, Vishnu.

1065
01:21:52,767 --> 01:21:55,611
Hrithik has two and
Shahrukh has three.

1066
01:21:57,967 --> 01:22:00,971
Akshay ?
- Two.

1067
01:22:05,134 --> 01:22:09,139
Salman.
- Salman is not married, Vishnu.

1068
01:22:37,934 --> 01:22:43,282
Chant this mantra..
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1069
01:22:45,967 --> 01:22:52,350
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1070
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:59,816
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1071
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:07,010
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1072
01:23:08,234 --> 01:23:13,274
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1073
01:23:14,434 --> 01:23:18,610
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1074
01:23:19,434 --> 01:23:24,076
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1075
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:29,877
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1076
01:23:29,934 --> 01:23:34,542
Please arrange his room
as per his desired conscious mind.

1077
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:38,011
This will help him focus more.

1078
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,041
"Om Mumbai Bollywood ..

1079
01:23:42,334 --> 01:23:44,610
...Star Namah."

1080
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:51,674
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1081
01:23:52,634 --> 01:23:57,879
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1082
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:03,974
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1083
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:11,108
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1084
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:18,017
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1085
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:23,840
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1086
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:29,440
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1087
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:33,244
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1088
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:38,446
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1089
01:24:39,034 --> 01:24:42,743
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1090
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,846
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1091
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:51,006
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1092
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:54,980
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah."

1093
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:12,643
Imli, hope you won't forget
us after going to Bollywood.

1094
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,511
I don't know. Anything can happen.

1095
01:25:18,467 --> 01:25:24,110
Anyway they say that
Mumbai changes everyone.

1096
01:25:34,834 --> 01:25:35,835
Who are you?

1097
01:25:42,034 --> 01:25:43,570
Imli, come fast. Daman!

1098
01:25:43,634 --> 01:25:46,137
Daman? Where?
- On TV.

1099
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,372
This is a very different film.

1100
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:57,141
Imli is an untold
story of a prostitute..

1101
01:25:57,234 --> 01:25:59,407
...which has never been
seen on screen.

1102
01:25:59,634 --> 01:26:03,605
And interestingly it is both
realistic and commercial as well.

1103
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:07,442
Kyra ma'am, as Daman said,
are you equally excited?

1104
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,478
Of course I am.

1105
01:26:08,534 --> 01:26:10,946
You know it is one of
the most interesting scripts.

1106
01:26:11,034 --> 01:26:12,342
...that l have heard recently.

1107
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,141
When I read it I just loved it.

1108
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,010
Sir, you are a main stream
commercial film producer.

1109
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,340
So why have you chosen
this realistic film?

1110
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,538
- Cinema is changing.

1111
01:26:19,801 --> 01:26:21,803
Daman's script has that change.

1112
01:26:22,067 --> 01:26:24,206
This boy has written
an amazing script,

1113
01:26:24,467 --> 01:26:25,878
which touched my heart.

1114
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:27,969
And whatever touches
your heart is True cinema!

1115
01:26:28,034 --> 01:26:29,911
Sir, we heard that you wanted..

1116
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:33,972
...to cast a real
prostitute for this film.

1117
01:26:34,034 --> 01:26:36,605
Yes, I wanted to.

1118
01:26:36,667 --> 01:26:41,741
Since this is a realistic film
I wanted to cast a real life character.

1119
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:47,709
...who has lived that life.
But anyway...

1120
01:26:47,767 --> 01:26:50,805
You know there is a lot
of commercial equations, etc.

1121
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:57,249
And when Kyra's
name was added to this film..

1122
01:26:57,334 --> 01:26:58,608
...It became big.

1123
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,873
Because of Kyra,
the grandeur of the film

1124
01:27:00,934 --> 01:27:02,572
...has become larger than life.

1125
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,146
And I am very happy now.
- Kyra ma'am.

1126
01:27:04,201 --> 01:27:07,546
You know that I have done
many glamorous roles before.

1127
01:27:07,601 --> 01:27:09,945
But something like this
which is realistic cinema.

1128
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,707
I wanted to do
it since a long time.

1129
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,007
And when this was offered to me,
It was like.. wow.

1130
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,411
And not to mention,
I am a theater trained actor.

1131
01:27:16,467 --> 01:27:18,140
So I wanted to do a similar role.

1132
01:27:18,634 --> 01:27:20,910
Daman, we have heard
that you have done..

1133
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:22,378
...a lot of research for this film.

1134
01:27:22,467 --> 01:27:23,775
Yes, you are right.

1135
01:27:23,867 --> 01:27:27,974
Actually I didn't want
to write it in a confined room.

1136
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:31,071
That's why I went out.
I visited brothels.

1137
01:27:31,134 --> 01:27:33,580
I interacted with
a lot of prostitutes.

1138
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:34,737
I spoke to them,

1139
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,108
spent time with them.

1140
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:41,139
And I closely observed their lives,

1141
01:27:41,334 --> 01:27:42,972
which you will see on screen.

1142
01:27:43,334 --> 01:27:46,611
And there are various
interesting moments in their lives,

1143
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,373
Hopes, dreams & drama!

1144
01:27:48,434 --> 01:27:49,811
There are so many things.

1145
01:27:50,434 --> 01:27:52,038
He is a bastard !

1146
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,704
He will go to hell!

1147
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:34,845
"What is this procession?"

1148
01:28:34,934 --> 01:28:40,247
"What are these paths?"

1149
01:28:40,467 --> 01:28:50,013
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1150
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:55,300
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1151
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:20,151
"Peace is lost in the
search for happiness."

1152
01:29:20,567 --> 01:29:29,681
"My heart gets sad
Even with tiny step."

1153
01:29:30,334 --> 01:29:39,152
"I don't understand where to go."

1154
01:29:39,234 --> 01:29:48,951
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1155
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,244
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1156
01:29:53,334 --> 01:29:59,046
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1157
01:30:18,501 --> 01:30:23,382
"The words gets
scattered in my breath."

1158
01:30:23,434 --> 01:30:28,179
"My sad eyes speak in silence."

1159
01:30:28,301 --> 01:30:30,781
"My shadow is my companion."

1160
01:30:30,834 --> 01:30:33,280
"The traveler moves on."

1161
01:30:33,367 --> 01:30:38,043
"No one can see my agony now."

1162
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:47,320
"I don't understand where to go."

1163
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:57,651
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1164
01:30:57,734 --> 01:31:07,416
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1165
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,471
"There is no light."

1166
01:31:29,534 --> 01:31:32,105
"My desires are lost."

1167
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:36,775
"My world of dreams is broken."

1168
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:39,405
"There is no restlessness."

1169
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,980
"There is no sense of freedom."

1170
01:31:42,034 --> 01:31:47,143
"Even my eyes are not
waiting for anything now."

1171
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:56,352
"I don't understand where to go."

1172
01:31:56,401 --> 01:32:05,913
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1173
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:11,001
"The butterfly has sold all
her colors to fulfill her dreams."

1174
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,402
Here's your TRP boy.

1175
01:32:22,467 --> 01:32:26,005
Hi Rohit. - Hello, sir.
- All good? - Very good, sir.

1176
01:32:26,067 --> 01:32:30,812
Nice. - Rohit, you are looking very good.
- Thank you.

1177
01:32:30,867 --> 01:32:32,005
And you must be very happy too?

1178
01:32:32,067 --> 01:32:33,637
Now that you have
become so popular.

1179
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,838
You have so many fans.

1180
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,107
I have heard that your
videos have gone viral.

1181
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:38,875
Have the fans mobbed you or not?

1182
01:32:40,967 --> 01:32:45,245
What is there in the bag?
- Nothing sir. Don't worry.

1183
01:32:45,901 --> 01:32:47,278
No more blood.

1184
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,877
So you will perform
something new today.

1185
01:32:52,101 --> 01:32:53,079
Yes, sir.

1186
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:54,613
Good.
- Wonderful.

1187
01:32:54,701 --> 01:32:57,739
Start. Can't wait to see you.
- Start.

1188
01:33:01,234 --> 01:33:02,474
Hello.

1189
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:05,140
Is he carrying an
animal inside his bag,

1190
01:33:05,834 --> 01:33:08,440
with whom he will
do a romantic scene?

1191
01:33:08,534 --> 01:33:11,344
Please.
- You are too much, Mr. Hussein.

1192
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:20,644
Oh god.

1193
01:33:20,734 --> 01:33:22,077
What is he doing?

1194
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:26,640
Tribal dance.

1195
01:33:27,067 --> 01:33:30,981
You have come to enjoy
the show of my death.

1196
01:33:31,667 --> 01:33:34,978
You have come.
Now they will hang me.

1197
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:39,343
Your cowardice. Your impotency.

1198
01:33:39,734 --> 01:33:41,771
Will see the drama
of this country..

1199
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:46,079
With complete silence !

1200
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:49,705
I don't want to say anything.
I don't want to say anything.

1201
01:33:49,767 --> 01:33:52,179
I don't want to say anything.
I don't want to say anything.

1202
01:33:52,234 --> 01:33:56,205
You are habituated
to stay in darkness.

1203
01:33:56,267 --> 01:33:59,714
You are habituated
to slavery.

1204
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:04,408
Slavery. Slavery. Slavery.
Do it. Do it.

1205
01:34:04,467 --> 01:34:06,538
They brainwash you
in the name of religion

1206
01:34:06,634 --> 01:34:09,877
And you. You behead each other.
Behead each other.

1207
01:34:09,934 --> 01:34:13,507
Behead each other. Behead
each other. Behead each other.

1208
01:34:13,567 --> 01:34:17,105
Even God must be thinking...

1209
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:19,977
I made such a beautiful thing,
A human being

1210
01:34:20,034 --> 01:34:22,071
A human being..

1211
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:25,774
But now they have become animals.

1212
01:34:26,034 --> 01:34:26,842
Rot. Perish.

1213
01:34:26,934 --> 01:34:27,571
Die. Die

1214
01:34:27,634 --> 01:34:28,271
Die. Die.

1215
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:30,677
I don't want to say anything.
I don't want to say anything.

1216
01:34:30,767 --> 01:34:33,805
I don't want to say anything.
I don't want to say anything.

1217
01:34:33,867 --> 01:34:37,144
I don't want to live.
I don't want to live.

1218
01:34:37,234 --> 01:34:42,650
Come. Come.
Come on, hang me. Hang me.

1219
01:34:48,234 --> 01:34:49,304
Rohit!

1220
01:34:56,734 --> 01:35:00,580
Are you okay? - Yeah, I am okay.
- You sure? - Yeah.

1221
01:35:16,934 --> 01:35:18,242
What happened, sir?

1222
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:21,981
Didn't you like my performance?

1223
01:35:24,567 --> 01:35:27,047
No problem, sir.
I will do something else.

1224
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,738
I will do something else.

1225
01:35:30,534 --> 01:35:32,878
Love doesn't mean,
that you have express it.

1226
01:35:33,034 --> 01:35:34,536
Love is love even
without saying anything.

1227
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,908
Love is sacrifice.

1228
01:35:35,967 --> 01:35:37,640
Staying silent with
each other is also love.

1229
01:35:37,734 --> 01:35:39,304
Rohit. Rohit. Rohit.

1230
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,804
Rohit.

1231
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:50,276
You don't have the kind
of talent .. ..we are looking for.

1232
01:35:54,067 --> 01:35:58,607
I am sorry to say,
but you can't go to Mumbai.

1233
01:35:59,934 --> 01:36:03,108
But sir,
you only said that I am brilliant.

1234
01:36:04,367 --> 01:36:07,905
I have the zeal.
I have the passion.

1235
01:36:08,267 --> 01:36:09,644
You said so.

1236
01:36:09,701 --> 01:36:13,979
Rohit, I can understand
what you are feeling right now.

1237
01:36:14,567 --> 01:36:16,205
But you have to understand.

1238
01:36:16,567 --> 01:36:18,911
Passion is one thing
and talent is another.

1239
01:36:19,367 --> 01:36:21,210
We are judges.

1240
01:36:21,267 --> 01:36:25,215
We have to be fair.
We cannot take you to Mumbai.

1241
01:36:25,934 --> 01:36:28,642
Then why didn't you
say so in the first round?

1242
01:36:29,834 --> 01:36:31,507
Why did you encourage me?

1243
01:36:32,301 --> 01:36:35,282
Why did you bring me till here?
- Did we do something wrong?

1244
01:36:40,734 --> 01:36:42,577
We encouraged you
because it's not fair..

1245
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:45,443
...to judge someone
in just one round.

1246
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:48,479
We thought that there
might be an actor inside you..

1247
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:50,405
...which would shine through
in the second round.

1248
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,740
Please, sir.

1249
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,041
Rohit, we are extremely sorry.

1250
01:36:57,401 --> 01:36:59,005
But you can't go
further than this with us.

1251
01:36:59,067 --> 01:37:00,137
We are really sorry.

1252
01:37:00,201 --> 01:37:03,273
How will I face my family?

1253
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,911
How will I face my friends?

1254
01:37:07,767 --> 01:37:11,806
Please sir, don't do this. Please.
- Rohit.

1255
01:37:12,734 --> 01:37:17,046
Try to understand us.
You have passion..

1256
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:19,312
...but not Art.

1257
01:37:19,367 --> 01:37:22,780
I will get the Art in me.
I will get the Art in me.

1258
01:37:22,834 --> 01:37:25,781
You will get the Art.
This is too much, Rohit.

1259
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:28,841
Do you even know, what Art is?

1260
01:37:30,267 --> 01:37:33,111
It's a precious gift of God.
Not everyone can have it.

1261
01:37:34,267 --> 01:37:36,213
You don't even have
a bit of Art.

1262
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:38,907
Neither you are an actor,
nor can you be one, ever.

1263
01:37:40,334 --> 01:37:41,904
What do you think,
cutting your hand..

1264
01:37:42,001 --> 01:37:44,311
...or smashing a bottle
in your head makes you an actor?

1265
01:37:45,267 --> 01:37:49,181
And if you don't believe me
then ask anyone present here.

1266
01:37:49,634 --> 01:37:52,171
Even if one of them says that
you are an actor..

1267
01:37:52,267 --> 01:37:54,804
...or you can become an actor
then you can come to Mumbai.

1268
01:37:59,167 --> 01:38:00,840
Go on. Ask them.

1269
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,713
Ankit, make him wear the shirt.
- Yes, sir.

1270
01:38:48,367 --> 01:38:49,675
Rohit.

1271
01:39:28,134 --> 01:39:31,809
Rakesh, how could
you be so insensitive?

1272
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,574
There was no other way
to make him understand.

1273
01:39:34,634 --> 01:39:36,739
Disgusting. Disgusting.

1274
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:09,547
Rohit, do you want to talk?

1275
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,307
How was your final round? Rohit.

1276
01:40:12,167 --> 01:40:13,669
Rohit.

1277
01:41:18,134 --> 01:41:19,374
Brother!

1278
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:27,246
Rohit! Son, all this happens.
Don't lose hope.

1279
01:41:27,934 --> 01:41:29,140
Nothing will happen, my child.

1280
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:32,113
Everything will be fine.
Open the door please.

1281
01:41:32,501 --> 01:41:35,038
You wanted to act, right.
Look, what happened?

1282
01:41:36,067 --> 01:41:37,671
Everyone is laughing at you.

1283
01:41:38,867 --> 01:41:40,608
He wants to be an actor.

1284
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,404
Look at him!

1285
01:41:58,767 --> 01:42:00,542
He wants to be an actor.

1286
01:42:01,967 --> 01:42:04,971
Look at him!

1287
01:42:05,301 --> 01:42:08,510
He wants to be an actor.

1288
01:42:08,834 --> 01:42:11,508
You want to be a hero?

1289
01:42:34,801 --> 01:42:36,610
Look at him.

1290
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:59,507
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1291
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:06,413
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1292
01:43:07,867 --> 01:43:13,510
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1293
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:19,713
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1294
01:43:20,134 --> 01:43:25,982
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1295
01:43:26,967 --> 01:43:33,213
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1296
01:43:34,634 --> 01:43:39,105
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1297
01:43:39,601 --> 01:43:45,517
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1298
01:43:45,834 --> 01:43:51,341
"Om Mumbai Bollywood Star Namah!"

1299
01:45:56,201 --> 01:45:59,114
Rohit! Open the door.

1300
01:45:59,167 --> 01:46:03,377
Move aside, I will break the door.
Rohit! Open the door!

1301
01:46:07,534 --> 01:46:09,980
The blood which is not
shed for the country is water.

1302
01:46:10,034 --> 01:46:13,277
The youth which is not
used for the nation is useless.

1303
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:22,540
One foot is in the past,
other is in the future.

1304
01:46:22,634 --> 01:46:25,240
That's why we are
peeing on the present.

1305
01:46:25,734 --> 01:46:27,771
Your rules and your ideology.

1306
01:46:27,867 --> 01:46:31,246
Your rules and your ideology
cannot buy me a piece of bread!

1307
01:46:31,334 --> 01:46:33,473
I will set the world on fire.

1308
01:46:33,567 --> 01:46:36,241
The day you will get married
I will set the world on fire.

1309
01:46:36,301 --> 01:46:38,713
I am your father.
My name is Shahenshah, The King!!

1310
01:46:38,801 --> 01:46:39,973

Rohit. - Thank you.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, papa.

1321
01:47:02,534 --> 01:47:05,310
Thank you.
I won the best actor award, papa.

1322
01:47:05,367 --> 01:47:07,278
I have signed 3 films. 3 films.

1323
01:47:07,334 --> 01:47:10,213
Aditya Chopra asked me to
sign 3 films back to back.

1324
01:47:10,301 --> 01:47:13,510
3 films. 3 films together.
3 films together.

1325

I don't have time. I don't have time.

I don't have time. I don't have time.

1327
01:47:19,001 --> 01:47:21,481
Katrina is waiting for me.
Katrina is waiting.

1328
01:47:21,534 --> 01:47:22,842
Rohit.
- Katrina is waiting for me.

1329
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:25,278
My last film did
a business of 500 crores.

1330
01:47:25,334 --> 01:47:28,907
500 crores. My last film " Dhat Teri Ki"
has done a business of 500 crores.

1331
01:47:28,967 --> 01:47:31,174
I said no. I refused everyone.

1332
01:47:31,267 --> 01:47:33,338
I said no to Tushar Kapoor.

1333
01:47:33,434 --> 01:47:36,415
I said no to Ekta Kapoor.
I don't want to do television soaps.

1334
01:47:36,501 --> 01:47:38,105
I will do films. Only films.

1335
01:47:38,167 --> 01:47:40,044
Get away. I am giving my take.

1336
01:47:40,134 --> 01:47:42,740
I am giving my take.

1337
01:47:42,801 --> 01:47:45,042
Hello. Hello. I have a film shoot.
I have a film shoot.

1338
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:46,135
You are not letting me shoot.

1339
01:47:46,201 --> 01:47:47,976
Let me shoot.
Let me shoot. Let me shoot.

1340

Get out all of you.
They are waiting for me. - Rohit.

They are waiting for me. Mr. Amitabh
Bachchan is waiting for me.

1342
01:47:54,167 --> 01:47:57,046

1352
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:06,609
<i>Hello,</i> An/ind.

1353
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:13,314
It's a great news Man!!
Priyanka liked the script.

1354
01:49:14,334 --> 01:49:17,144
Tell our director
to finalize everything.
