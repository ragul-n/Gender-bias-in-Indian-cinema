00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:46,375
Next singer is Mohan Rao 
from Ambusoli .

174
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,625
"Dear son-in-law do you want me to 
cook sweet dish or hot dish for you ?"

175
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,667
"Dear son-in-law do you want me to 
cook sweet dish or hot dish for you ?"

176
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:04,792
"Hot dish tastes delicious and 
sweet dish taste awesome...."

177
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:09,750
"Hot dish tastes delicious and 
sweet dish taste awesome...."

178
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,375
"Dear son-in-law should i 
make you chicken or mutton?"

179
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:15,417
"Dear son-in-law should i 
make you chicken or mutton?"

180
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,375
*Cheers& Applauds*

181
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,292
Sir wait...Why are you giving him marks? 
First, second and

182
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,042
third places are to be given 
only for the wealthy kids.

183
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,875
What is the need to conduct 
the competition then?

184
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,917
Don't you know he is from 
the untouchable community?

185
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,667
So what Madam? I am also 
from that community.

186
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:34,542
That was the day we realised not 
just our community but our song is also

187
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,792
untouchable ...Mohan rao wasn't 
given the prize that day.

188
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't get disheartened for 
losing dear....You sang well amongst all.

189
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,167
wait a second..

190
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,583
You deserve the first prize.

191
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,458
Just because of coming from a lower caste, 
you will not win...don't stop singing.

192
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,833
Music and dance are in our lives...

193
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,417
It's in our blood..

194
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,167
Our songs are required only for

195
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,542
Churches, gatherings, 
Birth and Death.

196
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,542
- sir... 
- yes

197
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:12,042
When he sang so well, why is 
not given the first Prize ?

198
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:15,875
The way people were cheering when 
he was singing, is the biggest prize.

199
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,208
The same day when Mohan 
rao took the insult

200
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,833
to his heart, something else 
happened the same evening.

201
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,667
We couldn't take water 
from our well because

202
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,917
of the dead body found 
in it, so we all

203
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,292
went to the well where 
the higher caste kids

204
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,625
took a bath..to get 
some water for drinking.

205
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,833
That was the day when Peddha 
Shaavukaru heard about Mohan rao.

206
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:37,917
(omnious music)

207
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,708
What is the matter ? All of you 
are carrying buckets here ?

208
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,333
We found a dead body in 
our community well...

209
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,333
we don't have water for 
drinking , after you finish

210
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,083
bathing we will 
take few buckets of water.

211
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,250
You want to take water 
from this well ? All the

212
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,417
water will become untouchable 
once you touch them.

213
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:59,583
How will the water become 
untouchable sir? We have

214
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,292
kids at home and no water 
to atleast cook food.

215
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,625
Stop eating food ...if we allow you 
now, you would get habituated and

216
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,667
soon after we have to 
take bath in these

217
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,833
water which you have 
touched and pissed in.

218
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,375
When we work in your factories and in 
your crops, why did you forget we are

219
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,625
untouchables? I know how many 
untouchable women you have slept with.

220
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:22,500
Stop talking you and 
get the fuck out of here.

221
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,375
Is that the way you talk to women sir ? 
isn't it wrong ?

222
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,792
Dont you dare tell me what is 
right and what is wrong..you bastard.

223
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,208
Uncle....

224
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,042
(suspenseful music)

225
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,208
Mohanrao had beaten 
the shit out of Naidu's son that day.

226
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:41,125
Mohan Rao listen to 
me...don't fight him...

227
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,167
you don't know dad....

228
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,625
Don't hit him Mohan rao...don't do it

229
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,125
- leave him... 
- get away from me

230
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,250
(pushes him)

231
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,000
-He deserves it. 
- But he is from higher caste.

232
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:58,167
From today on, this well belongs 
to us....Tell this to your

233
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,958
father. If anyone opposes this 
i will kill them you bastards.

234
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,767
How dare those untouchable 
who stay

235
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,808
in outskirts of our village 
hit my son for our water ?

236
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:09,933
I got to know they work for you.

237
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:12,475
(Ominous music plays)

238
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:14,392
Whatever happened has happened..

239
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,058
Don't make a scene out of this.

240
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,183
If i talk to them about this,

241
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,183
my business would be affected.

242
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:23,142
I will tell my people to dig 
a new water well ..you can leave now.

243
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:24,100
Take care of your son.

244
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,267
(birds chirping) 
(suspenseful music)

245
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:28,475
Take care of your son.

246
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:30,892
Listen Naidu...

247
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:34,975
I am telling you guys 
again...don't make

248
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:38,142
this an issue. I know 
when and how to react,

249
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:39,350
get it ?

250
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:42,600
(water splashes)

251
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,808
Why did you talk to them like that , Dad ?

252
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:50,683
If we leave them like that, someday 
they will start attacking us too

253
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:51,683
(ominous music)

254
00:18:56,392 --> 00:19:01,600
(dog barks)Stop barking...If hungry, this 
will not wait a second till i give it food

255
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,183
(Dog barks) 
(Suspenseful music)

256
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:19,683
Just because your mom is feeding 
the dog doesn't mean it is equal to us

257
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:24,683
It's job is to safeguard us 
and our duty is to feed it

258
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,558
Beauty of power is knowing 
how and where to use it,

259
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,308
you shouldn't be using it, just 
because you have it.

260
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:42,225
Now they will start using 
that water from that well...

261
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,517
Now the workers will work much 
harder thinking their boss did

262
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,183
not say anything inspite of 
them doing this grave mistake

263
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:55,642
We will get a new well dug 
up, seeing this Palasa

264
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:58,642
people will think i 
am such a nice person.

265
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:01,642
This is being smart.

266
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:06,350
Always remember we are from 
a community who makes a

267
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:11,183
mess and they are from a 
community who clears...

268
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:14,975
(birds chirping)

269
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:18,267
(ominous music)

270
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,975
If my brother comes to 
know that i am coming here

271
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:25,183
everyday at this time, he 
will start suspecting me.

272
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:36,100
Your brother is just jealous that i 
keep getting more programs than him.

273
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,600
If you weren't there, 
he wouldn't be fit to

274
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,975
sing atleast at bhajans 
or in any gatherings.

275
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:43,308
(scoffs)

276
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,225
You wouldn't sleep without criticising 
my brother atleast once in a day.

277
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:48,308
(romantic music)

278
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,433
Do we just keep talking always or....

279
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,892
....can't we do something else?

280
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:58,308
♫♫

281
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:21,642
We would help Mohan rao and Lakshmi 
to meet everynight ,

282
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:25,558
while they were busy romancing i used 
to try my chance with Kanakamma.

283
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,225
I liked her a lot...

284
00:21:27,225 --> 00:21:29,142
I don't know how but 
lakshmi's brother Muthyalu

285
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:32,350
got suspicious about her 
affair with Mohan rao.

286
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,642
sit down...you don't need to give 
me respect in that situation too

287
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,642
sit down

288
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:43,517
You idiot....why are you roaming where 
women come to attend nature's call?

289
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:45,683
Did you see his sister 
and Jaggamma around ?

290
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:48,558
Did he come here to wipe her ass ? 
Can't she do it by herself ?

291
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,600
come, lets move from here...If 
we stay here for a minute

292
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,558
they might throw away 
those dirty water on us

293
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Be careful, there are 
snakes around everywhere

294
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,767
Mutyalu, now a days i don't 
hear you guys singing....

295
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:02,767
All i hear 
is Mohan Rao singing.

296
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:06,933
We are singing around orissa.

297
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:09,308
We have a very good name 
in Orissa now a days

298
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,433
Stop giving yourself fake credit,

299
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:14,183
i always see you either sitting 
here or near that shop.

300
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:18,392
Fact is Mohan rao is a very 
good singer than you .

301
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:20,225
He creates a magic when he sings.

302
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,475
(sarcastic laugh)

303
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:23,892
He creates magic when 
he does something else.

304
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,767
can he sing like my sister ?

305
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:27,892
They are coming only to see 
Gaajula Gowri dancing around...

306
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:30,892
otherwise no one would go 
to watch brothers perform.

307
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,142
They are coming...today i 
will teach them a lesson.

308
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,392
(folk song playing)

309
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,808
- lakshmi 
- yeah

310
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,100
we are going towards the lake, 
do you want to join us ?

311
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,017
yes, i will join you

312
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:48,183
Hey...come here

313
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:49,850
(tense music)

314
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,433
Why do you need my sister to 
accompany you for nature's call ??

315
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,933
We thought maybe ..she 
also wanted to go ...

316
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,475
she will go if she wants to...you go ahead

317
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,600
*sings*

318
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,142
(Humming)

319
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:12,433
Are you going to 
attend nature's call ?

320
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,183
yes brother

321
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:17,433
Why are you getting ready 
to attend nature's call ?

322
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,892
You don't even bother to get ready 
when we are performing.

323
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:22,850
I am just going to accompany Jaggamma...

324
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:25,475
How come all three of you want 
to attend nature's call at same

325
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:28,308
time....of all Mohan rao and Dandaasi 
also attend the call at same time.

326
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:35,433
You think i can't see what's happening? 
Dont make me kill you both.

327
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,933
(crickets chirping)

328
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:40,808
Mohan rao, i can see 
my girl coming but

329
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,600
not your's....what do you 
think has happened ?

330
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:46,267
why are you walking like a 
catwalk model Kanaka?

331
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,392
Her brother got to know about you guys.

332
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,308
She will not come from now 
on.....infact neither of us will come.

333
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,808
(Splashes water)

334
00:23:56,683 --> 00:24:00,683
What shall we do now, Mohan rao ?

335
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,475
If my aunt would have been alive, i 
would have got married to her by now.

336
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:07,600
Let's go and knock the door directly

took away the head

How are you related to Mohan Rao ?

00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,058
I am his sister-in-law

357
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,392
If you are hiding the truth , 
you will get into trouble later

358
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,683

you or if you see him

Greetings Sir!!

369
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:42,558
I am Satyanarayana, retired head constable

370
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:44,475
I got to know you wanted to meet me

371
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:45,933
- please sit 
- okay

372
00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:53,350
It's just a week since i joined, i 
haven't settled down yet and...

373
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:57,058
Last night MLA Candidate 
Ganapavaasi has been murdered.

374
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,975
It's rumoured that old criminal 
Mohan Rao has killed him.

375
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,142
I heard you were working here at 
that time...i want some information.

376
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:06,392
Do you know those people who just left ?

377
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:07,350
i know them sir

378
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,100
She is Gauri, when she was young all 
the upper caste men used to eye her.

379
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:17,517
That guy's name is 
Dandaasi, he used to work

380
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:20,600
at the cashew factory 
and also play drums.

381
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,225
Can you tell me about Mohan 
rao and his family ?

382
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:28,725
I know Mohan rao, his brother Ranga 
rao and his father Sundar rao .

383
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:32,142
I was the one who took up 
Mohan rao's first case.

384
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:37,017
Our SI Kondal rao left him 
without filing a case..

385
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,975
(phone rings)

386
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,392
...that was a small fight.

387
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,683
(phone ringing)

388
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,558
That was the first time i saw him

389
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:52,725
Why did you hit these guys ?

390
00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:54,725
When we were playing run 
and catch, these guys

391
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,350
came and said they 
wanted to play cricket

392
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,767
We requested them to wait for few 
minutes as were playing the last game

393
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:02,017
This guy Aachari, threw away 
all our belongings and abused

394
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:05,142
us saying what are lower caste 
guys doing in this ground ?

395
00:27:05,142 --> 00:27:07,267
We got frustated and hit them Sir

396
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:09,683
Aren't you ashamed to play run 
and catch being an adult ? You

397
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,808
guys will become normal when 
i give you police treatment

398
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,517
Sorry sir, we did a 
mistake...but they abused our

399
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:16,975
mothers and sisters too, 
so we raised our hands

400
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:22,183
Satyanarayana, lock them up for 2 days and 
make sure they don't get food or water

401
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,850
Sir, sir..please leave us...we have to 
perform at Jagannadh temple in the evening

402
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,558
Yes sir, they are Poet Sundar 
rao's sons..very good singers

403
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:33,350
Sir, please leave us 
sir....it was a mistake sir

404
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:34,225

405
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:36,058
Okay ! you guys can leave now

406
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,975
So what kind of songs do you guys sing ?

407
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,517
We sing our Srikakulam songs sir, very 
energetic songs written by our elders

408
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:48,725
Okay then, sing a song for me...if 
you sing well, i will leave you guys

409

One more time you call us sisters..i 
will not even respond to you

become daughter-in-laws 
to the same house

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,100
I will never step into 
the house where you live

456

Did you forget roaming all around 
the village and romancing him ?

Her foolish brother, who 
works as a right hand for

458
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,308
peddha shaavukaaru might have told 
her to stay away from me

Anyway , this dear sister is very 
obedient to her brother, isn't it?

460
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:04,475
Man proposes and god disposes is what 
happened in Mohan rao's case this year

461
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:07,433
Peddha Shaavukaru got scared of Naxals,

462
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:09,933
left his Liquor business and 
got into movie hall business

463
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:12,642
They opened the movie hall 
with the movie Bobbili puli

464
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:14,767
That was the time when actor 
N.T.Rama rao established his

465
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:17,100
political party and has been 
campaigning in every village

466
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:22,725
This was the same time when 
Mohan rao and Ranga rao

467
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,058
became murderers and 
Bhairagi heard about them

468
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:27,683

469
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:31,975
-I could get one ticket ..how about you ? 
-I got one too

470
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:35,725
How many did you get ?

471
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:36,725
What is this ?

472
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,850
They gave only 3 tickets

473
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,850
- oh no..just 3 tickets ? 
- how will they come ?

474
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:42,767

Are you Ambusoli Gauri ?

478
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,558
You are the one called as 
Gajula Gauri, isn't it ?

479
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:58,850
Yes sir, i work as a labour in 
your uncle's Cashew factory

480
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:00,558
What's the matter ?

481
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:03,808
We are four , when we stand for 
tickets in that line we are getting

482
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,517
squeezed by the crowd..can you 
give us four tickets please ?

483
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:11,600
You look so nice , i feel like 
...i will give you the tickets

484
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,683
for free...what will 
you give me in return?

485
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,433
We don't need it for free 
sir, we will pay you for that

486
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:22,267
There is a room inside...will you 
come there after watching the movie ?

487
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:23,850

488
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,058

00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:28,100
Answer me, will you come ?

490
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:32,683

492
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:36,767
What happened ?

493
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,725
Nothing...

494
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:41,892
I asked him to help with the 
tickets and he is talking rubbish

495
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,808
He is asking to come to the 
room if we want tickets

496
00:34:43,808 --> 00:34:46,642
He is asking Gauri to sleep with him

497
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:52,933
Sir, is that the way you speak to women ?

498
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:55,642
Lower caste women aren't prostitues..

499
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:59,058
How come you can sleep with 
an untouchable women ?

500
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
You untouchable.... 
(slaps)

501
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:09,058
All your women are born to sleep with

Here take this...

505
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,183
I expected you to come and hit him

506
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:33,892
These are our community women...

507
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:34,975
Don't you know how much i like Gauri?

508
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:37,683
I did not expect this from you...

509
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:39,975
Didn't you see how we got insulted ?

514
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:56,933
people should start talking 
about how badly have we hit him..

515
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:58,892
He shouldn't be in a position to wake up

Mohan rao did not forget how his brother 
and sister-in-law were insulted

518
00:36:09,892 --> 00:36:13,517
The same day when N.T.Rama rao 
campaigned in Palasa, both the

519
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:16,933
brothers attacked Tarakesh with 
the sticks used in campaign

520
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:19,142

521
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,933
What do you want ?

522
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:24,933

523
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,142

524
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:28,392
get away ....

525
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:30,433
Break his leg first

526
00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:31,475
Don't you know how to talk to women...

528
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,767
leave him...he might die

529
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,767
You Bastard, you think lower 
caste people are not humans...

530
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,225
let me break your bones

531
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,225
Ranga it's enough..leave him..

532
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,975
let's leave now

533
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:54,558

535
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:00,892
Bloody asshole.....

536
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,642
enough...let's go now

537
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,725
Peddha Shaavukaaru got to know people 
from Ambusoli , who were afraid

538
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:15,683
to enter his compound , attacked his son 
and hit him badly..this infuriated him

539
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:19,642
He sent a word to Bhairagi

540
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,725
Will he survive or not ?

541
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:28,308
It will take time for him to recover 
from injuries and walk normally

542
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:33,392
Nothing major but send 
him to Vizag, he needs

543
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:34,475
- physiotheraphy 
- * weeping *

544
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:35,808
*loud wails *

545
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:44,725
Who did this and how many were there ?

546
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:49,183
They are from your Ambusoli 
village....you keep quiet

547
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:54,600
They had a fight about tickets 
near the Movie hall

548
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:58,392
other day itseems....they broke 
my son's hands and legs

549
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,850
*cries*

550
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:03,600
If people come to know that 
Peddha Shaavukaaru's son has been

551
00:38:03,642 --> 00:38:05,350
attacked, they will not 
be afraid of us anymore

552
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:08,058
The only way to fill 
fear in Palasa people

553
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,600
is to attack them 
both....break their legs

554
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:12,442
On that note, my dear people....

555
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,067

to be narrated by the

674
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,150
(tense music)

675
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:45,442
Mohana....

676
00:50:52,192 --> 00:50:57,692
When you can lift Bharagi stone....don't 
you think you can lift him too ?

678

(screams)

679
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:50,650
See this...this is your 
stone...Bhairagi's stone

680
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:56,775
There is no more Bhairagi in Palasa.

681
00:52:57,025 --> 00:52:59,942
Palasa will have only Mohan Rao. 
(shouts)

682
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:08,483
Go and tell your Landlord

683
00:53:09,108 --> 00:53:11,317
Bhairagi is dead

684
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,400
If he tries to get me or my brother....

685
00:53:16,108 --> 00:53:19,900
tell him, i will kill him too

686

♫♫

687
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:29,942
With Bhairagi's death, Peddha 
Shaavukaru lost his power...

688
00:53:30,108 --> 00:53:33,400
Mohan rao and Ranga rao went to 
police station and surrendered

689
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:39,067
That is when Chinna Shaavukaaru 
understood how to bring his brother down

690
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:49,775
They work for me.....Because of some 
old grudge they killed Bhairagi...

691
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,733
Whatever it might be, murder is a murder..

692
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:57,108
I scolded them and brought them 
here saying it was a mistake...

693
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,150
Register it as an accident 
and close the case

694
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:03,108
Sundar rao's sons came and surrendered 
saying they killed Bhairagi...

695
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,442
(scoffs)

696
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,067
I am competing for coperative 
president this time...

697
00:54:13,608 --> 00:54:17,275
KaruNaidu will be the 
MLA candidate....i need men

698
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:18,983
...there is so much 
of work to handle..

699
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:23,608
If i win , we both need each other

700
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:24,983
(suspenseful music)

701
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,983
Out of gratitude Mohan 
rao and Ranga rao

702
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:44,108
started working for 
Gurumurthy who bailed them

703
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,317
It was election's time

704
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:49,025
Gurumurthy visited every 
house for campaigning

705
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:51,900
Every polling booth was taken 
care by Mohan and Ranga

706
00:54:52,025 --> 00:54:54,442
Gurumurthy became co-operative president

707
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:57,900
KaruNaidu who left Peddha Shaavukaru 
joined Gurumurthy and became MLA

708
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:01,733
Namaste Sir.

709
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:03,525
Sit down

710
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:05,275

711
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:07,525

Do you have any objections ?

715
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:24,567
When you and your brother 
are funding for your

716
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,317
respective parties, why would 
we have any objection ?

Padma has been with me...

I should do something for her

729

Sir....

730
00:56:12,108 --> 00:56:14,900
Don't worry Padma will take 
care of your Panchayat

731
00:56:15,317 --> 00:56:18,567
That's not the matter sir...Me and my 
brother know those villages very well...So

732
00:56:18,817 --> 00:56:21,442
it would be nice if either one of 
us will contest from those villages

733
00:56:21,608 --> 00:56:24,733
What the hell Ranga rao, don't 
you know what to speak ?

734
00:56:25,233 --> 00:56:27,858
You and your brother already 
started eyeing on Politics,is it ?

735
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,192
How long do you want us to be 
like this Lawyer Sir ? We used

736
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:32,942
to stick posters for your 
campaigns...you became MLA too

737
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:34,608
We too have dreams sir

738
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,608
You thought just by killing Bhairagi, 
you could get into politics ?

739
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,108
What did you guys achieve ?

740
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:41,817
Just because of your 
brother's support, you

741
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:43,317
are able to stand 
infront of us like this

742
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,233
Calm down

743
00:56:45,983 --> 00:56:50,817
Listen Ranga....we all need to talk 
something, you go out and wait

744
00:56:50,817 --> 00:56:53,442
Sir, this lawyer was with your brother...

745
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,567
You gained popularity after 
we joined you ...this

746
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:57,692
guy came to you after 
us and became MLA too

747
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,567
When you have future plans 
for your mistress...

748
00:57:01,608 --> 00:57:03,025
...why can't you 
do something for us ?

749
00:57:03,317 --> 00:57:05,317
How dare you ?

750
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:10,525
If it wasn't for me..you and your 
brother would have been rotting in jail

751
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:13,067
You think you did a favour to us ? 
Din't we help you out ?

752
00:57:13,317 --> 00:57:14,900
We made this lawyer win twice in elections

753
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:17,650
Did you forget what all 
we brothers did for you ?

754
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:20,067
We killed people for you...

755
00:57:20,483 --> 00:57:21,400
we did rigging...

756
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,067
Are we not humans or 
don't we have dreams ?

757
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,317
How dare you talk to me like this ??

758
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:29,025
You untouchable idiot.....how dare you ??

759
00:57:30,608 --> 00:57:32,233
Who the hell are you ?

760
00:57:32,275 --> 00:57:33,942
Asshole..you should be standing 
outside of our house...

761
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,858
allowing you inside the house was 
more than enough...get out of here

762
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,025
I will get you arrested by evening

763
00:57:40,233 --> 00:57:41,233
(ominous music)

764
00:57:48,108 --> 00:57:49,900
Okay, let's see.....

765
00:57:50,525 --> 00:57:54,025
I will contest in elections this 
time.....from Ambusoli village

766
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:56,192
Stop me if you can.

767
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,359
*panting*

768
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:36,775
Did you fight with Shaavukaaru?

769
00:58:40,775 --> 00:58:42,442
What happened ?

770
00:58:43,484 --> 00:58:46,067
What is the necessity for him 
to get into politics now?

771
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:48,984
Do you think Shaavukaaru will keep quiet 
after the way you spoke to him ?

772
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,400
He will get you arrested.

773
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,525
Why are you quiet ? Answer me.

774
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:56,942
If we get arrested...Shaavukaaru 
also will be arrested.

775
00:58:58,109 --> 00:59:00,734
Answer to my question first...

776
00:59:01,817 --> 00:59:04,234
Go and beg him to forgive you.

777
00:59:04,525 --> 00:59:06,734
How many times should we 
keep begging people ?

778
00:59:06,984 --> 00:59:09,484
I spoke to him so that we can 
stop depending on people.

779
00:59:09,734 --> 00:59:11,025
Why shouldn't we get into politics or

780
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:13,400
shouldn't we win the elections ?

781
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,817
Did you forget that we are just rowdies ?

782
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,400
We are artists...not rowdies.

783
00:59:22,484 --> 00:59:24,317
We became rowdies for them.

784
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:26,859
They became leaders with our help.

785
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:30,859
You have become oversmart....Let 
us go and ask him to forgive us.

786
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,817
get up...

787
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,400
I know what to do..you 
just leave me alone.

788
00:59:38,484 --> 00:59:41,275
Stop acting crazy and let's go.

789
00:59:41,317 --> 00:59:43,525
What the hell is your problem ?

790
00:59:43,525 --> 00:59:45,650
Mohan rao..Ranga..stop..

791
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:46,734
Mohan rao..Ranga...

792
00:59:46,775 --> 00:59:50,150
Mohan rao...Rangaaaa... 
*slaps*

793
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:55,109
* women sobs *

794
00:59:57,859 --> 01:00:00,359
What the hell did i do ?

795
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:04,234
We are scared of our lives every second.

796
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:06,484
I asked him so that we could 
stop all this and settle down in life

797
01:00:06,484 --> 01:00:08,775
by getting married and having 
kids..i want to have peace.

798
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:13,567
I didn't ask only for myself...i 
want him to be happy too.

799
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:17,942
.......

800
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:20,900
Be with that landlord.

801
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,359
You raised your hand on me, isn't it? 
You just wait and watch.

802
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,525
Don't go Ranga...Ranga....

803
01:00:27,567 --> 01:00:30,484
*sobs*

804
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:35,650
I will take care of it...you may leave.

805
01:00:38,775 --> 01:00:40,067
Namaste Sir.

806
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:45,484
He fought with his brother, so ..we 
came to talk to you about it.

807
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:46,900
sit down.

808
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,775
I wanted to get these 
brothers killed by hiring

809
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:58,109
men from Kolkata, 
when they killed Bhairagi.

810
01:00:59,317 --> 01:01:01,025
They made my son physically handicapped,

811
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:04,734
I accept what he did was not correct..he 
shouldn't have spoken to women like that.

812
01:01:05,192 --> 01:01:08,609
Bhairagi is a closed chapter.

813
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:15,525
Muthyalu has been working for us since 
his childhood...i can't say no to him.

814
01:01:15,817 --> 01:01:20,984
You are the right candidate to 
represent our party from Ambusoli.

815
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:23,192
Am sure you will win.

816
01:01:24,609 --> 01:01:30,109
You should do rigging, tampering and all 
but don't get your relationships in these.

817
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:31,109
Understood ?

818
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:34,942
Though you left my 
brother's group...he will not leave you.

819
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:39,275
No sir..i will not let my 
relationships come inbetween.

820
01:01:39,317 --> 01:01:43,234
It doesn't look genuine if brothers 
representing different parties are

821
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:47,525
staying in same house...leave that 
house and stay in my Cashew farms.

822
01:01:49,484 --> 01:01:51,900
No sir...his father will 
not allow him to do this.

823
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:54,734
Whatever differences they might 
have ..both brothers should be

824
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:57,984
staying in the same house...his 
father is very adamant about this.

825
01:01:59,775 --> 01:02:01,567
All they have left is their father.

826
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:06,025
Politics is not a joke.... 
Nothing should go wrong.

827
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,359
I should regain my popularity.

828
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,817
When my brother comes to 
know that you have stepped

829
01:02:10,817 --> 01:02:13,317
into my house, he should 
be scared for his life

830
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:18,067
I will be there to support you...

831
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:23,567
Will you make me proud ?? 
tell me..can you do it ?

832
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:26,942
Yes sir...i will do 
whatever you want me to do.

833
01:02:33,567 --> 01:02:38,150
You want to get those jerks 
who made my only son

834
01:02:38,192 --> 01:02:43,484
bound to wheel chair and 
keep them in this house ??

835
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,275
Me and my brother 
worked as street vendors

836
01:02:50,317 --> 01:02:54,817
selling sweets in this village.

837
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:59,192
My father once told us...he who can 
sell sweet to a diabetic patient,

838
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:02,525
is the one who has 
succeeded in his business.

839
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:06,984
Labours work hard in our crops 
but it is we who enjoy the yield

840
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:11,525
..they get peanuts for the hardwork 
but we get paid by doing nothing.

841
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:16,859
Just because we have a knife in the 
house we can't go around killing

842
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:21,275
our enemies...we have to find 
someone who can do it for us.

843
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,775
All you have to do to get your work 
done is, throw some treats at them...

844
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:33,775
Once the work is done you have 
to retreat him..understood ?

845
01:03:34,317 --> 01:03:38,525
I will make sure these brothers 
and my brother kill each other .

846
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:41,900
Once they are dead i will 
make my son rule this place.

847
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:44,984
Pedda Shaavukaaru lived up to his 
word by supporting Ranga rao

848
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:48,400
in opposing Mohan rao and 
Gurumurthy in Panchayat elections.

849
01:03:54,734 --> 01:03:56,817
However Ranga rao couldn't 
withstand power and money of Mohan rao

850
01:03:56,817 --> 01:03:58,817
and Gurumurthy which resulted 
in him losing the elections.

851
01:03:58,817 --> 01:04:01,525
Just because Pedda Shaavukaaru 
helped him in his low

852
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:04,442
times..Ranga rao stayed back 
with him out of gratitude.

853
01:04:05,317 --> 01:04:07,150
Muthyalu and Ranga rao 
used to take care of

854
01:04:07,192 --> 01:04:09,609
all the businesses owned 
by Pedda Shaavukaaru.

855
01:04:09,775 --> 01:04:11,192
The day Tekkali Padma won the elections

856
01:04:11,234 --> 01:04:14,109
...Mohan rao and 
Lakshmi got married.

857
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:26,275
Can you get up once ?

858
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:28,817
Where did you come from ?

859
01:04:28,942 --> 01:04:30,359
Why did you come here ? Who 
asked you to come here ?

860
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:32,859
One more time you ask me this 
question..i will hit you hard.

861
01:04:34,025 --> 01:04:34,942
Which village ?

862
01:04:34,984 --> 01:04:36,400
Harishchandra puram,

863
01:04:36,484 --> 01:04:41,609
it's little far away from here...you might 
not have heard about me...I am Mohan rao.

864
01:04:42,775 --> 01:04:47,275
The day she was born, our parents 
decided to get us married to each other.

865
01:04:48,609 --> 01:04:51,775
Had my aunt been alive...we 
would have had 2 kids by now.

866
01:04:51,817 --> 01:04:56,317
Don't you know how we roamed around the 
village and how much we love each other?

867
01:04:57,275 --> 01:04:59,442
Brother, please don't 
mind but it's just that

868
01:04:59,442 --> 01:05:01,775
we did not get married 
officially....

869
01:05:01,817 --> 01:05:05,609
we are no less that wife and husband..try 
to understand what am i saying.

870
01:05:05,692 --> 01:05:06,984
You just get out of here...

871
01:05:07,025 --> 01:05:09,025
you please sit down...

872
01:05:09,525 --> 01:05:10,859
You guys are not going 
to understand this way,

873
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:15,317
we both had sex almost around 1000 
times...do you still want to sit down?

874
01:06:01,234 --> 01:06:04,900
Why are you staring at me as 
if i am dancing around naked ?

875
01:06:06,192 --> 01:06:09,025
I am hungry ...

876
01:06:09,192 --> 01:06:10,609
serve me some food.

877
01:06:21,859 --> 01:06:24,734
I used to feed you both from 
same plate since childhood..

878
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,109
*sighs*

879
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:30,525
people used to say i have 2 sons who 
are there for each other always.

880
01:06:30,984 --> 01:06:34,817
After they heard you 
performing they used to say,

881
01:06:34,817 --> 01:06:38,484
one got your voice and 
other got your skill.

882
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:44,025
There is not a single day 
passed by without me

883
01:06:44,025 --> 01:06:47,400
crying about your hatred 
towards each other.

884
01:06:47,525 --> 01:06:51,109
Stop lecturing...nothing has gone wrong...

885
01:06:51,192 --> 01:06:52,525
have food.

886
01:06:52,692 --> 01:06:57,025
You both have become enemies 
because of those Shaavukaaru.

887
01:06:59,984 --> 01:07:02,192
You both are brothers...

888
01:07:03,525 --> 01:07:06,150
not enemies.

889
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:13,525
Leave all those aside 
and get back together.

890
01:07:13,525 --> 01:07:18,942
Please sing and dance like 
before..i will be very happy.

891
01:07:25,984 --> 01:07:29,900
Election committee has finalised dates 
for legislative assembly elections

892
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:34,150
All the parties have fastened up their 
representative candidates selection.

893
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:38,484
Both the parties have got 
their Manifesto for Public

894
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:42,859
welfare ready and are waiting 
to take it to public .

895
01:07:43,275 --> 01:07:46,067
Along with leaders 
from Telangana,

896
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:49,192
Rayalaseema and both 
Godavari districts

897
01:07:49,192 --> 01:07:51,734
Vizag and Srikakulam 
are also gearing up

898
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:54,317
to prove themselves 
in this elections...

899
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,817
Get another plate.

900
01:07:59,317 --> 01:08:02,150
You all go have lunch and come back.

901
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,400
Ranga..you stay back.

902
01:08:05,775 --> 01:08:07,275
Come and sit here.

903
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,775
Have you lunch here for today.

904
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,025
Sir...here ??

905
01:08:14,484 --> 01:08:15,692
Yes, here.

906
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,442
-It is elections time.. 
-yes sir

907
01:08:25,442 --> 01:08:27,817
It will take time for Tarakesh 
to come back here from Vizag

908
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:29,900
even after coming back...

909
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,317
he cannot compete in elections.

910
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:39,275
I don't have dream to contest..all i 
want to do is support the contestants.

911
01:08:40,192 --> 01:08:42,359
I spent so much money 
on Kamma and Kapu

912
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,400
communities and made 
them powerful..

913
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:46,234
what's the use ??

914
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,484
That spineless fellow Karu naidu, 
who has zero guts has become MLA.

915
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:54,734
Padma, my brother's mistress 
has become a powerful lady.

916
01:08:55,192 --> 01:08:58,067
Rumour is it that...Karu 
naidu is contesting

917
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:00,650
as MP and Padma as 
MLA from that party.

918
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:04,650
I am planning to choose 
Dhora as MP candidate.

919
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,859
We have enough money..

920
01:09:06,984 --> 01:09:12,317
All we need is a trust worthy 
person to be our MLA Candidate.

921
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,650
I couldn't help you out 
in Panchayat elections..

922
01:09:19,025 --> 01:09:22,525
which is why i have chosen 
you as the MLA Candidate

923
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:23,734
to represent my party.

924
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,734
That is a huge responsibility sir..i 
don't think i can live up to it.

925
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:30,567
Long ago Karu naidu came to me requesting 
for a loan of 20 rs.

926
01:09:30,692 --> 01:09:32,817
You think he was born to become MLA ?

927
01:09:32,859 --> 01:09:34,275
As you sow, so shall you reap.

928
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,400
You just contest...i will 
take care of the rest.

929
01:09:40,942 --> 01:09:43,025
There is a small risk here....

930
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,067
until your brother is with my 
brother...we cannot defeat him.

931
01:10:00,859 --> 01:10:03,275
Opportunity doesn't knock your door always

932
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:04,567
you have to utilise it when it knocks..

933
01:10:04,692 --> 01:10:07,400
It's time for you to make 
use of the opportunity

934
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,734
if you want to grab this opportunity..your 
brother shouldn't be alive.

935
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:26,650
It's natural to think twice when you 
have to kill your own brother..

936
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:31,025
However if it's for our 
growth..then it isn't wrong.

937
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,984
Think about it....don't 
you want to get married

938
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:38,859
and be happy with a 
family of your own?

939
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:42,817
One in a million 
gets an opportunity

940
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:46,609
like this to become an 
MLA..think about it.

941
01:10:51,484 --> 01:10:54,650
You think he would do it ?

942
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:01,984
All the wars on this earth happened 
either for power or for women.

943
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:06,900
This world is filled with Leaders 
who kill their own kids for power..

944
01:11:07,484 --> 01:11:10,192
killing brother isn't a big deal.

945
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:44,775
Will you come to the lakeside ? 
I need to talk to you.

946
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:08,192
Today afternoon..i had lunch with Pedda 
Shaavukaaru in his house..along with him.

947
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:12,650
He is planning to make me his MLA 
candidate in these elections.

948
01:12:15,942 --> 01:12:19,025
He asked me to do something 
if i want to become MLA.

949
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:30,067
You shouldn't be alive.... 
...if i have to win.

950
01:12:31,442 --> 01:12:32,942
He told me to kill you.

951
01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:50,609
What did you decide ?

952
01:12:51,942 --> 01:12:53,442
*exhales*

953
01:12:56,525 --> 01:12:57,442
*spits*

954
01:13:04,067 --> 01:13:06,067
I have decided to kill.

955
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:41,942
what's the matter ? you 
are here so early ??

956
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,984
Did you come to buy fish ?

957
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,525
I thought about it sir....

958
01:13:46,984 --> 01:13:49,275
Oh ! about that ..

959
01:13:49,317 --> 01:13:50,650
we will talk about it later

960
01:13:50,734 --> 01:13:52,942
There is nothing left to talk about sir...

961
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:57,400
If i just keep thinking without taking a 
decision...

962
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,984
..you will hire some Kolkata guy

963
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:03,109
♫♫

964
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:06,150
(ominous music)

965
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:10,359
Pedda Shaavukaaru's son Tarakesh came 
back to village from Vizag

966
01:15:10,775 --> 01:15:15,150
Karu naidu's plan made Mohan rao and 
Ranga rao go back to Gurumurthy

967
01:15:16,192 --> 01:15:19,067
Both the brothers have killed 
your brother and absconded

968
01:15:19,775 --> 01:15:21,775
It's time for elections....

969
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:24,025
I got to know that Dhora is 
contesting from our opponent

970
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:26,109
party, who will be 
contesting from our party ?

971
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:28,400
What did you think about it Chinna Shaavukaru?

972
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:30,359
What's left to think about ?

973
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,900
My brother wasn't a God or something....

974
01:15:33,025 --> 01:15:36,234
It was his destiny 
to be killed by them

975
01:15:37,234 --> 01:15:38,734
Whom all do we have 
in our party ?

976
01:15:38,817 --> 01:15:41,317
Ranga rao, Mohan rao and their people.

977
01:15:42,025 --> 01:15:46,525
Do you think Ranga rao will come back 
and join us after all that has happened?

978
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:49,817
Their caste might be low 
but not their self respect

979
01:15:50,067 --> 01:15:51,734
If Ranga rao doesn't 
join us..Mohan rao

980
01:15:51,734 --> 01:15:53,859
will not join us, which 
will cost us a fortune.

981
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,067
If either one of them 
contests as an

982
01:15:56,109 --> 01:15:58,525
Independent Candidate..it will cost 
us more than a fortune.

983
01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:01,692
That doesn't mean we should 
allow them to be with us...

984
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,400
it is like inviting our own death.

985
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:05,317
(scoffs)

986
01:16:05,317 --> 01:16:07,817
They killed him in a fit of anger...

987
01:16:08,067 --> 01:16:10,567
they don't have a place to hide.

988
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:16,317
If we help them in this situation...they 
will be grateful to us forever.

989
01:16:16,442 --> 01:16:17,734
Do you think it's safe for us ?

990
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:18,942
You should call them.

991
01:16:19,317 --> 01:16:23,359
I got know today morning 
that SI Kondal Rao has been

992
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,859
suspended for not able to 
maintain Law and Order in Palasa.

993
01:16:27,859 --> 01:16:30,317
Authorities thought it would 
be justified if

994
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:32,900
new SI is from the same community 
and transferred a guy here.

995
01:16:32,942 --> 01:16:37,400
I heard that he is very adamant 
and doesn't bend to political power...

996
01:16:37,442 --> 01:16:42,067
...this time it is going to be 
a strict patroling at Polling booths.

997
01:16:43,109 --> 01:16:45,900
New SI ?? What's his name ?

998
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:50,359
He is a...Sebastian

999
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:52,567
(suspenseful music)

1000
01:16:55,942 --> 01:16:57,025
(engine revving)

1001
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,650
(church bells ringing)

1002
01:17:24,817 --> 01:17:25,734
Good morning

1003
01:17:25,817 --> 01:17:28,442
Sir, we have been waiting for 
you at the station ground.

1004
01:17:28,442 --> 01:17:30,525
Satyanarayana...before i 
take the up my position,

1005
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:32,192
i want to go around 
and see the village.

1006
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:34,900
By the time i come back to 
station, i want all the

1007
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:37,484
accused in the records to 
be gathered at the station.

1008
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:42,109
Also get a whip..the one used for 
animals..let us treat them today.

1009
01:17:42,942 --> 01:17:43,942
( motor starts)

1010
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:50,025
The first thing Sebastian did after 
taking charge was, feeding all the

1011
01:17:50,567 --> 01:17:55,984
rowdies in Palasa....People never 
saw such a strange SI in Palasa.

1012
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:04,650
I don't know on whose orders and why 
you did rowdyism in Palasa till now...

1013
01:18:04,942 --> 01:18:06,650
Everyone has a case filed against you...

1014
01:18:07,734 --> 01:18:11,234
it would be great if you all work 
in some Cashew factories around...

1015
01:18:11,484 --> 01:18:13,484
I will mind my work.

1016
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:16,109
Every 3 months,i will be inviting 
for this kind of lunch.

1017
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:18,734
It would be great if the count of 
people gathering here is going down...

1018
01:18:18,775 --> 01:18:22,984
you can take me as your new 
friend..you are all my new friends

1019
01:18:23,025 --> 01:18:25,442
it's difficult to remember all of you.

1020
01:18:31,734 --> 01:18:34,025
You will have your hair 
grown in 3 months..

1021
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:36,984
it's your call if you 
want to get it shaved

1022
01:18:36,984 --> 01:18:39,650
like this or to maintain 
a new hairstyle.

1023
01:18:40,109 --> 01:18:42,900
Just because you are a Police 
we are quiet inspite of you

1024
01:18:42,942 --> 01:18:46,442
getting our head shaved. This 
is Palasa Sir...be careful.

1025
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:49,317
Sir...

1026
01:18:49,484 --> 01:18:51,692
Sir..Sir..please don't hit me...Sir..

1027
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,025
Sir..please...please don't hit me..

1028
01:18:55,234 --> 01:18:58,734
I don't care if you belong to 
Palasa..remember i am Sebastian.

1029
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:11,567
*Bell rings*

1030
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,692
(footsteps approaching)

1031
01:19:13,942 --> 01:19:17,734
What is the status of the Lingamurthy 
murder case that happened in the market ?

1032
01:19:17,775 --> 01:19:21,775
Accused Ranga rao and Mohan rao are 
happily roaming around in the village sir.

1033
01:19:21,775 --> 01:19:23,275
Why were they not arrested ?

1034
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:25,942
Pedda Shaavukaaru's son and wife 
have filed a case sir....

1035
01:19:26,234 --> 01:19:29,442
..but no one is stepping forward 
as witness related that murder.

1036
01:19:29,567 --> 01:19:32,484
Fear is stronger than anything else...

1037
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:35,984
If that fear is erased 
..no one will

1038
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:39,150
hesitate to come forward and give 
witness in Pedda Shaavukaaru's case.

1039
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:40,692
(water splashes)

1040
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,442

01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,025
Fresh fish....Fresh fish

1044
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:19,817
Surmai..pomfret...Salmon

1045
01:20:20,109 --> 01:20:21,025
Live fish at throw away prices

1046
01:20:23,442 --> 01:20:24,734
What's the price of these ?

1047
01:20:24,734 --> 01:20:26,150
- 15r Rs. per kg sir 
- Do you have koyna ?

1048
01:20:26,234 --> 01:20:28,734
No sir..tell me if you 
want anything else ?

1049
01:20:29,317 --> 01:20:30,525
Will you give witness ?

1050
01:20:30,567 --> 01:20:31,567
What witness sir ?

1051
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:34,192
All you have to say is you 
saw the guys who killed

1052
01:20:34,234 --> 01:20:36,484
Pedda Shaavukaaru in the market....i 
will protect your life.

1053
01:20:36,692 --> 01:20:40,067
I did not see anything and i 
will not say anything sir.

1054
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:41,775
What if something like 
this happens with you

1055
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:43,275
or your family ..will 
you just let go ?

1056
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:44,984
You have to trust us.

1057
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:46,650
-I will not say sir... 
-Sir...

1058
01:20:47,817 --> 01:20:51,109
I will say it....they might 
not trust you but i will....

1059
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:53,775
I am willing to come and give my 
statement wherever you want me to give.

1060
01:20:56,484 --> 01:21:01,317
Sir, this is about the murder that took 
place in Palasa market on Feb 14th 1989

1061
01:21:01,984 --> 01:21:05,984
A Landlord called Lingamurthy was 
brutally killed by these two.

1062
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:09,650
Are there any witness to 
prove that they killed him?

1063
01:21:09,817 --> 01:21:12,192
Case has been reopened 
only after we got hold of witness sir.

1064
01:21:12,609 --> 01:21:14,192
Witness is here today.

1065
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:19,317
Tell the court about yourself.

1066
01:21:19,484 --> 01:21:20,900
My name is Jutthi neelakantham sir.

1067
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,900
Did you see the murder of Pedda 
Shaavukaaru alias Lingamurthy ?

1068
01:21:23,984 --> 01:21:26,400
No sir

1069
01:21:26,859 --> 01:21:27,484
(tense music)

1070
01:21:27,484 --> 01:21:29,609
Huh..So,we are back to square one.

1071
01:21:31,275 --> 01:21:35,275
These cases will never be solved....we saw 
so many cases like these...let's proceed.

1072
01:21:35,484 --> 01:21:37,692
Police said that you saw the murder.

1073
01:21:39,192 --> 01:21:43,484
Inspector asked me if i knew 
Mohan rao and Ranga rao ...

1074
01:21:43,734 --> 01:21:47,109
I know 2 guys with same name 
from the shores sir...i thought

1075
01:21:47,109 --> 01:21:50,484
he was asking about them...i 
have never seen these guys sir.

1076
01:21:50,609 --> 01:21:53,025
But you told us you saw 
these guys killing...

1077
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:55,900
Do you have any other witness?

1078
01:21:56,025 --> 01:21:58,817
When they threatened to kill 
the wife of the guy who

1079
01:21:58,817 --> 01:22:01,275
came to give witness...will 
he tell the truth?

1080
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:04,192
Judge has ruled out the 
case because of lack of

1081
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:07,067
evidence....Both the 
brothers came out clean.

Tarakesh, isn't your blood boil listening 
to the parade happening outside ?

1095
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:03,192
Those guys who killed your father are 
roaming in the streets like Heroes

1096
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:08,234
Your father used to sit 
here and do finance

1097
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:11,484
business...He was like a 
king of liquor business.

1098
01:23:11,734 --> 01:23:15,567
No one succeeded more than him 
in Cashew business in Palasa.

1099
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:22,859
They brutally killed such a man 
in the streets and beheaded him.

1100
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:27,067
Did you come from Vizag to smoke 
weed and sleep with prostitues?

1101
01:23:29,317 --> 01:23:31,525
Do you know what people are saying?

1102
01:23:31,525 --> 01:23:36,442
Are you your father's blood 
or did i sleep with....

1103
01:23:37,234 --> 01:23:42,734
*sobs*

1104

*sobs*

1106
01:23:57,192 --> 01:23:59,567
To play chess all you need to 
know is how to play the game,

1107
01:23:59,609 --> 01:24:01,650
you don't need to be smart.

1108
01:24:01,692 --> 01:24:06,400
I know how to play and how 
to be smart in the play.

1109
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:12,150
I am Pedda Shaavukaaru's son..every wish 
of yours will be fulfilled...don't worry.

1110
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:09,859

1111
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:14,692

(motor stops)

1113
01:25:38,942 --> 01:25:41,609
I was planning to come 
and meet you Inspector sir.

1114
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:44,192
I am contesting in 
elections this time.

1115
01:25:44,234 --> 01:25:46,442
You should personally 
take care of the

1116
01:25:46,442 --> 01:25:49,025
election security and 
help me win peacefully.

1117
01:25:49,567 --> 01:25:52,484
Elections will not stop 
for anyone..all i doubt is

1118
01:25:52,525 --> 01:25:55,400
....if you will be 
contetsing this time or not?

1119
01:25:56,775 --> 01:25:59,484
You have a very good sense of humor sir.

1120
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:02,359
I have information from 
higher authorities that

1121
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,400
i will get my ticket confirmed 
by today or tomorrow.

1122
01:26:04,484 --> 01:26:08,484
I got information from my authorities 
too..a good news and bad news.

1123
01:26:10,109 --> 01:26:12,317
Your brother's son filed a 
petition addressing collector that

1124
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,817
a murderer should not be 
contesting in the elections.

1125
01:26:14,859 --> 01:26:17,275
Collector wrote a report to 
the government which made

1126
01:26:17,317 --> 01:26:19,567
my head authority give me 
a strict rule that not a

1127
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:22,067
single drop of blood should 
be shed in Palasa elections.

1128
01:26:23,234 --> 01:26:24,817
If these both are seen 
in this village..you

1129
01:26:24,942 --> 01:26:26,275
will not be getting your ticket

1130
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:31,359
If i see them in this village , i will 
do an encounter stating they were

1131
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:33,817
disturbing peace and security 
of the village....

1132
01:26:33,859 --> 01:26:35,817
it's very easy for me to 
get an order for this.

1133
01:26:35,817 --> 01:26:39,317
You think we are your pet 
dogs you can kill....

1134
01:26:39,692 --> 01:26:41,400
Don't show your rowdyism with me.

1135
01:26:41,609 --> 01:26:43,609
I can beat the shit out of 
you and legalise my act.

1136
01:26:43,692 --> 01:26:46,192
I can give 100 reasons to justify 
my act..try raising your hand on me

1137
01:26:46,317 --> 01:26:48,609
-I will shoot you right here and leave. 
-Stop it Mohan.

1138
01:26:50,192 --> 01:26:52,067
What do you want me to do now ?

1139
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:55,234
You just mind your cashew business..these 
both shouldn't be seen in this village.

1140
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,234
If you do this..you might get your 
ticket...This is the good news,

1141
01:26:58,234 --> 01:27:00,817
If not, you wouldn't get 
your ticket and these

1142
01:27:00,859 --> 01:27:03,192
both will not survive..this 
is the bad news.

1143
01:27:03,317 --> 01:27:07,192
My name is Sebastian, i will 
not repeat it....Mind you.

1144
01:27:08,734 --> 01:27:11,650
SI's words created fear in Gurumurthy.

1145
01:27:11,817 --> 01:27:14,859
He convinced Mohan rao and 
Ranga rao to leave Palasa

1146
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:18,650
for few days and come back 
after it's settled down.

1147
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:37,484
(leaves rustling)

1148
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:48,317
Once our boss wins, I will have 
to look into the eyes of the SI

1149
01:27:48,359 --> 01:27:51,942
and tell him that his gun is 
useless to atleast scratch my back.

1150
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:53,442
Shut up

1151
01:27:53,692 --> 01:27:58,900
He is a Policeman and he hates 
us to death, which is justified.

1152
01:28:22,609 --> 01:28:24,484
Sundar rao was worried 
that his sons turned

1153
01:28:24,484 --> 01:28:26,359
out to be rowdies and 
died out of depression.

1154
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:32,650
Tarakesh was the one who planned 
to kill Ranga rao and Mohan rao.

1155
01:28:33,109 --> 01:28:35,609
He perfectly mastered in 
creating a rift between

1156
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:38,150
enemies and utilising the 
situation to his favour.

1157
01:28:39,734 --> 01:28:43,817
This time Muthyalu was 
Tarakesh's bait to his enemies.

1158
01:28:54,484 --> 01:28:56,192
See,I don't want to beat around the bush.

1159
01:28:56,359 --> 01:29:00,775
You have been working with us 
since my father's time,

1160
01:29:01,859 --> 01:29:04,192
I know how honest you are.

1161
01:29:05,234 --> 01:29:07,734
I know he eloped with your sister,

1162
01:29:07,734 --> 01:29:11,734
your sister ditched you and 
you lost your programs.

1163
01:29:11,942 --> 01:29:16,359
He is very happy under the 
protection of my uncle.

1164
01:29:20,067 --> 01:29:20,984
take this.

1165
01:29:24,567 --> 01:29:26,150
You deserve to be happy..

1166
01:29:27,567 --> 01:29:30,067
I don't have any one who is 
strong enough to support me.

1167
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:37,942
My uncle got scared about what the SI 
told him and sent them away from Palasa.

1168
01:29:38,734 --> 01:29:44,025
It's time for me to plan and take 
revenge on people who killed my father.

1169
01:29:46,609 --> 01:29:49,525
If he dies, your sister 
will become a widow...

1170
01:29:50,817 --> 01:29:53,692
it's my responsibility 
to get her married again.

1171
01:29:54,859 --> 01:29:58,275
I got few men from Burma camp.

1172
01:29:59,234 --> 01:30:01,609
All you have to do is win 
the trust of those brothers

1173
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:04,525
and bring in your 
brother-in-law....got it?

1174
01:30:07,025 --> 01:30:08,317
Here..take this.

1175
01:30:11,775 --> 01:30:16,067
If he isn't alive..i will 
make you the king of palasa.

1176
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:19,025
If that doesn't happen then...

1177
01:30:25,609 --> 01:30:29,900
♪♪♪

1178
01:30:29,984 --> 01:30:34,859
Leave everything..we will stay back here. 
Let us get your brother and Gauri

1179
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:39,484
married. We all can form a group and 
start performing in programs again.

1180
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:41,734
I can't sing anymore....

1181
01:30:42,025 --> 01:30:44,109
all those are outdated now.

1182
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,567
It's all about record dances now,

1183
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:50,609
we don't know about them. 
My father has left Poetry

1184
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:54,734
...we stopped dancing 
and started killing.

1185
01:30:55,275 --> 01:30:57,984
We should perform on what 
public wants to see...

1186
01:30:58,025 --> 01:31:00,692
look at Dandaasi and your 
brother, how hard they

1187
01:31:00,692 --> 01:31:03,859
have been trying to try 
those kind of dances.

1188
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:09,359
Even if we learn ..we cannot play 
in those streets anymore Lakshmi.

1189
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:11,859
We are in deep mess..

1190
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,484
It's not easy to get out of this mess.

1191
01:31:14,609 --> 01:31:18,525
We never know when, how and by whom 
we will be killed.

1192
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:23,150
I might look tough outside but 
i am scared for my life within.

1193
01:31:24,525 --> 01:31:27,984
All i want is... to leave this 
behind, perform like previous times,

1194
01:31:27,984 --> 01:31:31,442
eat the food cooked 
by you and be happy.

1195
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,609
It's not late...listen to 
me and leave all these.

1196
01:31:35,609 --> 01:31:40,942
You are an artist..our lives have 
been ruined by those Shaavukaru brothers.

1197
01:31:42,775 --> 01:31:45,400
They need our strength to 
lift their Cashew bags,

1198
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,984
they need us to sing in their 
gatherings, weddings and deaths.

1199
01:31:50,775 --> 01:31:53,692
We have to kill for them....

1200
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:59,900
we did all they wanted us to 
do...they are happy..are we happy ?

1201
01:32:00,984 --> 01:32:03,150
It isn't the mistake of 
the one who made the sword...

1202
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,900
..it's the mistake of 
the one who misused it.

1203
01:32:06,067 --> 01:32:10,484
I am not smart enough to think all 
these...all i know is to listen to what

1204
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:14,567
Shaavukaru says in the morning and 
sleep next to you in the night.

1205
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:18,234
You have think about it...i 
will listen to whatever you say.

1206
01:32:18,234 --> 01:32:20,775
Do you think the one who 
is coming will listen to you?

1207
01:32:20,859 --> 01:32:21,775
Who is coming ?

1208
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:27,484
We are going to have a baby.

1209
01:32:37,067 --> 01:32:40,150
You think you can become 
Heroes by dancing like this ?

1210
01:32:40,192 --> 01:32:43,317
Stop staring at me. Don't you have 
the courtesy to call me inside?

1211
01:32:43,317 --> 01:32:45,817
Mohan Rao, your brother-in-law is here.

1212
01:33:04,817 --> 01:33:09,109
If my parents were alive, they would have 
given her all that she needed.

1213
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:14,234
I don't have anyone to tell me 
about rituals...i am all alone.

1214
01:33:14,442 --> 01:33:19,025
Whatever has happened has happened...I 
have to give you both new clothes in

1215
01:33:19,067 --> 01:33:24,484
Mankinamma temple and offer a hen to the 
goddess. Shall we plan it for tomorrow ?

1216
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:28,442
You think you will you be done 
just by giving us new clothes?

1217
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:32,025
Get ready with some silver 
jewelry within 6-7 months.

1218
01:33:32,109 --> 01:33:37,734
You have so much to do 
as an uncle to the baby.

1219
01:33:38,567 --> 01:33:41,650
-Is it true, sister ? 
-yes.

1220
01:33:42,734 --> 01:33:46,317
Please take care of my sister.

1221
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:49,900
"When you de-skin the feathers of the hen"

1222
01:33:49,984 --> 01:33:52,984
"all it keeps telling you 
is, how it has flown"

1223
01:33:53,025 --> 01:33:55,984
"all the way through the 
village to come to you..."

1224
01:33:56,025 --> 01:33:59,817
"..all it does is trying 
to escape..oh dear hen"

1225
01:34:00,583 --> 01:34:01,583
(hens clucking)

1226
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:10,125
(birds chirping)

1227
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,583
*whistles*

1228
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,625
Mohan rao..take care

1229
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:30,458
Finish it off quickly

1230
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,041
(birds chirping)

1231
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:43,666
Though Muthyalu was an idiot, he was 
smart and a good human being.

1232
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:48,750
He ditched Tarakesh and saved 
his sister & brother-in-law.

1233
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:53,000
Tarakesh never knew what 
happened to the Burma camp guys.

1234
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:06,375
Everyone thought Mohan rao 
has tore them to pieces.

1235
01:36:27,666 --> 01:36:30,166
I couldn't do anything mom,

1236
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:33,875
I couldn't take revenge on 
those who killed dad.

1237
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:36,708
I am a loser mom...

1238
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:42,166
I don't have enough strength, 
i don't know what do to.

1239
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:47,166
*sobs*

1240
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:49,208
I want to die mom.

1241
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:58,666
Am unable to do anything to them 
with my limp..i just want to die.

1242
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:03,791
You are the son of Pedda Shaavukaaru

1243
01:37:03,791 --> 01:37:06,958
Think what would your father 
do in this situation.

1244
01:37:07,166 --> 01:37:10,583
Shall i tell you your mistake ?

1245
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:15,208
You hired killers who kill for money.

1246
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,458
Get up...

1247
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:20,125
All you need is the one who 
can share your revenge,

1248
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:22,541
search for someone like that.

1249
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:27,083
Your father calmed down 
after Bhairagi was killed.

1250
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:32,541
After Bhairagi was killed, no 
one knew where his son has been.

1251
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:37,166
I heard it from your father 
once that he joined Naxals.

1252
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:48,958
After his father's death, Bhairagi's son 
Ganapavaasu alias Vaasu brother alias

1253
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:50,791
younger Bhairagi 
felt directionless.

1254
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:55,291
He left the village and joined Naxals 
without any knowledge of revolt.

1255
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:23,333
Younger Bhairagi thought it is good 
to be with Tarakesh rather than

1256
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:27,000
being with Naxals. He went and 
surrendered infront of District SP.

1257
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:29,750
All the procedure was 
taken care by Tarakesh.

1258
01:38:29,916 --> 01:38:34,833
Inspector Sebastian was the only 
one who knew why he surrendered.

1259
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:40,500
I heard you wanted to see me

1260
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,791
I will come straight to the point.

1261
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:46,000
Send some tea.

1262
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,916
If you came here to change 
yourself well and good...

1263
01:38:51,083 --> 01:38:54,500
i know ....you din't come for that.

1264
01:38:55,916 --> 01:38:59,000
I don't want blood and 
Violence in this village.

1265
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:02,250
I have an idea whom you 
are going to work for.

1266
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:06,666
If you start working for that..i will 
start working on what i have to do.

1267
01:39:06,958 --> 01:39:08,791
*scoffs*

1268
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,083
What is this sir?

1269
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:13,958
All i planned is to work in the 
Cashew factory and lead my life.

1270
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:16,750
You called me to the station 
and are talking irrelevantly.

1271
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:19,875
Vaasu, i know whose factory 
you are to going to work at.

1272
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:23,125
Just remember this...

1273
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:27,375
It doesn't matter if i shoot 
in Palasa or the forest...

1274
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:30,708
it is still called an encounter. 
Don't push me to that extent.

1275
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:39,666
I will take your leave Sir. Take care.

1276
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:46,541
Namaste Sir.

1277
01:39:48,208 --> 01:39:49,125
♫♫

1278
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:04,791
You both roamed around 
the village so many times

1279
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:07,041
and you are suddenly feeling shy.

1280
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:09,000
Keep quiet.

1281
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:12,000
Gajula Gauri feeling shy is 
like a miracle and we have

1282
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:14,708
been waiting to see it....don't 
you dare to spoil it.

1283
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:16,375
Just shut up you guys.

1284
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:19,958
Oh My god ...Ranga got angry,

1285
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:24,125
let her get married to you, she 
will screw your happiness.

1286
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:27,500
Stop joking about such 
an auspicious occasion.

1287
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:30,541
Looks like you both have 
become close to each other.

1288
01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:31,791
Look at them

1289
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:34,750
Stop playing around and get up everyone.

1290
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:45,708
Ganapvaasu who was in the forests, 
has come back and joined Tarakesh.

1291
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,166
There is something fishy 
happening in the village.

1292
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,375
I feel Tarakesh , Ganapavaasu and 
Inspector have joined hands.

1293
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,166
What are you saying?

1294
01:40:53,666 --> 01:40:56,291
When i went to tell the inspector about 
the reason for us coming into the

1295
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:59,416
village..i saw Ganapavaasu leaving the 
station after meeting the inspector.

1296
01:41:00,333 --> 01:41:04,041
Wedding is in 4 days. After 
that we are going to kill them.

1297
01:41:04,083 --> 01:41:09,250
We should kill them even before 
they plan anything against us.

1298
01:41:18,666 --> 01:41:23,958
This has been made in Barampur...we 
can't rely on it completely.

1299
01:41:25,041 --> 01:41:26,125
This is from Nepal,

1300
01:41:26,416 --> 01:41:28,416
It's on a higer price,

1301
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:32,041
but will not miss the target.

1302
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:35,958
I have ordered for four.

1303
01:41:36,833 --> 01:41:38,458
These are perfect.

1304
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:43,541
You don't need to go near the person 
but can kill him without any hassle.

1305
01:41:43,666 --> 01:41:45,166
-Understood. 
-Yes.

1306
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:48,166
Did you find out where they are ?

1307
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:53,166
I have hired men to find out.

1308
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,916
We are approaching towards elections.

1309
01:41:56,833 --> 01:42:01,833
Sir, Doctor Mandasa sir has come to meet you.

1310
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:04,583
You can leave now.

1311
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:07,166
I have called the doctor 
to talk to him about

1312
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:08,750
representing our party 
in the elections.

1313
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:10,958
Will call you after am 
done talking to him.

1314
01:42:24,083 --> 01:42:27,208
Just because Ganapavaasu is with 
us, will we win the elections?

1315
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:31,416
Your uncle's ticket is confirmed. Mohan 
rao and Ranga rao will be coming

1316
01:42:31,458 --> 01:42:36,125
back to the village in a day or 
two...all these will not work out sir.

1317
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:39,541
You don't need to spend 
a single penny doctor,

1318
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:42,958
I know that we can't 
win this elections but

1319
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:48,666
my uncle should know that we 
still have power within us.

1320
01:42:48,958 --> 01:42:51,958
Entire Palasa should talk 
about how i bounced back.

1321
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:56,958
Which means this is like a 
lifeless marriage. I can't

1322
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,333
contest inspite of knowing 
that i will loose sir.

1323
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:05,875
Trust me, Mohan rao and Ranga rao 
will not work for this elections.

1324
01:43:05,958 --> 01:43:06,958
What are you saying Sir ?

1325
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:10,083
They are not just plant saplings to 
remove and throw them away..they are

1326
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:14,500
huge trees with roots buried deep inside. 
It's not as easy as you say sir.

1327
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:17,916
Anyway i will not win and i will 
get into bad books of your uncle

1328
01:43:17,916 --> 01:43:21,291
for contesting. Why should i go 
through all these? Please leave me.

1329
01:43:22,166 --> 01:43:25,083
Please sit down.

1330
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:29,041
Just give it a thought.

1331
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:31,625
For those who killed your 
father, its' not difficult for

1332
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:34,333
them to kill me if you uncle 
instructs them. Please leave me.

1333
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:42,625
Inspite of working your ass off in the 
business and spoiling your health

1334
01:43:42,666 --> 01:43:45,000
you are sitting here and 
begging these idiots.

1335
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
You will spend our money, make someonelse 
sit on the throne and be happy.

1336
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:50,708
Your father did the same mistake...

1337
01:43:50,916 --> 01:43:56,250
He kept all the low class fellows 
on his head and they beheaded him.

1338
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:58,500
You don't know anything..just go inside.

1339
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,500
*slaps*

1340
01:44:01,083 --> 01:44:03,250
Did i give birth to you or 
is it the other way around ?

1341
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:07,125
I have been seeing all these since 
the day i stepped into this

1342
01:44:07,458 --> 01:44:11,083
house as a daughter-in-law. I 
know them much better than you do.

1343
01:44:11,791 --> 01:44:18,791
Stop begging all those people. 
Go and plead your uncle.

1344
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:25,375
Why not ? He is your father's own brother.

1345
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:29,125
Tomorrow when he dies..you are the 
one who has to perform his last rites.

1346
01:44:41,166 --> 01:44:42,791
All of you wait outside...

1347
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:45,708
i have to talk to my brother-in-law.

1348
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:52,541
Look at this fellow. Just like 
you and your brother did,

1349
01:44:52,541 --> 01:44:56,166
he wants to feed money to useless 
people and make them sit on the throne.

1350
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:59,375
He plans to make someone as your opponent.

1351
01:45:00,791 --> 01:45:05,458
Enough of the fights that 
happened between you siblings.

1352
01:45:07,166 --> 01:45:12,666
Didn't i take care of you like a son, 
when i stepped into this house ?

1353
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:18,125
Did you forget those days when you used 
to keep chanting my name Gurumurthy ?

1354
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:21,875
You both are the only 
ones left in our dynasty.

1355
01:45:22,375 --> 01:45:25,833
One day when you are still 
with your mistress and die

1356
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:29,333
...he is the one to 
perform your last rites.

1357
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:33,625
He is your family's blood.

1358
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:36,750
He will make someone contest 
and you will kill him

1359
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,750
after that he will come to kill you...

1360
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:41,375
I can't take anymore of these,

1361
01:45:41,666 --> 01:45:43,291
which is why i have brought him here.

1362
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:48,000
Kill him right here and also do me the 
favour of giving some poison and kill me.

1363
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:52,083
I don't have patience to 
see all these anymore.

1364
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:57,333
*wails*

1365
01:45:57,375 --> 01:46:00,875
*wails*

1366
01:46:01,041 --> 01:46:06,375
*wails*

1367
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:25,708
Hello Sir, This is Gurumurthy speaking.

1368
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:28,833
Just a small change 
...In these elections i

1369
01:46:28,833 --> 01:46:31,916
will not be contesting 
representing our party.

1370
01:46:36,291 --> 01:46:39,583
My son will be contesting sir,

1371
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:43,083
Namaste Sir.

1372
01:46:56,208 --> 01:47:00,541
Padma, serve food to my 
sister-in-law and my nephew

1373
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:04,250
Dear people of Palasa..

1374
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:06,291
Hail Chinna Shaavukaru

1375
01:47:06,291 --> 01:47:08,291
Hail Tarakesh Sir..

1376
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:22,416
I will talk to the MRO tomorrow and 
take care of it...You can leave now.

1377
01:47:28,583 --> 01:47:30,666
This time there is no competition,

1378
01:47:31,541 --> 01:47:34,750
Independent candidates who are 
contesting hardly get any votes.

1379
01:47:37,833 --> 01:47:41,250
This time we shouldn't be doing rigging. 
Sebastian will not tolerate it.

1380
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:49,000
We need a favour Sir....it's...

1381
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:52,708
It's in your hands.

1382
01:47:56,250 --> 01:48:01,833
Just like Bhairagi was to my 
father..Vaasu is for us Uncle.

1383
01:48:03,166 --> 01:48:05,791
We are ready to do whatever you say, Uncle

1384
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:09,958
But there is one unfinished 
task we have to do.

1385
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:15,875
They will never come back to Palasa again.

1386
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:18,791
We are close to elections, 
don't do anything foolish.

1387
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:22,125
What if those who killed my father and 
his father step into this house ?

1388
01:48:22,666 --> 01:48:24,875
Should i mingle with them 
as if nothing happened ?

1389
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:26,541
what do you want me to do ?

1390
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:28,041
Elder one is getting married..

1391
01:48:29,166 --> 01:48:31,541
While they are busy 
preparing for the wedding..

1392
01:48:32,166 --> 01:48:34,875
...we should silently 
finish the task.

1393
01:48:36,083 --> 01:48:37,208
Tell me sir....

1394
01:48:37,375 --> 01:48:40,291
Are you having a soft corner 
becasue they are your men ?

1395
01:48:40,541 --> 01:48:42,416
You are my man now.

1396
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:46,041
I don't have any affection towards 
them neither do i hate them.

1397
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:49,958
Okay then...do as you wish.

1398
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,791
Be careful..

1399
01:48:55,083 --> 01:48:57,291
Both the brothers should 
be killed at once.

1400
01:48:57,708 --> 01:49:01,291
It would be very difficult if either one 
of them survives...just remember this.

1401
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:09,916
What will you do ?

1402
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:12,541
How many men do you need ?

1403
01:49:14,708 --> 01:49:16,791
We got the pistol from Barampur,

1404
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:18,916
that will take care.

1405
01:49:19,833 --> 01:49:21,750
We need 4 Pondur khaadi Lungis.

1406
01:49:21,833 --> 01:49:23,041
How is this ?

1407
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:25,083
You look good in any color.

1408
01:49:33,291 --> 01:49:37,208
You take Gauri home...me and your 
sister are going for a movie.

1409
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:38,125
What about both of us ?

1410
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:41,291
You can go with my brother.

1411
01:49:41,333 --> 01:49:43,541
Where is he ? He said he will 
come but he din't turn up.

1412
01:49:43,666 --> 01:49:47,166
He said he will distribute wedding cards 
in Bairpally, Gangavaada and head home.

1413
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:48,958
Okay..come home early.

1414
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:59,583
We are coming after a long time and you 
are making me watch this old movie ?

1415
01:50:00,166 --> 01:50:04,041
There is only one movie hall in this 
village unlike in our Village Palasa.

1416
01:50:04,208 --> 01:50:09,208
Even thought it's an old movie,it feels 
good if i watch it with you..keep watching

1417
01:50:09,916 --> 01:50:15,416
( we spent a lot on your studies 
, god will never forgive you )

1418
01:50:16,999 --> 01:50:18,791
Distributing so many 
wedding invitations for

1419
01:50:18,833 --> 01:50:20,749
your wedding has become 
so painful for me.

1420
01:50:20,874 --> 01:50:22,499
Are you so exhausted ?

1421
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:25,458
You are as heavy as a rice bag...

1422
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:29,249
my legs are almost swollen by cycling 
especially with you sitting behind me.

1423
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:31,833
Take care of your legs, 
your brother has arranged

1424
01:50:31,874 --> 01:50:34,374
for your first night on 
your wedding day itseems

1425
01:50:34,458 --> 01:50:36,416
We will be done 
by tomorrow after

1426
01:50:36,458 --> 01:50:39,166
distributing cards in 
Goppili and Garbandha.

1427
01:50:39,249 --> 01:50:42,541
Stop here..i need to pee, my 
bladder is about to burst.

1428
01:50:43,041 --> 01:50:44,458
( crickets chirping )

1429
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:55,124
"my mother-in-law told 
me to go for swimming"

1430
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:57,541
"and when i went she 
said don't swim..."

1431
01:50:57,583 --> 01:51:00,499
"her daughter is like 
a beautiful lilly"

1432
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:03,124
(ominous music)

1433
01:51:03,458 --> 01:51:04,958
Ranga run

1434
01:51:06,874 --> 01:51:07,791
( screams)

1435
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:13,416
(i warned you before, 
look what happened now)

1436
01:51:13,416 --> 01:51:14,916
(what a pain this is)

1437
01:51:15,374 --> 01:51:18,999
(i don't know why am i still 
dealing with all these)

1438
01:51:19,124 --> 01:51:23,333
(we are not worth as she says, we 
should leave the house*cries*)

1439
01:51:23,499 --> 01:51:25,916

(*crying*, dont cry )

1441
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:37,458
(i heard the baby crying, 
went up to take care of him )

1442
01:51:37,749 --> 01:51:38,666
*lights up the bomb*

1443
01:51:38,874 --> 01:51:41,166
(i din't expect this would happen)

1444
01:51:42,999 --> 01:51:45,499
(please don't get mad at me)

1445
01:51:45,958 --> 01:51:46,874
(don't take out this anger on.....)

1446
01:51:47,083 --> 01:51:50,916
(you are his new found love..i don't have 
any say in all these) *instant screaming*

*everyone cries*

1462
01:54:13,124 --> 01:54:16,749
They killed our Ranga.

1463
01:54:17,458 --> 01:54:23,541
They waited for us on the road 
and chopped him into pieces.

1464
01:54:24,999 --> 01:54:25,916

1469
01:54:39,666 --> 01:54:42,249
You missed the one who 
should have been killed.

1470
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:45,249
You said you were an expert in shooting ?

1471
01:54:45,333 --> 01:54:47,166
You boasted so much about yourself...

1472
01:54:47,249 --> 01:54:49,041
Do you think he will leave us now ?

1473
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:52,416
He might have got to know 
about the entire plan by now.

1474
01:54:53,166 --> 01:54:55,958
He will make sure he will 
kill all three of you.

1475
01:54:56,166 --> 01:54:59,583
The crowd present there started shouting, 
so....i had to run away from there.

1476
01:54:59,916 --> 01:55:01,791
Run away to some other place just 
like you ran away from there

1477
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:03,666
you don't have enough guts.

1478
01:55:03,749 --> 01:55:06,249
Just shut up.

1479
01:55:11,249 --> 01:55:13,166
No one needs to run away....

1480
01:55:13,708 --> 01:55:14,624
...do as i say.

1481
01:55:14,958 --> 01:55:17,833
Send our team to the theatre. 
Mohan rao will meet them.

1482
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:20,499
I will meet you there. 
*hangs the phone*

1483
01:55:30,041 --> 01:55:31,833
Thinking that it will 
be late by the time you

1484
01:55:31,833 --> 01:55:34,374
receive this..i have 
personally brought it.

1485
01:55:34,458 --> 01:55:35,333
What is this ?

1486
01:55:35,458 --> 01:55:37,333
Shoot at sight order.

1487
01:55:37,374 --> 01:55:39,583
Shoot the person as soon as you see him...

1488
01:55:39,583 --> 01:55:43,541
Government got information that a 
criminal called Mohan rao is planning

1489
01:55:43,749 --> 01:55:48,124
to kill me and my uncle, based on 
that they have sent you this order.

1490
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:50,416
What is the need for this order, 
when he isn't staying in Palasa ?

1491
01:55:50,458 --> 01:55:52,833
That idiot has developed 
grudge on us thinking

1492
01:55:52,958 --> 01:55:55,249
we have killed his 
wife and his brother.

1493
01:55:55,749 --> 01:55:57,458
Please protect us from him,

1494
01:55:57,541 --> 01:55:59,666
get hold of him and kill him.

1495
01:55:59,749 --> 01:56:03,333
It's an order from the goverment 
and i should follow it.

1496
01:56:05,666 --> 01:56:11,666
You wanted to shoot them long 
back..now is the time...Thank you.

1497
01:56:17,374 --> 01:56:18,541
(resentful music)

1498
01:56:30,666 --> 01:56:36,541
*cries loudly*

1499
01:56:42,041 --> 01:56:47,749
*wails*

1500
01:57:01,541 --> 01:57:04,041
Lakshmi...please get up

1501
01:57:04,166 --> 01:57:08,958
You wanted me to leave all 
these...i will leave all these.

1502
01:57:09,166 --> 01:57:11,958
We will start singing again. 
*cries*

1503
01:57:13,333 --> 01:57:15,249
*wails*

1504
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:18,958
Brother who will play drums for me?

1505
01:57:18,958 --> 01:57:21,666
Look Gauri is crying..

1506
01:57:22,083 --> 01:57:24,416
*cries*

1507
01:57:24,458 --> 01:57:27,833
Your wedding is in 4 days and 
you are sleeping like this....

1508
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:29,958
Get up brother... 
*cries*

1509
01:57:30,041 --> 01:57:35,666
*cries loudly*

1510
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:39,249
Lakshmi, whom are you 
carrying in your womb ?

1511
01:57:39,499 --> 01:57:43,499
How can you leave me without 
showing if it's a boy or a girl ?

1512
01:57:43,541 --> 01:57:44,958
*sobs*

1513
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:50,833
Brother see...they killed my wife.

1514
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:57,249
Get up brother..let's go 
to the Shaavukaaru. *sobs*

1515
01:57:57,333 --> 01:57:59,541
You still want to go to Shaavukaru??

1516
01:57:59,541 --> 01:58:01,833
Both Uncle and nephew has 
joined hands together.

1517
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:05,958
Your dearest Shaavukaru is the one 
who sent them to kill you both.

1518
01:58:07,958 --> 01:58:10,458
They don't need you both...

1519
01:58:15,249 --> 01:58:17,166
*panting* 
*sobs*

1520
01:58:18,541 --> 01:58:19,833
Mohan rao..

1521
01:58:19,958 --> 01:58:22,666
....you became all alone.

1522
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:25,749
There are men roaming around to kill you.

1523
01:58:27,958 --> 01:58:30,166
Complete the rituals first.

1524
01:58:30,333 --> 01:58:33,458
*cries* 
*panting*

1525
01:58:33,666 --> 01:58:38,833
Rituals will happen only 
after i kill those three.

1526
01:58:38,874 --> 01:58:39,916
( Breathing heavily)

1527
01:59:22,833 --> 01:59:28,666
*shrieks*

1528
01:59:47,333 --> 01:59:51,333
Muthyalu....get up...

1529
01:59:51,333 --> 01:59:55,666
*cries*

1530
01:59:55,708 --> 02:00:01,708
*wails*

1531
02:00:01,749 --> 02:00:07,541
*cries* 
get up..

1532
02:00:07,666 --> 02:00:11,333
*cries* 
*panting*

1533
02:00:14,333 --> 02:00:17,749
Are you hiding here? Bloody bastards. 
*gasps*

1534
02:00:17,833 --> 02:00:20,166
I left this village only half alive..

1535
02:00:20,249 --> 02:00:22,374
Now you killed me completely.

1536
02:00:22,458 --> 02:00:24,458
You killed my entire family.

1537
02:00:24,541 --> 02:00:26,791
Did we get into your houses 
or slept in your rooms ?

1538
02:00:26,874 --> 02:00:30,416
We even started living somewhere 
else...what was our mistake ?

1539
02:00:30,458 --> 02:00:32,958
- Will you not let us live ? 
- Mohan rao...

1540
02:00:33,041 --> 02:00:35,666
*Gun shot* 
*Shrieks*

1541
02:00:37,333 --> 02:00:39,458
Kill this bastard sir...

1542
02:00:39,541 --> 02:00:42,666
You wanted to kill us ? 
see what happens now.

1543
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:47,249
You also have an order..Kill 
this ass hole right here...kill him

1544
02:00:47,333 --> 02:00:50,583
I am a government servant 
not your personal servant

1545
02:00:50,666 --> 02:00:53,916
to do whatever you say. We 
have our own procedure.

1546
02:00:54,541 --> 02:00:55,541
Come on, move.

1547
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:58,874
(engine revving)

1548
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:02,833
Long ago, you said you 
will kill me..kill me now.

1549
02:01:03,041 --> 02:01:06,333
We haven't come far from there. 
Leave me for an hour

1550
02:01:06,333 --> 02:01:10,749
I will kill all three of them and 
will come to you for surrendering.

1551
02:01:10,833 --> 02:01:13,041
You think i am an idiot 
to trust a goon like you.

1552
02:01:13,166 --> 02:01:18,749
Rowdies like you should die 
in such unfortunate ways.

1553
02:01:20,749 --> 02:01:25,083
(tyres screeching) 
(engine stops)

1554
02:01:42,541 --> 02:01:44,749
*Gun shot*

1555
02:01:45,499 --> 02:01:47,416
(sir, we have been receiving reports of 
trees falling down because of storm.....)

1556
02:01:47,458 --> 02:01:51,166
How did Ganapavaasu become so 
powerful that he became a MLA ?

1557
02:01:51,416 --> 02:01:56,249
I heard Gurumurthy and Tarakesh 
are powerful men in Palasa.

1558
02:01:56,666 --> 02:01:59,249
What happened after Mohan rao was killed ?

1559
02:01:59,333 --> 02:02:04,458
Rumor in Palasa was that...they made sure 
Mohan rao's dead body couldn't be traced.

1560
02:02:04,458 --> 02:02:08,791
After Mohan rao was killed, 
SI sebastian did not keep quiet.

1561
02:02:09,416 --> 02:02:11,791
Devadas, who was an eye 
witness in Ranga's

1562
02:02:11,791 --> 02:02:14,333
murder turned in favour 
of Landlord for money.

1563
02:02:14,416 --> 02:02:16,916
Dandaasi and Gauri did 
not receive any justice.

1564
02:02:16,999 --> 02:02:21,708
After few visits to courts regarding 
the case..SI Sebastian got transferred.

1565
02:02:22,083 --> 02:02:25,083
*Breathes heavily*

1566
02:02:25,624 --> 02:02:26,833
Palasa changed a lot after that.

1567
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:30,791
Gurumurthy became very 
powerful in Politics,

1568
02:02:30,916 --> 02:02:33,083
Tekkali Padma became a MP.

1569
02:02:33,208 --> 02:02:37,458
Tarakesh used to represent 
the ruling party,contest

1570
02:02:37,499 --> 02:02:40,666
from Tekkali or 
Palasa and become an MLA.

1571
02:02:40,708 --> 02:02:46,708
They became powerful Financially and 
Socially but Ambusoli was destroyed.

1572
02:02:49,208 --> 02:02:52,708
An year ago Pollution Control 
Board brought in a G.O

1573
02:02:52,791 --> 02:02:55,833
Gurumurthy gave his word to rest 
of Landlords that he will get

1574
02:02:55,916 --> 02:02:59,083
them land allocated near Palasa for 
constructing Cashew factories.

1575
02:02:59,083 --> 02:03:03,708
Everyone knew that Gurumurthy will be 
receiving crores of rupees for this.

1576
02:03:05,208 --> 02:03:07,499
Uncle, we don't have so much land here

1577
02:03:07,583 --> 02:03:10,083
- We have Ambusoli. 
- Ambusoli ?

1578
02:03:10,291 --> 02:03:12,916
Why would they vacate 
it and give it to us ?

1579
02:03:13,083 --> 02:03:15,083
Do you think they would allow us there?

1580
02:03:15,583 --> 02:03:19,416
We will not go there. We 
will send Vaasu to that place.

1581
02:03:19,499 --> 02:03:22,999
Vaasu is their man, he is from their caste

1582
02:03:23,583 --> 02:03:29,999
You don't worry. There is no one 
now in Ambusoli to oppose us.

1583
02:03:30,208 --> 02:03:31,708
How do we deal with Vaasu ?

1584
02:03:31,999 --> 02:03:34,291
We will make him MLA.

1585
02:03:34,583 --> 02:03:38,583
You think they wouldn't be happy 
if someone from their caste

1586
02:03:38,708 --> 02:03:42,874
will become an MLA. We will nominate him 
from SC Quota to contest from Palasa

1587
02:03:42,999 --> 02:03:44,916
It is our responsibility to make him win.

1588
02:03:45,708 --> 02:03:50,916
Once he wins, it is his responsibilty 
to get entire Ambusoli vacated.

1589
02:03:51,066 --> 02:03:54,983
Vaasu warned Ambusoli villagers 
to vacate the place in 6 months.

1590
02:03:55,816 --> 02:03:58,899
He decided to submit 
nomination from SC Quota

1591
02:03:59,733 --> 02:04:02,733
Those landlords celebrated 
as they were getting

1592
02:04:02,941 --> 02:04:05,358
land at cheap cost 
of Cashew factories

1593
02:04:05,691 --> 02:04:07,816
Ganapavaasu had a long 
pending desire to perform

1594
02:04:07,858 --> 02:04:09,816
and potrayed Goddess Durga 
in the celebrations

1595
02:04:09,858 --> 02:04:12,274
inbetween all these he got murdered.

1596
02:04:12,316 --> 02:04:16,399
Sebastian killed Mohan rao but he is 
alive. Which statement is correct ?

1597
02:04:16,524 --> 02:04:17,399
(thunders)

1598
02:04:18,358 --> 02:04:19,649
You are watching breaking news...

1599
02:04:19,649 --> 02:04:22,358
Titli storm has taken a 
dangerous turn in bay of bengal

1600
02:04:22,441 --> 02:04:26,649
It is travelling at a speed of 
300 km/hr towards Kalingapatnam

1601
02:04:26,649 --> 02:04:30,941
Meterological department has warned 
that districts of Orissa,

1602
02:04:30,941 --> 02:04:35,108
North Andhra pradesh will see heavy 
rainfall and severe loss might occur

1603
02:04:35,483 --> 02:04:40,233
It's been 12 hours but Police 
couldn't find a single clue in the

1604
02:04:40,274 --> 02:04:45,233
brutal murder case of MLA Ganapavaasu 
of Palasa, Srikakulam District.

1605
02:04:45,233 --> 02:04:46,649
Old criminal Mohan rao...

1606
02:04:46,691 --> 02:04:50,108
You are sitting here leisurely and 
having a chat with retired policeman?

1607
02:04:50,524 --> 02:04:53,108
Who is the new SI ? Are you the one ?

1608
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:58,691
Mohan rao is the one who killed 
Ganapavaasu and kidnapped my uncle

1609
02:04:59,066 --> 02:05:02,066
See, they are telecasting 
in the news too.

1610
02:05:02,108 --> 02:05:03,941
Will you arrest him or not ?

1611
02:05:03,983 --> 02:05:05,566
We are investigating on that.

1612
02:05:05,649 --> 02:05:10,858
People say Mohan rao was killed in 
encounter. You are saying he is alive.

1613
02:05:12,483 --> 02:05:14,399
He is not dead. There is an eye witness.

1614
02:05:14,608 --> 02:05:19,316
Devadas, who was hit by him is still in 
the hospital, you can go and enquire him.

1615
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:22,899
Within an hour my uncle 
should be back at home.

1616
02:05:24,816 --> 02:05:30,024
Remember...i don't care if Police catches 
him or my men,i will kill him

1617
02:05:30,566 --> 02:05:33,608
This news has come out very 
lately...details say that

1618
02:05:33,608 --> 02:05:37,899
a girl from Vizayanagaram, 
belonging to an upper caste....

1619
02:05:38,983 --> 02:05:40,066
(Thunder storms)

1620
02:05:40,733 --> 02:05:42,941
Someone light the candles.

1621
02:05:44,441 --> 02:05:45,608
( Thunder storms)

1622
02:05:52,733 --> 02:05:57,441
I don't get it. You keep saying Mohan 
rao is dead, he says he is alive.

1623
02:05:57,441 --> 02:06:00,566
Where should i go and 
whom should i catch ?

1624
02:06:00,608 --> 02:06:05,483
(Mohan Rao)You don't need to go 
anywhere or catch anyone.

1625
02:06:11,941 --> 02:06:12,858
(thunders)

1626
02:06:15,108 --> 02:06:16,274
(raining heavily)

1627
02:06:19,441 --> 02:06:20,983
(ominous music playing)

1628
02:06:21,691 --> 02:06:22,983
This is the Chinna Shaavukaru....

1629
02:06:24,483 --> 02:06:26,191
This is Ganapavaasu.

1630
02:06:35,983 --> 02:06:38,566
Mohan rao, is that you ?

1631
02:06:39,149 --> 02:06:42,483
Are you alive ? what 
people are saying about you ?

1632
02:06:43,233 --> 02:06:44,899
I was telling him your 
story all this while.

1633
02:06:46,733 --> 02:06:50,733
It feels good to hear 
my story from you Sir

1634
02:06:52,066 --> 02:06:59,483
In your story Mohan Rao was dead..fact 
is i have been dead long ago

1635
02:07:00,774 --> 02:07:05,608
That day was like rebirth to 
me and death to Mohan rao

1636
02:07:05,608 --> 02:07:06,524
*scoffs*

1637
02:07:06,649 --> 02:07:09,649
Our birth is termed unfortunate and now 
our death should also be unfortunate ?

1638
02:07:09,691 --> 02:07:11,816
We were not killers by birth...

1639
02:07:11,858 --> 02:07:15,691
...we were born in a caste who 
performs dances infront of dieties.

1640
02:07:16,233 --> 02:07:17,941
We were not allowed into temples...

1641
02:07:18,733 --> 02:07:21,024
We were seated seperately in school...

1642
02:07:22,774 --> 02:07:24,691
We should neither enter their 
vicinity nor ask them for some water.

1643
02:07:25,566 --> 02:07:30,358
We lost hopes and that is when we realised 
we can survive only if we scare them.

1644
02:07:30,399 --> 02:07:34,066
Every person has a story , a struggle. 
Did everyone

1645
02:07:34,108 --> 02:07:37,524
who struggled in life 
turn out to be like you ?

1646
02:07:37,524 --> 02:07:39,733
The struggle you are 
talking about is not

1647
02:07:39,733 --> 02:07:42,066
comparable to the struggle 
what we go through.

1648
02:07:43,274 --> 02:07:45,858
Visit the homes of untouchables who 
are restricted only to outskirts and

1649
02:07:45,858 --> 02:07:48,274
hear their stories, you would then 
understand our stories and struggle.

1650
02:07:51,066 --> 02:07:52,358
I also come from a similar background...

1651
02:07:52,649 --> 02:07:55,149
...we had many more 
restrictions than you.

1652
02:07:55,316 --> 02:08:01,316
I was born into a family who used 
to clean shit of rich people

1653
02:08:01,608 --> 02:08:02,816
My parents were hired 
to clean the shit...

1654
02:08:03,108 --> 02:08:08,316
but my father joined me in school 
saying i would become strong if i study.

1655
02:08:08,441 --> 02:08:10,649
When i was sitting outside
