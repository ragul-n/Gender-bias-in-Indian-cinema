Why did you bring me?

Didn't bring but kidnapped you.

why;

8
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,256
Why do we eat biryani?

9
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,398
For strength!

10
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,897
“ﬂay do we kidnap?

11
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,034
For money!

12
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,601
Unable to get the call through.

13
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,734
Till the man who engaged us
to kidnap you comes here,

14
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,309
please tell your story
to pass the time.

15
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,908
I'll tell if you give me phone.

16
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,242
You want phone?
Don't you want police station address?

17
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,878
Take it.

18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,412
But don't make any call.

19
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,812
No SMS too.

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,991
He came t0 my home 3 months <i>ago...</i>

21
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,290
I thought he loves me.

22
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,557
I eloped with him.

23
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,064
But now he says he came
for his mother.

24
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,001
For mother?

25
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,067
Have tea.

26
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,508
Tell clearly.

27
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,913
This story started in Milan
3 months <i>ago...</i>

28
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,253
Where is it?

29
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,125
Italy!

30
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,491
Where is that?

31
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,900
Europe!

32
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,124
Where is that?

33
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,531
Do you want geography of
the place or my history?

34
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,702
Tell me.

35
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,810
There's a super rich family
known as Nandas!

36
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,485
There's an old man known as Raghunandan
in the 11 th ﬂoor of that oﬂice.

37
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,410
Did you love him?
- I loved his grandson!

38
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,174
Is he rich?

39
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,903
Rs. 1 lakh crates!

40
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,415
One lakh crates?!

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,476
How many zeroes?

42
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,417
You'll settle in life
if I sell his wrist watch, okay?

43
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,248
That's why he's so proud.

44
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,755
Do you remember ISF?

45
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,588
That's investment fund, right?

46
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,060
It holds 7% of shares
in our company.

47
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,823
<i>A man known as PnveenNﬂh
has bought it.</i>

48
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,729
What does he want?

49
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,603
That chair, father!

50
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,701
Tell him to buy spending 60 Euros.

51
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,343
He's buying our shares spending
1 00 millions.

52
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,208
Threatening, those who refuse to sell.

53
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,347
To tell the truth,
he's stooping down to hooliganism.

54
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:37,955
Whatever he may do, our family
holds 60% shares in this company.

55
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,290
40% only, father.
20% belongs to your daughter Sunanda.

56
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:46,086
She didn't any attend board
meeting in 25 'years.

57
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,094
Didn't claim ownership.

58
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,867
That's why he started
buying our shares.

59
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,929
Talk to him.

60
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,433
He owns a yacht,

61
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,975
he lives in it, neither he picks
calls nor attends meeting.

62
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,745
How do we catch him?

63
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,746
How is he getting our details?

64
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,921
To let in fresh air,
we open doors, father.

65
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,216
Dust too enters along with it.

66
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,517
Why don't you tell Gautham?

67
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,394
So many of us couldn't do anything,
what can a lone man do?

68
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,294
Hey, bullet is just half an inch!

69
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,600
But it kills a six foot man!

70
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,299
How would it be if the bullet
is six foot tall?

71
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,938
My grandson Gautham Nanda
would be like that!

72
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,340
<i>Raghu, not...</i>

73
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,070
Do you think it's great
to kidnap me from my boat?

74
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,745
Do you think it's great to buy
my company's shares clandestinely?

75
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,643
You can get energy if you eat
the apple on your table.

76
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,515
But if you try to steal
anothefs apple,

77
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,089
look, you've to be brought
here by force.

78
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,524
May I ask you a question?

79
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,018
What do you get buying my company?

80
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,686
Happiness.

81
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,504
This is fear!

82
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,872
This is pain!

83
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,476
How would happiness be?

84
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,135
Find it.

85
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,642
Is it in money?
Is it in clubs with girls?

86
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,046
Or is it in the soap the girls use?

87
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,211
Till you ﬁnd it,
don't ever dare look at us.

88
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,718
There's a chance you may find
happiness if you go searching.

89
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,929
If I kill you,
no one can ﬁnd your body too.

90
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,542
Don't playwith mane of lion
because it is sleeping,

91
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,812
likewise get yourself photographed
with lion because it's friendly.

92
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,101
Did you ask him,
what happiness is?

93
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,771
Do you know what my happiness is?

94
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,093
All these chairs must be ﬁlled.

95
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:33,268
With my daughter, son-in-law
and grand daughters.

96
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,403
This room must get ﬁlled
with their laughter.

97
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,636
Then, my heart would he
ﬁlled with happiness.

98
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,645
In 3 months, I would be 80!

99
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:56,820
I used to get you a gift for you
on your every birthday.

100
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,429
Will you get me a gift this time?

101
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,561
Will you bring your aunt here?

102
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,894
Will you get up?

103
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,637
You've been restricted to
a wheel chair for 2 years now.

104
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,677
Will you get up from it?

105
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,580
You can't get up,
he too can't bring thern here.

106
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,512
You sent them away,
why are you shouting on us now?

107
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,820
Yes, I got angry since she married
against my wishes,

108
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:30,858
I sent them away,

109
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,393
now I want them back.

110
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,167
You've been thinking about her
for 25 'years,

111
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,927
did she ever call you at least once?

112
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,230
She's a woman, she'll have pride.

113
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,931
I'm your son, father,
I too have anger.

114
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:50,610
We came here leaving motherland
to make him forget about her.

115
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,074
Where else can i take him
s0 that she'll leave him alone?

116
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,276
Father. . . father...

117
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,491
Father, like we're facing a problem,
a village got ﬂooded,

118
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,989
a man started swimming to other hank
with his wife and children,

119
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,698
unable to carry the weight,
he dumped his wife,

120
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,133
then dumped his daughter,

121
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,969
lastly he dumped his son too,

122
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,143
he reached the shore alone,

123
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,811
hut all his life, he thought of the
three people he dumped,

124
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:27,976
and spent his life in tears.

125
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,985
Whether it is luck 0r not,
we're still carrying him,

126
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,786
shall we dump him midway?

127
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,260
Or shall we carry the distance with
diﬂiculty and live happily thereafter?

128
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,924
She won't come, it's your madness,
she'll not come.

129
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:54,274
Every year we send clothes,
jewels and ﬂowers on her birthday,

130
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,011
they come back to us
withered and crumpled.

131
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,508
He shuts himself in his room
for l0 days.

132
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:06,955
Banging his door continuously,
my hands and heart have become hard.

133
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,254
We don't need her.

134
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,963
No need to think of her.

135
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:40,217
I got up!
I'm standing!

136
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:51,233
Will you bring your aunt here?

137
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,740
In search ofcloud that
has migrated from

138
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:09,751
The sky itself is going
to foreign...

139
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:15,286
In search of the rain drop
that fell from the <i>peak...</i>

140
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:24,492
It has left residence
to go into exile...

141
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,943
Is he mighty, archer, thunder
or a demon?

142
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,910
He's a man ofsteel...

143
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,549
He's powerful lightning...

144
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,887
Is he protector or defender or
is he expert to test ﬁre itself?

145
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,218
A strange war without an enemy...

146
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,553
A wound hurt down deep in heart...

147
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,197
A walking courage...

148
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,134
An epitome of bravery...

149
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,472
A tough heart to take any poison...

150
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:13,815
He's a six feet bullet...
He's a rocket ﬁred by courage...

151
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:50,509
He's the sound ofsilence of
rays of ﬁre that engulfs the world...

152
00:16:52,177 --> 00:17:00,824
He's the unseen hailstorm
that lashes the earth...

153
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,727
He's the fury ofrough sea
hidden inside a conch...

154
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:11,204
He's Ashoka to overcome sorrows...

155
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:53,581
I-Ie shows the place of origin to the
branches that left roots to grow...

156
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:03,816
I-Ie shows east to the Sun which changes
direction to set in west...

157
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:09,927
Is he Ravana or Rama or
Krishna to win over hearts...

158
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,662
Is he a soldier orworker
or a man to do impossible...

159
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,796
This is Hyderabad, sir.

160
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,333
Traﬂic is too bad,
Goddess Peddamma Talli is famous god.

161
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,131
Sir, she's your aunt Sunanda.

162
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,039
She was thin earlier
but now little fat and strong.

163
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,113
He's your uncle Rajashekar.

164
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:36,008
He had curly hair,
got rich and lost the curls.

165
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,848
They used to have a 3 star hotel,

166
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,116
now they've a 5 star hotel,
which is running into loses,

167
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,887
your uncle is lawyer in court,
your aunt is the judge in home,

168
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,293
they have two brothers
and two wives.

169
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,294
I mean each have one wife.

170
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,103
Tell me about my aunt
not about useless things.

171
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,900
Without knowing these details,
how can you plan and take aunt home?

172
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,634
Rama planned to build a bridge
after reaching sea,

173
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,870
he didn't plan a bridge in forest
before coming to sea.

174
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,072
I didn't mean like that sir.
- Will you please keep shut?

175
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,409
<i>Yo: good...</i>

176
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,321
Why not just put a plaster
to his mouth?

177
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,090
Sorry boss, didn't get that idea.

178
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,384
Did you get hurt, Balu?
- No problem, sir.

179
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,023
He says no problem,
what if anyone attacks me?

180
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,559
That's okay, where's uncle's house?

181
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,929
It's in Jubilee Hills,
but he's no in that bus.

182
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,503
That bus?

183
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,199
He's returning from Chennai.

184
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,843
Where are you going, sir?
- To follow.

185
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,104
Then?

186
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:40,080
Did I write any book on
'I-Iow to bring Aunt home'?

187
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,185
Just do whatever you feel like doing.

188
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,781
Is there anyone to receive us or not?

189
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,787
A new batch is waiting for us, sir.
- Corrie.- Come.

190
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,885
I want a car urgently.
- Can"?

191
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,094
Thafs my car!
- How much?

192
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,931
Is it taxi to ask about fare?
- Whafs the price?

193
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,259
Rs.70 lakhs!

194
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,567
<i>Give it to him, Ed“.</i>

195
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:34,661
Whafs this man?

196
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,102
Take American Express cheque
that's equal to cash.

197
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,673
Would I give car if you pay cash?

198
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,503
Should we give a warning too?

199
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,557
What happened;

200
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,700
I think he's having an heart attack,
need to take him to hospital immediately.

201
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,835
A small suggestion.
- What?

202
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,904
He'll die in 5 minutes, after that
your aunt would become a widow, right?

203
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,566
It's very easy to convince
a widow and take her home.

204
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,798
Rajarathnarn, I need little time
to settle your loan.

205
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,457
Would 50 years be enough, madam?

206
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:16,305
I too have eyes,
I too can see angrily.

207
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,696
Be on the job.

208
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:25,748
'VVhen you sought loan,
I want lo crores and 25 crores,

209
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,975
you speak very well
in chaste Telugu,

210
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,153
when I ask you to repay,
you start speaking in English.

211
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,185
You build this hotel with my money.

212
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,415
Theywant us also to pay bill
for a coffee here.

213
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,785
They'll not repay the loan.

214
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,860
Madam, your husband is
in James Hospital.

215
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,325
He had an heart attack.

216
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,700
Am I narrating Benhur ﬁlm
as a ballad?

217
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,599
Why am I talking alone?

218
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:54,866
Jesus! Why should I lend money
and get hurt?

219
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,614
When good people are hurt, they cry.

220
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,376
When bad people like me are hurt,
they'll make others cry.

221
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:05,183
I'll wait for the time she has
no kerchief and make her cry.

222
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,920
There's much better hospital
5 kms away from here,

223
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,420
why didn't you take him there?

224
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,426
Cemetery is just 2 kms away only.

225
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,629
Had he delayed by few minutes,
you'd have gone there.

226
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,787
He brought him here at right time.

227
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,348
I expected she would
thank you profoundly,

228
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,383
but why is she holding collar
and scolding you?

229
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,188
If she's a person to pause
for a moment and think,

230
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,846
why would we come this far, Balu?

231
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,697
How are you now?

232
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,232
The man who brought me <i>here...</i>

233
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:32,634
Madam!

234
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,738
Tell driver to bring
my briefcase from car.

235
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,709
Give a lakh to that man.
- Okay madam.

236
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,811
You gave up billions to live with me.

237
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,017
But the man who is responsible
for my living now,

238
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,283
can money equate it, Nandu?

239
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,024
Hello, madam is calling you.

240
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,302
Keep the phone on, you'd know
what I'm talking to them inside.

241
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,412
Don't be sleepy, be alert.
- Okay sir.

242
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,919
Your name?

243
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,555
SiddharthmSiddu!

244
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,725
What do you do?

245
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,431
Call the ambulance driver.

246
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:30,459
Driver, sir.

247
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,362
Whafs a driver doing in airport?

248
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,505
That <i>is...</i>
- My ﬁancﬁ is in Dubai.

249
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,806
I was working in Dubai,
just now came to India.

250
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,101
Did you come for short period
or for good?

251
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:48,009
Actually, there was a ﬁre
accident in the place I work,

252
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,983
actually I saved my boss Sheikh,
his wife and kids.

253
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,555
If you save anyone,
you must get a raise in pay,

254
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,124
why would anyone fire you?

255
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,757
Actually according to Dubai rules,
since I saw their women,

256
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,399
they said sorry and sent me away
spending as much money as possible.

257
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,468
ﬁring me as their driver
and send me away.

258
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:10,003
Without bothering about money,
send the driver away.

259
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,163
“ﬂay are you telling this
so many times?

260
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,900
To make us understand.

261
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,704
If you deliver this suitcase,
what would you get?

262
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,282
What else? I‘ll get salary this month
also as I get every month.

263
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,851
<i>H you give it to us,
you“ get a 70 hkhwoﬂh c“.</i>

264
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,147
<i>why are you thinking!?</i>

265
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,312
You're talking
but not giving the keys.

266
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,150
Take it.

267
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:29,750
Take it.

268
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,890
Why did you bring it?
What happened to the driver?

269
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,553
He left the job.
- Why?

270
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,462
He said he would buy a 70 lakh car
but not work for you.

271
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,229
By the way, who are you?
- Patient of that bed.

272
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,003
Sir, you can‘t have children anymore.
- I know.

273
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,506
I think he left the job for you.

274
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,045
If you don't have any objection,
you can join us as driver.

275
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,680
I'm in difiiculties losing my job,
why would I've any objections, sir?

276
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,388
Ifyou're in difiiculties,
it's like Arnbani is begging.

277
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,861
Appointing him without knowing
his credentials...

278
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,501
You're damn lucky!
Whafs your salary expectation?

279
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:24,875
To pay him, your entire family
must rob a bank.

280
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,711
Day after tomorrow is
auspicious day, join the duty.

281
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,216
Okay sir.
- Come.

282
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,380
Bye, Sir.

283
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:18,724
Like waves of fragrance of
millions of ﬂower ﬁlling the <i>air...</i>

284
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:25,431
He moved like breeze with smile...

285
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:32,375
To move stones with the
wetness ofwannth...

286
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:39,284
He came down like the
benevolent rain God...

287
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,721
He's sky, a never ending void...

288
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,090
Melting clouds are his domain...

289
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,528
He's the one who burns
down the differences...

290
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,827
His eyes are illuminating the world...

291
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:59,465
Protecting relationships
and lives are his forte...

292
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,277
“ﬂay are you watching so intently?

293
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,010
They dance for us, right?
- Is it?

294
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,213
Bend your headmbend!

295
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,714
I'll pluck out your eyes.

296
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,849
Ifyou're so possessive,
don't have daughters.

297
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,646
If you do, then don't teach
them to dance.

298
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,450
If they show it is glamour,
if we see it's vulgar.

299
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,854
People are taking our lives.
- Am I?

300
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,667
Whafs this?

301
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,966
This is a home with girls,
why are you taking so much liberty?

302
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,665
Be careful.

303
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,709
<i>You chide “kc this and get he:
married to some sadist Rom “T .</i>

304
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,214
He'll use all his intelligence
to torture them.

305
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:14,975
You'll know then.

306
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,812
Who is he?
- He‘s...

307
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,250
Why are you shaking hands with driver?
Leave her hand.

308
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,323
You come, madam.

309
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,059
Your dance very nicely.

310
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,357
Your eye brows were like
reverse Nike symbol,

311
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,696
you moved it fantastically
up and down!

312
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,236
Are you really a driver?

313
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,705
<i>I'm...</i>
- He's returned from Dubai, come sir.

314
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,639
You go.
- This way. . . this way...

315
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,740
Enough of seeing her.

316
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,812
I'm telling you,
9 to 5 is your duty hours,

317
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,039
Saturdays and Sundays are holidays,

318
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,241
no holidays for festivals
and no bonus too.

319
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,717
When madam presses this bell twice,
you must come immediately.

320
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,288
If she presses the third time?
- Another driver will come in your place.

321
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,063
Can't you see a man falling down?

322
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,101
Why should you shake hands
with a driver?

323
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,402
<i>You...</i>

324
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,265
You won't long last.

325
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,963
Really? Let me see!

326
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,472
Who is he?
- New driver.

327
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,606
Is it you who took my brother
to hospital?

328
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:25,450
He doesn't look like a driver.
- Use him for household work too.

329
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,213
Whafs the priest doing here?

330
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,223
Women have taken a vow to offer
prayer if brother comes home safely.

331
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,021
Give the list to me.

332
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,422
Incense sticks?
- Got it.

333
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,067
Flowers?
- Keeping it there.

334
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,634
Camphor?
- Got a kilo!

335
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,135
Betel leaves?
- Ready.

336
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,136
Coconuts?
- In store room.

337
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,297
“ﬂay are you looking at me?
Am I so handsome?

338
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,138
No...he said coconuts are
in room, get it.

339
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,179
“ﬂay are you looking perplexed?
Didn't get me?

340
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,474
“ﬂay are you still here?
Go!

341
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,052
Oil, nine grains, ﬂower garlands,
well made list.

342
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,151
Don't know whatever I eat
gets stocked here!

343
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:18,666
What happened;

344
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,366
Who is he?
How could he enter my room?

345
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,442
Who asked you to enter her room?

346
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,773
You told me to get coconuts
from upstairs...

347
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,472
Coconuts are in store room.

348
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,674
He pointed the ﬁnger <i>up...</i>

349
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,377
Pointed up <i>?</i>
Will you go wherever I point?

350
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,749
I would show up for god,
will you go up there also?

351
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,517
Why are you making it a big issue?

352
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,024
Shameless girl!

353
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,326
He made the mistake,
why should I be ashamed?

354
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,662
Why did you do like that?
You appear to be a good man.

355
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:47,197
I didn't know putting zip is
such a grave mistake, madam.

356
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:51,699
If I hurt you so much...
I can correct it immediately.

357
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,103
How;
_ How?

358
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,468
Like this!

359
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,175
Will you zip up and
down madam's dress?

360
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,713
Is she a mannequin in shop?

361
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,078
What happened?
- What am I to tell sir?

362
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,878
Your second daughter Sashi's dress,
he zipped and unzipped...

363
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,113
I can't tell that, sir.

364
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,089
He doesn’t know
where the coconuts are?

365
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,123
He knows where my heart is, right?

366
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,792
There are girls in this house,
how could you behave like this?

367
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,628
Remove him.
- Whafs this trouble in prayers?

368
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:18,460
Thafs it, sir.

369
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:22,594
Whatever you may think,
he‘s not right for this home.

370
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,735
She's the one to decide
what's right or wrong to this home.

371
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,150
Fill up the tank.

372
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,897
It's like bringing home a snake.

373
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:51,726
What can we do?

374
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,062
You are")
- Nurse!

375
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,066
Nurse?

376
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,600
I expected a lady as nurse.

377
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,035
Ladies are becoming expecting mothers,
so I'm here.

378
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,372
Are you disappointed?
- No, nothing like that.

379
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,685
It's like a heroine taking bath in oil
and coming out without wiping it.

380
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:11,718
Use olive oil.

381
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,117
For lunch make omelettes
with egg whites only.

382
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,724
Add milk with spinach,
it's good for heart.

383
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,690
Okay, what should I cook for you?

384
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,521
That list was for me.

385
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,162
How would I know what patienfs
requirement is?

386
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,525
Please ask him.

387
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,673
Why are you giving pose like Pedarayudu?

388
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,978
Do you consider yourself
a big business magnate?

389
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,148
Why are you acting like a billionaire?

390
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,317
Why is he silent?

391
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,483
You don't have the
body language of a driver.

392
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,679
Do you know that?

393
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,019
Drivers used caps like this
in 1960's, sir.

394
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,228
In 1980's caps disappeared.

395
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,631
Now they put caps on owners
and drive the cars.

396
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,136
Are they item girls to show bodies?

397
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,671
Where's the body language?

398
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,342
I've planned that too, sir.

399
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,108
NTR as driver in film 'Taxi Rarnudu'!

400
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,543
<i>Get in...</i>

401
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,186
I'll tell you the story on the way, come...

402
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,014
ANR in the ﬁlm ‘Donga Ramudu’.

403
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,187
Drop the kids in school.

404
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,291
Driver is new, show him the way.

405
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,562
Who will pay the taxi fare?
Would your father pay?

406
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,707
You're a driver,
show some respect.

407
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,005
Who is he?

408
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,075
He's Chiranjeevi.
- He's doing it very well.

409
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,941
He's not acting anymore, sir.
- Why?

410
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,274
His son is acting now.

411
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,044
What are you doing then?

412
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,044
I'll mix all this and fix it.

413
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,546
You get me ice pack.

414
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:56,386
Any progress in aunt's matter, sir

415
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,719
Very good.

416
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,860
If my uncle comes home drunk
every night and beats her,

417
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,589
she would cry for leaving her family,

418
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:04,926
but the matter here isn't that,

419
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,133
they've made her sit on
a golden throne!

420
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,498
Bloody progress!

421
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,767
Whywould aunt or uncle come
if you act like driver or cleaner?

422
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:14,739
They won't come.

423
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,914
Do you've any idea?

424
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,418
Don't criticize without an alternative.

425
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,554
They'll get angﬂ"

426
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,713
My uncle isn't keeping good health,

427
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,415
if he knows the reason of
my coming here,

428
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,719
won't he kick the bucket in shock?

429
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:32,986
I'm sure he would.

430
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,823
Is my relationship with aunt any good?
It's worse!

431
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,330
Won't she throw me out
if I tell her?

432
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,432
She'll surely.

433
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,227
I must tell her at
an opportune time, right?

434
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,528
You must tell at right time.

435
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,194
To tell her, I must he in
their home, right?

436
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,532
You must, sir.

437
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,505
To stay there, other than as driver,
what else can I do?

438
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,544
Nobody can do anything,
you've to be a driver.

439
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:51,805
Tell that to him.

440
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,882
There's no truth in it.

441
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,245
I swear sir.

442
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,282
There's no feeling in your praise.
- How can it be, sir?

443
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,286
Only fear rules in
situations like this, sir.

444
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,220
If you pass comments on people
who pay you salaries,

445
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,860
your live will turn
upside down, bloody idiot!

446
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,518
Got it?
- Got it, sir.

447
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,924
Get the fool down.

448
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:13,563
I'm like a knife, i can cut
vegetables as well as necks.

449
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,570
I don't have emotions, only duty!

450
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,197
This dialogue isn't matching
this scene, sir.

451
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,138
Does Mephistopheles beard suit you?

452
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,505
Are we not tolerating it?
Shut your gob and listen.

453
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,619
Sir, this is your daughter's
Harvard application form.

454
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,493
These are bank account
statement details.

455
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,032
This is scholarship form.

456
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,601
I need lo latest photos of
your daughter, sir.

457
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,498
Is it okay to give like this, father?

458
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,939
Why are you getting tensed?

459
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:58,509
I didn't commit any murder.
Iust got married. That's all!

460
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:04,614
Father, he's Shekar,
he did blaster of Law.

461
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,853
He said he would die
if I don't marry him.

462
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,185
I threatened him that
you would die if you marry me.

463
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,854
<i>He didn't get scared.</i>

464
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,857
He asked I'm an ordinary advocate,

465
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,831
would your rich family accept
me as their son-in-law?

466
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,492
I told him my father too came
from ordinary family.

467
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,195
My father loves me dearly.

468
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,167
I told him my father wouldn't
say no to me.

469
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,809
He would watch like fool
whatever I do,

470
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,975
I don't give him a damn,

471
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,975
if you want, see it,
did you marry to show him this?

472
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:36,583
Father, that <i>is...</i>

473
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,379
I hugged you when you cried,

474
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,385
but if you go against,
I'll rip you apart.

475
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:45,453
Just got married...
just got married?

476
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,025
I'm planning to send you to Harvard.

477
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,297
Why did you make me stand here?

478
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,897
I wanted to make you sit next
to me in board meetings.

479
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,207
But you tonsured my head cleanly.

480
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:04,903
I'm conducting a sacrifice
for your well being,

481
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,671
and you're taking my life here.

482
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:07,576
Father!

483
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,081
Who is your father?

484
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,518
I hoped you wouldn't say a word
if I married him.

485
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:19,251
If you really had trust on me,
you shouldn't have come after marriage,

486
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,995
you shoulcfve come to me
with him before that,

487
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,688
you shoulcfve sought my permission,

488
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,599
I'll not accept,
you must make a plea,

489
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:31,062
it'll take a year,
2...nlay take 4 or 5 'years also.

490
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,808
You must wait till then,
and then marry him.

491
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,370
That's what you shoulcfve done
if you really had trust on me.

492
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,549
Didn‘t you ﬁnd anyone
better than him?

493
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:46,051
He can‘t even be an assistant
to a junior lawyer in my oﬂice.

494
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,621
Father, look from my side.

495
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:55,824
I can see future with him,
I can see a family!

496
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,329
I can see your ruination!

497
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,398
Why don't you please listen
to her, Raghu?

498
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,731
I-Ie too is advising me
because of you.

499
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,136
Go!

500
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,882
Go,,,go...go away!

501
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,987
What are you looking at? G0 away!

502
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:24,921
Go!

503
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,625
Go!

504
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:30,261
I wanted to you to share my wealth
equally with my son,

505
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,867
you removed me like a speck of dust,

506
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,133
Whafs this, father?
- Stop it.

507
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,104
I mustn't hear her footsteps
in this house.

508
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,903
I mustn't see her smile
on these walls.

509
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,014
Nothing she likes or her clothes,

510
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,949
her connection with this family,

511
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,220
her right to he heir of this family,

512
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,016
her blood relationship
with this family,

513
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,320
nothing must remain!

514
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,223
Remove it!

515
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,315
Sir, dust!
- No problem, Balu.

516
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,526
Looks like that male nurse has seen it,
what am I to tell him?

517
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,858
Let's tell him the truth.

518
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:37,931
He would understand it.
Whafs in it?

519
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,728
I can understand Telugu
very well, tell me.

520
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:45,934
Nothing, I'm not a driver
but Sunandds nephew,

521
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,073
we own many steel factories in Spain,

522
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,373
I'm here to convince my aunt and
take her to my grandfather.

523
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,106
You like her elder daughter Premila,

524
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,511
if she says yes,
you'd marry her too, right?

525
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,447
Am I right?

526
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,247
Thafs it.
- How could you?

527
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,953
Because I'm also a billionaire like you.

528
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,591
I sell plastics in France.

529
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,160
I've joined as nurse there to marry
their younger daughter Sashi.

530
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,161
Wow! What a coincidence!
- What?

531
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,163
I mean coincidence!

532
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,996
That's why steel and plastic
have mixed so well.

533
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,570
I'll beat you with slippers.

534
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,639
You'd have missed your bus,
he would've given you lift,

535
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,401
door would've got stuck,
he would've opened it for you,

536
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,442
seeing dust on your pant,
he would've dusted it.

537
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,139
For that why to lie about steel factories
in Spain and Sunandds relative.

538
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,282
I'll get angfy”

539
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,715
I'm telling you,
you own this car,

540
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,114
you're their driver,

541
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,721
what I say is ﬁnal!

542
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,879
Why are you dressed like
marriage band?

543
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,686
Change it,
I'm getting irritated.

544
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,429
Why did he brush it off
as marriage band?

545
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:47,526
Did you get it now? The world never
believes if you tell the truth.

546
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,734
Be brave, I'll go to work.
- Okay sir.

547
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,216
Sorry, it happened unwittingly.

548
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:11,155
Actually Murthy, accountant Murthy,
he guided me wrongly,

549
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,487
it happened like that,

550
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,153
I'm really sorry.

551
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:17,927
You?

552
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,761
Siddu, your driver.

553
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,264
Look Siddu!

554
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,838
If that chair hurts my leg,

555
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,113
taking a photo of the chair,
keeping it in my bedroom,

556
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,943
would I decide to take
revenge on it?

557
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,383
Why would we get angry on chairs?

558
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,281
Is
lit it?

559
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,180
You too are like that to me.

560
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:46,295
“ﬂay would I get into trouble with
chairs, sofas, drivers and servants?

561
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,923
Go...go, mind your business.

562
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:02,434
Aunty, geyser isn't working.
- I know.

563
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,034
why;

564
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,646
No power.

565
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,872
I want hot water.

566
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,813
I'm in bath towel, send it up.

567
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,987
I'm working, I can't come now.

568
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,017
I'll not accept if you don't bring it.

569
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,626
Your husband will get it for you.

570
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,494
If I had husband,
he'll not only bring water,

571
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,191
he would apply soap to me also.

572
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,265
Send it up!

573
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,532
Why did you come here?

574
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,576
Bucket was lying downstairs.

575
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,844
Ifso, would you bring it?

576
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,046
They told me to do any job
on joining day, right?

577
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,150
Thafs why!

578
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,676
Would you murder if asked to?

579
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,348
What can be more comfortable
than murdering in a lawyeﬂs home?

580
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,722
Aren't you ashamed to enter
a lady's bathroom?

581
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,159
Look at that bulb!
How it is ogling at you!

582
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,499
Would you stop taking bath
because that bulb is seeing?

583
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,029
Bulbs, insects and drivers like me,

584
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,003
you mustn't bother about them,

585
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,700
without bothering about them,
take a good bath.

586
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,144
I'll wait here only, if you want
I'll get another bucket.

587
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,145
Are you daring to take on me?

588
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,878
I'll get you thrown out
from here in a week.

589
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,919
Many make great effort to make
others laugh with their jokes,

590
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,651
but when you get angry,
you make me laugh out loud!

591
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,690
Are you making me laughing stock?

592
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,262
I'm not afraid, I'll take bath.

593
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,765
But I don't see men taking bath.

594
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,171
How could you get a heart attack?

595
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:42,900
You take good care ofyourself.

596
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,906
What happened really?

597
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:50,651
That day after I had lunch,
I was feeling little uneasy,

598
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,648
moreover ﬂight journey,

599
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:57,887
feeling chest pain, I thought
it could he gastric trouble,

600
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,454
after getting down,
I had Eno salt,

601
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:07,094
when I was driving, there was
a severe pain in my left hand,

602
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,660
I understood,

603
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,764
I felt I'm ﬁnished,

604
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:15,939
I wanted to open the door,
I wanted to open the lock but...

605
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,609
I felt if someone had come
to my help.

606
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,015
But I couldn't do anything.

607
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,011
Then, he came at the right moment.

608
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:33,188
Breaking the window and taking to
hospital is like a dream to me,

609
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,763
my wife, my children,

610
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:37,930
my brothers,

611
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,122
their children,

612
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,564
all are very young,

613
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,165
not one of them is married,

614
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,403
only that was in my mind,

615
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,309
strength of a thread is
known only when it snaps,

616
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,553
value of relationships are
realised only when we leave,

617
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:01,955
it's true,

618
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:06,717
not just for me,
he came for my entire family,

619
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,158
What else can I tell other than this?

620
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,698
Had my mother been alive,
she would've built a temple for you.

621
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:23,171
What would your family have
done in this situation?

622
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:31,343
I don't have anyone,
they're all dead and gone.

623
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:05,553
If you go out,
get me two cigarettes.

624
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,755
Buy few beedies too.

625
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,913
What?
- Buy beedies, don't feel shy.

626
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,683
Beedies?

627
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,292
You too get cigarettes.

628
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:16,161
Why are you beating me?
- Should I get you cigarettes?

629
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,596
D o you know with whom
you're talking to?

630
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,200
You're not worth even
to wipe my shoes.

631
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,769
Should I get you cigarettes?
Comemcome out!

632
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:25,236
Comemcome...
- I asked you ﬁiendly.

633
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,403
Please listen to me.

634
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:27,803
Did you see that coffee shop?
- I've seen it.

635
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,306
Did you see it yesterday?
- No.

636
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,312
I don't know what coffee I would've,
American, filter or anything.

637
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,574
It was opened for my sake only.
- Is it?

638
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:35,375
For me only!

639
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,143
How dare you ask me to
get cigarettes!

640
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,150
Will you buy beedies for me?

641
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,181
Come here.

642
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:41,815
Did you see that shop here yesterday?

643
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:42,748
No!

644
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:45,257
If they ask for vegetables or coconuts,
I don't know to shop,

645
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,894
so this shop is being run
for me only.

646
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,688
They'll keep everything
packed and ready.

647
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,332
What did you ask me to do get now?
Buy cigarettes for you.

648
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,264
If I get cigarettes for you,
will you gift beedies to me?

649
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,337
Come here,
did you cans in his hands?

650
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,635
Did you see?

651
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,567
One has diesel and
another has petrol,

652
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,403
I don't know what to ﬁll
in which car,

653
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,772
when I apply the brake,
they'll come and ﬁll it up,

654
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,346
they'll ﬁll up the tank,
what did you ask me?

655
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,608
Should I buy cigarettes for you?
Cigarettes?

656
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,480
So many are working for me
to keep me a driver,

657
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:12,949
are you telling me to work for you?

658
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,522
Already they say we're dead.
- Is it?

659
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,750
How would an extra large sixed
man feel in small size?

660
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:18,517
I don't know.
- Show him.

661
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,923
Why is coming behind me?
Whafs he going to do?

662
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,563
I'm getting suffocated!

663
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,097
I'm also feeling the same.

664
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,859
Should I buy you cigarettes?

665
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:30,737
Why are you heating him, sir?
Ask them to heat him.

666
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:38,740
Sorry, sir!
I thought you were joking.

667
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,041
Are you my brother-in-law to joke?
- No sir.

668
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,618
Compared to my earlier days,
I'm cooler now, right?

669
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,689
You're much better compared
to early, sir.

670
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,325
You've calmed down.

671
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:55,289
Right, I too noticed it.

672
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,221
Pay and send him.

673
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,961
Give it all.

674
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,338
Sir, Rs. 10 lakhs,
he can't handle it.

675
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,918
Whafs the number, brother?

676
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,580
You were right, Balu.
He can‘t handle too much money.

677
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,626
Ifanyone give Rs. 10 lakhs,
break it open and take it,

678
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,229
why are you asking the number?

679
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,727
Hey, luck is knocking your door!

680
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,236
But bad luck is ﬁrmly locked
inside your home.

681
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:41,069
So, manage with this Rs. 1000 for now.

682
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,777
Eniov!
<i>_</i> Enjoy?

683
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,375
Bye...bye---

684
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,281
<i>I don't want, mummy.</i>

685
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,196
Where are you going?

686
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,467
I told you about Wednesday party, right?

687
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,315
The line mustn't be seen.

688
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:29,417
<i>can</i> I <i>wipe it, mummy?</i>

689
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,751
I'll kill you.

690
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:35,786
If I mean shouldn't seen,
wear a dress covering it.

691
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:36,993
Go!

692
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:39,623
Go!

693
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,601
Playing fool with me.

694
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,437
Siddu, we need to go out.

695
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,243
Where to?

696
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,843
Oh my God! Are you going to a party?
- Yes.

697
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,914
But you promised to go by evening.

698
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,247
Mother asked us to change the dress.
We got late.

699
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,819
I've been waiting here for you
since long time.

700
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,005
Madam, if you don't mind,
can I say something?

701
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,535
I'm ﬁnding it diﬂicult to hold it.

702
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,039
You're going to a partywith
such long dresses,

703
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,273
what a traditional family yours is!

704
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,307
We can hardly ﬁnd anyone like this.

705
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,144
I'm really very proud, madam.

706
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,650
To get associated with your family,

707
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,982
it's the good deeds of my early life to
get associated with a family like yours.

708
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,795
See on the left side!

709
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,968
Mother goes regularly that side
to reach her club.

710
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:51,696
Is <i>it, madam?</i>

711
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,739
Look on the right side...

712
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,171
Look at that coffee <i>shop...</i>

713
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,276
Sister loves to have coffee there only.

714
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,414
That's on my daddy's oﬂice route.
- Yes madam.

715
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,242
If you go that side,
we'll reach our hotel.

716
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,075
This too.

717
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,776
Can you the building on left side?
I learn to play piano there.

718
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,094
Did you change dress while
telling me address?

719
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,532
Are you disappointed in missing it?

720
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,433
Why are you inciting him?

721
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,005
Siddu, have your dinner
and wait for us.

722
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:28,942
Go...go...

723
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:17,484

724
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,962
Sashi...s0mewhere here only...

725
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,289
I'm Sashi!

726
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,892
Poor man may be here for us.

727
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,194
He won't come in the way
unless he gets ragged.

728
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:33,431
The Sashi I'm searching will
be half of you.

729
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,772
Am I so fat?

730
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,971
I was saying about height.

731
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,342
How am I?

732
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,349
Very good.

733
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,277
You're beautiful too.

734
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,083
You're sexy too.

735
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,520
Whafs your name?

736
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,163
Did we meet before?

737
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,799
No. . . never. . .
Promise, this is the first time.

738
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,530
Why are you man handling me?

739
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,977
What are you having?

740
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,478
Whafs this?

741
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,553
Have you stopped having plain water?

742
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,752
Oh my God!

743
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:36,435
Oh my God! What a boy!

744
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:43,775
He has ﬁlled my heart without
leaving a millimeter place...

745
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,942
Like a terrorist with dagger like eyes...

746
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,520
Like a sorcerer with
hypnotic eyes...

747
00:56:54,677 --> 00:57:02,892
He's troubling me. . .
catch him. . . catch him...

748
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,770
Sing whatever you can mouth...

749
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,278
Dance whatever your body can...

750
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,620
Drink whatever your hands lay <i>on...</i>

751
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,452
World is a swing,
swing to your heart...

752
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,093
Let's rock it!

753
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,033
Let's have the fun!

754
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,341
<i>Come</i> O <i>girl...</i>

755
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,854
<i>Let's</i> rock <i>it...</i>

756
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:08,052
Are Tatas and Birlas greater than us?

757
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,871
I'm like the ﬁlament in Edison's bulb...

758
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,139
Your mere touch can switch me <i>on...</i>

759
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:04,046
I'm silent ﬁre like microwave...

760
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:08,053
If you give me your heart,
I'll show you my talent...

761
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,789
Hey boy! Are you a clone of love code?

762
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:19,297
Hey girl, so much following
for just one look...

763
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:03,033
My name is Margareta,
Iwas born like a mocktail...

764
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,737
Steal my beauty with your eyes...

765
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:10,441
Youth is a garden of ﬂower
without a watchman...

766
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,612
If you invite,
I'll land like a dragon ﬂy...

767
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,121
Hey boy, should we invite you?

768
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:25,528
Hey girl, don't you want me
to enter the arena?

769
01:00:54,884 --> 01:01:01,392
My red dupatta is ﬂying in wind...

770
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:07,166
My red dupatta is waving in <i>air...</i>

771
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,001
What?

772
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,165
Why did you stop us?

773
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,070
I'm off duty now, right?

774
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,277
Start the car.
Have you gone mad?

775
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:17,984
Have you gone mad?

776
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:19,848
Who would be madder than you?

777
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:23,118
Do you feel you're a great beauty?

778
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,284
Here comes Queen Victoria!

779
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:31,659
While creating Lord Brahma took
lunch hreak and left you half done.

780
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,855
That's why you're so...

781
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,860
Premila madam, please come here.

782
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:43,766
Look how docile she is.

783
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:44,536
Look at her patience.

784
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,771
That cuteness.

785
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:47,643
Look at those big eyes!

786
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:53,211
Any man would love to fall
into it and take a swim.

787
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:59,152
Don't look down,
fans like me would get hurt.

788
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,060
“ﬂay are you feeling so shy?

789
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,390
He's scolding me.
- He's not beating, be happy for it.

790
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,896
Be IIQPPY‘

791
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:05,999
Moreover he's drunk.

792
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:07,095
Indeed.

793
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,132
Give the keys.

794
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,166
You're off the duty, right?
Give the keys.

795
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,035
I'll get you fired from job.

796
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:15,232
Oh mother!

797
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:20,071
Ifi lose my job, how would
I eat food and take bath?

798
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,806
I'm really scared, mother.

799
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,113
Ifhalfbuilt house like you
is so proud,

800
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,118
I'm tall like a seven story building,
how proud should I be?

801
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,620
What do you say, onlookers?

802
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:35,726
Hey Sashi, sute of the house!

803
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,228
She's crying!

804
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,729
Start the car, for my sake.

805
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:45,137
Not just car,
I can take her life for you.

806
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:48,842
Come.

807
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,606
What do you feel on seeing
the eldest girl?

808
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,646
I feel the dress is too short.

809
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:57,284
I feel she would become
our madam in short cut.

810
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,441
You mean they...

811
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,493
You...you only madam.

812
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,860
Do you remember
what you said last night?

813
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,635
It wasn't me, madam.

814
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,832
I'll tell my mother
about last night's incident.

815
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:23,807
Not only this, you'll lose job
and roam on streets.

816
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,502
Please madam, don't hit my livelihood.

817
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:28,171
I‘ve only one job,
I don't have money also.

818
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,645
Mother!

819
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,482
Don't hit the livelihood
of a worker, madam.

820
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,451
Don't hit his livelihood,
it's wrong, madam.

821
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:40,791
Mother, last night Siddu
created a big scene.

822
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:41,725
Call him.

823
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:46,159
Mummy is calling you.

824
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,427
Take out the car, need to go out.

825
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:52,369
Bye madam.

826
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,188
I though hotel owner means
very old woman.

827
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,559
She's very Young'

828
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:22,432
Those who took loan are young
but lender is getting old.

829
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,596
I'm not refusing to repay the loan.

830
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,137
How will you repay it?

831
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,939
I'm discussing a deal with
a software company,

832
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:35,075
if deal is okay,
for next 3 years We'll 40% occupancy.

833
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:36,216
<i>That“ not mateﬂaﬁse, madam.</i>

834
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,987
Simple, your hotel would
raided tomorrow,

835
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,812
we'll catch few call girls,

836
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,087
company would tear the
contract and walk out.

837
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,818
Don't unnecessarily go against ego.

838
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,259
Look at my face,
do I look like a egoistic man?

839
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:53,059
If I remove my beard,
I'll be like Arnul baby.

840
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:58,004
She need not repay me,
I'll pay 25 extra,

841
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,604
tell her to give the hotel to me.

842
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,406
Am I asking too much?

843
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,242
Never heard any better deal
than this in my life.

844
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:10,941
<i>H you're adamant “kc this,
my man is short (angered.</i>

845
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,280
Unnecessarily in angry mood
he may harm your husband.

846
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,477
Whywould I not get angry?

847
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,885
When I eat salt and spice!
I‘ll get angry.

848
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,923
I'll do something,
I'll cut something.

849
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,960
Cutting this or s0me0ne's neck
aren't much different.

850
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,223
That will move when I cut
and this will not.

851
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:25,331
Thafs the only difference.

852
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,371
Go to road number l2!

853
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,151
What y0u‘re doing wrong, sir?

854
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,817
Keep your hands on heart and think.

855
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,517
I'll never keep hands on heart
except while sleeping.

856
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:27,854
Who are you man?

857
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,788
Me? I'm a driver.

858
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,262
Why are you discussing with a driver?
Throw him out.

859
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,821
When an ACP is here,
how dare you beat my men!

860
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,191
I'll kill you!
Are you a goon?

861
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,864
You mad man!
Have I entered any exhibition?

862
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,399
To see around.

863
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:10,729
One who fears will shout
and brave will bear it.

864
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,531
No need to tell which category
you belong to.

865
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,539
Are you a great man
if you beat four men?

866
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,473
I'm old city Parameshwar!

867
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:20,978
Every Sunday I play card game
with Home Minister.

868
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,307
State or central?

869
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:24,113
Call him.

870
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:26,543
He told you his name, right? Call him.

871
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,759
What? What’s that built up?

872
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,222
Who that man is in halfsuit?

873
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,089
Who are you calling now?

874
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,389
Will you settle things on phone?

875
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,088
Should we accept your
phone settlement?

876
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,757
I've gray my hair,
I'm using dye.

877
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:42,233
You'll get the call.

878
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:51,910
Who is it, brother?

879
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,513
What happened, brother?

880
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:58,081
Down your gun!

881
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,583
I don't have any connection
with him, sir.

882
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:06,458
They invited me for marriage and
offered chicken, so I came.

883
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,151
Chicken isn't tasty too.

884
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:09,422
What happened, brother?

885
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,189
Asking me, what had happened?

886
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,264
I'm ﬁnished.

887
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:13,992
Before calling me for any settlement,

888
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:17,069
know the back ground of
people you're facing!

889
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,770
Call from central Home Minister.

890
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,602
Gave me a lesson on phone.
He wants me in Delhi by tomorrow.

891
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:26,035
Are you watching any ﬁlm?

892
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:29,042
You'll die man!
He's dinosaur, run away!

893
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,978
Sir, am I still in the post
or dismissed?

894
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:37,215
You come here, sir.
I'll find and tell you.

895
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,456
If you give loan, should they’ve
to sell their hotel to you?

896
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:47,756
If not will you kill them?

897
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,335
If they sell, buy it,
that's business.

898
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,642
Don't try to usurp it.
It's grabbing!

899
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,576
I'm here to protect her.

900
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,644
Who is there to save you from me?

901
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,153
Sir, he may die in fear.

902
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,484
My anger isn't easing,
what am I to do?

903
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,125
Come here.

904
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:16,460
Hey you!

905
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,565
Where's my hand and
where your cheek is?

906
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:33,909
I'll not beat you this time.

907
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:40,014
If the torn agreement doesn't
reach her hands in 30 minutes.

908
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,123
Lord Jesus! Please don't finish
that sentence.

909
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,350
I'll not give you that opportunity.

910
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:46,615
Trust me.

911
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:48,694
Do YOIFVe paper and pen?

912
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,096
To respectable sister Sunanda,

913
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:00,573
madam, you're like a sister to me!

914
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,174
Madam, you're like a sister to me.

915
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,368
It was my mistake to behave
like that with you.

916
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:09,647
Here's the agreement you singed.
I'm giving it back to you.

917
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:16,714
If you need any help in future,
I'll do it as your brother.

918
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:20,583
Forwhatever had happened...
- I'm ashamed of.

919
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,426
What do you say for forgive
in Telugu?

920
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:24,030
Please forgive me, madam.

921
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:25,860
What happened;

922
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,592
An hour ago, Satan took over me, madam.

923
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:29,998
I wanted your hotel.

924
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,435
Now Jesus is in my heart!

925
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:33,699
I'm returning it to you.

926
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,205
Why did you change dramatically?

927
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,469
When I got her to sign by force,
nobody asked me why?

928
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,740
Now I'm reformed and returning it,
why are you asking so many questions?

929
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,681
Yes, no need of details
when rogues reform.

930
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:48,182
<i>Not that...</i>
- <i>Madam!</i>

931
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,583
There's a great power behind you, madam.

932
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:58,660
Till that is with you,
nobody can dare touch you, madam.

933
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,058
Lord Jesus!

934
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,689
“ﬂay was he looking
at you only, Siddu?

935
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:30,353
Nothing like that.

936
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:31,528
He did!

937
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,363
Keep quiet, don't say like that.

938
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,709
I'm sacred, Premila.

939
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:49,044
There's something magical in you!

940
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,046
Anyone would fall for it.

941
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:08,234
She rolled her eyes like top...
She rolled her curls...

942
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:12,531
She made me roll over her sexy waist...

943
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:20,773
<i>Oh</i> God! She's <i>Bapu's girl...
Oh my God,</i> she's a <i>jasmine twig...</i>

944
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,181
She took the colour from rubber bangles...

945
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,478
She applied red colour
on her cheeks...

946
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:29,680
She ﬂew me like a kite
with her ribbon...

947
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,883
Oh God, is her sight gum?

948
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,262
Oh God, she's an enchantress...

949
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:42,163
She felled me with her rosy <i>lips...</i>

950
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:46,773
She won over me waging a war
without swords...

951
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:50,706
She danced on my heart...

952
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:55,542
Watching her dance steps,
I lost my sleep...

953
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:26,412
Humming a song while drying
clothes on the terrace...

954
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:31,142
She sang a song to
squeeze my heart out...

955
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:39,258
While serving me with
a glass ofcoifee...

956
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,326
Touching me with her gentle body...

957
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:44,260
She electriﬁed me with inciting desires
with the live wire ofpassion...

958
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:52,395
She seasoned <i>me</i> like they do
while cooking vegetables...

959
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:56,701
Wherever she looks,
it appears like she's seeing <i>me...</i>

960
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,938
She stitched into my heart the thread
used for making ﬂower garland...

961
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:05,074
She imprisoned me with sari <i>end...</i>

962
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,117
She says hello early morning...

963
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,278
She invades my dreams as night falls...

964
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:14,053
All her memories haunt
as far as she goes <i>away...</i>

965
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:04,906
She gently pushed into some
magical world. <i>. .</i>

966
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:09,038
She locked the door
and lost the keys...

967
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,651
She carried my heart
to the clouds...

968
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:21,852
Without making noise,
she took away the ladder...

969
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,993
She took my heart in her hand
and closed the <i>ﬁst...</i>

970
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:35,266
The wind of her beauty raised me
back into life again...

971
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:39,675
She imprinted many a sweet
nothings with her thoughts...

972
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,612
She put goggles of love to my eyes...

973
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:47,879
Princess ofKosala, a beautiful girl
who raked up desires in <i>me...</i>

974
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:52,389
She made me a garland of beads
and wore it around her <i>neck...</i>

975
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:34,492
Don't tell my mother
about eating ice cream.

976
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,998
She fears I may put on weight.

977
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,708
I don't like smoking.

978
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,977
Come closer, I'll tell you a story.

979
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:47,344
Two thieves from Stuartpuram
went to steal a home,

980
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:48,503
both of them faced each other,

981
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:51,446
if anyone of them shouts,
inmates would wake up,

982
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,677
they'll thrash them,

983
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:55,052
so both of them cleverly
did one thing,

984
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,951
both shared equally the booty,

985
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,887
and went away as they came.

986
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,950
Whafs the moral of the story dear?

987
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,161
When you have an ice cream,
I'll close my eyes,

988
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,356
when I smoke cigarette,
close your nose.

989
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:12,064
Mind your business.

990
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,008
If you want, take it.

991
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:25,310
Do you know them, Prernila?

992
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,156
Why are you beating up
while talking to her?

993
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:32,555
What were you talking to her?

994
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:36,560
Her ear rings were nice,
inquiring about where she bought it..

995
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:37,853
Mummy bought it.

996
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:40,990
Who are you calling?
- Her mummy.

997
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:42,568
To know where she bought it.
- No need.

998
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,463
<i>No Q</i>

999
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,839
When you don't need it,
why were you asking silly things?

1000
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,935
There's a rule to tell lies too.

1001
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:52,041
At least one of the gang appears
like buying an earring.

1002
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,838
Everyone appears like a thieﬂ

1003
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,242
He may get hurt, Siddu!

1004
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:01,013
Mad Premila!
What are you saying?

1005
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:04,180
I hit to hurt them, right?
Strongly!

1006
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,392
That's why people have names.

1007
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:20,470
Instead ofrings and bangles,
buy something useful to men.

1008
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:21,869
Am I right, Premila?

1009
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,158
Look after him!

1010
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:53,965
Rajesh, get the bike.

1011
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,592
What are you looking around?
Sister must be with me in 5 minutes.

1012
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,521
Still got 2 more minutes
in the time you gave me,

1013
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,923
Get your sister, go.

1014
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:58,693
He's near her.

1015
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,058
He doesn't have courage
to kill anyone,

1016
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,067
he doesn't have commitment
to die too.

1017
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:05,227
Get her!

1018
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:07,269
Go.

1019
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,880
Who are they?
- I don't know, father.

1020
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:18,716
Can you recognise them?
- No.

1021
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,319
“ﬂay didn't you go to police?

1022
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:21,920
We mustn't leave such incidents simply.

1023
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:25,547
It's time for wedding invitations
not court summons.

1024
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,419
Well said.

1025
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,821
We mustn't go public over such issues.

1026
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,395
We must cover such incidents
under the carpet.

1027
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,192
Don't arrange felicitations
for Siddu on saving her.

1028
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:34,800
By the way, what happened to Siddu?

1029
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:37,470
He beat them, how can he get hurt?

1030
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,502
He may have heat them,
he brought you home safely.

1031
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,577
Call Dr.Navin here.
- Okay, brother.

1032
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:24,810
When he was angry,
my father used to do just like this.

1033
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:30,213
My brother used to tease me
that I too have the same habit.

1034
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:38,754
When I left home,
he had a son of this height.

1035
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:42,795
He was very intelligent.

1036
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:49,241
When I say ﬁll the tank,
any driver would ask for money,

1037
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,409
he won't leave with the keys,

1038
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:54,346
he doesn't know that,

1039
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:59,352
I and your father grew up
together for 22 years,

1040
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,354
I can see him in you,

1041
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:06,688
when you speak,
I can hear your grandfather,

1042
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:09,627
can't I recognise you?

1043
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:16,259
He can throw out his daughter
from home every easily,

1044
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:20,165
but I can't even dismiss
a car driver.

1045
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,673
That's why you're still here.

1046
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,270
Has your grandpa lost
his grip due to old age?

1047
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:31,781
Did he ask you to bring me?

1048
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:36,956
He diddt send me happily
after I got married,

1049
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:40,855
he sent me away with
my bloodied husband.

1050
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:53,005
Is that all you can do, father?

1051
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:04,878
When police said about
threat from my enemies,

1052
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,383
Father, let's sit and talk it out.
Father, please!

1053
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,713
I bought this gun.

1054
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:10,384
<i>But my enemy w as bum in my home.</i>

1055
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,458
I raised her myself.
- What are you doing, father?

1056
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:15,223
I'll cut it myself.

1057
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:20,633
This is what I can do!

1058
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:40,017
We didn't come here expecting
you'd welcome us, father.

1059
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,919
I thought you'd understand us.

1060
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,249
I know you'd shout at us.

1061
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:49,660
I thought ofpacifying you.

1062
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,321
I expected your anger, father.

1063
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:58,664
But I couldn't expect your hatred.

1064
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:06,973
You killed me there.
You died here.

1065
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:13,884
The place where my husbancfs blood
fell is cemetery to me.

1066
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:17,883
Come.

1067
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:23,955
Please Nandu, listen to me.

1068
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:31,032
Don't worry brother,
I'll not file a case on father.

1069
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:32,567
Come.

1070
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,042
I'm not angry on you.

1071
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:42,680
Because I've to remember
you for that.

1072
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:44,643
I don't like it.

1073
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,419
I don't lose anything
if you stay here.

1074
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,587
It isn't ofany use to you.

1075
01:25:54,449 --> 01:26:00,491
<i>But one thing, Shaka: got about
Muck as soon as you came.</i>

1076
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:01,996
You saved him.

1077
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:06,334
Hotel is in problems,
you solved it.

1078
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:11,106
Today Premila got kidnapped,
you saved her.

1079
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,612
If these incidents had
happened naturally, it's okay.

1080
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:23,255
If it was planned
and solved by you,

1081
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:27,683
impressing us and were planning
to take us to your grandpa,

1082
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,656
I too have a gun and
license for it.

1083
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:37,292
But I won't miss the target
like your grandpa.

1084
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:11,694
I saw everything sir.
You both had a good talk.

1085
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:12,770
<i>who?</i>

1086
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:14,338
You both!

1087
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:18,640
Who were talking?
- She talked, sir.

1088
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,505
Why did you say both then?

1089
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:24,047
I thought you'd convince your aunt
and take her to your grandpa.

1090
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:25,240
Grandfather?

1091
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,118
She was talking,
how could she get convinced by it?

1092
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:30,688
But she knew I was Gautham.

1093
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:33,993
We got caught playing hide and seek
in a ﬂoodlit stadium.

1094
01:27:34,148 --> 01:27:34,853
Like fools!

1095
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:39,726
Did your aunt chide you
in front of entire family, right?

1096
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:42,333
If we were just two,
why would entire family be there?

1097
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:44,163
Bloody idiot!

1098
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:48,438
You're not fit to talk anyway,
you're unfit to get angrywith too.

1099
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:52,806
Sir, if you promise not to beat,
I'll say something.

1100
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:54,002
Cry it oﬁY

1101
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:57,578
Nobody else knows that you're her
nephew other than your aunt, right?

1102
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:59,116
No, she won't tell anyone.

1103
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:01,481
Take advantage of it and use it.

1104
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:04,123
Don't beating around the bush,
come to the point directly.

1105
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,158
Tell you love her with aunt's
elder daughter Prernila.

1106
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:09,192
Would she follow me if I say so?

1107
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:13,196
She's crazy about you, sir.

1108
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:16,029
She'll die for you, sir.

1109
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:23,636
On hearing your name,
she'd say beau...beau...

1110
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,037
Balu, ﬁnish it quickly.

1111
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,044
I'm dying with tension
to hear rest of it.

1112
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:29,908
Tell me what's next?

1113
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,574
She loves you very much, sir.

1114
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:35,812
She'll eat you alive with
her eyes, sir.

1115
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:39,117
Just g0 to her and
say I love you.

1116
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,818
She'll immediately follow you
like a Pomeranian dog.

1117
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:46,898
Your aunt will also follow you
in the next ﬂight.

1118
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:50,201
Balu, you did make
a valuable suggestion.

1119
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:51,495
I want to kiss you.

1120
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,340
I lost my confidence hearing
my aunt's chiding remarks.

1121
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:05,611
Balu, I need little encouragement.

1122
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:15,786
What do you want son?

1123
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,931
IfPremila sees me?
- She'll get tempted.

1124
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:21,328
If I talk to her?
- She'll melt.

1125
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:24,002
If I touch her?
- She'll get connected.

1126
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,171
If you stay here, you'll get late.

1127
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,646
Hey' “m . at are y _ Stop!
o“ dmng?

1128
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,717
Why did you stop me?
- Why do you want to kill yourself?

1129
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:45,880
Why should I live?

1130
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:48,755
Will you stop asking questions
and answer me?

1131
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:51,227
Why should I live when I don't
get what I like?

1132
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,663
I think she knows I'm going away.

1133
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,666
Whywill you not get it?
What you like is right before you!

1134
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:00,237
It's yours any day.

1135
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:01,738
Not mine.

1136
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,338
She's feeling because I'm a driver.

1137
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:08,345
Prerni, I'm not a driver as you think.
- Yes, you're a rogue.

1138
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:10,949
You separated me from my lover.

1139
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:18,989
Lover?

1140
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:23,086
Who is he?
- Rohit, the man you beat in mall.

1141
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:24,888
He kidnapped you, right?

1142
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:27,123
I-Iad he kidnapped me,
I would've shouted, right?

1143
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:33,530
We love each other for 3 years now.

1144
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:37,933
We had decided to run away
today and marry.

1145
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,440
You spoiled everything.
Are you happy now?

1146
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,183
He's getting married tomorrow night.

1147
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,384
He's getting married night, right?

1148
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:48,981
I‘ll bring him by morning.

1149
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:50,884
He has been taken away
by the marriage party.

1150
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,454
Where?

1151
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:04,369
Siddappa Naidu is village head
of that place.

1152
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:06,969
One daughter and two sons.

1153
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:09,439
Second son is very violent.

1154
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:15,679
He cut the hand for stealing
his daughter's hag.

1155
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:19,210
Can you bring my future
husband from such a house?

1156
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:22,415
I'll bring.
- Will you leave tonight?

1157
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:28,484
I need little time to recover
from such shocks.

1158
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:29,625
I need time.

1159
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,987
Meanwhile, you take a bath in the tub.

1160
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,929
Use drier to dry your hair.

1161
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:37,899
But don't join both, please!

1162
01:31:39,026 --> 01:31:41,131
It's my responsibility
to unite you both.

1163
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:42,171
My responsibility!

1164
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:55,813
I can see the marriage canopy...

1165
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:58,890
The auspicious time to unite...

1166
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:02,653
What a situational song!

1167
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:09,626
Open the suitcases.

1168
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:11,962
Continue the stay in hotel.

1169
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:14,167
Keep plane in parking bay.

1170
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:16,938
Take me to a hospital.

1171
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:20,712
I want to go to Chittoor,
get me a vehicle.

1172
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:22,142
One of you come with me.

1173
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:22,906
For courage, sir?

1174
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,050
To get scolded and
beaten up when I'm angry.

1175
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:28,779
Someone wants to go to Chittoor,
a group fell on my feet.

1176
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:33,790
You know, I'm very sentimental,
he'll drive, I'll show directions.

1177
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:36,428
This is Rohit's photo.
I'll give their address.

1178
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:37,856
He's not that great.

1179
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,524
Bad ph0t0gf3PhY'

1180
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:41,724
Your choice too is bad.

1181
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:43,725
Please bring him carefully.

1182
01:32:45,259 --> 01:32:47,364
She's not saying at least go carefully.

1183
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:49,073
Nothing.

1184
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:57,340
Okay.--0k3Y!

1185
01:32:57,872 --> 01:32:59,647
I'm sure they've stolen something.

1186
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:22,932
I don't have any complaint
in life without <i>you...</i>

1187
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,937
Girls have no taste.

1188
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:32,078
He's like a I V tower wearing shirt.
She loves him.

1189
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:36,346
She's much better, the younger one
will surely select a terrorist.

1190
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,790
What are your sweet memories with her?

1191
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:41,552
Nothing sir, recently she said
I lost my purse,

1192
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:42,751
and asked did you take it?

1193
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:43,691
“ﬂay didn't you hit back with slippers?

1194
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:48,357
When I asked why? She said purse
rhymes with nurse, s0 I asked you.

1195
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:51,264
If she loses a tractor
would she ask a doctor?

1196
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:53,427
No need to think of her, sir.

1197
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:56,370
Seeing her is had omen and
crossing her path is death.

1198
01:33:58,933 --> 01:34:00,037
Looks just like her.

1199
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:20,457
Do you've to travel so long
to reach from there to here?

1200
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:21,429
Respect?

1201
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:23,296
You didn't get hurt, did you?

1202
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:38,515
order two dosas, please.
- Two dosas, brother.

1203
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:43,685
I think she would've fallen
into jeep from balcony.

1204
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:45,187
She has lost her mind.

1205
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:47,424
It's amnesia.

1206
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:49,825
When will she remember her past?

1207
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:51,990
How would I know?

1208
01:34:52,486 --> 01:34:53,521
ism
t it?

1209
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:55,126
What happened to me?

1210
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,496
Nothing, your parents didn't
agree for our marriage.

1211
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:01,203
Add onions in pesarattu.
- Why?

1212
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:02,873
You're mu aunt's daughter.

1213
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:04,868
our families are at loggerheads.

1214
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,709
That's why we've eloped.

1215
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:09,846
Don't use oil, use ghee.

1216
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:11,711
Don't I've sisters?

1217
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:17,384
You've a sister, she loves someone.

1218
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,555
A sand laden lorry hit him.

1219
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:22,560
It's not wrong to add
cashew nuts too for them.

1220
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:25,224
Who is he?
- Doctor!

1221
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:28,998
He prescribed medicines for you, right?
Isn't it, doctor?

1222
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:31,526
Where's his stethoscope?

1223
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:33,699
I sold it to buy diesel.

1224
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:35,431
Don't bill them.

1225
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:36,574
Beau!

1226
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:43,242
You're my beau, right?

1227
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:47,943
Right,

1228
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:52,683
When she addresses me like that
I'm overcome with feelings.

1229
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,426
Beau! You're rich, right?

1230
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:58,724
Problem must be in your home,
why are we facing it in my house?

1231
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:01,833
She has forgotten the past
but not logic.

1232
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:06,267
A fear the rick kids have bad habits.

1233
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:10,671
But you don't look like that, beau.

1234
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:17,941
Actually your grandpa is the only
one to agree for our marriage.

1235
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:21,719
Is he any less? He has
left billions for you.

1236
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:23,547
No need to talk about that now, Padhu.

1237
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:25,281
Just for information, right?

1238
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:38,366
Beau!

1239
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:40,504
Would you like to speak
to your grandpa on phone?

1240
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:45,134
You sit as it is.

1241
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:47,411
Grandpa!

1242
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:48,137
Talk to him.

1243
01:36:53,374 --> 01:36:54,352
Give the phone to grandpa.

1244
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,092
HOW are you, sunny.

1245
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:01,749
Would you like to speak
to your granddaughter?

1246
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:04,453
Would she speak to me?

1247
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:05,929
Talk to him.

1248
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:09,399
Grandpa, I'm Sashi here.

1249
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:11,867
How are you, dear?

1250
01:37:12,026 --> 01:37:16,099
I'm fine, grandpa
but my parents didn't approve it.

1251
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,368
How can they accept s0 easily?

1252
01:37:20,467 --> 01:37:22,447
What has happened wasn't
a small issue, right?

1253
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:25,676
Whether it is big or small,
it‘s over, right?

1254
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,945
Why should we hang on
to it for years?

1255
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:30,588
Though you're young,
what you said is right.

1256
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:32,587
Is it wrong to marry uncle's son?

1257
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,122
Marriage;

1258
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:37,319
Nothing, grandpa.
- Playing fun with aunt's daughter?

1259
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:38,485
Something like that.

1260
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:40,257
Shall I call you later?

1261
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:48,599
I felt like crying on
hearing grandpefs voice.

1262
01:37:52,132 --> 01:37:54,476
Everything will be ﬁne.
- Thank you, beau.

1263
01:37:58,305 --> 01:37:59,716
Get up, please.

1264
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:00,950
He's here.

1265
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:03,784
Whafs this?

1266
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:06,857
Your love story may be old,
but this sari is new,

1267
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:10,120
before they ﬁnish eating that
please wear this sari.

1268
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:13,124
Take it.

1269
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:16,360
Go!

1270
01:38:25,099 --> 01:38:29,605
My pulse rate raced on seeing <i>you...</i>

1271
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:32,649
Why is it so?

1272
01:38:34,408 --> 01:38:39,289
Without seeing you my eyes went
hammer and tongs on each other...

1273
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:42,289
Why did it do like that?

1274
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:54,901
Go away!

1275
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:26,803
Don't know what it is...what magic
you spread with just a look...

1276
01:39:26,994 --> 01:39:33,104
Don't know what it is...y0u gave me
a disease with your body shake...

1277
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:39,240
Like a drowning ﬂood, burning ﬁre,
you took my life, dear...

1278
01:40:31,759 --> 01:40:37,004
<i>Such a vast sky...endless blue...</i>

1279
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:41,412
How could you ﬁll all that
in your little ﬁsh eyes?

1280
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:43,548
You rocked me!

1281
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:49,279
It's true that gold is hidden
inside earth...

1282
01:40:49,443 --> 01:40:55,883
But growing on earth and moving,
you've re-written the history...

1283
01:40:56,216 --> 01:41:02,189
When you break into a jig in sari...
Shall I follow you like an ant?

1284
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:08,602
When you move swinging like a boat...
May I follow you like wind?

1285
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:14,577
Let's be together like Radha-Krishna
and pain-sadness...

1286
01:41:30,951 --> 01:41:34,398
D aughter-in-law without
mother-in-law is great <i>lady...</i>

1287
01:41:34,555 --> 01:41:37,729
Mother-in-law without
daughter-in-law is great <i>lady...</i>

1288
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:46,969
D aughter- in-law. . . son's wife!
You're a cream of fresh milk...

1289
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:51,411
Moonlight of the night...

1290
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:24,481
Who s0 ever may have painted
the picture ofMona <i>Lisa...</i>

1291
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:28,712
I'm sure he hasn't seen the
milky beauty of you...

1292
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:30,822
Whafs the use?

1293
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:37,125
One who took away the Kohinoor
diamond may be a <i>King...</i>

1294
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:43,497
Poor man doesn't know the shine
of that diamond is in you...

1295
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:46,998
Ify0u‘re born and
brought up like this...

1296
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:49,470
I-Iow much can I sing
in praise of you?

1297
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:55,774
I've used all the words I know
in Telugu to write this song...

1298
01:42:55,936 --> 01:43:01,909
Like Sirivennelafs songs and
Veturi's lyrics, you're so sweet, my dear...

1299
01:43:49,489 --> 01:43:53,562
Why have we come here, dear?
- To take a small parcel.

1300
01:43:54,494 --> 01:43:55,495
Shall I wait here?

1301
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:57,665
Will you wait?

1302
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:00,071
My sweet darling, come.

1303
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:04,575
What will you do waiting here?
You promised to marry me.

1304
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:05,580
Will you marry me?
- I do.

1305
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:08,379
I think you'd go on honeymoon before
that marriage happens, come.

1306
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:09,520
You go, I'll follow.

1307
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:11,249
Come.
- Shall I go?

1308
01:44:11,545 --> 01:44:13,183
Will you wait?
- Come, let's go.

1309
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:14,585
<i>Comemcome...</i>

1310
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:15,726
Dear!

1311
01:44:15,882 --> 01:44:17,884
He'll come back, not going away.

1312
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:20,088
He'll come back in few minutes.

1313
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:24,799
Comemwhy are you pulling it up?

1314
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:27,768
Getting ready to fight
Wait, I'll settle this issue.

1315
01:44:27,894 --> 01:44:28,634
How;

1316
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:32,140
Asking me how? You said y0u‘re
a billionaire, did I believe it?

1317
01:44:32,332 --> 01:44:33,811
Let me use the same formula here.

1318
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,777
If they ask, let's tell them we're
here to take away the groom.

1319
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:39,679
They'll offer sweets and
send us in.- Come.

1320
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:40,815
Do something.

1321
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:44,122
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1322
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:44,881
Give it.

1323
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:46,454
Take sweets.

1324
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:50,186
You are...?
- I'm bride's second brother.

1325
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:51,351
He's elder brother.

1326
01:44:53,086 --> 01:44:56,260
You are...?
- We're here to kidnap the groom.

1327
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,835
Didn't I tell they'll not
believe the truth?

1328
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:03,337
The groom up there doesn't
like your sister,

1329
01:45:03,497 --> 01:45:04,840
he loves another girl,

1330
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:06,909
he sought our help
and we're here.

1331
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:09,274
Padhu, they didn't ask all that details.

1332
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:11,541
Truth isn't a DVD movie!

1333
01:45:11,705 --> 01:45:13,651
To press pause button
as and when you feel!

1334
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:14,649
It's a ﬁlm in theatre!

1335
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:18,085
Once the titles start, curtains
mustn't come down till it is over.

1336
01:45:18,245 --> 01:45:20,156
Where's the groom?
- Upstairs.

1337
01:45:20,547 --> 01:45:21,287
This way, sir.

1338
01:45:21,448 --> 01:45:25,555
Didn't I say sweets? They don't
believe if I tell truth also, fools.

1339
01:45:27,287 --> 01:45:29,494
Truth is like ﬁre.

1340
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:33,761
One who says my feel the burn but
one who hears will feel it's warrnth.

1341
01:45:35,595 --> 01:45:37,131
Keep those things there!

1342
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:42,608
They say there's more in
a marriage that will stop!

1343
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:46,409
In fact I feel pity for these guys!

1344
01:45:55,949 --> 01:45:57,053
Don't know what it is!

1345
01:46:04,691 --> 01:46:06,170
Why are you dull?

1346
01:46:06,326 --> 01:46:09,034
I should be marrying her
but I'm marrying her.

1347
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:10,703
How would I be other than dull?

1348
01:46:11,264 --> 01:46:13,710
Stop crying like a girl
and come with us.

1349
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:15,369
If they know, they'll kill us.

1350
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,105
They gave your address.

1351
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:20,645
Look at this long hair man,
he's very good man.

1352
01:46:20,874 --> 01:46:21,978
He offered sweets too.

1353
01:46:22,142 --> 01:46:24,053
Who among you is the leader?

1354
01:46:24,611 --> 01:46:26,318
Padhu sir leads in everything!

1355
01:46:26,847 --> 01:46:27,757
<i>For what?</i>

1356
01:46:28,448 --> 01:46:29,893
Why are you looking at me furiously?

1357
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:31,193
Will you beat me?

1358
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,562
He appears like a good man!

1359
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:05,886
Elderly man!

1360
01:47:07,454 --> 01:47:08,125
Oh my God!

1361
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:17,332
One second delay I w0uld’ve lost
my head instead of hair.

1362
01:47:17,531 --> 01:47:20,068
Did you get it now?
Truth burns both teller and listener.

1363
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:24,944
Oh my God! They're following us!

1364
01:48:01,174 --> 01:48:04,121
Oh no! They're closing in!

1365
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:10,760
They' re closing in!

1366
01:48:24,064 --> 01:48:25,304
Follow the vehicle!

1367
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:39,046
Go fast!

1368
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:57,034
No road, don't go!

1369
01:48:57,864 --> 01:48:59,343
I should be in home,
how did I come here?

1370
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:02,707
She got back her past!

1371
01:49:08,241 --> 01:49:10,881
They're closing in, go fast!

1372
01:49:15,248 --> 01:49:16,420
Where am I?

1373
01:49:16,783 --> 01:49:18,262
Don't leave them!

1374
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:24,131
They're coming!
- Didn't he kidnap my sister?

1375
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:30,067
Who changed my dress?

1376
01:49:30,297 --> 01:49:32,903
I'm coming to kill you.

1377
01:49:33,366 --> 01:49:36,404
Whafs this?
Tell me who changed this?

1378
01:49:41,107 --> 01:49:46,056
Comemcome with me.
- You did something...

1379
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:48,852
So many people are coming!
“ﬂay are they fighting?

1380
01:49:51,151 --> 01:49:52,061
Who are you?

1381
01:50:32,525 --> 01:50:34,027
Who is father of the
running away man?

1382
01:50:35,095 --> 01:50:36,472
Who is the father of fallen man?

1383
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:45,145
Beating up my son, how dare you
come to me making inquiries!

1384
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:48,980
Look, King is an old man
like you in chess board,

1385
01:50:49,142 --> 01:50:52,851
Just one step this side or that side.

1386
01:50:53,013 --> 01:50:55,493
But why do people call him as king?

1387
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:59,392
Because Minister is next t0 him.
That‘s his strength!

1388
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:03,096
Who is your strength?

1389
01:51:03,256 --> 01:51:04,633
Who gives you the power
to twirl your moustache?

1390
01:51:04,824 --> 01:51:06,303
Whose muscles make you boast?

1391
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:08,302
Whose courage makes you
take out a dagger?

1392
01:51:08,828 --> 01:51:09,568
Who is he?

1393
01:51:09,896 --> 01:51:13,742
He can bring down an elephant
with one punch!

1394
01:51:14,768 --> 01:51:15,610
He's my man!

1395
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:16,779
MY bull!

1396
01:51:20,974 --> 01:51:22,214
This is my pride!

1397
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:26,824
If you touch it,
it's like beating me,

1398
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,618
if you wear it,
it's like I'm dead.

1399
01:51:31,217 --> 01:51:32,491
Good timing!

1400
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:33,492
If you touch it,
it's like beating me,

1401
01:51:33,653 --> 01:51:35,098
if you wear it,
it's like I'm dead.

1402
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:37,357
Why not add a good rhythm to it?
It could become a good song.

1403
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:43,236
Hack him in the name of
Ahobhilam Lord Narasimhaswamy!

1404
01:52:01,281 --> 01:52:04,057
Never step on snake
because it's resting.

1405
01:52:04,684 --> 01:52:08,655
Are you a great man
if you beat one man?

1406
01:52:08,988 --> 01:52:14,301
Each one of my men play swing
with live wires.

1407
01:52:14,461 --> 01:52:16,463
But never play with power plant!

1408
01:52:16,596 --> 01:52:17,472
You'll get blown up!

1409
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:01,205
One must catch their own thing!

1410
01:54:02,068 --> 01:54:05,106
Never try to catch another one's,
this will he the result.

1411
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:07,273
What? Be careful!

1412
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:12,046
How can he take him?
He must marry my daughter.

1413
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:15,022
Agreed it's your daughter's marriage
but death to another daughter.

1414
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:16,823
Which is more diﬂicult?

1415
01:54:18,084 --> 01:54:19,563
There's clarity in my question.

1416
01:54:19,919 --> 01:54:21,262
Would there be surety
in your answer?

1417
01:54:22,755 --> 01:54:24,029
Listen to me, Siddappa!

1418
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:27,034
If useful, use here only.

1419
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:28,672
Use wherever you can
if you remember.

1420
01:54:29,762 --> 01:54:31,207
I'm like lion.

1421
01:54:31,497 --> 01:54:35,035
It can't shave and I can.
That's the only difierence.

1422
01:54:35,468 --> 01:54:38,244
All other characters are same!

1423
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:44,151
Kick of having the last laugh
is terrible!

1424
01:54:45,578 --> 01:54:46,386
Get in!

1425
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,219
Get in quickly, he may beat me.

1426
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:59,935
before taking such a big decision,
you've guts to discuss with driver,

1427
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:01,697
but don't you've the sense
of telling your parents?

1428
01:55:01,861 --> 01:55:03,397
N0 sir...
- What no?

1429
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:05,008
Who is he? What does he do?

1430
01:55:05,164 --> 01:55:06,700
How would he look after you
after marriage?

1431
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,846
Don't you want to know anything?

1432
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:11,279
If you love, we'll kill,

1433
01:55:12,071 --> 01:55:13,846
if you marry, we'll burn you,

1434
01:55:14,807 --> 01:55:16,650
we're not that foolish
to say like this.

1435
01:55:19,612 --> 01:55:22,092
But we love you.

1436
01:55:23,182 --> 01:55:24,855
We respect your love.

1437
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:32,736
You've so much respect for
your daughter's love,

1438
01:55:32,892 --> 01:55:36,601
that man has got no respect
for my daughter's marriage.

1439
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:42,341
I wanted her marriage feast to spread the
delicious smell to 10 villages around.

1440
01:55:42,502 --> 01:55:44,539
But this trouble has reached
1 00 villages.

1441
01:55:44,704 --> 01:55:46,274
How embarrassing!

1442
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:48,646
His father took the dowry,
he dishonoured me.

1443
01:55:48,808 --> 01:55:52,051
My life has become
good for nothing.

1444
01:55:52,211 --> 01:55:55,385
It seems you're a famous lawyer,
please do justice to us.

1445
01:55:55,548 --> 01:55:56,618
Tell me!

1446
01:55:58,318 --> 01:55:59,126
Have it, sir.

1447
01:56:08,561 --> 01:56:11,235
The lady who served you
buttermilk is my sister.

1448
01:56:12,065 --> 01:56:16,571
My brother-in-law left her for festival
promising come back for her in 1 0 days,

1449
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:18,640
30 festivals have passed since then,

1450
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:20,581
he didn't turn up, sir.

1451
01:56:23,343 --> 01:56:25,414
If food is left
servants will eat it,

1452
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:30,257
if a girl remains in home,
you can never eat a meal peacefully.

1453
01:56:32,552 --> 01:56:36,261
You'll stand to lose if you
force your daughter as his wife.

1454
01:56:36,723 --> 01:56:38,464
Your <i>name...</i>
- <i>Siddappa!</i>

1455
01:56:40,727 --> 01:56:44,174
Tell me what did you spend
for the marriage?

1456
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:47,909
I'll take it as my daughter's marriage
and bear the entire cost.

1457
01:56:48,935 --> 01:56:51,506
What? Will you pay me?

1458
01:56:52,605 --> 01:56:55,415
Are you such a great man
to put a price on Siddappa?

1459
01:56:59,112 --> 01:57:00,989
Who said that? Show me!

1460
01:57:01,147 --> 01:57:02,683
How dare you raise weapon at him!
Bring it down.

1461
01:57:03,116 --> 01:57:03,856
Tell me!

1462
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:07,997
This is for cutting crops.
Not to cut throats!

1463
01:57:08,621 --> 01:57:09,929
<i>“wish to heat, h“ this man.</i>

1464
01:57:10,723 --> 01:57:13,431
he agreed to the marriage
without asking his son.

1465
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:19,541
Why are they after comedian in
the ﬁght between hero and villain?

1466
01:57:21,401 --> 01:57:23,779
They're good people, that's why
they're still talking to us, father.

1467
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:26,546
I-Iad they been like us,
they would've got us thrown out!

1468
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:28,951
Sorry sir.

1469
01:57:29,709 --> 01:57:31,052
In sorrow father...

1470
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:47,635
I'm asking forgiveness on his behalf.

1471
01:57:49,195 --> 01:57:52,039
It was his mistake
to offer your money.

1472
01:57:53,733 --> 01:57:55,508
For the loss of your honour,

1473
01:57:56,069 --> 01:57:57,412
honour ofmy home,

1474
01:57:58,971 --> 01:58:02,009
we'll give our second daughter
in marriage to your younger son.

1475
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:05,754
Take her with you, brother.

1476
01:58:21,294 --> 01:58:24,832
Give her, I'll think
I've another daughter.

1477
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:27,100
I'll look after her well.

1478
01:58:27,266 --> 01:58:35,208
My wife too isn't here to offer you
traditionally turtneric and vertnillion.

1479
01:58:35,608 --> 01:58:36,609
No problem.

1480
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:37,713
Give her.

1481
01:58:41,881 --> 01:58:43,758
I don't think you're not
here to take your aunt.

1482
01:58:43,916 --> 01:58:45,918
But you're here to arrange
her daughters' marriages.

1483
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:03,977
I didn't get why they fired you
in Dubai after saving their family.

1484
01:59:04,270 --> 01:59:07,149
Why should anyone give up good man?

1485
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:09,250
I've started understanding it.

1486
01:59:09,542 --> 01:59:11,647
We offer prayer to tree
and call it as God,

1487
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:14,753
but it grows on our house wall,
we cut it.

1488
01:59:18,017 --> 01:59:19,621
Marriages are happening
because of you.

1489
01:59:20,786 --> 01:59:24,131
But if that elderly man gets
irritated with you,

1490
01:59:24,457 --> 01:59:25,959
marriages would get cancelled.

1491
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:30,605
Siddu, you're like medicine.

1492
01:59:32,665 --> 01:59:34,338
It too has expiry date.

1493
01:59:38,571 --> 01:59:40,141
I think you'd have understood me.

1494
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:22,723
Father!

1495
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:24,460
Grandpa is not well!

1496
02:00:25,184 --> 02:00:27,926
BP is ﬂuctuating rapidly
for the last two days.

1497
02:00:28,387 --> 02:00:31,561
Since morning he's struggling
to breathe.

1498
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:32,794
He's being given oxygen.

1499
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:39,771
Come back, Gautham.

1500
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:41,844
Forget your aunt,

1501
02:00:42,368 --> 02:00:45,747
at least be here to see your
grandpa for the last time.

1502
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:48,846
No use in me seeing him,
he must see aunt.

1503
02:00:49,675 --> 02:00:50,619
I'll bring her.

1504
02:00:50,843 --> 02:00:52,982
I'll bring aunt on his birthday.

1505
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:55,181
I'll keep up my promise.

1506
02:00:55,615 --> 02:00:57,959
Tell him to stay alive till then
and keep his word.

1507
02:01:00,653 --> 02:01:02,655
Can you hear me?
Tell this in his ears.

1508
02:01:02,822 --> 02:01:04,733
Tell him to stay alive
till I come back.

1509
02:01:06,359 --> 02:01:07,633
Tell him to be alive!

1510
02:01:14,967 --> 02:01:16,537
One opportunity!

1511
02:01:18,838 --> 02:01:19,782
Just one!

1512
02:01:25,878 --> 02:01:28,222
He brought me as simple as
bringing a suitcase.

1513
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:32,761
“ﬂay are you praising him so much?

1514
02:01:32,918 --> 02:01:34,591
As ifhe won a war against Pakistan.

1515
02:01:34,754 --> 02:01:36,927
“ﬂay are you so jealous?

1516
02:01:37,323 --> 02:01:39,997
Stay here for few more minutes,
your husband will get jealous. Go!

1517
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:43,971
You're number one is
spoiling any occasion.

1518
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:50,403
Sashi, please reduce your anger.

1519
02:01:50,936 --> 02:01:52,916
Because your ﬁancﬁ is little mad.

1520
02:01:54,807 --> 02:01:55,478
So, better cool it off.

1521
02:01:56,075 --> 02:01:57,486
Whom should I marry then?

1522
02:01:59,445 --> 02:02:00,423
Whom should I marry?

1523
02:02:01,614 --> 02:02:04,060
Should I marry one who takes me
into his lap and talks?

1524
02:02:05,384 --> 02:02:07,660
Should I marry one who feeds me fondly?

1525
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:10,894
Surprised to know
how I remember all this!

1526
02:02:11,057 --> 02:02:11,660
Yes.

1527
02:02:12,658 --> 02:02:14,729
Beat that nurse and <i>he...</i>

1528
02:02:14,927 --> 02:02:16,998
Do you know what my problem is?
You!

1529
02:02:19,265 --> 02:02:22,269
The day you entered home,
I liked you!

1530
02:02:26,372 --> 02:02:27,851
I fell ﬂat on sight!

1531
02:02:29,008 --> 02:02:30,612
What do you want, Sashi?

1532
02:02:31,077 --> 02:02:32,522
Little peace of mind.

1533
02:02:40,486 --> 02:02:41,658
Bloody eyes!

1534
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:44,460
Though I don't want,
it's entering my dreams too.

1535
02:02:44,623 --> 02:02:46,068
Can I marry a driver for that?

1536
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:50,031
My sister is marrying an MBA!

1537
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:52,539
Her children would study in Oakridge!

1538
02:02:53,466 --> 02:02:55,537
Will my children study
in Municipal school?

1539
02:02:57,603 --> 02:02:59,879
That's why I used to shout
at you wantonly.

1540
02:03:01,307 --> 02:03:03,981
Go away man!
From my heart and my home!

1541
02:03:04,777 --> 02:03:09,658
When I come near you,
I‘ll get strange dirty thoughts!

1542
02:03:12,852 --> 02:03:14,297
My heart beat races!

1543
02:03:16,655 --> 02:03:18,191
Cheeks turn warm!

1544
02:03:19,658 --> 02:03:20,728
Legs start shivering.

1545
02:03:21,026 --> 02:03:22,004
Now also!

1546
02:03:22,294 --> 02:03:25,207
I'm wearing long skirt,
nobody can see it.

1547
02:03:25,364 --> 02:03:26,900
I didn't want to tell you.

1548
02:03:27,433 --> 02:03:29,071
Anyway you don't have
an entry into my home.

1549
02:03:29,235 --> 02:03:31,806
There's no way we can meet again.
That's why I told you.

1550
02:03:33,606 --> 02:03:34,744
I've to tell you one more thing.

1551
02:03:38,444 --> 02:03:39,354
Close your ears!

1552
02:03:40,813 --> 02:03:42,815
I said I want to tell.
Did I say you must hear it?

1553
02:03:49,789 --> 02:03:51,325
Go to hell!

1554
02:04:19,084 --> 02:04:21,360
So, I want to sing this new song...

1555
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:43,981
Hey girl! You knocked me outwith
just a slip oftongue...

1556
02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:48,652
Hey Monster princess, you said
I love you biting your teeth...

1557
02:04:48,881 --> 02:04:53,091
You laid a beautiful <i>trap...</i>
Your love gun shot hit my heart...

1558
02:04:53,252 --> 02:04:57,701
Which is right and which is left"?
I'm intoxicated without having a drink...

1559
02:04:57,823 --> 02:05:02,670
Like using cat ball to spread jasmine...
Like a bomb blew under my shirt pocket...

1560
02:05:02,828 --> 02:05:04,739
I'm getting crazy ideas...

1561
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:10,245
You made me go bonkers...

1562
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:49,278
Your lips are strawberries...
Yourwords are Cadburyk...

1563
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:55,158
You're a walking nursery of
ﬂowers ofbeauty...

1564
02:05:55,314 --> 02:05:58,921
Colourful gallery of dreams
in my eyes...

1565
02:05:59,285 --> 02:06:04,359
Your mischievous eyes are
ﬁlled with intoxicants...

1566
02:06:04,523 --> 02:06:06,366
Aunfs daughter has spread
charm of fragrance...

1567
02:06:06,525 --> 02:06:08,801
Offer diamonds on your
beautiful smile...

1568
02:06:08,961 --> 02:06:13,410
I'll hug as new found love
is taking over me...

1569
02:06:47,466 --> 02:06:52,279
I'm in chaos like sound blast
in Goddess kali festival...

1570
02:06:52,438 --> 02:06:56,614
I'm feeling like I've had
drug laced Bengali sweet...

1571
02:06:56,775 --> 02:07:01,315
Wearing a cowboy's dress...
Riding the horse of Rayalu...

1572
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:05,690
Staying put on earth...
I feel like stepping one <i>moon...</i>

1573
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:08,661
Getting incoming calls in
a cell without SIM card...

1574
02:07:08,821 --> 02:07:10,425
Using coal ofSingareni
as face powder...

1575
02:07:10,589 --> 02:07:12,899
I'm getting such crazy ideas...

1576
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:52,570
Unlike me, tie your husband
to apron strings like your mother.

1577
02:07:52,765 --> 02:07:55,268
You won't spare sister-in-law
even in blessing.

1578
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:59,310
Isn't it little diﬂicult t0 bless
for someone who scolds always?

1579
02:08:00,272 --> 02:08:01,182
Madam!

1580
02:08:02,041 --> 02:08:03,315
You keep pounding!

1581
02:08:05,444 --> 02:08:07,515
It's me Siddappa!

1582
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:10,217
I called to tell you something.

1583
02:08:10,382 --> 02:08:11,759
Tell me, brother.

1584
02:08:11,884 --> 02:08:14,592
Bhaskar, my nephew.

1585
02:08:16,155 --> 02:08:18,499
He's coming to your house
tomorrow morning.

1586
02:08:18,657 --> 02:08:22,298
He must conduct this marriage.
Thafs it!

1587
02:08:22,494 --> 02:08:23,495
<i>Saddam Bhaskat‘.!</i>

1588
02:08:23,929 --> 02:08:25,670
He went to Uganda with just
Rs.2 lakhs investment,

1589
02:08:25,864 --> 02:08:27,707
he bought a l0 acre farm,
he ploughed the land,

1590
02:08:27,866 --> 02:08:29,106
he hit a diamond mine!

1591
02:08:29,268 --> 02:08:30,576
With one shot, he hit big time.

1592
02:08:30,736 --> 02:08:34,650
That's all, in 5 years he made
nearly Rs.50000 crores.

1593
02:08:44,583 --> 02:08:46,620
Dry and use it! Don't lose it!

1594
02:08:47,753 --> 02:08:48,823
Rs.2 lakhs as tip!

1595
02:08:48,987 --> 02:08:50,489
Why are you surprised for this?

1596
02:08:50,656 --> 02:08:52,932
He has a wish to win
the coveted Oscar too.

1597
02:08:53,092 --> 02:08:54,036
$0 Way!

1598
02:08:54,193 --> 02:08:57,800
So, he instituted Bhaskar Award
and produced a film.

1599
02:08:57,963 --> 02:08:59,567
Film? Whafs the ﬁlm?

1600
02:08:59,765 --> 02:09:02,905
Inspired by Gladiator,
he made a ﬁlm Radiator!

1601
02:09:21,954 --> 02:09:24,332
He's the director and
he's the hero!

1602
02:09:24,623 --> 02:09:26,068
Our bad luck <i>is...</i>

1603
02:09:26,225 --> 02:09:27,397
<i>...he</i> plays the heroine too!

1604
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:29,464
That dirty thing!

1605
02:09:38,537 --> 02:09:41,780
If I didn't have my morn and
dad's blessings,

1606
02:09:42,775 --> 02:09:44,277
I wouldn't have reached this stage,

1607
02:09:45,277 --> 02:09:46,847
when people who watched this ﬁlm,

1608
02:09:47,346 --> 02:09:50,850
and said each scene is
like a diamond,

1609
02:09:51,750 --> 02:09:56,199
Tear are rolling down
from my eyes.

1610
02:09:56,355 --> 02:09:57,333
Why will you not cry?

1611
02:09:57,489 --> 02:10:00,060
You had to sell 60 diamonds
to ﬁnish the ﬁlm, right?

1612
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:07,704
You must know another
detail about him.

1613
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:08,674
Madam!

1614
02:10:08,901 --> 02:10:12,144
Rs.2 lakh investment
he stole it from this home only.

1615
02:10:13,672 --> 02:10:15,652
He worked in your place only.

1616
02:10:19,845 --> 02:10:21,984
Boss, I've news for you.

1617
02:10:22,281 --> 02:10:23,954
Some Bhaskar is coming and

1618
02:10:24,116 --> 02:10:26,960
people here are tensed
he may cancel the marriage.

1619
02:10:27,352 --> 02:10:29,889
Now your aunt will know the
value ofboss.

1620
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:36,640
What would we get ifshés sad?

1621
02:10:36,795 --> 02:10:39,207
She must realise and
must come with us.

1622
02:10:39,364 --> 02:10:40,638
That's our goal, right?

1623
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:45,213
'V110 can stop us if we enter aunt's
house along with Bhaskar?

1624
02:10:45,370 --> 02:10:47,372
Who can stop us?
Nobody can stop us.

1625
02:10:47,539 --> 02:10:48,517
That's why do one thing.

1626
02:10:48,674 --> 02:10:49,744
What do you want me to do, sir?

1627
02:10:49,908 --> 02:10:53,446
As soon as Bhaskar lands in India,
we must buy a job with him.

1628
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:54,852
Diﬂicult, sir.

1629
02:10:56,381 --> 02:11:00,830
Difficult but we can buy, before I could
complete, why did you slap me?

1630
02:11:02,821 --> 02:11:04,767
I'm getting irritated
forgiving a pause,

1631
02:11:04,957 --> 02:11:07,563
how dare you give
an explanation for that!

1632
02:11:08,493 --> 02:11:09,369
Bloody fool!

1633
02:11:20,839 --> 02:11:21,977
The place where I worked once!

1634
02:11:25,410 --> 02:11:26,889
People who threw me out!

1635
02:11:29,047 --> 02:11:31,391
Why are they looking at me surprised?

1636
02:11:31,516 --> 02:11:32,790
Looking at you!

1637
02:11:33,685 --> 02:11:34,993
What are you doing here?

1638
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:37,691
That <i>is...</i>
- He? He's my personal.

1639
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:39,665
He was working with us
till recently.

1640
02:11:39,825 --> 02:11:42,704
Ifhe quits job with you,
he'll become a good man like this.

1641
02:11:42,861 --> 02:11:46,172
If you throw anyone out,
he would become a great man like me.

1642
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:48,771
Have it.
- Why?

1643
02:11:48,934 --> 02:11:51,346
I got rank!
- Is it?

1644
02:11:51,503 --> 02:11:53,244
I'll throw up if I eat this.

1645
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:56,450
Buy new clothes.

1646
02:11:56,575 --> 02:11:57,918
Sir, that's Rs.2 lakhs!

1647
02:11:59,912 --> 02:12:02,984
You stole the same amount from this
house and got kicked out, right?

1648
02:12:03,148 --> 02:12:05,651
If you kick, gate too would
return in double speed.

1649
02:12:06,485 --> 02:12:07,987
That's why I came with this speed.

1650
02:12:12,157 --> 02:12:15,036
I love music!
- I love women!

1651
02:12:15,627 --> 02:12:16,901
Every man has his wish!

1652
02:12:17,095 --> 02:12:18,369
Making a statement for it.

1653
02:12:19,865 --> 02:12:20,741
Have it.

1654
02:12:20,966 --> 02:12:23,810
How come your cheeks have
become s0 chubby?

1655
02:12:23,969 --> 02:12:26,472
Using any medicine?
- Yes, I'm using Homeo.

1656
02:12:26,638 --> 02:12:27,912
Continue it.

1657
02:12:29,942 --> 02:12:37,759
How many children?
- Two!

1658
02:12:37,916 --> 02:12:39,293
You're maintaining body very well.

1659
02:12:39,985 --> 02:12:42,022
Why are you struggling?
What happened;

1660
02:12:42,154 --> 02:12:42,757
It's paining.

1661
02:12:42,921 --> 02:12:45,162
Won't I feel pain if I hold?

1662
02:12:48,493 --> 02:12:50,666
Says painful, don't I know that?

1663
02:12:50,829 --> 02:12:57,747
Sir, I've understood now why people clap
for hero when he heats the villain.

1664
02:12:58,003 --> 02:12:59,846
Hair rising!

1665
02:13:03,408 --> 02:13:05,615
How are you?

1666
02:13:10,615 --> 02:13:11,958
I think she's coming
to hug you, sir.

1667
02:13:12,117 --> 02:13:13,892
It's better to put ﬁnger in plug.

1668
02:13:14,086 --> 02:13:15,588
It's been years since I saw you.

1669
02:13:15,754 --> 02:13:18,200
If I knew you'd miss me so much,
I'd have sent my photo.

1670
02:13:18,323 --> 02:13:19,563
Carry on with your cooking.

1671
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:21,603
Thank God, she's gone.

1672
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:34,180
She was really ugly as
a little girl in gowns.

1673
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:37,181
How come she has grown
to be s0 sexy!

1674
02:13:39,011 --> 02:13:39,682
Whafs that?

1675
02:13:41,413 --> 02:13:44,087
I'll give only expressions,
you must do the job.

1676
02:13:46,918 --> 02:13:47,726
Wait, I'll clear it.

1677
02:13:53,291 --> 02:13:56,397
Hello Bhaskar!
- Greetings, madam.

1678
02:13:56,995 --> 02:13:59,635
How do you do?
- Doing ﬁne, madam.

1679
02:14:14,813 --> 02:14:16,656
I've little work, I'll be back.

1680
02:14:16,882 --> 02:14:17,792
Okay, madam.

1681
02:14:19,117 --> 02:14:20,687
Why did you do that sir?

1682
02:14:20,852 --> 02:14:22,490
What did I do?
- You bowed to her.

1683
02:14:22,654 --> 02:14:24,861
I did it involuntarily.

1684
02:14:29,961 --> 02:14:33,841
Bhaskar, your uncle Siddappa
told about you on phone.

1685
02:14:33,965 --> 02:14:35,410
You must conduct the marriage.

1686
02:14:37,536 --> 02:14:40,016
How much are you expecting from me?

1687
02:14:42,407 --> 02:14:43,681
Little bit of civility!

1688
02:14:45,577 --> 02:14:46,419
Civility?

1689
02:14:46,578 --> 02:14:48,580
Goddess of Wealth wants
to enter his home,

1690
02:14:48,747 --> 02:14:52,251
why is he talking about rules,
regulations and signals?

1691
02:14:52,417 --> 02:14:55,296
He insulted you and hurt us, sir.

1692
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:58,993
That's why we stop this marriage
and celebrate it.

1693
02:14:59,191 --> 02:15:00,363
Have some water.

1694
02:15:00,692 --> 02:15:02,262
Did you see the younger daughter?

1695
02:15:06,865 --> 02:15:08,936
If you want her,
you need to meet a man.

1696
02:15:09,101 --> 02:15:09,704
<i>who?</i>

1697
02:15:44,069 --> 02:15:46,879
With a smile and
blessing the devotees...

1698
02:15:47,038 --> 02:15:49,416
<i>And love his devotees...</i>

1699
02:15:49,875 --> 02:15:55,154
You're rocking... O Babaji...

1700
02:15:55,313 --> 02:15:57,987
Changing lungis and
wearing it as shirt...

1701
02:15:58,116 --> 02:16:00,494
When you bend down...

1702
02:16:06,525 --> 02:16:09,870
Life without you is nothing
but darkness...

1703
02:16:11,763 --> 02:16:15,176
If you don't smile,
I'm in chaos...

1704
02:16:17,869 --> 02:16:22,113
A bottle ofscent or a bottle ofliquor
is nothing compared to your eyes...

1705
02:16:22,274 --> 02:16:24,117
You're one of a kind
in this world...

1706
02:16:46,031 --> 02:16:47,635
Move. . . move. . . move...

1707
02:16:48,867 --> 02:16:54,545
<i>Plantain leaf for food...
tobacco for lime...</i>

1708
02:16:54,706 --> 02:16:59,177
Touch Swarny's holy feet
for washing off sins...

1709
02:17:36,781 --> 02:17:37,851
Whafs that tree?

1710
02:17:38,116 --> 02:17:40,289
Baba got enlightened under that tree.

1711
02:17:40,418 --> 02:17:42,591
That's why it is known as Wisdom tree.

1712
02:17:43,021 --> 02:17:45,729
Friends, devotees of God!

1713
02:17:46,891 --> 02:17:50,532
People plough to raise paddy!
But you ploughed to get diamonds.

1714
02:17:50,695 --> 02:17:51,935
What else do you want, son?

1715
02:17:52,063 --> 02:17:55,101
Just because hunger is satiated,
do we stop begging, Swamy?

1716
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:57,539
I've three wishes.
- “7hat's that?

1717
02:17:57,702 --> 02:17:59,272
I'm here to attend a marriage.

1718
02:17:59,904 --> 02:18:03,442
Sashimshe mustn't get married!

1719
02:18:03,708 --> 02:18:04,778
It won't happen!

1720
02:18:04,976 --> 02:18:06,046
I want her.

1721
02:18:06,211 --> 02:18:09,886
She'll marrywhich no one can imagine,
is it okay to you, son?

1722
02:18:10,582 --> 02:18:14,359
Since I won't imagine she'll
marry me, s0 she's all mine.

1723
02:18:16,187 --> 02:18:16,756
What else?

1724
02:18:17,322 --> 02:18:20,531
<i>My</i> mines and my diamonds,
my currency and my arrogancy,

1725
02:18:20,692 --> 02:18:21,966
they must always be with me.

1726
02:18:22,127 --> 02:18:25,802
What you started with would
always be with you, Baddam!

1727
02:18:26,031 --> 02:18:27,476
Son Baddam!
- Swamy!

1728
02:18:27,632 --> 02:18:31,671
To make all yourwishes come true,
the tree must be in your home.

1729
02:18:32,604 --> 02:18:33,480
Tree?

1730
02:18:33,638 --> 02:18:35,640
Almond tree in the backyard
ofBhaskaﬂs home!

1731
02:18:35,807 --> 02:18:38,913
It'll lift you up
from diﬂiculties!

1732
02:18:40,245 --> 02:18:43,590
Car can't hold it, Swarny!
- It'll come in air.

1733
02:18:44,749 --> 02:18:47,525
Ever since I came I’ve seen only
applying dot and combing hair,

1734
02:18:47,686 --> 02:18:49,393
I'm yet to see your face, Swamy!

1735
02:18:49,688 --> 02:18:51,793
Show mercy on me and
show your face <i>once...</i>

1736
02:18:53,958 --> 02:18:55,028
I beg you!

1737
02:18:55,293 --> 02:18:58,763
Can you bear if I turn?

1738
02:18:59,064 --> 02:19:00,134
I'm turning now!
- Turning!

1739
02:19:00,298 --> 02:19:03,279
Don't blame me for the consequences.
- I‘ll not.

1740
02:19:06,738 --> 02:19:09,150
I can't see anything.
- Die too!

1741
02:19:09,307 --> 02:19:11,344
New devotee has been blessed
with Babds divine glimpse!

1742
02:19:11,509 --> 02:19:14,080
Hail Balm!
- It's your good fortune!

1743
02:19:14,245 --> 02:19:15,849
You had the glimpse ofBaba
on your ﬁrst visit.

1744
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:39,974
“ﬂay so many covers?

1745
02:19:46,244 --> 02:19:50,215
If you lie, leaves will fall,
you'll die!

1746
02:19:50,882 --> 02:19:51,826
Let me test it.

1747
02:19:51,983 --> 02:19:53,519
I look like Mahesh Babu.

1748
02:19:57,622 --> 02:19:58,965
Leaves fell, sir.

1749
02:19:59,157 --> 02:20:00,363
I can see it.

1750
02:20:02,994 --> 02:20:05,565
I'm very intelligent.

1751
02:20:06,631 --> 02:20:08,838
Fell again.
- Fell, you lied.

1752
02:20:11,636 --> 02:20:13,741
I'm an idiot!
- That's true, sir.

1753
02:20:14,339 --> 02:20:16,216
Not a leave fell, so...
- I can see that.

1754
02:20:16,374 --> 02:20:17,011
Why are you telling me?

1755
02:20:17,175 --> 02:20:20,486
“ﬂay did you come here?
Go away from here.

1756
02:20:24,416 --> 02:20:25,895
I don't want you.

1757
02:20:26,985 --> 02:20:28,828
No, . .go away!

1758
02:20:29,821 --> 02:20:30,595
May I go awn'?

1759
02:20:32,891 --> 02:20:33,699
Where do you want me to g0?

1760
02:20:35,593 --> 02:20:36,697
Go away!

1761
02:20:41,433 --> 02:20:42,173
Go away!

1762
02:20:43,802 --> 02:20:44,712
Who is there?

1763
02:20:47,038 --> 02:20:48,278
What? What happened?

1764
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:49,441
Asking me what happened?

1765
02:20:49,607 --> 02:20:51,314
Is it respectable house
or public garden?

1766
02:20:51,476 --> 02:20:53,456
What happened, sir?
- Asking me what has happened?

1767
02:20:53,611 --> 02:20:55,454
A girl about to marry
is romancing servant...

1768
02:20:56,181 --> 02:20:59,424
Why are you looking shocked?
Am I narrating any epic?

1769
02:20:59,584 --> 02:21:00,858
They both were in each other's hug.

1770
02:21:01,019 --> 02:21:02,760
I think people watching it
would die getting suffocated.

1771
02:21:02,921 --> 02:21:04,366
What? Whafs your problem?

1772
02:21:07,559 --> 02:21:08,629
You were saying something.

1773
02:21:08,793 --> 02:21:09,999
Your girl is ﬁre!

1774
02:21:10,128 --> 02:21:11,198
Leaves didn't fall, sir.

1775
02:21:11,396 --> 02:21:12,374
I was wrong.

1776
02:21:12,697 --> 02:21:14,233
Did you observe one thing?
- Whafs it?

1777
02:21:14,365 --> 02:21:16,140
Leaves fell without wind blowing.

1778
02:21:16,301 --> 02:21:19,771
That too when you were talking
about a topic.

1779
02:21:19,938 --> 02:21:22,578
It didn't fell earlier and
then later, did you observe this?

1780
02:21:23,174 --> 02:21:25,279
I heard about mad people but seeing
them for the ﬁrst time in life.

1781
02:21:25,443 --> 02:21:26,046
I think he said something.

1782
02:21:26,211 --> 02:21:29,420
Nothing, your madam is calling.
- Is it? Coming, madam.

1783
02:21:29,714 --> 02:21:32,786
Is it false that girl and
our boy were hugging each other, sir?

1784
02:21:32,951 --> 02:21:34,897
It could be a lie.

1785
02:21:35,286 --> 02:21:40,258
But what I'm planning to do
with Sashi tonight is real.

1786
02:21:40,425 --> 02:21:42,029
Bhaskar loves arts.
- Is it?

1787
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:44,299
Who are they?

1788
02:21:44,462 --> 02:21:46,999
It means ﬁne arts not girls, sir.

1789
02:21:47,165 --> 02:21:50,806
Since you said ﬁne arts, I mean games
like medley ofsongs and tombola...

1790
02:21:50,969 --> 02:21:52,505
How about gilli, marbles and others!

1791
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:54,513
These are not arts!

1792
02:21:54,839 --> 02:21:55,749
Theatre!

1793
02:21:55,907 --> 02:21:57,181
It's on the verge of extinction.

1794
02:21:57,342 --> 02:21:58,343
We must give a new life to it.

1795
02:21:58,510 --> 02:21:59,955
He wants to get the second one to bed.

1796
02:22:00,111 --> 02:22:03,752
I too love theatre, sir.
- I‘ll make you perform it.

1797
02:22:03,915 --> 02:22:07,089
Whafs the play's name, sir?
- OAhaIya is innocent girl!

1798
02:22:07,252 --> 02:22:08,162
Then, we must ﬁnd two girls.

1799
02:22:08,319 --> 02:22:10,765
Ahalya and innocent are
not two girls.

1800
02:22:10,889 --> 02:22:12,869
Ahalya is innocent.

1801
02:22:13,625 --> 02:22:16,265
So much twist in title itselﬂ
You cunning fellow!

1802
02:22:16,427 --> 02:22:18,668
I‘ve plenty of twists in the story!

1803
02:22:18,830 --> 02:22:20,138
Whafs the concept, sir?

1804
02:22:20,265 --> 02:22:22,472
Gautham and Ahalya are a couple,

1805
02:22:23,701 --> 02:22:27,410
Indra loves Ahalya since a long time,
- Isn't it wrong, sir?

1806
02:22:27,572 --> 02:22:30,018
If he asks, Ahalya too would
say the same,

1807
02:22:30,174 --> 02:22:31,551
he made a plan,

1808
02:22:31,843 --> 02:22:34,722
before dawn breaks at 5 am,
by 4 <i>am...</i>

1809
02:22:37,815 --> 02:22:38,691
<i>...he</i> crowed like a rooster!

1810
02:22:38,883 --> 02:22:42,956
Gautham as usual took the towel
and left to river bank for bath.

1811
02:22:43,154 --> 02:22:46,601
Taking this opportunity,
Indra disguises himself as Gautham,

1812
02:22:46,758 --> 02:22:48,237
and goes to Ahalya,

1813
02:22:48,393 --> 02:22:50,532
seeing Ahalya with carnal desires,

1814
02:22:51,362 --> 02:22:54,741
he patted sleeping Ahalya
to wake her up.

1815
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:01,507
Enough of seeing me,
deliver your dialogue.

1816
02:23:03,408 --> 02:23:05,513
Swarny! Didn't you go to the river?

1817
02:23:06,244 --> 02:23:09,589
'VVhen you're in the room,
why would I go to river?

1818
02:23:09,747 --> 02:23:11,954
saying this he pushed her on the bed,

1819
02:23:12,116 --> 02:23:13,720
he passionately occupied her.

1820
02:23:22,393 --> 02:23:24,168
You went to take bath, right?
“ﬂay did you come so early?

1821
02:23:24,295 --> 02:23:27,572
Are you blind?
I took the towel but forgot soap.

1822
02:23:27,765 --> 02:23:29,745
I took a dip and came back.

1823
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:32,006
Take the soap and
have a good clean bath.

1824
02:23:32,170 --> 02:23:32,841
What?

1825
02:23:33,004 --> 02:23:35,746
I said take the soap and
have a good clean bath.

1826
02:23:35,907 --> 02:23:38,444
What would you do with
my wife meanwhile?

1827
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:40,112
I'm Indra, I can do anything.

1828
02:23:40,278 --> 02:23:42,781
Then, I'm Gautham.
I too can do anything.

1829
02:23:42,947 --> 02:23:46,690
I'll punch...pinch...bite...

1830
02:23:59,197 --> 02:24:01,905
Only one man beat me but
why do I feel like many hands?

1831
02:24:16,981 --> 02:24:18,324
Ahalya, where's my towel?

1832
02:24:26,057 --> 02:24:27,297
Patting shoulder...

1833
02:24:28,026 --> 02:24:30,472
If you pat as and where you wish,
why do you need me or script?

1834
02:24:31,362 --> 02:24:34,536
She got serious when I patted,
why is she laughing when he does it?

1835
02:24:35,199 --> 02:24:36,177
S-W 2!; 4;!

1836
02:24:36,334 --> 02:24:37,608
Didn't you go to the river?

1837
02:24:37,769 --> 02:24:40,613
You're in my heart,
how can I go to the river?

1838
02:24:41,272 --> 02:24:41,841
Good!

1839
02:24:42,006 --> 02:24:43,349
We used room, right?

1840
02:24:43,508 --> 02:24:44,748
I think he has improvised it.

1841
02:24:44,909 --> 02:24:46,149
Didn't you do it by patting
on buttocks?

1842
02:24:46,310 --> 02:24:48,256
How can you compare him with me?

1843
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:51,021
I'll show what improvisation is!
- Come, my dear...

1844
02:24:51,182 --> 02:24:52,991
I'm unable to bear this
separation, dear.

1845
02:24:53,151 --> 02:24:54,653
<i>Phase imprison me in your arms.</i>

1846
02:24:54,819 --> 02:24:56,093
Whafs this?
- Please do something.

1847
02:24:56,254 --> 02:24:59,167
Whafs this?
Leave her!

1848
02:25:00,158 --> 02:25:01,159
Whafs this?

1849
02:25:01,726 --> 02:25:04,229
Didn't you take bath in river?
- Am I like you?

1850
02:25:04,362 --> 02:25:06,672
No bath, I just washed my face,
that's all.

1851
02:25:07,498 --> 02:25:08,704
“ﬂay didn't you show this
intelligence before?

1852
02:25:08,866 --> 02:25:11,039
What are you saying?

1853
02:25:11,202 --> 02:25:14,740
You've such a big watch on hand,
ifrooster cocks,

1854
02:25:14,906 --> 02:25:17,079
if you leave a sleeping wife,
- So what?

1855
02:25:17,241 --> 02:25:18,743
people like me would get
into the bed with her, right?

1856
02:25:18,910 --> 02:25:21,220
What are you blabbering?

1857
02:25:21,379 --> 02:25:22,221
Whafs that?

1858
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:23,886
Whafs that?

1859
02:25:24,115 --> 02:25:27,187
“ﬂay are you raising your voice?
- I'll raise my hand also.

1860
02:25:30,755 --> 02:25:33,702
Why are you beating me?
- Not just beat, I’ll bite you.

1861
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:54,187
This time, I'll play Ahalya.

1862
02:25:54,312 --> 02:25:55,518
Fight and kill yourselves.

1863
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:58,422
You get up-“get "P'"

1864
02:26:01,185 --> 02:26:02,129
Has it dawned s0 quickly?

1865
02:26:02,286 --> 02:26:03,230
Why are you sleeping like
a log, Ahalya?

1866
02:26:03,387 --> 02:26:04,229
Where's my towel?

1867
02:26:06,023 --> 02:26:07,229
Pat on the shoulders.

1868
02:26:08,192 --> 02:26:09,330
Should you pat him also there?

1869
02:26:09,494 --> 02:26:11,371
What sex appeal does he have?

1870
02:26:13,064 --> 02:26:14,566
Didn't you go to river?

1871
02:26:14,866 --> 02:26:17,608
When y0u‘re in room,
what would I do in the river?

1872
02:26:18,703 --> 02:26:21,274
Come.
- You come closer.

1873
02:26:24,742 --> 02:26:25,720
With whom you're having an affair?

1874
02:26:25,877 --> 02:26:28,118
With whom you're having an affair?
- Didn't you go to take bath?

1875
02:26:28,279 --> 02:26:31,453
I did go but suspected you're having
an affairwith someone I came back.

1876
02:26:31,616 --> 02:26:32,424
Come, this side.
- Okay.

1877
02:26:32,583 --> 02:26:33,493
Why don't you beat him?

1878
02:26:33,651 --> 02:26:36,461
I'll beat him but
first I'll beat you.

1879
02:26:36,621 --> 02:26:39,067
I‘ll beat him later
but tell me one thing,

1880
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:39,691
Wh
afs it?

1881
02:26:39,891 --> 02:26:43,134
You're mywife for 25 years, right?
- Yes.

1882
02:26:43,294 --> 02:26:46,298
If so, can‘t you differentiate
between husband and paramour?

1883
02:26:46,464 --> 02:26:48,671
I mean...
- Go ahead.

1884
02:26:48,866 --> 02:26:51,278
<i>I mean...</i>
- You're crossing limits.

1885
02:26:51,435 --> 02:26:54,143
Do you know what would I do
with women like you <i>?</i>

1886
02:26:54,305 --> 02:26:55,807
D0 you know what would I do?
- What will you do?

1887
02:26:55,973 --> 02:26:57,247
May I tell you?
- Tell me.

1888
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:59,410
I'll tell you...

1889
02:26:59,577 --> 02:27:01,318
Not just beat, I must bite you.

1890
02:27:01,479 --> 02:27:02,981
Bite...bite...

1891
02:27:09,153 --> 02:27:11,155
Do you need the role ofAhalya
for your beauty?

1892
02:27:11,756 --> 02:27:13,531
Why this dangerous desire at this age?

1893
02:27:15,293 --> 02:27:16,738
I got it now.

1894
02:27:17,495 --> 02:27:20,738
I'm just a spectator!
Fight and kill yourselves.

1895
02:27:20,898 --> 02:27:23,174
Please entertain me.
That's all!

1896
02:27:27,071 --> 02:27:29,108
Dawned s0 quickly?
Where's the towel?

1897
02:27:43,087 --> 02:27:45,328
I'll see how can he beat me!

1898
02:27:45,523 --> 02:27:46,763
I'll also see, sir.

1899
02:27:48,659 --> 02:27:51,037
She's senseless anyway!
What happened to you?

1900
02:27:51,195 --> 02:27:52,173
You know she's not your wife, right?

1901
02:27:52,330 --> 02:27:55,539
Will you beat her now?
- Not her but you...you...

1902
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:01,381
Actually I mustn't beat you.

1903
02:28:06,711 --> 02:28:09,157
Do you know what's happening here?
- I wrote the play, right?

1904
02:28:10,147 --> 02:28:11,057
Right;

1905
02:28:11,582 --> 02:28:14,654
Is he her husband?
- No, he's Indra.

1906
02:28:14,819 --> 02:28:16,355
In such a scene,

1907
02:28:16,487 --> 02:28:21,129
Ahalya, the man who has come now
is not your husband Gautham,

1908
02:28:21,292 --> 02:28:23,169
he's treacherous rogue Indra,

1909
02:28:23,327 --> 02:28:25,170
instead of telling her the truth,

1910
02:28:25,329 --> 02:28:28,674
pushing your pot belly up and
pushing everything else behind,

1911
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:30,836
what are you watching legs
wide spread and moving it?

1912
02:28:32,703 --> 02:28:34,910
Will you beat me for this point too?

1913
02:28:35,072 --> 02:28:38,144
I'll beat you on any point.

1914
02:28:38,309 --> 02:28:41,153
The nation is facing so much ﬂak
because ofpeople like you.

1915
02:28:41,312 --> 02:28:42,256
Thrash him!

1916
02:28:45,816 --> 02:28:48,820
<i>KatamatayudumKadiﬂNatasimha...</i>

1917
02:28:54,659 --> 02:28:57,902
Great hunter, I trust <i>you...</i>

1918
02:29:00,765 --> 02:29:02,938
O lord, you rule over <i>me...</i>

1919
02:29:06,404 --> 02:29:11,251
You mauled the devil with anger...

1920
02:29:17,748 --> 02:29:22,527
Taking on the might...

1921
02:29:23,754 --> 02:29:29,932
You gave the education of
Brahmins to Brahmadevara...

1922
02:29:48,012 --> 02:29:50,720
I beg you, madam,
I think he'll kill me.

1923
02:29:50,881 --> 02:29:52,326
Please send him out.

1924
02:29:52,416 --> 02:29:54,453
Why are you raising hell?
Come here.

1925
02:29:59,023 --> 02:30:01,264
I want to talk to you,
please come in.

1926
02:30:11,769 --> 02:30:13,077
What are you up to?

1927
02:30:13,571 --> 02:30:16,177
If Bhaskar gets irritated
he may tell his uncle,

1928
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:17,751
and stop this marriage,

1929
02:30:18,275 --> 02:30:19,948
can you take that responsibility?

1930
02:30:21,645 --> 02:30:23,283
You want Sunanda.

1931
02:30:24,148 --> 02:30:26,822
But the woman here is Sunanda Shekar.

1932
02:30:28,185 --> 02:30:32,292
Shekarwoulddt get separated from my name,
Sunanda will not come to your home.

1933
02:30:34,992 --> 02:30:39,099
Go away. . . from this home
and our lives!

1934
02:31:06,457 --> 02:31:08,903
Did you get the entire list, Priest?
- Yes, sir.

1935
02:31:09,093 --> 02:31:10,868
Why aren't you still ready?

1936
02:31:11,729 --> 02:31:13,402
Groom's people would be here
in an hour.

1937
02:31:13,564 --> 02:31:14,872
Does she really like this marriage?

1938
02:31:15,066 --> 02:31:17,012
You're not having any
secret twists, right?

1939
02:31:18,369 --> 02:31:20,440
Why don't you answer your uncle?

1940
02:31:21,605 --> 02:31:25,348
Alarm failed t0 ring,
why are you getting tensed for this?

1941
02:31:27,611 --> 02:31:28,681
Amulu, come here.

1942
02:31:30,014 --> 02:31:31,925
<i>Saris are upstairs...</i>
- <i>Madam...</i>

1943
02:31:33,317 --> 02:31:34,227
D eﬁnitely.

1944
02:31:34,785 --> 02:31:35,559
I'll come.

1945
02:31:36,554 --> 02:31:38,261
I said I’ll come.

1946
02:31:40,191 --> 02:31:40,896
Cut it.

1947
02:31:41,392 --> 02:31:42,200
Cut the call.

1948
02:32:06,283 --> 02:32:07,956
Sashi sister is missing.

1949
02:32:08,152 --> 02:32:08,926
Her clothes and jewels too
are missing.

1950
02:32:09,086 --> 02:32:11,532
What else?
She would've eloped with Siddu.

1951
02:32:14,892 --> 02:32:16,701
How do you know?

1952
02:32:18,462 --> 02:32:20,738
Like this, she said that before me.

1953
02:32:21,031 --> 02:32:22,635
“ﬂay didn't you tell me that earlier?

1954
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:27,874
I thought she would forget her love
and marry the man chosen by <i>you...</i>

1955
02:32:35,579 --> 02:32:38,219
Earlier he took away future
son-in-law now future daughter-in-law.

1956
02:32:38,482 --> 02:32:40,792
You said you sent him out ofhome.

1957
02:32:40,951 --> 02:32:42,862
Who brought him here again?

1958
02:32:45,122 --> 02:32:46,567
I know a thing.

1959
02:32:46,690 --> 02:32:47,998
But I don't know ifit is
true or false.

1960
02:32:48,192 --> 02:32:50,763
Tell me the thing,
I‘ll give the explanation.

1961
02:32:50,928 --> 02:32:52,839
If it's lie, leaves will fall, uncle.

1962
02:32:52,963 --> 02:32:56,308
What do you lose if leaves fall?
Tree will die.

1963
02:32:56,467 --> 02:32:58,174
If tree dies,
I too would die, uncle.

1964
02:32:58,335 --> 02:32:59,313
Whafs that nonsense?

1965
02:32:59,470 --> 02:33:02,542
Not nonsense, I and tree are
one and same.

1966
02:33:06,844 --> 02:33:09,415
If you kill a bird with it,
you can at least eat it.

1967
02:33:09,580 --> 02:33:10,854
What will you get ifyou ﬁre at me?

1968
02:33:11,015 --> 02:33:12,926
If kept, I'll stink and
if you burn, just ash.

1969
02:33:13,083 --> 02:33:14,619
If you don't tell
what really had happened,

1970
02:33:14,785 --> 02:33:17,265
people will tell tales about you.

1971
02:33:22,726 --> 02:33:23,898
“ﬂay are you so dull?

1972
02:33:24,795 --> 02:33:26,172
Your mother told me to leave home.

1973
02:33:27,932 --> 02:33:30,378
Shall we both g0 away together?
- Where to?

1974
02:33:30,834 --> 02:33:31,471
How;

1975
02:33:32,970 --> 02:33:33,744
catch a train.

1976
02:33:33,904 --> 02:33:36,612
They'll know from my hotel desk
if it is ﬂight.

1977
02:33:38,342 --> 02:33:39,548
Can you live with a driver like me?

1978
02:33:40,911 --> 02:33:41,719
Any doubt?

1979
02:33:42,947 --> 02:33:44,051
I don't want anything.

1980
02:33:44,882 --> 02:33:45,553
True!

1981
02:33:47,051 --> 02:33:50,521
4 0r 5 crores is enough.
- 4 or 5 crates?

1982
02:33:51,288 --> 02:33:52,198
We need to live, right?

1983
02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:04,843
I didn't tell any lie now, right?

1984
02:34:05,002 --> 02:34:08,108
It didn't fall for your lies
but Siddu used this remote control.

1985
02:34:10,241 --> 02:34:11,584
Thimmapur

1986
02:34:12,076 --> 02:34:13,987
Hail Lord Murugan!

1987
02:34:15,412 --> 02:34:20,725
Hail Lord Murugan!

1988
02:34:32,329 --> 02:34:33,774
What are you thinking?

1989
02:34:34,365 --> 02:34:36,504
There are many cars in Chennai
for you to drive.

1990
02:34:36,667 --> 02:34:39,273
There are many buildings
for me to design.

1991
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:45,652
If we don't find any job,
if we sell this necklace,

1992
02:34:45,809 --> 02:34:47,550
we can live recklessly for a year.

1993
02:34:47,711 --> 02:34:49,349
You don't get tensed.
Okay?

1994
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:52,459
Without wasting time,
ifwdve a son or daughter,

1995
02:34:52,616 --> 02:34:56,462
and send their photo,
my parents will come for us.

1996
02:35:56,313 --> 02:35:58,190
Sir, please give me alms!

1997
02:36:22,239 --> 02:36:24,549
A ticket to Mumbai please.
- This train goes to Madras.

1998
02:36:26,944 --> 02:36:28,048
Give me a ticket to some place, sir.

1999
02:36:28,212 --> 02:36:29,657
If you don't I may die.

2000
02:36:38,856 --> 02:36:39,857
Do you know to read Urdu?

2001
02:36:40,457 --> 02:36:42,232
After seeing him beating our men,

2002
02:36:42,426 --> 02:36:44,565
I've learnt Chinese and painting too.

2003
02:36:44,728 --> 02:36:45,365
Keep quiet.

2004
02:36:47,197 --> 02:36:49,199
Hail Lord Murugan!

2005
02:36:50,467 --> 02:36:52,572
Hail Lord Murugan!

2006
02:36:54,037 --> 02:36:57,109
Hail Lord Murugan!

2007
02:36:57,274 --> 02:36:58,912
Hail Lord Murugan!

2008
02:36:59,076 --> 02:37:04,424
Hail Lord Murugan!

2009
02:37:31,141 --> 02:37:35,112
Lord Jesus! I'm seeing him for
the first time in my life.

2010
02:37:35,913 --> 02:37:42,262
I made vow to visit Velankanni
Mary church on my knees.

2011
02:37:42,419 --> 02:37:43,762
These are my tickets.

2012
02:37:44,021 --> 02:37:46,365
This is certiﬁcate ofphysically handicap.

2013
02:37:47,791 --> 02:37:49,429
You beat me recently, right sir?

2014
02:37:49,893 --> 02:37:51,429
I lost two tooth.

2015
02:37:52,262 --> 02:37:55,471
Losing anything which God gave
would make me handicap, right?

2016
02:37:55,632 --> 02:37:57,634
That's why I got this certificate, sir.

2017
02:37:58,068 --> 02:37:59,308
Can I board the train?

2018
02:38:03,407 --> 02:38:05,318
Flight is ready, sir.

2019
02:38:05,609 --> 02:38:07,213
Why ﬂight?
Waste of money for ﬂight.

2020
02:38:07,377 --> 02:38:09,914
No need to buy tickets, he owns ﬂight.

2021
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:12,321
It is ready on runway now.

2022
02:38:14,451 --> 02:38:16,124
We've taken pennission to
bring cars on platform, sir.

2023
02:38:16,286 --> 02:38:17,287
No need.

2024
02:38:17,621 --> 02:38:18,964
Isn't Siddu a driver?

2025
02:38:19,122 --> 02:38:21,864
After seeing us, ify0u're
asking us this question,

2026
02:38:21,992 --> 02:38:23,994
I don't know ifyou're mad
or foolish!

2027
02:38:33,770 --> 02:38:35,511
Boss, they're here!

2028
02:38:39,510 --> 02:38:41,251
I want this station for 15 minutes.

2029
02:38:41,578 --> 02:38:44,024
If you ask suddenly now...

2030
02:38:44,381 --> 02:38:46,019
There's a price for everything, buy it.

2031
02:38:46,183 --> 02:38:46,957
What about the passengers?

2032
02:38:47,117 --> 02:38:48,494
Send them by special ﬂights.

2033
02:38:48,652 --> 02:38:50,325
If there are no airports,
send them by cars.

2034
02:38:50,487 --> 02:38:52,797
Send a message to Ministry,
request the station master.

2035
02:38:52,923 --> 02:38:55,164
Threaten him if he refuses,
if still he refuses, kill him.

2036
02:38:55,325 --> 02:38:58,135
This meeting is very important
for me...very important.

2037
02:38:58,262 --> 02:39:00,037
I'm giving you 5 minutes.

2038
02:39:32,195 --> 02:39:33,606
How dare you want my daughter!

2039
02:39:33,764 --> 02:39:35,402
Come heremcome...

2040
02:39:35,832 --> 02:39:39,405
Nobody can bridge the distance
between front and back seat of a car.

2041
02:39:40,203 --> 02:39:42,046
Aren't you ashamed of eloping
with a driver?

2042
02:39:42,205 --> 02:39:43,411
Leave her.

2043
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:45,916
See who is holding whom
and then speak!

2044
02:39:46,710 --> 02:39:50,180
How dare you answer me!
I‘ll kill you!

2045
02:39:53,817 --> 02:39:54,887
I'll kill you!

2046
02:40:04,494 --> 02:40:07,873
You'd be having a theorywhy a car
driver shouldn't marry your daughter,

2047
02:40:08,498 --> 02:40:12,446
why a penny worth lawyer shouldn't
marry his daughter,

2048
02:40:12,736 --> 02:40:15,580
her father shouldn't have
a theory, right?

2049
02:40:16,873 --> 02:40:19,353
You can go to his home after marrying.

2050
02:40:19,876 --> 02:40:22,447
But you can't bear to see
your daughter with a suitcase.

2051
02:40:25,315 --> 02:40:27,761
You'll exile a family for
getting shot on shoulder,

2052
02:40:28,051 --> 02:40:30,588
but you can point a gun on my head!

2053
02:40:30,821 --> 02:40:33,893
Yours is love and
what others do is desire!

2054
02:40:34,591 --> 02:40:37,197
If you do it is role model,
if others do, it‘s haste!

2055
02:40:37,928 --> 02:40:40,807
If you shout, it is affection,
if my grandpa shouts, it's arrogance.

2056
02:40:41,798 --> 02:40:42,640
Is
lit it?

2057
02:40:43,867 --> 02:40:44,811
Who are you?

2058
02:40:44,968 --> 02:40:48,609
The lady you married, I'm her nephew.

2059
02:40:49,306 --> 02:40:51,980
A man who is burning with
the memories,

2060
02:40:52,542 --> 02:40:53,577
I'm his son!

2061
02:40:54,177 --> 02:40:57,989
Grandson of a man is fighting death.

2062
02:40:59,049 --> 02:41:01,893
Thousands ofcrores,
factories in lo countries,

2063
02:41:02,285 --> 02:41:03,730
one lakh workers,

2064
02:41:04,388 --> 02:41:06,129
nothing of this gives us content,
we're just poor people.

2065
02:41:06,990 --> 02:41:08,128
Heir ofNandasl

2066
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:11,730
What has changed since then, aunt?

2067
02:41:11,995 --> 02:41:13,599
It was in grandpafs hand
and now he's carrying it.

2068
02:41:13,930 --> 02:41:14,931
Thafs the only difference, right?

2069
02:41:17,401 --> 02:41:20,507
If my grandpa was wrong then,
what you did now is also wrong,

2070
02:41:20,671 --> 02:41:21,615
leave your daughter,

2071
02:41:22,839 --> 02:41:23,840
I'll take her with me,

2072
02:41:24,675 --> 02:41:27,178
ify0u're right now,
then he was right that da!

2073
02:41:27,844 --> 02:41:29,619
You come with me,
I'll take you with me.

2074
02:41:30,914 --> 02:41:33,326
I'm telling you this to convince
with my intelligence, aunt.

2075
02:41:33,950 --> 02:41:36,658
My aim is to tell you and
grandpa both were wrong.

2076
02:41:37,954 --> 02:41:40,025
If the price of his haste
is losing you,

2077
02:41:41,258 --> 02:41:43,670
the price of your anger is losing
parents' home for 25 'years.

2078
02:41:45,762 --> 02:41:49,039
The day you left home,
had you turned for a second, aunt,

2079
02:41:49,399 --> 02:41:51,037
you'd have heard another shriek,

2080
02:41:55,372 --> 02:42:00,378
had you heard that shriek, these
25 years would've been different, aunt.

2081
02:42:01,111 --> 02:42:02,215
D ilferent!

2082
02:42:04,915 --> 02:42:09,796
You don't worry, brother.
I'll not file any case on your father.

2083
02:42:10,687 --> 02:42:11,324
Come.

2084
02:42:12,889 --> 02:42:13,993
What has happened to me?

2085
02:42:15,358 --> 02:42:17,895
Am I God if I make some money?

2086
02:42:19,629 --> 02:42:21,575
Would I shoot my own daughter?

2087
02:42:24,401 --> 02:42:26,074
Man like me mustn't live.

2088
02:42:27,571 --> 02:42:30,415
I'll die!

2089
02:42:31,141 --> 02:42:33,678
I'll die!
- Stop, father!

2090
02:42:34,544 --> 02:42:37,753
Enough of the disaster
this house has seen today.

2091
02:42:37,914 --> 02:42:40,190
If I die...
- No, father...

2092
02:42:40,350 --> 02:42:42,387
Please don't stop me.

2093
02:42:42,886 --> 02:42:46,390
No, father...
- Don't stop rne...don't stop me!

2094
02:42:46,556 --> 02:42:47,398
<i>Please father...</i>

2095
02:44:07,237 --> 02:44:09,513
You left grandpa for hurting
uncle's shoulder,

2096
02:44:10,140 --> 02:44:12,279
what should I do with grandpa
who killed my mother, aunt?

2097
02:44:13,810 --> 02:44:16,347
“ﬂay did a gun fire
which was silent for 10 years?

2098
02:44:16,546 --> 02:44:17,524
Isn't it because of you?

2099
02:44:17,948 --> 02:44:20,360
Hoe much I should hate you
and that old man?

2100
02:44:20,817 --> 02:44:22,194
But I didn't do like that.

2101
02:44:22,752 --> 02:44:24,322
I grew up holding his hand.

2102
02:44:25,188 --> 02:44:26,667
Just because he asked me,

2103
02:44:27,023 --> 02:44:29,435
I came to you as your driver
and opened the door for you.

2104
02:44:30,293 --> 02:44:32,136
Can't you come and open the
door of the home, aunt?

2105
02:44:34,531 --> 02:44:36,704
Every problem in life
gives us two ways,

2106
02:44:37,701 --> 02:44:40,705
one is ﬁlled with love
and another with hatred.

2107
02:44:41,738 --> 02:44:44,514
I chose the ﬁrst and
you chose the second way.

2108
02:44:45,809 --> 02:44:47,720
Come to my way once, aunt.

2109
02:44:48,411 --> 02:44:49,321
Just once!

2110
02:44:55,719 --> 02:44:58,859
As a child I didn't know
why I had no mother,

2111
02:44:59,823 --> 02:45:01,359
diddt understand why you won't come,

2112
02:45:02,626 --> 02:45:04,333
I used to be very angry, aunt,

2113
02:45:06,229 --> 02:45:09,403
I used to wage invisible war
with unseen enemy, aunt.

2114
02:45:09,633 --> 02:45:11,442
Invisible war!

2115
02:45:19,075 --> 02:45:21,282
Living good isn't living away,

2116
02:45:21,711 --> 02:45:23,748
live happily with relatives!

2117
02:45:24,748 --> 02:45:27,820
Though we earned a lot, we could never
ﬁll the void left by you, aunt.

2118
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:32,500
Still we keep a plate on dining table,

2119
02:45:32,956 --> 02:45:34,094
a room in our home,

2120
02:45:34,557 --> 02:45:36,730
25 paise ofevery rupee we earn,

2121
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:39,101
we've kept it for you, aunt.

2122
02:45:41,564 --> 02:45:43,305
We love you so much, aunt.

2123
02:45:44,534 --> 02:45:49,108
Just say one word, I‘ll stand guard
against all your diﬂiculties.

2124
02:45:50,507 --> 02:45:55,786
For one mistake, we've been saying
sorry for 25 long years, aunt.

2125
02:45:56,112 --> 02:45:57,557
We're saying sorry!

2126
02:45:58,882 --> 02:46:00,759
We can‘t wait anymore, aunt.

2127
02:46:01,418 --> 02:46:02,522
Can't wait anymore.

2128
02:46:03,286 --> 02:46:06,290
Ifpossible forgive us
or else punish us.

2129
02:46:07,390 --> 02:46:11,395
But please recognise us
for God's sake!

2130
02:46:40,590 --> 02:46:41,898
Make a call, Gautham.

2131
02:46:44,627 --> 02:46:46,800
I want to talk to my father.

2132
02:46:51,901 --> 02:46:53,005
I'm worried.

2133
02:46:59,609 --> 02:47:03,614
Where you win isn't great but
where to bend makes you greater!

2134
02:47:21,698 --> 02:47:23,644
He's no more a mother less child!

2135
02:47:24,367 --> 02:47:25,368
He got one for himself.

2136
02:47:34,811 --> 02:47:38,884
Shekar, my nephew!

2137
02:47:41,351 --> 02:47:42,295
Our son-in-law!

2138
02:47:56,433 --> 02:47:58,572
He's right.
- No!

2139
02:47:58,735 --> 02:47:59,577
He's great!

2140
02:48:00,970 --> 02:48:02,813
What? What great?

2141
02:48:02,972 --> 02:48:05,578
Will he use my love
to convince my mother?

2142
02:48:05,909 --> 02:48:09,015
Let him use it,
how did you know his history?

2143
02:48:10,713 --> 02:48:14,058
There's internet on phone,
his name gives hundreds of pages.

2144
02:48:15,485 --> 02:48:17,590
Why did you kidnap me?

2145
02:48:18,154 --> 02:48:20,896
They didn't do it,
I engaged them to do it.

2146
02:48:27,263 --> 02:48:30,437
We don't want your jewels
or your money. Come.

2147
02:48:32,035 --> 02:48:35,039
Please give me yourwatch, brother.

2148
02:48:35,371 --> 02:48:37,612
Why?
- As your memorabilia, brother.

2149
02:48:37,774 --> 02:48:38,445
Is it?

2150
02:48:39,175 --> 02:48:40,176
As you wish.

2151
02:48:41,111 --> 02:48:41,782
Take it.

2152
02:48:43,513 --> 02:48:44,116
Bye, brother.

2153
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:46,055
Your bad time will vanish
and good time will arrive.

2154
02:48:50,753 --> 02:48:51,754
Where are you going?

2155
02:48:51,888 --> 02:48:55,097
I'll sell a mine and see their end.

2156
02:48:55,725 --> 02:49:02,734
Uganda President announced that private
diamond mines would be nationlised.

2157
02:49:05,168 --> 02:49:10,140
Rocking. . . my entire street
was rocking...

2158
02:49:12,108 --> 02:49:13,314
Is it an item song?

2159
02:49:14,844 --> 02:49:16,152
I thought it was a devotional song.

2160
02:49:17,614 --> 02:49:18,820
He'? You fake Swamyg

2161
02:49:20,016 --> 02:49:23,964
Though I'm a fake Swarny,
didn't I fulfill your 3 boons?

2162
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:24,791
Did 'you?

2163
02:49:24,954 --> 02:49:26,490
May I?
- Tell me.

2164
02:49:27,757 --> 02:49:29,498
Her marriage must get stopped.

2165
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:31,768
It got stopped, right;

2166
02:49:31,928 --> 02:49:32,906
Marriage was cancelled.

2167
02:49:35,131 --> 02:49:36,838
She'll marry a man
you can never imagine.

2168
02:49:37,333 --> 02:49:39,108
Did you imagine it would be?
No, right?

2169
02:49:40,003 --> 02:49:40,606
Now,

2170
02:49:41,971 --> 02:49:45,282
My currency, my arrogancy
must always be with me.

2171
02:49:45,441 --> 02:49:48,786
What you started with would
be with you only.

2172
02:49:50,947 --> 02:49:53,018
After losing your mines
and spending all your money,

2173
02:49:53,183 --> 02:49:54,321
you're left with Rs.2 lakhs.

2174
02:49:55,084 --> 02:49:56,825
How can you appoint
your grandson as CEO?

2175
02:49:56,986 --> 02:49:58,090
He's crazy.

2176
02:49:58,288 --> 02:50:00,734
It's not right to keep so many
people's future in his hands.

2177
02:50:00,890 --> 02:50:03,894
I own 60% of this company.

2178
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:05,867
How dare you suggest to me!

2179
02:50:05,995 --> 02:50:09,408
40% only sir,
Sunanda who owns 20% isn't here.

2180
02:50:09,566 --> 02:50:11,068
She'll never come.

2181
02:50:55,478 --> 02:50:57,185
What I'm saying <i>is...</i>

2182
02:51:05,188 --> 02:51:08,226
I propose Gautham as CEO!

2183
02:51:10,426 --> 02:51:11,871
Any objections?

2184
02:51:35,918 --> 02:51:37,591
Lost crores but left with coat.

2185
02:51:46,763 --> 02:51:52,975
A small spark on the edge ofdark...

2186
02:51:53,469 --> 02:51:59,977
A victory of dream coming <i>true...</i>

2187
02:52:00,143 --> 02:52:06,788
A sweet call on the edge of lip...

2188
02:52:06,949 --> 02:52:13,662
A turn for good in the
barrenness ofseparation...

2189
02:52:13,790 --> 02:52:17,101
Like a breaking dawn in the east...

2190
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:20,707
Happiness spread around like light...

2191
02:52:20,863 --> 02:52:27,337
Weather is spring forever to
make ﬂowers of happiness bloom...

2192
02:52:27,503 --> 02:52:33,852
Hearts have come together
to make life sweeter...

2193
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:37,072
