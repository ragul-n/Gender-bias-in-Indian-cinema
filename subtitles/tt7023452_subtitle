1
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,080
'HAIL CHIEF'

2
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,200
'Dinesh'

3
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,280
'Mahima Nambiar'

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
- Akkaru...
- Yes, brother?

5
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,960
Fly our Party's flag in half mast.

6
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,240
I'll fly it in half mast?

7
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,240
Yes, fool!

8
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
What are you looking at, huh?
Run!

9
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,640
"Bid him farewell with the music"

10
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
The Union Secretary of our
Tamil Culture Party...

11
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,800
The Socrates of Mullai Nagar!
Martyr Pichaiperumal...

12
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
passed away this morning.

13
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,440
His final procession is to take place
this evening at 5 PM.

14
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,720
Oh, how my heart aches!

15
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,440
How my eyes well up with tears!
How my throat is choked with grief!

16
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,840
I have to speak till my throat is dry
for the pittance they're paying me?

17
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,440
Give me that pesticide.

18
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,440
Halt!

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Get down.

20
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,360
Hello, brother.

21
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
What did you just say?

22
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,200
Martyr... Pichaiperumal?

23
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,200
No, before that.

24
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,960
True loyalist of Tamil Culture Party...?

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,160
My foot!

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,760
He was in our Indian People's Liberation
Party for twenty years!

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Think you can just rent a speaker set
and say whatever you want?

28
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,760
I'll knock the lice out of your head.

29
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,600
Now, get your facts right.

30
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,520
I.P.L.P.

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
T.C.P.

32
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,160
The beloved child of several
such parties...

33
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,160
Martyr Pichaiperumal has passed away.

34
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,400
O Cruel Lord of Death!
Give us back our brother.

35
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,600
Who stuck the Opposition's posters
on our wall?

36
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
I don't know, brother.

37
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,320
Tear them down.

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,160
I'll tear them down, brother?

39
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,040
Yes, fool!

40
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,240
Heard our Party's District Secretary is coming
We must make him crawl, okay?

41
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,000
Of course.
We're the kings of our town.

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,200
We've bought booze and biryani rice
for the men.

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,200
Looks like the Opposition is coming, too.
- Beat the daylights out of them.

44
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
This funeral belongs to our Party.

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,160
What is this, boss?

46
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,040
Only Selva's name is printed
in all our Party's posters.

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
He's not mentioned your name.

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,280
You're the District Secretary.

49
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,120
Mustn't he print his name
below yours?

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,960
He's dividing the Party
with internal politics.

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,560
He's going to ask the leader for a
nomination in the assembly elections.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,720
Like hell he will.

53
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,720
Slow down.

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
Get out of my way...
Hello, Chief!

55
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,640
Wear the shawl to him

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,000
We're the Youth Wing of Mullai Nagar.

57
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,480
Long live Parasuraman!
Hail Chief!

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,000
Start the car.

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,440
They spend 40 rupees on a shawl
and loot 500 from me. Leeches!

60
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,360
"He is in an eternal sleep"

61
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,600
Yes, tell me.

62
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,760
I have no one to fear...

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,840
"Arena is open
No rules to qualify"

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,680
My kids have been orphaned!

65
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,400
"Adorn our party flag over him"

66
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,760
So, Selvaraj...

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,960
I've greeted you even before
I could pay my respects to the dead man.

68
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,240
Are you well?

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,040
Heard you made a speech about
going to Delhi. Why?

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,360
You want to go sight-seeing
The Taj Mahal?

71
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,360
They brought me a recording
of your speech.

72
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,440
I could barely contain my laughter.

73
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,840
So you've bought the bar
at Mullai Nagar Main Road?

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,760
You can't keep a secret from me, kid.

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,920
You lay roads with crusher powder
instead of cement.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,920
You smuggle sand without permit.

77
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,720
You do know what would happen
if the Party Leader found out?

78
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,960
What?

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
You're threatening to tell the Leader?

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,520
I'll have Leader's missus
handle the Leader.

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,040
Get lost, man.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Men who sit with their legs crossed
have disappeared from politics.

83
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,920
Watch out.

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Beat it

85
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Beat it

86
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,160
What? You're already sloshed?

87
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,120
We're awesome, man.

88
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
Your girl is looking at you, Black-Out.

89
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,920
Our Party's posters have been ripped?

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,280
Keep letting them walk over us,
and we'll be destroyed in the elections.

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,120
Has Parasuraman left?

92
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
Let's go.

93
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,160
"Flags galore
Watch out for an encore"

94
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,400
My kids have been orphaned!

95
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,600
They're draping their Party's flag.

96
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,280
Out of the way!

97
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,520
You've brought some
girly shawl to the funeral?

98
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,200
Don't you dare insult our flag.

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,920
Starting a fight at a funeral?

100
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,600
You've come to a funeral.
Pay your respects and get going.

101
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,520
We'll rip you apart
if you drape that flag.

102
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,760
This funeral belongs to our Party.
We WILL drape our flag.

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
What do you care?
Mind your business, punk.

104
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,520
Pichai was in I.P.L.P. for 20 years!

105
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,720
These past two years, he's been in our Party
Isn't this our funeral?

106
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,320
Don't we all know
how you lured him into your Party?

107
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,160
You got married into his family
and stole their allegiance from us.

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
Aren't you ashamed?

109
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,400
This is uncalled for...
- What is the problem?

110
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Selva...

111
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,360
You're always causing trouble.
- Really?

112
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,200
This is not right political etiquette.
- Oh, yeah?

113
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
This is not nice.
- What's not nice?

114
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,960
Tell me, what's not nice?

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,400
You wave that tiny flag
and try to gather 300 votes here?

116
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,520
Selva!
Dare to touch my leader?

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,440
You touch me?

118
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,440
Selva, this is atrocious!
Just atrocious!

119
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't leave him
Beat him

120
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,720
Leave him

121
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,520
You sinner! Why are they fighting?

122
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,960
Grab him!
Don't let him go.

123
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,880
Start the car.

124
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,480
This is OUR area.
Take me along with you

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
T.C.P's men shall never
enter our area again.

126
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,800
Your Party was formed yesterday.
Think you can mess with us?

127
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,800
Hold the tempo.
It's going off.

128
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,200
Sync with me, sister.

129
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm nearly there, sir.

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,000
Enough rehearsals!
Let's go.

131
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,000
Come on, Murugan.
Make it quick.

132
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,720
Arrange the instruments properly.

133
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,600
Hop on...

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,080
Carry it inside.

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
Sundari, where is your bugle?

136
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,360
It's missing?
- Yes.

137
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
The bugle is missing?

138
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,880
Look for it.

139
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,040
Rama, look for it.

140
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,880
See if it's in the bag?

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,840
Where could it be?

142
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,160
Guess which song this is?

143
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,080
Holy Lord Murugan?
- Stupid moron.

144
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,680
It's 'Come closer, Silver Moon'.

145
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,040
Let's try another song.

146
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,560
Sundari!

147
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,720
How's it?

148
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,000
I've got goose bumps!
Keep playing.

149
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,840
I'll play you an Ilaiyaraja melody.
Sleep peacefully.

150
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,800
Let me pour it.

151
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,920
Stop with this round.
Don't ask for more.

152
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,600
Brother, we rocked that funeral!

153
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,240
The Opposition was terrified.

154
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,400
They'll never stick heir posters
in our town again.

155
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,480
Don't talk politics
where people come to drink.

156
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,680
You should be looking after your family,
not running behind this Party.

157
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,800
Why do you scold me?

158
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,080
You're from our Party.
You're a senior, an honourable man.

159
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,280
And you're talking this way?

160
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Aren't you proud that we
thrashed the Opposition men?

161
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Proud of what?

162
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,040
Either it's an upper caste
vs. lower caste fight...

163
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,640
or my Party vs. Opposition Party fight...

164
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,280
or you fight over this god
and that god.

165
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,840
All you need is a reason to fight.

166
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,240
Just shut up, drink and leave.

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,920
"My heart is leaping out of it's place;
Princess, it yearns to see your face."

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,320
"Like a puppy wagging it's tail;
It follows your trail."

169
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,280
"My heart is leaping out of it's place;
Princess, it yearns to see your face."

170
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,480
"Like a puppy wagging it's tail;
It follows your trail."

171
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,040
"My heart is leaping out of it's place"

172
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,440
Selva is splurging money
for the District posting.

173
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,040
So he'll get a posting for sure?

174
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,280
My wages, please.

175
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,640
Yes.

176
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,360
Quick, dad.

177
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,120
What's this?
You're paying wages to your son?

178
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,560
If he goes out to work,
he'll make 400 rupees.

179
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,920
I pay him 600.

180
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,760
This way, I get to keep him close.

181
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,920
Where are you going?

182
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,520
Some important work.
- I'll go with you.

183
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Let's go, buddy!

184
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,520
"My heart is leaping out of it's place;
Princess, it yearns to see your face."

185
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,760
"Like a puppy, wagging it's tail;
It follows your trail."

186
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,000
"My heart is leaping out of it's place!"

187
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,240
Black-Out, why are you tailing that auto?

188
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,160
When I give her this horn...

189
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,400
she'll be impressed with me
for finding what she lost.

190
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
And she'll fall back in love.
That's why.

191
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,800
But you get snubbed every time, man.

192
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,480
You know the story of the crow
and the pebbles?

193
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,400
The crow dropped pebbles
in the jar of water.

194
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,920
And the water rose eventually.

195
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
Then the crow drank the water!

196
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,080
One by one, I'll drop some pebbles.

197
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Sure, drop them.
But what if there's no water?

198
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,240
Shut your mouth!

199
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,680
"Big-eyed and flat-nosed, My Pretty!
Forever, you'll be my leading lady."

200
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,440
Oh, buddy...

201
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,280
You're so pretty!

202
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,880
Those clothes look great on you, man.

203
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,120
Looks like he won't let you go.

204
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,120
Your lips are so pink!

205
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,160
They got dark from all the smoking.
So I put on some lipstick.

206
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,120
I'm not coming with you.

207
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,760
Okay, then.

208
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,000
That class was like some Chinese movie...
Understood anything?

209
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,200
So annoying!

210
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,840
He's waiting for you.

211
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,720
"I've come with so much love;
Don't you walk away!"

212
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,080
Ignore him.

213
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,640
"I can't take it, I'd be crushed;
Don't you frown at me!"

214
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,840
"Girl, you are my future wife.
Come, light up my life."

215
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,080
"Listen, girl... I'm a nice guy.
Don't you hurt me!"

216
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,920
Why won't you just talk to him?
- Carry on, I'll join you.

217
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,240
You left it behind in the van.
I struggled to bring it back...

218
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,920
I know you took it. Now you're
returning it. Think I'll fall for you?

219
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,400
This following around,
sounding the dog horn, won't work with me.

220
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
I don't like it.

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,960
Why are you laughing?

222
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,120
Don't you think it's funny?

223
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,120
We were so madly in love...
- Love?

224
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Did I tell you that I loved you?

225
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,720
But I did. And you didn't say anything.
So you must love me, too.

226
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,040
I don't like you.

227
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,240
Why not?
- What did you studied?

228
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,520
You studied only I.T.I.

229
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,440
What about you? You just
walk around with that notebook.

230
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,080
You're just studying for
make-up exams.

231
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,480
Have you ever bathed?

232
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,960
You only wash your face.

233
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,720
You look above average,
but you talk too much.

234
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,640
And you put on
so much fairness cream.

235
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,800
Elephant ears!

236
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,240
Don't ever talk to me again.
Buzz off!

237
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,400
Sundari! I said stop, woman.

238
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,240
You've forgotten everything
I did for you?

239
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,880
You said wheeling was cool.
I did it for you and bruised my arm.

240
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,840
I got into a fight with the boys
in your hood.

241
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,080
But I still came for you the next day.

242
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,800
When you got chikungunya
I prayed to God that I should get it, too.

243
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,080
Whenever you played with your band,
I'd scream "Once more".

244
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,400
You keep giving missed calls.
I return every single one.

245
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,800
My phone was heated, my ears were heated,
but I continued to speak to you.

246
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,880
I wrote Lord Rama's name 108 times
for your 12th grade exams.

247
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,640
Don't try to smooth-talk me.

248
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,120
You need to be sincere in love.

249
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
You said you wouldn't drink.

250
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,040
But the other day...?

251
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,480
What did I do?
-You were drunk dancing at the funeral.

252
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,040
Sundari...

253
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,920
I swear on you...
- Lies, lies, lies!

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,360
I'm furious.

255
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
How could I ever trust you?

256
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,640
Forgive me this one time.
I'll get my act together...

257
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,160
It won't work out between us.

258
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,280
If you come behind me,
I really will call the cops.

259
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,320
What now?
Do you love me or not?

260
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,520
I don't.

261
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,880
"I've come with so much love;
Don't you walk away!"

262
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:48,280
"I can't take it, I'd be crushed;
Don't you frown at me!"

263
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Sir!

264
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,360
The bones on his arm are crushed.

265
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,320
They've amputated his arm, sir.

266
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't worry.
I will help you out.

267
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,960
Mani?

268
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,920
Mani...

269
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,440
The Party will protect you.

270
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,480
Is there nothing we can do
about Selva in Mullai Nagar?

271
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
We did all we could, brother.

272
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,200
People in that area
are real smart.

273
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,120
They drink with us all night
and go off with Selva in the morning.

274
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,920
They are under Selva's control.

275
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,360
You good-for-nothing!

276
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,880
You mean Selva knows
how to control them.

277
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,840
We must break that somehow.

278
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,800
Find a man who can match up to Selva.

279
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,240
Make room to plant our feet,
and we shall build a fort.

280
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,880
Give me some water.

281
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,120
When is the meeting?

282
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
10 o'clock.

283
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,280
Drive slow. If we reach on time,
they won't respect us.

284
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,480
Here, eat it

285
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,960
Won't you serve water
along with the meal?

286
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,400
What is your problem?

287
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,720
You don't go to work.

288
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,120
How do we raise the children?
How will we run the family?

289
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,000
I can't even go to the grocer.
We owe them so much money.

290
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,960
I've told you not to scold me
when I'm eating.

291
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,920
Serve me some gravy.

292
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,080
You only come home to eat.

293
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,480
You keep running behind Selva
all the time.

294
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,280
Have you made a single penny
from this wretched Party?

295
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,800
Say whatever you want about me.
Don't say a word about the Party.

296
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,920
Yeah, right.
That darned Party.

297
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,280
Like you're going anywhere with it.

298
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,840
Just eat and get lost, man.

299
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,640
I'm warning you.

300
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Who do you think I am?

301
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,840
Akkaru, let's go.

302
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,120
Coming, brother.

303
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,200
Get lost.

304
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,200
Money-grubbers!

305
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,600
Whenever I go home,
she yells at me, brother.

306
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,720
What would a housewife
know about politics?

307
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,280
She asks how we'll make ends meet
at this rate.

308
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,120
Come these elections,
I'll be the M.L.A.

309
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
After me, you'll be handling
the bar contracts.

310
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,960
Okay, brother.

311
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,000
Wake up.

312
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,160
Hello, brother!

313
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,760
Why does the egg gravy stink so bad?

314
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,200
It was cooked three days ago.

315
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,800
Naturally, it stinks.
- Who would come to such a bar?

316
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,800
None of the townsfolk come here.
Only the highway travellers come.

317
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,520
Why?

318
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,600
The townsfolk drink Murugesan's toddy.

319
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
We're always running at loss.
That's why the old owner let it go.

320
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,240
Why did you auction for it?

321
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,200
I know what I'm doing.
Shut your mouth.

322
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,800
Akkaru...
- Brother?

323
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,240
The walls need to be painted.

324
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,840
Hang a curtain here.

325
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,360
Get these windows fixed.

326
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,120
Okay!

327
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,320
And change these lights.

328
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,520
Okay, brother.

329
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,720
Wash the floors with bleaching powder.

330
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,760
Hang a picture of Namitha there.

331
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,480
And 'Silk' Smitha here.

332
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,200
I'll send the workers.
Stay close and supervise everything.

333
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,040
Oh, shall I?

334
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,520
Yes, fool!

335
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,240
Sleepy-head, the bar is mine
from Wednesday.

336
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,880
Okay, brother.
I'll start work in the morning.

337
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,360
I don't want to see your face around.

338
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,160
Brother...

339
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,240
I've drank toddy everywhere,
even Andhra border.

340
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,120
I swear, your toddy
has the most unique taste!

341
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,080
Sister, give me something spicy?

342
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,840
If I were a minister,
I'd get you government's approval.

343
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,320
Here, take this.

344
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,080
There's so much trouble in the Party.

345
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,600
And I've got money trouble, too.
- What?

346
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,040
Even you've got money trouble?
- Yes, brother.

347
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
Parasuraman just won't let me earn.

348
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,800
But I can't let my weakness show.

349
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,040
If I let it show,
he will just bury me.

350
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,360
I've bought the bar at the main road.
- I heard the boys talking about it.

351
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,600
I got the cops to seal
other shops in the vicinity.

352
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,960
Why?
- Government rules.

353
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,960
There must be no competitors
to affect the government bar's business.

354
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,440
How long will you toil
with all this, brother?

355
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,800
Why don't you work with me
at the bar?

356
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,080
But I run my business, Selva.
- Some business...

357
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,280
You need to bribe the cops every month.

358
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,000
You give away all your income
to them.

359
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,920
Just quit this business, brother.

360
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,840
Come and work with me.
Name your price.

361
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,400
But Selva...
this is the only job I know.

362
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,480
I can't leave this behind.

363
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,200
So you won't?

364
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,520
Okay, then.

365
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,200
I'll see you later.

366
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,560
Don't slant it
against the tree!

367
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,440
Plant it firm on the ground.

368
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,720
Hello, brother.

369
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,320
Hello!

370
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,400
Why is everyone
dressed so colourful?

371
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,600
It's Valentine's Day!

372
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,160
Each colour has a significance.
- What?

373
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,120
Blue colour means mutual love.

374
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,840
Green means waiting.

375
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,240
Orange means about to propose.

376
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
Hey...

377
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,880
To whom are you proposing?

378
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,040
Police constable Selvi.
She's my colleague.

379
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,960
Superb!

380
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,640
Looks like everyone is in love.

381
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,200
Yes, of course.

382
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,760
Except me.

383
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,800
Come here.

384
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,320
Why are you suddenly being nice?

385
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,000
The police are our friends.

386
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,800
Yes.

387
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,000
What's your shirt size?
- 38.

388
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,880
Why do you make him
follow you around like this?

389
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,280
I feel sorry for him!

390
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,360
It's hard to come by boys who follow
one girl with such dedication.

391
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,480
He must not be familiar
with Facebook and WhatsApp.

392
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,200
That's why he keeps coming behind you.

393
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,080
Had he followed me,
I'd have definitely said yes.

394
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,240
Oh, you don't know him.
He needs this treatment.

395
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
You get going.
I'll make him cry a little.

396
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,120
You monkey!
What do you want?

397
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,360
Instead of following me around,
why don't you get a job?

398
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,120
If someone saw, they'd judge me.

399
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,720
I'll tell on you to my parents.

400
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,800
My Uncle is a big-shot in Sevvapettai...

401
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Stop.
You talk too much.

402
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,560
Here, give this letter
to your friend Veni.

403
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,160
What's this?
- A love letter.

404
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,600
To her?
- Of course. You think I'm shameless?

405
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,840
How long can I keep following you?
Give it to her.

406
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,840
I won't.
Give it yourself.

407
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,000
Just give it to her.
She's prettier than you.

408
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,280
Where's my darling?

409
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,600
Hi, beautiful!

410
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,800
My heart is in that letter.

411
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,440
Happy Valentine's day.

412
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,600
What's in that paper?

413
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,720
It's nothing.

414
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Nothing?

415
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,720
He gave you another love letter?

416
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
No!
- Show me.

417
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,400
No.
- Let me read it.

418
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,360
It's blank.

419
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,720
It's blank?

420
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,720
You two are up to something.

421
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:45,200
'You're Sundari and I'm Sundaran;
When we get together, it's oh oh...!'

422
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,600
Hi!

423
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm coming.
- Come, baby.

424
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,680
Driver! Please pull over.

425
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,920
Where are you going?

426
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,400
Are you out of your mind?

427
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,480
You brainless oaf!

428
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,080
She didn't mean you, brother.
Sit.

429
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,960
Who do you think you are?
Think you're some big-shot?

430
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
What's this?
- It's my heart.

431
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,720
Now it's on the ground.
Watch what I do to your heart.

432
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,040
Oh God! Help me...

433
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,720
'You're Sundari and I'm Sekar...'

434
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,520
You clown.

435
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,440
Get lost.

436
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,320
Cows give milk;
Mosquitoes breed flu.

437
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,080
Don't allow dirty water puddles
to form around your house.

438
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,920
Protect yourself from fatal diseases!

439
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,480
"My dear, my honey!
O my dear, my honey!"

440
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,160
"Should I write these words of love?
Or sing to you, my flower, my dove?"

441
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
"Oh, Sundari!"

442
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:43,480
"Standing there before the deity,
When you throw a glance, I go crazy!"

443
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:53,360
"One on one, you'll take anyone down;
Your swag is sweeter than sugar."

444
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:03,680
"I brush my hair and powder my face;
The man in the mirror smiles back at me."

445
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,560
"My dear, my honey!
O my dear, my honey!"

446
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,240
"Should I write these words of love?
Or sing to you, my flower, my dove?"

447
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,880
"You made me show off a little,
You made me dance and twirl."

448
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,600
"Even as I carry out my chores,
My reckless heart soars."

449
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,720
"You're a superstar to me,
Like the ones in movies."

450
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,040
"I keep your photograph
in between these pages;"

451
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,760
"You're glued to my thoughts
through the ages."

452
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,800
"I'm alone with you,
don't care about the town"

453
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,640
"I love the way
you swear out loud."

454
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,440
"Boy, I love the way you swear out loud."

455
00:26:50,960 --> 00:27:00,280
"Shiny like candy, sharp as a blade;
I scribble our names together in the walls"

456
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,560
"Lying in the falling mist,
I listen to the radio at night."

457
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:15,160
"You're curd rice and I'm fish finger'
Walk with me, and I'm a power ranger."

458
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:26,240
"There's no one as pretty as you!
You're my girl, my Sundari."

459
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,920
"My dear, my honey!
O my dear, my honey!"

460
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,600
"Should I write these words of love?
Or sing to you, my flower, my dove?"

461
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:48,680
"The scent from your dhaavani,
Causes tremors inside my heart."

462
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:58,600
"The scent from your dhaavani,
Causes tremors inside my heart."

463
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,560
What are you doing?

464
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Nothing...
- You don't even know to kiss?

465
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,880
Of course, I can! I'm really good...
- You can't even kiss.

466
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,160
Come on, I'll show you.
- Get lost.

467
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,760
Wait, don't go!
- Don't even talk to me.

468
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,480
Watch Kamal Hassan movies and learn.

469
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,600
Oh, darn!

470
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,200
How did you get in?

471
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,840
My mother will be home any minute...
- No, she won't.

472
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
Please listen to me. Leave now!
- Don't panic...

473
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,880
What happened?
- My foot...

474
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
Oh, no. What happened?

475
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,160
A thorn pricked my foot.
It's filled with pus.

476
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
I know how to treat this.
Shall I?

477
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,240
What treatment?
- Shall I?

478
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,320
Okay.

479
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,960
Look into my eyes.

480
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,560
Close your eyes.

481
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,640
Close your eyes!

482
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,440
Take a deep breath in.

483
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,040
Breathe out.

484
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
The treatment is not over.
Don't stop halfway!

485
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Who is that?

486
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,320
I lost my way.
Is this Door Number 2?

487
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,160
Who are you?
- Don't, mother...

488
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,280
I came into the wrong house.

489
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,600
Show me your face!
- Please don't hit, mother.

490
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,080
Who is that man? Who is he?
- I don't know, mother.

491
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,960
Tell me!
- I don't know, mother.

492
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,640
Please look at me.
- I didn't come here to see your face.

493
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,480
Here's your phone.
Take it.

494
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,600
Why are you getting so worked up?

495
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,000
Didn't I tell you to leave?

496
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,720
I didn't know your mother
would be back so soon!

497
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,680
Do you know how badly
my mother hit me?

498
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,480
See!

499
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,560
Let me do my treatment.
- Hey, don't touch me.

500
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,360
Sundari, don't be mad...

501
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,560
Don't say a word.

502
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,160
You ran away.
- What was I supposed to do?

503
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,040
Your mother chased me with a broomstick!
Want me to stand and get beaten?

504
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,200
You don't need to do anything.
Leave me alone.

505
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,720
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,520
Sundari...

507
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
I even tucked my shirt in...

508
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,080
You're over-reacting.

509
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,320
We're going to be married anyway...
- Right!

510
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,600
Marriage is the last thing
we need.

511
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,520
Why?

512
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,160
What's wrong with
getting married?

513
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,320
You want me to marry you and serve toddy
like your mother does?

514
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,760
Didn't think about it
before you started seeing me?

515
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,960
I don't ever want to see your face.
Get lost.

516
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,360
Get lost!

517
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,320
Give me back my phone!

518
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,640
Here's your phone.
You keep it.

519
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,040
The display is broken.

520
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,120
Get the screen replaced.

521
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,000
Turn up the volume.

522
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,320
Dude, you said you won't drink anymore.

523
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,760
You even swore on your girl.
What's up?

524
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,760
I was so furious,
I wanted to punch her face!

525
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,960
Lucky for her,
she got away.

526
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,920
What did happen?
Tell us.

527
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,120
I went to her place to see her.

528
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
She was home alone,
so I went in.

529
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
She was lying in the cot.

530
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,440
Oh, what next?

531
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,960
I'm heartbroken here.
And you're looking for a dirty story?

532
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,400
Sorry, buddy.
- I'll kill you.

533
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
She's not right for my family.

534
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,760
What a filthy mouth!

535
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,840
If we were to get married
and have a few kids...

536
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,240
and she insults me
in front of my children!

537
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,840
Who would respect me then?

538
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh, that story will
be carried to your grandchildren!

539
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,920
Hello!

540
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,920
Come here!

541
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,120
What?

542
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,440
You don't kill your crabs
before cooking them?

543
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,240
Why?

544
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,320
A crab bit my mouth
while I was eating.

545
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,120
Get lost.

546
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,160
Can't you hear me talking?

547
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
What's going on here?

548
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,920
I'm the only person drinking here
since morning. Terrible service...

549
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,240
Make me two half-boiled eggs.
Lots of pepper.

550
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,960
How much chickpeas did you cook?
- Ten kilograms.

551
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,200
How much did you sell?

552
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,640
Got the bills for chicken?
- We still haven't paid, brother.

553
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,280
Why not?
- We didn't sell anything.

554
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,760
I had to throw it all away.

555
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,520
How will I be able to give you
money for this everyday?

556
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,840
How much do you have in the cash-box?

557
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,080
1,000 and some change.

558
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,240
How much do we owe the grocer?

559
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,680
Over 2,000.

560
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,000
What the hell
am I running this bar for?

561
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Hello...

562
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,960
A crab from your restaurant
bit my mouth.

563
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,520
Are you listening?

564
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,240
What happened?

565
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,200
A crab bit me.

566
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,640
Hello, sir. This is Selva,
Union Secretary of I.P.L.P.

567
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,880
There's a man called Murugesan
selling toddy in our town.

568
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,800
You know that's illegal.

569
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,080
What would happen when
your superiors hear about this?

570
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,840
You must take action.

571
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,320
Hello.
- Sekar!

572
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,280
Where are you?
- I'm out, mom. Don't wait up.

573
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,160
The cops have taken your father!

574
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,640
I'm really scared.

575
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,280
I'll go immediately.
Don't worry!

576
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,200
Come.

577
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,680
Sir, what happened?

578
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,640
You, wait outside.
Wash the jeep.

579
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,920
What happened, Uncle?

580
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,240
One ginger tea.

581
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,640
Take off your shirt.

582
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,280
Sir, what did I do?

583
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,640
Take off your shirt.

584
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,000
You know this is our
ancestral trade...

585
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I said, take off your shirt!

586
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,000
Hit him!

587
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,680
Where is he?
- They just took him upstairs.

588
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Why are you hitting him?
Let my father go!

589
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,640
Who are you?

590
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,000
Constable, throw him out.

591
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,720
I'm his son.
Why are you hitting him?

592
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,360
We told you not to sell toddy.

593
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,360
We can lock you up for a year
under Goondas Act.

594
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,160
We deposit money in your account
every month.

595
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,480
When did you pay me? Rubbish!
I'm a cop! Throw him out.

596
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,920
Don't touch my father!

597
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,960
Ask your son to go to the Court!

598
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,080
Hit him harder.

599
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,880
Buddy, calm down.

600
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,440
Listen to me!
- What?

601
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,920
I enquired. Selva has filed a complaint.
You take it up with the Party.

602
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,000
Go on.

603
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,920
So, this Selva filed a complaint?

604
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,000
That guy is trouble.

605
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,760
Please help me out, Chief.
- I understand your problem, son.

606
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,160
But he's from our Party.
It won't be right if I intervene.

607
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,160
Please, Chief...

608
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,680
Harshad wants to talk to you.
- Oh?

609
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
Hello, grandpa!
- Hi, baby.

610
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,440
Have you eaten?

611
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
Yes.
- Where is your daddy?

612
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,280
You're crying?

613
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,280
Narayanan, call up the police station.

614
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,640
Have you got any money?

615
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,400
How much do you want?

616
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Not for me.

617
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,880
It's for the cops.

618
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,480
Pay them off,
take him home.

619
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,520
Walk faster, dad.

620
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,760
You carry on. I'll come.

621
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,720
I said, walk faster!

622
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,120
I would if I could!

623
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,200
I'm not able to...

624
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,560
This guy Selva...?

625
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,400
He was just a rookie under me.

626
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,360
Long ago, they offered me
a position in the Party.

627
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,280
I had my hands full with our business,
so I gave it up for him.

628
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,880
Now he's in a good place.

629
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,880
And he's hurting the hand
that fed him.

630
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,800
It makes me so angry...

631
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,520
I've got no recognition, Sekar.

632
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,560
Dad!

633
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,320
It's all my fault.

634
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,000
Your mother always said...

635
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,200
'Forget this business,
policemen are dangerous.'

636
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,800
And today I got beaten up
in front of my son.

637
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,840
I feel like I should just quit.

638
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,240
What's wrong with you?
Just keep quiet, dad.

639
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,840
Sekar's dad! Are you okay?

640
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
Break all those pots.

641
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,160
Election Commission has announced
that elections will be held shortly...

642
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,400
What?

643
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,640
I need to see the Chief.

644
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,280
Come

645
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,640
Six police and two officers...
to prevent bribing voters.

646
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,600
Hello, Chief.

647
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,680
Come in, Murugesan's son.

648
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,840
What's your problem now?
- There's no problem.

649
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,080
Chief!

650
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
Get my dad a posting
in our Party.

651
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,360
What posting?
- Anything...

652
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,360
Take it.

653
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,120
Anything- District, Union...

654
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,560
I want my father to be like
Selva in this town, Chief.

655
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,640
You fool!

656
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,840
Lord Murugan...

657
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,680
You think politics is a game?

658
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,000
It's not like an engineering college
admission, to just be given away.

659
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,720
When we start campaigning in the morning,
we go on till the next evening.

660
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,080
Must keep on smiling, with folded hands,
like praying to God.

661
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,920
Not one person will greet us back.

662
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,840
My shoulders are sore
from constantly greeting!

663
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,000
My jaw-bones hurt
from smiling non-stop!

664
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,920
You need to act.

665
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,960
Dedicate yourself to the Party.

666
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,680
I will dedicate.
Totally.

667
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,680
Dedicate what?

668
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,840
You fool!

669
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,680
You need to spend money
to impress people on top!

670
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,320
You can't do this.

671
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,800
No...I will.

672
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,960
Everyone in the district
knows Selva.

673
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Does anyone outside this town
even know your father?

674
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,280
It won't work out.

675
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,160
Get going now.
Go!

676
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,000
Sekar!

677
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,280
Son...

678
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,960
Our Leader is driving past Mullai Nagar
on the 20th of this month.

679
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,120
Normally, Selva puts up banners
for him.

680
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,880
Will you do it this time?

681
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,480
I will, brother!

682
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,480
Not one or two banners...

683
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,720
You'll have to erect them
all along the way. Can you?

684
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,640
I can, Chief.

685
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,120
Let the Leader's photograph
be of large size.

686
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,240
My photo can be medium sized.
- Done!

687
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,880
Let your father's photo be small.
And write 'Organised by: Murugesan'.

688
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,600
It must make the Leader wonder,
'Who is this Murugesan?'

689
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,120
Will you make him wonder?

690
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,960
I will!

691
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,840
Give him our photo CDs.

692
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,760
Okay!

693
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,680
"O Leader with Vision'
'An Eternal Light"

694
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,040
"O Solid Root of the People!"

695
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,640
Use such captions.

696
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,400
Take down his number.
Call him if you have any doubts.

697
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,680
Got it?

698
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,720
Selva is a dangerous man.

699
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,720
Are you up for it?

700
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,440
I will manage, brother.

701
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,240
Will my father get
a posting for sure?

702
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,600
Let me handle that, son.

703
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,800
No way! No way...

704
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,680
I won't agree to this.

705
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,960
What do I need a posting for?

706
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,640
Politics is not anybody's game.

707
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
You need to be a crook.

708
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,120
You need to beg random men.

709
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,280
And lie shamelessly.

710
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,240
I can't do all that.

711
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,760
Politicians make you rise to the top...
and then drop you!

712
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,920
My son is never wrong.

713
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,400
You should listen to him.

714
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,360
If you become the councilor, I'll get
extra kerosene from the subsidy store!

715
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,800
You free-loader!
Are you out of your mind?

716
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,560
If he asks for the keys
to the trunk, tell him it's lost.

717
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,440
He asked me this morning
and I gave it to him.

718
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,680
It's over.

719
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,040
Hello, brother!

720
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,800
Hello, Sekar.
- I've got the documents.

721
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,760
How much will it fetch me?

722
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,680
Are the documents in order?
- Yes, brother.

723
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,400
Your father didn't come?

724
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,920
He's busy with something.

725
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,680
Give him the small bundle.

726
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,680
Get up.
You're sitting on the Goddess of Wealth.

727
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,440
There's 100 thousand in it.
Count it.

728
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,320
What are you going to do
with this money?

729
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,840
I'm erecting banners.

730
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,840
Give him the bigger bundle.

731
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,080
Bigger bundle?

732
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,040
What will you do
when your father gets a posting?

733
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,960
We'll bid for the sand contract,
start a brick factory...

734
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,480
make bricks and build a house,
park our car in the house.

735
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,600
What if it flops?

736
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,720
What?

737
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,680
Eat your bananas.

738
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,800
I worked hard to buy that plot.

739
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,880
Why would you pledge it
to get a posting?

740
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,200
You weren't able to do a thing
when the cops hit you.

741
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,720
You want me to do nothing?

742
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,560
If you'd had a posting in the Party,
he wouldn't have touched you.

743
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,200
You spoke so passionately yesterday.
What's happened now?

744
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,840
But I was in pain yesterday.

745
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Look. You just stand by
and flash your teeth for the pictures.

746
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,360
I'll take care of everything else.

747
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,160
Fold your hands!

748
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Smile, dad.

749
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,840
Smile bigger, dad.

750
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,720
Give us a big smile, dad!

751
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,240
He was right here...

752
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,600
Where is he?

753
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,120
Hand me the knife.

754
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,640
There he is!
Reading a book inside the thicket.

755
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,760
"You've a long way to go
Socrates and Karl Marx of the present"

756
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,640
"Generous than King Karna
You're world popular"

757
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,560
"You're wiser than Thirukkural
Our votes are only for you"

758
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,400
"You're the gem among the crowd
Praises shower from everywhere"

759
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,120
"Deemed son of all the mothers
We revere you like God"

760
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,000
"Come on.."

761
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,880
Make a double-knot.

762
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,000
Hello, Chief.

763
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,040
Sekar doing alright?
- Yes, Chief.

764
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,360
Get back to work.

765
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,680
"The Guiding Light..."

766
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,880
Not bad.
Our Party has thinkers.

767
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,120
But thinkers never succeed
in our Party!

768
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,080
You're a thinker, too.

769
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,880
Not me!

770
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,880
We've run out of money, Black-Out.
Let's not spend any more.

771
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,560
Remember what the Chief said?
The statue unveiling has to be grand!

772
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,680
Ask Pattabi to start
screaming in his speaker.

773
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
At 4:00 P.M. tomorrow, the statue unveiling
ceremony will be presided over...

774
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,480
by the noble leader,
Mr. Duraiswamy of I.P.L.P.

775
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,800
Come one, come all
to give him a warm welcome.

776
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,440
"O fearless philanthropist
Hail the ambitious leader"

777
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,280
"O the peak of wisdom and love
Hail the future chief minister"

778
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,960
"Shed the fatigue, toil hard
One glance of his is enough"

779
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,760
"Our charisma will be omnipresent
even after we vanish"

780
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,200
"Hail the Socrates of our neighbourhood.."

781
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:01,360
"O Saviour of the poor
A man to rewrite the history"

782
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,400
Park over there...

783
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,760
Get the people down
and move the vehicles.

784
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,920
The leader will be taking this road.

785
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,760
Refreshments ready?
- Yeah, man.

786
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,040
"Last man standing in the honest clan"

787
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,560
Buddy, the whole town is stunned.

788
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,680
You're killing it, man.

789
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,960
Don't I always?

790
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,800
Your father hasn't come?

791
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,800
He said he'll come.
He's not here though.

792
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,880
When the Leader gets here,
I want you to get down and cheer.

793
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,400
Long live our Leader!

794
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,200
Long live the loyalist, Murugesan!

795
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,560
Long live the loyalist, Murugesan!

796
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,400
Long live the Proud Lion Parasuraman!

797
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,520
Long live the loyalist, Murugesan!

798
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,800
Superb, sister.

799
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,920
Parasuraman! Murugesan!

800
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,160
Parasuraman!
Murugesan!

801
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,320
Louder! Yay!

802
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,920
Give everyone two packets
of rose milk.

803
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,040
The leader will be here shortly.
You're doing great, sisters.

804
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,840
Take this flag.
Good luck!

805
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,960
Bhai from Arakkonam
has come to make biryani.

806
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,800
Ask Anaconda to stay close
and manage it.

807
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,000
Sekar, you're getting a posting
for your father in the Party?

808
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,080
You're a big guy!

809
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,760
Father needs to be respected, right?

810
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,080
That's correct.

811
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,840
Buddy.

812
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,400
The townsfolk have been
waiting for a while.

813
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,120
Check when the Leader will come?

814
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,320
Tell me, Sekar.

815
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,000
Everything is set here.
Has he started?

816
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,960
Yes, he's started.
We'll be there in half an hour.

817
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,000
We're already in the car.

818
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,840
Lay out the fireworks!
The Chief is on his way.

819
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,000
Hello!
- Greetings, sir.

820
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,840
Yes, it's me.
- Tell me, sir.

821
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,200
I'm calling about the Mullai Nagar
statue unveiling ceremony.

822
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,920
I'd informed the Leader.
- Yes!

823
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,120
Is he on his way?

824
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,000
Black-Out, the people are leaving.

825
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,120
Stop.

826
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,080
Don't leave!
Where are you going?

827
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,080
Sister! Wait up...

828
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,360
It's getting late, Sekar.
My kids are alone at home.

829
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,040
He'll be here in ten minutes.

830
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,680
Wait up, brother.

831
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,480
The Leader will be here in ten minutes.
Please be patient.

832
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,080
Do this for me.
He'll be here.

833
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,440
Please, he's on his way!

834
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,840
Leader, about the inauguration...
- Parasuraman!

835
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,760
I'm on my way to the temple
on a pilgrimage.

836
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,840
No, sir. The people...

837
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,640
You gathered the people to make a
show out of it?

838
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,240
How will I come now?

839
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,600
That's true.
But it's on your way...?

840
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,440
If I take a 6KM detour
to see these people...

841
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,560
when will I see the Lord?

842
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,320
Isn't the Lord more important
than the people?

843
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,200
Okay, sir.

844
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,360
Maybe on your way back?

845
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,200
Enough of your crooked shows.

846
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,560
Send the people away and
meet me in my office later.

847
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,800
Okay, sir.

848
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,680
Sekar...

849
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,440
The Leader has taken
the by-pass route...

850
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,360
What? The whole
town is waiting here!

851
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,000
That's not a problem.
- What do you mean...?

852
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,680
Just send the people away.

853
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,960
Chief asked you to come home tonight.
- But...

854
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,200
Come here, we'll talk it out.

855
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,320
Sekar, when is the Leader coming?

856
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,600
There's plenty for everyone.

857
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,640
Stand in line!

858
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,000
Stop fighting.

859
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,920
Where are you?

860
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,600
He's over there.
Pull over.

861
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,040
Yes, brother?

862
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,640
What's this?
- Our Party's banner.

863
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,680
Knuckle-head!

864
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,360
Murugesan erected a banner
when I was away...

865
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,040
And it doesn't even carry my name!

866
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,920
What the hell were you doing?

867
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,440
It wasn't Murugesan.
His son Sekar did it.

868
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,960
Tear down all the banners.

869
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,800
I'll straighten him out tonight.

870
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,000
All our efforts went to waste...

871
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,760
Let it go, man.

872
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,600
Dude, let's drink.

873
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,440
You really want to drink tonight?
- Get a half from the Black Market.

874
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,480
Akkaru, check if he's home.

875
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,000
He's not home.
The house is locked.

876
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,120
He can't get away.
We'll find him.

877
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,280
Two of you look over there.

878
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,640
Check if he's out there.

879
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,160
You, go that way.

880
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,760
See if he's in the farm.

881
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,920
We looked everywhere.
He's not here.

882
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,800
Where could he be?
Break everything!

883
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,320
Burn this place down!

884
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,160
I'll burn it down, shall I?

885
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,640
Burn it down, you moron.

886
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,280
It was Selva who prevented the Leader
from coming here today.

887
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,680
Selva won't let you live hereafter, son.

888
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,560
You can't survive in this town
when he's against you.

889
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,240
Go make a living elsewhere.

890
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,280
As long as he lives,
he won't let you be.

891
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,160
This is where his mistress lives.

892
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,400
That's his motorcycle.

893
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,400
Go a little further down.

894
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,320
Don't hurt yourself!

895
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,240
He will go past this way
to his primary house.

896
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,440
We'll kill him.

897
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,880
I'm scared, man.

898
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,920
Get yourself drunk.
Then you'll feel no fear.

899
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,560
Is he coming?

900
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,000
He's come?

901
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,520
Is he coming?

902
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,360
No?

903
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,520
Stop staring at me!

904
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,920
Beat him up.

905
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,480
I'll rip him to pieces!

906
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,400
Black-Out, you will kill him?

907
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,400
I'm Selva!

908
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,000
Slaughter me!

909
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,560
Slay! Slay! Slay!

910
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,760
I can't do it, man.

911
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,680
You can be anything when you're
sober, Black-Out.

912
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,080
But when you're drunk,
you must think sober...

913
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,560
I'll just lie down.
Wake me up when he's here?

914
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,240
Don't forget to wake me up.

915
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,320
We need to kill him.

916
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,760
Wake up.

917
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,200
Anaconda...

918
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,760
Goodbye.

919
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,360
Anaconda...

920
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,800
He's coming! He's here.

921
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,480
He's here.

922
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,760
Oh, buddy...he's here.

923
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,960
I always pass out in a corner.
But he's in the middle of the road...

924
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,720
What is it...?

925
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,840
Come here!

926
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,440
Black-Out...

927
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,360
What's happened?

928
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,760
Black-Out...
You actually killed him?

929
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,480
I didn't.
How could I?

930
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,480
No way...

931
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,400
Selva...

932
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,080
Run, run, run, run!

933
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,840
Run, run, run, run!

934
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,960
Don't go that way! Turn around.
- Let that guy go.

935
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,440
Don't let him see you face!

936
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,600
Don't look back.
Run!

937
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,160
Sekar!

938
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,880
Sekar has slayed Selva.
He's running away!

939
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,560
'Intermission'

940
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,000
Hello?

941
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,520
When did it happen?

942
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,680
Okay, I'll tell him.

943
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,760
Boss...
- Yeah?

944
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,280
Sekar has murdered Selva.

945
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,680
The body is at Government Hospital
for post-mortem.

946
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,080
That's good news, indeed.

947
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,160
Your tea.

948
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,520
Add some sugar!

949
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,200
But the doctor forbade you...

950
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,800
I'll pop some sugar pills.

951
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,200
Your horoscope said,
'Your dreams shall come true today.'

952
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,680
Order a nice, big wreath.
- Okay, boss!

953
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,280
Ours shall be the first wreath
over his corpse.

954
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,120
I went to Erikkarai to turn on the motor...

955
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,880
He had already slashed Selva
and was running away.

956
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,560
Selva was lying in agony,
in a pool of blood.

957
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,560
I called the ambulance
and got him admitted.

958
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,560
Who slashed him?
- Murugesan's son, Sekar.

959
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,200
Was it really Sekar who did it?
- I swear, it was Sekar!

960
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,240
I saw it, sir.

961
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,200
Sir, stop!
When will you arrest the attacker?

962
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,800
The investigation is underway.
- You know Sekar is the murderer.

963
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,720
If you don't catch him,
I'll kill the guy.

964
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,000
Flashing a knife before the police?
Take him in.

965
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,160
You're threatening us, not the criminal?
You better catch him.

966
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,320
I'll lock you all up!

967
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,040
Don't cause trouble.
- Let's go!

968
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,720
Chief, they've slaughtered Selva!

969
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,160
Where's his body?

970
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,040
He's still alive.
The doctor said he's unconscious.

971
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,520
I only passed on the information!

972
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,760
O Lord Murugan!

973
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,880
You have saved my Selva.

974
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,680
Give me those sugar pills.

975
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,640
Doctor, how is he doing?

976
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,080
Judging by the injury,
he's been attacked with a sharp object.

977
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,400
It's too soon to say anything.
He might even slip into a coma.

978
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,680
Greetings, sir.

979
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,720
Who did this?
- They say it was Sekar.

980
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,600
Sekar?

981
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,040
He's the boy who erected those banners
at Mullai Nagar two days ago.

982
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,800
He's from your Party.
- Oh!

983
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,000
That guy...

984
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,360
I told them a million times not to
quarrel and damage the Party's image.

985
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,320
Nobody listens.

986
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,600
You do your duty.
- Yes, sir.

987
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,440
I'll make sure the Party doesn't interfere.
- Thank you, sir.

988
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,880
Let me know if you need some help.
- Okay, sir.

989
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,280
Last night, Sekar and Murthy were
drinking here for a long time.

990
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,000
They were cursing out loud
about murdering Selva.

991
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,080
Know anything else?

992
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,840
No, sir.
Can we leave?

993
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,960
Sir?
- Anything in the crime scene?

994
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,800
There are booze bottles everywhere.

995
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,600
And there's a long blade.

996
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,080
Anything on Sekar?

997
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,760
No, sir. I did enquire...
the guy has absconded.

998
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,520
Did you pick up his friends?

999
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,520
I wanted to ask you first.

1000
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,160
You're going sit on your behinds
till they abscond, too?

1001
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,640
Grab every one of his friends
within an hour.

1002
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,360
Or I'll slap a memo against you.

1003
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,080
Sir?
- Subbarao? Where are you?

1004
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,800
Sir, I'm investigating Selva's case.

1005
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,200
Very good.
What's the status?

1006
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,720
Sir, we suspect a man called Sekar.
- Is he a suspect or are you sure?

1007
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,720
I'm positive, sir!
We have an eye-witness.

1008
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,720
It's confirmed.
- Good. What's the motive?

1009
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,400
Sir, there was some hostility
because of Party's internal politics.

1010
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,760
There was an issue as
Selva's name wasn't in banners.

1011
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,480
Sekar's father sells toddy...
- When will you catch him?

1012
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,760
The guy has absconded.
We'll round him up in 4 - 5 days.

1013
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,720
Very good.

1014
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,560
Ask for the armed forces
from the battalion.

1015
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,480
Okay, sir.

1016
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,440
Carry 5 SLR rifles.

1017
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,760
That'll be helpful, sir.

1018
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,800
Want a cannon?

1019
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,560
Sir?

1020
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,000
With so much unrest in town,
and the pressure I'm facing...

1021
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,680
you're talking rubbish
instead of catching the guy?

1022
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,400
If you don't get him by evening,
I'll strip off your uniform.

1023
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,640
Hang up, now.

1024
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,480
What did the DSP say?

1025
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,320
He asked you to shut up
and leave the file here.

1026
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,920
Okay, sir

1027
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,600
Buddy, you're a lion-heart!

1028
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,760
Why do you say that?
- Of course!

1029
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,840
You just finished Selva overnight!

1030
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,760
Don't say that!
I didn't kill him.

1031
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,600
God knows who killed him?

1032
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,680
Should we go back
into the town or not?

1033
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,040
Don't over-think it!

1034
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,880
Let's get booze for 100 bucks, get drunk,
and weep at the funeral. Okay?

1035
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,760
Let's go?
- I don't hear the funeral beats...

1036
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,320
The town is really...

1037
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,520
You dare to attack Selva?
Kill him!

1038
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,520
Get him!

1039
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
Get up, get up, GET UP!

1040
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,320
Run!
- Don't let him get away.

1041
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,000
Come on, run.

1042
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,840
Get away somehow, Black-Out.

1043
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,040
Catch Sekar. Get him!

1044
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,400
Don't stop, get him!

1045
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,600
My leg is caught in the thorn bush.

1046
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,960
Tell me, Sekar!

1047
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,880
Selva's men are after me.
I need to talk to the Chief.

1048
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,800
It's important.
- Boss has gone to Delhi!

1049
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,280
He'll be back after a week.

1050
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,800
A week, or maybe ten days.
I'll call you when he's back.

1051
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,560
They've cornered me.
I must speak to him.

1052
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,520
I'll inform him.

1053
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,640
They'll kill me, brother!
- I'll call you, Sekar.

1054
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,800
In the attack of I.P.L.P
Union Secretary Selva...

1055
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,560
Sekar, a.k.a 'Black-Out' Sekar
is being hunted by the police...

1056
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,160
They've reported it
as though I killed him!

1057
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,400
You will never drink again!
Never, ever!

1058
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,360
Black-Out...you did kill him, right?
- You fool!

1059
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,240
I didn't! He's got enemies everywhere.
Could've been anyone.

1060
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,200
Black-Out!

1061
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,960
Hopeless.

1062
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,960
It's got the leg piece?

1063
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,280
More booze!

1064
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,840
We don't have any money left.

1065
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,360
Money...

1066
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,920
Get another quarter...
- With this, we can't!

1067
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,600
Call up Vijay.
He's loaded.

1068
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,080
Hello, Vijay!

1069
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:45,880
Tell me, dude.

1070
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,200
What's your position like?
- It's a real mess, buddy.

1071
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,240
Where are you?

1072
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,040
Anaconda and I are in
Pandi Lodge, Thiruttani.

1073
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,040
We have no money on us.
Get some money and come here.

1074
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,640
Don't tell anyone.
Get here nice and quiet.

1075
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,040
Especially, don't let the idiotic policemen
catch you leaving.

1076
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,760
Don't talk about cops like that, buddy.

1077
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,640
They're lovely people.

1078
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,680
You stay there.
I'm coming.

1079
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,320
Good job.

1080
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,400
Bless the Lord Muruga,
residing in Thiruttani Hills!

1081
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,240
Buddy!

1082
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,280
Sekar, wake up.
The guys are here.

1083
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,480
You are living happily

1084
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,080
I want more booze and biryani...

1085
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,400
Fool. Hands down.

1086
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,600
Where did you buy this?
It's not cooked properly.

1087
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,040
What happened?

1088
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,720
He's been saying
the same thing since morning.

1089
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,760
He says he went to kill Selva,
but got sloshed and blacked-out.

1090
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,000
Then he woke up and found
someone else had slashed Selva.

1091
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,960
He's stressing me out, sir.

1092
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,640
This won't work. I'll deal with it.
Go, now.

1093
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,680
You sold us out!

1094
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,160
Call yourself our friend?
- Buddy...

1095
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,920
The cops were with us
when you called.

1096
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,480
Zip it. You're with them too!

1097
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,080
You called and fell into the trap.

1098
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,200
Shut up! Shut up!

1099
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,440
Guna!

1100
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,680
You thrash them so hard,
they must confess up loud and clear.

1101
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,600
Sir...

1102
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:21,680
Oh!

1103
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,040
Fellow townsfolk, eh?
You're all partners in crime?

1104
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,840
Constable!
Go!

1105
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,400
But sir...

1106
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,000
Vijayamuthu!
You're the right man for this job.

1107
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,880
Sir, I am a family man.

1108
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,040
That guy got Selva...!

1109
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,240
Every one of you is afraid?

1110
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,760
Are you cops or what?
You should be ashamed.

1111
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,360
Oiled the lathi?
- Yes.

1112
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,240
Give it to me.

1113
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,680
I will...

1114
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,360
Sekar?

1115
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,280
Sekar?

1116
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,680
Do tell me what happened, son.

1117
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,160
Sir, I was furious.

1118
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,480
But I got sloshed and blacked-out.

1119
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,800
I woke up to pee,
but someone had slashed him.

1120
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,760
Anyone in your position
would hesitate to admit it.

1121
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,000
He destroyed your farm...
All because you erected a banner.

1122
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,280
Had you come to the police first...

1123
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,480
I'd have brought him in
and bashed him up.

1124
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,000
Anyway, let it go.
Past is past.

1125
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,440
What really happened?

1126
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,120
I was furious...

1127
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,760
but I was also scared.

1128
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,840
I got drunk
because it gives me courage.

1129
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,760
But I blacked-out.

1130
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,720
When I woke up,
he'd been slashed.

1131
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,880
Understand my position, Sekar.

1132
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,160
I've suffered two heart-attacks.

1133
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,880
I'm going to retire in six months.

1134
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,400
What will I do at this age
if they transfer me to some crap-hole?

1135
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,480
Correct, sir.

1136
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,160
I'm under a lot of pressure.

1137
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,000
I need to close the case.

1138
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,840
Don't be afraid.
I'm here for you.

1139
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,920
You can confide in me.

1140
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,280
I was furious...

1141
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,400
I was scared...got drunk
to gain courage.

1142
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,480
I...

1143
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,040
blacked-out...
Got up to pee.

1144
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,120
Went to pee. He was lying there.
- I can't do this.

1145
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,760
Order me one soda.

1146
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,480
What's happening inside, Head Constable?

1147
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,080
You're throwing him a feast?

1148
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,040
He says he didn't attack Selva.

1149
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,960
We can't even file an F.I.R.

1150
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,400
Then let him out.
We'll take care of him.

1151
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,680
Okay, wait.

1152
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,480
I'll ask the Inspector.

1153
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,880
We'll wait here till he comes out.

1154
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,920
We'll kill him when he
gets out!

1155
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,920
Do whatever you want outside the station.
Don't trouble us.

1156
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,200
Vadivelu, we can't let him
get away this time.

1157
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,320
Gather all our men.

1158
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,080
Buddy, wake up.

1159
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,680
Selva's men are waiting outside.

1160
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,600
They plan to kill you
once you're out.

1161
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,960
The inspector is on their side.
- What do I do?

1162
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,880
You'll do as I say?
- Yeah!

1163
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,680
Just tell them you attacked Selva.

1164
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,240
Hey, I didn't do it.

1165
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,600
Why should I admit to it?

1166
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,600
When he wakes up at the hospital,
the truth will be out.

1167
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,800
It's safer for you to stay inside.

1168
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,960
Boss...they've arrested Sekar.

1169
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,360
They say he'll be in
remand prison for fifteen days.

1170
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,520
Poor thing.

1171
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,960
Open your mouth.

1172
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,560
Wider.

1173
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,400
Take off your pants.

1174
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,320
Squat.

1175
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,960
Squat!

1176
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
Stashed some weed somewhere?

1177
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,840
Send him away.

1178
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,800
Pick up your shirt.

1179
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,320
Go.
Join the assembly.

1180
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,120
Get up.

1181
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,480
How is Sekar?
Know something?

1182
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,040
I'm trying to find out.

1183
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,320
It's hard to get bail.

1184
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,320
We're applying for bail this week.

1185
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,240
Carry these pots.
- I'm coming, mom.

1186
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,360
All of you are the reason
he's in prison now.

1187
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,000
If you'd been true friends,
you wouldn't have let him do this.

1188
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,520
Now it's not your problem.

1189
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,600
Come in, sir.

1190
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,200
He's the one who attacked
'Iron-fist' Selva.

1191
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,760
Where do you live
in Thiruvallur?

1192
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:13,720
Mullai Nagar.

1193
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,920
How did you kill Selva?

1194
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,800
He and I had this small issue.

1195
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,840
When he was riding his motorcycle,
I smashed his head with a rod.

1196
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,520
You did him solo?

1197
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,880
He's a big-shot, alright.

1198
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,880
Enough games.
Get going, people.

1199
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,520
Sit over here, my dear.

1200
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,200
So, you attacked Selva?

1201
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,440
No...

1202
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,640
I was furious...
but I got sloshed and blacked-out.

1203
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,600
When I woke up,
he was lying unconscious.

1204
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,400
His men are waiting out there to kill me.

1205
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,040
So I owned up to the crime
and came to prison.

1206
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,240
Sekar! How are you, son?

1207
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,560
I'm fine.

1208
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,880
Why are you crying now?

1209
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,200
Where's he?
- He's waiting outside.

1210
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,640
Where are you staying?
- At your aunt's place.

1211
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,120
Has Selva regained consciousness?
- No, he's still in coma.

1212
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,120
Time's up.
- We're just leaving, sir.

1213
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,800
Take care of mom.
- Of course.

1214
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,800
I've brought fruits and clothes, Sekar.
- I will take it. Take care.

1215
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,360
Sekar.

1216
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,280
Why are you always
so distracted?

1217
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,600
I'm scared.

1218
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,840
Watch the game.

1219
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,480
Your opponent will always give you
a split second's time.

1220
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,880
That's your time.

1221
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,960
The man who attacks first
will always win.

1222
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,280
In this world, to be somebody,
you must fear nobody.

1223
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,640
The man who gets angry first
is the braver one.

1224
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,600
Survival of the fittest.

1225
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,680
Understand?

1226
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,840
There are people here
who have committed a few murders.

1227
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,200
But everyone calls me the boss.
Know why?

1228
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,280
Make some noise.

1229
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,560
Louder.

1230
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,800
Watch this.

1231
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,720
What happened, brother?

1232
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,000
It's nothing. Carry on.

1233
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,160
- It's nothing.
- Okay, brother

1234
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,760
Noise is everything.

1235
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,760
Understand?

1236
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,320
Hello, Chief.

1237
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,040
So, Murugesan...are you well?
- I'm getting by.

1238
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,640
Why have you become like this?
Bailed out your son?

1239
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,960
They refuse to give him bail.

1240
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,960
What to do?
It's a big case. It won't be easy.

1241
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,920
Goodbye, then.
Start the car.

1242
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,920
Prisoner : 60.

1243
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,600
Sekar, S/O Murugesan.

1244
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,240
You've got bail.
Come to the main gate.

1245
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,000
Where are we going?

1246
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,320
Dad. Where are we going?

1247
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,600
They want contract labourers
at a quarry in Chittoor.

1248
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,320
I have asked them to give you a job, too.
We'll go there.

1249
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,000
Why should we go there?
Let's go to our hometown.

1250
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,840
There are lots of issues in the town.
Let's not go there.

1251
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,040
I sold the plot
to get you out on bail.

1252
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,880
Why did you sell the plot?

1253
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,160
What do I say?

1254
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,680
Pull over, brother.

1255
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,600
Pull over!
- Please wait.

1256
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,240
Where are you going?

1257
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,400
I'll be back. You go ahead.
Take care of mom.

1258
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,680
Oh, so you're out?

1259
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,800
Your story ends today.
I'll come with men.

1260
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,960
So, Sekar...

1261
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,840
You've changed a lot.

1262
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,480
I want to see the chief.
- He's busy...

1263
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,760
Come back later?

1264
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,640
Wait, I'll ask him.

1265
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,360
What's the matter?

1266
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,640
I didn't kill Selva.
But the blame fell on me.

1267
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,880
I don't know what to do.

1268
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,320
I did so much for the Party
because you said so.

1269
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,200
When I was in prison,
the Party did nothing for me.

1270
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,520
I really thought you'd back me up.

1271
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,560
Forget it.

1272
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,840
Everything I did, I did to get my father
a posting in the Party.

1273
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,160
Get him that posting at least now?

1274
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,520
There's a case against you
for killing our Party's District Secretary.

1275
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,080
How can I get your father
a posting now?

1276
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,000
What do you mean?

1277
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,520
This is politics, son.

1278
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,400
You're a kid.

1279
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,760
You won't get it.

1280
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,320
Okay, then.

1281
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,880
Brother...
- What?

1282
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,760
I saw Sekar near the water tank.

1283
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,680
Let's go!

1284
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,120
Mullai Nagar stop.

1285
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,720
Let's go.

1286
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,360
Wake him up.

1287
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,640
Ramalingam!

1288
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,160
He's standing
so tall and confident.

1289
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,320
Yeah, I don't know why.

1290
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,440
He looks so scary.

1291
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,000
Yeah. Let's go away?
- Shut up!

1292
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,080
We must kill him today.

1293
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,560
He could be carrying a weapon!

1294
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,920
Fool! You're holding one, too.

1295
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,880
You go first.

1296
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:45,920
In this world, to be somebody,
you must fear nobody.

1297
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,040
The man who gets angry first
is the braver one.

1298
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,480
Survival of the fittest.

1299
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,120
"He isn't scared
Never and ever"

1300
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,360
"None can dare to confront him"

1301
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,200
Ramalingam, let's run away.

1302
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,760
I didn't do anything!

1303
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,160
Please don't hurt me.

1304
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,400
Let me go!

1305
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,400
Sekar!

1306
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,280
It's just me!

1307
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,440
They've come to meet you.

1308
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,840
The Chief wanted to see you.

1309
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,880
Who?

1310
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,760
Hello.
- Hello, Chief.

1311
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,480
I'm T.C.P.'s District Head, Damodaran.

1312
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,760
I know you very well.

1313
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,600
Selva flung a slipper at me.

1314
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,640
I wanted to meet the man
who attacked him.

1315
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,400
I swear, I didn't do it.

1316
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,440
Exactly.

1317
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,040
That's exactly
what you must say from now.

1318
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,800
Don't worry about the case.
I'll handle it.

1319
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,560
I'll get it sorted in a single trial.

1320
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,800
T.C.P. shall stand by you.

1321
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,840
We've decided to appoint you
the Youth Wing Secretary.

1322
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,040
Money and power choose
a select few men.

1323
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,480
Sekar, it's chosen you today.

1324
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,240
This is my gift to you.

1325
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,360
Keep it.

1326
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,240
Our Party's membership card.

1327
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,600
The Party will take care
of all your needs.

1328
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,720
We'll get your dad a posting,
like you wanted.

1329
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,080
What say?

1330
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,800
Let's do this, Chief.

1331
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,240
"My name is Black-Out;
My name is Black-Out Sekar."

1332
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:18,080
"You can't touch me;
You can't touch me, I'm danger."

1333
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:22,960
"My name is Black-Out;
My name is Black-Out Sekar."

1334
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,640
Hurry up, sister!

1335
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,640
Don't just stand there.
Keep moving.

1336
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,200
Hello!

1337
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,360
Oh, you switched to this Party?
Marvelous!

1338
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,640
Chief!

1339
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:34,960
Sekar!

1340
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,160
Looks vibrant out there.

1341
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,000
I've got the whole town waiting.

1342
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,760
You're doing a great job.

1343
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,040
Two more lorries coming up.

1344
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,760
Elections are in three months.

1345
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,360
We need to win in this district.
Somehow.

1346
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,360
Definitely, Chief.

1347
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,600
Tell me what you want,
the Party will back you.

1348
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,680
That's not necessary...!
- Keep it.

1349
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,600
Okay, then.

1350
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,640
See you, Chief.
- Live long and prosper.

1351
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,120
Welcome, brother.
When did you get out?

1352
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,120
Has the town surrendered?

1353
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,640
I chased a few away.
But town is not in control yet.

1354
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,640
Don't worry.

1355
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,480
Got murderers, acid attackers, sound effects,
petrol bombers, atmosphere guys...

1356
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,880
I've brought everyone.

1357
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,240
They'll always be around you.

1358
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,280
Let's go for a walk?

1359
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,920
"Underdogs and cronies, make way now;
Listen up loud and clear, I run the show."

1360
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,680
See that, Narayanan?

1361
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,720
Time plays wicked games.

1362
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,960
Anaconda, fly our flag over there.

1363
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:32,160
"You can't beat me, I'm the man;
My words is law, I'm shaking up things."

1364
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,920
"My name is Black-Out;
My name is Black-Out Sekar."

1365
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,880
"You can't touch me;
You can't touch me, I'm danger."

1366
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,320
"My name is Black-Out;
My name is Black-Out Sekar."

1367
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,640
"You can't touch me;
You can't touch me, I'm danger."

1368
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,720
We shall not drink!

1369
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,320
We shall not drink!

1370
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,040
We shall not drink alcohol!

1371
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,680
We shall not drink alcohol!

1372
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,640
We shall not drink!
- We shall not drink!

1373
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,920
We shall not drink alcohol!
- We shall not drink alcohol!

1374
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,360
I shall not forget.
- I shall not forget.

1375
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,560
I shall never forget you.
- I shall never forget you.

1376
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,680
Won't broken phones get fixed?
- Won't broken phones get fixed?

1377
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,840
Can't I get my hands on this?
- Can't I get my hands on this?

1378
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,480
We shall not drink!

1379
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,240
We're getting signatures...

1380
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,080
to close down Selva's bar
near the school.

1381
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,640
Everybody, please sign.

1382
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,800
Go to the other streets, too.

1383
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,240
Why are you sealing the bar shut?
- Listen to what I've got to say.

1384
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:45,520
Your townsfolk complained that the bar
is a nuisance to the schools and temples.

1385
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,480
We've received an order
to seal the bar.

1386
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,240
This is a copy of the order.
Don't argue with me.

1387
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,800
Send them away.
- Sir, that's our livelihood.

1388
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,920
He's ruined our livelihoods.

1389
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,160
This mongrel Sekar shut down the bar
when Selva is unconscious.

1390
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,680
When Selva is out of the hospital,
we'll butcher Sekar.

1391
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,800
He's risen to the top.
We can't even touch him.

1392
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,240
Shame on you!

1393
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,520
I'm the King of this town!

1394
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,520
You've shut down the bar.
What next?

1395
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,200
We'll start up my father's business.

1396
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,440
Do this tree next.

1397
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,640
Okay.

1398
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,640
Anaconda...

1399
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,120
Do people believe that I killed
'Iron-fist' Selva or not?

1400
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,440
They believe it.
But who could have killed him?

1401
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,040
Who knows?

1402
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,440
1,000 members from I.P.L.P
have joined our Party, Chief.

1403
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,400
I'll arrange for a meeting
if you wish.

1404
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,760
Just a 1,000 won't do.
Bring in everybody!

1405
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,720
We must control the whole district.

1406
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,960
All hail our Chief Damodaran!

1407
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,560
Hail Chief!

1408
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,800
Hail Chief!

1409
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,640
After Sekar's entry,
Mullai Nagar has become T.C.P's fortress.

1410
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,960
We shall vote for whomever
Sekar tells us to.

1411
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,880
"People may try to bury me;
These people come and go in history."

1412
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,040
"When it comes to war;
All is fair."

1413
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,400
The leader is coming here.
Welcome him, then drink this juice.

1414
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,400
"The noise we make tears eardrums;
The blows we smack will split skulls."

1415
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,920
"My people on my side, I call the shots;
Time for the victory dance."

1416
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,600
Thank you for
sorting this out for me.

1417
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,720
Leader...

1418
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,320
Those numbers are incorrect.

1419
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,280
The people are on our side.

1420
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:53,840
"A leader is born -
To swing the sword."

1421
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,000
Narayanan!

1422
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,720
Come on, harder.
Wash it properly.

1423
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,280
Use a few more brooms.

1424
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,080
Stop it!

1425
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,920
Stop it, or I'll call the police.

1426
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,800
They broke down my wall
without permit.

1427
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,520
What's the problem, sir?

1428
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,920
He's erected a wall
on the way to the cemetery.

1429
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,920
We take a 14km detour
every time someone dies.

1430
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,320
This is for people's welfare.

1431
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,360
They're helping the public.
Don't cause trouble.

1432
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:27,120
"All hail our Chief.
Hail, Chief!"

1433
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:31,680
"All hail our Chief.
Hail, Chief!"

1434
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:37,280
"All hail our Chief.
Hail, Chief!"

1435
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,720
He is blessed.

1436
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,520
The way his stars are aligned...

1437
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,760
no one else can enter his fort.

1438
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,200
He shall be the king,
and the minister too.

1439
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,920
When will he die?

1440
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,840
Say it, man.

1441
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,680
He'll face mortal peril
this June.

1442
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,960
If he escapes that,
you must wait till his next peril.

1443
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,880
Bless me, father.

1444
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,520
Sekar.

1445
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,560
My heart is racing.

1446
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,080
Why is that?

1447
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,040
What have we done wrong?

1448
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,200
I've got you the Union Secretary posting.

1449
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,200
We'll find a good place
and set up an office.

1450
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,400
Don't over-think it.

1451
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,080
We've got our business.
Why enter wretched politics?

1452
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,800
We've seen enough.
I don't need a posting.

1453
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,520
Deep inside,
I feel this is a mistake.

1454
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,960
Dad, just sit down.

1455
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,120
We didn't go after this.

1456
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,560
It happened to us.

1457
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,720
We're going to the top!
Wait and see.

1458
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,400
It's hot outside.

1459
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,720
I'll turn on the air conditioner.
Sit and watch T.V.

1460
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,680
Okay?

1461
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,840
Mom, come here.

1462
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,720
Turn up the volume, brother.

1463
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,640
The legislative assembly elections
are to take place.

1464
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,080
AIADMK, DMK, MDMK...

1465
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,840
DMDK, PMK, VSK, IPLP, TCP...

1466
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,080
and many such parties
shall fight for votes.

1467
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,840
So, the electoral battlefield
is likely to be an interesting one.

1468
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,840
Even the waves in the ocean may rest;
But not our political quest.

1469
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,640
Try to sound more majestic.

1470
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,480
Lions with heart of gold!
Golden hearted Lions!

1471
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:14,280
Lions with heart of gold!
Golden hearted Lions!

1472
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:20,880
My warm greetings to everyone
gathered at Ward 67 this fine evening.

1473
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,480
'Black-Out' Sekar will be honoured
by the senior Party members.

1474
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,520
I-P-L-P
Even the Party's name begs for 'help'.

1475
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,520
Parasuraman!

1476
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,080
You can't even assemble a good wardrobe,
you want to be at legislative assembly?

1477
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,200
You were a batter-boy at Pandian mess...

1478
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:43,160
shall I reveal how you became
the District Secretary?

1479
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,840
These waves shall never cease.
This mountain shall never fall.

1480
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,040
Murthy...here's your cue.

1481
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:52,600
Defy my Party Head...
and I will chop off your head!

1482
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,120
What is it?

1483
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,680
He is doing well.

1484
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,640
I mentored him, after all.

1485
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,200
He's great.

1486
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,480
He is.

1487
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,600
Are we sheep or cattle?

1488
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,320
What happened?

1489
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,960
Nobody move.
Stay put.

1490
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,960
What's going on?
Somebody, go check.

1491
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,680
Who would do such a thing?
Find the culprit.

1492
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,000
Calm down, Sekar.
- How can I be calm?

1493
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:25,000
Parasuraman is playing hide-n-seek
by cutting power, to prevent me from speaking.

1494
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,840
He is violating the codes of war.

1495
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,640
Are we moths that fly away
when the light is put out?

1496
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,520
Are we powerless?

1497
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,160
Parasuraman!

1498
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:40,000
I, Black-Out Sekar, will destroy you at
elections and make you a batter-boy again.

1499
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,560
Excuse me!

1500
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,000
Who is it?
- Need to meet the leader.

1501
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,200
You can't meet him now.

1502
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,840
We're from the Party, too.
- Come back in the morning.

1503
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,520
Tell him we're from Mullai Nagar.
- Go away...

1504
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,760
Come back in the morning.

1505
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,880
Narayanan, let them in.

1506
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,280
We've lost our livelihoods.

1507
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,720
Since Sekar returned,
we've lost everything.

1508
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,120
We live in constant fear.

1509
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,120
Selva was so important to our Party.

1510
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,120
Sekar killed him and now he's risen.

1511
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:20,080
What must you do?
- Tell us what to do.

1512
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,640
He won't let you live.

1513
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,800
You can't survive against him.
Run, and make a living elsewhere.

1514
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,360
As long as he lives,
he won't let you be.

1515
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:31,880
Shall I kill Sekar?

1516
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,520
You can't ask him that!

1517
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,200
Let me tell you.

1518
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,000
Narayanan asked me to meet you.
Get this job done soon.

1519
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,720
Keep it in the prayer room.

1520
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,720
I can't work to suit your pace.
I need to plan it.

1521
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,480
If it's a miss,
the guy will be alerted.

1522
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,400
The next attempt will have to
wait for six months.

1523
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,840
It's not a game. Okay?

1524
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,440
You say he killed Selva.

1525
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,640
It's a risky job...
It'll cost you a lot.

1526
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,240
Drink tea.

1527
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,960
You're our only hope.
Please help us out.

1528
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,680
Does he go walking in the mornings?
- No way.

1529
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,160
Is the toilet inside the house
or outside?

1530
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,760
He's made a lot of money.
He has built one indoors.

1531
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,000
Any affairs?

1532
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,680
No, but he's in love with a girl.

1533
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,000
That's what I meant.

1534
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,440
Here I come.

1535
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,160
Pretty Sundari, won't you talk to me?

1536
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,360
Leave that cycle
and hop on to my motorcycle, darling.

1537
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,760
Let's go around.

1538
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,880
Why so quiet?

1539
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,160
I don't talk to prisoners.

1540
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,560
I didn't do it, baby.
- Liar!

1541
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,720
You say that, but you walk around
like a criminal.

1542
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,440
Does this look like a
criminal's face to you?

1543
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,000
Everyone's scared of you
because of what you did.

1544
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,600
I made a mistake
falling in love with you.

1545
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:01,680
Oh, darn!

1546
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,240
Sundari!

1547
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,880
Hear me out...

1548
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,040
Sundari, wake up.

1549
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,160
Get up!
- What, mother?

1550
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,360
Get up.
- What happened?

1551
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,760
I'll tell you!
Sit here.

1552
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,640
They've come to ask
your hand in marriage.

1553
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,240
I don't want to get married now.

1554
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,880
Shut up!

1555
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,560
Your Uncle has sent them.
They must be a good family.

1556
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,320
I want to study.
- Right.

1557
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,440
You and studies?

1558
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,400
You've failed 12th grade thrice!

1559
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,040
That boy who came home that day...?

1560
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,880
Are you planning to run away with him?

1561
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,720
If word gets out,
who will marry you?

1562
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,240
Sundari...

1563
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,520
Look!

1564
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,840
Look at me.

1565
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,360
I've struggled to raise you.

1566
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,160
Listen to your mother.
- Come on...

1567
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,520
You're always saying that.

1568
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,640
Coming, brother.

1569
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,400
Hold this.

1570
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:56,760
Hold this.

1571
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,880
Get dressed.
Quick.

1572
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,160
Serve everyone coffee.

1573
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,720
"He makes me swoon,
He makes me turn."

1574
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,800
"He plays magic tricks,
That's where he gets his kicks."

1575
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,760
"He's watching me,
He's taunting me."

1576
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,840
"He's crossing the line,
Only to be mine."

1577
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:49,760
"Oh, that glance!
Like stones it stings."

1578
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:58,080
"And my poor heart...
It flutters."

1579
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:38,200
"Your shenanigans are countless.
Should I laugh or frown, my love?"

1580
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:46,600
"You've got me snagged on a hook.
Should I wriggle free or surrender?"

1581
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:54,040
"Joy and sorrow, peace and war;
Put together is the recipe for love."

1582
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:59,240
"Day after day, joy or sorrow...
We'll be together."

1583
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:22,560
"Oh, that glance!
Like stones it stings."

1584
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:30,840
"And my poor heart...
It flutters."

1585
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,080
Get in, buddy.
- Dude...

1586
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,880
I'll take it from here.

1587
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,760
Anaconda, take care
of my mother and father.

1588
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,080
Don't bother me for two days.

1589
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,040
Can I call your phone?
- I won't be reachable.

1590
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,200
Get in the car!

1591
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,160
Off I go!

1592
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,000
Sundari...

1593
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,160
Stop! It's suffocating me.

1594
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,440
Don't touch me.

1595
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:32,280
My head hurts.
Where are we going?

1596
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,680
I'll tell you.

1597
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,480
What's this place?

1598
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,880
Let's just say
it's ours for now.

1599
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:58,800
Come in.

1600
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,440
What happened?

1601
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,360
I won't trust you.

1602
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,720
Stop being difficult. Come in.

1603
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,240
I won't come in.

1604
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:13,640
Fine.

1605
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,400
He's gone to Damodaran's farmhouse.

1606
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,000
We can do it today.

1607
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:39,080
You haven't brought me milk, dear?

1608
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:44,960
Sundari...

1609
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,400
You're always so cool.
Why are you crying?

1610
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,360
I didn't ditch the girl I loved.
You must appreciate me. Why do you cry?

1611
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,960
How could I not cry?

1612
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,680
Now I'll be known
as a thug's wife.

1613
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:00,720
Let me go.

1614
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,200
Look at me.

1615
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,760
I'll tell you the truth.

1616
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,400
Look at me.

1617
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,360
I won't.

1618
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,560
You'll smooth-talk me.

1619
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,760
You've known me for so many years.

1620
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,960
Am I capable of murder?
Look at my face.

1621
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,720
I was furious,
but I got sloshed and blacked-out...

1622
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,080
I woke up to find him
already slaughtered.

1623
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:31,000
I am called 'Black-Out'
because I have low tolerance for alcohol.

1624
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,000
It was a cool name
so I let it be.

1625
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,760
I'm just a Paper-Knife.

1626
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,560
You didn't do it?

1627
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,120
I swear I didn't.
I've been saying that all along.

1628
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,760
They gave me a post at the Party
so I took it.

1629
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,280
I didn't do it.

1630
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,560
Why are you crying?

1631
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,920
Wipe your tears.

1632
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,600
Tell me.

1633
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,400
Okay.

1634
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I'll handle it.

1635
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,000
Okay.

1636
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,400
He's in there.

1637
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:26,760
Get our weapons.

1638
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,600
I'm scared!
- Don't worry, I'm here.

1639
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,560
Sekar, don't go out!
- Who is it?

1640
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,800
Sekar!

1641
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,320
Who is it out there?

1642
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,760
Grab that gun!

1643
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,360
Call everyone.
Yes, fire!

1644
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:59,360
There he goes.
Shoot him!

1645
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,160
Is it the Party Office?

1646
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,920
Bring all our members here.
Immediately!

1647
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:12,240
Don't open the door till I return.
- Don't leave me here!

1648
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,640
Come on now!

1649
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,080
Let's see what you've got.

1650
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,640
I'm Black-Out Sekar!

1651
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,840
Come and show me
what you've got.

1652
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,280
I'll knock you out
with a single punch.

1653
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,440
Messing with 'Black-Out' Sekar?
Come at me.

1654
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,640
Who is it out there?

1655
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:30,920
One punch from Sekar
and you'll throw up your organs.

1656
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,720
Who are you?

1657
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,760
Do you know who I am?

1658
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:35,840
I'm Sekar!

1659
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,680
Not just Sekar.

1660
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,720
I'm Black-Out Sekar!

1661
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:43,360
Messing with the Black-Out Sekar?

1662
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,440
Think you can?

1663
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,520
Why did you slash me, fool?

1664
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,880
Sorry, dude.

1665
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,960
I'll kill you!

1666
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,280
Come any closer
and I'll kill you!

1667
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,960
I'll really kill you.
Just leave!

1668
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,480
Lift him up.

1669
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:39,760
Come here.

1670
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,480
Let me go...

1671
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,400
Akkaru...it's you?

1672
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,440
I didn't attack Selva.
- Kill him.

1673
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,240
Akkaru.

1674
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,800
Akkaru, don't...
- Kill him.

1675
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,720
Don't just watch! Kill him.
- Akkaru, don't...

1676
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,720
I just got married.

1677
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,680
I said, kill him.
- Tell him, don't...

1678
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:02,840
Akkaru...

1679
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,680
Akkaru!

1680
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,200
What is it?
- A call from the Chief.

1681
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,400
Hello?

1682
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,600
Have you killed Sekar?
- I'll bury him and call you.

1683
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,280
The Chief says not to kill him.

1684
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,160
What?

1685
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,680
Don't hurt him.
- I shouldn't?

1686
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,920
Don't hurt him. Come back.

1687
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,200
Okay, brother.

1688
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,360
Let's go.

1689
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,240
He grew up in my home...Sekar.

1690
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,560
Sekar and I...

1691
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,400
we're like two bodies and one soul.

1692
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,200
We're that close.

1693
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,880
The mythical Annam bird can separate
milk and water apart.

1694
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,160
But the bond between our two Parties
cannot be separated.

1695
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,600
This union, has a historic significance.

1696
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:10,240
The reason for our coalition,
is keeping in mind only thing.

1697
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:14,040
People's welfare! People's welfare!
People's welfare!

1698
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,640
Nurse!

1699
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,080
Selva is awake.

1700
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,320
Brother, do you recognise me?

1701
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,680
Tell me, moron.

1702
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,240
Who slashed you?

1703
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,920
Who could slash me?
- One minute.

1704
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,240
Dad, come on stage?

1705
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,120
Why? What will I do?

1706
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,320
You might even be announced
as a candidate in the elections, too.

1707
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,280
You never know.
Get used to it now.

1708
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,200
No...

1709
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,280
Come on, dad.

1710
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,800
Here comes T.C.P's proud lion!

1711
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,080
Hello.

1712
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,520
Tell me what happened.

1713
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:13,120
I was riding past the graveyard.

1714
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,320
A dog came in my way.

1715
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,640
Come here, Sekar!
- Brother?

1716
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,880
You hold a position now.
Don't run errands.

1717
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:52,760
Get up.

1718
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,160
If we sit down, the Party won't run.

1719
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,240
Wow!

1720
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,840
You're a full time politician now?

1721
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,200
You taught me politics, after all.

1722
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,040
You're my mentor!

1723
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:06,280
There's a knife dangling over your head.
Remember that.

1724
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,880
I've got five years now.

1725
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,640
I'll face it.

1726
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,040
Get him a chilled soda.

1727
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:18,960
What's happened?

1728
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,240
Brother?

1729
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,320
Brother!
Doctor...

1730
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,080
What happened, doctor?

1731
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:42,920
He's dead.

1732
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,920
Where is the money in the cupboard?

1733
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,680
I took it. So what?

1734
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,120
Why did you take my wages?

1735
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:36,240
Such a huge meeting
is about to take place.

1736
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,080
T.C.P. has erected so many banners.

1737
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:39,920
We need to put up some banners...

1738
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,240
and show our clout, too.

1739
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,960
Get me my towel.
- Sure.

1740
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,880
You don't care about the family.

1741
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,960
You're running behind Party members.
You think you've got clout?

1742
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,280
You've got no clout!

1743
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:53,840
You shall never go running
behind that Party again!
