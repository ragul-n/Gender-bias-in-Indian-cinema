1
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:59,216
The star I have waited for years!

2
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:02,490
The throne of Bahrestan
will have an heir.

3
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:07,494
Which means this time,
my son won't be stillborn.

4
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:08,625
Certainly not!

5
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:12,504
And this star in the heavens
will always protect our prince.

6
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,834
- May The Lord grant.
- Amen!

7
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:51,002
Happy tidings, Your Majesty!

8
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,017
Thank you Lord!

9
00:03:57,085 --> 00:04:04,514
Thank you for giving me a son!

10
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:07,323
A priceless gift!

11
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,101
Happy tidings, Grand Vizier!

12
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:20,866
The prayers of the people of
Bahrestan have been answered!

13
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,840
The queen has borne a handsome son!

14
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,911
May I expect a reward for
bringing you the news?

15
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:35,983
Reward!

16
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,587
You fool!

17
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:43,988
The midwife! Get her!

18
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:49,597
She betrayed us.
She was trying to escape.

19
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:54,069
I haven't betrayed you!

20
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:56,610
I did whatever you said!

21
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:59,676
I fed her the potion.
As I always did!

22
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:04,310
I even tried to strangIe the child.
But he wouldn't die!

23
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:08,354
Then he's destined to die
at my hands!

24
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:09,754
Yes, my Lord.

25
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,459
An infant's neck. Now that
must be small and soft.

26
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,625
Yes, my Lord.

27
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,331
Tell me, how come the
last 5 infants died?

28
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:26,772
It was your potion.
It worked.

29
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:33,808
But they were sweet and they
were innocent. Like this one.

30
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:38,478
That's why the people of Bahrestan
are rejoicing.

31
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:39,645
Come. Take a look.

32
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,818
You want to join them, don't you?

33
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:47,953
Yes, my Lord.

34
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,657
Well...

35
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:51,091
Go on.

36
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:28,660
My friend Amir Khan, the magician
has come all the way from Hind.

37
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:32,503
He brings me such strange
and exciting gifts.

38
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:43,642
Karan Singh, the Maharaja of Hind,
sends a gift for the Sultan.

39
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:55,755
This sword is for Your Majesty.

40
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,494
Just a sword?
What kind of a gift is this?

41
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:07,635
This sword can cut through rock!

42
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:12,238
Let me try it out.

43
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:39,663
Now let's see if the Grand Vizier
can draw the sword out of the rock.

44
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:43,637
Go ahead, Vizier.

45
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,909
I see I have a lot more
to learn from you.

46
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:30,216
Forgive me Grand Vizier,
but you can never do it.

47
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:37,128
For only one in whose veins courses
the royal blood can draw it out.

48
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,421
Is that so?

49
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:43,303
Very well, then.
Let the sword lie there.

50
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,132
Someday, my son will draw it.

51
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:55,813
Yes, my Sultan?

52
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,944
You are a magician, aren't you?

53
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:02,284
Show us a few tricks.

54
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:05,792
Go on. Show my guests
some of your magic.

55
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:12,162
Do you see this girl?

56
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:16,394
I'm going to turn her into a fairy
with my magical powers.

57
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,200
And she will fly.

58
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:20,996
How is your wife?

59
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,229
I know you're married.

60
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:26,071
By the grace of God,
I have a nephew in your son.

61
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,971
Soon, you will have a nephew
from me.

62
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:31,409
Lovely! So when am I supposed to
travel Hind for congratulating you?

63
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:33,003
Very soon now.

64
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:36,642
Amir Khan, I want to discuss
something important with you.

65
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:42,020
There seems to be a conspiracy
in the brewing.

66
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,388
You? What are you doing here?

67
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:49,220
Making sure you're
safe and sound.

68
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:50,628
Nice to know.

69
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,758
Now Please escort Amir Khan
to his quarters.

70
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:06,504
You and the Sultan are
really thick friends.

71
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:08,640
Why can't we be friends too?

72
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:14,279
ImpossibIe. I'll never make friends
with The Satan.

73
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:17,114
Long live Satan.

74
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:21,184
So you know that I owe allegiance
to The Satan?

75
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,753
It takes foresight
to make a magician.

76
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:26,994
All Satan thinks of
is the present.

77
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:30,560
Surely you haven't thought out
what lies four steps ahead?

78
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:35,974
Right you are. It takes time to know
who the turncoat is.

79
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,178
Is it magic? How do you know?
How do you get wind?

80
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:49,781
By the grace of The Lord,
I know a few tricks.

81
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:54,487
As for the rest of it,
all credit goes to this talisman.

82
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,462
An ascetic in Hind gave it to me.

83
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:00,091
Do you know what makes it
so special?

84
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:03,604
One who wears it is unassailable.

85
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:09,200
Not even time can age one who
wears this. That's why I wear it.

86
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,810
So that's the magic of the Hind?

87
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:19,481
Please...

88
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,187
What are you doing?

89
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:30,355
What's going on?

90
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:34,365
Traitor! Son of the Satan!

91
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:42,941
Traitor I am. And the throne
goes to the son of Satan!

92
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:45,806
Throw him in the dungeons.

93
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,512
Long live Satan!

94
00:17:56,357 --> 00:18:02,421
May The Lord always protect my son.

95
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:07,400
May he become a courageous
and kind Sultan.

96
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,464
And not only in Bahrestan.

97
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:16,408
The world over, may he be known
as the Emperor of Peace.

98
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:19,702
Amen!

99
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:38,554
Open up.

100
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,743
Hack them to pieces!

101
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:09,285
What happened?

102
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:11,831
Where is the Sultan?

103
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:20,536
I'm taking you to a secret place.

104
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:23,941
Then I'll come back, and I'll finish
that traitor of a Vizier.

105
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,884
Long live Satan!

106
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:42,857
Careful, my Sultan!

107
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:01,079
Lord! Help us!

108
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:02,172
My son!

109
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:04,978
My Lord! Strike!

110
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,518
My Sultan!

111
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:13,825
Long live Satan!

112
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:50,959
What brings the fish?

113
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:57,994
A boy!

114
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:25,555
This is your gift to me!
I'll bring this child up.

115
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:27,760
I'll tell him about you.

116
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,995
Thank you, Lord.

117
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:37,370
Stone him!

118
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,214
He killed our Sultan and our Queen!

119
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:44,681
He has killed our prince!

120
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:45,980
Stone him!

121
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,084
Stop!

122
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,903
That treacherous magician
killed our beloved Sultan.

123
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:08,636
You give too easy a death
to this assassin.

124
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:14,074
Malm him! Give him a wound
that may never heal.

125
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:19,518
Let him carry his own carcass
as long as he lives.

126
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:20,611
Take him away.

127
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:31,254
Long live The Sultan.

128
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:34,026
Long live The Sultan!

129
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:36,797
No. Not The Sultan.

130
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:39,065
Long live Satan.

131
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:51,875
In all my innocence,
I suffer like this!

132
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:59,686
The truth must out!

133
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:04,992
Else my wife will be told
a pack of lies.

134
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,693
And she is pregnant.
Oh what is she to do?

135
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:14,499
And Anwar, that scoundrel!
What is he going to do to her?

136
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:19,601
Zarina!

137
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,911
Your Majesty, this is Zarina.

138
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:29,252
The wife of your court magician,
Amir Khan. Amir Khan has killed...

139
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:38,664
the Sultan of Bahrestan. And he
killed my sister and her son.

140
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:46,804
For the heinous crime
Amir Khan has committed...

141
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:50,674
I plead before Your Majesty
to punish his wife Zarina.

142
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:57,745
In Bahrestan, Amir Khan has been
sentenced for his crime.

143
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:03,683
Zarina is innocent of the crime.
According to tradition in Hind...

144
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:08,627
even if she were guilty, she couldn't
be punished. Because she is pregnant.

145
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,730
Lady Zarina, I regret
whatever has happened.

146
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:17,362
I hereby exonerate you.

147
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:29,980
She mustn't escape!

148
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:32,112
She can't get away.

149
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:03,774
The elephant! It's coming at us!

150
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:13,115
kill it.

151
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:15,649
Only Lord can help us now.

152
00:26:24,732 --> 00:26:26,723
Please do not take this ring
away from me.

153
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,894
It's a memento from my wife.

154
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:31,699
The new Sultan has summoned you.

155
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:39,913
Welcome, Amir.

156
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:47,245
Do you know why you're alive?
To serve this Satan cast in iron.

157
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:52,120
I can use him to rule the world!

158
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,223
And you are the only one
who can bring it to life.

159
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:03,828
But you have taken my talisman
away from me, my Lord.

160
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:06,168
Without it, I can do nothing.

161
00:27:06,774 --> 00:27:10,801
Make no mistake, Your Majesty.

162
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:14,370
Give it to him, and he flies!

163
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:24,988
If you don't get to work right away,
you're going to the torture chamber.

164
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:36,066
Do not be vain. The one who
will slay you has been born.

165
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:37,967
Who?

166
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:40,036
Ajooba

167
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:41,964
Ajooba?

168
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:55,749
Mother!

169
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:19,979
Know one. Know all.

170
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:27,010
The reason you are being treated
like this because you are traitors.

171
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:33,216
Long live Satan!

172
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:43,164
The entire harvest
goes to the treasury.

173
00:28:52,946 --> 00:29:00,045
Every able man is to serve
in the armies.

174
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,581
I paid the taxes.
This is extortion!

175
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:13,563
Every maiden goes
to the royal harem.

176
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:19,365
Long live Satan!

177
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:25,070
Anyone who dares disobey,
will be beheaded.

178
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:05,279
No ills can evil-doers perpetrate.

179
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:08,116
All that happens is willed
by The Lord.

180
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:21,365
These are the arrows
Ajooba used on our soldiers.

181
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:23,699
The arrows are different from
the ones used by our armies.

182
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:29,602
Ajooba! The man in the mask
whose face none has seen!

183
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:35,478
But he stands alone.
And he kills my soldiers!

184
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:43,848
And he robs my granaries!
And he frees my slaves!

185
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:53,625
And the cowards that you are,
you present me his arrows!

186
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,689
Shame on you!

187
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:01,904
Salaam, Sultan-e-Ali.

188
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,141
Ansari, you are my brother.

189
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:17,680
And Altaf my son, someday
you will become the Sultan.

190
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:23,927
I want you to help me
in the administration.

191
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:29,435
Reward my brave soldiers.

192
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:39,442
And tend to the wounds of those
who have survived Ajooba.

193
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:57,153
You can vent your anger against
your own men.

194
00:31:57,231 --> 00:31:58,698
But that won't kill Ajooba.

195
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:04,497
Shah Rukh, had you not been
my wife's brother...

196
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:08,132
you would've been no more than
a foot soldier. Consider that.

197
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:14,704
To the people of Bahrestan,
Ajooba is a messiah!

198
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:18,217
Their lips are sealed.

199
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:20,253
Not even for a price?

200
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,247
Well said!

201
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:38,261
Go out to the streets of Bahrestan
and hand out gold, cloth and food.

202
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:46,109
Feed the dogs. When their stomachs
are full, then they will speak.

203
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:48,477
About Ajooba.

204
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:55,278
Long live Satan!

205
00:32:58,425 --> 00:33:06,298
The Sultan has proclaimed that
no one will go hungry in Bahrestan.

206
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:10,469
All the needs of the people
will be taken care of.

207
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:15,635
The Sultan sends you
food and clothes.

208
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:20,506
No one is Bahrestan
must go to bed hungry.

209
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:25,881
Eat. Eat your fill.

210
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,839
You will be served the
choicest food every day.

211
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,105
You will be given clothes.

212
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:59,176
And for those who tell us
about Ajooba... a home.

213
00:33:59,286 --> 00:34:03,552
For the sake of the country, it is
very important to apprehend Ajooba.

214
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,404
I don't want it.
I don't want your bread.

215
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:33,043
- We don't want your bread.
- Take your bread away!

216
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,180
The Sultan will be informed
of this insult.

217
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:44,762
The bread that you have given back
is proof of your loyalty.

218
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:51,532
The Lord is witness.
And Ajooba appreciates that.

219
00:34:51,605 --> 00:34:58,374
Promise that you will die
rather than betray Ajooba.

220
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:01,414
- It's a promise!
- We promise!

221
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:12,758
One dime. Just one dime.
May The Lord give you plenty.

222
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:19,197
One dime for a poor woman.
May The Lord give you plenty.

223
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:20,255
She is the one.

224
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,893
Spare a dime, good souls.
The Lord will give you hundredfold.

225
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:28,140
You refuse what we give you.
And you try to fool people.

226
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,700
A dime for you, and The Lord
gives in plenty, eh?

227
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,843
Yes, my son. The Lord giveth.

228
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:41,710
Then I will give you one gold coin.

229
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:44,450
And you must get your Lord
to give me that hundredfold.

230
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:49,492
May The Lord grant you.

231
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,324
Tell Him to give me
my hundredfold.

232
00:35:54,468 --> 00:35:55,457
He will.

233
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:57,463
When?

234
00:35:58,238 --> 00:35:59,967
An man without patience.

235
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:06,973
Here... take your coin back.

236
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:11,814
I'll give you something more.

237
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:15,653
Get your Lord to pay me back
a hundredfold.

238
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:23,819
Go on. Tell him to give me
a hundredfold.

239
00:36:25,365 --> 00:36:28,095
Wait. And He will pay you back.

240
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:19,076
No ills can evil-doers perpetrate.

241
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:21,643
All that happens is willed
by The Lord.

242
00:37:36,436 --> 00:37:39,530
You ask for a hundredfold?

243
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:43,201
Start counting. Till a hundred.

244
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,770
But she said The Lord will give me.

245
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:52,580
The Lord sends me.
To settle your score.

246
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:01,950
One

247
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:06,821
Two

248
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:09,958
How many was that?

249
00:38:10,036 --> 00:38:11,025
Three

250
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:14,330
Up and start counting.

251
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:22,907
Spare him.

252
00:38:22,983 --> 00:38:28,751
The Lord sees all.
He will punish him.

253
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:34,553
The Lord won't come down
to punish the evil.

254
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:39,622
The man He chooses to do His bidding,
will rise to challenge tyranny.

255
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:43,299
This tyrant I will kill.

256
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:46,099
Here's for you, Shah Rukh.

257
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:57,916
Enough, Ajooba. Let him go.

258
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:09,653
Have mercy, my son.
Let him go.

259
00:39:31,384 --> 00:39:36,549
Thank The Lord that I've spared you.
And it's because she told me to.

260
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:43,461
But remember, if you ever raise
your hand against the poor...

261
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,896
I will break your hands.

262
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:56,433
Ajooba! I heard about you.
I heard you're kind.

263
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:58,704
And now I have seen for myself.

264
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,708
Mother, come with me.

265
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:06,785
Where will you take me?

266
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:09,048
Let this old blind beggar
stay where she is.

267
00:40:18,598 --> 00:40:23,558
Mother, you have called me
your son.

268
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:26,730
will a son ever leave his mother
to beg on the streets?

269
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:30,739
I am not begging for myself.

270
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:33,744
There are so many around me
who are hungry.

271
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:37,141
- I must feed them.
- They will be fed.

272
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:40,413
Come with me.

273
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:42,987
God bless you, Ajooba!

274
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:44,921
May you live long!

275
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:46,959
May Lord grant your every wish!

276
00:41:08,915 --> 00:41:09,904
Coming.

277
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:15,782
From now, you live here.

278
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:19,013
Feed her.

279
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:23,961
Make sure the beggars in the ghetto
are fed every day.

280
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,156
All right.

281
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:30,259
My mother wishes that none of them
may go hungry.

282
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,484
Hurry!

283
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:58,260
Where is Ajooba?

284
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:00,454
Who is Ajooba?

285
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:02,194
The fellow who brought
this old woman here.

286
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:04,828
I don't know.

287
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:06,700
Look everywhere.

288
00:42:07,974 --> 00:42:08,963
Hurry!

289
00:42:18,985 --> 00:42:21,317
Looks like we have more customers
than we cooked for.

290
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:22,854
We're going to run out of food.

291
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,858
Go away from here.

292
00:42:27,026 --> 00:42:28,857
The Sultan's men
were asking for you.

293
00:42:30,663 --> 00:42:34,121
They came looking for Ajooba.
Not for me.

294
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:43,065
A blind woman sees
with her ears.

295
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:51,081
And a mother knows.

296
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:55,114
Where are you going?

297
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:56,280
We're looking for Ajooba.

298
00:42:56,823 --> 00:42:58,222
Ajooba? Here?

299
00:42:59,158 --> 00:43:01,456
Ajooba doesn't come here.
He's scared of me.

300
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:02,617
Scared?

301
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:05,755
He's as much scared of me
as you are.

302
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:06,821
What?

303
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,027
One day, he and l stood staring
at each other.

304
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:14,639
He was standing. Just like this.
And with him were two of his men.

305
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:18,733
And here I was.
Two steps away.

306
00:43:18,811 --> 00:43:21,644
He took a step forward.
I took two.

307
00:43:21,948 --> 00:43:23,006
And then!

308
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:27,915
I kicked Ajooba.
And you go down?

309
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:31,148
One kick and I fell a man as strong
as a tree! Ajooba's no match for me.

310
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,351
Found him?

311
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:35,919
He's nowhere.

312
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:39,865
Now what did I tell you?
You won't find Ajooba...

313
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:42,663
- anywhere near me!
- Who are you?

314
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:48,164
If you can't find Ajooba, the least
you should know is who I am.

315
00:43:48,574 --> 00:43:49,632
Who are you?

316
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,005
First, who are you?

317
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:53,067
Sharafat Khan.

318
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:54,168
Your father?

319
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:55,236
Latafat Khan.

320
00:43:55,315 --> 00:43:56,577
And on to your grandfather.

321
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:57,975
My grandfather was

322
00:43:58,151 --> 00:44:01,882
No. Not your grandfather.

323
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,856
Tell me, do you know who is called
''The Lion of the Faith''?

324
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:05,913
Ali

325
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:08,858
Let's all say Ya Ali!
(Glory to Ali)

326
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,336
What's your name?

327
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:29,404
Ya Ali! My name is Ali.

328
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:50,620
You're all right, aren't you?

329
00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:52,054
PerfectIy.

330
00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:56,468
I was so worried for you.

331
00:50:56,535 --> 00:51:00,699
The Vizier's men couId've
taken you away.

332
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:06,339
No one can take me unIess
The Lord wills it.

333
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:12,614
Fortunate is the mother
who bore you.

334
00:51:13,552 --> 00:51:17,682
You are brave. And you're kind.

335
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:23,284
Won't you take me
to see your mother?

336
00:51:24,363 --> 00:51:25,352
To my mother?

337
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:28,628
I want to thank her.

338
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:35,398
All right. I'll take you
to my mother. Come.

339
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:04,095
Isn't it the sands under my feet?
This is a strange pIace.

340
00:52:05,304 --> 00:52:07,431
Does your mother live here?

341
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:15,112
Yes. We are on the seashore.

342
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:17,272
Here's where my mother lives.

343
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:19,647
Sit here. I'll introduce you
to my mother.

344
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,447
Mother

345
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:02,490
Mother, someone has come to see you.

346
00:53:03,696 --> 00:53:05,493
My saIaams.

347
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:10,998
She is greeting you.

348
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:21,506
I don't understand...
who is this?

349
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:25,541
This is a fish.

350
00:53:28,521 --> 00:53:29,818
A fish?

351
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:30,878
Yes.

352
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:33,652
You call it a mother? A fish?

353
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:48,328
Yes.

354
00:53:50,976 --> 00:53:54,605
Like peopIe who buiId castIes
in the sand...

355
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:01,643
and Iiken them to reaI ones,
so this fish and I.

356
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,952
We pretend we are son and mother,
and we Iove each other.

357
00:54:10,863 --> 00:54:14,560
In her, I see my mother.

358
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:19,567
And to her, I am a son.

359
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,968
She doesn't understand
what I say.

360
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:29,879
And I don't understand her.
But Iove speaks no Ianguage.

361
00:54:29,949 --> 00:54:39,847
And Iove transcends form.
And I Iove to see her.

362
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:48,796
In her embrace, I feeI the warmth
of my mother's Iove.

363
00:54:51,737 --> 00:54:57,004
I make myseIf beIieve that
I have found a mother's Iove.

364
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:13,353
There is fire in these tears.

365
00:55:14,893 --> 00:55:17,794
You miss your mother don't you?

366
00:55:17,863 --> 00:55:24,598
Come, I shall be a mother to you.
I will give you a mother's Iove.

367
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,638
God bless you.

368
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:35,643
May The Lord bring your mother
back to you.

369
00:55:37,783 --> 00:55:41,048
Hearken to a mother, Lord!

370
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:48,390
Do not take a son away
from his mother!

371
00:56:15,721 --> 00:56:18,849
Beware!

372
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:26,690
Beware! Princess Henna is passing.

373
00:56:27,966 --> 00:56:30,662
CIear the streets.

374
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:35,696
Shut your doors and windows.

375
00:56:35,808 --> 00:56:39,369
No one must peep at the princess.

376
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:46,817
Anyone found disobeying,
will be whipped in pubIic.

377
00:57:21,053 --> 00:57:24,545
''The day He created beauty,
The day He created Iove...''

378
00:57:24,623 --> 00:57:27,592
''That day He opened my eyes
But that day, He hid you from me''

379
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:28,648
Who is it?

380
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:30,524
Stop the paIanquin.

381
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:35,760
Where did that voice come from?

382
00:57:37,202 --> 00:57:38,863
From here.

383
00:57:41,406 --> 00:57:42,964
From a cIay pot?

384
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:48,411
If man who was moIded of cIay
may speak, why not cIay itseIf?

385
00:57:49,348 --> 00:57:53,045
This is you. And this is me.
Please do accept a gift.

386
00:57:58,957 --> 00:58:02,859
You the princess draped in goId.
And I am but a cIay doII.

387
00:58:03,462 --> 00:58:04,451
Who are you?

388
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:10,958
''Lover of beauty. Love, my reIigion.
Human I am. But I am a firefIy.''

389
00:58:12,004 --> 00:58:14,973
Come out. I wish to see you.

390
00:58:27,419 --> 00:58:28,886
What is your name?

391
00:58:28,954 --> 00:58:32,981
Hassan. The philanderer.

392
00:58:33,058 --> 00:58:36,892
Like the bee, the hummingbird
and the firefIy.

393
00:58:38,564 --> 00:58:40,464
Are you a poet?

394
00:58:40,532 --> 00:58:41,624
No.

395
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:46,364
The words weII out of my heart
in praise of your beauty.

396
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:48,565
I'm just a poor potter.

397
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,131
I have a cIay house.
And a bed of cIay.

398
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,110
Even my heart is made of cIay?

399
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,741
Are potters poor?

400
00:58:57,683 --> 00:58:58,741
Very poor.

401
00:59:00,352 --> 00:59:02,912
At times, one can't find
two square meaIs a day.

402
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:05,149
Try a snack!

403
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:06,213
Snacks?

404
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:11,024
I'll teII my father to send
snacks to all potters.

405
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:16,056
Touché!

406
00:59:16,735 --> 00:59:21,468
Your father beIieves in snatching
a morseI out of a dog's mouth.

407
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,872
Mind you, my father
isn't Iike that.

408
00:59:24,076 --> 00:59:25,907
Not to be angry.

409
00:59:25,978 --> 00:59:28,970
I'm not asking for snacks.
All I'm Iooking for is love.

410
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:30,173
Let's Ieave.

411
00:59:30,249 --> 00:59:31,773
Just one moment!

412
00:59:33,218 --> 00:59:38,053
will you not give me a token
of your Iove?

413
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:41,991
I have given you my heart.
will I not have my reward?

414
00:59:48,767 --> 00:59:50,325
Get him!

415
01:01:29,735 --> 01:01:32,795
One of these days, you're going
to get yourseIf killed.

416
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:36,068
Love is a killer disease. How many
times am I going to save your neck?

417
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:40,874
Thank me for giving you
one more chance.

418
01:01:40,946 --> 01:01:43,210
I'd rather you were dead.

419
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:47,047
And then you'll be left all alone.
You haven't a souI in this worId.

420
01:01:48,153 --> 01:01:53,216
If you don't give up philandering,
I'm going to dump you.

421
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,553
Like this.

422
01:07:13,478 --> 01:07:22,250
My IittIe friend, I have sent
so many messages to my wife.

423
01:07:22,387 --> 01:07:24,252
But not a singIe repIy.

424
01:07:25,757 --> 01:07:33,061
You must come back with a repIy.
May The Lord protect you.

425
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:07,298
What did you say?

426
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,294
You've come from Bahrestan?

427
01:08:10,668 --> 01:08:13,603
With a message from my father?

428
01:08:18,476 --> 01:08:20,239
Mother!

429
01:08:20,311 --> 01:08:22,176
Abba (father) is alive!

430
01:08:25,683 --> 01:08:27,048
Abba is alive!

431
01:08:27,118 --> 01:08:29,609
What did you say? He's alive?

432
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:33,316
Is this true?

433
01:08:33,391 --> 01:08:36,258
Lord! Is this a dream?!

434
01:08:36,327 --> 01:08:39,660
Rukhsana, you aren't joking with me?

435
01:08:39,731 --> 01:08:42,029
Joke was what destiny did to us.

436
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,968
And the truth is that my father
sends us a message.

437
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,207
Hear what he says?
Abba is innocent!

438
01:08:52,277 --> 01:08:55,769
He didn't kill The Sultan,
his queen and his son!

439
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:57,542
I knew it!

440
01:08:57,882 --> 01:09:00,112
I'll go to Bahrestan!
And I'll bring Abba back.

441
01:09:00,552 --> 01:09:05,251
- I'll come with you too!
- No. You're iII.

442
01:09:05,323 --> 01:09:10,420
By the time you're cured,
I will be back. With Abba.

443
01:09:10,595 --> 01:09:12,586
But you... all alone?

444
01:09:12,797 --> 01:09:16,096
I have your blessings with me.

445
01:09:38,723 --> 01:09:44,161
And he said, I will punish you.
She said, no! forgive me!

446
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:46,354
Any news of Abba?

447
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:49,525
And he said, we must save Abba.
Somehow! We must!

448
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:52,399
The dungeons are heaviIy guarded.

449
01:09:54,372 --> 01:09:59,275
CIear the way!

450
01:09:59,377 --> 01:10:02,904
Prince AItaf is passing.

451
01:10:13,258 --> 01:10:16,284
HaIt. Who is this girI?

452
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:17,589
Hey girI. Come here.

453
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:22,591
Mind your tongue.

454
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:27,627
Don't you know you're supposed
to bow before the royaI entourage.

455
01:10:27,906 --> 01:10:34,209
In Hind, the land I come from,
the head is never bowed.

456
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:40,208
In Hind, women are respected.

457
01:10:40,752 --> 01:10:46,088
Such anger! Like a cIoudburst.

458
01:10:46,157 --> 01:10:48,682
I just Iove it!

459
01:10:49,027 --> 01:10:51,086
Let's add her to the taxes.

460
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:46,711
AItaf's men are returning
with the taxes.

461
01:11:48,886 --> 01:11:53,323
Taxes? That's the bIood and sweat
of the peopIe of Bahrestan!

462
01:11:55,226 --> 01:12:00,789
Let's rob the trove! It'd pay for
weapons. We can wrest our rights.

463
01:12:00,865 --> 01:12:02,696
We'II put an end to
the Vizier's tyranny!

464
01:12:02,767 --> 01:12:06,703
And then I'll marry Henna!
And we'II live in a cIay house.

465
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:08,739
And my cIay bed!
I'll even have kids of cIay!

466
01:12:08,806 --> 01:12:09,795
Shut up!

467
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:11,803
Come on!

468
01:12:28,793 --> 01:12:29,851
What's that noise?

469
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:41,681
Who are you?

470
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:45,918
Ajooba

471
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:54,164
You saved my Iife.
Thank you very much.

472
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:56,706
- You must be from Hind?
- Yes.

473
01:14:57,041 --> 01:15:01,273
The Vizier is hoIding my father.
I want to Iiberate my father.

474
01:15:02,413 --> 01:15:06,782
All of Bahrestan awaits liberation.
And the day is near.

475
01:15:14,959 --> 01:15:17,018
Something happened?

476
01:15:17,094 --> 01:15:18,755
Please take the Iady
wherever she wants to go.

477
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:20,730
What about bringing her back someday?

478
01:15:26,904 --> 01:15:28,201
Wait, Please.

479
01:15:30,942 --> 01:15:34,503
A gift. From the peopIe of Hind.

480
01:15:42,687 --> 01:15:46,919
Rukhsana, you're a beauty, you know.

481
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:51,291
Pretty enough to make a man Iike me
fall in love at first sight!

482
01:15:51,362 --> 01:16:01,135
But I'm aIready in Iove, you know.
With the Princess Henna.

483
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:07,735
WhiIe on Henna, I'll confess that
she doesn't yet reciprocate my Iove.

484
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:09,871
But one day, she will.

485
01:16:12,116 --> 01:16:16,314
You must be wondering how can a poor
potter be in Iove with a princess?

486
01:16:16,387 --> 01:16:18,582
SimpIe. I'll teII you.

487
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:22,788
She's the girI!

488
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:27,522
We'II get goId dinars for her!

489
01:16:27,598 --> 01:16:30,863
Let's kidnap her!

490
01:16:30,935 --> 01:16:33,699
Hurry! Before AItaf
gets her once again!

491
01:16:33,804 --> 01:16:35,066
Come on!

492
01:16:38,009 --> 01:16:43,572
Some day, when the princess
is taking a waIk in the gardens...

493
01:16:43,648 --> 01:16:53,353
I'll drop in. I'll cIamp my hand over
her mouth. And I'll take her away!

494
01:16:53,524 --> 01:16:55,822
As simpIe as that.

495
01:16:57,862 --> 01:17:00,126
You're Iistening, aren't you?

496
01:17:00,197 --> 01:17:05,931
So you see, it takes a Iot of
digging earth to get goId.

497
01:17:06,003 --> 01:17:08,836
So it's an age-oId reIationship
between cIay and goId.

498
01:17:08,973 --> 01:17:10,998
It's as oId as Iove.

499
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:13,737
I gave her a cIay doII
and one goIden doII.

500
01:17:13,811 --> 01:17:16,211
And I kissed her!

501
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,942
I'm smart, right?

502
01:17:20,284 --> 01:17:25,813
Coward! Good for nothing!

503
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:31,624
If you can't win by might,
use your brains. Use pIoys.

504
01:17:31,696 --> 01:17:36,633
I tried it. The beggars refused
the bread we gave them.

505
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:40,262
Had you not been my wife's brother,
you wouId've been a foot soldier.

506
01:17:40,338 --> 01:17:42,772
- Consider that.
- I've thought it over.

507
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,570
There's a woman. A beggar.
She instigated the others...

508
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:47,110
to give up the bread.
And Ajooba took her away.

509
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:51,881
Find her! Bring her to me.

510
01:17:52,116 --> 01:17:56,177
- Very weII, Abba.
- After we have captured her...

511
01:17:56,253 --> 01:18:01,885
you must threaten to kill her
if Ajooba doesn't surrender.

512
01:18:02,059 --> 01:18:07,258
This I entrust you with.
Get me the beggar.

513
01:18:07,331 --> 01:18:10,823
Ajooba is going to be trapped.

514
01:18:10,901 --> 01:18:15,770
And I'll hang him
at the crossroads.

515
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:21,210
Then his men will live in fear.

516
01:18:21,278 --> 01:18:25,977
Never again must they
rise in rebeIIion.

517
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:28,143
Long live Satan!

518
01:18:40,164 --> 01:18:45,898
Hear all ye who live in Bahrestan.

519
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:50,134
This be toId to Ajooba...
wherever he is...

520
01:18:50,207 --> 01:18:59,809
The Sultan is holding the beggar
whom Ajooba calls his mother.

521
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:04,377
If Ajooba wants
the oId woman to live...

522
01:19:04,455 --> 01:19:11,759
then today before sundown, he will
present himseIf before the Sultan.

523
01:19:11,829 --> 01:19:18,166
Failing which, the old woman
will be executed.

524
01:19:31,215 --> 01:19:36,881
Wherever you are, hear this.

525
01:19:36,954 --> 01:19:48,855
The old hag you call your mother
is under my arrest.

526
01:19:48,933 --> 01:19:57,966
If you don't turn yourseIf in,
she will be executed. In pubIic.

527
01:20:00,277 --> 01:20:05,305
No Ajooba! Don't give yourseIf up
for my sake!

528
01:20:05,382 --> 01:20:07,816
Don't let this injustice
happen to yourseIf.

529
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:09,682
Let me die. I'm oId.

530
01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:15,024
The country needs you.

531
01:20:15,092 --> 01:20:16,923
Think about your country.

532
01:20:16,994 --> 01:20:18,120
SiIence!

533
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:24,497
But the fear of your tyranny
doesn't seaI our Iips any Ionger!

534
01:20:24,568 --> 01:20:29,267
Your Iips! The Iips of these peopIe
who live at my mercy!

535
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:32,639
Today, they die too!

536
01:20:33,878 --> 01:20:40,716
Ajooba! This is your Iast chance!
Surrender yourseIf!

537
01:20:54,832 --> 01:20:58,700
Don't Ajooba!
Don't do this!

538
01:21:00,371 --> 01:21:01,861
Go away!

539
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:03,463
Don't come here!

540
01:21:13,417 --> 01:21:14,816
soldiers!

541
01:21:14,885 --> 01:21:19,948
Give him a thousand deaths!

542
01:21:20,024 --> 01:21:22,515
He must be dead before
he falls off the saddle!

543
01:21:22,693 --> 01:21:29,223
Ajooba! Don't! Don't give
yourseIf up to this tyrant!

544
01:21:30,401 --> 01:21:33,802
Mercy!

545
01:21:55,926 --> 01:21:59,487
AItaf, tear his mask away.

546
01:21:59,563 --> 01:22:01,793
Let me see who this Ajooba was.

547
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:22,710
Ajooba! He's stiII alive!

548
01:22:26,257 --> 01:22:27,884
Thank God!

549
01:22:33,163 --> 01:22:35,154
Ansari!

550
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:36,655
My brother!

551
01:22:47,211 --> 01:22:48,678
Where is Ajooba?

552
01:22:55,452 --> 01:22:58,182
Don't let him escape! kill him!

553
01:23:27,985 --> 01:23:32,046
No ills can evil-doers perpetrate.

554
01:23:32,122 --> 01:23:35,216
All that happens is willed
by The Lord.

555
01:24:24,975 --> 01:24:26,272
What is it?

556
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:29,135
I hear you brew a fine tea?

557
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:52,665
You know, I want to see Ajooba.

558
01:24:52,736 --> 01:24:53,760
Ajooba?

559
01:24:53,837 --> 01:24:55,668
Yes. He comes here, doesn't he?

560
01:24:55,739 --> 01:24:57,764
I've never seen him here.

561
01:24:57,841 --> 01:24:59,502
WeII, Ali might know something.

562
01:25:01,111 --> 01:25:03,705
Ali? Is Ali here?

563
01:25:03,781 --> 01:25:05,305
Yes. He's in there.

564
01:25:05,549 --> 01:25:06,538
Come with me.

565
01:25:06,617 --> 01:25:07,606
Inside?

566
01:25:08,685 --> 01:25:09,709
Come on.

567
01:25:10,687 --> 01:25:12,314
Ali, he's looking for Ajooba.

568
01:25:13,257 --> 01:25:17,216
Lord protect me from the eviI eye!

569
01:25:17,294 --> 01:25:21,287
- Yes, what do you want?
- Can you find Ajooba for me?

570
01:25:21,365 --> 01:25:22,627
Have you lost him aIready?

571
01:25:22,699 --> 01:25:24,997
Lost? But I've never met him.

572
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:30,601
He met me once. And I gave him
the Iashing of his Iife!

573
01:25:30,674 --> 01:25:33,040
He'II be here in some time.
He's asking for my saIves.

574
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:34,771
- Why your saIves?
- Why shouId I teII you that?

575
01:25:35,446 --> 01:25:37,778
I couId put him away for good.

576
01:25:37,848 --> 01:25:40,043
I'll turn him into a she-ass.
And I'll take him away.

577
01:25:40,551 --> 01:25:42,519
An ass? How come?

578
01:25:42,586 --> 01:25:44,417
I work a magic.

579
01:25:44,488 --> 01:25:45,614
Here's my magic.

580
01:25:46,623 --> 01:25:49,183
All I have to do...

581
01:25:49,293 --> 01:25:51,386
is bIow this ash on Ajooba.

582
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:54,920
And Ajooba will turn into an ass.

583
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:59,067
You mean a whiff of ash
turns a man into an ass?

584
01:25:59,303 --> 01:26:00,361
True.

585
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:09,040
Curse my Iuck!

586
01:26:09,613 --> 01:26:11,911
I can't speak!

587
01:26:12,616 --> 01:26:14,914
And I'm going to go naked!

588
01:26:17,087 --> 01:26:19,521
Ali! What are you doing
with the ass?

589
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:21,080
It's a she-ass.

590
01:26:21,158 --> 01:26:23,183
- She-ass?
- He was a magician.

591
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,750
He came here trying to make
a ass out of Ajooba.

592
01:26:24,828 --> 01:26:26,056
I made a she-ass of him.

593
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:30,361
WeII done! I'll let
my ass have her!

594
01:26:30,434 --> 01:26:32,402
No! Don't!

595
01:26:32,936 --> 01:26:36,463
Make sure you tie him up.
EIse, he's IikeIy to escape.

596
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:37,529
I mean she!

597
01:26:42,246 --> 01:26:45,181
It's been weeks now!

598
01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:48,377
It couId be months before
I get to see Henna!

599
01:26:48,452 --> 01:26:50,886
I can't get inside the fort.
It's guarded heaviIy.

600
01:26:50,954 --> 01:26:53,252
What do I do now?
And you won't heIp me!

601
01:26:53,323 --> 01:26:55,883
- Find a way!
- We'II find a way.

602
01:26:55,959 --> 01:26:57,426
Come on. Let's taIk
to my father.

603
01:26:57,528 --> 01:27:01,396
- The dress pinches!
- It can't be the fabric!

604
01:27:01,465 --> 01:27:04,366
- She's one of her handmaiden!
- So what?

605
01:27:04,434 --> 01:27:06,061
She's the princess' masseuse!

606
01:27:06,136 --> 01:27:07,433
TaIk to my father!

607
01:27:10,207 --> 01:27:15,611
- The button! It hurts the princess.
- You wanted it!

608
01:27:20,217 --> 01:27:22,344
This fellow is an expert
with the buttons.

609
01:27:22,419 --> 01:27:25,479
Take that button off.
It hurts the princess.

610
01:27:25,556 --> 01:27:28,457
You'll wait for it till
you don't get it back!

611
01:27:30,327 --> 01:27:36,459
Don't you take that ass
into the fort.

612
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,760
This one chance I had
in my life!

613
01:27:41,838 --> 01:27:46,639
I'll have my day.

614
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:49,440
I spent all my life
learning tricks.

615
01:27:49,513 --> 01:27:53,415
And Ali does it to me before
I can do it to him!

616
01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:55,678
And now Hassan takes his turn.

617
01:27:55,752 --> 01:27:58,050
This one trick at the expense
of the magician himself!

618
01:27:58,121 --> 01:28:01,113
So much for magic!

619
01:28:01,191 --> 01:28:08,290
You must be a dish! There's a whole
crowd of Romeos tailing you!

620
01:28:08,498 --> 01:28:13,492
Shameless! I'm old enough to be
your mother! So never mind the ass!

621
01:28:38,762 --> 01:28:42,198
She's pretty.

622
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:44,527
But not as pretty as you are!

623
01:28:51,174 --> 01:28:52,198
Shall we?

624
01:29:05,355 --> 01:29:06,481
Zeenat

625
01:29:11,995 --> 01:29:14,623
What are you waiting for,
Zeenat? Go inside.

626
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:28,503
Yes, my Princess?

627
01:29:28,578 --> 01:29:31,809
Give me a massage.
My back is aching.

628
01:29:42,626 --> 01:29:46,824
Your hand feeIs rough.

629
01:29:49,866 --> 01:29:53,529
The touch reminds me of someone.

630
01:29:53,603 --> 01:29:55,434
Who?

631
01:29:57,441 --> 01:30:06,679
He tell me, you're a goIden doll.
And he says, I'm a clay doll.

632
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:10,550
But he was so lively!

633
01:30:12,589 --> 01:30:15,956
If you don't meet him soon,
his spirits will be dashed.

634
01:30:17,327 --> 01:30:18,487
God forbid.

635
01:30:18,662 --> 01:30:19,720
Really?

636
01:30:38,548 --> 01:30:39,640
Goodness!

637
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,817
What's this chaos?

638
01:30:44,888 --> 01:30:47,118
What happened?

639
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:48,179
What's going on?

640
01:30:49,459 --> 01:30:50,448
Look!

641
01:30:50,527 --> 01:30:51,926
She's an impostor! Get her!

642
01:31:12,449 --> 01:31:14,974
Rukhsana!

643
01:31:21,825 --> 01:31:23,725
My Iove!

644
01:31:28,565 --> 01:31:32,399
The fairy from Hind!
You're mine!

645
01:31:32,469 --> 01:31:38,430
At Iast! You've come to me!

646
01:31:38,508 --> 01:31:43,707
You put me to shame, my Lord!
I was so eager to meet you!

647
01:31:43,814 --> 01:31:46,374
And I am your sIave!
Must you stand so far from me?

648
01:31:46,616 --> 01:31:47,981
Come into my arms!

649
01:31:52,556 --> 01:31:53,716
What means this?

650
01:31:54,424 --> 01:31:56,415
Don't you understand as much?

651
01:31:56,493 --> 01:32:00,122
I must freshen up before!

652
01:32:01,598 --> 01:32:02,895
The bath is over there.

653
01:32:03,033 --> 01:32:04,022
May I?

654
01:32:09,339 --> 01:32:10,328
Son-of-an-ass!

655
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:15,235
Give yourseIf a good rubbing.

656
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:19,139
This is my day of reckoning!

657
01:32:27,657 --> 01:32:29,682
My Iove!

658
01:32:29,759 --> 01:32:30,953
FIed!

659
01:33:51,308 --> 01:33:52,297
FooIs!

660
01:33:52,842 --> 01:33:53,934
Hussies!

661
01:33:54,044 --> 01:33:55,773
ImbeciIes!

662
01:33:55,845 --> 01:33:58,313
You can't do a thing!

663
01:33:58,381 --> 01:33:59,905
Do something!

664
01:33:59,983 --> 01:34:03,646
Get Hassan here! Dress him up
in your cIothes if you have to!

665
01:34:04,688 --> 01:34:08,180
Not to be anxious, my Princess.
Here I am.

666
01:34:11,795 --> 01:34:13,353
But that's Altaf's costume!

667
01:34:14,397 --> 01:34:15,864
The soldiers are after me!

668
01:34:18,234 --> 01:34:19,292
Let's run away!

669
01:34:19,369 --> 01:34:20,358
Come on!

670
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:55,222
For the rich, for the wealthy,
for Viziers, for Kings!

671
01:40:55,298 --> 01:40:58,233
She is made for the richest of them!

672
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:00,735
Who bids for her?

673
01:41:00,803 --> 01:41:05,172
- For this fairy from the Heavens!
- The fairest of them all!

674
01:41:05,241 --> 01:41:10,770
The one she goes to will enjoy
the pIeasures of The Heavens!

675
01:41:13,116 --> 01:41:15,949
500 dinars for the beauty.

676
01:41:19,789 --> 01:41:21,814
1000 dinars for the fairy!

677
01:41:23,259 --> 01:41:25,386
Buy your sisters with your dinars.

678
01:41:25,595 --> 01:41:26,823
Shut up, wench!

679
01:41:28,231 --> 01:41:32,497
Everyone on saIe here
is someone's sister!

680
01:41:32,568 --> 01:41:36,527
I'm not up for saIe.
Nor any of these others.

681
01:41:46,349 --> 01:41:50,308
1500 dinars!
For the fiery fairy!

682
01:41:51,254 --> 01:41:52,243
There she is.

683
01:41:52,388 --> 01:41:54,083
We are taking this wench away.

684
01:41:54,557 --> 01:41:57,617
She's a rebel. She has
escaped from custody.

685
01:41:57,693 --> 01:42:00,491
She belongs to Prince Altaf.

686
01:42:01,063 --> 01:42:02,052
Ajooba!

687
01:42:03,065 --> 01:42:05,158
Run! It's Ajooba!

688
01:42:45,065 --> 01:42:49,024
Are you going to leave all alone
in the middle of a forest?

689
01:42:51,071 --> 01:42:53,232
You have this penchant of
getting into trouble.

690
01:42:54,774 --> 01:42:57,038
But I haven't the time
to go on staging rescues.

691
01:43:04,217 --> 01:43:07,380
We'll see how far you
go away from me.

692
01:43:15,595 --> 01:43:19,087
Hey horse! You're all alone!
Where's your rider?

693
01:43:19,766 --> 01:43:21,063
He's running scared.

694
01:43:22,202 --> 01:43:23,692
He takes care not to turn up
where I am.

695
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:25,059
Who are you?

696
01:43:26,306 --> 01:43:29,298
Don't you know the story about
Ajooba running scared of Ali?

697
01:43:29,442 --> 01:43:36,814
I've heard about this Ali.
He's just a tin soldier.

698
01:43:41,054 --> 01:43:43,989
Aren't you scared in the forest?
What if a strange feIIow accosts you?

699
01:43:44,057 --> 01:43:45,354
Dare anyone touch me!

700
01:43:48,361 --> 01:43:49,726
Is that an invitation?
Or a threat?

701
01:43:49,796 --> 01:43:51,821
You can onIy know afterwards.

702
01:43:52,799 --> 01:43:57,736
I hear about fortune readers
from Hind.

703
01:43:58,104 --> 01:43:59,332
You heard it right.

704
01:44:01,208 --> 01:44:02,732
Can you read my paIm?

705
01:44:13,153 --> 01:44:14,142
What happened?

706
01:44:14,221 --> 01:44:17,213
Your luck is entwined
with my destiny.

707
01:44:17,657 --> 01:44:19,022
What do you mean?

708
01:48:56,336 --> 01:49:02,138
I ask him don't you have a heart?
He pulls a face and teIIs me, no!

709
01:49:02,208 --> 01:49:04,768
I ask him again: No!

710
01:49:04,844 --> 01:49:06,471
And I ask him again: No!

711
01:49:06,546 --> 01:49:08,514
Don't you have any feelings: No!

712
01:49:08,581 --> 01:49:11,607
Now look at him:
Something's happening to me, Ali!

713
01:49:12,919 --> 01:49:15,911
You know, for the first time
in your Iife...

714
01:49:15,989 --> 01:49:18,514
you've done something sensibIe.
And that's because I toId you.

715
01:49:18,591 --> 01:49:20,786
- Shut up.
- I toId you to find a girI.

716
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:23,829
- And you must marry her.
- Shut up!

717
01:49:23,897 --> 01:49:27,560
And you must make babies right away.

718
01:49:27,634 --> 01:49:28,623
Shut up!

719
01:49:29,235 --> 01:49:31,703
I'm teIIing you this.
You're going to marry her.

720
01:49:31,771 --> 01:49:33,602
- And afterwards...
- Just shut up.

721
01:49:35,542 --> 01:49:36,531
Father...

722
01:49:37,744 --> 01:49:40,110
This is Rukhsana.

723
01:49:42,048 --> 01:49:44,312
He doesn't understand.
You don't understand, do you?

724
01:49:44,384 --> 01:49:48,320
That's because he thinks you're
in Iove with your sword!

725
01:49:48,388 --> 01:49:52,586
Now he has found a scabbard
for his sword.

726
01:49:52,659 --> 01:49:55,526
I've convinced that he must
marry Rukhsana.

727
01:49:56,763 --> 01:49:59,129
I am gratefuI to The Lord!

728
01:49:59,399 --> 01:50:04,962
Thank me! I Iit the Iight of Iove
that shines in his wooden heart!

729
01:50:07,173 --> 01:50:08,663
Go on. You must teII your mother.

730
01:50:09,742 --> 01:50:10,731
Come in, my child.

731
01:50:12,045 --> 01:50:14,570
- And you rascal...
- Take it easy!

732
01:50:17,717 --> 01:50:21,278
I have brought a bride.
Her name is Rukhsana.

733
01:50:22,922 --> 01:50:28,485
If onIy I couId see Rukhsana!
For a moment!

734
01:50:31,097 --> 01:50:32,724
So what if you can't see her?

735
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:41,031
You can see her with your heart.

736
01:50:46,813 --> 01:50:48,508
May Allah protect you from evil.

737
01:50:50,216 --> 01:50:51,513
Such a lovable girl!

738
01:50:52,752 --> 01:50:54,379
May Allah make the two of you happy.

739
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:58,416
You will make my Ali very happy!

740
01:50:58,491 --> 01:51:01,051
And everyone in the world will be
jeaIous of the two of you.

741
01:51:06,766 --> 01:51:09,667
AItaf, are you sure Rukhsana
has traveled this way?

742
01:51:09,736 --> 01:51:12,296
Absolutely. My spies
are always right.

743
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:21,969
Get them!

744
01:51:22,849 --> 01:51:24,282
Surround them!

745
01:51:25,385 --> 01:51:29,583
We must capture Ali
and his friends.

746
01:51:41,868 --> 01:51:43,426
Get Rukhsana!

747
01:53:23,269 --> 01:53:24,463
Stop!

748
01:53:24,937 --> 01:53:26,632
EIse the woman dies!

749
01:53:27,573 --> 01:53:33,512
I'm going to cut her neck!

750
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:35,677
Drop your weapons!

751
01:53:36,382 --> 01:53:38,907
No Ali! Don't!

752
01:53:38,985 --> 01:53:41,317
Don't listen to him! Don't!

753
01:53:41,387 --> 01:53:45,517
There's very little time left.
Turn yourself in.

754
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:47,923
Else, I'll hack her to pieces!

755
01:53:56,469 --> 01:54:00,963
For the sake of their mothers
a hundred Alis could die.

756
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:06,911
My prophet Ali commands me to.
I surrender.

757
01:54:09,482 --> 01:54:10,972
Take this traitor away.

758
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:14,247
And Rukhsana goes to my boudoir.

759
01:54:15,354 --> 01:54:16,719
Have Rukhsana presented to me.

760
01:54:17,824 --> 01:54:19,724
Has Rukhsana something
that I don't possess?

761
01:54:22,094 --> 01:54:27,555
You are the grape which has been
juiced dry.

762
01:54:27,633 --> 01:54:31,763
Rukhsana is fresh fruit.

763
01:54:31,838 --> 01:54:35,239
Every pod fuII of juice!

764
01:54:35,308 --> 01:54:37,902
Bring her.

765
01:54:37,977 --> 01:54:38,966
Go on.

766
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,609
Rukhsana is here, my Lord.

767
01:54:42,682 --> 01:54:47,016
Rukhsana, if only you had acquiesced
if onIy you came to my bed...

768
01:54:47,086 --> 01:54:54,891
you wouldn't be wearing
these rags.

769
01:54:54,961 --> 01:54:57,191
I would've made you a princess!

770
01:54:57,263 --> 01:54:59,891
But you preferred to become
Ali's slave?

771
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:04,169
Altaf, you do not compare with Ali.

772
01:55:04,237 --> 01:55:08,196
I am his slave. And I will be his
all my life.

773
01:55:08,441 --> 01:55:09,430
Tart!

774
01:55:09,609 --> 01:55:11,201
HoId your hand!

775
01:55:11,277 --> 01:55:13,108
I am the tigress from Hind.

776
01:55:13,179 --> 01:55:17,479
One swipe with my cIaws, and
your arm will be ripped out!

777
01:55:19,218 --> 01:55:20,776
The killer instinct
is so appealing!

778
01:55:22,555 --> 01:55:24,785
Come my tigress, rip me apart.

779
01:55:26,359 --> 01:55:28,554
That's just what I want.

780
01:55:29,762 --> 01:55:31,855
The tigress doesn't
hunt the dead.

781
01:55:32,498 --> 01:55:39,870
Get out of here! But don't you think
for a moment that Ali will come...

782
01:55:39,939 --> 01:55:46,208
to save you. He has gone to a pIace
from where no one has ever returned.

783
01:55:48,614 --> 01:55:49,603
Take her away.

784
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:52,439
Come.

785
01:56:17,076 --> 01:56:18,065
Mother!

786
01:56:28,754 --> 01:56:36,024
I cannot bear it any Ionger.
My Iife is over. Let me pass.

787
01:56:36,095 --> 01:56:38,029
FareweII.

788
01:56:38,097 --> 01:56:39,394
Take care of yourseIf.

789
01:56:42,301 --> 01:56:45,862
No! Have courage, Mother!

790
01:56:49,241 --> 01:56:51,436
Please Mother! For my sake!
Don't give up hope!

791
01:56:52,812 --> 01:56:53,870
Mother!

792
01:57:24,043 --> 01:57:26,170
How did this happen?

793
01:57:26,245 --> 01:57:27,405
The chain is severed!

794
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:48,026
Who sent this creature here?

795
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,741
Greetings, Anwar Khan.

796
01:58:35,815 --> 01:58:37,942
Greetings, Prince Udham Singh.

797
01:58:38,017 --> 01:58:41,009
I am Pleased. Please accept
my greetings.

798
01:58:41,087 --> 01:58:43,021
My obeisances to the Sultan-e-Ali.

799
01:58:43,089 --> 01:58:45,990
My father, Maharaja Karan Singh
send you greetings.

800
01:58:46,892 --> 01:58:50,760
Your Majesty, Prince AItaf has
aIready spoken to you about this.

801
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:53,993
Prince Udham Singh prays for
Princess Heena's hand in marriage.

802
01:58:55,534 --> 01:58:58,059
I will consider your prayer.

803
01:58:58,838 --> 01:59:03,502
Hassan, you're a Ioser.
Your Henna is going to that Prince.

804
01:59:05,044 --> 01:59:06,568
Now that isn't about to happen.

805
01:59:06,645 --> 01:59:09,409
We'II smuggIe Rukhsana and Henna
out of the castIe.

806
01:59:10,583 --> 01:59:11,811
You see the opposition?

807
01:59:11,884 --> 01:59:14,910
No probIem. We'II fIy in.

808
01:59:14,987 --> 01:59:16,352
How?

809
01:59:18,591 --> 01:59:19,683
I'll show you.

810
01:59:22,394 --> 01:59:28,026
I have a potion. It scaIes
you down and then up again.

811
01:59:29,468 --> 01:59:31,333
Why my neck?

812
01:59:31,403 --> 01:59:34,031
Let me show you.

813
01:59:36,942 --> 01:59:37,931
Say what?

814
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:39,978
We're smaII now.
But we aren't yet in.

815
01:59:40,146 --> 01:59:41,135
No probIem.

816
01:59:45,151 --> 01:59:48,416
Use your sIing-shot.
CatapuIt us in there.

817
01:59:51,223 --> 01:59:52,212
Right!

818
01:59:52,324 --> 01:59:53,586
CarefuI now.

819
01:59:55,194 --> 01:59:57,059
CarefuI!

820
01:59:57,429 --> 01:59:59,329
Now don't you miss.

821
01:59:59,431 --> 02:00:01,262
EIse we'II land eIsewhere!

822
02:00:03,969 --> 02:00:05,266
CarefuI with my bones!

823
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:11,034
Shah Rukh, escort the guests
to their quarters.

824
02:00:11,110 --> 02:00:12,099
WeIcome, Prince.

825
02:00:12,311 --> 02:00:15,439
We have a gypsy girI from Hind
to entertain you.

826
02:00:15,514 --> 02:00:16,503
I am very Pleased.

827
02:00:19,318 --> 02:00:23,311
Rukhsana, I know everything
about you.

828
02:00:23,389 --> 02:00:27,348
Are Hassan and Ali prisoners
in this castIe?

829
02:00:28,394 --> 02:00:30,862
No. AItaf has sent them
to their deaths.

830
02:00:32,198 --> 02:00:35,895
Not even death
can part Iovers.

831
02:00:39,338 --> 02:00:43,399
If anything happens to Hassan,
I'll kill myseIf.

832
02:00:44,143 --> 02:00:49,080
And I thought Iove bIossomed
onIy in Hind.

833
02:00:49,148 --> 02:00:53,107
Now I see that the fragrance
has wafted into Bahrestan.

834
02:00:53,719 --> 02:00:56,279
I am very Pleased
with your cordiaIity.

835
02:00:56,355 --> 02:00:59,017
The reception was grand.

836
02:00:59,091 --> 02:01:01,150
I am sure the wedding
will be grander.

837
02:01:01,227 --> 02:01:02,216
Why not?

838
02:01:02,428 --> 02:01:05,488
Henna, meet Prince Udham Singh.

839
02:01:06,832 --> 02:01:08,925
I toId you!

840
02:01:13,172 --> 02:01:15,436
Say you accept it!

841
02:01:15,507 --> 02:01:17,134
I accept.

842
02:01:19,178 --> 02:01:20,736
I am very Pleased!

843
02:01:20,913 --> 02:01:21,937
Me too.

844
02:01:23,515 --> 02:01:29,044
Rukhsana, I'm sure you'II entertain
these guests from your country.

845
02:01:29,688 --> 02:01:32,452
No matter where they are from,
I won't dance for them.

846
02:01:45,004 --> 02:01:47,939
I will dance. For the sake
of the man I Iove.

847
02:04:39,311 --> 02:04:41,609
My compIiments.
You sing very weII.

848
02:04:42,581 --> 02:04:44,310
But I thought you were singing.

849
02:04:44,383 --> 02:04:48,251
No. I wasn't singing.
Must've been Anwar.

850
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,447
Strange! Back home in Hind,
he had a horribIe voice.

851
02:04:50,522 --> 02:04:52,683
As soon as he comes here, he begins
singing Iike a nightingaIe!

852
02:07:32,951 --> 02:07:33,940
Get out.

853
02:07:34,553 --> 02:07:38,512
You're meant to entertain.

854
02:07:38,624 --> 02:07:40,888
If you make AItaf happy...

855
02:07:40,959 --> 02:07:41,948
Never!

856
02:07:42,427 --> 02:07:45,419
Take her away!
To the dungeons.

857
02:07:49,067 --> 02:07:51,194
May I take your Ieave now?

858
02:07:51,303 --> 02:07:53,237
So when do we get married?

859
02:07:53,305 --> 02:07:55,671
All in good time, Your Majesty.

860
02:07:55,741 --> 02:07:57,709
I'm just a prince now.

861
02:07:57,776 --> 02:07:59,437
- What are you doing?
- Yes?

862
02:07:59,511 --> 02:08:03,447
I want you to become the king
as soon as you can.

863
02:08:03,515 --> 02:08:05,312
I want to become your queen.

864
02:08:05,384 --> 02:08:06,908
I am Pleased to hear that.

865
02:08:06,985 --> 02:08:09,920
But I can't become the king
as Iong as my father is alive.

866
02:08:09,988 --> 02:08:16,655
But now that you teII me about it,
Iife is but fIeeting.

867
02:08:21,533 --> 02:08:24,900
If you step out of here,
the tiger will eat you.

868
02:08:34,946 --> 02:08:37,574
Hey! Don't you dare touch
my Rukhsana!

869
02:08:43,922 --> 02:08:45,253
So Iarge a cup!

870
02:08:47,559 --> 02:08:51,586
No. That can't be a cup.
Must be a huge cask of wine!

871
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:57,596
Why do I feeI so smaII?

872
02:09:00,072 --> 02:09:01,061
Who am I?

873
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,900
Oh yes! I'm Ali!

874
02:09:05,343 --> 02:09:06,605
What am I doing here?

875
02:09:09,047 --> 02:09:11,914
I came here to sneak Rukhsana out.

876
02:09:11,983 --> 02:09:13,951
And Iook at me now.
Aching with a hangover!

877
02:09:15,921 --> 02:09:16,910
BIoody drunk!

878
02:09:16,988 --> 02:09:18,615
Now move it!

879
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:21,384
But where to?

880
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:23,018
Somewhere! Anywhere!

881
02:09:47,753 --> 02:09:50,745
WeII my friend, what
were you saying?

882
02:09:59,631 --> 02:10:01,929
My daughter! In Bahrestan?

883
02:10:04,002 --> 02:10:05,162
Where?

884
02:10:13,812 --> 02:10:16,781
Go away. I won't Iisten to you.

885
02:10:16,848 --> 02:10:19,681
My man is Iying dead drunk.

886
02:10:19,885 --> 02:10:22,581
And here you are, chattering away!

887
02:10:22,654 --> 02:10:24,281
No! I toId you!

888
02:10:27,025 --> 02:10:28,014
What?

889
02:10:31,329 --> 02:10:32,660
What did you say?

890
02:10:32,731 --> 02:10:35,700
My father? Where's my father?

891
02:10:39,137 --> 02:10:40,695
In the ceII next door?

892
02:10:42,674 --> 02:10:44,107
You're teIIing me the truth,
aren't you?

893
02:10:55,754 --> 02:10:57,654
I'm your daughter!

894
02:10:57,722 --> 02:11:00,589
I'm Rukhsana! I'm your daughter!

895
02:11:01,626 --> 02:11:03,218
Rukhsana? My daughter?

896
02:11:05,564 --> 02:11:07,225
How did you come here?

897
02:11:07,833 --> 02:11:09,300
I came Iooking for you.

898
02:11:10,936 --> 02:11:13,928
Your Iife is in danger!

899
02:11:14,773 --> 02:11:17,207
If in trying to take you back
to my mother, I die...

900
02:11:17,275 --> 02:11:20,733
then this Iife will
have been weII-spent.

901
02:11:25,116 --> 02:11:29,246
How is your mother?

902
02:11:33,859 --> 02:11:40,492
For 20 years, she has lived
a miserabIe Iife!

903
02:11:41,466 --> 02:11:48,770
But for these waIIs that hoId me,
I wouId've been with you!

904
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:52,906
You were a newborn
when I saw you Iast.

905
02:11:52,978 --> 02:11:57,415
And every day for aII these years,
I have pined for you.

906
02:11:57,482 --> 02:12:01,782
And now you're so cIose to me!
But I cannot see you!

907
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:06,714
Do not despair. The Lord
will work a miracIe for us.

908
02:12:06,791 --> 02:12:08,782
We will get back the years
we have lost.

909
02:13:57,869 --> 02:13:58,893
Rukhsana! My chiId!

910
02:14:07,412 --> 02:14:09,380
This is Ajooba. The rebeI.

911
02:14:15,453 --> 02:14:21,449
Yes! You must be the one!

912
02:14:21,526 --> 02:14:23,460
The chiId I dreamt of
aII these years!

913
02:14:24,963 --> 02:14:28,296
The future of Bahrestan!

914
02:14:29,467 --> 02:14:30,832
Hurry!

915
02:14:30,902 --> 02:14:33,166
EIse this happiness
will be short-lived.

916
02:14:46,785 --> 02:14:47,774
Ali! Stop!

917
02:14:51,322 --> 02:14:53,085
Down here!

918
02:14:53,258 --> 02:14:55,089
Look down.

919
02:14:56,528 --> 02:14:57,756
Yes... here.

920
02:15:00,265 --> 02:15:01,823
- Hassan! You?
- Yes!

921
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:04,801
You're back to your oId seIf.
And you've Ieft me stunted!

922
02:15:04,869 --> 02:15:06,200
Make me taII.

923
02:15:06,271 --> 02:15:07,670
But that's up to God!

924
02:15:07,739 --> 02:15:09,969
But the potion is with you.

925
02:15:11,009 --> 02:15:11,998
Oh yes!

926
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:22,181
Guess what'd happen to me
if we ran out of stock!

927
02:15:26,324 --> 02:15:28,656
Enough!

928
02:15:34,365 --> 02:15:35,696
You're towering over me!

929
02:15:36,935 --> 02:15:39,563
Nice view from the top.

930
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:45,976
If you don't get back
to your oId seIf...

931
02:15:46,044 --> 02:15:49,172
Henna might take me for you!
I'd be gIad.

932
02:15:49,247 --> 02:15:52,011
No! Use the potion.

933
02:15:58,923 --> 02:16:01,084
Here I am. Back to normaI!

934
02:16:05,897 --> 02:16:11,494
They aren't back yet.
I hope they aren't in troubIe.

935
02:16:12,504 --> 02:16:13,835
Here they are.

936
02:16:16,508 --> 02:16:17,497
Thank God.

937
02:16:23,348 --> 02:16:25,248
This is Amir Khan.

938
02:16:25,316 --> 02:16:28,877
- I have heard of him. The Vizier...
- He imprisoned me on faIse charges.

939
02:16:29,053 --> 02:16:35,720
Now after aII these years,
thanks to Ali, I'm free.

940
02:16:36,895 --> 02:16:41,059
Mother will be so happy when
she hears that I've succeeded!

941
02:16:41,866 --> 02:16:45,802
I wish I had my ring.
The magician stoIe it from me.

942
02:16:47,105 --> 02:16:48,834
I couId've seen my wife.

943
02:16:57,415 --> 02:16:58,746
Is this the ring?

944
02:16:59,784 --> 02:17:02,446
I took it from him when
I turned him into an ass.

945
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:04,920
Yes! This is the ring!

946
02:17:05,356 --> 02:17:08,086
The ass is here too.

947
02:17:11,529 --> 02:17:14,589
Watch the magic of this ring.

948
02:17:31,749 --> 02:17:33,341
My Zarina is in a bad shape!

949
02:17:42,093 --> 02:17:44,391
Who is this man?

950
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:50,129
He's the medicine man.
He works cures for the iII.

951
02:18:07,285 --> 02:18:11,312
A miracIe! He possesses
a great power!

952
02:18:13,958 --> 02:18:15,425
But that's the Sultan!

953
02:18:15,593 --> 02:18:16,582
What?

954
02:18:17,262 --> 02:18:19,162
What are you saying?

955
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:21,660
The Sultan of Bahrestan?

956
02:18:22,066 --> 02:18:24,432
Yes! The Sultan! My friend!

957
02:18:24,869 --> 02:18:27,497
The Sultan of Bahrestan! Alive?

958
02:18:28,606 --> 02:18:29,971
The Sultan!

959
02:18:30,041 --> 02:18:31,030
My husband!

960
02:18:31,376 --> 02:18:33,571
Did you say he's alive?

961
02:18:35,079 --> 02:18:38,071
He's stiII alive?! ReaIIy?

962
02:18:48,092 --> 02:18:50,822
What a strange twist of destiny!

963
02:18:50,895 --> 02:18:53,329
The Queen of Bahrestan was
begging on the streets!

964
02:18:56,234 --> 02:19:00,034
CompIain not. Thank The Lord.
For two miracIes.

965
02:19:00,104 --> 02:19:02,766
The Sultan is alive.
And our Queen too.

966
02:19:07,512 --> 02:19:12,711
Your Majesty, why didn't you say
you're the Queen of Bahrestan?

967
02:19:15,253 --> 02:19:21,852
As of now, I am a common woman.
And what's a queen without the king?

968
02:19:21,926 --> 02:19:24,986
I am so far from him!

969
02:19:25,063 --> 02:19:28,965
He's alive! And I can't see him!

970
02:19:31,803 --> 02:19:37,867
Do not despair. So what
if you don't have eyes?

971
02:19:37,942 --> 02:19:40,240
I'll teII you what he Iooks Iike.

972
02:19:48,386 --> 02:19:55,019
See Mother, he wears a white robe.

973
02:19:55,093 --> 02:19:59,427
His face is agIow
with kindred spirit.

974
02:19:59,530 --> 02:20:01,521
And his eyes shine
with a divine power.

975
02:20:04,268 --> 02:20:07,601
He cures the sick with
a touch of his hand.

976
02:20:08,539 --> 02:20:14,171
Joy and sorrow are both gifts
from The Lord.

977
02:20:14,245 --> 02:20:18,545
ReveI in your joys.
Accept your sorrows.

978
02:20:20,184 --> 02:20:24,280
As if the Messiah
has been born again.

979
02:20:25,823 --> 02:20:31,056
Yes. That is my Sultan.
My husband.

980
02:20:31,662 --> 02:20:35,120
We must traveI to Hind.
We must bring the Sultan back.

981
02:20:36,634 --> 02:20:40,468
But he remembers nothing.
He has forgotten his past.

982
02:20:44,008 --> 02:20:47,239
Give him this eIephant.

983
02:20:47,311 --> 02:20:50,474
This is the Iast memento
of our onIy son.

984
02:20:50,548 --> 02:20:56,316
He will remember everything
as soon as he sees this.

985
02:21:04,829 --> 02:21:12,964
The Sultan has hidden the key
to the Satan cast in iron.

986
02:21:13,037 --> 02:21:14,664
He is the onIy one
who knows about it.

987
02:21:15,773 --> 02:21:20,472
Make sure you teII the Sultan
not to reveaI the secret.

988
02:21:23,247 --> 02:21:26,011
My chance to break free!

989
02:21:28,186 --> 02:21:31,349
MiIes to go before I sIeep!

990
02:21:33,458 --> 02:21:36,188
Stop chasing me.

991
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:38,023
Stop crowding around me.

992
02:21:38,663 --> 02:21:43,123
I have to sneak into the castIe
on the sIy.

993
02:21:47,205 --> 02:21:52,165
Now where's the potion that
will change me back to human?

994
02:21:52,243 --> 02:21:56,009
That's for the dog.
No. I don't want that.

995
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:59,140
That's for the frog... no.

996
02:21:59,217 --> 02:22:00,912
Where's the thing for men?
Here it is!

997
02:22:04,922 --> 02:22:11,384
The Sultan will reward me
when I teII him aII the news!

998
02:22:45,263 --> 02:22:48,528
Why don't you stand
on your feet?

999
02:22:48,966 --> 02:22:53,528
I've been an ass
for sometime now.

1000
02:22:53,604 --> 02:22:56,437
Weren't you supposed to have
made an ass out of Ajooba?

1001
02:22:56,807 --> 02:23:02,370
But that Ali, the innkeeper,
he turned me into an ass!

1002
02:23:07,752 --> 02:23:08,776
TaIk business.

1003
02:23:08,886 --> 02:23:10,376
Bad news.

1004
02:23:10,454 --> 02:23:14,515
Ali has fIed with
Amir Khan and Rukhsana.

1005
02:23:14,692 --> 02:23:15,681
What?!

1006
02:23:17,361 --> 02:23:23,322
Amir Khan Iooked in his magic ring
and said that the Sultan is alive.

1007
02:23:23,401 --> 02:23:25,028
He's in Karanpur. In Hind.

1008
02:23:25,503 --> 02:23:29,633
And he has the key to
the Satan cast in iron.

1009
02:23:29,707 --> 02:23:30,696
ImbeciIe!

1010
02:23:35,112 --> 02:23:40,277
And the bIind beggar is
the Queen of Bahrestan!

1011
02:23:40,351 --> 02:23:45,050
Ali and his gang have gone to Hind.
To bring the Sultan back.

1012
02:23:46,023 --> 02:23:49,720
But you killed aII of them!

1013
02:23:49,794 --> 02:23:52,058
And now they're springing
back to Iife!

1014
02:23:52,129 --> 02:23:53,596
The prince! CouId he be alive?

1015
02:23:53,864 --> 02:23:55,593
The Lord preserve the prince.

1016
02:23:56,467 --> 02:23:59,061
You mustn't speak Iike that
before your father.

1017
02:23:59,236 --> 02:24:04,071
I can see through that facade.

1018
02:24:05,476 --> 02:24:10,379
And I aIso see through this charade.

1019
02:24:10,648 --> 02:24:11,637
SiIence!

1020
02:24:11,949 --> 02:24:14,975
I never beIieved
what peopIe say.

1021
02:24:15,052 --> 02:24:19,352
But now I know the truth.
And I'm ashamed!

1022
02:24:19,423 --> 02:24:21,015
How I wish I weren't
your daughter.

1023
02:24:24,829 --> 02:24:27,957
Your daughter is just as impetuous!

1024
02:24:31,302 --> 02:24:34,328
Had you not been
my wife's brother...

1025
02:24:34,405 --> 02:24:36,839
you wouId've been no more
than a foot soldier.

1026
02:24:36,907 --> 02:24:40,638
Think of something!

1027
02:24:40,711 --> 02:24:43,578
I've thought it over. Let AItaf
fIy the magic carpet to Hind.

1028
02:24:43,648 --> 02:24:45,513
Udham Singh is his friend.
If he heIps...

1029
02:24:45,583 --> 02:24:47,778
it won't be difficuIt
to kill the Sultan.

1030
02:24:48,819 --> 02:24:51,947
AItaf! Go!

1031
02:24:53,724 --> 02:25:00,721
kill the Sultan. And get
the key to the Satan.

1032
02:25:01,799 --> 02:25:02,788
As you wish.

1033
02:25:04,502 --> 02:25:06,766
Long live The Satan!

1034
02:25:17,581 --> 02:25:19,242
You must get out of here!

1035
02:25:19,483 --> 02:25:23,419
The magician has toId my father that
you're going to get the Sultan back.

1036
02:25:30,561 --> 02:25:33,325
Please take care of
the Queen and Amir Khan.

1037
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:45,839
The Lord protect your passage.

1038
02:25:51,148 --> 02:25:54,811
You've wept your share of tears.

1039
02:25:57,488 --> 02:26:00,013
For the Iast time,
I'll wipe your tears.

1040
02:26:01,992 --> 02:26:12,527
I will stake my Iife and souI to
bring back The Sultan of Bahrestan.

1041
02:26:14,905 --> 02:26:17,874
And I will see you smiIe
once again. I promise.

1042
02:26:49,507 --> 02:26:53,341
You want me to kill
the medicine man? Very weII.

1043
02:26:55,446 --> 02:27:01,817
He's no simpIe medicine man.
He's the Sultan of Bahrestan.

1044
02:27:03,053 --> 02:27:08,821
Something teIIs me that my father
is going to die too.

1045
02:27:11,128 --> 02:27:14,689
Looks Iike my father's death
is the reason why you are here.

1046
02:27:20,070 --> 02:27:23,699
- Maharaja Karan Singh, you mean?
- Hush. Come near.

1047
02:27:24,975 --> 02:27:30,174
I too have a fancy for the throne.
But I can't kill my father.

1048
02:27:30,247 --> 02:27:31,714
The subjects will revoIt.

1049
02:27:33,050 --> 02:27:37,510
So you do me a favor.
And I'll do you a favor.

1050
02:27:37,588 --> 02:27:41,649
You will never get to know
where the medicine man lives.

1051
02:27:44,094 --> 02:27:46,528
The dance is about to concIude.

1052
02:27:48,232 --> 02:27:50,530
You shouId arrive
at a concIusion too.

1053
02:27:50,601 --> 02:27:51,625
AII right.

1054
02:27:51,702 --> 02:27:52,828
I am Pleased.

1055
02:28:08,986 --> 02:28:11,011
AItaf, this is the medicine man.

1056
02:28:11,188 --> 02:28:12,314
Arrest him.

1057
02:28:15,125 --> 02:28:18,117
- You know everything.
- I know nothing.

1058
02:28:18,195 --> 02:28:20,390
- Where is the key?
- Don't risk your Iife!

1059
02:28:20,464 --> 02:28:23,194
Speak up! EIse, you will
be hacked to pieces!

1060
02:28:23,267 --> 02:28:24,996
I know nothing.

1061
02:28:34,478 --> 02:28:36,002
HeIp me!

1062
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:37,877
Please move this stone.

1063
02:28:51,028 --> 02:28:52,495
You must be Zarina.

1064
02:28:52,563 --> 02:28:53,894
Yes. Who are you?

1065
02:28:54,331 --> 02:28:56,026
I've come from Bahrestan.

1066
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:58,034
To take you and my Sultan back.

1067
02:28:58,535 --> 02:29:00,696
But Udham Singh has Iocked him up
in the cave.

1068
02:29:01,005 --> 02:29:02,199
We'II get him out.

1069
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:04,000
Come my friend.

1070
02:29:05,242 --> 02:29:06,903
HeIp me do a good deed.

1071
02:30:48,212 --> 02:30:50,646
The key! Where is it?

1072
02:30:50,714 --> 02:30:52,909
Speak! EIse this bIade
goes through your heart!

1073
02:31:15,472 --> 02:31:17,736
Your Majesty, I've come to
take you back to Bahrestan.

1074
02:31:23,313 --> 02:31:26,373
These men aIso addressed me
as the Sultan.

1075
02:31:26,450 --> 02:31:31,353
And now you say the same.
But I don't understand...

1076
02:31:31,422 --> 02:31:34,949
I remember nothing about myseIf.

1077
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:39,388
Who am I?

1078
02:31:40,397 --> 02:31:44,527
Sultan-e-Ali, Please try to recaII.

1079
02:31:50,774 --> 02:31:51,763
See this?

1080
02:31:53,343 --> 02:31:54,833
Your Queen sends you this.

1081
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:59,110
She said you'II remember everything
once you see this.

1082
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:12,419
Try to remember. Your Queen.
She sat on the throne with you.

1083
02:32:12,496 --> 02:32:18,366
Your son. You were so happy
the day he was born.

1084
02:32:18,435 --> 02:32:20,335
And aII of Bahrestan ceIebrated
the chiIdbirth.

1085
02:32:22,039 --> 02:32:27,204
Remember the Vizier?
He poisoned your Iife!

1086
02:32:27,277 --> 02:32:31,213
He took you wife and your son
away from you! Remember?

1087
02:32:42,860 --> 02:32:43,849
Yes!

1088
02:32:46,563 --> 02:32:47,552
I remember!

1089
02:32:49,266 --> 02:32:50,255
Bahrestan!

1090
02:32:52,002 --> 02:32:56,336
That night in the boat!

1091
02:32:56,406 --> 02:32:59,705
My Queen! My Prince!

1092
02:33:01,645 --> 02:33:03,510
Where is my Prince?

1093
02:33:03,580 --> 02:33:05,241
Where is he?

1094
02:33:06,016 --> 02:33:07,711
No one knows anything about him.

1095
02:33:09,386 --> 02:33:16,053
He must have perished in the sea!

1096
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,161
This is no time to mourn.

1097
02:33:25,235 --> 02:33:26,634
Now is the time to
take your revenge.

1098
02:33:30,307 --> 02:33:31,296
Yes!

1099
02:33:32,109 --> 02:33:38,241
I will avenge my son!
I will kill the Vizier's son!

1100
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:45,754
But the Vizier is trying to bring
to Iife that Satan cast in iron.

1101
02:33:46,323 --> 02:33:54,287
He can't do it. The key is hidden in
the piIIar on the Ieft of my throne.

1102
02:33:56,800 --> 02:33:58,199
No one can find it.

1103
02:34:21,658 --> 02:34:24,593
What have you done, Your Majesty?
killed your son?

1104
02:34:24,661 --> 02:34:32,864
killed a traitor.
He was a bIot on Hind.

1105
02:34:33,470 --> 02:34:36,371
You killed your son for the sake
of our Sultan!

1106
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:39,341
For the peopIe of Hind, the guest
occupies the pIace of God.

1107
02:34:39,409 --> 02:34:41,138
- Sultan!
- Karan Singh!

1108
02:34:41,578 --> 02:34:42,977
My friend!

1109
02:34:59,863 --> 02:35:02,832
Ajooba and The Sultan are here!
They are flying a gondola!

1110
02:35:06,103 --> 02:35:08,162
My obeisances, Sultan-e-Ali!

1111
02:35:09,106 --> 02:35:11,165
I am fortunate to have met you.

1112
02:35:12,109 --> 02:35:15,567
Fortitude, my chiIdren!

1113
02:35:15,646 --> 02:35:20,549
Your Sultan has found
a loyal friend in Ajooba.

1114
02:35:20,617 --> 02:35:24,644
The Vizier will pay for your tears
in bIood!

1115
02:35:24,721 --> 02:35:28,179
From this day, Ajooba is my GeneraI.

1116
02:35:30,127 --> 02:35:31,788
Take over, General Ajooba.

1117
02:35:33,563 --> 02:35:37,192
To reinstate The Sultan...

1118
02:35:37,267 --> 02:35:39,292
I decIare the war for independence!

1119
02:35:39,403 --> 02:35:44,841
Long live The Sultan!

1120
02:35:45,809 --> 02:35:49,677
I couIdn't kill The Sultan.

1121
02:35:49,746 --> 02:35:54,240
Ajooba can attack us any moment.
The Sultan is with him.

1122
02:35:54,318 --> 02:35:55,478
We must be aIert.

1123
02:35:57,554 --> 02:35:59,920
And the key?

1124
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:02,015
I have it.

1125
02:36:07,431 --> 02:36:08,420
No! Not yet!

1126
02:36:15,605 --> 02:36:16,594
Fantastic!

1127
02:36:18,141 --> 02:36:20,701
Now I'll use the Satan cast in iron!

1128
02:36:21,111 --> 02:36:25,309
I'll vanquish The Sultan!
I'll rule the worId!

1129
02:36:29,953 --> 02:36:31,648
Long live The Satan!

1130
02:36:37,461 --> 02:36:40,430
The Queen sends you a taIisman.

1131
02:36:42,499 --> 02:36:43,659
Thank her for me.

1132
02:36:44,901 --> 02:36:49,031
TeII her that we were separated
when I lost a fight.

1133
02:36:49,106 --> 02:36:51,939
TeII her that I will see her
once I am victorious.

1134
02:36:52,008 --> 02:36:59,005
TeII her that tiII
the Vizier is dead...

1135
02:36:59,082 --> 02:37:01,050
I will not drink as much
as a drop of water!

1136
02:37:02,686 --> 02:37:07,521
Then I shaII drink water onIy after
my Sultan has been victorious.

1137
02:37:07,591 --> 02:37:12,221
Lord! Please do not let him
go thirsty for Iong.

1138
02:37:12,295 --> 02:37:13,694
Grant him a quick victory, Lord!

1139
02:37:30,614 --> 02:37:32,980
Long live The Satan!

1140
02:37:45,162 --> 02:37:47,756
The day has come to fight for
the independence of my country.

1141
02:37:50,634 --> 02:37:54,764
The day is come to slay The Satan
and bring everlasting peace.

1142
02:37:57,107 --> 02:37:58,335
Pray for me, my Mother.

1143
02:37:59,810 --> 02:38:03,473
Pray that injustice be dispeIIed;
the shackles of bondage be torn...

1144
02:38:03,547 --> 02:38:08,678
and may The Sultan ascend the
throne of Bahrestan once again.

1145
02:38:08,752 --> 02:38:13,746
May he bring prosperity
to the land.

1146
02:38:15,592 --> 02:38:16,786
Pray for us, my Mother.

1147
02:38:31,675 --> 02:38:32,664
Amen!

1148
02:38:34,578 --> 02:38:35,772
Amen.

1149
02:41:27,651 --> 02:41:32,384
Had you not been the wife's brother,
you'd be no more than a foot soldier.

1150
02:41:32,989 --> 02:41:33,978
Take that.

1151
02:42:28,311 --> 02:42:30,404
I present the criminal of Bahrestan.

1152
02:42:31,114 --> 02:42:35,278
Punish him with your own hands.

1153
02:42:38,722 --> 02:42:39,780
We have won!

1154
02:42:45,929 --> 02:42:48,420
Long live The Sultan!

1155
02:43:28,438 --> 02:43:37,676
Long live The Satan!

1156
02:43:50,660 --> 02:43:53,128
You have won, my Lord.

1157
02:43:53,196 --> 02:43:54,595
Please drink some water.

1158
02:44:35,872 --> 02:44:36,861
God bless you.

1159
02:45:06,836 --> 02:45:07,894
WeII done, Ajooba!

1160
02:45:07,971 --> 02:45:09,438
Long live Ajooba!

1161
02:45:10,106 --> 02:45:15,669
You killed the eviI Vizier
and his men!

1162
02:45:15,745 --> 02:45:17,110
Men will remember you forever!

1163
02:45:18,514 --> 02:45:21,449
Long live The Satan!

1164
02:47:00,316 --> 02:47:02,784
Long live The Satan!

1165
02:47:03,653 --> 02:47:08,181
No matter how powerfuI man becomes
he will always be weaker than Satan!

1166
02:47:09,993 --> 02:47:15,898
Ajooba! Now save your Sultan
if you can!

1167
02:47:51,934 --> 02:47:55,028
BIind him!

1168
02:48:29,005 --> 02:48:30,973
No one moves.

1169
02:48:51,360 --> 02:48:52,349
Bravo!

1170
02:49:28,197 --> 02:49:30,028
Long live The Satan!

1171
02:50:33,663 --> 02:50:35,096
Let the sword Iie there.

1172
02:50:37,266 --> 02:50:39,359
Someday, my son will draw it.

1173
02:50:54,817 --> 02:50:56,182
Ajooba is the prince!

1174
02:50:56,819 --> 02:50:57,808
The prince!

1175
02:51:21,244 --> 02:51:26,807
My father's sword
rises in revenge!

1176
02:52:59,342 --> 02:53:03,904
The Vizier won't die tiII
he is wearing the neckIace!

1177
02:54:12,848 --> 02:54:16,477
No Ali! You mustn't Ieave us!

1178
02:54:18,454 --> 02:54:20,479
You have won!

1179
02:54:20,556 --> 02:54:22,183
Now don't Iose out!

1180
02:54:23,826 --> 02:54:27,318
For the sake of your friend!
Don't Ieave your friend, Ali!

1181
02:54:28,297 --> 02:54:31,323
Lord! Save my son!

1182
02:54:32,935 --> 02:54:40,740
My son! I pined for him aII my Iife!
Lord! Am I now to hoId him dead?

1183
02:54:40,810 --> 02:54:48,683
Give my son back to me!

1184
02:54:51,554 --> 02:54:57,356
A mother will curse you
for doing this!

1185
02:54:58,694 --> 02:55:04,633
Give my son back to me!

1186
02:55:12,741 --> 02:55:14,231
Mother!

1187
02:55:14,310 --> 02:55:16,540
The Lord has answered my prayer.

1188
02:55:16,745 --> 02:55:18,975
Thank you, Lord!

1189
02:55:19,415 --> 02:55:21,383
How are you feeIing, Ali?

1190
02:55:21,584 --> 02:55:23,051
Thank The Lord!

1191
02:55:31,026 --> 02:55:34,462
Ones The Lord preserveth
no one can sIay.

1192
02:55:34,530 --> 02:55:37,693
Not even the deviI may touch
ones whom The Lord preserveth.

1193
02:57:57,973 --> 02:58:01,966
No iIIs can eviI-doers perpetrate.

1194
02:58:02,044 --> 02:58:06,879
AII that happens is willed
by The Lord.
