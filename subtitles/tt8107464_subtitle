1
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,750
Faith...

2
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,000
The most valuable in this Universe and
also it is the most misused too...

3
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,250
In this world,

4
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,370
while there are some who are unable to
stand upon the faith without enough power,

5
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,580
there are so many who backstab to the
fullest of their power.

6
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:10,620
This story belongs to faith, love,
backstabbing and punishment.

7
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,120
Fido means faith.

8
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:13,870
Trust.

9
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,830
Fido Pharma group is the business empire
that grew step by step by two close friends

10
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,200
with trust as the foundation
for their friendship

11
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,200
Those close friends are Anand
Prasad and Sanjay Mitra.

12
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,080
They grew up together, studied
and came to America.

13
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,200
One is the life of another.

14
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,750
Luckily those who understood their
friendship came in as their wives

15
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,370
And went along like them.

16
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,410
When Anand Prasad had a son,

17
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,080
both prayed to God that Sanjay Mitra
should have a daughter.

18
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,250
As they wished, Sanjay Mitra was
blessed with a daughter.

19
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,330
They took a decision to convert their
friendship into relationship.

20
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,450
I and Sanjay took a decision.

21
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,330
If you decide together then that is final,
tell what is that.

22
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,370
That is to give our Aishu to
Amar in marriage.

23
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,830
You are too late.

24
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,580
I and Lakshmi fixed for this long back.

25
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,000
This was the God’s decision first,
before all of your decisions.

26
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,830
Jalal felt very happy for that.

27
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,450
He’s a very important
person in their lives.

28
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,080
Though he didn’t study along with them, he
grew up together with them.

29
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,830
That’s why they brought even him
to America with them.

30
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,660
Though friends tried to convince him, he
never married

31
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,950
and remained treating them
as his world and his life.

32
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,000
The entire family decided to get Amar
and Aishwarya married.

33
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,200
Do you know how those two get a long ?

34
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,250
Why are you so tensed?

35
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,080
I’m unable to solve the Home work
-Let me help you

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,700
That’s it.

37
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,750
Thank you.

38
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,080
Will you always be helping me like this?

39
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,950
Yes.

40
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,870
Promise.

41
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,080
Promise.

42
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,620
Cup cakes!

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,750
Amar,

44
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,750
you too...

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,500
Mom, this is really great.

46
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,950
Aishwarya prepared them.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,620
Double A, 'A' for Aishwarya...

48
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,950
and 'A' for Amar.

49
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,450
While both like each other a lot, these
kids live like one person.

50
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,450
Aishu, are you ok?

51
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,950
Aishu, are you ok? I’m sorry, are you ok?
-Yes, I’m ok.

52
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,000
Careful.

53
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,080
Hey Jalal, come on...

54
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,950
Hey, Lakshmi...

55
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:19,950
No...

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,700
No, you have to come. Come, come

57
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,250
Aishu, good job - Hey Aishu.

58
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,120
Even happiness became a member of their
family along with these all.

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,040
Saboo, he came to know that you’re
stealing Drugs from Company

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,950
and are selling to the drug Mafia

61
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,950
Does he not know that all four of us
are doing it together?

62
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,450
Now he would know that.

63
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,200
What shall we do, then?

64
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,120
I came into this world, kicking and
screaming in somebody else’s blood.

65
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,500
I don’t mind going out the same way.

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,200
For us to come into this world, we kick
and tear out from our own mother’s womb.

67
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,330
And so for living, I don’t care
whatever I’ve to do.

68
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,330
Truly scary.

69
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,080
Please don’t do anything to me Sir.

70
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,450
I’ve a family.

71
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,370
Same problem, we too have the families.

72
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,330
I’m not going to tell this to anyone Sir.

73
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,330
Please forgive me.

74
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,450
Not to expect badness from bad
people is madness.

75
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,830
Not expecting bad from bad
guys is madness.

76
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,580
Good shot.

77
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,080
Delicious fish from our league.

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,370
Yeah, but here is a more
delicious feed for our fish.

79
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,750
Today onwards, you four are
not our employees.

80
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,700
What?

81
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,120
Partners.

82
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,870
From now on, you four are 20% share
holders in this company.

83
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,830
Each one gets 5%.

84
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,500
Thank you sir.
-Thank you so much.

85
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,580
You all deserve it.

86
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,200
This partnership is what you earned
with your own hard work.

87
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,620
Sir,when one works hard in a Corporate
Company they limit the reward to increments.

88
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,750
Or they make them happy with bonus.

89
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,950
But to give a partnership...
It’s really great Sir.

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,290
You proved once again that you think about
business with brain

91
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:34,120
And think about
people with hearts, Sir

92
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,080
It’s ok.

93
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,620
Tomorrow is my son Amar’s birthday.

94
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,080
We’re having a party at home.

95
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
We’re all a family now. So,
please be there.

96
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,000
Thanks a lot Sir -Sure,
thank you so much Sir

97
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,500
There will be an end for a human’s
needs but not for the greed.

98
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,120
I feel by giving them a partnership in the
Company,

99
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,830
you gave a chance for them
to think in other ways.

100
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,700
Hey Jalal,

101
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,000
you see everything with magnified glasses
because of your over love on us.

102
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,370
They are very nice people.

103
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,700
Not the loyalty shown in front

104
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,950
but the faithfulness shown
behind is what is Important.

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,580
God knows the truth.

106
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,450
Nancy, this is my sister.

107
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,580
Don’t worry James, I’ll take care of her.

108
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,500
Thank you so much.

109
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,950
Mr. Amar, I hope you’ll not
commit a crime again.

110
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,700
No Sir.

111
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,830
Are you sure, you’ll not come here.

112
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,200
Absolutely sure Sir.

113
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,200
Absolutely sure Sir, I’ll never
ever come here again.

114
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,950
Handover his belongings.

115
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,330
Mr. Amar, you’ve some
benefits waiting for you.

116
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,080
You got this Life insurance.

117
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,080
You thought a lot for us to be safe
even if you’re not here.

118
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,080
Thank you, thank you dad.

119
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,450
Bye!

120
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,830
When we’re in danger,

121
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,580
it isn’t the manpower around us which saves us
but the strength within one self.

122
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,700
Come in... -Nancy.

123
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
James is like my Brother.

124
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,080
Your like my sister.

125
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,950
No, no..no..

126
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,830
Please keep this money.

127
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:10,540
Life is unknown if you don’t see the
strength hidden in the fist

128
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,000
and the daringness in the heart.

129
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,450
Play the game with life and
compete with the time.

130
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,080
See the victory before you die.

131
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,750
Though there’s a path of fire and a
never solving problem

132
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:39,700
You should step ahead and not go
back on our will power.

133
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:47,080
Wrong, right or a trouble, you
should create that.

134
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,580
Let trouble and loss come, you
shall win the war

135
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,080
Wrong, right or a trouble, you
should create that.

136
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,620
Let trouble and loss come, you
shall win the war

137
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,450
Life is unknown if you don’t see the
strength hidden in the fist

138
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,950
and the daringness in the heart.

139
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,950
Here is your food.

140
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,750
Okay, put it on the table and go.

141
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,200
Hello, Doctor!

142
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,330
Mr. Rajveer.

143
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,750
Yeah, the allergy has come back.

144
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,580
Can you please come fast?

145
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,120
Who are you?

146
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,620
The axe forgets but the tree remembers.

147
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,450
Do you remember who put that
ring to your finger?

148
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,700
Amar...

149
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
Yes.

150
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,950
Amar!

151
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,120
It was me who added Shrimp in your food to
give you an allergic attack

152
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,950
How do you know about my allergy?

153
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,370
Life will not forgive the weakness.

154
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,950
Sir, here is water.

155
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,330
Look at me, come baby.

156
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,080
You know what Fido is?

157
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,120
Trust, the faith.

158
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,580
Give it back...

159
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,700
Give it back.

160
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,250
You don’t deserve this.

161
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,330
You deserve this.

162
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,950
Anti-allergic dose?

163
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,450
Doctor will give that.

164
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,950
This is an anti for that.

165
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,080
When both mix, it gets toxic
and the person dies.

166
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,080
Please don’t do that.

167
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,950
There’s no mistake from my
side in what happened.

168
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,500
Confess the mistake you did.

169
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,580
If try to make me believe your innocent,
I feel that you insulted my intelligence.

170
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,830
It makes me very angry.

171
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,830
I did a very big mistake. Forgive me

172
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,580
I’m not a God to forgive and I don’t
have Amnesia to forget.

173
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,000
Don’t do that please.

174
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,500
Please forgive me.

175
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,370
Try to live. Try to tell the Doctor
not to give the dose

176
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,950
This is not a revenge.

177
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,080
It’s a return gift.

178
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,200
Oh my God.. -It's Okay... don't worry.
don't worry.

179
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,950
Relax you will be Okay.

180
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,330
Check the pulse.

181
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,620
Damn, he is no more.

182
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,200
What’s the cause of death, Doctor?

183
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,450
Nothing suspicious Sir. He died
because of food allergy.

184
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,080
What kind of food? - Sea food.

185
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,370
Why would he eat that in spite of
knowing his problems?

186
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,450
We don’t know.

187
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,250
If you don’t know something, don’t jump to
any conclusions. Do I make myself clear?

188
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,580
Who gave that shot?

189
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,330
We don’t know.

190
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,000
Send the body for postmortem.

191
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,080
There’s a syringe mark on the leg.

192
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,950
Ring is missing on his finger.

193
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,580
What can be the reason?

194
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,870
Answer is there in what you said, sir.
For the ring

195
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,750
Value of that watch is more than a crore.

196
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,330
If robbery was the motive, why would he
just take the ring and leave that?

197
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,870
You don’t show interest in matters in
which you don't have benefit,

198
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,080
then why in this matter?

199
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I did a favor to that Rajveer
- You did a favor?

200
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,950
Of course, I charged 2 Million
Dollars for doing that.

201
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,330
Oh, deal? - Yes, deal.

202
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,830
We thought of going to Amsterdam trip if
we get that amount, along with you.

203
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,200
So, is the trip cancelled Sir?

204
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,830
You think I am a fool, right? - No Sir.

205
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,450
You are wondering as to Why I am still
trying to investigate

206
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,830
when the guy who has
to give money is dead. Right?

207
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,950
I’ll tell.

208
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,570
WATA... Whole Andhra and
Telangana Association.

209
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,900
Maa Reddy -tell me Uncle .

210
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,530
You know why we formed this
organization WATA

211
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,900
and how we are celebrating every year?

212
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,070
You said many times uncle - I’ll
say again, listen.

213
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,780
Tell uncle.

214
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,400
We should remember the reason behind this,
every day.

215
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,030
Ok uncle.

216
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,820
Without taking even a single
Dollar from any one,

217
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,700
to give free accommodation along with food
better than a wedding feast is the objective.

218
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,700
I took care of everything on my
own till two years back

219
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,030
As pressures too grew along with the age,
I couldn’t continue and left it out.

220
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,820
You put an organizing committee, right
uncle? - I understood after forming that.

221
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,280
That Miryalu idiot claims half the credit
is his, if a Dog breeds four puppies.

222
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,030
Greedy idiot!

223
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,150
Hey brother, your shoe lace.
- Thank you brother.

224
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,070
No problem

225
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,200
I got this special for you from Niagara
falls. - Ok, thank you.

226
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,070
Mr. Kandulu is there, right uncle?
- He is full of sarcasm.

227
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,820
He is a type to murder with
just the words.

228
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,150
Even when he invites it appears like
he is insulting others.

229
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,780
Hello Addala Sir
- I’m adjusting my pant.

230
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,950
We fixed a package of 1000 Dollars per
family,

231
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,030
It appears that we should consider
even body sizes from now.

232
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,780
Looks like Madam got angry,

233
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,030
It is ok if that anger is shown on you

234
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,650
but what will be our situation if
it is shown on food?

235
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,450
Hey, who is that? Push them out
- He and his dirty sarcasm.

236
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,780
And that Gandikota is the
heights of false prestige

237
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,700
(Hey moon, my cute
darling...) (Song humming)

238
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,780
Hello Sir, how are you?

239
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,400
To touch my hand, you need a range,
Maintain some distance.

240
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,320
It may be anyone, they should keep 4 feet
away from our Gandikota dynasty members.

241
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,820
For not spreading the disease.
- For you or to us?

242
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,360
Seeing that style,one feels that he has
come from some corporate family not

243
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,700
knowing he’s the son of a
graveyard keeper.

244
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,030
And Chetan Sharma!

245
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,530
The man is good, but his brain is dull.

246
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,070
I’m unable to take care of
everything alone Sir.

247
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Oh no...

248
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,900
You’re very lucky dude, what if it
was the right hand?

249
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,200
That's why I’ve thought and put my left
hand Sir - Have you seen?

250
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Maa Reddy - Uncle.

251
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,400
Keep an eye on that committee

252
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,820
I’ll keep both the eyes, you take
this tablet first, uncle.

253
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,030
I’ll show who Pulla Reddy is and who
this Maa Reddy is...

254
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,700
Don’t try to hit with caste feeling.

255
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,400
I just have only the Telugu feeling

256
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,200
Who is a Telugu guy?

257
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,950
The greatest of all in the world
in wearing a dhoti...

258
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,030
A guy not going out without the scarf.

259
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,400
I feel very happy seeing all Telugu
people so close like this.

260
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,650
Our people only think about earning income
and not about any other problems.

261
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,530
There'll be food but no time

262
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,700
There'll be money but no mental peace.

263
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,860
There'll be no holidays for Telugu
festivals

264
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,570
And our culture will not be
there in festivals of the whites.

265
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,150
With this same mouth taliking about pity,
I’m giving an advice.

266
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,200
Never bend for the blind faiths.

267
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,530
When our time is running bad,

268
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,780
some people come forward saying
that they will set it right.

269
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,650
Is this any clock to set it right?

270
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,650
Never believe in anyone.

271
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,650
Mainly never believe the people who
come with a scarf like me.

272
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,280
May all be good and happy.

273
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
Come on clap - Standing ovation guys.

274
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,780
Tanikella Sir, thanks for accepting our
invitation and coming down.

275
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,610
Gandikota Sir,

276
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,780
you are feeling too much, he accepted
the invitation of Pulla Reddy Sir.

277
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,320
That’s why he came on his
own flight ticket.

278
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,450
Leave it man, show me the room first
so that I can relax.

279
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,150
You spent for your own flight ticket and
can’t you book your own room?

280
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,700
There’s a limit even for the good nature.

281
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,400
Mall has an escalator to go up - There
will be steps to get down.

282
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,950
Moral is that none cares about us
after the work is done.

283
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,570
you are kidding me.

284
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,820
You’ll be ruined if I curse you.

285
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,610
What’s it sir, you just said not to
believe those with a scarf and

286
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,280
you forgot so fast?

287
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,070
Maybe Bharani Sir got Alzheimer

288
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,450
Forgive us Sir - So funny...

289
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,450
Oh no, who do we have now in America?

290
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,320
What about Kajal and Prabhudeva?
- All are ready.

291
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,780
Why do you ask like you’re boss and we’re
the assistants? -What is this?

292
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,900
What is this? - What?

293
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,780
If you say what is that what, I’ll
give answer to that.

294
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,650
Reddy Sir used to conduct the function
without collecting

295
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,570
a single Dollar till two years back.

296
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,150
Entry fee entered only after you came in.

297
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,650
Special taxes wasn’t there in India two
years back and it came now, right?

298
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,900
You should encourage the change.

299
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,280
What to encourage Sir?

300
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,070
You’re taking 1000 Dollars each and
stuffing three families in a single room.

301
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,450
The food is so bad, we’re
unable to eat that.

302
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,320
You’ll die if you eat more
so it is good only.

303
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,030
What is this?

304
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,400
What’s the way of answering?

305
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,780
Don’t you have common sense?

306
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,820
Is it not atrocious?

307
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Is there anything like good
and humanity in you?

308
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,570
We can’t answer so many questions.

309
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,400
Gayle

310
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,900
Yes Sir

311
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,030
Pollard. - Yes Sir

312
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,200
Attack - Yes.

313
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,150
What’s this? You hit if asked? -
You manhandle people?

314
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,320
What’s this injustice, why do you hit?
- Where are we?

315
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,070
Is this America or Ambajipeta?

316
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,820
That bald guy remembered his native
place from Gayle’s shot.

317
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,450
Don’t underestimate the
power of a common man.

318
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,780
I’ve mailed what all you’re doing in
detail to Reddy Sir.

319
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,070
Maa Reddy - Uncle.

320
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,150
Open the mail, let’s see what has come.

321
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,650
Uncle, time is up and you take the tablet.

322
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,530
What’s this? I feel everything
drowsy Maa Reddy.

323
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,400
You feel a bit drowsy when you
take this tablet, uncle.

324
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,530
Not a bit dude, I’m unable to see at all.

325
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,900
Keeping aside the mail... if you don’t
give accounts this time,

326
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,450
even that 108 won’t come here to save you.

327
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,150
You know right? I’ve come saying a
pack up for factionism.

328
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,530
Don’t bring me back into form again.

329
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,650
Leave no .

330
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,900
See you Pulla Reddy Sir.

331
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,900
For your manners and... - Leave now idiot

332
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:06,780
Maa Reddy... there’s some trance in your
medicine... I always feel sleepy.

333
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,820
I’m the one erasing the localite Robert
creating complications for your
California Pharma unit.

334
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,950
Your friend Rajveer had promised me 5
Million Dollars for that.

335
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,900
Payment is still due.

336
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,400
Mr. Balwant Kharge, who is Robert?

337
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,780
Yes!

338
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,530
When one goes to the father of a dead son
and ask about his debts due,

339
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,280
he conveniently would lie even in that
pain stating that he doesn't know anything.

340
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Same strategy is being applied here - All
wouldn’t be like that Sir.

341
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,530
I’m talking about the majority, you don’t
come in between Chidamabaram.

342
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,570
I’ve got something for you.

343
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,450
Your partner Rajveer’s isn’t
a natural death.

344
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,200
It was a pre-planned
meticulously executed murder

345
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,030
This is his postmortem report.

346
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,780
You can go through this if you want to.

347
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,900
We feel sad when a friend who
accompanied in good deeds is dead.

348
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,320
When a partner in bad deeds is killed,
we get frightened.

349
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,780
Because that death may come even
searching for you.

350
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,820
I know, whatever sins committed, by
four of you... I’m sorry

351
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,450
whatever work was done, you four
always did that together.

352
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,780
So, tell me now.

353
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,780
Yes, now we are talking.

354
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,650
If I was an officer working just for
salary, I wouldn’t have killed Robert,right?

355
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,150
You give me the list of those
you feel are enemies

356
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,570
and I’ll identify who’s
the murderer from that.

357
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,150
Adam Cannelon and Jeff Thompson!

358
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,150
Brian Phillips and Steve Hawl!

359
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,320
Anymore?

360
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,900
Remember well, is there anyone more?

361
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,900
There’s one more small
duckling but not a threat.

362
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,530
If Hit at the right place, even a
small stone takes a life.

363
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,400
Duckling, tell me even about that.

364
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,400
If plan fails... - I don’t have a plan B.

365
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,030
Just definite way is to make plan A works.

366
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,150
Okay.

367
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,200
I’ll find out who the threat is from these
persons and come and meet you again.

368
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,950
Then we’ll lock the deal.

369
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,030
Chidamabaram - Sir

370
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,570
Listening to this deal, your feeling is
that it won’t work, right?

371
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,030
To be frank, that’s true Sir.

372
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,150
Yes, I know.

373
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,530
My whole life may not be enough to
prove something to you.

374
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,280
Let’s see

375
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,450
While writing the story of your life,
don’t let anyone else hold the pen.

376
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,780
Don’t put the pen writing your life
history in the hands of others.

377
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,400
Amazing.

378
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,400
Call Devil.

379
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,900
Can you please give me the
details of Amar?

380
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,780
That’s interesting I am not
seeing it come up.

381
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,530
What?

382
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,650
Hey David, can you pull up Amar’s file?
- Yes Sir.

383
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,820
How is it doing over there?
- No Sir, I can’t find anything on.

384
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,780
That’s impossible, he was just here

385
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,900
Bandipotu (Bandit) Sir

386
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,400
Sorry Gandikota Sir.

387
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,320
What’s this chicken like half burn corpse,
damn!

388
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,030
Why not put it slowly, why
this sound pollution?

389
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,400
Any sound other than the skull breaking
noise is an irritation for you.

390
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,320
Don’t disturb and let me enjoy the match,
the next ball is a four.

391
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,030
I see.

392
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,280
Oh no, how did you say so like
Puttaparti Saibaba?

393
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,320
This is Cricinfo and that is late
info and one over late.

394
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,950
Come on, give that here.
-Monthly subscription.

395
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,650
Sir, did India start the batting? - Can’t
you see? Come and be seated

396
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,570
Yes, Kohli has started. If in India, I’d
have started the betting by now.

397
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,780
Feel even this as India - What’s the
position of next ball?

398
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,200
Either a four or a six.

399
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,400
Other than out, everything is for you.

400
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,650
What, all other than out are for me?

401
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,900
Here is 1000 Dollars betting,
come on let’s see

402
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,320
Oh no... -Yes...

403
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,400
He is booked.

404
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,150
What next?

405
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,200
Except three runs everything to you.

406
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,150
What... except three runs,
everything to me?

407
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,530
Cover everything I lost.
- I’ll do it this time.

408
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,530
Here is two thousand Dollars.

409
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,950
Oh.. care ful.

410
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,400
Three runs.

411
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,150
This time close betting

412
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,650
Super - How it is brother?

413
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,900
If you bet what all you have, we give
back whatever you lost.

414
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,450
What is the offer, brother?

415
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,200
Mega offer! except run out,

416
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,150
Oh, is everything for me?

417
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,900
Then here is a Credit card
and a Debit card.

418
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,650
Everything means everything Sir .

419
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,820
The rings, bracelets, chains -
Including the Rolex watch.

420
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,150
Sir, just think for once - Go, like a
bad omen for everything.

421
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,650
Now, we don’t need a run. Just relax

422
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,700
Hey, take care. Be careful. Take care.

423
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,530
Out!

424
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,900
All out here - Not out here.

425
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,780
Who is that?

426
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,900
New batsman entered into the crease.

427
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,950
Who is he?

428
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,030
A new goat.

429
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,530
Come Sir, be seated - Have a seat.

430
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,530
Hey, get up! even food is a waste for a
gone case like you, get up.

431
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,530
Now, my... - Sit down brother.

432
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,150
We both shall see the match
and we’ll have fun.

433
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,570
Open it fast - Phone is not
getting unlocked.

434
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,150
Now tell me what happens in next ball.

435
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,070
You manage...
- Sir, chance is yours now.

436
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,070
Except six... everything to you,
who is the lucky guy?

437
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,900
Wait, I will do.
- I got it, I got it.

438
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,030
1000 Dollars

439
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,150
Sir, don’t be in a hurry.

440
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,650
Dhoni has just come and how’ll hit six for
the first ball itself Sir?

441
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,150
He’ll come on front foot and hit.

442
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,400
Yes, Dhoni is always Dhoni. Sir!

443
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,700
They snached everything from me

444
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,570
and now it looks like you are going
to snatch everything from them Sir.

445
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,200
Rub the finger.

446
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,320
Is charging there?

447
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,780
If you stop your mutual meeting,
we’ll go for the next ball.

448
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,070
A small technical - Hey...

449
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,450
Choice is yours Sir.

450
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,650
except four, everything to you.
- That’s a good deal.

451
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,570
Let’s put that 2000 and
recover everything.

452
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,780
Four.

453
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:44,900
Oh Sir, there is some magic
in your mouth Sir.

454
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,570
Wait, I’ll give a tissue and you rub it.

455
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,200
Now, a big bet

456
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,950
Offer

457
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,900
Mega offer.

458
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,570
What is that?

459
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,530
It will go for six on off-side. Other than
that everything is yours.

460
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,400
And the bet?

461
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,200
I’ll bet everything I have and you
bet what all you have.

462
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,780
Including watches, rings and the chains.

463
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,900
Sir, we won’t get a better chance
than this for recovery.

464
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,450
Hey, wait rascal.

465
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,570
Offers sounds good but the results
are getting reversed.

466
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,450
Dhoni off-side sixer is impossible.

467
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,450
Dad always used to say that courage
brings us the wealth.

468
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,400
You all be stubborn with hands on the
heart and I’ll take care of this.

469
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,900
Take it out and put that

470
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,740
Sir, we earned with great difficulty and
got so much.

471
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,200
Now you bet
everything and I’m tensed Sir.

472
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,200
Don’t worry bro, God is always with us.

473
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,900
Okay.

474
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,070
Dhoni bro!

475
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,030
Nawab Sir!

476
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,700
Don't keep on touching me...
will get Infection.

477
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,150
Off-side six is impossible?

478
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,030
Should we place hands on the heart?

479
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,200
My dad said...

480
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,150
Is your dad NTR or you’re Balakrishna?

481
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Your background itself is a burial ground,
and you're my background again?

482
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,700
Miriyala! - How then?

483
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,030
They were life time savings, idiot

484
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,280
Idiot..?

485
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,530
Then what else to say? If I hit
with this bottle...

486
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,780
I’ll just take my 1000 and all
the rest is yours.

487
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Why for me Sir, you earned with hard work.

488
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,900
I keep away from this game and
this game was for you.

489
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,400
What should I answer my wife when she asks
about these extra items?

490
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,700
Many thanks Sir . - This... Just give this
watch, my in-laws gave that

491
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,650
If you give me the phone, I’ll leave.

492
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,400
You snatched everything and will
you take even this?

493
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,650
( Song humming...)

494
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
That mean...

495
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,030
This is fraud, it’s cheating.

496
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,530
Yes

497
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,200
Tit for tat!

498
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,450
This Akbar never tolerates lies and
cheating. for every lie I strip everyone.

499
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,280
I will chase down and hit, rascals!

500
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,030
This fellow has followed us like a devil.

501
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,200
You saw every ball like a
student copying in exam.

502
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,530
And he saw for once and
remembered the whole over.

503
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,530
Did you watch him seeing? - Yes Sir.

504
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,900
Why didn’t you say when you saw? - How
could I say when he was seeing, Sir?

505
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,650
Why not give a signal? - How do I signal
when he is seeing, Sir?

506
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,150
Ok dude, don’t get angry. You’re correct.

507
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,030
These four aren’t there amongst the
persons you doubted.

508
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,570
They really aren’t there now.

509
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,900
Jesus!

510
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,950
Then who? - The Duckling.

511
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,650
The duckling has become death

512
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,650
Amar - Yes, Amar.

513
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,030
Did he release from the jail?

514
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,200
Guy growing in between many kids,

515
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,530
I mean growing with brothers
and sisters will have great brain.

516
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:27,950
And he grew up together for 14 long years
with 2300 very hard core

517
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,280
Jackson prisoners.

518
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,280
There’d be 2300 reasons for those 2300
criminals to be caught.

519
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,700
He knows all those very well.

520
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Even before he got released from Jail,

521
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,700
he took care to erase all the
evidences about him in the jail.

522
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,030
Nobody knows where he stays, how he
looks and how he would come.

523
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,820
No one knows it

524
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,400
Honestly speaking, I feel all three of you
are in a very dangerous situation.

525
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,820
Death in an invisible form is
very close to you.

526
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,700
So, now tell me how much are you going to
pay me for saving your lives?

527
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
You tell me?

528
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,150
How do I know the value of your lives?
How can I know that?

529
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,650
One Million Dollars.

530
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,150
I may not know the value of your lives.

531
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,900
But I know very well about the
value of your properties.

532
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,780
Life is very important for
you to enjoy them

533
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,530
Think and quote.

534
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,400
Why to bargain with him? We
have the devil, right?

535
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,700
When devil comes close and says you can’t
withstand the storm,

536
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,530
he says in that
devil’s ear that he’s that storm.

537
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,450
Bullets aren’t enough to handle him, but
you need to have brains.

538
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,280
So, consider everything calmly
and quote the price.

539
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,530
5 Million Dollars.

540
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,570
Yes, deal done.

541
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,200
I’ll very soon find him out and
finish him legally, ok?

542
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
You should come in time when money
is taken, right? -Yes.

543
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
That basic punctual...

544
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,450
You are...

545
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,200
I’m Pooja, event Manager

546
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,150
This is my team.

547
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,700
I’m Chanti Miryala, treasurer of this
committee and payment section.

548
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,950
Hello Sir.

549
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
The decoration is damn good,
great job actually...

550
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,150
Thank you, our Moni did this.

551
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,150
And sound system is splendid,
excellent actually

552
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,200
Thank you so much, Sony is done it.

553
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,150
Hello.

554
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,820
It’s me who selected you after carefully
studying your previous prestigious works.

555
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,070
Actually, this is my first major event.

556
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,530
I think, there’s a mistake in the report.

557
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,570
This guy wrote it

558
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,780
He’s my boy - Hello.

559
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,400
If you have any problem, any time, call
me. 24/7 I’m available.

560
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,570
Thank you Sir - Really nice meeting you.

561
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,400
Thank you, I’ll carry on.

562
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,150
I’ve lots of work. Excuse me... - Yeah.

563
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Damn!

564
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,530
She came like dry fruit into my dry life.
She’s made for me

565
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,150
I think golden days of Pullanna
Sir is started again

566
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,650
All items are super.

567
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,150
Sarma Sir, ice cream is great.

568
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,650
Hey girls, come here.

569
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,450
What’s her domination
without my permission?

570
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,900
Who takes the responsibility when what all
we saved with great difficulty is emptied?

571
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,400
Looks like something is running bad, there
in the morning and here now.

572
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:11,900
Enough.

573
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,400
See Sony, eventually at the end of the
day money is everything.

574
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,280
Why not ask for our permission
before doing something.

575
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,900
It’s basic.

576
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,150
She isn’t doing all this with your money
to take your permission.

577
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,780
Then?

578
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,950
Unable to see the pain of the guests,

579
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,650
she booked extra rooms and arranged quality
food with her own money.

580
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,150
Is a girl working for her
living doing all this?

581
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,150
Excuse me, Pooja works for passion.

582
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,570
By the way, she’s filthy rich.
Let’s go girls

583
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,950
Kandula...Come on, let’s go and eat.

584
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,950
It seems all the items are great - Money
of the others is very sweet.

585
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,070
Poor fellow, thought to trap her showing
the financial difference

586
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,150
and what will you do now?

587
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,280
I’ll put in extra effort.

588
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,780
If I trap Pooja, even life gets
settled along with marriage.

589
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,530
Just go and check that for me

590
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,280
Pooja madam.

591
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,950
Though you had no link to the guests, you
did everything for them.

592
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,650
Your heart is so great.

593
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
I’m very happy.

594
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,450
You’re also feeling so happy though you
have no relation to them.

595
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,650
I too am happy - Thank you.

596
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,950
Every murderer will have a style,
including the psycho killers.

597
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:15,570
Easy target for Amar coming out from the
jail isn’t Rajveer, but Vikram Talwar.

598
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
But why did he kill Rajveer?

599
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,700
Fido!

600
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,950
Did Rajveer also have the same ring?

601
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,650
Yes - Yes

602
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,280
But, that ring wasn’t there on the
finger of dead Rajveer.

603
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,030
There’s a clue. There’s a
connection to it.

604
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,700
I want to know all the stories
behind these rings.

605
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,780
Now I got the answer.

606
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,700
He’s going in a well organized
manner and in an order.

607
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,820
I’m sorry to say this Mr. Vikram Talwar,
but Amar’s next target is you

608
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,700
What?

609
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,900
My total focus from now on is on you.

610
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,030
Why are you focussing the guy who is going
to die rather than

611
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,150
on the guy
who is going to kill, Sir.

612
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,030
Hey Chidamabaram, they’ll get offended.

613
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,150
You shouldn’t talk negative
before the customers

614
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,700
I said it is easy to catch that
guy by following him.

615
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,950
Got my point?

616
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,400
Got it sir.

617
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:20,700
Famous peace messenger, person who has
stopped world wars successfully,

618
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,330
KA Paul’s descendent...

619
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,750
Hearty welcome to Junior Paul!

620
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,500
Please give him a big round of applause.

621
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,870
Enough, give it here now.

622
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Sir, it’s a honor.

623
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,950
Thanks for coming Sir

624
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,080
Hello!

625
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,120
It is personal. we don't
care for such things.

626
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,950
She is my personal

627
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
He doesn’t know that

628
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,580
Paul is great!

629
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,620
Disciple’s salutes to Senior Paul Sir!

630
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,450
Presidents and Prime Ministers call me for
prayers across 148 nations.

631
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:02,750
Look if you want to, they published in
Times of India, in Economic Times...

632
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,750
and wrote even in Sitara and Santosham.

633
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,450
Paul is great!

634
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,830
Master called me recently at late night

635
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,870
And said you should give the message at
the celebrations of Telugu brothers.

636
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,620
I was shocked and said, “me, master?”

637
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:19,580
He said are we different, if I’m
milk you’re butter milk

638
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,580
Still, when he went on to moon
for Universal peace,

639
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,830
he patted on my shoulder with love saying
World peace is my responsibility.

640
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,750
After that he flew in 747 Boeing for
vacation to Australia

641
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,450
And I came here to
America for this occasion.

642
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,950
With his blessing,

643
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:39,200
I reached to a stage of flying in Boeing
from a stage of collecting coal.

644
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,200
Good tie up, you burn and he
would collect the coal.

645
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,700
Kandula, who do you think he is?
-He said it, right?

646
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,580
Original is different,

647
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,950
he is an expert in black magic and is the
killer whom I called to kill Pulla Reddy.

648
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,500
He is a demon in human form

649
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,370
What’s this coloring of a peace messenger?

650
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,620
It’s his covering to cheat the public

651
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,700
He uses Mr. Paul’s name for that.

652
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,620
The hard work you do to do the good!

653
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:09,080
So, the message I would give to you is to
be happy with 3 lemons and 6 chilies.

654
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,620
Oh my Paul!

655
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,950
Once when we had gone to meet Bush,

656
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,080
we gave lemons and did the prayer and
he became the President

657
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,580
Next when we had gone to meet Obama,

658
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,700
We prayed giving the chilies and he
became the President.

659
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,700
Similarly the growth and peace
at the soul for all!

660
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,080
Oh my Paul!

661
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,830
Wishing for a mental peace for all,
may Ghosts bless you!

662
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,500
Mr. Paul!

663
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,000
May God bless you

664
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,700
Hey girl... 407.

665
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,950
Hello Bandipotu Sir Sorry Gandikota Sir

666
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,830
That word sorry is sounding
more insulting for me

667
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,580
Leave that, Pulla Reddy Sir is strong like
the elephant at the temple.

668
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,450
Will the work be completed by that
waste fellow Junior Paul?

669
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:49,950
Slowly...

670
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,450
Hey, you go out - Why Sir?

671
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,120
Hey, go.

672
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,700
His dad is Khadra, Bista Khadra

673
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,830
His name is Darkha, Bista Darkha

674
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,450
Why build up like Basha, Manik Basha?

675
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,330
When dad is from Bista, will
son be from Palasa?

676
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,750
Respect Miryala, he kills
right with his looks.

677
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,620
Is he any Balaiah Babu to kill with looks?

678
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,870
Don’t unnecessarily elevate him Sir.

679
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,040
His dad Bista based on budget with various
black magic tricks

680
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,120
used to silently
finish plants to trees,

681
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,370
cubs to buffaloes and kids to
men without any mercy.

682
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,580
What’s he doing now?

683
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,910
People with a revenge over him, caught
him, broke his teeth,

684
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,250
tied him to a
tree and burnt him alive.

685
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,450
Khadra furious with that
- Did he turn dark?

686
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,750
Turned into a Dracula - Oh no!

687
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,830
He crossed even Khadra in
black magic - Damn!

688
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,330
Hello, we’re in a serious discussion
and who called you here?

689
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,950
Not when call comes but Akbar comes
in when he gets a doubt.

690
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,450
I studied him - You did?

691
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,330
My mind says...

692
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,330
Not like a Peace messenger, but he looks
to be a black magic guy

693
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,370
This is Akbar. I peel the devil’s skin and
beat it up till it runs away.

694
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,200
Hello Sir

695
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,200
What Mr. Junnu Paul?

696
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,830
You stare so harshly at us and bend your
head in fear seeing that fellow.

697
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,080
We’ve doubts on your capacity

698
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,950
Do you have? - Yes

699
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,000
Do you have? - Yes

700
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,200
Is there a tree?

701
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,080
Yes, Darkha Sir.

702
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,870
Let us meet there tomorrow at
Sunrise - Sunrise means

703
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,620
Even his dad was so. In 70s...
- Go away idiot.

704
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,080
He asked to come early in the morning, is
it for breakfast? -Let us go and see

705
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,580
He will be... - Oh no, the tree.

706
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,330
Is it there?

707
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,580
No tree and no doubts, master.

708
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,450
I’ll say the requirements to kill Pulla
Reddy, write down. - Ok Master

709
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,200
¼ Kg flour

710
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,330
1 Kg Ghee

711
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,700
3 Lemons - Ok.

712
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,080
And 6 chilies -Ok Master,

713
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,200
I’ll bring right away from Walmart.

714
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,830
That is not acceptable. -Then which way?

715
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,700
Rice flour made from organic
rice brought from Araku

716
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,330
Ok.

717
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,700
Ghee from the cow born to Ongole
bull and Punganur cow

718
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,000
Get Lemon from Nimmakur and
Chilies from Miryalaguda.

719
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,200
It’s better to get Special status for the
state than all these master.

720
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,500
Mr.Pal - Master

721
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,700
Mr. Babu will take care of that. First,
you do what I said.

722
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,200
Master, I need a favor - Tell me.

723
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,370
I saw a girl just yesterday and she should
be fall for me in a week.

724
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,120
She will vomit blood and fall down, go get
all I said in double dose.

725
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,750
Master

726
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,580
What’s wrong again?

727
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,450
I got to marry her. It’s totally a
different scenario.

728
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,000
I see

729
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,160
You do something and make
her fall in love first

730
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,000
and then I’ll do
something for the marriage.

731
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,200
What’ll you take care after he takes all
the strain? - I’ll mix the dough.

732
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,870
Paul Sir.

733
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,000
It’s human effort first and God or the
devil comes after that.

734
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Ghost bless you - Thank you Grand Master.

735
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,580
Yes, Sarojini Naidu...

736
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,580
Who are all these? Are they missing?

737
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,950
What! They’re famous people of our country

738
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,450
Few kids here when asked who is father of
nation are saying George Bush.

739
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,200
When asked Andhra Kesari, they’re
saying Abraham Lincoln.

740
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,870
I thought it would be like reminding our
culture and the great people of our nation.

741
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,080
Hey, great minds think alike!

742
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,080
I too conduct such classes on weekends
and educate the children.

743
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,830
My boy literally worships me.

744
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,830
He always says boy like I’m an office boy.

745
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,750
Seeing all these like this, I feel like seeing
my childhood friends after a long time,

746
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,080
extremely Nostalgic

747
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,580
Is it?

748
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,330
You know who these are?

749
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,750
He’s come, He’ll teach him a lesson.

750
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,250
Hey man, what work do you have here?

751
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,830
This is our culture and our tradition.

752
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,700
Not about the caste or religion, but of
the nation. My India is great

753
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,200
Who is he?

754
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,200
Come on Say...

755
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,200
The horse is dead.

756
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,080
(There is no time my friend, is it a
compromise or a war?)

757
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,700
Got it.

758
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,830
Gauthamiputra Satakarni by Krish

759
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,330
Wow, what knowledge.

760
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,580
Even I get surprised many
times looking at my talent and

761
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,700
my boy literally...

762
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,450
Huh, not possible for me to bear for
so many times - Got it.

763
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,830
Then, who is he? - With pleasure

764
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:40,250
(I’m like Telugu language present
there and even here.)

765
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,250
Again got it,

766
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,450
He has a beard and so he is
Gona Ganna Reddy.

767
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
He is there and here also

768
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,870
Wow, what a logic

769
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,000
if he has beard then Ganna Reddy and when
in a dhoti he is Rajasekhar Reddy

770
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,500
You said it very well Sir

771
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,370
Ok, who is he then?

772
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,950
Horse is in the background and the
beard looks trimmed.

773
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,330
Sword is too significant

774
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,450
Kathi Mahesh, I don't think it’s him.

775
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,790
Why not? If he has Kathi(sword) then he is
Kathi Mahesh

776
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,000
And if he has a Ganta (bell),
then he’s Ganta Srinivasa Rao.

777
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,200
Shut up!

778
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,200
First one is Sri Krishnadevaraya.

779
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,330
They say him King of literature and war
and possessor of all arts.

780
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,700
The second is Alluri Seetharama Raju, they
say he is the warrior of Manyam.

781
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,700
He made the British pee.

782
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,080
He is making you pee - Cut the crap.

783
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,500
He’s Sivaji Maharaj and they
call him Chatrapathi.

784
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,200
Chatra... Why’s he not having similarities
to Prabhas then?

785
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,830
He’s not filmy
Chatrapathi but Chatrapathi from history

786
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,450
I know it

787
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,580
I’m testing whether he knows it or not.

788
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,080
In between for entertaining you all, I
acted like not knowing anything.

789
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,330
You too couldn’t catch means
I did a great job.

790
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,200
Pooja, I’ll catch you later - Yeah.

791
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,000
I’ve so much of work

792
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,200
We don’t have any works now Sir

793
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,080
We won’t have but we shall
create - Leave me Sir .

794
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,950
You’re my boy da...

795
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,080
I’m unable to bear with his flirting.
Thank you Sir.

796
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,330
You don’t worry. I’m with you - Thank you

797
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,120
Welcome Sir - Welcome Sir .

798
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,830
Thank you.

799
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,080
How’s Mr. Pulla Reddy. -
He’s in a trance Sir

800
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,450
I mean, he’s in resting Sir.

801
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:10,950
Move aside, move - Please come Sir

802
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,580
Move aside, move... -Please move aside,
move...

803
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,330
Move I say.

804
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:17,080
Bro, who is this person coming. - Fido
Pharmacy Vice Chirman, Mr. Vikram Talwar

805
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,120
He is also the owner of 12 Casinos and
he’s the chief guest this year.

806
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,450
Hello, you became a great man.

807
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,870
He means you’re a great man. He
has a language problem.

808
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,200
All problems are created because of them

809
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,120
They collected 1000 Dollars from each
guest

810
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,580
And snached it all without
providing any facilities.

811
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,700
Hey man, shut up. Why all these for him?

812
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,330
He’s a great man.

813
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:47,330
You won’t listen to us like this. Pollard,
Gayle!

814
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:09,450
You tell me Sir, is it wrong to cheat
the people who believed?

815
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,580
It’s wrong.

816
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,830
Then, should there be a punishment
for cheating or not?

817
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,250
Should punishment be there or not?

818
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,450
Yes, should be punished

819
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,500
Then, should implement immediately.

820
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,950
Say it all to Pulla Reddy sir upstairs.
These idiots are not letting us meet.

821
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:28,950
Sure

822
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,830
Leaving aside about the payment done or
not,

823
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,330
We got the set ready by
Art Director Prakash

824
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,950
We’ve put Thaman in room for three days,
didn’t let him sleep

825
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:39,830
and made him do a song.

826
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,250
I made that Viswa fellow do hard work and
made him write the lyric as per my taste.

827
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,700
After we did so much is
Kajal not coming now?

828
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,080
Even Prabhu Deva isn’t coming. -Oh no.

829
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,370
What’s this? We told them that we will pay
immediately after the program, right?

830
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,330
We should have the credibility, right?

831
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,080
Understood

832
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,830
This for sure is a blow by Mr.
Tanikella Bharani.

833
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,950
What about your blow to him?

834
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,700
My grandma used to say - Just shut your
filthy mouth. You and your dirty grandma

835
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,950
Hey, audience will make a mess if there
isn’t a program on the final day of the event.

836
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,950
It’s tough to control them.

837
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,200
We shall arrange for tear gas - Get it.

838
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:02,950
No need.

839
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,700
I’ll replace Kajal

840
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,120
I’ll match Prabhu Deva and
the issue is closed

841
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,450
Hey man, don’t talk senseless.

842
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,830
Pooja madam can match Kajal but Prabhu
Deva is a professional dancer

843
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,250
This is Akbar and a pure entertainer.

844
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,370
This show is a sure shot blockbuster.

845
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:38,370
Hey, hello... hello... Don Bosco. Go..
go..go and look into your work.

846
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,250
Try as much as you can.

847
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,120
I can’t be got, take care

848
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,700
Hey hello... hello... Don Bosco. Go..
go..go and look into your work.

849
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,120
You can’t get my beauty.

850
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,330
You can get Uber cabs to Galaxies

851
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,830
You can grow crops in the
middle of Sahara desert

852
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:05,080
Yu can take pictures of nukes
in Kim Jong’s house.

853
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,580
Hey, you can ask Trump for Visas

854
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:13,080
You can say Sensex trends in advance.

855
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,700
You can shift Atlantic Ocean to Hyderabad.

856
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,950
But you won’t get the switch to my heart,
don’t draw a sketch.

857
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,500
I’ll aim my eye on you

858
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:19,580
I’ll invent an app and using that I’ll
step into your heart map

859
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,750
I’ll say hail to your guts and
ignite hope in you

860
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:28,870
I’ll make you go mad saying you can’t
get me whatever you do.

861
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:33,830
Is your glamour an unsolvable puzzle
like the Rubics cube?

862
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:38,450
Are you worried that I won’t come
along as your part babe?

863
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,580
You don’t show off your attitude with
your show to the Roman God

864
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:47,200
Hey, hello... hello... Don Bosco. Go..
go..go and look into your work.

865
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,950
Try as much as you can I can’t be got,
take care.

866
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,580
Hey, hello... hello... Don Bosco. Go..
go..go and look into your work.

867
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,200
You can’t get my beauty

868
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,450
Miryala, what’s our share this time?

869
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,700
Got it, 3.3 Million.

870
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,830
Wow, very good

871
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,330
This is a record similar to Bahubali

872
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,580
Cheers - Cheers.

873
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,620
What did we achieve to do these
celebrations, Sir?

874
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,580
This success meet is as we
reached our target.

875
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,750
Hello to all - Welcome.

876
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,830
Come and be seated

877
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,200
Will you have a peg? - Happily,
make a large

878
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,700
It’s ready, have it - Go on.

879
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,620
Yes man, you always say that you will
strip the lies and uncover the cheating,
right?

880
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,700
You made our Miryala into Pepper powder
and what will you do with us?

881
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,500
What did you do? You are great people.

882
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,950
Are we great men?

883
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,000
That Pulli guy said not to
collect from anybody.

884
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,830
We pulled 1000 Dollars per head.

885
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:54,450
He said free accommodation - We made that
also into paid accommodation.

886
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,950
Have you seen their bad deeds, Maa reddy?

887
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,370
Come on in Mr. Maa Reddy.

888
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,200
He keeps you so high, always
calling you by name.

889
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,700
But Pulli guy doesn’t know that you are
our man. -That is the matter

890
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,450
What has he done? He looks like an idiot.

891
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,330
Old man used to always make
nuisance to come down.

892
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,450
I used to give him 10 tablets a day
and put him to sleep.

893
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,950
If I had given four more tables, he would
have died with Kidney failure.

894
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,700
You made the public into fools taking 1000
Dollars each from those poor fellows

895
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,830
They are not fools but crazy idiots.

896
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,870
They couldn’t do anything though we did
whatever we wanted to.

897
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,370
They dress in blazers over their bellies.

898
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,450
You know one more thing?

899
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:29,830
They feel it was Royal Salute they drank
and don’t know what we mixed in this.

900
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,370
What are you all here? Go

901
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,870
Gayle! Pollard!

902
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,330
Both are out

903
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,750
How did they know about all this matter?

904
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,330
I gave a live connection and
as I informed...

905
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:45,330
I strip and hit for lies. I
chase and beat up.

906
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:55,620
You should give three years
accounts with penny.

907
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,120
They already said Reddy Sir, they said
Bahubali record and 3.3 Million.

908
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,830
You tell them the recovery date

909
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,620
You should give back
everything in week days.

910
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,450
Chetan Sharma.

911
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,700
I liked your loyalty and fear
in sin very much.

912
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,250
Sir.

913
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,200
You’re WATA President next year.
- Thank you Sir.

914
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,370
Why are you crying ? - You got beaten
up because of us, master.

915
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,120
All these are common in our families.

916
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,950
Darkha Sir, you turned as a Dracula
when they hit your father

917
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,080
How should you turn when they
hit a Dracula now?

918
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,950
They should be burned into ashes

919
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:33,500
Not turning to ashes but we should
finish that Pulla Reddy

920
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,450
That anyways is fixed.

921
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,620
But, what to do with that man who
diverted this onto you?

922
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,950
This looks like a personal
revenge - You shut up.

923
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:42,330
Arrange all items in double dose and we
shall finish even that guy.

924
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,200
Ok Master.

925
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,700
One more small matter -Tell me.

926
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,200
Pooja.

927
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,450
I don’t do normal prayers(Pooja)
other than the black magic.

928
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,330
This isn’t that Pooja (Prayer) master,
but about my Pooja.

929
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,000
You go straight to her and say
what’s in your heart.

930
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,250
He may not be able to bear if she
says the words of heart.

931
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,290
Hey Chetan Sharma,

932
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,200
both your language and body language
have changed after Pulla Reddy

933
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
made you the President.

934
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,450
You pass satires on me, rascal?

935
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,830
Nothing as such Sir, I became the
President with your blessings.

936
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,200
I’m unable to bear this one dude. You
stop and you say master.

937
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,750
Mr. Paul - Tell sir.

938
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,450
Go and tell tomorrow morning at
7:32 and 45 seconds.

939
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:26,200
Master, there. She is the one

940
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,700
I’m coming baby - See the time idiot.

941
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,200
Hey, babe... your looking fab.

942
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,250
Come out with me, I’ll show
you a good time.

943
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,620
Trust me.

944
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,250
Trust me baby! Sweety!

945
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,950
Trust me - Come on Sweety, trust us.

946
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:47,870
Trust me

947
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,870
Trust me - Trust us.

948
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,330
Trust me - Trust us.

949
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:52,080
Trust me - Trust us.

950
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,370
Trust me baby - Trust us.

951
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,250
Trust me -Trust us only

952
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,870
Trust me -Trust us.

953
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:03,580
Trust me - Trust us.

954
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,580
Ok Master, bless me

955
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,750
Kshmora blesses you

956
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:06,950
See you, master blaster - Go, beat it.

957
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Trust us.

958
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,500
Trust me -Trust us.

959
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:18,000
Paul sir..! when I am asking him to fix
her up. why is she hitting them.

960
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,700
The idiot’s down, oh no!

961
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:22,700
Oh no...!

962
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,200
Master, master!

963
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,950
Master is gone! Jeez!

964
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:53,750
Why do you hold me Master? - Oh no!

965
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,250
Why did you fear and come back, master?

966
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,870
I came back with a fear that I
may reverse back.

967
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,000
But you said this was a good time? - That
is as per the Indian time.

968
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,250
It’s all different here, right?

969
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,200
You should take care of that in advance,
right?

970
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,120
You stay here, right?
You should take care

971
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,750
Correct Master.

972
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,000
Something bad is come into her -
What to do then, Master?

973
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,700
Let her go and look for another girl

974
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,700
No compromise Master.

975
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,200
Comparing with the plusses of her, this
is a very small minus.

976
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,700
I’ll make this minus to plus and fix up
only to her.

977
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,330
Just give your
blessings and rest is history

978
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,080
Do whatever but follow
India time this time

979
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,700
Ok Master, master blaste -
Dakhra blesses you.

980
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,950
Oh my God, did I behave so violently?
-It’s really scary Pooja.

981
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,700
You must consult a psychiatrist.

982
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,540
I studied deep, enquired allover net,
enquired all,

983
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,700
researched for who is the best and...

984
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,620
Come to the point

985
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,250
Sorry dear.

986
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,620
I found the greatest Psychiatrist in
the entire Solar system.

987
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,080
Not just in America but he has
branches even in Europe.

988
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,200
And he being in New York now is luck.

989
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,120
But getting the appointment today
itself is my effort.

990
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,080
Why trouble for you? - Love on
co-Telugu people.

991
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,450
You don’t think of anything else. His
appointment is very precious.

992
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,080
And your situation is very dangerous.

993
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,870
Everything will be set, he is a great Doc.

994
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,750
All are in the same expression,
who’s the patient?

995
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,080
We’ll say who’s the patient later, but
say who are you first.

996
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,500
I’m Antony, Dr. Mark Antony.

997
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,830
Sir, we all know that you are Akbar
and enough of the dramas

998
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
Who’s Akbar?

999
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,370
I’m Dr. Antony, MD, MPA, FRCPF.

1000
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,700
Can’t you see the board?

1001
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,950
Dr. Mark Antony, you think
it’s a double role?

1002
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,870
Will there be a double role in real life?
- Aren’t fight masters Ram-Lakshman there?

1003
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:34,580
Yes.

1004
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,950
Still, I won’t believe till I test.

1005
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:36,950
Relax.

1006
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,450
Her name is Theresa, Mother Theresa.

1007
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,450
Oh, nice name. Relax!

1008
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:44,700
Her name isn’t Theresa but Pooja

1009
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,450
Then why did you say Theresa?

1010
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,950
I lied

1011
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,830
It’s guaranteed that he
will get a slap now.

1012
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:51,700
I cheated on a purpose

1013
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:56,700
Relax, it’s for a purpose right? We too
lie often as a part of treatment.

1014
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,370
I’m strong, you’re strong and
we’re all strong.

1015
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,620
Relax!

1016
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,950
You say he’s really a Doctor - He isn’t
Akbar as you’re still alive.

1017
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,950
Correct.

1018
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,700
That Akbar used to always be on fire
saying he will chase and beat us up.

1019
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:12,620
But this guy is saying relax and talking
to me by making me sit in recliner.

1020
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:13,750
Doctor... - Yes.

1021
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,700
Let me be truthful, she’s the patient.

1022
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,160
She’s really a person like Mother Theresa

1023
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,500
but yesterday she suddenly behaved like
a Martial Arts fighter.

1024
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,450
Pooja, please show him the video.

1025
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,580
Imagine Sir, I saw in live.

1026
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,000
Extremely painful and you have to
fix it Sir, please.

1027
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,000
Relax!

1028
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:36,830
I need to talk to the patient.

1029
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:37,330
Okay.

1030
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:38,620
Can you both wait outside?

1031
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:39,950
How long to wait dude?

1032
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
What do I know Sir. -That's why you
are called half mental...

1033
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,120
If you say will it happen.?

1034
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,700
Excuse me.

1035
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:44,700
Sorry.

1036
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,830
Doctor is calling you inside.

1037
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,450
She has a problem called
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

1038
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,250
Is it like in 'Aparichutudu' movie,
Doctor?

1039
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,330
Exactly!

1040
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,580
But not exactly

1041
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,080
It’s not that all do behave like that.

1042
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,450
In this case this girl is behaving
something violently.

1043
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:08,330
Nothing to worry, it’s curable.

1044
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,580
Thank you Doctor.

1045
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,500
In fact, Doctor should thank me.

1046
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,870
Why should I say thank you?

1047
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,330
Because of me you got this patient and are
getting the fees, right?

1048
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,830
The Problem you have is bigger than what
she has - What’s that Sir?

1049
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,580
If she has Identity disorder, he
has Identity Crisis.

1050
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,950
What are the symptoms of that, Doctor?

1051
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,370
Saying everything is because of him and
when it fails to push the blame on others.

1052
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,700
Cruel thoughts inside and
positive Tweets outside.

1053
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:33,080
I stubbornly tell you Doctor...
you are a Doctor.

1054
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,250
In fact, you too have a problem

1055
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,450
Karma is a bitch! you tell Doctor.

1056
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,370
Low IQ.

1057
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You said it correctly Doctor.

1058
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,000
He is half minded, what are
the symptoms Doctor?

1059
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:45,870
Roaming around the wrong people
and to believe frauds.

1060
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,580
Correct Doctor, I admit

1061
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,580
You shut it.

1062
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,950
What is Pooja’s treatment now, Doctor?

1063
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,370
She needs some meditation and therapy.

1064
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:57,120
For a violent girl to become silent,
she has to fall in love.

1065
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,830
But Doctor, I’m already in love with her
- One side love Doctor.

1066
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,700
You do one thing, I asked her to
wait in Mediation room

1067
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,000
You go and say words from your heart
straight without any nonsense.

1068
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,830
Sure Doctor, it’s high time.

1069
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,830
I hope both of your
problems will be solved.

1070
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:15,870
I’m strong, you’re strong and -
We all are strong.

1071
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,200
Relax!

1072
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:23,950
See Pooja...

1073
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:29,080
I thought of saying this right at WATA. And
due to some unforseen circumstances, I couldn’t.

1074
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,200
That's why I’m waiting to say the word in
my heart from five and half days.

1075
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,200
I too am wishing to tell you
something from long back.

1076
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,370
Oh, fantastic.

1077
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,950
Then, we shall go one by one.
You please start

1078
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,330
I’m in love with a man.

1079
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,500
Oh my God.

1080
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,870
Who’s he? - I don’t know.

1081
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,080
Where does he stay? - I don’t know

1082
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,620
Rubbish.

1083
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,450
You don't who he is, where he stays and
loving an underground fellow like that

1084
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,830
makes no god damn sense, dear.

1085
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:52,950
Any random person will tell that.

1086
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,830
Smiling Doctor told me to convey this.

1087
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,450
So,listen peacefully and calmly
without interrupting.

1088
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:58,450
I love you.

1089
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,950
Yes, I love you.

1090
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,370
If you say ok, I’ll keep you in flowers
lifelong and take care.

1091
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:07,830
Sunday Jasmines, Monday Roses, Tuesday
Tulips and bla bla bla...

1092
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,000
All I’m expecting from you
is mutual trust!

1093
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:14,750
Yes, please trust me.

1094
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,500
I beg you to trust me,

1095
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,450
because it is all about the trust.

1096
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,450
Trust is a must. Must is the best, so
automatically trust is the best.

1097
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,580
So don’t adjust.

1098
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,700
Just trust,

1099
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:26,750
Trust...

1100
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,200
Trust...

1101
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:29,080
Trust...

1102
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,450
Will you Pooja?

1103
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,950
Oh no, what are those wounds? Sir,
what happened?

1104
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,370
That smiling Doctor will ask the same
question

1105
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,950
And you can enjoy
listening to that time.

1106
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,450
They hit you like a mad dog. Who is it?

1107
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,330
You can’t wait, right? - Come on Sir.

1108
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,200
I can see you, dude - No, no.

1109
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:03,950
Mr. Chanti, what happened? - Again, smile

1110
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,370
No situation can affect you.
I’ll narrate Doctor.

1111
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:08,950
I went inside.

1112
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,370
Success.

1113
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,000
What success, Doctor? It’s
a total disaster.

1114
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
No Mr. Chanti, think cool

1115
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,120
She said there’s guy in her heart.

1116
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,450
But she says don’t know where
he’s and who he’s.

1117
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,500
So, if we trace him out,
problem is solved.

1118
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,000
Tracing him out, their problem gets solved
and how’ll my problem be solved Doctor.

1119
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,200
No, no...you’re not getting
my point Chanti.

1120
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,120
Suppose, if he’s married already...

1121
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:41,330
We can say he’s married, pull him out of
her heart and push you inside.

1122
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,950
How would we know where he is, Doctor?

1123
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,200
From now onwards, that
should be your mission.

1124
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,500
Your work is to search and trace him out.

1125
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,750
I’m strong, you’re strong and

1126
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,580
We all are strong. - We all are strong.

1127
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,200
Relax!

1128
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:10,950
Chidamabaram, look at this.

1129
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,580
The ring is missing again.

1130
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:14,620
Yes Sir.

1131
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:19,080
In the CC camera footage we got, we’ve the
visual of Akbar saving Vikram Talwar.

1132
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,000
You’re right.

1133
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,950
In fact even Vikram called
and told this to me.

1134
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,620
Bomb blasts are on at the Central Park. I
just met with an accident also.

1135
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,450
But luckily Akbar saved my life.

1136
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,500
Catching this Akbar, we may get some clue.

1137
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,000
Vikram Talwar’s sins got
ripened and he died.

1138
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,370
You should be careful dear.

1139
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:19,540
That’s why uncle, I changed the name
Aishwarya,

1140
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,620
Which all at our house like and
am living with the identity Pooja.

1141
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:25,830
Call me as and when you have any need,
dear.

1142
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:27,500
Ok uncle.

1143
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,080
Hello... Morning.

1144
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,450
Doctor...

1145
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,250
Doctor... -Hey, Chanti relax.

1146
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,750
How to relax Doctor, when it’s
going so bad there?

1147
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:35,620
What happened?

1148
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,580
Pooja is gone to Times Square.

1149
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,950
Let her go and what will go bad from that?
-She’s gone alone.

1150
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,700
It seems she said not to
return till evening.

1151
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,370
That means the stranger will
come there for sure.

1152
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:44,200
Come on, let us go. -Why me?

1153
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,620
You only told that you will remove that
guy and push me in, right?

1154
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,200
To remove him, you should see him right?

1155
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:48,950
Yes, correct.

1156
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:51,080
Come on then, how can you be so cool Sir?
- Relax, relax my boy.

1157
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:15,830
Why do you look around, look there.
There is the beauty

1158
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,910
If Pooja is having such a sad face,

1159
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,330
definetly it means she is waiting for
the undercover stranger.

1160
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:19,950
Maybe.

1161
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,120
What maybe, it must be.

1162
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,830
You should somehow take him out from
that heart and push me in.

1163
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,080
I’ll try. - You better.

1164
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,000
You keep focusing and I’ll get
you a cappuccino.

1165
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,830
Dad...

1166
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:01,450
Hey Aishu... -Jallal.

1167
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:50,620
You four from now are 20% share
holders in this Company

1168
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,080
Tomorrow’s my son Amar’s birthday.

1169
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:55,620
We’re having a party at home.
We’re all a family now.

1170
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,250
If the bosses come to know facts about us,
then it's danger.

1171
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:10,200
We should start the story only
after we write the end.

1172
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,870
We’re already 20% share
holders in the Company.

1173
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:17,330
From now, 100% is ours.

1174
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:18,620
How...?

1175
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,950
Entire Fido family is going to be finished
in tomorrow’s birthday party.

1176
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:42,580
Happy birthday... Happy birthday to you.

1177
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,450
Has Aishu become more than me to you,
right?

1178
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,580
These uncles are our family
members from today.

1179
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,290
Like I, Sanju uncle and Jalal uncle have,

1180
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:00,580
even these uncles should have Fido
rings in their hands.

1181
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,700
May God bless you Prince!

1182
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,250
Hey Lucky, wait up.

1183
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Lucky come back here! Lucky
come back here!

1184
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,200
Bad boy, Lucky...

1185
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,870
Stay! Come here.

1186
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:54,870
Mom!

1187
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,580
Dad!

1188
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,620
Mom!

1189
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,620
I went to WATA on September 17th.

1190
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,330
Where was I on 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st?

1191
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,330
I killed Vikram Talwar on 22nd.

1192
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,080
Again what happened to me
on 23rd and 24th?

1193
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,000
What exactly is happening to me?

1194
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,330
Tomorrow is 25th.

1195
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:27,950
Dad’s birthday!

1196
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,250
I should go to Greenwoods
Cemetery and pay homage.

1197
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,700
It has to happen.

1198
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,830
Nothing should happen to me again by then.

1199
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:36,450
It has to happen.

1200
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,830
You spoke the deal to save us three.

1201
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,450
Vikram Talwar died.

1202
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,950
Amar! He seems to be a man eater

1203
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,450
I’m a tiger hunter - What’ve you done?

1204
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:52,080
Why blabbering as tiger hunter when
they’re so angry Sir?

1205
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:52,950
Shut up.

1206
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,200
Tomorrow is 25th September.

1207
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:59,080
Maybe you forgot, I didn’t forget.

1208
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,620
Tomorrow is Anand Prasad’s birthday,
right?

1209
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,950
That Amar hunting you all in
such organized way,

1210
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:08,120
He will definitely come to Greenwoods
Cemetery to pay homage.

1211
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,080
He will definitely fall in my trap.

1212
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,620
It’s confirmed.

1213
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:38,750
Guys, when FBI wants to nab some one, they
will get every emotional info.

1214
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:42,080
They set a trap and each connection you
got they go for every details.

1215
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,080
Watch out you will be seen.

1216
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:18,580
God Damn!

1217
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,830
Only our family knows that Anand
uncle likes roses.

1218
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:16,200
That means Amar!

1219
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,700
Happy birthday uncle.

1220
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:24,370
I’m waiting for Amar.

1221
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:26,950
Bless that we meet soon.

1222
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,080
Kharge - Hello, tell me.

1223
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:32,950
Have you got him?

1224
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,080
I’m very close by Sir.
Definitely I’ll catch him

1225
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,370
Kill that bugger and tell me.

1226
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,200
I’ll come and see his bloody face.
-Where are you Sir?

1227
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,580
I am at columbus circle
waiting in the car.

1228
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,250
Sir, he just got missed. -It’s me
who just got missed.

1229
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:13,080
If this car wasn’t bullet proof, I
would’ve been dead.

1230
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,870
Go and get that Idiot! - Yes Sir

1231
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,830
Doctor, what happened Doctor?

1232
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,200
Akbar, right?

1233
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:46,580
He isn’t Akbar, but Antony. Dr. Antony!

1234
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:47,870
Is it?

1235
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,500
Both look alike.

1236
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,450
look alikes

1237
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,580
But I’m Pooja and he’s my Doctor.

1238
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,120
Excuse me...

1239
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:57,450
Doctor, can I talk to you for one
second please. -Yeah.

1240
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,330
Akbar, Antony!

1241
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:06,200
Amar, Akbar and Antony!

1242
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,250
There’s something fishy

1243
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:13,330
Actually Doctor, about my problem...
with you in detail.

1244
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:16,450
Doctor!

1245
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:18,080
Doctor!

1246
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:25,870
Who would have placed the second bouquet?

1247
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:28,370
Damn! I missed him.

1248
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,330
Even they influenced FBI.

1249
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:33,000
On another hand, something
is happening to me.

1250
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,870
I’m not totally perfect.

1251
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,080
Why’s there the second bouquet?

1252
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,580
Who put this?

1253
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:41,950
Amar, Akbar, Antony!

1254
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,120
Is it just a rhyme?

1255
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,120
Or is there a relation also?

1256
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:49,200
I don’t understand what’s happening to me
and how it is happening.

1257
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:09,580
Why did Amar after listening to the glass
breaking sound turn as Akbar?

1258
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,500
We’re all strong.

1259
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,700
Why did Amar change to Antony after
seeing the psychic patient?

1260
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,250
Amar, what's happen?

1261
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,950
I’m not Amar but Antony. Dr. Antony.

1262
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,620
And what’s wrong with my dress?
I’m looking funny.

1263
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,330
The reason for turning back to Amar after
hearing the bomb blast sound,

1264
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,500
Is Dissociative Identity Disorder.

1265
01:13:57,950 --> 01:14:02,000
There is a strong reason for Amar to have
got this psychic problem.

1266
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,620
Some girl is thinking I am Dr Antony.

1267
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,450
The FBI officer called me Akbar.

1268
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,950
Why...? what is happening?

1269
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:14,500
However big criminal you maybe, whatever
powerful your revenge maybe ...

1270
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:20,120
You can't escape from this FBI
officer Balwant Kharge.

1271
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:24,580
It’s not the manpower around us which
saves us from the real danger,

1272
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,950
but our strength within.

1273
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,080
I haven’t forgotten what you said, uncle

1274
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:32,200
Whatever strong maybe the enemy and
whatever maybe my weaknesses,

1275
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:36,080
they can’t escape from my
stubborn will to kill them.

1276
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:55,900
Brother, one plate of this, that,
that one and that

1277
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,480
All are for him only - Yes.

1278
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,730
Must be hungry for a month.

1279
01:14:58,770 --> 01:14:59,850
Ghost Bless.

1280
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:00,980
What’s he saying?

1281
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,730
He said stomach will blast
eating all those.

1282
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,980
He said it or you added? - He said Sir.

1283
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,600
They would feel happy when customers come
but won’t pass satires.

1284
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:08,980
Oh no Pulla Reddy Sir - Sweets?

1285
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,770
No, my husband - When did you marry him?

1286
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:12,850
Come on smile

1287
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,850
Good morning Sir - What about my accounts?

1288
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,270
We’re at the financier on
the same job Sir.

1289
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,650
We’ll repay slowly even by
mortgaging our properties

1290
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,980
Not slowly but fast. You just
have four days time.

1291
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,350
Ok Sir, see you.

1292
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:26,980
You said that Pulla Reddy will vomit
blood and die in three days.

1293
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,020
Why’s he still not dead?

1294
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,020
What shall I do? - Then who will do?

1295
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,100
Paul Sir - Sorry Sir.

1296
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,350
There’s some fault in the
material you brought.

1297
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,150
Fault? - Yes.

1298
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,600
Impossible, I got them as it is.

1299
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,020
Say what you brought once.

1300
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,600
Ghee of the cow born to Ongole bull
and the Punganur cow.

1301
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:41,770
Stop there, fault is right there

1302
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:42,900
What did I say?

1303
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,850
Ghee of cow born to Punganur
bull and Ongole cow

1304
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:48,150
Why do you blame me with
mistakes at your end?

1305
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:52,100
Hey man, record whatever he says and send
it to that Guntur guy in WhatsApp.

1306
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,480
If not he would say fault is in the flour.

1307
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,980
Why would I say anything if you bring
everything correctly, waste rascal?

1308
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,520
It means it is beautiful? -Why is the
food not coming still?

1309
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:04,900
You spent whole childhood happily with
people all around you.

1310
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,600
I feel bad seeing you live alone now,
dear.

1311
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,980
I’m living with the confidence that
happiness would also return

1312
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:14,270
along with Amar, uncle.

1313
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:19,020
I’m still unable to forget the
incidents that took place.

1314
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,850
Hey Jalal, please bring a bottle dude
- No, you’re already high.

1315
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,230
Kids are still playing

1316
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,770
Just for today dude.

1317
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:28,730
Please get it

1318
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:29,480
Okay.

1319
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,980
Hey Lucky, wait up

1320
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:34,270
Amar, wait for me

1321
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:37,100
Lucky.

1322
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,350
Amar.

1323
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,270
Saboo, can we go ahead?

1324
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,480
Yeah, we are safely away.

1325
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:47,150
Ok! One blast is enough.

1326
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,850
Fire accidents happen more in this
season due to the heaters.

1327
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,600
We kept the gift packs we got
just beside them.

1328
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:55,730
There are four Gasoline packets in them

1329
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,850
In fact, one is enough to bring
the entire house down

1330
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,980
Not even one would be left behind,
trust me

1331
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:07,900
Lucky.

1332
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,600
Mom, dad!

1333
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:18,980
Oh God.

1334
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:19,850
what happened?

1335
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:21,400
Amar.. Amar.

1336
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,850
Hey Sanjay! - Dad

1337
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,350
Aishu...

1338
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,480
Mom - Dad.

1339
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,100
Mom...

1340
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:30,150
Oh Damn!

1341
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:38,480
If you tell them, we’ll kill all of you

1342
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:45,020
We don't have anyone now, uncle.
What will do now..?

1343
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:50,730
It isn’t the manpower that saves us
when in real danger...

1344
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,770
but it is the strength within us.

1345
01:17:53,480 --> 01:18:00,850
Seeing a house so calm now, which till
yesterday was so playful,

1346
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,980
we feel very sad Jalal Sir.

1347
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:08,770
They always helped if possible but
never harmed anyone.

1348
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,980
Not understanding why this
happened to them.

1349
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,270
Are you missing mom and dad?

1350
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,350
You know one thing? - What uncle?

1351
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:25,980
All those dead live in that forest. You
can see them if you go there.

1352
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:27,980
Really uncle?

1353
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,650
Yes, trust me. Go

1354
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:31,850
Aishwarya!

1355
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,350
Aishu!

1356
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,650
Aishu!

1357
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:36,480
Aishu!

1358
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:37,770
Aishwarya!

1359
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,350
Did you see Aishwarya?

1360
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:43,400
I saw someone going towards the forest.
It may be Aishwarya

1361
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,730
That is a hunting area. There
would even be Coyotes.

1362
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:51,600
Mom!

1363
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,230
Dad!

1364
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,480
Baby Aishu! - Aishu

1365
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,980
Aishu

1366
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,350
Aishu

1367
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,600
Mom! Dad!

1368
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:20,020
Are you ok?

1369
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,100
Yes - Let’s go.

1370
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:24,230
Hey Aishu, why did you come
here alone dear?

1371
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:25,770
Uncle...

1372
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:31,230
If you tell him, I will kill you all.

1373
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:48,730
We cut the trees easily.

1374
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:51,150
It’s taking time to pluck out the plants.

1375
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,980
I like this comparison.

1376
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:58,350
Plants absorb poisonous gas
and give Oxygen

1377
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:05,020
Plants above absorb Carbon monoxide we
exhale and give properties we need.

1378
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:09,600
It takes 10 minutes to die for elders.

1379
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:13,850
Five minutes is more than
enough as they are kids.

1380
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,980
Amar! Aishu!

1381
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:25,350
Hey Amar, open the door.
Open the door please.

1382
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,230
Aishu! Aishu, open the door please

1383
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:33,400
Aishu!

1384
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,100
Amar!

1385
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:38,400
Amar! Amar!

1386
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,850
Hey, get up. Amar, get up

1387
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,520
Amar... -I’m ok uncle.

1388
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,230
Get up Amar.

1389
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:44,350
Aishu

1390
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,480
Aishu... Aishu.

1391
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,980
Aishu... Aishu, are you ok?

1392
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,350
Come on get up, come on run. - Aishu.

1393
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,350
come on run.

1394
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:54,520
Come dear, fast.... fast.

1395
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:04,730
Come on fast.

1396
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:10,480
Amar.

1397
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,400
Stop... Stop.

1398
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,900
Damn it! Get the vehicle

1399
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,980
Is it those who killed our parents too?

1400
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,270
Yes Amar, I’ve seen.

1401
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,730
He threatened to kill all if I say.

1402
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,100
That's why I didn’t say.

1403
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:56,350
We shouldn’t leave anyone of them, uncle.

1404
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,150
We’re not leaving but postponing.

1405
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,850
Right now my responsibility
is to save you.

1406
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,850
We’re going to Detroit.

1407
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:07,230
At any cost, none should know who we are.

1408
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,730
Don’t tell anyone about our details.

1409
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:40,770
Make it quick

1410
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:47,850
Uncle, coffee...

1411
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:50,980
Uncle, coffee...

1412
01:22:58,150 --> 01:22:59,850
It’s better if all those who
gave me loans are dead.

1413
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,600
I’m unable to freely roam outside.

1414
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,650
Oh no! Looks like all the loan givers
formed a syndicate.

1415
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:08,480
Why did I
get caught like this?

1416
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,150
You didn’t expect to get caught, right?

1417
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:11,810
Hey Bobby idiot, if you don’t pay us all

1418
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:14,980
today I’ll get you beaten to
scrap and push you in.

1419
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:15,850
Hey Sai, take off your hands

1420
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:18,100
What rascal, raising on those
who gave you loans?

1421
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,600
This car is mine - Yours?

1422
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:20,480
If not yours?

1423
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,020
Without finance, I took a
debt and bought it.

1424
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,100
Huh, why do we care about how you bought
it? What is our situation?

1425
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:27,020
That’s why I’m saying to sell this,

1426
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:30,600
Share amongst for the loans and
send me the balance.

1427
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:31,400
Take - Thanks.

1428
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,400
Huh, who needs your thanks? Give me 2000

1429
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,100
For what?

1430
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:35,980
You want me to go by walk?
It’s for cab expenses.

1431
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,650
Hey no need, my mind is changing.
Give me my keys back.

1432
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:40,850
Hey, wait dude. Here, take it.

1433
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,600
It gives great mileage dude.
I’m feel like crying.

1434
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,230
It’s bad time and let go the car.

1435
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:49,150
Hey Sai, it’s like winning World cup with
Zimbabwe team

1436
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,600
To collect the debt from Bobby.

1437
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:51,270
Yes dude.

1438
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:55,270
Hey, this key isn’t of this car - Oh no,
Bobby cheated us again.

1439
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:55,900
Hey, come on guys.

1440
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,770
These idiots don’t even have the sense not
to run in this Times Square.

1441
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:00,650
See Sai, how is he running? His heart
would stop and die, idiot.

1442
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,400
Hey, who are you?

1443
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:08,230
Sir, you look to be a Telugu man,
please help me Sir.

1444
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:10,100
Who are all those? - Who gave me loans Sir

1445
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,850
My name is Bobby, Sir. I’m an
illegal immigrant.

1446
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,770
I’ve a strength and weakness.

1447
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:15,400
What are they?

1448
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,100
I take loan from all within 10
minutes of introduction.

1449
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:20,520
I spend it all within 5 minutes after I
get the loan in the casino.

1450
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,600
With this rare combination one Lakh
Dollars of debt

1451
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,150
And 100 debtors have accumalated.

1452
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:29,100
My passport is in mortgage and
future is in risk.

1453
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:32,600
I’m penny less, homeless,
hopeless and jobless

1454
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:33,850
I’ll give you the job

1455
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,100
Thank you Sir

1456
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:36,850
What’s that Sir? - Babysitter

1457
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,900
Who’s the baby, Sir? - Myself

1458
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:41,900
How can you be a baby Sir? - I
have a peculiar problem.

1459
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:45,230
You should observe me 24/7 and say
what’s happening to me

1460
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:47,350
I’ll pay you one Lakh Dollars if
you do that correct.

1461
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:50,850
Brother! You should know what’s
happening to you, right?

1462
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,270
I’ll show it direct to your eyes.

1463
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,150
If you take a left there, I’ll push in my
luggage and it’s light weight.

1464
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,900
Oh no, lift direct into the flat?

1465
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,980
It’s very spacious. How much would it be?

1466
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,850
Everything is open for you, except that
room - What’s in that room Sir?

1467
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,230
Sorry Sir

1468
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,980
I’ll freshen up and come, then we can have
dinner together.

1469
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,350
Aren’t there no
drinks before dinner Sir?

1470
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,100
As you wish

1471
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,230
Sir is too rich...

1472
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:16,730
but no use. He needs my support like
Sasikala for Jayalalitha

1473
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,480
God has shown me a way and I
shouldn’t misuse this.

1474
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,850
What’s happening to him and what’s
there in that room?

1475
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,600
I should pull out everything during drinks
time and backstab him genuinely.

1476
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,060
Please be seated Sir.

1477
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,400
This is my favorite brand Sir. I’ve been
thinking to have this from so long.

1478
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,100
Have it Bobby.

1479
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:30,980
Enough Bobby

1480
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,150
Everything is ruined after these
idiotic diets have come up

1481
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:35,600
We should eat, drink and
enjoy to the fullest.

1482
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:36,600
Cheers

1483
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:41,520
What’s happening to you exactly Sir?

1484
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,600
Knowing that is your job

1485
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:45,980
I need some details about you for me
to get into the job, Sir

1486
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:46,520
Ask.

1487
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,100
Your name - Amar.

1488
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,850
Flash back - I won’t say

1489
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,850
Ok, say about your likes.
Your favorite food?

1490
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,020
Loose dal, potato fry and cup cakes

1491
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,980
Favorite movie - Brave Heart.

1492
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:00,100
So, he likes revenge.

1493
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:01,900
Favorite Hero - Brad Pit.

1494
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:04,150
I got some information.

1495
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:06,850
If you cooperate like this, we...
Sorry Sir, Sorry.

1496
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:08,730
I will be back sir, I will clean it.

1497
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:19,480
Huh! This is the problem with these glass
bottles, they break when they fall down.

1498
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:21,270
They say plastic is cancer.

1499
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,480
Steel bottles are better though
they are expensive.

1500
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:27,520
It’s like bottle didn’t break at all and
looks neater than before Sir.

1501
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:28,770
Who are you?

1502
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,400
I’ve got none other than the debtors Sir.

1503
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,520
Hey, who are you rascal? - It’s me Sir,
Bobby

1504
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:34,650
Bobby - Yes.

1505
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,230
Why am I here and what’s this dress?

1506
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:40,480
Why is he talking differently? - Tell
me Bobby, why am I here?

1507
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,100
You are in your house - Is this my house?

1508
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:46,980
Being over drunk, this idiot is
thinking his house is mine.

1509
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:49,600
He forgot his own house just with one peg.

1510
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,480
Let me get him fully drunk, then I can
drive him out and loot the house.

1511
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,150
Bobby, say one thing.

1512
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,230
What’s the connection between you and me?

1513
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:57,600
Friends

1514
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:59,650
Is Bobby Akbar’s friend?

1515
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:00,600
Yes.

1516
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,730
Then, you first said Sir - Not Sir,
but I said sorry.

1517
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:05,730
You forgot.

1518
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:08,730
You come to my house for party and
drink less? Have it dude

1519
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:12,150
Pour it dude - You pour,
don’t you have hands?

1520
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:12,900
Pour it.

1521
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,650
Pour as much you wish to.

1522
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:16,020
He has taken such a large peg.

1523
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,730
Drink it, drink. Drink full and die.

1524
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,850
Where is Achar (pickle), dude?
- Who is Achar?

1525
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:30,230
Achar... Pickle, for munching
- It’s broken dude.

1526
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,350
There would be glass pieces and you
shouldn’t eat. You’ll die.

1527
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,150
I’m not getting sleep... If you
leave fast, I’ll sleep

1528
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:39,520
Ok, you sleep dude

1529
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:41,900
Go man, don’t come back again

1530
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:48,230
He’s gone. I’ll loot everything
and shift to Vegas.

1531
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,520
I’ll go around all the casinos. Will I
leave the strip ball or what?

1532
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:55,480
Las Vegas, be ready!

1533
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,100
Why is he coming back?

1534
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:58,230
Hey...

1535
01:27:58,850 --> 01:27:59,850
Why did you come back again?

1536
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,600
I got a doubt - What doubt?

1537
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:04,230
Is there a friendship in between us
for real? - Yes dude

1538
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:08,850
Looking at your side look and breath, my
brain says - What does it say?

1539
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:11,600
You’re saying a lie and are cheating

1540
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:13,230
I get hurt if you say so

1541
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:15,350
You know about me, right? - Is it?

1542
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,900
You too know about me? - A to Z...

1543
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:19,230
You just said right?

1544
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:21,520
What’s my full name? - Amar

1545
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,230
Akbar.

1546
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:26,100
I asked for full name - Full name?

1547
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:27,600
Jodha Akbar?

1548
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:29,850
Jalal Akbar... Usmed Jalal Akbar...

1549
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:31,650
Mohammed Bin Usmed Jalal Akbar!

1550
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:32,350
Stop it!

1551
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,600
Looks like your parents gave such a
big name just to hit me

1552
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,480
This Akbar will not accept a lie and
doesn’t excuse the cheating.

1553
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,480
Then what will you do?

1554
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,480
I’ll strip and bash up.

1555
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,480
No need, I’m saying the truth.
This is your house Sir

1556
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,980
Is this my house?

1557
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:47,900
Does Akbar stay here?

1558
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,770
No, Amar stays - Amar.

1559
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:51,230
Who’s Amar?

1560
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:53,730
Why do you ask who’s Amar? Akbar
has come out from Amar.

1561
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:56,020
looks like he’ll not settle
unless he has a peg

1562
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:59,480
Brother, take a break and have a peg.
- Ok, let's carry on.

1563
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:05,850
We should enjoy when we
drink and not fight.

1564
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:07,600
What else will be there other than pain.

1565
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:10,350
Don't indulge in violence,
instead be good.

1566
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,600
We’re all strong.

1567
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,020
Looking at the smile, looks like
the sadist guy is gone.

1568
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,600
We can’t believe him and
better let me check.

1569
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,850
Akbar bro, hello Sir - Who’s Akbar?

1570
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:37,400
Oh!

1571
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,230
You took a small break and
returned in a snapshot.

1572
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,900
Welcome back Amar Sir.

1573
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,600
Who’s Amar? I’m Antony, Dr. Antony

1574
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:45,850
One more again?

1575
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,850
Which type is he? Cool or cruel?

1576
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,020
Where am I?

1577
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:50,980
Where am I?

1578
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:54,270
My house... No! Your house... No!

1579
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,520
You are in the house where we live
together. Roommates!

1580
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:00,980
Oh, looks like I came for a home
visit to treat the patient.

1581
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:05,230
Relax! What’s your name? - Oh, I
didn’t tell you right?

1582
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:06,600
Did you tell to anyone else?

1583
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:08,850
I told Amar Sir and I told Akbar Sir

1584
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:11,230
Who are all those? - It’s you.

1585
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,600
Proso Pognosia

1586
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:14,600
What’s that? - Your problem

1587
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,980
It’s so problematic even to say and
what’s this problem Sir?

1588
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,020
Unable to recognize faces, you
see all faces alike.

1589
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,230
I had this problem while
watching the Chinese films.

1590
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:24,480
I normally don’t have it Sir

1591
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,730
You’re better - Is it?

1592
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:29,150
Many patients don’t accept their problems
You’re accepting your problem

1593
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,350
No way out, Doctor.

1594
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:33,150
I can report after the original comes
back, if I get to know about his tastes.

1595
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:35,480
What’s your favorite food, Doctor Sir?

1596
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,730
Chicken Sandwich.

1597
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,730
Your favorite film? - Inception.

1598
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,730
Your favorite director is
Christopher Noolan, right?

1599
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:41,480
Your right.

1600
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,480
Yes, he is the director of
that film Doctor Sir

1601
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,400
Bobby, I don’t why but I’m feeling sleepy.

1602
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,400
Place your legs on that table and sleep.

1603
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,020
You sleep well Sir, we don’t have
works now to do urgently

1604
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:55,150
He isn’t a single baby, but a triple baby

1605
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,730
Why do I care about all these?

1606
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:59,650
I should give the report in the morning
and leave taking that one Lakh Dollars.

1607
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,900
He seems to be watching some action film.
Idiot said he will sleep!

1608
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:12,600
(Music Playing in TV)

1609
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,650
What Bobby, you look so excited?
- Amar Sir?

1610
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:29,150
Yeah.

1611
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:30,480
I found out your problem.

1612
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,980
How did you plan the payment? How much
black and how much white?

1613
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:35,400
Tell me the problem first

1614
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,900
Your behaviour changes all of a sudden

1615
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,310
You act like some other person for some
time

1616
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:40,730
And again changing
into another person.

1617
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:43,350
One says he likes Brave Heart and the
other says he likes Inception.

1618
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,350
He says potato fry and this
guy says Sandwich.

1619
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:47,020
One is drinking and one doesn’t - Why so?

1620
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:47,980
Because of drink - Is it?

1621
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:48,650
I’ll prove it.

1622
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:54,480
Take it

1623
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:57,230
Will my behaviour change if I drink? -You
drink it and you’ll know it yourself.

1624
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,650
Yes, don’t get it down

1625
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,850
Nonstop...

1626
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,770
Bobby wishes hello to Akbar Sir

1627
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:09,900
Who’s Akbar?

1628
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,520
Oh! Good morning Doctor

1629
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,100
Doctor?

1630
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:16,650
You said I will change if i drink, but
how come you are changing.

1631
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:19,100
One more minute, I’ll show Sridevi.

1632
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:23,230
(Song playing in TV)

1633
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:30,230
Come on, come on, come out

1634
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,730
What an amazing actress?
Quite unfortunate!

1635
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,150
Many wrote these comments.

1636
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:35,350
Don’t you feel anything?

1637
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:36,600
I feel very sad

1638
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:39,480
Look Bobby, I know that something
is happening to me.

1639
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:41,480
But, I need to know why that is happening.

1640
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,100
That God will know - You
should be that God.

1641
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,230
You gave me such a big post? - I’ll give
even such a big payment.

1642
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,600
You should get to know what my problem is
and only I should know that...

1643
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:52,730
Payment is cut even when someone
else gets to know that.

1644
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:57,980
To lose is easy but to earn is very tough.
Very tough, very tough!

1645
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,520
Excuse me, FBI!

1646
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:05,350
Yes sir.

1647
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,150
We want to meet Dr. Antony

1648
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,480
Please come in.

1649
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,100
Are you Dr. Antony?

1650
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:20,230
Yes, I’m Dr. Antony - Then...

1651
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,400
Who’s he?

1652
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:25,650
Oh, he is Amar. A very nice guy

1653
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:27,980
How can you say? - If you allow to say...

1654
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:33,480
Doctor, Amar’s family went through great
injustice and we’re investigating that.

1655
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,730
He’ll get justice if you cooperate.
- Sure officer.

1656
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:39,730
How exactly do you know Amar?

1657
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,900
14-15 years back, when I was in Detroit

1658
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,980
when I was jogging a day, two kids were
sitting in pathetic situation.

1659
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:49,730
They seemed to be rich kids.

1660
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:52,980
They were the same even when I was
returning after my jogging.

1661
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:54,770
Don’t worry Aishu, I’m here.

1662
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,650
Hi, who are you and what
are you doing here?

1663
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:01,650
Are you waiting for someone?

1664
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:04,600
But, it isn’t safe for you to be here. Ok?

1665
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:08,230
Oh God, she’s having temperature and
she needs a treatment.

1666
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:09,230
Come on, let’s go

1667
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,100
Hey, don’t you worry. I’m a Doctor.

1668
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,850
Hey Jack, two new kids for admission.

1669
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:18,600
I would give you the details later. Is
the nursing staff there?

1670
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,980
Yes sir. -Ok, thank you.

1671
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:24,350
Who here thinks he’s strong? Not many?

1672
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,980
Who here thinks she’s strong?

1673
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,850
Good! Great!

1674
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,020
There’s nothing wrong in getting hurt.

1675
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:35,520
There’s nothing wrong in crying.
But remember one thing!

1676
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:38,480
We’re all strong!

1677
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,850
Strong.

1678
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:41,100
Strong.

1679
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:42,480
Strong.

1680
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:46,350
While it was so, I saw a
peculiar incident one day

1681
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:53,020
Asihu, let’s go. Come on - Come Aishu,
let’s play... it's fun out side.

1682
01:34:53,150 --> 01:34:54,150
Trust us.

1683
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,100
Trust us.

1684
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:57,650
Trust me!

1685
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,480
Trust me!

1686
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:02,980
Trust me!

1687
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,770
What did you say?

1688
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:10,650
Did you say trust me.

1689
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:13,900
Wait... wait... wait.

1690
01:35:22,230 --> 01:35:24,900
After studying Aishwarya deeply,
I understood that...

1691
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:28,730
She has a problem called
Dissociative Identity Disorder

1692
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:29,400
That means?

1693
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:31,350
Curiosity Sir

1694
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:36,270
Split personality or they say it as
multiple personality.

1695
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:37,980
Aishu...

1696
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:41,230
Amar from then used to take
better care of Aishwarya

1697
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,400
One day, I saw another strange incident.

1698
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,900
Hi, how are you?

1699
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:47,230
That’s nice to hear that.

1700
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,350
Today, I’d like to ask you a question.

1701
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,480
Who here thinks he’s strong?

1702
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:52,900
Not many.

1703
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:55,850
Yes, we all are strong.

1704
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:00,980
Hello, this is Dr. Antony.

1705
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:03,730
I’m expecting someone later.
I said I’ll call you back.

1706
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,100
Amar!

1707
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:07,100
What’s this?

1708
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:10,650
I’m not Amar, I’m Dr. Antony.
Don’t disturb me.

1709
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:20,850
Ok, what does that mean?

1710
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,600
I then understood that even Amar has a
dissociative Identity Disorder problem.

1711
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:35,350
When I analysed as to why even he has the
same problem,

1712
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:37,520
I realised that it is
love of Amar on Aishwarya

1713
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:42,770
Because of the strong reason to cure her,
this problem got induced even to Amar.

1714
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:45,100
But, there’s a small difference
in between these two

1715
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:47,770
Aishwarya used to suddenly behave
violently

1716
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:48,980
And come back to
normalcy very fast.

1717
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:52,730
But Amar used to adopt the characters.

1718
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:57,980
Like he adopted my character, he at times
used to adopt the character of Akbar too.

1719
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,900
He used to stay back in these characters
for some days at a stretch.

1720
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:04,100
I never understood when he would come
into which character.

1721
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:06,850
Three characters in one
person - It’s not rare

1722
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:11,230
It was found that a guy named Billy
Milligan had 24 personalities in him.

1723
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:15,600
There were those whom he knew, read about,
saw, heard and when

1724
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,600
Someone said
something are all in those.

1725
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:20,650
This is a very famous case in
the United States

1726
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:24,520
There would be some triggering points to
shift into these characters

1727
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,730
Triggering points means?

1728
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:31,480
It may be a sound or a scene or a
smell or can be a touch.

1729
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,350
There would be many reasons as such

1730
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,650
By the time I could tell Amar about the
problem he has,

1731
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:40,600
An article came in a paper
about our rehab and the charity I do.

1732
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:42,980
There were Amar and
Aishwarya’s photos in that

1733
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:46,730
That same day, a patient was
admitted in our rehab.

1734
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,650
We later understood that he wasn’t a
patient but a killer.

1735
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:24,980
Aishu!

1736
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:26,650
Aishu!

1737
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:29,230
Aishu! -Stop.

1738
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,730
Who is done it?

1739
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:32,600
There... there, over there.

1740
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,980
So, Amar who went following that
killer didn’t come back.

1741
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:43,400
Days passed and I felt very sad thinking that
even Amar would have died in his hands.

1742
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:49,600
But after 14 years when I was in Europe,
my assistant called me and said.

1743
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:52,730
She said Amar came to rehab and informed
why he didn’t come back for so long.

1744
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,520
I came to know that he underwent
punishment

1745
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:18,230
For these 14 years at Jackson
Prison for killing that killer.

1746
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,440
He donated 1 Million Dollars to our rehab
for the help

1747
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:25,520
We did to them
in their childhood.

1748
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,770
Though I was anxious to come and see Amar,

1749
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:31,520
I couldn’t come because of my
prior commitments.

1750
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,150
Unfortunate, my assistant called again

1751
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:36,230
And informed that Amar is again
behaving like me.

1752
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,480
Amar left by the time I returned.

1753
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:42,730
I felt very happy seeing grown up
Amar in CCTV footage.

1754
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:47,060
The pain for not telling Amar about the psychological
issue he had till date from his childhood,

1755
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:49,100
still remains in me.

1756
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:52,230
You are Antony and who is Akbar, Doctor?

1757
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,600
I came to know that a person named Akbar
came to rehab

1758
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,150
About two to three
times asking for Amar.

1759
01:39:58,600 --> 01:39:59,850
But I couldn’t meet him.

1760
01:40:00,230 --> 01:40:03,770
Didn’t that Akbar coming there not ask
anything about Aishwarya?

1761
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,980
They said that he just asked about Amar.

1762
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:09,520
Ok, can you please try to recollect?

1763
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,400
Did anything else happen on the
day Aishwarya died?

1764
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:15,310
Yes, the boy staying in Aishwarya’s
opposite room

1765
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:17,900
Ran away from
rehab in a fear.

1766
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,350
Can you give me his details?

1767
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,980
Oh sorry, he’s an orphan and we don’t
have details about him.

1768
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,100
Thank you Doctor, for your
time and cooperation.

1769
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:27,100
I’ll see you soon.

1770
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,850
Pleasure is mine, any time

1771
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:30,230
Chidambaram - Sir.

1772
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:33,770
We’ll get total clarity if we find out who
that Akbar is - Correct Sir

1773
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,730
How did the lamp post miss from here?

1774
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:49,400
It’s confirmed that it is Amar, who
killed Vikram Talwar.

1775
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,350
But why did Vikram say that
Akbar saved him.

1776
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,480
How did bomb blasts take
place in Central park?

1777
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,100
Go and check there.

1778
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:31,600
The person who has to kill the target
person has actually saved him.

1779
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:34,350
Fate is strange... it's difficult
to understand that.

1780
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:36,900
Are you the great man whom I saw at WATA?

1781
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:38,650
Akbar? - Yes Akbar,

1782
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:39,980
why are you running?

1783
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:40,770
Kharge -Sir.

1784
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,350
Bomb blasts are happening in Central park

1785
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:42,900
Is it?

1786
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:46,230
I just met with an accident also. But
luckily Akbar saved my life.

1787
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:48,480
Akbar whom you met in WATA? - Yes,
same guy.

1788
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,770
Come fast. - Ok Sir.

1789
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,770
Why is this in my pocket? - What is that?

1790
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:08,350
Is it you doing all these Bomb Blasts?

1791
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:14,850
The person who escaped in the last minute
has invited death again and died.

1792
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:29,980
Destiny is very strong... it is very
difficult to escape from that.

1793
01:42:41,230 --> 01:42:42,480
It's like a mystery.

1794
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,650
Sir, liquor is over at home.

1795
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:48,850
Sorry Sir

1796
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,770
Where did this Doctor disappear.

1797
01:42:51,150 --> 01:42:51,730
Doctor!

1798
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:53,150
Doctor!

1799
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:54,980
Who is this heavy person next to him.

1800
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:55,850
Smiling Doctor!

1801
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,730
Doctor, Doctor!

1802
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,520
Doctor, Doctor!

1803
01:43:00,650 --> 01:43:01,400
Does he too know?

1804
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,730
Will he ask for a share or what?

1805
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:03,520
Doctor Sir

1806
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:06,400
By chance is he Akbar?

1807
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:07,730
Does he know even that character?

1808
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:09,730
By chance, has he appointed
even this fellow?

1809
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:11,770
It’s better I clarify in advance.

1810
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,150
Let me use him.

1811
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:14,770
He’s Jackson, Michael Jackson

1812
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:15,730
Is he a patient?

1813
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:17,480
No, he is Bobby. He is with me.

1814
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:20,270
Thank God, he’s the Doctor.
He maybe a patient.

1815
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,520
Doctor, where did you go leaving behind
Pooja’s treatment and my love?

1816
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:25,350
Who is Pooja?

1817
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:28,770
Doctor, the girl I loved and who hit me
when you asked me to propose her.

1818
01:43:28,850 --> 01:43:30,850
By the way, how do you know Pooja?

1819
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:33,650
I told you that I have met her at WATA,
when I met you in the hospital.

1820
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:36,350
Being a Doctor, why so many questions like
a patient forgetting it all?

1821
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,350
There wouldn’t be so many questions, if
you give all details from start to finish.

1822
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,600
Ok Doctor, I’ll narrate you in detail.
- please...

1823
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:42,730
Look there

1824
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:54,100
Do you have that WATA footage?

1825
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:56,020
You just heard it all, right Doctor?

1826
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:58,270
Being in finance dept. are we in a
position to collect the footage?

1827
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:01,230
Ok, Pooja is an event Manager right?
Would she have it?

1828
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:01,770
Possible.

1829
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:03,350
ok, can you get her tomorrow?

1830
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,850
Ok, I’ll get Pooja along with the footage.
-Thanks.

1831
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:08,600
Amar will surely come, right uncle?

1832
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:10,480
He’ll definitely come dear.

1833
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:13,100
That God wouldn’t do more
injustice than this to you

1834
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,850
Dear, Where is my Aishwarya..?

1835
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:20,980
Uncle.

1836
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:24,020
Uncle

1837
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:29,600
Aishu, my dear - Uncle.

1838
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,600
Oh God!

1839
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:36,980
Be quiet dear. Amar... Where is Amar?

1840
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:38,730
Uncle

1841
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:42,480
Hey Aishu, why are you
going into that room?

1842
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:44,350
We all have the same room.

1843
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:46,730
Well, I like that one better
It's my room now.

1844
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:49,150
Okay. -Get yourself out, now.

1845
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:52,520
Move fast. - That’s enough.

1846
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,730
Let’s search for Amar, come on

1847
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:06,100
Amar...

1848
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:07,730
Amar...

1849
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:10,350
Amar...

1850
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:11,770
Amar...

1851
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:17,980
Amar should come at least for Aishwarya.

1852
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,770
But he didn’t come means I doubt Amar died
in the hands of that killer.

1853
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:24,480
My wish is that it shouldn’t be so.

1854
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:28,150
As per what Dr. Antony said

1855
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:31,980
Amar has a problem called
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

1856
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:34,600
And thus he behaved like Antony.

1857
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:36,100
But who is this Akbar?

1858
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:38,230
Jalal Akbar - Who is that?

1859
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:41,100
Closest to the Fido family,
like a family member.

1860
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:42,650
Now I got it.

1861
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:47,020
I understood who that person Akbar is,
whom he is adopting.

1862
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:48,650
But, there is one more issue.

1863
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:53,520
Why did Jalal Akbar coming to
rehab ask only for Amar?

1864
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:55,730
He didn’t ask at all about Aishwarya, why?

1865
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:01,350
Point number 2, who put the second bouquet
that day in the graveyard?

1866
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:05,480
Looking at individually, both look like
two different questions.

1867
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:10,230
But looking at both together,
one answers the other.

1868
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:15,350
I suspect that Aishwarya is still alive.

1869
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,480
The man we sent burnt and
killed Aishwarya.

1870
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:21,980
With that anger, Amar killed
him and went to jail.

1871
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:25,480
Mr. Saboo Menon, I’m an FBI officer.

1872
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:29,150
That day, body burnt into ashes to such an
extent that

1873
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:30,480
it was difficult to
identify the body.

1874
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,520
A boy in the opposite room went missing.

1875
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,850
Now, I’m 100% sure that all this
isn’t a coincidence.

1876
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:40,730
According to your information, 80% share
holders are still alive.

1877
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:42,350
Find them immediately.

1878
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,480
Chidambaram - Sir

1879
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:47,100
Inform Intelligence department to trace
out Jalal Akbar, immediately

1880
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:47,850
Ok Sir.

1881
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:49,900
We’re here.

1882
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:51,850
Watch your step Pooja.

1883
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:53,980
She isn’t any kid Sir. -She a kid for me

1884
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,230
He asked to prepare food and
who knows it here?

1885
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,850
Hi bro -tell me Bro.

1886
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:59,100
Sir asked to bring, right? Pooja.

1887
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:00,730
What shall I do then?

1888
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:02,600
Is Doctor Sir in, bro?

1889
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:03,730
Doctor Sir? - Yes

1890
01:47:03,770 --> 01:47:05,270
He hasn’t come from two days bro.

1891
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:06,480
I met yesterday itself, right?

1892
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,230
He’s different, right? - So, is he Akbar?

1893
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:09,770
No, he’s someone else

1894
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:11,850
What time would Doctor come?

1895
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:15,150
Doctor Sir comes not according to time
but based on the situation.

1896
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:17,600
Can we wait? - Your patience.

1897
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,100
Don’t care about him,

1898
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:22,100
he’s a mad guy

1899
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:24,480
Cooking like a lady, huh!

1900
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,400
Pooja - Yes.

1901
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,350
Poor Doctor, what would happen If he
has that food, right?

1902
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,350
True, what’s his name?

1903
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:31,400
Bobby.

1904
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:33,900
Mr. Bobby - Isn’t this good?

1905
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,150
You relax and I’ll cook.

1906
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,730
Bro, it gets septic if it pierces -
This will become septic.

1907
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:41,520
Boss, you were just saying something that

1908
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,770
Doctor comes based on situation
and not based on time.

1909
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:44,650
I didn’t understand.

1910
01:47:44,730 --> 01:47:45,730
I shouldn’t tell in a
manner you understand.

1911
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:47,350
No problem, please say how is that? - Hey,
shut up

1912
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,350
They’ll become Doctors if they studying
MBBS. How they become based on situations?

1913
01:47:49,850 --> 01:47:52,400
Oh my God, it’s blood - Apply Turmeric,
it’ll come down

1914
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,100
This is called becoming Doctor
based on situation.

1915
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,150
What, so many items and so fast?

1916
01:47:58,350 --> 01:47:59,650
See how’s the taste.

1917
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:04,350
Wow, lady finger is a wow like
Bhimavaram Abhiruchi.

1918
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,100
Trust me.

1919
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:11,730
Sambar tastes like from Kakinada
Subbaiah mess, trust me.

1920
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:18,980
Potato is a blast like from
Chaudhary Mess, trust me.

1921
01:48:20,730 --> 01:48:21,770
I said trust me right?

1922
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:23,350
Trust me

1923
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,600
Any lady would jump in joy when someone
appreciates her cooking

1924
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,770
And why do
you look so like a devil?

1925
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:29,400
Trust me, Trust me, Trust me...

1926
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:32,150
Trust me, Trust me, Trust me...

1927
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:43,980
I too had faced the same experience, Bro.

1928
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,150
It's extreamly painful.

1929
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:46,730
Come, let’s see her situation.

1930
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:48,100
Huh, why do I need about her situation?

1931
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:51,400
Not to hit again, come on let’s see - Oh
no! Has anything happened to my Vertebra?

1932
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,730
Is she relaxing or recharging?

1933
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,600
No problem! - Oh no, what’s all this?

1934
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:05,600
That means, I again...

1935
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:07,400
Damn!

1936
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:11,600
What’s happening to me? Why am I
behaving so badly?

1937
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:13,980
I should feel right? Why is she feeling?

1938
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:15,770
I’m so sorry Mr. Bobby.

1939
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:18,100
It’s ok - It’s ok madam, it happens.

1940
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,400
Oh, good morning Doctor - Good morning

1941
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,100
Hi Doctor

1942
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,850
Blue looks good on you - Oh Hi Pooja

1943
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:25,350
yeah.

1944
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,350
Did you get the footage?

1945
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:29,850
Sorry, I don’t have it and I came
to say that in person.

1946
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:30,600
It’s ok

1947
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:32,520
Hey Bobby, what happened?

1948
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:35,020
The same thing that happened to me then,
happened now to Bobby.

1949
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,770
Did you by chance misbehave?

1950
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:40,850
I behaved as it is. No idea what she felt?

1951
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:44,600
Some bad time Sir, let’s not drag about
it. Pooja prepared lunch for you Sir.

1952
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:51,480
Enough!

1953
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:16,100
Mom, this is really great.

1954
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:17,520
Aishwarya prepared them.

1955
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:25,350
Thanks, I felt like I had food
after so many years.

1956
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:26,850
I love this food,

1957
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:31,400
Especially cup cake. It reminded me of the
people who went away from me.

1958
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:37,770
I learnt all these just for a
special person I missed out.

1959
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:46,480
Those who went away from you will
definitely come back.

1960
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:49,400
I don’t have that chance. All those...

1961
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:52,230
I’m sorry.

1962
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:56,900
Everyone says time has the power
to heal any big wound.

1963
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:00,020
But few wounds won’t get healed
till the heart stops.

1964
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:05,650
I wish you get back the person and
happiness you missed.

1965
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:13,270
He promised me. He never
broke his promise.

1966
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:16,350
That confidence is keeping me alive.

1967
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:58,350
Like a dream and story, where did
you go away like that?

1968
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:06,770
I’m left behind as a statue like this,
when will you be before me?

1969
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:15,270
Your thought will never be gone
even in days or years.

1970
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:23,350
Your thought is starting every
tomorrow like the day start.

1971
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:31,980
Wherever you are, however far you are,
will you listen to me?

1972
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:48,020
Hey smile, come running, come to me
like the childhood friend.

1973
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:56,480
Hey smile, come running, come to me
like the childhood friend.

1974
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:56,230
There isn’t a place I haven’t searched for
you. There isn’t the light without you.

1975
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:04,600
There isn’t a day I forgot about you The
moment without you is hard

1976
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:12,560
For the eyes not seeing you and my dreams
filled with tears

1977
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:20,480
I’m stepping ahead
taking just your name.

1978
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,770
FIDO Group is expanding it's
operations in Russia.

1979
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:48,270
To look after establishment works,

1980
01:54:48,270 --> 01:54:52,850
Company COO and senator Mr.Saboo menon is
going to Russia for two months.

1981
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:09,980
Senator Residence.

1982
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:14,100
There are three route options for Saboo
Menon to go to the airport.

1983
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:29,100
Bobby, the place we’re going now is a
very dangerous place.

1984
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,150
More than our house?

1985
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:32,850
There will be a tall and dark guy and
he likes his mother a lot

1986
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:34,730
What’s the freshness in this?
It’s quite natural

1987
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:37,230
Unnatural thing is that he has too much
of inferiority complex.

1988
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:38,600
We shouldn’t give eye
contact to such people.

1989
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:40,230
What happens if given?
-You’ll know when given.

1990
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:41,730
What shop is this? - Toys shop

1991
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:43,230
So, its Baby’s day out.

1992
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,020
Why so much buildup for toys, Sir?

1993
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:47,400
You come inside.

1994
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:51,100
Oh no, you said toys shop and
they’re selling drugs here.

1995
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:52,400
Don’t talk, they’ll kill you.

1996
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,230
Hi... Micheal.

1997
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:55,230
Are you Amar?

1998
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:55,980
Yeah.

1999
01:55:56,230 --> 01:55:58,650
Johnson told me. What do you want, my man?

2000
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:01,600
I need some toys - Got it.

2001
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:03,850
Peter, take him down - Okay.

2002
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:04,980
Thanks. -Come.

2003
01:56:06,850 --> 01:56:10,100
Bobby, you remember right? - Very much
and I won’t look at all.

2004
01:56:11,770 --> 01:56:12,770
Select which one.

2005
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,520
New arrivals.

2006
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:22,850
Can I? -Sure.

2007
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:26,980
What about this? - This is special one.

2008
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:30,730
Any how it syncs with gadgets. - Ok!

2009
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:34,600
Hey you, what’s your name? - Bobby

2010
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:36,900
That’s great. I love that name.

2011
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:38,900
My younger son is also Bobby.

2012
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:40,770
So, what shall I do? Many
will have this name.

2013
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:43,150
Hey Bobby, my mom is talking to you.

2014
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:46,020
He says not to look and this
guy says to look.

2015
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,060
Still, for this fellow at this age

2016
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:50,980
what are these games with toys like a
kid wearing shorts?

2017
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:53,020
What, what did you say? - What did I say?

2018
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:54,980
You said Nigger and then you saw at us

2019
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:57,100
Hey, what did I say man? Why do
you talk as you wish?

2020
01:56:59,730 --> 01:57:01,150
Oh no...

2021
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:12,100
You called me Nigger.

2022
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,730
Boss, he is talking nonsense - Who?

2023
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:15,400
Amar

2024
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,100
Who’s Amar? Akbar!

2025
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:19,600
Oh no, Akbar came in and
how to get out now?

2026
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:20,900
Why did you aim gun at him?

2027
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:24,400
You came for guns. Take the guns,
pay the money and go.

2028
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,650
You said for toys, did we
come to buy guns?

2029
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:30,600
Why do I need guns bro? Selling guns is a
crime and I’ll give a Police complaint.

2030
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,730
Why do you say complaint when
we’re at the gun point?

2031
01:57:32,770 --> 01:57:37,020
Leave him, he’s a friend of Johnson. He
told me, he has a problem, let him go.

2032
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:40,600
But keep him here, he’s a funny guy

2033
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:42,350
Stay calm madam, all this
is because of you.

2034
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:43,900
Added to this you’re wearing a
shorts up to your thighs.

2035
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:44,980
You told my mom, a nigger?

2036
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:49,150
I know him, a dangerous guy.
You can kill him.

2037
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:51,060
Akbar Sir, we’ll settle if there’s
anything amongst us at home.

2038
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:52,020
Please save me dude.

2039
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:54,100
Hey go, we both have nothing to do.

2040
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:55,980
Hey, Open the door.

2041
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:59,900
Akbar! I came thinking its Baby’s day out
but this seems to be Bobby’s last day.

2042
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:00,980
Save me Akbar

2043
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:02,400
Who saves you.. Who.

2044
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:05,150
How dare you call my mom a Nigger.

2045
01:58:15,350 --> 01:58:18,600
Don’t worry guys,there was a small mishap.
Relax...Relax...Relax!

2046
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:22,350
Hey Micheal...Micheal, what’s
happening man? He’s with me

2047
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,650
He called my mother Nigger

2048
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:26,020
I said knickers sir, they didn’t suit
at all on his mother.

2049
01:58:26,230 --> 01:58:26,980
Shut up Bobby.

2050
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:28,980
Micheal, its just a misunderstanding.

2051
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:30,730
Language problem, please leave him.

2052
01:58:30,850 --> 01:58:32,730
I’m leaving him... because you say.

2053
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:33,400
Thank you

2054
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:36,150
I want my stuff - Are you sure this time?

2055
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:38,900
Sure Micheal... I need the
special one too.

2056
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:40,980
Bobby, you got to do one more thing

2057
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:43,100
I can’t do any more new things Sir.

2058
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:45,230
I’ll give you more one Lakh Dollars,
think of it

2059
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:48,350
Nothing more to think Sir, I’ll
immediately get on to duty.

2060
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:53,850
Let’s go Andrew!

2061
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:57,850
Sorry Sir, the car has flat tire and
it’ll take five minutes.

2062
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:58,850
I’ll go in that one

2063
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:00,980
Sir, that’s risky. This car is
not bullet proof.

2064
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,020
It’s ok Kharge,

2065
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:03,850
I’m late for the flight and I
don’t have a choice.

2066
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:05,520
Sir... Let’s go.

2067
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:55,480
Hello...

2068
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:24,020
Amar! Amar, he’s leaving

2069
02:00:24,230 --> 02:00:25,350
Shoot.

2070
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:29,850
What happened, Amar? Amar!

2071
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:33,020
Who’s Amar? I’m Antony, Dr. Antony

2072
02:00:33,150 --> 02:00:34,980
What is this..? why am I here..?

2073
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:37,980
Jeese... Forgotten here. come on let's go.

2074
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:39,980
Where we going..? Where we going..?

2075
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:40,730
You stay here.

2076
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:43,480
Hey hello...hello. hey, hello...hello.

2077
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:57,900
(Furnace is red and blanket is
hot..) (Song Humming...)

2078
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:00,730
(Come dear, she sings with heart as the
voice.) (Song Humming...)

2079
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:01,900
Hey, you bloody idiot!

2080
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,020
Why did you stop the car?

2081
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:05,350
Because I put sudden brake - I’m asking
why did you put brake?

2082
02:01:05,730 --> 02:01:07,400
Because I felt like
applying brake suddenly.

2083
02:01:07,730 --> 02:01:08,850
Move your car immediately

2084
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:12,480
It’s not possible to move when you ask to
move. I’ve a time and a target.

2085
02:01:12,650 --> 02:01:14,270
Target fix!

2086
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:28,020
Hey, consequences will be very serious if
you don’t move the car, I’m telling you.

2087
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:31,400
What’ll you do man? At most,
you’ll fine me right?

2088
02:01:32,230 --> 02:01:36,650
1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000? But
you won’t kill me right?

2089
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:47,350
Sir...

2090
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:48,600
Oh my God!

2091
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,480
Hey, I only shot the Senator.

2092
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:51,980
I shot the Senator.

2093
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:55,100
I shot the Senator, I shot the Senator,
I only shot the Senator.

2094
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,230
Hey, why did you kill the Senator?

2095
02:01:56,270 --> 02:01:57,730
My target is this from one year.

2096
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:00,150
Though there are 30 in the team,
entire credit goes to me

2097
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:02,350
What are you talking about?
- About the game

2098
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,350
Kill the Senator, kiss the Secretary!

2099
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:07,150
Even this title I only kept.
Entire credit goes to me.

2100
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,400
I’m talking about that murder

2101
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:15,230
This isn’t a game, This is a remote
control synchronized with that gun.

2102
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:15,730
Gun?

2103
02:02:16,350 --> 02:02:18,230
You hit with that and killed Senator.

2104
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:20,150
And moreover, you agreed to
have done it all

2105
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:22,230
I’m saying this for the
first time in my life.

2106
02:02:22,350 --> 02:02:23,480
I don’t need any credit Sir.

2107
02:02:23,650 --> 02:02:25,480
Leave me Sir, I’ll go back to my village.

2108
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:26,980
I miss my parents very badly.

2109
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:33,480
Senator Saboo menon has been shot dead by
mobile game synchronised weapon

2110
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,230
FBI are Investigating.

2111
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:40,730
It has to be known who killed
the Senator and why..?

2112
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:42,100
FBI are here.

2113
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:47,150
Bear it Bobby, bear it - Speak out I say.

2114
02:02:47,230 --> 02:02:50,350
My amount will be stopped if
Amar Sir goes to jail

2115
02:02:51,730 --> 02:02:53,150
Sir, not me Sir

2116
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:57,400
Why did you do this..? tell. - Sir,
I know and I’ll tell

2117
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:00,940
If you stand at the location I say, put
your right leg in front

2118
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:02,650
And play game in Sunlight,

2119
02:03:02,730 --> 02:03:05,480
Mars will lose in the hands of Sun and
you’ll get married. -Thank you Master.

2120
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:08,440
Chitra, it’s a surprise that all those
attending

2121
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:10,770
Senator’s murder case
enquiry are Telugu people.

2122
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,270
Hi bro...

2123
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:14,730
Mr. Kandula, can you say why
did they call you?

2124
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:16,730
It seems a hand is less
inside for gambling

2125
02:03:16,770 --> 02:03:17,600
What...?

2126
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:21,980
Sit down - I’ll sit

2127
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:25,650
Not that man, when you called for your
work, you should send the vehicle right?

2128
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:28,100
He’s Mr. Kandula and I only told that name

2129
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:29,230
He needs medicines

2130
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:31,600
But looking at him, some relief

2131
02:03:31,650 --> 02:03:32,850
For me also - You too?

2132
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:34,980
That means, you too enjoy when
someone is being hit?

2133
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:36,150
I’ll cry if stopped.

2134
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:38,900
I think all are the same. They won’t say.

2135
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:40,980
Why did you make Senator’s car tire flat?

2136
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:43,100
It isn’t important whether it’s Senator’s
car or the President’s car

2137
02:03:43,230 --> 02:03:44,770
but what’s important is whether
two sevens exist or not

2138
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:48,600
Double seven... North east
tyre is this only.

2139
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:51,980
My lucky number is 7, see dear. See

2140
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:02,980
Why did you do that..? come on tell.
-I’ll say sir, I’ll say

2141
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:06,350
Hey Kandula, bad time is running for you.
-Oh no...

2142
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:08,020
Look for any car with two sevens

2143
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:10,850
And take of the air from its tyre on
North East side.

2144
02:04:11,730 --> 02:04:15,020
The think we got to observe is that he
too is in white and blue.

2145
02:04:16,230 --> 02:04:18,150
Why did they call you for enquiry Sir?

2146
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:20,980
Everyone in Telugu states know about
history of our Gandikota.

2147
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:23,730
They may have
called to know this even in United States

2148
02:04:23,850 --> 02:04:24,600
Please tell me.

2149
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:26,400
How can I help you?

2150
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:28,980
Why did you put the crane blocking
the road in 7th Avenue?

2151
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:31,770
Is that crane any property of
your mother’s husband?

2152
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:35,900
That’s earned by me. Still, Government
fined me and I’ve already paid that.

2153
02:04:36,150 --> 02:04:37,100
Topic is over!

2154
02:04:37,730 --> 02:04:39,600
See, how he is behaving not
knowing the matter

2155
02:04:39,650 --> 02:04:42,600
Brother, I told his name
-He told your name.

2156
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:45,100
Senator died as the route got diverted

2157
02:04:45,230 --> 02:04:45,850
Is it?

2158
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:48,150
In which graveyard are the final rites
going to be conducted?

2159
02:04:48,230 --> 02:04:50,150
He didn’t let go his manners, he and
his graveyard, bloody

2160
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:52,100
Why did you plan for Senator’s murder?

2161
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:54,480
What is Senator and murder?
What are you talking?

2162
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:58,270
You along with your friends Miryala and
Kandula, planned Senator's murder...

2163
02:04:59,230 --> 02:05:01,230
How can they be my friends? Cheap people!

2164
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:02,850
I’m from an esteemed family.

2165
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:04,770
His dad is a graveyard keeper Sir
- He too looks the same

2166
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:06,480
Miryala, Kandual! What happened, man?

2167
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,350
You’ll experience now and you’ll then know

2168
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:09,650
Why did you keep the crane
blocking the road?

2169
02:05:09,730 --> 02:05:12,230
For his bad luck - To cover the bad sight
of Sukrudu (Jupitor Planet.)

2170
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:13,020
Sukh!(Jupitor)

2171
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,480
Yes - Who is he?

2172
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:17,600
Not a person Sir, it’s a planet.

2173
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:21,100
Will you cover a planet with a crane?
-It’s just the eyes

2174
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:27,100
Oh no...

2175
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:29,650
Oh no... Oh God!

2176
02:05:31,270 --> 02:05:34,730
Why, why did you do this? -I’ll say,
I’ll say sir

2177
02:05:34,850 --> 02:05:36,980
Sukrudu (Jupitor Planet) is
looking with a slant look.

2178
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:39,480
Some construction of yours is
happening in 4th Avenue, right?

2179
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,150
Yes.

2180
02:05:40,230 --> 02:05:42,850
Look for the correct corner and place your
crane blocking the road.

2181
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:46,400
Chitra, peace messenger Junior Paul is
also coming for the enquiry

2182
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:48,730
Even he is following white
and blue uniform.

2183
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:52,480
Sir, can you tell why they called you?

2184
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,400
Great one!

2185
02:05:54,650 --> 02:06:00,350
Many call us for our blessings, they make
me do prayers and cleanse their sins.

2186
02:06:00,350 --> 02:06:03,270
God created every particle
in the Universe.

2187
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:06,520
My heart feels even they
called me for the same.

2188
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:09,480
Kandula, why talk about my dynasty
infront of outsiders...

2189
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,770
Shut up rascal, false prestige isn’t gone
even after so much happened

2190
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:13,480
Are we waste fellows ? - I mean, I
didn’t think you were here.

2191
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:17,350
When you’re in search of peace, even
happiness will be found

2192
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:19,480
May ghost bless you! Paul!

2193
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:21,480
May God bless you!

2194
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:22,850
Why’ve you done this?

2195
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:24,770
What do you mean by this work ?

2196
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:27,480
Are they the marriages I got
done for widows?

2197
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:29,850
Support I’ve provided for the orphans?

2198
02:06:29,850 --> 02:06:34,150
Getting small kids educated or to give
shelter to the old people?

2199
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:38,230
Planning the Senator’s murder - Paula!
Paula!

2200
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:41,100
What do you mean by saying I planned the
murder, you devil eyed rascal?

2201
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:42,520
Why do you look so, rascal?

2202
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:46,100
I’m the one doing prayers across 148
nations for Presidents and Prime Ministers.

2203
02:06:46,150 --> 02:06:48,100
I’ll curse and kill you, dirty rascal.

2204
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,350
This Paul’s skin will be peeled.

2205
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:53,600
He would become very fair.

2206
02:06:58,350 --> 02:06:59,020
Tell me.

2207
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:00,850
See his potentiality

2208
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:03,770
Even his dad was the same, never
used to shake at all.

2209
02:07:03,850 --> 02:07:07,480
No... Paul Sir!

2210
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:09,900
Who are you? Why did you come from India?

2211
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:11,150
To do black magic Sir

2212
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:13,100
What? - Black Magic Sir.

2213
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:17,480
Black magic to kill whom? Is it the
Senator? Is it Senator?

2214
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:21,850
Come on sir, will there any
black magic these days?

2215
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:24,520
If yes, will PM and Trump be there?
Will you be here?

2216
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:25,350
Is black magic not there?

2217
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:26,850
No, you fools.

2218
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:29,350
Then Pulla Reddy? - He won’t die,
you idiots

2219
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:31,230
That means, they planned
another murder Sir.

2220
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:33,850
You waste fellow, don’t talk
with half knowledge.

2221
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:37,230
I’m just an artist and the main man
behind all this is different.

2222
02:07:38,270 --> 02:07:39,230
Who is he?

2223
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:41,480
Akbar, that man

2224
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:44,850
Hail my Lord!

2225
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:45,850
Look Darkha

2226
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,850
I don’t need to know whether you
have powers or not.

2227
02:07:48,230 --> 02:07:52,480
They’re following you. If you follow what
I say, I’ll give you 50000 Dollars.

2228
02:07:52,850 --> 02:07:53,730
Here is the advance.

2229
02:07:54,230 --> 02:07:57,230
We shouldn’t delay when a
good chance comes in

2230
02:07:57,230 --> 02:07:57,850
Good luck - Ok

2231
02:07:57,850 --> 02:07:59,230
Chidambaram - Sir

2232
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:02,230
He is relaxing like a pig.

2233
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,100
Darkha Sir - What still Darkha Sir?

2234
02:08:04,230 --> 02:08:06,400
What Darkha idiot, there isn’t any
black magic? - No dude.

2235
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:07,480
Then how did the tree turn black?

2236
02:08:10,850 --> 02:08:13,480
I poured acid - Acid, you
poured acid idiot?

2237
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,770
Chidambaram - Sir.

2238
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:17,850
He used all these buffoons very cleverly.

2239
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:21,850
In order to not have any obstacles for his
problem, he planned backup for the hiccup.

2240
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:22,980
He’s a genius.

2241
02:08:23,150 --> 02:08:25,730
He used these to kill the Senator.

2242
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:29,520
I’ll use these to catch that guy now.

2243
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:31,350
Why are the Police coming again dude?

2244
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:33,150
You understood what he is, right?

2245
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:34,770
Understood very well Sir.

2246
02:08:34,850 --> 02:08:35,600
Good.

2247
02:08:35,650 --> 02:08:39,600
Within 24 hours, you should catch
him and handover to us

2248
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:44,520
If not, you know the power of FBI and how
strict is the law here, right?

2249
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,730
You all will be hanged.

2250
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:49,730
Amar!

2251
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:51,600
Amar!

2252
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:55,100
Amar... Open the door.

2253
02:08:56,350 --> 02:08:57,850
Doctor, hi!

2254
02:08:58,150 --> 02:08:59,350
Hello, how are you?

2255
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:01,150
I was thinking to call you - I see.

2256
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:05,230
My friend is giving a grand party and I
would really like it, if you could come.

2257
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:07,100
Sure, relax! - Is it?

2258
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:10,850
Miryala, as per what you said that Doctor
looks the same as Akbar, right?

2259
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:13,730
Yes, both look alike but characters
are entirely different

2260
02:09:13,770 --> 02:09:15,020
What Bobby? - I see

2261
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:16,730
He doesn’t know at all how Akbar looks,
right?

2262
02:09:16,770 --> 02:09:18,350
You got to know too much dude

2263
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:19,730
I got an excellent idea.

2264
02:09:19,730 --> 02:09:21,730
As we cannot catch Akbar by any means,

2265
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:23,980
if we catch this Doctor and hand him over
to that officer, we can escape.

2266
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:26,270
Idea is great Kandula, I appreciate you.

2267
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:27,480
Hey, message from Pooja

2268
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:30,270
Today evening there’s a costume
presentation party,

2269
02:09:30,270 --> 02:09:32,730
I invite you to attend
and Dr. Antony sir is also coming

2270
02:09:33,770 --> 02:09:35,350
Hey Gandikota - Respect.

2271
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:36,230
Hey, get lost.

2272
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:38,400
We won’t get a better opportunity than
this to catch that Doctor.

2273
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:40,020
Oh my God of the Lord of the rings,

2274
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:42,850
For my love to be a success, I should
somehow save Dr. Antony. That’s it!

2275
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:47,600
I’m stuck and for my money to come,
I should make Amar Sir escape.

2276
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:48,900
I don’t need even if he dies later.

2277
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:38,480
Enjoy openly and chill Hey dear,
why confusions?

2278
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:42,230
Right or wrong, you enjoy now

2279
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:50,350
Mix wine with brain Search
for brakes to time

2280
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:55,020
Why the past things, let go

2281
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:59,770
It’s a danger if matter worsens

2282
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:05,900
When drowned in trance, won’t
nature swallow the future?

2283
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:11,600
Stop the revolving globe
Throw the solid Dollar

2284
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:17,600
Smile and let go mistakes and confusions.

2285
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:26,400
Don’t say avenge or the revenge. Life
is just one, live it.

2286
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:32,400
Don’t say love or risk Take it easy, idiot

2287
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:35,520
Love is like Tooty Fruity and there’s a
beauty for sure.

2288
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:38,480
Like the moon
landing in your hands.

2289
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:41,350
What’s the difference between you and me,
keep aside all the warnings

2290
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:44,480
We shall enjoy like some devil is over us

2291
02:12:44,850 --> 02:12:50,650
Let go all confusing questions Enjoy the
peg riding over the head

2292
02:12:50,980 --> 02:12:56,980
Don’t say anyone to stop Look
around for all types

2293
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:30,100
Come sir.

2294
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:34,270
We risked our lives to catch him. We’ll go
if you can give the suitable reward

2295
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:35,150
Where’s he?

2296
02:13:35,230 --> 02:13:36,480
Here we go

2297
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:38,520
I’m not interested

2298
02:13:39,230 --> 02:13:39,850
What’s this?

2299
02:13:39,980 --> 02:13:41,350
Some mistake took place somewhere Sir

2300
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:44,400
We covered cloth on this dirty fellow in
that darkness mistaking for his boss.

2301
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:45,100
Who is the Boss?

2302
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:46,600
The guy you need

2303
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:47,730
Do you have the number of your boss?

2304
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:49,350
Oh no, looks like Doctor
Sir will be booked

2305
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:50,850
How will he have his phone number?

2306
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:52,730
If not him will you have his
Boss’s phone number?

2307
02:13:53,230 --> 02:13:53,980
Give your phone.

2308
02:13:54,150 --> 02:13:55,150
I won’t use a phone Sir

2309
02:13:58,600 --> 02:13:59,980
Password - Face ID

2310
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:04,650
Don’t say that I gave it, Sir.

2311
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:23,680
For your whereabouts to come from
Intelligence Department,

2312
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:25,220
it got a bit delayed.

2313
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:28,800
After both your friends Died, I thought
even you would have escaped.

2314
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:31,100
But I came to know the reason for you to
be right here is that

2315
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:33,300
Aishwarys is still alive.

2316
02:14:36,550 --> 02:14:40,300
Kharge, its no more a doubt.
It’s confirmed.

2317
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:45,800
Aishwarya is alive. Proof for that is
the fear seen in his eyes.

2318
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:49,800
When the first one died, I thought
the sins got ripened.

2319
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:55,550
When the second one died, I
thought sins are hunting.

2320
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:59,470
When even the third one died, I fell in
the thought whether it is the
sin or the revenge

2321
02:14:59,680 --> 02:15:02,300
I now understood that revenge is hunting.

2322
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:04,430
It’s confirmed, Amar is alive

2323
02:15:06,350 --> 02:15:08,600
Proof for that is the fear seen in you.

2324
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:12,550
The revenge Amar postponed in childhood,
he is taking it now.

2325
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:17,300
You don’t need to pray any God,
because God is behind Amar.

2326
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:19,800
I don’t have the habit of praying to God.

2327
02:15:20,180 --> 02:15:23,800
If you say where is Aishwarya is,
I’ll leave you alive

2328
02:15:23,850 --> 02:15:27,180
When my friends helped, you
took their lives

2329
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:30,800
For the help they did to me, I’ll
happily give away my life.

2330
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:34,180
But, I’ll never say where Aishwarya is.

2331
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:39,430
What I need is not your answer,
but your finger print

2332
02:15:45,850 --> 02:15:48,680
First name, Aishu baby! Kharge!

2333
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:51,680
Hello uncle

2334
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:53,470
Your uncle met with an accident.

2335
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:54,430
What happened?

2336
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:55,550
Where is he now?

2337
02:15:55,930 --> 02:15:57,300
He’s out of danger now.

2338
02:15:57,430 --> 02:15:59,850
If you say where you are and which color
dress you are in,

2339
02:15:59,850 --> 02:16:02,300
My people will
come and pick you up.

2340
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:08,680
Hello.

2341
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:11,600
I heard the voice of the guy who
is wishing to kill me.

2342
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:12,970
I wish to see.

2343
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:14,800
Karan Arora!

2344
02:16:17,930 --> 02:16:21,300
When someone asks me what’s the
happiest moment of your life,

2345
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:24,300
I don’t know what you used to say.

2346
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:27,930
but you would say only what I’m
saying now from today.

2347
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:30,930
I’m sure. Aishwarya is alive.

2348
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:43,050
And one more good news to you.

2349
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:45,600
Even your Jalal uncle is with us.

2350
02:16:51,350 --> 02:16:52,970
You can see both, if you come

2351
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:54,550
Where?

2352
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:56,800
99...7.5... Shakelton.

2353
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:09,600
Kharge, I’ll torture him and kill
Aishwarya in front of his eyes

2354
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:14,300
Don’t have any programs like killing them
in front of their eyes and vice versa Sir.

2355
02:17:14,430 --> 02:17:16,550
He’s very dangerous and a Jackson prisoner

2356
02:17:16,550 --> 02:17:18,680
As and when he comes, shoot him down first

2357
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:20,300
Girl anyways is in our hands.

2358
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:23,300
If you have any sadism from your end,
try it there Sir.

2359
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:26,850
No Kharge, I should show him what pain is

2360
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:48,550
Arora, thanks for being fit.

2361
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:52,300
Why because....there’s a chance to live
many years with this fitness.

2362
02:17:52,550 --> 02:17:54,800
Being such a fit guy, I’m killing you.

2363
02:17:54,930 --> 02:17:59,680
You escaped from my hands as a kid and
you’re now dying in my hands.

2364
02:17:59,970 --> 02:18:01,300
It’s all destiny

2365
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:02,930
I too believe in destiny.

2366
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:06,300
It wasn’t me who escaped then,
but your death.

2367
02:18:22,470 --> 02:18:24,550
He didn't listen when I told him to
shoot as soon as he comes.

2368
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:27,180
He isn’t understanding even when his
people are in danger.

2369
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:29,550
I can’t understand where this
situation graph would lead.

2370
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:38,220
Shoot him, Sir I say shoot him right away

2371
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:35,100
Please leave me.

2372
02:19:41,350 --> 02:19:42,300
Give the Fido ring.

2373
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,720
Give me back

2374
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:46,100
Leave me, please leave me.

2375
02:19:46,180 --> 02:19:48,550
Tell me one reason, I’ll leave you

2376
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:52,180
Should I leave you for killing my parents?

2377
02:19:52,930 --> 02:19:55,970
Should I leave for you turning our
Paradise into a graveyard?

2378
02:19:57,050 --> 02:20:02,220
Should I leave you for mentally torturing
my Aishwarya, why should I leave you?

2379
02:20:02,850 --> 02:20:06,680
You should leave me as your
Aishwarya is in my hands.

2380
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:11,850
Should I leave you for still
blackmailing me?

2381
02:20:32,220 --> 02:20:35,220
Chidambaram, Aishwarya is right here, but
why did he behave like that?

2382
02:20:35,430 --> 02:20:37,180
I’m not Aishwarya, I’m Nancy.

2383
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:39,680
That means you cheated me, you... No!

2384
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:44,300
Why did she hit with the leg not even
caring that you’re an FBI officer Sir?

2385
02:20:44,430 --> 02:20:47,180
Will she hit with hand if not with
the leg, you idiot?

2386
02:20:47,430 --> 02:20:49,930
How did this dirty Nancy come in
to Aishwarya’s place?

2387
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:56,720
Nancy, where are you?

2388
02:20:58,050 --> 02:21:00,300
Thank God, go to 9/11 memorial immediately

2389
02:21:00,430 --> 02:21:02,470
And please wear Blue Jeans
and White shirt.

2390
02:21:02,550 --> 02:21:04,430
Make it fast Nancy... I will be
in touch with you.

2391
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:05,220
Aishu in trouble.

2392
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:06,350
Okay.

2393
02:21:14,930 --> 02:21:16,930
Hi, are you Aishwarya? - Yes

2394
02:21:16,970 --> 02:21:18,350
Please come with us. Please...

2395
02:21:18,550 --> 02:21:21,220
Damn! It somehow happened, say what next,
Sir

2396
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:24,550
I killed that Journalist
Robert for Rajveer.

2397
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:26,800
All died without giving me the
payment promised.

2398
02:21:27,050 --> 02:21:30,050
Reason for all this is that Amar.

2399
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:34,300
I’ll see how he would escape from all
the murders he committed.

2400
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:43,720
Aishu Birthday.

2401
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:45,970
Hey, Aishu what are you doing..?

2402
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:48,600
Today is your birthday right... so
planting this for you.

2403
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:49,680
Thankyou Aishu.

2404
02:23:16,550 --> 02:23:17,100
Doctor!

2405
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:19,930
Sorry, I’m not the Doctor, but Amar

2406
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:23,930
This place is ours.

2407
02:23:26,350 --> 02:23:27,050
Amar!

2408
02:23:28,930 --> 02:23:29,930
Pooja, what happened?

2409
02:23:32,050 --> 02:23:33,050
I’m not Pooja

2410
02:23:36,350 --> 02:23:37,300
Aishwarya!

2411
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:41,100
Aishu

2412
02:23:43,550 --> 02:23:44,430
Your Aishu!

2413
02:24:08,550 --> 02:24:09,300
Lucky.

2414
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:15,350
They both have come together now

2415
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:19,180
And the psychological issue they have
will slowly fade away.

2416
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:22,300
Life's value won't go down
just for one defeat.

2417
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:25,300
Similarly just one victory can't
dictate for hundred years.

2418
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:27,140
Policy to think tomorrow is mine is better

2419
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:29,800
than the philosophy
that there's no tomorrow.

2420
02:24:30,430 --> 02:24:32,930
The path to reach our destination not
visible even by lifting the head and seen,

2421
02:24:32,930 --> 02:24:34,180
is below our feet.

2422
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:37,430
Not with tiredness, but let's
step ahead with hope.

2423
02:24:37,970 --> 02:24:39,930
If possible, till the end.

2424
02:24:45,430 --> 02:24:47,550
Your honor, Amar isn’t a criminal.

2425
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:51,800
He is a patient suffering from
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

2426
02:24:51,970 --> 02:24:54,550
Your honor, if one has this problem

2427
02:24:54,550 --> 02:24:59,180
the original guy doesn’t know as to what
he’s doing

2428
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:03,800
Or what he’s thinking while
behaving like the other person.

2429
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:08,100
He murdered them all, when he wasn’t
himself but somebody else.

2430
02:25:09,350 --> 02:25:14,180
The court acquits Amar from
all the charges.

2431
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:16,930
Why did you give witness in his favor,
Sir?

2432
02:25:17,300 --> 02:25:20,180
I killed that Journalist
Robert for Rajveer.

2433
02:25:20,300 --> 02:25:22,180
I thought this blackmailing trend is only
in Telugu states,

2434
02:25:22,180 --> 02:25:24,050
But it has even
spread to United States.

2435
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:28,930
Hearty welcome to WATA committee new
chairman Mr. Chetan Sharma.

2436
02:25:28,970 --> 02:25:29,550
Hello...

2437
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:30,800
Sir.

2438
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:34,680
Are you good? - Good Sir

2439
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,430
Good.

2440
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:37,180
Mr. Raju.

2441
02:25:37,430 --> 02:25:39,430
Miryala, why those tears?

2442
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:41,850
Hello to all - He’s my boy Sir.

2443
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:44,100
Miryala, water

2444
02:25:44,430 --> 02:25:46,430
Coming dude... Coming Sir

2445
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:52,930
What man, haven’t you still
given up to make toys?

2446
02:25:53,050 --> 02:25:55,680
Just for time pass Sir - Time pass
again for your life!

2447
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:56,350
Paul Sir

2448
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:57,970
Hey, shall I call the FBI?

2449
02:25:58,050 --> 02:26:00,550
No sir, if needed I’ll cook
even in your WATA.

2450
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:01,970
Work with concentration

2451
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:05,050
Sir genuinely gave money, but I
ruined it all by morning

2452
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:06,760
I couldn’t find out that there is loss
right in Las Vegas also!

2453
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:08,470
I couldn't find
out... I couldn't find out.z
