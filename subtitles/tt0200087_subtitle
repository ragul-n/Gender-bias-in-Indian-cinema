1
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:53,249
Each grain of sand holds
a brave heart.

2
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:59,582
Born from this earth
are true patriots.

3
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:39,874
Beware lest life turns to death,"
my friends!"

4
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:49,707
"Peace is in peril and
the nation in strife!"

5
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:55,874
"Light the flame of patriotism
in your hearts, my friends!"

6
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:06,124
"Beware lest life turns to death,
my friends!"

7
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:43,082
"On the one hand is love and duty!"

8
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:58,957
"On the other lies the quicksand
of betrayal!"

9
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:04,207
"Quiet are the shanties!
Quiet are the towers!"

10
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,540
"A weary sadness engulfs
the entire nation."

11
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,749
"Those who shower flames
from the skies."

12
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,332
"Will scorch the lush
fields of the earth."

13
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:31,124
"Peace is in peril and
the nation in strife!"

14
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:37,124
"Alight the flame of patriotism
in your hearts, my friends!"

15
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:47,457
"Beware lest life turns to death,
my friends!"

16
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:57,582
"Peace is in peril and
the nation in strife!"

17
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:03,582
"Alight the flame of patriotism
in your hearts, my friends!"

18
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:14,957
"Beware lest life turns to death,
my friends!"

19
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:11,749
"For a few pieces of silver
sell not your soul."

20
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:28,540
"For evil shall always beget evil."

21
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:34,457
"When have evildoers lived long,
my friends?"

22
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:39,832
"The shadow of death looms
over them at every step!"

23
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,832
"For evil shall always beget evil."

24
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:51,499
"Only cowards hide from the truth!"

25
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:58,832
"For true patriots will
shed their blood..."

26
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:04,915
"...to cleanse this land!"

27
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:09,374
"Alight the flame of patriotism
in your hearts, my friends!"

28
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:20,624
"Beware lest life turns to death,
my friends!"

29
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:30,332
"Peace is in peril and
the nation in strife!"

30
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:36,457
"Alight the flame of patriotism
in your hearts, my friends!"

31
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:57,082
"Beware lest life turns to death,
my friends!"

32
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,332
Calm down.

33
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,624
Please sit down.

34
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,207
How can the minister answer your
questions? One at a time.

35
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,707
Yes, your question.

36
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:21,915
How did the tribals get such
sophisticated arms?

37
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,624
We're investigating that.
But l assure you...

38
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,290
l'm not going to spare the
people responsible.

39
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,957
lnnocents were slaughtered.

40
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,790
What guarantees it won't
happen again?

41
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,415
l'm concerned too.

42
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,749
But l assure you it
won't happen again.

43
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,957
The Mumbai Police Crime Branch
is investigating this case.

44
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,540
A special team will
be investigating.

45
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,832
Greetings, sir! - Greetings!

46
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,249
You're late, Major Beg.

47
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,790
l've good news.

48
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,332
The papers in Hindustan are
full of news of our success.

49
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,832
Who did all this?

50
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,207
There's someone called Veeran.

51
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,290
And what was his grouse? - None.
We cooked up some.

52
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,874
That's our mandate.

53
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,249
Find the disgruntled elements
and help them.

54
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,165
Give them guns and money.
Let them get used to it.

55
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,582
This is war.

56
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,915
And we've to win this war.

57
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,707
By the way,
where is this Chandrapur?

58
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,999
Here's Bombay.

59
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,290
And Chandrapur is here
on the border of...

60
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,249
...Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.

61
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,040
Greetings, sir.

62
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,707
How come so early?

63
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,540
Actually,
you shouldn't be staying here.

64
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,207
What?

65
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,374
The case has been transferred
to Mumbai.

66
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,790
So what? For a couple of days...

67
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,540
They'll shout themselves hoarse
and then be quiet.

68
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,249
Not this time.

69
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,624
Veeran's attack has
raised a furore.

70
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,957
So what am l to do?
Did l do anything?

71
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,832
People from the Crime Branch
in Mumbai are here.

72
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,624
They might come here too.

73
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,124
You better slip away.

74
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,582
These special officer
are unpredictable...

75
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,124
lf they get their hands on you
l won't be able to do a thing.

76
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,707
How far is the police station?
- Nearby. He'll escort you.

77
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:00,999
Hey go with sir.

78
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,749
Go to the police station and
get the case papers. - Ok.

79
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,457
So you know inspector
Salim in Mumbai?

80
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,665
Yes, sir.

81
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,290
He's all praise for you...

82
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,665
...and you're so quiet.

83
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:30,915
Bala Thakur is the man behind
everything that happens here.

84
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,124
Bal Thakur? Who is that?
- The don in these parts.

85
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,582
There are so many complaints
against him.

86
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,207
The police don't arrest him?
- He has been hauled up...

87
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,582
So many times. But he gets away
every time with his contacts.

88
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,290
ln the last three years or so,
he has bought two wine shops...

89
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,915
...a huge hotel in Chandrapur
and lot of land.

90
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,165
lnterrogate him,
and you'll know the whole game.

91
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,457
Where does he live? - Nearby.

92
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,624
Crime Branch, Mumbai.
Where is Bala Thakur?

93
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,915
Gone out. - Out?

94
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,332
Wait...

95
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,582
No one searches Thakur
sir's house.

96
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,790
Don't. You'll regret it.

97
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,999
Don't do this! You'll regret
it when the sir comes back!

98
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:48,207
Your sir isn't coming back,
tell him to report to ACP Rathod...

99
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,790
...or he's dead.

100
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,624
C'mon, Kadam! - Yes, sir.

101
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,040
Make sure he understands.

102
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,040
Make sure you tell your boss.
Tell him to get to Mumbai.

103
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,957
The only way to save his neck...

104
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,665
...is to report to ACP Rathod.

105
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,290
lf we find him, he's dead!

106
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,332
l told you not to shout here!

107
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,957
Get down. - He's becoming naughty.

108
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,665
Let's go, Papa!

109
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,040
Ajay, listen... - Yes, Uncle?

110
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,790
Would you like to attend
a ghazal concert?

111
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:50,124
Gulfam Hasan is performing.
- Great! How can l refuse?

112
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,999
When is it?
- At six. Hurry.

113
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,332
Thank you.

114
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:55,874
One minute.

115
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,874
Daddy, l'm going to Gulfam
Hasan's concert.

116
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,415
Mummy, here's your bread.
l'm going out.

117
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,415
Where to? - l'll have dinner later.

118
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,540
Our guest this evening...

119
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:18,332
...is someone who is
world renowned...

120
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,707
...and this famous singer
is Gulfam Hasan.

121
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,624
He's our guest this evening
and also our host.

122
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,207
He's our guest as
well as our host.

123
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,999
He belongs as much to Pakistan as
much as he belongs to lndia.

124
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,624
He spent his childhood here
and he grew up there.

125
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,499
His ghazals are written there,
but his music belongs here.

126
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,332
l present the honourable
Gulfam Hasan.

127
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,665
Thank you.

128
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:09,249
l belong as much to Pakistan
as l belong to Hindustan.

129
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,999
My ties to both the lands are
emotional and sentimental...

130
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,999
...which transcends
all relationships.

131
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:21,832
ln the poetic language of
ghazal it's called love.

132
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:28,165
Lost is all awareness!
Lost is all reasoning!

133
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,290
Obsession with love
turns man inhuman!

134
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:18,165
"The conscious will never know
what a trance really is..."

135
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:32,707
"Do fall in love to know
what life really is..."

136
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:42,999
"The conscious will never know
what a trance really is..."

137
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:39,457
"Our eyes had only to meet for
our worlds to light up."

138
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:58,749
"Only then did l realise
the true magic of love."

139
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:14,749
"Do fall in love to know
what life really is."

140
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:55,540
"The cascading locks unveiled
the blossoming seasons."

141
00:21:56,166 --> 00:22:15,665
"The lowered gaze told me what
intoxication really is."

142
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:31,082
"Do fall in love to know
what life really is."

143
00:22:41,583 --> 00:23:11,749
"My lips could never speak out
the thoughts in my heart."

144
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:31,707
"She could never really know
what my silence meant."

145
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:46,915
"Do fall in love to know
what life really is..."

146
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,374
You know me, don't you?

147
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:02,207
No.

148
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,082
l'm Ajay Singh.

149
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,082
So?

150
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:12,832
l want to tell you something.
- Go on.

151
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,499
Here? - Why not here?

152
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:25,124
Can we go somewhere else?
- Why? Just say it here.

153
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:31,624
Ok. We know each other...

154
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,874
No! l mean we don't know
each other so well.

155
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,332
So l wanted to see you. - Bus...

156
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,915
Bus? - My bus is here.

157
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:07,165
They've been threatening.
They've phoned twice already.

158
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:11,624
Listen to me!
- How much more do l listen?

159
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,624
l'm not letting you go out!
They are terrorists!

160
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,207
Must you stand witness
against them?

161
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,415
Why not? My friends were killed.

162
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,124
My colleagues are deposing too.

163
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,332
But they didn't get threats!

164
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:27,499
Don't worry,
they're going together.

165
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,790
Let's go, Papa. lt's time for
the court. - Ok, let's go.

166
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,332
Off you go to granny.

167
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,082
Let's go together. - C'mon.

168
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,874
Do whatever you want,
no one ever listens to me!

169
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,415
l'm going to college.

170
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,999
l want to go with grandpa!

171
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,165
Stop! Please!

172
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,999
Stop!

173
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,874
Get out!

174
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,207
You come to the police
station everyday...

175
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:20,957
...harass and drives me crazy!

176
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,582
Hey old man, who is he?
- He's my nephew.

177
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,665
lf l see him here ever again,
l'll fix him!

178
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,040
Am l the one who took
your father away?

179
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,499
You want all my men to start
looking for your father?

180
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,665
You'll be told when he's found.
Now get lost!

181
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,749
Enough...

182
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,707
How long are we to go
on living like this?

183
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,790
We're doing whatever we can.

184
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:56,707
Have patience. Patience.

185
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:04,124
A car...

186
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:21,332
What happened to you?
What have you done to him?

187
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,582
The same that the police do to us.

188
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,207
We told him not to depose.
Then why did he have to?

189
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:27,999
Now show him to the police.

190
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,957
We treat people who
help the police...

191
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,457
...the same way the police
treat our people.

192
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,540
Staring at me, are you? Staring?

193
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:42,124
You'll end up just
like your father.

194
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,582
Go and tell everyone!

195
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:46,832
This is what happens to those
who depose against us.

196
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,249
C'mon!

197
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:01,999
You must realise there's
nothing left here.

198
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,124
Come with me to Mumbai.

199
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,124
Stop teasing me.

200
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,832
Teasing you? - What else is this?

201
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:17,207
You're the one who does that...
like the other day...

202
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,707
...when he came to see you.
- l was just pulling his leg.

203
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,790
l never thought he wouldn't
come back.

204
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:29,832
Tell me. Why isn't he coming?
- No idea. l haven't seen him...

205
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,999
...and their house is empty.
No one lives there now.

206
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,999
They say,
Gulfam has his own charm!

207
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,374
Come on.

208
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:08,624
Your attention please.

209
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,999
Mr. Ajay Singh, you're requested
to come backstage.

210
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:17,582
Mr. Ajay Singh from Delhi,

00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,249
Your brother wants to hurry up.

Hurry up. Let's get out
before the traffic jam.

213
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,207

Ajay!

218
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,374
You haven't changed!

219
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:49,749
But you have, since we last met
at the bus stop in Delhi.

220
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,290
lt's been so many years...

221
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:59,082
Your brother is getting angy.

00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:11,999
You disappeared from Delhi!
l kept looking for you.

226
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,957
First tell me,
how come you're here?

227
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,374
Won't you say something?
- Not unless l'm given a chance.

228
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:23,374
Sorry... so how come you're here?
- l live here.

Raiasthan HandicraRs Emporium.

239
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,749
Rajari, handicrafts emporium,
behind Taj hotel. Right?

240
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,915
What took you so long? Who was he?

241
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,415
A friend from Delhi.

242
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,874

00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,124

This way, please.

00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:32,290
Anita, she wants to meet the boss.
Mr. Ajay Singh.

249
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:36,040
So you want to meet the boss?

250
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:37,915
Yes. - Why?

251
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,290
Doesn't he see visitors?

252
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,540
Not all visitors. Do you know him?

253
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,040
Of course, all the way from Delhi.

254
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,124
Don't mind, we're good friends.

255
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,624
Here comes the boss.

256
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,665
Mr. Ajay Singh,
sir, she wants to see you.

257
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,749
The owner of this shop.
- Don't pull my leg.

258
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,665
Seema, this is my sister-in-law.

259
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,874
Meet Seema.
We were in college together.

260
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,040
l know.

261
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,290
And this is the owner.
He's my uncle.

262
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:21,040
l came here to invite you...
l mean, everyone is invited.

263
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,832
We're throwing a small pam.
l'd like it if you come.

264
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,540
See you. - Have a cup of tea.

265
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:33,957
Excuse me. l'm in a hurry.
Don't mind. Next time?

266
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,957
Namaste. - Namaste.

267
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:37,540
Do come.

268
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,290
Yesterday's verse has arrived
in human form.

269
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,915
Politics is so ridiculous.

270
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,415
When we were born,
the whole county was ours.

271
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:04,249
And suddenly we see there's
a Pakistan and a Hindustan.

272
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,040
You should have remained a child.

273
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:10,207
How could l with such beautiful
women around?

274
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:11,790
Come, sit.

275
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,457
There's something l
don't understand.

276
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,165
A ghazal concert... Gulfam Hasan...
this pam... and you?

277
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,957
Let me start from the beginning.

278
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,999
You know how things were in Delhi.

279
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:30,124
My brother's music business
began to do well.

280
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,040
He bought a recording studio
in Mumbai and we came over.

281
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,040
Don't mind,
Gulfam sings exclusively for us!

282
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,290
Brother Roshan looks after the
business and l get bored.

283
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,165
Brother... meet him.

284
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,457
This is Mr. Ajay Singh.

285
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,790
Hello. - Hello.

286
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,207
We used to be in college together.
- Very good.

287
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,457
Are you visiting Mumbai? - No.
l live here.

288
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,582
Great.
You should call him home sometime.

289
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,874
Roshan, a call for you.

290
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,374
Seema, just look after him.

291
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,124
Enjoy yourself.
Don't leave without eating.

292
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,749
Yes, your honour!

293
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,999
The music companies want ghazals
that sound like disco.

294
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:16,290
l'm a great Gulfam fan.
- l'll introduce you.

295
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,124
And where do you find good
poets these days?

296
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:25,124
There is a dearth of
meaningful poetry.

297
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:30,290
lf good poetry isn't written,
how will we sing them?

298
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:33,915
Gulfam sir, meet my guest.
Mr. Ajay Singh.

299
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,665
lf he's your guest,
then it's my honour!

300
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,165
You're always on stage.

301
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,624
No, l dwell in the hearts
of my admirers.

302
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,999
Any doubts, Mr. Ajay?

303
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,665
lf there are any,
let me put it to rest.

304
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,665
"When eyes meet,
hearts do not..."

305
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:57,082
"...the culmination cannot
precede the prelude."

306
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:03,290
That's a very old ghazal.
And you're quite young.

307
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:06,540
Where did you hear it?
- Not me, my uncle...

308
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,999
...heard it in the court of
the Maharaja of Chitpur.

309
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,915
Oh yes!

310
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,415
lt was your first concert.
My uncle recorded all the ghazals.

311
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,957
What a find! But where can
l find the recording?

312
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,582
lt's with me.
l keep listening to it.

313
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:28,999
Ustad lmtiyaz Ali Khan
introduced you.

314
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,665
After his recital, he said...

315
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,999
"Listen to this boy sing,
and you'll forget me."

316
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:41,749
l still try to sing with
the same honesty.

317
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,207
But, it's difficult.

318
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:49,957
But if not sing, l could hear
it and relive those moments.

319
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,374
lf you can give me a copy,
l'll be obliged for life.

320
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,165
No obligations.
You'll surely have what is yours.

321
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,957
Really!

322
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,290
Let's celebrate!

323
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:17,874
Thakur.

324
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,249
What is it?

325
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:21,207
How about a smile?

326
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:26,665
Cut it out, Sultan.
l'm in no mood!

327
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,832
That's a perfume for women.

328
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,957
Perfume for women. - So what?

329
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:40,874
Who is that?

330
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,374
How are you Sultan?
- Thakur? Come... sit...

331
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,082
Boss, Rajan is waiting!

332
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,124
Yes, we will...

333
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,249
Everything all right?
- l got screwed!

334
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:04,374
And you're taking it easy?
- What's up?

335
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,582
The cops came home
and threatened me.

336
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,249
What are you talking.

337
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,082
l'm to surrender to ACP
Rathod or get killed.

338
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,082
What?

339
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,374
Who's this ACP Rathod?

340
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,040
He's the head of the
crime branch here...

341
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,790
...and you don't even know!

342
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,832
Thakur, now that you're here...

343
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:29,707
...relax for a couple of days.
l'll take care things.

344
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,832
Hey Mala, take care of him.

345
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:39,124
Give him a drink. Get it?

346
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,874
l'll be back! Let's go, Shiva.

347
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,165
What would you like?

348
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:56,165
lt's impossible to find an
AK 47 in all of Mumbai.

349
00:38:58,625 --> 00:38:59,332
No.

350
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,832
l'm giving it to you because
l'm a friend.

351
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,082
lt's a great piece.

352
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,124
Here, dump it in a gutter...

353
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,999
...pick it up after a year,
it'll still be as good.

354
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,957
No maintenance issues.

355
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:20,040
100,OOO to a piece.
Did you get cash?

356
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:25,999
Any hurry? - Not at all.
Give it to him.

357
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:27,540
Greetings!

358
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,582
Don't touch the car.
- l'm cleaning the car...

359
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:33,415
...not your pockets!
- You aren't getting paid.

360
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:37,290
Who's looking for money?
l'll take it from Mr. Rajan.

361
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,165
l told you not to touch it.

362
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:45,915
You hit me!
You're new! You don't know me!

363
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,040
Your boss has known me for years!

364
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,082
You don't know me

365
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,874
Greetings boss!

366
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,749
Boss, your man calls me a thief!
l'm Fatka! Remember me, boss?

367
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,332
He calls me a thief!
- Don't talk too much.

368
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,374
The chauffeur calls me a thief!

369
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:14,332
All he gets is a salary of 1000.

370
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,915
l spend 2000 a month on booze!

371
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,207
Why is Thakur here?

372
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,874
Some cop named ACP Rathod
has threatened him.

373
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,207
Surrender, or get killed.

374
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,707
l asked Thakur to stay put
for a couple of days.

375
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,832
l asked Shiva to find out
who this Rathod is.

376
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,165
He's still working on the
Chandrapur report.

377
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,332
l hate this drudgey.

378
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,874
lf l loved writing would
l've joined the police?

379
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:52,374
Give it to me.
Mr. Rathod hates mistakes.

380
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,124
Just fill up the pages.

381
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:57,124
That kid won't be able to
make head or tail of it.

382
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:00,832
He's not a kid. He's big dad!

383
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,457
Here comes your dad. ACP Rathod!

384
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,707
The robbery case is due in
court the day after. - Ok.

385
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,540
l want to discuss the brothel
case with you.

386
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,540
Later.

387
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,332
Sir, we found the
drug case corporater.

388
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:32,874
Where is he? - ln there.

389
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,249
Stop staring at me.

390
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,707
Call up Rathod.
Find out when he's coming.

391
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,915
l haven't got all day!
l'm fasting today!

392
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,665
So he's the one?

393
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:52,624
When you sent for me, l knew.
lt must be a new officer.

394
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:55,499
l don't think they have
introduced me properly.

395
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,999
l'm the local corporater
Ganpat Rao.

396
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,540
The biggest of officers
come to my doorstep.

397
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,332
No one confronts me.

398
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,915
Keep him in remand for 3 days...

399
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,790
...and don't record the arrest.
- Yes, sir.

400
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:16,749
Sir is here!

401
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:23,624
The report will be ready in 5
minutes. - Leave that. Come in.

402
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,415
Get me a glass of water.

403
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,874
Send for inspector Salim.

404
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:37,749
The information was correct.
AK47s were used.

405
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:40,374
A leader instigated the tribals...

406
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,040
...his name is Veeran.

407
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:48,665
And this is Bala Thakur.
He supplied the guns.

408
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,915
He got news of our arrival
and escaped.

409
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,082
We've ordered him to surrender.

410
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,790
Did you investigate
the tribal areas?

411
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,665
How do we face AK47s with
service revolvers?

412
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,665
The tribals aren't our problem,
Thakur is.

413
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,999
When's my meeting with the DCP?
- Eleven O'clock!

414
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:18,082
Where's lnspector Salim?
- On the beat!

415
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:24,582
l told your boss not to send you
here. Then why are you here?

416
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:28,040
l'm just doing what
my boss told me to.

417
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,124
Should l leave? - Leave the cash.

418
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,374
ls it the full amount? - Yes.

419
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:33,874
Close the door behind you.

420
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,165
Put the money away.

421
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,040
Who are you?
- Crime Branch, Mumbai.

422
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,957
Go inside.

423
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:50,624
Just a minute!
Handover the packet.

424
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,832
Check if they're the same notes.

425
00:43:58,666 --> 00:43:59,957
They're the same, sir.

426
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,665
Who is the deputy commissioner
you report to?

427
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:08,332
Why call him up?
Let's settle this mutually.

428
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,665
Where is Bala Thakur?
- Who is Bala Thakur?

429
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:17,540
ln Mumbai. - Where in Mumbai?

430
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:21,290
His contact in Mumbai is Sultan...
He's gone to meet him.

431
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:24,082
But l don't know anything
about Sultan!

432
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,499
l'm telling the truth!

433
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,415
l've told you everythig l knew!

434
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,749
Please, sir!
Let's end the matter here!

435
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:35,915
File a report against him
in his police station.

436
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,332
And a copy of it should be at...

437
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,707
...the DCP's table by
tomorrow morning.

438
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,832
Sir... sir... - Let's go!

439
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,290
Wow! Smells great!

440
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,999
Fatka, pay me up.
- Sure. l'm in a good mood.

441
00:44:58,416 --> 00:45:02,457
Poor girl. lt was her first deal.

442
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:05,165
Go on, now. - Give me the shirt.

443
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:12,999
See you!
- Hey Fatka, pay me! - Later.

444
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:18,457
- All you want is money... money...
- Goddamn bum! Freeloader!

445
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,082
Fool! Go on!

446
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:34,332
Twinkle twinkle little stars!

447
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,082
Who will come into my arms?

448
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:42,124
Hey!

449
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:44,749
lnspector Salim! Greeting sir!

450
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:49,082
My dreams are crushed...
and so is my shirt.

451
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,749
l don't see you around these days.

452
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:57,499
Not at all, sir.
l called you up. - What for?

453
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,457
That Raian whom you externed.
- What about him?

454
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:07,415
He keeps doing the rounds here.
- When did you see him?

455
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:10,290
Many times, even today. - Where?

456
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,290
ln Sangam bar.
You'll find him there.

457
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,415
No, thanks.
This time, it's from me to you.

458
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,332
When you meet Rajan's chauffeur,
give him a whack.

459
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:21,915
He insulted me.

460
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,999
Did you really see Rajan?

461
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,374
l swear it.

462
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,957
Twinkle twinkle little stars!

463
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:43,915
Had you come on time, we could've
picked him up from the bar.

464
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:46,457
Overtake that car.

465
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,915
The police are behind us.

466
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,915
Take the first left.
l don't want hassles.

467
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,832
They're turning left.
- Head straight on.

468
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,249
Good. They went past us.

469
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:11,249
Take a left from here.

470
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:13,082
Take a left!

471
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,249
Come to this side.

472
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,207
Take a right.

473
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:27,749
Easy now.

474
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,290
Get them.

475
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:25,415
Rajan... Rajan...

476
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,290
Take care of him.

477
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:44,999
Sultan! Stop!

478
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:46,499
Or l'm going to shoot!

479
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:26,832
Are you so hungry for medals
that you take such risks?

480
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:28,874
l had the information.
What could l've done?

481
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,957
Handled things more cautiously.

482
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:32,249
There was no time.

483
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,790
So you take three constables
and a service revolver...

484
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,249
...and chase Rajan and Sultan?
- l had news only of Rajan.

485
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:40,499
l didn't know Sultan would
be there with him.

486
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,624
Besides l had arrested
Rajan earlier.

487
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,290
He used to carry a county-made
revolver.

488
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,374
l had no idea he would
have an AK47.

489
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:54,999
lf you're so desperate to die,
then kill yourself!

490
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,415
You've got 3 constables killed!
Who's responsible?

491
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,749
Stay outside.
l'll send for you later.

492
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,790
Salim won't work on
this case anymore.

493
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:12,874
Sir, please.
l'll explain it to him.

494
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:14,790
Explain what?

495
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,415
The whole department feels
that he let Sultan off...

496
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,207
...because he's a Muslim himself.

497
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,249
Salim isn't such an officer.

498
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:25,124
As it is, l've enough pressures.
l can't take chances.

499
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,790
The tribals are armed.

500
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,874
There's no news of Thakur and
now even Sultan has AK47s.

501
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:33,374
This is just what l feared!

502
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:35,999
How many more Sultans
are going around...

503
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:38,374
...this city toting AK47s?

504
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,749
Call Salim.

505
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,749
Sorry, Salim.
l guess l was excited.

506
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,999
Please let Mr. Rathod
have the case papers.

507
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:56,249
From tomorrow,
you can take care of the godowns.

508
00:50:57,666 --> 00:51:01,582
l know why you're taking
me off this case, sir.

509
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:18,082
Salim was my training officer.

510
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,874
l know him. He's a good officer.

511
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,665
He has an extensive network
of informers.

512
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,165
l need Salim on this case.

513
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:32,540
Officially,
Salim is off this case.

514
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:38,707
l understand. Thank you, Sir.

515
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:47,832
The papers aren't ready.
You'll get the file next week.

516
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,832
l don't want the file.

517
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,040
l want you to work with
me on this case.

518
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:55,457
l know everyone's wants.

519
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,915
Salim, l trained under you.
l learnt so much from you.

520
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:04,457
Don't ever say you trained
under me, sir!

521
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,040
l never trained anyone
to suspect someone...

522
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,124
...just because he doesn't
belong to your religion.

523
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,249
You must have learnt
that somewhere else.

524
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,582
You pass one exam... became my
superior and rule over me.

525
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:19,665
Now you think you can ill-treat
me because l'm a Muslim?

526
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:27,290
Now l know! ln this county it's
a crime to be a poor man!

527
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,957
And a bigger crime
to be one like me!

528
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:33,999
Go away, sir.

529
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,874
l don't want to work with you.

530
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,457
Sultan's mother?
Are you sure? - Yes.

531
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,874
How old is she? - 60 or 65.

532
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,999
She lives alone. She's a widow.

533
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:53,832
Sultan is her only son.

534
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,207
Are you Sultan's mother?

535
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,415
Who are you? - Police.

536
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,874
Speak up. ls Sultan your son?

537
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,415
Yes. - Where is he?

538
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,540
He doesn't live here.
- Where does he live?

539
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:19,874
l don't know.

540
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,040
You better say it or
we've our ways.

541
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,207
Sultan was 21 when he committed
his first murder.

542
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,457
l threw him out of the house.

543
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:36,790
lt's been years...

544
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:39,540
...l haven't seen him since.

545
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,790
l didn't look for him...

546
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,165
...and he hasn't come to see me.

547
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,332
Forgive me.
Sometimes, one has to be harsh.

548
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,207
Just a minute...

549
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,332
Please let me have your name
and your telephone number.

550
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:13,707
lf l get any news of Sultan,
l'll let you know immediately.

551
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:20,999
Here's my card.

552
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:24,874
Thank you.

553
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:44,415
lt's here.

554
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:12,040
What is it? - Veeran is here.

555
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:18,040
Why did you bring him here?
- They held a gun at my head.

556
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,790
They wanted to see you right away.

557
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,874
Sultan! lt's Veeran!

558
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,290
Welcome, Brother.

559
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:43,540
You vanished after the
first delivery.

560
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:48,582
l told you we need more arms.
- The cops came home.

561
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:50,582
So l came here.

562
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,874
This is Sultan. - Welcome Veeran.

563
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,915
What does it cost? How much?

564
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:01,832
70,OOO.

565
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:07,707
Without the bullets,
what's it worth?

566
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:11,582
Nothing! lt's useless.

567
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,540
The stuff is worth 12,OOO, OOO.

568
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:23,207
Here's the valuation certificate.
Check it out.

569
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,499
Here's my list. l want 20 AK47s.
The rest in ammunition.

570
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,040
You'll get it?

571
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,165
When?

572
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,707
ln two weeks...

573
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:44,124
Not earlier?

574
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,457
Sultan will ty his best.

575
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,915
Greetings! - Greetings!

576
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:21,665
ls my work done?
- l've drawn up your horoscope.

577
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,790
Greetings. - Greetings.

578
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:27,874
So Veeran sends cash? - Yes.
And a new list.

579
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,665
But he wants less guns
and more ammunition.

580
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:37,165
Anyone who gets a gun will want
bullets... at any cost.

581
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:41,915
But Veeran is a dangerous man.

582
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,332
And he wants it fast.
- He will have it.

583
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:48,457
Pay the priest,
and you'll be blessed.

584
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,999
Here, eat some offerings.

585
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:59,290
Thakur, here's your horoscope.

586
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,832
Keep it at the feet of
the deity you worship.

587
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:08,165
l'm not a big astrologer.

588
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:12,624
But your Saturn is malefic.
- That l know.

589
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:17,165
But there must be a remedy.
- Stay clear of metals.

590
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:23,457
Saturn must be appeased.
Chant the mantra for a fortnight.

591
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:28,499
lf you survive this one,
you'll live to be a hundred.

592
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:41,415
l thought you had forgotten me!
- How could l?

593
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,082
Here you're. The recording
of your first concert.

594
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:53,999
May l keep it? - Yes.
- You have done me a great favor.

595
00:58:55,333 --> 00:59:00,290
This ghazal is from the time when
l used to sing for myself.

596
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:05,624
Nowadays, l sing for others.
This is a priceless gift.

597
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,165
You can name your price.

598
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,332
A price for something priceless?

599
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:16,332
l'd rather you remember
me some times for it.

600
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:18,999
How can l ever forget you?

601
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,874
But you must accept
a gift from me.

602
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:24,832
Gift?

603
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:27,624
Gulfam's friendship.

604
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:41,665
Hi Ajay! - Hi!

605
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,207
l was here to meet Gulfam and
give him the cassette.

606
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,332
Don't mind,
l introduced you to Gulfam.

607
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:50,540
Thank you. Ok, see you.

608
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:53,457
Where are you going? - Nowhere.
Why?

609
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,374
l've to discuss something
important with you.

610
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:58,415
ls it? Tell me.

611
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:01,999
Here? Let's go elsewhere. Get in.

612
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,749
So what's so important?

613
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,165
What l wanted to say...

614
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:19,165
l mean... you know l don't
get sleep nowadays.

615
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:22,915
Must be the mosquitoes.
You could get malaria.

616
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,582
Use a repellent.

617
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,290
l didn't meant that.
What l wanted to say...

618
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:33,082
Do you know what it means when
l say my heart is racing?

619
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:37,665
High BP. A heart ailment. Could
lead to heart failure.

620
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:40,082
Avoid fats and iog daily.

621
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:43,790
l didn't mean that.
What l wanted to say...

622
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:48,249
You know, this strange churning
in the stomach?

623
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:51,624
An upset stomach.
Eat a ripe banana with yogurt.

624
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,499
That'll fix it. - Ajay,
don't mind. lt's so pleasant...

625
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:57,499
...and all you think
of are diseases!

626
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:01,582
You're a fan Gulfam.
Don't you recite poetry?

627
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,749
Sure. Want to hear? - Go on.

628
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:14,290
"Neither medicines can cure,
nor prayers can heal it..."

629
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:18,040
"Lord, let no one suffer
the pangs of love."

630
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:28,207
"Someone tell this fellow..."

631
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:38,165
"...not to be scared of love?"

632
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:54,957
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love?"

633
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:58,707
"The sweet pangs of love
are always a pleasure."

634
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:06,999
"The further he runs...
the nearer l go... l go."

635
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:15,749
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love?"

636
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:33,790
"He's blind to beauty and the
heat of youthful love."

637
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:44,832
"Majnu to Romeo were ruined
for the cause of love."

638
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:55,999
"l'm crazy about him.
lf he's good, l'm even better."

639
01:02:56,166 --> 01:03:07,999
"Being a man, he's crazily shy...
l wonder why... l wonder why..."

640
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:16,999
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love?"

641
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:38,915
"l know for a fact that
this is just an act."

642
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:43,832
"He hides his tremulous heart
as it beats so fast."

643
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:54,915
"My heart's not a open resort that
you can walk in and out."

644
01:03:55,416 --> 01:04:03,665
"When alone he sighs with love but
still pretends not to love."

645
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:15,749
"Never reveals the truth but
keeps lying... lying..."

646
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:24,207
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love."

647
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:28,249
"The sweet pangs of love
are always a pleasure."

648
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:36,540
"The further he runs...
the nearer l go... l go."

649
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:50,582
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love."

650
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:59,165
ln spring flowers blossom,
in the heart so does love.

651
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:07,374
Words can't express true love,
don't my eyes tell you so?

652
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,915
"Come... all are welcome..."

653
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:19,374
"...don't go astray..."

654
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,374
"Come...
be one of us, don't make a fuss."

655
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:30,624
"Come... all are welcome..."

656
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:39,957
What is it? - Scoot!

657
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:44,290
Do you know ACP Rathod? - No.

658
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:47,332
ls he new here? - Yes.
He's with the Crime Branch.

659
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:49,749
l want a full report on him.

660
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,915
Goodness! - Looks fine.

661
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:02,915
No. lt isn't right.
- Don't mind, you look like a hero.

662
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:10,707
How about this one?

663
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,415
This? The other one was better.
This is rubbish.

664
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:21,165
You don't have a sense of style.

665
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,915
These boring clothes you wear...

666
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:51,124
Ajay, where are we going?

667
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:54,582
l don't get this...

668
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:08,540
Give me your cell phone.

669
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,749
l'm Nailk here, Shiv.
From fountain.

670
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:19,165
Rathod here.
Get to Fountain with a few men.

671
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:22,207
Mocambo cafe...
near the parking lot... hurry.

672
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:32,165
Ajay, don't mind...
who is this ACP Rathod? - l am.

673
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:35,082
ACP?
- Assistant Commissioner of Police.

674
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:39,249
And l'm the Queen of Patiala.

675
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:42,332
l'm not joking. - Neither am l.

676
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:46,874
You're the ACP. l'm the queen!
And that fellow is tailing us!

677
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:49,457
Why is he tailing us?
l'll ask him right away.

678
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,832
Hey mister,
why are you tailing us?

679
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:46,915
Why are you arresting me?
What have l done?

680
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,082
Take him away. Put him in remand.

681
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:52,790
What have l done?

682
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,624
Step back!

683
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:09,165
Who are you?

684
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:11,290
Tell me. Who are you?

685
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:48,707
Can't you safely escort one man?

686
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:53,165
You know how important
he's for the case!

687
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,457
But sir... - Shut up!

688
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:01,915
Who was on traffic duty? - Me, sir.

689
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,957
Did you see the man on the
motorbike? - No, sir. - Why?

690
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:06,249
l was booking a car.

691
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:07,624
l know what you were booking!

692
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,290
Weren't you on the beat?
- Yes, sir.

693
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:14,415
l had gone around the corner
for a minute. - A minute!

694
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,832
Look what happened in a minute!

695
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:18,874
You know what can happen
to you in a minute?

696
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,207
You can be transferred.

697
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,957
To a place where there are
no corners to turn into.

698
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:28,582
ls Salim back from sick leave?
- No, sir.

699
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:35,582
Get ten copies of this photo.
- Ok, sir.

700
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:37,082
How many?
- Ten, sir. - lmmediately!

701
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:40,332
We'll meet at Apsara bar
at eight tonight.

702
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:55,790
Salim, how are you? - Fine, sir.
Here's the file.

703
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,707
So you won't work on this case?
- No, sir.

704
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,624
ls that a final decision?
- Who am l to decide?

705
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:06,040
You higher-ups are the
ones who decide.

706
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:11,290
l miss a target, and the whole
department starts gossiping.

707
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:15,290
And l'm shunted off the case.
Why? Because l'm a Muslim.

708
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:19,915
Today, a man dies in your custody
and no one says a word.

709
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:23,832
Why? Because you're a Hindu.
You're an lPS officer.

710
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,832
Maybe your father
is some big shot?

711
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:30,249
lPS officer.
A big shot for a father.

712
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:32,999
Do you know my father?

713
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:35,999
That is my father.

714
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,582
Ask him how l became an lPS.
He won't be able to tell you.

715
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:41,540
He hasn't spoken in years.

716
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,624
And that is my sister-in-law.
She's a widow.

717
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,249
Ask her how she became a widow.

718
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:54,957
Those who killed my brother,
did this to my father...

719
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:57,415
...l don't even know who they are.

720
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,915
l don't want your sympathy
but hear me out.

721
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,415
l broke my back working for
the police services exams.

722
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:07,124
l was selected for the
administrative services.

723
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,582
l could've become a bureaucrat
and lived a comfortable life.

724
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,040
But l chose the police service.

725
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:14,790
Why? Because in every criminal
l see those men.

726
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:18,540
l want to see every criminal
groveling before the law.

727
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:24,665
But this isn't a personal grouse.
This concerns my county.

728
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,707
ls it not my county? - Maybe not?

729
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,874
Maybe that's why you're shirking
your responsibility?

730
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,082
For me, this county is family.

731
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:36,124
And l don't need a Salim to
help me save my family.

732
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,582
Sir, the photos.
- Everyone has one?

733
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:58,207
Anyone knows this bar? - No, sir.

734
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:03,165
Comb all the bars in this area.
We must find this girl.

735
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,207
Split up.

736
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:10,040
What will you do if you find her?

737
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,124
Arrest her? - No.

738
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:15,582
One man stays behind.
The other reports to me.

739
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:17,540
You'll find me in Apsara bar.

740
01:13:51,416 --> 01:14:05,790
"This nubile beauty captivates
the young and old alike."

741
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:19,207
"Who knows what tomorrow holds!
Enjoy your life today!"

742
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:29,832
"This nubile beauty captivates
the young and old alike."

743
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:41,374
"Who knows what tomorrow holds!
Enjoy your life today!"

744
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,374
"This nubile beauty captivates
the young and old alike."

745
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:53,957
Hello, sir.

746
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:57,624
Know her? - She doesn't work here.

747
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:58,790
Ask your boss.

748
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:08,999
Your men are looking
for this girl.

749
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:18,707
"My young heart beats for all as
old and young spirits soar."

750
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:34,915
"We know not what tomorrow holds
so live your life to the hilt."

751
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:42,124
"This nubile beauty captivates
the young and old alike."

752
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:54,374
Who are you looking for?

753
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:55,707
Know this one?

754
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:57,999
Who are you really looking for?

755
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:00,332
Bala Thakur of Chandrapur.

756
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:07,790
"The night is still young and
every heart is in a trance."

757
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:15,290
"lntoxicating is the ambience So
live your life to the hilt."

758
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:24,207
"Life's fun for those who seek
life's pleasures to the hilt."

759
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:41,749
"My young heart beats for all as
old and young spirits soar."

760
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:48,915
"We know not what tomorrow holds."

761
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:55,249
"So live your life to the hilt."

762
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:03,374
"My young heart beats for all..."

763
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,207
Had your dinner? - No.

764
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,957
Go to Kheda Naka.
You'll get the dinner you seek.

765
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:26,540
Tonight at Kheda Naka.

766
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,665
These girls keep changing jobs.
She's nowhere in this area.

767
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:39,082
Let's try Bombay Central.
- Ok, sir.

768
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:41,749
You won't find anything there.

769
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:44,582
What are you doing here?

770
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:47,374
ls there a curfew here?

771
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,957
You're looking for her,
aren't you?

772
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:56,915
But what's the use finding her?
You want Thakur, don't you?

773
01:17:57,916 --> 01:18:01,957
You'll find him at Kheda Naka.

774
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:06,082
Go pick him up.

775
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,499
Wait! Listen to me.

776
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:15,457
l've heard enough.
l've given you Thakur.

777
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:19,249
Go save your county, your family.

778
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:20,957
l'm not needed!

779
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:27,499
l need you! l need ten Salims
to save this family!

780
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:30,999
Not ten,
you'll find thousands of Salims.

781
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,332
Only if you can trust them!

782
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:36,457
Listen to me, sir!

783
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:41,124
Don't ever tell any Salim that
this county isn't his!

784
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,540
l won't.

785
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:13,499
Never.

786
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:42,790
lf the information is bogus
we'll be here all night.

787
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:45,957
lt's genuine. He'll come!

788
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:58,582
A man on a bike.
Looks like the killer!

789
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,749
Relax! Stay put.

790
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:22,499
He's the sniffer. Let him pass.

791
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:42,082
lt's Sultan. - l know.

792
01:20:47,166 --> 01:20:49,915
l won't spare Sultan tonight.

793
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:14,415
That's Patil!
The one we'd threatened.

794
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:20,707
So Thakur... sit...

795
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,082
No one shoots at Thakur.
l want him alive.

796
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:27,499
Got it.

797
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:28,999
Ok, sir.

798
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,582
Careful!
We won't get such a chance again.

799
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:56,832
Your stuff is here.

800
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,540
lt will be delivered to Veeran.

801
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:03,665
How was the girl Mala?

802
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:14,499
l left so many messages but
you refuse to respond.

803
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,499
Who are you?

804
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:17,999
Can't you guess?

805
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:25,499
ACP Rathod!

806
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:30,790
Get up!

807
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:32,915
Quick!

808
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,374
Get the car! Come here!

809
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:37,665
Are you all right, sir?

810
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:40,707
See if Thakur's alive!

811
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,499
Do they want to start a war here?

812
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:11,249
Our enemies are fortunate.

813
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,332
They need not send their
armies to fight us.

814
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,040
Sending arms is enough!

815
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:21,290
How is Rathod?

816
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:36,874
How irresponsible!

817
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:40,415
You should have taken him
to the nearest hospital.

818
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:44,415
Anything could've happened.
He has lost so much blood.

819
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,040
You cannot go inside.

820
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:25,915
Bring it here!

821
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:05,540
Speak up, Mirchi.

822
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,665
Everything has gone wrong.

823
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:13,582
What?

824
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,999
The entire consignment of
arms has been seized.

825
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:26,207
My men aren't to be blamed.
Sultan's men were at fault.

826
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,374
lt's not a mere fault.
lt's a major failing.

827
01:29:29,416 --> 01:29:33,124
Let it be!
They too have lost a lot of money.

828
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:36,832
Sure, but do you think the
police will let things be?

829
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,874
Do you think they'll not
follow up on the case?

830
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:43,540
lf you don't want the police
at your doorstep...

831
01:29:43,625 --> 01:29:45,624
...then you'll have
to do something.

832
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:51,957
You always have to pay
for your mistakes.

833
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:58,374
Now look at what this
creature has done.

834
01:29:59,208 --> 01:30:03,457
Disturbed my privacy and trampled
on my musical antiques.

835
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:07,874
Does it deserve to be spared?

836
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:12,415
Do you know how it
will be punished?

837
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:20,665
Move on...

838
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,457
Take that helmet off!

839
01:30:32,458 --> 01:30:33,374
License?

840
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:40,582
Shut the shop!

841
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:43,915
Come out!

842
01:30:54,708 --> 01:30:58,165
Look at the time! Shut the shop!

843
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:03,540
We should keep out of
Bombay for a few days

844
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:10,082
How did ACP Rathod reach Kheda
Naka? l smell a rat!

845
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:14,457
l don't have the Don's brain
but l know one thing.

846
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:19,249
The old racket was better...
selling heroin.

847
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:22,957
There was no choice!
Mirchi was adamant.

848
01:31:23,541 --> 01:31:26,040
lf we wanted drugs,
we'd to pick up the guns.

849
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:29,374
What could we do?
We had to accept.

850
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,415
Hello Veeran! We...

851
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,832
When will you deliver?

852
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:54,540
You know what happened!
The consignment was seized.

853
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:58,624
Thakur got killed but
you'll get the guns.

854
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,415
But Veeran, we need some time.

855
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:03,582
Time? Come here!

856
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:16,874
See them? Know who they're?

857
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:23,457
Reserve Police.
They are surrounding us!

858
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:26,249
My men don't have bullets
to fight back!

859
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:37,499
Tell your bosses even if one of
my men die, l'll destroy them.

860
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:45,415
l'll deliver as soon as l can.
l give you my word.

861
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:50,457
Your word? Think it over.

862
01:32:51,458 --> 01:33:00,207
lf you don't keep your word,
l'll rip out your tongue.

863
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,832
Then you can give your life
but never your word.

864
01:33:16,916 --> 01:33:19,707
Don't worry.
l'll take care of things here.

865
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:24,749
You'll be taken across the border
and well looked after.

866
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:29,915
Veeran must get his arms.

867
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,874
He will get it!

868
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:35,957
Don't worry we'll get you back
once things cool down.

869
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:41,499
Thank you...

870
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:43,665
Goodbye...

871
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:15,749
News of Sultan's escape to
Pakistan must reach the police.

872
01:34:16,125 --> 01:34:17,957
Then things will cool down.

873
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:21,832
And for now,
forget all your other businesses.

874
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:24,707
Find out how all this happened.

875
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,207
Thakur messed things up.
This time, l'll take delivery.

876
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:13,040
Know why you were spared?

877
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,832
Because you aren't human.

878
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:23,374
l never spare humans
for their mistakes.

879
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:30,040
Years ago humans here
made a major mistake.

880
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:35,082
Political pimps drew a line across
our land partitioning us.

881
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:37,874
Donkeys on both sides
of the line...

882
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:39,749
...then got the freedom to elect...

883
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:41,874
...the donkeys that would
rule over them.

884
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:46,790
The results are evident today.

885
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:51,957
We were doomed.

886
01:35:58,125 --> 01:36:05,999
Once this beautiful palace
was like a pre bride.

887
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:10,207
Now it lies neglected like
an abandoned widow.

888
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,957
l'll not accept this
cruel joke silently.

889
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:19,499
Sire!

890
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:23,499
Sultan has been sent
to the other side!

891
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:27,499
Good!

892
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:30,332
Have you convinced Haji?

893
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:33,832
Yes. But he has a problem.

894
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:37,290
Who will compensate his loss?

895
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:41,915
That's not our problem.
He's in business!

896
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:47,582
He has made enough profits
to take a few losses.

897
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:51,624
However l'll request the General
across the border...

898
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:53,499
...to compensate him!

899
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:57,332
Compensate? He'd promised us a
hundred flashpoints in lndia.

900
01:36:57,916 --> 01:36:59,790
Last news was the bus massacre...
no good news after that!

901
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:07,749
l had great hopes of Gulfam Hasan
but that fool mohajir...

902
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:11,707
...is lost in the warmth
of lndian hospitality!

903
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:17,540
Welcome Baig! You'll leave
for lndia immediately!

904
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,415
Don't panic.
You're going on an official visit.

905
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:30,082
lndia has offered to host an
lndo-Pak meet of poets.

906
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:37,999
They don't want war which
is fine with us...

907
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:43,999
As long as they've men like
Mirchi and Veeran...

908
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:46,915
...what's the need to
fight an actual war?

909
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:49,249
You're right, sir.

910
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:56,957
When you meet Gulfam remind
him of his promise to us...

911
01:37:57,958 --> 01:37:59,665
...if he can't fan the
flames of our...

912
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,415
...proxy war he should come back.

913
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:06,749
He can keep singing with the
useless migrants from lndia.

914
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:14,457
We've erected check posts
all over the city.

915
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:17,040
We've clamped down
on all night-life.

916
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:20,207
Fine! But why is there no
progress in the case?

917
01:38:21,666 --> 01:38:24,749
Where is the motorcycle man?
And what news of Sultan?

918
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:28,915
Sultan's escaped to Pakistan.

919
01:38:29,291 --> 01:38:31,124
He was their main agent
here in Bombay.

920
01:38:31,583 --> 01:38:35,124
Sultan and the motorbike man
both lead to a dead end.

921
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:39,124
But they must have others
in Bombay. Find a link!

922
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:48,999
Come in! Salim, this is Seema.
This is lnspector Salim.

923
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,332
l'll take leave, sir.

924
01:38:53,416 --> 01:38:55,790
Find that motorcycle man.

925
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,665
My entire network is hunting
for that man.

926
01:38:57,916 --> 01:38:58,915
We must find him. - Yes.

927
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,749
Stop! Someone may come!

928
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,290
That's why l'm shutting the door...

929
01:39:08,458 --> 01:39:10,124
...l want the whole story now.

930
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:12,415
Every time you start narrating
someone barges in...

931
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,957
...and the story is
left incomplete.

932
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,874
Alright. Open the door. l'll
tell you the whole story.

933
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:19,290
Promise? - Promise.

934
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,915
Tell me! - What's this?

935
01:39:29,875 --> 01:39:30,790
My dress...

936
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,415
...it'll help brighten your day.
lsn't it lovely?

937
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,790
Yes, but it's a bit short!

938
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:40,999
Don't mind, you're old-fashioned.
just get on with the story.

939
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:45,040
Well, we reached the eatery...

940
01:39:45,125 --> 01:39:47,165
Yes! Yes! l know all that! You
waited for Thakur and Sultan.

941
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,665
They walked in and you asked
Thakur Recognise me?

942
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:55,207
Then Thakur ran... you chased.
They fired and you fired back.

943
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:58,665
We know all that.
What happened after that?

944
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:02,457
After that l grabbed Thakur...
Chintu has come! - Chintu?

945
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:03,957
Chintu... - Uncle!

946
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:08,249
Chintu has come!

947
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:13,249
Who else is with you?
- Mummy, granny and me.

948
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:15,915
God! Then l must be off!

949
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,374
You must meet my mother.

950
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:18,957
Not today. - Why not?

951
01:40:19,541 --> 01:40:23,332
Since you didn't like my dress
will she like it? Problem!

952
01:40:25,416 --> 01:40:27,499
The girl from Delhi!

953
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:29,665
How are you, son?

954
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:33,415
l'm fine!
They should take off this plaster.

955
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,249
Let the doctors decide.

956
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:38,624
This is Seema.

957
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:42,707
The girl from Delhi? - Yes.

958
01:40:43,916 --> 01:40:47,790
Come here.
Where do you live in Delhi?

959
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:52,290
Punjabi Baug. Now l live here.

960
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:54,457
Come home sometime.

961
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:58,957
She's been looking
forward to that.

962
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:00,290
Sure!

963
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:03,790
She's a shy girl.

964
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:08,082
No! She's not shy! She was
sitting on uncle's lap.

965
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,040
Liar! She was next to me.

966
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,999
Rathod's still recovering.
His leg is in a plaster cast.

967
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,832
He's on the first floor,
room no.9. Things are as planned.

968
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:04,499
ls this room no.9?
ls Mr. Rathod asleep?

969
01:42:14,166 --> 01:42:20,249
Mr. Rathod, l'm a friend and
l respect officers like you.

970
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:25,957
You should know some facts and
not take foolish risks.

971
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:28,790
You're lucky the bullet
hit your arm...

972
01:42:29,125 --> 01:42:31,082
...or it could've even been fatal.

973
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:34,624
The case has now reached
its nadir with...

974
01:42:35,875 --> 01:42:37,832
...the fugitives have fled
across the border.

975
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:40,874
And the police are harassing
the innocents here.

976
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:45,290
We're losing out on business.

977
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,915
How long can we take it?

978
01:42:49,833 --> 01:42:51,749
We're incurring huge losses.

979
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:56,082
A couple of millions is
no big deal for us...

980
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:58,165
...you'll get it anytime.

981
01:42:59,041 --> 01:43:04,999
These are bad times.
Hitmen will kill for a pittance!

982
01:43:07,416 --> 01:43:08,665
What do l tell them?

983
01:44:05,666 --> 01:44:07,874
Mr Rathod,!
This behaviour is unacceptable.

984
01:44:08,416 --> 01:44:12,374
Your leg is in plaster and
the wound is yet to heal.

985
01:44:12,666 --> 01:44:17,832
Why take such risks when l've
still to cut the plaster?

986
01:44:18,583 --> 01:44:20,749
When will you cut it?

987
01:44:21,333 --> 01:44:26,457
ln a few days. Now rest or
l'll have to lock you in.

988
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:31,832
Thank god he's left!
Now l'm going to lock you in.

989
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:34,457
Now tell me the story.

990
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:39,582
Thakur and Sultan walked
into the eatery.

991
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:41,999
They walked in and you asked
Thakur... 'Recognise me'?

992
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:45,290
They fired and you fired back.
Now proceed further.

993
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:49,124
Then l caught Thakur and
we started fighting.

994
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,707
Wow!! Then?

995
01:44:51,416 --> 01:44:55,790
l had him pinned down but l
was attacked from behind.

996
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:56,915
Then?

997
01:44:57,791 --> 01:45:00,457
He choked me so l had
to let him go.

998
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:02,499
You let him go?

999
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:04,665
l didn't want to!

1000
01:45:05,291 --> 01:45:11,207
My hand was on his shirt
pocket and it tore...

1001
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:15,207
And then?

1002
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:27,040
Go on! What happened?

1003
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:30,249
What are you doing?

1004
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:34,499
Do you've your car?
- Yes. But why?

1005
01:45:34,958 --> 01:45:36,415
Give me my shoes.

1006
01:45:37,625 --> 01:45:39,790
Shoes? What have shoes
to do with the story?

1007
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:46,832
Here! Are you crazy?

1008
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:58,415
Be careful!

1009
01:45:59,833 --> 01:46:02,707
This is where l had
pinned him down

1010
01:46:03,541 --> 01:46:07,457
When the pocket tore off
something fell from it.

1011
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:09,665
lt fell somewhere here.

1012
01:46:12,125 --> 01:46:12,832
Where?

1013
01:46:26,833 --> 01:46:27,457
What is it?

1014
01:46:27,916 --> 01:46:30,040
Someone's horoscope. - Whose?

1015
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,624
Bala Thakur's? - Yes! lt's his!

1016
01:46:36,375 --> 01:46:41,957
lt is written by Ram Bandhu Gupta
from Bahid, Rajasthan.

1017
01:46:46,708 --> 01:46:51,832
He wants a map of Raiasthan
and all the evidence again.

1018
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,874
Hurry up! He has arrived!

1019
01:46:59,916 --> 01:47:01,040
Good evening, sir.

1020
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:03,374
What about the peppers?

1021
01:47:03,791 --> 01:47:06,249
They're from Raiasthan
and North Gujarat.

1022
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,624
The sand isn't salty and so,
it's from Rajasthan.

1023
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:10,249
This horoscope too
is from Rajasthan.

1024
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,999
Bala Thakur's horoscope.
Someone in Bahid wrote it.

1025
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:17,374
See this.

1026
01:47:18,083 --> 01:47:20,457
Do you know where Bahid is?
ln Rajasthan.

1027
01:47:21,875 --> 01:47:25,790
Here... on the border of
lndia and Pakistan.

1028
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:32,957
Yadav! Go to Bahid and find
this astrologer...

1029
01:47:33,333 --> 01:47:36,207
...who has clients all
the way to Bombay.

1030
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:37,665
When do we leave?

1031
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:39,832
Sorry, sir!

1032
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,707
We'll meet at the guest house
this evening. - Ok.

1033
01:47:55,541 --> 01:47:56,457
See you!

1034
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:05,624
Sire! What's my future! Am l
suffering for my past sins?

1035
01:48:07,416 --> 01:48:09,582
ln your past birth you
were a policeman.

1036
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,790
Was l a constable? - What?

1037
01:48:12,875 --> 01:48:18,915
Astrologer Gupta says l'll be
a policeman in this birth.

1038
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,999
He's no astrologer!

1039
01:48:21,833 --> 01:48:23,832
He's a con man!

1040
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:28,040
Smuggling is his real business.

1041
01:48:29,458 --> 01:48:38,040
He's Mirchi.
Selling pepper is a front.

1042
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:42,457
Both peppers are of the
same quality. Trust me.

1043
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:44,082
Trust me.

1044
01:48:44,291 --> 01:48:47,165
Your price is too high.

1045
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:49,582
Mirchi's price is lower.

1046
01:48:49,833 --> 01:48:55,290
- He can even give it for free.
- What do you mean?

1047
01:48:55,708 --> 01:49:02,290
l'm a pepper trader while he
uses pepper as a cover.

1048
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:06,915
Will you chew some tobacco?

1049
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:13,582
This is for kids.
l'm looking for the real stuff.

1050
01:49:13,833 --> 01:49:18,707
Real stuff?
You get everything here. - Where?

1051
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,915
Go to Mirchi's office.

1052
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:23,624
Mirchi's office?

1053
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,707
l'll wait here. Be quick.

1054
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:33,415
Come in.
Meet my brother. - Some other time.

1055
01:49:34,166 --> 01:49:39,874
lf he finds out you didn't
come in, he'll scold me.

1056
01:49:43,416 --> 01:49:45,374
Surprise!

1057
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:51,874
Happy birthday to you.

1058
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,290
Happy birthday dear... - Thank you.

1059
01:49:56,125 --> 01:49:59,249
Happy birthday to you.

1060
01:50:54,250 --> 01:51:06,332
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.

1061
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:18,415
Love, our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.

1062
01:51:19,833 --> 01:51:32,374
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.

1063
01:51:54,625 --> 01:52:00,499
Let's embrace in song...

1064
01:52:01,416 --> 01:52:07,415
...and dream in unison.

1065
01:52:07,666 --> 01:52:20,207
Let's embrace in song
and dream in unison.

1066
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:26,332
The sweet pain in our hearts
beat to this rare elixir.

1067
01:52:27,291 --> 01:52:38,874
Love, our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.

1068
01:52:40,708 --> 01:52:53,165
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.

1069
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:40,790
My heart feels your dreams your
heart feels my dreams.

1070
01:53:41,333 --> 01:53:46,832
Lost am l as our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.

1071
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:59,665
Love, our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.

1072
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:12,832
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.

1073
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:25,374
Love, our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.

1074
01:54:27,041 --> 01:54:39,332
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.

1075
01:54:44,583 --> 01:54:48,665
Someone to see you, Ajay!

1076
01:54:48,833 --> 01:54:53,040
Good evening, sir. - You're late!
You were to come at seven!

1077
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:55,415
Sorry!
There was work at the office!

1078
01:54:56,458 --> 01:55:00,874
Yadav needs you in Bahid.
lt's urgent!

1079
01:55:01,708 --> 01:55:03,624
Bahid in Rajasthan? - Yes!

1080
01:55:04,291 --> 01:55:06,415
Gulfam Hasan is there right now.

1081
01:55:06,541 --> 01:55:07,249
Where? ln Bahid?

1082
01:55:07,375 --> 01:55:11,040
Yes!
His ancestral house is near Bahid.

1083
01:55:11,791 --> 01:55:16,124
Will you deliver my letter to him?

1084
01:55:16,333 --> 01:55:17,374
Sure, he'll.

1085
01:55:18,625 --> 01:55:19,540
Don't mind...

1086
01:55:20,208 --> 01:55:20,790
Sure.

1087
01:55:36,125 --> 01:55:37,332
Where's Mirchi?

1088
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:45,665
l'm ACP Rathod.

1089
01:55:47,208 --> 01:55:50,624
ACP Rathod from Mumbai?
From so far?

1090
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:54,624
Yes!
Some jobs lead you far enough!

1091
01:55:55,166 --> 01:55:57,207
Of course!

1092
01:55:57,875 --> 01:55:58,999
Do you know him?

1093
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:04,124
No... who is he?

1094
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:06,290
And him?

1095
01:56:08,958 --> 01:56:09,749
No.

1096
01:56:10,875 --> 01:56:13,415
So you wrote his horoscope
without knowing him.

1097
01:56:17,166 --> 01:56:20,832
This is your chance to confess!

1098
01:56:21,583 --> 01:56:23,457
No one can save you after this.

1099
01:56:26,291 --> 01:56:29,832
Many people come to me to get
their horoscopes written.

1100
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:32,665
lf you wish l can also
write your horoscope.

1101
01:56:33,083 --> 01:56:36,249
And l won't dare ask if you're
a constable or an ACP.

1102
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:39,874
Also, l never take the
law into my hands.

1103
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:45,499
But if l want to, l can write
the horoscope of the law.

1104
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:52,540
Think it over for we know
everything about you.

1105
01:56:54,458 --> 01:57:01,749
lf you don't fall in line we too
can write your horoscope.

1106
01:57:05,291 --> 01:57:10,165
Saturn has turned retrograde!
How did this happen?

1107
01:57:15,333 --> 01:57:16,957
l think we're on the right track.

1108
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,540
Stay here! Keep me informed
of his every move.

1109
01:57:29,166 --> 01:57:34,124
God be praised!
What a lovely coincidence!

1110
01:57:35,416 --> 01:57:38,790
Last time you gave me a lost
childhood treasure.

1111
01:57:39,208 --> 01:57:43,165
Today, like an angel, you
bring excellent news!

1112
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:45,707
Please! l'm just human.

1113
01:57:45,875 --> 01:57:48,207
No! You're an angel!

1114
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,999
A million copies of the
songs you gave me...

1115
01:57:51,041 --> 01:57:53,124
...are being released by Roshan.

1116
01:57:54,041 --> 01:57:55,249
One million!

1117
01:57:57,083 --> 01:58:00,249
This honour and admiration from
fans is thanks to you.

1118
01:58:00,416 --> 01:58:05,332
No! lt's thanks to your music
which is so similar to ours.

1119
01:58:05,416 --> 01:58:07,790
lt's not just similar.
lt's the same!

1120
01:58:08,166 --> 01:58:11,582
My music and my poetry
are rooted here.

1121
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:16,999
Urdu was born in lndia and
so was classical music.

1122
01:58:18,666 --> 01:58:22,040
Why do you live all alone
in this house?

1123
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:25,832
l'm never alone. Memories of my
ancestors keep me company.

1124
01:58:27,041 --> 01:58:28,915
This is my ancestral home.

1125
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,915
We lost it during the partition.

1126
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,332
Thanks to Roshan l'm permitted
to live here sometimes.

1127
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:44,082
Every moment l spend here is
worth a lifetime to me!

1128
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:49,457
- Any special request for supper?
- Ask our guest.

1129
01:58:49,666 --> 01:58:52,207
No, thank you.
l must leave. - Where?

1130
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,540
Back to Mumbai.

1131
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:57,540
Mumbai?
So you didn't come here to see me?

1132
01:58:57,625 --> 01:58:59,499
Well! l had some work here.

1133
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:05,915
You'll not steal my happiness.
You'll stay here tonight.

1134
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,749
But Gulfam sir...

1135
01:59:06,833 --> 01:59:11,374
Tradition here is that guests
can come at their own will...

1136
01:59:11,458 --> 01:59:13,624
...but can leave only at
the will of the host.

1137
01:59:14,708 --> 01:59:20,207
l promise to do the same before
l leave your county.

1138
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:38,874
Mirchi!

1139
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:41,249
At this hour?

1140
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,665
Sire! - What is it?

1141
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:48,415
Sire!

1142
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:54,165
Punish me if l'm at fault...

1143
01:59:54,833 --> 01:59:56,999
...but don't play games with me.

1144
01:59:58,333 --> 02:00:01,915
You've ruined my sleep.
Tell me what's the matter?

1145
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:06,290
A man comes from Mumbai and
threatened to arrest me.

1146
02:00:07,916 --> 02:00:10,499
Now l find that he's your guest.

1147
02:00:11,583 --> 02:00:13,749
What am l to make of it?

1148
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:17,332
Are you talking about Ajay?

1149
02:00:17,833 --> 02:00:21,249
Not just Ajay!
He's ACP Ajay Singh Rathod.

1150
02:00:21,875 --> 02:00:24,165
lt was he who seized our
entire consignment.

1151
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:38,374
ls he the one?

1152
02:00:46,791 --> 02:00:47,707
Yes.

1153
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:14,082
l can kill him right now and
buy him in the desert...

1154
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:15,665
...no one will know!

1155
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:17,415
No. He's a friend...

1156
02:01:20,083 --> 02:01:22,332
...and killing a friend is treason.

1157
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:26,082
lt's a big crime to kill
a police officer.

1158
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:30,040
l'll not get entangled with
the law of this county.

1159
02:01:33,791 --> 02:01:38,499
Don't worry. l'll deal with him.

1160
02:01:40,708 --> 02:01:43,749
l'll handle him with
my friendship.

1161
02:01:49,125 --> 02:01:53,999
Peanuts!
Peanuts for sale! Who's that?

1162
02:01:54,083 --> 02:01:57,582
Where were you all these days?
- l left to get married.

1163
02:01:57,916 --> 02:02:00,290
Wife told me to change
my career so l did.

1164
02:02:01,208 --> 02:02:01,999
Was l wrong?

1165
02:02:02,791 --> 02:02:04,999
Recognise any of these guys?

1166
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,624
Sir!

1167
02:02:07,291 --> 02:02:10,790
God! Death can change the
look of a man. - Be quick!

1168
02:02:11,041 --> 02:02:15,957
Most of these guys were in
and out of Victoria House.

1169
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:19,499
Victoria House.
- lt's next to Sangam Bar.

1170
02:02:29,625 --> 02:02:33,540
We must foster brotherhood and
love been our to nations.

1171
02:02:34,083 --> 02:02:38,707
Politics has its place but art
and culture must have its own.

1172
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,124
Yes! We too wish to have
such cultural exchanges.

1173
02:02:44,375 --> 02:02:45,832
Sure! Why not?

1174
02:02:48,541 --> 02:02:52,749
Hello... how do you do?

1175
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,832
This is a friend who wishes
your blessings.

1176
02:02:56,875 --> 02:02:57,957
How is the general?

1177
02:02:58,250 --> 02:03:00,999
He's fine and sends you his
regards. He's disturbed.

1178
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:09,540
He feels that your music has made
you forget your mission.

1179
02:03:10,583 --> 02:03:12,415
He's told me to remind you...

1180
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,165
Remind me?
Thank you for reminding me.

1181
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:19,999
Assure him that Gulfam is aware
of his responsibilities.

1182
02:03:21,333 --> 02:03:21,999
Yes!

1183
02:03:22,958 --> 02:03:28,957
You promised to create
a hundred Veerans... But?

1184
02:03:29,125 --> 02:03:29,749
But what?

1185
02:03:31,041 --> 02:03:34,707
But there is only one and
he too is undependable.

1186
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:49,457
l was born here and understand
the realities of lndia better.

1187
02:03:51,375 --> 02:03:52,499
The war that l'm waging
is the one...

1188
02:03:52,583 --> 02:03:53,624
...that you should be fighting.

1189
02:03:55,041 --> 02:03:56,749
Tell the General that it's
easy to talk nonsense...

1190
02:03:56,833 --> 02:03:58,582
...sitting in a guarded
room in Karachi.

1191
02:03:59,541 --> 02:04:02,665
lf he's desperate let him come
here. l'll trade places.

1192
02:04:02,833 --> 02:04:05,207
Please don't get upset!

1193
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:08,040
The general has full faith
in your abilities.

1194
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:13,124
That's why he has trusted a
migrant mohajir like you.

1195
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:17,999
l must meet Gulfam. - Sure. Go on.

1196
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,707
Welcome, Ajay! This is Dr. Baig!

1197
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,832
Baig is a poet at heart and
a bureaucrat by profession.

1198
02:04:28,541 --> 02:04:31,040
He has come all the way from
Karachi to attend this meet.

1199
02:04:31,958 --> 02:04:37,040
See that gentleman there with
Gulfam Hasan? He's ACP Rathod.

1200
02:04:37,333 --> 02:04:39,915
He's Gulfam's close
friend and is...

1201
02:04:40,291 --> 02:04:42,749
...with the Police Crime Branch.

1202
02:04:43,583 --> 02:04:47,540
Get him a plum posting so that
his life will be made.

1203
02:04:47,708 --> 02:04:49,915
l understand. lt will be done.

1204
02:04:50,041 --> 02:04:54,832
With so many fans in lndia you
must be mobbed in Pakistan.

1205
02:04:55,958 --> 02:05:02,249
l've many fans but l'm still
looked on as a mohajir.

1206
02:05:02,875 --> 02:05:06,249
Don't mind... what is a mohajir?

1207
02:05:06,791 --> 02:05:07,707
Mohajir?

1208
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:11,624
They're Muslims from lndia who
sought refuge in Pakistan...

1209
02:05:11,708 --> 02:05:14,207
...in the hope of living as equals
in a new Muslim nation.

1210
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:19,499
lnstead of being welcomed they
were rejected as mohajirs.

1211
02:05:21,208 --> 02:05:26,207
Fifty years have passed we're
still mohajirs. Not Pakistanis.

1212
02:05:28,708 --> 02:05:30,290
Am l right, Mr. Baig?

1213
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:34,999
l refute that. You're like a
precious jewel to Pakistan.

1214
02:05:57,083 --> 02:05:58,749
Hell! That's Rathod!

1215
02:06:00,791 --> 02:06:03,832
Get everyone out! l'm leaving.

1216
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,874
Stop. Quick!

1217
02:06:06,583 --> 02:06:08,207
Get out. lt's a police raid.

1218
02:06:15,708 --> 02:06:17,665
Police! Tell Shiva to leave!

1219
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:32,999
Shiva! Police!

1220
02:06:46,583 --> 02:06:47,499
Let's go!

1221
02:07:05,458 --> 02:07:06,207
Stop!

1222
02:07:52,166 --> 02:07:52,790
He got away!

1223
02:07:52,875 --> 02:07:54,915
Never mind!
We now know their hideout.

1224
02:07:56,291 --> 02:08:00,040
Gather all evidence and
seal the building.

1225
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:03,999
We've caught a few men.

1226
02:08:19,208 --> 02:08:21,665
Anyone talked yet? - No, sir.

1227
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:23,874
l came into town yesterday.
lsn't it?

1228
02:08:23,958 --> 02:08:28,540
l'm just an electrician.
l'm innocent, sir.

1229
02:08:28,875 --> 02:08:31,374
So none of you're involved?
- No, sir!

1230
02:08:32,083 --> 02:08:33,499
Okay. Kill them all.

1231
02:08:34,083 --> 02:08:34,790
Sir!

1232
02:08:35,125 --> 02:08:36,874
Shoot them and report
it as an encounter.

1233
02:08:39,333 --> 02:08:43,874
Any last wish? Feed them.
Fried Chicken? Kababs? Booze?

1234
02:08:44,208 --> 02:08:45,790
Give them what they want

1235
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:47,957
One minute, sir!

1236
02:08:48,166 --> 02:08:52,332
l swear l'm innocent!
Believe me! l've children!

1237
02:08:52,583 --> 02:08:57,499
This is your last chance. Confess.

1238
02:08:58,083 --> 02:09:01,540
We're poor people!
We didn't do anything!

1239
02:09:01,666 --> 02:09:04,999
l'm innocent!

1240
02:09:06,375 --> 02:09:09,124
lt's no use, sir.
They won't speak.

1241
02:09:12,083 --> 02:09:14,665
Go ahead and shoot them.

1242
02:09:14,916 --> 02:09:15,832
What... you mean it?

1243
02:09:16,625 --> 02:09:18,207
But the bullet shouldn't wound.

1244
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,707
Fire to inches away from the ear.

1245
02:09:22,916 --> 02:09:23,790
Ok, sir.

1246
02:09:24,458 --> 02:09:26,749
Stop crying.
There's still time. Speak up.

1247
02:09:35,166 --> 02:09:37,124
Don't kill me please.

1248
02:09:37,208 --> 02:09:41,040
Don't kill me. Please.

1249
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:50,165
l'll speak, sir.

1250
02:09:52,666 --> 02:09:55,415
Take the others out. - Get going!

1251
02:09:58,833 --> 02:09:59,790
Speak up!

1252
02:10:00,125 --> 02:10:04,207
All l know is the stuff
comes from Rajasthan.

1253
02:10:04,916 --> 02:10:05,790
Where is Sultan?

1254
02:10:05,916 --> 02:10:07,624
He's run away to Pakistan.

1255
02:10:08,375 --> 02:10:10,124
Who runs the business now? - Haji.

1256
02:10:10,625 --> 02:10:11,332
Who's Haji?

1257
02:10:11,416 --> 02:10:14,249
He runs a travel agency
from Victoria House.

1258
02:10:15,333 --> 02:10:16,457
When is the stuff expected again?

1259
02:10:16,541 --> 02:10:21,874
l don't know.
Haji just returned from Rajasthan.

1260
02:10:25,333 --> 02:10:26,749
Take him away!

1261
02:10:33,666 --> 02:10:34,957
Salim! - Yes, sir.

1262
02:10:35,958 --> 02:10:37,832
lnform Yadav in Bahid that
l need daily reports...

1263
02:10:37,916 --> 02:10:39,957
...from the lntelligence
Bureau in Rajasthan.

1264
02:10:40,666 --> 02:10:41,874
Check out who Haji is!

1265
02:10:42,333 --> 02:10:44,540
Keep tabs on him...

1266
02:10:44,916 --> 02:10:47,790
...but don't arrest him till
l order. - Ok, sir.

1267
02:11:01,625 --> 02:11:02,582
What is it, Mirchi?

1268
02:11:02,916 --> 02:11:05,749
You promised to take
care of your friend.

1269
02:11:06,333 --> 02:11:07,999
He has caught up with Haji...

1270
02:11:08,791 --> 02:11:11,249
...and also raided Victoria House.

1271
02:11:12,083 --> 02:11:15,999
Haji wants to get Salim
on our side...

1272
02:11:16,333 --> 02:11:19,040
...and then kill your friend.

1273
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:23,707
Don't do that! lt will be our
loss if Ajay is killed.

1274
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:24,957
Then what do we do?

1275
02:11:25,291 --> 02:11:30,374
Put him out of action.
Break his leg again!

1276
02:11:31,041 --> 02:11:33,957
Deliver goods to Veeran
in the meantime.

1277
02:11:35,458 --> 02:11:37,499
l'll get him out of this
case very soon!

1278
02:11:38,708 --> 02:11:44,915
Tell Haji to break his leg...
only his leg. - Ok, sire.

1279
02:12:14,416 --> 02:12:16,957
Greetings, Mr. Salim!

1280
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:19,332
Greetings. Tell me.

1281
02:12:21,333 --> 02:12:27,457
lt's painful to see
a fellow Muslim...

1282
02:12:28,333 --> 02:12:29,999
...working with infidels...

1283
02:12:31,083 --> 02:12:32,165
...against us!

1284
02:12:34,041 --> 02:12:37,499
Muslim? Do you know what it means?

1285
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,790
Yes! One who believes in lslam.
- Not just that.

1286
02:12:44,541 --> 02:12:47,374
A true Muslim must have
a pure conscience...

1287
02:12:48,166 --> 02:12:51,624
One whose conscience is
alive at all times.

1288
02:12:52,291 --> 02:12:54,874
A conscience as solid as rock...

1289
02:12:55,333 --> 02:12:57,040
...and as pure as dew.

1290
02:12:57,375 --> 02:13:01,874
Speak of being Muslim only if
you've such a conscience.

1291
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,082
You're complicating matters.
l believe...

1292
02:13:06,416 --> 02:13:08,957
l believe in live and let live.

1293
02:13:10,083 --> 02:13:13,957
We tried to reason with Rathod.

1294
02:13:15,291 --> 02:13:17,540
We were willing to pay as
much as half-a-million.

1295
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,999
So you've put a price
tag on ACP Rathod...

1296
02:13:22,333 --> 02:13:24,457
What's the price tag
for your county?

1297
02:13:25,333 --> 02:13:27,249
How many pieces of silver
will you sell it for?

1298
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:29,957
l'm a businessman...

1299
02:13:30,750 --> 02:13:33,665
...and l believe in fair play.

1300
02:13:34,541 --> 02:13:36,915
And never with one of our own.

1301
02:13:38,208 --> 02:13:42,957
We're both Muslims.
We can sort things out.

1302
02:13:43,208 --> 02:13:47,415
Don't equate me with you!

1303
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,957
l'm not like you!

1304
02:13:50,916 --> 02:13:52,457
You're a traitor!

1305
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:59,124
Because of a few Muslims like
you we're all suspects.

1306
02:14:00,333 --> 02:14:01,957
Men like you betray
the county and...

1307
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,249
...the whole community suffers.
- Enough of lectures!

1308
02:14:06,541 --> 02:14:09,415
Some day you'll come
to your senses...

1309
02:14:10,583 --> 02:14:12,749
...like your friend Rathod
would've realised by now.

1310
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:13,832
What do you mean?

1311
02:14:14,166 --> 02:14:16,040
Go, save him!

1312
02:14:16,166 --> 02:14:19,540
lf you hurt him l'll
not spare you!

1313
02:14:26,291 --> 02:14:28,249
Don't mind, how do l drive?

1314
02:14:29,125 --> 02:14:31,457
We're home safe and sound!
- Thank you.

1315
02:14:32,416 --> 02:14:35,999
l'm safe and sound!
What about others!

1316
02:14:46,208 --> 02:14:47,707
Hey stay quiet!

1317
02:14:54,166 --> 02:15:00,540
Help!

1318
02:15:02,083 --> 02:15:04,124
Help! Stop them!

1319
02:15:04,416 --> 02:15:06,082
Please don't hurt my son!

1320
02:15:06,166 --> 02:15:08,124
Please stop them from
hurting my son!

1321
02:15:10,541 --> 02:15:11,415
Hold him.

1322
02:15:15,625 --> 02:15:17,499
Please don't hurt my son!

1323
02:15:18,041 --> 02:15:21,249
Please don't hurt my son! - Stop.

1324
02:15:21,625 --> 02:15:22,665
Help!

1325
02:15:25,333 --> 02:15:26,915
Shiva! The police! Run!

1326
02:15:37,750 --> 02:15:39,624
Salim! Catch them!

1327
02:15:41,833 --> 02:15:43,207
What are you doing? Ajay!

1328
02:15:46,083 --> 02:15:50,040
Ajay! Wait!

1329
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:53,290
They got away! - Get the jeep!

1330
02:15:53,458 --> 02:15:56,040
We can get them at any time.
- Get the jeep!

1331
02:15:56,208 --> 02:15:59,499
Yadav has returned with vital
information. - Listen to me!

1332
02:15:59,666 --> 02:16:00,832
Mum! l'm fine!

1333
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,999
Let them be.
We've enough to nail them.

1334
02:16:08,125 --> 02:16:16,040
The villages on the border are
conduits for drugs and guns

1335
02:16:16,916 --> 02:16:22,624
Unmanned camels smuggle the
contraband across the border.

1336
02:16:23,375 --> 02:16:23,707
How?

1337
02:16:23,958 --> 02:16:26,415
The camels are specially trained
to travel on their own...

1338
02:16:26,708 --> 02:16:28,957
...they fery the stuff across
without human supervision.

1339
02:16:29,166 --> 02:16:32,040
lntelligence reports suggest
the presence of...

1340
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,374
...a few Pakistani spies
in these villages.

1341
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,249
This one is Captain Javed Abbas...

1342
02:16:39,291 --> 02:16:41,582
...operating in Bahid as Shafi.

1343
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:50,290
And this is Maior Aslam Baig.

1344
02:16:52,375 --> 02:16:56,124
He visited lndia recently
to attend a poetry meet.

1345
02:16:58,708 --> 02:17:00,707
- What's the matter, sir?
- Nothing.

1346
02:17:01,875 --> 02:17:05,540
lntelligence has intercepted
and taped a message.

1347
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:11,207
A huge consignment of arms
will arrive in a few days.

1348
02:17:11,708 --> 02:17:14,040
We should prepare to
leave for Rajasthan.

1349
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:17,957
Yes. l'll talk to the DCP.

1350
02:17:18,291 --> 02:17:19,874
Even l want to talk to you.

1351
02:17:22,291 --> 02:17:23,040
Come in.

1352
02:17:30,916 --> 02:17:32,874
Hurt your leg? - Nothing much, sir.

1353
02:17:33,375 --> 02:17:34,249
lf you...

1354
02:17:36,166 --> 02:17:37,665
lf you didn't want take
on this case...

1355
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:38,999
...you should've informed me.

1356
02:17:39,333 --> 02:17:40,832
l'd have arranged a lucrative
posting for you.

1357
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:41,999
What do you mean, sir?

1358
02:17:42,083 --> 02:17:48,624
You pretend to be honest and then
angle for plum postings.

1359
02:17:49,833 --> 02:17:51,165
l haven't angled for anything.

1360
02:17:51,375 --> 02:17:53,707
Then why did l get this order?

1361
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,165
lt's a ploy to get
me off this case...

1362
02:17:59,083 --> 02:18:00,582
...as l'm close to solving it.

1363
02:18:01,041 --> 02:18:02,707
l must leave for Rajasthan
immediately.

1364
02:18:03,875 --> 02:18:05,790
Believe me, sir. Trust me.

1365
02:18:06,708 --> 02:18:08,082
l'm being shunted, sir.

1366
02:18:08,916 --> 02:18:10,082
Let me go. Please.

1367
02:18:12,833 --> 02:18:15,749
Fine! This order stays with me.

1368
02:18:16,208 --> 02:18:17,624
You've not received it.

1369
02:18:19,333 --> 02:18:22,415
No! l shan't let you
go! Forget this job!

1370
02:18:22,958 --> 02:18:25,207
You even got shot at!
- Mum! l must go!

1371
02:18:25,375 --> 02:18:27,457
Why can't they send someone else?

1372
02:18:27,958 --> 02:18:29,957
You were attacked!

1373
02:18:30,916 --> 02:18:33,332
You don't care enough!
See the way he limps.

1374
02:18:33,583 --> 02:18:36,874
You're hurt but you still
want to go to Rajasthan!

1375
02:18:37,458 --> 02:18:38,874
l won't allow it!

1376
02:18:39,125 --> 02:18:41,457
Stop him!
Why doesn't anyone stop him?

1377
02:18:41,875 --> 02:18:43,124
l won't let you go!

1378
02:19:04,708 --> 02:19:05,624
Don't mind.

1379
02:19:23,416 --> 02:19:25,915
l won't let you go!

1380
02:19:29,958 --> 02:19:33,790
l've lost one son!
You're all l've left!

1381
02:19:35,416 --> 02:19:36,165
Goodbye, Mother!

1382
02:19:36,250 --> 02:19:38,749
No! l won't let you go!

1383
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:37,790
"l'm sleepless all night!
As l long to be your bride!"

1384
02:20:45,583 --> 02:20:56,457
"Gift me pearls and diamonds!
As l long to be your bride!"

1385
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:51,874
"Will you die for me? ...oh yes!"

1386
02:21:51,958 --> 02:21:55,665
"Will you entice me... oh yes!"

1387
02:21:55,750 --> 02:22:01,999
"Want to save your life...
then make me your Queen!"

1388
02:22:03,583 --> 02:22:06,707
"Are you true to love... oh yes!"

1389
02:22:06,958 --> 02:22:10,540
"Live a life of love...
if you wish to live!"

1390
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:18,999
"Hold me to your lips...
if you wish to live!"

1391
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:23,165
"l'm sleepless all night!
As l long to be your bride!"

1392
02:22:23,541 --> 02:22:34,374
"Gift me pearls and diamonds!
As l long to be your bride!"

1393
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:02,957
The stuff has arrived!

1394
02:24:04,416 --> 02:24:06,415
Be careful this time.

1395
02:24:46,166 --> 02:24:47,874
Rathod is here!

1396
02:24:50,583 --> 02:24:51,749
Come with me!

1397
02:25:01,958 --> 02:25:03,540
Salim! - Yes... - Shafi...

1398
02:25:10,458 --> 02:25:11,207
Come.

1399
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:12,999
Come with me!

1400
02:25:15,666 --> 02:25:17,249
Go by the godown!

1401
02:25:17,583 --> 02:25:19,165
Come with me!

1402
02:25:35,125 --> 02:25:36,582
Where's the boss? - l don't know.

1403
02:25:36,666 --> 02:25:37,874
Where's he?

1404
02:27:01,833 --> 02:27:02,499
Come

1405
02:27:09,708 --> 02:27:11,999
Today you'll die!

1406
02:27:20,125 --> 02:27:21,874
ACP Rathod.

1407
02:27:46,291 --> 02:27:47,249
Hurry!

1408
02:27:53,875 --> 02:27:55,665
He has escaped.

1409
02:27:56,541 --> 02:27:57,957
l know where they're headed.

1410
02:28:05,625 --> 02:28:07,457
ACP Rathod.
Crime Branch. Mumbai Police.

1411
02:28:08,083 --> 02:28:10,665
Seize all this stuff!
We're going to Bahid Fort.

1412
02:28:10,875 --> 02:28:13,040
Ask the control room to
send your forces there.

1413
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:14,165
C'mon!

1414
02:28:14,750 --> 02:28:15,332
Get up!

1415
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:17,749
Come on!

1416
02:28:17,833 --> 02:28:19,165
Control room... hello...

1417
02:29:16,666 --> 02:29:17,665
Get out of here!

1418
02:29:17,791 --> 02:29:20,165
l can't!
They've blocked the entrance.

1419
02:29:23,958 --> 02:29:26,915
Go up! Let me know when the
back-up forces arrive.

1420
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,957
Yadav! Baiju! Stay here!
Salim! Come with me.

1421
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:32,499
Move.

1422
02:29:38,125 --> 02:29:43,040
Stop firing!

1423
02:29:43,250 --> 02:29:45,540
Ask your men to stop firing!

1424
02:29:45,666 --> 02:29:47,540
Yes, Sire. Stop firing!

1425
02:30:00,375 --> 02:30:01,499
Gulfam Hasan!

1426
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:05,582
You, Major Baig and Mirchi Seth...

1427
02:30:05,916 --> 02:30:08,332
...will be arrested for spreading
terrorism in this county.

1428
02:30:09,666 --> 02:30:12,624
You cannot escape! Surrender!

1429
02:30:12,708 --> 02:30:18,124
How can you accuse us,
Ajay, without any evidence?

1430
02:30:18,291 --> 02:30:20,957
Evidence is this traitor Mirchi...

1431
02:30:21,541 --> 02:30:23,124
...and Haji, who is in our custody.

1432
02:30:25,916 --> 02:30:28,999
Who is he? l don't know him!

1433
02:30:30,666 --> 02:30:33,665
l do know Mirchi because he
lives in the neighbourhood.

1434
02:30:34,041 --> 02:30:36,374
You can ask him what
he's doing here.

1435
02:30:37,708 --> 02:30:42,124
What evidence is this?
l don't know Mirchi or Haji.

1436
02:30:42,416 --> 02:30:43,999
But you do know Shafi. Right?

1437
02:30:48,541 --> 02:30:51,749
A captain in your spy agency lSl,
where you're a Major.

1438
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:54,374
We've caught him red-handed
smuggling arms.

1439
02:30:55,166 --> 02:30:58,249
Now your terrorist acts will
be exposed to the world.

1440
02:30:58,708 --> 02:31:02,540
l'm a diplomat representing
my county...

1441
02:31:02,833 --> 02:31:06,540
...a guest who is here on your
Government's invitation.

1442
02:31:07,583 --> 02:31:10,040
l have diplomatic immunity.

1443
02:31:10,583 --> 02:31:15,124
Touch me and you'll see the
repercussions in lslamabad.

1444
02:31:17,125 --> 02:31:21,249
Let's wait! Once the force
arrives, how will they escape?

1445
02:31:22,208 --> 02:31:24,249
We don't have enough evidence
against Gulfam Hasan.

1446
02:31:25,208 --> 02:31:26,499
He'll get away scot free.

1447
02:31:27,416 --> 02:31:30,249
Let's kill them and claim that
we did it in self-defence.

1448
02:31:30,833 --> 02:31:31,457
No!

1449
02:31:32,750 --> 02:31:34,665
l won't let them die so easily.

1450
02:31:35,125 --> 02:31:37,999
The force is here!

1451
02:31:47,333 --> 02:31:49,082
Salim! Give me your gun!

1452
02:31:54,458 --> 02:31:57,415
You don't seem to understand
l've diplomatic immunity.

1453
02:31:57,583 --> 02:31:59,290
To hell with your diplomatic
immunity!

1454
02:32:00,291 --> 02:32:02,582
That can be of use if you
live through this!

1455
02:32:03,083 --> 02:32:05,290
l'll give you iust one
last chance to live...

1456
02:32:06,458 --> 02:32:11,540
...this Gulfam Hasan whom
we loved and trusted...

1457
02:32:11,875 --> 02:32:13,874
...has cheated me and
betrayed my county!

1458
02:32:14,416 --> 02:32:15,915
l won't let him walk away alive!

1459
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:20,832
lf you want to live...
kill Gulfam Hasan!

1460
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:22,999
l'll then free you and Shafi.

1461
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,790
But why don't you kill him?

1462
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:31,290
The law here forbids it!

1463
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:35,749
What's the guarantee you'll
free me after l kill him?

1464
02:32:35,958 --> 02:32:37,290
What nonsense is this?

1465
02:32:37,375 --> 02:32:40,874
You'll have to trust me.
You've no option.

1466
02:32:41,708 --> 02:32:44,582
Sir! The force will be
here in five minutes.

1467
02:32:46,083 --> 02:32:47,040
Hurry up, Baig.

1468
02:32:47,333 --> 02:32:49,290
Once the force arrives l'll
not be able to help you.

1469
02:32:50,750 --> 02:32:52,707
Take this gun and kill Gulfam.

1470
02:32:55,958 --> 02:32:57,832
Baig! Baig!

1471
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:01,915
Are you out of your mind?
You want to kill me?

1472
02:33:03,708 --> 02:33:04,999
Don't you know who l'm?

1473
02:33:05,041 --> 02:33:08,915
l know, but a singer can't be
saved at the cost of soldiers.

1474
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:12,082
Your death won't really
affect my county...

1475
02:33:12,166 --> 02:33:14,165
...as you aren't a Pakistani.
You're a mohajir.

1476
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:15,749
ls it?

1477
02:33:16,250 --> 02:33:19,290
Until now wasn't l a mohajir?

1478
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:25,374
Now that your life is at stake
l've become expendable.

1479
02:33:26,708 --> 02:33:28,999
Mirchi! Tell your men to kill him!

1480
02:33:29,083 --> 02:33:31,540
Mirchi! Don't interfere!
lt's between them.

1481
02:33:31,875 --> 02:33:36,082
l'll make you a state witness.
Stand by us. That's the best.

1482
02:33:38,666 --> 02:33:42,457
Ajay! l saved your life
ice from this man.

1483
02:33:42,625 --> 02:33:44,665
This man who you want to
make a state witness...

1484
02:33:44,833 --> 02:33:47,874
...wanted to kill you!
ls this how you pay me back?

1485
02:33:47,958 --> 02:33:49,124
Ajay! Ajay!

1486
02:34:23,166 --> 02:34:23,957
Ajay!

1487
02:34:26,625 --> 02:34:28,457
You played a game with me.

1488
02:34:33,791 --> 02:34:35,415
l'm defeated.

1489
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,540
You tricked me into killing a man.

1490
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:49,499
l've committed a grave
sin with these hands.

1491
02:34:52,583 --> 02:34:55,207
Today you lay hands on a gun
and realise that it's a sin!

1492
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,874
What about the guns you gave
others to kill innocents?

1493
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,082
Gulfam Hasan, my county gave
you love and respect...

1494
02:35:03,166 --> 02:35:04,790
...gave you adulation...

1495
02:35:05,125 --> 02:35:06,624
...and what did you give in return?

1496
02:35:06,833 --> 02:35:08,999
Terrorism and bloodshed!

1497
02:35:13,166 --> 02:35:16,915
l didn't make you a killer!
You were always one...

1498
02:35:18,208 --> 02:35:20,957
...l just ripped off the mask.

1499
02:35:21,416 --> 02:35:25,082
The world knows that
l'm a true artiste.

1500
02:35:25,291 --> 02:35:28,249
Maybe but from now on
you'll be known...

1501
02:35:28,416 --> 02:35:30,749
...as a traitor and assassin.

1502
02:35:31,333 --> 02:35:34,457
You're a criminal and you'll
be punished for your crime.

1503
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,249
This land on which
you stand today...

1504
02:35:38,833 --> 02:35:40,290
...and order me...

1505
02:35:42,791 --> 02:35:45,749
...was ruled by my ancestors.

1506
02:35:48,416 --> 02:35:51,832
l grew up in this palace...

1507
02:35:53,791 --> 02:35:55,165
We've ruled this land.

1508
02:35:57,333 --> 02:35:59,082
One day, for no reason...

1509
02:36:00,291 --> 02:36:03,457
...we were driven
out like cattle...

1510
02:36:05,416 --> 02:36:08,457
To render families homeless
is a crime.

1511
02:36:09,958 --> 02:36:12,624
To snatch everything from
someone is a crime.

1512
02:36:13,791 --> 02:36:15,999
To orphan children is a crime.

1513
02:36:16,333 --> 02:36:18,749
What they did to us fifty
years ago was a crime!

1514
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,165
Yes! lt was a crime.

1515
02:36:22,041 --> 02:36:24,582
lt was because of the partition.

1516
02:36:25,333 --> 02:36:27,040
You weren't the only one
singled out to suffer.

1517
02:36:27,291 --> 02:36:29,374
Millions were killed,
orphaned and rendered homeless.

1518
02:36:30,083 --> 02:36:31,999
lt happened on both sides
of the divide.

1519
02:36:32,750 --> 02:36:37,499
Sadly some people want to push
us back to the same situation.

1520
02:36:38,291 --> 02:36:40,082
They want to use religion
to divide us again but...

1521
02:36:40,666 --> 02:36:43,665
...we won't let them succeed,
no matter what their religion.

1522
02:36:44,541 --> 02:36:47,832
Gulfam Hasan,
we didn't celebrate the partition.

1523
02:36:48,791 --> 02:36:51,957
We remember it with
sadness and grief.

1524
02:36:53,041 --> 02:36:55,290
We want to forget the past and
rise above that trauma but...

1525
02:36:55,583 --> 02:36:59,332
...you and your kin rip open old
scars to make new wounds.

1526
02:36:59,583 --> 02:37:02,249
And we'll keep doing that!

1527
02:37:04,416 --> 02:37:06,582
For our wounds are deep...

1528
02:37:08,208 --> 02:37:09,790
...and they won't heal so easily.

1529
02:37:11,708 --> 02:37:14,624
l wish that you and your future
generations remember...

1530
02:37:15,125 --> 02:37:19,249
...the atrocities committed
against our community.

1531
02:37:20,625 --> 02:37:24,665
Every time our weapons
rain death...

1532
02:37:25,083 --> 02:37:28,707
...then you'll realise the pain...

1533
02:37:29,583 --> 02:37:32,082
...and the wounds suffered
by our community.

1534
02:37:33,041 --> 02:37:35,374
Stop talking nonsense!

1535
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:39,207
What do you mean by
your community?

1536
02:37:40,250 --> 02:37:44,332
lf you mean Muslims then lndia has
more Muslims than Pakistan.

1537
02:37:45,333 --> 02:37:48,332
Guns do not discriminate.

1538
02:37:48,750 --> 02:37:50,207
Even Muslims die by your bullets.

1539
02:37:51,625 --> 02:37:53,540
Your deeds bring dishonour
to the Muslims in lndia.

1540
02:37:54,208 --> 02:37:57,165
By spreading death,
you aren't helping your community.

1541
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,457
All this talk of community
and religion is a fraud.

1542
02:38:01,750 --> 02:38:05,499
Men like you belong nowhere.
You and this Mirchi Seth!

1543
02:38:06,166 --> 02:38:08,290
He bites the hand that feeds him!

1544
02:38:08,791 --> 02:38:11,707
The rogue was willing
to sell his county.

1545
02:38:14,125 --> 02:38:16,999
People like you are enemies
of humanity.

1546
02:38:32,666 --> 02:38:33,665
Gulfam Hasan.

1547
02:38:35,291 --> 02:38:36,874
l regret...

1548
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,332
...having befriended you.

1549
02:38:44,833 --> 02:38:46,665
Salim, arrest him.

1550
02:40:22,625 --> 02:40:26,040
Gulfam Hasan, the renowned
Pakistani singer, is dead.

1551
02:40:26,250 --> 02:40:29,124
He committed suicide at
Bahid in Rajasthan.

1552
02:40:29,708 --> 02:40:33,457
His fans all over the
world are shocked.

1553
02:40:33,833 --> 02:40:37,374
He'd expressed a desire
to be buried in Bahid...

1554
02:40:37,583 --> 02:40:41,749
...while Pakistan wants his
body to to be returned.

1555
02:40:42,208 --> 02:40:44,749
Government sources link him
to anti-national forces.

1556
02:40:44,958 --> 02:40:47,999
How could an artiste like Gulfam
Hasan do such deeds?

1557
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,374
Artistes are human.

1558
02:40:54,458 --> 02:40:56,040
Some good. Some bad.

1559
02:40:57,625 --> 02:41:03,874
Twinkle twinkle little stars.

1560
02:41:05,083 --> 02:41:07,415
lnspector Salim? Here?

1561
02:41:07,666 --> 02:41:09,124
Yes, but what are you doing here?

1562
02:41:09,208 --> 02:41:11,165
l'm going to Dubai. - Dubai?

1563
02:41:11,541 --> 02:41:14,332
l'm now into import-export.

1564
02:41:15,041 --> 02:41:16,790
Good we met!

1565
02:41:17,375 --> 02:41:20,707
Let me give you one solid tip!

1566
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,874
Remember Veeran?
He's here! - Where?

1567
02:41:25,291 --> 02:41:27,207
Don't mind...
how long is it going to take?

1568
02:41:27,291 --> 02:41:28,499
They should be here soon.

1569
02:41:28,875 --> 02:41:30,457
Mother has made a
delicacy for you.

1570
02:41:30,541 --> 02:41:31,457
Excuse me, sir.

1571
02:41:34,666 --> 02:41:35,499
Veeran?

1572
02:41:39,875 --> 02:41:43,999
Go home and tell Mum l'll
be late for dinner.

1573
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:45,457
Where are you going?

1574
02:41:47,541 --> 02:41:48,999
Something important has come up.

1575
02:41:49,666 --> 02:41:54,165
Don't mind.

1576
