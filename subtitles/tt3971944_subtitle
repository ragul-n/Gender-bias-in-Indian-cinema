1
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,355
''First we used to say sorry and thank you.''

2
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,867
''We used to drink from the same well.''

3
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,531
''First we used to say sorry and thank you.''

4
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,542
''We used to drink from the same well.''

5
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,444
''Now we will show them.
We will taunt them.''

6
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,984
''Now we will show them.
We will taunt them.''

7
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,721
''We will make their daughter
our daughter-in-law.''

8
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,253
''They made many rules and regulations.''

9
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,019
''They fooled naive lndians.''

10
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,023
''They made many rules and regulations.''

11
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,668
''They fooled naive lndians.''

12
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,468
''Now we will teach them alesson.
Theywill serve us.''

13
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,011
''Now we will teach them alesson.
Theywill serve us.''

14
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:36,276
''Now we shall stayhere
and dictateour rules!''

15
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,491
Hi.

16
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,324
These are the fields of my village.

17
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,727
And this is my village.

18
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,763
My village is just
like any other village.

19
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,599
Kids fighting without a reason..

20
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,815
And seniors giving
their unsolicited advices.

21
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:50,651
Obama should've made Osama
apologise before killing him.

22
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,553
True.

23
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:56,322
But my village is more backward
and illiterate than others.

24
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,456
lt still has bathrooms without doors.

25
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,695
Anyone who wishes to visit
it has his own style of signaling.

26
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,838
And the one who is
inside has his own signal.

27
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,004
But did you note something?

28
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,907
My village is illiterate then
why is the sign board in English?

29
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,641
Gents toilet.

30
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,582
Look overthere.

31
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,781
Cattle shit should be thrown here.

32
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,252
These English signboards
have been placed by Mr. Najjar Singh.

33
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,383
And there's along story
behind English signboards.

34
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,511
lt was in the year 1941..

35
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,284
Papa, l wantto eat curd.

36
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,020
Who eats curd at this hour, son?

37
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,353
l wantto eat it!
l want it! l want it! l wantit!

38
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,398
Long live..
- Revolution!

39
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,524
Long live..
- Revolution!

40
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,999
Long live..
- Revolution!

41
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,863
Long live..
- Revolution!

42
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,701
Long live..
- Revolution!

43
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,638
Long live..
- Revolution!

44
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,608
Long live..
- Revolution!

45
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,450
Charge!

46
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:51,571
Being a victim to Englishmen's
assault, his father passed away.

47
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,508
Englishmen!

48
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,717
Najjar Singh was furious, but he
couldn't do anything as he was small.

49
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,887
But hedecided that he
shall seek revenge forthis.

50
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,651
But by the time he grew up, and
was capable enough to seek revenge..

51
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,283
Englishmen had left the country.

52
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,459
His heart was filled
with hatred for foreigners.

53
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,366
Englishmen left but
they left English behind.

54
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,267
Henceto seek revengehe started
writing English at all bad places.

55
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,465
'Do not spit here.'

56
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,599
'Gents toilet.'

57
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,698
'Cattleshit should bethrown here.'

58
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,644
Albert shouldn't get away!
Peterson should never come back!

59
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,806
No, he isn't following any foreigner.

60
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,419
They are making the wild, infiltrating
cattle leave their fields.

61
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,613
They have given them English names.

62
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,722
lt helps them save their harvest
and thrash some English as well.

63
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,827
This poor soul must be wondering
that the English left the country..

64
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,399
..but they got them
trapped into this mess.

65
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,331
Anyway, this is Najjar Singh's mansion.

66
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,701
Thereason for all this decoration?

67
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,970
His eldest grandson is returning from
Canada after completing his education and.

68
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,986
You must be wondering when
Najjar Singh is so against foreigners..

69
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,389
..then how could his grandson
go abroad for education?

70
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,317
Grandpa!

71
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,756
l can't tell you everything, can l?

72
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,316
Here you go!

73
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,028
God bless you.

74
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,597
lts been so long.

75
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,662
lt's okay.
You have returned afterthree years.

76
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,033
Th esoil of this village
wishes to embrace you.

77
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,499
Then it should trouble only him.

78
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,300
Why is it tryingto enter my eyes?

79
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:29,999
l stayhere.

80
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,038
Stop your nonsense, Mann sahib.

81
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,604
You insult people in such
a way that one cannot even object.

82
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,238
You address me as sahib..

83
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,879
Grandpa,
so much decoration to welcome me?

84
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,650

Your engagement? Right away?.

88
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,893
You don't know what it means?

baked bread is served immediately.

90
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,362
lt's for your betrothal ceremony.

91
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,406
Betrothal?

My betrothal ceremony?

93
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,576
Yes.

94
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,547
Where's Kala?
- You want to get engaged to him?

95
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,645
Shut up.

Let's go inside, son.

Okay. He has given
all his trouble to you.

l have brought such
a nice match for my nephew.

105
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,471
l'll slap you if you utter
another word, Mann sahib.

106
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,705
Uncle, either slap
me or address me as sahib.

107
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,837
Hear him talk!

108
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:42,846

Don't shoot!

How can l let it go?

113
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,623
l am his brother-in-law.

114
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,751
When will Uday Pratap Singh
fire his riffle if not today?

115
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,829
Someone will get hurt.

116
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,490
How can someone get hurt?
l won't be shooting like this.

117
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,699
Keep the barrel up!

118
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,633
Grandpa,
l meant, l will shoot like this.

119
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,004

Pick him up!

See, you got hurt.

124
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,480
lt's because of such gimmicks
that your height didn't grow.

125
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,617
Stop scolding me and
get me some turmeric milk.

l'll go and get it.

127

Mann sahib, where's Kala?

00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,656
You are concerned about

00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,287
''The one who doesn't walk

''That's what makes the heart beat.''

148
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,862
''He likes fire, don't fear the sun.''

149
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,524
''That's why there's a fire in him.''

150
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,932

''You can see pure energy
visible on his face.''

00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,907
''That's why he can
be mistaken for fire.''

''There is no fight without a cause.''

Ask him to hook us up with foreigners.

170
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,682
Hello! You are my brother-in-law.

00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,729
But atleast give me some respect.

178
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,672
Hello! What's wrong with her?
She's just a little on the heavy side.

179
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,732
No one will have a sister like ours.

180
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,369
l too have four sisters.

181
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,913
l didn't need a sister,
l needed a wife.

182
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,812
Whose wife should l get for you?

183
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,407
Anyone's will do, brother.

184
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,986
Hello! Roop's calling you.

185
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,346
Let's go.
- Alone.

186
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,717
Alone? l won't go alone. No.

187
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,657
He wants to meet him alone.

188
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,859
Okay! Him!

189
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:28,627
This means agreat personality
like Uday Pratap Singh will sit alone?

190
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,498
What Uday Pratap Singh?

191
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,833
Your name is taller than your height.

192
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,262
People ride cycle
with training wheels.

193
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,705
He rides a scooter
with training wheels.

194
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,443
l will shoot you, Mann sahib!

195
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,911
You can either call
me sahib or shoot me!

196
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,414
Let's go.
- l will call you sahib.

197
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:49,681
Do what everyou can!
Sahib! Sahib! Sahib!

198
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,756
Couldn't you have said
this before the engagement?

199
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,920
l couldn't find out.
l searched everywhere.

200
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,628
Then you should've spoken about it.

201
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,529
l got scared of grandpa.

202
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,358
And as ifl am not scared ofhim.

203
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,697
lt's not like he is my cousin.

204
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,666
You didn't tell me
that he's your cousin.

205
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,866
Shut up, Mann.

206
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,805
You never add sahib to my name.

207
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,812
Can't you insult him instead of me?

208
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,005
He's the one who loves a foreigner.

209
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,681
Don't you know that he doesn't
let a foreigner stay in the village?

210
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,481
And you want to marry a
foreigner that too with a ring.

211
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,288
See! lt must be her!

212
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,415
She keeps calling meever
since found out about the engagement.

213
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,549
Let me talk to her.

214
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,524
Hello?

215
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,696
Julia, all the lines to
this route just got engaged.

216
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,693
Please, brother-in-law.
Don't say that.

217
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,628
Punjabi?

218
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,562
Has she done masters in Gurmukhi?

219
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,534
l taught her.

220
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,934
l was sent to teach Punjabi
to foreigners, so l taught it.

221
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,270
Oh! Okay.

222
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,901
Julia, l repeat.
You cannot get married to him.

223
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,906
Don't say that. Help us.

224
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,711
Please, reason with the old man.

225
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,580
Old man?
You taught her Bhatinda Punjabi?

226
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,985
Couldn't you have taught
her to say 'dada'(grandpa)?

227
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,656
She couldn't pronounce it well.
Old man was easier to her to learn.

228
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,456
Your grandpa is tough,
l too can never learn him.

229
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,586
Just a minute.

230
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,393
Julia, please heed my advice.
Find someone else for yourself.

231
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,625
You should have spoken about me.

232
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,530
Mann sahib.
She is his future sister-in-law.

233
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,804
Please excuse me, brother.

234
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,399
Fine, Kala.

235
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,306
You forgot when the roof fell down
and you were just three years old?

236
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,904
l risked my life and saved yours.

237
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,504
And now it's your turn.

238
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,845
Don't get too emotional.
You act like Sahiba.

239
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,317
She got her lover killed.
He will get his brother killed.

240
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,650
Right, Mann sahib?
- Sahib?

241
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,883
You address me as sahib
only if you seek a favour.

242
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,788
Tell me,what do you want me to do?

243
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:34,756
Nothing much.

244
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,657
Just make sure there are no bullets
in grandpa's gun in the morning.

245
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,928
Read it.

246
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:46,261
This is the letter my brother has
written to his future sister-in-law.

247
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,497
So now l will read it.

248
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,033
No matter how busy you are,
do read it.

249
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,745
No matter how busy you are,
do read it.

250
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,906
Stop all your work and read it.

251
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,510
Look at this!

252
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,719
Kato? Why is this world our enemy?

253
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,417
You love me and you are
about to marry my elder brother.

254
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:09,785
Okay!

255
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,931
Kato? Why should we consider
this to be the final decision?

256
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,595
l wanted you to make you
my wife and not my sister-in-law.

257
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,668
Wonderful, Kali.

258
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,673
Your emotions are so well written.

259
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,403
Shut up.

260
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,905
Kato? Why..

261
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,253
Why did l have to go through this?

262
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,681
We were to exchanges
vows with each other.

263
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,853
They would sing about
you and l would've danced.

264
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,657
l would dance.

265
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,630
Would. Okay. So now it's would.

266
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,427
Listen..

267
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,298
You were dancing when
he was getting betrothed.

268
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,372
Then you didn't know
he is going to get married?

269
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,376
l was under delusion back then.

270
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,502
Continue reading.

271
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,876
Kato? Why..

272
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,010
l cannot even sing this
song for my brother's wedding.

273
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,687
''My brother is getting married!''

274
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,916
''Wonderful. Wonderful!''

275
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,754
''My brother is getting married!''

276
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,392
Continue reading.

277
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,558
Kato? Why are we giving up?

278
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,466
As soon as you get this get this letter
gather some money and jewellery..

279
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,265
..and meet meat the
higher sector of the village.

280
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:32,037
Other wise l will have Rs.
5.50's rat poison and die.

281
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,404
You shouldn't listen to anyone.

282
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:40,314
lf anyone asks you why and
with whom are you running away Kale?

283
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,786
Why? Why, Kato?

284
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:45,819
Kato?

285
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:46,856
Kato?

286
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,384
No, father.

287
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:53,591
l swear,this letter is alie.

288
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,291
Kato is scared, grandpa..

289
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,668
You look more scared than her.

290
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,707
Some one whose love refuses
to admit is bound to be scared.

291
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,709
Right.

292
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,573
Kato? - No, father.
l am telling the truth.

293
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:16,416
Uday Pratap Singh suggests that
since their names start with 'K'..

294
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,921
And she will be joining
the same family..

295
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:22,517
You should marry her
with Kale instead of Roop.

296
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,652
Right.

297
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,787
What's right?

298
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,388
You sow somewhere and reap else where?

299
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,864
l fixed her marriage with Roop.

300
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,766
l will lose my honour if
she doesn't get married to Roop.

301
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,997
He  is right as well.

302
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,297
Just a minute.

303
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:40,970
Uncle, my brother-in-law..
you are my brother-in-law.

304
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,014
lf he doesn't die
consuming the rat poison..

305
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:50,016
..and you get her married to Roop,
then how will they face each other?

306
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,290
You should understanding
the under lying tension.

307
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,358
Right.

308
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,384
Why don't you say something?

309
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,722
What should l say?

310
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,764
No one considers mean elder here.

311
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,697
Father, let's sit and discuss this.

312
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,427
lts the same family.

313
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,631
We don't want her to marry the family.

314
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,903
Roop was educated in Canada.

315
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,844
And he flunked in the 10th grade.

316
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,943
Who said he flunked in the 10th grade?

317
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,879
We both were expelled from
the school in the 8th grade.

318
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,811
His daughter isn't a PhD either.

319
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,546
l can at least know English.

320
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,588
Conclusion is,
look at the family. - Right.

321
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,819
Which family? Take your family home.

322
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,895
Grandpa,
they are insulting our family.

323
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,827
l sacrifice my love for my family.

324
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,264
l refuse to marry her.
- Shutup.

325
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,630
Take him home.

326
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,998
We'll get our daughter
married to a Canada returned boy.

327
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,608
And not your uneducated son.

328
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:49,942
Okay, then l too pledge that l shall
get my brother married to a foreigner.

329
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,879
Oh yes!
- Shutup.

330
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,880
Aspur of the moment thing.

331
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,954
Kale..

332
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,899
Don't be upset, grandpa.

333
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,602
So what if our relatives
aren't supporting us?

334
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,865
l am here. Kala. Your grandson.

335
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,306
l will find a girl for Roop.

336
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,772
Have you lost your mind?

337
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,277
Foreigner? You want me dead?

338
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,445
You aren't worried of the
fact that your grandson..

339
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,816
..declared something
and now we need to fulfil it?

340
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,913
Your declaration? You are no Rajput!

341
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,422
You gave your word!

342
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,531
l didn't like the Rajput taunt.

343
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,029
Why the enmity?

344
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,976
You insulted me and l forgot about it.

345
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,970
Look over there.

346
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,318
Tell me, why are those kids fighting?

347
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,547
They are fighting for no reason.

348
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,347
No.

349
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,689
Their great grandfathers were enemies.

350
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,260
Then their grandfathers were.

351
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,761
Then their fathers took over.

352
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:16,790
And now they are continuing it.

353
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:19,963
Boys!

354
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,736
Come here.

355
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:27,745
Yes, grandpa?

356
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,270
Why were you fighting?

357
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:36,014
My blood boils when l see him.

358
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,749
Saw?

359
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,253
They don't even know what
the reason for the enmityis.

360
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,264
Yet their blood boils.

361
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,764
Because the enmity lies in the blood.

362
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,940
Your blood boils!
You area great enemy!

363
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,446
You cannot even wipe your own nose!

364
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,379
Don't, Kala.
- Kala?

365
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,611
Okay, uncle. Please forgive me.

366
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,653
Get lost!

367
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,784
Kala! Kala! Kala!

368
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,427
Thats all the respect l get?

369
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:28,597
''On the eve of the wedding
l shall meet you at dawn.''

370
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,607
''All dressed up..''

371
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,971
Stop it.

372
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,009
My brother,
you have just three options left.

373
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,682
First: Forget her.

374
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,611
Second: Forget her.

375
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,484
And third:
- l cannot. l love her.

376
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,850
Look, now my lifeis in your hands.

377
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,258
My hands are empty.
l hold no strings.

378
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,361
You forgot when you
were 1 and half years old..

379
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,330
You talk of the times when..
- Let me finish.

380
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,903
Uncle Bishan was reversing the trolley..

381
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,406
..if l wouldn't have saved you
then you would've come under it.

382
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,304
Oh really?

383
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,001
You are the Saktimann.

384
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,842
l don't even know whether
heis telling the truth.

385
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,313
He always makes me emotional.

386
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,508
What should l do?

387
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,813
Grandpa doesn't want
a foreign daughter-in-law.

388
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,445
He wants revenge from them.

389
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,489
Can you help him get revenge?

390
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:27,963
Revenge!

391
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,308
Najjar Singh,
what ever that happened was not right.

392
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,674
Your name is getting ruined.

393
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,904
Najjar Singh's grandson
was rejected by a girl.

394
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,448
This is a limit.

395
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,514
Uncle!

396
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,479
Aunt is saying tell uncle
not to give unsolicited advice.

397
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,715
He should handle his own family.

398
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,383
The buffalo isn't giving
milk and the girl isn't studying.

399
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,791
She said he if he doesn't come soon
then she will break your legs.

400
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,762
Fine. l am going, Kale.
l'll see you later.

401
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,293
Let's go.

402
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,589
Let's go, man.

403
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,326
Grandpa..

404
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,902
l need to give water to the cattle.

405
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,938
Grandpa, you might be
right and l might be wrong.

406
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,940
Last night l got thinking,
ifa kid's blood can boil..

407
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,511
..then no ice runs
in my vein either.

408
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,978
My blood can boil too!

409
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,244
Now l have decided
that we will seek revenge.

410
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:26,489
l will break their heads
if they come in front ofme.

411
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,481
Right, grandpa?

412
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,489
But the problem is how
they will come before me.

413
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,530
l found a solution to that as well.

414
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:37,830
lt'll keep you seek revenge
and my pledge will also get fulfilled.

415
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,605
Don't hit me.
Let me finish.

416
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,671
Just assume that rate
for aton is 100.

417
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,037
What nonsense!

418
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:49,973
Okay then assume that we
get Roop married to a foreigner.

419
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,814
She can be from Canada,
a daughter of an Englishman.

420
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,785
She'll get married and come here.

421
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,322
We will give aholiday
to all the servants.

422
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,951
My grandpa will order
and make her work like a slave.

423
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,758
When she will have to cook
13 flatbreads for a single person..

424
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,355
Sure. Of course..

425
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,499
You cannot feed me and
that foreigner will feed me?

426
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,963
So assume that l cannot hit
you because my stick is not here.

427
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,405
l'll hit you so hard on your
bottoms that they will turn red.

428
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,440
Get lost!

429
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,506
Think over it.
There is no other option.

430
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,480
l cannot go to their village.
- Are you leaving or should l..

431
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,541
''l cannot go to their village.''

432
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,549
To their village?

433
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:51,499
Grandpa, are you thinking
about what l want you to think?

434
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,334
There is no harm in thinking.

435
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,005
Think. Let's think
about something else today.

436
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:02,278
Think. You are thinking
about how to seek revenge, right?

437
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,851
You still have to think in
the same thing, just change the way.

438
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,286
The same relationship
but with a new thought.

439
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,919
Think carefully.

440
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,762
My grandpa is sitting on a cot.

441
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,299
A foreigner has her faced
veiled and getting your lunch.

442
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,892
Look, grandpa, there she comes.

443
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,030
Back off.

444
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,898
Grandpa, look,there she comes.

445
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:29,470
She has her faced veiled
and has your lunch in her hands.

446
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,746
She is walking towards you.

447
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:53,838
You notice that the
food has gone cold.

448
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,829
You throw the plate away.

449
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,370
And she is gathering the spilled okra.

450
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,254
Then she gets hot food for you.

451
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,732
Look, she will collect dung for us.

452
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:30,469
Not just you, our cattle
will also seek revenge from her.

453
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:37,281
Think, she is running
here and there and working.

454
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:42,376
Sheis tired and you
are pleased to seeher.

455
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,419
Please forgive me, grandpa.

456
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,955
My fore fathers made a mistake.

457
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,995
My grandpa was a scoundrel.

458
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:05,465
Please forgive me.

459
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:10,512
Grandpa..

460
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:11,747
Grandpa!

461
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,315
l don't like what you are saying.

462
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,685
But its good.

463
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,453
Then think about the good.
We will start liking it later.

464
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:27,295
Tell me, something.
Will she gather the dung?

465
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,458
Just gather the dung,
we will make her handle everything.

466
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:34,972
No. Punjabis don't
seek revenge from women.

467
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,337
lt will be nice if we can
seek revenge from her father.

468
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,501
Her father?
- Yes.

469
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,976
Look,there's her father.

470
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,277
No, you idiot! There's her father!

471
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,315
l meant her father
won't be spared.

472
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,485
We will get him to get
his hands dirty too.

473
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,311
With God's grace,
we have a lot to take care of.

474
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:54,015
l want to see an Englishman
stand before me with his hands folded.

475
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,256
But how can he work
with his hands folded?

476
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,863
No, stupid.

477
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,368
l want her father to bring his
daughter's marriage proposal to me.

478
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,762
When he will apologise
To me before the villagers..

479
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,700
l will beat peace.

480
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,406
Here you go, uncle. Pick this one.

481
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,349
Yes? - Kale!

482
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,015
Kale!- Yes?

483
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,913
What are you doing over here?
What happened?

484
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,315
Uncle has found a sister-in-law.

485
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,859
Not a sister-in-law.
l am talking about grandpa.

486
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,258
Grandpa agreed.
Leave.- What? Grandpa agreed!

487
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,764
Love you! Love you!
Love you, brother! Love you!

488
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:39,633
Go and call your father-in-law.
- Yes. Yes.

489
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,604
How much..

490
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,613
l do hope our trip is successful.

491
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:59,247
'Mr. Albert is very happy to go to lndia today.
Where his forefathers ruled for 100 years.'

492
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,491
'He still thinks thatlndia is filled
with poor people.' - Dad! They are not poor.

493
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,495
Anyway.. Soon his misunderstanding
shall be cleared.- Have respect.

494
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:09,932
Call Roop's grandfather 'Budda' (old man).
- 'And she is his daughter,Julia.'

495
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,865
l am sure he will like it.

496
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,938
She's teaching him to address
Roop's grandfather as Budda, in lndia.

497
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,907
Now where the heck is Alisha?

498
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,730
Hi.- Hi, auntie.
- Hi, uncle. l'm sorry.

499
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,601
Hello, hello.
Think over it again, dear.

500
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,470
Please don't go to Punjab.
- Mom, please.

501
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,670
l am going only for
4 days with Julia's father.

502
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,441
So that he doesn't face
a language problem there.

503
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,572
Okay? You know that.

504
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,481
That's fine. But you don't
know about the boys in Punjab.

505
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,521
They go crazy over a Canadian
girl and a bullet motorcycle.

506
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,590
Please don't go there
and settle down with someone.

507
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,955
Mom! Mind your language.

508
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,985
As ifthey can understand any of this.

509
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:16,331
Look, you better swear by the
facing your hands to the Gurudwara..

510
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,527
That you will return
as you areleaving.

511
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:19,625
Where should l face my hands?

512
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,271
l am not a child, mom.

513
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,907
Bye.

514
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,872
l love you.
- l love you too.

515
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:25,874
Okay.

516
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,442
Listen..
watch out for the rustics.

517
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,244
And keep messaging meon Voice-book.

518
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,612
You mean Facebook?

519
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,446
Right, Facebook.

520
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:36,976
Bye.

521
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,255
Let's go, Alisha.

522
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,347
l am dying to see poor people.
- Dad!

523
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,948
l am sorry. The'Budda' of Roop.

524
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,519
Uncle.

See you soon.

527
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,296
Bye.

528
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,923
Villagers..

529
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:56,296
The moment we have
been waiting for has come.

530
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:01,511
Tomorrow an Englishman
will come here.

531
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,375
And we will hit him.

532
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:04,776
Yes!
- Yes!

533
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,476
l am tired of hitting the cattle.

534
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,450
Now its time to hit the real one.

535
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,748
No, son.

536
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,981
One shouldn't hurt his guest.

537
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,914
Now that he is your grandson's
father-in-law, you are being lenient.

538
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:15,993
Shut up.

539
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,727
l am being lenient as he
is my grandson's father-in-law

540
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,553
lts not so.

541
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:23,765
l agreed to this alliance to
that we can seek revenge from them.

542
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:29,904
But its decided that we will make
apologise in front of all villager.

543
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:30,667
Right.

544
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,936
Uncle, you want everyone
in the world to apologise.

545
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,274
Your daughter keeps
your bed on the streets.

546
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,540
You never made her apologise.

547
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,375
Shut up.

548
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,483
Mind your manners with your seniors.

549
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:41,546
Okay.

550
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,676
He is absolutely right.

551
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,558
Tomorrow as soon as
he steps his foot here..

552
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:53,290

apologise to all of you.

555
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,472
Where is he?

556
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:18,388
Look, they are so soft and fair.

557
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,022
And our girls are rough and bitter.

558
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,291
We need to see the stole
to find outifits a girl or a boy.

559
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,820
True.

560
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,555

00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,001
Try this trick on someone else.

565
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,737
l didn't buy this checked
handkerchief from the fair.

566
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,575
lt had fallen down.
l thought it might be yours.

567
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,515
Anyway, l liked your honesty.

568
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,448
No one lets go of
anything that's free.

569
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:22,849
Thank you for your appreciation.

570

00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,988
Oh my God. My mom was right.

574
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,459
They start hovering overthe girl as
soon as they know she is a foreigner.

575
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,866
Hello, madam.
l spoke to you becausel liked you.

576
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,463
You can show your foreign
returned attitude to someone else.

..after getting everyone's consent.

605

But everyone didn't
give their consent.

He's the one who made us late.

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,777
On the basis of seniority, he has to.

the villagers all the time.

702

So you have to say it.

'What will he do now?'

720

And, and you, and you, and you..

735
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,949
'You developed because of us.'

736
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,687
Whatare you saying!

737
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,992
Hesays, that he is sad
that he has just one daughter.

738
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,699
lf he had three,then he
would've married them with you,..

739
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,633
..and Pali, you and Jeeta, you.

He also says that you
guys are generous and kind.

746
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,795
The one who forgives is the greatest.

747
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,666
Mann sahib, handle the situation.

748
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,434
Fine. ln the evening then.

00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:56,325
And he says that he is happy to get
his daughter married into our family.

754
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,988
lt's very difficult to find
an alliance of a prosperous family.

755
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,561
Okay. Okay. Okay.

756
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,031
Now, let's celebrate.

757
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,836
Come, let's dance.

758
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,830
That was great!

759
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,326
Oh, my God.

760
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,463
You are here.
You have come to my room?

761
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,863
Look, don't misunderstand me.
l am here to apologise.

762
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,597
l am not a bad person.

763
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,433
No one can be worse than you, okay?

764
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,000
Forgetabout what you
did to me at the airport.

765
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,910
What are you doing to uncle?

766
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,945
He was going to get beaten with shoes.

767
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,515
l am doing all this so
that Roop can get married.

768
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:53,876
l don't know what happens there..

769
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,781
But here love is worshiped.

770
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,444
And those who love are the priests.

771
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:00,818
l am doing all this
to unite those two priests.

772
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,784
Look, nothing is greater than love.

773
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,756
Every one in this world should love.

774
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,556
Caste, colour,
creed, class, Canada, Punjab..

775
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,768
Well educated girl,
less educated boy..

776
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,271
Such differences shouldn't matter.

777
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,638
Why did you say the last
line pointing your fingers at us?

778
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,968
l must have made a mistake.

779
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,908
Well educated boy,
less educated girl..

780
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,417
You are just too much.

781
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,888
Look, l have a pure heart.

782
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,526
l face my hands towards
Gurudwara and say that.

783
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,325
Fine.

784
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,396
l forgive you.

785
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,504
You just don't have a pure heart,
you are cute as well.

786
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,569
Good night.

787
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:54,501
Bye.

788
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:01,581
Kale!

789
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,715
Kale!

790
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:05,584
Yes?

791
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:11,790
So?

792
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,860
l think she loves me.

793
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:16,899
Forgetit.

794
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,433
Where you stand and where she..

795
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,599
l mean where you stand
and where she stands.

796
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:21,762
Hear him talk.

797
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,331
You know she touched my
hair and said that l am cute.

798
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,032
No way!

799
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,475
You swear?

800
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,972
l swear on God, l never lie.

801
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,380
Then Mr. Dilip Kumar,
you need to give me a party.

802
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,548
Seven shots each of
homebrewed liquor? - Fine.

803
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:41,780
By the way what did she like in me?

804
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,289
That's something to think about.

805
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,290
Either she thinks l am handsome.

806
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,358
Or she liked the things l said.

807
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:52,662
Handsome? Am l not handsome?

808
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,801
And the things you said?
You are not Abdul Kalam.

809
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,573
She must've liked your teeth.

810
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,438
Yes,that's possible.

811
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,278
Listen, she will be
leaving in a few days.

812
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:07,577
Before you start banging your head on
the walls and listen to Mr. Akram Rahi songs..

813
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,651
..you better settle things with her.

814
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,688
Wait for morning.
See what special treatment l get.

815
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,252
You are going to get
unwell in the morning?

816
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,554
Please think about something
else too sometimes.

817
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:21,420
By special treatment l mean
see how well she takes care of me.

818
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,562
Okay.

819
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:26,833
Now let's just wait for morning.

820
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,002
By the way, don't you think
nights are a bit longer these days?

821
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,636
Get lost. Let me sleep.

822
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,828
Come back..

823
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,830
Can't help it.
l couldn't sleep last night.- Hi.

824
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,764
Really?

825
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,796
Hold this.

826
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,713

827
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,507
Yes?

828
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,317
Take uncle outside.

829
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:21,689
Please.

830
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:23,453
Okay?

831
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,993
Kala!

832
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,924
By the way,
we would've handled it at home.

833
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,891
Grandpa said no.

834
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,935
Grandpa sometimes scolds
for odd things.

835
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,335
How long does he take?

836
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:35,994
What?.

837
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,265
Forgetit. Call uncle.

838
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,674
Kale.. What kind of
a special treatment is this?

839
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,406
l am the one helping her.
- Okay?

840
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:47,744
Who else will she tell?

841
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,249
Uncle.

842
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,551
Hello, uncle.
l seek your blessings. - Yeah. Yeah.

843
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,749
Let's go.

844

Bye.
- Thank you. Thanks.

845
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,694
l wonder when l will
get a special treatment.

846
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,703
Go there and download.

847
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:09,863
Okay.

Get lost.

853
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,879
Albert! Stop! l will kill you!

854
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,992
Oh brother, even going
to the toilet is dangerous here.

855
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,261
l will kill you! Albert!

856
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,852
No, no, no.

857
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,955
Don't worry. They are not after you.

858
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,761
After the cattle.
- Cattle?

859

Yes, cattle.
- Albert! l will kill you! Get lost!

860
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,473
Albert, l will kill you!
- Hitting them, not you.

861
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,700
Yeah. Animal. Animal.
- l can't do this anymore.

862
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,300
Let's finalise the marriage
and get me out of here.

863
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:49,777
Okay, okay..

864
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,004
Let's go there.

865
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,281
Okay.

866
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,484
Field. There now..
l'll take you there.

867
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,010
Look, my brother is looking
so handsome. - Yes.

868
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,288
The amount ofsweets

00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,357
..you can start your own shop with it.

870
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,891
Mann sahib..

He had got engaged earlier as well.

They hadn't given less sugar crystals.

876
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,798
Let's see how long
this relationship lasts.

877
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,568
Keep quiet.

00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,653
Heis here.
You will be leaving in two days.

881
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:34,553
Congratulations.

882
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,489
Congratulations, uncle.

883
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,620
How can you congratulate
just like that?

884
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,629
On this joyous occasion..

885
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:44,895
lf Uday Pratap Singh does anything
then l shall behis worst enemy.

886
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,695
No. What will l do?

887
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,601
Uncle just gave me a signal.

888
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,298
l say that now that
everyone is here,..

889
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,501
..let's decide where
will the wedding take place.

890
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,604
Where? - Yes.

891
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,742
We will be going to her house,
right, Kale?

892
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:06,013
lt's not like they stay around
the corner that we will go there.

893
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,788
She stays in Canada.
How will all the guests go there?

894
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,584
We will go there.

895
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,861
Let the world know that Mr.
Najjar Singh took his..

896
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,957
..grandson's wedding procession
to an Englishman's house.

897
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,270
They made us serve them for 100 years.

898
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,774
We will make them serve
us for at least a week.

899
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:26,774
Right, Kale?

900
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:30,870
A week? l say we should
stay there for 2-3 months.

901
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,350
We will seek revenge!
- Yes, yes, yes.

902
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,422
His blood is boiling. Now hewill
return only after seeking revenge.

903
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,650
Simon Commission go back!

904
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,625
Simon Commission comeback!

905
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,991
Hey!
- Mann sahib. Keep quiet.

906
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:49,589
Simon commission! Right!

907
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:55,338
Dear, tell him what l have decided.

908
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,563
Okay.

909
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:00,733
Uncle,they are saying that they'll
all come to Canada for the marriage.

910
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,775
Consider it done. No problem.

911
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,313
How many are we talking?

912
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,812
He's okay with it. But how many
people will be attending the wedding?

913
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,855
Around 1000, l think.

914
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,325
Why just 1000? Why not take
the whole of Bangladesh with us?

915
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:18,951
Shut up.

916
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,527
l mean, you are smart.
You can take how many you please.

917
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:28,463
People whose weddings we have attend
will want to attend his wedding, right, son?

918
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,698
ltis obvious.

919
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,501
But so many people?

920
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,634
l've heard one isn't born until
one visits Canada.

921
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:38,009
Hear that! You are not born yet?
Your age suggests otherwise.

922
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,473
Do you havea passport?

923
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,811
l havea ration card.

924
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,545
Do you want to buy sugar
in Canada with the ration card?

925
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,678
Only those who have a passport can go.

926
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,654
lt is not that easy, son.

927
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,922
One also needs to
get a visa to go there.

928
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:54,556
Uncle knows quite a few people.
That can be arranged.

929
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:58,799
Fine,then. Get the passports
and make preparations.

930
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,336
Yes.- Okay, so it's decided.

931
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:04,703
Now no one can stop Uday Pratap Singh.

932
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,504
Why do you get scared?
This is nothing.

933
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:22,882
Oh no.

934
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,797
Where to?
- To the city. For shopping.

935
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:31,760
Shopping?
- Yeah.

936
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,766
You had work, right?
- Me? No.

937
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,830
ln the morning when l
told grandpa about Julia you..

938
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,970
Leave.

939
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,412
Sorry, Alisha. Can't go.

940
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:47,339
Take her.
- Yes, no problem. l'll go with her.

941
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,917
lt's okay. We can go tomorrow.

942
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:49,485
Tomorrow?

943
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:50,518
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

944
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,712
One shouldn't buy
clothes on Wednesdays.

945
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,345
Trunks can catch fire.

946
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,716
Look in front.

947
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,760
Then you will have
to sit on the bonnet.

948
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,525
lt's very nice, ma'am.
Look at this.

949
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,830
Give me another one.

950
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:09,837
l wanted to talk to you.

951
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,441
Look at this red one.
lt will look great on fair skin.

952
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,033
Wow,this is so beautiful.

953
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:18,246
Look at this work. - What do you say,
Kale? lsn't it beautiful?

954
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:21,749
Very beautiful. Pack it.
- No, show something else.

955
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,011
Sure. This yellow one.

956
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,450
Do you want to sell
everything in the shop today?

957
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,316
Can't you keep quiet for some time?
- Strange.

958
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,721
l want to talk to you.

959
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:34,821
l want to say that l
know that girls can't say it.

960
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,023
The boy needs to say it.

961
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,327
Hence, l will say it that l..

962
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:44,903
l love you.

963
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,734
What?.

964
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:49,272
What did you say?

965
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,408
You seem very shocked.
ls she your aunt?

966
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,310
What made you think that, Kala?

967
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:53,882
You are from Kullu Manali?

968
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,975
Look, you should express such things.

969
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,777
Otherwise things can get worse later.

970
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:02,889
You know Madhi? The mill owner's son?

971
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,791
He was in love with Bholi.

972
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,487
But he couldn't say it.
And Bholi got married.

973
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,459
And now he is into drugs.
And l hate drugs.

974
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:18,897
Hence instead of doing
drugs l think saying it better.

975
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,967
But what made you
think that l love you?

976
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:29,682
l just look naove. l realised
it when you touched my hair.

977
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,777
Right then..

978
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,621
l touched your hair
and it means l love you?

979
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,292
Strange.

980
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,728
lf l touch his hair,
does it mean that l love him?

981
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,897
What should l make of this?

982
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:46,867
No.

983
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,961
All the crazy people
have gathered here or what?

984
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,536
Mom was right.
Rustic boys of this place..

985
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,672
She is shy.
- Of you or me?

986
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,339
From your uncle.

987
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:01,848
Strange.

988
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:33,880
''l am sure this is
the effect of your love.''

989
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:39,979
''l can't sleep at night.''

990
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:45,995
''l am sure this is
the effect of your love.''

991
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:51,432
''l can't sleep at night.''

992
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:57,704
''l see a beautiful face everywhere.''

993
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:03,638
''My heart is always restless.''

994
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:09,912
''l am sure this is
the effect of your love.''

995
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:16,652
''l can't sleep at night.''

996
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:32,773
Madam..

997
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:38,438
Please forgive me if l've said
anything untoward unintentionally.

998
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:40,981
lt's okay.

999
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,551
''My beloved is dark,
make the fairones go away.''

1000
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:49,688
Kale..

1001
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,760
Why is your name Kala?

1002
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:53,853
Forget it.

1003
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,696
lfl tell you the reason, you
will say that l am praising myself.

1004
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,026
When l was born,
l was very handsome.

1005
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,326
Very handsome.

1006
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,307
Nurse was not ready to
hand me over to my mother.

1007
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,033
She said l belong to her.
My mother got worried.

1008
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,343
She thought someone
will cast an evil eyeon me.

1009
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,810
So, she named me Kala Singh.

1010
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,345
But still someone did
cast an evil eyeon me.

1011
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:19,953
That's why nothing worked out for me.

1012
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,684
Don't say that. Believe in yourself.

1013
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,990
No, l have full confidence in myself.

1014
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,562
l can do anything.Anything.

1015
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:34,562
lf you say,
l can even bring the moon down.

1016
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:36,938
Do it.

1017
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,710
Here it is.

1018
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:46,512
Good.

1019
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,875
Very good.

1020
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,946
But, l don't need it.

1021
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:55,754
Oh really?
- Hmm.

1022
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,826
Then l'll send it back.

1023
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,693
How?

1024
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,739
What are you doing?

1025
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,355
You are very cute.

1026
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:33,889
''lt's all l can say,
l wanna be with you tonight.''

1027
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:39,799
''lt's you l wanna be with, it is you.''

1028
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:46,600
''These winds are now my friend.''

1029
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:51,874
''Ever since it started drizzling.''

1030
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:58,610
''Even the moon starting
emitting light..''

1031
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:04,455
''l had a meeting with stars.''

1032
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:10,566
''Now l don't feel hungry or cold.''

1033
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:16,435
''Darkness doesn't scare me anymore.''

1034
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:21,977
''l am sure this is
the effect of your love.''

1035
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:28,412
''l can't sleep at night.''

1036
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:34,354
''l am sure this is
the effect of your love.''

1037
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:40,459
''l can't sleep at night.''

1038
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:45,865
''l can't sleep at night.''

1039
01:01:58,781 --> 01:01:59,941
You look sad.

1040
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:01,781
What do l say?.

1041
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,818
l won't like anything without her.

1042
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:04,945
Should we stop her?

1043
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,549
Did you talk to her?

1044
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:13,351
l didn't talk to her,
but she hugged me last night.

1045
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,262
You swear?

1046
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:17,755
l swear on God.

1047
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,333
And one more thing,
l never lie.

1048
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:28,308
Dilip Kumar,
l don't like this.

1049
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,603
Yes, mom.
- Shutup.

1050
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,616
Let's see where it falls then.

1051
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,885
Yes. l am coming back.

1052
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:38,711
ls everything alright?

1053
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,487

Okay. Okay. Mom! Okay, bye.

1058
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,470
What happened?

1059
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,968
l just remembered about the moon.

1060
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:05,446
What about the moon?

1061
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:11,819
Last night when l made
the moon go back up, you..

1062
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:15,322
Please. How can l dare to hug you?

1063
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:16,884
lt never happened, okay?

1064
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:19,420
But..

1065
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,892
lt's okay, brother Kale.

1066
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:27,796
This is the way the world works.

1067
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:32,272
But l still don't think
she touched your hair.

1068
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:34,441
Let's go, son.

1069
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:36,572
Yes, grandpa.

1070
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:37,441
Come on. Get in.

1071
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:42,408
You too want to go?

1072
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,286
No, l have an important meeting.

1073
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,256
Feed the cattle. Meeting, right!

1074
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,887
He has a meeting.
- Okay.

1075
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,661
Look,we'll get to the airport..

1076
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,857
Uncle. Hello. l seek your blessing.

1077
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,298
Wow! God! Keep him away from me!

1078
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,927
Take care, uncle.

1079
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:19,820
So, this is the land where
l will build Roop's house.

1080
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:23,983
Both of them will stay
after marriage. Okay?

1081
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,853
What exactly is he saying,Alisha?

1082
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:32,629
Uncle, grandpa just said that
after the marriage of Roop and Julia..

1083
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:36,364
He's going to build a house
here for them to live. - Here?

1084
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:37,734
ls he insane?

1085
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,504
My daughter and son-in-law are not
going to live in bloody sixteen century.

1086
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:46,311
They live in Canada or
this marriage is cancelled.

1087
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,920
What's wrong with all of you?

1088
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:53,744
What is he saying?

1089
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,948
lf you make a lot of fuss, forget about
the wedding, l'll break your head.

1090
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,584
What is he blabbering about?

1091
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:05,331
He.. He's saying..
- Just a minute. l'll tell him.

1092
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,662
Grandpa, you are getting
angry for no reason.

1093
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,796
He says, you shouldn't
build a house over here.

1094
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,876
He says stay in the mansion.
They should stay in the mansion.

1095
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:14,567
Okay.

1096
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:18,738
He says if Roop and Julia don't look
after you then he will beat them up.

1097
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:20,577
He's a nice person.
- Very.

1098
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:21,012
That's very nice.

1099
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,841
My grandson and his wife
will stay with me in the mansion.

1100
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,512
Good. Good.
- What?

1101
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:26,417
Good. Good. Good. Good.

1102
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:27,511
He agreed.

1103
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:30,815
He said, both of them
can go there after marriage.

1104
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,860
Go there. Excellent.
- Yes.

1105
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,523
No,the mansion is this way.
- No, no, no.

1106
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,293
l said it is over there.
You come with me.

1107
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:42,565
Look, we can work this out.
We can build a house where the..

1108
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,299
Have you lost your mind?
- Why?.

1109
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,607
What have you done!

1110
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,032
Don't worry. l'll handle it.

1111
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:51,637
Excuse me. This is not like
sending the moon back in a bucket..

1112
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,648
You remember the moon..
- No!

1113
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,480
Let's talk about your lie.
- Let's talk about the moon..

1114
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:01,680
Let's talk about your lie.
- Let's talk about the moon..

1115
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,021
Get the car, Kale.
- Coming, grandpa.

1116
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,757
Look, nothing has happened.

1117
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:06,795
Nothing has happened?

1118
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,524
Do you know the consequences of this?

1119
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,561
What will happen when
your lie will be caught?

1120
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,002
l..
- Oh, just shut up! Shutup!

1121
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,637
She is acting as if
the Englishman won't agree.

1122
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,481
But what if he doesn't?

1123
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,580
Get the car, son.

1124
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:30,743
Yes. Coming.

1125
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,254
''The path my brother's
wedding procession..''

1126
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,417
Will the Englishman agree?

1127
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:40,427
No.

1128
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,258
''Those paths have become beautiful.''

1129
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:43,457
Stop it, ladies.

1130
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:44,999
lt's ready.
Can we make the dessert now?

1131
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,859
Stop these sad songs. Sing this one.

1132
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,768
''When my brother caught the flight..''

1133
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:53,636
''The traditions of
our village are different.''

1134
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:57,406
''He will seek revenge.''

1135
01:06:58,614 --> 01:06:59,482
Shut up, Mann.

1136
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,471
Or l will hit you.

1137
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,787
Will the Englishman agree?
- No.

1138
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,282
Then you leave,
l will come in 2-3 days.

1139
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:11,951
No, you come with us,

1140
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,727
Hello, nephew.

1141
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:15,923
Uncle!

1142
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,657
How are you, son?
- l am doomed.

1143
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,737
lt's okay. Don't lose courage.

1144
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:25,467
lf he can get a fair one
then you can get a dark one.

1145
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:28,543
You won't remain single
like your uncle. Don't worry.

1146
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:31,477
We will go to Canada
and look at the beauties.

1147
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,711
Hello. l seek your blessings.

1148

How are you, nephew.
So you are back.- Yes.

1149
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,683
Where have you been?
- Kolkata. To deliver mangoes.

1150
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,621
Then l thought, people would say..

1151
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,286
..where you picking mangoes
when it was time to seek revenge?

1152
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,722
Fine, keep your bags
and get in the car.

1153
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:49,662
Okay.

1154
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:50,789
Kala, where's your brother-in-law?

1155
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,767
lnside.- Go and get him.
We are getting late.

1156
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:54,825
Let's go.
- Hurry up.

1157
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:55,869
Come on, everyone.

1158
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:57,830
Uncle!

1159
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,341
Finally the brave one held the gun.

1160
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,537
So darling,
have you packed my things?

1161
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:04,738
l have kept turmeric in this bag.

1162
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,248
Please avoid firing your gun.

1163
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,408
Fine. Good.
You did the right thing.

1164
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:10,678
l can get milk over there.

1165
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:11,946
What do you want to make?

1166
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,423
Okaythen. Give me the
permission to leave for Canada.

1167
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,787
Why are you holding this?
You sharp shooter..

1168
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:19,884
You cannot take this with you.
- Why can't l?

1169
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:22,326
Uday Pratap Singh will
look unarmed without it.

1170
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:25,466
You aren't going to kill
pigeons with it anyways.

1171
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,836
You are insulting me on my face?

1172
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,000
You want to sit in
thecar or coming running?

1173
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,797
l meant you can insult
me behind my back.

1174
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,376
Hold this.
What will l do with it?

1175
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:37,845
Don't you think
you pamper him alot?

1176
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,812
You guys chose him for me.

1177
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:41,579
Okay.

1178
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:43,345
Khalsa belongs to the Lord.

1179
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,885
Victory belongs to Him.

1180
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:49,619
On behalf of the family,
l very strictly request everyone..

1181
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:52,785
That no one should
try to run away in Canada.

1182
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:57,298
lf any one tries to run away then
he'll have to take care of himself.

1183
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:00,527
We won't bring him back.
You can wander there all your life.

1184
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:03,797
l have noted down everyone's
names in the notebook.

1185
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,007
Your attendance will
be taken everyday.

1186
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:09,601
No one will try to run away.
- Okay.

1187
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,970
Now you think that
we will run away.

1188
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:16,513
No one cares about the family
and they are pampering strangers.

1189
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,484
You are right, son.

1190
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:22,382
Look, first the broke
the match l had made. - Yes.

1191
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,822
They got us humiliated.
- Yes.

1192
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,416
And now this is their new accusation.

1193
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:26,859
That we will run
away after going there.

1194
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:28,554
Let's do one thing.
Let's just not go there.

1195
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,892
Let's not go there. Come on.

1196
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,660
Who all are not going?

1197
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:35,860
No, Kale. We aren't saying
that we aren't going.

1198
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,701
How can we leave like this.
We will leave after l fire a bullet.

1199
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,468
Let me shoot. Nothing will happen.

1200
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,804
Here.
- Give it to me. Let me fire.

1201
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:44,004
lt's nothing. lt's nothing.

1202
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,647
Oh no.

1203
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:50,977
Oh no.

1204
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,379
Chipped it?

1205
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,515
Oh no.

1206
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,594
Oh for God's sake?

1207
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:07,033
Kale, today, because of you
l can seek revenge from the English.

1208
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,534
l am so proud of you.

1209
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,933
Everyone should have
a grandson like you.

1210
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,338
Come here.

1211
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,540
God bless you.

1212
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:18,880
Come on, let's go.

1213
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,437
Come on.

1214
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:22,950
Come on, let's go. Hurry up.

1215
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:36,991
''Punjabis always keep
their pride and honour intact.''

1216
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:43,795
''Punjabis always keep
their pride and honour intact.''

1217
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:48,775
''The get rid of any obstacle
that comes in their path.''

1218
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:53,780
''Punjabis always keep
their pride and honour intact.''

1219
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:59,787
''Punjabis always keep
their pride and honour intact.''

1220
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:15,965
Why are we standing like this?

1221
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,633
This is lndian Tradition

1222
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,402
'We have to wait out
here until they arrive.'

1223
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:24,343
'As we are from the girl's side'

1224
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,980
''First we used to
say sorry and thank you.''

1225
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,947
''We used to drink from the same well.''

1226
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,886
''Now we will show them.''

1227
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,957
''We will taunt them.''

1228
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,583
''Now we will show them.''

1229
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,627
''We will taunt them.''

1230
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:43,323
''We will make their daughter
our daughter-in-law.''

1231
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:17,998
''They made many rules
and regulations.''

1232
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:21,662
''They fooled a naive lndia.''

1233
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:26,634
Hello, grandpa.

1234
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,903
Hello, dear. God bless you.

1235
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,275
Hello, everyone. How are you?

1236
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,404
Fine.

1237
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:35,881
Okay,first we'll have the introduction
ceremony in Punjabi style.

1238
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:39,442
''We'll put the English speaking
people back to kindergarten.''

1239
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:43,286
''Then our teacher Teji
will start lecturing them.''

1240
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:46,828
''He says, speak in Punjabi,
start learning the alphabets.''

1241
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:50,558
''He says, speak in Punjabi,
start learning the alphabets.''

1242
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:54,500
''l'll make sure you learn
a lesson before l clear you.''

1243
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,448
Damn you!

1244
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:08,743
Save me!

1245
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,387
Enough!

1246
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,894
Okay, now. The introduction ceremony,
in the English style.

1247
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,388
What are they doing? - What is this?

1248
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:22,964
This is something different?

1249
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,727
ln English style?

1250
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,398
l am sure it must
be something troublesome.

1251
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:31,965
Let's ask the brothers-in-law.

1252
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,501
Look, you are our guests.
You go first.

1253
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:37,770
lt is your right.

1254
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,272
Fine, l'll go.

1255
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:42,781
Stop him.

1256
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:44,511
Hello.

1257
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,554
Hello.

1258
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,421
Jackpot!

1259
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:13,940
Hey!

1260
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:14,983
Hey!

1261
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:23,655
Get off me!

1262
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,727
Nephew! Let go of the girl!
Get off her!

1263
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:26,795
What are you doing?

1264
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,929
What are you doing?
- Revenge.

1265
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,522
The one you keep talking about.

1266
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,329
Revenge? What kind of
a way is this to seek revenge?

1267
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:37,563
ltis not necessary to
seek revenge with violence.

1268
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,368
You idiot!
- Thank you.

1269
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,966
We arenot dead!
We too shall seek revenge.

1270
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:43,544
Simon commission, come here.

1271
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,408
Simon commission,
give me ahug. - Hey!

1272
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,846

Simon commission, come here.

1273
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:48,848
Come on.

1274
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,350
They are jealous.

1275
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:52,847
Have some shame.
You are our son-in-law.

1276
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,455
See! See how crazy they are.

1277
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:59,789
Albert has lost his mind to
get his daughter married to a rustic.

1278
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:02,590
Okay,they are rustics!

1279
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,996
And what have acted as
Godzillain English movies.

1280
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,599
People like you have your
face veiled in the passport photo.

1281
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:09,728
And you say that they are rustics.

1282
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,035
Just a minute.
- Why? They are down to earth.

1283
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,570
She is my mother.

1284
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,001
Huh?

1285
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:19,270
l seek your blessings, aunt.
You are absolutely right.

1286
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:21,315
You guys are not down to earth.

1287
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,906
You don't bathe for three days.

1288
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,350
lt is like the earth
is sticking to your body.

1289
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,485
Come on, aunt. Let's go.
Let's not bother talking to them.

1290
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,423
Hey! Who are you abusing?
- You.

1291
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,026
Kala!

1292
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,454
No one will say anything.

1293
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:36,690
Come on, let's go inside
and have some tea and refreshments.

1294
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,766
Forget the tea,
l suggest lets start drinking.

1295
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:39,492
Let's go.

1296
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,362
Roop, l can't live without you.

1297
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:47,442
Even l can't.
Everything is going to befine.

1298
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,507
But the situation
doesn't seem to be fine.

1299
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,812
Don't worry.
Kala will handle everything.

1300
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,416
Whereis he? l want to see him.

1301
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,982
Here he is.
- Kala!

1302
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,756
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Oh. Hi.

1303
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,455
Thank you so much, Dorgi.

1304
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,622
Dorgi?
- Brother-in-law.

1305
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,291
Are you alright?
Everything alright?

1306
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,592
Everything's alright.

1307
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:14,999
But please help us.

1308
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,800
Only a good impression
of your family can save us.

1309
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,803
My father can allow
us to move to Punjab.

1310
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,442
She has a good command over English.

1311
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,376
She will get offers for tuition
for a minimum of Rs. 5000 per month.

1312
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,311
Don't worry. l will help.

1313
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,713
l will take care of everything.

1314
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:30,808
You just teach her
how to collect dung cakes.

1315
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,316
What did he say?.

1316
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:34,647
He's saying you're so pretty.

1317
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,519
Really?. - You've become smart.

1318
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,554
Handle the situation in
a similar fashion for two days.

1319
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:45,466
Hello. Hello. Hello, down there.

1320
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:49,293
We..we are very happy
you people could be here.

1321
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,635
Two families are coming
together from different countries.

1322
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,306
To be together forever.

1323
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:59,907
l find Roop a very fine young man and
of course my daughter's out of this world.

1324
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:06,818
So, let's celebrateand say a prayer for
a happy marriage between Julia and Roop.

1325

01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,861
Nice job.

1327
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,567
Just a minute.A request.

1328
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:25,799
We don't want to get embarrassed.

1329
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:29,536
No person shall drink
more than 1-2 bottles.

1330
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,882
Ditto.
- No one should drink more than 2 bottles.

1331
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,779
Add some water.
They usually serve stiff drinks.

1332
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,683
Really? Give me some water.

1333
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:42,450
Here you go.

1334
01:17:57,072 --> 01:18:01,270
Uncle! Their women drink neat.

1335
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:01,967
Huh!

1336
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:06,376
lt's wine.
lt's supposed to be drunk neat.

1337
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:09,279
Neat? Then we have been embarrassed.

1338
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,282
We won't take it to our heart.
Let's pick them up.

1339
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:15,515
Pick them up? lfit's
so then let's go, pick them up.

1340
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,990
Hey!- Hey! Not them, pick these.

1341
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,322
Really? - Yes.

1342
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:20,292
Liftit.

1343
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:23,489
Lift the bottle and drink.

1344
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:30,302
Just a minute.

1345
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:31,897
Enough.

1346
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:35,810
Now l will say thank you in English.

1350
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,482
Well done, Mann sahib.

1351
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,647
When you came to our village..

1352
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:51,417
We treated you like our special guest.

1353
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:59,425
Now we are here, so we expect
us to treat us as your special guests.

1354
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:00,496
What's he saying?

1355
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:04,663
And all l was doing was

Well done, Mann sahib.

1362
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:16,947
He spoke in English!

1363
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,418
Where did you learn this from?

1364
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,353
Well..

1365
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:23,916
Maybe we should bring the food.

1366
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:26,516
Fellows. The food.
Food. We're going to bring the food.

1367
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:28,991
They are serving dinner.
- Really?.

1368
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:29,888
Dinner.

Hey! Careful!

Enjoy!

1374
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:41,667
Such a big fish!

1375
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,575
This looks bigger
than our son-in-law.

1376
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:49,013
You should've asked
him and grilled him instead.

1377
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:52,250
You are being insulted.

1378
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:56,447
lnsult? Now you want
the fish to sing your praises?

1379
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:59,288
''Uncle came. He visited us.''

1380
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:02,488
''Uncle trapped a few fishes.''

1381
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:06,499
''Uncle ate a few fishes.''

1382
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:12,807
Enough. Stop.
First let's figure out how to eat it.

1383
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,773
Let's do one thing.

1384
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:16,867
Catch it from its neck.
- Okay.

1385
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:22,974
l will pull its tail.
- Here you go.

1386
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,547
Your aunt fell.

1387
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,023
Whats wrong with aunt?

1388
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,954
lt's okay. lt's okay.
- What's going on?

1389
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:34,961
lt's a small thing.
lt's a small thing.

1390
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,655
Wait, l'll help you get up.

01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,001
Stand up. Help her stand up.

1393
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,596
Pick her up! Careful.

1394
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:47,606
Oh my God! That's disgusting!

1395
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:48,971
Take it easy. Jeez. - What's wrong
with these people? - lt's okay. lt's just flour.

1396
01:20:49,044 --> 01:20:51,945
Oh my God! That's disgusting!
- Jeez.- What's wrong with these people?

1397
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:58,318
Are you sure you want to
get married into this family?.

1398
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:01,285
Do something.
- Come on. Comeon.

1399
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:02,720
Do something.
- Stop it.

1400
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,719
Just stop it.
- Don't touch me.

1401
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,817
Shut up! Shutup!

1402
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:08,922
Quiet!

1403
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:12,624
Oh no. - You don't have
to go with these idiots!

1404
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:14,425
What is he saying?

1405
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:15,861
Nothing, grandpa.

1406
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,337
He is saying that he's
fortunate that his daughter..

1407
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,499
..is going to stay
with such jolly people.

1408
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:24,535
Heis very strange.

1409
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,014
He says such nice things
with such an angry face.

1410
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:29,373
They do all the things
in the reverse order.

1411
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:30,746
The steering is on the wrong side.

1412
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,251
They drive on the wrong side.

1413
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,481
They say sweet things with an angry face.

1414
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:39,259
l...l..
- Dad! - Hello!

1415
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,793
Okay, Naibadh from Khana?
- Yes.

1416
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:51,029
Okay. Ranjit Singh from Sunour?
- l am here.

1417
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,701
Okay. Uncle from Baddi?
- l am here.

1418
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,310
Wonderful. Okay. Both ofyou go home.

1419
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,003
They both want to be the uncle.

1420
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,286
Revenge.

1421
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:16,329
Uncle.

1422
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,263
Revenge.
- Hey!

1423
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,334
Revenge. Revenge. - One shouldn't
be so eager to seek revenge.

1424
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,003
How are you, uncle?
Going for ajog?

1425
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:24,436
Where will l go?

1426
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,700
The bathroom inside is so clean
that l didn't feel like soiling it.

1427
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:28,867
l am looking for an open space.

1428
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,774
Open space? You want to park a truck?

1429
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,507
Listen, you should
show me some respect.

1430
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,277
Respect? Now do you want
me to garland the bottle?

1431
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,377
Whose face did l see
so early in the morning?!

1432
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,284
l think l'll have
a difficult day today.

1433
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,413
Oh no.

1434
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,427
Hey!

1435
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,789
My dwarf Japanese soldier.

1436
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:49,955
Where did you find the gun?

1437
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:55,768
Brother-in-law cannot live a gun like
a mother cannot live without her son.

1438
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,495
l stole it from Albert.

1439
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,900
You had verbally abused me.
Now get ready to get shot.

1440
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,273
l am already dead,
why do you wish to kill me?

1441
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:06,336
Don't shoot, the cops will arrest you.

1442
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:07,005
Why?

1443
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,545
There are Red Cross people in Punjab.

1444
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,848
Cops can arrest us there as well.
l don't shoot here. l don't want to die.

1445
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:16,552
l'll find an open space and shoot.

1446
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:24,330
Alisha,this morning walk
that you do is a very good thing.

1447
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:25,831
This is what l do
in the villageas well.

1448
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,767
Whatever or not l do anything else,
l surely do run.

1449
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:31,600
What's the use? You always lie.

1450
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,867
No. This is something else
which even my left hand can do.

1451
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:36,875
That's your righthand.

1452
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:38,878
l cannot snap my left hand's fingers.

1453
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,941
lt's a very small thing. Don't worry.

1454
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:41,981
lt's a small thing?

1455
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,918
Will you ever start
taking something seriously?

1456
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,881
You will know when everyone
will know the truth.

1457
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:50,017
lt's not a big deal.

1458
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:53,749
l just lied to grandpa that Roop and
Julia will stay there after married.

1459
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:57,025
And l told Roop's father-in-law
that they will stay here.

1460
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,929
lt's not a small thing.
- Yes.

1461
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:04,564
But the thing is only you,
me, Roop and Julia know about this.

1462
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:06,469
No one else knows about this.

1463
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:09,042
God. - So you don't need to worry.
Let's run.

1464
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,436
Do you do yoga?

1465
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,245
Now your uncle also knows.

1466
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,347
Now see how l make you run.

1467
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:22,983
''Today l shall break
all the glassware!''

1468
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,918
''l will send all the relatives back!''

1469
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:27,620
''l will not let the
marriage take place, Kala.''

1470
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:28,923
''Kala..''

1471
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,997
Father!

1472
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,430
Father!

1473
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:32,724
Father!

1474
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:34,299
Father!

1475
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,667
Albert? l will tell him.

1476
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:38,999
Albert!

1477
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,541
Albert!

1478
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:43,470
Albert!

1479
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,408
Albert, you are reading
a newspaper over here?

1480
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:49,483
Now l will give you
breaking news in Punjabi.

1481
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:50,676
Breaking news.

1482
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:54,346
You think they will
stay here after marriage?

1483
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:55,480
They will take care of you?

1484
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,387
No, my naive being.

1485
01:24:57,492 --> 01:25:00,290
They are preparing
to leave for Punjab.

1486
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:05,628
Your fair, beautiful daughter
will go there and cook for everyone.

1487
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:09,294
She will take care of the animals.

1488
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,029
Your daughter's life
will get ruined over there.

1489
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,898
Her? You are talking about her?

1490
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:14,975
What about her?

1491
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:16,503
What? What?

1492
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:19,739
He's illiterate!
He doesn't even know Punjabi.

1493
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:20,639
What?.

1494
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:23,248
What was all that? Explain.

1495
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:26,753
We are so dead! Where's Kala?

1496
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:30,684
l wasn't this happy even
at my son's birth as l am now.

1497
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:31,952
Now l will cause trouble.

1498
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,323
They came here for a marriage.

1499
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:34,690
Now let's see who gets married..

1500
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,388
What does my uncle want to say?.

1501
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:39,432
l.. l will tell everything.

1502
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,331
You broke the match l made,
didn't you?

1503
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:42,664
Now watch me..

1504
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:46,473
Look, don't come any closer to me.

1505
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,566
l am feeling scared.

1506
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,803
After all l am your uncle.

1507
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:52,743
Don't hit me in your fit of anger.

1508
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:56,545
You will take our relationship
into consideration, right?

1509
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:59,682
How can l hit you
with a stick, uncle?

1510
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:01,752
Very good.

1511
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,659
You have tied my hands and
legs but have kept my mouth open.

1512
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,624
One does all the talking
through his mouth.

1513
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:26,539
Kala!

1514
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:27,640
Wait aminute.

1515
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,248
Yes?

1516
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,580
Where is uncle?
l am talking attendance.

1517
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,381
Uncle? - Yes.

1518
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:43,426
Which uncle?

1519
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:46,266
There's just one uncle, not fifty.
Kala's uncle.

1520
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,699
Where is uncle? - He must
be lying unconscious somewhere.

1521
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:51,531
Unconscious?

1522
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,411
Okay. You mean he got
drunk and lost consciousness.

1523
01:26:59,314 --> 01:26:59,712
Yes.

1524
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:02,305
But l have searched the whole house.
l couldn't find him.Just..

1525
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,688
l just needto check this room.
- Hey!

1526
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:11,392
You can enter this room
only over my dead body.

1527
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:16,559
Kala..

1528
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:18,832
Now l will have to kill you?

1529
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,833
That too because of this room?

1530
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:24,902
l can make and break
50 such rooms for you.

1531
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:25,995
You are strange.

1532
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,603
l.. You took this very seriously.

1533
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,404
Okay, l won't enter.
Tell me something else.

1534
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:35,844
But where is uncle?

1535
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:40,410
He's in Canada. l think h eran away.

1536
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:41,419
No, no, no.

1537
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:45,825
Mann sahib had vowed that
if any of his guests runs away..

1538
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:49,522
..then he won't go back to lndia.

1539
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:53,997
Uncle will be at my feet
in the next half an hour.

1540
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:56,894
l just said those things.

1541
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:03,908
Well done. Eat all the sweets.

1542
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:06,639
The buckets should remain full.
Well done.

1543
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:10,616
Listen, the uncle came to me.
He was very excited.

1544
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:13,016
Something about my daughter.
l don't know what it was.

1545
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:14,754
But he was very excited.

1546
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:17,649
Both of them together?

1547
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:21,685
What if grandpa learns English in a few
days he starts understanding everything?

1548
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:23,696
Kala, you are surrounded
with live wire.

1549
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,561
No matter which you touch,
you will die.

1550
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,564
l think l'll need to talk
grandpa into leaving Roop here.

1551
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:29,998
Grandpa!

1552
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:34,301
Just like that..

1553
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:39,369
Kale, they just served
us sweets with tea. lt's great.

1554
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,677
These are sugar cubes. You have to
dissolve them in the tea before drinking it.

1555
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:43,375
Oh really?

1556
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:44,883
You brought us here to get insulted!

1557
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:46,010
You guys never respect us.

1558
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:47,754
He came to me.
Hewas very excited..- Grandpa..

1559
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:48,617
l don't know what..

1560
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:51,992
l needed to talk to you.

1561
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,518
Keep him ata distance.
Don't mingle with him alot.

1562
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:58,326
Today l wish to give
you at our of Canada.

1563
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,833
Come with me. - lt's not necessary.

1564
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:02,835
We too want to go.

1565
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:05,633
Grandpa, l cannot take
their responsibility.

1566
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:07,331
What if any one of
them tries to run away?

1567
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,271
How can anyone run away?.

1568
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:12,471
Mann sahib with be guarding
with a riffle and taking attendance.

1569
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,844
He will diebut he
won't let anyone run away.

1570
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:38,898
People say that guy
ran miles away in Canada.

1571
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,035
l cannot even run for a kilometre.

1572
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,704
Mann, no more running.

1573
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:46,004
Who knows this road might
lead straight to Punjab.

1574
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:48,479
You never know how unlucky you are.

1575
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,881
Oh no.

1576
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:52,851
Damn!

1577
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:54,987
Such big building.

1578
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:58,588
So many glasses.

1579
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,687
No one can survive a fall from them.

1580
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:02,262
Where do l have to go?

1581
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:05,864
Where did l write the address?

1582
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:07,332
lt's here, in my pocket.

1583
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:10,400
Okay.

1584
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:12,336
Fine.

1585
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:13,269
Yes.

1586
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,702
l'll ask someone over here.

1587
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:16,799
Let's go.

1588
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:23,450
''The whole world is my play ground,
my beloved.''

1589
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:28,412
With my new car.

1590
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:29,948
Get jealous, villagers.

1591
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:31,422
Send.

1592
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:32,918
Raja!

1593
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:34,821
Raja...

1594
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:38,690
New car?
- Yes.

1595
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:39,990
Brother Raja!

1596
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:41,663
How are you?

1597
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,292
Good.

1598
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:43,631
You are doing well.

1599
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:46,601
You hardly had
a cyclein the village.

1600
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:48,641
That too was kept together
with a piece of cloth.

1601
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:51,234
This is great.
You brought a new car.

1602
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,273
Listen, don't talk about the past.

1603
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,246
l have a reputation over here.

1604
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:59,444
l change my car after
every three days.

1605
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,351
After every three days.

1606
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:02,582
Don't lean on it, bro.

1607
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:03,786
What is he saying?

1608
01:31:05,426 --> 01:31:06,450
He wants the car.

1609
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:07,357
What?.

1610
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:11,021
Huh?

1611
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,640
Hello? Yes? Where to?

1612
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:27,574
According to this you change
your cars every 3 minutes not 3 days.

1613
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:29,582
Everyone in the village
must be saying..

1614
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:32,482
Raja bought a car in
Canada within three months!

1615
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:33,576
Then what should one do?

1616
01:31:33,688 --> 01:31:35,019
lt's not even been 6
months since one came here..

1617
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,655
..and people like you call and ask,
''brother, send the photo of your new car.''

1618
01:31:37,758 --> 01:31:39,521
Then this is how one will send it.

1619
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:41,591
Now listen to me.

1620
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,720
Now that you ran and came here..

1621
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,628
Now run and work.
Come, my brother. - No.

1622
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:49,328
First show me around a little.
lntroduce me to a few beautiful girls.

1623
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:51,327
This isn't your
mother's maternal home.

1624
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:54,499
Here everyone from
young to old has to work.

1625
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:55,507
What?.
- Yes.

1626
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,305
Are you telling the truth?
- Do you want it in writing?

1627
01:31:57,645 --> 01:32:00,443
Oh really?
Now Mann sahib too will have to work?

1628
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:02,540
Let's go.

1629
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:11,385
First all the panes,
then cars, then the driveway.

1630
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,983
You have to wash them all.
Get to work.

1631
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:15,660
Hello? So much work?

1632
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:19,794
This is nothing.
Here one has to work so much that..

1633
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:22,335
..while working one
thinks he has become fair.

1634
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,802
But he doesn't become fair,
he is pruned.

1635
01:32:25,306 --> 01:32:27,536
Get to work, my brother. Come on.

1636
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:31,672
Mann sahib will do so much work?

1637
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:34,948
He will have to do it.
Anyway, no one is watching.

1638
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:36,612
Come on.

1639
01:32:39,453 --> 01:32:41,011
How do l do it?

1640
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:44,485
Okay. l gotit.

1641
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:48,862
Okay, Mann.

1642
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:57,027
Oh..

1643
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:12,685
People of our village wouldn't
have stopped worshipping such a door.

1644
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:32,805
l don't want to stay here..

1645
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:36,841
Forget the people here even the doors
don't let you come close to them.

1646
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:40,311
Mann sahib, respectfully go back.

1647
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:47,321
Julia will beso happy in Punjab.

1648
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:49,651
lt's so beautiful and peaceful.

1649
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:50,883
l've been there, remember?

1650
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:53,688
lt became so after you left.

1651
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,564
l mean when you come here..
now very peaceful.

1652
01:33:57,665 --> 01:33:58,689
Very peaceful.

1653
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,398
How was the firing?

1654
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,768
Right. Peaceful. Thank you.

1655
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,271
Brother-in-law, you..

1656
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:11,411
Oh, the smell of the first shot.

1657
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,838
What have you done!

1658
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:14,744
What have you done,the one
who wears turban the other way!

1659
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:15,838
l just fired.

1660
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,713
Nothing is going to
fall down from the sky.

1661
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:23,253
Kala..

1662
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:25,392
Did l kill a peacock?

1663
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,825
lt's not a peacock.
lt's Doraemon.

1664
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:30,260
Not Doraemon, it's Spiderman.

1665
01:34:30,364 --> 01:34:33,424
Yes, right.
- Who is he? Which song had he sung?

1666
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:36,526
There is life beyond singers.
They are cartoon characters.

1667
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:37,661
Okay. Cartoon.

1668
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:38,966
Hewill never get up! Never!

1669
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:41,337
Hey!
- Hey!

1670
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,401
He got up!
My bullet got wasted!

1671
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,002
Give me the gun!
- Give it back.

1672
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:47,473
We were just about to convince him..

1673
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:50,612
l feel like hitting you.

1674
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:51,480
Hey!

1675
01:34:51,585 --> 01:34:55,715
You have ruined Uday Pratap Singh!

1676
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:59,452
God, give me a chance
to leave their sister.

1677
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,027
Then they will come begging to me..

1678
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:02,352
''Brother-in-law,take her back!''

1679
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:03,691
''Brother-in-law,take her back!''

1680
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:07,997
''l came to Canada for a wedding.''

1681
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:10,668
Why are you following me?

1682
01:35:10,771 --> 01:35:15,265
''Gurjant Singh will seek revenge!''

1683
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,812
''l will seek revenge with her today!''

1684
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:21,379
Revenge. Revenge. Revenge.

1685
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:23,382
Revenge. Revenge. Revenge.

1686
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:26,247
Where did she go?

1687
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:28,277
l think she is in here.

1688
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:31,882
Anna!

1689
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,691
Aunt!

1690
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:37,325
Anna!

1691
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:47,664
Anna,whereare you?

1692
01:35:49,343 --> 01:35:50,332
Anna!

1693
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:56,445
Bulatewala? Are you drunk?

1694
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:00,918
Did you molest a foreigner?

1695
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:03,256
Wait.

1696
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:05,482
You hit our uncle with a stick?

1697
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:06,855
l hit him with whatever
l found near me.

1698
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:09,521
There is no science in it.
Don't think too much about it.

1699
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:10,722
He hit you when we
have come for the wedding.

1700
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:13,356
ln future they might
tryto attack me.

1701
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:16,493
Hey, how can they?
l am still alive, l am not dead.

1702
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:17,730
You are great, brother-in-law.

1703
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:20,330
Uncle, are you sober now?

1704
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:21,931
Why? Are you high?

1705
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:24,602
No. The stick.

1706
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:26,377
Did you tell uncle about it?

1707
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,504
l know everything now.

1708
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:28,673
He told me everything.

1709
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,248
He told you?

1710
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:34,482
You have already hit me.

1711
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:36,021
Now don't shoot at both of us.

1712
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:40,687
Uncle..

1713
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:41,955
God bless you.

1714
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:43,859
He is my brave son.

1715
01:36:45,499 --> 01:36:46,989
l wonder where both the uncles are.

1716
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:48,996
Now in this country,
l won't let anyone run away.

1717
01:36:55,543 --> 01:36:56,373
Hey!

1718
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:57,773
Hey!

1719
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:00,844
What's happening inside?

1720
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:05,545
Hey! You'll once again have
to enterpassing over my dead body.

1721
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:10,281
Brother,tell me..
You are strange.

1722
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:11,688
Both the uncles are
missing since morning.

1723
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:13,259
l wonder where they are.

1724
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:14,959
Who's inside?

1725
01:37:15,062 --> 01:37:17,394
Both the uncles.
You want to meet them?

1726
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:18,890
Hey! Let go ofme.

1727
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:21,763
Uncle is inside.
- What will he be doing there?

1728
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:23,996
Both the uncles are inside.
Yeah, right.

1729
01:37:24,405 --> 01:37:25,497
They are inside.
Let's go meet them.

1730
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:27,837
Let go of me.
- Come with me. Listen..- l know.

1731
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,706
Uncle is..
- Forget it..

1732
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:42,680
Ah! You found it.

1733
01:37:43,324 --> 01:37:44,882
The fellow on the horse,
that's my father.

1734
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:47,722
'Albert is cheerfully saying that..'

1735
01:37:47,828 --> 01:37:50,797
'The man on the horse
is his grandfather.'

1736
01:37:50,898 --> 01:37:53,628
Maybe. But the guy on the horse,
my father.

1737
01:37:55,669 --> 01:37:56,567
My father.

1738
01:37:57,004 --> 01:38:03,876
Well, okay. - But this guy, the
guy in charge of the stick, my father.

1739
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:07,639
Your father is on the horse
and my poor father..

1740
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:08,942
This means..

1741
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:14,678
Your father hit my father?

1742
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,016
Well, maybe so, but l don't know.

1743
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:18,450
Your father hit my father?

1744
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:21,726
Kala! Roop! Where are you?

1745
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:24,362
Come here immediately! Hurry up!

1746
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:26,764
Yes, grandpa?

1747
01:38:27,935 --> 01:38:31,894
His father hit my father.

1748
01:38:35,976 --> 01:38:38,911
He's our great grandfather?
l have never seen his photo.

1749
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:40,981
Stop your nonsense, Kala!

1750
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,677
Or this marriage will not take place!

1751
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:47,852
What are you saying, grandpa?

1752
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:49,751
What do you think,
if you cancel the wedding and leave,..

1753
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:50,846
..the villagers will believe it?

1754
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:54,988
We will get humiliated in the village if
we go back without your daughter-in-law.

1755
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:57,329
No one will believe that we are
the ones who cancelled the wedding.

1756
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:59,956
Everyone will think that these
people insulted us and cancelled it.

1757
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:02,536
So many ofthem had come in trolleys..

1758
01:39:02,536 --> 01:39:02,934
..to see us off.

1759
01:39:03,704 --> 01:39:04,830
We will lose our
honour in the village.

1760
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,134
The rest is up to you.

1761
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:08,741
This honour will kill me.

1762
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:16,644
Grandpa..
- Now how will you handle this?

1763
01:39:17,885 --> 01:39:21,446
This is very easy,
can do it with my left hand.

1764
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:23,854
And this is my left hand.
-Just shut up!

1765
01:39:24,425 --> 01:39:26,791
You still think this is a joke?!

1766
01:39:26,894 --> 01:39:28,953
You are playing with
everyone's emotions.

1767
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:31,325
Do you even have a heart?

1768
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:33,630
My mom was right about all of you.

1769
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:35,696
l am not going to trust any of you.

1770
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:37,695
You are such aliar!

1771
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,500
Don't ever talk to me again!

1772
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:22,678
Look, l am pretty sure Alisha
didn't mean anything that she said.

1773
01:40:22,783 --> 01:40:25,684
And l wanted to thank you
for helping me and Roop out.

1774
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:27,481
lt really means a lot to me.

1775
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:31,956
lt's alright. Good.

1776
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:33,450
Thanks.

1777
01:40:55,816 --> 01:40:56,840
l am sorry.

1778
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:03,647
l am sorry.

1779
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:11,522
l know that you are not wrong.

1780
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:14,031
But the way you are
handling it is wrong.

1781
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:20,700
Okay. You will handle everything.

1782
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:24,435
l am sorry.

1783
01:41:26,413 --> 01:41:27,345
Strange.

1784
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:30,383
l am saying sorry and
you aren't saying anything.

1785
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:36,387
Attitude.

1786
01:41:39,059 --> 01:41:40,993
l think he's being stubborn.

1787
01:41:44,798 --> 01:41:49,462
l didn't know something
could even affect you.

1788
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:53,336
Okay then.

1789
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:58,300
l cannot even touch your hair..

1790
01:41:58,412 --> 01:42:03,315
Otherwise you'll say, l am in love
with you because l touched your hair.

1791
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,684
You want to send the
moon back on a bucket?

1792
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:09,923
''l am sure this is
the effect of your love.''

1793
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:15,452
''l am sure this is
the effect of your love.''

1794
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:17,360
l still remember it.

1795
01:42:18,699 --> 01:42:23,261
''My heart is so restless.''

1796
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:26,999
l swear on God, l am notlying.

1797
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:44,424
''l want to torture the heart.''

1798
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:47,688
''l want to torture the heart.''

1799
01:42:47,794 --> 01:42:50,524
''My beloved is like kohl.''

1800
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:53,600
''l want to adorn him in my eyes.''

1801
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:56,635
''My beloved is like kohl.''

1802
01:42:56,737 --> 01:43:00,434
''l want to adorn him in my eyes.''

1803
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:04,443
''Mr. Black, please come back.''

1804
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:08,379
''Mr. Black, please come back.''

1805
01:43:08,482 --> 01:43:12,384
''Take me along,
l have my bags packed.''

1806
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,386
''l have my bags packed.''

1807
01:43:14,488 --> 01:43:18,447
''l am sad and heart broken
because of him.''

1808
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:22,427
''He doesn't know that
my heart beats for him.''

1809
01:43:22,496 --> 01:43:23,895
''l am a  live wire!''

1810
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:27,627
''Make the fair ones go away!''

1811
01:43:27,734 --> 01:43:30,760
''My beloved is dark,
make the fair ones go away.''

1812
01:43:31,071 --> 01:43:32,368
''l am a live wire!''

1813
01:43:32,472 --> 01:43:33,939
''Make the fair ones go away!''

1814
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,874
''l like him,
make the fair ones go away.''

1815
01:43:36,977 --> 01:43:39,241
''Make them go away.''

1816
01:43:46,954 --> 01:43:49,388
''My eyes are stuck on you.''

1817
01:43:49,489 --> 01:43:50,956
''You are the only one l see.''

1818
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:52,423
''Don't let go of my hand.''

1819
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:53,458
''Take my heart.''

1820
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:55,017
''Take my heart away, my beloved.''

1821
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:58,321
''l swear,
l don't want to stay alone.''

1822
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:03,460
''l want to always be with you,
even if you reject me.''

1823
01:44:03,537 --> 01:44:06,472
''l swear,
l don't want to stay alone.''

1824
01:44:06,673 --> 01:44:11,701
''l want to always be with you,
even if you reject me.''

1825
01:44:11,812 --> 01:44:15,805
''People have started
talking about us.''

1826
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:19,716
''God has made our match.''

1827
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:21,617
''l am a live wire!''

1828
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:24,814
''Make the fair ones go away!''

1829
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:28,019
''My beloved is dark,
make the fair ones go away.''

1830
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:29,761
''l am a live wire!''

1831
01:44:29,863 --> 01:44:30,989
''Make the fair ones go away!''

1832
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:34,495
''l like him,
make the fair ones go away.''

1833
01:44:34,568 --> 01:44:35,500
''Make them go away.''

1834
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:36,899
''Make them go away.''

1835
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:39,996
''Make them go away.''

1836
01:44:46,546 --> 01:44:49,674
l had told you,
but you didn't listen to me.

1837
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,608
Why didn't you keep your promise?

1838
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,311
What you did with your
mother was not right.

1839
01:44:55,756 --> 01:44:59,283
Stop it, aunt. Now l feel like crying.

1840
01:44:59,526 --> 01:45:03,326
No. Why will you cry?.
You should laugh. Laugh!

1841
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:06,888
You have hit a jackpot. A
foreign national is in love with you.

1842
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,399
You just saved Rs. 50-60 lakhs.

1843
01:45:08,502 --> 01:45:09,992
You didn't have to
go to an agent either.

1844
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:13,464
Mom, it is not so.

1845
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,972
What? She is right.
- Saw that?

1846
01:45:16,076 --> 01:45:18,306
No, mom.
- What?

1847
01:45:18,412 --> 01:45:20,346
Try to understand, Kale.
- Oh. Okay.

1848
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:23,541
What okay.
Everything is going wrong.

1849
01:45:24,284 --> 01:45:26,775
Excuse me,
is everything alright?

1850
01:45:26,887 --> 01:45:28,377
Yeah, it's fine,Julia.

1851
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:29,477
Nothing is fine.

1852
01:45:29,556 --> 01:45:31,353
You don't talk to me.

1853
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:34,283
Someone please offer me some tea.

1854
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:36,590
l'll make it on my own.

1855
01:45:37,564 --> 01:45:39,828
They don't even add sugar in it.

1856
01:45:40,634 --> 01:45:43,535
Stay away from my daughter, rustic.

1857
01:45:46,707 --> 01:45:49,870
She adds alot of sugar in
her tea and she calls me rustic.

1858
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:54,575
And you are otherwise always
for the truth and now you are lying.

1859
01:45:55,582 --> 01:45:57,482
Mom's mood was not good.

1860
01:45:57,851 --> 01:45:59,443
l too am being ruled
by other people's mood.

1861
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:04,481
But don't you worry.
l'll set everything straight.

1862
01:46:23,577 --> 01:46:26,307
'Guy on the horse..'

1863
01:46:26,413 --> 01:46:28,313
'My father.'

1864
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:31,818
'The guy with the stick..'

1865
01:46:31,985 --> 01:46:33,612
'My father.'

1866
01:46:36,523 --> 01:46:39,321
'Your father.. hit my father?'

1867
01:47:11,992 --> 01:47:13,516
Grandpa, that hurts!

1868
01:47:13,627 --> 01:47:15,527
Why have you come here?

1869
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:18,260
You will hit a person
while he is sleeping?

1870
01:47:18,365 --> 01:47:19,593
What's wrong with your pride?

1871
01:47:20,467 --> 01:47:21,900
l will hit him!

1872
01:47:22,536 --> 01:47:24,936
What? You're gonna
hit me with a stick?

1873
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:27,631
Stick?

1874
01:47:27,741 --> 01:47:29,402
No, no, no. Not you, not you.

1875
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:30,703
Tiger. Tiger.

1876
01:47:31,545 --> 01:47:33,376
What do they call it?

1877
01:47:33,747 --> 01:47:36,614
Snake. Snake.
Snake.- There's a snake!

1878
01:47:36,716 --> 01:47:37,774
What? Where?

1879
01:47:37,884 --> 01:47:39,249
He knows. He knows.

1880
01:47:39,352 --> 01:47:40,410
Let me ask. Let me ask.

1881
01:47:40,487 --> 01:47:42,853
Grandpa,
they hit in front of everyone.

1882
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:44,787
We too will hit him
in front of everyone.

1883
01:47:44,891 --> 01:47:46,358
Let the wedding take place first.

1884
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:50,296
Why are you whispering?
Snakes don't have ears.

1885
01:47:52,032 --> 01:47:53,897
Even he doesn't have ears.

1886
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:58,800
Grandpa, l suggest we
hit him with spiked stick.

1887
01:47:59,072 --> 01:48:02,269
lt'll pierce him and hurt him.

1888
01:48:02,676 --> 01:48:04,576
l don't like what you are saying.

1889
01:48:04,678 --> 01:48:05,736
But its good.

1890
01:48:05,846 --> 01:48:09,282
Then think about the good.
We will start liking it later.

1891
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:13,751
Think about when we will
hit him in front of everyone.

1892
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:18,621
You go and think about
what will happen in the morning.

1893
01:48:19,392 --> 01:48:21,257
l will go and make arrangements.
- Hurry up and get them.

1894
01:48:21,895 --> 01:48:25,387
Don't worry. Even he doesn't
know where the snakeis.

1895
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:26,363
Sure.
- Sleep.

1896
01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:27,296
Okay.
- Sorry.

1897
01:48:27,734 --> 01:48:30,669
God, l am handling
everyone all by myself.

1898
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:32,702
lt's your duty to help me.
Please help me.

1899
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:45,384
''l am lost in your thoughts.''

1900
01:48:45,485 --> 01:48:53,392
''Beloved, l am yours.''

1901
01:48:53,560 --> 01:49:00,489
''Why are you troubling me?''

1902
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:06,800
''Why are you so far away from me?''

1903
01:49:07,674 --> 01:49:13,476
''Why are you so far away from me?''

1904
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:43,677
''For the peacock,
l make a necklace.''

1905
01:49:43,677 --> 01:49:51,345
''For the peacock,
l make a necklace.''

1906
01:49:51,451 --> 01:49:54,978
''When it's time to wear the necklace..''

1907
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:58,689
''To use the necklace..''

1908
01:49:58,792 --> 01:50:01,317
''When it's time to wear
the necklace, and use it..''

1909
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:07,765
''Why do you fly away, oh peacock?''

1910
01:50:08,001 --> 01:50:11,937
''Oh peacock!''

1911
01:50:12,038 --> 01:50:16,600
''Why do you fly away, oh peacock?''

1912
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:22,307
''Why do you fly away, oh peacock?''

1913
01:50:23,049 --> 01:50:25,711
Hello.- Wonderful.

1914
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:28,583
You look great.

1915
01:50:28,688 --> 01:50:31,714
That's great, Kala.

1916
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,722
Well, grandpa, l am ready.

1917
01:50:34,828 --> 01:50:37,490
l am ready since a long time.

1918
01:50:37,664 --> 01:50:39,029
Grandpa,
l am talking about the wedding.

1919
01:50:39,332 --> 01:50:40,697
l too am talking about the wedding.

1920
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,858
Then it's fine.
- Okay.

1921
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:42,935
Look at this.

1922
01:50:43,336 --> 01:50:44,701
This is worth Rs. 2000.

1923
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:46,897
We will hurt him by throwing it.

1924
01:50:47,007 --> 01:50:50,340
Absolutely.
- Hold this.

1925
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:52,241
My grandpa looks amazing.

1926
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:53,835
Really?

1927
01:50:54,514 --> 01:50:55,378
lt's something.

1928
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:57,712
Give me my stick back.
lt's something, right!

1929
01:50:57,917 --> 01:50:58,975
Okay.

1930
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:02,882
Listen? Where is your uncle?

1931
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:03,546
Call him.

1932
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:04,646
Let's take him along.

1933
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:06,419
Forget it.
Why should we take him along?

1934
01:51:06,526 --> 01:51:07,652
He gets upset over small things.

1935
01:51:07,727 --> 01:51:08,887
He will ruin the wedding.

1936
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:12,362
lt's okay. You don't let him speak.
Keep his mouth shut.

1937
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:15,031
Go and get up. Hurry up.

1938
01:51:15,568 --> 01:51:16,694
Hurry up, Kala.

1939
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:18,397
l have already kept his mouth shut.

1940
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:19,904
Now l fear if he opens it..

1941
01:51:26,713 --> 01:51:28,647
The wedding procession
is about to leave.

1942
01:51:28,848 --> 01:51:33,751
How can the wedding procession
leave without me firing a bullet?

1943
01:51:34,788 --> 01:51:35,948
From here.

1944
01:51:40,894 --> 01:51:44,921
l can smell it.
lt's in here. My job is done.

1945
01:52:09,856 --> 01:52:11,619
lt's been worth while to be in Canada.

1946
01:52:11,825 --> 01:52:12,655
Kale!

1947
01:52:12,892 --> 01:52:14,917
lt's getting late. Let's go.

1948
01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:16,621
You too want to go?

1949
01:52:16,996 --> 01:52:19,487
They are getting married
in their style now.

1950
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:21,698
Seniors can't go there.

1951
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:23,596
Why can't they?.

1952
01:52:23,703 --> 01:52:25,466
How do l explain it?.

1953
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:28,405
lt's not a family style of a wedding.

1954
01:52:28,508 --> 01:52:30,533
The girl and the boy, they..

1955
01:52:30,643 --> 01:52:33,237
We know what they do.

1956
01:52:33,346 --> 01:52:35,280
We will go there.
- We will go there.

1957
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:37,372
We will go there.

1958
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:38,815
We have come to Canada to attend the wedding.
- Thank God the old ladies didn't come.

1959
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:44,451
Don't worry, nephew.
l'll see how you get married today.

1960
01:52:44,557 --> 01:52:46,650
Let's go. Come with me.
l'll see what he does.

1961
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,692
Look!

1962
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:53,791
Where to?

1963
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,734
Hey, what do you think..

1964
01:52:56,836 --> 01:52:57,768
Hey!

1965
01:52:58,404 --> 01:53:01,862
Kala, do you think you
can stop all three ofus?

1966
01:53:01,975 --> 01:53:05,274
Yes, l can.
- Then try and stop us.

1967
01:53:05,378 --> 01:53:06,936
One..

1968
01:53:07,046 --> 01:53:10,504
Run! - Where did they go!
- Back to aunt.

1969
01:53:10,917 --> 01:53:11,906
Hey!

1970
01:53:12,018 --> 01:53:12,746
Yes?

1971
01:53:13,019 --> 01:53:13,644
Where to?

1972
01:53:13,753 --> 01:53:14,913
l will have to run away.

1973
01:53:15,488 --> 01:53:17,547
Didn't you feel ashamed
to hide everything from me?

1974
01:53:17,657 --> 01:53:21,753
Forget about that if they tell grandpa
about everything then he will shoot me.

1975
01:53:45,685 --> 01:53:46,413
Grandpa..

1976
01:53:46,519 --> 01:53:47,918
Stop your nonsense!

1977
01:53:48,955 --> 01:53:53,722
You lied to me?

1978
01:53:54,494 --> 01:54:00,433
Where did l go wrong in bring you up..

1979
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:04,629
Where did l go wrong that
you humiliated me before the world?

1980
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:08,439
Yes?

1981
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:09,975
Tell me..

1982
01:54:10,543 --> 01:54:11,532
Tell me!

1983
01:54:11,644 --> 01:54:15,307
Forget about it.
Be grateful that the mess is over.

1984
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:19,482
Do one thing. Pack your bags,
let's go and take care of our fields.

1985
01:54:19,586 --> 01:54:20,280
Right, son?

1986
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:21,751
No.

1987
01:54:22,622 --> 01:54:27,616
Najjar Singh has given his word that
too in front of all the villagers.

1988
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:29,685
l have come here to get Roop married.

1989
01:54:30,296 --> 01:54:32,594
And l will return
only after he is married.

1990
01:54:32,932 --> 01:54:35,696
l will make Julia my daughter-in-law.
Understood?

1991
01:54:35,802 --> 01:54:37,736
Alisha, what's he on about?

1992
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:40,934
l..

1993
01:54:44,477 --> 01:54:47,776
Uncle, he's saying, after the wedding
he's gonna take Julia with him.

1994
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:49,003
To lndia. To live.

1995
01:54:49,315 --> 01:54:51,579
Absolutely impossible.

1996
01:54:52,919 --> 01:54:57,288
You fair-skinned lad, you
cannot take my daughter-in-law away.

1997
01:54:57,924 --> 01:54:59,357
Roop, l am warning you.

1998
01:54:59,459 --> 01:55:01,757
Get out of here otherwise
l am calling the police.

1999
01:55:01,861 --> 01:55:04,694
What did you say? Police?
You are talking about the police?

2000
01:55:04,797 --> 01:55:07,698
Call the police.
- Yeah. Police. Get out.

2001
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,665
Get out. Get out now.

2002
01:55:09,769 --> 01:55:11,828
Get out. Get outnow. Now.

2003
01:55:11,938 --> 01:55:14,998
All of you people. Out! Now! Go!

2004
01:55:15,308 --> 01:55:17,003
Out! Out! Out!

2005
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:45,928
Father, let bygones be bygones.

2006
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,539
What's the use of staying here now?

2007
01:55:49,442 --> 01:55:50,875
Everyone has gone to the airport.

2008
01:55:51,878 --> 01:55:53,505
Let's go. We should go there.

2009
01:55:53,613 --> 01:55:57,709
Why? What's so special in
the village that we have to go there?

2010
01:55:57,817 --> 01:55:59,580
How will you face the people there?

2011
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:02,449
l suggest let's stay back.

2012
01:56:02,722 --> 01:56:04,713
l tried running away.
We won't survive.

2013
01:56:05,058 --> 01:56:06,650
One needs to work to survive here.

2014
01:56:06,859 --> 01:56:07,917
That's what we cannot do.

2015
01:56:08,328 --> 01:56:10,728
We will have to go back.
Only Punjab can take care of us.

2016
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:14,263
No!

2017
01:56:14,767 --> 01:56:17,463
Najjar Singh has given his word.

2018
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:20,605
And now it is the
question of our honour.

2019
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:22,468
Bhujjowaliya..

2020
01:56:23,076 --> 01:56:24,566
lt is the question of your honour.

2021
01:56:25,745 --> 01:56:26,541
Barlatewaliya..

2022
01:56:26,646 --> 01:56:28,011
lt is the question of your honour.

2023
01:56:28,614 --> 01:56:31,515
And nephew, it is also
the question of your honour.

2024
01:56:34,787 --> 01:56:36,812
You two letit be.

2025
01:56:37,323 --> 01:56:38,585
Hello. l'll call you back.
Love you. Love you.

2026
01:56:38,691 --> 01:56:40,352
Grandpa, l spoke to Julia.

2027
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:41,722
She is ready to go with us.

2028
01:56:41,928 --> 01:56:43,020
She agreed.

2029
01:56:43,329 --> 01:56:44,853
l told you,
everything will work out.

2030
01:56:44,964 --> 01:56:45,726
Shut up.

2031
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:49,332
l say, if anyone has a phone,
let's talk to Anna as well.

2032
01:56:49,435 --> 01:56:50,663
My life will also get settled.

2033
01:56:50,737 --> 01:56:52,261
l suggest you let it be, uncle.

2034
01:56:52,372 --> 01:56:54,340
You won't be able to handle her.

2035
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:55,429
Shut up.

2036
01:56:56,776 --> 01:56:58,641
All of you go to the airport.

2037
01:56:59,412 --> 01:57:01,937
l'll go and get my daughter-in-law.

2038
01:57:03,349 --> 01:57:04,680
Let's go.
- Let's go, son.

2039
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:08,988
But no one smart is going with them.

2040
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:10,515
Kale, you go with them. Go.

2041
01:57:10,623 --> 01:57:11,555
Thank you.

2042
01:57:49,929 --> 01:57:51,021
Whats up, baby?.

2043
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:52,922
What? Shut up.

2044
01:57:53,032 --> 01:57:54,499
Don't be scared.

2045
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:56,000
Grab her purse!

2046
01:57:56,302 --> 01:57:59,430
Let go!
- Come on!

2047
01:57:59,539 --> 01:58:01,006
No! Let go of me!

2048
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:02,365
Let go!

2049
01:58:02,475 --> 01:58:04,466
Get out ofhere, old man!
- Dad!

2050
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:06,472
Let go! No!

2051
01:58:06,779 --> 01:58:10,340
Having fun, huh!
- Let go.

2052
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:15,382
Let go!

2053
01:58:15,521 --> 01:58:16,453
Stop it!

2054
01:58:18,724 --> 01:58:19,918
Just let her go!

2055
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:21,757
Help me.
- Give me the purse!

2056
01:58:23,029 --> 01:58:23,757
Back off!

2057
01:58:25,731 --> 01:58:26,823
Give me the purse.

2058
01:58:27,867 --> 01:58:31,030
l said give me the damn purse!
Come on, hurry up!

2059
01:58:32,805 --> 01:58:34,295
l'll blow her brains out.

2060
01:58:34,407 --> 01:58:36,432
Wait..
- Grandpa. No, grandpa.

2061
01:58:36,542 --> 01:58:37,668
Give me the purse.

2062
01:58:38,444 --> 01:58:39,968
Okay. Okay.

2063
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:55,725
Grandpa!

2064
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:59,264
No!

2065
01:59:00,733 --> 01:59:01,665
Grandpa!

2066
01:59:02,635 --> 01:59:03,761
Grandpa!

2067
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:05,767
No!
- Grandpa!

2068
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:16,505
Grandpa!

2069
02:00:02,628 --> 02:00:03,390
Oh my God.

2070
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:07,291
Hey, you gave my blood to him?

2071
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:09,629
Don't you have any shame?

2072
02:00:09,735 --> 02:00:12,863
No, grandpa.
We are giving his blood to you.

2073
02:00:12,972 --> 02:00:14,337
What did you say?

2074
02:00:14,574 --> 02:00:17,702
You gave me his blood?

2075
02:00:17,810 --> 02:00:19,004
Get it out of my system!

2076
02:00:19,312 --> 02:00:21,280
Should we use buckets to get it out?

2077
02:00:22,014 --> 02:00:23,641
l mean we were helpless.
We had to take it.

2078
02:00:23,749 --> 02:00:25,683
Your blood type is rare.

2079
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:27,980
Then we asked uncle to give it.
- Shutup.

2080
02:00:29,288 --> 02:00:29,777
Okay..

2081
02:00:29,956 --> 02:00:32,857
Listen, l know how
angry you've been with me.

2082
02:00:33,025 --> 02:00:34,617
'Albert is saying that..'

2083
02:00:35,027 --> 02:00:37,325
'l know that you are angry.'

2084
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:38,995
And.. and you are right.

2085
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:41,659
From the beginning
you have been right.

2086
02:00:42,335 --> 02:00:46,772
'We ruled you,troubled you..'

2087
02:00:46,939 --> 02:00:51,273
'But in spite ofthat you risked

she'll be happy with your family.'

2093
02:01:06,025 --> 02:01:10,485
l think she should go.

2094
02:01:11,664 --> 02:01:12,892
Honest.

2095
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:17,334
What is he saying?

2096
02:01:17,436 --> 02:01:19,267
Grandpa, he is apologising to you.

2097
02:01:19,372 --> 02:01:21,363
And he is saying that
you can take Julia to lndia.

2098
02:01:21,474 --> 02:01:22,634
Shut up.

2099
02:01:25,411 --> 02:01:27,345
Liar.

2100
02:01:30,483 --> 02:01:31,643
Dear, you tell me.

2101
02:01:33,019 --> 02:01:36,716
Uncle is saying that
you can take his daughter.

2102
02:01:36,822 --> 02:01:39,256
And that my daughter will

02:01:39,358 --> 02:01:40,552
Yes!

2104
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:43,356
From now, my daughter belongs to you.

2105
02:01:43,763 --> 02:01:46,425
You can takeher
and please forgiveme.

2106
02:01:47,967 --> 02:01:50,902
Shut up.
- Thank you so much, Kale.

2107
02:01:59,845 --> 02:02:06,648
lf it is so then l
too let go of the enmity.

2108
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,845
l can do anything for my family.

2109
02:02:09,955 --> 02:02:12,685
l have two grandsons.

2110
02:02:14,727 --> 02:02:16,854
lt's okay if one of them stays here.

2111
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:25,627
Kale, you will go
back to Punjab with me?

2112
02:02:27,973 --> 02:02:35,402
We'll find a nice
girl for you over there.

2113
02:02:55,334 --> 02:02:58,861
First of all,
l don't consent to this marriage.

2114
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:05,704
But if you have lost your
mind then remember you'll have..

2115
02:03:05,945 --> 02:03:08,539
..to stay here after marriage.

2116
02:03:09,882 --> 02:03:11,008
But mom..

2117
02:03:11,317 --> 02:03:13,649
What, mom?
One of them can stay here, right?

2118
02:03:13,753 --> 02:03:16,244
Then he can stay here
and Roop can go to Punjab.

2119
02:03:16,922 --> 02:03:18,651
But that has already been decided.

2120
02:03:18,824 --> 02:03:19,916
Roop will stay here.

2121
02:03:20,025 --> 02:03:22,516
Why? Why can't you stay here?

2122
02:03:22,862 --> 02:03:24,386
Both of you stay here.

2123
02:03:24,597 --> 02:03:27,395
But then grandpa..
- Saw that?

2124
02:03:27,733 --> 02:03:29,894
He is either thinking about
his grandfather or his brother.

2125
02:03:30,002 --> 02:03:31,594
How will he ever truly belong to you?

2126
02:03:31,704 --> 02:03:35,367
Let me something,
do you want to spend your life with..

2127
02:03:35,674 --> 02:03:37,835
..my daughter or your grandfather?

2128
02:03:40,579 --> 02:03:42,444
You will have to leave one of them.

2129
02:03:42,882 --> 02:03:45,942
Either my daughter
or your grandfather.

2130
02:03:51,757 --> 02:03:52,951
Kala..

2131
02:04:01,667 --> 02:04:04,465
One cannot send the moon back
to the sky for everyone, Alisha.

2132
02:04:06,839 --> 02:04:08,363
l love you alot.

2133
02:04:09,642 --> 02:04:11,371
l cannot live without you.

2134
02:04:16,982 --> 02:04:18,779
But l cannot leave my grandfather.

2135
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:25,883
''Where does the road
meet the horizon?''

2136
02:04:26,859 --> 02:04:32,297
''Everyone knows that.''

2137
02:04:32,398 --> 02:04:41,397
''Where do they part, who knows?''

2138
02:04:41,574 --> 02:04:42,905
Kala..

2139
02:04:47,313 --> 02:04:50,749
''You don't know..''

2140
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:54,684
''You don't value..''

2141
02:04:54,787 --> 02:05:02,592

''The tears l shed for you.''

2143
02:05:05,998 --> 02:05:09,900
''Only l or my heart knows.''

2144
02:05:10,002 --> 02:05:14,632
''Only l or my heart knows.''

2145
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:18,335
''You don't know..''

2146
02:05:18,444 --> 02:05:22,972
''You don't value..''

2147
02:05:43,802 --> 02:05:48,000
''l feel that..''

2148
02:05:48,307 --> 02:05:51,708
''By staying away from you..''

2149
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:55,673
''My heart keep tearing apart..''

2150
02:05:55,781 --> 02:05:59,615
''Enduring the pain of love.''

2151
02:06:01,887 --> 02:06:05,516
''l feel that..''

2152
02:06:05,624 --> 02:06:09,424
''By staying away from you..''

''My heart keep tearing apart..''

2154
02:06:13,966 --> 02:06:17,424
''Enduring the pain oflove.''

2155
02:06:17,703 --> 02:06:21,366
''Enduring the pain oflove.''

2156
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:29,006
''Staying away from you, l feel dead.''

2157
02:06:29,315 --> 02:06:36,812
''All the tears l shed for you.''

2158
02:06:36,922 --> 02:06:40,585
''The tears l shed for you.''

2159
02:06:40,693 --> 02:06:44,720

Give him the gifts.

He has been to Canada as well.

2167
02:07:27,906 --> 02:07:30,500
This is what every one wanted, right?

2168
02:07:30,576 --> 02:07:32,635
Yes, this is what we wanted.

2169
02:07:32,845 --> 02:07:35,370
Kato, do you give your consent?

2170
02:07:35,547 --> 02:07:38,311
Don't object it like you did earlier.

Yes, father. l give my consent.

2172

Both of them have given their consent
and both of them like each other.

02:07:47,626 --> 02:07:50,390
Okay then, continue with the custom.

What are you doing over here?

Actually when you were coming here..

2188

l don't know whether he
saved my life when we were young..

2189
02:08:53,892 --> 02:08:54,824
..but Saktiman did surely save me now.

2190
02:08:57,062 --> 02:08:59,360
Kale, come back.
- Coming.

2191
02:08:59,932 --> 02:09:00,728

2198
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:22,652
Mann sahib..

2199
02:09:23,789 --> 02:09:25,723

Aren't you my brother?

Get lost!

2204
02:09:38,337 --> 02:09:39,770

No means no.Just yes.

Kato! Why? l love you a lot!

2207
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:49,847
l was the one who fed you snacks.

2208
02:09:49,948 --> 02:09:51,609
And when it was turn to give sweets,
you went for Kala!

2209
02:09:51,717 --> 02:09:52,809
Why, Kato?

2210
02:09:52,918 --> 02:09:54,977
Why, Kato? - Hey!

2211
02:10:04,296 --> 02:10:09,427
My fields are tended to, daily.

2212
02:10:09,701 --> 02:10:14,729
The grandsons thought to be
useless are the ones who are useful.

2213
02:10:15,007 --> 02:10:17,475
Grandpa, this is not right.

2214
02:10:17,976 --> 02:10:20,911
We went so far and you
left your grandson there.

2215
02:10:21,013 --> 02:10:22,310
You didn't hit Albert.

2216
02:10:22,514 --> 02:10:24,379
What is this, grandpa?
You ruined everything.

2217
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:28,351
lf l'm served cold okra
at home l'll throw the plate away.

2218
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:29,751
Stop blabbering.

2219
02:10:29,988 --> 02:10:32,354
Grandpa, she has just come.
Let us settle down.

2220
02:10:32,457 --> 02:10:33,481
She has just come.

2221
02:10:35,594 --> 02:10:38,893
And l was saying,
isn't Canada beautiful?

2222
02:10:41,033 --> 02:10:41,931
Yes, itis.

l say, why don't all of us..
all of us go and stayin Canada?

You are following your
wife's orders already?.

2225
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:54,702
lf you don't stop talking
then l'll have you both boxed-in.

2226
02:10:54,813 --> 02:10:58,408
You are very eager to go to Canada!

2227

Wait, l'll send you to Canada!
- No, grandpa!

2228
02:11:03,956 --> 02:11:07,653
You want to go to Canada!- Don't hit me. l'll
get hurt. Then you can have the okra all by yourself.

2229
02:11:07,759 --> 02:11:07,826

- l'll teach you a lesson.
- Who wants you there! You want to go to Canada.
