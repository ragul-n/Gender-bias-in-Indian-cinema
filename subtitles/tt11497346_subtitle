1
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:54,084
A breaking news

2
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,292
Popular litterateur 
Sri Lakshminarayana Malgudi,

3
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:03,124
has announced his retirement to his writing.

4
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,416
This must be for the first time a litterateur,

5
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,292
announcing the retirement in litterary field.

6
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,168
For past 40 years,

7
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:24,208
our publication house was printing his works.

8
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,792
If not for him,

9
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,832
at least for his readers,

10
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,460
should continue his writing.

11
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:33,876
This is our wish.

12
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,668
Dad, where are you going?

13
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,832
We are leaving to America tonight

14
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:01,916
The major works of Lakshminaraya, includes

15
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,040
MARADA NERALU 
(Shadow of the tree)

16
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:04,168
DEVAANGI

17
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,252
AMMANONDIGE 
(With my mother)

18
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,124
NAANALIDA MELE 
(After my death), etc.,

19
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,040
But,

20
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:12,752
the reason behind his sudden decision is not known yet.

21
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,124
When our readers appreciate our work

22
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:40,624
we get motivated to write more

23
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,916
However, I feel that the present generation

24
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,708
doesn't like my writing, that much

25
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:55,040
Give a second thought to your decision.

26
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,040
Currently this is how I feel.

27
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,168
But if a situation where I have to write arises,

28
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,168
then I’ll see what to do

29
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,792
Yakshagana is a sight to behold, right?

30
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:35,332
Super!

31
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,332
Instead of working in office hours, 
what are you doing here?

32
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,000
Sluggish Idiots!

33
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,292
Go, go, mind your business, bastard

34
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,040
What?

35
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:50,584
What did he say?

36
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:51,124
Nothing sir

37
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:51,792
No, no no..

38
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,252
He said something like ‘poya’, ‘poya’

39
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:56,416
He was complimenting your outfit sir, right?

40
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:56,960
Yes, yes

41
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,416
Listen, don’t use regional language here

42
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:00,752
Okay 
- Okay sir

43
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:01,500
Go work

44
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,792
You bloody…

45
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:03,876
Good morning.

46
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:04,460
Come now

47
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:15,040
Why are you late?

48
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:17,332
You stay in a PG

49
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,960
You are provided with all facilities

50
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:22,540
People like us who live by ourselves, 
know what our difficulty is.

51
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:25,208
That’s why I asked you to get a roommate

52
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:26,752
Roommate?

53
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,416
No thanks! I’m doing fine on my own.

54
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,040
Prakruthi..

55
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,252
Boss wants to see you.

56
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,500
Now, he is going to take me to task!

57
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:41,792
That's it.

58
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:43,332
Excuse me sir?

59
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:46,960
I’ll call you back

60
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:50,876
Ms Prakruthi, come on, have a seat

61
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:53,624
Why late?

62
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,832
I didn’t hear the alarm ring

63
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,832
But still I got ready fast.

64
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:01,916
But I got stuck in traffic!

65
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,252
I can understand

66
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,084
Bangalore traffic is horrible. right?

67
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:10,668
And Prakruthi,

68
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,540
One good news

69
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,916
The All India IT conference is happening in Goa

70
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:18,124
So,

71
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:22,332
You will be representing our company there

72
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,460
We two will be going..

73
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,168
So, be prepared for that.

74
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:32,708
Sir, I can’t come

75
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,668
I’m going to my hometown next week

76
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,208
I will be taking off for four days

77
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:39,084
I have already applied for leave

78
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:40,500
Listen

79
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,252
What will you go home and do?

80
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,876
You’ll kill time chit chatting

81
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,584
At least participating in such national conferences 
will get you more reputation.

82
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,416
It will help you progress in your career faster.

83
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,540
Got it?

84
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,416
It’s been six months since I’ve gone home. 
I have to go

85
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,208
Please

86
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,584
Okay

87
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:13,168
Think of it.

88
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:14,376
Company

89
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:15,708
Salary

90
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,460
or family..

91
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:23,376
Okay sir, thank you

92
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:30,124
What happened?

93
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:31,460
Asshole!

94
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,752
Conference in Goa it seems, 
I only have to go it seems! What the…

95
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,168
Give a second thought to your decision

96
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:45,540
After giving it much thought only 
I have taken this decision

97
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,708
`Koneya Tiruvu' 
(Last Turn)

98
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:49,832
…that’s my last book

99
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,752
What inspires you to write?

100
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,000
According to me, 
these two can write very well.

101
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,584
One, who has experienced poverty,

102
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,084
The other,

103
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:05,000
who knows what it means to go hungry

104
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,332
Lakshminarayana Malgudi,

105
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,668
Can you tell us about your birth place?

106
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:13,792
Malgudi..

107
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,916
This is where I was born and brought up.

108
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,752
I was in Malgudi, till my 16.

109
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,040
Then I moved to Bengaluru

110
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,960
Have you never visited Malgudi since you came here?

111
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,332
Somehow, after coming to Bengaluru,

112
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,876
no such opportunity presented itself 
for me to go to Malgudi.

113
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:38,376
We will take a break and be right back

114
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:43,376
You are coming home next Friday right?

115
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,584
I have applied for leave,

116
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:46,708
if it gets approved, I’ll come,

117
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:47,540
otherwise no.

118
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,124
You are 28 years of age.

119
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,752
It’s high time you get married.

120
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,916
That astrologer says

121
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,040
there is some dosha in your horoscope.

122
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:57,752
to set it right,

123
00:11:57,832 --> 00:11:59,332
you say, you are not coming.

124
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,084
Mom, I’ll come okay?

125
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:02,832
You were complaining of headache.

126
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:06,416
You are taking oil headbath 
atleast once in a week. isn't it ?

127
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:08,876
Yes I am!

128
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,708
Also don’t eat junk food outside.

129
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:12,708
Fine

130
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,292
Sleep well.

131
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,084
Avoid using your mobile phone for long hours.

132
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,040
Okay

133
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:21,584
And remember that alliance 
from America, that boy…

134
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:24,208
Mom, I’m getting a call from office , 
bye bye…

135
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,960
In your eyes filled with desire

136
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:45,752
Let only your goals be visible

137
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:50,792
In your eyes filled with desire

138
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:56,084
Let only your goals be visible

139
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,876
Come and spread laughter

140
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:05,584
Life is like a teaser

141
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:10,460
If you forget agony

142
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:15,376
Every moment will be fresh

143
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,708
Walk as equal

144
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,084
Bitter and sweet alike

145
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:24,668
It is fun to win by sweating out

146
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,916
Close to goodness

147
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,124
Protesting the evil

148
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,252
Strive sans rest

149
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,416
Be a blooming flower

150
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,668
Be a rain drop

151
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:43,332
Be a spark of fire

152
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:45,668
Be the sunlight

153
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,040
Be the brightness of moon

154
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,876
Be the twinkling star.

155
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,832
desire..

156
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:55,832
Hi, Prakruthi

157
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,792
I need two cans of beer to wash my hair

158
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,708
I’ll be at Raksha’s house. Get it.

159
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:01,168
Hair wash???

160
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,332
Cheers

161
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:23,500
We are second to none

162
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,792
Do not neglect us as we are women

163
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,376
Woman is the strength behind achievers

164
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,540
If a woman sits idle 
one should eat nothing but dust

165
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:33,000
There is no dearth of prowess or wile

166
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,292
If we stand determined 
Man will be dummy

167
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,540
Strongest are the hands that rock cradle

168
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:40,332
Those who wrong us will be hit hard

169
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:45,584
Without you

170
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,960
memory is lifeless

171
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,208
Even in this silence

172
00:14:55,624 --> 00:15:00,792
Only your voice is heard

173
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:05,500
Every day I go in search of

174
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:10,000
Your dream path

175
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,624
Bring back life

176
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:19,668
Merging your breath with mine

177
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Life is a teaser 
Which gives laughter

178
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:33,752
If you forget agony

179
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:38,500
Every moment will be fresh

180
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:43,252
In your eyes filled with desire

181
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:47,832
Let only your goals be visible

182
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,832
In your eyes filled with desire

183
00:15:52,708 --> 00:16:00,084
Let only your goals be visible

184
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,124
What are you doing?

185
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,832
I’m reading

186
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,584
I was just checking on you, as you were silent

187
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,460
Do you need any help in the kitchen?

188
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,668
No I’ll manage

189
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:22,252
Okay

190
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:28,460
Saroja, what happened?

191
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:33,124
Saroja

192
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,540
Saroja

193
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:38,708
Saroja, what happened?

194
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,376
Wake up

195
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,040
Saroja

196
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:43,708
Oh God!

197
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:45,832
Hello

198
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,460
I told you several times,

199
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,084
to marry our daughter off to 
someone who stays in our city

200
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,040
You never listened to me.

201
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:20,916
But you found a boy who stays in America!

202
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:22,460
See,

203
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,040
she could not even make it to my funeral

204
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,500
Now it’s just you and her

205
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,832
MARADA NERALU 
(shadow of the tree)

206
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,252
Here, have some coffee

207
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:15,540
Why are you looking at me like that? 
Take it

208
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,916
Don’t worry, it’s sugarless. Drink it

209
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,960
Dad, we will feel at ease, 
if you come with us

210
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:46,752
But I too should be okay for it, know?

211
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:50,624
From the place to people, 
everything will be new to me

212
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:52,624
I am not coming,

213
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,292
Grandpa, please come with us.

214
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,500
If you don’t come, we also won’t go

215
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,960
Grandpa, please come

216
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,252
What about your school?

217
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:04,168
We don’t know all that.

218
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,332
You have to come, please

219
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,708
Should I now?

220
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:13,708
Okay!

221
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,252
When to go?

222
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
Your visa is ready.

223
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,376
I will book the tickets within two days

224
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,708
Hey, Prakruthi, why?

225
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:46,332
Why are you so late?

226
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:49,000
Today she came to office at 12 pm!

227
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,668
But who will question her??

228
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,876
Who asks the girls, 
if they come late? sympathy..!

229
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,416
Prakruthi, boss is want's to see you

230
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,584
I won’t go there,

231
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,832
ask him to come here

232
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,252
What do you think?

233
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,960
What do you think of yourself?

234
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:15,416
This is too much Prakruthi

235
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:17,752
You are crossing your limits

236
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,960
I’ll dismiss you

237
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,752
Please

238
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,832
Kindly do that,

239
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:29,960
Mr Rajvardhan!

240
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,376
How dare you to call by my name?

241
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,084
Give respect to your M.D.!

242
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,960
To get respect one must be worthy of it.

243
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,040
You are not.

244
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:41,708
You were telling about dismiss.?

245
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,460
I’ll only resign!.

246
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:48,500
I don’t work in this company anymore.

247
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:49,252
What?

248
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,416
What nonsense are you 
talking Prakruthi?

249
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:53,752
Think twice.

250
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,668
You won’t get this job profile elsewhere.

251
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,752
Nor you will get such a work atmosphere.

252
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,792
That is true.

253
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:03,792
Neither will I get an atmosphere like this,

254
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,792
nor a shameless boss like you anywhere!

255
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,752
Hey! Mind your language.

256
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,540
What do you think we girls are?

257
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:15,540
Guys, listen here!

258
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,876
This third class boss of yours,

259
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,752
It seems there is IT conference in Goa.,

260
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:23,960
and he invites me alone to go with him.

261
00:21:24,332 --> 00:21:25,416
In spite of my refusal,

262
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,252
he has been harassing me 
since two weeks, to go with him.

263
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:30,752
There are so many seniors in this office.

264
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,040
and yet he wants me only to go with him.

265
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:33,960
Look,

266
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,708
You got me wrong. 
This is all rubbish you are ta…

267
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,416
Shhh!!!…There is more.

268
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:45,376
Last time he took Vinusha along 
for Delhi conference,

269
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,624
harassed her there.

270
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,876
She got scared and left the office

271
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:51,376
Listen,

272
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,500
she quit citing personal reasons.

273
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:55,792
Look Mister,

274
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,168
I have messages 
that you have sent me from a year ago

275
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:00,500
`Let’s go to a resort'

276
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,376
`Let us go on a long drive'

277
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,708
`I can’t sleep, send me that type selfie'

278
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,168
Listen carefully.

279
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,460
I’m submitting my resignation

280
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,208
My last two-month salary 
should be credited by today evening.

281
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,708
If not ...

282
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,416
I’ll put molestation case, 
and have you put behind the bars.

283
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:26,168
Good bye for your job!

284
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:32,916
And..and

285
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:38,084
I have the screen shots of all the messages, 
which you sent to Vinusha and me,

286
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,752
and I have forwarded to your wife,

287
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:40,876
Have a good day.

288
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:44,084
Stop!

289
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,168
You should not get a job in any company..

290
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:54,876
I will make sure.

291
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,792
Bloody bitch.

292
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,252
We are still slogging here!

293
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:18,000
Where did she got that courage from?

294
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:20,208
Mostly it must be #Me Too affect.

295
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,832
She loved my writing, 
loved me and married me.

296
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,792
I stopped writing.

297
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,208
She too left me!

298
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,500
I used to tell her,

299
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,084
`Saroja…

300
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,792
… I will die before you..

301
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:46,292
because, I don't have the power to live without you.'

302
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,624
But she only passed away first.

303
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:53,832
But the truth is,

304
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,208
if she would have been in my situation,

305
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:02,168
she would not have the strength to endure this distress.

306
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:03,960
Friend,

307
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:06,916
Friend, Call me often, 
once you are in America.

308
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,252
GOVT. HIGH SCHOOL 
MALGUDI

309
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,708
Is he not a renowned litterateur now? 
I doubt if he will even remember us

310
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,252
You needed us when we were in school, 
but you don't need us now, isn't it?

311
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:48,876
“Flowers don’t talk.. 
When they bloom, everybody admires

312
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:54,668
Water does not speak 
If it falls from atop, everybody rejoices

313
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,876
The wind does not talk...

314
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,252
I’m so sorry

315
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:27,252
Are you fine?

316
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:29,916
That’s okay

317
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,500
Are you hurt? 
No..no

318
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:34,708
You came suddenly, so I didn’t notice 
Doesn't matter

319
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:36,624
You are fine, right?

320
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:37,208
I’m alright.

321
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,500
I should have been more careful. 
It was my fault.

322
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:41,292
It was my fault too

323
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:42,584
Don't worry, give me the bag.

324
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,252
It is fine, it is okay.

325
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,376
Should I drop you somewhere?

326
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:47,792
No, I don’t want to trouble you. 
Please, I insist sir

327
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,292
Ya, please

328
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,668
I was heading towards Majestic

329
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:55,168
Ya, sure. I’ll get this

330
00:27:55,668 --> 00:27:56,960
Okay, okay

331
00:28:01,168 --> 00:28:03,792
Sir, where are you off to this early?

332
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,252
I don’t know

333
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,332
Sorry?

334
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,832
I have not decided yet.

335
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,460
I have left home and come

336
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,876
Why? Are your children not taking 
good care of you?

337
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:25,000
Or is it Love case?

338
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,040
Nothing like that

339
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:36,252
Last week I lost my wife

340
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,540
I’m alone at home

341
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:43,168
My daughter and son-in-law have come from America

342
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,916
They are insisting to go with them to America.

343
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,792
I don't want to go to America.

344
00:28:53,124 --> 00:28:55,540
Since I’ll be forced to go with them 
if I stay there,

345
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,168
I left home and came

346
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:02,376
Mine too is a sort of similar story

347
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:05,752
I was fed up of my boss and work issues

348
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,500
I desperately needed a break

349
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:11,168
So I borrowed my friend’s car and started out

350
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,084
Where to?

351
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,708
Same pinch, No clue

352
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:20,208
Mostly towards Malnad region, I think..

353
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:22,040
Alone?

354
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,208
Oh!

355
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,792
You don’t know where are you going, isn't it?

356
00:29:31,332 --> 00:29:35,792
So if you have no objection, 
you too can come with me.

357
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,752
I’ll also have company

358
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,876
But you’ll have to sponsor our food

359
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,292
I’ll take care of the fuel

360
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,752
Okay, will give..

361
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,668
Anyway, you wanted to go towards Malnad..

362
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,000
Can we go to Malgudi?

363
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,540
Malgudi?

364
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,416
Yes, Malgudi,

365
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,708
I was born there

366
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
It’s been ages since I went there

367
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:11,624
Now I’m feeling like going there

368
00:30:12,832 --> 00:30:14,124
So I asked, that's it.

369
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,584
Okay

370
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,460
Sir,

371
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,960
until you introduced yourself,

372
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,916
I didn’t realize you are 
the litterateur 
Lakshminarayana Malgudi

373
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:35,000
That’s okay.

374
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,124
Am I film hero, 
to recognize me at first sight?

375
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,416
Aren't the writers also heros?

376
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:44,708
This is very tasty

377
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:48,540
It’s not too sugary.. It’s yummy

378
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:52,332
I’m a foodie

379
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:56,500
Especially if I get local delicacies,

380
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:57,960
eat more..

381
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:02,040
Our work tensions, 
made us to forget eating.

382
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:06,540
If Whatsapp and Facebook were edible,

383
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,084
then you would eat till your stomach burst I suppose!

384
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:12,500
Sir, we are youths,

385
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,792
Should always be in trending..

386
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:17,960
It’s these trends that are making writers like us jobless!

387
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,584
See there,

388
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,124
everyone is busy reading messages,

389
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,624
no one wants to read books!

390
00:31:26,624 --> 00:31:28,084
You know what sir,

391
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:31,960
earlier we had to fall back 
on books 
and news for information

392
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,668
Now you get everything in Google !

393
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:35,708
You get everything..

394
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,376
but for the people we have lost!

395
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,000
But we can see what we have lost also,

396
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,708
which is a kind of torturous

397
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,792
Can we leave?

398
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,708
I feel like watching the sunrise

399
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,084
It’s been a while since I have seen one too.

400
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:05,668
Let’s go

401
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:22,292
When darkness recedes

402
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:31,252
Amazement of earth twinkles

403
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:38,792
The world looks new

404
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,876
Bringing out the child in you

405
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:54,668
It is re-birth to the lifeless heart

406
00:32:54,916 --> 00:33:01,252
Sunrise

407
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,500
As if a town is beckoning you

408
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:28,416
As if something is left behind

409
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:34,168
The path is conducive

410
00:33:34,752 --> 00:33:39,540
The firstlight is colourful

411
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:46,708
In the dew filled dawn

412
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,792
Let moments blossom

413
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:58,876
amidst memories

414
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,416
Let the journey go on

415
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:10,252
The air of the earthy scent

416
00:34:10,376 --> 00:34:15,752
touches gracefully..

417
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,252
A line of poems of past

418
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:29,916
have become songs now

419
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,000
I’m really sorry

420
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,416
I don't like America..

421
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:37,292
I’ll be back in Bangalore in two days

422
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:38,460
It’s not like that, Daddy

423
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,292
You please leave

424
00:34:40,624 --> 00:34:42,460
Apologise on my behalf to the kids

425
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:57,416
Those written stories

426
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:03,040
have sought the town’s skies

427
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:09,332
The hidden tears

428
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:15,460
desire a space filled with love

429
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:19,084
The tree that embraces the earth,

430
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:22,000
is saying something,

431
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:27,752
`Come what may, keep growing like this'..

432
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,960
Like the silence of the forest, 
turned into a song

433
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,252
and brought the rain

434
00:35:33,252 --> 00:35:40,916
The way to the town is also inviting

435
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:51,040
The tree that embraces the earth,

436
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:53,708
is saying something,

437
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,460
`Come what may, keep growing like this'..

438
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,708
As if a town is beckoning you

439
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:11,124
As if something is left behind

440
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,332
The path is conducive

441
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,460
The firstlight is colourful

442
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:29,916
In the dew filled dawn

443
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,832
Let moments blossom*

444
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,208
aye, aye.. 
- what?

445
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,792
She is on a tour with some old man..!

446
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,668
The picture says, ‘journey begins’

447
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:14,792
Phew, here we are, waste bodies..

448
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:19,252
could not impress a single girl..girl!

449
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:24,584
It seems girls like old men more, what you say?

450
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,960
In that case, let we also age faster!

451
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,540
Sir,

452
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,792
I have read a couple of your books

453
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,124
`MARADA NERALU' (Shadow of the tree) 
is my favourite

454
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,376
Oh! Really?

455
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:42,168
At the end of the story,

456
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:46,708
the daughter's agony, when she could not attend 
the last rites of her mother,

457
00:37:46,752 --> 00:37:48,332
the attachment of father and daughter,

458
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,040
the way you described it..

459
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,460
had tears when I read it..

460
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:56,124
Sometimes imagination becomes reality

461
00:37:57,332 --> 00:38:00,416
As a writer, I also like that work of mine

462
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:02,916
After reading that book,

463
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:06,624
I wished I had a father too

464
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,084
You mean, your father is no more, is it?

465
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:13,208
My father passed away when I was in school

466
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:19,624
A father’s love,

467
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,208
daughter’s warmth,

468
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:22,460
mother’s tenderness,

469
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:24,084
wife’s concern…

470
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:27,876
Only those who have experienced all these 
can realize the value of it

471
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,416
What does your mother do?

472
00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:33,084
She is a homemaker

473
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:35,668
Right now she is worried about 
only one thing

474
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,832
The fact that I remain unmarried 
even at this age

475
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,460
But I am telling, 
why get married at such a young age??

476
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,292
Certain things have to happen 
at certain times,

477
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,208
only then will they be meaningful.

478
00:38:51,252 --> 00:38:55,040
More so in the case of girls,

479
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,708
While working in the IT sector,

480
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,124
did you like someone? Any proposals …

481
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:03,084
Lots, but somehow I didn’t like..

482
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:07,000
I think this, Love, affection are all bullshit..

483
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:08,792
Which means,

484
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:12,084
you loved and lost in love,

485
00:39:12,624 --> 00:39:14,416
and are now in the ‘I hate him’ mode!.

486
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:18,752
My story too

487
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:21,000
Writers,

488
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:23,208
not only in writing stories,

489
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,876
interested in hearing the stories too..

490
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,000
Tell me your story. I'll listen.

491
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:30,960
We can pass the time till we reach Malgudi

492
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:35,208
Oh! So my love story is your time pass, is it??

493
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,040
If it upsets you..

494
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,000
That’s okay, I’ll tell you..

495
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,168
I am born and brought up at Sringeri.

496
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,416
Completed my BCA degree.

497
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:46,668
Got a job in campus selection.

498
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,292
That was in Puducherry

499
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:51,252
I had never stepped out of Malnad region before.

500
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:53,668
So I was very scared

501
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,916
I, especially can’t forget the first day

502
00:39:57,252 --> 00:39:58,376
Why, what had happened?

503
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:02,084
New people, new place, new language

504
00:40:10,376 --> 00:40:11,916
I was really scared

505
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:16,000
That was when I saw Vijay for the first time

506
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:23,040
If somebody asks a girl 
how her man should be,

507
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:26,040
`like Vijay' would be the answer. 
Such a smart fellow, he was.

508
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:27,332
He was smart fellow.

509
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:30,292
He made me to cry on my very first day

510
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,376
Hey, I’ll be back

511
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:34,252
Good Morning 
- Good morning.

512
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,084
Hey, sit, sit, sit

513
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:39,500
Hi, myself Vijay, I am your trainer.

514
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,292
I’ll be training you for the next 15 days

515
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:44,000
And very importantly,

516
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,624
Welcome to the corporate world!. 
- Thank you sir.

517
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:47,668
What I would like to say is,

518
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,624
corporate world is totally different 
from your college life

519
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,292
Nobody to help you all, all right

520
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:52,916
Please introduce yourselves

521
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,960

00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,124

Nobody is going to punish you!

535
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:29,252
My name is Prakruthi

536
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:32,916
I came from Karnataka

537
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:34,168
Karnataka?

538
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,208
Nice

539
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,752
BCA, 80% marks

540
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:41,292
Okay Prakruti, 
tell me something..

541
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,876
What do you know about this company?

542
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:47,584
It is big company,

543
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:53,040
I love to work here

544
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:55,792
It is good company.

545
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,000
What is this Prakruthi?

546
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:01,416
You have come to join this company,

547
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,124
and you don’t know the basic things 
about this company?

548
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,832
Seriously?

549
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:06,708
Shame on you

550
00:42:13,376 --> 00:42:14,540
Why are you crying?

551
00:42:16,252 --> 00:42:17,000
Don’t cry

552
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:20,876
Don’t cry

553
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,252
I didn’t shout at you

554
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,040
I just made an observation

555
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,960
You can speak Kannada?

556
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,124
Then why didn’t you ask me in Kannada?

557
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,752
See, we have to converse only in English in the company.

558
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:36,460
That is our company rules

559
00:42:36,752 --> 00:42:38,668
You mean to say that 
only those who know English will be respected?

560
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:39,832
It’s not like that

561
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:42,416
Then, only thse who know English are intelligent..

562
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,540
I’ have studied in Kannada medium

563
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:47,668
I am not fluent in English

564
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:48,832
I will learn

565
00:42:50,124 --> 00:42:52,540
Please don’t insult me 
because I don't know the language.

566
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:53,960
Just calm down

567
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,460
This is a multinational company

568
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:59,000
For business we have to talk in English

569
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:00,332
That’s what I was trying to tell.

570
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,292
Now you please don't cry, okay?

571
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,460
You just calm down..

572
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,752
sit sown, come

573
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:22,832
You know why I came here?

574
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,584
I just wanted to listen a beautiful poem from you.

575
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:26,960
Can you sing a poem?

576
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,752
Tell me ya, tell me some poem,

577
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,668
`Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are …'

578
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,708
Tell me that one line..

579
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,124
just a single line

580
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:43,084
Aye, come on yaar, 
Why are you making fun of her?

581
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,752
She doesn't know English only.

582
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,792
What’s going on?

583
00:43:46,252 --> 00:43:48,084
Dude, trainer..

584
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,124
If this happens again, you’ll be fired. 
- - No sir, no. Sorry sir, sorry.

585
00:43:56,252 --> 00:43:57,124
Come, come..

586
00:44:00,832 --> 00:44:02,292
Why are you crying?

587
00:44:03,376 --> 00:44:04,832
I’ll go back

588
00:44:05,752 --> 00:44:07,832
I’m not able to adjust to this place

589
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:11,208
Everyone looks down upon me

590
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,168
Listen

591
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,332
Not knowing English is not your problem,

592
00:44:17,832 --> 00:44:19,584
Lack of confidence is your problem.

593
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:21,668
Build that confidence.

594
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,292
Be bold

595
00:44:23,624 --> 00:44:24,960
I will tell you something

596
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:26,916
Everybody is equal here

597
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,500
Why are you comparing yourself to them?

598
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:31,668
Don’t do that

599
00:44:33,832 --> 00:44:36,252
And listen, this will never happen hereafter.

600
00:44:36,584 --> 00:44:37,792
Because I have warned them

601
00:44:38,252 --> 00:44:39,792
Happy?

602
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:45,208
Listen,

603
00:44:46,252 --> 00:44:48,792
Nothing is more beautiful 
than a confident woman,

604
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:52,832
who does not pretend to be something she is not.

605
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,332
Okay?

606
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:10,376
That word changed my whole life..

607
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,916
Without my knowing, 
I was attracted by him.

608
00:45:28,752 --> 00:45:32,540
My dream girl is right in front of me

609
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:37,668
I can't help but stare at her like a child

610
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:41,540
Our acquaintance transformed into love

611
00:45:42,168 --> 00:45:45,624
I matched my every step along with hers

612
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:50,000
Love took over me as

613
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:54,624
I lost my heart to her

614
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:59,500
Resonating a new song

615
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:03,500
And nothing but you remain my focus

616
00:46:04,252 --> 00:46:13,252
You are now part of me, a part of me

617
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:22,332
I am now a part of you, part of you

618
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:33,960
Your laughter, your eyes..

619
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,876
This journey, has unknowingly begun

620
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:38,168
Why need a reason to smile..

621
00:46:38,168 --> 00:46:40,668
This life is in full of your thoughts

622
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,876
Wherever I go, you come in front of me..

623
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:49,668
Whatever I do, you are settled in my heart

624
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,792
like the cool breeze

625
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,124
you have touched me

626
00:46:58,832 --> 00:47:08,292
There is nothing other than you on my mind

627
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,252
You are the rain and I am the greenery

628
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:19,208
It is dawn of love now on..

629
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:23,292
You are the lyrics and I am the tune

630
00:47:23,332 --> 00:47:27,792
Don't we have melodious future?

631
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:31,960
Oh my love, Come now

632
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,252
Oh my love,

633
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,960
Come now

634
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,460
Closeness is dear

635
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,960
Proximity gives freedom

636
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:52,292
As the heart slopes, it is only your thoughts

637
00:47:52,624 --> 00:47:55,000
Come pamper me

638
00:47:55,084 --> 00:47:58,916
I will hold your little finger, extend it

639
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:01,416
Will walk along..

640
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,332
Love me..

641
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:32,208
In that one year I spent with him,

642
00:48:32,252 --> 00:48:34,416
I went through an unbelievable transformation!

643
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:39,332
Without me knowing it, I started loving him.

644
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:43,292
It is it.

645
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,292
If we understand someone so well,

646
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,876
that is love.

647
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:52,252
Anyway, who proposed first?

648
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:56,040
I wanted to propose

649
00:48:56,332 --> 00:48:58,460
I had planned to surprise him too

650
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:11,960
This birthday is very special for me

651
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:15,168
This is something which I will remember for lifetime

652
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,624
Really, thank you so much for making it so special

653
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:20,000
My pleasure

654
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:28,960
You have changed a lot, 
since I saw you first time, and today.

655
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,040
Nice

656
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,460
I was alone in my life.

657
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:38,000
After you entered my life,

658
00:49:39,832 --> 00:49:41,084
it has changed so much

659
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,168
Shringeri girl has gone all modern!

660
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:54,960
I’m talking to you and you are glued to your phone

661
00:49:55,376 --> 00:49:56,416
It’s not fair ya.

662
00:49:57,124 --> 00:49:59,040
I’m listening, to you. tell..

663
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,332
When I’m talking,

664
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,792
concentration should be here.

665
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,960
Or else I’ll get angry

666
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,792
Vijay, give back my phone.

667
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:13,084
Is this phone more important than me?

668
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:18,460
I was googling, not chatting

669
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,584
Don't make me angry, give back my phone

670
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:25,168
You can also get angry is it?

671
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,668
Don’t try to start a fight

672
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,540
Just give my phone back

673
00:50:33,252 --> 00:50:35,708
Am I important, or the phone?

674
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,500
Phone

675
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,252
Listen

676
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:48,792
You have changed a lot

677
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:51,376
A lot!

678
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:53,960
What’s your problem man?

679
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:58,876
You are always asking me, don't do this, 
do that, don't be like this, like that..

680
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:01,708
It’s my personal life

681
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:03,960
I will lead it the way I want to

682
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:06,584
Don’t interfere, I don’t like it. Okay?

683
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:09,960
Listen

684
00:51:11,876 --> 00:51:13,460
I’m not an outsider,

685
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,292
I have that right

686
00:51:17,584 --> 00:51:19,876
Okay, let’s get this straight

687
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,624
Just because you have the right,

688
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:25,708
I can’t live the way you want me to, okay?

689
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:28,708
I too have a comfort zone, don’t cross that

690
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,708
Comfort zone?

691
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:31,416
Yes!

692
00:51:32,416 --> 00:51:36,084
From where this comfort zone came, 
which was not there till now?

693
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:40,252
Now I get it.

694
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:43,208
May be you have a new friend,

695
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,540
so, you forgot the old friend, know?

696
00:51:45,584 --> 00:51:46,124
Vijay

697
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,252
I never thought you can think so cheaply..

698
00:51:53,124 --> 00:51:56,000
Thank You for everything, Good bye.

699
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,752
We had break up on proposal day itself.

700
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,668
After that I left Puducherry and moved to Bengaluru

701
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,540
Ever since life has been good

702
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,916
But that was the last time I spoke to him.

703
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:36,916
This is hilarious

704
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:43,416
Why?

705
00:52:44,668 --> 00:52:47,084
You have lost your love without any reason, 
that's why!

706
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,208
See,

707
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,584
without problems

708
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,040
no relationship will strengthen

709
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:57,876
We should learn to tactfully cop up with such issues

710
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,792
Relationships and problems around them are like,

711
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:04,792
jackfruit and the rough skin around it

712
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:10,752
Just because the skin is tough and poky, 
is not the fruit tasty?

713
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:15,832
What is it we want?

714
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:16,916
Fruit

715
00:53:17,752 --> 00:53:18,540
its fragrance,

716
00:53:19,252 --> 00:53:20,416
its taste..

717
00:53:21,084 --> 00:53:21,792
means..

718
00:53:22,752 --> 00:53:24,624
Goodness..isn't it?

719
00:53:26,668 --> 00:53:28,540
Did he not try to reach out to you?

720
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,792
He did several times

721
00:53:32,832 --> 00:53:34,208
I have not received calls

722
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:36,916
I did feel like talking,

723
00:53:38,168 --> 00:53:40,124
but my conscience did not permit me.

724
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:42,168
At times,

725
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,040
We would have shared so many things with them 
who are close to our heart.

726
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:49,668
But when situations have drawn us apart,

727
00:53:50,124 --> 00:53:52,416
and live, thinking them as our rivals, afterwards.

728
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,124
In spite of all this,

729
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,792
we will continue to have 
a soft corner for them.

730
00:54:02,668 --> 00:54:03,540
True sir..

731
00:54:04,124 --> 00:54:05,416
Many a times I have felt that,

732
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,332
it would be nice if I could share 
my happiness and sorrow with him.

733
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:15,916
I feel, stirring your old memories..

734
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,584
curdled your emotions..

735
00:54:19,332 --> 00:54:21,500
I have never shared this with anyone.

736
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,668
I feel relieved sharing it with you.

737
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,792
Hey, Bro!

738
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,416
Where are you off to?

739
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,584
Who is that man with you?

740
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:38,084
He is Lakshminarayana Malgudi, 
a litterateur

741
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:39,208
Met him on the way.

742
00:54:39,332 --> 00:54:40,916
I’ll tell you everything, after returning. 
Don’t ask me anything now.

743
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,124
Why not? Tell me now itself.

744
00:54:42,124 --> 00:54:43,168
Bye, bye byeeeeeee!

745
00:54:53,376 --> 00:54:53,876
Sir,

746
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:58,252
there must be strong reason 
for you not visiting your hometown so long.

747
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,624
Reasons are many.

748
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:02,208
In that age,

749
00:55:03,084 --> 00:55:06,668
I didn’t had the discretion 
what is right and what is wrong

750
00:55:08,252 --> 00:55:09,208
Apart from that,

751
00:55:10,668 --> 00:55:12,500
hiding my hometown,

752
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:14,540
Bengaluru engulfed me

753
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:18,708
Then what made you to think of 
seeing hometown now suddenly?

754
00:55:19,752 --> 00:55:25,540
Do you know, which is our life's paramount, 
and ever remembering chapter?

755
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:26,332
Which ones?

756
00:55:28,252 --> 00:55:29,168
Our childhood.

757
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:32,540
Our school days.

758
00:55:33,752 --> 00:55:35,000
For some time now,

759
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:37,708
my Malgudi days memories,

760
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,876
are haunting me..

761
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:43,000
The streets I walked around in,

762
00:55:43,668 --> 00:55:44,916
the school I went to,

763
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:46,832
courtyard of the house where I grew up,

764
00:55:47,876 --> 00:55:49,624
childhood friends…

765
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:53,252
I forgot all these for years, it seems..

766
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:58,084
It is my desire to see all these before I breathe last.

767
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,460
Sir,

768
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,332
Whatever we do,

769
00:56:01,584 --> 00:56:04,332
reach great heights, achieve a lot in life,

770
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:07,208
our hometown, our childhood memories,

771
00:56:07,624 --> 00:56:10,124
Those feeling are irreplaceable;

772
00:56:10,624 --> 00:56:11,752
Super..

773
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:18,708
I’m sure you have pressing reasons 
for not having visited your home town, isn't it?

774
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:19,916
What is that?

775
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:24,292
Tell me, sir

776
00:56:31,624 --> 00:56:32,540
Lineta

777
00:56:38,332 --> 00:56:39,084
Lineta??

778
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,376
Nice name

779
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:45,332
Who is that?

780
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:48,540
Tell me sir.

781
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:49,916
Sir Please

782
00:56:50,876 --> 00:56:51,460
Please

783
00:56:52,084 --> 00:56:52,792
Sir, please

784
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,668
Sounds interesting, Sir, Please

785
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:59,084
If you don’t tell me, I’ll not move the car..

786
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:00,832
No, Let it go

787
00:57:01,124 --> 00:57:01,832
Please !!!

788
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,416
Lineta

789
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:14,500
I wonder how she is?

790
00:57:14,876 --> 00:57:16,460
Whether she is alive or not..

791
00:57:20,584 --> 00:57:23,168
But in my heart, 
she is just the same Lineta

792
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:28,252
She is only 16 years old

793
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,500
Same smile,

794
00:57:32,124 --> 00:57:33,168
Same sharp look

795
00:57:34,332 --> 00:57:35,460
Graceful walk

796
00:57:37,168 --> 00:57:39,084
first girl I loved ……

797
00:57:40,376 --> 00:57:41,040
Lineta

798
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:44,960
You mean your first crush?

799
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,708
In your dictionary, yes

800
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:51,376
Sir, I insist, that you tell me Lineta story

801
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:55,252
Please

802
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:58,292
Didn’t I tell you mine? Tell me

803
00:58:02,668 --> 00:58:04,752
I studied till 10th standard,

804
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,876
at the Malgudi Government High School

805
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,460
Malgudi….

806
00:58:12,876 --> 00:58:14,960
That name has a different feel to it.

807
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:28,168
I feel so proud to say that 
I was born in Malgudi

808
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,916
I studied in this Malgudi’s High School

809
00:58:35,252 --> 00:58:36,960
Govt High School.

810
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:42,084
Malgudi was the only place 
where it rains nine months a year

811
00:58:49,252 --> 00:58:50,252
Month of June

812
00:58:52,332 --> 00:58:54,584
Promoted from 9th,

813
00:58:55,252 --> 00:58:57,332
just entered class 10

814
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:05,124
My school days were no different from other's

815
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,500
We had a gang

816
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,000
Me,

817
00:59:10,668 --> 00:59:11,540
Santhu,

818
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:13,292
Ramanna

819
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,916
Vimala

820
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:20,584
We were a fun loving, naughty bunch

821
00:59:37,584 --> 00:59:38,252
Me,

822
00:59:38,376 --> 00:59:39,124
Ramanna,

823
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:39,960
Santhu,

824
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,668
Vimala,

825
00:59:41,332 --> 00:59:45,376
We were classmates since first standard

826
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:51,000
We were extremely close to each other

827
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:56,084
Rammana was the prankster of the group

828
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:21,252
WELCOME TO 
10TH STANDARD.

829
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:40,916
In our school,

830
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,752
we had a teacher called Saraswathi

831
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,084
I have come this far,

832
01:00:49,124 --> 01:00:50,752
only because of her

833
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,124
My favourite teacher

834
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:57,000
She too was admiring me

835
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:59,376
Very nice poem Lakshmi,

836
01:00:59,584 --> 01:01:01,752
Continue like this.. 
You’ll become a great poet

837
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:08,668
She used to identify each student’s interest 
and encourage them to pursue it

838
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,460
Cheering them up.

839
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:57,168
When things were going like this …

840
01:01:57,876 --> 01:02:02,168
I think it was just three-four days 
since school had started ..

841
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:04,960
Children, we are done for the day

842
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,332
I'll continue this tomorrow, okay?

843
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:10,084
Lakshmi, get these books 
and come to staff room

844
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,460
That day it was raining heavily

845
01:02:17,752 --> 01:02:18,960
In that rain,

846
01:02:20,584 --> 01:02:22,624
I saw Lineta for the first time

847
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:47,460
Imagine if rain was a woman, 
how pleasant it would have looked,

848
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:53,540
that’s how pleasant to my eyes Lineta was!

849
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:57,624
Please submit the documents 
that I have asked for at your earliest.

850
01:02:57,832 --> 01:02:59,500
I’ll tell the class teacher now

851
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:01,376
Let she attend the class today itself.

852
01:03:02,752 --> 01:03:04,500
No problem, I will arrange

853
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,332
Leave, leave, leave

854
01:03:20,376 --> 01:03:20,960
Leave dude

855
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,540
Let me play..

856
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:22,624
Listen here..

857
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:23,752
What’s your problem man?

858
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:28,252
A beautiful girl has joined our school today

859
01:03:28,376 --> 01:03:29,500
New girl?

860
01:03:30,624 --> 01:03:33,376
That too, to our class only

861
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:36,500
And she is my mine!

862
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:37,960
What you mean by `mine'?

863
01:03:38,584 --> 01:03:39,252
Well…

864
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,460
I mean she is my girl

865
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,292
What is it? Is it shared so quickly?

866
01:03:44,668 --> 01:03:46,460
Let her come to our class first

867
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:50,792
Then we will discuss and take a call, right?

868
01:03:50,876 --> 01:03:52,040
No, it does not work that way

869
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,040
I saw her before you guys,

870
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,876
Whoever sees her first,

871
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,540
She belongs to him know?

872
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:58,584
I saw her first, so she is mine

873
01:03:58,624 --> 01:04:00,960
It is not important who saw her first,

874
01:04:01,376 --> 01:04:04,376
Whom she sees first is important.

875
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:05,584
Correct

876
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,168
Now, when I saw her,

877
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:09,416
is it not obvious that she saw me?

878
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,584
Nothing doing

879
01:04:11,624 --> 01:04:12,624
Look,

880
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:13,752
We will pick a lot,

881
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,668
and will decide whom she should belong.

882
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:19,040
Silence

883
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,668
It’s the teacher, come come…

884
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:22,540
Attention students

885
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:24,792
Why is she here even after her class is over?

886
01:04:26,584 --> 01:04:30,040
Today, a special student is joining our class.

887
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:31,708
Let me introduce her to you

888
01:04:32,252 --> 01:04:32,916
Come in

889
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:47,124
Come

890
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,584
She looks like a doll

891
01:04:52,752 --> 01:04:54,208
This is Lineta

892
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,208
Christian girl,

893
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:58,208
I’m out of the race!

894
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:02,500
Daughter of police officer 
who has been transferred to our town

895
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:06,416
daughter of a policeman! not to me also..!

896
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:11,292
She will study with you, 
in this class from now on

897
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:16,252
Impressing a police’s daughter is tough!

898
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:18,960
Lineta, go sit

899
01:05:24,876 --> 01:05:27,168
Students, I’ll be handling 
the next class as well

900
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,332
Lakshmi, get out!

901
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,832
You have got a good gift, go , go….! 
-I’m sorry teacher.

902
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,208
Take

903
01:05:58,332 --> 01:05:59,124
Free tea

904
01:05:59,752 --> 01:06:01,708
If my father comes, 
he will make us pay for it

905
01:06:04,376 --> 01:06:05,916
Father is policeman.

906
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,292
Daughter comes in a jeep,

907
01:06:08,376 --> 01:06:09,916
Plus she is Christian.

908
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,916
Can we get her?

909
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,000
No, `we' will not get her.

910
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:17,124
That’s what I was thinking

911
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:19,040
But I will get her.

912
01:06:29,832 --> 01:06:33,000
She was not talking with anyone, 
even after a week..

913
01:06:33,876 --> 01:06:35,624
I was seeing her daily..

914
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,624
I noticed that she kept to herself

915
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,708
One day I mustered the courage,

916
01:06:46,124 --> 01:06:48,168
and decided to talk to her.

917
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,876
You go to her..

918
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,376
Ask for Mathematics nones.

919
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,624
She will give it 
You thank her

920
01:06:53,832 --> 01:06:57,584
She will say `Welcome'

921
01:06:58,668 --> 01:06:59,416
What should I say next?

922
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:01,500
Tell her you will return it tomorrow

923
01:07:01,668 --> 01:07:02,292
Then?

924
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,500
It is enough for today,

925
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,708
Rest we will decide while returning the notes tomorrow.

926
01:07:09,668 --> 01:07:13,416
No, No…I’m too scared to ask her! 
How can I ask, tell me?

927
01:07:14,752 --> 01:07:16,916
Will you ask or not??

928
01:07:25,668 --> 01:07:26,292
Aye

929
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,624
Lineta?

930
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:37,832
I, I .. want your Maths…

931
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:40,500
Lineta, give me your mathematics notes

932
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,792
Give

933
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,292
I’ll return it tomorrow Okay?

934
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:01,876
What guys?

935
01:08:02,876 --> 01:08:04,208
Wait!

936
01:08:04,252 --> 01:08:06,376
Aye, today must be last..

937
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:10,460
If we see you talking to her or 
asking for notes hereafter …

938
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:12,832
That is my wish. I will do as I please,

939
01:08:12,832 --> 01:08:14,000
Who the hell are you to ask?

940
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,416
What, you will do what you want, is it?

941
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:16,960
I fell!!!

942
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:17,832
Ramanna

943
01:08:18,832 --> 01:08:21,168
How dare you hit our Ramanna? You….

944
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:23,416
Bring him to ground , hold him

945
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:25,000
Leave me ,

946
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:26,168
He fell..

947
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:36,040
(students fight)

948
01:08:36,624 --> 01:08:38,000
Sir, see them

949
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:44,832
Sir, not me sir

950
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,208
Run, run , Run…

951
01:08:48,168 --> 01:08:51,876
Bhatta, get up, Santhu come 
Run, run , Run…

952
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,916
Look, Mr. Gururaj,

953
01:08:58,624 --> 01:09:02,460
I have got a complaint that you are 
hoisting the flag of your religion, whereever you wish.

954
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:07,292
Don't you know that 
this causes communal riots in society?

955
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,916
Sir, it’s just not a flag,

956
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:13,708
the flag of our religious empire

957
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,668
We don’t need your permission to hoist it.

958
01:09:18,084 --> 01:09:19,416
Look Gururaj,

959
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:21,916
I am telling you,

960
01:09:22,624 --> 01:09:25,584
You set out to hate the other religions..

961
01:09:26,084 --> 01:09:27,208
This is not good.

962
01:09:27,252 --> 01:09:31,376
I don’t need lessons on 
what’s right or wrong from you

963
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:35,252
When it comes to our religion, 
we are ready for anything.

964
01:09:35,376 --> 01:09:36,252
Aye,

965
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:41,876
Hereafter, if you hoist your flags and 
disturb the communal harmony,

966
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:43,916
I will encounter you..

967
01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:47,332
Do it, do what you want.

968
01:09:47,752 --> 01:09:52,124
First check if your bullet is strong enough 
to penetrate our hearts!

969
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:53,916
You are crossing your limit..

970
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:56,124
This is my last warning.

971
01:09:57,252 --> 01:09:58,040
Get out.

972
01:09:58,376 --> 01:09:59,708
I said, Get out.

973
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:14,876
Bro, looks like this SI measures 
everything with two yardsticks.

974
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:17,460
He obstacles our path

975
01:10:17,624 --> 01:10:18,540
Let him..

976
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:23,460
We too will have our time.. Come

977
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,876
It's been years since our country's independence,

978
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:36,752
he is still here.!

979
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:39,124
He is some Mountbattem it seems

980
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,752
Poor thing,

981
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:43,376
Very soon we will ‘free’ him also!

982
01:10:43,624 --> 01:10:45,416
Sure. Sure.

983
01:10:46,168 --> 01:10:46,752
Ya, Ya, we will

984
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,332
Lakshmi,

985
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,292
I will see that Lineta talks to you today

986
01:10:57,752 --> 01:10:58,416
How?

987
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:03,124
Hey, hey …that’s a snake ..snake …what the …

988
01:11:03,916 --> 01:11:06,208
Dude, that’s just a green snake

989
01:11:06,252 --> 01:11:09,540
Green or orange, snake is a snake! 
Won’t it bite?

990
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:11,292
Aye, this won't bite.

991
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:13,460
Even if it bites nothing will happen.

992
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:15,208
But why did you bring it here?

993
01:11:15,332 --> 01:11:20,252
Now, I’ll leave the snake 
where Linetta and other girls are sitting..

994
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:24,168
You go stand near that door..

995
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,792
Lineta will get scared and come running..

996
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,000
will dash you,

997
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:31,208
You hug her tightly..

998
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:32,792
From there on your friendship begins!

999
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:33,876
How is the idea?

1000
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,624
Aye, Nothing will happen if I hug her, is it?

1001
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:39,668
Nothing will happen dude!

1002
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:41,252
How many times I have hugged that Ramani? .

1003
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:41,960
Oho!

1004
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,584
Has anything happened to her?

1005
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,584
Listen dude, nothing will happen

1006
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:47,208
You just go stand there,

1007
01:11:47,376 --> 01:11:49,124
I’ll take care of the rest. Go.

1008
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:17,124
Snake, snake , snake, it’s a snake…

1009
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:17,832
Snake,

1010
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,500
Snake, snake,

1011
01:12:29,168 --> 01:12:31,084
Lineta, take your Maths notes

1012
01:12:33,124 --> 01:12:33,752
Thank you

1013
01:12:44,084 --> 01:12:50,000
Are you bringing snake to the class?

1014
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:50,832
Sir, we didn’t get it

1015
01:12:50,876 --> 01:12:54,124
When we were passing by the forests 
it has crept into my bag sir..

1016
01:12:54,168 --> 01:12:55,376
We didn’t’ do anything sir

1017
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,752
Please don’t beat sir

1018
01:13:05,376 --> 01:13:06,332
Is it hurting?

1019
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:09,168
No, you?

1020
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:09,832
No

1021
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:11,832
Then you were wailing there?

1022
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:13,332
I was pretending,

1023
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,084
If I hadn’t done so, 
he would have beaten us more

1024
01:13:21,332 --> 01:13:21,752
What?

1025
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:27,916
Aye, Come, come.. 
- What is this?

1026
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,416
No, no, leave me,

1027
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,376
Come, Come.. 
- A minute..

1028
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,668
You wanted to tell me something? 
What is it?

1029
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,376
Go dude 
- Nothing,

1030
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:44,624
Tell dude, tell 
Go

1031
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:47,708
I won’t mind, tell me

1032
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:50,752
That is …I

1033
01:13:51,084 --> 01:13:54,916
I love you..

1034
01:14:01,124 --> 01:14:02,500
Do you know my father?

1035
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:03,208
Police.

1036
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,584
Wait. I’ll tell him 
and have you put behind bars

1037
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:07,460
Jail???

1038
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:18,000
Mom..

1039
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,792
What happened?

1040
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:24,500
Dream..

1041
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:26,540
Okay, go back to sleep

1042
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,752
Yesterday's lesson was about World War II..

1043
01:14:38,252 --> 01:14:40,040
When was the world war II ended?

1044
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:45,960
You tell..

1045
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,376
You?

1046
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:56,332
You sit down.

1047
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,000
You?

1048
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:02,540
Dude, he has not asked Lineta..

1049
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,584
You don't remember yesterday's lesson..

1050
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:09,040
How will you remember lessons of the whole year, 
for annual exams?

1051
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,168
Go and do something else.

1052
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:15,292
Sir, you have asked questions to all of us.

1053
01:15:15,332 --> 01:15:16,916
You didn't ask Lineta,

1054
01:15:18,668 --> 01:15:21,292
Ask her also Sir, if she knows let her answer

1055
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:26,460
Though you know that she is dumb, 
you are insisting me to ask her?

1056
01:15:26,668 --> 01:15:28,124
She is speech-impaired it seems!

1057
01:15:28,292 --> 01:15:29,416
Can't speak?

1058
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,168
Oh..

1059
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,208
Whatever I say, she keeps smiling..

1060
01:15:36,292 --> 01:15:37,208
Not talking..

1061
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,624
Even if she knows, how can she tell?

1062
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,208
Do you know the answer?

1063
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,208
She knows it seems..

1064
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:13,252
Write it on board.

1065
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,168
1945,

1066
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,000
Right answer, very good.

1067
01:16:24,584 --> 01:16:25,292
All of you sit down.

1068
01:16:26,124 --> 01:16:28,168
Don't remeber yesterday's lesson.

1069
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,668
You only know, what you read and what you write..

1070
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,876
World war II ends in 1945.

1071
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,416
After two years,

1072
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:38,460
that is, in 1947,

1073
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,960
India gets Independance.

1074
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,040
Ever since her truth came out,

1075
01:16:43,376 --> 01:16:45,752
no one showed interest in talking to her

1076
01:16:46,752 --> 01:16:48,460
She was always by herself

1077
01:16:49,584 --> 01:16:51,832
This started pricking my conscience

1078
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:56,460
The desire to be with her grew even greater

1079
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,332
That is for the day.

1080
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,624
If anybody has any doubt, come to staff rooom.

1081
01:17:14,832 --> 01:17:15,832
Not coming?

1082
01:17:16,252 --> 01:17:17,040
Go on, i’ll be right behind you

1083
01:17:44,668 --> 01:17:47,000
“Friendship is the coming together of two pure hearts.

1084
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:49,708
I will be a partner for 
all your ups and downs

1085
01:17:50,252 --> 01:17:51,832
I am extending the hand for friendship

1086
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:53,208
Your reply?

1087
01:18:05,124 --> 01:18:05,752
Oh,

1088
01:18:06,332 --> 01:18:07,624
Tomorrow..

1089
01:18:18,376 --> 01:18:22,040
Lakshmi, recite the poem that you wrote yesterday.

1090
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,040
Title of the Poem is..

1091
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,876
Mounada Maathu 
(Words of silence)

1092
01:18:29,624 --> 01:18:31,084
“Flowers don’t talk..

1093
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,252
When they bloom, everybody admires

1094
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,084
Water does not speak

1095
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:40,500
If it falls from atop, everybody rejoices.

1096
01:18:41,124 --> 01:18:42,500
The wind does not talk ……

1097
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:45,876
Evening breeze relaxes our mind and body.

1098
01:18:46,752 --> 01:18:47,332
Just like that

1099
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:49,668
You too don’t talk

1100
01:18:50,752 --> 01:18:52,292
But you tell everything..

1101
01:18:53,332 --> 01:18:54,668
By your sharp look.

1102
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:04,916
Wow! That was very nice Lakshmi. Sit

1103
01:19:08,668 --> 01:19:09,708
Lakshmi,

1104
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:54,460
The rain has ripened the heart

1105
01:19:54,624 --> 01:20:02,376
The earth abounds with beauty,

1106
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:09,252
This friendship is sweet

1107
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:16,960
Even the silence speaks.

1108
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,124
The spattering sound of raindrops

1109
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:25,124
Is the sign of friendship with the sky

1110
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:29,040
The rain that brings hearts together

1111
01:20:29,168 --> 01:20:33,084
is itself the scripture

1112
01:20:33,124 --> 01:20:40,416
Like the sacred last birth..

1113
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:48,252
I am blessed by this friendship

1114
01:21:19,084 --> 01:21:26,500
Every word of yours 
sparkles like the raindrops

1115
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:33,876
and as honey close to heart, 
glittering like a blob

1116
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:38,252
For every moment of my life,

1117
01:21:38,332 --> 01:21:41,792
You are my pal

1118
01:21:41,876 --> 01:21:49,292
My heart will wait for you till the end

1119
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,916
Pour, you rain..

1120
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,792
to slide the veil of mind

1121
01:21:57,084 --> 01:22:00,916
Spring, you the waterfall

1122
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:04,960
to forget the tone of flute

1123
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,876
In every words written

1124
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,168
your happiness is supreme

1125
01:22:12,876 --> 01:22:16,416
For this sweet friendship,

1126
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:20,624
even the musical notes falter

1127
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:30,168
The rain has ripened the heart

1128
01:22:30,168 --> 01:22:37,876
The earth abounds with beauty,

1129
01:22:37,876 --> 01:22:44,500
This friendship is sweet

1130
01:22:45,332 --> 01:22:52,124
Even the silence speaks.

1131
01:23:00,376 --> 01:23:01,292
I’m off to school

1132
01:23:28,124 --> 01:23:31,540
Lineta, I have been to several temples

1133
01:23:32,376 --> 01:23:35,460
But I would like to visit church once. 
I have never seen it.

1134
01:23:38,832 --> 01:23:39,832
You will take me?

1135
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,084
Children,

1136
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:18,916
you will be leaving this school after two months.

1137
01:24:19,168 --> 01:24:21,332
But don’t forget this school.

1138
01:24:21,668 --> 01:24:24,124
We may have beaten you and scolded you,

1139
01:24:24,252 --> 01:24:25,708
but all that was for your own good.

1140
01:24:25,752 --> 01:24:27,084
You all are very bright kids.

1141
01:24:27,624 --> 01:24:29,040
Plan your future well

1142
01:24:29,168 --> 01:24:31,460
Whenever you remember this school,

1143
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:35,040
the doors of this school 
will be open for you always.

1144
01:24:51,876 --> 01:24:53,960
Hey boy, you come this side

1145
01:24:54,832 --> 01:24:55,332
Me?

1146
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,208
Yes, you, move to this side.

1147
01:24:59,376 --> 01:25:00,500
Come fast

1148
01:25:00,832 --> 01:25:02,500
Should have sent Lineta also..

1149
01:25:07,584 --> 01:25:08,208
keep quiet

1150
01:25:16,332 --> 01:25:26,752
We want justice! 
Down! Down! Malgudi police

1151
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:34,084
Down with convertions

1152
01:25:34,084 --> 01:25:37,168
We want justice!

1153
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:42,832
Down with Malgudi Police.

1154
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:48,668
Stop Conversion, Save Culture.

1155
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:51,752
Down with Malgudi Police.

1156
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:52,792
Stop it I say.

1157
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:54,292
Down with Malgudi Police.

1158
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:57,332
Why are you shouting?

1159
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,168
Conversions are taking place here.

1160
01:25:59,332 --> 01:26:00,292
Instead of shouting,

1161
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:02,960
are you expecting us to 
welcome this with all the fanfare?

1162
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,460
For that, it is not to 
protest in front of the Police Station.

1163
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:11,084
Give a complaint of the converstion. 
We are here to enquire it.

1164
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:14,084
If protectors only turn perpetrators, 
whom will we complain against?

1165
01:26:14,876 --> 01:26:15,624
Means..

1166
01:26:15,916 --> 01:26:17,916
You are the ones encouraging conversion

1167
01:26:18,876 --> 01:26:20,624
Aye, Shut up.

1168
01:26:20,668 --> 01:26:23,460
Mind your tounge. 
Whom are you talking to?

1169
01:26:23,752 --> 01:26:24,916
Stop pretending Thomas.

1170
01:26:25,832 --> 01:26:28,376
We know you are orchestrating the whole thing..

1171
01:26:28,876 --> 01:26:29,540
Aye,

1172
01:26:30,668 --> 01:26:31,292
What did you say?

1173
01:26:31,332 --> 01:26:32,960
We said what we have seen..

1174
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:36,252
Are you using your daughter to convert an 
innocent Hindu boy in the pretext of love,

1175
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:39,500
and converting the innocent Hindus, 
to strenghthen your religion?

1176
01:26:39,876 --> 01:26:40,708
Aye,

1177
01:26:40,916 --> 01:26:42,376
Shut your mouth, dog

1178
01:26:42,668 --> 01:26:45,584
This Khaki is to protect people.

1179
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,584
Not to do such nasty things.

1180
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:49,376
We have proof for this Thomas,

1181
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,876
to show your daughter took our boy to the Church,

1182
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,916
and the Father preaching to him..

1183
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:57,500
ha..ha..

1184
01:26:58,168 --> 01:27:02,876
How cheap are you to use your daughter for this, 
and pretend like you know nothing?

1185
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:04,252
Is it tit for tat?

1186
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:07,376
We will kick you out of this town 
and hoist our flag.

1187
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:11,124
It will fly high in every nook and corner. 
What are you going to do?

1188
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,208
What I will do?

1189
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,124
What are looking at? Charge.

1190
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:29,668
Down with Malgudi Police.

1191
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,292
We will see you..

1192
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,124
How dare that police guy hit us!

1193
01:27:37,376 --> 01:27:39,208
He invited his own doom by doing so

1194
01:27:39,876 --> 01:27:41,876
We need to make him aware of our might.

1195
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,832
The whole town should burn in this crossfire

1196
01:27:48,708 --> 01:27:49,252
Let’s go

1197
01:27:57,416 --> 01:28:02,124
Gururaj blew a small issue out of proportion

1198
01:28:04,168 --> 01:28:06,084
He had hatred towards Sub Inspector (SI),

1199
01:28:07,624 --> 01:28:09,000
But we became the scapegoats.

1200
01:28:15,376 --> 01:28:18,416
A couple of these men went to the church 
and created a scene there

1201
01:28:20,124 --> 01:28:23,584
In retaliation, the other community 
ransacked temple

1202
01:28:26,416 --> 01:28:28,540
Even the SI was attacked

1203
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:30,916
Situation became tensed

1204
01:28:32,376 --> 01:28:35,252
The entire town 
became victim to communal violence

1205
01:28:44,124 --> 01:28:47,000
They blamed me for the entire thing 
and tried to kill me

1206
01:28:49,332 --> 01:28:52,040
I had to leave town to save myself

1207
01:28:53,168 --> 01:28:54,624
One small incident..

1208
01:28:56,124 --> 01:28:58,500
changed the entire dynamics of a town

1209
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,584
To save my life, I fled from my home town

1210
01:31:12,124 --> 01:31:14,916
Reached Bangalore with someone’s help

1211
01:31:15,168 --> 01:31:17,792
After a few days when I wrote a letter to my town,

1212
01:31:18,832 --> 01:31:20,500
Ramanna replied,

1213
01:31:21,584 --> 01:31:23,876
that my mother died worrying of me.

1214
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,584
What shall I do at the place 
where my mother is no more?

1215
01:31:30,792 --> 01:31:32,916
I lived in an orphanage at Bangalore, 
completed my studies

1216
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:34,832
engaged in writing.

1217
01:31:35,624 --> 01:31:37,416
My writings became popular.

1218
01:31:37,876 --> 01:31:38,960
I became litterateur.

1219
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:42,208
And here I am today

1220
01:31:43,084 --> 01:31:45,376
Sir, then how about your marriage, daughter..

1221
01:31:45,624 --> 01:31:46,624
How did that happen?

1222
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:47,376
Saroja,

1223
01:31:47,832 --> 01:31:50,292
She was a big fan of all my writings.

1224
01:31:50,668 --> 01:31:52,084
She became my wife.

1225
01:31:53,332 --> 01:31:53,876
Means..

1226
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:55,540
That is,

1227
01:31:56,584 --> 01:31:59,416
She used to read all my books and write to me.

1228
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:02,292
I also used to reply.

1229
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:07,752
Then our familiarity turned into friendship

1230
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:10,500
Often,

1231
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:15,124
we used meet near 
Ganapati Temple at Basavanagudi.

1232
01:32:17,124 --> 01:32:22,832
This friendship gradually turned into love

1233
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:25,540
We got married

1234
01:32:26,168 --> 01:32:27,376
thn our daughter is born.

1235
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:31,460
At one stage

1236
01:32:32,252 --> 01:32:33,416
I even stopped writing.

1237
01:32:36,332 --> 01:32:37,252
She too left me..

1238
01:32:40,376 --> 01:32:41,916
You are very lucky Sir

1239
01:32:43,668 --> 01:32:45,376
Not everybody gets their love.

1240
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,668
That too you married your fan!

1241
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:50,540
You are realy very lucky.

1242
01:32:52,832 --> 01:32:53,752
That is true.

1243
01:32:56,124 --> 01:32:57,584
Sir, one thing is clear

1244
01:32:57,792 --> 01:32:58,500
What?

1245
01:32:59,252 --> 01:33:02,000
You are not going to see Malugudi.

1246
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:03,668
Is it not to see Lineta?

1247
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:05,252
I know.

1248
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:11,332
If I wanted to see Lineta,

1249
01:33:12,792 --> 01:33:14,292
I would have gone long back.

1250
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:17,460
Sir,

1251
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:19,624
we are any way going to Malgudi,

1252
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,292
Lineta also will be there.

1253
01:33:22,084 --> 01:33:23,000
Shall we meet?

1254
01:33:23,292 --> 01:33:24,252
Oh, no, no..

1255
01:33:24,416 --> 01:33:24,832
No.

1256
01:33:26,252 --> 01:33:28,252
I have no courage to meet her again.

1257
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:31,832
Nor I am worthy of it.

1258
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:36,040
Lineta is the nectar chapter of my life.

1259
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,208
I don't want to continue that chapter again.

1260
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:42,040
Sir,

1261
01:33:42,332 --> 01:33:43,416
whatever you say,

1262
01:33:43,876 --> 01:33:45,668
first crush is always beautiful

1263
01:33:46,292 --> 01:33:49,376
Whenever we think of them, it makes us happy

1264
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,332
That's why it is called love.

1265
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:55,208
Sir, we have arrived in Malgudi

1266
01:33:57,124 --> 01:33:58,252
Have we arrived so soon?

1267
01:33:58,540 --> 01:33:59,332
yes.

1268
01:34:58,292 --> 01:35:00,124
See bro, SI’s daughter

1269
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,252
She is SI's Daughter.

1270
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:04,500
Is he not our Girijamma's son?

1271
01:35:05,292 --> 01:35:06,668
What is he doing in church?

1272
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,792
They go to the same school.

1273
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,752
He may have gone to see the church.

1274
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:12,960
No one goes just like that.

1275
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:13,460
Then?

1276
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:15,416
These Christian girls

1277
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,500
under the pretext of loving Hindu boys,

1278
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,460
take them to church and convert them.

1279
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:22,752
Aye, there is nothing like conversion and all..

1280
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:24,000
I too know that.

1281
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:25,668
But,

1282
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:29,708
to drive away Thomas from this town,

1283
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:33,332
we won't get another weapon, stronger than this.

1284
01:35:33,832 --> 01:35:34,960
Aye, go..

1285
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:36,208
get the boys ready

1286
01:35:36,584 --> 01:35:37,752
Okay Bro..

1287
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:46,416
Down with conversion.

1288
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:19,752
This is very ground where I playing..

1289
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,624
Everything has changed

1290
01:36:32,624 --> 01:36:34,876
Sir, we are in Malgudi. Next?

1291
01:36:35,376 --> 01:36:37,752
I feel like visiting my school

1292
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,624
School? Okay let's go.

1293
01:36:57,332 --> 01:36:58,752
I used to climb this flag post up on,

1294
01:36:59,876 --> 01:37:01,500
Independence Day,

1295
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:05,000
Rajyotsava, Republic day or any other days,

1296
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:11,792
hoist the flag, and climb down the pole 
with great speed.

1297
01:37:12,792 --> 01:37:15,252
All the students used to watch me intently.

1298
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:19,376
Because I was the only one doing this 
in the whole school.

1299
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,584
Oh, nice

1300
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:15,208
I used to sit here

1301
01:38:15,376 --> 01:38:16,332
Linetta,

1302
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,540
used to sit on that bench

1303
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:46,416
Lakshmi,

1304
01:38:46,876 --> 01:38:48,292
where were you all these years?

1305
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:50,792
Do you know from how many years 
I have been waiting for you?

1306
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:53,376
And you are coming now!

1307
01:38:53,624 --> 01:38:55,292
Is he not a great litterateur today?

1308
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:57,292
How would he remember us!

1309
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,792
In school you wanted us..

1310
01:39:01,332 --> 01:39:02,708
Now you don’t need us, do you?

1311
01:39:03,876 --> 01:39:06,168
After all we are village folks, you know?

1312
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,792
He is city dweller today.

1313
01:39:08,168 --> 01:39:09,708
If he takes the names Village, friends,

1314
01:39:09,876 --> 01:39:11,668
won't his worth go down?

1315
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:23,500
Lakshminarayana

1316
01:39:33,292 --> 01:39:36,332
Lakshminarayana 
Lineta

1317
01:39:53,876 --> 01:39:54,832
One minute, one minute

1318
01:39:57,460 --> 01:40:00,000
Do you see a broken statue there?

1319
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,584
There is a big story behind that

1320
01:40:04,752 --> 01:40:05,332
What is it?

1321
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:35,460
Sir, how many such stories do you have?

1322
01:40:35,668 --> 01:40:37,708
Oh, I will tell you along the way.

1323
01:40:39,168 --> 01:40:40,332
Shall we go?

1324
01:40:44,832 --> 01:40:45,752
SIr, next?

1325
01:40:47,584 --> 01:40:49,708
I feel like going to school again.

1326
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,876
If that could be done,

1327
01:40:52,876 --> 01:40:55,124
everybody would be going back to school.

1328
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:58,124
I asked, where to go next?

1329
01:41:01,584 --> 01:41:03,752
This is where Ramanna’s hotel was.

1330
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,960
I don’t know if it is still theirs.

1331
01:41:12,416 --> 01:41:13,752
Aye, Lakshmu!

1332
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:17,376
Ramanna, Ramanna

1333
01:41:19,252 --> 01:41:21,624
It has been years since I have seen you!

1334
01:41:21,624 --> 01:41:24,168
After leaving this town, 
I am seeing you today only!

1335
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,000
I am so happy to see you.

1336
01:41:26,124 --> 01:41:27,792
Come here, come sit

1337
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,252
How have you been dude? 
- I am good

1338
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,376
What Ramanna,

1339
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:39,460
hotel has changed so much?

1340
01:41:41,292 --> 01:41:42,124
How are you?

1341
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,084
I am just the same.

1342
01:41:45,376 --> 01:41:46,460
After my father’s death,

1343
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:48,500
I had to take charge of the hotel.

1344
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:52,000
By the way, Malgudi is not what it used to be.

1345
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,040
It has changed a lot.

1346
01:41:53,252 --> 01:41:55,708
When town is changed, 
the hotel also had to change know?

1347
01:41:58,376 --> 01:42:00,416
Finally you came to Malgudi.!

1348
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:01,960
I am so happy.

1349
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:09,040
Whenever you are seen in media, 
I tell my customers,

1350
01:42:09,084 --> 01:42:11,124
that `we were childhood pals'.

1351
01:42:11,332 --> 01:42:12,376
I am very happy.

1352
01:42:14,084 --> 01:42:15,876
By the way, who is this?

1353
01:42:19,624 --> 01:42:20,252
Thisi is my daughter,

1354
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:21,876
Prakruthi.

1355
01:42:25,292 --> 01:42:25,832
Is it?

1356
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,292
Hello.

1357
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,708
What do you do?

1358
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,584
I am an IT analyst, sir

1359
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,584
I do not understand all this IT, BT

1360
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,000
Even I have not understood it.

1361
01:42:36,252 --> 01:42:38,832
My children are also in Bangalore. 
They too are in the IT, BT.

1362
01:42:38,876 --> 01:42:39,624
Oh, is it?

1363
01:42:40,168 --> 01:42:42,876
They earn well and are well settled.

1364
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:44,500
They come here once a year.

1365
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:46,252
For that,

1366
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,084
can we give up our traditional occupation?

1367
01:42:49,292 --> 01:42:53,624
What happened to Gururaj 
who created the entire ruckus?

1368
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:57,292
He was jailed after that disturbance.

1369
01:42:57,876 --> 01:42:58,500
Oho!

1370
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,624
But once he came out of jail

1371
01:43:00,624 --> 01:43:04,040
he was given MLA ticket, 
just because he was Jail-returned!

1372
01:43:05,168 --> 01:43:07,540
It was even thought that, he would become MLA.

1373
01:43:07,916 --> 01:43:08,624
But,

1374
01:43:08,876 --> 01:43:12,332
when he was going home in the night, 
four persons hacked him to death

1375
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:13,584
Good that it happened.

1376
01:43:14,292 --> 01:43:15,000
That SI?

1377
01:43:15,792 --> 01:43:18,584
After that incident 
he was transferred to somewhere.

1378
01:43:18,792 --> 01:43:20,752
That was the last we heard of him.

1379
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:26,752
Did not Linneta tell you anything?

1380
01:43:28,584 --> 01:43:29,792
No, No..

1381
01:43:30,124 --> 01:43:32,624
After I went to Bengaluru everything changed.

1382
01:43:33,668 --> 01:43:34,876
I was not in touch with Lineta.

1383
01:43:37,252 --> 01:43:38,540
What about our Santu?

1384
01:43:39,124 --> 01:43:41,792
He is settled in Delhi.

1385
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:43,460
He is doing very well

1386
01:43:43,832 --> 01:43:45,460
He came here three years before.

1387
01:43:46,208 --> 01:43:48,416
Whenever he finds time, he calls

1388
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:51,168
Didn't you go near your house?

1389
01:43:51,832 --> 01:43:53,708
No, now that I am here, I will go

1390
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:57,708
But what is there to see, Ramanna?

1391
01:43:59,124 --> 01:43:59,708
Yes.

1392
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:01,540
After your mother’s death,

1393
01:44:01,584 --> 01:44:03,040
house was ruined.

1394
01:44:03,332 --> 01:44:05,668
people looted the house, 
and took away whatever they got.

1395
01:44:06,832 --> 01:44:08,540
Okay Ramanna, I will leave now.

1396
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,832
How can you go without having a cup of tea, 
from my hotel?

1397
01:44:11,916 --> 01:44:12,540
`Two tea.'

1398
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:13,500
No, no,

1399
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:15,500
I have some work to attend.

1400
01:44:16,332 --> 01:44:17,084
I will do this,

1401
01:44:17,792 --> 01:44:21,000
Before I leave, I will definitely visit you again

1402
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,000
You should come.. 
- Definitely.

1403
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,124
I will take leave.. 
- Okay..

1404
01:44:30,832 --> 01:44:31,332
Let's go..

1405
01:44:32,376 --> 01:44:33,168
Bye, uncle

1406
01:44:45,208 --> 01:44:46,292
For one last time,

1407
01:44:47,876 --> 01:44:49,876
I feel like seeing my mother

1408
01:44:51,332 --> 01:44:52,624
Is your mother still there?

1409
01:44:56,708 --> 01:44:58,584
In the memories of my home,

1410
01:44:59,584 --> 01:45:01,124
my mother is immortal.

1411
01:45:34,124 --> 01:45:37,292
Sowing the light of confidence

1412
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:41,000
Riding the dream horse

1413
01:45:41,084 --> 01:45:43,460
Passing the cross road,

1414
01:45:43,752 --> 01:45:47,292
Climbing the mountain

1415
01:45:47,832 --> 01:45:51,208
Reaching the peak fast

1416
01:45:51,376 --> 01:45:54,252
With the smile of success

1417
01:45:54,252 --> 01:46:00,540
The entire world underneath my feet

1418
01:46:00,752 --> 01:46:04,876
Mom, it is only your memory

1419
01:46:04,876 --> 01:46:07,168
that is in the mind

1420
01:46:07,376 --> 01:46:11,752
The silence within me

1421
01:46:11,752 --> 01:46:14,624
The prayer in my breath

1422
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:17,916
You are my courage

1423
01:46:18,168 --> 01:46:21,792
The shadow of valour

1424
01:46:21,832 --> 01:46:27,168
You are light 
that brightens the world, Mom

1425
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:35,000
Krishna is not God to Devaki

1426
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:42,416
Rama is not God to Kausalya

1427
01:46:42,624 --> 01:46:45,960
The mother who gave birth to God,

1428
01:46:46,124 --> 01:46:48,916
Isn’t she a Goddess herself?

1429
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:55,292
I will seek another childhood and

1430
01:46:55,332 --> 01:47:02,000
be a kid in your warm lap, Mom,

1431
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:14,960
Mom, I will be the smile in your life

1432
01:47:16,168 --> 01:47:22,960
My mother, my mother is the God that guards my world

1433
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,000
You are my life,

1434
01:47:26,124 --> 01:47:30,168
You are my conscious

1435
01:47:30,376 --> 01:47:33,540
You are my courage

1436
01:47:33,624 --> 01:47:36,832
The shadow of valour

1437
01:47:37,332 --> 01:47:45,960
You are light 
that brightens the world, Mom

1438
01:47:48,916 --> 01:47:50,332
I lost my mother.

1439
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:53,460
I forgot my roots.

1440
01:47:56,752 --> 01:47:57,708
I am a sinner.

1441
01:48:01,376 --> 01:48:02,332
Being a writer,

1442
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,792
why did I disassociate myself from my people?

1443
01:48:12,708 --> 01:48:14,084
Please console yourself Sir.

1444
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:31,084
Mom..

1445
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,084
There is a store here.

1446
01:48:47,708 --> 01:48:48,584
I will go get a bottle of water.

1447
01:48:49,752 --> 01:48:50,500
One minute

1448
01:48:51,832 --> 01:48:52,376
Thank you.

1449
01:48:56,084 --> 01:48:57,000
Hey, Prakruti

1450
01:48:57,916 --> 01:48:58,752
Hi,

1451
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:00,752
Avi!

1452
01:49:00,916 --> 01:49:02,124
What a surprise!

1453
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:03,460
What are you doing here?

1454
01:49:03,584 --> 01:49:05,876
This is my hometown, 
I have settled down here now

1455
01:49:05,876 --> 01:49:07,540
But you were working in Bengaluru, that one?

1456
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:09,416
I quit that job,

1457
01:49:09,708 --> 01:49:12,208
came back and am now happily 
pursuing agriculture.

1458
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:13,540
What brings you here?

1459
01:49:13,584 --> 01:49:15,792
I had some work, so I came with Sir.

1460
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:17,208
Which sir?

1461
01:49:17,792 --> 01:49:19,916
Lakshminarayana Malgudi, a litterateur

1462
01:49:20,124 --> 01:49:22,124
Oh, my wife is a great fan of his;

1463
01:49:22,168 --> 01:49:23,124
will you introduce me to him?

1464
01:49:23,124 --> 01:49:23,916
I’ll do that

1465
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:24,540
Come

1466
01:49:24,792 --> 01:49:25,624
You stay in Basavanagudi is it?

1467
01:49:25,668 --> 01:49:28,000
When I came to Bengaluru, I didn't had your contact..

1468
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:28,960
So I could not meet you.

1469
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:29,624
Is it?

1470
01:49:29,832 --> 01:49:31,332
Sir, sir....

1471
01:49:32,168 --> 01:49:32,916
Greetings Sir,

1472
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:34,916
This is my friend Avinash.

1473
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,168
We were collegemates

1474
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:37,416
Ohhh

1475
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:38,376
Please sit sir,

1476
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,376
Sir, my wife is a great fan of yours,

1477
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:42,624
she must have read all your books.

1478
01:49:42,624 --> 01:49:43,040
Is it?

1479
01:49:43,168 --> 01:49:44,792
Sir, you are in our town;

1480
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,332
if you come to our house, 
and have a cup of tea, we will be so happy.

1481
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:51,792
We are hard-pressed for time, 
we have to leave now .

1482
01:49:51,832 --> 01:49:52,916
Sir you start out.

1483
01:49:52,916 --> 01:49:55,540
but before that if you come to our house, 
we will be happy.

1484
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,916
Prakruti at least you tell... 
- Avi, listen

1485
01:49:57,916 --> 01:49:58,792
Sir, you don’t have to tell her anything ,

1486
01:49:58,792 --> 01:50:00,292
I insist, you are coming coming to our home.

1487
01:50:00,292 --> 01:50:02,208
Prakruthi get into the car, you are coming that’s it 
- Okay fine, we will come

1488
01:50:02,252 --> 01:50:03,540
Please listen to me.. 
- Follow my two wheeler.

1489
01:50:03,584 --> 01:50:05,000
I’ll be near that shop, bring the car there.

1490
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:18,000
Please come in sir.

1491
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:18,916
Sri..

1492
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,124
I am coming, Avi.

1493
01:50:20,168 --> 01:50:21,500
This place is so peaceful

1494
01:50:22,416 --> 01:50:23,960
in the midst of nature,

1495
01:50:24,376 --> 01:50:25,540
very peaceful, isn't it?

1496
01:50:26,252 --> 01:50:27,708
Sir, the entire garden,

1497
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:29,584
these sakuline plants, bonsai plant,

1498
01:50:29,624 --> 01:50:31,040
everything is maintained by my wife.

1499
01:50:31,084 --> 01:50:31,376
oh,

1500
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:32,832
These things interest her a lot.

1501
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,040
Oh... 
-Please have a seat sir

1502
01:50:34,252 --> 01:50:34,832
Sit.

1503
01:50:35,252 --> 01:50:36,168
Sri, come soon,

1504
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:37,252
why are you taking this long? 
- what Avi?

1505
01:50:38,252 --> 01:50:39,708
Surprise.!

1506
01:50:40,376 --> 01:50:42,084
Sir, sir is that really you?

1507
01:50:42,124 --> 01:50:42,584
Hello,

1508
01:50:42,832 --> 01:50:43,584
Sir, please be seated sir

1509
01:50:43,624 --> 01:50:44,124
That’s alright.

1510
01:50:44,208 --> 01:50:46,500
Sir, I cannot trust my own eyes,

1511
01:50:46,624 --> 01:50:48,876
Actually, I am a big fan of yours sir.

1512
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,208
I have always been telling Avi ,

1513
01:50:50,252 --> 01:50:52,252
that I want to meet you at least once,

1514
01:50:52,252 --> 01:50:53,916
I am so happy to see you sir

1515
01:50:54,168 --> 01:50:54,960
Actually.....

1516
01:50:57,708 --> 01:50:58,752
Prakruti right?

1517
01:50:59,668 --> 01:51:00,252
Ya

1518
01:51:00,752 --> 01:51:02,252
Sringeri Engineering College?

1519
01:51:02,376 --> 01:51:03,124
Yes

1520
01:51:03,292 --> 01:51:04,000
Friends..?

1521
01:51:04,752 --> 01:51:05,624
Hi.. 
- Hi.

1522
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:07,460
Shreeja 
- Nice meeting you

1523
01:51:08,168 --> 01:51:10,584
Sri, prepare something special

1524
01:51:10,584 --> 01:51:13,416
Anything will do, 
why trouble yourself too much?

1525
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,040
Sir, this is no trouble, you please keep quiet.

1526
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,168
What shall I prepare Avi?

1527
01:51:16,752 --> 01:51:19,084
Prakruthi likes, unde kadubu (a dish),

1528
01:51:19,292 --> 01:51:20,124
prepare that.

1529
01:51:20,668 --> 01:51:22,876
you keep talking, 
I will prepare that and be back soon

1530
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,292
You remember?

1531
01:51:24,332 --> 01:51:25,752
Of course.. 
Walk slowly

1532
01:51:25,792 --> 01:51:28,292
So, what do you do Avinash?

1533
01:51:29,292 --> 01:51:30,752
After completing my engineering course,

1534
01:51:30,832 --> 01:51:32,292
I was trying for a job.

1535
01:51:32,584 --> 01:51:36,792
I didn't want to work day and night, 
as data entry person in any company, like a slave.

1536
01:51:37,168 --> 01:51:38,416
I was interested in agriculture,

1537
01:51:38,624 --> 01:51:39,960
so I decided to pursue it.

1538
01:51:40,252 --> 01:51:41,668
Oh, what do you grow?

1539
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,624
This field was in ruined state, 
as nobody was there to plough it

1540
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:48,000
I got it from its owner, 
and started growing paddy.

1541
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:50,500
We give some share of 
whatever we grow to the owner,

1542
01:51:50,624 --> 01:51:51,500
the rest is for us.

1543
01:51:51,916 --> 01:51:54,292
We also grow pepper and areca etc.,

1544
01:51:54,292 --> 01:51:56,208
As of now, 30 persons work here.

1545
01:51:56,332 --> 01:51:57,624
We are doing well.

1546
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:01,124
Very good plan, excellent job!

1547
01:52:01,708 --> 01:52:02,668
Beacause,

1548
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:05,168
whatever progress technology may ,

1549
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,500
the food we eat must come from villages,

1550
01:52:07,916 --> 01:52:09,292
and farmers should grow it.

1551
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,752
If this is understood properly,

1552
01:52:12,332 --> 01:52:14,332
every farmer is an engineer.

1553
01:52:15,332 --> 01:52:16,708
Is he not productive?

1554
01:52:17,460 --> 01:52:19,460
Sri, shall I help you with?

1555
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:21,252
No I will do it, you go.

1556
01:52:22,416 --> 01:52:23,040
Jaggery..

1557
01:52:23,084 --> 01:52:24,832
You go, I will take care of it

1558
01:52:24,876 --> 01:52:26,708
Ask me if you need any help. I will come.

1559
01:52:29,668 --> 01:52:30,376
I said leave.

1560
01:52:30,376 --> 01:52:32,208
I got jaggery, I got jaggery

1561
01:52:37,208 --> 01:52:40,752
Sir, you are back in Malgudi after so many years

1562
01:52:41,292 --> 01:52:42,540
Wav, nice..

1563
01:52:42,584 --> 01:52:44,168
After listening to your story,

1564
01:52:44,376 --> 01:52:46,416
I feel like seeing Lineta.

1565
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,000
What do you say Prakruti?

1566
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,040
Me too.. 
I must see her at least once

1567
01:52:50,584 --> 01:52:52,832
You Naughty girl.

1568
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:54,000
Prakruti,

1569
01:52:54,624 --> 01:52:56,708
let us go back to Bengaluru tomorrow 
as we had planned

1570
01:52:58,124 --> 01:53:01,376
Linetta gave me fond memories 
to my life, no doubt,

1571
01:53:02,792 --> 01:53:04,584
but it is good, if it is in memory only.

1572
01:53:05,916 --> 01:53:08,000
I came here to see my town Malgudi,

1573
01:53:08,876 --> 01:53:09,624
I saw it.

1574
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:12,084
If I go in search of Lineta now,

1575
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,168
after the death of his wife, at this age,

1576
01:53:15,416 --> 01:53:18,416
won’t people laugh at me and saying 
Lakshminarayana is going in search of his childhood friend?

1577
01:53:19,832 --> 01:53:22,332
Let anybody say anything, but we must see her

1578
01:53:22,624 --> 01:53:25,000
We had actually thought of going back,

1579
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,000
but now it is cancelled. 
We will stay back.

1580
01:53:27,168 --> 01:53:29,752
Good idea, you stay here until she is found.

1581
01:53:29,916 --> 01:53:30,668
No problem.

1582
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,252
Mine is also the same opinion.

1583
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:35,332
We will make all arrangements for you here. 
you just stay here

1584
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:38,416
Any day first love is the best love.

1585
01:53:41,208 --> 01:53:41,876
What did you say?

1586
01:53:42,168 --> 01:53:43,168
First love is the best love.

1587
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,500
First love is best love?

1588
01:53:46,916 --> 01:53:48,708
Is it not sir?

1589
01:53:49,876 --> 01:53:50,460
Shall I talk about it?

1590
01:53:50,668 --> 01:53:51,332
Let it go

1591
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:53,000
I will tell 
- I said no

1592
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:53,668
Let me tell..

1593
01:53:53,708 --> 01:53:54,708
What is it?

1594
01:53:54,708 --> 01:53:57,168
Sir, actually these two are not just friends.

1595
01:53:57,708 --> 01:54:00,624
Avi was in love with prakruthi 
when they were in college.

1596
01:54:02,208 --> 01:54:03,584
Is that so?

1597
01:54:03,624 --> 01:54:04,460
Actually that.....

1598
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:07,292
Don't worry, Avi has told me everything

1599
01:54:08,792 --> 01:54:10,460
Actually I was loving her a lot,

1600
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,460
but I didn’t had the guts to tell her.

1601
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:14,752
But finally I made up my mind,

1602
01:54:15,252 --> 01:54:16,916
proposed to her on the Farewell Day.

1603
01:54:17,832 --> 01:54:20,292
But she rejected a good boy like me.

1604
01:54:20,332 --> 01:54:21,832
It is not like that,

1605
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:24,332
I did not want to commit so early

1606
01:54:24,668 --> 01:54:26,624
Thanks for rejecting him.

1607
01:54:27,084 --> 01:54:28,376
Otherwise,

1608
01:54:28,376 --> 01:54:30,876
I would have never found a good guy like Avi.

1609
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,124
He is really good guy.

1610
01:54:33,208 --> 01:54:34,540
What is the use of saying that now?

1611
01:54:36,168 --> 01:54:38,832
My wife is a Ph.D. in preparing `unde kadubu' (Lumpy pudding) 
and `akki rotti' ( rice bread)

1612
01:54:38,876 --> 01:54:40,084
taste it and you will know it.

1613
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:42,500
Our Malnad savories' taste is wonderful.

1614
01:54:44,668 --> 01:54:45,668
Do you know one more thing sir?

1615
01:54:45,916 --> 01:54:47,416
Whenever we have fights,

1616
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:48,708
I always tell her,

1617
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,876
I will divorce you,

1618
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:52,460
Prakruthi is waiting for me,

1619
01:54:53,252 --> 01:54:54,876
Oh, I am waiting for you, come..!!

1620
01:54:55,876 --> 01:54:57,500
You like `unde kadubu', right?,

1621
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,624
Eat, my wife has prepared it.

1622
01:55:03,624 --> 01:55:04,500
Serve yourselves.. 
- I need one more “rotti”

1623
01:55:04,792 --> 01:55:05,668
It is prepared by my wife,

1624
01:55:05,708 --> 01:55:07,376
How many times will you say it’s your wife's preparation?

1625
01:55:07,752 --> 01:55:08,708
It is very nice.

1626
01:55:14,084 --> 01:55:16,292
Hey, I wanted to tell you yesterday itself,

1627
01:55:16,708 --> 01:55:18,376
your car is super.

1628
01:55:18,668 --> 01:55:19,208
It is my friend’s

1629
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,332
Do you want to drive it?

1630
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,208
You used to come to college in this jeep right?

1631
01:55:24,292 --> 01:55:25,208
Yes, the same jeep.

1632
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:27,832
I learnt driving in this jeep only.

1633
01:55:27,832 --> 01:55:28,668
Is it?

1634
01:55:28,668 --> 01:55:29,460
He only taught me.

1635
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:43,540
If I meet Lineta,

1636
01:55:44,584 --> 01:55:46,168
I will first apologise to her.

1637
01:55:48,916 --> 01:55:50,416
In case I meet her,

1638
01:55:51,416 --> 01:55:53,500
will she talk to me?

1639
01:55:54,208 --> 01:55:55,252
Do not worry Sir,

1640
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:59,000
Just wait and see how she will blush 
as she sees you.

1641
01:56:01,292 --> 01:56:03,124
You are weaving good story.

1642
01:56:03,668 --> 01:56:06,124
she will blush it seems!

1643
01:56:07,252 --> 01:56:09,208
I told you that day only,

1644
01:56:09,332 --> 01:56:12,460
he has been transferred 
immediately after that riot.

1645
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:15,460
So, they left this town overnight

1646
01:56:15,916 --> 01:56:19,292
You better to enquire at 
Someshwara police station.

1647
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:20,332
Okay..

1648
01:56:26,124 --> 01:56:28,332
Sir, have you given her any gift?

1649
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,916
I had not given her anything,

1650
01:56:32,584 --> 01:56:35,584
but she had gifted me a fountain pen.

1651
01:56:39,624 --> 01:56:41,832
I had preserved it very carefully,

1652
01:56:43,416 --> 01:56:45,252
I don't know where I lost it afterwards.

1653
01:56:46,752 --> 01:56:50,376
But the memories of my time with her 
are gifts which cannot be lost.

1654
01:57:00,208 --> 01:57:01,208
What’s with these tattoo?

1655
01:57:03,876 --> 01:57:05,040
If you give any gift,

1656
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:07,376
it may be lost, may be forgotten,

1657
01:57:09,168 --> 01:57:10,084
but this

1658
01:57:11,084 --> 01:57:11,832
is permanent.

1659
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,084
What are you thinking about?

1660
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:21,500
Nothing.

1661
01:57:30,124 --> 01:57:31,540
Thomas was

1662
01:57:31,668 --> 01:57:36,252
S I here in this station, between 1975 and 1979.

1663
01:57:36,292 --> 01:57:39,376
The records say that 
he was transferred to Moodbidri later.

1664
01:57:39,792 --> 01:57:41,960
Beyond this, there is no other information.

1665
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,252
Why are you standing?

1666
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:47,124
As there is no chair to sit!

1667
01:57:47,168 --> 01:57:48,084
Okay, stand,

1668
01:57:48,332 --> 01:57:51,416
this government digs good roads for

1669
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,668
white topping

1670
01:57:52,792 --> 01:57:53,752
In our office,

1671
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:56,208
if there is a table, there is no chair or vice versa.

1672
01:57:56,332 --> 01:58:00,252
I was requesting for furniture repeatedly.

1673
01:58:00,584 --> 01:58:02,792
I am fed up of working here!

1674
01:58:02,792 --> 01:58:03,376
Sir, key.

1675
01:58:03,832 --> 01:58:05,832
Did you drop my daughter to school? 
- Yes sir

1676
01:58:06,168 --> 01:58:08,832
Sir, your wife asked you,

1677
01:58:09,084 --> 01:58:12,040
to get 2 Kg. onion and one Kg drumstick 
on the way back home.

1678
01:58:13,416 --> 01:58:16,460
Yesterday only I had brought 2 Kg Drumstick,

1679
01:58:16,708 --> 01:58:18,168
brought 2 Kg onion..

1680
01:58:18,332 --> 01:58:19,584
how can it get over so soon?

1681
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:23,124
How would I know your family secrets, sir?

1682
01:58:24,208 --> 01:58:27,084
See, one Kg. drumstick costs 55 Ruppes,

1683
01:58:27,668 --> 01:58:29,832
1 Kg. tomato 40 Rupees,

1684
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:31,752
I kg. onion 20Rupees,

1685
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,376
A bundle of coriander leaves 25 Rupees.

1686
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:36,792
How can we make both ends meet, 
if this is the situation?

1687
01:58:37,292 --> 01:58:39,252
How can we live with this price rise?

1688
01:58:39,376 --> 01:58:40,500
No, no, no..

1689
01:58:41,708 --> 01:58:42,792
No chance..

1690
01:58:44,252 --> 01:58:46,292
Can you please call the Moodbidri police station and

1691
01:58:46,624 --> 01:58:49,832
enquire about SI Thomas?

1692
01:58:49,876 --> 01:58:52,292
The present SI Shankar is my friend,

1693
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:53,668
I will call him right now.

1694
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,376
Hello Shankar, how are you?

1695
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,584
I need an information.

1696
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,792
In 1979,

1697
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:07,752
from our Someshwar station,

1698
01:59:07,832 --> 01:59:09,168
an SI named Thomas

1699
01:59:09,208 --> 01:59:10,416
was transferred to Moodbididri.

1700
01:59:10,832 --> 01:59:14,708
Please find his whereabouts and text me.

1701
01:59:17,124 --> 01:59:21,668
I have been repeatedly asking 
for a transfer from this station,

1702
01:59:21,792 --> 01:59:22,792
they are not transferring.

1703
01:59:23,084 --> 01:59:23,832
If I ask them,

1704
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:25,752
they say, reduce your weught by 10 Kg,

1705
01:59:25,752 --> 01:59:27,752
we will transfer you to the station of your choice.

1706
01:59:28,668 --> 01:59:29,624
You only tell me,

1707
01:59:29,752 --> 01:59:30,668
at this age,

1708
01:59:30,832 --> 01:59:33,500
can I reduce my weight?

1709
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:39,252
It is not possible sir, you surely can't!

1710
01:59:39,708 --> 01:59:40,960
You said it.

1711
01:59:41,084 --> 01:59:42,124
Yes, yes.

1712
01:59:45,916 --> 01:59:47,084
Ohhhho...

1713
01:59:47,624 --> 01:59:48,960
SI Thomas

1714
01:59:49,124 --> 01:59:51,916
was transferred from Moodbidri to Hosanagara.

1715
01:59:51,916 --> 01:59:54,668
He has only this information, he says.

1716
01:59:57,208 --> 01:59:59,124
If you go there and enquire,

1717
01:59:59,252 --> 02:00:00,416
you may get information.

1718
02:00:00,668 --> 02:00:01,460
You were of great help.

1719
02:00:01,668 --> 02:00:02,416
Thank you 
- We will take leave

1720
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,000
Rohan,

1721
02:00:05,208 --> 02:00:06,752
Other than drumsticks and onions,

1722
02:00:06,752 --> 02:00:07,832
what else, she has asked to bring?

1723
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:39,040
We are all but sailors in the boat of memories

1724
02:00:39,084 --> 02:00:45,376
Sailing between one shore and another

1725
02:00:46,084 --> 02:00:51,124
searching for the path we left behind 
After serving here,

1726
02:00:51,168 --> 02:00:52,792
he was transferred to Malur.

1727
02:00:52,792 --> 02:00:58,792
If you enquire there, you may know. 
by opening each and every page

1728
02:00:58,792 --> 02:01:01,376
In the trap of illusion

1729
02:01:01,624 --> 02:01:04,084
is it a haunting memory?

1730
02:01:05,084 --> 02:01:08,292
In the river of emotion

1731
02:01:08,416 --> 02:01:11,500
is it roaming memory?

1732
02:01:11,708 --> 02:01:14,332
In the trap of illusion

1733
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:16,960
is it a haunting memory?

1734
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:20,084
In the trap of love

1735
02:01:20,084 --> 02:01:23,252
is it the memory that haunt us?

1736
02:01:35,916 --> 02:01:42,624
Beautiful.. life is beautiful..

1737
02:01:42,668 --> 02:01:48,960
even with little happiness

1738
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:54,916
Bond.. bond with everybody..

1739
02:01:55,084 --> 02:02:00,540
until we breath our last

1740
02:02:03,832 --> 02:02:04,252
Hello..

1741
02:02:04,332 --> 02:02:05,332
Where are you?

1742
02:02:05,376 --> 02:02:06,416
I am in my hometown.

1743
02:02:06,708 --> 02:02:08,752
I have not used my car properly..

1744
02:02:08,876 --> 02:02:10,960
You have taken it for a day, 
but how many days now?

1745
02:02:11,168 --> 02:02:11,960
When are you returning?

1746
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,792
I didn't here anything.. bye, bye.

1747
02:02:14,124 --> 02:02:20,084
Searching those footprints you have left behind,

1748
02:02:20,124 --> 02:02:26,624
you seek the bygone journey again

1749
02:02:27,292 --> 02:02:32,708
We are all but sailors in the boat of memories

1750
02:02:33,124 --> 02:02:39,752
Sailing between one shore and another

1751
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:43,960
Let us set out early in the morning tomorrow.

1752
02:02:44,332 --> 02:02:46,208
By 9.30 we will be in Sringeri.

1753
02:02:46,416 --> 02:02:49,168
No, somehow I don't feel like going..

1754
02:02:50,832 --> 02:02:52,332
We will return tomorrow itself..

1755
02:02:52,752 --> 02:02:55,208
We have searched so far, 
we will definitly find her.

1756
02:02:55,708 --> 02:02:57,500
Let us try once tomorrow, Sir

1757
02:02:59,668 --> 02:03:00,084
Okay.

1758
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:01,916
Let's try tomorrow also.

1759
02:03:02,876 --> 02:03:04,332
But if we do not find her tomorrow,

1760
02:03:04,376 --> 02:03:06,168
you should not force me again.

1761
02:03:06,208 --> 02:03:07,916
Sir, we will definitely find her.

1762
02:03:10,668 --> 02:03:12,084
Hey, what happened?

1763
02:03:12,252 --> 02:03:13,916
Why are you dull?

1764
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:15,040
Nothing like that.

1765
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:17,040
I too am observing from afternoon..

1766
02:03:17,584 --> 02:03:19,540
she is thinking of something very deeply.

1767
02:03:20,168 --> 02:03:22,124
We are travelling past two days,

1768
02:03:22,168 --> 02:03:23,708
I am tired a bit. That's all.

1769
02:03:23,752 --> 02:03:24,584
That’s not the case,

1770
02:03:24,832 --> 02:03:25,668
Let me tell you.

1771
02:03:25,916 --> 02:03:26,832
Avi, no,

1772
02:03:26,916 --> 02:03:27,876
Avi, please,

1773
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,960
You keep quiet. I will tell 
- nothing like that..

1774
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:31,040
Avinash, you tell us.

1775
02:03:31,292 --> 02:03:34,500
Today is Vijay’s birthday

1776
02:03:38,252 --> 02:03:39,208
Vijay who?

1777
02:03:39,668 --> 02:03:40,960
Our madam’s

1778
02:03:41,332 --> 02:03:42,292
`special someone’

1779
02:03:44,292 --> 02:03:45,960
Oh, Puducherry Vijay

1780
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:47,708
Why should you feel low over that?

1781
02:03:48,252 --> 02:03:49,376
It is not that,

1782
02:03:50,084 --> 02:03:52,208
Three years ago we broke up,

1783
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:53,832
That too was on his birthday.

1784
02:03:54,376 --> 02:03:56,584
After that, we never spoke.

1785
02:03:57,168 --> 02:04:00,792
We wish each other on our birthdays, that’s it.

1786
02:04:02,832 --> 02:04:05,084
Let me tell you something by my experience.

1787
02:04:06,792 --> 02:04:07,916
Those whom we love,

1788
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:11,252
will be with us only till we love them.

1789
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:14,000
Even if we do a small mistake,

1790
02:04:14,876 --> 02:04:15,792
they disappear.

1791
02:04:17,168 --> 02:04:18,332
But those who love us,

1792
02:04:19,376 --> 02:04:22,376
will correct us, 
even if we have made several mistakes;

1793
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:24,584
and love us all the more.

1794
02:04:26,208 --> 02:04:30,460
Whatever and whenever 
we are destined to get, we should.

1795
02:04:33,668 --> 02:04:35,084
Once time passes away,

1796
02:04:35,832 --> 02:04:37,040
that too slips from us.

1797
02:04:38,168 --> 02:04:40,792
I am the best example for it.

1798
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,540
Call and speak to him,

1799
02:04:44,752 --> 02:04:46,292
everything will turn out fine.

1800
02:04:47,292 --> 02:04:48,500
He may have forgotten me,

1801
02:04:48,876 --> 02:04:51,376
or he may have committed with 
some other girl.

1802
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:52,832
No, don’t.

1803
02:04:53,668 --> 02:04:54,832
Impossible!

1804
02:04:56,208 --> 02:04:58,752
If he really loves you,

1805
02:04:59,376 --> 02:05:01,916
he will wait till you get married at least.

1806
02:05:03,624 --> 02:05:04,960
Call him and say `sorry'.

1807
02:05:06,292 --> 02:05:08,916
By asking `sorry' nobody becomes small. 
Isn't it?

1808
02:05:09,252 --> 02:05:10,376
I don’t have courage.

1809
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:11,332
Tell Avi.

1810
02:05:11,376 --> 02:05:12,332
You text him.

1811
02:05:12,416 --> 02:05:13,460
you will definitely get reply.

1812
02:05:14,208 --> 02:05:15,416
What if I do not get one?

1813
02:05:15,624 --> 02:05:17,040
Take, text him.

1814
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:18,460
Do it.

1815
02:05:18,624 --> 02:05:19,584
Type fast..

1816
02:05:19,584 --> 02:05:21,084
What you have to say is… 
- I’ll type

1817
02:05:21,584 --> 02:05:22,540
All that she’ll know!

1818
02:05:22,916 --> 02:05:23,540
Did you do it?

1819
02:05:24,168 --> 02:05:24,792
One second,

1820
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:25,624
sent it?

1821
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:27,208
Just a second

1822
02:05:27,584 --> 02:05:28,584
Is it sent? 
- Yes.

1823
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,416
Is it delivered?

1824
02:05:34,832 --> 02:05:35,540
Must be delivered.

1825
02:05:44,168 --> 02:05:45,376
Message is delivered.

1826
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,376
He has read it.

1827
02:05:50,292 --> 02:05:51,624
All this happened because of you guys.

1828
02:05:57,208 --> 02:05:58,500
If he does not come here..

1829
02:08:00,124 --> 02:08:01,124
I knew

1830
02:08:02,708 --> 02:08:04,624
that you would be back in my life.

1831
02:08:06,124 --> 02:08:07,540
But you should not have done that ya..

1832
02:08:09,668 --> 02:08:11,916
Actually, that day I came to propose to you

1833
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:13,584
Really?

1834
02:08:13,916 --> 02:08:14,332
Really?

1835
02:08:15,792 --> 02:08:18,000
I too came to propose

1836
02:08:19,416 --> 02:08:19,960
What?

1837
02:08:20,916 --> 02:08:23,584
That day, I had told my friend that I would propose.

1838
02:08:23,624 --> 02:08:26,084
She kept texting me, asking what happened.

1839
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:28,124
I was just replying to her.

1840
02:08:29,708 --> 02:08:31,916
I thought that you were chatting 
with somebody else,

1841
02:08:32,084 --> 02:08:33,708
I thought you were not interested.

1842
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:39,084
Sorry,

1843
02:08:40,584 --> 02:08:41,960
all these beacause of me.

1844
02:08:42,708 --> 02:08:44,832
I didn't reply your calls.

1845
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:47,084
all this is my mistake.

1846
02:08:48,624 --> 02:08:49,876
It is okay baba..

1847
02:08:51,208 --> 02:08:52,960
It’s okay, show me your hand.

1848
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,124
I am ready, shall we leave?

1849
02:09:26,584 --> 02:09:27,708
What is this?

1850
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:31,000
Dressed up as if 
you are going to attend some function.

1851
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:33,584
We are going to Sringeri anyway,

1852
02:09:33,708 --> 02:09:35,000
There is a ‘pooja’ at my home.

1853
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,500
So I thought I’ll introduce him to my mother.

1854
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:41,376
Oh! This means we will soon have, 
wedding banquet.

1855
02:09:42,292 --> 02:09:43,624
On the way to Sringeri,

1856
02:09:43,876 --> 02:09:45,208
get me a good tender coconut. 
- you forgot your mobile.

1857
02:09:45,208 --> 02:09:47,292
Sir, I will get you the best one. 
- Thank you.

1858
02:09:47,292 --> 02:09:48,252
Bye,

1859
02:09:49,416 --> 02:09:51,332
Okay, we will get going now.

1860
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:53,332
Shall we have a selfie?

1861
02:09:53,624 --> 02:09:56,252
When you say selfie, girls’ faces brighten up..

1862
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:17,624
Mom,

1863
02:10:17,668 --> 02:10:18,540
Finally you are here.

1864
02:10:19,252 --> 02:10:20,208
How are you?

1865
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:21,416
I am good.

1866
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:22,960
How are you? 
- I am good

1867
02:10:24,252 --> 02:10:26,916
This is my mother, my father, 
my whole world.

1868
02:10:27,876 --> 02:10:30,832
Mom, this is Lakshminarayana Sir, 
I was telling you, know?

1869
02:10:30,876 --> 02:10:31,752
Hello

1870
02:10:32,084 --> 02:10:34,332
That is Avi, Avinash, my college friend.

1871
02:10:35,624 --> 02:10:37,168
This is Vijay, my friend

1872
02:10:37,624 --> 02:10:38,168
Hello aunty.

1873
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:39,124
Hello

1874
02:10:39,168 --> 02:10:40,960
How many more days 
will you introduce him as your friend?

1875
02:10:41,168 --> 02:10:42,584
Tell that he is your fiance.

1876
02:10:48,332 --> 02:10:49,752
fiance?

1877
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,960
Not like that, I wanted to tell you.

1878
02:10:56,416 --> 02:11:00,500
Mom, we were colleagues in an IT company.

1879
02:11:01,876 --> 02:11:03,208
We became friends there.

1880
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:07,252
But you didn’t tell me all this?

1881
02:11:07,916 --> 02:11:09,000
Now,

1882
02:11:09,124 --> 02:11:12,168
the boy and girl like each other..

1883
02:11:12,792 --> 02:11:18,208
This is not the time to worry about 
caste, horoscope etc.,

1884
02:11:18,916 --> 02:11:20,292
without making them to give up,

1885
02:11:20,332 --> 02:11:22,000
get them married as soon as possible.

1886
02:11:23,624 --> 02:11:25,668
I have never objected any of her desires.

1887
02:11:26,752 --> 02:11:28,668
Since she has chosen him,

1888
02:11:28,916 --> 02:11:30,832
there can not be a better choice.

1889
02:11:31,792 --> 02:11:33,624
But still, you should have told me.

1890
02:11:33,832 --> 02:11:35,168
Don’t get into drama mode now!

1891
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:40,376
Bring your family members once.

1892
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:41,040
Okay.

1893
02:11:41,084 --> 02:11:42,752
We will all sit together and discuss. 
- Okay

1894
02:11:43,292 --> 02:11:45,084
In fact, today's Pooja is,

1895
02:11:45,168 --> 02:11:47,460
for the blessings of almighty 
to get her married soon.

1896
02:11:47,876 --> 02:11:51,292
See, the result has come 
even before the ‘pooja’ begins,

1897
02:11:51,332 --> 02:11:52,708
So why delay?

1898
02:11:53,292 --> 02:11:55,460
Come.. Puja begins.

1899
02:12:10,376 --> 02:12:11,208
Enough.

1900
02:12:12,168 --> 02:12:14,252
Holige’ (pancake) and ghee - 
beautiful combination

1901
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:16,084
Yes.

1902
02:12:16,416 --> 02:12:18,708
you must have one more, 
That’s why finish it fast.

1903
02:12:18,752 --> 02:12:20,000
Why just one, let me have two more..

1904
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:24,960
When you come next time, 
stay at least for a week

1905
02:12:25,124 --> 02:12:26,208
Not just for a week,

1906
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:27,752
I will stay over for a month.

1907
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:32,832
Prakruti,

1908
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:34,752
I’ll head back to Bengaluru.

1909
02:12:34,792 --> 02:12:35,960
We will meet once you are there.

1910
02:12:36,416 --> 02:12:38,708
Mom, when I come next, 
I will bring my family members along.

1911
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,584
Will do 
- Okay, Bye

1912
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:47,832
Bye, Sir bye.

1913
02:12:47,916 --> 02:12:48,752
aye, let be good.

1914
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:51,792
We will also take leave.

1915
02:12:51,876 --> 02:12:54,500
let be good.. 
- Bye.

1916
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:04,876
Sir, if you have a photo of Linneta, 
we would like to see

1917
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:07,332
How?

1918
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,792
We didn’t had mobile phones then, 
to preserve our memories

1919
02:13:12,376 --> 02:13:13,916
You generation is far better.

1920
02:13:14,416 --> 02:13:17,916
You meet through Facebook, Whatsapp, 
Groups, whenever you feel like

1921
02:13:18,252 --> 02:13:19,752
You will stay connected.

1922
02:13:20,252 --> 02:13:21,252
No sir,

1923
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:24,540
We too remember our 
school and college friends

1924
02:13:24,876 --> 02:13:25,752
But won't meet.

1925
02:13:26,084 --> 02:13:31,916
there will be messages saying 
`Will meet in Whatsapp group, let's have reunion'

1926
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,040
But nobody will meet.

1927
02:13:33,668 --> 02:13:34,876
It is not that Prakruthi.

1928
02:13:35,376 --> 02:13:38,584
When in college, only our classmates 
are our friends

1929
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:41,540
but once we step out in to the real world, our circle widens

1930
02:13:41,916 --> 02:13:43,208
Our responsibilities also increase,

1931
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:45,252
If one finds time, others do not.

1932
02:13:45,876 --> 02:13:47,292
Especially girls will have excuses like,

1933
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:49,040
`must drop my child to school',

1934
02:13:49,252 --> 02:13:50,584
`husband didn't permit me'

1935
02:13:50,668 --> 02:13:51,668
`my mother-in-law is sick'

1936
02:13:51,708 --> 02:13:52,792
like things..

1937
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:54,792
Not that sort.

1938
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,624
We too will have more responsibilities, 
once we are married.

1939
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:02,000
Mother in law, Father in law, husband, 
his family, their functions,

1940
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,376
That itself is a different world.

1941
02:14:04,876 --> 02:14:07,460
By the way, after our college days, you are meeting today.!

1942
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:09,916
Did you call, or texted? 
You never remebered us.

1943
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:11,708
Hey, I am a married person now!

1944
02:14:11,708 --> 02:14:12,040
So?

1945
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:13,668
One minute.

1946
02:14:13,792 --> 02:14:15,708
this is a never ending argument.

1947
02:14:16,624 --> 02:14:18,332
Friendship, Love

1948
02:14:19,208 --> 02:14:21,460
are two great epics of the world

1949
02:14:22,792 --> 02:14:25,084
These two elements are the inspiration 
for all great stories

1950
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:32,876
As per our stayion records,

1951
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,376
he served in this station,

1952
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:35,832
till his retirement.

1953
02:14:36,460 --> 02:14:38,460
Then he settled in Madikeri, people say.

1954
02:14:38,624 --> 02:14:39,460
Afterwards, I don't know sir.

1955
02:14:42,416 --> 02:14:44,668
Okay, we will take leave.

1956
02:14:51,668 --> 02:14:54,460
It is not Malgudi that you want to see,

1957
02:14:54,916 --> 02:14:56,124
it’s Lineta! Isn't it?

1958
02:14:59,124 --> 02:15:01,000
After listening to your story,

1959
02:15:01,168 --> 02:15:03,000
I feel, I should meet Lineta

1960
02:15:06,708 --> 02:15:08,584
No, we will go back,

1961
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:10,708
there is no point in searching for her.

1962
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:22,000
Lineta..

1963
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,168
I am leaving,

1964
02:15:25,332 --> 02:15:26,292
I am leaving this town..

1965
02:15:26,916 --> 02:15:27,708
If I continue to stay here,

1966
02:15:28,376 --> 02:15:29,624
they will kill me.

1967
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:30,708
I do not want to die,

1968
02:15:30,832 --> 02:15:31,876
I want to live..

1969
02:15:32,084 --> 02:15:32,876
I will leave now.

1970
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:36,124
No, no, I am not leaving you;

1971
02:15:36,252 --> 02:15:37,208
I will not go, leaving you.

1972
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:39,376
I’ll be back in 2-3 days, whereever I go.

1973
02:15:39,584 --> 02:15:40,376
I will be back.

1974
02:15:40,376 --> 02:15:41,460
I will come back for you.

1975
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:42,540
I promise by you Lineta.

1976
02:15:45,084 --> 02:15:47,752
You will wait for me, till I come, is it?

1977
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:50,832
I will come Lineta..

1978
02:15:50,916 --> 02:15:51,708
I will definitely come

1979
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:53,460
will definitely come Lineta, 
I will definitely come

1980
02:16:02,584 --> 02:16:07,832
It is true that I wanted to see her and 
apologise for my mistakes.

1981
02:16:09,832 --> 02:16:12,252
But even after searching fso much, 
we failed to trace her means,

1982
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,500
she can not be traced.

1983
02:16:27,752 --> 02:16:28,460
We will leave Avinash..

1984
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:29,708
Your garden is really beautiful.

1985
02:16:29,752 --> 02:16:30,500
I felt very happy.

1986
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:32,084
Thank you, it is just a hobby.

1987
02:16:32,124 --> 02:16:35,376
This house, atmosphere, your hospitality.. 
- Will you teach me too?

1988
02:16:35,416 --> 02:16:36,584
everything made me very happy 
- Sure

1989
02:16:36,624 --> 02:16:37,416
We will take leave of you.

1990
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:38,540
It’s our duty sir.

1991
02:16:38,584 --> 02:16:41,460
Next time when you come to Malgudi, 
you must come to our home to stay

1992
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:42,540
Sure.

1993
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:43,668
Prakruti,

1994
02:16:43,668 --> 02:16:46,332
if you do not invite me for your marriage, 
I will kill you!

1995
02:16:46,416 --> 02:16:48,124
Both of you must come a week ahead.

1996
02:16:48,376 --> 02:16:50,752
Why a week, we will come a month in advance.

1997
02:16:51,292 --> 02:16:51,752
Oh,

1998
02:16:51,792 --> 02:16:52,752
Hello sir

1999
02:16:52,832 --> 02:16:53,460
Hello,

2000
02:16:54,584 --> 02:16:56,624
Hello, Mr Lakshminarayana, 
- Hello

2001
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:58,668
I am the head master of Malgudi school

2002
02:16:58,832 --> 02:17:00,584
Oh! Hello..

2003
02:17:01,124 --> 02:17:02,668
I knew that you are in town,

2004
02:17:02,792 --> 02:17:04,460
so I came to meet you

2005
02:17:04,624 --> 02:17:06,168
So glad..

2006
02:17:06,332 --> 02:17:08,584
I had actually come to the school.

2007
02:17:08,792 --> 02:17:10,540
I came to know, peon told me

2008
02:17:10,792 --> 02:17:11,668
Tomorrow afternoon

2009
02:17:11,708 --> 02:17:13,960
we are celebrating our school day.

2010
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:14,376
Nice.

2011
02:17:14,416 --> 02:17:15,416
It is the school where you have studied.

2012
02:17:15,876 --> 02:17:17,208
You are in town..

2013
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,540
On behalf of the School,

2014
02:17:20,624 --> 02:17:22,752
we want to felicitate you.

2015
02:17:22,792 --> 02:17:23,668
No, no please.

2016
02:17:23,668 --> 02:17:25,252
I am not a person who desires such things..

2017
02:17:25,916 --> 02:17:27,168
Sir, let’s go.

2018
02:17:27,416 --> 02:17:30,208
School day, children, atmosphere .. 
everything will be great fun.

2019
02:17:30,416 --> 02:17:32,332
But we have to go back to Bengaluru now

2020
02:17:32,376 --> 02:17:33,960
Sir, apart from that,

2021
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:37,292
the person felicitating you is very special.

2022
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:40,208
Special guest to felicitate..

2023
02:17:40,292 --> 02:17:41,084
who could that be?

2024
02:17:51,376 --> 02:17:52,668
Some old man it seems,

2025
02:17:52,708 --> 02:17:53,876
he has a flashback it seems,

2026
02:17:53,876 --> 02:17:55,168
they are searching it..

2027
02:17:55,376 --> 02:17:56,624
how stupid are they?

2028
02:17:56,916 --> 02:17:58,624
phew, to hell with us.

2029
02:17:58,792 --> 02:18:00,292
Even that old man has a flashback!

2030
02:18:01,124 --> 02:18:02,540
we are just sitting here doing nothing..

2031
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:05,500
Rita, want to join me for coffee?

2032
02:18:06,124 --> 02:18:07,376
you will get till my chappal tears..

2033
02:18:07,668 --> 02:18:08,792
I can’t pay for that.

2034
02:18:09,084 --> 02:18:10,124
Will pay only for coffee.

2035
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:13,332
Dude, chappal costs 500 bugs.

2036
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:15,376
That is why, we are sitting like this.

2037
02:18:16,084 --> 02:18:16,708
What dude?

2038
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,960
On behalf of the people of Malgudi,

2039
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,040
we are felicitating a litterateur today.

2040
02:18:24,084 --> 02:18:27,040
Another special person, who felicitates him was,

2041
02:18:27,084 --> 02:18:30,960
guide and was light of Lakshminayana's life.

2042
02:18:35,460 --> 02:18:36,584
Madam, please come.

2043
02:19:04,084 --> 02:19:05,252
Saraswati teacher,

2044
02:19:05,376 --> 02:19:08,500
she was Lakshminarayana Malgudi’s teacher ,

2045
02:19:08,752 --> 02:19:11,376
and inspiration to all his writings.

2046
02:19:15,460 --> 02:19:20,252
Today, this stage has witnessed a rare reunion.

2047
02:19:40,668 --> 02:19:42,792
I have now realized

2048
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,124
I have fogotten my town,

2049
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:47,792
my school,

2050
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:53,416
my people..

2051
02:19:54,332 --> 02:19:57,084
If I had not come back here,

2052
02:19:59,792 --> 02:20:01,292
my life would have been a waste.

2053
02:20:03,168 --> 02:20:05,460
Today if I have written something,

2054
02:20:07,168 --> 02:20:09,460
our Saraswati teacher is behind it.

2055
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,792
I am reminded of a poem on this occasion.

2056
02:20:17,624 --> 02:20:19,752
In the book of thousand memories

2057
02:20:19,792 --> 02:20:21,752
Memory of childhood being the first line

2058
02:20:23,832 --> 02:20:25,500
Book is spread with childhood mischiefs

2059
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,624
Falling, getting up, running, studying..

2060
02:20:32,208 --> 02:20:34,084
Those memories of being back again,

2061
02:20:36,752 --> 02:20:38,540
Another childhood has to return again..

2062
02:20:40,876 --> 02:20:42,584
to complete the mischief that was balance

2063
02:20:42,708 --> 02:20:44,084
to learn, to teach

2064
02:20:46,332 --> 02:20:48,252
But can childhood be back again?

2065
02:20:50,376 --> 02:20:52,500
Time has gone past us.

2066
02:20:54,252 --> 02:20:56,040
only remembrance in front of us

2067
02:20:59,208 --> 02:21:00,252
Jai Kannada.

2068
02:21:01,332 --> 02:21:04,332
Cultural programmes will commence now.

2069
02:21:04,416 --> 02:21:13,168
First up is a folk dance that mirrors the culture of Malnad, 
by 8th standard students

2070
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,124
When others spoke high about you,

2071
02:21:39,416 --> 02:21:41,500
I was feeling proud, you know?

2072
02:21:42,252 --> 02:21:43,876
I am so glad you came back.

2073
02:21:47,168 --> 02:21:48,500
By the way,

2074
02:21:48,876 --> 02:21:50,624
what is Lineta up to?

2075
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,460
Look how he is blushing.

2076
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:00,460
blushing?

2077
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:01,168
Yes, you are.

2078
02:22:01,416 --> 02:22:03,124
Why would I?

2079
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:06,624
We searched a lot madam,

2080
02:22:06,668 --> 02:22:07,708
but we could not find her anywhere.

2081
02:22:08,832 --> 02:22:10,124
That story is over.

2082
02:22:12,084 --> 02:22:13,460
I am very happy to be back here.

2083
02:22:14,376 --> 02:22:17,084
More than anything, 
I’m happy that I got to meet you.

2084
02:22:19,084 --> 02:22:21,832
Sir, shall we capture this moment in a selfie?

2085
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:29,292
Aarti, a 9th standard student, 
will now sing the song `Kaanada Kadalige hambaliside Maana'

2086
02:22:45,584 --> 02:22:55,708
Sometimes in the pages we don't mind reading itself , 
there will be the answeres we search for

2087
02:23:12,208 --> 02:23:12,668
Hello,

2088
02:23:12,792 --> 02:23:15,168
Hello, am I talking to Prakruti?

2089
02:23:15,168 --> 02:23:15,500
Yes..

2090
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:18,124
Are you looking for Lineta?

2091
02:23:18,252 --> 02:23:18,668
Yes.

2092
02:23:19,292 --> 02:23:20,252
May I know who you are?

2093
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:21,624
I’m Shruti,

2094
02:23:21,752 --> 02:23:24,960
daughter of Lakshminarayana Malgudi’s 
school friend, Vimala.

2095
02:23:25,208 --> 02:23:28,916
My friend had shared the post 
you had uploaded on face book.

2096
02:23:29,168 --> 02:23:30,376
I saw that and called you.

2097
02:23:30,708 --> 02:23:32,124
Nice, tell me.

2098
02:23:32,376 --> 02:23:34,168
Actually Lineta is alive.

2099
02:23:34,208 --> 02:23:34,832
Really?

2100
02:23:35,792 --> 02:23:36,500
Where is she?

2101
02:23:37,124 --> 02:23:38,832
She is in Malgudi only.

2102
02:23:40,332 --> 02:23:42,252
Lineta is in Malgudi only it seems

2103
02:23:43,416 --> 02:23:44,916
Lineta is in Malgudi?

2104
02:23:44,916 --> 02:23:45,376
Yes.

2105
02:23:45,584 --> 02:23:46,916
But we have looked around everywhere.

2106
02:23:47,124 --> 02:23:48,708
Someone must be fooling around with you.

2107
02:23:49,252 --> 02:23:51,040
You please tell me, where is she in Malgudi?

2108
02:23:51,292 --> 02:23:52,708
I will send you the address.

2109
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,124
Thank You. Thank You so much.

2110
02:23:55,876 --> 02:23:56,460
I kept telling you right

2111
02:23:56,500 --> 02:23:58,292
that we will surely meet her

2112
02:23:58,416 --> 02:23:59,752
It seems, she is in Malgudi only.

2113
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,168
Who told you that?

2114
02:24:01,252 --> 02:24:03,584
Your friend Vimala’s daughter told me.

2115
02:24:04,208 --> 02:24:04,832
Shall we go now?

2116
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:09,624
Okay fine, turn the vehicle.

2117
02:24:13,752 --> 02:24:14,332
Vimala?

2118
02:24:25,876 --> 02:24:26,624
Prakruti?

2119
02:24:27,084 --> 02:24:28,000
Yes,

2120
02:24:28,332 --> 02:24:29,376
I was the one who called you.

2121
02:24:30,084 --> 02:24:31,332
Hi.. 
-Hi..

2122
02:24:31,832 --> 02:24:33,708
Lakshmi.. how are you?

2123
02:24:35,292 --> 02:24:36,376
I’m sorry, I can’t place you

2124
02:24:36,584 --> 02:24:37,292
Vimala..

2125
02:24:37,832 --> 02:24:38,708
Malgudi school?

2126
02:24:39,792 --> 02:24:41,668
Oh! yes.

2127
02:24:41,832 --> 02:24:43,040
Where is Lineta?

2128
02:24:43,792 --> 02:24:44,584
She is inside.

2129
02:25:56,752 --> 02:25:58,416
Li, Li, Lineta,

2130
02:26:02,668 --> 02:26:04,168
Lineta, look here,

2131
02:26:07,752 --> 02:26:08,916
It’s me Lakshminarayana

2132
02:26:13,332 --> 02:26:17,708
I, your Lakshmi is here.

2133
02:26:19,916 --> 02:26:20,668
Your Lakshmi.

2134
02:26:24,876 --> 02:26:29,252
I know that you are angry with me

2135
02:26:33,832 --> 02:26:39,416
I am distressed by the fact that 
I did not think of you all these years

2136
02:26:44,876 --> 02:26:46,208
Lineta, I have wronged you

2137
02:26:50,584 --> 02:26:52,500
I told you that I would come back to meet you,

2138
02:26:54,752 --> 02:26:55,540
but I never did.

2139
02:26:58,252 --> 02:26:59,000
I could not come.

2140
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:04,084
I am a sinner.

2141
02:27:08,332 --> 02:27:09,584
I made you wait this long.

2142
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:17,708
Open your eyes and see me once Lineta,

2143
02:27:21,876 --> 02:27:23,208
See your Lakshmi once

2144
02:27:28,876 --> 02:27:29,792
Lineta and I,

2145
02:27:30,668 --> 02:27:33,708
studied together in PUC and degree.

2146
02:27:35,168 --> 02:27:36,752
We two were very close friends.

2147
02:27:38,500 --> 02:27:40,332
When we were in final year degree,

2148
02:27:40,916 --> 02:27:43,500
ignoring her protests,

2149
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:45,500
her father,

2150
02:27:45,752 --> 02:27:50,292
got her married to a soldier from Madikeri, 
as it was a good alliance.

2151
02:27:53,332 --> 02:27:54,376
Her bad luck,

2152
02:27:55,332 --> 02:27:57,252
within a month of their marriage,

2153
02:27:57,916 --> 02:28:00,416
her husband died in the war.

2154
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:04,124
She was very upset.

2155
02:28:05,916 --> 02:28:07,668
Till her father was alive,

2156
02:28:08,376 --> 02:28:10,000
she was in Madikeri.

2157
02:28:12,252 --> 02:28:13,084
Then,

2158
02:28:14,252 --> 02:28:15,668
You know, what did she told me?

2159
02:28:16,752 --> 02:28:19,376
`Take me to Malgudi..

2160
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:24,332
Lakshmi will come there searching for me..

2161
02:28:25,584 --> 02:28:26,960
I want to see him!'

2162
02:28:27,708 --> 02:28:28,668
she insisted to do so.

2163
02:28:31,668 --> 02:28:36,252
Her last desire was to meet you.

2164
02:28:45,124 --> 02:28:46,332
It is ten years,

2165
02:28:46,876 --> 02:28:48,416
she has not recognised anybody.

2166
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:54,668
You should have somehow tried to contact me and

2167
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:56,708
informed me.

2168
02:28:57,540 --> 02:28:58,792
I did consider that,

2169
02:29:00,124 --> 02:29:01,000
But she said,

2170
02:29:02,208 --> 02:29:06,668
`Lakshmi will remember me on his own..

2171
02:29:09,832 --> 02:29:16,332
He will surely come looking for me someday 
if he loves me'

2172
02:29:24,916 --> 02:29:27,792
And here you are finally as she wished.

2173
02:29:28,668 --> 02:29:32,124
If she was conscious she would have been the happiest..

2174
02:29:33,252 --> 02:29:38,708
As if the tears rolling down your cheeks

2175
02:29:39,416 --> 02:29:44,752
are waiting for the finger

2176
02:29:46,084 --> 02:29:51,084
The first silent words

2177
02:29:51,668 --> 02:29:57,752
Are searching for the shore

2178
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:04,916
I beg your pardon

2179
02:30:05,332 --> 02:30:10,624
In rebirth I will

2180
02:30:10,708 --> 02:30:17,500
be born as your friend,

2181
02:30:18,252 --> 02:30:24,876
we will meet, forgive me for everything

2182
02:30:59,708 --> 02:31:05,792
Like the pen that wrote a story

2183
02:31:05,876 --> 02:31:11,252
forgetting the very first line

2184
02:31:11,376 --> 02:31:18,332
Fond memories have almost faded away

2185
02:31:18,460 --> 02:31:23,832
Death comes flowing like a stream

2186
02:31:25,252 --> 02:31:30,876
The forgotten breath

2187
02:31:31,292 --> 02:31:36,916
seems to say something

2188
02:31:38,124 --> 02:31:44,708
Let the final line be

2189
02:31:44,752 --> 02:31:50,292
I will meet you again

2190
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:55,792
As if the tears rolling down your cheeks

2191
02:31:56,876 --> 02:32:02,208
are waiting for the finger

2192
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:09,668
The last silent words

2193
02:32:09,876 --> 02:32:16,460
I will meet you again..

2194
02:32:16,752 --> 02:32:18,000
Lineta,

2195
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:23,960
Memories are like old clothes.

2196
02:33:24,376 --> 02:33:25,460
They may be old now.

2197
02:33:26,332 --> 02:33:28,000
But they were new once.

2198
02:33:28,376 --> 02:33:30,752
This may not be just the story of 
Lakshminarayana Malgudi's memories

2199
02:33:31,752 --> 02:33:33,168
It could be your story too.

2200
02:33:34,584 --> 02:33:36,000
This could be your childhood story ,

2201
02:33:36,752 --> 02:33:38,208
The story of your town,

2202
02:33:38,792 --> 02:33:41,040
It's just that in Lineta's place, 
somebody else may be waiting..

2203
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:43,000
Instead of Lakshmi,

2204
02:33:43,084 --> 02:33:44,500
somebody else will be searching..

2205
02:33:45,584 --> 02:33:46,416
Look around once..

2206
02:33:47,332 --> 02:33:49,668
real love and affection is all around you ..

2207
02:33:50,584 --> 02:33:53,168
Don't forget those who have you loved you
