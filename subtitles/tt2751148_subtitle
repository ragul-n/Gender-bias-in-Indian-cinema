1
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:25,755
The love crazy Meera . . .

2
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:32,283
a trinity of love, worship, and faith . . .

3
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:39,283
lived all her life worshiping Girdhar Gopal.

4
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:46,157
From the age of five till her last breath . . .

5
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:49,279
she kept craving for her unseen beloved.

6
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:56,760
Maybe that is why her dried tears turned her land of birth . . .

7
00:01:57,287 --> 00:02:02,759
her land of love, Rajasthan, into a land of dry sands.

8
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:08,758
She made everyone there devoted to Shyam.

9
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:16,760
Her unique love brimmed with such devotion . . .

10
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:23,760
it is carrying along devotees in its stream since the last five centuries.

11
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:31,765
And will continue to do so for aeons.

12
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:00,754
''Whatever this world may say''

13
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:04,757
''However it may weigh love''

14
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:22,757
''So what if I am away from you''

15
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,278
''Only your image floats in my eyes''

16
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:32,763
''Shyam, Shyam, O my Shyam''

17
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:45,280
''O my Shyam, Ghanshyam''

18
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:19,762
''I have not seen any dawn''

19
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:26,762
''The world has given me such darkness''

20
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:55,759
''I don't know what to do''

21
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:59,278
''If the world is bad''

22
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,759
''Cry in private''

23
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:06,757
''So what if I am far away from you?''

24
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:10,005
''Only your image floats in my eyes''

25
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:16,282
''Shyam, Shyam, O my Shyam''

26
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:29,280
''O my Shyam, Ghanshyam''

27
00:05:54,086 --> 00:06:00,276
''How do I say I adore him?''

28
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:07,282
''How do I hide even if I want to?''

29
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:35,282
''My state is such, that I am restless''

30
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:42,286
''Why is the world spewing poison, let what has to happen, happen now''

31
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:47,165
''So what if I am far away from you?''

32
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:50,005
''Only your image floats in my eyes''

33
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:56,282
''Shyam, Shyam, O my Shyam''

34
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:09,280
''O my Shyam, Ghanshyam''

35
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:09,760
Oh great! My daughter gets up early.

36
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:16,282
What can I do, grandpa? My Girdhar gets up early.

37
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:19,759
You only tell me, how can I sleep then?

38
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:22,277
Is it? - Yes.

39
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:28,762
I have to do so much for him. Bathe him, apply sandal wood paste. . .

40
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,759
dress him up, offer oblation.

41
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:39,276
Girdhar has domesticated my little daughter.

42
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:46,764
That's true. Now go, I have to arrange oblation for Girdhar.

43
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,759
If I get late, he will get angry.

44
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:53,278
What will I do then?

45
00:08:54,287 --> 00:09:02,285
Okay, I am leaving. But I had come to tell what my Meera would like to hear.

46
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:06,282
If it is what Girdhar wants to hear, say it.

47
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:12,759
Today is the festival of Girdhar's dance with maidens.

48
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:13,875
Really grandpa?

49
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:15,278
''Like Radha got Kishin''

50
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:20,281
''My heart desires even I get a beau like him''

51
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,759
''I dance with joy''

52
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:35,760
''The flute plays, the drums play, the dot shines on my forehead''

53
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:39,278
''Like Radha got Kishin''

54
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:14,761
''My heart will bloom''

55
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:21,282
''I will find my dreamworld''

56
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:29,282
''My anklets tinkle''

57
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,759
''Even my heart is rejoicing today''

58
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:36,757
''I dance with joy . . . ''

59
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:21,280
''Even I will be a bride one day''

60
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:29,280
''I will wear the veil and sit in a palanquin''

61
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:37,282
''My bangles ring''

62
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,759
''My earrings swing slowly''

63
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:44,278
''I dance with joy . . . ''

64
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:10,761
We are very fortunate that you sanctified our estate . . .

65
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:14,276
with the touch of the sacred Girdhar . . .

66
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:18,279
and also blessed me and my subjects with the viewing of today's festival.

67
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:24,754
It is all thanks to Girdhar Gopal.

68
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,759
This performance was not pre-planned.

69
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,281
We were going to Vrindavan.

70
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,758
Girdhar inspired us to stop here.

71
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,759
One's life is accomplished only by his blessing and inspiration.

72
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:43,759
Acharya, I want to ask you something. - Yes?

73
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:52,763
Meera is a little girl, but she is always lost in the worship of Girdhar.

74
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:58,759
I tried my best, but could not divert her attention.

75
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,998
Can the heart be separated from the body?

76
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:05,084
I don't understand.

77
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:08,677
If Girdhar wishes, you will understand very soon.

78
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:10,766
I take your leave.

79
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:28,276
My Girdhar Gopal !

80
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:53,285
Where are you, Girdhar Gopal? Where did you leave me and go?

81
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,278
My darling !

82
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:06,757
Girdhar Gopal left us, grandpa.

83
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:13,681
Acharya must have taken Girdhar's idol along with the other idols by mistake.

84
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:19,759
It will come back. Don't cry. - No, I want Girdhar Gopal.

85
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,278
The idol will come back.

86
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,281
Girdhar Gopal, you will have to come back.

87
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:10,757
Madhav, how far have we come from Maidta?

88
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:16,759
Only a furlong. - Madav, stop the cart.

89
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:18,766
As you wish.

90
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:21,276
Hail Lord Krishna !

91
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,278
Girdhar Gopal, you will have to come back.

92
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:10,758
Acharya, you? - I had to come back, Raoji.

93
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:15,759
You will remember, I told you something that day.

94
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,006
That the heart cannot be separated from the body.

95
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:25,999
Yes, but I had not understood what you meant.

96
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:29,278
Come, you will even understand that today.

97
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,276
Meera.

98
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:40,278
Girdhar Gopal, you will have to come back.

99
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:41,355
Oh God !

100
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:52,284
Meera, look who is here.

101
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,759
Meera, Acharya has come.

102
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,278
Acharya, where is my Girdhar Gopal?

103
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:07,278
He is always close to you, dear.

104
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:18,755
Take, my little Radha.

105
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:28,284
You came back? You had to come back. Let me see where you run and go now.

106
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:33,164
Will you be able to carry it? Shall I keep it in the temple for you?

107
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:41,763
I can carry it. If I don't carry him, who will carry my Girdhar Gopal?

108
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:47,759
Alright, take it carefully. Hold here. Go.

109
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:53,279
Girdhar, don't ever leave me and go again.

110
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:58,278
I understand what you said that day now, Acharya.

111
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:03,282
Meera has become a part of Girdhar.

112
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,282
Truly, no one can separate Meera from Girdhar.

113
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:12,758
Then why don't you surrender Meera to Girdhar &amp; stop worrying about her?

114
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:19,278
There is no time to think now.

115
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,755
This kid born as your granddaughter . . .

116
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:28,282
is one of the infinite beloveds of Girdhar, a form of Radha.

117
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:31,756
Yes.

118
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:07,759
O Girdhar Gopal, I hand over Meera to you.

119
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:12,758
Your devotee has become free of responsibility forever.

120
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:18,285
Meera belongs to you from now.

121
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:20,766
She belongs to Girdhar Gopal.

122
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:06,280
''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me''

123
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:26,283
''How do I live without him?''

124
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:30,759
''I have to live and die with him''

125
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:36,280
''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me . . . ''

126
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:28,758
''I don't feel at peace even for a moment''

127
00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:33,758
''My eyes don't like anyone else''

128
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:53,285
''He has such an innocent face''

129
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:57,759
''That no one else impresses my heart''

130
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:04,283
''Don't leave me and go''

131
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:17,758
''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me . . . ''

132
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:26,283
''How desperate I am, I cannot say''

133
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:30,759
''If I don't see you, I feel restless''

134
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:50,758
''I don't care if I lose the world''

135
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:55,279
''But I will not be able to tolerate separation from him''

136
00:24:55,767 --> 00:25:01,285
''Don't ever leave me and go''

137
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:14,758
''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me . . . ''

138
00:25:54,767 --> 00:26:01,286
' Girdhar, you are my Prince'

139
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:05,282
' Don't ever leave me'

140
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,758
Meera, O crazy lover!

141
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:12,278
Good you came, Lalita. I'll recite a new couplet to you.

142
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:14,756
He just gave it to me.

143
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,283
I will hear the couplet, first you listen to me.

144
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:23,156
What is it that has become even more important than my Girdhar's couplet?

145
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:26,677
Okay, tell me. - Your father has come.

146
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:29,998
I heard your uncle has called him specially.

147
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:31,276
So?

148
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:33,675
The moment he came, they went into discussion in a room.

149
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:34,756
So?

150
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,684
What so? You are always lost in Girdhar.

151
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,758
You just don't care what's going on in the world.

152
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:41,285
Why should I worry?

153
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:45,279
Alright, but your father has come after so many days.

154
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:49,041
Won't you meet him? - Shall I tell you the truth, friend?

155
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:54,759
Except Girdhar, I don't even feel like meeting anyone now.

156
00:26:57,287 --> 00:27:02,998
If father was alive today, he would be pleased to hear this news.

157
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:09,283
Yes brother, father only brought up Meera, gave her an education.

158
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:12,280
I am her father only in name.

159
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:16,006
Meera is our most favourite daughter, Rattan.

160
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,755
When I got this message of Rana Sangram Singh . . .

161
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:22,764
I could not believe it for a moment.

162
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:29,759
Because he has even proposed to make you the chief of Mewad.

163
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:35,279
Yes. He must have made the proposal after due thought.

164
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,757
The throne of Chittor is the prestige of the Rajputanas.

165
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:43,757
Likewise, even our Rathod clan is the prestige of the Rajputs.

166
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:49,279
The estate of Maidta may be small, but we are not small in our bravery.

167
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:56,283
Yes, but what we have to think about is by building ties with us . . .

168
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,755
is the Rana of Mewad playing some political game?

169
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:03,279
I have heard a lot of politics is being played in Chittor.

170
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:07,278
There are differences even between the Queens there.

171
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,278
Will our Meera have any . . .

172
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:13,755
No one can change what is destined, brother.

173
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:18,282
But if we build ties and make Mewad stronger . . .

174
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:21,280
it will be in the interest of the Rajputanas.

175
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:27,760
So even you wish that we accept Rana's proposal?

176
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:30,278
And send him our consent? - Yes brother.

177
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:34,759
I think we must consult Meera once in this matter.

178
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:40,759
What are you saying, brother! After father, Meera has grown up under you.

179
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,278
Whatever you do will be in her interest.

180
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:45,675
She cannot refuse you.

181
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:49,759
Alright, then I'll send our consent to Rana.

182
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:52,278
Come. - Yes brother.

183
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:11,759
Respected Rana, the pride of the Rajputs . . .

184
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,758
the scion of the Surya clan . . .

185
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:21,758
the King of Mewad, Rana Sangram Singh . . .

186
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,759
Viramdev Rao of Maidta sends his greetings.

187
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:27,759
You have honoured us Rathods of Maidta, . . .

188
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:29,763
by asking for our daughter's hand in marriage.

189
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:33,674
We are grateful to you for it. We give our consent to your proposal.

190
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:37,282
Fix an auspicious date and inform us. Yours, Rao Viramdev.

191
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:45,760
Minister, I am pleased that Rao Viramdev accepted our proposal.

192
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:49,996
But Ranaji, Maidta is a small estate of 360 village.

193
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:53,278
And Meera's father is the chief of only 12 villages

194
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:56,278
But building ties with them, the prestige of Mewad . . .

195
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,765
Is getting a boost, minister.

196
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:04,760
I am confident that the daughter of Maidta will be my daughter-in-law. . .

197
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,759
and even their sword will become our friend.

198
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,759
Ask the priest to give us an auspicious date.

199
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:18,759
I'd myself like to go to Maidta and perform the rituals.

200
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:21,278
As you wish, Ranaji.

201
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:38,760
Did you hear correctly, Uda? - Now hear this!

202
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:43,278
You think your daughter has gone deaf?

203
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:46,278
It's not that.

204
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:53,759
What I'm surprised about is that without consulting me . . .

205
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:59,760
Rana fixed Bhojraj's alliance with the daughter of Maidta.

206
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:04,283
Watch what happens next.

207
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:17,278
The alliance is being fixed today. The marriage will happen tomorrow.

208
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:22,758
Next, Bhojraj will take the throne.

209
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:28,280
And then, we all will be thrown out of the palace.

210
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:36,282
Everything is possible.

211
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:44,280
What is this, Vikram? You cannot even stand properly.

212
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:49,759
When his heart is on fire, this is the only way to douse it.

213
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:56,280
Poor brother! - Don't call me poor!

214
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,675
the throne will go to this worthless son.

215
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:12,286
Bless you, Vikram. Your sister and my hopes are pinned on you.

216
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:16,755
The day you become King. . .

217
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:21,279
your mother will become the Queen Mother.

218
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:26,760
And what will become of your sister, Future King?

219
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:33,759
Whatever you wish. Let me become King first.

220
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:39,758
Why do you worry? The throne is yours.

221
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:48,285
Whatever hurdle comes in your way is sure to be crushed.

222
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:52,278
Wish your words come true, sister.

223
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:57,756
Careful, brother.

224
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:17,762
Sir. . . - How dare you show that to me!

225
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:20,276
I'm dead !

226
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:29,759
My Master, first hit me with this.

227
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:34,758
That's okay, but why have you covered your face?

228
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:42,278
What happened to you? - First beat me with this, sir.

229
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:43,756
Beat me.

230
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,758
Enough sir! - Now tell me what happened.

231
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:56,758
I could not do the job you assigned me. - What!

232
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:04,759
I went to the ladies quarters wearing a veil, to give your message to Champa.

233
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:09,599
But the maids recognised me and hit me . . .

234
00:34:09,686 --> 00:34:11,757
with whatever they could lay their hands on.

235
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:18,759
Some with a broom, some with a stick, and some with shoes.

236
00:34:19,286 --> 00:34:24,759
Not only that, they even said that if ever I go to their quarters . . .

237
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:30,280
wearing a veil, they will behead me.

238
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:37,759
But by your grace, your Dayaram Panda's life was saved.

239
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:43,286
That means from tomorrow, I'll have to make some other arrangement.

240
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:48,757
No sir, I'll arrange Champa for you.

241
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:52,278
But without wearing the veil. Okay sir.

242
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:08,278
' Dwell in my eyes, Nandlal'

243
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:12,278
' You, who holds the flute to your lips'

244
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:15,754
' And wears a garland of flowers round your neck'

245
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:19,278
' Dwell in my eyes, Nandlal'

246
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,754
Why are you panting, Lalita?

247
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:29,286
For who are the cannons being fired? - In honour of Rana Sangram Singh.

248
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,677
Do you know, he is coming with the marriage token.

249
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,759
Your marriage has been fixed with Prince Bhojraj.

250
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:45,761
What? My marriage? But my marriage has been fixed in my childhood . . .

251
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:47,275
with Girdhar Gopal.

252
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:54,000
No, these cannons are not being fired in anyone's honour . . .

253
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:58,757
but to kill someone's husband.

254
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:01,754
This is not possible!

255
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:09,282
Grandpa ! Grandpa, look what is happening.

256
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:12,754
How can such a disaster take place?

257
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:17,756
The forehead that already shines with someone else's vermilion . . .

258
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:22,759
isn't it injustice to apply another man's vermilion on the same forehead?

259
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:24,275
Isn't it a sin?

260
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:31,762
Answer me, grandpa. Speak! Why don't you speak?

261
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:36,759
Don't you remember that you only had surrendered me to Girdhar?

262
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:40,280
You only had made me his wife.

263
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:43,758
Speak grandpa !

264
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:48,279
Don't you remember anything? Anything?

265
00:36:57,766 --> 00:37:01,679
I remember, dear. I remember everything.

266
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:07,284
Really grandpa? Then stop this disaster from happening.

267
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:10,757
Please stop it. - This is not a disaster, dear.

268
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:13,754
It is normal societal norm.

269
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:18,518
Every girl gets married. Even you will.

270
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:24,280
That means you don't remember anything, grandpa.

271
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:28,759
It is you who is forgetting, dear. Because you were very little then.

272
00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:33,757
Acharya had told me a strange secret.

273
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:37,766
He told me you are one of Krishna's infinite beloveds . . .

274
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:39,286
a form of Radha. And. . .

275
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:44,760
And despite knowing this, this injustice is being done to me?

276
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:50,759
It is not injustice, dear. Even Radha was Krishna's friend like you.

277
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:55,284
She was his beloved. She totally belonged to Girdhar.

278
00:37:55,367 --> 00:38:00,760
She didn't marry Girdhar, but someone else.

279
00:38:01,286 --> 00:38:03,754
Her heart always belonged to Girdhar.

280
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,760
And physically, she belonged to her husband.

281
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:11,762
Even your heart can always belong to Gopal after marriage.

282
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:16,284
So is this your order? - Not order dear, it is my blessing.

283
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,757
May you be blessed. May you always be happy.

284
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:35,757
I looked for you everywhere. What are you doing here, dear?

285
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:42,759
I was seeking grandpa's blessing for a good beginning to my new life.

286
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:56,759
I know dear, how much a girl misses her mother on such occasions.

287
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:03,756
If your mother was alive today . . .

288
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:13,757
Grandpa and uncle's love never let me miss anything.

289
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,277
You sired me.

290
00:39:19,286 --> 00:39:23,279
But it is the land of Maidta that gave me my culture.

291
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:25,278
Don't say that, dear.

292
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:30,279
Ratan had sent you to Maidta with a heavy heart.

293
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:36,280
He is so unfortunate, death snatched his wife from him.

294
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,759
Circumstances separated his only child from him.

295
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:51,283
He didn't see your childhood, but yes, he'll now see you married.

296
00:39:58,286 --> 00:40:01,278
Be happy wherever you are.

297
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:10,759
Uncle, I will get married, but you give me a promise.

298
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:11,763
Tell me, dear.

299
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:17,279
Don't ever separate me from my Girdhar Gopal.

300
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:23,759
Take my life if you like, but don't ever separate me from Girdhar Gopal.

301
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:29,081
I am sure Rana will not have any problem about that.

302
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:56,759
''Leaving her parents home, the maiden will join her husband''

303
00:40:57,007 --> 00:41:02,286
''When her husband comes to meet her, she will shy away under her veil''

304
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:21,682
''She will get so much love, she will forget us''

305
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:29,280
''Leaving her parents home . . . ''

306
00:42:08,286 --> 00:42:12,757
''Wherever I may go . . . ''

307
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:17,757
''always be with me, Girdhar''

308
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:36,279
''I don't know anyone else''

309
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:40,759
''I belong to you in my every life''

310
00:42:51,286 --> 00:43:00,285
''I cannot live without you even for a moment, what do I do?''

311
00:43:00,766 --> 00:43:04,759
''Wherever I may go . . . ''

312
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:09,279
''always be with me, Girdhar''

313
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:53,762
''Why are you crying, send her away''

314
00:43:54,766 --> 00:44:00,762
''A daughter has to leave one day''

315
00:44:22,766 --> 00:44:28,762
''I had to hide the pain in my heart''

316
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:35,764
''I didn't want to leave, but I had to''

317
00:44:57,286 --> 00:44:58,275
My dear.

318
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:08,763
Prince, if my Meera makes any mistake, please forgive her.

319
00:45:10,286 --> 00:45:14,279
Because something may always be amiss in the rearing of a motherless child.

320
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:21,759
Meera is a very naive girl, take care of her.

321
00:45:25,286 --> 00:45:28,278
Why do you worry about me, father?

322
00:45:28,686 --> 00:45:32,759
The one who takes care of me is with me.

323
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:34,755
Him.

324
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:32,759
Queen, you are being called. The prince and his bride has come.

325
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:38,280
Okay! If the bride waits a little, her legs won't break.

326
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:39,755
Go.

327
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:44,755
Come mother.

328
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:54,278
Welcome sister-in-law. - Come, daughter-in-law.

329
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:04,679
Prince, come to the temple first, let's finish the rituals.

330
00:47:04,766 --> 00:47:05,755
Yes.

331
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:08,275
Come bride.

332
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:21,283
Daughter-in-law, why did you stop? - Prince, come along with the bride. . .

333
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:23,765
and worship the family deity.

334
00:47:24,286 --> 00:47:25,765
Come. - No.

335
00:47:28,286 --> 00:47:30,754
What does this refusal mean?

336
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:38,278
Without worshiping the family deity, . . .

337
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:40,756
the bride cannot enter the palace, dear.

338
00:47:41,766 --> 00:47:43,757
Come and worship her.

339
00:47:44,286 --> 00:47:48,757
But. . . but Girdhar Gopal is not in this temple.

340
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:53,757
And I don't worship without the presence of Girdhar Gopal.

341
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:56,754
You worship him everyday.

342
00:47:57,766 --> 00:48:00,759
But this is your first visit to the family deity's temple.

343
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:01,996
Come.

344
00:48:03,286 --> 00:48:05,163
Such stubbornness will not be tolerated here.

345
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:06,275
Not at all !

346
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:11,756
Rana, you only make her understand.

347
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:14,277
Her stubbornness will ruin the family.

348
00:48:16,286 --> 00:48:21,280
Try to understand, sister-in-law. If the family deity gets annoyed . . .

349
00:48:21,686 --> 00:48:26,760
What if my Girdhar gets annoyed? What will I do? Where will I go?

350
00:48:27,286 --> 00:48:29,754
No, I won't be able to bear that.

351
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,759
You will have to offer prayers.

352
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:36,759
Apart from the family deity, no other idol can be installed here.

353
00:48:37,286 --> 00:48:45,762
Meera, I have given you my word. Do what I am saying today.

354
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:52,281
Girdhar Gopal, if my love is true . . .

355
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:57,282
like every prayer I offer, you will be present even in this prayer.

356
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:02,760
Come, Girdhar. Come Shyam Sunder.

357
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:37,280
Hail Lord Krishna ! - Hail Lord Krishna !

358
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:48,284
My Girdhar, you kept my honour.

359
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:54,275
Come.

360
00:50:03,286 --> 00:50:04,765
How did this happen?

361
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:10,760
I think master, instead of a bride, some sorcerer has come into the family.

362
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:13,754
It is a cause for worry for all of us.

363
00:50:17,286 --> 00:50:20,278
You are desperate to go in, brother.

364
00:50:20,527 --> 00:50:24,759
Let him go. Why are you troubling our Prince?

365
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:27,765
How can I let him go without taking my token from him?

366
00:50:28,766 --> 00:50:31,759
I am going to sleep in another room. Good night.

367
00:50:31,887 --> 00:50:35,766
Wait. I am not so stupid to let go off my gift.

368
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:40,278
Give me my gift. - Gift? Take.

369
00:50:43,766 --> 00:50:45,757
Go and sleep in another room.

370
00:50:46,766 --> 00:50:51,760
Let me see how long you can stay away from my beautiful sister-in-law.

371
00:50:53,286 --> 00:50:55,754
I'll give you the gift after I've made you an aunt.

372
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,756
All that later! First give me my token.

373
00:51:02,286 --> 00:51:06,677
Take! - You can go in now.

374
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:07,755
Thank you.

375
00:51:36,286 --> 00:51:39,756
Do you intend to stand here all night, brother?

376
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:49,279
Sister-in-law, make him sit somewhere else atleast for today.

377
00:51:50,286 --> 00:51:51,275
Why?

378
00:51:52,286 --> 00:51:57,759
Why? My brother will answer that for you.

379
00:51:58,286 --> 00:51:59,275
Right brother?

380
00:52:21,286 --> 00:52:25,279
Having got you, I am jealous of my own destiny.

381
00:52:28,286 --> 00:52:34,282
I had never expected to see such a beauty on earth.

382
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:39,759
And that too, so closely.

383
00:52:43,766 --> 00:52:48,282
Uda was right. What has God got to do on the nuptial bed?

384
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,757
Give, I'll keep it over there.

385
00:52:50,887 --> 00:52:54,766
God? No, I am his wife.

386
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:58,756
How can I sleep on this bed without him?

387
00:53:02,086 --> 00:53:04,681
Don't I have a right to sit on this bed?

388
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:08,281
Am I not your husband? - No.

389
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:14,282
' I belong only to Girdhar Gopal, none else'

390
00:53:15,286 --> 00:53:20,679
' One who wears a peacock feather crown, is my husband'

391
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:25,996
And what about the marriage rites you performed with me?

392
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:30,756
My body performed the marriage rites with you.

393
00:53:31,286 --> 00:53:37,680
But my heart has, I don't know since how many years, belonged to Girdhar.

394
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:43,286
This is not the time to joke. - Joke? Joke with my Girdhar?

395
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:46,757
I cannot even imagine it. - Your stubbornness won't be tolerated.

396
00:53:47,286 --> 00:53:53,759
I have every right to be stubborn for my husband.

397
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:56,157
You should have told us this beforehand.

398
00:53:56,286 --> 00:54:02,998
I had said I will not stay away from my Girdhar even for a moment.

399
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:15,759
Wait Prince, why are you leaving? we will leave.

400
00:54:53,286 --> 00:54:56,881
My greetings to Prince Bhojraj.

401
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:58,155
Come Panda. How are you?

402
00:54:58,286 --> 00:55:02,279
On this auspicious occasion, I only need your blessings.

403
00:55:03,286 --> 00:55:04,275
Take.

404
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:08,282
A spell should be such that it leaves one spellbound.

405
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:14,759
One has to bow before miracles.

406
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:18,278
Everyone accepts your wife is great.

407
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:22,758
She is wonderful. That is how devoted one should be.

408
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:24,286
That is how dedicated one should be.

409
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:27,757
Those who were jealous had to bite dust.

410
00:55:35,286 --> 00:55:40,280
That is what I was telling Uda, brother. I am very scared.

411
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:45,282
There is no need to be afraid. We have to think of a solution . . .

412
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:48,278
where we can have the cake and eat it too.

413
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:51,996
Uncle, we have only your support now.

414
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:54,754
We never ever expected anything from Rana.

415
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:59,757
What if this sorcerer puts even him under her spell?

416
00:55:59,887 --> 00:56:03,766
Didn't you see how Rana was bowing faithfully?

417
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:07,756
And the prince? He has a double spell cast on him.

418
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:11,676
One of her beauty, and the other of her mantras.

419
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:17,165
We have to think how, despite this sorcerer . . .

420
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:21,279
we put Vikram on the throne. How to make Rana understand.

421
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:27,759
What will he understand? He brought the girl from Maidta.

422
00:56:28,286 --> 00:56:31,756
He is even planning to make Ratan Singh the Chief of Mewad.

423
00:56:35,007 --> 00:56:39,762
The problem is serious, we must be very careful.

424
00:56:40,286 --> 00:56:44,757
Before the arrow is released and hits bullseye . . .

425
00:56:45,286 --> 00:56:48,278
You will have to think of a solution, uncle.

426
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:52,281
Don't worry, rest assured.

427
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:59,000
Karmavati, I will be worthy of being your brother . . .

428
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:04,282
when I make my nephew, Vikram sit on the Mewad throne.

429
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:10,760
God willing, even that day will come.

430
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:37,279
Why are you laughing so much? What is the matter?

431
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:41,758
Poor brother! - Who are you talking about?

432
00:57:42,286 --> 00:57:47,759
Bhojraj. - Why, what happened to him?

433
00:57:53,286 --> 00:57:57,677
No! - Ask Ramvati.

434
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,757
She actually saw it.

435
00:58:00,286 --> 00:58:03,756
Ramvati, tell her.

436
00:58:04,286 --> 00:58:08,757
Tell mother who sleeps with Meera. - Girdhar.

437
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:15,679
That same magical idol. - Is it?

438
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:35,280
Push harder. . . harder.

439
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:48,279
Stop. . .stop!

440
00:58:52,286 --> 00:58:55,756
Yes mother? - Did Meera apply henna?

441
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,678
What do I say? She is swinging with him.

442
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,756
Tell her we have a festival tomorrow.

443
00:59:04,286 --> 00:59:06,754
We have to even go to the temple after afternoon.Ask her to come &amp; apply henna

444
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:11,279
As you wish. I'll tell her.

445
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:14,759
Leela, apply henna for me.

446
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,755
Lalita, stop.

447
00:59:24,286 --> 00:59:28,279
Sister-in-law, applied henna? I didn't get a good colour.

448
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:30,279
Show me yours.

449
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,277
' Girdhar written all over her hands'

450
01:00:00,086 --> 01:00:03,362
''I will immerse myself in Girdhar's colour''

451
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:11,759
''Even I will be like Radha''

452
01:00:16,286 --> 01:00:19,756
''My home will be in Vrindavan''

453
01:00:20,286 --> 01:00:23,278
''Where I'll live along with my Natwar''

454
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:27,281
''I dance with joy''

455
01:00:27,766 --> 01:00:31,759
''The flute plays, the drums play, the dot shines on my forehead''

456
01:00:32,286 --> 01:00:34,754
''Like Radha got Kishin''

457
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:39,279
''My heart desires even I get a beau like him''

458
01:02:35,286 --> 01:02:38,278
Why are you looking at her like thieves, Bhojraj?

459
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:41,759
She belongs to you, she is your wife.

460
01:02:42,286 --> 01:02:47,759
You have a right over her. Go take your right.

461
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:50,754
Go win your wife's body.

462
01:02:51,286 --> 01:02:56,280
Go Bhojraj. She belongs to you. . .you !

463
01:03:12,286 --> 01:03:13,765
It's probably my imagination.

464
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:36,757
What were you about to do, Bhojraj? You were going to challenge God?

465
01:03:38,286 --> 01:03:40,754
You were going to burn your hands with the rays of the sun?

466
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:48,275
No, Meera doesn't belong to you. She is that sacred pilgrimage . . .

467
01:03:48,766 --> 01:03:54,762
seeing which, worshiping which, sins of several lives can be erased.

468
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,279
Hail Lord Krishna !

469
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:55,686
''I will sit in my beloved's palanquin all dressed up''

470
01:05:55,766 --> 01:06:02,285
''I will belong to my beloved in all my lives''

471
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:20,757
''This dream of mine will come true''

472
01:06:25,286 --> 01:06:29,757
''My eyes will brim with happiness''

473
01:06:30,007 --> 01:06:36,275
''I will sit in my beloved's palanquin all dressed up . . . ''

474
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:22,759
''He will be unique''

475
01:07:25,286 --> 01:07:29,757
''The light of my lonely heart''

476
01:07:32,286 --> 01:07:36,279
''My eyes are desperate''

477
01:07:39,286 --> 01:07:43,279
''To see that innocent face''

478
01:07:46,286 --> 01:07:50,279
''There will only be love in my life''

479
01:07:50,686 --> 01:07:54,281
''Whatever he says will be acceptable to me''

480
01:07:54,766 --> 01:08:01,285
''I will sit in my beloved's palanquin all dressed up . . . ''

481
01:08:35,006 --> 01:08:39,682
''I will win over my mother-in-law's heart''

482
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:46,282
''I will treat my sister-in-law as my sister''

483
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:52,757
''My father-in-law will be very loving''

484
01:08:55,287 --> 01:08:59,757
''I will serve him as my daughter''

485
01:09:02,766 --> 01:09:06,760
''My world will be full of happiness''

486
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:10,996
''Love is what I'll adorn myself with''

487
01:09:11,287 --> 01:09:17,283
''I will sit in my beloved's palanquin all dressed up . . . ''

488
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,757
Master, you have so many maids in your palace.

489
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:43,757
But not one of them who can show some mercy on your Dayaram Panda.

490
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:51,681
Stupid ! A woman loves, she doesn't show mercy.

491
01:10:51,766 --> 01:10:56,282
That is what I am saying. I love so many, but none love me.

492
01:10:56,407 --> 01:11:00,764
You ass! A woman loves only when she sees something in you.

493
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:05,280
The shine of money, machismo.

494
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:08,280
Ask this from Champa.

495
01:11:09,287 --> 01:11:12,757
Okay Master, I am leaving. - Go.

496
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:15,755
Master, I am leaving. - Then go.

497
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:22,759
My feet have got stuck, Master. - You are a rascal !

498
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:25,766
They are free now. I'm leaving.

499
01:11:26,287 --> 01:11:32,760
Listen Dayaram, tell Champa I have called her.

500
01:11:33,287 --> 01:11:35,676
I'll have to go to the women's quarters again?

501
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:40,760
So what? Are you going the first time? Wear a veil and go.

502
01:11:41,287 --> 01:11:44,279
No Master, I will not wear a veil and go.

503
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:50,280
I understand, Master. I'll do something.

504
01:12:32,287 --> 01:12:34,755
Wife! . . .Wife!

505
01:12:37,006 --> 01:12:41,158
Come soon. - Let me clean the temple first.

506
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:43,755
Do that later. Come.

507
01:12:43,886 --> 01:12:47,674
Where are you taking me? - Come, I'll show you a miracle.

508
01:12:47,766 --> 01:12:50,997
Miracle? But what's the hurry?

509
01:12:51,287 --> 01:12:53,755
Come soon. - Wait. Where are you taking me?

510
01:12:58,287 --> 01:13:02,757
Hey! Where did it go? - What?

511
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:08,757
I just saw a huge temple descending from heaven.

512
01:13:10,287 --> 01:13:14,280
And I saw your Girdhar Gopal entering it.

513
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:21,280
But sadly, you could not see it.

514
01:13:22,287 --> 01:13:24,278
Wonder where that strange sight disappeared like a dream.

515
01:13:26,287 --> 01:13:30,280
It has not disappeared, I can still see it.

516
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:35,755
Why can't I see it?

517
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:42,283
Oh, I understood. - What?

518
01:13:43,287 --> 01:13:46,757
That you can see everything with your Girdhar's divine sight.

519
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:52,280
Not everything, only Girdhar Gopal.

520
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:54,757
My eyes see only Girdhar Gopal.

521
01:13:55,287 --> 01:14:00,280
The truth is, they don't even want to see anything else.

522
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:04,760
I have a thought. - What?

523
01:14:05,766 --> 01:14:08,759
I'll get a similar temple built for Girdhar . . .

524
01:14:10,287 --> 01:14:13,757
like the one I saw just now. - Really?

525
01:14:13,886 --> 01:14:14,875
Yes.

526
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:25,284
Prince, any specific reason for bringing me here?

527
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:30,280
Yes Rana, I want your permission.

528
01:14:31,766 --> 01:14:34,280
I want to get a temple made of Girdhar Gopal.

529
01:14:36,087 --> 01:14:39,762
Your daughter-in-law wishes the same.

530
01:14:41,287 --> 01:14:43,278
A temple of Girdhar Gopal?

531
01:14:46,006 --> 01:14:50,284
Alright. If that is what you and daughter-in-law wish . . .

532
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:52,676
I have no objection.

533
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:56,757
But where do you want the temple made?

534
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:04,280
The land over there. - That land?

535
01:15:23,287 --> 01:15:26,279
No, that is not the temple of my imagination.

536
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:30,757
Show me some other design. - Then see this, Prince.

537
01:15:30,886 --> 01:15:33,764
You will surely like this design.

538
01:15:38,287 --> 01:15:43,280
Yes, that's the one! I'll just be back.

539
01:15:45,686 --> 01:15:46,675
Wife.

540
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:51,275
Yes Prince.

541
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:08,286
Look, isn't this the same temple? - Yes, exactly the same.

542
01:16:08,766 --> 01:16:12,282
When will the temple be ready? - Soon.

543
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:16,757
That's what I'll try. Are you happy?

544
01:16:17,287 --> 01:16:22,759
Yes, me, and my Girdhar too. Isn't it?

545
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:36,755
The construction of the temple should be stopped soonest.

546
01:16:38,287 --> 01:16:43,759
How can it be stopped? It is being constructed on the orders of Rana.

547
01:16:44,287 --> 01:16:47,279
Wonder why Rana is pampering sister-in-law's so much.

548
01:16:51,287 --> 01:16:54,757
Whose father has become his right hand man . . .

549
01:16:55,287 --> 01:16:57,755
it is natural he will pamper his daughter.

550
01:16:57,886 --> 01:17:00,764
As it is, the several battles are emptying Chittor's coffers.

551
01:17:00,886 --> 01:17:03,764
Moreover, this temple. Money is being spent lavishly.

552
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:08,280
If this continues, we will have to go begging.

553
01:17:08,766 --> 01:17:14,284
I'd advise you to ask for a separate estate for your children from Rana.

554
01:17:14,766 --> 01:17:18,679
Uncle is right. - But brother. . .

555
01:17:18,766 --> 01:17:23,760
If we get a separate estate, we'll find a way to capture Mewad.

556
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:28,757
Your children are still young. Try to convince Rana.

557
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:32,757
If nothing is done now, Vikram won't get a chance to become Rana.

558
01:17:32,886 --> 01:17:33,875
Yes mother.

559
01:17:34,886 --> 01:17:39,277
Alright, I'll place my demand before Rana today.

560
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:43,279
Just placing a demand won't do. You will have to ensure it is fulfilled.

561
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:49,283
If you show even a little softness our future will be dark.

562
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:52,996
Have faith Vikram, I will try my best.

563
01:17:53,287 --> 01:18:00,284
Queen ! I am surprised how you dared to keep such a proposal before me.

564
01:18:01,287 --> 01:18:05,280
You are aware what all I am doing to consolidate Mewad . . .

565
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:06,766
and strengthen it's unity.

566
01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:11,757
At such a time when we should fight the enemies of Mewad, you. . .

567
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:16,278
you want to divide Mewad?

568
01:18:18,287 --> 01:18:21,164
If Mewad is in trouble. . .

569
01:18:21,287 --> 01:18:27,283
why is the money in our coffers being spent on useless activities?

570
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,755
Is there a dearth of temples in Chittor . . .

571
01:18:31,886 --> 01:18:34,525
that you gave permission for constructing one more temple?

572
01:18:35,287 --> 01:18:38,757
Where the money of Mewad has to be spent . . .

573
01:18:39,766 --> 01:18:43,760
is not your prerogative Queen, it is mine.

574
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:49,282
Alright, then isn't it my prerogative to ensure . . .

575
01:18:50,287 --> 01:18:54,280
the women of Mewad, forgetting their family traditions . . .

576
01:18:54,367 --> 01:18:57,006
crossing the threshold of their homes . . .

577
01:18:57,287 --> 01:19:00,279
not start dancing and singing before people?

578
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:06,761
Oh ! So why don't you clearly say that it is not the temple . . .

579
01:19:07,287 --> 01:19:10,757
but Meera's worship that is bothering you. .

580
01:19:13,287 --> 01:19:17,757
But remember, I have promised her . . .

581
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:21,279
that no one will separate her from her Girdhar Gopal.

582
01:19:23,087 --> 01:19:28,764
If anyone tries to break my promise until I am alive . . .

583
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:33,279
he should also be ready to suffer the consequences.

584
01:19:34,287 --> 01:19:37,279
You understand, Queen?

585
01:19:38,766 --> 01:19:41,759
You can leave now.

586
01:20:18,287 --> 01:20:22,757
Mother, crying won't help you.

587
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:28,280
Think of something, do something.

588
01:20:30,287 --> 01:20:34,757
What do I do, Uda? I don't understand what I should do.

589
01:20:36,287 --> 01:20:42,760
Don't worry Uda, when her brother explains, she'll understand everything.

590
01:20:44,287 --> 01:20:45,766
Come, Mahajan.

591
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:54,755
Greetings Queen.

592
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:03,757
Don't hesitate, sister. He is our well wisher.

593
01:21:04,287 --> 01:21:07,279
He is famous in the whole of Mewad for his wiseness.

594
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:13,155
I suggest that even Vikram follow his advise.

595
01:21:13,287 --> 01:21:16,279
Uncle, I will do as you say.

596
01:21:16,527 --> 01:21:19,757
Mahajan has become our trustworthy advisor from this moment.

597
01:21:20,287 --> 01:21:22,755
So, when can you spare time for us?

598
01:21:22,886 --> 01:21:26,765
Why ask? I am at your service from this moment.

599
01:21:27,766 --> 01:21:33,762
But remember, let Mahajan's coming here remain a secret.

600
01:21:35,287 --> 01:21:39,280
Alright, but what advise do you give? - A small task, Queen.

601
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:42,759
The idol that is causing all the problems . . .

602
01:21:43,287 --> 01:21:45,278
what if that itself goes missing?

603
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:58,760
You are right, but if Rana gets a whiff of it . . .

604
01:21:59,287 --> 01:22:04,280
If I was not good at my job, why would I be famous?

605
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:08,279
Just hear me without any worry.

606
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:20,275
Careful.

607
01:24:25,766 --> 01:24:26,755
Careful Panda.

608
01:24:29,287 --> 01:24:30,275
Let's go.

609
01:24:51,287 --> 01:24:54,757
Mahajan has never failed until today.

610
01:24:55,287 --> 01:24:57,278
Nor he ever will.

611
01:25:15,287 --> 01:25:16,275
Where did he go?

612
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:21,280
Prince! Get up! - What happened?

613
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:24,280
Have you seen my Girdhar Gopal?

614
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:29,280
He was with you. - He was, but . . .

615
01:25:29,766 --> 01:25:33,760
Then where can he go? - Where do I look for my Girdhar?

616
01:25:36,287 --> 01:25:41,759
Lalita, get up! Where did my Girdhar Gopal go? Did you see him?

617
01:25:42,006 --> 01:25:46,761
No. - Where did he leave me and go?

618
01:25:48,287 --> 01:25:52,166
Give. . .quick! Is anyone watching?

619
01:25:52,287 --> 01:25:53,275
No.

620
01:26:12,287 --> 01:26:18,760
Enough ! How will the flute be played now without the flute?

621
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:34,279
Prince Vikram unnecessarily gets worried. I can . . .

622
01:26:39,287 --> 01:26:40,275
What's happening?

623
01:27:12,287 --> 01:27:13,275
Run !

624
01:28:10,287 --> 01:28:16,283
O Girdhar Gopal, don't ever leave me again.

625
01:28:22,287 --> 01:28:31,286
Rest assured. Dayaram and Mahajan will come with the good news.

626
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:36,760
Disaster! Master, disaster!

627
01:28:42,766 --> 01:28:43,755
What happened?

628
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:47,083
We cannot believe even after seeing that such a thing can happen.

629
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:49,005
But what happened?

630
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:52,279
Didn't I tell you Master, that the Prince's wife is a sorcerer?

631
01:28:52,367 --> 01:28:55,164
We realized today that the idol she calls Girdhar . . .

632
01:28:55,287 --> 01:28:58,677
Is not Girdhar's idol. - It is a magic idol.

633
01:29:00,766 --> 01:29:03,280
We buried it deep in the ground.

634
01:29:03,367 --> 01:29:05,278
But it ripped open the ground and came out.

635
01:29:08,287 --> 01:29:11,279
We somehow managed to save our lives and come here.

636
01:29:14,287 --> 01:29:17,279
So has that idol come back? - Ofcourse.

637
01:29:17,367 --> 01:29:18,355
Yes Master.

638
01:29:19,766 --> 01:29:25,284
Suraj, I can't believe this is possible.

639
01:29:25,766 --> 01:29:27,757
Everything is possible with black magic.

640
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:34,757
We will have to deal with this magic with magic.

641
01:29:51,685 --> 01:29:56,679
Congratulations! Your temple is ready.

642
01:29:57,685 --> 01:29:59,164
Really? - Yes.

643
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:01,679
Your temple is ready.

644
01:30:01,765 --> 01:30:03,676
The installation will also be done today.

645
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:06,680
Rana has sent me to bring the idol.

646
01:31:57,685 --> 01:32:02,679
''Forgetting all norms, I tie anklets to my feet''

647
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:08,159
''I surrender everything, my Girdhar is here! ''

648
01:32:08,405 --> 01:32:14,162
''Wearing peacock feathers, I will dance with abandon''

649
01:33:35,685 --> 01:33:41,681
''My craving of years has been satiated''

650
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:49,159
''My world is brimming with happiness today''

651
01:33:49,685 --> 01:33:54,156
''I once again desire to live''

652
01:33:54,685 --> 01:33:57,153
''Girdhar in my body, Girdhar in my soul''

653
01:33:57,685 --> 01:34:00,153
''Girdhar all around me''

654
01:34:11,166 --> 01:34:16,159
''Wearing peacock feathers, I will dance with abandon''

655
01:35:03,685 --> 01:35:08,679
''Mohan's flute has begun to play again''

656
01:35:11,685 --> 01:35:16,156
''It is echoing in my every sinew''

657
01:35:17,166 --> 01:35:21,159
''I have his name on my lips''

658
01:35:38,166 --> 01:35:43,159
''Wearing peacock feathers, I will dance with abandon . . . ''

659
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:09,681
Great mother! The honour of our family . . .

660
01:37:09,765 --> 01:37:12,677
on the pretext of this temple, has begun to dance outside the palace!

661
01:37:13,685 --> 01:37:15,676
My head hangs in shame.

662
01:37:24,685 --> 01:37:25,674
Bless you.

663
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:38,164
You called me, Rana?

664
01:37:41,685 --> 01:37:44,677
Yes Bhojraj. I. . .

665
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:55,680
want to discuss something about Meera.

666
01:37:57,685 --> 01:38:03,157
Yes? - I'm not saying she should not worship

667
01:38:03,685 --> 01:38:05,676
That she should not sing hymns.

668
01:38:06,166 --> 01:38:08,157
I have no objection.

669
01:38:09,685 --> 01:38:17,683
But she should not forget she belongs to the royal family of Mewad.

670
01:38:20,685 --> 01:38:28,683
She is the Queen in waiting. Dancing before the subjects is not done.

671
01:38:33,685 --> 01:38:36,153
It is very shameful for us.

672
01:38:39,685 --> 01:38:42,153
This should not happen again.

673
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:45,674
Yes.

674
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:05,679
Wife, I respect your feelings.

675
01:39:07,685 --> 01:39:13,157
I also accept that you don't belong to me, but to Girdhar Gopal.

676
01:39:16,685 --> 01:39:22,157
That is an understanding between us. It is our private secret.

677
01:39:22,886 --> 01:39:29,155
Private matters of the royal family reaching the eyes &amp; ears of subjects. . .

678
01:39:31,405 --> 01:39:35,159
is against the family norms. It is not proper.

679
01:39:40,685 --> 01:39:43,677
What do you mean?

680
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:45,679
You understood correctly.

681
01:39:47,685 --> 01:39:53,157
Not only me, even Rana didn't like . . .

682
01:39:54,685 --> 01:40:01,158
that the royal queen, wearing anklets in her feet . . .

683
01:40:02,166 --> 01:40:04,157
sing and dance before the subjects.

684
01:40:04,685 --> 01:40:11,158
Prince, high and low class and creed are all man made divisions.

685
01:40:12,485 --> 01:40:16,161
In Girdhar's temple, there is no discrimination.

686
01:40:16,685 --> 01:40:21,156
Whoever goes there, is just a beggar begging for Girdhar's mercy.

687
01:40:21,685 --> 01:40:26,679
All are equal. All of them have a right to worship him.

688
01:40:32,685 --> 01:40:36,076
That means you won't listen to me?

689
01:40:36,166 --> 01:40:39,681
Why not? But it should be something that can be followed.

690
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:46,685
Tell me, just to follow your orders, should I annoy my Girdhar?

691
01:40:52,685 --> 01:40:53,674
Hail Girdhar Gopal !

692
01:40:54,685 --> 01:40:57,404
I'm not saying she should not worship.

693
01:40:57,685 --> 01:40:59,676
That she should not sing hymns.

694
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:08,163
But she should not forget she belongs to the royal family of Mewad.

695
01:41:09,685 --> 01:41:16,158
She is the Queen in waiting. Dancing before the subjects is not done.

696
01:41:17,166 --> 01:41:20,158
It is very shameful for us.

697
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:25,157
This should not happen again.

698
01:41:42,166 --> 01:41:44,157
Even Rana didn't like . . .

699
01:41:44,685 --> 01:41:50,555
that the royal queen, wearing anklets in her feet . . .

700
01:41:50,685 --> 01:41:52,676
sing and dance before the subjects.

701
01:41:52,765 --> 01:41:57,555
Prince, high and low class and creed are all man made divisions.

702
01:41:57,685 --> 01:42:00,677
All of them have a right to worship Girdhar.

703
01:42:00,765 --> 01:42:04,155
That means you won't listen to me?

704
01:42:04,685 --> 01:42:08,564
Why not? But it should be something that can be followed.

705
01:42:08,685 --> 01:42:15,158
Tell me, just to follow your orders, should I annoy my Girdhar?

706
01:42:19,685 --> 01:42:22,153
What dilemma have I got myself into?

707
01:42:25,086 --> 01:42:28,158
Who do I listen to, and who not?

708
01:42:35,685 --> 01:42:39,155
Master! - Do you always have to disturb me?

709
01:42:39,685 --> 01:42:42,677
Master, you always start scolding the moment you see me.

710
01:42:42,765 --> 01:42:45,677
I'd brought good news. - What good news?

711
01:42:46,086 --> 01:42:49,158
Bhojraj has developed fever.

712
01:42:50,685 --> 01:42:53,677
Fever? Is that good news?

713
01:42:53,765 --> 01:42:56,677
It can be turned into good news.

714
01:42:57,685 --> 01:43:00,677
Right, Mahajan? - Absolutely.

715
01:43:00,765 --> 01:43:01,754
How is that?

716
01:43:12,485 --> 01:43:13,474
But. . .

717
01:43:13,565 --> 01:43:16,682
One must be prepared to do anything to get power.

718
01:43:17,685 --> 01:43:19,164
That's politics.

719
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:47,162
Take rest now, wife. - I am not tired to go and rest.

720
01:43:48,685 --> 01:43:51,153
Are you feeling better?

721
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:55,153
Your hand is no ordinary hand.

722
01:43:57,685 --> 01:44:01,679
Your Girdhar Gopal's blessing is hidden in it.

723
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:08,159
How can pain stay then?

724
01:44:12,166 --> 01:44:14,680
Tell me something. - Yes?

725
01:44:17,926 --> 01:44:22,556
Do you have any complaints, any sorrow, any . . .

726
01:44:22,685 --> 01:44:27,554
Prince, the sacrifice you have made for me . . .

727
01:44:27,685 --> 01:44:30,677
only a great soul can make that sacrifice.

728
01:44:32,685 --> 01:44:35,563
You gave up the right of of a husband . . .

729
01:44:35,685 --> 01:44:38,677
and made Meera Girdhar's eternal wife.

730
01:44:38,765 --> 01:44:43,156
Even several lives will be less to repay this debt.

731
01:44:43,685 --> 01:44:52,161
Don't embarrass me. Go make the bed for your Girdhar.

732
01:44:53,685 --> 01:44:58,156
Or he won't sleep. - First you sleep, the I will leave.

733
01:44:58,405 --> 01:45:00,158
I will sleep.

734
01:45:01,685 --> 01:45:06,156
The fever has subsided now. You leave.

735
01:45:07,685 --> 01:45:09,676
But . . . - Don't worry.

736
01:45:10,685 --> 01:45:17,158
The physician is going to come now. Go and take rest.

737
01:45:39,685 --> 01:45:41,164
What do you want?

738
01:45:46,405 --> 01:45:49,078
Give me the medicine you have brought.

739
01:45:49,166 --> 01:45:53,681
Prince Vikram, you? - Yes. Give this medicine instead.

740
01:45:53,765 --> 01:45:55,562
What is this? - Poison.

741
01:45:55,685 --> 01:45:58,404
No, I cannot do that. I am the royal physician.

742
01:45:58,485 --> 01:46:01,557
I cannot be disloyal. I cannot commit this sin.

743
01:46:03,685 --> 01:46:06,153
Then even your son won't see tomorrow's dawn.

744
01:46:06,685 --> 01:46:10,155
Think again. On one hand is this small job . . .

745
01:46:10,685 --> 01:46:12,676
and on the other is your son's life.

746
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:15,680
Take, physician.

747
01:46:18,685 --> 01:46:20,164
Oh God, forgive me.

748
01:46:24,685 --> 01:46:28,155
Madam, come quickly! The Prince's health is deteriorating.

749
01:46:33,685 --> 01:46:35,164
Rana has called you.

750
01:46:43,685 --> 01:46:48,679
Prince. . . Prince.

751
01:46:52,685 --> 01:46:57,156
Prince. . .open your eyes.

752
01:46:58,685 --> 01:47:02,155
Look, your wife has come.

753
01:47:15,685 --> 01:47:18,677
Wife. - Yes?

754
01:47:20,086 --> 01:47:25,682
I am leaving. Your Girdhar Gopal willed that.

755
01:47:29,166 --> 01:47:31,680
I am leaving you under his care.

756
01:47:37,166 --> 01:47:38,679
Hail Girdhar Gopal !

757
01:47:44,685 --> 01:47:49,679
My son ! - Why did you leave us?

758
01:48:00,685 --> 01:48:02,164
Whatever Girdhar wills.

759
01:48:23,166 --> 01:48:30,083
Uncle, I fear the physician may reveal everything.

760
01:48:30,166 --> 01:48:35,159
That has been taken care of. Both father and son were poisoned. . .

761
01:48:35,286 --> 01:48:37,163
and pushed in the lake last night.

762
01:48:37,685 --> 01:48:40,153
The whole story is over now.

763
01:48:43,685 --> 01:48:50,557
One hurdle has been removed. Uncle, we have to remove the other hurdle too now

764
01:48:50,685 --> 01:48:55,156
Don't worry about Meera, how can she harm you?

765
01:48:56,685 --> 01:49:02,157
If she tries something, we'll handle it.

766
01:49:10,685 --> 01:49:11,674
Sister-in-law. . .

767
01:49:13,685 --> 01:49:17,394
God ! I have never come across such a woman.

768
01:49:17,685 --> 01:49:20,153
Your husband's body is lying over there . . .

769
01:49:20,286 --> 01:49:23,163
and you are standing at the window all dressed up?

770
01:49:32,685 --> 01:49:35,404
You tormented him enough when he was alive.

771
01:49:36,685 --> 01:49:39,153
Atleast let his soul rest in peace now.

772
01:49:41,685 --> 01:49:44,677
If the world sees you like this, what will they say?

773
01:49:46,685 --> 01:49:50,076
Hurry up, his body is about to be cremated.

774
01:49:50,685 --> 01:49:54,679
Uda, break her bangles. Wipe her vermilion dot.

775
01:49:56,166 --> 01:49:59,681
She won't listen like that. Move ahead and break her bangles!

776
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:05,681
No one can eliminate Meera's husband.

777
01:50:06,086 --> 01:50:09,681
Shut-up! Your stubbornness won't be tolerated now, understand !

778
01:50:11,685 --> 01:50:16,076
Meera is the wife of Girdhar Gopal. Girdhar's eternal wife.

779
01:50:16,685 --> 01:50:20,155
No one can eliminate her husband, not even Girdhar himself.

780
01:50:20,685 --> 01:50:26,681
Uda, tell Rana and make arrangements for her to be cremated with the Prince.

781
01:50:27,685 --> 01:50:29,563
Let her story end here.

782
01:50:29,685 --> 01:50:34,679
Everyone has to get cremated, mother. Even I will.

783
01:50:34,765 --> 01:50:37,677
But the Prince will have to go alone today.

784
01:50:37,765 --> 01:50:40,677
Why? You claim yourself to be a great devotee.

785
01:50:40,765 --> 01:50:46,158
Don't you know that a husband and wife bond is eternal?

786
01:50:46,685 --> 01:50:49,153
The wife follows her husband.

787
01:50:49,685 --> 01:50:52,677
When the husband dies, the wife has to die too.

788
01:50:53,685 --> 01:50:56,404
That's our tradition. - That is what even I'm saying.

789
01:50:56,685 --> 01:51:04,161
The wife follows her husband. Where there is Girdhar, Meera will follow

790
01:51:05,685 --> 01:51:10,679
I will tell Rana about your deeds!

791
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:36,679
Your darling Meera has brought the royal family shame.

792
01:51:38,685 --> 01:51:43,156
Whoever sees her dressed as a bride, laughs at us . . .

793
01:51:43,685 --> 01:51:45,676
slings mud at the royal family.

794
01:51:46,685 --> 01:51:49,677
There is no point in telling him anything.

795
01:51:51,166 --> 01:51:53,680
Even he can see it all.

796
01:51:55,685 --> 01:52:00,076
Rana, I ask you the last time. . .

797
01:52:01,166 --> 01:52:07,162
is allowing a widow to live as a married woman according to tradition?

798
01:52:09,685 --> 01:52:11,676
Is all this acceptable to you?

799
01:52:11,765 --> 01:52:15,678
Pardon me for interrupting, Rana.

800
01:52:22,685 --> 01:52:25,153
I myself don't want to live in the palace now.

801
01:52:26,685 --> 01:52:28,164
I feel suffocated here.

802
01:52:28,685 --> 01:52:30,563
Then where does my daughter want to live?

803
01:52:30,685 --> 01:52:32,676
Under my Girdhar's shadow

804
01:52:33,685 --> 01:52:38,156
And his shadow exists in every place of pilgrimage, every temple . . .

805
01:52:38,286 --> 01:52:40,675
the heart of every devotee.

806
01:52:44,166 --> 01:52:48,159
Is that your final decision?

807
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:53,156
It is not my decision, it is the will of Girdhar Gopal.

808
01:52:55,685 --> 01:53:01,078
Okay then child, Girdhar's will is undeniable.

809
01:53:03,685 --> 01:53:06,074
Arrangements will be made for your pilgrimage.

810
01:53:43,485 --> 01:53:45,680
''You are Krishna''

811
01:53:48,685 --> 01:53:50,676
''You are Kanhaiya''

812
01:53:53,685 --> 01:54:00,682
''I have given you my life's boat to steer''

813
01:54:25,166 --> 01:54:33,676
''Whether you drown me mid-sea or take me to shore''

814
01:54:35,685 --> 01:54:38,677
''You are Krishna . . . ''

815
01:55:15,685 --> 01:55:19,679
''Since I have opened my eyes''

816
01:55:20,685 --> 01:55:25,156
''I have never been happy''

817
01:55:35,685 --> 01:55:40,156
''The journey is long, the sun high''

818
01:55:40,685 --> 01:55:45,679
''All my hopes are pinned on you''

819
01:55:46,166 --> 01:55:50,681
''If you wish, even among thorns . . . ''

820
01:55:56,685 --> 01:55:59,677
''you can make flowers bloom''

821
01:56:01,685 --> 01:56:04,153
''You are Krishna . . . ''

822
01:56:41,685 --> 01:56:46,156
''I have no other place to go''

823
01:56:46,685 --> 01:56:51,156
''You know everything, I don't have to tell you''

824
01:57:02,166 --> 01:57:06,681
''The night is long, the moments full of sorrow''

825
01:57:07,166 --> 01:57:11,681
''What disaster has befallen me?''

826
01:57:12,685 --> 01:57:16,679
''Where do I go leaving you?''

827
01:57:22,685 --> 01:57:26,155
''Tell me that''

828
01:57:28,166 --> 01:57:31,158
''You are Krishna. . . ''

829
01:58:57,685 --> 01:59:03,157
Where are you going? Go back.

830
01:59:03,685 --> 01:59:06,153
I plead with you, go back.

831
01:59:09,685 --> 01:59:13,155
Is this Goswami's ashram? - That's why I'm asking you to go back.

832
01:59:13,685 --> 01:59:16,677
You cannot meet him. - Why?

833
01:59:17,086 --> 01:59:22,399
Is he meditating? - No, but women are not allowed here.

834
01:59:23,166 --> 01:59:26,158
Reason? - Guruji is a celibate man.

835
01:59:26,685 --> 01:59:29,404
He stays away even from the shadow of women.

836
01:59:29,685 --> 01:59:33,679
Is it? Does he consider himself man?

837
01:59:33,765 --> 01:59:37,678
Why? Isn't a celibate, a man?

838
01:59:37,765 --> 01:59:41,678
I think there is only one man in the world.

839
01:59:42,166 --> 01:59:43,679
One greatest man.

840
01:59:44,685 --> 01:59:49,679
Apart from him, Meera doesn't know, nor accept anyone else as a man.

841
01:59:50,685 --> 01:59:58,081
So brother, go and tell Goswami, that Meera doesn't meet any man. . .

842
01:59:58,166 --> 01:59:59,154
other than Girdhar.

843
02:00:00,166 --> 02:00:06,162
' I belong only to Girdhar Gopal, none else'

844
02:00:06,685 --> 02:00:11,679
' One who wears a peacock feather crown, is my husband'

845
02:00:35,685 --> 02:00:38,677
Pardon me mother, this fool made a grave mistake.

846
02:00:38,765 --> 02:00:43,156
The knowledge you imparted, only a great soul can impart it.

847
02:00:43,685 --> 02:00:49,396
Get up. Goswami. To err is human.

848
02:00:49,685 --> 02:00:53,394
I will leave your feet only after you have forgiven me.

849
02:00:53,685 --> 02:00:57,394
Girdhar Gopal is the one who forgives.

850
02:00:58,685 --> 02:01:02,679
Now don't be stubborn. I have moved ahead on my path.

851
02:01:03,685 --> 02:01:05,676
I will not turn back now.

852
02:01:36,166 --> 02:01:38,157
Greetings. - Bless you.

853
02:01:38,685 --> 02:01:40,676
What news have you brought from Chittor?

854
02:01:41,405 --> 02:01:45,399
I have bad news. Since you left Chittor . . .

855
02:01:45,685 --> 02:01:47,676
it has become an ill-fated land.

856
02:01:48,166 --> 02:01:53,684
Rana Sangram Singh and your father, Rao Ratan Singh, died in a battle.

857
02:01:54,685 --> 02:01:56,164
Whatever Girdhar wills.

858
02:01:56,685 --> 02:01:59,153
Chittor was attacked again.

859
02:01:59,685 --> 02:02:04,679
All the brave men jumped into the battleground.

860
02:02:04,765 --> 02:02:06,676
And they all were martyred.

861
02:02:07,685 --> 02:02:09,676
How is Queen Karmavati?

862
02:02:10,685 --> 02:02:12,676
Along with all the other Rajputani women of Chittor . . .

863
02:02:12,765 --> 02:02:16,678
even she sacrificed her life in the pyre of her husband.

864
02:02:17,685 --> 02:02:19,164
Even that is Girdhar's will.

865
02:02:19,685 --> 02:02:23,679
But the people of Chittor wish that you return to Chittor.

866
02:02:24,685 --> 02:02:28,679
Due to your good deeds, good luck will return to Chittor.

867
02:02:29,166 --> 02:02:35,162
Girdhar's empty temple, on getting back its idol,will bring back happiness

868
02:02:35,685 --> 02:02:37,563
Please don't refuse, Queen.

869
02:02:37,685 --> 02:02:41,155
Don't refuse, this is the tormented call of the people of Chittor.

870
02:02:41,405 --> 02:02:44,158
Please save Chittor.

871
02:02:47,685 --> 02:02:48,674
I take your leave.

872
02:03:04,166 --> 02:03:09,159
''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me''

873
02:03:24,685 --> 02:03:28,679
''How do I live without him?''

874
02:03:29,685 --> 02:03:33,679
''I have to live and die with him''

875
02:03:34,685 --> 02:03:39,156
''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me . . . ''

876
02:04:06,685 --> 02:04:11,076
Years ago, when this sorcerer left Chittor . . .

877
02:04:11,166 --> 02:04:14,556
I thought God has saved our family honour.

878
02:04:18,765 --> 02:04:20,164
is related to me.

879
02:04:20,685 --> 02:04:27,682
But, by starting all the drama again, she has reminded me everything.

880
02:04:27,765 --> 02:04:31,678
My sleep, hunger, thirst, this woman has snatched everything.

881
02:04:32,166 --> 02:04:37,159
And Master, this time, she has returned with the support of the people

882
02:04:37,685 --> 02:04:40,677
If you try and make her leave by force . . .

883
02:04:40,765 --> 02:04:43,404
the people can rebel.

884
02:04:45,685 --> 02:04:50,679
When you have me, why do you worry so much, Rana?

885
02:04:51,685 --> 02:04:54,153
I am seeing you worried since many days.

886
02:04:55,685 --> 02:04:58,677
I thought I'll bring along a solution to it today.

887
02:05:01,685 --> 02:05:09,081
This is poison. A poison so strong, even one drop can prove fatal.

888
02:05:09,166 --> 02:05:13,159
What are you saying ! - Don't think about what after this.

889
02:05:14,685 --> 02:05:22,161
I will have her body disposed in such a manner, that no one will know.

890
02:05:24,685 --> 02:05:29,156
That's okay, but this task is not as simple as you think.

891
02:05:29,685 --> 02:05:33,679
Why do you think like that when you have Dayaram Panda?

892
02:05:34,685 --> 02:05:37,677
Dayaram, will you be able to do this job?

893
02:06:00,685 --> 02:06:03,153
Rana has sent this sacred water for you.

894
02:06:04,166 --> 02:06:09,159
He said it is from Chatur Bhuj sent by your aunt from Maidta.

895
02:06:12,166 --> 02:06:15,681
Sacred water from Chatur Bhuj? - Yes.

896
02:06:21,685 --> 02:06:25,155
May I leave? - Yes.

897
02:06:33,685 --> 02:06:37,155
No, don't drink that. - Why?

898
02:06:37,286 --> 02:06:39,277
He was Rana's well wisher.

899
02:06:41,685 --> 02:06:48,682
I know. But whatever has been given to me as sacred water . . .

900
02:06:49,685 --> 02:06:51,676
I cannot disrespect it.

901
02:06:53,685 --> 02:06:58,679
I will consider it the sacred water of Girdhar and drink it.

902
02:07:18,685 --> 02:07:22,679
Madam look, Girdhar's idol has turned blue.

903
02:07:41,685 --> 02:07:43,563
What nonsense are you talking !

904
02:07:43,685 --> 02:07:47,679
That impostor drank the poison and Girdhar turned blue?

905
02:07:48,166 --> 02:07:50,157
That she is not a woman, she is Goddess?

906
02:07:50,286 --> 02:07:52,163
I witnessed it myself, Master.

907
02:07:53,685 --> 02:07:57,679
I understand this pretense, these miracles, very well.

908
02:07:58,685 --> 02:08:01,677
No one can save that brazen woman from me.

909
02:08:02,685 --> 02:08:06,155
That Girdhar is a small idol, like a toy.

910
02:08:06,685 --> 02:08:08,563
Don't make that mistake, son.

911
02:08:08,685 --> 02:08:13,679
We were naive to assume her divine powers to be magical powers.

912
02:08:14,685 --> 02:08:15,674
But . . .

913
02:10:10,685 --> 02:10:18,161
' I belong only to Girdhar Gopal, none else'

914
02:10:20,685 --> 02:10:24,155
Lalita, I want to leave this place.

915
02:10:25,685 --> 02:10:29,679
Not for the fear of Rana, but due to the sorrow . . .

916
02:10:29,765 --> 02:10:35,158
that because of me, my Girdhar had to suffer a lot.

917
02:10:36,685 --> 02:10:39,677
Not any more, Girdhar.

918
02:10:40,685 --> 02:10:43,677
What are you saying Queen? Will you also leave me. . .

919
02:10:43,765 --> 02:10:50,159
Don't call me Queen. Call me Meera, your friend.

920
02:10:51,685 --> 02:10:54,677
Our journey together was only until here.

921
02:10:55,685 --> 02:10:59,679
Accept it as Girdhar's will and honour it.

922
02:12:11,685 --> 02:12:17,157
''Renouncing the world goes Meera''

923
02:12:25,685 --> 02:12:30,679
''She is lost in the love of her beloved''

924
02:12:31,166 --> 02:12:36,159
''See her passion, O people''

925
02:12:36,685 --> 02:12:41,679
''Meera is immersed in the love of Girdhar''

926
02:13:41,685 --> 02:13:46,679
''She shares an eternal bond with Mohan''

927
02:13:47,166 --> 02:13:52,684
''How can it break? She is the body, he the soul''

928
02:14:09,685 --> 02:14:15,157
''She consumed a cup full of poison''

929
02:14:15,685 --> 02:14:20,679
''And found life even in it''

930
02:14:21,166 --> 02:14:26,684
''Renouncing the world goes Meera''

931
02:15:51,166 --> 02:15:56,159
''She doesn't know anything, she is crazy about Shyam''

932
02:15:56,685 --> 02:16:02,157
''Her story is unique''

933
02:16:19,685 --> 02:16:25,157
''She spent a tormented childhood''

934
02:16:25,685 --> 02:16:30,679
''Her youth has been full of pain''

935
02:16:31,166 --> 02:16:36,683
''Renouncing the world goes Meera . . . ''
