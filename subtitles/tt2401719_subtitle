1
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,522
"Time crawls while I fly."

2
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,287
"It ponders every
moment before taking a step."

3
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:47,083
"Time is simple, I am sly."

4
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,640
"That's the fact."

5
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,244
"Time is omnipotent."

6
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,608
"Time crawls while I fly."

7
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,250
"It ponders every
moment before taking a step."

8
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,050
Where are you staying these days?

9
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,130
And with whom?

10
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,811
Did you find a place?

11
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,809
I Don't have a home, just keys..

12
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,167
Keep one more. Come over whenever.

13
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,405
I don't know Arfie, I don't know man..

14
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,489
I seriously don't know man!

15
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,081
Remember when Gulshan came
to our place for the first time?

16
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,446
And he got this" lots
of vodka for us to drink.

17
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,723
And we drank like crazy.. just like...

18
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,604
Drank like crazy.

19
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,610
And I was getting irritated;
what is this guy who the fu** is he..

20
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,564
...who is he and where is he from..

21
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,122
"Eating, drinking, singing at my home!

22
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,681
And I could see
that you are about to puke.

23
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,843
And then above all you had to
fu***** puke in the middle of my room.

24
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,326
Dude you know I don't
drink that much.. he forced me.

25
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,961
I was so irritated, I had
no option. I left the room..

26
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,488
...and when I come back,
what do I see, I see Gulshan..

27
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,964
...Is cleaning the floor.

28
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,765
And I told him what are you doing dude?

29
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,604
I'll clean it.. its fine.

30
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,967
He tells me.. the stench
will be out in 5 minutes you know..

31
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,685
...will be out in 5 minutes.

32
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,891
And I was like..

33
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,171
Fun'

34
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,729
He was so comfortable.

35
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,491
Ok you tell me if,
you go to someone's home.

36
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,088
And he tells you to take a
bottle of water from the fridge.

37
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,367
What will you do?

38
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,166
I will be so embarrassed you know..

39
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,089
I will be so embarrassed to do that.

40
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,085
"But this guy was cleaning your vomit.

41
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,885
Because he needs
spotlight all the time, Chandan.

42
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,487
I think, I really liked the guy..

43
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,367
I think I liked him..

44
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,563
It's not about that
how he tried to help me..

45
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,887
"But it was about.
.the way he did it you know.

46
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,601
It was just"

47
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,091
It's ridiculous
Chandan, absolutely ridiculous.

48
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,724
Hey, Shubhangi, you were
absent in the class today"

49
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,762
What? I can't hear you..

50
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,090
You were absent in the
class today, why? -Just..

51
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,610
I have a huge crush on you.

52
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,368
No.. really.. since when?

53
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,441
Just one minute" you won't mind right?

54
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,282
So.. what was I saying?

55
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,249
Yea.. -You have a crush on me..

56
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,722
For the last four years I
have had a huge crush on you.. what?

57
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,890
I am not dunk, I just had
five pints of beer you know..

58
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,961
I know that's.

59
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,447
I can pee that much
right now.. five pints of beer..

60
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,330
Not here.. -But
that's not the point.. -Then?

61
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,727
For last, last four years I
have been dying to tell you that.

62
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,882
...you know, like, I
have a huge crush on you.

63
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,085
And here I go, And feel so
glad that I just said it you know!

64
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,846
Yeah, you are dancing.

65
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,326
How hard was that? Was that hard?

66
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,091
This is what my friend
Chandan should have said.

67
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,322
How hard is this" see..

68
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,289
Chandan.. was that hard?

69
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,765
See you man.. see you guys..

70
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,290
He loves you.

71
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,890
I love you too.

72
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,680
Chandan..

73
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,890
You don't have to like me..

74
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,963
You don't have to say
this to Shubhangi or me ok!

75
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,890
See, there are some reasons.

76
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,929
Reason no. 1..

77
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,322
If you want something.

78
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,442
"Then you should get it your way.

79
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,567
If you don't get it your
way, it's not yours.. okay? Right?

80
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,928
Look here man.

81
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,244
Don't look here and there.

82
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,445
Reason no. 2..

83
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,289
I am not stupid. -You
shouldn't have said it in front.

84
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,368
...of Shubhangi's boy
friend.. -I did not like it.

85
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,244
Nice.. nice man.

86
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,410
Where are you staying these days?

87
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,723
And with whom?

88
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,081
Did you find a place?

89
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,965
I Don't have a home yet, just keys..

90
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,846
Keep one more. Come over whenever.

91
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,601
Don't know if he was
even listening to me man.

92
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,162
Exactly Chandan, he
wasn't listening to you.

93
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,363
Especially after last
night. -And the way he just went in..

94
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,725
...disappeared into the ocean.

95
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,848
It was so wonderful to see someone..

96
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,327
...so free you know.. so free..

97
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,130
It was so wonderful.

98
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,401
The way he..

99
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,330
...rolls his joint.

100
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,131
Puts it under his lips..

101
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,087
Takes a deep drag..

102
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,963
...and throws big fat
chain of smoke right into the air.

103
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,611
And have you noticed An'ie..

104
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,128
...while pissing,
his head goes backward..

105
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,568
...as if he is fu*****
'orgasming' or something.

106
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,966
You even observed that?

107
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,687
That's disgusting Chandan.

108
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,803
While his bike is still moving..

109
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,087
...he puts it on a stand and parks it.

110
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,091
Can you beat that?

111
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,885
But there is one thing"

112
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,085
One thing"

113
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,930
...he can't beat me at.

114
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,601
Shubangi. And you know how she is?

115
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,730
I know how Shubhangi is..

116
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,450
Handle with care types.

117
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,648
Because I don't
know what to do about it.

118
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,245
You are not concerned about it?

119
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,361
No.

120
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,930
You don't care, if I care or not.

121
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,566
What do you care? -Why
were you not taking my call?

122
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,648
Because I don't
feel like taking your call.

123
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,688
You don't feel like taking my calls!

124
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,330
Yes. -Why?

125
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,606
Because.. -WHY?

126
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,409
Because you annoy me!

127
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,089
Ohh.. Hello..

128
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,925
Hi. Congratulations
for the Prague project.

129
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,606
Thank you, Where are you going?

130
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,325
Where would I go?

131
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,171
I will be in Mumbai itself.
- Shubhangi, 2 minutes please..

132
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,845
So what have you
thought about the Prague project?

133
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,084
Prague project. nothing much..

134
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,409
...there were so many invasions, deaths.

135
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,763
I thought, I will make a peace monument.

136
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,961
Yeah how wonderful..

137
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,810
...you know all the world
wars and concentration camps..

138
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,486
...and so many spooky
stories. -Shubhangi 2 minutes please.

139
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,126
And you know there is a
clock in Prague which never stops"

140
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,322
...because they say a ghost runs it.

141
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,567
Have you heard of
that? -The Astronomical clock.

142
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,647
Yeah, exactly that.

143
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,842
Shubhangi C'mon..
just listen to me for 2 mins.

144
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,689
I think I will catch you later.

145
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,922
No no, wait Chandan. Leave my hand.

146
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,885
Leave my hand..

147
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,481
...I told you I
didn't want to talk to you.

148
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,443
You did the same with An'ie right?

149
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,325
You were saying something?

150
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,521
What?

151
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,970
You were asking for a
treat. And I said no. -Ohh..

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,924
But you insisted, so I said,
ok I will treat you with coffee..

153
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,481
Lets go then"

154
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,721
You remember that?

155
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,848
Yeah I think I remember it a little now.

156
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,610
So shall we?

157
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,681
Let's go..

158
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,881
Yeah? -Yeah.

159
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,481
Okay.

160
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,329
So I thought, I
will treat you with coffee.

161
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,522
Nice.. Nice man!

162
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,882
I think the contours are all wrong?

163
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,601
And you need to
space out the cottages more.

164
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,247
The axis is not well-defined.

165
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,683
If you take this to him,
then Chishti will tear it apart.

166
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,801
But submission is
tomorrow, then? How will I do it?

167
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,881
You will?

168
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,724
Offcourse -Thank you.

169
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,445
Yeah -Okay yea..

170
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,371
Hey guys!

171
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,801
What's up?

172
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,246
Hey.. you tell me..

173
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,845
Why is he looking at us like that?

174
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,961
Is she white? -Huh?

175
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,367
I mean are you white? -No.

176
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,767
2 years in US, and
she is all American now?

177
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,129
She calls dating dating"

178
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,889
"but khaungi 'khaugi' and
jaungi "Jaugi". What the fu**?

179
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,650
What's your point exactly?

180
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,202
You just say one word
correctly which has "Ung" sound..

181
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,566
Hey leave it man..

182
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,089
Ok leave that, Chandan,
listen, this is your responsibility"

183
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,807
"just get the basic
words right. like.. -Yea..

184
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,366
Like 'Jaungi', 'aaungi..

185
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,321
...'Loongi',
'doongi'.. etc. Etc.. -Com'on man.

186
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,771
She is already looking so sad..

187
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,649
...she will get even sadder. -I know..

188
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,127
This looks sad?

189
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,970
Her being sad is being sad..

190
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,241
An d Vij ay?

191
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,442
His pain is nothing
just because he is a guy?

192
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,682
How sexist is that Chandan fu****?

193
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,927
Fine which word?

194
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,089
"Janghein".. Thighs.

195
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,847
Take your time.

196
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,605
I will come tomorrow"

197
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,201
I'll see you tomorrow.

198
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,571
Shubhangi?

199
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,563
That's a great comeback I must say that.

200
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,688
I was about to give
her "Nangi" you know..

201
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,364
...and she would have given up..

202
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,406
"Just to be subtle I
didn't. -Ok, now please shut up..

203
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,681
This what she would have said, shut up..

204
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,404
And would have shut herself up.

205
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,885
She's so predictable man..

206
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,120
So are you..
- Anyways, I don't have time"

207
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,491
It was nice. -I know.

208
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,969
Keep practicing!

209
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,930
How do you tolerate such shit?

210
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,366
It's ok, he was joking.

211
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,725
You know that right?

212
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,688
He is just an asshole, it's Ok.

213
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,530
He is such an asshole.

214
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,647
Right.

215
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,405
And anyways he is
going to Prague with you right?

216
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,091
Why would he do that?

217
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,562
You tell me? Why would he do that?

218
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,364
Why in the first place he would do that?

219
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,882
For a moment, I
thought, why is he doing that? Why?

220
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,725
What is he after? Is he
trying to prove a point or something?

221
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,921
Why?

222
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,883
Is he trying to tell me,
this is not how it is done?

223
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,446
Taking her for coffee or..

224
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,608
...helping her with her
project is not going to help you.

225
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,086
Tell me man, what was he trying to do?

226
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,090
We can't smoke here.

227
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,765
He just showed the finger
and left. He just doesn't care.

228
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,888
Exactly Chandan, he just does not care.

229
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,242
Why do you think he is
so cold? He doesn't need you.

230
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,085
Look at us! I need you,
you need me, we are friends man.

231
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,129
That bastard doesn't need anyone.

232
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,847
Shubangi. And you know how she is?

233
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,884
I know how Shubhangi is!

234
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,650
Handle with care types.

235
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,931
And that day we went for lunch.

236
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,445
It was beautiful. Beautiful..

237
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,643
We sat together. had a good meal.

238
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,644
Spoke our heart out.

239
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,246
She was happy..

240
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,091
...she was very happy.

241
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,484
And she was listening to me.

242
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,121
If I am not taking
any of your calls then"

243
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,525
...it can only mean
one of the two things"

244
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,645
"either I am busy..
or I am busy.. you know..

245
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,847
I am not doing it
for attention or power.

246
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,484
I don't need power.

247
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,085
I don't want power.

248
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,891
I mean.. What the fu**.

249
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,490
Are you listening ? -Yeah..

250
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,561
Yeah..

251
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,841
I mean..

252
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,526
...once you pour your
heart out, you are defenseless.

253
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,601
Hmm..

254
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,681
And..

255
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,170
...she played power
games with me, I didn't.

256
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,850
Finally it ended.

257
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,885
How long did you date her?

258
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,966
I think we were together for a year..

259
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,481
For a year..

260
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,487
As in you were dating right?

261
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,289
We were close, we
were very close friends..

262
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,407
Excuse me, Sir..

263
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,131
I will pay the
bill! -No it's 0k, it's ok.

264
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,603
Are you sure? -Let
me take care of it.. yea.

265
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,643
So let me get this straight.

266
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,561
...she wasn't your girlfriend?

267
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,602
She was.. not officially my girlfriend.

268
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,082
But we were just fine.

269
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,645
Yeah of course.

270
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,281
It's my phone..

271
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,600
Lovely.

272
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,089
Sorry -No it's ok.

273
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,321
Hello..

274
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,881
Yeah..

275
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,087
Gulshan is throwing a
party at some one's place..

276
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,889
...for the Prague project.

277
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,962
...and there will be dope
and shit.. will you be interested?

278
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,451
Yeah?

279
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,563
Yea? -Yeah lets go..

280
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,651
Yeah, she will come.

281
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,967
Thanks man..

282
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,361
Thanks..

283
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,884
..."L have lived through,"

284
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,762
"The torrents of rains..“

285
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,529
"I have endured,"

286
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,967
"The brutality of wishes..“

287
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,486
"Here and there,
all across the universe,"

288
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,808
"In the eye of love,
and in the totality of loss,"

289
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,450
"It flies,
uninhibited, the bird of my heart.“

290
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,723
"On the silken moon, and
the shards of broken glass,"

291
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,088
"In the last bouts,
of short, heavy breaths,"

292
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,690
"It flies everywhere,
Desperate, the bird of my heart..“

293
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,730
"Wish it was, empty as heart,"

294
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:13,405
"Fake as tears,"

295
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,085
"Familiar as Earth,"

296
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,480
"Dreamy like mornings,"

297
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,526
"if the day..“ -And I could
see her in the mirror you know.

298
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,801
The funny thing we were
looking at each other in the mirror..

299
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,080
And on the mirror, it was written"

300
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,885
..."The objects are
closer than they appear"

301
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,408
Now you are thinking bullshit Chandan.

302
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,042
Sometimes, just to listen to me..

303
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,600
...she would put her chin on my shoulder.

304
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,802
And I would
deliberately go quiet sometimes.

305
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,282
...to see if she takes
her chin off my shoulder.

306
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,129
But she won't.

307
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,882
I am talking about last night Chandan.

308
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,441
Hi!

309
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,846
"Forget heart.“

310
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:01,402
You can even take my life."

311
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,040
"Just heed my request once."

312
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:23,365
"I accept friends
don't accept our friendship."

313
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,889
Friendship is meaningless..

314
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,407
Friendship's value.. value..

315
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,846
Meaningless..

316
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,881
Anyway.

317
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:40,691
But that shouldn't make
you take favors from strangers.

318
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,688
Nice.. wow..

319
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,882
Don't just say wow.

320
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,562
Do you know what it means?

321
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,844
This line is so sexy. What do you say?

322
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,763
A girl is saying..

323
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,646
I won't look at you..

324
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,326
...I won't talk to you,
I won't come close to you.

325
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,851
She is cold.

326
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,965
She doesn't care about
love, romance and all that crap.

327
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,965
You know, she is like-fu** off..

328
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,524
But, if she sees you lonely and..

329
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,444
...suffering on a terrible night.

330
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,805
Then you won't need to be anywhere else.

331
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,962
She will be the one to take care.

332
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,923
Am I making any sense?

333
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,970
Point is..

334
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,566
...she is cold only till
the point, you don't fall weak.

335
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,689
This line is so sexy.

336
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,281
"Forget heart.“

337
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:51,282
You can even take my life."

338
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,409
"Just heed my request once."

339
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,687
Watch it.. watch it till the end.

340
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,405
Please don't go.

341
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,804
Does it hurt?

342
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,171
Do you know how much I
like it to watch you suffer.

343
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,289
That's why I am asking you to watch it.

344
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,891
Please, don't go.

345
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,730
Why are you listening to her?

346
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,521
Just get lost.

347
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,365
Why are you torturing yourself?

348
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,291
Chandan go!

349
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,483
Chandan go! -Please don't go..

350
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,120
Just go.

351
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,562
Why are you torturing yourself?

352
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,724
I will go.. I will go..

353
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,969
Shreya babe.. why
did you sing that song?

354
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,570
This line is so sexy!!

355
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,366
I will cook you and eat you up..

356
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,681
I need to pee. Where is the loo?

357
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,768
Babe, go straight and take right.

358
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,326
Chandan.. Chandan.. Chandan..

359
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,290
Bastard, you let her pay the bill?

360
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,846
No, I paid the bill..

361
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,646
What happened? What
happened? What happened? What happened?

362
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,929
What happened?

363
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,240
You should tell us what happened?

364
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,368
Lunch and all huh!

365
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,324
The Prague privilege.

366
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,640
Loser.. Loser.. Loser..

367
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,361
Mr. Bond is going
to Prague for his thesis.

368
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,526
That's not a joke.

369
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,566
Chandan.. Chandan.. Chandan..

370
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,885
Did someone call?

371
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,760
Could be Shubhangi.

372
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,323
Go check on her. She was so high.

373
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,965
Go Chandan..

374
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,162
I will go and see..

375
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,327
Yeah..

376
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,206
I will go.

377
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,441
Hmm..

378
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,803
It wasn't an imagination Chandan..

379
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,649
You did not see things.

380
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,166
I did?

381
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,568
You've seen Shubhangi with Gulshan.

382
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,645
I know. I saw it happen.

383
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,801
What happened?

384
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,210
Lighting up An'i's cigarette man.

385
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,884
Where is he, this side or that side.

386
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,846
What are you doing?

387
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,527
Meet the doctor and
Continue the medicines.

388
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,601
OK?

389
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,450
An'i is dead.

390
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,726
It's ok man.

391
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,527
No. It's not ok!

392
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,881
For a moment I
thought, why is he doing all this?

393
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,331
What's the need to do this?

394
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,564
Is he trying to
prove a point or something?

395
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,568
Why? -We can't smoke here.

396
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,366
An'i is dead and
this is a deadly disease.

397
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,650
C'mon, it's been a year
since he died. You know it..

398
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,131
...you have to get over it.

399
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,561
We are going to Prague dude.

400
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,767
Let it be just two of us. You and I..

401
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,401
OK..

402
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,806
...no An'i.

403
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:22,565
"My dreams got shattered."

404
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,682
"This heart pines for you."

405
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,684
Is it in Bangla as well?

406
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,970
You know if you fu** a girl..

407
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,251
...you might get her..

408
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,606
...you might not get her.

409
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,648
But if you mind fu** her..

410
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,168
...you are definitely gonna get her.

411
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,760
He is talking about Shubhangi.

412
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,561
I know.

413
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,563

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,649

It's a nice house.

416

It was quite a good
film. Good story. Good actors.

483
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,962
Trams in Kolkata are so different.

485
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,251

Can I have your number?

503
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,924

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,403
Why are you making such faces.

542
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,769
What face? -This face..

543
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,649
What this face? -Look at this.

544
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,727
You see this tone?

545
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,484
This tone and this face.

546
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,403
I don't want to talk to you.

547
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,331
Old trick hunh!

548
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,404
You can't use this trick you know..

549
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,930
You are just trying to
make me feel bad. That's it.

550
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,691
You want me to go.

551
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,166
No.

552
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,765
No, you just want me to leave.

553
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,921
Shall I?

554
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,167
Why do you become like this? -Like what?

555
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,964
Unreasonable.. I mean..

556
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,890
What is your problem with Lucien?

557
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,083
Why don't you want me
to meet Lucien? -Ohh, my god.

558
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,408
It's all about that. Ohh,
my god. It's all about that.

559
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,929
You are pissed because of that.

560
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,881
I am not pissed. I am disappointed.

561
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,684
With you, everything is so uncertain.

562
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,489
You can say, anything, do whatever.

563
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,564
Sometimes this. Sometimes
that. I don't want to talk now.

564
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,364
I want to go. I gotta
do this, I gotta do that.

565
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,165
What does it have to do with
Lucien? -Everything. -Everything.

566
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,171
Look at your state,
look at your behavior.

567
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,248
You can do anything, anytime man.

568
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,321
See!

569
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,441
I mean..

570
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,767
You mean? -I don't
want you to be with Lucien.

571
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,921
He is your Ex girl..

572
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,962
...you have got
nothing to do with him anymore?

573
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,251
I am trying to help you here.

574
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,322
Sort your life. -And mind.

575
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,602
And the character" -You wrote it?

576
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,120
Yeah I wrote it, I wrote it
but we are working on it together.

577
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,571
So imagine this"

578
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,680
"what do you get when you
cross a sheep and a crocodile?

579
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,931
A Sheepodile.. -Lucien..

580
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,681
A sheepodile.. You get a
sheepodile, it's beautiful.

581
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,205
Whats the crocodile part?

582
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,566
Crocodile is the head..

583
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,530
...bit of tail
sticking out, green feet as well.

584
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,410
But otherwise the
body is like a sheep so..

585
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,205
Anything else?

586
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,571
A Cappuccino.

587
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,648
More beer please.

588
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,611
Hey that reminds me, I have got a joke..

589
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,684
This boy comes back from
school.. Gypsy boy you know..

590
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,246
...and his dad says.. So
how was your day at school son..

591
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,085
He says -Well, you know it
was really good dad.. you know.

592
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,645
Because today we learned the alphabets.

593
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,842
Everybody else learned halfway up to M..

594
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,848
Me, I learned the whole alphabet.

595
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,848
So he said, well, you
know son that's just natural..

596
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,362
...you know, gypsies are
clever and you should be proud.

597
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,891
So boy comes back from school.

598
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,570
So how was today son?

599
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,524
Today.. Oh dad I am proud of myself..

600
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,843
Because today we
looked at each other's penises..

601
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,126
...and all the other boys.. phew.

602
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,762
This size.. really..
like this Just nothing.

603
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,650
And me.. yeah! I mean.. Maybe..

604
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,926
And hair and everything.

605
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,846
He said well..

606
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,811
Well son, you know, you
shouldn't be proud of that.

607
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,168
...after all you are 20
years old and they are 7.

608
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,891
Why are you laughing?

609
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,081
We are just talking.

610
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,448
What the hell.. you are
not talking you are being mean.

611
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,129
You Lucien, what do you get
out of it, making fun of people?

612
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,566
But being mean to whom..

613
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,768
I mean there are no gypsies around here.

614
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,485
I mean you are not a gypsy.. are you?

615
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,846
No he is not but he
could have been.. you know.

616
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,850
Gypsies are from India.
- No actually she is right.

617
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,131
This is all about power.

618
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,885
When we make fun of lesser
people, we want to feel powerful.

619
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,169
But I don't need power, I don't power.

620
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,083
I don't need to
make myself feel important.

621
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,886
I mean what the hell.

622
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,890
What was that?

623
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,521
Cheers..

624
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,483
Hey.. -Cheers.

625
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,443
Namaste.. Nasd ravie! -Peace..

626
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,124
Tell me what do you see?

627
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,568
I see a man trying to hide something.

628
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,120
Well the thing with the robe man is..

629
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,885
...what you see is what you actually are.

630
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,122
So what did you see
when you were here last time?

631
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,923
Ummm.. I saw a woman giving birth.

632
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,281
Were you pregnant?

633
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,286
Nooo. I was just
scared of getting pregnant..

634
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,841
You know.

635
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,801
When I was in India, I
visited some of the Gypsy tribes.

636
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,850
It's so sad how they are treated..

637
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,881
It's really sad..

638
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,844
Well, I think you are very
sensitive and you are very Humane..

639
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,370
That's what I liked about you.

640
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,126
Even here they are
discriminated against.

641
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,569
I mean we have to do
something. -When I saw you with Lucien..

642
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,931
...I was wondering, why are you with him?

643
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,849
You don't really discriminate. do you?

644
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,449
But it's not my space but I
was thinking that I will ask you.

645
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,849
And the reason I
agreed to this photo shoot..

646
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,530
...Is that it was done in gypsy style.

647
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,967
So, I thought it will be so much fun!

648
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,730
You know the first time I saw you..

649
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,285
I thought you were astonishing.

650
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,566
You were..

651
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,684
You were astonishing!

652
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,531
Before I could say anything"

653
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,971
You left with the chair..

654
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,891
You know there are so
many World War <i>ll</i> memorials..

655
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,281
But there is nothing for the gypsies.

656
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,846
And then I saw you in
the tram" -You were sitting"

657
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,521
And I was thinking, what
should I say.. where do I start.

658
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,364
Then you again
disappeared.. its good that we met.

659
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,488
You are an architect.
why don't you do something?

660
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,848
I mean you can do something.

661
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,124
Like a memorial for the
free spirit of the gypsies.

662
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,886
What do you think?

663
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,290
Okay. -Yea.. really?

664
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,441
Yeah..

665
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,362
You can't even pronounce my name right?

666
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,487
Ofcourse I do.

667
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,686
ChanDan..

668
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,205
No no no no..

669
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,851
Ohh.. give I up now..

670
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,571
I won't give up. I would not give up.

671
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,841
I never give up.

672
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,370
Chandan.

673
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,127
Again you did it..

674
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,850
It's not Chandan..

675
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,726
Got it? Try again.. Chandan.

676
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,649
Chandan.

677
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,721
Chandan.

678
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,728
Na.. ummm.. hmmmm..

679
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,881
ChanDan..

680
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,131
ChanDan..

681
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,362
Correct. see you got I right.

682
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,522
The last two were perfect.

683
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,649
So good! -Why are you getting
involved Chandan? -Don't lie to me..

684
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,966
...I know I wasn't right.

685
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,925
No I am not lying o
you.. . You were correct.

686
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,526
No.. I know.. I am not.

687
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,961
You are inviting
trouble man.. . Can't you see?

688
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,043
You are just inviting
trouble into your life..

689
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,211
I am telling it was
right Elena.. it was correct.

690
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,966
Why do you want to
repeat the Shubhangi chapter bro?

691
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,408
You know I had this
girl friend called Shubhangi..

692
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,323
And she could never get her name right.

693
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,447
How stupid is that?

694
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,370
I am sure you kept troubling her
all the time.. -to get it correct..

695
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,165
No, I never did that. I never do that.

696
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,447
Hello.. Hello..

697
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,686
Hello.. you here?

698
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,886
Yea.

699
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,366
Your landlady
tortured me just for a key.

700
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,882
By the way.. you know
lam not your girl friend.

701
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,490
Of course.. you are not.

702
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,484
Well, I thought I will just clarify.

703
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,648
Because you referred
to your ex-girl friend.

704
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,529
And then you talked about me..

705
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,444
Good you did that.

706
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,650
Well, have you thought
anything about the gypsy memorial?

707
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,691
Can I speak to you later?

708
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,405
Sure call me later.

709
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,086
OK.

710
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,765
<i>Bye. -Bye-.</i>

711
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,761
When did you come?

712
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,967
Nice room..

713
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,330
Sexy set up man..

714
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,565
Where did you find this board?

715
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,846
This?

716
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,882
Didn't find it, I purchased it.

717
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,884
Nice room man.. . I
can stay here all my life.

718
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,841
So what's your plan for tomorrow? .

719
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,203
Couldn't you get another car?

720
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,763
Land lady gave it for free..

721
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,206
"What else do you want?

722
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,130
What's there in Kutna Hora?

723
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,931
Bone chapel.

724
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,803
Made in 18th century.

725
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,485
With the bones from the cemetery"

726
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,289
...all the stacked bones.

727
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,369
It's a wonderful piece of architecture"

728
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,885
This is awesome!

729
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,125
How did they join the bones ya?

730
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,090
How these bones are joined?

731
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,971
Even after making so much..

732
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,287
"They had to stack so many bones man..

733
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,970
I think they should have made a floor.

734
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,484
Are you really an architect?

735
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,127
It won't have been
possible to walk on the bones.. C'mon.

736
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,007
Who walks on bones?

737
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,250
You know, I think
the guy who made this"

738
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,926
"must have thought at least once..

739
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,121
...to make the statue out of bones too.

740
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,761
You mean instead of statue,
statue of skeleton on the cross.

741
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,281
Yeah I think they
must have thought of that.

742
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,607
What I am saying how
he got it out of his system.

743
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,721
This.

744
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,444
He couldn't make the statue..

745
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,841
"But he left this cross of bones.

746
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,364
I am sure he wanted to
put a statue of bones on it..

747
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,522
"But they didn't let him.

748
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,321
No?

749
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,886
Nice.. it's a funny theory man.

750
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,284
Yeah it seems.. funny.

751
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,928
Hey what are you guys talking?

752
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,204
I am getting scared.

753
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,320
Who says this city is spooky?

754
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,848
Such a nice beautiful place man.

755
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,962
Since the day I am searching for one..

756
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,163
...normal looking girl
amidst a sea of beautiful girls.

757
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,770
But no, all the girls are so bloody hot.

758
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,610
Thought about the
project? I have some ideas.

759
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,888
I think we should
stick to our original plan.

760
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,171
Rain rain go away..

761
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,642
...my little Gulshan wants to play.

762
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,690
Girls are distraction.

763
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,166
Check her out!

764
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,291
Let's go..

765
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,806
What happened?

766
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,961
She is not bad.

767
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,091
Weird.

768
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,127
You really are not
interested in this gypsy thing.

769
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,282
Only because of that
girl you are entertaining.

770
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,526
"The gypsy idea Chandan.

771
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,927
Listen to me, just
give it up. Both of them!

772
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,448
This is a masterpiece.

773
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,807
Dude, this is a bloody masterpiece!

774
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,810
Because of her, whatever you
want to achieve in architecture.

775
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,291
You won't be able to do it.

776
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,970
This city is so much like you.

777
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,367
Do you see anything common in them?

778
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,846
No.

779
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,450
You know their human
perception is fu***d up.

780
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,646
According to them"

781
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,808
...the entire human
race is troubled or bothered.

782
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,127
I mean, see the kind
of things they make man.

783
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,205
This man, someone
else sitting on his head.

784
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,964
Like An'i on your head?

785
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,440
And..

786
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,406
This one..

787
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,728
...he got into a robe
to hide from the world and..

788
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,330
...and then disappeared into the robe.

789
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,050
Architecture is your robe!

790
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,050
She will see through
you Chandan. Very soon.

791
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,566
She will see through you.

792
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,730
Even he is just like you.

793
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,962
He wanted kill himself
by jumping off the window..

794
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,809
"But changed the
plans at the last minute.

795
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,120
That's you all the time.

796
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,087
She will see in you
what Gulshan sees in you man..

797
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,884
She will see in you
what Gulshan sees in you.

798
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,968
Just shut up and leave An'i.

799
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,406
Shut up.

800
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,291
Hey calm down bro.

801
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,521
"When your steps echoed in the streets."

802
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,086
"Everything started losing its shape."

803
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,883
"Houses, statues and towers.“

804
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:21,405
"Are hidden in the mist now."

805
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,487
"Nothing but a river and its flow."

806
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,682
"And you and me on its banks."

807
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,961
Hello..

808
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,525
Hello..

809
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,921
Yes?

810
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,327
Your girl has come? -What?

811
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:19,764
Your girl has is here. She is down.

812
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,610
Girl? What girl dude?

813
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,849
Are you going around with someone dude?

814
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,967
What?

815
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,886
Who is she looking for?

816
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,570
She is calling Chandan, Chandan.

817
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,211
What is your name?

818
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,327
Chandan?

819
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,801
Yes. -I will call her..

820
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,450
No No.. I will go down.

821
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,564
You will go down on her?

822
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,966
Where are you going?

823
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,884
My grandmother's house.

824
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,441
Why?

825
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,410
Why? Am I going away?

826
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,971
Where the hell have..

827
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,690
...you been all this while? Tell me..

828
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,483
...I have called you hundreds of times.

829
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,124
And you never pick up!

830
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,280
I was worried.

831
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,885
I was worried about you.

832
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,844
Really.. you know.

833
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,044
Are you Okay?

834
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,962
What language was that?

835
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,969
OK. See..

836
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,842
That day when you came.
You only punched 8 digits.

837
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,041
Where was the ninth?

838
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,447
See, I still remember your number was..

839
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:02,447
...7.. 8.. 5.. 4.. 6.. 1.. 9..

840
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,081
..."Drip, drip, drip..“

841
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,204
That's the ice melting"

842
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,841
"Like rain under the drain
and again for the last time."

843
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,806
"The pool ripples."

844
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,441
"There's mud under your feet."

845
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,407
"Your neck is cold."

846
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,202
"Again you're
standing in the rain alone."

847
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,441
"Drip, drip, drip."

848
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,730
"That's the ice melting."

849
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,242
"Like rain under the drain
and again for the last time."

850
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,366
"They're going to pass by."

851
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,968
"Pretending not to see you."

852
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,242
"Anyway there's only one nice one."

853
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,088
"But he's a little tipsy."

854
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,247
"Drip, drip, drip..“

855
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,291
That's the ice melting."

856
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,326
"Like rain under the drain
and again for the last time."

857
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:53,926
"He still has some
Vermouth left waiting for him"

858
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,842
"He's afraid of you, girl."

859
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,921
"Don't be down anymore."

860
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,126
"Drip, drip, drip."

861
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,970
"That's the ice melting."

862
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,841
"Like rain under the drain
and again for the last time."

863
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:27,526
"Something will come
out of this grey rainy day."

864
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,801
"There is fire on the roof."

865
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,601
"Light candles for us please."

866
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,442
"Shoulders trembling."

867
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,049
"You're a little drunk on the light."

868
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,166
"And he is drunk on you."

869
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,570
"When you're polishing
off the bottle in silence."

870
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,407
"Your feet are still cold."

871
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,969
"Go on and turn the door handle."

872
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,966
ls there a problem?

873
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,128
No. Just the usual.

874
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,401
Ok. Keep it down.

875
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,164
Yeah.

876
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,689
When you talk to your friends about me.

877
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,881
Talk to them in
English or Bangla or in..

878
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,081
...some language which I understand Ok..

879
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,884
"Don't talk to them in
any language I don't follow..

880
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,410
...that means you are
trying to hide something from me.

881
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,807
You are an airwwwe! _What?

882
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,330
Now you understand? -What?

883
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,362
You have made it
impossible for me to speak to you.

884
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,050
Because You are .

885
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,241
Ohh.. So I am annoyed all all the time?

I am annoying you all the time?

887
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,844
You are annoyed with me all
the time, that's what you mean.

888
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,962
Yeah.. because you
are fu****g annoying me.

889
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,401
Ok.. -What did I tell
you about the relationship.

890
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,283
How many have
counted the moles on your body?

891
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,010
You are like any other Indian men!

892
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,371
See.. See..

893
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,121
I can't trust you.

894
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,481
And who is this Indian
man you are talking about?

895
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,726
Who is this man.. C'mon
tell me.. who is this man..

896
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,967
Ohh my god.. -Who is this
man? -Chandan you.. -What.. What?

897
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,729
How does it matter?

898
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,042
Keep it quite Elena.

899
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,442
This is how it ended
between me and Shubhangi..

900
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,928
This what shubhangi did to me.

901
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,883
You want to control me..

902
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,849
I know what you want from me.

903
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,930
I exactly know.

904
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,561
Happy?

905
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,200
Why do you have to go?

906
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,804
Because I have to go.

907
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,360
Why do you have to go?

908
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,931
Because I want to go..

909
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,964
...you are busy with your
project and I am useless here..

910
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,320
...so I have to go.

911
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,688
You have a new play coming up na?

912
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,490
I don't want to do it.

913
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,131
Why don't you want to do it?

914
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:48,848
Because I want to go
to my grandmothers house.

915
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,600
Don't go na..

916
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,121
I am going. -Please!

917
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,166
<i>L</i> am going-

918
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,166
Sing it again.

919
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,487
No.

920
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,081
<i>Sum; nan.</i>

921
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,121
No.

922
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,201
Sing.

923
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,841
Please..

924
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,606
Don't go!

925
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,126
I have to go.

926
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,161
No.

927
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,125
I don't see a point.

928
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,640
Just because of that girl.

929
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,768
Why do you want to make
a monument about the gypsies?

930
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,531
Our idea about the world
war victim's monument is good.

931
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,961
Out of all, you are
talking about dead people..

932
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,248
Do you really care about dead people?

933
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,684
You are the one who
cares about the dead fu***r!

934
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,609
I see An'ie..

935
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,251
...and I am okay with his
death. -I don't really miss him..

936
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,567
If you don't miss
him, then why do you see him?

937
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,807
I see him, which
is why I don't miss him.

938
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,209
And the one you don't see
these days, do you miss them?

939
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,371
I guess.

940
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,566
A little bit.

941
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:05,046
Even if you don't
miss them, show that you do.

942
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,726
Nice.. Very nice.

943
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,889
How long will this silent therapy go on?

944
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,362
How long is this gonna go on?

945
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,927
But I can't manage
without talking to you.

946
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,287
Now what?

947
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,011
Actually, I think I will stick to the"

948
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,731
...second world war memorial monument.

949
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,249
I don't feel right
about the gypsy memorial idea.

950
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,970
It's just not happening.

951
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,721
What happened?

952
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,210
What happened? What happened?

953
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,205
My Grandmother was Gypsy!

954
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,370
She was in a
concentration camp during world war ll.

955
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,841
So..

956
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,721
...are you a gypsy?

957
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,961
Yeah.

958
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,402
I am And you know it was our own people.

959
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,324
Czech people who were
running the concentration camp.

960
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,363
Not the Nazi Germans.

961
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,849
It's a conspiracy.

962
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,362
They wanted to get rid of the gypsies.

963
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,610
In Lety, there is a mass grave where..

964
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,205
...some of my ancestors are buried.

965
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,167
We should make the
Gypsy memorial Gulshan.

966
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,129
Man, it's again about that chick!

967
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,850
It's not about Elena man.

968
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,046
During world war..

969
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:35,442
"The Czech army
tortured and killed the gypsies.

970
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,129
And the Czech government
claimed that it's Hitler's doing.

971
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,331
"Hitler's voice".

972
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,849
Do you know that Gypsies were actually.

973
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,206
...lndians who settled here.

974
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,368
And the local people hated them man.

975
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,850
And all over the world..

976
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,924
...there are monuments
for the world war victims.

977
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,044
But nothing for Gypsies.

978
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,803
The place where the Gypsies were buried.

979
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,081
That place is now being used as
a pig farm by the Czech government.

980
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,963
They are breeding
pigs on top of their graves.

981
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,923
And if there is even the
slightest truth in this conspiracy..

982
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,327
...then there should
be a monument for Gypsies!

983
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:09,041
"Gypsy anthem"

984
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,442
Nice man, I like the top view.

985
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,211
Will you have some coffee?

986
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,563
Sure.

987
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,363
Relax. I am not taking your credit away.

988
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,964
Okay, I will come
back, I will come back later"

989
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,605
It's amazing.

990
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,729
But what exactly is it?

991
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,928
It's a memorial for Gypsies here.

992
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,969
For all the dead souls.

993
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,928
I call it 'The Soul Chapel.'

994
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,522
I was inspired by your story"

995
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,566
Whatever you told me
about your family history.

996
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,564
And it's all because of you.

997
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,361
This is for you.

998
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,325
Are you trying to hug me?

999
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,401
Yea.

1000
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,724
Then I should make the best out of it.

1001
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,403
You have got ten
seconds to figure out where it is.

1002
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,164
I am just joking.. .relax!

1003
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,283
How many moles are there on your body?

1004
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,847
I don't know..

1005
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,488
"But I know people who do.

1006
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,602
You are crazy Chandan. -So are you.

1007
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,326
Why did you say all that?

1008
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,481
Say what?

1009
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,681
Say what?

1010
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,364
The whole mole thing.

1011
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,249
What do you want to prove with that?

1012
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,281
Chandan..

1013
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,402
Chandan will do
what? What will Chandan do?

1014
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,447
Why are you so judgmental?

1015
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,801
I am judgemental?

1016
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,211
Yes. I am leaving.

1017
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,969
You are the one who is
talking about men, I am not.

1018
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,525
You are asking me..
- You are not going anywhere..

1019
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,722
I am going.. I am
going.. -Hello!! -Elena..

1020
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,925
I am not judgmental..

1021
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,721
Elena!!!

1022
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,200
"And hope that in the..“

1023
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,762
Morning he forgets to breathe."

1024
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:12,323
"While he watches you
covertly when you sleep."

1025
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,688
Shubhangi messed it man!!

1026
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,925
Shubhangi dumped me!

1027
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,287
It's ok.. it happens.

1028
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,771
I love her. It's not ok man..

1029
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,729
This is why you were
with that handicapped guy.

1030
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,164
You always need a
weak person around you..

1031
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,811
...to feel stronger..

1032
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,407
Chandan.. what's wrong with me..

1033
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,606
Why did she dump me?

1034
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,324
There is nothing wrong
with you. Nobody dumped you.

1035
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,204
It's ok. You deserved it
man. -You should know it. Be a man.

1036
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,204
I am with you because I..
- Because you want to feel powerful.

1037
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,928
Which is why you were stuck with me..

1038
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,485
Nobody needs you.. -Why
are you talking like this to me..

1039
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,407
...we are friends. -One minute.

1040
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,851
No body is nobody's
friend here. You are not my friend.

1041
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,928
I am not your friend
Nobody is nobody's friend.

1042
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,724
You know what you are?
You are a fu****g parasite.

1043
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,410
I'm not a parasite. -I take
care of you -Ofcourse you are parasite.

1044
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,930
Look at your state,
you are fu****g parasite.

1045
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,964
What are you saying? -You.. and you.

1046
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,169
Both of you are parasites.

1047
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,884
You miserable f**k!!

1048
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,965
Chandan I love you.. -What chandan!!

1049
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,690
Chandan who? -Chandan!!

1050
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,330
What will Chandan do Motherf****r!!

1051
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,608
Chandan is a free-bee,
everybody gets one extra!!

1052
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,886
You think I am an idiot!

1053
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,605
Irrelevant fu****g dumb fool!!

1054
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,691
You need me, and you needed me.

1055
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,721
But I don't need any of you.

1056
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,689
Nobody needs you
- Shubhangi doesn't need you.

1057
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,722
I don't need you.. No
one look at your fu****g state.

1058
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,888
Who the hell are you
talking to you. There's nobody here!

1059
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,649
You are weak which
is why you are with me.

1060
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,884
That is why she is
attracted to handicapped people. Right!

1061
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,451
And you..

1062
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,961
I don't need anybody.

1063
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,161
I am stronger.

1064
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,129
I am way stronger than both of you.

1065
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,201
I know.

1066
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,723
It's Ok. -Yeah, I know it's Ok..

1067
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,649
"Nothing is wrong,
it's all Ok.. it's all fine..

1068
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,684
It's Ok. -yeah yeah.. -But you
should know.. you should know that. .

1069
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,324
I know, I am sorry..

1070
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,921
I am sorry.

1071
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,361
I am sorry.

1072
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,401
You are right.

1073
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,970
You are stronger than me..

1074
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,961
"Way stronger..

1075
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:48,282
..."What a world!"

1076
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:03,286
"What a world I live in!"

1077
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:08,247
"This ambience is exotic."

1078
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,210
Have I ever told
you about my friend Arfi?

1079
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,327
The one who jumped
from the window and died?

1080
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,530
When I make this monument.

1081
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,888
I will make sure there are no windows..

1082
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,327
So, troubled people can't jump off?

1083
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,927
If you invite
troubled people to a place.

1084
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,524
You make sure.

1085
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,967
That they don't find an
exit before they find peace.

1086
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:48,044
"Why is this bond entangled?"

1087
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:58,327
"With magic, I unravel your mind."

1088
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:05,484
"So give me your hand now."

1089
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,809
"So that we can jump to the current."

1090
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,050
"Or we can talk."

1091
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,721
"And our words."

1092
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,243
"Like pieces of bread."

1093
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:27,280
"We can give to the swans."

1094
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,970
Man, can I ask you a question?

1095
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,281
Go ahead.

1096
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,891
Well, leave it.

1097
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,921
<i>OK.</i>

1098
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,087
I mean, you don't really care.. do you?

1099
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,567
Look at that.

1100
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,801
I mean, I was saying that I
wanted to tell you something.

1101
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,244
Which is that I have a question to ask..

1102
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,403
"But I won't be able to ask.

1103
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,805
I mean.. did you really kiss Elena..

1104
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,609
I don't want to
know, I don't want answers..

1105
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,846
But..

1106
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,810
I won't be able to ask.

1107
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,363
Ask me the day you
can, and I will tell you.

1108
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,088
That day she looked agreeable An'i.

1109
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,325
Do you feel like jumping?

1110
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,929
But I think she loves me.

1111
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,850
She does.

1112
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,126
You know, sometimes
when you are next to a pool.

1113
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,884
You get the urge to jump..

1114
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,284
Don't you just feel like jumping?

1115
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,289
I didn't want you to die An'i.

1116
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,201
I surely did not.

1117
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,324
I did not want you to die man.

1118
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,965
I am sorry I lost you.

1119
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,930
But, I don't want to lose Elena..

1120
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,845
I don't want to.

1121
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,082
But, I think she loves me..

1122
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,566
...and she will be with me.

1123
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,123
So what was she doing
with Gulshan in the tram?

1124
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,211
Don't you think she becomes
nice to you when she is guilty?

1125
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,248
I am not going tojump man!

1126
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,084
I am not going to jump.

1127
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,720
Why should I jump?

1128
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,208
But whether she loves me
or not, I will find that out.

1129
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,929
What is it? Tell me.

1130
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,371
What is it.

1131
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,081
...Chandan..

1132
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,601
Tell me.. -Tell you what?

1133
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,202
What is it.. -Nothing I just wanted to..

1134
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,567
You want what?

1135
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,284
I want you to come over.

1136
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,486
Happy Birthday to you".

1137
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,246
Happy Birthday to you".

1138
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,165
Happy Birthday dear Elena..

1139
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,409
Happy Birthday to you".

1140
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,730
I love you all..

1141
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,121
You know?

1142
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:16,607
There is one more
thing missing in this model..

1143
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,607
Tell me.

1144
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,688
You know what? You know what?

1145
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,123
That's love...

1146
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,811
Love solves everything.

1147
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,881
This model needs a love point.

1148
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,682
Where every troubled man
and woman meet to love each other.

1149
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,683
How many troubled women do you know?

1150
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,483
Only one.

1151
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,849
All the women I know
are the ones who are troubled!

1152
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,363
We need alcohol.

1153
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,170
You are right.

1154
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,090
You are right.

1155
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,448
You are so bloody right.

1156
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,968
We need a bar in here.

1157
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,921
Yes, that's what we need.

1158
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:06,445
Make a bar in the
monument and name it, Pain BARRED.

1159
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,724
I think we need..

1160
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,081
...more beer.

1161
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,725
I think we need you.

1162
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,167
No baby.

1163
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,560
You will needme
more, after you'll have beer.

1164
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,127
C'mon Chandan..

1165
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,967
No, so I'll go and get some beer.

1166
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:50,682
"So show me the way
to the next whisky bar."

1167
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,600
"Don't ask why..“

1168
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,804
"No don't ask why..“

1169
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,840
Ohh man..

1170
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,281
I knowl knowl know.

1171
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,202
I don't know..

1172
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:12,969
I don't know why she keeps
bickering about the gypsies man.

1173
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,290
I don't know..

1174
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,921
She..

1175
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,449
...has got problems man.

1176
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:31,881
Serious serious troubles.

1177
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,730
She's got problems huh?

1178
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,284
She's got problems!

1179
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,929
Why are you taking the risk?

1180
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,961
Because it's important to take risk.

1181
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,201
My friend.

1182
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:02,727
A good architect
should always take risks.

1183
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,211
I knew it..

1184
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,251
I knew it!!

1185
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,366
Yeah..

1186
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,051
Vod ka.. whisky.. beer?

1187
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,162
Shots of absolute" two!

1188
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,928
You don't speak much Czech hunh?

1189
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:21,767
No.

1190
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,561
Enjoy.. thanks!

1191
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,201
You want?

1192
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,367
You want?

1193
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,241
If you want more..

1194
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,567
...we can go out" it's too loud here.

1195
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,726
Cheers!

1196
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,246
Come here..

1197
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,364
You look tired" huh..

1198
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,961
You looks so tired.

1199
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,525
This is hilarious..

1200
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,406
Look at this.

1201
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,927
People think that you are gay.

1202
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,808
What the fu** are you..

1203
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,606
I am not gay..

1204
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,251
I am not gay..

1205
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,721
I am not gay you mother fu****

1206
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,162
I am not gay you mother fu****

1207
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,160
She loves me!

1208
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,761
Elena.

1209
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,081
Elena.

1210
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:21,967
Elena.

1211
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,284
I don't wan to talk to you..

1212
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,767
Elena.

1213
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,281
Hello.

1214
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,807
Hi.

1215
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,766
Elena.

1216
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,125
I wanted to talk to you.

1217
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,403
Even I wanted to talk to you.

1218
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,207
About what?

1219
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,080
Chandan.

1220
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,960
I am pregnant.

1221
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,965
Chandan, are you
listening? Are you listening?

1222
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,969
Did you hear what I said?

1223
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,248
But why the fu** are
you telling me all this?

1224
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,291
Call Gulshan and tell him that.

1225
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,970
And I am not coming home tonight.

1226
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,161
Hey"

1227
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,801
Hello.

1228
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:16,331
Don't you ever dare to
touch my model ever again.

1229
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,521
Leave that.

1230
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,767
Dude, the project is mine too.

1231
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,251
What your project?

1232
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,287
Huh?

1233
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,122
Nothing was ever
yours nor it will be.. got it?

1234
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,562
Getting all crazy is not going to help.

1235
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,921
It's all your fault. -What fault?

1236
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,925
What fault?

1237
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,686
You used my lesson on a wrong person.

1238
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,970
You didn't need to control Elena.

1239
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,486
And you didn't want to love
her, you wanted to control her.

1240
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:43,926
She loved you.

1241
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,450
She cared for you.

1242
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,284
You should have loved her man.

1243
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,841
This is what you do
to people who love you.

1244
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,367
I loved you Chandan, why
did you do this to me brother?

1245
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,802
I loved you too. I love Elena too.

1246
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,729
I wanted you to take care
of me after shubhangi dumped me.

1247
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,125
I surely did I did. -You did not.

1248
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,322
You did not! -I fell because of you.

1249
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,243
Elena came close to me because of you.

1250
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:05,681

Hey Gulshan.

I think I have silenced An'i.

1282
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:27,968
I think he has
forgiven me.. you think so?

1283
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,404
Huh? -What?

1284
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,129
I think he has forgiven me..

1285
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,762
I don't think Arfie
is going to come back.

1286
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,681

"I am lost and desolate."
