<i>The first breath gives us life,</i>

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,292
<i>Whatever good or bad</i>

3
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,458
<i>Between the first</i>

4
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:25,000

5
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:29,333

00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,375
WELCOME TO THE
MUNICIPAL CORPORATION - ONGOLE.

7
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,792
FLOCK OF EAGLES.

8
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,708
What happened, brother?

9
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,917
-Who's inside?
-Madam.

10
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,667
What happened?

11
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,208
We got into a fight with someone.

12
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,000
It was nasty.

13
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,708
Before we could respond,
we were surrounded by people.

14
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:25,625
Which village?

15
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:26,917
Chirrikurapadu, madam.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,208
When death is upon you, the ears cannot
hear good things.

17
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:31,917
That is their fate.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is brother at home?

19
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,458
Why will he be at home?

20
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,042
Are you looking for a
good time to step out?

21
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:39,750
Don't you know that...

22
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,375
before the news reaches us,
he will be on his way.

23
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:47,250
If anyone dares lay a hand
on anyone from Gaddala Gunta...

24
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,208
CHIRRIKURAPADU.

25
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,292
Who are you?

26
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,042
Oh God!

27
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,833
Who are you?
What happened, sir?

28
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,500
Sir, sir... please let him go.

29
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,708
Father! Father!

30
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,083
Look at him.

31
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,000
Sir... please let my son go.

32
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,458
Sir...
Please let my son go.

33
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,583
Why are you beating
a man from our village?

34
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,542
Sir... sir... please let him go.

35
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,792
Radha! Gaddala Gunta Radha!

36
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,875
If someone still wants to be a hero,

37
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,875
if you need fertilizers
for your farms...

38
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,917
if your children have to study,

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,750
or even if you have to go to the
hospital, you will have to come to Ongole!

40
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:05,708
No one, who comes there, will ever return!
If anyone retaliates here,

41
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,333
your head will be in
the backyard of my house

42
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,625
and the rest of your body
will be in your village!

43
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:18,333
Please let him go.
Sir, sir... looks like he may die.

44
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,333
Please let him go.
Sir, he didn't know what he was doing.

45
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,833
Please let him go.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,375
Because you are telling me that he
didn't know what he was doing...

47
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,167
I am letting him go
without killing him.

48
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,917
Otherwise...

49
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,167
BEACH ROAD.

50
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,542
Why did you stop here?

51
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,833
I’ll go get a bottle of water.

52
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,375
-What do you want?
-A bottle of water.

53
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,292
Okay.

54
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,042
Anything else?

55
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,167
I want some condoms.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
BEACH ROAD.

57
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,625
What's going on?
You said we will go out for a bit of fun.

58
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,333
-Oh God.
-Please wait.

59
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,083
-Please.
-Please. Come on.

60
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,250
-Please, dear.
-This is not the right thing to do.

61
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,083
-I don’t like coming out with you.
-Nothing will happen.

62
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,208
Leave me! Leave me!

63
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,667
Hey!
If you scream, I’ll kill him!

64
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,500
Please... leave her.

65
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:11,833
But you let him sleep late.
And you wake me up early in the morning.

66
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,208
Why, mother?

67
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,000
Darling, give this to your father.
I’ll make a breakfast for you.

68
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:16,917
Go.

69
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,917
Why did they send Kumaran
Sri Ramachandra away?

70
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,500
Think about it.

71
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,792
Dad, please have some coffee.

72
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,625
What is this?

73
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
How can he send his
own son to the forest?

74
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,750
What, dear?

75
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,500
Why can’t you let the TV be?
He is preaching morals.

76
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,333
What?
And, they call these morals?

77
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,500
How can anyone send
their son to the forest?

78
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,292
I won’t let my son even
cross our threshold.

79
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,583
Oh! Why do you care
about all that?

80
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,250
Just listen to the
moral of the story.

81
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,625
Watch some other stories.

82
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,250
They talk about morals
at other places as well.

83
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:52,667
Keep this on. Okay.
I love this show.

84
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,708
-I am going to get my books now.
-Come back soon. Okay.

85
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,417
Mom!

86
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,292
I am coming.

87
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:08,917
Oh! Is the sun
disturbing my son?

88
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,208
What is it, dear?

89
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:16,417
Hey, why are you screaming like that
when our small child is sleeping?

90
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,417
-Small child?
-Yes.

91
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,250
Wake him up.
It’s already late.

92
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,917
Hey, the longer he sleeps,
the better it is for his health.

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,458
Did your son tell you this?

94
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Hey, Guna!
Are you still asleep?

95
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,083
There's a fight going on outside.

96
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:36,083
Son, don’t ruin
your sleep for them.

97
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,375
Enough! Shut up and go inside!

98
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,583
-What will you do?
-I’ll take care of you!

99
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,625
How dare you talk to
me with that attitude?

100
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,208
-I won’t hit you. I will kill you.
-What will you do? Hit me?

101
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,583
Stop. Stop.
Here take this.

102
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,375
Take it, I’ll explain.

103
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,917
This is perfect.
Now beat each other up.

104
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,333
Are you making fun of us?
What is this, Guna?

105
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:22,917
It is fun for whoever watches
people fighting. Not just for me, uncle.

106
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,625
Anyway,
what are you fighting about, uncle?

107
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,500
Hey, Guna, don’t you know how I
worked hard in my childhood?

108
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,167
How I struggled to educate him?

109
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,750
How I struggled to
get him married?

110
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,583
I asked two extra feet of the
property we are staying in, that’s it.

111
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,375
For that, he says he will kill
me, beat me up and stab me.

112
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,375
-What did you do?
-I, too, worked hard.

113
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,208
You are fighting about the property.
Okay. I finally got it.

114
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,000
It will be 70 to 80 lakhs.

115
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,833
It’s okay,
you can fight about it.

116
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,417
But after your fight,
you need to pay for it, uncle.

117
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,875
You will have to pay the police,
the courts, the lawyers...

118
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,375
the judges and the verdicts.

119
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,958
After going around
in circles for the next couple of years,

120
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,792
you are still in debt of
another seven to eight lakhs.

121
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,417
You will realize apart from spending
all the 70 to 80 lakhs,

122
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,417
nothing is left.

123
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,833
Expect animosity and grudge.

124
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:16,500
If you keep fighting...

125
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,833
not only will you lose the property
but everything else.

126
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,750
I don’t know how much
courage does money give a man.

127
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,583
But the courage another man can
give you is so much more than that.

128
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,917
Even if 100 people are against you,

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,292
you will find the courage
in knowing that...

130
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,958
it’s up to you. Fight! If you
want to let go of this kind of courage,

131
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,833
I am not responsible anymore.
You have to figure it out.

132
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,708
Anyway, I felt like saying
it, and I said it.

133
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,958
Ah! He’s my son.

134
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:56,958
He is the strength of our colony just like
a rock-solid wall. Guna is a man of morals

135
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,000
and he won’t let our
internal problems outside.

136
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,875
He won’t let the outside
problems inside these walls.

137
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,042
Is that all, uncle?

138
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,750
I like you.
But you may leave now.

139
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,833
What the hell!
Why is this so heavy?

140
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,250
Hey, did you start eating betel leaves
first thing in the morning?

141
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,500
-How dare you poke me!
-Hey, wait.

142
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,750
Leave me, leave me.

143
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,417
-Please listen me.
-Leave me.

144
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,583
Look at how she is poking me!

145
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,792
You are no less...
you are great...

146
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,458
otherwise, I would have killed you.
You are saved because of him.

147
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,875
Leave it. Let’s go.

148
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,583
Can’t you eat some rice as well?
By the way, why do you always eat leaves?

149
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,083
That one eats leaves.
And these people eat you.

150
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,333
What kind of society is this?

151
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,000
When we want people to look at
us, they won’t.

152
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,083
When we don’t want people
to look at us, they do.

153
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,417
-Hello, Mr. Subbarao.
-Hello, sir.

154
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,958
Change your clothes here.
You've come dressed up as a software guy

155
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:19,458
and you have a tag.
And I have to help you with it.

156
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,375
Why is that work not done?

157
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,167
-Go take care of that work.
-Well... I have to...

158
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,500
-Guna, are you done with the job?
-Yes, sir.

159
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,333
We need to export it to China.
Go to the quarry and select a stone.

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,208
Sir, I cannot come in
for the next two days.

161
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,375
How can you say that when
there is such a lot of work?

162
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,542
Well... I have B...

163
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,000
I have my B.Tech exams, sir.

164
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,625
I don’t know what exams you have been
attempting for the past two years.

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,500
What will you do after you pass the exam?
Anyway, how does it matter?

166
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,917
You are making 60 to 70 thousand rupees.

167
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,292
Do you intend to make
more money than that?

168
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,000
It is my dad’s wish to see a
B.Tech tag next to my name, sir.

169
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:01,292
And he’s waiting to display
it on the wall, sir.

170
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,375
That is why he has made a board with
"Guna B.Tech" written on it.

171
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,042
Will the board be displayed
this time at least?

172
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,792
I’m wondering about it as well.

173
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,083
Make sure the board
is finally displayed.

174
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,958
Somehow,
I have to write the exam.

175
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,542
Yeah.

176
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:20,542
Come. Come. Come to me the
10th question on the 10th page.

177
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,292
You are troubling me a lot.

178
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,417
Come.

179
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:28,917
Come to me.
Come.

180
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,583
Hey, Guna. Seems like this year
you will fail as well.

181
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,417
Destroy this inauspicious talk!

182
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,667
-Come. Come now.
-Guna, B.Tech.

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,208
-Come.
-Wow.

184
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,500
Come to me.

185
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,250
You are so close. Come here.

186
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,875
What is he doing?

187
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,417
You are here now. Come here.

188
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,250
What are these tantric rituals?

189
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,458
Enemies are trying
to disturb me.

190
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,250
But I can’t lose focus.
I will concentrate.

191
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,583
Mom, call her inside.

192
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:03,750
-Hey, go.
-Go!

193
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,042
Come to me.

194
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,625
Write well and
earn a degree.

195
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
Here’s your hall ticket.

196
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:13,917
Thank you, Dad.

197
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,458
Cross my path and wish me luck.
Why are you looking at me like that?

198
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:20,583
Oh no! Last time when I wished
you luck and you failed...

199
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:24,042
your father refused to speak to me
for three months. So, I won’t do it again.

200
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,833
-Please, let me be.
-You cross my path and wish me luck.

201
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,875
He stopped talking with
Mom, but he hit me...

202
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,667
and wish me luck.
Okay, at least you cross my path.

203
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,167
And I don’t have a problem wishing you
luck, but it’s not nice when men do it.

204
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,292
That’s it.

205
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,250
Let's see... if anyone comes
and wish you luck.

206
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,125
Wait.
Listen to me.

207
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,875
Did you scare all of them, Dad?

208
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,750
They are getting scared themselves.
I did not scare them.

209
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,042
Anyway, why do you need anyone
to cross your path and wish you luck?

210
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,292
They need to be
fortunate to wish you luck.

211
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,583
Only those who are fortunate will come
forward and cross your path.

212
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,417
You go, son.
You will pass this time.

213
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,458
Oh my, look at the way he looks.

214
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,750
If I see his face, I,
not only will write my exam bad

215
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,917
but I won’t even reach the exam Center.

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,708
Let's change the direction.

217
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,542
I knew it.

218
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,625
What's this?

219
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,250
I was feeling bad that no one
was coming forward to wish me luck,

220
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,042
and now you have crossed my path.

221
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,542
Oh, are you going
to write your exam?

222
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,458
Sorry, buddy.

223
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,417
Take this.

224
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,917
Ah, no. It’s a sentiment.
This one fell so don’t pick that one.

225
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,917
This is my lucky pen.

226
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,708
If you write your exams with this,
you will pass your exams.

227
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,458
You said, no one crossed
your path to wish you luck, right?

228
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,833
I will.

229
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,958
My father asks me to cross his path and
wish him luck every time he has some work.

230
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,917
I guarantee that whatever work you
do, you will be successful in it.

231
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,417
Come.

232
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,375
Today, you drank it so quickly.

233
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,792
You used to take an hour
to have beer.

234
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,458
My dad’s wish is almost fulfilled.

235
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,667
So...
drink another beer.

236
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,542
I quit drinking beer.

237
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,250
This is my last beer.

238
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,125
Why are you so shy?

239
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,458
I don’t know whether
she will agree or not.

240
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:41,000
She? Who is she?

241
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,042
She crossed my path today...

242
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:50,417
instead of going on my path.
And now, she is stuck in my heart.

243
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,667
Why are you thinking
about girls so much?

244
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,208
You are unaffected when
it comes to girls, right?

245
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,958
What?
I don’t know.

246
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,375
When I saw her beauty,
all my pride went away.

247
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,208
Does she look pretty?

248
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,917
It’s not about her beauty.

249
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,000
Her personality inspired me.
She has a good personality.

250
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,708
From today,
my family is not just the four of us.

251
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,125
With her included,
we are a family of five now.

252
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,667
This is how we do it.

253
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,875
Wow... what a pose.

254
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,583
Hey, your dad is with the board.

255
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,500
GUNA B.TECH.

256
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,250
Hit it, Dad.

257
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:36,875
Very good.

258
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,625
I'll fix the board now.

259
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,667
Uncle,
but the results are yet to come.

260
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,917
I will do it once my son
tells me to do it.

261
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,333
My son is gold.

262
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:49,875
He will pass for sure.

263
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,333
He is a brilliant student.
He will pass the exams.

264
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:55,125
Are you very confident that you will pass?
What? Why is sir so happy today?

265
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,125
Can’t you see the
confidence in my eyes?

266
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,542
Yes, I can see that.

267
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,875
If you are so confident,
then buy me a gift.

268
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,833
Is there any link to
your gift and his confidence?

269
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,000
Hey, go.

270
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:12,375
Dad, he doesn’t look like he’s going to
pass, so stop putting up the board.

271
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,208
If my son tells me,
I will do it.

272
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,500
So, Dad...

273
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,333
You want a gift, right?
I’ll buy you one.

274
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,750
I think there is something
wrong, dear.

275
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,583
If there is something wrong every
ten days or so, it doesn’t matter.

276
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,375
Also,
he’s passed his B.Tech exams.

277
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,375
Even if there is something off,
it's better to pretend like it's not.

278
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,875
Oh! What a royal look!

279
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,375
Yes... yes... he is drunk, right?
Now you will see the real royal look.

280
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,500
Hey, what happened to
the store that was here?

281
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,792
I brought you here
because it has changed.

282
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:44,833
Come on.

283
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,250
I have moved into the colony yesterday.
They are quite close to me.

284
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,708
They have to be close to
me, not her.

285
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,125
How are you?

286
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,625
-Hey, Sahiti. How are you?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

287
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,542
Have this sweet.

288
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,292
I have brought my brother and his friend.

289
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,333
-Take this sweet.
-I think that uncle has a sweet shop.

290
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,667
No, this is his shop.

291
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,583
We don’t eat carbs after
9 p.m. in the night, uncle.

292
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,125
We don’t eat them,
but we drink them, uncle.

293
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,417
A liquid diet is good, son.

294
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,458
That's even better.

295
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:10,500
Go ahead, dear.

296
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,583
Daughter, Sahiti has come.
Show her the cell phone.

297
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,208
-Okay, boys.
-Okay, uncle...

298
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,125
She is close to me.

299
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,708
Hey, my sister is a goddess.

300
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,292
Why because she asked
you to buy a cell phone?

301
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,542
You said you couldn’t see her then, right?
Now take a look.

302
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,792
It doesn’t matter if you hit me, but she
is beautiful like Goddess Lakshmi.

303
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:58,958
From today,
you cannot call her, sister.

304
00:21:59,042 --> 00:21:59,875
Why?

305
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,833
Because...

306
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:07,708
how can my
sister call the girl I love as "sister."

307
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,000
Okay?

308
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,292
-Okay, sister Geetha.
-Again, "sister?"

309
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,500
-Geetha, show me the cell phones.
-Give me a moment.

310
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:32,708
Let’s go.

311
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,125
Excuse me.
Can you give me a smile?

312
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,875
I want a selfie.

313
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,625
You can give me a smile, right?

314
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,750
My dear darling.

315
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,083
Stupid!

316
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:09,167
Son! How come you
are awake so early?

317
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,625
I think if I go on the bike,
then Geetha will fall for me.

318
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,583
Will Geetha fall for you?

319
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,875
I mean to say,
my fate will change.

320
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,708
Go, son. If your fate will
change then you have to go.

321
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:31,625
<i>You give life</i>
<i>To the imaginations of the heart</i>

322
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:35,583
<i>Like a dream</i>
<i>That you see early in the morning</i>

323
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,958
<i>My poor heart is drowning</i>
<i>In your intoxication</i>

324
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:47,042
<i>Do you know what is happening to me?</i>
<i>I am dreaming endlessly</i>

325
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:52,083
<i>Do I believe this to be</i>
<i>Some kind of sweet disturbance in me?</i>

326
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,375
<i>Is this our first meeting?</i>

327
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,750
<i>Is this my first taste of ecstasy?</i>

328
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:03,750
<i>My heart is asking me to reach out to you</i>
<i>Before I burn in this desire</i>

329
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:08,625
<i>Is this my first taste of ecstasy?</i>
<i>Is this our first meeting?</i>

330
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:14,208
<i>My heart is asking me to reach out to you</i>
<i>Before I burn in this desire</i>

331
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,375
<i>-My desires have increased...</i>
<i>-Is it so?</i>

332
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,875
<i>-And have now become my every breath</i>
<i>-Love!</i>

333
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:53,750
<i>Don’t look at me like that and</i>
<i>Cut my heart in pieces</i>

334
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:58,333
<i>Should I accompany you like the</i>
<i>Shadow that follows you around?</i>

335
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:03,500
<i>Should I make a promise</i>
<i>To never leave you and sign my name?</i>

336
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:08,375
<i>Even though you are in front of my eyes</i>
<i>You are tempting me with your smile...</i>

337
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:12,208
<i>Every step I take is towards you</i>

338
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,542
<i>Is this my first taste of ecstasy?</i>
<i>Is this our first meeting?</i>

339
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:24,625
<i>Before I burn in this desire</i>
<i>My heart is asking me to reach out to you</i>

340
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:29,375
<i>Is this my first taste of ecstasy?</i>
<i>Is this our first meeting?</i>

341
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:34,583
<i>Before I burn in this desire</i>
<i>My heart is asking me to reach out to you</i>

342
00:25:56,167 --> 00:26:01,000
<i>Even though I have hidden you in my heart</i>
<i>My love for you overflows</i>

343
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:05,958
<i>Why are you so close yet so far, my dear?</i>

344
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:10,708
<i>Like a cloud floating in the sky</i>
<i>Raining down on me</i>

345
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:15,750
<i>You walked into my life like an umbrella</i>
<i>Over my head, my dearest</i>

346
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:20,458
<i>I give you every bit of</i>
<i>Silently tormenting me</i>

347
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:25,083
<i>Even though you tempt me with your eyes me</i>

348
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:29,458
<i>Is this our first meeting?</i>

349
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,958
<i>Is this my first taste of ecstasy?</i>

350
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:36,833
<i>Before I burn in this desire</i>
<i>My heart is asking me to reach out to you</i>

351
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:39,083
<i>Is this our first meeting?</i>

352
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:41,750
<i>Is this my first taste of ecstasy?</i>

353
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:46,667
<i>Before I burn in this desire</i>
<i>My heart is asking me to reach out to you</i>

354
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,000
Hi, Guna. How are you?

355
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,500
I’m good, uncle. Tell me.

356
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,958
You were talking to me about
your sister’s marriage, right?

357
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:04,875
I brought you a nice
alliance for her.

358
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,750
I will send you the boy’s details.

359
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,125
Okay, uncle. Please do.

360
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,708
If you can send me your sister’s
photo and her details,

361
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:14,250
I will pass it on to them as well.

362
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,625
Don’t send my sister’s
photos now, uncle.

363
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,750
-Why?
-First. let us meet the boy

364
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,625
and decide if he is okay.

365
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,667
-Okay, uncle.
-Okay. Bye.

366
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,833
Mom!

367
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,667
Oh, you're here.

368
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,167
Come, Dad, sit down. Sit down.

369
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:50,792
What do you think of him?
I have got a match for my sister.

370
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,167
Hey, come here.

371
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,625
It’s your selection, right?

372
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,958
The boy is nice.

373
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,375
Ask him to come to meet us
for fixing up an alliance.

374
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,333
Wait, Mom.

375
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,208
How can you just look at a
photo and ask him to come home?

376
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,375
We have to send
our girl to a home

377
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,375
where they will look after
her even better than we can.

378
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,125
True.

379
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:09,958
-Greetings, uncle.
-Greetings!

380
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,250
Are you talking
about a match?

381
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,000
Nothing, we were just talking about an
alliance we got for my sister’s marriage.

382
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,333
Whoever that is, is dead.

383
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,083
What does he do?

384
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,708
We don't know much about him,
but here is his photo.

385
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:20,917
How is he?

386
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,042
Looks like I have seen
him somewhere before.

387
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:26,875
What’s his name?

388
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:30,208
-Sashi Kumar, I think.
-Sashi Kumar.

389
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,542
Are they from Narsingi?

390
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,125
He used to study well in those days
and you know how I studied anyway.

391
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:38,708
Really?
Does that mean he is a good guy?

392
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,625
I only know him from back then.

393
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,667
Anyway, you want his details, right?
Let’s go find out.

394
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,625
Apparently,
he owns a medical shop now.

395
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:46,625
Hey, wait. Don’t we have to
do this on an auspicious day?

396
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,875
We are not going there to
fix a date for the marriage.

397
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,125
We are just going
there to have a look.

398
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,042
Anything, related to my sister,
however small it may be,

399
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,000
we have to do it on an auspicious day.

400
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,083
Can I take him to the factory now or
should we wait for an auspicious day?

401
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,625
Let’s go!

402
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,625
-Namaste, brother. How are you?
-Hi, Sharat, what brings you here?

403
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,583
Nothing, brother. I wanted to discuss
a small land problem with you.

404
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:09,500
Tell me.

405
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,958
Two months ago, my friend
and I bought a plot together.

406
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,958
Since he had some issues,
I paid for his share as well.

407
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,750
Now the rates have skyrocketed.

408
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,083
He wants me to pay him
at the current rate.

409
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:21,833
If the rate had fallen, would
he have given it to you?

410
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,500
Call him here.
Let me talk to him.

411
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,333
Brother,
you will have to talk sternly,

412
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:27,125
as Radha is involved
in this matter.

413
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,250
Hey, stop those machines!

414
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,917
You said coming here
is a small problem.

415
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,250
But this is a big problem.

416
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:46,667
The plot is not more
important than your life.

417
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:51,708
Give it away.
Because Radha is on the other side.

418
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:56,750
If Radha is involved, then
it’s better we back down.

419
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,208
Go.

420
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:59,583
Hey, Sharat.

421
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,417
Since I said no,
you may go looking for political leaders

422
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,167
and other ways of help.

423
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:10,458
But it’s Radha. Radha makes all the
political leaders shake in fear.

424
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:18,375
This guy is your
follower, I believe.

425
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:21,583
Radha is involved in this.
He is involved

426
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,042
in this settlement after knowing about it.

427
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,375
Also,
he says he knows the MLA.

428
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:35,375
Once they hear Radha’s name,
how can they hear another name!

429
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:41,042
If I come to know that
you knowingly did this...

430
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:44,625
Sit down.

431
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:50,042
You got this post
because of peoples' votes.

432
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:54,583
I got this post because
of the people I stabbed.

433
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:58,250
This should not happen again.

434
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:01,125
Go...

435
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,250
Go and try to sell the plot.

436
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,125
Don’t lose it.

437
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,833
Don't lose your life!

438
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,750
Brother, is Radha so powerful?

439
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:15,625
Oh, yes. What did you think?
He’s very powerful.

440
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,750
But he’s close to me.

441
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,125
Really? Is it?

442
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,333
How would you know the
relationship I have with Radha?

443
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:20,583
You are a newcomer to this place.

444
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:21,500
Go do your work.

445
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,250
You are interested in everything
else but your work. Go!

446
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,125
I’m going. Your phone is ringing.

447
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,208
I’ll answer it.

448
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,542
Okay, sir. I’ll get it done.

449
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,708
Oh, no!

450
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,375
No, stop!

451
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,083
Oh, no. I broke my phone.
It's a new phone.

452
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,958
I need to take it to the cell phone shop
and get it repaired.

453
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,625
Oh my! What tactics!

454
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,875
You go and change your clothes.
I will get the bike.

455
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,708
Oh my, what tactics!

456
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,667
Why is this breaking
all the time?

457
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,042
I don’t understand it as well.

458
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:03,500
Is it happening only
now or did it happen even before this?

459
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:04,958
No,
it’s happening now.

460
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,458
Why is it happening now?

461
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:10,042
How would I know that?
You have to tell me that.

462
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:14,917
You need to tell me about it. I mean,
how will I know about cell phones?

463
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:19,500
That's my height.

464
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,833
Who asked you to grow so tall?

465
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:25,958
That’s why I grew so tall. That’s it.
Girls like tall people, right?

466
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,292
<i>Great achievement.</i>

467
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:30,292
How is the screen guard breaking
without anything happening to the phone?

468
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,000
If you break the screen guard it's just
a hundred rupees. What do you mean?

469
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,083
But if you break your phone, the cost
would

470
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,000
be more than two to three thousand rupees.

471
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,375
What do you mean by breaking it?

472
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,750
It's breaking on its own.

473
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,875
My friend can’t seem to articulate
it properly, that's why he said that.

474
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,875
Don’t pay attention to him.

475
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,542
By the way,
where did you break your phone?

476
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,125
In the factory.

477
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,833
If it broke there,
why bring it here?

478
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:52,292
There are many mobile
stores on the way here.

479
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,500
-She is asking you. Answer her.
-Let me think about it.

480
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,375
-Yes.
-You.

481
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,875
Okay. We have come to your shop.

482
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:05,250
If there are so many shops in the world...
why did we come to your shop?

483
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,292
Think about it.

484
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:10,292
Hello, Kamal Hassan.

485
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,250
I have a good reputation.
My name is Guna.

486
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,583
If I come to your shop,
others will come to your shop as well.

487
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,625
Then your shop will have a good business
and then you will be happy.

488
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,333
And if you are happy then I will also be
happy, right? That is what we want, right?

489
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,750
Hey! We don’t need an Oscar.
Let Kamal Hassan be.

490
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,208
Sit down.

491
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,875
I will be here.
I'm comfortable.

492
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,000
I have seen people talk
for hours on their phones.

493
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,542
But, for the first
time, I am seeing someone

494
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,000
who is using his phone
as an excuse to talk for hours.

495
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,583
He’s like a small child who cannot
even hold his phone properly. How sad.

496
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,292
Who? Is he like a child?

497
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:43,708
Why don’t you carry him then?

498
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,250
Do you know how to repair a cell phone?

499
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,250
Yes, I do.

500
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:53,083
Ah, these days even my phone
is not working well. Have a look at it.

501
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,208
Wait.

502
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,333
We can’t repair your phone.

503
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,750
Why? Why can’t you do it?

504
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,208
We didn’t like your cell phone
so, we will not repair it.

505
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,417
How can you not
like my cell phone?

506
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,333
Yes. We didn’t like
your cell phone.

507
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,833
Hence, we won’t.
We will only repair it, if we like it.

508
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:11,125
Brother,
did you listen to her?

509
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,958
She's like a cart’s wheel.
She's making noise.

510
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,042
Call her a cart’s wheel
or a mortar.

511
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,083
Don’t disturb me.
I am feeling love right now.

512
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,042
Right?

513
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,833
Oh my, his tactics!

514
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,125
Look at what he’s up to.

515
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:26,708
And you call him a small child, who
cannot even hold his cell phone properly?

516
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:28,750
Can’t see all this drama.

517
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,417
Hey, what are you doing?

518
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,792
I will leave soon.

519
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:03,958
I never thought I would close the shutter
like this and forcibly talk to a girl.

520
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:05,958
Geetha, please listen to me...

521
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,250
When you see a girl, you
may be attracted to her.

522
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,708
When the attraction increases,
then love starts to grow.

523
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,542
If this love has to
remain life long,

524
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,167
then I need to open up
and tell her how I feel, right?

525
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:20,167
I don’t even know how to propose.

526
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:24,125
Because of that, all these days,
I have been roaming around you like this.

527
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,875
But somehow I feel, you look at me like
just another person who is after you.

528
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,167
I am not ordinary.

529
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,583
I want to marry you.

530
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,500
And then have kids.

531
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:42,792
When they grow old enough to fall in
love, then you tell them that...

532
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:47,917
that is why I fell in love with
your father and he loved me a lot.

533
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:50,917
And then they will say...

534
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:54,500
we can see that he loves you.
Doesn’t he love you the same way even now?

535
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:55,958
Trust me.

536
00:35:56,208 --> 00:36:00,583
I will love you all my life.
I will always care for you.

537
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,250
My love for you has given me the strength
to talk to you like this.

538
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,458
You don’t have to talk to me.

539
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,125
Just talk to yourself about it.

540
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:14,667
Ask yourself, why haven’t you stopped
a guy from talking to you like this,

541
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,458
while you look into his eyes.

542
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,458
Ask yourself.

543
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,375
Ask yourself, okay?

544
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,167
You will ask yourself.

545
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,333
-Really, bro. She is super.
-Yes.

546
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,083
Even though she’s mad,
she looks very hot.

547
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,583
Yes, she looks very hot.

548
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,542
-Hey, look there.
-What curves!

549
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:22,792
Look. Look.

550
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,208
Ah, Dad, stop the bike.

551
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,167
What happened, Geetha?

552
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:27,417
Just a minute, Dad.

553
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:30,833
Do you have any sense?

554
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,417
-Hey, let’s go.
-Come.

555
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,292
-What is it, dear?
-Just a minute, Dad.

556
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:43,042
Hey, here. Take this.

557
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:44,667
Take it!

558
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,083
Wait.

559
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,625
Hey, don’t remove it.
What are you doing?

560
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:55,208
What is this, dear?

561
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:58,083
You are also
mad like that girl.

562
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:02,042
Geetha, you have done enough.
Come.

563
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,417
Wait, Dad.

564
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:04,583
Okay.

565
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,750
Hey, what are you doing?

566
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,167
Hello, he’s my son!

567
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,625
Such a nice boy.

568
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,542
I'm proud of you.

569
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:25,708
Geetha, dear, let’s go?

570
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:28,167
Oh no, the whole town is looking at him
and are casting their evil eye on him.

571
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,083
Hey, what is this?

572
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,333
Why are you taking off your shirt?

573
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,375
-Hey, come here!
-See you.

574
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,458
Coming, Mom.

575
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,583
Come!

576
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,750
Evil eye? On him?

577
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:38,167
-Here, wear this.
-My son is a gem of a guy!

578
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,292
Hey, Alia Bhatta!

579
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,208
Pick the leaves
and give them to me.

580
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,083
Bhatta! Why are you calling me Bhatta?

581
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,917
Bhatta?
So, what if it's Bhatta or Butt.

582
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:00,458
First, pick up those leaves.
Come here...

583
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:03,417
-Hey, stop. Stop.
-Old woman.

584
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,375
Because he stopped me you are
saved, otherwise...

585
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,917
Here, eat your leaves.

586
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,333
You just missed
a gory bloodbath.

587
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:15,125
Come on now.
I have some urgent work to do.

588
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,083
Yes, we will see.

589
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,917
-Watch out.
-I’ll be there in five minutes.

590
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,375
Okay, sir. I will be in
touch with you over the phone.

591
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,583
Damn!

592
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,667
Is this your urgent work?

593
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:27,042
No, this time it fell for real.

594
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:34,250
You won’t bother about my cell phone, but
you take such good care of his cell phone.

595
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,792
-I have to get my phone repaired.
-Let’s go.

596
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,833
Generally, the cell phone signal
comes from the cell phone tower.

597
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,458
But, look at how
the cell phone tower

598
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,792
has come to the cell phone shop
to get the signal.

599
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:55,708
Yes.

600
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:57,458
He keeps coming again and again.

601
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,417
This time it broke for real.

602
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,667
<i>Have you fallen for me?</i>

603
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,083
<i>I love you.</i>

604
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,458
<i>Why?</i>

605
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,958
<i>Because you saw me put a shirt</i>
<i>on, on that mad girl yesterday?</i>

606
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:50,292
<i>Girls, don’t just fall for guys who</i>
<i>help mad people or give food to orphans.</i>

607
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:55,708
<i>That is why I fell for you.</i>
<i>I like the way you are.</i>

608
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,042
<i>Will you look after me,</i>
<i>just like he said you would?</i>

609
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:08,875
<i>Who? Our son?</i>

610
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:13,500
<i>Ah! My sweet darling!</i>

611
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:25,000
<i>It’s hard to believe that</i>
<i>This is not a dream</i>

612
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,917
<i>You have changed the whole story, my girl</i>

613
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:33,125
<i>I will always hold your hand and not let</i>
<i>go</i>

614
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:36,792
<i>You have made it so, my man</i>

615
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:41,750
<i>I can’t believe, so I have to pinch myself</i>
<i>To know this is real</i>

616
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:45,792
<i>The pain I feel is making</i>
<i>My heart burst with joy</i>

617
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:53,792
<i>My stomach hurts, laughing so much</i>
<i>At the way you are jumping about in joy</i>

618
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:57,583
<i>Now you have to get used to this</i>
<i>My darling</i>

619
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:03,458
<i>My sweet darling</i>
<i>Your beauty is sweet and spicy</i>

620
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:07,583
<i>My darling</i>
<i>My sweet darling</i>

621
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:11,750
<i>Your antics are making me even more shy</i>

622
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:31,458
<i>I can see new paths form,</i>
<i>In my hometown right in front of my eyes</i>

623
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:35,333
<i>That is how it is</i>
<i>That is how it is when you are a couple</i>

624
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:39,708
<i>I can’t remember the days</i>
<i>I spent with my loved ones anymore</i>

625
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:44,208
<i>When you fall in love,</i>
<i>This is the magic it creates</i>

626
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:46,292
<i>I have to give you</i>
<i>So many kisses</i>

627
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,333
<i>I have to send these kisses through the</i>
<i>air</i>

628
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,125
<i>Till I have breath left in me</i>

629
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:59,833
<i>I am right in front of you</i>
<i>Why do you tease me like this?</i>

630
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:03,542
<i>Now you have to get used to this</i>
<i>My darling</i>

631
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,583
<i>My sweet darling</i>

632
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:09,542
<i>If your antics get out of hand</i>
<i>They will become a crime</i>

633
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:13,500
<i>My sweet darling</i>

634
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:17,500
<i>Don’t keep me away from your beauty</i>

635
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:53,500
<i>The moment I touched you</i>
<i>I feel like luck is finally on my side</i>

636
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:57,542
<i>Enough of this</i>
<i>Reduce your praise</i>

637
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:01,833
<i>I am giving you this life and my next</i>
<i>life, It's up to you now</i>

638
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:06,250
<i>See, how the madness is increasing in you</i>

639
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:08,083
<i>Many have said these words</i>

640
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:10,125
<i>I have heard all these words before</i>

641
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:14,042
<i>There are so many wonders in empty words</i>

642
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,083
<i>Okay, we have said these words before</i>

643
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,250
<i>You have heard them everywhere</i>

644
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,833
<i>I will show you in action, anyway</i>

645
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:27,583
<i>Now I have to get used to this, my darling</i>
<i>My sweet darling</i>

646
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:31,583
<i>All your antics, I will like them on</i>
<i>Friday</i>

647
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:35,458
<i>My darling</i>
<i>My sweet darling</i>

648
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:39,708
<i>Your beauty is making a garland of flowers</i>

649
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:48,417
Here's the shop... stop.

650
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,625
-Tell me, sir. What do you want?
-I want a bottle of alcohol.

651
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,375
The liquor store is there.

652
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:55,542
-This is a medical shop.
-Really?

653
00:45:55,917 --> 00:45:58,167
I need some water
for my alcohol.

654
00:45:58,417 --> 00:45:59,375
Give me some.

655
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:02,000
Hey, what is this?

656
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:12,417
Hey, Sashi.
Give me some water at room temperature.

657
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,417
Are you Battu?

658
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,375
Why will you recognize
people like me?

659
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:20,458
It’s been so long. Sorry, bro.

660
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:21,917
He’s my friend, Guna.

661
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:24,375
-Please sit down.
-Come... let's sit and talk.

662
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:25,750
Sit down.

663
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:30,667
-How is the shop running?
-There you go.

664
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,292
There is no problem.
It’s quite peaceful.

665
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,500
What do you do, by the way?

666
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,083
We break stones in
a granite factory.

667
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,708
-Where do you live?
-In Ongole.

668
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:40,917
I keep coming to Ongole.

669
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,792
Call me when you are in town next.
We’ll meet.

670
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:44,958
How come you opened such
a small medical shop?

671
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:47,625
You studied well back in the day
and said you had to get a good job.

672
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:49,458
Sometimes things do not
work out the way we plan.

673
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:50,667
This is life.

674
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,917
I understood that my parents couldn’t
afford to give me a higher education.

675
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:55,417
That’s why I started this shop.

676
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,458
My parents are happy.
I am even happier.

677
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,750
Excuse me, I’ll be right back.

678
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,292
Tell me.

679
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,042
Hey, what work do you have with his phone?

680
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,042
Wait a minute.

681
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:12,458
That's the passcode.

682
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,875
Hey, do you have any sense?
Why are you using the phone?

683
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,750
Boss, we will leave now.

684
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:25,667
Hey, wait. I’ll be right there.

685
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,833
-Just two minutes.
-Hey, no problem.

686
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:28,833
We will meet. Let us know
the next time you are in Ongole.

687
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,500
Don’t forget to call me.

688
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:34,583
He seems like a nice boy.
He's sweet.

689
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:35,917
Yes. He’s a nice guy.

690
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,875
But our sister has earned a B.Tech.

691
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,750
Looking at his medical shop,
I don’t think he makes enough money.

692
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,917
You have to think about that as
well, right?

693
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:45,667
I don’t know about all that.

694
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,292
But I know he’s a
responsible person.

695
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,292
I am sure he will take
care of my sister very well.

696
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,500
What about his education?

697
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:54,167
If you work hard enough to eat and
a place to stay, that's enough.

698
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,375
They will be happy.
What else do you need?

699
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,958
Hey, if you are happy.
I am doubly happy for you.

700
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,000
Wait. Let me go and talk to
him, right away.

701
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,125
Hey, wait.
Let me have a word at home.

702
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:05,167
Yes, tell me.

703
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:10,417
Tell him I told him, so.

704
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:12,042
Okay.

705
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:18,250
Hey! Have you lost your sight?

706
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:26,375
Sorry, brother.

707
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:31,083
No. You said something, right?
Say that again?

708
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:35,167
If I was going on the wrong route,
I would have hit you as well.

709
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,250
So...

710
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,750
So, you mean to say that
I made a mistake?

711
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,333
I made a mistake?

712
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,625
You said, "Have you lost
your sight" or something.

713
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:52,875
No, brother. I did not say that.

714
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:53,958
Yes, it is nice.

715
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:56,083
No, you said something.

716
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,208
-What is that?
-I will do not it again, brother.

717
00:48:58,292 --> 00:48:59,792
-Wait, I’ll just come.
-Please, brother.

718
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,792
How dare you tell me if
I have lost my sight!

719
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:04,792
Hey! What are you doing?
Do you understand?

720
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:07,667
Who are you?

721
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,792
Hey, what's this?

722
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:14,542
He’s my friend, brother.
Brother, they are my family.

723
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,625
Please let them go.

724
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:18,458
Please let them go.

725
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:21,667
The dangers of the world can
come in any shape and form, Guna.

726
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,542
If you want our people to be
safe, you need to tell them.

727
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:33,083
I am letting them go.
I know you from childhood...

728
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:43,125
What were you doing?
Hey, do you have any sense?

729
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:45,375
What about you?
Do you know who he is?

730
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:46,750
He would have killed you.

731
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:48,250
Why do you have to interfere?

732
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:51,417
My heart stopped for a moment.

733
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:57,667
Battu is your friend, right?

734
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,458
If he’s your friend,
then he is like a brother to me.

735
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:02,542
If anyone lays a hand on him
then how can I keep calm?

736
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,500
<i>Tell me you are sorry.</i>

737
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,125
Hey, go.

738
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:21,708
<i>Tell me.</i>

739
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:27,708
<i>Hey, you.</i>

740
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,750
<i>I will break up with you.</i>

741
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:32,292
Hey, Go away.

742
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,500
Why am I getting so many
Facebook requests these days?

743
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,458
Oh! It’s her birthday!

744
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,625
Happy Birthday, darling!

745
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,417
Thank you, dear.

746
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,542
Only wishes?

747
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,917
Do you want a cake?

748
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,792
Don’t act smart?

749
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:18,417
Hey, I am talking
about cutting a cake.

750
00:51:18,917 --> 00:51:19,875
Really?

751
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,625
What do you want then, darling?

752
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,292
Will you give me
whatever I want?

753
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,417
I will give you
whatever you want.

754
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:31,000
I want a nice gift.

755
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:33,792
Okay.

756
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:36,458
I don’t want an ordinary gift.

757
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:37,375
Then?

758
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:40,667
It has to touch my heart.

759
00:51:41,042 --> 00:51:44,667
Oh, it has to touch your
heart.

760
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,625
-Where is the gift?
-Here’s your gift.

761
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:57,292
What is it?

762
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:00,333
Open and see for yourself.
It's an extraordinary gift.

763
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,042
Why did you slap me?

764
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,667
What is this?

765
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,083
You asked for something
that will touch your heart,

766
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:17,042
so, I brought you something
that will touch your heart.

767
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,250
You are so stupid.

768
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,250
You are fit to be in a museum.

769
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,417
What a laugh?

770
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,917
You...

771
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,417
-Hey... that's right.
-Shut up.

772
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,833
You say...

773
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:35,083
-I'll kill you.
-Hey... what happened.

774
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:39,042
Hey, this is for you only...

775
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,167
I’ll go and get a water bottle.

776
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:04,000
Oh my! Why is my body getting hot?
Be cool.

777
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,292
Hey, dude.
Her profile is fantastic!

778
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,208
What do you mean?

779
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:19,667
Her front and back profile.

780
00:53:20,417 --> 00:53:23,375
I don’t know who's her boyfriend
but he’s very lucky.

781
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:24,292
Yes.

782
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,875
He’s not just lucky.

783
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:28,542
He’s very lucky. She is so hot!

784
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,625
How come we never come
across people like her?

785
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,000
Why will we get such women?

786
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,833
She looks like a nicely roasted
corn on the cob with spices.

787
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,333
Hey! What is this?

788
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:40,583
Enough of this nonsense!

789
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:44,625
Hey, you.
What do you think of yourself?

790
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,417
Hey, let me teach you a lesson.

791
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,083
Hey, I'll break your bones.

792
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,250
Come here. Come here!
Hey, where are you running off?

793
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:55,208
Hey, you... I’ll kill you.

794
00:53:55,292 --> 00:53:59,333
What do you mean shameful?
Black as a crow!

795
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:01,292
Hey! I will kill you guys!

796
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:04,583
Why are you running away?
If you have the courage, come face me.

797
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:05,833
Hey, please run away.

798
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:08,750
-Leave me!
-Run. Let's go.

799
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:11,500
What happened?
Why are you hitting them like that?

800
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,250
Maybe we can stop the tide from flowing
but not a woman’s anger.

801
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,833
What did they say, by the way?

802
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,542
Well...

803
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:27,292
They spoke badly about me.

804
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,750
You got angry for this?

805
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,500
They gave you a compliment.

806
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:31,458
Is this a compliment?

807
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:34,875
They said your boyfriend
was lucky to have you.

808
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,833
I am lucky, right?

809
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,333
They said you look sexy.

810
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:44,500
You are not just sexy,
you are more than that, my sweet darling.

811
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:45,958
Won’t they give a compliment, then?

812
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:50,875
My darling. They said you look superhot.
You are hot.

813
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,458
Why should you have all
this anger towards them?

814
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:53,625
Lose your anger now.

815
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,708
It is nice when you
say these things to me.

816
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,458
Maintain this feeling,
I will take you away from here. Okay?

817
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:01,958
Let’s go.

818
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,625
Why are we here?

819
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,458
You said you wanted a gift, right?
Let’s go.

820
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,167
I simply said that.
No.

821
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,417
Not simply. I decided to give you a
gift, so let’s go.

822
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:27,833
It will suit you perfectly.
Take it.

823
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,125
-I like this one.
-Which one?

824
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,125
-What’s so nice about it?
-I’ll take this one.

825
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,667
This one will suit you.
That is not nice at all. This is nice.

826
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,792
Excuse me, isn't this nice for her?

827
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,083
Yes, it is nice.

828
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,125
Take this one. This is nice.
Don’t worry about the cost.

829
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,833
I will take this one.
No. I liked this one.

830
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:43,750
Okay, give it to her.

831
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,417
What did I say now? Take it.

832
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:52,833
Guna, since my childhood I
believe that my selection is good.

833
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:54,208
Okay.

834
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,750
I love my dad.

835
00:55:57,292 --> 00:56:00,667
But if he says he’ll bring me, someone,
who is better than you, will I accept it?

836
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,958
Till now, my family has been
the best thing in my life.

837
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,375
From now on, it's you too.

838
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So, what now...
that ring, right?

839
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:16,208
Okay, pack that ring.

840
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:27,708
<i>My dear, you are the breath I take</i>

841
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:33,083
<i>I have been born just to love you</i>

842
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,125
<i>I can spend a hundred years</i>
<i>In the garden of flowers</i>

843
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:50,542
<i>My dear, this life of mine is yours</i>

844
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:58,167
<i>With you, I am part of you</i>
<i>I am always following you</i>

845
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:05,625
<i>This is the truth, the only truth</i>
<i>We both are one</i>

846
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:13,542
<i>Even God blesses our union</i>
<i>In this auspicious time</i>

847
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:23,292
<i>In this second,</i>
<i>both halves of our bodies become one</i>

848
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:31,333
<i>The sweet taste of your lips is divine</i>

849
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,292
No one should say anything about it.
Take care of the merchandise.

850
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,500
Okay, brother.

851
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:48,542
Namaste, brother.

852
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:54,667
Hey, waiter.
Send them to another table.

853
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,208
Clean it up.

854
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,333
Clean it fast.

855
00:57:58,417 --> 00:57:59,875
Two minutes, brother.

856
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,875
Hey, clean it fast.

857
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,000
Hey, it’s Radha.

858
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,625
Gaddala Gunta Radha.

859
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:09,875
He looks good,
just like his name.

860
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:27,917
Where is the beer, brother?

861
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:31,500
Hey, how long will he
take with our order?

862
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,250
Look at him, they
served him so quick.

863
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,958
No one cares about us.

864
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:43,333
Hey, where is our order?

865
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,833
Brother!

866
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,208
Hey,
I did not hit you on purpose.

867
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:52,833
Really?

868
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,208
Hey, you!

869
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:12,250
Who the hell are you?
How dare you come here!

870
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:15,917
How dare you hit Gaddala Gunta Radha!
Hey, you idiots!

871
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,958
Oh no, what have they done!

872
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:19,125
-Now we are dead.
-We hit him without knowing who he is.

873
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,625
Catch them!

874
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:24,708
Run! Run! Hurry!

875
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,375
Wait!

876
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:36,083
We didn’t know he was Radha
and we hit him. Let’s go!

877
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,792
Bow down your head.

878
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:43,667
I am going to behead
the ones who touched me.

879
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:48,417
I want them! Only then I will
lift your heads up again!

880
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:53,042
Hey! Where are those idiots?

881
00:59:57,542 --> 00:59:59,333
RESTAURANT AND BAR.

882
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,500
Now, what do we do, bro?

883
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,708
What can we do now?

884
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,833
Why did you fight with Radha
of all the people?

885
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:45,833
Fighting with Radha is like picking
up sticks for our own funeral pyre.

886
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,250
Brother,
please you have to help me.

887
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,417
I only have you guys.

888
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,333
He was about to hit me with a bottle,
because he was about to dash into me

889
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:55,333
when he was coming from the
wrong side of the road.

890
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:58,167
Otherwise, I would have been dead by now.

891
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,042
Guna came and rescued me at the right
time.

892
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:03,208
So please ask him to help me as well.

893
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,125
You told me that your friend
knows him very well.

894
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,458
Boss, please.

895
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:10,625
I generally don’t
get into fights.

896
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,542
I was trying to save my friend and
now I am caught in the middle of it all.

897
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,208
That time, because he knew me
from childhood, he let him go.

898
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,333
Also, he stays right next to
us, in the next lane.

899
01:01:21,542 --> 01:01:24,833
If something goes wrong,
he will create a scene at my house.

900
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:27,333
Sorry, boss. Please understand.

901
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:29,250
Please convince him.

902
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,625
If something happens to me,
my entire family will be on the road.

903
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:35,083
My father is not well.
My family needs me.

904
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,375
Please...

905
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:39,000
Please, boss.

906
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,167
Please help me one time.

907
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,042
If you help me one time,
you will be saving my entire family.

908
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,000
Why are you insisting so much?

909
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:48,583
I came to you that day
regarding something.

910
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:51,208
But today you are making
me rethink everything.

911
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,417
Also, you say that if something happens
to you, then your family will be homeless.

912
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,625
So, even though I
have a small doubt

913
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,625
that something may
happen to my family.

914
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:02,125
I am risking it for you.

915
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:03,458
I am doing it only for your family.

916
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,208
I’ll go to Radha
and talk to him.

917
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:09,000
If he agrees, it's fine.

918
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,000
If he doesn’t,
then I can’t do anything.

919
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:12,583
You guys figure it out.
I am not responsible.

920
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:16,917
-Please try to convince Radha.
-Hey, Guna.

921
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Do we need this?

922
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:21,833
It’s okay.
It's about his family.

923
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,375
What is it, Guna?

924
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,708
I want to talk to brother.

925
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,000
There is a small issue, brother.

926
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:38,333
Is there a problem?

927
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:40,042
No, nothing like that.

928
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,292
It’s about the small fight that happened
in the restaurant the other day...

929
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:52,958
and the guy who pushed
you is someone I know.

930
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:03,583
Tell me.

931
01:03:04,292 --> 01:03:06,000
What should I let go?

932
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:12,208
His life? Or my respect?

933
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,792
No, brother.
You should not let him go.

934
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,833
You should kill him.

935
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,667
That is what is
going to happen now.

936
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:18,542
But, brother...

937
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:19,458
What is it?

938
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:21,833
When there is a poster of the Prime
Minister on the wall,

939
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:24,750
a passing cow can chew it
and spit it out.

940
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:28,333
But that doesn’t mean the
cow has no respect for him.

941
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:30,750
It only did so because it
had no knowledge of him.

942
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:32,000
These guys are also the same.

943
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,333
Had they known it was Radha,
they would not even have sat down,

944
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:38,375
let alone laying a hand on you.

945
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,917
Brother, if they lay a hand on
you without knowing it was you,

946
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,458
then how is it laying a hand on you?

947
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:46,708
Brother, you are Radha.

948
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,583
You want to catch
them and kill them.

949
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:55,542
What do we do now?

950
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:59,667
I will bring him here and he will
fall on your feet and apologize.

951
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:06,292
You will make him apologize.

952
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:07,625
Yes, brother.

953
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,333
Ask him to come here.

954
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:18,792
Here?

955
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:20,708
Okay. Not here.

956
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:25,208
I will come there.
You decide a place and let me know.

957
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:26,583
Thanks, brother.

958
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,333
Tell me.

959
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:31,417
Everything is fine.

960
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:33,208
-Radha has agreed to compromise.
-Really?

961
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:34,750
He also asked me to
decide on a place to meet.

962
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,042
Ask Sasi to be ready tomorrow.

963
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,000
I will take him there.

964
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,958
How can you compromise with
the guy who touched you?

965
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:43,458
Compromise with Radha.
Let him come here.

966
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,792
Where are you off to?

967
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,333
I am going to meet a friend.
I will be back in an hour.

968
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:55,917
Go.

969
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:01,500
Hey, why are you following me?

970
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:03,083
To see you.

971
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:05,083
Where are you going?

972
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:07,500
I have some work.
I should be back in an hour.

973
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:09,375
Yes. I am sure. Sure?

974
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:34,500
You said you had some work, right?
Go and come.

975
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,083
I have to go
out in twenty minutes.

976
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:40,750
Brother will be here in two minutes.
Why are you so tensed, boss?

977
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:43,292
I spoke to him. You just
have to say sorry and we are done.

978
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:44,250
Okay, boss.

979
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:19,500
Brother, I told you...

980
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,625
Thank you for coming.

981
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:25,500
Come.

982
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,958
He’s a good guy, brother.

983
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:33,917
Hey, say sorry.

984
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,208
He will tell you sorry, brother.

985
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:37,083
Hey, say sorry.

986
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:49,125
Why are you hitting
him, brother?

987
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:52,250
Brother, please leave him.

988
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,417
He is asking for apologies...
Leave him, brother.

989
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,792
Hey, move.

990
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,625
Sorry, brother.
I have made a mistake, please forgive me.

991
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:02,042
Please forgive me. I am sorry.

992
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:10,083
Brother, please leave him!

993
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,667
Please don’t hit him, brother.

994
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:19,292
How can you get away by saying sorry
after laying a hand on Radha!

995
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:27,500
Leave him, brother. Brother, please!
He says he is sorry.

996
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:30,917
You said you will let him go.
What is this?

997
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,125
Brother, please! Leave him!

998
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:38,250
Please let him go.

999
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:41,875
He didn’t know it was
you, brother.

1000
01:07:45,792 --> 01:07:49,375
Thanks, brother.
Please! Leave him!

1001
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,000
Fall at his feet.
Fall at his feet.

1002
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,625
Fall at his feet.

1003
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:56,458
I am sorry, brother.
I didn’t know it was you.

1004
01:07:56,542 --> 01:08:00,417
-Please forgive me, brother.
-He didn’t know it was you, brother.

1005
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:13,083
Do you know who you are laying a hand on?
Hey! Do you have any sense?

1006
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:14,000
I know.

1007
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:16,208
I am going to kill him!
I have come to kill him.

1008
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,125
What will you do?

1009
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:19,708
If anything happens,
I am going to die! What do you mean?

1010
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:23,417
Then die. Come! Come!
Then die. Come!

1011
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:29,125
I’ll kill you too! Come.
You can also die with him. Come.

1012
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:36,250
Brother, I am not responsible for this.

1013
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:37,625
You know me since I was young.

1014
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,250
I am not that type of guy.
Please let me go, brother.

1015
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,208
I am not related to this.
Brother!

1016
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:02,417
Hey! What are you guys doing?

1017
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:31,333
Don’t leave him. Kill him.

1018
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:48,833
Don’t let him go.
Come here! Catch him.

1019
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:50,292
Don’t let him go. Kill him.

1020
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,875
Hey, come here.

1021
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,000
Come.

1022
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,667
Hey, Mastan. Come here.

1023
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,208
Hey! That’s it!

1024
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:36,375
Hey, no. Hey, no.
Hey, no, please.

1025
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:39,375
No. Hey, no.
Hey, no, please. No.

1026
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:42,333
Please don’t kill that trust.
I brought him here on trust.

1027
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:44,958
Hey, no, please. No.

1028
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,208
Hey, wait...

1029
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:27,458
Tell me.

1030
01:12:40,417 --> 01:12:41,500
Dear...

1031
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,667
Dear...

1032
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:09,875
<i>According to the primary</i>
<i>investigative report of the police,</i>

1033
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:13,000
<i>and after listening to all</i>
<i>the victim testimonies...</i>

1034
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:16,250
<i>they have concluded that Guna</i>
<i>is the primary suspect,</i>

1035
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:19,500
<i>in the murder case of</i>
<i>Gaddala Gunta Radha...</i>

1036
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,250
<i>and that the accused is to</i>
<i>be sent in for remand.</i>

1037
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:26,500
<i>The police have been ordered to</i>
<i>further investigate the case,</i>

1038
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:30,792
<i>and catch the remaining</i>
<i>suspects as soon as possible.</i>

1039
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:32,750
Go on now.

1040
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,042
Come forward now.

1041
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:35,083
Go now.

1042
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:36,250
Go.

1043
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,500
How many people?

1044
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:38,667
Three of us.

1045
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,708
Three?
Have you come for a marriage?

1046
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,833
Can’t you understand?
Only two can go.

1047
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:47,042
Uncle, you go.

1048
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,292
Come on, now move.

1049
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,625
What is the name of the accused?

1050
01:14:05,792 --> 01:14:06,625
Dad.

1051
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:07,792
Dad.

1052
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:14,417
Sorry, Dad.

1053
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:20,000
You were there to do some good.
Who knew this would happen?

1054
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:24,083
Son. Son? Don’t worry.

1055
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:26,875
Sister?

1056
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:28,667
She said she wanted to come.

1057
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,208
But I didn’t want to
bring her to such a place.

1058
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,708
Okay, Dad.

1059
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,042
You also do not come.

1060
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:45,292
You should never come
to such a place. Ever!

1061
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,250
Please, Dad.

1062
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,083
-Guna!
-Do not come here ever.

1063
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:50,708
I will come home.

1064
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:52,417
It's not like that, son.

1065
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,125
Till I come home,
you don’t come here.

1066
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:55,083
-Guna...
-Guna...

1067
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:56,125
It's time to leave.

1068
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,083
Let's move.

1069
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:59,708
Let's move. It's time to leave.

1070
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,167
Move...

1071
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:16,250
<i>This is venom for heart</i>

1072
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,500
<i>It feels like a death</i>
<i>For every second</i>

1073
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,750
<i>If I cannot see you in front of me</i>
<i>My life becomes disturbed</i>

1074
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:30,042
<i>This is the devastation for desires</i>

1075
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:33,375
<i>My heart is crushed in them</i>

1076
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:39,417
<i>Even if life becomes heavy,</i>
<i>The bittern pain will be shared by us</i>

1077
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:43,542
<i>The restlessness is making me sad</i>

1078
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:47,000
<i>The sky has fallen on me</i>
<i>Like a bolt of lightning</i>

1079
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:53,125
<i>I’m unable to control my beating heart</i>
<i>and has overwhelmed me like a deluge</i>

1080
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,417
<i>Without you,</i>
<i>There are always tears in my eyes</i>

1081
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,958
<i>Knowing I cannot be with you,</i>
<i>My heart is roaring like ocean waves</i>

1082
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:03,667
<i>The darkness never ends</i>
<i>I don't know where you are?</i>

1083
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,833
<i>How do I meet you?</i>

1084
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:13,542
<i>Even when I sigh, I feel your breath</i>
<i>Even in my sadness, I think of you</i>

1085
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:17,167
<i>I don’t know how I can free myself</i>
<i>From this trap</i>

1086
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,375
<i>Surround on all four sides</i>
<i>Why is it like this?</i>

1087
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:53,917
<i>Pain in me has been expressed</i>
<i>In my sleepless eyes</i>

1088
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,542
<i>Like yesterday and day before,</i>
<i>I am not with you today</i>

1089
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:07,542
<i>We were together in happy times</i>
<i>We are still together in troubled times</i>

1090
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:14,542
<i>Sadly, our love has been sacrificed to</i>
<i>fate</i>

1091
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:18,167
<i>Having faltered in the first chapter</i>
<i>itself</i>

1092
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:21,625
<i>The story of our love is weeping</i>

1093
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:27,667
<i>Not knowing how it will end</i>
<i>It is moving forward</i>

1094
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:31,167
<i>Without you,</i>
<i>There are always tears in my eyes</i>

1095
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:34,750
<i>My heart is roaring like ocean waves</i>
<i>Knowing I cannot be with you</i>

1096
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:38,167
<i>Don't know where you are?</i>
<i>The darkness never ends</i>

1097
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,417
<i>How do I meet you?</i>

1098
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,833
<i>Even in my sadness</i>
<i>I think of you</i>

1099
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:48,333
<i>Even when I sigh</i>
<i>I feel your breath</i>

1100
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:51,833
<i>I don’t know how I can free myself</i>
<i>From this trap</i>

1101
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:55,708
<i>Why is it like this?</i>

1102
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,292
-Brother?
-I'll meet to you soon.

1103
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:51,042
Is he back from jail?

1104
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,625
Uncle, how are you?

1105
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:53,542
I’m fine.

1106
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:55,792
I will meet you again.
I'm just going out for some work.

1107
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,833
See you.

1108
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,417
Hey. Hey, bro...

1109
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,125
I went to see you at the jail.

1110
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,667
But they told me you had left.
Come, get on the bike. Let’s go.

1111
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,083
No.

1112
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,083
No.

1113
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,542
I could lift my head high
and walk around in this colony before.

1114
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:30,250
Today,
I have to hang my head low.

1115
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:33,750
If you are next to me,
you will also have to do the same.

1116
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,708
I am your friend.
Get on the bike.

1117
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:39,542
I am telling you
because you are my friend.

1118
01:20:40,792 --> 01:20:45,792
I should have listened to you
when you asked me not to get involved.

1119
01:20:46,042 --> 01:20:50,167
As a friend, you are right
for wanting to be by my side.

1120
01:20:50,917 --> 01:20:55,125
But having you around me is
not the right thing to do.

1121
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:56,417
Nothing will happen.

1122
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,583
When everything settles
down, I will call you.

1123
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,083
Hey, what happened?
Why are you like that?

1124
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,000
What happened to you?

1125
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:36,500
Oh, about that.

1126
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:41,083
This is such a small issue. I had
work in the factory. I messaged you.

1127
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,458
Don’t take me so lightly.

1128
01:21:44,292 --> 01:21:46,625
When I was very young,
even before I could remember,

1129
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,833
I believe I would cry if my mother
was not with me even for a second.

1130
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:54,583
Now, if you are not around,
I feel like crying.

1131
01:21:58,042 --> 01:21:59,750
I will not leave you again
even for a day.

1132
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:05,042
Smile.

1133
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:10,333
Okay. Shall we go out tomorrow?

1134
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:21,125
I will never leave you again.

1135
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:33,958
What is it, dear?

1136
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:39,417
I wanted to meet Geetha...

1137
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,417
I know, Guna.

1138
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,125
My daughter talks about you.

1139
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,208
She told me that
you are a good guy.

1140
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:47,708
And that you don’t like getting
into fights at all.

1141
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:50,125
She says, "Guna is just like you, Dad."

1142
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:55,083
But what my daughter had described
about you, are you still that?

1143
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:58,708
-It wasn’t my fault.
-Let’s assume, it was not.

1144
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:03,000
If your sister got a
marriage proposal from a guy

1145
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,708
who has been to jail...
would you let her marry him?

1146
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:07,583
-Will you do it?
-I mean...

1147
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:16,375
I explained the same thing to my daughter
so that she would understand.

1148
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,917
That it's not right.

1149
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:28,417
Drink this milk.

1150
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:30,292
Drink it.

1151
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,792
Here, put this inside.

1152
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,833
Geetha...

1153
01:23:36,292 --> 01:23:37,417
why are you so dull?

1154
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,417
The boy is coming
to see you tomorrow.

1155
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,000
You need to look your best.

1156
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:42,417
Now drink your milk
and go to bed.

1157
01:23:42,792 --> 01:23:44,250
Not like that, Dad.

1158
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,583
Go to bed.

1159
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,583
Then, why have you brought me up?
You know I'm right,

1160
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:52,542
and that my choices were
right from my childhood.

1161
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:56,292
Now, I feel this is also
right, Dad.

1162
01:23:56,542 --> 01:23:59,083
You chose everything for me

1163
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,625
and I thought it was right for you and
that is why I never opposed you.

1164
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:02,708
But...

1165
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,500
now I don’t feel this is
right, dear.

1166
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,500
That was a mistake Guna
made without knowing.

1167
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:09,750
A mistake is a mistake,
even if it was done knowingly or not.

1168
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:10,917
Forget it.

1169
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:13,042
I am a simple man who thinks of
what will happen to his reputation

1170
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:16,750
if people saw a police van
near his house.

1171
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:21,000
How can I make a son-in-law
of a man who’s been to jail?

1172
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:23,750
What is this, Dad?
Why are you worried about people?

1173
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,167
A reputation is like a weight we
carry on ourselves unknowingly.

1174
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,708
Great! Great, dear.
What you said is right.

1175
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,375
We taught you
about good and bad.

1176
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,417
But, once you grew up,

1177
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,708
you are teaching us
lessons with a tight slap on our face.

1178
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:41,583
If we agree with whatever you
say, then we are good.

1179
01:24:41,667 --> 01:24:43,542
If not, we look like the devil, right?

1180
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:44,958
Not like that, Dad.

1181
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:46,542
What do you mean?

1182
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:49,042
The worries of children
are not their own...

1183
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:50,583
it is the worry
of the parents.

1184
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:53,833
If you are even a little
sad, we feel sadder than you.

1185
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,583
Okay, dear.

1186
01:24:57,667 --> 01:24:58,542
It’s your wish.

1187
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:01,333
Even after I told you all this,

1188
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:03,458
if you still want to be with
Guna, you can leave now.

1189
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,625
Even if you marry the
one I choose for you

1190
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,000
or if you marry Guna,
I will be there for you.

1191
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:13,500
Because I am still your father.

1192
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,958
But after you marry Guna, you will not
take

1193
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:22,250
those seven steps around the holy fire...

1194
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:24,875
but around my funeral pyre.

1195
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:37,417
My daughter has taken
a good decision.

1196
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,750
As a daughter,
she hasn’t let me down.

1197
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,125
As a lover,
she hasn’t let you down as well.

1198
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,250
I am your daughter, Dad.

1199
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,167
I cannot marry someone else,

1200
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,917
and promising to be
with him all my life.

1201
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:46,167
<i>This is venom for heart</i>

1202
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:52,167
<i>It feels like a death</i>
<i>For every second</i>

1203
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:58,083
<i>If I cannot see you in front of me</i>

1204
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:03,625
<i>My life becomes disturbed</i>

1205
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:26,000
Till now the best part
of my life was my family.

1206
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:28,375
From now on, it's you too.

1207
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,708
<i>You are my life</i>

1208
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:43,208
<i>You are love</i>

1209
01:27:43,292 --> 01:27:46,208
<i>You are with me</i>

1210
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:53,792
<i>Stay with me</i>

1211
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:59,917
<i>My heart yearns for you</i>

1212
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:04,958
<i>I look for you</i>

1213
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:10,000
<i>I want you by my side</i>

1214
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:15,292
<i>You and me are meant to be</i>

1215
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:17,667
<i>Forever and always</i>

1216
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:21,792
<i>I need you, my love</i>

1217
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:27,375
<i>I need you</i>

1218
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:32,042
<i>I can only live in your light</i>

1219
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:37,417
<i>I need you</i>

1220
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:37,333
What has my family done?
Brother, it’s my fault.

1221
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:39,417
-Hey, no!
-If you want, kill me, brother.

1222
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,250
Leave my family, brother.

1223
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:42,708
You want me to leave your
family, right?

1224
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:46,000
The pain we felt when our brother
died, you should feel it too!

1225
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:47,625
-Hey!
-Guna...

1226
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:49,833
Hey, I am telling you don't do this!

1227
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,750
-Dad!
-Dear!

1228
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,125
Brother... Dad...

1229
01:31:34,917 --> 01:31:36,042
What is this?

1230
01:31:37,417 --> 01:31:39,042
My son is gold.

1231
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:43,208
Because he doesn’t want to trouble me,
so he works hard himself.

1232
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:45,792
He used to proudly
tell everyone about this.

1233
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,792
Then why have you brought
so much trouble here?

1234
01:31:50,417 --> 01:31:53,042
"He won’t trouble me", he said.

1235
01:31:56,167 --> 01:31:57,333
Let us observe him for an hour.

1236
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:00,500
Hello, doctor?

1237
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:02,667
There's nothing to worry about.

1238
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:05,750
He cut his hand,
so there has been some nerve damage.

1239
01:32:05,917 --> 01:32:07,208
But he’ll be fine
in a year’s time.

1240
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:10,167
We will shift him to
the room this evening.

1241
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,667
Doctor, can we see him?

1242
01:32:12,917 --> 01:32:14,125
Any one of you can go inside.

1243
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:15,708
Nurse, give me the medicine slip.

1244
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:20,417
Go and see him.

1245
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:56,083
Hey, dear...

1246
01:32:57,542 --> 01:32:59,083
Come.

1247
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,500
Are you crying?

1248
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:06,417
What is it, son?

1249
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,458
What is it, son?

1250
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:13,833
Is it because they cut my hand?

1251
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:17,583
It's okay.

1252
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,875
You are there now, son.

1253
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,250
It's enough for me.

1254
01:33:47,417 --> 01:33:48,792
Your sister...

1255
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:00,542
Take care of everything, son.

1256
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,083
Don’t cry, Mom.

1257
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,500
Don’t cry.

1258
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,250
Nothing will happen.

1259
01:34:18,917 --> 01:34:19,917
Sit down.

1260
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:23,125
She will be back.

1261
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:24,750
I’ll get her.

1262
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,667
Take care of Dad.

1263
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:34,208
Nothing will happen,
she will be back!

1264
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:43,583
My sister will be back.

1265
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:53,750
People like us get scared
of people like you,

1266
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:57,417
and sit quietly if there’s a fight,
not because something will happen to us!

1267
01:34:58,042 --> 01:35:01,958
But...
do you know...

1268
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:05,708
if something
happens to them,

1269
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:10,417
then it is not fear that you will see,
but something much more!

1270
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,750
Go inside.

1271
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:28,833
Nothing to fear. Go inside.

1272
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:32,875
Go.

1273
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:39,750
I’ve risked everything and come.
I will burn you down.

1274
01:38:39,875 --> 01:38:40,917
Did I kill him?

1275
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:45,000
How do I know who
your enemies are?

1276
01:38:45,542 --> 01:38:48,417
If not these guys,
then someone else would have done it.

1277
01:38:49,167 --> 01:38:51,333
Do whatever you like with me.
I told you it was not my fault.

1278
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:53,250
What has my family done?

1279
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:57,500
Come on. Come you, idiots. Come.

1280
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:01,000
I am here to answer one person.

1281
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:08,833
I didn’t do it on
purpose, madam.

1282
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:13,083
I went to do good
and came across evil.

1283
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,917
But even I asked them to
do whatever with me,

1284
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:21,083
they unjustly chopped
off my dad’s hand.

1285
01:39:25,417 --> 01:39:28,417
If you want to kill
someone, then kill me.

1286
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:32,875
But leave my family alone.

1287
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:35,208
Why are you talking about my family?

1288
01:39:36,167 --> 01:39:38,708
Your father only lost his hand.

1289
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:43,958
My son lost his head.

1290
01:39:45,917 --> 01:39:48,000
I had to cremate
his headless body.

1291
01:39:48,542 --> 01:39:51,042
What did you say? Kill you?

1292
01:39:51,208 --> 01:39:52,708
If we had to kill you,

1293
01:39:53,917 --> 01:39:58,333
the moment you stepped out of the
jail we would have killed you.

1294
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:01,625
If we wanted to kill your family,

1295
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:04,292
we would have killed them
the moment you went to jail.

1296
01:40:05,542 --> 01:40:08,083
I wanted you to know how it feels

1297
01:40:08,292 --> 01:40:12,125
when something bad happens
to someone you care about.

1298
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:17,542
I am going to make your
mother and sister homeless.

1299
01:40:19,292 --> 01:40:23,583
I am going to make your dad
run around like a mad dog.

1300
01:40:25,667 --> 01:40:29,750
What? Since you have come, you were
saying you were going to burn us down.

1301
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,625
Let’s see you do it.

1302
01:40:33,042 --> 01:40:35,542
If we lose ten people,
there will be another ten.

1303
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:36,917
Then another ten people.

1304
01:40:37,042 --> 01:40:39,500
They will keep coming at you.
Will you stop them?

1305
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:43,375
Because you said it was not your fault
and are worried about your family,

1306
01:40:43,458 --> 01:40:47,125
and have fallen on my feet
begging for mercy.

1307
01:40:48,792 --> 01:40:50,875
I will give you a chance.

1308
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:55,000
You have only a week’s time.

1309
01:40:55,917 --> 01:41:00,208
I want to see the death
of all those people

1310
01:41:01,125 --> 01:41:04,542
who murdered my son.

1311
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,208
You have to catch them.

1312
01:41:10,083 --> 01:41:13,208
Even if an hour past the week’s
time I gave you comes to pass...

1313
01:41:14,792 --> 01:41:18,917
then whatever I said will
happen,

1314
01:41:19,917 --> 01:41:21,333
one after the other.

1315
01:41:21,917 --> 01:41:23,458
After that, it’s up to you.

1316
01:41:26,542 --> 01:41:27,833
<i>It’s my fault.</i>

1317
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,083
<i>I helped those idiots.</i>

1318
01:41:32,792 --> 01:41:34,542
<i>I have troubled my family.</i>

1319
01:41:35,667 --> 01:41:37,500
<i>I have made her sad.</i>

1320
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:40,750
<i>What she said is right.</i>

1321
01:41:42,792 --> 01:41:45,667
<i>I will not let anything</i>
<i>happen to those I call my own.</i>

1322
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:50,833
<i>I will not let anything</i>
<i>happen to those I call my own.</i>

1323
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:57,708
<i>Grief has left me,</i>
<i>In a merciful time like this</i>

1324
01:41:57,792 --> 01:42:03,042
<i>The life I wanted,</i>
<i>Is now destroyed by the darkness</i>

1325
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:08,417
<i>Even though my tears cannot express</i>
<i>The pain I feel in words</i>

1326
01:42:08,625 --> 01:42:13,750
<i>I feel the anguish that</i>
<i>Never seems to end</i>

1327
01:42:13,917 --> 01:42:19,125
<i>Even though I tried to help</i>
<i>It has only led me to the dungeons</i>

1328
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:25,125
<i>The culpability that was misguided</i>
<i>Has now wrapped itself around you</i>

1329
01:42:48,167 --> 01:42:53,458
<i>Am I not just a pawn</i>
<i>In someone’s revenge?</i>

1330
01:42:53,583 --> 01:42:58,042
<i>Even though I am walking into a nightmare</i>

1331
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:04,458
<i>Even though I haven’t committed a crime</i>
<i>I am now a criminal</i>

1332
01:43:04,542 --> 01:43:09,708
<i>All the beautiful love I had</i>
<i>Is now withering away</i>

1333
01:43:09,792 --> 01:43:12,625
<i>The help I gave without thinking</i>

1334
01:43:12,708 --> 01:43:15,292
<i>Has fulfilled its justice</i>
<i>By placing the blame on me</i>

1335
01:43:15,542 --> 01:43:20,458
<i>Even though there are many directions</i>
<i>I am now directionless</i>

1336
01:43:20,542 --> 01:43:25,792
<i>My tears cannot express</i>
<i>The pain I feel in words</i>

1337
01:43:25,917 --> 01:43:31,042
<i>I feel the anguish that</i>
<i>Never seems to end</i>

1338
01:43:31,292 --> 01:43:36,458
<i>Even though I tried to help</i>
<i>It has only led me to the dungeons</i>

1339
01:43:36,542 --> 01:43:42,042
<i>The culpability that was misguided</i>
<i>Has now wrapped itself around you</i>

1340
01:43:55,917 --> 01:43:57,292
-Sit down.
-Uncle?

1341
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,583
Did you find out
anything about them?

1342
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:08,250
Sorry, bro.

1343
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:11,583
Just like everyone else,
I didn’t want to get involved.

1344
01:44:12,667 --> 01:44:14,458
But I feel like
telling you about it.

1345
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:17,625
Raghu is someone from the batch.

1346
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:21,000
He used to work in the same shop like me.

1347
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,542
He has a lover.

1348
01:44:27,917 --> 01:44:31,125
I saw them once...
in Bhagyanagar at an apartment.

1349
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:34,042
When I inquired,
I came to know that the girl lives there.

1350
01:44:34,542 --> 01:44:38,167
Maybe if you ask her,
she may have some information for you.

1351
01:44:40,417 --> 01:44:42,125
Thanks a lot, uncle.

1352
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,500
Tell me.

1353
01:45:20,792 --> 01:45:23,583
About Raghu...

1354
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:26,500
Who’s Raghu?

1355
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:31,750
I know Raghu is your boyfriend.

1356
01:45:31,917 --> 01:45:36,417
Will any girl tell you about her
boyfriend, if you ask her?

1357
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:40,375
She will tell you...

1358
01:45:41,625 --> 01:45:45,000
if you can give her something
more than her boyfriend.

1359
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:47,333
What will you give me?

1360
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:51,958
I will give you
whatever you want.

1361
01:45:58,667 --> 01:45:59,792
Come on.

1362
01:46:03,833 --> 01:46:07,583
Here I am, burning up because
someone set me on fire.

1363
01:46:08,042 --> 01:46:11,167
And you are asking me to stand
still so that you could warm up.

1364
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:12,958
Okay.

1365
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:16,542
Okay!

1366
01:46:28,917 --> 01:46:29,917
This is wrong.

1367
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:34,208
A woman who loved me dearly
gave up her life for me.

1368
01:46:35,292 --> 01:46:39,250
When she valued me so much, I cannot
do something meaningless like this.

1369
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:43,250
When a woman promises someone
that she will be with him forever...

1370
01:46:43,333 --> 01:46:45,000
she will be with
him till she dies...

1371
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:46,625
like my Geetha.

1372
01:46:46,708 --> 01:46:50,667
Because of women like you,
everyone thinks all women are like that.

1373
01:46:51,417 --> 01:46:53,542
They are not.
Women are not like that.

1374
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,292
They are very sincere.

1375
01:46:55,708 --> 01:46:56,708
Wait.

1376
01:46:57,542 --> 01:47:00,583
If you really love someone,
then they are very sincere,

1377
01:47:00,667 --> 01:47:02,042
is what I learned by looking at you.

1378
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:05,625
Raghu came by recently.

1379
01:47:06,625 --> 01:47:11,417
I don’t know where exactly is that.
But I know he’s in Ongole.

1380
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,083
Come.

1381
01:47:18,167 --> 01:47:19,875
We will play the game
"Police versus thieves."

1382
01:47:19,958 --> 01:47:22,292
I am the police and
you are the thieves.

1383
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:33,292
Yes, we are ready.

1384
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:47,792
All the thieves in their place!

1385
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:58,542
We are hiding in his spot and yet,
why hasn’t he caught us?

1386
01:47:58,625 --> 01:48:01,667
He doesn’t know
we will hide here.

1387
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:04,708
My grandfather
used to say that...

1388
01:48:04,792 --> 01:48:08,708
if a thief hid in the police’s house then
even the police cannot catch him.

1389
01:48:08,792 --> 01:48:10,167
We are thieves, right?

1390
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,500
He is the police.

1391
01:48:11,667 --> 01:48:15,208
How will he know that
we will hide in his place?

1392
01:48:15,292 --> 01:48:17,000
He will never guess.

1393
01:48:22,292 --> 01:48:24,083
Tell me. What do you want?

1394
01:48:24,333 --> 01:48:27,333
Sir, will you tell me if
you know the police?

1395
01:48:27,417 --> 01:48:28,250
For what?

1396
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:30,750
Sasi and his guys are in Ongole.

1397
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:32,417
What do you mean
they are in Ongole?

1398
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,458
The police have combed
through the whole of Ongole.

1399
01:48:34,542 --> 01:48:36,417
How do you know that?

1400
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,083
They are hiding in the
police's house.

1401
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:41,542
He’s in Ongole.

1402
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:43,250
How will he catch us?

1403
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:45,833
If a thief hid in the police’s house
even then police cannot catch him.

1404
01:48:45,917 --> 01:48:47,167
You said it yourself that...

1405
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:49,583
the police have combed
through Ongole.

1406
01:48:50,208 --> 01:48:51,500
But still, haven’t caught him.

1407
01:48:51,583 --> 01:48:54,417
You are talking in frustration because
you haven’t found Sasi’s gang.

1408
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:57,333
Are they someone great,
that the police will support them?

1409
01:48:57,417 --> 01:48:59,958
Before you believe in something,
don’t you think if it’s right or wrong?

1410
01:49:00,042 --> 01:49:04,083
Okay, sir. Tell me.
What do you think?

1411
01:49:04,167 --> 01:49:06,333
What should I do? Which way
should I go searching for them?

1412
01:49:06,542 --> 01:49:08,875
Sir, my situation is
like being in a desert.

1413
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:11,542
I cannot see anything
else but sand dunes.

1414
01:49:12,917 --> 01:49:14,250
I am very thirsty.

1415
01:49:15,042 --> 01:49:17,667
At that time,
I have found only a little water.

1416
01:49:18,708 --> 01:49:23,417
I do not have the time or strength to
think, if that water is good or bad.

1417
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,333
I will have to drink
it to quench my thirst.

1418
01:49:25,417 --> 01:49:27,542
If you believe, then tell me.
Otherwise...

1419
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:31,125
There is an SI in One
Town called Sivaji.

1420
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:33,000
I will call him.
You go meet him.

1421
01:49:39,417 --> 01:49:41,833
Yes. Cool.

1422
01:49:45,333 --> 01:49:46,208
It’s okay, sir.

1423
01:49:46,917 --> 01:49:47,750
Have it.

1424
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,333
It's nice.

1425
01:49:54,083 --> 01:49:56,125
So, you mean to say they
are still in Ongole.

1426
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,250
And that too in the police's houses.

1427
01:49:59,417 --> 01:50:00,333
Yes, sir.

1428
01:50:00,417 --> 01:50:03,083
Or if I am mad to listen to this. I don’t
know if you are mad for telling me this.

1429
01:50:03,542 --> 01:50:04,708
Tell me.

1430
01:50:04,792 --> 01:50:07,625
Do you want me to listen to you
and look in the police's house?

1431
01:50:07,708 --> 01:50:11,542
As far as I know, they have no
relations or friends in the police.

1432
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:12,667
Look here.

1433
01:50:13,042 --> 01:50:17,750
After the murder, they escaped us here
and are said to have gone to Anantapur.

1434
01:50:18,417 --> 01:50:20,167
We are in touch with the police
there, as well.

1435
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:22,500
Don’t know how,
but they escaped the police there too.

1436
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:25,333
No, sir. You are looking
for them in the wrong place.

1437
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:26,292
Really?

1438
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:28,292
Why do you speak like a blind
person, when you can clearly see?

1439
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:30,333
I can see clearly, sir.

1440
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:33,958
But the direction I am going
is pitch dark and scary.

1441
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:39,667
I am hopeful that I may see
a ray of light somewhere.

1442
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:42,000
Come.

1443
01:50:47,250 --> 01:50:48,583
Sir, no, sir.

1444
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:50,750
Take it. Will I save this
money and build a building?

1445
01:50:52,625 --> 01:50:53,458
Do one thing.

1446
01:50:54,042 --> 01:50:56,417
Go search for the light.

1447
01:50:59,708 --> 01:51:01,375
-You come to the station.
-Okay, sir.

1448
01:51:02,042 --> 01:51:03,458
Hey, elderly person, what is it?

1449
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:06,375
-You’ve asked me to come and meet you.
-I will take care of the case.

1450
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:07,333
Okay.

1451
01:51:07,417 --> 01:51:08,250
Is that all?

1452
01:51:08,333 --> 01:51:09,250
I mean...

1453
01:51:09,333 --> 01:51:10,333
Listen, elderly person.

1454
01:51:10,417 --> 01:51:12,792
If we asked you to come here and not
to the station, you should understand.

1455
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:14,250
Ah, I understood.

1456
01:51:16,583 --> 01:51:20,083
-Only, you can get him out.
-Think your work is done.

1457
01:51:20,167 --> 01:51:21,042
Okay.

1458
01:52:27,042 --> 01:52:28,917
That Guna is not
an ordinary fellow.

1459
01:52:29,292 --> 01:52:31,917
He has information that
even the police don’t.

1460
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,042
He was discussing it with me,

1461
01:52:36,125 --> 01:52:38,542
not knowing that I am the police
who has given you shelter.

1462
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,792
If he has found out so much,
then he is sure to catch you soon.

1463
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,375
There’s no doubt.

1464
01:53:06,917 --> 01:53:08,542
Hey, it’s Guna.

1465
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:14,625
You go open the door.
Open it slowly.

1466
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:20,292
It’s you. What is it?

1467
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:22,833
We met that time
on that matter...

1468
01:53:22,917 --> 01:53:24,042
I told you there itself.

1469
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:26,250
Well, sir.

1470
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:27,167
What is it?

1471
01:53:27,250 --> 01:53:28,458
-A bribe?
-I mean, sir.

1472
01:53:28,667 --> 01:53:29,667
It’s only because I know that
person who introduced us,

1473
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:30,792
I have kept quiet.

1474
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:31,708
Otherwise, I would have put
you behind bars then itself.

1475
01:53:31,792 --> 01:53:32,625
Sir?

1476
01:53:32,708 --> 01:53:34,958
What do you think of me?
Hey, get away from here.

1477
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:37,292
I am telling you! Why are you
coming in like that? Sir... sir...

1478
01:53:37,708 --> 01:53:38,542
Go!

1479
01:55:02,292 --> 01:55:03,750
Let’s go. Let’s go.

1480
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:06,000
Run! Run!

1481
01:55:55,292 --> 01:55:59,167
<i>The drum of Lord Shiva is making a sound</i>
<i>Dham dham dham dham</i>

1482
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:01,417
<i>When the raging torrents make you run</i>

1483
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,292
<i>Like Keechaka</i>
<i>You will be killed in sacrifice</i>

1484
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:11,167
<i>The drum of Lord Shiva is making a sound</i>
<i>Dham dham dham dham</i>

1485
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:15,167
<i>When the bolts of lightning make you run</i>
<i>Many demons are killed in sacrifice</i>

1486
01:56:15,250 --> 01:56:19,125
<i>Won’t evil be destroyed</i>
<i>If it infuriates the heart of a saint?</i>

1487
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:23,083
<i>Won’t destruction be eliminated</i>
<i>If a kind-hearted man wants revenge?</i>

1488
01:56:23,167 --> 01:56:27,083
<i>Won’t brutalities end</i>
<i>If Lord Shiva is after you?</i>

1489
01:56:27,167 --> 01:56:31,083
<i>Won’t the terrorists be disposed of</i>
<i>By Lord Shiva if He sets his mind to it?</i>

1490
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,875
<i>Oblation... oblation...</i>

1491
01:56:38,042 --> 01:56:40,167
<i>Oblation... oblation...</i>

1492
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:42,125
<i>Oblation... oblation...</i>

1493
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:43,958
<i>Oblation... oblation...</i>

1494
01:56:44,208 --> 01:56:46,000
<i>Oblation... oblation...</i>

1495
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:47,875
<i>Oblation... oblation...</i>

1496
01:56:48,208 --> 01:56:50,042
<i>Oblation... oblation...</i>

1497
01:56:50,208 --> 01:56:51,708
<i>Oblation... oblation...</i>

1498
01:57:07,125 --> 01:57:10,875
<i>These feet are on fire</i>
<i>This is the destruction of evil</i>

1499
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,958
<i>The graveyard is where</i>
<i>The courageous Lord Shiva resides</i>

1500
01:57:15,083 --> 01:57:16,833
<i>This is the calm before the storm</i>

1501
01:57:16,917 --> 01:57:18,792
<i>This is an act of fearlessness</i>

1502
01:57:19,042 --> 01:57:22,958
<i>This is the rage of one</i>
<i>Who had drunk the poison and absorbed it</i>

1503
01:59:44,042 --> 01:59:46,500
Thank you for calling me now.

1504
01:59:46,917 --> 01:59:48,333
Don’t worry.

1505
01:59:48,458 --> 01:59:51,667
We will catch Sasi and his gang,
and hand them over to Radha’s mother.

1506
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:52,625
Okay?

1507
01:59:55,583 --> 01:59:57,250
Then we will be
out of this fight.

1508
02:00:22,625 --> 02:00:23,458
Dad?

1509
02:00:24,792 --> 02:00:25,708
Hello, Guna?

1510
02:00:25,958 --> 02:00:28,083
You said your son was
like your right hand.

1511
02:00:29,125 --> 02:00:34,625
But for a few days,
you will not have your son, Dad.

1512
02:00:37,625 --> 02:00:38,917
What are you talking about?

1513
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:42,250
I have taught a lesson
to whoever betrayed us.

1514
02:00:43,167 --> 02:00:44,958
I am going to jail again.

1515
02:00:47,292 --> 02:00:48,958
Son... what do you mean?

1516
02:00:50,125 --> 02:00:53,958
I will be the son you always wanted, Dad.

1517
02:00:54,333 --> 02:00:57,958
But once I am back from jail...

1518
02:00:58,542 --> 02:01:00,792
Hey, son. Leave all that.

1519
02:01:01,292 --> 02:01:02,917
Come to me, son. Come to me.

1520
02:01:03,250 --> 02:01:04,083
Guna?

1521
02:01:04,417 --> 02:01:05,667
What are you talking about?

1522
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:07,167
Why would you go to jail again?

1523
02:01:34,292 --> 02:01:35,667
I will cut them in pieces.

1524
02:01:36,958 --> 02:01:41,583
I will not spare anyone
who’s betrayed me.

1525
02:01:42,833 --> 02:01:44,208
I will chop them up.

1526
02:01:46,583 --> 02:01:47,958
What happened to you?

1527
02:01:48,042 --> 02:01:49,375
Do you have any sense?

1528
02:01:49,458 --> 02:01:53,542
If you know where they are, why not take
them to Radha’s mother...

1529
02:01:53,625 --> 02:01:56,250
and let her decide if they want
to cut them up or kill them?

1530
02:01:56,333 --> 02:01:57,875
Why are you getting involved?

1531
02:01:57,958 --> 02:01:59,083
Do you want to go to jail again?

1532
02:01:59,167 --> 02:02:00,667
Why have you become like this?

1533
02:02:02,917 --> 02:02:06,125
How much do you love your friend?

1534
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,792
If you really
loved me so much...

1535
02:02:14,917 --> 02:02:16,417
then why did you do that?

1536
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:21,750
Why did you do it?

1537
02:02:23,292 --> 02:02:25,125
Why did you do it?

1538
02:02:25,667 --> 02:02:28,292
Radha has agreed to compromise.
Everything is fine.

1539
02:02:28,375 --> 02:02:30,125
He also asked me to
decide on a place to meet.

1540
02:02:30,292 --> 02:02:31,125
Okay.

1541
02:02:31,250 --> 02:02:34,417
I will take him there.
Ask Sashi to be ready tomorrow.

1542
02:02:36,292 --> 02:02:37,458
What happened, Battu?

1543
02:02:37,542 --> 02:02:38,375
It’s done.

1544
02:02:38,458 --> 02:02:39,917
Guna will come and take you.

1545
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,875
If you fall on Radha’s feet
and ask him to forgive you,

1546
02:02:41,958 --> 02:02:43,833
then you will
reach a compromise.

1547
02:02:47,542 --> 02:02:50,375
If we apologize then we will survive.

1548
02:02:51,167 --> 02:02:53,292
What do you mean?

1549
02:02:53,792 --> 02:02:55,167
He’s Radha.

1550
02:02:55,792 --> 02:02:57,500
He will hack you to pieces.

1551
02:02:59,542 --> 02:03:00,792
Then what do we do?

1552
02:03:01,208 --> 02:03:02,583
What will you do?

1553
02:03:02,917 --> 02:03:07,042
Either you die by Radha’s
hand or he dies by your hand.

1554
02:03:07,125 --> 02:03:08,417
What if we run away?

1555
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:11,750
You want to run away.
Where will you go?

1556
02:03:11,875 --> 02:03:15,208
Do you want to run away
leaving your family behind?

1557
02:03:15,542 --> 02:03:19,292
If he finds them, he will slaughter them,
and you will not even know!

1558
02:03:20,417 --> 02:03:21,458
Then what do we do?

1559
02:03:21,542 --> 02:03:25,375
Either you die or he dies.
I told you, right?

1560
02:03:25,917 --> 02:03:28,250
Hey! How can he dare to kill us?

1561
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:29,750
We will only kill him!

1562
02:03:29,833 --> 02:03:31,125
Yes, we’ll kill him!

1563
02:03:33,917 --> 02:03:39,125
You said you were my friend,
stay right next to me and betrayed me.

1564
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:41,417
I didn’t do it on
purpose, brother.

1565
02:03:42,875 --> 02:03:44,750
He hit my dad.

1566
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,917
He dragged my mother.

1567
02:03:53,708 --> 02:03:55,542
He beat up my brother.

1568
02:03:58,583 --> 02:04:01,083
We lost our respect in
front of our whole village.

1569
02:04:15,125 --> 02:04:16,625
That’s why I did it.

1570
02:04:17,542 --> 02:04:18,542
I’m sorry.

1571
02:04:19,167 --> 02:04:22,167
Hey, why are you saying sorry?

1572
02:04:23,333 --> 02:04:25,833
You reacted because
he attacked your family.

1573
02:04:27,125 --> 02:04:29,750
Didn’t I kill,
when my family was involved?

1574
02:04:30,542 --> 02:04:31,625
You have to kill.

1575
02:04:32,125 --> 02:04:33,875
If you kill then
you are the son.

1576
02:04:35,542 --> 02:04:40,625
I wanted to leave them after I
beat them up to my heart’s content

1577
02:04:42,167 --> 02:04:45,000
and that is why they
killed him out of fear.

1578
02:04:45,083 --> 02:04:48,000
They were scared that
Radha would kill them.

1579
02:04:49,333 --> 02:04:52,583
Because your family was
attacked, you behaved that way.

1580
02:04:54,542 --> 02:04:59,750
That is why, even though it was really
difficult, I thought I would bear it...

1581
02:05:00,708 --> 02:05:02,083
and let it be.

1582
02:05:04,125 --> 02:05:04,958
But...

1583
02:05:14,083 --> 02:05:16,583
But... that police
said something.

1584
02:05:19,667 --> 02:05:25,542
If I let you go even
after listening to that...

1585
02:05:27,875 --> 02:05:29,917
then it will be my mistake.

1586
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,917
Hey, there was no fault of mine.

1587
02:05:33,125 --> 02:05:34,667
Not your fault?

1588
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:37,042
It was not my fault.

1589
02:05:37,542 --> 02:05:39,500
Not your fault?

1590
02:05:39,917 --> 02:05:40,875
No...

1591
02:05:41,292 --> 02:05:43,750
Not your fault?

1592
02:05:44,417 --> 02:05:46,292
Not your fault?

1593
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:58,458
I need to talk to you.

1594
02:05:58,792 --> 02:06:02,375
I am outside.
A little outside of town.

1595
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,250
It’s okay. I will come to you.

1596
02:06:08,917 --> 02:06:11,375
Brother,
I have to speak to you urgently.

1597
02:06:11,458 --> 02:06:12,333
Okay.

1598
02:06:19,375 --> 02:06:21,125
Hey, what a figure.

1599
02:06:21,375 --> 02:06:22,208
Hey, look.

1600
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:25,250
She made us enjoy
a lot that day.

1601
02:06:25,333 --> 02:06:26,167
Yes...

1602
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:28,083
You were the one who said,
"let’s not take a video."

1603
02:06:28,167 --> 02:06:30,000
Because of the video he
took, now we can enjoy it.

1604
02:06:30,083 --> 02:06:32,083
But that day, we had good fun.

1605
02:06:32,542 --> 02:06:34,417
Whatever it is,
this girl was great.

1606
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:36,667
He came with him
and married him.

1607
02:06:39,125 --> 02:06:42,250
Hey, Battu. She is the one
who is saving us all.

1608
02:06:44,292 --> 02:06:46,833
We are happy
because of such girls.

1609
02:06:46,917 --> 02:06:49,417
She was born to satisfy us.

1610
02:06:49,667 --> 02:06:53,125
Which father will be able to bear it,
if we show his naked daughter around town?

1611
02:06:53,208 --> 02:06:57,292
Right, brother. He knows if he talks
about us, this video will go viral.

1612
02:06:57,375 --> 02:07:00,875
Now, he has to keep quiet and
watch, no matter what we do.

1613
02:07:00,958 --> 02:07:05,583
Till there are wrong girls like that,
wrong guys like us will always have fun.

1614
02:07:07,417 --> 02:07:09,417
This is fun.

1615
02:07:09,542 --> 02:07:12,583
I can do this for the rest of my life.

1616
02:07:25,792 --> 02:07:27,375
What is it?
At this time of night?

1617
02:07:27,458 --> 02:07:28,292
Brother...

1618
02:07:29,167 --> 02:07:30,042
Brother that is...

1619
02:07:30,583 --> 02:07:32,583
the threshold of Guna’s
house, he will kill himself.

1620
02:07:32,667 --> 02:07:34,417
Brother,
Dad is saying that if I ever cross

1621
02:07:35,792 --> 02:07:38,792
I won’t marry anyone
else, but Guna.

1622
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:43,750
But I don’t know what to do.

1623
02:07:45,792 --> 02:07:47,000
Help me, brother.

1624
02:07:48,375 --> 02:07:50,208
I don’t know anyone but you.

1625
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:02,875
Brother, these people...

1626
02:08:03,792 --> 02:08:04,917
Brother?

1627
02:08:05,667 --> 02:08:06,750
Brother, you...

1628
02:08:12,667 --> 02:08:14,167
You...

1629
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:47,625
Leave me.

1630
02:08:49,458 --> 02:08:51,542
No! No!

1631
02:08:52,167 --> 02:08:53,375
Leave me.

1632
02:08:54,167 --> 02:08:56,167
Leave me.

1633
02:09:42,167 --> 02:09:46,542
Hey, what are you doing here after
getting us this super figure?

1634
02:09:47,417 --> 02:09:50,833
He cannot do it.
You think he is some big man or what?

1635
02:09:50,917 --> 02:09:52,667
Hey, aren’t you a man?

1636
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:56,500
That is the girl you brought us.
Go.

1637
02:10:14,542 --> 02:10:17,542
If anyone lays a hand on him
then how can I keep silent?

1638
02:10:26,708 --> 02:10:27,750
Don't do this.

1639
02:10:33,958 --> 02:10:35,292
Don't do this.

1640
02:10:44,833 --> 02:10:46,458
Hey, untie her.

1641
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,250
She may tell someone
if she goes out.

1642
02:10:49,542 --> 02:10:54,083
If this video goes viral, her father
will have a heart attack. She will not.

1643
02:10:54,417 --> 02:10:56,417
Her boyfriend,
who is in jail will go mad.

1644
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:57,958
She knows it.

1645
02:10:58,250 --> 02:11:00,750
That's why I did a little more.

1646
02:11:01,167 --> 02:11:02,958
It was fun.

1647
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,583
She was super fun.

1648
02:11:06,667 --> 02:11:08,375
Hey, give me a cigarette.

1649
02:11:13,625 --> 02:11:16,625
Hey, instead of going home,
she is going up there.

1650
02:11:16,708 --> 02:11:20,083
Hey, first light the
cigarette, brother. Here.

1651
02:11:38,417 --> 02:11:41,125
No matter how high she goes, she has to
come down. Where will she go?

1652
02:11:46,667 --> 02:11:49,292
Unnecessarily we have brought
another one on our heads.

1653
02:11:49,875 --> 02:11:51,833
They will think that
since the parents

1654
02:11:51,917 --> 02:11:53,583
didn’t accept her lover
so she committed suicide.

1655
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:56,125
If there is a postmortem,
they will know everything.

1656
02:11:56,208 --> 02:11:59,833
Hey, the police we have has to do
something. He will manage everything.

1657
02:12:44,333 --> 02:12:49,458
To protect my own daughter, I could not
save your daughter from this injustice.

1658
02:12:51,292 --> 02:12:53,000
Please forgive me.

1659
02:13:01,958 --> 02:13:04,250
<i>He is the ruler</i>

1660
02:13:04,333 --> 02:13:06,375
<i>He is here</i>

1661
02:13:06,458 --> 02:13:08,625
<i>All bow down to him</i>

1662
02:13:08,708 --> 02:13:10,667
<i>The ones at fault will fear</i>

1663
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:12,958
<i>He is the master of masters</i>

1664
02:13:13,042 --> 02:13:14,958
<i>He is the king of kings</i>

1665
02:13:15,083 --> 02:13:17,292
<i>The evil will be doomed</i>

1666
02:13:17,375 --> 02:13:19,583
<i>Only truth will reign</i>

1667
02:13:25,708 --> 02:13:30,292
She thought you would be her support,
called you brother and came to you.

1668
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:35,833
You killed her instead of
saving and protecting her.

1669
02:13:35,917 --> 02:13:38,583
Please, no.

1670
02:13:38,667 --> 02:13:40,542
What do I do with
people like you?

1671
02:13:41,333 --> 02:13:42,292
What do I do?

1672
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,958
What do I do? What do I do?

1673
02:13:46,042 --> 02:13:47,667
What do I do?

1674
02:13:53,833 --> 02:13:56,583
What do I do?

1675
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,750
This one... This! This!

1676
02:13:59,917 --> 02:14:02,458
These are the videos you take!
Damn!

1677
02:14:02,667 --> 02:14:04,833
This is the video
that has to go viral!

1678
02:14:04,917 --> 02:14:08,458
Are you filming? Are you?
Take it. What?

1679
02:14:08,958 --> 02:14:14,458
You betray girls and proudly
parade around like men!

1680
02:14:18,625 --> 02:14:20,208
Let him watch!

1681
02:14:20,292 --> 02:14:21,750
Let him watch!

1682
02:14:21,917 --> 02:14:26,375
You watch all irrelevant things.
Now this is what you have to watch!

1683
02:14:27,375 --> 02:14:31,750
Why am I killing him?
What has he done?

1684
02:14:31,833 --> 02:14:34,750
Either he won’t do it or
he will stop another one from doing it!

1685
02:14:45,667 --> 02:14:50,583
Courts may have no
answers nor tears for guys like you.

1686
02:14:50,667 --> 02:14:54,083
But the knife in my hand
will teach you a lesson.

1687
02:14:56,167 --> 02:15:01,125
Are you scared?
Scared?

1688
02:15:02,625 --> 02:15:05,125
Should I not kill you?
Should I not?

1689
02:15:10,917 --> 02:15:12,417
Brother, please forgive me.
Sorry, brother.

1690
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:15,083
Forgive you? Forgive you?

1691
02:15:15,167 --> 02:15:17,042
How can I forgive you?

1692
02:15:17,125 --> 02:15:19,000
Forgive you?

1693
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:24,125
Brother, please leave me!

1694
02:15:24,208 --> 02:15:26,042
Brother... I will
never do it again.

1695
02:15:26,125 --> 02:15:30,167
-Leave me, brother! Leave me, brother!
-Brother... I will never do it again.

1696
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:32,250
Leave me, brother!

1697
02:15:32,542 --> 02:15:34,417
She must have also begged like this.

1698
02:15:35,375 --> 02:15:36,500
Did you leave her?

1699
02:15:36,792 --> 02:15:37,917
Did you leave her?

1700
02:15:38,250 --> 02:15:40,417
Did you leave her?

1701
02:15:44,917 --> 02:15:46,125
How come they die
just like this?

1702
02:15:47,417 --> 02:15:48,250
Is that all?

1703
02:15:48,542 --> 02:15:50,917
No, this is not enough.

1704
02:15:51,875 --> 02:15:52,875
I need something else.

1705
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:54,333
I need something else.

1706
02:15:54,417 --> 02:15:56,458
There has to be a
bigger fear than death!

1707
02:15:56,542 --> 02:16:00,875
What is it that I can do
to make them feel that?

1708
02:16:01,875 --> 02:16:03,417
What can I do? What can I do?

1709
02:16:04,958 --> 02:16:06,542
If I do this,
will you be scared of me?

1710
02:16:06,625 --> 02:16:08,167
Will you be scared of me?

1711
02:16:10,708 --> 02:16:12,375
Will you now not
come onto women?

1712
02:16:12,458 --> 02:16:15,000
Are you now scared?
Can you feel the fear now?

1713
02:16:17,417 --> 02:16:20,750
What I am doing is not wrong.
This is right!

1714
02:16:27,333 --> 02:16:33,208
From now on any man, who has a twisted
thought and misbehaves with a woman,

1715
02:16:33,417 --> 02:16:36,542
he has to piss his
pants thinking about it!

1716
02:16:42,833 --> 02:16:47,000
Will you do it now, you idiots?
Will you touch them?

1717
02:16:48,208 --> 02:16:49,875
Will you?

1718
02:17:11,708 --> 02:17:14,833
<i>In a serene life,</i>
<i>if vengeance becomes a part of it...</i>

1719
02:17:15,417 --> 02:17:18,167
<i>its peril is more</i>
<i>dangerous than death.</i>

1720
02:17:19,083 --> 02:17:23,583
<i>Because of our mistakes,</i>
<i>the others should not be harmed.</i>

1721
02:17:24,542 --> 02:17:26,917
<i>If it happens,</i>
<i>then it’s not a mistake.</i>

1722
02:17:27,292 --> 02:17:28,250
<i>It’s a crime.</i>

1723
02:17:29,042 --> 02:17:30,542
<i>We can forgive a mistake...</i>

1724
02:17:31,250 --> 02:17:34,042
<i>but we have to punish a crime.</i>

1725
02:17:41,125 --> 02:17:44,042
<i>Guna created a</i>
<i>sensation in Andhra Pradesh.</i>

1726
02:17:44,167 --> 02:17:50,083
<i>The atrocities on women</i>
<i>are increasing day by day.</i>

1727
02:17:50,167 --> 02:17:55,292
<i>If we have to stop them,</i>
<i>the laws should instill fear in them.</i>

1728
02:17:55,375 --> 02:17:57,875
"What I have done is
correct", says, Guna.

1729
02:17:57,958 --> 02:17:59,917
<i>Many women welfare</i>
<i>associations and people</i>

1730
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,208
<i>in the country are expressing their</i>
<i>support towards Guna.</i>

1731
02:18:08,792 --> 02:18:12,458
My son, Guna is the rescue...

1732
02:18:12,542 --> 02:18:16,708
for women like this who are
targeted by rotten men.

1733
02:18:16,792 --> 02:18:18,417
FEW YEARS LATER.

1734
02:18:20,333 --> 02:18:24,542
<i>A punishment should not just scare people.</i>

1735
02:18:25,167 --> 02:18:29,708
<i>Not only will man change,</i>
<i>but even those looking at him will change.</i>

1736
02:19:08,125 --> 02:19:08,958
CENTRAL JAIL.

1737
02:19:33,167 --> 02:19:34,792
<i>I love you, dear.</i>
