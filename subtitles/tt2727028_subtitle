1
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,410
Mom, I told you please don't worry.

2
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,449
Why shouldn't I worry?

3
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,613
Why don't you give me some guidance?

4
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,547
I'm meeting him for the first time.

5
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,253
At least tell me what he likes to eat.

6
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,064
Mom, Aman likes everything.

7
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,497
You can cook anything you want.

8
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,065
Are you sure?

9
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,495
Don't complain about the food later.

10
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,696
Mom, Aman's calling.
We'll meet in the evening, okay.

11
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,739
Bye. - Bye, dear.

12
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,500
Where have you reached?

13
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,009
Yes, two minutes away.

14
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,545
Have you reached? - Yes.

15
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,575
Are you really coming?

16
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,240
You're asking that
for the fourth time.

17
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,715
Don't you trust me?

18
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,350
No, did you buy gifts?

19
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,587
Gifts, for my family.
- Yes, I did.

20
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,147
What did you buy?
- A small bomb.

21
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,991
Stop joking.
- Joking?

22
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,022
I don't joke.
I really did.

23
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,301
10-02 to Control.

24
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,228
Aman, I am really nervous.

25
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,739
Why are you nervous?

26
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,668
You know why.

27
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,139
Don't be nervous because of me?

28
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,442
Have faith in me and in God.

29
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,038
Yours or mine?

30
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,550
Whoever's on duty?

31
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,017
Where are you?

32
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:18,641
"You're like the
sweet supple fragrance."

33
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:25,317
"Like the miracle of morning."

34
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:30,418
"You're this moment."

35
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,091
"Li ke the cascade amongst the clouds."

36
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:39,332
"If I touch you, you'll fly away."

37
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:46,607
"If I hold you, you shy away."

38
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,106
"Turn around, sweetheart."

39
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,644
"Hear me and say what's on yours."

40
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:02,518
"Take me in your arms."

41
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:08,431
"My heart's feels young."

42
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,492
"Turn around, sweetheart."

43
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:16,975
"You're my dawn."

44
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,643
"The tranqui lity of my si lence."

45
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:28,654
"You're the limits of my love."

46
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,621
Aman!

47
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,656
Aman!

48
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,459
Leave. Leave.

49
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,329
Control, man down.
- Aman. Leave.

50
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,136
Leave. What the hell are you doing?

51
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,037
Leave.

52
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,612
And who do we have here?

53
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,208
Aman Ali.

54
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,618
He's a Pakistani.

55
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,083
And is that his only crime?

56
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,649
He was talking about bombing, sir.

57
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,624
And did you find something on him?

58
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,153
We found these, sir.

59
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,963
I suspect its some
form of new language..

60
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,998
.they have started to use, sir.

61
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,009
Looks like Arabic from an angle.

62
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,110
Like here...

63
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,975
...and here.

64
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,250
You see.

65
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,015
And the girl?

66
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,012
I want his clothes to
be given to him right now!

67
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,115
Right here, right now!
- She's Indian.

68
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,160
I feel she's her accomplice.

69
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,363
Like an Indo-Pak operation, sir.

70
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,628
And this guy looks like a terrorist.
Mr. Percy?

71
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,532
Don't they all?

72
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,266
It's high time we did
something about it, sir.

73
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,435
It's high time someone
put a straight jacket on you.

74
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,173
You dumba**.

75
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,416
Release him at once and
say sorry for your stupidity.

76
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,051
Sure.

77
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,348
Thanks.

78
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,185
once again apologies, Mr. Ali.

79
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,963
Percy.

80
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,031
I am sorry, Mr. Ali. - Well..

81
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,432
Clearly the donuts aren't helping,
are they?

82
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,733
Let's go.

83
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,641
Can't believe this.

84
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,079
Bloody morons!

85
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,479
I am going to put this on my channel.

86
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,609
And Twitter.

87
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,447
I am going to make
sure those guys are sacked.

88
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,245
How could they strip
you off your clothes?

89
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,084
And this is how they returned them.

90
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,680
They could've at least ironed your clothes?
- Sweetheart.

91
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,487
we were at the police station.
- So?

92
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,460
Not at the drycleaners?
- So.

93
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,758
We can't take you home like this?

94
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,662
We'll have to buy new clothes.

95
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,098
Let me check.

96
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,331
Listen, Asha,
I don't think we should do this today.

97
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,407
It's not a good sign.

98
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,342
What? - Meeting your parents
for the first time, what else?

99
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,603
My mom called,
they are already.. - Asha.

100
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,113
It's not a good day today.

101
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,113
I feel.. - Shut up and stop thinking.

102
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,309
How can I stop thinking?

103
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,648
Few minutes ago I was at the
police station without my clothes.

104
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,347
And now I am going
to meet your parents..

105
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,252
..regarding our marriage, and that
too meeting them for the first time.

106
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,350
Everything's happening
so quickly, Asha.

107
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,585
I haven't evolved from one shock..

108
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,219
..and another's
knocking at my doorstep.

109
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,558
Take my advice.

110
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,088
Let's do it some other day.
- Relax.

111
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,064
Nothing will happen.

112
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,329
That's what scares me.
What if nothing happens at all?

113
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,063
I mean, I really want
something to happen.

114
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,333
I want to like your family
and want them to accept me too.

115
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,738
We.. - Will you shut
up or should I make you?

116
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,636
You do it.

117
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:46,616
"You're like the dew drops."

118
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:51,714
"Like the morning rays."

119
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:58,361
"You make every season,
blossom li ke spring."

120
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:04,199
"Li ke words in a song."

121
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,537
"Narrating sweet melodies."

122
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:20,778
"When I blink,
I see you in front of me."

123
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:26,748
"Warm my cold breaths."

124
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,017
"Turn around, sweetheart."

125
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:34,226
"Your love means my entire world."

126
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:40,763
"You dwell in my soul."

127
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:47,338
"I am lost in your love."

128
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,778
"Turn around, sweetheart."

129
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:56,046
"I've witnessed God in you."

130
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:01,358
"Your grace is li ke devotion."

131
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:07,427
"You're the limits of my love."

132
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,485
Let it be.

133
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,683
No one's going to bite you.

134
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,347
Are you sure?

135
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,718
Sure.

136
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,326
okay.

137
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,657
What..

138
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,665
okay, no matter what happens..

139
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,761
..nothing's going
to change between us.

140
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,330
Promise?

141
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,667
Promise.

142
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,441
I love you.

143
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,077
I love you too.

144
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,108
Come.

145
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,021
You never told me anything
about your family.

146
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,251
It would've been easier if..

147
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,622
..you had told me
something about them.

148
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,320
You'll be meeting them.

149
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,721
Who's at home?
- Everyone.

150
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,666
You've to meet everyone, come on.

151
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,443
Mom, look Raj and Simran.

152
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,488
Very good, dear.

153
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,545
Die!

154
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,646
Very good, mom.

155
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,420
You aren't ready yet?

156
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,219
He isn't coming to see me.

157
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,417
Wow, nice!

158
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,996
You didn't cook all
this when it was my time.

159
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,554
Now don't say that
your husband left you..

160
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,328
..because, we didn't cook
all this during your time.

161
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,535
Sorry, dear.

162
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,072
You see, I've lost my mind.

163
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,108
I'm blabbering nonsense
because I'm worried.

164
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,676
No problem,
mom, I'm getting used to it now.

165
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,713
Don't mind.

166
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,447
Go and put something on.

167
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,040
And see where your brother is..
- Mom.

168
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,008
Hello. Yes.

169
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,281
What time's the class?

170
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,050
I know.
- Anjali, answer the door.

171
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,028
Hi, Anjali. - Who are you?

172
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,734
You didn't recognize me? - No?

173
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,407
You don't know me? - No.

174
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,642
Asha aunty.

175
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,980
Mom, Asha auntie's here.

176
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,074
Very good, dear. Let them in.

177
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,209
Let's go.

178
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,446
Hi..

179
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,025
What happened? - I am pregnant.

180
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,027
Pregnant?

181
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,530
Congratulations.

182
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,691
Is it a boy or a girl? - Both.

183
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,291
Have you thought of a name?

184
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,235
Raj and Simran.

185
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,005
okay.

186
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,067
This is Aman. - Hi.

187
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,611
Say hello. - No.

188
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,015
I've a sweet gift for her. - Yes.

189
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,715
Very, very,
nice and cute doll for you.

190
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,222
Wow. - Just li ke you.

191
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,088
So pretty. - Here you go.

192
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,596
oh, God!

193
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,665
Anjali.

194
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,474
Sorry. - No, it's okay.

195
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,570
She's a kid. What can we do?

196
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,282
I hope you like kids?

197
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,709
Yes, but not like her.

198
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,519
How will our children be?

199
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,392
They will be fine if they're like me.

200
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,991
They will be fine if they're like you?

201
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,260
Asha. - Coming, mom.

202
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,594
Come on. Mom.

203
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,137
Mom. - Asha.

204
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,498
My sweetheart.

205
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,669
Curse you, don't you get food to eat?

206
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,440
You've lost so much weight.

207
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,072
You look fine on the television.

208
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,709
Mom, this is why I look
fine on the television.

209
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,586
Why don't you visit us every weekend?

210
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,020
I yearn to see you. - Mom.

211
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,991
And anyway,
after you're married.. - Mom.

212
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,457
Aman. - Greetings.

213
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,430
Mom, you promised.

214
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,634
Thank you, son.

215
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,470
Your aunt had called,
the wretch was saying..

216
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,631
.."Why a Muslim boy".

217
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,971
I said "It's Asha's choice".

218
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,033
End of discussion.

219
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,975
Right, son.
Will you keep Asha happy?

220
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,306
Yes.

221
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,408
Speak louder, we are Punjabis.

222
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,975
Yes, yes, I'll keep her happy.

223
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,611
That's more like it.

224
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,586
Mom.

225
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,685
Mom. I am going to kill this guy.

226
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,192
This Pakistani's going
to die by my hands today.

227
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,186
Hey, sis. - Manav.

228
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,593
What's up?
- How are you?

229
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,632
It's been so long.
What have you don't to your hair?

230
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,192
They really love each other. - Yes.

231
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,600
Back in college, some boy teased Asha.

232
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,573
When Manav found out,
he thrashed him black and blue..

233
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,634
..and, spent the entire
night behind bars.

234
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,509
Why are you screaming?

235
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,673
That Pakistani who lives
in the flat right below us.

236
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,151
He parked his car in my
space again and disappeared.

237
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,184
That's how these Pakistanis are.

238
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,452
They always park in the wrong place.

239
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,422
Manav, Aman.

240
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,190
Hey. Manav.

241
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,521
Mom. Where's my hockey?

242
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,998
It's in your room along
with your baseball bats.

243
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,694
But not today, son.
We've guests at home.

244
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,699
I know, I'll cut
their cable connection.

245
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,235
He won't listen.

246
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,543
These Pakistanis won't
stop making trouble.

247
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,650
Go and meet grandpa.

248
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,015
He's been asking since morning..

249
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,314
.."Where's Asha,
when is she coming".

250
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,377
Go.

251
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,016
I'll just.

252
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,687
What?

253
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,162
What?

254
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,393
You didn't tell them
I am a Pakistani.

255
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,167
I told them you're a Muslim.

256
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,497
That means you didn't
tell them I am a Pakistani.

257
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,540
These guys hate Pakistanis.

258
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,075
Easy, I don't want them to judge you..

259
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,576
..on the fact that you're a Pakistani.

260
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,703
That's it. - Some Pakistani took his..

261
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,345
..parking space on the
fact that you're a Pakistani.

262
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,938
If I talk about you,
God knows what he'll..

263
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:04,949
Relax.

264
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,073
What relax?

265
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,617
And who named him Manav?

266
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,019
Daddy did.
Aman, you're over-reacting.

267
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,024
I am not...over-reacting.

268
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,524
This is not about Hindu-Muslim..

269
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,653
It's about India and Pakistan.

270
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,591
Will you shut up or should I make you?

271
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,398
You do it.

272
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,471
Nothing's going to happen.
- I believe that too.

273
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,608
Nothing's going to happen.

274
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,036
You're laughing? - okay, I'll
speak to them myself, don't worry.

275
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,677
Please take your own
sweet time and start...

276
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,548
Start with your mother.

277
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,111
And if possible, tell Manav
over the phone a day or two later.

278
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,447
What.. - Don't laugh.

279
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,114
okay. Let's go meet grandpa.

280
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,556
Speak louder, he's hard of hearing.

281
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,460
of course he's hard of hearing.
He's Punjabi after all.

282
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,390
Not just that,
he's actually hard of hearing.

283
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,457
Come on.

284
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,394
Confidence.

285
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,975
Grandpa.

286
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,942
Asha.

287
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,348
How are you?
- My dear..

288
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,510
I am fine. - Guess who's here?

289
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,484
Guess who's here? - Who?

290
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,953
Guess? - Who?

291
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,457
Is he a boy or a girl?

292
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,687
Grandpa, he's a boy.

293
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,957
He seems frightened.

294
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,230
Because he just met Manav. - I see.

295
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,096
How old are you? - 28.

296
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,675
28! - What do you do?

297
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,443
I play the guitar.

298
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,979
Son, even I play the guitar.

299
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,979
But what do you do?

300
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,614
I.. I mean..

301
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,283
Aman is a musician, grandpa.
- Musician.

302
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,216
I see, no wonder..

303
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,989
You should exercise, son. - Yes.

304
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,052
Look here.

305
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,222
Made in 1930.

306
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:04,227
In the 1971 war,
I was shot here and here.

307
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,403
Still, I didn't desert post.

308
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,264
13 days war with Pakistan.

309
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,773
We defeated them.

310
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,273
Why didn't you join the army?

311
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,716
Even if I did, I couldn't
have fought against Pakistan.

312
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,081
Why?

313
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,178
There are no more wars, grandpa.

314
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,085
There will be, dear.

315
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,747
There will be a war.

316
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,218
"There will be!"

317
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,452
Tell him.

318
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,026
You said he's hard of hearing.

319
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,791
Lee Enfield Mark 4.

320
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,664
British infantry rifle.

321
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,471
I killed 4 Pakistanis with this.

322
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,736
The 5th shot me.

323
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,453
Anjali, what are you doing here?

324
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,488
Father, didn't I
tell you not to do it.

325
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,261
Let go of these bullets
and take these pills.

326
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,430
Why are you crying?

327
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,494
Everyone's lost their mind.
Pointing guns at children.

328
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,266
No, no..

329
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,000
Don't cry.

330
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,008
Sorry, mom, I didn't see.
- It's okay, dear.

331
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,512
Anjali, stop crying.

332
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,014
Jia, stop screaming.

333
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,780
What do you want, dear? - Band-aid.

334
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,782
Why?

335
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,488
Raj and Simran are hurt.

336
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,252
You and your Raj-Simran.

337
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,089
Come, I'll take a look.
Come on, dear.

338
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,621
Come on. Come on.

339
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,663
Come on. Come on.

340
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,099
Come on.

341
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,734
Come on.

342
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,040
We'll give you a band-aid.

343
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,504
Come on, dear.

344
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,768
Come.

345
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,740
Sit here. Sit.

346
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,816
Sit comfortably.

347
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,052
Here you go, band-aid.

348
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,691
What's this, mom?

349
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,534
Anti-depressants.

350
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,432
Anti-depressants? Why?

351
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,331
The doctor has prescribed them, dear.

352
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:23,033
He says it's best for sadness.

353
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,602
Sadness?

354
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,545
Dear, I went to see the doctor.

355
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,039
I couldn't say anything.

356
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,416
He looked at me for a while..

357
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,476
..and then prescribed
a medicine for me.

358
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,514
What kind of a doctor is he?
- He's Indian.

359
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,418
But, what are you
depressed about, mom?

360
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,423
About what?

361
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,222
Have you seen your sister?

362
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,760
Have you seen your brother?

363
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,229
Your grandma.

364
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,327
Anjali.

365
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,099
Have you seen your father?

366
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,730
No. Where's dad?

367
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,638
At the office, where else?

368
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,038
He's been demoted, dear.

369
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,679
The car just got smaller.

370
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,677
He knows his future
son-in-law's coming home.

371
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,085
But he can come home
only when his boss lets him.

372
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,712
And you know your brother
really well.

373
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,684
I don't know when he's
ever going to change?

374
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,318
And your sister.

375
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,018
She's a 5 year old daughter..

376
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,290
..but she isn't responsible.

377
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,022
She doesn't want to
apologies to her husband..

378
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,590
..and go back home.

379
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,726
Why don't you explain her?

380
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,038
Isn't her dance school doing well?

381
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,197
That's the problem.

382
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,002
I can't figure out the
kind of friends she's made.

383
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,030
They come home too.

384
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,008
They look like goons.

385
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,706
Why did you gesture at Aman?

386
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,417
No, I didn't mean that.

387
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,716
I hope you don't feel
that we're a crazy family.

388
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,454
No, I don't feel that at all.

389
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,653
Why are you holding that?
Give it to me.

390
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,264
Who else do you have in your family?

391
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,630
I have a father, mother..

392
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,366
.three brothers, four sisters..

393
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,701
..and by grace of God, myself.

394
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,308
And where in India do you hail from?

395
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:09,741
What?

396
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,310
India.

397
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,581
I..
- Mom, he's a Pakistani.

398
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,182
Who?
- Me!

399
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:33,663
"Hail Goddess."

400
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,103
"All say, hail Goddess."

401
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,437
"Everyone say, hai I Goddess."

402
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,701
"Hai I Goddess."

403
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,237
"All say, hai I Goddess."

404
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,013
"Goddess, You're our only refuge."

405
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,241
"Hai I Goddess."

406
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,282
"All say, hai I Goddess."

407
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,408
Mom, say something.

408
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,417
What do I say?

409
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,051
You two have lost your mind?

410
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,425
You two have gone crazy? - Why?

411
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,396
Why?

412
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,293
Ashaa, up till Muslim was fine.

413
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:04,562
But Pakistani?

414
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,193
Asha, couldn't you find an Indian.

415
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,563
Indians kill Pakistanis
and Pakistanis kill Indians.

416
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,007
We aren't doing anything like that.
- Not yet.

417
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,170
But you will do it later.

418
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,215
This will never work, dear.
- But it's working out.

419
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,614
Because it's all new.

420
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,982
Later you will strangle each other.

421
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,353
Have you thought about your children?

422
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,682
We have.

423
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,986
Aman wants a daughter..

424
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,391
..and we will call her Shanti.

425
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,563
That won't bring any
peace in your family.

426
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,292
Have you seen Manav?

427
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,492
I named him Manav (Human)..

428
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,558
..but, he's turned into a cannibal.

429
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,994
The beans are cooked.

430
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,333
Jia!

431
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,267
I'll take care of it.
- I'll come too.

432
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,433
You wait.

433
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,703
Switch off the gas.

434
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,473
And, there's soup in the freezer,
keep it to defrost.

435
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,741
Yes, I'll do it.

436
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,380
See you. - See you.

437
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,151
Mom, we love each other.

438
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,414
To hell with your love.

439
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:00,151
After 1947, there can be
no love between India and Pakistan.

440
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,487
It all ended right there.

441
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,491
Mom.

442
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,446
Can't even walk,
but likes to play with a knife.

443
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,422
Where's the soup?

444
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,533
Is this soup or brick?

445
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,556
I asked her to postpone
the meeting today.

446
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,564
Today is not a good day.

447
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,396
But 'No', we've too meet them today.

448
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,630
As if it's the end of the world.

449
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,331
I wish I hadn't listened to her.

450
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:25,103
The family's filled with fools.

451
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:29,042
And now this is acting
stubborn as well.

452
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:32,978
Hi.

453
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,283
What are you laughing at?

454
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,560
Who are you?

455
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,656
I came here with Asha.

456
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,596
Asha's boyfriend.

457
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,429
Yes.

458
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,572
open your mouth. - What?

459
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,467
Pakistani?

460
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,006
How did you know?

461
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:40,042
Well.. - Mom,
can I please have some juice?

462
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,192
Here you go.

463
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,387
Never ever say please. - Why?

464
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:57,094
Because...people will
think you're a moron.

465
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,364
Alright, listen this is the last..

466
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,598
No more juice.

467
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:06,700
Who is it?

468
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:07,945
Aman. Aman.

469
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,544
Aman? Who?

470
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,409
Aman, guitarist.

471
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,449
The one who can't join the army, and..

472
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,315
..even if he could, he couldn't
fight against the Pakistanis.

473
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,444
I see.

474
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,647
Listen to this joke. - No.

475
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,519
Son, listen to this joke.

476
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,116
A patient goes to the doctor.

477
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,287
He asks, "Doctor, how long do I have".

478
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,022
The doctor says "10".

479
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,427
The patient asks, "10 what".

480
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,663
"Years, months, weeks, days."

481
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:39,570
The doctor says "Ten,
nine, eight, seven, six..".

482
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,208
Wasn't that funny?

483
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,583
It was a funny joke.

484
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,517
Where are you going?

485
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,280
Rascal, now try driving your car.

486
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,015
oh, God!

487
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,113
And you two will live
in Karachi after the marriage.

488
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,641
No, mom. London.

489
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,051
Your children will be Muslim, dear.

490
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,453
They won't be, mom.

491
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,354
We've thought that,
our children will decide..

492
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,187
..which religion
they want to practice.

493
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,228
There will be no problem.
- There's no problem yet.

494
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,763
But when he gets a second,
third and fourth wife..

495
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,989
.then you'll think
that your mother was right.

496
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,058
Mom, Aman believes in Monogamy.

497
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,466
What "Gamy"?

498
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,536
He won't perform anymore marriages.

499
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,335
But you will change
your religion, dear.

500
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,070
I won't.

501
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,509
And you will even change
your name after the marriage.

502
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,343
No, mom, I won't.

503
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,541
And Aman's totally cool with it.

504
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,517
Come to your senses.
- What senses?

505
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,450
What are you..
- Asha!

506
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,282
Hey.. Hi!

507
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,250
Why were you screaming?
- I wasn't screaming.

508
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,053
Mom was screaming
because Aman's..

509
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,222
A Pakistani.

510
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,558
You knew.

511
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,634
I just met him outside.
- How did you find out?

512
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,365
I did, as soon as
he opened his mouth.

513
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:09,721
Aman.

514
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,226
Aman.

515
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,719
Aman.

516
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,499
Grandpa, have you seen Aman?

517
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,693
Aman, who?
- Aman.

518
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,300
The one who came with me.

519
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,497
Have you seen him?
- Him?

520
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,505
Yes.

521
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:27,042
I told him a joke,
and he ran away after hearing it.

522
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,001
Ran away.
- Yes.

523
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,639
Where?
- outside.

524
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,577
oh no.

525
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,581
Who ran away?

526
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,708
Aman ran away.

527
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,549
Why?

528
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,054
Don't you know why?

529
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,454
All of you ganged up on him. Why
did I come here in the first place?

530
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,085
I shouldn't have..
- No, dear, you shouldn't say that.

531
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,220
Mom, I wanted Aman to meet my family.

532
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,793
But the truth of the matter is..

533
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,022
..my family is not worth
being introduced to anyone.

534
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,590
No, dear, we aren't useless..

535
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,034
..he's a Pakistani.
Try to understand.

536
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,795
Just..

537
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,539
Dear.

538
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,376
Hello. - Aman.

539
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,009
Asha, there's been a problem.

540
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:07,708
Is it Aman?

541
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,510
Give me, I'll apologies.
- Hold on.

542
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,612
Listen, the soup container
slipped out of my hands..

543
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,418
..fell out the window
and landed on someone's head..

544
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,391
..and, I think he's dead.

545
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,154
What are you saying?

546
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,155
Give me, I'll apologies.

547
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,629
Hello, Amam. This is aunty speaking.

548
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,999
Sorry, son. I over-reacted.

549
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,732
It's okay if you're a Pakistani.

550
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,400
Asha and you came
to give us good news..

551
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,637
..and we ruined your surprise.

552
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,271
Sorry, son. Come up.

553
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,215
Don't come up, I am coming down.

554
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,217
Yes, okay. - Shall I come too?

555
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,319
Mom, you just wait here.
I'll get him.

556
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,421
See...she's chosen a Pakistani.

557
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,720
Unbelievable.

558
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,065
Aman. - Asha.

559
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,500
I thought you ran away.

560
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,097
Where's the soup? - Soup?

561
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,675
The soup and the man
are lying right there.

562
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,412
Listen, I'll call the ambulance.

563
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,504
Don't call from your phone..

564
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,570
..Iet's call from the booth across.

565
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,741
Why are we scared?

566
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,175
Do you want to be arrested?

567
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,184
Why will I be arrested?

568
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,323
Yes, mom.
- Asha, are you two coming?

569
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,459
Yes, mom, we're coming.

570
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,085
Aman's coming too.

571
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,292
Yes, aunty, I am coming.

572
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,197
Bless you, son.
- okay, mom, bye.

573
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,562
Come on.
- Why wi ll I be arrested?

574
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,069
It was an accident.

575
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,728
You're a Pakistani,
have you forgotten?

576
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,372
If anything happens to him,
you'll be arrested, Aman.

577
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,070
Your life will be ruined.
-And what about his life?

578
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,003
I guess he's..

579
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,138
And maybe not.

580
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,248
The ambulance is coming
and would take care of him.

581
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,480
Come on.
- This isn't right.

582
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,353
You.. - We don't have an option, Aman.

583
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,789
Please don't think too much.

584
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,721
If anyone asks, tell them..

585
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,318
..you came down to have a smoke.

586
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,391
But I don't smoke.

587
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,097
At least you can lie.

588
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,994
Very less.
But, whenever I do my ears turn red.

589
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:07,969
I..

590
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,305
Don't say anything.

591
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,141
Go get the container,
until then I'll call the ambulance.

592
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,201
Where is it?

593
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,011
Father, have you
seen the soup container?

594
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,348
What soup?

595
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,361
The soup.

596
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,428
You ran away with the soup. - Mom.

597
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,063
Sorry, dear.

598
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,733
Take it. - No, it's for you.

599
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,570
Take it. - No, you keep it.

600
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,503
Sorry, son.

601
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,073
Sorry, son.

602
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,476
Come in. Come.

603
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,050
Come on.

604
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,616
How much is this one for?

605
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,024
69.95, sir.

606
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,435
And that one? - That is 59.95.

607
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:59,176
And.. - 49.95, sir.

608
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,432
For a man who doesn't
want to spend any money.

609
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,602
These are free.

610
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,204
Free delivery?

611
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,713
I know, I have been telling you..

612
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:35,714
Hi.

613
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,255
Do it again. Do it again.

614
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,349
Do what again?

615
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,417
Do it again. Do it again.

616
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,129
Anjali, behave yourself.

617
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,189
Again. Again. Again. Again.

618
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,263
Do it again.

619
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,670
Do what?

620
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,470
Nothing,
I showed her a small magic trick.

621
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,406
Anjali, straight to
bed after the magic trick.

622
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,414
Promise? - Promise.

623
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,709
Do it! Do it! Do it!

624
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:33,304
""Baby Shirin.. Baby shirin..""

625
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,091
Throw it out of the window!

626
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,691
Throw it out of the window!

627
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,493
Throw it out of the window!

628
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,371
Will you come with me for a second?

629
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,337
Come on.

630
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,013
Listen.

631
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,642
I know a trick as well.

632
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:15,941
Watch.

633
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,980
Yes. Look here.

634
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,116
one

635
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,024
two

636
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,591
three..

637
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,557
Why didn't you tell me, that..

638
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,498
..Anjali saw you dropped the soup.
- I forgot.

639
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,537
And where did you learn
this stupid magic trick?

640
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,539
What am I stuck in?

641
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,345
okay, I am sorry I said that.

642
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,081
Why hasn't the ambulance arrived yet?

643
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,476
How do you know it hasn't?

644
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,043
Hello. Ambulance, siren.

645
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,714
It's been just 5 minutes,
it will be here.

646
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,422
Did you call them? - of course.

647
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,685
Swear it. - Swear what?

648
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,283
Swear that you called the ambulance.

649
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,986
You think I am lying.

650
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,524
What kind of a person you think I am?

651
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,121
I know what kind of a person you are.

652
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,428
I don't even know what
kind of a person I am.

653
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,092
You're the idiot that..

654
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,000
.throws a frozen
soup out of the window.

655
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,036
Say it. Say whatever you like.

656
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,734
You can all call me whatever you like.

657
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:12,998
I am alone after all.

658
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,641
Aman, why are we fighting
amongst ourselves.

659
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,203
I am sorry.

660
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,411
I just came to meet you.

661
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,212
And because you insisted.

662
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,377
I told you it's not a good day today.

663
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,013
Let's not meet today.
"No, let's meet today."

664
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,717
Since I arrived someone's
throwing an orange..

665
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,418
..or shooting a bullet,
or abusing me..

666
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,017
..or threatening me..
- Will you shut up or should I do it?

667
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,529
I don't know what you should do,
or what should I do?

668
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:34,656
What is all this?

669
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,437
I think that man's dead.

670
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,436
No, it was an accident.

671
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,444
It would've happened by someone else.

672
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,347
What are you saying? -Destiny.

673
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,813
Remember. - Asha.

674
00:40:58,422 --> 00:40:59,650
Coming, mom.

675
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,020
Just relax.

676
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,218
Calm down. Calm down.

677
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,254
Relax.

678
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,158
Forget it.

679
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,992
Four,

680
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,365
three,

681
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,488
Two,

682
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,090
one.

683
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,538
How was it?
- I want an Ultrasum..

684
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,334
okay, dear,
first thing in the morning.

685
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,668
Come here.

686
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,140
No one's pregnant.

687
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,337
Mom, please. - Be quiet.

688
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,513
You're not pregnant.
- Mom, don't scream.

689
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,778
Raj and Simran are getting hurt.
- You're not pregnant.

690
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,485
Mom, help.
- Pregnant! Pregnant!

691
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,613
Both mother and daughter
are driving me mad.

692
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,419
Let go.

693
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,787
Pregnant.

694
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,789
Let it be, mom, she's a kid.

695
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,588
Kid? Let her play kiddies' game.

696
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,689
What's this? Raj-Simran.

697
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,360
Look here.

698
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,131
It's just a cushion.
There is no Raj-Simran.

699
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,331
You are not pregnant.

700
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,439
You've driving me crazy.
- No, no, no.

701
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,805
Yes.

702
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,077
Are you happy now?

703
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,772
You ruined her game.

704
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,538
Was this a game?

705
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,614
5 year old child, pregnant.

706
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,711
Jia. - Mom. - Foolish girl.

707
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,286
Raj-Simran.

708
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,715
Where are you going now?

709
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,517
Nowhere, I am right here.

710
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:12,585
Come with me to the kitchen.

711
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,495
See, she isn't depressed..

712
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,466
..she's getting crazier by the day.

713
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,266
This is why dad's having an affair.

714
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,470
Dad's having an affair?

715
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,508
of course.

716
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,042
How do you know?

717
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,279
He arrives after we fall asleep.

718
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,341
Leaves before we get up.

719
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,047
What else would you call it?

720
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,683
Good night.
- Good night.

721
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,612
Why don't you go back home?

722
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,525
I will once he comes to take me back.

723
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,210
What was the problem, Jia?

724
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,146
Problem.

725
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,685
Sanjay thought I
squandered lots of money.

726
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,253
But I feel he earns less.

727
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,258
Bloody miser.

728
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,494
But, why did you two have an argument?

729
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,332
I sort of used his credit cards?

730
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,403
Used?

731
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,698
or abused?

732
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:33,736
Abused.

733
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,013
I knew it.

734
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,482
okay, okay.

735
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,556
It feels so nice,
doesn't it? - What?

736
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:56,358
I always wanted Asha
to help me in the kitchen.

737
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,101
My dreams have finally
come true today.

738
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:00,965
Thank you.

739
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,109
They drive me nuts.

740
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:16,645
Mom.

741
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,550
Yes.

742
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,114
Mom, isn't this music..

743
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,988
..coming from that Pakistani's house?
- No, son.

744
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,560
Maybe it's from somewhere..
- No, mom.

745
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,994
I'm telling you,
it's coming from there.

746
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,759
He'll die.
That Pakistani's going to die today.

747
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,560
You shouldn't say that, son.
- I'll go set him straight right now.

748
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,604
Pakistani, you're going to die today.

749
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,696
Don't mind son.

750
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,035
Pakistani.

751
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,338
This has become a daily
habit with him. - Manav.

752
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:40,641
Manav.

753
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,137
Wait. Wait.

754
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,744
Manav.

755
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,746
Curse you.

756
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,183
His stupidity never ends.

757
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,030
Where are you sticking your hands?

758
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,230
Wallet?

759
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,700
He's taking his wallent.

760
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,975
oh no.

761
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,103
Hey!

762
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,650
Hey idiot, fraud!

763
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,417
Aman.

764
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,090
Why were you jumping out?
- I wasn't.

765
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,597
Then what were you doing?

766
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,434
Just getting some fresh air,
I was feeling stuffy.

767
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,130
Is this what you
do when you feel stuffy?

768
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,470
We do..

769
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,086
Yes? - Yes!

770
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,415
Put it on mute.

771
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,016
I will..

772
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,291
What happened?

773
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:08,960
Happened?

774
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,194
What happened?

775
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,101
I mean what's going to happen.

776
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,365
Nothing happened.

777
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,999
We'll talk later, okay bye.

778
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,466
Where did he get him from?

779
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,997
What happened, son?

780
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:56,071
I explained him. - Then,
why didn't he turn off the music.

781
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,012
Because I told him not to.

782
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,975
I gave him a list of my songs.

783
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,046
Here, drink some soup.

784
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,080
You have some too, son.

785
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,454
Mom, Aman's not feeling too well.

786
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:11,722
Already?

787
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:12,986
What happened?

788
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,095
He's got fever,
I guess he's caught a cold.

789
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,268
I see, let me take a look.

790
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,562
Come here.

791
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,403
He's fine.

792
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:25,998
A while ago he was
feeling stuffy.

793
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,101
Have some soup, son.
You will feel better.

794
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,703
Mom. - Let him taste it.

795
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,608
I've been in the
kitchen since morning.

796
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,312
Missed all three serials.

797
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,183
There's nothing wrong if he tastes it.

798
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,244
Come on, son.

799
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:57,564
Nice?

800
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,765
See, didn't I say you will like it.

801
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,409
Have some more, son.

802
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,208
Mom. - It's good for fever.

803
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,976
It increases blood-count.

804
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,984
Don't drink if you don't want to.

805
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,213
No need to listen to her.

806
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,570
It feels so nice, we're all together.

807
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,269
Jia, what's that saying?

808
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,648
A family that eats
together stays together.

809
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,183
Very nice saying.

810
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,382
Would've felt better
if your daddy was here, right?

811
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,181
Did you have your wine?

812
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:54,322
The doctor's said
it's good for her heart.

813
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,193
What kind of a sister is she..

814
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:28,956
What's this on my shoe?

815
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,232
It's blood.

816
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,009
one second.

817
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,373
Trouble.

818
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,716
one second please.

819
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,716
Would you like a
brush and polish, son?

820
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,559
No, they are shining now.

821
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,131
Grandma.

822
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,699
Grandma,

823
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,005
Grandma,

824
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,773
aunt, mom..

825
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,291
Asha.

826
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,123
Asha!

827
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,663
Asha!

828
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,414
Asha!

829
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,482
Asha!

830
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:12,151
What happened, Manav?

831
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:13,553
I don't know.

832
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,428
There's an ambulance and a police car.

833
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,430
What are you going to shine now?

834
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:23,563
Loo. Toilet.

835
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:29,178
Asha. You cannot marry him.

836
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:30,778
Mom, don't start again.

837
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,474
I am not saying this
because he's a Pakistani..

838
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,280
..I'm saying it because he's crazy.

839
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:37,376
Who's Pakistani?

840
00:52:37,453 --> 00:52:39,751
What crazy? - Not more than us.

841
00:52:39,822 --> 00:52:41,221
of course he's mad.

842
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:43,282
Sometimes he feels stuffy,
sometimes cold.

843
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,520
He gets up in the
middle of a conversation.

844
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,496
We're right here,
and he ducks under the table.

845
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,260
He's mad.

846
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,560
He's nervous, mom.

847
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:54,228
No he's not, he's crazy.

848
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,267
He's not.
- He is.

849
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,738
He's completely crazy.

850
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,401
Believe me. You don't see it now,
but you wi ll later.

851
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,939
He sits to eat, and suddenly gets up..

852
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,611
.to polish his shoes.

853
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,305
Mom, Aman is a musician.

854
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:40,905
That's why he's sometimes
lost in his thoughts.

855
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,447
No, dear, he has completely lost it.

856
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:44,917
He's a gone case.

857
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,518
Let him go, dear.

858
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:47,851
Mom, there's something between us.

859
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,222
Yes, dear, we call that a problem.

860
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,787
Take my advice, I don't like this man.

861
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,441
What's in this?

862
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:18,210
Let's see.

863
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:25,625
Show me. Show me.

864
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:42,538
Grandpa. No. No. No.

865
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,887
""My sweet little angel.""

866
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:02,859
""Come to me slowly."

867
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:22,580
Where is he now? - Bathroom.

868
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,914
How do you know?

869
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,454
He said so.

870
00:55:25,521 --> 00:55:26,749
He lied.

871
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:28,789
The food's become cold.

872
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,486
Yes, he's been gone for a long time.

873
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,232
Curses, did he run away again?

874
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,834
oh my..

875
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,941
oh, God!

876
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,243
No..

877
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,519
Mom, come here..

878
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:11,891
Where are we and where will we go?

879
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:17,730
I wonder what he did
to father at this age.

880
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:19,297
You talk nonsense, mom.

881
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,605
Do you know how lonely
father has been?

882
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,409
I wonder what..- Enough! I've had it.

883
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:25,779
We're leaving.

884
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:27,873
What else will you
call him if not crazy?

885
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,412
Just think, why will anyone..

886
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:31,817
..go to the bathroom with father?

887
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,880
Why? - Speak softly.

888
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:36,848
Who was mom calling Pakistani?

889
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,188
Have you ever thought about it?

890
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,694
Sister.
- He's a Pakistani.

891
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:41,525
He's crazy
- Gone case.

892
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:43,822
Think, dear. Think.

893
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,425
You're ruining your future.

894
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,799
oh, God! Where do I go? What do I do?

895
00:56:49,872 --> 00:56:51,533
Listen, Asha.

896
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:52,665
Asha.

897
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:54,836
Asha.

898
00:56:57,346 --> 00:56:59,280
I'll send you an invitation,
don't bother to come.

899
00:56:59,782 --> 00:57:00,714
What happened?

900
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,652
Aman was with father in the bathroom..

901
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,516
This marriage will never work.

902
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:08,352
Stop thinking about mine,
and handle your marriage.

903
00:57:08,624 --> 00:57:10,421
What's wrong with my marriage?

904
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,190
Nothing. - Dad's affair
is absolutely normal.

905
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:15,127
You know what, Asha..

906
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,132
.this is the last
time I tell you anything.

907
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:18,633
What nonsense?

908
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,393
What do you two know? - Nothing.

909
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,233
He comes after you fall asleep.

910
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,704
Leaves before you get up.

911
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,206
The car's bound to get small.

912
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:26,832
After all,
he has to look after two families.

913
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,408
This stupid lift.

914
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:39,312
Excuse me. May I..

915
00:57:46,462 --> 00:57:48,692
I have to call your dad..

916
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:50,763
Honestly..

917
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,402
Asha.

918
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,496
Asha, wait.

919
00:57:56,772 --> 00:57:59,502
Asha, I think he's your dad. - Who?

920
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,269
The man who go hit by the soup..

921
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,335
..I think he's your dad,
I mean he was.

922
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:06,848
He is. - You said some
stranger got hit by it.

923
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,311
Yes, but I hadn't
seen your dad before?

924
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,147
So, how can you be
sure now that it's my dad?

925
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,188
I saw his picture upstairs.

926
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,383
He's bald head looks exactly similar.

927
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:17,720
Describe his face.

928
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,328
I saw him from the back, Asha.

929
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,824
Was he tall, stout, short, skinny..

930
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,730
He looked average.

931
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,336
That can't be my dad. - Why?

932
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:30,637
My dad would either be at
the office or with his girlfriend.

933
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,810
But maybe he was
coming home to meet me.

934
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:44,680
oh my, God!

935
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,619
Come on.

936
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:26,258
Dad..

937
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,497
Dad..

938
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:31,500
Asha.

939
00:59:36,138 --> 00:59:38,163
Come to your senses. Come on.

940
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:40,633
Sit.

941
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:44,576
That can't be dad. - Possible.

942
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,408
What's possi ble?
- That he wasn't your dad.

943
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,812
Dad wanted me to settle down.

944
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,383
Get married.

945
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,357
Have children.

946
00:59:57,426 --> 00:59:59,690
They will never get
to see their grandpa.

947
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:01,426
Who?

948
01:00:03,265 --> 01:00:04,493
our children.

949
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,291
our children!

950
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:12,472
Asha, maybe that wasn't the
grandpa of our future children.

951
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:16,134
Maybe, like you said,
he's at his office..

952
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,203
..or with his girlfriend.

953
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:20,875
There's no dearth
of bald men in this city.

954
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:25,719
Yes, dad always kept his ID along.

955
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,450
If that was dad, we would've
received a call by now. - Yes.

956
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,158
No. - Why not?

957
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,188
Some woman stole his purse.

958
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,528
Some woman stole his purse?

959
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,762
Yes, I saw it from the window.

960
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,162
Some woman stole his purse.

961
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,263
Why didn't you do something?

962
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,240
What could I do? I was about to
leap out of the window and catch her..

963
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:47,673
..when your mother caught hold of me.

964
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,732
Asha..

965
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,172
Where are you two going?

966
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,149
Why? Do you want a lift?

967
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:56,411
Dad's office.

968
01:00:56,852 --> 01:00:58,183
Did you talk to him?

969
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,279
No. No one's answering
at the switch-board..

970
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,551
..and dad forgot his phone at home.

971
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:03,556
We're coming too.

972
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:05,219
Come on.
- Really?

973
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,158
Yes.

974
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:41,697
"Life is filled with complications."

975
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:48,192
""The paths are unknown."

976
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:54,708
""The one that was my
companion till now.."

977
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:55,835
No thanks.

978
01:01:55,911 --> 01:02:01,474
""I miss seeing him.""

979
01:02:03,819 --> 01:02:05,377
Mom, careful.

980
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:06,746
Yes, dear.

981
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,357
Mom.

982
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,713
These Pakistani songs.

983
01:02:36,218 --> 01:02:37,378
Miser brother-in-law.

984
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:39,182
He's giving missed call.

985
01:02:43,225 --> 01:02:44,317
Manav.

986
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,927
Hi, brother-in-law, what's up?

987
01:02:46,228 --> 01:02:47,786
I've sent something for Jia.

988
01:02:47,863 --> 01:02:49,490
Was it delivered? - No.

989
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,960
Give the phone to Jia.

990
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,459
No one's at home.

991
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,696
Everyone's gone out to look for dad..

992
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,237
..along with that boy.

993
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,294
What boy?

994
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,608
The same boy sister's going to marry.

995
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:00,767
Marry?

996
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,838
Manav, what do you mean by marry..

997
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:04,840
Yes, hello..

998
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,348
Hello, brother-in-law. - Yes..

999
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,678
I can't hear a thing.

1000
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,411
These Pakistanis are driving me crazy.

1001
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,456
Can you hear the music? - Again?

1002
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:15,751
Yes, again.

1003
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,452
And there are three of them today.

1004
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,595
You wait, I am coming right now.

1005
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:24,394
Fine, I'll call Bunty
and Bablu as well. - okay.

1006
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,826
Brother-in-law.

1007
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,767
My old hockey stick's broken.

1008
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:30,468
So get me a new one..

1009
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:32,770
Hello. Hello.

1010
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,740
Hello, brother-in-law..

1011
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,405
Miser.

1012
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,478
These Pakistanis..

1013
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,872
Go home, Percy.

1014
01:04:14,216 --> 01:04:15,410
But, sir..

1015
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,644
..I've stumbled upon a terror plot.

1016
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,483
I'm going to bury you in a plot soon..

1017
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,921
..if you don't stop
uncovering these terror plots.

1018
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:25,360
But, sir, in the name of the queen..

1019
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,725
oh, shut up, Percy.

1020
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,731
We'll save Britannia
first thing tomorrow morning.

1021
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,712
Which floor? - I don't know.

1022
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:49,649
I don't know anything.

1023
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,616
I don't know whether
he works here or not.

1024
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,414
Maybe he also has children.

1025
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,184
What?
- Your siblings.

1026
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:59,194
Hi, there.
Mr. Rajinder Singh, sales department.

1027
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:01,561
Actually, it's his birthday.

1028
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:04,565
We're his family.
We just want to give him a surprise.

1029
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:06,762
Please.

1030
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:09,561
5th floor.

1031
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:10,764
Cheers.

1032
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,739
Madam. Madam.

1033
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:16,141
Can't park in front of the door.

1034
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,474
You guys go ahead,
I'll go park the car. - okay.

1035
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,612
Thanks. - Listen, mom.

1036
01:05:35,297 --> 01:05:36,195
Dad.

1037
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,202
Dad.

1038
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,838
It's all empty.
Is he inside? - He isn't here.

1039
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,910
Rajinder.

1040
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:51,277
Rajinder.

1041
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:53,643
Wait. Wait.

1042
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:55,340
Rajinder.

1043
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,217
Dad.

1044
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,362
Here's dad's desk.

1045
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,838
She's so beautiful. - Your, mom?

1046
01:06:19,908 --> 01:06:21,603
Rajinder's mom.

1047
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,666
What?

1048
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:00,508
It's someone else.

1049
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:04,276
We're looking for Rajinder Singh.

1050
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,587
He left.

1051
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,687
How long back?

1052
01:07:09,124 --> 01:07:10,682
A couple of hours.

1053
01:07:11,593 --> 01:07:12,753
How did he go?

1054
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:14,459
He left happily.

1055
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,324
Curse you two.

1056
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:17,556
Come on. - Let's go, mom.

1057
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,498
Raging hormones..

1058
01:07:22,137 --> 01:07:25,538
Well, I think he has
a concussion to the brain..

1059
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:27,802
..which means a loss of consciousness.

1060
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:30,868
Transient and prolonged
due to the blow to the head.

1061
01:07:31,146 --> 01:07:34,445
He has a weak pulse,
so there may be a chance of amnesia.

1062
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,447
Vertigo, nausea.

1063
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,619
He has slow respiration.

1064
01:07:38,787 --> 01:07:40,812
or it could be concussion
to the lamebrynth..

1065
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:43,414
..which would mean deafness,
swift tonituss

1066
01:07:43,525 --> 01:07:45,322
..due to the blow to the ear even.

1067
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,861
Not necessarily..

1068
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:28,528
What?

1069
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,688
Hello.

1070
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,789
Yeah, put the date of..

1071
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,766
We are just waiting for
the next report..

1072
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:23,248
Where did he go?

1073
01:09:23,358 --> 01:09:24,552
I don't know.

1074
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:27,560
Damn!

1075
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:36,668
It has been two hours since
and he hasn't reached home yet.

1076
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,800
You were right, dear.

1077
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:41,670
Mom.

1078
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:44,271
My mother used to say..

1079
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,711
..all men are the same.

1080
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:48,774
I never believed her.

1081
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:50,674
Rajinder was..

1082
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,552
But it's true.

1083
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:56,419
All men are the same.

1084
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:01,160
I think we should call the police.

1085
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:04,226
It's not wrong to have an affair, son.

1086
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,394
No, mom, Aman's right.

1087
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,571
We should call the police.
- Yes.

1088
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:10,570
Give me your phone.

1089
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,197
What? - Phone.

1090
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:15,142
I left my phone in the car.

1091
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,109
I'll get it.

1092
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,351
What's lacking in me, son? Tell me.

1093
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:31,658
I..

1094
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,388
No, say it son.

1095
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,458
Is there anything lacking in me?

1096
01:10:36,531 --> 01:10:38,795
There's nothing..

1097
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,226
Am I not beautiful? - No..

1098
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:44,500
Yes...I mean you're beautiful.

1099
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:48,134
You're very beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

1100
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,570
Would you cheat on a woman li ke me..

1101
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,737
..and have an affair
with someone else?

1102
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,210
You're Asha's mother.

1103
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:01,381
Forget that for a moment.
- It's difficult.

1104
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,091
Try, son.

1105
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:15,598
I would never leave you.

1106
01:11:18,106 --> 01:11:21,234
I would never go to work, and..

1107
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,568
.therefore this wouldn't
have happened..

1108
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:25,112
..if I wouldn't have gone
to work in the first place.

1109
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,521
The police says they
can't lodge a report..

1110
01:11:34,589 --> 01:11:35,783
..before 24 hours.

1111
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:38,459
Where are you going?

1112
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,256
To see Rajinder's drawer.

1113
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,128
Lord..

1114
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,237
Shameless.

1115
01:12:01,149 --> 01:12:02,673
Fooling around in the office.

1116
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,925
Who...who am I?

1117
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:20,660
Who am I?

1118
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,239
Where am I?

1119
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,621
Asha.

1120
01:12:45,193 --> 01:12:48,253
He's lost his mind.

1121
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:53,398
He even forgot that he's bald.

1122
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,569
Mom.

1123
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:18,188
Should I go right, or left?

1124
01:13:18,593 --> 01:13:20,356
He looks stoned.

1125
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:23,664
The way tonight's going,
I'll take anything.

1126
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,866
'What am I doing here?'

1127
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:28,595
He's not coming.

1128
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,194
Yes, he is.

1129
01:13:30,772 --> 01:13:32,899
'No, let's go back.'

1130
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,740
No.

1131
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:39,280
'Left. No straight.'

1132
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:40,637
Yes.

1133
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,612
No.

1134
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:48,586
Yes.

1135
01:13:49,524 --> 01:13:50,889
'I'll wait here.'

1136
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:52,855
What is up with him?

1137
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:55,195
Another psychopath.

1138
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,398
No, he's just shy.

1139
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,227
He needs his mummy.

1140
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:00,664
Yes. Because,
if they're not psychopaths..

1141
01:14:00,735 --> 01:14:02,225
.they are 5 year olds.

1142
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:06,474
Hi, come here love.

1143
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:09,642
What's the matter?

1144
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,303
Are you going to
stand there all night?

1145
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:13,243
Come, come, come, come.

1146
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,576
Come to mama?

1147
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:15,581
'Who is she?'

1148
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,646
Mama?

1149
01:14:20,388 --> 01:14:21,355
Mom.

1150
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,755
What happened to your head?

1151
01:14:29,764 --> 01:14:32,198
'How can she be mom?'

1152
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,659
I don't know.

1153
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,399
How much you got, love?

1154
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:42,537
'She's scolding me so gently.'

1155
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:46,711
I don't know what happened.

1156
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,608
Come. Come inside.

1157
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,580
I'll find something
to make you feel better.

1158
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,824
'She's taking me home.'

1159
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:05,196
I never thought Rajinder
would turn out like this.

1160
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:09,193
Why did I get married?

1161
01:15:09,804 --> 01:15:13,137
If you hadn't then
we wouldn't have been born.

1162
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,138
Rajinder makes me cry.

1163
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:17,802
All of you make me cry.

1164
01:15:18,246 --> 01:15:20,146
My life's total loss, dear.

1165
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,614
No, mom.

1166
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:25,681
Aman's a nice boy, dear.

1167
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,584
But all men are same.

1168
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,306
Tell me if it stings.

1169
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,280
'She's married.'

1170
01:15:56,217 --> 01:15:57,514
What happened?

1171
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,515
Did you get into a fight?

1172
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,757
'I am married too.'

1173
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,260
'Is she my wife..'

1174
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,659
What are you looking at?

1175
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:13,232
What do you think
I am going to do to you?

1176
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:15,332
Come, give me a hug.

1177
01:16:19,674 --> 01:16:21,471
'She's my wife.'

1178
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:24,369
That's it.

1179
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,341
That's the way I like it.

1180
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:30,483
'Thank God, I found my wife.'

1181
01:16:33,321 --> 01:16:36,620
'But...I married a foreigner.'

1182
01:16:41,162 --> 01:16:44,154
I don't know what happened?
- There, there.

1183
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,700
Don't worry, you're with me now.

1184
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:55,435
okay.

1185
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,840
Look. You're going to
have to give me some money.

1186
01:17:04,552 --> 01:17:05,883
How much do you need?

1187
01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:10,147
100 Pounds.

1188
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:12,754
100 Pounds?

1189
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,653
You got me scared.

1190
01:17:17,365 --> 01:17:19,424
Well, do you have them?

1191
01:17:21,736 --> 01:17:23,203
Do you want them now?

1192
01:17:23,638 --> 01:17:25,299
Yes, of course.

1193
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:27,375
Why?

1194
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:30,768
Why do you think?

1195
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,176
'My purse.'

1196
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:40,748
I don't have my wallet
right now with me.

1197
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:44,688
Where is it?

1198
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,418
I don't know.

1199
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:49,891
Are you playing?

1200
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,699
I told you what happened.

1201
01:17:54,602 --> 01:17:56,661
That's what I get for being so nice.

1202
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:58,763
I know, I must have..

1203
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:01,836
I must have left it somewhere.

1204
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,168
I will go and find it.

1205
01:18:03,244 --> 01:18:04,768
Well, go find it.

1206
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:09,142
Please don't get angry with me.
- Hey, don't touch me.

1207
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:13,677
Tell me, is something wrong?

1208
01:18:14,155 --> 01:18:16,521
Do we...do we have money problem?

1209
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:19,116
Yes, we have money problems.

1210
01:18:25,433 --> 01:18:27,264
I have my father's watch.

1211
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:30,395
You can sell it for now.

1212
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,130
Wait here.

1213
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:37,304
Everything will be fine.

1214
01:18:42,817 --> 01:18:45,285
Finished already.

1215
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:47,716
How much is this worth?

1216
01:18:48,556 --> 01:18:49,580
Well..

1217
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,220
Lap dance.

1218
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:54,787
I think.

1219
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,254
Enjoy.

1220
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,768
Did you find dad?

1221
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:10,206
No. - And these two?

1222
01:19:19,487 --> 01:19:21,250
I won't eat you.

1223
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,155
Can't say.

1224
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:27,127
You're my future brother-in-law.
- I see.

1225
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:30,627
So, what were you
doing under the table?

1226
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,699
I was just joking.

1227
01:19:33,768 --> 01:19:36,362
You guys are such stuck-ups.

1228
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:37,697
Us?

1229
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,467
You know what I mean.

1230
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:43,176
As if your liberty
got you to the moon.

1231
01:19:43,244 --> 01:19:45,405
You're sitting right
here in the corridor, with me.

1232
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:48,781
ouch!

1233
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,243
Anyway.

1234
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,247
Do you always drink?

1235
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,752
No.

1236
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,857
Drink it. Good for the heart.

1237
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,121
I've a fine heart.
- Go on. - No, no.

1238
01:20:04,165 --> 01:20:06,690
Take a sip.
- No, no. - Try, take a sip. - Fine.

1239
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:09,498
Good.

1240
01:20:10,371 --> 01:20:12,134
Considering all the
tensions I faced today..

1241
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,435
..I needed this. Thank you.

1242
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:14,440
Yes.

1243
01:20:16,744 --> 01:20:19,872
So...you guys are getting married.

1244
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,242
Yes.

1245
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:27,153
You don't look too happy.

1246
01:20:28,122 --> 01:20:29,350
No, no, I am happy.

1247
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:30,618
I am fine.

1248
01:20:32,193 --> 01:20:34,161
Really? - Yes.

1249
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:36,755
Doesn't look from your condition.

1250
01:20:37,131 --> 01:20:39,531
It doesn't? No, no, I..

1251
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:51,141
You know, Asha..

1252
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:56,277
Asha's so..
- over-powering.

1253
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,613
Yes.

1254
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,379
She always manages to persuade me.

1255
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:03,221
I mean I keep saying, but..

1256
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:05,851
..ultimately,
she makes me do what she wants.

1257
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:08,524
I was saying "Let's not go today,
let's not".

1258
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:10,587
But no "We have to, we have to".

1259
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:13,225
I said "The day
started on a bad note".

1260
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:14,768
"Let's not go today."
But no.

1261
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,696
I mean she's stubborn.

1262
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:22,573
Arguing with her is li ke..
- Getting *****

1263
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:23,872
Yes, getting *****. Exactly.

1264
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,770
Don't you abuse?

1265
01:21:29,817 --> 01:21:31,182
A little.

1266
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:37,784
Where is it?

1267
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:41,387
Jia.

1268
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:47,362
Your dad..

1269
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:49,300
Nothing will happen to dad.

1270
01:21:49,737 --> 01:21:52,262
Just watch, the doorbell
will ring tomorrow morning..

1271
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,632
..and he'll enter.

1272
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,175
So don't worry about it.

1273
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:57,910
There you are.

1274
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,185
You have this. That's my CD.

1275
01:22:05,586 --> 01:22:06,814
How do you have this?

1276
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:10,819
So you knew who I was.

1277
01:22:12,226 --> 01:22:14,421
Huge fan of your band.
- Really?

1278
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:18,155
Do you want to see something?

1279
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:19,626
Yes.

1280
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:31,441
Where's that boy?
- Which boy?

1281
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:33,742
The one that came
to see your sister.

1282
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:35,509
He's gone out with sister.

1283
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:37,750
So soon. - Yes.

1284
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:41,420
That's peculiar,
you aren't worried about sister..

1285
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,252
..but asking about the boy.

1286
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:44,723
Don't worry about them.

1287
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:46,586
Think about your own wife and kid.

1288
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:49,322
Aman and sis are made for each other.

1289
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,931
You fool. - Yes.

1290
01:22:51,265 --> 01:22:53,631
Which boy and which
sis are you talking about?

1291
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:55,802
Asha.

1292
01:22:56,637 --> 01:22:57,535
Come on.

1293
01:22:57,805 --> 01:22:59,534
Let's sc*** those Pakistanis.

1294
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,139
Where are Bunty and Bablu?

1295
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:10,880
There they are. - Greetings.

1296
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:16,149
Hello. - I found the wallet of...

1297
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:20,251
...Mr. Rajinder Singh.

1298
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,421
In it I found your number.

1299
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:26,860
If I return it will
you give 50 Pounds?

1300
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:28,929
Hello.

1301
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:32,167
He ate less,
and I thought he's worried.

1302
01:23:32,206 --> 01:23:34,299
He was actually on a diet.

1303
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:36,367
Come on. - Hello.

1304
01:24:03,771 --> 01:24:08,401
"I don't know the place I was."

1305
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:13,743
"The ambience was lost
in fun-frolic and dance."

1306
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:22,245
"I don't know the place I was."

1307
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:26,555
"The ambience was lost
in fun-frolic and dance."

1308
01:24:26,627 --> 01:24:29,152
"Everyone was laughing."

1309
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,392
"The walls were singing."

1310
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:33,661
"Bodies would sway, twist and turn.."

1311
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:35,895
"..in the place I was."

1312
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:40,470
"I don't know the place I was."

1313
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:45,808
"The ambience was lost
in fun-frolic and dance."

1314
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,735
"I was in an unknown world."

1315
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:17,209
"The ambiance was unique."

1316
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,337
"The ambiance was astonishing."

1317
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,607
"He was gorgeous."

1318
01:25:21,682 --> 01:25:23,809
"He was li ke a shining star."

1319
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:26,313
"Everyone...Iost their heart to him."

1320
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:30,790
"The place I was in
was better than heaven."

1321
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:35,454
"I don't know the place I was."

1322
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:39,899
"The ambience was lost
in fun-frolic and dance."

1323
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:44,571
"I don't know the place I was."

1324
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:49,440
"The ambience was lost
in fun-frolic and dance."

1325
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:54,777
"Everyone was laughing."

1326
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:57,249
"The walls were singing."

1327
01:25:57,318 --> 01:26:00,116
"Bodies would sway,
twist and turn.."

1328
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:01,620
"..in the place I was."

1329
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:05,887
"I don't know the place I was."

1330
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:10,393
"The ambience was lost
in fun-frolic and dance."

1331
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,364
Asha. - Hi.

1332
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,274
Sister is a fan.

1333
01:26:35,856 --> 01:26:38,689
'Why is my wife dancing like this?'

1334
01:26:40,861 --> 01:26:42,829
'But she's doing good.'

1335
01:26:58,312 --> 01:26:59,745
Hey.. - I've got a job for you.

1336
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:01,111
At least wait till I finish.

1337
01:27:01,148 --> 01:27:02,775
I am not running a charity.

1338
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:05,149
Who are you?

1339
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:06,450
Do you know him?

1340
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,817
And you do, old man.

1341
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:09,111
Get in.

1342
01:27:09,223 --> 01:27:10,622
Is he the person we owe money to?

1343
01:27:10,691 --> 01:27:12,591
Yes, but that's all taken care of now.

1344
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,423
So, you can get off
and find someone else..

1345
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:15,792
.to spank your monkey.

1346
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,259
Monkey?
What monkey?

1347
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:19,697
He's an idiot, or what?

1348
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:23,532
I am sorry, some other
customers are waiting for me.

1349
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,763
Come back tomorrow,
and we'll finish off, okay.

1350
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,129
What customers?

1351
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,368
Why tomorrow?

1352
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:29,272
What money?

1353
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:30,668
Why are you talking
to me like that?

1354
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:32,144
Because she's in business.

1355
01:27:32,246 --> 01:27:33,304
Business?

1356
01:27:33,914 --> 01:27:35,541
Take that back.
Take that back.

1357
01:27:35,616 --> 01:27:37,481
You want me to punch your face in?

1358
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:39,143
You can't insult my wife like that.

1359
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,653
Come on.
You're going to apologies to her.

1360
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,451
You're going to apologies to her.

1361
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,457
That's it.

1362
01:27:43,557 --> 01:27:44,751
Why is he coming here?

1363
01:27:45,192 --> 01:27:46,489
Apologies. Apologies. Come on.

1364
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,391
I am telling you, apologies to her.
- Just stop it.

1365
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:49,622
Don't leave me alone.

1366
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:50,891
What are you doing?

1367
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:52,689
You can't throw me out of my house.

1368
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:54,300
What are you doing?

1369
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:56,934
open the door.

1370
01:27:57,204 --> 01:27:58,728
oh my, God!

1371
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:01,400
open the door.
My house is going.

1372
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,538
My wife..

1373
01:28:04,278 --> 01:28:05,438
Stop him.

1374
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:07,606
Stop. Stop.
My house is going.

1375
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:09,206
My house is going.

1376
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:11,451
My wife. My wife.

1377
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:22,757
Asha. Asha.

1378
01:28:22,863 --> 01:28:24,330
Asha.
- Hello.

1379
01:28:24,398 --> 01:28:27,799
Mom, I am afraid.
- Where's Manav?

1380
01:28:27,868 --> 01:28:30,837
He's gone down with daddy.
- Why?

1381
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:33,870
Mom, grandpa's dead.

1382
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:35,165
What?

1383
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,404
What happened, dear?

1384
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:39,838
Anjali, listen.

1385
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:42,213
Stay right there, we'll be there.

1386
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:43,477
okay.

1387
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:45,542
What happened?
- What happened?

1388
01:28:47,621 --> 01:28:48,781
Grandpa's dead.

1389
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,714
What?

1390
01:29:01,802 --> 01:29:03,167
Excuse me.

1391
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:11,704
Sorry, sorry, sorry..
- Get out of my way.

1392
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:13,713
Put some clothes on.

1393
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:20,109
Excuse me, what time is it?
- Time.

1394
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,789
It's alright, never mind.

1395
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,723
'Where's dad's watch?'

1396
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:33,632
'She's the same girl..'

1397
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:43,809
'This girl's..'

1398
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,812
Everyone ready?
- Bravo.

1399
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:55,321
Come on. Go.

1400
01:29:55,389 --> 01:29:56,617
Go on.

1401
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:23,208
once more.
- Go, go, go.

1402
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:24,478
All the best, Manav.

1403
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:45,903
okay.Go.

1404
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:03,452
Run, run, run.

1405
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:08,260
You can't escape today.
- We'll get you today.

1406
01:31:09,363 --> 01:31:10,796
Get him.

1407
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:12,360
Pakistani, catch him.

1408
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,294
Today we'll..

1409
01:31:21,842 --> 01:31:24,276
Where are you going?
- Where do I go?

1410
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,870
They're coming.

1411
01:31:27,147 --> 01:31:28,444
Come down where?

1412
01:31:28,849 --> 01:31:32,148
He's coming down quickly.

1413
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,668
Indians!

1414
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:52,733
Stop!

1415
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,172
Stop!

1416
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,141
Hurry up.

1417
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:13,354
Who covered his face?

1418
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:15,492
I did.

1419
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:23,268
Are we going to bury him or burn him?

1420
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:49,728
Father's looking so calm.

1421
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,651
What are you doing, father?

1422
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:13,309
You scared everyone.

1423
01:33:15,789 --> 01:33:16,687
Curses.

1424
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:18,587
Come on, get out. Come on.

1425
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:20,558
Asha. Asha.

1426
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:24,161
By, God!

1427
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:25,825
It's a mad house.

1428
01:33:25,899 --> 01:33:27,730
God knows where Rajinder is.

1429
01:33:27,801 --> 01:33:29,200
Quit Anjali.

1430
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:34,467
Glory to Goddess!

1431
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:46,579
Freeze.

1432
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:49,718
You stinky terrorists.

1433
01:33:50,824 --> 01:33:52,382
Who's he calling terrorists?

1434
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,657
You three, who else?

1435
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:55,922
How do you know?

1436
01:33:56,463 --> 01:33:58,328
I feel he's addressing them.

1437
01:33:58,432 --> 01:34:00,127
Shut up.

1438
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:04,133
Whom did he speak to now?
- You three, who else?

1439
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:05,468
How do you know?

1440
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:07,530
I feel he's speaking to them.

1441
01:34:07,641 --> 01:34:10,576
I said no talking.

1442
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:13,846
Who did he speak to now?
- You three, who else?

1443
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:15,609
How do you know?

1444
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:17,913
I feel he's speaking to them.

1445
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:20,243
oh, shut up.

1446
01:34:21,221 --> 01:34:23,917
You three, over here.

1447
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:28,355
You four, over there.

1448
01:34:32,232 --> 01:34:33,164
No.

1449
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:37,561
Similarly, they sc***
us in '47 with divide and rule.

1450
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,163
You are right. - He's right.

1451
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:42,807
So, shall we take revenge? - Yes.

1452
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:46,244
But, Pakistanis will
strike first. - Why?

1453
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:49,441
Who gave you the right?
- I feel it's our birth right.

1454
01:34:49,516 --> 01:34:51,643
Why, was he part of your dowry?

1455
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:53,214
We're elder.

1456
01:34:53,253 --> 01:34:54,880
We got freedom first.

1457
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:56,183
Freedom?

1458
01:34:57,391 --> 01:34:58,858
Let's toss.

1459
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,252
Get a coin. - You do.

1460
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:02,295
You don't have a coin?

1461
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:03,589
Give it to them.

1462
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:05,222
Give it. - Here you go.

1463
01:35:29,623 --> 01:35:31,682
We're generous after all.

1464
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:54,714
Asha.. - Don't touch me.

1465
01:35:55,415 --> 01:35:56,541
What happened?

1466
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,947
What were you doing with my sister?

1467
01:35:59,319 --> 01:36:01,753
Nothing, she liked my song, so we..

1468
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:04,416
You always have 100 excuses
not to dance with me.

1469
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:07,252
Asha, please.
What are you saying? - Please what?

1470
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:10,330
You were dancing with
my sister after killing my dad.

1471
01:36:10,631 --> 01:36:12,258
Killed your dad?

1472
01:36:14,501 --> 01:36:15,729
Dad's dead?

1473
01:36:16,703 --> 01:36:20,901
Asha, dad could've been saved if you..
- I killed dad.

1474
01:36:21,508 --> 01:36:23,476
Yes, if you hadn't delayed
in trying to hide it..

1475
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:25,603
.then maybe dad would've been alive?

1476
01:36:26,146 --> 01:36:27,841
I was trying to save you, you idiot.

1477
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:30,809
That's not our habit,
to leave someone in trouble.

1478
01:36:32,452 --> 01:36:33,919
our habit..?

1479
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:38,154
As if we kill people by throwing
soup containers, don't we?

1480
01:36:38,425 --> 01:36:40,723
I wouldn't be surprised if you did.

1481
01:36:43,397 --> 01:36:47,800
Thank God you didn't say
that the ISI is behind this.

1482
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:50,300
As if the ISI are
really honest people.

1483
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:53,339
And the RAW are on a picnic
in Baluchistan, aren't they?

1484
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,533
Those people who came
in boats were from Pakistan.

1485
01:36:55,609 --> 01:36:57,600
More people die in our country,
we're more troubled.

1486
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:59,441
So? Will you trouble the world for it?

1487
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:01,140
osama was finally
found in your backyard.

1488
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:02,443
Give us Kashmir, end of matter.

1489
01:37:02,516 --> 01:37:04,507
You can't handle what we gave you.

1490
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:06,210
Give us Kashmir?
Why should we?

1491
01:37:06,286 --> 01:37:07,275
It belongs to us, you get out.

1492
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:09,515
Why should we get out?
It's ours, you get out.

1493
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:11,817
You're seizing other's property,
aren't you ashamed?

1494
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:13,524
Who teaches you all this?

1495
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:15,357
Don't you have a mind?
- We live carefree.

1496
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:17,556
Not like you. We've a big heart.

1497
01:37:17,764 --> 01:37:19,356
That reminds me of Shahid Afridi.

1498
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,128
After losing the semi-finals he said..

1499
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:24,262
.the Indians don't have a big heart
like us. So, should we lose the match?

1500
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:26,635
Even we...are worried
about Shahid Afridi..

1501
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,173
..he must have said it under pressure.

1502
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:29,607
What's the big deal? - Yes.

1503
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:31,267
You're all so naive.

1504
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,142
If anyone says anything
against Allah..

1505
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:34,477
..and you all set out for
'Jihad'.

1506
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:35,742
It's not a habit.

1507
01:37:35,816 --> 01:37:38,512
We're always judged by our name,
our religion.

1508
01:37:38,585 --> 01:37:39,574
We weren't like this.

1509
01:37:39,653 --> 01:37:41,587
People like you made us what we are.

1510
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:43,816
Turned you into someone
who's burning their own homes?

1511
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:45,222
Don't force me.

1512
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:48,420
You have more scams than
we've terrorist attacks.

1513
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:50,588
And you'll be surprised
to know, madam..

1514
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:52,859
..more people die of
corruption in your country.

1515
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:54,867
Come to your senses.
- That's exactly what I was saying.

1516
01:37:54,935 --> 01:37:56,300
What were you saying?

1517
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:01,368
What were you two
talking about Rajinder?

1518
01:38:03,443 --> 01:38:05,138
He passed away.

1519
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:10,378
The soup container
slipped out of my hands..

1520
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:13,578
..fell through the window
and landed on his head, and..

1521
01:38:15,889 --> 01:38:17,584
I don't get one thing.

1522
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:19,182
You're Punjabis, I am a Punjabi..

1523
01:38:19,259 --> 01:38:21,159
..so, why make soup?

1524
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:22,752
You had to act like Britishers.

1525
01:38:22,829 --> 01:38:24,160
What did you gain from it?

1526
01:38:25,432 --> 01:38:27,525
Start calling the relatives.

1527
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:29,124
I'm off to the police station.

1528
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,602
Mom. Mom.

1529
01:38:35,909 --> 01:38:37,137
Hello.

1530
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:40,403
Dad! oh, God!

1531
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,175
Mom, Its dad.

1532
01:38:54,761 --> 01:38:58,527
Rajinder. Rajinder.

1533
01:38:58,598 --> 01:39:00,293
Thank you, God.

1534
01:39:01,668 --> 01:39:04,364
Thank you, God. Rajinder. - Dad.

1535
01:39:06,306 --> 01:39:08,331
Rajinder.

1536
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:12,544
What happened? - Dad.

1537
01:39:13,113 --> 01:39:14,774
Dad, we thought..

1538
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:18,112
Nothing.

1539
01:39:19,886 --> 01:39:21,877
Where are your trousers?

1540
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:27,556
I found him like this in the streets.

1541
01:39:27,828 --> 01:39:30,126
Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

1542
01:39:30,197 --> 01:39:32,665
Dad, did you go to the hospital?

1543
01:39:34,601 --> 01:39:36,330
It's really important, dad.

1544
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:37,529
Where have you been?

1545
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:45,701
I was coming home. - Yes.

1546
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:52,543
Then suddenly something
heavy fell on my head.

1547
01:39:53,587 --> 01:39:54,815
And...and..

1548
01:39:56,289 --> 01:39:57,654
And then?

1549
01:39:58,492 --> 01:39:59,516
And then?

1550
01:39:59,593 --> 01:40:00,560
Yes.

1551
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:06,331
No.

1552
01:40:06,533 --> 01:40:07,557
Rajinder.

1553
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:10,259
Rajinder, do you recognize us?

1554
01:40:11,838 --> 01:40:12,827
Yes.

1555
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:16,140
Who's this man?

1556
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:17,570
This is Aman.

1557
01:40:17,644 --> 01:40:19,737
Aman, your dad.

1558
01:40:21,314 --> 01:40:22,576
Welcome home, sir.

1559
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:26,145
Rajinder, lipstick.

1560
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:27,446
Mom!

1561
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:30,422
Sorry, sorry.
I won't say anything.

1562
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:31,514
Come on, Rajinder.

1563
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:33,616
I'll get you some hot soup.

1564
01:40:33,693 --> 01:40:36,560
Come on. This way.

1565
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,894
Dad. Careful.

1566
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,733
Tell me one thing,
Rajinder, where's your pant?

1567
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:45,465
I lost it.

1568
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,439
Walk carefully.

1569
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:49,808
I'll take my stuff tomorrow.

1570
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,199
Where are you going?

1571
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:54,611
I don't know.

1572
01:41:15,135 --> 01:41:18,593
Excuse me, where's A8.

1573
01:41:19,372 --> 01:41:20,634
What name?

1574
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,798
Jai Singh.

1575
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:23,308
That's me.

1576
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:33,285
Thank you.

1577
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,759
Mom. - Yes, dear.

1578
01:41:41,828 --> 01:41:43,625
Look, daddy.

1579
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,432
It isn't my fault, but...

1580
01:41:56,877 --> 01:41:58,674
...I wi ll have to say sorry.

1581
01:42:04,684 --> 01:42:05,810
Say it.

1582
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:11,152
I am sorry.

1583
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:18,689
It's okay.

1584
01:42:23,403 --> 01:42:25,337
Come on, let's go home.

1585
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:41,547
Aman.

1586
01:42:52,732 --> 01:42:53,892
Turn around, sweetheart!

1587
01:43:08,181 --> 01:43:08,840
Asha.

1588
01:43:28,301 --> 01:43:31,202
We'll keep arguing
all our lives, Asha.

1589
01:43:31,938 --> 01:43:33,735
We'll live together for the argument.

1590
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,232
At least I can, Aman.

1591
01:43:38,845 --> 01:43:42,440
I am a Pakistani and you're a Indian.

1592
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:44,406
But nobody's perfect.

1593
01:43:51,691 --> 01:43:53,283
Can we live together?

1594
01:43:54,294 --> 01:43:58,390
I know that...we cannot live apart.

1595
01:44:04,337 --> 01:44:10,537
"Feels incomplete, sweetheart."

1596
01:44:12,712 --> 01:44:15,545
"Why fight over trivial things?"

1597
01:44:15,615 --> 01:44:18,209
"Why argue without a reason?"

1598
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:20,816
"You're the one I want to love."

1599
01:44:20,887 --> 01:44:24,789
"You're the one I want to die for."

1600
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:28,759
"Asha."

1601
01:44:29,829 --> 01:44:34,163
"Life's filled with
a little intoxication."

1602
01:44:38,805 --> 01:44:40,432
"Asha."

1603
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:45,235
"It feels incomplete without you."

1604
01:44:46,946 --> 01:44:50,609
"It feels incomplete without you."

1605
01:44:53,386 --> 01:44:54,284
Right, son.

1606
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:56,515
Will you keep Asha happy? - Yes.

1607
01:44:56,589 --> 01:44:58,614
Speak louder, this is a Punjabi house.

1608
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:00,421
Yes, yes, I'll keep her happy.

1609
01:45:05,765 --> 01:45:06,857
Curse you.

1610
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:16,734
"Tons of tears...and sorrows."

1611
01:45:17,243 --> 01:45:20,679
"God, please tell us what do we do?"

1612
01:45:23,883 --> 01:45:27,375
"Tons of tears...and sorrows."

1613
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:31,346
"God, please tell us what do we do?"

1614
01:45:31,424 --> 01:45:34,916
"More pain, less relief."

1615
01:45:35,195 --> 01:45:38,528
"No one's fine in this world anymore."

1616
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:42,193
"And then there's your parents,
brother and sister."

1617
01:45:42,235 --> 01:45:44,499
Where in India do you hail from?

1618
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,669
"Total chaos, that's your love."

1619
01:45:48,775 --> 01:45:52,609
"It's completely crazy, I'm dead."

1620
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:55,842
"Total chaos, that's your love."

1621
01:45:55,915 --> 01:45:59,783
"It's completely crazy, I'm dead."

1622
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:17,500
"Your mom hates me."

1623
01:46:17,637 --> 01:46:20,902
"Your brother irritates me."

1624
01:46:21,274 --> 01:46:24,641
"Daddy's always lost."

1625

"Your sister manipulates me."

1626
01:46:28,415 --> 01:46:31,782
"Bunch of dacoits, always on a high."

"Tons of tears...and sorrows."

1635
01:47:00,413 --> 01:47:03,780
"God, please tell us what do we do?"

1636
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:07,377
"More pain, less relief."

1637

01:47:11,124 --> 01:47:15,117
"And then there's your parents,
brother and sister."
