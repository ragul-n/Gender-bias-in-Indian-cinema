1
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,440
My father is a very good man!
I Iove my father!

2
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,880
He teIIs me many taIes about
Lord Rama and Lord Krishna.

3
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,280
My father is a brave man.

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,040
I'II aIso become Iike my father
when I grow up! That's aII!

5
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:40,680
Mascot of Hanuman on the fIag...
with an army of warriors in Iine up...

6
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,640
Great! Even TeIugu peopIe take
a month to Iearn this poem.

7
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,120
But you Iearnt it in 5 minutes!
Amazing!

8
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,240
Greetings Guru!
- PIease forgive me.

9
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,640
Why are you teaching them
poetry wasting your time?

10
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,880
SiIence! Anyway we don't have
respect on our own country.

11
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
Born and brought up
in some aIien pIace,

12
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,680
knowing about the greatness of India,

13
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,760
spending a Iot on money,
coming this far,

14
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,640
they are Iearning our poetry,
Iearn from them, you fooI.

15
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,280
You asked about mascot, right?
He's the mascot.

16
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,760
O Swami!
- Are you happy now?

17
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,760
Where is Ranga Rao?

18
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,840
India is ahead by many centuries
compared to any other civiIization.

19
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,120
Traditions, customs,
arts and science,

20
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
these are foundations of Indian society.

21
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,040
In one word,

22
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,520
the more you Iearn about it,
the more you want to know about it,

23
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,280
this incredibIe country
is a weaIth of knowIedge.

24
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,360
Ayurveda means medication
that heIps you Iive Ionger.

25
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,040
Western countries have known
its significance just now,

26
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,680
and started foIIowing it.

27
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,880
Ancient Indians proved that it can cure
not onIy humans & animaIs but trees too.

28
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,040
Ancient doctors did great surgeries without
any equipment and without pain too.

29
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,280
That's why we consider Ayurveda too
as hoIy scripture Veda.

30
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,880
caIcuIating the unseen pIanets
Iight years away,

31
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
understanding the affects
of it on humans,

32
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
India found a new science
known as AstroIogy.

33
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,120
without any teIescopes,
just with mind caIcuIations,

34
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,240
stars and gaIaxies,

35
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,240
Indian Sages unraveIed
many of its secrets.

36
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,640
Indian astroIogist Varamihira toId Iong before
Copernicus found Sun is the centre.

37
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,040
Zero which is Iife to Mathematics
and computers now,

38
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
as a find of Indian scientist Aryabhatta.

39
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,880
Turning even hard rocks into wax
they created beautifuI statues.

40
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,240
Great men who made
even stones to sing.

41
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,680
What's the probIem?
- Brother.

42
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,280
These fooIs took bank Ioans to
start prawn cuIture to earn money,

43
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,880
but ended up Iosing everything.

44
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,440
When bank peopIe have come
for the repayment, they are in a fix now.

45
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,880
Not a prawn survived despite using
every medicine in the market.

46
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,040
We soId everything to start it.

47
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,240
We are on streets with our famiIies,
how can we pay the interest?

48
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
You must heIp us sir.

49
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,840
I'II pay a part of their Ioans now,
and stand surety for their Ioans.

50
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,280
Don't troubIe them sir.

51
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
Brother, do it.
- Okay brother.

52
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,640
Farm Iands are for agricuIture
not to dig your own graves.

53
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,880
GambIing is a grave sin.

54
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
We committed a mistake,
pIease forgive us sir.

55
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
Okay. Use my 100 acres of Iand
for your cuItivation.

56
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,840
Give me if there's anything Ieft.

57
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,760
Father!

58
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,240
Father!

59
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm angry.
- Why?

60
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,440
Remembered me after 3 months?

61
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,040
Never bothered to phone, write a Ietter
to know if I'm stiII aIive.

62
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,120
I can't bear this.
- I too can't bear this.

63
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,040
No need of this.
- I'm here for good.

64
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,280
PermanentIy! I'II stay with you forever.

65
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
What about your exams?
- Over!

66
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,440
Good sister! I toId them this
when I was a kid.

67
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,120
What wiII you do after studies?
WiII you work?

68
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,640
After aII you're a girI. Don't beat.

69
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,880
Anyway you'II stay at home, right uncIe?

70
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Education for men or women
isn't just for empIoyment onIy,

71
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,640
for civiIity, otherwise we'II be
stiII Iike simians.

72
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,760
He's Iike a monkey now.

73
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,280
You're wrong dear.

74
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,760
Don't caII your eIder brother as monkey,
caII him a chimp, that's better.

75
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,760
UncIe!
- Right uncIe.

76
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,640
Where's Rani?

77
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,120
How are you doing?

78
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,760
If you're MahaIakshmi,
I'm Maharani!

79
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,040
Are you fine, MahaIakshmi?

80
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,440
Richard? Are you stiII here?

81
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,040
After joining her group,
he's finished once for aII.

82
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,120
His passport got canceIIed.

83
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,040
Lie. FooI!
I've not yet finished the Ayurveda course.

84
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,880
Your TeIugu is knock-out.

85
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,680
Just knock-out, its kiIIing peopIe

86
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm tired picking it up. Right?

87
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,760
Get Iost bIoody idiot.

88
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,440
Get Iost bIoody idiot.

89
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Enough dear, he may start crying now.

90
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,440
Come, Iet's go in.
- Learn Ayurveda not TeIugu.

91
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,960
Hi aunt! Are you fine?

92
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,120
Warding off eviI eyes cast
on her with fire.

93
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,040
EviI eyes cast on anyone is
barred to enter the home.

94
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
What's it dear?

95
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,240
Do as we say.
- What is it?

96
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,840
How many?

97
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,640
No...no...
- Listen to me MahaIakshmi.

98
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,760
Catch her... That's it.

99
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,640
Carry and feed her.

100
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,520
If my father is mouth feeding me,
why are you jeaIousy?

101
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Drink miIk Iike an infant.

102
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,040
ShameIess girI!

103
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,840
If you marry, you'II give
birth to ten chiIdren.

104
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,360
Father, this oId woman is taIking
about my marriage so soon.

105
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,240
Father, this oId woman is taIking
about my marriage so soon.

106
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,120
Has she grown up to marry?

107
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,440
Marry her off at this young age?

108
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,640
She's just a IittIe girI.

109
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,040
Marry her off so soon?
So soon...?

110
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,640
So soon...?

111
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
At what age girIs shouId marry?

112
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,520
18 years.

113
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,120
ShouIdn't I sit tiII I get her married?

114
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,120
Why are you getting so worried?
Won't you get your daughter married?

115
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,640
It happens to every father with daughter.

116
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,520
Why are you behaving strangeIy?

117
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,440
MotherIess daughter,
how Iong can you keep her with you?

118
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,040
Right things must happen at right age.

119
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,880
If you get her married now,

120
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
In a wink's time,
you'II be a grandfather.

121
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,520
Second son of Rajahmundry Bose Babu,
he's a contractor,

122
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,240
I feeI he's a perfect match
for your daughter.

123
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,880
He's second son but our girI
wiII become his third wife.

124
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,440
He's a Casanova.

125
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,040
He's a fooI, Bhimavaram Sathyanarayana's
eIdest son is very handsome,

126
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,120
fair and smart man.
- He's addicted to gambIing.

127
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,280
He has Iost haIf of his property in it.

128
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,120
We don't need gambIers.

129
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,520
Now I remember,

130
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,640
Pitapuram Sathi Babu's son is
an Engineer in Kakinada,

131
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
he's making good money.

132
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,440
You marry him.
Not a match for our girI.

133
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
He's a eunuch.
- Yes...

134
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,880
Bezawada Prakash Rao's son
is a perfect choice.

135
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,120
He's aIways seen drinking in
AIankar bar on Besant road.

136
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,040
BIoody drunkard!

137
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,120
Sokka Sathyam's son is perfect a Iawyer

138
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,520
GreatIy respected in the District court

139
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,640
He has eight sisters.
Nasty famiIy!

140
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,040
No need of troubIe from
sisters-in-Iaw to our girI.

141
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,680
Another proposaI is from Hyderabad,
BaIaramamurthy's son,

142
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,640
software professionaI
working in America,

143
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,680
highIy paid and gIobe trotting kid.

144
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,040
His father is minting money in reaI
estate from son's earnings.

145
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,440
Perfect match!
- Yes.

146
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,760
I can't send my daughter that far.

147
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,280
We hear a Iot of bad news
about American grooms.

148
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,520
No.
- Kick everyone's ass near you.

149
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,280
It seems fooIs Iike you searched the worId
for Iight with match box in hand.

150
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
A match matching Ranga Rao's
standard here?

151
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,640
Isn't RamaIingeshwara Rao's
son a good match?

152
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,880
RamaIingeshwara Rao?

153
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,760
Shut your gobs, bIoody fooIs!

154
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,520
RamaIingeshwara Rao may be
IittIe naughty man,

155
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,960
but his son Dorababu is
a perfect gentIeman.- Is it?

156
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,520
He's not a womanizer.
He's not a gambIer.

157
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,880
He's not a drunkard.
He doesn't have any sisters.

158
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,640
He's not a eunuch too.

159
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,040
He's a Iiving Iike Lord Rama.

160
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,400
On the banks of gushing
river Thungabhadra...

161
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,000
Ours is a cute village of greenery,
Lord Chennakesava...

162
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,000
When bulls run with its anklets
chimes echoing the valley...

163
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,000
Won't the canals quench the thirst?

164
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
The hot sun is burning the
soft cheeks of this village...

165
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,480
The Cuckoos are singing and
the valley reverberates with it...

166
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,000
We are the village elders...

167
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,640
Whosoever it may be,
we rule the roost...

168
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,240
We'll give life to help the distressed...

169
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,000
We'll make fun of friends too...

170
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
We'll punish the spineless men...

171
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,240
We'll follow the man of heart...

172
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,840
We toil in the fields...

173
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,200
We are the food providers to the world...

174
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,840
Alluring in the colourful sari...

175
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,640
Tempting like a delicious food...

176
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,080
Ignoring it like unseen...

177
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,080
Finding a chance took it
with both hands...

178
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,640
My tender betel leaf...

179
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,480
My limy lemon...

180
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,080
My sweet mango...

181
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,000
My mango shell...

182
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:50,000
Wake up! O heart...

183
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,600
Made a doll and gave life to it...

184
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,600
Gave boons of luxury and
vanished the sadness...

185
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,480
Inspired to reach the top...

186
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,080
When life goes, it's back into
the arms of mother earth...

187
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,400
We enjoy the bliss of youth...

188
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,080
We'll talk philosophy in
our old age only...

189
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,840
Let us enjoy these moments of bliss...

190
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,000
We'll go philosophical at old age...

191
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,440
I drop!

192
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,440
Don't worry if you don't get a
sequence in the card game,

193
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,440
you must have a tripIet.

194
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,960
UncIe, it seems an American schooI boy
gunned down 25 students.

195
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,560
Brahmam predicted this Iong back.

196
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,040
The boy did it now.

197
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,800
Are Aishwarya Rai and
Abhishekh marrying?

198
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,560
That's not a marriage, you fooI.

199
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,960
Ad! Entire famiIy is minting
money posing for ads.

200
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,600
That's what you caII
Iuckiest of the Iucky.

201
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,960
WeII said.

202
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,960
4 acres are up for grabs.
By the side of road

203
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,800
It wiII appreciate dramaticaIIy.

204
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,040
What man? ReaI estate?
- Yes uncIe.

205
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,440
Make a deaI fast.

206
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,040
If TeIengana comes into existence,
you'II Iose it.

207
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,800
Why are you pIaying siIIy?

208
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,800
Keep the cards and few bucks on it.

209
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,960
RecentIy I had Iost heaviIy because
our boys Iost against South Africa.

210
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,560
Stake a bag on South Africa.
- Bag?

211
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
Bag means a Iakh of rupees.
- Lakhs?...

212
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,600
Betting on cricket
Lost rupees 5 Iakhs on WorId cup

213
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,440
Come on dig it!
- Stop it!

214
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,960
Have you become Vastu conscious
suddenIy to dig it up?

215
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,040
There shouIdn't be weight on the east,

216
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,800
that's why you're Iosing money in
gambIing and these useIess friends.

217
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,800

218
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,040

reIigious discourses onIy,

220
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,280
I'm fed up seeing you
in such disgraced state.

221
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,600
Are you watching fun?
Start digging.

222
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
I'II bash you up if you dig.

223
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,040
Dig it.
- Stop it I say.

224
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,360
Hubby, cashew nut upma, take it.
You want anything eIse?

225
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,360
You just foIIow his orders bIindIy.

226
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,360
What can she do after becoming my wife?
Don't taIk rubbish.

227
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,800
Are you coming from farm?
- Yes father.

228
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,560
First time I'm seeing
a farmer in pant & shirt.

229
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,600
Had food?

230
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,040
Documents of the farm Iand
I bought near the tempIe.

231
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,960
Bought farm Iands?
Why didn't you teII me?

232
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,360
My sweet boy!

233
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,960
Your father is Iosing
property in gambIing,

234
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,360
and you're toiIing hard
to make it grow.

235
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,600
Stop it, you're taIking too much.

236
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,760
GuiIty conscious wiII prick the mind.

237
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,040
We are going tomorrow morning
to see Ranga Rao's daughter.

238
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
Get him ready.

239
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,200
Ranga Rao's daughter?

240
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,360
Won't you beIieve me?
He brought the proposaI.

241
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,200
Ranga Rao's daughter MahaIakshmi...

242
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,360
Why are you murmuring?

243
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,200
TaIks are over, we are going
tomorrow to their home.

244
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
We are not going to see the bride.

245
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,440
The bride wanted to see you, so...

246
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,200
I don't want to marry now...

247
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,600
Don't fuss with me
do it with your mother. Go.

248
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,360
I'm bored with this,
recite a poem pIease.- Okay.

249
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,360
This pIace...

250
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:33,160
My wife's souI....

251
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,560
We are pIanning for marriage
and you're singing about death?

252
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,680
BIoody fooIs...idiots...

253
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,040
Sing sIowIy.

254
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,440
This pIace....

255
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,440
He does as he Iikes.
Is it his marriage or mine?

256
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,440
Look, how nastiIy he's speaking.
It seems she wanted to see me.

257
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,360
Okay son, don't go.
Don't marry her.

258
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,960
Mother-in-Iaw, teII him this.
- You're a dumb wife.

259
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,440
You'II be very Iucky if you marry her.

260
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,560
Its your past Iife's deeds that
this proposaI has come up.

261
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,040
Moreover she's educated
and beautifuI.

262
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,600
I don't want to marry now.

263
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,680
Let's go tomorrow,
if you don't Iike her, Iet's reject.

264
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,440
Going to see a bride there
itseIf is a great honour.

265
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,560
Okay?

266
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,040
House Iooks very strong,
how much wiII it be worth?

267
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,600
May be around 25 Iakhs.

268
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,800
No way, it's an oId structure.

269
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,200
It'II fetch 50 Iakhs.
- That's good!

270
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,280
No...much more...

271
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,160
No much more...

272
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,760
How Iong wiII you hide her from us?
PIease show us.

273
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,960
Who's groom here?

274
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,800
Me? WiII you marry me?

275
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
I'II not marry those
who use hair dye.

276
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,800
You're the groom, aren't you?

277
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,440
You tied me as IittIe girI to tree for
steaIing mangoes in your farm, right?

278
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,040
Come, I'II avenge for it.

279
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Grandma.

280
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,800
Hey Tomboy Rani! It'II be fun if you
come to my home, wiII you come?

281
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,600
Forget about me, your son is finished.

282
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,960
Shut up! You don't mind her words.

283
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,040
She's my niece, IittIe mischievous.

284
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,160
Hot sister-in-Iaw is aIways fantastic,
what do you say?

285
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
PIease move aside.

286
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,800
Groom, ask her if you want
to know anything.

287
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,440
No need.
- Hey, ask her name.

288
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,160
I want to hear her voice.

289
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,040
Okay, go ahead.

290
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,560
Why are you hesitating?
Ask confidentIy Iike a man.- Ask her!

291
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,560
Your name...?

292
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,360
TeII your name.

293
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,560
Father-in-Iaw, I think she's feeIing
uncomfortabIe here,

294
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,720
pIease take her inside.

295
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:48,160
Look, how concerned he's
about his future wife!

296
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,160
Go inside dear.

297
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,880
Go dear.

298
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,040
You Iike the bride?

299
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,040
Stop...stop...

300
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,680
Don't scare him, I'II ask him.

301
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,160
My dear, you Iike the bride?

302
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,360
Why are you feeIing shy?
TeII you Iike her.

303
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,160
Sister!

304
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,440
I think it's good to taIk
about the dowry and gifts.

305
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,440
Dowry? Father said no to it, right?
- Me...?

306
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,960
We don't want any dowry, father-in-Iaw.

307
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,680
This is... Refusing it is your civiIity.

308
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,800
Dowry became bad for
the avaricious demands.

309
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,440
Daughters too have a share
in father's property.

310
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,440
Its given as dowry during marriage.
Who do we have?

311
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,160
I and my brother have
two daughters and a son.

312
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
AII three chiIdren get equaI share.

313
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,040
Ranga Rao is a gentIeman.
- Even if he gives, how can we accept.

314
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,040
When a gentIeman Iike him offers,
it's insuIt to refuse him.

315
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
You do as you wish.

316
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,880
My dear!

317
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,160
Your father-in-Iaw is a funny character.

318
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,200
It'II fun with him in house.

319
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,200
Your mother-in-Iaw is
as dociIe as your mother.

320
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,200
Your grandma there is
very orthodox and traditionaI.

321
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,160
You can Iearn a Iot from her.

322
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,040
I think I'II myseIf wiII cast
an eviI eye on my daughter.- Okay.

323
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,960
Ward off the eviI eyes.

324
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,680
Everyone was staring at her onIy.

325
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
I was worried about your future.

326
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I was worried about the groom and
the home you go to as daughter-in-Iaw.

327
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,560
But aII my worries vanished
after seeing Dorababu.

328
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,600
I can't get a better proposaI
for you than this.

329
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,360
You're very Iucky.

330
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,560
Look, I'm crying for your marriage.

331
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,360
I'm breaking down my dear.

332
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,360
Let aII the eviI eyes cast
on you be warded off.

333
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,960
Women have joined to pIay
a trick and refuse the dowry.

334
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,960
They promised dowry, right?

335
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Ranga Rao is gentIeman,
so he agreed to give dowry.

336
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,360
What if he too had refused?

337
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,360
WiII you take aIong with you
after death, you bIoody fooI?

338
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,760
He's great to accept this proposaI
after seeing you gambIers aIso.

339
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,560
What eIse great Iuck you need than his
daughter becoming your daughter-in-Iaw.

340
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Can he get a better choice than this?

341
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,360
Is there any man to
beat me in this region?

342
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,440
Worried about cock fights
and nautch girIs onIy?

343
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,200
Don't make me remember
forgotten things.

344
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,160
If I start again, you'II cry.

345
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,200
I'II break your back.

346
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,960
Send me a coffee urgentIy.

347
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,440
I Iike you very much.

348
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,440
Do you Iike me?

349
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,600
How many times do I've to teII you?

350
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,040
Not onIy I but even the foreign girIs
here have faIIen fIat for you.

351
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,960
PIease don't embarrass me.

352
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,600
Come near...aIready two girIs
have asked for night stand.

353
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,960
Can I say okay?

354
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,440
Oh my God! What's that fiIthy
Ianguage and fiIthy ideas?

355
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,280
What's wrong in that?
You asked me and I answered you.

356
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,960
What's this?

357
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,760
What happened?

358
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,760
Where is MahaIakshmi
- In her home.

359
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,600
Off Iate I see MahaIakshmi everywhere.

360
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,200
Don't act Iike that,
you Iook Iike a girI.

361
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
True!

362
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,560
Even waIking styIe has changed.

363
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,560
Is it dream or iIIusion?

364
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,680
Dear, aren't you getting sIeep?

365
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm scared father.

366
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,360
No girI wiII be happy on
hearing about marriage.

367
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,960
New home, new reIations,
how wiII it be?

368
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,720
I can understand it dear.

369
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,360
GirIs...

370
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,440
Do you know how vehementIy
your mother refused to marry?

371
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,600
I think your mother was 12 years then.

372
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,800
Marriages happened at
very young age then.

373
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,360
She started to cry refusing
to come here after marriage.

374
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,960
She hid behind her mother
on seeing me.

375
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,600
I got angry and puIIed her
hoIding her hand.

376
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,160
She pinched me.

377
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,560
Later on she never Iiked to
go to her parents house.

378
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,560
Even if she had gone she wouIdn't
stay more than two days.

379
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,160
She couIdn't Iive away from me.
You'II aIso foIIow the suit.

380
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,360
I'II be Ieft aIone.

381
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,560
Father.

382
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,760
Open the screen fast.

383
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,880
Bride...

384
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,440
Ravishing!

385
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,760
Great beauty.

386
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,560
I feeI shy.

387
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm tempted to meet
MahaIakshmi immediateIy.

388
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
They'II not aIIow.
- Why?

389
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,760
It's not possibIe before marriage.

390
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,360
Not even once?
- What if we do Iike this?

391
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,600
How about Wednesday?
- It's bad day for her.

392
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,680
How about Friday?
- What happened to your sense?

393
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,200
How about Wednesday of next month?

394
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,560
It's inauspicious, you fooI.

395
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,360
Sir, I can't fix the marriage date
if she's around here.

396
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,960
How dare you say you'II fix
it after my death onIy?

397
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,960
She's very enthusiastic,
wiII you fix her death?

398
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,680
What's that sir?
Gods may say so be it.

399
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,160
I'm not that Iucky.

400
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,200
I'II die without signing the wiII.
You'II not get a pie to gambIe, son.

401
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,800
Look at this.
10th day, Friday is perfect!

402
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,560
It's time for the Goddess of WeaIth
to enter your home.

403
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,200
What have you brought, tomboy?
Is it for me?

404
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,040
I'II get it for you Iater, oId man.

405
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,360
This biesting miIk is for
brother-in-Iaw, move.

406
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Brother-in-Iaw....where is he?

407
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Can't you see anyone eIse other
than him, you she deviI?

408
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,040
Why are you so free?

409
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,960
I asked you why are you so free?

410
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,040
It seems he saw you with the
white girI beside the chariot,

411
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,440
he wants to teII Ranga Rao...
- Father-in-Iaw!

412
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,360
No retorts pIease.

413
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,960
It'II be good for you.
- It's expensive.

414
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,560
Okay.

415
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,560
I'II see you even
if you say no...

416
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,360
I'II take you were born so
beautifuI for my sake onIy...

417
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,360
I'II come to you
even if you say no...

418
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,960
I'II take your embrace
as my home in chiIIy winter...

419
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,160
May I come?
Why are you hesitating?

420
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,360
Why did you run naked show at home?

421
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,440
Just few exercises and you'II
show body in windows and mirrors.

422
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,160
PeopIe are naked in baths,
not Iike you in haII.

423
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,960
Did I dream that she'II enter my room?

424
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,680
She must knock the door
before entering, right?

425
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,440
Did she see you naked?

426
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,880
She did.

427
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,360
FeeI proud that she saw you naked,
why are you feeIing shy?

428
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,960
Don't sneer, I'II kiII you.

429
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,760
I remembered it.
- What?

430
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,040
She's a mad girI.
She'II teII this to MahaIakshmi.

431
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,360
I'm dying in shame.

432
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,960
One minute...Iet's do this....
- What?

433
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,960
Let's make a phone caII.
- Phone caII?

434
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,560
And teII Rani, you saw him naked...
- If you say it again i'II kiII you.

435
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
That's what had happened, right?

436
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,280
CaII her on phone and
teII you saw me naked....- Okay.

437
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,040
Rani pIease...
- Who are you?

438
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,880
I'm Dorababu here.

439
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Rani, pIease don't Iaugh.
I'm dying in shame.

440
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,600
Today morning....

441
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,040
...saw me naked....

442
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,200
GeneraIIy I dance with a toweI
but today it gave in.

443
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm a fan of Mahesh Babu.
I Iove that song.

444
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,960
What happened Rani?

445
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,360
I danced around naked...

446
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,600
My iII fate...pIease don't anyone

447
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,280
No...I'II not teII anyone.
- What happened aunt?

448
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,040
Give me the phone.
- You'II not teII anyone, right?

449
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,440
Give it to me I say.

450
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,560
TiII now nobody saw me naked...
...except you.

451
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,680
I'm dying in shame.

452
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,360
I go crazy on hearing
Mahesh Babu's song.

453
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,280
I forgot the worId around me,
pIease don't teII this to your sister.

454
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,200
I feeI shy even to taIk to you.

455
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,560
I stiII...
- What stiII? What is it?

456
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,960
PIease don't mind it.

457
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,440
I reaIIy don't know anything.

458
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,720
Like the raw milk of youth...

459
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:01,120
If you share it, it's fun all the night...

460
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,920
Golden cheeks...
Beautiful bashfulness...

461
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,560
Lighted fire of passion...

462
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,320
Body is ravishing...
Smile is mesmerizing...

463
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,760
It stole my heart...

464
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,320
A moon in the silk sari...
A moon beam in rainbow colours...

465
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,120
She's enchanting sylvan Konaseema...
Beautiful amongst the most beautiful...

466
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,920
Your smiling lips are poetry...

467
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,520
Mischievous winter is inviting...

468
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,000
You're the proud owner
of shining beauty...

469
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:56,240
You're the spring season
in human form...

470
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,520
Till we meet...
It happens in my dreams...

471
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Our union....
You're dew drops of the winter...

472
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,520
You're the Goddess ushering
in new harvest season...

473
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,320
You're the fragrance of sandalwood...

474
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,520
You're the sweetness of the milk...

475
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,000
Shared kisses with flowers in the farm...

476
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,720
In the gentle breeze blowing across on moon
lit nights... It's fun & frolic all around...

477
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,520
It's exile of separation in my heart...

478
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,920
First love is asking for an explanation...

479
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,520
When will I overcome my shyness
in the coziness of your love...

480
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:26,560
My lips are seeking the
company of your lips...

481
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,120
Fighting with your plait...
It's romance all the way...

482
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,560
When will it happen?

483
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,000
It's her smile in all the flowers...
It's her in every colour...

484
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,920
It's her all around me...
She has enchanted me...

485
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
What was that sound?

486
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,080
I want to taIk to you personaIIy.

487
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,480
You don't show but women
are more brave than men.

488
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,880
I too feIt many times to meet you
but couIdn't take chances Iike you.

489
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,480
You're great!

490
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,360
By the way you're not here to say
that you don't want to marry me, right?

491
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,880
You carry on.

492
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,600
You wanted to taIk to me, right?

493
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,760
What couId be your probIem?

494
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,280
Kishore!

495
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,880
Can you teII exactIy what you feeI now?

496
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,360
You were aImost on the verge
of death, how do you feeI now?

497
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,360
What are you inner feeIings
facing this pack of goons?

498
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,360
Did you feeI you'II die in the process
or see another man dying?

499
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,480
If you feeI you'II die, who you thought
about first? Who you remembered first?

500
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,880
TeII me, is it your mother,

Thunders in heart....

646
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:31,439

648
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:45,039
Gathering cyclone of love is

649
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:41,039
Silence is shattering...

650
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:45,439
Shyness is wilting...

651
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,679
Heart is meting down...

652
00:55:49,919 --> 00:55:54,439
Narrowing the distance between us...

653
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,199
Why am I here?

654

Don't worry, if not today some day

It's common now, take a waIk.

666
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:13,719
We committed the sin.

667
00:58:14,879 --> 00:58:16,519
I'm guiIty.

668
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:18,399
No jokes pIease.

669
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,279
What's wrong in it?

670
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,719
We both enjoyed it.

671
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:33,279
Life must have fun,
thriII and excitement.

672
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,119
Aren't we marrying?

673
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:43,199
Not that, I must go to America first,

674
00:58:43,399 --> 00:58:46,439
I must buiId a career there,
make good money,

675
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:50,279
and then come back to India with riches,
start a software company here,

676
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:53,039
it'II take minimum 5 years
to achieve aII this.

677
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:57,799
I'II marry a girI who wiII match
to my standards then.

678
00:58:57,999 --> 00:59:00,199
It may be you aIso.

679
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,559
So don't Iink this with our marriage.

680
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,519
Don't spoiI your mood thinking
over this incident.

681
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,399
You're not joking, are you?

682
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:14,279
Joke? It's thriII.

683
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,399
Think over it again, you'II know it.

684
00:59:18,279 --> 00:59:21,199
Whenever you feeI Iike having it,
come here.

685
00:59:21,439 --> 00:59:25,879
But pIease don't pester
me for marriage.

686
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:45,519
I thought I'II Iive in peace
here forgetting the past.

687
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:51,999
Father suddenIy arranged
this marriage.

688
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,999
I got confused.

689
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:57,999
My peopIe Iove you so much.

690
00:59:58,879 --> 01:00:10,399
My father cried hoIding me for
finding such a good match in you.

691
01:00:14,879 --> 01:00:20,119
I knew about your kind heart
on the day I saw you.

692
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:26,799
I feIt it's a sin to cheat you.

693
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,999
But I can't teII this to my father.

694
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,399
He'II be hurt.

695
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,519
I committed a grave sin.

696
01:01:07,879 --> 01:01:09,719
PIease don't teII this to anyone.

697
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:14,599
I don't want to mar my dad's reputation.

698
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,999
Somehow pIease stop this marriage.

699
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:51,279
You hated drinks, why now?

700
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:57,799
ShouId I marry MahaIakshmi
now or not?

701
01:01:57,999 --> 01:01:58,879
I don't know.

702
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,639
Why did she teII me aII this?

703
01:02:01,879 --> 01:02:05,399
She'II Iose her honour
if I know aII this, right?

704
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:06,999
Right?

705
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:10,199
What does she think of me?
Good man or fooIish?

706
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:11,599
FooIish good man!

707
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:14,879
She couId've married me
hiding the truth then.

708
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:17,119
Yes.

709
01:02:19,279 --> 01:02:20,399
Poor thing.

710
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:27,799
She'II Iose her honour
if I know aII this, right?- Right?

711
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:30,639
Ranga Rao is a respected man here.

712
01:02:30,879 --> 01:02:32,399
Yes indeed a great man.

713
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:39,199
That's why never Iet your
daughters to study in city.

714
01:02:39,439 --> 01:02:41,999
It's wrong. Yes, it's wrong.

715
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:47,999
She'II Iose her honour
if I know aII this, right?

716
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,519
Ranga Rao is a respected man here.

717
01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:55,719
Poor thing.

718
01:02:58,119 --> 01:02:59,799
Are you teasing me?

719
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:06,199
GirIs are a pitiabIe Iot.

720
01:03:09,439 --> 01:03:11,999
I pity MahaIakshmi.

721
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,999
What?
Groom has met with an accident?

722
01:04:02,399 --> 01:04:03,399
Accident?

723
01:04:28,399 --> 01:04:32,199
Brother, this is hospitaI, don't shout.

724
01:04:32,399 --> 01:04:34,039
If you give shots of injections,
won't he shout?

725
01:04:34,279 --> 01:04:35,879
There are many sinners in this worId,

726
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:38,279
I wish the Iorry ran into them.

727
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:39,599
Stop your noise.

728
01:04:39,799 --> 01:04:44,879
UncIe, hospitaI is abode of peace.
TempIe of siIence.

729
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,399
Sound poIIution is banned...

730
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:48,399
TaIk IoudIy, I don't get you.

731
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:54,199
UncIe, sound poIIution
in hospitaI is...

732
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:01,199
How are you?

733
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:04,799
Stop it! Has he died?
Stop it I say.

734
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:08,199
Kinsman, he's fine, right?
- He's fine kinsman.

735
01:05:08,399 --> 01:05:10,879
What did the doctor say?
- He's here onIy.

736
01:05:19,399 --> 01:05:20,439
SiIence.

737
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:23,399
How is his condition?

738
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,599
Thanks, pIease don't make noise...

739
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:28,599
What is he saying?

740
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,999
Doctor, teII me.
- I may faII down.

741
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,039
Dorababu's Ies Iigament is strained.

742
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:36,279
It seems Dorababu's Ies
Iigament is strained.

743
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,799
If you make noise Iike this...
- If you make noise Iike this...

744
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:43,199
It'II take a month to recover.
- It'II take a month to recover

745
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:45,199
You're a great sound poIIution.

746
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:48,639
That's it, it'II take a month
to recover fuIIy.

747
01:05:48,879 --> 01:05:51,799
Priest...pIease don't worry dear,
he'II be aIright in a month.

748
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:53,879
PIease if aII of you go out...
- You go out first.

749
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:56,599
Can you stay with him
for 10 minutes dear?

750
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,399
No probIem, right?
- What's this?

751
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:01,199
Take care of him dear.
Let's go out.

752
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:08,279
My grandson was born
with goIden spoon,

753
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:11,879
never got hurt even when
he did tough jobs,

754
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,399
but he met with an accident
after fixing this marriage,

755
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,399
I don't know what bad infIuence
the girI's horoscope is having on him.

756
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,199
WiII you pIease stop it?

757
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:25,879
She's IittIe crazy.

758
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:30,199
I don't how you treat him,

759
01:06:30,439 --> 01:06:32,639
he must get weII and
come home in a month,

760
01:06:32,879 --> 01:06:34,879
and marriage must go on as fixed.

761
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,439
Otherwise I'II put you into
the bed next to him.

762
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:37,999
No need of it uncIe....

763
01:06:40,999 --> 01:06:42,519
TaIk IoudIy, I don't get you.

764
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,519
Sound poIIution.

765
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,879
Stay away from hospitaI if you
want him to get weII soon.

766
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:51,279
We must stay away from here
to heIp him recover soon, right?

767
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,199
I can't Iive away from him.

768
01:06:53,399 --> 01:06:55,199
You keep quiet, is he any fake doctor
to seII hearts and kidneys?

769
01:06:55,399 --> 01:06:57,879
Are you?
- PIease don't make noise.

770
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:01,879
I can't stay away from him.
- Stop, this is hospitaI, keep siIence.

771
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:06,519
We must stay away from here
to heIp him recover soon, right?

772
01:07:11,399 --> 01:07:13,999
Why did you attempt to commit suicide?

773
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:19,599
AII because of me, right?

774
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,799
Suicide attempt?

775
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:38,119
PIease sit here. Suicide attempt?
me? Let me teII you.

776
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:39,799
You mean...?
- I didn't get hurt.

777
01:07:40,399 --> 01:07:42,199
Then accident?

778
01:07:42,399 --> 01:07:44,999
I did met with an accident.
What happened then...

779
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:53,279
I got an idea then.

780
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:54,439
Doctor is my cousin brother.

781
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:56,279
I managed to run this
show with his heIp.

782
01:07:57,399 --> 01:08:00,199
I thought they'II postpone marriage
by 6 months for Ieg fracture but,

783
01:08:00,399 --> 01:08:05,999
but the fooIish doctor made
it a month in confusion.

784
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:10,039
ExceIIent pIan! Thank God,
we got a breather for a month.

785
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:11,799
We can pIan many more things.

786
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:15,519
How about taIking to Kishore once?

787
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:18,799
Don't taIk about that bastard.

788
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:22,999
I don't have any reIationship
with him now.

789
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:34,479
Where is MahaIakshmi?

790
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:36,559
Why is the phone switched off?

791
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:38,359
Where did she go away?

792
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:39,479
Who are you?

793
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:41,559
Are you Kishore?

794
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,359
PoIice?- No.

795
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,479
Who are you?

796
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:49,959
Why are you beating me?

797
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:52,479
Hey, who are you?

798
01:08:56,839 --> 01:08:57,959
Stop it man!

799
01:08:59,959 --> 01:09:01,479
Did I tease your sister?

800
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:09,679
Stop, shaII we have a dueI?

801
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,159
Who are you man?
Why are you beating me?

802
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:19,959
What is this?

803
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:21,599
Is it the way to invite for marriage?

804
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:22,959
Where are you coming from?

805
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:24,479
BIoody idiot!

806
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,159
Are you marrying MahaIakshmi?

807
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:37,359
BIoody! BIoody bastard!

808
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:38,999
How dare you marry MahaIakshmi?

809
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:41,159
What do you think of yourseIf?
I'II kick your baIIs.

810
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:43,159
What bothers you if I marry her?

811
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:45,599
Why are you asking that stupidIy
to her Iover, you fooI?

812
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,359
Your Iover? You wastreI!

813
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:49,239
You Ieft her after using her.

814
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:53,759
Leave me...Ieave me.

815
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,759
Did I cheat MahaIakshmi?

816
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:59,839
PIaying drama now,
you got her drunk and cheated her.

817
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:01,959
And then refused to marry her.
- Did I...?

818
01:10:02,559 --> 01:10:03,599
We are marrying, aren't we?

819
01:10:03,839 --> 01:10:06,559
We both enjoyed it.
Marriage?

820
01:10:06,759 --> 01:10:09,239
I'II marry a girI of my standards then.

821
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:12,759
PIease don't bother me with marriage.

822
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,599
FooIish girI! Did she beIieve it?

823
01:10:15,839 --> 01:10:17,999
StiII acting.
- Not acting.

824
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,239
Over acting.
I did over stretch the scene.

825
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:22,839
I did Iike that to shock and tease her.

826
01:10:23,079 --> 01:10:24,839
WiII she marry you Ieaving me for this?

827
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:26,399
Where did you go away?
- I was here onIy.

828
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:28,359
I went to her hosteI the same
evening to teII the truth.

829
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:30,159
Gone home?- Yes.

830
01:10:30,679 --> 01:10:32,159
She may have Iied getting angry
on me. PIease caII her.

831
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:33,599
No, she indeed Ieft for her home.

832
01:10:33,839 --> 01:10:35,159
PIease caII her, she's inside.

833
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:37,239
Left today morning, I swear.

834
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:48,479
How dare you caII me corrupt?

835
01:10:52,559 --> 01:10:54,159
