1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,801
What's wrong with this city?

2
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:11,168
Somewhere there are
ashes and somewhere smoke.

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,566
Why doesn't someone say something?

4
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:16,801
Why do we endure smoke quietly?

5
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:19,501
Now it's the limit of endurance.

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:23,035
Stop smoking. The world will move on.

7
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:25,433
Smoking at public
places is prohibited.

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,135
Violation will lead to penalty.

9
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:31,235
Don't smoke. Or let others smoke.

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,500
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

11
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:40,566
Who doesn't want to be happy?

12
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:45,567
But at what price?

13
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:49,335
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

14
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:54,268
Smoking is injurious for you.

15
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,068
And for your dear ones.

16
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:05,601
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

17
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:47,138
''l'll steal your peace and slumber.''

18
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:50,500
''Catch me if you can, baby..''

19
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:55,636
''Catch me if you can.''

20
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,402
''Hid it in my heart,
never spoke a word.''

21
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,068
''He stands exposed in my view.''

22
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:13,533
''Never spoke about it ever.''

23
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,766
''No one could understand it ever.''

24
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:17,368
''But it what makes
my heart beat each day.''

25
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:22,103
''l'll steal your peace and slumber.''

26
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,234
''Catch me if you can, baby..''

27
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:27,468
''Catch me if you can.''

28
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,399
''l am like a shadow.''

29
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:04,200
''Always right behind you.''

30
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,135
''Ty to catch me.''

31
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:10,034
''And l slip through your hands.''

32
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,904
''l am faster than your heartbeat.

33
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:21,370
''Always in your sights,
but still invisible.''

34
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,901
''Hid it in my heart,
never spoke a word.''

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,702
''He stands exposed in my view.''

36
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,133
''Never spoke about it ever.''

37
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,400
''No one could understand it ever.''

38
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:32,001
''But it's what makes
my heart beat each day.''

39
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:36,736
''l'll steal your peace and slumber.''

40
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,800
''Catch me if you can, baby..''

41
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,868
''Catch me if you can.''

42
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,636
Nature's justice is beyond
human to comprehension..

43
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,435
This stoy is from
the era when film-stars..

44
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:38,968
..lived larger than
life just like their movies.

45
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:42,568
And who would know
it better than a blacker.

46
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,169
And that night came
a new twist in their lives.

47
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,534
Zara Peter Fernandez.

48
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,701
A heroine from the 60's..

49
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:54,402
..who crossed all
limits for success.

50
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,200
Her enthusiasm to
become an actress..

51
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,666
..beauty and arrogance.

52
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,469
This is why Zara had
Iess friends...and more foes.

53
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,667
Just one film old
and she's the owner of Impala.

54
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:16,633
''Chandni Raza''

55
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,600
She hailed from the
small city of Dehradoon..

56
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,268
..and quickly became a successful
star owing to her talent.

57
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,534
Zara and Chandni shared an old bond.

58
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,633
Before their success..

59
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,534
..Zara and Chandni shared a room..

60
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,967
..in aunt D'Silva's
Marina House as paying guests.

61
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,000
Chandni never had
a problem with Zara.

62
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,768
But Zara always sidelined Chandni.

63
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,633
Careful, Chandni.

64
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,634
Otherwise people say
you've stooped really low.

65
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:54,101
l wish you had said this
at the screen-test yesterday.

66
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,267
You could've been selected.

67
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,533
What's your problem, Zara?

68
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:01,933
l've a problem with you..

69
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:04,467
..and evey other girl like you..

70
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:07,902
..who sleepwalks all the
way here to become an actress.

71
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,201
Doesn't that apply to you too?

72
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:13,800
lt doesn't.

73
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:17,434
l don't play sisters
and friends like you.

74
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,768
My Bengali film was a hit.

75
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:24,768
Calling yourself Chandni
doesn't make you a star.

76
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,799
Bobby Chadda.

77
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:39,600
A famous director of Hindi films.

78
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,033
He's made many big films.

79
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:44,235
''He gave Chandini
her first big break.''

80
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:59,101
l want to change
people's viewing habits.

81
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,033
That's why l think differently.

82
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,067
You'll look amazing in this bikini.

83
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,568
'Reena Mera Naam' will
be a sensational film..

84
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,402
..due to your complete changeover.

85
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,000
Sory, sir, but..

86
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,334
l won't expose.

87
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,567
Virman Shah, a composed actor.

88
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,668
The hero of Zara's latest
film 'Ujjwal Nirmal Sheetal'.

89
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,400
And Chandni's old flame.

90
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,733
l mean bo_riend.

91
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Good.

92
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,335
And an_ay,
exposing isn't your cup of tea.

93
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,700
Don't take me for granted, Virman.

94
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:46,469
l refused because
l didn't want to hurt you.

95
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:49,668
What am l taking..
- Don't underestimate me.

96
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,234
Now l will definitely do this film.

97
00:09:56,532 --> 00:10:00,369
lf you do this film,
then it's over between us.

98
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,836
Tough luck Subbaji,
first your film, and now Zara.

99
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,336
Subba Prasad,
Star Director and Producer.

100
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:37,902
Subba was the one
who made Zara a star.

101
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,067
For this film l am looking..

102
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,567
..for Hindi Cinema's
first sex-symbol.

103
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,500
l did come across a few,
but none of them had it.

104
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,568
My search has brought
me to you, Zara.

105
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,466
l understand, sir.

106
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,234
What will l have
to do to get this role?

107
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,634
Neither dance, expression nor pose.

108
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:02,266
Only expose!

109
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:23,935
Subba Prasad started
out with making south Cinema.

110
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:26,500
He gave them their first superstar.

111
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:38,400
Ravi Kumar aka Ravi Sahab.

112
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:39,800
A man still connected
to his homeland..

113
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,233
..Gorakhpur, UP.

114
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,933
'A Son of Soil' for the press.

115
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:44,467
But a star with style.

116
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,367
His south films
were more successful..

117
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,066
..than his Hindi films.

118
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,901
Before he ventured
into films he was a cop.

119
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,835
And was totally skewed in the head.

120
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,335
Never enjoyed such hospitality.

121
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:45,200
Sir, you haven't touched the thing.

122
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,600
That's why l am behind the bars.

123
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,600
Ravi.

124
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:53,399
Salute him.

125
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,834
l only salute the tricolor flag.

126
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:57,533
Not some corrupt politician.

127
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,199
Who is he?

128
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:16,634
The police department
has some nutcases too.

129
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,533
Right.

130
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,601
His actions confirm it.

131
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:23,634
He's smoking cigarette
without lighting it.

132
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:24,867
Yes, sir.

133
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:26,366
When he was a kid..

134
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,301
..his father clobbered
him for smoking.

135
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,134
l see.
- Since then he quit smoking.

136
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,701
But he didn't give up cigarettes.

137
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:40,602
Grover
we need his statem!ent by 5pm.

138
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:42,099
What did you say?

139
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:43,999
What did you say?

140
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:45,866
You want my statement.

141
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,801
l'll stripped off your uniform.

142
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,267
l'll strap a collar
around your neck..

143
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,434
..and recruit you in the dog squad.

144
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:54,933
Come on.

145
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,265
Don't stare.

146
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:58,033
Come lick your master's boot.

147
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,701
Come now or you'll
have nowhere to go.

148
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,200
Come on.

149
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,900
There comes the dog.

150
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,767
Good boy.

151
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:23,733
Now lick.

152
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,633
Lick it.

153
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,067
you will cherish it

154
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,566
Lick it.

155
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:40,100
What have you done?

156
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,233
l lost it.

157
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,634
'The minister survives miraculously# 

158
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:58,069
'But Ravikumar was convicted
and sent to jail for two years.# 

159
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:59,466
'..and thrown out of the force# 

160
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,533
'He caught Subba Prasad's attention.# 

161
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:11,135
'..and he offered him
a south Indian film.# 

162
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,667
So...what do you think?

163
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:15,333
You aren't taking anything.

164
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,500
Jana get him a cup of coffee.
- Okay, sir.

165
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:22,467
So...will you work in my film?

166
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,667
Of course, l will.

167
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,300
But l have a condition.

168
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:29,666
l won't get beaten
up by the villain.

169
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:32,902
And you will shoot in Paris.

170
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,968
You see l love that
film 'An evening in Paris'.

171
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:39,534
Sir, he's already got
a big attitude problem.

172
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:41,167
l wonder what's next.

173
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,333
You might have heard the saying.

174
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:48,868
A prince may be born naked.

175
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:51,167
But he still becomes a king.

176
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:56,801
And if you like befriending kings..

177
00:15:57,632 --> 00:15:59,934
..you have to do what he says.

178
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,065
Of course.

179
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:10,334
We'll work a bit on your styling..

180
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,934

l'm investing in this film.

274
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,568
The song is a winner.

Your favorite dish.

00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,900
They are delicious.

277
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,134
How long are you going to be upset?

278
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:06,833
lt's been two years.

279
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,267
You just don't get it.

280
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:19,935
Your anger,
attitude, it's just like mine.

281
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:24,069
No one knows,
but even l never admitted..

282
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:26,167
..that you're my step-brother.

283
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,468
And an ideal brotherjust like me.

284
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,400
Evey attitude like
the elder brother.

285
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:33,934
There's one difference.

286
00:24:35,232 --> 00:24:39,135
You toy with the law
and l uphold it.

287
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,268
When you're given a choice..

288
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:50,168
..to take-up ajob
for the sake of your love..

289
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:54,136
..and you have just
one minute to decide..

290
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:57,101
..otherwise your
child in Jaya's womb..

291
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:59,567
..dies with the mother, then..

292
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,401
Evemhing will seem right.

293
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:04,267
No matter how much you say,
Rajan Anna.

294
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:07,067
But you can't justify this.

295
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:12,567
When you fall in love..

296
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:14,900
..you won't see the difference..

297
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,935
..between wrong and right.

298
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:19,000
You will be helpless.

299
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,400
Not the way you see it.

300
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:28,333
l came because l promised mother.

301
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:31,767
Otherwise we always end up like this

302
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:49,834
Ravi sir. One photo, sir.

303
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:53,033

Sir, welcome to Bombay.

How do you feel here?

306
00:25:56,532 --> 00:25:57,933
You should ask Bombay..

307
00:25:58,032 --> 00:25:59,767
..how it feels now that l am here.

308
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,168
Sir, Virman's the main
hero in Subba sir's film.

309
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:04,133
So what part are you playing?

00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,500
A Superhero.

Thank you, sir.

315
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:21,168
This reminds me of a few lines.

316
00:26:22,432 --> 00:26:25,034
''l am the sea, l know my skills.''

317
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:30,468
''Wherever l go they
will make way for me.''

318
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,900
That will be all.
Thank you vey much.

319
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,800
Thank you.

320
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:34,000

326
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,199
Hello.

327
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:54,168
You don't shake hands with kids.

328
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,133
You bless them.

329
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,434
Polish this and keep it there.
- Okay.

330
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:04,434
And clean the books as well..

331
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:05,900
Shall we begin?

332
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,234
Sir, can we get your
make up done first.

333
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:10,934
God's already taken care of that.

334
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:12,967
Give me my lines
- Yes.

335
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,936
First Virman says.. l am the brain.

And l've the power.

337

This shot ends here.

338

Shall we rehearse once?

339
00:27:25,132 --> 00:27:26,233
Yes.

340
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:33,900
Shall we rehearse once?

341
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:37,735
Rehearsals are for
those who aren't confident.

342
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,067
We'll shoot.

343
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:53,066
Somebody call the spotboy!

344
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,766

You're right.

360

You may be the brains.

361
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:00,634
But l have both brains and power.

362
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:03,567
And l'll do whatever
needs to be done.

363
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:05,265
Cut it.

364
00:29:06,332 --> 00:29:07,933
That wasn't the line. Mishra.

365
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:09,500
Yes, sir.

366
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:13,135
Sir, you goofed up.

367
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,002
The line is ''You are the
brain and l have the power''.

368
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,466
So what did l say?

369
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,735
You said ''You've
brains and power both''.

370
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:25,001
You mean to say
l don't have brains?

371
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:26,833
No, no, sir...l..

372
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:27,967
No, Mishra.

373
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,101
''l've brains and power''
that's what l will say.

374
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,767
l..

375
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,533
Lights off.

376
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:41,001
Sir, it's written in the script.

377
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:42,467
Here.

378
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,501
Whatever l say becomes the script.

379
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:47,266
Put it down.

380
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:49,133
You'll have a super-hit script.

381
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:54,502
This is how it might
be in your South films.

382
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:57,599
But we won't tolerate this here.

383
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,167
You're too hot-blooded.

384
00:30:03,232 --> 00:30:06,335
You're fortunate to
be on Subba sir's set.

385
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,101
Or else this heat
would have got you.

386
00:30:15,532 --> 00:30:17,767
What do you achieve
by annoying me?

387
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:21,333
What do you achieve
by defaming me?

388
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,135
You threaten me
with the fire of hell.

389
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,767
Me, the one who
consumes fire like water.

390
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:34,635
Mishra, did you get that?

391
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:38,667
Ravi Kumar. Virman.

392
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,434
This dialogue is vey
important for this film.

393
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,600
Lights.

394
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:45,666
We'll need 15 minutes, sir.

395
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,434
There's been a power-trip.

396
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,067
Mishra.
- Sir.

397
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,434
Let's do some other
scene post lunch.

398
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,000
Yes.

399
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:14,699
And henceforth these two..

400
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:16,400
..should never be
on the sets together again.

401
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,069
Sir, how will we complete
this film like this?

402
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,600
'Ujjwal Nirmal Sheetal'
will get made.

403
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:29,869
lt will be a film that
people will remember forever.

404
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,700
This is not just another film.

405
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:34,833
l am making box-office histoy.

406
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,335
Music.. Camera.. Action!

407
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,533
''Eveybody.''

408
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:03,667
''This is my stoy.''

409
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,100
''This is what l feel evey day.''

410
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:09,666
''So lonely.''

411
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:14,968
''ln my city...l am alone.''

412
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:19,336
''l don't know...who l am.''

413
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,534
''l love you lady.''

414
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,867
''Please be mine.''

415
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:28,202
''Say yes...and l'll be fine.''

416
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,469
''ln my city...l am alone.''

417
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:36,870
''l don't know...who l am.''

418
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,267
''l love you lady.''

419
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,334
''Please be mine.''

420
00:32:41,632 --> 00:32:45,802
''Say yes...and l'll be fine.''

421
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,634
''Whether its day or night.''

422
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,669
''All that the heart thinks
about is love.''

423
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:57,503
''My heart's a drifter.''

424
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:09,636
''ln my city...l am alone.''

425
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:13,870
''l don't know...who l am.''

426
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:16,134
''l love you lady.''

427
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:18,433
''Please be mine.''

428
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:22,569
''Say yes...and l'll be fine.''

429
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:27,770
''The night is restless.''

430
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:32,236
''As l wait for you''

431
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,567
''Come fall in love.''

432
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:36,568
''Life's too short.''

433
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,801
''Life's too short.''

434
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:45,070
''The heart's always
Iost in your thoughts.''

435
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:49,869
''My heart's a drifter.''

436
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:00,400
''Whether its day or night.''

437
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:04,636
''All the heart thinks
about is love.''

438
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:09,403
''My heart's a drifter.''

439
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:22,569
''My heart's a drifter.''

440
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,000
Cut it.

441
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:26,533
Okay, boys, break for lunch.

442
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,034
Let's continue our conversation..

443
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:31,901
..with the rising star Zara
Fernandez on 'Parde Ke Peeche'.

444
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,301
We would like to know..

445
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:38,204
..whether you're taking your sex
symbol image in films too seriously.

446
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:41,401
l mean...your linkup with
a popular music director..

447
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:43,033
..is doing the rounds.

448
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:46,502
Who's seeing an off-beat director..

449
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,299
..you know what l mean?

450
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,501
Who...who are you talking about?

451
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:54,901
We didn't want to
reveal names, but..

452
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,169
..you know we're talking
about KD and Shabnam Rai.

453
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:08,267
lf you like to see
your name in the papers..

454
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,599
..then strut nude on the streets.

455
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:11,600
Why humiliate me?

456
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,501
You used me to get to producers..

457
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:24,900
..and l expect the
favor to be returned.

458
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:26,467
You are in the public
eye because of me.

459
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,466
You should be thankful.

460
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,967
Otherwise,
no one cares for you bitches.

461
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:31,100
Who switch men faster
than your clothes.

462
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:32,466
Darn you, KD.

463
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:35,168
Yeah! Sure!

464
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,334
Zara is a selfish bitch!

465
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,734
She used me for publicity.

466
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:53,333
l was hurt to know..

467
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:55,433
..that the media
dragged you into this.

468
00:35:56,966 --> 00:35:58,500
l'll sue them all.

469
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:08,502
l know you don't believe me.

470
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,269
And you won't believe
what l am going to say next.

471
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,367
l want to get married to you.

472
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:20,367
l don't have a big house like you.

473
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:22,400
But l'll keep you happy.

474
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,334
Please don't say no.

475
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:31,432
On one condition.

476
00:36:32,132 --> 00:36:34,000
After the marriage
we'll live in my house.

477
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:35,533
That's not possible.

478
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:36,900
What will people say?

479
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,534
Aren't they saying enough already.

480
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,333
Thanks to your Zara bitch.

481
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,700
l am so sory, Shabnam.

482
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,167
l am so sory for it.

483
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:45,600
Come on.

484
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:47,600
Now stop this and
make a formal proposal..

485
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:57,270
Will you mary me...my Majesty?

486
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:06,034
l love you, Shabnam.

487
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,334
You're in a hury to leave.

488
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,800
Yes, l still have
to pay a few installments.

489
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,034
Six months later
l'll have my own house.

490
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:22,934
You're still shooting for your film.

491
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:25,000
lt'll release six months later.

492
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,767
lf it's a hit, then all's well.

493
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:29,801
But...what if it isn't?

494
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,467
Why do you say that, aunt?

495
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,100
l'll miss you, dear.

496
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,835
An_ay, let me know
if you need money.

497
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:40,833
How are you going to help me?

498
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,434
Not me, but you can
make a fast buck yourself.

499
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:47,667
Ranjit Desai called again.

500
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,500
He wants to meet you.

501
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:52,333
Desai of Roman Fabrics?

502
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:55,968
He's ready to pay 50,OOO
for a single meeting.

503
00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:59,268
To how many more girls have
you offered the same deal?

504
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:02,268
Did Chandni also?

505
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,468
Chandni will never do such a thing.

506
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:08,867
ln my 30 years of experience..

507
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:13,370
..l know whom to make
this offer and whom not to.

508
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,934
But this time you
made a mistake, aunt.

509
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:20,735
l won't sleep with
someone for 50,OOO.

510
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:30,635
l might reconsider if Desai's
willing to offer one lakh.

511
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:40,632
l really appreciate it

512
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:41,934
Thank you. Thank you so much.

513
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:43,566
You are welcome, sir!

514
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:44,767
Good evening, ma'am.

515
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,067
How may l help you?

516
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,768
Connect me to room 407 please.
- Sure.

517
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,234
May l know your name, ma'am.

518
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:53,134
Mr. Desai's expecting me.

519
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:54,199
Okay.

520
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:34,833
Did anyone ever tell you..

521
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,868
..you look sexier in real life.

522
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:50,966
Sir. Sir.

523
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:53,834
A maroon trench coat
for your next scene.

524
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,667
Okay.

525
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,202
Water. Get water.

526
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:58,299
Switch off the power.

527
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:00,000
Switch off the power.

528
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:02,634
Call the fire brigade.

529
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,667
Sir. Sir.

530
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:04,767
Ravi sir.

531
00:40:04,966 --> 00:40:06,534
Hury up. Get water.

532
00:40:10,132 --> 00:40:10,999
What happened?

533
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,167
A fire's broken out on
the sets of 'Reena Mera Naam'.

534
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:18,801
Move the camera out...quick.

535
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:21,667
Let go. Quick.

536
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:25,167
Help, help.

537
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:30,100
Sir, please don't go ahead.

538
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:32,766
Sir, there's danger ahead.

539
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,434
Let go of me.
- Sir, don't go ahead.

540
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:35,867
Let go.

541
00:40:47,132 --> 00:40:48,333
Help, help.

542
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:01,401
That moment was
special for Ravikumar..

543
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:05,735
A moment where he felt
even he could fall in love..

544
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:07,434
Love at first site.

545
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:34,636
Ravikumar, you came like
a whiff of cool air into my life..

546
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:37,301
..and rescued me on that fateful day.

547
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:41,169
Words failed me to describe
what l feel for you.

548
00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:44,802
Chandini, the most precious
relationship is being human.

549
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,701
Let's keep our relationship to that.

550
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:49,235
Your friend Ravikumar.

551
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:03,633
You're in love?

552
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:10,734
l am just another friend for him.

553
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:26,336
Why don't you tell
her what you feel?

554
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:30,468
My love may mean nothing to her.

555
00:43:31,766 --> 00:43:33,934
And an_ays,
she has been seeing Virman..

556
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:38,667
''You dwell in my eyes.''

557
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:41,434
''You're the one l talk about.''

558
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:44,235
''You live in my memories.''

559
00:43:44,432 --> 00:43:47,067
''You live in my thoughts.''

560
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:52,837
''With evey breath l take..''

561
00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:58,203
''..my heart beats faster for you.''

562
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:48,237
''Ever since our hearts met..''

563
00:44:48,532 --> 00:44:53,904
''..my love found its way.''

564
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:59,303
''l've found my desires. ''

565
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:04,604
''l've found my star.''

566
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:09,670
''l am entwined with your shadow.''

567
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:14,870
''l flow in your vein.''

568
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,868
''You dwell in my eyes.''

569
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,534
''You're the one l talk about.''

570
00:45:20,866 --> 00:45:23,335
''You live in my memories.''

571
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:26,134
''You live in my thoughts.''

572
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:31,837
''With evey breath l take..''

573
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:37,203
''..my heart beats faster for you.''

574
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,633
Scene 28 take 13 sound 1.

575
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:03,266
Action!

576
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:06,868
All your life was spent
in accumulating wealth.

577
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:09,701
But you forgot a
shroud has no pocket..

578
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,601
..and a coffin has no closet.

579
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:16,236
And the angels of death
don't accept bribes.

580
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:19,032
Cut it. Okay.

581
00:46:19,165 --> 00:46:20,165
Moving on.

582
00:46:21,065 --> 00:46:22,699
That was great, Ravi Kumar.

583
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:24,267
WonderFul perFormance.

584
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:31,701
You aren't good enough yet..

585
00:46:32,632 --> 00:46:35,067
..to comment on my acting, Zara.

586
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:38,135
l wish you would
put the same effort..

587
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:39,599
..in working on your character..

588
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:41,600
..like you work towards
taking off your clothes.

589
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:44,301
That will give me a chance
to applaud your perFormance too..

590
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:46,534
You have a problem with me?

591
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:52,434
You have a problem
with Chandni, Zara.

592
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:55,300
And whoever has a
problem with Chandni..

593
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:57,834
..l have a problem with them..

594
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:12,567
''Wherever l go..''

595
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:16,269
''..your memories haunt me.''

596
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,037
''Without you, life is a big void.''

597
00:47:21,332 --> 00:47:25,402
''Without you, life is a big void.''

598
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:30,704
''Without you, life is a big void.''

599
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:33,300
Cut it.

600
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:34,466
Now a close up.

601
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:36,500
Fix a 75 lens..
- Okay.

602
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:40,799
lt's a cut.

603
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:43,233
So tonight..

604
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:56,301
One film,
and your stocks have shot up, eh?

605
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:04,168
Before you get any
more ideas remember..

606
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:06,901
..evey actress is not for sale.

607
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:09,666
Yes, ma'am.

608
00:48:10,032 --> 00:48:12,934
You've always had a game
of one-up manship with Subba Prasad.

609
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,101
Ma'am, tea?

610
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,270
Your are even shooting
in the same studio as him.

611
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:20,633
And l've heard that..

612
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:23,435
..there's a similar
song in Mr. Prasad's film.

613
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,601
That song was mine.

614
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,234
He stole my song.

615
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:30,334
Mr. Prasad's 'Ujjwal
Nirmal Sheetal' is due on..

616
00:48:30,432 --> 00:48:32,600
..25th December, Christmas day.

617
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:34,467
And your film 'Reena Mera Naam'..

618
00:48:34,566 --> 00:48:35,967
..is scheduled for the same date.

619
00:48:36,032 --> 00:48:37,767
What do you have to say?

620
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:39,099
l really.

621
00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:40,800
Then may the best man win.

622
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:41,800
Mery Christmas.

623
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:42,899
We are ready with the shot,
Mr. Chadda.

624
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,034
Excuse me.

625
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,668
The bigger the controversy,
the bigger the hit.

626
00:48:49,132 --> 00:48:51,567
This song's going
to work for our film.

627
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,267
l told you, baby.

628
00:48:57,432 --> 00:48:58,432
l am star.

629
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:00,034
l owe it all to you.

630
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:02,400
lndia's first musical star.

631
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:03,666
KD.

632
00:49:03,866 --> 00:49:04,900
l love you.

633
00:49:04,966 --> 00:49:06,167
l love you, baby.

634
00:49:11,766 --> 00:49:12,867
Cut it.

635
00:49:12,966 --> 00:49:14,934
lt's a film wrap, pack up.

636
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:22,567
Yes, Mr. Gupta.

637
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,066
Yes.

638
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,200
Ahmadabad and Indore?

639
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:27,833
Great!

640
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:28,900
WonderFul.

641
00:49:29,332 --> 00:49:30,266
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

642
00:49:30,432 --> 00:49:32,767
Don't forget to send
the collection reports.

643
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,834
Pyaare.
- Yes?

644
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:37,733
All shows are full till Wednesday.

645
00:49:37,866 --> 00:49:38,933
Congratulations, sir.

646
00:49:39,165 --> 00:49:40,866
Did you have a word
with Alec? - Yes.

647
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:42,232
What did he say?

648
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:44,901
Tell him that 'Ujjwal
Nirmal Sheetal'..

649
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:47,668
..should disappear without a trace.

650
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:51,401
But, sir,
we're helpless in South India.

651
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:52,933
Ravi Kumar's a big
phenomenon down there.

652
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,400
Don't wory about that.

653
00:49:54,566 --> 00:49:55,967
No one's going to
watch that movie there.

654
00:49:56,065 --> 00:49:57,099
How come, sir?

655
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:58,500
There's a scene in the movie..

656
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:01,201
..where Virman Shah
abuses Ravi Kumar.

657
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,866
And l had this news published..

658
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,401
..in all their newspapers.

659
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:07,368
No one will enter the theatre..

660
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,601
Boycott this film..

661
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:11,901
That Virman has insulted our idol..

662
00:50:12,165 --> 00:50:13,799
Ravikumar should never
have done a Hindi film.

663
00:50:13,866 --> 00:50:16,435
Darn Virman, burn him to dust..

664
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:19,101
Naidu, l think we
should tell the people..

665
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:20,600
..it's not what they think.

666
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:22,867
lt's a film after all.

667
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,433
Part of the job.

668
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:25,900
Ty telling them.

669
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:27,533
They will burn the film.

670
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:31,534
But won't tolerate
anyone abusing you..

671
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,900
..even in a film.

672
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,967
Sometimes too much love also hurts.

673
00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:44,768
A rupees five ticket
forjust rupees three..

674
00:50:44,866 --> 00:50:47,268
Three for five!

675
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:50,769
Three for five!

676
00:50:50,966 --> 00:50:54,336
You're selling a
rupees five ticket for three?

677
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:55,533
The film's rubbish.

678
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,666
l'm stuck betting my money on it.

679
00:50:56,733 --> 00:50:58,501
Tying to save my skin.

680
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:01,335
Forget it. Let's go
watch 'Reena Mera Naam' again.

681
00:51:01,499 --> 00:51:03,200
Come on.
- Come on. - Three for five!

682
00:51:11,432 --> 00:51:13,267
Evemhing is been
organized in Bombay.

683
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:23,266
Chadda sir.

684
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:25,833
From Minerva to Aurora.

685
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:27,267
From Rajmandir to Kadambari.

686
00:51:27,332 --> 00:51:28,900
And from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.

687
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,370
'Ujjwal Nirmal Sheetal's' a big flop.

688
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:34,834
Okay. l'll hang up the phone.

689
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:47,302
That Bobby Chadda is behind this.

690
00:51:49,032 --> 00:51:51,601
He has got Alec D'Costa..

691
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:56,936
..to bribe the black marketers
of all territories and..

692
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:15,266
Are you okay?

693
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:17,834
Yeah...l am fine.

694
00:52:20,466 --> 00:52:24,570
Yes, it happens when l am stressed..

695
00:52:25,299 --> 00:52:26,266
l am okay.

696
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:27,533
l am fine.

697
00:52:39,766 --> 00:52:40,900
Yes.

698
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:42,933
Ravi Kumar.

699
00:52:43,399 --> 00:52:44,833
How are you, sir?

700
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:45,600
Greetings, sir.

701
00:52:46,232 --> 00:52:47,299
My father used to say..

702
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:49,534
..those who bow too often..

703
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,268
..yank the carpet
from under the feet.

704
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:55,068
That was a good move with D'Costa..

705
00:52:56,032 --> 00:52:57,466
But a film isn't a flop..

706
00:52:57,532 --> 00:52:59,700
..until it's posters
aren't taken down.

707
00:52:59,866 --> 00:53:01,767
You've a good sense of humor.

708
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:05,735
l was about to call you...
to congratulate you.

709
00:53:06,132 --> 00:53:08,567
The reviews of your
film are quite good.

710
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:11,569
Especially your character's
being applauded.

711
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,768
But your character
is totally undeserving..

712
00:53:13,966 --> 00:53:15,667
What do you mean, sir?

713
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:17,668
l'm a huge fan of yours.

714
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,834
Stop this filmy talk.

715
00:53:20,966 --> 00:53:22,634
Or else l'll string
you up some fan..

716
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,133
..and turn on the switch.

717
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:26,667
You won't know whether
you're a human or a top.

718
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:28,968
l'm being respectful and you..

719
00:53:29,299 --> 00:53:30,867
You don't know me.

720
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:32,766
l am not afraid of bloodshed.

721
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,735
Chadda, all the blood in your body..

722
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:36,768
..won't match up
what l pee once in day.

723
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:00,333
What's the matter?

724
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:04,667
lt's like a dream come true.

725
00:54:08,432 --> 00:54:09,966
Can l make a confession?

726
00:54:13,632 --> 00:54:16,334
Eveyone believes and
even talks behind my back..

727
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:19,934
..that l married you
for my own selfish reasons.

728
00:54:22,566 --> 00:54:24,634
Today l admit that it's true.

729
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:36,501
l've said ''l Love You''
umpteen times to you.

730
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:39,633
But l never meant it.

731
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:46,236
The biggest lie of
my life ''l Love you''..

732
00:54:47,132 --> 00:54:51,336
..turned into the biggest
truth after marriage.

733
00:54:57,899 --> 00:54:59,333
l am sory, sweetheart.

734
00:55:00,332 --> 00:55:03,535
l promise to be the KD you loved.

735
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:08,367
You got nothing to say?

736
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,202
Aren't we getting late
for the award's night?

737
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:27,269
l don't want to miss
my hubby's first award.

738
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:29,700
Love you.

739
00:55:58,366 --> 00:56:00,367
Your first best actress award.

740
00:56:00,466 --> 00:56:01,333
How do you feel?

741
00:56:01,466 --> 00:56:03,568
Honestly, l was not expecting it.

742
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:06,669
You guys only reward hit films,
don't you?

743
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,935
Are you hinting at Chandni's film?

744
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,200
No comments, but you understand.

745
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:47,467
KD sir. Few words.

746
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:50,933
This is for my love.

747
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,968
The one and only...Shabnam!

748
00:56:57,733 --> 00:56:58,767
Hey, Ronnie..

749
00:56:58,933 --> 00:56:59,933
Sir.

750
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:04,801
So...where's your star?

751
00:57:05,399 --> 00:57:07,134
Gone underground?

752
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:08,700
Chadda sir.

753
00:57:09,499 --> 00:57:11,634
Don't provoke him tonight.

754
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:14,434
ln fact, l would suggest that..

755
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:16,734
..don't even go close to him..

756
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:18,466
Enjoy the party.

757
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:42,900
Sir, we didn't see
you at the award function.

758
00:57:42,966 --> 00:57:44,567
You showed up directly
at the post-award party.

759
00:57:44,766 --> 00:57:45,967
My father used to say..

760
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:49,201
..those who are rewarded
with the love of the people..

761
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,434
..shouldn't be obsessed
about some statues!

762
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:28,434
Ladies and gentlemen

763
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:31,968
Welcome to our special
Holl_ood theme party.

764
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:34,534
A night full of surprises..

765
00:58:35,132 --> 00:58:38,134
Congratulations to
all the award winners..

766
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:39,633
Enjoy the evening..

767
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:45,168
Virman shouldn't
have refused the award.

768
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:48,868
After all he's just a
supporting actor in our film.

769
00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:52,302
One hit film and he
thinks he's Dilip Kumar.

770
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:54,500
Hit?

771
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,433
Zara.

772
00:58:57,799 --> 00:58:59,500
Sir. One photo, sir.

773
00:59:01,866 --> 00:59:04,368
Excuse me. - Yeah!

774
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:12,268
Where did you buy this dress?
- You like it?

775
00:59:12,566 --> 00:59:13,633
l do.

776
00:59:14,132 --> 00:59:17,134
l'm thinking of getting
the same fabric for my curtains.

777
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:19,801
Why do you always speak to me like that?
- Hello, Mr. Ravi.

778
00:59:19,899 --> 00:59:22,201
l just want to be your friend.

779
00:59:22,933 --> 00:59:24,267
Didn't anyone ever tell you..

780
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:26,901
..friendship happens
only among equals.

781
00:59:27,366 --> 00:59:29,801
That's why l want to be with you.

782
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:32,634
Even if it means your bedroom.

783
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:38,633
Ravi Kumar
if you think you are Vi\code(015b)hwamitra..

784
00:59:38,733 --> 00:59:40,034
..then l am Menka.

785
00:59:41,265 --> 00:59:43,367
l will break your penance.

786
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:44,800
You will be shattered.

787
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:49,734
Girls like you don't matter to me.

788
00:59:51,165 --> 00:59:53,700
Ravi Kumar plays by the rules.

789
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:57,568
He doesn't let anyone share his bed.

790
01:00:12,566 --> 01:00:13,867
Congratulations.

791
01:00:16,632 --> 01:00:17,632
Thank you.

792
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:21,268
Your good wishes are always welcome.

793
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:23,267
Then you don't need that.

794
01:00:38,632 --> 01:00:40,033
See you around then.

795
01:01:02,232 --> 01:01:03,967
Stop staring, sir.

796
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:06,966
Eveyone is watching.

797
01:01:32,532 --> 01:01:33,900
Ladies and gentlemen..

798
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,968
..and now for the
surprise of the evening.

799
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:39,802
We missed Ravikumar at
the awards night... but not here.

800
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,469
We have a special perFormance
by him tonight..

..along with the best music
composer of the year K.D.

..and the gorgeous new star Chandni.

804
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:11,666
''There's no one like me.''

805
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,601
''l know you couldn't
sleep last night.''

806
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:15,501
''Eveyone knows you're in love.''

807
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,600
''Tell me when this happened.''

808
01:02:17,766 --> 01:02:18,666
''Say it.''

809
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:34,600
''O, Reena.''

810
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:35,500
''O, Meena.''

''O, Zeenat.''

01:02:36,566 --> 01:02:37,400
''O, Salma.''

''..and so is Kashmir.''

818
01:02:52,299 --> 01:02:55,001
''My heart's on fire.''

819
01:02:55,899 --> 01:02:57,700
''l'll paint the town red..''

820
01:02:57,766 --> 01:03:02,070
''..with my beloved for company.''

821
01:03:02,933 --> 01:03:06,503
''l share the same feelings.''

822
01:03:06,566 --> 01:03:09,368
''You drive me crazy.''

823
01:03:11,766 --> 01:03:15,069
''O my love..''

824
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:18,868

''l share the same feelings.''

831
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,401
''You drive me crazy.''

832
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:47,935
''O my love..''

833
01:03:49,366 --> 01:03:51,835
''l am all yours.''

834
01:04:18,265 --> 01:04:25,271
''Let's together break all boundaries.''

''l'll paint the town red..''

844
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:11,937
''..with my beloved for company.''

845
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,402
''l share the same feelings.''

846
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:19,368
''You drive me crazy.''

847
01:05:21,766 --> 01:05:24,869
''O my love..''

848
01:05:26,265 --> 01:05:28,734
''l am all yours.''

849
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:50,100
Hello, Zara.

850
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:51,400
Remember me.

851
01:05:51,899 --> 01:05:53,734
l am in room _O9.

852
01:05:54,099 --> 01:05:54,766
Forget it.

853
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:56,500
You can't afford me now.

854
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:57,399
Why?

855
01:05:57,466 --> 01:05:59,167
Have you found a new hero?

856
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:00,866
_O9.

857
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:07,866
Clever.

858
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:09,499
Vey clever.

859
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,535
Singing along with
Chandni was a good idea.

860
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,167
After all she's a big success.

861
01:06:15,899 --> 01:06:17,700
Don't push your luck, Chadda.

862
01:06:18,466 --> 01:06:19,500
Stay away from me.

863
01:06:19,632 --> 01:06:20,866
l know. l know.

864
01:06:21,065 --> 01:06:22,633
Naidu was threatening me too.

865
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:25,332
What do you think..

866
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:27,467
..l'll be scared of
a school bully like you?

867
01:06:27,532 --> 01:06:29,333
Good show, Ravi Kumar. Good show.

868
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:31,400
Any plans to team up with
Chandni for the next film?

869
01:06:31,499 --> 01:06:32,566
Yes, yes.

870
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,534
That's exactly what
l was discussing with him.

871
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,801
You'll get an exclusive, Madan Hira.

872
01:06:37,065 --> 01:06:38,132
Excuse me.

873
01:06:41,966 --> 01:06:43,133
He's right.

874
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,333
Any such development..

875
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:47,900
..you'll be the first to know.

876
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:49,033
Thank you.

877
01:07:07,165 --> 01:07:08,399
Why did you close the door?

878
01:07:09,065 --> 01:07:11,434
That's what heroines normally
say before rape.

879
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,234
And an_ay, the school bully..

880
01:07:14,299 --> 01:07:15,333
..always hunts in the toilet.

881
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:17,834
Ravi Kumar, you're drunk.

882
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:23,134
Chadda sir, this way.

883
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:25,401
Let's have a talk.

884
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:29,233
Where are we going?

885
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:30,500
Just come along.
- Listen to me.

886
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,267
So what was that?

887
01:07:35,499 --> 01:07:37,500
Chandni and me in a film together.

888
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,067
Don't make a scene.

889
01:07:39,165 --> 01:07:40,733
The press will oversee.

890
01:07:40,899 --> 01:07:41,899
That's good.

891
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:44,133
They will have a chance
to write the truth.

892
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:54,602
Next time you'll be more careful
when you talk about us.

893
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:02,567
Help! Help!

894
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,334
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

895
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:22,900
Somebody help.

896
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:25,700
What happened?
- Is Ravi shooting for some film?

897
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:30,567
l don't see any cameras.

898
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,567
Must be on some building.

899
01:08:38,432 --> 01:08:40,834
The new actor's really amazing.

900
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:42,600
Sir.

901
01:08:43,632 --> 01:08:44,833
Sir. Spare him.

902
01:08:44,933 --> 01:08:46,234
Or he'll die.

903
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,567
l am as lethal as poison, Chadda.

904
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:55,368
Next it would be fatal.

905
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,367
Damn it!

906
01:09:12,366 --> 01:09:13,700
Thank you.

907
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,368
Congratulations.

908
01:09:39,065 --> 01:09:40,499
Fabulous perFormance.

909
01:09:41,366 --> 01:09:42,834
lf you say so, Ronnie?

910
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:52,001
l had a word with Mr.
Mehra for his next film.

911
01:09:52,933 --> 01:09:55,435
He says we could be a popular pair.

912
01:09:56,232 --> 01:09:57,166
What do you say?

913
01:09:57,632 --> 01:09:58,933
Will you be my heroine?

914
01:10:00,032 --> 01:10:02,334
Only on camera or off it too?

915
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,200
Stop pulling my leg.

916
01:10:05,933 --> 01:10:07,668
By the way we'll be great together.

917
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:09,533
You know why?

918
01:10:09,766 --> 01:10:12,635
Of course.
Because l've got what you want..

919
01:10:12,699 --> 01:10:15,101
..and you've got what l want.

920
01:10:15,432 --> 01:10:16,633
Jokes apart.

921
01:10:17,099 --> 01:10:19,468
There's another thing
common between us.

922
01:10:22,466 --> 01:10:24,467
We both love Chandni to death.

923
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:26,767
Cheers to that.

924
01:10:34,499 --> 01:10:36,033
lt's not easy to lift this.

925
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,167
You know how heavy it is.

926
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:43,001
Why are you always jealous
when l am on a roll?

927
01:10:43,265 --> 01:10:44,332
Take it easy.

928
01:10:44,933 --> 01:10:46,768
Why don't you do a few hit films?

929
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,768
And people will ask
for your autograph too.

930
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:51,001
Autographs don't
prove someone's talent.

931
01:10:51,265 --> 01:10:52,332
This is talent.

932
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,833
Take good care of it.

933
01:10:55,265 --> 01:10:56,866
lt might rust lying around.

934
01:10:57,666 --> 01:10:59,968
Histoy can never rust.

935
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:02,367
Because l am in it.

936
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:08,035
People often forget histoy, Zara.

937
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:12,202
People will remember
my film for years to come.

938
01:11:12,499 --> 01:11:14,767
Unfortunately, no one saw your film.

939
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:16,467
My film will be a hit, Chandni.

940
01:11:16,566 --> 01:11:17,433
How?

941
01:11:17,499 --> 01:11:19,567
Are you going to wave some magic wand?

942
01:11:19,766 --> 01:11:21,767
Or rake up a controversy..

943
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:24,702
..by having an affair
with someone like KD?

944
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:27,633
That's a good idea.

945
01:11:28,766 --> 01:11:30,701
How about Ravi Kumar for an affair.

946
01:11:37,132 --> 01:11:38,233
Bitch.

947
01:11:39,699 --> 01:11:40,866
Dare you.

948
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:46,100
Bitch.

949
01:12:03,366 --> 01:12:04,400
Bitch.

950
01:12:05,532 --> 01:12:06,532
Bitch.

951
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:09,633
Excuse me.

952
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:10,633
Zara.

953
01:12:14,799 --> 01:12:15,733
Let go. Let go.

954
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,401
Chandni. Zara.

955
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,234
Stop it, Zara.

956
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:22,800
Stop it!

957
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:36,001
Wow! What chivaly.

958
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:39,167
But what's the point
of covering someone..

959
01:12:39,232 --> 01:12:41,367
..who's already disrobed
in front of the world.

960
01:12:41,632 --> 01:12:43,867
Your Chandni's nothing but a slut.

961
01:12:43,966 --> 01:12:46,568
Virman, don't listen to her.

962
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,800
Look, l..

963
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:52,535
l didn't know there's
something between you two.

964
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,701
lf l knew l would've never..

965
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,834
You know what l mean.

966
01:13:00,332 --> 01:13:01,332
You're a nice guy.

967
01:13:02,566 --> 01:13:04,067
Keep away from such women.

968
01:13:07,099 --> 01:13:08,233
Look, Virman.

969
01:13:08,566 --> 01:13:10,301
l don't owe you an explanation..

970
01:13:10,799 --> 01:13:12,000
..but you know her.

971
01:13:12,165 --> 01:13:13,165
She's lying.

972
01:13:13,332 --> 01:13:14,299
They both are lying.

973
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:15,800
They are lying.

974
01:13:20,499 --> 01:13:21,466
Chandni.

975
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:26,502
l would've never believed if Zara
had said the same thing.

976
01:13:27,499 --> 01:13:28,466
But Ronnie..

977
01:13:32,065 --> 01:13:33,833
He has no reason to lie.

978
01:13:39,733 --> 01:13:40,967
Disgusting!

979
01:13:42,332 --> 01:13:44,133
Wait, l haven't finished yet.

980
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:45,233
Heroine!

981
01:13:45,299 --> 01:13:49,269
You pretend to be a virgin,
but eveyone knows otherwise.

982
01:13:50,432 --> 01:13:52,233
Excuse me. Excuse me.

983
01:13:52,532 --> 01:13:53,499
Zara.

984
01:13:53,632 --> 01:13:55,400
Zara. Stop it.

985
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:56,866
The press is watching.

986
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:57,900
You'll give a bad image to the film.

987
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,668
Come on. Get out of here.

988
01:14:00,599 --> 01:14:03,268
What world are you living in,
Mr. Subba Prasad?

989
01:14:03,499 --> 01:14:04,933
Your film's a flop.

990
01:14:05,532 --> 01:14:07,700
Ty to understand the facts.

991
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:10,334
l made a mistake trusting you.

992
01:14:11,332 --> 01:14:12,499
Zara, you're drunk.

993
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:13,900
Why don't you go up to your room?

994
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:14,999
Come on.

995
01:14:15,265 --> 01:14:16,199
Go along.

996
01:14:40,332 --> 01:14:41,332
Chandni.

997
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,067
Chandni.

998
01:14:55,232 --> 01:14:56,333
Sir.

999
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:01,001
Are you okay? - Yes. l am okay.

1000
01:15:01,165 --> 01:15:02,499
l am okay.

1001
01:15:04,599 --> 01:15:06,300
Have you seen Zara?

1002
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:17,100
Frankly l felt that.

1003
01:15:17,432 --> 01:15:18,199
Excuse me, sir.

1004
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:20,000
Have you seen KD?

1005
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:21,866
l don't think so.

1006
01:15:22,866 --> 01:15:24,167
Okay, thank you.

1007
01:15:25,899 --> 01:15:27,967
No. l was saying..

1008
01:15:51,366 --> 01:15:52,500
Where's Chandni?

1009
01:15:57,566 --> 01:15:58,466
She..

1010
01:16:08,566 --> 01:16:09,633
Yes.

1011
01:16:12,366 --> 01:16:13,533
What?

1012
01:16:14,566 --> 01:16:15,733
Are you sure?

1013
01:16:16,933 --> 01:16:18,801
But she was right here a moment ago.

1014
01:16:26,199 --> 01:16:27,366
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

1015
01:16:27,432 --> 01:16:31,702
Sory to interrupt the party but..

1016
01:16:31,899 --> 01:16:32,899
..we've had an accident.

1017
01:17:44,132 --> 01:17:47,468
The police are sure that
Zara's death is not an accident..

1018
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:52,036
..and they have
evidence to prove it.

1019
01:17:52,899 --> 01:17:56,135
People close to her say
that Zara was quite depressed.

1020
01:17:56,666 --> 01:18:00,569
And she had tried to
commit suicide before.

1021
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,968
She was depressed and also drunk.

1022
01:18:03,065 --> 01:18:04,299
But..

1023
01:18:05,032 --> 01:18:08,835
l mean, it is disappointing
if the film doesn't do well.

1024
01:18:09,566 --> 01:18:11,200
But you can't take your own life..

1025
01:18:12,632 --> 01:18:13,799
Can't understand.

1026
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:16,301
But the police says
it's a case of murder.

1027
01:18:16,532 --> 01:18:17,633
l see.

1028
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:20,634
Then let the law
take its own course.

1029
01:18:21,032 --> 01:18:23,200
One last question,
Mr. Subba Prasad. If Zara...

1030
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,267
Sory, l can't say
anything more right now.

1031
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:28,733
You will have to excuse me.

1032
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:36,701
Sir, that was Shyam on the phone.

1033
01:18:37,099 --> 01:18:40,435
Delhi and UP's distributors
are demanding seven more prints.

1034
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:42,267
All shows were packed yesterday.

1035
01:18:43,733 --> 01:18:47,403
Sir, don't avoid the media.

1036
01:18:48,733 --> 01:18:52,169
Propagate Zara's death
as much as you can.

1037
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:55,268
Maybe it's a second
chance for our film.

1038
01:18:56,466 --> 01:18:58,634
l've a suggestion.

1039
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:03,035
That dubbing artiste, Mamta.

1040
01:19:03,432 --> 01:19:05,734
The one that imitates heroines.

1041
01:19:06,466 --> 01:19:10,336
Let's ask her to do
a recording in Zara's voice.

1042
01:19:18,499 --> 01:19:20,067
We've Zara's last interview..

1043
01:19:20,165 --> 01:19:22,267
..which she recorded
before her suicide.

1044
01:19:22,566 --> 01:19:24,200
This recording clearly indicates..

1045
01:19:24,299 --> 01:19:28,069
..that a happy looking
Zara was quite depressed.

1046
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:29,900
Success is an obsession for me.

1047
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,533
But l am also scared..

1048
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:33,967
..that someday l might
Ieave evemhing behind.

1049
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,067
People will look for me..

1050
01:19:36,466 --> 01:19:38,367
..but there's no telling
where l would be.

1051
01:19:38,466 --> 01:19:40,267
The audience is really missing her.

1052
01:19:40,632 --> 01:19:44,168
They've made 'Ujjwal Sheetal
Nirmal' a super hit film.

1053
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:04,036
''X P O S E.. XPOSE.''

1054
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:08,402
''X P O S E.. XPOSE.''

1055
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:12,903
''X P O S E.. XPOSE.''

1056
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,537
''X P O S E.. XPOSE.''

1057
01:20:26,332 --> 01:20:30,636
''X P O S E.. XPOSE.''

1058
01:20:30,699 --> 01:20:32,867
''X P O S E..''

1059
01:20:33,099 --> 01:20:34,500
''XPOSE..''

1060
01:20:45,032 --> 01:20:45,966
Yes, Inspector.

1061
01:20:46,065 --> 01:20:47,966
Mr. Virman Shah.
- Yes.

1062
01:20:48,032 --> 01:20:49,166
We've an arrest warrant for you.

1063
01:20:51,966 --> 01:20:55,336
Bombay police has taken
film star Virman Shah in custody..

1064
01:20:55,432 --> 01:20:58,368
..in connection with
Zara Fernandes' murder.

1065
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,701
Karnik called from Arthur Road Jail.

1066
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:31,433
Grower's deputy.

1067
01:21:32,332 --> 01:21:35,635
Virman Shah had a scuffle
with the inspector.

1068
01:21:39,132 --> 01:21:40,733
He's too hot-blooded.

1069
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:44,233
l want to have a word
with Karnik after the film.

1070
01:21:46,099 --> 01:21:47,667
Virman needs me.

1071
01:21:49,466 --> 01:21:52,302
You...want to save Virman.

1072
01:21:53,866 --> 01:21:55,801
Chandni doesn't like him anymore.

1073
01:21:57,432 --> 01:21:59,066
But she did.

1074
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,001
And whatever Chandni liked..

1075
01:22:03,466 --> 01:22:05,434
..will stay invaluable for me.

1076
01:22:08,265 --> 01:22:10,467
lf l don't help that boy now..

1077
01:22:11,065 --> 01:22:12,599
..l won't be able to sleep at night.

1078
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:20,236
l love my sleep more
than l hate Virman.

1079
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:25,001
l want to meet Karnik
before leaving for Paris.

1080
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:55,671
''The pain in our
hearts could be eased.''

1081
01:22:55,733 --> 01:23:01,105
''lf only we could be one.''

1082
01:23:01,265 --> 01:23:06,436
''lf only we could be one.''

1083
01:23:06,532 --> 01:23:12,337
''The moments would've
been so wonderFul.''

1084
01:23:12,599 --> 01:23:17,704
''lf only we could be one.''

1085
01:23:18,032 --> 01:23:23,537
''lf only we could be one.''

1086
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:40,405
''The pain in our
hearts could be eased.''

1087
01:23:40,466 --> 01:23:45,704
''lf only we could be one.''

1088
01:23:45,899 --> 01:23:51,170
''lf only we could be one.''

1089
01:23:51,232 --> 01:23:56,937
''The moments would've
been so wonderFul.''

1090
01:23:57,165 --> 01:24:02,370
''lf only we could be one.''

1091
01:24:02,599 --> 01:24:07,804
''lf only we could be one.''

1092
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:12,937
''Without you there's no peace.''

1093
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:19,037
''No serenity without you.''

1094
01:24:19,299 --> 01:24:24,871
''The illusions
could've been cleared.''

1095
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:30,203
''lf only we could be one.''

1096
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:35,904
''lf only we could be one.''

1097
01:24:57,165 --> 01:25:00,134
What do l owe for this visit?

1098
01:25:05,632 --> 01:25:06,833
Love.

1099
01:25:08,165 --> 01:25:09,633
You were right.

1100
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:12,501
A man's so helpless that..

1101
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:17,970
..what's actually wrong,
feels right.

1102
01:25:23,599 --> 01:25:24,800
What happened?

1103
01:25:25,132 --> 01:25:26,066
There's been a death.

1104
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:30,300
See you.

1105
01:25:32,566 --> 01:25:35,535
That's all you came to say.

1106
01:25:36,466 --> 01:25:38,234
At least give me a name.

1107
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:44,636
The day l tell her,
you will know it too.

1108
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:14,467
Move. Move. Move back.
Move back.

1109
01:26:14,566 --> 01:26:16,134
Take him away.

1110
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:17,600
l am coming. - Yes sir.

1111
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:18,934
Malani sir.

1112
01:26:19,366 --> 01:26:21,401
During the proceedings
on Zara's murder..

1113
01:26:21,466 --> 01:26:23,100
..file charges against Virman..

1114
01:26:23,165 --> 01:26:24,766
..for obstructing
a public servant on-duty.

1115
01:26:24,866 --> 01:26:25,866
Look at this.

1116
01:26:25,933 --> 01:26:27,401
Fine, l'll look into it.

1117
01:26:34,866 --> 01:26:36,067
All rise.

1118
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:04,635
Mr. Malani, are you ready
to begin the proceedings?

1119
01:27:30,599 --> 01:27:31,666
Can l take a minute?

1120
01:27:31,733 --> 01:27:32,934
Sure.

1121
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,601
Sory to break protocol, Your Honor.

1122
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:37,733
But as an ex-police officer..

1123
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:40,268
..l would request to
be granted permission..

1124
01:27:40,733 --> 01:27:42,201
..to tell inspector
Grover something..

1125
01:27:42,265 --> 01:27:44,200
..before the court
proceedings begin..

1126
01:27:44,466 --> 01:27:46,100
..and it's vey
important for this case.

1127
01:27:46,332 --> 01:27:47,433
Objection, Your Honor.

1128
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:49,166
Only a minute.

1129
01:27:49,265 --> 01:27:50,165
You're holding the court.

1130
01:27:50,232 --> 01:27:51,600
Obliged, Your Honor.

1131
01:28:01,099 --> 01:28:04,001
Grower, l am still the same
Ravi Kumar you knew five years ago.

1132
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:07,466
l may not wear the uniform anymore..

1133
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,033
..but l am still a nutcase.

1134
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:13,167
l can still take your statement.

1135
01:28:15,232 --> 01:28:16,833
Karnik spilled evemhing.

1136
01:28:22,366 --> 01:28:24,134
Speak the truth or
you'll face the same fate..

1137
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:26,334
..as that minister in my lockup.

1138
01:28:30,065 --> 01:28:31,266
l'll clobber you to a pulp..

1139
01:28:31,332 --> 01:28:34,435
..and you'll have to
be scraped off the ground.

1140
01:28:39,699 --> 01:28:41,634
Mr. Ravi Kumar, that's enough.

1141
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:43,134
Let the proceedings begin.

1142
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:27,134
Your Honor, this case..

1143
01:29:27,466 --> 01:29:29,134
The State Vs.
Virman Shah, prime accused..

1144
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:33,968
..in the murder of actress
Zara Peter Fernandes.

1145
01:29:36,032 --> 01:29:37,133
l regret to say that..

1146
01:29:37,232 --> 01:29:40,201
..some discrepancies
have cropped up in this case.

1147
01:29:41,933 --> 01:29:46,871
ln fact at this point,
l feel the charges baseless.

1148
01:29:54,499 --> 01:29:57,568
Your Honor, we've no reason..

1149
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:03,070
..to implicate the accused
Virman Shah in Zara's death.

1150
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:05,901
Are you the prosecution
or the defense.

1151
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,301
l am sory, Your Honor.

1152
01:30:09,566 --> 01:30:11,534
But my conscience doesn't allow me..

1153
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:13,600
..to fight a case against a man..

1154
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,768
..that doesn't have
any clear evidence.

1155
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,269
lf the accused isn't guilty,
then you know who is?

1156
01:30:26,599 --> 01:30:27,766
Yes, Your Honor.

1157
01:30:30,799 --> 01:30:32,800
l would like to request inspector
Grower..

1158
01:30:33,766 --> 01:30:35,534
..to testify in front of this court.

1159
01:30:42,566 --> 01:30:44,234
We're waiting, Inspector.

1160
01:30:59,232 --> 01:31:03,569
Your Honor
we found some vita!l clues..

1161
01:31:04,165 --> 01:31:05,633
..connected to this case, and..

1162
01:31:05,699 --> 01:31:08,068
..my deputy inspector Karnik
just informed me about it.

1163
01:31:09,099 --> 01:31:13,670
This proves that...music
composer Kenny Damania..

1164
01:31:15,265 --> 01:31:17,667
..was responsible
for Zara Fernandes' death.

1165
01:31:27,766 --> 01:31:33,304
Your Honor, around mid
night Zara left the party..

1166
01:31:34,132 --> 01:31:35,566
And KD was watching her.

1167
01:31:40,099 --> 01:31:41,867
l'll just make a quick
trip to the washroom.

1168
01:31:43,366 --> 01:31:45,201
Why don't you get
yourself another drink?

1169
01:31:45,632 --> 01:31:46,833
Alright.

1170
01:31:48,099 --> 01:31:49,200
Waiter.

1171
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:06,801
Why make a big scene
in front of eveyone?

1172
01:32:08,132 --> 01:32:09,500
Now you want to fight with me?

1173
01:32:10,966 --> 01:32:12,067
Come on.

1174
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:13,833
What happened?

1175
01:32:14,265 --> 01:32:15,432
Such anger.

1176
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,000
Such anger.

1177
01:32:20,432 --> 01:32:21,900
You're such a bastard, KD.

1178
01:32:23,165 --> 01:32:25,100
Such a big pretence
only for Shabnam.

1179
01:32:26,032 --> 01:32:28,667
People were saying all
sorts of things about me.

1180
01:32:29,599 --> 01:32:31,834
And now l've a clean
image in front of Shabnam.

1181
01:32:32,265 --> 01:32:33,766
No one's going to doubt me.

1182
01:32:34,933 --> 01:32:37,135
You think you can get away from me?

1183
01:32:42,632 --> 01:32:45,234
KD.
- Oh my God, this is Shabnam.

1184
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:46,600
l don't care.

1185
01:32:48,099 --> 01:32:49,400
Come on.
- Let me go.

1186
01:32:49,466 --> 01:32:50,967
KD, are you there?
- l said let go.

1187
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:51,932
No.
- She's coming here.

1188
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,167
NO, you are not going.

1189
01:32:56,733 --> 01:32:57,733
ls that you, KD?

1190
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:58,600
No, you are not going.

1191
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:00,834
Let me go, she's coming.
- Just let go.

1192
01:33:21,466 --> 01:33:22,767
lt was just an accident.

1193
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:26,267
l admit l pushed her.

1194
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:30,866
But it wasn't intentional.

1195
01:33:32,132 --> 01:33:36,536
l only bribed inspector
Grower to change his statement.

1196
01:33:37,132 --> 01:33:39,067
Virman went after Zara.

1197
01:33:40,632 --> 01:33:42,100
Many guests saw him.

1198
01:33:43,532 --> 01:33:45,734
We can use this against him.

1199
01:33:57,165 --> 01:33:59,634
Next time don't leave such
an obvious clue at the site.

1200
01:34:04,566 --> 01:34:05,700
Thank you.

1201
01:34:09,966 --> 01:34:12,935
Sir, we can term Zara's
death as a suicide or an accident.

1202
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:15,033
Why do we have to implicate Virman?

1203
01:34:15,299 --> 01:34:16,800
Karnik,
the entire department knows..

1204
01:34:16,866 --> 01:34:19,535
..we found evidence from
the terrace Zara fell off.

1205
01:34:19,899 --> 01:34:21,300
So we need a culprit.

1206
01:34:21,599 --> 01:34:22,900
We've accepted money from KD.

1207
01:34:23,065 --> 01:34:23,999
We've got to save him.

1208
01:34:24,065 --> 01:34:25,833
But what about KD's cufflink?

1209
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,369
l've replaced that cufflink.

1210
01:34:28,766 --> 01:34:30,868
Roundup some witnesses..

1211
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:33,567
..who saw Virman Shah
heading towards the terrace.

1212
01:34:35,032 --> 01:34:36,967
Zara had an argument
with his girlfriend.

1213
01:34:37,032 --> 01:34:38,299
That threw Virman
Shah in a fit of rage.

1214
01:34:38,366 --> 01:34:39,467
And he..

1215
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:48,967
And l am sory for it.

1216
01:35:03,899 --> 01:35:05,767
ln accordance to this statement..

1217
01:35:05,966 --> 01:35:10,003
..the court will review
the accusation on Virman Shah.

1218
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,969
The court orders Kenny
Damania to be taken into custody.

1219
01:35:30,599 --> 01:35:32,567
l want to give my statement.
- Okay.

1220
01:35:34,099 --> 01:35:35,333
With the permission of the court..

1221
01:35:35,499 --> 01:35:37,400
..Mr. Ravi Kumar would
like to give his statement.

1222
01:35:38,466 --> 01:35:39,633
Granted.

1223
01:35:44,165 --> 01:35:46,200
Your Honor
whatever the court hear!d until now..

1224
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:47,800
..isn't the complete truth.

1225
01:35:50,232 --> 01:35:52,300
Facts about that
night are still hidden.

1226
01:36:00,833 --> 01:36:02,167
Being an ex-police officer.

1227
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:04,867
l've a keen sense of sight.

1228
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:09,101
The terrace from which Zara fell..

1229
01:36:09,299 --> 01:36:10,700
Had a parapet below

1230
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:14,568
Anyone falling off the
terrace would land on the parapet.

1231
01:36:15,432 --> 01:36:19,769
That's what happened with Zara,
she was saved by the parapet.

1232
01:36:21,032 --> 01:36:24,368
And then someone pushed Zara
off that parapet.

1233
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:28,500
Your Honor, l am not sure who it is.

1234
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:32,333
Could be any
of those present here.

1235
01:36:34,132 --> 01:36:35,566
With your permission, may l?

1236
01:37:56,933 --> 01:37:59,335
l think Mr.
Subba Prasad needs a glass of water.

1237
01:38:18,432 --> 01:38:20,834
Your cough has said a lot,
Mr. Subba Prasad.

1238
01:38:21,799 --> 01:38:23,300
And was it a coincidence that..

1239
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:26,702
..the room above the
parapet on which Zara fell..

1240
01:38:26,766 --> 01:38:28,134
..was booked in your name?

1241
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,402
lt's better if you
tell us what happened.

1242
01:38:50,499 --> 01:38:51,700
Zara.

1243
01:38:51,899 --> 01:38:54,101
That son of a bitch KD.

1244
01:38:54,366 --> 01:38:55,500
Come.

1245
01:38:55,699 --> 01:38:57,967
Give me your hand. - Sir. Sir.

1246
01:38:58,032 --> 01:38:59,400
Come on.

1247
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:07,133
Sir.

1248
01:39:08,232 --> 01:39:09,499
Please save.

1249
01:39:11,366 --> 01:39:12,500
Come up.

1250
01:39:22,232 --> 01:39:25,134
'Ujjwal Nirmal Sheetal'
was never a flop, Zara.

1251
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:29,269
What you couldn't accomplish,
your death will.

1252
01:39:36,265 --> 01:39:38,166
Mr. Subba Prasad is my mentor.

1253
