00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,367
Kunal.

2
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,609
Please, say something.

3
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:53,619
Look, when you're quiet,
l get very scared.

4
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:55,253
Look, lshita..

5
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,754
..l don't want to say
anything to you now.

6
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:02,417
You can do what you want? Happy?

7
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:04,862
Kunal, please. Don't say that.

8
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:06,722
No. l'm serious.

9
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:10,094
This is your life,
your career and..

10
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,203
..you're gerting married.

11
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:17,574
l've no right to interfere.

12
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,608
You do whatever you want.

13
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:24,617
You can marry anytime.

14
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:29,650
But your..
longest bridge of the world?

15
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,880
lt doesn't get build
again and again.

16
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,422
lshita,
you're a very good architect.

17
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:40,861
Go to Germany. You're needed
more there, honestly.

18
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:45,567
You can marry after
one and half year.

19
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,933
Kunal, you're gerting me wrong.

20
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,774
l mean.. l want to get married..

21
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:54,438
..only to you.

22
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:59,445
But.. you know what this
project means to me?

23
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,211
Yes.

24
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,487
And don't worry about
the wedding..

25
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,458
..arrangements made
by our parents!

26
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:09,354
These invitation cards,
booking of halls, etc..

27
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:11,790
Everything will get cancelled
with ease, right?

28
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:15,692
Kunal.

29
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:20,862
l'm not saying to cancel it,
but only to postpone it.

30
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,772
This.. this bridge construction
can't be postponed.

31
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:28,712
But we..
we can adjust this wedding.

32
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:32,542
Adjust?

33
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,581
Wedding isn't adjusted..

34
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,919
..we've to adjust other
things for wedding.

35
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,455
l'm sorry, Kunal.

36
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:41,555
l didn't mean that.

37
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:52,504
l'm sorry, Kunal.
Please take my call. l love you.

38
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,743
You know what.

39
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,481
Now we shouldn't get married.

40
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,420
What? -Honestly.

41
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,624
You should go to Germany
for one and half year.

42
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:17,830
Build the longest bridge
of the world. Enjoy it.

43
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:21,131
Kunal, if you say then l won't go.

44
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,259
Please.

45
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:28,363
Please, lshita. Don't do anything
because l say so.

46
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,536
Whatever lirtle l know you..

47
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:33,735
..you had made up your mind
even before coming here.

48
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:36,244
Thank you. -Kunal, listen.

49
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:37,814
Kunal.

50
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:51,629
lshita!
l don't want to talk to you.

51
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,422
l'm sorry, Kunal. Please listen.

52
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,661
Don't be angry like that.

53
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,760
No!
Now whatever you want will happen.

54
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:00,768
You'll go to Germany and our
wedding will be cancelled.

55
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:05,108
Kunal..

56
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,436
No!

57
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:43,815
Oh no!

58
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:17,174
Oh..

59
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,386
Hey, don't worry. l'll save you.

60
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:26,084
Don't worry! Keep your eyes open!

61
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:29,156
Talk to me. Don't sleep

62
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,186
Hi!

63
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:05,821
Are you his relative?

64
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,724
Yes.

65
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,328
l'm Kunal's fiancee.

66
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,534
Ok. Kunal is very lucky.

67
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:19,436
lf that man hadn't brought him
here at the nick of time..

68
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:20,809
..things would've been worse.

69
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,349
Doctor, where is that man?

70
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:25,811
Maybe he left.

71
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,516
But he has left his telephone
number and address.

72
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,686
You can get it from the reception.

73
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:33,749
l tried that number.

74
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:38,330
lt's wrong number and maybe..

75
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,462
..the name and address
would be wrong too.

76
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:43,761
l'm sorry.

77
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,398
Then he's an angel who
likes to do noble..

78
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:49,839
..deeds without any recognition.

79
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:53,676
Sir.

80
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:55,778
Where did that man go after all?

81
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,613
O' beloved..

82
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:33,308
..come to me..

83
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,418
Get the car!

84
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:37,714
Shut it!

85
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:23,422
No, mother. We couldn't find him.

86
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:27,125
Son Kunal,
if you find that man do thank him.

87
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,691
Yes, mother.
l too want to thank him.

88
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,829
But how could l find him? -Earlier
l thought he was coming in..

89
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:36,272
..front because of fear of police.
-But now.. l don't know..

90
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:39,209
Maybe he doesn't want
to come in front.

91
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,304
Maybe. -Listen,
son. l met aunt Ratna yesterday.

92
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:45,776
She was asking about your
and lshita's wedding.

93
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:48,882
Mother, l told you that l don't
want to get married now.

94
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,752
But listen to me, Kunal.

95
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,654
Mother, please.

96
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:55,285

97
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,305
l'll save you!

98
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,739

99
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:12,207
l'll save you! Talk to me!

100
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,269
Keep your eyes open!

101
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,372
Don't fall sleep!

102
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,917
We're almost there! Don't worry!

103
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:21,518

104
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,248

105
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:36,533

00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:38,827
Elevator is out of order!

107
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:41,806
You stay on first floor.
-Yes, son.

108

Let me help you.
-So nice of you, son.

109
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,735
Give it to me. -Thank you so much.

110
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:49,508
This watchman disappears
when you need him!

111
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:51,550
He's gerting the elevator
repaired.

112
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:54,313
l couldn't have managed
without you.

113
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:55,854
You can call me anytime for help.

114
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,624

118
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,896
Granny, l'm in a hurry.
See you later.

00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:13,299
Kunal, l make very nice cold

No. Please. Don't get it wrong..

124
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:50,199
l came to drop granny who lives
in the opposite flat.

125
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:54,777
Oh!

126
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,414
This mark is still there..

127
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,613
This mark will never fade now.

128
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:10,387
How are you? -Fine.

129
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,859
Won't you ask me how l'm?

130
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:18,868
How are you, Kunal?

131
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:22,832
lt wasn't necessary to ask,
lshita.

132
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:24,906
Kunal, please.

133
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,245
This hurts you and me as well.

134
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:31,613
Sorry, lshita. But.. -No, Kunal.
Nothing can be done now.

135
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,615
Let bygones be bygones.
-l too have forgorten everything.

136
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:37,713
And l think you should
move on too. -Move on!

00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,584
Yeah. Move on!

138
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:47,763
Finally you're going.

Ok.

142
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,512
Bye! -Bye.

143
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:08,818
Elevator is out of order!

144
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:11,484
Oh!

145
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:43,786
Sir! Excuse me.

146
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,483

What's your problem?

152
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:59,396
Sir, l've been calling you for
long but you just don't listen.

153
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,368
What do you want?
-You didn't recognize me?

154
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,733
Why? Are you a film star?

155
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,610
No. 3 months ago you had
taken me to a hospital.

156
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:13,243
That.. accident. l was
on highway.. Kunal..

-Sir, l live in that building.

-Why?

162
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,832
Sir, that night you didn't give
your right number and address.

163
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:32,530
Name was wrong too.
You can't be Satish, right?

164
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:34,533
Why not?

165
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,502
lt's possible.
-That's is right. -But it isn't.

166
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,772
My name is Raghu.

167
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:45,913

Just a minute.

188
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,121
Yes?

189
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,184

Oh God..

00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:36,259
Sorry.

201
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,194
These workers.. l'm a contractor.

202
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,367
Workers don't understand

203
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,431
l understand.
lt happens in companies.

204
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:49,497
We've to be firm while
talking to workers.

205
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:51,776
Rohit. Come here.

206
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:55,805

..but you saved him?

215

Sir,

225
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,385
Ok, bye. Best of luck to me.

00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:46,124
He's like that only.

00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,495

No.. -Seriously, sir.

237
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:31,537
Do you see this mark?

238
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:39,342
lt will remind me that l'm alive
today only because of you.

239
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,951
Sir.

240

l know that it's not possible
for me to repay your favors.

241
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:52,458
But.. if you l could do anything

Ok, fine.
But l don't want anything.

Please, sir. Don't say that.

245
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:02,366
lf you need time to think,

246
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:05,808
No. Look. l'll.. l don't
want anything now.

247
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:08,676
You called me here and served me

00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,612

-No, sir. Ok.. ok..

249
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:12,617
l want to say one last thing.

00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,744

You've said it enough.

251
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,651
l've to go now. -Sir.

252
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:21,557

254
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,195
Ok. l'll do that.

255

This is my card with
my phone number.

256
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,701
This is my mobile number
and email address.

257
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,500
You can mail me anytime.

258
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,607
And you know my house too.

259
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,333
So are we friends now?

260
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,713
Friend? Yes, sir. Friends.

261
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:45,780
We're friends?
You can come here anytime.

262
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:49,751
l'll go now.

263
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,652
Sir Raghu..
thank you very much, once again.

264
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:00,824
Tea was nice.

265
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,519
The policy plan you told me had
18 percent allocation fee.

266
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:29,694
Other companies are charging
15 percent.

267
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:30,919
Not at all, sir.

268
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:34,326
Maybe you think our 18 percent
fee is too much.

269
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,361
But our company has no hidden
charges like other companies.

270
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,572
Hidden charges? -Yes, sir.

271
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:45,741
Show me. Come on. Show me.

272
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:55,177
Got it?

273
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:00,518
Sir,
actually they're hidden charges.

274
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,727
lt isn't visible so easily.
-Oh, really?

275
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:11,498
Ajay, l had high hopes from you.

276
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,671
But..
you've not only disappointed me..

277
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:15,639
..but you've wasted
my precious time.

278
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,142
Ah.. sir. -l've to go.

279
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,734
Please, sir.
Sorry. Excuse me, sir.

280
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:21,904
Please let me explain
you in details once.

281
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,240
There is a difference
between selling..

282
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:25,874
..insurance and incense stick.

283
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:28,779
Sir, please. Sir.

284
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,549
Oh no! Oh no, man!

285
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:34,224
l was after this man
for two months..

286
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,118
..to take 10 minutes of his time.

287
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:38,161
You ruined everything
in 3 minutes.

288
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,460
Friend Ajay..
-This isn't the first time, Kunal.

289
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,392
Oh no! -Come on, Ajay.
l'm sorry, Kunal.

290
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,434
Find another partner.. -Ajay..

291
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,747
lt ended so soon?

292
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:02,184
Oh!

293
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,517
Come. You're back home soon.

294
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,851
Look at the scene!

295
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:12,725
Brother! All is well?

296
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,312
Rohit, where is food?

297
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:31,747
lt's over.

298
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:35,811
Over? What do you mean?

299
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:40,120
My friend had come here.
He tasted my food..

300
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:44,159
..and he liked it so much that
he ate entire dinner.

301
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:47,561
Nothing was left for me?
-He eats like a pig!

302
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,859
l didn't know he'll eat
everything! That glurton!

303
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,166
Order pizza for yourself.

304
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,890
Hey!
Bring some biscuits for me too.

305
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:21,462
Here! Eat it.

306
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,461
We won't eat so much.

307
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,570
Who is it? Get the door!

308
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,889
Oh God! Sir, what to you?

309
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:51,459
Sir! Blood..

310
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,199
Sir! What happened to you?

311
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,663
Turn off the TV! -Ok.

312
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:07,641
Sir, what happened?

313
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:27,259
Oh God!

314
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:33,265
Kunal, turn on the light.

315
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,406
Turn on the light. -Do it!

316
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:51,720
Water..

317
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:53,784
Water? -Water.

318
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:56,259
Rohit, bring water. -Yes.

319
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:04,600
Sir, that.. what happened to you?
-Nothing. Water..

320
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:06,202
Bring water. -Here.

321
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:08,100
Sir, have some water.

322
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:10,501
Careful..

323
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,542
Sir, careful..

324
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:16,077
Sir, take this.

325
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:19,340
Oh.. -Sorry, sir.

326
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,312
You're bleeding profusely, sir.

327
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:29,724
l'll call the police.
-Are you a fool?

328
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:33,160
l don't want police. -Why?

329
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,292
l'm shot here.. -Oh no!

330
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:38,902
lf police sees me,
they'll kill me.

331
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:40,695
But why will the police shoot me?

332
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:43,801
Police too is involved in it.
-Why did you come here?

333
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,867
What are you saying? -Shut up!

334
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:47,877
Where else could l've gone?

335
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:49,910
No, sir. You did the right thing.

336
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:53,273
l'll leave in some time.
-Don't worry, sir. l'm with you.

337
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:56,487
Are you sure? -Are you mad, Rohit?

338
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:59,151
Where can he go?

339
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:01,359
l'll go. -Don't say that, sir.

340
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:05,160
Kunal..
Kunal, l want to talk to you.

341
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:08,098
Wait. Sir.. -Please come.

342
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,166
Kunal.

343
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,670
Sir.. l'll be back.

344
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,340
Are you mad? Who is he?

345
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:19,536
l already told you he didn't
seem to be a nice guy, but..

346
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:20,805
Talk softly. He might hear you.

347
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:23,109
People are chasing him!
Do you know anything about them?

348
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:25,706
Rohit, he'll leave soon.
Let him stay for some time.

349
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:27,342
What if he doesn't leave?

350
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,683
The men after him will come home.
What then?

351
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:31,814
Let me be very clear
and frank with you!

352
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:34,487
You might like to die,
but l don't.

353
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,260
Come on, Rohit.
Nothing will happen.

354
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,591
Forget who he's.

355
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:43,834
Friend, when he saved me he
didn't think who l was.

356
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:46,370
Oh, please. Stop this lecture
about saving your life.

357
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:48,903
Tell him to leave or l'll
call the police.

358
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:53,339
Rohit, but.. -Are you telling
him to leave or not?

359
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:56,438
l'm asking for the last time.
What did you decide?

360
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:59,775
Rohit, why don't you understand?
-Hello. What?

361
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:02,186
Fine. Don't listen to me.

362
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:04,745
You won't understand.

363
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:09,623
Rohit! You don't need to phone.

364
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:17,234
Hello. Doctor Bose?

365
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:19,795
Yes. There is an emergency!

366
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:36,812
Why are those men after you?

367
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:41,724
lt's nothing. There was some
problem at the site.

368
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:59,368
Come.
l was waiting for you. Come in.

369
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,708
Uncle.. -Put him down there.

370
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:04,373
Carefully.

371
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:09,181
Sit carefully.

372
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:13,184
Oh God! -Sorry.

373
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,387
My God..

374
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:20,590
How did this accident happen?
-l lied to you.

375
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,598
Actually he has been shot dead.
-What?

376
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:26,227
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

377
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,397
Then you wouldn't have
let me come here.

378
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:32,471
This is police case.
Go to the police station.

379
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:41,444
What are you thinking? -How much?

380
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,582
50,000.

381
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:45,915
20,000.

382
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:49,591
Are you bargaining?

383
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:54,394
l said 20,000.
Or else l'll leave him here.

384
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:56,331
Hey, wait.

385
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,201
Ok.

386
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,368
20,000 rupees is fine.

387
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:04,239
But on two conditions.

388
00:31:04,643 --> 00:31:09,205
First, after the operation
you both will leave.

389
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:14,680
And in future,
if anything happens to him..

390
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:18,388
..l'm not responsible.

391
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:10,369
Ok, so he's the same man who
took you to hospital.

392
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:12,239
Yes, doctor. -Good.

393
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,350
Take these tablets.

394
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:33,423
Give him 2 tablets after
every 2 hours.

395
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,525
This will alleviate his pain.

396
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:49,442
Uncle, l've only this much now.

397
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:51,574
200.

398
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:55,946
200. Joking?

399
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:58,949
Go. l've done it free.

400
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,320
Go now. lt's for free.

401
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:07,765

Take him carefully.

00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,342
Thank you, sir.

405
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,915

Thank you. Thank you.

409
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:59,241
Because of me,
you faced lots of trouble.

410
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,785
No. Don't say that. Please.

411
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,149

412
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,836
Don't worry.

413
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:22,867

414
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:26,335
Ok? Don't worry!

415
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:31,905
Bye. -lt's ok.

418
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:15,842
Why did you stop the car?
-Sir, it stopped all of a sudden.

419
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:18,582
My legs slipped from the brake.
-Show me the license!

421
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,377

You made this mistake, Pakiya.

00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:52,303
Look,
nobody is shot for no reason.

536
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:55,475
So many are trying to kill you.

537
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,804
You must've done something.

538
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:02,647
Sir, until you don't tell me
the truth, l can't help you.

539
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:10,250
And.. if l tell the truth,
will you help me?

540
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:13,587
Huh? -Yes.

541
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:17,491
l'll help you.
At least l'll try to help.

542
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:21,669
Look, l don't think you had
any fight at your site.

543
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:24,605
This is something else. Correct?

544
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:28,106
Yes. There is no site to fight.

545
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:35,084
Do you know him?

546
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:38,220
Dada Bhosale.

547
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:41,890
He's a big senator!

548
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:44,751
Yes. So?

549
00:49:44,828 --> 00:49:48,423
l got news that Dada Bhosale
was going to temple today.

550
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:57,265
Look,
he's the only chance to kill Dada.

551
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:00,472
l don't want any mistake
this time.

552
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:03,676
But l didn't know that mistake
was already made.

553
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,657
Oh..

554
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:33,903
And then?

555
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:52,557
Shoot him!

556
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:02,772
Ah.. Dada..

557
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:04,864
Dada.. Jeetu!

558
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,772
Jeetu!

559
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:12,306
Brother.. -Take Dada to hospital.

560
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,377
Tell Rahul to send more men.

561
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:19,217
Dada, l'm with you. Don't worry.

562
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:20,586
Take him quickly!

563
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:21,919
Yes.

564
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,464
Brother, look here.

565
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,711
l fled to save my life!

566
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:48,551
They weren't going to spare me!

567
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,745
Pakiya knew about all my dens!

568
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:55,314
l was looking for a hiding place.

569
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,323
Suddenly l found myself in
front of your building.

570
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:02,192
l'm not a contractor.

571
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:06,762
l'm a gangster and
a contract killer!

572
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:36,564
What will you do now?

573
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:06,456
Brother..
-Everything will be fine!

574
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:10,232
Brother..

575
00:53:12,703 --> 00:53:14,193
l won't spare anyone.

576
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:16,362
Did you find out who did this?

577
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:19,437
Raghu!

578
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:23,603
He was with Patkar.
Dada had removed him!

579
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:30,517
That scoundrel.. Mohite must've
given the contract to kill!

580
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:43,391
Did you find Raghu?
-We'll find him.

581
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:47,801
My men are scouring
the entire area.

582
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:53,242
Boss..

583
00:53:55,913 --> 00:53:57,244
Boss..

584
00:53:59,216 --> 00:54:00,740
Don't worry.

585
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:05,645
l won't let you die.

586
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:09,853
l'll kill that Raghu
in front of you.

587
00:54:11,528 --> 00:54:13,291
l'll remove his guts..

588
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:15,696
Then l'll blow his brains.

589
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:20,700
Boss!

590
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:25,435
Boss! You've to do lots of work.

591
00:54:27,644 --> 00:54:28,906
Ah..

592
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,404
We've to make you chief minister.

593
00:54:33,383 --> 00:54:35,374
Then we'll see who interferes.

594
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:38,754
Do you hear me?

595
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:41,923
Boss!

596
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:45,818
This is Pakiya.

597
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:49,163
Boss!

598
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:52,659
Boss!

599
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:07,542
Hi. Thanks for coming.

600
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:11,377
What happened, Kunal?
-l'll tell you later.

601
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:13,350
Did you bring clothes? -Yes.

602
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:15,788
Here.

603
00:55:28,305 --> 00:55:29,499
l'm sorry, Raghu.

604
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:33,809
But now l can't help you.

605
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:38,306
l wish you hadn't done that..

606
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:39,781
Then l wouldn't have come to you.

607
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:43,176
Yes, but..

608
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:47,787
You don't worry!
l won't tell anyone.

609
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:52,326
l'm sorry, Raghu.

610
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:04,865
Let's go.
-Won't that man come with us?

611
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:07,171
No. Drive!

612
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:28,011
Mohite.

613
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:31,952
He knows that if Dada contests
election for MLA..

614
00:56:32,023 --> 00:56:33,388
..his career is finished.

615
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:49,029
You both were present when
Dada was artacked.

616
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,608
Who artacked him?

617
00:56:53,478 --> 00:56:54,945
Hey.. Jeetu. Answer me.

618
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:58,509
l don't know.

619
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:01,077
l don't know.

620
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,745
Police found two bodies
on the bridge.

621
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,855
Where are the licenses
of your gun?

622
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:10,394
Mr. Sawant,
why are you wasting your time?

623
00:57:11,129 --> 00:57:12,187
We'll handle it.

624
00:57:12,831 --> 00:57:15,698
l know what you're thinking.

625
00:57:16,635 --> 00:57:18,500
Listen to me.

626
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,798
This is my area.

627
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,772
lf anyone tries to break the law..

628
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,141
..it won't be good for you.

629
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:27,439
l'm warning you. Got it?

630
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,114
Hey.. you two stay here.

631
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:33,681
l want report. -Ok, sir.

632
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,150
Mr. Sawant.

633
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,392
Have you ever been to Ghadchiroli?

634
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:51,625
Four times. l'm still ready to go.

635
00:58:04,082 --> 00:58:06,573
Who was that man?

636
00:58:11,723 --> 00:58:13,156
lshita, tell me something.

637
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:15,651
lf a man saves your life..

638
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:18,051
..and you thank him..

639
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:22,699
..but if he comes
to you for help..

640
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:24,899
..when his own life is in danger..

641
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:28,672
..then will you save his life?

642
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,507
Of course.

643
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,968
At least l'll try my best.

644
00:58:33,044 --> 00:58:35,535
No, lshita.
Anyone will try to do that.

645
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:38,582
l'm asking, how far can you
go to save his life?

646
00:58:39,017 --> 00:58:41,645
Meaning? -l mean,
you're not related to that man.

647
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:46,020
Neither kin or friend,
but he just saved your life once..

648
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,892
..and today you've go
a chance for Payback.

649
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,788
And you try your best..

650
00:58:52,063 --> 00:58:55,123
..but how long?
When will you say it's enough?

651
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,766
lt's too much?
-But why will l say that?

652
00:58:58,436 --> 00:59:00,495
And..
what do you mean by 'How far'?

653
00:59:01,172 --> 00:59:06,041
l may not do anything illegal
to save his life, but..

654
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,478
..but l can go to any limits.

655
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:15,442
lshita,
even if that man isn't a good man?

656
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:19,953
Kunal, the man who saved
my life can't be bad.

657
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:23,561
After all l'm alive because
of him, right?

658
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:34,530
Was he the same man..

659
00:59:35,106 --> 00:59:37,370
..who admirted you in hospital?

660
00:59:39,511 --> 00:59:41,035
lshita, turn around.

661
00:59:41,112 --> 00:59:43,137
What happened? -Turn around.
Fast. Please.

662
00:59:54,025 --> 00:59:55,617
Who is asking for lift?

663
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:00,463
Stop! Nab him!

664
01:00:10,475 --> 01:00:11,942
Nab him!

665
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,807
Kill him!

666
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,607
You shot our boss!

667
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:23,549
lshita! -You shot our boss!

668
01:00:23,855 --> 01:00:26,653
lshita! -Kunal, who are they?

669
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:29,818
lshita! Turn the car around.
-But, Kunal.. -lshita, fast!

670
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:35,392
That's enough!
Pakiya will deal with him.

671
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,531
Take him along. -Come on!

672
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:40,133
Who are they, Kunal?
Why were they hirting that man?

673
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:42,032
Payback! You've to do it!

674
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:44,700
lshita, is there anything rod
or something in the car?

675
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,501
No! Why?

676
01:00:47,512 --> 01:00:48,774
Kunal!

677
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:57,413
Look, lshita! Don't get scared!

678
01:00:57,922 --> 01:00:59,856
Look, l've never done this before!

679
01:00:59,924 --> 01:01:02,358
But you don't worry!
l won't let any harm come to you.

680
01:01:02,427 --> 01:01:04,952
And.. if anything happens,
you should flee!

681
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:07,054
Yes, but..
-Ok. -What do we've to do?

682
01:01:23,381 --> 01:01:25,076
You shot boss!

683
01:01:27,952 --> 01:01:29,749
Why are you staring!

684
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:31,948
l'll shot you right here!

685
01:01:35,627 --> 01:01:37,561
Look ahead, kid!

686
01:01:40,365 --> 01:01:42,799
Hey smarty! Why are you looking

687
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,601
Get lost! You're gay!

688
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:59,015
l said look ahead!

689
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:00,907
Hey!

690
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:34,711

01:02:35,353 --> 01:02:37,947
lshita! Every! Are you fine?

692

Are you hurt?

693
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,962
Raghu! Raghu!

694
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:53,434
Raghu! Raghu! Are you all right?

695
01:02:53,638 --> 01:02:55,128
Yes.. -Careful!

696
01:02:57,542 --> 01:02:58,941
Careful!

697
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,608
You fool!

698
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:27,667
Raghu! Are you fine?

699
01:03:28,406 --> 01:03:30,533
Yes! -Hey..

700
01:03:40,752 --> 01:03:42,982
Every! lshita!

701
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:46,416
lshita!
l told you to say in the car.

702
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:49,583
Kunal, but l saw they were..

703
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:52,125
Are you mad? What is something
had happened to you?

704
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:24,791
Why did you return?

705
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,392
Should l've returned?

706
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:32,093
She told you return, right?

707
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,768
Huh?

708
01:04:40,011 --> 01:04:42,502
Kunal, who were they?

709
01:04:43,114 --> 01:04:45,378
And.. why are they after him?

710
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:48,010
They were.. -lshita!

711
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:51,784

712
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:55,717
Raghu! -Yes.

713
01:04:56,627 --> 01:04:59,460
Now tell me, where should l

714
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:02,457
What do you mean by that?
-l don't know.

715
01:05:02,533 --> 01:05:04,364
Oh God..

716
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:10,536
Ok,
we'll leave you out of the city!

717
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:14,037
You can go anywhere from there.

718
01:05:14,112 --> 01:05:17,513
My work isn't finished yet.
l've to take my money.

719
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:22,747
Then where? -l don't know.

720
01:05:28,526 --> 01:05:31,324
lshita! -Kunal, quiet!

721
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:33,425
Be quiet! -But, lshita.

722
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,727
lt's burning.. -Kunal, look ahead.

723
01:05:37,802 --> 01:05:39,667
Or else you'll have
an accident again.

724
01:05:40,705 --> 01:05:42,332
Lady doctor..

725
01:05:46,844 --> 01:05:48,903
Get up!
Did you come here to sleep?

726
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,607
No, sir. -ldiot!

727
01:05:51,983 --> 01:05:53,678
Shinde! -Yes, sir?

728
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:55,048
Show me the FlR?

729
01:05:56,587 --> 01:05:57,713
Which one?

730
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:01,684
The FlR about the artack
on Dada Bhosale!

731
01:06:02,093 --> 01:06:03,822
Sir,
but we've not made FlR of that.

732
01:06:07,498 --> 01:06:08,522
Why?

733
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:09,723
Oh no!

734
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:12,660
Kunal, have you gone mad?

735
01:06:13,538 --> 01:06:16,507
You called me so late in
the night for this man?

736
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:19,866
For this man you messed
with those goons?

737
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:21,578
For this man?

738
01:06:21,879 --> 01:06:23,972
What was the need
to take him home?

739
01:06:24,582 --> 01:06:26,675
But l didn't know
who this man was.

740
01:06:26,751 --> 01:06:30,448
And.. you told me that you
can go to any limits.

741
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,588
So we came back!

742
01:06:32,657 --> 01:06:33,851
Kunal, l said so.

743
01:06:33,925 --> 01:06:35,756
But isn't this too much?

744
01:06:36,027 --> 01:06:38,120
Ok, everything else is fine..

745
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:41,126
..but killing someone for money?

746
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:43,560
lt's like helping the underworld.

747
01:06:43,634 --> 01:06:45,397
lshita, but what could l've done?

748
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,071
He was asking for my help!
How could l shut my door on him?

749
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:52,167
l should refuse this man
who saved my life.

750
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,469
Kunal,
aren't you gerting too emotional?

751
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,013
What you did was right, but..

752
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:59,379
..you too can get in
trouble by that.

753
01:07:00,418 --> 01:07:02,852
lt's easy for Raghu!
He can flee! -lshita.

754
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:05,048
But where will you go?

755
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,514
l mean.. where will we go?

756
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:11,925
What should l do? l should
hand Raghu to those goons.

757
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:14,758
So that they can kill him. -No!

758
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,533
Then?

759
01:07:18,603 --> 01:07:19,865
There is one more way.

760
01:07:24,675 --> 01:07:26,802
No, Patil. l'm telling you..

761
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:28,936
..firing was at Andheri Bridge..

762
01:07:29,013 --> 01:07:30,776
..so that FlR is report.

763
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:33,412
We've evidences too.

764
01:07:33,484 --> 01:07:36,612
We got two dead bodies,
one Sumo car and bullets.

765
01:07:36,887 --> 01:07:40,948
We found tyre marks of other
car and glass pieces..

766
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:43,653
..which will make Dada
Bhosale's car.

767
01:07:45,463 --> 01:07:46,691
On whose order?

768
01:07:48,966 --> 01:07:52,094
Look, transfer that FlR
to my police station.

769
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:54,694
Or else l'll talk to commissioner.

770
01:07:55,373 --> 01:07:56,772
l'm not threatening you.

771
01:07:57,475 --> 01:08:01,138
Let me tell you, l'm not scared
of transfer to Ghadchiroli.

772
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:04,972
Sir.

773
01:08:06,117 --> 01:08:08,711
What? -Please come out
and see for yourself.

774
01:08:23,134 --> 01:08:24,897
Where did you find him?

775
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:28,500
Sir.. we found him on the road.

776
01:08:28,706 --> 01:08:32,642
Some people were after him!
They fled on seeing our car.

777
01:08:32,877 --> 01:08:35,004
He was injured so we
brought him here.

778
01:08:35,646 --> 01:08:37,511
Hey.. come out.

779
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:42,984
Hey.. come out!

780
01:08:49,026 --> 01:08:50,891
Get him out! -Ok, sir.

781
01:08:57,902 --> 01:08:59,164
Come out!

782
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:03,436

783
01:09:06,844 --> 01:09:08,869
Hey.. what's your name?

784
01:09:10,548 --> 01:09:11,845
What's your name?

785
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,709
Do you know him? -No, sir.

786
01:09:15,753 --> 01:09:17,414
But we'll know him by morning.

787
01:09:17,855 --> 01:09:19,720
First take him to the hospital.
Go!

788
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,314
Hey, go with him!

789
01:09:21,959 --> 01:09:23,654
Take him to the hospital.

790
01:09:26,464 --> 01:09:27,590
This..

791
01:09:29,066 --> 01:09:30,829
How did you get hurt?

792
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:36,903
Sir, it's because of me!

793
01:09:38,776 --> 01:09:40,937
You've to give statement! -What?

794
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:44,141
No, not about that.
But l've to take your statement..

795
01:09:44,382 --> 01:09:46,407
Bring them in. Come on. -Come!

796
01:10:11,976 --> 01:10:14,467
Fine. Now you can leave!

797
01:10:15,613 --> 01:10:17,444
Thank you, Mr. Sawant.

798
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:21,316
Please take care of him.

799
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:23,781
He..

800
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:27,620
His life is in danger.

801
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:31,927
Why are you so worried?

802
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,823
Do you know him? -No.

803
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:39,091
We were just scared as
he was badly hurt..

804
01:10:41,472 --> 01:10:43,633
Don't worry.
Now he's in police custody.

805
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:45,436
We'll take care of everything.

806
01:10:50,548 --> 01:10:51,776
This is my card.

807
01:10:54,385 --> 01:10:57,877
lf there is any problem,
just give me a call. Ok?

808
01:10:58,656 --> 01:11:00,624
Thank you. -Thank you, sir.

809
01:11:07,498 --> 01:11:09,090
Shinde! -Yes, sir.

810
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,592
What do you think?
-Something is wrong.

811
01:11:30,588 --> 01:11:31,850
lshita!

812
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,790
Thank you.. for everything.

813
01:11:36,894 --> 01:11:39,488
Kunal, l'm really proud of you.

814
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:40,654
Come on.

815
01:11:40,731 --> 01:11:43,894
Had you been in my place,
you would've done the same. Right?

816
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:47,536
No. Not at all!

817
01:11:48,506 --> 01:11:50,030
Only you can do this.

818
01:11:50,441 --> 01:11:51,931
l had told you even before..

819
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,573
..you're too good..
more than needed.

820
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:56,473
So what's wrong?

821
01:11:58,349 --> 01:12:01,648
Anything is bad when it
extends the limits.

822
01:12:02,553 --> 01:12:04,885
Ok. Good night.

823
01:12:05,589 --> 01:12:06,749
Good night.

824
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:02,038
So you're, Kunal The Hero!

825
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:05,542
Nice title for a movie, right?

826
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:14,882
What? Are you scared now?

827
01:13:20,431 --> 01:13:21,557
You came alone.

828
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,827
Where is your girl friend?

829
01:13:25,336 --> 01:13:26,928
She lives on the first floor,
right?

830
01:13:27,004 --> 01:13:29,063
Hey.. -Brother? -Bring her here.

831
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:33,672
Don't get furious.
She'll come here.

832
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:36,512
This..

833
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:40,315
He told me everything.

834
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:42,484
He's a coward.

835
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:44,749
He's not like you.

836
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,582
Tell me..

837
01:13:48,959 --> 01:13:50,358
Where is he? -Who?

838
01:13:52,496 --> 01:13:56,398
You fool! Don't act smart.

839
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:00,426
Have l been playing hide
and seek for hours?

840
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:03,103
Tell me! Where is he? -Raghu!

841
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:05,838
He.. he's in police custody.

842
01:14:06,377 --> 01:14:09,676
Are you fooling me?
-l'm telling you the truth.

843
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,980
l handed him to the police.

844
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,715
Police will punish him!

845
01:14:16,086 --> 01:14:18,020
Only l'll punish him!

846
01:14:18,689 --> 01:14:20,384
That too in front
of Dada and Bhau!

847
01:14:21,058 --> 01:14:25,017
As for your police..
to hell with them!

848
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,324
Tell me, where is he?

849
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,098
lshita! No!

850
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,426
Leave her, scum!

851
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,531
lshita! -What did you say?

852
01:14:34,772 --> 01:14:36,569
Look, leave her..

853
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:39,737
Tie him up! -l'm warning you.

854
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,568
lshita!

855
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:48,077
Please leave her! -Tie him up.

856
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:57,787
Your coward friend told
me why you saved Raghu.

857
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:01,359
You've lots of guts. Come on!

858
01:15:02,032 --> 01:15:03,465
Save your Raghu!

859
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:08,563
But listen, Raghu's death
warrant has been issued.

860
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:24,052
No! -Listen.

861
01:15:26,724 --> 01:15:30,717
Decide fast? Will you save
your lowly Raghu or..

862
01:15:31,462 --> 01:15:32,793
..your girl friend?

863
01:15:33,464 --> 01:15:34,863
Call on her mobile phone.

864
01:15:35,466 --> 01:15:37,297
l'll kill the one you chose.

865
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:40,431
Hey, take her along! -Come on.

866
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:42,604
lshita! lshita!

867
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:10,032
Shinde! l'm telling you..

868
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:21,009
..Raghu, wake up!

869
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,903
Hey, Raghu! Get up.

870
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,016
Doctor..

871
01:16:31,522 --> 01:16:33,922
Which weapon has hurt him?

872
01:16:34,525 --> 01:16:35,787
He has been shot!

873
01:16:40,497 --> 01:16:42,055
Are you sure? -Yes.

874
01:16:42,533 --> 01:16:44,933
But the bullet was removed before
he was brought here.

875
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,142
Excuse me! Excuse me!

876
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:33,039
What is it?
-Police has admirted a man here.

877
01:17:33,116 --> 01:17:34,140
Yes. -Raghu.

878
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:35,715
Yes. -Where is he?

879
01:17:35,786 --> 01:17:38,550
Doctor,
how many hours before was he shot?

880
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:40,382
Around 4-5 hours ago.

881
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:43,653
4-5 hours. -Yes?

882
01:17:44,795 --> 01:17:47,161
Thank you, doctor.
-You're most welcome, sir.

883
01:18:19,463 --> 01:18:21,021
Hey.. come here.

884
01:18:29,373 --> 01:18:31,398
Give me more..

885
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:34,634
Sir, you..

886
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:38,772
Yes, actually when l went home l
learnt my cousin had an accident.

887
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:40,815
He was admirted here too.

888
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:42,852
l met Mr. Sawant downstairs.

889
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,388
l thought of meeting that man too.

890
01:18:45,455 --> 01:18:47,389
Ok. -How is he?

891
01:18:47,457 --> 01:18:49,721

Look, l came to help.

Are you here to save
me or kill me?

We'll decide that later.

905
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:46,415

Nobody.. She was lshita! Look.

935
01:24:16,686 --> 01:24:18,483
Why did you save me again?

01:24:18,788 --> 01:24:21,689
What do you mean.. you know why?

937
01:24:23,593 --> 01:24:25,925
Do you think l'm mad?

938
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:30,493
You handed me to the police and
then you helped me escape!

939
01:24:31,001 --> 01:24:33,333
Are you toying with me? -No.

Pakiya has kidnapped lshita!

946
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:56,058
Ok.. saving me was just a sham!

947
01:24:56,826 --> 01:24:59,818
You'll get me killed to save your
girl friend. -Stop the car. -No!

948
01:24:59,896 --> 01:25:02,592
Stop it! -No! -Stop the car. -No!

No, Raghu! Raghu!

957
01:25:33,596 --> 01:25:35,757
How long can you run!

958
01:25:38,435 --> 01:25:40,562
Raghu! Stop!

959
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:47,706
Stop!

960
01:25:55,118 --> 01:25:56,449
lf you had to do this..

961
01:25:56,519 --> 01:25:58,487
..why did you open the
door the first time?

962
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,627
Stop it, you scum!

963
01:26:13,103 --> 01:26:15,663
Stop!

964
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:20,138
l shouldn't have opened the door?

965
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:21,634
Who began this?

966
01:26:22,512 --> 01:26:25,777
lf you hadn't saved my life,
this wouldn't have happened.

967
01:26:26,082 --> 01:26:30,416
lf l hadn't saved your life,
you would've been dead today.

968
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,543
Brother.. brother..

969
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:03,517
Brother, Dada..

970
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:05,952
Dada is no more!

971
01:27:21,738 --> 01:27:23,865
Dada!

972
01:27:45,862 --> 01:27:47,830
l don't want to die!

973
01:27:48,965 --> 01:27:50,728
l don't want to die!

974
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,097
Sorry, Raghu.

975
01:27:54,838 --> 01:27:58,433
But without you,
l can't save lshita.

976
01:28:01,811 --> 01:28:03,540
Phone is ringing.

977
01:28:17,827 --> 01:28:19,454
Hello! -Raghu!

978
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:21,095

01:28:30,006 --> 01:28:33,840
Listen.
Don't phone again on this number.

983
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:43,947
Whose phone was it?

984
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:48,749
What difference does it make?

985
01:28:52,362 --> 01:28:53,727
The one who gave the contract..

986
01:28:53,963 --> 01:28:55,726
Gave you contract.. who?

987
01:28:56,165 --> 01:28:59,931
l don't know.
l take the money and kill people.

988
01:29:00,803 --> 01:29:04,933
Now that Dada Bhosale is dead,
he called me to take the money.

989
01:29:27,664 --> 01:29:29,063
Kunal!

990
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,497
You can still save me!

991
01:29:32,569 --> 01:29:35,697
You're trapped in the vicious
circle of the crime world.

992
01:29:35,872 --> 01:29:38,864
Now death awaits you
in every corner.

993
01:29:39,409 --> 01:29:42,037
There is nobody you can trust.

994
01:29:42,679 --> 01:29:45,944
You're a pawn in this maze.

995
01:29:52,922 --> 01:29:56,050
Live your life to
the fullest here.

996
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:59,617
Don't hesitate to drink too.

997
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:05,699
Your luck is shining,

lf you're scared,
you're as good as dead.

1001
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:21,675
Come and live your life.

1002
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:29,557
That man will come himself
to give the money.

1003
01:30:30,326 --> 01:30:31,588
No.

1004
01:30:40,069 --> 01:30:43,038
What are you doing?
-l'm taking your place.

1005
01:30:47,744 --> 01:30:51,646
Come and live in present.

1006
01:30:54,651 --> 01:30:58,781
Don't move back no marter what.

1007
01:31:01,557 --> 01:31:04,856

..it can you on the
path of death.

Brace yourself, don't sigh..

01:31:16,873 --> 01:31:19,865
..taste the nectar

1012
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:23,537
lf you're scared,
you're as good as dead.

1013
01:31:23,613 --> 01:31:27,515
Come and live in present.

1014
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:30,685
Excuse me, sir. Your order please.

1015
01:31:33,589 --> 01:31:35,079
One white rum with orange juice.

1016
01:31:42,432 --> 01:31:46,732
Come and embrace me.

l wait for you impatiently.

1018
01:31:56,112 --> 01:31:59,138
These lips crave for you.

l was to sway in your arms.

1020
01:32:02,852 --> 01:32:06,379
Come and live in present.

1021
01:32:07,924 --> 01:32:11,360
Brace yourself, don't sigh..

1022
01:32:11,427 --> 01:32:14,658
..taste the nectar
when you're here.

1023
01:32:14,731 --> 01:32:18,132
lf you're scared,
you're as good as dead.

1024
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:22,098
Come and live in present.

1025
01:32:29,912 --> 01:32:31,072
Excuse me.

1026
01:32:35,718 --> 01:32:37,481
Give this to the one
who gave this.

1027
01:32:43,793 --> 01:32:46,956
You're trapped in the vicious
circle of the crime world.

1028
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:50,497
Now death awaits you
in every corner.

1029
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,863
There is nobody you can trust.

1030
01:32:54,036 --> 01:32:57,369
You're a pawn in this maze.

1031
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,072
Where are you going?
-There is one more way out.

1032
01:33:22,665 --> 01:33:23,893
How much is it?

1033
01:33:25,368 --> 01:33:26,528
10.

1034
01:33:27,637 --> 01:33:30,105
10 lakh? -Yes.

1035
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:35,910
l won't get 10 lakh even if l
insure thousands of people.

1036
01:33:36,813 --> 01:33:38,906
And you get 10 lakh for
killing one man.

1037
01:33:39,415 --> 01:33:40,973
lt's the system, dear.

1038
01:33:45,688 --> 01:33:47,087
What will you do with this money?

1039
01:33:48,925 --> 01:33:52,122
l've to be alive to do anything.

1040
01:33:57,733 --> 01:34:03,330
Raghu. lf our plan succeeds,
you can escape.

1041
01:34:07,777 --> 01:34:09,642
Why are you doing all this for me?

1042
01:34:11,047 --> 01:34:14,505
To save me are you
gerting any money?

1043
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:16,543
No.

1044
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:18,143
Then?

1045
01:34:18,354 --> 01:34:21,721
l'm not doing this for you,
but for myself.

1046
01:34:24,994 --> 01:34:27,087
And.. for lshita.

1047
01:34:31,534 --> 01:34:32,967
She's your girl friend, right?

1048
01:34:36,105 --> 01:34:37,834
Girl friend?

1049
01:34:41,544 --> 01:34:43,034
We were together.

1050
01:34:45,381 --> 01:34:46,939
We were going to get married.

1051
01:34:53,856 --> 01:34:55,380
But then everything went awry.

1052
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:57,517
Then you should've apologized.

1053
01:34:58,761 --> 01:35:00,126
l couldn't.

1054
01:35:02,665 --> 01:35:04,394
And now she's going to Germany.

1055
01:35:05,568 --> 01:35:07,092
For one and half year.

1056
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:10,771
l don't know if she'll
return or not.

1057
01:35:14,911 --> 01:35:17,038
Now if you save her life,
there is a chance.

1058
01:35:17,947 --> 01:35:18,914
How?

1059
01:35:19,582 --> 01:35:22,415
When she comes to you,
apologize to her.

1060
01:35:22,618 --> 01:35:24,950
Then she'll take you in her arms.

1061
01:35:25,421 --> 01:35:27,446
Hey.. -l don't know.

1062
01:35:27,757 --> 01:35:29,019
What do you mean by that?

1063
01:35:32,828 --> 01:35:34,455
Raghu! -Yes.

1064
01:35:34,997 --> 01:35:39,093
Tell me honestly, why did a
man like you saved my life?

1065
01:35:39,936 --> 01:35:42,564
l thought a fair girl
met with an accident.

1066
01:35:43,005 --> 01:35:44,632
But it turned out to be you.

1067
01:36:00,122 --> 01:36:01,589
