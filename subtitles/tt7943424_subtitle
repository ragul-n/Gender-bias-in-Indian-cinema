1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,875
Pottu (2019)

2
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,083
Take tablets regularly, madam
You'll get well soon.

3
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:10,625
Greetings, sir.

4
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:11,958
Greetings, sir.

5
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:12,708
Greetings, sir.

6
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:13,750
Greetings, sir.

7
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,875
Did you call me, sir?

8
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,375
Dean has ordered to clean B block,
clean it and then go home.

9
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,125
Okay?
- Okay, sir.

10
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:25,792
Take it.

11
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,542
What's that thing?

12
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,708
Ice boys....find who am I?

13
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:57,583
Leave me!

14
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,167
Help me, please!

15
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,292
Leave me...

16
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,500
Cleaned A block, right?
- Done.

17
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,083
Why are you sitting here?

18
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm not feeling well
- Where are the keys?

19
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,625
Door is open
- How carelessly she's replying!

20
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,208
Sweeper didn't clean the room
Dean will be here now.

21
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,583
If he comes, he'll shout on us.

22
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,542
Where are you guys?

23
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,708
Where are they?
- Cleaning the room.

24
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:54,917
You must be doing it, right?

25
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,125
I'm not feeling well.

26
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,417
Why not consult doctor
and take an injection?

27
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,083
Ghost...ghost....ghost...

28
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,792
To help students study
without any fear,

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,083
I've told them they slipped
and fell down from top floor.

30
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,792
People run away fearing ghosts
but ghosts run in fear on seeing me.

31
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,292
You're not helping me but education.

32
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,333
Wait here, I'll come with ghost,
we can take selfie with it, doctor.

33
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,583
Is this B block?

34
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,292
I'll never open it.

35
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,625
Long live ghost!

36
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:23,000
Till there are people ready to get cheated,
this cheating ghost buster will cheat them.

37
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:29,167
I'll take hefty fee,
have drinks and take rest.

38
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,583
Why the drum is circling?

39
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:41,750
Ice boys....find who am I?

40
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,167
Real ghost is here...

41
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,917
Don't come here,
I'll arrest you in this.

42
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,583
Come...

43
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:01,708
I'll be fearless only after
I have drinks.

44
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,208
Allow me to drink!

45
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:15,583
I'll not chase away ghosts but kill it.

46
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,000
They finished me
- What happened?

47
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:22,500
I've arrested all the rogue ghosts
in this vessel.

48
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,500
Indeed you've proved to be
best ghost buster Peyandi.

49
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:29,167
What proven? Only I know the pain
I had been through!

50
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:34,042
It'll calm down only if I hit nail on head
at midnight in a burial ground.

51
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,750
Though it troubled me, don't trouble it,
give it a decent burial.

52
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,625
Indeed you're a great man who
is feeling for ghosts too!

53
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,083
Please pay my fee, sir.

54
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,083
Bhaskar, pay his fees.

55
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,625
Sir, award a doctorate also to him.

56
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,167
We've chased out ghosts,
can we open B block now?

57
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:56,042
We got into trouble for
opening B block in haste.

58
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's open it on another auspicious day.

59
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,750
Mother, 25 packs of biryani!

60
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,625
What? Did you bring 25 biryanis?
- Yes.

61
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,375
I sent you an SMS, didn't you read it?

62
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:59,542
I got your message
but I didn't read what it was.

63
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,708
I sent you to buy 3 biryanis.

64
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:06,125
Your mother then told me it was no moon day,
so I sent message cancelling the order.

65
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,167
Didn't you read any message?

66
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,542
I got it, you didn't know to read.

67
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,875
You would've shown it to
the shopkeeper.

68
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,458
Hubby, come, let's offer prayers.

69
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,625
I'll come little later,
first inquire your son.

70
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,417
What's it, son?

71
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,792
Mother, it seems he sent some SMS...

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why send SMS to son?
Why didn't you call him on phone?

73
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,792
You know why I send message
instead of calling him,

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,667
if he reads and understands messages,
his knowledge of British English will improve.

75
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,792
Idiot!
- Don't talk like that.

76
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,083
My son has passed Plus 2
with good marks.

77
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,000
Does he look like a plus 2 student?
- Why not?

78
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,583
He's not smart enough as you think.

79
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,000
He's all brawn not brain at all!

80
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,542
Don't cast evil eye on my son.

81
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,333
I'm not, give those biryanis to beggars.

82
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,833
Serve it to father, mom.

83
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,500
Serve sweets along with biryani, sir.

84
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,375
How come a dead body is here in whites!

85
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,458
Who are you?

86
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,125
I helped your son to pass plus 2.

87
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,292
I've confirmed seat for your son
in MRM Medical College.

88
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,375
Thank God, my son is a doctor.

89
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,667
He'll be a doctor.

90
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,125
,Where shall I open a clinic, mother?

91
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,958
That is...
- In Kannammapet burial ground?

92
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,208
Don't talk inauspiciously
- Okay, I'll talk auspiciously.

93
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,458
The patients your son kills on operation table,
I can bury them without spending for ambulance.

94
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,125
The moment my son enters college,
you'll get your money.

95
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,667
Go home.

96
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:24,333
You're talking about giving bribe
before a police man.

97
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,250
Won't people malign me for this?

98
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,750
If they give anything, take it and have it.

99
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,667
Come son, let's have milk pudding.

100
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,250
Should I eat if they malign me?

101
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,542
What?

102
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:49,875
We studied together from class one and
today we're in medical college.

103
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,542
I've joined college by paying hefty bribe.

104
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,292
Let's take a selfie of this historic
occasion and post it on Facebook.

105
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
Take snap
- Give a pose.

106
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,000
What a face!

107
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:11,125
Is it face?
Looks like a sick hen!

108
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,000
You jealousy man!
Look at body's shape!

109
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,083
Looks like a shape less hot dog!

110
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,167
Am I like sick hen?
Am I shape less hot dog?

111
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,042
How dare you say I don't
have good shape?

112
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,833
She herself says she has great body!

113
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,708
You don't know about me.

114
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:32,708
Do you know about me?

115
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:35,375
If I see you laugh again,
I'll break your teeth.

116
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,042
Break teeth?
- Get lost, girl.

117
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,792
We're taking a selfie,
why is she getting angry?

118
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:43,083
Do you know what first lesson of MBBS is?
- What's it?

119
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,125
Don't take selfies, come.

120
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,000
Though not good in studies,
I'm the first to enter the classroom.

121
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:57,292
Who is that drying hair in class room?

122
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,542
We come to college to have great time.

123
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,292
Shall we study?

124
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,042
Ghost...ghost...
- Stop! Ghost?

125
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,125
Where's the ghost?

126
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,167
You called me a ghost, right?

127
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,417
I didn't call you a ghost,
I saw a ghost and called it ghost.

128
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,625
I've been curling my hair
for 6 months.

129
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,917
Look at my eye brows,
I've had threading.

130
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,333
My cheeks are like apples,
I've use rose powder also.

131
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:20,750
I've had golden facial in parlor
for bright face.

132
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,292
Used lip gloss to cover lip stick.

133
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,083
I've a fit and great body.

134
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,792
How dare you call me a ghost!

135
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,417
Isn't it latest fad to use ghost make up?

136
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,833
Professor walked in to save us
Come.

137
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,167
Go....get in...

138
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,292
Why are you like ghost beaten?

139
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,167
Please don't talk about it, madam.

140
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,375
If you sit with frowning face on day one,
I can't concentrate in my class.

141
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,458
Madam too called her ghost.

142
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,750
God can't be everywhere,
so he created doctors.

143
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,875
People consider doctors as Gods.

144
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,542
She's very beautiful today!

145
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,583
In make even old woman look beautiful!

146
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,083
Buddy..
- What?

147
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,250
I must pick her up at any cost.

148
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,708
You want to go on honeymoon
as fresher in college.

149
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:27,750
How can you think like that?

150
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,083
One who has teeth will eat nuts,
one who has camera will take selfies.

151
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,667
Why you are jealous, man?

152
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,250
You decided to go on honeymoon, right?

153
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,875
I've a doubt
- What?

154
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:39,083
Tell me correctly,
if man dies, he becomes ghost.

155
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,875
Do rats and frogs come
back as ghosts?

156
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,208
Why do you get such doubts?

157
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:45,125
Fearing rat my come back as ghost,
I left it without dissecting it.

158
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,375
You're so scared for this,
how can you enter mortuary then?

159
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,250
Mortuary? There are dead bodies inside,
I'll not come.

160
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,000
If you want to become a doctor,
you must come to the mortuary.

161
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,042
Come.

162
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,417
Come.
- What?

163
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,542
My parents tried a lot and failed
to get rid me of this fear.

164
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,292
I'll not come to class,
you manage it.

165
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,542
This is anatomy class, don't miss it.

166
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,042
Oh no, I'll not attend this class
- Please listen to me.

167
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,417
Attend class, please.

168
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,458
Are you sitting here?

169
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,625
I'm coming.

170
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,833
Why are you sitting here
bunking anatomy class?

171
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:21,333
Medical college is not my choice
I'm damn scared.

172
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:25,542
I want to quit medicine and
join teacher training.

173
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,333
Why are you taking drastic
decision for this silly thing?

174
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:32,625
I've very good medicine for your fear
May I?- What's it?

175
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,833
If you take the medicine
after fulfilling 48 day vow.

176
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,917
0You can do 100 post mortems in one day.

177
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,208
Where can I get that medicine?

178
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,125
It's in the prayer hall of my house.

179
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,625
If you come to my house at midnight.

180
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,292
I'll make you sit in the hall
and give you a bath.

181
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,750
If you take bath and
offer prayers in the hall.

182
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,875
You'll get blessed.

183
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,833
Would lose my fear if I take medicine?

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Now, you're coming into my track.

185
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,875
He's right.

186
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,250
I'm not coming.

187
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,333
Come, man!
- Coming, boss.

188
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:15,792
Did you see, boss?
Bribes are standing as teak pillars.

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,250
Wow! What a palatial bungalow!

190
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,542
4 kilos of gold is confirmed.

191
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,792
We're stealing it.

192
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,208
We're here to steal,
a girl is overtaking us under veil.

193
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:35,250
Is she also here to steal?

194
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,458
Why have doubts?
Let's ask her directly.

195
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,792
Hey stop!
- Who are you?

196
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,417
Why did you come here?

197
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,792
I came here for medicine.
- Is it medical shop?

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,167
Why did you come here?
- We came here for gold.

199
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,083
Is it jewellary shop?

200
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,917
Donít laugh and get us caught.

201
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,125
Boss, she's also here to rob like us.

202
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:59,250
Boss, food smell is mouth watering.

203
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:03,833
Let's eat first and then go for the kill.

204
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,292
What's this, mother?
You look just like Nithya.

205
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,125
What?

206
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,083
Why did you come here?

207
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,333
You promised to give medicine for fear.

208
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,708
You switched off phone
and sleeping like log.

209
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:28,750
I did promise medicine...
did you believe it and come here?

210
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,208
I jumped over such a big gate...
no medicine?

211
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,625
Medicine is there...sit here.

212
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,458
Serve...

213
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:39,750
I'll serve copiously,
have a go at food, boss.

214
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,167
Close your eyes, I'll give medicine.

215
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:20,583
Hey girl, I'm flying high
because of you....

216
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:29,667
Just a look and I'm floating in air...

217
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,542
You're chewing me with
your pearl like teeth....

218
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,542
When I ask you to let me go,
you're giving me a stare...

219
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,417
You're sweet like sugar...

220
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,542
You're dismantling me in parts...

221
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:54,167
Is it a boon or new found happiness?

222
00:16:54,792 --> 00:17:03,625
Hey boy, you're breaking me
into pieces like glass...

223
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:12,958
How come you're merging
into my heart like poison...

224
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,750
You're chasing me...

225
00:17:55,958 --> 00:18:00,667
You're chasing me with your eyes...

226
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:04,708
You're after me like hell...

227
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,833
You're frying me up...

228
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,708
You've entered like a rat
in a food basket...

229
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,292
You're a tiger in stealing...

230
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,792
It'll not end with a hug....

231
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,542
Love will not end on bed...

232
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,792
You're stealing me...

233
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You're burying me in your dimple...

234
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,875
You're threatening me...

235
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,917
You're taking my life...

236
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:44,875
You're hovering over me and
attacking my heart with sword....

237
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:56,833
I fear you but you're in my heart...

238
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,375
Who are they?

239
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,458
Why are you shooting after hands up?
- You?

240
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,583
What I want to tell..
- Get me the cook, go.

241
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,792
Any doubt with leg piece?

242
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,542
I doubt biryani not in chicken piece.

243
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,583
I swear on God, this is biryani.

244
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,833
You want to swear on food plate,
are you really a biryani cook?

245
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,083
Am I tamarind rice cook then?

246
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,167
Do you know about my family?

247
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,750
Was your grandpa Health Inspector?

248
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,167
No, my father is health inspector
I'll lock your hotel.

249
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,125
Boss!

250
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,917
Please don't create problem.

251
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:00,208
Your father took bribe and
10 packets of free biryani yesterday.

252
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:04,792
Will you leave the place or
shall I post your photo in Facebook?

253
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,875
Some Arnold will come to seek
justice from you on our behalf!

254
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,375
One minute, sir.
- What?

255
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,708
Do whatever you want with me, sir.

256
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,333
But don't you dare touch
my skinhead boss!

257
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:15,750
Is he your boss?

258
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,625
He looks like a burnt frying pan!
- People are watching, sir.

259
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,833
Not just people here, I'll make
sure this nation watches it on TV.

260
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:23,125
Why show us on TV?

261
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:27,083
Today you made biryani with kittens,
what if you kidnap infants for it?

262
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,958
Show us then.
- I'll show.

263
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,542
I sent you to jail,
are you out on bail to loot my home?

264
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,125
We'll get back things
where we lost it, right?

265
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,167
What did you lose in my kitchen?
- Licked sambar.

266
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,333
Fantastic!

267
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,792
Never in my life tasted
such delicious food.

268
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,792
You've engaged a very good cook.

269
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,458
I mean as maid.
- I'm not cook, I'm his wife.

270
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,583
Are you his wife?

271
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,083
Are you his wife?

272
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,708
Sister, we lost our livelihood
because of him.

273
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,625
We were very hungry, we were
eating food prepared by you, sister.

274
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,167
Suddenly he started firing
with gun, sister.

275
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,125
Do you know how happy I'm when
you call me as sister, brother?

276
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,750
You're calling robbers as brothers.
Don't you feel ashamed of it?

277
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,167
They lost their livelihood
because of you.

278
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,208
It's our duty to feed them, right?

279
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,375
He appears like my dead brother.

280
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:21,625
Don't worry, stay here and
eat happily, brother.

281
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,792
Why are you tensed, mother?
- Nothing...did your exams well?

282
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:31,833
Very tasty!

283
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,917
What are you doing here, skinhead?

284
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,125
Don't talk to me indecently.

285
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,083
Are you making fun with serious face?

286
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,333
My face is like that.

287
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:40,542
Get out!

288
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,500
Sister, you've insulted me
after serving chicken. Bye.

289
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,125
Please stop, brother....please...
- Sister's affection is stopping me.

290
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:50,458
Arjun, I've taken him as guest
for your exams.

291
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,375
Are you officer?

292
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,708
Tell him and get me also pass...

293
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,458
What?
- He's not officer but thief.

294
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,208
Why not call him a bloody thief?

295
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:05,167
I'm feeding him to open the lock of the
room which stores answer papers.

296
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,250
I'm a doctor of locks!

297
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,292
All colleges are built over lakes.
- But this is built on burial ground.

298
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,958
They asked me also to study MBBS.
- Shut up and be on job.

299
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,000
Shut my mouth!

300
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,833
Why are you shouting?

301
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,167
Skull!
- Whose skull it is?

302
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,625
Hallucination!

303
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,125
Let's go now and
come back tomorrow morning.

304
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,833
Let's go.
- Don't do it.

305
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,417
Bravely entered the college building.

306
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,458
Why grill uncooked chicken?

307
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,167
You're talking in rhyme at midnight.

308
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,125
I'll show you demo, look here!
- Demo?

309
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,958
Did you see secret of my profession?

310
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,208
Head full of brain!

311
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:50,375
0I'll show you my expertise.

312
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,583
Catch him.

313
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,333
Just now I said you're brainy.

314
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,292
This is the room.
Here it is!

315
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,125
Our lives are locked in here.
- Yes, skinhead boss.

316
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,375
This is 'Anbe Vaa' lock.

317
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,375
When I show keys,
it'll select the key.

318
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,375
Did you see? Love has started!

319
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,500
Great skinhead boss!

320
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:19,542
Gopal....open up, Gopal...

321
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,833
Am I conducting party
meeting here to applaud?

322
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:28,000
You're applauding forgetting
about answer papers.

323
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,583
Answer papers are in this room.

324
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,708
Useless lock!

325
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,375
Did you bring text books to copy?

326
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,625
Book...?
- I didn't bring any.

327
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,000
I do have it.

328
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:43,958
Come.

329
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:45,875
You'll take 3 hours to write.

330
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,000
I can finish it in 45 minutes
if I copy from text book.

331
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,500
Do something.

332
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,292
This is the safest place.

333
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,792
We're just two here.

334
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,917
You kept another large glass here.

335
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:06,000
Why did you keep such a big glass?

336
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,667
We don't have that much liquor.

337
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:08,833
I didn't keep it here.

338
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:11,500
You've started blabbering
before drinking.

339
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,583
One can have blood in body not BP.

340
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:15,958
It'll make you go bonkers!

341
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,375
Shall I serve?
- Looks like there's something here.

342
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,500
Don't drink....boy...don't drink...

343
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,792
You can sing on stage, brother.
- You think so?

344
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,542
Who finished it?

345
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,000
Liquor vanished.

346
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:31,917
Did you finish it so quickly?

347
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:32,833
No.

348
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,375
It's wrong to drink at this age.
- Okay.

349
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,917
Drinking like a ghost is worse.
- It wasn't me.

350
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,083
Just hallucination!

351
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:55,667
Ice boys....find who am I?

352
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,542
That's it!

353
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,500
How dare to enter this place!

354
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:11,708
We too don't have permission to
enter this room, how could you enter?

355
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:16,958
Someone has planned to change
my answer sheet to fail me, madam.

356
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,875
Look at this, just blank papers, madam.

357
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,542
Who changed it?
- That was...

358
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,708
I've to find it.
- Come out.

359
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,292
He's acting, madam.

360
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,250
Why are you playing with ghosts?

361
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:33,458
He's the guy!

362
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,125
Leave me.
- He changed the papers.

363
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:36,833
Get beaten up, I'll buy you biryani.

364
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:38,458
Why are you trapping me?
- He has been caught, come, madam.

365
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:39,417
Leave me.
- He's the thief.

366
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,375
Where are the stolen papers?

367
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,125
Basically I'm from a good family, madam.

368
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,125
Look here, madam!

369
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,375
Why good men have to keep
so many keys?

370
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,583
Ask him, madam.

371
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,333
Why is he over doing the scene?

372
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,667
Close the gate.

373
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:58,417
Madam, I've watched blue films
but never copied in exams.

374
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,208
Are you talking about blue films with me?

375
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:05,542
You've an interview with professor tomorrow,
if you answer his questions correctly.

376
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,917
You can continue in this college.

377
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,083
If not management will take
severe action against you.

378
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,333
Tell me, madam.
- 00Let these two boys stay here.

379
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:15,958
Hand him over to police.
- Police?

380
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,792
Even at furious mood!

381
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,625
You managed it beautifully and coolly.

382
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,083
Like cotton candy...

383
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:35,500
Brother...
- What?

384
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:36,875
You got paid, right? Get going.

385
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,750
Don't get me fired, brother.

386
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:40,375
Do you've diabetes?
- Yes.

387
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,542
But still you can munch it.

388
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,250
Leave the place quickly.

389
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:47,042
Did you go there for drinks
or fight over it?

390
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,958
Ghosts hit us before
we opened the bottle.

391
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,667
I got caught because of you.

392
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,458
I'll not get my MBBS degree.

393
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,250
Phone call?

394
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,167
Your phone?

395
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:03,667
Mother!
- Help line? Use it.

396
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:04,833
Tell me, mother.

397
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:06,583
Why your voice appears tired?

398
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:07,792
Have plenty of water, son.

399
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,750
Only then you won't feel sleepy
and get energy to copy.

400
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:12,167
I had full drinks.

401
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,625
You had hot water, right?

402
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,875
He would've had drinks and thrown up.

403
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,708
Your father is still awake.

404
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:24,875
You got your paper, right?
- No, I'm caught, mother.

405
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,417
What's this, son?

406
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,833
It seems there's a
special inquiry tomorrow.

407
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,250
Why inquiry?

408
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,625
A boy is unable to write exam in day time.

409
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,750
He's copying from books at night,
what's wrong in it?

410
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:38,208
You can understand it, mother.
- Tomorrow I'll come there.

411
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:39,708
You don't worry, son.

412
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:40,500
Okay.

413
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:41,958
Mother.
- What's it, son?

414
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:46,250
He'll tell if he knows,
he doesn't know it, right?

415
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,417
You can't save him at any cost now.

416
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,542
Meet him in Puzhal jail, mother.

417
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,208
Where are you two guys?

418
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,167
There are only fake doctors.

419
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,042
What?

420
00:28:59,250 --> 00:28:59,958
You can befriend them.

421
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:03,667
You ruined my plan getting drunk
and tell my mother that I'll go to jail.

422
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,708
I'll kill you and go to jail.

423
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,833
But still you'll go to Puzhal jail only.
I'm right, okay?

424
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,167
Careful!

425
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:31,750
Madam!

426
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:48,375
Leave me....
- Madam...

427
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,708
Stop there!

428
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,250
Don't you know entry is banned
at odd hours?

429
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,708
You'll die, go away.

430
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:43,208
Who are you? Shall I call security?

431
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,750
I said you will die!

432
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,500
Aunty, professors are here,
talk to them.

433
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,083
You're the inquiry officer, right?

434
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,250
Before asking questions,
give this to him in little quantities.

435
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,667
I've made right mix for him.

436
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,750
You're giving drinks to student,
don't you've sense?

437
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,250
What did you say?
He's my son.

438
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:23,792
This is Vallarai juice, he refuses to
take it so I mixed it with soft drinks.

439
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:26,208
Are you here as professors
without knowing this?

440
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:27,083
I don't believe you.

441
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,708
Looking at your dress and jewels,
I feel you're wedding guests.

442
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:32,083
Show me Aadhar and ration cards.

443
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,708
Show me your certificates.
I don't believe them, right?

444
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:39,417
Who is she?
- She's mother of that boy.

445
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,292
Yes.

446
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Do we look like wedding guests?

447
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,583
It's your son inside, right?

448
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:48,833
I'll send him our after serving feast,
present wedding gift and take him home.

449
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,292
Till then have this juice and
wait here with energy.

450
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,375
Did I go overboard in haste?
- Too much!

451
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,458
You're still sitting,
won't you show respect?

452
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,167
Shows no respect at all.

453
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,375
Do you know what the complaint on you is?

454
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,000
Without writing exam,
you gave blank sheets.

455
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,958
You entered stealthily at night
to fill it up.

456
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,083
Following new technique to copy.

457
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,042
We didn't think so, sir.

458
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,833
What's the full form of MBBS, Arjun?

459
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,250
Fall at her feet saying,
you don't know the answer.

460
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:29,333
He's not answering any question.

461
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:32,958
I suspect he changed the papers.

462
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,875
Please sit down,
I'll finish this inquiry.

463
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,125
Do you know the answer or not?

464
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,625
I'm sure it's him.

465
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,708
Sir, you're Professor of Physiology,
she's Bio-Chemistry professor,

466
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:58,292
She's Professor of Pathology and
he's professor of Human anatomy.

467
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,000
Why is he here?
- Chair is empty, right?

468
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,083
He came to meet me.

469
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,917
Why is he in inquiry?

470
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,000
Wait in my cabin.

471
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,292
You're too much!
How well you manage them!

472
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,583
Will you answer now?

473
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:28,917
Tell me!

474
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,625
How can he answer?

475
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,500
So, you studied last night
and I had drinks.

476
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:59,292
You misunderstood
a brilliant student, sir.

477
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:03,542
Aunty, your answered question brilliantly.
- My son?

478
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,625
No way!

479
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:07,375
How could he answer without
having Vallarai juice?

480
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,625
Like mother like son, very smart!

481
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,167
What do you say?

482
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:19,667
His head will reel now for
my next question.

483
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,833
Leave me!

484
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:34,958
Who pinched my waist now?

485
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,833
Not me.
- It was me, madam.

486
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,083
I don't know why I did like that!

487
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,250
Behave like a professor not like a rogue.

488
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,458
You must remember only this!

489
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,042
I don't remember anything.

490
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,417
Stop please!

491
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,500
What's your problem with me?

492
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,708
Why did you ask me to go out?

493
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,500
Veeraiah!

494
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:51,583
Sir!

495
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,542
Where are you boys?

496
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,333
Sir, he'll come.

497
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:02,625
I'm living with the hope
that you'll come back, sir.

498
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,583
Sir!

499
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:07,167
Your hope isn't belied.

500
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:10,167
How much trouble you took for me, sir!

501
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,917
Don't spare anyone, sir!

502
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,875
Kill every one of them, sir!

503
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,250
Leave them, boys!

504
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:24,042
Come on, boys!
Today is death day for all of you!

505
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,625
Who are you, man?

506
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:29,875
Are you student or sorcerer?

507
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,583
He's asking you a question, right?

508
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,125
Who the hell that is?

509
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,333
Tell me, Bhaskar.
- Ghost is back, doctor.

510
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
What?

511
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,750
It has killed everyone,
only I managed to escape.

512
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,500
Don't harm me....save me...

513
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,125
What's happening there, Bhaskar?

514
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,292
Don't harm me, please...

515
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:54,208
Tell me....
- I'll not tell.

516
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:55,542
Won't you tell me?

517
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:58,917
I'll not tell.

518
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,667
How did you enter this girl's body?
Tell me!

519
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:02,792
I'll not tell!

520
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:07,500
Samy, we visited every temple
and met every God man.

521
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:10,500
You must save our daughter, sir.

522
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,667
Tell me.

523
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:12,958
Move!

524
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,042
Tell me! I'm Brahmeshwari asking you!

525
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,583
Leave this body.
- No way.

526
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,625
Give me amulet.
- Take it, Guru!

527
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,458
Tell me.

528
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:24,833
Who are you?

529
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:27,542
I'm Muthu who hanged
himself to death...

530
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,917
Brahmeshwari is warning you,
leave the body.

531
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:31,500
If not...

532
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:34,542
Come, RK.

533
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,625
You built college in burial ground,
is college like cremation ground?

534
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,417
I opened B block without caring
about your warning.

535
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,583
4 of my men died.

536
00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:43,500
I tried to contact you but couldn't.

537
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,542
Your disciple told me he had
arrested the ghost.

538
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,208
I did catch it but don't know
how it managed to escape.

539
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:50,708
What to do now?

540
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:02,500
Bury this ghost and hit a nail on it.
- Go...go...

541
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:09,167
You're fine now, go.

542
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:15,750
If I arrest a ghost
it can never escape from it.

543
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:20,500
I'm not human soul to get arrested by you,
I'm soul of Satan!

544
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:23,125
I know how it managed
to reach your place.

545
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I'll arrest it.

546
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:29,083
Try to catch me if you can!

547
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,542
Making coffee for whom? For me?

548
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,458
If I make coffee for you, '
you'll die with high BP.

549
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:39,500
This is for my son.

550
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:44,042
You always said he's useless son,
what's this sudden love for him?

551
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,125
What to do? I was careless till now.

552
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,917
I realized today that I've a son
who is like Bill Gates.

553
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:54,083
So, I'll serve a good coffee and
make amendments with my son.

554
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:02,083
After achieving so much, he's sitting
silently as if nothing had happened.

555
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:05,917
Son, I heard about it.

556
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:13,917
It seems Professors went crazy
with your answers in inquiry.

557
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:18,208
I'm ashamed of scolding you
all these days, son.

558
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,542
Go, man!

559
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,958
Why are you angry on me, son?

560
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,625
Get out, man!

561
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,458
This is too much!

562
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,375
You have your coffee, I'll go.

563
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,833
Already had it.

564
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,750
Had it...?

565
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:37,042
What's this?

566
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,833
Coffee cup is in my hand.

567
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:41,500
His mouth is there!

568
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,667
Mouth-Fi like Wi-Fi?

569
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:50,208
He was born to achieve great things,
he would've done it.

570
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,083
Thanks son.

571
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:56,042
If he sucks up river Cauvery water like this,
it'll of great help to Tamil Nadu.

572
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:04,792
Doctor...save me....
- Doctor, my body is burning, sir.

573
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,125
I'm dying with pain, sir.

574
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:09,667
Someone is calling.
Can we meet them?

575
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,542
Don't turn back.

576
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,792
Evil souls are calling you.

577
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,292
They're calling you in different voices.

578
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:20,042
If you turn back to see, you're dead.

579
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,042
Brahmeshwari! Look here!

580
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:34,750
I thought her body would've decomposed
and become mud.

581
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:38,500
But the evil soul managed to escape.

582
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:41,917
Blood is still warm, did you see it?

583
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,583
Cheers, boss!

584
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,958
We're getting kicked,
why is he huffing and puffing?

585
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,792
Piss?

586
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,792
Wetted your pant?
- No...

587
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:01,042
What's the gesture?

588
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:18,708
Let's escape before
they start thrashing us, boss.

589
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,208
I'll cut you!

590
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:23,292
We'll take bath and come with amulet.

591
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,333
Wait till then.

592
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,708
We must find which body
this evil soul has entered.

593
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:30,208
Are you searching me?

594
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,125
All of you would die!

595
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:47,292
I'll find it.

596
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,792
I've been observing you,
of late you're behaving differently.

597
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,083
What's your problem?

598
00:42:52,292 --> 00:43:00,625
Goddess Kali, come!

599
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:07,667
This blessed lemon will find
the evil soul.

600
00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:11,417
It seems you're not answering
her phone calls.

601
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,458
She's pestering me with questions.

602
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,708
What am I to tell her?

603
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:17,792
Get anyone who faces you!

604
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,625
Go!
- I'll go, you inform her and go.

605
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,208
Did you talk to him?
- Talk to him yourself.

606
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,458
Are you angry on me?

607
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:35,333
Do you feel is it cheap
if a girl falls in love with a boy?

608
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,958
Or else will you like only if I make you
after me and then say I love you?

609
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,875
Answer me, Arjun!

610
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,500
If you poke your nose in my matters
unnecessarily, you will die.

611
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,458
Arjun, I'm talking to you...

612
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,792
I've told you, right?

613
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,750
Son!

614
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,375
Why are you going to college
with baggage?

615
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:46,417
Cultural programs in college and
exams are also coming.

616
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,042
I'm going to stay in hostel for studies.

617
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,167
Hubby, please come here.
- Tell me. What?

618
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,083
Our son wants to stay in hostel
for studies.

619
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,125
Let him study.

620
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:55,208
His thirst for knowledge
is moving at jet speed.

621
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:56,583
Why are you putting speed
breakers to slow him down?

622
00:44:56,792 --> 00:45:00,708
He flattered professors with h
is profound knowledge.

623
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:03,542
He'll achieve something great to make
this nation turn back to see him.

624
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,708
Let him do it but let him stay
with us, we've only one son.

625
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,208
You pampered and spoilt our son.
He needs little privacy.

626
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,250
Only then he can dedicate himself
and achieve great things.

627
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,625
Can't he do it staying in home?

628
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:18,625
Whatever you do is wrong and
whatever he does is right!

629
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,417
You carry on, son.

630
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:27,042
Look at him, he has a dot
on forehead, wears anklets,

631
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,417
he's putting on my slippers.

632
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:31,458
He said about cultural
competition in college, right?

633
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:32,500
I think he'll dance there.

634
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:35,500
Started rehearsal from home.
- Is it?

635
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:46,292
Good morning, brother.
- How is it?

636
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,667
Your costume is excellent.

637
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:52,542
But when you walk,
I could hear sound of anklets...

638
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,667
...that was also excellent.

639
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:04,083
Eat well, keep fit body.

640
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:10,125
Though he's possessed by ghost,
he has great affection for us.

641
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,042
Let's have lunch, come.

642
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,417
He's telling us symbolically to eat well
and keep fit for getting thrashed.

643
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:16,750
Without knowing this...

644
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,833
Who are you guys?
You appear like wild hogs!

645
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,833
Not hogs but Porcupines!

646
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,375
Hasn't your soul blessed with peace?

647
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,208
I'm still a virgin.

648
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:29,833
Anyone may tell lies
but not this blessed lemon.

649
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:30,875
Stop it.

650
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,542
I'm also telling them same thing,
sister with locks of hair.

651
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,417
No evil soul can escape from me.

652
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:36,833
You?

653
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:40,875
No!

654
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,750
Bring him down.

655
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:44,833
That's what I was saying for an hour.

656
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,792
Since Iím medical college student,
I'm saved from paying fee.

657
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,875
Had it been someone else,
they would've spent money like hell.

658
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,708
Think about expenses before
thrashing someone.

659
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:05,583
Is it nice?

660
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:15,333
Come on, boys!

661
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,875
Don't you've sense to watch
a girl applying make-up?

662
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:20,333
Is the ghost inside you?

663
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,917
Have you found it?
- Yes.

664
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,167
Come.
- Why?

665
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:25,208
Come I say!

666
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,875
4 plus 4 is 8...

667
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,542
You and I am a couple...

668
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:05,625
If you touch me, I'll apply dot...

669
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:09,125
Shall I apply dot on forehead?

670
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,292
Come on I say!

671
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,000
Are you here to destroy me?
- No.

672
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,250
I'll apply dot!

673
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:16,000
Anyone else is here?

674
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,250
Anyone here?

675
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,042
Come out!

676
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:26,000
Hail Goddess Kali!

677
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:30,000
Don't allow anyone inside
till prayers are over.

678
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:35,417
Tell me, sir.

679
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,375
How come you appear before me suddenly?

680
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:42,792
Brahmeshwari ordered us
to follow bodies with evil souls.

681
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,333
We'll find and destroy it.

682
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,125
Now, I'm at peace.

683
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,542
Wear this.

684
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:54,333
What's this? It fell down.

685
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,708
Evil souls don't have necks!

686
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:07,208
Evil soul, stop!

687
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:18,125
He killed your men and turned
them into evil souls to go against you.

688
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:21,542
What a terrible evil soul he could be!

689
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,708
He's studying bigger book than mine.

690
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:27,167
Why are you studying third year book?

691
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,042
Yes.
- Yes?

692
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:35,958
Hail Goddess Kali!

693
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:39,458
Are you possessed by any evil soul?

694
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:44,833
Hail Goddess Kali!

695
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,500
Don't stop chanting holy hymns!

696
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,375
Dared to take on me!

697
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:10,458
I'll reduce your body to ashes!

698
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:15,625
Hail Goddess Kali!

699
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:18,125
Hail Goddess Kali!

700
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:23,750
No!

701
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,708
Hail Goddess Kali!

702
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:26,458
Leave me!

703
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,542
Hail Goddess Kali!

704
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,250
What happened to you, Arjun?
- Leave me!

705
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,250
Hail Goddess Kali!

706
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:37,167
Stop!

707
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,333
Hail Goddess Kali!

708
00:51:40,417 --> 00:51:41,375
Leave me...

709
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,375
Leave me...I'll kill you...

710
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,667
After years the evil soul's body
is reduced to ashes.

711
00:51:55,875 --> 00:52:00,458
Evil soul will be in someone's body
within your college campus.

712
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:05,250
I've built a protective wall
with my divine power.

713
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,917
What to eat? Chicken or soup?

714
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,958
Brother, please move the chicken.

715
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,667
Sister, blood fry is missing.

716
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:44,042
Delicious aroma of sambar
is fantastic!

717
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,625
I cooked everything.

718
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,292
I'll get blood fry.

719
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,625
Boss!
- What?

720
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,417
What's the first thing you get
on seeing this?

721
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:54,292
Can't you tell anything directly?
Come straight.

722
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,417
Doesn't it look like food
offered to dead souls?

723
00:52:58,625 --> 00:52:59,625
To hell with your nasty mouth!

724
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:01,500
He seems very hungry.

725
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:06,542
Fishbone stuck in throat?

726
00:53:06,792 --> 00:53:07,917
Look there!

727
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,042
Bad ghost!

728
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,917
Boss, run faster!

729
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,625
Why are you running out?

730
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:19,583
Stomach upset!

731
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:22,417
Why both at a time like twins?

732
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:24,167
I think my cooking so good
to get digested so quickly.

733
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,667
Yes...yes...
- Go...go...

734
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,292
What's this, son?
You're back in home in 2 days.

735
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,250
Couldn't stay away from mother
for long, right?

736
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:36,833
Clashes in college,
Dean was murdered.

737
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:42,542
What? Clashes in college
and dean got killed?

738
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:47,208
Dean wouldn't have been killed by others,
he alone would've killed him.

739
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:48,625
Boss?
- Yes.

740
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:52,625
He would've asked question,
he would've killed him in anger.

741
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:58,333
Ghost is in good mood,
before it comes back, let's have food.

742
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,458
Keep an eye on ghost.

743
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,208
Boss, he finished everything
in a jiffy.

744
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:10,625
Mother!
'- Come!

745
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,333
Did he say college is closed
for Dean's death?

746
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:15,333
Yes.
- No, he didn't die, he's alive.

747
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:18,792
He cut classes and
telling everyone that Dean is dead.

748
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:21,000
I think there's some problem
with his head, mother.

749
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,875
He's a boy but living like a girl.

750
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:23,958
You won't believe if I tell.

751
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:25,625
He looks eagerly at necklaces.
He puts on nail polish.

752
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,417
He looks sideways and talks in murmurs.

753
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,292
Why is he carrying this sari?
- This?

754
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,583
This is my sari.

755
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,958
Useless bugger!
He took it as my remembrance.

756
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:36,542
He's in hostel, right?
Is it any big deal? Move.

757
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,083
Move?
- Come and have lunch.

758
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,625
I'm telling you he turning into a girl,
you're going away carelessly.

759
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,958
I smell something really bad.

760
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,625
This is not bad smell but
my skinhead smell.

761
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,625
I'm not Pavadai but Poonandi.

762
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,708
Inner skirt.

763
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:13,792
Titanic ship is walking majestically.

764
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,750
If you're Rose, then I'm Jack.

765
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:31,250
Why did you come here?

766
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,417
I came to catch ghost.
- Did you catch one?

767
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,875
You caught me before that.
- Won't you ever reform?

768
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,708
If I reform, can I write Thirukkural?

769
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:41,250
You!

770
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,125
Love line is running fine on your palm.

771
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:47,042
It is not wrong for me
to fall in love with you.

772
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:49,917
Even advises to guys like
will go to deaf ears.

773
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:53,250
I swear on you that I'll never
again steal in my life.

774
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:54,667
Bye, professor.

775
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:56,042
Thief!

776
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:00,458
You promised not to steal again
but you stole something from me.

777
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:04,333
Oh no! You're going to say chewing gum
dialogue you stole my heart.

778
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:07,500
I'll deliver a dialogue,
would you like to hear it?

779
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:10,708
You're sixteen, I'm eighteen.

780
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,042
Shall we?

781
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,250
Ring!

782
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,125
This is also stolen.

783
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,542
Are you my nightingale?

784
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:25,250
My nightingale!

785
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:33,292
Enamored...my heart is enamored...

786
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:35,458
What?

787
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:40,083
Some ghost is singing song here.

788
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,083
That isn't ghost,
I was singing song now.

789
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:45,583
Are you dejected, my Prince?

790
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,708
I'm scared, boss.
- I'm not singing now.

791
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:51,333
Can sky shrink ever?

792
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:59,583
Can't...heart can't take it...

793
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:07,083
Myna, take a card for Mohana.

794
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:09,500
Why do you call a parrot as Myna?

795
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,583
For the troubles you're facing,
do you need to clear this doubt?

796
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:12,792
What problems am I facing?

797
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,667
You came here on your own will,
I said let me ask about future.

798
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:16,625
Okay, you can go.

799
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,542
Madam, don't mistake me.
Iíve named my parrot as Myna.

800
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,667
Is it? Okay, come out.

801
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,208
Why is it not picking card?

802
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:26,292
You just recharged it,
it wants you to top up for Rs.50.

803
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,625
You've taught it so much for Rs.50.

804
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:29,542
Okay, turn that side.

805
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:30,792
That's my livelihood, madam.

806
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Take money.

807
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:33,792
Come out, Myna.

808
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:36,333
Pick as good card for my son.

809
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:40,125
My son must finish MBBS
and become a great doctor.

810
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,792
See if the card has Goddess of learning?

811
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:47,333
No problem if it is Goddess of Learning
but this card has devil!

812
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,750
Why the parrot is shivering?
- Why are you scared, Myna?

813
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,167
Is that your son, madam?

814
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:58,958
My parrot is scared.
- You scared it.

815
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,417
Why are you looking around my house?

816
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,167
Don't think of stealing my home a night.

817
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:06,958
My husband is police Inspector,
he'll gun you down.

818
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:09,458
Do I look like a thief?
I'm here to foretell future.

819
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:12,000
My fearless Myna is scared
on seeing your son.

820
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:15,708
Something is wrong in this house.
- Yes, hell.

821
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:18,042
Madam, escape from here,
there's evil spirit here.

822
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,792
There's evil spirit in this house.
- Take your mat.

823
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:21,625
Give that to ghost.

824
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:24,792
He calls parrot as Myna and
tells there's ghost here.

825
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,833
A man is on fast inside police station.

826
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,083
He's not listening to any advice.

827
00:58:29,292 --> 00:58:30,417
Ask him, what's the reason?

828
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,667
It seems Myna is missing,
so he's fasting.

829
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:38,625
For genuine love or illicit relationship,
lodge a complaint,

830
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:41,625
hit the man's back 15 times
and send him away.

831
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:44,000
Can you dare hit me?
I'll transfer you to remote desert.

832
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:45,000
Shut up.

833
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:47,542
He has names parrot as Myna.

834
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,708
It is no ordinary parrot.

835
00:58:54,542 --> 00:59:01,708
It can tell correctly PM's next foreign visit
and when Mallya would return to India.

836
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,958
It is multi talented
politically astute parrot.

837
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,292
I got a clue.

838
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,125
Where was it last seen?

839
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:11,708
Some damn lady called it
to foretell future.

840
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:12,792
No doubt.

841
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,250
That lady's husband is responsible
for missing parrot.

842
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:18,333
He would've got parrot
kidnapped using henchmen.

843
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:21,875
If we find that rogue,
we can find parrot.

844
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:24,625
Then, you're the criminal,
you must be arrested.

845
00:59:24,792 --> 00:59:26,375
Am I criminal?
Should I be arrested?

846
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,375
Yes.
- What yes?

847
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm an Inspector who arrests criminals,
how can I be criminal myself?

848
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,208
Please listen patiently.

849
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:37,458
When you left to office,
an astrologer entered home.

850
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:40,208
Seeing our son, parrot flew away in fear.

851
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:45,833
Astrologer said there's an evil spirit
in this house.

852
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:46,792
Okay, get me some water.

853
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,083
Ordinary water or ice water?

854
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:51,125
Okay, I'll get it from fridge.

855
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:53,708
Hot water in fridge?

856
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,125
He's foolish.

857
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:57,875
How can anyone get hot water from fridge?

858
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:03,417
Hubby....hubby...come here...

859
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:06,625
What happened?
Why are you shouting like devil?

860
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:08,042
Ghost...ghost....

861
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,542
Ghost inside fridge?
- Yes.

862
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,333
How can ghost be inside fridge?

863
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:15,625
Don't go there.

864
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:17,583
How can see ghost without going there?

865
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,208
A cowardly wife for a brave man.

866
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,875
Ghost doesn't know about police.

867
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:23,833
Don't shout.

868
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,208
You scared me,
why are you standing away from me?

869
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:32,458
Where's the head?

870
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:38,000
I used my police power to get free fruits.

871
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:40,167
Instead of giving juice for me,
are you keeping it safely for your dad?

872
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,792
If you talk about ghost, I'll kill you.

873
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:45,625
Abracadabra! Go away.

874
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:49,458
Bloody ghost!
Come and change bed spread.

875
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,625
Who is it?

876
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:05,042
Who is crying?

877
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:09,667
Hubby!

878
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:16,208
Why are you looking at me indifferently?

879
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:18,792
I'm already in bad mood,
don't turn it worse.

880
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,917
Remove your make up and sleep.

881
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:21,375
Don't you dare touch me?

882
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,542
How angry he is!

883
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:30,333
I can hear voices.
Who is crying?

884
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,042
Whoever it may be, talk to me directly.

885
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,333
Don't make noise without being seen.

886
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:38,208
Hubby...please, get up.

887
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:40,792
Someone please come here.

888
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,958
Why are you howling like a fox?

889
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,500
Are you scared on seeing me?

890
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:51,083
When I moved bed spread
to wake you up...

891
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,083
A skeleton caught my hand.

892
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,917
Do I look like a skeleton to you?

893
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:56,625
I'm scared when you roll your eyes.

894
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:58,250
I'll hit you.

895
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,375
I'll divorce you without any reason.

896
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:02,500
Switch off the light.

897
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,083
Okay, you go to sleep.

898
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,333
Don't stare at me.

899
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:10,375
We'll sleep in different rooms
from tomorrow.

900
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:14,583
Ghost!

901
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:26,083
Parrot was happily living
in forest with its family.

902
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:27,250
You caught it and
taught few tricks to it.

903
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,833
You made my wife to believe in ghosts.

904
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:32,667
Come and tell my wife you lied to her.

905
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,583
My parrot isn't scared of Tsunami
but got scared on seeing your son.

906
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:36,417
What does it mean?

907
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,667
What it means? -
There's ghost in your house.

908
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:40,792
Should I believe if you say thrice?

909
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,792
How do you or your parrot
know there's ghost in my house?

910
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,958
If you don't believe me,

911
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:48,750
at midnight, draw a motif,
light a lamp and keep a lemon in hall.

912
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:50,750
If it spoils the motif and
puts off the lamp.

913
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,375
It means thereís ghost in your house.

914
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,792
If not take any action
you deem fit for me.

915
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:56,250
I'll take you to task.

916
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,875
Why are you bringing
your face close to me?

917
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,500
I'm scared on seeing your bulging eyes.

918
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:03,667
I too got scared.

919
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,625
Look, how beautiful the lemon is.

920
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:08,292
Why ghosts are scared of this?

921
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,958
It seems ghosts get stomach
upset if they eat this.

922
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,750
I'll prove there's no ghost
in this house.

923
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:14,833
Hey fool!

924
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,708
Okay, keep this in hall.

925
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:20,500
Ask me to cook with it, I'll do it.

926
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:22,542
Cooks and ghosts don't jell well.
- Why?

927
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,250
When we cook, we get vapour, right?

928
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:26,875
That's right.
You keep this in hall.

929
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:30,000
Brother is our guest.

930
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,500
Guests and ghosts don't get along well.

931
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:34,542
You're a police officer, you do it.

932
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:38,417
Are you insulting brave man
before these fools?

933
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:41,500
I'll check inside, if there's
no ghost, I'll bite your neck.

934
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,375
I must be carrying gun but
they're asking me to carry this.

935
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:47,500
Where's the ghost?
I'll hit ghost with slipper.

936
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:49,958
Why are you scared?
- No, I'm not.

937
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:52,167
I'll make ghost run in fear of death.

938
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,292
Don't kill it,
may get charged for murder.

939
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,667
I'll not file FIR against myself.

940
01:03:56,875 --> 01:04:01,250
Ghost, if you had entered this house
without my permission.

941
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:04,333
I request you to vacate
the place immediately.

942
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:07,042
Don't get scared, brother.
He'll manage it well.

943
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,250
If you're male ghost, go to Fig tree,
if you're female ghost, go to tamarind tree.

944
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:14,375
I don't believe it but still
if you're hiding in my home,

945
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,625
I'll encounter you without
any evidence.

946
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:18,167
I've lighted the lamp.

947
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:21,042
Who is it?

948
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:31,958
Who are you?

949
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:35,292
You son!

950
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:38,458
There's ghost in home, let's escape.

951
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:39,333
Where did it go away?

952
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,125
Will you encounter me?
- Don't shout.

953
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,667
Ghost may hear it.

954
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,042
Do you think we'll get scared
of law and order?

955
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,792
Why are you talking like ghost?

956
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:52,542
Not like ghost.
- Then, who else?

957
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:53,792
I'm ghost!

958
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:59,375
Water....water...

959
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:02,833
Still pending?
- Yes.

960
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:04,292
Continue with your job.

961
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:08,792
Run!

962
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:09,917
Ghost!

963
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,917
Our son has been possessed by ghost.

964
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Is our son possessed by ghost?

965
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,167
Is he telling truth?

966
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,083
Hubby...hubby...

967
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,500
Hubby!

968
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:27,625
Hubby!

969
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,250
Are you still here?

970
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:38,917
Why are you coming in auto?

971
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:41,375
I ran away in fear.
I ran away 9 kms.

972
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,000
9 kms in 8 minutes!

973
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:46,875
I was running,
I felt someone was after me.

974
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:48,958
When I turned back to see...
- We were behind him.

975
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:49,875
I was relieved.

976
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,833
Are you really a police officer?

977
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:54,500
I struggled so much
to make my son a doctor.

978
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,208
But he has become a ghost.

979
01:05:56,417 --> 01:05:58,833
Though I got thrashed like hell,
I withstood everything.

980
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,792
Why should we get thrashed?
- You must.

981
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,625
We must chase away the ghosts
and save our Arjun.

982
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,000
We'll thrash them.

983
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:08,042
Let's enter house together.
- Let's go.

984
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:12,000
Why are you standing
outside house like ghosts?

985
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:13,167
When did you go out, son?

986
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,208
When was I inside?
I'm coming home now.

987
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:18,708
Just now you punched
on my face inside home.

988
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:20,000
What is he saying?

989
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:24,500
It seems today he arrested and thrashed
a dreaded goon in station.

990
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:27,333
He hit back and
bloodied his face.

991
01:06:27,542 --> 01:06:30,208
When did I arrest a goon?

992
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:33,500
Keep your tiffs later, I'm hungry,
come and serve food, mother.

993
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,042
Go son, I'll follow you.

994
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:38,667
You don't sit on floor even
while offering prayers.

995
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,208
Today you're sitting on floor
to have food in plate.

996
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:43,833
Come and sit on table.
- When did I eat in plate?

997
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,667
Where's banana leaf?
- Leaf?

998
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,833
Spread it.
- You do it, Mohana.

999
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:55,208
Do it.
- No, you do it.

1000
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:58,250
Leaf is torn.
- Do it.

1001
01:06:58,417 --> 01:06:59,250
Son!

1002
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,875
Where's Anjalai?

1003
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:04,167
Affection on aunt!

1004
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,375
Which aunt?
- He wants Anjalai.

1005
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:09,500
I fired Anjalai 3 months ago
because of you.

1006
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:17,833
Suspecting me, mother fired Anjalai
from job 3 months ago.

1007
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Where are 5 leaves?

1008
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:21,500
He wants 5 leaves.

1009
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,792
Bring it.
- Bring it.

1010
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:24,542
I'm hungry!

1011
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,292
Come, let's eat.

1012
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,542
We're back!

1013
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,542
Why are you serving food?

1014
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,208
I've to serve food in leaf, right?

1015
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:34,708
We can't serve food without leaf, right?

1016
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:37,000
When did I eat food?
- What else then?

1017
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:38,583
Millet porridge.
- Don't use bad words.

1018
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:41,083
I'm hungry, get me millet balls.
- Millet balls?

1019
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,000
I'll make it for you.

1020
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:46,458
My husband is police officer,
look what he's doing now.

1021
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:46,708
He's preparing millet balls.

1022
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:47,792
What?

1023
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,500
Why ghost is asking for millet balls?

1024
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,417
May be ghost died with diabetes.

1025
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,208
Isn't there anyone to clear our doubt?

1026
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:56,250
Ghost took away everything.

1027
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:02,708
Ghost is missing....
Millet balls too are missing.

1028
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:06,625
God, protect us!

1029
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:14,833
Ice boys....find who am I?

1030
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:22,542
Fantastic millet balls!

1031
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:26,958
Why are you thrashing your father, son?

1032
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:43,000
Gods!

1033
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:45,667
Apart from ghosts from grandpa
and grandma's stories,

1034
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:51,000
all other ghosts have entered
my son's body.

1035
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:56,583
God, may the ghost that possesses my son
leave him and go away to cremation ground.

1036
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,125
Goddess, you must chase away the ghosts.

1037
01:08:58,333 --> 01:09:00,458
All of you see here, come here.

1038
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:01,250
Let's sprinkle sacred ash.

1039
01:09:01,458 --> 01:09:02,917
Gents first.
- You first

1040
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:05,583
Don't get scared, I'm with you.
Come bravely.

1041
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:09,167
Shall I apply sacred ash?

1042
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:12,250
Turn him and apply ash on his forehead.

1043
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:13,208
Don't I know that?

1044
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:15,458
I'm unable to do it.
Please hold my hand.

1045
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,875
She's shivering like
an electrocuted crow.

1046
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:20,000
Hold hand.

1047
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:23,167
Don't get scared.

1048
01:09:23,417 --> 01:09:26,083
All are cowards.

1049
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:27,792
Turn...turn...

1050
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,667
Why are you all like ghosts?

1051
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:35,000
Mother, you look horrible.

1052
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:39,042
My son is in jovial mood.

1053
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:42,667
Sister, ghost hasn't left him.
It says it'll kill me.

1054
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,875
How dare! You talk bad about my son.

1055
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:46,708
You're calling him as brother,
send him out.

1056
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:49,125
Brother, I'll kill you.

1057
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:52,875
Get up and take bath,
I'll get you almond milk.

1058
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:54,458
You too come with us.

1059
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:56,583
Boss!

1060
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,625
Boss, I'll get milk.

1061
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:03,625
Fool! Who wants milk?
- Don't want?

1062
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,125
Get me soup!

1063
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:08,875
Boss, give company to ghost,
I'll get soup.

1064
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:10,667
He's leaving me with ghost.

1065
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:13,875
Hey orangutan! Come closer.

1066
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:17,625
Only you're here, you fool!

1067
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,583
Come here.

1068
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:23,875
Dog's tail!

1069
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:25,167
Fox's horn!

1070
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:26,292
Elephant's egg!

1071
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,417
Berry seed!

1072
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:31,375
What is he up to?

1073
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,208
Soup is ready.

1074
01:10:33,417 --> 01:10:35,125
What's all this?

1075
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:37,125
This is soup to chase out ghosts.

1076
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,958
You mean medicine to ghosts.

1077
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:43,292
Not my words but a great Siddha
doctor said this.

1078
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,542
Cook, Siddha is always right.

1079
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,083
Lock up the ghost with this soup.

1080
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,500
Give me little for taste.

1081
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:55,542
This is not for dogs,
I mean for ghosts only.

1082
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:58,167
Serve it.
- Serve it yourself.

1083
01:10:58,375 --> 01:10:59,500
I think you're scared of it.

1084
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:00,292
Go.

1085
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,375
Ghost will get kicked out with my soup.

1086
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:04,375
Ghost is finished tonight!

1087
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:07,333
Brother...brother...

1088
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,083
Where are you, brother?

1089
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:12,458
I've brought hot soup for you.

1090
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:15,792
How come brother turned like this?

1091
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,125
Am I not beautiful?

1092
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,667
You look great!

1093
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:24,208
How could you change so much
in so short time!

1094
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:26,000
Don't I look good?

1095
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:29,333
You look ravishing!

1096
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:32,417
Which man wouldn't love
a beautiful thing like you?

1097
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:34,208
For you?
- I'm also a man, right?

1098
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:37,042
Man must have moustache, you fool!

1099
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:44,875
My mother used to give me bath by applying
turmeric, that's why no moustache.

1100
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:48,292
For your mother?
- Nasty fun! For me.

1101
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,167
Whatever goes in will
come out in short time.

1102
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:52,458
How?
- Like this!

1103
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,208
Where is he? Missing?

1104
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,000
Are women so cheap to you?

1105
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:04,292
Women are like Gods to me.

1106
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,125
Why are you coming like you got raped?

1107
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:15,458
There's a beautiful girl inside...
- Beautiful girl?

1108
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:18,375
Though I don't have moustache,
kissed me...

1109
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,458
I got it.

1110
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:21,625
The girl likes men without
moustache, right?

1111
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,167
Moustache is the problem.

1112
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:26,917
You're jealous of my skinhead.

1113
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,458
Watch my romance now!

1114
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:30,333
He's not listening to me.

1115
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:31,833
He'll not get sense without
getting thrashed...

1116
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:33,417
It's me!

1117
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:37,458
If I kiss her,
brother won't mistake me, right?

1118
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:38,917
Brother is going to kiss.

1119
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,083
What are you saying?
- I said it's brother's plan.

1120
01:12:41,292 --> 01:12:43,750
Trust me and go,
get a good thrashing.

1121
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,333
I feel very shy!

1122
01:12:45,542 --> 01:12:49,500
Go with same shyness,
he'll give good thrashing.

1123
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:53,833
For the night of romance...

1124
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,042
Thrashing!

1125
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:56,667
Brother!

1126
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,583
Where's brother?

1127
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:04,000
Will you meet only him?

1128
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:07,750
I don't want to meet brother.
I want only this beautiful angel.

1129
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:09,667
Then, you start it.

1130
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,125
So quickly!

1131
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:13,708
I don't know where to start!

1132
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:15,708
Shall I start it?

1133
01:13:17,042 --> 01:13:18,500
Perfect figure!

1134
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:26,708
Come...does your nasty face
need an angel?

1135
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:27,875
I'll not ask...

1136
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,042
Come...

1137
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:52,958
God bless you.
- Thanks.

1138
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:57,833
I saw you coming out in brief,
I misunderstood it.

1139
01:13:58,042 --> 01:14:01,708
If we stay here another minute,
ghost will make a soup of us.

1140
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:03,792
Come, let's tell sister and
leave the place.

1141
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:08,292
He may hear us,
let's go away without informing them.

1142
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:16,667
You're going around half naked
in a house with woman.

1143
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:18,375
Where are women here?
There are only ghosts.

1144
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:19,333
I'll hit you.

1145
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:20,292
We didn't mean your wife.

1146
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,583
What happened to my brother?

1147
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,417
What was their crime that
you're thrashing them?

1148
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:26,750
Are you giving respect
a brother-in-law deserves?

1149
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:29,500
Forget about respect,
we searched all over the place.

1150
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:30,875
Where have you hidden 4 kilos of gold?

1151
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,750
Who told you there are
4 kilos of gold in this house?

1152
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:36,625
We came here knowing your wife
came with 4 kilos of gold.

1153
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:38,083
That's true.
- What truth?

1154
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:41,417
It's true they promised 4 kilos
of gold as dowry.

1155
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:42,875
Okay.

1156
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:45,208
But reduced it to 3 kilos
when we got engaged.

1157
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,625
Go further.

1158
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,583
It was reduced to 2 kilos
when we got married.

1159
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,792
Then?

1160
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,625
On our first night, she walked in
without anything.

1161
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:53,917
Why are you telling us?

1162
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:55,583
She came without a gram of gold.

1163
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:56,958
Are you wearing fake jewels?

1164
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:58,458
Gold plated jewellary, brother.

1165
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:01,000
You elf!
We don't want anything with you.

1166
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:03,917
What about biryani?
- Serve everything to him.

1167
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,708
Come.

1168
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,417
Are you still here?

1169
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:10,125
We're going.
- We left long ago. Come.

1170
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:18,583
What happened to you?

1171
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,083
You said there's ghost in house,
did you tell it'll hit us?

1172
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:24,125
Dogs will bite and ghosts will hit,
don't you know that as a police officer?

1173
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:26,167
Tell me, why are you behaving like this?

1174
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,125
Your activities are not good.

1175
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:32,292
As you said ghost thrashed my husband.

1176
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:33,708
You must come to chase it out.

1177
01:15:33,917 --> 01:15:35,292
I can only identify the ghost.

1178
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,708
There's a man in Darga to chase it away.

1179
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:41,375
What happened to you?

1180
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,042
Any hormonal problem?
Let's consult a doctor.

1181
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,917
I'm sparing you because
you're a girl, go away.

1182
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,875
I'll not go.
Come with me.

1183
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,542
Don't know what's happening here!

1184
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,583
What happened to you?
- Don't touch her.

1185
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,833
What's this a girl here?
- Our son's class mate.

1186
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,333
Why did she come here?

1187
01:16:04,542 --> 01:16:05,792
Are we running tuition centre here?

1188
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:06,875
How would I know?

1189
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:09,917
He's not a boy any more,
he has become a woman.

1190
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:12,625
What?
- Please save him.

1191
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:14,833
Please save my son.

1192
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,458
Come.

1193
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:21,167
Allah, give me power to destroy
this ghost.

1194
01:16:26,042 --> 01:16:29,250
Allah, chase out the ghost!

1195
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,042
Don't get scared.

1196
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,250
Why is he coming flying?

1197
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:44,875
Ghost!

1198
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:51,042
Are you here to destroy me instead
of warding of evil from shops?

1199
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:55,292
I'll spare your life, go away.

1200
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,958
If not I'll reduce you to ashes.

1201
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:58,917
Who are you, devil?

1202
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:04,958
I'll not leave this place without
arresting you in this with Allah's grace.

1203
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,333
Are you here to fight with me?
Come on!

1204
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:23,208
Chase out this devil!

1205
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:24,167
Do you know what this is?

1206
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:30,250
This is sword blessed by Allah a
fter fulfilling a vow.

1207
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:33,083
I'll destroy you, devil.

1208
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,000
If you don't tell me who you are...

1209
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:38,167
I'll tie you with this.
-Don't do it, bhai.

1210
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:40,583
Don't do it, bhai.

1211
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:41,625
Who are you?

1212
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:45,167
Don't chase me out from this body.

1213
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:48,042
No, bhai.
- Your game is over.

1214
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:51,250
My son...my son...

1215
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:56,042
If you don't tell me who you are,
I'll send you out of this world.

1216
01:17:56,292 --> 01:17:57,500
Shall I destroy you?

1217
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,375
Tell me, devil.

1218
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:04,292
My name is Pottu!

1219
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,458
Your attention please!

1220
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:19,583
Our village didn't get sun light
for 3 months now.

1221
01:18:19,792 --> 01:18:21,667
There's no word from Pottuamma.

1222
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:26,042
Today Pottuamma will speak to us!

1223
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,875
This is order of headman!

1224
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:35,833
Pottuamma is here!

1225
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:50,042
Greetings, mother.

1226
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,792
If you remain silent further,
this village can't survive.

1227
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:56,875
People here live on your hope only,
give a good message to people here.

1228
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:57,708
Come, mother.

1229
01:18:57,917 --> 01:19:01,042
Sit on the throne of God and
give a good message to people, mother.

1230
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,625
Pottuamma, protect us, mother!

1231
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:08,042
Give us good message, mother.

1232
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:11,583
Our village is in darkness,
shed light on us, mother.

1233
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:23,125
Tomorrow morning,
sun will shed light on our village.

1234
01:19:23,542 --> 01:19:24,708
Agriculture will prosper.

1235
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,250
Hunger will go away from here.

1236
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:29,042
This is Goddess's voice!

1237
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:32,667
Mother Pottuamma!

1238
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:37,708
Without sun light for 3 months.

1239
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:41,750
People slept peacefully hoping
my word will come true next day.

1240
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:52,750
Pottuamma's word has come true!

1241
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,500
Sun has risen!

1242
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:59,250
All of you come out and see!
Good times are here!

1243
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:27,250
Mother!

1244
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:29,250
You're manifestation of pure love...

1245
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:31,083
Mother, you're epitome of respect....

1246
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:35,833
Mother, you're paradigm of courage...

1247
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,750
Mother....Goddess of Trident...

1248
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:44,583
Mother, Goddess Kali...

1249
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:46,583
You're our saviour and protector...

1250
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:50,292
Mother, you're our God Mother....

1251
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:59,958
We witnessed your divine charm,
we became your ardent devotees...

1252
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:03,917
Everything here is your grace...
O Mother....

1253
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:07,583
Gods will also come to seek
your blessings....

1254
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:13,917
You're an incarnation of Goddess...
O Mother...

1255
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:50,833
Even thunders and lightning
didn't scare you...

1256
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:54,500
People living in these hills
are your children...

1257
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:58,458
We lived here in peace
with animals and plants...

1258
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:02,208
No more bad days,
it's happiness all the way...

1259
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:09,750
We pray you like Goddess,
we're your devotees...

1260
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:18,333
You're our land, cattle and God...

1261
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:53,917
We came here dancing and
singing paeans about you...

1262
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:57,667
We're blessed that
you're among us, O Mother...

1263
01:22:57,833 --> 01:23:01,583
You're an epitome of love
and grace...

1264
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:05,083
We'll offer you divine offerings...

1265
01:23:05,292 --> 01:23:12,708
This is the happiest moment
for everyone here...

1266
01:23:12,917 --> 01:23:20,417
We live simple as per your advice...

1267
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:58,417
Mother!
What happened to you, mother?

1268
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:02,375
I don't know,
I feel like my body is burning.

1269
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:03,958
What's this new habit?

1270
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:07,125
Why did you bring doctor
from downhill for this, father?

1271
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:10,583
I didn't call him,
he came here to meet you.

1272
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:13,125
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1273
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:16,750
It was very difficult to reach
your mountain village by car.

1274
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:23,667
But your daughter walked 20 kms
to study and topped the state.

1275
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:27,458
State topper will get first seat
in my college.

1276
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:32,875
It's my good fortune to admit such
a brilliant student in my college.

1277
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:34,917
What are you trying to say, sir?

1278
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:38,958
Medical education has become
business now, I'm doing it as service.

1279
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:44,125
You must join my medical college and
become a doctor to serve 27 villages here.

1280
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:45,292
That's my wish.

1281
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,083
Forgive me for refusing your offer, sir.

1282
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,250
I'm blessed to be born here.

1283
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:55,167
I studied plus 2 to teach
children here to study.

1284
01:24:55,667 --> 01:24:58,208
I don't like to go to city to study.

1285
01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:00,458
Please go away without
any further discussion.

1286
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:02,667
Entire village considers you
as Goddess.

1287
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:06,417
Shouldn't you serve these
people as doctor?

1288
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:09,375
Doctor, you said Pottuamma
is Goddess to us.

1289
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:12,000
Just her divine touch is enough
to get rid of diseases.

1290
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:13,542
You can go, sir.

1291
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:18,750
You came this far for her,
but we can't go against her word.

1292
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:21,375
Mind your work, please.
Go.

1293
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:23,583
Why are they refusing a golden chance?

1294
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,000
Don't know what happened?

1295
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:28,917
Someone got hurt.

1296
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,750
Put the cot here.

1297
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,125
Careful!

1298
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:33,083
Open your eyes, dear.

1299
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,958
Father!
- What's it, dear?

1300
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,667
Don't know what happened?

1301
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:40,292
How did it happen?
- Please give me way.

1302
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,875
What happened to my child?

1303
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:46,250
She was playing normally,
suddenly she fell unconscious.

1304
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:48,125
What are you waiting for?

1305
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:50,542
Get herbal doctor from
downhill immediately

1306
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:51,917
Wait....where's Pachamalai?

1307
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:54,500
Just 32 miles from here, sir.
- 32 miles?

1308
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:56,417
She'll die meanwhile.

1309
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:59,958
Can I treat her?
- Sir, we'll do it in our way.

1310
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:01,083
Child's condition is serious.

1311
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:02,500
Wait, let him check.
You treat her, sir.

1312
01:26:02,667 --> 01:26:04,458
Get me emergency box.

1313
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:08,333
Serious head injury.

1314
01:26:24,667 --> 01:26:26,583
Sir, you saved my child.

1315
01:26:28,292 --> 01:26:29,792
Nothing has happened to you.

1316
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,083
Give her some water.

1317
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,375
Thank you, sir.
You saved a child's life.

1318
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:37,333
I didn't save her,
medicine saved her life.

1319
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:41,583
Only a doctor knows what medicine
to administer to save a patient.

1320
01:26:42,792 --> 01:26:44,708
It is important to educate children.

1321
01:26:44,917 --> 01:26:47,500
It is more important
to save a life, right?

1322
01:26:47,667 --> 01:26:49,708
One can walk 20 kms to study.

1323
01:26:49,917 --> 01:26:53,583
Can one walk 32 miles to save a life?

1324
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,750
Time is very important for
medical treatment.

1325
01:26:55,917 --> 01:26:56,708
Think over it.

1326
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:59,083
Mother, you must study medicine.

1327
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:05,417
Yes, you must study, mother.

1328
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:06,583
Calm down, please.

1329
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:09,042
Say you will study, mother!

1330
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:11,000
I'll study for your sake.

1331
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,042
Greetings, doctor!

1332
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,750
Sir, please save our brother.

1333
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:35,042
One who tries to save a life is doctor.
But only God saves!

1334
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,125
I got phone that patient is serious,
I'll try my level best.

1335
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:40,167
Be brave...be brave...

1336
01:27:41,292 --> 01:27:44,167
Mother, please save Karuppaiah.

1337
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:47,250
What happened to Karuppaiah?
-He suddenly fell unconscious.

1338
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:51,250
If doctor hadn't come there,
my brother would've died by now.

1339
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:53,333
Yes, mother.
- I'll meet dean.

1340
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:57,958
Pulse rate is getting down...

1341
01:27:59,917 --> 01:28:02,083
Dean, Karuppaiah...

1342
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:06,875
Patient's condition is very serious.

1343
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:11,542
Head injury has affected his cerebellum
and he has lost his memory power.

1344
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,417
You're a medical student,
you can understand it well.

1345
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:25,708
If his body organs are donated,
he can give new life to many patients.

1346
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:30,667
You must tell and convince them.
- How can I?

1347
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,583
I beg you as a doctor.

1348
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,250
Please help few others to live longer.

1349
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:36,750
You don't have to beg.

1350
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,542
We know whatever you do
is for our benefit only.

1351
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:41,958
Can I meet Karuppaiah one last time?

1352
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:44,167
Time is running short,
go, meet him.

1353
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:28,667
No one is allowed inside,
operation is in progress.

1354
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:30,375
Nurse, leave her.
- I must meet him.

1355
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:33,250
Come, Pottu.
- He's still alive.

1356
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:35,125
He called me now.

1357
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:38,750
Nothing has happened to him,
please save his life.

1358
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:42,458
It's all over! Sorry.

1359
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:01,667
Hubby...hubby...

1360
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:02,667
What's it?

1361
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:09,792
I fear of losing our elder daughter Pottuamma
and younger daughter Ponniyamma.

1362
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:11,250
Why do you feel like that?

1363
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:13,667
Something wrong is happening
in the college Pottu is studying.

1364
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:17,208
Four people from our village
went there for treatment,

1365
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:18,917
all of them returned dead.

1366
01:30:19,125 --> 01:30:21,792
You got our younger daughter also
admitted in the same hospital.

1367
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,667
I'm scared, let's go and
bring back our daughters.

1368
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:26,250
Don't talk as if you've seen the unseen.

1369
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:28,708
Elder daughter must become doctor.
Younger daughter must get well.

1370
01:30:28,917 --> 01:30:29,958
That's why I'm struggling, right?

1371
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:33,333
You got me admitted into the
hospital for a small wound.

1372
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:34,917
They killed me too!

1373
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:46,792
What are you saying, father?

1374
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,750
Your mother appeared in dream
and warned me.

1375
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:50,292
I don't think it is not safe for you
to study here.

1376
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,042
Patients weren't admitted at right time.

1377
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,000
That's why they died because
of complications.

1378
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:58,083
The day you left village,
God has stopped speaking to us.

1379
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:04,875
I feel we lost the power of foreseeing the
future because of your studies in city.

1380
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:08,458
Enough of what we've lost.
We mustn't lose your sister too.

1381
01:31:08,667 --> 01:31:11,292
Nothing will happen to sister,
doctor will surely save her.

1382
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,292
No, mother.

1383
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,167
You're talking like a doctor
not as our Goddess.

1384
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:19,625
That's why you're unable to understand
what we feel as bad!

1385
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:22,250
Okay, let's see sister, father.

1386
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:23,792
Okay.
- Come.

1387
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:29,750
Sister is fine, right?

1388
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:34,958
Father, sister's pulse rate is normal.
There's no danger to her life.

1389
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:39,083
I think someone is coming.

1390
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,833
If they see others in ICU ward,
they'll scold me.

1391
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,375
Hide quickly.
- Okay.

1392
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:55,458
Dr.Somasundaram sent us here.

1393
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:58,458
You're the duty doctor, right?
- Yes.

1394
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:02,375
This patient's heart must be sent
to Dubai by today 11.30 AM flight.

1395
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:11,333
Wait outside, they'll come now.

1396
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:21,667
What's it, dear?

1397
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:25,250
Something illegal is going on here
without Dean's knowledge, father.

1398
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:28,000
We must inform him, pick up sister.

1399
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:30,458
This side, father.

1400
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,167
Come, Pottu! What happened?

1401
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:36,750
Dean, we're coming to meet you.

1402
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:39,542
They're planning to harvest
my sister's heart.

1403
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:42,667
Something illegal is going on here
without your knowledge.

1404
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:49,667
Doctor, our entire village
considered you as God.

1405
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:51,833
You cheated us, doctor.

1406
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,208
Did I say I'm God?

1407
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:55,708
Did I?

1408
01:32:57,792 --> 01:32:59,542
Is he in our list?
- No, sir.

1409
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:02,208
Then, throw him out of this compound.

1410
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,250
Sir, no please...

1411
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:14,625
Do whatever you want with me,
please don't harm her.

1412
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:16,208
Come, man!

1413
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:22,667
Father!

1414
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:28,667
Mother!

1415
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:29,958
Father!

1416
01:33:30,167 --> 01:33:32,625
Get their throne!

1417
01:33:38,667 --> 01:33:40,917
Throne of Pottuamma!

1418
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:44,875
He's sitting on the throne of our God...

1419
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:50,125
I had come to your village and
begged you to study medicine,

1420
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,167
do you know why?

1421
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,250
For Bombay blood group heart!

1422
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:55,000
That's my business.

1423
01:33:55,208 --> 01:33:59,792
Are you surprized how I knew people
in your village had Bombay blood group?

1424
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:02,875
Run...run...public announcement!

1425
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:05,833
Your attention please!

1426
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,833
To prevent various fevers!

1427
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,417
To treat and give free medicines,

1428
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:14,667
city Doctor is here,

1429
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:20,083
get your blood tested,
this is headman's order!

1430
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:22,833
Come, get your blood test done.

1431
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,583
So many in a mountain village are
having Bombay blood group.

1432
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:35,958
What's Bombay blood group?

1433
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:39,375
In 1952 an accident happened
in Bombay,

1434
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:45,875
patient who was fighting death,
no blood matched his blood group.

1435
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:48,667
only then medical fraternity came
to know about new blood group.

1436
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:52,083
Medically it is known as HH,
some call it as OH.

1437
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:55,500
Since it was discovered in Bombay,
it is known as Bombay blood.

1438
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:58,667
Many had died without getting
this rare blood group.

1439
01:34:58,792 --> 01:35:02,792
Dean, you cheated us with this
divine profession of medicine.

1440
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,375
Don't you've a heart?
- No!

1441
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:08,833
A Bombay blood group heart
is worth Rs.7 crores!

1442
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,917
Would I leave it?

1443
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:14,958
Only 70000 people in this world
have this blood group.

1444
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:16,917
Your mountain village is worth
hundreds of cores.

1445
01:35:17,083 --> 01:35:19,042
I know the medical value,
would I let go the opportunity?

1446
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:21,833
I wanted to play the game
with you as main player.

1447
01:35:22,042 --> 01:35:24,375
So I decided to give you seat
in my college.

1448
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:27,292
But you and your father
refused my offer.

1449
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,375
That's why I used your sister
as pawn to get your approval.

1450
01:35:29,542 --> 01:35:36,250
Ice boys....
- Children, play carefully.

1451
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:40,042
Ponni, Selvi is hiding in street.

1452
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,250
You're here, right?

1453
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:48,958
7 people of your village
didn't die naturally.

1454
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:49,875
We've done blood test to all of them.

1455
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:52,583
Doctor! Greetings, sir.

1456
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,250
How are you, Karuppaiah?
- I'm fine, sir.

1457
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:59,333
Tell me if I've to announce anything,
blood will freeze if I'm jobless, right?

1458
01:35:59,542 --> 01:36:01,667
He's talking about blood with us.

1459
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:04,125
Is he in our list?
- I'll check, doctor.

1460
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:05,917
I asked just a job.
Why are they thinking so much?

1461
01:36:06,083 --> 01:36:08,708
He's seventh in our list.
- Let's make him our first victim.

1462
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:09,750
Get ready injection.

1463
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:12,250
Brother, come here.
- Sir...coming, sir.

1464
01:36:13,917 --> 01:36:14,667
Tell me, sir.

1465
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:16,750
Your public announcements
are not that loud.

1466
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:17,833
Open your mouth.

1467
01:36:18,542 --> 01:36:20,167
Open your mouth again.

1468
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:25,667
You, your father and
your sister are next in the list.

1469
01:36:25,833 --> 01:36:27,250
Father...sister...

1470
01:36:27,625 --> 01:36:32,125
Using you, I'll harvest Bombay blood
group organs from 27 villages.

1471
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:34,542
I thought I'll take your heart after that.

1472
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:37,875
But fate has decided to kill you earlier.

1473
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:40,333
I went for your father to village,
they said he's here.

1474
01:36:40,542 --> 01:36:42,000
That's why I brought this chair also.

1475
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:46,375
It seems you talk to your people
sitting on this throne.

1476
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:48,833
No need of doing it anymore.

1477
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:53,542
Customers are waiting for
the hearts of your family.

1478
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:58,292
We don't come down from mountains
because of people like you.

1479
01:36:59,417 --> 01:37:05,000
Our God will keep an account
of your sins.

1480
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:07,667
Take him to operation theatre.

1481
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,333
Doctor, there's still life in the
dead body on operation table.

1482
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,083
Come and see.
- What are you saying?

1483
01:37:33,292 --> 01:37:35,250
It's respiring....come...
Come...come...- Go.

1484
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,000
Look at this, doctor!

1485
01:37:38,167 --> 01:37:40,792
How could she breathe?
How?

1486
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:46,917
We've harvested all her organs.
This is medical miracle.

1487
01:37:50,333 --> 01:37:55,792
I didn't die even after they took
away all my body organs.

1488
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:06,500
He brought a sorceress to arrest me.

1489
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:09,500
That's Brahmeshwari!

1490
01:38:10,042 --> 01:38:11,958
How much time has passed
since you removed her heart?

1491
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:13,542
4 hours.

1492
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:15,708
Still not pacified!

1493
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:22,458
RK, you entered troubled waters
without knowing the depth.

1494
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:23,542
What should I do now?

1495
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:28,750
I can arrest even the vilest spirit.

1496
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:34,333
It is very difficult to keep under
control such a divine soul.

1497
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:36,375
Hail Goddess Kali!

1498
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:41,417
I must arrest under the
spell of divine hymn.

1499
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,667
Bury her.

1500
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:50,292
I'm going to arrest her soul using
every evil spirit at my disposal.

1501
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:58,458
Evil spirits in this cremation must stand guard
and shouldn't allow her to leave this place.

1502
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:06,458
Let these divine amulets become
shackles and tie her down here.

1503
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:09,750
Close the ditch before
the fire dies down.

1504
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:10,667
We will!

1505
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:18,542
What was her blood group?
- Bombay blood.

1506
01:39:19,042 --> 01:39:26,333
0Not a drop of same blood group
must fall on her grave.

1507
01:39:26,542 --> 01:39:27,375
If it touches?

1508
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:31,583
Evil soul will break free from
the divine shackles.

1509
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:35,125
I brought you here to save my life.

1510
01:39:35,292 --> 01:39:38,083
I can't spend my life guarding
this cremation ground.

1511
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:48,167
This is divine stone I got after 14 years of
penance and blessed by King Cobra!

1512
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:53,792
No evil spirit can harm you
till this is on you.

1513
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,083
Wear it.
- Give me.

1514
01:39:57,250 --> 01:40:00,958
I came with great hope
to become a doctor.

1515
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:05,875
But that sinner killed me brutally
for my Bombay blood group heart.

1516
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:13,625
I and my family members were around
the college to get released.

1517
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:18,167
He entered the college,
through his blood...

1518
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:20,083
I got this body.

1519
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:26,042
Fearing doctor would kill him if he comes t
o know he has Bombay blood group.

1520
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:30,917
I changed his records in college.

1521
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:34,375
She changed blood reports also,
how smart she is!

1522
01:40:34,583 --> 01:40:36,792
He too belongs to Bombay blood group!

1523
01:40:37,042 --> 01:40:39,667
Had you know this,
you would've killed him also, right?

1524
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,042
Bhai...no...don't split me from this body.

1525
01:40:44,417 --> 01:40:47,125
He's very bad man!

1526
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:53,500
Till I kill him, please don't force me
to leave this body.

1527
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:57,833
I can't accept you torturing him and
his family for your personal revenge.

1528
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,833
Even if I spare you,
that evil sorceress will not space you.

1529
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:03,375
9 planets, 27 starts!

1530
01:41:03,583 --> 01:41:08,708
I want a man born on full moon day
and lunar eclipse day,

1531
01:41:08,917 --> 01:41:10,833
with star of Mrigaseera!

1532
01:41:11,042 --> 01:41:14,042
Guru, you're reading my horoscope.

1533
01:41:16,667 --> 01:41:21,708
You betrayed me though
I was always loyal to you.

1534
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:25,375
Why did you kill him?
- I can save you only if I kill him.

1535
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:29,708
His soul will bring back Pottu's soul.
Go!

1536
01:41:32,625 --> 01:41:35,917
Pottu! Did you blind me?

1537
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:40,875
No! Please don't anything!

1538
01:41:41,042 --> 01:41:42,958
Please tell her not to harm my son.

1539
01:41:43,167 --> 01:41:49,667
If you try to do anything now,
I'll take him also with me.

1540
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:51,917
Please tell her not to harm
my son, please....

1541
01:41:52,125 --> 01:41:53,208
Save my son.
- Don't do anything.

1542
01:41:53,417 --> 01:41:56,250
The only thing I have is this body.
Shall I destroy it?

1543
01:41:56,417 --> 01:41:57,667
I'll give you 3 days time,

1544
01:41:57,875 --> 01:42:00,292
finish your job by full moon day
and leave his body.

1545
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:02,250
Promise on Allah!

1546
01:42:02,792 --> 01:42:03,958
Promise!

1547
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:06,458
Promise!

1548
01:42:15,917 --> 01:42:17,167
What happened to you, sir?

1549
01:42:18,917 --> 01:42:19,542
What happened?

1550
01:42:19,708 --> 01:42:20,958
Sorceress took away your son.

1551
01:42:21,167 --> 01:42:22,375
Did sorceress take away my son?

1552
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:23,500
Who is it?

1553
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:31,167
You sent him to bring me, right?
I brought him to you.

1554
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:34,500
I'll bring curtains down to your game.

1555
01:42:34,667 --> 01:42:37,542
You can never do it.
- Are you challenging me?

1556
01:42:37,667 --> 01:42:38,625
Look at this!

1557
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:45,958
This evil spirit must die before
this day changes.

1558
01:42:50,167 --> 01:42:51,750
You can't break it.

1559
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:56,917
Don't support injustice!
Leave me

1560
01:42:57,125 --> 01:42:58,833
I arrested you in a vessel.

1561
01:42:59,042 --> 01:43:03,250
I'll bury you deep in sea
crossing seven seas.

1562
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:08,458
No, he left that sinner.
He'll destroy our entire village.

1563
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:12,833
Don't stop me, allow me to kill him.

1564
01:43:15,458 --> 01:43:19,417
Sister, he took away my heart
when I was still alive.

1565
01:43:19,625 --> 01:43:20,875
Don't protect him.

1566
01:43:21,083 --> 01:43:23,750
Can't a mother's heart
understand our pain?

1567
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,583
Come out!

1568
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:40,417
Don't destroy me....I must kill him.

1569
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:42,417
No...no..

1570
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:48,958
Fall at the feet of Goddess Pottuamman
in mountains to save your son.

1571
01:43:55,625 --> 01:44:11,125
O Goddess Mother!
Saviour of this world!

1572
01:44:22,375 --> 01:44:26,042
Goddess of mountains,
Consort of Lord Shiva....

1573
01:44:26,208 --> 01:44:33,333
Goddess riding on tiger...

1574
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:30,250
Goddess, your grace can
soothe any pain...

1575
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:34,083
Goddess, come and save a soul...

1576
01:45:34,292 --> 01:45:38,042
Your blessing can change
fate and betrayal...

1577
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:41,375
Come to change the
power of arrogance...

1578
01:45:41,583 --> 01:45:45,083
Come with divine trident
to destroy evil...

1579
01:45:45,292 --> 01:45:50,125
Come to protect and save us...

1580
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:27,583
Hail Goddess Kali!

1581
01:46:55,042 --> 01:46:58,250
Let justice prevail...
Save a life, O Mother...

1582
01:46:58,458 --> 01:47:02,500
Hear our prayers and
show us the right path...

1583
01:47:02,667 --> 01:47:05,958
Mother, you will come
to fulfill our wish...

1584
01:47:06,167 --> 01:47:09,750
You're the power house to create
or destroy anything...

1585
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:31,917
Where is he?

1586
01:49:03,333 --> 01:49:07,458
Our God will keep an account
of your sins.

1587
01:49:15,708 --> 01:49:16,417
Get up!

1588
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,958
SheÅfs seething with rage to avenge you!

1589
01:49:19,792 --> 01:49:21,417
Don't get scared!

1590
01:49:21,625 --> 01:49:24,958
I'll save your life risking my life!

1591
01:49:26,333 --> 01:49:29,917
Come....come...

1592
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:57,125
Come....

1593
01:50:23,917 --> 01:50:26,625
Are you playing with me?

1594
01:50:38,375 --> 01:50:39,167
Come on!

1595
01:50:47,625 --> 01:50:48,875
What happened, Brahmeshwari?

1596
01:50:49,042 --> 01:50:51,833
He stabbed me, but I'll not spare him.

1597
01:50:51,917 --> 01:50:53,083
She's no ordinary woman,

1598
01:50:53,292 --> 01:50:55,375
I was her trusted lieutenant
but she killed me too!

1599
01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:58,542
I'll transfer my soul into your body!

1600
01:51:00,292 --> 01:51:01,167
Kill him!
