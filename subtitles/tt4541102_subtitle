00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,893
Jai Hind sir.

And sir, how‘s the case going?
- Feeling shy to remove clothes?

6
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,876
Received the order to keep them
in custody for eight days’?

7
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,956
Sir, are they really criminals?

8
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,260
Mostly innocents arrive here,
and then they turn criminals from here.

9
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,094
When it comes to these boys..

10
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,095
..they must not
face any trouble in here.

11
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,494

00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,103
You can‘t do anything.

18
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,910
Hey, you get lost.

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,817

Come here.. here.. here..

23
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,670
Kabbadi!
- You are of no use, idiot.

24
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:32,008
Very good VT.
Catch him, son.

25
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,205
Catch his leg and
drop him down with full force.

26
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,411
Hey.. we won.. we won.

27
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,817
They are doing cheating.
- I did nothing, go now.

28
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:47,382
They are doing cheating.
- We are not doing any cheating. Move!

29
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,003
His pant was left over there.

30
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,664
Didn‘t you get thrashed’?
Then why are you laughing?

31
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,336
Yeah! But I had said it earlier that
during trouble first pray to god.

32
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,107
Or else god will leave you.

33
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,514
Do remember,
entire school beat us together.

34
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,882
So we will take vengeance
with the entire school.

35
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,319
That too in such manner
that it will change entire scenario.

36
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,551

t‘s fine. Over there it was Lord Hanuman
who had set Lanka on fire..

37
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,251
..here it will be Salman
who will be setting Lanka on fire.

38
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,922
Praise the lord.

Crazy fellow!
You made the teacher fall. Can‘t you see’?

45
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,966
You are talking about pushing her,
they have attacked us from there.

46
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:42,773
They saw us.
- They are bursting some cheap crackers.

47
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,574
Let‘s run!

48
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,240

Earlier we were best friends.

00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,047
And now our
children are best friends.

108
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,218
Hi, brother!

116
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,038
The fees is little too high.

117
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,441
But the management
and environment over there is amazing.

118
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,977
They‘

 come out as something from there.

119
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,277
Sure! Sure!

00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,181
Thank you!
- Come with me, have some tea and snacks.

121
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,916
Fludra brother,

Excuse me!

00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,794
You are standing here.
He was asking for you from long time.

00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,864

00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,772
Why’? Why shall I talk to you’?
- Just like that.

00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,176
I don‘t talk to
anyone for no reason.

131
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,270
But I talk to everyone
without any reason, brother.

133
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,947
Madam, I swear, 
‘ve never
been proud of myself since childhood.

134
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,978
Look yourselves, both of you.

135
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,351
Look at your shoes.

136
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,350
A man‘s thoughts depend
on the kind of shoes he buys.

137
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,027
What does that mean?

138
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:18,968
A person‘s status is know from his shoes,
and not from his face.

139
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,936
Stupid!

140
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,741
Excuse me madam!
-What’?

141
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,538
250 rupees.
First copy, Palika Bazaar.

142
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,874
Shut up!

143
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,672
Shut up?

144
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,411
Brother, I means.

145
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,748
Brother, I swear I will fall.
My mind has gone mad.

146
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,117
She went by saying shut up.

147
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,155
Brother, don‘t say so.

148
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,088
I think something has happened.

149
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,900
Hey.. Sherwani!

150
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,235
Where are you from’?
- I do have invitation.

151
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,435

0k.
- Oh my god!

153
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,369
What?
- Who gave you’?

154
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,506
What do you want to do’?
- Hey..!

155
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,878
I have to do.

156
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,077
Our relative wedding, at my house.
And you are going crazy.

157
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,849
Oh, brother!
- Hey, idiots. - This house is mine.

158
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,253
We don‘t require any invitations.

159
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,655
It doesn‘t seem that
this house belongs to you people.

160
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,216
You cheap guys.
- What are you saying?

161
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,956
Fool! 
‘m the Salman of UP.

162
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,157
We don‘t take time to beat anyone.
- Really?

163
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,692
Leave it.. leave it Salman.
- Show me your guts.

164
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,499
Leave it, Salman. Leave it.
- Okay.

165
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,810
You are not beating me
as you fear me.

166
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,539
Really?
- Yes.

167
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,047
Oye! Nothing like that..

168
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,978
..our Anil is enough for you.

169
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,848
Come here son. come here.
- Anil’? Is it’?

170
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,951
Leave some place.

171

I can‘t longer keep your children

194
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,707
You please forgive me.

195
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,679
Do you know,

196
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,723
Oh God! Earlier they just used

Hey“ you just shut up.

Did you ever try to find out
what your children do’?

Did you ever go to school and find out’?
- What happened’?

Do they even come to the school or not’?

You have no time

Just shut your mouth.

210
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,521
Get up.

Don‘t you have any shame’?
Put your hands down.

212
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,389
If you all are not interested in studies.

213
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,332
Then why are you wasting
your parents‘ money’?

214

What happened’? Why are you all quiet’?

215

00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,700

I heard good things about your school.

226
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,446
Good morning boys.
-Greetings sir.

227
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,378
Now I even saw it.

228
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:31,945
I want these children to study here.

229
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,621
And learn from you.

230
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:39,485
In last five years,
our school has had a CBSE topper thrice.

231
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,890
Wow! Thafs very exciting.

232
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:46,670
But.. - And we haven‘t earned this status
only because of good studies.

233
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,838
Instead, the real reason behind this is..

234
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,647
..discip
ine.

235
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,042
Does this come out or not’?
- It will come out.

236
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:08,117
We always try to make sure that every
student in here follow the rules strictly.

237
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,251
Put it down and put on the button.

238
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,599
We ignore small mistakes.

239
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,562
But we don‘t let these mistakes
turn into habifs.

240
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,406
These children are bit different.

241
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,135
Would you like to have tea or coffee’?

242
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,337
No. thanks. 
‘m fine.

243
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,448
Guys, would you like to have something?
- No!

244
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,576
Good!

245
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,517
We handle children with love.

246
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:40,654
Remove it.

247
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,158
And if by any reason
the amount of love decreases.

248
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,161
..then we even charge fine.

249
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,962
You made me happy.

250
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,907
Do whatever you like.

251
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,935
But children should be safe.

252
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,569
They should be happily walking around.

253
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,747
Boys, go down stairs
and collect your uniforms.

254
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,141
Okay?
- Yes.

255
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,642
<i>Idiots, take blessings.</i>

257
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,215

and in right hands.

261
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,364
You stay relaxed.
- Thank you so much.

262
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,297
Pal, you got me trapped.

263
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,940
Grandfather, we are not interested
to study in this prison like school.

264

265
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,307
Grandfather, please.
Just listen to me for a minute.

266
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,575
We can‘t see anyone in this school,
grandfather.

267
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,343
You can‘t see children
as the school got over.

268
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,815
Children will go home, right’?

269
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,884
But grandfather there‘s
plenty of rules in here.

270

Then go and come fast.

00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,164

Brother, it‘s been decided.

..

283
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,826
Idiot, how mean and greedy you are.
You only think about yourself.

00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,693
Stupid, look at her sexy madam.

285
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,834

brother was seeing madam.

Good morning boys and girls.
- Good morning sir.

You are the torch bearers of tomorrow.
The hope for the future.

00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,452
And you are the light
and the sun for the times to come.

295
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:34,822
And if you wish, and if you concentrate
then you can do everything.

296
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,567
There shou
dn‘t be any word
as impossible in your dictionary.

297
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,198
Because nothing is impossible.

..if you want to. You can.

299
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,709

Your thoughts, your faith.

303

Your angle of sight
and your behavior can only be the change.

304
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,688
And if you do wish for change.

305
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,764
..then you shall
start it first with yourself.

306

355
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:49,092

Make mother sleep here
and see Jyoti from here.

360
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,998
No one will laugh on their stupidity.

361
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,600
Did I say something wrong?

362
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,574
‘Don‘t ask a sage his status.‘
- Brother, don‘t know what happened.

363
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,638
They should tell the right answer. - I had
told you about another proverb yesterday.

364
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,974
That is the reason
we both are standing outside.

00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,750
Status.

00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,324
You are looking good. Sir!

367
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:30,732
‘Don‘t ask a sage his status.‘

368
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,764
Sir, look there.

369
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,137
Take it. You take it.

370
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,830
So what does it mean?

371
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,035
Now you‘

 get punished severely.

372
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:44,104
Go away baldy.
- I will make his omelette.

373
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,486
Dude, if you like Pooja so much
then why don‘t you tell her’?

374
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,882
Are you scared’?

375
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,558
Listen brother,

‘m not scared of any one.

376
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,558
And If I go crazy..

I didn‘t do it purposely.

380
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,828
Remove your hands.
Stupid, blind, idiot.

381
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:10,840
Bloody villagers.
- What are you doing? Are you mad’?

382
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,370
You are blind’?
Can‘t you walk be seeing properly?

383
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,908
Idiots.

384
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,847
Dude, why does
this happen to me all time.

385
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,514
When I saw you, I had this thought.

386
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,282
Life‘s like sunlight

387
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,258
You fatso,

One minute! one minute!

390
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,827
This is not nitrogen,
oxygen and hydrogen.

391
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,230
That you mix them all
and create water.

392
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,403
Yes Salman.
- This ma‘am.

393
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,112
Emotion, it‘s matter of heart.

394
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,170
Expression, you know expression?

395
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,977

Berry and gold, if you eat it and get it..
Understood’?

00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,893
Man gets crazy.

Kumar Sir,

401
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:13,299
Don‘t give incomplete knowledge.
Can you explain with full details? please!

402
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,934
Listen!
- I will give you on example.

403
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,007
Kanak!

404
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,406

00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,677
Kanak!
-Yes, Kanak!

407
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:34,851
No.. no.. no. 
‘m just explaining
this guy about ‘alankaaf (adorning).

408
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,524
Alankaar’?
- Yes! Yes!

409
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,253
Alankaar is such that..

410
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,236
Wow.. wow! Wow.. wow!

411
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:54,500
Kumar sir, you don‘t know anything.

412
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,313
You try to act smart unnecessarily.

413
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,578
<i>
‘

</i> surely make Kanak observe fast of
‘Karva Chauth‘ for me..

414
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,216
..then you can change my name.

415
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,189
What are you doing?

416
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,130
No, nothing.

417
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,565
Are you polishing every shoes’?

418
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,045
I can‘t get it.
You haven‘t done this ever before.

419
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,944
A saint has said that..

420
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,516
A man‘s status can be seen
by the shine on his shoes.

421
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,813
So that‘s the reason
that I was polishing all these shoes.

422
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:39,253
ls it’? And I have heard that..

423
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:42,986
..when a person gets thrashed by shoes,
then he comes to know his status.

424
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,493
Before you get to know your status.

425
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,052
..go away from here.

426
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,961
And concentrate on studies.
-But..

427
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,833
Scholars have said,
you have to know the status.

428
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:04,045
"You are the lord and
master of the universe."

429
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:08,846
"The whole world is yours."

430
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:13,648
"The whole world is yours."

431
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:18,860
"You are the lord and
master of the universe."

432
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:23,866
"The whole world is yours."
- Sir, what are you doing?

433
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,362
The prayers are on..

434
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,733
..by leaving god
you are heading to madam’?

435
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,937
Close your eyes.
You shut up.

436
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,670
"You are the lord and
master of the universe."

437
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,917
What a art.. Modern art.

438
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:50,388

00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:42,170
"The pea-hen is singing
in the garden at midnight."

451
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,437
You guys are looking beautiful.

By giving the feathers,
I made them a peacock.

460

Then whafs the difference
between you and them’?

461
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,540
Go to your class.

If you repeat it again,

How silent is this place.

The sound that tears silence.

483
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,617

How can I know? It should have exploded.
- How did you harass the girl’?

Come here. Come here.

Sir... sir.. he didn‘t cut his hair.

Did you get it’?
- Yes sir!

Sons are known as Vansh (family linage).

718
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,756
And daughters are known
as paras (bearers).

719
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:56,790
You know what paras means?

720
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,998
Paras means that thing.

721
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,000

If you have any problem

00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,380
..who in the world has
no problems in life.

727
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,749
Life is so wonderful,
why are you keen to ruin it.

728
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:27,588
Look at me.

What do you get
by in taking drugs’?

730
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,600
You are at that age where
you have to move further. So leave drugs.

731
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,831
Learn to love yourself.

732
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,681
Love yourself.

733
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,132
Devil.

00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,935

No, sir!

738
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,991
Look at her.

739
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,384
Raise your hands.

740
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:36,161
If your hands come down,

Oh man!
If there wasn‘t Pooja in this schoo
..

745
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:53,078
..then I would have
blew this school with a bomb.

746
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,715
Neither there will be bamboos,
nor there will be flutes.

747
00:47:56,774 --> 00:48:00,449
It will be over. - Dude, why do you
want to go to school for that’?

748
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:02,487
You can meet Pooja while passing
through that route.

749
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:03,990
And I will meet madam.

750
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:07,491
ls it so’? Then what about our studies?

751
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:09,456
What will you reply to grandfather?

752
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:12,091
Dude, grandfather
has paid Rs 1.30 lakh each.

753
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,730
We have to study.

754
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,826
What kind of study is on’?

755
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,400
We are like robots.

756
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:19,873
Yes, go here and do this
and go there do that.

757
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,467
Sometimes wear pant properly,
wear button properly, do this and do that.

758
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:23,839
They have put us trouble.

759
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,544
According to me says that..

760
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:31,044
Whatever has to say,
we will ask them.

761
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:38,383
Next time,
I will do something in school.

762
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,529
That everyone will join us.

763
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,967
Dude, this Air conditioned
bus has more fun, compared to school bus.

764
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:48,935
There is air conditioner.

765
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:49,970
We get to enjoy air conditioner..

766
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,267
..and we don‘t even require
to pay money for the same.

767
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,171
StOp!

Salman brother is always ready.
- Hey, that uncle looks bit worried.

They are not bothered
whether they have to attend school or not’?

778
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:49,228
That‘s the reason they
always arrive late, careless.

779
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,690
At least we are on time.

780
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,526

You won‘t believe.

They were playing with
the hand cart person‘s on highway.

797
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:34,904
They are not bothered.

798
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,104
They don‘t even have
tension of attending school.

799
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,944
They were pushing
the hand cart person‘s together.

800
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:43,281
Tell me.
As if they have all time in the world.

All frogs.

00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,613
Sifs.

t‘s good that I got to sit.

835
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:30,283
One. Two. Three.

836
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:35,628
Climb over me.

837
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:45,130
These five are so evil and naughty.

838
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,467
.. that they enjoy every punishment.

839
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,873
Nothing will happen with punishment.
I have made them cock 36 times.

840
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,579
Every time they follow this rule that,
there‘s something in us..

841
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,311
..that we are ill behaved and shameless.

842
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:57,681
What crap is it sir’?

843
00:52:57,775 --> 00:53:00,278
They are just wasting our
and their parents‘ time and money.

844
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,448
No, you haven‘t noticed their stamina.

845
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,554
You haven‘t seen their power..

846
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,184
..the hunger the to do something.

847
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,391
They make kheer (a sweet Indian dish)
with bu

ock‘s mi
k..

848
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,261
..and eat the same. Such is their hunger.
As they can do anything.

849
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,996
You are right sir.
They have hunger, only to eat food.

850
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:17,364
They have stamina to
wander doing nothing.

851
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,039
To fight at lanes.
And nothing else, sir.

852
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:22,168
They need a Dronacharya ( teacher).

853
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:24,975
Not Dronacharya,
but I can be Kalidas.

854
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:27,777
Now that Shankutala free me.
You are free person.

You go and become their Dronacharya.
Show them their proper way.

856
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:31,881

‘m telling you the truth.

857
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,717
The way will be yours,
but they will be putting the gear.

858
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:36,919
These guy will go too far.

859
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:41,253
Okay, I am leaving/
Do remember my words.

860
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,467
What‘s up’? Move a bit.

861
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,443
Why do you feel awkward with me’?
- No, I don‘t feel so.

Off course you do.

No. they can‘t stay sir.

Dude, 
‘m missing my family a lot.

929
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,444
Betal might be incomplete without me.

930
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,682
The way we are missing our fami
y..

931
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,823
..more than that our family
might be missing us.

932
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:45,142
Dad.

933
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:52,924
Dad, had I followed
what you said that day..

934
01:00:58,522 --> 01:01:00,263
..today Flam wou
dn‘t have been in jail.

935
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,799
Today Flam wou
dn‘t have been in jail.

936
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:09,274
Truth can be upset dear..

937
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:12,980
..but it never loses.

938
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,209
Diwan sir, you are trusting
that policeman too much.

939
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:19,921

t‘s been three days now..

940
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:22,218
We have no idea where our children are.

941
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:23,758
Will he even say something or not’?

942
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,622
You are thinking wrong.

943
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,490
Even his father will say.

944
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:28,995
Did you get it’?

945
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,388
What‘s the need to go his father’?

946
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,497
For that you have to follow
a long route.

947
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,965
If anything happens to our children.

948
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,701
Then no one
will be left to take your name.

949
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,136
You are getting worried.

950
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,875
Your children are
safe and sound with us.

951
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:50,915
And we have given them all comfort.

952
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,787
Nothing will happen to them.

953
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:57,224
No one gives a guarantee about life.
But 
‘m giving.

954
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:01,921
Your children are
safe, sound and alive.

955
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:08,528
4o.
-40.

956
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:15,065
43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.

957
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:28,444
Hey brother did you get to know
following which crime you are inside.

958
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:32,451
There are big rumors outside.
They might have did something big.

959
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:36,786
Very soon you will get to know,
how crime happens.

960
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,756
Am I right brothers’?

961
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:44,364
We are going.
- Are your legs swollen? Go inside.

962
01:03:45,756 --> 01:03:48,293
Go.
- 0k! 0k! Get inside.

963
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:53,240
You come here.
You too get inside.

964
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:57,935
Go inside.

965
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:16,625
Go.. go.

966
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,668
Enough daughter-in-law. Enough.

967
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:27,433
By shedding tears
don‘t make your son weak.

968
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:30,670
Dad, I can‘t tolerate it.

969
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,914
Look dear,
you have to tolerate it.

970
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:37,345
Because, whenever tears has
been shed from women‘s eyes.

971
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,714
It only has boiled men‘s blood.

972
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,222
And this is symbol of change.

973
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,918
Stay quiet.

974
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:46,292
Don‘t cry son.

975
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,991
Don‘t cry.
Everything will be alright.

976
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,564
Dad, don‘t be sad.

977
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:58,569
Now that 
‘m here,
who will take care of you’?

978
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,809
I won‘t drink.

979
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:05,070
Anyway, if fall after having the drink.

980
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:08,145
..then who will
carry me back home’?

981
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:14,286
Your Betal is all alone now.

982
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:18,055
No, you aren‘t a Betal.

983
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:20,556
You are my dad.

984
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,597
May dad.

985
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:27,965
Mom why are you worried’?

‘m absolutely fine.

986
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,130
You will do something.

987
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,801
..once my son grows
up he will do something.

988
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:35,873
Thafs what you used to say, right’?
Now see what he is doing.

989
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,337
He hasn‘t done anything wrong.

990
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,745
I believe him.

991
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,781
God won‘t let anything
bad happen to him.

992
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:47,920
Yes, god won‘t let anything
bad happen to him.

993
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,212
Get up. Get up, scoundrel.

994
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,274
To hell with you.

995
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:54,649
What are you doing? Let me go.
- Rascal.

996
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:58,391
If you are hungry then snatch the bread.

997
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,654
If you are naked then
snatch their clothes.

998
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:03,089
But never dishonor a woman.

999
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:08,124
Rascals.
- Show them, what is rape’?

1000
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,264
We haven‘t done anything.

1001
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,314
The police have come.
The police have come.

1002
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:30,323
The police.
- Stop fighting amongst yourselves.

1003
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:34,995
Let me go.
- Beat him. Beat him.

1004
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:37,161
Will you insult me so much’?

1005
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:40,131
Sir, see what they are doing.

1006
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,794
See what they are doing.

1007
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:43,303
Don‘t beat him.

1008
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,431
Yes, sir. He is very decent.

1009
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:47,973
Why are you holding him’?

1010
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:53,603
Lies. He is lying.
Let me go. I haven‘t done anything.

1011
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:57,512
Let me go.
Leave. I will kill you. Come back.

1012
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:58,878
He is liar.

1013
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:00,182
These kids are rapists.

1014
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:02,185
They have raped the society.

1015
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,890
Take them away from here.

1016
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:05,620
They are fit to be alive.
Take them away.

1017
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:07,388
Inspector, we haven‘t done anything.
- He is lying.

1018
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,554
Silence.

Silence!

1020
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:10,656
I don‘t want to hear anything.

1021
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:11,755
Take them.

1022
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:12,993
I haven‘t done anything.
- Go.

1023
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:14,763
Where are you taking us’?
We haven‘t done anything.

1024
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:17,099
Take them..
- Let me go. I won‘t go.

1025
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,833
This old man has done everything.
- Take them.

1026
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,072
Why are you taking us away?

1027
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,835
Sir.
- Let me go.

1028
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,579
I haven‘t done anything. Let me go.

1029
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,340
Let me go. I won‘t go.

Where are you taking me’?
Listen to me. Sir, please sir.

1032
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,852
Please. Sir, let me. Sir. Sir.

1033
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:44,092
What is our mistake?
Why have you caught us’?

1034
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:46,956
You.

1035
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,573
I have been running
this jail for ten years.

1036
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:56,973
And I won‘t tolerate this at all.

1037
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,744
Rot here for three days.

1038
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,617
You will get a pot of water for the day.

1039
01:09:08,044 --> 01:09:14,427
Wash with it or drink it.
Choice is yours.

1040
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,939
If we have not gone to study there..

1041
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:30,938
..a

 this wou
dn‘t have happened.

1042
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:33,139
By the way whose idea
was it to do combined study’?

1043
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,910
Dinbandhu suggested.
But it was Nisha‘s idea.

1044
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,945
Brother, trees are being
cut in the villages everyday..

1045
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,011
..and look at the city.

1046
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:46,185
"Invited me to tea."
- Look there.

1047
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:50,188
Thank you Ramuji. Welcome home, guys.

1048
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,960
Thafs my mom. Say hi.
- Hello aunty. - Hello aunty.

1049
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:56,594
That‘s the hall and that‘s the kitchen..

1050
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:59,003
..where you get all the
yummiest and the tastiest food.

1051
01:09:59,062 --> 01:10:02,168
And that‘s my room which
is the coolest room in the house.

1052
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:04,507
In Hindi.

1053
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:06,641
In short, consider it as your home.

1054
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:10,150
Oh no. Not at all.
Don‘t consider it as your home.

1055
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,014
You have come here to
study for seven days, right’?

1056
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:13,985
Study well.

1057
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:16,921
But after seven days
leave for your homes.

1058
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,219
..without breaking anything here. Okay?

1059
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,923
Did you understand what I am saying?

1060
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:26,095
In Hindi, did you understand me’?

1061
01:10:26,156 --> 01:10:28,762
Yes, we did.
- Thank God.

1062
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:31,797
Nisha, take them.

1063
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:33,065
Go. Go. Go.

1064
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,268
She has not told you to be so scared.

1065
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:43,712
By the way mom, this is Dinbandhu.

1066
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:52,217
What are you doing?
- Touching your feet.

1067
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,416
Why’?

1068
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:56,028
Culture.
- Nothing. Nothing. Go inside.

1069
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:58,965
Go inside.
Keep away your bags. Quick. Come on.

1070
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:03,037
Go inside.
- 
t‘s called food.

1071
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:06,531
Culture not food.

1072
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,577
Manners. Manners and all.
- Don‘t teach me manners.

1073
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:10,876
Go inside.

1074
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:13,277
You are so worried. 
t‘s not a lot.

1075
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,370
Its just seven days.

1076
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,347
I am boarding your
friends for seven days.

1077
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:20,246
I don‘t want any bad chat.
Okay? Control them.

1078
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,721
They look as if they
need to be controlled.

1079
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:33,792
If anyone is caught cheating
I will break his knees.

1080
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:35,427
What, sir’?

1081
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,202
I will break your mouth, son.

1082
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,667
Thank you, ma‘am.
- Ma‘am, paper.

1083
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,001
Sir, I have not received my paper.

1084
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:41,371
Son, you are not
going to write anything.

1085
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:42,671
Then why do you want to waste papers’?

1086
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:45,409
Write your exam papers quietly.

1087
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:49,144
There is less of time.
- Sir, I don‘t have pen.

1088
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:51,185
What do you have’? Tell me.

1089
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:53,981
Don‘t look around. Focus on your work.

1090
01:11:55,612 --> 01:12:00,925
Kids, behave like a couple later.
Write something.

1091
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,960
Sir, relax. Relax.
- God.

1092
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:07,360
Sir“
- What is this’?

1093
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,335

t‘s ticklish.

1094
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:13,940
One minute sir.

1095
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,604
Aren‘t you ashamed’?

1096
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:20,340
Are we done’?
Or is something still left’? Sit.

1097
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,282
Give it. No.

1098
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,785
Enough now.
When you cou
dn‘t write it in an hour.

1099
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:25,911
What will you write now in a minute’?

1100
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,852
How will just one

1101
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,750
Leave it kid. Leave it.

Sorry.
- Ma‘am, my Paper-

01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:31,958
Give it to me.

Leave it’?
- You.

1105
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,292
Bro, everything looks different.
What is it’? - Eat.

1106
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:40,067
Take something. Have vegetables.

1107
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:42,928
You are not eating, dear. Eat.

1108
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:45,632
No, aunty... Thank you.

1109
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:49,536
Everything will look blue
if you wear this at the table.

1110
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:54,411
Yes, aunty.
Thafs why everything looked blue.

1111
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,275
Its okay, mother.

1112
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,153
Goodness.

1113
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,418

t‘s okay. Ramu.

1114
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,691
Give me some pasta.
- Mother, eat.

1115
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:12,563
Give me.
- They are eating like hungry beasts.

1116
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,427
They are just enjoying the food. Eat.

1117
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:16,902
This is not how you enjoy food.

1118
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:21,175
This food is nice. ‘Nashta‘. ‘Nashta‘.

1119
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:24,835
This is not ‘nashta’. It is pasta.

1120
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,647
Pasta. ls it English?

1121
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:29,473
Italian.

1122
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,218
Even Italian is English.

1123
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:36,749
Nashta. Pasta.
- Its funny.

1124
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:41,288
I like it with the curd.
- Curd.

1125
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:44,355
You don‘t eat pasta with curd.
- No, aunty, we do.

1126
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,327
Why’?

1127
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,765
Digestion. Digestion.
- Yes, aunty, it‘s good.

1128
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:51,828
Aunty it‘s good for
the morning ablutions.

1129
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:53,631
You should have it too.

1130
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,140
Please, in future
I won‘t eat with you all.

1131
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:59,111
From now you can eat here.
I will eat in my room.

1132
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:01,580
Aunty, eat here.
- Aunty. Aunty, please.

1133
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:02,748

Don‘t worry. Eat. Eat.
- Aunty. - She felt bad.

1135
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,284
She didn‘t feel bad.
- Does anyone feel bad while eating?

1136
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,984
Come on. Let‘s eat.
- Eat.

1137
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,821
Eat. Sandwich too.

1138
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:18,725
Hey, I am going out for a round.
- Where?

1139
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,134
Just downstairs.
- Downstairs in the park’?

1140
01:14:21,524 --> 01:14:23,299
Are you coming’?
- I am studying.

1141
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:24,565
You should study too. Its exam tomorrow.

1142

Why are you going now?

01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:29,339
Yes, I am completely bored.
I will come too.

01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:31,673
Come. Come.
- Ask me too.

1145
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:33,040
Then come.
- Come on.

1146
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,173
You are too much.
- All of you three are going.

1147
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:37,047
Just for ten minutes.
We will return in ten minutes.

1148
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:38,915
But will you come in ten minutes’?

1149
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:41,554
Where? Where are they going?
- Where are they going?

1150
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:44,221
They said they are going
to get refreshed in open air.

1151
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,782
Fresh’? In the middle of the night.

1152
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,156
Thafs why I told him to have curd.

1153
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,093
Not that.
Open air. They are going to have fun.

1154
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:54,226
I know VT.
VT has gone below Floshnfs house.

1155
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,530
Why has Flam gone’?

1156
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,166
Rashmi had touched Ram‘s hand.

1157
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,834
He was feeling all tingly.
- Flam...

1158
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,544
Shall I go too’?
- Yes.

1159
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:07,137
These three have someone.
You don‘t have any. Why are you going?

1160
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:09,679
Actually I want to
meet the English madam.

1161
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:12,212
English is very difficult for me.
- Go on. Ask.

1162
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:14,016
I am finding English difficult.

1163
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,919
She will help you. Go.

1164
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,993
Listen. Your grapes are sour.

1165
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:22,255
Yours are sweet.
You are enjoying at your in-laws.

1166
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:23,592
Do you know whafs in-laws’?

1167
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:25,155
He will explain it to you.
Make sure you do.

01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:26,427
Explain.
- ln-laws.

1169
01:15:26,489 --> 01:15:27,593
Say.
- It means mom‘s home.

1170
01:15:27,657 --> 01:15:30,103
Smile first.
- It means mom‘s home.

1171
01:15:30,593 --> 01:15:33,039
Show me your dimples. So cute.

1172
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,708
See mine. Better than yours, right’?

1173
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,108
They are nice.
- Now tell me, whafs in-laws.

1174
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:38,907
Your mummy. Your mummy.

1175
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,148
How far will you go’?
Enough of roaming around.

1176
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:51,587
Come on, dear. Get down.
- Felling well. - It was fun.

1177
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:53,618
Hey.
- What happened’?

1178
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:54,786
We have come so far.

1179
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:57,625
How will we return?
We won‘t get any tractor.

1180
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:00,232
Forget all that. It is so nice here.

1181
01:16:00,323 --> 01:16:01,529
No, bro.

1182
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:03,934
I will feel nice once exams are over.

1183
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:06,638
Let me pee.

1184
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:08,772
Okay, I will pee too.

1185
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,219
Nothing can be more enjoyable than this.

1186
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:41,308
I just saw someone falling down.
- What happened’?

1187
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,576
I am telling the truth.
- VT, where are you going?

1188
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:45,873
Where are you going? Wait.

1189
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,208
Why are you running away?
- Where are you going?

1190
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:49,749
I saw something. Come here.

1191
01:16:51,507 --> 01:16:53,953
VT, what are you doing?
- Look, I told you.

1192
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:55,654
VT, where are you going?

1193
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:57,156
VT, where are you going?

1194
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:02,894
She is bleeding a lot.
- VT. 
t‘s a girl. Ram, it‘s a girl.

1195
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:05,928
Anil, come fast. Give her clothes.

1196
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,726
Ram, do one thing.

1197
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,669
Pick her up. Pick her up.

1198
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,639
Careful. Anil, go up and find a car.

1199
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:15,572
Go up and find a car. Look for a car.

1200
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,925
One minute. One minute. One minute.

1201
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:46,125
Doctor, look. Look at her.
- Doctor.

1202
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,498
Your patient is in a serious condition.

01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,187
She is much wounded.

No, we cannot admit her.

t‘s a police case.

1237
01:20:51,614 --> 01:20:52,786
Don‘t teach us law.

1238
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,191
Even the court has passed the law.

1239
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:55,819

Yes.

1245
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:11,529
The doctors have
admitted her to the ICU.

1246
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:15,639
And they are saying
that she might go into coma.

1247
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:18,177
Shit!
- What are you saying, bro’?

1248

We have donated the blood.

1250
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:26,618
The formalities are done.

1251
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,655
But until her parents come..

1252
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:31,155
..these people won‘t
get her admitted permanently.

1253
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,417
And bro, it‘s a big problem.

1254
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:37,320
I am confused, bro.

You need to go to the admin.

1259
01:22:57,573 --> 01:22:58,950
Now who is admin’?

Nobody will copy.

01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:46,433
Write something, kid. It will be useful.

1275
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,400
Acting innocent.

You could have at least spared this day.

01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:09,954
You could have come on time today.

1281
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:11,815
How much more will you stoop?

01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:14,390

1297

We found a girl lying

We need to reach the hospital first.

How can I come’? Father is not here.

1335

And sister has not

1336
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:54,747
I have to go home.

1337

Okay, come with me.

Floshni. - Floshni.

1343
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,081
Will she recover?
- Don‘t worry.

01:28:00,309 --> 01:28:01,982
I know you are a strong girl.

1345
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:05,453
Come. Who is it’? Come here.

Take their witness and file an FIR.

There will be no FIR.
We don‘t want to lodge an FIR.

1351
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:21,098
Wow, principal. You are very clear.

1352
01:28:22,231 --> 01:28:26,008
Our sir said that
educated people like you..

1353
01:28:26,201 --> 01:28:28,943
..act against injustice. Well.

1354
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:33,115
Tell us if you change your mind.

1355
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:34,252
The Police have got other work to do.

1356
01:28:34,343 --> 01:28:37,187
Sir, please, lodge a complaint.
- Sir, you see.

1357
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,821
Sir, how can you act so’?

1358
01:28:40,182 --> 01:28:42,389
Why’? How will this help?

1359
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:46,032
Will she recover?
Will she regain her honor’?

1360
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:49,599
She will be insulted her entire life.

1361
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:51,198
She will be tortured to death.

1362
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,068
The life Jyoti will lead is for later.

1363
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:57,275
But you are killing
her now by saying so.

1364
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:59,607
Why didn‘t you lodge a complaint?

1365
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:02,211
Scared of filing a complaint.

1366
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,184
You have disappointed me.

1367
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:10,582
But sir, those devils will go scoot free.

1368
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,215
Who will stop them’?

1369
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:14,258
I can‘t believe it that
you are doing this, sir.

1370
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:18,092
This is not fair.
- We will have to fight to win, sir.

1371
01:29:18,153 --> 01:29:21,862
Sir, we need to brave
to fight and win any fight.

1372
01:29:22,124 --> 01:29:23,262
Sir, we do have that.

1373
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,734
Sir, its you who always taught us to..

1374
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:27,602
..raise our voice against injustice.

1375
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:30,176
Sir, you used to say
that I believe, I can.

1376
01:29:30,232 --> 01:29:32,109
Where is your belief today, sir’?

1377
01:29:32,935 --> 01:29:36,473
Sir you are an ideal for us.
How can you do this, sir’?

1378
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:38,241
We didn‘t expect this of you, sir’?

1379
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:41,554
Yesterday the principal
who was standing here..

1380
01:29:42,311 --> 01:29:44,689
..had unbreakable principles.

1381
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:49,693
And today you see a father
who is being practicaL.

1382
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:55,525
..about his helplessness.
Go. Go to your homes.

1383
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,666
Sir, we won‘t go anywhere.

1384
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:02,139
We all will together
fight against injustice.

1385
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,544
Fight. Go ahead.

1386
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,438
You have to fight for
yourself and your own.

1387
01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:10,975
Your life has just started.

1388
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:17,423
With regards to injustice
then let it stay in the books.

1389
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:21,289
So that people can
turn pages to feel brave.

1390
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,859
If this is the matter,
then we will tear those pages.

1391
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,729
The one which says injustice, sir.

1392
01:30:27,222 --> 01:30:28,860
Don‘t get excited.

1393
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:32,668
First go and ask your family.

1394
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:37,370
I will lodge the FIR if
they allow you to bear witness.

1395
01:30:39,034 --> 01:30:40,672
Just go and ask once.

1396
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,508
Sir. - Sir.
- But sir.

1397
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:56,159
Nisha. What happened’?

1398
01:30:56,418 --> 01:31:00,696
Mom. Mom. - What happened’?
- Mom.

1399
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:07,571
Nisha baby. Tell me. What happened’?

1400
01:31:15,504 --> 01:31:16,847
What’?

1401
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:18,441
What’?

1402
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:21,448
Raped.
- Who’?

1403
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:26,390
Floshni, mom. Floshnfs sister, mom.

1404
01:31:26,615 --> 01:31:28,185
PrincipaFs daughter, Floshni.

1405
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,859
Mom, you have to fight.
You have to do something.

1406
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,900
Mom, please. Please mom. Please.

1407
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:35,730
You have to fight mom. Please.

1408
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,202
Come down, my child. Stop.

1409
01:31:40,362 --> 01:31:41,705
Please calm down. Calm down.

1410
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:44,437
Promise me you will do something.
Please mom.

1411
01:31:45,133 --> 01:31:46,203
Dear, there is a process of law.

1412
01:31:46,268 --> 01:31:47,440
I can‘t just go and fight the case.

1413
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:48,879
Tell me, what has happened’?

1414
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:54,615
Our principaFs daughter was raped.

1415
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:56,514
And she is in the hospital.

1416
01:31:57,145 --> 01:31:59,284
And we had saved her.

1417
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:02,987
What has happened to this society?

1418
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:06,230
It has gone to the ditches.

1419
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,692
I am ashamed of calling
myself an Indian.

1420
01:32:11,493 --> 01:32:13,473
I don‘t believe that so many great men..

1421
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,633
..have been born in this country.

1422
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,239
You have done a very good deed, son.

1423
01:32:20,669 --> 01:32:24,276
Your father gave up
his life for this country.

1424
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,986
You are carrying forward that heritage.

1425
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:30,148
I am proud of you.

1426
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:32,448
If I tell you that
I want to bear witness.

1427
01:32:33,682 --> 01:32:36,128
“against those rapists, then’?

1428
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:46,139
Son, law is nobody‘s well wisher.

1429
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:49,206
You are very young now.

1430
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:53,570
The rescuer is regarded as the criminal.

1431
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:56,445
And he has to spend his entire 
ife..

1432
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:58,211
“trying to prove his innocence.

1433
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:01,514
And the criminals go scoot free.

1434
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:07,251
Father, if you have taught
your son the same thing.

1435
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:12,054
..then maybe he would
have been with us today.

1436
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:17,161
Every parent wants
their son to be brave.

1437
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:22,572
But no one wants a brave
martyr to be born in their home.

1438
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:24,904
Allow him to fight, father.

1439
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:27,370
You are crazy. You have gone insane.

1440
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:30,445
No one in our family
has visited the court.

1441
01:33:30,505 --> 01:33:31,677
He wants to go to court.

1442
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:34,152
Father, you don‘t understand.
Listen to me.

1443
01:33:34,443 --> 01:33:36,889
Father, that girl is in coma.
She needs my help.

1444
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:40,051
You will help her.
Are all other helpers dead’?

1445
01:33:40,582 --> 01:33:42,425
I had sent you to school to study.

1446
01:33:42,918 --> 01:33:45,524
You will spend your entire
life bearing witness at court.

1447
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:48,397
The case will never end.
Look at this witness.

1448
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,660
Okay, father. You are right.

1449
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:54,263
I should wait for that rapist
to rape my mother and sister.

1450
01:33:59,234 --> 01:34:02,010
No matter where you go, father.
I will bear witness.

1451
01:34:02,437 --> 01:34:04,713
And you will also listen to me.

1452
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:06,942
You will listen too.

1453
01:34:07,275 --> 01:34:10,119
Sir, your daughtefs
condition is not improving.

1454
01:34:10,178 --> 01:34:11,987
He condition is very critical.

1455
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,321
We are trying our best. - Thank you.

1456
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:20,190
Bhanu. - Sir.
Sir. I cou
dn‘t see her, sir.

1457
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:23,726
Sir, did you see your daughter?

1458
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:28,637
Sir, she has stitches here.
Her neck bone is broken.

1459
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,871
Her hand is plastered, sir.

1460
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,339
I cou
dn‘t see below her waist, sir.

1461
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:41,649
Sir, I feel like cutting
them with an axe.

1462
01:34:42,644 --> 01:34:45,648
I can‘t see it. I can‘t see it.

1463
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:52,192
The flower like girl.
Look at her, sir. I can‘t see it.

1464
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,932
How can they do this to her’?

1465
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,366
My flower like girl. Sir.

1466
01:34:59,461 --> 01:35:02,704
Sir, bring back our flower like girl.

1467
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:05,936
Bring back our flower like girl.

1468
01:35:07,569 --> 01:35:09,014
Actually the girl who was raped..

1469
01:35:09,104 --> 01:35:10,606
..is the sister of my daughtefs friend.

1470
01:35:11,306 --> 01:35:12,842
She is like family to me.

1471
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:15,620
Thafs why I am both professionally.

1472
01:35:15,977 --> 01:35:17,650
..and personally involved in this case.

1473
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:19,719
I won‘t leave any stone unturned..

1474
01:35:21,249 --> 01:35:24,093
..to ensure justice to that child.

1475
01:35:24,786 --> 01:35:26,629
I am pleased to hear your thoughts.

1476
01:35:27,989 --> 01:35:31,903
But remember that we will get justice.

1477
01:35:32,661 --> 01:35:35,665
..on
y if we don‘t
lose courage or get bribed.

1478
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,508
This child could have
been my daughter too.

1479
01:35:40,969 --> 01:35:42,505
Trust me.

1480
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,581
Exactly.

1481
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:47,552
Mr. principal, I understand your pain.

1482
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:50,446
These are hard times for you.

1483
01:35:51,713 --> 01:35:53,784
You have to be patient.

1484
01:35:56,184 --> 01:36:01,566
We all are there to ensure

1485
01:36:03,324 --> 01:36:05,930
These kids are ready
to bear witness at court.

1486
01:36:06,695 --> 01:36:10,802
Sir, you consider this as our fees.

1487
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:13,872
You are listening to these kids.
You are...

1488
01:36:14,035 --> 01:36:19,212
Listen to me.
You will have to lodge an FIR.

1489
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:23,444
Papa, you cannot be weak. Papa.

1490
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:27,988
Please lodge an FIR against them.
Don‘t support them.

1491
01:36:28,082 --> 01:36:29,823
They have hurt my elder sister...

1492
01:36:32,921 --> 01:36:33,899
Okay.

1493
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:37,569
Lodge the FIR.

1494
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:46,811
Madam prosecutor,
please proceed with the case.

1495
01:36:56,311 --> 01:37:02,990
Milord, at 7:00 pm on 19th April,
victim left her home..

1496
01:37:03,785 --> 01:37:06,026
..to attend her friends birthday party.

1497
01:37:07,756 --> 01:37:10,032
When she is returning
at 11:00 pm hours at night.

1498
01:37:10,592 --> 01:37:15,598
..she is being kidnapped
in a big SUV on her way.

1499
01:37:16,064 --> 01:37:18,943
And they gang raped
her in the moving vehicle.

1500
01:37:19,301 --> 01:37:22,111
Milord, after checking
the victim‘s medical report..

1501
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:25,447
..then rape is still a very small word.

1502
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:29,520
Her kidney was outside her body.

1503
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:32,549
And she is still in coma.

1504
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:36,260
The proof and medical
reports co

ected..

1505
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,559
“during the investigation
of SP Tej Veer Singh..

1506
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:42,130
..has been handed over to you, milord.

1507
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:45,727
I request you to give me permission..

1508
01:37:45,827 --> 01:37:48,398
..to ask SP Tej Veer
Singh a few questions.

1509
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,233
Permission granted.

1510
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:57,516
SP Tej Veer Singh.

1511
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:02,483
Please tell the court what
you got during the investigation?

1512
01:38:03,912 --> 01:38:05,949
Your honor, these are the boys..

1513
01:38:06,514 --> 01:38:08,619
..who took the victim
to hospital that day.

1514
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:14,522
And we investigated that
area as per their witness.

1515
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,964
I took these kids to the act of crime..

1516
01:38:18,693 --> 01:38:20,172
..where they had found this girl.

1517
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,538
They showed us the
place where the girl“

1518
01:38:23,598 --> 01:38:26,044
..was thrown from the SUV vehicle.

1519
01:38:27,602 --> 01:38:32,415
After investigating the area,
we found drops of b
ood..

1520
01:38:33,441 --> 01:38:35,614
..which matched the gir
‘s blood sample.

1521
01:38:39,381 --> 01:38:42,828
And after asking around we fund that..

1522
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:45,830
..a SUV vehicle had
broken down at Jarcha road.

1523
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:48,232
And it was standing
there the entire night.

1524
01:38:58,499 --> 01:39:01,070
When we reached there,
the car was not there.

1525
01:39:01,736 --> 01:39:04,239
But we found some
broken headlight pieces.

1526
01:39:04,672 --> 01:39:09,587
And a broken bottle which
confirmed my suspicions.

1527
01:39:21,189 --> 01:39:23,066
Then we started working
with the entire team.

1528
01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:27,699
And we found the SUV from the ditch..

1529
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:30,201
..which they had
sunk after the incident.

1530
01:39:31,366 --> 01:39:32,811
It was not hard to
find the car‘s owner..

1531
01:39:32,867 --> 01:39:34,278
..with the help of the number plate.

1532
01:39:34,936 --> 01:39:38,577
After information retrieved
from locals and informants.

1533
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:41,887
..our team arrested these
three from a farm house.

1534
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:46,148
By the way, they run very fast.

1535
01:40:14,943 --> 01:40:17,423

‘m sure, my dear friend
would like to question now.

1536
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,089
Your report is very impressive.

1537
01:40:26,954 --> 01:40:29,366
You have solved
the case in a single hearing.

1538
01:40:30,759 --> 01:40:34,002
Milord, the vehicle
he is talking about..

1539
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,834
..the vehicle was
stolen 15 days ago.

1540
01:40:41,602 --> 01:40:44,014
This is the copy of the F.
.R logged.

She is crying since morning.

I will talk to her.

01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:30,950
I will talk to her.

1562
01:42:56,304 --> 01:42:58,045
Floshni.

1563
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,350
Look Floshni,
Everything will be alright.

1566
01:43:25,266 --> 01:43:26,973
Don‘t cry.

1567
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,942
Don‘t cry.

1568
01:43:29,971 --> 01:43:31,951
Sister.
- Nothing will happen.

1569
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:35,051
She will be alright, trust me.

1570
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:39,024
Enough. enough.

1571
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,925
Hello, I don‘t want a protest.

1572
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,300
SP, keep the media away from all this.

1573
01:43:49,991 --> 01:43:52,096
And get rid of this issue at the earliest.

1574
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,103
Do you understand’?

1575
01:43:54,195 --> 01:43:57,369
Will you do something
or just be like this’?

1576
01:43:57,432 --> 01:43:58,968
Sir, we are working on that.

1577
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:04,843

t‘s time for hearing, grandpa.
Let‘s go.

1578
01:44:06,307 --> 01:44:09,754
Dear, I will not be able to see all this’?

1579
01:44:09,877 --> 01:44:10,252
Why’?

1580
01:44:10,945 --> 01:44:13,084
Let me be here’?

1581
01:44:13,481 --> 01:44:15,154
You go, you manage this.

1582
01:44:17,085 --> 01:44:18,029
Are you sure’?

1583
01:44:18,119 --> 01:44:20,065
I will sit under a tree here.

1584
01:44:21,389 --> 01:44:22,424
Take care.

1585
01:44:38,806 --> 01:44:40,877
You take care of the problem out.

1586
01:44:40,942 --> 01:44:42,649
I will manage here.

1587
01:44:42,744 --> 01:44:44,690
Boys will be free today.

1588
01:44:52,253 --> 01:44:53,288
Please sit down.

1589
01:44:54,689 --> 01:44:56,362
Let the hearing begin.

1590
01:44:56,557 --> 01:44:59,970
Milord, the deep study in these 3 days.

1591
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:02,329
Has made this
case as clear as water.

1592
01:45:03,831 --> 01:45:06,937
But, my respected colleague.

1593
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:10,446
Wants to add colors to it.

1594
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:14,343
The night the incident took place.

1595
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:16,846
They were not here that night.

1596
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,518
Objection my lord.

1597
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,383
Objection overruled.

1598
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:26,797
Milord, the night‘s incident
for which these innocents..

1599
01:45:26,854 --> 01:45:28,663
..are being accused of rape.

1600
01:45:28,889 --> 01:45:30,562
That night they were in Mumbai.

1601
01:45:31,959 --> 01:45:35,771
Milord, here is their hotel bills.

1602
01:45:35,863 --> 01:45:37,467
Their credit card bills.

1603
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:38,737
Their flight tickets.

1604
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:43,373
Here is the passes

1605
01:45:43,971 --> 01:45:45,473
Milord, here is..

1606
01:45:47,241 --> 01:45:52,418
..their CCTV footage of
ATMs in different places of Mumbai.

1607
01:45:55,483 --> 01:45:57,463
I think these evidence
are enough Ms. Jayshree.

1608
01:45:57,551 --> 01:45:58,689
Or do you want more’?

1609
01:45:58,753 --> 01:46:02,462
My lord, all these evidences are,
false and forged.

1610
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:05,066
I think your degree is forged too.

1611
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,732
What’?

1612
01:46:06,794 --> 01:46:09,900
You are talking to a gold medalist
from a reputed law college.

1613
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:11,876
Of course, I have a degree.

1614
01:46:12,266 --> 01:46:15,145
I would appreciate.
- You have a degree?

1615
01:46:15,603 --> 01:46:16,411
Obviously.

1616
01:46:16,504 --> 01:46:19,508
So, a piece of paper that
endorses that you have studied law.

1617
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:21,676
That you are not a forged lawyer.

1618
01:46:22,109 --> 01:46:26,387
Same as that, my papers
are evidences not forged.

1619
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:28,685
So, Milord, my request is.

1620
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:31,328
Please those 3 guys
be called on witness box.

1621
01:46:31,519 --> 01:46:32,930
Who saved victim‘s life.

1622
01:46:33,654 --> 01:46:34,792
Permission granted.

1623
01:46:42,496 --> 01:46:43,839
Go soon, go.

1624
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:51,609
Tell your name to the court.

1625
01:46:51,872 --> 01:46:54,250
Flam Raghavendra Pratap Chowdhary.

1626
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:57,685
Anil Girish Sharma.

1627
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:00,025
VT.
- Tell your full name.

1628
01:47:01,615 --> 01:47:02,787
Vikram Tyagi.

1629
01:47:02,883 --> 01:47:04,362
Tell your villages‘ names.

1630
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:07,262
Armola.

1631
01:47:08,889 --> 01:47:10,334
Lalit Nagar.

1632
01:47:10,557 --> 01:47:11,900
Rampur.

1633
01:47:13,127 --> 01:47:14,800
Milord, as far as I know.

1634
01:47:15,529 --> 01:47:20,239
These 3 villages are approximately
25 or 3O km away from the incident site.

1635
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:25,080
So, you guys, between
1 and 1.30 in the night.

1636
01:47:25,172 --> 01:47:28,619
You had come to save
the victim 30kms from your village?

1637
01:47:29,477 --> 01:47:32,890
No, we stay in the city
preparing for the exams.

1638
01:47:35,216 --> 01:47:37,492
But, what were you doing
so late in the night there’?

1639
01:47:37,985 --> 01:47:39,589
Exam preparation on road’?

1640
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,863
Sir, we had been for a walk.

1641
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:45,327
You said you had come for exams,
you say you had been out for walk.

1642
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,639
Do you wan to say something?

1643
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:49,670
Let me tell you.

1644
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:51,505

‘m asking them, Milord.

1645
01:47:52,032 --> 01:47:53,272
Tell me.

1646
01:47:54,735 --> 01:47:58,205
Sir, we were doing
combined study at Nisha‘s house.

1647
01:47:59,273 --> 01:48:00,616
Who is Nisha’?

1648
01:48:00,908 --> 01:48:02,148
Nisha is ma‘am‘s.
- Milord.

1649
01:48:03,977 --> 01:48:05,547
Nisha is my daughter.

1650
01:48:06,247 --> 01:48:08,193
These 3 kids stayed at my house.

1651
01:48:08,248 --> 01:48:10,626
Were studying together
with my daughter Nisha.

1652
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:13,155
Group study, not a crime.

1653
01:48:13,254 --> 01:48:16,758
But, gang rape is a heinous crime.

1654
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:20,796
Milord, in the last 6 months,
these guys.

1655
01:48:21,362 --> 01:48:23,467
..have been punished
thrice by the principal.

1656
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:27,175
ls that the reason,
to take a revenge against principaL.

1657
01:48:27,401 --> 01:48:29,677
..they raped his daughter and..

1658
01:48:29,937 --> 01:48:31,678
..together..
- Objection, Milord.

1659
01:48:31,939 --> 01:48:33,282
Objection over ruled.

1660
01:48:33,474 --> 01:48:37,115
Milord, the evidences that
I have produced in the court.

1661
01:48:37,612 --> 01:48:40,058
Those all are collected
by SP Tejaveer Singh.

1662
01:48:40,147 --> 01:48:43,424
These evidence are fabricated, my lord.

1663
01:48:43,817 --> 01:48:45,660
This is a trick by the defense.

1664
01:48:45,753 --> 01:48:47,494
To prove the guilty, the innocents.

1665
01:48:47,588 --> 01:48:49,932
You don‘t have anything left to say.

1666
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:53,630
Milord, I request the honorable court.

1667
01:48:54,395 --> 01:48:56,534
For the next 8 days,
these 3 should be..

1668
01:48:56,764 --> 01:49:00,405
..sent to police remand and restart.
- Sir.

1669
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:05,283
Before you pass your judgment,
I want to say something to you.

1670
01:49:05,472 --> 01:49:08,578
Whatever you want to say,
come and say in the witness box.

1671
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:10,750
One minute.

1672
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:22,493
What are you looking at’?

1673
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:27,133

‘m looking that, by
coming in this 3 by 3 box..

1674
01:49:27,628 --> 01:49:29,699
..how does a man‘s
thinking change?

1675
01:49:30,164 --> 01:49:32,576
He thinks something and

1676
01:49:33,367 --> 01:49:35,244
You never when it changes.

1677
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,811
Am I right SP sir’?

1678
01:49:37,872 --> 01:49:39,442
Tell us what did you want to say.

1679
01:49:39,874 --> 01:49:42,218
Don‘t joke here.
- 
‘m not joking.

1680
01:49:42,944 --> 01:49:46,016
When your son will stand in
my son‘s place, you will know that.

1681
01:49:47,148 --> 01:49:49,560
Judge sir, 
..

1682
01:49:50,784 --> 01:49:52,957
I told them.

1683
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:55,324
Not to interfere in anyone‘s matter.

1684
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:57,628
You get trapped.

1685
01:49:58,025 --> 01:49:59,868
They are trapped now.

1686
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:02,964
We common people.

1687
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:07,103
Compromise our lives,
never want a change.

1688
01:50:08,402 --> 01:50:10,678
But, these kids
did not understand that.

1689
01:50:11,572 --> 01:50:14,644
They said, they are youth.

1690
01:50:15,576 --> 01:50:17,988
We will take risk,
we will bring change.

1691
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:20,982
But, they don‘t know.

1692
01:50:21,548 --> 01:50:26,327
That, the place they
want to bring change in..

1693
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:27,899
..is 100 years old.

1694
01:50:29,557 --> 01:50:32,060
Has this place changed ever’?

1695
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,468
No.

1696
01:50:35,329 --> 01:50:38,173
The language spoken
here is 100 years old too.

1697
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,873
Has there been a change
in that language either?

1698
01:50:40,968 --> 01:50:41,969
No.

1699
01:50:42,169 --> 01:50:45,548
The thought behind decisions
taken here are 100 years old too.

1700
01:50:45,906 --> 01:50:48,011
Has there been any change in that’?
Bloody no.

1701
01:50:48,209 --> 01:50:50,382
You better respect the court.

1702
01:50:51,212 --> 01:50:54,455

‘m sorry sir,

‘m not able to see the kids‘ state.

1703
01:50:55,516 --> 01:50:58,827
I have been listen to them say change“
change all these days.

1704
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:00,522
They were playing
freedom, freedom.

1705
01:51:01,956 --> 01:51:03,526
I lost myself a little.

1706
01:51:04,191 --> 01:51:05,829
They brought change.

1707
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,663
They brought change in our lives.

1708
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:11,639
We have been living seeing them.

1709
01:51:12,066 --> 01:51:14,546
Now we are dying slowly.

1710
01:51:15,769 --> 01:51:17,771

‘m proud of the parents.

1711
01:51:17,871 --> 01:51:20,579
..who can turn a truth into lie.

1712
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:25,615

‘m ashamed of myself.

1713
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,388
That I don‘t have anything
to prove the truth, truth.

1714
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:31,087
So, that I can save him.

1715
01:51:33,287 --> 01:51:35,233
Judge sir, you are right.

1716
01:51:35,323 --> 01:51:37,929
They should be punished.

1717
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:41,962
Or any common man
will come here for justice.

1718
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:45,609
Justice is for those who lie.

1719
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,673

t‘s not for common men.

1720
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:51,077
Hang them to death.

1721
01:51:53,974 --> 01:51:56,079
The speech was quite motivational.

1722
01:51:57,945 --> 01:52:01,586
But, court needs evidence not emotion.

1723
01:52:02,749 --> 01:52:04,490
Jayshree, do you want to say something?

1724
01:52:07,254 --> 01:52:08,392
No Milord.

1725
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:12,799
The court orders, these 3 boys..

1726
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:16,198
..to be sent to police custody for 8 days.

1727
01:52:16,263 --> 01:52:19,210
Thank you, Milord.
- Next hearing will be after 8 days.

1728
01:52:19,533 --> 01:52:20,978
The court is adjourned.

1729
01:52:21,535 --> 01:52:24,072
Sir, we did not anything,
we did not do anything sir.

1730
01:52:24,137 --> 01:52:25,343
Sir please sir.
- What is happening?

1731
01:52:30,644 --> 01:52:31,987
Sir“ sir.

1732
01:52:50,498 --> 01:52:52,102
Madam, my question.

1733
01:52:52,199 --> 01:52:55,043
The guys whom you were proving
innocent has been sent on remand today’?

1734
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:17,860
BaPPu~

1735
01:54:23,290 --> 01:54:25,463

t‘s networking.

1736
01:54:48,582 --> 01:54:52,962
We take vows on
15 August and 26 January that..

1737
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:56,593
..that we will free our India
from injustice and corruption.

1738
01:54:57,191 --> 01:54:59,728
We determine
that and return home.

1739
01:55:00,694 --> 01:55:03,436
We then keep the determination
under our pillow and sleep on it.

1740
01:55:03,497 --> 01:55:06,000
Next day, next morning,
we go to work.

1741
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:08,444
But our determination
remains there, under the pillow.

1742
01:55:08,769 --> 01:55:12,182
It keeps waiting,
that when next 26 January..

1743
01:55:12,273 --> 01:55:13,581
..or 15 August will arrive.

1744
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,587
But today is neither
15 August nor 26 January.

1745
01:55:16,777 --> 01:55:19,257
Today 
et‘s determine something.

1746
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:23,053
Till we get justice to the vulnerable.

1747
01:55:23,116 --> 01:55:25,153
We will not stop the protest.

1748
01:55:25,252 --> 01:55:28,358
"If you look at my mother."

1749
01:55:28,422 --> 01:55:31,528
"I swear, <i>
‘

</i> break your head."

1750
01:55:31,591 --> 01:55:34,765
"If you see my sister."

1751
01:55:34,828 --> 01:55:37,672
"I swear, <i>
‘

</i> break your face."

1752
01:55:38,065 --> 01:55:41,046
"Buddy, until when can we keep quiet?"

1753
01:55:41,134 --> 01:55:44,445
"Don‘t we have guts?"

1754
01:55:47,641 --> 01:55:50,850
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1755
01:55:50,911 --> 01:55:53,983
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1756
01:55:54,081 --> 01:55:57,187
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1757
01:55:57,284 --> 01:56:00,390
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1758
01:56:06,259 --> 01:56:09,035
"Rapist."

1759
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:12,411
"You are the disease."

1760
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:18,912
"It is our responsibility to finish you."

1761
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:24,888
"These women are not helpless."

1762
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:32,021
"God has created this world.
Everything belongs to Him."

1763
01:56:32,285 --> 01:56:35,323
"Are we blind or deaf?"

1764
01:56:35,422 --> 01:56:38,665
"Don‘t we have guts?"

1765
01:56:42,028 --> 01:56:45,168
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1766
01:56:45,265 --> 01:56:48,712
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1767
01:57:01,181 --> 01:57:04,321
"
‘ve been brought up in pain.
I am very shocked."

1768
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:07,422
"
‘m like a bud in the garden.
I have become very sad."

1769
01:57:07,588 --> 01:57:10,364
"
‘m a golden bird,
who is scared to fly."

1770
01:57:10,457 --> 01:57:13,631
"I am scared to get humiliated
in the dark lanes."

1771
01:57:13,727 --> 01:57:17,004
"Why am I so scared?"

1772
01:57:17,264 --> 01:57:20,177
"You call me a fairy."

1773
01:57:20,233 --> 01:57:23,237
"You surround me when alone
and snatch my scarf."

1774
01:57:23,303 --> 01:57:26,716
"You stop us in the alley.
You throw acid."

1775
01:57:26,807 --> 01:57:29,788
"You burn the soul
and hang it on the tree."

1776
01:57:29,876 --> 01:57:33,050
"You strip us with your dirty talks."

1777
01:57:33,113 --> 01:57:36,219
"I am Fladha, I am Sita, I am Lakshmi."

1778
01:57:36,283 --> 01:57:39,127
"
‘m Durga, I am Chandi, I am Kaali."

1779
01:57:46,026 --> 01:57:49,064
"If you look at my mother."

1780
01:57:49,162 --> 01:57:52,336
"I swear, <i>
‘

</i> break your head."

1781
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:55,573
"If you see my sister."

1782
01:57:55,635 --> 01:57:58,809
"I swear, <i>
‘

</i> break your face."

1783
01:57:58,872 --> 01:58:01,785
"Buddy, until when can we keep quiet?"

1784
01:58:01,875 --> 01:58:05,152
"Don‘t we have guts?"

1785
01:58:09,917 --> 01:58:13,160
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1786
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:16,258
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1787
01:58:16,357 --> 01:58:19,531
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1788
01:58:19,626 --> 01:58:22,698
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1789
01:58:22,763 --> 01:58:25,937
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1790
01:58:25,999 --> 01:58:29,242
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1791
01:58:29,336 --> 01:58:32,442
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1792
01:58:32,506 --> 01:58:35,544
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1793
01:58:42,249 --> 01:58:45,628
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1794
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:49,426
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1795
01:58:49,489 --> 01:58:52,629
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1796
01:58:52,726 --> 01:58:55,832
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1797
01:58:55,929 --> 01:58:59,103
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1798
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:02,612
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1799
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:23,430
Dad, eat something.

1800
01:59:23,757 --> 01:59:25,532
I don‘t want to eat.

1801
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:38,212
What happened’?
- Grandpa.

1802
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:40,882
Dad is not eating food.

1803
01:59:48,648 --> 01:59:49,786
Dad.

1804
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,852
Why are you not eating food’?

1805
01:59:53,287 --> 01:59:54,664

‘m not feeling hungry.

1806
01:59:57,457 --> 01:59:58,561
Look.

1807
02:00:00,327 --> 02:00:04,173
When I lost my only son in Kargil.

1808
02:00:05,432 --> 02:00:07,309
I was 55 then.

1809
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:10,579
It was as if my world was shattered.

1810
02:00:12,572 --> 02:00:15,951
But, I realized my responsibilities.

1811
02:00:17,477 --> 02:00:19,252
The pain faded.

1812
02:00:23,150 --> 02:00:27,656
See, 
‘m alive even
after losing my only son.

1813
02:00:29,556 --> 02:00:31,194
You have your responsibilities too.

1814
02:00:32,292 --> 02:00:35,933
If you lose your hope,
who will look after these kids’?

1815
02:00:47,674 --> 02:00:48,652
Sir.

1816
02:00:49,609 --> 02:00:51,680
Remove them
from here right now. - Okay.

1817
02:00:51,878 --> 02:00:54,154
Change their appearance
and make them meet their families.

1818
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:56,959
Tomorrow is the hearing,
if something happens to them’?

1819
02:00:58,318 --> 02:00:59,956
You are a senior officer.

1820
02:01:00,386 --> 02:01:01,763
Understand your responsibility.

1821
02:01:02,622 --> 02:01:03,532
Yes, sir.

1822
02:01:09,829 --> 02:01:11,968
Santhosh, bring the 3 guys.

1823
02:01:22,976 --> 02:01:26,082
Anil.
- Gather yourself.

1824
02:01:33,386 --> 02:01:36,060
Come to me.

1825
02:01:41,194 --> 02:01:44,198
Had not I given them
the idea of combine study.

1826
02:01:45,165 --> 02:01:47,771
They would not
have been in such a state. I am so sorry.

1827
02:01:48,334 --> 02:01:49,711

‘m so sorry.

1828
02:01:51,771 --> 02:01:53,079
Sir, we all landed safely.

1829
02:01:53,173 --> 02:01:54,914
Your luggage has come safe.

1830
02:01:55,275 --> 02:01:56,413
Sir, what is the command further’?

1831
02:01:56,643 --> 02:01:58,589
The luggage should reach on time.

1832
02:01:58,678 --> 02:02:00,954
Sir, you don‘t worry,
everything is under control.

1833
02:02:01,147 --> 02:02:02,455
I will manage sir.

1834
02:02:04,117 --> 02:02:06,290
This task should happen
smooth, do you understand’?

1835
02:02:06,353 --> 02:02:08,355
Yes, sir. You don‘t worry.

1836
02:02:08,755 --> 02:02:09,961
0k, sir.
- Okay.

1837
02:02:16,963 --> 02:02:19,910
Preeti Singh, you meet
me in the court after an hour.

1838
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:12,423
Hello, the task is done sir.

1839
02:03:25,198 --> 02:03:27,075
Let the hearing begin.

1840
02:03:27,167 --> 02:03:29,943
Milord, I request, the
important witness of this case..

1841
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:32,841
“SP Tejaveer Singh
to come to the witness box.

1842
02:03:33,173 --> 02:03:34,584
Permission granted.

1843
02:03:41,715 --> 02:03:43,319
Sir, tell us.

1844
02:03:44,251 --> 02:03:46,754
What did you get in
8 days judicial custody.

1845
02:03:47,354 --> 02:03:48,332
Judge sir.

1846
02:03:50,123 --> 02:03:53,434
Whatever was said
in the last hearing was wrong.

1847
02:03:59,032 --> 02:04:01,706
The men who were
accused at the first.

1848
02:04:03,169 --> 02:04:04,147
They are the real criminals.

1849
02:04:10,443 --> 02:04:11,854
These kids are innocent.

1850
02:04:15,581 --> 02:04:18,118
About the evidences
by Mr. Promod Mittal.

1851
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,862
I investigated them,
they are all forged.

1852
02:04:27,627 --> 02:04:28,970
This is the report.

1853
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:39,576
What are you saying?
You are falsifying yourself.

1854
02:04:40,573 --> 02:04:41,984
You talk too much.

1855
02:04:43,409 --> 02:04:46,947
Judge sir, people often
buy justice with money.

1856
02:04:48,281 --> 02:04:49,817
I did the same.

1857
02:04:51,484 --> 02:04:53,088
I too bought justice.

1858
02:04:54,287 --> 02:04:55,664
Out of Dewan sir‘s money.

1859
02:04:57,290 --> 02:05:02,740
After the first hearing, I found
law defeated in front of a rich dad.

1860
02:05:03,730 --> 02:05:05,869
I saw a dad‘s love there.

1861
02:05:06,766 --> 02:05:09,804
He wanted to save
his criminal kids somehow.

1862
02:05:11,471 --> 02:05:12,916
I helped him.

1863
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:16,079
The same day,
with the special force..

1864
02:05:16,142 --> 02:05:17,985
..sent his children to Thailand.

1865
02:05:18,845 --> 02:05:20,586
Where they were secured.

1866
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:23,827
I know, what I did is against law.

1867
02:05:25,385 --> 02:05:29,060
Further that I want to tell,
I cannot tell in this uniform.

1868
02:05:30,890 --> 02:05:34,303
So, here is my resignation.

1869
02:05:38,832 --> 02:05:42,302
Sir, he is making fun of law.

1870
02:05:42,402 --> 02:05:44,575
Society is made fun of.

1871
02:05:45,438 --> 02:05:48,146
Where a rapist neither
considers a 3 year old kid.

1872
02:05:48,374 --> 02:05:49,819
Nor a 8O year old lady.

1873
02:05:50,843 --> 02:05:52,481
What is this’?

1874
02:05:53,747 --> 02:05:55,351
Disease.

1875
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:57,084
What is the cure for this disease?

1876
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:00,496
Nothing.

1877
02:06:06,826 --> 02:06:08,533
I have found a cure.

1878
02:06:09,496 --> 02:06:12,067
Preethvi Sing, bring them inside.
- Yes, sir.

1879
02:07:00,613 --> 02:07:03,685
Dewan sir, I promised you..

1880
02:07:04,484 --> 02:07:08,227
I will not let your children die.
I have kept my promise.

1881
02:07:10,056 --> 02:07:12,127
I had taken 4 crores from you.

1882
02:07:13,059 --> 02:07:17,974
Medical bill and the tickets to
Thailand has coasted 3 crore and 75 lakhs.

1883
02:07:21,067 --> 02:07:25,174
In a big hospital of Thailand,
their gender change has been done.

1884
02:07:31,677 --> 02:07:34,419
In 18 months,
they will turn into girls.

1885
02:07:38,385 --> 02:07:40,023
The rest 25 lakhs.

1886
02:07:40,586 --> 02:07:41,929
You will get it.

1887
02:07:44,924 --> 02:07:47,495
Judge sir, I could have shot them,
then what would have happened’?

1888
02:07:48,294 --> 02:07:49,500
They would have died then’?

1889
02:07:52,198 --> 02:07:54,508
I want to see them suffer.

1890
02:07:56,402 --> 02:07:58,109
Of the girl who is in coma now.

1891
02:07:59,606 --> 02:08:01,210
Of her helpless dad.

1892
02:08:01,708 --> 02:08:04,154
Those 5 kids, asking for justice.

1893
02:08:07,013 --> 02:08:09,721
The 1000s of people supporting them.

1894
02:08:16,423 --> 02:08:20,667
After hearing this,
you can punish me in anyway.

1895
02:08:24,664 --> 02:08:27,611
I did what I felt is right.

1896
02:08:28,601 --> 02:08:33,573
For the first time
I sold myself to buy justice.

1897
02:08:38,778 --> 02:08:41,122
It is clear with SP sir‘s evidence..

1898
02:08:43,049 --> 02:08:47,020
..these 3 kids, Flam Pratap Singh.

1899
02:08:47,887 --> 02:08:49,764
Vikram Tyagi and Anil Sharma.

1900
02:08:51,357 --> 02:08:53,303
Are innocents.

1901
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:56,333
The court sets them free.

1902
02:09:09,242 --> 02:09:10,721
Congratulations.

1903
02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:14,148
Order.. order.

1904
02:09:19,719 --> 02:09:22,063
The disease SP sir has spoken about.

1905
02:09:23,556 --> 02:09:26,093
That agitates me too.

1906
02:09:27,327 --> 02:09:31,366
This disease should be cured.

1907
02:09:32,898 --> 02:09:35,435
Because the whole country
is asking for a cure.

1908
02:09:36,435 --> 02:09:39,609
And the punishment
SP sir has given them..

1909
02:09:41,408 --> 02:09:43,786
I too agree with it.

1910
02:09:44,177 --> 02:09:50,150
In return, if the law of the nation,
wants to punish me.

1911
02:09:51,951 --> 02:09:53,294
I accept it.

1912
02:10:03,963 --> 02:10:05,567
This fight has been won.

1913
02:10:06,533 --> 02:10:08,035
But the war is left.

1914
02:10:09,135 --> 02:10:12,981
We should fight this war for our mothers,
sisters and daughters.

1915
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:17,682
We will succeed,
when 
ndia‘s every daughter“

1916
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:22,689
..in every corner of India,
every time, would feel secured.

1917
02:10:23,516 --> 02:10:28,124
The victory is not difficult,
we just should change our thoughts.

1918
02:10:58,918 --> 02:11:01,956
"If you look at my mother."

1919
02:11:02,055 --> 02:11:05,195
"I swear, <i>
‘

</i> break your head."

1920
02:11:05,257 --> 02:11:08,431
"If you see my sister."

1921
02:11:08,494 --> 02:11:11,634
"I swear, <i>
‘

</i> break your face."

1922
02:11:11,731 --> 02:11:14,678
"Buddy, until when can we keep quiet?"

1923
02:11:14,734 --> 02:11:17,271
"Don‘t we have guts?"

1924
02:11:21,341 --> 02:11:24,447
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1925
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:27,650
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1926
02:11:27,714 --> 02:11:30,888
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1927
02:11:30,983 --> 02:11:34,328
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1928
02:11:39,959 --> 02:11:42,963
"Rapist."

1929
02:11:43,162 --> 02:11:46,234
"You are the disease."

1930
02:11:46,299 --> 02:11:52,580
"It is our responsibility to finish you."

1931
02:11:52,638 --> 02:11:58,748
"These women are not helpless."

1932
02:11:59,178 --> 02:12:05,754
"God has created this world.
Everything belongs to Him."

1933
02:12:05,952 --> 02:12:08,956
"Are we blind or deaf?"

1934
02:12:09,189 --> 02:12:12,466
"Don‘t we have guts?"

1935
02:12:15,694 --> 02:12:18,903
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1936
02:12:18,965 --> 02:12:22,037
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1937
02:12:22,101 --> 02:12:25,310
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1938
02:12:25,405 --> 02:12:28,511
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1939
02:12:28,608 --> 02:12:31,680
"Mother, I salute thee!"

1940
02:12:31,744 --> 02:12:34,782
"Mother, I salute thee!"
