1
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,314
'Foreign language.'

2
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,949
'Foreign language.'

3
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,443
'Foreign language.'

4
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:12,195
I have reached.

5
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:14,091
- Sample?
- It's safe.

6
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:15,623
Where should I come?

7
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,585
You don't have to come Suraj,
you have to go.

8
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:13,390
"Looking for a reason,
without any reason"

9
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:19,943
"I lost myself in this world,
looking for the world"

10
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:26,316
"Looking for an incident"

11
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:32,546
"Look where I have reached,
searching"

12
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:39,272
"Everywhere, every lane,
I couldn't find my destination"

13
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:44,913
"Just holding my breath"

14
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:51,314
"Confronted by the desert"

15
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:57,632
"I am a gypsy, what should I do?"

16
00:05:57,835 --> 00:06:04,116
"Confronted by the desert"

17
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:11,459
"I am a gypsy, what should I do?"

18
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,319
Mister, you cannot park here.
Please make a move.

19
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:29,519
Sir, I am just leaving now.

20
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:30,997
One minute! Yes, yes!

21
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:36,200
Cannot, cannot... You keep
your money... I want you move now...

22
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:39,311
Look, officer! Look, just come.

23
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:45,601
Thank you, officer! Thank you!

24
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,626
Here take your money!
I gave 50 to that police officer.

25
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:56,029
This is 25, count it.

26
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:02,793
Strange man!
If it's more, he won't take it!

27
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,208
If it's less, he won't say anything.

28
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:35,007
"The road was always the journey"

29
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:41,445
"Moments of peace were always short"

30
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:48,169
"The road was always the journey"

31
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:54,133
"Moments of peace were always short"

32
00:07:54,434 --> 00:08:00,787
"I found a story teller,
looking for a caravan"

33
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:05,754
"Just holding my breath"

34
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:12,933
"Confronted by the desert"

35
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:19,419
"I am a gypsy, what should I do?"

36
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:25,662
"Confronted by the desert"

37
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:32,934
"I am a gypsy, what should I do?"

38
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:39,009
You took so much of time
on the first day, itself?

39
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:40,158
I'm sorry!

40
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,216
It is very difficult to
do a double shift in this old age.

41
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:48,656
And you? You do three shifts!

42
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,936
What will you do
with so much money, son?

43
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,527
I have debt that has to be repaid.

44
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:57,194
Your wish!

45
00:08:58,439 --> 00:08:59,900
Take this key.

46
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:05,671
My life of double
shifts is now finished.

47
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,899
All the best, son! All the best.

48
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,008
'What a strategy!'

49
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,524
'He ducks,
he misses, and reminds him again.'

50
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,420
'Wow! What a fight!
Oh, another one! What a fight!'

51
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:24,914
'Oh! He's getting a hold!'

52
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:27,076
'Woah! And that's a...'

53
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:37,648
'What a kick! I think,
the match is going to end very soon.'

54
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,601
Hey guard, working or sleeping?

55
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:42,777
Idiot!

56
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,703
'It's almost a one sided match!'

57
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:51,153
Hey! Why did you turn it off?

58
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,773
Change the channel!

59
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,663
It must be almost
in 8 o'clock in India.

60
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,678
Please, put on my channel.

61
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,065
What is this?
You still haven't watered this?

62
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:03,476
I told you,
this has to be watered twice a day.

63
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,105
How many times have I told you?

64
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:08,375
As soon as it's almost 8 o'clock
in India, turn on my channel.

65
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:09,946
When will you understand?

66
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:12,551
Take this!

67
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,547
Take it!

68
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:17,096
What are you waiting for?
Catch it!

69
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:21,708
Now, what was the
need to bring all this...

70
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:26,428
It's your favorite carrot pudding,
uncle Usman.

71
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:30,654
Now, how many times have
I told you not to play with fire?

72
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:33,468
But, you?
just blah- blah- blah- blah- blah!

73
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,990
If the lecture is over,
taste it and tell me how it tastes?

74
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,350
Here, come on!

75
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,618
I don't like sweets.

76
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,634
Who are you?

77
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,916
What are you doing
in uncle Usman's cabin?

78
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:54,411
Uncle Usman has retired
today and I joined in his place.

79
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:55,329
Oh!

80
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,502
You're a native.

81
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,331
Strange fool you are!

82
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,716
Couldn't you tell me before?

83
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,068
You didn't give me a chance!

84
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:04,655
I will go to uncle Usman's
house and set him right!

85
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,312
Who just goes away without informing?

86
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,987
First of all, uncle Usman
is not here and to top it...

87
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:11,660
I don't know whether Bindiya's
mother-in-law will agree or not.

88
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,073
Mother-in-law?

89
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,645
She is very strict!

90
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:17,074
Poor Bindiya was just
about to apologize.

91
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:21,309
Now, her fat mother-in-law knows
she was lying to go to the office!

92
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,355
Who is Bindiya?

93
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:26,655
"I am the Bindiya (ornament)
of your forehead!"

94
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:28,605
It's the biggest hit
on Indian television.

95
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:29,435
Don't you watch it?

96
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,743
That's what uncle Usman
and I used to watch together.

97
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:33,956
Today, he ditched me!

98
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:38,175
Anyways,
if uncle Usman is not here, then...

99
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,693
I think I should leave, right?

100
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,078
Okay!

101
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,815
I think I should go.

102
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,664
If you wish you can come inside.

103
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,482
No, thanks! I'm fine.

104
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:35,284
The weather is bad and...

105
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:39,061
Bindiya should have
reached home by now.

106
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,913
- And her mother-in-law...
- Fat and strict!

107
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:44,885
I don't know how she's going to react.

108
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,704
What is her mother-in-law's name?

109
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:51,596
Kalavati!

110
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:55,127
'Kalavati is the name
of truth and the idol of love.'

111
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,430
'You have cheated Kalavati!'

112
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:59,372
'Cheated! Cheated!'

113
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:02,283
'Cheated! Cheated!'

114
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:08,127
'But, you forgot that
Kalavati wears glasses...'

115
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:11,063
so that if someone tries
to throw dust into her eyes...'

116
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:16,129
'the dust collides with
the glasses and falls to the ground!'

117
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:21,869
'The bond of mother-in-law and
daughter-in-law is a fragile wall...'

118
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:27,039
'but, you have kicked
down the wall of belief!'

119
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,411
'No, mother!
I haven't done anything of the sort.'

120
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:34,267
'I value the honor of this
family even more than my life!'

121
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:36,392
'Please forgive me!'

122
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:38,146
'The Suryavanshi family...'

123
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:44,621
'...then Kalavati will
not fail even once!'

124
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:50,445
'I am the Bindiya of your forehead!'

125
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:03,014
You haven't eaten this!

126
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,628
And one more thing.

127
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,216
I am telling you because
uncle Usman is not here.

128
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:22,132
This night jasmine has
to be watered twice a day.

129
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:23,029
Yes.

130
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,301
Can I get the address
for gym Thunderstorm?

131
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:14,870
Thank you.

132
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:28,628
Okay! So now, the structure we make,
needs a strong base.

133
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:32,152
While learning clay modeling,
we need to start with the base...

134
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:33,770
which is the armature.

135
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,279
So I hope all of you
are ready to learn...

136
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:37,699
how to make you first armature.

137
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,017
Yes!

138
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:40,193
Very good!

139
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,586
So, armatures can be
made of different material.

140
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:44,954
Like PWC pipes, wooden rods.

141
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:47,564
Just depends on how sturdy
you want the structure to be.

142
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:48,795
And you know...

143
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,856
You are so good, Jenny!

144
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,801
I mean, you are so hot!

145
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,715
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

146
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,796
I'm really, really impressed with you.

147
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,877
- What's your plan this evening?
- Me?

148
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:07,370
Yeah! Of course, you!

149
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:09,481
You definitely deserve a treat!

150
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,797
But today, Bindiya's husband will
take her on a romantic dinner date.

151
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:15,918
What?

152
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,893
Sorry, Mr. Chang! I'm busy tonight.

153
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,167
8 o'clock, channel 22!
Do watch it!

154
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:21,745
Come on! Hit me harder!

155
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,999
Come on, punch harder!
Use your body weight!

156
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:34,597
Stop!

157
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,680
Mercy is the boxer's biggest enemy!

158
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,920
Your opponent will
never do that for you!

159
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,921
So, box me harder now!
Come on! You can do it.

160
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,730
Use you left! Concentrate! Fight!

161
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,723
What happened?
Look here! Concentrate!

162
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,962
- Suraj!
- What?

163
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:13,405
I knew you would definitely
come here one day.

164
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:15,965
Come here you!

165
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:23,766
Forget about the past, Bossy!

166
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,367
You considered Suraj your own son.

167
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,936
He has returned after 3 years.

168
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,463
Let's hug and start all over again.

169
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:34,616
Trust me,
everything be like the old times.

170
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,656
Come here! What did you do to me?

171
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:41,497
Let me show you!

172
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:44,257
Look here! Look!

173
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:45,643
Look here!

174
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:48,818
I had to leave that posh locality...

175
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:51,898
and come and live here in this area!

176
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:56,578
I had a home which
I built with my hard work.

177
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:58,322
It got sold.

178
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:01,539
My wife loved me a lot.

179
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:04,100
She left me and returned to India.

180
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,159
All because of you!

181
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,860
And you think that
I will hire you again!

182
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,519
I will trust you again.

183
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:16,738
I did not come here to ask for work.
I have come to apologize.

184
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:18,301
Sorry.

185
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,121
You've come here to do me a favor.

186
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:23,062
Omi! He's come here to do me a favor.

187
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:26,346
Why don't you say it clearly?
You've come to see...

188
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,183
whether Srikant is still alive.

189
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,265
If he is alive, what is his plight?

190
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,576
Omi! Tell him...

191
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,018
Tell him to get out of my sight.

192
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,904
I never want to see his face again.
Get him out from here.

193
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:41,002
Get him out!

194
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:49,665
Suraj, you don't worry.
This guy is very haughty!

195
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,745
But, he loves you.

196
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:54,553
And his wife was going
to leave him anyway.

197
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:56,426
Now come on,
I will introduce you to the others.

198
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:57,719
Come on. Let's go.

199
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:03,425
Come on, boys! Come on! Come here!

200
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:06,349
Look who's here! This is Suraj.

201
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,227
We used to call him "Storm".

202
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:09,988
He was the champion in 2012.

203
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,999
There used to be no one left
to face him in the final round.

204
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,788
All the professional
players were defeated by him.

205
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:14,827
Hey Sikandar, come on here.

206
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,949
Nobody could play until
the last round with him.

207
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:18,037
That's Storm!

208
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:19,592
And I was one of them.

209
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:22,419
He knocked me out in 13 seconds.

210
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,789
Isn't it, Champ?

211
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,546
Sikandar!
Suraj, all these are old stories.

212
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:29,509
But, he is no less today!
He has worked very hard on himself.

213
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:32,279
He is the best MMA
fighter in Thunderstorm.

214
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,750
I saw him on TV. Not bad.

215
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:35,953
Oh, really?

216
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:37,249
Not bad!

217
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,909
Come on, then! Let's see.

218
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,072
What does good mean
and who is better?

219
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,670
I have given up fighting.

220
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,653
Why?

221
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,480
Have you lost your power?

222
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,673
- Or did you realize your true place?
- Sikander!

223
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,713
This is not the time
for this useless conversation.

224
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,513
He hasn't worn gloves for 3 years.

225
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,940
It will be seen later,
who will win and who will lose.

226
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:01,791
He gave up winning 3 years ago.

227
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:04,314
At that time he was the shining sun.

228
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,429
Today, he is the setting sun.

229
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:07,499
Come on, boss!

230
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,071
Okay, take it. Tell them.

231
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,864
Tell them how much
fire is still left in you.

232
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,768
- Boss, I have given up fighting.
- Boss!

233
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,756
Suraj!

234
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:20,677
This place is for boxers.

235
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,829
That too, only for winners.

236
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:27,658
Don't even think of looking this way,
forget about coming here!

237
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:32,871
Suraj!

238
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:48,840
'She was looking great!'

239
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,051
'Why dinner tonight?'

240
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:53,880
'It's nobody's birthday,
nor anniversary!'

241
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:55,297
'How can you say that, Bindiya?'

242
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:59,232
'Don't we go out without an occasion?'

243
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,633
If you don't mind,
can you please open the window?

244
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:07,598
Sorry, but I'm sensitive to smell.

245
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,219
Maybe you've had a work out,
that's why!

246
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:20,289
What clothes have you worn today?

247
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:24,048
It's a greenish T- shirt and...

248
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:27,088
Silly! I'm not talking about you,
I'm asking about Bindiya!

249
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,367
What do her earrings look like?

250
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:34,730
- Just like you!
- Really?

251
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:38,926
Wow! Bindiya is wearing
earrings just like mine.

252
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:45,709
Okay, now look at the TV and
tell me how Bindiya actually looks!

253
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:53,472
- I'll just be back.
- Okay

254
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,435
'You don't call him a killer,
you call him a murderer!'

255
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,128
'How does it matter whether
he is a killer or a murderer?'

256
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,375
'Will you kill me
now or after dinner?'

257
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,456
'Bindiya! A little romance...'

258
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,078
'My romance is not a joke!'

259
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:12,955
'I am the bindiya (ornament)
on your forehead'

260
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,929
Thank you! Bye!

261
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:37,192
Your...

262
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:40,465
tiffin.

263
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:44,093
Thanks!

264
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,122
What is inside this?

265
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:48,441
It's sugar.

266
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:49,937
What! Why?

267
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:53,948
- We're equal now.
- Oh, really?

268
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,295
Favor and debt, must be repaid
as soon as possible, Bindiya!

269
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:03,136
Sometimes, you behave
like Bindiya's husband Jignesh!

270
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:06,936
Anyway, I'm Jenny!

271
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:13,287
I'm shaking your hand,
not asking for it!

272
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:22,668
You are shy like a girl,
but your hand is quite solid.

273
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:24,160
What do you do?

274
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:28,871
Okay!

275
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:30,379
Bye! Thanks for the show.

276
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,139
And thanks for the sugar.

277
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:46,421
"Sounds! Tell me, what are these
sounds that I can hear nowadays"

278
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:55,102
"Knocking! Tell me, why are
these strange moments knocking?"

279
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:58,542
I'm shaking your hand,
not asking for it!

280
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:03,531
"There is something
that causes less sleep"

281
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:08,587
"There is something
that makes the eyes moist"

282
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:13,295
"There is something,
that if you say so"

283
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:17,885
"I will lay down
my life with a smile!"

284
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:06,314
"What can we call that
which exists between us?"

285
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:16,098
"What is love? It is a wave...
Come, let's flow with it together"

286
00:26:16,356 --> 00:26:21,283
- "Something that makes me lost"
- I'm talking about Bindiya, not you!

287
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:26,193
"There is something
that you could not sleep!"

288
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:35,840
"There is something that
both of us laughed until we cried!"

289
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:01,553
Hi! I'm so late!
Please, put the TV on.

290
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,638
There's water too?

291
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,031
New shoes?

292
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:12,786
No.

293
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,695
They're pretty old,
bought them quite sometime ago.

294
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,598
Okay.

295
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,238
What is Bindiya going to do today?

296
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,877
She is going to request her husband.

297
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,956
Jignesh is going to leave Bindiya
and go to Singapore for his new job.

298
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,800
Put the TV on, please.

299
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:31,521
- 'I don't want your money!'
- See? It's already started.

300
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:35,482
'Why are you crying like this,
darling?'

301
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:37,882
'I'm doing all this for you.'

302
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:41,202
'I don't need your money! I need you!'

303
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:46,919
'No matter what state we are in,
at least we are together.'

304
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,804
'Bindiya will not be able
to live without you, Jignesh!'

305
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:56,254
'She will die!'

306
00:27:57,888 --> 00:28:00,604
'Bindiya!
Please don't say such things.'

307
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,957
'I will die, before you.'

308
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:10,565
'My life is tied to yours.'

309
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:12,086
'Please!'

310
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:18,067
'What should I do?'

311
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:20,637
Jignesh is not doing the right thing!

312
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,545
You won't ever do that, right?

313
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:28,488
'I will be paid twice
as much money in Singapore.'

314
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:29,448
What does that mean?

315
00:28:29,612 --> 00:28:32,640
That means that you will not
leave your girlfriend for a new job!

316
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,929
'I will work there
and take care of you.'

317
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:37,448
It depends.

318
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:39,253
It depends?

319
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,123
What do you mean, it depends?

320
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:44,146
What is more necessary for you?
Old relationships or a new job?

321
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,210
I will never leave her and go.

322
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:50,608
Promise?

323
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:54,234
Promise!

324
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:56,257
Good!

325
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,403
Your girlfriend is very lucky.

326
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:02,675
I don't have a girlfriend.

327
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:06,533
Silly! You don't have one,
but you will one day.

328
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:09,893
Wherever she is today,
she is very lucky.

329
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,577
Because it's you in her life,
not Jignesh.

330
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:16,493
Handsome?

331
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,258
Like a typical Gujju guy, tall, fair!

332
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:26,359
Silly, I'm not talking about Jignesh,
I'm talking about you!

333
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,177
What do you look like?

334
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:29,174
Tell me.

335
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,987
Don't bluff because I can't see, okay?

336
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:38,836
People call me rough and tough.

337
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:43,439
That means you're not very handsome.

338
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:46,919
Okay, bye!

339
00:30:05,964 --> 00:30:07,566
Ahh! Ouch!

340
00:30:08,482 --> 00:30:09,684
Aww!

341
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,965
Don't move! Are you alright?

342
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:20,222
Oh no.

343
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:34,520
How many days since we became friends?

344
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:40,103
Since Bindiya apologized to
the time Jignesh goes to Singapore.

345
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,205
That means, 6 days.

346
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:46,585
And you haven't even told
me your name in these 6 days!

347
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,521
Suraj.

348
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,258
Suraj...

349
00:30:58,906 --> 00:30:59,828
Suraj!

350
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:02,147
Suraj... what?

351
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:03,906
Suraj Singh Rathore?

352
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,146
Suraj Uday Pratap Chauhan!

353
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,585
What is your full name?

354
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:14,214
The one who gave me a name,
only gave me this much.

355
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:17,266
I have never wanted
to have more than that...

356
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,685
nor was it in my destiny
to have more than that.

357
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:21,985
Wow!

358
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:25,473
You should be writing the
dialogues of a show like Bindiya.

359
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,149
You narrated your whole
life's history in just one line!

360
00:31:29,342 --> 00:31:32,790
But, don't worry. I don't
know about your life until now...

361
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,691
but from now onwards,
Jenny will never let you...

362
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,231
miss Rathore or Chauhan.

363
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:41,097
If I have made a friend,
I will be a friend until the end.

364
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:02,114
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

365
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:05,678
I cannot walk anymore.

366
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:07,743
Let me sit down for a while.

367
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:13,435
There is a bench over there.
You can rest there for some time.

368
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:16,916
Careful!

369
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:19,276
- Careful!
- Thanks.

370
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:26,355
Listen!

371
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:29,717
If you want you can go home.

372
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:34,557
I mean, if there is someone
waiting for you at home.

373
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:37,838
- If you want, I can...
- What can you do?

374
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:39,998
I mean, I can...

375
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:43,838
You mean, you will carry me
on your shoulders and drop me home?

376
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:45,239
Right!

377
00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:49,719
It's not a bad idea.
But, think about it.

378
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,905
You may regret it midway!

379
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:55,337
Yes, I've thought about it.

380
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,255
Okay!

381
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:23,945
- Okay.
- Okay.

382
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:43,765
- Now?
- Have we passed the garage?

383
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:44,532
Yes.

384
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,094
Now, turn left from here.

385
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:48,863
Just a little way more.

386
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:57,431
Have we passed the mosque?

387
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:58,489
Yes.

388
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,288
Yes, that's gone too.

389
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,010
Then, we've reached.

390
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,728
No, no. I mean almost reached.

391
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,368
See, there is a broken
down beauty parlor on the left.

392
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,227
Yes.

393
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:12,490
There some stairs just ahead of it.

394
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:14,097
Yes.

395
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,156
It's above those stairs.

396
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,050
Upstairs?

397
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:23,386
If you're tired, I'll manage.

398
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:34,172
That's it.
Can you see that gate on the left?

399
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:36,063
- Yes.
- We have to go inside there.

400
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,614
Not here! Just one floor above.

401
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:54,441
What happened?
Are you tired?

402
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,967
You said, you were a tough guy!

403
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,762
Perfect! Just here.

404
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:07,026
Ouch!

405
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:17,867
I'll go.

406
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:20,898
Just a minute.

407
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:24,346
Can you just do me one last favor?

408
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:25,978
Please.

409
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,615
There is a cloth stuck here.

410
00:35:35,692 --> 00:35:36,750
A cloth?

411
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,148
It's an innerwear.

412
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:47,695
Thanks!

413
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:03,383
One minute!

414
00:36:13,814 --> 00:36:14,341
Here.

415
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,015
Two tickets to the music concert.

416
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:20,225
Consider it a gift
for dropping me here.

417
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:23,696
I don't like music.

418
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,386
And there is no one
to go along with me.

419
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:34,026
I could have gone with you,
but you don't like music, so.

420
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:35,994
No!

421
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:39,104
It's not like that.

422
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:42,537
We can go.

423
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,502
I'll pick you up.

424
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,357
Thank you.

425
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:12,620
Hi!

426
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,994
Should we go?

427
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:32,322
"Playing the guitar with twist melody"

428
00:38:32,684 --> 00:38:35,607
"The youngster become impatient"

429
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:38,361
"The quick and fast rhythm"

430
00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:39,362
The concert is there.

431
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,561
"Their hearts leap with joy"

432
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:44,882
"Searching for partners"

433
00:38:45,646 --> 00:38:48,182
"What a beautiful rhythm"

434
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:53,005
"All are welcome to dance"

435
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:56,164
I have come to a concert
after a long time.

436
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:57,804
Thank you, Suraj.

437
00:38:58,163 --> 00:39:00,301
There is an Indian
restaurant close by.

438
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:02,844
I used to go there
with someone special.

439
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:05,047
My first love!

440
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:07,893
I don't know whether
it's still here.

441
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,228
Who was he?

442
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,208
Who?

443
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:33,087
Your first love?

444
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:38,482
Silly!

445
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:40,229
I was talking about my dad.

446
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:43,142
This was his favorite place.
We came here very often.

447
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:51,134
Enough about me.
Tell me about yourself.

448
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,811
Were you always like this?

449
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:55,771
Haughty and speaking very little?

450
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:57,598
The serious kind?

451
00:39:57,843 --> 00:40:00,451
Or did you have a humorous side?

452
00:40:09,214 --> 00:40:12,973
You know, Bindiya says,
that people who speak less...

453
00:40:13,415 --> 00:40:15,954
have a volcano of
memories in them.

454
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:19,413
They keep on moving
around in those memories.

455
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:21,768
Do you have anything like that?

456
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,415
You know, Bindiya also says...

457
00:40:26,636 --> 00:40:29,574
people who speak less
are either very nice...

458
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,175
or very evil.

459
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:34,605
They can die for somebody
or they can kill for them too.

460
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,325
And I have heard that blind people
talk more than necessary!

461
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:59,989
We lost track of time
while talking.

462
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:05,191
I need to leave.

463
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:29,104
Suraj, now you are our only hope.

464
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:32,703
Sikandar ditched us to
make more money.

465
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:35,703
Now, forget everything
and come back to us.

466
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:38,304
Because, if you're in the race,
we're in the race.

467
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:40,253
These hands will never
be raised on anybody.

468
00:41:40,692 --> 00:41:42,233
I told you, didn't I?

469
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:46,505
We're wasting our time with him.

470
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:49,945
If he was one of my own...

471
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:52,910
he would come at least once to
check on how I am.

472
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,653
He wouldn't have disappeared
for three years after destroying me.

473
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,122
This is not the man
whom I considered my son!

474
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:04,105
I was in jail.

475
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:14,663
I was in a jail in Kuala Lumpur
for 2 years and 7 months.

476
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:21,606
Winning that fight 3 years ago
was not only your dream.

477
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:22,986
It was mine too!

478
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:25,233
The date of the fight
is fixed, Suraj.

479
00:42:26,497 --> 00:42:29,199
Just know that I am taking
the biggest risk of my life.

480
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:31,270
You are confident, aren't you?

481
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,664
Oh come on, boss! If he wants...

482
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,830
he can break anybody's jaws and
put the teeth on a table before you.

483
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,870
Right, Suraj?

484
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:41,750
Now that you have taken an advance,
then why be scared?

485
00:42:41,972 --> 00:42:43,032
Hey!

486
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:50,527
The night before the fight
a woman came to me.

487
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:54,712
My name is Natasha.

488
00:42:55,245 --> 00:42:57,216
And she asked me to lose the fight.

489
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,793
I have only one daughter, Alisha.

490
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:03,234
She told me that my opponent
Ali's daughter had cancer.

491
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,148
And that if I won the fight...

492
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:08,791
he would never be able to
get her medical treatment.

493
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:15,123
Please save her.

494
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,572
Please.

495
00:43:37,237 --> 00:43:39,134
You have come to the wrong address.

496
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:56,320
Come on, Suraj!

497
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:04,462
Yeah!

498
00:44:04,882 --> 00:44:07,056
Suraj!

499
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:09,095
Suraj!

500
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:11,595
Suraj!

501
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,949
Suraj!

502
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:19,224
Dad!

503
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:26,725
Dad! Dad!

504
00:44:27,115 --> 00:44:28,120
Dad!

505
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:32,035
- Come on, Suraj!
- What is he doing!?

506
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:35,950
Dad!

507
00:44:40,065 --> 00:44:41,366
Hit him more!

508
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:49,237
Dad!

509
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,399
One!

510
00:44:58,254 --> 00:45:00,266
I had almost won that fight!

511
00:45:01,052 --> 00:45:03,968
But, when I saw that
little girl's innocent face

512
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:06,489
I stopped fighting.

513
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:11,652
I thought, I would have
other fights to win.

514
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:16,625
But, that little girl had
only one life to live.

515
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,464
Suraj!

516
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:27,633
Yay! Dad won!

517
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,414
For the first time,
I wasn't sad to lose.

518
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:39,613
I had saved a life.

519
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:42,162
Suraj! What was this, Suraj?

520
00:45:42,401 --> 00:45:43,933
Why are you asking him?

521
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:47,136
He's lost and hiding out here.

522
00:45:47,442 --> 00:45:50,533
You led down the one who
mentored you!

523
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:52,734
You wanted money, didn't you?

524
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:55,535
You could have asked me!
I would have given you money.

525
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:57,879
You have destroyed me!

526
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:15,130
What are you doing here?

527
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,777
Hey, you!
Don't touch her.

528
00:46:19,052 --> 00:46:20,211
Who are you?

529
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:22,066
Don't dare touch my kid...

530
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,200
You talk to me,
if you want her, okay?

531
00:46:25,743 --> 00:46:28,564
Then, I realized that all
this was a drama.

532
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,636
Everything inside me
died that day.

533
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,224
I decided, I would
become an evil man.

534
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:06,257
So evil, that I forgot myself!

535
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:10,371
After my fighting license
got cancelled...

536
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,473
I started fighting
outside the ring.

537
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,839
I started doing extortion work.

538
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:20,147
Hey what do you want?

539
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:25,845
Why did you go to jail?

540
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:31,666
It was the last night of the year.

541
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,079
Or maybe the first morning of
the new year.

542
00:47:37,153 --> 00:47:39,867
Everybody was welcoming
the new year.

543
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:43,392
And I was just doing my work.

544
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:57,071
Don't come close to me.

545
00:47:57,353 --> 00:47:58,709
I give you money.

546
00:47:59,414 --> 00:48:00,986
That's all I have.

547
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:02,706
I have no more money.

548
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:06,473
'Foreign language.'

549
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,605
'Foreign language.'

550
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,806
'Foreign language.'

551
00:48:20,915 --> 00:48:22,076
Open the door!

552
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Police!

553
00:48:25,146 --> 00:48:28,144
Open the door!
We have complaints against you.

554
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:29,697
Open the door!

555
00:48:31,135 --> 00:48:32,300
Open the door!

556
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:36,714
Open the door!

557
00:49:02,947 --> 00:49:05,058
I still look after him.

558
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:10,319
So that the wounds on my heart
heal with the wounds on his body.

559
00:49:10,937 --> 00:49:15,214
Suraj, the handicapped children
of my orphanage have made this.

560
00:49:15,712 --> 00:49:17,393
Do you have a girlfriend?

561
00:49:18,268 --> 00:49:19,691
Go give this to her.

562
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:22,089
The love between you will double.

563
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:23,712
God bless!

564
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:52,848
- Celebrate tonight.
- Who is it?

565
00:49:53,914 --> 00:49:54,870
Who's there?

566
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:00,326
It's me, Jenny darling!

567
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,968
Mr. Chang!
What are you doing here?

568
00:50:03,308 --> 00:50:05,364
I've been waiting for you.

569
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,610
- Let's go!
- Mr. Chang.

570
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:30,887
I have got my own juice.

571
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:35,268
- Mr. Chang, please leave!
- You can forget about your juice.

572
00:50:38,227 --> 00:50:39,785
Let us have fun.

573
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:43,415
I brought for our
special night tonight.

574
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,570
Please leave.
We'll talk in the office tomorrow.

575
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:46,377
No!

576
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:52,173
Tonight, you listen to me!

577
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:57,249
You must stay here
and drink this.

578
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:00,858
No!

579
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,793
I'll see to it,
that we will party tonight.

580
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,838
Get out! Mr. Chang,
leave!

581
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:21,044
How dare you insult me?

582
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:24,484
You never cared about my feelings.

583
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:30,467
I'll make sure,
you don't do this to me anymore.

584
00:51:31,142 --> 00:51:33,002
Just leave! Get out!

585
00:51:37,774 --> 00:51:38,976
Son of a...

586
00:51:39,374 --> 00:51:39,973
Get out!

587
00:51:40,049 --> 00:51:40,880
Suraj!

588
00:51:45,574 --> 00:51:46,413
Suraj, no!

589
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:49,285
No!

590
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:50,697
No!

591
00:51:51,419 --> 00:51:53,658
- Stop it!
- This time I've broken your fingers.

592
00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:55,458
Next time, I'll break
your freaking neck!

593
00:51:55,594 --> 00:51:57,017
Suraj, please stop!

594
00:52:08,476 --> 00:52:10,100
Why did you do that, Suraj?

595
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:12,478
He's my boss!

596
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,381
Tomorrow, he will tell
the entire management.

597
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,409
I will lose my job!

598
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,212
Do you still want to work with him?

599
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:22,772
Then what else should I do?

600
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:26,178
Is there any place in the world...

601
00:52:26,406 --> 00:52:29,079
where a single girl
is not harassed?

602
00:52:30,626 --> 00:52:33,830
Is there any office where
bosses like him don't exist?

603
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:37,082
Should I leave my job?

604
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:39,165
Should I give up living my life?

605
00:52:39,354 --> 00:52:41,694
Who will take care
of my expenses?

606
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,766
- I will look after you.
- Why?

607
00:52:48,094 --> 00:52:49,917
Who are you to me?

608
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,315
Who am I to you?

609
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:03,877
You cannot do anything, Suraj.

610
00:53:05,614 --> 00:53:07,665
Apart from increasing my troubles.

611
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:11,540
Please, leave me alone.

612
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,525
Please! Leave me alone.

613
00:53:21,863 --> 00:53:27,928
"Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?"

614
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:37,317
"Why do I weave dreams
of you every moment?"

615
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:45,471
"Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?"

616
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:50,232
"Why do I weave dreams of
you every moment?"

617
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:54,773
"You taught me the art of living"

618
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:59,019
"Gave me the patience
to silently bear things"

619
00:53:59,346 --> 00:54:04,094
"You are the faith of life"

620
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,794
"You are my courage"

621
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:12,941
"You taught me the art of
living and dying"

622
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:17,461
"My loyalty to you
has made me like you"

623
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:22,115
"You taught me the art of
living and dying"

624
00:54:22,366 --> 00:54:27,545
"My loyalty to you has
made me like you"

625
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:56,298
"My loneliness is lost
in thoughts of you"

626
00:54:57,245 --> 00:55:04,918
"Now, my soul is
looking after you"

627
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:21,800
"My loneliness is lost
in thoughts of you"

628
00:55:22,604 --> 00:55:31,303
"Now, my soul is looking
after you"

629
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:38,896
"You are the faith of life
and you are my courage"

630
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:45,085
"You taught me the art of
living and dying"

631
00:55:45,356 --> 00:55:50,377
"My loyalty to you
has made me like you"

632
00:55:52,672 --> 00:56:01,488
"Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?"

633
00:56:02,386 --> 00:56:10,000
"Why do I weave dreams
of you every moment?"

634
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:18,730
"You taught me the art of living"

635
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:26,107
"Gave me the patience
to silently bear things"

636
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:33,868
"You are the faith of life"

637
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:39,094
"You are my courage"

638
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,115
Hi!

639
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:52,753
Hi!

640
00:56:55,032 --> 00:56:59,735
I thought about it
the whole day and left my job.

641
00:57:03,065 --> 00:57:03,748
Good!

642
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,434
Now, I'm not used to sitting at home.

643
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,323
So, I thought I'd ask you...

644
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,511
will you take me out this weekend?

645
00:57:17,048 --> 00:57:19,396
You said,
you would look after me.

646
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,124
Always!

647
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:34,538
The orphanage where
I grew up was here.

648
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:37,304
And then one day, a storm came...

649
00:57:38,299 --> 00:57:40,477
and everything
got washed away.

650
00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:45,554
Now, whenever I'm lonely, or...

651
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:50,086
I am sad,
then I come here.

652
00:57:54,977 --> 00:57:56,935
Are you lonely and sad
today as well?

653
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:01,330
No!

654
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,418
For the first time today...

655
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:09,244
I have come to share
my happiness with this place.

656
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:23,854
Found it?

657
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:24,776
Umm-hmm.

658
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,217
Carefully!

659
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:32,313
Perfect!

660
00:58:35,627 --> 00:58:37,889
Now, this is the foundation
of our home.

661
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:39,196
Okay? Wait.

662
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:48,868
These pebbles are the symbol
of the foundation.

663
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,252
Always keep them with you.

664
00:58:54,704 --> 00:58:56,673
They will always remind you of me.

665
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,848
And this, I will always keep with me.

666
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:05,853
I will also come here to share
my happiness and sorrow.

667
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:12,129
And you will find me here.

668
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,430
But you didn't want to raise
your hand, right?

669
00:59:21,472 --> 00:59:22,669
Now let it go, my friend.

670
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:24,733
You son is home,
give him your blessings.

671
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:26,672
Stop asking useless questions!

672
00:59:27,153 --> 00:59:28,595
I want an answer.

673
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,498
He wants to settle down.

674
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,619
He has fallen in love.

675
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:46,480
But explain to him
very clearly...

676
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:51,161
his love should not come
in the way of my boxing.

677
01:00:11,658 --> 01:00:15,598
"Rise! Young lad"

678
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:21,482
"Blood speaks!"

679
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:29,093
"Filled in each and every vein"

680
01:00:30,946 --> 01:00:35,887
"passion speaks"

681
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:52,441
"Rise, young lad. The blood speaks,
the passion in your veins speaks"

682
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:57,383
"Comes let's make up an iron mind,
and say the word"

683
01:00:57,525 --> 01:00:59,942
"Let's fill the cage
with passion of winning..."

684
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:02,160
"Let's love the pain"

685
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:06,990
"Become crazy, take courage to a high
and make all our difficulties easy"

686
01:01:07,124 --> 01:01:12,005
"Stay awake the whole night, dream
with open eyes - this is my curse"

687
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:16,700
"Make all our difficulties disappear"

688
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:22,783
"The sweat of blood,
my chest swells with my courage"

689
01:01:24,454 --> 01:01:27,082
This is our new home.

690
01:01:28,828 --> 01:01:32,251
There is a sweet little
balcony over here.

691
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:33,535
From here...

692
01:01:33,612 --> 01:01:35,877
From where the sunshine
comes straight inside.

693
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:37,110
How do you know?

694
01:01:42,382 --> 01:01:45,955
I have always seen the sun
without my eyes.

695
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,767
But, the sun has never
looked into my eyes.

696
01:01:49,948 --> 01:01:51,603
Look into my eyes, Suraj.

697
01:01:53,491 --> 01:01:54,669
You are looking into them, right?

698
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,545
Yes.

699
01:01:57,683 --> 01:01:58,582
Lies!

700
01:02:01,532 --> 01:02:03,778
I can see everything
even without sight.

701
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:08,253
And even though
you have eyes...

702
01:02:24,457 --> 01:02:26,334
'Foreign language.'

703
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:28,447
The one who will look
after me has arrived.

704
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,945
Now, I can come
every day to help you.

705
01:02:34,307 --> 01:02:39,046
"Rise, young lad. The blood speaks,
the passion in your veins speaks"

706
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:43,862
"Let's die and let's
say the word"

707
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:48,649
"Like a heart of iron,
a gypsy who loves pain"

708
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:53,496
"Become crazy, take courage to a high
and make all our difficulties easy"

709
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,379
"Stay awake the whole night, dream
with open eyes, this is my curse"

710
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:02,624
"Let's break together and make
all our difficulties disappear"

711
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:07,739
"The sweat of blood, my chest swells
with my courage"

712
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:12,980
"Let's break together and make
all our difficulties disappear"

713
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:16,912
"The sweat of blood, my chest swells
with my courage"

714
01:03:17,052 --> 01:03:18,191
Tell me more.

715
01:03:18,576 --> 01:03:19,426
Suraj!

716
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:31,362
Okay, Stop! Suraj, no!

717
01:03:31,877 --> 01:03:33,583
Okay. Time out! Time out!

718
01:03:33,704 --> 01:03:36,799
Time out! Turn around!

719
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:45,118
Looks like you didn't find any
patient in the hospital on Sunday.

720
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,693
Just shut up!

721
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:49,583
You boxers are
are as good as patients.

722
01:03:55,986 --> 01:03:57,781
You know, your back is really weird.

723
01:03:59,022 --> 01:04:00,750
The curve between
your lumbar spine...

724
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:04,975
and the thoracic spine
is very little.

725
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:06,897
So, there is a problem
even with my back!

726
01:04:07,072 --> 01:04:10,126
While massaging, you've begun to
imagine yourself as a doctor!

727
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:12,147
- Doctor Jenny!
- Obviously!

728
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:13,548
I'm a qualified nurse.

729
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:16,433
They won't even let me enter
the hospital without this knowledge.

730
01:04:18,828 --> 01:04:20,908
If we collect some money...

731
01:04:21,677 --> 01:04:25,108
then I could open
a little school for you.

732
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,308
How sweet!

733
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:30,314
So that you can spend
some time with your art...

734
01:04:31,515 --> 01:04:32,924
and not just with your patients.

735
01:04:33,048 --> 01:04:35,287
Oh! And who will you
spend your time with?

736
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:36,586
Let me think.

737
01:04:39,896 --> 01:04:40,822
What should I say?

738
01:04:41,429 --> 01:04:42,434
You'll think?

739
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:44,279
Are you serious?

740
01:04:46,326 --> 01:04:47,073
No.

741
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:57,597
"The threads of a relationship between
us are beginning to take shape"

742
01:04:58,822 --> 01:05:07,250
"My uneasiness has now begun to
find some peacefulness"

743
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:23,196
"The threads of a relationship between
us are beginning to take shape"

744
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:32,729
"My uneasiness has now begun
to find some peacefulness"

745
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:40,598
"You are my faith in life,
you are my courage"

746
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:46,774
"You taught me how
to live and die"

747
01:05:46,982 --> 01:05:51,225
"My faith has made me like you"

748
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:55,999
"You taught me how to live and die"

749
01:05:56,211 --> 01:06:00,905
"My faith has made me like you"

750
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,595
Suraj!

751
01:06:07,439 --> 01:06:08,701
You have done this, right?

752
01:06:08,944 --> 01:06:10,841
How dare you?
Hold this.

753
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:22,269
I'm sorry!

754
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:31,984
Silly boy!

755
01:06:33,518 --> 01:06:36,661
We live in Malaysia.
But, we're still Indians.

756
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,317
Who is going to seek permission
from my parents?

757
01:06:52,631 --> 01:06:53,964
Ask them, silly.

758
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:10,857
I don't speak too much.

759
01:07:11,678 --> 01:07:13,259
I will only say that...

760
01:07:17,874 --> 01:07:19,968
I will keep your
daughter very happy.

761
01:08:10,082 --> 01:08:13,098
You never told me
how they died.

762
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:15,703
What should I say?

763
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:18,412
It was the first
night of the New Year.

764
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:24,673
But for me, that night left behind
a lifetime of darkness.

765
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:33,579
Dad had stopped all his urgent work
and was with us since two days.

766
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,830
And I was driving.

767
01:08:56,753 --> 01:08:59,845
And then that
fateful accident happened.

768
01:10:04,328 --> 01:10:07,693
But for me, that night left
behind a lifetime of darkness.

769
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,387
My parents always wanted
the best for me.

770
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:22,913
They worry about me even
though they have gone so far away.

771
01:10:24,778 --> 01:10:27,246
That's why they found you
and sent you to me.

772
01:10:34,789 --> 01:10:36,511
Thanks for coming
in my life, Suraj.

773
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:26,535
Jenny!

774
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:30,000
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Jenny Mathias.

775
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,773
Oh! Okay. Ask the doctor.

776
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:33,304
Okay, thank you, sir.

777
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,202
Excuse me doctor,
I'm with Jenny Mathias.

778
01:11:35,318 --> 01:11:36,882
- Oh, Hi.
- Is she okay?

779
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,713
It was a little cut, not too much.

780
01:11:40,927 --> 01:11:44,282
She was lucky you know,
because the piece didn't dig in.

781
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,919
- Can I take her home?
- Sure!

782
01:11:49,024 --> 01:11:52,484
But remember, next time,
don't leave her alone. Alright?

783
01:11:53,453 --> 01:11:54,123
Okay?

784
01:11:54,221 --> 01:11:56,181
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

785
01:11:57,548 --> 01:12:00,525
Oh! Why did you come?
I was about to come home.

786
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,834
It's nothing!
It's just a cut.

787
01:12:21,985 --> 01:12:24,725
It's cornea damage,
causing visual impairment.

788
01:12:25,459 --> 01:12:29,385
But, sight can be restored in
such cases with an operation.

789
01:12:29,949 --> 01:12:30,671
Really?

790
01:12:30,922 --> 01:12:31,528
Yes!

791
01:12:32,025 --> 01:12:34,573
But, you have already
delayed it too much.

792
01:12:34,926 --> 01:12:35,809
What do you mean?

793
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:38,889
That means, 15 - 20 days.

794
01:12:39,482 --> 01:12:40,950
One month at the maximum.

795
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:44,047
After that, even this operation
would be useless.

796
01:12:44,506 --> 01:12:46,450
If the operation is done
within a month, then...

797
01:12:46,526 --> 01:12:48,610
can the sight in her eyes
be restored?

798
01:12:48,747 --> 01:12:52,453
Yes, but we will have
to import the cornea from the US.

799
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:55,246
What will the expenditure be?

800
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:08,458
Come on, suraj.

801
01:13:09,547 --> 01:13:10,639
Suraj!

802
01:13:12,098 --> 01:13:12,934
Come on.

803
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:26,588
Come on, breathe!
Breathe!

804
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:28,735
Defend yourself,
get him on the jaw!

805
01:13:28,852 --> 01:13:30,098
Why don't you elbow him?

806
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,519
Come on! Don't hold back.

807
01:13:40,472 --> 01:13:41,805
Come on!

808
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:50,670
Come on!

809
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:55,833
Suraj!

810
01:14:08,522 --> 01:14:09,219
Yes.

811
01:14:09,714 --> 01:14:12,425
- Well done.
- Good job, my boy.

812
01:14:14,181 --> 01:14:16,379
Until Jenny gets her eyes back...

813
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:19,739
I will keep thinking
about this, Omi.

814
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,128
I need a lot of money for that.

815
01:14:22,705 --> 01:14:25,159
Suraj, who doesn't need money?

816
01:14:26,013 --> 01:14:27,960
But, Srikant is not
in the right shape.

817
01:14:28,165 --> 01:14:30,303
Neither can he help you, nor can I.

818
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,518
But, you can't let that affect
you, friend.

819
01:14:36,303 --> 01:14:40,257
And you will never get
any money fighting for them.

820
01:14:40,784 --> 01:14:43,509
I saw you fighting, not bad.

821
01:14:43,848 --> 01:14:48,692
One should not be angry with a man
who sells his soul for money...

822
01:14:48,807 --> 01:14:50,159
one should pity him.

823
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:52,912
I trained him for 2 years.

824
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:56,276
But, he still left and joined
Gavin's club for money.

825
01:14:56,669 --> 01:14:57,945
Let's see how long
he stays there.

826
01:14:58,087 --> 01:15:01,616
I got what I didn't get in 2 years,
within 2 weeks.

827
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,875
When you are fed up of
fighting this small fights...

828
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:08,760
and feel like fighting
with a real man...

829
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,427
then come to me.

830
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:14,104
You will get money.

831
01:15:14,695 --> 01:15:17,169
And all your desires
will also be fulfilled.

832
01:15:27,253 --> 01:15:28,707
Think about it, there will be pain.

833
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,968
Jenny will be more hurt,
if she touches it.

834
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:34,464
Your wish!

835
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,618
I was thinking about you.

836
01:15:53,763 --> 01:15:56,872
I've told you so many times not to
do all this work when I am not home.

837
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:02,353
But, I can't get anything done
when you are around.

838
01:16:06,533 --> 01:16:07,954
Suraj! What happened?

839
01:16:09,163 --> 01:16:10,434
Are you alright, Suraj?

840
01:16:11,307 --> 01:16:12,140
What happened?

841
01:16:12,629 --> 01:16:13,403
Nothing.

842
01:16:14,534 --> 01:16:16,174
Oh! I'm absolutely fine.

843
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,421
100%.

844
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:22,833
If I could see...

845
01:16:24,141 --> 01:16:26,145
would you still lie to me like this?

846
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:01,521
I knew you would come.

847
01:17:02,671 --> 01:17:05,652
I didn't know
it would be that soon.

848
01:17:06,091 --> 01:17:06,681
Drink.

849
01:17:08,264 --> 01:17:09,923
I need money, Sikandar.

850
01:17:11,196 --> 01:17:13,671
It is need that takes
a man to his destination.

851
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:15,579
Tell me, what is your need?

852
01:17:17,412 --> 01:17:18,254
300,000.

853
01:17:19,249 --> 01:17:21,683
That's all? If you work
at Gavin's club...

854
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:25,047
then your needs will be
fulfilled in 3 or 4 months.

855
01:17:27,193 --> 01:17:29,359
Jenny doesn't have
that much time, Sikandar.

856
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:31,803
I need that money in 15 days.

857
01:17:32,363 --> 01:17:35,383
Gavin never gives such a big advance
even to family!

858
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,025
Sit!

859
01:17:47,315 --> 01:17:49,756
Look, now the matter
is about love.

860
01:17:50,645 --> 01:17:52,918
So Sikandar
will have to do something.

861
01:17:54,496 --> 01:17:55,820
If you need a bigger rate...

862
01:17:56,846 --> 01:17:58,447
then you have to do a bigger job.

863
01:17:58,586 --> 01:17:59,461
I will do it.

864
01:18:00,407 --> 01:18:01,200
Cheers!

865
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:51,518
Why are you crying?

866
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:54,176
Okay dear, sorry!
I shouldn't have brought you here.

867
01:18:54,328 --> 01:18:56,089
I'm not crying because
of that, silly!

868
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:56,826
Then?

869
01:18:57,486 --> 01:19:00,832
I'm crying because you didn't bring
me to such a nice place before!

870
01:19:01,056 --> 01:19:03,594
Come on, let's do it again!
Single ticket, double fun! Come on!

871
01:19:05,528 --> 01:19:06,597
What happened?

872
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:12,993
The fun would actually have doubled,
if only you were able to see.

873
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:15,288
You are my eyes!

874
01:19:16,811 --> 01:19:17,488
Come on.

875
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:22,210
You knew that the operation
would have cured your sight.

876
01:19:25,254 --> 01:19:27,018
What's happened to you?
Come on!

877
01:19:27,507 --> 01:19:31,015
You knew that the cornea
could be imported from the US.

878
01:19:31,631 --> 01:19:33,896
Yes, I knew! But, I also knew...

879
01:19:33,973 --> 01:19:36,820
that it would be impossible to
collect so much money. Let's go.

880
01:19:37,703 --> 01:19:39,442
You could have told me at least.

881
01:19:40,672 --> 01:19:42,928
What's happened to you?
Why are you wasting so much time?

882
01:19:43,006 --> 01:19:45,039
The park will close. Come on!

883
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,060
The doctor has said that...

884
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,825
you have only 15 - 20 days.

885
01:19:52,203 --> 01:19:53,959
- Don't you want...
- No, I don't want.

886
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:01,812
I don't want to see a world
where my mom and dad don't exist.

887
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,543
Wherever your parents are, they...

888
01:20:10,161 --> 01:20:11,303
will be very sad.

889
01:20:12,452 --> 01:20:16,304
Imagine, how happy they will be,
if you can see again.

890
01:20:17,239 --> 01:20:20,066
And don't you want to
see this silly guy's face?

891
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:26,765
But where will we get
so much money from?

892
01:20:41,882 --> 01:20:42,684
Work!

893
01:20:44,827 --> 01:20:46,165
Can you take a life?

894
01:20:47,675 --> 01:20:48,422
Sorry!

895
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:51,045
Can you give your life?

896
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,572
There is freestyle in Langkawi.

897
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:10,272
Will you play?

898
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,060
That's why I'm here.

899
01:21:12,373 --> 01:21:15,546
But, you have to fight to lose.

900
01:21:18,352 --> 01:21:21,587
And there is no need to tell you
that it is completely illegal!

901
01:21:23,585 --> 01:21:26,604
If you get caught,
the entire responsibility is yours...

902
01:21:27,942 --> 01:21:29,427
and only yours.

903
01:21:51,516 --> 01:21:55,544
I am thinking,
that if I get my sight back...

904
01:21:56,005 --> 01:21:58,576
then we will go to that
lake first.

905
01:21:59,245 --> 01:22:01,510
Where I've laid the
foundation of our home.

906
01:22:02,566 --> 01:22:04,359
Then, I will look at Oscar.

907
01:22:04,605 --> 01:22:07,961
I will look at the sunset,
I will look at the water in the lake.

908
01:22:08,037 --> 01:22:08,867
And me?

909
01:22:10,161 --> 01:22:12,767
I would have already seen you, silly!

910
01:22:13,839 --> 01:22:15,685
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

911
01:22:17,978 --> 01:22:20,541
Suppose I don't turn out like you...

912
01:22:21,507 --> 01:22:22,311
How?

913
01:22:23,742 --> 01:22:26,274
- The way you think I am.
- How do I imagine you?

914
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:30,519
I mean... you know... like...

915
01:22:31,421 --> 01:22:33,620
You mean, the silly
and ugly types?

916
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,904
- You'll be terribly disappointed!
- Really?

917
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,830
Because, neither am I ugly,
nor am I silly!

918
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:51,302
'One more thing...'

919
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:55,842
'if you don't want your
family to land in any trouble...'

920
01:22:58,164 --> 01:23:01,629
'then you have to destroy every
identification that you have.'

921
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:07,491
'Even your family's life can be
endangered in such illegal fights.'

922
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:12,725
'So destroy every identification
of yours before you leave.'

923
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,523
'So that nobody can trace you.'

924
01:23:19,365 --> 01:23:22,087
'You will get a new name and
passport within two days.'

925
01:23:52,769 --> 01:23:55,886
'You will never leave your
girlfriend for a new job?'

926
01:23:56,595 --> 01:23:57,512
'Promise?'

927
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:03,788
You've gone out of your mind!

928
01:24:04,452 --> 01:24:06,572
Will you fight for that
ungrateful, Gavin?

929
01:24:06,846 --> 01:24:08,773
- Just this once!
- Oh, really?

930
01:24:09,557 --> 01:24:11,825
And what if you're finished
during that one time?

931
01:24:12,576 --> 01:24:14,855
Suraj, the fight
you're talking about...

932
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,990
has 6 out of 10 fighters dying.

933
01:24:17,538 --> 01:24:19,949
The rest are crippled for life.

934
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:22,946
Otherwise also, I'm not alive
in the real sense of the word!

935
01:24:23,924 --> 01:24:26,382
I cannot bring
back Jenny's parents.

936
01:24:27,006 --> 01:24:29,337
But, if I can bring back
her sight, perhaps...

937
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:31,620
my guilt will be a little less.

938
01:24:32,058 --> 01:24:34,248
And about having
broken arms and legs...

939
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:37,105
I am a cripple now, brother.

940
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:41,301
Your love has finally
gotten in the way!

941
01:24:44,226 --> 01:24:46,119
Actually, love has saved me, Omi!

942
01:24:55,178 --> 01:24:57,008
Take care of yourself.

943
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:12,866
Can I say something, Suraj?

944
01:25:17,595 --> 01:25:19,641
When the bandage
on my eyes is opened...

945
01:25:21,271 --> 01:25:23,395
don't come in front
of me immediately.

946
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:33,760
I don't want to suddenly come face to
face with the biggest joy in my life.

947
01:25:45,916 --> 01:25:47,313
And I also want...

948
01:25:48,704 --> 01:25:52,784
that you should be with me
when my sight is restored.

949
01:25:57,814 --> 01:25:59,531
Will you be there, Suraj?

950
01:26:00,806 --> 01:26:01,984
Promise me!

951
01:26:03,898 --> 01:26:05,746
What are you thinking? Promise!

952
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:48,845
Sarfaraz Ahmed...

953
01:26:50,142 --> 01:26:51,352
your new name...

954
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:53,750
Need another ID, the passport.

955
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:58,585
Your new phone with new sim card.

956
01:27:00,332 --> 01:27:01,398
'Foreign language.'

957
01:27:34,013 --> 01:27:35,912
Cheating with me...

958
01:27:42,034 --> 01:27:44,038
Normally I don't like
to dirty my hands.

959
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:45,712
But I know when I have to.

960
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,517
Now won't you say,
that's why you came.

961
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:54,683
To die.

962
01:27:57,603 --> 01:27:59,094
I hope you remember that.

963
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,069
Take him away!
Get him ready for the fight.

964
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,646
7 minutes!

965
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:57,008
You have 7 minutes to die.

966
01:28:59,413 --> 01:29:02,639
What to do? The rules of
the game are like this.

967
01:29:04,336 --> 01:29:07,457
This fight does not stop until
either man's breath's stops.

968
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:11,027
And your breath is
mortgaged with me.

969
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,626
From now on each breath of
yours will dance to my tunes.

970
01:29:16,152 --> 01:29:17,355
7 minutes!

971
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,568
You will make this game
interesting for 7 minutes.

972
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,117
And then you can
prepare to lose.

973
01:29:25,373 --> 01:29:27,520
That means, get ready to die!

974
01:29:29,454 --> 01:29:33,031
But you are a very lucky man, Suraj.

975
01:29:34,597 --> 01:29:37,313
Because, your fight
is not with an enemy.

976
01:29:37,621 --> 01:29:39,489
But, with your best friend.

977
01:29:40,364 --> 01:29:41,733
So cheer up, come on!

978
01:29:49,804 --> 01:29:50,973
Soup for you.

979
01:29:53,616 --> 01:29:54,838
Did Suraj call?

980
01:29:55,779 --> 01:29:56,403
No.

981
01:29:57,697 --> 01:30:00,488
Nurse, please check again.
He must have surely called!

982
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,297
Hit me.

983
01:30:52,232 --> 01:30:53,699
Come on, hit me man.

984
01:33:06,257 --> 01:33:09,438
'For 7 minutes you will
make this game interesting.'

985
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:11,504
'And then you can prepare to lose.'

986
01:33:14,867 --> 01:33:16,225
'Get ready to die!'

987
01:33:30,801 --> 01:33:32,753
What an amazing girl she must be...

988
01:33:32,947 --> 01:33:35,400
if you're ready to
give your life for her.

989
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:41,456
Your sacrifice and
her youth won't go in vain.

990
01:33:43,269 --> 01:33:45,330
I will take care of her.

991
01:33:45,794 --> 01:33:46,556
Yes!

992
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,434
Yes!

993
01:35:01,418 --> 01:35:02,196
Wait!

994
01:35:07,659 --> 01:35:09,561
He came here to die anyway.

995
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:12,549
But, our loss will not be fulfilled...

996
01:35:12,951 --> 01:35:14,950
by his death his life will do it.

997
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:24,663
And this time you better do it right!

998
01:35:33,445 --> 01:35:36,292
'I give you one more
chance to live your life.'

999
01:35:37,682 --> 01:35:40,844
'And if my goods do not reach intact.'

1000
01:35:42,057 --> 01:35:44,730
'Be ready to lose
your life this time.'

1001
01:37:53,071 --> 01:37:54,782
- Suraj?
- No!

1002
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:03,158
Take care.

1003
01:40:01,135 --> 01:40:06,368
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1004
01:40:07,431 --> 01:40:12,608
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1005
01:40:14,192 --> 01:40:20,168
"My eyes are brimming
over crying and dying for you"

1006
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:26,791
"My eyes are brimming
over crying and dying for you"

1007
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:31,842
"They have forgotten
the ways of life"

1008
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:37,538
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1009
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:43,687
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1010
01:40:58,579 --> 01:41:04,405
"I am all alone in
this crowded world"

1011
01:41:04,895 --> 01:41:10,655
"I have lost myself,
having lost you after finding you"

1012
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:17,250
"I am all alone in
this crowded world"

1013
01:41:17,496 --> 01:41:23,089
"I have lost myself,
having lost you after finding you"

1014
01:41:23,594 --> 01:41:29,419
"These days are as
dark as kohl without you"

1015
01:41:29,933 --> 01:41:35,829
"Even the stars are
dim during the night"

1016
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,894
- I have reached.
- Sample?

1017
01:42:10,554 --> 01:42:11,393
It's safe.

1018
01:42:11,753 --> 01:42:12,735
Where should I come?

1019
01:42:14,444 --> 01:42:15,860
I have very little time.

1020
01:42:17,213 --> 01:42:20,028
You don't have to come now,
Suraj, you have to go.

1021
01:42:20,547 --> 01:42:23,173
Because,
you really have very little time.

1022
01:43:10,136 --> 01:43:11,830
Excuse me, Dr. Aakash?

1023
01:43:12,192 --> 01:43:12,823
Nurse!

1024
01:43:13,628 --> 01:43:14,275
Suraj?

1025
01:43:14,353 --> 01:43:15,789
He came for my eye surgery.

1026
01:43:16,354 --> 01:43:17,356
You must be remembering him.

1027
01:43:17,434 --> 01:43:19,270
Can we get something
for her from CCTV?

1028
01:43:19,394 --> 01:43:21,031
We have the CCTV footage.

1029
01:43:21,262 --> 01:43:22,964
But it's only for 3 days.

1030
01:43:23,042 --> 01:43:25,406
I'm sure you'll be able
to organize it. Please, doctor.

1031
01:43:25,519 --> 01:43:27,001
- It's really important for me.
- I'm so sorry.

1032
01:43:34,985 --> 01:43:40,949
"My eyes have turned to stone,
looking at the roads and waiting"

1033
01:43:41,281 --> 01:43:47,112
"How did pain come
to the lips of happiness?"

1034
01:43:47,551 --> 01:43:53,715
"My eyes have turned to stone,
looking at the roads and waiting"

1035
01:43:53,934 --> 01:43:59,638
"How did pain come
to the lips of happiness?"

1036
01:44:00,039 --> 01:44:06,114
"My dreams sulk, our hearts
joined and then my heart has broken"

1037
01:44:06,322 --> 01:44:11,597
"Even the destiny lines
on my palms have broken!"

1038
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:17,168
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1039
01:44:18,567 --> 01:44:23,539
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1040
01:44:51,094 --> 01:44:52,603
Hi! May I help you?

1041
01:44:52,857 --> 01:44:54,190
Hi! I'm Kabir.

1042
01:44:54,818 --> 01:44:57,827
I have heard a lot about
you and your creative soldiers.

1043
01:44:58,472 --> 01:45:02,716
I have to admit your designs
are just as beautiful as you.

1044
01:45:03,401 --> 01:45:06,414
Thank you, but this work is
done by the children of the institute.

1045
01:45:06,751 --> 01:45:08,493
- Come inside.
- Someone's trying to be modest.

1046
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:10,922
You are the one teaching these kids.

1047
01:45:11,414 --> 01:45:13,725
Anyway, I own a fitness club.

1048
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:17,735
I need some gifts for my staff
for New Year's. Is it possible?

1049
01:45:17,813 --> 01:45:19,436
Yes! Absolutely!

1050
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,183
Do you just want to
go through the brochure?

1051
01:45:23,419 --> 01:45:26,060
When I see you so happy,
I am sure of one thing.

1052
01:45:26,323 --> 01:45:26,966
What?

1053
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:29,031
That you are not married!

1054
01:45:30,286 --> 01:45:31,023
Sorry!

1055
01:45:31,154 --> 01:45:33,449
But, I am married
and very happy.

1056
01:45:33,689 --> 01:45:35,044
Anyway, friends?

1057
01:45:35,718 --> 01:45:36,520
Friends!

1058
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,226
Excuse me.

1059
01:45:40,508 --> 01:45:41,127
Hello!

1060
01:45:42,477 --> 01:45:43,561
Yes, Dr. Kidwai.

1061
01:45:44,313 --> 01:45:46,904
No, I'm much better now.
Thank you, I'm fine.

1062
01:45:47,186 --> 01:45:48,387
Yes, it's been really long.

1063
01:45:48,547 --> 01:45:50,172
I'll see you this weekend for sure.

1064
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:51,661
- Hello Jenny!
- Hi!

1065
01:45:51,737 --> 01:45:54,014
- I haven't seen you for long.
- Been busy.

1066
01:45:56,407 --> 01:45:58,415
Dadu... how are you?

1067
01:45:59,106 --> 01:46:00,527
'Foreign language.'

1068
01:46:00,877 --> 01:46:01,363
Yeah.

1069
01:46:01,441 --> 01:46:04,157
My ankle pain still not recovered...

1070
01:46:04,235 --> 01:46:05,442
Okay, let me check.

1071
01:46:07,114 --> 01:46:09,438
Paining? Don't worry,
I'm here now.

1072
01:46:09,514 --> 01:46:11,286
I'll be coming every weekend.
Okay?

1073
01:46:11,446 --> 01:46:12,853
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.

1074
01:46:14,054 --> 01:46:15,033
And who's here?

1075
01:46:19,637 --> 01:46:20,647
Hello!

1076
01:46:21,513 --> 01:46:23,172
You're Indian, Pakistani or Malay?

1077
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:26,511
Indian!

1078
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:27,853
Okay!

1079
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:29,932
Hi! I'm Jenny.

1080
01:46:32,932 --> 01:46:34,242
Won't you say something?

1081
01:46:35,492 --> 01:46:37,282
He has not spoken...

1082
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,136
one word until now.

1083
01:46:39,291 --> 01:46:41,672
Okay! Let's see your case.

1084
01:46:47,655 --> 01:46:48,888
Muscle Spasm.

1085
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:52,411
The recommended treatment...

1086
01:46:52,617 --> 01:46:55,660
for your case is a massage.
Let me check.

1087
01:47:03,402 --> 01:47:05,371
Your leg muscles are pretty weak.

1088
01:47:05,677 --> 01:47:08,283
It looks like you've been
in a very big accident.

1089
01:47:08,650 --> 01:47:10,758
Let me see, if you need
traction for your back.

1090
01:47:17,525 --> 01:47:18,542
May, I turn you?

1091
01:47:23,183 --> 01:47:24,236
Easy. Easy.

1092
01:47:26,171 --> 01:47:27,000
Okay.

1093
01:47:31,971 --> 01:47:34,392
Your back muscles
have deteriorated!

1094
01:47:46,505 --> 01:47:48,282
Sarfaraz Ahmad.

1095
01:47:58,355 --> 01:48:00,780
But don't worry,
you'll be fine.

1096
01:48:01,373 --> 01:48:03,924
You'll be back running around,
like you were earlier.

1097
01:48:05,168 --> 01:48:07,546
Actually you know,
I am not a doctor.

1098
01:48:08,029 --> 01:48:09,973
But, I have learnt
physiotherapy.

1099
01:48:10,937 --> 01:48:12,503
If destiny had been with me...

1100
01:48:13,234 --> 01:48:15,808
I would have had a physiotherapy
centre of my own.

1101
01:48:17,246 --> 01:48:20,604
Anyways, I'll be coming
every weekend.

1102
01:48:20,812 --> 01:48:22,708
And this is my card.

1103
01:48:23,232 --> 01:48:25,641
So call me,
if you need me earlier.

1104
01:48:26,052 --> 01:48:26,767
Take care.

1105
01:48:26,844 --> 01:48:28,499
Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

1106
01:48:40,122 --> 01:48:40,967
Bye!

1107
01:48:49,186 --> 01:48:57,853
"So much uncertainty"

1108
01:48:59,037 --> 01:49:07,619
"So much loneliness"

1109
01:49:12,957 --> 01:49:17,491
"Your stubbornness
twirls in my words"

1110
01:49:17,806 --> 01:49:22,192
"I have sunk in the perfume
of your breath"

1111
01:49:22,702 --> 01:49:27,140
"I have not been
released from love"

1112
01:49:27,614 --> 01:49:31,725
"I found the highs of heaven
in your shelter"

1113
01:49:32,064 --> 01:49:40,817
"You are the beauty of this world"

1114
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:50,528
"You are the beauty of this world"

1115
01:50:05,252 --> 01:50:06,176
Thank you.

1116
01:50:06,441 --> 01:50:09,321
I will have your order delivered
to you by tomorrow. Okay.

1117
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,161
Great. Pleasure working with you.

1118
01:50:11,285 --> 01:50:12,304
With you as well.

1119
01:50:13,993 --> 01:50:15,848
Excuse me.
Can you do me a favor?

1120
01:50:15,988 --> 01:50:18,266
There are no favors
in friendship, just order.

1121
01:50:18,342 --> 01:50:20,720
I'm getting late. Will you just take
care of my shop for 5 minutes?

1122
01:50:20,797 --> 01:50:22,210
- Sure!
- I'll just go across and get some...

1123
01:50:22,286 --> 01:50:23,037
medicines for Romeo.

1124
01:50:23,113 --> 01:50:23,954
Romeo?

1125
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:25,403
My turtle.

1126
01:50:27,026 --> 01:50:30,623
Romeo, Romeo! If only my parents
had given me such a lovely name.

1127
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:33,363
- Then, you would have crawled, too!
- I'd do what you wanted me to.

1128
01:50:36,585 --> 01:50:37,690
How stupid!

1129
01:50:44,323 --> 01:50:45,764
Come on, Oscar.

1130
01:50:46,109 --> 01:50:48,007
Let's go baby, come.

1131
01:50:59,676 --> 01:51:01,026
May I help you?

1132
01:51:03,594 --> 01:51:05,415
Are you looking out for something?

1133
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:12,845
Night Jasmine.
It only blooms at night.

1134
01:51:13,138 --> 01:51:15,398
It's available only at
our shop in this whole area.

1135
01:51:20,188 --> 01:51:21,124
Storm?

1136
01:51:23,605 --> 01:51:24,795
Should I pack it?

1137
01:51:29,424 --> 01:51:30,562
I'll just pack it for you.

1138
01:52:02,298 --> 01:52:05,215
Oscar, wait! Oscar!

1139
01:52:18,067 --> 01:52:18,950
Oscar!

1140
01:52:20,196 --> 01:52:21,312
What are you doing?

1141
01:52:21,577 --> 01:52:22,925
Behave yourself. I am sorry.

1142
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:24,981
Really, sorry. He normally
doesn't behave like this.

1143
01:52:25,059 --> 01:52:27,237
I don't know what happened to
him! Oscar, come on!

1144
01:52:27,464 --> 01:52:28,495
May I help you?

1145
01:52:29,102 --> 01:52:29,687
Yeah!

1146
01:52:31,297 --> 01:52:32,333
Are you okay?

1147
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:43,347
You are?

1148
01:52:44,737 --> 01:52:47,670
Aren't you the same man,
that patient from the hospital?

1149
01:52:50,499 --> 01:52:51,698
Should I drop you somewhere?

1150
01:52:52,228 --> 01:52:56,581
"You are my winters and
I am like the sun"

1151
01:52:57,129 --> 01:53:01,515
"I find peace in your arms"

1152
01:53:02,008 --> 01:53:06,467
"Love is like a musical instrument"

1153
01:53:06,914 --> 01:53:10,831
"I found bliss in your shelter"

1154
01:53:11,163 --> 01:53:15,558
"I found you, found you!"

1155
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:20,035
"You are beauty of this world"

1156
01:53:20,845 --> 01:53:24,867
"I found you, found you!"

1157
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:29,785
"You are beauty of this world"

1158
01:53:32,923 --> 01:53:34,011
Sit!

1159
01:53:34,758 --> 01:53:35,730
Sit!

1160
01:53:46,745 --> 01:53:48,244
You're back so soon.

1161
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:51,162
Here, I have earned 50 ringgits
for you in 5 minutes.

1162
01:53:51,238 --> 01:53:52,653
Not bad. One second.

1163
01:54:00,085 --> 01:54:01,349
Where's Romeo?

1164
01:54:02,172 --> 01:54:05,369
Did somebody come here?
The man with the crutch?

1165
01:54:05,502 --> 01:54:06,494
Yes!

1166
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:09,642
He was the one who
bought the night jasmine.

1167
01:54:09,806 --> 01:54:10,551
You know what?

1168
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:13,187
I almost mistook him as
one of my favorite boxers.

1169
01:54:13,285 --> 01:54:13,977
Storm!

1170
01:54:14,535 --> 01:54:15,963
But I felt it was him.

1171
01:54:16,237 --> 01:54:18,431
But, he didn't react when
I called him by that name.

1172
01:54:18,597 --> 01:54:20,471
You know what?
I'm sure it was him.

1173
01:54:20,951 --> 01:54:23,752
I was looking at him,
but he didn't hear me at all.

1174
01:54:26,482 --> 01:54:27,508
Silly boy!

1175
01:54:43,421 --> 01:54:44,408
Suraj!

1176
01:54:56,707 --> 01:54:57,616
Suraj!

1177
01:55:23,014 --> 01:55:23,924
Suraj!

1178
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:25,833
Suraj!

1179
01:56:35,046 --> 01:56:36,063
Hello!

1180
01:56:36,646 --> 01:56:37,853
Dr. Kidwai.

1181
01:56:38,011 --> 01:56:39,325
Hi! This is Jenny.

1182
01:56:40,107 --> 01:56:43,089
Doctor, I need to know about
that patient on bed number 13.

1183
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:45,480
Yes, Sarfaraz.

1184
01:56:46,883 --> 01:56:49,030
What happened?
What happened to Sarfaraz?

1185
01:56:51,455 --> 01:56:52,437
What?

1186
01:56:52,926 --> 01:56:54,781
He left yesterday?

1187
01:57:40,593 --> 01:57:41,546
Suraj!

1188
01:57:47,518 --> 01:57:50,153
You done so much
for me quietly.

1189
01:57:51,501 --> 01:57:53,210
Now, when it's my turn...

1190
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:57,702
you let go of my hand
and were going away.

1191
01:58:35,793 --> 01:58:37,748
It's all the fault of these eyes.

1192
01:58:40,252 --> 01:58:43,461
I could read a man
without my eyes, but...

1193
01:58:45,816 --> 01:58:50,300
I couldn't recognize him when
I could see him in front of me.

1194
01:58:56,208 --> 01:58:57,031
Why?

1195
01:58:58,049 --> 01:58:59,985
Why did you do this to me?

1196
01:59:01,298 --> 01:59:02,085
Why?

1197
01:59:02,403 --> 01:59:04,122
Because, I'm silly and ugly.

1198
01:59:19,517 --> 01:59:21,379
Jignesh is so much better than you...

1199
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:27,064
he never troubled his
Bindiya as much as this.
