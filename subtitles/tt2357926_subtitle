1
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,830
Hello.
Okay, sir. Okay.

2
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,880
Raghuveer, you're still awake.

3
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,501
Surprisingly, for the first time in seven years

4
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,790
I am seeing you smile.

5
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,420
You will be released tomorrow.

6
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,920
That's why you are happy, right?

7
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,920
I'll be seeing my sister after a long time.

8
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,250
I can't explain how happy I am.

9
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,040
You really love your sister, don't you?
- Yes!

10
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,500
In all these years, you never met your family.

11
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,460
Neither did you speak to anyone.

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,130
You're a good man.
How did you land up here?

13
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,830
I have spent seven years in this jail.

14
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,130
But my story dates back even longer.

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,630
I was just 11 years old.

16
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,080
I was visiting the temple with
my mom and my younger sister.

17
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,290
He's my son Raghuveer and she's my daughter Sona.

18
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,040
Please make an offering in their names, priest.

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,500
Sure, dear.

20
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,250
Mom, you promised to take me to my dad.

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,170
That's where we're going, son.
- Here's the offering.

22
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,170
Won't you offer the coconut, dear?

23
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,210
I completely forgot, priest.
- Do it now.

24
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,960
My mom used to say

25
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,460
that a rotten coconut brings bad luck.

26
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,130
And that's exactly what happened.

27
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,250
My dad had married someone else.

28
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,330
He humiliated my mom.
- Get out of here!

29
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,460
And broke all ties with us.

30
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,330
My mom couldn't take this betrayal.

31
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,750
She was completely shattered.

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,040
She kept weeping the entire day, hugging us.

33
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,420
And left us forever.

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,670
Mom.
Mom.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,040
Mom!

36
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,040
What happened?
Who is she?

37
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,250
She's my mom.

38
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,380
She's dead.
- Dead!

39
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,130
Here you go, priest.
- Bless you.

40
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,960
Stop!

41
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Who built this tomb here?

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,330
This field belongs to them.
Why are you bothered?

43
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,960
I own this field.

44
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,960
His mom had taken a loan from me.

45
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,080
So, the council has decided that I can seize this field.

46
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,040
Get rid of this tomb, now!
- I'll repay your debt.

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,880
Don't break my mom's tomb.

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,210
He says he will repay your debt.

49
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,750
Give him a chance.

50
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,290
At first, his dad eloped.
Then his mom died.

51
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,960
He's still a kid.
How will he repay my debt?

52
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,000
He'll plough the field and pay you back.
- Him?

53
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll toil day and night.
And repay your entire debt.

54
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,880
Otherwise, I will repay your debt.

55
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,170
Fine. Every year the involvement
should reach me on time.

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,790
Its installment, not involvement.

57
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,330
Whatever.
Let's go.

58
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,420
Sir!

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,960
Don't cry, Sona.

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,580
Mom used to say, that star is you and that's me.

61
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,540
Come on.

62
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,580
Don't worry, Raghu.

63
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,830
Your sister's going to top her exams.

64
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,210
Break the coconut.

65
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,080
Wow!
There's a flower inside.

66
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,080
She's definitely going to excel now.

67
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,170
Sona.

68
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,670
Sona. Your books.
- Hey! Be careful.

69
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,790
You know that she'll drop them if you interrupt her.

70
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Gauri, it's my exam today, I won't need them.

71
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,580
Take them along, Sona.

72
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,130
You can score better if you copy.

73
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,330
You're too much.
- Is it?

74
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Let's go.

75
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,670
You remember everything, right?
- Yes.

76
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,823
Concentrate on your studies.
And do well in your exams.

77
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,290
Yes.
- Why don't you go with her?

78
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,540
Why?
- How many times will you tell her...

79
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,630
Do good, do good.

80
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,040
Hey! A hottie just boarded the previous bogie.

81
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,250
Sona has always done well...

82
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,130
Where did he go?

83
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,330
"You've cast a spell on me."

84
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,040
"My heart's fallen for you."

85
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,210
"You've cast a spell on me."

86
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,960
"Baby, I love you."
- Come on.

87
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,210
"Baby, I love you.
Baby, I love you."

88
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,790
"Baby, I.."

89
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,080
Nice song.
You sound good too.

90
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,290
But teasing girls is wrong.
- What did he say?

91
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,540
Wrong!

92
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,630
Who are you to interfere?
Move!

93
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,920
See that!
I'll stab you with this.

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,130
What the...

95
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,830
Check and mate.

96
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,830
Someday, I'll definitely beat you.

97
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,080
I'm also waiting for that day.
- Hello, sir.

98
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,540
I heard that your sister's taking her college exams.

99
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,130
Yes.

100
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,420
She's a pretty intelligent and smart girl.

101
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,580
Sona.
- Not again, brother.

102
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,710
Sona, you see those stars in the sky...

103
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,750
That one's me and the other one's you.

104
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,710
Mom used to say that, right?

105
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,040
That means, after Sona's marriage

106
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,790
one of the stars will disappear.

107
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,830
Mind your own business.
And...

108
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,580
Brother, shall I take the eggs to the market tomorrow?

109
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,830
Yes.
But be careful.

110
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,960
I didn't say that to her.

111
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,290
You keep dropping stuff.

112
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,790
It happened only twice today.

113
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,580
Hello!

114
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,710
Priest, what brings you here at this hour?

115
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,580
After a long search

116
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,670
I've found a suitable match for Sona.

117
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,790
He has a big post in a big American company.

118
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,460
Then, he'll definitely take his bride abroad.

119
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,380
Of course, in a big airplane...

120
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,460
This offer's too big for us.

121
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,630
I don't accept it.

122
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,290
Anyone else would've pounced on this opportunity.

123
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,170
I don't want a prince for my sister.

124
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,540
Then?

125
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,630
I want a boy who can stay here and look after her.

126
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,920
"He's like a loom in the sea."

127
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,670
"Music is what we make.."

128
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,290
"That's right, feel that.."

129
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,540
"That's right"

130
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,460
"feel that.."

131
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,460
"That's right"

132
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,500
"feel that.."

133
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,040
"My heart goes.."

134
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,420
"My heart goes.."

135
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,330
"My heart goes.."

136
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,710
Ram! Where are you?
- On the beach.

137
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,380
On the beach, with the girls?

138
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,210
All by yourself.
You didn't invite me.

139
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,670
You've become selfish.
- Hello.

140
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,420
Hello.
- Hello.

141
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,290
That's my trick.

142
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,170
This is what I do when your mom scolds me.

143
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,580
Hello. I can't hear you.
- Okay.

144
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,250
Enjoy yourself. Have fun.
- Thanks, dad.

145
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,580
Wow!
He heard this though.

146
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,130
I heard that you made a donation

147
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,670
to the Royal Australian Orphanage.

148
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,420
It's a petty amount.
10,000 Dollars.

149
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,420
You call that a petty amount.

150
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,880
You could've spent that money for PR activities.

151
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,580
Or thrown a party for your business colleagues.

152
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,670
Think about the profits.
- We anyway throw parties.

153
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,920
Stop wasting money on useless things.

154
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,630
You know that I don't like it.

155
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,500
Hi, dad!

156
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,040
Bad mood?
Tell me.

157
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,130
I'm your best friend.
Did mom yell at you again?

158
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,670
Thank you very much.
- Why?

159
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,380
For not asking whether she beat me up or not.

160
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,670
You know how she is.

161
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,330
Then, why the long face?
- I'm not upset.

162
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,080
Do you know why the world's
greatest philosopher was happy?

163
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,710
Because he knew how to tolerate his tyrannical wife.

164
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,960
He...

165
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,540
Angry bird!

166
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,880
Hello.
It wasn't about you.

167
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,540
I was talking about Socrates' wife.

168
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,880
Hello, brother-in-law.
Krishnakant speaking.

169
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,920
How are you?

170
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,250
Trying to get along with your sister.

171
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,170
What's new in that?

172
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,920
It's your brother from India.

173
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,250
Hello. Yes, brother.
- Sister. How are you?

174
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,290
How are you?
- Everything is good.

175
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,710
So what's new?

176
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,080
Too many things, but the biggest news is

177
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,380
Riya's getting engaged on the 14th of this month.

178
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,960
So soon!

179
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,210
Was she in love?
- Exactly.

180
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,000
I objected but she cried, so I had to agree.

181
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,790
But is the boy from a good family?

182
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,880
I mean, are they rich?
- That's exactly why I agreed.

183
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,540
Listen.
Reach here as soon as you can.

184
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,790
Because you have to handle the arrangements.

185
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,330
Don't forget to tell brother-in-law and...

186
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,790
Hello, aunt.
- Yes, dear.

187
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,210
Riya speaking.
- Congratulations. How are you?

188
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,880
Fine, aunt, Bring Ram along too.
- Ram?

189
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,750
We haven't met since our childhood.

190
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,290
Sure, dear.
Bye.

191
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,420
Ram.
- Yes, mom.

192
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,960
Ram.
We're going to India.

193
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,130
India!

194
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,380
India!
- You aren't going.

195
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,670
Why?
- You have to attend a conference in the US.

196
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,130
Don't you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

197
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,080
America, yo!

198
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,580
Stop!

199
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,880
Mr. Raghuveer.

200
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,630
Riya, how are you?

201
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,330
A chocolate for you.

202
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,460
You never forget to get me chocolates, do you?

203
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,500
Welcome the bride.
- Bride?

204
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
When are you getting married?

205
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,580
Next Friday...
That's just 15 days.

206
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,710
And you are both invited.
- Of course.

207
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,330
We'll reach there two days in advance.

208
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,460
Just two days?

209
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,710
I have come here to take Sona right now.

210
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,460
Now?
- Of course.

211
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,113
Sona, when would you expect me to come over

212
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,710
for your wedding?
- I don't know, ask brother.

213
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,170
Sir!

214
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,580
How many days before

215
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,540
do you expect me to come for Sona's wedding?

216
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,500
At least 15 days.
- Right.

217
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,880
My wedding is just 15 days later.

218
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,880
I'm just like your sister.
Please send her along.

219
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,670
Please...
Please.

220
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,460
Actually, I have never sent her alone anywhere.

221
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,210
She has also never stayed away from you.

222
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,080
But you will have to send her along.

223
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,920
Please...
Please. Please. Please.

224
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,540
Do you want to go, Sona?

225
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,710
I won't, if you refuse.

226
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,540
Go on.

227
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,500
Be careful!

228
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,040
Let's go!

229
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,750
"My heart searches everywhere."

230
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,580
"Confuses me as it goes."

231
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,080
"My heart searches everywhere."

232
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,080
"Confuses me as it goes."

233
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,460
"Makes gestures all the time."

234
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,710
"Makes me stagger."

235
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
"Gets upset."

236
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,080
"Makes excuses."

237
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,920
"I wish someone steals it away."

238
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,880
"So, I'm rid of it.
- Oh, Lord."

239
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,130
"I wish someone steals it away."

240
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:47,630
"So, I'm rid of it.
- Oh, Lord."

241
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,580
Hey, my coconut! Give me my money.
- Bye!

242
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,670
Hey! Hi, I'm Ram.
What's up, beautiful?

243
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,540
May I know your name please?
- Paro.

244
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,540
Hi!
- Dad, mom!

245
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,420
"It's aware, naive.
Never listens to me."

246
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,540
"I keep thinking all the time.
But it never understands."

247
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,670
"It's aware, naive.
Never listens to me."

248
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,080
"I keep thinking all the time.
But it never understands."

249
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,000
"It's always lost in a different world."

250
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,080
"Makes excuses."

251
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,920
"I wish someone steals it away."

252
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,040
"So, I'm rid of it.
- Oh, Lord."

253
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,170
"I wish someone steals it away."

254
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,880
"So, I'm rid of it."

255
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,920
"So, I'm rid of it."

256
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,210
"It has unsure intensions."

257
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,290
"Simple wishes and fragile dreams."

258
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,290
"It has unsure intensions."

259
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,670
"Simple wishes and fragile dreams."

260
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,750
"It always weaves new dreams."

261
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,790
"Makes excuses."

262
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,580
"I wish someone steals it away."
- Dad!

263
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:34,630
"So, I'm rid of it.
- Oh, Lord."

264
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,880
"I wish someone steals it away."

265
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,170
"So, I'm rid of it.
- Oh, Lord."

266
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,080
"I wish someone steals it away."

267
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,500
"So, I'm rid of it."

268
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,500
"So, I'm rid of it."

269
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,670
"So, I'm rid of it."

270
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,330
"So, I'm rid of it."

271
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,460
"I wish someone steals it away."

272
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,330
"So, I'm rid of it."
- Ram!

273
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,880
Look, what a big bouquet I've brought for you.

274
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,380
I.. I am Bijli.

275
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,750
Bijli!

276
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,920
Nephew.
Nephew.

277
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,250
Uncle.
- My dear!

278
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,710
Put your leg down.

279
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,880
That's enough.

280
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,500
He's naughty!

281
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,580
Who is this beauty and the beast?

282
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,420
She's my distant relative.

283
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,130
She too.
- And I'm a close one.

284
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
You...

285
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,250
Why aren't you saying anything?

286
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,080
Does even a vegetable vendor
in Australia speak in English?

287
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,040
It's okay.
Don't say a word.

288
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,960
A policeman, maid, fruit-seller, janitor...

289
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,460
Does everyone speak in English?

290
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,750
What's your problem?
- I am constipated.

291
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,130
So, why are you telling me?

292
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,250
You just asked, what my problem is.

293
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,830
Bijli. Who's that?
- Riya.

294
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,630
Riya!

295
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,920
I'm not Riya.
- Why?

296
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,420
I'm Riya's friend.

297
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,250
Why didn't you say that earlier?

298
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,210
It's okay.
Mistakes are common at this age.

299
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,750
No need to apologize.

300
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,540
Oh! Anklet.

301
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,750
Ram.

302
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,330
Riya!

303
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,080
How are you?
- Fine. Please.

304
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,500
She's...
- I know, she's your friend.

305
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,500
I mistook her for you and hugged her like this...

306
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,460
Riya!
- What are you doing?

307
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,880
She doesn't like all this.

308
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,420
So, what does she like?
- Riya, where are you?

309
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,830
Coming.

310
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,250
Come on, Ram.
Come on.

311
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,420
Not Ram!
Rather, a monkey.

312
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,960
So, what's your name?
I know you won't tell me.

313
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,880
My name's Ram.
I'm from Australia.

314
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,040
People say that boys who come from abroad

315
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,830
are spoilt, manner less, crooks and conmen.

316
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,630
They're right.
I am exactly like that.

317
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,790
So, beware.

318
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,380
Where's the sugar?
- Sugar...

319
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,080
Sugar...
What happened?

320
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,210
Why are you so scared?
- I thought, that monkey's back.

321
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,210
Who?
- The one who has come from Australia.

322
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,630
He was raised in Australia.

323
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,880
Not every foreigner is so spoilt.

324
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,130
It's not his fault, it's his parents'.

325
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,130
They raised him like this.

326
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,210
If I ever meet his parents

327
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
I will question them face-to-face.

328
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,210
Right, ma'am?

329
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,460
Do you know who you are talking to?

330
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,130
Riya's aunt.

331
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,080
That Australian monkey is her son.
- Is it?

332
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,290
"Hold.."

333
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,580
Need some sugar.

334
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,330
That's better.

335
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,290
"Everyone lacks a little sweetness.."

336
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,250
Let's go.

337
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,420
Welcome!

338
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,000
How are you, dear?
- Fine.

339
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,080
Hello, ma'am.

340
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,080
Hello.
- He's my partner in the construction business.

341
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,170
I see.
- JP. Jai Prakash.

342
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,469
Yes. He was with the Central Ministry for 20 years.

343
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,380
Please don't...
- She's my sister Ashwini.

344
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,000
From Australia.
- Hello!

345
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,000
Ma'am.
- Is she the one with the son?

346
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,540
You promised that her son and my...
- Right, right.

347
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,830
Then introduce me to him.
- Let's go in first.

348
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,250
Come in.
- Let's go.

349
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,130
Please, come in.

350
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,330
Sona, look at this.
- Nice.

351
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,912
I have got the news from the kitchen

352
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,170
that you called me a monkey.
- No!

353
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,500
Australian monkey.
- Wow!

354
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,670
My mistake.
I should've called you a gorilla.

355
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,580
Riya!

356
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,420
There he is.

357
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,580
Get lost.

358
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,710
Hi. I'm Dolly.
- Hi!

359
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,580
Hi, I'm Bijli.

360
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,290
Bijli. Bijli.
- Whatever.

361
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,710
Come on. Let's dance.
- Sure.

362
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,330
Everyone in India wears saris and salwar suits.

363
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,790
And it's so colorful.

364
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,380
Okay, dad. Take care.
Got to go.

365
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,830
What are you doing in my room?

366
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,710
This is my room.
Get out!

367
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,790
Sorry. My mistake.

368
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,170
Did you see anything?
- No, I...

369
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,790
Just get out.
- Thank God!

370
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,710
Nice horse.
Don't touch that.

371
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,960
My brother gifted me that.
Please!

372
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,580
Did your brother give it to you?

373
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,210
Get out of here!
- Okay.

374
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,130
I have a doubt.
I troubled you so much.

375
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,580
Any other girl would've slapped me.

376
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,920
But you didn't.
Does that mean...

377
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,790
Something-something.
- What?

378
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,250
Something-something.
- Nothing.

379
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,170
"Touch me.. Touch me.
Hold me.. Hold me.."

380
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,380
Ram. You're nude.
- Now, you're nude.

381
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,210
I didn't know, I could have that effect on women.

382
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,330
"Touch me.. Touch me."

383
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,630
Let's begin.
- Where's Ram?

384
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,460
Must be around.

385
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,210
Dear. Ram.
Ram.

386
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,290
Tell her to get close to Ram.

387
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,630
What's wrong?

388
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,080
Don't worry, she'll get too close for comfort.

389
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,630
"Let's see.."

390
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,580
"Who's got the strength."

391
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,210
"Keep a firm foot ahead."

392
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,960
"My friend."

393
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,420
This jacket belongs to that Australian monkey.

394
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,830
Riya!
Now I'll show you.

395
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,250
Mogambo's pleased!

396
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,960
I hate your name!

397
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,380
"Let's see.."

398
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,210
"Who's got the strength."
- Ram!

399
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,210
Have you seen Ram around?
- No.

400
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,880
But he isn't there.

401
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,290
Hi.
- Hi!

402
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,130
Hi, Dolly.
- You naughty boy.

403
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,580
So there you are.
- No. Here I am.

404
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,290
Okay, listen.

405
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,210
Don't make any plans for the evening.

406
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,750
My friends are coming over.
Okay?

407
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,960
Ram.
They're my friends.

408
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,830
Radhika. Rashmi.
- Hi!

409
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,250
Pooja and Aanchal.
- Hi!

410
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
These are my bermudas

411
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,710
my tee-shirt and those are my slippers.

412
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,290
Shut up and get back.

413
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,460
You keep working the entire day.

414
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,130
Come and sit here.

415
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,460
Wow!
- But I didn't make this.

416
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,830
That's why he liked it.
She's fuming.

417
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,130
So, who was I talking about?
- Ram. Ram!

418
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,040
Ram's dad is among the top 500 billionaires of Australia.

419
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,750
A big mansion.
100 acres of a plush estate.

420
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,330
And a private chartered plane.

421
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,630
You're not too far-off either, Dolly.

422
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,170
Of course.
My dad's a billionaire too.

423
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,420
Ministers come over for breakfast.
Actors for lunch.

424
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,040
And builders for evening snacks.
- Does your dad run a mess?

425
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,250
Don't mess with me.

426
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,750
So, Ram's a billionaire and so am I.

427
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,750
In fact, we all are rich.
We have everything.

428
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,330
But what about you?
- I'm rich too.

429
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,460
Really?
What do you have?

430
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,960
We have a small house back in the village.

431
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,170
10 acres of land. 20 bulls.

432
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,830
25 cows. 40 hens and 100 goats.

433
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,080
But I also have a brother

434
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,920
who loves me more than his life.

435
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,000
And his love is invaluable for me.

436
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,880
Sona. Let's go.
- Yes.

437
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,210
Bye, Ram!
- Bye, Sona.

438
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,250
What are you looking at?

439
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,580
Don't know how, but everyday I see something new in Sona.

440
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,330
But why?
- She's something.

441
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,290
Something-something.

442
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,040
Sona has finished her studies.

443
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,960
Get her married this year.

444
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,960
I will, if I find a good match.

445
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,670
Yes.

446
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,580
My son has done his graduation in agriculture.

447
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,080
We've been getting proposals from affluent families.

448
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,790
But... he wants to marry your sister.

449
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Do you have any objection?

450
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,130
Sona...
- Oh! You want to take her consent.

451
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,630
And I will have to consult sir too.

452
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,130
Yeah, right.

453
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,790
Why are you crying on such a happy occasion?

454
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,130
Soon my daughter will also get
married and leave for Australia.

455
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,630
What a positive mentality!

456
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,710
What are you doing?

457
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,670
I've already bought tickets to Australia.

458
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,380
Hello.
- Now, I'll read out the wedding invitation.

459
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,710
Mr. Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Riya.

460
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,830
Who is that?
- Mr. Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Riya.

461
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,380
Who is that?
- Mr. Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Riya.

462
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,960
Priest.
Please carry on.

463
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,710
Mr. Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Riya.

464
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,040
Stop this nonsense.

465
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,210
Why did you stop?
- He asked me to stop.

466
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,920
Please continue.
Continue. Continue.

467
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,630
Excuse me. Excuse me.

468
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,380
Hi!

469
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,880
When are you getting married?
- What?

470
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,540
I have a friend.

471
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,420
He has got 10 hens, 4 bulls and a mare.

472
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,290
He'll be a perfect match for you.
- Tea.

473
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,040
Bijli.
What's the time?

474
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,920
I don't have a watch.

475
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,080
You don't have a brain either.
- I know.

476
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,080
Let's go there.
- Yes, let's go.

477
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,880
Ma'am...

478
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,170
You have made this party come alive.
- Thank you.

479
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,540
You're the star of this party.

480
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,920
Why are you repeating the old lines?
Say something new.

481
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,130
That's very nice of you.

482
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,920
Only one thing is missing.
- What's that?

483
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,380
What's this?
- A small, petty necklace.

484
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,290
Looks pretty expensive though...
- It just cost Rs. 2.5 million.

485
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,380
You're trying to butter her up.

486
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,130
This wasn't required.
- It's okay.

487
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,580
Every time I see them together, I feel happy, ma'am.

488
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,250
I feel really content.
- But I feel like puking.

489
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,580
I can't stand it.

490
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,290
Hey...

491
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,250
Hi, guys...
- People call me Bijli Gaga...

492
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,210
Hey, everyone.
This is Ram. My boyfriend.

493
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,540
Hi!
- Come closer, Ram.

494
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,330
"Nothing's gonna change my love for you."

495
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,630
Get off me, you dirty pig.

496
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,960
"Pig loves you!
Pig loves you!"

497
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,250
Shiraz had said that.
- No, baby, it was Prabhu.

498
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,130
No, it was Mr. Kumar.

499
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,170
So, cuddling up!
- Spoilsport!

500
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,130
Wow!

501
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,040
Hi!

502
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,960
She's my best friend.

503
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,750
And she's Rinki and Jazz...
- Hi.

504
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,420
Ma'am, the buffet's ready.
- Okay.

505
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,580
You talk to them, I will be back.
Okay?

506
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,040
Nice party, isn't it?
- Yeah.

507
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,420
Why are you following me?
- My wish.

508
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,040
Come to the side.

509
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,960
Put some chicken pieces and...
- Go away.

510
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,080
What would people say?

511
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,460
That's why I am saying, come to the side.

512
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,080
I won't.

513
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,210
Your zip is open.
- You're lying.

514
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,210
You have a mole ten inches below your neck. Right?

515
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,960
"Stranger, don't leave me."

516
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,880
I told you...
- Your friend's calling you.

517
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,040
What happened?

518
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,710
It's stuck.
Come on.

519
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,080
Thanks.

520
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:28,080
What?
- You're a monkey, but a nice one.

521
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,630
What?
You praised me.

522
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,080
Not bad. Something?
- Nothing.

523
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,880
Something-something.
- Nothing-nothing.

524
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,420
Yes.

525
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,880
"You are my history.
You are my philosophy."

526
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,130
"Loveology."

527
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,420
"Listen to me."

528
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,710
"Come with me."

529
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,500
"Be my girl."

530
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,830
"Let the drums play."

531
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,750
"Come closer to me."

532
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,250
"Let the drums play.
Come closer to me."

533
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,750
"Listen to my heart."

534
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,460
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
- Extra!

535
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,130
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

536
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,460
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

537
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,920
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

538
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,330
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

539
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,250
"You're attitude.. Oh, baby."

540
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,830
"You're attitude.. Oh, baby."

541
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,170
"Get lost, go home.
Go to your mommy."

542
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:37,250
"Open your eyes.
Take me in your arms."

543
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,880
"Open your eyes.
Take me in your arms."

544
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,170
"Let me disappear in your arms."

545
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,880
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
- Extra!

546
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,540
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

547
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,920
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

548
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,380
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

549
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,670
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

550
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,540
"Oh, my.. Your moves are killer."

551
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,210
"Oh, my.. Your moves are killer."

552
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,710
"I won't spare you, don't mess with me."

553
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,330
"You're my soul.
You're precious."

554
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,170
"You're my soul.
You're precious."

555
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,670
"Don't leave me now."

556
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,290
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

557
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,380
"Baby.."

558
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

559
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,710
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."

560
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,500
Dance with me?

561
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,330
Wow! Something-something?

562
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,130
Something-something.

563
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,880
He was my friend in college.

564
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,830
He gave me champagne to drink on his birthday party.

565
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,630
I was slightly drunk.

566
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,380
He was shooting me.

567
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,670
And was also trying to kiss me.

568
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,670
Now he's trying to black-mail me

569
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,960
with that clip.

570
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,250
He has asked Riya for money and her jewelry.

571
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,170
Otherwise, he'll upload the clip on the internet.

572
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,130
That clip's on his iPad.

573
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,290
Is this what you meant by 'something-something'?

574
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,580
Only someone of our age can solve our problem.

575
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,000
I didn't know what to do.
That's why I talked to you.

576
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,750
Let's search.
- Yes.

577
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:03,920
That way.

578
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,630
What now?
- Watch me.

579
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,420
Brother!

580
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,670
Why didn't you close the door?
- Why didn't you do it?

581
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,580
Did you have to yell so loudly?

582
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,710
But I...
- Wait.

583
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,040
Pass me that bottle of shampoo.

584
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,420
Do you want to take a bath now?

585
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,880
What now?

586
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,960
Watch him run away.

587
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,960
He's dangerous.
- Get down. Get down.

588
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,460
Think about getting out of here.

589
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,290
Idea!
You go this way.

590
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,670
The dog will chase you.

591
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,670
And I'll escape from here with the iPad.

592
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,960
Was that a joke?
- No, I'm serious.

593
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,880
Then why don't you go out? Hey!
- Okay.

594
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,500
He'll bite you.
- I like it.

595
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,210
I totally like it.

596
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,880
Ma'am.
Take a seat.

597
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,880
Go ahead.
Keep it on my head.

598
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,380
Chill.

599
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,330
What now?
- Sing a song!

600
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:22,670
You like my voice so much!
- It will shoo away the dog.

601
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,290
"Who let the dogs out?"

602
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,420
"Who let the dogs out?"

603
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:34,580
"Who let the dogs out?"

604
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,080
"Who let the dogs out?"

605
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,830
"When the party was nice, the party was bumpin'.."

606
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,630
"And everybody havin' a ball."

607
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,420
"Until the fellas start the name callin.."

608
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,500
Turn it off.

609
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,290
Turn it off.

610
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,540
It's my phone.

611
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,710
Hey, Lisa.
I'm in the bathroom taking a shower.

612
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,380
Call you later.

613
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,830
She's my girlfriend.
- I didn't ask.

614
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,750
I thought you might.

615
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,130
Doesn't make a difference to me.

616
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,830
By the way, how many girlfriends do you have?

617
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:45,630
14! Including you.

618
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,290
I am not your girlfriend!
- Girls always say the opposite.

619
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,790
I mean, I am.
- That's what I said.

620
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,420
But I...
- Oh, come on.

621
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,540
There were other boys and girls at the party too.

622
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,040
But you asked for my help.
Why?

623
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,210
Because you consider me a friend.

624
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,290
Girl, friend. Girlfriend.

625
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,960
Fine.
But not the other type.

626
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,500
Everyone has friends.

627
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,250
But only one special someone makes a place in their heart.

628
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,540
I do have someone, you must have one too.

629
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,330
Who is he?

630
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,420
Look...
- Where?

631
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:31,960
The shower has turned off.
- Great discovery.

632
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,460
Think of a way to get out.

633
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,130
Google. Google.

634
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,420
Idea number two.
- What?

635
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,580
I'll tease the dog.

636
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,750
The dog will get in from here

637
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,191
and we'll get out from the other side.

638
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,880
Why didn't you think of this earlier?

639
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,710
So that I could say it now.

640
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,420
Go, go...
Let's go, Sona.

641
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,880
Let's go, let's go.

642
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,500
Let's go.
Come on. He's gone.

643
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,040
Come on.

644
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,540
Brother!

645
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,080
Give me my iPad back.
Or else I will shoot.

646
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,880
Shoot me.
- No. You shouldn't shoot girls.

647
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,500
Shoot me.
- No. Shoot me.

648
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,830
The gun's empty.
- But I still have the gun.

649
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,210
Rascal, how dare you blackmail girls?

650
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,670
What happened?

651
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,290
Sorry, Riya.
- Oh, my God!

652
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,580
Why are you bothering her?
Come on.

653
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,500
Here's his iPad and his phone.

654
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,790
Thank God!

655
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,420
Thanks.
- No, thank him.

656
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,080
No, thank Sona.

657
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,130
He went through a lot more trouble than me.

658
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,380
No. Thank her.
- Okay. Thanks to both of you.

659
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,286
Why should there be formalities between friends?

660
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,540
Right.

661
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,000
It's okay, I don't mind.

662
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,500
Okay, goodnight.

663
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,460
Ram.

664
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,580
Friends?

665
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,130
Only friends. Nothing else.

666
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,630
Okay, okay.
Friends.

667
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,880
What happened?
- My glass...

668
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,500
Go, get the ball.

669
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,710
Loser! Loser! Loser!

670
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,460
Loser!
I'll show you all.

671
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:02,080
Loser! Loser! Loser!

672
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,920
Please don't touch!

673
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,420
That was fun.

674
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,420
Did that horse belong to you?
- Yes.

675
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,710
The ball knocked it over and it broke.

676
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,290
Sona!

677
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,630
It has always been with you, right?

678
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,130
My brother gave this to me.

679
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,130
I love it more than my life.

680
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:03,080
I never thought that I'd lose it someday.

681
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,880
Counting the stars.

682
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,250
I'll also join.

683
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:31,380
One, two, three, four...

684
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,380
Five, six, seven

685
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,630
eight, nine...
I calculated wrong.

686
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,130
It's the same one.
The one your brother gave you.

687
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,170
I went through a lot of trouble to put it back together.

688
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:20,920
It had too many marks on it.

689
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,290
I decorated it to cover them up.

690
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,170
You can take it off, if you don't like it.

691
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,830
It's nice.
- Thanks, Ram.

692
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,790
Since you didn't, I thanked myself.

693
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,210
Okay, bye.

694
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,830
You called?

695
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:52,460
Why did you take so much trouble for me?

696
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:57,330
Do you want me to be honest?
- Yes.

697
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,420
To see this smile on your face.

698
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,710
Is that all?
- Yes.

699
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,670
Nothing else?
- No.

700
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:10,170
Not even something-something?
- No.

701
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,170
What?

702
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:26,080
"I feel so alive."

703
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:31,670
"I love you more than I can say."

704
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:03,330
"It's just me, my heart and you."

705
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,290
"So, why feel shy?"

706
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:13,880
"I never saw anyone like you."

707
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,420
"Where were you all my life?"

708
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:25,170
"I feel so alive."

709
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:30,630
"I love you more than I can say."

710
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,920
"Whenever you are close"

711
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:10,210
"I want that moment to freeze."

712
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,380
"I wish time stops whenever we're close."

713
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:20,830
"I wish time stops whenever we're close."

714
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,670
"I feel so full of breath."

715
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,540
"My heart skips a beat more often."

716
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,960
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."

717
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:00,960
"Thinks about you every moment."

718
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:03,670
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."

719
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:06,130
"Thinks about you every moment."

720
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,960
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."

721
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,460
"Thinks about you every moment."

722
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:17,250
"Our hearts reach out to each other."

723
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:22,580
"I feel deeply in love with you."

724
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:43,130
Sir. Someone has come between you and Sona.

725
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:46,880
Who can come between us?
- See for yourself.

726
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,380
Come with me. Come on.
Quickly.

727
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:53,830
Quick. Look.
- Where?

728
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,670
That's you. That's Sona.

729
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,380
And there's a third star between you two.

730
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,170
No one can come between us.

731
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,130
It's just probably for a while.

732
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,540
Get back to work.
- If you say so.

733
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,380
But I was worried.

734
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,080
That's Sona.
That's Sona's brother.

735
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,420
Who's the third one?
- What?

736
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,580
Nothing...

737
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,210
Are you going to wear glasses during the rituals?

738
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,540
She'll wear them even on her wedding night.

739
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:39,750
Even if she does, the lights in
the room will be switched off.

740
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,041
You shouldn't be talking like this at your age.

741
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,580
At my age, all I can do is talk.

742
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,880
"You're my refuge, my tormentor."

743
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,170
"You're an unsolved riddle."

744
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:05,380
"What are my eyes looking for?"

745
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:09,290
"Beloved."

746
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,380
"Don't trouble me."

747
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,710
"Beloved."

748
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:22,040
"Don't trouble me."

749
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,960
"Beloved."
- Ram.

750
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:47,330
"Don't trouble me."
- Ram...

751
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,670
"You're an unsolved.."

752
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,080
Not mine.
Take your aunt's blessings.

753
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,250
Bless you.
- Mom.

754
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,210
Did you ever hit me?
- Why would she?

755
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,630
She'll hit your dad.
- Uncle, please.

756
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:15,290
Mom, I'm serious.
Have you ever hit me?

757
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,460
Never.
But...

758
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:24,920
Hi, buddy!
How are you?

759
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,040
Dad, did you ever hit me?
- What are you saying?

760
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,920
How can anyone think of hitting you?

761
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,710
What's wrong?
- Okay, dad. I'll call you later.

762
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,580
Ram!
- What?

763
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,830
I am sorry, Ram!
I am sorry.

764
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,040
Ram.
It was my mistake.

765
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,000
You can kiss me if you want.

766
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,250
Forgive me. I am sorry, Ram.
- Sona.

767
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:26,330
I am sorry.
I am sorry.

768
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:33,420
"How do they stay awake at nights?"

769
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,330
"And stare at the stars."

770
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,500
I am also sorry, Sona.

771
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:41,750
"How do they stay awake at nights?"

772
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,380
"How do they stay awake at nights"

773
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,130
"and stare at the stars?"

774
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:49,130
"Dwell in the eyes."

775
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:53,920
Ram! I am very happy today.
- Me too.

776
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,790
What were you two thinking?

777
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,330
That I won't find out?
- Please, Riya.

778
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,500
Please...
- While arrangements for my wedding were on...

779
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,750
You two were planning your own, right?

780
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,170
Please, Riya.
- Let me get married.

781
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,880
I'll get you two married too.
- Riya.

782
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:25,000
Phone.

783
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,460
Give it.
- Hurry up.

784
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,420
Sir will give the green signal.
- So much luggage?

785
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,250
As if your own sister's getting married.

786
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:36,330
I have a sister but Riya doesn't have a brother.
- I see.

787
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:40,960
See you.
- Hey! You forgot this.

788
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,170
Look after the house.
Be careful.

789
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:47,290
Gauri, be careful.

790
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:54,210
What are you doing?
- Deleting your number.

791
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,630
Why?
- I won't attend this wedding.

792
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,678
This wedding will get over today.

793
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:00,859
Tomorrow, everyone will return.

794
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,670
Leaving me and my daughter behind.

795
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,580
What are you looking at?
Look at me.

796
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:07,960
I see! So, that's the problem.

797
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,630
Sister.
- Yes, brother. What is it?

798
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,750
Can you tell him what we were talking about yesterday?

799
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,290
What?

800
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:19,290
About Ram and Dolly.
- Yes.

801
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,500
Mister.
We accept your proposal.

802
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,790
But let this wedding get over.
We will talk about it in detail.

803
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:30,130
Ma'am!
- Bless you.

804
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:31,960
Let's go.
The procession's arriving.

805
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:34,080
Yes, ma'am.
- What are you doing?

806
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,250
Give me your phone number.

807
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:13,040
Welcome. Welcome.
- Bless you.

808
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:17,330
Let that be.
Talk about cash. Money.

809
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,790
Where's the money?
- This way.

810
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,250
This way.
- Inside. Get it out!

811
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,330
What are you doing?

812
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:30,290
Hey! Why do you keep troubling her?

813
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,210
Today's the last day to have some fun.

814
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,830
Once the wedding is over, there
won't be any chance to do this.

815
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,500
What's wrong with you?

816
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:45,960
You're upset because you'll miss me in Australia, right?
- Yes.

817
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,170
Listen...

818
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:53,170
What are you doing?
Let go of my hand.

819
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:56,830
Ram, leave my hand.
Someone might see us.

820
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:57,880
You're always joking...

821
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,710
I'm going back to Australia tomorrow.

822
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,540
People say that boys who come from abroad are conmen

823
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,040
flirts and spoilt brats.

824
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:15,170
No.
I am not one of them, Sona.

825
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,460
I love you.

826
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:23,080
"I feel so alive."

827
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,920
"I love you more than I can say."

828
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,040
As soon as I get to Australia, I'll talk to dad about us.

829
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,250
And to your brother too.

830
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,130
Dolly. Let go. Let go!
- I love Ram.

831
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,080
I want to die.
- Dear, you'll hurt yourself.

832
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:53,540
What are you doing?

833
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,830
Ma'am...
- We should teach her a lesson.

834
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,580
Such girls are always on the lookout to entice rich boys.

835
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,790
If we don't act now, we'll lose Ram.

836
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,290
I mean it.

837
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,500
Come on.
- Ram!

838
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:18,540
Come here.
- What, mom?

839
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:23,540
You will have to go to the jewelry shop right now.
- Now?

840
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,250
Why?

841
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,540
Riya's my niece.

842
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,500
I wanted to gift her gold bangles on her wedding.

843
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:37,580
But I forgot to get them.
- But how am I going to choose?

844
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:41,290
Take Bijli along, if you can't do it alone.

845
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,130
Bijli.
- Yes, she's right.

846
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,540
Let's go or we'll miss the wedding.

847
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:49,540
There is no need to hurry.

848
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,420
Get some nice and expensive bangles.
Okay?

849
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,540
Come on.
Let's go.

850
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,290
Ma'am, would you like some tea?

851
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:25,170
How old are you?
- 20.

852
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,830
You look smart for your age.

853
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:36,500
Let's go.
Let's go.

854
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,250
Let's go, everyone.

855
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,830
Who else is there in your family?

856
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,670
Just an elder brother.

857
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,580
What does he do?
- Farming.

858
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,170
Farming!

859
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:52,210
We have a poultry farm and we sell milk too.

860
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,420
Did you take your brother's permission

861
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,630
to attend this wedding?
- Yes, ma'am.

862
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,170
I never do anything without my brother's permission.

863
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,380
Then you must've taken his permission

864
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:05,750
to entice my son.

865
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,170
Why are you quiet?
- What would she say now.

866
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:13,540
Her entire plan has been ruined now.

867
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,420
Riya.
Your aunt's yelling at Sona.

868
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:22,130
I was really impressed with how hard this girl's working.

869
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,830
Now I understood what she was up to.

870
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,630
Why are you yelling at her?

871
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:29,960
We were busy with the wedding.

872
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:33,040
And she grabbed the opportunity to entice Ram.

873
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,540
Don't say that, sir.

874
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,960
Ram likes her too.
- Yes.

875
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,540
That's what her plan is.

876
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,210
Sir, please...
- Shut up, Riya.

877
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,460
Let the elders handle this. Quiet!
- But...

878
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:46,250
If you have any shame, then leave right now.

879
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,830
And find someone else.

880
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,130
See. Didn't I tell you?

881
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,380
She can't stay without me at all.

882
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,460
See. How she is crying.

883
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:26,130
Your brother's here.
Stop crying like a baby.

884
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:32,040
Riya. How are you?

885
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,380
Look. I've brought this wedding sari for you.

886
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,960
Wear this during the nuptials.
You will look really nice.

887
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:45,630
You must be Riya's dad.

888
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:48,500
I was rather young when I saw you.

889
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,960
I brought this shawl for you.

890
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,540
Brother!

891
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:02,420
What's going on?

892
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:12,830
What happened here, Sona?
- See. Both siblings are alike.

893
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,170
We invited you to attend the wedding

894
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:18,000
not to entice rich boys.
- What are you saying?

895
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:21,630
The sister was flirting around with a billionaire kid.

896
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,580
And the brother doesn't even have a clue.

897
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:28,710
Not a word against my sister or I will kill you.

898
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,130
If you find out about your sister's deeds

899
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,420
you will beat her black and blue.

900
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,830
No, brother.
No.

901
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:00,290
It's your fault and you are fuming at us.

902
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,670
Who are you?

903
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:03,330
A simple peasant who works in the fields

904
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:07,290
and owns some cattle and poultry.

905
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,960
You're not even fit to be our servant.

906
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,630
How dare you try to entice my son?

907
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:19,290
Get out!
Get out of here!

908
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,500
Didn't you hear what she said?

909
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:24,920
We've seen enough of your sister's dirty tricks.

910
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:26,750
Take her away.

911
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:32,170
Let's go, Sona.

912
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,250
Mr. Raghuveer...
Please forgive me.

913
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:51,540
It's my sister's wedding, so I'm leaving quietly.

914
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,670
Otherwise.. Each one of you...

915
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,460
Let's go.

916
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:20,540
Hurry up, Bijli. Hurry up.
We're losing time.

917
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,580
Not here, put it in that car.
- This car?

918
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,080
Where is everyone?
Here they are.

919
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,750
Call me as soon as you reach, dear.

920
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,880
Yes.

921
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,210
I'll bid adieu to Ram.
- Go on. But be quick.

922
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,000
Yes.

923
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:45,380
I want to say something before I leave.

924
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:49,080
Listen only to your heart.

925
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,080
You think, Sona left you.

926
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:56,210
She's left her heart behind for you.

927
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,670
Go, take a look in her room.

928
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:01,540
Let's go, dear.
You are getting late.

929
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,580
Bye, Riya.

930
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,670
My brother gave this to me.

931
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,250
I love it more than my life.

932
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,460
I never thought that I'd lose it someday.

933
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:00,040
Ram.
Ram.

934
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:05,330
What are you doing here?
Everyone's waiting for you.

935
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,500
Let's go.
- Go on, I'll join you.

936
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,960
We're going back home tomorrow.

937
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,580
You remember your promise, don't you?

938
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:17,040
You're coming with me.
- Yes, mom.

939
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:19,040
The wedding was grand.

940
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:21,420
But that girl messed things up.
- Forget her.

941
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,250
Look there. They look so nice.
- What?

942
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:27,790
Made for each other.
Is it not?

943
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:31,880
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so silent?

944
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,960
Juice?
- Leave!

945
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:38,500
Why are you thinking about her?

946
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:42,420
She came and left, just like a passing cloud.

947
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,130
But I.. I am still with you.

948
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:51,210
Can you wait for me?
- Of course I can.

949
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,500
One year?
- Yes.

950
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:54,960
Five years?

951
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:59,960
15 years?

952
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:05,040
You can't, but Sona can.

953
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:14,790
You're the passing cloud, Sona isn't.

954
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,960
"The clouds are thundering."

955
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,330
"Enraging someone."

956
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,040
Don't pay heed to him, dear.

957
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:28,920
He or his dad has no say in their family.

958
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,210
They all listen to his mom.

959
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:35,080
And she has promised me.

960
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,710
I know what you went through.

961
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:56,500
Rich people always behave this way.

962
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,920
Brother got humiliated because of me.

963
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,500
Still he didn't say a word to me.

964
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:07,330
He will get disturbed, on seeing you so upset.

965
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:11,380
Take my advice.
Forget everything.

966
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,170
I cannot forget Ram.

967
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,750
What?
What are you saying?

968
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,960
Ram didn't catch the flight!
- He was with me till Singapore.

969
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,330
But he never boarded the connecting flight.

970
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,420
He's betrayed me.
- What nonsense!

971
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,710
What for?
- Love.

972
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:39,500
Love?
Oh, my God!

973
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,040
"I'm raw and crispy.
At the prime of my youth."

974
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:01,080
"I'm like a sweet fruit.
Oh, my!"

975
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,920
"I'm raw and crispy.
At the prime of my youth."

976
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,670
"I'm like a sweet fruit.
Oh, my!"

977
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:17,170
"Sharp eyes. That can pierce
your heart. Oh, my!"

978
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,790
"Grab this chance."

979
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,580
"Give me your heart, and in return.."

980
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:25,290
"A magical hug, take it right now!"

981
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,000
"You won't get it again."

982
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:36,250
"A magical hug, take it right now!"

983
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:38,580
"You won't get it again."

984
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:44,250
"A kiss from these lips.
You won't get it again."

985
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:48,960
"Magical hug! Magical hug!"

986
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,710
"A kiss from your lips.
Give me the magical hug."

987
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,170
"You walk along every lane."

988
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:11,920
"Giving hugs and kisses."

989
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:19,830
"You walk along every lane.
Giving hugs and kisses."

990
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:25,380
"Take a look at me.
And I'll be lucky."

991
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:28,080
"If you want to be lucky,
if you want to be cosy."

992
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:33,460
"Hear me out. There's a gold
shop at the next corner."

993
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:36,290
"In exchange for the gold ornaments, I'll give you.."

994
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:38,920
"A magical hug, take it right now!"

995
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,500
"You won't get it again."

996
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:49,830
"A magical hug, take it right now!"

997
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,250
"You won't get it again.
A kiss from these lips."

998
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,960
"You won't get it again."

999
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:14,500
"My style's very special."

1000
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,580
"My style's very special."

1001
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,790
"Anyone loses their heart to me."

1002
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,710
"Try to impress me with your
style and you'll be the loser."

1003
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,460
"I'm leaving with my hug."

1004
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:36,170
"No, no, beloved.
I won't try to show-off my style."

1005
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,880
"Take anything you want,
but in return give me.."

1006
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,750
"A magical hug, take it right now!"

1007
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,380
"You won't get it again."

1008
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,540
"A magical hug, take it right now!"

1009
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:54,920
"You won't get it again."

1010
01:21:55,380 --> 01:22:00,630
"A kiss from these lips.
You won't get it again."

1011
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:05,880
"Magical hug! Magical hug!"

1012
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:11,290
"A kiss from your lips."

1013
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,420
Sona.

1014
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:58,790
Aren't you the station master?

1015
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,630
And who are you?

1016
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,580
How did you come here without a ticket?

1017
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,670
I have a ticket.

1018
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:24,040
Careful, sir.

1019
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,000
There was a plate in the way.

1020
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:33,170
Go on.
Complete the rituals.

1021
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,420
Excuse me, sir.

1022
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:52,880
You're already making me nervous.

1023
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:56,250
I wonder what you will do after hearing me.

1024
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:57,670
I am Ram.

1025
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:02,170
The same Ram, who is in love with your sister.

1026
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,710
Hi!
Sir. Sir.

1027
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,790
Your sister's a really nice girl.

1028
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,380
You don't know how long it took me to woo her.

1029
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,540
Sorry.

1030
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:23,750
It wouldn't have sounded so bad in English.

1031
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,290
But what shall I do?
You don't know English.

1032
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,420
My family shouldn't have insulted you.

1033
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,250
You brought Sona home in a fit of rage.

1034
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:32,750
You did the right thing.

1035
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,540
I apologize on behalf of my family.

1036
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,710
Please forgive me.
- Are you done?

1037
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:41,380
Or do you have anything else to say?

1038
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,790
I don't know if I made sense.

1039
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,920
But that's what it is.

1040
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:53,960
Come with me.

1041
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:05,880
Raghuveer, why are you taking him inside?

1042
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:09,880
What is this, sir?
He wants to talk to me in private.

1043
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,960
Come, sir. Let's go.

1044
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:15,210
He's digging his own grave.

1045
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,630
You're completely the opposite of what I thought you'd be.

1046
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,330
You're a complete gentleman.

1047
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,960
Wow! Nice house.

1048
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:31,420
Why is it so quiet?

1049
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:34,380
It's the silence before the storm.

1050
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:39,500
Afzal.
Pick him up.

1051
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,210
And throw him out of the village.

1052
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:48,500
This is your sister's problem, not yours.

1053
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,920
And throwing him out of the village won't solve anything.

1054
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,500
A sister can't express all her feelings to her brother.

1055
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:59,460
She would've told her mom about it, had she been alive.

1056
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:00,880
I've decided.

1057
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:05,830
Every time I look at her, I miss my mom.

1058
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,540
I can never forget the day

1059
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:12,500
when my dad humiliated my mom.

1060
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:16,170
She was so heart-broken that she died.

1061
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,960
The rich don't value relationships.

1062
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:28,000
I can tolerate whatever she is going through today.

1063
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:32,670
But I don't want her to face

1064
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,130
the same consequences that my mom did.

1065
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:36,710
But...

1066
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:47,330
Raghuveer.
He has come here to take his bag.

1067
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,290
No, sir.
I'm here for Sona.

1068
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:56,830
Raghuveer.
Raghuveer.

1069
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:02,500
Please.
Don't separate Sona and me.

1070
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,880
I love her more than you do.

1071
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,790
I left my parents and everything else.
For her.

1072
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,290
Tell me.
What shall I do to prove my love?

1073
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,880
Tell him to leave.

1074
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,790
A person on a death row also gets a last wish.

1075
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,290
Won't you give me one chance?

1076
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:20,580
Didn't you understand what I said?

1077
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,580
What's making you so angry?

1078
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:26,380
If your sister reminds you of your mom

1079
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,250
then he reminds me of you, in your childhood.

1080
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:32,630
Even you had begged for a chance back then.

1081
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,080
Have you forgotten everything?

1082
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,330
Without that one chance, you
wouldn't have made it this far.

1083
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:47,420
You can't have different rules for yourself and others.

1084
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:54,290
Like a fair man, you should give him a chance.

1085
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:05,710
Sona.

1086
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,500
Do you want to choose your own life partner?

1087
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:13,420
Or can I also have a say in it?

1088
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:15,960
You should also agree.

1089
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:19,630
Sir. How do I assure you of my love?

1090
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:27,630
So, you can do anything.
- Yes, sir.

1091
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,960
You'll have to do farming.

1092
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,880
I'll lend you one acre of land.

1093
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,290
You'll have to grow as much of crops as I do.

1094
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:46,460
You will have to wash the cows.
Clean their dung.

1095
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:51,250
Would you be able to do that?
- How would he do that?

1096
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:52,500
He will have to.

1097
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,630
Leaving one's parents is not a big deal.

1098
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:58,000
He'll have to toil in the fields like a farmer.

1099
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,130
The farmer, whom his mom humiliated the other day.

1100
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:04,790
Only then can he marry my sister.

1101
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:17,420
I am ready, sir.
I'll do everything you said.

1102
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,080
And grow more crops than you.

1103
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,830
What.. What are you saying?

1104
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:26,290
Then only he'll realize that I love Sona more than him.

1105
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:29,500
It's not as easy as operating a computer.

1106
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:31,290
It's too much of hard work.

1107
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:34,170
Falling in love was easy, sir.

1108
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,920
But I'll work hard to prove my love.

1109
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,210
And I'm ready for it.

1110
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:49,830
And if you lose, you'll forget my sister.

1111
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,670
And leave this village forever.

1112
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:00,130
Afzal!

1113
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:08,000
I'll wake you up at five in the morning.
Get that?

1114
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,380
Useless fellow.

1115
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:20,790
Hi, mate.
New roomie.

1116
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,290
Better.

1117
01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:00,580
I slept pretty late at night.
It was stinking.

1118
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,380
How about some tea?
- No. Cappuccino.

1119
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,830
There's your cappuccino.

1120
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:15,040
So how was the cappuccino?

1121
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:18,960
Here.
Go, clean the stable.

1122
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:29,630
"What has love.."
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1123
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:33,580
"...reduced me to?"

1124
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:38,540
Dirty fellows.
- "My heart cries.."

1125
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,540
"Someone tell me, what the future holds."

1126
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,290
Hurry up!

1127
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:50,380
"What has love reduced me to?"
- What a shitty smell.

1128
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:59,380
"My heart cries.. Someone
tell me, what the future holds."

1129
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,250
So much work, man!

1130
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,130
Aren't you done yet?

1131
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,170
Oh, no!

1132
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:29,500
Greetings, holy cow!

1133
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,880
Wrong button.

1134
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:47,420
Go. Go.

1135
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,830
Where's my tractor?

1136
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,040
Tractor?

1137
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:03,460
Stop.
Oh my God!

1138
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,460
You crazy bulls.

1139
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:07,960
Stop.
Oh my God!

1140
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:12,130
Sir, look at this foreign farmer.

1141
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:16,960
He won't last a day.
He wants a tractor.

1142
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,830
Oh, mom...

1143
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,960
Here. Eat it.

1144
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,170
Colorful.

1145
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:50,170
Water.
- Come on. Take it.

1146
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:51,670
Water.

1147
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:32,290
Listen. Catch the early train tomorrow and leave.

1148
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:34,420
There isn't any need to tolerate all this.

1149
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:20,920
"I feel so alive."

1150
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:26,960
"I love you more than I can say."

1151
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:54,830
Will I get the same thing to eat tomorrow?

1152
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:56,540
Yes.

1153
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:07,960
So, are you taking the morning train back?

1154
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:09,960
Not in your dreams.

1155
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:36,880
Out!

1156
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,960
I'm putting you on a diet from tomorrow.

1157
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:55,960
Go on.

1158
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,420
"My heart goes.."

1159
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:46,130
Come on, baby.
- "My heart goes.."

1160
01:37:46,330 --> 01:37:48,080
Let's do some farming today.

1161
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,216
At first he said that he'll discuss the marriage proposal

1162
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:51,790
when his sister returns.

1163
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:55,250
I guess, now he'll want this boy to leave first.

1164
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:58,290
Why don't you ask?
- What's there to ask?

1165
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,540
That boy's toiling hard for his love.

1166
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:03,330
He'll win the bet and throw you two out of the game.

1167
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,290
Let it be.

1168
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:39,960
Excuse me.
Where does Raghuveer stay?

1169
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:42,540
And you are from?
- Australia.

1170
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:49,670
Anybody home?
- Who is it?

1171
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:53,880
She's the girl.

1172
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:59,710
So, you're the one who has hooked the gold fish.

1173
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:02,710
I am his dad.

1174
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,670
What are you staring at?

1175
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:09,250
Go.
Call your brother.

1176
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:11,960
Who is it, Sona?

1177
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:20,960
So, you're Raghuveer.
- Yes.

1178
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:23,790
Do you know who I am?
I am Ram's dad.

1179
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,630
So, you have come here to take him back.

1180
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:28,420
No, I'm here to greet you.

1181
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:31,210
Offer you sweets.
- How rude.

1182
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:33,460
Is this how you welcome guests?

1183
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:37,210
He's not getting his due respect here because of you two.

1184
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:39,830
I don't want to be your guest of honor.

1185
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,920
Anyway, do you know what it means?

1186
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:46,290
You made my son toil like peasants.

1187
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:48,750
Do you know who he is?
- Tell him.

1188
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:52,960
His dad is one of the top 500 billionaires of Australia.

1189
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:56,500
So?
- Wait and watch, I'm going to take him away!

1190
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:57,960
So, take him away.

1191
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:02,250
Why did you keep him here for so long?

1192
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,880
We won't spare you.
- Hey!

1193
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:05,380
Mind it.

1194
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:08,670
That day, I didn't say a word because that was your house.

1195
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,420
But this is my house.

1196
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,880
If you try to raise your voice...

1197
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,580
What can you do?
What can you do?

1198
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,210
Are you threatening us?

1199
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:18,830
We can bribe the police to get you arrested.

1200
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,920
Yes.
- You need money for that.

1201
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,500
But I can kill you two right now.

1202
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:32,130
Will you kill me?

1203
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:34,250
You will kill me!

1204
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:36,330
Kill me.
Let's see. Kill me.

1205
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,540
Dad.

1206
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,210
What have you done to yourself?

1207
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,210
Why did you come here, dad?

1208
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,080
Ram. He has come all the way from Australia.

1209
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:59,330
And you're asking him why.

1210
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,500
Your condition's making me cry...

1211
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,710
Quiet.

1212
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,540
Let me talk to my son.

1213
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:08,330
Leave us alone.

1214
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:10,040
What's wrong with you, Ram?

1215
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:11,500
What are you doing?

1216
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,500
You're ruining your future for a girl.

1217
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:16,460
Come. Let's go back to Australia.

1218
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:19,380
Sorry, dad.

1219
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:23,130
Am I not your close friend?

1220
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:26,380
If you were my friend, you would help me.

1221
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:27,880
Well said, Ram.

1222
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,130
You?
Why didn't you go with them?

1223
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:34,210
Like only son, like only friend.

1224
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:50,250
Being your dad, can I ask you something?

1225
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,170
What if you lose?

1226
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:58,580
How could you ever think that?

1227
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:00,460
First answer my question.

1228
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,790
What if you lose?
- What if you fall in the well?

1229
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,750
See, I have support.
I won't fall.

1230
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:13,080
I have the support of my love.
I won't lose either.

1231
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:16,630
Love has made you crazy.

1232
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:21,750
Did I ever say that money has made you crazy?

1233
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:23,250
What a thought!

1234
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:27,000
Did you get that?
- No, I didn't.

1235
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:29,000
That's why I asked...
What was the thought?

1236
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,960
Everyone's acting wise here except me.

1237
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,630
Here, eat it.

1238
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:44,130
Idiot. What's he doing?

1239
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:47,580
I don't get it.

1240
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:49,170
Do you call this a life?

1241
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:55,380
God gifts every individual with a fate.

1242
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,920
You have everything.
So have fun.

1243
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:04,670
Once it's gone, you'll never get it back.

1244
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:08,170
Does he understand?
Is he listening?

1245
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,420
I think he's listening.

1246
01:43:11,330 --> 01:43:12,420
Bijli.

1247
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,830
Some people work hard all day and make loads of money.

1248
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,460
And consider themselves fortunate.

1249
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:20,000
But they don't know

1250
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:21,670
that the greatest wealth is love.

1251
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:24,210
And by the time they realize that

1252
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:25,790
it's too late.

1253
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,750
Love. Bloody nonsense.

1254
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:31,880
You think, this is the power of your love.

1255
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:33,460
You think I can't do this.

1256
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:34,750
Can't I eat this?

1257
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:38,080
This? You want me to eat this?

1258
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:44,250
Water? Yes.
- Water!

1259
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:46,750
Water! Water! Water!

1260
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:49,170
Quickly. Water!

1261
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:52,710
Water! Water!

1262
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:55,000
There's no water in the car.

1263
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,630
Water! Water!

1264
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:12,170
How can you eat this?

1265
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:15,330
It can kill anyone.

1266
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:19,790
You're not used to eating this.

1267
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:24,290
Can you endure anything for your love?

1268
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:28,210
Does love really give you all this strength?

1269
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:32,040
If it wasn't for love, I wouldn't have come here.

1270
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,580
Neither would you have come for me.

1271
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:41,540
Pardon me.
I'm not rich like you.

1272
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:44,250
I'm just a station master.

1273
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:49,130
It hurts you to see your son eat this crap.

1274
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:52,210
But she eats this too.

1275
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:54,920
If Ram sleeps on the floor

1276
01:45:55,290 --> 01:45:58,420
then so does she.

1277
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:03,290
You must be thinking that these are old rustic values.

1278
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,170
That's true.

1279
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:07,210
But that's how she is.

1280
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:12,630
And every day, she prays in the temple for his victory.

1281
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:25,380
Don't ever let that lamp extinguish, dear.

1282
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:30,080
My son has led a life of luxury and comfort.

1283
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,920
He has never done anything all his life.

1284
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:38,920
Seeing him toil here made me go crazy.

1285
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:42,790
Your love has shown me and my son

1286
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:45,380
the value of this soil.

1287
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,750
God bless you.

1288
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:53,420
God bless you, dear.

1289
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,540
Your decision's wrong, brother-in-law.

1290
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:57,380
My sister will never agree.

1291
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:00,330
In fact, it can create problems between you two.

1292
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:01,580
Yes.

1293
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,210
It can make things worse.

1294
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:05,130
I don't want any problem

1295
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:07,080
between the two of you because of me.

1296
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:08,630
- Yes.
- Don't worry.

1297
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:12,130
I know my wife's weaknesses.

1298
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,540
She always listens to useless
and good-for-nothing people.

1299
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:16,290
I'm returning home today.

1300
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:19,330
I know how to make my wife understand.

1301
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:21,540
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me.

1302
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,880
I tried my best.
- Take a look.

1303
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,345
Take a look at my daughter's condition.

1304
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:29,420
What's going to happen to her now?

1305
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:31,080
Stop it, JP. Stop it.

1306
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:33,670
My sister won't agree so easily.

1307
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:38,540
Look. Your only concern is
that Ram might marry that girl.

1308
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:41,830
But he'll have to win the challenge for that.

1309
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:45,000
Yes. And Raghuveer doesn't want Ram to win.

1310
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:47,040
Ram will definitely lose.

1311
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:49,580
Say that again.

1312
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:52,670
Ram will definitely lose! 100%.

1313
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:18,630
"My dormant life.."

1314
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:22,540
"My dormant life.."

1315
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:30,880
"Has found wings after meeting you."

1316
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,380
"After meeting you."

1317
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:39,670
"My dormant life.."

1318
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,790
"Has found wings.."

1319
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:47,210
"Has found wings"

1320
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:50,420
"after meeting you."

1321
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:56,540
"It's the influence of your love."

1322
01:48:56,750 --> 01:49:02,460
"My heart now dwells in you."

1323
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:08,670
"God's blessed me with His grace since we met."

1324
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,580
"Since we met, I've found myself."

1325
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:20,630
"Since I was braced.."

1326
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:23,750
"Since I was braced.."

1327
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:30,080
"Braced by the color of love."

1328
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:36,080
There are crops in everyone's fields.

1329
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:38,920
But nothing in mine.

1330
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:51,460
Ram.

1331
01:50:00,290 --> 01:50:02,920
Yeah! There are crops in my field too.

1332
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:16,210
"Look at the sky melting away."

1333
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:21,080
"Conveys through the droplets."

1334
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:26,540
"My love."

1335
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:34,670
"My unbound love."

1336
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:38,540
"Who cares about the world"

1337
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:42,670
"when the heart has crossed all boundaries?"

1338
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:48,630
"My world seems so new."

1339
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:54,500
"You've renewed me."

1340
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,750
"Since I was braced.."

1341
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:05,460
"Braced by the color of love."

1342
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:32,210
"The color of love's so strong."

1343
01:51:32,830 --> 01:51:37,210
"It has touched my soul."

1344
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:41,380
"Can't seem to get rid of it."

1345
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,420
Please. Give that back.

1346
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:50,630
"Can't seem to get rid of it."
- Just a minute.

1347
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:58,580
"It's become an unforgettable promise."

1348
01:51:58,790 --> 01:52:04,540
"An unbreakable bond of the heart."

1349
01:52:04,670 --> 01:52:08,080
"Since I was braced.."

1350
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:10,540
"Braced by the color of love."

1351
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:13,460
"Since I was braced.."

1352
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:18,210
"Since I was braced.."

1353
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:22,790
"Braced by the color of love."

1354
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:25,830
"Since I was braced.."

1355
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:33,040
"Since I was braced.."

1356
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:38,500
Hello.
- The situation's getting worse.

1357
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:40,960
That girl won't let go of Ram easily.

1358
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:42,960
I think we'll lose Ram.

1359
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:45,460
I am holding on to your promise.

1360
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:47,880
I always keep my promise.

1361
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:49,710
The same will happen this time too.

1362
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:51,380
What do I do now?

1363
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,630
No need to tell me what you'll do.

1364
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:58,040
But she shouldn't become my daughter-in-law.

1365
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:00,170
Just wait and watch now.

1366
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,250
They won't know what hit them.

1367
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:19,790
Who are you?

1368
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:24,290
It's me.
- You.

1369
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:26,750
What are you doing here?
- Making a canal.

1370
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,170
Canal? Why?

1371
01:53:30,330 --> 01:53:32,580
To save the fields from the rain.

1372
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:36,460
It won't rain. Just leave.

1373
01:53:38,670 --> 01:53:40,630
I think it's going to rain.

1374
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:44,330
You fool.
I've been farming here for years.

1375
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,710
And you're going to teach me about rain.

1376
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:48,750
These are just storm clouds.

1377
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:51,170
It's not going to rain...

1378
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:06,330
Afzal!
- Don't worry, sir.

1379
01:54:07,170 --> 01:54:09,580
I already made a canal in your field.

1380
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:13,540
You're getting drenched.

1381
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:15,330
I'll handle things here.

1382
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,670
Raghu!

1383
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:30,170
Raghu! Raghu!

1384
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:31,960
Why are you sleeping here?

1385
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:38,130
What's wrong?
- I was missing mom.

1386
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:41,130
Sir, I was thinking...
- Stop thinking.

1387
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:43,500
I have good news for you.

1388
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:45,960
Sona has scored first class marks in her exams.

1389
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:47,710
Yes, first class.

1390
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:49,880
Sona.

1391
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:53,920
Take sir's blessings.

1392
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,880
Always be successful.

1393
01:54:57,330 --> 01:54:59,830
Marry the one you love.

1394
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:02,880
And lead a happy life.

1395
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:07,250
I didn't say that deliberately.

1396
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:08,380
It just slipped out.

1397
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,460
What are you looking at?

1398
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:13,960
I would've gifted Sona the railway station

1399
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:15,920
if she had been my daughter.

1400
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:16,960
What are you giving her?

1401
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:19,040
Go ahead, Sona.

1402
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:20,710
Ask for anything you want.

1403
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:22,040
Bangles. Earrings.

1404
01:55:22,330 --> 01:55:23,330
Go ahead.

1405
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:25,330
Go.

1406
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,080
Ask away, Sona.
What do you want?

1407
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:33,290
Can we arrange a feast for the villagers?

1408
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:35,670
Of course, invite everyone.

1409
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:37,670
Brother.

1410
01:55:39,460 --> 01:55:40,790
Ram is in the village too.

1411
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:43,630
Can he attend as well?

1412
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:49,710
Fine. Since we're inviting
everyone, invite him too.

1413
01:55:52,670 --> 01:55:56,000
He has agreed but only after hesitating.

1414
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,710
But careful.

1415
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:18,130
Your brother's coming.

1416
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:29,880
Can I get two more?

1417
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:35,580
Just two?

1418
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:46,330
Someone, tie the bull.

1419
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:47,960
He's overeaten.

1420
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:50,290
You're mistaken.

1421
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:54,040
That was me belching, not that bull.

1422
01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:55,710
You're mistaken too.

1423
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:58,710
He meant you, not the bull.

1424
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,960
Quiet.
Don't act smart.

1425
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:02,130
And careful...

1426
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:11,210
Thank you.
- What for?

1427
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:13,630
You invited the entire village

1428
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:15,710
so that I get to eat good food.

1429
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:22,130
The other day, I ate that spicy food

1430
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:24,080
and you gave me a bonus.

1431
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:26,080
Today, you've excelled in your exams

1432
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:27,960
and all I get is food?

1433
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:31,130
No bonus?

1434
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:34,380
Friends, on the occasion of Sona's achievement

1435
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,250
everyone will get a bonus from me.

1436
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:39,500
A box of sweets each.

1437
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:51,540
I've realized how much you love Sona.

1438
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,040
No one can love her more than you.

1439
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:04,920
Sona.

1440
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:08,130
Sona. Come quickly.

1441
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:21,500
Let go.

1442
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:24,460
Sir!
Let go of me.

1443
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:34,250
Get lost.

1444
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:08,880
Hello.

1445
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,670
My name is Rao.

1446
01:59:10,830 --> 01:59:13,250
People are terrified of me.

1447
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:14,380
I know.

1448
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:16,290
Who is the target?

1449
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,040
He's the right man.

1450
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:21,830
Straight to the point.

1451
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:27,580
Keep this.

1452
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:29,170
I'll tell you the job later.

1453
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:37,710
I'll destroy the entire crop.

1454
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:40,170
Mix it.

1455
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:41,920
Mix it. Mix it.

1456
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:46,080
Boss. This is a new fertilizer.

1457
01:59:47,210 --> 01:59:49,880
One liter will turn the fields lush green.

1458
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,580
And two liters will make it barren like a desert.

1459
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:58,040
Add three.
- Fine, boss.

1460
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,960
Look, boss.
- Pour it.

1461
02:00:12,290 --> 02:00:15,830
Let's go.
Run. Quickly.

1462
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:21,960
Who is that?

1463
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:24,710
Boss.
- Yes.

1464
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,040
I don't know.

1465
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:32,670
Double action.

1466
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:35,540
Same to same.

1467
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,210
What's he doing?

1468
02:01:00,210 --> 02:01:01,420
What's wrong with you all?

1469
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,080
Why is everyone making a ruckus?

1470
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:39,540
Oh, God!

1471
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:42,330
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1472
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,170
Fire! Fire!

1473
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:21,670
Fire! Fire!

1474
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,460
Sir, fire.

1475
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:28,630
Afzal.
- Sir, fire!

1476
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:29,750
Come to your senses.

1477
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:32,040
Throw water. Quickly!

1478
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:39,420
Come on.

1479
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:47,830
Careful.

1480
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,210
Hurry up.

1481
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:14,130
Move.

1482
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:20,420
Ram!

1483
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,330
No, Sona.

1484
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:25,580
No, Sona.
- Ram...

1485
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:27,960
Sona. Stop.

1486
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:30,040
Ram.
- Stop, I...

1487
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:45,880
Are you crazy?

1488
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,351
What if something had happened to you?

1489
02:03:48,170 --> 02:03:51,880
What?
What's in the box?

1490
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:10,830
"I feel so alive."

1491
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:16,540
"I love you more than I can say."

1492
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:49,213
Brilliant!
You did the right thing.

1493
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:50,960
Destroyed everything completely.

1494
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:52,710
What are you thinking now?

1495
02:04:54,170 --> 02:04:58,290
Who was that guy in glasses, I saw in the fields?

1496
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:00,080
Keep thinking.

1497
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:02,540
I'll find someone else to do my job.

1498
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:06,380
Your idea to ruin the crops was wrong.

1499
02:05:07,210 --> 02:05:08,710
Give me another chance.

1500
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,830
If I fail this time you can...

1501
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,130
Clobber me with your shoe.

1502
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:15,920
I have a plan.
- You do?

1503
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:17,250
Then it must be good.

1504
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:18,580
Go ahead. Do it.

1505
02:05:33,460 --> 02:05:34,460
Sona.

1506
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:37,210
Sona.

1507
02:05:41,330 --> 02:05:43,170
The crops will be harvested tomorrow.

1508
02:05:44,830 --> 02:05:46,580
That will decide our future.

1509
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,210
Are you worried?

1510
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,460
I feel something-something too.

1511
02:05:56,330 --> 02:05:58,750
In my excitement, I told him,
I'll grow more crops than him.

1512
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:02,500
I was a little overconfident, right?

1513
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,920
A bit.

1514
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:07,580
Your brother's a nice man.

1515
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:11,460
Ask him not to throw me out if I fail.

1516
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:14,460
I'll work like a peasant.

1517
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:18,540
I cannot leave this village.

1518
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:21,040
The cattle.

1519
02:06:21,330 --> 02:06:22,330
The fields.

1520
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:24,040
Your brother's glare.

1521
02:06:24,790 --> 02:06:26,500
I can't live without these things anymore.

1522
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:30,380
I never imagined this but I'm used to it now.

1523
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:40,250
This is Ram's pile.

1524
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:43,290
Let's move some of it

1525
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:46,130
to Raghuveer's pile.

1526
02:06:46,670 --> 02:06:49,540
Then Ram cannot win.

1527
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:54,670
Boss, you're intelligent like a genius!

1528
02:06:55,170 --> 02:06:56,460
Are you buttering me?

1529
02:06:58,420 --> 02:06:59,380
Get to work.

1530
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:03,540
Fool.

1531
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:18,790
These bloody mosquitoes...

1532
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:37,540
I forgot

1533
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:40,460
to feed the cows again.

1534
02:07:56,670 --> 02:07:58,170
Boss, you burnt your back the other day.

1535
02:07:58,290 --> 02:07:59,880
Today, you got peed on.

1536
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,790
What's happening with you, boss?

1537
02:08:02,330 --> 02:08:03,290
Did you finish the job?

1538
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:06,920
Yes, I'm done.
- Was that a joke?

1539
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:10,920
Get back to work.

1540
02:08:13,710 --> 02:08:16,710
You are so dead, Ram.

1541
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,540
Why is everyone rushing there?

1542
02:08:29,710 --> 02:08:30,917
Shouldn't we be in a hurry instead?

1543
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:33,920
Everyone wants the boy to win.

1544
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:38,040
Let's go and take a look.

1545
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:08,130
One!

1546
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:16,330
Three!

1547
02:09:19,580 --> 02:09:21,960
Five!

1548
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:32,170
What are you doing here?

1549
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:34,460
Praying for your victory?

1550
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:36,830
The offering in Ram's name is done.

1551
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:38,750
Ram?
- Here's the coconut.

1552
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:51,210
I'm really happy.

1553
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:55,080
I don't know whether he'll win or not.

1554
02:09:55,460 --> 02:09:58,080
But he has definitely won your heart.

1555
02:09:58,460 --> 02:09:59,500
No.

1556
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:01,210
He'll have to win the bet too.

1557
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:02,500
You're still adamant.

1558
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:06,210
If he loses, won't you get them married?

1559
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:10,330
He won't lose.

1560
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:16,960
He put his life at stake for my sister's toy.

1561
02:10:18,330 --> 02:10:22,170
My mom will never forgive me if he loses.

1562
02:10:24,750 --> 02:10:26,710
I saw his pile in the morning.

1563
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:29,210
It seemed a bit less.

1564
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:34,290
So, I added some of my harvest to his pile.

1565
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:40,330
When you were a kid, I bet on your honesty.

1566
02:10:40,830 --> 02:10:43,330
Today I won.

1567
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:44,880
Break the coconut.

1568
02:11:00,670 --> 02:11:03,420
We won, Sona!

1569
02:11:03,710 --> 02:11:06,250
We won.
- Rascal. Come on.

1570
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:12,630
How will I face my daughter now?

1571
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,790
What will I say to Ram's mom?

1572
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:18,960
Your stupid plan has ruined me.

1573
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:26,880
Now... I'll finish this job.

1574
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:31,540
You handle the police.

1575
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:43,330
Sona!

1576
02:11:44,170 --> 02:11:46,670
We won, Sona!

1577
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:50,830
I managed to grow more crops!

1578
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:52,080
Two sacks!

1579
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:06,000
Get in! Get in!

1580
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:17,920
Ram!

1581
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:32,830
Bro...

1582
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:49,250
Ram!

1583
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:51,330
Ram!

1584
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:00,750
Sir...

1585
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:02,830
Sona.

1586
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:30,960
Go on.

1587
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:38,710
I proposed for your marriage with my son.

1588
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:39,960
But your brother never replied.

1589
02:13:40,130 --> 02:13:43,750
Now, I will get this wedding done.

1590
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:45,210
Come on, son.

1591
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:50,170
Tie the nuptial necklace.

1592
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:52,790
We'll see how she doesn't marry you.

1593
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:08,580
Get lost!

1594
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,040
If you marry her, her brother will kill you.

1595
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:13,960
He can't.

1596
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:17,420
He can never come here.
- Why not?

1597
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:19,670
I came here, right?

1598
02:14:20,170 --> 02:14:21,420
He'll come too.

1599
02:14:22,630 --> 02:14:23,670
Look.

1600
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:24,830
Look, he's here.

1601
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:26,380
Sona, run.

1602
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:28,960
Catch her.

1603
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:31,830
Come on, Sona.

1604
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:36,580
This way. Come on.

1605
02:14:38,750 --> 02:14:40,290
That way. Go that way.

1606
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:43,830
Here.. Sit here.

1607
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:45,880
Don't make a sound.

1608
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:02,330
Stop.

1609
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:04,420
There she is.

1610
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:07,790
Where is she?
Where is she hiding?

1611
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,960
Tell me.
- Sir!

1612
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:18,920
You dare spit on me!

1613
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:54,130
Stop!
- No!

1614
02:16:03,710 --> 02:16:04,960
Leave me!

1615
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:12,960
Faster.

1616
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:14,630
Run over them.

1617
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:15,920
Run over both of them.

1618
02:16:33,170 --> 02:16:34,170
No...

1619
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:55,710
Sorry! Sorry!

1620
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:03,790
Brother.

1621
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:06,830
Hold him!

1622
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:08,460
I will...

1623
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:10,920
Brother!

1624
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:21,080
Brother!
- Hey!

1625
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:37,170
So, you took the blame upon yourself.

1626
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:45,960
Your sister is fortunate to have a brother like you.

1627
02:18:46,210 --> 02:18:48,630
A new dawn awaits you.
Get some sleep.

1628
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:27,290
You're lucky to have a sister like Sona.

1629
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:30,670
They didn't get married

1630
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:32,460
as there wasn't any auspicious day.

1631
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:35,880
There can't be a better day than the day of your release.

1632
02:20:01,130 --> 02:20:02,630
I didn't ask her to come.

1633
02:20:03,630 --> 02:20:05,830
Ashwini came here willingly.

1634
02:21:08,420 --> 02:21:13,710
"I feel so alive."

1635
02:21:14,130 --> 02:21:19,830
"I love you more than I can say."

1636
02:21:46,250 --> 02:21:51,290
"It's just me, my heart and you."

1637
02:21:51,830 --> 02:21:56,380
"So, why feel shy?"

1638
02:21:57,130 --> 02:22:01,750
"I never saw anyone like you."

1639
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:07,790
"Where were you all my life?"

1640
02:22:08,380 --> 02:22:13,210
"I feel so alive."

1641
02:22:13,630 --> 02:22:18,710
"I love you more than I can say."

1642
02:22:48,250 --> 02:22:53,210
"Whenever you are close"

1643
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:58,290
"I want that moment to freeze."

1644
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:03,460
"I wish time stops whenever we're close."

1645
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:08,920
"I wish time stops whenever we're close."

1646
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:14,500
"I feel so full of breath."

1647
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:19,710
"My heart skips a beat more often."

1648
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:43,880
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."

1649
02:23:44,130 --> 02:23:49,130
"Thinks about you every moment."

1650
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:51,830
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."

1651
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:54,210
"Thinks about you every moment."

1652
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:57,080
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."

1653
02:23:57,250 --> 02:23:59,580
"Thinks about you every moment."

1654
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,170
"Our hearts reach out to each other."

1655
02:24:05,630 --> 02:24:10,580
"I feel deeply in love with you."
