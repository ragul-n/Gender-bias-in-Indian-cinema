Who are you?
Who are you?

21
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:31,523
Sir he is a Rockstar.
Do you think he really did murder?

22
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,899
He really did.

23
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,409
Look at him. He seem as hot as gun
just after firing the bullet.

24
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,761
Sir lets wait till the body is
recovered and then inform the media

25
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,057
I'll not be in TV till
the body is recovered.

26
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,382
That SP will be there.

27
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,030
I'll be just watching
him drinking the tea

28
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,623
Go and call the media.
Its my order.

29
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,877
Do you accept that you murdered?
It that true...do you accept that?

30
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:51,099
For you all, Gautum is a honest man.
He is a celebrity

31
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:54,172
But from now onwards he is a murderer
Killer.

32
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:57,634
Beyond the imagination,
Gautam became murderer.

33
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:59,757
 Everyone is shocked
knowing about the murder.

34
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:02,337
 Time has come for Gautam
to sit behind the bars.

35
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,261
After he ran murdering
and I hunted him down

36
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:06,056
what is the reason behind
Gautam becoming the murderer.

37
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,254
Revenging his parents
murder Gautam killed...

38
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:11,732
Inspector John Badshah
chased him and hunted him.

39
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,021
This murder revealed
other two murders.

40
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:19,698

Every channel is telecasting the Gautam news...

45
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:32,732
Sameera has put Gautam

00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:08,706
What happened actually?
How did that murder happened?

60
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:11,426
That whole murder is
shot by our news channel.

61

Don't stare at me.

<i><b>RAM</b></i>

65
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,938
He seemed beating someone.
But no one was there.

66
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,746
He fell as if someone beat him.

67
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,559
But no one was beating him.

68
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,532
All he was alone

69
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:04,203
He was fighting with nobody.
He was beaten by nobody.

70
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,718
He surrendered to police
saying he murdered him.

71
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:21,453
Though Gautam didn't murdered but police
created the sensation and made him murder.

72
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,888
So without killing anyone
Gautam became a murderer.

73
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,243
This is the Gautam's reality

74
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:28,014
Here is no any dead body Sir.

75
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:29,380
What is the reason
behind doing this?

76
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,672
This is the things
that we should know

77
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,667
Who are you, son?

78
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,564
What happened dear?

79
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,809
What happened?
Tell me?

80
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,533
Mother...
Mother?

81
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,563
Mother...
what happened?

82
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:55,576
Father...
Mother...

83
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:56,948
They killed them

84
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:57,933
Where?

85
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,562
Here...
Mother...

86
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,361
Here...
They killed my Mother here.

87
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:12,084
Here...
They killed my father here.

88
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,800
Did any murder happen here?

89
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,666
Muder?
Nothing like that happened...

90
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,749
Why are you saying that Sir?

91
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:30,051
This boy is saying that his
parents were killed here

92
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:32,594
This boy?
This boy is always like that Sir.

93
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:34,755
Whatever bus stops here, he
immediately gets in

94
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:37,449
and says "here they killed my
mother and here my father".

95
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:41,247
He's little mentle Sir.
Don't take it serious Sir.

96
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,889
He doesnot have
father and mother.

97
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:30,242
Without killing anyone,
Gautam became a murder

98
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:33,961
He's little mentle Sir.
Don't take it serious Sir.

99
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:37,352
This is called interrogation
disorder in medical terminology.

100
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,413
Comparing to normal brain, gray matter
is 25% less in Gautam's brain.

101
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:55,369
Means it reduces the
strength to remember.

102
00:22:55,746 --> 00:22:59,611
 They thinks those things as
real which are fictitious.

103
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,083
 Gautam doesn't have his
parents since childhood

104
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,696
He imagined them to
be there with him.

105
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:06,027
Whatever he do, that won't be ture.
That's why

106
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:10,993
he imagined they were killed by those three
who are right now trying to kill him.

107
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:14,380
Revenging them, he feel
that he killed them.

108
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:17,578
As a whole he created
a revenge story.

109
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:21,491
Knowing that all as unreal
he got very disturbed.

110
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,357
You don't worry. I'll treat him.

111
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,218
Now I'm going to ask you
something relating to your past.

112
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:43,939
Do you how does
your mother looks?

113
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:53,220
Do you how does
your mother looks?

114
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,838
I don't know.

115
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,246
Do you know how does
your father looks?

116
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:07,716
You don't know how was
your father and mother

117
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,242
But somebody killed them.

118
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:12,873
At least do you know the name
of your mother and father?

119
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:14,179
You don't know.

120
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:17,174
Do you know the name of the killers?
You don't know.

121
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:20,293
You don't know the name of
killers but you killed them.

122
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:26,542
So you killed those who you don't know
and where they are you don't know.

123
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:35,021
It may not be true
that I killed them

124
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:38,569
But its true that they
killed my parents.

125
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,133
Every patient always says that

126
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:42,363
No one will accept that
they are wrong.

127
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:43,964
I've seen such cases many times

128
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:45,528
What I'm saying is the truth.

129
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:48,376
I've the medical reports to prove
that what you are saying is not real.

130
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,877
What to you have?
Do you have any proof?

131
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:58,959
It this real?

132
00:24:58,959 --> 00:24:59,802
Ofcourse. Damn it

133
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:00,918
How do you know?

134
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,812
Pain.
It pains man.

135
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:06,166
As much you feel that pain
and believe it as real

136
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,511
I feel mine too and
believed it as real.

137
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:15,406
Why?
Why am I not imagining you?

138
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:17,932
Why I'm not imagining you?
Why I'm not imagining you?

139
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:20,519
Why I'm imagining those three?

140
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,657
Because...
Those...

141
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,037
Those three killed my parents.

142
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:34,743
Do you think a chance that people
Gautam imagining are real?

143
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:35,491
Impossible.

144
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,586
What if they are Real?

145
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:39,895
IMPOSSIBLE.

146
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:06,902
What truth comes from
what type of experiment?

147
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:09,455
Which truth affect
the which company?

148
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:10,823
You are the one who knows that.

149
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:14,245
What is that? Don't you know to
whom you dare will take your life?

150
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:19,540
Do you think I stopped murdering
after entering to the politics?

151
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,130
Nobody can dump the truth.

152
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,767
Because of you company products,
the climate is polluting

153
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:27,806
causing the different types of cancer.
People are dying.

154
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:31,793
They don't have any alternatives.
So they are dying.

155
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:35,074
You know the truth that's why
I'm giving you two choices.

156
00:26:35,897 --> 00:26:39,277
Do you need money?
Or do you want you life?

157
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:40,668
How many will you kill?

158
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:44,912
One...Two or Three...
Or will you kill all?

159
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:51,125
As soon as I called you came without fear.
I thought you were here for the money.

160
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,374
I understood that you
don't need your life.

161
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:57,283
My friend has the
information that I'm here.

162
00:26:57,847 --> 00:27:01,138
If you kill me, everyone
will know about it.

163
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:07,213
Everyone says when I murder there
will be no any proof because

164
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:21,611
When I thought of murdering, these
types of accedent will happen there.

166
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:55,100
Sir, again Rockstar case... If anything
unusal happens then sure suspension.

167
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,616
Shut up.
Today I'll get promotion.

168
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,141
Hello...
 Rockstar

169
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:08,685
Who do you killed this time?

170
00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:10,795
Sorry. Whom do you
imagined to kill?

171
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,965
They tried to kill me.

172
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:16,039
Oh you imagined that?
It seems attacks did happen here.

173
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,598
It appears to be realistic.

174
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:19,203
But who are they to attack you?

175
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:22,144
That one Sir.
Sir killed that one with the beer bottle, right?

176
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:23,545
His men had came to attack him.

177
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:24,863
But fearing him, they ran away.

178
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,635
Lets go and catch
them who ran away.

179
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:28,635
But we don't know
how they looks.

180
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:33,177
Sir what is he searching?

181
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:37,260
What are you searching?

182
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:38,459
Camera.

183
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,837
What?
I've taken their photos.

184
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:43,248
This time he is imagined
the camera too Sir.

185
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:46,236
How long you search,
you won't find that.

186
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:48,249
You killed with the bottle,
but there won't be the body.

187
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:50,088
You take the photos, but
there won't be the camera.

188
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,081
You just will imagine that
and I'll get the suspened.

189
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,691
Once believing you
they called me a fool.

190
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,238
Twice believing you they will call...
John Badshah...

191
00:29:56,238 --> 00:29:59,443
They'll say that because only John
Badshah knows how this happened.

192
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:01,679
How Sir?
How...? Means I'll tell you

193
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,977
Gautam broke like this.
Like this.

194
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:08,651
Look it.

195
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:13,880
John Badshah in Gautam's
house with Gautam.

196
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,165
They are telecasting
Jhon Badshah.

197
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,834
Due to the suspension, John Badshah in
Gautam's house breaking the things.

198
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:19,954
Tell us.
What do you say?

199
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:22,578
I haven't broke anything. Everything
is done imagining by him.

200
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:23,835
Go and ask Rockstar Gautam

201
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:26,730
Tell us Gautam?
You did this all?

202
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:38,672
Mr. Gautam can you prove that
really the attacks was real?

203
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:42,359
Things doesnot always becomes unreal
when it doesn't has any proof and vice versa

204
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,576
There are also the truth
beyond the camera.

205
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:02,485
Gautam.
Stop.

206
00:31:05,123 --> 00:31:08,011
Gautam stop the car.
Gautam.

207
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:11,332
Real.
Fasity.

208
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:13,404
This all might not be real

209
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:17,030
But I don't need any those reality which force
me to believe that my past is falsehood.

210
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,932
Till now for what I
believed and lived

211
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:21,858
After hearing that were not Real.
I became unable bear it.

00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:24,335
Thats why.... the people
they believe unreal

213
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:27,746

I'm going near to that.

214
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:34,310
Mother

215
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,353

219
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:48,378
Gautam... Stop dear

220
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:50,557
Don't run dear.

00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:51,758
Excuse me Sir.

222
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:53,982

I said stop...

226
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:17,840
Where were you running?

227
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:33,688
Due to use of seeds,
land is becoming infertile

228
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:36,165
Animals are dying,
people are suffering

229
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:39,590
Don't make people busy with the interrogation
part, make them understand the matter directly

Animals are dying.

235
00:32:48,825 --> 00:32:51,185
Nobody is taking interest.
God must come to save it.

236
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:55,455
NGOS are saying about Hydrogen Cyanide
getting mixed in the seeds.

237
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:58,005
This is the report.
Government should now...

238
00:32:59,135 --> 00:33:00,695
Its dangerous, right?

239
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:02,790
Not only this, there
are many more truths.

240
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,845
Everythings will come out.

241
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,795
Guess what?

242
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:16,072

the location of Gautam.

243
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:16,726

I'm flying.

247
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:12,650
At last. To meet you means I've to
come in a speed boat like James Bond.

248
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,982
How did you know that I'm here?

249
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:15,636
Your bad luck Sir.

250
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,428
Media. They find
where ever you go.

00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:20,379
What do you want?
Just 10 minutes. Small interview.

252
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:22,296
Don't you know the
meaning of privacy?

253
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,637
Where ever you go and disturb.

254
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:28,498
Knowing the value of privacy, if I
hadn't telecasted your footage in TV

255
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:31,222
You'll not be here but
relaxing in the jail.

256
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:32,691
Just get out from here.

257
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,022
Fine. I know the value of
privacy so I'm going right now.

258
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:40,187
If you know the value of gratitude
then come for the interview.

If you say no and neglect it
then I'll jump in the sea.

262
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,790
Why are you coming again?

263
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,924
Don't you understand

And asked for the interview.

00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:23,425
That means you imagined
me coming here.

272
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,505
Generally fans imagine about you.

00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,810

280
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:50,795
Don't give the interview.
It seems you don't like interview.

281
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:51,993
Tell me... Tell me...

282

286
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:02,544

So...thats my character.

Evening 5:30. Come to the Beatles Shop.

One coffee Sir.

296
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:26,149
Mr. Rockstar...
Remember it...

297
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:30,176
A Star can live without AC but
can't survive without fans.

298
00:36:30,176 --> 00:36:34,357
5:30 Beatles. If not then
I'll jump in the sea

299
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:48,974
You came here?

300
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,590
I can't believe this.

301
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,493
Actually I thought
you won't come here.

302
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:54,039
I've been egarly
waiting for this.

303
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,118
I won't take times. Just 10 minutes.
That's all.

304
00:36:56,118 --> 00:36:57,125
Order for the coffee.

305
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,976
Good idea. Lets take the interview
while drinkin the coffee.

306
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:05,302
What interview?
You said about the treat.

307
00:37:05,302 --> 00:37:07,645
Generally people thinks
my interview as a treat.

308
00:37:07,645 --> 00:37:08,735
Are you playing the game?

309
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:10,738
Because I said no
for the interview.

310
00:37:10,738 --> 00:37:12,901
So you are lying saying
about the treat.

311
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,276
What treat?

312
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:20,018
5:30 Beatles. I thought you
came for the interview.

313
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,039
If you want to have coffee with
me, then ask for the coffee?

314
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,486
If you want the interview
then ask for the interview?

315
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:25,772
But don't act like this.

316
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:27,270
Cheap media tricks.

317
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:31,418
Look Mr. Gautam

318
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,473
Don't think that every girls from
India wants to have coffee with you

319
00:37:34,473 --> 00:37:38,561
We journalists come for the interviews.
Not for the coffee.

320
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:41,098
So, thank you.

321
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:50,987
You arrived earlier then me?

322
00:37:55,678 --> 00:37:58,071
You Rockstar shouldn't
come earlier.

323
00:37:58,071 --> 00:38:01,318
The late the hero arrives,
the more will be the craze.

324
00:38:03,946 --> 00:38:05,996
What happened?
Why are you looking like that?

325
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:07,991
Again did that
interview girl came?

326
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:10,096
Did she again irratated you..?

327
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:13,728
Again she tried to use you?

328
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:17,747
I swear.
I'll Kill her.

329
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:25,461
Lets order the coffee.

330
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:28,312
Lets have the coffee and
make your dream true.

331
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:29,613
I feel like an angel.

332
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:38,535
Actually... I don't know...whether
we can find here coffee or not

333
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:41,053
But in first meet, beer
won't be good, right?

334
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:43,175
That's why I said coffee.
Sorry.

335
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:44,300
Anyway I'll try for it.

336
00:38:54,146 --> 00:38:57,254
I'm the real one.
You don't have to test on me.

337
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,359
But your touch is wonderful.

338
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:01,992
What?
Yet you don't believe me?

339
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:02,882
Wait...

340
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:05,353
Am I hot?

341
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:10,989
Did you see that? They don't
even want to disturb us.

342
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:12,747
I feel like an angel.

343
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:02,885
Where are you going?

344
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:05,478
So you are imagining swimming?

345
00:40:05,478 --> 00:40:07,579
Please Please Please imagine
both of us swimming together...

346
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,749
It would be good.

347
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:10,215
Lets make that too true.

348
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:11,141
What? Ok?

349
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,904
First drink the coffee.

350
00:40:14,674 --> 00:40:16,151
What the hell?

351
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:17,743
Bloody bastard. Are
you blind or what?

352
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:19,265
Are you driving drinking
alchol or what?

353
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:22,622
Bloody dog.
Stupid Jackass

354
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:24,886
Do you think this beach as
your father's property?

355
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:26,501
Bloody drunkard.

356
00:40:26,706 --> 00:40:28,167
Oh shit. My coffe is gone.

357
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,517
Shall I bring another coffee?

358
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:46,931
What Sameera? Suddenly you
claim yourself too be hot.

359
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,951
Do you know I
became like a dumb.

360
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:53,323
Looking at the hot girls you boys become dumb.
That's why I asked you.

361
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,645
How's my double acting?

362
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:05,048
I did well, right?

363
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:09,920
Journalist looks general but
Angel looks mindblowing.

364
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,185
What is this? I thought you getting Rockstar
is hard but he is easily fell on you.

365
00:41:15,185 --> 00:41:16,301
What are you watching?

366
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:18,471
How does Angel changes her
dress, I'm looking that.

367
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:19,827
What?
-Dress change???

368
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:28,513
Why did you record this?

369
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:30,598
To increase the TRP for
your double acting.

370
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:33,095
Why are you beating me?

371
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:34,357
Did TRP increase now?

372
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:35,629
Stupid.

373
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:38,630
What's the Gautam
program tomorrow?

374
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:05,052
What Sir? After seeing me too
why are walking so silently?

375
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:08,099
Rather than staying free,
can't you give the interview?

376
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:12,396
It's me Angel.

377
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:15,671
You believed me that I'm
interview girl, right?

378
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:17,260
Last time you missed
the coffe, right?

379
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,628
This Angel will go and bring the coffee.
Till then you watch them and enjoy.

380
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:27,400
I forgot something. I think I didn't come to
GOA just to have only coffe with you, right?

381
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,218
Then why I'm here for?

382
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,226
What?

383
00:42:35,904 --> 00:42:38,449
It means I Love You
in Kokani language.

384
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:39,642
I really like you.

385
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:42,038
If you catch me right now then
its means NO from your side.

386
00:42:42,038 --> 00:42:43,955
If not then it means
YES from your side.

387
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,033
If you don't catch me now then this
Angel will not leave you forever.

388
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:51,210
No.

389
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,494
What "No"?

390
00:42:52,494 --> 00:42:53,882
Right now you said that...

391
00:42:53,882 --> 00:42:55,255
Awww Tuzo Moh Karta
(I Love You).

392
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:56,111
What do you mean?

393
00:42:56,111 --> 00:42:57,958
As you said I Love
you in Konkani.

394
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,805
Excuse me.
Will you leave my hands please?

395
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:01,053
I'm saying to you?

396
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:03,812
Mr. Gautam. Why do you
visualize so cheap about me?

397
00:43:03,812 --> 00:43:06,136
When I call for the treat,
you presuppose it as treat

398
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:08,330
You presume saying me I Love
You when I walk near by you.

399
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,287
What is your next plan?

400
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,659
Will you visualize
our dating or what?

401
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:13,426
Anyway you won't give
me the interview.

402
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:16,977
At least I want to cover it from a distant.
Won't you let me to do that too peacefully?

403
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:21,558
Mr. Gautam don't visualize that every girls from
India will express their love to Rockstars like you

404
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:24,618
We journalists come for
interviews not for dates.

405
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,529
Actually I really
expressed my love to you

406
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:40,823
But I can't tolerate no from you so
acted right now as interview girl.

407
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:45,253
Grils coming and expressing their
love to a Rockstar like you

408
00:43:45,253 --> 00:43:47,925
And you rejecting them
may common to you.

409
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:52,130
But for normal girl like
me its a major issue.

410
00:43:52,686 --> 00:43:54,444
I really like you.

411
00:43:54,828 --> 00:43:57,303
At least give me a chance to
become your one day girl friend.

412
00:43:57,411 --> 00:43:59,472
I'll keep it for my
life long memory.

413
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:01,430
You are not real.

414
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,472
You are just fictional.

415
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:04,588
No no no. I'm genuine.

416
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:05,708
You want me to prove it?

417
00:44:13,457 --> 00:44:15,954
Everybody will envision me as mentle
if I keep talking with you.

418
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,017
I know you are not really here.

419
00:44:18,017 --> 00:44:19,901
I'm just imagining you.
That's all.

420
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:20,728
Go.

421
00:44:20,728 --> 00:44:21,393
Go.

422
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:29,566
How do you know that
I'm just fictional?

423
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,583
If you were real then you
won't be here bringing coffee.

424
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:32,938
You'll be talking angrily.

425
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:33,449
What?

426
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:36,293
You all men are alike.

427
00:44:36,293 --> 00:44:39,097
They think our love as
fictitiuos and anger as real.

428
00:44:39,097 --> 00:44:41,335
Is this angerness enough
to prove me as real?

429
00:44:41,335 --> 00:44:43,401
Or do I've murder someone?

430
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:45,296
Just...just 2 minutes...

431
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:46,836
I'm giving you 120 seconds time.

432
00:44:46,836 --> 00:44:50,198
I'll go and jump into the sea if you don't
take me as your one day girl friend.

433
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,382
Is there... Is there a girl?

434
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:08,120
White dress?
-Ya

435
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,468
Yes, she is there.

436
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,858
One minute?
-Yes.

437
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:16,412
Are there two old
peoples in the table?

438
00:45:17,206 --> 00:45:18,592
Yaa they are having biscuits.

439
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,794
They are there, right?
-Yes

440
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,512
You'll die if you jump.

441
00:45:28,414 --> 00:45:30,766
I'm just fictitiuos.
How'll I die?

442
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:32,705
No. You are in real.
I know it.

443
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,298
Really? How did you know?

444
00:45:37,306 --> 00:45:39,613
The two old people
sitting there told me.

445
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:43,008
Who?

446
00:45:43,008 --> 00:45:44,173
No one is there.

447
00:46:44,425 --> 00:46:46,836
Rockstar Gautam interestingly
looking at rubbish.

448
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:49,856
What Sir? Are you imagining
something in here?

449
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,441
He is in Real.

450
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,948
He is right somewhere here?
-Who?

451
00:46:52,948 --> 00:46:55,503
Oh! The one you
killed in Hyderbad?

452
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:57,182
He too came GOA along with you?

453
00:46:57,182 --> 00:47:00,509
I've seen him throwing this CAN.
This is enough to prove him real.

454
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:01,638
Excuse me.

455
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:06,312
This one is also real.

456
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:09,927
This is GOA Sir. Its very
common to have such CAN.

457
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,716
This CAN might be common
but he's not common.

458
00:47:11,716 --> 00:47:14,516
He has Mongolian face
with pony tail hair.

459
00:47:14,516 --> 00:47:16,717
He is apprearing in same pony
tail hair since my childhood.

460
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:18,736
Thats not his hair style
but Mongolian cutom.

461
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:19,870
Russian Mafia.

462
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:23,029
No need to search
him all around.

463
00:47:23,029 --> 00:47:24,625
Just GOA is enough to find him.

464
00:47:24,835 --> 00:47:29,066
Instead of thinking him and wasting
time, you can give your interview???

465
00:47:29,066 --> 00:47:30,201
One day girl friend?

466
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:31,640
Interview?

467
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,585
One day girl friend?
Interview?

468
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:35,030

But I ask "How am I?"

475

How am I?

476
00:52:35,724 --> 00:52:36,603
Same?

477

479
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:41,404
Funny.

480
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:45,551
Instead of asking who am I,
you asking me who are you?

481
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:46,958
You too do joke.

482
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:49,182
I've seen my killing
episode in TV.

483
00:52:49,182 --> 00:52:51,159

484
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,026
Thank God...

485
00:52:53,026 --> 00:52:55,804
I was not there, so its ok.

486
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:58,616
If not, you've killed me so brutely.

487
00:52:58,616 --> 00:53:00,451
Thinking that too makes
me so scared.

488
00:53:00,451 --> 00:53:02,451
Who are my parents?

489
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:05,125
Why do you killed them?

490
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:08,321
I thought of killing you
before you aks me that.

491
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:11,146
The  dash in the
beach...the boat...

492
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,493
These are not the accidents.

493
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:15,840
These are my plans to kill you.

494
00:53:16,105 --> 00:53:17,677
But... missed.

495
00:53:18,547 --> 00:53:19,932
As like your childhood.

496
00:53:20,482 --> 00:53:23,091
This time without any plans

497
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:25,320
Get ready to die from my hands...

498
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,240
Hello Rockstar...

499
00:53:27,632 --> 00:53:31,293
Are you here?
I'm searching you all over the market.

500
00:53:31,293 --> 00:53:34,491
Are you angry with me coz
I sang song in your tune.

501
00:53:34,986 --> 00:53:37,547
What a timing your
girl friend has?

502

That time she appread
while you killing me.

503
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,449
Now she is coming while
I'm going to kill you.

504
00:53:44,456 --> 00:53:46,297
Is she recording this too?

505
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:48,555
No... no no no...

506
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,726
I don't like to
have proof system.

507
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:52,194
I don't leave any proofs.

508
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:15,051
What? Will you kill me?

509
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,483
Will you kill me if I want to be
your girl friend for one day?

510
00:54:29,676 --> 00:54:33,732
Its me... Looking good
scene around I came here.

511
00:54:40,605 --> 00:54:42,481
How many hours does it works?

512
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:45,576
One bottle cap works for an
hour and full for whole day.

01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:40,871
How come we here?

524
01:01:41,437 --> 01:01:42,865
What happened to the yatch?

525
01:01:43,509 --> 01:01:44,325
Gautam

526
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,570
What happened to your yatch?

527
01:01:45,595 --> 01:01:48,450
Somebody put fire in the yatch.

528
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:51,250
They again attacked us.
We excaped from the boat.

529
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,261
Due to fire in that
too, we came here.

530
01:01:53,515 --> 01:01:55,601
Who saw the men putting
fire in the yatch?

531
01:01:55,601 --> 01:01:56,330
Its me.

532
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,564
Who chase them?
-Its me.

533
01:01:57,564 --> 01:01:59,178
Who cut the rope?

534
01:01:59,823 --> 01:02:01,100
That too is you.

535
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:04,351
Do I tell you what happened?

536
01:02:04,351 --> 01:02:06,571
You imagined someone
putting fire in the yatch.

537
01:02:06,571 --> 01:02:08,824
You cut the rope and
made me fly in the air.

538
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:10,833
After that you imagined
someone chasing us.

539
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,950
At last, you imagined
boat to be in fire and came here.

540
01:02:15,234 --> 01:02:18,009
Mr. Gautam. We didn't came here
because somebody attacked us

541
01:02:18,009 --> 01:02:20,072
We are here coz you
imagined that.

542
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:21,398
What I'm saying is true.

543
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:24,328
What you are saying is not real.
And me too is not real.

544
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:24,890
Sameera.

545
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:27,222
Sameera is not here. You are
just imagining her. Thats all.

546
01:02:59,788 --> 01:03:01,882
Don't you know the
meaning of privacy?

547
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:03,536
Where ever you go
and disturb us.

548
01:03:04,136 --> 01:03:06,052
You arrived so soon.

549
01:03:06,052 --> 01:03:07,529
Actually I didn't
expect you to come.

550
01:03:28,145 --> 01:03:29,748
Its me shouting for you.

551
01:03:29,748 --> 01:03:31,001
Won't you talk with me?

552
01:03:31,001 --> 01:03:32,137
Will you just stay right here?

553
01:03:32,137 --> 01:03:33,182
That boat too left.

554
01:03:33,182 --> 01:03:35,118
Passing boats will
not care about us.

555
01:03:35,118 --> 01:03:37,734
Fishing boats will
be here tomorrow.

556
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:40,203
Just stay one day
in this Island.

557
01:03:40,203 --> 01:03:41,155
You and me.

558
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:43,928
I seems your "one day girl friend"
wish will be fulfilled today.

559
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:49,411
Seriously. Will you accept me
as your one day girl friend?

560
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:50,610
But you are fictitious, right?

561
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:52,749
Who said that?
-You...yourself

562
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:54,508
No..No.. I'm in real.

563
01:03:56,735 --> 01:03:58,184
Sit down.

564
01:03:59,122 --> 01:04:00,069
Stand up.

565
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:02,941
Run in the water.

566
01:04:10,786 --> 01:04:13,867
That it. Whatever I'm imagining,
you are doing the same.

567
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:14,773
You are fictitious.

568
01:04:16,575 --> 01:04:18,957
No.. no..no.. I'm just doing
what you're saying me to do.

569
01:04:18,957 --> 01:04:21,738
Exactly I thought of
saying that and you did.

570
01:04:23,243 --> 01:04:24,155
No...

571
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:25,689
If you want then say again.

572
01:04:25,689 --> 01:04:26,895
I'll prove me as real.

573
01:04:30,273 --> 01:04:31,887
Kiss me.

574
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:36,630
Hug me.

575
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:43,075
You are not doing as I said.

576
01:04:43,614 --> 01:04:46,019
That means I'm imagining
that interview girl.

577
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:49,019
One day girl friend will've
done whatever I said.

578
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:53,262
Tightly.

579
01:05:08,096 --> 01:05:10,864
I thought that looking at
the romantic scene. Sorry.

580
01:05:10,864 --> 01:05:11,977
I'm imagining you.

581
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,467
I'm fictitious.
I accept that.

582
01:05:17,467 --> 01:05:19,775
Will you accept me as
your one day girl friend?

583
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:56,824
I'm so happy.

584
01:05:56,824 --> 01:05:59,317
I didn't thought you will
express your love to me.

585
01:06:02,086 --> 01:06:04,314
You wantonly played
with me, right?

586
01:06:04,314 --> 01:06:05,751
You know I'm in real, right?

587
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:07,405
I know you are real.

588
01:06:07,502 --> 01:06:09,616
But I had to know interview
girl as fictitious, right?

589
01:06:09,616 --> 01:06:10,963
Then what should we do?

590
01:06:11,608 --> 01:06:13,372
Then I've to take your interview.

591
01:06:13,372 --> 01:06:17,159
It that so? Ok ok. Rockstar
interviewing a jorunalist.

592
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,851
Amazing. Nice TRP item. come on.

593
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:21,948
What's your name?

594
01:06:21,948 --> 01:06:23,163
You know that.

595
01:06:23,163 --> 01:06:24,064
Its interview.

596
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:24,905
Sameera.

597
01:06:24,905 --> 01:06:26,826
What do you do?
-I'm a journalist.

598
01:06:26,826 --> 01:06:27,993
What's your covered best news?

599
01:06:27,993 --> 01:06:30,617
Best news... to record
your murder scene.

600
01:06:30,617 --> 01:06:32,506
Sorry. Recording
Gautam murder news.

601
01:06:32,506 --> 01:06:34,685
I got famous from that.

602
01:06:34,685 --> 01:06:36,685
I lost my name(fame).

603
01:06:36,787 --> 01:06:40,194
Do Gautam has the past?
-No. He's just presumming it.

604
01:06:40,194 --> 01:06:41,475
What else did he assume?

605
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:44,256
Many things. He is imagining
the interview girl too.

606
01:06:44,256 --> 01:06:46,498
That means interview girl is not real?
-Yeah

607
01:06:50,378 --> 01:06:53,297
This camera says that interview
girl is not fictitious.

608
01:06:58,441 --> 01:07:00,379
How much are they giving you?

609
01:07:00,379 --> 01:07:01,727
For telecasting this news.

610
01:07:02,807 --> 01:07:05,918
You are the first person
so close to my life.

611
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:09,221
I thought you loved me?

612
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:11,519
It would've been good
if your love was true.

613
01:07:12,109 --> 01:07:13,737
Don't play with me onwards.

614
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:18,531
I have my past and
that's the reality.

615
01:07:18,531 --> 01:07:22,118
No one can make it
fasify. You too can't.

616
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:33,354
You acted loving me. But don't
act like being in pain.

617
01:07:35,423 --> 01:07:37,959
It would've been good if
you're really fictitious.

618
01:08:08,611 --> 01:08:11,819
I'm the first person to
believe you having your past.

619
01:08:12,826 --> 01:08:15,017
I searched for your past.

620
01:08:15,017 --> 01:08:19,367
Nearly 20 years back, Inspector Maule
joined that boy here.

621
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:21,088
I too don't remember properly

622
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:23,001
I found alone him in the forest.

623
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:26,279
He used to cry saying his
parents were murdered.

624
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:29,012
After inquiring, nothing like that.

625
01:08:29,012 --> 01:08:32,278
He is first boy to run away
from our orpanage home.

626
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:33,606
Thats why I remembered him.

627
01:08:33,606 --> 01:08:35,403
But I didn't any proof.

628
01:08:37,173 --> 01:08:38,897
Why I did this all, you know?

629
01:08:38,897 --> 01:08:41,799
He strongly believes
that he has his past.

630
01:08:41,799 --> 01:08:46,547
He just keep on imagining
only those three. Not others.

631
01:08:46,547 --> 01:08:48,547
We can't do anything about that.

632
01:08:48,556 --> 01:08:49,738
Then what can we do doctor?

633
01:08:49,827 --> 01:08:50,914
I'll tell you one

634
01:08:50,914 --> 01:08:54,959
If we can prove that he
imagine other people too then

635
01:08:54,959 --> 01:08:56,465
we can treat him.

636
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,000
But thats impossible.

637
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,182
Thats impossible.

638
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,906
No Doctor...
Its possible.

639
01:09:04,171 --> 01:09:06,310
Thats why I acted as two people.

640
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:11,443
Whatever happened between us, if that
were real then how happy would I've been

641
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:14,286
But in proving your reality
my love, became a lie.

642
01:09:14,286 --> 01:09:15,870
Which I couldn't bear.

643
01:09:19,478 --> 01:09:22,329
So, its a recored
failure love story.

644
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:26,997
Whatever happened between us in real,
turned to be fictional would've been good

645
01:09:27,716 --> 01:09:30,118
Sorry Gautam.
Good Bye.

646
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:03,376
Sameera...

647
01:11:03,376 --> 01:11:05,186
Is this real?
-What happened?

648
01:11:05,186 --> 01:11:07,226
Is this in real or not?
-Yes Gautam. So what?

649
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:08,538
That means attack too is real.

650
01:11:09,693 --> 01:11:11,966
Gautam. Listen to me?

651
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:15,139
You don't have any past.
You are just presumming that.

652
01:11:15,139 --> 01:11:18,607
As long as you don't believe that,
attacks on you keep on happening.

653
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,090
That is what I'm saying too.

654
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,309
That attack was not
for me but for you.

655
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:27,712
They are trying to kill you.
-So you are imagining like that now.

656
01:11:27,712 --> 01:11:29,546
Car accident, boat
accident, yatch attack...

657
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:31,137
That too happened when
you where there...

658
01:11:31,137 --> 01:11:32,759
What they want is you not me.

659
01:11:32,759 --> 01:11:35,387
Why do they want to kill me?
I don't have any enemy.

660
01:11:35,387 --> 01:11:36,999
They woul've killed
me if they wanted to.

661
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:38,497
They wouldn't have left me.

662
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:40,129
They are coming for you Sameera.

663
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,967
Its not safe to stay here.
 Come.

664
01:11:42,342 --> 01:11:43,718
You know what?

665
01:11:43,718 --> 01:11:46,171
Real or Fictitious,
thats not your problem.

666
01:11:46,752 --> 01:11:48,639
Untrust.

667
01:11:48,996 --> 01:11:52,706
You'll have believed
me, if you'd loved me.

668
01:11:53,582 --> 01:11:55,100
I Love You.

669
01:11:56,032 --> 01:11:57,567
I Love You.

670
01:11:59,173 --> 01:12:01,025
Enough?

671
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,509
Do you believe me now?

672
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:07,210
I believe you Gautam.
I Love You too.

673
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:08,222
Two minutes...

674
01:12:08,687 --> 01:12:10,284
I'll just change
my dress and come.

Happy Birthday Sameera.

682
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:45,134
We came to give you surprise
but Gautam gave us surprise.

683
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,468
I didn't thought they
were your friends.

684
01:16:55,468 --> 01:16:57,326
I thought they were
there to attack you.

685
01:16:57,369 --> 01:16:59,837
Sorry Sameera.
This won't repeat again.

686

I'm saying Sorry.

Happy Birthday Sammera.

688
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,345
Please Gautam leave me.

689
01:17:09,901 --> 01:17:11,193
Just go away from here.

690
01:17:17,406 --> 01:17:19,517
What you said is
correct Sameera.

691
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:22,924
Nobody attacked you.
All were my imaginations.

692
01:17:22,924 --> 01:17:26,418
Sameera...
I'll change...Sameera.

693
01:17:26,418 --> 01:17:29,675
Sameera... I'll change.

694
01:17:31,518 --> 01:17:33,862
Who cares if you change or not?

695
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:35,365
Whats the relationship between us?

696
01:17:35,365 --> 01:17:36,185
Sameera I Love You.

01:17:38,603 --> 01:17:41,477
Is this the reality?
Do you know what you are saying real?

698
01:17:41,477 --> 01:17:42,379
Sameera... that is...

699
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:50,809
I can't trust you Gautam.
You won't change.

700
01:17:50,904 --> 01:17:52,281
Stop Sameera.

701
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:53,963
What should I say to
make you trust me?

702
01:17:53,963 --> 01:17:55,587
How can I make you believe me?

703
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:58,155
Fine. Your past fictitious.
You don't have your parents.

704
01:17:58,155 --> 01:18:00,394
All is that your imagination.
Do you accept that?

705
01:18:06,025 --> 01:18:07,802
I accept that Sameera.

706
01:18:08,774 --> 01:18:12,122
I don't have my past nor
do I've my parents.

707
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:15,758
If I don't come out now
from this falsity then

708
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,800
I can't ever come out from this.

709
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,924
In the sorrow of having no one,
I pressumed them to be killed.

710
01:18:21,924 --> 01:18:25,800
In the fear of losing you, I'm pressuming
someone trying to attack you right now too...

711
01:18:27,219 --> 01:18:28,857
That all is fictional.

712
01:18:28,857 --> 01:18:30,561
All is just created only by me.

713
01:18:39,192 --> 01:18:41,459
Gautam...

714
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:47,210
Right now too, I'm imagining someone
trying to stab knife in your neck Sameera.

715
01:18:47,499 --> 01:18:49,715
Look I'm not reacting anymore.

716
01:18:49,715 --> 01:18:51,011
They are staring at me Sameera.

717
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:53,446
There are other people
behind him too Sameera.

718
01:18:53,446 --> 01:18:55,212
I'm scared they might kill you.

719
01:18:55,212 --> 01:18:57,374
Look I'm not doing anything.
Believe me.

720
01:19:04,214 --> 01:19:05,684
Look they are
beating me Sameera.

721
01:19:05,684 --> 01:19:07,153
Yet I'm not doing anything.

722
01:20:05,982 --> 01:20:07,980
Whether its reality or not...

723
01:20:09,157 --> 01:20:11,242
I can't bear if anything
happens to you Sameera.

724
01:20:16,383 --> 01:20:18,205
Sorry Gautam...

725
01:20:27,654 --> 01:23:00,142
<b><i>Ram</i></b>

726
01:23:06,216 --> 01:23:07,404
Who are you?

727
01:23:08,058 --> 01:23:10,156
Why are you trying
to kill Sameera?

728
01:23:10,156 --> 01:23:12,288
Why are you trying to kill her?

729
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:13,511
Tell me.

730
01:23:15,668 --> 01:23:16,963
Tell me.

731
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:19,287
Tell me...

732
01:23:19,312 --> 01:23:21,180
Gautam...

733
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:23,451
Leave him.

734
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:26,358
I know who they are.

735
01:23:32,803 --> 01:23:35,121
What is that you urgently
want to talk with me?

736
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,032
Some one is trying
to kill me Sir.

737
01:23:37,032 --> 01:23:38,904
There are attacks
happening on me.

738
01:23:38,904 --> 01:23:40,213
Are you sure?
-Yes Sir.

739
01:23:40,554 --> 01:23:41,562
Do you remember that?

740
01:23:41,562 --> 01:23:47,807
2 months before I did a program to prove the
effects of seeds from A-Jeevan's company

741
01:23:47,813 --> 01:23:53,911
Actually my friends who proved Hydrogen
Cyanide in that seeds is a GOA's best INGOs active member.

742
01:23:53,911 --> 01:23:57,202
Recently when I called him when I
were in GOA but he didn't answer

743
01:23:57,202 --> 01:24:00,375
After that, it came to news that
he died in some boat accident.

744
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:03,014
But before his death,
he'd called me

745
01:24:03,014 --> 01:24:07,593
Saying A-Jeevan cheif called him
to discuss about this matter.

746
01:24:07,593 --> 01:24:11,463
I'm the only one person to
know that he went there.

747
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:16,047
When he died the day after
calling me, I got the doubt

748
01:24:16,047 --> 01:24:18,730
and inquired about the A-Jeevan chief.

749
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:22,393
Correctly after that attacks
are happening on me.

750
01:24:22,393 --> 01:24:24,768
That means that's not
an accident Sir.

751
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:26,064
It was a pre-plan murder Sir.

752
01:24:26,306 --> 01:24:30,969
Fearing about the truth coming
out, he too is trying to kill me.

753
01:24:33,925 --> 01:24:35,915
His name is Antonio Rosarios.

754
01:24:33,925 --> 01:24:35,567
Its his photo Sir.

755
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:36,455
Have a look.

756
01:24:37,266 --> 01:24:38,955
Did anyone come with you?

757
01:24:38,955 --> 01:24:41,318
Gautam Sir. He is waiting
in the lobby outside.

758
01:24:42,025 --> 01:24:44,314
Do Gautam know this?
-No Sir.

759
01:24:44,314 --> 01:24:47,560
I thought informing you 1st as this
is related to the channel subjects.

760
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:54,211
I lied him saying that this is due to
the investigate that I did in the old city

761
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:07,250
Don't tell... Not only
to Gautam but to anyone.

762
01:25:08,309 --> 01:25:09,658
What are you saying Sir?

763
01:25:11,056 --> 01:25:16,016
The same person Antonio Rosarios who
was a criminal in GOA

764
01:25:16,016 --> 01:25:19,357
Now he is a A-Jeevan Seeds
company's chief, mafia king

765
01:25:19,357 --> 01:25:20,882
5 minutes before, he came here.

766
01:25:21,463 --> 01:25:23,180
Armani Suit

767
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:24,921
Ray ban glass

768
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:26,130
Pony tail.

769
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:27,968
cut in the face...

770
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:36,007
Again he came.

771
01:25:36,007 --> 01:25:40,433
He is fearing that his political career
might get destroy because of this.

772
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:44,863
Its for the news and reporter.
50 cores for me.

773
01:25:45,755 --> 01:25:47,628
He said he'll let you to live.

774
01:25:48,613 --> 01:25:50,301
what if I go against him?

775
01:25:51,627 --> 01:25:53,185
You'll die and I too will die.

776
01:25:55,185 --> 01:25:58,219
Seynore Seynoria
 ("How am I"? in Mongolian langugage)

777
01:26:01,847 --> 01:26:03,221
Are you shocked?

778
01:26:05,918 --> 01:26:07,793
This is the advantages
of pressuming.

779
01:26:08,297 --> 01:26:11,342
Every time you taking out the gun...
its becoming boring.

780
01:26:11,342 --> 01:26:12,767
Small change...

781
01:26:12,904 --> 01:26:14,264
How is it?

782
01:26:15,308 --> 01:26:16,354
Sit down.

783
01:26:19,158 --> 01:26:21,264
Right now I'm not pressumig
any chair for you.

784
01:26:21,264 --> 01:26:22,134
Sit down.

785
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:26,946
Fictitious

786
01:26:27,311 --> 01:26:28,725
I know you are not in real.

787
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:32,180
Sameera told me that.

788
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:35,711
She proved that I
don't have any past.

789
01:26:35,711 --> 01:26:37,757
My past is falsity means you
too is not real, right?

790
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:40,227
Shhhh... don't talk.
Stay calm.

791
01:26:40,794 --> 01:26:43,148
I'll believe you to
be real if you talk.

792
01:26:43,813 --> 01:26:45,311
I only talk.

793
01:26:49,403 --> 01:26:52,575
But Sameera don't like talking
with you in my imagination.

794
01:26:55,304 --> 01:26:57,663
She has started believing
me thinking I'm changing.

795
01:26:58,483 --> 01:27:01,238
For her to believe that I
totally has changed then

796
01:27:02,058 --> 01:27:04,063
I've to stop pressuming you.

797
01:27:04,116 --> 01:27:05,606
I've to kill you.

798
01:27:10,807 --> 01:27:13,356
Doctor gave me this tablets.

799
01:27:14,192 --> 01:27:16,353
Said you'll disappear
if I take this.

800
01:27:16,353 --> 01:27:17,778
that I won't see you again.

801
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:22,076
But I feel pain if you dissappear.

802
01:27:22,076 --> 01:27:24,663
You are here means my
parents too were there.

803
01:27:24,663 --> 01:27:26,053
I'll have my past.

804
01:27:26,053 --> 01:27:27,914
If you are not then
I'll become orphan.

805
01:27:27,914 --> 01:27:30,244
It would've been good
if you were real.

806
01:27:30,725 --> 01:27:32,301
But you are not...

807
01:27:32,884 --> 01:27:33,942
Just die.

808
01:27:35,599 --> 01:27:38,650
You don't know why I'm
trying to kill you, right?

809
01:27:38,865 --> 01:27:40,600
Then I've to tell you my story.

810
01:27:42,908 --> 01:27:44,878
20 years back in GOA

811
01:27:45,272 --> 01:27:47,513
It says me with my parents
travelling in the bus.

812
01:27:47,943 --> 01:27:49,472
Story says three villians came.

813
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:51,002
One them, it says
you were the one.

814
01:27:51,422 --> 01:27:53,508
Says you killed my parents.

815
01:27:53,787 --> 01:27:55,007
Says I ran from there.

816
01:27:55,212 --> 01:27:57,476
Till then, story says you
have been trying to kill me

817
01:27:57,476 --> 01:28:00,678
Before I come and kill you, you
want to kill me, Says my story.

818
01:28:00,678 --> 01:28:01,868
This is my story.

819
01:28:02,934 --> 01:28:04,326
Revenge Story.

820
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:05,434
How is it?

821
01:28:06,745 --> 01:28:08,481
This all is not
necessary for us.

822
01:28:09,234 --> 01:28:12,129
Doctor says, if take this tablets, you'll disapper.

823
01:28:12,477 --> 01:28:16,454
What I say is, before taking this tablets,
I want to kill you by this bullets.

824
01:28:16,454 --> 01:28:19,581
Revenge Story, Right? It would
get the commercial ending.

825
01:28:19,581 --> 01:28:20,677
What do you say?

826
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:27,822
Why are you taking the breath?

827
01:28:28,006 --> 01:28:32,100
You are not alive coz you are breathing.
You are alive coz I'm imagining you.

828
01:28:34,718 --> 01:28:37,351
Ok. Last choice?
Do you want to say anything?

829
01:28:38,161 --> 01:28:40,783
Its ok, you can tell. I'm
giving you the permission.

830
01:28:40,783 --> 01:28:42,120
Tell me.

831
01:28:42,845 --> 01:28:44,004
I'm in real.

832
01:28:44,004 --> 01:28:45,567
I'm Real.

833
01:29:01,617 --> 01:29:04,156
That what I'm saying to everyone
but nobody is believing me.

834
01:29:04,156 --> 01:29:05,981
Anyway you believed
that you are Real.

835
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:12,756
What happened?
I heard some sound.

836
01:29:12,756 --> 01:29:13,710
I Killed him.

837
01:29:14,584 --> 01:29:15,991
I killed that pony tail.

838
01:29:16,324 --> 01:29:17,992
Now he'll not dare
to come in my dream.

839
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:22,746
Sond shouldn't have come?

840
01:29:38,398 --> 01:29:42,302
Is he in reality?
Sameera is he in reality?

841
01:29:43,996 --> 01:29:46,662
Is he in reality?
Sameera is he in reality?

842
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,564
He is real Sameera.

843
01:29:59,564 --> 01:30:01,815
If he is real means
I've my past Sameera.

844
01:30:01,947 --> 01:30:03,941
I do had my parents Sameera.

845
01:30:03,941 --> 01:30:06,390
If he is real means remaining
two are also real Sameera.

846
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:07,437
He knows me Sameera.

847
01:30:08,098 --> 01:30:09,355
Wake up...wake up...

848
01:30:09,355 --> 01:30:10,701
Who am I?

849
01:30:10,701 --> 01:30:11,948
Who are my mother and father?

850
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:17,025
Why did you kill my parents?
Get up..get up...get up...

851
01:30:18,347 --> 01:30:20,718
Tell me...
He had told me he was real Sameera.

852
01:30:20,739 --> 01:30:22,046
Its me who didn't listen to him.

853
01:30:22,046 --> 01:30:24,100
who are the other two?
Wake up...

854
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:25,260
WAKE UP...

855
01:30:30,256 --> 01:30:33,402
He died Sameera...
He didn't say anything to me Sammera.

856
01:30:33,402 --> 01:30:36,610
He died Sameera.
He died saying nothing Sameera.

857
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,092
He died without saying
anything Sameera.

858
01:30:38,092 --> 01:30:39,791
I've killed him Sameera.

859
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:00,615
What shall we do now?

860
01:31:00,615 --> 01:31:04,707
Now two of them are remaining. After catching
them, the reality of my past will come out.

861
01:31:04,707 --> 01:31:07,276
What if its a coincidence?
I mean...

862
01:31:09,257 --> 01:31:12,043
The one you imagined and
him might looked same...

863
01:31:12,043 --> 01:31:14,367
May be he has no
connection with your past.

864
01:31:14,367 --> 01:31:16,112
Those three killed my parents.

865
01:31:16,112 --> 01:31:18,673
He is one of them.
I know it.

866
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:20,954
How can you say that?
We don't have any proofs.

867
01:31:20,954 --> 01:31:23,963
Do you remember the attack
before the night I went to Goa?

868
01:31:25,733 --> 01:31:27,073
Thats fictitious, right?

869
01:31:27,073 --> 01:31:29,298
From today onwards there won't be
any fictitious in my life Sameera.

870
01:31:29,298 --> 01:31:30,500

Got it.

874
01:32:42,696 --> 01:32:45,370
The photos are not clear.
Its difficult to identify them.

875
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:48,022
Go back.

876
01:32:51,264 --> 01:32:52,536
Zoom at the cell phone.

877
01:32:54,176 --> 01:32:54,984
Zoom at the screen.

878
01:32:58,218 --> 01:32:59,888
May be exposal problem.

879
01:33:00,688 --> 01:33:02,185
Zoom it.

880
01:33:25,173 --> 01:33:26,909
Total how many photos are there?

881
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:29,406
How many cell phone
photos are there?

882
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:30,676
May be 12.

883
01:33:30,676 --> 01:33:31,863
Save it.

884
01:33:33,555 --> 01:33:35,031
Play them at a time.

885
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:42,160
Play it again.

886
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,640
9..1...8...5...4

887
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:51,566
6...4...8...5...7

888
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:55,616
9185464857

889
01:34:02,706 --> 01:34:04,707
Pick up that phone.

890
01:34:22,018 --> 01:34:23,222
Hello...who are you?

891
01:34:23,222 --> 01:34:25,946
Thats what I'm
asking, "Who am I"?

892
01:34:34,482 --> 01:34:36,562
Who are my mother and father?

893
01:34:38,831 --> 01:34:40,456
Why did you killed them?

894
01:34:41,156 --> 01:34:43,672
What is the relations
between you and other two?

895
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,506
Who is that third one?

896
01:34:46,506 --> 01:34:47,831
Just listen to me?

897
01:34:47,831 --> 01:34:49,451
Why are you trying to kill me?

898
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:53,070
Why are you trying to kill me?

899
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:55,686
If we had come to kill you then,
we would've come silently.

900
01:34:59,106 --> 01:35:02,182
had we came to kill you, why
would we come empty handed...

901
01:35:02,182 --> 01:35:05,483
 we would've attacked you
not only got beaten.

902
01:35:05,897 --> 01:35:09,700
Yes Gautam. I sent
them to talk with you.

903
01:35:10,222 --> 01:35:14,243
They are not the goons, they
are my company's cab drivers.

904
01:35:15,331 --> 01:35:17,515
After seeing your
story in the TV

905
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,955
I understood you looking
me too as villian.

906
01:35:19,955 --> 01:35:22,897
Thats why I sent them to
tell the truths about you.

907
01:35:22,897 --> 01:35:25,230
If you'd wanted that then
you'd had directly come.

908
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:27,548
 I didn't came thinking
you'd react like this.

909
01:35:28,153 --> 01:35:30,583
One who wasn't there, you
killed imagining him.

910
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:32,959
If I had come, thinking reality
you might have killed me.

911
01:35:33,975 --> 01:35:35,945
Anyway I did come
for you next day.

912
01:35:38,026 --> 01:35:40,047
But you left thinking
me as fictitious.

913
01:35:40,047 --> 01:35:42,571
Stop the car Gautam.

914
01:35:47,696 --> 01:35:49,598
20 years ago...

915
01:35:49,598 --> 01:35:51,602
I was a cab driver.

916
01:36:14,937 --> 01:36:17,210
Driver?
-Where do you want to go Sir?

917
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:18,567
Follow that bus.

918
01:36:29,331 --> 01:36:31,785
Where are you from Sir?
-London.

919
01:36:33,397 --> 01:36:35,213
London is my dream Sir.

920
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:38,343
Its said almost all cab drivers
Indian there, right Sir?

921
01:36:38,343 --> 01:36:42,479
I'm trying for the Visa. If you
help me then my life'll be settled.

922
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:44,901
ok ok...lets see...
Follow the bus.

923
01:36:53,994 --> 01:36:57,681
Not you Sir. Your stop is yet to come.
Sit down Sir.

924
01:37:07,308 --> 01:37:09,480
I'll be waiting you
in the car Sir.

925
01:37:28,606 --> 01:37:33,964
Gautam run....

926
01:37:34,935 --> 01:37:37,109
Run Gautam...
Shot him.

927
01:37:43,374 --> 01:37:44,663
Kill that boy too.

928
01:38:06,006 --> 01:38:07,727
What happened Sir?

929
01:38:13,232 --> 01:38:14,903
Gautam...

930
01:38:24,492 --> 01:38:26,143
Don't leave him.

931
01:38:26,143 --> 01:38:28,831
Sir..Sir...don't kill him Sir.
He is just a kid Sir.

932
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,662
Who are you son?

933
01:38:33,913 --> 01:38:35,048
Son

934
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,475
Here...They killed
my mother here.

935
01:38:57,475 --> 01:38:58,899
Here...they killed
my father here.

936
01:38:59,923 --> 01:39:01,555
This boy is always
like that Sir.

937
01:39:01,555 --> 01:39:04,003
He immediately gets into
whatever the bus stops here.

938
01:39:04,003 --> 01:39:06,676
and says "here they killed
my mother and here father".

939
01:39:08,976 --> 01:39:11,433
Driver and Conductor
there, was intellegent.

940
01:39:11,433 --> 01:39:15,435
They asked both when we asked for
them what they want, money or life.

941
01:39:15,621 --> 01:39:16,743
So what about you?

942
01:39:24,185 --> 01:39:26,183
He too is intellegent.

943
01:40:42,991 --> 01:40:45,152
This is mine. My
mom gave me this.

944
01:40:45,152 --> 01:40:48,901
How many times do I've to say you that you don't
have your parents. You're just imagining them.

945
01:40:49,069 --> 01:40:50,169
Go from here.

946
01:40:50,256 --> 01:40:51,691
This boy is always like that Sir.

947
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:53,777
He immediately gets into
whatever the bus stops here.

948
01:40:53,802 --> 01:40:56,943
and says "here they killed
my mother and here father".

949
01:40:56,943 --> 01:40:59,509
I've medical reports to prove
what you're saying is unreal.

950
01:40:59,509 --> 01:41:01,044
what do you have with you?

951
01:41:01,044 --> 01:41:03,291
why were you in the orphange
if you'd you parents?

952
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:20,547
Don't cry. Your mother is not in the village.
She'll come soon.

953
01:41:20,933 --> 01:41:27,104
I want my mother.
-Don't cry. She'll come.

954
01:41:28,944 --> 01:41:30,144
Don't cry.

955
01:41:30,405 --> 01:41:31,747
What are you saying?

956
01:41:31,747 --> 01:41:34,038
He's crying for his mother.
What can I say for the kid.

957
01:41:35,387 --> 01:41:37,594
Don't tell lie to children.

958
01:41:37,594 --> 01:41:41,801
If you then, he'll end up like me trying
differentiating the truth and falsity.

959
01:41:43,221 --> 01:41:44,321
mother...

960
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:48,893
What's your name dear?
-Chinna.

961
01:41:49,592 --> 01:41:52,754
Look at me Chinna.
Your mother is dead.

962
01:41:53,714 --> 01:41:55,157
She is gone forever.

963
01:41:57,645 --> 01:42:00,017
You've to live your whole
life believing this truth.

964
01:42:01,508 --> 01:42:03,714
Onwards you've to play
without your mom.

965
01:42:04,687 --> 01:42:06,494
you've to eat without your mom

966
01:42:07,001 --> 01:42:08,757
you've to grow on your own.

967
01:42:10,622 --> 01:42:12,025
sleep on your own.

968
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:14,253
you've to do everything
without mom.

969
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:16,294
mother...

970
01:42:18,505 --> 01:42:23,483
Mother...

971
01:42:26,788 --> 01:42:31,078
This is a belief that a
dying father gave to me.

972
01:42:32,002 --> 01:42:34,748
He wanted me to give
this to his son.

973
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:39,017
I took it as my
resposibilit to handle you.

974
01:42:39,017 --> 01:42:40,670
Now I'm at peace.

975
01:42:55,028 --> 01:42:56,802
Its just a key.

976
01:42:57,474 --> 01:42:59,150
No any clues are here.

977
01:43:01,664 --> 01:43:06,524
British coin...
1992

978
01:43:08,368 --> 01:43:10,285
Another is Rubik's cubes.

979
01:43:12,026 --> 01:43:13,994
I used to play with
this in my childhood.

980
01:43:13,994 --> 01:43:15,798
There is nothing
importance in this.

981
01:43:23,285 --> 01:43:25,634
Where are you Sir?

982
01:43:25,634 --> 01:43:27,853
I tried so many times
to contact you.

983
01:43:27,853 --> 01:43:29,452
Are you ok?
I need to talk about one thing.

984
01:43:29,452 --> 01:43:30,627
I'm coming to London.

985
01:43:31,356 --> 01:43:34,473
Why so suddenly?
Right now here is no any concert too.

986
01:43:34,473 --> 01:43:36,858
I'll come there and talk with you.
-Ok Gautam.

987
01:43:36,858 --> 01:43:38,054
Who is Michael?

988
01:43:38,054 --> 01:43:39,958
My concert manager of London.

989
01:43:40,676 --> 01:43:42,544
Whenever I go Lodon, he
used to take care of me.

990
01:43:43,216 --> 01:43:46,307
Looking at the coin of your father,
will you just go for London?

991
01:43:46,307 --> 01:43:49,098
I can't leave even a small things
that are related to my past.

992
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:51,984
As per the cab driver, the third
one too came from London.

993
01:43:51,984 --> 01:43:53,381
He is there Sameera.

994
01:43:54,198 --> 01:43:55,652
I too will come with you.

995
01:43:57,490 --> 01:43:58,573
No Sameera.

996
01:43:58,573 --> 01:44:00,316
I can't loose you too.

997
01:44:03,371 --> 01:44:06,389
You are leaving me behind only because
of the love you've on me, right?

998
01:44:07,309 --> 01:44:11,863
Ok. Before you leave, I want
to kiss you as a remeberence.

999
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,326
I want to hug just once.

1000
01:44:24,676 --> 01:44:26,204
Again one more hug.

1001
01:44:30,585 --> 01:44:31,515
Thank you.

1002
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:32,995
What are you doing Sameera?

1003
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:35,100
I'm talking with you.

1004
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:38,925
You can imagine talking
with me but I can't. Right?

1005
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,435
Now onwards I've to live
without you, right?

1006
01:44:41,435 --> 01:44:44,215
That's why I'm practicing
to imagine you.

1007
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:49,465
Come... Lets do again.

1008
01:44:49,465 --> 01:44:50,840
I'll just hug once.

1009
01:44:54,925 --> 01:44:56,425
Just again one kiss.

1010
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:03,100
Again one kiss.

1011
01:45:19,565 --> 01:47:59,558
<b>Subtitles by Nithin Prabhu</b>

1012
01:48:25,363 --> 01:48:27,223
Sorry Gautam. I couldn't
come right now.

1013
01:48:27,223 --> 01:48:28,568
I got in an important meeting.

1014
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:31,788
I've sent cab to the airport and
arranged everthing for you.

Are you here for Gautam?
-It's me Madam.

1019
01:48:47,453 --> 01:48:50,073
Why is there your name
instead of Gautam's?

1020
01:48:50,073 --> 01:48:53,313
Madam, Gautam Sir is a Rockstar.
Anyone will recongise him.

1021
01:48:53,313 --> 01:48:56,063
But Gautam Sir donot
recognise me, right?

1022
01:48:56,063 --> 01:48:58,358
That's why I put my name.

1023
01:48:58,358 --> 01:49:00,493
Mam, where is Gautam Sir?

1024
01:49:01,248 --> 01:49:02,363

Dudu...whose bag is in the lift?

1039
01:49:48,723 --> 01:49:50,248
That's mine.
-Go then.

1040
01:49:51,293 --> 01:49:52,183
Hey. My bag.

How many Sir's fans are there in London.

1043
01:50:00,208 --> 01:50:02,468
You're lucky madam. You
didn't see ladies fans there.

1044
01:50:02,468 --> 01:50:05,118
If then, they would've bite
Sir's check like an apple.

1045
01:50:06,028 --> 01:50:08,903
If you want to live then you've to
live like a star like our Sir, madam.

1046
01:50:08,903 --> 01:50:11,393
Madam, its all coz of his
parents good deeds.

1047
01:50:11,393 --> 01:50:13,718
They put guitar in our Sir's hand.

1048
01:50:13,718 --> 01:50:15,288
But mine put stiring in my hands.

1049
01:50:15,288 --> 01:50:18,498
That's why Dudu became
Rockstar and I ended as Rodstar.

1050
01:50:19,478 --> 01:50:21,373
I just play with stiring.

1051
01:50:21,403 --> 01:50:24,353
Hey Dad Mangal Singh,
I'll not forgive you.

1052
01:50:24,353 --> 01:50:26,028
Gulab Singh, do uoy have FM?

1053
01:50:26,603 --> 01:50:29,803
Madam, are you saying to shut up and drive?

1054
01:50:29,803 --> 01:50:31,103
But impossible.

1055
01:50:31,103 --> 01:50:33,608
Dudu always sing and I talk.

1056
01:50:34,458 --> 01:50:36,743
where can I find guns here?
-Guns?

1057
01:50:36,743 --> 01:50:41,068
I got it Dude. This time you're
using bullet sounds in the music.

1058
01:50:47,573 --> 01:50:49,948
I don't know the music
but too I'll sing.

1059
01:50:49,948 --> 01:50:52,238
This what I like doing
in my duty time.

1061
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:29,687
I'm scared Gautam.

1062
01:52:29,937 --> 01:52:31,917
I'm afraid if anything
may happens to you.

1063
01:52:31,917 --> 01:52:34,657
Lets go away from here. Please Gautam.
Please.

1064
01:52:36,922 --> 01:52:39,537
They did right thing by
trying to kill me, Sameera.

1065
01:52:40,287 --> 01:52:42,822
It's now confirmed that
the third one is here.

1066
01:52:44,577 --> 01:52:46,827
Till now I kept on
searching them.

1067
01:52:47,157 --> 01:52:49,112
But now they are searching for me.

1068
01:52:49,652 --> 01:52:51,707
We both are standing in
the same way.

1069
01:52:51,707 --> 01:52:53,017
Face to face.

1070
01:52:54,482 --> 01:52:55,952
I'll get him Sameera.

1071
01:52:57,027 --> 01:53:00,032
Dudu. I called Michael
but is switched off.

1072
01:53:00,032 --> 01:53:01,872
No any number is working Dudu.

1073
01:53:06,777 --> 01:53:08,477
Whats the relation
between you and Michael?

1074
01:53:08,477 --> 01:53:10,087
I don't have any
connection with him Dudu.

1075
01:53:10,087 --> 01:53:12,852
He is just my regular cutomer.
Keep calling only for the cab.

1076
01:53:12,852 --> 01:53:14,127
Do you know where is he?

1077
01:53:14,127 --> 01:53:18,397
He is out of my connection.
I don't know where he went.

1078
01:53:19,942 --> 01:53:22,142
That means do he have
connection with the attack?

1079
01:53:22,187 --> 01:53:24,377
Only Michael know
that we came here.

1080
01:53:25,907 --> 01:53:29,207
He didn't come to the airport.
Switched off the mobile after the attack.

1081
01:53:29,207 --> 01:53:31,962
That means he and that third
guy has the connections.

1082
01:53:32,262 --> 01:53:34,292
First we've to find Michael.

1083
01:53:34,292 --> 01:53:37,832
I don't know where he is Dudu.
But I know where he goes.

They've been hunting
me since my childhood.

1093
02:01:56,944 --> 02:02:00,139
I keep on remembering them in the
fear that they might kill me.

1094
02:02:00,734 --> 02:02:02,784
But I forgot how my
parents look like.

1095

I don't remember him.

1099
02:02:19,064 --> 02:02:22,139
I don't even remember their memory

When I'll get the murderers...
when will I kill them...

1103
02:02:38,029 --> 02:02:42,019
I killed them.
But all that became fictional.

1104
02:02:42,019 --> 02:02:45,064
That's not fictional Dudu.
You'll really kill them Dudu.

1105
02:02:45,064 --> 02:02:47,354
You'll definitely know
about your parents.

were always around me

1107
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:53,294
I'm that bloody who walked
without caring them.

1108
02:02:53,749 --> 02:02:55,984

don't even remember

you're struggling so
much for them means...

I became unable to catch
the one whom I found.

1112
02:03:06,964 --> 02:03:09,394
Though I'm near to catch them but
feel I'm going far from that.

02:15:52,321 --> 02:15:54,566
Because he wants me alive.

1212
02:15:54,581 --> 02:15:56,131
I need him.
Drop your gun.

1213
02:15:58,046 --> 02:15:59,131
Who are you?

1214
02:16:00,066 --> 02:16:01,181
Who sent you?

1215
02:16:03,807 --> 02:16:04,812
Where is he?

1216
02:16:05,652 --> 02:16:06,639
Gautam get in the car.

1217
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:08,869
I don't even know the name
of person who attacked me.

1218
02:16:08,869 --> 02:16:11,076
Get in the car Gautam.
Just wait one minute.

1219
02:16:11,751 --> 02:16:12,744
Who is he?

1220
02:16:22,269 --> 02:16:24,359
Who is he?
Tell me.

1221
02:16:24,359 --> 02:16:25,621
Who sent you?

1222
02:16:25,621 --> 02:16:27,046
I'll tell you Boss.

1223
02:16:30,541 --> 02:16:31,866
No. Don't tell him.

1224
02:16:31,866 --> 02:16:32,986
You'll die if you tell him.

1225
02:16:49,716 --> 02:16:52,166
This is the place where
you can find your answer.

1226
02:17:16,311 --> 02:17:18,791
I killed those three
who killed my parents.

1227
02:18:10,725 --> 02:18:14,705
When everyone is chasing
you, why are you after me?

1228
02:18:14,705 --> 02:18:15,675
What did I do...

1229
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:17,660
Gautam, what's this?

1230
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:21,320
Why did you killed my parents?

1231
02:18:21,655 --> 02:18:23,220
20 years ago.
-What are you saying?

1232
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:23,810
In Goa

1233
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:26,985
You were with other two.
Why did you killed?

1234
02:18:35,645 --> 02:18:38,220
What Boss?
Do you remembered?

1235
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:42,260
Among the three murders you thought
to be fictional, one was Real.

1236
02:18:44,505 --> 02:18:45,775
You killed him Boss.

1237
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:48,295
You really killed him.

1238
02:18:49,385 --> 02:18:51,245
Do you know whom you killed?

1239
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:53,730
My father, Boss.

1240
02:18:56,255 --> 02:18:57,550
My life Boss.

1241
02:18:57,850 --> 02:18:59,645
My Father was my life Boss.

1242
02:19:00,305 --> 02:19:02,655
I too is crazy about you.
About your song.

1243
02:19:03,905 --> 02:19:06,395
Look at this Boss.
Look.

1244
02:19:07,325 --> 02:19:09,895
I still kept your symbol with me
though I knew you killed my father.

1245
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:14,030
You killed such fan's father.

1246
02:19:17,371 --> 02:19:20,117
That's why Boss, I
wanted to kill you.

1247
02:19:20,117 --> 02:19:23,610
I came there in you Hyderbad concert
to kill you but got missed.

1248
02:19:24,685 --> 02:19:25,994
Till then I searched you.

1249
02:19:25,994 --> 02:19:28,042
Then I knew, you coming here.

1250
02:19:29,410 --> 02:19:30,277
I followed you.

1251
02:19:31,167 --> 02:19:34,067
I planned to kill you in bridge
when you were coming from airport.

1252
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:36,056
But again missed you.

1253
02:19:36,056 --> 02:19:38,254
Today too I came in police
station to kill you

1254
02:19:39,249 --> 02:19:40,465
Its paining Boss.

1255
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:43,720
Its paining that I might
die before killing you.

1256
02:19:53,621 --> 02:19:54,496
Kill me.

1257
02:19:55,271 --> 02:19:56,504
Kill me.
-Boss?

1258
02:19:58,132 --> 02:20:00,252
I know the pain of
loosing parents.

1259
02:20:01,077 --> 02:20:03,153
Whom I wanted to
kill, I killed them.

1260
02:20:03,153 --> 02:20:05,046
My revenge is finished.

1261
02:20:06,032 --> 02:20:07,360
Now remaining is yours revenge.

1262
02:20:09,093 --> 02:20:10,715
But one thing before killing.

1263
02:20:11,592 --> 02:20:14,555
Why did you kill Michael?
-Who is Michael, Boss?

1264
02:20:15,868 --> 02:20:17,511
That means you
didn't kill Michael?

1265
02:20:17,511 --> 02:20:19,226
Why do I kill him?

1266
02:20:20,430 --> 02:20:22,336
That means you
didn't come to bank?

1267
02:20:23,713 --> 02:20:25,239
That means you don't
want the box?

1268
02:21:00,336 --> 02:21:01,237
Pick up the phone.

1269
02:21:06,850 --> 02:21:09,385
20 years back, what's your
father's occupation in Goa?

1270
02:21:10,688 --> 02:21:12,060
Taxi driver.

1271
02:21:28,352 --> 02:21:29,925
Where are you from Sir?
-London.

1272
02:21:32,730 --> 02:21:33,978
London is my dream Sir.

1273
02:21:35,426 --> 02:21:36,380
Follow that bus.
Ok Sir.

1274
02:21:42,359 --> 02:21:44,230
Kill him too.

1275
02:22:01,109 --> 02:22:02,147
Don't kill him Sir.

1276
02:22:02,147 --> 02:22:03,938
he is just a kid.

1277
02:22:12,123 --> 02:22:14,473
You need Visa.
You need Vis, right?

1278
02:22:14,964 --> 02:22:16,671
He wants Visa, right?

1279
02:22:33,930 --> 02:22:36,018
Who told you that I
killed your father?

1280
02:22:37,647 --> 02:22:39,994
That day in the concert, my
father met his old friend.

1281
02:22:40,410 --> 02:22:42,844
You are always my boss.
Come Sir.

1282
02:22:49,208 --> 02:22:51,374
He too was in the car when
you followed my father.

1283
02:22:51,723 --> 02:22:53,613
I started a new bussiness.

1284
02:22:53,613 --> 02:22:55,566
He saw you creating
trouble with my father.

1285
02:22:55,566 --> 02:22:58,790
20 years back. In Goa.
You were with other two.

1286
02:22:58,790 --> 02:23:01,234
He said that you killed my father.

1287
02:23:03,062 --> 02:23:03,911
Why you killed them?

1288
02:23:06,063 --> 02:23:09,536
I'm not the one who killed your father.
your father's old friend.

1289
02:23:24,603 --> 02:23:28,459
Due to the SINTO-1 company,
sides effects are seen

1290
02:23:28,459 --> 02:23:31,146
Land is polluting and many are dying.

1291
02:23:31,146 --> 02:23:32,506
This is not the problem.

1292
02:23:33,516 --> 02:23:36,158
Climate temperature
is increasing.

1293
02:23:36,158 --> 02:23:38,214
Fertile lands are
turning to infertile.

1294
02:23:38,214 --> 02:23:41,402
In many countries there
is the scarcity of foods.

1295
02:23:42,271 --> 02:23:45,563
World is going to face a
big food crisis problems.

1296
02:24:05,832 --> 02:24:07,693
Golden rice with C4 mechanism.

1297
02:24:10,914 --> 02:24:14,248
whatever the climate,
it can grow massively.

1298
02:24:14,714 --> 02:24:16,974
The property that can
fullfill the world's need.

1299
02:24:21,902 --> 02:24:26,370
That property is
invented by SINTO-1.

1300
02:24:34,867 --> 02:24:38,037
From now onwards, every types of
countries(rich or poor,having food crisis)

1301
02:24:38,037 --> 02:24:41,018
 have to beg before
SINTO-1 for the food.

1302
02:25:03,285 --> 02:25:04,874
Sir, Gautam knew the truth.

1303
02:25:11,370 --> 02:25:45,169
<i><b>RAM</b></i>

1304
02:25:48,482 --> 02:25:51,884
He can't kill me nither do I.

1305
02:25:56,093 --> 02:25:59,941
My Golden rice is with him
and I've his past with me.

1306
02:26:02,454 --> 02:26:04,095
We need eachother.

1307
02:26:10,192 --> 02:26:12,533
Your father and I was
Co-Scientists in same company.

1308
02:26:12,533 --> 02:26:14,548
Not only that but
a good friends.

1309
02:26:14,548 --> 02:26:19,380
Your father always used to think about
the welfare of peoples and farmers

1310
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:21,702
He wanted to do
something for them.

1311
02:26:21,991 --> 02:26:26,658
After that we started this
SINTO-1 seeds hybrid company.

1312
02:26:26,658 --> 02:26:32,774
But your father involved in preparing
golden seed in a traditional way.

1313
02:26:32,774 --> 02:26:34,370
which I said impossible.

1314
02:26:34,370 --> 02:26:37,873
Suddenly he came to the
lab to test the seeds.

1315
02:26:37,873 --> 02:26:40,122
I got surprised
seeing the results.

1316
02:26:40,122 --> 02:26:41,725
That was Golden Rice.

1317
02:26:41,725 --> 02:26:48,200
Cores and cores of money was invested in the project
whose result was in you father's hand.

1318
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:50,720
I said him to give
it for the company.

1319
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:52,968
He said no and wanted
to give people freely.

1320
02:26:53,696 --> 02:26:56,741
For that he went to the Goa
International Rice Convention.

1321
02:26:57,570 --> 02:27:00,746
I thought of getting seeds
killing your father.

1322
02:27:01,709 --> 02:27:03,914
Joining Antonio there,
I killed your parents.

1323
02:27:04,999 --> 02:27:09,247
After that I found, the seeds your
father gave me was of no use.

1324
02:27:11,586 --> 02:27:14,789
There he put the
terminator gene.

1325
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:17,622
We got the information that
he hided seeds somewhere

1326
02:27:17,622 --> 02:27:21,514
and put its locations secretly in the Rubik's cube from the cab driver.

1327
02:27:21,779 --> 02:27:23,829
your father wants you to
have that Rubik's means

1328
02:27:23,829 --> 02:27:25,970
you know about finding the clue.

1329
02:27:25,970 --> 02:27:27,790
I sent my people behind you.

1330
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:29,790
But you were too clever.
You ran from there.

1331
02:27:34,213 --> 02:27:38,728
The magic that father hided 20
years back, now son has got that.

1332
02:27:38,913 --> 02:27:42,146
I got doubt when the bullet that killed
Michael didn't wanted to kill me

1333
02:27:42,146 --> 02:27:45,313
the one whom I'm searching is
expecting something from me.

1334
02:27:45,338 --> 02:27:47,572
At that time I got the
clue and went to bank.

1335
02:27:48,023 --> 02:27:50,242
In bank, I found the box
that my father hided.

1336
02:27:51,328 --> 02:27:52,872
But there was no
seed in the box.

1337
02:27:53,871 --> 02:27:55,792
Whats that there is
no seed in the box?

1338
02:27:55,792 --> 02:27:56,732
There must be seed.

1339
02:27:56,775 --> 02:27:59,848
There should also be the
details of my father in your story.

1340
02:28:04,660 --> 02:28:08,013
I know that you are eagarly waiting
to know about your parents.

1341
02:28:11,629 --> 02:28:13,091
Your father's name is Raghu Ram.

1342
02:28:36,324 --> 02:28:38,423
This is not original
golden rice.

1343
02:28:38,423 --> 02:28:40,298
My father name is
also not Raghu Ram.

1344
02:28:40,298 --> 02:28:41,456
How can you say that?

1345
02:28:54,667 --> 02:28:59,848
You won't kill me untill and unless I
say the truths about your parents.

1346
02:29:02,279 --> 02:29:03,763
That means that
file is not real.

1347
02:29:12,797 --> 02:29:14,186
Tell me where is seed?

1348
02:29:14,186 --> 02:29:16,460
I'll tell truths
about your parents.

1349
02:29:21,991 --> 02:29:23,454
Finally what I understood is

1350
02:29:24,833 --> 02:29:26,820
you won't tell me until
I give you the seed.

1351
02:29:27,906 --> 02:29:30,276
I won't give you seed until
you tell me about my parents.

1352
02:29:31,529 --> 02:29:33,805
The other truth that
you and I know is

1353
02:29:33,805 --> 02:29:36,490
As soon as I give you
seed, you'll kill me.

1354
02:29:37,436 --> 02:29:40,036
I too will kill you as soon
as you tell me the truths.

1355
02:29:41,187 --> 02:29:42,375
Never Ending Process.

1356
02:29:43,556 --> 02:29:45,452
There is only one
solution for this

1357
02:29:45,477 --> 02:29:47,525
one of us has to compromise.

1358
02:29:48,438 --> 02:29:49,887
I'll compromise.

1359
02:29:50,714 --> 02:29:52,035
I don't need my past.

1360
02:29:54,016 --> 02:29:55,769
Means?
-I'll kill you.

1361
02:30:29,721 --> 02:30:32,177
Gautam

1362
02:30:32,177 --> 02:30:35,137
I'm the only one to know
about your parents.

1363
02:30:35,137 --> 02:30:38,604
If you kill me then there
won't be your any past.

1364
02:30:38,604 --> 02:30:41,828
If I don't kill you then my
fathers wish will not come true.

1365
02:30:41,828 --> 02:30:45,211
Till now I thought knowing
my parents was my life

1366
02:30:45,211 --> 02:30:48,357
Now I decided to fulfill my
fathers wish is correct for me.

1367
02:30:53,543 --> 02:30:55,086
Your father's name
is Krishna Murthy.

1368
02:30:55,086 --> 02:30:56,478
He is a Scientist
from Philipines.

1369
02:30:56,743 --> 02:31:01,169
Ravindra.
Your father's name is Ravindra.

1370
02:31:01,194 --> 02:31:02,938
He used to work in Texas.

1371
02:31:09,277 --> 02:31:10,289
not Krishna Murthy.

1372
02:31:12,805 --> 02:31:15,132
I'l listen whatever
the stories you tell.

1373
02:31:16,006 --> 02:31:18,453
Coz in there is my parents
in every stories.

1374
02:31:19,791 --> 02:31:21,476
You'd killed him in every story.

1375
02:31:22,959 --> 02:31:24,733
The end of story is always same

1376
02:31:25,230 --> 02:31:26,303
that I'll kill you.

1377
02:31:32,393 --> 02:31:33,751
You won't kill me.

1378
02:31:33,751 --> 02:31:38,727
If you wanted then you'll
shot here and not in other places.

1379
02:31:40,096 --> 02:31:41,347
You won't me.

1380
02:31:41,347 --> 02:31:44,990
you want your past about your parents.
You won't kill me.

1381
02:31:45,753 --> 02:31:47,863
Its not new for me to kill you.

1382
02:31:47,863 --> 02:31:49,552
I have killed you many times.

1383
02:31:50,378 --> 02:31:52,391
I know what happens
when you die.

1384
02:31:53,220 --> 02:31:55,451
But you don't know what
happens when I kill you.

1385
02:32:04,728 --> 02:32:05,452
That's true.

1386
02:32:06,807 --> 02:32:08,085
What you said is correct.

1387
02:32:09,212 --> 02:32:10,293
I can't kill you.

1388
02:32:13,421 --> 02:32:14,981
I want my parents.

1389
02:32:16,734 --> 02:32:18,103
I want to know who they are.

1390
02:32:19,443 --> 02:32:21,556
I just remember my
mother feeding me.

1391
02:32:25,229 --> 02:32:27,229
I remember sitting
in my fathers lap.

1392
02:32:30,154 --> 02:32:31,983
Suddenly they said
I had no parents.

1393
02:32:32,956 --> 02:32:33,835
All was fictitious.

1394
02:32:34,945 --> 02:32:35,604
I cried.

1395
02:32:37,034 --> 02:32:38,366
Till now I kept on crying.

1396
02:32:45,612 --> 02:32:47,654
Tell me who were my parents.

1397
02:32:48,062 --> 02:32:49,705
At least tell me how they look?

1398
02:32:51,021 --> 02:32:52,279
How does my mother looked like?

1399
02:32:53,748 --> 02:32:55,219
How does my father looked like?

1400
02:32:55,319 --> 02:32:56,468
Do he looked like me?

1401
02:32:56,794 --> 02:32:57,813
You had seen them, right?

1402
02:32:58,419 --> 02:32:59,369
Tell me please.

1403
02:32:59,995 --> 02:33:01,277
Tell me something please.

1404
02:33:02,798 --> 02:33:03,991
Ok.
I'll tell.

1405
02:33:05,203 --> 02:33:07,188
First lets go to hospital, ok?

1406
02:33:09,841 --> 02:33:11,630
I'm dying.

1407
02:33:11,630 --> 02:33:14,684
You'll always be keep
on crying if I die.

1408
02:33:15,468 --> 02:33:19,230
I'll tell every damn thing.

1409
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:20,366
Every damn thing.

1410
02:33:20,943 --> 02:33:23,827
Where is... Golden Rice?

1411
02:33:24,343 --> 02:33:25,127
Where is it?

1412
02:33:45,843 --> 02:33:47,235
I'm sorry for everything Boss.

1413
02:33:48,731 --> 02:33:49,874
You are the ONE.

1414
02:33:51,555 --> 02:33:53,148
You'll always be ONE for me.

1415
02:34:21,735 --> 02:34:24,074
Sorry Dudu.
I've only one pain.

1416
02:34:24,714 --> 02:34:27,578
You are returning without
knowing your parents.

1417
02:34:28,377 --> 02:34:30,717
It would be good if
you'd known them.

1418
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:02,706
Stop the car.

1419
02:36:13,944 --> 02:36:16,312
What dear?
Do you forgot the way to your house?

1420
02:36:16,312 --> 02:36:18,543
I'll sing you a song for you.

1421
02:36:18,543 --> 02:36:20,291
Then you won't forget your way.

1422
02:36:20,291 --> 02:36:20,851
Ok?

1423
02:37:16,076 --> 02:37:22,847
Bye bye bye to the
Peter's statue.

1424
02:37:28,213 --> 02:37:34,850
Hi to the white
swan in the river.

1425
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:44,106
There's the road in
between the trees.

1426
02:37:44,106 --> 02:37:48,106
Run Run Run

1427
02:37:57,014 --> 02:38:00,167
In the field, there's tower.

1428
02:38:00,167 --> 02:38:02,587
Its so high.

1429
02:38:05,566 --> 02:38:08,328
There's a bridge in the way.

1430
02:38:08,328 --> 02:38:11,618
Fly Fly Fly

1431
02:38:12,672 --> 02:38:16,674
Then comes beautiful fields.

1432
02:38:16,674 --> 02:38:20,790

1433
02:38:21,951 --> 02:38:45,684
<i><b>Ram</b></i>

1434
02:39:21,184 --> 02:39:22,397

-I'm coming father

1436
02:40:14,751 --> 02:40:16,483
Gautam?
-Coming.

1437
02:42:34,909 --> 02:42:35,734
We are civilized.

1438
02:42:36,334 --> 02:42:37,634
We are mordernized.

1439
02:42:37,634 --> 02:42:38,710
We are globalized.

1440
02:42:39,754 --> 02:42:41,149
Civilization is a great failure.

1441
02:42:41,989 --> 02:42:43,339
People dying of hunger.

1442
02:42:43,339 --> 02:42:46,039
Every 3 of seconds, human
being is dying of hunger.

1443
02:42:47,124 --> 02:42:49,304
A man thought no one
should die of hunger.

1444
02:42:50,939 --> 02:42:54,839
He was not a farmer, not a
biologist and not a scientist.

1445
02:42:55,784 --> 02:42:58,144
In the desire to fulfilling
the hunger of every people

1446
02:42:58,144 --> 02:43:01,469
It made him a biologist, a
farmer and a scientist.

1447
02:43:02,339 --> 02:43:04,664
At every cost of
fullfilling his wish

1448
02:43:04,664 --> 02:43:06,574
He kept on trying continuously.

1449
02:43:06,574 --> 02:43:09,274
On the verge of trying,
he lost his life.

1450
02:43:10,394 --> 02:43:12,199
But he achieved what
he has dreamed for.

1451
02:43:14,614 --> 02:43:15,724
The Golden Rice.

1452
02:43:16,804 --> 02:43:18,354
A Second Green Revolution.

1453
02:43:19,184 --> 02:43:21,189
From now onwards, no people
will die of hunger.

02:43:22,279 --> 02:43:23,839
Today his dream is fulfilled.
