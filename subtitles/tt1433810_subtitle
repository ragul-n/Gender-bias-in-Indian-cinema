1
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:41,424
New to Mumbai?

2
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:45,702
Been here five months,
but it still feels strange

3
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,700
- Where are you from?
- Malihabad, Uttar Pradesh

4
00:01:56,146 --> 00:02:00,242
Malihabad is famous for mangoes.
l'm from U.P. too

5
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,377
- Jaunpur. Do you know it?
- Yes, l've been there

6
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:13,753
Come home soon

7
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:27,336
Look lmran, the famous Marine Drive
and up ahead is Chowpatty

8
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:33,440
People throng this place every day
to eat bhel puri, pav bhaji. . .

9
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,542
l think people come here
more for fresh air

10
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,851
which is in short supply

11
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,027
The sea air is so different

12
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:51,264
it smells of people's desires

13
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:56,597
Give me two rupees, l'm hungry,
please. . .

14
00:02:57,774 --> 00:03:01,175
Are you shooting?

15
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:04,179
Take my picture! Please!

16
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:08,509
lt's exactly your kind of flat...

17
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:13,441
Yes, a gas connection,
24-hour security

18
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:18,519
Yes, there's water...
most of the time

19
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,717
Just take a look

20
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,227
Okay, 6 o'clock

21
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:42,776
Do you like it, Mr Arun?
lt'll be perfect after a coat of paint

22
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:47,174
You 're a painter,
you 'll know what l mean

23
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:52,283
Think about it.
The lease is unlimited

24
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,350
There's the view you wanted of
the old city. That's the Aga Khan Tower

25
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,589
The station is nearby...

26
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:05,498
and you get a private toilet,
rare for these buildings

27
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:10,271
Yes, the kitchen is small,
but you 're not exactly a chef

28
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:36,592
What an actor!

29
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:39,532
l want to meet him

30
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:43,235
Johny Lever? l'll introduce you

31
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,307
Shut up!

32
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:48,939
Ma, if l fail this time, it'll be their fault

33
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:54,449
He's right, Salim.
You illiterate!

34
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:58,753
Just you wait. . .

35
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:02,916
Karim will study and become
a top class gentleman

36
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:04,186
Right, Karim?

37
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:09,031
Off to work again?

38
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:11,225
Damn filthy job, that

39
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:15,366
Why do you do it?

40
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:17,770
At least l'm not a crook like you

41
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,372
My job is better... right, Aunt?

42
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,740
Don't... stop it!

43
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:24,844
ldiot

44
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:42,587
- Shit!
- Damn... missed!

45
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,360
What did he think he was doing?

46
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:47,665
Shai, don't be such the NRl.
You know what traffic here is like

47
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,399
l'm so late, man, Pes...

48
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:52,668
My mum left for the show an hour ago

49
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:55,438
Nothing important starts in Bombay
before 1 0, love

50
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:29,337
There's Arun... delightful that he could
make it to his own opening

51
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,714
l like the new work.
What do you think, Jatin?

52
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:36,547
l think it's hard to be apolitical when
you are referencing the working classes

53
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:41,253
Ladies and gentlemen...friends. . .

54
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:43,986
The artist has decided
to make an appearance...

55
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:45,686
Finally. . .

56
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,789
Thank you all so much for coming...

57
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,563
and l take great pleasure
in presenting 'Building', Arun's new work

58
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,002
And now the part
that Arun hates the most...

59
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:57,596
Arun, please say a few words. . .

60
00:07:57,707 --> 00:08:00,972
Everybody, T. Arun. . .
Arun, be nice

61
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:07,483
Well, there's not much to say. . .

62
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:11,814
This is a tribute to the people of...

63
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:14,482
Rajasthan... U. P. . . .

64
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,754
Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh
and elsewhere

65
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:21,024
who built this city
in the hope that someday

66
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:22,598
they will find a rightful place in it

67
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,800
So, to Bombay. . .

68
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:27,927
my muse, my whore, my beloved

69
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:34,843
- To Bombay
- To Bombay

70
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:37,777
- Fantastic
- Thanks, thank you

71
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:39,075
- We really love your work
- Thank you

72
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,644
We'll have a huge painting of yours...

73
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,745
- You know the old style you used to. . .
- Sorry to intrude...

74
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,791
This is going to be
a really important show

75
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:50,985
and l am told your solos are much later

76
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:55,796
Arun, you have really
outdone yourself this time

77
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:58,424
Miraj Hussain, l need to talk to you

78
00:08:58,535 --> 00:08:59,968
How long does it take
to return a phone call?

79
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:05,506
That bad?

80
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:07,201
Don't ask...

81
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,471
Thank God for Pesi

82
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:11,570
- Hi, l'm Arun
- Hi... Shai

83
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:15,648
Guess l thought you looked
a bit stricken there

84
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:16,980
Yeah

85
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:31,227
So are you an artist too?

86
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:33,928
No, l am an investment
banking consultant

87
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:36,872
What... something to do with money?

88
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:39,237
Yes, broadly speaking

89
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:42,209
Essentially, l study investment trends
in South Asian economies

90
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:45,108
What... here in Bombay?

91
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,479
No, in New York, but...

92
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:49,211
l've moved here for a bit

93
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:51,583
Why?

94
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:56,151
l guess l needed a break
from things, you know

95
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:02,255
... a new perspective,
some fresh air in my head

96
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:05,232
- You plan to get that here in Bombay?
- Yes. . .

97
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:09,228
Well, maybe just a change of scene then

98
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,600
Cool, l could do with a holiday too

99
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:18,905
Actually, l'm not on holiday.
l'm on a sabbatical

100
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,643
Really? What's that supposed to mean?

101
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:25,651
lt means l've received a research grant

102
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:29,589
to submit a project about small
and marginal businesses

103
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:32,992
and shifts in traditional occupations

104
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:36,554
Basically, l have to write a few papers

105
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,601
and spend time doing
what l love doing most...

106
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:41,398
taking photographs

107
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,600
Rat... rat... !

108
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:47,803
Oh... l'm so sorry

109
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:51,176
l just saw a rat...

110
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:52,213
l am serious

111
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,940
l'm so sorry

112
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,678
Well, now my show is truly open

113
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:58,685
Cheers!

114
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:00,719
Cheers!

115
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:53,500
Early morning, and everyone's
racing against the clock

116
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:02,110
Look how quickly she cooks her curry

117
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,947
Like she's in a race

118
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,916
Who knows what it'll taste like!

119
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:18,292
We have a maid.
Out here they are called 'bai'

120
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:23,058
How quickly she does the dishes,
cleaning and laundry!

121
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,963
Won't stay an extra minute!

122
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,898
So unlike our Zubeida back home. . .

123
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:34,272
who'd insist on staying back,
to oil my hair, or a massage

124
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,377
Poor dear... how is she?

125
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:55,887
You 've been up long?

126
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,595
A couple of hours...

127
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:02,434
- Tea?
- l'd love some

128
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:11,373
Listen, l just helped myself to a shirt
that was lying on your chair

129
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,915
because mine was trashed
with that wine stain

130
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:14,881
Yeah, that's fine

131
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,387
Milk and sugar?

132
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:19,284
Yes, please

133
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,229
l had a lovely time last night

134
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,144
So tell me... do you always live like this. . .
out of boxes?

135
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:51,951
Moving house. . .

136
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,455
Really? Why?

137
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,222
Lease has run out. . .

138
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,857
So you found a new place then,
have you ?

139
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,194
Yeah

140
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:07,830
You know, l found your opening last night

141
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,962
to be quite an experience

142
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:10,903
Are they all like that?

143
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:17,643
My mom loves these arty do's...
she's quite a collector

144
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:19,647
We have a lot of art at home

145
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:21,614
ln fact, we are running short of walls

146
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,358
Are you hung over?

147
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:40,933
No

148
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:54,506
Hey, is something wrong?

149
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:58,676
No, actually Shai, l'm really. . .

150
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:01,381
l'm really sorry about last night. . .

151
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,789
l mean, l was so drunk
and l had no idea. . .

152
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,691
Hey, what are you sorry about?
Don't be sorry

153
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:08,991
l had a really great time

154
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,763
No, l'm quite a loner and. . .

155
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:16,964
l keep to myself and. . .

156
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:19,234
and l don't usually do this you know

157
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:20,604
Hey, it's cool. . .

158
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,200
l'm glad you don't usually do this

159
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,109
l mean, hey, l don't either. . .

160
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,311
No, actually what l'm
trying to say, Shai is that. . .

161
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,444
l'm not the relationship kind at all

162
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:33,215
you know...

163
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,917
and l'm really sorry
if l led you into believing...

164
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,856
that this was something more...

165
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,892
something more...

166
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:40,519
more than just a shag

167
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:48,964
l'm sorry, Shai, l don't mean to. . .

168
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,038
Look Shai, what l'm trying to say is that. . .

169
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,735
Look, l have no idea what's going on
in your head right now. . .

170
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,334
and l'm not sure l want to know

171
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,561
Arun, you know what...

172
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:26,731
lt's cool. . .

173
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:28,606
Take care, l'll see you around

174
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:56,203
Yes, Munna... come in

175
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:11,784
Any clothes for washing?

176
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,111
Sir...?

177
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,390
No, there's no laundry.
l'm moving house

178
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,391
- Can you come there?
- Sure, give me the address, l'll find it

179
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:30,028
Wait

180
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:38,805
This is the Gateway of lndia,
Bombay's most famous landmark

181
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:49,722
- Can we go?
- Let's take a picture together for lmran

182
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:51,623
Who will take it?

183
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:54,161
- Could you take our picture?
- Sure

184
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:57,029
How does this work?

185
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,829
- Point it towards us... can you see us?
- Yes, l can

186
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,762
- Done?
- Yes

187
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:04,066
Go, take the camera

188
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:05,566
Thanks

189
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:12,373
l guess you are right

190
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:14,575
l don't know, Pes...

191
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,117
l really thought he was special

192
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:18,417
You know... l mean...

193
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,921
we got along so well the night before

194
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,486
Well, it wasn't just the sex, Pes

195
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:30,392
Yeah. . .

196
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,834
Like he was really into me

197
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:35,597
and he was so intense. . .

198
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:38,696
and then, suddenly in the morning. . .

199
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,673
he was like a completely
different person...

200
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:42,368
hold on a sec...

201
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:43,502
Yeah...?

202
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,506
l'm the dhobi

203
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:49,175
Come in

204
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:50,809
Pes, l'll have to call you back

205
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,151
This dhobi guy just walked in
and l don't know where Agnes is

206
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:56,615
Okay, bye

207
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:01,088
There were 1 2 clothes,
please count them

208
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,738
This has turned blue!

209
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:15,504
lt had a big stain, so l tried to whiten it

210
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,704
l should've told Agnes
to put this is in the laundry

211
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,212
lt's completely ruined now

212
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:26,245
Give it to me, l'll correct it

213
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,186
No. . . who knows
what colour it'll become next. . .

214
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:31,517
Damn. . .

215
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:36,560
Madam, my mistake. l'll fix it

216
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,508
What's your name?

217
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:54,480

218
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:57,815
Zohaib, l'm Shai

219
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:38,914
First Letter, Second Letter,
Third Letter

220
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:20,259
Rakesh, the people who lived here
have left some stuff behind

221
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:23,527
Some tapes, a ring...

222
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:25,463
...no, a silver ring

223
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:29,361
Can't you return it to the landlord?

224
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,674
What if they ever ask for it?

225
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:38,043
Cool, l'll throw it away,
but don't ask for it later

226
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:39,444
Okay, bye

227
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,031
First Letter

228
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:05,999
- Which college do you go to?
- l don't go to college

229
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:10,010
Who has time for college?
He works in the movies

230
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,049
Really? Which films were you in?

231
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:18,113
Hey...

232
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:21,850
Zohaib, right?

233
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:28,226
- Which film are you here to watch?
- Yuvraaj

234
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,888
So are we!

235
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:33,629
This will be my first-ever Bollywood film

236
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:38,466
See you ...

237
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:44,877
Zohaib... huh?

238
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:50,316
- She's a friend of mine... Shai
- Do l look like a fool?

239
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,819
Come on, let's get to the bottom of this

240
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,690
ls it switched on?

241
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,924
Bring it here

242
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:08,769
Look, when this red light flashes
it's recording

243
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:11,867
lt's recording now

244
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:18,146
This is great! So cool!

245
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:23,380
Say something,
l'm shooting your picture

246
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:26,545
- What should l say?
- Just smile

247
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:42,799
This is wonderful!

248
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,207
But tell me, how will lmran see this?

249
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:56,914
l wanted to send him photos of us.
Can he watch this on his TV?

250
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,570
Salaam Aleikum, lmran... all well?

251
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:23,835
l had promised l'd send you our photos.
But l didn't have a camera

252
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:27,973
So he got me this video one instead

253
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:32,579
l thought l'd send you this,
to watch on your TV

254
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:36,615
Show it to Mum and Dad as well

255
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:42,857
How am l looking?
Just the same, right?

256
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:45,900
Bombay hasn't changed me yet

257
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:48,993
l'm still the same Yasmin

258
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:55,768
Your exams are round the corner now

259
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:59,041
Study hard, do well,
and come here soon

260
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:04,114
You 've always wanted to visit Bombay

261
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:06,983
l'm here now, we'll have lots of fun

262
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,653
We'll go to Juhu beach. . .
eat bhel puri !

263
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:19,765
Maybe l could give you a tour
of Bombay with this camera

264
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:21,631
Good idea, isn't it?

265
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:25,469
Goodbye for now

266
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,699
She stole my heart. . .

267
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:37,408
and slipped away. . .

268
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:58,056
The full-grown male
weighs about 3 tonnes

269
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:00,968
l'm into fashion designing...

270
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:05,263
What a rotten breakfast!
Have you lost your mind?

271
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:11,071
Don't you remember,
l like omelettes for breakfast?

272
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:56,247
Would you like some tea?

273
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:02,123
- Agnes, 2 cups of tea, please
- Yes

274
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:03,623
Come in

275
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,765
Have a seat

276
00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:18,629
So you like The Doors?

277
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:27,079
Are you a photographer?

278
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:31,648
No, this is just a hobby

279
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:35,850
l work in a bank, in America

280
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:40,386
Why did you leave America?
lsn't life more advanced there?

281
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,830
Who told you that?

282
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:47,095
Yes, some ways it's more advanced
but. . .

283
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:55,134
- Are you from Mumbai?
- No from Bihar

284
00:31:55,244 --> 00:31:57,235
Darbhanga district

285
00:31:57,346 --> 00:32:01,510
- So why did you move here?
- To fill my belly, why else?

286
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:04,719
ls your family here?

287
00:32:05,654 --> 00:32:09,954
No, l came alone, when l was eight.
l stayed with my uncle

288
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:14,325
- Ever go back home, to visit?
- No, never

289
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:15,259
Why?

290
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,064
Don't you miss family?

291
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,029
Were you unhappy at home?

292
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:27,899
lt was okay. . .

293
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,074
less to eat, that's all

294
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:33,647
We were always hungry

295
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:40,047
When l first came here,
l worked at a hotel

296
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:43,181
There l had my fill,
of food and thrashings!

297
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:00,773
Can you take a picture of me?

298
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:05,005
Yeah... sure

299
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:09,607
Not like this. . .
Can you take pictures for a portfolio?

300
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:13,511
Why? Want to be a model?

301
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,324
No... actor

302
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,888
Well, l can try... l mean. . .

303
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:25,858
never really done that
sort of thing before

304
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,832
What was that?

305
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:29,426
l mean, yes. . .

306
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:33,533
But you have to return the favour

307
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:36,941
You have to allow me
to take pictures of you at work

308
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:40,505
What work?

309
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:42,845
Your washerman's work, what else?

310
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:54,325
Munna, whose shirt is this?
Sir said it's not his

311
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:58,060
- lt's Mr. Arun's. . .
- lt's mine. . .

312
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,259
You know Arun, the painter?

313
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:02,434
Yes

314
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:06,063
Do you know where his new house is?

315
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:08,331
Yes

316
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:10,468
Could you show it to me?

317
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:13,241
l want to return this shirt

318
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:14,906
l can do that

319
00:34:15,016 --> 00:34:16,813
No, l want to surprise him

320
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:22,322
So, is Munna your nickname?

321
00:34:22,424 --> 00:34:24,756
Yes... you can call me that

322
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,937
The rain here is so different

323
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:37,902
unrelenting...

324
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:41,307
falls incessantly. . .

325
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:49,148
Like a lullaby at night. . .

326
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:51,719
its sound engulfs you . . .

327
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:55,890
drowning out the neighbours' TVs

328
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,556
But l feel sorry for my maid, bai
whose house gets flooded

329
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:08,096
She says, she has to bail out
the water by hand

330
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,469
l must go, l think he's back

331
00:35:13,575 --> 00:35:16,066
Need to heat the food

332
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:21,944
l've made lamb with beetroot today,
the way Mum taught me

333
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,041
l hope he likes it. . .

334
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:30,184
Then l'll watch some TV,
because he doesn't talk much

335
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:34,225
l hope there's a good film on

336
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:41,769
And anyway, why are we even here?

337
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,531
l thought you claimed
you are not into this guy

338
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:46,599
l don't know

339
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,438
There's something
we left unfinished, l think

340
00:35:50,846 --> 00:35:52,711
Couple of positions
you haven't tried yet?

341
00:35:56,818 --> 00:35:59,150
So go, ring his doorbell

342
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:02,053
l can't

343
00:36:02,157 --> 00:36:03,749
l don't really know him and...

344
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:07,751
who knows, he might have somebody
up there with him right now

345
00:36:07,863 --> 00:36:09,728
That's possible

346
00:36:09,831 --> 00:36:12,766
These artist types,
they get a lot of action

347
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:16,166
Such a crummy neighbourhood

348
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:23,067
Hey, this is one of our buildings

349
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:25,112
This neighbourhood is getting posh then

350
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:33,187
Oh, wait. That's him, isn't it?

351
00:36:33,288 --> 00:36:35,518
- What? What happened?
- Get down, he'll see us

352
00:36:36,725 --> 00:36:39,125
He's not that cute, really

353
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:53,207
Pes, come let's go there

354
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:54,775
- To that South lndian joint?
- Yeah

355
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:57,208
Pure Veg? No, thanks

356
00:36:57,312 --> 00:37:00,372
- Who is going for the food?
- l am

357
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:03,508
l can't spy on an empty stomach

358
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:06,712
- Come, l'll find you a nice Parsi boy
- Yeah, right

359
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:49,457
ls there a problem, Munna?

360
00:37:49,564 --> 00:37:54,160
Actually, l was hoping
we'd shoot in a studio

361
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,338
No, studios are so artificial

362
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,731
l thought we'd get some natural shots

363
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:05,704
So you want to shoot on the streets?

364
00:38:05,814 --> 00:38:07,611
Yes, natural, you know...

365
00:38:08,984 --> 00:38:12,044
like you 're standing
or sitting somewhere

366
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:17,248
No, no, please shoot in a studio.
l'll pay for it!

367
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:20,787
lt isn't about the expense

368
00:38:22,697 --> 00:38:26,497
lt'll be very different
from other portfolios. . .

369
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:28,694
totally fresh

370
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:31,601
l don't want anything ''fresh''!

371
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:34,106
Are you sure you know how to do this?

372
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:55,026
Smile

373
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:01,926
Nice

374
00:39:02,037 --> 00:39:03,004
Something else?

375
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:10,077
Can you lose these glasses?

376
00:39:12,414 --> 00:39:13,346
Hands down

377
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:17,444
Okay, Munna, don't smile

378
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:20,949
Hold it

379
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,120
Better

380
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:27,285
Do you have another T-shirt?
This one's too bright

381
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,657
No. . .

382
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:32,494
Shall l take it off?

383
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:36,964
... let's try

384
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:45,911
Really nice

385
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:48,982
Hold it

386
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:05,999
lmran, this lady is our neighbour

387
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,496
For some reason she never says a word

388
00:40:11,506 --> 00:40:13,736
Nor does her expression ever change

389
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,474
Something must have happened with her

390
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,740
Poor thing

391
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:32,691
Hello... how are you ?

392
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:54,379
Yes, Vatsala

393
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:58,312
What do you mean... fourth floor, why?

394
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,614
Yes, why?

395
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:10,596
No, l was meant to but. . .

396
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:12,757
One second. . .

397
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:17,127
Yes, l meant to call him, but. . .

398
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:18,967
l was really busy, so. . .

399
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:21,268
l couldn't find the time and...

400
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:23,344
l'll probably call him some time today

401
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,773
So what have you been up to?

402
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:34,078
Should have known. . .
holed up at home, watching porn

403
00:41:34,189 --> 00:41:36,157
- Mad or what?
- Really?

404
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:37,155
Then what's that?

405
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:39,492
Some stuff...

406
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:42,028
Stuff? What stuff?
Why are you so cagey?

407
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:45,923
First... letter...

408
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:47,331
Give that to me...

409
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:50,766
Yasmin Noor? Who is Yasmin Noor?

410
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:53,238
V, give it back. Stop it

411
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:54,672
Who is Yasmin Noor?

412
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:55,640
Come on, give it back

413
00:41:57,045 --> 00:41:58,979
What? Not in the mood?

414
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:05,848
We didn't sell much...

415
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:09,557
l mean, the market's a bit slow,
but l was hoping we'd do better

416
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:13,149
You didn't really talk
to anyone at the show

417
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:15,320
Except for that girl with Pesi

418
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,330
Who was she?

419
00:42:17,432 --> 00:42:18,922
Shai?

420
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:21,126
She's a banker or something

421
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:24,865
Shai... she's Perwin Edulji's daughter

422
00:42:24,973 --> 00:42:27,373
Perwin bought more art last year
than anyone l know

423
00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:29,174
l hope you charmed her

424
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:31,805
This is so much easier with paper

425
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,047
You haven't asked me why l came

426
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:39,216
Why did you come?

427
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,722
l've wangled a show for you

428
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:44,416
Ask me where

429
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:45,787
Where?

430
00:42:45,894 --> 00:42:47,987
Sydney

431
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,727
l wanted to surprise you

432
00:42:50,832 --> 00:42:53,096
You know, there's this gallery
l've been in touch with

433
00:42:53,201 --> 00:42:55,101
about Medha's work and Gagan's work

434
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:57,569
l slipped in a catalogue
of your work

435
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,139
They seemed to really like it

436
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,300
ln fact, they want to
open their lndia section with you

437
00:43:04,312 --> 00:43:07,543
This will launch you internationally,
l'm so excited

438
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:12,051
And of course, you 'll get to see Shiv

439
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:15,851
How old must he be by now?

440
00:43:16,925 --> 00:43:18,358
Almost six

441
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,138
So, did you like my work?

442
00:43:37,245 --> 00:43:38,507
What do l say...

443
00:43:39,514 --> 00:43:41,345
l think it's great

444
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:44,384
Great, thank heavens

445
00:43:44,485 --> 00:43:45,975
Tea?

446
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:50,052
You 're my first ''client'',
so l was nervous

447
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:53,483
No, your work is superb

448
00:43:56,464 --> 00:43:57,897
But...

449
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:00,497
tell me...

450
00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:02,733
What?

451
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:07,070
How do you like me?

452
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,073
ln the pictures...

453
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:17,609
l think you look great

454
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:23,785
Now you have to take me to Dhobi Ghat

455
00:45:01,362 --> 00:45:03,796
- Show me the pink ones
- Here, madam

456
00:45:08,736 --> 00:45:11,500
- How much?
- Rs 75 for a set

457
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:13,904
Did you hear that, lmran?

458
00:45:14,008 --> 00:45:15,873
No, that's too much

459
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:18,275
Don't worry, l'll knock down the price

460
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:00,083
Hey, dad

461
00:46:02,256 --> 00:46:03,621
Yeah, l am here

462
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:06,821
Yeah, it's great

463
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:08,589
Yeah...

464
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:11,221
What's his name...
your site manager... ?

465
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,392
l think it was Harish or something...
he set it up for me

466
00:46:17,872 --> 00:46:20,272
Yeah, it's great...
thanks, dad

467
00:46:22,543 --> 00:46:24,340
l'm getting some great shots

468
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,339
Okay, bye

469
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:17,329
- What are you shooting?
- l'm new to the city so...

470
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:22,135
So what? Don't you know
all this isn't allowed?

471
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:29,003
New to Mumbai?

472
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,738
See all you want, surely that's free!

473
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:27,691
What are you looking at?

474
00:48:28,736 --> 00:48:30,533
What are you staring at?

475
00:48:30,638 --> 00:48:31,900
At the camera

476
00:48:32,006 --> 00:48:34,941
Look straight ahead!
Never seen a camera before?

477
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:39,008
lt's none of your business where l look

478
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:41,206
lt is! Look ahead!

479
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:54,551
Tell madam she wants to shoot me
returning the clothes

480
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:01,061
She wants to take pictures
of me working

481
00:49:02,303 --> 00:49:04,498
Why? You come inside

482
00:49:04,605 --> 00:49:08,439
Ma'am, actually l'm shooting him
at work from washing to delivering

483
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:11,375
So if you don't mind, can l shoot him
handing over the clothes?

484
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,772
Take the clothes

485
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:25,391
One salwar ...

486
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:28,760
One kurta...

487
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:34,692
Madam wants you inside

488
00:49:35,836 --> 00:49:38,896
Tell her l'm in a hurry.
l'll come by another day

489
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:46,238
Did you see how she glared at me?

490
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:50,017
Forget about her

491
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:52,449
But she won't forget about you !

492
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:01,588
Second Letter

493
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:05,254
Smile for me, bai

494
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:07,765
Oh dear...

495
00:50:07,868 --> 00:50:09,199
Just a little

496
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:12,839
Where's your daughter?

497
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,272
- Over there
- Vanita, come here

498
00:50:15,376 --> 00:50:17,344
Vanita, come here...

499
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:18,139
Come on...

500
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:21,776
Come, don't be shy

501
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:28,510
lmran, meet Lata bai
and her daughter Vanita

502
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:30,351
Say hello to my brother

503
00:50:31,258 --> 00:50:33,726
But where is he?

504
00:50:33,761 --> 00:50:36,161
Ma, she's recording our pictures
to send to her brother

505
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:39,225
She's a smart girl

506
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,732
Which class are you in?

507
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:42,302
Class 9, English Medium

508
00:50:43,738 --> 00:50:45,569
Then say something in English for us

509
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:49,341
Go on, recite that poem

510
00:50:52,313 --> 00:50:55,248
''The Brook'', by Alfred Lord Tennyson

511
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:58,978
l come from haunts of coot and hern,
l make a sudden sally

512
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,946
And sparkle out among the fern,
And bicker down the valley

513
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,988
By thirty hills l hurry down,
Or slip between the ridges

514
00:51:10,164 --> 00:51:13,327
By twenty thorpes a little town,
And half a hundred bridges

515
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:17,762
... l've forgotten the rest

516
00:51:17,872 --> 00:51:19,066
Wow!

517
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:21,437
Bai, she's very smart

518
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:23,373
A bit too smart

519
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:27,311
Watches TV all day.
Dancing and singing with songs...

520
00:51:27,415 --> 00:51:29,383
so her grades have dropped

521
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:31,474
Wow, then dance for us...

522
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:33,280
Go on

523
00:51:33,387 --> 00:51:35,685
Some other time then...

524
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,553
- Should l get back to work?
- Yes

525
00:51:48,302 --> 00:51:51,396
Can't say, sir,
my shifts keep changing

526
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:55,001
l don't know when
this lady lived in your flat

527
00:51:57,011 --> 00:52:00,003
There was a maid called Lata bai
who worked here

528
00:52:00,114 --> 00:52:01,547
Do you know her?

529
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:06,919
l've heard the name.
But l can't say for sure

530
00:52:09,924 --> 00:52:11,448
Please ask around

531
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,824
She might still be working in this area

532
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,023
- Please find out
- Okay, sir

533
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,560
How long have you known Arun?

534
00:52:50,064 --> 00:52:51,554
Why?

535
00:52:51,665 --> 00:52:53,792
Just... curious

536
00:52:55,402 --> 00:52:56,960
Around four years

537
00:52:58,072 --> 00:53:00,165
Has he always lived alone?

538
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:04,667
No, earlier he lived
with his wife and son

539
00:53:04,778 --> 00:53:06,803
What? No way

540
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:08,245
Yes, why?

541
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:11,944
They split two years ago

542
00:53:12,052 --> 00:53:13,314
Divorced

543
00:53:16,657 --> 00:53:18,284
He was in a bad way then

544
00:53:19,226 --> 00:53:20,659
Just wouldn't open the door

545
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:24,687
One day l shouted,
''Open the door, or l'll call the police!''

546
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,024
Then?

547
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:29,034
Finally, he opened the door

548
00:53:30,004 --> 00:53:32,336
Thank God he was alive

549
00:53:32,439 --> 00:53:36,398
l made some tea, we drank it,
and then l left

550
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:39,209
Then?

551
00:53:40,314 --> 00:53:42,248
Then he got okay

552
00:53:45,252 --> 00:53:47,447
What was his wife like?

553
00:53:47,555 --> 00:53:48,954
Nice

554
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,222
Fair... tall...

555
00:53:52,326 --> 00:53:54,351
Taller than Arun

556
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:08,036
Aren't you married?

557
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:14,847
Boyfriend?

558
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:18,043
ln the past

559
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:20,486
Not anymore

560
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:22,287
And you ?

561
00:54:23,691 --> 00:54:26,057
Why not? You 're so handsome

562
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:31,062
What can l say?

563
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,497
l... haven't really liked anyone...

564
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:38,894
as yet

565
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,676
You 'll find someone

566
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,922
- Hello
- Hello, Shai Edulji

567
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:11,122
- When did you arrive?
- This evening, darling

568
00:56:11,231 --> 00:56:13,529
- Where's mum?
- She's already gone off to bed

569
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:17,228
- So, having fun?
- Yes, it's been great

570
00:56:17,337 --> 00:56:19,328
Like today,
l shot in the Dhobi Ghat

571
00:56:20,407 --> 00:56:22,671
You know what your mum would
have to say about that, right?

572
00:56:22,776 --> 00:56:26,735
She'd probably say l needed
a vaccination shot or something

573
00:57:34,214 --> 00:57:36,910
That Raju is a real bastard!

574
00:57:37,017 --> 00:57:39,247
He did me out of 50 grand

575
00:57:39,353 --> 00:57:41,378
And here l was trying to help him

576
00:57:42,055 --> 00:57:44,023
l gave him a good thrashing

577
00:57:46,193 --> 00:57:50,789
And warned him
l'd complain to Kale Bhai

578
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:53,395
That's when he got scared

579
00:57:54,902 --> 00:57:58,269
Just because he's Lambu 's brother
he throws his weight around

580
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,438
Munna, l need some cash

581
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:12,177
l've got to put down 1 0,000...

582
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:14,811
for that apartment in Jogeshwari

583
00:58:14,922 --> 00:58:15,980
Look...

584
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:20,282
l've got 7,000. Give me three

585
00:58:20,394 --> 00:58:21,918
l'll return it next month

586
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,424
You still owe me 4,000

587
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:27,022
l can't loan you any more

588
00:58:27,668 --> 00:58:32,230
l swear l'll pay you back. Don't worry

589
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:35,797
Kale Bhai is giving me
a big job next month

590
00:58:36,743 --> 00:58:39,109
And l'll get my share out of Raju

591
00:58:39,213 --> 00:58:41,613
For sure. l promise

592
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:48,615
But Salim, don't mess with Lambu

593
00:58:48,722 --> 00:58:50,246
Yes, mom!

594
00:58:55,062 --> 00:58:56,086
What?

595
00:58:58,031 --> 00:58:59,521
Why are you laughing?

596
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:01,760
Did your Ma'am take these?

597
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:03,234
Just look at you !

598
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:08,841
l mean, you look great

599
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:12,036
But l don't know why l found it funny

600
00:59:12,145 --> 00:59:14,545
You look handsome, buddy

601
00:59:14,648 --> 00:59:16,878
What a body!

602
00:59:25,259 --> 00:59:27,693
When will you introduce me
to that producer?

603
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:30,228
Do something for me, fatso!

604
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,026
You think l won't?

605
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:35,601
l'll take you tomorrow. For sure

606
00:59:39,606 --> 00:59:41,631
l have to say...

607
00:59:41,742 --> 00:59:44,643
this Ma'am of yours seems really nice

608
00:59:44,745 --> 00:59:46,406
Why don't you tell her?

609
00:59:47,347 --> 00:59:49,247
What are you scared of now?

610
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:52,614
- She's already seen you half-naked!
- Shut up!

611
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:16,937
YASMlN NOOR

612
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:28,578
Nothing lasts here...

613
01:00:30,023 --> 01:00:33,049
The sea claims everything

614
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:39,857
l can share everything with it,

615
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:42,333
tell it all my secrets,

616
01:00:43,437 --> 01:00:47,134
and they'll sink softly
to its depths

617
01:00:49,142 --> 01:00:51,406
The sea will keep them safe

618
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:12,196
Nice to see you again,
how are you doing?

619
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:14,529
l'm good, how are you ?

620
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:16,693
Good, very good

621
01:01:16,803 --> 01:01:19,738
Moved house, working on a new project

622
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,138
l live right here, in fact.
On the fourth floor

623
01:01:22,242 --> 01:01:23,573
- Really?
- Yeah

624
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:27,336
l was just going in here,
this building

625
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,874
Are you going to shoot something?

626
01:01:31,985 --> 01:01:35,113
Yeah, just shooting
the construction work and all that...

627
01:01:35,222 --> 01:01:36,450
it's one of my dad's sites

628
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:42,489
- So, you are...
- Well, l should...

629
01:01:44,398 --> 01:01:46,457
- Sorry
- No, it's okay...

630
01:01:46,566 --> 01:01:47,863
No, do you want to have
a coffee or something?

631
01:01:47,968 --> 01:01:49,265
l mean... do you have the time?

632
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:52,770
Yes... l have time for a coffee

633
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:55,103
So, do you want to come to my house?

634
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,642
- Okay, yes
- Come

635
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:04,507
So how's the sabbatical been going?

636
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:07,487
lt's been pretty good, so far

637
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:11,483
Been seeing a lot of the city?

638
01:02:11,591 --> 01:02:13,218
Yeah... kind of...

639
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:16,386
Have you been spending a lot of time
in this area? Mohammad Ali Road?

640
01:02:16,496 --> 01:02:18,589
Well, not really

641
01:02:21,802 --> 01:02:25,033
l guess one needs a guide
to see all the really local stuff

642
01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:28,535
Yeah...one needs a guide...

643
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:33,101
And you ?
You 've been working?

644
01:02:34,314 --> 01:02:36,339
Yeah, kind of...

645
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:38,916
There is this...

646
01:02:41,254 --> 01:02:43,381
something that l am quite
excited about...

647
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,720
That's great...

648
01:02:45,826 --> 01:02:48,420
You look a lot happier, l have to say

649
01:02:57,037 --> 01:02:58,527
You know, Shai,
l really want to apologise

650
01:02:58,638 --> 01:03:00,071
for being such an ass
the last time

651
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:02,198
Oh, no...not more apologies...

652
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:04,937
Just forget about it, okay, please

653
01:03:05,045 --> 01:03:08,378
lt's really not a big deal. Really

654
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:11,508
Although l was really pissed off
with you , for a while

655
01:03:12,452 --> 01:03:15,046
That's me at my best....
pissing people off

656
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,724
And when l get drunk,
l do these random things

657
01:03:20,894 --> 01:03:22,521
lt gets so embarrassing

658
01:03:23,997 --> 01:03:26,261
l know what you mean,
l'm hoping you don't remember

659
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:28,061
half of the things l did that night

660
01:03:28,168 --> 01:03:30,159
Apart from the headstand, you mean...

661
01:03:32,472 --> 01:03:33,996
Hey Munna, what's up?

662
01:03:35,075 --> 01:03:36,770
Nothing today, come tomorrow

663
01:03:50,323 --> 01:03:51,688
Hey, have you been
to the Elephanta caves?

664
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:52,883
That's another great place

665
01:03:54,394 --> 01:03:55,326
No...

666
01:03:56,296 --> 01:03:58,594
Listen, l have to go...

667
01:03:58,698 --> 01:04:00,529
Oh, okay...

668
01:04:03,236 --> 01:04:05,636
l just remembered
l have to meet someone

669
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:07,938
Thanks for the coffee...

670
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,702
Sure...

671
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,974
- Show me your photos sometime
- Definitely

672
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,150
- Where are you going?
- l have work

673
01:04:23,256 --> 01:04:24,245
What work?

674
01:04:25,325 --> 01:04:27,725
You said you 'd take me
to Nagpada today

675
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:31,155
And we'd see a film

676
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:35,030
That ''Hello'' or whatever

677
01:04:35,135 --> 01:04:37,228
Come on, Munna, you promised

678
01:04:40,273 --> 01:04:41,968
l've even bought tickets

679
01:04:42,976 --> 01:04:44,238
Please

680
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,988
My ancestors came to Bombay
and set up shop in 1 905

681
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:04,758
We are the 5th generation,
and we're still here

682
01:05:08,468 --> 01:05:10,561
But now it's the machine age

683
01:05:11,571 --> 01:05:14,039
Young people prefer bottled perfumes

684
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:58,941
Why are you doing all this?

685
01:05:59,052 --> 01:06:01,612
l want to understand...

686
01:06:03,857 --> 01:06:05,620
to see...

687
01:06:05,725 --> 01:06:07,886
See what? These filthy places?

688
01:06:09,129 --> 01:06:11,723
American streets too clean for you ?

689
01:06:41,728 --> 01:06:44,128
Look... there... the King of Lalbaug

690
01:06:45,165 --> 01:06:46,757
Where? Which one, Vanita?

691
01:09:28,795 --> 01:09:30,888
- How much was that?
- 40 Rupees

692
01:09:31,998 --> 01:09:33,659
No, please let me get this

693
01:09:35,702 --> 01:09:38,262
You 're my guest, it's on me

694
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:41,632
Hello, Salim...

695
01:09:43,443 --> 01:09:45,707
Not today, l'm a little busy

696
01:12:59,605 --> 01:13:00,833
Hi, mom

697
01:13:01,808 --> 01:13:03,867
Good, good, and you ?

698
01:13:06,879 --> 01:13:09,939
Yeah, still doing my mad shooting

699
01:13:12,685 --> 01:13:14,550
Well, l am done

700
01:13:14,654 --> 01:13:19,091
l'm done with dhobis,
and ear cleaners, and the circus

701
01:13:22,128 --> 01:13:25,564
and l'm soon going to be
doing the night rat-killers

702
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:29,296
No, no kidding

703
01:13:30,737 --> 01:13:33,672
Of course, l'll be fine mom

704
01:13:35,441 --> 01:13:36,874
And when do you come next?

705
01:13:38,778 --> 01:13:40,302
Good, so l'll see you soon then?

706
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:45,317
Okay, bye

707
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:52,422
Shai baby, you stay away
from this dhobi guy

708
01:13:52,525 --> 01:13:54,493
- Why?
- He's not a good boy

709
01:13:55,595 --> 01:14:00,589
He's just extra smart,
got no education, totally worthless

710
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:06,366
Third Letter

711
01:14:22,722 --> 01:14:25,782
Bakri Eid is ten days away

712
01:14:25,892 --> 01:14:28,690
You know how much it frightens me

713
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:34,427
l always feel terrible, that we sacrifice...

714
01:14:34,534 --> 01:14:37,867
those who we raise with so much love

715
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:43,339
Remember, how l used to hide at home?

716
01:14:47,747 --> 01:14:50,181
He's out of town,

717
01:14:50,283 --> 01:14:53,775
but his aunt has invited me for the ritual

718
01:14:53,886 --> 01:14:56,286
l've already thought up an excuse...

719
01:14:58,291 --> 01:14:59,690
Diarrhoea!

720
01:15:02,195 --> 01:15:05,187
Remember when we were kids...

721
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:08,165
how we'd find excuses
to skip Koran class?

722
01:15:09,202 --> 01:15:11,796
lt's the same thing with this aunt

723
01:15:15,842 --> 01:15:18,208
That's it for now

724
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:20,939
lt's taking me ages to finish these tapes

725
01:15:21,914 --> 01:15:24,644
All the news will be stale

726
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,949
Anyway, better late than never, right?

727
01:15:36,262 --> 01:15:39,629
She was like, ''Mrs. Fonseca,
l want to be a nun.''

728
01:15:40,566 --> 01:15:42,124
We were like, ''What?!''

729
01:15:43,035 --> 01:15:45,026
Listen, l know,
let's go to my place in Khandala

730
01:15:45,137 --> 01:15:48,129
- Now?
- Yes, totally, it's gorgeous in the rain

731
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:50,072
Actually, it's not a bad idea

732
01:15:50,176 --> 01:15:52,644
Anyway, l can't. l promised
Munna l'd go with him

733
01:15:52,745 --> 01:15:53,677
to that Dongri place tomorrow

734
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:56,043
- lt's Munna time
- What is with this Munna fixation?

735
01:15:56,148 --> 01:15:58,673
l mean, how much can you
hang out with your Dhobi?

736
01:15:58,784 --> 01:16:00,649
Yes. So?

737
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:02,721
So, it's just slightly weird... slightly?

738
01:16:02,822 --> 01:16:04,722
l know you guys have things
in common and all but

739
01:16:04,824 --> 01:16:06,553
after a point, it's like

740
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:08,957
''How many clothes did you wash today?''

741
01:16:09,061 --> 01:16:11,154
Stop it

742
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:13,255
- Just kidding
- Sorry, sorry...

743
01:16:13,366 --> 01:16:15,459
Listen, listen.
Forget all this nonsense

744
01:16:15,568 --> 01:16:17,661
- Let's have some real fun now
- Okay

745
01:16:21,574 --> 01:16:23,269
You 've changed, you know

746
01:16:25,044 --> 01:16:26,875
You 're in love

747
01:16:26,979 --> 01:16:28,412
Lay off

748
01:16:29,282 --> 01:16:30,374
Have you told her?

749
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,851
But her parents will never agree

750
01:16:37,089 --> 01:16:38,784
You 'll have to elope

751
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:41,625
Are you nuts?

752
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:43,456
Sorry, first you have to propose

753
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:48,427
Hello, sir!
lt's been ages...

754
01:16:50,403 --> 01:16:51,870
Sure l have some

755
01:16:52,805 --> 01:16:54,238
'A' grade stuff

756
01:16:55,474 --> 01:16:57,374
Where should l come?

757
01:16:57,476 --> 01:16:59,103
Now make a right

758
01:17:00,246 --> 01:17:01,736
l'm over here

759
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,420
Forgotten me, sir?

760
01:17:09,522 --> 01:17:11,285
- How much?
- Seven

761
01:17:12,425 --> 01:17:15,053
When l bought from that Raju ...

762
01:17:15,161 --> 01:17:18,562
- Come on, sir...
- l got better stuff at five

763
01:17:18,664 --> 01:17:20,029
Raju 's a cheat!

764
01:17:25,504 --> 01:17:27,972
Six is what l buy it for.
Nothing less than six

765
01:17:28,074 --> 01:17:29,564
Nothing less, my ass

766
01:17:29,675 --> 01:17:31,267
Here's two more

767
01:17:31,377 --> 01:17:32,844
Special rate just for you , sir

768
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,112
And please don't go to Raju again

769
01:18:12,018 --> 01:18:13,508
Look at me

770
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:28,129
Don't come if you don't want to.
l've never forced you

771
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:32,298
l don't know
what's come over you suddenly

772
01:18:32,405 --> 01:18:34,737
Something's up
between you and that girl

773
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,932
That's not true

774
01:18:37,143 --> 01:18:39,202
You 're in love with her, that's what

775
01:18:40,746 --> 01:18:41,610
ldiot!

776
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:46,610
The truth is never pleasant, is it?

777
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,779
That American girl plays you ,
and you go crazy

778
01:18:51,557 --> 01:18:54,025
Munna, don't forget your status!

779
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,224
Now get out of here

780
01:18:57,329 --> 01:19:00,389
And don't come back
when she dumps you

781
01:19:07,006 --> 01:19:08,871
Get me a Coke with ice

782
01:19:10,342 --> 01:19:12,606
And Munna won't be coming anymore

783
01:19:13,612 --> 01:19:16,080
Tell the watchman and find a new dhobi

784
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:32,553
Why do people make
so much of marriage?

785
01:19:34,467 --> 01:19:37,163
l should never have got married

786
01:19:38,604 --> 01:19:40,902
But no one listened to me

787
01:19:43,209 --> 01:19:45,507
l used to be so happy

788
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:55,679
Shall l tell you something?

789
01:19:55,788 --> 01:19:57,915
He has another woman

790
01:20:04,296 --> 01:20:07,788
l wanted to ask him something
so l called his mobile phone

791
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:11,526
A woman answers and asks,
''Who's this?''

792
01:20:12,638 --> 01:20:14,333
l said, ''His wife.''

793
01:20:15,608 --> 01:20:17,542
She started laughing

794
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:23,275
She gave him the phone saying,
''She's so naïve...''

795
01:20:24,316 --> 01:20:25,806
Where did you find her?

796
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,851
Well... forget all that

797
01:20:38,097 --> 01:20:42,158
That day when you called,
l was so excited l forgot to ask...

798
01:20:43,235 --> 01:20:45,328
How did you do in the exams?

799
01:20:46,272 --> 01:20:48,035
And how's our kid sister?

800
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:54,079
Back home, it must be
mango season now

801
01:20:56,182 --> 01:20:58,844
l really miss that taste

802
01:21:11,163 --> 01:21:12,596
Yes, V. Tell me

803
01:21:15,534 --> 01:21:16,831
Yes, it's going well

804
01:21:18,537 --> 01:21:19,367
l'm not sure

805
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:23,634
l'm not sure means
l'm not sure, l don't know

806
01:21:25,377 --> 01:21:27,402
Look V, l can't work
with deadlines anymore

807
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:29,572
When l'm done, l'll tell you .
Until then, quit hassling me

808
01:21:36,889 --> 01:21:39,255
- Please take off your T-shirt!
- Cut it out

809
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:42,660
Yes?

810
01:21:42,761 --> 01:21:45,025
Lambu is sitting with Kale Bhai

811
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:48,588
- Kale Bhai has sent for you
- l'm busy

812
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:52,637
- What does he want?
- Maybe he wants to have dinner with you

813
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:55,434
Now? lt's almost midnight

814
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:57,771
So shall l tell him you 're busy?

815
01:21:59,211 --> 01:22:02,271
- Where...?
- ln the shed behind the station

816
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:03,871
Go ahead, l'm coming

817
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:08,717
- Shall l come along?
- No, l'll be back soon

818
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:14,589
You finish your filthy job,
then we'll have breakfast together

819
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:26,302
Madam, this is a large area

820
01:22:26,405 --> 01:22:27,895
Two men cover it

821
01:22:36,615 --> 01:22:38,776
There's one of the workers

822
01:23:25,798 --> 01:23:28,062
This is my last letter

823
01:23:29,401 --> 01:23:32,234
l don't know whether it will reach you

824
01:23:36,408 --> 01:23:39,400
May Allah keep you
in health and happiness

825
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:54,489
This is my last letter

826
01:23:56,328 --> 01:23:58,922
l don't know whether
it will reach you

827
01:24:03,068 --> 01:24:05,468
May Allah keep you
in health and happiness

828
01:24:12,945 --> 01:24:14,879
Don't be angry with me

829
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:17,645
l've tried my best

830
01:24:23,288 --> 01:24:25,756
Explain to Mum and Dad as well

831
01:25:07,866 --> 01:25:09,697
Brother

832
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:14,065
Move...

833
01:25:25,818 --> 01:25:28,013
You have to be strong for your mother

834
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:34,583
Don't worry son, we are here for you

835
01:29:13,945 --> 01:29:16,106
We are here to see the apartment

836
01:29:16,214 --> 01:29:18,512
- May we look around?
- Yes

837
01:29:42,407 --> 01:29:45,433
Hello Aunty, l was wondering
if l could leave this packet

838
01:29:45,544 --> 01:29:47,637
for your neighbour, Mr. Arun

839
01:29:55,721 --> 01:29:57,382
How did it happen?

840
01:29:58,757 --> 01:30:01,157
A fight between the two gangs

841
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,051
Salim became the scapegoat

842
01:30:04,162 --> 01:30:06,289
- Did you go to the cops?
- You kidding?

843
01:30:06,398 --> 01:30:08,628
They buried Salim within hours,

844
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:12,135
and moved us to
this apartment in Jogeshwari

845
01:30:12,237 --> 01:30:14,364
What would the cops do anyway?

846
01:30:14,473 --> 01:30:16,634
They'd harass us, not them

847
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:21,240
Brother, help me out

848
01:30:22,247 --> 01:30:24,181
Any bit role

849
01:30:26,418 --> 01:30:28,477
The family is my responsibility now

850
01:32:26,738 --> 01:32:28,399
Can't you see!

851
01:32:43,688 --> 01:32:45,747
Are you angry with me?

852
01:32:46,691 --> 01:32:50,684
You 've been avoiding my calls.
Have you changed your number?

853
01:32:53,598 --> 01:32:55,293
Salim is dead

854
01:33:04,509 --> 01:33:07,205
They say he was
knocked down by a train

855
01:33:09,714 --> 01:33:12,308
Bastards. Killed the brother l had

856
01:33:29,734 --> 01:33:33,170
All this happened and you didn't tell me?

857
01:33:35,607 --> 01:33:37,973
Aren't we friends?

858
01:33:40,245 --> 01:33:42,839
Of course! We are friends!

859
01:33:52,757 --> 01:33:55,624
And now l can't find Arun either

860
01:33:57,429 --> 01:33:59,420
Bloody painter

861
01:34:01,232 --> 01:34:03,962
You fancy him, don't you ?

862
01:34:06,871 --> 01:34:09,431
He must have gone to Australia
to his ex-wife

863
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:16,178
Who knows?
They might get back together.

864
01:34:16,281 --> 01:34:18,408
They have a son too

865
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,545
So. . .

866
01:34:24,656 --> 01:34:26,317
Call me sometime

867
01:34:27,659 --> 01:34:29,251
Keep in touch...
