1
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:49,019
Tehran, Iran

2
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,819
Bobby, where have you been?

3
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:20,615
Whiskey, whiskey.

4
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,983
-You want some whiskey?
-No, champagne.

5
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,424
-Champagne? Yeah.
-Bob.

6
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:28,257
My brother wants to know...

7
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:31,797
...have you ever tried liquid MDMA?

8
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:34,402
Liquid MDMA? No.

9
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,836
Tehran is the world capital.

10
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,237
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

11
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,743
You've got a...friend there.

12
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,719
How's the kid?

13
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,886
He's fine.

14
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:58,992
He's....

15
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:00,754
He's fine.

16
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,196
Arash, when you wanna do this?

17
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:11,535
After prayer.

18
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,335
Okay.

19
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,155
-You said they were both for you.
-What do you care?

20
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,725
Not a move!

21
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,588
Okay. Okay.

22
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,286
I was looking for the bathroom.

23
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:16,989
Not a word. Shut up!

24
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,996
Okay.

25
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:28,572
You don't speak Farsi, do you,
you son of a goat?

26
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:03,703
Georgetown
Washington, DC

27
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:16,424
Mr. Whiting, I'm Bennett Holiday.

28
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:21,428
A very big company, Connex, our client...

29
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:28,499
...Ioses a huge natural-gas contract
in the Persian Gulf...

30
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,139
...to the Chinese. At the same time...

31
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:36,074
...a smaller company, Killen,
somehow gets the rights to Kazakhstan...

32
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:39,339
...one of the largest
untapped oil fields in the world.

33
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:42,814
The big company, our client,
merges with Killen...

34
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,079
...Justice wants to know
how Killen got those rights.

35
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,883
You've been scrutinizing
exactly these types of deals...

36
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,152
...so if there's something to find...

37
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,058
...I expect you to get it before they do.

38
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,358
And come straight to me.

39
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,861
Bennett.

40
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,530
Sir?

41
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:11,244
At my firm, I have a flock of sheep...

42
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:14,042
...who think they're lions.

43
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,518
Maybe you're a lion
everyone thinks is a sheep.

44
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,518
No, I wanna talk about the Gulf,
and how a goddamn emir--

45
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,993
Connex Oil
Houston, Texas

46
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:30,997
-What is an emir anyway?
-King, it's a king.

47
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:35,968
A king. Well, how some Podunk king
tossed you out on your ass.

48
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,438
Every company in the world
wanted into Kazakhstan...

49
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,705
...into the Tengiz, but Killen got it.

50
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,347
And then Connex wanted Killen,
and here we are.

51
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,057
I made investments.

52
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,187
Investments that'll bear fruit
for this company.

53
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,097
Hell, Tommy, we've all got
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act...

54
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,497
...committed to memory.

55
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,730
I got a little copy of it taped
to the wall of my head. Right here.

56
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
Thanks, Jimmy.
We appreciate hearing your point of view.

57
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:17,071
However, a U.S. Attorney...

58
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,181
...is looking into your relationships
in Kazakhstan...

59
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:23,716
...and the U.S. government is holding off
on approval of our merger.

60
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:25,547
So Mr. Janus and I have brought...

61
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,882
...Connex's Washington counsel,
Sydney Hewitt...

62
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:31,390
...down here to talk about
our strategy for the next 30 days.

63
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,290
Sydney?

64
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,071
In a way, I feel like Switzerland.

65
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:49,070
I'd like to remind everybody in this room
they've signed confidentiality agreements.

66
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,148
Allow me to introduce my associate,
Bennett Holiday...

67
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,878
...who will be-- How shall I put it?

68
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:01,251
--building consensus day-to-day.

69
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:02,686
Good morning.

70
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,242
You've just visited what
someday soon...

71
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,935
...could be the most profitable
corporation in America.

72
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,876
Provided the government
approves the merger.

73
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:28,573
Provided we don't start
running automobiles on water.

74
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,618
And provided there's still chaos
in the Middle East.

75
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:35,188
Now the job is, find the problem,
fix the problem.

76
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:38,987
And if you do not find a problem,
then there is no problem.

77
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,891
And when the government
approves this merger...

78
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:44,430
...it's gonna buy a lot of houses
in the Vineyard.

79
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,363
Maybe even yours.

80
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:50,868
Geneva, Switzerland

81
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:04,483
Cheerios again?

82
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,781
-Max!
-Max!

83
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:16,726
-Hey, man.
-Let's not read at the table, okay?

84
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,129
-Put this hand here. Block me.
-Sweetie, sweetie.

85
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,532
-Mommy? I want bacon.
-Yeah?

86
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:24,505
-You have bacon.
-I want real bacon.

87
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:28,303
You have real bacon,
only it's made from soy beans.

88
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:31,946
I want pig bacon.

89
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,981
I want pig bacon too.

90
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:39,077
-Don't say it.
-I'll try it if you try it.

91
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:41,416
-I don't know if I can bite this.
-It's crunchy.

92
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,896
-How'd you do that?
-It's kind of hard to cut.

93
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,157
-It's pretty bad.
-You be quiet.

94
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:55,661
<i>A merger between two U.S. oil companies
is taking place in Houston.</i>

95
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:58,671
<i>The new company,
Connex-Killen Corporation...</i>

96
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:02,504
<i>...will become the fifth largest
oil and gas company in the world.</i>

97
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:07,377
<i>The move affects 37,000 workers
in 160 countries...</i>

98
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,010
<i>...and, with revenues larger than the gross
domestic product of Pakistan or Denmark...</i>

99
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:15,919
<i>...will create the world's
23rd largest economy.</i>

100
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,160
<i>Mr. Leland Janus, chairman of Connex,
spoke today of synergy...</i>

101
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,423
<i>...and a desire to pass on savings
to the consumer.</i>

102
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,227
The merged operations
will create economies of scale...

103
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:30,031
...to deliver the best products to
the consumer at the lowest possible prices.

104
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,696
LELAND JANUS
CEO, CONNEX OIL

105
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,805
<i>It's a merger of necessity
for Connex, Rebecca...</i>

106
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:39,209
<i>...who wants Killen's fields in Kazakhstan,
after gas blocks they pursued in the Gulf...</i>

107
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:41,441
<i>...were awarded
to a Chinese consortium.</i>

108
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,814
<i>Producer nations continue to look
toward developing markets in Asia...</i>

109
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:47,387
<i>...which is having a powerful effect
on crude prices.</i>

110
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,618
<i>There's at least 10 to 12 dollars
of instability premium.</i>

111
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,991
You have protests in Iran,
the threat of more strikes in Venezuela...

112
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:59,567
...and the Turks still making noise about
Russian crude through the Bosphorus.

113
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,465
All right, thanks for having me, Rebecca.

114
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:08,334
<i>I'm playing. That's my job, playing.</i>

115
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:12,413
Yeah, well, that's a very,
very good job for you to have.

116
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,641
<i>-Tell Daddy you love him.
-I love you, Daddy.</i>

117
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:18,109
Hey.

118
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:23,358
The emir's summer party,
Marbella, this weekend.

119
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,155
Any interest?

120
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,318
Well, I can't. I got, you know....

121
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,862
Guy could be huge
for the company, Bryan.

122
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:33,263
It's Maxie's birthday this weekend, so--
So we have Saturday--

123
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:37,532
Hey, Bryan, I just need your help on this--
The emir's party. I'll take that.

124
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,197
Through finagling,
we have an audience with the emir.

125
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:43,209
He wrote the strategy, and he's not slick.

126
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,878
I'll bet you a thousand he can't sell it.

127
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,207
I didn't say I could go.

128
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:47,610
Dollars or Swiss francs?

129
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,182
-Dollars.
-Fine.

130
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:54,014
Come on. Take the children with you.
The beach, summer, Marbella. Max'll love it.

131
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,488
-Can I do that?
-Sure you can.

132
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,718
Besides, they love children.

133
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:03,058
John D. Rockefeller.
Founded the University of Chicago.

134
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,460
Come on.

135
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,679
<i>That's fine. You're a good song leader,
Mr. Rockefeller.</i>

136
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:33,259
The Persian Gulf

137
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:11,462
The Connex/ Al-Salwa facility
is under new ownership...

138
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:15,331
...and your services are no longer needed.

139
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:23,273
What did he say? I can't hear.

140
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,844
He's telling us to scram.

141
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:26,208
"Scram"?

142
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,779
What do you mean, "scram"?

143
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:35,752
Your immigration permit through
this company is no longer valid.

144
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:41,659
You must report to the Department
of Immigration within two weeks...

145
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,789
...or you may be deported.

146
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:52,003
The Chinese are smart people,
but such bad drivers.

147
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:55,473
They should not be allowed
even to wash cars.

148
00:14:58,347 --> 00:15:02,977
When I was your age, in Pakistan,
there was always in the distance....

149
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,885
Snow-covered mountains.
Yes, I know, Papa.

150
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,455
That's right.

151
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:13,084
Three hours away, but right there...

152
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:16,193
...across the entire sky...

153
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:19,901
...like you could reach out
and touch them.

154
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,436
Snow-covered mountains.

155
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,477
As soon as we can...

156
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:33,206
...we'll get a house and bring
your mother here.

157
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,846
I promise.

158
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,700
<i>Bob's freaking out
about this other missile.</i>

159
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:05,512
"Where's the missile? Who has it?"
He wrote a memo.

160
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,706
Central Intelligence Agency
Langley, Virginia

161
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,317
I just finished convincing
Brit and French intel...

162
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,886
...we had nothing to do
with the Amiri job.

163
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,081
What do we say to them now?
"Well, something's missing."

164
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:19,716
<i>He's gotta stop this.
He's gotta stop with the memos.</i>

165
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:28,194
<i>Okay. Here's something.
You put him up for promotion.</i>

166
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:31,573
He's due. He's a good man.
He saved our ass in Beirut in '85.

167
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,766
That's great. Terry likes him.
We'll get him an audition downtown.

168
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,309
<i>You get him an audition downtown.</i>

169
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:40,039
<i>They're going crazy about Iran now.
Bob's an expert.</i>

170
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:41,682
<i>Speaks Farsi, for chrissake.</i>

171
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,552
<i>Bob has never had a desk job.</i>

172
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,086
<i>He's never done 9 to 5,
never been on committee.</i>

173
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:50,890
He's gotta show up to work every day.
He's gotta stay on message.

174
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,723
Absolutely.

175
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,523
<i>I'll prep him.</i>

176
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:01,159
In fact, we just pulled
one of our officers out.

177
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,861
I took the initiative to ask him
to come down here.

178
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:09,543
He infiltrated Hezbollah in Beirut
in the '80s, won himself some nice medals.

179
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,745
We're thinking about
giving him a station.

180
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:15,350
Beirut in the '80s,
is that a résumé-builder?

181
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:19,752
Don't chomp down on any bait.

182
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,184
We're fine.

183
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:23,221
Iran is fine.

184
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,949
Fine.

185
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,793
And our analysis seems to be on the mark.
We're getting good satellite coverage.

186
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,900
We're reprogramming resources
into Iran--

187
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:36,060
Thank you for coming.
Welcome back and forgive me if I wade in...

188
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,207
...but forgetting for a second
your bureaucratic checklist...

189
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:42,775
...I'm trying to get
undigested information.

190
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:48,179
-Well, to the best of our ability--
-India is now our ally. Russia is our ally.

191
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,874
Even China will be an ally.

192
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,351
Everybody between Morocco
and Pakistan is the problem.

193
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:59,017
Failed states and failed economies,
but Iran is a natural cultural ally of the U.S.

194
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:02,220
Persians do not want to roll back
the clock to the eighth century.

195
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:06,060
I see students marching in the streets.
I hear Khatami making the right sounds.

196
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:10,171
And what I'd like to know is,
if we keep embargoing them on energy...

197
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,172
...then someday soon,
are we gonna have a nice, secular...

198
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,368
...pro-Western, pro-business government?

199
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,144
It's possible. It's complicated.

200
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,286
Of course it is. Thank you for your time.

201
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,729
They let young people march in the street.
Next day, they shut down 50 newspapers.

202
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,061
<i>Put a few satellite dishes up on the roofs,
let them have My Two Dads.</i>

203
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:43,829
That doesn't mean the ayatollahs...

204
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:47,442
...are surrendering one iota of control
over that nation.

205
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,634
Mr. Barnes,
the reform movement in Iran...

206
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:52,838
...is one of the president's
great hopes for the region...

207
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:56,610
...and crucial to the petroleum security
of the United States.

208
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:00,020
These gentlemen are with the CLI.

209
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:07,524
The Committee for the Liberation of Iran,
Mr. Barnes.

210
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,661
Princeton, New Jersey

211
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:20,801
Maybe you'll get made ambassador
to somewhere cool.

212
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:24,742
Like France or Italy or Ghana.

213
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:29,143
It's not beyond the realm
of possibility, is it?

214
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,818
How's your mom?

215
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,956
Great. She's great.

216
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,826
So I know it's still a year away...

217
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,328
...but I'll have to have a car,
a decent car.

218
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:48,959
Nothing too fancy, but it has to run
so that I can get into Boston and New York.

219
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:52,105
They have a great crew.
That's what they told me.

220
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,765
I said, "Crew of what?"
And they said, "Rowing."

221
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,411
-So if I wanna row, it'd be kind of fun.
-Thank you.

222
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,376
Robby, listen.

223
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,280
I live in Maryland...

224
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:07,753
...which means that you have
residency in Maryland.

225
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:10,153
For the University of Maryland.

226
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:18,166
I'm sorry, can I steal this from you?
Thank you so much.

227
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:24,338
I just want a normal senior year, Dad.

228
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,867
I want a normal house.

229
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,943
I want Cinemax and prom.

230
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,113
You know what prom is like in Pakistan?
Prom sucks in Pakistan.

231
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,716
It's complicated, you know.

232
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:38,318
I may have really screwed up at work.

233
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:39,884
How?

234
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:42,523
I was supposed to keep
my mouth shut and I didn't.

235
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:51,966
What does Mom do, again,
that we have to live in Islamabad?

236
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:04,172
-She's a secretary.
-Secretary.

237
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:11,375
Robby.

238
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,680
Both of my parents are professional liars.

239
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,322
Hey.

240
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:25,226
Did you guys just get a party?

241
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,061
I do too.

242
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:31,136
This is a party not for you.

243
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:35,834
Marbella, Spain

244
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:41,382
<i>It is my pleasure to personally welcome
each of you...</i>

245
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,676
All right, guys.

246
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:44,478
<i>...to the Casa de las Palmas...</i>

247
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:46,981
<i>...our oasis of palms in the south of Spain.</i>

248
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:49,521
-Does somebody live here?
-Yeah, in the summertime.

249
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:55,323
<i>I hope everyone is having
a wonderful day...</i>

250
00:21:55,998 --> 00:22:01,698
<i>...and taking time from your hectic lives
to relax with friends and family...</i>

251
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:06,498
<i>...whether it is enjoying the flowers in our
bountiful gardens...</i>

252
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:11,508
<i>...or sampling the myriad delicacies...</i>

253
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:15,774
<i>...prepared by chefs from
our prosperous home.</i>

254
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:20,117
Please eat and socialize...

255
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:25,319
...and enjoy your time with us.

256
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:33,695
I am happy to welcome the Chinese
to my country.

257
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:38,263
My father welcomes the Chinese
to our country.

258
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,237
Of course.

259
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,204
Please.

260
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,606
Right there.

261
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,579
Thank you.

262
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,552
Arabs are very family-oriented,
as a people.

263
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:02,629
Is that racist?

264
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,356
Sure.

265
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,001
-It is?
-A little.

266
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,499
Well, no. I mean, I guess
if what you're saying is positive.

267
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,535
You have to go in.

268
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,804
Don't.

269
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:24,946
Let him work it out on his own.
It's important for his autonomy.

270
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:34,057
All right!

271
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:50,908
An announcement.

272
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,578
If man is made in God's image...

273
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:58,617
...then God is deeply messed up.

274
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:08,794
You afraid?

275
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,019
Afraid of the buzz?

276
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,665
I'm afraid of your breath.

277
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,802
Hakim hasn't had any.
And he wears jewelry.

278
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,930
He thinks that little bracelet's gonna
get him girls.

279
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:21,570
Hakim!

280
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:24,303
<i>Hakim! Hakim! Hakim!</i>

281
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:30,014
I want to talk to your uncle about work.

282
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,244
There isn't any work.

283
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,612
Farooq!

284
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:34,914
You said you'd introduce me.

285
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,418
Don't be such a pest.

286
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,920
Hakim! Hakim!

287
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:41,358
Are you here to see the emir?

288
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,054
Yeah.

289
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:45,559
Me too.

290
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,862
What do you do?

291
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:55,839
I'm a partner in
a derivatives-trading company in Geneva.

292
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:58,469
-Energy?
-Yeah.

293
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,046
Right.

294
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,648
-Bryan Woodman?
-Yes.

295
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:03,215
-Good evening.
-Hi.

296
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,449
Hi, Bryan Woodman.

297
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,521
We regret that His Highness
will be unable to see you.

298
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,558
However, we are authorized
to hear your proposition on his behalf.

299
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,793
Oh, okay.

300
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,993
What, here? Now?

301
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:26,232
Okay. Well....

302
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:31,376
Okay. Our position is that
the real worry for you guys...

303
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:34,014
...is another year of record pricing.

304
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:38,619
There are no more elephant fields,
not even in natural gas...

305
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,688
...and as structural alternatives
become more fully realized...

306
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:46,293
...you'll need new strategies to maximize
every penny of your existing resources...

307
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,453
...particularly in a climate
of falling prices.

308
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:54,330
And that's what, you know, our firm is
prepared to help problem-solve with you...

309
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:57,300
...the, you know, foreseeable...

310
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,408
...and unforeseeable problems
you encounter.

311
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:07,139
This house is a Genius-Home.

312
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:10,078
One of my sons had it wired by experts
from the United States.

313
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:11,341
Watch.

314
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,492
Your Highness, that is incredible.

315
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:27,399
Prince Nasir, isn't that amazing?

316
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,097
Fascinating.

317
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:33,867
The Chinese take the trouble
to learn Arabic.

318
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:35,769
Look, it's getting dark.

319
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,172
Better turn on the pool lights.

320
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:49,721
Send a fool on a fool's errand.

321
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:53,754
Moussa, come fix this remote control!

322
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,112
Are you not talking?

323
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:23,515
Come on, sweetheart.
Just a little bit, okay?

324
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,923
You're the shark, and you try
to tag us as we swim across.

325
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:29,359
All right? You jump in,
count "one, two, three" ...

326
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,396
...then we try to get to the other side.

327
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,057
-All right? Okay.
-Okay. Come on.

328
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:36,203
Come on, go. Go.

329
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:40,907
Yeah. Okay.

330
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,639
-Come on, jump in.
-Come on.

331
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,214
-Come on. Jump in!
-Sissy!

332
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,877
Just jump, come on!

333
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:03,320
Max?

334
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,329
-Max!
-Oh, my God!

335
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,704
Cut the power! Cut the power!

336
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,268
Max! Max!

337
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,374
-Let go!
-Somebody cut the power!

338
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,542
-Max!
-Come on. Come on.

339
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:23,809
-That's my son!
-Oh, my God.

340
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,350
-Get out of my way!
-Okay.

341
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,851
-Oh, my God!
-Take him!

342
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:30,923
Take him! Take him out.
Take him this way. Take him out.

343
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:33,054
Put him down. Down, down.

344
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:36,388
-Sweetie?
-Someone get a doctor, doctor, doctor!

345
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:38,429
He's not breathing. He's not breathing.

346
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,659
-Get a doctor!
-Is anybody a doctor?

347
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:43,536
Do something! Help us!

348
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,842
<i>I hear phrases thrown around like
"the corrupting influence of money"...</i>

349
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:55,243
Washington, DC

350
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:58,818
<i>...or "the evil influence
of dollars in politics "...</i>

351
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,820
<i>...when more money was spent
on the syndication rights...</i>

352
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,550
<i>...to the Seinfeld television program...</i>

353
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:08,719
<i>...than on the whole of
the last presidential election.</i>

354
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,127
<i>Last election cycle,
I spent $300,000.</i>

355
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,758
<i>I have pictures of myself with the president
that I use all over the world.</i>

356
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,529
I didn't make this coffee for you.

357
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:21,573
<i>People don't know Danny Dalton, but they
know the president of the United States...</i>

358
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:25,110
<i>...and they see that I know
the president of the United States.</i>

359
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,077
<i>-In a free society...
-Making it for me.</i>

360
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,909
<i>...the one written into law...</i>

361
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,710
You...

362
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:33,683
<i>-...it's the people, individually...
-...I'm making oatmeal.</i>

363
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,289
<i>-...and organized into committees...
-Then you sleep.</i>

364
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,858
<i>...not the U.S. government,
who decide the issues....</i>

365
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,392
You look like shit.

366
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:42,655
<i>...of a political campaign.</i>

367
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:45,163
<i>In our country, we don't...</i>

368
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:48,636
<i>...stuff dollars into ballot boxes.</i>

369
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:50,065
<i>-What we do...
-You working?</i>

370
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:52,798
<i>-...is turn money into votes.
-I had trouble at work.</i>

371
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:54,407
<i>The ability of a candidate....</i>

372
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:57,204
There's beer in my fridge,
so you don't die of the DTs.

373
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,811
Please don't smoke in my house.

374
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,112
<i>--meaning, not so loosely translated,
that money is speech.</i>

375
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:12,024
<i>And, last time I heard, speech in
the United States of America is protected.</i>

376
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:16,960
<i>You can't limit my advocacy
just because it works.</i>

377
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:24,630
<i>I have a sovereign, inalienable right
to petition my government.</i>

378
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,607
<i>And why is it some dirty little secret...</i>

379
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:34,578
...that it's in America's interest
to do business overseas?

380
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:04,467
Two of my wife's kids were deported
from this country.

381
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:06,705
You know why?
Because they didn't have work.

382
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:08,348
You don't have to pay me.

383
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:11,485
Give me something to do.

384
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:13,780
Then decide.

385
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:20,159
I'm sorry. I already have a
long list for that job too.

386
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:23,559
And if you want to work in this country...

387
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:25,096
...learn the language.

388
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,530
Learn Arabic!

389
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,006
Foreign workers' compound
The Persian Gulf

390
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,010
Why are they running?

391
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,211
Maybe the small one...

392
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:52,390
...committed a crime or something.

393
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,996
They gave us french fries
at the Islamic school.

394
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:07,003
Close the door, Papa.

395
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:10,836
His sister has a thing for you.

396
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:13,646
His sister has a big ass.

397
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:17,044
Of course, at the Islamic school you
don't have to worry about that.

398
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:20,187
And lamb. We got skewers of lamb.

399
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,619
I like lamb.

400
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:33,924
<i>Have your identification card ready.
No talking in line.</i>

401
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:41,372
<i>Have your identification card ready.
No talking in line.</i>

402
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:46,110
I can't remember it this hot.

403
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,840
Old man, you don't want to talk here.

404
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:50,006
Stop talking.

405
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:54,922
Tough guy.
What's your name?

406
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:56,412
What's your name?!

407
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:57,990
Johnny.

408
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:19,062
Mommy!

409
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,746
Mommy!

410
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,809
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Mommy.

411
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,918
Come here, bear. Come here.

412
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:35,385
You okay?

413
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,047
I wanna look out the window.

414
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:41,593
You wanna look out the window?
Come on.

415
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,931
I spy a bird.

416
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:03,843
<i>Well, if on Monday,
Iran refuses the IAEA inspectors...</i>

417
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,452
<i>...you can look to crude prices
to spike yet again.</i>

418
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:15,424
Right. Well, it's not exactly a secret
that Iran will refuse snap inspections.

419
00:35:17,498 --> 00:35:19,864
Okay, Rebecca. Thank you.

420
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,562
Go home.

421
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:28,803
It was a stupid fucking question, Henry.

422
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:33,073
The prince's man called again.

423
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,478
I'm just telling him.

424
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:48,493
U.S. Department of Justice
Washington, DC

425
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,032
Hey, how bad is it?

426
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,760
When a Volvo dealer says that....

427
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:58,872
Okay. You're honorable, decent guys.

428
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,405
Right.

429
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:03,569
My wife and our narrow driveway....

430
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,372
-How the hell are you?
-Well, you know, can't complain.

431
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:09,778
That's not good, kiddo.
That's suffering quietly.

432
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:11,976
Married? Kids?

433
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,856
There is no way a company like Killen...

434
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,754
...pulled off a deal like this
without paying somebody off.

435
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,721
Why don't you tell me what you have
so I can respond.

436
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:26,558
I used to think there was
something wrong here.

437
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:29,134
Now I know there's
something wrong here.

438
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:36,506
Either you don't find anything,
because you don't know how to look...

439
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:41,410
...or you do and they carve you out
and light you on fire.

440
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,477
That's gotta be the play here, right?

441
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,447
Bennett Holiday.

442
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:51,224
Sydney Hewitt's new boy.

443
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,526
How many of those have I seen?

444
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:56,060
Six? Seven?

445
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:58,725
They're all gone.

446
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,460
He's still Sydney-fucking-Hewitt.

447
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,328
Fourteen-11.

448
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:07,064
Match point.

449
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,233
I think they've got someone
inside the deal.

450
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,673
Someone they can squeeze.

451
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,378
You mean like an informant?

452
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:19,576
Yes, sir, like an informant. Just my opinion,
based on their overconfidence.

453
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:21,585
Match point.

454
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,965
Thank you.

455
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,630
You know, if people in oil deals...

456
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:41,366
...talked to U.S. Attorneys,
there'd be no oil business. Dean.

457
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:45,478
Bennett Holiday, you know Dean Whiting,
founding partner of our firm.

458
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,671
-Good to see you, sir.
-How are you?

459
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,442
We've been discussing
the Connex-Killen merger situation.

460
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:53,746
Will they get approval?
Hell of a large company if they do.

461
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,445
I mean, client.

462
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,552
Well, the Tengiz field,
Killen's largest asset...

463
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:02,492
...is being looked into pretty heavily
by the U.S. Attorney's office.

464
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:04,654
Well, Bennett, as they say in the Bible:

465
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:08,165
"There are many, many ways
to light Europe."

466
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:29,683
<i>Yeah, well, there's an arrow on the ceiling
pointing towards Mecca.</i>

467
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,125
The Binladin Group
air-conditioned Mecca.

468
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:36,821
It was a huge project.
They made billions and billions.

469
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:43,398
<i>All the women are dressed in black
from head to toe...</i>

470
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,005
<i>...walking 5 feet behind the men.</i>

471
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:51,605
<i>It's 125.</i>

472
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:54,577
<i>Literally, 125 and humid.</i>

473
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,742
<i>When I walked out of the airport,
it was like a wall fell on me.</i>

474
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:02,788
<i>The men are all wearing white sheets.</i>

475
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:07,326
<i>And they're spotless white sheets.
I don't really understand that.</i>

476
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,418
<i>They kind of say:</i>

477
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,827
<i>"It's hot and I don't have to work. "</i>

478
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,400
<i>I don't understand how
you could do anything in that.</i>

479
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:17,935
<i>I'd like to see these guys play baseball.</i>

480
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,610
Are you okay?

481
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:27,643
<i>You sound strange.</i>

482
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:29,680
No, I'm fine.

483
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,803
They will try to disguise the difference...

484
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:58,409
...to make Muslims who speak
about religion...

485
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,671
...appear to be fanatics
or backward people.

486
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:06,115
They will tell us the dispute is over
economic resources...

487
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:08,248
...or military domination.

488
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:12,219
If we believe that,
we play right into their hands...

489
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:16,761
...with only ourselves to blame.

490
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:18,731
It is not possible...

491
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:21,731
...to bridge the divide
between human nature...

492
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:24,900
...and modern life through free trade.

493
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:26,164
Impossible.

494
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:31,169
The divine and the worldly
are but a single concept.

495
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:33,402
The Koran.

496
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:38,510
No separation of religion and state.

497
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:41,050
The Koran.

498
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:45,219
Instead of kings legislating
and slaves obeying...

499
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:47,720
...the Koran.

500
00:40:48,562 --> 00:40:51,531
The pain of modern life
cannot be cured by...

501
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:53,461
...deregulation...

502
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:54,965
...privatization...

503
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:56,360
...economic reform...

504
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,237
...or lower taxes.

505
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,867
The pain of living in the modern world...

506
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,544
...will never be solved by a liberal society.

507
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:11,343
Liberal societies have failed.

508
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:13,946
Christian theology has failed.

509
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:16,320
The West has failed.

510
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,662
This was a birthday and graduation present
a couple years ago.

511
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,058
Cap d'Antibes, France

512
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,995
What happened was,
I was about to graduate from Oxford...

513
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:31,537
...and my mother had a horse
in the Royal Ascot race, right?

514
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:33,900
The horse won...

515
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,532
...that same day that I was graduating.
And my trust fund matured.

516
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:42,038
So that tops any birthday present that
any of you have bought for me tonight.

517
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:49,688
Capitalism cannot exist without waste.

518
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:53,384
We should write thank-you notes
to Mr. Whiting and the U.S.A...

519
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:56,223
...for producing one-quarter
of the world's garbage...

520
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,592
...and one-quarter of the demand.

521
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:00,797
You're certainly welcome.

522
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:02,697
Our pleasure, really.

523
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,835
Prince...

524
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,640
...is there anything
that we can do for you?

525
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:17,544
Americans are always happy to drill holes
in other people's countries.

526
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:22,917
I've heard of you, Mr. Whiting.
The cat's-paw of the Saudi princes.

527
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:29,793
I know your brother, the foreign minister.
He's very bright.

528
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,226
I know your father too.

529
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,394
He threw the second creepiest party
I've ever been to in Washington.

530
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,038
And as far as I can see...

531
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:42,733
...you could probably use
a bit of the cat's-paw yourself.

532
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:47,079
Second-born son,
so beaten down by his family...

533
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:51,048
...he can't even tell me what he wants
when he's asked straight-out.

534
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:55,382
A grown-up baby
who's afraid of his brother...

535
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,793
...and maybe wants to be king?

536
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:02,156
Maybe?

537
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:05,763
Well, prince...

538
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,762
...are you a king?

539
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,032
Can you tell me what you want?

540
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:18,977
<i>All right, what's next?</i>

541
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:21,341
<i>The lethal finding on Nasir came through.</i>

542
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,983
<i>That was quick. You have a timetable?</i>

543
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:26,984
<i>He'll be in Beirut next week.
We could do it there.</i>

544
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:29,486
<i>That's good. Anybody around?</i>

545
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:32,353
<i>Actually, yes.
I made contact with Mussawi.</i>

546
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,790
<i>He'd be happy to work
with whoever we send.</i>

547
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:38,891
I was thinking it would be good for Bob.

548
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,331
I'll let you have him
without going through Terry...

549
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:48,532
...but everything better go exactly right.

550
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,303
And tell him, "Easy on the memos."

551
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:55,574
This is the prototype
of an oil-rich Arab monarchy.

552
00:43:55,749 --> 00:44:00,186
Since prevailing in the tribal conflicts
of the 1920s...

553
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:04,120
...the Al-Subaai family have ruled
their kingdom effectively...

554
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,851
...and, by most accounts, benignly.

555
00:44:07,027 --> 00:44:11,225
However, they face enormous challenges
in the future.

556
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,458
The fact of the matter is that
at current levels of production....

557
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,603
-Welcome, Bob.
-Hi.

558
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:20,399
Good news. I think we've got something
for you, something you'll like...

559
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:24,874
...that utilizes your specific skill set.

560
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,680
You know this guy?

561
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:32,318
-Prince Nasir Al-Subaai.
-His money's in a lot of dark corners...

562
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:35,887
...paying for weapons
that could be used against the U.S.A.

563
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:40,418
Paperwork on polygraphs.

564
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,323
Wire transfers to Qaeda fronts.

565
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:46,455
Letters instructing his water ministry
to employ Mohammed Sheik Agiza...

566
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,362
...the guy who has your missile.

567
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:51,129
He's traveling to Beirut.
You have experience in Beirut.

568
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:53,068
It's a great city.

569
00:44:53,874 --> 00:44:55,705
This is a bad guy.

570
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:59,375
And, who knows, maybe you'll find
your blue-eyed Egyptian.

571
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,147
-I sent you a report on--
-Sorry, I gotta get going.

572
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:05,444
My daughter's got a soccer game.

573
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,177
Big one.

574
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:11,252
Did you see my missile report?
I reset the guidance to blow 10 feet--

575
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:12,653
Bob, you just don't get it.

576
00:45:13,394 --> 00:45:17,262
Nobody wants to hear about
a missing missile, not right now.

577
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:20,093
This is top of the director's list.

578
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,631
Hit a walk-off home run...

579
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,660
...you get any desk you want.

580
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:29,798
Sheik Hamad has not yet made
a decision about who will succeed him.

581
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,344
In our view, Prince Nasir...

582
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:37,245
...is likely the more ambitious
of the two brothers.

583
00:45:37,418 --> 00:45:39,147
This, however, does not mean...

584
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,847
...that he will prevail
in any succession struggle.

585
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:11,351
Your generosity is bigger than a mountain
that shades us from the burning sun.

586
00:46:11,885 --> 00:46:14,718
My house has grown too small
for my family.

587
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:18,722
If we had more land...

588
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:21,520
...then my son could build his own house.

589
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,978
My father has ordered
the Marbella estate to be razed.

590
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:55,486
There'll be a park.

591
00:46:57,364 --> 00:46:59,992
We're so sorry for your loss.

592
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:16,672
Six more North Field blocks
are being developed.

593
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,049
We'd like to offer your firm the rights.

594
00:47:21,788 --> 00:47:23,551
Six blocks?

595
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:26,488
-Which phase?
-Third phase.

596
00:47:28,128 --> 00:47:30,995
Okay, so we'd be
in the stream for...

597
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:33,632
...10 one-hundredths of a cent.

598
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:37,098
So $ 75 million.

599
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,034
Seventy-- Great. That's great.

600
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:41,231
How much for my other kid?

601
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:51,275
You know, if I were your economic adviser,
I'd tell you that...

602
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,284
...that's not the stupidest thing,
financially, you've done...

603
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:58,220
...but probably just the dumbest thing
you'll do today. Probably.

604
00:47:58,392 --> 00:48:00,360
But why would you need
an economic adviser?

605
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,688
Years ago, you had
the highest GNP in the world.

606
00:48:02,863 --> 00:48:05,798
Today, you're tied with Albania.
So good work.

607
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,560
Your second biggest export
is secondhand goods...

608
00:48:08,735 --> 00:48:12,102
...followed closely by dates,
for which you lose 5 cents a pound.

609
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:14,399
You know what the business world
thinks of you?

610
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:18,443
We think 100 years ago, you were living
in tents, chopping each other's heads off...

611
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:21,012
...and that's exactly where you'll be
in another 100.

612
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:24,116
So, yes, on behalf of my firm,
I accept your money. Thank you.

613
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:27,276
Fine. I'll have the funds
transferred to your firm immediately.

614
00:48:27,454 --> 00:48:28,785
Great.

615
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:31,254
And I'll give you 100 million
for the other kid.

616
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,562
So now you're my economic adviser...

617
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:41,189
...why don't you tell me something
I don't already know.

618
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,034
All right. You want an idea?
Here's an idea.

619
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,969
There's the Eurasian triangle.

620
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:55,706
Your kingdom is here. Iran is there.
You've been selling your oil...

621
00:48:55,882 --> 00:49:01,684
...sticking it on ships and watching
as it sails away around Africa to there.

622
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,154
Pretend for a second that
this is excess Iranian pipeline capacity.

623
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:08,453
That's your route. Right there.
Overland, through Iran.

624
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:11,154
Hook up with these pipes.
Commoditize it, control it...

625
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:13,731
...take it to the doorstep
of every home in Europe.

626
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,700
I just doubled your profit.
I think that's a pretty good idea.

627
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:24,241
777 Ranch
Hondo, Texas

628
00:49:34,588 --> 00:49:37,921
My granddaddy was a wildcatter.
Same with my daddy.

629
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:40,491
That's how I got my start.

630
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:43,019
Luck and hard work.

631
00:49:43,196 --> 00:49:45,096
Nobody handed me shit.

632
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,226
Now I got...

633
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,996
...libraries and parks named after me.

634
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:55,670
And I'll probably ruin my grandkids.

635
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:01,242
You wearing a wire, Bennett?

636
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:03,872
No.

637
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:17,429
Mr. Janus...

638
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:19,991
...chairman of Connex...

639
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,960
...and Dean Whiting,
founding partner of your firm...

640
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:28,169
...are proud members of
the Committee to Liberate Iran.

641
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:30,901
Danny D. here is too.

642
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:33,239
D is for "Dalton."

643
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:37,179
-I was on the other side of the Tengiz deal.
-"The other side"?

644
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:41,081
<i>El Presidente Nazarbayev's best pal
in the whole world.</i>

645
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:43,814
She's a beautiful field, the Tengiz.

646
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:48,291
Goddamn, is she a beautiful field.

647
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,728
What is it? "Irish...."

648
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:56,129
Rockville, Maryland

649
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,534
"The Irish pray on their knees,
the Scots prey on their neighbors."

650
00:51:02,175 --> 00:51:04,143
How's Margaret?

651
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,336
You guys divorced yet?

652
00:51:06,513 --> 00:51:09,641
-We're not getting divorced.
-I don't think, in our line of work...

653
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:14,378
...there's two people with your security
clearances who have made a marriage work.

654
00:51:14,554 --> 00:51:16,454
I'm telling you, Bobby, my boy...

655
00:51:16,623 --> 00:51:18,887
...number three. That's the charm.

656
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:21,357
-That's the number, huh?
-Yeah.

657
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,021
I like consulting.

658
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:27,189
No, I love it.

659
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,628
Love it. And I'll say this for it:

660
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:32,795
Private business is efficient.

661
00:51:33,206 --> 00:51:34,969
There, I've said it. Fucking cliché.

662
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:38,908
And the CIA is, like, what,
a 30-billion-a-year business...

663
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,071
...so anybody who wants to sell anything,
a pencil, a computer...

664
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:46,310
...they gotta interface through
a security clearance. Don't give me shit.

665
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:50,582
I got two kids in college,
and we're doing our kitchen.

666
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:54,491
Stan, I got a chance to go back to Beirut.

667
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,692
I wanna go back.

668
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,993
Is it safe for me?

669
00:52:02,302 --> 00:52:05,135
Are we talking about with your wife
or with the wackos?

670
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:15,106
Clear it with Hezbollah.

671
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:29,658
Hezbollah-controlled suburb
Beirut, Lebanon

672
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,134
Said Hashimi. Said Hashimi.

673
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:12,896
Said Hashimi.

674
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:15,701
I'm Canadian. It's okay. Canadian.

675
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:17,270
Said Hashimi.

676
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,403
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

677
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:23,477
It's okay.

678
00:54:21,741 --> 00:54:25,609
I have a good feeling
about American people, Bob.

679
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:27,707
A good people.

680
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:31,983
There are 10 million Muslims
in the U.S.

681
00:54:35,121 --> 00:54:37,180
Thank you for this audience.

682
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,951
I have a business proposal for Mussawi,
one that benefits everyone.

683
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:44,258
Mussawi is an energetic young man.

684
00:54:44,664 --> 00:54:47,462
Your Arabic is very good.

685
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:53,236
I thought it would be prudent to say that
I have no interest in Hezbollah.

686
00:54:53,473 --> 00:54:56,067
This is business
and it doesn't concern Hezbollah.

687
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:07,648
If what you say is true...

688
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:11,015
...consider yourself welcome in Lebanon.

689
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:15,761
They can lift 10 times their weight,
and jump 20 times their height.

690
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:17,760
But I still don't understand....

691
00:55:18,031 --> 00:55:21,228
The spider is a symbol
of the sin of man.

692
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:24,432
He bites the finger of Peter Parker...

693
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:27,300
...who is now half dark and half light.

694
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:33,878
A real spider captures, stings
and immobilizes...

695
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:39,247
...then watches
as the prey takes days to die.

696
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:43,478
They'd never show that.

697
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:51,953
Are we in trouble?

698
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:53,429
Peace be upon you, boys.

699
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:55,596
No, it's not a problem.

700
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:58,559
Look around you...

701
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:05,075
...at your brothers united by faith in God
and submission to his law.

702
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:14,410
We're all brothers.

703
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:16,214
We're one family.

704
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,684
Wasim is still a virgin.

705
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:21,250
That is good.

706
00:56:22,062 --> 00:56:23,927
Fornication is a serious crime.

707
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,124
I'm a virgin too.

708
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,066
That is good as well.

709
00:56:31,037 --> 00:56:32,664
"Abstain from sex out of wedlock.

710
00:56:32,906 --> 00:56:34,567
It is an attack on honor...

711
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:36,208
...and shows contempt for sanctity."

712
00:56:36,376 --> 00:56:38,003
God has spoken the truth.

713
00:56:40,413 --> 00:56:43,075
Let us pray together.

714
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,957
Rumors of Bob, but never Bob.

715
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,194
It is "Bob," right?

716
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,602
What is it you tell people
you do these days, Bob?

717
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,799
Between State Department and Defense.

718
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,342
It's just me, buddy.

719
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:36,577
As requested.

720
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:41,486
I'm gonna get
some information out, Jimmy.

721
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,488
-My name is Mussawi.
-Okay, Jimmy.

722
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,868
He's traveling in Beirut.

723
00:57:57,374 --> 00:58:00,070
It's dangerous to travel. He'll disappear.

724
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:08,581
Take him from his hotel, drug him,
put him in the front of a car...

725
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:11,812
...and run a truck into him
at 50 miles an hour.

726
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,355
It's good to have you back in town, Bob.

727
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,419
<i>We begin the process of empowering
a new generation of Arabs....</i>

728
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,026
Beirut.

729
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,561
No, no. He invited me
to come with him.

730
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,998
I think he thinks he's some kind
of reformer or something.

731
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,460
Anyway, he's got a nice private plane.

732
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,665
Hold on, Vincent.

733
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,776
Hey.

734
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:15,083
Beirut? It's great. It's like the....

735
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:18,415
It's like the Paris of the Middle East.

736
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,886
Yeah, it's like-- It's like winning the NIT.

737
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,686
<i>--however, unlike Washington's
Greater Middle East Initiative...</i>

738
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,852
It's a bad-- Just never mind, never mind.

739
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:31,189
<i>...we respect each country's right
to move at its own pace.</i>

740
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,232
Make room.

741
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,349
American?

742
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:23,914
Canadian.

743
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:26,681
Don't see many Occidentals these days.

744
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,769
It's too bad.

745
01:02:54,746 --> 01:02:56,373
Go, go, go.

746
01:03:40,225 --> 01:03:43,251
-This is November, '94.
-Yeah. Excellent, excellent.

747
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:46,226
-Did you find the others?
-I couldn't. Joe's looking for it.

748
01:03:46,398 --> 01:03:48,958
-He'll bring it out when he does.
-Where is he?

749
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:51,329
He's back there looking.
He'll bring them out.

750
01:03:51,503 --> 01:03:53,300
Okay. Thank you, Susan.

751
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:03,714
Hello?

752
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,611
Yeah.

753
01:04:05,784 --> 01:04:07,411
Who's this?

754
01:04:12,324 --> 01:04:14,849
Yeah. Okay.

755
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:21,927
How you doing, sir?

756
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,227
Somebody called me.

757
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:29,000
If you find me, call my son
Bennett junior at this number.

758
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,300
Bob.

759
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,100
What do you know about
torture methods...

760
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,900
...used by the Chinese
on the Falun Gong?

761
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,200
Method number one.

762
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,700
What's your guess?

763
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,400
Water dungeon.

764
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,900
Did you guess water dungeon?

765
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,100
Number two method?

766
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,500
Number two, twisting arm
and putting face in feces.

767
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,700
Not interested in two.

768
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,800
Number three.

769
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,700
Number three is called...

770
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,300
..."pulling nails from fingers."

771
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,000
What do you think, Bob?

772
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,000
Number three sound good to you?

773
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,700
The purpose is to get the monks
or whatever...

774
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,500
...to recant their beliefs.

775
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,600
What if I had to get you to recant?

776
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,800
That'd be pretty difficult, right?

777
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,900
Because...

778
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:06,200
...if you have no beliefs
to recant, then what?

779
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,100
Well, then, you're fucked is what.

780
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,900
Bob.

781
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,700
You're gonna give me the names...

782
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,200
...of every person
that's taken money from you.

783
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,900
Oh, that is disgusting.

784
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,200
Come on, Jimmy,
you're not a Koran-thumper.

785
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,900
My name is Mussawi.

786
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,100
You fucking fuck, fucking fuck,
stupid fuck!

787
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,900
What the fuck? This is a war.

788
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,700
Fuck! You're a PO-fucking-W!
Give me the fucking names!

789
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,900
Fuck it.

790
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,600
I'm cutting his fucking head off.

791
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,800
I'm gonna cut your head off, Bob.

792
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,600
Said Hashimi is very angry with you,
Mussawi.

793
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,900
Said Hashimi keeps his word.

794
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,900
You're a guest of Hezbollah too, Mussawi.

795
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,300
I'm going to show you
something really cool.

796
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,600
American-made. Good quality...

797
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,700
...but nearly impossible to hit anything.

798
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,800
By shaping the charge...

799
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,100
...this will send a blast
of molten copper...

800
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,700
...through 30 inches of steel.

801
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,900
Careful!

802
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's very dangerous.

803
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,900
Jane.

804
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,600
We've just received a dispatch
from Damascus, eight minutes old.

805
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,300
Mussawi's shopping a story
that we sent Bob to Beirut...

806
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,700
...to assassinate Prince Nasir.

807
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,600
We better go talk to Terry.

808
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,800
Can we get this guy?
I mean now, real-time now.

809
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,700
-Mussawi?
-I'll call you back.

810
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,200
The practical answer is no.
Not before he goes into another mosque...

811
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,000
...or a newspaper
and the story gains traction. No.

812
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,500
-He have Bob's name?
-Not his real name.

813
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,400
Mussawi's shopping photos
of them doing the deal, long lens.

814
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,100
Photos of Bob being held.
We're lucky this guy is alive.

815
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,700
The whole contact was a setup.
Mussawi now apparently works with Iran.

816
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,300
First he tortures our guy,
then he peddles the CIA connection.

817
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,900
Put some space between us and Bob.

818
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,100
Bob has a long history
of entrepreneurial operations.

819
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,500
We haven't really had a handle
on Bob for years.

820
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,500
After 9/11, some people got leeway,
let their emotions get the best of them.

821
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,100
These are complex times.

822
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,800
There's already an active investigation
into Bob's activities in-- Help me out here.

823
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,900
Tehran, the Amiri brothers job.

824
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,800
We're finding out who hired Bob
for the Amiri brothers job.

825
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,300
Could the same people
be behind the Nasir job?

826
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,300
A lot of people probably want
this Nasir dead...

827
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,000
...and Bob knows lots of people.
Fill in the rest.

828
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,600
Send me everything.

829
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,700
Walter Reed Hospital
Washington, DC

830
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,200
<i>You first established contact
with the Amiri brothers in 1998?</i>

831
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,600
<i>Yeah.</i>

832
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,100
<i>-You met them at a party in France?
-Yes.</i>

833
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,200
<i>A party given by Reza Reyhani?</i>

834
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,000
<i>Reza, yes.</i>

835
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,400
<i>Were you aware they were
in illegal arms trade?</i>

836
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,500
<i>Of course I was aware.
That's why I went.</i>

837
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,800
<i>Were you aware these two men
were Iranian intelligence officers?</i>

838
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,200
-What do you think?
-This is a diplomatic incident.

839
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,900
Two men have been murdered.

840
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,400
We've been tasked
with the damage assessment.

841
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,400
We'll need you to turn
your passport over to us.

842
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,700
Passports.

843
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,000
Hey.

844
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,500
Hey, I found this.

845
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,100
Wire transfer.

846
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,000
In Russian. I don't speak Russian.

847
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,500
Get it translated.

848
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,100
Do you speak Russian?

849
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,800
-These are dead.
-Oh, thanks.

850
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,300
What are these?

851
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,800
Orphans. You know,
things that don't make any sense.

852
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,600
That one's pretty interesting.

853
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,700
The Lily School.
It's a boarding school in Switzerland.

854
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,600
Paid for by wire transfer.

855
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,500
The meeting's already started.
You're not on the list.

856
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,900
This is not an open function.
You're not wearing a badge.

857
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,100
You don't have a wristband.

858
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,800
This is a private gathering.

859
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:27,300
Take this to Sydney Hewitt.

860
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,800
<i>They are pushing
for the segregation of universities.</i>

861
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,300
Please.

862
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,800
<i>And the banning of the wearing
of colorful clothing.</i>

863
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,500
<i>But two-thirds of Iran's population
is under 30.</i>

864
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:42,900
How you doing?

865
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,600
<i>More than 60 percent
of university students are women.</i>

866
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,600
<i>And those restrictions
are like a small pebble...</i>

867
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,000
<i>...in front of a massive tidal wave
of reform.</i>

868
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,800
<i>Iranian resources are abundant...</i>

869
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,100
<i>...and given the chance,
there is no limit...</i>

870
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,900
<i>...to what the Iranian people can achieve.</i>

871
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,800
<i>Their hopes are the same
as all people in every land...</i>

872
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,700
<i>...to live lives of dignity
in a nation at peace.</i>

873
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,400
<i>And America will help them.</i>

874
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,000
Killen Oil, through Daniel Dalton
and Petroika Energy Consultants...

875
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,000
...created assetless shell companies...

876
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,500
...owned by the heirs
of Nurzan Detayev...

877
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,400
...Republic of Kazakhstan's
minister of Domestic Resources.

878
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,000
This was discussed
at the Upstream Division meeting...

879
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,100
...in January, 2003 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

880
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,900
I was at the meeting,
but I don't focus on those details.

881
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,200
Wherein it was described
that Killen bore all financial risk...

882
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,700
...but Minister Detayev's children, while
attending The Lily School in Switzerland...

883
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,900
...were entitled to all of the profits.
Seventy million dollars.

884
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,600
I attended the meeting, but as I said,
I don't focus on those kind of details.

885
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,000
Further, Daniel Dalton Jr.
and Petroika Energy Consultants colluded--

886
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,100
A firm retained by Killen
prior to Connex's involvement.

887
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,500
Oh, for chrissake, Tommy.
We both got letters from the grand jury.

888
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,400
-It's not your own private pity party.
-A good faith purchaser is in good faith...

889
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,900
...only if they didn't know of the problems
at the time of the purchase.

890
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,700
This is the oil business
we're talking about?

891
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:10,800
Lowliest little shareholder knows we deal
with the most stank places on earth.

892
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,900
And it is illegal to offer gifts, money...

893
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,800
...the promise of money or anything
of value to influence foreign officials.

894
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,200
Is it?

895
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,500
I have personally seen a bill
from your law firm...

896
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,400
...to the government of Saudi Arabia
for $36 million.

897
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,900
A one-line bill for "services rendered."

898
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:33,100
The business of Whiting Sloan
is not under discussion at this time.

899
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,000
Well, it ought to be.

900
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,000
Danny's a good man.

901
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,000
And he's a friend of mine.

902
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,800
A Mareva injunction?

903
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,100
Some people, cousins of mine, actually,
sued my father in the Commonwealth...

904
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,500
Geneva, Switzerland

905
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,900
...alleging he broke an agreement
to repay funds from the state.

906
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,200
It calls them "aggrieved royals."
Aggrieved about what?

907
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,400
That he tried to cut their allowances
from 100,000 a month to 80?

908
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,100
I want to see my father.

909
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,000
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

910
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,900
Your father is not feeling well.

911
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:33,300
My cousins aren't bright enough
to be anything but finger puppets...

912
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:40,300
...and my brother has faith
only in his own cunning.

913
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:49,300
What do you suppose they're up to,
my brother and these American lawyers?

914
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,200
Tell me...

915
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,000
...what are they thinking?

916
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,600
What are they thinking?

917
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,000
What are they thinking?

918
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,000
They're thinking that it's running out.

919
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,100
It's running out.

920
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:11,100
And 90 percent of what's left
is in the Middle East.

921
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,500
Look at the progression.

922
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:20,000
Versailles, Suez, 1973,
Gulf War One, Gulf War Two.

923
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,200
This is a fight to the death.

924
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,300
So, what are they thinking? "Great."

925
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,400
They're thinking, "Keep playing,
keep buying yourself new toys.

926
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,700
Keep spending $50,000 a night
on your hotel room.

927
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,900
But don't invest in your infrastructure.

928
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,500
Don't build a real economy."

929
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:40,200
So that when you finally wake up,
they will have sucked you dry...

930
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,100
...and you will have squandered
the greatest natural resource in history.

931
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,600
Come with me, please.

932
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,500
I studied at Oxford.
I have a Ph.D. from Georgetown.

933
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,200
I want to create a parliament.

934
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,200
I want to give women the right to vote.

935
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,300
I want an independent judiciary.

936
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,200
I want to start a petroleum exchange
in the Middle East...

937
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,700
...cut the speculators
out of the business.

938
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,800
Why are the major oil exchanges
in London and New York anyway?

939
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,700
I'll put all of our energy
up for competitive bidding.

940
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,600
I'll run pipe through Iran to Europe,
like you proposed.

941
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,500
I'll ship to China.

942
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,600
Anything that achieves efficiency
and maximizes profit.

943
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,100
Profit which I will then use
to rebuild my country.

944
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:31,100
-Great, that's exactly what you should do.
-Exactly.

945
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:35,700
Except your president
rings my father and says:

946
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:42,200
"I've got unemployment in Texas,
Kansas, Washington state."

947
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,300
A phone call later, we're stealing
out of our social programs...

948
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,200
...in order to buy overpriced airplanes.

949
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,300
We owed the Americans,
but we've repaid that debt.

950
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,300
I accepted a Chinese bid,
the highest bid...

951
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,700
...and suddenly I'm a terrorist.
I'm a godless communist.

952
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,800
Dean Whiting...

953
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,600
...who represents not only these
aggrieved royals and my brother...

954
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,300
...but also Connex Oil...

955
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,700
...they've been pressuring my father
to invalidate the Chinese contract.

956
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,800
But they underestimate him.

957
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,400
This is about his legacy to his people.

958
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,300
I know it seems like
people sitting in hotel rooms.

959
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,200
That's how they do business.

960
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,500
But we're--
We're talking world historical stage here.

961
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:36,200
I mean, with the-- With the delivery deals
we could make in Europe...

962
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,700
...transport through Iran.

963
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:41,800
This guy might be able to revolutionize
not just his country, but the whole region.

964
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:46,800
As soon as his father keels over,
this guy could be like Mossadegh in '52...

965
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,100
...in Iran. The real democracy
rising up organically.

966
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,700
If we can be a part of
any of these countries...

967
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,200
...getting a parliament,
helping them find efficiency, showing--

968
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,600
-You know, showing them how--
-Stop it. Stop it.

969
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,300
Julie, the little company
that I started working for...

970
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,000
...is now chief economic adviser
to Prince Nasir.

971
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,800
Do you understand what that means?

972
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,400
It's like...

973
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,800
...somebody put a giant ATM
on our front lawn.

974
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,400
Here's a question:

975
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:20,300
How do you think it looks to profit
off the death of your 6-year-old?

976
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,600
Fuck you.

977
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,800
Fuck you.

978
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,000
I changed the diapers.
I put cream on rashes.

979
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,300
I took him to his checkups.

980
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,300
I cared about every fucking percentile.

981
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,000
I did everything right.
I did everything right.

982
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
We're going back to the States.

983
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,900
Good.

984
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,600
Riley?

985
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,100
Sweetie, sweetie, be careful.

986
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,300
We're gonna go now, okay?

987
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,900
You wanna say goodbye to your dad?

988
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,800
You can see him later, okay?

989
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:41,400
<i>When I die I want the people who inherit
my possessions to do the following.</i>

990
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:42,700
<i>One...</i>

991
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,900
<i>...the people who prepare my body
should be good Muslims...</i>

992
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,900
<i>...so this will remind me of God
and his forgiveness.</i>

993
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,100
<i>Two...</i>

994
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,400
<i>...I don't want anyone to rip their clothes
or slap their faces...</i>

995
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,500
<i>...because this is an ignorant thing to do.</i>

996
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,900
<i>Three...</i>

997
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:04,400
<i>...I don't want a pregnant woman to come
and say goodbye to me...</i>

998
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,400
<i>...because I don't approve it.</i>

999
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,500
<i>Four....</i>

1000
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,900
<i>Some trust-fund prosecutor
got off message at Yale...</i>

1001
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,200
<i>...thinks he's gonna run this
up the flagpole?</i>

1002
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,700
<i>Make a name for himself?</i>

1003
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,800
<i>Maybe get elected some two-bit
congressman from nowhere...</i>

1004
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,000
<i>...with the result that China or Russia...</i>

1005
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,300
<i>...can suddenly start having,
at our expense...</i>

1006
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,200
<i>...all the advantages we enjoy here?</i>

1007
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,800
No, I tell you. No, sir.

1008
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,200
Corruption charges. Corruption?

1009
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,600
Corruption is government intrusion...

1010
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,500
...into market efficiencies
in the form of regulation.

1011
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:43,400
That's Milton Friedman.
He got a goddamn Nobel Prize.

1012
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,900
We have laws against it precisely
so we can get away with it.

1013
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,800
Corruption is our protection.

1014
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,300
Corruption keeps us safe and warm!

1015
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,300
Corruption is why you and I are
prancing around in here...

1016
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,400
...instead of fighting over scraps of meat
out in the street.

1017
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,800
Corruption is why we win.

1018
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,100
<i>How'd it go?</i>

1019
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,400
Well, he's got kids, a wife.

1020
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,000
He broke the law.

1021
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,600
Mr. Janus himself wanted me
to extend you an invitation...

1022
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
...to Oilman of the Year.

1023
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,000
He's being honored...

1024
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,500
...so it should be a nice weekend.

1025
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:25,700
Relax. Catch yourself a massage.

1026
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,000
Congratulations.

1027
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,400
-Is Jane in?
-She's in a meeting.

1028
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,800
How about Fred?

1029
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,800
He's in a meeting.

1030
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,100
Bennett, hey.

1031
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,100
Come on, take a ride with me.

1032
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,900
Do I have a choice, Don?

1033
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,400
Of course you do.
This is just a courtesy call.

1034
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:54,100
I know you know about the crime-fraud
exception to attorney-client privilege.

1035
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,700
I do, Don. Very well.

1036
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:59,400
Then you also know your client
is into some shady stuff...

1037
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,200
...and it's starting to look like
you could be involved...

1038
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,600
...in hiding the true nature
of the transactions.

1039
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,300
That's quite a statement, Don.

1040
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,700
One word:

1041
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:18,400
Dalton.

1042
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,200
Danny Dalton?

1043
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,700
Defrauded the government of Kazakhstan
of funds to which it was entitled.

1044
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,300
Defrauded the people of Kazakhstan
of the right to the honest services...

1045
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,600
...of their elected and appointed officials.

1046
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,300
Seven years. Does three,
maybe two and a half...

1047
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,900
-...on your recommendation.
-Now, let me guess.

1048
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,200
This was a solo act, without
the knowledge of Connex or Killen Oil...

1049
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,000
...and Mr. Lee Janus or Jimmy Pope.

1050
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,900
Dalton's a bit of a rogue, it's true.

1051
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,800
And he'll have a nice little trust fund
when he gets out.

1052
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,200
Not so little, I imagine.

1053
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,600
Look, Don, we can spend
the next five years in court...

1054
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,100
...to get back to the very place
that we're at right now.

1055
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,400
And they will fight tough.

1056
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,000
They'll fight dirty.

1057
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,500
They'll pressure your boss...

1058
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,600
...the people who appointed your boss...

1059
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,100
...the wives of the people
who appointed your boss.

1060
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,900
And you will never hit them any harder
than this, and you know it.

1061
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,500
I'm sorry, Bennett.

1062
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,400
I don't think Dalton's enough.

1063
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,200
What are you looking at, man?

1064
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,400
-I didn't say anything.
-That's because you have nothing to say.

1065
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
You fucking asshole.

1066
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,800
There we go.

1067
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,500
Okay, pal.

1068
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,800
Come on. Yeah, I know.
I know, I know, I know.

1069
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,800
-Hey, Fred!
-You've been such a good boy.

1070
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,200
Fred.

1071
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,500
Hey, Bob.

1072
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,200
There you go, pal.
I tell you what, Katie, take that in.

1073
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,200
Hey, Jack. Your sister.

1074
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,200
You first.

1075
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,500
Take the kids inside.
I'll be right in, okay?

1076
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,100
What's going on, Fred?

1077
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,400
It's okay. Be in in a sec.

1078
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,200
FBI's got it, Bob. That's pretty clear.

1079
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,300
Nothing I can do, you know it.
It's a criminal investigation.

1080
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,000
-Two men were killed.
-I was almost killed.

1081
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:20,700
Now they're asking me questions
about the Amiri brothers, about Tehran.

1082
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:25,100
Understand, this wrecks careers.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

1083
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:29,000
I punched in "Prince Nasir Al-Subaai,"
and my computer gets seized.

1084
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,000
Where'd that job come from?
Where did the Nasir job come from?

1085
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
I'm advising you to drop it.

1086
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,000
Why am I being investigated?

1087
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,600
Why am I being investigated, Fred?

1088
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,400
Goodbye, Bob.

1089
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,800
It's okay. Hey, hey.

1090
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,900
What's up?

1091
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,200
If I truly lack faith...

1092
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,400
...then I am not the right person.

1093
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,700
The questioning means
that you have faith...

1094
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,800
...and makes it stronger.

1095
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,800
That's a lot of shit, I think.

1096
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,000
We'll be able to intervene in the
affairs of family members.

1097
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,100
We'll be able to help them with
whatever they need.

1098
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,200
You'll be able to get your mother here.

1099
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,000
Please.

1100
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,800
I am tired.

1101
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,400
Father...

1102
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:53,100
...who will be emir?

1103
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,100
Your brother.

1104
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,700
Praise be to God.

1105
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:05,300
I would ask you to remain
as foreign minister.

1106
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,800
You cannot do this.

1107
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:13,400
He is barely qualified to run a brothel,
much less a country.

1108
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,800
I like Europe.

1109
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,700
I will be happy to stay here.

1110
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,300
My decision is final...

1111
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,100
...and I ask you to support your brother.

1112
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,900
I cannot do that.

1113
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:53,300
For centuries Arabs have been ruled by
people with no respect for law...

1114
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:57,300
...monopolies handed out for the
things that people want...

1115
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:01,900
...commerce stifled, young people
unable to find jobs.

1116
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,700
Anyone who criticizes is thrown in jail...

1117
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,700
...or put to death.

1118
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,100
And women...

1119
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:16,200
...are treated as second-class citizens.

1120
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,900
The coronation is tomorrow, and your
brother has the support of the Americans.

1121
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:25,300
And 10,000 of their troops
are stationed in our country.

1122
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,600
True.

1123
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:34,600
My father is ill and weak, and unwilling
to oppose the Americans.

1124
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,200
But others are willing.

1125
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:43,200
When a country has 5 percent
of the world's population...

1126
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:48,200
...but does 50 percent
of its military spending...

1127
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:55,500
...then the persuasive powers of that
country are on the decline.

1128
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,100
<i>They're worried.</i>

1129
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,400
<i>About fallout. They're worried...</i>

1130
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,500
...you might wanna talk about it.

1131
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,400
But if you're already
under investigation....

1132
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,700
What about Mussawi?

1133
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,300
He's a soldier.

1134
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:30,900
He's just like you.

1135
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,600
Why are they doing a damage assessment
on the Amiris and on me for doing my job?

1136
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:45,800
This is about our interests in the region.

1137
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:53,400
So if Prince Nasir won't allow
our military bases in his country...

1138
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,300
...and his little brother will...

1139
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,100
...well, we'll probably have to
do something about that.

1140
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:05,800
Who's worried about the Nasir job?

1141
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,500
Who's worried about me talking?

1142
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,200
Stan.

1143
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:20,900
Who's worried?

1144
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,400
Hello?

1145
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,700
<i>Hello, is this Mr. Whitting?</i>

1146
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,600
<i>This is Homeseal Security.</i>

1147
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,800
Yes, this is Mr. Whiting.

1148
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,500
<i>Hi, we're showing a motion-sensor failure
in your downstairs study.</i>

1149
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:50,900
Yes?

1150
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,600
<i>Like I said, we're getting
a failure message.</i>

1151
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,800
<i>Want me to stay on the phone
while you walk around, or send a car?</i>

1152
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,400
I'll walk around.

1153
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:32,200
Everything seems fine.

1154
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,300
<i>How are we doing, Mr. Whiting?</i>

1155
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,400
Everything's fine.

1156
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:00,200
<i>-The door's unlocked.
-Did you leave it unlocked?</i>

1157
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,300
Send a car, you imbecile.

1158
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,200
You were in Beirut in '84.

1159
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,200
I lost friends there...

1160
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,000
...as I'm sure you did.

1161
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:54,400
I got a peek at your file.
You're a good man.

1162
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:59,300
One whose experience
is narrow and deep.

1163
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,600
Your entire career...

1164
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,600
...you've been used.

1165
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:08,300
And probably never even known
what for.

1166
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:11,300
I didn't use to need to know.

1167
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:16,100
In this town, you're innocent
until you're investigated.

1168
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:22,500
Innocent until investigated? That's nice.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1169
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:27,500
I bet you've worn some miles
on little sayings like that.

1170
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,300
Thank you.

1171
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,400
-Thank you.
-No.

1172
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,100
Gives the listener the sense of the law
being written as it's spoken.

1173
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,700
If anything happens to me or my family...

1174
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:48,000
...an accident, an accusation, anything...

1175
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:51,600
...then, first, your son will disappear.

1176
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,800
His body will never be found.
Then your wife.

1177
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:59,200
Her body will never be found either.
Now, this is guaranteed.

1178
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,400
Then whatever is the most dangerous
thing that you do...

1179
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,700
...it might be flying in a small plane...

1180
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:07,300
...might be walking to the bank...

1181
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,300
...you'll be killed.

1182
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,500
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1183
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,500
I want you to acknowledge
that you do understand...

1184
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:21,200
...so that we're clear
and there won't be any mistakes.

1185
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:26,300
Beirut rules, Mr. Barnes?

1186
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,200
I want my passports back.

1187
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
We are a small group...

1188
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:16,600
...the ones who carry convictions
and ambitions.

1189
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:19,900
And within this group...

1190
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,700
...there is another, smaller group...

1191
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:25,900
...who flee from the worldly life...

1192
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:29,400
...in order to spread the true faith.

1193
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,400
You're ready.

1194
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:46,500
<i>Connex-Killen Oil announces the gift
of a new children's hospital...</i>

1195
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,200
<i>...to be built in honor of the new emir.</i>

1196
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,300
I wanted to be on a bobsled
in the Olympics.

1197
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,700
What's a bobsled?

1198
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,300
Wasim knows what a bobsled is.

1199
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,700
Papa, I need to ask you....

1200
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,900
Tell him about the bobsled!

1201
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,000
Tell him what a bobsled is.

1202
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,700
It's a little car.

1203
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,300
A little car that goes down a track
of ice and snow.

1204
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,000
Papa, may I borrow some money
for the bus?

1205
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:21,900
Oh, how the snow sparkles,
the crunch of it under your feet....

1206
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,700
Dalton's not enough.

1207
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,000
I would be real careful.

1208
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,500
You dig a 6-foot hole,
you'll find three bodies.

1209
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:03,300
But you dig 12, and maybe you'll find 40.

1210
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:08,800
China's economy ain't growing
as fast as it could...

1211
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,200
...because they can't get
all the oil they need.

1212
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,800
Now, I'm damn proud of that fact.

1213
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,000
We need another body, Mr. Pope.

1214
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,300
What if--?

1215
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:29,000
What if it involved somebody
at your firm?

1216
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,500
Someone way the hell above you.

1217
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:39,500
We'd have to have an understanding.

1218
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:48,500
Well...

1219
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,100
...if....

1220
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:55,300
If he's as big as you say...

1221
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:59,500
...then when he goes down,
the merger will be approved.

1222
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,600
Just like that?

1223
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:09,700
We're looking for the illusion
of due diligence, Mr. Pope.

1224
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:13,100
Two criminal acts
successfully prosecuted...

1225
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,400
...it gives us that illusion.

1226
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,700
Call me Jimmy.

1227
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:21,400
He's a visionary. He's like Faisal or Atatürk.
The people love him. And he's--

1228
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,600
The country's gonna be his by Monday.

1229
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,700
It's not like you guys have backed
the wrong horse here.

1230
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,800
No, no. No, look,
he's got nine of 11 generals.

1231
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:47,900
We're on our way to the palace right now.
This is really happening.

1232
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:54,800
Silver Range Rover.

1233
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,400
<i>With a sunroof.</i>

1234
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,900
Silver Range Rover, sunroof,
fourth from lead.

1235
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:03,600
-Guys, help me out here.
-It's coming now.

1236
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,300
His wife will be there. Pat.

1237
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:37,000
This is good.

1238
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:39,900
You done good.

1239
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,500
Lee, you have guests.

1240
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,100
-Syd.
-Leland.

1241
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,400
-Bennett Holiday.
-How are you, sir?

1242
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,800
-Lee Janus. How are we doing?
-Well.

1243
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,100
Those number crunchers can get
a little overzealous, can't they?

1244
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:10,800
Christ, when we write the GAAP rules
like some sort of abstract painting...

1245
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:14,200
...you stare at that liability
hard enough...

1246
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:17,300
...and before long, it'll turn into an asset.

1247
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,000
No, thank you.

1248
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:24,500
-You don't drink?
-No.

1249
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,900
It is really beautiful out here.

1250
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:47,000
-What is that?
-What?

1251
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:48,800
In front of them.

1252
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:23,200
The Bedouin always have right of way.

1253
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,100
Lawyers say, "If you can't trust
a Big Five accounting firm...."

1254
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:29,200
The accountants say,
"We're not lawyers."

1255
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:32,100
Legal didn't understand.
Accounting didn't understand.

1256
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:35,700
Nobody understood anything.
Regulatory bodies scratched their heads...

1257
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:38,100
...that nobody at Connex or Killen
was at fault.

1258
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:41,500
But this merger is so balance-positive
for American consumers...

1259
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,500
...that, ultimately, Justice wants it.

1260
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:47,100
Federal courts want it.
Everybody wants it.

1261
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:51,300
Our real client, after all,
is us, the American people.

1262
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:56,100
And we are increasing American access
to oil in Kazakhstan.

1263
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:59,800
So all they ask is that we give them
a little something meaningful...

1264
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,500
...which we did.

1265
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:03,900
And they got out of our way.

1266
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,400
Something besides Dalton?

1267
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,700
Unfortunately, yes.

1268
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:12,800
And the best option seemed to be...

1269
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,700
...a secret deal for excess
Iranian pipeline capacity...

1270
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,300
...that I uncovered during the diligence.

1271
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,700
A little side deal benefiting
the lead lawyer...

1272
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,500
...involved in the Connex-Killen
merger approval process.

1273
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:26,100
What...

1274
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,800
...do you think you're doing?

1275
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:30,700
It's illegal for an American
to control these rights.

1276
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,800
Stop right now.

1277
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,400
Is there...

1278
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:41,600
...something that
you wanna tell me, Syd?

1279
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,400
Connex/ Al-Salwa LNG loading facility
The Persian Gulf

1280
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,000
Good afternoon.

1281
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:07,700
I wanna thank our host
for a wonderful spread.

1282
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:10,300
The strawberry juice is delicious.

1283
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:16,400
Let me just say,
on behalf of Connex-Killen...

1284
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,800
...how pleased we are
to be back in the Gulf.

1285
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,700
Your Highness?
Why don't you ride together.

1286
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:46,200
Oh, thank you, Bryan.

1287
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,500
Ladies and gentlemen...

1288
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:15,000
...this year's Oilman of the Year:

1289
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:19,900
Mr. Leland Janus of Connex-Killen.

1290
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,000
Who the hell is that?

1291
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,300
Excuse me. Hey, are you seeing that?

1292
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:28,000
Hey!

1293
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,100
Hey!

1294
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,100
Could you tell who that is?

1295
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,700
Hey! Hey!

1296
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,900
No, no, no! No!

1297
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,800
-Take the target out.
-Roger.

1298
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:45,100
Four miles.

1299
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,300
Two miles.

1300
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:15,100
You're the Canadian.

1301
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:23,800
Target destroyed.

1302
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,600
23:44 EDT.

1303
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:45,700
I'd like to accept this award...

1304
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:51,400
...on behalf of the employees
of Connex-Killen.

1305
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:56,300
Our people, the finest in the world.

1306
01:54:56,400 --> 01:55:00,800
Guys, could I get you to stand up
for a moment? Please stand up.

1307
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,700
Connex-Killen.

1308
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,500
And I'd also like to thank...

1309
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:49,200
...our strategic friends from
around the globe who are here tonight.

1310
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:51,500
Most especially...

1311
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,800
...Emir Meshal Al-Subaai.

1312
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,900
Emir. Thank you so much.

1313
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:46,900
<i>During the funeral...</i>

1314
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:49,700
<i>...I want everyone to be quiet...</i>

1315
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:53,100
<i>...and I should be lying on my right side.</i>

1316
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:58,300
<i>You should throw dust on my body
three times while saying:</i>

1317
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:01,400
<i>"From the dust we are created...</i>

1318
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:04,400
<i>...and to dust we return.</i>

1319
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:08,000
<i>From the dust a new person
will be created. "</i>

1320
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:04,300
<i>Everyone should mention that
I died pure of heart...</i>

1321
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:07,700
<i>...and that the next world is the true life.</i>

1322
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:17,600
<i>The next world is the true life.</i>

1323
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:30,500
Come on, man.

1324
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,700
Leave the beer.
