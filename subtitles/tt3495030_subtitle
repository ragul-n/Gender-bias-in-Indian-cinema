1
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,253
HEAVE-HO, CARRY THAT LOAD

2
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,089
Three things in this world...

3
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,897
...bring tears to my eyes

4
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,001
Papa's shoe

5
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,260
English exams

6
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,232
And singer Kumar Sanu's voice

7
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,105
All painful

8
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,694
You...

9
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:34,410
You are the answer to
my every question

10
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:51,486
You are the heart
of all my stories

11
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,168
Didn't I tell you?

12
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,834
Don't record with headphones.
You'll burst your ear-drums

13
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,275
- What did you say?
- What did I say?

14
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,080
The Rishikesh priest asked us
to see the girl

15
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,980
He wants us to come to
the temple tomorrow

16
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,256
Finish the recording today

17
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,760
What is this mess?
Throw this out

18
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:33,656
Yes, Papa

19
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,292
Here's 20 rupees

20
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,761
Yes, Papa

21
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,528
Don't let the cows get into
the shop

22
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,465
Yes, Papa

23
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,508
Jaya! Did you bring the lemon pickle?

24
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,086
Have you got money
for the temple?

25
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,895
Prem, get in the back.
There's no time

26
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,397
Hurry up!

27
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,900
Ma, my saree is untying

28
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,568
I told you to tie it with a pin

29
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,512
Hold it

30
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,440
Let your father pass

31
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,985
Hold your breath in

32
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,820
Tuck your saree in

33
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,055
Cover your head. We're going to
a temple, not to your college

34
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,659
I can't find the saree end

35
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,867
- What are you doing?
- Why didn't you oil your hair?

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,962
Tell him...

37
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,177
...to sit with confidence

38
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,478
No need to misbehave

39
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,949
You're our only son, our pride

40
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,218
Don't chomp on your food.
Don't spit when you talk

41
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,690
You talk as though I'd
never seen a girl before

42
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,727
You want some water?

43
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,926
How far is the temple?

44
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,824
Someone's getting restless
to see the girl

45
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,340
Let's introduce ourselves

46
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:37,247
The girl's father, Madan Pal

47
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,785
The boy's father,
Chandra Prakash Tiwari

48
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,256
His wife, Subhadra Rani

49
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,920
Boy's mother, Shashi Tiwari

50
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:52,433
Boy's sisters, Jaya and Hema
and their husbands

51
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,961
She's my younger sister.
Prem's aunt, Naintara

52
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,501
I think the boy and girl should
introduce themselves

53
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,802
Absolutely

54
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,010
Sandhya

55
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,308
Sandhya

56
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,950
Prem, introduce yourself

57
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,312
You've done it, Papa

58
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,995
One person missing, Samar.
Sandhya's younger brother

59
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,496
He has exams,
so he isn't here

60
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,071
- ls Sandhya educated?
- A degree in teaching

61
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,131
She's wanted to teach
since childhood

62
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,302
She even taught her dolls maths

63
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,577
Ask him yourself

64
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,180
She asks if Prem is educated

65
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,485
Prem has a degree in Commerce

66
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,217
He's always been keen
on accounting

67
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,194
He's more interested in
bank notes than books

68
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:09,302
Think it over and tell me

69
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,634
I already have

70
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,379
What do you say?

71
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,718
The girl is lovely. Did you
notice her good nature?

72
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,052
She didn't speak.
You talk of her nature

73
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:26,084
Being silent in front of her elders
is a sign of a good nature

74
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:30,188
So you prefer the girls who
waste time in your shop...

75
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,856
...recording songs?

76
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,199
You listen! She's a nice girl.
That's it

77
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,062
A nice girl! And her appearance?

78
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,696
What's wrong?

79
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,104
Is she blind, deaf, mute, crippled?

80
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,840
Saw her size? Huge

81
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,780
You're no movie star,
you high school dropout

82
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,416
It's the food these days

83
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:57,457
Your sister put on pounds
after she got married

84
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,324
Her husband still loves her

85
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,331
They chose each other.
What choice do I have?

86
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,365
To hell with your choice

87
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:09,029
Your choice will turn your parents
into paupers

88
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,700
Papa, talk to him gently,
he'll understand

89
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,296
so, you try

90
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,240
Listen, son

91
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:21,876
If she was attractive, we'd have
to buy her cosmetics

92
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:27,489
She'll earn money. She's going to
be a teacher

93
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:30,582
- It'll help us
- I will not marry her

94
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,486
- That's it
- How dare you!

95
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:40,766
Do it, Prem. For the family's sake

96
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:02,182
I'll look for a lovely special girl

97
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:09,988
Not temporary, someone permanent

98
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:22,033
I'll look for a big earner,
sober and sweet

99
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:26,309
Not temporary, someone permanent

100
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,064
Eyes like a golden fairy

101
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,099
A magic wand in her hand

102
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:50,070
I'll look for the perfect bride

103
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:54,132
He'll have a bike and a car,
good manners too

104
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:58,545
I'll consider him,
that's if he's faithful

105
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,108
She'll go with me to visit Shimla,
Kullu Manali

106
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:08,089
But not forget to buy veggies on
her way home from work

107
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,152
That's the one for me

108
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:19,964
I'll look for a graduate, a lively,
cheeky type

109
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,727
Not a fellow who looks old and grumpy

110
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,698
He's a man who masters
household chores

111
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:31,569
No, no ordinary type, you see

112
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,514
A deluxe model will suit me

113
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:06,908
Are you ok?

114
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,805
My head is about to explode

115
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,824
Take a pill. You'll feel better

116
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,894
You want to die at your
own wedding?

117
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:47,523
I told you - don't drink milk
after Chow mien

118
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:54,524
Papa, it's his allopathic meds.
He's throwing them up

119
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,724
No one stops him

120
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,560
Give him some soda,
he'll be ok

121
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,738
I really like the scent of marigolds

122
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,805
Welcome

123
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,612
See how beautiful the room looks

124
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:21,682
Prem's aunt hand-picked the flowers

125
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,622
- Prem loves them
- She sneezed

126
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,457
You have a cold?

127
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:29,929
I'm allergic to flowers

128
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,059
We'll get rid of them
in the morning

129
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:38,334
The room is decorated
with a lot of love

130
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,467
Remove all the flowers

131
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,715
Where is it?

132
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,617
Don't rush things in bed

133
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:03,320
Let her get ajob first.
Babies can come later

134
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:05,688
On paid maternity leave

135
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,699
You feeling ok?

136
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,221
The bathroom?

137
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,557
Change here

138
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,121
Ok

139
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,262
Wait. I'll go out

140
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,284
You can come in

141
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:07,841
Sandhya

142
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,584
- A call for you
- Coming, Mummyji

143
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,577
Hope I didn't wake you

144
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:46,352
- How did you get this number?
- So, how was last night?

145
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,185
He behaved like a child...

146
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,451
abandoned somewhere

147
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,692
He slept in one corner of the bed,
me on the other

148
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,764
Listen, I'll call you later. Bye

149
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,850
Wake the Prince of Celibacy
out of his slumber

150
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,941
Don't talk so loud

151
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,010
She can hear you

152
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,723
You worry about being overheard.
But not about your son

153
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,694
Don't blame him. She could've
made the first move

154
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,120
She's arrogant

155
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,726
Just because she's educated

156
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:34,629
She didn't even greet me
at the wedding

157
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:37,461
Giggled away with her family

158
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,298
Sure! We aren't in her league

159
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,105
Why blame the poor girl?

160
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,843
Think of how she must feel

161
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:49,816
Our son is work-shy.
He's so arrogant

162
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,717
A boy like him should be
taught a lesson

163
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,748
Good morning, Mr. Groom

164
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,490
- Where to?
- The Youth Club

165
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,119
The Youth Club will ruin you

166
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,798
You want to become a freedom
fighter. Can't kill afly

167
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,434
- We'll talk later
- Wait a minute

168
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,630
Yes, we'll talk later.
Look at me

169
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,529
Look at me. Well?

170
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:18,978
You can hit me if you want.
I'll do as I please

171
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:22,082
One whack will son you.
Where's my shoe?

172
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,581
Don't hit him

173
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:29,954
How sweet! She's made us tea

174
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:36,262
Prem is at the Youth Club. He loves
working out, since childhood

175
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,959
Is your family into fitness?

176
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,870
Only Papa. I do yoga at home

177
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,697
It shows

178
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,870
We salute those great men

179
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:56,714
The great men who have given us
the wisdom of life

180
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:03,881
We bow a hundred times to
those great men

181
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:10,086
Remember the martyr Bhagat Singh

182
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,496
The leader Subhas Chandra Bose

183
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:15,291
Shivaji Maharaj and Vajpayeeji

184
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:19,066
Do you think any of these great men
lacked focus?

185
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:19,867
No

186
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,402
So, let's promise ourselves

187
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,578
To let their lives inspire us

188
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,939
To follow in their footsteps

189
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:29,014
Of course!

190
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,920
- I have news. Prem is married
- Congratulations!

191
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,653
- That calls for a party
- Yes

192
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,255
Papa is against inviting riff-raff

193
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:42,058
I agree with him. I'm against
parties too

194
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,220
So be it!

195
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,958
Study hard, ok?

196
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,498
Give it to Jaya

197
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:54,134
- Take care of our Prem
- Sure

198
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:58,001
Give us a missed call.
Ring once, and you ring twice

199
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,114
Go safely

200
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:04,249
I don't know what's
happening to me

201
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,584
So run away

202
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,448
Who is stopping you?

203
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,055
I couldn't make high school

204
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,456
The computer course was in English.
I'm zero at it

205
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,296
Papa pushed me into marrying

206
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:22,067
And you're saying I must run away?

207
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,268
Mom, it's the first day.
Things take time

208
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:32,111
I woke up late today

209
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,910
The alarm didn't ring

210
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,416
No action and you wake up late

211
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:41,018
If this goes on, your in-laws
will send you home

212
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,616
Mridula can't keep anything
to herself

213
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,360
God has been kind to you.
You married a video tape guy

214
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,662
Ask him to show you an erotic film

215
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,605
It'll give you ideas

216
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:04,733
Rebel

217
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,340
Rebel until you find a way out

218
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:12,845
I can't rebel. But in the bedroom
I can

219
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,683
It's my battlefield

220
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:17,822
If he is a little shy,
make the first move

221
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:20,794
Pleasing your husband is
your responsibility too

222
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,488
Walk slowly, please

223
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,301
I've finished engineering.
Have some sweets

224
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,429
Prem!

225
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,609
Straight and first right. You'll see
Vijay's shop. I have work

226
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,371
Aren't you coming?

227
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,471
Just take one piece - not
the whole box

228
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:44,916
You know Vijay. What will I do
in a ladies' store?

229
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,783
- See you later
- Listen!

230
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,147
Namaste, sister-in-law

231
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,128
- Will you have some tea?
- No, thanks

232
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:00,661
Where's Prem?

233
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,324
He's busy

234
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,735
I need some stuff

235
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,777
- These bangles are lovely
- Not bangles

236
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,104
Something like that

237
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,440
See this

238
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:19,248
No. Next to that

239
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:25,419
- This one?
- The one above

240
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:30,325
Sister, show them to her.
I have work

241
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,226
Can I help?

242
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,935
A nightgown?

243
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:39,269
- Sure. Any undergarments?
- Only the nightgown

244
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:45,270
It will really suit you

245
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:48,681
That's fine

246
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:50,444
And this is the inner...

247
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,516
All right. I'll take it

248
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:11,799
Tell me when you're done
inspecting them

249
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,774
I was looking at their handbags

250
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:16,206
Sure you were

251
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:24,043
Hey Prem, is that your wife?

252
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,379
Yes

253
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,149
- You brought your wife shopping?
- I'm Sandhya

254
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:28,983
That's Pervin

255
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:32,253
Very pretty. Visit me some day

256
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:35,261
I live nearby. Drop by sometime

257
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:37,991
- Hurry!
- Just shut up and wait

258
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:40,864
Tehmina, get my purse

259
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:47,504
- Let me talk
- Why do you want to talk to her?

260
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:53,311
Have some sweets. I've just
finished my engineering degree

261
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:56,243
Easy. I have to give some
to the others

262
00:23:57,605 --> 00:24:01,523
What was the big hurry?
You didn't let me talk

263
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,528
Why are you getting angry?
What have I done?

264
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:13,061
I am talking to you

265
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,334
Take me to the government library

266
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:19,361
Ok, I'll walk home

267
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:10,684
- I'm telling you straight
- This is a library

268
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,432
I don't like talking to people

269
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:26,936
Who asked you to talk?
I was talking

270
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:28,802
What's your problem?

271
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:32,775
I don't like chatting with
all those shopkeepers

272
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,184
I don't like being interrupted either

273
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,245
Does it bother you if
I talk to someone?

274
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,719
You don't know these people

275
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:48,525
When I am alone, they will
get after me

276
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:51,530
Where's the celebration?

277
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,698
My father was right

278
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:57,739
People here like keeping
their money locked up

279
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:32,571
Sandhya wants to see a film. Papa
is setting up the VCR

280
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:36,972
She should've got her own TV.
Why must we miss the soap?

281
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:41,950
Nothing happens in those soaps.
You won't miss anything

282
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:45,316
I'm hanging up. Ask Hema to call

283
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,319
Can I please close the window?

284
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:52,421
Sure. Lock it

285
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,030
Listen

286
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,665
Please close the window

287
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,635
The window

288
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:27,584
Can you set up the VCR?

289
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:07,866
Are you ready?

290
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:22,313
"Ma,-tyrs' DaY"

291
00:28:23,737 --> 00:28:25,411
Aren't you watching?

292
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,280
Not in the mood

293
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,681
Send the TV back

294
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:33,554
- I'll tell Papa...
- Why tell Papa?

295
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,263
We'll watch it together

296
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:45,861
Put the light off

297
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:44,424
Quilt?

298
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:14,686
Wate r?

299
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:45,820
Our child just became a man

300
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,159
Bless us, Lord

301
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,261
Where are you going?

302
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:55,729
I want to share the good news
with my daughters

303
00:30:56,657 --> 00:30:58,262
Tell them tomorrow

304
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:14,317
Did you see the whole film?

305
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:18,125
I don't get tired halfway like you

306
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,159
I saw it till the end

307
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:28,291
Who heats the water at your place?

308
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:30,303
We have a geyser

309
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,901
- Did you have breakfast?
- No

310
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,809
How did your exams go?

311
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:40,380
Maths was tough as usual

312
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,272
Make sure you pass

313
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:46,082
No one in our family has failed.
I want top marks

314
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:51,220
You talk like your family inherited
the world's brains

315
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:56,227
She is Prem's aunt

316
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,489
You leaving?

317
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:00,760
She's going

318
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:03,630
- Let your brother eat
- I've eaten

319
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,634
They don't eat much.
But every grain shows

320
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,803
It's called metabolism

321
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,779
My respects

322
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,216
Where's Prem?

323
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:21,448
What are you doing?
Help her with the luggage

324
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:27,122
Give my regards to your father

325
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:28,687
Travel safe

326
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:45,707
I left a list of songs on the table

327
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,646
- Record them for me
- If I have the time

328
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:50,711
Come on the 4th

329
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:53,849
- Why?
- Why do you think?

330
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:55,786
Let's go, Samar

331
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,062
I couldn't say no to Papa
about marrying

332
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,865
I couldn't stop myself last night

333
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,272
Domestic life is going to
drag me into quicksand

334
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:20,712
What can I teach a person
who has no will power?

335
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:24,308
I feel suffocated. What will
power do you mean?

336
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:28,654
Don't live in denial.
Just accept the reality

337
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:32,053
How can I accept someone
I am not attracted to?

338
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:48,640
How do I look?

339
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:51,268
Do whatever, you will always
look a witch

340
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:53,940
Want a slap?

341
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:02,050
This is my life now

342
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:05,154
A gravitational pull is sucking me

343
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:08,051
Accept defeat then

344
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:11,364
It's not gravity

345
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,000
The pleasure in bed
is pulling you

346
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:17,532
Don't be ashamed of pleasure

347
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:22,240
It is not pleasure.
It's compulsion

348
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:27,007
So enjoy your compulsions.
Why else are you on earth?

349
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:35,957
All objects in this universe
are drawn to one another

350
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:41,222
The law of gravity

351
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:48,265
So why do some objects
not meet...

352
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:50,531
...and stay fixed in their place?

353
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:51,995
Although...

354
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:57,571
...they want to reach out to
one another, they cannot

355
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:14,287
Pl3Y

356
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,329
- From here?
- Press

357
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:19,355
Listen to the sound

358
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:21,298
Son, is this a CD?

359
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:25,499
A CD - a compact disc.
This is the future

360
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,599
Give up the old stuff

361
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:34,075
Listen to the sound

362
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,543
Really good

363
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:43,321
I'll get you a good deal. About 150K.
Plus a CD player

364
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:45,484
How much for this lot?

365
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:48,558
There are no buyers for this

366
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:51,633
Cassettes are only sold as scrap

367
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:54,360
No one cares for them

368
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,670
We'll have to start the business
from scratch

369
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:01,407
Why can't we get a loan?

370
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,108
I haven't repaid the loan I took
for my daughter's wedding

371
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,573
I told you

372
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:11,912
No borrowing money

373
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,817
Suggest something then

374
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:18,021
I suggest you put the radio
under your pillow

375
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:20,451
Listen to Kumar Sanu's love songs

376
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:21,855
We'll manage somehow

377
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:26,791
- When do you get Sandhya?
- On the 4th

378
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,694
That's today

379
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:31,973
She's waiting for him
and he's busy hogging

380
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,772
Give him more food

381
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:43,582
Why don't you call him?

382
00:36:43,638 --> 00:36:45,312
He could call me

383
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:47,351
Are you keeping score?

384
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:49,890
Anyway I'm better than he is

385
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,488
Papa, please eat

386
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:55,261
Samar, come and eat

387
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:59,960
Don't give me too much.
Leave something for Prem

388
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,831
There's no need

389
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:24,321
I'll go check

390
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,597
Prem, welcome

391
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:37,403
We were expecting you

392
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:42,275
- God bless you, son
- Get him some snacks

393
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,540
Hello, brother-in-law

394
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,581
- Give him a plate
- No, thanks

395
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:50,912
- I have an early start
- Eat something

396
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:53,146
No thanks

397
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,485
Shall we go?

398
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,592
Prem, keep this money

399
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:06,724
No, please no

400
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,666
Take it. It's for good luck

401
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:11,266
Keep it. Buy something for me

402
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,372
Hold on to your bag

403
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,636
- What's wrong?
- I'm hungry

404
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,130
But you said you ate

405
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:59,450
Sit here. I'll sit over there

406
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:03,555
Give me some kachori
with onions

407
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:05,252
You eat onions?

408
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,496
- Yes. But my family don't
- My family eats onions

409
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,156
Must you go on about your family?

410
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:16,531
We eat onions. We don't sleep
before 12

411
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:19,163
What can I do if you all lie?

412
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:23,675
At least I know something
about you now

413
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:25,671
You smoke?

414
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,514
And drink. No one drinks
in yourfamily?

415
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:29,343
No

416
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,259
Don't tell anyone

417
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,891
Will your father hit you?

418
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,869
I am not scared of anyone

419
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:52,032
You're the fearless
warrior of the family

420
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:53,401
Eat up

421
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:03,179
- Want some?
- No, thank you

422
00:40:10,678 --> 00:40:14,562
The threads of endearment...

423
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:18,829
...are entangled in your fingers

424
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:33,274
I cannot find a way...

425
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:37,114
...to untie the knot

426
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,147
My life is like that star...

427
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:53,267
...that passes through the clouds

428
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,411
You must be a little crazy

429
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:50,048
To have chosen me

430
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,656
How did you hear...

431
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,027
...my unspoken words?

432
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,634
What's wrong?

433
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,372
I want some water

434
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:11,369
I'll get it

435
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:24,051
The girls today know every1hing

436
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:27,863
What's good or bad for them

437
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:33,503
Good or bad... they also
enjoy their youth more

438
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:36,367
But what does Prem know?

439
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:40,575
Weren't you excited when
you were young? Wasn't I?

440
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:44,438
It's their time to have fun

441
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:47,844
Need something?

442
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:51,952
He was feeling hot

443
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:56,756
You're shameless! Hush

444
00:43:10,558 --> 00:43:11,902
Here

445
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,636
Did you record my songs?

446
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:48,868
What?

447
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,186
The spices are on the top shelf

448
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:09,026
- Sugar and tea down below
- Where's my medicine bottle?

449
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:11,656
I threw it out. The meds had expired

450
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:14,995
You threw it out?
I bought it two months ago

451
00:44:15,088 --> 00:44:18,904
Expired pills are not good
for the health

452
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:23,310
Don't show off your education.
I know what expiry means

453
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:25,310
I was trying to help

454
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:28,045
Why do you keep taunting me?

455
00:44:28,102 --> 00:44:30,847
I asked about my medicine bottle

456
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:34,755
If you must, here it is

457
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:38,289
Answering back, eh?

458
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:39,854
We'll talk later

459
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:43,564
The way you talk. Making
a mountain out of a molehill

460
00:44:43,651 --> 00:44:44,892
You should be grateful

461
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:46,188
Without me...

462
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:48,759
Prem wouldn't have married
a fat girl like you

463
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:51,498
As if Prem was some movie star

464
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:53,233
If you made him marry me...

465
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:56,402
...you should've taught him
how to treat me

466
00:44:57,397 --> 00:44:58,639
Listen to her!

467
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:01,713
I was married too

468
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:05,778
I ran a house, but I never
answered back

469
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:09,455
Don't talk to your elders like that

470
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:13,718
No one cares about me. They only
think of themselves

471
00:45:14,448 --> 00:45:16,556
- What is it?
- Ask your dear aunt

472
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:20,925
Where are you going?

473
00:45:24,324 --> 00:45:26,203
Just ask me to unpack

474
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,468
Why did you marry me?

475
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:35,873
Get my clothes. I'm late

476
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,685
Here. I'm late

477
00:47:34,955 --> 00:47:36,868
Greetings

478
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:39,931
- Raghubir, what brings you here?
- For you

479
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,906
- What is it?
- Sweets

480
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:44,741
And an invite

481
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:46,039
A wedding invite?

482
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,177
Nirmal's wedding?

483
00:47:48,235 --> 00:47:52,153
Congratulations!
Listen, everybody. Prem

484
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:56,488
They met at college? So that's
what they teach nowadays

485
00:47:57,144 --> 00:47:59,387
She's a dentist

486
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:02,930
Prem got left behind because
of English. Otherwise...

487
00:48:03,017 --> 00:48:05,397
Stop it! Call Sandhya

488
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:08,994
She is busy. Why call her?

489
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:13,831
I called out for you

490
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:17,405
But Prem took you away

491
00:48:19,934 --> 00:48:22,348
You must come to my party

492
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,015
Ok

493
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:25,552
Saying okay won't do

494
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,386
Sandhya, he won't listen to me,
so...

495
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:32,552
...grab him by his ears
and bring him there

496
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:35,391
Have your tea. It's getting cold

497
00:48:51,065 --> 00:48:52,603
I told my father-in-law...

498
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:56,881
...to hire a community centre.
We'll have 500 guests or more

499
00:48:56,937 --> 00:49:00,012
A 21-gun salute for my family

500
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:03,149
They agreed. Their gift.
Made in Japan

501
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,192
Amazing sound

502
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,488
What song do you want hear?

503
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:10,532
- Any song
- Which song?

504
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:13,328
I am a cut from the
old matrimonial school

505
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:16,935
Prem is the new generation

506
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:21,102
I fancy matrimony, but my
girl's father doesn't fancy me

507
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:25,342
Our Youth Club leader said
we must avoid domesticity

508
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:28,443
Why think now? You're halfway there

509
00:49:28,903 --> 00:49:31,648
Marrying Deepti is not wrong

510
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:34,221
Show her photograph to Prem

511
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:39,419
That's Deepti. Fresh as a rose

512
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:44,960
Anyway, tell me how's married life?

513
00:49:46,186 --> 00:49:47,291
Can't you tell?

514
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:57,574
- If Sandhya sees you drinking...
- She can go to hell

515
00:49:57,665 --> 00:50:00,911
Prem, you're drunk.
Give me your glass

516
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:02,346
Sir, I respect you...

517
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:05,648
I listen to your advice. Don't
say anything now

518
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:09,183
Leave me alone

519
00:50:10,144 --> 00:50:13,185
My father ruined my life.
I stood no chance

520
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,259
None of you help me one bit

521
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:18,625
Control yourself, Prem

522
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:21,464
Nirmal, my friend.
You got it right

523
00:50:22,156 --> 00:50:26,667
You worked hard. You're
a gentleman. I'm illiterate

524
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:29,474
And your Deepti - she's perfect

525
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:32,472
- She'll make you happy
- I know

526
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:35,883
No one asked if I wanted a life
like this

527
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:41,785
Papa hitched me up. We're like
oxen under a plough

528
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:44,018
Wait, Prem

529
00:50:47,948 --> 00:50:50,898
Sandhya is a good girl.
Looks aren't every1hing

530
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:53,833
Then why show me
Deepti's photograph?

531
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:55,528
Why do you love Suman?

532
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:57,365
You're like my brother

533
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:58,564
Drop in

534
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:02,668
She's so fat. I don't feel
like touching her

535
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:08,139
Sleep with Sandhya one night...

536
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:09,979
...you'll know what hell is

537
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,317
Stop him!

538
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:24,153
I'll kill him

539
00:52:24,945 --> 00:52:27,895
You hit me

540
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:40,372
I hit my sister, thanks to you

541
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:43,739
Stop him

542
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:46,571
Where to?

543
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:50,244
Let's sit down
and sort things out

544
00:52:51,104 --> 00:52:53,553
Papa has hit him enough

545
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:56,216
Prem's father knows what's best
for him

546
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:06,025
- Take my shoe and beat him
- Never mind, Papa

547
00:53:06,486 --> 00:53:09,060
It's not his fault. It's yours

548
00:53:09,156 --> 00:53:14,042
You should've helped him study,
instead of getting him married

549
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:16,469
Don't go

550
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:10,930
What are you doing?

551
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:13,126
Tell me, will you?

552
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,792
You gave my room to Samar

553
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:18,237
No phone. No letter.
How come you're back?

554
00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:21,137
I've left Prem. No more questions

555
00:54:21,228 --> 00:54:23,507
Left him? Are you crazy?

556
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,048
Did he hit you? I'll son him out

557
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:31,075
Look! She tore up my school files

558
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:32,743
How will I get an A+?

559
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:37,219
Don't eye my room! I'll fix you too

560
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,885
Why are you waiting?
Call her in-laws

561
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,964
- Ask her what happened
- Don't dare call them

562
00:54:43,017 --> 00:54:44,862
Over my dead body

563
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:49,929
As if you were sparkling with life.
Why are you here?

564
00:54:50,324 --> 00:54:53,605
He does not need me.
I do not need him

565
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:56,333
He wanted a wife

566
00:54:57,197 --> 00:54:59,110
He has no manners

567
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:02,346
He insulted me in front of
the whole neighborhood

568
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,752
He called me a fat cow,
and other things, mother

569
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,412
But you are a fat cow

570
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:12,917
Men are men. They talk nonsense
when they're angry

571
00:55:13,013 --> 00:55:14,926
Why argue with him?

572
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:18,523
Even if he was rude, you're smart.
You should've kept mum

573
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:22,166
Kept mum?
I gave him atight slap

574
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:25,138
He won't talk to a woman like that
for the rest of his life

575
00:55:25,192 --> 00:55:29,269
This is what too much education
does to a girl

576
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:31,106
No need for your tears, mother

577
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:34,548
Nothing happened. I am intact

578
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:36,240
Have some shame

579
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:39,151
Be modest in front of your father

580
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,310
Explain to her

581
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:43,484
Listen, women have to...

582
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:45,560
That's enough

583
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:48,753
Please listen

584
00:55:59,093 --> 00:56:02,806
The warhorse Chetak galloped,
setting the earth on fire

585
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:07,140
When Chetak rode into the battlefield,
the enemy was destroyed

586
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:10,811
Now it is time for you to run.
Fly with the wind

587
00:56:11,506 --> 00:56:12,645
Enough

588
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:15,447
Time is short and the task is hard

589
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:17,689
We have to win

590
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:18,621
Sure

591
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,991
Being sure will not make you win

592
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,152
Sure

593
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,825
Ok

594
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:27,164
Use your brawn and brains
to win this race

595
00:56:27,254 --> 00:56:28,131
H ow?

596
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:29,902
Hop on, son

597
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,577
That's it

598
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:44,207
This is how you'll win

599
00:56:44,271 --> 00:56:46,219
Son, get off now

600
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:51,916
Stan exercising

601
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:54,149
Why, sir?

602
00:56:55,382 --> 00:56:56,761
Are they avoiding me?

603
00:56:56,851 --> 00:57:02,773
Nothing of the sort. We're busy
preparing for the contest

604
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,403
Am I not invited?

605
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,775
We wanted to invite you but after
what happened

606
00:57:09,196 --> 00:57:10,437
Yes, sure

607
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:14,081
You hypocrite. Lecturing me
and licking Nirmal's boots

608
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:17,844
Mind your language

609
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:21,880
Just because my wife left me,
everyone is ignoring me

610
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:25,587
Calm down. Let's talk

611
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,217
I know you people

612
00:57:27,314 --> 00:57:29,593
They're enjoying my predicament

613
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:32,230
Stop talking nonsense

614
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,959
Let go. I'll slap you

615
00:57:34,888 --> 00:57:35,959
You'll hit me?

616
00:57:36,056 --> 00:57:36,967
Scum

617
00:57:37,057 --> 00:57:40,873
- Showing me your pretty wife's photo
- Don't drag her into this

618
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:42,270
I'll drown you

619
00:57:42,863 --> 00:57:44,811
What's all this?

620
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:45,636
Go

621
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,704
He's upset. I'll talk to him

622
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:49,545
I've had my eye on him

623
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,818
No unruly boys here

624
00:57:52,272 --> 00:57:55,347
- He'll be ok
- Take him away

625
00:57:57,812 --> 00:57:59,258
Throw cold water on him

626
00:57:59,614 --> 00:58:01,219
He's too hot-headed

627
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:07,166
Aunty, you don't worry at all

628
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:08,702
These days the law is with women

629
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:11,568
You should believe in yourself
and the power of women

630
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:14,471
You know there are many amendments
favouring women these days

631
00:58:14,529 --> 00:58:16,373
Sandhya's case is super strong

632
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:20,441
- Will they stay together?
- She's talking about divorce

633
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:23,040
- Then why is she smiling?
- Must she cry?

634
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:26,451
Water

635
00:58:27,274 --> 00:58:28,413
Move!

636
00:58:30,444 --> 00:58:34,625
Did you change your surname
on your passport, or...?

637
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:35,986
No

638
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:37,758
Did you give any dowry?

639
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:40,391
Any TV, VCR, sofa scooter,
anyihing?

640
00:58:40,453 --> 00:58:43,563
- Who is giving us a TV?
- She asks if we gave anything

641
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:45,298
Let me talk

642
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:49,543
We spent about 20,000

643
00:58:49,597 --> 00:58:51,738
Jewelry, clothes, etc

644
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:54,145
Madam, we spent very little cash

645
00:58:54,234 --> 00:58:58,448
- Herjewelry is still with her mother
- In the bank locker

646
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:02,456
What about my humiliation?
Who pays for that?

647
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,583
Sandhya, that's not how you speak to
your parents

648
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:06,854
They also want your good
Say sorry

649
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:10,330
Stop stirring up my daughter.
We educated her

650
00:59:11,418 --> 00:59:12,660
She wants sister to apologise

651
00:59:12,753 --> 00:59:14,928
- To whom?
- To you, for being rude

652
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:17,333
Sandhya, don't lose heart, ok?

653
00:59:17,424 --> 00:59:19,930
Just concentrate on your exams

654
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:23,405
Aunty, don't take tension

655
00:59:23,463 --> 00:59:25,467
Divorce is very cool these days

656
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:28,048
It's the means to a happy life

657
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:30,374
I did not study law

658
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:34,253
But I know we had a happy marriage

659
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:36,087
lam sure

660
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:38,221
Come with me

661
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,955
Are you drunk?

662
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,597
Don't be stupid.
Go, get your wife back

663
00:59:48,689 --> 00:59:50,226
Like hell. I won't

664
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:56,237
I'm won't be a loser anymore. I'll
make something of my life

665
00:59:57,932 --> 01:00:01,941
Good movie lines, that's how
film heroes talk

666
01:00:02,469 --> 01:00:06,285
People like us must live
connected to reality

667
01:00:06,641 --> 01:00:08,451
I'll re-sit my high school exam

668
01:00:08,743 --> 01:00:10,850
I will not live with my gloomy family

669
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,824
Are you nuts? You're a married man

670
01:00:15,516 --> 01:00:19,490
Your wife will soon be a teacher and
you want to carry a school bag?

671
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,291
Look at me

672
01:00:21,756 --> 01:00:26,470
Don't I dream of becoming an actor?
Look at the ham actors today

673
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:30,974
My father forced me to live here.
I'm wasting my life

674
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:38,454
My only hope is that Suman's father
accepts me

675
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:39,541
Then life is set

676
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,744
You love Suman, right?

677
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,217
If her father marries her to someone
else, would you do nothing?

678
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:49,526
There's a big difference between
reality and the movies

679
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,354
Do you know the truth of my life?

680
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:54,959
...36B..

681
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:59,133
"Sister, 36D. The elastic is strong
and long-lasting"

682
01:00:59,226 --> 01:01:02,973
Dog! Siding with my enemies.
I'm better off alone

683
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:09,379
Do as you please

684
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:36,474
- Saraswati Coaching Centre?
- Yes

685
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:39,612
I want to re-sit the high school
exam

686
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:42,047
Show me your certificates

687
01:01:47,975 --> 01:01:50,116
She's made bland food

688
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:52,352
Don't interrupt.
Let me see the recipe

689
01:01:52,913 --> 01:01:55,692
She'll make us sick, dieting

690
01:01:55,783 --> 01:02:00,258
I won't stop you. Eat what you like.
This is for me

691
01:02:01,321 --> 01:02:05,068
This is the last straw.
First she left her husband

692
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:07,540
Now she's dividing the kitchen

693
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:10,669
- What are you cooking?
- Poison. Want some?

694
01:02:11,165 --> 01:02:13,238
No. You go ahead

695
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:40,864
Papa?

696
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:45,574
- A new CD shop is opening
- Whose shop is it?

697
01:03:47,728 --> 01:03:48,707
It's here

698
01:03:49,163 --> 01:03:52,306
- Isn't this Nirmal's shop?
- Let's see

699
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,543
How can one market have two
recording shops?

700
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:58,982
Is this Nirmal's shop?

701
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:00,244
Yes, it is

702
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:02,954
When does it open?

703
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:05,692
The opening ceremony is over

704
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:07,952
We're in trouble

705
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:17,833
What will happen to our business
if you open a music store, Nirmal?

706
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:21,341
You have every1hing

707
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:24,469
A decent wife, too

708
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:29,081
He misbehaved at the Youth Club.
I came because of my father

709
01:04:29,537 --> 01:04:31,712
Be polite, Nirmal

710
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:35,455
Don't act pious, Nirmal. It took you
no time to ruin us

711
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:39,152
Have pity. His wife dumped him

712
01:04:39,313 --> 01:04:41,261
Not surprising

713
01:04:41,315 --> 01:04:45,131
You got him married to that hippo
against his will

714
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:47,932
I'll break your head

715
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:50,067
See how he behaves!

716
01:04:52,593 --> 01:04:56,009
- Think before you talk, sister
- What did I say?

717
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:00,180
The shop is our bread and butter

718
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:05,746
We are not here to do charity either

719
01:05:06,173 --> 01:05:09,487
You must be happy. Bankrupting others

720
01:05:09,844 --> 01:05:13,056
You're just jealous.
Jealous of our success

721
01:05:13,146 --> 01:05:15,686
Success? My foot!

722
01:05:15,883 --> 01:05:18,263
We know your father paid a bribe
to get you into college

723
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:23,370
Who is stopping you from using
your brain cells?

724
01:05:23,457 --> 01:05:27,273
The only thing that's free is whining.
That's all you do

725
01:05:27,327 --> 01:05:29,571
Stop taunting me

726
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:36,049
Have some cake first

727
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:38,278
It's her birthday. Some respect

728
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:43,384
Happy birthday

729
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:45,981
Happy birthday

730
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,961
I'll give you a chance to save
your shop

731
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,254
Take part in the wife-carrying
contest

732
01:05:52,352 --> 01:05:54,995
Win and the shop is yours

733
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:57,332
Nirmal, don't talk rubbish

734
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:58,997
This is too much

735
01:05:59,994 --> 01:06:00,996
I'm serious

736
01:06:01,095 --> 01:06:03,908
You'll never learn.
Go, open your shop!

737
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:06,743
We have 15 years of experience
recording tapes

738
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:11,311
If I was married...

739
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:15,084
- ...I'd take part in the contest
- Naina, keep quiet

740
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:17,551
That's enough from them

741
01:06:17,745 --> 01:06:20,318
Take part in the
wife-carrying contest

742
01:06:20,413 --> 01:06:23,192
I will not. Let my father carry you

743
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,354
You will carry your wife and run

744
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:27,458
It's your birthday, but don't talk rot

745
01:06:27,555 --> 01:06:30,265
I have told him. He'll run

746
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:32,597
- I won't
- Yes, you will

747
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:37,541
Has she gone senile?

748
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:40,475
Haven't we been humiliated enough?

749
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:43,042
What's wrong?

750
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:45,244
Why is she lying down?

751
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:47,321
- She tripped
- How come?

752
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,816
Are you ok?

753
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:50,553
What's wrong?

754
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:54,551
The divorce notice

755
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:56,962
The bet is off

756
01:06:58,652 --> 01:06:59,323
No

757
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:03,864
Yes, we get it

758
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:11,542
Hurry! Thejudge is leaving

759
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,549
Hope I don't leave this world
before him

760
01:07:15,069 --> 01:07:15,946
What is it?

761
01:07:17,004 --> 01:07:18,416
I'll sit in front

762
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:25,315
- What shall I do?
- Take my hand

763
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,289
Push me

764
01:07:30,951 --> 01:07:33,490
Going to bring the girl back?

765
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:37,504
You must wish us bad luck,
right?

766
01:07:39,326 --> 01:07:41,308
Drive carefully

767
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:49,579
Sinister man. He curses everyone

768
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:53,253
Your sister's husband went to
the mountains looking for God

769
01:07:53,473 --> 01:07:55,888
Pervin's husband is in jail

770
01:07:56,276 --> 01:07:58,885
The bra seller can't convince his girl

771
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,786
And Prem has a divorce notice

772
01:08:02,116 --> 01:08:05,293
Chant in the name of your mother,
not God

773
01:08:05,786 --> 01:08:08,064
She keeps talking nonsense

774
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:13,300
What did I say wrong?

775
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:19,937
There'll be lots of crying

776
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,843
Stay calm

777
01:08:20,935 --> 01:08:23,612
So cry once and for all

778
01:08:23,671 --> 01:08:24,980
I'm very proud of you, Sandhya

779
01:08:25,072 --> 01:08:27,988
ls everyone here getting divorced?

780
01:08:28,075 --> 01:08:31,321
- Is that right, Prem?
- It's a divorce court

781
01:08:32,547 --> 01:08:33,788
Stop talking

782
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:37,726
Is there anything I should know?

783
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:42,033
- What's that?

784
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,841
No need to beg Sandhya.
Papa will carry you and run

785
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:48,842
No way

786
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:56,411
Why is God punishing us?

787
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,587
A disaster

788
01:09:00,841 --> 01:09:04,053
Don't cry. We're the guilty ones

789
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:09,058
Who wants a "divorced" sign
outside their house?

790
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:10,896
Look what happened to me

791
01:09:17,391 --> 01:09:20,466
Sandhya Varma, Prem Prakash
Tiwari. Divorce Petition

792
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:25,948
Tiwari is accused of insulting
Sandhya Varma in public

793
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:28,203
Hurting her physically
and emotionally

794
01:09:28,402 --> 01:09:31,181
She asks the court to grant
her divorce

795
01:09:31,506 --> 01:09:35,959
The Tiwaris must pay a divorce
settlement of 50,000 rupees

796
01:09:37,144 --> 01:09:40,857
But she filed for divorce.
Is it mutual consent?

797
01:09:41,448 --> 01:09:42,189
Yes

798
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:44,959
Was it a love marriage?

799
01:09:45,218 --> 01:09:48,669
Just a marriage, no love

800
01:09:49,056 --> 01:09:50,765
Then why did you marry him?

801
01:09:52,593 --> 01:09:53,595
I liked him

802
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:55,107
And you?

803
01:09:56,831 --> 01:09:59,838
Financial pressure. Sandhya
would teach and earn

804
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,977
Papa wanted a bride
who earned a salary

805
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:05,614
So I agreed

806
01:10:06,307 --> 01:10:09,758
Anyihing happened -
kisses, intercourse, etc?

807
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:14,229
- I won't discuss private matters
- He loves humiliating me in public

808
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:18,230
- Hitting me made you proud?
- I am ashamed of that

809
01:10:18,686 --> 01:10:23,538
- You humiliated me
- As though you didn't do the same

810
01:10:23,724 --> 01:10:26,901
And what's this ridiculous
settlement demand?

811
01:10:26,994 --> 01:10:29,568
- Don't you know our situation?
- What about me?

812
01:10:29,764 --> 01:10:31,939
Did you think before slapping me?

813
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:35,007
Quiet, please!

814
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,681
Do the family members
want to say anyihing?

815
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:40,477
Your Honour, what can I say?

816
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:44,219
You're wise. Misunderstandings
are commonplace

817
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:47,394
That doesn't mean separating.
Just come home

818
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:50,894
Prem's father and I fought too

819
01:10:51,118 --> 01:10:53,965
Once I added extra salt
in his mother's food

820
01:10:54,155 --> 01:10:57,139
He hit me hard with his shoe.
But I didn't leave home

821
01:10:57,324 --> 01:11:00,741
Am I talking Greek? I'm asking her
to come back

822
01:11:00,895 --> 01:11:04,847
Do only men have the right to talk?
Must we just cook and clean?

823
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:08,076
This is your chance. File a case
of domestic violence

824
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:14,524
Discuss your emotional
matters outside the court

825
01:11:16,644 --> 01:11:22,065
As per the Marriage Act, the court
asks you to live together for 6 months

826
01:11:22,349 --> 01:11:25,562
If matters are not resolved by then...

827
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:28,869
...the court will approve the
divorce papers

828
01:11:35,696 --> 01:11:39,146
Sandhya, come back.
We're pleading with you

829
01:11:39,233 --> 01:11:41,146
I'll get my room back

830
01:11:41,335 --> 01:11:43,408
Forget the law. Just come back

831
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:46,315
- Ask him to say sorry
- Prem, come here

832
01:11:46,607 --> 01:11:48,646
The one who slapped first,
apologises first

833
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:51,885
Who insulted me in public?
Apologisel

834
01:11:52,013 --> 01:11:52,958
All right

835
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:54,621
sorfY

836
01:11:58,118 --> 01:12:02,229
She's your new mother.
You'll look after her now

837
01:12:02,657 --> 01:12:04,035
Hold this

838
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:06,034
Please come

839
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:09,772
I'm already feeling better

840
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:14,643
The time has come to carry
your personal load

841
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:18,311
Right here in the heart of Rishikesh

842
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:22,419
All husbands! Flex your muscles

843
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:25,718
All wives, lose some weight

844
01:12:32,953 --> 01:12:37,201
The winner gets 10,000 rupees

845
01:12:44,566 --> 01:12:49,919
"Heave-ho, carry that load"
The wife carrying contest

846
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,614
Can I say something?

847
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:26,549
It's not "of" Monday.
It's "on" Monday

848
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:29,719
And we say "in" August.
Not "on" August

849
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:32,256
The preposition is used differently

850
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,085
Why did you touch my book?

851
01:13:34,682 --> 01:13:35,821
Iwasjust...

852
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:39,163
But why? Don't show off
your education

853
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:43,235
Ok. I know you're very smart.
I know nothing

854
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,866
I'm a fool and uneducated

855
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:49,007
But stop putting me down

856
01:13:49,363 --> 01:13:51,710
Listen, bear with me

857
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:54,739
Better we accept the farce
happfly

858
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,173
I'll go in six months

859
01:13:56,336 --> 01:13:57,783
"In" and not "on"

860
01:14:11,752 --> 01:14:13,961
Leave this in room 12

861
01:14:14,354 --> 01:14:17,896
I am a student...
Roll Number 317

862
01:14:23,497 --> 01:14:25,537
- Take a seat
- Thank you

863
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,949
Dear Teacher...

864
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:13,652
I am 25 years old

865
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:18,960
This is my third attempt at
the English exam

866
01:15:19,987 --> 01:15:23,233
My father was right. I'm a loser

867
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:27,800
My struggle to make something
of my life ends here

868
01:15:28,929 --> 01:15:31,207
If you feel any pity...

869
01:15:31,533 --> 01:15:35,542
...or this letter moves you,
or your eyes moisten...

870
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:38,920
...or if you're unmoved and want
to throw away my letter

871
01:15:39,173 --> 01:15:40,711
Or give me a zero

872
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:45,152
Remember you are zeroing
the fate of a family

873
01:16:07,768 --> 01:16:09,248
Today I accept...

874
01:16:09,737 --> 01:16:13,119
...that I have failed my family,
my wife...

875
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:15,351
...and myself

876
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,923
Prem Prakash

877
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,501
Stan serving

878
01:16:35,295 --> 01:16:38,040
Give Prem some of this tasty
steamed food

879
01:16:41,936 --> 01:16:46,788
Why the long face? Sandhya has
made a delicious meal

880
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:48,654
We'll eat together

881
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:52,921
- I am not hungry
- We've been waiting for you

882
01:16:53,314 --> 01:16:55,763
Papa closed the shop early today

883
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:58,388
Have you already eaten?

884
01:16:59,587 --> 01:17:00,658
You're drunk?

885
01:17:00,888 --> 01:17:03,701
Freshen up. He is coming

886
01:17:05,727 --> 01:17:09,941
I must say boiled vegetables
taste delicious

887
01:17:10,665 --> 01:17:12,874
Spices cause acidity

888
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:16,010
Sandhya has made great food

889
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,675
Lentil broth

890
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:22,722
- It's really tasty
- I forgot to add carom seeds

891
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:25,486
It'll taste even better tomorrow

892
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,926
- It's fine
- Have more then

893
01:17:31,418 --> 01:17:35,461
Let Sandhya have the cottage cheese

894
01:17:35,556 --> 01:17:39,063
No, Papa. Let him have it

895
01:17:39,126 --> 01:17:40,265
Eat up

896
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:48,415
I was thinking - Prem and
Sandhya should partake...

897
01:17:49,436 --> 01:17:52,045
...in the wife-carrying championship

898
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:53,749
Great idea

899
01:17:54,274 --> 01:17:55,413
No, Papa

900
01:17:55,677 --> 01:17:58,421
It's embarrassing. It's too strange

901
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:00,282
What's strange about it?

902
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:03,027
Prem's father carried me
and ran four times

903
01:18:04,819 --> 01:18:07,199
That's another thing we didn't win

904
01:18:08,322 --> 01:18:13,140
Prem is very keen to participate
in the contest. Right?

905
01:18:14,295 --> 01:18:17,974
Sure. Why do you think that
I brought her back?

906
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:22,576
He's always had a sense
of humour

907
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:26,708
See that?

908
01:18:43,858 --> 01:18:47,571
Couldn't you have played along
and had your meal?

909
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,841
I can't pretend

910
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:55,347
You all know the tricks

911
01:18:56,637 --> 01:18:58,516
You must know me by now

912
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:01,545
I know nothing of the world

913
01:19:01,976 --> 01:19:04,424
You must think I am blighted

914
01:19:05,379 --> 01:19:07,692
- Come here
- What are you doing?

915
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:14,196
My family's affections are a sham.
Lies!

916
01:19:14,255 --> 01:19:16,498
They are eating what they prefer

917
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:19,497
We were hungry

918
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,942
It's my fault. I tricked her
into coming back

919
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:26,014
She'd run the race, save our shop,
get ajob too

920
01:19:26,066 --> 01:19:27,307
It's all my fault

921
01:19:27,467 --> 01:19:29,415
Let me end my life

922
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:33,188
- What are you doing?
- I'll kill myself

923
01:19:37,144 --> 01:19:41,825
You've been sweet-talking Sandhya,
she doesn't care about us

924
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:43,659
Where are the matches?

925
01:19:45,085 --> 01:19:48,798
Sandhya, diet or exercise...
makes no difference

926
01:19:49,957 --> 01:19:52,337
Someone will love you
as you are

927
01:19:52,426 --> 01:19:53,771
It's all a sham

928
01:19:54,629 --> 01:19:59,139
The whole neighborhood
can watch me burn

929
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:01,648
Where are the matches?

930
01:20:03,103 --> 01:20:05,449
Prem Prakash Tiwari -
Roll No. 317

931
01:20:11,513 --> 01:20:12,515
What happened?

932
01:20:12,747 --> 01:20:15,856
Well, he wrote his English exam
in Hindi

933
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:20,494
He had planned to commit suicide

934
01:20:22,256 --> 01:20:25,673
This is all family matters. It's ok

935
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:30,875
Suicide? He couldn't even kill
a mosquito

936
01:22:11,165 --> 01:22:14,115
Did you really want to kill yourself?

937
01:22:16,804 --> 01:22:18,911
Did you really love me?

938
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,313
You never gave me the chance

939
01:22:23,077 --> 01:22:26,391
To express myself or to feel

940
01:22:29,617 --> 01:22:31,997
I am unworthy of being loved

941
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,992
You know...

942
01:22:38,926 --> 01:22:41,238
I was very keen on marriage

943
01:22:41,829 --> 01:22:45,645
But no one told me what
marriage really is

944
01:22:46,701 --> 01:22:50,710
As if anyone told me. I was misled too

945
01:22:52,873 --> 01:22:54,946
Be smarter the next time

946
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:08,030
Will you invite me to your wedding
if you found someone?

947
01:23:08,455 --> 01:23:10,266
Who will marry me?

948
01:23:12,026 --> 01:23:13,871
I'll find you someone...

949
01:23:14,529 --> 01:23:18,344
...who loves and respects you,
cares for you

950
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:22,080
That's what I thought you'd do

951
01:23:29,309 --> 01:23:30,152
sorfY

952
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,695
It's all right

953
01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:49,112
I'll find you someone you are not
ashamed of

954
01:23:49,964 --> 01:23:52,446
Who doesn't brag about her education

955
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:55,309
Where's a girl like that?

956
01:23:56,003 --> 01:23:58,612
As if there were dozens of suitors
for me

957
01:24:22,897 --> 01:24:25,506
Papa, let's sell the shop

958
01:24:26,967 --> 01:24:30,247
Your call. You wanted a music shop

959
01:24:31,773 --> 01:24:33,276
I'm off, aunt

960
01:24:37,111 --> 01:24:39,457
- Bless you
- Wait

961
01:24:41,115 --> 01:24:42,220
I'm coming

962
01:24:52,192 --> 01:24:53,263
See that?

963
01:24:54,494 --> 01:24:58,709
They wanted you back
for their selfish reasons

964
01:25:00,467 --> 01:25:02,507
A team spirit is needed

965
01:25:03,938 --> 01:25:07,583
True. We aren't a team
nor are we as one

966
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:09,582
Never mind

967
01:25:17,384 --> 01:25:18,261
Listen

968
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:20,398
Best of luck

969
01:25:34,935 --> 01:25:35,971
Go straight

970
01:25:37,705 --> 01:25:38,878
Namaste

971
01:25:43,745 --> 01:25:45,020
Sandhya Varma?

972
01:25:45,646 --> 01:25:47,889
Documents, please

973
01:25:50,885 --> 01:25:54,267
My file? I had it with me

974
01:25:54,488 --> 01:25:58,099
You came for an interview
and forgot your papers?

975
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:00,869
I can't understand. I had the file

976
01:26:02,697 --> 01:26:05,179
Can I come back tomorrow?

977
01:26:05,232 --> 01:26:08,706
The interview is for today,
not tomorrow

978
01:26:10,872 --> 01:26:12,216
Namaste

979
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:14,755
You forgot your file

980
01:26:16,844 --> 01:26:17,846
Your file

981
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:20,955
Who is he?

982
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:23,529
My husband

983
01:26:23,951 --> 01:26:25,488
Your husband?

984
01:26:27,221 --> 01:26:28,030
MY Papers

985
01:26:34,094 --> 01:26:35,507
Quite impressive

986
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:37,868
Have you gone through them?

987
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:41,013
We have no vacancy here

988
01:26:41,435 --> 01:26:43,280
But there's ajob in Meerut

989
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:47,487
If your family allows you,
you could work there

990
01:26:50,645 --> 01:26:53,287
I'll persuade them. Don't worry

991
01:26:53,648 --> 01:26:55,823
- Is it possible?
- Yes

992
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:03,992
12 feet

993
01:27:05,926 --> 01:27:07,601
Business is bad

994
01:27:09,797 --> 01:27:12,804
I've been saying that for a while

995
01:27:13,267 --> 01:27:15,841
I know. Put the shop on sale
at once

996
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:18,478
Inform us soon

997
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:30,991
"Wife-carrying contest"

998
01:28:19,499 --> 01:28:21,344
I've made your song tape

999
01:28:22,703 --> 01:28:25,049
I've left the tape here

1000
01:28:34,248 --> 01:28:35,057
Welcome

1001
01:28:37,952 --> 01:28:39,956
Did you hear about the interview?

1002
01:28:41,188 --> 01:28:41,963
No

1003
01:28:43,357 --> 01:28:45,305
I'm sure you'll get the job

1004
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,463
How do you know?

1005
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:50,966
Ijust know

1006
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:57,575
May I say something?

1007
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:01,183
You can leave whenever
you feel like

1008
01:29:01,576 --> 01:29:03,022
No one will stop you

1009
01:29:04,812 --> 01:29:06,885
My family is jinxed

1010
01:29:08,382 --> 01:29:11,491
There is no point suffering
on our account

1011
01:29:17,157 --> 01:29:18,638
Think about your future

1012
01:29:20,562 --> 01:29:21,598
Ok?

1013
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:31,079
It'll turn out fine

1014
01:29:40,648 --> 01:29:42,094
I have the job

1015
01:29:44,318 --> 01:29:45,161
In Meerut

1016
01:30:07,642 --> 01:30:09,247
So you've decided?

1017
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:15,863
There's no one here to stay for

1018
01:30:19,053 --> 01:30:22,196
There are very few buses
to Meerut from here

1019
01:30:23,558 --> 01:30:28,170
If someone wants to see me,
they'll find a way

1020
01:30:31,465 --> 01:30:32,810
Have you lived alone?

1021
01:30:34,001 --> 01:30:34,742
No

1022
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:38,809
Never had a broken marriage
either

1023
01:30:52,019 --> 01:30:55,299
I am Siddhesh, your husband's
brother

1024
01:30:59,259 --> 01:31:03,143
Yes? How come you thought
of me after so many years?

1025
01:31:05,366 --> 01:31:09,615
Sister-in-law? Sorry, I didn't
recognise your voice. Bad news

1026
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:12,282
Your husband has died

1027
01:31:13,574 --> 01:31:17,617
He went to the Himalayas on
a pilgrimage. He died in a landslide

1028
01:31:17,979 --> 01:31:20,588
He died the day he left me,
15 years ago

1029
01:31:21,081 --> 01:31:23,758
Can you come for his last rites?

1030
01:31:23,951 --> 01:31:27,128
What connection do I have
with your family anymore?

1031
01:31:27,421 --> 01:31:30,963
Did he ever call or write to ask
if I was dead or alive

1032
01:31:31,425 --> 01:31:34,375
I thought I should at least inform you

1033
01:31:35,262 --> 01:31:36,766
Who was it?

1034
01:31:38,432 --> 01:31:39,708
Siddhesh

1035
01:31:41,268 --> 01:31:42,613
What did he say?

1036
01:31:48,743 --> 01:31:50,918
I am a widow

1037
01:31:52,379 --> 01:31:55,090
I've been a widow for years anyway

1038
01:31:57,652 --> 01:31:58,654
Meaning?

1039
01:32:00,722 --> 01:32:02,066
Greetings, uncle

1040
01:32:06,293 --> 01:32:07,364
Where's Prem?

1041
01:32:08,796 --> 01:32:10,573
Are you ready for the race?

1042
01:32:11,065 --> 01:32:14,140
As long as you race when you
carry my funeral pyre

1043
01:32:14,935 --> 01:32:16,381
What's wrong?

1044
01:32:20,575 --> 01:32:22,682
That's enough

1045
01:32:24,078 --> 01:32:24,853
Come

1046
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:31,489
Can I come in?

1047
01:32:32,086 --> 01:32:33,692
The door's unlocked

1048
01:32:44,765 --> 01:32:47,043
Vijay came to take you for the race

1049
01:32:47,468 --> 01:32:49,006
Your Papa told him to go

1050
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:58,486
Look, I never got a chance...

1051
01:33:00,214 --> 01:33:02,093
...to be a wife

1052
01:33:02,183 --> 01:33:05,600
To have a family.
I've just lived as a widow

1053
01:33:11,692 --> 01:33:15,838
This is your time. You both
should make the most of it

1054
01:33:17,565 --> 01:33:19,945
No one is running in that race

1055
01:33:20,701 --> 01:33:22,477
What's the use?

1056
01:33:22,803 --> 01:33:26,949
Thinking of what's useful has done
nothing for us

1057
01:33:27,742 --> 01:33:32,161
Doesn't matter if you win or lose.
Do it for yourselves

1058
01:33:32,446 --> 01:33:35,020
Forcing never achieved anything

1059
01:33:35,783 --> 01:33:37,560
He doesn't want to

1060
01:33:37,619 --> 01:33:39,463
As if you do

1061
01:33:40,254 --> 01:33:43,397
Why ask if you don't want to race?

1062
01:33:44,425 --> 01:33:46,908
Haven't we lost enough face
in the town?

1063
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:49,603
We've lost every1hing

1064
01:33:50,898 --> 01:33:52,709
Nothing left to mock

1065
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:54,842
If there's nothing to lose...

1066
01:33:54,902 --> 01:33:57,009
...then why not run for yourselves?

1067
01:34:00,508 --> 01:34:02,147
Can't you carry me?

1068
01:34:05,513 --> 01:34:06,857
Of course I can

1069
01:34:07,982 --> 01:34:10,522
I didn't go to the Youth Club
for nothing

1070
01:34:15,556 --> 01:34:18,004
Shall I ask your mother
to phone your sisters?

1071
01:34:20,127 --> 01:34:21,300
Why not?

1072
01:34:42,382 --> 01:34:46,893
"Heave-ho, carry that load!"

1073
01:35:27,027 --> 01:35:28,336
I'll be back

1074
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,576
You're here!

1075
01:35:37,672 --> 01:35:39,016
I've signed you on

1076
01:35:43,477 --> 01:35:45,983
Our honour is in your hands

1077
01:35:47,649 --> 01:35:48,754
God bless

1078
01:35:51,852 --> 01:35:53,891
Make sure you win

1079
01:35:54,589 --> 01:35:57,835
Don't pressure us. It's enough
that we're running

1080
01:35:58,058 --> 01:36:00,062
Why are you negative?

1081
01:36:14,341 --> 01:36:15,446
Look who is here

1082
01:36:17,945 --> 01:36:21,692
Can you carry her, Prem? Or do you
need your Papa's help?

1083
01:36:22,316 --> 01:36:23,159
Well, sir?

1084
01:36:26,921 --> 01:36:29,494
- What are you doing here?
- To hell with...

1085
01:36:29,991 --> 01:36:31,836
...my father and her father too

1086
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:34,234
We got married this morning

1087
01:36:34,795 --> 01:36:35,570
Well done!

1088
01:36:39,299 --> 01:36:40,780
Brothers and sisters

1089
01:36:41,135 --> 01:36:44,985
The time has come to shoulder the
responsibilities of marriage

1090
01:36:45,306 --> 01:36:48,848
Let's see who makes it to the end

1091
01:36:49,043 --> 01:36:51,788
You'll face many obstacles

1092
01:36:57,519 --> 01:37:00,092
Who will win 10,000 rupees?

1093
01:37:00,187 --> 01:37:04,298
To inaugurate this race
we have with us the voice...

1094
01:37:06,794 --> 01:37:09,937
...that has captured
the heart of millions

1095
01:37:45,299 --> 01:37:52,623
I request Kumar Sanu to ring
the bell and start the race

1096
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:55,212
One...

1097
01:38:20,802 --> 01:38:23,809
Run, Prem Prakash Tiwari!

1098
01:38:41,121 --> 01:38:45,096
Open your eyes, tie your shoelaces

1099
01:38:45,159 --> 01:38:49,111
Fire your breath like a bullet

1100
01:38:59,139 --> 01:39:01,052
Be careful

1101
01:39:01,842 --> 01:39:04,222
Both feet in one tyre, then the next

1102
01:39:04,444 --> 01:39:05,618
It's not easy

1103
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,226
If you were in my place you'd know

1104
01:39:08,816 --> 01:39:10,057
Hold tight

1105
01:39:20,628 --> 01:39:23,110
I knew the Youth Club leader
was a fraud

1106
01:39:23,164 --> 01:39:25,738
The flying horse was no help

1107
01:39:30,104 --> 01:39:32,644
Prem Tiwari and Sandhya Varma...

1108
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:35,622
...are advancing slowly

1109
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:41,619
You look good together

1110
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:44,463
- You too
- Can you talk later?

1111
01:39:45,052 --> 01:39:46,361
You never learn

1112
01:39:53,094 --> 01:39:57,274
Run like a true man,
kick up a dust storm

1113
01:39:57,965 --> 01:39:59,377
Will you make it?

1114
01:40:01,368 --> 01:40:02,974
Aren't I doing ok?

1115
01:40:03,638 --> 01:40:06,850
- Don't let go
- I won't. Look ahead

1116
01:40:13,114 --> 01:40:17,123
Scale all walls, cross all rivers

1117
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:25,632
- What's wrong?
- It tickles

1118
01:40:26,093 --> 01:40:27,506
Ok?

1119
01:40:53,655 --> 01:40:54,760
Are you ok?

1120
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:57,894
Deepti

1121
01:40:58,893 --> 01:41:01,000
- Here
- I'm hurt

1122
01:41:01,095 --> 01:41:02,439
You crazy?

1123
01:41:03,263 --> 01:41:06,247
- Hurry
- What the hell?

1124
01:41:10,471 --> 01:41:11,543
What happened?

1125
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,887
- What's so funny?
- Just look at you face

1126
01:41:17,044 --> 01:41:18,957
As if you looked lovely

1127
01:41:25,085 --> 01:41:29,060
If people are jealous, so what?
No need of modesty

1128
01:41:29,156 --> 01:41:33,199
If anyone tries to sneak away,
show him up

1129
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:37,371
The thing that knows no end,
soak forever in that madness

1130
01:41:58,953 --> 01:42:03,064
The ground trembles
wherever your foot treads

1131
01:42:29,149 --> 01:42:32,965
I don't want to leave.
Keep me with you

1132
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:23,346
There! The winners
of this year's contest...

1133
01:43:23,437 --> 01:43:26,319
...Prem and Sandhya

1134
01:43:28,108 --> 01:43:30,112
Looks like they're not done yet

1135
01:43:50,364 --> 01:43:54,715
My heart was never as carefree
as now

1136
01:44:06,614 --> 01:44:08,424
Like a letter...

1137
01:44:08,482 --> 01:44:12,799
...that found a new address

1138
01:44:21,596 --> 01:44:24,078
We walk on empty roads

1139
01:44:24,666 --> 01:44:27,912
With our eyes closed

1140
01:44:27,968 --> 01:44:32,387
Ending up in a faraway place.
Aimlessly

1141
01:44:36,076 --> 01:44:39,857
The threads of endearment...

1142
01:44:39,947 --> 01:44:43,660
...are entangled in your fingers

1143
01:44:43,718 --> 01:44:47,864
I cannot find a way...

1144
01:44:47,955 --> 01:44:52,032
...to untie the knot

1145
01:45:27,494 --> 01:45:30,341
I don't care about my tears

1146
01:45:31,599 --> 01:45:34,742
But there is someone whose
tears I cannot see

1147
01:45:36,303 --> 01:45:37,408
Sandhya

1148
01:45:40,808 --> 01:45:44,760
Now you will see a song
composed by Anu Malik

1149
01:45:45,379 --> 01:45:46,917
Lyrics by Varun Grover

1150
01:45:46,981 --> 01:45:50,056
Sung by Sadhana Sargam and
Kumar Sanu
