1
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,930
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,100
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,530
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,230
Will they die?

5
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,060
Unfortunately it has to be that way.

6
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,360
They will all die, except Gundogdu.

7
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,860
Maybe a lucky Alp will live to bring
the bad news to Suleyman Shah.

8
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,130
I don’t believe it.
The reign of Suleyman Shah will be over.

9
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,060
What a big bad world. Incredible.

10
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,460
What if he insists on customs...

11
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,900
...and not hand over the prisoners?

12
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,360
What else can he do?
Will he accept the death of his own son?

13
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
What will we do if he rounds up
his Alps and attacks Kara Toygar?

14
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,060
I know Suleyman Shah very well,
he would put his own life at stake.

15
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,530
Kara Toygar will kill both of them.

16
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
Then only Ertugrul will be left.

17
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,300
-And his death...
-You have gone too far, my Bey. Too far.

18
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,830
No good would come out of this.

19
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,230
You dog! If you were so scared,
why did you team up with me?

20
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,030
For the good of the tribe, my Bey.

21
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,500
-I didn’t expect it to be...
-What didn’t you expect? What?

22
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,830
If a few Alps need to be sacrificed
for the good of the tribe, let them be.

23
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,200
Isn’t it so? Tell me, isn’t it so?

24
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,030
You are right, my Bey.
They can be sacrificed.

25
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,460
May God rest their souls.

26
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,300
We did what needed to be done.

27
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,930
If I hadn’t persuaded Kara Toygar
for the caravan raid...

28
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,540
...he would have stepped on us with his army.

29
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,200
He would rot our dynasty.

30
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Now, all we need to do is to sit back and wait
till the tribe gets the bad news.

31
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,560
You go and wash your face,
you need to freshen up.

32
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,230
Watch out for this coward, Alpargu.

33
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,300
If his fear triggers his tongue...

34
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,560
...feel free to cut it from its root.

35
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,130
Everything will be alright, you will see.

36
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,230
Suleyman Shah would not sacrifice his son.

37
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,260
He would not sacrifice him, right?
Of course not.

38
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,300
But he would not step back
from our customs either.

39
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,600
Sister...

40
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,500
...please do not over think
the situation and devastate yourself.

41
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,100
What if he acts foolishly to rescue Gundogdu
from Kara Toygar’s hands?

42
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,300
This is what I am worried about.

43
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,300
I will go and talk with Suleyman Shah.

44
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,600
First he will free Gundogdu.

45
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
Then I will make him hit the roads
to get Kara Toygar wherever we want.

46
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,600
Once we are there, the rest is up
to your courage and skill, son.

47
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,230
-An important matter is being discussed, Selcan Hatun.
-Get out of my way.

48
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,960
-Our Bey’s orders.
-I told you to get out of my way.

49
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,260
We will ambush Kara Toygar
on the Falcon Hill.

50
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,860
Let us talk outside.

51
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,330
I promise that I will deliver my brother
Gundogdu to you safe and sound.

52
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,560
If anything happens to my Gundogdu...

53
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,400
...if you sacrifice your brother to the ones
you found on the roads...

54
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,230
...you shall never find
peace from me, Ertugrul.

55
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,900
My Bey...

56
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,000
...as a father...

57
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,030
...I will request one last thing from you.

58
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,060
If you give permission,
I want to entrust my daughter to you.

59
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,930
Kara Toygar is after me and my son.
They have no business with my daughter.

60
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,030
My daughter is the tribe’s girl
from now on.

61
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,900
She has no one to turn to
or anywhere to go.

62
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,530
Please be rest assured, aunt.

63
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,000
Stop! What do you want?

64
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,060
I wanted to ask about a sergeant.

65
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,330
He used to be a sergeant in my legion.

66
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,530
-What is his name?
-Sari, they call him Sari Boru too.

67
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,830
Of course we know Sari Boru.

68
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,960
He is not a sergeant but a captain now.

69
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,900
Is he in the base?

70
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,860
He went on a mission with Kara Toygar.
If you have a message, tell it to us.

71
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,560
I do, warrior, I do.

72
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,460
Welcome, Titus.

73
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,100
Have a seat.

74
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,800
I read the letter Ustad-i Azam
sent with a pigeon.

75
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,500
He does not want Kayis
to migrate to Aleppo.

76
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,900
Yes.

77
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,260
He should not worry.

78
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,030
Kayis will not migrate to Aleppo...

79
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,960
...but to a place
I find suitable for them.

80
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,600
How?

81
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,060
Their future Bey thinks just like me.

82
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,100
He prefers to kneel in front of
the Mongols rather than...

83
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,500
...to be neighbors with the Crusaders.

84
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
Who is this man?

85
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,160
Kurdoglu.

86
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,330
Suleyman Shah’s blood brother.

87
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,530
An ambitious fool.

88
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,900
Someone who will do anything we say,
someone we can use as we wish.

89
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,060
What about Suleyman Shah?

90
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,060
Suleyman Shah...

91
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,430
...will come to my fort in the evening...

92
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,800
...and surrender.

93
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,160
Moreover, he will bring with him
the Shahzadas...

94
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,500
...your knights let escape.

95
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,460
Afsin Bey!

96
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,330
I thought you were dead.

97
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,860
It had to be known like that, Boru.

98
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,100
Our state is under great threat.

99
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,330
I need your help.

100
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,330
Why is this ominous news late?

101
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,230
My Bey, Suleyman Shah calls you to his tent.

102
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,400
Whatever happens,
Kara Toygar should not get the Shahzadas.

103
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,930
What if he succeeds in taking
the Shahzadas to Sultan Aladdin?

104
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,260
He would be Aladdin’s favorite commander.

105
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,100
Templars would have Konya in their hands.

106
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,500
They would roam within the palace.
The consequences would be deadly, Sari.

107
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,600
This state was founded
with great difficulty.

108
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,830
We will not refrain from killing
the Shahzadas if needed.

109
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,930
I am ready to do anything
you want from me, my Bey.

110
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,360
Thank you, I know that, Sari, I know.

111
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,100
What a tyrant this Kara Toygar is!

112
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,030
How could he dare to kill our warriors?
As if that is not enough...

113
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,930
...he captured Gundogdu as a prisoner?
-Yes.

114
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,930
Now, they expect me to deliver our guests.

115
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,830
That means that the death of
this rabid dog will be from us.

116
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,560
Let us go with our Alps and
make the sky fall on them.

117
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,330
No!

118
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,960
I will go alone.

119
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,430
I won’t let you go alone.

120
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,530
Did we become blood brothers for one to
stay behind and cry like women...

121
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,030
...while the other one
is going for a certain death, my Bey?

122
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,430
The end of this travel is unknown, Kurdoglu.

123
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,860
How can I go on this road if
my blood brother is not staying behind...

124
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,100
...to protect and serve my tribe
in case something happens to me?

125
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,800
You shall be taking
my place until I return.

126
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,830
Put this on as well.

127
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,930
Do not feel cold on the road.

128
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,330
-Sister...
-Say it, my lion.

129
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,860
What if I can’t see you again?

130
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,060
What are you saying, Yigit?

131
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,500
We have weathered the storm together.
We have faced so many difficulties.

132
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,430
We will overcome this too.

133
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,800
But this time we are separated.
You will not be with us.

134
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,600
-What if those men take us and...
-Do not worry your pure heart like this.

135
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,030
Look, this time we are not alone.
There are Beys of the tribe.

136
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,830
They will protect us, they will care for us.

137
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,460
Always stay beside my father.
Do everything he says, alright?

138
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,100
And do not think about me.
I will sit here and wait for you.

139
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,830
There will be no sadness, do we agree?

140
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,160
Come on.

141
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,830
Now go...

142
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,960
...and say goodbye to your friends. Go on.

143
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,460
Father.

144
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,900
I am just talking so that
Yigit is not scared or gets sad but...

145
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,060
...my mind does not believe my own words.
How will it end?

146
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,860
My girl, it has been a very long time.

147
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,130
We went through many sorrows
by running away and getting captured.

148
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,800
This thing will finish once and for all,
if God permits.

149
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,060
Ertugrul has a plan.
I found it probable as well.

150
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,030
With God’s permission,
we shall go and come back.

151
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,600
This tribe paid a very big price for us.

152
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,200
We can never repay them for all they did.

153
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,430
Please let me.
Let me come with you as well.

154
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,260
Whatever happens, good or bad...

155
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,300
...we should be together at the end.

156
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,300
You pray for us, that is enough, my girl.

157
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,330
My precious and brave daughter with
a beautiful heart and a beautiful face.

158
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,430
Just like her mother, self sacrificing
and loyal. My beautiful daughter.

159
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,260
Do not worry.

160
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,060
Everything will be fine.

161
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,530
What happened? What do you want?

162
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
Come with us.

163
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,860
This carbuncle hurts just like a knife
on my back.

164
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,860
My Bey...

165
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,100
...your pain is my pain.
But there is nothing I can do.

166
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,230
All I can do is to pray
for you and my sons.

167
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,260
We went through so many sorrows,
so many journeys, so many battles.

168
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:12,360
We had the privilege to grow old.
Thank God, we have seen these days, Hayme.

169
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,100
You are right, my Bey.
We saw so many weddings, so many babies...

170
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,130
...so many springs.
We saw so many victories.

171
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,830
If God permits, we will continue
to see more.

172
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,930
I want your blessing.

173
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,160
Neither these troubles nor this life is permanent,
my Bey.

174
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,960
You always walked on the right path.
You never bowed to tyrants.

175
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,960
Has anyone seen a person
on the right path getting lost?

176
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,560
If God permits,
I will see you and my sons’ return.

177
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,160
May God be with you.

178
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,000
My blessing is with you.

179
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,400
Thank you.

180
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,030
What is it? What do you want?

181
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,560
Where are you coming from and
where are you headed to, Afsin Bey?

182
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,060
I want to hear what you are made of
from your mouth.

183
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,800
Dear God, please protect them.

184
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,860
You called for me, mother.

185
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,830
I did. Come and sit down.

186
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,200
Yes, mother?

187
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,360
Ertugrul Bey?

188
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,260
Do I have permission?

189
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,860
Halime Sultan comes to our tent,
does she need a permission?

190
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,430
Ertugrul Bey...

191
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,030
...I lied to you.

192
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,060
Yes, you did.

193
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,960
Do you understand now, why we had to go?

194
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,830
Why the days we spent in this tribe are
only a dream that we would wake up from?

195
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,560
You are happy here.

196
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,100
Despite a life you lived in a palace...

197
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,460
...you talk about a nomad life
like a dream, Halime.

198
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,800
Even if the whole world comes together...

199
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,130
...I will not let you become unhappy.

200
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,830
Do you understand me, my girl?

201
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,930
I did, mother.

202
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,600
Good.

203
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,600
You may go now.

204
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,160
Instead of reacting and
spewing out bitter words...

205
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:55,200
...recite God’s name, pray
and fill your heart with goodness...

206
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,100
...so that our fate would be good as well.

207
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,300
The problem is not my happiness.

208
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,400
The problem is my father’s
and my brother’s life.

209
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,100
Do not worry.

210
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,130
I will not let anything happen
to your father or your brother.

211
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,360
I will bring them back to you
safe and sound.

212
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,060
You can be rest assured.

213
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,060
You will go but you will also take
whatever is left of the ones...

214
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,100
...taken from my life, Ertugrul.

215
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,360
My father, my brother.

216
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,600
I beg you to return with them.

217
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,160
Return and complete
the thing that is missing inside me.

218
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,560
If I cannot make it back, know that...

219
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,160
...I have found everything in you,
which I felt missing inside me.

220
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,900
Their intention is not good, Gokce...

221
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,360
...they will let my man die
in the name of customs.

222
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,530
Sister, Suleyman Shah
is a human being as well.

223
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,960
Would a human let his child to be killed?
Get rid of these delusions from your mind.

224
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,100
You do not know Suleyman Shah yet.
He would even burn his tribe for customs.

225
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,600
I have to find a way, Gokce, I have to.

226
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,900
I will not let them sacrifice my man!

227
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,530
Dear God!

228
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Ertugrul’s Alps have prepared
their horses and weapons, waiting to go.

229
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,100
I have things to tell you, Kurdoglu.

230
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,130
What happened, Selcan Hatun?

231
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,200
Gundogdu trusts you, he respects you.
You know that.

232
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,800
What about you, Selcan Hatun?

233
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,160
-I have always trusted your bravery.
-Thank you.

234
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,230
What happened to Gundogdu is not
acceptable. But do not worry...

235
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,400
...Suleyman Shah will bring him back.
-No, he will not.

236
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,230
If you are brave, if you do not want
Suleyman Shah to throw...

237
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,130
...his tribe into fire,
if you respect Gundogdu a little bit...

238
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,830
If Suleyman Shah
does something like this...

239
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,600
...I would throw him into the fire myself.

240
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,900
Now I am listening to you, Selcan Hatun.

241
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,560
Suleyman Shah and Ertugrul...

242
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,530
...will ambush
Kara Toygar at the Falcon Hill.

243
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,500
-What are you saying, Selcan Hatun?
-I heard it with my own ears.

244
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,230
Suleyman Shah decided to be loyal
to his customs rather than his son!

245
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,930
Do not tell this to anyone, Selcan Hatun.
And you did not talk with me...

246
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,860
...we did not see each other.
Alright, Selcan Hatun?

247
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,900
What will happen to Gundogdu?

248
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,330
We will find a solution.

249
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,830
Go on, get out before anyone sees you.

250
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,030
Will we let them go, my Bey?

251
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,030
We will, so that Kara Toygar’s hunt
can be more fruitful, Alpargu.

252
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,130
I cleansed the tribe from all filth
without drawing a sword...

253
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,360
...or getting blood on my hands.

254
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,860
Come on, get on your horse.
I have things to tell to Kara Toygar.

255
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,930
I swear on the horses
that run endlessly...

256
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,060
I swear on the horseshoes that sparkle...

257
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:21,860
If I am scared to die for our tribe,
for our Bey, for our customs...

258
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,830
...may I be slayed by my own steel sword,
like a crop in the field.

259
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,400
May the blue sky tear,
may the brave ground sink...

260
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,130
...may my name be erased
from all monuments.

261
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:42,860
May my forefather Oguz,
my blessed tribe sue me in the next life!

262
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,060
In this path I have taken,
may God be by my side...

263
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,330
...may Godsend Hidr accompany me.

264
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,160
Come on, Titus. Relax a bit.

265
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,500
Today is our day.

266
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,500
We will both get what we want.

267
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,960
You were this comfortable
when Ertugrul was going to Aleppo as well.

268
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,330
You were this relaxed.
Then we know what happened.

269
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,130
Your soldiers’ incompetence.

270
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,330
Sir, Suleyman Shah.

271
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,560
Let us not make our visitors wait.
Let them in.

272
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,600
He came alone, sir.

273
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,900
Bring him here immediately.

274
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,000
Now you will have to take a pot luck, Kara Toygar?

275
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,330
You, what are you up to, Suleyman Shah?
Where are they?

276
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,060
You will get what you want
after you release my son.

277
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,900
Do you have a death wish?

278
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,900
Are my and my son’s lives more valuable
than your Shahzadas?

279
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,030
You will free Gundogdu, Kara Toygar!

280
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,830
Are you threatening me?

281
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,230
If something happens to Gundogdu...

282
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,430
...Ertugrul will take them outside
Seljuk territory.

283
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,500
You will never find them again.

284
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,160
Neither you, nor the Templars you serve.

285
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,560
If you free my son...

286
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,230
...I will take them to you.

287
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,160
Where are they?

288
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,460
I have left them with Ertugrul
to prevent their escape.

289
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,600
If something happens to us...

290
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,000
...Sultan Aladdin will be
informed of everything.

291
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,000
Shahzada has told everything to
Sultan Aladdin in a letter he wrote.

292
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,230
He wrote how he was held in the hands of
the Templars for months...

293
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,300
...how he was tortured and forced
to be the Sultan...

294
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:31,800
...how he didn’t betray his state
despite those tortures...

295
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,500
...that you were colluding with the Templars...

296
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
...in short, everything.

297
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,530
The decision is yours.

298
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,160
Father?

299
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,260
My son.

300
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,330
What happened?

301
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,830
-Did you give the prisoners to Kara Toygar?
-No.

302
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,130
-Father?
-Kara Toygar freed you.

303
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,030
Go to the tribe.

304
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,230
-Father, that man would not let you live.
-Do as I tell you, Gundogdu.

305
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,800
Go now.

306
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,930
Father.

307
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,160
-Be quick.
-Go on.

308
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,860
I said go!

309
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,400
What happened, Akcakoca?
Is there someone inside?

310
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,930
What is happening here?
What is this outrage?

311
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,030
Get out of the way, Akcakoca.
We want to see who is inside.

312
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,600
-What is it to you?
-I said get out of the way!

313
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,300
The things we heard are true!

314
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,060
Stop! Stop! Stop!

315
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
What do you think you are doing?

316
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,230
Our sons have died, Mother Hayme.
All because of them!

317
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,030
They ambushed the caravan
but you didn't tell us!

318
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,200
So you violate our customs and our Bey.

319
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,030
-Shame on you all!
-That is enough, Mother Hayme.

320
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,180
You are saying customs but how many more
lives shall be sacrificed?

321
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,200
Where are the bodies of our sons?

322
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,420
-Where is Suleyman Shah?
-My son has died, not yours, Mother Hayme.

323
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:41,100
Everyone in this tribe is my child,
my heart!

324
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,330
Tribe survives, when there is unity.

325
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:53,600
If the unity is disrupted, you are fated
to be defeated by the enemy.

326
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,900
Suleyman Shah Bey
ever put his own live before yours?

327
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,500
Has he ever put his own sons before yours,
has he ever chose a path other than...

328
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,200
...the goodness of the tribe?

329
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,420
Whatever he does, he does for the welfare,
for the future of the tribe.

330
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,420
Breaking the unity of the tribe in his absence,
to cry out mutiny...

331
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,420
...is this what you see befitting
for yourselves?

332
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,330
If you try to crush the customs...

333
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,960
...you will be crushed one day.

334
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,960
From now on, anyone stoning them...

335
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,060
...would be stoning me!

336
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,460
Anyone who faces them, would be facing me!

337
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,560
Let this be known!

338
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,460
Come, my girl!

339
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,830
KARA TOYGAR
CARAVANSARY

340
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,560
They are playing with you.

341
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,160
How did they learn our relationship,
Titus?

342
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,100
Ertugrul.

343
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,230
It was a matter of time for him
to connect the dots.

344
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,230
God damn it! I need to kill them all.

345
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,560
What will happen to the letter
Shahzada wrote to the Sultan?

346
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:47,130
My fellows in the palace will prevent
the Sultan from receiving the letter.

347
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,900
I hope so.

348
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:13,830
They will see who the prey and who the hunter is?

349
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,400
God forbid, I was so afraid that
something would happen to you.

350
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,800
If something happened to you,
what could I have said to Suleyman Shah?

351
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,060
Stay here until they return.

352
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,430
We would accompany each other
while waiting for our beloved ones’ return.

353
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,930
With prayer, with faith, with patience.

354
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,600
This tribe has survived
so many hardships.

355
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,530
All the pain is still here...

356
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,130
...in my heart.

357
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,560
God knows that I have never felt
so desperate in my life.

358
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,800
My two sons...

359
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,500
...my man...

360
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,230
In my short life, I have seen
so much trouble.

361
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,300
The ones who wanted to kill my father
and brother...

362
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,330
...states that wanted to use them
since they are Shahzadas...

363
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,960
...nights we spent in dungeons.

364
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,830
Every single breath for each day was
with the fear of losing my loved ones.

365
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,430
Ertugrul Bey woke us up
from that nightmare...

366
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,860
...he put us in a beautiful dream.

367
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,860
Mother Hayme...

368
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,930
...I found the peace I yearned
for my whole life in your tribe.

369
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,930
You have what you wanted.

370
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,960
Now it is my turn, Suleyman Shah.
