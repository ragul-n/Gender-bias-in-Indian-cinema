1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:03,398
<i>Previously on</i> Madam Secretary...

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:06,662
You will sign this deal,
or my government will bury you.

3
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:08,092
We know that you have a spy

4
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:10,276
<i>in my inner circle. If you tell us</i>

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,445
who that is, we will have a deal.

6
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,565
I promise I will do everything
in my power to keep you safe.

7
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:16,738
<i>- There he is.</i>
- Abort!

8
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:17,568
- Abort!
- What?

9
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:18,584
Did we just give him up?

10
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,704
I have to put national security first.

11
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:21,784
Why couldn't you talk him out of it?

12
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:23,914
He's an old spy, for God's sake!

13
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:25,824
This is what happens when you try

14
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,704
<i>to make a deal with the devil.</i>

15
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,515
<i>You will both regret this.</i>

16
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:33,244
(whooshing)

17
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:35,345
(explosion booms)

18
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,664
(wind blowing)

19
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,765
(indistinct shouting)

20
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,765
(sirens wailing in distance)

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,761
MAN: Falcon secured.
Repeat, Falcon secured.

22
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:02,681
Initiate Evac Protocol Zion.

23
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:04,091
What the hell just happened?

24
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:05,841
That was Maria Ostrov's car.

25
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:07,974
- Son of a bitch. - We've initiated
emergency evacuation protocol, sir.

26
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:10,471
Air Force One will be
wheels up in nine minutes.

27
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:12,551
Copy that. They're trying to pull Ostrov

28
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:13,554
- from the wreck.
- Is she alive?

29
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:14,732
Unknown, sir.

30
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:18,841
I want to stay behind in Geneva,

31
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:21,632
- see if I can liaise with the Russians.
- Negative, ma'am.

32
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,131
The attackers might have other targets.

33
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:24,841
If Maria Ostrov dies,

34
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:26,551
this peace deal likely dies with her.

35
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:29,471
With respect, sir...

36
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:31,572
Do it.

37
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,631
(sirens wailing)

38
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:38,631
We've set up a meeting place
for you and General Doroshevich.

39
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:39,512
Come this way.

40
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:40,391
Okay. Thanks.

41
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,432
More bad news.

42
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,471
Of course there is.

43
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:44,801
A radical Ukrainian nationalist
group called Knights of Kiev

44
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:46,801
took credit for the
attack on Maria Ostrov.

45
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,221
(sighs)

46
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:49,841
God, are the Russians
losing their minds?

47
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:51,511
What do you think?

48
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,011
This is the group's
leader, Olek Zelinski.

49
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:56,011
He made a statement saying
that the peace deal

50
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:58,011
was a capitulation to Russia
and any further attempts

51
00:01:58,012 --> 00:02:01,402
to change Ukraine's border
will be met with more violence.

52
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:05,261
Do they have any ties to
the Ukrainian government

53
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:08,134
- or Bozek? - CIA's best guess
is no, but it's not definitive.

54
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:12,221
Okay, um, reach out
to the Swiss. Ask them

55
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:14,471
if they'll ground Melnik's plane
until I can talk to him.

56
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:16,474
- Tell 'em the ask is coming from
the White House. - (phone ringing)

57
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,094
- I...
- Ma'am, uh, I'm just...

58
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,591
I'm glad that you're still with us.

59
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:22,591
You, too. I-I got to take this.

60
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,591
Yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:25,979
ELIZABETH: <i>Henry?</i>

62
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,149
Thank God you're okay.

63
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,729
I-I'm fine. I'm fine.

64
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,529
I... Blake called the kids,
so don't worry.

65
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,529
He said you weren't home.
Where are you?

66
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,979
I can't say.

67
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,269
Listen, about what happened...

68
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,939
I can't really talk
about that right now.

69
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,149
I don't... I don't mean
right now. I was thinking

70
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,149
when we get home.

71
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,830
I don't know when that will be.

72
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,870
Okay.

73
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,189
I understand that, but...

74
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,399
I love you.

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,479
I love you, too.

76
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,460
I've got to go.

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,500
(beep)

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,540
(indistinct chatter)

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,979
She didn't make it.

80
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,080
(exhales)

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,439
FELLOWS:<i> Look, you got
burnt by the higher-ups.</i>

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,189
<i>It's part of the job... believe me.</i>

83
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,319
I didn't get burned.

84
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,979
Dmitri did.

85
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,399
Wherever the Russians have him,
he's paying for it now.

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,399
Well, he did it to save his sister.

87
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,319
And that's what we're
here to do, Henry.

88
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,269
We have to get to Talia
before the Russians do.

89
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,479
Because they will leverage
her to get more information.

90
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,609
What about Dmitri? Is there any news?

91
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,269
The fact that they're on
the hunt for his sister

92
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,479
means he's still alive.

93
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,479
And if he's still alive, there's hope.

94
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,689
One good thing about the
Maria Ostrov situation is

95
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,769
it throws a lot of cards up in the air.

96
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,819
Dmitri could be one of 'em.

97
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,830
Let's go.

98
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,729
I appreciate your condolences,
Madam Secretary.

99
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,717
But they won't bring
back President Ostrova,

100
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:01,729
nor will they alter
the fact that Ukraine

101
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,479
abrogated the ceasefire
by assassinating her.

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,439
President Ostrova wanted peace.

103
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,769
She didn't.

104
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,029
I still don't know what you

105
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,359
and your president said to her
in that room to get her to sign.

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,609
In any event, she signed the treaty.

107
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,939
I think we should honor her legacy

108
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,899
by preserving her last
and greatest act.

109
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,069
Prime Minister Salnikov
has just been sworn in

110
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,569
as acting president.

111
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,149
He has declared an
official mourning period.

112
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,149
But in three days' time, believe me,

113
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,319
the Ukrainians will be made to pay

114
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,479
for this treachery.

115
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,529
General, I...

116
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,769
I understand your outrage.

117
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,029
And I share it.

118
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,318
But I must warn you,

119
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,318
should you resume hostilities,

120
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,318
the United States reserves the right

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,158
to use all means

122
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,419
to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty.

123
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,658
All means, General.

124
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,618
Well,

125
00:04:56,619 --> 00:05:00,158
we have said what we needed to say.

126
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:03,839
Good day, Madam Secretary.

127
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:09,169
(sighs)

128
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,358
HENRY: <i>When I told Dmitri</i>

129
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,278
I was coming here for a conference,

130
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,488
he asked me to come talk to you.

131
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,158
So you just show up
and tell me I must go

132
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,818
to the United States,

133
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:26,618
on the very day that
President Ostrova is murdered?

134
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,618
I think Dmitri was worried

135
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:33,198
that this conflict could
get out of control.

136
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,198
He wants you to go somewhere
where he knows you'll be safe.

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,158
And he turned to you because
your wife is Secretary of State.

138
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,568
Well, as I said, we became
friendly at the War College.

139
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:43,738
But, yeah, I think

140
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:45,738
my wife might have played a part in it.

141
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:47,408
Wouldn't that make him a traitor?

142
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:51,618
I think his first loyalty is
and always will be you.

143
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,278
You should have seen him when
he heard about the drug trial.

144
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,799
He would not stop badgering
them until they let you in.

145
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,778
Yes. (chuckles)

146
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,959
He saved my life.

147
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,158
Professor McCord,

148
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,158
I want to trust you.

149
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:13,169
I'm going to ask you
to be honest with me.

150
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:17,379
Tell me where my brother is.

151
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,118
I don't know.

152
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,238
Then I can't trust you.

153
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,238
That's the truth.

154
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,219
It's not good enough.

155
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,908
Talia, listen to me.

156
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,358
If agents from your government

157
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,948
come and demand that you
go with them, don't do it.

158
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,028
Run.

159
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,278
Do you understand me?

160
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,278
What good would that do?

161
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,858
They always catch you.

162
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,658
Besides, I should have
been dead months ago.

163
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,068
I was resurrected in Stockholm,
thanks to my brother.

164
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:51,169
So I'm going to wait right here,
where he can find me.

165
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,448
ELIZABETH: <i>Minister Melnik.</i>

166
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,618
Why on earth would we kill
the Russian president

167
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:00,448
less than a day after she
agreed to end the war?

168
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,118
And yet President Bozek
hid out in Ukraine

169
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,068
instead of coming to the peace talks.

170
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,419
Sure looks like he knew to stay away.

171
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:14,719
Matt, Frank, can I
have the room, please?

172
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,858
He was crazy enough
to hack Air Force One.

173
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:27,618
Why should I believe he wouldn't
order a hit on Maria Ostrov?

174
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,198
What do you want from me?
Should I pretend to be sad

175
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,988
for the insane Russian dictator
who invaded my country?

176
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:35,158
Well, I won't.

177
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,705
The bitch got what she deserved,
Madam Secretary,

178
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:38,994
and you know it.

179
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:42,545
You're not exactly
helping your case here.

180
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:48,925
Did you or your president give
the green light to Zelinski?

181
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:52,354
Must be so nice to be American.

182
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,774
To play God all the time.

183
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,144
Speaking of playing God,

184
00:07:57,145 --> 00:08:00,144
you're aware we have
an extradition treaty

185
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:01,234
with Switzerland.

186
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:02,644
By this time tomorrow,

187
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:05,404
you could be in federal
court, being arraigned

188
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:07,984
on terrorism charges for
attacking Air Force One.

189
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:10,644
I know that you were up
to your neck in that,

190
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:12,854
right there with Bozek.

191
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:15,354
So you and I need to get real clear

192
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:17,274
on a few things right now.
Do you understand?

193
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:20,024
Nothing you can do to me will be
worse than what will happen

194
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:22,234
to my people if the
Russians resume their war.

195
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,444
And that's gonna happen
in three days' time,

196
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,104
unless your government

197
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,524
gives them Zelinski.

198
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,524
I have no idea where he is.

199
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,944
Well, you better find him.
Or help us do it.

200
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:37,444
Because if the Russians
get him before we do,

201
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:39,444
we don't have any cards to play.

202
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:40,814
And they<i> are</i> out for blood.

203
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:43,314
President Bozek didn't order the hit.

204
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,404
And he certainly doesn't condone it.

205
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:51,404
Zelinski is a psychopath
masquerading as a patriot.

206
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,404
Oh, see,

207
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:56,404
that sounds like an excellent
start to the speech

208
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,604
you're about to give.

209
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:02,205
That is, if you want to go home.

210
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:06,765
BLAKE: Yeah, so it's just that, and
then if you'd just sign the ones

211
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,185
on top, that'd be great. Thanks.

212
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:10,765
I've been away for, like, two days.

213
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,395
What, did I buy another
house while I was gone?

214
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:14,895
Uh, also, you are scheduled

215
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:17,435
to update POTUS on developments
with Russia tomorrow morning

216
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:18,436
at 9:00 a.m.

217
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:19,435
Oh, speaking of which...

218
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:20,081
Hi, Mommy.

219
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:20,725
Hi, baby.

220
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,265
Any word on their reaction

221
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:23,331
to Melnik's speech?

222
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:24,395
They remain unmoved.

223
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,555
Oh. Well, on that cheery note,

224
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:29,055
unless there's anything else,

225
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:31,395
this is, I believe,
where we call it a night.

226
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,935
Um...

227
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:36,315
What?

228
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,975
You know what,
it is hardly worth mentioning

229
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:39,026
at such a perilous time.

230
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:40,865
And yet...

231
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,405
I'm going to get kicked out of school.

232
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:43,655
What?

233
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:44,656
(chuckles) Kids.

234
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:45,655
Wait, what?

235
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:48,865
Okay. So, while strictly
speaking that is true,

236
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,325
um, what you should know is...

237
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:51,988
- Well, here's what I know.
- Why don't you start?

238
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:52,617
Yep.

239
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:54,406
Okay. You know how you
and Dad are supposed

240
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:55,525
to do mandatory volunteer hours

241
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:56,736
at my school?

242
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:57,945
Let's just whistle by

243
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:00,865
that oxymoron and say yes, I'm aware.

244
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,115
Well, you guys have
done zero this year.

245
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:05,735
Well, I-I've been a little busy.

246
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:08,325
So has Dr. McCord. Which I have
explained to the dean's office

247
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:11,405
numerous times in our
many, many e-mails

248
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:12,991
back and forth.

249
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:14,575
But they remain unmoved?

250
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,615
Unless you and your husband

251
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,825
volunteer at least three
hours this semester,

252
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:22,735
they reserve the right to... disinvite

253
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:23,841
Alison next year.

254
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:24,945
Oh.

255
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:27,945
Well, you got to hand
it to the Quakers.

256
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:29,695
They use nonthreatening language

257
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,945
even when they're threatening you.

258
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:34,735
So you and Dad have to work
a booth at the Winter Carnival

259
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:35,841
on Wednesday or else.

260
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:36,945
(sighs)

261
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,365
You tell those Quakers

262
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:40,485
they drive a harder bargain
than the Russians.

263
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:42,075
And the McCords

264
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,825
will represent.

265
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,655
On that note,

266
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:46,825
I'm going to bed. Love you.

267
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:47,826
Love you.

268
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:48,825
Love you.

269
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,235
That was awkward.

270
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:51,716
Right.

271
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:54,136
DALTON:<i> All right,
so where is Zelinski?</i>

272
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:56,765
Gone to ground, sir.
However, intel indicates

273
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,265
he may be hiding out with
his followers in the forest

274
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,845
somewhere in Western Ukraine.

275
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:03,135
Not exactly pinpoint accuracy, Admiral.

276
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:05,135
We're working the problem, sir.
But, Mr. President,

277
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:07,055
I must tell you, he and his group

278
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,925
are heavily armed
and expecting a fight.

279
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:10,975
If we can find Zelinski
in two days' time,

280
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:12,805
taking him alive won't be easy.

281
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,345
There will be casualties, sir.

282
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:16,555
The idea of doing any more dirty work

283
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:18,515
for that bastard Bozek makes me sick.

284
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:21,175
What we need right now is leverage,

285
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:23,425
and it is in short supply.

286
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:27,015
Zelinski is our best shot
to keep the Russians

287
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,305
from breaking the treaty
and relaunching the war.

288
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:31,175
But if that happens,
there's no telling how long

289
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,975
we can contain the
battle space to Ukraine.

290
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,215
The conflict could become global.

291
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:37,215
Find Zelinski, Admiral.

292
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:39,116
Yes, sir.

293
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:49,268
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

294
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,299
(knocking)

295
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,485
So, hi.

296
00:11:57,486 --> 00:12:00,866
Hi. Those were some
pretty urgent texts.

297
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,116
What's up?

298
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:03,446
You know that I would never

299
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:04,786
trade on our personal relationship

300
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,696
unless it was an emergency, right?

301
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:09,076
Glenn, we don't exactly have

302
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,156
a personal relationship anymore.

303
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:13,536
I know. No, we had three lovely months,

304
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:15,156
followed by a sudden, painful lunch.

305
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:16,326
Oh.

306
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:18,366
You know I was
coming out of a very long

307
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,746
and very difficult relationship.

308
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:22,406
Look, I'm sorry, it's not
important right now.

309
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:24,866
If I told you I needed
the secretary's help,

310
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,746
could you get me some time with her?

311
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,196
Like, today?

312
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:31,986
Well, given she's Secretary of State,

313
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,946
not space...

314
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,076
what exactly are you hoping

315
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:36,696
she can help you with?

316
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:39,286
Saving the lives of six astronauts.

317
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:40,446
<i>Approximately four hours ago,</i>

318
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,246
the North Koreans launched a satellite,

319
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:45,406
uh, without proper preclearance

320
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:48,076
from NASA or other
relevant space agencies.

321
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:49,406
Isn't that the third time

322
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:50,826
they've done that this year?

323
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:52,536
The fourth, actually.

324
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:56,156
The North Koreans are
sometimes less than helpful.

325
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:59,576
Uh, their satellite
exploded in low orbit,

326
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:02,326
100 kilometers below the
International Space Station.

327
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:05,786
The force of that explosion
propelled debris

328
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,366
into the ISS, which has sustained

329
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,446
significant damage.

330
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:13,246
The lives of all six astronauts
aboard are in peril,

331
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:14,826
but particularly those

332
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,196
of the three trapped here, two
Americans and one from Japan.

333
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,246
They are without their E.M.U.'s.

334
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:23,906
Oh, sorry... their
extravehicular mobility units.

335
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,116
Their-their space suits.

336
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:27,076
And two of the modules

337
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:28,906
between them and the
nearest escape capsule

338
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,246
are depressurized.

339
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,036
What about the three
Russian cosmonauts?

340
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,406
The escape capsule

341
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,286
nearest them has been
compromised by debris,

342
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:39,156
so they're also trapped on
the station, but they have

343
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:40,246
taken shelter in this module

344
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,446
on the opposite side of the station.

345
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:46,406
Which remains pressurized, so
they're safe for the time being.

346
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,366
Sorry, not an astrophysicist,

347
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,406
but can't the Russians just

348
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:52,656
bring the Americans extra space suits?

349
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,326
Uh, well, yes and no.

350
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:55,986
But... but mostly no.

351
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:57,986
That would require a space walk

352
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,286
outside the station,

353
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,616
to then pass E.M.U.'s
through an air lock

354
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:03,196
to our guys, and,

355
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:05,196
unfortunately, the suits are too bulky

356
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:07,196
to be placed in the air lock.

357
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,246
This is where the secretary comes in.

358
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,286
The Russians, in their wisdom,

359
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:14,036
are planning to send up an unmanned

360
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,906
Soyuz rescue capsule.

361
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:18,246
They've been developing a new

362
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:20,326
modular E.M.U. suit.

363
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,286
Yeah, these are suits
that could be taken apart

364
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:25,036
and then handed piece by piece

365
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:27,616
through the air lock here
at the end of Kibo Lab.

366
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,656
Let me guess: Russians don't
actually have the suits yet.

367
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:33,116
A tragically excellent guess.

368
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:34,866
Uh, but the good news

369
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,446
is the Chinese just might have
some that are ready to go.

370
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:40,246
You won't be surprised
to learn that China

371
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,826
has been covertly
cribbing Russian technology

372
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:45,406
as well as our own to develop

373
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:46,677
their own space program.

374
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,946
Okay, so in order

375
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,326
to save the astronauts,

376
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:51,486
the secretary has to strike a deal

377
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:54,696
with two of the most prideful
nations on Earth, one of which

378
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:56,116
we're currently fighting in a war?

379
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,616
When does the Soyuz lift off?

380
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:59,576
In 14 hours.

381
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,486
They either need to repair

382
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:04,446
vital systems on the
station or get off of it.

383
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,076
In order to do either,
they need the suits.

384
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,446
Or they'll die.

385
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,076
HENRY: <i>So what's your plan...</i>

386
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,406
just let her get picked
up by the Russians?

387
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,986
I told you, we have people stationed

388
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:17,536
all around that hospital. That's not

389
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:19,159
- gonna happen.
- But you can't leave a team

390
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,486
in Stockholm forever.

391
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,576
Oh, you got that right.

392
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:23,406
Upstairs is already sweating me.

393
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,746
What did they say
about reading Talia in?

394
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:28,036
It's under consideration.

395
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:29,576
Look, the only way

396
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:31,906
to get her to trust us
is if I can tell her

397
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,366
what my real connection to Dmitri is.

398
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,616
Look, I understand your
frustration, Henry.

399
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,196
I don't think you do.

400
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:38,948
- The least we can do for Dmitri
at this point - (phone buzzes)

401
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:40,527
is to guarantee his
sister's protection.

402
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:42,197
We need to get her into our custody.

403
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,157
So, what, you just want to
grab her up off the street?

404
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:46,236
Yes. For her sake and Dmitri's,

405
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,217
yes, absolutely.

406
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:48,196
(phone buzzes)

407
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,337
(sighs)

408
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:53,127
What is it?

409
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:56,566
Our sources indicate that the Russians

410
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,797
are standing down on
trying to find Talia.

411
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:05,467
Because they don't need her anymore.

412
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,167
I'm sorry, Henry.

413
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:18,217
He was 24 years old.

414
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,297
24.

415
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:29,087
Where are you going?

416
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,276
To give Talia the news.

417
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:34,377
I owe her brother that much.

418
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:49,784
ELIZABETH: <i>So we've blocked China</i>

419
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:52,865
from participation on the
International Space Station,

420
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,575
and now we need their help to save it?

421
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,155
Oh, they are gonna love this.

422
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:00,075
I mean, this is going
to make their day.

423
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:03,075
To be fair, China was
banned by Congress

424
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:05,865
over concerns about
intellectual property theft.

425
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:08,115
Which have since been
borne out, obviously.

426
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:09,523
Yes, well, guess who's about to lose

427
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,413
a whole lot of leverage
in that argument.

428
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:16,602
But these modular space suits...
if the Chinese

429
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,732
admit that they have them
and the Russians allow us

430
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,392
to send them up,

431
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:22,123
they can save our astronauts?

432
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:24,652
Well, we can't say for sure,

433
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,163
but they are the best chance we've got.

434
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:31,982
Well, just so you know,
this call is going to entail

435
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,361
what we in diplomatic circles

436
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:37,212
refer to as me eating
a big plate of crap.

437
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:40,271
Roger that, ma'am.

438
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:43,481
I'm sorry, I can't help
but smile at the irony.

439
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:44,981
Yes, I-I wish

440
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:48,811
we could savor it all day,
but we're running out of time.

441
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:50,731
The Soyuz is set to lift off

442
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,441
from Kazakhstan in ten hours.

443
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,231
Would China be willing to send

444
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:55,811
the space suits or not?

445
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:58,481
If we had such suits...
what were they called again?

446
00:17:58,482 --> 00:17:59,861
Modular extravehicular

447
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,941
mobility units.

448
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:04,571
You see, the nomenclature eludes me.

449
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:06,481
But if we had such suits to offer,

450
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:08,521
we would want something in return.

451
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,861
Beyond the opportunity
to save six astronauts?

452
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:15,271
From a crisis not of our
making, on a space station

453
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:17,611
from which we have been
humiliatingly blocked.

454
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:21,441
You turned a blind eye to your
client state North Korea's

455
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:24,941
reckless satellite launches,
which precipitated said event.

456
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:26,941
So "not of our making"

457
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:29,651
is debatable, to say the least.

458
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:31,651
You have a peculiar way of asking

459
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,731
for a favor, Madam Secretary.

460
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:35,571
Our president is prepared

461
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,571
to lobby Congress to lift

462
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:39,901
the NASA exclusion policy

463
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:43,021
and unblock China's
participation on the ISS.

464
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,361
I'll convey your request and get
back to you with an answer.

465
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:49,372
Quickly, please.

466
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:51,811
I have POTUS on the phone.

467
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,752
Oh.

468
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,691
Mr. President.

469
00:18:56,692 --> 00:19:01,441
Bess, I wanted to tell you that
I received a report from DIA.

470
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:03,571
It confirms that Captain Dmitri Petrov

471
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:05,042
has died in Russia.

472
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,832
I see.

473
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:13,771
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. President.

474
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:15,912
I just thought you should know.

475
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:18,872
Thank you, sir.

476
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,872
Hi.

477
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:37,787
Hey.

478
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:41,611
I'm so glad you're all right.

479
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:43,481
I'm all right, I'm fine.
Are you all right?

480
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,151
I'm just really tired. I'll go to bed.

481
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,691
I have to teach tomorrow.

482
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,731
Well, maybe you could take the day off.

483
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:50,731
No. (sighs)

484
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,981
Oh, I got the e-mail about
Alison's school thing.

485
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:54,401
I'll be there.

486
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,172
Good. I-I heard about Dmitri.

487
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,611
I'm so sorry, Henry.

488
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:02,691
Aren't we all?

489
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:04,901
It was the right call.
I know you understand that.

490
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,271
Intellectually, yeah.

491
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,071
But we were right there.

492
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:09,481
He was a couple yards away.

493
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:11,571
All we had to do was open the van door.

494
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:14,212
When I think about
how he must have died...

495
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:18,901
Look, I love you, but I can't
talk about this right now.

496
00:20:18,902 --> 00:20:21,111
I'm afraid I might say something
that I can't take back.

497
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:22,672
So can we do it later?

498
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:25,941
Yeah.

499
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:27,691
Okay, um...

500
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,792
(phone buzzes)

501
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,631
So China's in?

502
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:39,711
Ugh, not yet.

503
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:41,051
They have conditions.

504
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:42,591
Shocker.

505
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:44,341
They want recognition
as a space partner...

506
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:46,921
technology sharing, inclusion
on the space station.

507
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:48,671
That's gonna take an act of Congress,

508
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:50,801
which is not going to happen

509
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:53,881
in the few hours before the launch.

510
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:57,671
But we need 'em, so
promise them the moon.

511
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:00,352
Well, not the actual moon.
That would be crazy.

512
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,801
I'm a little tired.

513
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:05,341
Bold language, vague specifics.
Understood.

514
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:07,751
Until we can get Russia
to agree to take their help,

515
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,711
which is a big if.

516
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:11,751
You'll need to tread carefully.

517
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,961
Glenn. She's Secretary of State.

518
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:14,672
She's aware.

519
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,381
No, I mean,

520
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:16,991
the Russians are proud
of their space program.

521
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:18,871
Like, really proud.

522
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:20,451
They would rather let our guys die

523
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:21,781
than be publicly caught

524
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:22,677
taking China's help.

525
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:23,571
Got it.

526
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,164
- Uh, ma'am...
- Just the man I want to see.

527
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:27,821
I need a SVTC call with
General Doroshevich right away.

528
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:29,661
Yes, ma'am, but they've
located Zelinski

529
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:31,215
at his hideout in Ukraine.

530
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:32,295
An operation is getting underway,

531
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:34,566
so you're wanted at
the White House ASAP.

532
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:35,896
This comes first.

533
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,295
MAN: <i>Madam Secretary,</i>

534
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,335
we are aware that the
Chinese have modular

535
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:42,585
extravehicular mobility suits

536
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,465
developed on our prototype.

537

Oh. I see.

538
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:49,625
If the Chinese can deliver them
prior to our launch time,

539
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:51,545
we are willing to put
them on the Soyuz.

540
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:54,965
ELIZABETH: Well, that is very
gracious of you, General.

541
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:57,545
Yes, we Russians choose kindness,

542
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:59,335
even in our grief.

543
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:02,375
The suits are Russian
in design and therefore

544
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:04,375
will be described as such.

545
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:06,755
If the Chinese are
mentioned, we will deny it.

546
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:08,045
If a rescue is effected,

547
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:10,294
Russia will receive sole credit.

548
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,373
But given the debris
around the station,

549
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,452
most likely such an attempt
will be unadvised.

550
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:18,252
And, of course, the capsule
can only carry three persons.

551
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,712
Our cosmonauts have been
ordered to depart with it.

552
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:24,252
Of course. I understand completely.

553
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,332
Good night, Madam Secretary.

554
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,103
Good night.

555
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:34,912

even in their grief.

You tell your president to hand
Zelinski over to the Russians,

695

Then a small measure of justice

00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:33,995
But more importantly,

714
00:29:33,996 --> 00:29:38,375
Ukraine wants assurance that
with this gesture of good faith,

715
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:43,325
the peace deal signed by
President Ostrova will hold.

716
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:44,915
That I cannot give.

717
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,415
Why not?

718
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:48,205
Our president signed a peace treaty.

719
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:50,325
She was then murdered
by our adversaries,

720
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:52,165
which nullifies the peace treaty

721
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,915
and any belief in Ukraine's good faith.

722
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,875
General, I'm gonna be blunt.

723
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:59,115
You weren't winning the war.

724
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:01,915
What makes you think this
time will be any different?

725
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:04,745
The people are with us now,
and so is the winter.

726
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:07,325
When your handful of
advisors begin dying

727
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:09,165
in the snow halfway around the world,

728
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,285
how long do you think

729
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:12,245
the American public will stand for it?

730
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:14,676
You don't want to find out.

731
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,325
Take Zelinski, General.

732
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:20,875
Take the deal.

733
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:22,705
We end our period of mourning

734
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:25,415
for our late president in a few hours.

735
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:30,596
And then we will see how
strong your resolve is.

736
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:36,176
Ma'am, you're gonna want to see this.

737
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:40,205
We're patched into the Russian feed.

738
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,705
(man speaking Russian)

739
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,415
WOMAN (translating):
Station, this is Flight.

740
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:48,205
Positive latching of
the vehicle confirmed.

741
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:49,575
We have a good dock.

742
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:51,705
(man speaking Russian)

743
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:53,705
Station, this is Flight.

744
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:57,285
The debris environment
is too hazardous.

745
00:30:57,286 --> 00:31:00,375
You are a no-go for
extravehicular activity.

746
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:02,375
Begin station evacuation operations.

747
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:05,115
Damn it. What good are the suits
if our guys can't get them?

748
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:06,955
WOMAN (translating):
Negative, Mission Control.

749
00:31:06,956 --> 00:31:10,995
We will attempt a rescue of
our colleagues in Kibo Lab.

750
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:14,825
(man speaking Russian)

751
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:17,995
Negative, Station.
You are no-go for E.V.A.

752
00:31:17,996 --> 00:31:19,621
Shut up, dude.

753
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:21,245
Repeat, you are a no-go for E.V.A.

754
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,995
(speaking Russian)

755
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:24,285
WOMAN (translating): Negative, Flight.

756
00:31:24,286 --> 00:31:25,915
Beginning preparations for E.V.A.

757
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,245
ASTRONAUT:
Lev, this is Station Commander.

758
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:29,575
I concur with your ground controller.

759
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:31,375
You are no-go for E.V.A.

760
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:33,995
Don't risk your lives for us, buddy.

761
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:36,285
Proceed to the Soyuz
capsule and depart.

762
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:37,955
Negative, Station Commander.

763
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:40,915
Prepare the air lock to
receive the modular E.M.U.'s.

764
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:43,035
We are coming for you, James.

765
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,096
Well, how about that.

766
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:01,456
ELIZABETH: Mr. President?

767
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:08,985
So the war's back on in a few hours.

768
00:32:08,986 --> 00:32:13,275
Well, barring any
last-minute breakthroughs,

769
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:17,485
that's the message Doroshevich
is sending, yes, sir.

770
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:20,815
What do we know about
Acting President Salnikov?

771
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:24,275
He was in Pavel Ostrov's
circle for many years.

772
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,735
Other than that, not much.

773
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,775
Which is probably why

774
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:30,565
Maria Ostrov chose him
to be her prime minister.

775
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:32,626
Hmm.

776
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:37,445
If only those cosmonauts were
running the show over there.

777
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:40,586
That would help.

778
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:46,956
You okay, Bess?

779
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:51,506
Me? Yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm fine.

780
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:58,775
I was just thinking

781
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:02,405
about all the lives that
we've lost trying to make

782
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:04,405
this peace deal work.

783
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:08,695
Anton Gorev, the Delta Force team.

784
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,565
Yeah, Henry's asset.

785
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:13,485
I just feel like

786
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:16,235
I'm-I'm moving all these lives around

787
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:18,315
on this chessboard.

788
00:33:18,316 --> 00:33:20,546
And for what?

789
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:25,695
I'm sorry, sir.

790
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:27,315
That's not... it...

791
00:33:27,316 --> 00:33:30,735
it's not productive and...

792
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:34,115
No, like I said, you know, I am...

793
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:36,336
I'm fine.

794
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,695
My, uh...

795
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:43,336
my first engagement with
the enemy in Vietnam...

796
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:48,716
...I'd been in country about a week.

797
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,815
It was early May,

798
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:56,735
just before the wet season.

799
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,195
Took command of a platoon
at 50% strength,

800
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:03,025
whose last platoon leader

801
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:06,716
stepped on a land mine the week before.

802
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:13,565
We were in a valley
near the Laotian border,

803
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:16,296
taking fire from a ridgeline.

804
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:21,150
Couldn't just sit there
and get all shot to hell

805
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:26,270
waiting for the air support, so...

806
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:30,610
I sent a squad up to flank 'em,

807
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:34,751
even though I knew they were
probably ready for that.

808
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:38,020
They were.

809
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,070
Somehow or other,

810
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,770
we took the damn ridge,

811
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:46,270
not that it mattered much in the end.

812
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:50,230
I lost three men that day.

813
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:53,310
Kids, really, looking back on it.

814
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:56,371
Hell, so was I.

815
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:59,480
Afterwards, we were
waiting for the Hueys,

816
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:03,520
and I was standing next to the bodies,

817
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:08,150
wrapped in their ponchos in the mud.

818
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:11,150
And all of a sudden,

819
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:16,440
the sky just split open
and it started to rain.

820
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:19,730
Hardest rain I'd ever seen.

821
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:23,270
And I remember thinking,

822
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:25,980
I'm going to have to find a dry place

823
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:28,871
to write these boys' parents.

824
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:33,940
Later on, our company commander

825
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:35,610
put me up for a medal.

826
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:39,360
And I said, "Sir, I don't
believe I deserve one."

827
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:42,190
And he said, "Son...

828
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:45,440
"the medal isn't for what you did.

829
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:47,961
It's for living with it."

830
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,900
That's all we can do, Bess.

831
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,110
Lead as wisely as we can,

832
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,650
and then...

833
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,331
carry the weight of it as best we can.

834
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:19,371
I-I wonder...

835
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,570
...if that's how
General Doroshevich feels

836
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:25,310
about his medals.

837
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:28,190
I think it's worth trying to find out.

838
00:36:28,191 --> 00:36:30,690
DALTON: <i>Mr. President, General.</i>

839
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,520
As we speak, your heroic cosmonauts

840
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:36,610
are engaging in a record
number of space walks

841
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,360
to provide their American comrades

842
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:41,400
with the space suits they
need to save their lives.

843
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:46,440
Their heroism is an inspiration
to the entire world.

844
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:48,810
Can we not follow their example

845
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,424
and put aside our differences

846
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,883
for the greater good?

847
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:53,269
ELIZABETH: We want to urge you

848
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,928
to reconsider our offer, Mr. President,

849
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:57,348
and preserve the peace

850
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,768
that so many have lost
their lives trying to secure,

851
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,268
including President Ostrova...

852
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:04,968
Your words are most inspirational.

853
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:08,058
Regrettably they will not bring
back our murdered president.

854
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,348
We have nothing further to discuss.

855
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,018
General, Mr. President.

856
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:15,728
While we have no wish
for further conflict,

857
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:18,018
we are prepared for it if necessary.

858
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:22,308
But I'm getting tired of sending
good people to their deaths.

859
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,098
Aren't you?

860
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:26,228
I fail to see...

861
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:28,199
Indeed I am, Mr. President.

862
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,468
And so are my people.

863
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:35,369
Then let's talk peace.

864
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,239
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

865
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,098
Hey. I got your text.

866
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,678
What's up?

867
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,058
Well, thought you should know,
uh, we're just getting word now

868
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,199
that the peace deal is
going to stick after all.

869
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:52,518
(sighs)

870
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,768
That's good news.

871
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,058
It's great news.

872
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:56,348
What are you drinking, Professor?

873
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:58,058
Uh, no, I'm okay. Thanks.

874
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,348
PERRY: Come on, man, loosen up.

875
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:00,901
The four of us in this
room had as much to do

876
00:38:00,902 --> 00:38:03,021
with the Russians throwing
in the towel as anyone.

877
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:05,461
Anyone except the kid who's not here.

878
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:08,230
FELLOWS: You flew combat
sorties in the Gulf War.

879
00:38:08,231 --> 00:38:10,443
- This can't all be new to you.
- The difference is

880
00:38:10,444 --> 00:38:11,980
I never looked anybody in the eye

881
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:13,020
and promised them they'd be okay,

882
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:14,671
and then dropped a bomb on them.

883
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:18,291
It was a very unusual circumstance.

884
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,110
So everybody keeps telling me.

885
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:24,921
Look, you're a really
great handler, Henry.

886
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:28,041
We could not have done it without you.

887
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:31,211
But now that it is done...

888
00:38:31,212 --> 00:38:32,921
so am I.

889
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:34,791
I quit.

890
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,131
(wry chuckle)

891
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:38,207
Yeah, it's a little more
complicated than that.

892
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,617
Actually, it's not.
It's amazingly simple.

893
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,657
But hey, if you want
to drink, let's drink.

894
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:47,367
Here's to Captain Dmitri Petrov.

895
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:50,037
And to paraphrase
our greatest president,

896
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:52,997
"The world will little
note nor long remember

897
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,308
what we say here, but it can
never forget what he did here."

898
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:01,308
May he rest in peace.

899
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:08,868
NEWSWOMAN: Russian cosmonauts
undertook an amazing

900
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:10,741
nine consecutive space walks

901
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:13,288
to save their American
and Japanese colleagues

902
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,127
aboard the International Space Station.

903
00:39:15,128 --> 00:39:16,258
We did it.

904
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:18,244
Well, actually, the secretary did it.

905
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:19,265
No, they did it.

906
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:20,284
No, I mean...

907
00:39:20,285 --> 00:39:21,914
we all did it.

908
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:24,994
Russia, China and the U.S.?

909
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,704
I mean, how often does that happen?

910
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:28,074
Cheers.

911
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:28,745
Cheers.

912
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:29,414
Cheers.

913
00:39:29,415 --> 00:39:30,664
GLENN: <i>You got to admit,</i>

914
00:39:30,665 --> 00:39:33,574
we make a pretty good team.

915
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:35,475
We do.

916
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:38,414
So... lunch?

917
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,874
(sighs)

918
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,200
The rescue reportedly
required a great deal

919
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:44,914
- Hey, girls.
- of high-level diplomacy here on Earth,

920
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,374
as American and Russian
officials struggled

921
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,784
to find a way forward

922
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:51,204
against the backdrop of
the conflict in Ukraine.

923
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:54,244
There's good news tonight
on that front as well.

924
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:55,954
With a statement from the White House

925
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:57,664
asserting that the broad outlines

926
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,954
of a cease-fire have been...

927
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:01,287
- (turns off TV)
- The White House called.

928
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:03,954
They're of the opinion we
shouldn't pursue Bozek,

929
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:06,914
Melnik or any of their
cohorts further for the hack

930
00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:08,204
of Air Force One.

931
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,454
They feel Ukraine will fracture

932
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:12,494
without Bozek and his
government in power,

933
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:15,784
which would be dangerous
for the peace deal.

934
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:17,515
They want to know if you agree.

935
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:21,935
Sure. Why not?

936
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:25,074
In Russia...

937
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:26,624
(sighs)

938
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,164
...they're selling this peace deal

939
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:33,595
like it was Maria
Ostrov's greatest wish.

940
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:40,244
Like she was the Mother
Teresa of Moscow.

941
00:40:40,245 --> 00:40:41,784
Can you believe that?

942
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:43,914
(sighs heavily)

943
00:40:43,915 --> 00:40:47,164
Peace is a beautiful thing, Blake.

944
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:49,534
Making peace...

945
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,385
not so much.

946
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:54,494
Night.

947
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,345
Good night, ma'am.

948
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:02,704
NEWSWOMAN: <i>The crew,
seen here in a portion</i>

949
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:04,877
- of the space station called Unity Node,
- ELIZABETH: Hey, guys.

950
00:41:04,878 --> 01:22:09,752
- can now begin crucial...
- Hi.

951
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:05,665
Hey.

952
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:06,454
Hi.

953
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:07,560
(turns off TV)

954
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:08,664
This space station stuff

955
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:10,074
is unbelievable.

956
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:11,624
It's like a miracle.

957
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,034
Okay, no, the miracle was Dad

958
00:41:14,035 --> 00:41:16,494
staying an extra two hours
at the Winter Carnival.

959
00:41:16,495 --> 00:41:19,074
He was cleaning and
kissing up to Dean Ward.

960
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,140
Hi.

961
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,204
Wow. Really?

962
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:22,914
I'm pretty sure I'm a student for life.

963
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:24,417
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Which, for the record,

964
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,034
means more volunteering, guys.

965
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:27,874
Well, I love it, so...

966
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:28,580
Hey.

967
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:29,385
Ah.

968
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,305
You want to go for a walk?

969
00:41:34,165 --> 00:41:36,624
So, how was your day?

970
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,454
Eh, uneventful.

971
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,164
The good news is, I
think we finally have

972
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:44,994
someone in Russia that
we can do business with.

973
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:48,124
So that's worth something.

974
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:50,385
That's worth a lot.

975
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,204
I quit my job today.

976
00:41:58,205 --> 00:41:59,994
Not my-my job job.

977
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,494
My other job.

978
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:03,454
I guess I just needed some time

979
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:07,624
to process... well, everything.

980
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,994
If that's what you want, good.

981
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,244
And just to be 100% clear,

982
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:15,074
we do not need to be
talking to lawyers.

983
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,555
You're not getting rid of me that easy.

984
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,244
You're a good person, Elizabeth.

985
00:42:21,245 --> 00:42:22,954
I know you tried your best.

986
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:24,334
So did I.

987
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:27,074
But people still got hurt.

988
00:42:27,075 --> 00:42:29,175
Yeah.

989
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,414
Maybe that should be my epitaph.

990
00:42:34,415 --> 00:42:36,414
"She tried her best,

991
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,414
but people still got hurt."

992
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:43,534
Not "She liked eating popcorn
at really weird times"?

993
00:42:43,535 --> 00:42:46,334
Okay, if I die first, I
want to make it that.

994
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,845
Be... make sure that it's that.

995
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:54,413
So now what?

996
00:42:54,414 --> 00:42:57,223
We just keep trying our best.
