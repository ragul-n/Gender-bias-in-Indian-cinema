1
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,417
Police station how far?

2
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:43,583
...Two kilometres. Two kilometres.
Ok -

3
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,625
Listen Chinu
Yes, tell me

4
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,083
Can you hear me?

5
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,125
Tyre has a puncture.

6
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,458
So I’m walking to the
police station.

7
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,375
Yes. Walking.

8
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:56,917
What are you saying?

9
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:59,833
Wait, wait.

10
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:04,875
Saying I’m walking to the
police station.

11
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,542
Do something,

12
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,208
tell your sister in law…

13
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,333
What's your problem?

14
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,958
…no..no..no..

15
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,083
Not feeling like talking to her.

16
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,708
Besides told you,
not me.

17
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,125
All right, calling

18
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,625
Yes, getting there.

19
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,708
OK. Tell Ma not to be tense.

20
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,583
OK, hanging up.

21
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,833
Anyone else with
that Madam!

22
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,125
Her mother?

23
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,958
The things he says!

24
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,958
What rubbish!

25
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,625
Their son,

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,583
can anyone –

27
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,333
...he’s the father Ma,
how can he do this.

28
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:49,333
All right.
Staying calm.

29
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,042
Yes, Chayan phoned.
Yes

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,417
Yes

31
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,333
He's come

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,250
Hanging up

33
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes returned from
Calcutta today.

34
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:19,750
Was waiting.

35
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,833
All the friends he went to,
everywhere.

36
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:28,833
Went with him?

37
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,792
Yes... why?

38
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,125
Saying when my son
wandered the hill tracks...

39
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,250
...did you go with him?

40
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,583
Saw where he slipped?

41
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,833
Did you?

42
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,250
No.

43
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,208
Then how do you know
where to find my son?

44
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:50,042
Sometimes Abdul went

45
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,625
Abdul went.

46
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,542
Does Abdul know my son had
breathing trouble?

47
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,542
Does he know my son had
costochondritis?

48
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,208
That if he cried or was anxious,
had chest congestion?

49
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,958
Abdul knows he couldn’t
sleep without me?

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,375
Please don’t make a scene.

51
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,333
Not your home,
a police station.

52
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,125
You don’t get it!

53
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,000
I don’t get it but
the point is,

54
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,417
did you?

55
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:26,333
Could you have held
our son back?

56
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,750
Boss calling you.
Come inside.

57
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,833
It’s raining, heavy fog,

58
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,833
no one wants to go
into the gorge.

59
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,375
Nothing possible till 8 tomorrow.

60
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,833
Not possible!

61
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,333
What do you mean?

62
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,750
My son lying somewhere
head split open!

63
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,042
You ask me to wait
till sunrise?

64
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,625
Please Dr Chatterjee
try to understand

65
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,375
Told you over and over.
Not to high altitudes!

66
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,167
Has breathing trouble,
vertigo.

67
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,833
Bobby’s my son too Ayan.

68
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,125
So what?

69
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,292
Couldn’t stop him.
Got lost.

70
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,250
Dr Chatterjee

71
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,625
Mrs Chatterjee

72
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,542
Roy

73
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,000
Aditi Roy

74
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,292
Spoken to his friends?

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,708
Last saw Bobby in the field.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,875
Was very upset.

77
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,542
Didn’t want to talk

78
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,917
Let’s have a bet?

79
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:26,667
On what?

80
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,417
Tonight’s match.

81
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,125
Manu or Chelsea.
Who’s going to win?

82
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,250
Don’t watch football any more.

83
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:34,667
Why?

84
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,792
Go to bed early.

85
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,167
Ma gets annoyed.

86
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,542
Say we’ll watch it in bed.
Then sleep.

87
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,375
Ma cries every night.

88
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:49,708
Can’t if I stay awake.

89
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,000
No warm clothes?

90
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,833
Forgot. No time.

91
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,208
Take this.

92
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,042
Don’t drink at night anymore?

93
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,708
It's your mother you know

94
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,625
Wow, you’ve started again

95
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,875
Started – you started it.

96
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,708
Your mother’s responsible.

97
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,042
Won’t like hearing it but
can’t be helped.

98
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,125
Couldn’t live with her own husband

99
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,333
– now doing it to her daughter.

100
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,125
What will she eat in
her old age?

101
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,625
Has to live off her daughter.
- Ayan please stop it.

102
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:43,667
Stop what?

103
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,417
Won’t talk about
money to my mother.

104
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,250
Do it with my earnings.

105
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:50,625
Don’t talk so much.

106
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,583
Chasing another girl

107
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,208
That’s it! Out, out!
- What?

108
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,375
Go. Listen...

109
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:56,500
Ayan won’t create a scene...

110
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,125
Pick someone else…

111
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,958
Pick someone.
-  Ayan won’t create a scene

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,667
Choose your mother or me

113
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,792
Don’t make a scene

114
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,833
Go, go, go, go
- Meaning? Go?

115
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,500
Out, out, out, out
- Oh…

116
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,083
Tell me…

117
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,792
...No, no...

118
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,833
…no…
they can’t do anything

119
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,792
We are now going
to Bobby's friends

120
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,875
Ayan’s lying.

121
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,667
They had a fight today.

122
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:39,958
Over tiffin Ayan and Bobby,
over Auntie.

123
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,542
Sourav’s the best.

124
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,958
You know. His records?

125
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,417
No one in Europe or America
watches cricket

126
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,750
I like cricket.

127
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:51,833
Know what a big batsman
my dad was?

128
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,083
Sourav’s classmate.

129
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,000
Stop talking like a
typical Bong.

130
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,583
Your father Sourav’s friend?

131
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,250
Want me to believe that?

132
00:08:58,292 --> 00:08:59,708
Believe it or not,

133
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,000
it’s true.

134
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,917
Went with Sourav to the
puja in Barisha too...

135
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,000
...and beat drums together.

136
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,083
What? Don’t believe it?

137
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,625
I’ve seen my dad talk to
Sourav Ganguly.

138
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,208
Oh really! When?

139
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,583
In Kolkata

140
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,833
Our team had a match
against Sourav’s.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,250
Final day of the tournament.

142
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,042
Shook hands with my dad.

143
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,292
Have their photo at home.

144
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,375
Show me the picture bro

145
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,417
In our Kolkata home.

146
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,042
When Ma goes next will
bring it.

147
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,167
Auntie’s in Kolkata now.

148
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,042
Yes, bank work

149
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,083
You alone at home?

150
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,542
No, no.

151
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:43,042
Uncle Abdul and Kusti Didi
are there.

152
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,125
Ma will be back tonight.

153
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,125
Your mother didn’t take you
to Kolkata?

154
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,125
No gone on work.

155
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,667
Needs to meet dad.

156
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,750
Next time she’ll take me,

157
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,667
I’ll bring that photo

158
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,708
How will you?

159
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,958
She’s gone to Kolkata
to get a divorce.

160
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,417
Divorced yesterday in court.

161
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,167
Won’t let you into that
Kolkata house.

162
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:07,833
How do you know?

163
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,500
Ma was telling Dad.

164
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,583
Auntie rang wanting the
principal’s number.

165
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,167
Didn’t tell you?

166
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,417
Your Dad won’t come
here anymore.

167
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,292
They’re planning to send
him to a boarding school

168
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,833
You’re lying

169
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,333
Why should I lie?

170
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,333
Those whose parents divorce...

171
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,375
...have to go to
boarding school.

172
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,292
Everyone knows

173
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,583
Won’t go to boarding school.

174
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,708
Won’t go

175
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,292
Hey…listen...

176
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,500
Ma

177
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,667
What?

178
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,042
Nothing

179
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,958
What nothing?
Don’t be like your dad.

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,375
Have to ask you ten times.

181
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,292
What’s wrong?

182
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,083
Ma

183
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,750
What’s happened to Grand?

184
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,292
When?

185
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,958
At the station –

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,375
hugged me wiped
his eyes on my back

187
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:25,250
Won’t see you for
a long time.

188
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:27,875
Enough to hurt a grandfather

189
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,333
How many days?

190
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,833
Ma

191
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:42,625
Can’t you give up
the bank job?

192
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,792
No.

193
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,250
Why?

194
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,917
When you father went to seminars in
London, New York and Tokyo.

195
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,958
did I tell him to
give up medicine?

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,583
Isn’t my job important?

197
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,500
Bobby,

198
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:13,500
if you want to go stay
with your father...

199
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,167
...I won’t stop you.

200
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,167
Can’t stay without you!

201
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,667
Dad, Ma and I are fine.

202
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,375
Darjeeling is nice,

203
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,375
but it’s so foggy every day.
can’t see a thing!

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,625
Dad you get good tea here.

205
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,750
Come with Bhanu.

206
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:40,250
Tell  Grand to write to me.

207
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,667
What are Uncle and Aunty doing?

208
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,542
Hope my fish are well.

209
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:49,208
Tell Kartik Uncle to turn on
the aquarium heater at night.

210
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,667
They will catch cold.

211
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,917
Dad it’s always cold here

212
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,958
Ma puts a hot water bottle
under the quilt at night.

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,042
At my feet.

214
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,167
Keep them warm.

215
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:07,083
Here the hills,
even the trees are very serious

216
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,833
Dad send me some
money please

217
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,500
– everyone has pocket
money in school.

218
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,500
Needed for snacks or
buying balls.

219
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,417
Be kind to Bhanu
don't scold him

220
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,000
If you can send him here.

221
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,333
Hanging up now.

222
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,917
You, boy!

223
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,083
No sense of shame?

224
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,417
Begging your Dad
for money!

225
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:29,500
What do you think?

226
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,458
I don’t give you money?

227
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,417
Beggar!

228
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,750
Don’t give you anything?

229
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,542
You...asked your father.

230
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,792
Get out of here!

231
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,042
Power goes here twice a day.

232
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,500
Morning and evening.

233
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,542
Not uncomfortable?

234
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,000
Used to it.

235
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,958
Good in one way.

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,250
Bobby watches less TV

237
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Draws well

238
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,875
You teach him?

239
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,958
Sings well too.

240
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,458
like you

241
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,583
Coming here his habits...

242
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:26,583
What was he wearing when
he left the house?

243
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,875
Huh?

244
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:33,375
Meaning the police
will ask, so...

245
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,125
Why?

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,250
Will have to look in the
nearby hospitals.

247
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,792
You don’t have to, I will.

248
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,625
Nothing’s happened to Bobby.

249
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,083
Somewhere around.

250
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,958
Nothing’s wrong.
We’ll find him, you see!

251
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,167
There is no we

252
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,875
Let’s see

253
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,333
I’ll go to the hospitals

254
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,208
I’ll go with you

255
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,583
No you won’t

256
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:12,458
Don’t feel like talking to you.

257
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:16,708
Please tell me what he was
wearing when he left.

258
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,125
Uniform
- Huh?

259
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,208
School uniform.

260
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,458
This is my diary.

261
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,708
No one’s to read it.

262
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,083
My name is Mr Ritabrata Chatterjee

263
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:53,167
Address 165A Babubazar Street.
Umanath House, Uttarpara, Hooghly

264
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,583
I’m called Bobby.

265
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,208
Now I live with
my mother in Darjeeling.

266
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,958
Darjeeling is nice.

267
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,958
But there are no
railings by the cliffs.

268
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,458
You can ride horses
on the roads.

269
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,417
Everyone speaks in
Hindi or their own language.

270
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,417
Our actual home is in Uttarpara.

271
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,083
We all live there.

272
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,125
Our house is very famous...

273
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,458
Whether it’s because of Dad
or  Grand I don’t know,

274
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,875
but at the five point crossing
say NebuBabu’s house and...

275
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,875
... everyone will show you.

276
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,833
Beneath our house in front is
the medicine shop.

277
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,625
Uncle and Hanif Uncle
run the shop together.

278
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:33,417
That’s the father of fat Pupai
from next door, Uncle Bulu

279
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,625
Here catch.

280
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,875
Catch any of my fingers

281
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,875
Should have been
called fool you not Bulu.

282
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,083
Tricks medicine from Uncle.

283
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,542
Didn’t happen

284
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,042
Hanif,

285
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,208
2 strips of my pressure
medicine.

286
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,208
What happened?

287
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,667
Tell me a number between
123 and 222

288
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,667
102

289
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes, money number

290
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,458
Get money?

291
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,875
How would you get money?

292
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:08,625
Why?

293
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:12,625
Where does 102 fit between
123 and 222?

294
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,917
Oof!

295
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,792
163

296
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,042
163...

297
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:23,667
6 and 1... 7 and 3...10.
Nope, no money today

298
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,708
What’s mine then?

299
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,875
What to say?

300
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,458
8th day jinx.

301
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,750
No.

302
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,083
Crack 12 coconuts

303
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,167
12...

304
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,250
Want money for free but
won’t spend any?

305
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,625
12 coconuts – how much?

306
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:46,167
Say 20 rupees per coconut.
12 into 20,

307
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,625
240.And 63 for prayers.

308
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,875
Adds up to...
- 303

309
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,542
Yes. Subtract 163

310
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,458
Why?

311
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,917
Didn’t I buy medicine?

312
00:18:58,917 --> 00:18:59,875
140

313
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,583
Yes, 150 rupees

314
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,375
Rs.10 for the bus

315
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:14,708
You got the whole property

316
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,083
...see you

317
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,417
Thank god, thank god

318
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,208
Money god,
give me money.

319
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,125
Saw anything?

320
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,708
Your money and medicine –
took both

321
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,667
Shut up.

322
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,875
Father mustn’t know.

323
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:32,250
Miserly old man –
never spends.

324
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:34,292
The shop will shut down
after this.

325
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,667
This is  Grand's and
Granny’s room

326
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,250
Grand had a dispensary

327
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,083
But if I had tummy ache
or fever,

328
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,292
Granny would feel my pulse
and give me medicine.

329
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,542
Then...no school!

330
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,792
Hmm,

331
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,292
my old darling isn’t
well at all.

332
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,667
Can’t send him to school

333
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,083
Kartik
- Yes sir

334
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,417
Get a Calpol from the shop
and give it to him

335
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,917
Doesn’t have fever

336
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,625
Who’s the doctor?
Me or you?

337
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,083
You

338
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:08,833
Calpol

339
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,208
My god

340
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,167
What’s wrong with the boy?

341
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,292
Just what I feared.

342
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,292
Uncle Bulu’s wife.
From next door.

343
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,750
Stays in our home most
of the time.

344
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,792
In Grand and Granny’s
room...

345
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,917
..always lands up

346
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,500
To chop spice.

347
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,500
Drives us mad

348
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,000
Head and tummy ache from
the morning.

349
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,833
Can’t get up.

350
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:38,250
Isn’t there a maths test in
school today?

351
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,750
Old darling,
then what?

352
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,375
Block test.
Not much

353
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,500
Not much?
Really?

354
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,583
Isn’t there a maths test
in school today?

355
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,042
What’s that got to
do with you?

356
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,417
Pupai’s been mugging
numbers all morning,

357
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,958
Will still get 13

358
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,833
No, no can’t bunk today.
Has to go to school

359
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,750
Oh! Told his mother to leave.

360
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:08,167
Takes time getting him ready –

361
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,792
and who will drop him?

362
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,583
Why tell Manu –

363
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,833
he’ll take our Pupai too.

364
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,958
After the exam he’ll take a
break and fetch them.

365
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,042
Uncle here can send a slip.

366
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,375
That’s good.

367
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,417
Come on

368
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,500
Get ready!

369
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:24,500
Oh!

370
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,167
Today we’re cooking
hilsa curry!

371
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,833
hilsa?

372
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,917
Right to give it to him?

373
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,125
Listen…

374
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,125
With a stomach ache!
Hilsa, impossible!

375
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:40,250
He’ll go hungry to school

376
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,667
Why? I’ll send him some
stew with Kartik

377
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,667
Our Pupai can have the hilsa

378
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,792
That’s best

379
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,583
See you

380
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,500
Kartik...

381
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,042
Managed the fish.

382
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,167
Now go.

383
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:57,042
If only I’d smelt hilsa before!

384
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,042
The most amusing place
in our house.

385
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,750
Dad says we play
musical chairs here.

386
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,208
That’s not a chair –
chair’s inside.

387
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,958
Bathroom.

388
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,792
Line starts from 8:30
in the morning.

389
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:14,500
Not 3 bathrooms,
just 1.

390
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,667
A commode and
an old fashioned squat.

391
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,792
Think  Greatgrand has the
commode now.

392
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,583
Go to the one on the left
and stop fussing!

393
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,958
Problem.
I’m an artist.

394
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,125
Have some quirks.

395
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:32,167
Say right I go left.
Yes, yes

396
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,583
Telling you before you
ruin your pyjamas

397
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,375
Artists have something else.

398
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,208
If nothing,

399
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,000
control

400
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,417
There, there,

401
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:44,250
still there?

402
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:45,667
Why not?

403
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,458
You’re there.
What does he do?

404
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,042
Stays with me.

405
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,333
I keep it

406
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,708
What do you mean?
All finished!

407
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,833
What’s this about?

408
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:54,833
Spider

409
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:55,583
Beedi

410
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,292
Rubbish!

411
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,125
Why should I talk beedis
with you?...

412
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,208
Go sweep the spider out!
Go!

413
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,125
Is he mad?

414
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:08,417
Had a bath not going
to touch it!

415
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,583
Just shut your mouth.

416
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:15,375
Servant talking like that!

417
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:18,958
I’ll tell Ma you sit in the
bathroom alone...

418
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,083
Doing what?

419
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,125
Smoking

420
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,875
I’ll tell her too.

421
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:28,042
You’ve got four lakhs -

422
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,542
You’re my brother.

423
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:31,750
My own brother.

424
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:35,000
Can you do something
like that?

425
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,792
My Great Grand in the garden.

426
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,292
Grand’s mother was
from Bangladesh.

427
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,042
Great Grand speaks like her

428
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,667
Scared the bejeezus out
of me shit.

429
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,667
Can’t get up early?

430
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,458
Your age I’d crap like a river.

431
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:56,375
Grand

432
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:56,958
What?

433
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,958
Paper.

434
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:58,958
Crapper?

435
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,667
Not crapper – paper

436
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,167
Need it to crap,
so crapper

437
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,833
Give me the 3rd page.

438
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:09,167
News of a cinema premiere there.

439
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,917
Come on

440
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,250
What happened?

441
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,500
School

442
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,167
Lies! All lies!

443
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,250
Go, spider won't touch you

444
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:25,250
Spider can't touch me
have my mother's blessing

445
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,833
What happened?

446
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:30,417
Give you the remaining
dialogue later.

447
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,333
Open wide

448
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,250
Stomach upset?

449
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:39,500
Eat up

450
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,625
Have an exam today?

451
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,083
What, Dada?

452
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,458
You eat quietly

453
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,458
Kartik

454
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,667
Hey Kartik

455
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,625
Darling boy, eat something
- no.

456
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:55,792
Tummy not aching?

457
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,292
Better

458
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,208
You won't have hilsa?

459
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,125
No, you eat it

460
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:05,625
Here, here, take this

461
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,667
Where were you?

462
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,958
Since when poor thing
chewing raw gourd

463
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,417
What do you do?

464
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,625
Don’t you know?

465
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,667
Runs by the clock

466
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,500
Dada
- Huh?

467
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:19,750
Was the gourd good?

468
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,625
Ate them in the village

469
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,333
Came from uncle’s farm

470
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,333
Ganges gourds

471
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,542
Aunt would stuff them

472
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:33,250
So smooth and slick with oil

473
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,042
Sleeping on the plate they were.

474
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,458
Twinkling at me

475
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,833
Where will you get those?

476
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,250
May not be like
your aunt’s but...

477
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:50,958
...my stuffing’s not bad

478
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:55,333
But then don’t even taste them

479
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,042
Don’t like ours…

480
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,417
You ate raw eggs and
raw vegetables

481
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:04,167
That was exactly right

482
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:09,042
You went and became
the head of our house

483
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,458
If you don’t eat…

484
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,833
Then how can we eat?

485
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:19,125
Won’t stop till ye stuff me
with spice and kill me

486
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,500
One thing…

487
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,958
Will complete a century

488
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,750
This property of mine’s
great property

489
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:29,458
While I’m around, this
house can’t be sold

490
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,958
Things you say!

491
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,292
After a whole chicken ate a
kg of mutton and now?

492
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,500
Is that age the same
age as this?

493
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,167
A little chicken doesn’t hurt

494
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:44,542
Killing me with allopathy

495
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,917
Won’t happen

496
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,167
This is my house

497
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,750
Yes that gold wristwatch
is mine.

498
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,125
Father left it to me.

499
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,583
What said ye
- Nothing, nothing

500
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:57,417
Why mumble to yourself
so loudly then?

501
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,417
Huh

502
00:26:58,458 --> 00:26:59,833
Hear everything

503
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:00,792
Grand

504
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:03,000
Didn’t happen.

505
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:05,000
Do the exam well

506
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,708
What?
- Revise everything

507
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,125
And the rough work
do it well

508
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:11,750
Ketu
- Yes

509
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,875
This thing pour the
gravy into my mouth

510
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:16,042
Yes, yes, here

511
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,167
Open wide

512
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,292
Huh!

513
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:21,542
Go

514
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:24,625
Wash up and touch
everyone’s feet

515
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,958
Not for Block Tests

516
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,125
Whatever test.

517
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,375
Still an exam.
So you will touch their feet.

518
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:31,292
Go

519
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,167
Still not done?

520
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:37,250
Done. Calling Uncle Nu,
wait!

521
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:38,250
Granny

522
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:41,292
The hilsa curry was yummy!

523
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,583
Had half.
Left half for Ma

524
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,458
Why half?

525
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,917
Sending two more pieces

526
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:54,042
Yes, whole family will eat it.

527
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:58,375
If they don’t have tummy upsets,
my name’s not Bobby.

528
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,042
May I come in sir?

529
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
I?

530
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:23,125
If it’s 2 not I. We

531
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:26,917
Then?

532
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,750
Can we come in sir?

533
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,167
Yes you can but
you may not

534
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,167
Meaning?

535
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,083
Meaning

536
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,833
This is SKG 1

537
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,667
Saibal Kumar Gupta.
Our principal

538
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:38,833
Maths teacher.

539
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,500
Greatgrand’s student.

540
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,833
Grand’s friend.

541
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,500
Comes over from
time to time.

542
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:48,792
But can’t remember
anything but maths.

543
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,375
What do you mean?

544
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:51,667
Come here

545
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,000
Why are you late?

546
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,458
Tyre puncture

547
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:08,500
Car?

548
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:15,500
Saw Nanu drop you on the
cycle from the Staff room.

549
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:18,208
Car wouldn’t start

550
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,458
That’s why

551
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:21,958
Let me see your hands

552
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,375
Sit down.

553
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:30,833
Show me yours

554
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,458
What’s this?
Jaundice!

555
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:44,333
No, turmeric

556
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:45,750
Turmeric

557
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,250
Yes,

558
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,917
hilsa!

559
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,583
Eating hilsa before an exam

560
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,375
Yes sir,

561
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:03,708
told her to watch out for bones
get late. Don’t eat

562
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,000
Get late.
Sir will be cross

563
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,417
Said to go with time in hand.

564
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,250
Didn’t listen

565
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:12,375
You sit.

566
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:15,375
You will do the exam standing.

567
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,542
Eating hilsa indeed!

568
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,333
You’re cheering!

569
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:28,625
Don’t want to be a king

570
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,750
Oh oh don’t kill me doctor

571
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:43,500
Oh oh oh, I want to live

572
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,583
Don’t kill me

573
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:47,708
Great!

574
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:50,542
Looking great!

575
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,583
Got that medal?

576
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,750
Money will come and go but...

577
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,458
...these will remain

578
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,542
Yes

579
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:03,458
Saying, my medal.
You won’t give me one?

580
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,042
Keep them all ?

581
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,833
What will you do with medals?

582
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:09,292
Look at them from
time to time

583
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,333
You belong to this family –

584
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,917
already learnt the difference

585
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,625
between mine and ours?

586
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,458
Still can’t tell my
elder brother,

587
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,417
give me that gold watch,

588
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,833
let me try it on…

589
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,333
Can’t say it

590
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,500
Hey and you’ve come to
ask for medals

591
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:31,000
Give him what’s his for
heaven’s sake

592
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:33,292
Wants the medals now,

593
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:37,125
tomorrow it will be the shop.
Day after the third floor.

594
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:38,792
Shame shame!

595
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,000
Are you really my son?

596
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:43,875
No he’ll get dowry
from my father.

597
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:47,167
Don’t pester the poor thing!

598
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:51,000
Poor thing? Him?

599
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,250
Isn’t there a proverb,

600
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:57,625
Look at him,
round like your brother.

601
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,333
Brains of a mule.

602
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:05,500
Papa mere mummy ko
scold mat karo

603
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:06,958
Why speak Hindi?

604
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,792
Keep quiet

605
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,792
I mean

606
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:16,250
Even if I am 15 years younger,

607
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:20,667
I never asked you for anything

608
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:25,083
What's that...in your pocket?

609
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:30,208
No when you rub my chest
with those thick bangles,

610
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,417
my hand automatically
goes to my pocket.

611
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:33,667
How much?

612
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,292
Oh, Nanu

613
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:37,708
Tell your father

614
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:43,083
Meaning…but…if…tea

615
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,125
Rubbish

616
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:50,333
What gibberish!

617
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,458
After all these years you realise
this lump talks gibberish.

618
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,208
Four lakhs

619
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:04,083
Get a chance in a cinema
with four lakhs.

620
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:13,083
Get my son in the cinema
with money?

621
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,667
Have to nowadays.

622
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,583
Four lakhs

623
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,000
Four lakhs

624
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,667
Four!

625
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,500
Get out

626
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,250
Get out

627
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,083
Scoundrel! Get out!

628
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:34,375
Today I have no car,
no bank account,

629
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,750
no bank,
So what do I have?

630
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,792
I have my mother

631
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,083
Don’t worry.

632
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:45,250
I’ll pawn my jewellery and
give you the money.

633
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:48,042
This miser never lets anything
slip through his fingers.

634
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,708
Pawn jewellery?

635
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,125
That’s my mother’s

636
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:51,917
Huh

637
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:56,167
Your father sent you with a chain
and some flimsy bangles.

638
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:02,167
You said that to me?

639
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,375
No point crying over
film pretentions

640
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:09,583
Won’t give that ass
a single coin

641
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,958
Everyone in this house
stands on their own feet

642
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,500
Why should it be
different for him?

643
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:15,583
You…

644
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:17,083
Don’t cry.

645
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:18,542
Very inauspicious.

646
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,458
Now I will drop dead.

647
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Say my death will
be a blessing

648
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:23,708
Shame shame!

649
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,625
Did I say that?

650
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:26,875
Was about to

651
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:30,542
Life and death heavens are
playing, emperor

652
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:34,542
No one can say
when death comes

653
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,750
What did that lump say?

654
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:44,917
Len… lentils

655
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,750
Lentils for Sunday lunch?

656
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,250
Uncle said so

657
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:48,875
Oh

658
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:51,250
Didi sit down please

659
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:52,750
No, you do.

660
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:54,042
I’ll wait for Ma

661
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,125
Then I will too

662
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,000
No, no

663
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,875
Sit down and eat

664
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,833
You can’t bear being hungry

665
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,875
No one can, Ma

666
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,458
Meaning?

667
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,375
No, she was saying...

668
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:10,792
Goes out for a
morning walk,

669
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:14,125
just nibbled at
something…so

670
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:16,917
No lentils for me!

671
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,458
Sunday lunch...

672
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:21,208
Want to dip my fingers
in gravy – and…

673
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,875
Dada says...

674
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:27,833
...after meat easier
to digest

675
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,375
Doctors all of you!

676
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,625
Cheated in the exams
father and son?

677
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:35,458
Bomb won’t get a
doctor out of them

678
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:42,208
Don’t want to live eating raw
eggs and vegetables like you.

679
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,417
At my age its meditation ye
need, meditation.

680
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,208
After meat as if sipping lentils is
going to make it any easier

681
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,167
What did you say?

682
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,417
Telling you!

683
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:02,458
You’re the odd one
out in this house

684
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,375
Oh shut up!

685
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,250
Eats here once…

686
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,667
Why?
Why should I shut up?

687
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,417
Why so you can amuse
people with raw vegetables?

688
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:13,708
Aye.

689
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:19,083
Ye’ll be happy at
my passing car...

690
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,417
...watch – all into
your grasp!

691
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,250
Don’t comprehend is it!

692
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:25,208
That greedy shine in
your eyes.

693
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,792
Your glance.
Know it all!

694
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:28,917
Uncle please,

695
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:32,083
eating together once.
Let it be once

696
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,000
Ma where’s Nanu?

697
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,250
Aye,

698
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,042
where be Nanu?

699
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:40,583
Yes, where’s Nanu?

700
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,833
Won’t eat.

701
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:42,625
Why?

702
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,750
That dog

703
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,792
Ma don’t understand
your problem

704
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,167
Really Ma, a little
dog…you…

705
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,125
By the bog…pond

706
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,875
Looked did ye?
Bog or dog?

707
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,875
Dog, uncle.

708
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,792
Nanu’s brought a puppy

709
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:02,958
Dog

710
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,083
For a pet?

711
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:04,917
Good.

712
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,500
Stroke a dog.
Heart stays fine.

713
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,958
After all,
a puppy

714
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,458
Puppy!

715
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,083
Won’t it grow?

716
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,708
There’s god in the house, Dada

717
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,792
You’re a communist.

718
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,250
Give speeches onstage ye do.

719
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:21,583
Don’t think of God then

720
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,708
You don’t understand.

721
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,875
That dog’s bad luck

722
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:29,125
Will cause trouble

723
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:32,083
Have some stew

724
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,458
Put coconut milk in it

725
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
Just for you.

726
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:40,792
Would eat it if my
aunt made it

727
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:42,750
Meaning?

728
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:47,042
Stew or nectar couldn't tell

729
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:54,875
The meat would slide
down my throat, soft, tender.

730
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:57,375
You can’t cook it.

731
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,292
Remembering your
aunt after 40 years...

732
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,750
...of my wife’s cooking.

733
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,417
Praise wouldn’t hurt.

734
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:09,708
Poor thing works
hard to cook

735
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,083
Ye don’t have to take the
wumman's side

736
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,750
Just every day

737
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,417
Wife’s flatterer

738
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,458
Stop it!

739
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,292
Have some rice?

740
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,167
No

741
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,417
What shall I give you?

742
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,167
Nothing.

743
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:28,625
Here we are eating
together and…

744
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,750
Happens when Nanu’s not here

745
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,000
What?

746
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,708
Food over?

747
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,083
Do something

748
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:38,833
Go call Uncle Nu.

749
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,625
Tell him we’re calling him

750
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,167
Go, go, go!

751
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,208
That dog isn’t
coming into this house.

752
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,958
That’s certain!

753
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,083
Uncle Nu – Uncle Nu

754
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,750
I’m here.
What is it?

755
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,792
What’re you doing here?

756
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,125
What are you doing here?

757
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,917
Mutton downstairs.

758
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,250
Everyone’s calling you

759
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:05,292
It’s Sunday.

760
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,083
Mutton.

761
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,375
Who’s cooked it? Ma?

762
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:08,042
Huh

763
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,917
Say I won’t eat

764
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,792
If you want to keep Bhanu,

765
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,667
can’t do this.

766
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,125
I’ll manage Grand.

767
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,667
Say I’m not hungry

768
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:19,542
Why?

769
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,458
You won’t get it

770
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:26,125
Then why did you get Bhanu
without telling Grand and Granny

771
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,083
Who brought him?

772
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,292
Was returned.

773
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:31,708
Can’t you see the letter and
flowers on the bed?

774
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,417
Who returned him?

775
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:34,792
Idiot!

776
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,083
Do I give anyone anything?
Except Suparna?

777
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,708
As if you don't know!

778
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,750
Why did she return
all that?

779
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,167
Won’t she?

780
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:43,792
Bought them from
the Sunday market.

781
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,125
Cost three thousand.

782
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,667
Lab puppy I thought.

783
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Doctor said it was a cross.

784
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,250
Mongrel.

785
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,625
No speaking

786
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,583
So frustrating

787
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,667
Then return it to the shop...

788
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,167
...get your money back

789
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,500
I did.

790
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,417
Shop was empty.
All gone

791
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:02,625
Has lovely eyes though

792
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,292
My state’s worse than his.

793
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,083
Do something for me.

794
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,708
Do it now.

795
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,083
Can but must promise…

796
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,458
You will eat

797
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,458
Yes,

798
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:15,833
yes,

799
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,583
you can act.

800
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,375
Then come downstairs.

801
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,667
Father and Uncle say they
won’t eat without you

802
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,625
What on earth
happened to them?

803
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,750
Such love for
their brother?

804
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,167
Such passion?

805
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,417
Such affection?

806
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,917
When rain’s blustery

807
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,292
Come study history

808
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,417
But why do I forget it all?

809
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:42,083
That’s the mystery

810
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,500
Very good

811
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,125
My turn now?

812
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,667
Yes, sure

813
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,792
People say I’m very good,

814
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,292
perhaps a little shy

815
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,125
Among my faults
there’s just one

816
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,875
Occasionally I lie

817
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,583
On the way to Ghatshila

818
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,417
When we were
railway borne

819
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:06,167
With Mummy and Daddy,
I was talking up a storm

820
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:09,625
Suddenly saw in the field
all the walking trees

821
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,208
Different scenes unfold,
different dances please

822
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,750
Look at the dance drama

823
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,917
Moment I said it

824
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,417
Ma began to scold

825
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:21,542
You’re getting far too bold

826
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,500
Now what is that zoo’s name

827
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,125
Belongs to my uncle the same

828
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,542
Who lovingly showed me
the lion’s golden mane

829
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,750
Few days later looked at that
stark whitewashed wall

830
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,708
And saw unawares that
image which seemed uncommon tall

831
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,875
Moment I said it to Suranjana
it was all in vain

832
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:44,042
In my house there’s a
lion tied to a chain

833
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,417
Teacher heard and
called me. Said

834
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:50,667
Don’t say that again

835
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,667
So don’t say these things

836
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,625
Try to hold it back

837
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:57,625
But that day my silence
seemed to crack

838
00:41:57,667 --> 00:42:00,750
At the end of the horizon,
illness halted again

839
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,417
Saw it in the autumn clouds

840
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:04,167
Namaste Rabindranath

841
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,875
Very good

842
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,083
Very good

843
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:13,375
Don’t I see you every day?

844
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:14,583
That's nice

845
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,417
Thank you

846
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,458
Can I ask one thing?

847
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,458
The cooking at that place –

848
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,167
is it all good?

849
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,083
Yes,

850
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,042
actually

851
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:24,875
Their own…

852
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,708
Favourite recipes –

853
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,708
so naturally it’s good

854
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,167
Oh

855
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:34,417
You could show the
city people something,

856
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:35,958
Don’t mind…

857
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:40,083
Your episodes are
very rural…

858
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,250
What’s wrong?

859
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,292
Your brother in law

860
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:48,208
Like them educated
town people

861
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,875
Doctor in fact,

862
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:51,667
watch our show

863
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,583
And quite enjoy it

864
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,417
You watch their show?

865
00:42:58,083 --> 00:42:59,917
Your chamber happens

866
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,833
Well actually…

867
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,625
Didn’t tell your wife
about me?

868
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,167
Tell her what?

869
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:09,667
Friend of yours,

870
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,042
quite natural
to tell your wife

871
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,542
Scared perhaps

872
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,875
You’ve got it wrong.

873
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:21,500
Husbands and wives
not talking...

874
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,750
...doesn’t mean secrets

875
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,375
He’s a top gynecologist.

876
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,625
Gets to meet 15
women a day

877
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:35,208
Many are married doesn't
matter to him

878
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,042
Who become friends.

879
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:42,833
To listen to…

880
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,833
Daughter in law…

881
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:47,333
come, come,

882
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:50,917
been frying luchis
for ages..

883
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,333
not done yet?

884
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,417
Want to

885
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:56,750
Daughter in law,
go, see!

886
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,583
You don’t act anymore?

887
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,375
I love your acting

888
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,333
Thank you

889
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:16,625
Not doing anything now?

890
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,542
Of course,

891
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:21,167
Bangles,Vermillion and Ma.

892
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:21,792
Ah!

893
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,667
Seen it.
Standing mother carrying baby.

894
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,708
Still running?

895
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,750
Very much.

896
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,083
Highest TRPs

897
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,708
Asked them to expose me
but I rejected the project

898
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,208
Shut up!

899
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,583
ShibuGrand,
open the door!

900
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,583
Wait, comrade

901
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:53,917
I've been waiting.
Open the door, please

902
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,208
Open

903
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:00,750
What’s up?

904
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:03,333
ShibuGrand,
my absolute favourite.

905
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,917
Most days no one sees him.

906
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:07,917
No, not invisible.

907
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,000
Scientist.

908
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:11,917
Busy with some
wheel invention.

909
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,792
Dying to go to Russia.

910
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:16,917
Don’t know why he
wasn’t allowed to go.

911
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:18,708
So stays in his room
by himself.

912
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,417
I’ve come first

913
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,083
Dad sent a burger

914
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,625
Come in

915
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,750
No one enters
ShibuGrand’s room.

916
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,667
Nor does he go
into anyone’s.

917
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,417
Goes crazy when
he sees wheels.

918
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:38,375
Tugging at cycles.

919
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:39,292
ShibuGrand

920
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:39,833
Ooh

921
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,458
Won’t have the burger?

922
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:43,417
Not hungry, so why?

923
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:46,542
Half the people get
nothing to eat

924
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:49,250
How can people
eat for pleasure?

925
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:52,667
Now in Russia
– would shoot them

926
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:57,125
These are all turning.

927
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:58,917
What do they do?

928
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:09,917
When they turn by themselves
we'll be free from hunger

929
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,708
Meaning?

930
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,042
That’s a long story

931
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:17,083
Take a long time

932
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:21,458
Wait

933
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,500
Here

934
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:47,708
What’s this?

935
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,125
You passed –

936
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,833
your gift

937
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:54,167
Reincarnated.

938
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,583
It’s old

939
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:58,667
Old…

940
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:16,667
Well, now it’s yours.

941
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:22,958
What did the doctor
give you?

942
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:26,625
From today I’m sharing
a room with Uncle Nu

943
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:30,875
Two months later Grand will build
us a new room on the terrace.

944
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,708
A separate room
for everyone?

945
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,833
Could have made 4
bunks in Nanu’s room.

946
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:42,250
Everyone sleeps in
bunks in Russia

947
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:45,083
So that four or six
people can share.

948
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,208
Separate rooms here?

949
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,833
In Russia that bourgeois doctor…

950
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:54,292
...would have been shot.

951
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:12,292
Understood love &
water have stopped

952
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,958
not a drop

953
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,167
Shabu...

954
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:22,625
Leaving me ye wander
the four corners.

955
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:25,833
Don’t recollect me?

956
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,708
Think of me and your
heart cries out.

957
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:38,667
Your words make my
heart cry more today.

958
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:44,750
Won’t keep you in the sun.

959
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:50,708
See tiny gourds
on my tree.

960
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,375
Pick some?

961
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,583
Graa n

962
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,042
Graa n

963
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,625
Oh man

964
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,583
Graa n

965
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:50,083
Grand, grandson,
awesome

966
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:55,625
Kicking the bucket

967
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:57,542
Does that every day

968
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,167
If I can tolerate them raw

969
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:03,958
Really kicked the bucket

970
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,042
What do I do?
So what will I do?

971
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:10,583
Oh God, he is really...

972
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:17,250
What are you saying?

973
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:18,083
Come on!

974
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:32,542
Would grow a pigtail?

975
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:36,208
Great grandfather …

976
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:41,250
Bald head. Pigtail.

977
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:45,375
Am I becoming a
regular Brahmin?

978
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,208
Then let me shave
your head

979
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:52,042
Not mine.

980
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:54,750
Uncle’s

981
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,792
You’re the grandson.

982
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,250
You’ll shave.

983
00:50:58,292 --> 00:50:59,000
Dad!

984
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,167
Won’t shave my head!
Dad!

985
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:07,000
Dad, where’s Dad?

986
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:09,917
Where’s Dad?

987
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:13,417
Where’s Dad?

988
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,417
Dad. Dad

989
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,000
Calling your father?

990
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,083
No, sir

991
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,000
I heard you

992
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:31,542
Sleeping here?

993
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:34,375
Don’t sleep at home?

994
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,625
What happened?

995
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,250
Why were you asleep?

996
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,625
Felt sleepy

997
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,292
Really?

998
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:46,500
What logic

999
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:51,167
So tomorrow you
have a tummy upset,

1000
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,375
you shit in class?

1001
00:51:57,792 --> 00:51:59,000
Come here

1002
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,292
Come with me

1003
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:09,000
What does one say
when sending him out?

1004
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,208
Follow me.

1005
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,333
Stop.

1006
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:25,417
Don’t follow me.

1007
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,667
What do I say when
I send him out?

1008
00:52:35,917 --> 00:52:38,417
Get out, Sir

1009
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:43,042
You animals!

1010
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:45,042
Does one tell the
teacher to get out?

1011
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:48,875
Day after Great Grand
died Dad went to London

1012
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:53,958
& Grand got his medals,
watch & photographs back

1013
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,167
Even a clipping from
movie magazine

1014
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:05,417
the actress was a cousin

1015
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:07,333
So he couldn't marry her

1016
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:11,208
Otherwise he really wanted to

1017
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,833
& the actress also liked him

1018
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,708
But Granny won't agree

1019
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:24,500
All these days outside now
she is in my bedroom

1020
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:34,917
Listen, instead of standing there
ask Chayan to bring a large portrait

1021
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,125
You'll see her the
moment you wake up

1022
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,875
Don't be jealous Dolly

1023
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:44,917
Jelousy won't get you
teeth like that

1024
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,833
Or an innocent smile

1025
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,500
Don't be jealous

1026
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:55,458
Some distant cousin,
never set eyes on her

1027
00:53:57,583 --> 00:54:02,333
Ma, Sutapadi's come

1028
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:03,667
Who?

1029
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:13,000
Sutapadi your Dad's friend...TV

1030
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,542
Sitting room...

1031
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:19,167
..turned it on

1032
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:21,417
What's she doing here?

1033
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,625
Didn't tell her?

1034
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,917
He's gone abroad

1035
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:34,667
Said, I know came
because of sad news

1036
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,125
All right. all right

1037
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:39,375
Give her some tea.
Coming

1038
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,125
Takes so long

1039
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:45,917
Heard that,
why is she here?

1040
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,500
Ayan's friend,
got the news, so came

1041
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:50,750
What's there to fuss?

1042
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:57,125
Once a man is married
should he have girlfriends?

1043
00:54:57,542 --> 00:55:00,458
Rise above all that

1044
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:04,708
See if she can get Nanu on TV

1045
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:11,667
I can't be so generous
& allow that

1046
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:15,667
Can't tolerate this

1047
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:20,333
Ruined his eyes!

1048
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:28,667
Sir, I've sh..sh..sh...

1049
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,583
All your sh...sh...sh...

1050
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,000
What sh... out with it?

1051
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,792
Stop fussing, tell me

1052
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:46,708
Shirts arranged

1053
00:55:47,417 --> 00:55:48,792
Say that

1054
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:49,750
Go away

1055
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:52,917
Can't speak properly...

1056
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:54,042
so everyone ...

1057
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,417
What a stink!

1058
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:02,833
All the men in this house
are the same

1059
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:11,000
Look grave but actually the opposite

1060
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:14,292
When they leave worry
about when they return.

1061
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,542
Hello Aunty

1062
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,792
Father is like that too...

1063
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,333
...wanderer

1064
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:25,708
First I was jealous but later...

1065
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:27,833
This is for you

1066
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:29,708
Came to bring this

1067
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,625
Bayblade Stadium
- Bayblade Stadium!

1068
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:34,375
For me?

1069
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:38,292
I showed this to dad
at the mall

1070
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:42,167
Ma shopped so much
no room in the car

1071
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,542
Thank you

1072
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,292
You're most welcome

1073
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:48,708
How did you know
he wanted that?

1074
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:51,417
Ayan told you

1075
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:58,708
Darling, go tell Kartick
to fry some luchis

1076
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:05,083
Have something to
say to you

1077
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,083
How’s Sutapa

1078
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,500
Suddenly?

1079
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:11,333
Fine

1080
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,292
Just.

1081
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,500
Don’t see her on TV.

1082
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:17,833
So asking

1083
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,958
Yes. Not acting.

1084
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,875
Let me have your phone.

1085
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:26,083
Don’t have any charge

1086
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,083
Here

1087
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,458
Yours is off!

1088
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,833
Didn’t realize?

1089
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:45,583
Off?

1090
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,042
Let me see

1091
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:51,125
Told you to keep
the phone on

1092
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:52,167
Didn’t realize

1093
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:55,542
If someone’s kidnapped
Bobby they could phone us.

1094
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:56,417
Bobby could phone

1095
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:58,958
Sorry, didn’t notice
- What do you mean by sorry?

1096
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:01,542
How can you be
so careless?

1097
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,458
Yes, I’m careless.

1098
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:07,542
You’re right.

1099
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,583
That’s why
I didn’t get it.

1100
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:14,417
Shouldn’t have
brought Bobby here.

1101
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,208
You’re right I’m careless.

1102
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,375
Didn't understand

1103
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,625
I’m so sorry Ayan.

1104
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,833
Really so sorry
for everything.

1105
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:28,542
But apart from
Bobby who do I have?

1106
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:36,542
Look at the diary
he kept a diary.

1107
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,333
See 12th January
2013, Darjeeling.

1108
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:46,083
4th Feb 2013 Darjeeling.

1109
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,625
1st April 2013. Darjeeling.

1110
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:50,583
Darjeeling.Darjeeling.

1111
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:54,083
Writes everything but not
one word about here.

1112
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,458
Everything’s about you.

1113
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,625
Careless of me

1114
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:01,417
Really really sorry.

1115
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:16,042
Said something
about a hospital.

1116
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:19,792
He’s alive isn’t he, Ayan?

1117
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:22,625
He’s alive?
- It's fine

1118
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:24,333
Nothing is wrong

1119
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:28,958
Nothing can happen to Bobby

1120
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,000
Can understand you
are suffering

1121
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,708
Sorry

1122
00:59:54,500 --> 01:00:00,375
Ayan.If Bobby returns,
you take him with you, keep him

1123
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:04,208
Didn’t stay with me.
Went away,

1124
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:17,458
Dad says sadness and stress
aren’t linked to the heart.

1125
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,917
When I’m sad
my heart tightens.

1126
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:25,625
That was my punishment day.

1127
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:27,375
All right
- Fine.

1128
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,375
Do it well.

1129
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,250
With faith,
Now the legs.

1130
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,667
Ah

1131
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,167
Walking for 20 minutes

1132
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,958
Legs are aching.

1133
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,375
Won’t do it anymore.

1134
01:00:39,417 --> 01:00:40,833
Can I go?

1135
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:43,708
Won’t do.

1136
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,667
Let father come…

1137
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:46,958
Speak to him.

1138
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:50,458
In hiding recording voices.
Rascal!

1139
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:52,792
Saying he won’t
do it again

1140
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:55,583
Give it to him
- Flatterer

1141
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,458
– won’t give him the mobile.

1142
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,625
Unnecessary humility.

1143
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,708
Children’s words,

1144
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,458
children’s pains.

1145
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,000
On adults all in vain.

1146
01:01:08,042 --> 01:01:08,542
Oh

1147
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:12,042
My mobile’s flown...

1148
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:14,708
...in his pocket thrown

1149
01:01:15,167 --> 01:01:17,875
What else?
What can I do?

1150
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:20,333
Two brothers let's go

1151
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:27,708
What did you record?
Show me

1152
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,375
You’ve got the mobile

1153
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:33,958
Listen

1154
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:38,500
Can I even keep two
pieces of fish for you?

1155
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:41,333
Yes that Nanu ogre
will eat the lot

1156
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,500
That’s right, an ogre

1157
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:45,083
Slap him

1158
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:47,875
Recorded this last night,
listen.

1159
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,208
My parents

1160
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,292
Listen

1161
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,917
Will take Bobby
with me tomorrow

1162
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,708
Go away with him?

1163
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,250
Go means go.

1164
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:57,583
He’ll live with me.

1165
01:01:57,625 --> 01:01:59,458
Is that hard?

1166
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,333
He’s not going anywhere

1167
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:02,750
Bobby’s going with me.

1168
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:05,333
My son.
Taking him from here tomorrow.

1169
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:07,292
Won't live in this house

1170
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:10,042
Dada, is Aunty
taking you away?

1171
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:27,000
Don’t lie.

1172
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:29,333
Will tell them what you do when
you have a stomach ache

1173
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,708
All right, all right.
Going

1174
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:32,625
Yes…

1175
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:40,292
never seen so many
vegetables before

1176
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:43,583
Never met my eyes

1177
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:46,875
Eating them tonight

1178
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:48,667
Stock up on supplies

1179
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:52,167
How much?
One kg?

1180
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,625
Gourd 25

1181
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:54,500
Ahh…

1182
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:56,292
Sweet potato…
- Ah

1183
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,708
12 rupees a kilo

1184
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,083
Jyoti Rs 8

1185
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:03,292
Give 2 kilos
- Will do

1186
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:04,833
You…
- Aww

1187
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:06,500
Give me 20 rupees.

1188
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:10,042
That money you’ve kept for samosas.
Give it

1189
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:11,958
Why why why?

1190
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,042
Hmm

1191
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:16,042
Quickly,
let me have it

1192
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:17,958
Here

1193
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,042
How much is it?

1194
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:22,375
16

1195
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,417
Do something Shibu,

1196
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,417
give me 24 rupees

1197
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,042
Ah

1198
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:30,042
Give me 24 rupees

1199
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:33,125
Please, please

1200
01:03:34,417 --> 01:03:36,875
How did it become 100?

1201
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:39,000
60 rupees due

1202
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:40,333
Will pay it altogether.

1203
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:41,625
I’m off!

1204
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,542
Thief!

1205
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:48,292
Hardened thief.

1206
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,208
Scraped the bowl and
took it whole

1207
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,000
Took potatoes and money

1208
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:56,000
Come on.

1209
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:57,250
Weep humbly

1210
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:16,958
This is my teacher’s reward.

1211
01:04:21,542 --> 01:04:30,750
In whose good wishes I
found harmony

1212
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:35,000
What’s going on?

1213
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,292
Sir, open the door,
meaning…

1214
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,792
Who else is coming?

1215
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,625
Why, sir. Your daughter?

1216
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,000
In Bangalore

1217
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,083
Does she remember?

1218
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:45,792
Sir, you know everything, sir.

1219
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:48,625
My uncle…elder uncle..

1220
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:50,625
Sri Priyabrata Chatterjee

1221
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:51,917
He’s no more.

1222
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:56,292
Last rites on Friday and
dining Saturday,

1223
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,792
Father said you must come.

1224
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:01,125
Oh, then come in

1225
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:03,958
No, sir. I…You’re well?

1226
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:07,542
Why should I be unwell?

1227
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,292
I mean..

1228
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:10,792
Is your father well?

1229
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:12,208
Fine

1230
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,125
Was he supposed to
be not fine?

1231
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:16,833
No, meaning...

1232
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:20,042
sir..Bobby, sir.
How’s he doing in class?

1233
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,792
Your son,
just like you

1234
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,250
Total ass!

1235
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:26,792
Not my son,
my brother's son

1236
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:28,208
Haven’t married yet…

1237
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,042
…your daughter knows
I’m single, sir

1238
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,667
Said his father’s name
was Chayan

1239
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,292
Not Chayan, sir. Ayan

1240
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,042
Yes

1241
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,333
And you’re Shanu…

1242
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:40,458
You sing

1243
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,958
Not Shanu. Nanu

1244
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,750
What Nu?

1245
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:44,375
Nanu,

1246
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:47,208
sir. I’m in acting. Actor.

1247
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,417
Means you do nothing.

1248
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,792
Eat at home chase flies

1249
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:52,708
And Priyabrata,

1250
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,417
Not Priyabrata. I’m Ritabrata

1251
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,833
Priyabrata’s my great uncle.

1252
01:05:57,875 --> 01:05:59,167
I’m Bobby.

1253
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:01,083
Back Chat!

1254
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,917
Your grandfather and
I wore shorts together

1255
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:07,375
He’s short stuff, in jeans tough
...meaning, sir

1256
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:09,458
Out! Get out!

1257
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,542
Going this way, sir,
not that…

1258
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,458
You’ll go the way I say.

1259
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,833
He’ll go straight. Go!

1260
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:17,333
What a mess,

1261
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:21,167
not one job completed!

1262
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:26,542
Give me the key sir,
don't lock it

1263
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:58,042
Hey

1264
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:03,208
What road is this?

1265
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,417
Road to your home

1266
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:10,583
From time to time between husband
and wife something happens.

1267
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,292
In every home

1268
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:14,250
And then dies down

1269
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:17,833
After Aditi’s father left,

1270
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:19,917
I brought her up

1271
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:21,708
Made her study

1272
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,667
Married her well.

1273
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:26,083
Was it to see this?

1274
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:27,958
Daughter in law

1275
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,875
Why are you quiet?

1276
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:32,250
What do you want to do?

1277
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:34,667
Can’t stand it any more

1278
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:37,458
Ask Chayan and see

1279
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:40,750
Didn’t let anyone know

1280
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:44,500
But Bobby’s grown up now

1281
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:47,125
He can see

1282
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:53,625
No...actually what she’s saying…

1283
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:57,250
Is there only one witness?

1284
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,708
Say something…

1285
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,958
What is it?

1286
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,083
Also silent?

1287
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,042
What to say?

1288
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:12,833
Before the wedding
they both came.

1289
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:16,083
You weren’t there.

1290
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:19,500
To ask our permission.

1291
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:22,875
Nothing to say now.

1292
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:26,833
They will decide to separate.

1293
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:31,375
We will decide where
Bobby lives.

1294
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:36,958
Do what they think best

1295
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,083
Now ask Bobby, sister

1296
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,333
He can’t be without me

1297
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:47,750
Yes, Didi.

1298
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:53,792
Hasn’t spent a single night in
your home since he was born.

1299
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,958
Always in a hurry to get back,

1300
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,333
Isn’t he ours as well?

1301
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:08,208
But how can a little boy
be without his mother?

1302
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,042
Think of my daughter…

1303
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:20,917
If she thinks she can bring
Bobby up better elsewhere…

1304
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:23,833
Have nothing to say

1305
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,875
But,

1306
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,708
he’s our boy.

1307
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,250
Law says differently.

1308
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:36,750
Meaning hadn’t said
anything so far

1309
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:38,208
Meaning?
- Please

1310
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:44,292
Don’t teach an
Uttarpara Chatterjee law

1311
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:47,167
Neither law nor courts, please

1312
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:49,750
My name is Chatterjee
if I think...

1313
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:53,875
I can bring my son here
won't take 5 minutes

1314
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:55,000
Dada!

1315
01:09:55,042 --> 01:09:56,542
What, what, what

1316
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,083
What? Was quiet all this while

1317
01:09:58,125 --> 01:09:59,958
Can I speak

1318
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,042
All the problems here are caused
by that woman

1319
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:06,458
Why do you phone my
wife seven times?

1320
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,000
Every day.
Why?

1321
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:13,958
Filling her ears with tales.
Shall I say this in court?

1322
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,500
Amazing!

1323
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:18,750
Of course you have
to take your daughter...

1324
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:21,750
...to look after you in your old age.
- Stop!

1325
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:24,667
Father you don’t know everything

1326
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:27,375
Listen,In my house
when children marry,

1327
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:30,417
the mothers don’t peep
into their rooms

1328
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,917
Don’t want to know
what they’re up to

1329
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:33,958
Ayan!

1330
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,958
You ask – my father’s here.
Ask him

1331
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,125
for my bank statement

1332
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,750
Or where I have fixed deposits

1333
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,167
Just ask them

1334
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:45,500
See, Ma, see

1335
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:48,625
This is how they talk to my mother

1336
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:51,208
Hear this all the time

1337
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:57,333
Think, if he can talk like
this about my mother…

1338
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:01,625
What can he not
say in your absence!

1339
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,792
I'm my mother's only daughter
Don't I feel bad!

1340
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:09,667
I don’t know

1341
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:14,042
What problems you couples
have these days.

1342
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:16,917
Spent so many days

1343
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:22,667
Neither did your father in
law insult my parents.

1344
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:27,167
Nor did I insult my in laws.

1345
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,917
Actually...

1346
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:35,833
you lock the door
when you make love

1347
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:42,583
and when you fight
you throw it open

1348
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:47,167
Anyway,

1349
01:11:49,542 --> 01:11:52,000
I’m saying sister

1350
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:54,833
We’re in mourning

1351
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:58,083
Let the funeral be over.

1352
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:02,875
Bobby’s the eldest grandchild

1353
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:04,250
So...

1354
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:07,000
Don’t take him now

1355
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:08,792
Daughter in law

1356
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,542
Let him stay.

1357
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,167
Later perhaps...

1358
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:23,000
Bappa open the boot

1359
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,125
Won’t Babu go?

1360
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:34,458
What Babu going?

1361
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,542
No, won’t

1362
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,958
Daughter in law

1363
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:41,250
See you, Ma

1364
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:50,750
Remember I received
you here as a bride?

1365
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:55,250
Such a beautiful day

1366
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:59,042
Thank goodness your uncle...

1367
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,458
...didn’t have to see it…

1368
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:06,583
Ma, here.

1369
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:09,958
This belongs to the house

1370
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:18,542
But my heart tells me...

1371
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:21,625
....you won’t be
able to leave this house

1372
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:23,958
you’ll be back

1373
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,292
Won’t happen Ma.

1374
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:30,625
Take care

1375
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:35,750
Will you come when I’m dead?

1376
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,250
Do come

1377
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,333
Didi

1378
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:50,667
You know Ma and I never
thought the same way

1379
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:54,375
Feel I have to say that today

1380
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:57,792
Hope her words come true

1381
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:02,042
Don’t know how you’ll
manage on your own.

1382
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:05,625
Don’t know what to say.

1383
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,417
But we’ll miss you,

1384
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,875
Look after yourself.

1385
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:26,875
The one who should stop me,

1386
01:14:26,917 --> 01:14:30,917
the one for whom the
ties with you…

1387
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:33,000
Not once…

1388
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:39,458
Anyway stay well.

1389
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:43,667
Keep Ma company and
don’t let her eat alone.

1390
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:46,250
Bring up Bhutni

1391
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,333
And...

1392
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:53,875
...give her the ring
- Didi

1393
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:57,833
Kartick see where Bobby is

1394
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,250
I’ll come back for sure

1395
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:06,292
See Bhanu’s grown up.

1396
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:09,500
Don’t chew Dad’s books,

1397
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:12,208
And don’t cross the gate.

1398
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:15,708
Will bring a sweater
from Darjeeling.

1399
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,458
Your mother’s calling

1400
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,333
From today

1401
01:15:30,542 --> 01:15:33,208
Kartick will feed you.

1402
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:35,458
Don’t bite him.

1403
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:39,250
And don’t cry for me.

1404
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,458
Getting late,

1405
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:50,042
Will look after them?

1406
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:54,292
You go.

1407
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:58,667
I’ll bring him.

1408
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:11,917
Come here

1409
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:18,750
Something to say to you

1410
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:20,250
Say what?

1411
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:33,167
You’re leaving

1412
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:34,458
Yes

1413
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,708
Where to?

1414
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,958
Darjeeling

1415
01:16:38,167 --> 01:16:39,917
When are you back

1416
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,708
Don’t know

1417
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:44,167
Chocolate for you

1418
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,500
Thank you

1419
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:48,750
Who will I play cricket
with now?

1420
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,875
Don’t worry,

1421
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,833
I’ll be back

1422
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,125
Don’t worry

1423
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:03,292
Bhutun and I will look after Bhanu

1424
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,125
Don’t go near the gorges,

1425
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,625
don’t catch cold.

1426
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,958
And listen call me
when you feel like it.

1427
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:22,208
I’ll come

1428
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,542
Everyone run out!
Damn!

1429
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:19,458
Hello

1430
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,917
What...what are you saying?

1431
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,458
Who’s phoned?

1432
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,750
Yes, yes, tell me.

1433
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,042
OK, OK.

1434
01:18:30,292 --> 01:18:32,958
Shall we go there then?

1435
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:34,500
What?

1436
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:36,875
No if we went…

1437
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:39,417
OK…Fine. OK

1438
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:41,417
Whose phone?

1439
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:45,750
Whose phone?

1440
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:47,125
OC called.

1441
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:52,542
Brought down but there
work’s just started,

1442
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,833
so told us not to go

1443
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:02,542
No Aditi,

1444
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:06,500
I kind of think he’s fine.

1445
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,250
Nothing’s happened to him.

1446
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:11,333
He’s fine.
Everything will be all right.

1447
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,208
Shall I go to his school?

1448
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:23,125
May have fallen asleep in class.

1449
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:28,083
ould have locked him
in accidentally…

1450
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:30,167
Yes, could be.

1451
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,583
Hadn’t thought of it…

1452
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:32,500
Let’s go!

1453
01:19:32,542 --> 01:19:33,708
I’ll go with you

1454
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:36,250
No one knows you here.
Won’t let you in.

1455
01:19:37,292 --> 01:19:39,917
Pressure medicine –
haven’t brought it?

1456
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:42,542
Coming

1457
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:59,375
Remember I put it in the almirah…

1458
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:00,125
What happened?

1459
01:20:01,042 --> 01:20:04,625
I…I put the money in the almirah
before returning to Calcutta.

1460
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,458
Three thousand
- What money?

1461
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:08,292
Just kept it.

1462
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:10,000
Can’t find it
- No, now just…

1463
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:12,250
Look in your bag

1464
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:16,375
No, just a thousand there.
Where’s the rest?

1465
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:17,167
Meaning

1466
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:20,042
Almirah.
Kept it there…

1467
01:20:20,292 --> 01:20:23,458
Who would take it in this house?

1468
01:20:25,583 --> 01:20:27,917
Daughter in law can only fight

1469
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:30,083
Bringing up a child’s not easy

1470
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,917
What are you saying Itu?

1471
01:20:32,167 --> 01:20:34,667
No one can accuse her

1472
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:38,208
Shouldn’t have let her work.

1473
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,125
Should she live alone
with her son?

1474
01:20:41,167 --> 01:20:43,667
But the fault’s Dada’s too.

1475
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,250
Leave that!

1476
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,083
Let’s decide what to do

1477
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:53,042
Let me go once.

1478
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:54,167
Dada alone…

1479
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:56,750
No train till night.

1480
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:59,208
Flight’s taken off

1481
01:20:59,917 --> 01:21:01,500
Wait the afternoon.

1482
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,375
Then see

1483
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:05,750
What do you think?

1484
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:08,542
We’ve been up all night.

1485
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:09,833
Ishi?
- Hmm

1486
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:14,167
Give Uncle Nu some tea

1487
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,708
Couldn’t cut it all night

1488
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:20,875
Who told him?

1489
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:23,125
Why did you
tell UncleShibu?

1490
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:24,625
Not me.

1491
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:25,583
Ishi

1492
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:28,708
How would I?
Has to open his door first

1493
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:30,958
Go and see how he is.

1494
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:33,042
Alright

1495
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:35,917
His dinner sat outside
the door all night.

1496
01:21:36,042 --> 01:21:38,417
Yes, go, go.
I have to open the shop

1497
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,333
If Bobby phones the shop…

1498
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:44,750
Where have you
put my son?

1499
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:46,667
Where have you put him?

1500
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:48,042
Sir, please let him go

1501
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:48,792
Stole my money

1502
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:49,750
What’s wrong?

1503
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,167
Ayan!
What are you doing?

1504
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:56,625
Can’t speak.
He’s dumb!

1505
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,417
Dumb? Come here.

1506
01:21:59,417 --> 01:22:01,333
I’ll skin you alive!

1507
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,542
Madam beside this
paper he has nothing.

1508
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:06,417
What paper?
Let me see

1509
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:09,792
Bobby threw it down.
I kept it safely

1510
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:15,583
This is torn from
Bobby’s diary.

1511
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:19,500
Dad and Mum fight
every night after I sleep.

1512
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:23,708
I can understand
what they say.

1513
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:26,833
Deepa was saying
- What?

1514
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:29,958
Sutapa’s gone in for skin grafting
- Yes, yes

1515
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,542
Under Dr Basu?

1516
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:32,958
Yes, so what?

1517
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,250
Strange.

1518
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:38,958
The four lakh bill was
paid from your account.

1519
01:22:39,292 --> 01:22:41,583
Don’t beat around the bush.
Speak out.

1520
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:44,000
What do I say?
Wanted to know

1521
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,542
Just skin grafting?

1522
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:49,500
Or is it for other things
she enters your nursing home?

1523
01:22:49,542 --> 01:22:51,083
Stop it.

1524
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:53,833
Stop assuming things.

1525
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:56,375
She’s my friend.
Don’t dish dirt.

1526
01:22:56,417 --> 01:22:57,500
Do it if I please!

1527
01:22:57,542 --> 01:22:58,125
Do what?

1528
01:22:58,167 --> 01:23:00,250
She’s a slut. And you...
- Shut up!

1529
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:02,917
When did you marry?

1530
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:05,583
Who?

1531
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:09,708
You and Sutapa?

1532
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:10,750
It’s done

1533
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:13,708
Meaning?

1534
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:17,375
Married Dhruv and left
for New Jersey

1535
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:21,542
Dhruv – your

1536
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:23,750
friend Dhruv?

1537
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:24,667
Yes,

1538
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,750
had a huge crush
on you – remember?

1539
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:31,250
I thought

1540
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,667
Thought wrong.

1541
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:35,833
Let’s see this

1542
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:42,917
Dear Shibu Grand,
read all the books.

1543
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:45,667
Liked Che the best.

1544
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:47,375
You were right

1545
01:23:47,417 --> 01:23:49,708
Now I have time,

1546
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,042
have to read.

1547
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:53,917
but you know what...

1548
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:58,500
...when it rains here it
smells of mushrooms.

1549
01:23:58,542 --> 01:24:02,667
Ma gets annoyed
if I write to Dad. Cries.

1550
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:06,833
Tell uncle to send
me more books.

1551
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,542
How is Bhanu?

1552
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:10,833
Any new inventions?

1553
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,125
Is the shop phone dead?

1554
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:14,750
I called

1555
01:24:14,792 --> 01:24:16,458
Rang and stopped

1556
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,667
Didn’t even post this

1557
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:21,417
Not a letter.

1558
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:25,708
A reminder list for
quick phone calls

1559
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,750
Read it.
You’ll see

1560
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:30,125
Shibu Grand. 1 -

1561
01:24:30,167 --> 01:24:33,583
haven’t told Ma I talk to you

1562
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:37,667
Will you don’t
tell the uncles.

1563
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:39,833
2. Will run away when I can.

1564
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:43,167
3. That headache reliever
you talked about,

1565
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:44,708
looked here.

1566
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:48,833
No Japanese pumps
but Chinese pain balm.

1567
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:53,875
Is that it?

1568
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:57,250
4. Vladivostok to
Moscow train.

1569
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:58,208
Send a map.

1570
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,042
Uncle!

1571
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,250
Oh young master

1572
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:10,542
What did you do?

1573
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:12,792
What’s happened?

1574
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,000
Ishi went to call
me from the shop.

1575
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:16,583
What?

1576
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,875
Can’t keep quiet.

1577
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,667
Tell us all

1578
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:23,750
Bulu…you’re an astrologer…

1579
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:25,583
Read palms and tell us.

1580
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:29,083
Hasn’t opened the door all night

1581
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,625
What?

1582
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:35,083
Shut your eyes and
concentrate on him.

1583
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:39,000
And give me a number between
169 and 222 – quick!

1584
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:40,125
Say it say it

1585
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:41,417
Aunty, please say

1586
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:44,250
More rubbish

1587
01:25:44,292 --> 01:25:45,875
You get out

1588
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,250
Number one fake!

1589
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:51,333
Can’t remember his face!

1590
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:52,667
Who do you see?

1591
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:55,583
Your brother

1592
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:56,917
And number?

1593
01:25:57,958 --> 01:25:59,708
T..t..two two two

1594
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:00,500
222

1595
01:26:00,542 --> 01:26:01,250
Yes

1596
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:03,083
3 into 2 is 6.

1597
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:07,250
Disaster!
The devil’s number!

1598
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:09,083
I know…problem

1599
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:12,375
Danger…great danger

1600
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:14,083
My god, Ma
- What?

1601
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,375
Danger for father
means danger for us

1602
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:18,667
What will happen?
Ishi?

1603
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:22,875
Something happens to
father the shop will shut

1604
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,417
Stop being stupid

1605
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:25,958
Just keep quiet.

1606
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,917
Hold on to me

1607
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:29,333
What happened? What?

1608
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,125
Father?
- Yes

1609
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:32,417
Uncle you’re great danger

1610
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:34,000
What danger?

1611
01:26:34,042 --> 01:26:37,042
Don’t know how,

1612
01:26:37,417 --> 01:26:45,125
measure for measure
asked for money,

1613
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:50,667
chain of thorns don’t
know how

1614
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:08,208
Why is this creature
singing now?

1615
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:11,375
Asked you for four thousand

1616
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:12,958
You didn’t give it.

1617
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,708
All over!

1618
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,333
Phone!

1619
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,833
Oh god!

1620
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:25,042
One idiot bolts the door.

1621
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:26,625
The other idiot sings.

1622
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:28,167
Now what

1623
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:30,542
Don’t take the call.
You’re in danger

1624
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:34,042
Shibu, open the door

1625
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:36,917
Has passed away

1626
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:39,292
Listen to him!

1627
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:41,750
Think suicide...or…

1628
01:27:41,792 --> 01:27:46,208
Where are you, come quick.
Uncle Shibu Suicide!

1629
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,625
Shut up! Now!

1630
01:27:47,667 --> 01:27:49,000
Quiet Auntie. Police

1631
01:27:49,042 --> 01:27:51,625
There’ll be a case

1632
01:27:51,667 --> 01:27:53,917
Yes, Saturn in the
seventh house

1633
01:27:53,958 --> 01:27:54,708
Really

1634
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,875
Give me a number
between one and 10.

1635
01:27:57,917 --> 01:27:58,958
6
Rubbish!

1636
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,500
The devil’s number!

1637
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:01,917
Break down the door

1638
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:06,667
Father, father, think calmly.

1639
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:10,083
Uncle went to pick
gourd in the morning, died.

1640
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:13,833
Now Uncle Shibu –
what if something happens to you?

1641
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:16,375
The shop will shut.

1642
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:20,792
Bulu, Bulu, say something.
Astrologer he is.

1643
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:25,042
Predict how Shibu is.

1644
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:28,083
Tell him to stick his hand
outside the door

1645
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:30,250
Tell you instantly
-  Will tell him

1646
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:32,750
Has to open the door first

1647
01:28:32,792 --> 01:28:34,500
Well I can’t predict otherwise

1648
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:36,792
What will happen?
- Police

1649
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:40,250
Phone ringing again

1650
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:43,417
No one answer.
Let me think

1651
01:28:43,458 --> 01:28:45,458
Yes
- Then

1652
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:47,375
Mobiles off everyone. Off

1653
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:48,417
Mobiles off

1654
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:49,792
Everyone mobile off

1655
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:50,708
Father
- Yes

1656
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:55,750
Police arresting you at this age

1657
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,958
Lose our prestige and pride...

1658
01:28:58,167 --> 01:28:59,375
...lose

1659
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:01,875
We...we

1660
01:29:02,333 --> 01:29:03,792
How will we show our faces?

1661
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:05,125
Thank god.

1662
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:08,292
Mobile’s vibrating

1663
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:13,458
What will the police do...

1664
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:23,250
Shibu,

1665
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,667
Shibu,

1666
01:29:27,792 --> 01:29:29,208
please open the door

1667
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,875
Thank you so much.
Did so much!

1668
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:32,208
Nothing at all.

1669
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,875
Man waiting with tickets
at Bagdogra.

1670
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:36,750
Spoken to the Airport Manager.

1671
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:38,958
He will help you in every
possible way.

1672
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:42,958
Inspector,
I’m really sorry

1673
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:46,583
Not an issue.

1674
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:49,167
I have a son too.
Can understand completely

1675
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:51,042
OK. Goodbye

1676
01:29:51,375 --> 01:29:52,417
Uncle

1677
01:29:52,958 --> 01:29:55,250
Tell Bobby I’m sorry

1678
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:25,208
Father had great hopes for Shibu.

1679
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:27,250
Great scientist

1680
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,542
78 went out and bumped
into a lamp post

1681
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:37,083
Shock put him into
hospital for 12 days

1682
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,417
12 days in hospital!

1683
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,958
Wheel was never discovered

1684
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,292
Never discovered Shibu

1685
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:52,375
Where did you go
leaving me in this mess?

1686
01:30:52,417 --> 01:30:54,917
Went where?

1687
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:08,375
Bhuto, you?

1688
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:18,792
Debu left?

1689
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:21,083
I’m Debu.
He’s Shibu

1690
01:31:22,792 --> 01:31:23,958
You…

1691
01:31:24,417 --> 01:31:25,875
...news

1692
01:31:26,417 --> 01:31:28,292
Meaning, sir…

1693
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:30,417
No one’s come.

1694
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:33,250
They will soon

1695
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,500
Will come?
Do they know?

1696
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:38,250
Know what?

1697
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:41,958
W...what?
Nothing to do

1698
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:44,750
Like some tea, sir?

1699
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:45,917
No.

1700
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:49,917
Don’t cry sister.

1701
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,708
Have to think of Nebu

1702
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,375
Nebu’s my elder brother

1703
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:54,167
I’m Debu

1704
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,500
Same thing

1705
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,833
If one sees youngsters going...

1706
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:08,792
What is worse!

1707
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:12,917
Why hasn't he shaved?

1708
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:22,458
I’ll either take revenge
or give up acting.

1709
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:24,333
Mind it

1710
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:31,333
You know these modern boys…
materialistic

1711
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,125
Have some juice

1712
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,458
Itu
- Ahh

1713
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:40,042
Go see
- Yes, Auntie

1714
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:42,833
Kartick

1715
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:48,167
Shut the main door.
No one’s to go out

1716
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:53,000
yes sir

1717
01:32:56,417 --> 01:33:00,792
Thought Nanu invited
me to the funeral today

1718
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:11,583
Family, neighbours
can’t see anyone

1719
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:14,542
Sister you’ve bungled
things I think

1720
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:16,167
What?

1721
01:33:16,542 --> 01:33:17,792
...bungled

1722
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:21,292
Things you say!

1723
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:25,042
Have some vegetable parathas

1724
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:27,500
Come after a long time

1725
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:29,833
Made parathas?
During the day?

1726
01:33:31,208 --> 01:33:33,333
Thought I’d have rice

1727
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:35,333
Rice!

1728
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,750
Everyone forgotten?

1729
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:43,625
Let me go out and see
- No

1730
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:46,583
Let the police arrive

1731
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:48,167
Police!

1732
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,458
Called them too?

1733
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:54,083
That’s good

1734
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,333
Good?

1735
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:58,042
What’s good?

1736
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,792
They’ve come

1737
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:05,250
Got the news

1738
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,292
Who

1739
01:34:06,458 --> 01:34:07,958
Questions?

1740
01:34:08,417 --> 01:34:11,250
Because the enemy’s made
the wrong entrance?

1741
01:34:11,292 --> 01:34:14,833
Heard the car and said police.

1742
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:19,250
Father

1743
01:34:19,292 --> 01:34:20,542
Get ready

1744
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:22,125
Interrogation

1745
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:23,208
Get ready

1746
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,125
Wait a bit

1747
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:30,167
Bobby!
Chayan is Bobby here?

1748
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:31,125
You here!

1749
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:33,250
You. I thought…

1750
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:34,583
Babu!

1751
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:36,375
Babu

1752
01:34:36,417 --> 01:34:38,917
What happened?
- Came so late.

1753
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:40,708
Save your father.

1754
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:45,875
Daughter in law so late
but came all over

1755
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,125
What’s wrong Ma?
Don’t get it.

1756
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,958
Bobby can’t be found.

1757
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,917
Sounded the horn.
Gates didn’t open

1758
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:54,542
Tell me what happened

1759
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:58,792
I don’t understand and
no neighbours here…

1760
01:34:59,625 --> 01:35:01,500
Shibu’s havoc

1761
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:07,083
Invited me but the door’s shut
and just giving me juice

1762
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:08,625
Father what’s wrong?
Tell me

1763
01:35:08,667 --> 01:35:10,125
Come upstairs

1764
01:35:10,167 --> 01:35:12,000
Yes, come, come

1765
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:15,625
Can't deal with it
- I'll die

1766
01:35:16,792 --> 01:35:17,792
Uncle Shibu!

1767
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,667
Babu!

1768
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:22,125
Open the door please

1769
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:23,875
Let me, move.

1770
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:27,792
It’s me Aditi.
Open the door

1771
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:31,500
We can’t find Bobby.
Please open the door

1772
01:35:37,917 --> 01:35:39,042
Shibu

1773
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:40,333
Brother in law

1774
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:41,542
Uncle Shibu

1775
01:35:41,917 --> 01:35:43,792
You’re alive?

1776
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,292
Debu’s not dead

1777
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,708
I’m Debu – he’s Shibu

1778
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,708
All right. A little management

1779
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:53,333
Uncle Shibu

1780
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:58,042
Haven’t anyone except Bobby

1781
01:35:58,875 --> 01:36:01,625
I know Bobby lives here.

1782
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:04,375
Taking him away from his friends…

1783
01:36:04,417 --> 01:36:06,875
Wrong of me Uncle Shibu

1784
01:36:07,542 --> 01:36:11,500
Take whatever
punishment you give me

1785
01:36:11,917 --> 01:36:14,708
My Bobby’s well?

1786
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,875
Want to see him just once.

1787
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:27,125
I know you’re the only one
who knows where he is

1788
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:29,583
Tell me, is Bobby well?

1789
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:33,375
Beg you
- See, see

1790
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,792
Get up

1791
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,208
Bobby...

1792
01:36:44,625 --> 01:36:46,125
Come, come

1793
01:36:46,917 --> 01:36:49,083
Ma, Bhanu’s grown so big

1794
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,250
Bobby, Bobby!

1795
01:36:58,292 --> 01:36:59,833
Bobby

1796
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:03,208
What are you doing here?

1797
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,875
How did you get here?

1798
01:37:04,917 --> 01:37:06,167
Where were you?

1799
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:09,042
Looked so hard!

1800
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:10,917
Shibu Grand

1801
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:11,583
Yes

1802
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:14,125
Tell them?

1803
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:17,167
Do

1804
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:19,833
Yes, left the house

1805
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:24,042
Get onto a trekker with
50 rupees.

1806
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:27,333
Go to Vladivostok

1807
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:28,875
NJP?

1808
01:37:28,917 --> 01:37:33,375
Train AC 2 Tier tickets

1809
01:37:33,792 --> 01:37:37,542
Lots of children return
home alone from school

1810
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:40,750
No one will suspect

1811
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:44,625
From there straight to
Moscow station

1812
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:47,083
Howrah. OK?

1813
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:50,375
Get off at Moscow.
Take a paid taxi

1814
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:52,375
Yes
- Seriously

1815
01:37:52,417 --> 01:37:54,625
Come to St Petersburg.

1816
01:37:58,417 --> 01:38:02,625
Chuck three pebbles
at my shut window

1817
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:07,667
Bring you up by the back stairs

1818
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:23,292
Realise what he’ll be
when he grows up?

1819
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:30,750
Could have said send
me back to Uttarpara.

1820
01:38:33,625 --> 01:38:37,333
Anyway. I’m off.

1821
01:38:39,292 --> 01:38:47,333
One day when you’re unhappy
you’ll realize how unhappy I was.

1822
01:38:48,292 --> 01:38:49,875
And you.

1823
01:38:49,917 --> 01:38:52,375
The best friend.

1824
01:38:52,417 --> 01:38:57,958
Never thought how he’d manage
without you and Babu

1825
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,417
Married on a whim,
divorced on a whim.

1826
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:08,583
Never think a husband and wife can

1827
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:11,958
But mother and father cannot

1828
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:17,292
No win or loss between
husbands and wives

1829
01:39:17,917 --> 01:39:19,750
Shouldn’t be

1830
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:22,667
Perhaps that’s true.

1831
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:26,708
Shouldn’t separate

1832
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:28,167
But

1833
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:32,542
Do they separate on purpose?
Aren’t they hurt?

1834
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:35,208
When I see Bobby every night

1835
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:37,833
Look for his father in bed

1836
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:40,125
It hurts!

1837
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:46,667
It’s over and done with now

1838
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:55,000
Doesn’t work Ma

1839
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:06,250
Aditi look at me.

1840
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:09,917
Look at me. Please.

1841
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:13,292
Aditi what's this?

1842
01:40:15,292 --> 01:40:17,250
Can’t we start all over again?

1843
01:40:18,417 --> 01:40:19,667
Just once?

1844
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:22,792
For Bobby.

1845
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,750
For us all.

1846
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:38,625
Wasn’t I saying matchmaker?

1847
01:40:38,667 --> 01:40:40,083
Auspicious day tomorrow

1848
01:40:40,458 --> 01:40:42,708
Let’s have another wedding

1849
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:45,292
Well shall we?

1850
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:46,500
Let’s do it

1851
01:40:46,542 --> 01:40:48,667
So impoverished!
- Rubbish!

1852
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:52,583
All this for you

1853
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:55,708
In a country where
people starve

1854
01:40:56,042 --> 01:41:01,333
Spending money twice to invite
people to a wedding !

1855
01:41:02,542 --> 01:41:05,667
You’d be shot in Russia

1856
01:41:09,708 --> 01:41:12,458
