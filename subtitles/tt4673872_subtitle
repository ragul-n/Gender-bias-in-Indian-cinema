1
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:11,375
Cigarette smoking and consumption
of alcohol is injurious to health.

2
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,791
Cigarette smoking and consumption
of alcohol is injurious to health.

3
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,083
"Your signals are giving me signs."

4
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,250
"My poor heart doesn't
listen to signals."

5
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,416
"Go carefully on the road, ladies."

6
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,750
"Save me before the brake fails."

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
"They wear mini-skirts."

8
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,000
"I want to go with her."

9
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,208
"My heart is mad. It is dancing in joy."

10
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,791
"Tell me, colorful one."

11
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,375
"Where were you all this while?"

12
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,708
"Don't give me a lecture."

13
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,541
"Don't bore me uselessly."

14
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,458
"My darling honey."

15
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,250
"I know you. You are my lover."

16
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,166
"My darling honey."

17
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,040
"Tell me. You are my lover."

18
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:58,916
"My darling honey."

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,666
"I know you. You are my lover."

20
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,583
"My darling honey."

21
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,416
"Tell me. You are my lover."

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,291
"Hey, hey. You are my sugar baby."

23
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,833
"You are my cutie pie."

24
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,250
"All I want to do now is.."

25
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,000
"go out with you and make you mine."

26
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,500
"Won't you be my sweetie?"

27
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,083
"You are a cutie pie."

28
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,416
"Oh my honey, bunny."

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,083
"I will you mine and take you aside."

30
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,999
"You will understand my magic now."

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,125
"I am Bengali man where my
style and way of life is concerned."

32
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,833
"I will control you in
a way used by foreigners."

33
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:37,249
"I will come close to you and ask.
How do you do?"

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,207
"Hey, my foreigner lover.
I know you. I do."

35
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,291
"My heart is mad. It is dancing in joy."

36
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,875
"Tell me, colorful one."

37
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,458
"Where were you all this while?"

38
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,833
"I will love you a lot."

39
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,708
"Come close to me."

40
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,625
"My darling honey."

41
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,291
"I know you. You are my lover."

42
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,416
"My darling honey."

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,041
"Tell me. You are my lover."

44
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:58,958
"My darling honey."

45
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,791
"I know you. You are my lover."

46
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,791
"My darling honey."

47
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,750
"Tell me. You are my lover."

48
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,625
Hey, fool. - Hey, hey, hey.

49
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,767
You want to kiss your father
even without washing your mouth?

50
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,708
Fool. - Where did you come from?

51
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,101
Hey, couldn't you
wake me after some time?

52
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,541
After how long should I have called you?
It way past noon.

53
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,541
So does that mean
you can sit on my head?

54
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,625
Someone has written.

55
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,500
There is a hole in the tea cups.

56
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,125
And someone puts a stick in that hole.

57
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,457
I think that writer must
have written on seeing you.

58
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,858
Just because your father is alive..

59
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,750
..you could afford to sleep for so long.

60
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,166
Or else, with your capability..

61
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,184
..you wouldn't get a job
for 100 days from the government.

62
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,583
Oh my darling. My sweet son.

63
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,041
My darling son.
Are you awake, dear?

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,559
My darling son.
Here you are. Have this health drink.

65
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,916
What is this?
He hasn't brushed or washed his mouth.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,017
How can he have health drink?

67
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,434
If the company would
have known about this..

68
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,915
..they would have mentioned that it
wasn't meant for sale to lowly people.

69
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,708
Hey, keep quiet. All your life,
you have had a closed mentality.

70
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,083
You don't know anything. - Yes.

71
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,059
In other countries,
no one wakes up and brushes their teeth.

72
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,708
Or washy their mouth.
They have tea first.

73
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,416
Hey, what is it called?
- Bed tea. Bed tea.

74
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,750
Bed tea. This is bed plan.
Have it, dear. - Yes.

75
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,976
Someone had written that
a boy with his mother's face..

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,392
..has his mother's
size and brain too.

77
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,809
I think they saw a sample
like you and wrote it.

78
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,666
Thank God he isn't like you.

79
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,318
Or else, I would have had
to leave him back in the hospital.

80
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,791
My darling son. He is my son.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,958
He will go to Canada and amaze everyone.

82
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,458
I am amazed before everyone else.

83
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,249
Hey, fool, why will you do in Canada?

84
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,958
I will marry a girl
there and settle down there.

85
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,791
Why? Why? Why?

86
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,291
Is there a lack of men there?

87
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,892
Why would they make you, a person who
has failed his tenth standard exams..

88
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,916
..as a son-in-law?

89
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,198
When I come home with my wife..

90
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,832
..no one would look at my certificate.

91
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,017
All of them will look at my wife.

92
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,125
And salute her.

93
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,208
Salute, madam.

94
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,791
Stop. Stop. Stop.

95
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,083
Stop, dear.

96
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,958
Will you take me to
the corporation office?

97
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,541
I am going to immigration office,
grandma.

98
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,333
I am already late.

99
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,583
Okay, dear.

100
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,625
Wait for sometime.
I will arrange for something.

101
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,416
Okay. Okay.

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,666
But with more speed..
Ride with greater speed.

103
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:25,916
Keep quiet.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,041
Ride with greater speed.

105
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,142
Hey, look.
They have passed by. - They passed by.

106
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,851
Hey. Everyone is passing by..
- What is this?

107
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,184
Hey, even cycle..
- Hey, even cycle has passed by.

108
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,351
Ride with greater speed.
Ride with greater speed.

109
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,750
Madna. Ride with greater speed.
- Keep quiet.

110
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:38,875
Hey..

111
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:39,958
What happened?

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,309
Cannot you see the vehicle?
It is not mine. It is father's.

113
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:42,958
Hey, get lost.

114
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,601
You are asking me to ride faster.
Everyone is looking here.

115
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,083
How can I ride this faster? - Hey.

116
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,333
What happened? Why did you stop?

117
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,666
I got her.. - What?

118
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,226
My father-in-law's daughter. - What?

119
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,476
Father. Make the seat empty.
Your daughter-in-law will sit.

120
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,375
Fool. - Hey..

121
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,750
You want your father to
get down to make a girl sit here.

122
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,375
How will I go? - Take a bus.

123
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,291
What? - The bus stand is right ahead.

124
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,775
Take the bus. And go home straight.

125
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,208
I am coming.

126
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,375
Okay, Madna.

127
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,416
It is okay if you are giving a lift
to a girl. But don't do it for free.

128
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,166
Take rupees 500.

129
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,208
Hello. - Hello.

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,333
Can you give a lift
till corporation office?

131
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,708
Yes. Actually I was
going to immigration office.

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,666
Okay. Since you are saying it,
I will go via corporation office.

133
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,476
So what if I don't have the means?

134
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,583
I am always with people.

135
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,207
Yes. - Thank you.

136
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,416
Grandma. - Grandma.

137
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,125
What is this?

138
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,875
May God bless you, dear.

139
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,375
Don't give me blessings. Bless him.

140
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,958
He is the one taking you.

141
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,208
And I will give this bag to him.

142
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,750
Here you are. Hold this.

143
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,916
Go carefully, grandma.
Thank you, brother.

144
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,291
Brother?

145
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,833
Hey, I stopped because of you.

146
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:58,833
But you gave grandma to me?

147
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,666
Hey, you made a fool out of me.

148
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,892
Did you see? Did you see that?

149
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,356
You cheated me and went away, right?

150
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,333
Okay. I will remember this.

151
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,958
You had bad luck, Madna.

152
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,458
Let us go, dear.

153
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,666
Yes, I am going.

154
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,541
You are making me hurry...

155
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,906
as if your auspicious time
for marriage is running out.

156
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,625
Here you are. Have tea. - No.

157
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,375
What is this?

158
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,375
You haven't filled the form yet?
The office will close shortly.

159
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,653
Everything is written in English.

160
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,625
I don't know where to write my name.

161
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,184
There is a kindergarten
school beside this.

162
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,351
Let us go there. You can give
chocolate to a kid and get this done.

163
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,125
Keep quiet.

164
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,017
Do you want me to put my respect
at stake in front of small kids?

165
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,500
Oh God. And you are scared
on seeing English letters.

166
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,583
That is right. What should I do?

167
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,875
Hey, Kali.. - Yes?

168
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:43,958
Look at her.

169
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,088
Can you see how quickly
she is filling the form?

170
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,691
I am sure she lives in Park street.

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,184
Come on.
Let us go and tell her. Come on.

172
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,583
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop. Stop.

173
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,666
What will you tell her?

174
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,499
I don't know English.
Can you please fill up my form?

175
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,458
You will lose respect and so will I.

176
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,041
Look. I will manage it.

177
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,625
Hey, give chocolates to kids.

178
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,208
And give sentimental dialogues to girls.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,083
Oh my God. - Hey..

180
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,691
I have such a lot of pain.. - Hey..

181
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,833
Listen.

182
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,125
Are you fine?

183
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,166
Have we met before?

184
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,333
- Are you on my facebook friend list?
- No..

185
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,833
So what is the point
of knowing how I am doing?

186
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,041
No, I mean..

187
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,416
I needed some help from you.

188
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,208
Can you fill this form of mine?

189
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,291
I see.

190
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,291
English?

191
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,041
You cannot understand it, right?

192
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,184
So what will you do in the foreign
country if you don't know English?

193
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:33,791
No, no.

194
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,457
I mean I know English.

195
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,125
Actually the matter
is that I have hurt my hand.

196
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,541
I have a lot of pain.

197
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,458
I cannot hold a pen. - I see.

198
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,708
That is why I needed some help from you.

199
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,250
Give it. No problem.

200
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,318
Actually what happened is
that when I was traveling by bus..

201
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,166
..a boy was teasing a girl.

202
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,135
When I see all this,
I cannot control myself.

203
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,791
I punched him hard on his face.

204
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,916
He ducked down and
I hit the rod instead.

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,540
Is the girl related to you?

206
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,041
Is the girl related to you?

207
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:00,500
No.

208
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,916
Then why did you want to hit him?

209
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,458
What is the name?

210
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,083
I didn't ask her.
She got down at the next stop.

211
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,166
Your name.

212
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,250
What is your name?

213
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,958
Everyone in the colony
calls me Madu with love.

214
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,309
You can write that too..
- No one here is in love with you.

215
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,413
Tell me the name that
is written in your certificate.

216
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,366
I don't have a certificate.
Forget about a name on that.

217
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,125
What happened?
It takes so long to tell your name?

218
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,041
Yes. Madhusudan Dutta.

219
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,083
Yes. Madhusudan Dutta.

220
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,291
Father is Vibhuti Bose.

221
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,416
And mother is Asha.

222
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,041
The whole family is made of writers.

223
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,191
Wonder if he is getting his
form filled or horoscope written.

224
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,333
Brother.

225
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,625
I am Madan Das. - I am Kali Das.

226
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,416
Can you help me? Please.

227
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,041
What help do you need?

228
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,415
Can you fill my form?

229
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,416
I will take rupees 500.

230
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,625
How much? 500. Wouldn't 100 do?

231
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,250
Okay. 400.

232
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,101
Just because I am in a desperate
condition, you are saying this?

233
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,125
I will give 200.

234
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,541
Last is 350.

235
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,041
Okay. - Yes.

236
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,958
Consider me as your
brother and take 250.

237
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,166
Oh God. Your hands are
shaking to give 250 to me.

238
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,958
What shall I do?

239
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,059
Till now, I was in the habit
of begging and taking money.

240
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,559
I didn't have the
habit of giving anything.

241
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,184
This is the first time.
That is why my hands are shaking.

242
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay. Give it. - Oh no.

243
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,291
Form?

244
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:11,583
Oh yes. There she is.

245
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,875
Your sister-in-law is filling
the form of someone there.

246
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,666
Go and ask her to do it for you.

247
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,333
Thank you, brother. - Brother Kali.

248
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,916
Here you are. Sign it here. - Okay.

249
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,041
I will sign it outside.

250
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,976
What should I say to you.. - Let it be.

251
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,500
No need to say anything.

252
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,976
Are you blind?
Can't you watch it while walking?

253
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,416
Don't be rude and talk politely.

254
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,392
Or else, I will give you one..
- What will you give?

255
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,476
I will plant. I will plant
a flag in front of the house.

256
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
The people of your house
wouldn't be able to go out

257
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,125
Hey, you slapped me so hard?

258
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,416
Hey, you have an injured hand, right?

259
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,375
And it is paining a lot?

260
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,458
You cannot hold a pen.

261
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,441
It hurts when I am about to write.
Not when I have to thrash.

262
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Get lost.

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,541
He has slapped me twice?

264
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,500
Where are you going?

265
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,559
Earlier, you gave the responsibility
of an old woman to me.

266
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,059
And that took away
half a liter of my petrol.

267
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,375
I gave 250 outside
for you to fill my form.

268
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,858
You are leaving without doing that?

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,375
Who did you give 250 to?

270
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,750
Why? That man is standing there.
Your agent. -What?

271
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,208
Hey.. - Idiot!

272
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,500
Three slaps on the cheeks of Madan Das?

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,184
Just because I don't have the means..

274
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,288
..everyone is thrashing me.

275
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,250
Oh my God. It seems like a photo to me.
I am sure it is my photo.

276
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,541
He is darling son. My darling son.

277
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,333
"Bipasha."

278
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,875
Oh my God. Hey, come here and see this.

279
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,583
My son has got into a
relationship with some girl.

280
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,207
I am worried about the girl.

281
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,375
Let me see.
Which girl has he ruined? Let me see.

282
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,291
"Bipasha."

283
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,750
Hey, she is our Bipasha. - Who is that?

284
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,291
Bipasha Basu.

285
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,392
Hey, is she the thin daughter
of Nagen Basu from the other colony?

286
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,601
She wears small clothes and
roams around the whole country?

287
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,625
Hey, no. She is a film star.

288
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,416
How did you know? - Hey..

289
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,166
I saw her on T.V.

290
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,208
You told me that you watch
religious channels on T.V all day.

291
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,500
Now.. - I got it.

292
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,101
You watch religious channels all day.

293
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,208
And when I am asleep,
you watch lowly channels.

294
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,875
That is what I was wondering about.
My son isn't like this.

295
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,375
You have got this picture.

296
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,125
No.

297
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,059
The son has committed a mistake
and I have to suffer the result.

298
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,125
Even God would have
to suffer if he is with you.

299
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,458
She is too much!

300
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,333
Disgusting.

301
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,916
He is doing all this at such an old age?

302
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,875
What should I tell the girl?
She is taking such weird clothes.

303
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,457
What are you doing, mother? Why
are you taking out my jeans and tops?

304
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,625
Look, father.

305
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,348
Will you wear all
this when you go abroad?

306
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,958
Mother. Everyone there wears all this.

307
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,749
Let everyone wear whatever
they want to wear. But you won't.

308
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,833
Always wear Salwar Kameez
and cover your head with a veil.

309
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,375
So that people can understand...

310
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,434
on seeing you that you haven't
gone to Canada to study.

311
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,666
But to choose a husband.

312
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,583
Okay? - Perfect.

313
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,083
You can only take a Bangladesh
flight instead of Canada flight.

314
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,250
Are you laughing?

315
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,875
Because of you,
the girl is going out of our control.

316
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,291
What is the need to go abroad and study?

317
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,833
Aren't there good schools
and colleges here?

318
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,892
Apart from that, only ten
months are left for her marriage.

319
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:58,708
Mother.

320
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,916
The one I am getting married to
doesn't have a problem if I go abroad.

321
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,875
Why are you getting
worried without a reason?

322
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,716
Look, it is a matter
of seven to eight months.

323
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,374
It isn't mean feat to get a
diploma from such a famous institute.

324
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,125
And apart from that, you will
gain if Ria becomes a fashion designer.

325
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:17,250
You are the one that says your blouses
are loose. And they don't fit well.

326
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,583
Do it. Do it.

327
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,666
Father and daughter can make fun of me.

328
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,750
But do remember something.

329
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,434
If you go there and complain to me..

330
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:29,125
..that the food isn't good
or the accommodation isn't good..

331
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,708
..I will not listen to anything.

332
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,500
I will get you back immediately.

333
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,208
Mother. Nothing of
that sort will happen.

334
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,166
I will complete the course and return.

335
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,434
And apart from that,
Canada is a very cultured country.

336
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,791
Only cultured people go there.

337
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,250
Come on. Come on.
Get down.. -Come down. Get down.

338
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,676
Father. I am leaving, father.
- Go carefully.

339
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,541
Brother, don't forget
us when you go abroad.

340
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,767
Hey, give me the garland. - Hey, no way.

341
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,291
Never ever. -Here you are.

342
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,208
Are we getting late?

343
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,684
Look, you are wearing a
garland made of orange flowers.

344
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,059
But while coming back, wear a
garland made of fragrant, white flowers.

345
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,125
And as a couple.

346
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,875
Listen. Do offer veneration
to Lord on my behalf. - Yes.

347
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,833
Do tell the Lord that the
garland should be made of pearls.

348
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,361
A monkey will wear a garland
made of pearls. It will shine.

349
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,416
Hey, keep quiet now.

350
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,208
Father. Father! - Madna.

351
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,583
Father, don't worry.

352
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,675
Your son will do something
for sure in Canada.

353
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,976
I will get married to a girl from there.

354
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,559
And I will start a business right there.

355
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,083
I love you, Madna. - I love you, father.

356
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,500
I love you. - I love you, father.

357
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:31,875
I miss you.. - Father, leave me.

358
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,416
I miss you.. - Father, let go.

359
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,351
Leave me. The flight
for Canada will leave. - What?

360
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,495
I am leaving, father. - Yes.

361
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,500
I have arranged for a menu
for nice food for you. - Manu?

362
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,708
Hey, not Manu. Recipe. Recipe.

363
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:43,375
I see. - Look.

364
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,208
Hey, this is the rose dessert.

365
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,041
This is Sutapa Rai's vegetable dish.

366
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,833
This is Sanjeev Kapoor's
fish fried rice.

367
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,708
Sadhna Mukhopadhya's raw banana dish.

368
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,541
Wow.
- There is more.

369
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,083
This is sweet. Look.

370
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,583
Sweets from Balram.

371
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,809
Deshbandhu Mishtan Bhandar.. - That is
it. That is it. That is it. That is it.

372
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,750
That is enough.

373
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,017
This will be more than enough
to impress prospective in-laws.

374
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,041
Oh yes. Good point.

375
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,708
When you go inside,
be aware of your surrounding.

376
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,750
Who knows?

377
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,500
You might get a Canadian
girl inside the airport itself.

378
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,083
That is it!

379
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,245
You will have someone ready
for you on your way there.

380
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,041
There is one.

381
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,666
Madhu.

382
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,500
I think your destiny
will change right here.

383
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,333
Give me two cups of coffee.

384
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Rupees 200.

385
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,583
How much? 200?

386
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,458
Yes, sir.

387
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,750
But it is sold for rupees 10 at Banipur.

388
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,166
So you should have taken
the flight from Banipur.

389
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,125
Hey, you will sit in the airport
all your life and sell tea and coffee.

390
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,226
You will never be able
to go to Canada ever in life.

391
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,333
Now take this. Come on.

392
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,250
Greeting.

393
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,791
How sweet! Greeting.

394
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,540
How did you know I am sweet?

395
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,583
I came back to Kolkata
after many years in Canada.

396
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,541
And since the time I have come here..

397
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,642
..I have heard only hi
or hello as greetings. - Yes.

398
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,207
Kolkata has become like Canada.

399
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,875
I have heard this sweet
word from you for the first time.

400
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,958
Great.

401
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,267
What do you mean by 'after many years'?

402
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,101
You have been staying
in Canada since a long time?

403
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,041
Yes, of course.

404
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,875
Oh, very good.
I am going to Canada for the first time.

405
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,017
We will go together. Okay? - Yes, yes.

406
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,392
Here you are. Here you are.
Have tea for this celebration.

407
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,559
Take it. Take it. - Hey, hey, hey.

408
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,915
Leave tea. Have coffee.

409
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,458
Greetings.. - Hey, hey, hey.

410
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,375
What are you doing here?

411
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,458
I am going to Canada.

412
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,017
I haven't come to jump
around in the airport like you.

413
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,041
What? - Coffee.

414
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,875
Hey, even Madan is going to Canada. Yes.

415
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:14,958
Keep it in the pocket.

416
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,333
What is your seat number?

417
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,500
Yes. I am telling you.
- Hey. Why would she tell you?

418
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,416
She will tell me if she has to.

419
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,583
I am always with people.

420
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,291
So stay with people.

421
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,416
What are you doing here?

422
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,250
If you talk too much with this coffee..

423
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,499
..I will give you..
- Hey. What will you give? Yes?

424
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,166
What will you give?

425
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,375
I will get you punished.

426
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,000
Security. Security.

427
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,726
Security. Come here..
- One minute. One minute. One minute.

428
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,030
There is no need to call anyone.

429
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,375
I will have the coffee. - Yes.

430
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,875
And the tea.. - Yes?

431
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,750
Will be consumed by my son!

432
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,041
Son?

433
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,708
Yes. That is my son.

434
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,750
Hey, are you married?

435
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,166
Yes, of course.

436
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,166
Is he your..

437
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,708
No, no, no. My husband is a
software engineer in Canada. - I see.

438
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,791
Okay. Have tea. -What?

439
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,761
One mustn't have too much of coffee
after marriage. Got it? - Meaning?

440
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,953
Give me the tea. - Too much!

441
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,749
Let the small kid have tea
at the expense of his father. Okay?

442
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,601
If he has tea at the expense
of uncles at this age..

443
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,684
..he will have a lot of expenses
in the future...

444
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,583
..and you would have
to find a lot of uncles.

445
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,999
Right? She is too much. - Strange.

446
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,958
Sorry, sir. I cannot take the tea back.

447
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,958
Why? Why cannot you take it back?
It is just as you had given it.

448
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,375
I haven't even tasted it.

449
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,503
I took it for a girl.
But I heard she is married.

450
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,041
I took it for no reason.

451
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,934
I am telling you.
Give me rupees 80 back.

452
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,434
Or else, you will be in a problem.
Okay?

453
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,726
If I call my people,
20 to 25 boys will come just like that.

454
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,083
They will come here and
teach you a good lesson. Okay?

455
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,684
Even the plane wouldn't fly in the sky.

456
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,207
The plane will fly for sure.

457
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,666
Let me see if you can fly too.

458
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:38,583
Come on, Madhusudan Dutta. I
have to look for another Canadian girl.

459
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,125
Come inside.

460
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,708
Morning. - Morning.

461
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,892
I am going to Canada. Canada!

462
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,250
Your passport and boarding pass.

463
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,851
Boss. I have everything.
I have everything.

464
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,958
I have kept it together.

465
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,625
What? I had kept it in the pocket.

466
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,833
Where did it go?

467
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,375
Go back or come to the side.

468
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:52,916
Hey.. - Please.

469
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,041
Hey, it was there.

470
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,101
If I didn't have it, why would
I come inside? To clean the place?

471
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,125
You cannot go inside without passport.

472
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,543
You speak rubbish!
Hey, if I call my people here..

473
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,017
..you will get into trouble right here.

474
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,309
The plane wouldn't fly in the air.

475
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,333
Keep quiet.

476
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,583
You dared to slap Madan Das?

477
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,625
You dared to slap Madan Das twice?

478
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,708
We still have support.

479
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,000
I will rebel right away.

480
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,625
"We shall overcome."
- Get lost!

481
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,750
Listen. Can you move the bag?

482
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,166
My hand is injured.
I am in a lot of pain.

483
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,559
Actually what happened
is that while coming by bus..

484
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,707
..a boy was teasing a girl.

485
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,666
And you cannot tolerate all that.

486
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,708
You wanted to punch that boy.

487
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,374
But he ducked his head.
And you hit the rod instead.

488
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,767
You can say whatever you want. - Hey.

489
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,031
I don't really mind about that.

490
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,000
From right now,
you and I will be together.

491
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,208
As you and I are going to Canada.

492
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,958
It is a journey of 20 hours.. - Oh no.

493
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,416
If both of us are together..

494
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,268
..we can spend the time nicely. Got it?

495
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,458
Just keep in mind that the people
make the allowancecement properly.

496
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,375
Not allowancement. Announcement.

497
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,833
Whatever it is.
We must hear it. Just be careful.

498
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,541
Go to hell.

499
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,625
Hey, where are you going?

500
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,791
Forget about 20 hours.

501
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,059
One cannot be with
you even for 20 seconds.

502
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:02,916
Idiot!

503
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,125
Get lost.

504
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,263
Hey, at the end,
you had to sit next to me.

505
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,971
Right? This is called
destiny's collection.

506
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,125
Not collection. Connection.

507
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,166
Oh no, whatever it is.

508
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,559
It is already made. That is why I was
saying that without knowing anything..

509
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:18,666
..one shouldn't give a step pant.
- Not step pant. Statement.

510
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,250
One shouldn't give it.

511
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,791
Oh no. How will I sit with him?
I will go mad.

512
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,625
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,750
Excuse me.
Can you please change my seat?

514
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,541
Sorry, ma'am.
All the seats are occupied.

515
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I see.

516
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,500
Anything else? - No. Thank you.

517
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,188
What did she say? When will we reach?

518
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:42,541
Oh God.

519
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,726
I am talking to you so that
we can cover the long journey easily.

520
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,226
And you are wearing this in your ears?

521
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,458
Hey, get lost. - Hey!

522
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,375
Hey, a Bengali hit another
Bengali in the plane?

523
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,333
Okay.

524
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,708
Don't talk to me if you
don't feel like talking to me.

525
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,541
Even I have no wish to talk to you.

526
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,391
Now I will put oil in my nose and sleep.

527
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,291
Hey.. - Hey, you..

528
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,666
Ask them if oil is available.

529
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,458
Get lost. Get lost.

530
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,541
Too much!

531
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,125
Daddy. - Daddy.

532
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,625
Can we kiss, baby?

533
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,583
Oh sure, darling.

534
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:15,958
Hey, hey.. -Hey, hey!

535
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What are you doing?

536
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,250
Oh God, where did you come from?

537
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,083
I was kissing my Canadian wife.

538
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,291
Trying to act smart, right?

539
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,309
Do you think I don't
know about your intentions?

540
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,041
Since the time you have come,
you have been chasing me around.

541
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,250
What? I have been chasing you around?

542
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,666
Listen, if I have to chase,
I will chase a Canadian girl.

543
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,583
I will not chase a rural girl like you.

544
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,458
What did you call me? -Rural.

545
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,875
Have you seen yourself in the mirror?
You monkey!

546
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,082
The plane will be shortly landing
at Vancouver international airport.

547
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,666
Passengers are requested
to fasten their seat belts.

548
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,043
Close the tray tables.
And keep the seats upright.

549
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,601
She is speaking such impeccable English.

550
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,541
I am sure she stays in Canada.

551
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,875
Hope you enjoyed the flight.

552
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,874
We will be reaching Canada soon.

553
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,000
Canada?

554
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,625
Yes, sir? -What?

555
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,375
How can I help you?
- Have we reached Canada?

556
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,458
Yes, sir.

557
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,791
Can you open my belt?

558
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,875
Sorry, sir.

559
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,833
No, fine.

560
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,041
So?

561
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,375
It is settled. We will meet again.

562
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,666
Thank God we were together.

563
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,559
The time just flew by and
we didn't even come to know.

564
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,625
We flew in a jiffy
and landed in a jiffy.

565
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,250
This was the longest and
the worst journey of my life.

566
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,833
Oh my God.

567
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,434
The rural girl has stepped
on foreign soil..

568
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,684
And has started
speaking in English.

569
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,291
She is speaking fluent English.

570
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,434
You are crossing your limit.

571
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,708
Hey.. - Give me the phone.

572
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,809
The phone.. -From the front?
Where does one click a picture?

573
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,873
Give me the phone.. - Yes.

574
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,790
Here you are.
Your mobile has my picture.

575
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,958
Show my picture to a girl who
has a ration card of this country.

576
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,267
Tell them that I am nice boy.

577
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,750
And if she gets married to me,
her life will be bliss.

578
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,083
Any girl will do.

579
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,686
And if you think everything is right..

580
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,583
..do finalize the alliance.

581
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,809
Hey, only a Bengali can take care
of another Bengali in an unknown land.

582
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,583
What do you say?

583
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,708
Sure. I will show your picture
and warn each and every girl.

584
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,851
They shouldn't get into a relation
with this boy even by mistake.

585
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,458
Or else, her life will turn into hell.

586
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:26,750
Here you are.

587
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,541
Bengalis are the same
in Kolkata and Canada too.

588
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,116
A Bengali will never lose
his habit of bothering others.

589
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,041
Rural girl. - Monkey!

590
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,791
You have saved me.

591
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,640
I don't want to meet
this girl ever again.

592
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,386
She might come to my wedding
altar anytime and break off my marriage.

593
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,291
Oh God. Thank you for
doing away with this trouble.

594
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,023
I don't want to meet him ever again.

595
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,166
Or else, I will go mad.

596
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,125
Oh my God.

597
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,041
"I am crazy. I am going."

598
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:19,499
"To look for her. With a lot of love."

599
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,458
"I am crazy. I am going."

600
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,333
"To look for her." Oh no.

601
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,416
Hello.

602
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Kali here.

603
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,125
Have you reached abroad?

604
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,625
Listen. Tell me.
Did you impress a girl yet?

605
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,750
No. The one I got is from our country.

606
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,875
She is not original.
Only with a stamp of Canada.

607
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,875
But I have my ears and eyes open.

608
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,750
I will impress one for sure.

609
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,166
Watch where you are going, idiot!

610
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,791
Wish you the same.

611
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,875
Hey. Who are you speaking to in English?

612
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,500
What? Now..

613
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,434
Look. I have kept someone
for doing the chores.

614
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,458
I have kept help.

615
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,416
What? You have employed
a foreigner as help?

616
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,642
So would I have a person
from our country to help me..

617
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,906
..if not a foreigner in Canada?

618
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,351
Hang up now. I am in a foreign country.
My bill is shooting up.

619
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,541
What?

620
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,625
One can get help on contractual
basis even in Canada?

621
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,228
Why did he employ a foreigner as help?

622
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,916
He could have taken one of us.

623
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:08,458
I have heard the help there don't
talk in any language except English.

624
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,028
And they don't walk around
or move except in their own cars

625
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,000
And do you know?

626
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,500
The cleaners there
come in their own cars..

627
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,916
..and clean the toilets
and give a bill and leave.

628
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,499
Why wouldn't they drive cars?

629
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,250
Whatever we earn in one
month is their earning per hour.

630
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,791
What? - Yes.

631
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,708
Hara Parbati Rannaghar.

632
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,208
Yes. The address is correct.

633
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,708
But it shows two boards here.

634
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,333
Oh no.

635
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,041
Before the fighter woman poaches him..

636
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,916
..I have to get him inside.

637
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,166
So let me go.

638
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,916
I will go inside and ask.

639
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,291
Hail Lord. - Hail Lord.

640
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,000
Brother. Tell me.
Is this Hara Parbati Rannaghar?

641
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,416
It is right.
If you have to eat good Bengali food..

642
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,851
..Hara Parbati Ranna
ghar is the place to come to.

643
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,666
The dish starts with the vegetable
dish and ends with mango chutney.

644
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,791
When you wash your hands,
I make betel leaf with true tobacco.

645
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,833
Welcome. - Yes.

646
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,041
Hey, Bhola. A family member
has come from our country.

647
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,500
Give him some drink.

648
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:24,916
Family? I saw you today. And you turned
me into a family member right now?

649
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,208
Every Bengali here
is a family member of mine.

650
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,533
Do you love everyone, brother?

651
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,083
Hey, it is the actual menu of Haranath.

652
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't do business for money.

653
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,291
I do business for love. - Yes.

654
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,291
Money is like dirt on the hand.

655
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:40,875
Thanks to God's blessings, I am
smeared with that dirt all over my body.

656
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,708
What? - It snows a lot here in winter.

657
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,583
That is why I don't
bathe more than once a week.

658
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,708
Now look at you. Even I
am in the same condition, brother.

659
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:53,041
It doesn't snow in Banipur
but even I bathe only once in a week.

660
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,666
What? - Yes. Tell me, family member.
What will you have?

661
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,000
Non-vegetarian or vegetarian?

662
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,291
I am very hungry.
Since the time I have taken the plane..

663
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,375
..I have been having
bread and feeling constipated.

664
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:06,000
I told the girls to get
some curry and rice for me.

665
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,575
But they could only say sorry.

666
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:11,000
I am a Bengali.
If I don't eat some meat and rice..

667
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,476
..will the system get cleared? Tell me.

668
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,791
Don't talk about those girls,
family member.

669
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,142
They don't speak a word apart from what
they have been taught in the training.

670
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:18,625
Yes.

671
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,708
When they come close,
they say, yes, sir.

672
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:23,040
And when we ask for something,
they say, sorry, sir.

673
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,666
Brother. Get some meat and rice for me.

674
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,250
Sorry, sir.

675
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,708
This isn't a plane, brother.
Then why are you saying sorry?

676
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,631
No, actually what has happened,
family member..

677
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,582
We are not getting
a proper supply of meat.

678
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,958
That is why we have
to serve soya bean. Yes.

679
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,750
Say this to cheat everyone.

680
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:38,875
Hey.. -Hey!

681
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,625
Go and get a vegetarian dish.

682
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,541
Everything is available
in our vegetarian dish.

683
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,225
Rice, pulses, vegetable. Chutney. Fries.

684
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:50,040
Brother Hara. I wanted to ask
if we could finalize before I ate.

685
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,416
Now look at this.

686
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:55,291
You have stepped here. Now the matter
has been finalized because of that.

687
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,041
What?

688
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:59,125
You are my permanent family member.
Hail Lord.

689
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:02,375
Start eating.
Pure Bengali dish. Eat. -Yes, eat.

690
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,625
Eat. - Yes.

691
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:09,458
What is the matter? It is three.
But the boy hasn't come yet.

692
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Where did he go?

693
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:16,083
Wow. Really, brother Hara.

694
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,458
Your cooking is too good.

695
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:22,165
Hey, this is nothing. 420. - Yes.

696
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,833
Fool!

697
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,458
What happened, family member?

698
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:26,976
Was there something
lacking in us as hosts?

699
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
You used abusive language.

700
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:29,875
Hey, not you.

701
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,791
People curse Bengalis.

702
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,767
About Bengalis changing
when they go abroad.

703
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,226
They should be taken by their
ears and brought here and shown. Look.

704
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,610
Bengalis do take care of Bengalis.

705
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,875
Hey, I do as much as I can.

706
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:45,166
Really, brother Hara.
You are taking care of me like a father.

707
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,916
I am forgetting my father's
name in this condition.

708
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,208
Don't be so emotional, family member.

709
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,166
One minute.

710
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,375
Oh my God, this is a call from you.

711
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,208
Hey, it isn't my phone.
It is your phone.

712
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,976
Yes. The phone is mine.
But the call is yours.

713
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,250
Now look at you.

714
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,749
How can I call on your phone? -Yes.

715
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,017
I think you are still on the plane.

716
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,375
And your head is feeling dizzy.

717
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,083
But the number is of your hotel.

718
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,416
Wait.

719
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:15,375
Hello.

720
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:19,041
Hello. Where are you? Parbati here.
From Hara Parbati Ranna Ghar.

721
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,791
Parbati? - Oh my God.

722
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,458
Hello. Do bless me.

723
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:25,124
Brother, forget about blessing you.
It is three. Where are you?

724
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:28,083
Oh my God. I have been sitting
since a long time. Now here I am.

725
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,333
I have had my meal.

726
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,791
Now I am having betel. 420.

727
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,166
What? Where?

728
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,416
I cannot see you.

729
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:35,767
What will happen now?
- Now listen to me.

730
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:36,791
Hey, I am here.

731
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,184
I have to get rid of
him before trouble comes here.

732
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,309
Trust me.
- Or else, we will not be forgiven.

733
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,166
I am telling the truth. - Hey.

734
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:42,291
I am right here.
Sitting in Hara Parbati Ranna Ghar.

735
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,767
Here he is.
Brother Hara is standing here.

736
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:44,708
What?

737
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:48,832
Hara? Hey, that means you
have fallen into the trap of a cheat.

738
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,875
Cheat? Brother Hara?

739
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,208
No, no, Parbati.

740
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,000
You are making a mistake.

741
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,500
Brother Hara is very simple.

742
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,463
He treated me like his own son and
made me eat food with so much of love.

743
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,375
He gave me betel leaf number 420 to me.

744
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,434
I think I have come to
the hotel of my own father.

745
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:03,666
Hey, get lost.

746
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,375
May your father get ruined.

747
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,208
Oh no.

748
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,833
Five dollars.

749
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,125
Five dollars? Why?

750
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,625
Now you ate so much of food here.

751
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,916
Oh God. You fed me with so
much love like a father for his son.

752
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,040
Why should I pay for that?

753
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,582
You have to pay if you
want love from a bachelor father.

754
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:23,750
What? I have come to Canada
to earn money. Not to spend it.

755
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:24,934
I will not pay even a penny.

756
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,875
Hey.. - That is great!
This is a true Bengali's son.

757
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,000
Don't give him even a torn note.

758
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:33,083
Hey, who wants a torn note?
I want a crisp note of five dollars.

759
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:37,207
If you want to work at my hotel,
don't give him even a penny.

760
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,916
Hey, listen. - Go and close the door.

761
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,500
How will he leave without paying up?

762
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,750
I will decide about that.
- Great, Bhola.

763
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:43,915
Hey.. - Come on, fight.

764
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,184
Hey, do you want to take money from me?

765
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,017
Yes, I will..
- I will thrash you so hard that..

766
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,642
..you and roasted chicken will
look alike.. - I will thrash you hard.

767
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,416
Get lost.. - Hey!

768
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,958
Hey, don't hit him. - That is true.

769
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:51,625
Don't hit him at all.

770
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,958
I have taught a lesson
to a lot of Bengalis here.

771
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,267
If you don't pay five dollars...

772
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,309
I will make you wash utensils
for the rest of the week.

773
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,833
Come on.. - Hey!

774
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:01,396
Here you are. For you,
money is like dirt on the body. Come on.

775
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,666
Take it off my body.

776
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:03,708
Come on, buddy.

777
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,875
Don't mess with these cheats.
- What is she saying?

778
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,875
What? - I will give
you a cleansing juice.

779
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:09,767
Everything that you
have eaten will come out.

780
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,208
Come on. - Hey!

781
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,791
Hey, hey, hey.. - What happened?

782
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,500
Hey, get it. Get it.
He will steal it. He is a big cheat.

783
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,976
He went away. - He is a super cheat.

784
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,583
You can only dominate me.

785
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,041
When Parbati comes here,
you shrink like a worm.

786
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,541
Parbati?

787
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:25,707
Haven't I told you?
Don't take that name in front of me.

788
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:28,041
Abani had given me
rave reviews about you.

789
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,375
Wouldn't he? He has taken
a lakh to give a false certificate.

790
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,666
What? What did you say?

791
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,767
I mean, I cooked in the ceremony of last
rites of the brother-in-law of Abani.

792
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:38,250
I see.

793
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,933
Everyone was happy
after eating the meal.

794
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,916
Everyone told me to cook for
the ceremony of last rites of Abani too.

795
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,333
So what can you cook?

796
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:47,250
Whatever you ask me.

797
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,333
Vegetables to chutney.

798
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,125
And flat bread to fried rice.

799
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:49,750
Everything.

800
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,431
Just give me the order and turn around.
And the dish will be ready.

801
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,750
Wow.

802
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,875
You seem like a different
person from the exterior.

803
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,208
But I cannot understand
what you are really like.

804
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,916
Test me. - Okay.
I will give you the spices.

805
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,666
Make bottle gourd for me.

806
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,875
Bottle gourd?

807
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,500
Haven't you heard of it?

808
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,166
What? What are you saying it?

809
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,916
Even kids of my colony can cook it.

810
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,583
Every house has a dish like this.

811
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:16,500
That is why, half of the boys
in my colony are called as Potol(gourd).

812
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,125
Okay. Mr. Potol. - What?

813
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:19,750
The kitchen is that side.

814
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:26,375
Unripe bananas dish.
Chicken with two onions.

815
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:29,125
Vegetable dish. And potato..

816
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,583
Oh no.

817
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,625
Everything is here except
the dish of bottle gourd.

818
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,916
Now I will be in trouble.

819
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:40,458
What should I do? I will call mother.

820
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,833
Son has called me. From Canada.

821
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,000
Hey, son, how are you?

822
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:55,333
I am fine.
I was missing you. Hence I called.

823
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:58,250
Even I am missing you.

824
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,375
Do you know, mother?

825
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:02,618
As soon as I sit down to eat, I remember
the dish of bottle gourd that you make.

826
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:03,916
How do you make it? Tell me.

827
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:08,166
Hey, son. Have you gone to
Canada to make bottle gourd dish?

828
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,875
No, no, I will not make it.
I have kept an aunt to cook for me.

829
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,791
She is a foreigner. And she
doesn't know how to make that dish.

830
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:15,833
I will teach her.

831
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:19,458
My son has kept a foreigner
to cook food. - Really?

832
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:22,291
He will teach her to
make bottle gourd dish to her.

833
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:27,166
Hey, son. Tell aunt to
wash the bottle gourd well.

834
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,625
Isn't it great? Didn't I tell you
even kids from my colony can make it?

835
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:46,000
It has been made like kids.
You need to make this better.

836
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,750
Remain in my training.
Everything will be fine.

837
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:53,166
If you want to stay here,
keep two things in mind like a pillar.

838
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:53,916
Yes, tell me.

839
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:57,583
None of the customers
should go to the cheat's hotel.

840
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:59,041
Don't worry.

841
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,500
I will pull everyone and get them here.

842
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,582
Yes. Great.
- Tell me about pillar number two.

843
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:09,833
We have to think of a way
where the servant, Bhola, leaves him.

844
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,250
And he has to sit idle
in his hotel and kill flies.

845
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:15,333
Keep the flies ready. I will
make sure he goes away right away.

846
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,250
Just give me a permanent job.

847
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:19,916
Sure. - What?

848
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,291
Just do something.

849
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,975
Do away with the
Kolkata Sim card. - Yes.

850
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,791
I will give you a local sim card. - Yes.

851
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,675
Or else, everything that you earn
will be blown off in the phone usage.

852
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,165
Great. Great.
I knew it that you would do this for me.

853
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:33,500
Hey, only a Bengali will take
care of a Bengali in an unknown land.

854
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,250
Go.

855
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,458
Come on time tomorrow.

856
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,291
Where will I go? -To your house.

857
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:40,958
What?

858
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,416
I have given you a job.
Not a daughter where you can stay..

859
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,375
..at my place as a live in son-in-law.

860
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:48,875
When given a little,
they want everything. He is too much.

861
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,833
I am sure she has been
cheated by a Bengali.

862
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,248
Or else, she gave me a job.
But not a place to stay?

863
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,791
Let me go.
I will have to find a place to stay.

864
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,083
So Miss Ria? How do you like the house?

865
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,208
It is good.

866
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,958
And very close to my college as well.

867
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:15,583
But isn't the rent a bit high?
I mean isn't the rent a bit high?

868
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,083
Six months rent weekly.

869
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,333
And an advance rent of 4 months.

870
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:23,083
Look, the offer is 1000 dollars.

871
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:26,375
But since you are a student,
I am offering it cheap.

872
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay. I will take it.

873
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,125
So you will have to
get the rent by evening.

874
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,166
Or the house goes to someone else.

875
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,125
No issues.
I will withdraw the money and meet you.

876
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,250
I will meet you in the evening then.
- No problem.

877
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,458
Thank you. Bye, bye. - Bye.

878
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:54,833
Hey, hey.. - Get back.
- Help! Help!

879
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:08,000
I just have 160 dollars.
I have to pay the man by evening.

880
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,291
How will I arrange
for so much of money? Crap.

881
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:16,148
If I call at home, mother
will ask me to come back right away.

882
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:20,791
Let me find some other accommodation.

883
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,875
Hi, I am Ria.
I saw your ad in the paper.

884
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:43,208
Hello, Ria.
From which part of India are you?

885
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,125
I am from Kolkata.

886
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,416
Kolkata? Bengali?

887
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:50,583
I see.

888
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:53,166
So we can talk in Bengali.

889
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,375
Do you know Bengali?

890
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,750
Hey, even I am from Kolkata.

891
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,541
I have studied in Presidency.
I am a true Bengali.

892
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,875
Oh God.

893
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:05,466
I saw your name as Kathy in the
ad and hence, didn't understand at all.

894
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,291
I was Kathakali before marriage.

895
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:11,000
Kathakali Basu.
After I got married to Roger here..

896
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,875
..my name was shortened
to Kathy from Kathakali.

897
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:14,666
I see.

898
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,374
Roger passed away two years back.

899
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,166
Now it is only me
and this house of mine.

900
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,958
Of course, Jennifer, daughter
of Roger from his first marriage..

901
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,958
..comes to meet me at times.

902
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,458
Ma'am.

903
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,708
Can you give me a room to stay here?

904
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:32,333
I see. You got a bit delayed, Ria.

905
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,916
I gave that space
to someone on rent today.

906
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,124
I see. My bad luck.

907
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:42,250
No, no, wait. I can make an arrangement.

908
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,291
If you want,
you can share the space with that boy.

909
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:49,916
He is the one I am talking about.
- No, ma'am.

910
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,791
I am not sure. I mean..

911
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:54,040
.. I don't know him at all.
How would he be?

912
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,541
I don't think there should be a problem.
The boy is decent.

913
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:02,250
"Bipasha."

914
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,291
Yes. Come on, Bips.
I have made space for you.

915
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:12,000
I am sure you are wondering
about my weirdness, right?

916
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:15,665
I am looking for a Canadian
wife and yet, I am in love with you.

917
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,125
Hey, let me clear something, dear.

918
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,500
I don't care who comes to my life.

919
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,559
You will always remain in
my life like you are right now.

920
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,500
Excuse me.

921
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,291
"Bipasha."
- Yes, aunt.

922
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,666
Sorry. I have forgotten your name.

923
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,791
It is Madhusudan Dutta in the passport.

924
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,041
But everyone calls me Madhu with love.

925
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,976
But he isn't like Madhu(honey) at all.
- What is this?

926
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,041
He is like poison.

927
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,583
Hey, rural girl? You are here?

928
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:39,791
Oh God.

929
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,833
So you both know each other?

930
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,249
Then there is no problem.
Both of you can share and stay here.

931
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,875
Share? With a monkey like him? - What?

932
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,684
If need be, I will sleep on the streets.
- Do that.

933
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:49,726
Or go back to Kolkata. -Go back.

934
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,915
I will not stay a kilometer
within where he is staying.

935
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,750
Hey, get lost.
It seems I have invited you.

936
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:58,916
Ma'am. Let me warn you. You have
given this place to a very lowly person.

937
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,708
You will repent later.
- Hey, rural girl.

938
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,708
One mustn't give a statement
like that without knowing a person.

939
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:04,957
Not that! Statement!

940
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,351
Yes, whatever it is.
One mustn't give it.

941
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,851
Now go. Go and look
for another place. Go.

942
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,041
Get lost. - Get lost.

943
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:09,791
Listen.

944
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,583
Hey, aunt. -Yes?

945
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,958
Don't give me such lowly
girls to stay with me.

946
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,345
You can tell me if
it is a local girl. Okay?

947
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,625
Hey, rural girl. One minute.

948
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,291
You mustn't jump and leave.

949
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,601
Firstly, it is a foreign country.
Secondly, you are alone.

950
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,976
And thirdly,
you don't have a place to stay.

951
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,240
And then, it is very cold here.

952
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,583
I know you don't like me at all.

953
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:35,333
But yet, knowing there
are so many problems..

954
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,750
..can I leave you alone?

955
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:40,833
Do something.
Take this blanket. Wrap this up.

956
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,236
And go and sleep in the park. Go.

957
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:43,833
Don't say thank you.

958
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:46,395
A Bengali will look after a
Bengali in a foreign country, right?

959
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,458
Monkey!

960
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,000
Oh no. These times are not
apt for people trying to do good.

961
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,041
Indo Canadian marriage bureau.

962
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:30,916
125, main street, Vancouver.

963
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:34,875
Shabari Williams.

964
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,583
Life safety insurance.

965
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:41,556
Let me do something in life.
After that, I will think about safety.

966
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:42,998
Let me write this as well.

967
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,500
Hey, rural girl.

968
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,666
What are you doing here?

969
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,892
You were hiding in the
bathroom all night, right?

970
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:00,934
The way of escaping from paying rent.

971
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:01,958
Don't talk rubbish.

972
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:02,916
What rubbish did I say?

973
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,642
You are staying in my
house and answering back?

974
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,707
Have you bought this place?
You are a tenant and so am I.

975
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,583
Tenant? Who kept you as one?

976
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:11,083
Aunt.. - I. I did.

977
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,458
You?

978
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,083
She came very late at night yesterday.
I couldn't tell you.

979
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,375
I have some status in life.

980
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,392
I have connections with very
high profile people in the share market.

981
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:22,976
How can I stay with
just any lowly person?

982
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,583
Hey. Who did you call as lowly?

983
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,083
Calm down. Calm down.

984
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,833
Okay. She is a girl who is alone.
Where would she go?

985
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,458
There are so many rooms.

986
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,750
You can stay in one.
And she can stay in one.

987
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,895
It is your house. Everything
will happen according to your wish.

988
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,726
Apart from that, Bengalis have to take
care of Bengalis in a foreign country.

989
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,500
Or else, will Chinese look after us?

990
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,125
Let it be. Don't try to act great.

991
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,791
I have some conditions.

992
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:42,833
Tell me. Tell me.

993
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,500
First. Don't enter
my room even by mistake.

994
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,309
Now look at her. Don't I have my
own room? Why would I enter your room?

995
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,333
Go ahead.

996
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:50,666
Don't drink and come home.

997
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,500
She is talking like kids.

998
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:55,392
Why would I drink outside and come home?
I will drink at home. Right?

999
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,875
In your own room. - Okay.

1000
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,583
Lext..

1001
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,583
Not lext.. Anyway. Third.

1002
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,541
I will use the bathroom
in the morning first.

1003
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:07,875
Oh my God. Is that so? Use it.

1004
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:10,416
I don't have a habit
of waking up in the morning.

1005
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:13,083
Paper man and milk
man wake up in the morning.

1006
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,416
I have some high tastes.

1007
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:17,142
Completely different style of landlord.

1008
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:19,875
When the Sun is high in the sky,
I wake up.

1009
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,500
So landlord. -Yes?

1010
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,250
Do you have some conditions?

1011
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:25,458
I just have one condition.

1012
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:26,250
What is it? Tell me.

1013
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,333
Now..

1014
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,875
When it rains in the night
and there is lightening..

1015
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,750
..heroines of Hindi films hug the hero.

1016
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,875
She mustn't hug me and all.

1017
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,708
My body and my soul.

1018
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:39,416
I have saved everything
for my true love.

1019
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,708
Hey, hello.

1020
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,832
If need be,
I will hug an electric wire but not you.

1021
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,500
Get rid of these misconceptions.
Or else, you will be in trouble.

1022
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,886
Did you see? She has started troubling
me since the time she has come.

1023
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,625
How will she stay with me all my life?

1024
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,583
Hey, what rubbish are you saying?

1025
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:53,833
What rubbish are you saying?

1026
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,041
Oh my God.

1027
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,499
I cannot tolerate these two anymore.

1028
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,916
Listen. If you have to live in Canada..

1029
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,958
..stay peacefully with each other.

1030
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,041
Okay?

1031
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,000
You didn't get any girl?

1032
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,333
You have made her stick
to me since the airport?

1033
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,605
I don't what was the evil
moment when I met him at the airport.

1034
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,875
I have heard that your company
is very famous, Mr. Banerjee.

1035
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,291
Canada girls are crazy about Mr.
Banerjee.

1036
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:27,958
Yes.

1037
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:30,333
I have draped saris on
so many white skinned girls..

1038
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:33,041
..and made them sit
on the wedding altar.

1039
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,833
I have come to you with that hope.

1040
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,415
Just do me a favor.

1041
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:39,958
Just get me a girl who
has a proper ration card.

1042
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,166
I will give you the fees.

1043
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,583
Okay, what kind of girl would you like?
Used or unused?

1044
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:45,375
Meaning?

1045
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,250
No, look.
If you need a divorcee or widow..

1046
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,933
..then it would be five hundred dollars.

1047
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:52,415
Otherwise, if she is unmarried,
it would be 1500 dollars.

1048
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:53,208
Unmarried. Unmarried.

1049
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,083
Okay, fine.

1050
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:55,291
Keep this with me. - Okay.

1051
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,083
I will call you next week.

1052
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,166
Okay.

1053
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,208
Hello. I am from Indo
Canadian marriage bureau.

1054
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,458
Mr. Banerjee here. Tell me.

1055
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,083
Oh my God.

1056
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:10,516
Even you are in the
queue to get married?

1057
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,666
Wait.
I will teach you a lesson.

1058
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,710
These boys are from rich families.
What can I say?

1059
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,400
Come and see the bio date
of people here. You can understand.

1060
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,083
Yes, yes, yes. That is right.

1061
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:22,666
Trust me. It will be done.

1062
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,666
Canadian girls are crazy about Mr.
Banerjee.

1063
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,333
Hi.

1064
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,916
Hello. - May I have a seat?

1065
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Please. - Thanks.

1066
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,041
Indian?

1067
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,000
Bengali?

1068
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,041
And you? - Same.

1069
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,375
Suzie.

1070
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,041
Suzie.

1071
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:42,291
Yes. - So is that name shortened
from Suchitra or Sumona?

1072
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,041
Sujata.

1073
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,791
Actually no one could
pronounce my name here.

1074
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,000
It would sound horrible.

1075
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,583
So I asked them to call me Suzie.

1076
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,041
By the way, I am Ria.

1077
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,250
I see.

1078
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:55,875
What after that?

1079
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,726
I was under a compulsion and
had to share the place with someone.

1080
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:03,875
But I think you should have told your
parents about your financial crisis.

1081
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:06,676
Then I wouldn't be
able to stay here anymore.

1082
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:08,625
Mother is always tensed about me anyway.

1083
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,059
If she comes to know about all this,
she will ask me to come back right away.

1084
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,916
Then how are you managing?

1085
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,666
I have already paid the college fees.

1086
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,833
If I can manage for sometime,
the problem will be solved.

1087
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,458
By the way, what does your room mate do?

1088
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:21,875
My room mate?

1089
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,291
It would be better
if you don't ask about him.

1090
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:27,083
He says he works in the share market.

1091
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:30,041
But I do have a doubt if
he knows where the share market is.

1092
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,500
Hey.. - What is this?

1093
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:47,125
How did you come here?

1094
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,333
Internal connection. The kitchen.

1095
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,434
So why are there dirty dishes
lying around? Go on. Come on, get lost.

1096
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,583
Hello, look at me.

1097
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:56,416
I did.

1098
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:57,708
I need salad.

1099
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:00,666
Right. Is this your uncle's house?

1100
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,750
He needs salad.

1101
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:04,041
You have cheated us of five dollars.
Give me salad.

1102
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,285
I will do away with the bill.

1103
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:09,041
Forget about the money.
Think of how to save your job first.

1104
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,375
I am not scared of losing the job.

1105
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:13,934
If you are not, I will make you scared.

1106
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,267
Haven't you given your photo at Mr.
Banerjee's marriage bureau?

1107
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,651
If Hara comes to know about this..

1108
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:19,833
..he will make you stand
in front of the door..

1109
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,395
..and kick you twice on your backside.

1110
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:25,791
What did you go there for?
To sell wedding finery?

1111
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:28,083
Even you went there to look for a girl.

1112
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,625
If Parbati comes to know this...

1113
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:32,000
she will kick you on your
backside once. That is it.

1114
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,083
Not anymore.

1115
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,375
Okay, Bhola.

1116
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:50,333
Why is the condition of
Hara Parbati Rannaghar so bad?

1117
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,625
The condition was very good earlier.

1118
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,291
When both of them had an affair. - What?

1119
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,708
Meaning Hara and Parbati had an affair?

1120
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:00,791
Yes.

1121
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,833
Hara and Parbati had eloped
from their house and come here.

1122
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:07,916
They came here and
opened a small restaurant.

1123
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:11,541
And they named it as
Hara Parbati Ranna ghar.

1124
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:14,666
The customers started coming in slowly.

1125
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:17,665
They took a bank loan
and enlarged the restaurant.

1126
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:21,500
Look. Look. Those were such nice days.

1127
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:25,125
At night, when the restaurant
used to close down..

1128
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:28,083
..both of them used to go
for late night shows of cinema.

1129
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,666
At times, even I did.

1130
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,291
What happened? - What?

1131
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,333
What went wrong between them?

1132
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:40,625
The same one.
Dirt. Hara liked a foreigner.

1133
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:45,000
That foreigner used to supply
vegetables to this restaurant.

1134
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,625
And Hara used to feed her for free.

1135
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:52,708
Hara used to put sweet betel
into her mouth at times on sly.

1136
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:54,791
Parbati saw it one day.

1137
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,333
That is it. The mess started.

1138
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:59,208
Hara and Parbati separated. - I see.

1139
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:02,125
Just as alcohol is bad for liver.

1140
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,500
True. - Yes.

1141
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,625
Brother, give me some. - No. Never.

1142
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:07,541
Why?

1143
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:11,166
You are a Bengali and being one,
I will not let your liver get damaged.

1144
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:14,000
That is why I will have
the entire bottle on my own.

1145
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,083
Now look at you.

1146
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,166
Now look, dear.

1147
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:18,458
In a foreign country.. - I know. I know.

1148
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,333
Only a Bengali can
take care of a Bengali.

1149
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:22,166
No.

1150
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:23,166
Never.

1151
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:24,833
A drunkard looks after another.

1152
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,250
What?

1153
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:29,375
That was a lovely line.
My heart feels happier.

1154
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:33,500
Come, brother.
Come and give me a hug now. Come on.

1155
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,495
Come on. - Come on, brother.

1156
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,791
Now look at this.
Where did he go? Come here.

1157
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,458
Now I will have the whole thing.

1158
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:48,708
Idiot!

1159
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:53,791
Hail Lord.

1160
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,958
Did you have alcohol?

1161
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,083
No. Never.

1162
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,434
Hey, don't lie at all.
Your mouth is stinking of alcohol.

1163
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,916
Don't you remember my condition?

1164
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:03,791
I do, rural girl.

1165
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:10,000
I saw foreign brand of liquor
and couldn't control my greed.

1166
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,208
I did drink. But I am absolutely fine.

1167
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,333
Now you will get a girl

1168
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,017
and say that you couldn't control
your greed on seeing a foreigner.

1169
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,041
Yes, correct.

1170
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:22,582
Hey, I have come to
Canada for that very reason.

1171
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:23,642
I will get her as soon as I get one.

1172
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,809
I feel like holding you by
the shoulders and throwing you out.

1173
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:30,250
No, never. You cannot do that with me.

1174
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,458
Rural girl.

1175
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,726
Because only a Bengali will
care for a Bengali in a foreign country.

1176
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,750
Get lost.

1177
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,538
Will you go to your room
or should I call aunt Kathy?

1178
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,400
Call aunt Kathy? Do you think
this is your father's property?

1179
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:45,083
Drunkard.
I don't have time for your nonsense.

1180
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:47,625
I am going inside my room to study.
Don't bother me at all.

1181
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,208
She is going to study!

1182
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,458
Idiot.

1183
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:52,416
Idiot?

1184
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,767
"Hey, the moon has risen.
And the flowers have bloomed."

1185
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:14,250
"Who is it at the wedding altar?"

1186
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:17,332
"All the birds are peeking
out of their nests."

1187
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:20,541
"On this moonlit night, my
heart has been lost to you, mad girl."

1188
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,374
"I am yearning. I am drunk at midnight."

1189
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,791
"Now I will flirt with you."

1190
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,416
"You are my Valentine."

1191
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,100
"I am a mad person but I am super fine."

1192
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,333
"You are my mad darling
madly in love with me."

1193
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:32,142
"Swinging in the cradle.
You are feeling sleepy."

1194
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:33,583
"Leave the aunt's house."

1195
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,291
"There is a tide in a closed room."

1196
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,624
"The water is frozen."

1197
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,476
"Swinging in the cradle.
You are feeling sleepy."

1198
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,750
"Leave the aunt's house."

1199
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,625
"There is a tide in a closed room."

1200
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,375
"The water is frozen."

1201
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:15,875
"Hey, come close to me."

1202
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,500
"My heart is calling you."

1203
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:21,250
"I am a beggar without you."

1204
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:24,208
"My darling.
Please tell me before you leave."

1205
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,833
"You have lost your
mind in your love for me."

1206
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,208
"Hey, come close to me."

1207
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,832
"My heart is calling you."

1208
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:34,083
"I am a beggar without you."

1209
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:37,082
"My darling.
Please tell me before you leave."

1210
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,500
"You have lost your
mind in your love for me."

1211
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:40,416
"You have lost your mind."

1212
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:42,059
"Swinging in the cradle.
You are feeling sleepy."

1213
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,540
"Leave the aunt's house."

1214
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,166
"There is a tide in a closed room."

1215
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,708
"The water is frozen."

1216
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,517
"Swinging in the cradle.
You are feeling sleepy."

1217
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,000
"Leave the aunt's house."

1218
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,750
"There is a tide in a closed room."

1219
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,541
"The water is frozen."

1220
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,000
"In your love."

1221
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,958
"I will hit the beehive with a stone."

1222
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,290
"And become colored."

1223
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,541
"Your love."

1224
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,458
"Will be measured by my heart today."

1225
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:31,332
"And all night, I will become free."

1226
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:32,833
"In your love."

1227
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:34,958
"I will hit the beehive with a stone."

1228
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:38,291
"And become colored."

1229
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:39,416
"Your love."

1230
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,083
"Will be measured by my heart today."

1231
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,333
"And all night, I will become free."

1232
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:44,916
"I will become free."

1233
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,642
"Swinging in the cradle.
You are feeling sleepy."

1234
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,291
"Leave the aunt's house."

1235
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:49,958
"There is a tide in a closed room."

1236
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,041
"The water is frozen."

1237
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,642
"Swinging in the cradle.
You are feeling sleepy."

1238
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,166
"Leave the aunt's house."

1239
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:55,958
"There is a tide in a closed room."

1240
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:57,500
"The water is frozen."

1241
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:00,416
"Who is it at the wedding altar?"

1242
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:03,750
"All the birds are peeking
out of their nests."

1243
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,208
"On this moonlit night, my
heart has been lost to you, mad girl."

1244
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,083
"I am yearning. I am drunk at midnight."

1245
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,833
"Now I will flirt with you."

1246
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:13,125
"You are my Valentine."

1247
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,083
"I am a mad person but I am super fine."

1248
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,749
"You are my mad darling
madly in love with me."

1249
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,351
"Swinging in the cradle.
You are feeling sleepy."

1250
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:19,875
"Leave the aunt's house."

1251
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:21,666
"There is a tide in a closed room."

1252
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:22,915
"The water is frozen."

1253
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,517
"Swinging in the cradle.
You are feeling sleepy."

1254
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,125
"Leave the aunt's house."

1255
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,875
"There is a tide in a closed room."

1256
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,708
"The water is frozen."

1257
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:34,750
Come on, I will take you to
the best Bengali restaurant of Canada.

1258
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:38,000
True. I am bored of having
pizza and burger everyday.

1259
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:39,416
I know.

1260
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,666
You will love the food here.

1261
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:44,333
"I am Mr. Bhojo Hori Manna."

1262
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:45,125
Madhu.

1263
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,250
I have got two customers.

1264
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,208
Make these ready quickly.
I will serve it.

1265
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,291
Girl or boy?

1266
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,375
Girl. - Hey.

1267
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,750
Absolutely young!

1268
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,000
Hail Lord.

1269
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,541
Listen, darling. Listen, my sweet one.

1270
00:52:57,791 --> 00:52:59,957
A pair of fish is looking at me.

1271
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:03,750
I will make such a nice
dish that they will get up..

1272
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,500
..and say that they will marry
the cook and keep him with them.

1273
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:09,958
Really. I had such nice and tasty food.

1274
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,375
It seems I am sitting in Kolkata.

1275
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:15,708
You will see. The one to
marry this cook will be very happy.

1276
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:18,916
20. 30. And 10 for the tip.

1277
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:20,875
That is settled. Come on, let us go.

1278
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,500
Hey, hey,
why did you leave such a large tip?

1279
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,375
Oh never mind.

1280
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:27,499
I don't have change.
And you liked the food.

1281
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,083
That is it.

1282
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,875
Listen, I didn't like it that much.

1283
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,250
I have change. I will give it.

1284
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:33,541
Now keep this.

1285
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:35,500
Don't mess with my business.

1286
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:38,000
You? What are you doing here, monkey?

1287
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,843
I am taking my hard earned money,
rural girl.

1288
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,041
Who is he?

1289
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:44,958
He is my room mate.

1290
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,833
You said he works in the share market.

1291
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,000
Today, I know of your real identity.

1292
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:52,392
You are a liar of the first order.

1293
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:53,809
You work as a cook in the restaurant.

1294
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,309
And say that you work
in the share market?

1295
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,333
Very good.

1296
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
So what?

1297
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:00,249
Listen. Boys do lie a bit
to get attention from girls.

1298
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,291
There is leverage for 25%.

1299
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:03,041
100% of what you say is a lie.

1300
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:06,541
You are not made of virtues as well.
You were trying to steal my money.

1301
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,708
Thief. -Hey, did you call me a thief?

1302
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:09,958
Not a thief. A female thief.

1303
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,083
Meaning female thief.

1304
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,573
Just because you are angry,
one cannot change his gender.

1305
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:15,186
A lot of paperwork is needed for that.

1306
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,916
I cannot stay with you at all.

1307
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:18,750
So go away. - Hey.

1308
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,250
I have not kept you
as a joint account with me.

1309
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:22,000
Get out of here. Get out. - I..

1310
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,517
I will not anywhere from here. You go.

1311
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:25,142
I will not move even an inch from here.
That is it.

1312
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:26,892
Even I wouldn't go away from here.
Monkey. - Get out of here.

1313
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:27,541
You go. - You have to leave.

1314
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,625
Rural girl. - Monkey!

1315
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:30,226
Is this your father's house?
- Don't talk about my father at all.

1316
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,250
Excuse me.

1317
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,333
I think both of you
have to vacate the house.

1318
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:38,000
Both of you are supposed to
give the rent every week. - Sorry.

1319
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,333
This is the third week.

1320
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,958
Aunt. Aunt, I am very sorry.

1321
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:43,559
I promise.
I will give all the money within 6..

1322
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:45,291
I will pay the entire
amount within 7 days.

1323
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:46,625
Even I will do the same.

1324
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,625
I mean even I will
take seven days to pay.

1325
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:49,541
And apart from that..

1326
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,309
..only a Bengali can take care of
a Bengali in a foreign country. Right?

1327
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,416
No, that is right.

1328
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:54,291
But you have should take care of me too.

1329
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,124
Even I have some compulsions. Right?

1330
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,583
If both of you cannot
pay the rent within this week..

1331
00:54:58,666 --> 00:55:00,458
..you will have to leave the house.

1332
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Okay?

1333
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:02,875
Kathy? Hi.

1334
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,666
Oh Jenny, my dear.

1335
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:06,958
How are you? - Good.

1336
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:10,125
Okay, meet my new tenants. She is Ria.

1337
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,458
Hi. - Hi.

1338
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,541
And that is Madhusudan.

1339
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,250
Greetings. Are you fine?

1340
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,000
Oh my God. You are Bengali?

1341
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,250
I don't know.

1342
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:21,708
I am sorry but I really like Bengalis.

1343
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:23,458
Like?

1344
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:25,166
Like means she likes me.

1345
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,166
That means she has liked me for sure.

1346
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:29,458
Hey, even we Bengalis
like girls like you a lot.

1347
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:32,375
I have done some research
on Bengali culture.

1348
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:34,333
And I think they
are really great people.

1349
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:35,583
Yes.

1350
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,375
Now she has gone overboard.

1351
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:39,892
Even our English teacher
cannot speak English like that.

1352
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:42,500
She says she has done
research on Bengalis.

1353
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,540
She feels that Bengalis are great.

1354
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,250
Yes, that is right. She is right.

1355
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,916
Hail Lord. - Yes, Hail Lord.

1356
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,707
Hail Lord. - By the way, I am Jennifer.

1357
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:53,000
Yes. I am Madhusudan.

1358
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:57,291
Madhu.. - Sudan.

1359
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,500
Madhusudan.

1360
00:55:58,583 --> 00:55:59,500
Sudan.

1361
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:00,583
Oh no. No. No.

1362
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,500
Madhusudan.

1363
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:05,750
M. Dhu. Su. Dan.

1364
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:07,333
Madhusudan? - Yes.

1365
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:09,541
Did you see?
Here she is. She has learnt Bengali.

1366
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:13,375
Okay. Enough of introduction.
Jenny, let us go.

1367
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:18,000
By the way, hope both of
you will remember about the rent.

1368
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,250
Okay?

1369
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,791
Come, dear. - Bye.

1370
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,375
Bye. - Yes. See you.

1371
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:26,958
She said see you.
Meaning she wants to see me again?

1372
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:35,583
Jenny.

1373
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,791
Want to have coffee?

1374
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:56,958
I am telling you.

1375
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,875
So? Did you like a foreigner?

1376
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:07,746
It is something expensive.
That is why it takes time.

1377
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:09,226
But I haven't left anything lacking.

1378
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,770
I have gone to Indo Canada
marriage bureau and given my picture.

1379
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:14,416
Let me see. Which girl might get lucky?

1380
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,458
I have someone in mind.

1381
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:17,166
What?

1382
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:19,083
She is from here. - Here?

1383
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:20,451
Meaning she is white skinned?

1384
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,666
Who? - Jenny.

1385
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,083
Jenny?

1386
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,500
Will it happen? - Why not?

1387
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:28,875
How will it happen?

1388
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,976
I fumble so many times
when I have to speak in English.

1389
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,125
And she speaks English
fluently like a train.

1390
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,375
Between moon and.. - Oh no.
So what if you don't know English?

1391
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,500
You have a lot of good qualities.
- Good qualities?

1392
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,041
Mine?

1393
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,708
What?

1394
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:43,833
Like..

1395
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:48,291
Like you are very humorous.
You can make people laugh. - Yes.

1396
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,666
That is right.

1397
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,915
I am always Bidhan Das.

1398
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:54,333
Not Bidhan Das. Bindaas(full of life).

1399
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:56,105
Whatever it is. As long as it is Das.

1400
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,090
You have a lot of other
qualities like.. - Hey.

1401
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,453
Forget about good qualities.

1402
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,666
Tell me. How do I look?

1403
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:05,958
My physique. My personality. - Not bad.

1404
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Not bad?

1405
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:11,041
Hey, are you encouraging
me or discouraging me?

1406
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,250
Look at me nicely and tell me.

1407
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:16,500
I have seen you properly and
telling you thus. You are very handsome.

1408
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:20,250
I knew it.
But I didn't know I am very handsome.

1409
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:22,583
Since you are saying it, I am sure I am.

1410
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,583
And my style?

1411
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:26,666
Superb.

1412
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,291
And my brain?

1413
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,583
Your brain is just great.

1414
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:34,875
Yes. Then why are you fooling me?

1415
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:36,791
Meaning?

1416
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:40,291
Listen, I know I couldn't
pass my board exams.

1417
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:44,290
But I am not dumb enough
for just anyone to come and fool me.

1418
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:46,458
Now tell me. What is the secret?

1419
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:50,041
What can it be? You are my friend.
Hence I was helping you.

1420
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:53,416
Friends? Rural girl and I.

1421
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,833
How did the world change so quickly?

1422
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:57,642
This is the reason
one mustn't help anyone.

1423
00:58:57,666 --> 00:58:58,458
You are the one that says...

1424
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:00,781
Bengali can help another
Bengali in a foreign country.

1425
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,458
That is right but what is your profit?

1426
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,833
I have no gain to make.

1427
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,125
There is.

1428
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,693
Try to find out nicely.
I am sure the secret will spill out.

1429
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:14,958
Look. If Jenny and you get close..

1430
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:18,166
..then aunt Kathy will
not bother us for the rent.

1431
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:20,546
Maybe she will do away
with the rent completely.

1432
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:23,566
That is what I was wondering about.

1433
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:26,559
How did a bitter person like you start
speaking so sweetly all of a sudden?

1434
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,083
What is the loss if this
gives benefit to both of us?

1435
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,791
No, there is no loss. - No, right?

1436
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,916
In that case, friends.

1437
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:37,500
Friends.
- Good.

1438
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:41,458
So friend.. - I have become your friend.

1439
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:43,125
Not your girlfriend.

1440
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:46,457
That is fine.
But I cannot understand something.

1441
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,083
How will two people speaking
different languages unite?

1442
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,625
Leave all that to me.

1443
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:55,458
Just do whatever I ask you
to do from tomorrow. That is it.

1444
00:59:57,708 --> 01:00:00,125
I am going.
I will go and out in the gym properly.

1445
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:04,041
He has lost it.

1446
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,666
She is lying.

1447
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:08,873
She thinks I have lost it.

1448
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,750
Good morning, Jenny. - Good morning.

1449
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:21,500
It is a nice surprise. - Yes.

1450
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,708
So you exercise everyday?

1451
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:28,000
Yes, yes.
I cannot speak too much of English.

1452
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,726
I will fall on my
face before I speak more.

1453
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,124
So you want to go for a jog now?

1454
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:32,125
Jog(mug)?

1455
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:33,166
Why would she want a mug?

1456
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,375
I see.

1457
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:35,726
So while running,
if she feels like doing..

1458
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,017
..she will sit on the
field and start doing it?

1459
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:37,916
What? - What?

1460
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
One minute.

1461
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,083
I will explain.

1462
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,041
She is asking if you
want to go for a jog with her.

1463
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:44,375
What?

1464
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:45,708
I will jog with her?

1465
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:48,708
Till now, I have just run after girls.

1466
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:50,625
For the first time,
I will jog with someone.

1467
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:51,416
And then, she is a Canadian.

1468
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,833
Yes, yes. Yes. Yes.

1469
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:56,166
So let us go then.
- Yes. Hey, come with us.

1470
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,142
Or else, she will speak
English and make me go mad.

1471
01:00:58,166 --> 01:00:59,875
Come on, come on. Jenny.

1472
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:08,791
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1473
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,065
I think you have become so
good looking after running so much.

1474
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:14,833
Run. Run. - You guys carry on.

1475
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,750
I am tired. I will take a break.

1476
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,208
Hey. I think she will get impressed.

1477
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,434
She is looking at me
and smiling all the time.

1478
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:27,125
What?

1479
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:30,000
I think I will talk
to her about marriage now.

1480
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:31,625
Right now? - Yes.

1481
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,560
What if she starts liking someone else?

1482
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,915
All these good girls
keep their options open.

1483
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:37,666
Hey. What do you think about girls?

1484
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,166
Speak English properly first.

1485
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,083
After that,
you can talk to her about marriage.

1486
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:41,958
Hey, don't worry about that.

1487
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,142
A lot of rustic people
have started speaking English..

1488
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:46,083
..after getting married
to English people.

1489
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,809
And I wouldn't be able to learn English
by having an affair with a foreigner?

1490
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,633
You will see. From tomorrow, I
will start speaking English so fluently.

1491
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:58,083
You want to go for a jog?
Want to run with me?

1492
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:01,125
Jog means running.

1493
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:08,125
Good morning, Jenny.
- Good morning, Madhu.

1494
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:09,916
Let us go for a jog.

1495
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:14,333
Actually I am not in a mood for a jog.
Let us go for a walk.

1496
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,124
Walk? Oh my God.

1497
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,392
She wants to puke right in the morning?

1498
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,416
What?

1499
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:21,406
Oh God. I cannot understand
what this foreigner is saying.

1500
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:22,791
I have to learn this now?

1501
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:27,250
Let us go for a walk.

1502
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,583
Let us go for a walk.

1503
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,666
Not falk. Walk.

1504
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:33,916
Walk.

1505
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,958
Let us go for a walk.

1506
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,208
Come on, we will go for a walk.

1507
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,791
Let us go for a walk.

1508
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,333
Walk. Walk.

1509
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:45,874
Come on, we will go for a walk.

1510
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:47,166
Very good. Say that again.

1511
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:51,125
Let us go for a walk.

1512
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,333
Come on, we will go for a walk.

1513
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:54,416
Disgusting. Madhu!

1514
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,916
Did God give you fingers
to dig into your nose?

1515
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,447
Yes. Or else, why would
each finger have a different size?

1516
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:01,833
You cannot ever get cultured.

1517
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:03,516
Okay, why do girls
always want to take...

1518
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,343
..the responsibility of
making boys cultured?

1519
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:09,041
They don't have any other work.
- Hey, disgusting. Disgusting!

1520
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:10,666
Yuck! - What was that word?

1521
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,916
Let us go for a walk.

1522
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:20,833
Good morning, Jenny.

1523
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,291
Good morning, Madhu.

1524
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,250
Yes, let us go for a walk.

1525
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:27,416
Actually I am not in
a mood for a walk. - What?

1526
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,416
Let us sit and enjoy the morning.

1527
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:30,750
Come.

1528
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:35,583
Oh no. She says
different lines each day.

1529
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:37,708
Oh rural girl.

1530
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:39,000
Come here quickly.

1531
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,083
She has tortured me
with a new line today.

1532
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:49,833
Hey rural girl.

1533
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,291
Hey, this side.

1534
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,958
What happened?
She isn't talking. She is quiet.

1535
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:55,250
Will she talk to me?

1536
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,791
Hey, say something which
will make her very happy.

1537
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,541
I am telling the truth.
Not everyone can be like her.

1538
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:04,083
No one in Banipur or
Canning can come close to her.

1539
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:06,041
Hey, not all this. Praise her.

1540
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,250
And I will translate that
for her in English. - Okay. Fine.

1541
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,083
Jenny. - Yes, Madhu.

1542
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,000
Your skin glows.

1543
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:16,958
I feel like running
my hands all over it.

1544
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:18,291
What?

1545
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,708
Say something apart from touching.

1546
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:21,500
I see.

1547
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,750
Okay.

1548
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:25,000
Jenny. I like you so much.

1549
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:27,309
I feel like making you sit
on my bike and pressing the brakes.

1550
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:27,791
Oh no.

1551
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,000
What is he saying, Ria?

1552
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:30,791
One minute.

1553
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:33,833
Lowly and uncouth monkey!

1554
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:35,250
You wouldn't reform, right?

1555
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:36,476
If I translate that for her in English..

1556
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,860
..she will hit you with her shoes.

1557
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:38,500
I see.

1558
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,663
I thought since she is a foreigner,
she will like it.

1559
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:45,583
Well, Jenny,
he said that your voice is like honey.

1560
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,250
And so are you.

1561
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:50,250
Oh! No, Madhu. You are a sweetheart.

1562
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,250
What? Sweet?

1563
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:56,916
Hey, ask her not to say all this.
Something will happen tonight for sure.

1564
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:01,166
You are such a darling.
Come. Let us go and have some tea.

1565
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,958
What? Darling?

1566
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,541
Hey, tell me. What did you tell her?

1567
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:08,475
She has opened all the vistas
for me and asking me to come to her.

1568
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,125
I told her that.. - Yes?

1569
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,625
That her voice is like honey.

1570
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:13,958
And so is she.

1571
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:14,833
I see.

1572
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:17,957
So she likes this more
than sitting behind on the bike?

1573
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:20,083
Do whatever you feel like.
Leave me alone.

1574
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,041
Hey, no, no, rural girl. -Hey!

1575
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,833
Don't go anywhere. She has
called me as a darling because of you.

1576
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,500
Thank you. Thank you.

1577
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:28,791
Hey, Jenny. Where have you gone?

1578
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,475
God knows where is he lying as a corpse?

1579
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:31,976
He has not been coming
to work for three days.

1580
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,200
He is not taking the call too.

1581
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,750
If I have to do all the work..

1582
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:36,791
..why do I need to
employ people for work?

1583
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,582
"My heart is mad."

1584
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,416
"My heart is crazy."

1585
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:43,083
So you have come? Where were you?

1586
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:44,833
Mind your language.

1587
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:46,791
Give those abuses to your employees.

1588
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:48,500
Hey, Madhu. - Excuse me.

1589
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,083
Mr. Madhusudan Dutta. Care of Canada.

1590
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:54,166
Hey, you.. - Talk to me with respect.

1591
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,333
Listen, give me my pending money.

1592
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,809
I don't want to work in
this lowly restaurant of yours.

1593
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:00,875
I see.

1594
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,625
Where did you get
a job in the meanwhile?

1595
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:04,208
At the petrol pump?

1596
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:06,251
Or else, as a bodyguard
of a white skinned person?

1597
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,665
Disgusting.

1598
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:09,625
Small people. Small views.

1599
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:11,208
You couldn't prosper in life.

1600
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:16,208
Hey, a gem like me should rot
in this lowly restaurant of yours?

1601
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:17,333
High flying.

1602
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:19,215
By spreading my wings in the sky..
- Hey, you..

1603
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:21,583
Hey, stupid! What have you done?

1604
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:26,915
It is broken? Don't worry. It
is a simple glass. And I am a rich man.

1605
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,396
What is the price? What is the price?

1606
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:29,916
10 dollars.

1607
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Ten dollars?

1608
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:32,208
Only?

1609
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:36,083
Hey. - 20. 30.

1610
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:38,125
40!

1611
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,415
Hey, what are you doing?

1612
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,309
Which father of yours will pay
for the price of the glasses? Tell me.

1613
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:43,375
Why would my father give it? I will pay.

1614
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,541
Mr. Madhusudan Dutta. Care of Canada.

1615
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:47,750
Write down the accounts.

1616
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:49,666
100 or 200 dollars are like..

1617
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,041
Dirt on my hands.

1618
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:54,333
Because I am going to buy the Frenchie
of around 30 restaurants very soon.

1619
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,958
Frenchie?

1620
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:58,375
It is not Frenchie. Franchisee.

1621
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,208
Fool.

1622
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:00,892
Hey, whatever it might be.
But I am taking it.

1623
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,665
Hey, have you invested in gambling?

1624
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:04,000
No, never.

1625
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:06,916
Mr. Madhusudan Dutta. Care of Canada.

1626
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:10,291
I have chosen a girl from here.
And I will marry her.

1627
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,892
Has anyone in your family got
married to someone from Canada? - Hey.

1628
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:13,416
I see.

1629
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:16,291
I am going to feed some
poor beggars in my wedding.

1630
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,500
You can come as well.

1631
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:18,875
So..

1632
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:22,333
Think about that and call on my number.

1633
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:23,791
Okay.

1634
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,250
"My heart is mad."

1635
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,500
Hey.

1636
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:33,291
Even this is broken. No problem.

1637
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,392
You will get your price
for this as well. Who will pay?

1638
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:38,541
Mr. Madhusudan Dutta. Care of Canada.

1639
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:39,875
Bye, bye.

1640
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,833
"My heart is mad."

1641
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,750
"My heart is crazy."

1642
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,708
God knows where he has gone.

1643
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:50,583
Hey, rural girl, what is the matter?

1644
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:52,458
You are cooking?

1645
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:54,392
You want to cook for my
bachelor's party so early on?

1646
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:55,250
Where were you?

1647
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:55,875
Why?

1648
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:59,250
I have told Jenny that you
will cook Bengali food for her.

1649
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:03,708
Okay. You can cook it.
And I will use my hands to feed her.

1650
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:06,351
Hey, a Bengali can take care
of a Bengali in a foreign land.

1651
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:09,415
Very funny. Here you are. Hold this.

1652
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:10,958
Cook for your own wife.

1653
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:13,017
Don't want to live in
this country permanently?

1654
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:15,281
Come on. Come on. Come on. Cook.
Come on, start. Come on.

1655
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,625
I will become permanent anyway,
rural girl.

1656
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,416
Hail Lord.

1657
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,916
Hail Lord.

1658
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:26,601
How did they start showing Bengali
serial on the music channel...

1659
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:27,416
all of a sudden?

1660
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:28,875
What are you saying?

1661
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:32,291
She will not let me stay good now.
Come in, come inside now.

1662
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:35,291
Come. Sit. Sit.

1663
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:40,291
I will get a heart attack
because of happiness.

1664
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:43,416
You are wearing this
dress and speaking in Bengali.

1665
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,375
How did all this happen?

1666
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,865
The dress is mine.
And I have taught her Bengali as well.

1667
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,666
I thought rather than
teaching you English..

1668
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:53,041
..I can teach her Bengali.

1669
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:55,625
Wow. That was a great thing to do.

1670
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:57,226
I have been speaking English
for some days...

1671
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,833
..and can sense
an indigestion of sorts.

1672
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:02,166
Madhu. I have something
to tell you in Bengali.

1673
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,041
About how I feel.

1674
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:07,541
She wants to tell you
about her feelings in Bengali.

1675
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,125
I want to hear that.

1676
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,000
Tell me. Tell me.

1677
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,958
Madhu. - Tell me, sweet one.

1678
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:17,541
When I see you, I feel.. - Tell
me quickly. I cannot take this anymore.

1679
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:20,707
I feel you are a fool.

1680
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:22,125
Very good, Jenny.

1681
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:23,936
Couldn't you teach her something nice?

1682
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,070
I thought if she has to have
an affair with a Bengali boy..

1683
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,450
..she needs to know a few
Bengali abusive words as well.

1684
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:33,208
I am sorry. Don't be angry.

1685
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,916
What I really wanted to say is that..

1686
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
..I like you.

1687
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,541
Like? Really?

1688
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:42,500
Meaning you are impressed?

1689
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:45,416
And I think I am
falling for you. - What?

1690
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:46,583
Falling?

1691
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:47,708
Meaning..

1692
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,500
Hey, when I saw you for the first time..

1693
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:51,000
..I fell flat on my face.

1694
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:52,750
Fool.

1695
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:54,416
Oh my darling.

1696
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:01,833
"You are the only one that I want."

1697
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:04,583
"The only place where I belong."

1698
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:07,041
"And this I know for sure."

1699
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:09,291
"I never want to let you go."

1700
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:12,250
"God knows what happens to me at times."

1701
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,750
"My heart feels lonely."

1702
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,415
"It gets lost in your thoughts."

1703
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,625
"Without any sense of timing."

1704
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:24,000
"My heart becomes intoxicated."

1705
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:29,375
"It is in your
intoxication all the time."

1706
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:32,416
"The breeze told
me secretly in my ears."

1707
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,750
"You are mine."

1708
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:38,000
"The wanderer heart tells me."

1709
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:40,250
"You are mine."

1710
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:43,583
"The breeze told
me secretly in my ears."

1711
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:45,957
"You are mine."

1712
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:48,708
"The wanderer heart tells me."

1713
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:51,041
"You are mine."

1714
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:55,208
"I wait for you. Through all day."

1715
01:10:55,291 --> 01:10:57,625
"You are never far away."

1716
01:10:57,708 --> 01:11:00,000
"And this I know for sure."

1717
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:02,333
"I never want let you go."

1718
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:16,041
"My sleep breaks off at midnight."

1719
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:18,791
"At the sign of the stars."

1720
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:23,375
"I keep on drawing your pictures."

1721
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,666
"On a known and unknown path."

1722
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:29,457
"Let us float away on an unknown path."

1723
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:33,708
"Where will the world hide you?"

1724
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:36,416
"I don't know when this
happened to the heart."

1725
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,166
"It gets attracted to you."

1726
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:41,583
"I look for your address."

1727
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:45,166
"And both of us will
pass that horizon together."

1728
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:47,958
"The breeze told
me secretly in my ears."

1729
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:50,333
"You are mine."

1730
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:53,125
"The wanderer heart tells me."

1731
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,458
"You are mine."

1732
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,791
"The breeze told
me secretly in my ears."

1733
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:01,041
"You are mine."

1734
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:04,000
"The wanderer heart tells me."

1735
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,750
"You are mine."

1736
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:36,375
"Why do you look so nice?"

1737
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:39,166
"When I look at you,
the world around me stops."

1738
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:43,333
"I stay awake for you every day."

1739
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:47,583
"I will find you slowly."

1740
01:12:47,916 --> 01:12:50,000
"I will bind you by my signs."

1741
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:54,375
"Try to understand my condition."

1742
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:57,125
"These days, my heart runs."

1743
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:59,958
"According to your signs."

1744
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:03,375
"When you smile,
I die or lose my senses."

1745
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,875
"I cannot explain to you."

1746
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:08,750
"The breeze told
me secretly in my ears."

1747
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:11,082
"You are mine."

1748
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:13,833
"The wanderer heart tells me."

1749
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:16,124
"You are mine."

1750
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,875
"The breeze told
me secretly in my ears."

1751
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:21,208
"You are mine."

1752
01:13:21,666 --> 01:13:24,666
"The wanderer heart tells me."

1753
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,416
"You are mine."

1754
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,250
"God knows what happens to me at times."

1755
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,875
"My heart feels lonely."

1756
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:36,125
"It gets lost in your thoughts."

1757
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,583
"Without any sense of timing."

1758
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:42,333
"My heart becomes intoxicated."

1759
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:48,082
"It is in your
intoxication all the time."

1760
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:50,833
"The breeze told
me secretly in my ears."

1761
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:53,291
"You are mine."

1762
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:56,416
"The wanderer heart tells me."

1763
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:58,708
"You are mine."

1764
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:02,041
"The breeze told
me secretly in my ears."

1765
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:04,333
"You are mine."

1766
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:07,625
"The wanderer heart tells me."

1767
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,958
"You are mine."

1768
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:13,458
"You are the only one that I want."

1769
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:16,250
"The only place where I belong."

1770
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:18,375
"And this I know for sure."

1771
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:21,166
"I never want to let you go."

1772
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,083
I can say this much, aunt.

1773
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:25,291
There cannot be a boy like Madhu.

1774
01:14:25,666 --> 01:14:27,601
He is decent. And is good
by behavior and character too.

1775
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:28,666
Even you know that.

1776
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:30,809
And apart from that,
he will even cook for his wife.

1777
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:31,750
Your skin is so white.

1778
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:34,332
He will keep Jenny very happy, aunt.
- I know.

1779
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:38,208
If he has to marry Jenny,
he has to adjust with Jenny. - Yes.

1780
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:41,416
No local Canadian
boy will agree to that.

1781
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,125
Aunt. I agree with everything.

1782
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,458
I will say yes to
everything that you say.

1783
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:48,541
I will say yes to your proposal
of live in son-in-law as well.

1784
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:49,083
Okay?

1785
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:49,750
Very good.

1786
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,083
So let us fix a date
before the 20th of next month.

1787
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:53,541
Yes.

1788
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:55,468
After marriage,
both of you can go to Africa.

1789
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,000
No, aunt. I don't want to go to America.

1790
01:14:58,125 --> 01:14:59,416
No, no, not America.

1791
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,625
Africa. - What?

1792
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:03,458
Africa?

1793
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,916
Why? Jenny is going to
Africa on the 20th of next month.

1794
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Didn't she tell you?

1795
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,166
Hail lord.

1796
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:10,416
Yes. Hail lord.

1797
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,666
Why?

1798
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:15,166
She has a wish. She wants
to serve poor people of Africa.

1799
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:19,000
Now only a week back,
she has taken a project of UNO.

1800
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:21,250
She has taken Nigerian
citizenship as well.

1801
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:22,291
What?

1802
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,208
No. No.

1803
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:26,458
I cannot marry her.

1804
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:29,017
I have come to Canada from Kolkata
to get permanent residence here.

1805
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:31,833
No. Never. Ria. I will not marry her.

1806
01:15:31,916 --> 01:15:32,958
Marriage is cancelled.

1807
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:35,125
What? - What did you say?

1808
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,625
Marriage is cancelled.

1809
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,208
Fool. Lowly person.
You are such an idiot. - Hey!

1810
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:42,333
You can rot on the streets.

1811
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:47,875
Get lost. I don't want
to see your face ever again.

1812
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:51,458
Aunt.. - If I see you
in this area ever again..

1813
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,184
..I will call the police
and get you arrested.

1814
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:56,250
I am telling you. Get out.

1815
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,250
Oh no.

1816
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:06,806
I thought of something and something
completely different happened.

1817
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,500
Madhu. One minute.

1818
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,333
It is a foreign country.
And secondly, you are alone.

1819
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,183
Thirdly, you don't have a place to stay.

1820
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:19,957
And fourth, it is very cold.
I know you cannot stand me.

1821
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:23,208
But I cannot leave you
alone in such a huge world.

1822
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,000
Thank you.

1823
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:25,083
Here you are.

1824
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,916
Wrap this up and
sleep in the park. Okay?

1825
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:29,083
All the best.

1826
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,208
No, no, don't say thank you.

1827
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,934
Only a Bengali can take care of
a Bengali in a foreign country, right?

1828
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:34,958
Bye.

1829
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,333
Hey, rural girl.

1830
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,675
I climbed up the tree
and plucked the mangoes.

1831
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:41,208
But you were at the root of the tree.

1832
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:44,017
You will have the mangoes and
want me to lick the seed sitting alone?

1833
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:46,017
You could have told aunt that
both of us were in this together.

1834
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:46,625
Keep quiet.

1835
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:48,184
Listen, if you stand
here for a long time..

1836
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,333
..aunt will call the police.

1837
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:50,833
Get lost. - Hey.

1838
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:52,966
Before that,
I will go and tell the old woman.

1839
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:54,291
Madhu. - Aunt!

1840
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:55,250
Madhu! - Aunt.

1841
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:55,708
Madhu!

1842
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:57,416
Don't worry. - Madhu.
- Aunt.

1843
01:16:58,375 --> 01:16:59,375
You?

1844
01:16:59,416 --> 01:17:00,583
You have come here again?

1845
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:01,208
Aunt.

1846
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:02,916
You have thrown me out of the house.

1847
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:03,708
Okay.

1848
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,767
But the truth is that
I have not done anything alone.

1849
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:06,911
Ria has asked me to do this.

1850
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:08,681
No, no, aunt.
- Why are you lying to aunt?

1851
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,583
I am simple man.
I cannot even speak English properly.

1852
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:13,666
Actually she gave me the idea.

1853
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,791
Flirt with Jenny. Cook for Jenny.

1854
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,249
And then, she made me jog, walk and
everything. She made me do everything.

1855
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,500
And she has also told me
that if Jenny gets impressed..

1856
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,791
..we can stay here for free.

1857
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:24,142
No, no, aunt, I have not
sad anything like that. He is lying.

1858
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:25,166
Lying?

1859
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,416
Then who taught me English and made
me go for a run everyday in the morning?

1860
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:30,541
Jog? Candlelight dinner.

1861
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:31,833
Will you keep quiet?

1862
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:56,500
Why are you laughing? Have you gone mad?

1863
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:58,000
Not mad.

1864
01:17:58,291 --> 01:18:00,583
I have seen a lot
of people get thrashed.

1865
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:03,166
But this is the first time
I saw someone going ahead...

1866
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,450
..to stand to get a thrashing.

1867
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,541
Hey. - Shut up.

1868
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:08,791
Hey, rural girl. Where are you going?

1869
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:11,750
Firstly, it is a foreign land.
Secondly, you are alone.

1870
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,142
Thirdly, you don't have a place to stay.

1871
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:14,286
And fourth, it is very cold.

1872
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:17,416
Do something. Take this blanket.

1873
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:19,708
Wrap this up and sleep in the park.

1874
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:22,000
I.. - Don't thank me.

1875
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:24,749
Only a Bengali can help
a Bengali in a foreign land.

1876
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:27,041
Listen, I don't need your sympathy.

1877
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:28,291
I will find a place to stay.

1878
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,375
Worry about yourself.

1879
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,458
No, I am fine.

1880
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,291
I will stretch my legs
and sleep on this bench.

1881
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:38,250
I will sleep. And Bipasha along with me.

1882
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:39,750
Crap, get lost. - You get lost.

1883
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:41,500
I don't trust you at all.

1884
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,642
Then I will see that you will
come back at night..

1885
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:45,351
And tell me to share
this bench with you.

1886
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:48,875
Hey, listen. I would rather
get crushed by a car than come to you.

1887
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,018
And die. - What? So die. Idiot. Monkey.

1888
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,250
Rural girl!

1889
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,476
Hey, what are you doing?
- Leave it. Leave it.

1890
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,541
Leave it. - Leave it.

1891
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:15,500
Thank God. I don't have to suffer
the torture of this rural girl anymore.

1892
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,541
Thank God.
The monkey has left me alone at the end.

1893
01:19:35,791 --> 01:19:39,625
Now you didn't come for work
for so long. And I incurred a loss.

1894
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:41,583
Who will pay for that?

1895
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:42,958
I will pay it.

1896
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:45,416
Say it with respect.

1897
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:47,125
Say it with a little bit of respect.

1898
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:48,333
Who will pay it?

1899
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:52,707
Mr. Madhusudan Dutta,
care of Canada, will pay.

1900
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:53,708
Permanent?

1901
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:55,541
Temporary.

1902
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,833
And my glasses were broken.

1903
01:19:58,208 --> 01:19:59,666
Who will pay for it?

1904
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:00,833
Even that will be paid by..

1905
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,708
..Mr. Madhusudan Dutta, care of Canada.

1906
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,500
Temporary.

1907
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:10,488
Should I give some juice to you?

1908
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:27,541
It fell down and broke.

1909
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:29,333
Never mind.

1910
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:34,833
The price for this too will be paid
by Mr. Madhusudan Dutta, care of Canada.

1911
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:36,142
What? Why should I pay for this?

1912
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,000
I didn't break it.

1913
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:40,332
It is a simple glass. Rich man.

1914
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:44,583
Now 100 or 200 dollars
are like dirt on your hand.

1915
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:47,958
Sister. I will pay
for everything gradually.

1916
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,375
Please give me work.

1917
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,916
I have a condition.

1918
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:54,958
You have to get rid of Bhola
from Hara's kitchen within 2 days.

1919
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:56,801
Or else, you will have
to run away from here.

1920
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:57,833
Okay.

1921
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:07,958
What?

1922
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,601
Should I put this nail
flower on your finger?

1923
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:11,583
Not nail flower. Nail polish.

1924
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,500
Whatever it is. Should I apply it?

1925
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:14,708
Yes.

1926
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:23,000
Oh no.

1927
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,810
Couldn't you apply it even on one nail?

1928
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:26,041
You are useless.

1929
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:28,083
And want to marry a white skinned girl?

1930
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:30,375
Get lost. Go and do your work. Go.

1931
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:32,625
Yes.

1932
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,666
Fool. I have got into trouble.

1933
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:42,875
Who knows when I will get out of this?

1934
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:51,041
You have come back, brother?
To clean glass and utensils?

1935
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,666
Now you look like my brother-in-law.

1936
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,750
Good morning.

1937
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:58,416
Good morning.

1938
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:01,208
So? Did you sleep? - Very well.

1939
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:04,666
Thanks a lot, Suzie.
I was really tensed yesterday.

1940
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,375
If you had not given me a place to stay,
I would have.. - Come on.

1941
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:09,291
My parents have gone out for four days.

1942
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:10,976
You can stay with me in the meanwhile.

1943
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,250
When they come back,
I can shift you to my aunt's apartment.

1944
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,625
And don't worry about it.

1945
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:19,083
It is all sorted out. - Thanks a lot.

1946
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:21,791
Suzie. I..

1947
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,320
I was thinking of something else.

1948
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:27,458
If I get a part time job,
I can pay the house rent.

1949
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:30,541
That is not a bad idea. Let me see.

1950
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,666
Yes? Hara Parbati Ranna ghar.

1951
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,416
Mr. Bhola Das speaking.

1952
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:44,791
Hey, son. This is Mr. Banerjee
from Indo Canadian marriage bureau.

1953
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:46,541
Did you give a picture in my office?

1954
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:48,333
Yes, I did.

1955
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:52,957
So a Canadian girl liked you
a lot on seeing that picture of yours.

1956
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:54,666
What? She liked me picture?

1957
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:57,750
But there is nothing to be happy about.

1958
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,375
There is a problem.

1959
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:00,416
Problem?

1960
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:01,791
Is the girl blind?

1961
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:05,000
No, no, she is fine where
that is concerned. - I see. Fine.

1962
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:06,458
Then there is no problem.

1963
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:09,166
But she has three conditions.

1964
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,250
Three conditions?

1965
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,500
What are they?

1966
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:13,916
The first one is that you
have to be live in son-in-law.

1967
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:14,916
Live in son-in-law?

1968
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,476
As soon as the alliance is finalized,
I can stay at the girl's house.

1969
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,708
But the second condition is very tough.

1970
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:21,750
Second condition is very tough?

1971
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:22,708
What is it?

1972
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:25,458
Actually she is the only
daughter of her parents.

1973
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,458
That is why she likes traveling.

1974
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,750
You have to take her to the
night club for dancing everyday.

1975
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:34,166
Never mind. If she so wishes,
I will take her to nightclub everyday.

1976
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:38,000
Wow. And third condition is..
- Let it be.

1977
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:40,125
Third or fourth.
Whatever her conditions might be.

1978
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:41,408
I am ready for her conditions.

1979
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:43,125
Ready? Wow. - Yes.

1980
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:45,415
This is great. Do something.

1981
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:49,458
Pack your bag and take tonight's
train and reach Toronto tomorrow.

1982
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:49,958
Yes.

1983
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:52,226
She will wait for you at
the station tomorrow in the morning.

1984
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,208
Do reach at ten in the morning for sure.

1985
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:55,832
Yes. Okay. - Don't be late at all.

1986
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:57,500
Tell me. What is the name of the girl?

1987
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:58,958
What?

1988
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:00,375
Name?

1989
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:02,916
Yes. Latika.

1990
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:06,540
Latika? But this is a Bengali name.

1991
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,916
Oh wow. She liked your photo so much..

1992
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
..that she changed
her name before marriage.

1993
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:14,458
From Lilantica to Latika.

1994
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:16,750
From Lilantica to Latika.

1995
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:18,583
From Latika to Lilantika.

1996
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,000
I have trapped the fool.

1997
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:33,791
Hey, fool.

1998
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:36,875
You are dancing here? And the
pulses are burning on the other side.

1999
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:38,458
Yes, now your fortune will burn.

2000
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:40,583
And then,
your restaurant will close down.

2001
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,500
Because the doors of
my fortune have opened up.

2002
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:46,500
I will give you one slap. - Hey, Hara.

2003
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:51,207
I am not Bhola from Canning anymore.
I am Mr. Bhola Das from Canada.

2004
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,750
Talk with respect.

2005
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,416
Your restaurant can go to hell.

2006
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,416
I am leaving. Yes.

2007
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,375
Hey, where are you going?

2008
01:24:58,458 --> 01:25:01,791
I will not tell you.
But if you trouble me.. - Hey.

2009
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:05,045
I am sure this is the
deed of that fighter woman.

2010
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:18,875
Excuse me. - Yes?

2011
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:20,000
Can I have chicken please?

2012
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,083
Yes, yes, yes.

2013
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:24,333
Here you are. Take this.

2014
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,767
If you use such a lot
of saliva to count money..

2015
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:28,809
..your tongue will dry up.

2016
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,083
Hey, don't cast an evil eye.

2017
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,291
Here you are. Keep five dollars.

2018
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:35,375
Oh God, it is wet with spit.

2019
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:36,778
Give it. Don't take it. - No, no.

2020
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:39,392
I will keep it covered with
a stone on the terrace. It will dry up.

2021
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:40,833
Listen, Madhu. - Yes?

2022
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:43,458
We have played a good move.

2023
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,250
Wait and watch.

2024
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:47,625
He wouldn't get a cook
in the whole of Canada.

2025
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:49,758
If he does,
I will get rid of the cook. - Yes.

2026
01:25:57,416 --> 01:25:59,541
I think the food is good..
- Let us go there.

2027
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:00,291
Sir. Hello.. - Hello!

2028
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:02,208
Please come here.. - That is nice.

2029
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:05,125
What is the matter?
Why is everyone going that side today?

2030
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:06,934
And we have been casting
away flies since morning.

2031
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:07,958
Parbati.

2032
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,250
We have to get her inside.

2033
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:10,541
Madam. - Madam.

2034
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:12,166
Madam. Come to the next one.

2035
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,832
We have made special menu today. -Yes.

2036
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:15,433
There is special pulses.
Raw banana dish.

2037
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,291
Yes. - The fried rice with nine herbs.

2038
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:17,291
Mango chutney.

2039
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:18,809
Yes. Chutney. - Please do come in.
You will get whatever you want.

2040
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:19,833
Come inside.
- Come inside.

2041
01:26:19,834 --> 01:26:21,083
Madam. - Yes?

2042
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:22,541
Why are you going that side?

2043
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,000
Good food is this side.

2044
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,790
I have made prawns with cream today.

2045
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,671
Come inside and check.
Everyone is relishing it.

2046
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:29,791
It is stale food kept for three days,
madam. - What?

2047
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,723
He is heating it and
feeding to customers.

2048
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,916
Oh my God.
What is it that she is saying?

2049
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:36,083
Why are you listening to her?

2050
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:38,541
I don't behave like her
and give leftovers...

2051
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,666
..with a new garnish
to new customers.

2052
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:43,083
Disgusting. Is that true?

2053
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:45,458
What do you do? Yes?

2054
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:49,875
He gives stale food to customers.
And sprays fragrance on the food.

2055
01:26:50,166 --> 01:26:52,101
So that they cannot get
the stale stench of the food.

2056
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:53,541
Oh my God.

2057
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,625
Call someone and ask as to why
she doesn't have customers in her shop.

2058
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,832
Two days back,
there was a strand of hair in curd fish.

2059
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:01,125
Forget about asking for
forgiveness from the customer.

2060
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:02,541
Do you know what he said?

2061
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:06,082
I have to tear off my hair
while looking for Hilsa fish. - What?

2062
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:07,458
Let it be. Let it be.

2063
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,892
I don't want to eat at anyone's
restaurant. - What? What is she saying?

2064
01:27:09,916 --> 01:27:12,208
I would rather go home
and boil pulses and rice at home.

2065
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:15,125
No. - Madam, listen to me. Listen to me.

2066
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:16,041
This happened because of you..

2067
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:18,666
If you say another word,
I will strangle you..

2068
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:19,767
Come on, teach him a lesson.

2069
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:22,541
Hey, give him one good thrashing.
- Hey, leave me.

2070
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:24,017
Come on, come on, shout. Shout more.

2071
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:25,184
Hey, hey, hey.. - Keep quiet.

2072
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:26,976
Leave him right now..
- Hey, who is this girl?

2073
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,040
Who is this? - Lowly goon.

2074
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:28,541
Don't you feel ashamed?

2075
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:29,832
Just because he is alone, you
are hitting a man of your father's age?

2076
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,625
Look at him.
I am in such a huge problem.

2077
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:33,184
He would have killed me if
you weren't there..- He should have.

2078
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:35,875
Don't worry about it.
I will take care of this monkey.

2079
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:37,392
I can see a lot of attitude in you.

2080
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:39,376
I thought you have packed
your bags and gone home.

2081
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,500
Why would I go home?

2082
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:43,767
The one who doesn't have a place to stay
and lives on the street has to go home.

2083
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:45,833
Hey, rural girl.
I don't stay on the streets.

2084
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:47,333
I live in a big compartment.

2085
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:49,083
Not compartment. Apartment.

2086
01:27:49,166 --> 01:27:50,666
Hey, forget your English.

2087
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,790
Listen, if you are hungry,
have food here and leave.

2088
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:53,833
She will not go anywhere.

2089
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:55,957
In fact, both of you should
pack your things and leave.

2090
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:56,708
Why? Why?

2091
01:27:56,916 --> 01:28:00,750
For your kind information,
she is my new family member. New cook.

2092
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:02,625
Cookie instead of cook?

2093
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:04,791
Hey, fool. A cookie means a biscuit.

2094
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:05,833
Hey, I know. I know.
I know everything.

2095
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:06,750
What do you know?

2096
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:09,313
Listen.. - Leave it, Hara. Leave it.
Come on. Let us go inside.

2097
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,458
Don't fight with these
lowly people.. - What?

2098
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:12,958
And ruin our goodwill.. - Yes.

2099
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:14,309
And in any case,
customers are waiting for us.

2100
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:19,041
Hey, hey.. - Hey, get lost. Get lost.

2101
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,875
..I am falling into
one trouble after the other.

2102
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:35,791
Firstly, I lost all my money.

2103
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:38,916
And then, I even lost the
house I used to stay on rent.

2104
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,375
I don't have a place to stay now.

2105
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,083
What shall I do?
I cannot understand anything.

2106
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:46,750
Lord has made a way for everyone.

2107
01:28:47,666 --> 01:28:51,041
And there are moments of
sadness and happiness on the way.

2108
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:54,708
Serve Lord with all your heart, dear.
Everything will be fine.

2109
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,791
Oh yes. Did you get offerings?

2110
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,125
No. - I will give it.

2111
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,958
Hey, who is it? Come here.

2112
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,375
What? - Even he was
in a condition like yours.

2113
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:08,333
He didn't have a place to stay.
He slept all night on the street.

2114
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:09,958
I let him stay here.

2115
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:14,250
He works.
And serves Lord in his spare time.

2116
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:17,541
Madhu, take her. Give her offerings.

2117
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:23,208
Where is it? Your compartment.

2118
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:24,541
One where you stayed alone?

2119
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:26,958
It isn't a compartment.
It is an apartment.

2120
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:28,976
It will take some time.
It is getting painted.

2121
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Liar.

2122
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,166
Come on, I will give you offerings.

2123
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:41,500
Oh no, I found a place for me.
And she has come here too.

2124
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:47,166
Hello.
- How are you? Tell me.

2125
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:50,000
Don't ask me. I have to cook all day.

2126
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,684
Now I have to go to take
care of the restaurant now.

2127
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:52,250
What is it?

2128
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:53,875
You are still in the restaurant?

2129
01:29:54,166 --> 01:29:56,833
No, no, I have left it long back.

2130
01:29:56,916 --> 01:29:58,017
Now I will go to eat at the restaurant.

2131
01:29:58,041 --> 01:29:58,708
Excuse me.

2132
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:00,541
Do you know where the train station is?

2133
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:01,291
Yes.

2134
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:02,934
Do you have your girlfriend with you?

2135
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:04,083
Where is it?

2136
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:05,958
Yes, yes.

2137
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:08,125
What a weirdo!

2138
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:10,500
What are you saying, brother?

2139
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:11,250
What?

2140
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:13,142
Now girls have such a lot of demands.

2141
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:14,832
She said she wants to watch
a movie and then, have food.

2142
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,916
Yes, yes, Madhu. Come on, go for it.

2143
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:20,041
Okay, okay, hang up now.
My driver has come with the car.

2144
01:30:20,375 --> 01:30:21,375
I will talk later.

2145
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:23,541
Listen. - What?

2146
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:25,642
Madhu has gone there and
seeing a foreigner woman there.

2147
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:26,125
What?

2148
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:27,851
He wasn't getting a job here
because he had failed his tenth exams.

2149
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:29,666
And there, he has got a foreigner woman.

2150
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,083
How did he do it?

2151
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:33,500
Hey, he had a lot
of internal connections.

2152
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:35,291
I see.
- His father knows a lot of people.

2153
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:36,958
He made some recommendations and..

2154
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:39,226
..got his son to have an
affair with a foreigner's daughter.

2155
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:40,958
You are right.

2156
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:43,916
I need salt.

2157
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:47,708
Oh no. Salt is over.

2158
01:30:58,541 --> 01:30:59,541
Rural girl.

2159
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:02,000
What do you want?

2160
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:03,458
I don't want anything.

2161
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:05,250
I came to find out about you.

2162
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:08,415
Hey, dear. Only a Bengali will take
care of a Bengali in a foreign land.

2163
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,708
And then, we are neighbors.

2164
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:12,208
Now we will continue fighting.

2165
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,375
Now I wanted to say..

2166
01:31:17,666 --> 01:31:20,250
Meaning if you ever need something..

2167
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,833
..do ask me for it.

2168
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:24,291
Okay? Now it could be oil,
rice or pulses.

2169
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:26,250
Vegetables. And yes, even salt.

2170
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:29,957
If you need salt, do ask me for it.
Don't hesitate.

2171
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:32,125
I don't want anything. - Not even salt?

2172
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:33,375
No.

2173
01:31:33,458 --> 01:31:38,125
Not even salt.
- But I do want it, rural girl.

2174
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:05,375
The left one is 18. And the right is 17.

2175
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:07,125
Hey, has it become less?

2176
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:14,625
You were right.

2177
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:17,166
Only a Bengali can take care
of a Bengali in a foreign land.

2178
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,208
Now suppose if you need something.

2179
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,500
Like corn flour is over.

2180
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,750
Or while going to lock
the door of the restaurant..

2181
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:25,708
..you saw that the key isn't working.

2182
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,166
You can tell me in that case.

2183
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,625
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

2184
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:30,332
I saw something.

2185
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:32,208
You girls are very smart.

2186
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:34,618
You can tell me directly
that you cannot lock the door.

2187
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:36,625
Why are you beating around the bush,
rural girl?

2188
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:39,333
So even you could have
said directly that you need salt.

2189
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:41,016
Why did you beat
around the bush, monkey?

2190
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:46,375
Here you are.

2191
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:51,881
I was thinking that there could
be differences between Hara and Parbati.

2192
01:32:52,791 --> 01:32:54,833
Let us not fight anymore.

2193
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,083
Right?

2194
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:59,666
Yes. I mean both of
us can help each other.

2195
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,416
Yes. You are right.

2196
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:04,541
Ria. - Yes?

2197
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:10,375
I wanted to say that
if I say good night to you..

2198
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:11,958
..would you have a problem?

2199
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:14,833
No.

2200
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,083
Good night.

2201
01:33:17,708 --> 01:33:18,750
Good night.

2202
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:21,833
Good night. Okay?

2203
01:33:22,166 --> 01:33:23,291
Good night. - Yes.

2204
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:39,375
I don't think the bus will come today.

2205
01:33:39,666 --> 01:33:42,666
If the bus doesn't come,
you will get late.

2206
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,880
If the bus doesn't come,
even you will get late.

2207
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,541
Yes. That is right.

2208
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:49,458
Hey, do you want to go by taxi?
By sharing?

2209
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,892
If they see us getting down together..

2210
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:52,875
..both of us will lose our jobs.

2211
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:55,333
Okay.

2212
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:56,696
We will get down a little ahead.

2213
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:06,958
Okay. Miss Ria. Tell me something.

2214
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:08,696
I agree I am in a bad condition.

2215
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:10,833
That is why I am compelled
to cook in a hotel.

2216
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:13,208
But why did you have
to take up a job of a cook?

2217
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:15,791
Even I am not in a good condition.
Or else..

2218
01:34:15,875 --> 01:34:17,434
..no one would work as
a cook in a foreign country..

2219
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:18,791
..when one has come to study.

2220
01:34:21,291 --> 01:34:23,583
Okay, Madhu. Tell me something.

2221
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,250
Have you spoken to Jenny lately?
- Have you lost your mind?

2222
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:28,892
I don't go that way even by mistake.

2223
01:34:28,916 --> 01:34:30,541
You haven't behaved well with her.

2224
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:32,473
You should ask for
forgiveness from Jenny.

2225
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:33,541
What?

2226
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:34,905
Why would I ask for forgiveness?

2227
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:36,731
Now the entire fault is mine, right?

2228
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:40,166
You didn't do anything.
Who was the one to instigate me? - What?

2229
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:41,083
Who told me?

2230
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:44,208
Madhu, get married to Jenny.
You will get a permanent ration card.

2231
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:45,208
You are good looking.

2232
01:34:45,291 --> 01:34:47,250
I told you and you agreed with me.

2233
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:50,041
Haven't you seen yourself in the mirror?
Good looking.

2234
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:51,875
God made you with his left hand.

2235
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,540
You look like a lowly person.

2236
01:34:53,541 --> 01:34:55,166
So even you are not good looking either.

2237
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,184
You will never get married ever.
No girl would ever marry you.

2238
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:58,688
Wait and watch. - Are you cursing me?

2239
01:34:58,750 --> 01:34:59,791
Yes. I am.

2240
01:34:59,875 --> 01:35:00,458
Brother.

2241
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:02,351
Stop the car.
- No. The car wouldn't stop.

2242
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:03,208
Keep driving, driver.

2243
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:04,517
Didn't you hear what I said?
- No, don't stop.

2244
01:35:04,541 --> 01:35:05,934
You keep driving.
- I don't want to go with her.

2245
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:06,833
Why are you fighting with each other?
- Just keep driving.

2246
01:35:06,916 --> 01:35:07,958
Stop. - Monkey.

2247
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:08,625
Don't go. -Go.

2248
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:10,716
I am asking you to stop.
- Get out of the car.

2249
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,958
She is a lowly person. You follow
me everywhere. - I didn't do anything.

2250
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:15,958
You did it too. Got it?

2251
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:17,499
Don't talk too much. - I was right
in doing so. Get lost. - Ten dollars.

2252
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,583
I am giving it. Wait.

2253
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:22,559
Here you are. Give him the rest.

2254
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:23,583
I am giving it.

2255
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:33,666
Rice tastes really nice.

2256
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:35,041
What did you say?

2257
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,208
I didn't understand.

2258
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:40,875
The job profile of a boy doesn't matter.
His heart should be good.

2259
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:42,375
Just like yours.

2260
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:45,166
Friends.

2261
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:48,583
No, no, no, never.

2262
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,708
I am not falling for your lies again.

2263
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:54,833
Tell me the truth. I cannot be cheated
of five dollars right in the morning.

2264
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,875
Not five dollars. One dollar.

2265
01:35:56,958 --> 01:35:58,375
I am short of one dollar.

2266
01:35:58,458 --> 01:35:59,707
Please. Give it.

2267
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:00,583
After all..

2268
01:36:00,666 --> 01:36:02,415
..if a Bengali doesn't look after a
Bengali in a foreign country, who will?

2269
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:03,416
Tell me.

2270
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:08,291
You mean to say that I have
to give a loan of one dollar, right?

2271
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:11,583
Okay, I can pay. But on one condition.

2272
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:13,601
You have to make a promise
of giving it back to me.

2273
01:36:13,625 --> 01:36:15,351
Yes, yes. I will give.
I will give everything back.

2274
01:36:15,375 --> 01:36:16,041
I swear on you.

2275
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:17,583
Will you remember?

2276
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:20,250
Here you are, uncle.

2277
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:29,833
Thank you. - Welcome.

2278
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:36,041
Okay. You told me in the taxi
that I look like over boiled rice.

2279
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,733
Did you say that in a fit of anger?

2280
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,083
That means the real truth
is what you said earlier.

2281
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:42,000
Absolutely.

2282
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,124
Wow. Meaning I look great.

2283
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:44,125
Great.

2284
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:48,666
It will do. - Monkey.

2285
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:50,750
Liar.

2286
01:36:50,833 --> 01:36:51,833
She is still lying to me.

2287
01:36:54,083 --> 01:36:55,963
Hey, there is a customer.
- There is a customer.

2288
01:36:56,166 --> 01:36:58,833
Let me go and get hold of him.
- Come on. Get hold of him.

2289
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:00,750
I am not here to eat, guys.

2290
01:37:00,916 --> 01:37:02,684
Sir. We have made flat
bread with filling today. -Yes.

2291
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,184
Yes, delicious potato curry. - Yes, yes.

2292
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:06,375
Well, I am looking for Haranath Das.

2293
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:07,666
Myself Haranath, sir.

2294
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:08,750
Good food.

2295
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,832
Parbati Shashmal. - Yes, sir.
I am the one, sir. Present, please.

2296
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:14,416
Well, guys, I am here to
inform you on the behalf of my bank.

2297
01:37:14,666 --> 01:37:17,250
The bank loan is pending
for the last six months.

2298
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:19,749
Now if you don't pay in 30 days..

2299
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,950
..I am sorry to say that
we have to cease your property.

2300
01:37:22,916 --> 01:37:25,041
Is that clear to both of you?

2301
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:29,000
Now sir, I want your signature here.

2302
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:30,375
Right here, sir.

2303
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:31,541
What does he want to eat?

2304
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:32,833
Thank you.

2305
01:37:32,958 --> 01:37:34,166
Ma'am. Yours.

2306
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:36,666
Right here.

2307
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:41,666
Thank you. Now here is the notice.

2308
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:42,875
Have a good day.

2309
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,875
What is this?

2310
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,400
Did he ask to send the food to him?

2311
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:52,916
What is the case?

2312
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,605
Now there is another trouble brewing.

2313
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:05,125
I had thought that I will
come to Canada and get married.

2314
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
And now, forget about marrying. I am
tired of getting rid of these troubles.

2315
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,958
When they had taken the loan..

2316
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:13,583
..both of them had an affair.

2317
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:15,458
Both of them had one restaurant.

2318
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:18,041
And now, both of them
are always at loggerheads.

2319
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:21,101
It has been six months
since they paid any installment.

2320
01:38:21,125 --> 01:38:23,958
Now within a month,
if they cannot pay the bank loan..

2321
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:25,500
..this hotel will close down.

2322
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,958
And we will lose our jobs too.

2323
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,375
Crap.

2324
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,250
We..

2325
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:39,958
Whenever we are in trouble,
we get into it together.

2326
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:42,083
You are laughing?

2327
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,750
Have you thought of what
will happen if we lose our jobs?

2328
01:38:46,375 --> 01:38:49,041
That is also true. Okay.

2329
01:38:50,041 --> 01:38:53,541
In order to save our jobs,
they have to pay off the loan.

2330
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,666
But one person cannot pay it off alone.

2331
01:39:00,166 --> 01:39:03,375
Both of them have to be reunited. Yes.

2332
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,958
Right. Great idea!

2333
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,083
Isn't it? - Absolutely.

2334
01:39:10,166 --> 01:39:11,642
That is why I say that only
a Bengali...

2335
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:13,666
can take care of
a Bengali in a foreign country.

2336
01:39:25,541 --> 01:39:27,226
If people see us sitting
together like this..

2337
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:30,125
..people will think that two beggars
are sitting here to beg for alms.

2338
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:33,416
Actually..

2339
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:37,125
I wanted to say something to you.

2340
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:43,333
Both of us shook hands normally.
I mean like friends.

2341
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,583
Yes. Yes.

2342
01:39:44,666 --> 01:39:46,250
Meaning even I was thinking of that.

2343
01:39:46,333 --> 01:39:48,958
We will not think of
these small matters seriously.

2344
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:49,875
Okay.

2345
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:51,517
As I will get married
and stay back here.

2346
01:39:51,541 --> 01:39:53,041
You will go back to the country.

2347
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:03,208
Your..

2348
01:40:03,333 --> 01:40:05,750
I owe you a dollar.

2349
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:08,166
I see. Yes. That is right.

2350
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:10,958
I was thinking that I have
forgotten to say something to you.

2351
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:13,791
Do remember to give it. Okay?
Don't forget. Okay.

2352
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,958
I am leaving.

2353
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:21,541
Good night.
- Good night.

2354
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:23,375
Good night.

2355
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:43,375
You saved me. In some more time,
I would have been afflicted.

2356
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:51,750
Thank God the matter
was done away with right here.

2357
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:53,725
Or else, I would have been in a problem.

2358
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:57,915
Couldn't you think of something else?

2359
01:40:57,916 --> 01:40:59,226
You have come to give me an advice?

2360
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:00,809
You want to me to unite
with that fighter woman.

2361
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:05,958
And hug her. When she crosses my path,
I feel a cat has crossed my path.

2362
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:10,875
I know that Parbati is a bit like a cat.
She isn't that beauty fall.

2363
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Not beauty fall. Beautiful.

2364
01:41:13,375 --> 01:41:14,500
Hey, whatever it is.

2365
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:16,559
But don't you think it is better
to have a fighter cat at the door..

2366
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:17,875
..than a bank notice at home?

2367
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:18,958
Isn't it? - No.

2368
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:21,166
Bank notice is way better than a cat.

2369
01:41:22,208 --> 01:41:25,290
Has the bank sent a notice to me alone?
The notice has gone to him too.

2370
01:41:25,291 --> 01:41:27,041
I would prefer to
remain mute all my life..

2371
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:28,583
..than to talk to a person like him.

2372
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:32,625
But what happened between the two
of you? Why did the two of you separate?

2373
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,083
That fool fell for a foreigner woman.

2374
01:41:35,666 --> 01:41:37,333
The girl used to supply vegetables here.

2375
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,684
She came and spoke to
him with a smile for two days.

2376
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:43,000
And God. He fell head
over heels in love with her.

2377
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,963
And then, he used to
let that fool eat for free.

2378
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:47,541
That is it. Even I caught hold of him.

2379
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:51,333
And not just feeding her.
- What else did he do?

2380
01:41:51,416 --> 01:41:53,916
I did give her 420 betel leaf to her.

2381
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,875
So what was the big deal about it?

2382
01:41:56,208 --> 01:41:59,582
Oh no. This was a very sad case.

2383
01:41:59,583 --> 01:42:01,783
But there is something
that is making me confused, Hara.

2384
01:42:01,916 --> 01:42:04,166
Oh no, that is not the correct word.
Confused.

2385
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:05,250
Hey, whatever it is.

2386
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:07,958
I do lose my mind when it
comes to understanding English.

2387
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:11,375
But you fell for that English woman's
English and gave her a betel leaf?

2388
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:13,666
Hey, the problem was
because I didn't understand.

2389
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,582
She used to come and tell me.
I love my hubby.

2390
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:17,750
I love my hubby.

2391
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,750
I didn't know that hubby means husband.

2392
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:21,541
I thought she is
heavily in love with me.

2393
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:23,585
That is it.
I made separate hotels since that day.

2394
01:42:24,583 --> 01:42:25,708
Parbati.

2395
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:27,416
All men are the same.

2396
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:29,476
As long as their women
for home are fixed..

2397
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,333
..they look for their options elsewhere.

2398
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:33,958
But it is our responsibility
to take care of men.

2399
01:42:34,625 --> 01:42:36,916
Don't keep your possessions
lying outside for a long time.

2400
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:38,166
Take it up.

2401
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,166
Forgive Hara and.. - Never.

2402
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:42,291
I cannot forgive a
characterless man like him ever.

2403
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,140
It would be better
for you to forgive him.

2404
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:47,000
Or else, your prized
hotel will go to the bank.

2405
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:50,583
And Hara will go to the foreigner woman.

2406
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:52,833
Look, Hara.
This isn't going to benefit me.

2407
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,125
But if you don't unite with Parbati..

2408
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:57,166
..you will be in trouble. Pig.

2409
01:42:58,583 --> 01:42:59,750
Not that. The word is sure.

2410
01:42:59,833 --> 01:43:02,073
Hey, whatever it is.
But you will be in trouble for sure.

2411
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:05,416
Okay.

2412
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:06,958
Whatever you say.

2413
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:08,291
Come on. - No, I will not go.

2414
01:43:08,375 --> 01:43:10,226
Come on. I am telling you.
- Come on. Come with me.

2415
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:13,916
No. Leave me.
I don't want to go. -Come with me.

2416
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:16,833
Tell me.

2417
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:18,916
Say sorry.

2418
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:22,625
Sorry. - Okay.

2419
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:25,750
Yes. - That is great.

2420
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:27,875
Hara Parbati be.. - Hailed.

2421
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:46,583
"Hey, Babu(sir). Babu."

2422
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,583
"Hey, Babu(sir). Babu."

2423
01:44:02,625 --> 01:44:04,416
"Bengali Babu."

2424
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,250
"Hey, Babu(sir). Babu."

2425
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:22,250
"Bengali Babu."

2426
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:39,916
"Hey, Babu(sir). Babu."

2427
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:43,291
"Bengali Babu."

2428
01:44:46,875 --> 01:44:48,500
"Hey, Babu(sir). Babu."

2429
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:50,333
"Bengali Babu."

2430
01:44:50,625 --> 01:44:52,208
"Hey, Babu(sir). Babu."

2431
01:45:11,541 --> 01:45:12,791
Mother.
- Ria.

2432
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:14,828
Where did you get hurt? Yes?

2433
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:16,375
Where?

2434
01:45:24,083 --> 01:45:25,083
One minute.

2435
01:45:35,333 --> 01:45:36,333
Here you are.

2436
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:39,333
I am leaving. - Go carefully.

2437
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:41,541
Yes. - Ria.

2438
01:45:42,666 --> 01:45:45,250
I was saying that this is a
foreign country. And you are a girl.

2439
01:45:45,541 --> 01:45:47,207
Thirdly, it is night.
And fourth, you are hurt.

2440
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:48,500
Come on, I will drop you.

2441
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:51,000
No, no, I will be able to go.

2442
01:45:51,916 --> 01:45:54,000
In any case, you have done a lot for me.

2443
01:45:54,708 --> 01:45:55,958
Who will do if not me?

2444
01:45:56,041 --> 01:45:57,291
And who else do you have here?

2445
01:45:57,375 --> 01:46:00,215
Hey, only a Bengali can take care
of a Bengali in a foreign land. Right?

2446
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:02,010
Come on, I will drop you.
Come on.. - No, no.

2447
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:04,125
I will go.

2448
01:46:04,708 --> 01:46:05,708
Sure.

2449
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:10,041
Okay. Call me when you reach. - Okay.

2450
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:16,833
Hey. Ria.

2451
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:17,583
Did you get hurt?

2452
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:18,666
Yes?

2453
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:20,333
I told you I will drop you.

2454
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:22,541
Here you are. Come on. Come on.

2455
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Careful. - Yes.

2456
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,791
Thank you. - Don't worry.

2457
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:40,833
"We meet time and again."

2458
01:46:40,916 --> 01:46:44,083
"Why does she turn
around and look at me?"

2459
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:49,500
"I don't get sleep.
And the day doesn't go by."

2460
01:46:51,041 --> 01:46:54,083
"I am listening to it all day."

2461
01:46:54,291 --> 01:46:57,166
"I can hear her words all of a sudden."

2462
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:02,250
"My heart cannot take it.
I cannot wake up from sleep."

2463
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:11,125
"Why do I feel this
restlessness in my heart?"

2464
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:18,916
"What is the reason because
of which there is sadness in my heart?"

2465
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:21,875
"Is this love?"

2466
01:47:22,166 --> 01:47:26,041
"Or is it a time for
getting nothing in return?"

2467
01:47:26,916 --> 01:47:28,500
"Is this love?"

2468
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:32,750
"Or is it a time to
spend nights without sleep?"

2469
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:35,249
"Is this love?"

2470
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:40,041
"Or is it a time for
getting nothing in return?"

2471
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,166
"Is this love?"

2472
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:46,166
"Or is it a time to
spend nights without sleep?"

2473
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:16,750
"Why do I feel this
restlessness in my heart?"

2474
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:23,708
"What is the reason because
of which there is sadness in my heart?"

2475
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:28,041
"Is this love?"

2476
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:31,833
"Or is it a time for
getting nothing in return?"

2477
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,416
"Is this love?"

2478
01:48:34,833 --> 01:48:38,708
"Or is it a time to
spend nights without sleep?"

2479
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:46,000
"When you are with me or close to me."

2480
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:49,291
"I am incapable of
thinking anything else."

2481
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:54,250
"I don't care about people.
Or about anyone."

2482
01:48:56,333 --> 01:48:59,833
"I have so many secret words to say."

2483
01:48:59,916 --> 01:49:02,625
"There are so many signs
that come out of your eyes."

2484
01:49:02,708 --> 01:49:09,375
"Your look is wounding my
heart and meting out injustice."

2485
01:49:10,333 --> 01:49:16,541
"Why do I have this intoxication now?"

2486
01:49:17,416 --> 01:49:23,666
"Why is the heart thinking
of a future with you?"

2487
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:27,083
"Is this love?"

2488
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:31,833
"Or is it a time for
getting nothing in return?"

2489
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:33,958
"Is this love?"

2490
01:49:34,041 --> 01:49:38,083
"Or is it a time to
spend nights without sleep?"

2491
01:49:51,166 --> 01:49:52,166
Be careful.

2492
01:49:53,166 --> 01:49:54,166
Watch your step.

2493
01:49:55,041 --> 01:49:56,041
Yes, be careful.

2494
01:50:05,666 --> 01:50:06,666
Ria.

2495
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:14,101
Isn't this a surprise for you?

2496
01:50:14,125 --> 01:50:15,125
Bikram.

2497
01:50:15,833 --> 01:50:16,833
You are here?

2498
01:50:17,458 --> 01:50:18,916
I took a flight to Vancouver.

2499
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,000
I thought of meeting you once.

2500
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Did I trouble you?

2501
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:25,333
No, no. Not at all.

2502
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:28,583
He is Madhu.

2503
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:29,833
He is my friend.

2504
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,958
And he is Bikram.

2505
01:50:33,916 --> 01:50:34,916
My fianc�.

2506
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:41,583
Hi. Captain Bikram Sen.

2507
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:46,875
I am only Madhusudan Dutta.

2508
01:50:47,125 --> 01:50:48,125
Only?

2509
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:56,538
What happened to your foot?

2510
01:50:57,833 --> 01:50:59,166
I got hurt at work.

2511
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:02,208
That is why Madhu came to drop me.

2512
01:51:02,541 --> 01:51:03,958
You have changed so much, Ria.

2513
01:51:04,583 --> 01:51:05,934
You have been in such a lot of problem.

2514
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:07,598
And yet,
you didn't let me know even once?

2515
01:51:07,708 --> 01:51:08,375
Problem?

2516
01:51:08,458 --> 01:51:09,458
What else?

2517
01:51:09,583 --> 01:51:10,375
I followed the address of
the earlier place...

2518
01:51:10,458 --> 01:51:11,726
you were staying at and went there.

2519
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:13,750
I heard you were sharing
a room with a boy.

2520
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:15,934
No, I mean.. - I mean..
- No, no, captain sir.

2521
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:17,791
That boy is no one else. It is me.

2522
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:20,166
We were like enemies there.

2523
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,291
Don't think otherwise about it.

2524
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:25,916
I am not thinking anyway, Mr.
Only Madhusudan Dutta.

2525
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,750
Yes.

2526
01:51:26,791 --> 01:51:28,671
And apart from that,
Ria is my childhood friend.

2527
01:51:28,708 --> 01:51:30,041
I know her very well.

2528
01:51:30,541 --> 01:51:32,958
Childhood friend?
And yet, you are marrying her?

2529
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:34,916
Hey, will you keep quiet? - Oh no.

2530
01:51:35,291 --> 01:51:37,000
When two intelligent
people are talking..

2531
01:51:37,083 --> 01:51:38,833
..a fool shouldn't interrupt.

2532
01:51:39,291 --> 01:51:40,375
Captain sir. - Yes?

2533
01:51:40,583 --> 01:51:42,583
I have come here to
marry a Canadian girl.

2534
01:51:42,666 --> 01:51:44,586
If you want to get married
to a foreigner woman..

2535
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:48,000
..do tell me. It isn't a big
deal to get a white skinned girl here.

2536
01:51:48,291 --> 01:51:50,750
Why just white?
Black, white, blue, green, yellow.

2537
01:51:50,833 --> 01:51:52,083
No girl would marry you.

2538
01:51:52,958 --> 01:51:54,875
Your face is so ugly.

2539
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,041
Cannot you speak nicely, rural girl?

2540
01:51:57,208 --> 01:51:57,875
Keep quiet now.

2541
01:51:57,958 --> 01:51:59,892
You keep quiet. - Okay, one minute.
One minute. One minute.

2542
01:51:59,916 --> 01:52:01,796
You don't have to find
a foreigner woman for me.

2543
01:52:01,916 --> 01:52:03,392
And you don't have
to fight with her either.

2544
01:52:03,416 --> 01:52:05,750
In any case, I am going
back to India with her day after.

2545
01:52:06,958 --> 01:52:09,166
Day after? - So soon?

2546
01:52:09,458 --> 01:52:11,125
Yes. Her course is complete.

2547
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:13,811
And our wedding date has been
fixed which is one month from now.

2548
01:52:14,208 --> 01:52:17,416
I have been given the responsibility of
getting the bride back to the country.

2549
01:52:22,625 --> 01:52:23,865
Congratulations on the wedding.

2550
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:25,833
Take care.

2551
01:52:26,416 --> 01:52:27,416
Thank you.

2552
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,750
Will you excuse me for two minutes?

2553
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:33,541
Let me freshen up.
We will have coffee after that.

2554
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:34,791
Sure.

2555
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:44,000
Congress for the wedding.

2556
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:46,708
Not Congress.

2557
01:52:49,125 --> 01:52:50,208
The word is congrats.

2558
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:54,625
So I shall leave.

2559
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:56,333
No, I mean..

2560
01:52:57,583 --> 01:52:58,666
I wanted to say..

2561
01:53:00,125 --> 01:53:01,333
Have coffee before leaving.

2562
01:53:04,125 --> 01:53:07,208
It will be very late.
We will meet tomorrow.

2563
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:19,778
Are you coming for work tomorrow?

2564
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:22,582
"Lord."

2565
01:53:22,583 --> 01:53:23,708
I think I cannot.

2566
01:53:23,875 --> 01:53:24,958
"My Lord."

2567
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,416
I have to do the packing.

2568
01:53:29,958 --> 01:53:30,958
So?

2569
01:53:31,875 --> 01:53:33,250
That means we wouldn't meet?

2570
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,625
"Lord."

2571
01:53:46,833 --> 01:53:52,458
"Why does the day
to lose you come closer?"

2572
01:53:52,875 --> 01:53:58,791
"Why does the day to
lose sight of you come close?"

2573
01:53:58,875 --> 01:54:00,291
"Some people get it."

2574
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:01,833
"And heart goes back."

2575
01:54:01,916 --> 01:54:05,250
"Into your dreams again."

2576
01:54:05,333 --> 01:54:10,500
"Hey, my heart is sad."

2577
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:16,041
"Where will you leave it alone and go?"

2578
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:21,916
"Hey, I am very sad."

2579
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:27,375
"Hey, my friend. Come back."

2580
01:54:54,125 --> 01:54:55,291
She has gone back, Bipasha.

2581
01:54:57,291 --> 01:54:58,291
She will go.

2582
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:00,583
She didn't come here to stay.

2583
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:05,083
Let her go. It is good in one way.

2584
01:55:06,208 --> 01:55:08,248
I haven't dreamt of a
foreigner woman since so long.

2585
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,640
From now on,
I will dream of one everyday.

2586
01:55:15,083 --> 01:55:16,083
But..

2587
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:18,625
But the problem is that..

2588
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:23,250
No.

2589
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:27,750
There is no problem. Everything is fine.

2590
01:55:35,041 --> 01:55:37,125
But I cannot understand something.

2591
01:55:39,208 --> 01:55:41,166
Who will I address as
rural flower from now on?

2592
01:55:41,458 --> 01:55:47,500
"While smiling,
the flowers have gone dry today."

2593
01:55:47,583 --> 01:55:53,040
"They are gone. They have faded.
The colors of yesterday."

2594
01:55:53,041 --> 01:55:58,958
"I had so many things to say to you.
I didn't say them to you."

2595
01:55:59,041 --> 01:56:04,333
"The surroundings feel so lonely.
This isn't my country."

2596
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:10,708
"Now. Let me go back
to your dreams again."

2597
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:15,707
"Hey, my heart is sad."

2598
01:56:15,708 --> 01:56:20,583
"Where will you leave it alone and go?"

2599
01:56:20,958 --> 01:56:27,500
"Hey, I am very sad."

2600
01:56:27,666 --> 01:56:32,083
"Hey, my friend. Come back."

2601
01:57:10,791 --> 01:57:16,750
"With you,
there was a shower of happiness around."

2602
01:57:16,833 --> 01:57:22,333
"Why is there sadness today?"

2603
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:27,999
"Both of us have picked
up kites in the evening."

2604
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,375
"Come back. Come back.
Both of us will be together again."

2605
01:57:33,416 --> 01:57:39,541
"Come on.
Let us go back to your dreams again."

2606
01:57:39,625 --> 01:57:44,833
"Hey, my heart is sad."

2607
01:57:45,083 --> 01:57:50,083
"Where will you leave it alone and go?"

2608
01:57:51,625 --> 01:57:56,625
"Hey, I am very sad."

2609
01:57:57,083 --> 01:58:02,416
"Hey, my friend. Come back."

2610
01:58:06,458 --> 01:58:08,958
Okay, what is the name
of the son of your uncle?

2611
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:09,916
Sunanda.

2612
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:10,708
Sunanda.

2613
01:58:10,916 --> 01:58:13,000
I cannot remember this name.

2614
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:14,875
Listen. - Yes?

2615
01:58:15,541 --> 01:58:17,625
Which sari should I
keep for Bikram's mother?

2616
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:19,166
This one or this one?

2617
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:20,833
You are showing a sari to me?

2618
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:23,601
Ask me the brand of good liquor.
I will be able to tell you.

2619
01:58:23,625 --> 01:58:25,166
Show the sari to Ria.

2620
01:58:25,875 --> 01:58:27,791
See it, dear. Which one should I keep?

2621
01:58:28,291 --> 01:58:31,416
Keep the one that you like, mother.

2622
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:35,041
What has happened to you?

2623
01:58:35,666 --> 01:58:38,291
I have noticed since the time
you have come back. You seem lost.

2624
01:58:38,625 --> 01:58:41,666
It is your wedding. And yet, you seem
to be away from all the preparations.

2625
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,458
What has happened? Tell me.

2626
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,250
What..

2627
01:58:46,125 --> 01:58:47,333
Nothing..
It is nothing.

2628
01:58:47,416 --> 01:58:48,736
I am sure something has happened.

2629
01:58:48,833 --> 01:58:51,114
We have been buying things
for the marriage since so long.

2630
01:58:51,458 --> 01:58:55,291
You didn't fight with me
even once about choosing the saris.

2631
01:58:56,208 --> 01:58:59,291
Whatever you buy will be good.
Right, mother?

2632
01:58:59,833 --> 01:59:01,313
You will get married after some days.

2633
01:59:01,708 --> 01:59:04,916
If you are happy, you can
keep everyone happy at your in-laws'.

2634
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,166
No, no, don't worry about the in-laws.

2635
01:59:08,041 --> 01:59:09,641
I just have something to tell you, dear.

2636
01:59:10,208 --> 01:59:12,541
Don't go away from your father
with any pain in your heart.

2637
01:59:12,958 --> 01:59:13,958
Okay?

2638
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Okay.

2639
01:59:23,916 --> 01:59:27,125
"Listen, my good son.
Come close. Come close. Come close."

2640
01:59:27,208 --> 01:59:29,166
"Come close."

2641
01:59:30,416 --> 01:59:31,250
Hello.

2642
01:59:31,416 --> 01:59:32,416
Hello.

2643
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:34,958
Rural girl? You?

2644
01:59:35,208 --> 01:59:36,333
It is me.

2645
01:59:38,375 --> 01:59:39,416
How are you?

2646
01:59:39,625 --> 01:59:41,791
I am fine. How are you?

2647
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:43,583
Okay..

2648
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:47,791
I thought of letting you know.

2649
01:59:49,166 --> 01:59:52,750
I am getting married on the next 15th.

2650
01:59:58,625 --> 02:00:00,385
Aren't you getting
married a little too soon?

2651
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:02,805
You could have got
married after some time.

2652
02:00:04,333 --> 02:00:05,333
Why?

2653
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,440
What would have happened if
I did get married after some days?

2654
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:09,958
That is right.

2655
02:00:10,958 --> 02:00:13,318
What would have happened
if you did wait for some more time?

2656
02:00:13,583 --> 02:00:15,623
Why should one wait when
one has got a good choice..

2657
02:00:16,041 --> 02:00:17,481
..where a life partner is concerned?

2658
02:00:23,375 --> 02:00:24,416
Okay.

2659
02:00:25,291 --> 02:00:28,958
Tell me something.
Aren't you missing me?

2660
02:00:31,583 --> 02:00:32,791
Why would I miss you?

2661
02:00:34,083 --> 02:00:35,833
I have Bipasha to talk to.

2662
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:39,000
And then, I am dreaming
of new foreigner women everyday.

2663
02:00:40,125 --> 02:00:41,125
Why should I miss you?

2664
02:00:42,625 --> 02:00:43,625
Okay.

2665
02:00:44,625 --> 02:00:46,333
You are missing me. Right?

2666
02:00:46,583 --> 02:00:47,583
Miss?

2667
02:00:48,125 --> 02:00:49,750
A monkey like you?

2668
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,583
Not at all.

2669
02:00:55,291 --> 02:00:56,375
Then why did you call me?

2670
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:57,916
That was..

2671
02:00:59,208 --> 02:01:01,708
That was because I
remember all of a sudden..

2672
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:03,850
..that I have to give one dollar to you.

2673
02:01:04,333 --> 02:01:07,208
That is why I thought I will
pay off all the debts before marriage.

2674
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,500
I see.

2675
02:01:09,541 --> 02:01:11,416
So you have called to repay the debt.

2676
02:01:12,875 --> 02:01:13,875
Okay.

2677
02:01:14,125 --> 02:01:15,332
Don't worry about that.

2678
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:16,583
You are..

2679
02:01:16,916 --> 02:01:19,125
You always fight with me.

2680
02:01:19,458 --> 02:01:22,083
Please. At least don't
fight with me today.

2681
02:01:22,166 --> 02:01:24,500
I didn't start the fight.
You started it.

2682
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:27,041
And I will finish it. Yes.

2683
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:30,125
Come on. I write off all your debts.

2684
02:01:31,208 --> 02:01:32,583
Slacks and get married.

2685
02:01:33,625 --> 02:01:35,166
It isn't slack, monkey.

2686
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:36,291
It is relax.

2687
02:01:36,375 --> 02:01:39,333
Whatever it is. You are getting married.

2688
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:42,000
Yes. I am.

2689
02:01:48,083 --> 02:01:51,708
Okay, so hang up now.
I have a lot of work. I will call later.

2690
02:01:51,791 --> 02:01:52,791
Madhu. I..

2691
02:01:55,375 --> 02:01:56,375
Oh no. Okay.

2692
02:01:56,708 --> 02:01:58,458
When you cannot think about me..

2693
02:01:59,125 --> 02:02:00,541
..even I wouldn't think of you.

2694
02:02:23,833 --> 02:02:25,375
Madhu. You got a call.

2695
02:02:26,458 --> 02:02:27,250
From where?

2696
02:02:27,375 --> 02:02:29,083
From Indo Canadian marriage bureau.

2697
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:30,583
They have seen a girl for you.

2698
02:02:30,833 --> 02:02:32,125
Foreigner girl. -Yes.

2699
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:38,083
What is it? Aren't you happy?

2700
02:02:38,875 --> 02:02:39,958
Why wouldn't I be happy?

2701
02:02:40,208 --> 02:02:42,128
I have come to Canada
to marry a foreigner woman.

2702
02:02:43,041 --> 02:02:45,333
Can't you see me and
understand how happy I am?

2703
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,780
Who are you trying to fool? Yes?

2704
02:02:47,333 --> 02:02:50,166
A wound. And a tummy that is
six months pregnant cannot be hidden.

2705
02:02:50,333 --> 02:02:51,573
It will show the pain for sure.

2706
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:53,375
When is Ria's wedding?

2707
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:55,375
Why would I know when her wedding is?

2708
02:02:55,666 --> 02:02:57,266
Am I going to do
catering at her wedding?

2709
02:02:58,541 --> 02:03:01,416
Hey, don't try to
cheat your heart, Madhu.

2710
02:03:01,916 --> 02:03:03,436
Do whatever your heart asks you to do.

2711
02:03:03,541 --> 02:03:04,708
Yes. - What should I do?

2712
02:03:04,833 --> 02:03:07,392
Should I have unshaven beard and
long hair and roam around on the roads?

2713
02:03:07,416 --> 02:03:08,708
Even she could have told me.

2714
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
But what did she say?

2715
02:03:10,083 --> 02:03:11,243
She hasn't given me a dollar.

2716
02:03:11,625 --> 02:03:13,505
She wanted to pay off
the debts before marriage.

2717
02:03:13,833 --> 02:03:15,041
Hey, fool.

2718
02:03:15,250 --> 02:03:19,041
Wanted to pay the debts? Meaning she
wanted to tell you about her feelings.

2719
02:03:19,125 --> 02:03:20,405
She could have told me directly.

2720
02:03:20,625 --> 02:03:24,166
Girls cannot express their
feeling directly, Madhu. - Yes.

2721
02:03:24,458 --> 02:03:25,458
Here you are.

2722
02:03:25,916 --> 02:03:27,125
Call her.

2723
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:30,041
Come on. - Call her.

2724
02:03:32,666 --> 02:03:33,666
Fool!

2725
02:03:39,708 --> 02:03:40,988
What is it? Did you get through?

2726
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:43,750
It says switched off.

2727
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:48,416
Son, I think you have to go
back to Kolkata to take one dollar back.

2728
02:03:49,458 --> 02:03:50,291
Madhu.

2729
02:03:50,375 --> 02:03:51,975
The wedding date of Ria is coming close.

2730
02:03:52,041 --> 02:03:54,083
Don't delay. Go.

2731
02:03:55,958 --> 02:03:56,958
Go.

2732
02:03:57,625 --> 02:03:58,666
Go!

2733
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:26,416
Let it be. Let it be.

2734
02:04:27,583 --> 02:04:28,875
I have scolded you a lot.

2735
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:34,250
Don't forget us. Okay? - Never.

2736
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:38,208
Go.

2737
02:04:44,541 --> 02:04:46,375
Hello. Kali Pada speaking.

2738
02:04:46,458 --> 02:04:47,791
Yes, Madhu here. Can you hear me?

2739
02:04:47,833 --> 02:04:48,833
Yes, tell me.

2740
02:04:49,083 --> 02:04:52,083
I am coming back to the country. Come
to the airport to pick me up tomorrow.

2741
02:04:52,333 --> 02:04:53,601
And we have to get
your sister-in-law as well.

2742
02:04:53,625 --> 02:04:54,625
What?

2743
02:05:02,708 --> 02:05:04,375
He is here. Play it. - He is here.

2744
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,083
Hey, what is this?
What are you doing? Hey.

2745
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,120
Hey, what is happening here?

2746
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:11,291
Yes? - Hey!

2747
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:12,791
Where is daughter-in-law?

2748
02:05:12,875 --> 02:05:13,875
I have come to get her.

2749
02:05:14,333 --> 02:05:16,166
Have you kept sister-in-law inside?

2750
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:17,875
Stop playing!

2751
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,351
Hey, I have been telling them that
I have come to get their sister-in-law.

2752
02:05:21,375 --> 02:05:22,975
What is the meaning of this foolishness?

2753
02:05:23,166 --> 02:05:25,083
Father. Go home.

2754
02:05:25,375 --> 02:05:27,351
Go and tell mother to
decorate the veneration plate.

2755
02:05:27,375 --> 02:05:28,735
I am getting your daughter-in-law.

2756
02:05:28,875 --> 02:05:31,708
Come on. Let us go. - Hey.. - Hey!

2757
02:05:33,458 --> 02:05:35,624
Don't ask me anymore.
The market is in such a bad condition.

2758
02:05:35,625 --> 02:05:36,208
Uncle.

2759
02:05:36,333 --> 02:05:37,853
Where is the Ballygunge circular road?

2760
02:05:37,958 --> 02:05:39,916
When you go ahead, there is a signal.

2761
02:05:40,083 --> 02:05:41,541
And then, take a left from there.

2762
02:05:41,625 --> 02:05:42,625
How long will it take?

2763
02:05:42,708 --> 02:05:43,708
Now around ten minutes.

2764
02:05:43,833 --> 02:05:44,833
Okay.

2765
02:05:55,041 --> 02:05:56,041
Thank you.

2766
02:05:56,125 --> 02:05:57,684
Yes. - Shall I leave?
- Take care, dear.

2767
02:05:57,708 --> 02:05:58,708
Yes.

2768
02:06:04,708 --> 02:06:06,000
I am leaving. - Yes.

2769
02:06:57,375 --> 02:06:58,375
What happened?

2770
02:06:59,208 --> 02:07:00,875
Why are you walking
around here like this?

2771
02:07:01,125 --> 02:07:02,333
I am very worried.

2772
02:07:02,583 --> 02:07:04,541
I am very worried about our son.

2773
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:07,666
Look, since the time he has come back,
he isn't eating.

2774
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:08,958
Nor talking to anyone.

2775
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:11,250
He is not saying anything.
He is sitting quietly.

2776
02:07:11,541 --> 02:07:13,958
I have never seen him
in such a sad state ever.

2777
02:07:15,083 --> 02:07:18,291
Go. Go and talk to him once.

2778
02:07:35,666 --> 02:07:37,541
If you have come to pacify me,
don't bother.

2779
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:40,875
I have no wish to speak about her.

2780
02:07:41,416 --> 02:07:43,541
When a son becomes of
the same height as his father..

2781
02:07:44,416 --> 02:07:45,541
..he becomes like a friend.

2782
02:07:46,458 --> 02:07:47,625
No.

2783
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:49,375
I have not come to pacify you.

2784
02:07:50,041 --> 02:07:51,708
Do whatever you wish to do.

2785
02:07:52,625 --> 02:07:54,833
Just don't sit in
a closed room like this.

2786
02:07:55,416 --> 02:07:56,833
Forget about me.

2787
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:58,833
But think about mother.

2788
02:07:59,708 --> 02:08:03,333
Come out of the house
and meet your friends and all.

2789
02:08:03,416 --> 02:08:04,833
Be happy.

2790
02:08:05,291 --> 02:08:07,958
Look. I had come to
tell you about this rest.

2791
02:08:09,708 --> 02:08:12,208
It is not rest, dad. It is request.

2792
02:08:12,541 --> 02:08:13,583
Whatever it is.

2793
02:08:14,833 --> 02:08:15,958
Do listen to me.

2794
02:08:26,583 --> 02:08:29,250
If fear is gone,
my name will go for a toss.

2795
02:08:36,916 --> 02:08:38,833
Close down Karachi.

2796
02:08:50,625 --> 02:08:51,708
What.. - Hey, sorry.

2797
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:56,958
Hey, Mr. Only Madhusudan Dutta.

2798
02:08:58,166 --> 02:08:59,750
In India? How is everything?

2799
02:08:59,833 --> 02:09:01,958
Fine. I have come to the country.

2800
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:02,708
How are you?

2801
02:09:02,958 --> 02:09:03,791
Fine.

2802
02:09:03,875 --> 02:09:06,500
And Ria? - Even she is fine.

2803
02:09:07,125 --> 02:09:08,500
She is only waiting for someone.

2804
02:09:09,083 --> 02:09:09,833
Meaning?

2805
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:11,226
I didn't understand anything.

2806
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:12,450
What kind of a friend are you?

2807
02:09:12,875 --> 02:09:15,500
You remained so close and yet,
you didn't understand this much?

2808
02:09:16,791 --> 02:09:21,375
Actually what happened was that I called
Ria three days before the marriage.

2809
02:09:21,916 --> 02:09:23,500
Ria. We are childhood friends.

2810
02:09:25,125 --> 02:09:28,416
We mustn't hide things from
each other...

2811
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:31,020
which will make us lose respect
for each other in the future.

2812
02:09:31,833 --> 02:09:32,958
We wouldn't hide, right?

2813
02:09:37,041 --> 02:09:38,125
No.

2814
02:09:39,666 --> 02:09:42,208
Even I wouldn't hide. - Meaning?

2815
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:46,416
Ria, our marriage was
fixed since a long time.

2816
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:50,500
And we are childhood friends.
And we will be life partners.

2817
02:09:50,833 --> 02:09:53,233
I had thought that we will
fall in love for sure. I did love.

2818
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:56,125
But I fell in love with Lisa.

2819
02:09:58,541 --> 02:09:59,541
Lisa?

2820
02:10:00,708 --> 02:10:02,208
Air hostess.

2821
02:10:02,291 --> 02:10:04,166
We have flown to
many countries together.

2822
02:10:04,916 --> 02:10:09,416
And then I understood that
we have fallen in love with each other.

2823
02:10:11,375 --> 02:10:12,291
Look, I know.

2824
02:10:12,375 --> 02:10:14,851
It is lowly to say these things
three days prior to the marriage.

2825
02:10:14,875 --> 02:10:16,083
But what should I do?

2826
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:18,958
Before telling you,
I thought about it a lot.

2827
02:10:19,041 --> 02:10:20,666
And tried to explain myself as well.

2828
02:10:22,791 --> 02:10:24,250
But I couldn't.

2829
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:28,291
Okay. You tell me.
Can love be controlled?

2830
02:10:29,125 --> 02:10:31,708
Anyone can fall in love
with anyone at any time.

2831
02:10:31,791 --> 02:10:32,833
Isn't it?

2832
02:10:36,083 --> 02:10:39,041
I don't know why but my heartbeat
becomes faster when I see her.

2833
02:10:39,791 --> 02:10:41,875
There is lightening in my body.

2834
02:10:41,958 --> 02:10:44,309
I mean there is a light of..
- Light of seven colors in a rainbow.

2835
02:10:44,333 --> 02:10:46,809
There are thousands and thousands
of stars in the sky at night.

2836
02:10:46,833 --> 02:10:48,101
And that light has fallen on you.

2837
02:10:48,125 --> 02:10:49,375
Yes, absolutely.

2838
02:10:49,916 --> 02:10:50,958
Hey, one minute.

2839
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:52,250
How did you..

2840
02:10:53,666 --> 02:10:55,375
Did you experience the same?

2841
02:10:56,708 --> 02:10:57,708
Who did you see? Me?

2842
02:10:58,041 --> 02:11:01,791
Why? Isn't there any other
boy except you in this world?

2843
02:11:02,083 --> 02:11:03,083
Meaning?

2844
02:11:03,166 --> 02:11:04,416
On seeing someone else?

2845
02:11:04,916 --> 02:11:06,666
Your marriage is
fixed and someone else..

2846
02:11:07,125 --> 02:11:09,166
Disgusting. Didn't you feel ashamed?

2847
02:11:10,541 --> 02:11:11,750
Didn't you feel ashamed?

2848
02:11:11,833 --> 02:11:13,958
Lowly. Characterless man.

2849
02:11:14,458 --> 02:11:16,618
If we have to judge that,
both of us are characterless.

2850
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:21,458
But seriously,
how should I explain to my family?

2851
02:11:21,791 --> 02:11:22,625
I cannot understand that.

2852
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:24,375
Leave all that on me.

2853
02:11:24,416 --> 02:11:27,583
Just be ready to marry Lisa
after three days. That is it.

2854
02:11:29,791 --> 02:11:30,500
Thank you.

2855
02:11:30,583 --> 02:11:32,916
Come on. Characterless man.

2856
02:11:38,416 --> 02:11:40,416
That means Ria didn't
get married to you?

2857
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:42,166
How can I?

2858
02:11:42,583 --> 02:11:44,143
Thank God Ria understood the situation.

2859
02:11:44,541 --> 02:11:47,000
And you did tell me not to marry her.

2860
02:11:47,916 --> 02:11:49,500
You are still standing here?

2861
02:11:49,583 --> 02:11:50,916
The show has started.

2862
02:11:51,083 --> 02:11:53,500
Let me introduce.
He is Madhu. Ria's friend.

2863
02:11:54,166 --> 02:11:55,666
And she is Lisa. My wife.

2864
02:11:56,291 --> 02:11:56,750
Hi.

2865
02:11:56,833 --> 02:11:58,633
Bye. I don't have time to wait.
- Hey, listen.

2866
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,208
Hey, do I look so bad?

2867
02:12:03,666 --> 02:12:05,040
He ran on seeing me.

2868
02:12:05,041 --> 02:12:06,681
I think he is the
one Ria is in love with.

2869
02:12:07,041 --> 02:12:09,125
And Ria is waiting for her. - I see.

2870
02:12:09,416 --> 02:12:10,458
Come on. - Come on.

2871
02:12:13,541 --> 02:12:15,750
Hey. Wait, wait.

2872
02:12:17,041 --> 02:12:18,041
Hey, hey, lift. Lift.

2873
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:21,416
Hey, hey, lift. Lift.

2874
02:12:22,458 --> 02:12:26,125
Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.
- Hey, what is this?

2875
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,165
Will you drop me at Ballygunge?

2876
02:12:29,166 --> 02:12:31,124
Hey, you?

2877
02:12:31,125 --> 02:12:32,000
My trip to foreign country
was cancelled because of you.

2878
02:12:32,001 --> 02:12:35,333
My life was ruined.
I will not take you at all.

2879
02:12:36,083 --> 02:12:37,476
I will give you 500. - How much? 500?

2880
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:38,125
What will I do with 500?

2881
02:12:38,208 --> 02:12:39,333
No, no, Madna. 1000.

2882
02:12:39,416 --> 02:12:40,642
It will take 1000.
1000. - Yes, that is fine.

2883
02:12:40,666 --> 02:12:41,958
How will 1000 suffice? - What?

2884
02:12:43,333 --> 02:12:45,309
I can take you if you pay me 1500.
- Yes, yes, okay, okay.

2885
02:12:45,333 --> 02:12:46,125
I will give it. Yes. - Yes, okay.

2886
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:47,958
Hey, hey, hey, how can you sit here?

2887
02:12:50,166 --> 02:12:51,416
There is no place.

2888
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:56,250
Come on, come on. Quickly.

2889
02:12:56,708 --> 02:13:00,625
Hey, Madna.
Don't leave him. Take 1500 for sure.

2890
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,083
Come on. Come on. - Yes.

2891
02:13:02,166 --> 02:13:03,666
Come on. Ride faster. - Yes, yes.

2892
02:13:04,958 --> 02:13:06,791
Ride faster. My lover is waiting for me.

2893
02:13:06,875 --> 02:13:08,555
Ride faster.
- Yes, I am going. I am going.

2894
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:16,375
Brother. Come on, ride faster.
It is quite urgent.

2895
02:13:21,208 --> 02:13:22,583
Hey, ride faster

2896
02:13:23,333 --> 02:13:24,434
That is it.
That is it. Stop here. Stop here.

2897
02:13:24,458 --> 02:13:25,958
Yes, yes. Stop here. Stop here.

2898
02:13:28,208 --> 02:13:29,351
Here you are. Keep the rest, okay?

2899
02:13:29,375 --> 02:13:30,375
Hey, brother.

2900
02:13:30,666 --> 02:13:31,666
Listen.

2901
02:13:32,875 --> 02:13:35,708
I have earned a lot of money in life.
But you really love her, right?

2902
02:13:35,791 --> 02:13:37,166
Go. I will not take money today.

2903
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:38,625
This is your gift.

2904
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,625
I am not married. But we are
with people who are really in love.

2905
02:13:42,958 --> 02:13:44,458
Go. Go to your Juliet.

2906
02:13:44,541 --> 02:13:45,875
Thank you. - I am leaving.

2907
02:13:53,166 --> 02:13:54,166
Aunt. - Yes?

2908
02:13:54,333 --> 02:13:56,750
Where is Ria?
- She is upstairs. Who are you?

2909
02:13:57,041 --> 02:13:58,041
Your son-in-law.

2910
02:13:59,000 --> 02:13:59,583
Son-in-law?

2911
02:13:59,666 --> 02:14:00,708
Son-in-law?

2912
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:03,250
Ria.

2913
02:14:05,875 --> 02:14:06,875
Ria.

2914
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:11,291
Ria.

2915
02:14:12,333 --> 02:14:13,333
Ria.

2916
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:14,791
Ria.

2917
02:14:15,625 --> 02:14:17,125
Madhu? - Ria. Where are you?

2918
02:14:18,041 --> 02:14:18,625
Ria.

2919
02:14:18,708 --> 02:14:19,708
Madhu?

2920
02:14:20,458 --> 02:14:21,458
Ria.

2921
02:14:21,958 --> 02:14:22,958
Madhu.

2922
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:25,250
Ria. - Madhu.

2923
02:14:25,250 --> 02:14:26,250
Come here.

2924
02:14:26,333 --> 02:14:28,541
Yes, yes, I am coming. I am coming.

2925
02:14:35,833 --> 02:14:36,833
Ria.

2926
02:14:37,708 --> 02:14:38,958
How did you go that side?

2927
02:14:39,041 --> 02:14:41,267
Hey, you have so many windows. I cannot
understand which one is the right door.

2928
02:14:41,291 --> 02:14:42,375
Wait, I am coming.

2929
02:14:43,416 --> 02:14:44,434
Hey, hey, you will fall down.

2930
02:14:44,458 --> 02:14:45,500
Come from that side.

2931
02:14:45,541 --> 02:14:46,541
Oh yes.

2932
02:14:49,375 --> 02:14:50,666
"Bengali Babu."

2933
02:15:00,250 --> 02:15:01,875
Ria. Where did you go now?

2934
02:15:02,375 --> 02:15:03,375
Madhu?

2935
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:05,208
Where did you go?

2936
02:15:05,291 --> 02:15:06,625
Hey, if this a house or a puzzle?

2937
02:15:06,875 --> 02:15:07,955
I have reached the terrace.

2938
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,791
Oh my God.

2939
02:15:11,958 --> 02:15:13,267
Should one have so
many stairs in the house?

2940
02:15:13,291 --> 02:15:14,726
Oh no.. - I don't know
where each one leads.

2941
02:15:14,750 --> 02:15:15,750
Wait, I am coming.

2942
02:15:16,125 --> 02:15:17,250
Wait there. I am coming.

2943
02:15:17,666 --> 02:15:18,666
Oh no. - Yes.

2944
02:15:53,625 --> 02:15:54,166
What was that for?

2945
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:57,541
This is for fighting with me over
the phone and making me cry all night.

2946
02:15:57,625 --> 02:15:58,875
Do you know how sad I was?

2947
02:15:59,166 --> 02:16:01,375
Were you sad alone? Didn't it affect me?

2948
02:16:01,708 --> 02:16:03,041
Do you know how sad I was?

2949
02:16:03,125 --> 02:16:04,767
Then why did you say all
that to me on the phone that day?

2950
02:16:04,791 --> 02:16:06,392
You could have told
me about your feeling.

2951
02:16:06,416 --> 02:16:07,416
Monkey.

2952
02:16:11,791 --> 02:16:14,000
I am a monkey.
And have run around foreigner women.

2953
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:16,086
I didn't understand that
I fell in love with you.

2954
02:16:16,166 --> 02:16:17,375
But you are educated.

2955
02:16:17,458 --> 02:16:20,375
You understood. So why did you
not tell me that you aren't married?
