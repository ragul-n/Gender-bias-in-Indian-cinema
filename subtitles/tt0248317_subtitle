1
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,320
Move those things.

2
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,800
-Stylish house, Aunt.
-Come.

3
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,800
-May i use this room?
-Alone?
-So what?
-Ok. As you like.

4
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Why is this room locked?

5
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,800
Can't find the key of it.
Some old things are in this room.
So who needs to open it?!

6
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,800
Father, Aunt is saying that
i won't go back to hostel again.

7
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,800
You just sit here.

8
00:03:47,320 --> 00:04:08,800
We're in a difficult situation after buying this house.
Your brother returned after cancelling the visa.
In between, this bus accident too..the compensation for the dead and injured is also a headache.
So it's difficult to educate both of you together.

9
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,800
Rameshan has good practise now.
His mother urge for the marriage quickly.

10
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,800
Why should i stop my study
because Rameshan has good practise?

11
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Why do you want to study more?
Even if you attain a degree,
you're supposed to live as the wife of him.

12
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm not ready to live like such a wife.

13
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,800
This is her trick for the quick marriage.

14
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,800
-Have his both ears gone?
-Be careful.

15
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,800
-Have you eaten?
-Very much.

16
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,800
-Where is Rashmi?
-On upstairs. After a tiff with us.

17
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,800
Why in darkness?

18
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,800
Don't you want to see it?

19
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,800
-May i ask you a thing?
-A thing?.. Fire.

20
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,800
-I like to marry only after completing
my studies.
-Agreed.

21
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm not joking. I want to study.
After degree, i need to
go for diploma in journalism.

22
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Is that enough? Agreed.
Marriage will only be at the time you wish.

23
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,800
-Sure?
-Sure. At least now, please smile.

24
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Nuisance.

25
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,800
Didn't even allow us to romance in peace.

26
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,800
Hello.

27
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,800
Did anything happen to you when the car hit?

28
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,800
Hey, nothing happened.

29
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,800
-Lost all things, is it?
-What things? I didn't have anything.

30
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,800
I was in that car. I felt sad by thinking
that something had happened to you.

31
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,800
Nothing happened dear.

32
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
See you later.

33
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,800
Why are you sitting here?

34
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,800
For selling some baskets to this shop.
They will give something. For that,
i'm waiting.

35
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,800
Why are you fatigued?

36
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,800
Tired..very much tired.

37
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,800
Haven't they given the money?

38
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,800
Will give after a long time.

39
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,800
-What is the price of this basket?
-25 rupees.
-Twenty five? Then how much you give
to the person who made this?

40
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,800
If i must give him the entire money,
then why should i do this business?

41
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,800
Give him what he deserves soon.
Why you make this poor man sit
in this hot place for long?

42
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,800
So you don't have time nowadays, is it?

43
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
You come.

44
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,800
-Why aren't you eating?
-I don't feel hungry.
-I feel extremely hungry.

45
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,800
You eat.

46
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,800
What are you thinking?

47
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,800
Everyone call me Mada (Buffalo).

48
00:11:29,320 --> 00:12:15,800
I've been here for so many years.
Before that i was working
for a christian family.
The matriarch of that family
need the poop of otter for a medicine
to stop the drinking of her husband.
I came here to search the poop.

49
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,800
That's when i firstly saw Shima Thampuran,
the lord of this region.

50
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,800
Who are you?

51
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
I'm from east.

52
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,800
Why are you here?

53
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
I..otter's..

54
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,800
Who are you to otter?

55
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Poop

56
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,800
Otter's poop?
What you want actually?

57
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Otter's poop.

58
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
For what?

59
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
To stop drinking.

60
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Do you drink?

61
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,320
It's not for me. It's for my master.

62
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,800
Ok..say about it.

63
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,800
After we paste the otter's poop
in a glass and give toddy in it,
he can't drink ever again.

64
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,800
We can import this medicine to England.

65
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,800
If you don't need to find this poop
and go back, you can stay here.

66
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,800
There will be work in paddy field.
And some other small works too.
What do you say?

67
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,800
I liked the streams, water lilies,
lake water..in here.

68
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,800
And above all that,
i like Shima Thampuran.

69
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
Mada, do you like our place?

70
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,800
Learned the work?

71
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,800
You come.

72
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,800
How is your stay?

73
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,800
Fine.

74
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
You have to go to the market
tomorrow morning.

75
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:57,800
[Talking about astrology]

76
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:08,800
[Objection of it]

77
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:23,800
We were searching for you Mada.
At least we are from the same place.
May because of the fate you're struggling..
Do you have any job?

78
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Yes, i have.

79
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,800
What is the use in getting a job in some
other place! Do you get anything to eat?

80
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,800
What a pity! Here you mayn't have
at least a place to sleep.

81
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,800
It's not like that sir.
Here i have a job, have food
and also have a place to stay.

82
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:48,800
Mada, i came here because of not
having any job in our place.
This Panchangam not work out nowadays.
It has been two days,
i haven't eaten and slept.

83
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,800
What is the benefit in having everything
in some other place!
Hometown is always the best.

84
00:19:51,320 --> 00:20:03,800
Human life is not supposed to
live like a servant. According
to our hindu culture..
oh, you don't understand such things.

85
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm Gopala Kaimal. From Mada's hometown.

86
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,800
Kaimal is telling me to return.

87
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,800
What have you replied?

88
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
I said that, i won't
go to anywhere from here.

89
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Why don't you shave this beard?

90
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Tell that Karuvan Irayachan that,
i told him to make a knife for shaving.

91
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,800
Shaving the face is a status.

92
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,800
Have you shave by yourself?

93
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,800
I'll teach. You have to do it carefully.
Else cuts will occur on face.

94
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,800
First, you sit on the side
of a stream, that clearly
display your face.

95
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,800
Then take the knife and hold
it on the side of face.

96
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,800
Now shave. Else, for what you're waiting?

97
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,800
Why are you so much happy Mada?

98
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,800
There is a great feast by Thampuran
for the inauguration of new wheel
made by Nambunni Asari.

99
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
That's why you're over-excited like this?

100
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,800
Have it.

101
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Start.

102
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,800
-What police has done to you?
-The same thing everyone is doing on me.
-Then why they cut your hair?
-Because they love me more.

103
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,800
Why don't you marry?

104
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm already married.
I have a daughter too.

105
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,800
At England?

106
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,800
Then, why don't you go to England?

107
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:37,800
No, Mada. I can't go there again.
They expelled me from there.

108
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,800
Expelling Thampuran?

109
00:30:50,320 --> 00:31:02,800
You can't understand it.
I was expelled to British India from England
for supporting the Irish Republican Army.

110
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,800
Was the marriage function fine?

111
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,800
-Gopi, where are you going to wander?
-To feel the breeze. Are you coming?
-Get lost.

112
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,800
-The matching nephew of Uncle.
-It can be vice versa.

113
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,800
Why are you cursing him?

114
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,800
Oh, there is another one here too.
Where may be he is?
May went to find candles
with that lower caste guy.

115
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,800
He's looking after all the things here well.
If he light the candles as per his own wish,
what's your problem in it?

116
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,800
You mayn't have any problem.
But if he had married on time and have
a boy, then i wouldn't have to find
boys from outside for my girls.

117
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,800
Yuck! I don't want uncle's son.

118
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,800
Mada, come and bath with me.

119
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,800
Oh, no lord. I'll bath later.

120
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,800
Come.

121
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Gone?

122
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,800
At evening, after bathing,
Thampuran pray (hindu) with his mother.

123
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,800
At night, he pray alone
by lighting candles.

124
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,800
Both the prayers are equal for him.

125
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:02,800
On feast, Thampuran light candles
all over the room, and dance with
an unseen person.

126
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,800
His craziness has increased.

127
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,800
Why are you always on upstairs?

128
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:47,800
That locked room is that of Shima Thampuran.
He was a great man.

129
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,800
Don't tell these Shima Thampuran things
to your father.
We're blaming ourselves now for buying
this damn house.

130
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,800
Get up and go away idiot.

131
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:12,800
Shima Thampuran was in Irish Republican Army.
So he was expelled from England.
He always thought about
his wife and daughter there..

132
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,800
Even we didn't hear about such things.
How you, a new person to here know
all these things?

133
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,800
I met a person named Mada here.
Mada, Ponthan Mada.

134
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,800
What are you singing?

135
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,800
I'm not singing dear,
i'm hearing.

136
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:42,800
In old days, we ourselves do
all the works here manually.
Nowadays everything is done by machines.
Then,..masters are discussing.

137
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,800
I can't invest in agriculture
by suffering loss, as you told.

138
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,800
-What you get in driving autorickshaw?
-That depends!
-Anyhow?
-Atleast 50 rupees.

139
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,800
But giving that 50 rupees to labours. Is it?
Then why don't you leave your autorickhaw
and do the work by yourself?
Thereafter, will there be any loss?

140
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,800
We are not interested in doing
this agriculture job lifelong.

141
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:58,800
When they became farmers?
Almost three quarters of this land was ours.
Later government gave it to them.
Now, if they think doing agriculture is
not profitable, they should give
back those lands to us. Instead of it,
they don't have the right to stop work
here. Scoundrels.

142
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,800
Please talk quietly.

143
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,800
-Sir, what is the decision?
-Mada, this time there will be
no work in land.

144
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:18,800
-Why Mada want to know all these things?
I'll give you a penny, you go and eat
some piece of tapioca.
-But sir, our land..

145
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:37,800
Our land? Do you have a piece of land?
Land of people like me was taken away
and gave it to some useless.
But did the government give anything
to the real labours who worked in field?
Why didn't the government give any land
to this aquatic Ponthan Mada, who crawled
his entire life in water and duckweeds?

146
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,800
-If you enter in politics, you will shine.
-Huh..politics!

147
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:58,800
Look at the fate. He's the only
nephew of Shima Thampuran.
Donated everything that got from partition.
And now blaming others.

148
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,800
Anyway you learned it.

149
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,800
What are you saying?

150
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Take it.

151
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,800
Bye. You sit alone.

152
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:33,800
-I'm going. It might rain today.
Only mother knows i'm here. She'll wait.
Gopi is also not at home.
-Where is Gopi Thampuran?
-Who knows! His matters are like that.

153
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,800
Take us to Kallumma.

154
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,800
Don't tell about this to anyone.

155
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:40,800
Water is overflowing. So it's urgent
to go to the field now. But at this time,
no workers are ready for it.
Heard that Karthu is here.
Can you send her?

156
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:46,800
-Should give more wage.
-Agreed. I'm going. Hope Karthu
will come there soon.

157
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,800
When Karthu has come?

158
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,800
Not has come by herself,
he dumped her here.

159
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,800
No sound from there.
Shall i look where they are?

160
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:45,800
They are lying on the ground
and hugging each other.
Look at them.

161
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:01,800
What is there to look?
Men are like that.
What is the use in having
only a giant body
for a stupid (Ponthan) like you?

162
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,800
What they are trying to prove?

163
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,800
Don't you want to go home?

164
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,800
Mada, tell about this to Thampuran.
Then start living with her.

165
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,800
The Ezhavans will beat and kill you,
like killing a rabid dog.

166
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,800
When that man dumped me for no reason,
no Ezhavan was here for questioning it.

167
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,800
Mada, look at the courage of this woman.

168
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,320
Ponthan Mada also needs a woman.
Isn't it mother?

169
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:48,800
Take what you need.
And go and make a hut
in Kizhakke Parambu.

170
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:42,800
Mada, you Mulaya, son of a bitch,
how dare you to marry an Ezhava woman?

171
01:01:50,320 --> 01:02:00,800
Do you think that there are
no manful Ezhavans here to question it?
Come out if you have guts.
We will burn your hut.
Instead of hiding behind the woman,
come and face us you sissy.

172
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:28,800
Since this is Thampuran's property
you can escape now.
But you'll come out. We know how
to handle you then.

173
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,800
How's it?

174
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,800
At night, people come and threatening us.

175
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,800
Don't worry. Nobody will harm you
till i am here.

176
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:57,800
Excellent item.
But bit difficult to handle.

177
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:23,800
-Both of you have come to see the market?
-What's the price of this?
-No need to pay for it.
Give that to her.

178
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,800
Are you a man?
Giggling at whatever others say..

179
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,800
Are you angry?

180
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:30,800
Is this Mada's house?
Heard everything..
I'm from his hometown.
Where is he?

181
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:37,800
-Went to see Thampuran.
-Oh, Thampuran..i know.
May i have to wait..?
ok i'll wait.

182
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:53,800
I know what his caste is.
But i like him. That's why i come here.

183
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,800
Has come to see your family.
Your wife is beautiful.

184
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:34,800
If anybody in my hometown knows
about i eating food from a house
like this, that'll create an earthquake.
I also look all these. But except
in the case of him. Because i like him.
Please take some more rice.

185
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,800
Is there anything to drink?

186
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,800
Mada, something has
crawled over my body.
May be a rat.

187
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,320
It may be dream.

188
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,320
It's a rat, i think.
Light the lamp.

189
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,800
It's not a rat,
it's a greater bandicoot rat.

190
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,800
Who has come here?

191
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:50,800
-That man.
-For what?
-Told me to come there.
-What you replied?

192
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,800
I replied nothing.

193
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:22,800
What?
Don't play your jokes here?
Go away.

194
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:12,800
Mada, you should help me.
My wife is ill.
Send your Karthu for ten days
to my house for helping her.
What's the problem for you in it?
You always do the things by yourself.

195
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:28,800
[Talking business]

196
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,800
Bring her to the backside.

197
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,800
It's difficult to get a worker

198
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,800
Come here.

199
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:46,800
What are you doing in water like buffaloes?
Where is Thampuran?
There is a letter for him,
from England.

200
01:14:52,320 --> 01:15:00,800
-I shall give it to him.
-No need for that. I'll give it
by myself. This is from England.
Hope Thampuran is at the temple.

201
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:12,800
-What is the matter sir?
-Nothing.
-There will be something..since the
letter is from England.
-I told you it's nothing. Get lost.

202
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:43,800
My Catherine has gone.
She passed away from this world
by leaving me and my daughter alone.

203
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,800
Will my Karthu come back, Thampuran?

204
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,800
She'll not come back ever again.

205
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,800
Is there any use in my waiting for her?

206
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,800
There is no point in waiting.

207
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:58,800
In this place, even in the mid
of these many people, i feel lonely.

208
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,800
Talking with you is the only relief.

209
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,800
Why you're like the one who chew ginger?

210
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:28,800
When someone ask,
sending wife with them..
Then walking with sadness.

211
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:43,800
She is staying there only for few days.
After that, she'll come back.
Else, you go and call her.
She's your woman. Isn't it?

212
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,800
You..dumb and silly.

213
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:06,800
What's up Mada?
Your Karthu is very fine there.
You can't even recognize her now.

214
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,800
She has become little fat.

215
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:42,800
-Mada, don't you feel ashamed to send
her with that rascal?
-For working..
-What work? Do you know
what type of work that is?
If you have guts, go and bring her back.

216
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:18,800
This chicken became too old.
Pluck a papaya fruit from there.

217
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,800
I..have come to call you.

218
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,800
Is there any bond to come
with you when you call?!

219
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:25,800
-Father is calling you.
-Tell him that i'm preparing this chicken.
-I already told it. You go and see him.
Else i'm the one who get shout from him.

220
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,800
Thampuran..

221
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,800
Come down.

222
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,800
Haven't you seen her again?

223
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:17,800
Yes. One more time..
one more time.

224
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,800
I am converted to Christianity
and changed the name to Katrina.

225
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,800
Going to Nelliyampathy hill for work.
You should come with me.

226
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:20,800
There, nobody will look caste.
We will have the freedom
to do anything without fear.
It's my wish..don't ignore.

227
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:07,800
I don't know why i did that.
Whether was it because of her conversion
or by hearing about hill?..i don't know.

228
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,800
Why are you crying dear?

229
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,800
Don't know.

230
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,800
Why you feel to tell
all these things to me?

231
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:55,800
Telling these is a relief,
if somebody is willing to hear.

232
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:00,800
Before you came,
i speak to this land.

233
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:12,800
People are saying that, i don't have
even a single piece of land.
I mayn't have land according
to the registrar office.

234
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:18,800
But these lands and fields are mine.
My sweat has fallen on all of these.

235
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:26,800
Now, nobody look after
this soil and land.
Like me, this too is uncared by people.

236
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:38,800
I hear the crying of it.
I come here at evening to hear that.

237
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:47,800
You are not like others.
You consider me as a human being.

238
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:57,800
People said that i have no one.
But i have. I had my Thampuran,
then Karthu..

239
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,800
Karthu went somewhere,
and Thampuran died.

240
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:17,800
When i see you, i think
about Thampuran.
Thampuran has a daughter,
somewhere in England.
I imagine you as that daughter.

241
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,800
How Thampuran died?

242
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:08,800
Mada, seed is not enough this time.
I told that Pallikkara Konappan
to arrange a 100 bushel seed for us.

243
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,800
Where are you going?

244
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,800
Shall i pack up your things
for the journey?

245
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:36,800
No.
I am not taking anything.

246
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:50,800
No one is responsible for my death.
After burning my body,
keep the ashes in a pot.
My daughter will come one day
and collect it.

247
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,800
Gopi, these things are not allowed
in our custom.

248
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,800
If uncle's wish was that,
it has to happen.

249
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:08,800
-Who you are to decide all these?
There are other men here.
-The thing men need was already written
by uncle..Bequeath. Is that enough?
-Don't treat us like some strangers.

250
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,800
All the things as per the
wish of my son should happen.

251
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,800
Padma, here she is.

252
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,800
Why is she not getting fat?

253
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,320
Stop. To where you're running?

254
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:52,800
Brother is saying that you want
to marry only after completing studies.
You don't have to earn by doing any job.
He's a well practised doctor.
So why do you need a job?
If you feel bored, just look after the cows
and the servants there.
That itself is a big time pass.

255
01:34:55,320 --> 01:35:04,800
I'm not joking.
I promised to your mother
on her deathbed.
That's why i come here regularly
and make my brother remember it.
Else, it doesn't mean that Rameshan
doesn't get any other girls to marry.

256
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:23,800
-Aunt, what is this?
Have all of you decided my marriage?
-Better agree what we say.

257
01:35:54,320 --> 01:36:03,800
-I need to talk with Rameshan.
-Is that necessary?
-Brother, please take him somewhere.
-Ok..cool down. We're going.
-Look at her show off..

258
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:16,320
-I was waiting for you. Where were you?
-I need to ask you something.
-Tell me.

259
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:28,800
-I already told you that i need to study.
-I agreed that. Then what's the problem?
-I need to complete degree,
then want to go to journalism.
-Everything will happen after our marriage.

260
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,800
Then,.. you'll ask me to look after
the cows and servants there.

261
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:38,800
Look Rashmi, mother is ill.
She talk the facts. She wish for
the quick marriage of us.

262
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:44,320
If you're adamant about it,
you only keep studying,
but i'll search some other girl.

263
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,800
At last, i've got you.

264
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,800
Stop your games dear.

265
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:16,800
Rashmi, stop your naughtiness.
I am your husband now. Don't forget it.

266
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,800
Rashmi, are you ok?

267
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:30,320
Dear..

268
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,800
How is she?

269
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:38,800
She was at the dispensary of her husband.
Later shifted to house.
Became less violent.
But now she is completely silent.

270
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:51,800
Misfortunes are following us,
since we buy this house.
You know about the bus accident?
Apart from all these,
he cancelled the visa and came back.

271
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,800
An unnatural death was occurred here,.
Shima Thampuran.

272
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:06,800
His remains like his bones
are in that locked room.
So it is necessary to open the door.

273
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:12,800
And someone who was very close
to him should float that bones.

274
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:20,800
-There is a nephew of him..
-He is mad. But another person who was
very close to Thampuran is alive,
Ponthan Mada.

275
01:41:44,320 --> 01:42:00,800
What to say, Mada?
Totally collapsed. When we bought
this house, nobody brought
the key of that locked room.
We thought that some useless old stuffs
are there in the room, and didn't pay
much attention to it.

276
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:22,800
I told you to come for a reason.
There is some bone or ash
of your Thampuran in that room.
You should float those things
in Bharathappuzha. I've arranged car
for you to go there.

277
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:29,800
You can enter the house
without any fear.
We're not looking such things.
Everything is collapsed.

278
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:36,800
-Where is that?
-Are you gone crazy father?
Copper pot, ghost of Thampuran..
some rubbish superstitions.

279
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:16,800
-Padma
-I'm going brother. Let her stay here.
-Padma..
-I will not allow this type of girl
to ruin my son's life.

280
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:39,800
Am i the daughter of Thampuran?
I have come. Where is his ashes?

281
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,800
'The Stupid Buffalo'
