00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:46,958
<i>"Butterfly...</i>

2
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,833
On the creepers, the flowers,

3
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,041
It laughs gently, the butterfly.

4
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,708
Tiny, colourful wings,
It sways and swings, the butterfly.

5
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:59,375
Her small eyes, shimmer and shine,
Like rounded gems, the butterfly.

6
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,000
I try to catch her, alas,
She flutters away, the butterfly."

7
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,125
Alright.

8
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,375
Jagruti, fill in the blanks.

9
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,458
Dash is the largest state in India...

10
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,791
Rajasthan.

11
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,500
Dash is the largest continent
in the world...

12
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,666
Asia.

13
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,375
Dash is the longest river in India...

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Narmada.

15
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,083
Wrong, Brahmaputra.

16
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,708
Sorry, Brahmaputra.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,916
Dash is the oldest mountain range
in India...

18
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,208
Don't forget to do your homework!

19
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,083
Yes… I’m coming. Reaching in five minutes.

20
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:06,041
WADGAON MASSACRE
CULTURAL PROTEST MEET

21
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,625
Thank you Miratai...

22
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:57,750
And now coming to perform for us
is people's poet, Narayan Kamble.

23
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,541
<i>Listen brother!</i>

24
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,500
<i>Oh brother...</i>

25
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,250
<i>My dear brother!</i>

26
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,666
<i>Pandemonium is here</i>
<i>Time to rise and revolt</i>

27
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,041
<i>Time to know your enemy</i>

28
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,708
<i>Time to know your enemy</i>

29
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,291
<i>Tough times are here</i>
<i>We’re uprooted from our soil</i>

30
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,958
<i>This era of blindness</i>
<i>Has gouged our eyes</i>

31
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,291
<i>A gent appears a crook</i>
<i>An owl resembles a peacock</i>

32
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:55,083
<i>A giant becomes babyish</i>
<i>A baby turns into a giant</i>

33
00:05:56,541 --> 00:06:00,875
<i>The good ones are forgotten</i>
<i>The good for nothings, praised</i>

34
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,041
<i>The enemy...</i>

35
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>The enemy is all-destructive</i>
<i>Yet we sing his praise</i>

36
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,416
<i>Time to know your enemy</i>

37
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,250
<i>Time to know your enemy</i>

38
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,833
<i>Satan is black and white</i>
<i>Your life trapped in his vice</i>

39
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,250
<i>Colour is his weapon of choice</i>
<i>As death raises its voice</i>

40
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,750
<i>Colours play a game of dice</i>
<i>The rules are divisive</i>

41
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:33,375
<i>Humanity is in its cage</i>
<i>It burns, it disintegrates</i>

42
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,541
<i>Colours that multicolour</i>
<i>Colours that discolour</i>

43
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:44,000
<i>The colour, it breaks</i>
<i>Now it looks fake</i>

44
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,583
<i>You are stupefied</i>
<i>How much will you forsake</i>

45
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:53,083
<i>These dense jungles</i>
<i>These rusty jungles</i>

46
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,625
<i>Religious jungles</i>
<i>Casteist jungles</i>

47
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,416
<i>Racist jungles</i>
<i>Nationalist jungles</i>

48
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:06,083
<i>On this deathly night</i>
<i>We lose all our senses</i>

49
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,625
<i>Hands bruised and burnt...</i>

50
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,833
<i>Hands bruised and burnt</i>
<i>Get a gift of boiling wax</i>

51
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,375
<i>Time to know your enemy</i>

52
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,875
<i>Time to know your enemy</i>

53
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,500
<i>The delusion of illusion</i>
<i>Money, it reigns supreme</i>

54
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,125
<i>Has turned man into a mongrel</i>
<i>This mongrel has 17 breeds</i>

55
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,875
<i>The blood is infested with hunger</i>
<i>Will this hunger be content, ever?</i>

56
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,666
<i>The search for happiness is on</i>
<i>But all directions are blurred</i>

57
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,041
<i>This razzle dazzle</i>
<i>Yes brother</i>

58
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,958
<i>This razzmatazz</i>
<i>Yes brother</i>

59
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,666
<i>This scam sham</i>
<i>Yes brother</i>

60
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,416
<i>These fancy malls</i>
<i>Yes brother</i> <i>Free for all</i>
<i>Yes brother</i>

61
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,041
<i>This great fall</i>
<i>Yes brother</i>

62
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,833
<i>Scam sham, huge malls</i>
<i>Great Fall, Great Fall</i>

63
00:07:55,958 --> 00:08:00,125
<i>Malady and gluttony</i>
<i>Gluttony and malady</i>

64
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:05,208
What's going on, stop this!

65
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,291
Where do I find Pradeep Shelke?

66
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,916
There, in that room.

67
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,458
Pradeep Shelke?

68
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,083
One minute please.

69
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,041
Can you fill the rest of the form outside?

70
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay sir. But please look into it.

71
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,500
I will.

72
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,000
-Hello sir.
-Hello.

73
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,375
Have a seat.

74
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,125
Tell me.

75
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,875
I wanted to speak to you
about Narayan Kamble’s arrest.

76
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,416
Are you his relative?

77
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,833
No. His lawyer.

78
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,666
-What is your name?
-Vinay Vora.

79
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,500
Can we meet him?

80
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,916
No, we’ve sent him to Jogeshwari.

81
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,000
We don’t have a holding cell here.

82
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,583
You are the investigating officer, right?

83
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,041
Yes.

84
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,208
On what charges was he arrested?

85
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,291
Didn’t you tell him?

86
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,291
He was right there.

87
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,958
What did you tell us?
You didn’t tell us anything.

88
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:16,083
No, I told him.
I had gone with the warrant.

89
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,708
-Can I see the warrant?
-Sure.

90
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,875
One minute.

91
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,041
Here.

92
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,875
Abetment of suicide?

93
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,958
Who committed suicide?

94
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,791
A man from the Sitladevi slums.

95
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,208
Who?

96
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,708
A manhole worker called Vasudev.

97
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh?

98
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,250
Just last week,

99
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,833
Narayan Kamble and his boys

100
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,500
had performed in that very slum.

101
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,541
-Am I right?
-Yes.

102
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,250
In one of his songs,

103
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:24,541
Kamble incited all manhole workers
to commit suicide.

104
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,458
No, he didn’t say anything of that sort.

105
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,458
That's what you are saying.

106
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,083
But we’ve received complaints,
we’ve got orders for his arrest.

107
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,333
Okay. Then?

108
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:40,250
Then what, two days later,
that man went down the gutter and died.

109
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,416
But it could be an accident...

110
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,458
No, it’s a clear case of suicide.

111
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,833
We don’t make arrests without proof.

112
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,666
What proof? Show it to us.

113
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,416
There’s no point arguing here.
We’ll talk about this later.

114
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,541
Exactly. Tomorrow you can ask the judge.

115
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,625
Okay sir. Here.

116
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:01,833
Okay.

117
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,875
-How about some tea?
-No sir.

118
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,291
Okay.

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,125
Thank you.

120
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,500
Everyone clear the way.

121
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,708
Move along.

122
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,791
Hello. Good morning ma'am.

123
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,666
What do you need?
Notary, stamp duty, affidavit?

124
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,791
I'll do it all.

125
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,041
Your next date is 5th September.

126
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,875
Sir, I have to go to my hometown
in September.

127
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,291
In that case, take a date in October.

128
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,000
-On 13th October, okay?
-Okay.

129
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,500
Thank you sir.

130
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,583
Case number 133,
Radhanagar Police Station, Bankim Shah.

131
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,666
Note...

132
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,083
Stolen watch reported.

133
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,208
The complainant claims that the watch
has been stolen by his neighbour.

134
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,125
Proceed.

135
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,000
Sir, I want to cross-examine him.

136
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,166
Okay.

137
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,750
-State your name.
-Bankim Shah.

138
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,750
When did you realise
that your watch has been stolen?

139
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,833
Our family had gone out of town...

140
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,125
When we came back, we realised
someone had cut the window grill.

141
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,458
Why didn’t you inform the police
about that?

142
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,125
I did, ask him.

143
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,041
-Had he mentioned it?
-Yes, he had.

144
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,583
Note down...

145
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:35,708
He had gone out for a week
and when he came back,

146
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,708
he saw the grill was cut,
and the watch was stolen.

147
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,125
Forget the "he informed the police" bit,
that’s not necessary.

148
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,625
Proceed.

149
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,833
Why do you think
Rakesh Shukla stole your watch?

150
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,541
Two weeks after the robbery,

151
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,666
someone in the neighbourhood
saw him wearing the same watch.

152
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,416
But can’t he own a similar watch?

153
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,416
How do you know it’s your watch?

154
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:06,166
The watch is not from here.
A relative had gifted it to me.

155
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,291
He got it from America.

156
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,500
Note...

157
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,916
Someone from their neighbourhood saw
Rakesh Shukla wearing the same watch,

158
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,166
and the watch was a gift from America.

159
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,208
Proceed.

160
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,125
But my client can also buy
a watch from America, right?

161
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,375
Please read the report carefully.

162
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,500
He has submitted the bill,
the serial number of the watch.

163
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,250
Yes, but can’t he also buy a watch?

164
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,500
Yes, but how can he buy a watch
with the same serial number?

165
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,458
It says here
that the serial number is matching

166
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,416
with that of the recovered watch.

167
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,625
How does it matter, the serial number
can be of the product itself.

168
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:50,833
What are you saying,
how can the serial number match?

169
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,875
How can there be just one serial number?

170
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,916
We need to look into that, sir.

171
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,166
We need to find out
more details of the product.

172
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,458
You do one thing,
take a date for the next month.

173
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,958
On 12th November.

174
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,541
Till then investigate all you want.

175
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,041
That’s exactly what I was saying, sir.
Thank you.

176
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,541
Case number 134,
Sitladevi Police Station, Narayan Kamble.

177
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,833
How can I give bail?

178
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,041
These are all non-bailable offences.

179
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,041
Sir, I request you to use

180
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,458
your discretion and grant conditional bail
to my client.

181
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,541
No, no… I can’t do it.

182
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,291
Sir, if you wish, you can put restrictions
on his further performances.

183
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,500
No, no.

184
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,458
This is a Sessions Court case.

185
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,125
12 days judicial custody for the accused.

186
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,541
Case number 135...

187
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,625
One minute, one minute...
what about these people?

188
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,291
They were travelling in the handicapped
compartment of a train.

189
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,833
-Do you all plead guilty?
-Yes, we do.

190
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,750
Okay, fine them 500 rupees each
and let them go.

191
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,166
Don’t do this again. Move. Move.

192
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,750
Come on.

193
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,750
MUMBAI PRESS ASSOCIATION

194
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>So I will conclude by saying that</i>

195
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,541
<i>if our constitution</i>
<i>believes in the right to life...</i>

196
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,541
<i>then it is the single most violated right.</i>

197
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:11,916
Because the conditions being created today
are not suitable for survival.

198
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,708
There is another word for such conditions,

199
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,625
but I will not use that word.

200
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,500
Otherwise,
I will be arrested for sedition.

201
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,416
Thank you, thank you very much.

202
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,625
Satyajit, thank you so much
for sharing your experiences with us.

203
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,708
That was very insightful,
and also very disturbing.

204
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,750
Next, we have advocate Vinay Vora.

205
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,541
He is a practising criminal lawyer,

206
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,541
who specialises in criminal justice
and human rights.

207
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,833
He is also one of the founding members
of a legal centre called Nidaan.

208
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,583
Ninaad.

209
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,875
Ninaad, I am sorry.

210
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,500
Good evening everyone.

211
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,666
Today I would like to talk to you
about the Mohsin Parvez case,

212
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,250
or rather multiple cases
in which I have been defending him

213
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,875
for the last five years.

214
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:02,041
Mohsin was first arrested in June 2007,

215
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,416
in connection
with the Kalyan bomb blast case.

216
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,791
Now, the police doesn’t have
any conclusive evidence

217
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,458
and they’ve rounded up 30-odd suspects,

218
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,833
based on...

219
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,166
Well, we know what.

220
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:17,125
Mohsin has four alibi witnesses
from his workplace.

221
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,791
So we fight the case, we manage to get
a clean chit by the courts,

222
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,583
and Mohsin is released from jail.

223
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,166
Now, two weeks later,

224
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,458
he is re-arrested from his home
on three entirely new charges.

225
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,875
We file a habeas corpus petition,
we manage to secure bail,

226
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,250
and the cases go on for two years.

227
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,958
Now it’s April 2010,

228
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:45,208
Mohsin is finally being released
by the courts without a single conviction.

229
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,416
On the day of his release,
he is stepping out of the jail,

230
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,541
and the moment he steps out,
they arrest him again.

231
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,333
Now, I asked the arresting officer
on what charges is he being arrested,

232
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,291
and they blurted some random charges,

233
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,791
and before we knew it,
they had just taken him away.

234
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,791
And at that point,
we realised that there was nothing

235
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,916
we could do to stop the arrest.

236
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,541
Now...

237
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,416
What is to be noted here,

238
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:15,000
is that this is the same modus operandi
used with Vijay Ghagre in Girjagiri,

239
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,000
Chandan Shirke in Malwapur,
and countless others.

240
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,666
Interrogation sessions lasting
12-14 hours at a stretch...

241
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,041
One minute sir...

242
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,708
Proceed.

243
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,041
The accused, Narayan Kamble, age 65,

244
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,250
is charged under Indian Penal Code,
Section 306,

245
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:01,125
Abetment of suicide,
in the death of Vasudev Pawar, age 25,

246
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,625
who was a worker under contract

247
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,250
with the Brihanmumbai
Municipal Corporation.

248
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:09,333
The deceased person committed suicide
on the night of 24th August, 2012,

249
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:13,833
by choking himself to death inside a sewer
located at Ram Vilas Road, Andheri East.

250
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,833
The police,
after its thorough investigation,

251
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,291
concluded in its report
that it was a clear case of suicide.

252
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,333
No manhole worker,

253
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,541
with an experience of doing the job
for five years, like the deceased,

254
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,833
would go inside the sewers
without any kind of protection

255
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,333
to eyes, nose, or skin.

256
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,291
These workers are fully aware of
the various hazardous gases

257
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,125
that breed inside the sewers,

258
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,791
and know that
they can lead to instant death

259
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,375
if proper precaution is not taken.

260
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,916
When the dead body of the deceased
was recovered from the sewer,

261
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:43,083
no safety equipment was found near him
even after searching for many hours.

262
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:47,166
No wounds, injuries, or signs of struggle
were found on Vasudev Pawar's body,

263
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,208
nor did the post-mortem show
any other cause for death,

264
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,333
other than the poisonous gases
which were inhaled.

265
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,958
According to Section 306,
if any person commits suicide,

266
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,125
whoever abets the commission
of such suicide,

267
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,125
shall be punished with imprisonment
of either description for a term

268
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,041
which may extend to ten years,

269
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:06,083
and shall also be liable to fine.

270
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:09,625
There is sufficient evidence
collected through police investigation,

271
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,333
as presented to your honour,

272
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,125
that the suicide of Vasudev Pawar

273
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,750
was provoked
by a performance of accused party,

274
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,208
Narayan Kamble and his troupe,

275
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,750
that took place at Sitladevi Nagar
on 21st August,

276
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:24,458
is the locality
in which the deceased resided,

277
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:27,625
and was seen in attendance
of the performance in question.

278
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,291
It should be noted
that the suicide took place

279
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,500
just two days after the performance.

280
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,250
As the statement of an eye-witness,

281
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,875
who is willing to testify
in this honourable court,

282
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,041
there was one song
performed by the accused,

283
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:43,166
which coaxed and encouraged
manhole workers to commit suicide

284
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:47,333
by deeply inhaling the toxic gases
found inside the sewers.

285
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,708
It is no coincidence

286
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:52,041
that the song in question
suggests exactly the method of suicide,

287
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:55,750
that is, deliberate negligence
of safety norms and regulations

288
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,916
by which the deceased took his life.

289
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,500
According to this song,

290
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,208
giving up your life
is the one and only rational solution

291
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,750
for certain sections of the society

292
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,958
to gain dignity and respect.

293
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,916
Here, Narayan Kamble is openly endorsing
and encouraging an act

294
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,666
which is an offence under Section 309.

295
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,333
I would also like to bring to
the attention of the honourable court,

296
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:21,125
that the accused has been previously
charged under Dramatic Performances Act,

297
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,791
and has been sufficiently warned
to not perform any material

298
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,375
that is seditious in nature,
or harmful to the general society.

299
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,958
In spite of these warnings,

300
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,291
the accused performed
the dramatic piece in question

301
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,750
without the approval
of concerned censor authorities,

302
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,458
and with the deliberate intent
of causing harm,

303
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,166
inciting seditious sentiments,

304
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:43,375
and corrupting people
present at the performance.

305
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,958
If the accused is granted bail

306
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,041
for this non-bailable
and non-compoundable offence,

307
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,541
there is a risk that he will once again
commit the same offence,

308
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:55,666
as his track record shows
complete disregard

309
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:58,375
and disrespect for the court's orders.

310
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,250
I’m done.

311
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:18,791
According to the report filed
by the investigating officer,

312
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:22,000
the death of Vasudev Pawar
is assumed to be an act of suicide.

313
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,833
I would like to request the court

314
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,625
to review this conclusion
critically in the light of evidence

315
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,833
that is highly inconclusive
and subjective.

316
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:35,416
As per Halsbury's Laws of England,
Fourth Edition, Ninth Volume, page 686,

317
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:39,208
a finding of suicide
must be on evidence of intention.

318
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,791
Every act of self-destruction is,
in common language,

319
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,625
described by the word 'suicide',

320
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,833
provided it is an intentional act

321
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,416
of a party knowing the probable
consequence of what he is about.

322
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,958
Suicide is never to be presumed.

323
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,958
Intention
is the essential legal ingredient.

324
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,833
To attract the ingredients of abetment,

325
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,958
the intention of the accused to aid,

326
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:04,000
or instigate, or abet the deceased
to commit suicide, is necessary.

327
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,083
In this case, let alone intention,

328
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,833
there is absolutely no logical reason
or motivation

329
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:12,666
as to why the accused
would abet the alleged suicide.

330
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,125
As for the Dramatic Performances Act,

331
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,875
which my colleague cited as grounds
for rejecting bail.

332
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,041
Your honour,
it's a Victorian law dating back to 1876,

333
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:27,458
and it’s up to our judgment about
its relevance in a post-colonial country.

334
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,416
No, but this is not a valid argument.
It is the law, it is there.

335
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:33,625
Secondly,

336
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:37,750
whether it was a dramatic performance
at all is also debatable,

337
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:41,500
because it was not a fictional
or a dramatised depiction of events.

338
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:46,083
In which case, whether it required
a censor certificate is a grey area.

339
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,916
But he has already been charged
under this act in the past.

340
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,166
So whether it’s a dramatic performance
or not,

341
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,750
has already been decided
by the honourable court.

342
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:59,375
Yes, you are right.
That has already been proved.

343
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,625
That is not a valid point.

344
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,000
Your honour, there is not a single witness
in the chargesheet

345
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,916
who claims to have seen
such a song being performed.

346
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,833
There is also no documentary evidence

347
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,250
whatsoever to support
the claims of the police,

348
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:16,166
and the burden is on the prosecution
to prove its case.

349
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,125
I would sincerely request the court

350
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,625
to discharge my client
at this stage itself,

351
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,000
and save him from further agony
of undergoing the trial.

352
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:25,250
In the alternative,

353
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,666
I would request your honour
to grant him bail.

354
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:32,500
Your honour,
there is prima facie sufficient evidence

355
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,708
to frame the charge against the accused,

356
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,458
and I strongly oppose
the request for bail.

357
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,875
Note...

358
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,083
Heard.

359
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,916
Fit case to frame charges.

360
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,000
Bail plea is to be rejected.

361
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:11,416
Next hearing on 11th November.

362
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,791
Have a look at the other side
of the documents as well.

363
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,000
Why are you doing all this
on the dining table?

364
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,000
You didn’t find any other place?

365
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,958
Where else to get hold of him?

366
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,833
I asked him to sign the papers,
he left them on the sofa.

367
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,333
But is this the place then?

368
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,166
The documents might get stained,
there is food next to it,

369
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:14,333
don’t you have any sense?

370
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,583
Tell him, don’t tell me.

371
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,333
He has ignored this work
for many months now.

372
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:21,041
But where have I come here
in all these days?

373
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,916
Then why haven’t you come?

374
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:25,333
Earlier at least you would come
on Sundays,

375
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,916
now you have stopped that as well.

376
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,958
Mom, don’t bore me, I am almost done here.

377
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,291
I tell you anything
and you reply with "Don’t bore me"…

378
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,083
For him it’s all a joke.

379
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,916
He is getting everything on a platter,
so there is no value.

380
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:44,833
You had promised I wouldn’t have
to hear all this nonsense.

381
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:49,583
Don’t talk about irrelevant things.
You are jumping from one thing to another.

382
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:54,208
Wow! Here I am taking your side
and you are fighting with me instead?

383
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,083
But why are you changing the topic?

384
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,250
What’s the topic? There is no topic.

385
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,375
I am getting late, I have to go.
Please just serve me the lunch.

386
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,458
Now are you going to vent
your anger over lunch?

387
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,875
Serve him quickly
or he will throw more tantrums.

388
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,500
-Yes, Subodh.
-Why are you instigating him again? One minute guys...
I’m talking on the phone!

389
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,708
Yes Subodh...

390
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,250
Yes, I'll open the door.

391
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,125
Just come inside.

392
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,333
Mom, please open the door.

393
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,250
Come in.

394
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,708
Come, Subodh.

395
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,750
No, I’ll sit here.

396
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,750
No, come join us for lunch.

397
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,875
Get a plate for him as well.

398
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,375
No, I just had lunch.

399
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,583
Please, it’s just awkward otherwise. Come.

400
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,875
The watchman didn’t cause a problem,
did he?

401
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,208
No uncle, nothing.

402
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,666
The thing is, the whole building is ours.

403
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:04,041
So if someone just mentions the name,
we have ordered him not to let them in.

404
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,458
If you say flat 308,
he will let you right in.

405
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,708
Yeah, he told me to say 308.

406
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,958
-What’s your name, son?
-Subodh Kushte.

407
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,875
-Are you Maharashtrian?
-Yes...

408
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,625
-Where is your hometown?
-Sutarwaadi.

409
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,750
Oh, this one I don't know.

410
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,833
Sorry about all this.

411
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,750
-We’ll leave in five minutes.
-It’s okay.

412
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,583
Are you his friend or client?

413
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:28,583
He's a friend.

414
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,583
-What do you do?
-I am doing M.Com.

415
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,000
Good, very good.

416
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:42,208
-You want some more curry?
-No aunty, I am fine.

417
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:46,541
You have come home for the first time,
we can’t just let you go like that.

418
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:56,791
Son, does he have a girlfriend?
He doesn’t tell us a thing at home.

419
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,000
-Mom have you gone mental?
-Whenever we talk marriage,

420
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,333
he gets angry.

421
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,000
See?

422
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,583
Are you out of your mind?
Have you gone mad?

423
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,541
I'm meeting this person
for the fourth time,

424
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:10,083
and you are asking him
such ridiculous questions about me?

425
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,791
But didn't you just say
he's a close friend?

426
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,250
You have all gone mad!

427
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,208
At least finish your food...

428
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,041
Yes, everyone is mad,
you are the only smart one.

429
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,458
It’s not right to leave
without eating your food.

430
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,708
-Let it be. He won't change.
-You please finish your food.

431
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,541
He’ll wait for you downstairs.
He won’t go without you.

432
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,750
-Please eat.
-No, no, aunty.

433
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,333
I’ll come another time.

434
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:37,291
You shouldn’t do this son...

435
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:39,083
How many times have I told you!

436
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,333
You can’t stop yourself
from instigating him.

437
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:45,000
Calm down. This is how he is.
He will never change.

438
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,166
Excuse me, where is room number 12?

439
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,166
That side.

440
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,291
Thank you.

441
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:44,291
Uncle, where is Vasudev’s house?
The fifth house from here.

442
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,416
Sister, which one is Vasudev’s house?

443
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,208
You wanted to meet Vasudev, is it?

444
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:24,208
Yes, is that his house?

445
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,291
Yes, that is his house
but there is no one there.

446
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,083
Where have they gone?

447
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,791
-Vasudev died.
-Yes, we know.

448
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:35,041
-What about the rest of the family?
-They've gone to their hometown.

449
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,291
Oh.

450
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:40,791
-Who all?
-His wife, two kids, and a brother too.

451
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:43,208
-The brother left as well?
-Yes, he did.

452
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,375
Anyway, he would be ill most of the time.

453
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,916
Did you have some work with him?

454
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,458
Yes, wanted to meet him.

455
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,208
We wanted to speak about Vasudev's death.

456
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,000
Yes, they had brought his body.

457
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,875
It was stinking so much
that no one was ready to touch it.

458
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,166
What had happened?

459
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,666
No one knew for sure...

460
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:05,416
Some people said that he must
have slipped in the gutter and died.

461
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:08,041
Some said he died of an insect bite
in the gutter.

462
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:11,291
-What did his family say?
-They also didn’t know for sure.

463
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,125
He died...

464
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:19,541
and within two days
his family left as well.

465
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,708
Did they say when they’ll be returning?

466
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:24,166
No, they didn’t.

467
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,166
-Shall I get you some water?
-No, no. I’m fine.

468
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,541
-You?
-No.

469
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,416
Thank you.

470
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,875
Let’s go...

471
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,416
Thank you...

472
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,083
The next song is an old Portuguese song,

473
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,500
which I picked up
from a street musician in Brazil.

474
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:39,625
I hope you all enjoy it...

475
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,458
-You want to cross-examine him?
-Yes.

476
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,500
Begin.

477
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,250
Thank you, your honour.

478
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:45,791
-Name?
-Narayan Kamble.

479
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,000
-Age?
-65 years.

480
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,833
-What do you do for a living?
-I’m a folk singer.

481
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,250
I conduct tuitions for students,
and a few workshops.

482
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,083
-What kind of workshops?
-For folk singers.

483
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,375
Where do they take place?

484
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,083
In Maharashtra: Jaitapur, Beed, Sangli...

485
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,625
Have you always been doing this,
or something else as well?

486
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,083
Excuse me your honour,
sorry for the interruption.

487
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:14,750
I would like to request my colleague
to converse either in Hindi or English.

488
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:18,916
Actually,
I will be more comfortable in Marathi.

489
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,000
You don’t worry,

490
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,958
I will translate it for you
if you don’t understand anything.

491
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,458
I used to work in a mill.

492
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,750
Did you quit the job or did you retire?

493
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,666
The mill got shut down.

494
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,458
-Do you get any pension?
-No.

495
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:42,791
You write every month
for a periodical called Tilak, right?

496
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:44,208
Yes.

497
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,750
So do you earn something from that?

498
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,250
Just a token amount.

499
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:52,541
What about getting paid
for your performances?

500
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,041
No.

501
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:57,458
Who pays for the stage
and sound equipment then?

502
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,166
We don’t always perform on stage.

503
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,375
Then where else?

504
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,250
On the roads, in slums, anywhere.

505
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:11,458
Are you associated
with any political or social group?

506
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,875
No, not in the last seven or eight years.

507
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,375
-So in the past you were, is it?
-Yes.

508
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,166
Which one?

509
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:21,958
Now there have been quite
a few over the years.

510
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,958
We have lots of time, tell us.

511
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:30,458
National Youth Party,
Dalit Progressive Movement,

512
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,666
Swaraj Mill Workers' Association.

513
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:38,666
Were you vice-president
of the MFS party in 1976?

514
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,083
Yes.

515
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,000
You were accused of
being an internal security threat,

516
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:45,833
and an arrest warrant
was issued in your name, correct?

517
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:46,916
Yes.

518
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:50,041
After that you went underground
for two years, correct?

519
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,916
Sir, I don’t understand how something
that happened 30 years ago

520
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:54,583
is relevant to the case.

521
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:58,041
If he was not convicted on these charges,
I don’t know why we are talking about it.

522
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,125
No, no. I think the court should know
the background of the accused.

523
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,333
Because of him, today somebody has died…

524
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,833
we need to know why these thoughts
are coming into his head.

525
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:10,416
Sir, my colleague is not bothered
about whether it really happened,

526
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:11,833
how it happened,

527
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:15,708
who saw it, where is the proof,
she’s going directly into the 'why' of it.

528
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:19,000
No, I am merely attempting to establish
the background of the accused.

529
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:22,625
If someone has a suspicious record
and criminal history,

530
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,625
then the court should know about it.

531
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:27,041
Let's move on now.

532
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:31,375
I have his records, I will look into them.
You talk about the case.

533
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,583
Okay, your honour.

534
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:41,125
Did you perform your show
on 21st August, 2012 in Sitladevi Nagar?

535
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,916
There wasn’t really a show or anything.

536
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,875
But you sang there, right?

537
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,416
Yes.

538
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:48,833
Proceed.

539
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,208
Why did you decide
on that particular location?

540
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,250
There was no specific reason.

541
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:58,208
There was some open space there
and so we decided to perform there.

542
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,083
While performing,
did you know that you were standing

543
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,416
right outside Vasudev Pawar’s house?

544
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,458
No.

545
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,041
-Did you know Vasudev Pawar?
-No.

546
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,500
Sukhdev,
will you please pass me that photo?

547
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,875
-Can you identify this man?
-No.

548
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,708
-Do you write all your songs yourself?
-Yes.

549
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:39,041
Have you ever written a song on suicide?

550
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:40,666
Yes.

551
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Did you perform a song on suicide
on 21st August, 2012?

552
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,333
I don’t remember.

553
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,958
That means you might have sung it?

554
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:53,833
Yes.

555
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:57,000
-Do you sing often on this theme?
-Yes.

556
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,958
So often that you don’t remember
whether you sang it that day or not?

557
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,125
Yes.

558
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:07,166
Tell me this... "Manhole workers,

559
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,125
all of us should commit suicide
by suffocating inside the gutters."

560
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,041
Did you perform a song
with this theme on that day?

561
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,500
No.

562
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,958
Okay then have you written
such a song ever?

563
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:21,833
Not yet.

564
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:24,958
So you might?
You don’t mind writing such a song?

565
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,000
No.

566
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:31,958
We are not joking here,
you are standing in a court.

567
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,250
All of this is going on record.

568
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,750
Did you understand what he said just now?

569
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,375
Yes I did your honour.

570
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,375
Note...

571
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,291
The accused is claiming

572
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:50,958
that although he has never written

573
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,708
or performed such a song yet,

574
00:45:54,833 --> 00:46:01,125
he doesn’t mind doing it either.

575
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,416
This is tough.

576
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:06,250
I love your saree. It’s very pretty.

577
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:09,750
Isn’t it?
And it’s comfortable because it’s cotton.

578
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:13,541
What happened is,
I saw it on display in a store,

579
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:16,916
I liked it so much
that I immediately bought it.

580
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:20,958
Where is the time to go shopping
otherwise?

581
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,250
Anyway, the markets are so crowded.

582
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:27,625
True. You really can’t decide what to buy.

583
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,083
So, what about tonight's dinner?

584
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,916
The same, will have to go home and cook.

585
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,875
Since my mister was diagnosed
with diabetes,

586
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,833
we have cut down on oily and sweet foods.

587
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:48,416
Obviously, the kids crib sometimes,
"Why do we have to suffer" and all...

588
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,708
But once it’s there,
you are tempted to eat.

589
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,291
Yes, true.

590
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,916
In our house, we don’t have any illnesses

591
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,375
but I’m still careful.

592
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:03,375
For the bread,
they have this multi-grain flour now.

593
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,375
I have started using that. Let's see.

594
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:08,583
But does it taste good?

595
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,916
You can’t make out the difference.
And it’s good for health.

596
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:17,291
Even Vaibhavi was telling me…

597
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:19,958
"Mummy we should use olive oil,
it’s better."

598
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:22,375
It’s better, but so expensive.

599
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:26,708
If we use it everyday,
we will go bankrupt.

600
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:31,791
But the one they sell on TV
didn't seem that expensive.

601
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:35,208
Oh, don’t buy the one on TV.

602
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:38,333
So many people told me
that they got duped.

603
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,375
-Not worth it.
-Yeah.

604
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:44,625
These days it's hard to trust anybody.

605
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,083
Tara ma'am?

606
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:12,250
Yes, one minute.
Rohan, your mother's here.

607
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:21,291
-Did he have lunch?
-Yes, he did.

608
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:31,416
Take your water bottle.

609
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:42,458
-Bye.
-Bye.

610
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,666
-See you.
-Bye.

611
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,250
Don’t drag the bottle.

612
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,250
What's your homework for today?

613
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,791
I have to write an essay
on the kite festival in English...

614
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:16,541
and an essay on the New Year in Marathi.

615
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:20,541
-What about maths?
-No homework for maths.

616
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:25,083
-This way.
-Why this way?

617
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:28,791
We have to go towards the station.
Have to pick up groceries.

618
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:50,125
But I had warned her, don’t trust anyone.

619
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,125
Now she is regretting.

620
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,916
Ultimately they are not blood relatives.

621
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,666
No, why do you need to say anything?

622
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:14,166
You don't get involved in this.

623
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:26,291
You tell them, "Get your papers in order
and then I will sign."

624
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:30,000
Sure, I will have a look at them.

625
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:33,333
Yes, call me tomorrow.

626
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:38,291
Okay, okay… bye.

627
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,875
The salad is ready.

628
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,166
Enough.

629
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,166
-You want some more gravy?
-No.

630
00:51:58,375 --> 00:51:59,500
It’s not good?

631
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,291
Son, why don't you eat
while the bread is still hot...

632
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:04,291
I’ll have it later, let dad finish.

633
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,000
-What about you?
-Get me rice.

634
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:57,375
We are building a Hanuman temple
in our neighbourhood.

635
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,833
They are celebrating the Hanuman festival.

636
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:04,708
I’m not taking part in the organisation,
but I’m encouraging the youngsters…

637
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:10,375
At least that way they will get together.
Let's see how it goes...

638
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:14,208
-You want some?
-No, thank you.

639
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:18,541
Okay, I need to get going.

640
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,458
-Which case today?
-That Narayan Kamble one.

641
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,541
-Who’s the judge? Mr. Sadavarte?
-Yes.

642
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:25,625
He’s very sharp.

643
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,375
All that’s fine, but he should
quickly pass the judgment now.

644
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,250
But Sadavarte’s speed is fast.

645
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,875
Now, these judges
like Gaonkar, Sarpotdar, etc.

646
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:39,291
Their speed is hardly three,
three and a half cases per day.

647
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:43,250
But I have heard Sadavarte
clocked in five cases per day last year.

648
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,041
But things still take
their own sweet time.

649
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,791
For example,
take this Narayan Kamble case...

650
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:52,458
Simply throw him in jail for 20 years
and finish the matter.

651
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:56,541
The same faces, the same stories,
it's boring.

652
00:53:57,875 --> 00:54:02,125
Madam wants to see new faces everyday.
Let's make her a judge soon.

653
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,208
Oh, please do. God bless.

654
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:43,000
Have both your witnesses
come today at least?

655
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,875
Only one has come.

656
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:49,291
-What about the other?
-He’s ill.

657
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,333
Okay, you can start.

658
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,291
State your name and age.

659
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,750
Shankar Bhoir, 41.

660
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:10,750
What is your occupation?

661
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,166
I am a tailor.

662
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:20,250
Did you see Narayan Kamble
on the day stated in the report?

663
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:24,333
Yes I saw him, he was singing.

664
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:29,791
-Where?
-In Andheri East, near JB Colony.

665
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,333
Do you mean Sitladevi Nagar?

666
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,125
Yes.

667
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,375
What were you doing there?

668
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,541
I had gone to meet my brother.

669
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:42,416
Tell us about his songs,
what was he singing?

670
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:47,541
He was singing.
The content was very obscene.

671
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:50,750
-And?
-And...

672
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:54,083
He was screaming and yelling.

673
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:58,166
-What was he saying?
-He was saying...

674
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:04,125
"Die, die. Let's drown in the gutters,
let’s all die," things like that.

675
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:08,791
Was he talking about any specific person
or community?

676
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,250
Objection your honour.

677
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:12,125
She is clearly leading the witness,

678
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,708
she is feeding him the location,
she is telling him what to say.

679
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,625
No, no I am not leading him anywhere.

680
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,208
All this is already mentioned
in his statement.

681
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:23,875
You just ask him the questions,
don’t say anything else.

682
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:25,291
Okay.

683
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:34,125
So tell us in detail, what was he saying
and who was he referring to...

684
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:37,083
He was saying…

685
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,500
He was talking about some workers.

686
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:47,125
-Was this man present at the event?
-Yes.

687
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,125
At least give it a good look.

688
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:51,041
Look at it carefully. Yes.

689
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,000
-Do you remember seeing him for sure?
-Yes.

690
00:56:58,916 --> 00:56:59,875
Note...

691
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:05,875
Witness Shankar Bhoir
heard Narayan Kamble perform a song,

692
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:13,666
where he roused workers to give up
their lives by drowning in the gutters.

693
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:19,250
The witness also saw Vasudev Pawar

694
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:21,875
attending this show.

695
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,458
When will your other witness
come to court?

696
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:30,083
I’ll bring him next time.

697
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,458
He’s been sick the whole month?

698
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:35,541
Yes sir.
But next time, I’ll get him for sure.

699
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,083
Okay, I’ll give the next date then.

700
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:43,958
Ninth January.

701
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,708
-Fine with you?
-Yes

702
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:00,583
Case number 375, Mercy Fernandes.

703
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,791
-Your case will not be heard today.
-Why sir?

704
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,500
You have come wearing a sleeveless top
to the court hearing.

705
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:22,458
This is against the code of conduct
in court.

706
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,916
Only modest dressing and sober colours
are allowed.

707
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:31,041
-This isn’t allowed in court.
-Please reconsider sir.

708
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,708
No, it’s against the rules.

709
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:40,791
Case number 376, Santosh Waghmare.

710
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,750
Is it spicy?

711
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:33,750
Chew properly.

712
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,958
-Got the tickets?
-Yes, we did.

713
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,458
-Good seats?
-Yes.

714
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:55,916
Next time, we’ll come to see
this children’s play.

715
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,375
-Okay when is it?
-On Sunday.

716
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:01,208
-What time is it?
-11 a.m.

717
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:41,875
Dad! What are you doing?
Relax! Please sit here.

718
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:45,916
I’ll explain everything to you.
Just sit here for a moment.

719
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,458
Dad, I’ve decided to get married.

720
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,916
With this man?

721
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:55,708
Of course not! This is the father.

722
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,416
-Prem?
-Yes, darling?

723
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,250
Can you come out for a minute?

724
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:03,458
<i>The bride will be taken</i>

725
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:07,208
<i>Taken home, by the North Indians</i>

726
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:10,458
What are you doing? Shut up.
This is my father.

727
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:12,333
Prem.

728
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,083
Sit here son.

729
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:19,208
Ah, jasmine oil in your hair.

730
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:20,916
Dear son...

731
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:26,958
You call my daughter 'darling'...
at least tell me your full name.

732
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,000
-Prem Chaubey...
-Chaubal!

733
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:31,875
Where do you stay?

734
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,833
-Bareilly...
-Borivali!

735
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,500
Who all are there in your family?

736
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:38,250
Mom, dad, bro…

737
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,458
-'Bro'!
-Whoa!

738
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:43,958
Mom, dad, brother.

739
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:47,791
And what do you do for a living?

740
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,875
-Snacks vendor.
-Catering!

741
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,750
He’s done engineering in catering.

742
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,333
Do one thing, Meenu,

743
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:01,833
go inside and make tea for all of us.

744
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,708
Move, move.

745
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:07,625
You go with her too. Brew some exotic tea.

746
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,000
Quickly, quickly.

747
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:13,375
Come.

748
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:17,250
You immigrants!

749
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,625
First, you took our jobs from us.

750
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:23,666
Then you took away our land.

751
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:28,083
And now you want our daughters as well?

752
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:31,750
Get lost!

753
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,708
Get lost! Go!

754
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:45,458
These immigrants tend to mistake our grace

755
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,833
for our weakness.

756
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:50,291
But if pushed,

757
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:56,125
this Marathi man can easily show them
who is the boss in this city.

758
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,958
How did Narayan Kamble’s name
come up in your investigation?

759
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:27,875
We had gone to Vasudev’s house
for enquiry,

760
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,333
that's when someone mentioned it.

761
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,625
Mentioned what?

762
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:38,250
That two days ago,
Narayan Kamble had performed the song,

763
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:40,208
after which Vasudev committed suicide.

764
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:42,416
Who told you this?

765
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:45,666
Someone called Nilesh Tawde, he told us.

766
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:48,333
Then, we got Shankar Bhoir as a witness.

767
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,458
Nilesh Tawde lives in the same slum?

768
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,625
Yes, he lives there
and he knew Vasudev Pawar.

769
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,541
Then why isn’t Nilesh Tawde’s statement
included in the report?

770
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:05,208
We had recorded the statement
but later he withdrew it.

771
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:10,166
Yes, he withdrew it,
but where is the statement?

772
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:11,583
That we’ll have to look for.

773
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:13,625
How does that make sense?

774
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:16,541
Why didn’t you submit the old statement?

775
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:17,916
I’ll look into the matter.

776
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:20,708
When is that man coming to court?

777
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,833
I’ll get him next time.

778
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:24,708
Then what do we do till then?

779
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:28,125
No old statement, no new statement,

780
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:30,041
and no sign of the person either...

781
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,041
We keep waiting on this one case
for years?

782
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:34,916
No, no, I’ll do something.

783
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:36,708
Continue.

784
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,666
Thank you, your honour.

785
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:40,708
So tell me...

786
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,875
Someone told you
that Vasudev heard Narayan's song,

787
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,041
then how did you go about investigating?

788
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:50,416
We went to Narayan Kamble's house
and conducted a search.

789
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:54,250
-Was he present at home?
-No.

790
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,500
Then how did you enter?

791
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
His grand-daughter was there.

792
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,625
Did you have a search warrant?

793
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,250
No.

794
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:06,291
Your honour, the search conducted
at my client's house was illegal.

795
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:08,458
The investigating officer
did not have a search warrant,

796
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:11,208
and the search was conducted
in the presence of a minor,

797
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,791
who was alone in the house.

798
01:05:12,916 --> 01:05:16,333
How can you presume the suspect
will not co-operate?

799
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,916
You have been given
the police procedure manual, right?

800
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,458
-Yes.
-Then what’s the point of it?

801
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:26,583
You are right.

802
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:29,083
And what about the Ashwin Bhagat letter?

803
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,875
Do you want to question him about that?

804
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,166
Yes, your honour.

805
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,583
Have you read the letter?

806
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:36,375
Yes.

807
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,416
Can you tell us
what is written in the letter?

808
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:43,666
Ashwin Bhagat had written it
from inside Arthur Road Jail.

809
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,416
Yes, but what had he written?

810
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:49,458
In that, Ashwin Bhagat had abused

811
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:52,500
the jail superintendent
and other police officials.

812
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:55,458
Abused them or complained about them?

813
01:05:56,541 --> 01:05:58,541
-The same thing.
-And?

814
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,583
There was mention of a plan.

815
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:05,500
These people were going to do something
in the city.

816
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:06,625
Who exactly?

817
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:10,250
Ashwin Bhagat, Narayan Kamble,
and their associates.

818
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:14,375
Your honour, I have a translated version
of the letter here with me...

819
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:17,291
In the letter,
Mr. Bhagat is requesting my client

820
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:20,208
to take care of his ailing mother
while he is in jail.

821
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,791
I don't see
what illegal activity or planning

822
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:25,666
the officer is talking about.

823
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:29,083
No, but these people are smart.

824
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,208
They write in code language.

825
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:35,958
-What do you mean by 'these people'?
-I mean extremists.

826
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:38,791
Who told you
Narayan Kamble is an extremist?

827
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:42,041
Not Narayan Kamble,
but Ashwin Bhagat definitely is.

828
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:43,625
That has been proven.

829
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:47,083
Okay, so what have they written
in code language?

830
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,416
That we can't figure out right now.

831
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:53,000
Ashwin Bhagat has a proven record
of doing such things.

832
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:58,375
We’ve given the letter
to the Intelligence Department...

833
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:00,708
They will find out.

834
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:05,291
'Find out' as in when will they find out?

835
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:07,791
It will at least take a month, sir. We will talk about it then.

836
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:11,916
What’s the point of shooting in the dark?

837
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:14,375
You want to continue?

838
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:15,958
No, I’m done sir.

839
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:17,625
Okay.

840
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,000
I'll take your leave, sir.

841
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:21,666
And what about those books?

842
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:30,791
Your honour, 40 books were seized
from Narayan Kamble's residence.

843
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:33,541
Out of that,
two are banned by the government,

844
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,166
and illegal to own.

845
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,875
One is a manuscript called Goymar Manas,
by Saint Kashinath, written in 1899.

846
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:42,541
The other is a book

847
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:45,291
called <i>The Lotus and the Robot</i>,
by Arthur Koestler.

848
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:47,166
Sir, I must tell you,

849
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:50,541
<i>The Lotus and the Robot</i>
is about oriental yoga,

850
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,041
and Goymar Manas is about the history
of the Goymari sect.

851
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,833
Goymar Manas is banned

852
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,416
because it hurts the sentiments
of Goymari people,

853
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,958
and is considered to be offensive.

854
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:04,208
What are you saying?
Why don't you speak in English?

855
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,625
It is considered to be very offensive.

856
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,500
Sir, the book was banned
over a 110 years ago,

857
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,833
and in its time,
it was considered a very accurate critique

858
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:16,041
of some regressive Goymari practices.

859
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:20,333
It may be regressive for you,
but for them, it is still sacred.

860
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:23,375
Yes, but it is still harmful
and irrational.

861
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:28,041
Your honour, how can he say that?
This is very insulting.

862
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:30,166
How is this insulting?

863
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:32,750
Stop this discussion please.

864
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:34,791
I will see what to do about the books.

865
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:38,041
Take the next date...

866
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:41,041
25th January.

867
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:50,125
CHETANA -THE RESTAURANT

868
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:04,625
Did you face problems
with the customs officials?

869
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,416
I did, daddy.

870
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:10,125
I told mummy,
they confiscated her phone...

871
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,333
-I don’t know a thing.
-I didn’t tell him anything.

872
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:18,916
It was very problematic.
They took away mummy's phone.

873
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:21,250
-Oh, very good.
-What very good?

874
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:24,583
-We lost mom’s phone and…
-Yes, but why ask for it?

875
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:28,666
I didn’t tell him you bought the things,

876
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:31,625
or that they got confiscated.

877
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,500
Good he didn't know.
He takes pleasure in these things.

878
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:38,833
Moreover, they confiscated
Magan uncle’s daughter's gifts.

879
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:41,375
That’s why
I don’t call for anything from abroad.

880
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,541
Everything is available in India.
No need to import.

881
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:47,958
But relatives don’t understand.
Mummy is okay...

882
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:51,458
You didn’t ask me for anything
because you understand.

883
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:54,000
But this Magan uncle’s daughter doesn’t.

884
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,500
Kept calling me all the time...

885
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,166
and if I don’t answer, she’d leave
messages on the answering machine...

886
01:09:58,291 --> 01:09:59,208
"Get me an iPad... "

887
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:02,250
They think it’s like travelling
in local trains.

888
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,250
No customs to deal with.

889
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,541
Get him! Don't let him go.

890
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:35,708
Get him!

891
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:44,208
How dare you insult the Goymari sect!

892
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:45,666
Blacken his face!

893
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:49,750
All hail the Goymari sect!
Long live the Goymari people!

894
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:17,916
Madam, it's getting late now.

895
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,791
No, they've just arrived. We can start.

896
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:26,375
Sit.

897
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:42,750
Proceed...

898
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:47,000
Your honour, I would like to call
Sharmila Vasudev Pawar,

899
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:50,041
wife of Vasudev Dnyanesh Pawar,
to the stand.

900
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,416
Permission granted.

901
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:53,916
Come.

902
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:07,041
Where were you all these days?

903
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:11,958
In my hometown.

904
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:14,958
Where is your hometown?

905
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:17,125
Shiknapur.

906
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:20,166
How come you left?

907
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:23,916
Your husband died,
there was a police case...

908
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:27,458
After the autopsy,
no one claimed the body either.

909
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,041
When did you return?

910
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:33,250
Last week.

911
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,333
How did you find her?

912
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:41,041
The neighbours informed her
that we were looking for her.

913
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,583
Then her brother-in-law
brought her to the station. Why did you leave for the village?

914
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,250
Because I was...

915
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:51,500
What? Because you were what?

916
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:53,250
Because I was scared.

917
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,375
Who did you go with?

918
01:13:56,791 --> 01:13:58,708
With my brother-in-law and daughter.

919
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:04,541
Now don’t leave without informing us,
till the case is on.

920
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:10,041
-Ask what you have to.
-Thank you, your honour.

921
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:14,166
-State your name and age.
-Sharmila Pawar.

922
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:16,375
-Age?
-I don’t know.

923
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,208
Still, approximately?

924
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:20,250
Thirty.

925
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:26,458
For how many years
were you married to Vasudev Pawar?

926
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:27,583
Seven.

927
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:33,583
From the time you got married,
did Vasudev always clean gutters?

928
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:34,666
Yes.

929
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:38,083
Meaning he was used to this job?

930
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,166
During these years,
there were no accidents or injuries

931
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:44,750
while doing the job, right?

932
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:46,875
He had lost one eye.

933
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,083
-How?
-Don’t know.

934
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,666
Was it an accident while working...

935
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:55,041
Or something went into his eye,
or something like that?

936
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:56,125
No.

937
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:01,125
So there was no accident
while on the job, right?

938
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,708
It was not as if
he had ever slipped inside,

939
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:07,958
or carelessly entered the gutters, right?

940
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:15,083
Okay. Now tell me... how was
your husband’s mental condition?

941
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:17,375
As in?

942
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:23,291
As in, would he be happy, or sad,
or how would he be?

943
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:25,125
He would be okay.

944
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:27,541
He would be okay?

945
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:30,958
-He wouldn’t fight or anything?
-Yes, he would.

946
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,250
-Would he ever beat you?
-Sometimes he would.

947
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,791
-Would he beat the kids?
-Yes.

948
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:41,833
Okay, now tell me...

949
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:46,458
Did he ever talk to you about suicide?

950
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:49,333
-No.
-No?

951
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:54,166
Then did he ever mention a song
or anything of that sort?

952
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,875
No? Okay.

953
01:15:57,208 --> 01:16:01,291
How about a person,
someone called Narayan Kamble?

954
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:03,916
-Did he ever mention him?
-No.

955
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:06,375
Sir, what is happening?
She is leading the witness.

956
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,291
I’m not leading her anywhere.

957
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:10,708
Okay… move on.

958
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,083
Now tell me...

959
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:22,291
Do you remember any person or group

960
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:25,541
performing something outside your house?

961
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:27,833
I don’t know.

962
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:31,000
Are you sure or are you just
saying 'no no' for everything?

963
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,666
I can’t remember.

964
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,666
Your honour, I think she is nervous,
and not able to recollect any details.

965
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,750
I request another date for questioning.

966
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:46,208
Okay...

967
01:16:47,166 --> 01:16:50,250
Do you want to ask her anything right now
or next time only?

968
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:54,875
Your honour, I have a few questions
I want to ask her,

969
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,333
but only if she is okay with it.

970
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:03,291
He is going to ask you
a few more questions, is that okay?

971
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,833
Proceed.

972
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:16,958
When your husband would go to work,

973
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:20,416
would he wear something
to cover his mouth, eyes?

974
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:22,708
No.

975
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:27,708
Gum boots, or a mask, or something?

976
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:28,833
No.

977
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:33,208
-Then how would he enter the gutters?
-He would just enter.

978
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,000
But...

979
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:40,041
Isn’t it full of dirt and stench inside?

980
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:43,083
Yes, but he would look for cockroaches.

981
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,583
As in?

982
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:47,500
As in, he would throw pebbles
inside the gutter,

983
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:52,541
and if a cockroach or a bug came out,
he knew it was safe to go in.

984
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,416
How do you know this?

985
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:59,875
Sometimes he would come home and say,

986
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,750
"The cockroach didn’t come out today,
so it's a holiday."

987
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:07,375
What would he use to clean the gutter?

988
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:12,500
Anything like a spade or a rod...

989
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:14,541
Wasn't he given anything else?

990
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:15,666
No.

991
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:20,958
Just now, you said he had lost an eye...
How did that happen?

992
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:22,833
We couldn’t know exactly.

993
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:26,041
The doctor said it was
because of the dirt that went in his eye.

994
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,750
-Because of entering the sewers?
-Yes.

995
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,708
Isn’t he leading the witness now? Please, please don’t do this.

996
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,583
Okay.

997
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:39,666
-Did he consume alcohol?
-Yes.

998
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:43,291
-How many times a week?
-Everyday.

999
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:48,625
-Before work or after work?
-Before work.

1000
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:50,583
Why?

1001
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:53,708
To bear the stench of the gutter.

1002
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:57,333
Thank you.

1003
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,041
Your honour...

1004
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:03,625
No safety equipment
was ever provided to Vasudev Pawar.

1005
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:08,000
He had to rely on alcohol
to stand the stench in the gutters.

1006
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,541
And he had no reliable way of knowing

1007
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:13,916
if there was enough oxygen inside
for him to go in.

1008
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,583
Also, he had already lost an eye
due to an infection

1009
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:18,333
caused by the poisonous gases.

1010
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:24,666
Note...

1011
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:27,708
The deceased...

1012
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:33,375
was not provided
with any safety equipment.

1013
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:40,708
This is as per his wife's statement.

1014
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:49,500
This may have led to the loss

1015
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:57,500
of an eye during work.

1016
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:31,583
Please wear the seatbelt.

1017
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:36,833
On your left. There.

1018
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,583
I should drop you
at Sitladevi Nagar, right?

1019
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:23,250
Yes.

1020
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,875
How many times will I have to come
to the court like this?

1021
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,041
Maybe once or twice more.

1022
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:44,958
I don’t have much work as it is.

1023
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:48,708
If I have to keep coming here,
I’ll lose whatever I have in hand.

1024
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:52,333
When I left for my village,
I lost all my work here.

1025
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,875
If there is some work for me,
please let me know.

1026
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,250
Yes, I will.

1027
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:58,666
I am ready to work anywhere.

1028
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:11,833
If you need some money,
then I can arrange for it…

1029
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:15,291
No, I don't want money.
Just let me know if there's work for me...

1030
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,083
Okay.

1031
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:52,833
Your honour,
according to the autopsy report

1032
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,500
submitted by the hospital,

1033
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:57,875
the cause of death
in the case of Vasudev Pawar

1034
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,208
was respiratory failure due to inhalation
of the poisonous gas Hydrogen Sulphide,

1035
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,875
that was found inside his lungs
in an excessive amount. There is a possibility
that the oxygen levels in his body

1036
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:12,375
had dropped below six percent,

1037
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:16,250
resulting in unconsciousness,
or a state of coma before dying.

1038
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:20,583
No injury marks or physical wounds
were found on his body,

1039
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:23,541
and there were no signs
of internal bleeding.

1040
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:26,791
The report suggests that

1041
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:30,750
the victim was in a heavily
inebriated state at the time of death,

1042
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:35,083
and a significant amount of alcohol
was found in the victim’s blood stream.

1043
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:39,708
This negates the possibility
of a pre-meditated suicide

1044
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,375
and indicates an accidental death.

1045
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,000
No suicide letter has been found,

1046
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:49,583
or any witness in whom the victim
had confided about giving up his life.

1047
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,291
Madam...

1048
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:58,666
Your case has become very weak.

1049
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:01,500
The only witness you have
is Shankar Bhoir.

1050
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:04,208
Sir, I have a point
to make about that also.

1051
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:08,625
Your honour,
Shankar Bhoir is a stock witness.

1052
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:13,166
He has served as an eye-witness
in four other cases in the last two years.

1053
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:16,541
They are, State vs Mohammed Aslam,

1054
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:20,208
State vs Gajendra Kamat,
State vs Krutika Modi.

1055
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:23,625
And in all four cases, including this one,

1056
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,250
the investigating officer
happens to be the same,

1057
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,416
Pradeep Shelke.

1058
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:31,125
I have no idea about this, your honour.
I will look into this matter.

1059
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:32,458
Please do so. Proceed.

1060
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:39,125
Apart from that single witness
your honour,

1061
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:42,708
there is no conclusive evidence
linking my client’s performance

1062
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,583
to the death of Vasudev Pawar.

1063
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:48,166
In strong defence of my client
are the statements

1064
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:49,625
given by his troupe members,

1065
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:54,000
Subodh Kushte, Sachin Jadhav,
Pallavi Sonar, and Vidya Sawant,

1066
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:58,000
who claim that they had no knowledge
of the song in question

1067
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:00,875
ever been written or performed
by the accused.

1068
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,666
Most importantly, Sharmila Pawar,

1069
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:07,541
wife of Vasudev Pawar,
has testified in court

1070
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:12,083
that her husband had not expressed
any intention of committing suicide,

1071
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:16,958
nor did she know of any circumstances
that would lead him to such an act.

1072
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:21,541
If anything, her statement
only strengthened the possibility

1073
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:23,541
of the death being an accident

1074
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:28,500
caused under the influence of alcohol,
and negligence of safety norms.

1075
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:34,833
Your honour, I would sincerely request you
to grant my client bail,

1076
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:38,333
and also take into consideration his age,

1077
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:41,458
as medical reports show

1078
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:44,291
his health
has been deteriorating severely.

1079
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:55,625
Bail granted.

1080
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,666
Thank you, your honour.

1081
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:02,708
Set at 100,000 rupees. Cash only,

1082
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:05,541
without sureties.

1083
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:10,083
Your honour, I’m not sure if my client
can arrange for such a high amount.

1084
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:13,916
He has jumped bail in previous cases.

1085
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:17,958
Amount cannot be lowered.

1086
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:34,000
Case number 187, Abbas Ali Ansari.

1087
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:00,833
What’s written in this?

1088
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:05,791
You have to report every week
at the Sitladevi Nagar Police Station.

1089
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,083
You can’t leave the city
and you can’t change your residence.

1090
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:12,083
-Who paid the bail?
-He did.

1091
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:15,625
-Then arrange for paying it back.
-Yes, I will see.

1092
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,583
Why did you pay so much money?

1093
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,208
We would have arranged something.

1094
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:24,125
Now this case is going to go on for years.
Pay me when you can.

1095
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:25,791
But still...

1096
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:27,458
Here.

1097
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:32,416
Why so many pills?
I just took some an hour ago.

1098
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,583
They said take these again.

1099
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:39,875
I have no idea what medicines
they are asking me to take.

1100
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,875
Really?

1101
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:43,125
The doctor asked him to take an injection.

1102
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,750
He is refusing that, which is why
he has to take all these pills.

1103
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:48,250
-Why is he refusing?
-He is scared of injections.

1104
01:28:48,375 --> 01:28:51,458
I am not scared, I just don’t like it.

1105
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:54,000
Are injections meant to be liked?

1106
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:00,291
-Have the reports come in?
-Yes, they have.

1107
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:03,583
His blood pressure has shot up
and he has fever as well.

1108
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:05,625
Doctors are saying it could be jaundice...

1109
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:12,000
Nana,
please lie low for the next few days.

1110
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:15,000
Otherwise they will cancel the bail again.

1111
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:18,916
Don’t just say 'hmm',
listen to what he is saying.

1112
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:22,208
If they arrest you again and something
goes wrong in the jail, what will we do?

1113
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:24,416
What’s the point of being so scared?

1114
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,208
We will see what happens.

1115
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:28,541
But all of us get affected.

1116
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:36,958
Nana, I’ll take your leave now.
You please rest.

1117
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:38,958
Subodh...

1118
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,750
Come out.

1119
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:42,541
I’ll be back.

1120
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,708
<i>How blessed you are, O Lord!</i>

1121
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:05,458
<i>How blessed you are, O Lord</i>
<i>With love that’s infinity</i>

1122
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:08,291
<i>Lots of pity</i>
<i>Lots of empathy</i>

1123
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:12,666
<i>Paeans are sung about your courage</i>

1124
01:30:12,791 --> 01:30:15,041
<i>But this is a ballad of your kindness</i>

1125
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:18,666
<i>I present this ballad of gratitude</i>

1126
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:23,291
<i>So listen to this ballad of gratitude,</i>
<i>O Lord</i>

1127
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:27,000
<i>How you wield the sword</i>
<i>That stabs the heart</i>

1128
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:28,416
<i>That smashes all life!</i>

1129
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:31,750
<i>O Lord, our master</i>
<i>O Lord, our master</i>

1130
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:35,500
<i>With one shot of your gun</i>
<i>The best of people are downed</i>

1131
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:36,666
<i>Down in the dumps!</i>

1132
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:40,041
<i>O Lord, our master</i>
<i>O Lord, our master</i>

1133
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:42,833
<i>Yet you did not muffle me</i>

1134
01:30:42,958 --> 01:30:45,291
<i>Showed the courtesy to try me in court</i>

1135
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:48,875
<i>How you rendered a favour onto me</i>

1136
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,416
<i>O, how you rendered a favour to me</i>

1137
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:57,000
<i>Admist all this noise about the arts</i>

1138
01:30:57,125 --> 01:31:01,500
<i>Truth has lost its voice</i>

1139
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:05,791
<i>Art is your hogwash</i>
<i>A deception in the name of aesthetics</i>

1140
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:15,750
<i>Screams from the funeral pyre...</i>

1141
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,166
<i>cannot be called a performance</i>

1142
01:31:22,291 --> 01:31:26,708
<i>We will genuinely be obliged...</i>

1143
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:30,083
<i>If you do not label us: 'Artists'</i>

1144
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:42,333
And now for tonight’s last item.

1145
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:45,083
Dance performance of under-15 girls.

1146
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:48,083
Big round of applause!

1147
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:17,416
A HISTORY OF HUMILIATION
BY NARAYAN KAMBLE

1148
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:39,666
Mr. Kadam...

1149
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:46,875
Hand over these papers to him.

1150
01:34:56,458 --> 01:35:00,583
You don’t have to come now.
We will let you know if we need you.

1151
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:07,791
Case number 535,
Paanchpada Police Station,

1152
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:09,375
Narayan Kamble.

1153
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:48,500
Three days police custody.

1154
01:36:02,708 --> 01:36:04,958
Case number 536,
Paanchpada Police Station,

1155
01:36:05,083 --> 01:36:06,125
Amit Sawant. Proceed.

1156
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:34,250
The accused, Narayan Kamble,

1157
01:36:34,375 --> 01:36:37,166
is charged under Section 124-A
of the Indian Penal Code

1158
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:40,833
i.e. The Unlawful Activities
Prevention Act, 1967,

1159
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:44,166
The Unlawful Activities
Prevention Amendment Act, 2008

1160
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:47,333
and Section 151, Indian Penal Code, 1860.

1161
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:51,500
He has been found to conduct seditious
camps indoctrinating state youth members

1162
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:54,666
in various areas such as Beed, Sangli,
Mumbai, and Jaitapur.

1163
01:36:55,291 --> 01:36:57,833
These camps have been operating
under the cover of workshops

1164
01:36:57,958 --> 01:36:59,541
for folk artists and poets.

1165
01:36:59,666 --> 01:37:02,625
Evidence has been found in the form
of exchanged correspondence,

1166
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:04,375
poems, songs, and manuscripts,

1167
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,875
that these camps have very little to do
with the folk culture of the state,

1168
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,625
and are instead vehicles
of organising meetings

1169
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,666
for potentially dangerous individuals.

1170
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:14,458
According to the police investigations,

1171
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:18,458
the key members involved in helping
Narayan Kamble conducting these workshops

1172
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:22,875
are Subodh Kushte, Swati Shirke,
Vikas Saraf, and Anand Jadhav.

1173
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,208
All the above mentioned people
have several cases filed against them

1174
01:37:26,333 --> 01:37:27,708
in various parts of the state,

1175
01:37:27,833 --> 01:37:30,041
and are known
to be associated with outfits

1176
01:37:30,166 --> 01:37:32,625
that have been termed
as terrorist organisations

1177
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,541
by the Government of India.

1178
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:37,458
The police investigation further states

1179
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:41,000
that many of the so-called artists,
who have been trained under the accused,

1180
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:44,750
have been responsible
for violent protests, property damage,

1181
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:49,000
and even attacking police officials
in the above mentioned areas.

1182
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:53,541
Narayan Kamble has been previously booked
under Dramatic Performances Act, 1857,

1183
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:57,833
and has been warned to not perform,
write, teach, or publish any material

1184
01:37:57,958 --> 01:37:59,833
that is seditious in nature.

1185
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:03,041
According to UAPA Amendment Act, 2008,

1186
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:06,875
a person can be charged if he does
any act with the intent to threaten,

1187
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,333
or likely to threaten,

1188
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:11,416
the unity, integrity,
security, or sovereignty of India,

1189
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:14,375
or with the intent to strike terror,
or likely to strike terror,

1190
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:17,250
in the people or any section
of the people in India,

1191
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:20,333
or in any foreign country,
by using bombs, dynamite, or other explosive substances,
or inflammable substances,

1192
01:38:23,541 --> 01:38:26,125
or firearms, or other lethal weapons,
or poisons,

1193
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:30,583
or noxious gases, or other chemicals,
or by any other substances,

1194
01:38:30,708 --> 01:38:35,375
whether biological, radioactive, nuclear,
or otherwise, of a hazardous nature,

1195
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:39,666
or by any other means of whatever
nature, or likely to cause:

1196
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:43,625
a) death of, or injuries to,
any person or persons

1197
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:47,500
or b) loss of, or damage to,
or destruction of, property

1198
01:38:47,625 --> 01:38:50,333
or c) disruption of supplies or services

1199
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:52,750
essential to the life
of the community in India

1200
01:38:52,875 --> 01:38:54,708
or in any foreign country.

1201
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:59,708
Sir, where is the bomb?
Where are the lethal weapons?

1202
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:01,916
No, no... bomb, or chemical,

1203
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:06,041
or by any other means
of whatever nature, includes anything.

1204
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:07,958
That is not the point.

1205
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:09,458
What is the intent?

1206
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:12,208
The intent is to threaten,
or likely to threaten,

1207
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:15,875
the unity, integrity, security,
or sovereignty of India.

1208
01:39:16,916 --> 01:39:17,916
Your honour,

1209
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:19,333
my client claims

1210
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:22,166
that the charges against him
are completely fabricated,

1211
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:24,833
including the evidence
submitted by the police.

1212
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:28,583
Now it is a very serious
and convenient accusation.

1213
01:39:29,208 --> 01:39:31,375
The inspector
has authorised permission for arrest

1214
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,166
from his department chief.

1215
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:35,500
Sir, but there is not enough evidence.

1216
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:38,375
I’ve already submitted
my client’s medical reports.

1217
01:39:38,875 --> 01:39:40,625
There is a severe risk to his health

1218
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:43,208
if he’s in prison
for such a long duration.

1219
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:45,041
I request you to grant him bail.

1220
01:39:45,791 --> 01:39:47,625
The police has charged UAPA.

1221
01:39:47,916 --> 01:39:51,166
How can I grant him bail
when there is no bail provision only?

1222
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:54,875
Sir, today is the last working day
in court.

1223
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:58,500
It will be a violation
of my client’s fundamental rights

1224
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:01,125
if he will be placed in judicial custody
for an entire month,

1225
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:02,666
without being proven guilty.

1226
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:07,500
No, no, the summer vacation from tomorrow
is for Sessions Court only.

1227
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:09,125
You can still go to the High Court.

1228
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:27,125
Accused to be remanded...

1229
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:31,250
in judicial custody...

1230
01:40:33,916 --> 01:40:35,208
and...

1231
01:40:36,583 --> 01:40:38,500
to be produced in court...

1232
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:41,541
on Seventh July.

1233
01:40:52,166 --> 01:40:54,041
-Is that all?
-Yes.

1234
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,833
Court is adjourned for the day.

1235
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:33,375
Is everyone here?

1236
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,791
Everyone’s luggage is in place?

1237
01:43:35,916 --> 01:43:40,083
-Come ahead.
-I don’t think they heard you.

1238
01:43:42,958 --> 01:43:46,458
Come, we’re almost ready to leave.

1239
01:43:52,708 --> 01:43:56,125
-Everyone ready?
-Yes.

1240
01:43:57,416 --> 01:44:00,416
All hail Lord Ganesha!

1241
01:44:00,541 --> 01:44:04,916
All hail Lord Ganesha!

1242
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:02,708
Abhijeet had come home,

1243
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:06,208
he told me you’ve started
your own consultancy firm...

1244
01:46:06,333 --> 01:46:08,625
Yes. Got my business cards printed.

1245
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:09,958
For the time being,

1246
01:46:10,083 --> 01:46:14,666
will juggle between my job
and the consultancy.

1247
01:46:15,083 --> 01:46:16,416
Let’s see what happens.

1248
01:46:16,541 --> 01:46:18,166
That means you're not quitting your job?

1249
01:46:18,291 --> 01:46:20,000
-No
-Very good.

1250
01:46:28,291 --> 01:46:30,625
What are the doctors saying about him?

1251
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,125
Nothing clear yet.

1252
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:36,916
We have recently found a new therapist,
let’s wait and watch.

1253
01:46:37,416 --> 01:46:39,333
Is he still not speaking at all?

1254
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:42,833
No, he does say words
like 'ma', pa', etc...

1255
01:46:42,958 --> 01:46:44,583
But not complete sentences.

1256
01:46:44,708 --> 01:46:46,583
Let’s see what this new therapist does.

1257
01:46:47,333 --> 01:46:48,750
What about school?

1258
01:46:48,875 --> 01:46:51,333
No school for now.

1259
01:46:51,458 --> 01:46:55,250
He can’t sit in one place for too long.

1260
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:57,791
He’s very restless.

1261
01:46:58,208 --> 01:47:02,500
These speech therapists
and all are fine...

1262
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:06,833
But I’ve said this before
and I’m saying it again...

1263
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:11,583
You must change his name.
There is a problem with his name.

1264
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:15,541
Show him to a good numerologist

1265
01:47:15,666 --> 01:47:18,500
and get an opinion.

1266
01:47:18,625 --> 01:47:19,708
-Understood?
-Yes.

1267
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:23,750
And I will give you one more tip...
There is a gemstone called Hessonite.

1268
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:24,750
Yes.

1269
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:28,458
Make him wear a Hessonite ring
on his middle finger.

1270
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,166
Tell me
if he doesn't start talking soon...

1271
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:32,375
Okay.

1272
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:35,291
-Just try this.
-We’ll try this as well.

1273
01:47:35,666 --> 01:47:39,083
You need to take advantage
of these phenomena.

1274
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:40,458
Forty-two.

1275
01:47:40,583 --> 01:47:44,666
Anybody got 42?

1276
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:47,791
Anyone hit the middle or bottom line?
Bingo!

1277
01:47:48,291 --> 01:47:50,375
Has anyone got it?
Are you guys paying attention?

1278
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:54,750
Forty-four.

1279
01:48:27,958 --> 01:48:32,125
What's happening is,

1280
01:48:33,375 --> 01:48:37,250
this growth in salary is seen
only in a few sectors.

1281
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,916
For example, the IT industry.

1282
01:48:41,666 --> 01:48:42,750
-Right?
-Yes.

1283
01:48:44,833 --> 01:48:47,208
-There is also MBA.
-Yes, that’s the same.

1284
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:52,083
If you have a degree from IIM Ahmedabad
or IIM Bangalore...

1285
01:48:53,083 --> 01:48:55,750
The minute you pass out,

1286
01:48:55,875 --> 01:48:59,083
you get a salary of 400,000 rupees.

1287
01:48:59,208 --> 01:49:01,291
-Per year?
-Per month!

1288
01:49:02,208 --> 01:49:06,625
Yes. 400,000 per month, in-hand.

1289
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,708
That's ten million a year.

1290
01:49:10,708 --> 01:49:13,750
Just day before,
I read an article in Times of India...

1291
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
The students who topped...

1292
01:49:17,666 --> 01:49:21,833
They got a package of 800,000 rupees.
800,000!

1293
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:40,291
What is going on! Get lost! Go!
