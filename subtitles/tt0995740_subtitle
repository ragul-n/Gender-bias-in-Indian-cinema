00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


3
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:44,916
Baba! 

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,333
Where are you? 

5
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,583
Here.. 

6
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,083
Curfew! - What? 

7
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,541
No idea 

8
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,208
I'm on TV! - On TV.. 

9
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,958
On what channel? 

10
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,625
I don't know, some strange language written here.. 

11
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,041
.. like on a bottle of Vodka.. 

12
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,416
Vodka? 

13
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,250
My throat's parched.. 

14
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,916
.. cigarette.. cigarette.. 

15
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,833
.. you still smoking! 

16
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,083
I need a cigarette! - I'll call you later.. 

17
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,083
K! 

18
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,291
What the hell is this place? 

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,083
Cigarette!!! 

20
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,416
Cigarette!!! 

21
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,208
Bloody gibberish spouting bastard!! 

22
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,791
Opened. 

23
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,625
Bastard.. 

24
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,125
Matches.. 

25
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,416
K.. 

26
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,875
Open the door K.. 

27
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,666
open up! 

28
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,333
K.. 

29
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,500
Ya.. - K.. open the door.. 

30
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,416
Ya.. 

31
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,041
K? - You alright? 

32
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,541
At least say something? 

33
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,833
Ya! Hold on! 

34
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,083
Bastard. 

35
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,708
Witch. 

36
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,583
Come out fast. We are expecting guests anytime. 

37
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,375
My dream.. What does it mean? 

38
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,458
You're soooo!! addicted to nicotine! 

39
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,416
You fear the day when you won't get a Cigarette! 

40
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,333
But what's that bathtub doing in the middle of the snow! 

41
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,500
I don't Know? 

42
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,750
Next time try jumping in the bathtub, instead! 

43
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,416
It might lead you somewhere else? 

44
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,500
The mirror will fall apart K.. 

45
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,125
Why the hell do you smoke in the Bathroom!! 

46
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,625
Why the hell do you sleep in the bedroom!! 

47
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,125
What's wrong now? 

48
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,625
Nothing.. 

49
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,291
Went to Siberia again? 

50
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,166
It's all because of those cigarettes.. 

51
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,708
You will soon have the visa too.. 

52
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,500
Please.. don't blow smoke in here.. 

53
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,041
Why don't you go get dressed, 

54
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,625
The guests should be here soon.. 

55
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,083
Nobody tells me what to do, 

56
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,958
Nobody tells me what to do, 

57
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,666
Nobody tells me.. 

58
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,125
.. what to do.. 

59
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,083
When some nut decides to clamber up mount everest.. 

60
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,708
.. the world stands up to cheer him.. 

61
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,958
What if he's doing it for the first time.. 

62
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,583
.. his rope could snap.. 

63
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,833
He could get buried under a mound of snow.. 

64
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,250
The world knows he.. he could bloody die.. 

65
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,958
.. but they still put him on the front page.. 

66
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,416
Hundreds die in accidents every day.. 

67
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,083
.. but we're still driving!! 

68
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,000
Automobiles should be outlawed.. 

69
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,375
.. petrol should be banned.. 

70
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,541
.. why ban cigarettes alone.. 

71
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,375
.. because this tiny little innocuous white thing.. 

72
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,083
.. can't speak for itself.. 

73
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,333
Have you ever seen him smoke? 

74
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,416
In the kitchen.. - The bathroom.. 

75
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,208
The bedroom.. - In the bloody bed.. 

76
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,458
There are more ashtrays in this house than spoons.. 

77
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,291
That's it.. - That's not it? 

78
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,791
Even Vikas used to smoke.. 

79
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,250
I made him quit.. 

80
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,625
.. there's this Shaman doctor baba Bengali.. 

81
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,208
But that isn't the only reason.. - So what else? 

82
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,458
Religious differences.. 

83
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,958
He thinks he's God. 

84
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,208
I think he's.. 

85
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,750
Bad! Huh! - Really Bad! 

86
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,208
My brother.. He's Asthmatic! 

87
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,541
Not me! 

88
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,250
I heard he's in a hospital.. 

89
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,416
They've removed his right lung.. 

90
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,083
.. it was infected.. 

91
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,541
And K still smokes around everyone.. 

92
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,458
Search me.. 

93
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,208
My parents divorced six months into their marriage.. 

94
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,291
You're kidding me.. 

95
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,750
And then I arrived.. 

96
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,208
.. so they remarried.. 

97
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,625
two years into their second marriage.. 

98
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,291
.. my dad found out that I was born a year.. 

99
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,500
.. after the divorce.. 

100
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,083
.. so they divorced again.. 

101
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,166
That sucks, dude! 

102
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,375
So when was your brother born? 

103
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,708
In the second coming or.. 

104
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,208
After the second divorce.. 

105
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,916
So he's not exactly your blood brother? 

106
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,291
He is.. 

107
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,666
How.. - See.. 

108
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,125
They married.. 

109
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,333
Then divorced.. 

110
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,541
Then they had you.. 

111
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,916
Married again.. 

112
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,333
Divorced again.. 

113
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,041
Then they had him.. 

114
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,625
.. which means he can't be your real brother.. 

115
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,500
Have you told him you want to leave him.. 

116
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,666
Not yet.. 

117
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,958
Does he know you want to leave him? 

118
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,583
If he was that sensitive.. Why would I leave him? 

119
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,125
Hi.. 

120
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,541
Hi.. - Lets go.. 

121
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,583
Want to smoke, go outside 

122
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,041
Its totally wrong. 

123
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,125
Actually they should bloody close down all the non smoking restaurants. 

124
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,208
My self R. K. Dhingra, 

125
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,000
Rajinder Kumar Dhingra. 

126
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,166
You don't talk too much, 

127
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,041
You seem to be the thinking type. 

128
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,875
Even I think a lot.. 

129
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:19,458
Before you came that's what I was doing, thinking.. 

130
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,666
Wondering, why do people need to talk so much? 

131
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,375
- K.. - Abbas! 

132
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,666
Hi! What are you doing standing out here? 

133
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,250
Smoking! Brother! 

134
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,708
Want one? 

135
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,000
No way - No I won't.. 

136
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,541
Cut the crap man here.. 

137
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,333
No! No! K! I swear I quit. 

138
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,583
Trust me, so should you. 

139
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,375
Don't be my wife, God knows where you disappear! 

140
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,208
Been ages since I saw you.. - Come on, lets share one! 

141
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,416
No! K! I'm not gonna smoke! 

142
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,625
- Come On!! Just a puff!- No! K! No! 

143
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,166
- I Don't.. K! - What's wrong. 

144
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,833
Take a drag my friend.. Nothing's gonna blow except the smoke.. 

145
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,750
Look sir! Why don't you mind your own business! 

146
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,375
Your friend is offering you a drag.. 

147
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,041
You shouldn't refuse him.. 

148
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,208
Is he your friend? Who is this guy? 

149
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,791
Friendships don't blossom in a single meeting. 

150
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,250
My friend.. takes time.. 

151
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,458
Just shut up. 

152
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,958
Sir, it takes ages! 

153
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,458
Shut up. Why don't you go somewhere else? 

154
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,666
Please! 

155
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,916
Idiot man! - Abbas! 

156
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,958
Hi! - Oh! Hi Anjali. 

157
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,916
How are you? - Hi! 

158
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,416
How are you? - I'm good 

159
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
Why are you wearing those gloves.. 

160
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,625
Oh, just like that. 

161
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,583
I lost my fingers in an accident. 

162
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,875
What! 

163
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,083
What nonsense are you talking! 

164
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,291
Why didn't you tell me? 

165
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,500
It's nothing much! Really 

166
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,708
Oh my God! 

167
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,375
And what's that you've got in your ears? 

168
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,666
Just.. 

169
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,958
I've a bit of a hearing problem. 

170
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,708
You quit smoking? 

171
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,250
Yeah, I have quit. 

172
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,541
Very good. 

173
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,083
What very good! 

174
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,250
He's gonna smoke right now! Here.. 

175
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,666
K stop it! 

176
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,875
K! 

177
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,958
C'mon, all I'm asking you for is a drag man! One drag! For my sake! 

178
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,250
Or she'll hound me to death with it.. 

179
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,625
K! I have said NO! That's it! I won't smoke. 

180
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,125
K!! - K! I won't smoke! 

181
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,125
K! - Don't force him!!- Stop it!! 

182
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,791
Go inside! 

183
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,708
I said GO in!! 

184
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,125

If I say you will! You will! - K! I won't! That's it! 

188
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,208
I love my wife! Ok!

00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,125
What loves your wife got to do with smoking? 

190
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,333
Sir, if I was in his place I wouldn't push you away like that. 

191
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,333
You do what you're doing! 

192
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,833
And keep your mouth shut! You Asshole!

What'll you do, huh 

194
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,541
You're mistaken. I'm not that kind of a guy. 

195
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,750
You're a big asshole kind of a guy.. 

196
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,416
Sir.. You.. You.. 

197
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,958

Shut up! 

201
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,708
I know K can be an asshole sometimes 

202
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,333
Most of the times 

203
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,666
Yeah 

204
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,750
Why do you want to know Anjali? 

205
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,125
Abbas tell me! 

206
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,791
K's not gonna quit! 

207
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,666
Okay.. If you really want Him to quit smoking then. 

208
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,750
Take this.. 

209
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,875
The Laboratory. Their visiting card! - It's a Rehabilitation program. 

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,625
Okay - They are professionals! 

211
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,291
You don't feel the urge at all? 

212
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,375
No. Never. 

213
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,708
Thanks. 

214
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,666
Anjali, I'm actually meeting someone. 

215
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,750
I'll go now. - Yeah. Thanks. 

216
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,958
Bye. Thanks. 

217
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,000
Why don't you quit smoking? 

218
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,541
I have quit a hundred times.. 

219
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,000
That's not what you call quitting.. 

220
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,458
Then what do you call quitting? 

221
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,875
Like my dad and mum quitting on each other? 

222
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,833
I don't quit! Quitters are those who can't see it through to the end! 

223
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,125
What if you start hating it? 

224
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,000
"Shut up, just shut up.." 

225
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:04,041
"Shut up, just shut up.." 

226
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,416
Anjali.. 

227
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,833
Yes.. 

228
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,250
You're asleep? 

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,083
Yes.. 

230
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,166
Are you still upset.. 

231
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,708

232
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,541

233
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,750

234
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,208

235
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,708
Come on.. 

236
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,916
K! - Sorry 

237
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,500
Can I sleep now.. 

238
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:52,208
Okay. Sleep. 

239
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,375
Hi.. 

240
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,083
I'm K.. 

241
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,250
Just K.. 

242
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,958
What's this? 

243
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,625
They're taking them to the concentration camp and killing them.. 

244
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,041
This card.. 

245
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,875
It says Kalkatta carpets.. 

246
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,125
I got that from Abbas.. 

247
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,041
.. but you won't need it.. 

248
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,208
Is it his business card? 

249
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,791
Selling carpets these days.. ? 

250
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,041
It's a Rehabilitation program. 

251
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,208
People don't have any other better work to do. 

252
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,958
They helped Abbas kick the habit.. 

253
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,041
He taught you to smoke right? 

254
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,250
No one taught me to smoke. 

255
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,333
No one taught me anything. 

256
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,958
I smoke. 

257
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,500
And that's it. The first time, Abbas gave me a cigarette, 

258
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,583
I took the matches out from my own pocket.. 

259
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,083
Watch your TV 

260
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,333
Anjali.. 

261
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,791

268
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,166

269
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,583
"Like a big piece of fire.. " 

270
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,208
"When the world.. " 

271
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,541
I am not being childish. 

272
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,625
Its not my fault if I look like a girl, 

273
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,833
I am 28 for god sake.. 

274
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,166

Some breathing exercises 

285
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,125
You smoke too much.. 

286
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,083

Why do you always wear those hearing aids? 

292

That's your home K..

354
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,375
You're leaving me.. 

355
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,583
I've left you.. 

356
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,791
How can you leave me.. 

357
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,041
Nobody leaves me

00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:15,041
Don't you crave for it whenever someone lights up? 

362
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,958
No K! just check it out for once man! 

363
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,625
Even I'd gone to just see the place! 

364
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,083
Came out kicking the habit 

365
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,500
Do I have to take an appointment? 

366
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,208
Tell me.. I'll take an appointment for you.. 

367
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,708
When do you want to go? 

368
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,916
Right now. 

369
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,125
Right now? 

370
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,333
To treat. 

371
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:29,916
Great! You know the place.. 

372
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,125
I have the card 

373
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,041
K! 

374
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,916
You're doing the right thing ok.. 

375
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll inform them right away, Bye. 

376
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,333
Hello. Welcome to The Laboratory. How can I help you? 

377
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,166
Listen this is Abbas Tyrewala speaking.. 

378
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,541
I want to send you another patient 

379
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:53,875
Abbas what? 

380
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,500
Tyrewala - Yes sir.. 

381
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,250
His name is.. 

382
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,958
.. but before that, what about my finger? 

383
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,166
Well.. I guess you haven't read your contract properly.. 

384
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:06,625
.. as soon as your referred patient signs his contract.. 

385
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,541
.. you'll get your cut-back 

386
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,041
No.. No.. No.. its ok 

387
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,416
Write down your tracking number 

388
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,791
Please hold for a minute.. 

389
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,000
Hey waiter! Come here!..

00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:28,750
He's going! 

392
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,500
Hello! 

393
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:33,875
I'm going to quit.. 

394
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,583
I swear.. 

395
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,250
Please come back.. 

396
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,875
Come back. 

397
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,291
I'm trying really hard.. 

398
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:44,125
Hmm.. - What Hmmmm.. 

399
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:45,958
Hmmmm okay..

00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,666
You're coming? - Are you going? 

401
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,875
I'm going 

402
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,125
Then I'm coming 

403
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,333
Thanks.. 

404
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,000
No change 

405
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,375
Don't worry. I've change 

406
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,875
So - Keep it. You are going to need it.. 

407
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,708
Where is the laboratory? 

408
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,125
There. 

409
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,125
Hey uncle 

410
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,958
You sell oil? Carpets? 

411
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,166
Where's The Laboratory? 

412
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,916
Wonderful. 

413
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:43,750
What? 

414
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,041
What you are looking for. 

415
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,958
Down there? 

416
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,000
If you don't want to go, I'll shut it. 

417
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,291
One second. 

418
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,333
Where's this Laboratory? 

419
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,541
Below.. 

420
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,416
Ma'am! Where's the Laboratory? 

421
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,625
Down there.. 

422
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,958
Thank you. 

423
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:48,708
Where's the Laboratory? 

424
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,916
Down There 

425
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,041
Is there another level below it or does it ends here? 

426
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,541
Go down further.. 

427
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,041
Why couldn't they get the bloody elevators.. 

428
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,291
Hey. 

429
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:21,791
This way or that way.. 

430
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,000
That way. 

431
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,916
Where's this Laboratory? 

432
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,291
Welcome 

433
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:45,791
No! - The Laboratory? 

434
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,750
Mr. Abbas must have sent you! 

435
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,416
Mind blowing! 

436
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,541
Follow me 

437
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,166
Come 

438
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:36,875
Who were those people? 

439
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,416
Hello! I'm asking you? 

440
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,000
Greetings 

441
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,833
Guruji sits there. 

442
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,791
Guruji might be sitting there but who were those people staring at me? 

443
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,208
Nothing is made on one level here? 

444
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,416
Greetings! 

445
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,500
Please come. 

446
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,833
Have a Seat.. 

447
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,458
What's going on inside? 

448
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,000
Sit 

449
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,125
Who's this Guruji? 

450
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,250
Shri! Shri! Shri! 

451
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,000
Greater than the Great.. Baba Bengali! 

452
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,208
From Sialdah! 

453
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:41,041
He is coming!! - You please wait!! 

454
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,875
Prologue please.. 

455
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,958
I.. my name is K.. 

456
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,791
And you feel the need to relinquish the cigarette.. 

457
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,000
Yes.. 

458
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,375
Consider it done.. 

459
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,666
Actually just came to check it out.. 

460
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:19,416
Whoever steps in here not only stubs his addiction 

461
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,666
.. but completely buries it my son.. 

462
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:25,041
.. cigarettes, bidis, paan, tobacco.. 

463
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,416
Baba Bengali can cure you of them all. 

464
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,291
How do you make them quit 

465
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,916
Point a gun to the head! 

466
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,041
Bandits and Kidnappers need weapons, 

467
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,416
I don't. 

468
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,041
Chaurasiya! - Yes, sir? 

469
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,541
Didn't you show the noble man our contract.. 

470
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,291
Not yet.. 

471
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:00,791
Standing here won't make you any taller! 

472
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,458
Please! Show him the contract. 

473
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,750
Yes, sir. 

474
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,041
Do I have to read all this? 

475
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,250
Yes! 

476
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,833
If Hindi is going to be a problem. 

477
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,291
We have the same in English too. 

478
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:23,291
Guide for dummies! 

479
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,208
It's rather thick! 

480
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,208
If you feel the compulsion to read an abridged version 

481
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,375
.. we have that too! Our very own.. 

482
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,166
Pocket Edition 

483
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,000
Please show him.. - Okay. 

484
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,083
Please read.. 

485
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,458
I hereby agree to do whatever 

486
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:57,708
I am asked to do in order to successfully quit smoking.. 

487
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,791
I am getting into this program knowingly exactly the risk my smoking 

488
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,041
.. will pose to me and my family. Thanks. 

489
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,333
K! 

490
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:08,416
Meaning you'll do exactly as we tell you to do. 

491
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:10,416
But what will you tell me to do? 

492
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,708
First you'll have to sign. Then I'll let you know! 

493
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,500
What if I sign these papers.. 

494
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,708
.. and you put a gun on me.. then. 

495
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:21,291
Sir!! Kindly sign it. 

496
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,416
Why do you want to invite trouble? 

497
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:25,541
And what if I don't? 

498
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:40,583
Hey! What's happening? 

499
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,458
Leave me! 

500
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,208
Leave me! 

501
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,625
What are you doing! 

502
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,958
Leave! 

503
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,166
Leave me! 

504
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,708
Where are you taking me? 

505
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,208
Leave me! 

506
00:38:58,708 --> 00:38:59,916
Let me go. 

507
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,125
Let me go.. 

508
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,958
Hey fatso.. I am talking to you.. 

509
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,458
Leave me! 

510
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,083
What're you doing? 

511
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:09,791
Let me go.. 

512
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,708
You don't know who I am.. 

513
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,083
Leave me! 

514
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,958
Hey! Let me go.. 

515
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:35,625
Welcome to the first stage of 

516
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:41,708
.. our Quit Smoking Programme.. 

517
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,291
K 

518
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:46,625
Wake up.. 

519
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,875
Wake up my son.. 

520
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,958
In this lab.. 

521
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,166
.. its our responsibility.. 

522
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:11,750
.. that your habit of smoking, which is making you irresponsible.. 

523
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,458
.. finish that off completely. 

524
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:20,041
If we fail to deliver.. 

525
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,291
.. and are unsuccessful in treating you, 

526
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,458
.. then we have no option left, 

527
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,541
.. but to send you down the road no sane person would walk on.. 

528
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,000
Would anybody like? 

529
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,166
No.. 

530
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:36,125
Because my son, soul-full the body is divine.. soul-less its dead 

531
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,416
The end.. 

532
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,666
Soul.. 

533
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,041
The inner soul.. 

534
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:45,708
.. is often frivolous, debauch, indulgent.. 

535
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:50,833
but with a strong mind you can control it.. 

536
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:53,958
.. but if you are inherently weak then my son.. 

537
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:59,500
.. the wandering soul has to be released, let go.. 

538
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,416
The soul is pure, 

539
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,916
When life comes into being.. 

540
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:10,625
.. then slowly, bit by bit it starts to erode.. 

541
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,708
.. the body corrupts it, by indulging it.. 

542
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:17,458
..and to rebuild that lost eroded soul is why I have been appointed.. 

543
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,166
By whom? 

544
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,875
By The Greater than the Greatest! 

545
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,666
Gurudev Baba Bengali! 

546
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,500
But! 

547
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,958
Don't Argue!! 

548
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,333
Democracy is up above the ground you walk on! You die on! 

549
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:37,833
You can "butt" into anything with your but's, up there.. 

550
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:40,125
But here you have descended from your material hell.. 

551
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,250
..into my lower depths.. 

552
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,250
Here my spoken word is the gospel of the gods.. 

553
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,625
Now that you've signed on the contract.. 

554
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,125
.. would you care to repeat the honours.. 

555
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,791
This is my cheque book! 

556
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,000
Yes sir. 

557
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,375
21 lakhs 11 thousand 1 hundred and 10! 

558
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:19,875
Fees for your own treatment! 

559
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,041
2.1 million. 

560
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,000
21 lakhs 11 thousand 1 hundred and 10 

561
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,333
And an additional one rupee.. 

562
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:26,541
which is my fee 

563
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,666
But that we take in cash 

564
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,958
The fees for making me quit smoking is 21 LAKH! 

565
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:34,125
21 lakhs 11 thousand 1 hundred and 10 

566
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,375
It's back-breaking work, you know. 

567
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:39,916
You think I'm crazy? 

568
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,333
You think I earn my money only to dole it out as charity 

569
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,541
21 Lakh! 

570
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:45,416
Repeating it again & again won't make it 20.. 

571
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,208
.. it will stay 21 only.. 

572
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:48,541
If a poor man comes to you for help.. 

573
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,166
.. you charge him 21 lakhs too? 

574
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,875
The "Poor" qualifies for a government subsidy 

575
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,500
This is robbery, you understand! 

576
00:42:56,916 --> 00:43:00,583
See, my fee is just a measly buck 

577
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,250
That too a token of your appreciation 

578
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,833
I haven't started this business for money. 

579
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,041
Its all for charity 

580
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,333
And just you watch! 

581
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:13,083
The money you've parted with will be utilized in your own treatment 

582
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,625
Do you know that how much of your money.. 

583
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,625
.. you've squandered away due to this bloody habit.. 

584
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,125
Yes.. my lord.. 

585
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:31,958
K.. 

586
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:35,791
K! 

587
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,000
K! 

588
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,125
Here it is. K. 

589
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:51,833
Touch of violence please! 

590
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,000
Ok my lord.. 

591
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,500
The first time 

592
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,958
Abbas stuck a cigarette between 

593
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,625
.. your fingers just so you could look at it 

594
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,708
you procured the matches from your own pocket.. 

595
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,541
.. a matchbox back then set you back by 50 paise.. 

596
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,916
.. all the gas you burnt up commuting to and from the cigarette shop.. 

597
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,000
.. the mouth freshener that you purchased 

598
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,875
.. to hide the stench from your father.. 

599
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,125
.. then you graduated to pot.. 

600
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,250
.. and once after smoking some spurious weed 

601
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,333
.. you nearly went up in smoke yourself! 

602
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:20,833
A mere visit to the hospital cost you 

603
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:24,291
.. 1,50,000 to aspirate the sludge from your stomach.. 

604
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,666
.. every ashtray.. matchbox, lighter, bidi.. 

605
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,875
.. and those fat ones 

606
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,791
Cigars. Every wheeze, sputter and cough caused by smoking.. 

607
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:31,250
.. every spoonful of glycodine, phensydyl 

608
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,250
.. every pill strepsil, Erithromycin, Augmentin.. 

609
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:37,041
.. every illness brought on by this habit of yours.. 

610
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:40,083
.. all those occasions when.. 

611
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:42,291
.. your partner requested you to butt your cigarette out.. 

612
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:45,416
.. but you suspended the meeting and strode out to finish your smoke.. 

613
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
.. the losses you incurred because of that! 

614
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:48,708
Your wife's illness. 

615
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,000
You bear a thirty percent stake in your brother's asthma trouble.. 

616
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,666
.. a silk Chinese tie estimated at forty thousand burnt.. 

617
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:53,750
.. mattresses set afire on four disparate occasions.. 

618
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,166
.. all because of a lit cigarette 

619
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:59,666
Now excluding the millions in losses.. 

620
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:03,458
.. you have spent a total of 

621
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,833
43 lakhs 88 thousand 

622
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:10,333
5 hundered 56 rupees and 75 paise 

623
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,583
If you don't step on the brakes now you'll be spending 

624
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,625
.. as much more in the next seven years 

625
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,416
To help you shake off the yoke of this burden.. 

626
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,458
.. the treatment is in your hands 

627
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,083
Give him a pen 

628
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,333
Yes sir 

629
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:33,875
43 lakh or 21 lakh. 

630
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,500
And what if I don't sign it? 

631
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,791
If you don't do it now then you have to do it later 

632
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,625
What if I don't do it? 

633
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:51,000
Answer to your what is a complicated process 

634
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,083
.. my son.. you can't expect me to be prompt. 

635
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:00,750
I am going 

636
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:01,958
Guruji.. 

637
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,333
But you have signed a contract 

638
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,250
I haven't! You forced me to! 

639
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:08,833
Do you know who I am? 

640
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:12,708
Why K? Where K? That I don't know. 

641
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:16,791
But who K! That I surely do know! 

642
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,541
I am going. 

643
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:24,833
Your wish, I treat patient's and not torment them. 

644
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,666
What's the way out from here? 

645
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,541
That's why I keep repeating son, 

646
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,375
Sign on it and.. 

647
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,333
All the doors will open up for you. 

648
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:41,125
Otherwise I will be forced to do what I don't want to do. 

649
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:45,208
The only problem with such a quick second trip to that black hole is.. 

650
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:47,125
.. you may not last the third. 

651
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,541
That's why just sign for now 

652
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:54,541
You can stop payment later 

653
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,625
Did you sign? 

654
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:47,166
Give him a pen, please! 

655
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:03,541
Now my one rupee please which I take in cash?.. 

656
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:05,250
Don't have it 

657
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,625
Ok. 

658
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,916
Next time. 

659
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:09,916
Does it look like I'm coming back? 

660
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:11,750
It's good if you don't come! 

661
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,750
But son, everyone comes back. 

662
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,333
In my experience each one returns.. 

663
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,125
Unfortunately smoking is such a pathetic habit.. 

664
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:24,041
Now come over here.. 

665
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:26,000
You come here! 

666
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,083
Come on son. 

667
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:31,458
Your treatment has begun. Come 

668
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,083
And if I don't? 

669
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,916
If you don't come? 

670
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:36,875
Then how will you go? 

671
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,833
From this moment onwards you will not smoke.. 

672
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,458
Not even going to touch it.. 

673
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:52,666
And if you do 

674
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:56,041
then for the first one that you light.. 

675
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,000
.. we'll have your brother.. 

676
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,666
.. pay us a little visit from his hospital bed.. 

677
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:01,375
.. do you know what this is ? 

678
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:05,083
Once upon a time lived a man called Hitler.. 

679
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:08,625
He had a teeny weenie moustache like that Charlie of Chaplin.. 

680
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,083
See that. 

681
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,333
My good friend, 

682
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,791
Hitler 

683
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:15,541
This was his stroke of genius 

684
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,375
the Gas Chamber 

685
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:21,333
And the lady there, she is your doctor's mother.. 

686
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,125
.. and the smoke.. 

687
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,833
.. its the cigarette smoke.. 

688
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:30,375
..all the thousands of cigarettes.. 

689
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:33,958
..you must have smoked up until now all that smoke in this.. 

690
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:37,541
..little room for your brother to breathe in for all of five minutes. 

691
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,916
Enough to make the healthiest of lungs burst.. 

692
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,250
.. and I believe your brother is just one lung-ed. 

693
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:52,958
And if your resolve still doesn't hold up and you light up again! 

694
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:57,916
Please sir, just listen to me, I swear 

695
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:00,416
I swear to god almighty I'll never 

696
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,833
He scripts with just one finger now 

697
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:14,291
Salam Namaste, M.B.B.S. 

698
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:18,666
Listen Maqbool, I am there for you. 

699
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:21,333
And if you light a third one.. 

700
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:22,916
.. son before you smoke it make sure.. 

701
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:27,125
.. you take one last long loving look at your wife.. 

702
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:31,625
.. because in all likelihood you'll never see her again.. 

703
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:37,250
.. and if your itch drives you to light up a fourth time then.. 

704
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:40,375
.. it's the gas chamber for your brother.. 

705
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,166
.. if he survives the last onslaught.. 

706
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,500
.. and if he doesn't then your mother.. 

707
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:51,208
remember to give her a warm farewell hug before you light that one.. 

708
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,125
.. and despite all of the above if.. 

709
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,416
.. you still intend to be as obstinate as a mule. 

710
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,333
Then the mightiest of kings have been rendered helpless.. 

711
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:00,458
.. before the stubbornness of a child. 

712
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:04,291
Smoke the fifth with all the lungpower you've got. 

713
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,833
No one will get in the way 

714
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,958
No! Nope! 

715
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,791
Nobody will stop you 

716
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,375
Because son Soul-Full, the body is divine.. Soul- Less, its dead. 

717
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,083
You can go to the police station 

718
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,458
You can try to fight us. 

719
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,500
You can do whatever you want to.. 

720
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:31,000
.. but you can't smoke. Have fun.. 

721
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,208
Time to go 

722
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:36,000
Let's go 

723
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:43,875
You're absolutely insane. 

724
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,541
I didn't come here to sign any contract 

725
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:50,416
I don't want to quit smoking 

726
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,791
What will you do? 

727
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:53,708

If you don't want to come along, can I leave? 

739
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:11,833
Why are you wearing a veil? 

740

Why didn't you tell me? 

753
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:45,208
How will they know if I smoke 

754
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:46,666

How the hell will they know? 

757

How can one watch you 24 hours a day.. 

758
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,875
If you don't want to watch your family die before you do, one by one. 

759
00:55:57,958 --> 00:55:59,125
Don't touch the damn thing. 

760
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,041

761
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:03,083
I won't just touch it I'll frigging suck on one. 

762
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,750

909
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,666
I knew my son could do no wrong. 

910
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,125
And my son's friend too! 

911
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:43,541
Come 

912
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,458
Those were the days, man! 

913
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,750
Great times! 

914
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:52,166
No one to stop you! 

915
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,833
I'm starting to feel sorry for you.. 

916
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:57,625
What? 

917
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:03,458
Just look at yourself.. 

918
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:06,125
The Abbas then and the Abbas now.. 

919
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,500
You are like a flat tyre. 

920
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:14,041
You've changed post marriage.. 

921
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:17,916
"Stranger.. " 

922
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:25,041
"Stranger.. " 

923
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,583
I'm going to smoke.. 

924
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:28,916
What? 

925
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:30,333
Come what may.. 

926
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:33,000
K, have you lost it? 

927
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:35,125
Let's see what can he do.. 

928
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:36,583
K!!! 

929
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,000
Just watch me! 

930
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,041
I'm gonna smoke.. 

931
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:45,041
K!! - K!! 

932
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,208
Don't do it K. 

933
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:56,208
Annie! - What are you doing? 

934
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,500
On the net 

935
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:59,000
Was about to sleep.. 

936
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,416
You have my e-banking password, right? 

937
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,041
Yes - Log in 

938
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,375
I had issued a cheque today 

939
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:10,750
Rs.21,11,110 

940
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:12,541
It has cleared 

941
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:13,958
In a day! 

942
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,708
It's showing a withdrawl 

943
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,166
What happened, Sir? 

944
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:18,375
Goodnight. 

945
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,875
Where are you going, Sir? 

946
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,250
I don't have a clue. 

947
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:14,166
Why are you going, Sir? 

948
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:20,375
Do you smoke after sex? 

949
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:21,750
Oh shit.. 

950
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,750
I'm sorry. I never looked. 

951
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,125
Do you smoke? 

952
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:29,916
I sweat! 

953
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,708
Book me on every flight that goes from here to wherever it goes 

954
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:36,375
From every destination to every destination. 

955
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:37,666
Am I clear? 

956
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:42,000
What do I do with the other tickets? 

957
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,625
Throw them! - Okay! 

958
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,875
Thrown them! 

959
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:46,666
Like from here to here. 

960
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:48,541
And if there are any flights from those .. 

961
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:50,041
.. destinations to further destinations book.. 

962
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:51,458
.. me on all of those too.. 

963
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,875
From every destination to every destination 

964
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:57,208
All separate tickets from a destination.. 

965
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:59,041
.. in separate boxes packed separately! 

966
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,958
For example all the tickets from here.. 

967
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,625
.. go in this box labeled as.. 

968
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:15,541
And there should be a man there waiting for me with the box.. 

969
01:10:15,666 --> 01:10:17,041
Am I clear, Annie? 

970
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:18,541
Meaning? 

971
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:20,666
I mean that if I don't have a clue where I'm headed.. 

972
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,958
.. there's no way in hell that descendant of Hitler would?

"Kalkatta Carpets" 

974
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:13,708
I forbade you, didn't I? 

975
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,333
Where is my brother? 

976
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,916
Let him go! 

977
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:22,750
Let him go.. 

978
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:24,916
Look at me.. 

979
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:26,625
Let him go.. 

980
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,916
Or else.. 

981
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:32,250
Hey fatso.. move aside.. 

982
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,333
Hey! 

983
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,208
What are you doing? 

984
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:39,375
Leave my brother.. 

985
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,291
Let him go.. 

986
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,750
I don't want to go in there! 

987
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,916
Please listen to me!

Leave ! - Leave me! - Leave !

Your brother is still breathing..

Let him go 

993
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,583
You've got to pay for that.. 

994
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:23,750

01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:38,625
What is was that? 

1000
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,000
Punishment 

1001
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,083
And what about my Brother? 

1002
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:00,541
Hello! 

1003
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:08,916
Hello 

1004
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,666
K! We've found your brother 

1005
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,625
He is having trouble breathing. 

1006
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,083
We've put him on a ventilator.. 

1007
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,458
How are feeling, J? 

1008
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,333
Go Away ! 

1009
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:34,708
What's happened to him? 

1010
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:38,583
Lets go 

1011
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:41,916
Lets go

And don't ever try doing it again.. 

1013
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,625
I know the little girl.. 

1014
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:59,541
Yeah, It happens! 

1015
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:01,750

Plaster the whole damn place with "No Smoking" signs. 

1021

Get rid of every last ashtray..

And if someone wants to smoke? 

1026

Then he can leave the job.. 

1027
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,833
But why sir? 

1028
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:41,583
Because I can't smoke 

1029

You are trying to humor me.. 

1090
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:45,125
Do I look like I can? 

1091
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,083
You've changed! 

1092
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:52,666
But don't worry! 

1093
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:53,916
Coz I'm back. 

1094
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,583
And do you know why I am back? 

1095
01:21:58,333 --> 01:21:59,875
Sarah, Why am I back? 

1096
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,583
What? 

1097
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:04,500
Sarah, why am I back? - What? 

1098
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:06,375
Whore! Go back to Cuba! 

1099
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:08,750
From Havana. 

1100
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,208
Import from there.. 

1101
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:12,458
Sell it here 

1102
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:14,375
In-fidel. 

1103
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,583
Castrated! 

1104
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,583
In-fidel. 

1105
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:19,916
Castrated!! 

1106
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,416
Back there when I ran away to Sir Castro's beautiful Cuba! 

1107
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:32,208
Once there I booked myself in a room in a three star hotel. 

1108
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,791
"How lucky can one guy be.. " 

1109
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,791
"I kissed her, she kissed me.. " 

1110
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:39,541
First day, I lay down on my bed. 

1111
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:41,041
"Everything all set.. " 

1112
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:43,000
The hotel was a three star.. 

1113
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,541
.. two of which were shining through my roof.. 

1114
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:48,250
I stood up on the bed. 

1115
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,250
And stuck a finger each in both the holes 

1116
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:52,250
My fingers weren't thick enough 

1117
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:53,708
I looked down. 

1118
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,333
Saw two cigars in an ashtray 

1119
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:58,708
I picked them up and shoved them into the holes.. 

1120
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:01,458
Then I got into the cigar business! 

1121
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,916
But soon enough, Smoking was banned! 

1122
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:06,250
What do I do now? I was wondering when.. 

1123
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,291
Sarah said "Let's go to India!" 

1124
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:10,791
But I was lost! 

1125
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,750
What would I do in India? 

1126
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:14,291
I swear 

1127
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:18,125
I had no idea my fate matched Newton's 

1128
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:22,250
The cigar from one of the holes fell on my head 

1129
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:24,666
And I thought.. 

1130
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:29,916
What I used to do in Cuba.. 

1131
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,791
Why not do that in India! 

1132
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:34,958
Now every Indian can have the opportunity to blow on.. 

1133
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,375
.. a In-fidel.. that's castrated.. 

1134
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,916
With the spelling mistake. 

1135
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:45,375
And now ladies and gentleman and friends! 

1136
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,333
There is a man 

1137
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:50,625
The man that made me smell my first cigar. - Let's go! 

1138
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,541
K! Ladies & Gentlemen! 

1139
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:54,208
My dear friend, K! 

1140
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:55,416
Just K! 

1141
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:57,000
K for klinton guys! 

1142
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:59,416
The true blue cigar aficionado! 

1143
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,041
Hey K! - Great! 

1144
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:02,791

1146
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,208
Come K! 

1147
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,583
I'll only unwrap it. 

1148
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:15,125
Not light it 

1149
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,791
I don't smoke anymore. 

1150
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:20,958
Why? - Why! 

1151
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:28,291
Search me.. 

1152
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:30,458
Will only unwrap it. 

1153
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,041
Hey! Come on! Let's have it! 

1154
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:36,166
Ladies and gentlemen.. 

1155
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:38,666
In-fidel castrated! 

1156
01:24:38,791 --> 01:24:40,125
With a correct spelling! 

1157
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,041
Here - Just touch it to your lips! 

1158
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:44,750
No man! 

1159
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,791
Don't light it. Just put it in your mouth. 

1160
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:49,791
I'm telling you.. NO! 

1161
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:52,083
Come on! - K! Come on! 

1162
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,666
Come On! Let's have a smoke!

01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:24,666
Hhaapppy biirrthhhday ttooo yyouu!! 

1169
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:37,791
I didn't do it! 

1170
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,083
Didn't do what? 

1171
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:40,500
I didn't do it! 

1172
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:42,625
Exactly what did you not do? 

1173
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:46,458
Who is speaking? - What did you not do? 

1174
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,041
Who is speaking? 

1175
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,291
ACP Birsa Das Gupta 

1176
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:51,625
From your residence 

1177
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,208
Your wife called us 

1178
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:56,000
When we got here everything was tossed about.. 

1179
01:25:56,041 --> 01:26:01,166
.. the walls are splattered with blood and your wife is missing! 

1180
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:02,833
My wife is with me 

1181
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,041
Anjali is right here. 

1182
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:05,833
Why would she call you over? 

1183
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:07,125
Are you in the right house? 

1184
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,375
Your wife is with you? 

1185
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,625
Anjali is with me. 

1186
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,041
Can I speak to her? 

1187
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,791
"No shawl. No pillow. The wind is to cold." 

1188
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,041
Sir! - I am looking for her! 

1189
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:21,916
Anjali! 

1190
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:24,333
Anjali! 

1191
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:28,041
I am coming home 

1192
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:35,333
Relax! - Relax! 

1193
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,291
Mr.. ? - K! 

1194
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:39,708
K what? - Just K 

1195
01:26:41,333 --> 01:26:42,875
What happened here? 

1196
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:44,333
That's what we're trying to find out! 

1197
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:47,291
Your wife? 

1198
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:49,625
She's disappeared? - She was with you? 

1199
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,916
Yes, she was with me and now she is not, she is disappeared. 

1200
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,916
There are too many strange things going on around me, do you know? 

1201
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:00,541
Can I see what is going on, upstairs? 

1202
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:04,000
This is my home, You know! 

1203
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,208
You continue. 

1204
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,291
Do you have anything to say? 

1205
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,541
Yes! 

1206
01:27:36,541 --> 01:27:38,333
I know who has done it? - Who? 

1207
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:39,541
Baba Bengali! 

1208
01:27:39,666 --> 01:27:40,791
Who Baba Bengali? 

1209
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:43,666
That rascal omnipresent Baba Bengali 

1210
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:46,958
Sewer Rat! Hitler's bastard child! 

1211
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,291
That genetic mistake.. 

1212
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:50,541
.. who runs The Laboratory! - Laboratory? 

1213
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,666
Why are you smoking a cigar? 

1214
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:57,083
Coz I like it! 

1215
01:27:57,791 --> 01:27:59,083
Who sent you here? 

1216
01:27:59,666 --> 01:28:00,958
What is this Laboratory? 

1217
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:15,000
I'll call him. 

1218
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,250
Hello. Welcome to The Laboratory 

1219
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:25,625
How can I help you? 

1220
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,375
Get Baba Bengali on the line. 

1221
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:28,666
You would be Mr.. ? 

1222
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:30,666
K.. from Bombay.. - Yes sir! 

1223
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:31,916
Greetings! 

1224
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Madam was just brought in a while ago.. 

1225
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,916
She's with Guruji in the Morgue.. 

1226
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,083
I'll get him on the line 

1227
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:42,125
Guruji! Its K 

1228
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,750
Yeah K 

1229
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:48,041
Why did you pick Anjali up? 

1230
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,875
You're forgetting the rules son.. 

1231
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,250
What rules? 

1232
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,416
I didn't even puff at it.. 

1233
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,250
Now what qualifies as a puff and what doesn't.. 

1234
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:58,083
.. aren't we the ones to decide that? 

1235
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,625
First things first.. - I did not smoke! 

1236
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,833
Alex forced that thing into my mouth! 

1237
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,041
You shouldn't have gone to the party.. and.. 

1238
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:09,208
.. if in your eyes that amounts to smoking it.. 

1239
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:13,000
.. then you should have taken my fingers not my wife.. . 

1240
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:15,333
.. when I smoke my third cigarette.. 

1241
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:18,458
Your fingers were being held by someone else. 

1242
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:20,875
Exactly! 

1243
01:29:21,041 --> 01:29:23,750
I was forced to put it in my mouth.. 

1244
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:26,083
It was shoved into my mouth! 

1245
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:28,916
But I spat it out before it was lit! 

1246
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,375
After it was lit! 

1247
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:31,625
Before it was lit! 

1248
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:33,041
After it was lit 

1249
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:34,541
Subsequent to it being lit! 

1250
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:35,791
Call the third umpire! 

1251
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,833
I am the sole umpire in this game 

1252
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:39,291
Be it the first or the second! 

1253
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:40,666
Either way, I'm the one who gets to raise the finger.. 

1254
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,041
Check it again 

1255
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:46,041
Ok. No harm in checking. 

1256
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:48,541
What is going on? 

1257
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,375
They are checking 

1258
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:51,875
What are they checking? 

1259
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:54,083
It's complicated! 

1260
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:02,416
Forward it 

1261
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:04,458
Idiot! A little more! 

1262
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:06,000
That's it! Stop. 

1263
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:12,083
Guruji! 

1264
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:17,625
What's the result? 

1265
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,208
He's telling the truth! 

1266
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,750
What! 

1267
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:23,666
The cigar had left his mouth when.. 

1268
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,916
Heard you the first time! I'm not deaf!! 

1269
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:29,583
His telling the truth means 

1270
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:31,666
We made the mistake? 

1271
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:33,916
Take him away! 

1272
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,791
Guruji! Please! Forgive me! 

1273
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:40,166
I messed up! I'm sorry 

1274
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,208
Listen K.. 

1275
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:49,000
It was a tough call! After all 

1276
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:52,125
Chaurasia is a little bit of a man 

1277
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:55,916
Such people always make little mistakes.. 

1278
01:30:56,625 --> 01:31:00,666
But the benefit of doubt in all likelihood must come to me 

1279
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:02,166
You can't do this! 

1280
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,416
One can't escape the inevitable 

1281
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:05,833
Let Anjali go! 

1282
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,666
She's gone! I've sent her away! 

1283
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,041
The body has already been examined.. 

1284
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,416
The Postmortem is finished! 

1285
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,250
The End - But.. 

1286
01:31:15,833 --> 01:31:18,375
.. you still owe me that one rupee! 

1287
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:21,583
She is killed by you, but the cops are here to arrest me! 

1288
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:22,958
I've lost everything! 

1289
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,625
But all you fucking want is your bloody rupee.. 

1290
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:27,791
Say whatever you will, I've wronged you 

1291
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,875
Explain it to them.. 

1292
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,291
Hello 

1293
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,333
Hello! 

1294
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:41,375
What is wrong? 

1295
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,125
Who were you talking to? - Guruji! 

1296
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,333
Alex! 

1297
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,791
Not Alex 

1298
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,208
Guruji! 

1299
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,333
Where'd he go? 

1300
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:02,166
I spoke to him in front of you. 

1301
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:05,916
What are you looking at? 

1302
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,083
I called him in front of you! 

1303
01:32:09,416 --> 01:32:10,666
I'll dial again 

1304
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:17,625
Please check the number you've dialed. 

1305
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,250
How can it be? 

1306
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,666
That Hitler spawned son of a bitch, Guruji! 

1307
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:23,166
It's ok Mr. Just K. 

1308
01:32:23,458 --> 01:32:24,833
You will have to come with us 

1309
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:27,333
Do I look like I have a morbid sense of humour? 

1310
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:28,541
Come with us 

1311
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:30,541
Wait, I can prove it! 

1312
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:32,416
I can prove it! 

1313
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:40,958
I love that, my friend. 

1314
01:32:42,375 --> 01:32:43,458
Hello. - Abbas! 

1315
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:48,000
Where are you? - Got the bad news friend - My condolences! 

1316
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,458
What news! 

1317
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:51,125
How did you know? 

1318
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:55,166
From the bulletin. He's sitting right across.. 

1319
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:57,458
Please can you come over! - Tell them! 

1320
01:32:58,125 --> 01:32:59,958
Nobody here believes me! 

1321
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:01,458
You want me to come over? 

1322
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:04,916
Alright! I am coming.. 

1323
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:08,250
He is coming! - Who is coming? 

1324
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:11,125
My friend.. 

1325
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:14,708
He had even lost his two fingers after he went to Guruji.. 

1326
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:16,458
Who is this guru-ji? 

1327
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,000
You know 

1328
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:21,583
I used to smoke a lot 

1329
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:24,333
And you feel the need to relinquish the cigarette. 

1330
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:26,000
Yes. 

1331
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:27,541
Consider it done 

1332
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:32,625
Thank you for coming Abbas.. 

1333
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:35,125
Tell them about The Laboratory! 

1334
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:36,750
What? - Tell them! 

1335
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:38,041
Tell them what? 

1336
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:39,333
About Baba Bengali? 

1337
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:41,000
Who Baba Bengali? 

1338
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:42,416
Abbas! 

1339
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:44,416
I don't know what you're talking about 

1340
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:46,041
You got me into this mess! 

1341
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:48,458
You got me into this bloody mess! 

1342
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:50,666
Show me the gloves! 

1343
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:51,916
What gloves? 

1344
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:53,666
Show me your fingers? 

1345
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:55,416
K.. What are you doing? - K.. K stop it.. 

1346
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:57,041
You are sick. 

1347
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,833
Show me your fingers? - K.. K stop it.. 

1348
01:33:58,916 --> 01:34:00,041
K.. K stop it.. 

1349
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:02,000
Here!! Have a good long look. ok!!! 

1350
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:03,416
Here! 

1351
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,000
Ok!! 

1352
01:34:05,666 --> 01:34:06,958
What are you doing to me? 

1353
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,125
What am I doing? 

1354
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,500
What am I doing? K ? 

1355
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:10,791
What am I doing? K? 

1356
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:12,583
Keep your mouth shut, 

1357
01:34:12,708 --> 01:34:14,041
Don't utter a single word. 

1358
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,208
Or your life will turn into hell. 

1359
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:17,375
You won't be able to understand what is going on. 

1360
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:18,875
Take care, K! 

1361
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:20,041
Take care of yourself! 

1362
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:21,458
Ok! 

1363
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:23,916
Bye!

"Kalkatta Carpets" 

1365
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:39,208
Please STOP him Sir! 

1366
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:41,083
I'm telling you there's nothing down there! 

1367
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:42,291
I've been working here the past 20 years! 

1368
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:43,875
I am telling you, there is a stairway right below this.. 

1369
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,708
.. that opens out into some Dharavi type slum 

1370
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:48,583
Right inside a veiled woman's house. 

1371
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:05,333
Awake? 

1372
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:12,041
You are the one who've passed out.. 

1373
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:22,041
You want proof? 

1374
01:35:25,291 --> 01:35:26,666
Where is my phone? 

1375
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:29,916
And a cigarette 

1376
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,958
Why don't I get a Black Label along with it! 

1377
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:34,416
This is the only way 

1378
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,750
I am still in the program. 

1379
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,583
I'll light up and that phone will ring. 

1380
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:50,333
I'll light this cigarette and my phone will ring. 

1381
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:53,833
And someone will say that my brother's disappeared. 

1382
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:57,125
"Take that drag" 

1383
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,208
"Take that drag"

"Take that drag" 

1385
01:36:01,416 --> 01:36:04,291
"Take that drag" 

1386
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:08,791
"Take that drag" 

1387
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:12,083
"Take that drag" 

1388
01:36:13,375 --> 01:36:20,958
"Take that drag" 

1389
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:27,125

01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:11,041
"Take that drag" 

1409
01:38:12,291 --> 01:38:13,541
Hello? 

1410
01:38:19,875 --> 01:38:21,000
What happened? 

1411
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:23,125
Your brother just killed himself.. 

1412
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:25,250
He was murdered.. 

1413
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:26,708
.. and it's all your fault 

1414
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,333
You are a co-accused 

1415
01:38:29,458 --> 01:38:30,583
We are sorry 

1416
01:38:30,708 --> 01:38:31,916
No. No. 

1417
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,458
Don't just be sorry! 

1418
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:35,041
You didn't believe me! 

1419
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:38,125
He committed suicide because I smoked a cigarette. 

1420
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,291
And you were the one who forced me to smoke a cigarette. - Hello. 

1421
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:44,875
Bye. 

1422
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:55,833
Your brother left a note.. 

1423
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:58,000
In which he holds you 

1424
01:38:58,041 --> 01:39:00,625
responsible for his non-existent lung 

1425
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:03,000
He blames you and your smoking.. 

1426
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:05,791
He blames me.. 

1427
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:07,458
He can't even write a word of Hindi 

1428
01:39:07,583 --> 01:39:09,000
He lived in Germany. 

1429
01:39:09,041 --> 01:39:11,291
He speaks German! He writes German! 

1430
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:15,125
How do you communicate with him? 

1431
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:16,500
Rather did? - What? 

1432
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:18,875
How did you communicate with him ? 

1433
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:22,208
What! - How did you talk to him? 

1434
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:25,708
My mother worked in the Embassy as an Interpreter.. 

1435
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,375
Still does.. 

1436
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:38,458
I must say.. 

1437
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:39,958
He's fooling around ! 

1438
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:42,791
Let's take him into custody 

1439
01:39:43,708 --> 01:39:47,125
He'll be singing loud and clear in four hours flat.. 

1440
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:51,166
Okay. 

1441
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,208
Let's go. 

1442
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:08,541
This place is full of water. 

1443
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:10,875
If it won't flood in Bombay where would it flood.. 

1444
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,250
Rajasthan!!! 

1445
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:14,750
Hello! 

1446
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:17,000
This place is flooded! 

1447
01:40:17,083 --> 01:40:18,583
You swim? 

1448
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:22,583
Hello! 

1449
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:24,291
Can you hear me? 

1450
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:26,666
Somebody get me out of here! 

1451
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:29,250
Is anybody here? 

1452
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:56,000
Keep your mouth shut, 

1453
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:58,666
he'll turn your life into a living nightmare.. 

1454
01:40:58,791 --> 01:41:00,250
You won't know the difference.. 

1455
01:41:00,375 --> 01:41:03,458
.. between when you are living and when you are dreaming? 

1456
01:42:02,916 --> 01:42:11,125
"In this jaundiced jungle, flows a river of smoke" 

1457
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:19,041
"In this jaundiced jungle, flows a river of smoke" 

1458
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:28,833
The last minute of the passing year and.. 

1459
01:42:28,916 --> 01:42:30,916
.. the next minute of the coming year.. 

1460
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,666
.. is called as the 0 minute. 

1461
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:35,041
And each year for the people under the program is a designated.. 

1462
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:37,458
place where you can smoke depending on which country you are in. 

1463
01:42:37,583 --> 01:42:40,166
"Everything is smoky." 

1464
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:44,333
"The leaves are all numb." 

1465
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:49,500
"I'm becoming restless every second." 

1466
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:54,000
"I'm surviving on those leaves." 

1467
01:42:55,791 --> 01:43:02,958
"My eyes that spoke, now wisps of smoke, the light gives way to dark" 

1468
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:11,833
"There is nobody around. I am very depressed.. " 

1469
01:43:11,916 --> 01:43:17,875
"There is a bit pain left. Now it is habitual.. " 

1470
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:25,958
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1471
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:33,625
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1472
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:36,500
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1473
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:39,833
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1474
01:43:39,916 --> 01:43:42,958
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1475
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,041
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1476
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:49,166
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1477
01:43:49,291 --> 01:43:52,291
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1478
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:58,583
"Smoke your life, smoke away your senses" 

1479
01:43:58,708 --> 01:44:02,041
"Smoke the weave of your breath-laced offenses" 

1480
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:05,000
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1481
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:09,041
"Smoke, stoke, smoke it" 

1482
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:24,500
"This heady high, and the whole world sways" 

1483
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:38,000
"This tongue-less lie will speak anyways" 

1484
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:46,416
"Smoke the word that scorches your lip" 

1485
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:52,416
"Smoke the ash of night to its tip" 

1486
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:00,416
"Smoke away the dark, the night is smoke" 

1487
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,500
10.. 9.. 

1488
01:45:02,625 --> 01:45:05,166
8.. - 7.. 

1489
01:45:05,291 --> 01:45:07,625
6.. 5.. 

1490
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,916
4.. 3.. 

1491
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:12,500
2.. 1.. 

1492
01:45:12,625 --> 01:45:13,708
And.. 

1493
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:16,916
'You have just gone into space-time.' 

1494
01:45:17,041 --> 01:45:22,208
You are no longer confined to physical objects.. 

1495
01:45:22,333 --> 01:45:24,833
.. aspects or surfaces that contain within them. 

1496
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:29,041
You'll now experience the power to identify a change. 

1497
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:32,083
It is a magic sensory feeling that influences.. 

1498
01:45:32,166 --> 01:45:34,958
.. a minor consequences of your charity. 

1499
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:38,916
You are now in the limits of multiphase. 

1500
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:42,416
But not beyond space, 

1501
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:46,708
A bit strange! 

1502
01:45:51,250 --> 01:46:01,041
"When the high has broken, it's shards fall near and far" 

1503
01:46:03,916 --> 01:46:12,791
"We pick the bits, collect our wits, what smoky fools we are" 

1504
01:46:31,166 --> 01:46:33,000
Hello? - K! 

1505
01:46:33,041 --> 01:46:34,166
Anjali? 

1506
01:46:34,291 --> 01:46:35,375
Where are you ? 

1507
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,500
You're alive! - What do you mean alive? 

1508
01:46:40,916 --> 01:46:42,375
I'm dreaming again.. 

1509
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:43,916
Why did you ask me if I was alive? 

1510
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,041
K! 

1511
01:46:50,125 --> 01:46:51,625
Why you doubt i am alive.. 

1512
01:46:52,375 --> 01:46:54,416
Do you remember that recurring dream I used to have, 

1513
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:56,875
every time I fell asleep in the bathtub! I found myself in the.. 

1514
01:46:56,958 --> 01:46:58,125
What are you talking about? 

1515
01:46:58,250 --> 01:46:59,333
My dream! 

1516
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:00,625
My dream. 

1517
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:02,875
Where are you? - How did you call me here? 

1518
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,291
I got the number from your office 

1519
01:47:04,416 --> 01:47:06,000
How? - K! 

1520
01:47:06,291 --> 01:47:07,666
I'm your wife! 

1521
01:47:07,791 --> 01:47:08,958
I'm your secretary! 

1522
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,125
Remember ! 

1523
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:14,041
You didn't want anyone at the office to know that I was your wife too 

1524
01:47:14,208 --> 01:47:15,958
You liked that they gossiped about us 

1525
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:18,041
What nonsense! 

1526
01:47:18,166 --> 01:47:19,875
My secretary got married! 

1527
01:47:19,958 --> 01:47:21,208
To you K! 

1528
01:47:21,333 --> 01:47:22,750
K please! - What's happened to you? 

1529
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:24,541
I think I'm having a nightmare 

1530
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:26,666
I need a cigarette! 

1531
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:28,041
I can't take this anymore 

1532
01:47:28,083 --> 01:47:30,083
I would rather that Guruji kill me.. 

1533
01:47:30,166 --> 01:47:31,541
If I smoke.. 

1534
01:47:31,666 --> 01:47:33,041
he'll kill me. 

1535
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:36,000
He'll kill me if I so much as light it 

1536
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:37,625
I'll call you back! 

1537
01:47:51,875 --> 01:47:53,041
Cigarette? 

1538
01:47:53,083 --> 01:47:54,750
No! - Close it! 

1539
01:48:08,916 --> 01:48:10,875
Open it, rascal. 

1540
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:25,750
Shoot me.. 

1541
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:26,958
Shoot me.. 

1542
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,500
Shoot me.. 

1543
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:30,000
Or give me a cigarette.. 

1544
01:48:30,041 --> 01:48:31,375
Give me a cigarette.. 

1545
01:48:32,541 --> 01:48:35,083
Give me a cigarette.. .. 

1546
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:37,083
Give me a cigarette, I wanna smoke.. 

1547
01:48:37,166 --> 01:48:38,625
Where are you taking me? 

1548
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:40,500
Please kill me, you fatso! 

1549
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:43,000
Kill me! 

1550
01:48:57,166 --> 01:48:59,666
And what's the bathtub doing in the middle of the snow desert.. 

1551
01:49:00,291 --> 01:49:01,583
I don't know.. 

1552
01:49:02,166 --> 01:49:06,000
Next time try jumping in it, instead.. 

1553
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:07,958
you might find another way.. 

1554
01:49:30,125 --> 01:49:31,666
Stop! 

1555
01:49:34,083 --> 01:49:37,833
Hey! I'm telling you! Stop! 

1556
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,958
Stop! I'll shoot 

1557
01:50:01,375 --> 01:50:02,583
Whaaaaat.. 

1558
01:50:56,291 --> 01:51:00,000
I was supposed to wake up in my bathtub. Why am I here? 

1559
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,500
He emerged from a cupboard. 

1560
01:51:03,541 --> 01:51:04,958
And he from a elmira.. 

1561
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:08,791
I always emerge from under the bed 

1562
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:12,875
They said they'd bathe us today 

1563
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:16,833
C'mon, let's go.. It's not him.. Let's go.. 

1564
01:51:57,541 --> 01:51:58,791
Your body.. 

1565
01:52:00,083 --> 01:52:01,750
He can't see you.. 

1566
01:52:10,916 --> 01:52:15,250
If you want, you can speak to him over the phone 

1567
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:19,583
All you need is a one rupee coin.. 

1568
01:52:27,708 --> 01:52:29,875
You forgot to give them the rupee, didn't you ? 

1569
01:52:31,958 --> 01:52:33,083
So did I? 

1570
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:46,916
K! 

1571
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,750
He says there's no problem now 

1572
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:03,958
Everything is fine! 

1573
01:53:04,666 --> 01:53:06,541
It'll all come back to you slowly 

1574
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:13,500
I felt as though someone was calling out to me. 

1575
01:53:13,708 --> 01:53:16,166
That was your voice.. 

1576
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:18,958
your inner self, 

1577
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:20,583
Your soul. 

1578
01:53:20,791 --> 01:53:22,083
Soul! 

1579
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,083
Smoke? 

1580
01:53:39,083 --> 01:53:40,208
Soul.. 

1581
01:53:41,166 --> 01:53:42,791
The inner soul.. 

1582
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,375
.. is often frivolous, debauch, indulgent.. 

1583
01:53:47,125 --> 01:53:51,500
.. but with a strong mind you can control it.. 

1584
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,208
.. but if you are inherently weak then my son, 

1585
01:53:54,333 --> 01:54:00,458
.. the wandering soul has to be released, let go.. 

1586
01:54:00,833 --> 01:54:02,333
Time for the bath. 

1587
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:19,416
The new guy. - What's the matter? 

1588
01:54:19,541 --> 01:54:21,291
In the black coat! 

1589
01:54:21,416 --> 01:54:24,000
Even he is going to be ruined. 

1590
01:54:24,958 --> 01:54:26,375
Who are these people? 

1591
01:54:28,125 --> 01:54:29,875
Why are they staring at me? 

1592
01:54:30,833 --> 01:54:32,125
Come with me. 

1593
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:33,333
Hello! 

1594
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:35,250
I'm asking you! 

1595
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:37,208
Move away from the windows! 

1596
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:39,791
Away from the windows! 

1597
01:54:39,875 --> 01:54:44,375
Those who have made the full payment need not take the bath. 

1598
01:54:44,833 --> 01:54:47,666
The rest please stand in a queue. 

1599
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,125
This bed.. 

1600
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:57,041
Don't know where it came from? 

1601
01:54:57,083 --> 01:54:58,583
This is my bed. 

1602
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:03,000
This is my table. - So, it is obvious that this chair belongs to you. 

1603
01:55:03,041 --> 01:55:04,291
No, only the table. 

1604
01:55:04,375 --> 01:55:06,250
Yes. 

1605
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:07,916
I was here. 

1606
01:55:08,291 --> 01:55:09,375
That's my name! 

1607
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:12,000
Yeah. Even I didn't get it the first time! 

1608
01:55:12,041 --> 01:55:14,083
I always came out of the bathtub.. 

1609
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:16,083
Me too! 

1610
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:20,041
Don't stop. Keep moving. 

1611
01:55:30,666 --> 01:55:31,791
What do we do? 

1612
01:55:31,875 --> 01:55:33,000
What do we do? 

1613
01:55:33,041 --> 01:55:34,458
He's fooling around with us.. 

1614
01:55:34,583 --> 01:55:37,125
Let's take him into custody. 

1615
01:55:37,291 --> 01:55:40,333
He'll be singing in four hours flat.. 

1616
01:55:43,125 --> 01:55:44,250
Ok. 

1617
01:55:44,375 --> 01:55:45,458
This is the same cop! 

1618
01:55:45,583 --> 01:55:49,416
Soul-full, the body is divine.. Soul-less, its dead.. 

1619
