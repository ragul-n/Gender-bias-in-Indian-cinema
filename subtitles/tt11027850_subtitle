1
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,715
Madam, are you going to take longer?

2
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,115
I had to close up, so

3
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:24,355
Yeah well
I've some work.

4
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:26,555
I'll let you know.
- Okay, madam.

5
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:52,115
Had I known that her reason to
stay back in the office wasn't work

6
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:55,515
Like those who stay in
office for long hours

7
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,995
because they don't
have a reason to go home.

8
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:01,235
I guess Sameera madam was like them.

9
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:06,275
She would stay back in the office
all alone even after everyone left.

10
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,315
Like she was waiting for someone

11
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,075
who was never going to show up.

12
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,275
Sam wait.

13
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,755
I need to talk to you.

14
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:07,395
I know there is no improvement.

15
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,715
There's no improvement at all.

16
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,075
And there's no scope either.

17
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:12,875
You know we're keeping
her only because

18
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:16,955
But I would still suggest
that we take her off life support.

19
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:18,595
The pain won't stop.

20
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,035
She is suffering, Sam.

21
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,675
And the worst part is
she can't even express it.

22
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:24,795
You will have to understand, Sam.

23
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:25,715
No.

24
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,515
Sam, she is clinically dead.
- No, she is not, Ravi.

25
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:30,715
How long are you going
to let your past dictate you?

26
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:32,755
Someday you will have
to face the truth, you need

27
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:33,395
You need to move on.

28
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,395
No, I can't do it, Ravi.
I can't.

29
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,235
I know that's why I am
trying to talk some sense in you

30
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:38,435
You've been this
difficult since college.

31
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:39,435
Still stubborn.

32
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:42,195
Waiting for something
good to happen is not stubborn.

33
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:44,115
Waiting seems practical
when there's hope

34
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:46,155
and unfortunately, in this case,

35
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:48,435
we can't expect a miracle to happen.

36
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,995
There's always a miracle
in everyone's life.

37
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:52,475
I am waiting for mine.

38
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:55,675
Maybe there will be
a miracle in my life too.

39
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:57,395
You know there's one
thing about you, Sam.

40
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:00,115
You always turn your
back on your problems.

41
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,875
You think ignoring it will
magically solve all your problems.

42
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,515
But that's not true.

43
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:08,595
Every problem needs to be solved.

44
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:10,515
Bye.

45
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:37,875
Tiwari.

46
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,875
Tiwari, who parked the
bike in my parking space.

47
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:41,755
Sam. Sam.

48
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,035
No need to call Tiwari.

49
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:44,675
I parked Sudhir's bike.

50
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,755
To save your parking space.

51
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,635
You're such a darling, Vivek.

52
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,315
I know, right.

53
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:59,555
If it wasn't for you, it would've
been difficult to live here.

54
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:01,635
But I am here.

55
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:02,995
So no problem.

56
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:06,515
Yeah, that's true.

57
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:09,275
Well, see you.

58
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:10,835
Thank you so much for carrying this.

59
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:11,355
No problem.

60
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:12,715
Good night, then.
- Good night.

61
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,315
Sam,

62
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:16,155
are you okay?

63
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,435
Why?

64
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:19,435
What's wrong with me?

65
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,475
I am fine.

66
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:56,555
Granny, I am thinking of enrolling
you in a rock-climbing workshop.

67
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:58,675
Cool.

68
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:00,635
But what do they do?

69
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:02,595
The same thing that
you're already doing.

70
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,555
What's the need to do these stunts?

71
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:08,235
Talk to your parents.

72
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:10,755
They've been driving me up the wall
calling continuously from New York.

73
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:12,435
Why? What did they do this time?

74
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:14,915
Your college documents.

75
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,715
But you don't understand.

76
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,355
First, get down.

77
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:22,555
No, first I must
- I said get down.

78
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:23,715
Please, just get down.

79
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:26,195
Careful. Get down.

80
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:31,275
Just give them all the documents
and close this chapter once for all.

81
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:32,915
Yes, I'll do that this week.

82
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,795
But you must take care of your health.

83
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,315
Take your pill.

84
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,355
Everyone has a secret, sir.

85
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,875
Maybe Sameera madam was sad because

86
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:32,315
there were many secrets
hidden in her heart as well.

87
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:35,395
Or maybe she was
someone's little secret.

88
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:54,315
Hi

89
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:55,355
Rohan Malhotra.

90
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,155
I stay in the apartment
right below yours.

91
00:08:57,355 --> 00:08:59,315
We talked on the
phone about the leakage

92
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:00,555
Oh yes, yes

93
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:01,835
I am so sorry.
Please come in.

94
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:02,995
Come in.

95
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:04,715
This way.

96
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,555
I guess the leakage is
in this bedroom's washroom.

97
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:12,555
Wow! What a beautiful piano!

98
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:15,235
Steinway huh!

99
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:16,955
How do you know?

100
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:18,315
I am a music director.

101
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,915
But frankly,
this music director has music

102
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:24,435
but no one gave me
a chance for direction.

103
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:26,715
You will find one soon. I am sure.

104
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,515
I am hoping.

105
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:29,355
Anyway, I've some work to finish.
You carry on, please.

106
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:30,595
Sure.

107
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:48,595
Sam?

108
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:50,435
Sameera Khanna, right?

109
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:52,355
Yes, sir.

110
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,595
Om Kapoor.

111
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:56,675
Everyone knows you.

112
00:09:57,315 --> 00:09:58,795
They all know me,

113
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,595
but not completely.

114
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:12,315
I love you!

115
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,475
I love you too.

116
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,395
I promise I will leave her, okay.

117
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,515
I want to be with you, Sam.

118
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:29,275
Govind, check the shower area.

119
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:30,835
Maybe the leakage is on this side.

120
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:01,955
Were you making coffee yourself?

121
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:04,155
No, it was a long queue
- Hey, Vivek, wait!

122
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:07,475
You didn't wait for me inside.
I was looking all over for you.

123
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:09,395
Anyway, thanks for fixing the Wifi.

124
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,435
My engineer was stalling
me for the last two days

125
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:13,355
but you fixed it in five minutes.

126
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:14,875
It's no big deal.
- It is.

127
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:17,275
And you know what,
from now on your coffee is free.

128
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:18,235
On the house.

129
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,355
And here's your money back.

130
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:21,835
Thank you.

131
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:23,915
Okay

132
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:24,755
Yes

133
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,955
I am impressed.

134
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,195
Nice. You help everyone out.

135
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,715
I learned a term in my college.

136
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,915
"Symbiosis"

137
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:38,115
which means helping
each other to survive.

138
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,995
We all need each other.

139
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:44,275
Like you need me to get you
coffee in a no-parking zone.

140
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,875
Similarly,
I need a free ride to my college.

141
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:48,155
Symbiosis.

142
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,955
Actually, drop me off on MG Road.

143
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:56,395
Your phone which we gave for
repairing must have been fixed by now.

144
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:57,835
I'll pick it up and go to college.

145
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:00,075
Damn I had completely
forgotten about it.

146
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,115
But see, you remember.

147
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,555
You're a good friend to have, Vivek.

148
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,635
Goldie, did you send the consignment?

149
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:09,675
Yes.
- Okay.

150
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:10,635
What have you done?

151
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,035
It doesn't even turn on anymore.

152
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,675
Did you fix it or make it worse?

153
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:16,355
Remember I said, chances are slim.

154
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,555
There's no guarantee it can be fixed.

155
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,715
It only had a faulty
touch-sensitivity.

156
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:22,115
But it doesn't even turn on anymore.

157
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:23,635
You just made it worse.

158
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:24,635
Why take it if you can't fix it?

159
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,075
Don't try to teach me
how to run my business, okay.

160
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:31,955
I've had this shop when you were
still running around in your diapers.

161
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:35,475
I opened the first
mobile store in this area.

162
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:37,155
You stole the parts, didn't you?

163
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:38,635
You stole it, didn't you?

164
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,595
Don't try to be a wise guy.

165
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:42,635
Is this how you do business?

166
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:44,315
Get lost.

167
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,315
Take a walk.

168
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:46,275
Get lost.

169
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:47,635
What are you staring at?

170
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,155
Do I have to push you out now?

171
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:01,795
Yes.
- Hi, Sam.

172
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:04,195
Your phone hasn't been fixed yet.

173
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,035
It will take another 2 days.

174
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:07,835
That's okay, That's okay.
No worries.

175
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:08,915
Bye.

176
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:11,675
Sam, everyone's waiting
for you in the board room.

177
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:12,955
Hurry up.
- Yeah.

178
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:17,195
So, team, I have a special
reason to assemble all of you here.

179
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:19,475
I am retiring.

180
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:22,595
And my talented daughter
Nandini will step in my place.

181
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,835
Effective from today
she's the company's new CEO.

182
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:27,075
Please welcome her.

183
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,155
Congratulations, and welcome.

184
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,875
Thank you, everyone.

185
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,315
My mom didn't just hand over this job

186
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:36,715
in fact,
she's also given me a challenge.

187
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:39,875
My target is to double
the sales in my first year.

188
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,915
And I can never do
it without all of you.

189
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:44,115
Especially you, Sam.

190
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:45,475
Oh yes, of course.

191
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:46,475
Whatever we can do.

192
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:47,475
Good.

193
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:50,755
Because I want to change the
content strategy for our magazine.

194
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:53,315
Parade's content
quality is quite good,

195
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:55,075
but it's also outdated.

196
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:58,875
The millennial generation
is bored of relationship talks.

197
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:01,635
They want sex and lust stories.

198
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:03,315
And we'll give them that.

199
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,915
Excuse me  what?

200
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:06,675
Yes, Sam. You don't seem to agree.

201
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:10,555
No, I mean sales have been
affected in the last few months

202
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:11,555
Months you say?

203
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:12,595
One full year.

204
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:14,635
But everyone's going digital,
Nandini, and you know it.

205
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,635
And as a magazine,
we're still fighting.

206
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:18,195
Exactly, that's my point.

207
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:19,155
We have to fight.

208
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:20,955
Parade has its own identity.

209
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,515
We're known for our content.

210
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:25,355
Market strategies and
trends will keep changing.

211
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:27,795
But that should force us
to lose our identity, Nandini.

212
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,475
And the kind of content
you are suggesting

213
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:31,795
well, everyone is offering that.

214
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,435
So how will that separate
us from them if we do the same thing?

215
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:37,395
If they are booking profits
at the end of the year

216
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:40,275
then I'll be happy if
Parade joins that bandwagon.

217
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:41,595
Nandini, listen,
what I am trying to say is

218
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:44,875
Please Sameera, I know mom
ran this business on her ideals

219
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,715
but now I want to run it on mine.

220
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:48,475
And my method is pretty simple.

221
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,635
Put your money where
your mouth is or just shut up.

222
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,555
Well, ladies, there will
be many more debates on content.

223
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:55,155
This is just the first meeting.

224
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,995
Nandini, will you join me for lunch?

225
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:58,235
Sure, mom.

226
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:04,955
Hello, ma'am.

227
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,075
What are you doing here?

228
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,915
Om sir had a shoot close-by.

229
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:10,955
And he said I should ask
you whether you can spare the time.

230
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,315
And come with me.

231
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,275
Tell your boss I don't have time.

232
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:16,475
I am busy.

233
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:17,715
Leave.

234
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:23,675
Deven.

235
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:27,715
Sameera madam was very nice.

236
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,395
She loved Om sir.

237
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,555
And Mr. Om Kapoor.

238
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:33,435
I am sure Om sir loved her too.

239
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,275
Why else would anyone
cheat on his wife?

240
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:38,755
I earned these wealth,
luxury, and leisure on my own

241
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,755
so you don't have the bloody
right to tell me how to live.

242
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:42,715
Okay.

243
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:44,475
Nobody has the right
to tell me how to live.

244
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:02,115
So the TCP/IP protocol makes the
internet. - Ma'am, may I come in?

245
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:04,195
Go sit quickly.

246
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:05,955
makes the internet possible.

247
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:10,115
The server then listens
to the node board.

248
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:11,355
Come on, baby.

249
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,395
Don't baby me, I am serious.

250
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:16,195
I've been here for over an hour,
waiting for you.

251
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:18,915
And now when you come,
you don't even ask me how I am.

252
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:21,115
Are you just interested
in having a good time?

253
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:22,755
Why would I wanna have a bad time?

254
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,315
I am serious?

255
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:28,235
So the connection between the
two is then switched to another port.

256
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,195
Thus making the initial port free.

257
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:32,155
Did you talk to Amrita
yet about the divorce?

258
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:33,995
Come on, let's not do this right now.

259
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,515
No, we have to do it now.

260
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,235
Tell me, did you speak to her?

261
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,235
My film's about to release.

262
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:43,835
I can't afford a scandal right now.

263
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:45,635
When then, Om?

264
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,955
You have a release every six months.

265
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:49,395
How much longer do I have to wait?

266
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,915
Do you have any idea
what I am going through?

267
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:53,835
The day we met you said
you're on a road to divorce

268
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,395
that is why I dated you.

269
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,035
I am not some

270
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:01,275
I am not some kind of mistress

271
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:04,075
who will spend the rest
of her life with you like this.

272
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:09,635
Sam, what you and I have.

273
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:12,395
This is real.

274
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:15,835
My marriage with Amrita
is just a compromise.

275
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:16,875
It's a sham.

276
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:22,715
You and only you are
the woman that I love.

277
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:26,675
Sam, this is all just temporary.

278
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:30,035
In the end,
it's us who will be together.

279
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:32,755
And what am I asking you for?

280
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:34,555
Just a little time.

281
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:36,635
You can't give me that.

282
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:40,755
Don't you trust me?

283
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,915
I do.

284
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:27,275
I've been telling you for days now.

285
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:28,875
And you haven't found the time yet.

286
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,075
Do you even understand
the importance of this?

287
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:34,035
I've spoken with reputed
colleges over here for you.

288
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:36,875
And you can't find the
time to find your certificates.

289
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,395
I am sorry,
I was quite busy last week.

290
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:42,595
Busy with what?

291
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:44,915
Mohan, don't stress yourself.

292
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,635
It affects your blood pressure.

293
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:48,195
I'll take care of the certificates.

294
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:49,755
Let it be.

295
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,635
Dad is just trying to help you out.

296
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,435
You insisted on finishing
your graduation in India.

297
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:56,555
Vivek, we're talking to you.

298
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:58,235
Where is your focus?

299
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:01,075
I've to go.

300
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,595
I love you guys, sorry.

301
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:03,915
What?

302
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:04,835
Vivek.

303
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:07,875
You talk some sense in him.

304
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:09,123
He doesn't listen to us.

305
00:19:25,594 --> 00:19:26,594
Listen

306
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:31,514
Let it be.

307
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:19,914
Hello.

308
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:21,474
Is this Police Control?

309
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:27,314
Who do you guys think you are?

310
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:28,594
I'm not going to take this lightly.

311
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:30,354
Being a cop doesn't give
you the right to do as you please.

312
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:32,554
This is no way to treat a common man.

313
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:33,834
Even I have contacts.

314
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,274
I'll screw your life.

315
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:36,434
I'll get you fired from your job.

316
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:40,314
Uncle, as I said there
was a misunderstanding.

317
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:41,354
Understand.

318
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:43,154
Your name was on the most-wanted list.

319
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:44,514
And we received a tip-off.

320
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:47,682
We're letting you go now after
the confusion's been cleared.

321
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,314
Now get lost.

322
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:50,594
Get lost.

323
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:54,634
It's you.

324
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:57,074
Weird.

325
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:58,834
You told me to take a walk

326
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:00,554
and took a trip to
the Police Station yourself.

327
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:04,314
Now you'll give me a new phone
in exchange for the one you damaged.

328
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,794
Otherwise, I can make the
jail your permanent residence.

329
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:14,314
You look innocent,
but you're a rascal.

330
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,874
Stop wasting my time
and give me that phone.

331
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:19,594
It's someone special's birthday today.

332
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,034
Happy Birthday to you.

333
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:24,674
Happy Birthday to you.

334
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:27,874
Happy Birthday dear Sam.

335
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:29,994
Happy Birthday to you.

336
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:31,314
Happy Birthday

337
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:34,954
From my boss.

338
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:35,914
Thank you.

339
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:44,434
I just got your gift.

340
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:45,954
Thank you so much.

341
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,194
But since it's my birthday,
I have a request.

342
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:50,074
Anything baby, just ask.

343
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:53,194
One evening, for me.

344
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:54,914
Please.

345
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:57,914
There's a party at
home in the evening.

346
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:01,274
If you don't show up,
I'll be completely alone.

347
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:02,834
Please don't say no.

348
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,194
Okay, I'll be there.

349
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:05,314
Promise.

350
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:06,554
It's your birthday, baby.

351
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:07,674
I am going to come.

352
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:08,914
Thank you.

353
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,234
Oh my, God. I can't take this.

354
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,594
I mean I liked it.

355
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:16,394
Thank you so much.

356
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:18,194
But such an expensive gift, Vivek.

357
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:20,074
Did you spend your
entire pocket money on it?

358
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:21,834
Come on, Sam, it's your birthday.

359
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,554
And anyway,
there's no return policy on it.

360
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:25,514
So please have it. Just take it.

361
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:28,114
Okay, fine.

362
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:31,234
But promise me,
no more expensive gifts next time.

363
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:33,474
And if you do, I'll return it.

364
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:35,354
No matter if there's
a return policy on it or not.

365
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:35,834
Okay.

366
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:36,714
Deal?
- Deal.

367
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:38,754
Now, come give me a hug.

368
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:42,274
Thank you.

369
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,634
Now go get drunk.

370
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:46,954
Hey, Sam.

371
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:49,394
Hi.
How are you?

372
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:50,434
I am good. How are you?

373
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:51,554
Very good.

374
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,634
Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you so much.

375
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:54,674
And, this is for you.

376
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:56,754
Thanks again.

377
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,434
And thank you so much for coming.

378
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:01,274
Agra's special sweets.

379
00:23:01,354 --> 00:23:02,634
Oh my, God.

380
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:03,954
This is my favourite.

381
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:04,874
How do you know?

382
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:06,042
Well, lucky guess.

383
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:06,915
Okay.

384
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:12,114
I was wondering, what do you
give a person who has everything.

385
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,474
But then I figured those
who have it all

386
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:17,394
often don't have one thing.

387
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:18,674
I see. What's that?

388
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:20,194
Childhood.

389
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:21,634
Childhood?

390
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:25,314
Things that we used
to like in our childhood

391
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:27,274
we get separated from it.

392
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:30,874
By the way, you've been
staring at that door all the time.

393
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:32,994
Are you expecting someone special?

394
00:23:33,154 --> 00:23:34,674
No. Not at all.

395
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,194
For me every guest is special.

396
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,154
Anyway, please make
yourself comfortable.

397
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,674
I'll just be back.

398
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:41,154
Excuse me.

399
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:56,794
There are girls, there's wine,
there's cheese, there's all of that.

400
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:58,634
But guess what, how do I stay warm?

401
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,834
Tequila baby, tequila.

402
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:13,754
And I swear I am so

403
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:15,794
Really?
- Truly.

404
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:17,754
Oh, please

405
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:30,006
"Let the heart not
get addicted to anyone "

406
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:38,554
"Let the heart not
get addicted to anyone "

407
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:46,478
"May we never fall in love again."

408
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:55,116
"Let the heart not
get addicted to anyone "

409
00:24:55,634 --> 00:25:03,258
"May we never fall in love again."

410
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:14,063
"I've no desire to love anymore."

411
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:15,394
Happy Birthday.

412
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:23,466
"May you never need me again."

413
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:31,685
"May you never need me again."

414
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:39,634
"May we never fall in love again."

415
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:11,774
"Pain has become my refuge "

416
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:16,711
" and not my desires."

417
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:22,834
"Being apart has taught me to live "

418
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:27,707
" you're not the only one I need."

419
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:38,959
"I've no desires to crave for anyone "

420
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:47,567
"May you never control my heart ever."

421
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:55,967
"May you never control my heart ever."

422
00:26:56,314 --> 00:27:04,273
"May we never fall in love again."

423
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:23,034
Why are you doing this?

424
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:25,594
I'll do it in the morning.

425
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:27,154
I'll manage.

426
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:29,087
Yeah, it's okay.

427
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:31,354
And anyway, you look really tired.

428
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:32,914
Let me do it.

429
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:36,354
I am not tired.

430
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:38,194
I am drunk.

431
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:40,438
Actually, you know what

432
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:44,451
Let me help you.

433
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,874
Sam. Sam.

434
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:25,314
What happened?

435
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:36,915
If I had known that I would have
to suffer so much humiliation in love

436
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:42,144
then I would've never
let Om come so close to me.

437
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:45,049
Makes me feel like a beggar.

438
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:46,794
Beggar.

439
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:52,239
He's turned me into a beggar.

440
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:57,554
I am begging for love, Vivek.

441
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:00,321
I am begging for it.

442
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:03,314
I am begging for it.

443
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:07,732
It's okay, Sam.

444
00:29:08,674 --> 00:29:09,554
Sam.

445
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,294
It's okay. It's okay.

446
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:12,514
It's not okay.

447
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:17,732
It's not okay.

448
00:29:21,674 --> 00:29:22,874
It's not okay.

449
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,474
Sam.

450
00:31:58,714 --> 00:32:00,234
Is everything okay?

451
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,754
Sam. I can hear you.

452
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:05,360
Open the door.

453
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:10,834
Sam.

454
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:18,354
That was Om, wasn't it?

455
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:20,074
I can handle this.

456
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:20,834
I won't let anything happen to you.

457
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:24,274
Listen, I am getting late for office.

458
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:26,154
I think you should go home.
We'll talk later.

459
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:27,187
Excuse me.

460
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:38,059
Oh sh**

461
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:40,634
Sh** Sh** Sh** Sh**

462
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:42,434
What have I done?

463
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:43,648
Sh**

464
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:03,034
Sam, are you with us?
- Yes.

465
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:04,794
If you've recovered from your
party mood, can we get some work done?

466
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:05,594
Yeah.

467
00:33:07,114 --> 00:33:12,105
So, team, I want to very seriously
discuss the figures for this quarter.

468
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:13,874
Okay.

469
00:33:14,114 --> 00:33:15,154
You have the report.

470
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:19,634
Hi. I am here for Sam.

471
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:21,214
She is in a meeting right now.

472
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:22,314
Could you wait for a while?

473
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:23,434
Sure.

474
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:26,921
Sam.

475
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:29,088
We are down by 13%!

476
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:32,208
Our investors are
threatening to pull out

477
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:35,448
and you still can't get
over your birthday hangover!

478
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:39,048
If you're no longer interested
in working, then you can quit!

479
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,408
I can always find
someone to replace you.

480
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:42,768
Did you get that?

481
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:50,853
Actually,
Sam and I were not too close.

482
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:52,773
We were just colleagues.

483
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:56,173
Basically, she was the
chief-editor in my company.

484
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:59,453
I don't know much
about her personal life.

485
00:34:00,213 --> 00:34:02,813
And I've no clue about Vivek at all.

486
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:04,133
Good afternoon, guys.

487
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,973
Time for Sam's lunch.

488
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:07,773
Since its lunchtime,
all of you go grab some lunch.

489
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:08,933
Please, move out.

490
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:11,773
You're always busy.

491
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:12,973
When are you going to eat?

492
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:15,253
Guys, what?

493
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:18,324
Happy lunch. Leave.

494
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:26,253
Look. Salad, Biryani, your favourite.

495
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,413
And it's from your
favourite restaurant.

496
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,933
I am sure you will love it.

497
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:32,133
Hey what's up?

498
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:33,802
I think we need to talk.

499
00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:35,493
What?

500
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:39,893
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

501
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:42,453
Bringing my lunch to my office

502
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,213
And how were you talking
to my colleagues?

503
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,133
What is all this?

504
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:48,293
Sam, you don't know, but

505
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:52,693
you desperately need
someone to take care of you.

506
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:55,053
What do you mean?

507
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,333
I mean

508
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:00,293
you let people walk all over you.

509
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:02,853
Like that lady in the conference room.

510
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,213
How rude was she?

511
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:05,333
How dare she?

512
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:06,693
Wait a second.

513
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:09,093
That lady is the
owner of this magazine.

514
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,893
And creative differences
are common, Vivek.

515
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:11,893
No big deal.

516
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:13,853
Why am I even explaining this to you?

517
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:14,613
You know what?

518
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:16,173
You can't do this, that's it.

519
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:17,053
Okay.

520
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:17,853
Sam,

521
00:35:19,004 --> 00:35:23,442
in this whole wide-world I maybe
the only one who can support you.

522
00:35:23,653 --> 00:35:25,853
I'll support you in every
- Wait a minute.

523
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:28,053
I am not helpless.

524
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:29,453
What's wrong with you?

525
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:31,693
You know what, please leave.

526
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:33,053
You must leave, go.

527
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,333
I also have a lot of work to finish.

528
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:35,813
So please leave, okay.

529
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:48,733
Tiwari.

530
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:50,573
Tiwari.

531
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:53,893
What is this?

532
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:55,173
What's wrong now, madam?

533
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,173
Someone else parked in my space again.

534
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:58,493
Madam, the owner
- Listen

535
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,213
of this car is also
a member of this society.

536
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:01,173
Yes.

537
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:05,373
Does it ever happen to
you that you need someone

538
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:09,053
but you don't realise
that you need him.

539
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,453
What do you mean?

540
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:30,653
In recent news, the shares
of Reges Media took a nosedive.

541
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:35,173
According to experts, this
could directly affect Parade Magazine.

542
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:38,573
On the other hand, this
incident is being deemed historic.

543
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,973
The drop in shares prices of media
companies is not a common occurance.

544
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:46,013
On the other hand,
this can come as a big shock to

545
00:36:46,093 --> 00:36:48,373
Parade Magazine and
their partner companies

546
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:51,573
and can directly affect their
relationship with their investors.

547
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:52,173
Hi

548
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:57,453
Last night some sensitive information
was leaked from our company

549
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,300
which is strongly affecting
our reputation

550
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,293
and our shares in the market.

551
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:08,091
Investors have decided to pull out
from our company after this quarter.

552
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:09,373
Oh my, God.

553
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:11,533
But, how did this happen?

554
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:12,853
Do you have any idea
how this happened?

555
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:15,853
My guess is we've been hacked.

556
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:17,133
What?

557
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:20,133
The information that was
leaked was saved in my draft folder.

558
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,733
I didn't even send it.

559
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:25,773
I shared some of my concerns on that
mail regarding the company with mom.

560
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:27,773
Anyway.

561
00:37:28,151 --> 00:37:31,011
Shekhar and his team
are the best IT guys around.

562
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:33,053
They will be
investigating this matter.

563
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:36,173
I am requesting everyone to
cooperate with them, in every way.

564
00:37:36,394 --> 00:37:37,326
Yeah, sure.

565
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:38,693
Yrah.

566
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:49,933
Hello.

567
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,139
Did your boss learn her lesson?

568
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:52,773
What?

569
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,333
She was yelling at you.

570
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:55,973
So I thought of teaching her a lesson.

571
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:58,133
So I dropped the prices
of her company's shares.

572
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:00,493
What?

573
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:02,813
You did this?

574
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:06,213
Of course, Sam. You need me.

575
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:07,933
You just don't realise it yet.

576
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:09,253
I did it.

577
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,853
You don't know me.

578
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:15,246
For your kind information,
your boyfriend is a hacker.

579
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:18,453
Where are you right now?

580
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:20,123
Meet me at the coffee shop right now.

581
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,487
Do you have any idea what you've done?

582
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:32,887
Do you know the losses my
Company suffered because of you?

583
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:35,767
You fuc*** hacked my boss' account.

584
00:38:35,887 --> 00:38:36,807
Are you crazy?

585
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:40,367
I did all this for you.

586
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:44,527
If someone treats you unfairly,
then I must punish him.

587
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:46,647
You never do anything.
- Listen.

588
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:48,567
You don't need to do anything for me,

589
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:50,047
I can take care of myself.

590
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:52,247
Come on, Sam.

591
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:55,207
You've turned suffering
into your fashion statement.

592
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:58,607
So it was important to
show you what I can do for you.

593
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:00,287
And you don't have
to tolerate everyone.

594
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:02,167
Neither Nandini, no Om

595
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:04,487
Listen, do you understand
what I am saying.

596
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:06,287
Are you even listening to me?

597
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:11,367
I never gave you the right to interfere
in my personal matters, Vivek.

598
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:12,967
Do you understand that?

599
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:15,007
I thought you were my friend.

600
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:19,087
But judging by your actions,
I was so wrong about you.

601
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,927
I mean, whenever you
feel like we're friends

602
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,527
and on other times I am your lover.

603
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:25,287
What is this?

604
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:26,367
Get over it.

605
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,287
Get over it!

606
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:30,207
I made a mistake, Vivek.

607
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:32,247
Whatever

608
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:35,767
Whatever happened
between us was a mistake.

609
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,287
Mistake?

610
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:40,927
You used me to get
rid of your loneliness.

611
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:42,447
This is what you mean?
- That's it.

612
00:39:43,487 --> 00:39:44,567
That's it.

613
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:48,047
You have two choices.

614
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:50,447
Either you understand
me or you misunderstand me.

615
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,247
And I really don't care, Vivek.

616
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:54,167
Or you can also understand me.
- What?

617
00:39:54,447 --> 00:39:55,287
Understand what?

618
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:56,127
That I fu*** love you.

619
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:57,367
I really do.
I love you.

620
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:58,407
You mean a lot to me.

621
00:39:58,487 --> 00:39:59,207
Just understand this.

622
00:39:59,287 --> 00:39:59,927
I really do.

623
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:01,607
I can do anything for you.

624
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:03,047
Don't do this.

625
00:40:03,127 --> 00:40:04,127
Just don't do this.

626
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:06,127
You're breaking my heart.
- Vivek, listen.

627
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:07,767
Listen, Vivek.

628
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,847
Do you even know the meaning of love?

629
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,047
Do you even know this?

630
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:13,527
You're just 19.

631
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:15,127
You're a 19-year-old boy.

632
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,927
Didn't you remember that
I was 19 when you were kissing me?

633
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:24,567
Or when you were sleeping with me,
didn't you remember that I am 19?

634
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,207
Or when you were screaming

635
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:28,567
"Vivek  Vivek, don't stop.
Don't stop!"

636
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,247
Shut up!

637
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:34,087
Just shut up!

638
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:43,807
Stay away from me!

639
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:47,487
I don't want to see
your face ever-ever again.

640
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:31,167
"I am fixated on making you mine "

641
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:34,247
" no matter what the world says."

642
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:37,807
"I'll write your destiny "

643
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:40,967
" doesn't matter what God has to say."

644
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:44,327
"I am fixated on making you mine "

645
00:41:44,407 --> 00:41:47,607
" no matter what the world says."

646
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:50,967
"I'll write your destiny "

647
00:41:51,047 --> 00:41:54,247
" doesn't matter what God has to say."

648
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:57,407
"Your happiness, your sorrows,

649
00:41:57,567 --> 00:42:00,007
your identity "

650
00:42:00,047 --> 00:42:02,727
" matters to me."

651
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,727
"Without you, I refuse to live."

652
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:10,527
"The pain "

653
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:13,654
"This pain "

654
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:17,247
"This pain is my love "

655
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,561
"It's my love."

656
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:23,512
"The pain "

657
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,047
"This pain "

658
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,367
"This pain is my love "

659
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,776
"It's my love."

660
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:40,327
This case was disputed for many years.

661
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,087
As a result, it was rusting away.

662
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:44,887
Of course, I am interested in selling.

663
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:47,430
But one thing puzzles me.

664
00:42:47,696 --> 00:42:49,927
What is your interest in this place?

665
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:53,287
Bro, I hope you're not
into some shady business.

666
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:55,647
Yeah, I am a terrorist.

667
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:56,487
I make bombs.

668
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,487
It was just a routine question.

669
00:42:58,607 --> 00:42:59,727
Just for confirmation.

670
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:00,847
College project.

671
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:02,527
I don't mind.

672
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:04,527
But remember not to
get in any kind of a mess.

673
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:06,927
Otherwise, we'll both get in trouble.

674
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:10,127
Thank you.

675
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:14,087
"Your happiness, your sorrows,

676
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:18,424
your identity "
" matters to me."

677
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:23,324
"Without you, I refuse to exist."

678
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,327
"The pain "

679
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:29,411
"This pain "

680
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,967
"This pain is my love "

681
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:36,314
"It's my love."

682
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:39,527
"The pain "

683
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:42,692
"This pain "

684
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:46,047
"This pain is my love "
- Good morning, Sam.

685
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:49,266
"It's my love."

686
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:04,207
All the best.

687
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,967
Today is a very special day.

688
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,403
Hello.

689
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:38,967
Sam's here.

690
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,927
Yeah, okay.

691
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:58,327
What is all this, Nandini?

692
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,367
Why am I being treated like this?

693
00:45:01,607 --> 00:45:05,693
Shekhar and his team were
investigating who hacked our company.

694
00:45:05,847 --> 00:45:08,647
Shekhar's theory was that
the leak came from inside our office.

695
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:09,847
And guess what,

696
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,207
Shekhar was right.

697
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:13,127
The leak was from inside our office.

698
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:14,127
What?

699
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:15,847
Who did it? Who's done this?

700
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:18,567
Amazing. You're acting so innocent.

701
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:20,367
I know, Sam.

702
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:22,367
The leak was from your laptop.

703
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:23,287
What?

704
00:45:23,727 --> 00:45:24,887
My laptop?

705
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:27,647
What are you talking about, Nandini?
- Shekhar, please.

706
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:30,287
What are you talking about?

707
00:45:31,847 --> 00:45:32,927
Is this your laptop?

708
00:45:33,127 --> 00:45:34,007
Yeah.

709
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:36,327
And were these emails
sent from your laptop?

710
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:44,367
Oh my, God.

711
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:45,607
I

712
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:46,967
I didn't send these.

713
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:50,567
Your laptop was used to send emails,
but you didn't send them.

714
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:51,607
No.

715
00:45:52,007 --> 00:45:53,647
Then these logs must be fake too.

716
00:45:57,127 --> 00:45:59,827
This proves that Nandini's
system was accessed from your laptop.

717
00:46:00,807 --> 00:46:01,527
You didn't do this either.

718
00:46:01,607 --> 00:46:02,927
Of course, I didn't, seriously.

719
00:46:03,047 --> 00:46:04,207
Nandini, you have to trust me.

720
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,367
I've not done all this.

721
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:06,407
Please!

722
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:07,607
Save it!

723
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:10,245
The company's reputation is at stake

724
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:13,044
that's why I am not lodging
an official complaint against you.

725
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:16,527
But you're fired
effective immediately.

726
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,487
You are fired!

727
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:18,487
Grab your stuff and leave!

728
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,527
Just leave!

729
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:18,807
See what I can do.

730
00:47:19,327 --> 00:47:20,767
There's still time, Sam.

731
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,775
I can make things like they were.

732
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:28,827
Or make things worse that
you won't know what hit you.

733
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,687
You have until 6 tomorrow.

734
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:32,778
Come to me on your own.

735
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:34,864
See what I can do.

736
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:37,087
There's still time, Sam.

737
00:47:37,293 --> 00:47:40,380
I can make things like they were.

738
00:47:40,797 --> 00:47:44,696
Or make things worse that
you won't know what hit you.

739
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:46,935
You have until 6 tomorrow.

740
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,167
Come to me on your own.

741
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:50,727
See what I can do.

742
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:52,487
Ma'am, turn your phone off.

743
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:53,487
This is ICU.

744
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:55,767
I am really sorry.
I can make things like they were.

745
00:47:56,687 --> 00:48:00,207
Or make things worse that
you won't know what hit you.

746
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:02,967
You have until 6 tomorrow.

747
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:05,047
Come to me on your own.

748
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:07,584
See what I can do.

749
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:09,407
There's still time, Sam.

750
00:48:09,607 --> 00:48:11,447
I can make things like they were.

751
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:12,647
Sam. Is everything okay?

752
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,207
Sorry. I am really sorry.

753
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:16,087
This thing won't stop.

754
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:17,183
Very sorry.

755
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:19,207
You have until 6 tomorrow.
- Just shut up.

756
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:23,327
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

757
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:25,737
Just shut up.

758
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:27,727
Just shut up.

759
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:33,647
Just shut up.

760
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,367
Sam.

761
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,809
Sam.

762
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:08,212
It's all over.

763
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:16,487
It's over.

764
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:22,567
It's all over.

765
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:29,207
It's over.

766
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:30,728
Finished!

767
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,172
Finished!

768
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:47,327
You can try to make her sleep.

769
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:50,687
I'll keep waking her up.

770
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:56,487
Your car keys.

771
00:49:57,087 --> 00:49:58,127
The guard gave them to me.

772
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:04,061
He said last night you weren't even in
a condition to walk home on your own.

773
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,847
What is this, Sam?

774
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:18,161
You've been through so much

775
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:20,051
and you didn't think
it was important to tell me?

776
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:24,754
Isn't our relationship strong
enough to share each other's pain?

777
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:26,367
Tell you what, Om?

778
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:28,887
And when?

779
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:33,208
I would tell you if you
take some time off your stardom.

780
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:34,607
Sam, I am here now.

781
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:36,687
And I want to know.

782
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,287
Believe me,
Om, you don't want to know.

783
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,622
Believe me, Sam, I do want to know.

784
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,687
This would've never happened
if I hadn't fallen weak that night.

785
00:50:53,727 --> 00:50:56,127
Vivek has confused
my mistake for love.

786
00:50:57,527 --> 00:50:59,687
And now he's angry at being rejected.

787
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:08,327
Om.

788
00:51:16,727 --> 00:51:21,207
Sam, this is all my fault,
and not yours.

789
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:25,607
I've not complaints,
just angry with myself.

790
00:51:25,825 --> 00:51:27,727
I am responsible for
everything that happened?

791
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:31,363
If I hadn't left you alone,

792
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:32,847
you wouldn't have felt alone, and

793
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:36,047
I am so sorry Sam,
that I wasn't there.

794
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:41,727
But I've realised my mistake.

795
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:43,447
And I am going to make it right.

796
00:51:45,327 --> 00:51:47,967
I'll be leaving for an outdoor
shoot in a couple of days.

797
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:49,567
Come with me.

798
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,807
We'll go out of Mumbai
for a couple of days.

799
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:54,767
And it will be easier
for you to forget this episode.

800
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:56,447
No

801
00:51:56,647 --> 00:52:00,767
This Vivek.
He's given me a 6 o'clock deadline.

802
00:52:00,847 --> 00:52:02,287
I've to handle him as well.

803
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:04,407
I wonder what he's going to do next?

804
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:05,687
Vivek!

805
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:08,247
That little sh**

806
00:52:08,805 --> 00:52:10,840
I am Om Kapoor, the star.

807
00:52:10,991 --> 00:52:13,567
I'll call the Commissioner,
and he'll be behind bars.

808
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,527
Still, Om, understand.

809
00:52:15,887 --> 00:52:16,607
I think I should stay.

810
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:19,727
It's all so confusing.
- Sam  Sam  Please

811
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:22,127
For my sake.

812
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:24,607
You know how important you are to me.

813
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,727
Sam, without you there's nothing.

814
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:52,167
"I am like the summer days "

815
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:56,843
" burning all day for you."

816
00:52:56,903 --> 00:53:01,767
"You're like the winter evenings "

817
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:06,167
" I am the one that completes you."

818
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:09,007
"I am the wound,

819
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:11,247
and you're the cure."

820
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:15,267
"Give me relief."

821
00:53:15,327 --> 00:53:18,527
"Since I found you,

822
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:22,367
"I found my support."

823
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:25,527
"Like the shore"

824
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:29,167
"to the wandering tide."

825
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:32,963
"I found in you "

826
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,606
"I found in you "

827
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:06,119
"Without you,
I looked so incomplete in life."

828
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:15,141
"But being with you made me complete."

829
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:24,736
"What I am, it's all thanks to you."

830
00:54:25,127 --> 00:54:28,447
"Because of your ability to find God"

831
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:31,247
"even in inanimate objects."

832
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:36,367
"I am not human,
nor do I have an identity."

833
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:40,447
"I've been nameless forever."

834
00:54:41,287 --> 00:54:45,887
"Wandering around like a nomad "

835
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:50,407
" be my asylum."

836
00:54:50,847 --> 00:54:55,607
"I am the wound,
and you're the cure."

837
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:59,387
"Give me relief."

838
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:02,527
"Since I found you,"

839
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:06,327
"I found my support."

840
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:13,407
"Like the shore
to the wandering tide."

841
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:17,007
"Since I found you"

842
00:55:17,087 --> 00:55:20,698
"I found my support."
- Sh***

843
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,407
Sir sir

844
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,647
Sir, do you want to divorce your wife?

845
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:27,567
Please

846
00:55:27,847 --> 00:55:29,727
No no comments.

847
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:30,607
Om

848
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,087
No

849
00:55:33,007 --> 00:55:33,607
Sir

850
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:35,687
No comments, please.

851
00:55:36,687 --> 00:55:37,647
Excuse me.

852
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,087
Please excuse me.

853
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:42,207
Let me go, please.

854
00:55:44,527 --> 00:55:45,487
Om.

855
00:55:46,207 --> 00:55:47,247
Om listen.

856
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:48,647
Please, sir

857
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:52,267
Please, sir

858
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:09,727
All these are just rumours.

859
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,127
In fact, I am not even sure what people
get from spreading such rumours.

860
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,847
Sameera Khanna and I are
just good friends, that's all.

861
00:56:20,887 --> 00:56:23,647
I was returning from a
shoot and met her on the flight.

862
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,447
So as a friend in need
I was trying to support her.

863
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:28,047
That's the truth.

864
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:33,687
I love my wife very much.

865
00:56:34,087 --> 00:56:37,453
And no, we're not
going to get a divorce.

866
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,287
Amazing.

867
00:56:45,807 --> 00:56:49,207
Auntie's in serious condition,
and you went to Goa.

868
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,127
What the hell are you doing here?

869
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:53,847
Auntie is resting.

870
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:55,767
How dare you come here?

871
00:56:59,727 --> 00:57:02,320
You still doubt my courage.

872
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:06,247
Or do you think I am a coward
like the rest of the men in your life?

873
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,927
See how Om ran off with
his tail between his legs

874
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:12,487
You want to marry him, don't you?

875
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:14,287
He's a celebrity.

876
00:57:14,727 --> 00:57:17,567
He won't marry you unless
the media isn't around.

877
00:57:17,627 --> 00:57:19,567
You'll be waiting for
him alone at the wedding aisle.

878
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:26,047
But I can marry you if you want.

879
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:26,807
Get out.

880
00:57:26,887 --> 00:57:29,567
Get out from here before I
call the security and throw you out!

881
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:30,687
Why don't you understand?

882
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:32,927
Don't you realise what I can do?

883
00:57:33,303 --> 00:57:34,607
Shall I hack into
the hospital's system?

884
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:36,785
And then auntie
- Don't you dare?

885
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:38,247
Don't you dare?

886
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:42,047
If you don't leave
- Or else what?

887
00:57:43,687 --> 00:57:47,759
Listen carefully,
I wanted you to come to me willingly.

888
00:57:49,127 --> 00:57:50,167
But now

889
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:53,847
you'll pay for not listening to me.

890
00:57:54,247 --> 00:57:58,134
Your hot photos with Om are
already trending on the internet.

891
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:00,834
Your life is screwed.

892
00:58:01,807 --> 00:58:02,687
So

893
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:06,567
the consequences of
breaking a hacker's heart.

894
00:58:08,324 --> 00:58:11,487
Your life is hacked, Sameer Khanna.

895
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:14,167
And you can't escape me.

896
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:18,237
You can't take over my life by
hacking me on the internet me, Vivek.

897
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:21,927
I will take my life back from you.

898
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:23,687
I promise.

899
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:25,167
That's the problem, Sam.

900
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:31,529
Life these days is on the internet.

901
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:36,007
You cannot take your
life back even if you want to.

902
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:38,447
You can try all you want.

903
00:58:39,127 --> 00:58:40,207
I said

904
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:43,087
I will take my life back from you.

905
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:45,927
We shall see.

906
00:59:42,132 --> 00:59:43,292
What is your name?

907
00:59:44,892 --> 00:59:45,692
Sam.

908
00:59:53,052 --> 00:59:53,972
Full name.

909
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,371
Sameera Khanna.

910
01:00:17,412 --> 01:00:20,332
Why doesn't your hair
smell like Sam's hair?

911
01:00:22,492 --> 01:00:24,972
I told you to be completely like Sam.

912
01:00:26,612 --> 01:00:28,332
I tried.

913
01:00:40,612 --> 01:00:42,332
The softness of your skin

914
01:00:45,732 --> 01:00:47,252
You can never be Sam.

915
01:00:50,132 --> 01:00:50,812
Leave me.

916
01:00:50,892 --> 01:00:52,492
You can never be Sam.

917
01:00:52,892 --> 01:00:54,612
You can never be Sam.

918
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:55,492
Leave me.

919
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:56,692
Leave me.

920
01:00:56,772 --> 01:00:58,172
No one can be!

921
01:01:02,972 --> 01:01:04,292
Run!

922
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:08,332
Get out!

923
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:44,332
Sam.

924
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:48,252
You took a rickshaw today.

925
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:49,652
What happened to your car?

926
01:01:49,732 --> 01:01:51,492
I was facing parking
problems every day.

927
01:01:52,132 --> 01:01:53,172
So I sold it.

928
01:01:53,772 --> 01:01:54,412
Sold it?

929
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:56,932
Are you okay?

930
01:01:57,052 --> 01:01:57,852
I am fine.

931
01:01:59,212 --> 01:02:00,572
But I've made up my mind

932
01:02:01,212 --> 01:02:04,172
if anything begins to weigh me down,

933
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:05,812
better to get rid of it.

934
01:02:43,532 --> 01:02:44,812
She is in peace now.

935
01:02:45,572 --> 01:02:49,652
I know it's not easy to
let your mother go like this.

936
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:51,732
You're a brave girl, Sam.

937
01:02:52,372 --> 01:02:53,612
I am proud of you.

938
01:02:55,532 --> 01:02:58,092
I just hope it's not
too late to be brave.

939
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:50,920
I am sorry for your loss, Sam.

940
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:55,494
But I want you to know
that I am here for you.

941
01:03:57,692 --> 01:03:59,033
And what you did

942
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:01,412
was necessary.

943
01:04:02,412 --> 01:04:04,532
In fact,
I wanted to suggest this myself

944
01:04:04,612 --> 01:04:06,252
but, never could muster the courage.

945
01:04:06,332 --> 01:04:09,092
You've always had
a lack of courage, Om.

946
01:04:10,372 --> 01:04:12,692
Sam, come on. Are you still angry?

947
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:19,492
There are two bodies
burning in that pyre.

948
01:04:21,252 --> 01:04:24,534
One that you see,
belongs to my mother.

949
01:04:26,092 --> 01:04:30,471
And the one you don't
see is the old Sam.

950
01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:35,772
My friend said I always
ignore my problems.

951
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:36,972
He was right.

952
01:04:38,986 --> 01:04:41,772
But the time has come
to face my problems.

953
01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:46,092
If I ever see you again

954
01:04:47,932 --> 01:04:51,658
Trying to be a friend,
love, or a star

955
01:04:52,652 --> 01:04:54,692
then you've no idea
what I'll do to you.

956
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,612
Get the fu** out of
my sight and out of my life.

957
01:05:16,852 --> 01:05:17,692
Bravo.

958
01:05:18,772 --> 01:05:22,725
It's high time you realise Sam,
what an as***ole he is.

959
01:05:36,652 --> 01:05:37,052
Yes?

960
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:38,012
Does Vivek live here?

961
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:40,252
Yes. But

962
01:05:40,332 --> 01:05:42,041
Call him.

963
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:43,225
Call him.

964
01:05:43,492 --> 01:05:44,332
What did Vivek do?

965
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:46,052
We'll discuss that later.
First, call him.

966
01:05:50,252 --> 01:05:51,012
Are you Vivek?

967
01:05:51,812 --> 01:05:52,452
What happened?

968
01:05:52,572 --> 01:05:53,832
What happened?

969
01:05:53,892 --> 01:05:56,292
You look so naive,
but on the inside you're evil.

970
01:05:56,705 --> 01:05:58,292
Come on. check inside.

971
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:01,012
If there's a laptop or a phone inside,

972
01:06:01,092 --> 01:06:01,892
check it properly.

973
01:06:02,012 --> 01:06:05,132
This is not right
- Granny, don't interfere.

974
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:07,052
Don't interfere with the Law.

975
01:06:07,132 --> 01:06:07,652
Vivek.

976
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,534
Vivek, what have you done?

977
01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:13,247
He's going to go in for long.

978
01:06:17,904 --> 01:06:18,776
Sir.

979
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:29,092
Take a good look.

980
01:06:29,692 --> 01:06:30,452
Is that him?

981
01:06:35,652 --> 01:06:37,252
Fine, you may leave.

982
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,576
If he talks, I will update you.

983
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:44,812
Take him inside.

984
01:06:45,092 --> 01:06:45,932
Come on.

985
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:53,172
So

986
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:56,732
Are you the Superman
of the computer world?

987
01:06:57,212 --> 01:06:58,061
Hooker.

988
01:06:58,492 --> 01:06:59,252
Hooker?

989
01:07:00,212 --> 01:07:01,252
Hacker. Hacker.

990
01:07:02,412 --> 01:07:04,492
Why are you bothering Sameera madam?

991
01:07:05,474 --> 01:07:07,232
No I have done nothing.
- Hey.

992
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:08,772
You can't hit me.

993
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:09,852
Why not?

994
01:07:10,412 --> 01:07:11,492
You're 19, aren't you?

995
01:07:11,972 --> 01:07:14,692
If you can vote,
then you can also take a beating.

996
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:16,972
What?

997
01:07:17,572 --> 01:07:19,252
You're mistaken

998
01:07:19,412 --> 01:07:20,532
You're going to speak up.

999
01:07:20,692 --> 01:07:22,569
Because whoever comes here,

1000
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,092
He comes in intact

1001
01:07:24,372 --> 01:07:25,812
but goes out broken.

1002
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:26,772
Understand.

1003
01:07:26,852 --> 01:07:30,092
We've your laptop and your mobile.

1004
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:33,294
So you better speak
up before we find anything.

1005
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:38,652
Keep a watch on him.
- Okay, sir.

1006
01:07:38,732 --> 01:07:39,772
I'll be right back.

1007
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:05,612
Can I get some water?

1008
01:08:05,892 --> 01:08:06,932
Yes.

1009
01:08:46,612 --> 01:08:47,532
So

1010
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:50,332
what have you decided?

1011
01:08:51,412 --> 01:08:53,414
Will you speak up or take a beating?

1012
01:08:55,932 --> 01:09:03,364
The Malwa restaurant at
Chakala serves the best fish fry.

1013
01:09:05,052 --> 01:09:06,492
Absolutely delicious.

1014
01:09:06,692 --> 01:09:07,732
What?

1015
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:09,667
I am sure you know.

1016
01:09:10,092 --> 01:09:11,612
It's Surubhi's favourite.

1017
01:09:12,532 --> 01:09:14,051
You went there last Wednesday.

1018
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:16,612
Surabhi was insisting.

1019
01:09:17,972 --> 01:09:19,052
Makku

1020
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:20,972
Isn't that what she calls you?

1021
01:09:21,852 --> 01:09:23,100
So sweet.

1022
01:09:24,772 --> 01:09:25,892
Does sister-in-law know?

1023
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:28,932
Makku

1024
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:30,612
About Surabhi.

1025
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:40,313
Many years ago, Chanakya said

1026
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:44,822
Four things that a person
need to become powerful.

1027
01:09:46,052 --> 01:09:46,812
Convince

1028
01:09:47,012 --> 01:09:47,652
Bribe

1029
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:48,612
Punish

1030
01:09:48,692 --> 01:09:49,452
Secrets

1031
01:09:50,012 --> 01:09:51,932
You've the power to convince,
bribe, or punish.

1032
01:09:52,052 --> 01:09:55,532
but I control the secrets.

1033
01:09:56,172 --> 01:09:57,172
Hacker.

1034
01:09:58,332 --> 01:10:01,411
I've more such secrets that
You would want to keep to yourself.

1035
01:10:01,972 --> 01:10:05,279
Now apologise to sister-in-law.

1036
01:10:06,572 --> 01:10:07,612
And me too.

1037
01:10:15,692 --> 01:10:16,412
Yeah, inspector.

1038
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:19,812
Madam, you know what

1039
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:21,532
we let the kid go.

1040
01:10:22,812 --> 01:10:24,892
We didn't find any proof against him.

1041
01:10:25,052 --> 01:10:27,172
But you'll find proof
if you look for it.

1042
01:10:27,454 --> 01:10:29,892
Look, madam, please don't
make such rubbish complaints

1043
01:10:30,212 --> 01:10:31,740
and waste the Police's time.

1044
01:10:32,252 --> 01:10:32,972
Okay.

1045
01:10:33,652 --> 01:10:34,372
Hello.

1046
01:10:34,852 --> 01:10:35,732
Hello.

1047
01:10:45,932 --> 01:10:47,812
He isn't taking any
action against him, is he?

1048
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:49,812
Right?

1049
01:10:51,092 --> 01:10:55,172
I don't know how Vivek managed
to overpower that Inspector.

1050
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:56,212
He was scared.

1051
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:58,072
I don't understand how
the hell is he doing this.

1052
01:10:58,132 --> 01:10:59,012
I don't

1053
01:11:02,172 --> 01:11:03,132
Yeah, Anuj.

1054
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:05,732
Sam, you didn't have to do this.

1055
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:08,228
I told you I'll find
something for you.

1056
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:10,532
It's not right to be so desperate.

1057
01:11:10,692 --> 01:11:11,572
Desperate

1058
01:11:11,852 --> 01:11:13,772
Wait  what are you talking about?

1059
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,332
I don't understand.

1060
01:11:15,732 --> 01:11:18,412
I am talking about
your post on Facebook.

1061
01:11:19,092 --> 01:11:20,252
Facebook  Me

1062
01:11:23,332 --> 01:11:25,732
Wait, let me just call you back, Anuj.

1063
01:11:27,852 --> 01:11:28,652
Facebook.

1064
01:11:28,732 --> 01:11:29,172
Yeah.

1065
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,212
He's posted a picture
on your Facebook page.

1066
01:11:40,372 --> 01:11:42,012
I sold my car today.

1067
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:44,692
I lost my job a couple of days ago.

1068
01:11:44,892 --> 01:11:46,892
I've been having a streak
of bad luck recently.

1069
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:48,971
My company fired me,

1070
01:11:49,252 --> 01:11:52,252
my boyfriend Om publicly
denied our relationship.

1071
01:11:53,132 --> 01:11:54,732
And my mom passed away.

1072
01:11:55,212 --> 01:11:56,652
I am very depressed

1073
01:11:57,789 --> 01:12:00,812
and request my
friends to help me out.

1074
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:02,292
Oh my, God.

1075
01:12:03,372 --> 01:12:04,532
I can't even delete this post.

1076
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,412
I think your Facebook
account is hacked.

1077
01:12:07,052 --> 01:12:08,853
He's hacked my Insta-frame too.

1078
01:12:10,052 --> 01:12:12,452
And posted the same
picture with the same post.

1079
01:12:26,212 --> 01:12:27,892
It's on Twitter as well.

1080
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:30,332
God.

1081
01:12:31,892 --> 01:12:33,532
Everyone will think it's me.

1082
01:12:33,612 --> 01:12:34,692
I am doing this.

1083
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,932
This bas*** can't get away like this.

1084
01:12:37,612 --> 01:12:39,292
He will have to fix
everything he's done.

1085
01:12:39,532 --> 01:12:41,412
And I'll make him pay for him.

1086
01:12:41,532 --> 01:12:44,187
Now tell me, what happened?

1087
01:12:45,892 --> 01:12:47,412
Why did the Police arrest you?

1088
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,532
It's nothing.

1089
01:12:49,972 --> 01:12:51,492
Tell me what you're up to.

1090
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:53,652
You must have done something.

1091
01:12:56,821 --> 01:12:57,612
Look,

1092
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,012
I will tell your dad everything.

1093
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:03,117
He can't handle so much stress.

1094
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,332
It was just a misunderstanding.

1095
01:13:06,452 --> 01:13:08,492
They mistook me for some other Vivek.

1096
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:13,172
You know what,
send all your documents to your dad.

1097
01:13:13,452 --> 01:13:15,612
And start a better life in the US.

1098
01:13:17,612 --> 01:13:18,692
Are you listening?

1099
01:13:19,332 --> 01:13:20,065
Relax.

1100
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,532
How can I relax?

1101
01:13:28,212 --> 01:13:28,812
Vivek.

1102
01:13:28,892 --> 01:13:29,812
Who
- Vivek.

1103
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:35,372
Where are the passwords
for Sam's accounts?

1104
01:13:35,492 --> 01:13:37,412
Where are the passwords
for Sam's social media accounts?

1105
01:13:37,692 --> 01:13:39,212
Where are the passwords
for Sam's accounts?

1106
01:13:39,452 --> 01:13:40,572
Give me the passwords.

1107
01:13:40,812 --> 01:13:42,132
You won't listen, will you?

1108
01:13:43,172 --> 01:13:45,292
You like destroying others life,
don't you?

1109
01:13:46,252 --> 01:13:47,772
I will set you straight.

1110
01:13:48,452 --> 01:13:49,332
Stop!

1111
01:13:49,372 --> 01:13:50,852
Stop it! Stop it!

1112
01:13:50,972 --> 01:13:52,092
Leave me.
- Rohan, stop it.

1113
01:13:52,172 --> 01:13:53,052
Give me the passwords.

1114
01:13:53,212 --> 01:13:54,932
What account? What password?
- Where are the passwords?

1115
01:13:55,972 --> 01:13:56,692
Rohan, leave him.

1116
01:13:56,972 --> 01:13:58,212
Leave me. Give me the passwords.
- Stop it! Stop it!

1117
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,492
Rohan, stop it. Please stop it, guys.

1118
01:14:00,656 --> 01:14:03,712
Just stop it Rohan. Stop. Please stop.
- Give me the password.

1119
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,452
Where are the passwords
for Sam's accounts?

1120
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,052
Where are the passwords
for Sam's accounts?

1121
01:14:07,132 --> 01:14:08,172
Rohan, leave him.

1122
01:14:08,252 --> 01:14:09,132
I said leave him.

1123
01:14:10,932 --> 01:14:11,892
Where are the passwords?

1124
01:14:14,172 --> 01:14:15,172
Sorry, bro.

1125
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:18,972
What is all this, Vivek?

1126
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:21,012
What have you done?

1127
01:14:21,692 --> 01:14:24,621
First the Police, and now Rohan.

1128
01:14:25,572 --> 01:14:27,732
He's the most innocent
boy in this society.

1129
01:14:27,932 --> 01:14:28,692
What have you done?

1130
01:14:28,772 --> 01:14:30,172
Tell me honestly.
- It's nothing.

1131
01:14:30,252 --> 01:14:31,212
Just a little society drama.

1132
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:32,172
Don't stress yourself.

1133
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:33,732
I see

1134
01:14:34,372 --> 01:14:36,212
Even I know this is not drama.

1135
01:14:36,532 --> 01:14:38,212
I am old but not stupid.

1136
01:14:38,412 --> 01:14:39,292
What did you do?

1137
01:14:40,372 --> 01:14:40,969
It's nothing.

1138
01:14:41,092 --> 01:14:42,012
Tell me.

1139
01:14:50,582 --> 01:14:51,702
Thank God.

1140
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:53,662
Rohan, why did you have to go there?

1141
01:14:54,262 --> 01:14:56,182
Why should we let him know that
all this is making a difference to us?

1142
01:14:56,422 --> 01:14:57,942
But, Sam, your condition.

1143
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:00,022
I couldn't see you like that.

1144
01:15:00,982 --> 01:15:02,822
This bloody guy, how could he do this?

1145
01:15:02,942 --> 01:15:03,702
Okay,

1146
01:15:04,262 --> 01:15:05,182
where's the first aid kit?

1147
01:15:06,422 --> 01:15:07,622
I think it's in the cabinet.

1148
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:08,742
I'll get it.

1149
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:38,862
Rohan.

1150
01:15:40,622 --> 01:15:42,142
Why didn't you tell me?

1151
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:48,022
What could I say, Sam?

1152
01:15:49,422 --> 01:15:52,422
Your friend who studied with you

1153
01:15:54,576 --> 01:15:56,601
is still failing every exam in life.

1154
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:01,422
Sam, you're living a life of success,

1155
01:16:01,462 --> 01:16:02,302
and

1156
01:16:03,512 --> 01:16:06,502
I could never muster the courage
to stand next to you.

1157
01:16:09,502 --> 01:16:10,862
Maybe that's why

1158
01:16:12,622 --> 01:16:14,253
I never could tell you.

1159
01:16:22,102 --> 01:16:23,502
Take a good look at me.

1160
01:16:25,022 --> 01:16:27,582
Do I look successful to you?

1161
01:16:27,782 --> 01:16:28,302
Just look at me.

1162
01:16:28,382 --> 01:16:29,262
After everything that happened to me,

1163
01:16:29,342 --> 01:16:30,862
you think I am successful.

1164
01:16:31,022 --> 01:16:32,862
I am a lonely, shattered girl.

1165
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:34,302
Nothing more.

1166
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:35,822
You're not alone, Sam.

1167
01:16:37,062 --> 01:16:38,142
I am with you.

1168
01:16:39,142 --> 01:16:41,822
But the fact is even I am shattered.

1169
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:47,902
But your shattered friend
won't let you shatter anymore.

1170
01:17:00,342 --> 01:17:06,152
"O Dawn don't peek
from the clouds yet."

1171
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:12,721
"The night wants to stay
to know our advice."

1172
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:18,622
"O Dawn don't peek
from the clouds yet."

1173
01:17:19,382 --> 01:17:25,062
"The night wants to stay
to know our advice."

1174
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:28,862
"Tell the clouds I am floor "

1175
01:17:28,942 --> 01:17:31,702
" I am all yours,

1176
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:37,842
without having to say anything."

1177
01:17:37,902 --> 01:17:38,862
Sorry.

1178
01:17:39,942 --> 01:17:46,064
"You're safe in my arms forever."

1179
01:17:46,342 --> 01:17:52,375
"I'll follow in the
path you'll tread on."

1180
01:17:52,742 --> 01:17:59,057
"You're safe in my arms forever."

1181
01:17:59,182 --> 01:18:05,383
"I'll follow in the
path you'll tread on."

1182
01:18:19,582 --> 01:18:21,222
Hi.
- Hi

1183
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:23,662
I can't sleep peacefully
in my own house today, Rohan.

1184
01:18:25,222 --> 01:18:28,582
He's keeping an eye on
me every minute, everywhere.

1185
01:18:30,102 --> 01:18:32,142
I feel like a damn goldfish in a bowl.

1186
01:18:32,302 --> 01:18:33,022
Don't worry, Sam.

1187
01:18:33,782 --> 01:18:34,982
This goldfish has a way out.

1188
01:18:35,022 --> 01:18:41,125
"I am sad that you don't need me."

1189
01:18:41,462 --> 01:18:47,383
"But I pray that we'll meet again."

1190
01:18:47,742 --> 01:18:53,855
"You're my story, my asylum."

1191
01:18:54,062 --> 01:19:00,242
"You're my excuse for a life."

1192
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,462
Thank you.

1193
01:19:01,902 --> 01:19:08,322
"You're safe in my arms forever."

1194
01:19:08,382 --> 01:19:14,529
"I'll follow in the
path you'll tread on."

1195
01:19:14,658 --> 01:19:20,932
"You're safe in my arms forever."

1196
01:19:21,102 --> 01:19:27,676
"I'll follow in the
path you'll tread on."

1197
01:19:34,342 --> 01:19:35,262
Vinod Mehra.

1198
01:19:35,382 --> 01:19:36,942
After my favourite actor.

1199
01:19:37,142 --> 01:19:38,502
I became a cybersecurity expert.

1200
01:19:38,662 --> 01:19:40,942
Even in future if
you have any problem,

1201
01:19:41,102 --> 01:19:41,822
you will let me know.

1202
01:19:42,022 --> 01:19:42,542
Sure.

1203
01:19:42,702 --> 01:19:45,558
But I'll be really glad if
you can solve the problem at hand.

1204
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:46,422
Cool.

1205
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:48,862
So you believe he's
hacked all your accounts and

1206
01:19:48,902 --> 01:19:52,062
there are spy cams
and mics in your house.

1207
01:19:53,062 --> 01:19:53,662
Yeah.

1208
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:56,085
See, finding every mic
and spy cams isn't easy.

1209
01:19:56,244 --> 01:19:58,022
We'll have to un hack your laptop,
etcetera.

1210
01:19:58,222 --> 01:19:59,422
Will that solve our problem?

1211
01:20:01,302 --> 01:20:02,862
I want to go to the
root of the problem.

1212
01:20:03,142 --> 01:20:04,302
After that everything is easy.

1213
01:20:04,542 --> 01:20:05,222
Don't worry.

1214
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:07,582
Your problem will be solved in a snap.

1215
01:20:07,902 --> 01:20:08,782
Laptop.

1216
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:12,182
This is going to be a piece of cake.

1217
01:20:12,382 --> 01:20:16,657
First, we've to see which
root directory did he put the big in.

1218
01:20:23,702 --> 01:20:25,182
I envy your optimism.

1219
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:31,102
You really think this NCA graduate can
even lay a finger on this MIT topper.

1220
01:20:31,382 --> 01:20:34,222
By the way, he scored the
lowest marks in cybersecurity.

1221
01:20:34,422 --> 01:20:36,182
Ah-ha Wait just a minute.

1222
01:20:36,342 --> 01:20:37,702
I'll find out.

1223
01:20:37,822 --> 01:20:39,542
We'll see who's better.

1224
01:20:40,102 --> 01:20:43,139
Hey Cyber Expert, you have
an account in Model Bank, don't you?

1225
01:20:47,102 --> 01:20:49,213
Now leave quietly.

1226
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:52,662
Or else I'll find you
10,000 rupees every 10 minutes.

1227
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,622
Isn't that your visiting charges?

1228
01:21:00,862 --> 01:21:01,902
What the

1229
01:21:02,302 --> 01:21:03,582
He really did it.

1230
01:21:06,302 --> 01:21:07,102
Again.

1231
01:21:07,582 --> 01:21:08,822
You still have a chance, son.

1232
01:21:09,062 --> 01:21:10,062
Take my advice.

1233
01:21:10,222 --> 01:21:13,222
Because you don't have enough money
in your account to take a chance.

1234
01:21:14,314 --> 01:21:16,102
Oh, genius!

1235
01:21:18,281 --> 01:21:22,262
You really thought your problems will
be solved if you turn off the laptop.

1236
01:21:23,382 --> 01:21:24,262
Look

1237
01:21:24,502 --> 01:21:27,932
if the TV turns off,
I will empty your account.

1238
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:29,422
This guy's crazy.

1239
01:21:29,942 --> 01:21:31,382
He knows even more than I do.

1240
01:21:31,742 --> 01:21:32,342
I am sorry, guys.

1241
01:21:32,462 --> 01:21:33,302
Vinod, you need to help us out.

1242
01:21:33,382 --> 01:21:34,822
Vinod, we need your help

1243
01:21:35,582 --> 01:21:37,182
I am sorry, you need someone else.

1244
01:21:37,382 --> 01:21:38,502
Vinod.

1245
01:21:42,742 --> 01:21:44,022
I told you, Sam.

1246
01:21:45,062 --> 01:21:46,942
You won't find anyone better than me.

1247
01:21:48,102 --> 01:21:51,648
I kept telling you
but you don't wise up.

1248
01:21:52,302 --> 01:21:55,022
I can destroy your
entire life if I want

1249
01:21:55,102 --> 01:21:56,702
and I can do it for good.

1250
01:21:57,822 --> 01:22:00,062
Even if you run away,
or move to a different city,

1251
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:01,782
or even change your identity.

1252
01:22:01,862 --> 01:22:03,422
Or even erase your past.

1253
01:22:03,862 --> 01:22:06,982
But I will always find
you and bring you this crossroad.

1254
01:22:07,742 --> 01:22:09,542
You've no idea about my powers.

1255
01:22:09,942 --> 01:22:10,902
I am a hacker.

1256
01:22:11,022 --> 01:22:13,502
And a hacker can cripple
the government, and

1257
01:22:13,582 --> 01:22:14,062
Sam.

1258
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:15,622
you're just a helpless woman.

1259
01:22:15,782 --> 01:22:17,742
You can fu*** run from me,
- There is no place to hide, Rohan.

1260
01:22:17,822 --> 01:22:19,542
but you cannot hide.

1261
01:22:20,022 --> 01:22:21,222
There is no place to hide.

1262
01:22:21,382 --> 01:22:22,982
I can't take this anymore.
- Sam. Sam.

1263
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:24,522
Sam, wait.

1264
01:22:24,582 --> 01:22:25,862
Sam.

1265
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:27,662
Sam.

1266
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:28,782
Sam.

1267
01:22:34,507 --> 01:22:35,721
No

1268
01:22:39,862 --> 01:22:40,622
There's no way to run!

1269
01:22:41,182 --> 01:22:42,182
There's no way to run!

1270
01:22:54,262 --> 01:22:55,862
There is no place to hide.

1271
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:23,672
There is no place to hide.

1272
01:23:23,902 --> 01:23:25,302
There is no place to hide.

1273
01:23:25,582 --> 01:23:26,797
There is no place to hide.

1274
01:23:27,222 --> 01:23:28,462
There is no place to hide.

1275
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:29,862
There is no place to hide.

1276
01:23:32,038 --> 01:23:33,290
There is no place to hide.

1277
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:34,462
There is no place to hide.

1278
01:23:34,782 --> 01:23:35,982
There is no place to hide.

1279
01:23:45,742 --> 01:23:47,102
There is no place to hide.

1280
01:23:51,862 --> 01:23:52,962
That's right.

1281
01:23:53,022 --> 01:23:54,262
There is no place to hide.

1282
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:56,702
Do you like to complicate everything?

1283
01:23:56,862 --> 01:23:59,022
Things can be smooth.
But no.

1284
01:23:59,302 --> 01:24:00,102
Go ahead and ruin it.

1285
01:24:00,222 --> 01:24:03,245
I've been telling
you just do as I said.

1286
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:05,062
But no you just
complicated everything.

1287
01:24:05,142 --> 01:24:06,902
Look at your condition.

1288
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:09,302
Your reputation is in tatters.

1289
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:11,622
No one wants to make
you their girlfriend anymore.

1290
01:24:13,142 --> 01:24:18,237
You steal your boss's information,
and also someone's husband.

1291
01:24:18,297 --> 01:24:23,342
And you put your
reputation on social media.

1292
01:24:25,022 --> 01:24:28,782
I mean there was a point
in time when I wanted to marry you.

1293
01:24:29,182 --> 01:24:31,702
But now I won't even
make you my girlfriend.

1294
01:24:32,182 --> 01:24:34,938
And that's why I have decided,

1295
01:24:35,142 --> 01:24:36,702
I will use you.

1296
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:38,902
For sex.

1297
01:24:40,582 --> 01:24:42,142
Like Om does.

1298
01:24:43,222 --> 01:24:45,142
I will fu** you.

1299
01:24:46,435 --> 01:24:47,742
And here's the deal.

1300
01:24:48,262 --> 01:24:55,863
Until you don't call me up,
I will keep hacking your life.

1301
01:24:56,102 --> 01:24:58,225
And trust me, you don't want that.

1302
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:04,498
Spend nights with Vivek,
for peace and happiness.

1303
01:25:08,161 --> 01:25:09,284
Goodnight.

1304
01:25:48,822 --> 01:25:50,222
Royal Bar?

1305
01:26:30,413 --> 01:26:31,582
F***

1306
01:26:31,782 --> 01:26:33,702
Even if Vivek can see us here,
he can't hear us.

1307
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:34,742
We're safe here.

1308
01:26:34,883 --> 01:26:36,702
Thank you for bringing me here, Rohan.

1309
01:26:38,622 --> 01:26:41,222
But I didn't want to come
here to escape from Vivek.

1310
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:45,170
I wanted to come so I
can turn the tables on him.

1311
01:26:46,422 --> 01:26:46,942
What?

1312
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:48,062
What's on your mind?

1313
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:50,829
Like Vivek said there's
no place to hide.

1314
01:26:51,302 --> 01:26:52,182
He was right.

1315
01:26:53,982 --> 01:26:56,334
He made one thing pretty clear.

1316
01:26:57,502 --> 01:27:00,293
We bury our secrets on the internet

1317
01:27:02,554 --> 01:27:07,220
and scoundrels like Vivek
find them and blackmail us.

1318
01:27:08,462 --> 01:27:10,482
But I have no more secrets.

1319
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,422
Now it's Vivek's turn.

1320
01:27:12,862 --> 01:27:16,262
You mean we'll find Vivek's
secrets now and use it against him.

1321
01:27:16,382 --> 01:27:17,502
Exactly.

1322
01:27:18,302 --> 01:27:21,496
Vivek is a sociopath. He's a criminal.

1323
01:27:22,626 --> 01:27:26,342
And every criminal's
crime is hidden somewhere.

1324
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,426
We just have to find
the record of that crime.

1325
01:28:37,022 --> 01:28:39,542
Sam, these are the photos
I showed you at the club.

1326
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:41,782
But what are you trying
to see in these photos?

1327
01:28:41,862 --> 01:28:42,902
One second.

1328
01:28:45,502 --> 01:28:47,422
Yeah this one.

1329
01:28:48,142 --> 01:28:48,942
Sam, that's his maid's photo.

1330
01:28:49,022 --> 01:28:50,022
What are we going to do with that?

1331
01:28:52,262 --> 01:28:53,222
Look at this picture.

1332
01:28:53,302 --> 01:28:54,422
Look closer.

1333
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:57,942
If she's a maid, then how does she
have such an expensive designer bag?

1334
01:28:58,062 --> 01:28:59,382
It must be a fake, sam.

1335
01:28:59,462 --> 01:29:00,622
People buy duplicate stuff.

1336
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:01,542
You're forgetting.

1337
01:29:01,702 --> 01:29:03,302
I was the editor
of a fashion magazine.

1338
01:29:03,382 --> 01:29:05,022
I can tell real from the fake.

1339
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,222
This is an expensive designer back.

1340
01:29:07,302 --> 01:29:08,822
It must be worth a fortune.

1341
01:29:09,062 --> 01:29:10,542
And Vivek can't afford it.

1342
01:29:10,942 --> 01:29:12,262
And if she's a maid in his house

1343
01:29:12,342 --> 01:29:14,542
then how does she have
such an expensive handbag?

1344
01:29:35,782 --> 01:29:36,782
Woah

1345
01:29:36,982 --> 01:29:38,862
so you have an outing
with Rohan today.

1346
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,302
Nice.

1347
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,502
Out for a drive.

1348
01:30:20,942 --> 01:30:22,262
Rickshaw.

1349
01:30:23,483 --> 01:30:25,448
She is the one, Rohan.
She is there.

1350
01:30:25,662 --> 01:30:26,862
Central Mall.

1351
01:30:30,094 --> 01:30:31,020
Come on, let's go.

1352
01:30:53,982 --> 01:30:54,502
There she is.

1353
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:55,822
Come, come.

1354
01:31:02,302 --> 01:31:02,862
Where did she go?

1355
01:31:02,942 --> 01:31:04,102
She came to this store.

1356
01:31:17,502 --> 01:31:18,542
Sameera.

1357
01:31:23,982 --> 01:31:27,178
A few years ago Vivek came
to my store for an internship.

1358
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:29,590
He wanted to understand
the retail business.

1359
01:31:30,675 --> 01:31:33,002
In the beginning,
I thought he's a sweet kid.

1360
01:31:35,195 --> 01:31:37,955
Because I didn't know
the monster hiding inside him.

1361
01:31:39,685 --> 01:31:44,379
Soon I realised that he follows
me outside the store as well.

1362
01:31:44,955 --> 01:31:46,875
He also tried to flirt
with me a couple of times

1363
01:31:46,915 --> 01:31:49,235
but I clearly said no.

1364
01:31:50,075 --> 01:31:51,115
And you couldn't escape him.

1365
01:31:51,195 --> 01:31:51,835
Right.

1366
01:31:52,315 --> 01:31:54,475
Because he has some of my secrets,

1367
01:31:55,155 --> 01:31:56,115
which if becomes public

1368
01:31:56,195 --> 01:31:57,675
I will be ruined.

1369
01:31:58,235 --> 01:31:59,715
I am married, Sameera.

1370
01:32:00,355 --> 01:32:01,835
I also have two kids.

1371
01:32:02,195 --> 01:32:05,502
He has some of my photos
which if he leaks in the media,

1372
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:06,913
then I'll be finished.

1373
01:32:08,715 --> 01:32:10,515
And he knows that pretty well.

1374
01:32:12,475 --> 01:32:14,235
And that's why he
started to blackmail me.

1375
01:32:15,795 --> 01:32:18,835
He said if I don't work
in his house as a maid,

1376
01:32:19,955 --> 01:32:21,755
then he'll release the photos.

1377
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:26,235
Maid so that his granny
never grows suspicious about us.

1378
01:32:30,395 --> 01:32:32,395
So I just became his prostitute.

1379
01:32:33,075 --> 01:32:34,675
And then you came along,

1380
01:32:36,315 --> 01:32:37,835
and he became obsessed with you.

1381
01:32:37,995 --> 01:32:39,835
This kid is just 19.

1382
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:44,315
I don't understand how he
can be such a pervert at this age.

1383
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:47,035
Devil doesn't have an age, Rohan.

1384
01:32:49,865 --> 01:32:54,275
Rhea, he will pay for his crimes.

1385
01:32:54,675 --> 01:32:56,115
You're not the only one, Sameera.

1386
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:00,555
There have been others before us.

1387
01:33:09,075 --> 01:33:11,579
Vivek was after my
best friend Sheetal.

1388
01:33:11,995 --> 01:33:14,435
He proposed to Sheetal many times,

1389
01:33:14,715 --> 01:33:16,834
but she refused him every time.

1390
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:21,975
Vivek got so furious that
he decided to humiliate Sheetal.

1391
01:33:22,977 --> 01:33:24,055
He hacked Sheetal's phone,

1392
01:33:24,115 --> 01:33:25,655
laptop, etcetera.
- I am waiting.

1393
01:33:25,715 --> 01:33:29,093
Go on!
- Then he started to blackmail her.

1394
01:33:29,836 --> 01:33:33,151
He later leaked Sheetal's
nude photo on the internet.

1395
01:33:33,371 --> 01:33:37,714
Sheetal was so embarrassed by this,
that she committed suicide.

1396
01:33:38,025 --> 01:33:41,757
After that incident,
Vivek dropped out of college.

1397
01:33:48,675 --> 01:33:50,075
I promise you, Priya.

1398
01:33:51,355 --> 01:33:53,669
I'll win or die trying.

1399
01:34:00,115 --> 01:34:00,755
Thank you, Doc.

1400
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:02,235
Anytime, Sam.
Take care.

1401
01:34:02,275 --> 01:34:03,395
Bye.
- Bye.

1402
01:34:05,355 --> 01:34:06,355
Ralph's cafe.

1403
01:34:06,755 --> 01:34:08,955
After a really long time, my friend.

1404
01:34:20,168 --> 01:34:21,747
Remove sim card of your phone.

1405
01:34:22,555 --> 01:34:23,155
Why?

1406
01:34:23,315 --> 01:34:24,475
Just do it.
I'll tell you why?

1407
01:34:26,115 --> 01:34:28,795
But Sam, will it be safe to
discuss out in the open like this?

1408
01:34:29,835 --> 01:34:30,715
Wait.

1409
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:37,835
Wow

1410
01:34:38,915 --> 01:34:40,595
So smart, Sam.

1411
01:34:40,995 --> 01:34:44,206
But you're forgetting that
I set up the Wifi in the cafe.

1412
01:34:53,303 --> 01:34:54,767
I want one grilled sandwitch.

1413
01:34:54,896 --> 01:34:56,549
You want one?
- Yeah, w'll share.

1414
01:34:58,269 --> 01:35:01,106
The hall is very good.
- Yes. I am coming first time.

1415
01:35:07,115 --> 01:35:09,155
Without the phone, he can't hear us.

1416
01:35:09,235 --> 01:35:10,635
He can only see us.

1417
01:35:10,715 --> 01:35:12,875
And he won't know
anything about our plan.

1418
01:35:13,155 --> 01:35:14,595
But Sam, what is the plan?

1419
01:35:14,915 --> 01:35:19,355
I have a plan to get
Vivek off my back forever.

1420
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:21,900
We know everything about Sheetal.

1421
01:35:22,515 --> 01:35:23,915
Now we'll blackmail him.

1422
01:35:24,275 --> 01:35:25,503
But how will we do this?

1423
01:35:26,035 --> 01:35:27,675
We'll book a room in a hotel.

1424
01:35:28,035 --> 01:35:30,275
We'll bug it with cameras and mics

1425
01:35:30,515 --> 01:35:33,035
so we can see and hear Vivek clearly.

1426
01:35:33,675 --> 01:35:35,140
Then I will contact him.

1427
01:35:35,277 --> 01:35:37,355
And I'll tell him
that I accept his deal.

1428
01:35:37,595 --> 01:35:38,715
He's very smart.

1429
01:35:38,915 --> 01:35:39,795
Do you think he'll show up?

1430
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:40,715
He will.

1431
01:35:41,755 --> 01:35:43,155
Because I will call him.

1432
01:35:43,795 --> 01:35:45,215
This is what he wants after all.

1433
01:35:45,275 --> 01:35:46,595
Once he shows up

1434
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:50,674
we'll tell him that we know
that his maid is not really his maid.

1435
01:35:50,955 --> 01:35:52,875
And we also know what
he did with Sheetal.

1436
01:35:52,955 --> 01:35:55,651
So either he quietly confesses
or we'll tell everyone.

1437
01:35:56,275 --> 01:35:57,515
I'll make sure, Rohan.

1438
01:35:57,595 --> 01:36:00,595
I'll make sure that
he confesses everything.

1439
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:01,715
While you'll be in the parking.

1440
01:36:01,795 --> 01:36:03,595
Stay in the surveillance van,
watch him.

1441
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:06,607
As soon as I give you the signal,
you can come up and catch him.

1442
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:08,515
Okay.

1443
01:36:15,075 --> 01:36:16,035
Hey, Sam.

1444
01:36:18,704 --> 01:36:20,195
I accept your deal.

1445
01:36:20,355 --> 01:36:21,564
Good call baby doll.

1446
01:36:21,795 --> 01:36:23,875
But I will decide the place and time.

1447
01:36:24,475 --> 01:36:25,395
Done deal.

1448
01:36:40,235 --> 01:36:41,555
Where are you going?

1449
01:36:47,595 --> 01:36:50,155
Going out with some friends.

1450
01:36:51,355 --> 01:36:52,955
Your father called.

1451
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:56,315
He was asking about the documents.

1452
01:36:56,915 --> 01:36:57,995
I'll handle that.

1453
01:36:58,275 --> 01:36:59,235
How?

1454
01:37:03,515 --> 01:37:04,303
What do you mean?

1455
01:37:04,363 --> 01:37:07,265
When you weren't around I went to
your room to look for your documents?

1456
01:37:07,515 --> 01:37:10,675
Since I couldn't find them at home,
I asked around at the college.

1457
01:37:11,995 --> 01:37:14,547
I found out that you didn't
complete your graduation.

1458
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:16,635
And you're not doing your Masters

1459
01:37:17,515 --> 01:37:19,543
In fact,
you're repeating your last year.

1460
01:37:19,675 --> 01:37:22,213
So you've been lying
to us for all these months.

1461
01:37:22,715 --> 01:37:24,588
I cannot protect you anymore.

1462
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:29,235
Your dad will find out why you
dropped out of your previous college.

1463
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:33,619
Why did you have to be a detective?

1464
01:38:05,315 --> 01:38:06,355
Hi.

1465
01:38:34,835 --> 01:38:36,715
Hi, Vivek.

1466
01:38:39,515 --> 01:38:40,755
So what do you think?

1467
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:44,740
You won and I lost. Right?

1468
01:38:45,435 --> 01:38:48,595
And you can do whatever
you like with me.

1469
01:38:48,675 --> 01:38:50,551
You can have your way with me.

1470
01:38:51,195 --> 01:38:52,155
No.

1471
01:38:52,595 --> 01:38:53,395
You're wrong.

1472
01:38:54,275 --> 01:38:55,955
I have your secrets, Vivek.

1473
01:38:56,435 --> 01:38:58,987
Till now you used to
play with people's secrets.

1474
01:38:59,275 --> 01:39:01,459
Now I will play with you.

1475
01:39:16,595 --> 01:39:19,395
I know you bugged this
place with mics and cameras.

1476
01:39:19,475 --> 01:39:20,875
I am not stupid.

1477
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,515
Of course, I've bugged this place.

1478
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,795
I want to record your confession.

1479
01:39:25,915 --> 01:39:28,995
Sam, I know there are too
many cameras and mics in this room

1480
01:39:29,075 --> 01:39:30,075
which I will never find in time.

1481
01:39:30,275 --> 01:39:31,715
I am glad you know that.

1482
01:39:32,155 --> 01:39:35,359
That's why you will come with me,
out of this hotel.

1483
01:39:37,115 --> 01:39:40,315
Don't you see, Vivek? Your time is up.

1484
01:39:40,515 --> 01:39:42,231
You don't call the shots anymore.

1485
01:39:54,435 --> 01:39:55,475
Rohan!

1486
01:39:56,267 --> 01:39:57,355
What the

1487
01:39:58,075 --> 01:39:59,109
What did you do to him?

1488
01:39:59,169 --> 01:40:00,075
Vivek.

1489
01:40:00,835 --> 01:40:03,195
Your childhood friend
Rohan is dying inside the van.

1490
01:40:03,255 --> 01:40:04,722
I gave him a slow poison.

1491
01:40:04,866 --> 01:40:08,715
If he doesn't get the antidote
in four hours, then he will die.

1492
01:40:08,795 --> 01:40:09,635
My God

1493
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:11,395
How dare you

1494
01:40:11,675 --> 01:40:13,875
Of course,
you can take him to the hospital.

1495
01:40:13,955 --> 01:40:17,325
But they will need four hours
to find which poison he's been given.

1496
01:40:17,477 --> 01:40:20,395
And poor Rohan, dead, dead, dead

1497
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:23,875
You think you can take me
from here and no one will find out.

1498
01:40:23,955 --> 01:40:24,795
You are mistaken.

1499
01:40:24,955 --> 01:40:26,795
You're making a big mistake.

1500
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:28,955
You're wasting time, Sam.

1501
01:40:29,395 --> 01:40:31,275
Rohan has very little time left.

1502
01:40:32,675 --> 01:40:33,635
Vivek, listen to me...

1503
01:40:33,875 --> 01:40:38,395
Give me what I want, and I'll give you
this injection that can save Rohan.

1504
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:49,425
Hurry up, Sam. Tik-Tok-Tik

1505
01:40:59,035 --> 01:41:01,035
No one will disturb us here.

1506
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:06,267
There's no one here
except for you and me.

1507
01:41:09,995 --> 01:41:11,190
You know what I was thinking.

1508
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:12,395
That thing that's
been trending recently

1509
01:41:12,835 --> 01:41:13,795
#hashtagMeToo

1510
01:41:15,195 --> 01:41:17,195
I think I am a victim too.

1511
01:41:18,595 --> 01:41:24,035
How a high profile lady took advantage
of a 19-year-old innocent kid.

1512
01:41:24,395 --> 01:41:26,435
And threw him out of her life.

1513
01:41:26,675 --> 01:41:27,795
What do you think?

1514
01:41:29,155 --> 01:41:30,515
What are you looking at?

1515
01:41:32,355 --> 01:41:33,595
She is my granny.

1516
01:41:34,035 --> 01:41:35,195
She won't say anything.

1517
01:41:36,035 --> 01:41:37,195
She is dead.

1518
01:41:40,616 --> 01:41:42,115
I had to kill her.

1519
01:41:43,835 --> 01:41:44,635
What?

1520
01:41:44,695 --> 01:41:47,447
And I don't understand
why everyone has to do this.

1521
01:41:47,704 --> 01:41:50,814
Everyone I love they
fu*** turn against me.

1522
01:41:51,201 --> 01:41:53,515
First Rhea, then granny, and now you.

1523
01:41:53,715 --> 01:41:55,395
I've to take these violent steps.

1524
01:41:55,475 --> 01:41:58,835
Because I don't fu*** understand
what is wrong with everyone.

1525
01:42:00,475 --> 01:42:02,195
Do you think you won?

1526
01:42:02,675 --> 01:42:04,515
I called you at the hotel.

1527
01:42:05,155 --> 01:42:10,287
And the hotel's CCTV records show that
I was with you, and also left with you.

1528
01:42:10,742 --> 01:42:12,995
If they find my dead body,
then the Police won't spare you.

1529
01:42:13,075 --> 01:42:17,146
And if you leave me alive,
then I will tell you the Police.

1530
01:42:17,795 --> 01:42:19,515
I will get you arrested for rape.

1531
01:42:19,793 --> 01:42:22,275
Don't think that you've won.

1532
01:42:22,418 --> 01:42:24,435
I've yet to make my move, Vivek!

1533
01:42:28,595 --> 01:42:30,435
I've yet to make my move, Vivek!

1534
01:42:32,315 --> 01:42:33,755
How childish are you?

1535
01:42:34,155 --> 01:42:38,492
Watch how I turn your
backup plan into a flop show.

1536
01:42:38,635 --> 01:42:40,435
You cannot do anything.

1537
01:42:40,995 --> 01:42:43,315
My entry in the hotel's been recorded.

1538
01:42:43,395 --> 01:42:45,515
So is yours.

1539
01:42:45,595 --> 01:42:47,835
Even that we left together.

1540
01:42:47,955 --> 01:42:49,894
You cannot do anything, Vivek.

1541
01:42:52,435 --> 01:42:53,995
But I never came to the hotel.

1542
01:42:55,635 --> 01:42:57,995
And you never left the hotel.

1543
01:42:58,055 --> 01:42:59,235
What nonsense

1544
01:42:59,435 --> 01:43:01,035
What are you taking?

1545
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:04,355
Actually,
a magician never reveals his magic.

1546
01:43:05,218 --> 01:43:06,835
But you are special.

1547
01:43:07,675 --> 01:43:10,395
You're my VIP guest,
so I can make one exception.

1548
01:43:10,915 --> 01:43:13,438
Now watch how I erase
my digital footprints.

1549
01:43:14,115 --> 01:43:15,595
Everything is data package.

1550
01:43:15,675 --> 01:43:18,395
Replace one with another,
and you get what you want.

1551
01:43:18,835 --> 01:43:21,797
First, we've to erase
Vivek's CCTV footage.

1552
01:43:24,005 --> 01:43:26,675
Now, this is Hotel
Grand's CCTV footage.

1553
01:43:27,635 --> 01:43:29,635
And that's me entering.

1554
01:43:30,195 --> 01:43:33,515
I will replace this
data package with another.

1555
01:43:35,595 --> 01:43:36,915
And I disappear.

1556
01:43:40,355 --> 01:43:41,395
And look.

1557
01:43:42,435 --> 01:43:43,955
I am going towards your room.

1558
01:43:45,115 --> 01:43:46,795
And in the same way,

1559
01:43:48,235 --> 01:43:49,795
I've disappeared again.

1560
01:43:49,955 --> 01:43:51,115
Strange

1561
01:43:51,195 --> 01:43:52,635
I never came to the hotel.

1562
01:43:54,315 --> 01:43:55,835
You'll be caught.

1563
01:43:55,915 --> 01:43:57,555
Don't be foolish.

1564
01:43:57,915 --> 01:44:00,315
How can I get caught
if I was never there?

1565
01:44:01,315 --> 01:44:03,016
And now for you

1566
01:44:04,435 --> 01:44:05,955
You never left the hotel.

1567
01:44:10,395 --> 01:44:13,315
Let's watch your footage
entering the hotel.

1568
01:44:14,275 --> 01:44:15,115
Here you go.

1569
01:44:15,195 --> 01:44:16,635
7:30.

1570
01:44:20,955 --> 01:44:25,915
And that's our footage coming out.

1571
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:30,790
But since I was never there, so I

1572
01:44:31,835 --> 01:44:33,475
will erase myself.

1573
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:36,915
And woosh

1574
01:44:37,155 --> 01:44:38,355
Vivek's disappeared.

1575
01:44:38,515 --> 01:44:41,395
Now you're leaving the room alone.

1576
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:46,976
I'll change the time
stamp to 8:10 in the morning.

1577
01:44:49,475 --> 01:44:50,995
Hence proved

1578
01:44:51,355 --> 01:44:53,955
you entered the hotel
at 7:30 in the evening

1579
01:44:54,115 --> 01:44:58,508
and leave at 8:10
in the morning, alone.

1580
01:45:00,973 --> 01:45:03,515
I feel pity for people like you.

1581
01:45:04,355 --> 01:45:07,955
You don't even realise it and
your world changes before your eyes.

1582
01:45:12,115 --> 01:45:13,195
Remember?

1583
01:45:13,795 --> 01:45:14,915
Antidote.

1584
01:45:16,195 --> 01:45:17,635
This is the digital era.

1585
01:45:17,755 --> 01:45:19,475
The age of exhibitionism.

1586
01:45:20,915 --> 01:45:22,555
And that reminds me

1587
01:45:24,955 --> 01:45:30,275
I'll have to exhibit
how much I love you.

1588
01:46:02,118 --> 01:46:05,955
A monster like Vivek deserves death,
not punishment.

1589
01:46:06,475 --> 01:46:08,235
He needs to die, Priya.

1590
01:46:08,845 --> 01:46:10,195
And I'll do it.

1591
01:46:10,275 --> 01:46:11,523
I kept thinking

1592
01:46:12,129 --> 01:46:15,995
how can an ordinary girl
like me outwit a pro hacker like you.

1593
01:46:16,875 --> 01:46:20,595
And then I realised that
you can only hack computers.

1594
01:46:21,235 --> 01:46:25,555
For generations, girls like me had only
one weapon to defeat people like you.

1595
01:46:26,555 --> 01:46:29,915
We girls can hack your pervert mind.

1596
01:46:31,835 --> 01:46:33,915
And that's what I did with you.

1597
01:46:34,199 --> 01:46:36,315
Sam, even if we manage
to outwit Vivek,

1598
01:46:36,395 --> 01:46:37,435
we'll still have not won.

1599
01:46:37,595 --> 01:46:40,635
Remember you officially
lodged a complaint against him

1600
01:46:41,035 --> 01:46:42,195
that he was harassing you.

1601
01:46:42,275 --> 01:46:45,895
So if anything happens to Vivek,
then you'll go to jail for that.

1602
01:46:45,955 --> 01:46:46,875
You'll be the prime suspect.

1603
01:46:46,955 --> 01:46:51,075
Vivek keeps saying that only
someone better can defeat him.

1604
01:46:51,395 --> 01:46:53,933
So why don't we use him to kill him?

1605
01:46:55,845 --> 01:46:57,235
See

1606
01:46:57,435 --> 01:47:00,795
you proved that I am
in the hotel till morning.

1607
01:47:01,755 --> 01:47:04,395
That means I am not here.

1608
01:47:04,915 --> 01:47:09,026
And if I am not here,
then how can I kill you?

1609
01:47:09,835 --> 01:47:10,995
Vivek.

1610
01:47:19,035 --> 01:47:21,375
If we want to use Vivek against him

1611
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:23,875
then we must convince him that
he's still in control of the game.

1612
01:47:24,035 --> 01:47:25,755
Then let him control the game.

1613
01:47:25,995 --> 01:47:27,395
But how?
- Cafe.

1614
01:47:28,555 --> 01:47:31,515
I remember he fixed
the wifi of that place.

1615
01:47:32,115 --> 01:47:37,115
And if I go there Rohan, I am sure
he'll try to hear my conversation.

1616
01:47:47,115 --> 01:47:52,517
I told you, Vivek,
I will take my life back from you.

1617
01:47:53,315 --> 01:47:54,715
I am sorry, Vivek.

1618
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:59,595
But for doing that
I had to take your life.

1619
01:48:15,035 --> 01:48:16,620
Rohan.

1620
01:48:21,057 --> 01:48:23,158
So what happened on 12th August.

1621
01:48:26,135 --> 01:48:28,395
Actually,
officer, I was completely broken.

1622
01:48:29,715 --> 01:48:31,715
Tired of fighting

1623
01:48:32,315 --> 01:48:34,595
And finally called Vivek.

1624
01:48:35,515 --> 01:48:39,595
I told him that I'll wait for
him in room no. 204 of Hotel Strand.

1625
01:48:40,343 --> 01:48:41,755
Did she call Vivek?

1626
01:48:42,235 --> 01:48:43,315
Yes, sir.

1627
01:48:43,689 --> 01:48:48,856
According to Vivek's call logs,
Sameera called him at exactly 4:30

1628
01:48:50,979 --> 01:48:54,795
As far as I know, you and
Vivek live in the same society.

1629
01:48:55,432 --> 01:48:58,395
So why did you call Vivek
to meet at hotel Strand?

1630
01:48:58,555 --> 01:48:59,876
I didn't want to call him to my house

1631
01:48:59,936 --> 01:49:01,635
and ruin the purity of
my house, officer.

1632
01:49:02,235 --> 01:49:04,195
I've been embarrassed a lot.

1633
01:49:04,675 --> 01:49:06,475
I didn't want any more humiliation.

1634
01:49:07,035 --> 01:49:08,675
Other people stay
in that society as well.

1635
01:49:08,795 --> 01:49:12,490
They see they talk,
and I didn't want all that.

1636
01:49:15,555 --> 01:49:18,338
This is the CCTV
footage of hotel Strand

1637
01:49:18,835 --> 01:49:24,452
where you arrived at 7:30
and left at 8:10 in the morning.

1638
01:49:24,755 --> 01:49:25,835
Is that you?

1639
01:49:26,115 --> 01:49:27,342
Yes, that's me.

1640
01:49:27,402 --> 01:49:29,345
So that means you were
in the room all the time?

1641
01:49:30,115 --> 01:49:30,955
Yes

1642
01:49:31,115 --> 01:49:32,915
So who could've killed Vivek?

1643
01:49:32,995 --> 01:49:36,295
I mean who would want to kill Vivek.

1644
01:49:36,355 --> 01:49:38,875
Now that's your job to find out,
officer.

1645
01:49:39,915 --> 01:49:42,675
And as far as I know,
I am not his only victim.

1646
01:49:43,195 --> 01:49:45,435
He's harassed several other people.

1647
01:49:46,665 --> 01:49:48,273
Maybe one of them

1648
01:49:48,995 --> 01:49:50,315
You know what I mean.

1649
01:49:50,696 --> 01:49:53,355
My experience says that
she's committed the murder.

1650
01:49:54,572 --> 01:49:59,184
But sir, how can she
be in two places at one time?

1651
01:50:00,201 --> 01:50:01,955
That's impossible to prove.

1652
01:50:03,273 --> 01:50:07,831
If she was in her room,
then she can't be at the gas station.

1653
01:50:08,955 --> 01:50:12,947
However, she did do it,
and it's a bloody perfect crime.

1654
01:50:34,275 --> 01:50:36,275
So, what happened?

1655
01:50:37,075 --> 01:50:38,315
Case closed.

1656
01:50:38,395 --> 01:50:39,475
How

1657
01:50:41,715 --> 01:50:43,155
That's cool.

1658
01:50:44,435 --> 01:50:45,395
Shall we?

1659
01:50:47,715 --> 01:50:48,915
So now?

1660
01:50:49,195 --> 01:50:50,194
So now

1661
01:50:50,968 --> 01:50:52,595
Now, magazine editor,

1662
01:50:52,675 --> 01:50:55,865
Sam will start her own website
and enter the digital world.

1663
01:50:56,235 --> 01:50:58,275
Wow, that's a good idea.

1664
01:50:58,395 --> 01:50:59,435
It is.

1665
01:50:59,795 --> 01:51:01,475
And to celebrate we
should get some coffee.

1666
01:51:01,555 --> 01:51:04,075
No. I am done with coffee
for the rest of my life.

1667
01:51:04,155 --> 01:51:05,355
That's it.
