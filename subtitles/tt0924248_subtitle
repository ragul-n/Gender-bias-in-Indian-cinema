1
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,318
Sanjay!

2
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:37,690
Sanju!

3
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,823
Excuse me!

4
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,193
Where is our Sanju?

5
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:43,803
Found!

6
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,170
Sanjay is your son, isn't he?
Seetha Ramaiah!

7
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,903
Whom did you think then?

8
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,979
He is the only son for
my brother-in-law!

9
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,013
Very intelligent!

10
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,845
He does a great job
in Hyderabad.

11
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:00,883
Brother-in-law!

12
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,714
Would you get him married
atleast by this year or not?

13
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,455
Queen is required...

14
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,328
Finished!

15
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,230
What brother-in-law!

16
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,330
Did your son get married?

17
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,967
Not about marriage...
l finished my game!

18
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,961
You've given a good shock
brother-in-law...

19
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,366
...Else how would l know
about his marriage?

20
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,562
lt comes to my notice
when he comes and says,

21
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,765
''Daddy, l got married''.

22
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,410
You rock fun brother-in-law!

23
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:32,979
Can l have match box?

24
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:35,885
l am asking you...

25
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,812
Please give me your match box
for a while!

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
You are the son of our
Seetharam, aren't you?

27
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,956
Should l tell my address too
for the match box?

28
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,063
Do you know who l am?

29
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,831
l am your father's uncle!

30
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,093
Oh! Congratilations!
Match box?

31
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,930
You are repeating...

32
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,572
Will you ask me for match box
with no respect for elders?

33
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,430
Hey...

34
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,504
Are you kidding?

35
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,768
l am just your uncle!

36
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,171
He is your father's uncle!

37
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,205
Will you ask him for
the match box?

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,276
Tick him off so...

39
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,509
lt's okay my child...

40
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:04,913
What's in your hand?

41
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:05,948
lt's beer bottle, isn't it?

42
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,386
Yes, it is!
Yes, it is...

43
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,747
Guys like him were drinking,

44
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,320
l gathered to cast it away
into the drainage!

45
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,125
Hey...give me that Cigarette!
Do you have any bottles?

46
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,384
Uncle! You leave...

47
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,993
l look after this issue!

48
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,799
What shall l do for you?

49
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,128
Give me a match box...
that's enough!

50
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:24,701
Come on!

51
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,897
Where has my brother-in-law
been hidden?

52
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:34,178
the braid of a beautiful
Telugu Queen!

53
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,878
lt's not sufficient to
murmur brother-in-law

54
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,455
by decorating like this!

55
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,092
Reach him closely and
ask if he has coffee!

56
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:49,989
Mummy!

57
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,629
l have asked him for
10 times so far!

58
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:52,593
He said he did not want!

59
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,422
lf she still asks...

60
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,100
he thinks our sister has
started a Coffee hotel!

61
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:55,630
Shut your mouth!

62
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,393
lf he doesn't like Coffee...

63
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,128
Ask him if he has
butter milk!

64
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,206
lf he doesn't like butter milk,

65
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,431
Ask him if he wants Soup
or curry!

66
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,337
Hey...you first leave
the place...go!

67
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,036
Not like that...

68
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,677
My lovely daughter!

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,216
Walk close to him and
stroke him lovely!

70
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,147
Here is the comb!

71
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,479
l am dying...

72
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,849
He doesn't talk well!

73
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,422
l don't understand
what to talk!

74
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,217
Happy...

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,854
He has asked you just
for match box!

76
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,392
He asks me for Cigarette too!

77
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,199
Who is there?

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,765
Get some water for uncle!

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,859
Take the cards...

80
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,498
Brother-in-law!

81
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,432
Do you want butter milk?

82
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,405
Hey...No...No!

83
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,474
lt gets down...
What's that?

84
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,404
Butter milk and cold rice
are not required now!

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,674
Get lost!

86
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:45,316
Then...

87
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,017
This is...

88
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,418
Oh! ls this what you are
doing here?

89
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,955
Come on Dungu...Let's go!

90
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,618
Hey Sanjay...

91
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,954
My lovely dear!

92
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,131
Sanjay...

93
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,798
Manga...

94
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,962
Manga desires to have you!

95
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,206
Enjoy...taking her to
the coconut grove!

96
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,240
This sort of chances are
common during marriages!

97
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,242
This type of chances should
never be left!

98
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:16,671
Carry on...

99
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,851
...Try to Understand
why l am saying so!

100
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,018
Sanjay darling...

101
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,582
Are you marrying Venkatlakshmi

102
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,317
as you had enjoyed her
in some marriage?

103
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,927
Shit...Not at all!

104
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,991
Ours is a holy love!

105
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,158
What has impressed you
to love her?

106
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,566
Because my father-in-law's and
mine is a same caste!

107
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,668
...My father-in-law has
Rice mills in the city,

108
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,576
has Cinema Theatres!

109
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,947
has houses to use and vehicles
to give for hire!

110
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,140
After that...

111
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,421
His father-in-law has plates
to beg for alms!

112
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,894
You have calculated accurately
for your Love and Marriage!

113
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,324
Profits...Properties!

114
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,796
Those are the calculations
required to survive!

115
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,402
lf you nod your head for Manga,

116
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,909
The half of the property
of Senkam Uncle

117
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,839
will be yours!

118
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,935
But l can't tie marriage band
for Coconut groves

119
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,411
or Rice mills!

120
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,884
...Try to understand
why l am saying so!

121
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,352
Brother-in-law!

122
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,457
You?

123
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,724
l said l didn't want buttermilk
and coffee, didn't l?

124
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,293
Not for that...

125
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,930
l have come to give company!

126
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,158
l don't want Companies
and Factories!

127
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:45,728
Go and sleep!

128
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:50,041
''A young girl or boy should
not be alone''

129
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,267
My friend said!

130
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,641
Both together should not be
at a lonely place!

131
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,475
Do you know that?

132
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,981
Were you also told by
your friend?

133
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,487
His parents said!

134
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,223
lt's boring brother-in-law!

135
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,289
Shall we go to movie?

136
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,551
We still have half show left!

137
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,528
Why are you calm?

138
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,200
Don't you like to
come with me?

139
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,029
Yes l do!

140
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,298
Why for Cinema?

141
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,574
Even Lodge is okay!

142
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,667
But l confirm now...

143
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,739
Should not irritate for
marriage then!

144
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,345
Okay?

145
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,177
Manga Thasyaru!

146
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,286
Sanju...Sanju!
Sanju...get up!

147
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,193
What Uncle...

148
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,420
Early in the morning...

149
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,995
Cigarettes are on the
table if you want!

150
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,029
Stop Joking and get up!

151
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,495
Let's go...it's urgent!

152
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,497
Here is the tumbler!

153
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:50,498
You go away Dumbu!

154
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,035
Get up Sanju...get up!

155
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,899
What does he think
of my daughter?

156
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:54,697
She is fire!

157
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,999
That's why it was ignited!

158
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,732
His childishness!

159
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,003
He might have said casually!

160
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,308
lt is wrong!

161
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,339
Leave it Sister-in-law!

162
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,276
You have said well...

163
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,609
He can tell the same,
can't he?

164
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,512
l knew his character
and his behaviour,

165
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,380
while he had asked for
match box yesterday!

166
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,383
...Why do you raise the
match box issue again?

167
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:11,989
Ask for sorry to your
Aunt and Uncle...

168
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,055
Problem gets solved!

169
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:14,492
Sorry?

170
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,420
Why should l say sorry?

171
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,995
Had l approached her
and asked?

172
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,233
l don't know who had sent!

173
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,001
Since she approached me
and asked for 10 times,

174
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:25,727
l said so!

175
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,001
What did she ask you for?

176
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,501
Has she asked you to
come for Lodge?

177
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,801
Without taking me along?

178
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,309
As you are the son of
her maternal uncle,

179
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,140
she asked you casually
if you come for movie!

180
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,645
Should he tell this
if it was so?

181
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,383
...He had also said
as she is the daughter

182
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,448
of his maternal aunt!

183
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,710
Should you make it
such a scene?

184
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,148
End this quarell right now!

185
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:43,717
Let's go Sanjay!

186
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:44,951
Hey Gopalam!

187
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,649
Don't make fun...

188
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,224
Though he is closely related,

189
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,587
Will he ask my daughter
to come to Lodge?

190
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,092
You have said well...

191
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,855
l asked your daughter
to come to Lodge

192
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,124
...only once in the
presence of none!

193
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,794
But in the presence of all,

194
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,131
you are repeatedly using
the word Lodge...Lodge...

195
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,572
Who is insulting your
daughter?

196
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,263
you or me?

197
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:03,833
Let's go Uncle!

198
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,243
What man...

199
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,714
Did you really want to take Manga
to Lodge last night and enjoy?

200
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:11,875
What Uncle?

201
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:12,878
Are you too...

202
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,280
l played a trick to find if
she wanted Sex or Marriage?

203
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,148
Did you find out?

204
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,747
What did you find out?

205
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,719
She doesn't know
what she wants!

206
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,656
She came as she was
sent by elders!

207
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,755
Here is this!

208
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,058
So you say she came
through them!

209
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:30,767
Uncle!

210
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,032
if l had spoiled or raped
and not married,

211
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,532
Did they think what her
life would have been?

212
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,367
As parents, it's their intention
for their daughter's marriage!

213
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,842
l feel pity for the individuals
by thinking of their weakness!

214
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,204
l get anger too...

215
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,547
The fickle minded
person like you...

216
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,482
should get a sentimental girl...

217
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,485
Dear lliana!

218
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,748
Pick out a card on her name!

219
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,617
What's your name?

220
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,723
My name is Hamsa Vahini!

221
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,553
...lt's the name of
Saraswathi Devi!

222
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,227
Parrot...

223
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,728
Please Pick out a card if l

224
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,490
You are my golden parrot,
aren't you?

225
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,600
This parrot doesn't
watch movies!

226
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,430
lt says if you get husband!

227
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,299
But it is aware of Love...!

228
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,671
Why do you laugh?

229
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,804
Getting husband is not
important!

230
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,111
Getting lovable husband
is essential!

231
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,245
What's in love...

232
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,177
Tender aged girls will be
loved by anyone!

233
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,747
But marriage is difficult!

234
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,048
Won't you know your fortune?

235
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:23,788
Not required...

236
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,786
l don't know what it says!

237
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:25,647
lt's okay...

238
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,120
lt's time for Muhurtham
let's go...

239
00:10:58,891 --> 00:10:59,789
You stand there...

240
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,323
lf an unmarried girl
gets blessed,

241
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,961
she gets married soon!

242
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,132
Somehow l get married!

243
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,275
But get me a lovable husband!

244
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,371
Why will you start
tomorrow itself?

245
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,410
lf you wait for 2 days,

246
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,914
we shall leave together,
shun't we?

247

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,051
l can't stay here leaving
my office work!

249
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,314
Your food?

250
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,149
That's not possible at all!

251
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,484
Love is youngsters!

252
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,225
Dowries and presents
are elders!

253
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,793
Only after you give us
the discussed things,

254
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:37,928

can take place!

255
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,493

258
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,003
lt couldn't be adjusted
at the last hour!

259
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,101
Forgive me!

260
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,034
l don't want the installment
schemes!

261
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,807
We shall arrange the first night
after the settlement!

262
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,238
Are you trying to make
the things move

263
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,036
without settlement?

264
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,336

265
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,536

Come here!

267
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,454
Why are you calm while
such things going on?

268
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,089
My father is strict in
the matter of money!

269
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,054
We should be tight
during this time!

270
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,592
So...will you get inside

271
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,453
only if they give you money?

272
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,391
Do you know what it is called?

273
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:16,798
Adultery!

274
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,828
You need not marry for this!

275
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,207
You may start a business
standing at some centre!

276
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,112
l am not such a cheap guy!

277
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,475
Not cheap...you are too costly!

278
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,545
Else...situation wouldn't
have come so far!

279
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,580
Once you have a look
at your wife!

281
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,027
She is not crying for the

She is crying for she married
an adultery man!

284
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,264
Listen to my words!

285
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,699
Don't play with her.

286
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,460

00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,274
Sparklings of the shawl there!

296
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,844

00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,166
Sparklings of the shawl there!

306
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,603
Heart beatings are here!

00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,539
Sparklings of Jeans there!

308
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,713

Sambo! Sambo!

310
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,751

312
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,826

Breeze has come silently!

315
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,601
Marriage means beautiful drums!

316
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:43,137

there are eyes!

317
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:49,872
King Swan has rolled

That's why we have

You know many things!

341
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,045

People like you are very rare!

349

Okay...

350
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,272
You said nothing about yourself!

352
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,225

00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,825
You may have tiffins or meals!

355
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,802
Hey...wash the glasses well!

You drowsy fellow!

The second is to hit him
for the broken glass!

366

Will you beat me then?

367

He has just beat you!
lf it was me...

368
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,259
Though he is a worker
how can he hit him?

369
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,866
lt's not sin to hit
such fellows!

370
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,060
lt's not enough to hit
him for child labour,

371
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,829
his hotel should be
deconstructed...

372
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,944
You gathered crowd
behind me

373
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,979
and added pretty well
to my voice!

374
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:56,247
But none had come forward
while injustice going on!

375
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,384
lf any one of you had
rebelled before me,

376
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,886
that child wouldn't have
been hit!

377
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,196
ln our absence after our
bus moves,

378
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,829
lf you show your grudge
on him again,

379
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,832
l will send you to Jail under
the act of Child Labour!

380
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,732
Understand?

381
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,041
l think l paid the rent
for this month!

382
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,305
As l heard music...

383
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,276
What's this?

384
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,419
You were dancing well,
weren't you?

385
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,180
l couldn't help enjoying
by seeing that...

386
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,187
l didn't dance for your
enjoyment!

387
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,916
For my sake and my
enjoyment sake!

388
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,255
What's this?

389
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,622
He appreciated as he had seen!

390
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,764
Why do you talk so instead
of thanking him!

391
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:47,727
Correct! Correct!

392
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,563
Does your husband think
it's a free show

393
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,000
to enjoy whenever he
desires?

394
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,167
Will you ask us to go
being a tenant?

395
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:58,843
This is correct!

396
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,705
As long as l pay rent,
it's my place!

397
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,879
This is dam correct!

398
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:04,578
Come on!

399
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,977
Don't hit me before the girl!
lt doesn't seem good!

400
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,875
lf it's known that
a girl is alone,

401
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,643
Even useless rascals
will try!

402
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,349
Why do you stay alone facing
such difficulties?

403
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,718
You can marry a fool,
can't you?

404
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,689
lt looks like picnic
before marriage!

405
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,689
Looks like punishment later!

406
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,529
Marriage doesn't suit my body!

407
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,097
l feel laying together is
better than marriage!

408
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:26,998
Which girl does agree for this?

409
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,771
They always prefer the risk
to marry the fool

410
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,499
they see for 10 minutes
in the function.

411
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,036
l am ready!

412
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,143
Not about you...

413
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,377
l am talking to lay together
with girls!

414
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,516
Stop the jokes!

415
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,546
The relation to share
Cigarette and drink

416
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,817
with you is enough for me!

417
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,391
Who can handle you
beyond that?

418
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,695
Leave my topic...

419
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,228
l think you are laying tracks
for Benz car baby!

420
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,495
What is laying tracks?

421
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,138
lt seems she had already
had tracks...

422
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,864
The day before yesterday she
asked him to come home

423
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,303
saying none was at home!

424
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,168
He had gone eagerly...

425
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,846
Had it worked out?

426
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,105
What's to work out?

427
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,280
Really none was there at home!
lt was locked!

428
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,983
You were fooled again!

429
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,924
lt'd be better if the word
''LOVE'' got banned!

430
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,458
'LOVE', 'lshq',

431
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,657
These are not only
2 letter words!

432
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,860
lt's fuel that runs two lives!

433
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,224
ls this love present in the
story you brought?

434
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,902
A big joint family...

435
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,365
Rayudu has 2 sons and
4 daughters!

436
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,870
One maid too...

437
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:41,103
They all together were
celebrating Sankranthi!

438
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,680
Maid would mix the cow dung
and sprinkle water around,

439
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:45,941
wearing attractive clothes!

440
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,085
Don't get excited...
Let me say!

441
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,020
Don't forget to tell
about the maid...

442
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:50,551
Proceed...

443
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,653
Please don't mind!

444
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:52,789
lt's maid weakness!

445
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,980
lt seems she is committed!

446
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:56,955
Where did we come till now?

447
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,620
Till l come to Hyderabad
selling my chilly farm!

448
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,060
l am asking in the story!

449
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,199
Sankranthi Festival!

450
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,302
Suddenly enters Rayudu's second
family like Tsunami!

451
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,632
His wife gets shocked!

452
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,704
Eldest son and eldest
daughter-in-law

453
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:10,567
would get seperated!

454
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,764
Properties were shared!

455
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,205
Second son had become drunkard!

456
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,379
Eldest daughter would be
jailed in raid!

457
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:15,944
Stop it!

458
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,982
Enemity, revenge, jeslousy,
short temper

459
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,048
What else present except
these in the story?

460
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:23,285
ls it the serial to display
in homes?

461
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,891
Murders, Kidnappings, illegal
contacts and Rapes!

462
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,156
ls always difficulties
and tears?

463
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,252
Don't you watch TV often?

464
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,261
Ladies are sitting at
TV to cry...!

465
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,997
They are bearing these garbage

466
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:38,726
as they have no other go!

467
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,298
TV Media is very powerful!

468
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,631
Serials should show
Love and affection!

469
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,476
Human relations should
be polished!

470
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:46,644
Values should be developed!

471
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,312
Writer...note this point!

472
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,241
Let it be between us!

473
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,438
Don't forget about
the maid...

474
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,083
l don't forget...

475
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:53,876
We leave madam!

476
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,644
A maid's love story!

477
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:57,787
We get it ready!

478
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,355
Have you finished the
lectures about Love?

479
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,287
lt's okay...

480
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,517
What's your Sandeep saying?

481
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,521
He went upset as l denied
to go to movie!

482
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,356
Why did you say so?

483
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,362
Take permission and go!

484
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,330
l will manage with something
if Boss asks!

485
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,229
All the best!

486
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:12,292
Thanks!

487
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,862
No Channel writings...

488
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,131
No sponsorings...

489
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,205
No dates for actors...

490
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,034
lf l think of that...

491
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,373
My rating of BP, Heart attack
and Sugar increase!

492
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,946
Not worrying about these,

493
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,845
you are talking about
boy friends happily!

494
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,917
We are talking about a Script!

495
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,519
Are you talking about Script?

496
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:31,818
Look here!

497
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,054
100 years to your boy friend...

498
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,783
My mother is calling
from hometown!

499
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:36,483
Mother?

500
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:37,919
Let me also talk with her!

501
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,093
Give me...

502
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,423
Mother is a mother to all!

503
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,792
Why did you take much time
to receive darling?

504
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,491
ls that Cockroach mustache
fellow Kamaraj around?

505
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,762
Hasn't he passed away yet
being a patient of

506
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,667
heart attack, sugar and BP?

507
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,804
Okay...we may get affected
if we talk about him!

508
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,167
We shall meet in the evening!

509
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,005
Come out giving some
lame excuses!

510
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:55,577
Okay?

511
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,775
This is the way to get
slapped in the streets!

512
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,950
l leave...

513
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:07,414
Sir...

514
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,688
How did you get the
wonderful idea

515
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,486
to switch on the cell
phone speaker?

516
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:12,594
Creativity...

517
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,492
Having more creativity...

518
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,529
That's why ratings are low!

519
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,860
you are crossing your
limits l guess...

520
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,866
Hey...Coffee!

521
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,803
...Why do you shout for coffee
watching ethical entertainments?

522
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,413
if you don't like Swami,

523
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,343
You can switch off the TV
can't you?

524
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,513
Whatever we do...

525
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,241
lnitially conscience should
get contented!

526
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,514
Mind doesn't divert towards
heaven unless l have coffee!

527
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:38,920
Okay...happy!

528
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,615
lf you stop shaking your legs
and shouting for coffee,

529
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,884
Heaven itself comes here!

530
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,062
Here is!

531
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:45,592
Mother!

532
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,959
Why is it noisy upstairs?

533
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,393
l forgot to tell you...

534
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,466
First floor was given for
rent yesterday itself!

535
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,235
ls it such a necessary now?

536
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,971
Not for the necessity
of money!

537
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,707
Someone should be with me,
right?

538
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,976
lf you got married
by this time...

539
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,202
Stop it mother!

540
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,304
Have you diverted the topic
towards it again?

541
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,594
Thasyaru...the girl is going!

542
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,391
come soon!

543
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,030
Hey...girl!

544
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,361
A man had come for you!

545
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,396
Okay!

546
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,637
She says okay!

547
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,306
Tell her not the guy
came yesterday!

548
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,235
l asked you to shut your

00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,630

What's the link between
Husband and Rangoli?

596
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:18,714
Nothing but foolishness!

00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,817

00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,295
lf it's hit on the cheek,
it's Pachkad!

792
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,932
lf it's hit on the ears,
it's Byri!

793
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,305
lf it's hit on head,
it's Dappa!

794
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,374
lf it's hit on the neck...?

795
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,506
What it's called if
it's hit by head?

796
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,443
Ditcha!

797
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,112
Shall l give you one?

798
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:21,580
Get in...Get in!

799
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,978
What you say looks like Cinema!

800
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,925
Rowdies tease heroine
in the bus...

801
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,354
Hero hits them...

802
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:31,891
ln cinema after the fight...

803
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,725
Hero talks lovely with
Heroine, doesn't he?

804
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,297
lt's reverse here!

805

He went talking harshly...

806
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,193
That's the difference between
Cinema and life!

807
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,101
Why do you face these risks?

808
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,366
You can happily buy a
moped, can't you?

809
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,510
No...l can't!

810
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,676
While trying to learn moped...

811
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,074
l fell three times!

812
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,508
My nose bled...

813
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,343
l don't want these
mopeds at all!

814
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,118
Don't you ever get on
the bike?

815
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,912
While my husband rides
scooter...

816
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,680
laying my hands around
his hip...

817
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,256
l enjoy the ride leaning
against his back...

818
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,021
So...untill you get
a prince...

819
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:05,991
you say you won't get
on the bike!

820
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,061
l never get on...

821
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,993
l will die if l get on!

822
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:17,697
Yes boss!

823
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,570
Where did you die without
finishing the task given?

824
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,436
l am in the mortuary
room boss!

825
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,079
Have you died then?

826
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,173
No boss...

827
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,946
As police were chasing...

828
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,483
l have come and died here
to escape from them!

829
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,778
You should finish the bomb blast
by Valentine's day!

830
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,388
Else you will remain in
the mortuary room itself!

831
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,148
Okay boss!

832
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,081
Sister...

833
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,486
Shift the patient from
Room No.3!

834
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:37,254
Hi Teens darling!

835
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:37,826

838
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,565
But it was late!

839

00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:56,973
What man...Don't you see!

842
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,679
Wearing black glasses...

843
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,310
Won't you observe the person

845
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:13,727
Why do you look into
my eye doctor?

846
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,262
Stop it...
Doesn't he know?

847
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,292
Test the nose...

848
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:17,990
That's not required!

849
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,259
Give your hand...

850
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:20,968
What way he is related
to you?

851
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,001

855
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,408
What's the problem?

856
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,044

We have put in your hands,

862

What's that?

863

Belly...

864
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:39,786
Not belly...stomach!

865
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,117

00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,322
Your guy should undergo
operation!

869
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,056
No other way?

870
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,494

Theatre doesn't mean
lMAX theatre...

885
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,289
Operation theatre!

886
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,190
Nurse...

887
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,289
Take the patient and make him
lie down on the table!

888
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,557
l don't have the habit of
lying down on the table!

889
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,559
l lie on the cot!

890
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,960

00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,759
Else you can lie in

Don't l fear to do operation?

Why am l doing boldly?

900
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:36,642
Lie down closing your eyes!

901
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:37,544
l am not sleepy!

902
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:38,980
He is not sleepy...

903
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,115
Hold him and lull!

904
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:40,681

Shit...you lie down!

906
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:42,251
You inject...

907
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:43,578
No doctor...

00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,418
l will die...l will die!

909
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,488
How can you die yourself
while we are here!

910
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,750
Why is this hospital and we

911
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,551
Take my watch...

912
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:52,858
Give me the gloves!

913
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:53,927
Sir...your cell phone!

914
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:58,228
l feel like an important organ
is left if it's not here!

915
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:58,764
Let it be here!

916
00:43:58,969 --> 00:43:59,867
lt's difficult if it rings!

917
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:00,593
lt makes sound...

918
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,532
Let me switch it off!

919
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,832
My heart makes sound,
shall l stop it?

920
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:04,598
No sir!

921
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,365
Don't talk more!

922
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,238
l scissor it away!
Take the scissors!

923
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,709
l asked you not to talk more,
didn't l?

924
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:11,346
No sir...

925
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,310
Take that scissors!

926
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:13,809
Okay sir!

927
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,221
Let him be alive!

928
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,101
Our Pulla Rao's operation is
successful, isn't it?

929
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,171
l will tell you if he
opens his eyes!

930
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:39,865
Doubt?

931
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,509
...lf he opens his eyes
then only l come to know

932
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,179
if the operation is successful!

933
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:46,215
Who is she?

934
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:46,974
My wife...

935
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:49,744
You may go...

936
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:50,885
you are busy, aren't you?

937
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:52,620
Let's go...

938
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,586
Doctor...Doctor!
Alas...

939
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:55,724
What happened?

940
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,223
Doctor has forgotten his
cellphone!

941
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:00,363
Oh...cellphone?

942
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:01,826
will come and collect
it later!

943
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,327
Let's go...

944
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:05,959
not forgotten the cell
outside...

945
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:06,795
inside the patient's stomach!

946
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,969
When l married your
eldest daughter...

947
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,198
You gave half of the
dowry and said

948
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,432
you would give on
Shiva Rathri!

949
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:12,904
What happened?

950
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,202
You killed her on Sankranthi,
didn't you?

951
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,400
What's credit after she
had passed away?

952
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:16,772
What do l have to give you?

953
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,412
What you have?

954
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,309
lnstead of this Swan you
have given me a crow!

955
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:21,141
Do one thing!

956
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,476
Let me marry her...

957
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,948
My food and bed problems
will be solved!

958
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,018
Are you planning to
kill her too?

959
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,313
lf l kill you...

960
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:27,686
Honey...

961
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,153
Tell him you would give
him by taking loan!

962
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,223
Else he will kill me!

963
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,120
l apply for loan and get
your credit cleared!

964
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:34,990
by when?

965
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,288
Within 10 days!

966
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,592
Unless you pay within
10 days...

967
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,132
Your daddy loses his breathe!

968
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,268
lf you give me Rs.100/-
as interest,

969
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:43,235
l will go and have drink!

970
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,004
Excuse me...Excuse me!

971
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,040
One minute!

972
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,273
l want to talk with you!

973
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,715
l have meeting in the office!
Just five minutes!

974
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:02,624
My sister Vedavathi!

975
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,223
She is very innocent!
She is very ignorant!

976
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:08,856
l am not aware of you well!

977
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:12,294
ls it necessary to know about
your ignorant sister?

978
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:13,760
Please...

979
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:14,767
Just listen to me
for a while!

980
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,069
She was married to Chalapathi!

981
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,967
he is a rowdy like my
house owner's son!

982
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,675
My Sister was hit, tortured!

983
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,272
My sister committed
suicide then!

984
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,650
Hi Sanju!

985
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:31,813
Why are you here?

986
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:33,348
Nothing...

987
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,916
She is working for some
TV channel!

988
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:36,726
Name...

989
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:37,986
Your name?

990
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:39,719
Hamsa...Hamsa Vahini!

991
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,022
lt's Saraswathi Devi's name!

992
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:41,595
Beautiful!

993
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,492
Your name is as nice as you are!

994
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,193
By the way...l am Venu!

995
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:46,266
My hobby is to watch TV!

996
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,398
Please listen to the rest!

997
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,267
My brother-in-law is irritating
us for the dowry balance!

998
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,441
Though sister died...

999
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,670
He wants to marry me instead
of the dowry balance!

1000
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,843
if not...He threatens that
he kills my father!

1001
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,143
What should l do in
this situation?

1002
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:05,444
Take a strong iron rod and
smash his brain!

1003
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,821
Else file a complaint and
get him arrested!

1004
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,028
lf you tell your tragedy
stories

1005
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,529
to unknown people like me
...nothing happens!

1006
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:20,536
l have an important meeting
in the office...

1007
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:21,394
l have to go!

1008
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,010
Please wipe your tears!

1009
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:36,113
His character is different!

1010
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,044
He doesn't know the soul
has sympathy

1011
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,847
and the word has regard!

1012
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,155
Please forget him!

1013
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:42,990
As soon as l heard
your story...,

1014
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,161
l felt you have such a
tragedy behind you

1015
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,193
like a rose has thorns!

1016
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,499
lf l can't solve it
my life gets wasted!

1017
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,300
Can you also hit rowdies
like him?

1018
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,705
Hitting is not a great thing!

1019
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,230
We can hit chasing them!

1020
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,233
But it's a temperary solution
for your problem!

1021
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,003
Not a permanent solution!

1022
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,671
Don't l have a permanent
solution then?

1023
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,543
Why can't it if
this Venu thinks?

1024
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,678
l know a famous lawyer!

1025
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,586
filing an attempt murder
case on him

1026
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,223
and get him atleast
10 years imprisonment!

1027
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,286
l am responsible for that!

1028
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,355
Really?

1029
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,822
Promise...believe me!

1030
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,212
You?

1031
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,180
What...you are here?

1032
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:43,944
lt's amazing!

1033
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,812
lt's not a surprise that
l am in my home!

1034
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,615
lt's a surprise that
you are in my home!

1035
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,722
So...our house owner's son...

1036
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:50,951
l am that rowdy...

1037
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:54,896
l really didn't think
it's you!

1038
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,030
When daddy said,

1039
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,425
l thought it's someone else!

1040
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,097
Alas...What honey!

1041
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,962
You wanted to maintain
silence during these

1042
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:02,695
40 days vow!

1043
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,464
But you talked on the
last day!

1044
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,437
40 days?

1045
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,237
As far as my knowledge,

1046
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,415
this baby can't be silent
for atleast 4 minutes!

1047
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,014
lt seems l don't have the
fate to get good husband!

1048
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,412
That's why it happened so!

1049
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:21,952
That girl has all good
qualities!

1050
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,827
Respect, humility, beauty...

1051
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,496
Pick up, mileage, warranty...

1052
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,268
She is okay!

1053
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,897
But...other than look,

1054
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,305
She is educated and independent!

1055
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,099
She supports her father
doing some job!

1056
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,040
Her character is quite
opposite to yours!

1057
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:51,247
One should learn from me
how to enjoy the life!

1058
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,521
Greetings Venu...

1059
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:57,386
Maheshraju?

1060
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,356
lf we go for such a
great lawyer,

1061
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,622
Fees may be heavy!

1062
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,231
You don't worry about it!

1063
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,195
l will take care!

1064
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,366
He is my close friend!

1065
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:06,561
Thank you!

1066
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,569
Appointment tomorrow?

1067
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,703
Green Park Hotel...
room No 122?

1068
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,165
l will pick you up!

1069
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:15,467
Thank you very much!

1070
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:16,911
l remain...bye!

1071
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,406
Thanks Aunty!

1072
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,380
How can a lawyer be
in a hotel room?

1073
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,222
So...your hero Sanjay
hasn't paid

1074
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,393
any attention towards
your problem!

1075
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:30,855
Yes!

1076
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,120
But his friend Venu is
a very good guy!

1077
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,857
Madam...someone has come
for you!

1078
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,259
l think it's Venu!

1079
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,390
l will be back meeting
the lawyer!

1080
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:47,701
You are here...

1081
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,440
No problem!

1082
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,210
l have come to tell
you one thing!

1083
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,546
My uneducated mother
also doubted

1084
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,776
that if lawyers are
in hotel rooms!

1085
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:58,249
Haven't you got it?

1086
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,716
Venu is a big rogue!

1087
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,857
His hobby is to use girls
and leave!

1088
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,186
You go if you also have
such a hobby!

1089
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,897
lt's your choice...bye!

1090
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:15,471
Hamsa...your bag!

1091
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,268
Venu?

1092
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,509
Very Handsome!

1093
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,075
No...Sanjay!

1094
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,473
He said a shocking matter!

1095
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:32,819
Why do you take risk?

1096
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,580
Tell me the address!
l will go with my father!

1097
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:39,154
Hey Hamsa...

1098
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:40,863
Why should we trouble him?

1099
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:42,156
l took leave for you!

1100
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:42,928
Come on!

1101
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,463
Lawyer would be waiting
for us!

1102
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,263
Hey...take out the hands!

1103
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,697
What's wrong between friends?

1104
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,734
Did you think to take advantage
as l am in danger?

1105
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,972
No lawyer is in the
Green Park hotel!

1106
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,009
But Room was taken on your name!

1107
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,617
What's your plan taking me
to there telling lies?

1108
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,210
Yesterday you agreed to
come to hotel room!

1109
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,354
why did you turn today?

1110
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,114
Not for free...
l give you cash!

1111
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,395
Will you beat me?

1112
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,495
Look what l do...

1113
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:23,930
One thing is not understood!

1114
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,001
Why did you tell Hamsa
that Venu is a Rogue?

1115
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,538
Why did you think he came?

1116
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,313
Since he loves me!

1117
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:32,740
doesn't he?

1118
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:33,916
Even you say No...

1119
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,549
You fell in love with her!

1120
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:40,015
That's why you felt
jealous on Venu!

1121
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,157
As Venu was introduced
through him,

1122
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,189
What is the necessity
to save me?

1123
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:48,891
He would be calm minding
his work, wouldn't he?

1124
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,531
As you were not calm...
it's certainly Love!

1125
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,162
No use Sanjay...
You fell in love!

1126
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,365
People with no work
and purpose

1127
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,373
will love, sink and float!

1128
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,473
But Sanjay is not so!

1129
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,912
Not only Sanjay...Everyone
falls in love one day!

1130
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,109
Some people may know soon!

1131
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,412
Some people may know delayed!

1132
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:13,088
That's it!

1133
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,120
Considering all your words,

1134
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,544

00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,105

l believe and l too love you!

1180
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:50,997
Have you come seeing me?

1181
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:52,931
l came and saw you!

1182
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,564
This shop owner is my friend!
l have come to meet him!

1183
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:56,295
lt's okay...

1184
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,130
You have come at the
right time!

1185
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,736
l want to buy an Air cooler
in the lnstallments scheme!

1186
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,504
They are asking for
surity signature!

1187
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:08,840
Let's go!

1188
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,689
You taught a good lesson
to Sankar!

1189
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:14,754
Dappa's and Ditchs's!

1190
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,152
Pachkad's and Byri's too!

1191
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,918
Do you know him earlier?

1192
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:19,918
Then just formality!
Come on!

1193
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,089
Sign here!

1194
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,667
Don't you get sleep unless you
buy cooler in lnstallments?

1195
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,837
Alas...
Not for me...!

1196
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,297
My brother and sister-in-law
are coming from America!

1197
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,201
for them...

1198
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,842
People habituated to
that climate

1199
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,004
can't bear our heat!

1200
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,779
They can't have water too!

1201
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,243
They drink only mineral water!

1202
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,582
lt's how long since they
have gone there?

1203
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,752
lt's one year!

1204
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,615
Wow...it's quite long time!

1205
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,017
So you have to take
more credits!

1206
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,053
lt's difficult!

1207
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:51,821
For relatives...

1208
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,962
how if we feel difficult
for this?

1209
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,490
Whom l have except them?

1210
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,035
Why are staring at?

1211
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,101
Your bra strap!

1212
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:02,429
Set it right!

1213
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,748
Thank you for giving surity!

1214
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,683
Excuse me...one minute!

1215
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,118
Nothing!

1216
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,295
You look nice if you smile!

1217
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:28,831
But you never laugh!

1218
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,659
lt's thought mad if we
always laugh!

1219
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,039
My daughter said she
would take PF loan

1220
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,013
and give you, didn't she?

1221
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,211
lt has not come yet!

1222
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:51,751
lt takes a week!

1223
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:52,911
Leave me!

1224
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:54,683
lf you come and sit
on my neck,

1225
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:55,619
Where should l bring from?

1226
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,818
How did you buy A/C cooler?

1227
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:01,596
Don't you have to give me?

1228
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,027
Don't you feel shy to drink
and quarrel at night?

1229
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:04,597
Remove the hand!

1230
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,302
lf l went to temple and
have flower in the ear

1231
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:08,333
will you pay me back?

1232
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,036
When will you clear my balance?

1233
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,968
l applied for loan
not yet sanctioned!

1234
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,073
When will it get sanctioned?

1235
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:16,712
Will it come for my
death funeral?

1236
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,011
That's not possible!

1237
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,473
l want it right now!

1238
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,875
Else l will drag you too!

1239
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,286
My golden hen!

1240
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,747
You can lay your salary
eggs in my home!

1241
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:28,286
come on!

1242
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:29,123
Daddy...

1243
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:30,551
Leave her!

1244
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,691
For missing your daughter's
salary?

1245
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,327
Not interested to go home
without wife!

1246
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,668
Who are you?

1247
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:48,874
You can tell by your
mouth, can't you?

1248
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,451
Come on...
Sanjay takes care!

1249
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,983
The previous shot was for
disturbing my sleep!

1250
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,832
This is for breaking
the flower pot!

1251
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,103
...You beat very hard!
ls it very costly pot?

1252
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,816
Why is this sir?

1253
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,017
This is for you to not
ascend our steps again!

1254
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,552
l can't ascend my home
steps itself!

1255
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,591
Then...How can l ascend
your steps sir?

1256
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,331
l can sleep well now!

1257
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,112
l thought he is rowdy!

1258
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,041
House owner's son is
a good man!

1259
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:08,357
A brave rowdy is better
than a timid gentleman!

1260
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,754
Since yesterday, Hamsa has
been going to bazaar!

1261
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,188
Her brother and sister-in-law
came from America!

1262
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:45,621
What Maya...what's the plan?

1263
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:51,099
l will come!

1264
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,232
Why do you need how l come?

1265
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:53,827
l will be there within
half an hour!

1266
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:55,467
Bunny...

1267
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,468
l don't have a habit of
coming late like you!

1268
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:03,410
Will you kiss me?

1269
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,307
l will give you chocolate!

1270
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,171
You know about me, don't you?

1271
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:08,846
Have l ever come late?

1272
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,182
What Ramanathan was telling
till then?

1273
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,087
As he didn't come for
eldest daughter's death,

1274
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,362
''l will not see his
face at all''.

1275
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:24,658
Now he makes Hamsa make credits!

1276
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,459
l asked him the same!

1277
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,737
He says girl is to go away!

1278
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:32,166
Son is the one who
honours his name!

1279
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,706
that's why he is praising him!

1280
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:34,501
Poor girl...

1281
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,211
As her brother brings
a scent bottle,

1282
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,277
she melts in the sentiment
and works hard!

1283
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,111
She does job and feeds
her father...

1284
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,115
But praises and rewards
for them!

1285
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,851
Why does the duck feel pain
as Swan didn't?

1286
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,185
Have you heard the moral
of our son?

1287
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,052
Seems it's happening according
to the formula of love story!

1288
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,059
Nothing...

1289
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:57,960
You are talking too much too...

1290
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,635
l have just sympathy on her!

1291
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:03,966
Hey...have a look there once!

1292
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:04,970
l think it's your Hamsa!

1293
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,103
Are you drinking coffee or
added something else?

1294
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,235
Have a look once!

1295
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:18,617
lt's Hamsa, isn't it?

1296
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,286
l know...

1297
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,159
Sanjay's friend and colleague!

1298
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,402
lt seems you have come on
an important work!

1299
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:41,606
You just carry on!

1300
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:42,644
Bye Jay...

1301
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,107
l have doctor's appointment!

1302
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,608
Doctor?...Why?

1303
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,382
Have a small work...

1304
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,184
Abortion...

1305
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:50,514
Again?

1306
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,313
Do you have sense at all?

1307
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,558
l think she is not married!

1308
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,762
Then...

1309
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,191
What's the relation between
marriage and this?

1310
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:07,926
Shit...

1311
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,201
She is a girl...

1312
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:10,703
Since she is a girl...

1313
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,072
she faces this situation!

1314
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:17,237
What do you want then?

1315
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:22,041
You have to stop talking
with her!

1316
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,092
How long has been the relation
between us?

1317
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,325
Almost 40 days, right?

1318
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:37,095
But for Maya and me...
7 years!

1319
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,634
But she never asked me not to
talk with particular person!

1320
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:46,939
You have more interest on
other's life

1321
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:47,666
rather than yours!

1322
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:48,868
Why?

1323
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:50,946
Because...

1324
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,447
that...that...What's that?

1325
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,426
Since l wanted to marry you!

1326
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,810
What's there to laugh in this?

1327
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,606
What do you know about me?

1328
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,075
ln the first sight...

1329
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,149
My desired husband qualities
are seen!

1330
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:37,287
l thought l would be happy
if l marry you!

1331
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,754
Before my brother and in-law
goes back to America,

1332
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,597
l would like this good
occasion to happen!

1333
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:46,861
Sorry...

1334
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:51,000
lf you feel otherwise as
l am expressing directly!

1335
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:04,116
To be frank l never thought
of marriage till now!

1336
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:07,821
Give me two-three days time!

1337
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:09,957
l tell you thinking over that!

1338
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,655
Okay...

1339
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:13,658
l leave!

1340
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,630
lt's enough if you say 'YES'.

1341
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,607
l went to temple and did pooja!

1342
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,371
Here is Prasadham and flowers!

1343
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,149
Have you vowed anything?

1344
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,918
Desires won't be fulfilled
with the vow to God!

1345
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,850
We get strength and bravery
to attain it!

1346
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:44,782
What brother-in-law?

1347
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,529
...Do l have any work rather
than my daughter's marriage!

1348
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,025
What?

1349
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,888
Good Alliance fixed for Manga?

1350
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:53,626
Your brother is kidding!

1351
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,963
He asks if good alliance
fixed for Manga!

1352
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:57,230
What words are they brother?

1353
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,634
lt's pure Telugu words!

1354
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,001
Stop joking brother!

1355
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,374
Whom shall we give Manga
except Sanjay?

1356
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:03,202
Brother...

1357
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,377
Day and night...

1358
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,513
Always she thinks of
her brother-in-law!

1359
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:07,181
What's this?

1360
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,248
...You would be scolding that
sister often thinks of cinema!

1361
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,384
Brother...

1362
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,920
Now a days...she dreams her
brother-in-law!

1363
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:17,991
While sister sleeps no other
word is heard except snoring!

1364
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,855
Put this kerchief into
your mouth...

1365
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:20,756
l give you 10 rupees!

1366
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,527
He is kidding brother-in-law!

1367
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:24,225
Brother...

1368
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,365
Coming to the point...

1369
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,033
We have come to arrange
marriage for

1370
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,636
my son-in-law and Manga!

1371
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:30,533
What do you say?

1372
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,774
What can your brother
say in this?

1373
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,269
Sanju has to say!

1374
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:35,302
Yes sister!

1375
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,308
Sanjay does as he likes...

1376
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:39,481
He never listens to anyone!

1377
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:40,975
Since he was 10...

1378
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:46,018
He asks shirt, shoes and
ball as he likes!

1379
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,915
l always respected his
desires and opinions!

1380
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,752
The same in his marriage matter!

1381
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,425
Oh! ls it!

1382
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,027
He has to agree...
leave it!

1383
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,255
lf we leave Manga here
for one month

1384
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,624
He himself likes her...

1385
01:08:58,834 --> 01:08:59,391
What do you say sister-in-law?

1386
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:00,765
What Aunty?

1387
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,464
Brother-in-law has not
yet come!

1388
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:03,638
Sister...where is the basket?

1389
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:05,271
What's basket?

1390
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,539
While we started...

1391
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,573
mother asked her to trap
-in-law into the basket!

1392
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,836
That's why l have asked
where the basket was!

1393
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,549
Wow...brother-in-law is coming!

1394
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,046
l feel shy!

1395
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:20,982
l don't know what he asks!

1396
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:24,485
He may ask you to come to
cinema or lodge sister!

1397
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,086
Hey Sanju...

1398
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,427
Your uncle and aunt have
come from Kakinada

1399
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:30,929
to talk with you!

1400
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:31,990
Why...

1401
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:32,929
ls there no phone?

1402
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,399
We can share the words
over phone!

1403
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,769
But can't share the
heart, right?

1404
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,104
That's why we have come
to share

1405
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,798
heart to heart with
brother-in-law!

1406
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:43,776
What Manga?

1407
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:44,870
You have got ready like
cinema heroine!

1408
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,236
What's the matter?

1409
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:48,440
Son-in-law!

1410
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,048
lf you marry Manga...

1411
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:50,775
You can own our 50 acres
of Coconut grove!

1412
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,147
25 lakhs cash!

1413
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:56,688
10 acres of Land and
home in Bapatla!

1414
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,723
Wow! My rate sounds great!

1415
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,356
My parents don't know
my real value!

1416
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:01,859
So...

1417
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:02,825
But sorry Aunty!

1418
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:04,496
Just today afternoon...

1419
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,429
l decided to marry another girl!

1420
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:06,930
What son-in-law?

1421
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,900
lt's not Maya unfortunately,
is it?

1422
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:10,695
No mummy!

1423
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:12,631
Hamsa!

1424
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,309
Really!

1425
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,244
Very happy!

1426
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,571
Your selection is nice!

1427
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:20,543
Why are you standing here?

1428
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,842
We shouldn't be in this city
or home even a second!

1429
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:23,313
Let's go!

1430
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,819
We can watch movie in
lMAX theatre daddy!

1431
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:26,817
Trip will be utilized!

1432
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,182
What trip will be utilized?

1433
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,722
lf l kill all of you and
stay in Jail,

1434
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,154
then the trip will be utilized!

1435
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,956
Brother-in-law...
you are very cunning!

1436
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,324
l thought something...

1437
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:37,631
Sanju...

1438
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,067
You said whole heartedly,
didn't you?

1439
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,634
You did not say to escape
from Uncle, did you?

1440
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:43,836
Mummy...

1441
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,003
lt's not necessary for me
to say something
