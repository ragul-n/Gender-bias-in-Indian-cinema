186
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,380

With the speed of lightning

Some mischief moments
will quiver and flow

194
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,009
This is the world of youth

195
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,134

I couIdn't sit inside

204

Yoga and meditation

225
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,319
Are the rumors true that you and Manjusri
have got secretIy married?

226
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,321
Is this a quiz show?

227
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,588
It's a press meet

228
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,993
This isn't a fiImy affair

229
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,463
Why step into their personaI space?

230
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,123

00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,209
Mr KaiIash, pIease don't go

234
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,074
He's disrespecting the press

235
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,079
Are we here just to wine and dine?

236
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,346
How can you be part of the press
and behave so irresponsibIy?

237
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,542
You intend standing in the next eIection

238
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,248
You'II be fIanked by heroines
on either side of you

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,620
You'II take pictures and
stick them as posters aII over the city

240
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,556
Isn't that the reason
behind aII these events?

241
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,219
WiII you aIways think crooked?

242

We stand in the eIection
onIy to convey our peopIe's thoughts

245
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,705
Boycotting for no reason is not fair

246
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,369
Get up! Are we so inferior?

247
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,837
He's arguing so vehementIy?

248
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,039
Sit down

00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,528
This invoIves kids' education

254
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,120
Why are you so antagonistic?

255
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,323
ReIax

256
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:21,062

Why do you brand me as opposition?

266

Won't you show me the posters
before sticking them?

267
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,134

You are swearing on your baby

Vasanth, don't get demotivated
You have to make sacrifices

Try to snuff it with cIoth

345
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,211
Vasanth, be carefuI

Poorvi, take care

347
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,958
That's enough

348
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,900
Hey Prakash, check if anyone's hurt

Greatjob!

355
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,513
Everyone ran away...cowards

356
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,524
Thank God! I had 4 packets of water
to extinguish the entire fire!

357
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,992

00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:01,264
Hey! Don't mis-use the situation
to our advantage

Few peopIe took notice of us

362
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,166
You spoiIt that Iike a martyr!

363
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,598
Let's go

364
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,346
SiragugaL(wings) extinguished fire
that spread wiId

365
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,511
You deserve onIy 1/2 a star for your fiIm

366
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,020
Put the phone down

367
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,185
In his fiIm the hero is a smuggIer

368
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,694
who ends up a customs officer!

369
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,126
How can he expect a 5 star rating?

370
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,698
- ShameIess!!
- Hey! Look at this!

371
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:33,261
Ashwin manages to see what others don't!

372
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,373
His snaps speak for him

373
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,272
He's a smooth operator!

374
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,867
Okay...stop with appreciating
his photographic skiII!

375
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,214
He's a criminaI

376
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,755
ControversiaI news

377
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,882
Is your source reIiabIe?

378
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,155
I personaIIy spoke to the girI's mother

379
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,894
Drunken oaf of a husband!

380
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,227
Some damn astroIoger said
he shouId marry a teenager

381
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,235
OnIy then he wiII come into power
She's just 13!

382
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,064
How can she be given away to him?

383
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,300
Did you see my eraser?

384
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,708
She's searching for a rubber
when her whoIe Iife is at stake

385
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,573
What kind of a dad is he
to do this to his own daughter!

386
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,480
He bruised my head because
I questioned him

387
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,180
Did you cross check with AIavandhan?

388
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,586
His party office hates reporters

389
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,589
Do you have evidence?

390
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,794
'Alavandhan's divine antics'

391
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:55,451
ArnoId Shaw has said that
beauty and brains don't geI

392
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:05,628
Who eIse but a photographer
in our office?

393
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,789
Do I get a distinction in both?

394
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,461
There are cases that faiI in both

395
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,864
Did you see my articIe?

396
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,639
'Hotel doubles as brothel'

397
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,478
Even coIIege girIs were caught

398
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,475
Take a guess, rate for one night

399
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,915
Haven't taken nor given

400
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,223
Rate according to service

401
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,554
You think so?

402
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,256
What's my rate then?

403
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,922
Don't be a pig!

404
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,067
Size a IittIe too smaII

405
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,570
Can give Rs 108

406
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,899
I'II kick you in your butt

407
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,108
You ShyIock!
What a miser!

408
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,504
Is that aII you'II give?

409
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,238
Her rate?

410
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,406
I'II kiII you both

411
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,177
TeII me

412
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,313
Height is her hurdIe

413
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,548
The guy wouId need a stooI

414
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,852
Okay, how about 35% ?

415
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,537
Is this an office or pIay ground?

416
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,012
Suresh, won't you supervise aII this?

417
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,519
How can I go to the rest room?!

418
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,850
How funny?

419
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,618
No hopes for this office!

420
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,587
Why are you going overboard on him?

421
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,220
He's my guy

422
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,389
Don't you know that?

423
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,631
Your sari was here in the morning

424
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,427
How come it suddenIy sIipped and sIid?

425
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,907
Pipe down, Iady!

426
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,509
You are forever running
behind gIam doIIs?

427
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,584
WiII you come with me
on a tempIe tour?

428
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,079
What a pIace to discuss divinity!!

429
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,454
My zip!!!

430
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,388
How can you come here?

431
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,593
You shook him up!

432
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,762
He's even decorated the waII

433
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,990
AIavandhan has come with his henchmen!

434
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,100
You have cIaimed the wedding
is at 12 tonight

435
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,036
For whom?

436
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:29,630
You and me?

437
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,370
It's 12 now

438
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,473
ShaII we?

439
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,610
ShaII we?

440
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,176
Did I drag you by your hand?

441
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,379
CarefuI, it's the Press

442
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,615
Get Iost 'MBA'!

443
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,284
Sir, pIease sit down
why do you stand here?

444
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,918
-Sir, pIease sit down
-Who the heII are you?

445
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,461
How can you ask me that!?

446
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,724
Who took aII the snaps of you
in aII your Iion's gIory?

447
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,137
Aren't you working in a TamiI newspaper?

448
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,377
Why are you showing off
your EngIish vocabuIary?

449
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,815
For spitting on your pIant?

450
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,258
Ignore them
They don't know your worth

451
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,263
You chased the cop in KoviIpatti viIIage
Iike a revoIver on the rebound!

452
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,135
You don't know the repercussions of this

453
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,330
Let me handIe it

454
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,339
Don't spit there again

455
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,241
Spit it here

456
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,079
Another EngIish expert?

457
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,845
Are you the editor?

458
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,410
Mr Lawyer!

459
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,419
Ask them

460
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,020
We have a smaII probIem
PIease come here

461
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,357
How much did you take
from the ruIing party?

462
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:07,695
Who can make the ruIing party
shake and shiver other than you?

463
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,538
What's this then?

464
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,872
Wedding wishes?

465
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,110
We wrote what the mother
and daughter cIaimed

466
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,913
CaII that woman in

467
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:36,892
You earn a Iiving in my city
and you dare to threaten me

468
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,900
Boss is caIIing you

469
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,603
Why do you troubIe yourseIf by coming here
for such a triviaI matter?

470
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,075
She's here, sir

471
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,481
Who are you?

472
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,077
What did you teII them?

473
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,482
They enquired about
my famiIy identity card

474
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,483
That's when she cIicked my photo

475
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,516
Why are you changing your story?

476
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,027
Come here, my chiId

477
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,490
Do you know me?

478
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,932
I don't know you

479
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,761
Don't be scared to teII the truth

480
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,506
I reaIIy don't know you

481
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,277
Let me go

482
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,074
I have recorded our entire conversation

483
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,118
Show me

484
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,116
Where is it?

485
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:52,975
You can go

486
00:36:54,845 --> 00:37:00,147
Mr PubIisher, we wiII very soon
come to power

487
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,711
This buiIding may vanish into thin air

488
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,822
We'II pubIish your entry into our office
and your threat as headIines

489
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,419
I am maintaining Iow profiIe
since eIection is round the corner

490
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,828
The fauIt is onIy with us

491
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,396
What do we do?

492
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,331
We have to concede

493
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,205
We wiII strike a compromise

494
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,869
How wiII you deIete the news
that is aIready pubIished?

495
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,940
We wiII pubIish your deniaI right away

496
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,583
Why shouId I deny anything?

497
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:34,844
You have to apoIogize

498
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,347
Mr Lawyer
Get to the point

499
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:40,018
ApoIogize or eIse we fiIe
a defamation suit for a biIIion

500
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,989
Let's not cower down for aII these threats

501
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,254
We'II meet them at court

502
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,727
I apoIogize

503
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,832
I want it in the front page

504
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,063
Lion with pride

505
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,365
Pouncing tiger

506
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,040
AII news about AIavandhan is faIse

507
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,745
We apoIogize profuseIy

508
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,049
AII 8 coIumns shouId cover onIy this

509
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,619
Do you get me?

510
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,913
Take a written statement from them

511
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,090
You there!

512
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,493
You were hunting for something

513
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,629
Is it this?

514
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,134
It's empty

515
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,796
Just Iike you

516
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,299
You can have it

517
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,981
That Iady is changing her story
out of sheer force

518
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,751
Someone here has stoIen it
and erased everything

519
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,097
I was the one who approved her story

520
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,935
You were dismissed 10 minutes ago

521
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,542
Govt wine shop

522
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,964
Do I Iook Iike a beggar to you?

523
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,975
Did I ask you for a peg?

524
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,511
I refiIIed your gIass

525
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,546
As if I can't buy it for myseIf

526
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,848
Do you know my status from tomorrow?

527
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,217
Do you know who I am?

528
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,088
You are AIavandhan's
'use and throw' hand

529
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,217
What did you say?

530
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,730
I said you are his 'right hand'!

531
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:01,964
I sense something wrong here

532
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,762
You are too high spirited

533
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,036
I'II Ieave now

534
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,599
You aIready offered, then what?

535
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,832
Is it foreign Iiquor?

536
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,166
Get down!

537
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,803
I don't want to

538
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,221
Go, sit there

539
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,123
Don't push the chiId

540
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,159
I don't want to, dad

541
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:42,864
Let's begin

542
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,324
WeIcome, sir

543
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,062
Drunk at your daughter's wedding

544
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,230
Sir, come sit next to the girI

545
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,470

Let the auspicious drums beat

549
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:18,726
Go...go...go

550
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,390
A donkey is a good omen

551
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:32,231
There's no defeat for you in poIitics

552
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,309
Tie the sacred marriage thread

553
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,512
Didn't you take money?
Why are you crying?

554
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,415
Shut up

555
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:50,591

He was somewhere there

559
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,760
Raj sir, did you see VeI?

560
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,440
He Ieft in the other car

561
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:22,855
Subject: Letter of resignation

562
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,724
Unconditional apology
to the golden icon of the south

563
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,827
How did he puII this off in darkness?

564
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,591
It's aII our training

565
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,829
Smart kid

566
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,164
LittIe pIayfuI, that's aII

567
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,502
We are Iate for printing deadIine
Agent is mad

We'II get 100,000 copies extra order

570
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:20,708
WiII we face any IegaI probIems
if we pubIish a 13 year oId girI's snap?

571
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,349
Not raped

572
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,587
Minor marriage

573
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:25,686
Marriage is void

574
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:29,088
If it heIps to save her, go right ahead

575
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,630
How many typo errors?

576
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,191
Why are you Iooking at?

577
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,700
Did you taIk to the pubIisher?

578
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,041
Is the front page Iay out okay?

579
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,385
Alavandhan's abnormal act
Married a 13 year old minor

580
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,913
Serves AIavandhan right!

581
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,382
You did a greatjob

582
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:44,431
You not onIy saved me
but my job and dignity

583
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,774
You were awesome!

584
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,947
We rock?!

585
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,341
What happened?

586
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,509
You've rejoined
What now?

587
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,957
My dream...my convictions

588
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,121
They aImost dug my grave

589
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:20,633
How can I...ever...thank

590
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:24,140
How can I repay you?

591
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:26,843
You can

592
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,239
Give me Rs 10000

593
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,676
We can throw a party for aII

594
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,461
Something somehow...

595
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,058
...thoughts flood my dreams

596
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,729
Kaleidoscopic hues
in my memory streams

597
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,399
Darkness clouds
my reality themes

598
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:34,005
Something somehow...

599
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,602
...roots deep in my heart

600
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:42,151
The moment l cut it apart
...a bud gets a head start

601
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:46,615
Wonder why
it's out of focus

602
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,213
lmages smudged, a blur display

603
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:53,422
A hazy shapeless future

604
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,227
Wonder why
it's out of focus

605
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,824
lmages smeared, a blur display

606
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:03,373
My dawn of this haIf hearted nature

607
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,703
Something somehow...

608
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,300
...in my eyes sparkles and fades

609
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,903
Dissuades and persuades

610
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,847
Explores...explodes in light and shade

611
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,181
Something somehow...

612
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,846
...captures my heart
that awaits a liaison

613
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,516
ln my dreams wings stretch
...to flutter and fly

614
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:25,117
into the distant horizon

615
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,857
Wonder why
lt's out of focus

616
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,456
lmages smudged, a blur display

617
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:35,061
A hazy shapeless future

618
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:39,472
Wonder why
lt's out of focus

619
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,066
lmages smudged, a blur display

620
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:46,013
my dawn of this haIf hearted nature

621
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:50,548
Are we mere mechanic montage?

622
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,088
Or a magical illusion...a mirage?

623
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:23,581
Kiss of your breath
ruined me ruthlessly

624
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:28,852
Distance between us, my girl
was made by me purposely

625
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,189
Don't come an inch closer

626
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:34,127
You will poison my mind further

627
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,461
Girl, don't call me hereafter

628
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,330
my fears would get printed on paper

629
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:44,339
Enough...your smile and you
invade me, creating senses new

630
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,931
Something somehow...

631
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,671
...thoughts flood my dreams

632
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,009
Kaleidoscopic hues
ln my memory streams

633
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,145
Darkness clouds
my reality themes

634
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,549
Something somehow...

635
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,213
...roots deep in my heart

636
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:04,692
The moment l cut it apart
...a bud gets a head-start

637
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:09,831
Are we mere mechanical montage?

638
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,629
Or a magical illusion...a mirage?

639
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,899
My girlie Thamizhachi

640
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:21,501
l am unable to erase
how my heart raced that day

641
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,102
Your heart so sweet

642
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,774
Belong to me for eternity

643
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,374
Lady looking like cindrella cindrella

644
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,114
You are the fresh breeze
with that impish glow

645
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,713
Lady looking like a cindrella cindrella

646
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,385
You are the silver moon
that follows me 'gung-ho'!

647
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,985
Lady looking like cindrella cindrella

648
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,657
You are the fresh breeze

649
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,257
Lady looking like a cindrella cindrella

650
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,928
You are the silver moon
that follows me 'gung-ho'!

651
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:53,271
Why, in a haste l can't explain
my eyes search for you around?

652
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:58,609
My ears extract your voice
from every other sound?

653
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:03,948
ls the mission of my eyes
to just dream about you?

654
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:09,219
Did l get my answer seeing
teardrops glisten like dew?

655
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:14,093
Am l, my dear
a shadow stealing toddler?

656
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,357
Somehow...

657
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,290
...thoughts flood my dreams

658
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,026
Kaleidoscopic hues

00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,834
Darkness clouds my reality themes

660
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,299

00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,623
They are creating havoc here

692
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:37,690
Connect me to the commissioner

693
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,714
They came in a group to hit us

694
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,710
Every hut is bribed with a 1000 rupee note

695
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,312
When we questioned their bribery
they chased us and hit us

696
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,914
How many cars, vans, posters?

697

You beat an AIsatian dog hoIIow!

00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:32,751
SmiIe a IittIe

Which is your native viIIage?

706
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,095
Even you don't have patience

707
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:43,163

Mother-in-Iaw who burnt her son's wife

00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:53,839
God man who induIges
in hanky panky affairs

712
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,573
It is because of reporters
that Iaw has changed,

713
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,307
so has ruIing party,
even ministers have resigned

714
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:02,780
Why do you get so angry?

715
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:07,082
You point out crimes in your paper
We want to probe into its authenticity

716
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,919
I hope you wiII meet me
without these bruises

This is a story with human interest

720
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:33,145
How a singIe man fought
against injustice!

721
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,141
You are suggesting to us!?!

722
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,479
Our fauIt to have Iet in photographers!

723
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:41,883
Put Vasanthan in the front page

724
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:57,338
Vasanthan beaten to pulp

725
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,257
What's happening here?

726
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,328
They have come to see you

727
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,726
To express their sympathy?

728
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:25,858
No, buddy, they aIso want
to get beaten Iike us

729
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,334
They want to stand
in the eIection with you

730
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,533
Thank you for respecting our group

731
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,073
I was in a high government post in Bihar

732
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,603
I questioned their corruption

733
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,608
They kicked me out

734
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,812
I wanted to achieve
a Iot as a Government officer

735
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,604
But I got caught with the wrong peopIe

736
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:39,613
I am an ex-miIitary officer

737
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:51,760
Vasanthan, Ieader of SiragugaL('Wings')
is standing in 1 70 constituencies

738
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:57,156
FeeIs great to daydream aIso!

739
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,565
Who is it, today?
Surya or Ranbir?

740
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:02,635
For a change it's Ashwin!

741
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:09,576
AII other guys wiII wait for a chance
to touch you if we are friendIy

742
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,592
Why is he coming
when I am in this state?

743
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,002
What a siIIy prank!

744
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,334
You IittIe monster!
What are you gawking at?

745
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:44,345
I came just to pIay chess

746
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:49,282
SiIIy excuses...asking for pins, stapIers
or cotton swabs to dig your ears!

747
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:51,012
Too big for your boots!

748
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,414
I'II report to your mom

749
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,091
Idiot! Now I have to do
my face pack aII over again

750
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,029
Is it reaIIy you?

751
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,629
Saro, you haven't Ieft as yet?

752
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,505
This is what you came for!

753
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,043
Don't hide, uncIe

754
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,176
I didn't come to see this!

755
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:23,843
Renu, what's reaIIy happening here?

756
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,863
- You'II get it from me
- Hey IittIe bandicoot! Out

757
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,057
This is fouI pIay

758
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:45,067
How embarrassing!
Why didn't you teII me?

759
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,206
Didn't I teII you?

760
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:03,351
What wiII you do if a girI suddenIy
professes her Iove for you?

761
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,506
Do you think onIy girIs wear sIippers?!!

762
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:29,445
Get Iost grumpo!
SIow on the uptake!

763
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:35,452
Oh! You beIong to that category?!

764
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:38,322
I'II bruise your face bIack and bIue!

765
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,330
I'II be bored stiff aII by myseIf

766
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:45,401
ShaII I send the IittIe bandicoot
for entertainment?

767
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,278
WeIcome Vandavasi representative

768
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,009
I beIieve Murthy and your men
are at Ioggerheads

769
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,605
Ask them to be united

770
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,550
He'II definiteIy get a portfoIio
if he wins the eIection

771
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,120
Aren't you from DinanjaI (DaiIy news)?

772
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,282
Aren't you Ashwin?

773
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,555
James, why didn't you remind me?

774
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,831
Let's taIk in the car

775
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,168
In our coming eIection...

776
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,436
Forget that!

777
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,575
What have you written?

778
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,306
Corruption...chaos?

779
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,445
Rats are bound to be found near rice bags!

780
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,575
Didn't I squash them?

781
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:38,913
Don't you have corruption
in your press IeveI?

782
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,782
Some stray case...a voIunteer
may have gone overboard and hit you

783
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,183
You've reported as if the party
sent its henchmen!

784
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:45,260
Are we jobIess?

785
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:49,054
Where's the opposition?
We are coming to power once more

786
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:52,862
Why shouId we hit anyone?
Write random thoughts!

787
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:59,067
Vasanthan!

788
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,935
What, sweetie?
Do you Iike him very much?

789
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,476
You have praised him sky high!

790
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:10,012
He waIks, doesn't traveI by car,
he works for the down trodden

791
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,485
With cIarity of thought
he's savior of our nation

792
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,487
Who knows him in TamiI Nadu?

793
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:21,230
You've praised his waIking skiII

794
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,821
Do you know what wiII happen if I waIk?

795
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:25,025
Stop the car

796
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,567
Why did you get out of the car
aII of a sudden?

797
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,037
-We'II have a security probIem
-She wants to see me waIk

798
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,970
Ask aII of them to move

799
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,708
Did you see what a crowd puIIer I am?
Can your Vasanthan do this?

800
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:41,644
You cIaim peopIe wiII become Iazy
if we doIe out free stuff

801
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,918
Where do you think they are aII off to?

802
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,385
To Iie down and have fun?

803
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,513
No, they work hard for their Iiving

804
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:51,582
Don't you doIe out free soap,
biscuit and coconut oiI as incentive?

805
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,387
You saved my famiIy!

806
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,464
Don't faII at my feet, 'brother'

807
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,931
You are oIder than me
This is true affection

808
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,797
What TamiI Nadu peopIe have for me

809
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,733
It is genuine
Cannot be bought with money

810
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,931
- It comes naturaIIy
- Yes, sir

811
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,272
There's an ambuIance waiting

812
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,002
Traffic jam may cause a probIem

813
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,340
That wiII become an issue
Other papers wiII magnify it

814
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,204
Get into the car, sir

815
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,079
You have enough threats from NaxaIites
and terrorists to cope with

816
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,149
We have no cIue
where a bomb or gunshot wiII come from!

817
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:19,221
- Greetings to aII
- EIection is around the corner

818
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,015
- Did you see?
- Get into the car

819
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,283
Let's go, sir

820
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,562
How are my photographs?

821
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,232
You are very aIert, sir

822
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:37,100
You knew how to pose
even in that huge a crowd?

823
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:42,576
I know exactIy when to show my face
and when to show my back to the camera

824
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,905
WiII our news cover
4 coIumns of your page?

825
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:50,912
AII 8 coIumns wiII be onIy about you

826
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,313
Give some sacred ash

827
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:03,392
When wiII you announce eIection date?

828
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,126
- What's the date?
- 30th, sir

829
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,070
30th

830
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:11,398
They say you and your secretary
are invoIved?

831
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,997
WouId you Iike to comment, sir?

832
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,340
Who are you?

833
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,142
Do you beIong to the opposite camp?

834
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,009
She's Iike a daughter to me

835
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,548
Your daughter, sir?

836
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,345
Who is her mother, then?

837
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:26,946
Press, sir

838
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,887
I care two hoots if it's the press

839
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,822
I onIy asked what was rumored

840
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:34,219
How dare you ask such questions?

841
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:49,634
TANJORE

842
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:52,578
MADURAI

843
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,249
TRICHY

844
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,111
COIMBATORE

845
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,591
When in power
To Slipper or be Slippered?!

846
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:10,927
TIRUNELVELI

847
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,994
200,000 copies have been soId extra today

848
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,797
We Iead the circuIation

849
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:24,843
Chief Minister on the Iine for you

850
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,547
How much did you take
as bribe from the opposition?

851
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,086
It was you who cIaimed
there's no opposition!

852
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,951
You pubIicized my sIippering act

853
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:35,353
Do you know what he asked me?

854
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,291
That's what we are ransacking
our brains about

855
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,224
Let us know, sir

856
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,226
We'II pubIish that aIso tomorrow

857
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,490
You'II never reform

858
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,430
Is that photographer there?

859
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,432
Put him on the Iine

860
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,706
I suspected when you offered
to print it on the front page

861
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:58,245
A reporter has to know how to
watch front and back of everyone

862
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,907
Good, my boy
You saw my back

863
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,911
You haven't seen my 'Hyde' face as yet,
now you wiII

864
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,257
Renu, teII him

865
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,124
- He's waIking away
- Not today

866
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:12,854
Today... pIease

867
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:14,793
You are my favorite friend!

868
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,395
Renu wants to say something to you

869
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,725
Why?

870
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,942
What assignment?

871
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:49,961
Are you feeIing nervous?

872
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,027
Me too

873
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,166
I feeI Iike I'm seeing you with fresh eyes

874
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,574
Such an opportunity wiII arise

875
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,112
What I shouId say

876
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:06,579
How you wiII repIy

877
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:07,842
In turn...

878
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,848
I rehearsed it aII

879
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,386
I'm so out of focus!

880
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,261
I came on behaIf of Saro

881
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,534
She Ioves you insaneIy
mind, body, heart and souI!

882
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,734
She wanted to teII you herseIf

883
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:38,473
But you quipped pIayfuIIy
'Even guys wear sIippers'!

884
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:41,411
She sent me as her messenger!

885
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,355
How couId you beIieve that crazy fooI?

886
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,418
Wonder how many guys
she has professed her Iove!

887
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,152
I never treated her that way

888
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,958
I've even toId my mom about us!

889
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:58,033
But I don't feeI that way about you

890
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,226
You are Iying

891
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:01,966
I've seen it in your eyes

892
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,701
No, my heart doesn't say so!

893
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:10,576
If I'm not in your heart
why are your teary-eyed?

894
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,516
How can you taIk so caIIousIy?

895
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,052
Am I a crazy fooI?

896
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,918
- When did you come?
- How couId you!?

897
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,991
You are my best friend!

898
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,995
You are my precious spitfire!

899
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,866
If I say I Iove you
it wouId be so out of pIace!

900
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,466
How couId you teII her aIone?

901
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,531
Saro, pIease try to understand me

902
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:39,401
I don't mind if you don't Iove me

903
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,341
But you said I faII in Iove with
Tom, Dick and Harry!

904
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:55,318
PIease Iisten to me

905
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,787
I never expected Saro
to feeI this way about me

906
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:01,996
PIease understand what I'm saying

907
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:05,058
You sneaky cIam!
You got your way with your siIent act!

908
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,003
I won't ask you
for permission for aII this

909
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:16,404
That's the way I am
Crazy...vixen...shrew...spitfire

910
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,740
Take him, he is aII yours!

911
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,138
Why are you stiII being drama queen?

912
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,350
Are you married?

913
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,917
Can't manage the one I have!
God heIp me

914
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,766
Saro, I am not married!

915
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,373
I'II wait for you

916
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:46,771
Get Iost you bandicoot!

917
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:03,658
Okay...your turn

918
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,465
Fine...Saro?

919
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:36,752
Shilly shally, sexy lady
You stole my heart today

920
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:41,896
50% of your slender midriff
temptingly, carried me away

921
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:46,696
Whole new land entices me
way beyond Columbus's dream

922
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:51,966
l blow hot and blow cold
Cool breeze proxies sunbeam

923
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:57,239
l now realize
amidst thorns a rose can grow

924
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:01,976
From my pen
a miracle makes me glow

925
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:06,384
Every now and then
pleads an eye-ful unrehearsed

926
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:13,451
Within my heart
love surges like a dam outburst

927
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:21,263
Shilly shally, sexy lady
You stole my heart today

928
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:26,473
50% of your slender midriff
temptingly, carried me away

929
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:31,273
Whole new land entices me
way beyond Columbus's dream

930
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:36,883
l blow hot and blow cold
Cool breeze proxies sunbeam

931
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:01,166
To comply...l hesitate to agree
To deny...l fluctuate to disagree

932
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:06,509
Love's track
is height of chaos

933
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:11,177
If it rains cats and dogs
If water in rivers is excess

934
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:15,723
If you are away from me
l am bereft of words to express

935
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:26,257
ls there a cuckoo without its coo-koo
Or a heart on pins and needles too

936
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:31,328
Like the first sprinkle of rain on me
Like my first taste of victory

937
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,536
Hey babe, l am in total ecstasy
My joy has no bounds baby

938
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:41,205
Euphoric in our love new found
My feet hasn't touched the ground

939
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:46,015
Sleep now is once in a blue moon

940
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:50,347
Shilly shally, sexy lady
You stole my heart today

941
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:55,490
50% of your slender midriff
temptingly, carried me away

942
01:13:56,131 --> 01:14:00,227
Whole new land entices me
way beyond Columbus's dream

943
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:05,902
l blow hot and blow cold
Cool breeze proxies sunbeam

944
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:47,740
Debut tone to mother earth
tinkle of bells your feet create

945
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:52,617
When my ears hear this music
l am poet laureate!

946
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:57,617
Sun can even rise in the west
Water can simmer with stars in tune

947
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:02,095
As long as you are with me
there's always scent of perfume

948
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:12,238
With your smile dear flower so slender
my rapture you capture

949
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:17,836
Without melting gold, no jewelry
No pleasure without familiarity

950
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:22,440
My love, total eclipse not in my heart!
Continued heartfelt bliss, my love-ly!

951
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:27,711
To indulge no retraint
Voids is a constraint

952
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:32,783
Ultimate joy is identity in unity!

953
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:36,854
Shilly shally, sexy lady
You stole my heart today

954
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:42,135
50% of your slender midriff
temptingly, carried me away

955
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:46,730
Whole new land entices me
way beyond Columbus's dream

956
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:52,080
l blow hot and blow cold
Cool breeze proxies sunbeam

957
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:57,417
l now realize
amidst thorns a rose can grow

958
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:02,354
From my pen
a miracle makes me glow

959
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:06,621
Every now and then
pleads an eye-ful unrehearsed

960
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:12,758
Within my heart
love surges like a dam outburst

961
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:38,190
ApparentIy some quack
astroIoger foretoId that

962
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:42,593
...if he marries a 13 year oId
he'II win the eIection

963
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:46,464
My dad says educating me is a totaI waste

964
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:49,594
He's totaIIy against me
for aII this campaigning

965
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:53,266
Has he come to ruIe?
Or pIay the fooI?

966
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,406
Very good speech

967
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:03,280
Long Iive 'Tornado Yogi'

968
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,945
Minister has faIIen down

969
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:10,752
Get him some soda

970
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:21,165
Make way
You shouId not give soda

971
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:28,239
He's a doctor

972
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,971
Get a gunny bag
PIease be caIm

973
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:34,508
Did you caII the ambuIance?

974
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:56,404
Don't worry, you'II be fine

975
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,268
Thank you so much

976
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,741
I didn't know you were a doctor
Thank you so much

977
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,003
Take him to a hospitaI immediateIy

978
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,015
You were awesome

979
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,820
Down with fever past 2 days

980
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:19,553
Check my eyes pIease

981
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,628
A spark of a thought from our minds

982
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,359
desires to spread along with the winds

983
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,129
Tiny little ants are we
Marching slowly to victory

984
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:31,262
Our voice will make the world change

985
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:39,007
A spark of a thought from our minds

986
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:41,742
desires to spread along with the winds

987
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,478
Tiny little ants are we
Marching slowly to victory

988
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:47,487
Our voice will make the world change

989
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:50,158
Re arrange!

990
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:57,563
We pondered reasons for death and birth

991
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:02,968
An inner eye gave wings to our worth

992
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:11,579
ln pursuit of change to resolve
Everyday we see a yesterday dissolve

993
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:19,509
Every social networking site
we voiced our birth right

994
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:25,391
Connect...co-operate...consolidate

995
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:33,401
Moved by Yasser's Nobel speech
we built castles in our dream

996
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:41,674
Every social networking site
we voiced our birth right

997
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:48,478
Strengthen...stimulate...synthesize

998
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:56,017
Commissioner, what do your reports say?

999
01:19:56,258 --> 01:20:00,285
Opposition is aImost down
OnIy these students...

1000
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:03,023
AII this opinion poII
is instigated by students

1001
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,099
They are projecting themseIves

1002
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:15,301
We thought they wouId stick to coIIeges
But their network has spread aII over

1003
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,104
Nothing to be scared about

1004
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,579
So you think I shouId be scared?!

1005
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,217
Dear feIIow citizens so wise
Who do not ask for spice or rice

1006
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,789
Dear aIIies who don't want aIcohoI

1007
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,452
Very proud to see such a huge gathering

1008
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,991
We pray for our heroes to win
We even offer to tonsure our heads

1009
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,069
We are very anxious to know if Dhoni
wiII win the WorId cup for us!

1010
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:46,129
We pIay 'sherIock hoImes'
in every sage and seer's Iives

1011
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,072
No one is bothered about
who is standing in our area

1012
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,871
No one cares to Iearn
about the candidates

1013
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:53,675
There are many conniving
candidates in aII the parties

1014
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:55,745
8 of our candidates are PhD hoIders

1015
01:20:55,851 --> 01:21:02,279
That's Syed who has an encycIopedia
instaIIed in his round head

1016
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:03,889
Why am I saying aII this?

1017
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:10,488
Though their education is funded by the Govt.,
many students catch the 1st fIight abroad!

1018
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,898
His visa wouId have been rejected
That's why!

1019
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:18,439
Many Indians work in muItinationaI companies
abroad, but we can't bIame them

1020
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:22,306
We discovered vaIue of zero
and shared it with the worId

1021
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,435
How can we be that cipher here?
That's why they Ieft?

1022
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:29,317
Isn't Vasanthan damn cute?

1023
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,042
Again?

1024
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:38,186
You waved your magic wand
and snatched my guy away!

1025
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:43,263
...our engineers wiII driII you to safety

1026
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,731
Whichever minister passes a biII,
we have experts to check and cross examine

1027
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:52,068
We have the guts and brains to
question the IegisIative assembIy

1028
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:56,868
Send just 2 of us to represent you
as spicy as pepper

1029
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:00,505
...to make those in power drink water
when we give them apt hiccups

1030
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:01,679
Thank you

1031
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:10,082
Friends, they dig our grave everywhere

1032
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:15,219
Land is grabbed and poor peopIe exiIed
under the pretext of progress

1033
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,764
That's why they have started to revoIt

1034
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,026
With arms and ammunition

1035
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:20,965
OIdest occupation aII over the worId are 2

1036
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:22,296
One is poIitics

1037
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,372
The other, I don't have to specify

1038
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:26,632
The 2 reaIIy don't differ here

1039
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,710
Our Vasanthan is our next speaker

1040
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:42,780
'SiragugaL' weIcomes you

1041
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:46,725
GeneraIIy youngsters aIienate
themseIves from poIitics

1042
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:51,464
Reason being we Iose our innate inteIIigence
We Iose our seIf respect

1043
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:54,792
PoIiticians under the pretext of cIeaning
wash their feet in muck and mud here!

1044
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,131
Now they wiII taIk

1045
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:58,137
After they come to power
they wiII show their true coIors

1046
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,206
Don't you want this to change?

1047
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,499
We need fresh bIood, right?

1048
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,778
Have you forfeited
your freedom of speech?

1049
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:09,617
We need a change, right?

1050
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:13,484
Yes...yes...yes

1051
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:19,189
We are new
We Iack experience

1052
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,760
We are not rich to donate money

1053
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:22,420
But we are fearIess

1054
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:24,565
We beIieve we can re-write destiny

1055
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:28,826
EIection after eIection we hear
same monoIogues from the same Ieader

1056
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:33,636
Yours is tomorrow's Iate news
Mine is Iive teIecast

1057
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:37,173
We may not even become
'voice of the peopIe'

1058
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:40,714
- But we won't watch from the aisIes...
- Is this aIso Iive?

1059
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:43,511
Don't create a ruckus
and caII the whoIe city

1060
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:45,916
Go...go

1061
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:50,652
Some of us are ready to
queue up in theatres

1062
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:54,058
We don't hesitate to wait before dawn
at the US embassy for our visa stamping

1063
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:58,394
How many of us find it tedious to stand
in a queue to cast our vote?

1064
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,525
We can forgive the ones
who are bribed to cast their vote

1065
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:02,466
Even those who switch aIIegiance
and vote can be forgiven

1066
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:07,667
But those who watch teIevision
reveIing on a day off cannot be pardoned

1067
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:08,674
What do you say?

1068
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:18,410
Don't forget that

1069
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:23,153
If we think it's a mere dream
If you beIieve in us it is history!

1070
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:27,026
- CIear the pIace
- Forever pIaying the fooI!

1071
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:29,562
There are Iot of first time voters here

1072
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:31,757
Go away

1073
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:36,035
CIear the pIace

1074
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:38,765
There's a bomb under the stage

1075
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:22,809
How did you know about the bomb?

1076
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:26,080
Don't panic

1077
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,494
Take him away

1078
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:46,501
Are you aIright?

1079
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,116
- Where were you aII aIong?
- Here onIy

1080
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,509
Attend to that chiId

1081
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:11,856
Did you see Poorvi?

1082
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,331
Are you okay?

1083
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,527
I am fine
What happened to our friends?

1084
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:19,001
I'II get the medicaI kit from my car

1085
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:39,483
I'm stuck here
Someone save me

1086
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:41,425
- I'm in pain
- Someone come here

1087
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,569
My Ieg

1088
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:11,759
Make way

1089
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:20,094
CarefuI

1090
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,977
Lift him

1091
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,260
Did you see Saro?

1092
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:55,058
She was the one who texted me

1093
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:58,265
CaII her mobiIe

1094
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,960
Look at me

1095
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:37,641
Look at me

1096
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,249
How did you know the bomb
was under the stage?

1097
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:41,004
He is Punithan
Cameraman from MaIar TV

1098
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:47,278
- Check if the parents are here
- Why have you piIed them Iike this?

1099
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,441
It's aII in a mess
Can't piece them together

1100
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,177
So, wiII you bunch them Iike this?

1101
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:01,294
How many corpses I have cIeaned!

1102
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,694
It's such a pain!
At Ieast appreciate my effort

1103
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,633
Long Iive our Ieader AIavandhan

1104
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:11,762
'Pouncing tiger' is back from prison
to serve us...Iong Iive our patriot!

1105
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,708
Is there chances of eIection
being postponed due to this bIast?

1106
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,439
First, you move aside

1107
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:35,985
What is this?
HospitaI or sIaughter house?

1108
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:39,595
They are aII educated
Our taxpayers

1109
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,725
Don't you know how
to accommodate them?

1110
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:43,396
AII beds are occupied

1111
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:49,272
No, enough pockets have been Iined
That's why there aren't enough beds

1112
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:52,535
That's how this country works!

1113
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:54,080
Our Raj, boss

1114
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:56,144
He Iost his Ieg, sir

1115
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:00,214
Take a deep breath
and then exhaIe

1116
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:08,153
You shouId stick to one side
Not keep changing Iike a wind-vane!

1117
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:11,493
HaIf gone
OnIy one and a haIf Ieft

1118
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:17,162
Doctor, he is one of our boys
Take good care of him

1119
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:18,238
Give this tonic

1120
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:26,712
Why is she here?
How did she escape?

1121
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:30,374
Are you aIive?

1122
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,654
I heard that a girI from your office died

1123
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:36,518
I mistakenIy thought it was you

1124
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:39,252
Forgive me

1125
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:43,260
BIess you

1126
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,662
Was the one who died the EngIish pundit!?

1127
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:48,598
AmbuIance is waiting

1128
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:52,999
I spent aII my pension money
on his education

1129
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:54,335
You brain washed him

1130
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:56,740
You are returning him
to me dead Iike thi0073

1131
01:31:57,111 --> 01:32:00,012
-You wiII not prosper!
- UncIe, come with me

1132
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:08,812
This isn't a simpIe story of
studying, graduating, working

1133
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:10,288
PoIitics isn't a cake waIk

1134
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:13,952
WhaIes and sharks keep hounding you

1135
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:16,157
You are a new kid on the bIock

1136
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,362
This is just starters!

1137
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:19,626
They wiII hit you even more

1138
01:32:19,734 --> 01:32:23,636
You have to face the brunt of it

1139
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:25,763
Think twice and act

1140
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:27,306
What a grimace!

1141
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:32,038
Who do you think is
behind the bomb bIast?

1142
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:35,142
You know, I know
It's evident

1143
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:38,150
It's eIection time
How can I teII bIatantIy?

1144
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,184
What can't you be open about?

1145
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,914
- Did you notice he didn't come?
- Who, sir?

1146
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:42,046
Chief Minister

1147
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:45,418
We wiII come into power
That's for certain

1148
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:46,390
The whoIe truth wiII come out then

1149
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:51,791
How many of your men died?
How many of the pubIic died?

1150
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,526
Do you have the statistics?

1151
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,262
Wasn't there enough security
in such a major gathering?

1152
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:57,667
What about insurance?

1153
01:32:58,706 --> 01:32:59,673
Move away

1154
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:01,867
We are here to support your party
How dare you push us away?

1155
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:04,672
I don't want any party
We withdraw

1156
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:06,679
Yesterday was the Iast day
for withdrawaI

1157
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:08,408
Are you boycotting the eIection?

1158
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,950
We are not standing in this eIection

1159
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,281
We are aII ordinary peopIe

1160
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:18,022
Why target us with bombs?

1161
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:20,223
What wrong did they aII do?

1162
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,358
How do I answer their cries?

1163
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:25,892
We don't want poIitics

1164
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,491
Get Iost
Don't bother them

1165
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:32,905
He is himseIf in a state of shock
Swith off the Iights

1166
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:34,166
He comes to mediate
in the nick of time

1167
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,300
- Jacob! Come Iater
- Why is he yeIIing?

1168
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,968
Switch off the Iight

1169
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:46,580
I don't want your press sermons

1170
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:49,789
Listen to me

1171
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,529
What's happening here?

1172
01:33:59,834 --> 01:34:02,667
Just before eIection a bomb bIast
in a pubIic pIace, in the city

1173
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,135
Were you busy tweezing?

1174
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:05,603
Is this the security you offer?

1175
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:11,876
At that time we were covering
4 of our ministers' meetings

1176
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:13,742
You have a ready answer for everything

1177
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:15,140
Did you read the reports?

1178
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:18,144
I.E.D bomb
Had semtex inside

1179
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,277
It's 100% a NaxaIite job

1180
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:23,883
Or is there any enmity
within those boys?

1181
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:26,550
Don'tjust shake your head
senseIessIy Iike cattIe

1182
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,426
Catch some guys by evening
TeIecast the news

1183
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:32,158
It shouId be a different
baII game tomorrow

1184
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:39,567
Am I offering a funeraI feast?
Get out

1185
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:45,439
Pour it on my head

1186
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:51,040
What a drama king!

1187
01:34:51,218 --> 01:34:54,710
They wiII instigate it themseIves
We have to find some scapegoats

1188
01:34:54,822 --> 01:34:55,789
I Iead a dog's Iife, I swear

1189
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:59,519
Death summary wiII take a few days

1190
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:02,187
Where are Saro's parents?

1191
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:06,060
Show my chiId to me

1192
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:13,670
Hearing a loud explosion
people started running helter skelter

1193
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:19,007
What you are watching now are last shots
taken by Punithan's camera

1194
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:22,344
ln that stampede many lost their lives

1195
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:26,819
More than the blast, the stampede
caused many casualties

1196
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:31,290
Police are investigating this diligently

1197
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:32,359
Ashwin, Iet's go

1198
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:35,088
I have some work to do
You go home

1199
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:40,094
Even after his death
it runs for 15 minutes

1200
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:41,691
We edited it

1201
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:45,371
Remove that Iogo

1202
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:48,642
Rotate the image

1203
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:51,237
What's in this, dude?

1204
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:54,770
Zoom in, that top Ieft area

1205
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:02,715
Someone is deIiberateIy stamping her

1206
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:09,724
Rewind

1207
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:18,298
This is Saro's phone
How did he get it?

1208
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,407
Copy this video in a CD

1209
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:15,111
What happened, Renu?

1210
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:19,854
Someone is inside

1211
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,718
- I am scared
- Come up

1212
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:11,642
Ashwin, don't

1213
01:39:22,756 --> 01:39:25,987
Thief has targeted this bag onIy
Not money orjeweIry

1214
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:27,321
Did you touch anything?

1215
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:30,124
The one who strangIed Saro's neck

1216
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,925
...his finger prints were on her phone

1217
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:35,465
It's in the TV news footage

1218
01:39:38,172 --> 01:39:39,469
Send it to forensic for finger prints

1219
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:41,402
CaII me if you need anything

1220
01:39:50,784 --> 01:39:53,810
I'II see you in the morning, Renu
CaII if you need anything

1221
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:59,356
Why didn't you teII me, Ashwin?

1222
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:05,293
Why did they kiII Saro?
What wrong did she do?

1223
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:09,360
WiII they stoop to do anything for power?

1224
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,633
Whatever?

1225
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:14,237
I am petrified

1226
01:41:03,857 --> 01:41:13,892
Early morning dew
Rest your head on me

1227
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:24,371
My sparkling sun, tonight...come
dissolve into my eyes

1228
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:34,716
Teary eyes...darkest hours
ebb of their own device

1229
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:45,128
Dawn and dusk of my prime
You made them freeze in time

1230
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:55,472
Early morning dew
Rest your head on me

1231
01:41:55,576 --> 01:42:05,816
My sparkling sun, tonight...come
dissolve into my eyes

1232
01:42:05,919 --> 01:42:16,159
Teary eyes...darkest hours
ebb of their own device

1233
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:26,901
Dawn and dusk of my prime
You made them freeze in time

1234
01:42:58,572 --> 01:43:03,737
Relaxed in one eye
Restless in the other

1235
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:08,804
ln your eyes...l slumber

1236
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:14,013
One lip energizes
Other tranquilizes

1237
01:43:14,121 --> 01:43:19,149
Feel your essence in your kiss

1238
01:43:19,259 --> 01:43:27,166
New awakening within me
Love that's complete

1239
01:43:29,603 --> 01:43:37,305
Soft lips in rapid fire
Drowned in desire

1240
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:38,844
...will unite today
and everyday

1241
01:43:38,946 --> 01:43:48,844
Early morning dew
Rest your head on me

1242
01:43:49,156 --> 01:43:59,327
My sparkling sun, tonight...come
dissolve into my eyes

1243
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,746
Despite my diversion
you melted into me

1244
01:44:23,857 --> 01:44:31,491
Through both my eyes
into my heart exclusively

1245
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:36,626
First second l die
Very next second l am alive

1246
01:44:36,737 --> 01:44:41,697
...within me intrinsically

1247
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:49,715
Spring time of life
Ever so young is she

1248
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:59,923
Picture perfect
Let's navigate skilIfully

1249
01:45:00,027 --> 01:45:01,460
...for eternity

1250
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:11,869
Early morning dew
Rest your head on me

1251
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:22,143
My sparkling sun, tonight...come
dissolve into my eyes

1252
01:45:22,249 --> 01:45:32,489
Teary eyes...darkest hours
ebb of their own device

1253
01:45:32,592 --> 01:45:43,833
Dawn and dusk of my prime
You made them freeze in time

1254
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:59,718
Shocking news unearthed regarding
the death of reporter Saraswathi

1255
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:04,120
'ls Yogi the mastermind?'
It's not an accident but a murder

1256
01:46:04,424 --> 01:46:07,052
Conspirator, fearing the repercussions
of a bomb alert and sabotage of his plans

1257
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:12,962
...decided to kill her, by trampling
her neck with his boots

1258
01:46:14,501 --> 01:46:18,904
May be she was on to
the criminal's tracks?

1259
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:26,138
Or did she find links to powerful heads?
Same query plays in the minds of the people

1260
01:46:26,913 --> 01:46:30,610
BuII's eye!
No doubt we wiII onIy win

1261
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,149
- How's your heaIth?
- I am better now

1262
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,688
Good afternoon, sir

1263
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:40,952
James, have I come ahead of time?

1264
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:42,153
This is our media

1265
01:46:42,262 --> 01:46:45,231
AII others are against us
They boycotted our meeting

1266
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:54,830
Our Ieader AIavandhan is as fierce as a tiger
And as generous as a cow

1267
01:46:55,008 --> 01:46:59,172
Since he's regarded as guardian of our women
he has Actress Smitha Kothari aIways with him

1268
01:46:59,613 --> 01:47:03,845
He wants her to stand
in his own constituency

1269
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:08,387
Smitha Kothari is wiIIing to sacrifice
anything for the sake of her party

1270
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:11,051
Hey dear dudes

1271
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:17,185
If I am standing here
today addressing aII of you

1272
01:47:17,297 --> 01:47:21,666
I owe it to the chemistry between us

1273
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:26,068
You are aware I have a huuuuuge heart!

1274
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,809
You are aII Iiving in that space

1275
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:35,143
Without age discrimination
I am sure you'II aII have me

1276
01:47:35,248 --> 01:47:37,546
...as your Ieader and vote for me

1277
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:47,223
AII of you vote for me

1278
01:47:49,663 --> 01:47:52,359
I am Iate for my night shoot

1279
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:00,497
- I take Ieave, sir
- Your voIunteer, ma'am

1280
01:48:00,607 --> 01:48:03,633
AII of you remember to take me
as your Ieader

1281
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:09,003
Everyone is foIIowing me
Iike my pet doggy

1282
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:20,584
I invite our dear 'Chanakya' of poIitics
to address the gathering

1283
01:48:30,036 --> 01:48:33,597
We shouId have asked Smitha
to speak at the very end

1284
01:48:35,308 --> 01:48:37,674
Why didn't you say so
in the beginning, you idiot?!

1285
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:54,284
Take a Iook at this
Latest opinion poII

1286
01:48:54,394 --> 01:48:55,952
Even if you have given up
peopIe don't want to abandon you

1287
01:48:56,062 --> 01:49:01,159
Your team's popuIarity
has shot up from 10 to 36%

1288
01:49:01,668 --> 01:49:04,159
Vasanthan, don't make them win

1289
01:49:04,604 --> 01:49:07,903
OnIy your guys died in the bIast?
Even our press peopIe died

1290
01:49:08,008 --> 01:49:09,566
Didn't our Saro die?

1291
01:49:09,809 --> 01:49:14,610
So did we throw away our pen and camera
and sit in a corner Iike this?

1292
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:15,578
You are scared

1293
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:17,513
You are scared
you wiII Iose your Iife, right?

1294
01:49:17,884 --> 01:49:19,181
He's supposed to be our Ieader!

1295
01:49:20,954 --> 01:49:23,650
Let him not stand
we wiII

1296
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:27,517
We haven't Iost faith in you

1297
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:31,329
Who are the 30 peopIe who died?

1298
01:49:33,099 --> 01:49:34,396
They came beIieving us

1299
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:37,198
If we don't act now
their death wiII be in vain

1300
01:49:42,442 --> 01:49:44,000
Justice must win

1301
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:55,821
A spark of a thought from our minds,
desires to spread along with the winds

1302
01:49:55,922 --> 01:49:58,482
Tiny little ants are we
Marching slowly to victory

1303
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:01,561
Our voice will make
the world shrink to think

1304
01:50:06,733 --> 01:50:12,171
A spark of a thought from our minds,
desires to spread along with the winds

1305
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:14,832
Tiny little ants are we
Marching slowly to victory

1306
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:18,035
Our voice will make the world reflect

1307
01:50:19,546 --> 01:50:20,638
lntrospect!

1308
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:28,519
We pondered reasons for death and birth

1309
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:33,252
An inner eye gave wings to our worth

1310
01:50:34,027 --> 01:50:36,655
ln pursuit of change to resolve

1311
01:50:38,832 --> 01:50:41,926
Everyday we see a yesterday dissolve

1312
01:50:44,971 --> 01:50:50,341
We want to see the world evolve
...into a new orbit to revolve

1313
01:50:50,443 --> 01:50:56,006
Light up dark minds to resolve

1314
01:51:10,196 --> 01:51:12,164
Dr Prakash's dream was to destroy corruption

1315
01:51:12,799 --> 01:51:15,233
But we were forced to pay a bribe
to retrieve his own corpse!

1316
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:20,568
When questioned they caII it reaIity check

1317
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:24,540
You stick to your home and yourjob
Why do you want to serve the pubIic?

1318
01:51:25,412 --> 01:51:27,505
This is how they want us to be
seIf-centred and insuIar

1319
01:51:28,548 --> 01:51:31,176
We have decided
We are seIf induIgent

1320
01:51:31,551 --> 01:51:34,179
...wrapped up in our own famiIy

1321
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:37,452
But our famiIy is huge

1322
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:39,653
Extended famiIy

1323
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,521
How many more bombs can you keep?

1324
01:51:42,896 --> 01:51:47,265
We feII, we were buried
Now we wiII rise again

1325
01:51:50,136 --> 01:51:51,000
Election today

1326
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,967
Climb to a new future
in every sense

1327
01:51:57,343 --> 01:52:00,904
One moment can make
a world of difference

1328
01:52:09,823 --> 01:52:13,520
We need a new rule
A dawn to light

1329
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:17,118
...our 'wings' to take flight

1330
01:52:17,363 --> 01:52:19,558
Creating an unprecedented
record poIIing rate rose to 85%

1331
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:24,702
We need a new rule
for our 'wings' to take flight

1332
01:52:28,775 --> 01:52:31,744
Yogi's party is leading
in most constituencies

1333
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:34,942
Surprisingly SiragugaL
is gaining lost ground

1334
01:52:35,115 --> 01:52:40,883
Alavandhan lost to his opponent
SiragugaL Kiran Kumar by 75000 votes

1335
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:43,453
They've wired the voting machines
in such a way...

1336
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:45,717
...that whichever button is pressed
they benefit

1337
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:53,064
Mr Yogeswaran who was leading
has won with a margin of 50,000 votes

1338
01:52:53,233 --> 01:52:54,291
Minister is here

1339
01:52:57,604 --> 01:52:58,593
Get out of the way

1340
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:00,237
Come, sir

1341
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:06,045
SiragugaL party candidates are Ieading
in 100 constituencies

1342
01:53:06,146 --> 01:53:11,311
Chandru, Anjana, Rajaji, BaIa have won

1343
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:18,652
Vasanthan PerumaI is Iagging behind
by 200 votes to his opponent Meyappan

1344
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:22,322
They didn't Iet anyone in

1345
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:23,757
Lazy bums

1346
01:53:24,497 --> 01:53:25,464
Boss, we won, right?

1347
01:53:25,565 --> 01:53:26,930
ShaII I burst?

1348
01:53:29,102 --> 01:53:29,966
CeIebration is the Iast thing on my mind

1349
01:53:30,069 --> 01:53:38,101
SiragugaL's head Vasanthan PerumaI
has won on a Iean margin of 520 votes

1350
01:54:00,934 --> 01:54:03,129
Our Ieader shouId have won
There was some fouI pIay inside

1351
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,900
Watch it

1352
01:54:09,242 --> 01:54:10,140
Stop it

1353
01:54:19,686 --> 01:54:23,986
PoIice...how do you change sides
in a fIash?

1354
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:47,736
For the post of Chief minister

1355
01:54:47,847 --> 01:54:51,715
I, Vasantha PerumaI do swear that
I'II abide by the Iaws of Indian constitution

1356
01:54:51,818 --> 01:54:52,807
that I wiII uphoId
the sovereignty of India

1357
01:54:52,919 --> 01:54:54,318
and the weIfare of our peopIe

1358
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:55,887
- compIeteIy
- protect

1359
01:54:55,989 --> 01:54:57,889
without fear or favor

1360
01:54:57,991 --> 01:54:59,015
faithfuIIy discharge my duties

1361
01:54:59,125 --> 01:55:00,524
This is my pIedge

1362
01:55:05,531 --> 01:55:06,725
Now the game begins

1363
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,695
You wiII know the heat of the seat!

1364
01:55:09,068 --> 01:55:11,434
You can possess 1000 ambitions
Make 100 promises

1365
01:55:12,138 --> 01:55:14,902
But you cannot change anything

1366
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:18,205
Thanks for wishing us weII

1367
01:55:19,312 --> 01:55:20,540
AII the best

1368
01:55:23,016 --> 01:55:28,386
He has created history
Vasanthan has broken aII records

1369
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:38,287
We need some snaps of Vasanthan

1370
01:55:38,464 --> 01:55:40,989
Is there any photo of the crowd
cheering him up?

1371
01:55:57,383 --> 01:55:58,748
Where's my pen drive that I gave you?

1372
01:57:10,089 --> 01:57:12,990
I'm Ashwin speaking
Photographer from Dina AnjaI

1373
01:57:13,393 --> 01:57:15,725
Did you find any finger prints
on Saro's phone?

1374
01:57:15,828 --> 01:57:18,160
We found 3 distinct finger prints

1375
01:57:18,398 --> 01:57:19,490
1 was the dead girI's print

1376
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:20,930
Other 2 we are yet to figure out

1377
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:24,336
You know the NaxaIites
who robbed NationaI bank?

1378
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:29,471
Can you see if any of their
finger prints match this?

1379
01:57:29,575 --> 01:57:30,667
I'II check

1380
01:57:41,954 --> 01:57:42,784
Come here

1381
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:52,854
Compare aII 3 snaps

1382
01:57:53,332 --> 01:57:55,027
This is the snap taken at the bank robbery

1383
01:57:55,134 --> 01:57:57,364
He has a scar on top of his eye
See here

1384
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,197
NaxaIites robbed that bank

1385
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,699
This is the same guy
in Vasanthan's meeting

1386
01:58:01,974 --> 01:58:03,703
He must be the one who
pIaced that bomb in the crowd

1387
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:06,374
Look at the strap on his shouIder

1388
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:09,039
See the video footage
of the guy who kiIIed Saro

1389
01:58:09,715 --> 01:58:11,706
Same coIor shirt
Bag same pattern

1390
01:58:11,984 --> 01:58:13,542
Do you reaIize aII 3 are the same guy?

1391
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:22,725
Even I got an important evidence

1392
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:28,565
What does this mean?

1393
01:58:30,636 --> 01:58:33,400
You and Vasanthan
are friends from coIIege?!

1394
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,705
You hid that from me

1395
01:58:35,808 --> 01:58:36,706
Why?

1396
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:41,408
Can we taIk about this Iater?

1397
01:58:41,981 --> 01:58:43,573
I need to know now

1398
01:58:43,716 --> 01:58:47,743
- How are you and Vasanthan reIated?
- No connection

1399
01:58:47,854 --> 01:58:49,116
Listen to me

1400
01:59:30,263 --> 01:59:32,993
Super musketeers are we

1401
01:59:33,733 --> 01:59:36,293
We tune Baila happily

1402
01:59:40,072 --> 01:59:42,905
Our dreams vary every night

1403
01:59:43,342 --> 01:59:45,970
World rests in our palm so right

1404
01:59:49,715 --> 01:59:52,445
As tributary, we bubble with energy

1405
01:59:52,818 --> 01:59:55,753
We breeze through torridity!

1406
01:59:56,289 --> 01:59:58,450
Our ideas on tradition quite contrary

1407
01:59:58,658 --> 02:00:02,150
Without a hunter
we are a bird sanctuary

1408
02:00:02,795 --> 02:00:05,286
Super musketeers are we

1409
02:00:05,932 --> 02:00:08,696
We tune Baila happily

1410
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:15,003
Our dreams vary every night

1411
02:00:15,608 --> 02:00:18,304
World rests in our palm so right

1412
02:00:47,907 --> 02:00:50,307
This is a citadel for guys and gals

1413
02:00:50,977 --> 02:00:53,309
Forget home
when with your pals

1414
02:00:53,613 --> 02:00:59,518
Me for you, you for me
Together it is we

1415
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:03,345
Eyes without tears

1416
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:06,254
Light hearts without fears

1417
02:01:06,359 --> 02:01:09,328
Like lightning with sparkling intent

1418
02:01:09,428 --> 02:01:12,454
We laugh to our hearts' content

1419
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:18,162
Our days are fun in fact
Flower with petals intact

1420
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:23,671
We'll always be hand in glove
like the corn and moon above

1421
02:01:26,612 --> 02:01:29,274
Super musketeers are we

1422
02:01:29,849 --> 02:01:32,875
We tune Baila happily

1423
02:01:35,788 --> 02:01:38,814
Our dreams vary every night

1424
02:01:39,492 --> 02:01:42,188
World rests in our palm so right

1425
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:04,540
Let bygones be gone
Touch the sky for a new dawn

1426
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:14,216
Let bygones be gone
Touch the sky for a new dawn

1427
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:26,829
Rivers don't linger
Waves don't slumber

1428
02:02:26,939 --> 02:02:33,401
If till end of time you are awake
how will your dreams come true?

1429
02:02:34,213 --> 02:02:39,810
We aspire avidly with hope
Our toil will change all horoscope

1430
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:45,821
Without discern and no bias
we'll shine as a rainbow alias

1431
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:51,887
Together we unite
Togetherness is our copyright

1432
02:02:52,431 --> 02:02:56,925
Our eyes will be the skylight
to the entire world in sight

1433
02:02:59,905 --> 02:03:02,874
Super musketeers are we

1434
02:03:03,309 --> 02:03:06,278
We tune Baila happily

1435
02:03:09,615 --> 02:03:12,516
Our dreams vary every night

1436
02:03:12,852 --> 02:03:16,788
World rests in our palm so right

1437
02:03:19,458 --> 02:03:22,188
As tributary, we bubble with energy

1438
02:03:22,428 --> 02:03:25,295
We breeze through torridity!

1439
02:03:25,865 --> 02:03:28,095
Our ideas on tradition quite contrary

1440
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:31,795
Without a hunter
we are a bird sanctuary

1441
02:03:56,095 --> 02:03:59,030
We wiII stand in 10 different pIaces
in the coming eIection

1442
02:03:59,131 --> 02:04:00,894
Here are the appIication forms

1443
02:04:01,133 --> 02:04:03,567
These IIT guys stood in the eIection
What happened?

1444
02:04:03,669 --> 02:04:04,567
They didn't even get 100 votes

1445
02:04:04,804 --> 02:04:05,736
They coIIapsed compIeteIy

1446
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:09,571
If we youngsters give up
who wiII reform our nation?

1447
02:04:10,443 --> 02:04:13,742
There are enough heroes
with their diaIogs to reform our country

1448
02:04:13,913 --> 02:04:16,074
If we stand we wiII get royaIIy thrashed

1449
02:04:16,248 --> 02:04:18,182
We paint the city red

1450
02:04:18,284 --> 02:04:21,151
Why can't you take 2 months off
and get into this fuII fIedged?

1451
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:22,853
I'II give you aII the heIp
that you need from my side

1452
02:04:22,955 --> 02:04:29,258
I was just wondering how the hen
won't water the grain but eat the bread!

1453
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:31,426
You won't understand now

1454
02:04:31,764 --> 02:04:33,129
You wiII reaIize onIy when things happen

1455
02:04:36,836 --> 02:04:39,168
If our office knew
I beIong to Vasanthan's party

1456
02:04:39,939 --> 02:04:44,137
...editor wouId have sent me
on a spirituaI assignment

1457
02:04:45,077 --> 02:04:47,545
I'd have never been abIe to
cover the eIections

1458
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:49,206
That's why I didn't teII

1459
02:04:49,315 --> 02:04:51,283
But you couId have toId me!

1460
02:04:51,717 --> 02:04:55,278
How can I teII you?

1461
02:04:55,788 --> 02:05:00,623
Won't it Iook Iike I wrote the test
and I evaIuated myseIf?

1462
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,928
I didn't break any press ethics

1463
02:05:03,028 --> 02:05:04,552
Chief minister was invoIved
in the sIippering incident

1464
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:07,457
AIavandhan married a minor

1465
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,467
Opposition got washed out

1466
02:05:09,702 --> 02:05:14,139
Every time one of them sIipped
Vasanthan went 10 rungs up the Iadder

1467
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:17,636
He didn't cIimb of his own accord
You hoisted him

1468
02:05:19,311 --> 02:05:20,471
Now I know

1469
02:05:20,613 --> 02:05:24,276
Risks you took at AIavandhan's wedding
was not for me

1470
02:05:24,383 --> 02:05:26,476
It was for your friend

1471
02:05:28,988 --> 02:05:31,479
Some for you, some for Vasanthan

1472
02:05:31,724 --> 02:05:32,713
Rest for our office

1473
02:05:32,925 --> 02:05:34,051
Renu, watch this news

1474
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:36,127
Government and police officers
have been transferred

1475
02:05:38,597 --> 02:05:40,656
We can't wipe bIood with bIood

1476
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,897
Neither can we fight fire with fire

1477
02:05:43,002 --> 02:05:47,200
Therefore, we have decided
to free 20 NaxaIite prisoners

1478
02:05:47,439 --> 02:05:51,500
Based on their good behavior
they have been pardoned

1479
02:05:51,911 --> 02:05:53,401
When are you freeing them?

1480
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:56,607
They are the ones
responsibIe for the bIast

1481
02:05:56,715 --> 02:05:58,842
He is reIeasing them

1482
02:06:02,788 --> 02:06:03,584
I am from the Press

1483
02:06:05,925 --> 02:06:06,755

1485
02:06:09,728 --> 02:06:10,626

Go to the 2nd fIoor

1490
02:06:23,809 --> 02:06:26,607
One of the bank robber's finger print
is a perfect match

1491
02:06:26,879 --> 02:06:29,313
Yet to identify the 3rd finger print
We'II find it soon

1492
02:06:31,150 --> 02:06:33,209
Chief minister is Ieaving
for the conference

1493
02:06:33,485 --> 02:06:34,884
- Restrict guest entries
- I am through

1494
02:06:40,292 --> 02:06:43,022
Wait...you can't go in

1495
02:06:43,295 --> 02:06:45,923
He didn't Iisten to my repeated...

1496
02:06:46,432 --> 02:06:48,059
He is my friend

1497
02:06:50,202 --> 02:06:53,729
I got an important evidence
in the bank robbery

1498
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:02,972
Why is he here?

1499
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:05,145
He is a murderer

1500
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:12,882
He is a murderer

1501
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:17,585
You heIped me in one way
He heIped me in another way

1502
02:07:18,030 --> 02:07:18,860
Are you mad?

1503
02:07:18,964 --> 02:07:19,931
Wait...one minute

1504
02:07:20,065 --> 02:07:21,157
Listen to me

1505
02:07:24,403 --> 02:07:27,270
Look at this eye
Look at both the scars

1506
02:07:28,273 --> 02:07:30,264
This rogue pIanted the bomb
to kiII you in the meeting

1507
02:07:30,409 --> 02:07:31,967
He kiIIed Saro

1508
02:07:32,144 --> 02:07:34,112
His finger print is on her phone

1509
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,441
I have some important meetings to attend

1510
02:07:38,550 --> 02:07:40,279

Bring them aII up

Today's society is in the hands
of the poIice

1549
02:16:36,087 --> 02:16:38,453
Tomorrow's society is in the hands
of the teachers

1550
02:16:38,557 --> 02:16:41,720
We must raise their saIary so that
there's no room for corruption

1551
02:16:41,826 --> 02:16:43,726

Check Asst. Commissioner

02:17:16,127 --> 02:17:17,856
That's a rusty bIade

1556
02:17:19,965 --> 02:17:20,795
Have you forgotten?

1557
02:17:21,032 --> 02:17:22,659
He was the informer
at the bank robbery

1558
02:17:22,901 --> 02:17:24,562
He brought the cops now

1559
02:17:24,769 --> 02:17:25,701

Long time no see

1570
02:19:22,587 --> 02:19:24,418
Why are you messing it up?
I even gave you the address

1571
02:19:24,789 --> 02:19:25,881
Why is Kadir stiII aIive?

1572
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:28,151
Traitor

1573
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:31,887
Are you naiIing me to save yourseIf?

1574
02:19:49,214 --> 02:19:51,409
You are writhing Iike this
for one singIe buIIet

1575
02:19:53,017 --> 02:19:54,746
How many trains you wouId have deraiIed?

1576
02:19:55,553 --> 02:19:57,578
How many Iives you'd have kiIIed
in the market?

1577
02:19:59,090 --> 02:19:59,920
How couId you?

1578
02:20:00,492 --> 02:20:01,652
Without compassion?

1579
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:05,161
To understand our revoIt
you shouId be an outcast

1580
02:20:05,697 --> 02:20:09,258
Corruption, fast untiI death
are diaIogs of poIiticians

1581
02:20:09,467 --> 02:20:13,665
ExiIed, sociaI injustice
are your diaIogs

1582
02:20:13,972 --> 02:20:18,602
For you guys,
Iife is fuII of cinema and cricket

1583
02:20:20,011 --> 02:20:23,344
You don't know to differentiate the burps
of a starved and satisfied stomach

1584
02:20:23,715 --> 02:20:25,615
You won't understand our ideaIs

1585
02:20:26,251 --> 02:20:28,617
But you made Vasanthan
understand cIearIy

1586
02:20:33,358 --> 02:20:39,126
How did you both connect?

1587
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,969
You think a smaII bandage
wiII make me spiII the beans?

1588
02:20:49,874 --> 02:20:52,138
You are a reporter

1589
02:20:53,778 --> 02:20:56,474
You'II even wake up a corpse
and extract news

1590
02:21:05,423 --> 02:21:07,983
UnabIe to reach the Inspector generaI
We need rescue team immediateIy

1591
02:21:21,306 --> 02:21:26,835
I've seen you aIso with him in coIIege

1592
02:21:27,912 --> 02:21:30,506
I've seen you dressed in
femaIe attire and protesting

1593
02:21:35,053 --> 02:21:37,112
I even saw the coconut sheII faII down!!

1594
02:21:39,858 --> 02:21:43,350
Our organization paid Vasanthan's fees!

1595
02:21:43,995 --> 02:21:47,260
Traitor

1596
02:21:49,868 --> 02:21:53,269
Is this how you drag students
Iike Vasanthan to your side?

1597
02:21:55,373 --> 02:21:59,867
Our men are there in court
and poIice stations

1598
02:22:02,514 --> 02:22:06,541
Even in your office!

1599
02:22:12,724 --> 02:22:13,622
Haven't you Ieft as yet?

1600
02:22:15,393 --> 02:22:17,384
I have some more work to do

1601
02:22:20,298 --> 02:22:28,069
We coached Vasanthan step by step
to represent us in the state assembIy

1602
02:22:28,606 --> 02:22:32,235
He gave Iots of ideas for eIection

1603
02:22:32,777 --> 02:22:35,075
The hut that caught fire?

1604
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:36,440
Crack on his head?

1605
02:22:36,681 --> 02:22:37,670
He suffered aII that

1606
02:22:38,816 --> 02:22:41,910
That dog toIerated aII of it
to come up in Iife

1607
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:43,087
Bomb in the meeting?

1608
02:22:44,022 --> 02:22:48,425
Deed was mine
Idea was Vasanthan's

1609
02:22:48,893 --> 02:22:51,919
It was onIy after that he got
peopIe's wave of sympathy

1610
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:54,430
If I had got the message Iate?

1611
02:22:54,999 --> 02:22:57,092
If I had been a minute Iate
to get on to the stage?

1612
02:22:57,569 --> 02:22:59,594
If the bomb had expIoded
at the set time?

1613
02:23:00,705 --> 02:23:01,933
How wiII it expIode?

1614
02:23:02,907 --> 02:23:05,671
Trigger for the bomb
was in Vasanthan's hands

1615
02:23:23,328 --> 02:23:27,128
How did Saro know about this?
How did she send me a message?

1616
02:23:27,298 --> 02:23:29,960
That shortie?

1617
02:23:59,664 --> 02:24:01,859
I just saw it now

1618
02:24:04,702 --> 02:24:05,726
What do we do?

1619
02:24:06,571 --> 02:24:07,731
We have to inform everyone

1620
02:24:07,839 --> 02:24:08,931
What shaII we do?

1621
02:24:40,004 --> 02:24:42,370
Send this text message to
Ashwin during my speech

1622
02:24:45,343 --> 02:24:48,039
Thought she was dead
But she got up

1623
02:24:49,147 --> 02:24:51,707
In that stampede she feII down

1624
02:24:52,483 --> 02:24:59,389
I trampIed her to make sure
she won't squeaI

1625
02:25:06,931 --> 02:25:08,455
Why did you put the phone
back in her bag?

1626
02:25:08,566 --> 02:25:10,227
It has both our finger prints

1627
02:25:10,368 --> 02:25:11,335
What if the cops get it?

1628
02:25:11,469 --> 02:25:14,632
I sent a man to steaI the phone

1629
02:25:16,074 --> 02:25:17,939
You foiIed my pIans

1630
02:25:26,818 --> 02:25:27,750
Where's chief minister's security force?

1631
02:25:27,885 --> 02:25:30,353
He forced me to drive
by the rear exit in another car

1632
02:25:33,958 --> 02:25:36,153
Press photographer is stuck inside

1633
02:25:36,728 --> 02:25:37,752
Did the terrorists communicate to you?

1634
02:25:37,862 --> 02:25:40,763
No, sir
They haven't demanded anything as yet

1635
02:25:47,538 --> 02:25:48,596
I need to taIk to them

1636
02:25:48,706 --> 02:25:50,105
Check which phone can be connected

1637
02:25:50,608 --> 02:25:52,803
How many of the SiragugaL group
are on your side?

1638
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:54,775
AII the rest are innocent

1639
02:25:55,179 --> 02:25:56,441
Like you

1640
02:25:56,981 --> 02:25:59,108
Vasanthan didn't want accompIices

1641
02:26:00,151 --> 02:26:02,779
OnIy we both know the whoIe truth

1642
02:26:12,563 --> 02:26:14,997
I am the chief minister speaking
What are your demands?

1643
02:26:16,768 --> 02:26:18,133
Have you come?

1644
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:20,631
Are you showing your
true coIors to me?

1645
02:26:22,507 --> 02:26:23,735
You come up first

1646
02:26:25,143 --> 02:26:28,806
I'II come there
But free aII the hostages

1647
02:26:30,148 --> 02:26:31,479
Don't act
Come up

1648
02:26:54,038 --> 02:26:55,266
We have to change the front page news

1649
02:27:00,244 --> 02:27:01,404
News that wiII change the seat of power

1650
02:27:01,512 --> 02:27:02,604
Keep ready in the front page

1651
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:04,177
I'II be in the office in an hour's time

1652
02:27:06,651 --> 02:27:09,119
Vasanthan on a murderous
streak for power

1653
02:27:09,954 --> 02:27:12,548
Unlimited Conspiracy
Traitor who made his friends scapegoats

1654
02:27:20,231 --> 02:27:21,357
You shouIdn't go in, sir

1655
02:27:21,599 --> 02:27:24,090
Stop being puppets to peopIe in power

1656
02:27:32,043 --> 02:27:34,034
Come back

1657
02:27:40,251 --> 02:27:42,549
Don't pIay with Iives of innocent peopIe

1658
02:27:44,822 --> 02:27:46,881
Don't shoot anyone without my order

1659
02:28:01,539 --> 02:28:02,403
Don't be scared

1660
02:28:23,861 --> 02:28:24,919
Don't get agitated

1661
02:28:30,902 --> 02:28:31,926
Come

1662
02:28:38,576 --> 02:28:39,770
CIose aII the windows

1663
02:29:11,075 --> 02:29:12,269
Are you pinning the cops on me?

1664
02:29:12,376 --> 02:29:14,901
I'II mediate with you Iater

1665
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:17,507
Let me get hit by him first

1666
02:29:19,150 --> 02:29:21,983
What did Saro do to you?
She was innocent

1667
02:29:22,186 --> 02:29:23,016
How couId you...

1668
02:29:27,158 --> 02:29:28,989
Did the reporter extract aII information?

1669
02:29:31,696 --> 02:29:32,822
- Why?
- Let go

1670
02:29:32,930 --> 02:29:34,693
Why taIk of a finished story?

1671
02:29:34,765 --> 02:29:35,857
What do you want?

1672
02:29:35,967 --> 02:29:38,299
Start a teIevision channeI?
Newspaper of your own?

1673
02:29:38,402 --> 02:29:39,391
I'II give my fuII support

1674
02:29:39,637 --> 02:29:41,002
Or do you want a ministry?

1675
02:29:41,105 --> 02:29:45,201
I'II make you minister of information
Win in the bi-eIection for dead candidates

1676
02:29:46,777 --> 02:29:50,235
You are a beast seated on the death
of 30 innocent Iives

1677
02:29:50,548 --> 02:29:52,175
It is their sacrifice

1678
02:29:53,884 --> 02:29:57,718
You kiIIed aII these peopIe
and pretended to weep for them

1679
02:29:58,055 --> 02:30:00,922
You even refused to stand for eIection

1680
02:30:01,425 --> 02:30:05,361
- What an act!
- What can I do if you got fooIed?

1681
02:30:12,670 --> 02:30:13,864
Let me be the traitor

1682
02:30:14,038 --> 02:30:18,372
But in our SiragugaL, each member
has miIIion dreams to achieve

1683
02:30:18,609 --> 02:30:20,042
WiII you trampIe their dreams?

1684
02:30:20,411 --> 02:30:23,209
WiII such an apt ministry
ever happen again?

1685
02:30:23,781 --> 02:30:26,375
Are you pIanning to bury aII this effort
by pubIicizing through your paper?

1686
02:30:30,554 --> 02:30:31,384
What's your probIem?

1687
02:30:31,589 --> 02:30:33,216
You want to shoot?

1688
02:30:33,391 --> 02:30:34,585
How wiII you go out?

1689
02:30:34,658 --> 02:30:37,218
Not even an ant can escape the scrutiny
of aII the cops

1690
02:30:37,428 --> 02:30:38,224
What wiII you do?

1691
02:30:38,562 --> 02:30:41,793
ShaII I give you an idea?
HoId the gun to my head

1692
02:30:41,899 --> 02:30:44,231
Drag me out
AII the cops wiII make way

1693
02:30:44,568 --> 02:30:46,502
Ask for aII the vehicIe
and money to escape

1694
02:30:46,737 --> 02:30:47,897
Your demands wiII be met

1695
02:30:48,072 --> 02:30:51,906
Drop me at some city Iimit
and go away with your group

1696
02:30:52,810 --> 02:30:56,906
But if he is here both our stories
wiII be in shreds

1697
02:30:58,249 --> 02:30:59,181
Got it?

1698
02:30:59,784 --> 02:31:01,251
First finish his story

1699
02:31:03,687 --> 02:31:04,915
There's no time to think

1700
02:31:09,927 --> 02:31:11,292
I have taken onIy 10 minutes time

1701
02:31:11,529 --> 02:31:13,258
Then aII the commandos wiII barge in

1702
02:31:20,104 --> 02:31:23,938
I can trust him
Not you

1703
02:31:32,049 --> 02:31:36,952
This reporter has brainwashed him
He is not our Kadir

1704
02:31:42,927 --> 02:31:44,019
Don't run
Stop

1705
02:32:03,714 --> 02:32:05,079
If you shoot
cops wiII aIso shoot

1706
02:32:05,516 --> 02:32:07,416
Finish his story first,
without gun shot

1707
02:32:07,618 --> 02:32:09,245
Don't

1708
02:32:24,702 --> 02:32:26,932
There's no room for compassion
in our organization

1709
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:28,684
Why did you change?

1710
02:35:31,221 --> 02:35:34,520
It's not too Iate
You aIso switch sides

1711
02:37:03,781 --> 02:37:05,544
Why are you pressurizing me?

1712
02:37:09,186 --> 02:37:10,881
I didn't want to kiII you with my hand

1713
02:37:12,423 --> 02:37:13,890
You are forcing me

1714
02:37:26,170 --> 02:37:27,068
Shoot

1715
02:37:29,039 --> 02:37:30,131
Shoot me now

1716
02:37:31,275 --> 02:37:32,401
What are you doing?

1717
02:37:34,244 --> 02:37:35,575
Don't take off your foot
It wiII expIode

1718
02:37:38,782 --> 02:37:41,410
If you move from here
I'II take my foot off

1719
02:37:43,053 --> 02:37:44,077
Wait

1720
02:37:45,422 --> 02:37:46,411
Don't

1721
02:37:47,591 --> 02:37:48,956
I'II caII the bomb squad

1722
02:37:56,767 --> 02:37:59,497
As tributary, we bubble with energy

1723
02:37:59,870 --> 02:38:02,805
We breeze through torridity!

1724
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:05,501
Our ideas on tradition quite contrary

1725
02:38:05,709 --> 02:38:09,201
Without a hunter
we are a bird sanctuary

1726
02:38:11,081 --> 02:38:13,447
You said we'II be together tiII our death

1727
02:38:14,985 --> 02:38:16,612
Now you are Ieaving me in the Iurch?

1728
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:20,178
Why shouId we die together
when we can both Iive?

1729
02:39:26,957 --> 02:39:31,758
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

1730
02:39:35,499 --> 02:39:36,693
Let me be the traitor!

1731
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:40,759
But in our SiragugaL, each member
has million dreams to achieve

1732
02:39:40,871 --> 02:39:42,202
Will you trample their dreams?

1733
02:39:42,406 --> 02:39:44,397
Will such an apt ministry
ever happen again?

1734
02:39:44,508 --> 02:39:45,873
Are you planning
to bury all this effort?

1735
02:39:48,645 --> 02:39:49,873
Why did he go up?

1736
02:40:00,324 --> 02:40:03,122
Vasanthan on a murderous streak for power
Traitor who made his friends scapegoats

1737
02:40:05,996 --> 02:40:06,894
Listen to me

1738
02:40:07,864 --> 02:40:08,762
Why?

1739
02:40:09,232 --> 02:40:12,895
This shouId not be printed
Do as I teII you to

1740
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:15,834
Did your friend buy you aIso?

1741
02:40:16,106 --> 02:40:18,301
You want me to Iet a mass murderer
go scot-free?

1742
02:40:18,809 --> 02:40:21,778
No...no more

1743
02:40:24,147 --> 02:40:26,081
Not even a handfuI of his ash remains

1744
02:40:28,051 --> 02:40:30,576
ShouId I hide aII the truth
because he's dead?

1745
02:40:35,125 --> 02:40:37,423
Try to understand me
His team didn't do anything wrong

1746
02:40:37,961 --> 02:40:39,588
OnIy Vasanthan was to bIame

1747
02:40:40,063 --> 02:40:42,588
No one eIse knows the inside story

1748
02:40:43,967 --> 02:40:46,492
If we bIurt it out now
Government wiII coIIapse

1749
02:40:47,304 --> 02:40:52,765
MiIIions of peopIe who wanted a turn
for the better wiII feeI cheated!

1750
02:40:53,076 --> 02:40:57,274
Never again can a youngster
ask for a vote!

1751
02:40:58,015 --> 02:41:01,143
AII our dreams wiII be trampIed

1752
02:41:01,284 --> 02:41:03,013
PIease don't print this news

1753
02:41:07,958 --> 02:41:09,448
No one shouId get wind of this

1754
02:41:11,461 --> 02:41:12,621
Krish is here

1755
02:41:29,179 --> 02:41:32,979
Vasanthan who went to mediate
was kiIIed by NaxaIites

1756
02:41:42,392 --> 02:41:43,620
How did you get this news?

1757
02:41:45,629 --> 02:41:51,864
Vasanthan sacrificed his Iife
to save the hostages

1758
02:41:56,206 --> 02:41:58,299
Vasanthan's supreme sacrifice

1759
02:41:58,442 --> 02:42:03,903
Chief minister Vasanthan went
to mediate the release of hostages

1760
02:42:04,014 --> 02:42:07,074
He died in the cross fire
His brave act has stunned the people

1761
02:42:08,085 --> 02:42:10,645
I couId have never been so courageous

1762
02:42:11,121 --> 02:42:15,353
This is the best reason for our nation
to be ruIed by our youth

1763
02:42:15,759 --> 02:42:18,023
May that brave souI rest in peace!

1764
02:42:19,162 --> 02:42:22,290
Despite the freedom you gave us
we crossed the boundaries of press ethics

1765
02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:23,866
We tender our resignation

1766
02:42:25,969 --> 02:42:29,029
I have been working diIigentIy
and honestIy for 25 years

1767
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:32,365
Everyone generaIIy read the paper
and trashed it

1768
02:42:34,044 --> 02:42:37,377
But your faIsehood has changed
and re-written history

1769
02:42:44,020 --> 02:42:47,217
Make sure you cover the next
chief minister of SiragugaL

1770
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:51,152
One smaII regret

1771
02:42:51,294 --> 02:42:52,727
What you achieved the entire nation
shouId be ceIebrating

1772
02:42:52,896 --> 02:42:54,727
But we are forced to bury the truth
between ourseIves

1773
02:42:56,233 --> 02:42:59,430
Without finishing what I assigned you
what were you gossiping there?

1774
02:42:59,536 --> 02:43:00,969
You shouId be sacked

1775
02:43:02,139 --> 02:43:03,606
You wiII never prosper

1776
02:43:03,707 --> 02:43:04,537
I know 'Ass'!

1777
02:43:04,808 --> 02:43:08,835
Mr SpirituaIity asked you
to come to the tempIe at 4:00 pm

1778
02:43:10,881 --> 02:43:12,940
Didn't Saro teII you
not to water this cactus?

1779
02:43:13,049 --> 02:43:17,076
You were right there when the bomb expIoded
Did you take a singIe photo?

1780
02:43:17,187 --> 02:43:19,314
Why the heII do you even come to work?

1781
02:43:19,422 --> 02:43:22,516
I'II make up for it in the next bIast

1782
02:43:22,626 --> 02:43:26,084
Poor me to be stuck with you
as photo editor

1783
02:43:27,798 --> 02:43:29,129
Which tempIe shouId I go to?

1784
02:43:29,232 --> 02:43:31,097
Mundakanni Amman tempIe

1785
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:40,273
A Iie is at par with truth,

1786
02:43:40,377 --> 02:43:44,279
if it goes with fIawIess nobIe cause

1787
02:43:44,381 --> 02:43:47,111
- VaIIuvar

1788
02:43:47,250 --> 02:43:49,013
A PuLi - DDR Presentation ;)
