Late as usual?

35
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,855
Okay-

36
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,055
Don't you have sense?

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,055
Move back!

38
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,215
Ananya is getting married.
Last chance, hug her.

39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,895
How did it go about?
-My family arranged it.

40
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,935
The guy is from US.

41
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,135
That's the end!

42
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,535
Welcome buddy, we are here.
-Thank you, buddy.

43
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,255
How much?

44
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,895
Hi, Bhavani! How are you?

45
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,095
Who are you?
-Prabhu.

46
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,535
I took you for Dilwale Dulhania
Le Jayenge last week.

47
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,175
I danced with you
for Kajol's song.

48
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,895
Who is he?
The gas supplier, right?

49
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,335
This is Adi, aunty.
Vasudevan from Chennai?

50
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,295
Uncle Ganapathy's friend?
His younger brother.

51
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,415
He'll be staying in your
guest room as your paying guest.

52
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,215
Are you his wife?
-No, who will marry Adi?

53
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,575
What did you say your name was?
-Adithya Varadarajan.

54
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,135
I'm Vasu's younger brother.
-Was the train late?

55
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,855
No, the car was late.

56
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,255
There are some conditions.
-Vasu told me.

57
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,295
What did he say?

58
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,815
That you're very strict
and I must pay rent on time.

59
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,375
The room must be clean,
no late nights...

60
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,095
...loud music,
smoking and partying.

61
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,695
But...
-My friend told me the rest.

62
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,495
Aunty is a famous
carnatic singer.

63
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,655
I shouldn't praise her
using Madras slang.

64
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,335
I'm not getting the right number.
-Try, Bhavani, you'll get through.

65
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,175
What else did he say?

66
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,895
He said that Aunty Bhavani
is the gem between the two of you.

67
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,175
Ananya said you're not friendly.
-You got me in trouble too.

68
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,775
He is hyper, uncle.

69
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,775
I don't know if I should
laugh or send you out.

70
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,175
Uncle!
-He's just kidding, uncle.

71
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,295
I'm giving you the
room because of Vasu.

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,335
He worked for me in the bank.
I'll give you one month.

73
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,135
If you're good, you get the room.
Or you have to leave.

74
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,015
Okay, sir.

75
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,055
We are trapped,
he has started his show.

76
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,775
Tamil sentiment.
Touch his feet, don't be shy.

77
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,735
Local game for local kids.
-Are you taking me for a ride?

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,535
The game starts
in a local train.

79
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,895
There is a killer.

80
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,975
And there is a victim.

81
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,255
We're caught between them...

82
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,375
---Player.

83
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,095
The victim falls...

84
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,375
...on the player's hand.

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,575
The victim has a bag.

86
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,015
There is a gun.

87
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,615
And a mobile phone.

88
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,215
Half torn Rs500 note.

89
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,775
Two Mumbai.

90
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,855
One Upper Mumbai.
Colour, glamour...

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,295
...fashion shows, discotheques,
Bollywood and...

92
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,895
...rich men.
Fast cars, big boats...

93
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,415
...pretty girls and bikinis.

94
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,655
Two, Lower Mumbai.

95
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,575
Hawala, contract killers,
black money, opium, drugs.

96
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,895
Game starts in Upper Mumbai.
We go below.

97
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,135
When we try to answer a call,
we get caught with a bad police.

98
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,535
If we pick the torn note,
the killer will get us.

99
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,455
We'll get caught
with the nastiest crook.

100
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,695
2 men, twins.
How will they come up again?

101
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,735
That's the game.
Mumbai 2.0!

102
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,095
I'll give you 6 weeks.

103
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,855
Within 6 weeks,
I want a working prototype.

104
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,575
I'm nervous.

105
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,295
Do you remember me?

106
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,695
I'm Adi.

107
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,175
Tara.

108
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,975
Number?

109
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,775
I'm do you know I'm Tamil?

110
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,975
You called me with a kind word
at the station the other day.

111
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,215
What did you say?
Senseless...

112
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,695
Senseless Kanmani (love).
-Kanmani?!

113
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,895
I heard an 'ich'.

114
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,015
Is there an 'ich' in Kanmani?

115
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,535
You'll say anything
when you're tensed.

116
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,015
Are you Ananya's friend?
-College mate.

117
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,415
We're working together now.

118
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,295
She is pretty and happy.

119
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,655
It'll be fun for some time.
They'll always be laughing.

120
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,815
Wedding and honeymoon.
-Kissing and hugging.

121
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,735
Love.
-Lust.

122
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,575
Lust has to be there.

123
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,335
Must see them later?
-What will happen?

124
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,335
Small arguments.

125
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,615
He'll joke about his
wife to his friends.

126
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,655
When they get back,
the wife would hit him.

127
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,535
A child in between.
-The child will wail.

128
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,375
And keep vomiting.
-Pooh all over.

129
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,095
They will look frantically
for a school to enrol the child.

130
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,895
Torture the poor child
who is not interested in studies.

131
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,935
After the child is bigger?
-Get her married...

132
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,815
...make her
face the same torture...

133
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,575
Make sure she goes
through it. Right?

134
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,335
100%.

135
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,935
You are so right.
Are you married?

136
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,215
I swear I won't get married.
-Wedding is for fools.

137
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,095
Right.
-Only girlfriends?

138
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,335
Around 15 of them.
-Very good.

139
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,775
You?
-I want to go to Paris.

140
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,855
Why?
-Further my studies.

141
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,055
You?
-I want to become rich.

142
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,895
Like Steve Jobs
or Mark Zuckerberg.

143
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,575
Late night party,
coming home at 3 am...

144
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,855
...I told you I don't like it.
-Sorry, uncle.

145
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,855
Ananya's wedding,
she got caught.

146
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,215
I want to go
to the Electricity Board.

147
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,015
My electricity bill
is not right the past 2 months.

148
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,535
If you pay them,
they'll correct it.

149
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,215
I don't believe in bribe.
I'll go and see them.

150
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,655
I'm not saying this
for you to praise me.

151
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,175
Bombay Jayashree
is performing this evening.

152
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,375
You're taking Bhavani.
-Me?!

153
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,095
You're going to take her.

154
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,895
Not too much sugar, right?
-I added the right amount.

155
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,215
- How can one man be at 2 places...

156
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,175
...at the same time?
You take her.

157
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,175
Ravindra Natya Mandir.

158
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,775
I have work in the office.
-Work finishes at 6.

159
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,775
Why are you following me?
-To keep an eye on you.

160
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,615
I've lived in Bombay for
23 years. I'll go on my own.

161
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,935
This is not Bombay
anymore, it's Mumbai.

162
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,175
That is why I'm following you.
-I said, don't follow me.

163
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,375
Okay, I won't.

164
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,895
When did they change
the name to Mumbai?

165
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,415
How are you?

166
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,655
Looks like you're a star.
-Yes.

167
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,935
Get out!
-Me?

168
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,055
You were snoring
during the performance.

169
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,255
I'm sleepy, aunty.
I work day and night.

170
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,015
Why are you so sleepy?
Get out!

171
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,255
Hello, Bhavani,
isn't this too much?

172
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,735
Are you going to leave or not?
Get down from the bus! Get out!

173
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,175
Go now!
-I'm not Uncle Ganapathy.

174
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,895
Don't yell.
-Go now!

175
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,015
Are you going to go or not?
-Okay!

176
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,655
No sense of appreciation!

177
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,335
How was the performance?

178
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,295
You're great,
Uncle Ganapathy.

179
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,855
You're like God.
Hats off!

180
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,895
Bhavani, do you want anything?
-I need to cook, it's late.

181
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,615
We cooked and ate.

182
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,175
Roasted potato, you made it.

183
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,935
When?
-It was nice and spicy.

184
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,215
You need to wash
the pot properly, it's burnt.

185
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,095
Alzheimer, early stage.
-Vasu told me before I came here.

186
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,775
She knows something is wrong.

187
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,615
That is why she gets
angry all of a sudden.

188
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,735
How do you look after her?

189
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,095
When she wakes up in the morning,
she calls me Ganapathy...

190
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,175
...and all will be fine.

191
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,415
What are you looking?
-No way, I can't be like you.

192
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,695
Let it soak,
I'll wash in the morning.

193
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,815
Yes, I've opened an account.

194
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,855
Which branch?
-Lokhandwala branch.

195
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,495
Your friend, Srikanth,
was there.

196
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,415
I want to save my money.

197
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,615
Tell me if you need more.
-No!

198
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,215
You don't need to send anymore.
-/ told you to meet K esa van.

199
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,735
Remember?
-Yes.

200
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,455
What happened?
-I'll meet him this week.

201
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,055
Do you know how to go?
-Vashi, right?

202
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,695
Right, the 3rd stop.
-3rd stop.

203
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,295
You gave me
all the instructions.

204
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,175
If you call and say
you're lost, I'll yell.

205
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,375
Yes, continue.

206
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,055
3rd stop in Vashi.
You won't get coffee there.

207
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,295
You only get tea.
-Right.

208
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,255
My battery is weak,
I can't hear you.

209
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,255
Hello!

210
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,935
Brother!

211
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,655
The number you're trying to
reach is currently not available.

212
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,935
It's me,
your 16th girlfriend.

213
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,815
I thought you were No. 10.

214
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,455
Can I talk?
Or is it wrong to call?

215
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,175
No, you can talk.

216
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,895
I felt like listening
to someone talk in Tamil.

217
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,535
Is that all you know?

218
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,015
No, I know Thevaram
and Thiruvasagam too.

219
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,615
Why are you talking that way?
Someone beside you?

220
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,095
Yes, ghosts and spirits.

221
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,055
Tamil ghosts?
-No, fat Hindi ghost.

222
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,335
Then you can speak.

223
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,975
Can we meet?

224
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,175
Isn't it wrong to make friends
with a Tamil guy so fast?

225
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,615
It is, but shall we make
a small mistake by having...

226
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,295
...coffee together at 3.45?
Besides, tomorrow is a Saturday.

227
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,375
Yes or yes?
-No.

228
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,295
Bye.
-Don't put the phone down.

229
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,975
I've put it down.
Bye to all the ghosts.

230
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,095
Guess who you are going
to work with?

231
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,815
Salman Khan?
-Architect Balakrishna Doshi.

232
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,975
Boss wants to see you,
come on.

233
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,295
Hi!
-Hi.

234
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,415
Where are you?
-Me? In my office.

235
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,495
Thank God I didn't wait
for you to have coffee.

236
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,175
What would have happened?
-I would have got angry.

237
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,455
<i>Would have felt
like killing someone.</i>

238
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,735
I'll talk to m ysell'.

239
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,815
I'll think whether to call you
or not.

240
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,015
Are you waiting there?

241
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,175
<i>Sorry.
-I had 2 cups of coffee...</i>

242
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,695
...and one lime juice.

243
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,415
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Can you wait?

244
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,415
Promise?
-Promise!

245
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,975
Lift!

246
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,975
It's opening, I'm in the lift.
I pressed zero.

247
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,615
The lift is going down fast.
Still going.

248
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,895
I'll take an auto and come
there in 5 minutes...

249
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,815
Hello!
-Are you here?

250
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,575
Shall I wait for you there?
-Is this your idea of joke?

251
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,295
This isn't a joke,
coffee time.

252
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,255
Shall I push the bike
and walk with you?

253
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,095
What did you tell
in your office?

254
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,535
That I'm going to have millet
in a coffeehouse...

255
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,535
...with a Tamil guy.
-Tara!

256
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,815
Come on.
-Who is that hero?

257
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,935
He is looking at us.
-The man you saw at the station.

258
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,095
The bad guy?

259
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,295
You tried to stop
the train because of him?

260
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,975
Just a drama, I thought
he'll turn and look at me.

261
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,215
He didn't, you looked at me.
-He's coming.

262
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,215
What's the story?
-A friend.

263
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,455
Then all of a sudden
he wanted to marry me.

264
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,495
I said no.
He kept on following me.

265
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,375
Did you agree?
-No.

266
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,935
Then I found out
why he was following me.

267
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,055
Why?

268
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,655
He asked my friend,
Rathna, about me.

269
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,415
He asked about my parents,
our worth in Coimbatore...

270
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,855
...everything.

271
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,775
He didn't want to marry me.
He wanted my money.

272
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,855
What did you say?
-I agreed to marry him.

273
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,975
You agreed?
-I told him I'll leave my mother.

274
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,495
She won't give me a paise
and he must support me.

275
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,895
He got scared. I threatened
to jump in front of the train.

276
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,775
That's when you came.

277
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,935
With an insane heart...

278
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,775
Young and naughty...

279
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,695
With a beautiful tune...

280
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,575
Okay on my girl's lap...

281
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,295
With an insane heart...

282
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,935
Young and naughty...

283
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,815
With a beautiful tune...

284
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,855
Okay on my girl's lap...

285
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,895
Yesterday is gone...

286
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,775
Tomorrow is a pain...

287
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,655
Just like my Laila...

288
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,455
We're the king
and queen today...

289
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,295
With an insane heart...

290
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,935
Young and naughty...

291
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,815
With a beautiful tune...

292
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,895
Okay on my girl's lap...

293
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,695
Don't pinch with your eyes...

294
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,375
Don't go without disturbing...

295
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,815
Don't jump when I touch...

296
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,615
Don't go
even if I leave you...

297
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,175
Marriage, wife and in-laws...

298
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,135
Girl and boy...

299
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,095
Love...

300
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,575
With an insane heart...

301
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,535
Young and naughty...

302
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,415
With a beautiful tune...

303
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,615
Okay on my girl's lap...

304
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,935
Can we meet tomorrow?
-Yes!

305
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,935
Where?
-Ahmedabad.

306
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,375
Office work, express train.
-Then when?

307
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,015
Aunty Bhavani, how did you
and Uncle Ganapathy get married?

308
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,655
How did Uncle Ganapathy
and you get married?

309
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,935
He is cutting...
-Ladies finger.

310
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,335
Ask him.
-How did you win her?

311
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,855
Don't be shy, Ganapathy.

312
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,135
I'm from Kumbakonam.

313
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,455
There is no Tamil
or Cauvery in Bombay.

314
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,215
Bhavani had a performance
in Shanmuganantha Sabha.

315
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,135
Were you 20 then?
-19.SubTiTle By PMS Creation

316
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,495
She used to sing very well.
-How did I look? Tell them.

317
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,775
A big star. I used
to attend all her performances.

318
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,735
I had a friend called Sounderajan.
He came along with me.

319
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,255
A well known doctor but knew
nothing about classical music.

320
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,095
He came to woo Bhavani.

321
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,015
Did you close your eyes and
listen to my songs, Ganapathy?

322
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,255
Sounder told a letter to Bhavani.
-A love letter.

323
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,215
But he was too shy,
he told me to give it to her.

324
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,215
I gave it to her.

325
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,815
But the fool
forgot to sign the letter.

326
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,975
What would I think?
-That Uncle Ganapathy...

327
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,535
...gave you the love letter.
-Yes, he was dark and handsome.

328
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,175
One day, she held my hand,
took all the letters and...

329
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,015
...stood in front of her father.
We got married in 3 months.

330
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,455
We don't normally get
a second chance.

331
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,455
You must catch it when it comes.
-Smile, buddy.

332
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,655
What are you doing here?

333
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,895
Where is this train going?
Ahmedabad, right?

334
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,495
What for?
-Sightseeing.

335
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,055
Do you do this often?
-You mean go sightseeing?

336
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,415
Going after girls.
-Since birth.

337
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,375
Really? How many?
-I don't keep count.

338
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,095
You're lying.

339
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,255
I know you wouldn't even
have touched a girl before.

340
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,895
You may be right.
-How did you get the ticket?

341
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,255
I didn't buy a ticket,
didn't have the time.

342
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,415
What if you're caught?
-If I'm caught...

343
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,655
...I'm caught.

344
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,975
Okay, come in.
-Don't go, stand here.

345
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,295
They are waiting.
-What for?

346
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,455
They'll come and look for me.
-Let them look.

347
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,535
Okay, let them look.

348
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,695
What was the grandpa saying?

349
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,575
He is Balakrishna Doshi.

350
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,175
My guru.
-What did he say?

351
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,495
He told me not to trust
those who design video games.

352
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,135
My father comes here every day.
-Will he come now?

353
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,095
Does he like to fight?
Don't get me into trouble.

354
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,655
He won't come. He left.
-How?

355
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,446
He decided to leave,
so he left.

356
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:29,926
Mother?
-She is in Coimbatore.

357
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:38,766
What happened?

358
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,646
They were always fighting,
sometimes they used force.

359
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,446
Court case.

360
00:36:56,511 --> 00:37:01,046
They called a 7 year old
and asked her...

361
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:04,326
...if she wanted to live
with mommy or daddy.

362
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:15,046
I didn't want both of them.

363
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:22,206
I decided then
not to get married.

364
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:47,166
We're late
for the train, right?

365
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:54,646
Run!

366
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:06,526
What shall we do now?
-How can you ask me?

367
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:23,646
The bus is only at 8 am.
There is a hotel nearby.

368
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:27,646
Both of us?
-Yes.

369
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:32,046
In one room?
-There is only one room left.

370
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:40,366
Will you behave
if we stay in one room?

371
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:45,446
I swear I won't behave,
I'll sleep in the balcony.

372
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:52,046
Will I behave
with you by my side?

373
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:55,726
Can you?

374
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:59,886
Can
-Why even bother?

375
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:02,926
A bad climax for a good movie.

376
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:07,726
Where is the hotel?
-Nearby.

377
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:16,566
Adithya Varadarajan?
-You don't even know my name.

378
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:04,086
What is that?
-Loopy.

379
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:09,646
Come here!

380
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,606
Come!

381
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:13,446
Say something.

382
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:15,846
Say what you're thinking.
Sing a song.

383
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:18,046
Song?

384
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:22,006
Sing.

385
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:26,286
Sing!

386
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,206
Shall / fly...

387
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:33,246
Shall / fly...

388
00:40:56,031 --> 00:40:58,606
Shall / fly...

389
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:02,286
Shall / fly...

390
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:14,206
A new place and time...

391
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:17,166
I started to stammer...

392
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:22,406
A new place and time...

393
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,246
I started to stammer...

394
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:25,766
It was pleasant...

395
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:28,166
A new place and time...

396
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,846
I started to stammer...

397
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,406
It was pleasant...

398
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:33,726
A new place and time...

399
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:35,406
I started to stammer...

400
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:37,086
It was pleasant...

401
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:39,486
A new place and time...

402
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:41,126
I started to stammer...

403
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,926
It was pleasant...

404
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:50,606
Don't think, go...

405
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:53,806
Don't beg, go...

406
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,246
Shall / fly...

407
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:18,366
Shall / fly...

408
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:23,926
You...

409
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:26,686
Don't leave me,
don't touch me...

410
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:07,766
Don't think, go...

411
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:10,846
Don't beg, go...

412
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:17,926
<i>Let's get wet without rain...</i>

413
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:23,406
<i>Let's get together
without our body...</i>

414
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:29,486
<i>Let's float like clouds...</i>

415
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:35,166
We'll vanish
as the wind blows...

416
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:40,326
<i>Let's fly...</i>

417
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:46,206
<i>Let's fly...</i>

418
00:43:46,551 --> 00:43:52,206
<i>Let's fly...</i>

419
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:57,486
<i>Let's fly...</i>

420
00:43:57,911 --> 00:44:03,526
<i>Let's fly...</i>

421
00:44:03,671 --> 00:44:08,646
<i>Let's fly...</i>

422
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:28,566
2 minutes.

423
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:41,886
Tell me it was the best
holiday you ever had.

424
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:44,846
This was my best holiday.
Did I say that properly?

425
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:49,966
You lied. Be truthful.
-Shall I be frank?

426
00:44:50,111 --> 00:44:53,566
No, don't say anything.

427
00:44:53,831 --> 00:44:57,486
Okay, Kanmani.
-Am I your Kanmani?

428
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:00,486
Yes, Kanmani.

429
00:45:02,391 --> 00:45:05,246
Can I go now?
I have to go.

430
00:45:05,391 --> 00:45:09,366
Say, "Okay, Kanmani."
-No, Kanmani!

431
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,046
Aunty!

432
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:35,646
Temple offering.

433
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:38,086
Hello, uncle.
-There are podi and pickles here.

434
00:45:38,231 --> 00:45:40,206
Your aunty brought them.

435
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:46,806
Hi, mom.
-Let's go in and talk.

436
00:45:54,831 --> 00:45:58,966
Where did you go?
-Ahmedabad, some research work.

437
00:45:59,111 --> 00:46:01,766
Would you like to eat
in the canteen? Aloo poha.

438
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:07,846
Your friends came back yesterday.
-Are you here to spy on me?

439
00:46:07,991 --> 00:46:11,966
Why? Is it wrong
to worry about my only girl?

440
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:16,166
You're not worried. You only
want to know where I went.

441
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:20,646
Okay, tell me, where did you go?
I was worried about you.

442
00:46:20,951 --> 00:46:23,006
I even called
the commissioner.

443
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:29,526
I'm asking you, you're not
answering. Where did you go?

444
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:33,526
With whom did you go?
-Do you tell me each time you go?

445
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:36,206
Do I ask you with whom you go?

446
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:39,326
I'll slap you, I don't care
if we're at the hostel.

447
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:41,726
Tell me, where did you go?

448
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:48,886
Where did you go?
-To see father.

449
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:54,766
I went to see
his last place. Enough?

450
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,406
Don't behave like your father.

451
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,366
We have a big factory
and business back home.

452
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,166
Drop what you're doing here,
come and run the business.

453
00:47:01,311 --> 00:47:04,286
Let's go.
-I'm going to Paris.

454
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:07,726
On a scholarship.
I don't think I'll be back.

455
00:47:07,871 --> 00:47:10,646
I'm telling you,
why are you being adamant?

456
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:13,806
I told you I'm not interested
in that company.

457
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:15,726
How many times
must I tell you?

458
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:17,926
I shouldn't have let
you come this far.

459
00:47:18,071 --> 00:47:20,126
I should have kept you
in Coimbatore.

460
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:23,006
Just leave me for some time.

461
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:32,006
So?
-What?

462
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:36,366
What happened in Ahmedabad?
-Nothing.

463
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:38,326
Nothing happened.

464
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:41,406
As far as I know,
you didn't take the train back.

465
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:43,486
You didn't come back.
-Right?

466
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:47,806
You didn't come.
-You spent the night there.

467
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:52,126
So what?
-Tell us who it is.

468
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,126
Who?
-I can't wait, tell me.

469
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:59,286
Girl.
-This is too much, tell us.

470
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,606
What are you doing here?
-Tell them you're not well...

471
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,766
...and come out.

472
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:15,886
Tell them you have a migraine.
You're dizzy...

473
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:20,206
...and you'll be back tomorrow.
-Are you crazy?

474
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:29,406
Come on!

475
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:47,686
I didn't sleep last night.
-Me too.

476
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,246
Really?
-My body is still shaking.

477
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:11,326
Adi, tell me you've had enough.
-Enough.

478
00:49:11,471 --> 00:49:15,486
Then stop, don't come near.
-I'm trying, but I can't.

479
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:18,286
Don't!

480
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:20,726
Okay-

481
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:29,366
Love? Won't you say it?
-Shall I?

482
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:33,086
I want ice cream.

483
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:48,806
Shall I tell my mother
to come tomorrow?

484
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:50,726
What for?

485
00:49:50,871 --> 00:49:55,126
To meet you.
-Me? Why?

486
00:49:56,871 --> 00:50:01,766
Shouldn't they meet and talk?
We'll get engaged.

487
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:08,366
Engaged?

488
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:23,926
Look at your face,
you're scared.

489
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:32,126
I got scared.

490
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:35,846
So no engagement and wedding.
Right?

491
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:41,406
You said marriage is for fools.
-So the trip to Ahmedabad?

492
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:43,446
The kiss today?

493
00:50:43,591 --> 00:50:45,486
Were you joking?
"No!

494
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,806
What?
-No means no.

495
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:04,686
We have to get away
from here now.

496
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,086
If I get caught, I'll lose my job.
-Why?

497
00:51:09,071 --> 00:51:10,966
Come!

498
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:14,246
Phone!

499
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:19,006
Where are you taking me?

500
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,886
To your hostel.
-Why?

501
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:26,286
To send you back safely
to your room.

502
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:28,726
Why all of a sudden?

503
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:31,766
I want to send you back
before I change my mind.

504
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:37,966
What if you change your mind?
-I'll hug you.

505
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:42,126
If you hug me?
-I won't let you go.

506
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:44,486
Then?

507
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:49,886
I'll give you a kiss!
-Then?

508
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:54,246
I'll become Dushasana.
-Will you remove my clothes?

509
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:57,046
Yes!

510
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:01,526
Then?

511
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:12,486
You can go anywhere you want.
You can go to London or Paris.

512
00:52:12,631 --> 00:52:15,486
But until then,
I'll beg you to stay with me.

513
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:20,606
If you beg?

514
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:24,286
You'll melt
and look at me lovingly.

515
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:29,206
And?
-You'll pull me inside.

516
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:34,126
And?
-You'll lock the door.

517
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:37,926
And?
-I don't know what to say.

518
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:41,606
You have to tell me.
-I'll eat you.

519
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:46,606
My little secret...

520
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:52,286
My little secret...

521
00:52:52,591 --> 00:52:57,926
My small wonder...

522
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,206
Give me your tiny finger...

523
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:06,166
Give me a little space...

524
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:10,686
I don't know how to lie
for small desires...

525
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:23,366
Do you like me?
-A lot.

526
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:27,566
But this hostel is lousy.

527
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:32,846
Do you like me
or what we did?

528
00:53:32,991 --> 00:53:37,086
I like what we did.
Then I like you a little.

529
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:39,366
A wee bit.

530
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:41,886
For Rs1.50.

531
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:47,286
Rs1.50 is enough.

532
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:50,086
It's trouble
if it is too much.

533
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,566
Listen to me.

534
00:53:56,711 --> 00:53:59,646
Love and lust,
are they okay?

535
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:03,046
It's a sin, do you know that?

536
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:08,886
But you have to do the sin
repeatedly, then it'll go away.

537
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,606
I don't understand.
What did you say?

538
00:54:19,751 --> 00:54:21,766
Tara wants to stay here
as a paying guest too.

539
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:25,246
'Taravu' is swan in Malayalam.

540
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:29,286
Where?
-Here, in my room.

541
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:32,086
In your room?
-Yes.

542
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:34,806
Is this Tara?
-Yes, Bhavani.

543
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:41,606
You?
-I'll stay in the room too.

544
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:44,486
Both of you?
-Both of you?

545
00:54:44,631 --> 00:54:47,646
Together?
-Yes.

546
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:51,686
Are you married?
-No!

547
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:56,886
I don't believe in marriage.
-The groom has Sevvai dhosam?

548
00:54:57,831 --> 00:55:02,286
If I marry him, I have to follow
him whenever he gets a transfer.

549
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:06,726
Why should we follow them, aunty?
-What is she saying?

550
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:12,086
I'll go abroad soon. Paris.
Adi will become rich.

551
00:55:12,231 --> 00:55:15,846
He'll go to UK or US.
-Until then?

552
00:55:15,991 --> 00:55:19,046
We want to live together.

553
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:28,166
Is it wrong, aunty?
-Definitely.

554
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:34,046
Ganapathy is old fashioned.
Old school.

555
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:36,446
When he's driving,
even when he gives signal...

556
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:39,526
...he'll bring down the mirror
and give hand signal.

557
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:44,926
Does your brother know?
-He'll kill me.

558
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:47,606
This won't work.

559
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:50,246
Uncle...
-It won't work.

560
00:55:50,391 --> 00:55:51,846
Uncle Ganapathy.
-No!

561
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:53,446
Come out for a minute.
-The answer is no.

562
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:56,526
Just minute.
-It won't work in this house.

563
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,086
Come out for a minute.

564
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,766
Can you sing?

565
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:16,446
Must we meet secretly?

566
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:18,486
Or can we do it openly...

567
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:20,526
...with your blessing
and permission?

568
00:56:21,231 --> 00:56:23,046
Do you need my blessing?

569
00:56:23,191 --> 00:56:25,006
Who's going to
answer your brother?

570
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:27,126
Aunty Bhavani isn't well.

571
00:56:27,271 --> 00:56:29,126
You're looking
after her on your own.

572
00:56:29,271 --> 00:56:31,406
If we're with you, we'll help you.
-No.

573
00:56:31,551 --> 00:56:34,406
Please think.
-I've decided. Bhavani too.

574
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:35,966
You're just
as stubborn as my brother.

575
00:56:36,111 --> 00:56:38,326
Bhavani will not accept it.
-I <i>asked</i> for flowers...

576
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:41,206
You gave me a garden...

577
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:43,846
I asked for water...

578
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:46,686
You gave me honey...

579
00:56:46,831 --> 00:56:49,486
I asked for flowers...

580
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:52,246
You gave me a garden...

581
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:54,526
I asked for water...

582
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:57,606
You gave me honey...

583
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:03,326
What should I ask...

584
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:11,366
What should I ask...

585
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,846
So that you'll give
yourself up...

586
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:16,886
What should I ask...

587
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:19,486
So that you'll give
yourself up...

588
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:22,286
I asked for flowers...

589
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:25,006
You gave me a garden...

590
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,606
I asked for water...

591
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:30,446
You gave me honey...

592
00:57:30,591 --> 00:57:33,046
I asked for flowers...

593
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:35,846
I asked for flowers...

594
00:57:35,991 --> 00:57:38,606
I asked for flowers...

595
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:41,246
I asked for flowers...

596
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:44,166
What should I ask...

597
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:47,326
So that you'll give
yourself up...

598
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:11,526
I asked for flowers...

599
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:14,366
You gave me a garden...

600
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:17,006
I asked for water...

601
00:58:17,151 --> 00:58:20,166
You gave me honey...

602
00:59:05,471 --> 00:59:08,046
Hi, aunty!
How are you?

603
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:16,206
Hi, uncle.
-Careful.

604
00:59:38,671 --> 00:59:40,126
My sister-in-law.
-Who?

605
00:59:40,271 --> 00:59:43,246
My sister-in-law.
Who else would call me?

606
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:48,326
Hello! I'm fine.

607
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:50,966
What I'm doing?
-Tell the truth.

608
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:55,046
I'm working.
How is brother?

609
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,446
Jaya girl?
-Who is that?

610
00:59:57,591 --> 01:00:01,126
What? Hello!

611
01:00:04,631 --> 01:00:08,246
Yes, I can hear you.
Taxi driver?

612
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:12,166
Which address?
You are here?

613
01:00:12,311 --> 01:00:16,366
In Mumbai? What for?

614
01:00:16,631 --> 01:00:19,646
They are in Mumbai!

615
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:21,486
Hello, driver!

616
01:00:32,311 --> 01:00:36,126
Yes? Please come.
Been ages since I saw you.

617
01:00:36,271 --> 01:00:38,206
Okay-

618
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:43,486
We're caught! We're dead!

619
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,246
They are coming here.

620
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:50,806
Now?
-My brother has a conference.

621
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:54,166
Why did you give the right
address to the taxi driver?

622
01:00:54,311 --> 01:00:56,526
You're a fool.

623
01:00:57,671 --> 01:01:02,006
Get up.
Where will you go now?

624
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:05,926
Why should I go?
-Are you joking?

625
01:01:06,071 --> 01:01:09,366
My brother will get mad.
He's a control freak.

626
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:11,486
Shall I hide under the bed?

627
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:14,606
It won't work.
My sister-in-law will sniff you.

628
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:16,766
Go!
"No!

629
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:18,366
Get
"No!

630
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:20,606
What do you mean?
-I will not go from here.

631
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:23,446
When they come,
I'll say hello to them.

632
01:01:23,591 --> 01:01:25,206
I'll say I'm Tara and
that I'm living in sin with Adi.

633
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:27,886
Then I'll go back to bed.

634
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:33,126
It's my sister-in-law.

635
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:39,006
Hello? You're here?
So fast? First floor.

636
01:01:39,151 --> 01:01:42,006
Say it's the second floor.
We'll get another 5 minutes.

637
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:49,286
Love, please get up.

638
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:52,926
My love! Get up!

639
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:56,286
Don't be stubborn,
don't make a man beg.

640
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,286
They are only visiting.

641
01:01:58,431 --> 01:02:01,126
If we play it right,
we can avoid problems.

642
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:05,846
Parsley, get up!
-What?

643
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:08,486
Okay, gongura. Get up.

644
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,966
Your brother is here.

645
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:27,246
Hi, Adi!
-Hi, brother.

646
01:02:27,951 --> 01:02:29,806
How are you?
-First class!

647
01:02:29,951 --> 01:02:31,686
Hi, Jaya!

648
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:35,766
Bill Gates, are you behaving?
-Yes.

649
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:41,926
No! Adi, we just had.
-Have another cup.

650
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:43,726
Coffee please.

651
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,366
Aunty Bhavani,
look who is here.

652
01:02:47,511 --> 01:02:49,246
Hello, Mrs. Bhavani.
How are you?

653
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,166
Do you remember me?

654
01:02:51,311 --> 01:02:53,886
Isn't Mr. Ganapathy home?
I'll tell you where he has gone.

655
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:56,046
Walking,
4 rounds around the park.

656
01:02:56,191 --> 01:02:58,246
He'll buy papers back.
Right?

657
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:00,646
Mysore pak.
It seems Mr. Ganapathy loves it.

658
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:03,286
Who are they, Adi?
-Sister Saroja.

659
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:06,806
I'm Vasu, I worked
with Mr. Ganapathy in IOB.

660
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:11,206
Where are you staying?
-Me? Over here.

661
01:03:11,951 --> 01:03:15,086
You met Saroja during the wedding.
You're just seeing Jaya.

662
01:03:15,231 --> 01:03:19,166
Here?
-Have coffee first.

663
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:24,086
It's a bachelor's room,
it'll be dirty.

664
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:26,566
I know.

665
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:30,326
I have a confession.
There are many changes in life.

666
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:33,406
We'll talk later.
-I wanted to tell you.

667
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:36,606
Wait!

668
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:41,446
Your brother's room is so neat.
He's not dirty like you.

669
01:03:41,591 --> 01:03:44,446
What is this?

670
01:03:50,951 --> 01:03:52,966
Didn't you hide
any cigarette packs?

671
01:03:53,111 --> 01:03:57,126
Not bad, Adi, you changed.
-it's your training.

672
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:11,646
You're late, Ganapathy.
-Another half a round.

673
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:15,886
Conference?
-Business plan review.

674
01:04:16,031 --> 01:04:19,006
My branch sent me.
I'm going back tomorrow.

675
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:22,566
Welcome! Stay here,
don't go anywhere.

676
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:24,726
I told you so.
Here, Bhavani.

677
01:04:29,351 --> 01:04:31,206
Maria, where are you going?
-I'll put these clothes...

678
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:35,766
...and come back.
-Fast.

679
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:41,526
Gamer, I'm waiting...

680
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:46,486
Gamer, I'm waiting...

681
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,286
Gamer...

682
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:06,366
Run!

683
01:05:17,031 --> 01:05:19,926
Have you been doing this
ever since you got here?

684
01:05:20,071 --> 01:05:21,846
He has been doing since birth.

685
01:05:21,991 --> 01:05:24,926
Where are the bag guys?
Look behind!

686
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:07,766
I'm caught!

687
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:17,006
Vasu, this is Tara.
-Uncle Ganapathy's niece.

688
01:06:17,151 --> 01:06:19,686
My niece?
-Yes.

689
01:06:19,831 --> 01:06:24,006
Ganapathy has no niece.

690
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,086
Yes.

691
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:30,926
I'm Vasu, Mr. Ganapathy's
junior in the bank.

692
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,806
Adi's brother.
-Hi!

693
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:35,926
I saw her.

694
01:06:36,151 --> 01:06:38,406
Did I disturb
your family reunion?

695
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:41,046
Aunty, your CD.

696
01:06:41,191 --> 01:06:45,646
Adi, she's going into your room?
-My drawings are in there.

697
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:48,286
How did her drawing
get in there?

698
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:51,406
Mr. Ganapathy removed it.
It's under the bed!

699
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:53,486
Sit, uncle.
-Uncle, you have a life.

700
01:06:53,631 --> 01:06:56,166
Let's play-

701
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:07,126
I think I left
my drawings at work.

702
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:09,646
Aunty, house key.
-Why?

703
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:12,046
Tara, where are you staying?
-Me?

704
01:07:12,191 --> 01:07:14,406
Over here.
-Here.

705
01:07:14,551 --> 01:07:17,366
Here?
-Here, where else?

706
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:19,486
I said I saw them.

707
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:23,286
She caught uncle...
-I'm late for work.

708
01:07:23,431 --> 01:07:25,806
Get her an auto.
-I'll get one for her.

709
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:29,766
It's okay, I'll go.
I'm coming.

710
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:35,446
Mr. Ganapathy, you didn't
tell me you had a niece.

711
01:07:35,631 --> 01:07:40,206
Ganapathy has no niece, Vasu.
I'm telling you, you don't get it?

712
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:43,126
Are you slow?

713
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:45,926
He is not fast enough.
-He's like that.

714
01:07:46,071 --> 01:07:48,406
Thank you, sir.
-Slow in the bank too.

715
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:52,366
I'm first!

716
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:55,406
Daddy!
-Careful!

717
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:57,526
Bye, you don't have to come down.
-Why? I'll come with you.

718
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:02,806
Tara, come with me for a minute.
Close the door behind you.

719
01:08:11,911 --> 01:08:13,326
Wait!

720
01:08:13,471 --> 01:08:14,846
Adi!
-I'm Vasu.

721
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:17,087
What I wanted to say?
-You wanted to wish them...

722
01:08:17,232 --> 01:08:19,367
...a safe journey.
-Bye!

723
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:24,127
Teach her singing or violin.
-Sure.

724
01:08:25,192 --> 01:08:27,207
Okay!

725
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:30,567
There are many more
things in the bathroom.

726
01:08:31,032 --> 01:08:33,127
What's happening here?

727
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:37,327
Looks like
you're blackmailing me.

728
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,607
If Vasu finds out, all hell
will break loose. He's...

729
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:45,207
A control freak?
-So?

730
01:08:45,352 --> 01:08:47,447
You could have asked Adi.

731
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:50,727
I know you won't mind,
so I'm asking.

732
01:08:50,872 --> 01:08:55,767
Can we get Tara married to Adi?
Will you consider it?

733
01:08:57,032 --> 01:09:01,967
This is not right. It's good
if Adi and you get married.

734
01:09:02,112 --> 01:09:07,367
I'll conduct the wedding.
Or, you can leave.

735
01:09:10,552 --> 01:09:12,247
Don't get me wrong...

736
01:09:12,392 --> 01:09:16,127
...will everything be okay
if there's a marriage certificate?

737
01:09:19,632 --> 01:09:22,367
Saroja, we're late. We need
extra 30 minutes for traffic.

738
01:09:22,512 --> 01:09:26,687
Let's go! Dad said this.
-Tell him I'm coming. Run!

739
01:09:27,232 --> 01:09:32,247
Live in relationship
is an embarrassment.

740
01:09:32,592 --> 01:09:35,527
It is not right at all.

741
01:09:36,392 --> 01:09:39,927
Careful! Don't knock anywhere.

742
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:46,367
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, madam.

743
01:09:46,512 --> 01:09:49,767
Think and let me know.
Talk to Tara's parent's too.

744
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:54,007
Ask Tara too. Just e-mail me.
Bye, madam.

745
01:10:02,272 --> 01:10:04,887
Your sister-in-law
knows everything.

746
01:10:05,152 --> 01:10:07,807
No.
-I'm not lying.

747
01:10:07,952 --> 01:10:12,567
Really? How did she know?
-She is too inquisitive.

748
01:10:14,272 --> 01:10:17,087
I don't think she knows.

749
01:10:19,072 --> 01:10:22,447
She said your brother
will wreak havoc if he finds out.

750
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:28,247
You're lying.
You terrorising me.

751
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:31,567
She told me to marry you
or don't even look at you.

752
01:10:31,712 --> 01:10:35,527
She then kissed my cheek
and left a bomb in my hand.

753
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:38,047
What did you say?
-That I'm going to Paris...

754
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:41,847
...and you're going to US.
We're not ready for commitment.

755
01:10:42,712 --> 01:10:48,167
You told her everything?
Freedom!

756
01:10:55,072 --> 01:10:57,447
Where are we going?
-You said you'll even follow...

757
01:10:57,592 --> 01:11:02,127
...me to hell.
-Are we going to hell?

758
01:11:02,352 --> 01:11:06,887
Come quietly.
-Okay, I won't open my mouth.

759
01:11:10,472 --> 01:11:13,887
Is this a gynaecologist clinic?

760
01:11:14,352 --> 01:11:16,527
Hi, Sujatha?
-Just a minute, ma'am.

761
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:19,327
Let me check.
-Okay.

762
01:11:19,472 --> 01:11:22,087
What are we doing here?

763
01:11:24,312 --> 01:11:26,127
Tests?

764
01:11:26,272 --> 01:11:28,127
For Aunty Bhavani?
-Quiet!

765
01:11:31,072 --> 01:11:34,367
Why is everyone here fat?

766
01:11:35,232 --> 01:11:37,927
Columbus does
not understand yet?

767
01:11:38,072 --> 01:11:42,327
Excuse me, ma'am. Please wait.
-Okay.

768
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:47,607
So many people are pregnant?
-Yes, loverboy.

769
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:51,167
Our people have
nothing better to do.

770
01:12:04,232 --> 01:12:06,327
So what I'm thinking is true?

771
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:09,847
How do I know
what you're thinking?

772
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:14,247
The sample we brought
is not Bhavani's, it is Tara's.

773
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:17,767
100 marks.

774
01:12:17,912 --> 01:12:21,487
You...
-We're only doing a test.

775
01:12:21,832 --> 01:12:25,927
There is a possibility?
-Maybe.

776
01:12:29,232 --> 01:12:33,087
Don't look as if
it's the end of the world.

777
01:12:34,152 --> 01:12:36,727
What is the test is a 'yes'?
-What?

778
01:12:36,872 --> 01:12:41,807
If it is positive?
-How would I know if you ask me?

779
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:48,327
The world is getting dark.

780
01:12:49,152 --> 01:12:52,527
You were counting the days.

781
01:12:59,672 --> 01:13:02,407
Tamil?
-Yes.

782
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:05,687
First time?
-Yes.

783
01:13:05,832 --> 01:13:09,687
Don't escape after this visit.
Bring her here every month.

784
01:13:09,832 --> 01:13:13,287
Don't give excuses
like my husband.

785
01:13:19,352 --> 01:13:24,327
Have you gone for a scan?
I'm waiting with a full bladder.

786
01:13:24,472 --> 01:13:26,047
I need to drink
another 3 glasses of water.

787
01:13:26,192 --> 01:13:29,327
It's torture.

788
01:13:30,752 --> 01:13:32,847
But I'll forget everything
once I see those tiny fingers...

789
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,807
...while scanning.

790
01:13:41,032 --> 01:13:45,487
Bye! What happened?
Did you see any fingers?

791
01:13:47,872 --> 01:13:50,727
Look at the results.

792
01:13:52,832 --> 01:13:55,527
Why are there
so many lines here?

793
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:59,207
It looks like a plan.

794
01:14:00,672 --> 01:14:02,567
We are doing renovation
for this clinic.

795
01:14:02,712 --> 01:14:05,367
This is the approval
from the corporation.

796
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,327
I was only joking.
Did you get scared?

797
01:14:08,472 --> 01:14:10,087
Joking? It was scary.

798
01:14:10,232 --> 01:14:12,647
It'll take 10 days
for me to recover from this.

799
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:34,527
What is this?
-Our game, boss.

800
01:14:38,032 --> 01:14:39,727
Who is this?

801
01:14:39,872 --> 01:14:41,967
Villain, boss.
-You, boss.

802
01:14:42,112 --> 01:14:45,807
Do I look like a villain?
-That's your twin, boss.

803
01:14:45,952 --> 01:14:49,127
One good boss,
one bald boss.

804
01:14:56,632 --> 01:14:59,447
Careful!

805
01:15:04,592 --> 01:15:06,367
You're messing
with the mafia head?

806
01:15:06,512 --> 01:15:08,967
I'll throw you out
from the train.

807
01:15:12,632 --> 01:15:15,687
Don't kill me.
Help me!

808
01:15:16,072 --> 01:15:19,047
Help!

809
01:15:28,472 --> 01:15:30,607
You have another 4 weeks.
4 weeks of perfection.

810
01:15:54,032 --> 01:15:57,847
Aren't you sleepy?
-No.

811
01:16:03,752 --> 01:16:06,207
You can't sleep
if you're too happy.

812
01:16:06,512 --> 01:16:12,207
The same goes when you're sad.
-Both for me.

813
01:16:15,192 --> 01:16:17,487
Looks like my admission
from Paris will arrive soon.

814
01:16:22,032 --> 01:16:25,047
You will leave him, right?

815
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:33,047
I feel like
I've lost something big.

816
01:16:33,392 --> 01:16:36,687
Does he know?

817
01:16:43,952 --> 01:16:47,887
Education and career,
are they important for you?

818
01:16:48,032 --> 01:16:50,167
Or is he important?

819
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:57,527
If you asked me 6 months ago,
I would have chosen my career.

820
01:16:59,232 --> 01:17:03,847
But now I'm greedy.
I feel like I want both.

821
01:17:22,592 --> 01:17:27,847
What happened?
Why are you packing?

822
01:17:33,992 --> 01:17:39,247
I'm packing my clothes.
-Tara, what happened?

823
01:17:40,832 --> 01:17:46,047
I'm leaving.
-Why?

824
01:18:05,032 --> 01:18:07,607
Useless girl!
-I'm going out.

825
01:18:07,752 --> 01:18:10,487
I'll be back in 2 days.

826
01:18:12,792 --> 01:18:14,607
I thought something else
and got scared.

827
01:18:14,752 --> 01:18:17,127
What do you mean?
-I thought you found out...

828
01:18:17,272 --> 01:18:21,167
...about Dimple and Sanggetha.
-Cheapskate!

829
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:26,167
Where are you going?
-Jaipur, with Mr. Doshi.

830
01:18:26,312 --> 01:18:30,607
I hate that man.
-He is 87 years old.

831
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:33,927
Why can't he take an assistant
who is 86 years old?

832
01:18:34,392 --> 01:18:37,207
Why take my Kanmani (love)?

833
01:18:37,432 --> 01:18:39,247
Soon, you'll be somewhere else,
I'll be somewhere else.

834
01:18:39,392 --> 01:18:42,207
So?
-We can't fight for our rights.

835
01:18:42,352 --> 01:18:44,527
Okay?
"Okay

836
01:18:45,072 --> 01:18:49,527
But don't leave me now.
-Hands off.

837
01:18:49,672 --> 01:18:51,847
I feel like holding an intelligent
woman and sleeping.

838
01:18:51,992 --> 01:18:54,087
So don't run away
with an 87 year old man.

839
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:56,567
Take your hands off!

840
01:18:58,712 --> 01:19:03,167
Manage with your
Dimple and Sanggetha.

841
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:06,967
Okay, bye!

842
01:19:08,032 --> 01:19:10,407
I don't like that Doshi.

843
01:19:13,672 --> 01:19:17,367
I hate the assistant
who is following him.

844
01:19:17,672 --> 01:19:21,607
I wish to say this
to the Hindi people of Mumbai.

845
01:19:41,272 --> 01:19:43,767
He)' fiery girl...

846
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:47,247
Fiery girl that hisses...

847
01:19:47,392 --> 01:19:52,927
If you go, the poem
would become meaningless...

848
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:58,287
He)' fiery girl...

849
01:19:58,432 --> 01:20:02,087
Fiery girl that hisses...

850
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:06,807
If you go, the poem
would become meaningless...

851
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:21,647
Don't leave me...

852
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:25,527
Don't leave me...

853
01:20:25,672 --> 01:20:29,247
Don't leave me...

854
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:33,327
Don't leave me...

855
01:20:33,472 --> 01:20:36,887
Don't leave me...

856
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:41,087
Don't leave me...

857
01:20:41,232 --> 01:20:46,527
Don't go...

858
01:20:50,352 --> 01:20:55,247
Don't leave me...

859
01:20:56,952 --> 01:21:02,927
Don't leave me...

860
01:21:03,752 --> 01:21:08,367
Don't leave me...

861
01:21:08,512 --> 01:21:11,567
Don't leave me...

862
01:21:11,952 --> 01:21:17,927
Don't go...

863
01:21:31,112 --> 01:21:34,847
When eyes are closed...

864
01:21:34,992 --> 01:21:38,767
When loose attire is worn...

865
01:21:38,912 --> 01:21:42,847
When you're talking to me...

866
01:21:42,992 --> 01:21:46,967
You sound like a bird...

867
01:21:49,552 --> 01:21:53,407
When eyes are closed...

868
01:21:53,552 --> 01:21:56,887
When loose attire is worn...

869
01:21:57,032 --> 01:22:01,127
When you're talking to me...

870
01:22:01,272 --> 01:22:04,207
You sound like a bird...

871
01:22:05,832 --> 01:22:09,407
When the lips are dry...

872
01:22:09,552 --> 01:22:12,687
I understand
your love for me...

873
01:22:12,832 --> 01:22:16,487
He)' fiery girl...

874
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:20,447
Fiery girl that hisses...

875
01:22:20,592 --> 01:22:25,367
If you go, the poem
would become meaningless...

876
01:22:41,072 --> 01:22:43,887
Your Kanmani is back!

877
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:53,047
Where are you?

878
01:22:53,392 --> 01:22:57,087
Not even one miss call.

879
01:23:01,392 --> 01:23:02,807
Uncle!
-Yes?

880
01:23:02,952 --> 01:23:05,847
Where is Adi?
-He went with you.

881
01:23:06,712 --> 01:23:09,087
No, he didn't come with me.

882
01:23:09,232 --> 01:23:11,687
He didn't follow you?
Where did he go these 2 days?

883
01:23:11,832 --> 01:23:15,767
He didn't come home either.
-He went back. He'll be back.

884
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:20,487
Take the plates out,
food is ready.

885
01:23:20,632 --> 01:23:22,487
I'll be back later.

886
01:23:22,632 --> 01:23:26,847
Hello, Ananya, is Adi there?

887
01:23:29,712 --> 01:23:34,727
Where is he?
I can't reach him.

888
01:23:34,872 --> 01:23:36,367
I told him not to go
anywhere for this game.

889
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,327
He didn't listen.

890
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,327
Did he get caught in
the underworld?

891
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:43,247
Quiet! Tara, wait,
I'll be back with him.

892
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:26,487
He)', what happened?

893
01:24:27,992 --> 01:24:30,767
It has been 2 days.

894
01:24:30,912 --> 01:24:33,527
Tara!
-I know.

895
01:24:33,672 --> 01:24:36,487
We should not have expectations
in a live-in relationship.

896
01:24:36,632 --> 01:24:39,007
We should not
tie each other up.

897
01:24:39,152 --> 01:24:41,527
We must give
independence, I know.

898
01:24:43,152 --> 01:24:45,087
Not that, he'll be back.

899
01:24:45,232 --> 01:24:48,527
When he does, you shouldn't
yell like a conventional wife.

900
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:52,967
Okay?

901
01:25:08,392 --> 01:25:10,007
Adi?
+11.

902
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:13,287
Where are you?
-Come out, I'll tell you.

903
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:19,367
Fast, I'm waiting.

904
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:22,767
Where are you?

905
01:25:23,392 --> 01:25:25,327
Don't wait for the lift,
it's too slow.

906
01:25:25,472 --> 01:25:29,047
Take the staircase.
-What happened?

907
01:25:36,432 --> 01:25:38,887
Where are you?

908
01:25:47,192 --> 01:25:51,327
Stop! Walk straight.

909
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,767
You'll see a glass door.

910
01:25:56,432 --> 01:26:00,287
Adi, if I see you,
I'll kill you.

911
01:26:10,352 --> 01:26:13,527
Hi, you can cut the call now.

912
01:26:13,672 --> 01:26:16,247
Sit, let's eat.

913
01:26:16,752 --> 01:26:19,087
Where did you go?

914
01:26:20,112 --> 01:26:22,927
Can we sit and talk?

915
01:26:27,472 --> 01:26:33,007
Why such an expensive place?
-You won't throw a fit here.

916
01:26:33,392 --> 01:26:35,647
Why did you go
without telling me?

917
01:26:35,912 --> 01:26:38,447
You could have called me.

918
01:26:38,712 --> 01:26:41,767
Would you have lost your pride
if you had informed me?

919
01:26:42,992 --> 01:26:44,567
When I asked your friend,
he said you'd be with...

920
01:26:44,712 --> 01:26:46,287
...your underworld friends.

921
01:26:47,992 --> 01:26:50,407
When I called your sister-in-law,
she is asking me other things.

922
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:53,007
Uncle Ganapathy
did not know anything.

923
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:57,847
Only Aunty Bhavani kept saying
you are around and having dosa.

924
01:26:59,912 --> 01:27:04,087
I couldn't do anything for 2 days.
I even went to the police.

925
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:09,527
What am I to think?
-There is vodka in that.

926
01:27:09,672 --> 01:27:12,247
Don't talk.

927
01:27:15,632 --> 01:27:17,927
Where did you go?

928
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,487
You won't guess.
-Where?

929
01:27:20,632 --> 01:27:23,207
Coimbatore.

930
01:27:23,512 --> 01:27:25,087
Coimbatore?
-Yes.

931
01:27:25,232 --> 01:27:27,407
What for?

932
01:27:29,952 --> 01:27:32,087
My mother?
-Who else?

933
01:27:32,232 --> 01:27:33,927
Would 'Pollachi Mahalinggam'
call me?

934
01:27:34,072 --> 01:27:40,007
She sent someone to get me.
-If she called, why did you go?

935
01:27:41,272 --> 01:27:44,727
Qidft 'Yam <i>F?</i> .93?-

936
01:27:45,352 --> 01:27:48,487
I'm from West Mambalam, I haven't
even seen a private jet before.

937
01:27:48,632 --> 01:27:50,767
A small plane for 6.

938
01:27:50,912 --> 01:27:54,247
The air hostess was a girl from
Assam, Pinky, a tribal beauty.

939
01:27:54,392 --> 01:27:56,247
I was picked up in an Audi 8
from Coimbatore Airport.

940
01:27:56,392 --> 01:27:58,087
Why did she call you?

941
01:27:58,232 --> 01:28:00,927
She showed me her factory,
office, estate, race cars...

942
01:28:01,072 --> 01:28:05,407
...bungalow and everything.
She said, they belonged to you.

943
01:28:05,992 --> 01:28:08,127
What else did she say?
-She asked me...

944
01:28:08,272 --> 01:28:12,727
...what you saw in me.
What did you see in me?

945
01:28:13,632 --> 01:28:15,647
Did she threaten you?

946
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,807
Did she say she knew
all the police officers?

947
01:28:19,512 --> 01:28:22,207
She said that
she's always observing you.

948
01:28:22,352 --> 01:28:25,127
She said that she knew
that you went to Jaipur.

949
01:28:25,352 --> 01:28:29,447
What would you like to eat?
Pasta, pizza or antipasti?

950
01:28:32,552 --> 01:28:36,847
Thank you, we'll be back.

951
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:43,287
I'm very upset.
I look cool from the outside.

952
01:28:43,432 --> 01:28:45,967
Look here.
-I can still hear you.

953
01:28:46,712 --> 01:28:49,247
Are we husband and wife?
Why are we fighting?

954
01:28:49,392 --> 01:28:50,807
Joke of the year!

955
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:53,927
The whole of Mumbai
knows we are fighting.

956

957
01:29:00,072 --> 01:29:03,807
Don't smile, you fool!
Look angry.

958
01:29:05,992 --> 01:29:08,527
Our first argument. I'm going
to upload for the world to see.

959
01:29:08,672 --> 01:29:13,927
Enough? 48 hours,
don't talk to me or look for me.

960
01:30:08,472 --> 01:30:11,567
Don't leave me...

961
01:30:11,712 --> 01:30:15,567
Don't leave me...

962
01:30:15,752 --> 01:30:18,327
Tara, wait!

963
01:30:18,632 --> 01:30:22,767
Don't leave me...

He)' fiery girl...

965
01:31:16,552 --> 01:31:19,927
Fiery girl who hisses...

966
01:31:20,352 --> 01:31:25,767
If you leave,
the poem would be meaningless...

967
01:31:36,392 --> 01:31:39,687
Don't leave me...

968
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:42,007
Don't...

969
01:31:42,992 --> 01:31:45,767
I'm an atheist.
-Shut up and follow me.

970
01:31:45,912 --> 01:31:50,247
I promised Him I'll bring you.
-Even God won't endure this.

971
01:31:50,712 --> 01:31:54,007
Your joke is foolish.

972
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:57,167
He doesn't like jokes?
He looks upset.

973
01:32:11,272 --> 01:32:13,647
Aunty Bhavani!

974
01:32:19,272 --> 01:32:22,207
Aunty Bhavani,
this is too much.

975
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:27,367
What happened? Why are
you sitting in the rain?

976
01:32:27,512 --> 01:32:30,407
Didn't you go home?
-What happened?

977
01:32:30,552 --> 01:32:35,167
I forgot the way.
-To go home?

978
01:32:35,312 --> 01:32:39,527
I forgot the way.
-To go home?

979
01:32:44,512 --> 01:32:47,127
Come on.
-Let's go.

980
01:32:50,912 --> 01:32:53,487
I fell down into the valley...

981
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,807
You took me to the peak...

982
01:32:55,952 --> 01:32:58,327
I fell into the water...

983
01:32:58,472 --> 01:33:01,167
You took me to the shore...

984
01:33:01,352 --> 01:33:03,967
I fell down into the valley...

985
01:33:04,112 --> 01:33:06,367
You took me to the peak...

986
01:33:06,512 --> 01:33:09,047
I fell into the water...

987
01:33:09,432 --> 01:33:12,007
You took me to the shore...

988
01:33:12,152 --> 01:33:14,687
No matter where I fall...

989
01:33:14,832 --> 01:33:17,247
You'll reach out to me...

990
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:20,407
I asked for flowers...

991
01:33:20,552 --> 01:33:22,927
You gave me the park...

992
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,647
I asked for water...

993
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:29,007
You gave me honey...

994
01:33:34,232 --> 01:33:37,847
What did the doctor say?

995
01:33:39,752 --> 01:33:45,127
He said you must listen to me
and take your medicine on time.

996
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:46,967
Don't lie.

997
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:53,607
Someone keeps
yelling inside my head.

998
01:33:54,352 --> 01:33:59,207
I forget what I want to say.
I don't recognise anyone.

999
01:33:59,512 --> 01:34:01,927
I'm forgetting my music.

1000
01:34:02,072 --> 01:34:04,527
How can you lie
that I'll recover?

1001
01:34:05,832 --> 01:34:11,367
They told you to be strong.
-Don't treat me like a fool.

1002
01:34:12,512 --> 01:34:17,687
I'm losing my memory
but I can still think.

1003
01:34:19,032 --> 01:34:22,407
Alzheimer, second stage.

1004
01:34:31,952 --> 01:34:35,847
Will I forget you one day?

1006
01:35:14,872 --> 01:35:19,807
I'm Chandrika, Tara's mother.
We came to discuss marriage.

1007
01:35:22,672 --> 01:35:25,247
Hello, how are you?
-Hey, Bill Gates!

1008
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:28,487
Go to MakeMyTrip.Com...

1009
01:35:28,632 --> 01:35:31,927
...take the first cheapest
flight from Mumbai to Chennai.

1010
01:35:32,072 --> 01:35:33,527
Why?

1011
01:35:33,672 --> 01:35:39,367
Is this why I educated you
and sent you to Mumbai?

1012
01:35:39,792 --> 01:35:42,847
Why?
What's the problem?

1013
01:35:43,152 --> 01:35:45,607
A big problem called Chandrika
is sitting in front of me.

1014
01:35:45,752 --> 01:35:48,087
Who is this Chandrika?

1015
01:35:48,792 --> 01:35:51,887
There is a raaga
called Chandrika Todi.

1016
01:35:54,752 --> 01:35:57,487
Tara's mother.
-Who is Tara?

1017
01:35:57,632 --> 01:36:01,167
Good morning.
-Chandrika's daughter.

1018
01:36:01,312 --> 01:36:04,767
I'm going to smack you!
I don't want this joke from you!

1019
01:36:04,912 --> 01:36:07,487
You told me Tara
was Ganapathy niece.

1020
01:36:08,272 --> 01:36:10,007
Like a niece.

1021
01:36:10,152 --> 01:36:12,287
Once you get to Chennai Airport,
there'll be a pharmacy there.

1022
01:36:12,432 --> 01:36:17,007
Sardarji's shop.
Get 4 BP tablets and come home.

1023
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,527
No, Tara is like
Uncle Ganapathy's niece.

1024
01:36:19,672 --> 01:36:23,247
Ganapathy is old and dim.
He is acting with you.

1025
01:36:23,392 --> 01:36:25,367
Have you become dim?

1026
01:36:25,512 --> 01:36:27,247
Vasu, you won't
find a better girl...

1027
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,167
...than Tara for your brother.

1028
01:36:29,312 --> 01:36:31,327
Sorry, sir,
I didn't know you were there.

1029
01:36:31,472 --> 01:36:33,247
We were talking...

1030
01:36:33,392 --> 01:36:35,167
The dim Ganapathy is talking
to the senseless Vasu.

1031
01:36:35,312 --> 01:36:37,127
Listen up.

1032
01:36:37,272 --> 01:36:38,927
Senseless Vasu!

1033
01:36:39,072 --> 01:36:41,087
Go to Shiva Vishnu
Temple and pray.

1034
01:36:41,232 --> 01:36:42,887
Pray the girl marries
your brother and stays with...

1035
01:36:43,032 --> 01:36:47,127
...him till the end.
-That won't be necessary.

1036
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:49,727
The girl's mother
is here in my house.

1037
01:36:49,872 --> 01:36:53,007
Look.

1038
01:37:11,272 --> 01:37:13,527
Mom!
-Don't be angry.

1039
01:37:27,072 --> 01:37:29,127
Why did you go
and propose marriage?

1040
01:37:29,272 --> 01:37:31,527
Stay on the line.

1041
01:37:36,632 --> 01:37:39,047
Stay on the line.

1042
01:37:39,712 --> 01:37:41,847
Did I say I want to get married?
-Right.

1043
01:37:41,992 --> 01:37:46,687
Why are you interfering?
-Get in!

1044
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:50,567
You live in with a boy.
Must I keep quiet?

1045
01:37:50,712 --> 01:37:52,247
You didn't keep quiet?

1046
01:37:52,432 --> 01:37:55,487
You took him to Coimbatore
and threatened him.

1047
01:37:55,632 --> 01:37:58,207
Don't talk about that.
-I didn't take anyone.

1048
01:37:58,352 --> 01:38:01,447
I didn't threaten anyone.
-Mom, I know everything.

1049
01:38:01,592 --> 01:38:05,807
Tara, I said
I did not threaten anyone.

1050
01:38:06,592 --> 01:38:10,727
Really?
-Is that the problem now?

1051
01:38:10,872 --> 01:38:12,887
When I found out, I told 2
of my friends to investigate.

1052
01:38:13,032 --> 01:38:15,167
That's all.
-Who are they, mom?

1053
01:38:15,312 --> 01:38:18,167
The police commissioner, right?
-There goes!

1054
01:38:18,312 --> 01:38:20,247
Have a daughter,
then you'll know the feeling.

1055
01:38:20,392 --> 01:38:24,367
Is it the police commissioner?
-Tara, our stop is here. Let's go.

1056
01:38:24,872 --> 01:38:26,767
When I found out that you're
in love with the guy...

1057
01:38:26,912 --> 01:38:28,927
...I told them to check out
his education and family.

1058
01:38:29,072 --> 01:38:32,727
You said you went to Coimbatore,
Audi and private jet.

1059
01:38:33,112 --> 01:38:35,487
I saw it, your mom
showed me through Skype.

1060
01:38:38,992 --> 01:38:42,087
But he's from the middle class,
that's not an issue.

1061
01:38:42,232 --> 01:38:45,127
Where were you the 2 days?
-What's the difference?

1062
01:38:45,272 --> 01:38:49,567
Where were you?
-Mother-in-law's house (jail).

1063
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,287
Were you in the lockup?

1064
01:38:54,712 --> 01:38:57,367
Mom, did you make Adi
stay in the lockup?

1065
01:38:57,512 --> 01:39:00,407
Tara, I didn't do anything
against your wish.

1066
01:39:00,552 --> 01:39:02,407
Did you put him
in the lockup or not?

1067
01:39:02,552 --> 01:39:05,367
When I found out you picked
a good guy, I went to their house.

1068
01:39:05,512 --> 01:39:09,527
I fixed your marriage, that's all.
-They took me on Friday.

1069
01:39:09,672 --> 01:39:12,207
I couldn't get
bail until Monday.

1070
01:39:12,352 --> 01:39:14,927
They gave me a feast in jail.

1071
01:39:15,592 --> 01:39:20,167
In the jail?
-There were many VIPs there.

1072
01:39:20,312 --> 01:39:22,767
Mom, I'll call you back.

1073
01:39:27,312 --> 01:39:30,367
The commissioner took me to
his house and gave me breakfast.

1074
01:39:30,672 --> 01:39:33,287
Aloo parottha, yogurt and
pickles. It was great.

1075
01:39:33,432 --> 01:39:34,887
We became friends.

1076
01:39:35,032 --> 01:39:37,207
He said I won't have a problem
during my visa application.

1077
01:39:40,512 --> 01:39:43,687
Why didn't you tell me
my mother did this to you?

1078
01:39:43,832 --> 01:39:45,927
Don't worry
like what Buddy says.

1079
01:39:46,072 --> 01:39:49,287
I used the jail
experience in my game.

1080
01:39:49,432 --> 01:39:52,087
Want to watch the demo?
Come to my office.

1081
01:39:52,232 --> 01:39:54,607
Come on!

1082
01:40:07,232 --> 01:40:13,127
There is no one here.
-I don't know. Where are they?

1083
01:40:44,552 --> 01:40:46,407
I'm like the game...

1084
01:40:46,552 --> 01:40:48,127
Run...

1085
01:40:48,272 --> 01:40:50,807
I'm despicable...

1086
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:54,047
Game...

1087
01:40:58,632 --> 01:41:00,567
<i>Goa or Mumbai...</i>

1088
01:41:00,712 --> 01:41:02,967
<i>Mumbai...</i>

1089
01:41:49,472 --> 01:41:53,327
Adi, my love, come here!

1090
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:59,207
The project
was approved in the US.

1091
01:42:46,352 --> 01:42:50,567
You're going to the US.
It's hard for me.

1092
01:42:51,112 --> 01:42:54,567
How would Tara feel?

1093
01:43:05,072 --> 01:43:08,287
My biggest mistake.
-What?

1094
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:11,527
Tara.

1095
01:43:11,672 --> 01:43:16,287
My little secret...

1096
01:43:16,432 --> 01:43:21,687
My little secret...

1097
01:43:21,992 --> 01:43:25,327
My little wonder...

1098
01:43:30,072 --> 01:43:32,527
Give me your tiny finger...

1099
01:43:32,672 --> 01:43:35,567
Give me a tiny space...

1100
01:43:35,712 --> 01:43:40,087
I can't lie for small desires...

1101
01:43:44,032 --> 01:43:47,487
Shall I reject the US offer?
-Quiet!

1102
01:43:47,632 --> 01:43:49,647
I can't leave Tara behind.

1103
01:43:51,912 --> 01:43:55,727
"Just say it, Adi won't go the US,
he'll stay with you."

1104
01:44:07,672 --> 01:44:12,367
My little secret...

1105
01:44:12,712 --> 01:44:17,287
My little wonder...

1106
01:44:20,392 --> 01:44:23,087
Give me your tiny finger...

1107
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:26,087
Give me a tiny space...

1108
01:44:26,352 --> 01:44:30,407
I can't lie
for small desires...

1109
01:44:31,712 --> 01:44:37,047
Please stop here.
-What happened, Tara?

1110
01:44:42,032 --> 01:44:43,577
How much?
-Rs17

1111
01:44:48,472 --> 01:44:50,967
Why are you upset now?

1112
01:44:51,872 --> 01:44:54,687
I'm sad because
I'm not like you.

1113
01:44:56,032 --> 01:45:01,567
You're going to leave me soon.
Do you feel sad at all?

1114
01:45:01,912 --> 01:45:05,567
You're dancing away happily,
like this and that.

1115
01:45:05,912 --> 01:45:11,287
Why do I feel sad?
-Do you want me to feel sad?

1116
01:45:12,712 --> 01:45:14,367
Did you stop
to think a minute?

1117
01:45:14,512 --> 01:45:18,327
Don't go to Paris,
let's just stay like this.

1118
01:45:19,632 --> 01:45:22,167
Every minute.

1119
01:45:22,472 --> 01:45:25,487
I didn't like it
when I got the admission.

1120
01:45:25,792 --> 01:45:28,607
That is why
I didn't tell you.

1121
01:45:30,192 --> 01:45:32,767
Follow me to the US.

1122
01:45:33,472 --> 01:45:37,007
You follow me to Paris.

1123
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:40,407
That's tough.

1124
01:45:41,272 --> 01:45:44,007
It's tough for me too.

1125
01:45:51,462 --> 01:45:54,157
The best time of my life
were these 6 months.

1126
01:45:54,302 --> 01:45:59,397
When I was with you.
Let's not destroy it.

1127
01:46:02,062 --> 01:46:03,957
Okay-

1128
01:46:04,102 --> 01:46:06,237
What do you mean?

1129
01:46:06,902 --> 01:46:09,957
We'll make an agreement.
-What?

1130
01:46:10,422 --> 01:46:14,197
We have a few days left.
-10 days.

1131
01:46:14,342 --> 01:46:17,077
We can fight, cry,
yell and leave each other.

1132
01:46:17,222 --> 01:46:18,917
We can feel sorry
for each other the next 10 days.

1133
01:46:19,062 --> 01:46:21,637
Or we need not think about
the future, we'll enjoy.

1134
01:46:22,462 --> 01:46:27,077
We shouldn't fight these 10 days,
no matter what happens, okay?

1135
01:46:27,222 --> 01:46:29,637
Promise?
-No crying either.

1136
01:46:29,782 --> 01:46:32,677
There shouldn't be sentiment,
separation or sadness.

1137
01:46:32,982 --> 01:46:34,477
No sleeping.
-Okay.

1138
01:46:34,622 --> 01:46:39,037
We should stay awake.
Laugh, go out and have fun.

1139
01:46:39,182 --> 01:46:43,317
We'll go wild, okay?
-Done.

1140
01:46:43,542 --> 01:46:47,317
Done?
-Done!

1141
01:47:00,862 --> 01:47:02,957
Go fast!

1142
01:47:03,102 --> 01:47:05,757
Hold the steering!

1143
01:47:22,862 --> 01:47:28,237
Assume this is our house.
-All the rooms are our bedrooms.

1144
01:47:28,382 --> 01:47:33,517
One dog, you get scared
when he barks.

1145
01:47:33,662 --> 01:47:35,917
Kids?

1146
01:47:36,222 --> 01:47:39,197
Just for one day,
we'll adopt a child.

1147
01:47:40,342 --> 01:47:45,957
His name, Glutton.
He looks like a sumo wrestler.

1148
01:47:47,462 --> 01:47:52,317
What if its a girl?
-A pretty girl, just like you.

1149
01:48:21,822 --> 01:48:23,677
What will you do
when you go to the US?

1150
01:48:23,822 --> 01:48:25,637
I'll go to a strip club.

1151
01:48:27,982 --> 01:48:30,997
Tell me what I'll do.
-What will you do?

1152
01:48:31,782 --> 01:48:33,357
I don't know.

1153
01:48:33,502 --> 01:48:36,797
I'll waste my time thinking
what you'll be doing.

1154
01:48:57,782 --> 01:49:03,557
Can you listen?
The clock is ticking away.

1155
01:49:03,702 --> 01:49:06,037
Don't think about it.

1156
01:49:08,662 --> 01:49:11,557
Only 8 days left.

1157
01:49:18,342 --> 01:49:21,117
Tell me, "Don't cry, Tara."

1158
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:25,917
Tell me.

1159
01:49:26,302 --> 01:49:29,917


1160
01:49:47,022 --> 01:49:49,117
I'm sleepy.

1161
01:49:49,262 --> 01:49:51,357
If you ask me now,
I'll say something foolish.

1162
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:53,917
Say something nice.

1163
01:49:58,262 --> 01:50:02,037
No, we promised each other
there won't be any sentiment.

1164
01:50:02,502 --> 01:50:04,877
Not this one minute.

1165
01:50:05,022 --> 01:50:07,437
Tell me from the
bottom of your heart.

1166
01:50:08,582 --> 01:50:11,117
Okay, I'll tell you.

1167
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:19,397
How will it be to eat
one hot omelette right now?

1168
01:50:20,982 --> 01:50:23,797
Great.

1169
01:50:23,942 --> 01:50:26,557
You're right.

1170
01:50:58,782 --> 01:51:01,357
Remove the chain
from your neck.

1171
01:51:01,502 --> 01:51:04,077
Quick, remove it.

1172
01:51:24,022 --> 01:51:25,437
I love you.

1173
01:51:25,582 --> 01:51:28,517
Hey! I love you.

1174
01:51:28,662 --> 01:51:31,397
I didn't think you're the
sort who buys gifts.

1175
01:51:31,542 --> 01:51:35,117
It was an accident.
Forgive me, Kanmani.

1176
01:51:36,862 --> 01:51:40,037
Are you settling
your accounts before we go?

1177
01:51:40,182 --> 01:51:42,117
Is that it?

1178
01:51:43,462 --> 01:51:45,437
Tara?
-Then what?

1179
01:51:45,582 --> 01:51:47,717
You've never given me a gift.

1180
01:51:47,862 --> 01:51:50,317
If you don't like it,
we'll return it back.

1181
01:51:50,462 --> 01:51:53,077
Must we fight
in front of these pigeons?

1182
01:51:53,422 --> 01:51:58,037
You're telling me to let you go,
you wrapped and brought it here.

1183
01:52:03,182 --> 01:52:05,877
She will not fight with me.

1184
01:52:07,942 --> 01:52:11,037
You're closing
Tara Kalingarayar's chapter.

1185
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:16,197
She will not scold me.
She will remain sweet.

1186
01:52:16,342 --> 01:52:18,517
I'm telling you
how I feel, Adi.

1187
01:52:18,662 --> 01:52:20,477
You're bottling up
your feeling...

1188
01:52:20,622 --> 01:52:23,077
...you're discarding me
with a smiling face.

1189
01:52:29,702 --> 01:52:35,197
You knew you would have
to say goodbye, love...

1190
01:52:38,262 --> 01:52:43,317
But my love for you
will not reduce...

1191
01:52:49,062 --> 01:52:51,637
Sorry.

1192
01:52:57,822 --> 01:53:00,397
Is this pretty?

1193
01:53:03,702 --> 01:53:09,437
My boyfriend bought it for me.
Do you like it?

1194
01:54:05,182 --> 01:54:08,237
I thought we promised
each other that we won't cry.

1195
01:54:08,582 --> 01:54:10,397
I'm not crying.

1196
01:54:10,542 --> 01:54:12,037
Then what is flowing out
from your eyes?

1197
01:54:12,182 --> 01:54:14,917
Happiness?
-Okay, so what?

1198
01:54:15,062 --> 01:54:17,597
Focus on the road.
Don't look at me.

1199
01:54:17,742 --> 01:54:20,477
Let me do whatever I want.

1200
01:54:20,622 --> 01:54:23,357
Even if I look in front,
I can still hear you crying.

1201
01:54:23,502 --> 01:54:27,717
You keep finding my fault.
Whatever I do is wrong.

1202
01:54:27,982 --> 01:54:30,157
I did not mean that.
-You are.

1203
01:54:30,302 --> 01:54:33,797
Okay, I'm not saying anything.
Zip!

1204
01:54:36,382 --> 01:54:39,277
Uncle Ganapathy is preparing
dinner for you today.

1205
01:54:39,422 --> 01:54:41,877
He told me not to eat out,
he wants you home.

1206
01:54:42,022 --> 01:54:46,037
He told me too.
-Don't pick on me during dinner.

1207
01:54:46,182 --> 01:54:50,117
When did I do that?
-I only said don't pick on me.

1208
01:54:50,262 --> 01:54:52,957
Did I say you did it?
-Why are you fighting now?

1209
01:54:53,102 --> 01:54:57,597
Okay, I won't say
anything. Zip!

1210
01:55:23,182 --> 01:55:25,637
Aunty Bhavani!

1211
01:55:29,742 --> 01:55:32,037
Uncle Ganapathy!

1212
01:55:32,182 --> 01:55:34,797
Aunty Bhavani!
-Uncle Ganapathy!

1213
01:55:40,502 --> 01:55:42,877
I'll go down and look.
-I'll come with you.

1214
01:55:48,142 --> 01:55:50,157
Did you see Uncle Ganapathy?
-Aunty went off alone.

1215
01:55:50,302 --> 01:55:53,557
We don't know where she went.
He went to look for her.

1216
01:56:10,702 --> 01:56:15,477
Stop! Go slow!

1217
01:56:15,622 --> 01:56:18,157
It's not them.

1218
01:56:23,782 --> 01:56:25,397
Try calling Uncle Ganapathy.

1219
01:56:25,542 --> 01:56:29,197
His phone is charging at home.
-We made a mistake.

1220
01:56:29,502 --> 01:56:32,037
We should have convinced uncle
to leave aunty in a hospital.

1221
01:56:32,182 --> 01:56:35,157
Aunty said she won't go
to the hospital anymore.

1222
01:56:36,022 --> 01:56:38,317
That's what she'll say.
-Uncle will listen to you...

1223
01:56:38,462 --> 01:56:40,997
...or to aunty?
-She even forgets...

1224
01:56:41,142 --> 01:56:43,717
...who is Uncle Ganapathy.

1225
01:56:43,862 --> 01:56:46,957
Why did he listen to her?

1226
01:56:55,062 --> 01:56:57,517
Wait in the car. Do something
if you see the police.

1227
01:56:57,662 --> 01:57:00,037
I'll go and look.

1228
01:57:06,022 --> 01:57:09,797
Aunty Bhavani!

1229
01:57:16,542 --> 01:57:18,877
Aunty Bhavani!

1230
01:57:28,502 --> 01:57:32,877
She is...
Where did she go?

1231
01:57:38,102 --> 01:57:41,397
One minute, sir. My wife...
-Go!

1232
01:57:41,542 --> 01:57:43,397
It's an emergency, she's missing,
I'm looking for her.

1233
01:57:43,542 --> 01:57:46,557
You cannot wait here!
-Tara!

1234
01:57:47,022 --> 01:57:48,837
Move!

1235
01:57:50,262 --> 01:57:51,997
Go!

1236
01:58:30,542 --> 01:58:33,277
Only you can open
from inside.

1237
01:58:36,702 --> 01:58:38,557
Where did you go?
-I was looking in the market.

1238
01:58:38,702 --> 01:58:40,237
I told you not to leave.

1239
01:58:40,382 --> 01:58:43,477
Only you have a right to search?
What if she was in the market?

1240
01:58:44,502 --> 01:58:48,517
Can't you wait for 2 minutes?
-The police yelled at me in Hindi.

1241
01:58:48,662 --> 01:58:52,957
You can't handle a constable.
But you're scolding me.

1242
01:58:54,822 --> 01:58:56,917
Go left.

1243
01:58:59,142 --> 01:59:01,557
I told you to go left.
-it's a no entry zone.

1244
01:59:01,702 --> 01:59:03,877
Then go around.
-That's what I'm doing.

1245
01:59:04,022 --> 01:59:07,077
Why are you yelling?
You're leaving for the US.

1246
01:59:07,222 --> 01:59:09,237
Then you can shout
anyway you want.

1247
01:59:09,382 --> 01:59:12,397
I'll do anything I want.
Just leave me alone.

1248
01:59:20,342 --> 01:59:22,237
Are you blind?

1249
01:59:22,382 --> 01:59:27,277
Yes, scold me,
that's what I need.

1250
01:59:32,782 --> 01:59:35,397
Uncle Ganapathy!

1251
01:59:37,422 --> 01:59:40,877
Uncle Ganapathy!

1252
01:59:42,382 --> 01:59:45,757
Uncle Ganapathy!

1253
01:59:46,862 --> 01:59:49,837
Who are you?

1254
01:59:54,822 --> 01:59:56,237
You jumped from the car?

1255
01:59:56,382 --> 01:59:57,837
Someone looked
like Uncle Ganapathy.

1256
01:59:57,982 --> 01:59:59,757
Get in!

1257
02:00:03,062 --> 02:00:04,677
Close the door.

1258
02:00:04,822 --> 02:00:08,077
Slowly.
-Why are you jumping at me?

1259
02:00:08,222 --> 02:00:10,397
I'm scared just like you.

1260
02:00:10,542 --> 02:00:12,197
If you jump from the car
while it's moving...

1261
02:00:12,342 --> 02:00:13,997
...won't I get angry?

1262
02:00:14,142 --> 02:00:15,837
What if the bus had hit you?
-Nothing happened.

1263
02:00:15,982 --> 02:00:18,037
You can't say anything
once it happens.

1264
02:00:18,982 --> 02:00:21,517
Okay, drop me here. I'll go
on my own and look for them.

1265
02:00:21,662 --> 02:00:23,797
Then who is going
to look for you?

1266
02:00:23,942 --> 02:00:26,037
What now?

1267
02:00:26,182 --> 02:00:28,317
You were worried that
I would have got hit just now.

1268
02:00:28,662 --> 02:00:30,437
Then who will go to Paris?

1269
02:00:30,582 --> 02:00:33,237
If you care about me,
just say so.

1270
02:00:33,382 --> 02:00:36,277
Why are you yelling?
-Who is yelling now?

1271
02:00:40,462 --> 02:00:44,797
Why are you going home?
-To check if they are back.

1272
02:00:50,662 --> 02:00:53,917
Is Aunty Bhavani back?
-No.

1273
02:01:07,022 --> 02:01:09,597
Don't cry.
-Aunty Bhavani...

1274
02:01:09,742 --> 02:01:12,357
...forgets who she is.

1275
02:01:12,502 --> 02:01:14,397
What if she
forgets the way home?

1276
02:01:14,542 --> 02:01:16,477
How will we look for her?

1277
02:01:16,622 --> 02:01:18,837
You won't be able
to find her by crying.

1278
02:01:18,982 --> 02:01:20,997
Can we find her
if I don't cry?

1279
02:01:21,142 --> 02:01:24,517
I'll do what I want.
Don't bother about me

1280
02:01:24,822 --> 02:01:27,677
Look around while you cry.

1281
02:01:27,822 --> 02:01:30,717
Okay?
"Okay

1282
02:01:47,502 --> 02:01:49,837
Pity Uncle Ganapathy.

1283
02:01:50,542 --> 02:01:53,237
No one will look
after her like he does.

1284
02:01:53,382 --> 02:01:57,277
Not true.
-Why? He doesn't do a good job?

1285
02:01:57,422 --> 02:01:59,837
Is that why Aunty Bhavani
goes missing all the time?

1286
02:02:00,382 --> 02:02:03,197
No, others can
look after her just like him.

1287
02:02:06,422 --> 02:02:08,837
Are you talking about yourself?

1288
02:02:11,862 --> 02:02:13,957
I'm being general.

1289
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:20,917
Can you be like him?
-Yes.

1290
02:02:21,982 --> 02:02:25,237
What if I become like
Aunty Bhavani when I'm old?

1291
02:02:25,382 --> 02:02:27,837
I'll look after you.

1292
02:02:30,262 --> 02:02:35,557
Will you?
What do you mean?

1293
02:02:37,302 --> 02:02:39,917
I'm telling you
not to leave me.

1294
02:02:43,142 --> 02:02:45,837
I'm asking you to marry me.

1295
02:02:45,982 --> 02:02:49,997
You can go anywhere, you can
go to Paris for all I care.

1296
02:02:50,142 --> 02:02:52,757
But marry me first.

1297
02:03:05,182 --> 02:03:08,117
Will you do it?

1298
02:03:22,702 --> 02:03:26,477
There she is.

1299
02:03:31,662 --> 02:03:34,957
Aunty Bhavani!

1300
02:03:55,302 --> 02:03:58,117
Aunty Bhavani!

1301
02:04:06,382 --> 02:04:08,917
Where is Ganapathy?
-He is here.

1302
02:04:10,342 --> 02:04:12,717
Where is Ganapathy?
-He is at home.

1303
02:04:12,862 --> 02:04:15,357
Let's go.

1304
02:04:38,942 --> 02:04:44,877
Ganapathy, where did you go?
I was worried about you.

1305
02:04:46,462 --> 02:04:48,717
I searched all over for you.

1306
02:04:49,342 --> 02:04:54,317
I won't do it again, Bhavani.
Let's go.

1307
02:05:30,022 --> 02:05:34,317
SQ?

1308
02:05:37,142 --> 02:05:39,877
You said something
in the car.

1309
02:05:43,622 --> 02:05:45,957
I'll say it again.

1310
02:05:49,902 --> 02:05:51,957
Really?

1311
02:05:52,102 --> 02:05:55,037
Yes.

1312
02:05:57,422 --> 02:06:00,757
Do you want
to get married to me?

1313
02:06:09,782 --> 02:06:12,677
You don't have
to stop studying.

1314
02:06:12,822 --> 02:06:15,757
You can still go to Paris.

1315
02:06:16,222 --> 02:06:18,877
But marry me before you go.

1316
02:06:20,342 --> 02:06:24,037
I'll come and join you.

1317
02:06:33,182 --> 02:06:35,597
Really?

1318
02:06:35,742 --> 02:06:39,197
Yes.

1319
02:06:39,462 --> 02:06:41,997
Marriage?

1320
02:06:42,142 --> 02:06:44,397
Marriage.

1321
02:06:45,102 --> 02:06:47,357
100%?

1322
02:06:47,502 --> 02:06:49,917
Yes.

1323
02:06:54,662 --> 02:06:56,797
Okay-

1324
02:06:58,022 --> 02:07:00,877
Okay?

1325
02:07:01,622 --> 02:07:04,117
Okay-

1326
02:07:06,462 --> 02:07:08,477
Okay, Kanmani!

1327
02:07:08,622 --> 02:07:11,237
With an insane heart...

1328
02:07:11,382 --> 02:07:14,117
Young and naughty...

1329
02:07:14,262 --> 02:07:17,037
With a beautiful tune...

1330
02:07:17,182 --> 02:07:19,917
Okay on my girl's lap...

1331
02:07:20,062 --> 02:07:22,397
With an insane heart...

1332
02:07:22,542 --> 02:07:25,237
Young and naughty...

1333
02:07:25,382 --> 02:07:28,197
With a beautiful tune...

1334
02:07:28,342 --> 02:07:31,237
Okay on my girl's lap...

1335
02:07:31,582 --> 02:07:33,957
Yesterday is gone...

1336
02:07:34,102 --> 02:07:36,837
Tomorrow is a pain...

1337
02:07:36,982 --> 02:07:39,637
Just like my Laila...

1338
02:07:39,782 --> 02:07:42,877
We're the king
and queen today...

1339
02:07:43,022 --> 02:07:45,797
With an insane heart...

1340
02:07:45,942 --> 02:07:48,357
Young and naughty...

1341
02:07:48,502 --> 02:07:51,197
With a beautiful tune...

1342
02:07:51,342 --> 02:07:54,477
Okay on my girl's lap...

1343
02:08:14,382 --> 02:08:17,157
Don't pinch with your eyes...

1344
02:08:17,302 --> 02:08:19,997
Don't go without disturbing...

1345
02:08:20,142 --> 02:08:22,917
Don't jump when I touch...

1346
02:08:23,062 --> 02:08:27,077
Don't go
even if I leave you...

1347
02:08:29,022 --> 02:08:34,397
Marriage, wife and in-laws...

1348
02:08:34,542 --> 02:08:37,277
Girl and boy...

1349
02:08:37,422 --> 02:08:40,517
Love...

1350
02:08:40,662 --> 02:08:43,357
With an insane heart...

1351
02:08:43,502 --> 02:08:45,957
Young and naughty...

1352
02:08:46,102 --> 02:08:48,797
With a beautiful tune...

1353
02:08:48,942 --> 02:08:51,997
Okay on my girl's lap...

1354
02:08:52,142 --> 02:08:54,717
With an insane heart...

1355
02:08:54,862 --> 02:08:57,477
Young and naughty...

1356
02:08:57,862 --> 02:09:00,037
With a beautiful tune...

1357
02:09:00,422 --> 02:09:03,517
Okay on my girl's lap...

1358
02:09:03,662 --> 02:09:06,117
Yesterday is gone...

1359
02:09:06,262 --> 02:09:08,957
Tomorrow is a pain...

1360
02:09:09,102 --> 02:09:11,797
Just like my Laila...

1361
02:09:11,942 --> 02:09:15,037
We're the king
and queen today...

1362
02:09:17,782 --> 02:09:21,677
Just like your Laila...

1363
02:09:23,782 --> 02:09:26,237
We got married...

1364
02:09:26,382 --> 02:09:28,957
I give you permission...

1365
02:09:29,102 --> 02:09:31,997
I keep stepping forward...

1366
02:09:32,142 --> 02:09:36,437
<i>I fall on your lap...</i>

1367
02:09:38,182 --> 02:09:40,677
We may go separate ways...

1368
02:09:40,822 --> 02:09:43,677
But unknowingly,
we are always one...

1369
02:09:43,822 --> 02:09:46,357
At times we laugh...

1370
02:09:46,502 --> 02:09:49,357
We fly most of the time...

1371
02:09:49,502 --> 02:09:52,477
With an insane heart...

1372
02:09:52,622 --> 02:09:54,997
Young and naughty...

1373
02:09:55,142 --> 02:09:58,237
With a beautiful tune...

1374
02:09:58,382 --> 02:10:00,997
Okay on my girl's lap...

1375
02:10:01,302 --> 02:10:03,997
With an insane heart...

1376
02:10:04,142 --> 02:10:06,837
Young and naughty...

1377
02:10:06,982 --> 02:10:09,717
With a beautiful tune...

1378
02:10:09,862 --> 02:10:12,597
Okay on my girl's lap...

1379
02:10:12,742 --> 02:10:15,477
Yesterday is gone...

1380
02:10:15,622 --> 02:10:18,077
Tomorrow is a pain...

1381
02:10:18,222 --> 02:10:21,037
Just like your Laila...

1382
02:10:21,182 --> 02:10:24,077
We're the king
and queen today...

1383
02:10:24,222 --> 02:10:26,957
With an insane heart...

1384
02:10:27,102 --> 02:10:29,717
Young and naughty...

1385
02:10:29,862 --> 02:10:32,717
With a beautiful tune...

1386
02:10:32,862 --> 02:10:35,837
Okay on my girl's lap...

1387
02:10:45,862 --> 02:10:49,797
Like your Laila...

1388
02:10:51,622 --> 02:10:55,437
Like your Laila...

1389
02:10:54,622 --> 02:11:32,437
