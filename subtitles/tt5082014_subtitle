To marry Kuruvila, and

''At a distance..''

105
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,144
So, this is the place it's a heritage

106
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,653
To climb the step, turn left

107
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,390
Again to climb step, turn right

108
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,356
By then the step will be finished

109
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,086
So, there is no need of
help from me, no?

110
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,025

stage a foot dance on chest

111
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,662
Okay see you then

112

00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,201
lt is me..Ammini!
Ammini!

114
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,513
Are you standing here?

115
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,123
The person out here
had purchased Ammini

116
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,121
For my daughterto play

117
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,156
On that day he left, l
couldn't come to take her

118
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,486
l was hospitalised,
reached today only

119
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,828
There is a person waiting for
you at the hut, Ummukolusu!

120
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,486
Usman Ekka, l don't want your room

121
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,585
Sister tell what has happened?
Tell the matter

122
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,489
When l came here one person
had come and taken his goat

123
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,457
Only that much,
that's our Ammini isn't it?

124
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,098
She was taken
by our goat Abutikka

125
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,235
His heart is so tender
like goat's milk

126
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,199
There is no relation between the
photo you send and with this room

127
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,133
There is no lockable door,
the room isn't properly cleaned

128
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,642
l had told you to come after a
week when the room gets ready

129
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,339
You came in a haste and telling
like this, that itself is wrong

130
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,510
Everything will be ready

131
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,244
Will anyone turn up
asking for goat and cow?

132
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,553
Now who is there to come?
Now only he has to come!

133
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,557
He has left, no? Only
god knows when he will come

134
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,005
How is it going over there?

135
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,878
lt was bit of a problem,
the house wasn't cleaned

136
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,610
Girl, your mother had called me,
l didn't pick up the phone

137
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,511
You can just do some tricks and
escape, l'm the one to answer

138
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,020
l'll call you back okay

139
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:45,393
Banana, jaggery without
salt, to brew paddy is good

140
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,360
lt is simply the best
to pour and drink!

141
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,362
lt will run through the throat

142
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,229
Hello, who are you?

143
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,234

00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,036
My Christ when did he do this?

145
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,311
From a long time l have
been saying don't be a bachelor

146
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,982
At that time will tell big
dialogue, l don't need a girl

147
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,348

Now when it whistles
it is so sweet to hear

154
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,004
lsn't it a spiritual whistling?

155
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:33,811
What is this? Hello, tell your
kids will break like crackers

156
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,644
They will whack you to pulp!

157

Me? Right now l'm in a forest
What, in a forest?

168
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,813
Like in stories which Rachel used to
say, a magician's den is there, no?

169
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,082
Like that in a den

170
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,875

Sir, l'm unmarried - Even if you marry

No sir, l won't go
You don't marry

00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,487
You don't need this 'thing'
Honestly, l won't go

00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,665
You go to kitchen and
take that beef Vindaloo

What is it? - You go to kitchen
and take that beef Vindaloo

Come on sit man

233
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,405
Mr. Dezuza!
Sir, l'm Sunni, thief Sunni!

234
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,974
Fellow what a crapy name is this?

235
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,667
Fellow even Kerala Congress
people have better name, than this

236
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,673
The name should have a power!

237
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,240
Karl Max, Rosa Luxemburg!

238
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,147
V.S Achuthanandhan, VSOP!

239
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,513
This is simply Suni Kuttan! From
today onwards you are Dezuza

240
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,226
Dezuza, were you
caught by police, any time?

241
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,723
For the first time?
Yeah

242
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:31,194
Forthe first time, when l was 18
years of age, l went to steal

243
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:35,203
When l went there at night that sir
was lying on the bed without cloths

244
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,002
Very near to him,
sir's wife was sleeping

245
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,410
lf that sister wakes
up, thinking that -

246
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,011
- she shouldn't get
scared on seeing sir's 'thing'

247
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,408
l stripped off my
cloth and clothed him

248
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,244
Suddenly that sister woke up
and on seeing me she got scared

249
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,210
What? Got scared on seeing you?

250
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,550
She didn't get scared but laughed!

251
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,423
Just like this that sister also laughed!

252
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,390
On hearing that,
that brother woke up

253
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,530
When brother woke
up, saw me and sister standing

254
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,360
Without saying anything to anyone,
that sirjailed me on a false charge

255
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,968
Honestly l went to steal, there
wasn't any kind of illicit relationship

256
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:11,200
And how long were you jailed?
For 8 to 9 months l was inside

257
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,640
ln nut shell it is a
pregnancy period, isn't it?

258
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,706
Mr. Dezuza, what do you
want from here?

259
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,606
Sir, aren't you killing me?

260
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,650
To kill another person,
Mr.Dezuza who has got the rights?

261
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:27,582
That's great, same catchy dialogue
which is said in 'Quran and Seeta'

262
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,294
Seeta?
Geeta!

263
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,529

264
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,595
My goodness it is 2 O'clock sir, l

265
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,801

To where? -Along with you

267
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,440
With me for a robbery?

268
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,711
Sir, you try to go and sleep,
then what? - Hold on fellow!

269
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,615
To come here you don't
need anyone's permission

270
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:56,676
But to return, my son!

On changing the dress, where
are you going? ls it for a movie?

274
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,727
Not for a movie but to see
a 'bride to be', for you

275
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,600
Then put some spray

276
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:18,298
''On the this calm night

277
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,807

Man, l don't have any job

284
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,069
Then can't you clean that
house when you are free?

285
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,498
Even the scrap pickers will
get frightened on seeing it

286
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,297
Even l got scared

287
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:53,240

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,495
l'll clean it myself
lt's totally messy!

344
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,601
A sort of mood out
Was he staying here?

345
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,962
ls it?

346
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,608
What is it?
Balance of a story from here

347
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,210
Girl, what is this?

348
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,809
Have you come here to
learn music or to read a book?

349
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,141
That Kuruvila had called me

350
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,577
Where did he get the number?
From your mother

351
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,550
You leave that story
and Kuruvila and be happy

352
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,088
Shall leave the Kuruvila,
but the story is good

353
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,187
Look this story and life they are
two different extremes, okay

354
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,029
Look the boat is leaving
Hey fellow, stop there

355
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,601
Don't throw
Stop there l say

356
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,703
Telling you to stop there
Don't make me run like this

357
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,031
Sister save, don't move
Just move back, let me catch him

358
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,538
Sister which is the perfume?

359
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,175
Let me catch him

360
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,177
There, he escaped again

361
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,682
Come, come hold my hand

362
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,508
Come

363
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,219
PC catch him

364
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,925
Hey stop there
Don't jump

365
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:50,960
He is a cool guy he
had a deadly scooter with him

366
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:54,221
For a foreignerfrom Spain
l had told a price for the scooter

367
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,862
My god, only that mad
man knows how we escaped?

368
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,629
Can you find him?
What to find?

369
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:04,807
Can you look out for him?
He is beyond my reach

370
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,936
Did you recognise
anyone among this?

371
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:11,644
What is this goat figure?
This is like our goat Abutikka

372
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:16,983
Then this one, it is very familiar
but can't get the focus

373
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,189
Will get it where else
to go otherthan to get?

374
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,528
Yeah, this is the house

375
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,033
Okay then l'm not staying, from
Germany one client is waiting

376
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:41,768
Okay then see you
Okay

377
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,607
l was not in station had to undergo
certain difficulties of that, isn't it?

378
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,319
Rahiya, water
Father coming

379
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,121
By the way why did you
say, you wanted to meet me?

380
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,759
Well, Usman Ekka, who was
staying in that room earlier

381
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,655
Sister that is a 'Genie'

382
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,194
That is why l told l'll clean
the room and then you occupy

383
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:06,260
Spirit got into you, isn't it?
That is, thanks

384
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,172
From there l got
a comic, l got a story

385
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,171
To know what is the
remaining part of it one curiosity

386
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,968
lf l could just meet that person

387
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,841
Sister are you mad to
find the rest of story?

388
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,040
Look, when that person
came here he had drawn this

389
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,845
l haven't asked what is the
remaining part of this, he hasn't told

390
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,655
This is Pathumma's home
Where is Ummukolusu's home?

391
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,222
Ummukolusu's home, no?
Yeah!

392
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,162
Shall do it now

393
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,747
Do you know where this person is
at present? - Don't ask that, only

394
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,617
He will give an unexpected visit
That is his way of doing

395
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,725
Can't say when he will come

396
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,319
To contact is there any way?

397
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,961
No phone to call no address
to write letter, nothing is there

398
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,791
lf he comes here,
he will visit David's home

399
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,231
Only after touching there
he will go to any other place

400
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,900
Saying there are angels
on the attic of the church

401
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,077
During childhood
you had gone in search of it

402
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,370
My Rachael, it's not like that

403
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,106
These are some of the
astonishing sketches

404
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:27,081
Then the room l stay, that thief and
that person, are the characters in tale

405
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,015
Don't keep searching and
go to a far off place, okay

406
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,279
Your brother is calling
me and asking the number

407
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,922
My goodness, don't give that okay

408
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,025
l'll tell, l'm going to meet
a person, don't disturb

409
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,354
Okay then

410
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,273
Mr. David?

411
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,477
'Demise'

412
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,849
'Demise'

413
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:46,129
'Demise - Charlie (1981 - 2014)

414
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,293
'Demise - Charlie (1981 - 2014)

415
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,257
Compatriots say that he is mad

416
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,360
Sometimes l also feel that
he is really lunatic!

417
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,999
Otherwise will anyone in
the world do such a thing?

418
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,762
What is this?

419
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,173
What fellow? Are you
making people a fool?

420
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,936
Doctor, you don't get perplexed
Look, you don't talk, more

421
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:37,514
Hey Panikkar doctor he celebrated
his birthday in his own way!

422
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,248
You don't talk!
You can't be corrected!

423
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,941
Now, what is your problem?
Hasn't he died?

424
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,485
Or gave an ad that he
is dead, which is the issue?

425
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,378
Yes man, is my
wish to see him dead?

426
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,488
Don't make a scene

427
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:51,885
Sir, what is this? lf the elder
people start doing like this?

428
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:53,794
Come on sit
Leave me

429
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:59,094
Won't allow to booze
and eat peacefully!

430
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,965
Simply creating issues

431
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,945
Pal!
Pal, have a drink

432
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,547
Yeah!

433
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:17,379
Pal, people coming to
know the death of mine -

434
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,250
- to feel and see that
curiosity l have put that ad

435
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:24,984
'A game with death'
its a real feeling!

436
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:30,494
l got so much thrilled, it was a
feeling as if l'm on a 'giant wheel'

437
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:36,598
lf we become a 'dead body' on
taking a census, will know who will come

438
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,102
But there some 'exclusive people'
which we may not know

439
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,078
'Certain unexpected people'

440
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,939
Kathrenamma, had
come from 'Venni Mala'

441
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,478
She was really sick
but she is a beautiful child

442
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,924
A small child, she is aged 83

443
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,456
She had come along
with younger son

444
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:03,258
Then there was 'Das' he is blind

445
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,864
The vision is inside, he
is a singer in the train

446
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,404
'The train Das'

447
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,533
Then came Chandran

448
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,939
All whacked me nicely

449
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,075
Look there is no place left on
this body without a whack!

450
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:25,181
lt is out of love, pal like
you all loves me a lot

451
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,987
Now you tell, upon dying can
we experience any of these?

452
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:36,489
For making you upset, what
should l give? Come on tell

453
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,997
Do you want to beat me again?
Go on beat

''My wife's home
is on a hill of moon''

''On visiting there, will serve
with coffee, black coffee''

456
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,484
Lot of people had come

457
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,595
All the people who came were
served with liquor and food -

458
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,692
- which he made, till morning it
was full of singing and enjoyment

459
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,407
Why, did you get scared?

460
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,571
So, you are staying in the place
where he stayed, aren't you?

461
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,684
Can't say from where and all
people come searching for him

462
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,544
Some people from
Belgium, some from Bangalore

463
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,120
Some people from some orphanage

464
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,348
On the previous day
few people had come to beat him

465
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,520
But forthe first time, a
girl comes searching for him

466
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,225
Okay then

467
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:49,330
Look, does he know that such an
insane person is searching on him?

468
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,737
Don't know

469

Sorry brother, please, please, no

482
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,117
That was on the previous
'Ambu' festival at night

00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,722
So, for the next 'Ambu' festival after
getting rid of daughter's sickness

513
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,792
We will together go to church
Did you hear, Annamma?

514
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,556
Pathrose come
Are you going?

515
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,924
We'll go and come fast,
daughter you may sleep

516
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:56,969
Sir, stop the vehicle

517
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:58,778
Come on, stop

518
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,797
Sir, you take this

519
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:25,667
Thinking of daughter only came
to show the mermaid at night

520
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,072
And sir, don't show this kind of
filthy act to me, okay

521
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,709
Sir, if you want to do
that take a room in any lodge

522
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:33,780
Pathrose what's your problem? ls
it that child, sitting inside the car?.

523
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,586
Pathrose, that is our own child

524
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,911
Pathrose, you may also see
her as your own child

525
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,014
Sir, that is not possible,
sir you take this

526
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,724
Pathrose your daughter who is sick,
when she says she wants to see stars

527
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:46,987
What will Pathrose, do?

528
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:50,356
Won't you show the entire
stars spread on the sky?

529
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,033
This is also just like that

530
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,894
When this child told, she wants to
go to mid sea and wants to see mermaid

531
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,664
We should fulfil that wish no?

532
00:52:56,873 --> 00:53:00,570
A small wish - My sir l have been
going to this sea for 16 years

533
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,904
So far l have not seen the mermaid

534
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,082
What if, if you see one today?
My sir, all this is just a feeling

535
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,748
Pathrose, everything is a feeling

536
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,682
What if, if you and me
are the feelings of someone?

537
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,656
Look here, a mermaid
who has come to the shore

538
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,957
What looks she has got
Come

539
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:29,632
This is Pathrose
This is Queen Mary

540
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,000
Stop kidding sir

541
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,800
My name is Mariyam

542
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,911
Only this sir calls me Queen Marry

543
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,811
My name is Mathai

544
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,787
Sir, check the salt

545
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:52,059
Why salt? My dear salt, when
we are in the middle of salt

546
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,988
By the way, why one wish that
you want to see the sea at night?

547
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,997
That is all simply created by this sir

548
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:03,195
One dialogue to me, if
someone had shown herthe sea

549
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,030
Can l stay still hearing that?

550
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,540
That is why took her at night

551
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:11,041
Pathrose, pour one
she is very shy person

552
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,226
My goodness, look sir!
Mermaid!

553
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:38,596
That is the shape of the deity
who come to watch the sea

554
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,070
Christ!
That will roam in the sea

555
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,975
Christ is telling to the sea, to protect
the people in the sea and in the shore

556
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:48,707
Then will also tell to
the fish, to enter inside the net

557
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,443
Only if the Christ says,
only then will the sea listen

558
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:04,625
Sir, who is this lady? - She
is 'Mariyam' of 'Madalena'

559
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,199
So, sir are you the Christ?

560
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,167
Pathrose, what is the time?

561
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:16,576
As per the calculation it
must be 12 O'clock - Exactly

562
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,213
Exactly
Are you sure? - Sure

563
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,743
Then take the knife
Come, come fast

564
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:27,212
Queen Marry, Mary Kutty
Get up

565
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:31,787
Pathrose, take that knife
Hold this knife

566
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,021
Hold the knife

567
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:38,090
'Dear one, live like a
tide which is tireless'

568
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,826
'Have the longevity like the sea'

569
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,996
Now, you cut the cake

570
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,541
Come on cut it
What is this, Mary?

571
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,701
My beautiful child, this sea
doesn't want the salt of your tears

572
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:24,910
Be happy, this life is long
and spread all along, isn't it?

573
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:39,861
''A bright wave, a small wave
that understands the mind''

574
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:44,999
''A small wave, culminates to a big
wave, a wave that showers the pearls''

575
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:50,171
''The wave which has seen seven seas,
the wave which has seen this earth''

576
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:56,044
''There is a wave within me,
there is a wave within you''

577
00:56:56,279 --> 00:57:00,045
''Dance gracefully, you beside me''

578
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,844
''With your hands''

579
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,581
''Caress the heart''

580
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:11,286
''A bright wave, a small wave
that understands the mind''

581
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:16,357
''A small wave, culminates to a big wave,
a wave that showers the pearls''

582
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:22,932
''At a distance spreading the silver
net, the moon roves the boat here''

583
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:27,668
''Are you searching the treasure
under the sea at night?''

584
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:33,243
''When the milky white rays
of that moon light spreads''

585
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:38,178
''Down below, the honey
waves of a song is spread''

586
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:43,759
''Somewhere a bird is
wounded in the wings''

587
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,294
''The silky waves is withered in
pain, silky waves renders the chill''

588
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:53,068
''To musicate the entire soul, with
honey a whole series of rhythms''

589
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,068
Pathrose - Yeah
Have you seen the heroine of 'Titanic?'

590
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:05,111
An innocent lady, a filthy
jerk has married her

591
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,416
From the next day after
wedding, he started pimping

592
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,419
All these years, he made
money by selling Mary

593
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:17,324
Two weeks back Mary had
a fever, on testing the blood

594
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,758
Came to know that it is a
disease without cure

595
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,156
lts Aids

596
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,997
Pathrose, pour one
more to child Marry

597
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,788
Mary!
Mary!

598
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,390
Mary!
Sir, Mary!

599
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:14,450
That person? -As soon as
Marry jumped, he also jumped

600
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:18,709
The sea will hook you
down to the sea bed

601
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,889
She jumped to die, how to get her?.

602
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:28,055
After a long time, he came swimming
and sat at the verge of the boat

603
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,960
Without saying anything
he cried for a long time

604
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:33,499
For the first time and for the last
time, l had seen him on that day

605
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,435
l don't know when he
drew all this pictures

606
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:38,968
Father

00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,811
She is my daughter, sometimes

608
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,503
He was a special person
Careful

609
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,548
Father, who is this?

610
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,511
Other day, one uncle has
shown you magic, isn't it?

611
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,185
Had come looking forthat uncle

612
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:58,027
Hey Pauleena, where are you?

613
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:01,356

614
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,800

Hello, what a sleep is this?

You were searching no? He has
roamed and returned back here

618

01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,297
Brother, will this block end now?

lf there is a block in the
heart, can consult a doctor

621
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,566
There is no medicine for this
lf you are that much busy

622

Go straight through this way

623

01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,990
On hearing that..
That..Fellow just laughed

683
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,029
He is a boy who
grew up without mother

684
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:28,397
That is what all this
childishness is about

685
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:32,664
Then till 15 years he
traveled a lot along with me

686
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,636
For his meal he gets from that

687
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,073
Between us there is no
father, son relation okay

688
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,682
A space between two
friends, that is always there

689
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:46,649
A father who is lunatic who grew him
up, doesn't he become a lunatic?

690
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,021
We just going to roam
around are you coming?

691
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,890
Will it be him?

692
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,662
Come!

693
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,069
Hello!
My son, father!

694
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:13,813
Father is your pop!

695
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,044
Look, have you stopped booze?
Why not? Since a week

696
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:20,548
See the sea as a
lover and be happy

697
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,884
Hey fellow, look that girl
has come here - Which girl?

698
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,323
Hey fellow, other day l have told
no? That girl has come here

699
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:29,497
My Pop, tell that girl not yet time for
the 'Genie' to appear before her

700
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,962
Tell herto wait

701
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,857
Fellow that is not the thing
That is the only thing

702
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:34,332
Okay, the vehicle will leave now

703
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,368
Look, its him, its him

704
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,633
Shucks!

705
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,513
There is some plan inside him

706
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:57,351
Then will he have to play
a 'cat and mouse game?'

707
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,419
He will come

708
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:46,166
''Lightening which gave
wings to a black cloud''

709
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:54,982

''Who is he? What is he,
is he some sort of illusion?''

714
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:20,637

gave him the wings''

719
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:14,188

Hey fellow, you..!

Aren't you the person?

734
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,881
Hey fellow, aren't you that thief?.

735
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:21,053
Hey fellow!

736
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:27,819
This is me, no?

01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:32,722
Look, here is my sir very
good has drawn very well

738
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:34,233
Do you know where this
sir is at present?

739
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:38,668
Sister, true upon this noodles have
seen on that day, then l haven't seen

740
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,375
Sister have you drawn this?
You are really talented

741
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,377
Did you see this?
Yeah, l saw that

742
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,215
The story ends here, the
balance is not detailed in this

743
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,112
No, is it? Where else it
will go? l'll find it now itself

744
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,752
lt'll be here only

745
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,284
Hey fellow, that is not here

746
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,382
No, is it?
What is the balance that happened?

747
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:03,128
l was the one who climbed first

748
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,697
Sir, was just behind me

749
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,447
What is it?

750
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:26,816
Sir, we'll leave

751
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,817
Wait, wait, don't close it

752
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,685
No sir, we'll leave sir

753
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,451
This won't be good at all
Don't close it - Sir, we'll leave

754
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:35,923
This isn't good at all

755
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:45,733
Sir, sir! Sir, don't go
Sir, no need

756
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,450
Leave!

757
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,546
Sir, no need sir

758
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,260
Stop the vehicle

759
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:48,367
Brother, a small help follow that bike

760
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:00,074
Sister was it you, who
was planning to die?

761
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:04,211
No is it?

762
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,845
Since it was night l
couldn't see the face properly

763
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,323
This is nice okay
Where is that house?

764
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,826
Why don't we go to that place?
Today?

765
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,055
Tonight its not possible, tonight l
have to visit a Gulf person's home

766
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,393
We'll go tomorrow, l'll come and pick

767
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,067
Not at night, right now

768
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,396
You mean day time? Sister during
the day time l'll confused with route

769
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:31,205
ls it this one?
Orthat one?

770
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,417
Sister, this is the one, sure
This is the one

771
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:41,286
Not that one, this is the one

772
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,357
Sister!
Who are you to sir?

773
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:56,400
You both are really cool!

774
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,312
Hello?
Tessa, where are you?

775
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:15,448
Hello, hello, Tessa can't
you hear what l asked?

776
01:18:33,342 --> 01:18:35,435
For the last two days
l have been calling you

777
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:37,611
Why are you not
picking up the phone?

778
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,976
Shahina, why don't we wind up?
Take the wide of that and close

779
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,643
Why did you go to Kani's house?

780
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:49,554
lts not a spy work, lot of media
people had visited that home

781
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,488
That is because..To get
the balance of that story

782
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,927
One story and a person
who is never met at all

783
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,066
What is there in it?
To excite you

784
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,569
On that there are only
things which excite me

785
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:11,146
''Beautiful girl..''

786
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:15,479
''Beautiful girl..''

787
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:23,951
''Hey girl, did you see?''

788
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,287
''Searching for a person''

789
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:36,037
''Beautiful girl..''

790
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:43,970
''Beautiful girl..''

791
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,418
Stop the vehicle
''The heart is withering''

792
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:54,077
''Setting fire on the nerves''

793
01:19:55,290 --> 01:20:01,490
''Without winking the eyes,
who is this girl searching for?''

794
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:05,597
''Beautiful girl..''

795
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:13,567
''Beautiful girl..''

796
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:28,984
Kani chechi (sister) one person
has come to meet you, honestly

797
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:34,086
We quit, one person
has come to meet you

798
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:49,305
You may go and play, okay
Come on girl

799
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:51,002
We'll go there and play

800
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,278
l couldn't recognise you
l had gone home

801
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,118
Are you from the media?

802
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:03,189
An incident had happened without
the knowledge of media people, no?

803
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,690
ln Kani's life?

804
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:13,226
On the previous new year day

805
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:20,040
ln this story it is not mentioned
what happened next on that night

806
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:25,773
Kani, that Zaban and 3
other people had scolded Usman

807
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:27,638
Regarding the Thanya's matter

808
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:32,115
To call and say all this matter to
him, he is in search of some Ruby

809
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,345
He comes and leaves as
he wishes, let him come here

810
01:21:34,523 --> 01:21:36,787
Anyway don't leave
Thanya to play outside

811
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:40,053
Who is this one?
Okay yeah recognised

812
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:42,163
Friend is it?
l knew it

813
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:45,731
l'm Kunjappan, so for
two days won't you be here?

814
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:48,594
Should be here, that is the rule here

815
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:52,204
Playing and all is good, but
kids don't go outside, okay

816
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:56,174
We won't go
Good, kids should be like that

817
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:00,141
ln search of this balance of
this story, coming this far?

818
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:03,341
Not the story, l came in search
of the person who wrote this story

819
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,623
What is this? Today also its
the same wheat gruel

820
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:16,363
Today its the wheat gruel,
tomorrow its the milk gruel

821
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:19,363
Today also same old wheat gruel
How is wheat gruel?

822
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:24,368
Since abandoned by children
that is why staying here, is it?

823
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:27,201
Then what is wrong if you
could prepare some tasty food?

824
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:31,175
My Sudhakara, tomorrow you'll
be fed with beef, is that okay?

825
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,346
Then what?

826
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,505
On seeing one plate of beef,
his heart will stop working

827
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:39,580
By the way, daughter do you cook?

828
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:42,782
Nope - What a pity? When
will you learn all this?

829
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:45,519
Should prepare some good
food and serve to groom -

830
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:47,388
- only then the things
will become strong

831
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,256
That is the psychology of that matter

832
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,763
l'm not married
Really?

833
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,832
Same pitch, l'm also not married

834
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:58,330
While saying not married, you must
have selected the groom, is it?

835
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:00,404
Where is he? ls he in army?
Kunjappo!

836
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:04,943
While serving us with wheat gruel,
you are having soup overthere, no?

837
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,372
Go man, go!

838
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:10,574
This is my own child - lf he
had married at the right time

839
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:12,753
He could have got an own
child like this, haven't he?

840
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:15,388
For that l was in army, wasn't l?
Didn't get the time to marry

841
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,684
Then what? Were you
'firing' daily over there?

842
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:19,827
Just don't con man
Go man

843
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:24,588
Daughter, this Kunjappan chettan
(brother) was in love with a Mariamma

844
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:27,597
Stupid! lf you change the
name and say l'll shoot you

845
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:31,296
lts not Mariamma, it is Thresia
Chakupurakal Thresia

846
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,768
Okay if it is Thresia, fine
with Thresia

847
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:38,613
Look, my house was
near the river shore

848
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,441
So, the Thresia's house
was on the other shore

849
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,542
Okay carry on, come on tell

850
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:48,915
On a rainy day Kunjappan
chettan was drenched in love!

851
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:52,650
Hey fellow Chakko, while telling to
say a thing, is it how you tell that?

852
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:58,989
Child, the thing is
this rain is love, isn't it?

853
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,900
And the rain is love isn't it?

854
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,633
This rained in cats and dogs!

855
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,431
Now, someone may tell the rest

856
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:13,342
Now, what is there to say? Afterthe
rain when he swimmed to other shore

857
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:16,607
There is no trace of Thresia at all!

858
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:19,350
lt was completely drenched in water

859
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:25,289
lt was a severe rain which was
not in accordance with the time

860
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:28,621
Thinking that when it gets over
will go and reveal the love

861
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,664
On reaching the other shore,
Thresia's home was washed off by water

862
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,368
They left the native by picking
up the rags which was left behind

863
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,867
No one knew to
where they had gone

864
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:40,298
At that time, l was
only aged 16 or 1 7

865
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:43,838
l searched a lot, then came
the commitments of life

866
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:47,481
Had joined the army, it
went on and on like that!

867
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,047
Reached so far

868
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:54,354
To say 'l love you to Thresia'
still now remaining unmarried

869
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:56,581
Yeah, fellow l'll remain
unmarried, l'll remain!

870
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,521
lf there is yet another birth, at
that time also l'll stand like that

871
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,320
That is the kick of love!

872
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,660
Haven't you seen so far? -While
coming for each and every leave

873
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,696
Will search here and there
Where to get?

874
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,698
Then l'll return

875
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:11,437
Hey fellow, love is a opium
which entices humans

876
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,573
That is what is told
by one and only Karl Marx

877
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,868
No one over here
will understand all that

878
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,011
But you have understood it, isn't it?

879
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:22,540
See, there is a pain in waiting

880
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:26,384
That is a pleasure
lsn't it?

881
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,722
My goodness!
Come have the gruel

882
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,895
Hello
Hello

883
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,756
Yeah, l can hear
Come on tell

884
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:38,523
Girl, l can't hear what you are saying

885
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:39,734
Right from morning l was calling

886
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,629
Your mother and Georji
had come to meet me

887
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,064
And then?
Hello

888
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,633
Hello, they had asked
me where you are

889
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,041
Hello
Hello

890
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,409
Over here the range
of the phone is less

891
01:25:57,352 --> 01:26:01,550
Tessa, tomorrow morning
we have to go to a place

892
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,698
l'll come now

893
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:33,477
Let me check
There is no problem at all

894
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,983
Hey fellow don't play on
the bike go, l say

895
01:26:41,463 --> 01:26:43,124
How long have you
started to ride the bike?

896
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:45,728
Used to go to college on this

897
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:47,629
This was Pappaji's vehicle

898
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,504
On that night, where did
you go with the bike?

899
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,473
Kunjappan chettan used to say,
he enters into each person's life

900
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:03,912
Unexpectedly

901
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,881
Stop the vehicle
Hello

902
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,185
Stop, stop the vehicle
Stop

903
01:27:16,498 --> 01:27:18,466
Hey stop the vehicle

904
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:20,165
Stop the vehicle

905
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:24,762
What a speeding is this?

906
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,431
Since he mocked at you, do
you want to speed up like this?

907
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:31,545
Had a booze that is why,
anyway brothers you may go

908
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:39,986
Look, l came to say a sorry

909
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:42,519
l know it is not right to stop a person
from dying without his permission -

910
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:43,214
- to stop from dying

911
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,684
Because of that, l'm sorry

912
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:46,853
Now you may go

913
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:57,932
When you kick with love,
only then it will get started

914
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:08,181
Look this hanging and jumping in
the sea, that is all old fashioned

915
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,243
Why don't we try something new?

916
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,887
Pal, what a kick it was?

917
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,084
The kidney went up to the brain
now should massage it down!

918
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:26,831
Look

919
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:29,064
Have you heard one who was -

920
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:30,465
- struck by thunder
bolt was bitten by snake?

921
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,265
Most probably that's
going to happen now

922
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,466
Why don't we slowly
push off in 'reverse gear?'

923
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:38,209
l don't know to fight with these five
men and walk in slow motion

924
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:40,774
Come, don't stand here
Come

925
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:52,557
Look we went wrong with the route
how to go to Kanjiramattom?

926
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:55,020
That you go straight and turn left

927
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:56,595
Okay then
Okay

928
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:00,527
Great
Are you going?

929
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:03,062
Don't leave a matured
male alone and go like that

930
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,774
Go straight from here
and drop me at the other side

931
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:12,511
Foot rest?
lt is very near

932
01:29:13,982 --> 01:29:15,313
lts only about 150 kilometres!

933
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,276
Vattavada!

934
01:29:23,258 --> 01:29:24,987
Okay then

935
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:43,968
My god!

936
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,049
Have you seen the hunter?.

937
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:53,684
The Orion

938
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:58,158
Anyway you are going to
die, aren't you? Just watch that

939
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:00,187
lt is nice

940
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,259
Come on simply watch

941
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:25,216
Have you seen
snow falling on the hills?

942
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,355
Have you seen magic mushroom?

943
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:32,587
Without seeing any of these what to
do when you urgently go there?

944
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:36,652
On reaching there, he'll ask have
you come here, seeing all that?

945
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:40,230
'HE' has made all
this for us to watch

946
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:43,301
Simply see all that and
you may go happily

947
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:49,374
l don't know who you are, what
you are and what is your past

948
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,371
Why you tried to
suicide, l don't know all that

949
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,343
Go man, go

950
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:57,675
Look, new year is over no?
Don't just roam around, go home

951
01:30:58,219 --> 01:30:59,846
Then shall we push off?.

Come on pop in

954
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,627
A person who has decided to die
are you scared to come with me?

955
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:10,886
Come!

956
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:13,791

960
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:33,715
Get on it!

961
01:31:34,389 --> 01:31:35,356
Come

01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:58,036
''Like a new drizzle, fluttering the
wings nearthe window, comes hooting''

963
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:00,872
''A mellowing cool breeze''

964
01:32:01,749 --> 01:32:09,884
''Memories comes wetting the
eyes, the ray of day light comes''

965
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:14,788
''Today, there is some
unknown fragrance''

966
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:19,296
''Comes to my door and
will it extend its hands?''

967
01:32:19,734 --> 01:32:27,971
''So far you have been a
flower nearthe dream''

968
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:36,207
''Hey flower, can you remain
blossomed beside me?''

969
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:43,485
''Like a new drizzle, fluttering the
wings nearthe window, comes hooting''

970
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:46,383
''A mellowing cool breeze''

971
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:55,495
''Memories comes wetting the
eyes, the ray of day light comes''

972
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:27,524
''Like an unfading butterfly,
you fluttered the wings''

973
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:32,100
''Have you come on the tender
leaves to render magical spell?''

974
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:36,835
''You spread honey
all across the sky''

975
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:41,071
''You come like a flowery
breeze over here''

976
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:51,421
''So far you have been a
flower nearthe dream''

977
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:57,992
''Hey flower, can you remain
blossomed beside me?''

978
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:06,068
''Like a new drizzle, fluttering the
wings nearthe window, comes hooting''

979
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:09,242
''A mellowing cool breeze''

980
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:13,607
''Today, there is some
unknown fragrance''

981
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:18,282
''Comes to my door and
will it extend its hands?''

982
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:24,890
''On these paths, a flower
beside the dream''

983
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:27,617
''Hey flower''

984
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:34,333
''Hey flower, can you remain
blossomed beside me?''

985
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,903
''Hey flower''

986
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,546
Kannan chetta - Yes madam
Two tea

987
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:49,644
Will give now

988
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:52,245
Child Rosy, how is the health?

989
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,919
Good
Bye

990
01:34:57,992 --> 01:35:00,119
Over here no one has
asked about my past

991
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:02,623
l had a relationship

992
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:05,188
That person has been
studying with me

993
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:09,562
One day he came and told he has
got FRCS and wants to go to London

994
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:14,030
Told to end this relationship

995
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:18,000
We shouldn't dishearten
a person who is careerist

996
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,242
By saying all the best and
all, had send him happily

997
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:24,179
But l was totally depressed

998
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:28,581
On that day, it was an independent
operation doing for first time in my life

999
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,115
The mind got swayed

1000
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:35,589
A child who was only
10 years old, with my hands..!

1001
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:40,530
That was a big news
on TV and newspaper

1002
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:43,667
During that time,
l was 2 months pregnant

1003
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:46,006
ln that depression, that one also..!

1004
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:56,345
No matter how much we plan,
the fate of life is beyond that

1005
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:02,649
On that day, that person
returned to me not only a new life

1006
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:08,318
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''

1007
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:13,032
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''

1008
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:17,930
''On visiting there, will serve
with coffee, black coffee''

1009
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,672
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''

1010
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:26,569
So are you going
by packing everything?

1011
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,180
So, has Kunjappan started
to set terms?

1012
01:36:28,382 --> 01:36:30,748
Comes and goes as he pleases,
that is your kind of terms, no?

1013
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:32,985
Don't make me talk more

1014
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:38,055
Tighten it well, otherwise all the
nibbles will be spilled inside the bag

1015
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:50,433
Madam coffee
lts a coffee made ofjaggery, have it

1016
01:36:51,072 --> 01:36:53,404
You'll be fine
How is the sleep and all?

1017
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:57,205
Aren't you happy? lt is some
dried fish and smashed meat

1018
01:36:57,445 --> 01:36:59,538
l have got some
8 years old girl friends

1019
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,042
lts forthem

1020
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:03,716
Then l'm taking leave, will just
roam around 'Kambam and Theni'

1021
01:37:04,085 --> 01:37:05,484
Will straight away head
to 'Ambasamudram'

1022
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:07,654
By the way, what is doctor's plan?

1023
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,019
When you wish to leave, put the
vehicle in neutral and descend the hill

1024
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:19,655
My goodness, are you leaving?
Can't you stay for one or two days?

1025
01:37:20,468 --> 01:37:23,062
Then what? Find some other person
to eat Tapioca in a high range

1026
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:24,532
With some old guys

1027
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:27,273
Buddy, l'm different buddy
Good, if you want to go-

1028
01:37:27,475 --> 01:37:29,705
- again if you come here
saying wants to eat Tapioca

1029
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:31,738
Look, man Kunjappa, don't mess up!

1030
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:34,480
l'll find that Thresia and
marry you off

1031
01:37:34,815 --> 01:37:38,148
Her husband and kids and
grandchildren will come climbing the hill

1032
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:39,785
Then there won't be
Kunjappan to put the wreath

1033
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:41,110
That is your..!

1034
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:43,683
Go man!

1035
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:48,295
That is bad words, since doctor is
standing here he is muting it and saying

1036
01:37:48,496 --> 01:37:51,124
He is playing with me
Okay then

1037
01:37:55,836 --> 01:37:57,463
One minute

1038
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,610
From here to the nearest government
hospital, it'll take minimum 3 hours

1039
01:38:04,812 --> 01:38:07,406
lf you can, doctor stay
here forfew days

1040
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:09,479
Try to experience this space

1041
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:14,312
Sometimes this trick called life,
may get some new dimensions

1042
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:18,820
Come on don't stand
like this, take a deep breath

1043
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:20,319
Look, like this

1044
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:27,633
Come on take it, you don't
have to invest money for that

1045
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:29,335
Simply take it

1046
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:11,104
After going on that
day when did he return?

1047
01:39:11,912 --> 01:39:14,574
One night he had come and
dropped Thanya and left

1048
01:39:14,748 --> 01:39:16,375
Then one ortwo phone calls

1049
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:19,852
But over here, everyone
misses him a lot

1050
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:28,760
Tessa came all this way to here, on
searching him, who is not met once

1051
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:45,711
What is seen is here is only there
l'm a bachelor

1052
01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:51,146
Then one of my naughty friend is
there we both had set up this place

1053
01:39:51,418 --> 01:39:53,682
A shelterfor those
people who has got no one

1054
01:39:57,324 --> 01:40:00,316
Will go?
Why are you going all of a sudden?

1055
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:03,159
lts a climate better
than Ooty, just tell all that

1056
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:05,958
Can leave after two days
Must go!

1057
01:40:06,367 --> 01:40:08,232
There is a function at
home next week

1058
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:10,335
Mummy you may go
down, we'll come now

1059
01:40:14,308 --> 01:40:18,176
This place is his, isn't it?
As per your character -

1060
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:20,279
- it is not surprising that
you came searching for him

1061
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:26,613
On coming 27th it is my wedding

1062
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:32,451
Perhaps in our family you
are the last one to know this

1063
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:37,495
Hey girl, is it a big fault that l wish
for my wedding you should be present?

1064
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,903
Yeah, Paulosachaya, what is said?

1065
01:40:47,675 --> 01:40:50,610
lf there is any discomfort
we'll shift to another hospital

1066
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:56,347
Grandma is hospitalised
What happened?

1067
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:58,780
On the previous day there was a
quarrel between Mummy and grandma

1068
01:40:58,986 --> 01:40:59,975
Regarding yourtopic

1069
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:02,480
That resulted in a
small variation on the BP

1070
01:41:03,324 --> 01:41:04,791
Who is there at the hospital?

1071
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,527
Hello Mummy
Haven't you started?

1072
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:09,423

Yeah, doctor has done this, no?

1075
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:25,671
All these are new implementations

1076
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,979
Today is Kunjappan chettan's
birthday, he is 70 years now

1077
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:31,012
So what?

1078
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:35,514
The age will come and go why do
you want to inform that to others?

1079
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,449
Now where will l
go and search him?

1080
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:51,088

01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:27,091
l'll make them run, everyone

1096
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,195
You are telling you'll make
them run and you are running now

1097
01:44:29,897 --> 01:44:31,694
Hey angel who resides
on the hill top

1098
01:44:32,065 --> 01:44:33,589
Are you fine?

1099
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:37,596
This is Kani, it is
not restricted 'Kani' (fruit)

1100
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:40,068
lt is an original 'Kani'. Can

1101
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:42,697
Please come

1102
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:45,811
Going to pray by placing the hand
on all 'Satan's' head, over here

1103
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:48,676
All these years had lived without
any church or clergy people

1104
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:52,578
My dear Kujapoo, speak low, they
will hear - Telling, so that they can hear

1105
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:55,980
He comes in, once in a while and
he thinks he can do any nonsense

1106
01:44:57,024 --> 01:45:00,016
Why has he come with everyone?
ls it to do the 'last rituals' for me?

1107
01:45:00,227 --> 01:45:02,821
My Kunjapa, they have
come to pray - To pray..!

1108
01:45:03,597 --> 01:45:05,531
l haven't delegated
anyone, to pray for me

1109
01:45:05,899 --> 01:45:07,526
Then why is he..?

1110
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:15,740
''Hey Saviour, You are the kindness''

1111
01:45:15,943 --> 01:45:25,750
''Pardon the sins,
You are the divine grace''

1112
01:45:25,953 --> 01:45:35,089
''On the deserted desert, you
became the water of life''

1113
01:45:35,262 --> 01:45:44,534
''These people who are thirsty
always be with them''

1114
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,030
Mr. Kunjapps!

1115
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:50,603
Are you sitting here?

1116
01:45:54,548 --> 01:45:57,745
Kunjappa!
Kunjappa!

1117
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:02,050
When a person comes to meet,
are you sitting with face turned away?

1118
01:46:03,156 --> 01:46:05,590
This is sister Theraiz Mary

1119
01:46:08,996 --> 01:46:10,793
Forthe last 30 years
settled at Seashells

1120
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:13,794
The house was at Kavalam

1121
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:19,161
The name called at home is Thresia

1122
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:22,108
Chakuparakal Thresia

1123
01:46:45,299 --> 01:46:49,702
Maruthu, is the tea ready to serve
them? What is there for nibble?

1124
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:52,133
Good Tapioca is there
That's great

1125
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:01,108
Chakocha, come
What is it son?

1126
01:47:01,315 --> 01:47:03,249
Come, come fast

1127
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:06,009
Come
What is it? -Come fast

1128
01:47:09,289 --> 01:47:11,280
Tell the matter
Come, come

1129
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:14,693
Do you know who is standing there?

1130
01:47:14,895 --> 01:47:16,123
Which one?
Who is it?

1131
01:47:17,297 --> 01:47:20,698
That old love of Kunjappan is there
no? That was washed off in the flood

1132
01:47:20,901 --> 01:47:22,300
That is the one
My goodness!

1133
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:24,694
The one and only
Chakupurakal Thresia

1134
01:47:26,139 --> 01:47:28,630
Chakupurakal Thresia!

1135
01:47:29,076 --> 01:47:30,703
My heavens!

1136
01:47:40,987 --> 01:47:43,956
My Christ how difficult was it
to bring the sisters to this place?

1137
01:47:44,257 --> 01:47:47,021
These sisters come for
two weeks visit after 5 or 6 years

1138
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,319
When the main father told,
can't take them like that

1139
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:51,322
l just fell on those feet

1140
01:47:51,932 --> 01:47:55,800
Take that Tapioca, while traveling
through Kudamaloor, Kurishumala

1141
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:59,064
On deviating there is a place
where lot of old people live

1142
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:02,833
Just come and pray for them, l
begged and told in the lying posture

1143
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:05,676
Otherwise, can l
say among these sisters?

1144
01:48:05,812 --> 01:48:08,212
Can l say there is an old Thresia
present who is loved by our Kujappan?

1145
01:48:10,117 --> 01:48:12,745
lmmediately if they hearthat won't
they hook me on the cross?

1146
01:48:14,054 --> 01:48:15,851
Sister Gulothi, you
have got diabetics

1147
01:48:16,056 --> 01:48:17,387
l hail from Manimala

1148
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:20,824
On eating Tapioca, if it is to die
means let the death take place

1149
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:22,256
Sister, if death comes, take it cool

1150
01:48:22,462 --> 01:48:25,260
Along with cross in the cemetery,
l'll place a few Tapioca also

1151
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:26,796
Then what?

1152
01:48:32,005 --> 01:48:41,107
''On the 'Golgotha hills'
on the unending paths''

1153
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:50,915
''With the foot steps engulfed
in grief, climbs the hill''

1154
01:48:51,057 --> 01:48:59,795
''Someone walks on the waves''

1155
01:49:00,434 --> 01:49:10,275
''Won't you render the
blessing, divine one?''

1156
01:49:10,477 --> 01:49:14,345
''You are the love''
But how did you manage to get her?

1157
01:49:14,514 --> 01:49:17,847
For few days l was after this,
anyway it was great, wasn't it? -Yeah

1158
01:49:18,018 --> 01:49:20,282
lf anyone is waiting for
someone, come on just tell

1159
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:23,151
Kunjappa!
You naughty lover!

1160
01:49:24,257 --> 01:49:28,489
Closed the door and are you sitting
shyly? Come out, Kunjapoo!

1161
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:32,831
Kunjapa, come out

1162
01:49:33,099 --> 01:49:34,999
Kunjap..!

1163
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:43,367
Can l sit alone for some time?

1164
01:49:58,091 --> 01:49:59,786
Sir, you just tell what you want

1165
01:49:59,993 --> 01:50:01,858
Shall l built a 'tree house'
on that big tree?

1166
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:05,198
Sir, just tell what to do

1167
01:50:06,299 --> 01:50:07,960
All that can be done after l come

1168
01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:10,530
Sir, when you go
when will you come back?

1169
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:13,335
That is..Come on
Maruthu, have coffee

1170
01:50:13,573 --> 01:50:16,770
Kunjappan chettan, has not opened
the door so far, will it be a problem?

1171
01:50:17,377 --> 01:50:21,404
No problem at all, he'll be completely
in a romantic mood, over there

1172
01:50:21,848 --> 01:50:25,011
Let him sit there and
let him simply enjoy it

1173
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:26,479
Maruthu, hold this one

1174
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:30,878
What if, if the life ended without
seeing the person who is waited?

1175
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:33,218
For that only, people like
us are living on this earth

1176
01:50:33,426 --> 01:50:36,156
So, if we wait for a person sincerely -

1177
01:50:36,496 --> 01:50:38,396
- some day that person
will come, won't he?

1178
01:50:38,598 --> 01:50:41,362
Then what?
Where else to go

1179
01:50:42,269 --> 01:50:44,237
Then why are you hiding like this?

1180
01:50:46,573 --> 01:50:50,475
People who hide away from one's
own matters, they chatter like this

1181
01:50:50,844 --> 01:50:53,904
By the way doctor, what is this? As
if prescription of some English medicine

1182
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:56,105
Can't make out anything
Are you scared?

1183
01:50:57,317 --> 01:50:59,410
Why not? There is a fear whether
cow may come and poke!

1184
01:50:59,619 --> 01:51:00,950
There is a fear whether
coconut may fall on the head

1185
01:51:01,121 --> 01:51:02,588
Are you scared to love?

1186
01:51:06,593 --> 01:51:10,029
When a person says loves
you, how will you react to it?

1187
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,894
Where to say?
Who is there to say?

1188
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:18,270
Suppose if a person says like that

1189
01:51:20,073 --> 01:51:23,304
That is like..
Hey doctor

1190
01:51:24,411 --> 01:51:27,972
When we crash into others life
and when we give some surprises

1191
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:30,206
That, glow in their
eyes is there, isn't it?

1192
01:51:31,017 --> 01:51:33,485
l just continue to live
on that fun and thrill

1193
01:51:34,487 --> 01:51:38,446
lf some one expects more from
me, that may end up in a problem

1194
01:51:39,326 --> 01:51:42,625
But it doesn't mean that l may end
up doctor in a problem, l'm sure

1195
01:51:44,431 --> 01:51:46,922
Forgot to give the medicine
to Kunjappan chettan - Kani!

1196
01:51:48,435 --> 01:51:50,596
You didn't say the matter
which you were about to say

1197
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:55,435
Do you know Tessa?

1198
01:51:58,178 --> 01:52:00,305
Had come here
When?

1199
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:02,141
Was here for two days

1200
01:52:02,449 --> 01:52:05,509
Didn't know you will come
today, left today morning only

1201
01:52:07,053 --> 01:52:08,645
Why is this, cat and mouse play?

1202
01:52:09,322 --> 01:52:11,586
Why do you want to
fool that girl, like this?

1203
01:52:12,559 --> 01:52:16,120
No
l'm not fooling anyone

1204
01:52:18,164 --> 01:52:20,098
Don't take that in a
simple manner like this

1205
01:52:22,435 --> 01:52:25,666
l know
Yeah, l know Tessa

1206
01:52:27,374 --> 01:52:31,071
Everything, searching for
me, staying in that room

1207
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:35,009
From the stories that
is heard about me

1208
01:52:35,215 --> 01:52:37,376
l don't know what is the
image she has got about me

1209
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:40,212
lf it were a negative image, that
girl won't come to this place -

1210
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,352
- searching for you

1211
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:44,183
My mother, l'm not there
to argue with doctor

1212
01:52:46,059 --> 01:52:48,084
My life is not disciplined and
systematically arranged

1213
01:52:48,361 --> 01:52:50,522
There is no plan in
particular, simply like this..

1214
01:52:54,234 --> 01:52:56,202
Still there is a possibility for all that

1215
01:52:56,403 --> 01:52:57,927
During the time of
fever, l have thought

1216
01:52:58,071 --> 01:53:00,096
lf l had a girl as a company

1217
01:53:01,007 --> 01:53:02,998
Can inflict the fever
to one more person

1218
01:53:04,544 --> 01:53:06,512
l'm not saying for an argument

1219
01:53:06,713 --> 01:53:09,204
The only concern is,
what you have shown on me

1220
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:11,009
That is what l have towards Tessa

1221
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:15,979
Go and sing that song
to your stupid father, fellows

1222
01:53:16,256 --> 01:53:17,689
Go
Kunjappo!

1223
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:23,057
l should have send some coffee
powder and tea leaf to them

1224
01:53:23,263 --> 01:53:24,161
To whom?

1225
01:53:26,433 --> 01:53:29,561
They are going back tomorrow, no?

1226
01:53:31,504 --> 01:53:37,272
Shucks! On seeing, l was
perplexed, l couldn't say anything

1227
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:40,238
Whatever she told,
l didn't hearthat also

1228
01:53:43,383 --> 01:53:44,247
By the way son -

1229
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:48,418
- perhaps if my Thresia had known
such a person is searching for her

1230
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:50,179
Maybe if some one had told that

1231
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:52,153
We might have met long back

1232
01:53:52,392 --> 01:53:53,416
lsn't it?

1233
01:53:56,796 --> 01:53:58,024
lsn't it?

1234
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,767
lsn't it?

1235
01:54:34,567 --> 01:54:35,625
Going!

1236
01:54:36,069 --> 01:54:38,503
When l say bye, then there
will be cries and sentiments

1237
01:54:38,738 --> 01:54:40,171
That will be a big messy

1238
01:54:44,177 --> 01:54:47,078
lf you don't mind, can
you drop me till that bus stop?

1239
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,074
Tomorrow it is our 'Thrissur
Pooram' (Temple festival)

1240
01:54:52,318 --> 01:54:53,808
Doctor, have you participated
in any of the 'Poorams?'

1241
01:54:54,187 --> 01:54:57,281
No
Should just see it what a beauty

1242
01:54:57,457 --> 01:55:00,119
This time there is no 'Pampadi
Rajan' other guy will be there

1243
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:04,662
'Adiyattu Ayyappa' when stationed
in dark, can't see, so dark in colour

1244
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:06,490
From there will
head to 'Kunnamkulam'

1245
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:08,223
Should take the bullet
of lttikora Pappan

1246
01:55:08,434 --> 01:55:11,460
With that bike, heads to 'Katmandu'
through 'Goa, Gokarnam'

1247
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:15,674
Some of my friends homes
are lost, should help them also

1248
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:17,542
From there will travel to North East

1249
01:55:18,545 --> 01:55:23,175
Forjust 3 months - so, not
planning to meet that girl, no?

1250
01:55:24,217 --> 01:55:28,278
Here comes again! l thought after
a sleep you'll forget everything

1251
01:55:28,888 --> 01:55:32,085
For you everything is a
child's play, no? Orjust a fun

1252
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:35,554
Never at all

1253
01:55:36,396 --> 01:55:40,890
Doctor my father has demanded
only one thing during all these years

1254
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:44,464
That was to meet that girl - Then
why can't you fulfil father's wish?

1255
01:55:49,542 --> 01:55:52,739
Not that, how can l
simply meet that girl?

1256
01:55:53,646 --> 01:55:55,443
While seeing a girl, who has
searched me so long

1257
01:55:55,648 --> 01:55:57,115
There should be some variety, no?

1258
01:55:57,383 --> 01:55:59,510
Only while meeting
like that, it will turn colourful

1259
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:05,288
There is a person!
Okay right!

1260
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:11,191
Take care of our Kunjappan, my
fear is will he join any Seminary?

1261
01:56:11,331 --> 01:56:12,127
At this age

1262
01:56:15,435 --> 01:56:18,734
Look, let me tell one matter
which is serious, not playful

1263
01:56:20,206 --> 01:56:22,504
Tell Tessa, to come if she has not
seen 'Pooram' (Temple festival)

1264
01:56:22,742 --> 01:56:24,767
l'll be there in the mist of crowd

1265
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:27,913
Let her find me, if she can

1266
01:56:53,339 --> 01:56:57,605
l know, it is not an easy
task to find a person from there

1267
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:02,571
But there is no other way

1268
01:57:05,451 --> 01:57:08,852
''Beautiful girl..''

1269
01:57:11,824 --> 01:57:15,624
''Beautiful girl..''

1270
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:23,724
''Hey girl, did you see?''

1271
01:57:27,373 --> 01:57:30,536
''Searching for a person''

1272
01:57:34,013 --> 01:57:36,311
''The heart is withering''

1273
01:57:36,549 --> 01:57:40,315
''Setting fire on the nerves''

1274
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:47,486
''Without winking the eyes,
who is this girl searching for?''

1275
01:57:47,694 --> 01:57:51,562
''Beautiful girl..''

1276
01:57:56,936 --> 01:58:00,463
By risking the own life,
by knotting the hands and legs

1277
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:03,473
lnside this box
Pay attention

1278
01:58:06,012 --> 01:58:12,349
From this box, a person who
has knotted his hands and legs

1279
01:58:12,552 --> 01:58:15,715
Within seconds he'll come out

1280
01:58:21,394 --> 01:58:23,487
This is my last item

1281
01:59:22,388 --> 01:59:23,753
Come fast

1282
02:00:53,546 --> 02:00:54,877
Wasn't it colourful?

1283
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,406
Coming forfirst time to 'Pooram', no?

1284
02:00:58,951 --> 02:01:02,011
Hey Thiru, ready, come
packing everything

1285
02:01:02,221 --> 02:01:04,712
He is my tutor
The great magician

1286
02:01:05,892 --> 02:01:09,589
Not seen her before
l'm also seeing forfirst time

1287
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:11,063
This is Tessa

1288
02:01:11,964 --> 02:01:14,831
Daughter, your
government stopped arrack

1289
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:16,195
Stopped the bar

1290
02:01:16,569 --> 02:01:18,230
Do you have anything with you?

1291
02:01:19,238 --> 02:01:22,571
Okay, l'll pack everything and come
Okay go and come

1292
02:01:28,881 --> 02:01:31,611
Why don't we have
a hot, cold lime juice?

1293
02:01:59,645 --> 02:02:01,772
l'm Sruthi
Sruthi Raman

1294
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:09,281
Where you expecting anyone else?

1295
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,969
When will the festival begin?

1296
02:02:26,606 --> 02:02:28,938
What?
When will the festival begin?

1297
02:02:30,209 --> 02:02:31,574
Will start now

1298
02:02:33,713 --> 02:02:35,647
Where is Tessa's house?
That you said

1299
02:02:37,049 --> 02:02:39,813
l don't know where your Tessa's
house is, my house is at Pondi

1300
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:41,577
Pondicherry

1301
02:02:49,295 --> 02:02:50,956
Who is this Tessa?

1302
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:53,165
Did she dump you?
And ran?

1303
02:02:55,568 --> 02:02:57,297
That is a 'Genie' which is not seen

1304
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:02,103
With an image which was in my
mind, just made a blind attempt

1305
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:04,673
l thought you are that girl

1306
02:03:08,147 --> 02:03:11,639
When l ask you a serious
question, would you lie?

1307
02:03:16,622 --> 02:03:17,816
Actually, you are the Tessa, no?

1308
02:03:27,366 --> 02:03:29,800
Come fast, the festival
is about to begin

1309
02:03:30,002 --> 02:03:30,991
Yeah, coming

1310
02:03:35,341 --> 02:03:37,002
Now what is the next plan?

1311
02:03:43,616 --> 02:03:44,776
Alone?

1312
02:03:57,029 --> 02:03:58,621
Will we meet again?

1313
02:04:00,066 --> 02:04:01,693
lf at all seen, will we remember?

1314
02:04:02,802 --> 02:04:04,030
Who knows

1315
02:04:06,005 --> 02:04:08,701
So, why don't we
take a great photo?

1316
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:10,089
Sruthi!
The festival!

1317
02:06:13,032 --> 02:06:13,999
Tessa!

1318
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:29,545
Charlie!

1319
02:07:40,986 --> 02:07:45,616
''Beautiful girl..''

1320
02:07:48,127 --> 02:07:51,062
''Beautiful girl..''

1321
02:07:56,035 --> 02:07:59,368
''Hey girl, did you see?''

1322
02:08:03,142 --> 02:08:06,305
''Searching for a person''

1323
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:12,910
''Beautiful girl..''

1324
02:08:16,188 --> 02:08:19,885
''Beautiful girl..''

1325
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:26,122
''The heart is withering''

1326
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:30,131
''Setting fire on the nerves''

1327
02:08:31,003 --> 02:08:37,135
''Without winking the eyes,
who is this girl searching for?''

1328
02:08:37,343 --> 02:08:40,312
''Beautiful girl..''

1329
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:21,949
''Like a thunder bolt which flashes
like a silver fish in the sky''

1330
02:09:23,722 --> 02:09:28,489
''Like a thunder bolt which
comes to earth at certain times''

1331
02:09:30,696 --> 02:09:37,295
''Keeps calling like a cool breeze''

1332
02:09:37,636 --> 02:09:44,041
''Look at the front, fellow some
one is there to become a groom''

1333
02:09:44,243 --> 02:09:48,179
''Beautiful girl..''
