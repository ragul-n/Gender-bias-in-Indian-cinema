1
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,558
Thank God, I thought

2
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,569
How could it?

3
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,563
Do you remember what I told you?

4
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,239
Yes, I remember every word.

5
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,510
Not even send you a letter. I can

6
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,706
Right. I too haven't told

7
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,450
Nor will I tell

8
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:05,643
him.

9
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,447
But it would have been

10
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,879
That is true but you are aware..

11
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,783
My brother sold our home, farm

12
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,061
He wanted to run his own business.

13
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,461
But he gave up that dream for me.

14
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,093
I'm not complaining,

15
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,164
I'll come to see you

16
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,939
Sure..?

17
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,221
Come here!

18
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,100
Who are you?
And how did you come in?

19
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,570
- Through that door.

20
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,439
Only if the door is open.

21
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,435
There's another difference

22
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,105
- What's that?

23
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,041
- Are you a man?

24
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,784
- Didn't you read the board?

25
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,457
Have we put the board

26
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,118
- Sorry.

27
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,461
Who are you? And whom

28
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,826
I'm Shantanu Mane,

29
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,102
- How?

30
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,631
We were born to the same parents.

31
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,142
All right. How long are

32
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,547
- Till I complete my education.

33
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,145
- Meaning...

34
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,143
It won't do. Can't afford to.

35
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:51,148
I won't put up with it. I..

36
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,559
- You stay here.

37
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,192
He's gone to fetch milk.

38
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,150
- What's wrong?

39
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,145
- What's the matter?

40
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,547
- Shall I drop you?

41
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:29,690
- Home. - No. I'll feel better

42
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,663
The queue is so long. It'll

43
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,201
- In the meantime, I'll..

44
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,534
Take this filled bottle

45
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,205
Don't worry at all. I'm free.

46
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,870
- Why trouble you..?

47
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,646
I don't know how to thank you.

48
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,614
Don't bother.

49
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,758
Now I feel better.

50
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,093
- The money..?

51
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,140
- When did you come?

52
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,642
Come on in.

53
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,850
The owner of this house is mean!

54
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,047
Softly. Doors have ears.

55
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,047
This one has eyes too.

56
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,051
- Dhananjay Mane! - Here..

57
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,761
Master! Welcome!!

58
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,937
- Welcome...- I came for..

59
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,167
Are we not fortunate that your

60
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,103
My day passes beautifully

61
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,940
- What I want to say is...

62
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,379
- What? - Sweet tea

63
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,311
- I have diabetes.

64
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:08,689
You'll have to pay Rs. 35 extra

65
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,327
I'd given this room only to you.

66
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,355
- We'll see..

67
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,760
Since yesterday I forgot

68
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,833
- Regarding..?

69
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,801
I tell you I suffer a lot.

70
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,770
- There's a medication for it.

71
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,375
- Sure shot cure.

72
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,780
- How does that help me?

73
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,852
Ask your friend to get it for me!

74
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,855
I'll be highly obliged

75
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,890
Why do you talk like that?

76
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,392
I'll do anything for you.

77
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,397
- But there's a problem.

78
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:50,093
- It's not major..

79
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,437
The medicine will cost Rs. 50

80
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,941
No, I'll pay for it.

81
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,705
But for now, my wallet is slim.

82
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,042
- Else I'd have done it.

83
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,811
You do so much for me.

84
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,652
What..? Tears in your eyes?

85
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,826
I can't spend Rs. 50 for

86
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,955
- What the..

87
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,764
Don't take it to heart.

88
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,369
- I can't spend 50 bucks..

89
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,707
- Just Rs. 50..

90
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,876
- Will you have tea?

91
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,710
But don't forget..

92
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,383
Our tenant is getting me

93
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,386
Brother, you are great!

94
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,982
I have to with him.

95
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,688
Else we can't survive. Anyway

96
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,396
- Yes? - Have you got

97
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,423
- Yes. - Got it? - Yes.

98
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,424
- Gave the address?

99
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,429
- Don't worry.

100
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,700
I found something while

101
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,302
Whose photo is this, only torso?

102
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,803
You found this photo?

103
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,313
- This photographer was great.

104
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,879
He sneezed so the torso

105
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,979
- But who are these?

106
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,323
That's Sudhir, me and Parsha.

107
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,826
What are they doing now?

108
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,693
They gather crowds

109
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,764
udhir tries to get

110
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,868
They are both together.

111
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,739
Our program went well.

112
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,607
Is this how we must Iive?

113
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,281
If that's God's will

114
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:50,287
I've written such a great play yet

115
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,285
Same with me. My uncle is

116
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,988
He abuses me everyday.

117
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,293
Do you have any shame?

118
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,228
I got a little late last night

119
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,669
For the past 1 0 days you've

120
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,701
- Last night you didn't get back

121
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,202
- Am I responsible for you?

122
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,942
- I looked after you since you're

123
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,207
You've grown up yet do you

124
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,209
-ls anything in this house yours?

125
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,621
Didn't I pester you to learn

126
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,220
-You did. - Sit outside the

127
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,218
And fill money orders and

128
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,256
- You did scream.

129
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,230
- I don't like such jobs.

130
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,859
Don't like it! But you like to

131
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,601
Nobody in our family ever

132
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,271
That's not my fault.

133
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,269
Don't say a word! Henceforth it's

134
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,272
- I have no strength!

135
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,617
- The world is yours..

136
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,548
- What do you mean?

137
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,222
- Where should I go?

138
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,825
But I don't have any money.

139
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,163
Beg or steal. Do what you wish

140
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,535
Now you won't get a sip of

141
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,550
- Dad.. - To blazes with him.

142
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,144
I mean forget him for the moment.

143
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,556
- See what I got you.

144
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,550
- A play written by me.

145
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,895
Yes. Tell your father I don't

146
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,563
Show him my play.

147
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,931
He may not have read

148
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,937
I will but drink tea

149
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,332
You're already late so

150
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,276
Let him. How long will he scream?

151
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,940
Here he comes..

152
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,012
Give me some tea.

153
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,880
- Good day master.

154
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,488
Is this the time to get here?

155
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:08,882
- I got a surprise for you.

156
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,493
I've employed you to buy

157
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,522
Will you go there

158
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:19,536
- Have you no shame?

159
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,540
- That's how I'm late.

160
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,544
I was saying I've

161
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,810
- Give him the bags.

162
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,952
- It's a play..

163
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,554
Very well but look at this once..

164
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,552
Today don't forget to buy

165
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,552
I will but please read this once.

166
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,600
- Actually..

167
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,934
God gave us arms to work.

168
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,267
The job your hands have

169
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,804
So don't try your hand at

170
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,982
Rs. 15 to buy stock.

171
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,815
Rs. 10 your labour for

172
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,155
And Rs. 8 for meals for the day.

173
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,092
Now just get to work!

174
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,992
Where's my tea?

175
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,366
Where are you off to?

176
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,037
-To test my destiny.

177
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,035
-Uncle threw me out.

178
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,037
- But where are you going?

179
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,438
- To see if I can find a job.

180
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,045
- I can some contacts.

181
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,716
- I don't.

182
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,055
- There's no other way.

183
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,648
Take this. It will help you.

184
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,060
- But you're not rich either.

185
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,762
And I'll manage. You need this more.

186
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,770
Don't say a word.

187
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,435
Let me know once you find a job.

188
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,845
Why do they let him carry on?

189
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:15,353
- We must complain? Who are you?

190
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,946
Women..! What?

191
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:24,725
- Why can't you come in time?

192
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,021
What? Cylinder empty.

193
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,364
- How will you cook?

194
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:34,397
It is. Suppose the

195
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,398
How can one be in time.

196
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,505
- Show me a good scent.

197
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,577
It's the name of the scent.

198
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,250
It's lovely. Buy it with

199
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,246
- Show me a soap.

200
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,089
Any good one.

201
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,761
What?? Look I'm busy in work.

202
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,755
- Don't bother me.

203
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,463
What the heck..! What message?

204
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,302
- She's called you immediately.

205
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,801
More than a fiat. Tell her

206
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,802
- I don't have time. I'll see

207
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,211
- Big trouble..Hira!

208
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,816
Show her some soap.

209
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,594
Madam, did you call me?

210
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,932
Busy with women?

211
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,363
Of course, that was in jest...

212
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,106
Today again you're late.

213
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,778
- When one..

214
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,774
It happens. I was to come in time.

215
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,787
But what fun...I left home in time.

216
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,714
But the cycle tyre got punctured.

217
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,720
Times are bad. The tyres

218
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,997
-..you couldn't cut them up..

219
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,361
I don't Iike uncivilised behaviour

220
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,705
If your cycle keeps getting

221
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,299
Their tyre also gets

222
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,109
Get back to work.

223
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,379
I don't Iike uncivilised behaviour!

224
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,380
It's wrong to push clients!

225
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,725
Get back to work!

226
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,999
Out!!

227
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:51,171
- Barging right in!

228
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:55,679
- Gardener.. - I'm no gardener.

229
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,342
- Forgive me. - Okay.

230
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,678
- What do you want with him?

231
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,822
- I'm his friend.

232
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:10,160
- Don't fib to me.

233
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,761
Come here. Listen to him

234
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,060
- See what he's saying.

235
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,769
- I am Sudhir.

236
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,805
Don't say that.

237
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,277
- We were such good friends..

238
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,472
- Crook..!

239
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,815
mistaken.

240
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,820
I'll take you there.

241
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,315
characters get in the house.

242
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,524
Then they rob us blind.

243
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,629
- Really?

244
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,388
- Enough!

245
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,004
- What's going on?

246
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,609
- What are you doing here?

247
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,784
- What does that mean?

248
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,947
I thought I'd come stay with you.

249
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,620
- Did you see the owner?

250
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,289
where else can I go?

251
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,954
Stay here but keep in mind

252
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,297
Your mode of entry and

253
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,599
Hey, porter!

254
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,939
Even if your father calls me

255
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,272
- Should I call you lover?

256
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,875
- Why did you come here?

257
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,582
true, I want to meet you, lies, wear
bangles

258
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,212
talk to each other in peace.

259
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,621
aaba gone to village,
so I thought of finding you

260
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,988
- Keep thinking such ideas.

261
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,595
- Give me the bag.

262
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,301
will feel we're a couple.

263
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,410
Frankly, I'm fed up of everything

264
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,040
- I know that.

265
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:17,786
Quit my good job, took this one with

266
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,720
But he turned me into a porter

267
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,791
But that's how we met.

268
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,988
But what did I get?

269
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,764
He threw it in the trash.

270
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,434
- Be patient, my sweet.

271
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,442
Your father is truly great.

272
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:43,439
He makes me slog all day

273
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,941
- Never pays for extra work.

274
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,453
I won't find a way out

275
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,450
Forget about that but

276
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,462
- We will find a way.

277
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,399
But I won't leave you.

278
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,369
Shameless! Is this the market?

279
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,367
- Father, l..

280
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,367
I had gone to the market.

281
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,872
Here's another 20.

282
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,381
- And get out of here!

283
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:22,378
I warn you, if I see you near

284
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,388
- Let's go!

285
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:47,377
aaba has insulted you,
I apologise because

286
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,581
Why do you bother?

287
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:57,381
today I am going To Pune.
What will you do there?

288
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,422
Mustn't I look for a job?

289
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,360
- How will we meet?

290
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,830
When your father comes to Pune..

291
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,303
I'II read the poster

292
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,166
Take your script book.

293
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,238
I don't want it. I've

294
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,518
I've decided to work hard

295
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:34,517
Don't lose hope. I'll show this

296
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,927
Do as you please.

297
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:47,567
I just came here to see you.

298
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,073
I'm leaving.

299
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,014
Don't cry. I will waver in my resolve

300
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,524
But where will you stay in Pune?

301
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,453
Don't worry. I have a friend there.

302
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,466
He'll do anything for me.

303
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,304
Stop right here!

304
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,735
- Here's the fare.

305
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,482
Kamli's father suddenly fired me

306
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:37,146
- And what about the play?

307
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,752
- I must find a job.

308
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,153
- Where will you stay?

309
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,997
- I'll stay with you.

310
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,501
Why am I dead? The owner

311
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,531
He didn't let Sudhya stay here.

312
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:59,933
I've hidden him in the house

313
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,976
Why do you worry?

314
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,482
- So one more.

315
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:08,984
Talk softly.

316
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,287
- Parshya!

317
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,953
- He's come looking for a job.

318
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,662
We'll hoodwink him.

319
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,471
- Wake him up!

320
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,405
Meet him in the morning.

321
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,012
What else could have happened

322
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,417
I wanted to throw him out!

323
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:44,020
- But he threw you out first.

324
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,423
I will do that but I need money.

325
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:53,029
- Me..? I am stone broke.

326
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,396
But I spend it all.

327
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:01,636
- Just Rs. 20..

328
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,509
You follow me.

329
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,349
- What I was saying...

330
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,258
- Who is this third man?

331
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,864
Him...? He's Shantanu's friend.

332
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,868
Came this morning to study.

333
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,870
Did you ever study?

334
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,912
- 3 of you stay here..

335
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,904
How come there are 4 cups?

336
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,920
I need 2 cups of tea every morning.

337
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,184
You are like my group.

338
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,927
- We do the same.

339
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,422
Does Dhananjay Mane live here?

340
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,631
Welcome, Parshuram.

341
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,244
He's my friend. I told

342
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,853
- Very good.

343
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:28,587
- Why am I going there?

344
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:33,124
And you said, it'll cost

345
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,863
- Rs. 70

346
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,869
- Yes.. - You want it?

347
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,897
- He says Rs. 70.

348
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,909
Here's another Rs. 20.

349
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,506
Don't worry, he'll get it.

350
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,415
He'll get it. Yes.

351
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,919
- See you.

352
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,915
- What about lsrael?

353
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,325
Why should I bother?

354
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,522
Your qualification is fine.

355
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,798
Join us as a singing

356
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:15,497
- Thank you.

357
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,103
- Why you? - Your job

358
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,581
- Are you mad? - Why?

359
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:32,155
- He'll throw us out.

360
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,419
- They bought tickets?

361
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:41,494
- Hear his good news? - What?

362
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,666
Really? Congratulations.

363
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,170
Just oral wishes?

364
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,700
The throat feels parched.

365
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,212
Do whatever you have to outside.

366
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,607
Don't involve me or disturb my

367
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,742
Let us go out.

368
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:26,068
- No path ahead

369
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:30,743
- The house...?

370
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:35,077
- Take a look.

371
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,422
Let's go in.

372
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,930
Open..climbed for nothing.

373
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,425
Uncle keeps saying don't drink.

374
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:00,908
I haven't fallen

375
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,415
Softly.

376
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,854
Must be fast asleep.

377
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,363
You knock softly. I'll knock hard.

378
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,898
Who's knocking at midnight.

379
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,804
Coming...

380
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,911
Shantanu, you took

381
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,745
We've been knocking so long.

382
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,918
Good you opened soon enough.

383
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,082
EIse the boor Iandlord

384
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,926
Mr. Mane!

385
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,430
Calling your elder brother by his

386
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,436
Insolent! Quiet..

387
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,372
The bald dog will

388
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,410
Dog!!

389
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:13,848
If the bald guy finds out

390
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,858
We fooled him for so many days

391
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,360
I tell you...!

392
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:31,799
- Hold his mouth shut.

393
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,063
What is going on?

394
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,878
Who is she..?

395
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,747
Mane, you are a scoundrel!

396
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,665
Parshya..brother!!

397
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,335
- The landlord is here..

398
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,692
I never thought

399
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,695
- Here's the paper.

400
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,698
Hold it..I see him!

401
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,200
Come out!

402
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,704
You called me bald!!

403
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,206
Is Dhananjay in..?

404
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,207
Yes, I know him well. Rascal!!

405
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,076
Shameless! Have you no shame?

406
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,147
Did you think I didn't

407
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,013
- I was to tell you..

408
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,289
I came to tell you to

409
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,953
Forgive us for the

410
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,695
Little mess..? You said, little!

411
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,365
You created such a scene

412
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:14,226
- Forgive us this once.

413
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,639
- Yes.

414
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,668
- Let me speak...

415
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,840
I beg you. Think of

416
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,342
Where will we go if

417
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,346
I don't care whether you

418
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,690
I have no place for

419
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,351
I will complain to the police!

420
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:42,095
Return the money I gave

421
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,698
- But your diabetes..

422
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:51,069
Vacate the house or I'll

423
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:07,290
- Now what do we do?

424
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:14,558
Parshya and Sudhya,

425
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,226
- You too.

426
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,727
- To blazes with it. - But..

427
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,863
Only 2 days before you leave my
house

428
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,571
Hey, come here..

429
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,382
- Aren't you on leave?

430
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,919
- But I don't see him.

431
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,354
- I'll have to wait 15 minutes.

432
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,919
Don't screw up or

433
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,431
Is Madam well? I mean

434
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,262
She's fine.

435
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,936
- Madam has called you.

436
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,931
- He's working, I'm on leave.

437
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,543
Won't spare me even on leave.

438
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,443
What are you waiting for?

439
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,981
Why haven't I still

440
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:44,185
You keep gassing at work.

441
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,515
If you're feeling breathless

442
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,426
I am on Ieave.

443
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,924
How will I give any report?

444
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:57,425
- Then why didn't you say so?

445
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,299
You were shooting like a machine
gun.

446
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,370
You didn't let me open my mouth.

447
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,872
I forgot you were on leave.

448
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,914
May I request you to talk

449
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,918
- Meaning?

450
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,253
- I offer you tea to make up,

451
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,928
Take a seat.

452
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,589
You're even offering me tea?

453
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,331
- Why? - Excuse me.

454
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,267
To check if the sun rose in the west

455
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,965
I'm sure it made a mistake.

456
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,967
Drink the tea.

457
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,682
You just took leave or

458
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,714
- Meaning? - Marriage

459
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,986
Nothing of that sort. I'm ready

460
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,659
- What kind of girl do you want?

461
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:10,005
Good looking. I don't mind

462
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,373
- I'd like somebody like you.

463
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:19,048
I mean easy to get along,

464
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:27,047
Forget it. Thanks for offering

465
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,719
I'II take Ieave.

466
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,262
where have you been?

467
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,871
- Have you joined back?

468
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,566
Is the room you suggested been
taken?

469
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,501
No, she hasn't got

470
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,913
- You go and inquire.

471
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,916
A widow, Leelabai Kalbhor.

472
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,318
- Hello. - Hello.

473
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:05,559
- You are..? - Dhananjay Mane.

474
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,831
- But I have some conditions.

475
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,562
I live here alone with my maid.

476
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:17,673
Earlier I had no fears but now

477
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,210
One eye has been operated upon.

478
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,813
So you have a problem.

479
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:30,219
Yes. I need some help so l

480
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,220
What does that mean?

481
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,560
I don't want to give the place

482
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:43,165
I didn't find the kind of tenant

483
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,828
- We understand..

484
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,173
He's after my life.

485
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,211
Therefore I need some help.

486
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,214
I want to give the place

487
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,551
We'll take leave. We can't fulfill

488
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,488
- I liked the house.

489
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,561
She wants a couple and I can't

490
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,666
- Adding to our problems.

491
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,167
No point cursing our luck.

492
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,439
Look there..

493
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,411
- What about the place?

494
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,078
There is one place but not for us.

495
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,849
- As usual let's return.

496
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:40,346
Hold it. Excuse me for a minute.

497
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,360
- Come here!

498
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:50,357
Read that board. I know

499
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,361
He has 2 flats. He won't

500
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,872
All right. We're used to

501
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,340
Like girls turned down for marriage.

502
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,480
You wait here. I'll see him

503
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,500
Brother, is that Bal Gandharva?

504
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,003
Yes, it is him.

505
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,542
- And that's Mrs. Bal Gandharva?

506
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,979
Say it softly else

507
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:41,983
There's been no artist who

508
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,486
He says it's Mrs. Gandharva..

509
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,083
Let's go. Uncle ditched us.

510
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,085
He sold both flats to a builder.

511
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,688
- This day has turned to dust.

512
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,960
Every attempt has failed

513
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,699
No, we'll have to do this!

514
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,206
All three of you wait

515
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,671
- I'll get there soon.

516
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,174
Here's Rs. 200, advance for the place

517
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,017
- You remember all I said.

518
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,522
My worries are over.

519
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:57,850
- We'll have to.. - Pardon?

520
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,527
I'll show you.

521
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,726
- What's wrong with you?

522
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,390
- Won a lottery?

523
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,699
Mane and company are leaving our
room

524
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,327
Could there be any greater joy?

525
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:46,970
- That's all? - No, I'll charge

526
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:52,980
I wasn't this happy

527
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,121
Then perform another prayer

528
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,655
Prayer for these scoundrels? Forget

529
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,662
- That reminds me..

530
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,658
I'd given them our old broom.

531
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,665
They'll run away with it.

532
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,606
- Doomed!

533
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,609
- Have they taken the broom?

534
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:32,954
Never did I imagine this

535
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,547
- What has he done?

536
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,326
He drank and created a scene

537
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,557
God alone knows what

538
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,559
Anyway they're leaving.

539
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:51,440
Once they leave, sanctify

540
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:57,343
Here they come. Do you have any

541
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,380
We'll take it along.

542
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,385
I never imagined you'd be such louts.

543
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,348
You drink alcohol and

544
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,222
I bet you also gamble.

545
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:16,792
Vishwas Sarpotdar, shut the

546
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,527
They're our wives not other women!

547
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:23,202
Don't fib. From where did

548
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,807
Don't wives appear

549
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,812
- How come I don't know?

550
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,805
Our uncle?

551
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,475
How did you get married

552
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,151
It's about Iove.

553
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,086
- Had to get married.

554
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,259
Want to meet them?

555
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,161
This is Parvati, my wife.

556
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:51,760
Good day.

557
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,798
This is Sudha, Shantanu's wife.

558
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,241
Hello.

559
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,747
Come on, they're like family.

560
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,751
I told you about him?

561
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,749
- Him..? - He may not look

562
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,751
- Kept the bags..?

563
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,260
- Shall we leave?

564
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,764
It's such a good time.

565
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,400
- I won't let them leave

566
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,771
Come on. I won't let you leave.

567
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,072
Your wife...don't give any gifts.

568
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,208
We don't have any to waste.

569
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,248
That's what I meant..

570
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:47,756
Married women must wear vermilion

571
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,759
- We'll take leave..

572
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,762
Oh yes. Which finger..?

573
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,197
Let's go.

574
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:02,338
Let's go, ladies. Hurry up.

575
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:07,733
- Very well..

576
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,745
Take care. You're losing hair.

577
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,413
- Hurry up!

578
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:24,759
Pay back the money for

579
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:30,759
I'd told you about my

580
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,767
He died in an accident.

581
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,770
The money you gave him died with
him

582
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,309
- This is deceitful.

583
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,207
- What you're doing.

584
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,816
We've been paying for 35 bucks

585
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,284
Daily you take our paper to read

586
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,479
And keep the money

587
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,824
See what a rascal your husband is!

588
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,485
- Aren't you leaving?

589
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:02,228
What brides! They

590
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,560
- Come in, I'll do it.

591
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,311
How much? Here...

592
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,317
You're a housewife.

593
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,321
Nobody will blame you but

594
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,586
- You selected us. Don't crib,

595
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,918
Brother, how many days

596
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:36,264
- How long do we pretend?

597
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,963
Is it true we have a housing snag?

598
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,962
So we spend a few months here.

599
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,966
- How will I manage?

600
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,309
Isn't it true that

601
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,979
We're not cheating her.

602
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,973
But what exactly must we do?

603
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,984
Nothing much. Just behave

604
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,789
He has a job so we must say

605
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,656
So when he leaves home,

606
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,659
Then he changes garb

607
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,864
How do I hunt for a job?

608
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,924
Everyone doesn't have to work.

609
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,700
You are the wife

610
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,568
You have to work at home.

611
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,809
All of you will be out

612
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,778
You too can go out but as Parvati.

613
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,976
- Nobody will have any doubts

614
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,254
And girls, go in and

615
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,655
Or you'll stand upright!

616
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,760
When we go inside. Come on!

617
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,959
Welcome, you're just in time.

618
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,893
Good day.

619
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,630
You know me. I'm Dhananjay Mane

620
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,902
- Bless me.

621
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,247
- She's very docile.

622
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,912
She's from Kolhapur.

623
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:08,756
- I'm younger to you.

624
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,993
When God desires.

625
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:15,262
This is my younger brother,
Shantanu

626
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,767
And that is Sudha, his wife

627
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,296
- Bless me too.

628
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,806
They make a good couple.

629
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,570
To lash out. At other couples.

630
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,972
They just got married.

631
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,650
And Shantanu is studying

632
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:39,254
- Does your wife also work?

633
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,655
- That is true.

634
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,590
- Yes. - May we go..?

635
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:48,694
- I feel supported.

636
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,764
See you. Come, dear.

637
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,468
I'm fed up in 2 hours. Wonder how

638
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,507
- Don't ever want to be a woman.

639
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,441
- It's poking me..

640
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:13,252
Yes. Have you got some food?

641
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,517
- Lay the table.

642
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,227
What a wife you got me!

643
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:25,366
At least your wife is pretty.

644
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,867
And I have to live with a hippo.

645
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,306
Come into the room, I'll

646
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,338
See you, dear.

647
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,840
- Eating in make up is a drag.

648
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,112
Lentils..?

649
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,184
Wait, I'll check.

650
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,828
- Please come in.

651
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,330
- We were just starting.

652
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:02,302
You still have to set up home.

653
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:07,709
Why.. I mean pickle adds

654
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,311
I don't know how to thank you.

655
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:14,807
What favour. This is how

656
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,717
Tell me if you need anything.

657
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:23,825
- Don't hesitate. - Sister-in-law,

658
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:30,331
Of course, I'll teach her.

659
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:32,294
- Just call me aunt.

660
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:52,619
Little sister, you're newly married

661
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,656
Feed your husband

662
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,159
- I feel shy..

663
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:03,098
When we were married, for 3 months

664
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:07,798
That's how he's so healthy.

665
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,803
- Sudha, take his name.

666
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:18,146
India sent a rocket to space'

667
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,139
'And destiny sent me Shantanu'

668
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,286
Where are you going?

669
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:34,289
- I came to see you off. - Go in!

670
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,631
- Now why is he calling me?

671
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,802
That servant, Tanu

672
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,333
Be vigilant.

673
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,343
What a woman!

674
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:55,077
- Don't touch me. - Why?

675
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,810
- Very commendable. - I'm going

676
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,287
We have many flowers in

677
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,292
'My name is Chameli'

678
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,293
'I'm a distinct gardener'

679
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,329
'I've come alone from Kolhapur'

680
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,150
Madam has called you.

681
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:40,926
- Going to be welcomed again.

682
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,529
Must you poke your nose?

683
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,532
Mane, come in. Take a seat.

684
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,942
- You..

685
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,544
- I'm very happy today.

686
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,979
Do you feel happy?

687
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,483
- Am I not human?

688
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,887
You're no ordinary man.

689
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,154
- Have a sweet.

690
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:13,494
- What exam did you clear?

691
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,930
- It's a marriage sweet.

692
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,260
A sweet for the marriage being fixed

693
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:23,265
- Are you getting married?

694
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,542
- Congratulations!

695
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:29,976
Why are you congratulating me?

696
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,481
Now your line is clear.

697
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,819
- What..?

698
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,818
- Why?

699
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,484
hand.

700
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,862
Bother..? I thought you'll

701
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,934
- Accompany me to a

702
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,473
I want to buy 2 sarees for sister.

703
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,741
- Help me.

704
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:10,986
- How is this one?

705
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:12,748
I don't think she'II wear it.

706
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,890
This saree is nice.

707
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,994
- Is it yours..?

708
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,500
- This is a nice colour.

709
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,133
- But will it look good on her?

710
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,131
Then take it. Show me

711
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:39,742
- This is a nice colour.

712
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,982
I meant for you, not her.

713
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:48,489
Don't be mad but this will look

714
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,494
Forgive me for being explicit.

715
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,996
If you're offended..

716
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,499
Send the bill across.

717
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,806
Open the door.

718
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,078
Come in, aunt.

719
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,820
I smell bidi. Who is smoking?

720
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,815
Me..I'm wondering the same.

721
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,226
Then I remembered I roasted

722
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,519
The aroma is still wafting around.

723
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:31,195
Okay. I asked Tanu to get you

724
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:36,530
Give it to her.

725
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,873
- For what?

726
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,277
So many women have borne

727
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,878
- I'll eat it later.

728
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,272
- Later..

729
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:52,284
- Glory to Niranjan Baba.

730
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,354
- They seem different.

731
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,894
- Now..?

732
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:06,935
After my operation everything

733
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:09,664
I'll take you to Baba once.

734
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,440
God! What's wrong with my memory?

735
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:18,946
I'm going for a christening.

736
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,351
- You'll make some friends.

737
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:25,951
My husband will soon be back.

738
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,152
he'll bring down the house!

739
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,893
Don't refuse him. A wife's first

740
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:37,427
- I'll take Tanu. You must

741
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,402
Want some?

742
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,107
Hold your saree properly.

743
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,839
Stupid! Have you no sense?

744
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,109
- Smoking away1 - In the hall!

745
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:58,119
Don't worry. Nobody is home.

746
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,553
Aunt has come for a

747
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,059
- Any problems? - No

748
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,355
- What about Tanu..?

749
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,597
She is sure we're women!

750
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,101
Meaning our acting is successful!

751
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,871
Who are you?

752
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,265
And what are you doing

753
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,270
We're tenants..

754
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:54,615
- And you are..?

755
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:56,611
And this is Sushma, my friend.

756
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:00,551
I am Dhananjay Mane and

757
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,990
That is Sudha, my younger

758
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,560
- Where is he..?

759
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:12,327
My husband is so shy!

760
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,330
Get up.

761
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,340
- Aunt!!

762
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:32,686
Gave you a surprise! You

763
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,690
- Dhananjay, she's my..

764
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:41,118
- Do you recognise Sushma,

765
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,729
She's studying in Nigri and

766
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,467
So I got her here.

767
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,403
I've decided we mustn't stay here.

768
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:00,942
- It's risky. - We know

769
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:07,347
Quietly pack your bags. If we

770
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,188
- How?

771
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,690
Why are you yelling?

772
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:15,120
- Ask your brother.

773
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,728
It's wise to Ieave.

774
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,066
Have you lost your mind?

775
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,732
Where will we sleep? On the
footpath?

776
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,002
Or in a hutment!

777
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,332
And what about your studies?

778
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:30,177
He is right. Things will be

779
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,682
No, it won't. We did

780
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,012
Where can we go?

781
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,718
Don't act smart. Put the bag in.

782
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,688
Acts as if he's lost his mind!

783
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,691
- Parsha, come here.

784
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,990
Tomorrow we have to

785
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,130
We have to label medicine

786
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:55,399
Husband dear, it's okay if

787
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,738
Can't afford to sit idle at home.

788
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:06,009
Aunt! Where is the album

789
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:09,182
- On the cupboard.

790
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:15,154
We'll have to use a stool.

791
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,052
- He'll take it down.

792
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:28,168
A woman's life is terrible.

793
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,671
- Now you realise..

794
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,676
- Dhananjay!

795
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,675
At least listen to me.

796
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,687
You called out for Dhananjay

797
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:50,690
I just had to convey

798
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:55,991
She can't take an album off the

799
01:08:56,832 --> 01:09:00,928
So why are you going. Take

800
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,671
- Forget it. - Why?

801
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,334
Couldn't find a smaller one? Go.

802
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:15,011
Meet me once. I have

803
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,684
- I don't want to talk.

804
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,289
- Go away, we'll remove the album.

805
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,385
If I get angry, a scene

806
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,162
- Shantanu, it's you?

807
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,131
- Where's the album?

808
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,207
Be careful.

809
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,736
Oh God! This hurts!

810
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,749
The boy is hurt. Manisha..

811
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:53,086
You've got henna on your palms.

812
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:57,118
Hurry, he's hurt.

813
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,191
Not much. But..it hurts!

814
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,797
Don't give it to me.

815
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,394
Apply it to the wound.

816
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:08,793
Gently, dear.

817
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:19,476
- Aunt, now it feels better.

818
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:22,475
Sometimes it's the hand

819
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,412
Goodness! What happened?

820
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,758
- He fell off the stool.

821
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,785
Why are you taunting him?

822
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:39,191
It's a vicious cycle. He fell off

823
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,460
Then we got involved and married.

824
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:45,305
He's always falling somewhere.

825
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,805
- He'll fall there too.

826
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,472
- Making fun..is your

827
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,816
I should thank you, dear.

828
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:59,321
- No need..- Of course

829
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,752
right on time and so gently..

830
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,453
Make me some coffee.

831
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:10,126
Excuse me, it's true we

832
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,799
But for now we don't have a vacancy

833
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:18,805
- Is she your wife?

834
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,307
Her husband left her.

835
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:25,073
Hold it. Since then

836
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:30,012
- Brother!!

837
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:35,755
- Cries all the time.

838
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:39,789
He'll let you know.

839
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:45,060
- He said.. - Come on.

840
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:48,461
- Even as a woman nobody will

841
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,805
- I have to go to work.

842
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:54,808
Good God!

843
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:01,740
- Can't you read?

844
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:05,415
- Women go here.

845
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:07,116
Smart girl.

846
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:11,257
I'm going..

847
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:17,525
- lngle! What's going on?

848
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,297
Don't you have to clean

849
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,235
Clean up before madam cleans us up.

850
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,739
I'II hold the boxes

851
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,903
We're doomed. The sound

852
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,246
- Has madam called me?

853
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:38,411
- What is in her hand?

854
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,420
Nothing madam. Ingle

855
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,121
I told him to dust it.

856
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,792
But they fell down.

857
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:51,130
- Just a little powder on the floor

858
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,801
I only heard powder fell down.

859
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:58,805
They're powder tins. They have

860
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:05,475
Why should I be excited? Powder

861
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:14,515
Actually you don't

862
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:18,092
- It happens at times.

863
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:22,796
Absolutely fine. I can

864
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:27,131
- But not the near ones.

865
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,235
Forget it. Sit down.

866
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,733
- Do you like lemon pickle?

867
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,738
The mention makes my mouth water.

868
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,248
Lemon pickle, lemon

869
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:45,081
- What..?

870
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,413
I was rambling..

871
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,758
But I love anything with lemons.

872
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,794
That is why that day in the

873
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,743
Madam, you look so good.

874
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,245
You're really looking beautiful.

875
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,749
You realised it pretty early.

876
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:17,750
I feel like only looking at you.

877
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:25,382
May I say something

878
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:30,731
If you use light coloured

879
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,997
I had no right to reach your lips

880
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:41,233
I'II take Ieave. The customers

881
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,747
The old woman is at home.

882
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,450
Aunt. I am here.

883
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,385
Like last time, I must

884
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,390
- Are you my nephew or a foe?

885
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,926
- And quietly give the money.

886
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,736
You blew up your estate

887
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,404
- You should feel ashamed...!

888
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:17,073
You have no heir after you're dead

889
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,404
I will inherit your estate.

890
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,406
so I asked for some part in advance

891
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:23,684
- Go away!

892
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,680
- God! - Even God won't

893
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,688
Shameless! I'll show you!

894
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,724
You..!

895
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,734
Get lost!

896
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:46,240
- I'll see you someday!

897
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,742
Seen your face?

898
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,748
I never dreamed that

899
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:58,077
- Who was that?

900
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:02,687
He spent his entire estate and

901
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:05,690
But he troubles me for money.

902
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,318
You saved me.

903
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:13,233
Let him come again, I'll

904
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:17,236
As a kid in Kolhapur,

905
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,330
- And..

906
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:23,174
See you.

907
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:33,676
- Is there much work at the bank?

908
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:37,383
- I want to work when

909
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:40,727
- When will you get married?

910
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,128
Why? Haven't you fallen in love?

911
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:47,730
Falling in love is not as easy

912
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:52,231
Honestly, one must find

913
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,140
So you have his picture in mind?

914
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:58,745
- Tell me.

915
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:03,682
- I swear.

916
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,346
Important, eyes covered by goggle

917
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:11,122
Pipe in mouth, swinging a key on

918
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:14,728
- But he should like me.

919
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,230
At least you have

920
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,733
Fell in love with the first man.

921
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,396
- Will I meet him?

922
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,668
May your mouth be sweetened.

923
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,336
And may his mouth be

924
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:27,935
You...!

925
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,286
- This doesn't behove you.

926
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,186
At least listen to me.

927
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:44,189
You want justify why you fooled me?

928
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,455
Let's sit under the tree.

929
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,736
Speak from a distance.

930
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:05,336
I can understand your anger but

931
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:12,345
You may not know it but

932
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,687
She won't live longer than 6 months

933
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:20,693
What..? What are you saying?

934
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,388
In spite of that I married her.

935
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:25,657
Did you think I'm a fool?

936
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:29,660
I had to keep the promise

937
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:32,330
- And the promise to me..?

938
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:37,168
Sudha is my father's friend's

939
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,679
your daughter will enter

940
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,675
- And that friend died.

941
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:47,115
On his death-bed, my

942
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,986
when I took the water,

943
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:54,193
Shantanu! Make me a promise..

944
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,229
Or I won't drink water.

945
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,131
I had no option but to agree.

946
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,170
Do you know what promise

947
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:07,071
- What?

948
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:10,176
He knew of her short life.

949
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,679
Yet he made me promise

950
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,340
And he peacefully shut his eyes.

951
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:20,686
I know my marital life

952
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:26,692
How can I leave her in this state?

953
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,731
Only I know how I live!

954
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:38,238
I can understand your

955
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,742
Yes but you just banish

956
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,079
I have a lot to tell you.

957
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:49,749
But not right away.

958
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:55,755
Goodness! It's late. I must

959
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:02,295
Children, you must memorise

960
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,394
- Else I'll be angry.

961
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:08,199
- Good day sir.

962
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:13,807
- Who are you..? - From

963
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:18,812
- Any problem?

964
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:21,473
- Are you Mr. Sudhir?

965
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,750
We heard a few of your programs.

966
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:27,755
And we decided to cut

967
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:32,251
Is that true..? That's great news.

968
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:36,455
- I accept.

969
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:40,299
Here's the pen and Rs. 1000

970
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:22,808
- Do you want to die?

971
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,406
Get your eyes checked!

972
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,405
I'm not at fault. She is

973
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:30,147
Thank God she's not hurt

974
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,410
Go to Hell! Who do you think you
are?

975
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,186
- I'll show you!!

976
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,760
- Take care of your hero.

977
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:44,790
Why create a scene.

978
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,463
All because of you.

979
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,805
- I don't even know you.

980
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,209
Shall we have coffee

981
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:58,206
You'll get calm and I'll

982
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:04,751
I was so astounded at seeing you

983
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,178
- Why? Have I sprouted horns?

984
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,286
- Then?

985
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:12,758
She has rented out some rooms

986
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,798
- What's surprising about that?

987
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,801
- If she wears men's clothing..

988
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:25,740
- And I'll look like her

989
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:30,743
That's not surprising because

990
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:37,147
- But you never come to see her.

991
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:40,753
I don't approve of her

992
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:44,450
- He's still studying.

993
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,788
I tried convincing her but

994
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:51,126
Seeing Shantanu I lose my shirt.

995
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:52,796
- So I never meet her.

996
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,792
I Iike her a Iot!

997
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,065
I'm dying to tell her I met you!

998
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,138
- What do you do?

999
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,743
Very soon my cassette

1000
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,747
Seeing your dress, nobody

1001
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,250
The voice lies in

1002
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:14,753
- Don't you like my dress?

1003
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:20,759
- But I invited you.

1004
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:25,730
Shall I leave? It's late.

1005
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,237
Pashan Road. Hurry.

1006
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,244
Hurry to..

1007
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,752
It's an urgent case. Will you

1008
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,126
- Where's Sudha?

1009
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,799
Today is Sunday.

1010
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:05,067
She must've gone to a friends'

1011
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:09,238
I had exciting news for her.

1012
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:13,405
What? Sudha's twin!!

1013
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:18,250
Strange..She never mentioned

1014
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,722
Sudha returned long back.

1015
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,229
Hurry and come out!

1016
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:36,137
- What is it?

1017
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:41,240
Sit out in the hall.

1018
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:43,208
- Hurry up. - Sure.

1019
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:52,413
Shut the door.

1020
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:56,754
What a man you are!

1021
01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:59,285
You don't worry at all

1022
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:04,388
- I'll sort it out my way.

1023
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:08,735
Important news!!

1024
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,236
- What's important about that?

1025
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:16,242
Chaggurao's drama has come to
Pune.

1026
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,745
- Is that all?

1027
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,740
Kamli too must've come.

1028
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:25,342
- Don't mess up anything..

1029
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:28,686
Go as Parvati to meet her.

1030
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:32,691
Meet my beloved as a woman..

1031
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:36,388
He is right. Nobody will suspect you

1032
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:38,731
Not even her Pop!

1033
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:57,917
My goodness! How you've grown!

1034
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:01,255
Who are you? I don't know you!

1035
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:05,448
We've been soul mates for lives.

1036
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,860
Don't get too affectionate!

1037
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,890
Then whom should I be loving to?

1038
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,901
I don't even...

1039
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,403
Parshya..!

1040
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:23,309
- But why the disguise..?

1041
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:26,412
- Where's your old man?

1042
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,505
Who fears him?

1043
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:32,852
- Making plenty of moolah?

1044
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,856
- Barely managing to cut even.

1045
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:38,849
I have to think about her marriage.

1046
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:43,157
There are plenty of grooms in

1047
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:46,228
Your daughter is good.

1048
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,902
The gentleman sitting

1049
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:55,305
I think father is back!

1050
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:59,571
Why are you afraid? Let his

1051
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:01,176
Open the door.

1052
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:07,512
Whom were you talking to?

1053
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:14,860
- Who is this?

1054
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:20,400
Father, this is Parvati. She

1055
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:23,493
But I wasn't in your

1056
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,405
She would come to play with me.

1057
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:30,341
And you'd pinch my cheeks

1058
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:35,177
- Now do you recall?

1059
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:40,352
I'd dance Iike this...

1060
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:45,118
Now I recall. But does she live here?

1061
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:48,555
She's now married.

1062
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:52,296
She's grown solid!

1063
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,559
My husband too is sturdy.

1064
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:58,302
Now get Kamli married soon.

1065
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,433
- That's what I'm trying...

1066
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:06,346
I mean she was saying,

1067
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,850
Don't take his name!

1068
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,444
- What wrong has he done?

1069
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:17,524
I kept him to buy stock.

1070
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:20,859
Instead of carrying bags,

1071
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:25,889
- Suppose he's nice..?

1072
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:29,495
He's not worthy to stand before me!

1073
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:32,838
- I employ many like him!

1074
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:36,502
What if one of your

1075
01:28:37,945 --> 01:28:39,845
Kamli seems to have told you a lot

1076
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:43,846
We're old friends.

1077
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,849
My heart beats hard for her.

1078
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:50,856
She will get the groom

1079
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,860
He will love her so much

1080
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:59,160
- He'll hold her tight..

1081
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,572
See you, uncle.

1082
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:19,578
I'll see you everyday as long

1083
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,987
See you later.

1084
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:31,762
I got such a start.

1085
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,168
- I like one quality about you.

1086
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:41,401
In spite of heart ache

1087
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:47,680
- There's no choice.

1088
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:50,683
- Learnt what..?

1089
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:56,689
- About me..?

1090
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,193
- About what?

1091
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:04,389
Look, take care of yourself.

1092
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:07,995
we must decide how

1093
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:12,397
- what are you saying..

1094
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,741
You don't have to worry.

1095
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:19,745
- What are you saying..

1096
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:22,475
See you then.

1097
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:27,412
Junior Mane, why is

1098
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:29,345
Come in, I'll tell you.

1099
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:32,690
Come here and tell me

1100
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:35,853
Nothing much. Just that

1101
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:39,698
- Have you no shame?

1102
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:42,725
I met her when I was studying

1103
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:48,402
I want her to be in my life

1104
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:53,746
- You know, everything...

1105
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,410
Welcome...

1106
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,685
- What are you doing here?

1107
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:05,057
- Just take the name..

1108
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:08,125
Not mine but name the article.

1109
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,695
Show me some shades of nail polish.

1110
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,698
- You'll probably want

1111
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:21,400
Since you girls cut your hair,

1112
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:25,244
You want nail polish?

1113
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,247
Let me see your nails.

1114
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:32,082
Is this the way to show nails?

1115
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:36,689
Nice ones..Iooks like you chew them

1116
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,350
Wear this shade. It will suit you.

1117
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:46,197
- Let me see..are they real?

1118
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:51,327
- I meant.. - Take what

1119
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,399
- This is not the place to chat.

1120
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:56,742
- Strict.. - You be quiet.

1121
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:00,011
- Okay. Can I give them lipstick?

1122
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:05,684
- You're in trouble.

1123
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:09,348
Your mother-in-law is sitting

1124
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,661
You talk too much with

1125
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:22,265
- I have to keep them in good mood

1126
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:25,000
- Salesmen only make sales.

1127
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,936
I say one word and these

1128
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:31,209
- Now take your...

1129
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:34,873
- Those girls are close to me.

1130
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:38,717
- Like family..

1131
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,221
They are the nieces of the

1132
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:45,222
What was the need to hold

1133
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:48,218
- If somebody asks for lipstick..

1134
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:53,231
From a distance I can see what

1135
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:58,263
I had told you this shade

1136
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:00,704
You look very pretty!

1137
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:04,210
Were those girls really

1138
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:07,213
Yes. One is Sushma,

1139
01:33:07,715 --> 01:33:10,206
My landlady's name is

1140
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,213
She has a big house on Pashan.

1141
01:33:13,654 --> 01:33:16,214
No need but be warned..

1142
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:18,222
Stay away from women.

1143
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,885
Salesman acting close to

1144
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,258
Neither do I like it.

1145
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:26,731
I see.

1146
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:33,705
Give me a bidi.

1147
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:36,606
Hurry up!

1148
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:40,940
Glaring as if he's never seen a lady

1149
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,997
Lady, now where will you go?

1150
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:03,263
Quietly leave my path.

1151
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:06,996
You enjoyed beating me up that day

1152
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:10,004
Don't you have a mother or sister?

1153
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:13,512
I'll show you what I'm made of!

1154
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:17,346
Cursed! Have you no shame

1155
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:24,524
Let go! I say..! You're

1156
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:28,992
- Let go!

1157
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:35,000
Why do you keep saying that? Help!

1158
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:45,010
- Don't scream!

1159
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:49,514
Scoundrel!

1160
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:52,415
Thrash him hard!

1161
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,417
What..?

1162
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:59,525
You got away because your husband

1163
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:01,787
Enough! Finished!

1164
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:07,192
I don't want to Iive in this

1165
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:09,260
- But what happened?

1166
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:11,604
Bali molested me on the road!

1167
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,106
Had Dhananjay not come,

1168
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,267
I'd have no face Ieft..

1169
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,611
But we are looking for a place.

1170
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,615
We saw one place but can't

1171
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:26,345
Let's get out of here or

1172
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:29,555
- Why do you fear Bali?

1173
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:34,025
We'll be exposed if he

1174
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:35,589
So don't step out.

1175
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:38,999
If someone asks why Parvati

1176
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,600
If somebody asks...

1177
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:48,106
- There is a way. - What?

1178
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:52,611
- Terrific! - No, first you

1179
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:55,614
Here I'm dreaming of marrying

1180
01:35:56,117 --> 01:35:58,278
- First mom, then Dad.

1181
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,553
Didn't you say Leelabai gave

1182
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:05,556
She'll be so happy thinking

1183
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:08,992
- Play along. - No..

1184
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:12,564
Very well. Now what?

1185
01:36:16,871 --> 01:36:18,168
Come in.

1186
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:22,207
- Where's Sushma?

1187
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:27,880
Did you meet your brother?

1188
01:36:28,983 --> 01:36:32,885
That's what I'm sorry about.

1189
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:36,548
- Seems to meet you

1190
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:39,890
He seems to like you.

1191
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:42,893
- How do you know?

1192
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:45,924
- Am I right?

1193
01:36:47,034 --> 01:36:49,434
But I'm sure I like him.

1194
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:53,939
Had he been speaking to me,

1195
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:56,937
- Passing letters, etc..

1196
01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:00,878
Do you have to hug to say this?

1197
01:37:01,382 --> 01:37:02,872
As good as my brother must feel.

1198
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:07,283
- Aren't you going to the bank?

1199
01:37:10,024 --> 01:37:12,254
What did I come for and

1200
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:15,894
- You got tamarind?

1201
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:18,896
Do you feel like eating tamarind??

1202
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:23,333
Not me, my co-sister.

1203
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:26,268
Really? I'll just get it.

1204
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:28,869
Aunt, listen..!

1205
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,278
- What? - Yes. - Come on!

1206
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:39,879
Aunt Leela...

1207
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:44,289
What is this? You're smoking a bidi!

1208
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:47,687
How many times did I tell you

1209
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,394
- Meaning..?

1210
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:53,159
For the past 2 days

1211
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:56,434
It's so strange.

1212
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:00,974
- Really? - Yes, I just

1213
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:06,378
I'm trying but can't stop.

1214
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:08,971
Isn't that true, husband dear?

1215
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:12,384
God knows what she's

1216
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:17,119
Thank God it's just smoking

1217
01:38:17,858 --> 01:38:21,089
It's thanks to Baba

1218
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:25,828
Niranjan Baba's mango bore fruit.

1219
01:38:27,468 --> 01:38:30,767
Why are you laughing?

1220
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,040
Don't let her work too much.

1221
01:38:36,477 --> 01:38:39,708
Let me know if you need help.

1222
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:43,712
There's been no pregnancy

1223
01:43:25,766 --> 01:43:27,666
Can you pass last year's file?

1224
01:43:28,769 --> 01:43:30,930
Last year's file..is this it?

1225
01:43:31,772 --> 01:43:33,069
This..

1226
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:37,676
Hold it...

1227
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:45,274
- Sorry..

1228
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:47,684
In the earlier days Dushyant

1229
01:43:48,822 --> 01:43:50,687
In our case, it was a cockroach.

1230
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:54,389
- Doesn't matter.

1231
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:56,989
Tell that to the cockroach.

1232
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:04,066
- What is this?

1233
01:44:04,771 --> 01:44:07,672
This office has very few roaches.

1234
01:44:15,782 --> 01:44:19,343
- Is Parvati home?

1235
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:24,189
- I'm Kamli.

1236
01:44:37,137 --> 01:44:39,367
Terrific! Done this too?

1237
01:44:39,573 --> 01:44:40,972
Softly. Somebody might hear.

1238
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:44,476
- How did you come here?

1239
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,480
- For what?

1240
01:44:49,049 --> 01:44:52,485
He sent me to see one of them.

1241
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:54,477
What's wrong in that?

1242
01:44:54,955 --> 01:44:58,516
- That's the best.

1243
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:01,450
- Your play is gone.

1244
01:45:01,828 --> 01:45:04,456
I mean to the Dadu-Mamu theater.

1245
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:08,125
They liked it a lot.

1246
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:12,129
They're putting it up

1247
01:45:12,572 --> 01:45:14,972
I never thought this day would dawn!

1248
01:45:15,575 --> 01:45:21,480
It's thanks to you. I found my path

1249
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:24,413
Now is my prince happy?

1250
01:45:25,552 --> 01:45:27,918
Where shall I put you?

1251
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:31,115
- And what do I do?

1252
01:45:31,558 --> 01:45:33,924
Pregnant women mustn't carry
weights

1253
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:35,789
That's true.

1254
01:45:40,801 --> 01:45:44,362
- Why are you so scared?

1255
01:45:44,805 --> 01:45:47,706
he threatened to break my bones.

1256
01:45:48,308 --> 01:45:51,038
Said, he'll come with 4 hoods.

1257
01:45:51,812 --> 01:45:55,373
- Don't worry. - What will

1258
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,318
Just me, these 2 girls

1259
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:02,651
I am afraid. Can't you stay?

1260
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:07,157
We can. Shantanu was

1261
01:46:07,794 --> 01:46:09,694
- And Sudhir too...

1262
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:13,189
Did I say Sudhir?

1263
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:17,702
I meant to say Sudha is here,

1264
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:23,640
Why don't you send a letter

1265
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:29,645
Sudha will take the letter

1266
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:33,043
I'm Dhananjay Mane's friend.

1267
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:35,152
PIease have a seat.

1268
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:41,192
Unwell..what is wrong with him?

1269
01:46:41,795 --> 01:46:44,696
- That's not yet confirmed.

1270
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:47,699
- Fever...

1271
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:50,103
- Is it high?

1272
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:54,103
- That's very high.

1273
01:46:54,808 --> 01:46:59,108
He won't stop coughing.

1274
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:02,646
His stomach and head hurts.

1275
01:47:03,784 --> 01:47:06,309
That's sad but how did he

1276
01:47:07,788 --> 01:47:11,019
- He's not serious. Doctor said so

1277
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:14,352
You don't worry. We'll set

1278
01:47:15,796 --> 01:47:17,696
- That's what the doctor said.

1279
01:47:18,799 --> 01:47:21,700
I won't feel at ease.

1280
01:47:22,135 --> 01:47:24,968
Nobody must go near Dhananjay.

1281
01:47:28,341 --> 01:47:29,638
Good day.

1282
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:37,675
The day got wasted.

1283
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:40,676
- My leave too was wasted.

1284
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:44,521
- I'd have thrashed him.

1285
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,560
Leelabai made him knit wool.

1286
01:47:51,164 --> 01:47:52,461
Parsha knitting!!

1287
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:56,727
Two knit, two purl..

1288
01:48:00,106 --> 01:48:04,668
Give it up. Dhananjay Mane

1289
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,742
Is this Leelabai's bungalow?

1290
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:16,020
- Do you want to meet her?

1291
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:19,523
- Yes.

1292
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,993
- And you are..?

1293
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:26,989
I see. Let me show you his room.

1294
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:31,002
Point out the room and I'll go

1295
01:48:31,438 --> 01:48:33,497
It's the first time.. you've come

1296
01:48:34,107 --> 01:48:36,507
- Let me show you.

1297
01:48:38,111 --> 01:48:43,014
Welcome. Who will welcome

1298
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:48,519
- What does that mean?

1299
01:48:49,155 --> 01:48:51,521
- I don't understand..

1300
01:48:52,158 --> 01:48:55,389
He's my husband.

1301
01:49:08,942 --> 01:49:10,500
Madam, listen to me!

1302
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:13,173
You are mistaken..

1303
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:17,849
- What is wrong?

1304
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:21,843
- Who was she?

1305
01:49:22,656 --> 01:49:26,114
I'd Iied that I wasn't

1306
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:33,491
My cassette had terrific sales!

1307
01:49:33,934 --> 01:49:35,834
Venus Company gave me an

1308
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:41,499
This is my first success,

1309
01:49:41,942 --> 01:49:44,843
- The other remains.

1310
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:46,845
- Shall I tell you?

1311
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,838
To be a music director.

1312
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:54,352
- What's the matter?

1313
01:49:56,990 --> 01:50:00,551
This..? You are right but

1314
01:50:00,994 --> 01:50:03,895
When will you come home?

1315
01:50:04,497 --> 01:50:07,398
I did tell her but she said

1316
01:50:08,001 --> 01:50:10,902
- I'll come whenever you say.

1317
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,505
I have some work. I'II come tomorrow

1318
01:50:14,407 --> 01:50:17,240
But my sister shouldn't be

1319
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:20,639
I'II send her out with

1320
01:50:21,348 --> 01:50:23,908
- Is that all right?

1321
01:50:26,653 --> 01:50:28,518
- Go fast.

1322
01:50:35,662 --> 01:50:38,392
She's come for me.

1323
01:50:45,105 --> 01:50:47,005
- Will you come shopping with me?

1324
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,409
- We'll be back in an hour or so.

1325
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:53,611
- Take Manisha.

1326
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:56,014
but she has to remain here.

1327
01:50:56,449 --> 01:50:59,418
- Please come with me..

1328
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:03,346
I'm feeling little low and

1329
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:05,955
This medicine puts me

1330
01:51:06,526 --> 01:51:08,994
Few hours..? No problem.

1331
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:11,987
I just took the medicine.

1332
01:51:13,099 --> 01:51:15,659
Then it's not right to ask

1333
01:51:22,108 --> 01:51:23,666
What are you up to?

1334
01:51:25,445 --> 01:51:29,347
Nothing. Sudhir is going to

1335
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:31,950
And Sudha will sleep here for 2
hours

1336
01:51:32,419 --> 01:51:33,943
- How is that possible?

1337
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:42,494
Like this..you wear this, cover

1338
01:51:43,096 --> 01:51:47,328
- Why punish me?

1339
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:49,659
Parsha and I have been

1340
01:51:50,103 --> 01:51:54,005
- But why me..?

1341
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:57,008
they should feel

1342
01:51:58,445 --> 01:52:01,937
You know everything

1343
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:07,212
Goodness! What if

1344
01:52:09,089 --> 01:52:10,613
I'II sit in her room.

1345
01:52:11,424 --> 01:52:14,257
If she wakes up, I'II

1346
01:52:15,095 --> 01:52:18,292
- Will that do? - Yes but don't let

1347
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:37,648
Welcome..

1348
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:40,479
- Is Sudha home?

1349
01:52:41,287 --> 01:52:43,152
Come on, aunt has been waiting.

1350
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:46,588
Weren't you waiting?

1351
01:52:52,632 --> 01:52:53,860
Sudha, keep sleeping.

1352
01:52:55,301 --> 01:52:57,861
What's the matter?

1353
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:02,640
- Are you legs aching?

1354
01:53:03,243 --> 01:53:08,613
I'II press your Iegs

1355
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:17,154
You're so brave.

1356
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:24,525
what's wrong? Why are you
shivering?

1357
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:26,856
Can't sleep..?

1358
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:30,201
Turn over. You might feel better.

1359
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:32,203
Let me turn you over.

1360
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,206
- No..!

1361
01:53:35,975 --> 01:53:38,466
I'm not wearing a saree.

1362
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:43,805
Very well, you sleep.

1363
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:48,218
I agree but I don't

1364
01:53:48,755 --> 01:53:51,724
Whatever it be, she's

1365
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:53,723
I've told him so many times.

1366
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:57,261
I'II write to Manisha's parents.

1367
01:53:58,031 --> 01:53:59,931
They won't refuse my proposal.

1368
01:54:01,301 --> 01:54:04,862
You make up with Sudha.

1369
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:07,705
- She's gone out.

1370
01:54:08,308 --> 01:54:11,937
We'll get them together

1371
01:54:12,645 --> 01:54:16,206
Yes. I must now take leave.

1372
01:54:16,649 --> 01:54:18,549
- I'll see him off.

1373
01:54:29,028 --> 01:54:30,928
I haven't called you.

1374
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:34,329
- I want to talk to you.

1375
01:54:35,034 --> 01:54:37,935
- Never. Get out!

1376
01:54:39,038 --> 01:54:41,598
I can understand your anger.

1377
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:45,204
I'm quitting the job and

1378
01:54:46,446 --> 01:54:50,542
But I want to say even in

1379
01:54:53,586 --> 01:54:56,612
But now it's all over.

1380
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:59,388
Read this letter.

1381
01:55:00,026 --> 01:55:01,926
It's my last wish.

1382
01:55:13,339 --> 01:55:14,499
Stop.

1383
01:55:17,343 --> 01:55:20,642
I have to talk to you.

1384
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:24,180
Like you always talk
? Go ahead.

1385
01:55:25,318 --> 01:55:28,685
Why did you deceive me?

1386
01:55:30,323 --> 01:55:32,621
Did you think of how I must feel?

1387
01:55:34,327 --> 01:55:37,626
I was so disappointed!

1388
01:55:39,332 --> 01:55:43,632
Why didn't you say this earlier?

1389
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:46,896
Why..?

1390
01:55:49,342 --> 01:55:51,242
As if you told me earlier?

1391
01:55:55,348 --> 01:55:59,250
- Does everything have to be said?

1392
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:03,188
As if you understood

1393
01:56:05,325 --> 01:56:06,883
But your love was powerful

1394
01:56:07,327 --> 01:56:10,228
Reprimand on the lips

1395
01:56:12,332 --> 01:56:14,732
- But madam...

1396
01:56:16,336 --> 01:56:17,735
Only call me Madhuri.

1397
01:56:23,676 --> 01:56:26,167
Brother..aunt, where's everyone?

1398
01:56:26,746 --> 01:56:28,179
I'll tell you but why are you

1399
01:56:28,781 --> 01:56:30,772
I cleared the Doctor's exam!

1400
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:35,685
- But where's everyone?

1401
01:56:36,322 --> 01:56:39,189
Manisha has gone to see Sudhir

1402
01:56:39,726 --> 01:56:43,218
Sudha is still at the bank.

1403
01:56:48,334 --> 01:56:50,234
I passed! I've become a doctor!

1404
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:53,230
- Congratulations.

1405
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,638
- Yes, I am.

1406
01:56:57,343 --> 01:56:59,243
Put this aside and come with me.

1407
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:02,509
- Don't bother me..

1408
02:03:23,496 --> 02:03:24,656
Congratulations.

1409
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:27,056
You've become a Doctor!

1410
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:30,401
Wish you the same because

1411
02:03:31,504 --> 02:03:33,734
- I feel bad about one thing.

1412
02:03:34,507 --> 02:03:35,872
Brother only got Madhuri.

1413
02:03:36,842 --> 02:03:39,402
He'll own the store

1414
02:03:40,513 --> 02:03:41,878
That is true.

1415
02:03:43,516 --> 02:03:45,416
Brother!

1416
02:03:46,552 --> 02:03:48,417
- You know? - I knew

1417
02:03:49,555 --> 02:03:52,422
That's why I got these sweets.

1418
02:03:55,561 --> 02:03:56,858
Always be successful.

1419
02:03:57,563 --> 02:03:59,861
I have another joyous news.

1420
02:04:04,069 --> 02:04:07,300
Madhuri's contact has

1421
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:10,470
Great! Let's run away from here.

1422
02:04:11,076 --> 02:04:12,475
- That's a big problem.

1423
02:04:13,078 --> 02:04:14,978
- How do we leave?

1424
02:04:15,481 --> 02:04:18,382
It's going to be difficult

1425
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:20,983
That's true.

1426
02:04:22,121 --> 02:04:24,351
Shantanu has already said

1427
02:04:24,657 --> 02:04:27,592
- We'll worsen it.

1428
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:29,925
We have to admit her immediately.

1429
02:04:30,563 --> 02:04:32,622
And Parvati has gone home

1430
02:04:33,065 --> 02:04:34,464
And some thing terrible happens to

1431
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:36,398
To Parvati not you.

1432
02:04:37,069 --> 02:04:41,472
- What? - I myself saw

1433
02:04:42,074 --> 02:04:45,976
And I saw Sudha jump out of window

1434
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:49,639
I see. Now they're in trouble.

1435
02:04:50,416 --> 02:04:52,384
I'II teach them a Iesson!

1436
02:04:57,122 --> 02:04:59,488
- When did this happen?

1437
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:02,687
Shantanu gave her water

1438
02:05:03,329 --> 02:05:05,627
so I'm feeding her with a spoon.

1439
02:05:07,066 --> 02:05:10,467
She's in such bad state.

1440
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:12,970
Shantanu has gone.

1441
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:18,475
Who is the patient?

1442
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:21,478
The doctor won't hurt you.

1443
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:28,914
Go slow.

1444
02:05:31,056 --> 02:05:33,217
- Hurry up.

1445
02:05:37,062 --> 02:05:38,290
Doctor, what's wrong?

1446
02:05:40,065 --> 02:05:41,293
Come with me.

1447
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:47,962
She is sinking. Admit her

1448
02:06:01,053 --> 02:06:05,922
- What is it? - I know

1449
02:06:07,059 --> 02:06:09,357
- Don't talk foolishly.

1450
02:06:11,063 --> 02:06:13,691
Fulfill my last wish..

1451
02:06:15,067 --> 02:06:18,969
I want to die in my

1452
02:06:20,072 --> 02:06:25,408
- Brother.. - Very well,

1453
02:06:27,012 --> 02:06:29,572
- We'll take you there.

1454
02:06:30,015 --> 02:06:32,245
- Shall I go?

1455
02:06:32,518 --> 02:06:34,577
I meant sister-in-Iaw..

1456
02:06:35,054 --> 02:06:38,421
- What?

1457
02:06:39,558 --> 02:06:42,925
I'll be reborn in your womb.

1458
02:06:44,063 --> 02:06:45,963
There are only rags in my stomach.

1459
02:06:46,465 --> 02:06:49,957
Sure, I'll look forward to it.

1460
02:06:51,070 --> 02:06:53,300
Let her rest. Brother,

1461
02:06:54,073 --> 02:06:56,633
We'll call for it.

1462
02:07:03,415 --> 02:07:05,906
Did I really look like I'm dying?

1463
02:07:07,052 --> 02:07:09,282
- Now I'll be dying..

1464
02:07:09,655 --> 02:07:10,952
I have to pay for the ambulance.

1465
02:07:13,058 --> 02:07:15,618
Why are you carrying this?

1466
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:24,297
- Come on. - I'm ready.

1467
02:07:25,004 --> 02:07:27,905
Cover yourself. You hold

1468
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:31,901
- On my shoulders! - Butchers!

1469
02:07:33,012 --> 02:07:34,479
shoulder!

1470
02:07:37,016 --> 02:07:39,917
the weight. I know this.

1471
02:07:41,053 --> 02:07:42,418
Go to sleep!

1472
02:08:35,007 --> 02:08:36,406
Let me see what I see..

1473
02:08:41,013 --> 02:08:42,412
I said, let go!

1474
02:09:26,992 --> 02:09:28,857
Let go!

1475
02:09:38,003 --> 02:09:40,904
Damn good!

1476
02:09:43,008 --> 02:09:44,373
You hit me!!

1477
02:09:54,052 --> 02:09:57,419
- Come here. What's wrong?

1478
02:09:57,723 --> 02:10:01,352
Crying like a girl..

1479
02:10:26,051 --> 02:10:27,916
Leave them, they're girls.

1480
02:10:32,558 --> 02:10:35,618
- Beating a pregnant woman..

1481
02:10:48,073 --> 02:10:49,472
Gone case!

1482
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:12,958
The sight scared him!

1483
02:11:40,392 --> 02:11:43,259
- lnspector, these are the men!

1484
02:11:44,396 --> 02:11:48,298
Like a chicken you were

1485
02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:50,801
You cursed me though

1486
02:11:51,403 --> 02:11:53,633
And you got taken in by them!

1487
02:11:54,406 --> 02:11:56,897
Such crooks do anything for money!

1488
02:11:58,410 --> 02:12:00,241
These demons would have killed you!

1489
02:12:00,779 --> 02:12:03,907
They would have ruined the house.

1490
02:12:04,349 --> 02:12:05,748
But I didn't let that happen.

1491
02:12:06,351 --> 02:12:09,912
Forget about wiping your feet,

1492
02:12:10,389 --> 02:12:11,754
You snag their praise!

1493
02:12:12,391 --> 02:12:15,758
Speaking the truth

1494
02:12:16,395 --> 02:12:19,296
If I had my way, l'd

1495
02:12:20,065 --> 02:12:22,625
Aunt, ultimately your

1496
02:12:23,402 --> 02:12:26,235
Always remember that.

1497
02:12:26,672 --> 02:12:29,232
Break their bones and

1498
02:12:31,343 --> 02:12:33,641
Dhania, are you happy?

1499
02:12:33,946 --> 02:12:37,245
I didn't think your drama

1500
02:12:37,516 --> 02:12:38,915
But that's not his fault.

1501
02:12:39,351 --> 02:12:40,750
- Whose idea was it?

1502
02:12:41,386 --> 02:12:44,253
Shut up and find a way out of this

1503
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:46,758
Only one way.

1504
02:12:47,059 --> 02:12:48,287
- And then to jail.

1505
02:12:49,394 --> 02:12:51,259
Aunt, this is the time to

1506
02:12:51,797 --> 02:12:53,958
Tell the cops they stole

1507
02:12:54,399 --> 02:12:55,798
Let them go to jail.

1508
02:12:56,401 --> 02:12:58,301
You be quiet. I'll see to it.

1509
02:13:02,341 --> 02:13:04,639
- Good day sir.

1510
02:13:05,744 --> 02:13:08,235
I want to talk to the men

1511
02:13:09,348 --> 02:13:10,747
Ganpat, get those 4 guys.

1512
02:13:11,083 --> 02:13:14,246
Aunt, tell him about the theft.

1513
02:13:19,391 --> 02:13:20,756
Come here.

1514
02:13:31,203 --> 02:13:33,364
How much I trusted you.

1515
02:13:33,872 --> 02:13:35,772
I treated you as family.

1516
02:13:36,208 --> 02:13:38,108
I loved you like a mother.

1517
02:13:39,211 --> 02:13:43,113
And you..took advantage

1518
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:48,110
We admit we took advantage

1519
02:13:48,653 --> 02:13:50,120
but we didn't harm you.

1520
02:13:51,256 --> 02:13:54,487
Let me say this, we

1521
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:57,125
You said you'd give the

1522
02:13:58,263 --> 02:14:00,424
We couldn't live without a roof.

1523
02:14:01,199 --> 02:14:05,101
We didn't deceive you.

1524
02:14:06,204 --> 02:14:10,106
Anyway, we have to bear

1525
02:14:10,609 --> 02:14:14,101
But we didn't know our drama

1526
02:14:15,213 --> 02:14:16,771
This is our worst punishment.

1527
02:14:18,817 --> 02:14:23,151
We have no right to ask for

1528
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:26,087
but we'll never forget

1529
02:14:26,525 --> 02:14:29,551
Don't listen to them!

1530
02:14:31,196 --> 02:14:34,495
Inspector, they haven't

1531
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:37,429
In fact, they helped me.

1532
02:14:38,203 --> 02:14:42,367
- I have no complains against them

1533
02:14:43,208 --> 02:14:44,607
They are robbers, thieves, crooks!

1534
02:14:44,876 --> 02:14:46,104
You're saying this?

1535
02:14:46,545 --> 02:14:50,606
Ingrate! Asking for an advance

1536
02:14:51,216 --> 02:14:52,513
You're calling them crooks!

1537
02:14:56,588 --> 02:14:58,522
Relations can be of blood.

1538
02:14:59,257 --> 02:15:01,555
But love weaves a permanent bond.

1539
02:15:02,194 --> 02:15:03,752
Which they spun.

1540
02:15:05,197 --> 02:15:08,428
If I had children and

1541
02:15:09,201 --> 02:15:10,759
would I have sent them to prison?

1542
02:15:14,206 --> 02:15:16,106
Inspector, these men are good.

1543
02:15:17,209 --> 02:15:19,769
They did this for the house.

1544
02:15:21,713 --> 02:15:23,840
Let's go home, children.

1545
02:15:26,151 --> 02:15:27,550
Aunt..

1546
02:15:29,187 --> 02:15:31,052
Aunt, your favour..

1547
02:15:33,191 --> 02:15:34,419
Get up.

1548
02:15:36,194 --> 02:15:40,426
If you talk of favours,

1549
02:15:42,534 --> 02:15:45,765
It is said, everything

1550
02:15:46,204 --> 02:15:50,538
To add to it, everything

1551
02:15:52,611 --> 02:15:56,240
You're free from jail

1552
02:15:57,916 --> 02:15:59,144
What punishment?
