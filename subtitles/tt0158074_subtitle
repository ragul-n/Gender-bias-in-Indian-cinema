1
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,111
Aren't you ashamed of begging?
You're an able woman!

2
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,550
How can you beg?! Get lost!
And fiind something to do.

3
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:00,450
Wait...

4
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:06,328
Maybe you don't like what I said?
But what I said is right.

5
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,329
For someone who is able-bodied,
begging is a very worst thing.

6
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:15,604
One loses esteem, one turns into
a parasite, a useless non-entity.

7
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:19,239
You are able. You should work.

8
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:23,943
Sure, I should. And I know that.

9
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:29,820
Then why don't you work?
- I wanted to. And I have tried.

10
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:35,060
Work apart, there is another
quid pro quo that men seek.

11
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:40,396
Not all men are alike.
If you want to work for a living...

12
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,300
I can offer you something.
I'm giving you a friend's address.

13
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:49,101
He'll put you on to something.
Get over to him tomorrow morning.

14
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:53,547
And start working.
Don't beg.

15
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:18,434
Radha, is it you, my child?
Did you fiind something?

16
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:24,274
Nothing, Daddy. But how are you?
- I'm not worried for myself.

17
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:28,543
It's the tomorrow that worries me.
- Why?

18
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:32,018
Bhikhu came here again, saying
that unless we pay up...

19
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:36,784
the arrears of the rent by tomorrow,
he's going to throw us out.

20
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:42,997
What's to happen now, Daddy?
Where are we going to go?

21
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:47,295
For someone with nowhere to go,
the world is a very small place.

22
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:53,471
But not be afraid, dear.
If he drives us out...

23
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,578
we'll go and park ourselves
under a tree.

24
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:58,942
At least no one will be able
to edge us out of there.

25
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:06,317
Daddy, someone gave me an address.
He said I could fiind work there.

26
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:13,225
But I threw the chit away.
- Why did you do that?

27
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:17,423
Who knows, it could have led us
to better times.

28
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,932
Let me go and look for it right now.
- Not at this time of the night.

29
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:28,509
Times are bad. It isn't safe.
- Don't worry. I'll be right back.

30
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:13,116
Looking for something?
-A piece of paper.

31
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:17,115
Paper?
- There's someone's address on it.

32
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,557
Address? Whose?
-A prospective employer.

33
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,129
Someone gave me the address.
- Really?

34
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:26,792
My father is sick. He can't work.
We haven't paid the rent for months.

35
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:29,426
If I can't fiind a job,
we're going to be homeless.

36
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:31,266
I must fiind the address!

37
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:40,771
Could it be this one?

38
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:45,417
Yes! Thanks!

39
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,191
Did you call me, sir?
- Yes. Look, I've asked a girl...

40
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:02,566
to see you. Give her a job.
- Sure.

41
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:07,004
I told her that I was referring her
to a friend of mine.

42
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:08,302
She shouldn't come to know
that I own this mill.

43
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,569
Fine.
- Put her on daily wages.

44
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:18,444
Name?
- Radha.

45
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:23,150
Age?
- i9.

46
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:26,257
Address?
-Address...

47
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:30,256
Mr Manohar Das'Hutments.
At Gol Park.

48
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:35,266
Husband's name?
- I'm not married.

49
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,200
Not married yet?
- No.

50
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:40,036
Your father's name?
- Sadhuram.

51
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:45,074
What does he do?
- Nothing.

52
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,272
He's unemployed?
- Yes.

53
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:52,614
He's sick. He can't work.
- Not to worry.

54
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:55,446
Come on. I'll show you
your workplace.

55
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:03,597
Daddy! I found a job!
I got paid one whole rupee!

56
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:07,394
And I went shopping! Look!
I'll cook for you tonight!

57
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:10,471
The kitchen fiire will burn!
After so many days!

58
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,698
Daddy! Why are you so quiet?

59
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:16,567
Uncle Bhikhu!

60
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:23,247
Have you come here to throw us out?
- No! To give you this house for good!

61
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,444
I wanted to throw your luggage out
the fiirst thing this morning.

62
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:30,080
But this poor old man, you know.
So I thought I'd wait for you.

63
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:34,252
We'll pay you every penny!
I have a job now!

64
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:38,196
Some big fat contract, is it?
At one rupee a day...

65
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,666
what will you feed yourself?
And how will you pay me?

66
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:44,795
I'll work harder. I'll make more!
And I'll save every penny!

67
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,435
What'd your pennies add up to?
Old man hasn't paid me in 3 years!

68
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:54,276
Know how much that is? i300!
- I'll pay you every penny!

69
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,874
Just give me some time!
- No more time!

70
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,613
I got the courts to stay the eviction
just because you said so.

71
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:03,121
But you haven't even paid up
a single installment!

72
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:07,092
The landlord is going to court
asking for a liquidation!

73
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:12,827
I'll go to the landlord,
and I'll beg of him!

74
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:16,460
All I'd ask him for is a bit of time.
He can spare a bit of time, can't he?

75
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:24,171
Can't he?! Of course he can!
He could write off the debt.

76
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:27,042
He could even give you this hovel!
But make sure you do...

77
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:29,515
whatever needs to be done,
today itself!.

78
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,313
No tomorrows, you know...

79
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:37,483
You...?

80
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:41,426
May I come in?
- Welcome.

81
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:48,196
But how did you get this address?
- My friend. He told me.

82
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:52,131
I asked him about your job.
- I got the job!

83
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:54,401
Your friend is a very nice man.
- Very nice man!

84
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,339
And I got paid today!

85
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:05,510
He's the one who gave me the address.
- You have done us a great favour!

86
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:08,347
Please, do not...
- Please be seated.

87
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:15,052
Friend of yours, is a very nice man.
-An old friend.

88
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:18,563
He said that once I'm trained,
I'll get a raise.

89
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:22,160
Why not? If you work hard enough,
I'll see to it that...

90
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:25,000
I mean my friend... he will
take care of everything.

91
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,509
But make sure you put
your heart in it.

92
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,210
Well, excuse me now.

93
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:40,551
May God be with you.

94
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:43,584
Wait...

95
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:58,531
How can I ever thank you for
what you have done for me...?

96
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:02,740
I have nothing else but this...

97
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:16,554
Give it to your father.
That'd make me happy.

98
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:16,548
I made 20 rupees today!

99
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:19,677
How are you today, Daddy?
- Fine!

100
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,971
Hello!

101
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,171
Coming from work?
- Yes.

102
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:51,479
Radha, I'd like to take you out.
- Take me out...?

103
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:53,314
To see my mother.

104
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,313
But I have to cook
for my father.

105
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,824
That's taken care of.
I just met him.

106
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,793
How can I go without telling him?
- I have told him.

107
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,128
Still, I must take his permission.
- Very well. Go on.

108
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:16,201
Daddy, that gentleman... the one
who was here the other day...

109
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:22,542
Nirmal. That's his name.
He left a moment ago.

110
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:26,279
He brought all this for me.
And you know what?

111
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:31,620
He even sat down to eat with me!
- I met him on my way here.

112
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:38,496
He was telling me that he wants
to take me to see his mother.

113
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:40,931
He told me that too. He might
be considering you for a job!

114
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:46,099
As his mother's maidservant...?
- Should I go then?

115
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,972
Yes, but be back early.
- Sure.

116
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:58,541
Mummy...

117
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:01,581
Come inside... come.

118
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:12,455
Mummy

119
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,998
Mummy... anybody home?
- Yes sir?

120
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,265
Where's my mother?
- She has gone out.

121
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,505
What are you doing over there?
Come inside.

122
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:35,679
You live here...?
- Yes.

123
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:39,456
Is this your house?
- Yes, my house. Why?

124
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:41,289
No, it's nothing.
- Sit down.

125
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:43,260
My mother has gone out.
She will be back soon.

126
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:46,665
I'll come another time.
- No! Today. We do it today.

127
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:49,534
Sit down. That's meant
for sitting.

128
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:55,438
Radha, there are kinds and
kinds of people who sit on it.

129
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:58,444
You're better than most of them.

130
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:05,315
I think I should be leaving.
- I think you should live here.

131
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:08,115
Here...? In this house?
- Yes.

132
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:12,192
You want me to give up my job?
- You will have to.

133
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:17,264
But I have never worked
in such a big house!

134
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:20,923
Who's asking you to work?
- What else am I supposed to do?

135
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:25,268
You're silly. Don't you even
understand as much?

136
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:33,571
Nirmal is about to proposition
Radha.

137
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:38,276
So what do you say?
Yes? Or no?

138
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:45,685
All I seek is to serve you!

139
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:16,961
Daddy, I...

140
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,294
No! He...!

141
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:27,313
Look at her dancing away
to gay abandon!

142
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:29,847
Uncle Bhikhu!

143
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:33,010
Don't you call me uncle!
I'm nobody's uncle!

144
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:38,319
And I'm not listening to you!
You said you'd go to see the landlord.

145
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:41,326
You said you'd beg of him!
You said you'd pay up everything!

146
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:43,862
You haven't done anything!

147
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:46,592
Why are you fellows waiting for?
Throw out their stuff.

148
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,497
No!
- What do you mean?!

149
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:53,335
Can't you ask Mr Nirmal to help us?

150
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:57,171
Nirmal?! Oh no! That can't be done!

151
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,336
What'd he think?

152
00:20:00,414 --> 00:20:03,281
Uncle Bhikhu, please give
my Daddy a day's time.

153
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,478
Tomorrow...
- No way!

154
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,386
The boss wants you
thrown out today!

155
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:15,087
Go on, then!
Throw me out too!

156
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,094
No, Daddy!

157
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:24,663
No one throws you out
as long as I'm alive.

158
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:28,434
I'll go and see the landlord
right away.

159
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:31,568
Wait for me. I'm coming
with you too.

160
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:38,616
Yes boss. I tried to dissuade her.
But she insists on seeing you.

161
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:44,321
Very well, sir.

162
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,120
All right, you can see him.

163
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:52,591
But the door is closed.
- It'll open up.

164
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,061
What do you want?

165
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:02,440
Mercy! Bhikhu is throwing us out!

166
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:06,877
My father is very sick!
Please do not evict us!

167
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:10,541
I'll pay you up very soon!
Have mercy on us, sir!

168
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:13,453
So beautiful!

169
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,282
What's your name?

170
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:20,553
Radha.

171
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:23,625
Father's name?

172
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:26,293
Sadhuram.

173
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,300
i50 rupees.
- I'll pay up every penny!

174
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,308
Please give me some more time!
Have mercy on us!

175
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:39,413
I am very good at heart.

176
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:42,511
I can't bear to see anyone unhappy.

177
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:48,184
When I see people in need of money,
I throw my coffers open.

178
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:53,589
When I see you homeless,
I give you my rooms.

179
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:58,956
But when I ask for rent,
what do I get in return?

180
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:05,061
Lame excuses and false promises.
- It isn't that.

181
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:07,606
My father has been bed-ridden
for two years.

182
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:11,473
That's why he couldn't pay you.
But now I have a job.

183
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:15,571
I'll pay up everything I owe you.
But please give me some time.

184
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:22,113
Please don't throw us out!
It'd kill my father!

185
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:26,818
And I have no one else!
Please! Have mercy on me!

186
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm moved!

187
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:42,974
I might give you more time.

188
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:48,309
I might even decide
to write the debt off.

189
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:51,646
I shall never forget
your kindness!

190
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:59,083
But on one condition.
- How may I be of service, sir?!

191
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,994
You are exquisite!

192
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:17,406
Let me go!

193
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:21,276
For God's sake! Open the door!
I beg of you! Let me go!

194
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:25,579
What's your hurry?

195
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,547
Come...
- Leave me!

196
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:32,458
Let go!

197
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:42,392
Do you think you can run from me?

198
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,506
Don't come near me!
I'll kill you!

199
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:04,413
What took you so long, Radha?
I was worried.

200
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:06,610
What did the landlord say?

201
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:10,114
What happened, Radha?

202
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:14,117
I knew this!

203
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:19,028
You expected the landlord
to be kind to you?

204
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:25,196
Oh no! These monied men
are stone-hearted!

205
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:29,274
You had to go to him
just because of me!

206
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:35,076
It's God's doing! Why else would He
put me in bed for two years?

207
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:39,277
But don't worry, dear. We'll fiind
ourselves a tree or something.

208
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:45,415
You aren't going to need any tree.
Not as long as the boss is alive.

209
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:50,292
What do you take him for?
He has written your debt off.

210
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:55,234
The boss was kind to her.
You should thank him for that.

211
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:00,705
He asked me not to bother you.
So, enjoy yourselves!

212
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:09,982
Heard that? The landlord has written
the debt off!.He was kind to you!

213
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:17,456
God! You have taken notice of us!
You are kind, Lord!

214
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,472
What's up?!

215
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,940
You're crying!

216
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:51,083
What's the matter?
Tell me, what happened?

217
00:27:54,254 --> 00:27:56,119
What's happened to you?!

218
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:58,156
You don't go to work!
You don't even stay at home.

219
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:01,022
Your father says, you go out every
morning! Where have you been going?

220
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:06,299
Why don't you speak?
Where have you been going?

221
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:10,093
Why don't you answer me?

222
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:15,235
Where are you going?
- Leave me!

223
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:18,311
Let me go!
- No!

224
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:22,309
I'm not letting you go till you've
told me what's happening to you...?

225
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:26,383
What's come over you?
Are you forgetting everything?!

226
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,958
Radha! I want to do so much for you!
- I want nothing!

227
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:34,652
Nothing!

228
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:43,526
Radha, what's happening to you?

229
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,951
Don't worry. Everything
is going to be all right.

230
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:01,680
Make sure you eat well.
And take some exercise.

231
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,354
Don't you worry.
She isn't sick.

232
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:08,292
She's with baby.
- Baby?!

233
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:12,298
Don't worry. I will take care of
everything. Call me if you need me.

234
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:19,603
Radha, did you hear
what the midwife said?

235
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:29,573
Is this true?! Nirmal! Is he the one?!
He feigned the sympathy!

236
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,314
Then who is it?!
Tell me, Radha!

237
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:38,916
Why don't you speak?!

238
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:41,391
Tell me who the rascal is!

239
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:42,995
Speak up, Radha!

240
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:53,330
i50 rupees is a lot of money
for a poor girl, Daddy.

241
00:29:56,477 --> 00:30:00,607
Kill me, Daddy! Kill me!
I can't take this any longer!

242
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:22,435
Do you hear, God? Do you hear
my little girl scream?!

243
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:26,300
Our God! The refuge of
the poor and the burdened!

244
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,967
Where were you when it happened
to my daughter?!

245
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:34,980
You saw it happen to my daughter!
And yet you are the God!

246
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:40,315
My world plunges into darkness!
Thy kingdom come!

247
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:47,592
What sin was she punished for?
Did she go against you?

248
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:52,321
But thy will is done, on earth!

249
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,762
My daughter has been brought
to dishonor!

250
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:57,666
Are you not shamed?!

251
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:03,542
No use crying. Our blind God
has now turned deaf!.

252
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:06,473
Our cries go unheard.

253
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:14,218
You think I'm a cripple?
You think I'll take it lying?!

254
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:18,222
Never! I will not tolerate
your crimes! Never!

255
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:24,122
Poor, we might be.
But we don't sell our women!

256
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:28,223
I'll kill that devil!
No one on earth can stop me!

257
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:32,361
Not even God!

258
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,565
Daddy!

259
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,919
Stop!

260
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:34,029
Where do you think
you're going?

261
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:37,271
Oh I see!

262
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:43,407
Want to die? That's very easy.
One step, and it's all over!

263
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,781
Dropping dead is easy.
But living, now that's tough.

264
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:49,578
Understand? Oh no, you don't!

265
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:54,153
The easy way out is for fools.

266
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:57,354
The smart ones live,
and they put up a fight.

267
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:02,524
I get it.

268
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:08,641
No food... no home... no clothes.

269
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:12,005
So you want to die.
But just think this over...

270
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:17,105
If all the homeless and the hungry
decided to die, who would be left?

271
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,016
No one else, but me!
Now look at me.

272
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:23,122
What do I have? Nothing.

273
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:27,522
My clothes, borrowed.
My pockets, empty.

274
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:33,328
My stomach, always empty.
But here I am, alive! Happy!

275
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,491
Catch me grumbling?
Never!

276
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:38,131
Understand?

277
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:40,296
No, you don't.
But never mind.

278
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:43,137
Come with me.
- Leave me alone!

279
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:47,872
Please yourself. If you won't
come with me, just come along.

280
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:50,005
Come on.
- But...

281
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:54,146
Oh yes! I understand.
You want to die.

282
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:59,281
But tell me, who wanted to be born
in the fiirst place? No one!

283
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,157
But born we were.
Now, who wants to die?

284
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:07,357
No one! But die we shall!
Surely, and someday. Everyone dies.

285
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,697
What's your hurry?
Did that fellow send you a cable?

286
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,603
Has he written to you, express mail?
Has he been telephoning you? No!

287
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:20,107
You don't gate-crash.
- Go away from here.

288
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:24,307
Who's here to stay? Someday
or the other, everyone leaves.

289
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:27,849
He hasn't cabled me or anything.
So, I can't get going.

290
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:30,479
And you better drop the idea
of going to heaven.

291
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:34,116
Just come home with your brother.

292
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:37,222
Yes, brother.

293
00:38:42,335 --> 00:38:43,324
Move it!

294
00:38:56,549 --> 00:39:00,212
Mast Manor! Mastram's house.

295
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:05,552
It's old. But it's as strong
as the Red Fort in Delhi.

296
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:13,590
Get lost. I have a new guest.

297
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:19,996
That's what you'd call
an understanding guest.

298
00:39:20,073 --> 00:39:21,973
Takes the back-door out.

299
00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:26,303
In this world, the poor are at par
with dogs. Understand?

300
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:29,982
You don't understand, do you?
Never mind, come on in.

301
00:39:32,252 --> 00:39:36,154
Keeps happening all the time,
but never mind.

302
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:44,057
The drawing room in Mast Manor.
Welcome.

303
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:52,532
No! Don't touch that!

304
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:55,197
If that budges, the roof will come
crashing down on the floor...

305
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:59,573
and the floor...
well, where's the floor gone?

306
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:05,444
Don't get it? Neither does she!
Where's the floor?

307
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:08,110
Just come on in.

308
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:24,059
This is Mastram's suite.

309
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:28,937
When I'm hungry, I cook myself
a meal, and I lay the table.

310
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:32,067
Then I sit down to eat.

311
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:35,978
When I feel like sleeping,
I lie down on my bed.

312
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:38,584
When I feel like it,
I just change sides.

313
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:42,415
This house is blessed by The Lord.

314
00:40:42,555 --> 00:40:44,614
Sunshine in the mornings,
moonlight by night...

315
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:47,319
the bounty of rains, and
the pleasure of winter chills!

316
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:50,660
God has been very kind to me!

317
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:58,230
By the way, I forgot
to ask you your name.

318
00:41:00,974 --> 00:41:04,637
You can sit on the bed.

319
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:06,334
Sit down.

320
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,339
Sit!

321
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:21,956
Relax, while I fiix something
for the stomach.

322
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:31,098
You know Radha,
life is all about eating.

323
00:41:31,237 --> 00:41:34,570
From time immemorial
unto the future to come...

324
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:38,108
every war has been fought
on or around the stomach.

325
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:44,979
Strife, attrition, murder and war
are all centered over this terrain.

326
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:49,646
But for this, there would be no
Mastrams and Radhas in this world.

327
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:53,590
But for cause,
would there be effect?

328
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:57,192
No, she doesn't understand.

329
00:42:58,558 --> 00:43:03,621
4 hours! 240 minutes.
For i4,400 seconds...

330
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:09,996
I have been marching up and down.
Why? What for?

331
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:13,499
What for, Mastram?!
Mastram, you're an ass!

332
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:17,402
Ass? Who says I'm an ass?!

333
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:26,951
Called myself an ass, did I?
Takes an ass to call an ass an ass.

334
00:43:33,092 --> 00:43:34,081
The baby!

335
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:53,196
Coming, darling.

336
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:17,591
Who was that crying?

337
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,283
The infant, then the man,
then the old man...

338
00:44:39,353 --> 00:44:42,982
and then the infant again.
The world goes in circles.

339
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:44,285
Don't understand?

340
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:46,292
Give him to me.
. No, you'll drop him.

341
00:44:47,962 --> 00:44:50,192
He loves coming to me.

342
00:44:55,903 --> 00:45:00,272
He's growing fast. At this speed,
he'll become a me. Another Mastram.

343
00:45:02,877 --> 00:45:04,276
What did you ask?

344
00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:08,915
Oh, it's all arranged.
Don't worry.

345
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,917
You're on your way to
another Mast Manor...

346
00:45:11,986 --> 00:45:14,045
much bigger than this mansion.
You'll have it all for yourself.

347
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:19,458
A nursery for you, a playhouse for you
and a playground for you.

348
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:22,257
You're going to live it up.
How about it, sonny?

349
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,661
Are we going somewhere else?
. What did you say?

350
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,462
Are we going somewhere else?

351
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:30,935
Why should we? As long as
l have Mast Manor...

352
00:45:31,005 --> 00:45:34,873
l'm not going anywhere.
Not even to Taj Mahal.

353
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:38,605
We aren't going anywhere.
The prince is going.

354
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,142
Going? Where?

355
00:45:40,214 --> 00:45:43,012
Oh, l forgot to tell you, Radha.

356
00:45:43,151 --> 00:45:47,349
The orphanage is willing
to take him in.

357
00:45:47,488 --> 00:45:49,115
Orphanage?
. Yes.

358
00:45:49,157 --> 00:45:51,648
Why in an orphanage?
He's fine here.

359
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,020
Not at all.

360
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:56,225
lt no good for him to live here.
Nor for you.

361
00:45:56,364 --> 00:46:01,734
No. l won't let you take him away.
lt's my baby. l'm his mother.

362
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:06,235
You don't know how cruel
this world can be.

363
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:09,538
They won't let you and your baby
live like human beings.

364
00:46:09,677 --> 00:46:14,671
At every step, you will be hounded
like stray dogs.

365
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:18,683
Frighten me as much as you will,
l won't give him away.

366
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:24,180
l will toil for his sake.
l can go hungry for his sake.

367
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:26,190
But l can't bear
to give him away.

368
00:46:26,928 --> 00:46:28,657
He's all l have.

369
00:46:37,038 --> 00:46:38,232
Nice thought.

370
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,734
You keep him.
You toil for him.

371
00:46:43,878 --> 00:46:48,508
Beg if you have to, put up
with anything. For his sake.

372
00:46:48,649 --> 00:46:52,949
You'd do everything a mother
would do for her son.

373
00:46:53,087 --> 00:46:58,548
And in time, he grows up.
Do you know what happens then?

374
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:02,094
Someone is going to ask him
who his father is.

375
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,630
What answer has he?
Blank.

376
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:07,463
Then he comes and asks you.
What answer have you?

377
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:08,968
None.

378
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:14,402
Stories aren't told about a mother's
sacrifices or sorrows. Father's name?

379
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:17,672
That question is coming up.
. Shut up. For God's sake, shut up.

380
00:47:17,745 --> 00:47:22,114
You don't know a mother's emotions.
You are a man. Emotions for a man...

381
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:30,012
You imply l'm devoid of emotion?
Emotion? l have none.

382
00:47:30,157 --> 00:47:32,250
All my emotions have been
trampled upon.

383
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:38,791
l am taken for a madman.
They call me a fool.

384
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:44,797
l say something, people laugh at me.
l do something, people laugh at me.

385
00:47:44,939 --> 00:47:47,339
Even when l scream,
they laugh at me.

386
00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:52,612
They do not see the tears l weep.

387
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:00,246
My brother...

388
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,953
Radha, l want to tell you a story.

389
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,461
Want to listen?

390
00:48:15,036 --> 00:48:16,230
Here goes.

391
00:48:17,872 --> 00:48:22,900
A long time ago,
in the dark of night...

392
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:27,140
a pretty girl from a poor family
ran away from home. You know why?

393
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:32,184
She wanted to marry a rich man.
And why? Because she was in love.

394
00:48:32,987 --> 00:48:36,388
Love drew hearts together...

395
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:41,990
and promises made for an eternity...

396
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,235
were short.lived.
Only a few months.

397
00:48:49,837 --> 00:48:54,240
Lust spent, the storm subsides.

398
00:48:56,877 --> 00:49:01,507
Bubble burst, and her man was gone.

399
00:49:04,118 --> 00:49:10,318
Poor pretty girl couldn't go home.

400
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:15,451
The fire of love burnt in her belly
and she lived like a tramp.

401
00:49:15,763 --> 00:49:19,164
And she cried, and she lived in hope.

402
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:25,266
Then she gave birth to her son.

403
00:49:26,273 --> 00:49:31,836
For the sake of her son, she toiled.
She begged and she went hungry.

404
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:36,245
Then the boy grew up and
went to play with other boys.

405
00:49:39,987 --> 00:49:43,184
Not that he knew how he differed
from the other boys. He didn't.

406
00:49:45,726 --> 00:49:50,891
Then one day, someone asked him
his father's name.

407
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:55,664
From that day, life changed
for mother and son.

408
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:06,237
Women branded his mother ''whore''.

409
00:50:07,415 --> 00:50:11,408
Mother and son ran.
They tried to hide the stigma.

410
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:18,283
They move. From one place to another.
But their shadow chased them.

411
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,624
Then one day,
the poor pretty mother died.

412
00:50:30,571 --> 00:50:32,562
And the boy?
What happened to him?

413
00:50:38,312 --> 00:50:42,112
He couldn't die.
He's still alive.

414
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:46,318
Where is he?

415
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:49,121
Right in front of you.

416
00:50:52,827 --> 00:50:54,124
l am the one.

417
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:44,196
You want to give my son away to
an orphanage, don't you? Take him.

418
00:56:34,935 --> 00:56:36,334
Greetings, Swami.

419
00:56:37,704 --> 00:56:43,199
Mastram, when did you come?
. Just now. But l haven't come alone.

420
00:56:43,343 --> 00:56:48,178
Look, Mastram's pocket edition
... little Mastram.

421
00:56:48,882 --> 00:56:51,146
Go on children, back to play.

422
00:56:54,822 --> 00:56:57,222
Radha, hold him.

423
00:57:00,928 --> 00:57:02,361
He's very energetic.

424
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:15,163
lt's very difficult to take
a mother away from her child.

425
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:27,176
will you stop singing?

426
00:58:29,283 --> 00:58:35,119
This is too long for a song.
And in C sharp.

427
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:38,190
You're by far the best already.

428
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:41,722
Shut up, won't you?

429
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:45,395
Radha is strange.
Left me holding the baby.

430
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:58,177
Your mother has gone to find work.
with the money she earns...

431
00:58:58,312 --> 00:59:02,009
she will buy sweets.
She'll give you sweets.

432
00:59:05,218 --> 00:59:11,020
l know why you're crying.
lt's time you went to sleep.

433
00:59:13,226 --> 00:59:14,955
Go to sleep.

434
00:59:30,978 --> 00:59:32,240
Close your eyes.

435
00:59:39,086 --> 00:59:43,284
No, Chandu. What have l done
to deserve this?.

436
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:45,982
Why did you do this?

437
00:59:50,263 --> 00:59:54,290
My only pantaloons. Wet.
What are you?.

438
00:59:55,235 --> 00:59:59,262
Well never mind.
But you're never on my side.

439
01:00:03,143 --> 01:00:06,010
You know what
the wet feeling is like?

440
01:00:10,884 --> 01:00:13,011
That's the bed creaking.

441
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:22,618
Anything. l'll do any work.
l have worked here before.

442
01:00:22,863 --> 01:00:26,299
Sorry. No vacancy.

443
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:32,262
May l see the old manager?
. He has been transferred.

444
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:37,840
May l see the boss?
. lt's useless.

445
01:00:37,978 --> 01:00:43,746
No. l hear he's very kind.
He'll surely give me a job.

446
01:00:43,884 --> 01:00:47,684
You don't believe me? All right,
come along and see him.

447
01:00:58,065 --> 01:00:59,225
You wait here.

448
01:01:05,772 --> 01:01:09,208
There's a woman. She wants a job.
Says she has worked here earlier.

449
01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:11,600
A woman is looking for a job.
. Then give it to her.

450
01:01:11,678 --> 01:01:13,771
Why are you bothering me?
. l told her we have no vacancies.

451
01:01:13,847 --> 01:01:16,543
But she insists on seeing you.
. l've told you so many times...

452
01:01:16,616 --> 01:01:19,608
not to bother me over trifles.
l don't want to see anyone.

453
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:25,625
l told you. No use seeing him.
He doesn't want to see anyone.

454
01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:34,299
What's it now?.

455
01:01:50,984 --> 01:01:52,144
Surprised?

456
01:01:54,221 --> 01:01:56,655
You must never have imagined
you'd see me here.

457
01:01:59,993 --> 01:02:02,257
But strange are the games
destiny plays.

458
01:02:03,196 --> 01:02:07,189
So here you are, in my office.
Looking for a job.

459
01:02:10,804 --> 01:02:14,672
l never knew....
. l know you don't know...

460
01:02:14,808 --> 01:02:18,869
that l am the owner. Had you known,
you might not have come here.

461
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,937
Am l right?

462
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:32,086
Where are you going?
Don't you want a job?

463
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:46,098
Remember when l wanted
to give you a status?

464
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:48,833
Remember, l wanted to give you
a place in society?

465
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:51,102
Remember, l once wanted
to marry you?

466
01:02:51,244 --> 01:02:52,233
Remember?

467
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:59,114
But muck.raking worms don't
survive in fresh water.

468
01:02:59,986 --> 01:03:02,978
You preferred the streets
to a life of respectability.

469
01:03:03,323 --> 01:03:05,450
Has the road come to a dead end?

470
01:03:05,592 --> 01:03:08,322
What, no one to sympathize
with you anymore?

471
01:03:08,562 --> 01:03:11,463
No one left to win over
with your sob stories?

472
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:15,261
Why look for work?
Why pursue respectability?

473
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:23,206
Begging is easy. Walk the streets
with outstretched arms.

474
01:03:23,276 --> 01:03:26,609
Weep, and you'll enjoy yourself
without having to work for it.

475
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,438
lsn't that what you want?

476
01:03:29,249 --> 01:03:31,240
Fool l was that l wanted
to change you.

477
01:03:38,024 --> 01:03:40,788
Oh yes. Speak. Why hesitate?
Say something.

478
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:44,955
Give what excuses you can.
Tell a white lie. Go on.

479
01:03:45,165 --> 01:03:47,827
Give me those lines
to evoke sympathy.

480
01:03:47,968 --> 01:03:49,959
Not mine. Not any more.

481
01:03:55,108 --> 01:04:00,569
l gave you whatever l had.
My love, my status, my future...

482
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:04,845
it was all yours for the asking.
But you fooled me.

483
01:04:04,985 --> 01:04:06,976
l loved you, and you took it
for a game.

484
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,111
Why have you come here?
Get out.

485
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:12,880
Out.

486
01:05:50,256 --> 01:05:51,746
Whose baby is that?

487
01:05:53,093 --> 01:05:54,754
l'm asking you.

488
01:05:56,196 --> 01:05:57,185
Mine.

489
01:06:13,813 --> 01:06:15,246
When did you marry?

490
01:06:20,053 --> 01:06:21,714
l haven't.

491
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:39,605
Who is his father?

492
01:06:44,144 --> 01:06:48,137
Our landlord.

493
01:06:49,015 --> 01:06:53,952
Manohar, that scoundrel?.

494
01:07:02,128 --> 01:07:04,153
Where is your father?

495
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:08,959
Dead.

496
01:07:09,903 --> 01:07:10,961
When?

497
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:15,900
When he came to know
that l'm pregnant.

498
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:20,204
How did all this happen?.

499
01:07:22,215 --> 01:07:28,916
Why do you want to know how?
l'm ruined. That's all.

500
01:07:30,223 --> 01:07:36,924
No. But this could never happen.
Radha, you must tell me.

501
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:41,689
A girl who is raped because
she doesn't have money...

502
01:07:41,835 --> 01:07:45,669
finds all the doors
shut on her face.

503
01:07:45,738 --> 01:07:52,837
She has no place in society.
For she has lived in sin.

504
01:07:53,947 --> 01:07:58,941
She is cursed.
She is a whore.

505
01:08:14,564 --> 01:08:20,503
Welcome. What brings you here?
You're a rare sight these days.

506
01:08:24,607 --> 01:08:28,509
That look on your face...
as if your mill is on fire.

507
01:08:29,112 --> 01:08:33,446
The fire is raging inside me.
. ls everything all right with you?

508
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:39,988
l'm all right. But that girl...
. Girl? Who's this girl?

509
01:08:43,326 --> 01:08:47,524
Radha.
. Which Radha?

510
01:08:49,532 --> 01:08:53,093
So you've forgotten her?
. Remembering is tough.

511
01:08:53,236 --> 01:08:57,605
l have scores coming
to see me every day.

512
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,140
How many can l remember?

513
01:09:00,777 --> 01:09:03,143
Try hard enough, and you'll remember.

514
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:07,343
The name is Radha.

515
01:09:07,784 --> 01:09:10,344
Which Radha are you talking about?

516
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,282
She and her sick father...

517
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:16,549
used to be tenants
in your hutments.

518
01:09:17,693 --> 01:09:22,289
They were very poor.
They defaulted on the rent.

519
01:09:22,432 --> 01:09:25,492
You wanted to evict them.
Remember?

520
01:09:26,602 --> 01:09:33,303
She came to see you.
She begged you for mercy.

521
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:39,105
Remember her now?
. Oh yes. She did come to me.

522
01:09:39,248 --> 01:09:42,684
But you might not be knowing this.
l decided to forego the debt.

523
01:09:42,885 --> 01:09:47,117
Did you? After you raped her?
. That's a lie.

524
01:09:47,256 --> 01:09:50,054
She has a baby now.
. Nonsense.

525
01:09:50,193 --> 01:09:55,597
You don't know what girls like her
are capable of. She's accusing me...

526
01:09:55,731 --> 01:09:58,199
because she wants to blackmail me.
. Shut up.

527
01:09:58,935 --> 01:10:02,996
She isn't that type.
. So you know her?

528
01:10:03,139 --> 01:10:06,506
l never imagined you'd develop
a soft corner for a girl her type.

529
01:10:06,642 --> 01:10:12,581
But you're a friend. lf you insist,
l'll settle it with cash.

530
01:10:14,283 --> 01:10:18,379
Can money buy respectability for her?
. Why are you so concerned for her?

531
01:10:18,521 --> 01:10:22,423
l'm here to pay you for your deed.
l'll expose you.

532
01:10:22,558 --> 01:10:25,891
l'll tell the world what lies behind
your facade of respectability.

533
01:10:26,028 --> 01:10:31,091
l'll report you to the police.
. Nice way to pass on the buck.

534
01:10:31,234 --> 01:10:34,169
What do you mean?
. What proof the child is mine?

535
01:10:34,303 --> 01:10:37,966
l could say he's yours.
You know her too.

536
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:40,566
Who knows, it might be your baby?
. Scoundrel.

537
01:10:53,556 --> 01:10:56,787
No. Don't hit me. Forgive me.

538
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:02,120
l beg of you.
. She begged of you too.

539
01:11:02,265 --> 01:11:05,564
Did you show her mercy?
You cur.

540
01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:30,687
Where is he gone?

541
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,427
Who are you?

542
01:11:38,568 --> 01:11:43,301
First you say who you are.

543
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:45,168
Where's Radha?

544
01:11:45,308 --> 01:11:49,472
How did you know Radha lives here?
. l met her here a while ago.

545
01:11:51,113 --> 01:11:54,708
You must be the man.
. What do you mean?

546
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:59,844
Clear, isn't it? Radha, the baby
... and the father? You're the one.

547
01:12:00,723 --> 01:12:03,317
Nonsense. Tell me, where's Radha?

548
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:07,554
And l ask you, where
have you been all this while?

549
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:09,994
You put that poor girl in a fix,
and you disappear.

550
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:12,191
Now you walk in and
you start asking questions.

551
01:12:12,268 --> 01:12:16,534
Shut up, l say.
. You shut up. Scoundrel.

552
01:12:19,976 --> 01:12:23,412
Now get me clear.
l'm not his father.

553
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:26,878
The man who ruined Radha
is someone else.

554
01:12:27,016 --> 01:12:29,610
l just came to know all this.
You hear that?.

555
01:12:35,191 --> 01:12:37,159
l wanted to marry Radha.

556
01:12:37,293 --> 01:12:40,990
But before l knew it,
everything went haywire.

557
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:42,998
Radha ran away from me,
for the shame of it.

558
01:12:43,032 --> 01:12:46,024
And l thought she had fooled me.
You hear that?.

559
01:12:46,168 --> 01:12:47,897
Now tell me where Radha is.

560
01:12:48,004 --> 01:12:52,338
l'll give her the honor she has lost.
l'll take on the world for her sake.

561
01:12:52,508 --> 01:12:56,638
l'll marry Radha.
. You'll marry her?.

562
01:12:56,779 --> 01:13:00,374
Yes. l'll marry her.
. But she is tainted.

563
01:13:00,516 --> 01:13:06,113
And she has a baby. A bastard.
. Babies aren't bastards.

564
01:13:06,255 --> 01:13:11,249
Their parents are the bastards.
. You really think that way?.

565
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:13,592
will you marry Radha for real?.

566
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:21,263
No, she isn't here.
. Where has she gone?.

567
01:13:21,537 --> 01:13:24,131
l don't know where she has gone.
. Where could she have gone?

568
01:13:24,273 --> 01:13:27,265
l screamed at her.
l threw her out of my office.

569
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:30,607
Where could she have gone?
. Come with me.

570
01:13:39,488 --> 01:13:44,289
People say that whatever You do,
You always do for the better.

571
01:13:46,028 --> 01:13:49,156
l do not know, what good You seek
to do out of my ruination?

572
01:13:50,499 --> 01:13:53,696
What have You got out of
ruining my life?

573
01:13:55,771 --> 01:14:02,301
l do not understand Your ways.
But l have borne it all.

574
01:14:03,312 --> 01:14:09,512
But l cannot bear it any longer.

575
01:14:10,953 --> 01:14:12,853
l can't bear to live anymore.

576
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:23,257
For one last time,
l stand here before You.

577
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:29,129
This is Your gift to me.
Unto You l commend him.

578
01:14:30,506 --> 01:14:33,475
Now it is Your duty
to look after him.

579
01:14:49,692 --> 01:14:51,284
Where are you going?

580
01:14:52,194 --> 01:14:52,558
Where's the baby?

581
01:14:53,696 --> 01:14:54,958
Where is he?

582
01:14:56,499 --> 01:14:58,490
What are you up to?.
Come with me.

583
01:15:03,506 --> 01:15:04,768
Pick him up.

584
01:15:10,446 --> 01:15:11,708
And look at me.

585
01:15:14,517 --> 01:15:15,506
Radha...

586
01:15:17,253 --> 01:15:19,244
we begin a new life now.

587
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:21,979
Come.

588
01:15:42,545 --> 01:15:43,534
Mother...

589
01:15:48,184 --> 01:15:50,584
Can l give you some good news?
. Yes?

590
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,550
l've decided to marry.

591
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:57,289
ls that so?
l'm very happy.

592
01:15:58,294 --> 01:16:05,393
l've been waiting for this.
l'll find a girl for you.

593
01:16:05,568 --> 01:16:09,937
l'm seeing a girl.
. Who is she?

594
01:16:10,072 --> 01:16:12,165
She's a very good girl.
Good character...

595
01:16:12,241 --> 01:16:15,005
simple, sweet.natured
and beautiful.

596
01:16:15,144 --> 01:16:17,009
She's fantastic.

597
01:16:17,146 --> 01:16:19,546
You're going to like her.
But Mother...

598
01:16:23,652 --> 01:16:25,449
She might be poor.

599
01:16:27,356 --> 01:16:30,792
So what if she doesn't have money?
Money isn't everything in life.

600
01:16:30,926 --> 01:16:33,053
Besides, God has given us
so much already.

601
01:16:33,195 --> 01:16:38,326
And there's something else, Mother.

602
01:16:39,602 --> 01:16:41,593
Yes?

603
01:16:43,105 --> 01:16:44,504
You see...

604
01:16:47,009 --> 01:16:48,476
actually she has a...

605
01:16:49,845 --> 01:16:52,143
Why did you stop? Go on.

606
01:16:52,281 --> 01:16:57,412
Nothing really, but her father
died last year.

607
01:16:57,553 --> 01:16:59,350
Now she has no one.

608
01:16:59,488 --> 01:17:01,479
l want to marry her
as soon as l can.

609
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:09,357
Nirmal, l am sure you're doing this
after due deliberation.

610
01:17:09,498 --> 01:17:11,466
l've thought it over, Mother.

611
01:17:14,503 --> 01:17:20,305
Very well then.
l only want to see you happy.

612
01:17:20,442 --> 01:17:23,639
l'm very happy.
l've never been happier.

613
01:17:28,484 --> 01:17:31,317
Guess what happened?
. What?

614
01:17:31,387 --> 01:17:34,151
My mother has agreed.
. Really?

615
01:17:34,223 --> 01:17:39,092
Yes. So what do you think?
. l am happy. Very happy.

616
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:43,255
And you told your mother everything?
. Everything.

617
01:17:44,266 --> 01:17:45,665
About my son too?

618
01:17:50,339 --> 01:17:55,276
You didn't tell her that.
l know you didn't.

619
01:17:57,112 --> 01:18:01,446
l'll tell her after the wedding.
. No. You must tell her now.

620
01:18:01,517 --> 01:18:05,385
lf l tell her now,
she might not understand.

621
01:18:05,521 --> 01:18:09,355
l know what you've been through.
She doesn't.

622
01:18:10,192 --> 01:18:14,424
l'll tell her after the wedding.
Then she can't misread this.

623
01:18:14,563 --> 01:18:20,399
No. l cannot betray your mother.
She should know everything.

624
01:18:20,536 --> 01:18:24,097
lf she forgives me,
if she gives me her blessings...

625
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:29,575
only then can l marry her.
. Why are you so obstinate?

626
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:33,573
You life was ruined.
You told me nothing.

627
01:18:33,716 --> 01:18:37,311
You went through the worst.
Yet you told me nothing.

628
01:18:37,453 --> 01:18:41,412
l want to marry you. l want to bring
the happiness back into your life.

629
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:44,058
And you refuse me?. Why?

630
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:50,798
Don't you care for me?
Don't you love me?

631
01:18:57,606 --> 01:19:01,667
l don't care for you.
l don't love you.

632
01:19:01,844 --> 01:19:07,407
Lies. You're just trying
to run away from me again.

633
01:19:07,549 --> 01:19:11,883
But l'm not going to let this happen.
l'm not going to let you suffer.

634
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:17,891
l'll face the whole world for you.
And l'll ask them only one question.

635
01:19:18,027 --> 01:19:21,292
Who is at fault?
You? Or that scoundrel?

636
01:19:21,563 --> 01:19:26,591
Why do our peers punish you?
Why spare that scoundrel?

637
01:19:27,202 --> 01:19:30,000
Why must you be made to
carry the cross all your life?

638
01:19:30,139 --> 01:19:34,872
And let those scoundrels
point fingers at you?

639
01:19:39,048 --> 01:19:43,485
No time to weep. lt's time
to come to terms with life.

640
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:46,645
Together, we can make a better life
for ourselves.

641
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:49,314
Only, you will have to help me.

642
01:19:53,595 --> 01:19:58,328
l'll do whatever you want.

643
01:20:14,116 --> 01:20:17,108
This used to be our old house.
. Our new house.

644
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:21,520
My father built it years ago.
But after he died, no one comes here.

645
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:23,284
Make yourselves comfortable here.

646
01:20:25,294 --> 01:20:30,231
Tiger. Cheetah. Deer.
This is a museum.

647
01:20:30,332 --> 01:20:33,392
Hunting was my father's hobby.
. Nice hobby.

648
01:20:33,535 --> 01:20:38,097
They paid with their lives for his
hobby. Not a nice hobby, mister.

649
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:42,108
l'm against violence.
Non.violence is the greatest virtue.

650
01:20:42,244 --> 01:20:46,044
Maybe you're right.
My father paid a price for it.

651
01:20:46,815 --> 01:20:49,306
See this gun?

652
01:20:51,086 --> 01:20:56,046
Aside, please. lf it goes off,
l might end up stuffed and on show.

653
01:20:57,326 --> 01:20:59,317
Not to be afraid.
lt won't go off.

654
01:21:01,663 --> 01:21:06,623
The lone cartridge is still in there.
My father shot himself with the other.

655
01:21:07,503 --> 01:21:10,472
Forget it. Come on,
l'll show you around.

656
01:21:40,736 --> 01:21:46,697
Who you are, what you are...

657
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:51,574
where you are from...
l know nothing.

658
01:21:53,615 --> 01:21:59,554
l don't even know
what your past was.

659
01:22:01,323 --> 01:22:04,315
All l knew was that...

660
01:22:05,827 --> 01:22:11,265
my son wanted to marry you.

661
01:22:12,267 --> 01:22:19,105
As his mother,
l wanted to see him happy.

662
01:22:21,276 --> 01:22:25,576
Now my son has married you.

663
01:22:27,482 --> 01:22:31,282
You enter this house as a bride.

664
01:22:33,288 --> 01:22:36,587
with you, our fortunes are tied.

665
01:22:38,493 --> 01:22:43,556
People have always respected
our family.

666
01:22:45,534 --> 01:22:50,164
No one has ever raised
a finger at us.

667
01:22:55,444 --> 01:23:00,313
Our esteem, our prestige
is in your hands.

668
01:23:07,222 --> 01:23:10,453
Why are you screaming, Chandu?
No, no, Chandu.

669
01:23:13,195 --> 01:23:17,529
You scream worse than the kid.
Can l tell you something?

670
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:20,897
What is it?
. lf you can scream worse...

671
01:23:21,036 --> 01:23:24,028
why don't you join a circus?
. Hey sahib.

672
01:23:24,106 --> 01:23:27,974
l'm tired. l want to get some sleep.
You have to calm this fellow down.

673
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:32,410
He'll calm down in a moment.
l have taken care of dozens.

674
01:23:34,216 --> 01:23:38,482
lt shows. Just stop the circus
and do what l tell you to do.

675
01:23:38,553 --> 01:23:42,148
l think he's hungry.
Give him a feed.

676
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:45,522
He wants his mother.

677
01:23:47,162 --> 01:23:49,562
He wants his uncle.
Give him to me.

678
01:23:58,507 --> 01:24:02,534
Radha, you look anxious.
. He's crying.

679
01:24:04,112 --> 01:24:08,515
Who...?
. My Chandu is crying.

680
01:24:08,617 --> 01:24:13,384
Mastram is with him. And the nurse
who's taking care of him is adept.

681
01:24:13,488 --> 01:24:16,252
He has never stayed
away from me at night.

682
01:24:21,463 --> 01:24:24,523
Please. Take me there.
. Not at this time of the day.

683
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:27,567
You do not understand.
For God's sake. Please take me.

684
01:24:27,636 --> 01:24:32,130
Listen to me. lf Mother gets up,
she will ask a lot of questions.

685
01:24:32,274 --> 01:24:34,572
Try to understand.

686
01:25:22,557 --> 01:25:29,258
Don't cry, my dear. Don't cry.
l'm coming tomorrow.

687
01:25:48,049 --> 01:25:49,676
Chandu my darling, here l am.

688
01:25:50,552 --> 01:25:53,282
Chandu has just fallen asleep.
. Fallen asleep...?

689
01:25:53,355 --> 01:25:57,553
After 12 hours.
. l hope he didn't cry last night.

690
01:25:57,592 --> 01:26:04,293
Didn't he?. He wailed my ears
off my head. But who cares...?

691
01:30:39,337 --> 01:30:44,604
Son, these people have been waiting
to wish you.

692
01:30:45,844 --> 01:30:46,833
Thank you.

693
01:30:55,954 --> 01:30:57,615
Thank you very much.

694
01:31:31,523 --> 01:31:32,649
Yes, mother?

695
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:39,960
ls it true that Radha used to beg
on the streets?

696
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:43,589
Yes.

697
01:31:44,436 --> 01:31:47,599
And she worked in the mill
before you married her?

698
01:31:47,839 --> 01:31:49,773
Yes, she worked in the mill.
l put her on the job.

699
01:31:49,808 --> 01:31:51,605
And she was a good worker.
. But...

700
01:31:51,676 --> 01:31:55,737
What's wrong with working in the mill?
lt was honest hard work after all.

701
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,145
She has been through hard times.
She begged. And then she worked.

702
01:31:59,217 --> 01:32:01,014
lnstead of depending on anyone...

703
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:03,884
she picked up the courage
to confront her circumstance.

704
01:32:03,955 --> 01:32:06,549
l know it doesn't make sense to you.
You live in this grand house.

705
01:32:06,624 --> 01:32:12,426
You've never seen the world outside.
You have no idea about life out there.

706
01:32:12,564 --> 01:32:15,556
You don't know what people have to do
just to keep their esteem intact.

707
01:32:15,633 --> 01:32:21,299
Keep your voice down. When did l say
it's bad to work for a living?

708
01:32:22,574 --> 01:32:26,806
l just mean to say that
you never mentioned it.

709
01:32:27,312 --> 01:32:30,440
l must've forgotten.
l'm sorry.

710
01:32:46,397 --> 01:32:51,892
Please tell your mother everything.
l'm tired of concealing the truth.

711
01:32:52,036 --> 01:32:56,268
l feel like a criminal.
. No use getting agitated.

712
01:32:56,407 --> 01:33:00,343
l'll tell her. l told you l would.
. No, don't put it off any longer.

713
01:33:00,478 --> 01:33:04,710
She must be informed right away.
No matter if she throws me out...

714
01:33:04,849 --> 01:33:09,616
but you must tell her today.
. Tell her, l will. Be patient.

715
01:33:11,523 --> 01:33:16,392
lf you won't tell her,
then l shall.

716
01:33:16,528 --> 01:33:20,294
l'll make a clean breast of it.
l'm going to tell her everything.

717
01:33:24,402 --> 01:33:25,960
All right, l'll talk to her.

718
01:33:50,595 --> 01:33:52,586
Mother, l want to tell you something.

719
01:33:55,567 --> 01:33:56,556
Go on.

720
01:33:56,801 --> 01:33:57,859
You see...

721
01:34:01,339 --> 01:34:02,601
l'll tell you.

722
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,605
Yes. Speaking.

723
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:10,845
What?. ls that so?

724
01:34:13,384 --> 01:34:14,510
l'm coming.

725
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:18,350
There's a problem at the factory
in Manipur. l'm going to the office.

726
01:34:30,768 --> 01:34:35,262
What did your mother say?
. l didn't get the chance to talk.

727
01:34:35,406 --> 01:34:37,465
l'm going to office. lt's urgent.
. What is the matter?

728
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:39,533
l'll get to know once
l get to the office.

729
01:34:40,044 --> 01:34:43,707
Now look, don't you do anything silly
before l'm back. For my sake, please.

730
01:34:50,455 --> 01:34:55,586
Get my residence. Fast.

731
01:34:57,395 --> 01:34:59,124
l'm going to Manipur.

732
01:34:59,197 --> 01:35:01,927
The workers have a right to bonuses.
The manager shouldn't have refused...

733
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,867
to pay them, just because
l hadn't authorized the payment.

734
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:15,443
Mother, the workers in Manipur have
gone on strike. l'm going to Manipur.

735
01:35:28,893 --> 01:35:29,917
Hello, Aunt.

736
01:35:30,495 --> 01:35:32,622
Manohar, welcome.

737
01:35:33,865 --> 01:35:36,561
So how have you been?
. Alive. But surely...

738
01:35:36,634 --> 01:35:40,695
you must've thought that l'm dead.
. What a thing to say.

739
01:35:40,772 --> 01:35:44,765
The whole town was invited
to Nirmal's wedding.

740
01:35:44,909 --> 01:35:46,968
l wasn't even informed.
. Nirmal might have...

741
01:35:47,045 --> 01:35:52,540
forgotten to invite you.
. To err is human.

742
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:58,445
Now the lady l saw leaving
in the car, is she the one...?

743
01:35:58,556 --> 01:36:03,584
Yes. She's Nirmal's wife.
. She looks familiar.

744
01:36:04,195 --> 01:36:06,595
Now where have l seen her...?

745
01:36:06,764 --> 01:36:10,666
You must've seen her at the mill.
She used to work there.

746
01:36:10,802 --> 01:36:15,205
Really? l thought he married
someone from a good family.

747
01:36:16,107 --> 01:36:21,010
Have no doubt. She might be poor.
But she comes from a good family.

748
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:27,212
How foolish of me. As long as
you're sitting here, how could...

749
01:36:27,352 --> 01:36:30,685
someone from some not.so.good.a.family
walk into this house?

750
01:36:32,523 --> 01:36:35,617
But l've surely seen her somewhere.

751
01:36:37,595 --> 01:36:40,689
Oh yes, l remember. She's the lady
who keeps going in and coming out...

752
01:36:40,765 --> 01:36:45,702
of your old house. l keep seeing her
on my way to office and back.

753
01:36:45,837 --> 01:36:49,000
l noticed your car parked outside.
Then l saw her.

754
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:52,906
So l guessed that she and Nirmal
must be living in the old house.

755
01:36:54,045 --> 01:36:57,947
Must've gone there to take a look.
We own the house, you see.

756
01:36:58,883 --> 01:37:03,582
Would you like a drink, Manohar?
. No thank you. l was passing by.

757
01:37:04,155 --> 01:37:08,182
l thought l'd see my old friend
and do the courtesy of wishing him.

758
01:37:09,594 --> 01:37:14,657
Oh, l'm late. Excuse me Aunt,
l must be leaving.

759
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:23,605
Where's my brother?
. Sitting. Over there, Miss.

760
01:37:24,008 --> 01:37:26,374
Not Miss again.
. Excuse me, madam.

761
01:37:26,444 --> 01:37:31,677
l don't know what's come over him.
All he does is sleep and scream.

762
01:37:32,884 --> 01:37:36,843
Why, what's the matter?
. None at all.

763
01:37:36,988 --> 01:37:40,355
No matters, no issues,
nothing special and for no reason.

764
01:37:40,825 --> 01:37:41,951
Understand?

765
01:37:42,693 --> 01:37:43,955
No you don't.

766
01:37:44,896 --> 01:37:48,491
Are you angry with me because l've
put you through so much trouble?

767
01:37:48,633 --> 01:37:51,500
Oh yes, l'm angry.
But not at you.

768
01:37:51,636 --> 01:37:54,434
l'm angry with myself.
l don't understand this.

769
01:37:54,572 --> 01:37:59,305
How could a little boy make
me forget my Mast Manor?.

770
01:37:59,877 --> 01:38:02,778
Radha, please let me go.
My Manor is lying empty.

771
01:38:02,914 --> 01:38:08,045
without you, this house
is going to feel empty.

772
01:38:08,453 --> 01:38:11,388
You have been so kind to me.
. Don't mention it.

773
01:38:11,522 --> 01:38:15,424
l'm paying back my mother's kindness
to another mother.

774
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,528
That settles my score. Get it?

775
01:38:17,662 --> 01:38:19,755
No, you won't understand.
But never mind that.

776
01:38:19,897 --> 01:38:21,922
l'm leaving now.
Let me know if you need me.

777
01:38:24,068 --> 01:38:29,665
All l am today, all l have,
is all because of you.

778
01:38:29,974 --> 01:38:32,966
l'm indebted to you.
. Are you mad?

779
01:38:33,811 --> 01:38:35,802
No obligations between
brother and sister.

780
01:38:39,417 --> 01:38:40,679
See you, then.

781
01:42:04,622 --> 01:42:06,283
Where's Radha?

782
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:09,482
l want to know where Radha is.
. Upstairs.

783
01:42:27,511 --> 01:42:28,944
Madam...

784
01:42:30,581 --> 01:42:31,775
What is it?

785
01:43:09,687 --> 01:43:12,485
Wait. Please.

786
01:43:12,623 --> 01:43:15,217
Please. Listen to me.

787
01:43:47,892 --> 01:43:48,881
Mercy.

788
01:43:51,428 --> 01:43:52,918
Have mercy on me.

789
01:43:56,834 --> 01:43:59,598
Please. Have mercy on me.

790
01:44:03,607 --> 01:44:05,598
You bore the child before the wedding.

791
01:44:11,816 --> 01:44:15,752
You never even told me.
You have cheated me.

792
01:44:15,886 --> 01:44:23,258
l never intended to.
l told him to tell you everything.

793
01:44:23,394 --> 01:44:29,629
But he wouldn't listen to me.
lt isn't my fault.

794
01:44:29,834 --> 01:44:34,464
l could never have imagined
that my son would stoop so low.

795
01:44:34,605 --> 01:44:36,937
No. Please do not say that.

796
01:44:37,641 --> 01:44:40,701
He is a God.

797
01:44:40,878 --> 01:44:41,867
Silence.

798
01:44:42,446 --> 01:44:47,440
He's just as responsible for this
as you are. He's just as rotten.

799
01:44:47,585 --> 01:44:48,882
No.

800
01:44:56,794 --> 01:45:02,790
He has nothing to do with the baby.
The baby isn't his.

801
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,730
Not Nirmal's?.
. No.

802
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:09,772
Do you realize what you are saying?
. l'm telling you the truth.

803
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,604
Then you will leave this house.
At this moment.

804
01:45:13,143 --> 01:45:18,706
Mercy. Have mercy on me.
l am completely innocent.

805
01:45:18,849 --> 01:45:22,785
lnnocent?. You have lived in sin.
You are a whore.

806
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,911
You aren't fit to be part
of any family.

807
01:45:27,291 --> 01:45:29,623
Mercy. Have mercy on me.

808
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,819
l told you that the fortunes
of my family are tied to you.

809
01:45:32,563 --> 01:45:34,827
To you l entrusted
my family's esteem.

810
01:45:34,999 --> 01:45:40,904
You have brought us to disrepute.
You have tainted us. Forever.

811
01:45:43,874 --> 01:45:45,865
You aren't fit to be part
of this family.

812
01:45:46,944 --> 01:45:51,040
You have no place in this house.
You belong to the gutters.

813
01:45:56,921 --> 01:46:01,324
Throw her out.
What are you waiting for?

814
01:50:36,934 --> 01:50:40,870
'Your mother has come to know
about everything.''

815
01:50:41,004 --> 01:50:42,995
''She has thrown me
out of the house.''

816
01:50:47,544 --> 01:50:50,069
''l wanted to escape
this cruel world.''

817
01:50:50,214 --> 01:50:53,741
''But my life isn't only mine.
So l couldn't kill myself.''

818
01:50:53,884 --> 01:50:58,480
''But l can't bear to live any longer.
l can't take this anymore.''

819
01:50:58,622 --> 01:51:01,853
''Please come back as soon as you
receive this letter. Or else.''

820
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:35,118
What was that?.

821
01:51:40,797 --> 01:51:42,788
What was that sound?.

822
01:52:03,854 --> 01:52:05,947
Where have you been?.
You left me all alone.

823
01:52:07,557 --> 01:52:11,288
Why did you leave me?
Why have you been so long?

824
01:52:12,429 --> 01:52:16,866
l was worried you'd
never come back to me.

825
01:52:20,771 --> 01:52:25,936
Don't weep, Radha.
l won't leave you ever again.

826
01:52:28,578 --> 01:52:29,567
Rise

827
01:52:34,351 --> 01:52:38,651
You are about to face
the harshest test of your life.

828
01:52:39,956 --> 01:52:44,586
As long as l have you beside me,
l fear nothing.

829
01:52:46,697 --> 01:52:49,257
l shall never leave you.

830
01:52:52,302 --> 01:52:55,135
You are completely drenched.
How did you get wet?

831
01:53:02,012 --> 01:53:04,446
You should change your clothes.
. My dress will dry up.

832
01:53:04,481 --> 01:53:07,780
No, you'd catch a cold.
The weather is chilly.

833
01:53:07,918 --> 01:53:14,482
Weather can touch me no more.

834
01:53:15,492 --> 01:53:17,619
And no thoughts cross my mind.

835
01:53:18,795 --> 01:53:20,729
Except you.

836
01:53:21,631 --> 01:53:23,895
There's a storm coming up.

837
01:58:00,477 --> 01:58:04,846
The car has been found.
But Mr Nirmal wasn't in it.

838
01:58:06,883 --> 01:58:11,149
We assume that he might have
fallen out of the car.

839
01:58:14,557 --> 01:58:18,516
The current might have taken him
somewhere else.

840
01:58:20,897 --> 01:58:25,664
Or might be, he was swept on to
some outcrop...

841
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:38,970
A complete search operation
must be conducted.

842
01:58:39,983 --> 01:58:45,512
l shall try my best. And as soon
as we have news, l'll inform you.

843
01:58:52,762 --> 01:58:54,161
Madam...

844
01:58:54,297 --> 01:58:55,286
Get up.

845
01:58:57,834 --> 01:59:00,098
What is the matter?
. Your husband met with an accident.

846
01:59:00,136 --> 01:59:02,570
What?
. His car fell into a river.

847
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:04,869
He was in the car.
. What are you saying?

848
01:59:04,908 --> 01:59:08,503
lt's true. People from the mill
went to meet his mother.

849
01:59:08,578 --> 01:59:11,638
They couldn't find his body.
. You're out of your mind.

850
01:59:11,715 --> 01:59:14,650
He was here last night.
We even had dinner together.

851
01:59:14,784 --> 01:59:16,308
He must be here.

852
01:59:21,925 --> 01:59:22,914
Listen...

853
01:59:23,293 --> 01:59:25,523
Where is he...?
. He never came here.

854
01:59:25,662 --> 01:59:27,789
You must've been dreaming.
. Shut up.

855
01:59:33,737 --> 01:59:36,831
What are you looking for?
He never came here.

856
02:00:06,503 --> 02:00:08,334
Shut the doors.

857
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:27,856
Radha, do you hear me?

858
02:00:29,592 --> 02:00:33,653
You are weeping?
This is no time to weep.

859
02:00:34,597 --> 02:00:39,398
This is no place to weep.
You will find no sympathy here.

860
02:00:40,003 --> 02:00:42,597
Go back.

861
02:00:43,139 --> 02:00:45,607
Be brave.

862
02:00:46,142 --> 02:00:49,805
l'm with you.
l'll always be with you.

863
02:00:50,613 --> 02:00:53,810
Go home, Radha.
Go back home.

864
02:00:56,486 --> 02:01:00,616
Do not be disappointed with life.
Life is too precious.

865
02:01:01,891 --> 02:01:06,419
You have suffered for your innocence.
But it has not gone waste.

866
02:01:07,497 --> 02:01:11,627
Do not lose courage.
You have to do your duty.

867
02:01:12,769 --> 02:01:15,829
This world of civilized savages
you will have to reform.

868
02:01:16,773 --> 02:01:19,640
Unto the dark heart of society
you will have to show the light.

869
02:01:19,776 --> 02:01:22,643
To humanity dying of decadence,
you will infuse a new life.

870
02:01:23,646 --> 02:01:25,637
You have much to do, Radha.

871
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:40,818
Surprised to see me?

872
02:01:41,831 --> 02:01:44,925
As for me, l expected
a rousing welcome.

873
02:01:45,902 --> 02:01:48,598
But we won't mind it, shall we?

874
02:01:50,807 --> 02:01:53,071
Get out of here, l say.

875
02:01:53,209 --> 02:01:58,738
l will. As soon as you've agreed
to my proposition.

876
02:01:59,415 --> 02:02:01,474
l tell you...
. l'm telling you to come with me.

877
02:02:01,618 --> 02:02:07,648
You talked that idiot Nirmal into
marrying you. Brilliant.

878
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:11,419
Now Nirmal is dead. And you've been
thrown out of that house.

879
02:02:13,630 --> 02:02:18,897
Look Radha, you're still beautiful.
Lovable. So come with me.

880
02:02:22,538 --> 02:02:27,908
And that boy. You insist he's mine.
Well, he can tag along too.

881
02:02:28,945 --> 02:02:31,778
Every pleasure in life
will be yours.

882
02:02:52,602 --> 02:02:58,268
Excellent. l see that you
are very pragmatic, Radha.

883
02:02:58,408 --> 02:03:02,174
Get out of my way.
. l've been waiting for you.

884
02:03:02,345 --> 02:03:07,476
Go away from here.
. with you, of course.

885
02:03:09,385 --> 02:03:12,616
l have bought a lovely villa far away
from the madding crowd. For you.

886
02:03:12,822 --> 02:03:15,017
You will be very comfortable there.

887
02:03:25,168 --> 02:03:28,228
Go away from here.
Or l'll kill you.

888
02:03:28,871 --> 02:03:29,895
Get lost.

889
02:03:30,873 --> 02:03:33,637
l have already lost my hear
to your beauty.

890
02:03:34,143 --> 02:03:36,941
What use threatening me
with an empty gun?

891
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:40,641
Go away from here, l say.
. Come to your senses, Radha.

892
02:03:40,717 --> 02:03:44,414
Aren't you ashamed to threaten me?
Have you forgotten the day...

893
02:03:44,487 --> 02:03:48,548
when you came to me?
You came to me. Remember?

894
02:03:48,691 --> 02:03:53,594
And l helped you.
. You exploited my poverty.

895
02:03:53,663 --> 02:03:58,532
And l was foolish then. l was just
a girl. Today, l am a married woman.

896
02:04:00,703 --> 02:04:01,931
Married woman?.

897
02:04:04,207 --> 02:04:06,334
Go away.

898
02:04:07,176 --> 02:04:08,165
Go away.

899
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:38,890
Brother...

900
02:05:44,907 --> 02:05:46,636
Brother.

901
02:05:52,448 --> 02:05:54,643
Radha, what happened to you?

902
02:05:54,884 --> 02:05:56,784
l've killed him.
. Whom?

903
02:05:56,853 --> 02:05:58,844
l killed him.
l killed him.

904
02:05:58,888 --> 02:06:00,947
Who...?
. l killed him.

905
02:06:02,058 --> 02:06:05,653
Who have you killed?
. That scoundrel.

906
02:06:06,429 --> 02:06:08,590
Manohar...?
. Yes.

907
02:06:08,731 --> 02:06:11,131
He came to take me and my baby.

908
02:06:11,267 --> 02:06:14,828
l killed him. He'll never make
me feel miserable again.

909
02:06:14,971 --> 02:06:18,964
He'll never make me feel
miserable again.

910
02:06:28,651 --> 02:06:30,676
Radha, where's Nirmal?

911
02:06:33,689 --> 02:06:35,088
Where's Nirmal?

912
02:06:42,298 --> 02:06:45,927
He's no more. No more.

913
02:06:46,068 --> 02:06:48,059
What are you saying, Radha?

914
02:06:49,839 --> 02:06:53,832
l'm a widow now. A widow.

915
02:07:17,934 --> 02:07:22,667
A man was murdered in your house.
Do you know who killed him?

916
02:07:25,174 --> 02:07:26,539
l killed him.

917
02:07:26,609 --> 02:07:28,668
You have to come with me.

918
02:07:46,229 --> 02:07:47,890
Tears? ln your eyes?

919
02:07:51,534 --> 02:07:52,762
Who is it?.

920
02:07:53,769 --> 02:07:56,101
You do not even recognize
my voice, Mother?

921
02:07:56,239 --> 02:07:58,230
My son. Where are you?.

922
02:07:59,642 --> 02:08:03,635
Where are you, my darling?.

923
02:08:05,581 --> 02:08:08,709
Close, very close to you.

924
02:08:08,851 --> 02:08:13,311
But why the tears in your eyes?
You should not weep.

925
02:08:14,457 --> 02:08:21,192
What is it that you do not have?
A palatial house, acres of land...

926
02:08:21,330 --> 02:08:26,324
huge factories, wealth, esteem,
status, you have it all.

927
02:08:28,904 --> 02:08:33,136
l want none of that.
You are all l have.

928
02:08:33,276 --> 02:08:36,803
Come back to me, my son.

929
02:08:36,946 --> 02:08:40,677
That time lies in the past now.
l cannot come back now.

930
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:42,809
My son.

931
02:08:44,887 --> 02:08:48,755
Your misplaced sense of honor,
has destroyed my family.

932
02:08:50,126 --> 02:08:52,321
You sent my Radha away.

933
02:08:52,461 --> 02:08:53,450
Son.

934
02:08:56,899 --> 02:09:01,461
She cheated you.
She brought us to dishonor.

935
02:09:01,937 --> 02:09:04,633
You do not know what kind
of a woman she is.

936
02:09:05,841 --> 02:09:07,035
l know.

937
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:09,307
She also has a child.

938
02:09:09,445 --> 02:09:15,315
l know. She never hid anything
from me. She is innocent.

939
02:09:16,786 --> 02:09:19,755
Radha is as innocent
as the morning star.

940
02:09:20,923 --> 02:09:23,653
She is as pure as
the idols you worship.

941
02:09:26,329 --> 02:09:30,993
The devil might smear your idol
with filth.

942
02:09:31,067 --> 02:09:34,002
Yet Mother, you will not say that
the idol you worship is desecrated.

943
02:09:34,070 --> 02:09:35,935
What are you saying, son?

944
02:09:37,673 --> 02:09:43,407
lt is a story of a rich man's lust
and a poor girl's helplessness.

945
02:09:46,315 --> 02:09:51,878
That scoundrel raped her.
l wanted to help her.

946
02:09:52,888 --> 02:09:56,619
l wanted to give her the honor
the happiness she had lost.

947
02:09:57,626 --> 02:09:59,924
That is why l married her.

948
02:10:05,401 --> 02:10:07,926
But like the rest of the world,
you too were blind. You disowned her.

949
02:10:09,238 --> 02:10:12,639
She too is someone's daughter.
That you did not consider.

950
02:10:14,777 --> 02:10:18,645
Had it been your own daughter,
what would you have done?

951
02:10:18,848 --> 02:10:24,445
Forgive me, son.
l knew nothing.

952
02:10:25,755 --> 02:10:28,918
l'll bring her back.
l promise you, l will.

953
02:10:30,860 --> 02:10:35,661
Bring her back, l will.
. But the police has arrested her.

954
02:10:35,798 --> 02:10:41,600
What?
. She killed the man who raped her.

955
02:10:42,471 --> 02:10:45,269
For all her innocence, Radha
is again being pronounced guilty.

956
02:10:46,809 --> 02:10:49,471
You must go and tell the world
what the truth is.

957
02:10:49,678 --> 02:10:53,478
You will tell them what Radha is.
You will tell them...

958
02:10:53,616 --> 02:10:56,608
how that scoundrel took advantage
of Radha's helplessness.

959
02:10:56,752 --> 02:10:59,448
Tell them how he ruined her.

960
02:10:59,588 --> 02:11:03,820
Show them how the social mores
have punished an innocent girl.

961
02:11:05,494 --> 02:11:09,931
l will. l will tell them.
Right now.

962
02:11:25,848 --> 02:11:28,646
You think Radha is guilty.

963
02:11:29,452 --> 02:11:34,651
You are wrong, as l was wrong.

964
02:11:35,591 --> 02:11:40,654
Radha stands before the law
accused of murder.

965
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:47,396
Let the law take its own course.
l have nothing to tell the law.

966
02:11:47,536 --> 02:11:52,269
But you l ask, what crime is Radha's?

967
02:11:52,408 --> 02:11:54,740
Why do you call her a criminal?

968
02:11:57,279 --> 02:11:59,941
will you grant a scoundrel,
the benefit of being innocent?

969
02:12:00,015 --> 02:12:03,212
And you label an innocent girl
a criminal?

970
02:12:03,352 --> 02:12:07,789
ls it because a woman stands weak,
muted before the tyranny of man?

971
02:12:08,457 --> 02:12:11,483
Then l ask you as a woman,
why not punish the scoundrels?

972
02:12:11,627 --> 02:12:16,030
will you punish the innocent
because she is a woman?

973
02:12:16,899 --> 02:12:21,632
These scoundrels, they are men.
They walk with their heads held high.

974
02:12:21,704 --> 02:12:26,038
And the world respects them.
So they sit in the pulpit...

975
02:12:26,108 --> 02:12:29,908
and they point fingers at the woman,
whom they have denigrated.

976
02:12:29,979 --> 02:12:34,916
Have you ever considered the fate
of these innocent girls?

977
02:12:34,984 --> 02:12:38,147
As l have done to Radha,
they are disowned by family...

978
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:41,587
shunned by society and
discarded by this world.

979
02:12:41,657 --> 02:12:49,257
After that, the disrepute
drives them to death.

980
02:12:49,465 --> 02:12:52,798
Or else, they are relegated
to live life in indignity.

981
02:12:54,904 --> 02:12:59,466
Had it been your daughter,
or your son's wife...

982
02:12:59,608 --> 02:13:05,342
standing in Radha's place,
what would you have done?

983
02:13:05,481 --> 02:13:09,884
Ask yourselves, search within
and you will find the answer.

984
02:13:10,886 --> 02:13:15,016
Radha is someone's daughter.
Radha is someone's wife too.

985
02:13:15,758 --> 02:13:23,290
She cries out to you for justice.
She cries out for your help.

986
02:13:23,532 --> 02:13:28,299
Sympathize with her.
Give her back the honor she has lost.

987
02:13:28,904 --> 02:13:32,465
Give her a chance to start afresh.

988
02:13:32,608 --> 02:13:38,376
l do not ask for mercy,
l seek justice for Radha.

989
02:13:38,447 --> 02:13:41,075
The law will give it's justice.

990
02:13:41,150 --> 02:13:42,879
l ask you to do justice
to your daughters.

991
02:13:50,526 --> 02:13:54,587
The jury has decided that...

992
02:13:55,831 --> 02:13:59,858
the accused acted in self defense.

993
02:14:00,536 --> 02:14:08,272
The accused is found not guilty.
This court exonerates Radha.

994
02:14:17,553 --> 02:14:19,350
Chandu. My darling.

995
02:14:21,423 --> 02:14:22,822
Where's Chandu?

996
02:14:24,393 --> 02:14:27,521
Must be somewhere around.
Chandu, your uncle is here.

997
02:14:32,868 --> 02:14:33,892
Oh l forgot.

998
02:14:33,936 --> 02:14:38,930
He must've taken the nanny out.
l mean, vice versa...

999
02:14:45,781 --> 02:14:47,772
Your baby isn't here.

1000
02:14:49,351 --> 02:14:50,978
He's in his house.

1001
02:14:55,791 --> 02:14:56,985
Come with me.

1002
02:14:59,862 --> 02:15:02,854
You? Here?.

1003
02:15:02,898 --> 02:15:07,267
You object?
. None.

1004
02:15:07,403 --> 02:15:11,601
l and my Mast Manor are honored.

1005
02:15:11,874 --> 02:15:16,470
No mother would do what you did.

1006
02:15:16,612 --> 02:15:19,410
Shut up, and come with me.

1007
02:15:20,482 --> 02:15:21,847
with you...?

1008
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:27,553
Any objections?
. None. Thanks for asking me.

1009
02:15:27,623 --> 02:15:31,024
l was going to come with you anyway.
. Shut up.

1010
02:15:54,316 --> 02:15:55,305
My darling.

1011
02:16:59,748 --> 02:17:00,737
Son...

1012
02:17:02,151 --> 02:17:07,316
l've done whatever
you wanted me to do.

1013
02:17:07,923 --> 02:17:10,653
You'll forgive me now, won't you?

1014
02:17:12,394 --> 02:17:13,383
Mother...

1015
02:17:18,667 --> 02:17:20,032
Mother, l'm here.

1016
02:17:20,202 --> 02:17:22,602
My son.

1017
02:17:29,511 --> 02:17:30,603
My darling.

1018
02:17:39,655 --> 02:17:43,352
People gave me up for dead.
But God saved me.

1019
02:17:43,892 --> 02:17:48,852
And l used the opportunity
to prove Radha's innocence.

1020
02:17:49,631 --> 02:17:52,896
l knew you'd tell the world
that Radha is innocent.

1021
02:17:53,035 --> 02:17:57,699
And you carried it off so well.
l could never have done...

1022
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:00,968
what you did for Radha.
l'm proud of you, Mother.

1023
02:18:05,314 --> 02:18:07,942
Guess where l hid that night?

1024
02:18:10,886 --> 02:18:14,947
l have no idea.
. Under your bed.

1025
02:18:15,657 --> 02:18:17,318
You're an imp.

1026
02:18:17,926 --> 02:18:20,827
Why did you punish me like this?.

1027
02:18:20,963 --> 02:18:24,524
l had lost a dear one.
l stayed away from you so that...

1028
02:18:24,666 --> 02:18:29,194
you could know how hard it is
when one loses someone so dear.

1029
02:18:38,947 --> 02:18:40,938
Radha, my child.

1030
02:18:45,821 --> 02:18:48,221
Come over here. All of you.

1031
02:18:48,357 --> 02:18:51,622
Radha. Hurry.

1032
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:01,963
Come Radha. Come my child.

1033
02:19:02,905 --> 02:19:04,930
My lost son is back.

1034
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:09,643
The love of my life.
He is back.

1035
02:19:18,654 --> 02:19:19,643
Alive.

1036
02:19:29,298 --> 02:19:33,029
They tell you not to believe
your ears.

1037
02:19:33,168 --> 02:19:36,569
l say, don't even believe
your eyes.

1038
02:19:37,506 --> 02:19:39,667
Oh no. l understand it at last.

1039
02:19:39,908 --> 02:19:43,901
Watch it. You'll drop my baby.

1040
02:19:50,719 --> 02:19:54,280
Get me my best dress.
And my jewelry.

1041
02:19:54,423 --> 02:19:59,292
l'll adorn my Radha in finery.
Come on, we have work to do.

1042
02:20:12,641 --> 02:20:14,939
Well Mastram, what say you?

1043
02:20:15,978 --> 02:20:17,969
l don't think l quite understand...

1044
02:20:19,047 --> 02:20:22,949
There are lots you won't.

1045
02:20:24,519 --> 02:20:26,646
Are you weeping?

1046
02:20:26,955 --> 02:20:29,423
This is surely a first.

1047
02:20:30,859 --> 02:20:34,317
For the first time in my life,
l have witnessed such joy.

1048
02:20:38,934 --> 02:20:41,129
What are you fellows waiting for?

1049
02:20:41,269 --> 02:20:43,931
Radha isn't wearing a bride's attire,
don't you see?

1050
02:20:44,006 --> 02:20:45,997
She's still dressed
in the widow's black.

1051
02:20:46,074 --> 02:20:48,599
Now come on, upstairs.
Hurry up.

1052
02:20:53,281 --> 02:20:54,748
Say what, Mastram?
