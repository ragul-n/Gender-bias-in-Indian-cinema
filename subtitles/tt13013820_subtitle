00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,625
<i>Hello. Juhu Police Station.</i>

2
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,958
Whenever I ask
you about Rahul's case,

3
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:23,042
you say investigation is going on.

4
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,042
Madam, breakfast.

5
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,458
Please sit down.

6
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:48,833
We won't waste time in
greeting each other.

7
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,292
Let's come straight to the topic.

8
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,208
I know our company's condition
is not good these days,

9
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:56,583
but now I'll be the one taking
all the decisions of the company

10
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,500
I want to see all the
project reports.

11
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,292
Driver, stop at some medical store.

12
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,625
Yes, madam.

13
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,667
-Driver.
-Yes.

14
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,958
Take this money and get these medicines.

15
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,250
Yes, madam. I'll get it right away.

16
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,167
Madam?

17
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,458
Madam?

18
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,875
Anybody there?

19
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,625
Save me!

20
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,625
Who's here?

21
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,292
Who is here?

22
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,792
Anybody there? Help!

23
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,750
Who are you?

24
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,458
Don't shout.
Quiet!

25
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,458
Be quiet.

26
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,583
It is said, abusing makes
one's language fowl.

27
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:25,500
And, it doesn't suit
a gorgeous lady like you.

28
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,417
Kill me.

29
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:36,083
If I die by your hands,
I'll think I've attained heaven.

30
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:40,375
What is your motive behind kidnapping me?

31
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,125
What is the hurry?

32
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,875
We've just met, sweetheart.

33
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,292
Who are you?

34
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,875
You've got an entire lifetime to know me.

35
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:54,125
Try and think,
you might remember me.

36
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,542
Right now, I am in the
mood for dinner.

37
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,042
<i>My love for you is do deep</i>

38
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,125
<i>That it cannot be measured</i>

39
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:11,833
<i>All I know is that I can't live
Without you by by my side</i>

40
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:15,792
Will you open my blindfold?

41
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,417
I also want to see
who can't live without me.

42
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:27,042
Are you sure that you want to see me?

43
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,292
Yes.

44
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:34,750
Okay, first promise me that
you won't scream after seeing me.

45
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,708
Okay, I promise.

46
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,750
Then I don't have any problem.

47
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,083
Yash!

48
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,792
Yes, it's me. Yash Kadam!

49
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,708
Oh no, failed again.

50
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:13,083
What happened, Natasha?
Why are you so worried?

51
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,875
I am not able to conduct
this experiment, sir.

52
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,583
I don't know what to do.

53
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,958
Don't worry. I will help you.

54
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,458
Pour this liquid first.

55
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,208
And now mix this one.

56
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,458
See, no fumes are coming out now.

57
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:37,792
It was so easy.

58
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,167
Yes, I am absolutely fine.

59
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,125
You take care of yourself.

60
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,292
Yes mom, I am taking care of myself.

61
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,208
Okay, goodnight.

62
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,333
It's here.

63
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,083
Friend request has been accepted.

64
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,125
Oh, my god.

65
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,792
<i>Ramaiya you will come.</i>

66
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,583
<i>Ramaiya you will come.</i>

67
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,542
<i>I gave my heart to you.</i>

68
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,250
<i>I gave my heart to you.</i>

69
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,208
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

70
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,875
Oh shit,
should I directly say I love you?

71
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,000
No, no how can I do that...

72
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,167
What if she gets angry?

73
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,333
Natasha, I love you so much,
I love you so much...

74
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,500
Should I go down on my knees and propose?

75
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:14,833
I love you a lot. I like you very much.

76
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,167
Oh my, god.

77
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,542
She's coming.

78
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,792
What should I do now?

79
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,083
Where do I hide the flower?

80
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,167
What do I do now?

81
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,375
Sir, you called me?

82
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,250
-Yes, flower.
-Flower?

83
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,375
No...

84
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,083
Yes...
No...

85
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,125
Research on flowers.

86
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,625
I mean...

87
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,750
We have to go for a Botany
research for two days.

88
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,458
Okay, sir. Anything else?

89
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:28,542
<i>Your love is always there</i>

90
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:33,542
<i>In my heart and soul</i>

91
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:41,458
<i>All I can see is your beautiful face</i>

92
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:46,417
<i>It be in my dreams or anywhere else</i>

93
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:52,417
<i>Not a single moment of my life</i>

94
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,667
<i>Is separate from you</i>

95
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:03,125
<i>Your love is always there</i>

96
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:08,417
<i>In my heart and soul</i>

97
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,417
<i>All I can see is your beautiful face</i>

98
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,250
<i>It be in my dreams or anywhere else</i>

99
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:35,167
<i>Come closer and listen</i>

100
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,208
<i>To what my heart says</i>

101
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:45,792
<i>Every time my heart beats</i>

102
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:50,417
<i>It beats for you</i>

103
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:56,375
<i>Not a single moment of my life</i>

104
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:01,750
<i>Is separate from you</i>

105
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:07,083
<i>Your love is always there</i>

106
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:12,333
<i>In my heart and soul</i>

107
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,416
<i>All I can see is your beautiful face</i>

108
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,875
<i>It be in my dreams or anywhere else</i>

109
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:39,125
<i>If you are not mine</i>

110
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:44,167
<i>Then I'll leave this world</i>

111
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:49,792
<i>Without you my love</i>

112
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:55,042
<i>My desires will remain unfulfilled</i>

113
00:17:55,292 --> 00:18:00,500
<i>Not a single moment of my life</i>

114
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:05,750
<i>Is separate from you.</i>

115
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:10,917
<i>Your love is always there</i>

116
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:16,000
<i>In my heart and soul</i>

117
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,417
<i>All I can see is your beautiful face</i>

118
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:26,542
<i>It be in my dreams or anywhere else</i>

119
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,500
How are you, sir?

120
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,208
I am fine.

121
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Sir, I was looking for you.

122
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,167
I am leaving today
and wanted to thank you.

123
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,833
-But... suddenly?
-Yes, sir.

124
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:52,417
My thesis is completed and mom wants
me to spend some time with her.

125
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,292
That's a very good thing.

126
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,917
You should spend some
time with your mother.

127
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,417
In fact, we should all spend
time with our mother.

128
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,833
Put your left hand forward sir.

129
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,167
This is for you.

130
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,917
You helped me so much.

131
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
Encouraged me so much.

132
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,292
If it wasn't for you, I don't know if I
could've completed this course or not.

133
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:19,250
Now whenever you look at this,
you will think of me.

134
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,958
And sir,
I will miss your class a lot.

135
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,167
<i>After you had left...
life came to a standstill.</i>

136
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,125
<i>I couldn't focus on anything.</i>

137
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,917
<i>I would keep looking at the time.</i>

138
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,500
<i>It seemed as if time had stopped.</i>

139
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:08,000
<i>But I couldn't find you,
nor peace and serenity.</i>

140
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:13,750
<i>And then I decided that why don't
I present myself before you.</i>

141
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,250
<i>I searched you on Facebook,</i>

142
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:21,667
<i>and found out that, you're working
in Mumbai, at Wockhardt company.</i>

143
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,500
<i>I wanted to come before
you and surprise you.</i>

144
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,667
<i>I wanted to see the
expression on your face,</i>

145
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,375
<i>that one gets when they
suddenly get a surprise.</i>

146
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,542
<i>I came straight to your office.</i>

147
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,375
<i>I was very excited that day.</i>

148
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,667
<i>I thought, you will be very
happy to see me.</i>

149
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:44,292
<i>That's why I stood outside your
office all day, waiting for you.</i>

150
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,167
<i>But you didn't even notice me.</i>

151
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,458
<i>Then I went to your house.</i>

152
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,333
<i>Then suddenly I thought...</i>

153
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,875
<i>What if you have a boyfriend?</i>

154
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,667
<i>That's when I decided, to stay close
to you and keep an eye on you.</i>

155
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,667
<i>And I also joined work
where you used to work.</i>

156
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:14,583
<i>This is the best way to
keep an eye on anyone.</i>

157
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,917
<i>But even after being so
close to you for months,</i>

158
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,750
<i>I didn't find out anything
about your boyfriend.</i>

159
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,208
<i>And then...</i>

160
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:30,750
<i>One day I overheard your conversation
with your friends.</i>

161
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,958
<i>And my suspicion, doubt,
was completely cleared.</i>

162
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:37,458
<i>That you don't have a boyfriend.</i>

163
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,542
<i>That day I was very happy.</i>

164
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,042
<i>Because my path was absolutely clear.</i>

165
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,958
After that, you went to Bangalore.

166
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,583
And I did too.

167
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,667
Even though I had so many
qualifications and experience,

168
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,875
those fools made me a clerk.

169
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:56,000
One has to make small
sacrifices in love.

170
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,500
After that, wherever
you went I followed you

171
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,792
You used to not see me,
but I saw you every day.

172
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,833
I often tried to talk to you.

173
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,250
But every time I came close to you,

174
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,833
I would lose my self-confidence.

175
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,250
-You were crazy.
-And I still am.

176
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,667
Look while telling you all these stories,
I forgot to ask you about food.

177
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,167
I'll serve your dinner.

178
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,500
I am not hungry.

179
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:29,667
Please let me go.

180
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:34,625
<i>I have been your lover for decades</i>

181
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,625
<i>Whether you accept it</i>

182
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:43,208
<i>Whether you accept it or not</i>

183
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,708
I have loved you all my life.

184
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:51,500
The more I loved you, my desire
to love you grew even more.

185
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,500
I could not understand what to do.

186
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,708
How to talk to you?

187
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,708
Because if I don't talk to you
then how will I propose to you?

188
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:02,458
The problem was about experience of which
I didn't even have one percent.

189
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:03,958
It was first-time love after all.

190
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,583
But doesn't matter.

191
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:06,875
Now you're here.

192
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,083
I'll learn from you how to propose.

193
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,875
What nonsense are you talking?

194
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,667
Have you gone mad, Yash?

195
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,333
Everyone goes mad in love.

196
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,667
Philosophy also says...
Love is madness, Madness is love.

197
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,542
I've had enough of you!

198
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,500
How could you imagine that I...

199
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,958
I Natasha Kapoor will fall in
love with a psycho like you?

200
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,250
Who are you?
What is your status?

201
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,292
You were always a fool.

202
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,792
And now after kidnapping me,
you've become a criminal as well.

203
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,542
Forget about love... you're
not even fit for my friendship.

204
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,750
You will stoop so low Yash,
I could never imagine this.

205
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:48,750
You are a criminal.

206
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,625
Look, I'll give you
one more chance.

207
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,750
Let me go, otherwise you can't
imagine what I will do to you.

208
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
Love me!

209
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,750
That is all I want.

210
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,333
Love?

211
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:05,833
And that too with you?

212
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,125
I hate you.
And I will always hate you.

213
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,375
Think with a cool mind.

214
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,000
Try and understand me.

215
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,625
Slowly, you will start liking me.

216
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:18,958
And one day,

217
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,875
you will fall in love with me.

218
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,292
That day will never come.

219
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,625
<i>You said no to my love but
you fell in love with me.</i>

220
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:30,000
<i>You wanted to say no
But you said yes to love me.</i>

221
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,542
That day will come.
It will definitely come.

222
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,375
That moment will surely come when you
will come to me and say,

223
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:40,583
And I will hold you in my arms
and say,

224
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,125
I love you too Natasha darling.

225
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:43,833
You know what, Yash?

226
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,625
You need to visit a good doctor.

227
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,458
Now you are my doctor and my cure.

228
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:53,292
That's why I brought you here.

229
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:58,167
Let's talk about love later.

230
00:24:58,292 --> 00:24:59,125
First dinner.

231
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:01,083
It's time for your dinner.

232
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,708
<i>This evening is lively</i>

233
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:09,833
<i>It's getting me intoxicated</i>

234
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:13,167
<i>A string is pulling me</i>

235
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,833
<i>Pulling me towards you</i>

236
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,333
Today's dinner is of your liking.

237
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,792
Since I found out that
you're non vegetarian,

238
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,208
even I decided to become non-vegetarian.

239
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:30,000
And then... I stopped eating veg food.

240
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:30,917
As the saying goes...

241
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,167
Whatever you like I will do.

242
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,625
If you say the day is night,
then I will say it is night too.

243
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,875
Come, let's have dinner.

244
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,125
Oh!

245
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,542
I forgot to untie your hands.

246
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,250
And now I am going to untie you.

247
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,833
But, please...

248
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,083
and one more time, please.

249
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,417
Don't try to run away from here.

250
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,792
There are dangerous animals outside.

251
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,250
And if something happens
to you then I swear to my mother...

252
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,917
Romeo-Juliet.

253
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,458
I'll have to kill myself as well.

254
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:19,542
I didn't think, if I don't
untie you how will you eat?

255
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:23,042
You see, I am too excited today.

256
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:28,208
And in my excitement,
I often get careless.

257
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,083
Look... I forgot again.

258
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:36,875
You take a drink before dinner. Right?

259
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,625
See I told you I am too excited.

260
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,000
I ordered wine, and
forgot to give you.

261
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,750
Your favourite wine.

262
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,667
It is said that, wine has
magnesium and calcium,

263
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,875
which is very good
for skin and bones.

264
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,875
And drinking this, does not
give you blood pressure also.

265
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:06,583
Drinking too much is
bad for health.

266
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,125
But...

267
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:13,292
I often tend to drink
more, because of your love.

268
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,375
Whenever I miss you,

269
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:20,208
a siren goes off in my head.

270
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,667
And then to stop it,
I need an entire bottle.

271
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,500
And then I am not in my senses.

272
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,333
You are making a big mistake.

273
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,333
You don't know the consequences.

274
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,542
Lovers are never scared
of the consequences.

275
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,625
I don't love you!

276
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:42,000
You know, for the past couple of years,
I have been drinking alone.

277
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,333
This is the first time that,

278
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,208
I am drinking with a girl.

279
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,875
And that too with you.

280
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,375
How lucky, right?

281
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,292
What did you do?

282
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,375
If you were not in the mood to drink,
you could've told me.

283
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,208
Why did you have to
break the bottle?

284
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,875
I had ordered only one.

285
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,167
If you get the mood to drink at night,

286
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,833
then from where will I get it?

287
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:13,500
Oh no! Now I'll have
to clean up this mess.

288
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:26,042
Some people believe that
breaking of glass is bad luck.

289
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,167
And some believe it's good luck.

290
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,750
Different people, different beliefs.

291
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,583
What do you believe?

292
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:39,250
Bro, it is good luck for me.
Because you're with me.

293
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:43,250
<i>You're with me
I am with you</i>

294
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:47,000
<i>Should I look at you or love you.</i>

295
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,333
Oh... You are really short-tempered.

296
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:55,042
Even doctors say, it's not
good for health.

297
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:56,875
This temper.

298
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:01,250
Now however angry you are,
quickly get it out of your system.

299
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,250
And get rid of it.

300
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,542
I meant this temper.

301
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,167
Take a deep breath in,

302
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,875
and now let it out.

303
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Like this.

304
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,250
This is how it's done in Yoga too.

305
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:21,333
<i>If your anger is so beautiful</i>

306
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:24,583
<i>How will you look in love</i>

307
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:26,208
How will you look in approval?

308
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:31,958
But as they say,
patience brings sweet rewards.

309
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:38,208
Come on, get up.

310
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,000
Let's have dinner first.

311
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,667
Come, get up.

312
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,375
You must be hungry. Come.

313
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,833
Come on.

314
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,042
<i>Dear spring shower flowers</i>

315
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,792
<i>My sweetheart has arrived</i>

316
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,875
<i>My sweetheart has arrived</i>

317
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:00,542
Sit here!

318
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:06,458
After dinner, we'll drink coffee
and have a long chat.

319
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:11,542
And I'll sit in front of you...
Here.

320
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:13,875
Oh shit!

321
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,333
I forgot to wash my hands before eating.

322
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:18,958
Doesn't matter. You start eating.

323
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:21,667
Eating hot food is satisfying.

324
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:24,292
I'll be right back, Okay.

325
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:27,958
<i>I keep on singing the songs of</i>

326
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,583
<i>A beating heart in someone's thoughts</i>

327
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:34,875
You see, whenever
you're in front of me...

328
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,667
something makes me very nervous.

329
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:43,292
And when a person is nervous,
he starts to forget things.

330
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,708
He gets afraid and acts weirdly.

331
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,583
You haven't started eating yet.

332
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:56,458
You are waiting for me.

333
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,042
Come on, let's eat together.

334
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,667
I'll serve you.
What will you have first?

335
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,792
You forget a lot.

336
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,167
And I don't forgive first mistakes.

337
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,292
What have you done, Natasha?

338
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,000
Leave it.

339
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:23,167
I was talking about love to you.
But you shed my blood.

340
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,875
-What are you doing?
-Bloody mental.

341
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:25,833
Please don't go.

342
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:29,125
Stop, Natasha. Please stop.

343
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,917
You cannot run from here.

344
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,000
There's no point in trying.

345
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,708
Come back to me!

346
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:42,917
<i>Wait behind, talk to me for a while</i>

347
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,917
<i>Then leave</i>

348
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,208
<i>Because the weather is beautiful</i>

349
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,875
<i>Stop</i>

350
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:52,708
<i>Stop</i>

351
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,167
Boss, it must be paining a lot.

352
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,500
Yes a little

353
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,583
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

354
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:12,583
Yes, Tommy.

355
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,875
It's paining.

356
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,375
It's paining here.

357
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,958
Why did you have to do all this?

358
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,250
Look...

359
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,000
how much blood you have shed.

360
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:45,292
Honestly. I didn't mind at all.

361
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:50,417
-For love people even give up their life.
-Right.

362
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,250
I have only shed some blood.

363
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:57,458
Now, do you believe me how
much I love you?

364
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:59,458
Believe me.

365
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,083
In this whole world no one will ever
love you as much I do.

366
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,125
I will only give you love and more love.

367
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:12,750
Oh yes, I forgot to tell
you about this man.

368
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,500
-This is Tommy.
-Yes.

369
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:15,625
My bodyguard.

370
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,750
Do you know why his name is Tommy?

371
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,375
Because he's more loyal than a dog.

372
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,875
When the time comes,
he can give up his life for me,

373
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,083
and even take someone's life.

374
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:41,917
Do you know, once a mad
dog bit me on the road?

375
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,625
Do you know what Tommy did?

376
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,875
He bit that dog until he died.

377
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:49,750
Poor dog.

378
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,875
Before dying he couldn't
even see his family members.

379
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,875
Are you trying to scare me?

380
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:58,208
No, I was only introducing Tommy to you.

381
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,375
That was a very bad introduction.

382
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,250
Natasha didn't like
your introduction.

383
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:12,167
Doesn't matter.

384
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,042
Natasha will become your friend.

385
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,708
Give her some time.

386
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,333
Now go.

387
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:26,708
Okay listen, let both of us talk
about something else.

388
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,125
I'll give you an offer.

389
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:33,750
Let me go, and in exchange I am
willing to give you money.

390
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,708
As much as you want.

391
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:48,667
One who changes is not a true lover.

392
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,458
And the love that can be
bought is not love at all.

393
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,375
Applause me.

394
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:59,125
You want to buy my love with money.

395
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,917
I don't think you know
the definition of true love.

396
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,917
Today, I want to show you
the intensity of my love.

397
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,792
-Come on.
-Leave my hand.

398
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,167
Where are you taking me?

399
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:28,625
<i>Bridge this distance</i>

400
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:34,708
<i>That exist between us</i>

401
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,375
<i>And give our love</i>

402
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:47,417
<i>A beautiful twist</i>

403
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:12,125
<i>Bridge this distance
That exists between us</i>

404
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:18,542
<i>And give our love a beautiful twist.</i>

405
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:25,708
<i>Bridge this distance
That exists between us</i>

406
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:32,417
<i>And give our love
a beautiful twist</i>

407
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:37,083
<i>Come in my arms</i>

408
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,125
<i>And dwell in my breath</i>

409
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:46,458
<i>And leave the rest up to me</i>

410
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:52,542
<i>Bridge this distance
That exists between us</i>

411
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:59,292
<i>And give our love
A beautiful twist</i>

412
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:19,083
Look, this room has been specially
designed for you...

413
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:23,083
All four sides only you.

414
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,708
Hope you like my collection of photos.

415
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:29,875
Whenever I miss you,

416
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,167
I automatically I come here.

417
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:37,167
I get a strange peace here.

418
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,000
It seems like, you will come
out of one of these pictures

419
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:44,542
and hug me tight.

420
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:52,375
<i>The desire for you in my eyes</i>

421
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:58,625
<i>Does not leave
What to do?</i>

422
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:05,875
<i>Without you by my side</i>

423
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:12,625
<i>My nights are restless
What to do?</i>

424
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:16,708
<i>My obsession</i>

425
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:22,500
<i>And your aloofness my sweetheart</i>

426
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:25,917
<i>Come in my arms</i>

427
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,250
<i>And dwell in my breath</i>

428
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:35,292
<i>And leave the rest up to me</i>

429
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:41,542
<i>Bridge this distance
That exists between us</i>

430
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:48,208
<i>And give our love a beautiful twist</i>

431
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:54,958
<i>Bridge this distance
That exists between us</i>

432
00:39:55,833 --> 00:40:02,167
<i>And give our love a beautiful twist</i>

433
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,458
When I got my first salary,

434
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,083
I bought this Taj Mahal for you.

435
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,958
A symbol of love.

436
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,042
King Shahjahan had built it
for his wife Mumtaz.

437
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:16,417
Natasha,

438
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,250
even I love you as much as

439
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,833
King Shahjahan loved Mumtaz.

440
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:26,958
And since then, whenever I got my salary,

441
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,250
I bought a gift for you.

442
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:31,750
For myself I bought shirts
worth 200 rupees...

443
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,458
But for you,

444
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:35,750
I bought these expensive clothes.

445
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:38,667
I thought when you wear these,

446
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,542
my desires will be fulfilled.

447
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,333
And look. A Diamond ring.

448
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,667
And I am completely sure...

449
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:51,708
one day I will be engaged to you.

450
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,958
Every night, I decorate
this bed with flowers myself.

451
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,917
And in the morning,
I change the bed-sheet.

452
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:35,125
I've waited a long
time for your love.

453
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,667
Now, do you understand
how much I love you?

454
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,667
And you want to buy
my love with money.

455
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,000
This was your second mistake.

456
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,042
First of all, you shouldn't
have tried to run from here.

457
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,542
You broke my trust, you betrayed me.

458
00:41:57,167 --> 00:42:00,500
Do you know, how difficult
it is to win someone's trust?

459
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,458
And how easy it is
to break that trust.

460
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,750
It takes only a moment
to break someone's trust.

461
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,375
But I love you a lot.

462
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:27,250
And I am sure that exist...

463
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:29,875
I definitely exist somewhere,

464
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,500
In the corner of your heart.

465
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,917
After seeing and knowing all this
you must be reassured.

466
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,042
That how much I love you.

467
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,208
Natasha...

468
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,542
So today, I have finally
proposed to you.

469
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,250
I am sorry, Yash, I hurt you...

470
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:27,750
The wounds on your heart
are much more painful.

471
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:41,125
<i>Crossing all the limits of madness</i>

472
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:47,958
<i>I'll love you and see the outcome</i>

473
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:54,708
<i>I know my sweetheart</i>

474
00:43:55,333 --> 00:44:01,500
<i>One cannot be scared in love</i>

475
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:08,083
<i>With you starts my life</i>

476
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,167
<i>My sweetheart</i>

477
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:14,458
<i>Come in my arms</i>

478
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:18,000
<i>And dwell in my breath</i>

479
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:23,750
<i>And leave the rest up to me</i>

480
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:30,333
<i>Bridge this distance
That exists between us</i>

481
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:36,875
<i>And give our love a beautiful twist</i>

482
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:43,958
<i>Bridge this distance
That exists between us</i>

483
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:50,500
<i>And give our love a beautiful twist</i>

484
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,333
See...

485
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,417
This is how friendship begins.

486
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:08,833
At first you didn't like me at all.

487
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,833
And now you are eating from my hands.

488
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:16,833
When we'll spend more time together...

489
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,667
you will also fall in love with me.

490
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,625
I am in no hurry.

491
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,292
You can take all the time you want.

492
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,542
I will wait.

493
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:39,375
Yash.

494
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:44,792
I think you are right and I was
the one who couldn't understand you.

495
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:50,000
I wish, I had seen your love
for me in your eyes before.

496
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,333
Maybe our love story would
have been different.

497
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:57,000
Now see, you've been in love
with me for the past three years,

498
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,542
and I never even realized it.

499
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:03,208
You wanted to come closer to me,
and I pushed myself away.

500
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:07,250
But suddenly falling
in love like this...

501
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,917
I am not able to take
the right decision.

502
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,875
I want to understand you.
Know you.

503
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:18,083
Even I want to love you,
as much as you love me.

504
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,292
-Really?
-Yes.

505
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:23,292
Because I think, our
destination is the same.

506
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:27,000
That's why in these three years, you
didn't find anyone else like me.

507
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:30,958
And even I didn't find a perfect guy.

508
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:34,083
You didn't get married,
you're a bachelor.

509
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,000
And even I am unmarried.

510
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:48,833
It was rightly said by a great man.

511
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:56,750
No one can ever
understand a woman... no one.

512
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:58,750
You're lying to me.

513
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,750
I said, wherever you went, I went too.

514
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,292
Why?

515
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,292
Are you shocked?

516
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,000
Don't you want to know,
who made you a widow?

517
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:19,125
And who killed your husband?

518
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:32,625
Gentlemen,

519
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:37,208
those who dream, never have an easy life.

520
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:40,000
We cannot appear good to everyone.

521
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:44,375
But we are the best,
for those who trust us.

522
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:50,000
We cannot change the future,
but we can make our present better.

523
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:55,375
As the saying goes, those who take
the first step reach their destination.

524
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,625
But this project involves a lot of risks.

525
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:06,708
Mr. Ajit Bhalla, you want to do business
and also scared of taking risks.

526
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,375
Whereas the first step
of business, is a risk.

527
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:14,417
As they say, those who never
take risks, have never done business.

528
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,583
Mr. Rahul, this is no time to take a risk.

529
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,042
So you tell us, what is
the right time to take a risk?

530
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:24,333
Because no time is bad for a good deed.

531
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:28,417
The only bad thing is, the wrong
decision taken at the right time.

532
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,167
Look, Natasha,
I am a very simple man.

533
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:43,667
Right since my childhood up
till today, I have only worked.

534
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:47,333
I don't like to twist my words,
so I'll come straight to the point.

535
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:51,000
You might feel bad hearing this
but, I can't help it.

536
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:53,542
What is the matter, Rahul?

537
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:58,625
Natasha, I want to remove you
from the job of my personal secretary.

538
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:03,500
Because I want to...

539
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,208
make you my life partner.

540
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,708
You want to...

541
00:49:11,292 --> 00:49:12,917
Like this so suddenly.

542
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:17,708
What is all this?

543
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,167
Okay, fine.

544
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,500
We can romance and date
after marriage as well.

545
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,625
We have our entire life
to romance with each other.

546
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:27,667
But, if there is anyone else
in your life, then you can say no.

547
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,750
And I swear I won't feel bad.

548
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:33,083
But, I want you to say yes.

549
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:03,500
No!

550
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:17,750
Natasha, you haven't changed yet.

551
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:20,792
Don't tell me you're going
to sleep in these clothes.

552
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,542
Come on, Natasha, don't be so formal.

553
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,333
This is very old school.

554
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:31,875
First, lift the veil, then watch
each other, and talk for hours.

555
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:32,958
Isn't it? Right?

556
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:36,208
And anyway, we already know each other.

557
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,625
But this is our culture.

558
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,583
And we shouldn't forget it.

559
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:43,125
No matter how modern we become.

560
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,042
This is what I love about you.

561
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:51,333
My love, this is how a wife should be.

562
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,042
The moon's out now.

563
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:06,125
You're looking so gorgeous today,

564
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,333
that I want to give you everything.

565
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:17,375
Now who is calling this late?

566
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,667
<i>I want to talk to you alone.</i>

567
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:33,667
Hello.

568
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:37,917
<i>Are you going to celebrate your
wedding night with your wife?</i>

569
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:40,500
Who is this?

570
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,792
And what is this way
to call at this late hour?

571
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,083
So she finally trapped you,

572
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,208
like she trapped so many others.

573
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,958
Who are you talking about?

574
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:54,667
The one who's now your wife.

575
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:01,708
Your wife's boyfriend.

576
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:05,667
Stop this rubbish.

577
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,542
I think you dialed the wrong number.

578
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,458
I am hanging up.

579
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,917
You're in a big hurry to celebrate
your wedding night, Mr. Rahul Kapoor.

580
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,792
How do you know me?

581
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:21,667
I know all of Natasha's lovers
very well.

582
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:25,708
And you're her husband. Her sweetheart.

583
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:30,000
Do you know what's the
difference between you and me?

584
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:32,208
What?

585
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:37,083
I am her past and you're her present.

586
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:40,458
Why? Don't you believe me?

587
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:43,708
Doesn't matter. Enjoy your life.

588
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:49,250
But I will tell you one thing,
she is very...hot!

589
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,625
What proof do you have?

590
00:52:56,167 --> 00:53:01,208
Some beautiful memories and
beautiful moments spent with her,

591
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:04,583
which are captured in some photographs.

592
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,708
Can I see those photographs now?

593
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:09,500
How long will it take
you to come down to the gate?

594
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:12,208
I'll only wait for 5 minutes for you.

595
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:14,958
Wait there. I'm coming right away.

596
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:22,583
Natasha, I'll be back in five minutes.

597
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:24,750
Where are you going now?

598
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,500
As I said, I'll be right back.

599
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,625
Congratulations on the wedding, sir.

600
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,583
Yeah.

601
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:01,375
Did anyone come here?

602
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:04,958
No, sir. Nobody came here.

603
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:18,125
Marriage. She is mine!

604
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:21,667
She's mine. Natasha is mine.

605
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,917
You killed my Rahul.

606
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:05,625
Yes, I killed him.

607
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,167
Because he came between us.

608
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,542
Just think,
he didn't wait even for a minute,

609
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,083
he directly married you.

610
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:19,375
So I got rid of him from the way.

611
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,250
You killed Rahul.

612
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:25,792
How could you do such a thing?

613
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:28,000
What do you mean by how?

614
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:30,333
I killed him with my own hands.

615
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:33,583
You killed my Rahul?

616
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,917
Yes, believe me love.

617
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,375
Although he was in
slight pain while dying.

618
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:44,333
But as it's said everything
is fair in love and war.

619
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:46,875
Yeah, right.

620
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:55,250
Anyway, forget it. That is the past.

621
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,167
Okay listen,

622
00:56:00,042 --> 00:56:01,708
let's play a game together.

623
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,750
Everything for you is a game, Yash.

624
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:15,625
Through this game,
we'll get to know each other better.

625
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:22,125
We'll each say one good point about
each other, and one bad point.

626
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,542
We'll try to rectify the bad point.

627
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:29,333
And the good point...
well, that's already good.

628
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:33,125
Okay, first you start.

629
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,750
The good point about
you is that you love me a lot.

630
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,917
You are very caring.

631
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:46,125
And the bad point about you
is that you don't listen to anyone.

632
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:48,667
You only do as you wish.

633
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,333
Okay. Fine.

634
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:58,958
From today, I'll listen
to you and won't do as I please.

635
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,667
Now my turn.

636
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:05,333
The good point about
you, is you have a clear heart.

637
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:10,625
And the bad point...
you are very stubborn.

638
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,500
You don't accept my love.

639
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:16,417
I'll accept it, Yash.

640
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:17,792
When?

641
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,250
I will.

642
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,875
We should've been married now.

643
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:23,625
We should've small kids who would call

644
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:27,583
you mom and me dad.

645
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:32,625
I want to create our own
little world with you, Natasha.

646
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,167
We will create that world, Yash.

647
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:40,500
Have faith in me. Believe me.

648
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,750
Faith?

649
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:46,750
How can I believe you?

650
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,167
How?

651
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:52,833
Come close to me.

652
00:57:58,917 --> 00:57:59,750
More close.

653
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,583
A little closer.

654
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,083
Very close.

655
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,375
<i>When in love why be afraid</i>

656
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:41,542
<i>When in love why be afraid</i>

657
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,458
<i>It's just love and not a crime</i>

658
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:50,042
<i>It's just love and not a crime</i>

659
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:53,000
<i>Why sigh in sadness</i>

660
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:57,292
<i>This boy is so crazy</i>

661
00:58:57,917 --> 00:59:01,958
<i>It's so difficult
To make him understand</i>

662
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:06,542
<i>That slowly the heart gets fonder</i>

663
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:10,958
<i>Then only one falls in love</i>

664
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:15,083
<i>Love has blossomed,
Feelings have been expressed</i>

665
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:18,208
<i>Then why is the heart
Afraid of commitment</i>

666
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:21,042
<i>The heart says the path is difficult</i>

667
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:24,708
<i>And it does not know its destination</i>

668
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:31,500
Wow... you seem to
be in a good mood today.

669
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:34,083
Here's your tea.

670
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:40,750
Yash, can I ask you a question?

671
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,417
Yes, go ahead.

672
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,917
Who else is there in your family?

673
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,833
Mother, father,
brother, sister, or are you alone?

674
00:59:49,042 --> 00:59:50,833
My parents are divorced.

675
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:55,292
My father remarried
and left this country.

676
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:57,292
I have stepbrother and sister.

677
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,542
They live with my father in foreign.

678
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:05,042
I loved my mother a lot.
I was very close to her.

679
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:10,042
You know, it was my mother's desire
that I get married.

680
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:14,917
Daily she would show me a photograph
of a new girl and ask me...

681
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:18,083
how is this girl, how is that girl.

682
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:22,958
I would reject every girl.

683
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,042
Do you know why?

684
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,542
Because I love you.

685
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,042
Then one day I told mom about you.

686
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:36,625
She was very happy thinking
that you'll become her daughter-in-law.

687
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,042
She wanted to meet you.

688
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:40,375
But I said no.

689
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:44,833
I thought when you say yes to me,
then I will introduce you to her.

690
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:49,083
Waiting in anticipation, mother fell sick,

691
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,792
and one day she passed away.

692
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:59,250
Before dying,
she took my hand in hers and said...

693
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:05,167
son, marry only the girl you truly love.

694
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:09,042
And when that happens, my soul
will rest in peace.

695
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:16,125
Natasha, your one
yes can change our lives.

696
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,625
We will leave this country.

697
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,042
We'll start a new life
in a different country.

698
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:26,042
I need some time to think, Yash.

699
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:28,208
And I want money.

700
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:30,917
The rations are finished.
I've to buy rations for a week.

701
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,417
And I am also taking your car.

702
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:34,667
Okay, fine.

703
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:37,458
I'll be right back.

704
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:15,500
These are your favourite
flowers, just for you.

705
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:21,000
Come and cut the cake.

706
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,667
Today will be the first
time in so many years,

707
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:28,250
that I'll be celebrating
your birthday with you.

708
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,500
I completely forgot that
today is my birthday, Yash.

709
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,875
I wasn't expecting any of this.

710
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,000
No...you first.

711
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:44,292
Today I want to give
you another surprise gift.

712
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:50,875
And if you're giving it, then it
must be really special.

713
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:52,167
Come on.

714
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,833
Come.

715
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,292
Look, who is here to meet you.

716
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:19,875
What? He's Mr. Bhalla.

717
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:24,667
You recognised this rascal rightly.

718
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:29,917
Remember, that day
after Rahul's death,

719
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,833
he came to meet you at the office.

720
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:40,083
Rahul has left a very big responsibility.

721
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:42,125
This huge business empire.

722
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:46,750
I am there.

723
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:48,750
I will support you.

724
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:52,083
Together we will run this company.

725
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,417
Believe me, Natasha, believe me.

726
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,917
What are you doing?

727
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:06,583
Try to understand me without me,
you are nothing.

728
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:11,333
Natasha, look at me.
Look at the feelings inside me!

729
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:12,542
I love you a lot.

730
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:15,583
I can give you everything, that
Rahul could give you.

731
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:18,042
Please try to understand me,
Natasha. Please.

732
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:20,417
I can get rid of your loneliness.

733
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:22,792
Come to your senses, Mr. Bhalla.

734
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:28,292
I am the wife of your friend.

735
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:16,542
Bhalla? But he... here?

736
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,208
He was...

737
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,250
He's the one who made you cry.

738
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:28,458
He's paying for your
priceless drops of tears.

739
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,167
He's a big rascal.

740
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:32,958
He lusts you.

741
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,542
And look at his guts...

742
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:40,042
He tried to force himself on you.

743
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:42,417
That day he swayed.

744
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:45,333
He wasn't drunk that he swayed.

745
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:52,500
He had full plans,
to make you his mistress.

746
01:05:55,792 --> 01:05:58,875
Because he is already married.

747
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:01,458
He couldn't have made you his wife.

748
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,167
Bastard! He's a rascal.

749
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:15,792
See... my darling is here to see you.

750
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:19,625
Walking on her own feet.

751
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:22,333
Natasha, you're here, Natasha.

752
01:06:22,417 --> 01:06:25,417
Look what this man has done to me.

753
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:28,417
I don't even know this man.

754
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,875
He comes here three times a day.

755
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:34,833
And shows your photograph
and asks me to say sorry to it.

756
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:38,167
And even after saying sorry,
he beats me up.

757
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:40,167
Mother's swear...

758
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:43,167
Hey... say sorry to madam.

759
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,542
-Natasha...
-Don't complain about me.

760
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:51,250
Natasha, please forgive me.
I made a very big mistake.

761
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:54,500
I am a lowlife,
a rascal, and a cheap man.

762
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,958
Please forgive me, Natasha.

763
01:06:57,083 --> 01:07:00,625
Your mother's swear...
Apologise from your heart.

764
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,292
Until madam doesn't forgive you.
I won't leave you.

765
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:07,708
Natasha, please forgive me.

766
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,250
Let me go home, Natasha.

767
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,875
My wife and children
must be waiting for me.

768
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:17,917
Please forgive me, Natasha.

769
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:20,250
Yash, I forgive him.

770
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,708
Mr. Bhalla, I forgive you.

771
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,375
Then he should be set free.

772
01:07:28,292 --> 01:07:32,292
Tommy, untie him.

773
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:47,833
But before he leaves,
we'll celebrate his freedom.

774
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:52,875
And this rascal, will entertain us.

775
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:54,917
You will, right?

776
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,083
Yes, of course. I will.

777
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:19,917
<i>Oh my queen who dwells in my dreams</i>

778
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:23,792
<i>Come in my arms and fall in love with me</i>

779
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:27,917
<i>I am your sweetheart,
have mercy on me</i>

780
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:30,417
<i>Listen to my heart</i>

781
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:34,332
<i>It is crazy about you</i>

782
01:08:34,957 --> 01:08:35,832
<i>I admit</i>

783
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:39,750
<i>Don't stop my path
I've to go home</i>

784
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:44,417
<i>What excuse will I give mom-dad</i>

785
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,707
<i>Try to understand sweetheart
I trust you</i>

786
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:52,917
<i>I am scared don't keep
Touching me again and again</i>

787
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:56,917
<i>I am scared don't keep
Touching me again and again</i>

788
01:08:57,082 --> 01:09:01,667
<i>I am scared don't keep
Touching me again and again</i>

789
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:05,792
<i>Where are you going</i>

790
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:10,125
<i>Leaving me behind</i>

791
01:09:10,207 --> 01:09:14,332
<i>I cannot live without you</i>

792
01:09:14,542 --> 01:09:19,457
<i>Honestly I will die</i>

793
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:44,917
Wow, Bhalla,
you have won everyone's heart.

794
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,207
You can go.

795
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,582
Now can I go.

796
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:51,457
I'll go?

797
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,542
When you reach do write a letter to me.

798
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:00,792
Of course.

799
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,542
He is dead, this rascal

800
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,625
And anyway he wasn't
worthy of staying alive.

801
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:40,000
How could I spare someone
who tried to force himself on you?

802
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:46,417
I was keeping him alive,
so he could apologise to you.

803
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:51,708
What have you done, Yash?

804
01:10:51,792 --> 01:10:53,875
People make mistakes.

805
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,208
And don't think about the consequences.

806
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:01,417
Misbehaving with you.

807
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:07,875
He shouldn't have done that.

808
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:13,750
Enough of waiting.

809
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:16,292
The moment has come to decide, Natasha.

810
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,583
I loved you so much.

811
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:21,125
What didn't I do for you.

812
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:23,208
The proof is in front of you.

813
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:28,042
And now I don't know what else to do,

814
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,625
that will make you realise that
I can do anything for you.

815
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:35,542
To win your love, I can cross any limits.

816
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:40,083
Even after doing everything
You wouldn't be mine.

817
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,583
I cannot live without you.

818
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,375
And you...

819
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,875
don't want to be mine.

820
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:52,208
I am fed up of this life.

821
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:55,833
I am tired of this dilemma.

822
01:11:58,542 --> 01:11:59,542
Take this.

823
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:05,167
Kill me! And finish this matter for ever.

824
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:07,292
Get rid of me.

825
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,458
I cannot kill you, Yash.

826
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:41,458
You truly love me.

827
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,167
And I cannot kill my lover.

828
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:51,708
This gun was empty.

829
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,167
I was just testing you.

830
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,792
I wanted to see if you
shoot me or not.

831
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:05,125
Congratulations.
You passed this test.

832
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,958
How long will you keep testing me, Yash?

833
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:12,750
I am ready to go through every trial.

834
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,167
But we'll waste our
entire life like this.

835
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:25,833
To make me yours, you made
so many sacrifices

836
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:32,042
And I know, I have realized that,
in this life or any other lifetime,

837
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:35,042
no one can love me more than you.

838
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:37,125
You know, I am very lucky.

839
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:42,958
And I am fortunate that
you made me realise this fact.

840
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:48,458
Take me in your arms, Yash.
I love you.

841
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,083
I don't want to lose you.
I love you.

842
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,417
I really love you, Yash.

843
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:09,250
Listen.

844
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:12,542
Now tell me?

845
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:17,708
Would you prefer biting a bullet
or a wedding sweet?

846
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:20,958
Come on, Yash,
let's get married tomorrow.

847
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:23,208
Engagement today and
marriage tomorrow.

848
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,458
Think about it.

849
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:28,208
Will you be my slave?

850
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:30,667
Will you marry me?

851
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:37,417
Your mother's soul will rest in peace,

852
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,583
and her desire will also be fulfilled.

853
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:44,083
Yes! A hundred times yes!

854
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,667
I was eagerly waiting
for this moment, Natasha.

855
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:50,667
Natasha! I can't believe
you said yes to marry me.

856
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:52,792
I'll go crazy with this happiness.

857
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:55,833
Did you hear, Tommy?
Natasha has agreed to marry me.

858
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:59,417
Oh... sister-in-law, I am so happy.

859
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:03,667
-Let's celebrate, distribute sweets.
-Yes!

860
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,500
Natasha has said yes.

861
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:06,875
Yes!

862
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:08,292
Did you hear, Tommy?

863
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:09,750
Natasha and I will get married.

864
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,583
Let the wines flow.

865
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,792
Boss, there is one problem.

866
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:20,125
Now what problem?

867
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:23,000
Today is dry day then
how can we let the wines flow?

868
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:26,875
Alcohol.

869
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:45,625
<i>From here, from there</i>

870
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,083
<i>Wonder from where</i>

871
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,792
<i>Like this, like that</i>

872
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:50,250
<i>Anywhere we like</i>

873
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:58,375
<i>From here, from there</i>

874
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,875
<i>Wonder from where</i>

875
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:01,625
<i>Like this, like that</i>

876
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:03,083
<i>Anywhere we like</i>

877
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:06,375
<i>Whether it's slow or closed
Hot or cold</i>

878
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:11,792
<i>Need some chicken in snacks</i>

879
01:16:12,042 --> 01:16:14,250
<i>Come on, hurry up</i>

880
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:18,125
<i>Be it Friday or dry day
I want a drink</i>

881
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,333
<i>Bro</i>

882
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:27,083
<i>Be it Friday or dry day
I want a drink</i>

883
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:30,333
<i>Be it Friday or dry day
I want a drink</i>

884
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:33,500
<i>I want a drink every day</i>

885
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:38,292
<i>Be it Friday or dry day
I want a drink</i>

886
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:41,625
<i>Be it Friday or dry day
I want a drink</i>

887
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,375
<i>When you say I love you baby</i>

888
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:48,000
<i>My heart skips a beat</i>

889
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:51,167
<i>My heart starts beating fast
And I loose control</i>

890
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,708
<i>Listen to me, take a 'U' turn</i>

891
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:59,583
<i>Come close to me, unite with me</i>

892
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:07,917
<i>Oh my!</i>

893
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:26,292
<i>Be it any occasion or celebration</i>

894
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:29,750
<i>We will be fully charged and high</i>

895
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:35,875
<i>From this 31st to next 31st.</i>

896
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:39,125
<i>We'll continue drinking
without hesitation</i>

897
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:47,667
<i>We'll continue drinking
without hesitation</i>

898
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:52,000
<i>Be it cheap or expensive,
good or bad</i>

899
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:54,458
<i>I want a fish, mutton, egg</i>

900
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:57,875
<i>I want it</i>

901
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:02,875
<i>Be it Friday or Dry day
I want a drink</i>

902
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,792
Pakya, come on!

903
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:06,750
Hey, Bro!

904
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:09,500
<i>Be it Friday or Dry day
I want a drink</i>

905
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:13,250
<i>Be it Friday or Dry day
I want a drink</i>

906
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,042
What?

907
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:19,208
<i>Be it Friday or Dry day
I want a drink</i>

908
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:21,708
Oh Lord!

909
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,917
Brother!

910
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,833
<i>Be it Friday or Dry day
I want a drink</i>

911
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:32,042
<i>Be it Friday or Dry day
I want a drink</i>

912
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:45,833
Boss, what happened?
Wake up, boss.

913
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:47,458
What happened to my, boss?

914
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:49,333
Boss!

915
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:54,833
What is this?

916
01:18:55,042 --> 01:18:57,042
Boss, Natasha is running away.

917
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:01,958
Come on.

918
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,917
Natasha!

919
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:27,375
Tommy, you go that way.

920
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:06,500
Natasha, come back!

921
01:20:12,792 --> 01:20:13,958
Natasha!

922
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:26,583
<i>Where are you hiding</i>

923
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:30,167
<i>I am restless for you</i>

924
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:35,333
<i>I am restless for you</i>

925
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:46,875
<i>Do not leave me and go just yet</i>

926
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:51,417
<i>My heart's not satisfied yet</i>

927
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:54,917
<i>Not yet satisfied</i>

928
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:00,625
<i>Don't go yet</i>

929
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,208
Natasha!

930
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:11,125
<i>The moon's half so is the night</i>

931
01:23:11,417 --> 01:23:13,917
<i>Our meeting's incomplete</i>

932
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:38,750
Caught you.

933
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:59,208
This is for ruining my life!

934
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:06,500
This is for killing my Rahul!

935
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:10,000
This is for kidnapping me!

936
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:45,125
Natasha, if you can't be mine, then
you won't be anyone else's either.

937
01:26:47,167 --> 01:26:52,875
<i>You and me
We are made for each other</i>

938
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:58,375
<i>You and me
We are made for each other</i>
