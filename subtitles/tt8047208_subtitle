00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,981
No...Searching!

3
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,961
-What happened?
-Nothing.

4
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,968
One of my clients has
a criminal network in Mattancherry.

5
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,263
Goondas will not work out.

6
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,800
Right! As Vasanth Comrade has
intervened, such things won't work.

7
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,774
-Vasanthetta had called up.
-Come inside and talk.

8
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,949
Vasanthetta called me sometime back.

9
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,853
He said that he's proceeding
towards the traced route and cut the line...

10
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,999
Good Lord! We're finished! Pappettan!

11
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,867
Convening a meeting at home after
your daughter eloped with somebody?

12
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,802
Come inside, we can talk.

13
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,808
Long ago, when l'd told that
she'd the tendency to elope,

14
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,813
his wife rebuked me for
talking ill of her daughter!

15
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,182
l'll give you a whack!
Take off your hand!

16
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,287
-Call the Police!-Sit down here.

17
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,956
Did you come here to tarnish our name?

18
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,850
ls what l'm saying tarnishing?!

19
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,116
Please talk softly

20
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,293
lt wouldn't matter if he was a
good and handsome guy!

21
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,892
He neither has education nor money!

22
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,193
So dark is his colour and
so ugly is his face!

23
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,295
Oh God! May You protect
our girl from any physical abuse!

24
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,178
You've framed and kept his photo!!

25
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,384
Only if she doesn't elope,
it's a wonder!

26
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,413
Seeing this rascal only,
she's learning it - Bloody love!!

27
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,851
Don't gape...Pick up the call.

28
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,297
Tell me, Vasantha!

29
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:08,793
Really?

30
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,965
Thank you, thank you, Vasantha!

31
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,108
He found her!
On seeing Vasanthan, he fled away.

32
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,784
Why don't we take her to a doctor?

33
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,716
As she nearly spent 5 - 8 hrs
with that boy!

34
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,793
Will you just shut up?

35
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,238
Don't ask her anything.
Let her rest for a while.

36
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,240
Go....You also go.

37
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,450
Let's take her to a psychologist!

38
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,986
Counselling will be good!

39
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,324
Yes, definitely!
Her mind must be totally disturbed!

40
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,299
Counselling will be a better solution.

41
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,398
l'm not mad.

42
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,804
Who told you falling in love is madness?

43
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,700
Then?

44
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,967
lt's just a counselling, dear!

45
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,076
Then, you carry on, doctor!
l'm ready.

46
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,812
We shall talk about love then!

47
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,441
Have you fallen in love, doctor?

48
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,983
l had such feelings towards a few,
but nothing worked out.

49
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,989
So you bought the ticket
but not watched the show, right?

50
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,498
As l've no experience, l ask you.

51
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,767
What's the actual feel of it?

52
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,764
Leaving your parents who raised you
with love and care for about 20 years,

53
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,405
for the sake of an intense love
that too with a stranger...

54
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,176
l don't understand why is that...

55
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,972
The average lifespan of a human
is around 60 years, right?

56
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,879
So, this same stranger whom you said has to
live with us, till our death, for about 35 yrs.

57
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:13,218
-So, in that aspect l took a decision,
why they needlessly get tensed? - Right!

58
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,488
And if l could actually describe its feel..

59
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,387
then you would've discovered a
drug for that long back!

60
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,862
Have you read Romeo and Juliet?

61
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,334
Khalil Gibran's ''Broken Wings''?

62
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,866
Salman ikka's Pranayam?

63
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,334
-You have not read, is it? - No.

64
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,038
She reads lots of books, right?

65
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,601
Yes, her main hobbies are books and movies!

66
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,503
One of the books she'd read or a
cinema she'd watched...

67
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,244
...a passionate love story..

68
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:14,245
That story orthe characters in that story
must have obsessed deeply in her mind.

69
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,320
Well said! Tell them, Doctor.

70
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,217
l keep warning them from the beginning.

71
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:19,983
What?

72
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,456
lt's exactly a story! A fantastic story!

73
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,255
But it's not from any cinema or novel!

74
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,260
-But a true biography! - Pappettan....

75
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,090
Let me explain.

76
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,994
She has got an uncle! A Vagabond!

77
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,194
Her younger brother had a
reputed job in the Navy.

78
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,134
Loved a North lndian girl!

79
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,502
His brother-in-law was just 25 yrs old then!

80
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,470
That girl walked out on him!

81
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:45,242
But this fellow... since last many years,
keeps wandering with pangs of sorrow!

82
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,913
A national voyage!

83
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,321
His story is really an Epic Mahabharatham!
He's the real Valmiki (saint)!

84
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,891
Wow! A real love story
which is so inspiring...!

85
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:57,993
Where is he now?

86
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,330
After traversing through all the soil in lndia,
he's landing into Lakshadweep now.

177
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,102
Which idiot jumped?

178
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:07,843
Move aside.

179
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:26,197
Team DrC

180
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,444
Pull him.

181
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,709
Give your hand.

182
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,851
Anyway, thank you, sir!

183
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,720
This was a security exercise!
l mean mock drill!

184
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,064
Oh! As you were holding Navy's lD card,
l doubted you.

185
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,702
That was my old lD card!

186
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,865
lt's almost 11 yrs after being
discharged from the Navy!

187
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,971
-Welcome to Kavaratti!
- Thank you.

188
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:22,844
Let's move, sir!

189
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:28,126
-My shoes..-Thank you.

190
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,561
lt happens twice a year!
This security exercise is called as Gemini!

191
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,130
24 hours of programme!

192
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,593
Terrorists role is given to
Navy people or Coast guards!

193
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,701
They have to plant the dummy bombs in the
already decided spots within the stipulated
time,

194
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,135
and the Police will
prevent them from planting it.

195
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,203
One whom you had caught
now was a Navy man!

196
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:49,275
Have you arrived early?

197
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,740
- Yes, how was yourjourney?
-Good! Thank you.

198
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,250
Please hold this, sir.

199
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,588
Hello instructor!

200
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,855
You are a multifaceted personality!

201
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:02,790
Likely to get a Bharat award.
What an acting - shivering with fright!!

202
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,693
Whatever skill one may possess,
we ought to fear the sea.

203
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,861
But Doctor doesn't have
any fear of the Sea!!

204
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:13,127
She crossed 90 channel easily through a tiny
fishing boat and reached an island!

205
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,863
She's the Medical Superintendent here!
Dr. Sherin!

206
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:18,866
Come on, sir!

207
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,111
l need to change my wet dress!

208
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,279
Don't worry, we're going to the cottage!

209
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,678
ls it close by?

210
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,143
Here all places are very close by, sir!

211
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,980
The entire area would only take 30 mins in bike!
That's the size of this Kavaratti island!

212
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:32,646
Team DrC

213
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,793
Fasten the banner on top!

214
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,626
Where were you?
ls the work not yet complete?

215
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,164
No....got some more work.

216
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,131
What about the work you'd gone for?

217
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,963
Everything ok!

218
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,693
Please come and get acquainted
with these people.

219
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,628
They are Pushpa's children!

220
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,871
-Pushpa..?
- Pushpa is the name of a club here.

221
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,367
He's Shantanu sir! New Diving instructor!

222
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,575
Sir, did you jump from the ship
and swam across?

223
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,907
Actually, it was a blunder l made .
This Navy..

224
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,017
As soon as he arrived, he laid his head
before Gemini and dived into the sea,

225
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,685
And caught hold of a Navy man!

226
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,284
-He's Hussain!
- Sravu(Shark) Hussain!

227
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,180
Sravu is your dad!

228
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,850
He is working as a Fisheries officer!

229
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,955
He is Mohsin - a Panchayat member!

230
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,961
Moideen, Zakhariah, Akbar...
These guys do fishing and Politics!

231
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:17,892
Please come!

232
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,105
Hejoined on a Deputation for sports.

233
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,207
-How good is his voice?
- Not bad!! Bill up for 1000 Rs!

234
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,141
He's a Programme Director in All lndia Radio.

235
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,280
He raises the invoices in our names
on behalf of the announcers on contract basis.

236
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,276
At last, he himself imitates the
voice and usurps the money.

237
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,752
As if l bought 4 ships
with that usurped money!

238
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:37,345
Hi, l am Rajeev!

239
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,119
Shantanu! People call me Chandu!

240
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,860
Wow! Good voice!

241
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,290
l'll give you work frequently!

242
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,889
l will happily accept it.

243
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,630
Settle him in a room and come back.

244
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,742
Everybody is
Chettuva Shahjahan's fans here, right?

245
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,105
Yesudas is out ,
Chettuva Shahjahan is leading now.

246
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,218
What's your programme today?

247
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,281
l shall also come with you..okay.

248
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,023
Language here is nice to hear!

249
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,863
Language is Malayalam only

250
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,226
But when the inhabitants of the island
converse,
this is the slang!

251
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:27,067
A mix of Tamil, Malayalam and a
little bit of Arabic -called as Jeseri!

252
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,298
People living on shores find it hard
to live here in this island

253
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,405
lf an emergency comes,
they'll be in trouble!

254
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,479
Ship's arrival and departure depends
on the Almighty's schedule!

255
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,941
Why were you interested in coming here?

256
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,176
Believe this also as Almighty's schedule!
What do you say?

257
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,456
''Laksha''dweep (1 lakh lslands)
was falsely named by someone long ago!

258
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,315
Totally there are only 10-30 islands!

259
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,125
And only 10 islands have been inhabited!

260
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,160
But the distance from one island to another
is a ship's travel!

261
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,193
-When Cheraman Perumal converted his
religion..
- Who?

262
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,868
-You've not heard of Cheraman Perumal?
-No.

263
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,806
Erstwhile King of Kerala!

264
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,301
Oh, that Perumal...

265
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,003
Yeah, it's the 1000 yr old story!!

266
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,209
When Perumal converted to lslam
and had gone to Mecca,

267
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,850
Some loyal people in Malabar went
in search of him to bring him back!

268
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,155
After being stranded in the Sea, they
ultimately got landed up in some island here.

269
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,758
This is one of the stories how the
people began inhabit here.

270
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,156
May be due to Perumal's
religion conversion,

271
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,022
-All the inhabitants here are lslamics!
-l see!

272
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,166
What is this girl distributing?

273
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,162
ls it Cinema notice!

274
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:33,428
Cinema?
For Cinema, we've to travel 300 kms...

275
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,430
Upto Kochi!

276
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,936
Here all of us watch cinemas on T.V

277
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,816
This is Sir's cottage.
How is the location?

278
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,549
Breathtaking!

279
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,058
What about yourfamily?

280
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,160
-We're living separately!
- Why? What happened, sir?.

281
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,322
Nothing happened!

282
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,927
Only after marriage,
we can live together, right?

283
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,499
Oh you meant that!
Well, where is she living now? Hometown?

284
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,941
Yes...in some place!

285
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,445
-Have you distributed the notice?
-Yes.

286
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,316
My little sister, Duva!

287
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,284
Shantanu sir! New Diving lnstructor!

288
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,043
Greetings!

289
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,789
Wait, l shall also come along.

290
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,285
No...l need to go for tuition,

291
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,192
and give the injection.

292
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,397
Wait for 5 mins,
l'll get him settled and be back.

293
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,063
Nurse?

294
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,231
She was studying for MBBS in
Kozhikode Medical College.

295
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,801
After three years,
she discontinued her studies.

296
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,006
Oh no! Why?

297
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,806
Was forced to discontinue because of illness.

298
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:49,904
Please come, sir!

299
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,628
House looks very unsafe!

300
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,620
Will my things be safe here?

301
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,992
Oh sir! Many things that are
Outside, are not here!

302
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,500
Like robbery, Dog, alcohol,
Snake and Suicide!

303
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:14,336
That's great!

304
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,096
And l've already told you about Cinema!

305
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,064
l'm leaving the bike here...

306
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,106
lt belongs to Sport Council!

307
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,974
Don't l need a helmet?

308
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,043
5 feet wide roads and
maximum speed of 15 kmph!

309
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,578
-No one wears a helmet here, Sir!
-Then ok!

310
00:26:47,806 --> 00:27:02,779
Team DrC

311
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:28,603
SUBJAlL -KAVARATTl

312
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,483
Good morning, doctor!

313
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,183
-Going for sightseeing?!
-Just like that!

314
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,517
Why the jail is left in this condition?

315
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,460
People winded it up.

316
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:48,223
Do the people here create so much trouble?!

317
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,666
Only if anyone creates problem
they can be put inside, right?

318
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,036
No crimes at all.

319
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,438
Right!

320
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,044
Which is the way to Naval base?

321
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,509
Going for a drink, aren't you?

322
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:07,351
When it's military, one can drink
a good stuff with trust!

323
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,214
l see! ln that case,
you'll vacate from here soon!

324
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,080
Why?

325
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,349
The whole of Lakshadweep is a dry land.

326
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,219
You won't even get a drop!

327
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,419
Oh my Gosh! What an adversity!

328
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,588
Whenever l'm back from the hometown,

329
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,228
l carry 2-3 bottles along with me.

330
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,033
Nobody searches my bag.

331
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,036
You're really great, doctor!

332
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,105
For today's quota, l'll give.
But don't make it a habit.

333
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,073
Okay.

334
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,473
So...the day l start to drink
l will surely visit your quarters.

335
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:46,215
l'm fit since my birth!
So l neverfelt like drinking till now.

336
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,055
Doctor, way to the Naval base?

337
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,424
Ask someone and go!

338
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:11,648
What do you want?

339
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,483
-ls Zakhariah there?
-Gone to his hometown!

340
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,778
Will return only after a month.

341
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,512
When did he leave?

342
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,793
Yesterday! lt was some
emergency call from home!

343
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:46,110
Team DrC

344
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,087
My dearfolks and friends, greetings!

345
00:29:51,689 --> 00:30:05,660
Mansoor Jilani and Wahida ties
wedlock on 2015 August 14

346
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:15,270
Thus, l warmly welcome
inhabitants here and outside.

347
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,095
Hello!! Have you finished seeing the island?

348
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,700
Almost! lt's just a few days since l arrived!

349
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,367
When you feel bored, come to the station
and learn recording.

350
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,369
You need to announce, right?

351
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,350
Okay! Anyhow, give me a call.

352
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,546
lt's from hospital.
No further evacuation orders.

353
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,554
My brother had come..
There's no ship for next 4 days.

354
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,456
lf any evacuation order is passed,
l could board him in a Helicopterto Kochi.

355
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,728
ls there any chopper service
when there's no ship?

356
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,229
There is no such service from here.

357
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,368
As there is limited facility
in the hospital here,

358
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,901
ln case if any emergency arises, they
would be referred to the hospital in Kochi.

359
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,503
Unless and until Medical Superintendent
certifies the graveness of illness,

360
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,142
they will not be sent to
Kochi by a helicopter.

361
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,504
ln such a situation, others can pay
and occupy the vacant seats.

362
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,712
Medical Superintendent will not
certify that easily.

363
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,781
After reaching Kochi, if it's found
that illness is not grave,

364
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:28,884
Superintendent will lose his job

365
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,619
And the patient will be slammed with
a penalty of lakhs of rupees!

366
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:01,379
Nitrogen Narcosis or Rapture of the
deep or the Martini effect!

367
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,882
-You might've heard any one of
these 3 names. -No Sir!

368
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,191
-Didn't you? - No.

369
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,227
Okay, then!
Have any one of you drunk alcohol?

370
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:22,638
Couple of drinks without
anyone's notice at least

371
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,703
Sir, are you searching
someone for a company?

372
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,373
You kids are not enough for my company.

373
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,882
Tell me, has anyone of you?

374
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,646
He had drunk before.

375
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,351
Oh, sir! Only once!

376
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,522
lf it's known,
l'll be thrown out of the house!

377
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,656
No one will know!

378
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,994
Okay, then you tell me, what
do you feel after getting drunk?

379
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,501
Like going on a boat,
when there's a storm!

380
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,997
We will feel weightless
and lose our balance at times!

381
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,400
And become more courageous!

382
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,335
Heard this, guys?

383
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,875
This feel that you get after drinking alcohol,

384
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,378
can be felt by a diver even
without drinking alcohol!

385
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:04,544
When?

386
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,043
while diving in the open sea
at more than 30m depth!

387
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,819
This state is called Nitrogen Narcosis!

388
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,557
-Has anyone of you crossed 30m?
- No, sir.

389
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:20,691
Okay, then we will be crossing 30m today.

390
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,667
-Ready? - Ready, sir.

391
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,534
Replace these four cylinders.

392
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,967
Carbon-monoxide is mixed in it!

393
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,304
Will it be a risk?

394
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,872
lt's poisonous gas!

395
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,704
lf inhaled, one may be alive
for a maximum of 4 hours only!

396
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,676
-Who did this?
- Nobody has done it.

397
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,949
Lubricating oil in the
compressor has leaked out.

398
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,552
When Hydrocarbon gets mixed,
Carbon monoxide is formed!

399
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,519
Good morning, sir!

400
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,892
l'm sorry, l flouted your mission that day.

401
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,062
No, that's okay!

402
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,994
l am Deeraj Nayyar,
Sub-lieutenant!

403
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,731
l'm on shore patrol duty today.

404
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,398
-How do you speak Malayalam?
-l had my training in Kochi.

405
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,405
You hold a record in Deep sea diving, right?

406
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,746
l didn't dive for a record!

407
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,411
Oh, was that a rescue mission then?

408
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,775
l did it for my photo and name to be
published in the newspapers!

409
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:23,984
One of my close friends is
missing for a long time. No contact!

410
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:29,096
After seeing my photo in the paper,
l hoped they would contact me.

411
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,096
Right? l'll see you around, then.

412
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:51,118
Okay, guys! Hold for
3 mins at 10m depth!

413
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,580
l shall join you then!

414
00:34:53,191 --> 00:35:12,738
Team DrC

415
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,980
-Hi Muthumani-Hi Chandu uncle,
Have you met Zakariah?

416
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,150
No, dear! He's gone to his hometown.

417
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,812
l'm intensely searching the friends request
and also searching the name.

418
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,580
But there is no Nadira!

419
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,982
What does your lover say?

420
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,485
He's very much happy!

421
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,389
l got a call. Let me go then.

422
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,998
-To where?
- To the bottom of the sea, bye!

423
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:15,058
Team DrC

424
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,135
Hello...No...then?

425
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:32,248
Hey, Zakhariah!

426
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:37,784
Hey, it's me, dude!

427
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,261
Hey, rascal!

428
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,679
lt's me, Shantanu! Stop the bike.

429
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,846
Dude, lt's me, Shantanu!

430
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,009
Hey, stop!

431
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,212
The one behind is our instructor!

432
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,883
And the one in front is
Zakhariah sir of the light house!

433
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,081
Something wrong!

434
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,254
Ever since he came,
he has been asking for the lighthouse.

435
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,585
Hold this.

436
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:24,954
What do you want?

437
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,220
-Where's Zakhariah?
-He's not here.

438
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,431
-Where did he go?
-l don't know.

439
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,433
-When will he return?
-l don't know.

440
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,229
-What's your name?
-l don't know.

441
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,432
My name is Kunjikoya!

442
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,741
Move aside!

443
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,449
You can't climb up there today.

444
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,114
-Why?-Today is Friday!

445
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,232
l called you several times!

446
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,778
When you knew it was me,
you cut the phone.

447
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,210
Since then, you never attended
my call even once.

448
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:56,012
-ls that why you came here?
- Yes

449
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,184
lf l'd known that you would come here,
then surely l would've attended your call!

450
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,015
So you were hiding from
my sight for these many days!

451
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,895
No! l thought you would go back
after loitering here for two days.

452
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,198
Going back will not be immediate!

453
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,398
l've joined here on sports deputation
as Diving lnstructor!

454
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,137
Oh Jesus!

455
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:29,043
l need to gather some more
information from here. You must help me.

456
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,149
What's it?

457
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:39,919
One Nazeeb lmam - Sub Lieutenant
in the Naval base,

458
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:49,766
From his name and age,
l doubt he's Nadira's brother!!

459
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:50,303
lf so?

460
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:57,770
lt's the last chance of finding
more information about her.

461
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,455
lf l go there directly,
he may identify me.

462
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,058
And that will be the end of everything!

463
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,055
l can't take any chance in this!

464
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,995
-So, please...-Shut up, you bloody!

465
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,592
Jump from here and die! Rascal!!

466
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,599
You're almost 40 years
Shameless fellow!

467
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,040
Still hanging around aimlessly
for his bloody old love!!

468
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,245
For supporting you in this matter in the past,
my life turned upside down!

469
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,810
That's called FATE, dude!

470
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,208
lt's not FATE but SNOBBlSHNESS
- Merely Snobbishness!

471
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,048
Bloody friend.....and hell with his love!!

472
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,585
Now, l'm not 25 years old.

473
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,582
But l'm still 25!

474
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:44,926
l will give you a whack..

475
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,268
When Captain Zakhariah was
coming home on holidays,

476
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,836
Eagerly waiting for a bottle from his son
's quota....was the Retired officer Varunni ...

477
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,836
...My dad!!

478
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,474
But l went home with my luggage
having lost my job - all because of you!

479
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,473
Since l lost the job, the girl,
who was supposed to marry me,

480
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,074
and her parents whizzed away
after saluting me.

481
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,080
Who's the loser, then? Me only!

482
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,984
Later, l got a job in this lighthouse,

483
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,420
and when my hairturned grey
and l almost got fixed to another girl,

484
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,890
But the day before the betrothal,
she eloped with someone else.

485
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,493
-As usual what happened to me?
- You lost again!

486
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,897
ls marriage the biggest thing in life?

487
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:24,964
For me, it's YES!

488
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,164
l shall perform your third marriage, then!

489
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,474
And l'll get as many bottles
as your dad needs!

490
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,202
But you got to help me with this, please.

491
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,106
No, Zakhariah, sir! Leave him!

492
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,047
Rascal!! lt's 10 yrs
since my dad expired.

493
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,014
Leave me...Leave me l say.

494
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,185
Leave him, Koya!
Let him hit me!

495
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,618
Come on, you hit me

496
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:57,857
Team DrC

497
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,194
l have been hearing such jibes
since so many years!

498
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:07,208
lf anyone in the family loved
or eloped with someone,

499
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,241
they will heap the blame upon me finally
saying they are learning from me.

500
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,146
lt was only a PRANK at the age of 25!

501
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:23,626
But l didn't expect this will
haunt me throughout my life.

502
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,635
l've gone crazy after losing my composure!

503
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,331
Let's get some news about it
and then put the shutter..

504
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,235
..for everything!

505
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:51,244
-ls he suffering from some illness?
- Yes!

506
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,249
The same illness which your
sister was afflicted with!

507
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,223
LOVE!

508
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:10,338
''ls it medicine or poison, my friend...''

509
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:18,347
''ls it happiness or deluge, my friend...''

510
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:32,618
''No one has brought yet the
news of my love, friend...''

511
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:39,633
''Love is a story of destitute souls...''

512
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:45,173
''lt's a fire that burns the youth...''

513
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:51,137
''Whatever the world may say...
l'm sure that...''

514
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:56,809
''Love is mirage...
it's not real...''

515
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:02,784

Don't go there.

692
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:09,807
You bloody bastard!
Take off your hand from my daughter.

693
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,208
Get away from here.

694
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,118
This bastard molested my daughter.

695
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,121
Beat that rascal!

696
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:25,486
What are you resorting to?

697
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:27,253
What the hell did he do?

698
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:28,820
Leave him.

699
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:31,698
Stop it.

700
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,131
Stop it!

701
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:33,768
She said to stop it!

702
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:42,372
lf you wish to beat him, then,

703
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:51,918
Sir!

704
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,263
Take your detention order.

705
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,242
Give it to me

706
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,405
ls kissing such a big offence?

707
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,284
He's trying to threaten us!

708
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:25,784
Not a threat!! He has initiated
for Court martial proceedings...Look..

709
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,621
My name also appears in this list!
What did l do?

710
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,451
Did l interlock your lips?

711
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:33,920
At least you enjoyed the pleasure.

712
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,820
What did l gain? l got into a fix now.

713
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,287
You may read the charge.

714
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,891
Charge against the 1st accused.

715
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:06,386
You, Shantanu P - Sub lieutenant

716
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:10,928
have forcibly kissed and
molested Ms.Nadira lmam

717
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:16,237
..D/o Jaffar lmam, only 15 yrs
old on the 15th of April at 2 p.m.

718
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,639
ls shejust 15 yrs?

719
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,791
How do you plead,
guilty or not guilty?

720
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:42,660
Sir....that girl....

721
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,495
l didn't know that girl was
just 15 yrs old.

722
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:47,691
Let him speak in English or Hindi.

723
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,063
Not in regional language.

724
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,704
l didn't know she was
just 15 yrs old, sir.

725
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,434
That means he is pleading guilty.

726
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,645
Mr.Prosecutor, please sit down.

727
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:05,278
Mr.Shantanu, your answer
should either be a YES or a NO

728
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:14,728
No, sir!

729
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,062
Okay, let's proceed with the next charge.

730
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,063
Charge against the 2nd accused.

731
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:27,064
Zakhariah K V - Lieutenant signal officer

732
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,937
has abetted and hereby
supported the 1st accused

733
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:33,547
in committing molestation of
Ms.Nadira lmam D/o Jaffar lmam,

734
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,718
15 yrs on the 15th of April at 2.p.m.

735
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,725
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

736
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:44,755
Not guilty, sir.

737
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,692
This case is posted for trial
on the17th of August.

738
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,086
Sorry l'm helpless!
No defence can be taken here.

739
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,651
She is just 15 yrs old.

740
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,984
lf she is below 16 yrs and
even if it's with herfull consent.

741
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,086
That's an offence.

742
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:20,825
She doesn't appear like a 15 yr old girl.

743
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,724
Who knows she will be fed
with junk foods to misdirect us.

744
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,400
Well, What have l done to
frame abetting charges against me?

745
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,964
Did l ask you to kiss her?.

746
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:31,733
The allegation against you is
guarding outside the shower room,

747
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,567
preventing others from entering

748
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,741
That girl's dad , the RearAdmiral Jaffar lmam
is the eyewitness.

749
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:38,571
lsn't that enough?

750
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,581
Maximum, what will happen?

751
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,810
lf proven guilty, under moral turpitude,
dismissal is sure.

752
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:50,091
lf the girl's answer is YES to the
question whether she was kissed,

753
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:54,519
Oh my heavens!

754
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,600
Ms.Nadira, Yes or No!

755
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:13,807
Yes or No?

756
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:20,848
Oh Jesus!

757
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:26,827
Yes!

758
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,864
That may be recorded, sir.
l've no more questions.

759
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,734
The guilty against the accused
is proved beyond doubt!

760
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,074
No!

761
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:46,515
What do you mean?

762
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,910
He's not guilty, sir.

763
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,453
We're in love.

764
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,098
l love him.

765
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,167
l really love him.

766
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,951
See, Nadira, it's absolutely irrelevant
whether you love him or not!

767
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:26,919
The issue in question is..

768
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:29,647
Mr.Prosecutor, stop counselling her.

769
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,029
The Court will be in recession for one hour.

770
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:45,562
Team DrC

771
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,140
lf the judgement is pronounced,
you will be terminated from the service.

772
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,516
Sir, but what is my offence?

773
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:02,752
Many heartless people have queued up
to give witness against you!

774
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,122
There is only one option left.

775
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,026
Take voluntary discharge and leave!

776
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:14,166
lf so, you can seek a job
in the coast guard or Sports department.

777
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:18,966
lf it is a termination,

778
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:23,100
Then, criminal proceedings,
Jail...You know all that

779
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,847
Only God can help you

780
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:43,795
l'm ready, sir.

781
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:39,449
Team DrC

782
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,947
We don't need any valid reason
to fall in love!

783
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,120
But to feel a deep love,
there should be some valid reason.

784
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,059
What really happened for you
to pine for her?

785
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,133
There is really nothing
in what l'd said so far!

786
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:56,068
But that happened ...only later.

787
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:21,760
Yes, come in.

788
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,909
lt's your childish prank that
has spoiled this man's career and life.

789
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,272
No, uncle...You're wrong.

790
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:44,980
l'm serious about this.

791
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:50,884
l'm serious about him.

792
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,130
Serious? You are only 15!

793
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,800
You're not matured enough
to take a serious decision about this.

794
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,203
That's what the law says.

795
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,202
Her age is such that,
she cannot even realize herself!

796
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:07,805
Serious it seems!!

797
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,174
lf we ask her about this after 5 yrs,

798
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:13,381
She herself will start laughing.

799
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,044
Do you think so?

800
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:28,388
Five years!

801
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,993
Okay! After 5 yrs, l'll show you

802
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,462
l'll convince you....

803
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,466
...all of you..

804
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,980
An obstinate challenge of a 15 yr old girl

805
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,190
l only thought that much.

806
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:01,453
But unexpected hopes were
lying somewhere else.

807
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:16,467
Then?

808
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:23,150
Did she respond to you after five years?

809
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,448
Yes!

810
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:27,487
How?

811
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:34,392
She erupted like... a bomb blast!

812
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,228
Muthaapi is serious.

813
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:42,026
He is being evacuated
through the helicopter!

814
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,239
Poorfellow! He has been
bedridden for long.

815
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:45,462
Pray to God!

816
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:47,575
You continue

817
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:49,209
What is it?

818
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:50,878
Bro! Duva is also going along with him.

819
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,944
Duva! What a deceit!

820
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,614
Move...Let's rush..
We must not let her go.

821
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,050
She will go definitely this time

822
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:57,214
What's the problem, Koya?

823
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,319
All such problems are
triggered by people like you!!

824
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:03,224
-What's it? -You take the bike!

825
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:12,460
Duva, Koya's sister is
exactly yourfemale version!

826
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,163
She fell in love with a guy
in Medical College.

827
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,371
Knowing about that, Koya
didn't send her back afterthe vacation.

828
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:19,641
2 years have passed.

829
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,236
She boarded the ship couple
of times after evading from Koya's sight.

830
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,213
Some rascals like him, will inform Koya,

831
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,415
and he will bring her back.

832
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,480
Why? lsn't that guy a Muslim?

833
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,210
That's not the issue here.

834
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,181
lf she goes, Attakoya will be left alone.

835
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,489
lf it's a guy from this island....

836
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,082
That is Koya's tension.

837
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,585
How can she forsake her love?

838
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:41,588
Oh! Sailing in the same boat?!

839
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:46,160
Shall l go fast and stop Koya from going?

840
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,428
l'll kick you to pulp, damn it!

841
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,433
Do you want to intervene and
get me beaten up by people?

842
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,637
lf she is destined then she will go

843
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:54,005
-Poor thing !-Who?

844
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,106
You only.

845
01:16:59,281 --> 01:16:59,940
Please move.

846
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:04,350
See you then.

847
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:13,483
May the Lord protect him!

848
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:42,920
Why the hell is it not flying!

849
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,090
You did a good thing, doctor!

850
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:51,221
Uniting lovers....whether in a story or real life.
Everybody likes it!

851
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:55,536
Ask him to fly soon before that fellow arrives.

852
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:07,407
Hello, why the delay? Can't you fly?

853
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,174
A Navy staff is also going to Kochi!!
He'll be coming now.

854
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,587
See, this is an air ambulance.
l'm the Medical Superintendent.

855
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:13,955
And l certified the evacuation.

856
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,019
Patient can't wait for any Navy people

857
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,488
Don't worry, ma'am.
lt's only a matter of 5 mins.

858
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:21,052
-We'll make it up in plan..
- How dare you say..

859
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,598
Who the hell is coming now?

860
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:29,232
Doctor, l can feel the spark of a love
affair behind you in this!

861
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,768
Yes of course! Who doesn't have?

862
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,108
Don't worry, l will come.

863
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:36,403
Move aside....

864
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:43,413
Bro...there, she's!.

865
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:49,347
-Dear Duva!-Oh Jesus

866
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,063
Please come back, dear!

867
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:03,265
Come back l say! lt'll not work out!

868
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,238
Please come back.

869
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:10,110
l will not be alive if you go.

870
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,241
Why do you talk like this, brother?

871
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,448
Come back.

872
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,347
Come back, dear.

873
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,267
Come, let's go

874
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,501
Saeed, you go and assist!

875
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:45,810
Doctor, do l have to take any medicines?

876
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:49,681
Yes! This medicine is for you.

877
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:51,041
Give way.

878
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,448
Doctor is really smart.

879
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,385
-She is not like what you see!
-Much more than this??

880
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:05,694
-Who's that? - Navy man! Deeraj!

881
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:11,370
l'm getting close to him
to find the whereabouts about Nazeeb!

882
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:14,307
That guy was gathering details
about you from Attakoya!

883
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:15,510
-Really?
- Hmm

884
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:34,519
Team DrC

885
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,271
What's the name of that
Navy man in the passenger list?

886
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:30,615
NAZEEB lMAM

887
01:21:56,044 --> 01:22:20,028
Team DrC

888
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:29,671
That was my last and final chance
to find some information about her!

889
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:31,506
That hope is also shattered!

890
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:35,279
The very person from whose sight
l wanted to hide...

891
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:38,383
There l jumped straight onto him
on the very 1st day!

892
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,487
He came to know the facts and...

893
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:41,915
fled from here!

894
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,917
How can you be so sure
that he's Nadira's brother?.

895
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:45,259
Don't moan needlessly!

896
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,361
Then, why did he lie to me
that his name was Deeraj?

897
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,828
...and why did he collect
my details from Attakoya?

898
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:51,822
That must be of..

899
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,629
That boy went on 10 days leave

900
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:55,927
He didn't quit the job and go!

901
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,932
But one thing is confirmed.
His dad's name is Jaffar lmam.

902
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,812
So, you can relax for 10 days until his return!

903
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:11,809
Forthe time being...
didn't you say that she put a bomb after 5 yrs?

904
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,014
Tell us about that incident.

905
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:20,825
He again started!

906
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:25,792
Five years must've passed!

907
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:29,932
lt was when l was working
in Alapuzha sports division,

908
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:31,932
did that bomb explode!

909
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:35,667
Who is that? Joseph?

910
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,080
Who are you?

911
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:53,657
Leave me.

912
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:57,431
Lock him up!

913
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,739
Ahmed Kutty! DYSP of Police!

914
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:10,736
Sir, You are a Policeman?

915
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,580
Sorry! You didn't appear so! Leave me..

916
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:17,812
No need of a gun! l'm not a troublesome guy.

917
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:20,116
Where is Nadira?

918
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:22,816
Who?

919
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,113
Nadira lmam!

920
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:34,593
Answer me.

921
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:56,956
Dad, l'm no more 15 year old girl.

922
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:00,594
You can't punish Shanthanu for this,

923
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,758
that l love him,

924
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:05,394
or that he loves me!

925
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:08,124
l'm going away with Shantanu.

926
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,598
Don't even try to bring me back.

927
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:25,381
Officer!

928
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,753
Nadira, where are you?

929
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:36,561
ls Shantanu there or not?

930
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:38,397
First tell me, where you are?

931
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,126
Give the phone to Shantanu.

932
01:25:41,870 --> 01:26:00,051
Team DrC

933
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:05,957
Did they hurt you?

934
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:07,654
No!

935
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:10,687
lt was very difficult to find you,

936
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,523
but, not for my dad!

937
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,764
So, l had to choose this route!

938
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,137
lt's okay

939
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,707
l'm sure he would've made you
listen to a CD.

940
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:21,675
Yes!

941
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,568
Even after 5 years,

942
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:25,702
without changing a word,

943
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:29,972
whatever l wish to say, is recorded on that CD.

944
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:34,546
But the condition of your heart is also like
mine,

945
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:37,953
l'll wait for you.

946
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,553
Should l or not?

947
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:44,123
You should!

948
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:45,557
Stop it, Nadira!

949
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,965
Dad, l haven't gone missing

950
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:53,462
l went to visit Ajmer Sheriff
and am back home now.

951
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:03,549
l'm so sorry.

952
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,551
He showed us only the
search warrant of Lucknow SP!

953
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:13,781
Team DrC

954
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:23,263
''The sky reclines, the shore swings,''

955
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:32,639
''The time hums, the star listens.''

956
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:42,006
''Like waves, she spun in me,
a net of dream''

957
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:46,117
''At this time when eyes close''

958
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:50,787
''And the darkness flows''

959
01:28:51,626 --> 01:29:00,000
''Will the mirage of dark cloud
disappear or change?''

960
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:10,000
''The sky reclines, the shore swings,''

961
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:19,017
''The time hums, the star listens.''

962
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:49,408
You?

963
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:56,216
Are you here to take Nadira away?

964
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:00,457
ln the last 6 years,
not even once l have come to your house, Sir!

965
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:06,765
She troubled even you forthis
and after taking so much pain, she found me!

966
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:11,438
So, isn't it my responsibility to come here?!

967
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:15,738
After all, are we all not men of honour, sir?

968
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:18,445
Oh! So that's your answer!

969
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:25,111
You can't go with him without my permission

970
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:28,153
You can go,

971
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,317
...but after my death!.

972
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:47,998
Your word ''l WlLL WAlT''
is what made me come here!

973
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:14,998
l told you, right? ...
if you want to go, then go after my death!

974
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:19,165
lf you really want to go urgently now,

975
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:23,207
then, l'm ready to die before my time.

976
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:31,918
No, dad! l'll not go without your permission!

977
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:34,921
Even after your death!

978
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:38,423
lt's my promise to you!

979
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:53,768
l will wait for your permission.

980
01:31:56,077 --> 01:32:00,411
But, till then, you shouldn't
question my wait!

981
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:04,415
The number of days Nadira will wait for you,

982
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:08,048
hatred for you will increase equivalently

983
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,555
Some day your idea will change, sir.

984
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,030
The day you understand who l am!

985
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:30,234
Team DrC

986
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,209
l'm sorry.

987
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:40,277
l can't do anything more than this for now.

988
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:42,484
lt's a question of Royal blood!

989
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,213
Will take time, right?

990
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:46,820
l can understand.

991
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,428
One fine day father will accept.

992
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:52,293
But l don't know when that day will come!...

993
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:58,437
l don't have any right
to force you to wait till then.

994
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:06,909
But yes...l'll surely wait.

995
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:18,650
Me too!

996
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:07,234
This is not called WAlTlNG
but WAlT FOREVER!

997
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:13,039
You are aiming for an impossible thing!

998
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:16,345
Her dad is mad.

999
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:18,207
and his daughter is even more mad than him!

1000
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:20,910
Trying to put your life amidst that as fixed
deposit

1001
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:21,516
You are totally mad!

1002
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:24,456
You're a moron! What else can l call you!

1003
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,018
Suppose during sleep, that Hamam....

1004
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:28,956
lmam, right?

1005
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:33,029
Yes, lmam! Suppose he
dies of heart attack during sleep

1006
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:34,029
Then your condition will be like...

1007
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:35,528
What's that flower called...

1008
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:36,934
Anthurium?

1009
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:38,705
Exactly! Anthurium! That will be your condition.

1010
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:43,334
or assume that old man
agrees on the verge of his death,

1011
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:48,672
What's the point? Even
she will turn grey like you.

1012
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:53,251
Do people love only for that reason?

1013
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:55,045
No, to kneel down and worship.

1014
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:58,315
According to my knowledge,
there is only one meaning for UNlTlNG

1015
01:34:58,492 --> 01:35:00,392
l'm not sure whether it has
other meaning in Hindi.

1016
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:03,063
-Assume there's! - Yes.

1017
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:05,761
Didn't she put any other bomb?

1018
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:09,401
To put bombs, is she a native of Kannur?

1019
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:14,074
l didn't mean that.
Didn't she try to contact you afterthat?

1020
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:16,768
She was contacting me
over the phone for three years.

1021
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:22,447
l'd also been to Lucknow
couple of times to meet her.

1022
01:35:23,284 --> 01:35:26,515
She was studying in the
Sufi center overthere.

1023
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:43,334
Team DrC

1024
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,255
Quite often, she sends CDs to me.

1025
01:36:03,624 --> 01:36:06,354
Few Sufi songs in her own voice,

1026
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:15,260
and some love quotes in Sufism
which makes me crazy!

1027
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:26,241
''When a heart burns a heart,
when heart is in love, God is merciful...''

1028
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:36,379
''One who sacrifices life for love...
one who stakes life wins love...''

1029
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:43,057
But in the CD that came at last,

1030
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:46,327
lt was not her voice.

1031
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:54,541
l'm Jaffer lmam here.

1032
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:59,674
lf you hadn't interfered in
Nadira's life from distance,

1033
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:05,511
yourfake love would fly away
like dust in a gust of wind.

1034
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:08,814
That's why you seek reasons
to keep herthinking about you.

1035
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:14,884
That Nadira keeps remembering you.

1036
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:19,889
Hereafter you'll never
listen Nadira's voice.

1037
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:23,836
You'll die...waiting for her.

1038
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:25,667
What does it mean?

1039
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:31,900
lt's 2 years on.....there is no contact.

1040
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:35,245
Her mobile phone is switched off.

1041
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:38,612
l enquired all possible ways.

1042
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:42,252
And only came to know
they have shifted from Lucknow.

1043
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,883
At such a dead end situation,

1044
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:50,727
l did an adventurous thing!

1046
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:08,708
l broke the record in the Deep sea free diving!

1047
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:12,582
Risking my life and limb!

1048
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:17,823
lf this becomes a news,
l thought she might contact me.

1049
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:25,463
lt became news but nothing happened.

1050
01:38:25,966 --> 01:38:27,934
As he said that you'll not hear
her voice any longer,

1051
01:38:28,602 --> 01:38:30,502
Would that ruthless fellow
have harmed her?

1052
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:36,932
That Nazeeb was my last and
final chance of finding her.

1053
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,413
Would she have got married?

1054
01:38:42,249 --> 01:38:43,477
Forthat, she has to die!

1055
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:48,915
-Or if she had died...-Shut up, you!

1056
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:55,928
That's why l say l'll shutter
after knowing the facts!

1057
01:38:57,464 --> 01:38:58,362
What all these

1058
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:06,667
-Nothing... l just thought... - Leave it..

1059
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:11,476
lt's just a matter of 10 days

1060
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:12,508
Let that boy return!

1061
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:14,504
l'll somehow make him disclose the truth.

1062
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,280
Greetings!! We've a sad news.

1063
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:28,922
Muthukoya, 73 yrs old,
died at Medical Trust, Kochi!

1064
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:36,426
His funeral will be held tomorrow
10 am at Mattanchery Juma Masjid

1065
01:39:42,576 --> 01:39:45,807
Won't his body be brought back here?

1066
01:39:47,548 --> 01:39:49,448
That's the fate of the
inhabitants of this island

1067
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:52,717
lf someone dies outside the island,
burial also will be done there itself.

1068
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:55,422
There is no way to bring back the body,

1069
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:59,926
and the relatives can never see the body.

1070
01:40:03,597 --> 01:40:04,256
See you, then.

1071
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:09,866
Are you coming with me or going to quarters

1072
01:40:10,971 --> 01:40:11,494

01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:13,997
King of Music - Shahjahan's music fest will
be conducted at Panchayat stage tonight at 7
p.m.

1099
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:20,374
Rajeev, are you expecting anyone?

1100
01:45:20,714 --> 01:45:21,237
His sister's son!

1101
01:45:22,282 --> 01:45:24,182
- l need to collect a parcel. - Get it!

1102
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,778
Would the music fest begins on time?

1103
01:45:28,188 --> 01:45:28,779
Why? Do l've to delay it?

1104
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:32,189
She's the devil who tried to send away Duva!

1105
01:45:33,026 --> 01:45:35,153
When Shahjahan sir arrives, l will go with him.

1106
01:45:35,362 --> 01:45:37,387
-l shall settle him up and come back - Okay.

1107
01:45:38,031 --> 01:45:41,159
Take him away from the junction and hit him

1108
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:42,259
lf people come to know...

1109
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,333
Whatever may be, it's the case of LOVE!!

1110
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:46,369
Hitting whom?

1111
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:50,767
You only said you will hit Nazeeb
to disclose the truth.

1112
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:53,007
Better go and look out for Shahjahan!

1113
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:54,779
This is the problem with the
people living outside!

1114
01:45:55,148 --> 01:45:57,013
Only knows to brag but do nothing!

1115
01:45:58,051 --> 01:45:59,018
Don't prompt me to say..

1116
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:00,718
lt's Shahjahan, sir!

1117
01:46:01,154 --> 01:46:03,884
Sir, We're waiting in the Jetty.

1118
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:04,986
What happened?

1119
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,719
Why needlessly shoot up your BP?

1120
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:10,988
Can't l shoot up my BP?

1121
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:13,996
-Let me go to Jetty - Yes, you move.

1122
01:46:14,234 --> 01:46:14,996
What for?

1123
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:16,795
We just want to know whether
he's back or not!

1124
01:46:17,304 --> 01:46:18,999
Do you have any objection
if he knows it first?

1125
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:19,728
You go.

1126
01:46:21,074 --> 01:46:29,880

He is not in this boat! l checked.

Hello...No...Next boat has come.
Let me check.

1129
01:46:53,373 --> 01:46:54,340
Here comes Shahjahan sir!!

1130

-S.l Jamal-Greetings!

1135
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:27,734
Stand aside.

1136
01:47:29,242 --> 01:47:31,710
People are so excited

1137
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:33,812
lt's the same wherever l go!

1138
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,331
Greetings!

1139
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:58,330
l understood! From his scorn l made out,
that he's an outsider!

1140
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:03,770
He's not in this boat also.

1141
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:08,207
Shucks! Only one more boat is left.

1142
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:16,752
Won't he come..

1143
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:25,021
lf there's something that he's scared
to tell me, then he won't come!

1144
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:43,575
So that is also confirmed!

1145
01:48:47,053 --> 01:48:48,179
What happened? Did he come?

1146
01:48:51,258 --> 01:48:52,020
What happened?

1147
01:48:53,059 --> 01:48:56,028
Nothing happened, Koya. He didn't come.

1148
01:48:57,063 --> 01:48:59,429
He didn't go to come back!

1149
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:03,435
Shucks! l needlessly disturbed all of you..

1150
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:08,231
Forget it, dude! See you, then.

1151
01:50:46,406 --> 01:50:47,498
Have you cooled down?

1152
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,647
Were you weeping in the Sea?

1153
01:50:55,248 --> 01:50:56,237
Shut up!

1154
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:57,640
l'll give you a whack..

1155
01:51:00,086 --> 01:51:02,486
You unnecessary waste your time for a mere
word

1156
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:03,681
lt's zero now.

1157
01:51:05,225 --> 01:51:06,556
Not only in love...in anything

1158
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,518
No man should be 100 %% honest!

1159
01:51:09,062 --> 01:51:11,030
That's why the world exists like this!

1160
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:11,526
Got it!!

1161
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:15,033
My life wouldn't have been
given that importance.

1162
01:51:16,403 --> 01:51:18,030
Forget it! lt's over!

1163
01:51:22,542 --> 01:51:23,566
What's the use of waiting?

1164
01:51:24,277 --> 01:51:25,175
What's the use of going?

1165
01:51:28,548 --> 01:51:31,039
Anyhow l'm not Ramanan to commit suicide!

1166
01:51:32,085 --> 01:51:34,952
l want to live somehow for the sake of life

1167
01:51:36,222 --> 01:51:37,211
Don't waste time

1168
01:51:38,258 --> 01:51:40,453
There's a good idea for passing our time!

1169
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:41,524
-Did you get it? - Yes

1170
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:45,263
Alcohol is the best medicine
for the disturbed mind

1171
01:51:46,099 --> 01:51:47,066
Today is the right day to begin.

1172
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:50,403
Why don't you take a couple of drinks?
You must. Come.

1173
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:52,696
You're already drenched!

1174

-You sing well, don't you?
-No...no..it will not look nice!

Actually, l didn't write the
lyrics of this song,

1187
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:32,466
but it came flowing into me!
Same is the case with its tune!

1188

l've a new singer on the stage to sing
along with me.

1189

But quite a familiar face for you people.

1190

l warmly welcome Duva Mian Koya
to this musical stage.

1191
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:06,704
You have to sing along with the Orchestra.

01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:09,868
Doctor's prank l suppose!!

1193
01:54:10,210 --> 01:54:11,575
Does she sing?

1194

01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:22,874
''With lips humming the tune of a koel''

1211
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:25,943
''You scratched this way and that way''

1212
01:56:26,045 --> 01:56:28,309
''Do you remember?''

1213
01:56:28,548 --> 01:56:31,073
''Try to remember''

1214
01:56:31,718 --> 01:56:34,209
''Do you see?''

1215
01:56:34,454 --> 01:56:37,190
''l stood seeing''

1216
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:42,218
''When the youthful age passes,
will this be over?''

1217
01:56:42,795 --> 01:56:48,256
''That girl, with the smell of milk''

1218
01:56:48,534 --> 01:56:54,234
''That girl, with the smell of milk''

1219
01:56:58,544 --> 01:57:05,848
Team DrC

1220
01:57:16,162 --> 01:57:23,169
''Naughty rains came on the day
you gave me that letter and left''

1221
01:57:23,169 --> 01:57:28,106
''ln the high seas all night long
l cried my heart out and sang''

1222
01:57:28,674 --> 01:57:31,302
''Shattered, l sang''

1223
01:57:31,844 --> 01:57:33,869
''Are you listening''

1224
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,648
''You are listening''

1225
01:57:37,483 --> 01:57:43,156
''Are you waiting, l am waiting''

1226
01:57:43,156 --> 01:57:47,286
''Won't you hug me tightly
ln the rushing cold wind''

1227
01:57:48,428 --> 01:57:54,300
''That girl with the smell of milk''

1228
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:59,897
''That girl with the smell of milk''

1229
01:58:02,308 --> 01:58:03,104
Thank you!

1230
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:07,539
-You really rocked! - Really?

1231
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:08,977
-Your song was splendid!
- Thank you.

1232
01:58:09,215 --> 01:58:10,583
-Really?-Rocking

1233
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:12,312
What's your problem?

1234
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:17,723
l've many problems! What did you intend?

1235
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:19,485
Don't prompt me to intend more.

1236
01:58:22,228 --> 01:58:23,525
Please go, brother.

1237
01:58:23,696 --> 01:58:26,028
-Don't insult her!
-You be quiet, Jamal

1238
01:58:26,632 --> 01:58:28,361
l'll decide what l have to do!

1239
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:31,028
You just mind your business, doctor!
Don't act smart!

1240
01:58:31,571 --> 01:58:34,140
l know you are not behind
all those cheers and fuss!

1241
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:35,107
l'm not a fool.

1242
01:58:35,575 --> 01:58:37,440
Leave it Koya, Don't mess up things

1243
01:58:37,777 --> 01:58:41,235
Certainly! lt was the support of
people who are aware of her likings!!

1244
01:58:41,314 --> 01:58:43,111
ls it you who's deciding about her
likes and dislikes?

1245
01:58:43,182 --> 01:58:44,444
Let's move, sister! Come..

1246
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:46,950
Leave it, Koya! Why creating a
ruckus for a silly thing?

1247
01:58:47,086 --> 01:58:49,577
First, learn about LOVE and AFFECTlON!

1248
01:58:50,423 --> 01:58:53,119
lf he doesn't know,
somebody teach him please.

1249
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:56,124
Just a minute...Only for a minute, please.

1250
01:58:56,696 --> 01:58:57,720
Then go and mess up!

1251
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:01,556
Actually, who are you?

1252
01:59:01,868 --> 01:59:05,167
Doctor or a Teacher, to preach about LOVE?

1253
01:59:05,404 --> 01:59:08,840
Going on and on about affection
and love for a long time!

1254
01:59:09,142 --> 01:59:10,939
What bullshit is that!

1255
01:59:11,144 --> 01:59:12,975
By the by, who the hell are you
to lecture about this?

1256
01:59:13,045 --> 01:59:15,013
Were you a master in 16008 LOVES?

1257
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:17,680
Hey, mind your words!

1258
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:20,342
Don't dare point your finger and talk!
Mind you!

1259
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:21,787
What's the problem here?

1260
01:59:22,255 --> 01:59:23,688
Nothing, we're learning about LOVE!

1261
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:25,221
You go and compose your next song.

1262
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:36,100
The LOVE you mean is trampling over
someone's life for an act in a left out moment!

1263
01:59:37,303 --> 01:59:38,463
lt's only 2 years since she has been in love!

1264
01:59:39,205 --> 01:59:42,008
l know those being in the
waiting room for 10-14 yrs,

1265
01:59:42,008 --> 01:59:45,000
and at last become insane realising that
their life has gone up in smoke.

1266
01:59:46,279 --> 01:59:49,180
By then life almost gets vaporized!

1267
01:59:49,282 --> 01:59:50,510
-Water vapour...-Yes Water vapour!

1268
01:59:52,084 --> 01:59:54,678
Let me ask you something!

1269
01:59:55,288 --> 01:59:59,088
Do you think your life will go waste
if you don't succeed in your love?

1270
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:01,490
ls there a huge scarcity
for men and women here?

1271
02:00:02,361 --> 02:00:05,330
-ls it? - That's enough!

1272
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:10,733
lf you again harp on this topic...

1273
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:13,703
Zakhariah, she doesn't know my nature.

1274
02:00:14,607 --> 02:00:18,634
-Shoe....My shoe!
-What shoo on this issue? Come!

1275
02:00:19,111 --> 02:00:21,807
-Did l talk less?
-Not at all!

1276
02:00:21,914 --> 02:00:24,712
Only you and Duva are the right ones
to talk about love!

1277
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:36,322
Yeah! So you recognized me!!

1278
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:39,521
l heard your speech as well.

1279
02:00:41,701 --> 02:00:47,333
So, only that much, is it? Okay!

1280
02:00:53,879 --> 02:01:02,344
Team DrC

1281
02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:25,877
We told him about
your yesterday's depression.

1282
02:01:51,637 --> 02:01:52,535
Dad!

1283
02:01:56,275 --> 02:02:02,305
lt's not about a Nawabian hangover
for giving value to one's words!!

1284
02:02:03,749 --> 02:02:06,877
But Cunning! Cent percent Cunning!!

1285
02:02:39,785 --> 02:02:40,683
With Love Nadira!

1286
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,227
What's this?

1287
02:02:51,564 --> 02:02:55,728
Nadira when you said you will wait,

1288
02:02:56,135 --> 02:02:57,534
l did not have a worry with that,

1289
02:02:58,471 --> 02:03:04,899
l knew with time your love will
evaporate in thin air,

1290
02:03:06,178 --> 02:03:08,669
and he knows this as well!

1291
02:03:09,982 --> 02:03:13,008
That's the reason why he has
started sending Dvds.

1292
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:15,017
That is what you think father!

1293
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:18,324
Even if we meet or not,

1294
02:03:18,324 --> 02:03:20,724
whether we hear each
other's voice or not....

1295
02:03:21,694 --> 02:03:24,254
our love will always live forever.

1296
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:28,601
l don't trust that! Do you believe in it?

1297
02:03:28,601 --> 02:03:29,431
Beyond the limit!

1298
02:03:30,136 --> 02:03:31,296
Do it and show

1299
02:03:57,763 --> 02:03:58,730
What else do you need?

1300
02:04:00,166 --> 02:04:01,793
Just one more thing.

1301
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:15,179
l'm Jaffar lmam speaking!

1302
02:04:33,766 --> 02:04:36,633
Give this to him on my behalf.

1303
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:57,213
l've not asked you this so far!

1304
02:04:57,823 --> 02:04:59,757
Dad, l never asked you
why are you so much against us,

1305
02:05:01,093 --> 02:05:02,685
just because he's a Hindu?

1306
02:05:02,895 --> 02:05:03,554
You're wrong.

1307
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:08,028
On my Naval base, my junior officer,

1308
02:05:08,667 --> 02:05:12,159
do such a thing with my
15 year old daughter?

1309
02:05:12,771 --> 02:05:14,204
l will never forgive that.

1310
02:05:14,773 --> 02:05:18,766
When you got married,
even mom wasjust 15 years old.

1311
02:05:19,812 --> 02:05:23,270
Did you wait to kiss hertill
she became 18 years?

1312
02:05:23,382 --> 02:05:24,007
Stop this nonsense!

1313
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:27,618
That was in old times!

1314
02:05:29,955 --> 02:05:31,320
Pack your suitcase!

1315
02:05:32,224 --> 02:05:33,782
We are leaving tomorrow.

1316
02:05:55,147 --> 02:05:56,136
Why did you call a taxi?

1317
02:05:56,749 --> 02:05:58,617
l would have dropped you at the airport.

1318
02:05:58,617 --> 02:06:00,380
-No...l..- l called the Taxi

1319
02:06:03,956 --> 02:06:05,423
You don't need to worry!

1320
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:08,217
l'm not going to Kerala,
l am going to Ajmer!

1321
02:06:09,795 --> 02:06:12,161
l have got a teacher's job in
Sufi center!

1322
02:06:12,665 --> 02:06:13,290
What do you mean?

1323
02:06:14,133 --> 02:06:17,364
if your decision changes, you
can come and meet me.

1324
02:06:18,504 --> 02:06:19,095
Sister!

1325
02:06:20,573 --> 02:06:22,063
The same applies to you as well!

1326
02:06:31,483 --> 02:06:34,077
When l saw you and learnt about you,

1327
02:06:36,455 --> 02:06:38,855
l immediately rushed to see my dad.

1328
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:43,322
Before l make any decision
l thought l would let you know.

1329
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:46,894
l'm taking Shantanu to Ajmer.

1330
02:06:50,102 --> 02:06:51,626
l'll get them married

1331
02:06:53,238 --> 02:06:54,000
Marriage?

1332
02:06:55,608 --> 02:06:57,906
Who are you to get them married?

1333
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:00,206
l'm Nadira lmam's brother.

1334
02:07:04,083 --> 02:07:05,414
When dad is not alive,

1335
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:08,913
Then, it's the responsibility of a brother
to take care of his sister.

1336
02:07:10,055 --> 02:07:17,120
Team DrC

1337
02:07:19,965 --> 02:07:20,989
Good thing,

1338
02:07:24,103 --> 02:07:29,063
l'm glad that you have more
affection towards your sister!

1339
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,338
Now you can leave!

1340
02:07:44,089 --> 02:07:47,024
Now, it's enough if l alone decide.

1341
02:07:47,393 --> 02:07:49,361
When shall we go to Ajmer?

1342
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,066
You will only lose in this, Naseeb.

1343
02:07:56,068 --> 02:08:01,563
lnfact Nawabian blood hangover
is not for your dad, Jaffar lmam,

1344
02:08:01,774 --> 02:08:02,570
but for your sister!

1345
02:08:03,776 --> 02:08:06,506
Her word.....the value she gives for it,

1346
02:08:08,247 --> 02:08:09,509
even her love towards me,

1347
02:08:09,782 --> 02:08:11,306
is the value of her word in the past!

1348
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:14,219
lmagine, l come along with you

1349
02:08:14,787 --> 02:08:18,655
Valuing the word she'd given her dad,
she'll not even bother to see me!

1350
02:08:19,792 --> 02:08:23,694
Anyhow, thanks for the kindness
you showed to me.

1351
02:08:25,597 --> 02:08:26,564
l will wait.

1352
02:08:28,734 --> 02:08:29,564
We will wait.

1353
02:08:32,271 --> 02:08:34,034
Whatever it is,
l don't have to shutterfor sure!

1354
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,336
That's enough.

1355
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:41,342
ln any case, let me give it a shot!

1356
02:08:43,615 --> 02:08:44,206
Bye!

1357
02:08:55,794 --> 02:08:57,352
What happened? What did that boy say?

1358
02:08:57,796 --> 02:09:00,026
Seems she is fine there.

1359
02:09:00,632 --> 02:09:02,327
Thank heavens!

1360
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:04,598
l had come here to tell you
something else also.

1361
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:07,595
Before that.. Sweet Kiss for you....

1362
02:09:08,307 --> 02:09:09,604
Why all this ?

1363
02:09:09,808 --> 02:09:10,172
There's a reason!

1364
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:12,070
Your dialogue yesterday was inspiring!

1365
02:09:12,311 --> 02:09:15,075
After hearing that,
Duva's mind has changed a bit!

1366
02:09:15,347 --> 02:09:18,339
Didn't l tell you
about an Engineer's proposal for her..

1367
02:09:18,617 --> 02:09:20,084
She's now agreed.

1368
02:09:20,619 --> 02:09:23,087
You sinner! What a mess!

1369
02:09:23,322 --> 02:09:26,291
O Koya! l blurted out in depression!

1370
02:09:27,059 --> 02:09:28,026
l want to meet Duva now.

1371
02:09:28,627 --> 02:09:29,252
Yes, What is up?

1372
02:09:30,629 --> 02:09:31,493
Do you know...

1373
02:09:31,630 --> 02:09:34,463
No boats will go to sea till tomorrow noon.

1374
02:09:34,633 --> 02:09:36,328
Some security problem, it seems!

1375
02:09:36,568 --> 02:09:38,160
ln the pretext of inspection,

1376
02:09:38,403 --> 02:09:39,597
Navy people took away
two boats that belonged to Sports!

1377
02:09:40,205 --> 02:09:41,832
''Manju'' that is scheduled to
leave Kozhikode tonight,

1378
02:09:42,274 --> 02:09:43,639
has been ordered to leave
only tomorrow afternoon.

1379
02:09:47,546 --> 02:09:56,113
Team DrC

1380
02:10:01,493 --> 02:10:03,085
-May l? - Yes.

1381
02:10:03,829 --> 02:10:07,094
Good evening, Doctor!
l'm Captain Rajan Jose!

1382
02:10:08,133 --> 02:10:12,092
lf there is any medical evacuation
for the next 48 hrs, you should inform us.

1383
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:15,231
What's the problem, sir?

1384
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:17,374
Sorry, l can't disclose to you.

1385
02:10:18,644 --> 02:10:19,372
Thank you.

1386
02:10:25,918 --> 02:10:27,647
4 cups of tea, please

1387
02:10:29,621 --> 02:10:31,521
Let me go and check the ship's schedule.

1388
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,358
Are they rushing on getting
any Tsunami information!

1389
02:10:43,802 --> 02:10:46,600
Only if the Tsunami arrival is kept a secret,
will the people get killed, right?

1390
02:10:53,278 --> 02:10:56,179
There are no ships for four days.

1391
02:10:56,615 --> 02:10:58,446
Oh Mother Mary! Do l've
to tolerate him forfour more days?

1392
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:07,216
NADlRA

1393
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:15,766
What are you doing?

1394
02:11:16,301 --> 02:11:17,268
lsn't Nadira in Ajmer now?

1395
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:19,801
Her SlM is with her dad, right?

1396
02:11:20,973 --> 02:11:23,601
This is not Nadira but Jaffar lmam!

1397
02:11:26,979 --> 02:11:27,843
Wait, don't take it now..

1398
02:11:28,647 --> 02:11:29,909
For the ruckus created by his son,

1399
02:11:30,282 --> 02:11:31,579
lt might be a plan to hook you, l suppose!

1400
02:11:31,783 --> 02:11:33,375
Let it be anything, attend the phone
before it gets cut.

1401
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:35,382
Put it on the speaker.

1402
02:11:42,794 --> 02:11:44,523
l'm Jaffar lmam speaking.

1403
02:11:45,631 --> 02:11:47,394
my daughter has a wrong belief

1404
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:50,261
that l will accept you before l die

1405
02:11:50,969 --> 02:11:52,596
that must be some other fathers

1406
02:11:52,971 --> 02:11:55,371
who might change their opinion as they die

1407
02:11:55,841 --> 02:11:57,468
l am not one of them,

1408
02:11:58,644 --> 02:12:00,703
My son also on your side...

1409
02:12:02,247 --> 02:12:03,874
for him l am dead long back,

1410
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:09,278
The situation is such that
l can't wait any longer,

1411
02:12:10,822 --> 02:12:14,781
Forthe sake of all,
l've to take up a decision .

1412
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:18,956
Now l will give you a chance.

1413
02:12:20,332 --> 02:12:21,356
Come to Kochi.

1414
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,627
Nadira and me are at Kochi

1415
02:12:24,236 --> 02:12:25,965
But only for the next 24 hours.

1416
02:12:27,339 --> 02:12:27,805
When?

1417
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:28,965
Tomorrow.

1418
02:12:31,343 --> 02:12:32,367
l will come.

1419
02:12:32,811 --> 02:12:33,869
You will not come.

1420
02:12:34,846 --> 02:12:35,608
l'll come.

1421
02:12:35,814 --> 02:12:36,781
How will you come?

1422
02:12:37,916 --> 02:12:38,678
Swimming?

1423
02:12:39,985 --> 02:12:42,385
Do you know the distance
between Kochi to Kavaratti?

1424
02:12:43,355 --> 02:12:46,290
218 nautical miles!

1425
02:12:47,659 --> 02:12:51,618
And for the next 4 days there are
no flights on hire,

1426
02:12:51,997 --> 02:12:53,624
and even if you leave immediately by boat,

1427
02:12:53,865 --> 02:12:58,529
it will still take you 48 hours.

1428
02:12:58,937 --> 02:13:02,304
l am waiting eagerly for you.

1429
02:13:03,342 --> 02:13:06,641
Even if l die, l will still come.

1430
02:13:07,012 --> 02:13:12,006
Promise me this talk will be
only between you and me,

1431
02:13:13,318 --> 02:13:15,479
it should not reach my kids.

1432
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:18,016
Do you agree with that?

1433
02:13:26,832 --> 02:13:27,730
l agree!

1434
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,401
l will wait for you ...eagerly!

1435
02:13:38,677 --> 02:13:40,872
Oh! All this commotion is
solely to block you!

1436
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:43,607
Let's not stand here anymore.

1437
02:13:43,815 --> 02:13:44,941
What's the problem?
What did he say?

1438
02:13:45,317 --> 02:13:47,478
l'll tell you! Come to the Lighthouse!

1439
02:13:50,222 --> 02:13:57,185
Team DrC

1440
02:13:59,898 --> 02:14:02,093
-Don't allow anybody to the lighthouse.
-Okay, sir.

1441
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:07,797
What a disaster is this!
Hell with his Challenge!!

1442
02:14:08,006 --> 02:14:09,496
Bloody 24 hrs time!
What bullshit is this!

1443
02:14:10,342 --> 02:14:11,934
He knows that even if he
blocks all the outlets,

1444
02:14:12,411 --> 02:14:14,038
you will do some adventures in the Sea.

1445
02:14:14,446 --> 02:14:16,038
At least in that way,
he wants you to be killed!

1446
02:14:16,648 --> 02:14:18,479
What adventure can he do in the Sea? Swim?

1447
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:20,417
Talk practically!

1448
02:14:20,652 --> 02:14:22,085
He has also hampered the boat service.

1449
02:14:22,988 --> 02:14:25,081
Even if boat-travel is possible,
based on his nature...

1450
02:14:25,457 --> 02:14:26,947
When you cross from the
territorial sea to the Open sea,

1451
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:28,621
...he is sure to have engaged
goondas to kill you!

1452
02:14:28,894 --> 02:14:30,384
Hardly would there be any
evidence left behind!

1453
02:14:30,996 --> 02:14:33,988
You will not go tomorrow!
What the hell will happen?

1454
02:14:34,366 --> 02:14:35,765
Dad and daughter will
go back the way they came!.

1455
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:38,435
Just because you didn't go there,
she is not going to marry somebody else!

1456
02:14:38,637 --> 02:14:40,468
Moreover, she is not aware
of all these happenings.

1457
02:14:40,839 --> 02:14:42,397
Whatever it is, rather than drowning and dying,

1458
02:14:43,675 --> 02:14:44,801
Waiting will be much better.

1459
02:14:45,177 --> 02:14:46,974
Let them run around and
sweat profusely for 24 hrs.

1460
02:14:52,818 --> 02:14:55,946
Nothing will happen if l don't go.

1461
02:14:57,155 --> 02:14:58,782
Nobody's life will be at risk!

1462
02:15:00,092 --> 02:15:04,426
As you said, she will go back
without being aware of the happenings.

1463
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:08,965
But...in case l am able to go..

1464
02:15:12,671 --> 02:15:14,571
..This waiting will end tomorrow.

1465
02:15:17,876 --> 02:15:21,744
That's why l promised to reach
there tomorrow risking my life.

1466
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:25,641
And it's not to prove my manliness
l am accepting his challenge!

1467
02:15:27,686 --> 02:15:28,812
lf l happen to die, let me die.

1468
02:15:29,688 --> 02:15:31,121
Only for this, l..

1469
02:15:36,428 --> 02:15:37,395
l must go

1470
02:15:43,802 --> 02:15:44,166
What happened?

1471
02:15:44,603 --> 02:15:46,070
A captain from the Navy has come...

1472
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:48,063
to inspect the Lighthouse right away.

1473
02:15:50,242 --> 02:15:53,211
You lift him up nicely and show him.
Let him inspect and go.

1474
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,041
-lf you let him inside, l'll kill you, mind it.
-Ask him to come tomorrow.

1475
02:15:58,083 --> 02:15:59,141
Planning to trap us from every side!

1476
02:15:59,784 --> 02:16:01,046
Seems the captain wants to inspect now.

1477
02:16:03,788 --> 02:16:04,812
So, you want to go.

1478
02:16:06,024 --> 02:16:07,821
Whatever you said, is right! You must go.

1479
02:16:09,194 --> 02:16:11,594
Koya! Suggest some way!

1480
02:16:12,697 --> 02:16:13,664
Suggest something!

1481
02:16:16,034 --> 02:16:18,662
There is a fisheries boat..in the Yard.

1482
02:16:19,037 --> 02:16:20,129
Work is almost completed!

1483
02:16:21,106 --> 02:16:22,733
lf you drive in full throttle,

1484
02:16:22,941 --> 02:16:25,239
You can reach there by tomorrow night.

1485
02:16:26,278 --> 02:16:29,736
But evading their sight, how
can l take the boat from Yard?

1486
02:16:29,948 --> 02:16:30,812
That's the second thing.

1487
02:16:31,016 --> 02:16:31,983
First is Hussain!

1488
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:34,013
Come...Come l say!

1489
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:36,244
Don't hang around, Come Koya!

1490
02:16:36,788 --> 02:16:42,420
Team DrC

1491
02:16:42,727 --> 02:16:44,092
Here comes Shantanu sir!

1492
02:16:45,163 --> 02:16:46,562
Come! Come!
Oh! All of you are here!

1493
02:16:50,235 --> 02:16:50,894
-ls Hussain there in the Qawwali?
-He'll be there!

1494
02:17:05,217 --> 02:17:07,185
Sir...that will not work out..
Let's move.

1495
02:17:07,919 --> 02:17:09,079
-What happened?
-Propeller is ...

1496
02:17:09,221 --> 02:17:10,119
Won't it be enough if we bring it here?

1497
02:17:10,322 --> 02:17:11,755
Will your dad go and bring it from Kochi

1498
02:17:12,724 --> 02:17:13,691
He was calling me SlR so far,

1499
02:17:14,059 --> 02:17:15,026
and calling me names now?

1500
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:28,831
Both of them are over the
phone for a long time.

1501
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:30,107
Do you think it will work out?

1502
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:32,305
What happened?

1503
02:17:32,877 --> 02:17:34,572
l called up Sherin!
l didn't disclose anything!!

1504
02:17:34,713 --> 02:17:36,271
l can't reveal your name to her

1505
02:17:36,715 --> 02:17:38,273
There are no possibilities for
Evacuation tomorrow.

1506
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:40,845
Or if it is for today,
then someone must get heart attack!!

1507
02:17:41,052 --> 02:17:41,848
Most probably it would be me!!

1508
02:17:43,154 --> 02:17:44,280
Navy people had gone there also!

1509
02:17:45,056 --> 02:17:47,752
Any Evacuation order can be done
only after informing them!

1510
02:17:48,226 --> 02:17:49,193
So, that idea is also ruled out.

1511
02:17:59,304 --> 02:18:00,669
Will you stop this bloody laughing?

1512
02:18:04,142 --> 02:18:05,268
We'll surely win, sir!

1513
02:18:06,711 --> 02:18:11,307
My friend's friend Farid, has a yacht!

1514
02:18:11,683 --> 02:18:12,843
He is an avid racertoo!

1515
02:18:13,051 --> 02:18:15,144
l only told them that it is for a bet
to reach Kochi tomorrow!

1516
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,812
He demanded 2.5 lakhs!

1517
02:18:17,055 --> 02:18:17,714
And l fixed it for 2 lakhs!

1518
02:18:17,922 --> 02:18:20,823
-Any problem?
-What problem? Tell me the rest.

1519
02:18:21,726 --> 02:18:24,854
At early morning, 5 am he will
come to the 2nd buoy next to the Reef!

1520
02:18:25,063 --> 02:18:26,826
To go there, we have to row the fibre boat

1521
02:18:27,232 --> 02:18:29,826
He has promised to reach
Kochi by tomorrow evening 5' 0 clock.

1522
02:18:33,071 --> 02:18:35,869
To reach yard at 5 am,
we must leave at least by 2 a.m.

1523
02:18:36,074 --> 02:18:38,042
l'll also come with you as there will be
a rapid flow of water during that time.

1524
02:18:43,048 --> 02:18:46,017
Surely you will win! lf not you, who else?

1525
02:18:47,018 --> 02:18:50,010
lmmediately bring your fibre boat
and fasten it there.

1526
02:18:52,157 --> 02:18:53,886
lt's necessary!

1527
02:18:56,728 --> 02:18:58,389
lsn't there a bulb glowing
on that corner post?

1528
02:18:58,897 --> 02:18:59,955
Hit and break it!

1529
02:19:00,732 --> 02:19:01,699
Koya! Those people are there.

1530
02:19:02,934 --> 02:19:04,026
They are after us only.

1531
02:19:43,742 --> 02:19:44,333
Hold this.

1532
02:19:45,744 --> 02:19:47,041
We don't have to wait until
it is 1'O' clock

1533
02:19:47,445 --> 02:19:49,106
Any moment those people may come in.

1534
02:19:49,914 --> 02:19:51,677
Yes! Come, let's move.

1535
02:19:53,284 --> 02:19:54,216
Come quickly.

1536
02:19:55,887 --> 02:19:57,752
They don't patrol because of rain

1537
02:19:59,958 --> 02:20:01,118
Call me immediately, while boarding the yacht.

1538
02:20:14,105 --> 02:20:14,901
Gosh! Was it you?

1539
02:20:15,306 --> 02:20:17,069
-What happened?
- Here they go.

1540
02:20:34,759 --> 02:20:35,726
What do you feel, dude?

1541
02:20:36,094 --> 02:20:36,958
Feel like sleeping!

1542
02:20:37,162 --> 02:20:37,992
lt's 4'0 clock!

1543
02:20:38,196 --> 02:20:39,128
Wait for one more hour.

1544
02:20:39,364 --> 02:20:40,194
Let him call.

1545
02:20:41,099 --> 02:20:42,430
Wake me up when he calls.

1546
02:20:50,008 --> 02:20:53,171
Hello! Jeez!

1547
02:20:59,250 --> 02:20:59,944
Shucks!

1548
02:21:01,085 --> 02:21:01,517
What happened?

1549
02:21:02,086 --> 02:21:02,711
Come.

1550
02:21:22,574 --> 02:21:24,132
Navy people seized the Yacht!

1551
02:21:24,576 --> 02:21:27,136
They will let it off only tomorrow after
checking the papers and permit.

1552
02:21:27,345 --> 02:21:30,178
When we were half the way,
Farid had called so we returned.

1553
02:21:34,252 --> 02:21:39,485
Let her.....Ler her go back, dude.

1554
02:21:41,926 --> 02:21:42,893
What you said was right.

1555
02:21:44,329 --> 02:21:47,924
Even if l don't go, nothing will happen

1556
02:21:51,069 --> 02:21:56,200
But...For me, nothing more can happen!

1557
02:21:59,110 --> 02:22:00,077
But you..

1558
02:22:01,246 --> 02:22:02,907
Koya, why did you inform them now?

1559
02:22:03,248 --> 02:22:04,340
Couldn't you tell them in the morning?

1560
02:22:06,851 --> 02:22:10,309
lt's almost dawn. All of you go.

1561
02:22:14,259 --> 02:22:17,490
l want to lie down. l'm very tired.

1562
02:22:18,963 --> 02:22:20,828
Shall l also sleep with him today?

1563
02:22:21,366 --> 02:22:23,231
No...l'll sleep.

1564
02:22:26,938 --> 02:22:28,064
-Shall l? - No, leave.

1565
02:22:34,979 --> 02:22:46,447
Team DrC

1566
02:22:58,336 --> 02:22:59,303
Have you decided not to go?

1567
02:23:01,105 --> 02:23:01,901
l must go.

1568
02:23:03,942 --> 02:23:04,431
How?

1569
02:23:06,477 --> 02:23:09,640
Need to use a bag of tricks like earlier days!

1570
02:23:11,182 --> 02:23:12,149
As l intended!

1571
02:23:13,985 --> 02:23:15,043
Evacuation!

1572
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:20,450
The patient is..

1573
02:23:20,692 --> 02:23:21,351
You or me?

1574
02:23:22,627 --> 02:23:23,457
Me only.

1575
02:23:25,129 --> 02:23:27,461
But, what is your illness?

1576
02:23:33,137 --> 02:23:36,231
Not illness! But suicide attempt!

1577
02:23:37,642 --> 02:23:39,109
Reason - Love failure!

1578
02:23:42,046 --> 02:23:42,978
Will it work?

1579
02:23:44,616 --> 02:23:48,347
But that devil Sherin...
You've odds with her now..

1580
02:23:49,621 --> 02:23:50,883
l can tackle her.

1581
02:23:51,623 --> 02:23:53,022
..but l need your support as well.

1582
02:23:54,626 --> 02:23:58,221
We two only, No one else.

1583
02:23:59,631 --> 02:24:01,258
Even Rajeev and Koya
should not know about this.

1584
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:05,260
Only then they will be
able to react naturally.

1585
02:24:17,415 --> 02:24:29,225
Team DrC

1586
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:35,028
Shantanu ditched us. Rush up.

1587
02:24:44,275 --> 02:24:50,236
Oh Rajeev! My God! Shantanu
ditched us. Come quickly.

1588
02:24:50,748 --> 02:24:52,147
We need to inform the Police.
Come quickly.

02:24:59,123 --> 02:25:01,353
Oh God! Please help......Please help...

1590
02:25:02,627 --> 02:25:04,060
lt's like chanting hymns!

1591
02:25:07,999 --> 02:25:10,365
Oh my God! Who is here to hear?.

1592
02:25:14,439 --> 02:25:18,398
Please help....Help, please.

1593
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:33,386
Oh my bro! Shantanu sir ditched us!

1594
02:25:33,825 --> 02:25:35,383
Save him at any cost.

1595
02:25:35,827 --> 02:25:38,455
Call the people quickly.
Rush....Call the people.

1596
02:25:44,135 --> 02:25:46,399
Shantanu sir inhaled something!

1597
02:25:47,638 --> 02:25:49,765
Oh my God! Give some first aid to him.
Go quickly.

1598
02:25:52,110 --> 02:25:54,078
My hands and legs are trembling!
Oh God!

1599
02:25:54,645 --> 02:25:57,011
Sir! lt's Poison!

1600
02:25:57,215 --> 02:25:58,182
l know that, you fool!

1601
02:25:59,317 --> 02:26:00,784
Are you kneading Paratha on his chest?

1602
02:26:01,252 --> 02:26:03,186
Sir, call the ambulance quickly.

1603
02:26:04,822 --> 02:26:06,380
Hey, no range for BSNL here!

1604
02:26:11,362 --> 02:26:12,522
l don't get anybody overthe phone...
Oh my God!

1605
02:26:12,830 --> 02:26:13,797
What on earth will l do now?

1606
02:26:16,334 --> 02:26:17,392
Give him some first aid.

1607
02:26:17,835 --> 02:26:21,168
Whom shall l call now?
-Call the Police!

1608
02:26:26,144 --> 02:26:28,806
Shantanu sir inhaled poisonous gas!
What will l do now?

1609
02:26:29,313 --> 02:26:30,245
Run quickly.

1610
02:26:30,815 --> 02:26:31,679
Let me call somebody for help.

1611
02:26:38,156 --> 02:26:39,123
Wasn't that you who announced
n the mike that day?

1612
02:26:39,323 --> 02:26:40,051
Go and announce quickly

1613
02:26:40,424 --> 02:26:41,118
ls he dead, then?

1614
02:26:41,325 --> 02:26:42,292
l'll give you a smack! Go and announce.

1615
02:26:45,329 --> 02:26:46,296
lnform the Pilot immediately.

1616
02:26:46,664 --> 02:26:49,531
-Pilot?-Go and call quickly, Rascal

1617
02:26:52,170 --> 02:26:54,138
Don't waste time and risk his life.

1618
02:26:56,374 --> 02:26:58,501
Oh my God! Atta has come!

1619
02:27:00,178 --> 02:27:02,271
Oh my Atta! Look what Shantanu has done!

1620
02:27:02,647 --> 02:27:04,114
ls there any need for him to do this?

1621
02:27:05,316 --> 02:27:06,476
Can't he at least tell me once?

1622
02:27:07,318 --> 02:27:09,081
What the hell you were doing here, then?

1623
02:27:09,387 --> 02:27:10,877
Had he given me any hint,
l would've stayed awake!

1624
02:27:12,390 --> 02:27:16,622
He only told me it's a poisonous gas.

1625
02:27:16,828 --> 02:27:17,795
Why did he do this knowingly?

1626
02:27:19,397 --> 02:27:21,388
No point in pressing!
Give him artificial breathing through mouth!

1627
02:27:21,632 --> 02:27:21,893
Me?

1628
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:23,389
Oh no! Get aside.

1629
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:24,858
Give me the phone.

1630
02:27:29,874 --> 02:27:30,772
Here the Police has arrived

1631
02:27:31,142 --> 02:27:33,872
Hello Sherin, Where are you?
Quarters?

1632
02:27:35,146 --> 02:27:36,408
Carry him soon!

1633
02:27:40,651 --> 02:27:41,208
Move...move

1634
02:27:41,652 --> 02:27:43,119
Yes, it's Carbon-mono-oxide!

1635
02:27:43,821 --> 02:27:44,753
l'm not sure of that.

1636
02:27:45,323 --> 02:27:46,381
Keep the cylinder in the vehicle.

1637
02:27:47,758 --> 02:27:51,216
Ask the doctor not to treat him here...

1638
02:27:51,429 --> 02:27:52,794
Send him to Kochi as early as possible.

1639
02:27:56,667 --> 02:27:57,497
Zakhariah, get in.

1640
02:27:57,869 --> 02:27:59,234
Keep the cylinder inside.
Doctor has to get in.

1641
02:28:01,806 --> 02:28:02,500
l will feel suffocated there..

1642
02:28:08,312 --> 02:28:09,279
Move quickly.

1643
02:28:11,382 --> 02:28:13,680
Somebody call the doctor and
ask her to keep everything ready.

1644
02:28:14,652 --> 02:28:15,676
Speed up, you rascal!

1645
02:28:16,821 --> 02:28:17,685
Don't take away his life!

1646
02:28:29,667 --> 02:28:31,897
He has inhaled Carbon monoxide!
lt's poisonous!

1647
02:28:32,303 --> 02:28:34,294
He himself told me that one who inhales,
will not survive more than 4 hrs

1648
02:28:34,672 --> 02:28:36,572
Not sure what time
he has taken this in the morning.

1649
02:28:37,675 --> 02:28:38,642
So it was deliberate!

1650
02:28:39,010 --> 02:28:40,238
Will anyone do it for fun?

1651
02:28:43,247 --> 02:28:43,872
Doctor, just a minute.

1652
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:50,612
Planning to take away his life,
keeping him here?

1653
02:28:50,955 --> 02:28:52,445
Calm down.. Let me talk to the Doctor.

1654
02:28:56,661 --> 02:28:58,561
What's this, Rajeev?
What is his problem?

1655
02:28:58,863 --> 02:29:00,558
From the beginning,
l felt some abnormality in him

1656
02:29:01,265 --> 02:29:02,789
He doesn't have any
consistency as a whole.

1657
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:03,898
l shall brief you!

1658
02:29:04,268 --> 02:29:06,930
But don't keep the last day incident
in your mind and be prejudiced!

1659
02:29:07,338 --> 02:29:08,202
Rajeev, you tell me.

1660
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:10,432
lt was a Suicide attempt.

1661
02:29:11,375 --> 02:29:12,603
His situation was so bad.

1662
02:29:14,345 --> 02:29:16,313
lt is an 11 yr old love affair!

1663
02:29:21,252 --> 02:29:41,629
Team DrC

1664
02:29:55,019 --> 02:29:56,316
Please move...Move....

1665
02:29:56,554 --> 02:29:58,920
Don'tjust stand and lecture,
please try to save him.

1666
02:30:07,698 --> 02:30:09,666
What? What happened?

1667
02:30:14,705 --> 02:30:15,797
How will l endure this?

1668
02:30:17,041 --> 02:30:19,532
Without even a hint...he inhaled..

1669
02:30:20,044 --> 02:30:22,035
Let's ask the Doctor...Ask the doctor.

1670
02:30:23,681 --> 02:30:24,648
Call the helicopter, please.

1671
02:30:25,349 --> 02:30:26,407
Sir..Calm down...sit there.

1672
02:30:26,851 --> 02:30:28,045
How am l going to bear this?

1673
02:30:38,763 --> 02:30:41,288
So, it was not to die!
But taken a chance!!

1674
02:30:41,699 --> 02:30:43,064
lf destined to reach,
he will reach, isn't it?

1675
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:48,429
Ready to take any risk forfriend's love!

1676
02:30:48,606 --> 02:30:50,073
But not for your own sister!

1677
02:30:51,675 --> 02:30:53,643
l hate seeing this fellow.
Get away.

1678
02:30:56,414 --> 02:30:58,541
Pass on the information to the Helipad.

1679
02:30:58,916 --> 02:30:59,940
l'm going to orderfor evacuation.

1680
02:31:01,952 --> 02:31:02,509
Please move.

1681
02:31:09,693 --> 02:31:12,423
lf you are ready to sacrifice life for love,
you will find many girls in your hometown!

1682
02:31:12,696 --> 02:31:14,425
What is the need for you to go up to Lucknow?

1683
02:31:15,366 --> 02:31:17,800
Oh, sorry! l am not suppose to
talk a word about LOVE!

1684
02:31:22,673 --> 02:31:23,571
Please move.

1685
02:31:26,677 --> 02:31:27,644
What's happening here?

1686
02:31:27,912 --> 02:31:30,073
This is Casualty! Wait outside.

1687
02:31:30,481 --> 02:31:31,641
Okay...Wait outside.

1688
02:31:32,683 --> 02:31:34,412
Tell me what happened to the patient.

1689
02:31:34,685 --> 02:31:35,652
Who are you to ask that?

1690
02:31:37,688 --> 02:31:38,985
Jamal, here is the evacuation order.

1691
02:31:39,890 --> 02:31:42,051
No, doctor. lt's a fake case.

1692
02:31:42,693 --> 02:31:43,660
What nonsense is he talking?

1693
02:31:43,861 --> 02:31:44,953
lt's not you who should decide it.

1694
02:31:45,196 --> 02:31:46,424
You're not a doctor, are you?

1695
02:31:46,664 --> 02:31:48,859
l'm not a doctor, but l've
got a Navy doctor with me.

1696
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:49,828
Let him examine him.

1697
02:31:50,034 --> 02:31:51,524
Who the hell are you to order me?

1698
02:31:51,702 --> 02:31:52,964
l'm the Medical Superintendent.

1699
02:31:53,170 --> 02:31:54,660
lt's not Navy that pays me the salary.

1700
02:31:55,206 --> 02:31:57,800
And it's my discretion,
to certify the evacuation.

1701
02:31:58,008 --> 02:31:58,997
Evacuation is your...

1702
02:31:59,210 --> 02:32:01,405
Let the Navy doctor attend
only Navy people, clear?

1703
02:32:01,679 --> 02:32:02,646
Get out.

1704
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:05,644
Doctor, Evacuation you can decide.

1705
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:08,512
But l should decide whether
the helicopter should fly or not!

1706
02:32:08,853 --> 02:32:10,081
You don't have to decide about that,

1707
02:32:10,488 --> 02:32:11,147
that'll fly by itself.

1708
02:32:11,689 --> 02:32:13,589
Moreover Helicopter doesn't
belong to the Navy.

1709
02:32:13,691 --> 02:32:16,091
lt's the Air ambulance of
Lakshwadeep Administration.

1710
02:32:16,861 --> 02:32:19,955
Jamal, call the collector before
they plan up for something else.

1711
02:32:20,164 --> 02:32:22,155
-Pilot?-Go and call quickly, Rascal

1712
02:32:26,570 --> 02:32:28,663
Listen, doctor! ls he really serious?

1713
02:32:28,873 --> 02:32:30,807
Yes! Cent percent sure.

1714
02:32:44,722 --> 02:32:49,853
No, sir! Till now, l've been
obeying your orders as a Junior officer.

1715
02:32:50,261 --> 02:32:51,853
Now l refuse to do it.

1716
02:32:52,129 --> 02:32:54,097
And also would like to inform you that

1717
02:32:54,732 --> 02:32:57,166
lndian Navy is not an
organization to dance,

1718
02:32:57,568 --> 02:32:59,035
according to somebody's whims
and fancies, sir.

1719
02:32:59,737 --> 02:33:00,669
Hail lndia!

1720
02:33:02,039 --> 02:33:04,530
Get the ambulance quickly.

1721
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:08,001
-How does he feel now?
-Quite critical!

1722
02:33:08,712 --> 02:33:09,679
What about the evacuation?

1723
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:11,006
Order will be passed right now.

1724
02:33:11,215 --> 02:33:14,241
Thank heavens! l'm relieved!
Tomorrow l've a programme.

1725
02:33:14,585 --> 02:33:16,849
So, l can also join them in the
helicopter, right?

1726
02:33:18,722 --> 02:33:21,589
You bloody bitch! Hell with his programme!

1727
02:33:21,959 --> 02:33:23,085
l'll kick you down!

1728
02:33:24,061 --> 02:33:25,085
Even if there is a vacant seat,

1729
02:33:25,296 --> 02:33:26,888
l'm ready to occupy a donkey but not you.

1730
02:33:27,998 --> 02:33:29,056
Don't you understand the situation, sir!

1731
02:33:29,733 --> 02:33:32,463
l just asked him whether
l could go with them.

1732
02:33:37,741 --> 02:33:39,709
No no this is fraud ,

1733
02:33:41,912 --> 02:33:43,004
You cannot do this ,

1734
02:33:45,716 --> 02:33:47,547
He is making a fool of everyone!

1735
02:33:51,722 --> 02:33:52,086
Okay!

1736
02:33:53,724 --> 02:33:54,281
Let the scoundrel come!

1737
02:33:57,061 --> 02:33:59,029
As he comes he will go behind bars,
bloody Madrasi!

1738
02:34:10,074 --> 02:34:11,939
What is this new drama, dad?

1739
02:34:13,210 --> 02:34:15,178
You bought me here saying that

1740
02:34:15,713 --> 02:34:18,841
you will talk to Shantanu
and find a way out.

1741
02:34:20,217 --> 02:34:22,082
But l don't see anything of that sort,

1742
02:34:23,153 --> 02:34:26,088
l can't talk to a traitor.

1743
02:34:37,234 --> 02:34:38,132
Hello!

1744
02:34:41,071 --> 02:34:52,915
Team DrC

1745
02:34:58,289 --> 02:34:59,187
Dad!

1746
02:35:00,157 --> 02:35:01,681
Whatever he did is wrong!

1747
02:35:02,059 --> 02:35:02,650
He betrayed us

1748
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:03,890
Fraud!

1749
02:35:05,029 --> 02:35:06,792
He did not keep his word,

1750
02:35:06,997 --> 02:35:08,123
broke a promise!

1751
02:35:08,399 --> 02:35:10,026
Promise, trust...?

1752
02:35:10,734 --> 02:35:11,962
Stop playing this game!

1753
02:35:13,604 --> 02:35:15,037
You are the one who cheated us, dad!

1754
02:35:26,717 --> 02:35:28,378
Listen to me very carefully.

1755
02:35:28,886 --> 02:35:33,118
Shantanu has to reach here unharmed,

1756
02:35:34,892 --> 02:35:36,883
at any cost, before me ...!

1757
02:35:40,164 --> 02:35:42,132
lf he doesn't come before me alive..

1758
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:06,679
Move all of you.

1759
02:36:06,924 --> 02:36:08,983
Move...Bring him quickly.

1760
02:36:09,993 --> 02:36:10,322
Make it fast.

1761
02:36:14,932 --> 02:36:15,330
You get in first.

1762
02:36:19,937 --> 02:36:20,335
Lift him.

1763
02:36:38,288 --> 02:36:39,448
My dear...Come..

1764
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:43,186
-Come dear - Go..

1765
02:36:48,932 --> 02:36:49,762
You go..

1766
02:37:02,179 --> 02:37:02,668
Come...get inside.

1767
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:03,876
Come..

1768
02:37:21,265 --> 02:37:21,924

1769
02:37:50,227 --> 02:37:59,693
Team DrC

1770
02:38:20,591 --> 02:38:23,185
What happened to her dad's 24 hrs!!
Finished?

1771
02:38:25,195 --> 02:38:27,356
He is perfectly alright!
Just acting!

1772
02:38:30,934 --> 02:38:31,298
Oh my God!

1773
02:38:33,971 --> 02:38:36,235
Because of our ploys,
your love blossomed!

1774
02:38:36,607 --> 02:38:38,438
Let's go there and see
if his love will blossom or not!

1775
02:38:41,245 --> 02:38:42,906
Look how shocked this fool is!

1776
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:46,206
lt's not fair!
You could've at least told me...

1777
02:38:46,583 --> 02:38:48,050
lf l'd told you, then you will
collapse everything by your act.

1778
02:38:48,318 --> 02:38:50,115
See! l'm travelling to Kochi in dhothi!

1779
02:38:52,089 --> 02:38:52,885
Enough of acting!

1780
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:54,557
They are not going to
land the helicopter here.

1781
02:39:00,597 --> 02:39:02,428
You rascal! Have you cheated me?

1782
02:39:03,267 --> 02:39:04,996
Thinking it was a game only
l supported you.

1783
02:39:05,602 --> 02:39:06,569
ls this a game?

1784
02:39:07,971 --> 02:39:08,995
Hurry up, please.

1785
02:39:10,607 --> 02:39:12,575
Do you want to risk your life by fooling me?

1786
02:39:18,015 --> 02:39:19,312
l can't take any chance in this anymore.

1787
02:39:20,284 --> 02:39:25,221
By this...if it ends also, l'll be happy.

1788
02:39:25,622 --> 02:39:26,589
Oh my Jesus!

1789
02:39:29,192 --> 02:39:30,159
Don't worry, dude!!

1790
02:39:34,298 --> 02:39:35,162
Hurry up...

1791
02:39:38,635 --> 02:39:39,602
Put him the mask.

1792
02:40:15,505 --> 02:40:19,202
Team DrC

1793
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:24,338
He's a fraud! Arrest that man.

1794
02:40:25,349 --> 02:40:26,077
lt's all drama!

1795
02:40:26,350 --> 02:40:27,908
Will you please shut up? He is dying

1796
02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:41,097
Come...Come on...fast.

1797
02:40:42,299 --> 02:40:42,958
Come on..

1798
02:41:46,096 --> 02:41:48,394
l just prayed to God that
you won't have to cry.

1799
02:43:15,218 --> 02:43:22,021
Team DrC

1800
02:43:42,212 --> 02:43:45,181
A saint in a Sufi centre said that as a joke,

1801
02:43:46,149 --> 02:43:49,346
about the coincidence hidden
behind our names!

1802
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:53,455
lt seems Anarkali's real name was Nadira,

1803
02:43:54,391 --> 02:43:58,623
and Salim refers to Shantanu(PEACE)

1804
02:44:00,797 --> 02:44:02,628
Anarkali and Salim!

1805
02:44:05,735 --> 02:44:11,435
Anyhow, thanks to God
for rescuing me from death!

1806
02:44:12,742 --> 02:44:15,609
LOVE - is also as strong as DEATH!
