1
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:30,822
This is Fatehpur Sikri,
founded by King Akbar.

2
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:36,203
There is a strange appeal
in its silence and desolation.

3
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,789
A kind of magic.

4
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,209
That is why l keep
getting drawn here, ...

5
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,795
... and still don't
feel satiated.

6
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,770
l am very tired, sister-in-law,
serve me tea.

7
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,148
-Go, get the stuff from the car.
-Me? lmpossible!

8
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,777
l cannot walk any more,
Leela, you go and get it.

9
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,989
Don't you feel ashamed?
lmpossible indeed!

10
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,785
Who asked you to insist
that we see everything in a day?

11
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,789
And now? l am tired,
l cannot walk anymore'!

12
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,165
Shameless!

13
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,168
What! Did you
hear that, sister-in-law?

14
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,170
Why do you pay
attention to that nut?

15
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,800
- Where are you going?
- To get the food.

16
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:41,805
- l'll go...
- Wait. l'll go.

17
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,188
Don't touch it!

18
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,815
Brother!

19
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,193
- lsn't that Leela's voice?
- Yes.

20
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,823
Don't be afraid, dear.

21
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,744
l was forbidding you ...

22
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,748
- ... so that your hands
don't touch blood. - Blood?

23
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,168
- Yes, blood.
- What nonsense are you talking?

24
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:15,172
l am not talking nonsense,
l am speaking the truth.

25
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:21,178
There is a tale of blood
in every stone here.

26
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,765
Tale of blood...in every stone.

27
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,187
- You'd come to see
Fatehpur Sikri? - Yes.

28
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,773
- Have you finished going around?
- Yes.

29
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,777
Did you see Lal Pathar'
(red stone)?

30
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,780
- Lal Pathar?
- Yes, Lal Pathar.

31
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,199
All the stones here are red.

32
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:47,788
No, l am not talking
about all the stones.

33
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:56,213
l am talking about only those two
stones which are red as blood.

34
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,800
Did you see those two stones?

35
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,135
But the guide book
doesn't mention any such...

36
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,727
Does the guide book mention
how many conspiracies, ...

37
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,771
... how many murders,
were committed here?

38
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,733
How many lovers met here
and parted ways?

39
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:22,155
Does it mention the story
of Negro Suleiman?

40
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:28,161
Does it mention Kurshid and
Mubarrak's woeful story?

41
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,163
No, it doesn't.

42
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,169
Likewise, even those two
red stones are not mentioned.

43
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:41,758
But does that make it a lie?

44
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,178
Will that make it a lie?

45
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,773
- Shall l ask you something?
- What?

46
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,737
- Who are you?
- Why do you ask?

47
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,156
No reason.
Just like that.

48
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,159
- lntroduce yourself.
- lntroduce?

49
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,163
l tried hard to forget.

50
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,749
Very hard.

51
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:21,757
But where am l able to forget?
l'm not able to forget.

52
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,762
- Can you give me some water?
- Sure.

53
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,144
Here.

54
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,194
Blood!....blood!

55
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,734
- What is in this?
- Tea.

56
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,157
He speaks Hindi and
English very fluently.

57
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,160
Could he be some bandit?

58
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,745
Shh! He may hear you.

59
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,171
Will you hear the historic
story of that red stone?

60
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,757
Even we want to hear.
Please tell us.

61
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,761
- Yes, please tell us.
- But it's getting late.

62
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:56,768
Sir, everyone sees the
Taj Mahal by moonlight.

63
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:03,150
But if you don't see
Fatehpur Sikri by moonlight ...

64
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,736
... you have seen
nothing in Agra.

65
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,115
You are right. lt's a full moon
night. And then, we have a car.

66
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,743
Please tell us.

67
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
Sure.

68
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,751
Rainagar's history was strange.

69
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:26,131
The first man of the
royal family of Rainagar ...

70
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,134
... King Raghav Shanker Rai ...

71
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,764
... was a
cruel and brutal bandit.

72
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,709
Break open the door!

73
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,140
Wow!

74
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,143
You all go to the other room.

75
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,731
Sonmai,
l was looking for you.

76
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:36,743
You cannot escape me today.

77
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,754
When Gyanshanker,
the only male heir ...

78
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,755
... of the 7th generation
of the Rai family...

79
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:53,177
... was eight years old ...

80
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,188
- Hey! Who are you?
- Kokha.

81
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,191
Anand's son?
...Who am l?

82
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,984
- Grandfather.
- Yes!

83
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:16,200
Don't ever go there, you'll get
the curse of Queen Sonmai.

84
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:21,205
l have sent an appeal to the
Emperor abroad ...

85
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,791
... that Anand has imprisoned me.

86
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,794
Don't tell anyone.

87
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:35,802
Son, when you grow up,
get an education.

88
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:39,806
And be good to your subjects.

89
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:44,811
Mom, why has father
imprisoned grandfather?

90
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,021
No, dear.

91
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,232
- Because he has gone mad?
- Yes.

92
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,819
- Why does one go mad?
- lt's a kind of sickness.

93
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,822
Mom, why had
Queen Sonmai cursed us?

94
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,787
- Who told you?
- Haricharan, & even grandfather.

95
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,957
You will understand when
you grow up. Now go to sleep.

96
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,750
- Tell me!
- Go to sleep, Kokha.

97
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,795
l'll go and serve
dinner to your father.

98
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,765
Leave me!

99
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,779
Come here.

100
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,199
Let her go, father!

101
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:47,791
Hurry! Run!

102
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,218
After this incident,
Gyanshanker's mother ...

103
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:03,765
... sent him to his uncle
in Allahabad.

104
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,769
The uncle was a bachelor ...

105
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,773
... and a professor of
psychology in the university.

106
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,193
Gyanshanker grew up there...

107
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,198
... and became a double graduate
in Psychology and History.

108
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:27,789
The father, a cruel man,
and the mother, an angel.

109
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:31,793
Gyanshanker grew up with
the blood of ...

110
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,214
... two opposite personalities
running in his veins.

111
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,821
Sit down.

112
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,158
Raja Bahadur of Kanchanpur
has sent a message ...

113
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,161
... that he
cannot wait any longer.

114
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,371
Why?

115
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,164
He says the
princess has grown up.

116
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,374
Anything else?

117
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,752
The Governor is coming
to Barrackpur this month.

118
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,172
- He wants to meet you.
- l will meet him.

119
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,174
And also present
him a cheque ...

120
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,176
... of Rs.100000 for
the government hospital.

121
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,805
And also recommended the
title of Raja Bahadur (king) ...

122
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,181
... for yourself on new year eve.

123
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,769
But Kumar (prince),
until you don't marry ...

124
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,771
l won't get the
title of Raja Bahadur.

125
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,775
Divan uncle, you are aware
that l won't marry.

126
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:41,196
Write to the Raja of
Kanchanpur ...

127
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,199
... to get his daughter
married elsewhere.

128
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,202
Where the
title is concerned, ...

129
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:51,790
... l'll remain
Kumar Bahadur in this birth.

130
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,795
You are aware of the
curse of Queen Sonmai.

131
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,134
l don't want the lineage
of this mad family to continue.

132
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,345
Sir, some men
have come from Sultanpur.

133
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,139
They say the
lion has attacked again.

134
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,787
Welcome, Kumar Bahadur!

135
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,791
- Hello.
- Hello.

136
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,170
We are in the
jungle since 5 days ...

137
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,798
... and you want to kill
the lion in a day?

138
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,802
That's what l intend,
and then, l have your support.

139
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,806
That's true!
Come, first enjoy our welcome.

140
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,808
Give us an
opportunity to serve you.

141
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,742
- Please sit down.
- Please be seated.

142
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,748
What would you like to drink?

143
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,752
l don't drink.

144
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,172
What kind of a joke is this?

145
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:27,177
Everyone here takes your family
name before opening a bottle.

146
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:32,182
You should have more liquor
running in your veins than blood.

147
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,184
So don't be formal.

148
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:39,189
Gulabjan, he is the Prince of
Rainagar, Gyanshanker Rai.

149
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,774
Salute him.

150
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,197
ls this what you have
been hunting since 5 days?

151
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,784
You are right. Watch the deer
being hunted ...

152
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,786
... before hunting
for the lion.

153
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,137
Come!

154
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,145
l'll show you
an evening in heaven

155
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,738
Come and rest among tresses

156
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,160
Come!

157
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:15,160
Even flowers cannot match
the colour of my body

158
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:20,165
l'm a rose that has made
this party fragrant

159
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:24,753
My style, my anklets,
my alluring songs

160
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,132
Everything about me
is incomparable

161
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,180
Meet my eyes,
get intoxicated

162
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,769
So come!

163
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:23,145
You have come into this world
for a short while, so enjoy

164
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:27,733
Who knows what
tomorrow will bring

165
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,738
Life cannot be trusted,
l swear

166
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:37,159
These joys may not
exist for you tomorrow

167
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:42,748
We'll face whatever
the consequences

168
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,754
So come!

169
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,751
Wow! That was fun.

170
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,754
What do you say Kumar Bahadur?

171
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,760
Kumar Bahadur has left.

172
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,138
Neither did he drink,
nor look at that girl.

173
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:44,142
- He's eccentric.
- Call him crazy.

174
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:50,148
Chhotu, don't ever get married.

175
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,777
Yes.
But my mom says l must.

176
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:58,156
Lair! You yourself
want to get married.

177
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:02,160
No master, l swear.
But mom doesn't agree.

178
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:06,790
- Have you seen a girl?
- Mom has.

179
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,793
You yourself are so young,
how old is the girl?

180
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,171
- Five years.
- Five years?

181
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,173
- You are a criminal.
- Yes.

182
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,799
You should be shot dead.

183
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,384
Yes....what?!

184
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,189
Master, here.
Shoot me dead.

185
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,820
- We are ready, sir.
- Arranged the beaters?

186
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:38,822
- Everything has been arranged.
- And those other hunters?

187
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:42,201
l checked on them. After the late
night, they are still sleeping.

188
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:19,756
A palanquin in such
a thick jungle?

189
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,764
Hira, you go and call out
from there, l am going here.

190
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,781
Walk faster.

191
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:49,203
- Stop! Who is that?
- Your father!

192
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,168
Open the door.

193
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,186
- Who is that?
- lt's Chhotu calling.

194
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,188
Call him.

195
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:04,736
- Chhotu, master is here.
- l'm coming.

196
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,156
l heard the gunshots
and came running, master.

197
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,743
She seems to be unconscious.
Splash some water on her.

198
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,186
Hira Singh, look for
the palanquin bearers.

199
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:55,787
Palanquin bearers, if you care
for your lives,present yourselves.

200
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,414
Or l will shoot you dead.

201
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,125
Don't shoot!
We are hiding here.

202
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:05,756
- Come out!
- We don't know anything, sir.

203
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,132
Come and stand here!

204
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,760
Raise your hands.

205
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:11,762
Move!

206
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,775
- Stop!
- Who are you people?

207
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,151
We are palanquin bearers.

208
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,153
- Where do you live?
- Rahimpur bazaar, sir.

209
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,156
- Who is this girl?
- We don't know anything, sir.

210
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,950
Bandits forced us to
carry the palanquin.

211
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,785
- So they were bandits?
- Yes, sir.

212
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,163
Hira, go and make enquiries
in Rahimpur bazaar.

213
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,168
Put your hands your down.
....Carry the palanquin.

214
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,711
- l made enquiries, sir.
- Tell me.

215
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,338
Village Rampur had been looted.

216
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,716
The bandits looted lots of
money & jewelry from 3-4 houses.

217
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,761
And picked up the farmer,
Gokul's widowed wife.

218
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:20,140
-Anyone else in that family?
-Gokul's mother & younger brother.

219
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,728
- Ask the brother to come here.
- He'll be here by evening.

220
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,149
So what the palanquin
bearers said was true.

221
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,359
Yes.

222
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:34,154
Alright, you go and take rest.

223
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,746
- Hira Singh.
- Yes, sir?

224
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,751
Escort this woman
back home tomorrow.

225
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,734
Put the palanquin down.

226
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,159
Where are you going?

227
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:22,744
Sister-in-law is going
inside the house, mother.

228
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:26,123
lnside the house?
Sister-in-law, indeed!

229
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,750
Look, if you want to live,
go and live in the cowshed.

230
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:32,171
You lost your honour and are
returning home after so many days.

231
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,756
What did you expect?
A warm welcome?

232
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,758
She is untouched and safe.

233
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,179
The bandits got scared,
left her and ran away.

234
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:46,185
Shut-up! My son is dead, or
we'd know how untouched she is.

235
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:47,769
The unchaste woman!

236
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,147
Mother, there is no
reason to doubt.

237
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,774
She is untouched,
master said so.

238
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:56,153
You believe
Kumar Bahadur's word?

239
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:01,700
He is King Anand Shanker's
son!

240
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:05,120
And you know
the family reputation.

241
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:09,708
You seem to know everything.

242
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,128
Had the king summoned
you too in his palace?

243
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:17,132
You shameless fellow!
How dare you!

244
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,719
- Who is this bearded man?
- Ask me.

245
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,721
l am Kumar Bahadur's attendant.

246
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,140
Master has said you have
to keep her home in comfort.

247
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,726
Get lost!
Who is he to order me?

248
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,728
- What did you say?
- Don't get annoyed, sir.

249
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,147
Everything will be alright.
Good day.

250
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,733
Sister-in-law,
go inside the house.

251
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,736
Tell master
everything is alright.

252
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,748
Then the old mother-in-law saw
Hira Singh's gun and got scared.

253
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,166
Then we left.

254
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,171
- And Gokul's wife?
- She was crying.

255
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:11,186
Chhotu, ask Khan
to come and see me.

256
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:19,778
- Get whiskey.
- What, master?

257
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:26,201
Tell Haricharan to get whiskey.

258
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:48,807
Hari uncle....

259
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:52,227
What do you want at
this hour, Chhotu?

260
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:57,816
Master has asked for whiskey.

261
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:02,154
- What did you say?
- Master has asked for whiskey.

262
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:07,159
Have you started drinking
at such a young age?

263
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,787
Has Kumar Bahadur
ever touched liquor?

264
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:13,790
Shameless fellow!
Liar!

265
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,167
Go and do your work.

266
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,171
l am not lying,
and l am not drunk either.

267
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:25,177
l asked twice. Master asked me
to tell you to bring him whiskey.

268
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,179
l am going to call Mr.Khan.

269
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,193
Take it to my room.

270
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:49,201
Her thoughts came ...

271
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:54,206
... and just wouldn't stop

272
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:15,769
They went on
making me go crazy

273
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:36,790
Every breath l take,
is someone's memory

274
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:58,228
lt went on making
me more and more restless

275
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:01,773
Her thoughts...

276
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,153
Mr.Khan, you continue.

277
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:15,746
My heart reverberates ...

278
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:20,751
... a lover's voice

279
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:41,772
My heart was lonely,
she filled it with love

280
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,776
Her thoughts...

281
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:59,206
My senses...

282
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:03,168
... were electrified

283
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:24,189
She intoxicated me with her
mischievous eyes and left

284
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:30,779
Her thoughts...

285
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,727
You impudent witch!

286
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:04,730
Had your father sent this
rice that you are thrown it away?

287
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:09,735
Look what she is saying!
You will have to eat this!

288
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:12,738
l'll skin you alive!
How dare you argue with mother!

289
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,748
Break her bones.
Beat her more.

290
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,168
You want to kill me?
Then kill me!

291
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:33,759
Help!
Bandits have entered the village!

292
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,763
Bandits have entered the village!
Come quickly!

293
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:41,183
Over there.

294
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:51,777
Where are you running away?
My son!

295
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:10,754
She is more shocked than hurt.

296
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,756
l have given her
an injection, ...

297
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,758
... but a constant watch
needs to be kept on her.

298
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,761
lf there is any complication,
call me.

299
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:21,139
l will send the medicines across.

300
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:22,766
Good day.

301
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:26,770
Mother.

302
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:23,160
Her mother-in-law and
brother-in-law were very greedy.

303
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,746
They took money
and left the village.

304
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:30,167
- Are you speaking the truth?
- l heard it myself.

305
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:33,170
They took Rs.2000
and left the village.

306
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:37,758
That was good.
Her mother-in-law was a bitch.

307
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,178
But why were they
paid so much money?

308
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:46,767
Rs.2000 is not a
big amount for master.

309
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:51,188
Kumar Bahadur is leaving
for Barrackpur this month.

310
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:52,773
He is taking me along.

311
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,775
What about this woman?

312
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:59,196
Diwanji was saying she'll be sent
to Kashi when she gets better.

313
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:03,742
l'll get you married to Myna &
leave with her on the pilgrimage.

314
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:11,708
No, master said that if l marry
such a young girl, he'll kill me.

315
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,126
l don't want to marry.

316
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,131
Send me away to Kashi?
No.

317
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,818
You give me goblets of wine

318
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,821
And fill my heart with bliss

319
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:50,826
Who will give me this bliss
in the other world

320
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:54,830
Here, l have wine,
l have you

321
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:58,250
Who knows what is over there

322
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:18,770
Angel!

323
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:28,197
Such a beautiful angel.

324
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:36,205
Do you know, mother had
made that jewelry for my wife.

325
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:40,792
But no one is going to
come in this mansion ...

326
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:44,213
... who will wear them
and do justice to our prestige.

327
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,799
l will never get married.

328
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,801
Come.

329
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,161
Yet, you have full
right over this jewelry.

330
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:32,803
From now on,
l'll call you Madhuri.

331
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,805
Madhuri, the one who
charms the heart.

332
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:38,183
Yes Madhuri, l will make
you the way l want you to be.

333
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:42,813
Saudamini is dead forever.

334
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:48,193
And Madhuri begins a new life.

335
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:56,201
Here, my beloved,
l have you, l have wine'

336
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:58,829
There, who knows...'

337
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,745
Madhuri, wait.

338
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:36,176
What kind of behavior is this?
Why did you come away from there?

339
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:41,765
l had bathed, prayed,
and you brought me to a grave.

340
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:45,769
This is not a grave.
lt is the dargah of Salim Chisti.

341
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:46,979
He was a great saint.

342
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,772
What have l got to do that?

343
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,775
l cannot defile my
religion for your sake.

344
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,777
l'll have to go home
and take a bath again.

345
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:56,196
Madhuri, wait!

346
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,171
- Such a huge mansion!
- lt is not a mansion.

347
00:45:12,754 --> 00:45:15,757
lt is Sikandara,
Emperor Akbar's tomb.

348
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:21,138
A grave here too? Why have you
brought me to a city of graves?

349
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,348
Take me back to Vrindavan.

350
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:26,185
l'll bathe in the pond
there and be purified again.

351
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:44,203
- What are you doing?
- l was thinking.

352
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:46,205
- With closed eyes?
- Yes.

353
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:49,208
- Lair! You are lying.
- Yes....no!

354
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,793
l say, you were sleeping,
not thinking.

355
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:54,171
l really was thinking, madam.

356
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:57,007
lf you have to think, think
with your head, not your nose.

357
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:58,175
Lair!

358
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:04,723
Got caught!

359
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:14,149
What are you doing here?
Don't you have any work?

360
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,735
l had come to tell Shibu
to grind almonds.

361
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,737
So what are you doing here?

362
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:22,157
l came to tell Mishraji that
master wants his dinner on time.

363
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:25,744
Mishraji, hurry up, it's time
for Kumar Bahadur to arrive.

364
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:32,167
You do the chores so slowly.

365
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:33,752
l am almost through, madam.

366
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:36,171
Where is my box of paan'?

367
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:37,756
l'll give it to you.

368
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:49,768
Coming!

369
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:55,774
You're back.
What have you bought for me?

370
00:46:56,191 --> 00:47:00,737
- Saree blouse?
- Open and see what it contains.

371
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:08,120
What lovely pictures!

372
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:10,122
Where did you
get these books from?

373
00:47:11,123 --> 00:47:16,128
Elephant, cat, horse, monkey.

374
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:20,132
- Like it?
- Very much.

375
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,758
You will have to
read all those books.

376
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:25,137
Yes!

377
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:27,764
What is this?

378
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:31,768
Come on.

379
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:35,772
- lt's A'.
- lt's your head.

380
00:47:36,148 --> 00:47:39,776
This is not A',
it's D'. This is A'.

381
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,779
Not English, teach me Hindi.

382
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:47,784
Come on, now you read.

383
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:53,165
You don't love me.

384
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,794
l love you very much, Madhuri.

385
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:08,138
- O' for owl.
- O' for owl.

386
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:10,140
The owl speaks.

387
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:17,147
- R' for rabbit.
- R' for rabbit.

388
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:21,735
- The rabbit runs.
- The rabbit runs.

389
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:28,742
- F' for food.
- F' for food.

390
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:32,746
- The food is cooked.
- The food is cooked.

391
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:35,165
The food must be ready.

392
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:37,167
- l'll go and check.
- Sit down and study.

393
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,170
lt's tame for your dinner
and l am still sitting here.

394
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:44,758
- Not tame, time.
- But Chhotu says tame.

395
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,177
Chhotu is a servant, illiterate.
You are the lady of the house.

396
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:54,184
Alright, time. Let me go, it
is so late, and l'm hungry too.

397
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:00,107
- What?
- Read again.

398
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:05,112
- Read?
- Yes, read again.

399
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,740
When your pronunciation is
wrong, what will you teach me?

400
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,117
Alright.

401
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,129
That is what l said.

402
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:28,719
No madam, read like l do.

403
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:33,140
Not sily, sly.

404
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,730
- What is God?
- God means, Bhugwan.

405
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:43,734
Bhugwan?
No, it's Bhagwan.

406
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,736
Alright, Bhugwan.

407
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:04,755
God, l'm scared!

408
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:11,780
Rohini is no good.
l don't like her.

409
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:14,783
- Who?
- Rohini.

410
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,160
The lady of
Kishankant's Bill.

411
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:19,788
lt's not Kishankant,
it's Krishnakant.

412
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:23,166
And not Bill, it's Will.

413
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:29,214
Alright. And that Gobindlal
has left his wife, Bhimar ...

414
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,216
... and got involved
with that witch.

415
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,802
lt's not Gobindlal,
it's Govindlal.

416
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:36,805
And it's not Bhimar,
it's Bhramar.

417
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:39,808
Alright,
but atleast let me finish.

418
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:43,228
And even that bitch met
the same fate.

419
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:47,816
Gobindlal killed her.
She deserved it, the bitch!

420
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,238
What happened?
Where are you going?

421
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,746
Not like that,
sing like this.

422
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:13,175
l cannot sing.

423
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:24,770
l cannot learn to sing.

424
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:30,192
Then what can you do? Sleep and
munch paan' all day like a cow?

425
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:36,782
- You are angry.
- No, l am not angry.

426
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,785
Come, l'll sit with you.

427
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,138
Enough! Stop it!

428
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,210
- Who is it?
- lt's me master, Chhotu.

429
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,294
l just came.

430
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:58,799
Go and greet him. Go.

431
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:01,718
Don't feel shy,
master is like our father.

432
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:02,928
Greet him.

433
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:11,728
- Who is she?
- She's Myna.

434
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:15,148
- Myna?
- My wife.

435
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:19,152
But you said
she is five years old.

436
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:26,159
That was ten years ago. She was
five years old, ten years ago.

437
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:27,744
Ten years.

438
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:38,755
Ten years!

439
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:49,766
Ten years.

440
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:57,774
Ten...years.

441
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:07,743
Ten years...Ten years!
...Ten years!

442
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:54,206
On the melody of
lonely breaths

443
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:59,211
On the wet
strings of tears

444
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:13,725
Life is hearing a song

445
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:19,731
Life is singing a song

446
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:51,763
What is called love

447
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:02,733
ls a game, is a toy

448
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:07,112
You get it today,
you lose it tomorrow

449
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:18,749
On lonely...

450
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:25,756
On the melody of lonely breaths

451
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:30,761
On the wet strings of tears

452
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:35,766
Life is joining in a note

453
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:40,145
Life is forgetting a note

454
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:45,150
On the melody...

455
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:21,728
Some buds sing

456
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,152
Some buds cry

457
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:33,740
Some tears are just water,
some tears are pearls

458
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,171
On the melody
of lonely breaths

459
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:52,176
On the wet strings of tears

460
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:57,181
Life is making someone laugh

461
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:01,768
Life is making someone cry

462
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,815
- What's there to laugh in this?
- What else can l do?

463
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:51,818
You should have
atleast seen your face.

464
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:53,820
What's wrong with my face?

465
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:58,242
Your hair is greying.
Have you noticed?

466
01:00:58,825 --> 01:00:59,826
l know.

467
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:04,748
But why this sudden
desire to get married?

468
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:07,751
And just the desire won't
help you get married.

469
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:09,962
Who will give you a girl?

470
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,172
And which girl will
agree to marry you?

471
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,759
ls that so?

472
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,178
But you don't have
any objection, do you?

473
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:21,181
Not at all.

474
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:22,766
But tell me something.

475
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,769
Why did you suddenly think of
getting married at this age?

476
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:30,190
Who doesn't want a normal life?

477
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:35,779
Besides, l also have some
duty towards my family.

478
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:43,203
l gathered information, master.
The girl's name is Sumita.

479
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,791
- Who is in her family.
- A mother and father.

480
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:52,796
Mother and father.

481
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:02,181
lt's morning and Sumita hasn't
returned from the function yet.

482
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,766
God knows what
this girl is up to.

483
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:26,205
Listen. Get up and
make me a cup of tea.

484
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:29,208
My temperature
hasn't subsided yet.

485
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,793
- Not yet?
- No.

486
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:34,796
You are sick all
365 days in a year.

487
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:36,798
How do l go out
without having tea?

488
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:38,800
We are out of tea leaves.

489
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:43,805
- No tea leaves?
- Yes.

490
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:50,229
Why are there no tea leaves?
You squander away my money.

491
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:54,816
Squander money?
As if you make millions.

492
01:02:55,234 --> 01:03:00,155
Whatever little you make, you
blow away on liquor and races.

493
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:01,365
l'll spend as l wish!

494
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:06,745
Do you know, last week's reward
has got carried over this week.

495
01:03:07,162 --> 01:03:10,749
You understand?...You
will, only if you have brains.

496
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,169
This week,
the reward will be Rs.60000.

497
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:19,758
And when l bring that
Rs.60000 home ...

498
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:23,178
... it will surprise you.

499
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:27,182
That's what l have been
hearing all my life.

500
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:30,185
How can l be lucky when
l have a wife like you?

501
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:33,772
Damn!
You ruined my morning.

502
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:41,196
And don't you dare spend a penny
from the money Sumita brings.

503
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,783
Or we'll have a war at home.

504
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,766
You're back.
Where were you for so long?

505
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:13,145
The function went on until late,
so l stayed over at Ratna's.

506
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:15,772
You did the right thing.
Give me the money.

507
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:19,776
Here's Rs.50.

508
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:23,155
But they promised to pay
Rs.100. So why Rs.50 only?

509
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,782
They said they will
give the balance later.

510
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:30,162
They said they will pay later?
Trying to fool me?

511
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:52,809
Here's Rs.10.
Buy a packet of tea leaves.

512
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:58,190
And buy vegetables and
anything else you want to.

513
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:00,734
l will not come for lunch.

514
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:07,741
And tell those people if they
don't pay the balance money ...

515
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:09,159
... l sue them.

516
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,745
Move!

517
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:36,770
Listen.....l am calling you.

518
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:41,191
- Me?
- Yes.

519
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:49,199
Me? Mr.Aga,
don't you sleep at night?

520
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:51,785
- You want interest early
in the morning? - What?

521
01:05:52,786 --> 01:06:00,711
l mean that l owe you
interest amount of Rs.12.50.

522
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:02,337
l can pay you the interest.

523
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:05,132
But last week's reward of
Rs.25000 ...

524
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:09,136
... got carried forward this
week, and has become Rs.60000.

525
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:10,721
Today is Saturday.

526
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:14,725
l will play today and return
your every penny tomorrow.

527
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:21,732
But this is not done.
l am going to play the races ...

528
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:24,151
... and you have come to
collect your money early morning.

529
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,779
What are you talking about?
l don't understand.

530
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:30,157
- l am not Aga.
- You are not Aga?

531
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:35,162
No, my name is Hira Singh.
Are you Sumita's father?

532
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:38,749
Why didn't you tell me before?

533
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,169
No, actually, l am...

534
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:50,761
- Then let's go.
- Where?

535
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:53,180
My master has sent his greetings.

536
01:06:53,305 --> 01:06:56,767
l don't know your master.
Why has he sent me greetings?

537
01:06:57,184 --> 01:07:01,146
My master is Kumar Bahadur
Gyanshanker Rai of Rainagar.

538
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:08,737
Alright, let's go.
No, wait.

539
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:15,118
Does your master play races? Then
ask him to bet on Star of ltaly.

540
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:16,745
l'm giving him a tip.

541
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:22,125
He doesn't want any tips.
He has urgent work with you.

542
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:23,252
Urgent work?

543
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,132
Here mother, take your medicine.

544
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:33,762
This sickness is
going to take my life.

545
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:35,138
Don't talk like that.

546
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:46,775
l am only worried about your
marriage now.

547
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:48,777
Then l'll die peacefully.

548
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:53,782
Don't worry, mother.
What is destined will happen.

549
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:58,787
- Here's Rs.50.
- How did you save so much?

550
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:01,707
l told father
l'll get Rs.50 later.

551
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:03,709
What if he comes to know?

552
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,128
We'll deal with it then.

553
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:23,145
- How are you feeling now, Manju?
- Come, sister.

554
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:27,149
- The temperature is still high.
- l've sent for the doctor.

555
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:29,735
Vishnu is bringing
milk and porridge for you.

556
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:31,737
What has Shekhar written?

557
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:35,741
London, dated 22nd.
Aunt, greetings.

558
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:37,367
- ls it Shekhar's letter?
- Yes, mother.

559
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:39,745
That is why l came. And
she snatched the letter from me.

560
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:41,371
He sends you his
greetings, mother.

561
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:44,166
God bless him.
When is he coming?

562
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:48,754
He's written he'll go to buy his
ticket after posting this letter.

563
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:52,174
Alright, leave us alone,
l want to talk to your mother.

564
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:59,765
Shekhar is coming in a few days.

565
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:03,101
So l thought l'll
discuss this with you.

566
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:04,728
Tell me.

567
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:09,107
l want to make Sumita my
daughter-in-law.

568
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:13,111
-What do you think?
-Sumita likes you since childhood.

569
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,321
Even now, she is all yours.

570
01:09:50,148 --> 01:09:52,776
You will get the balance money
on the day of the marriage.

571
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:54,778
Alright.

572
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:10,169
No one should know
the date of the marriage.

573
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:15,799
lt is the 14th today.

574
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,177
All arrangements
within seven days...

575
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:20,179
That's my responsibility,
you don't worry about it.

576
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:24,183
You won't have to
spend a single penny.

577
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:26,185
A house will be
taken in Balliganj, ...

578
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:27,936
... and the marriage
will be conducted there.

579
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:32,482
And yes, your daughter will not
come to meet you very often ...

580
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:33,817
.. after marriage.

581
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:35,194
Okay.

582
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:40,824
l have heard
you are fond of races.

583
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:43,827
What are you saying!
l am a poor man.

584
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:50,209
l survive on my pension
and some rent l get.

585
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:55,839
How can l play races?
But if you...

586
01:10:55,964 --> 01:10:59,218
Hira Singh, drop him home.

587
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:02,179
- Good day.
- Come, sir.

588
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,765
This marriage will
never take place!

589
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:08,769
- lt will!
- l won't allow it!

590
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:14,191
Shut-up! Do you know how
much money he has given me?

591
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:16,777
l will never sell
my daughter for money.

592
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:20,197
Shut-up!
Don't give me that big talk.

593
01:11:20,197 --> 01:11:23,784
l am the master of the house.
l will decide!

594
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:28,789
Master indeed!
l lost all my children.

595
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:33,794
You could neither feed them,
nor afford their treatment.

596
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:38,215
We just have one daughter left.
You cannot feed even her.

597
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:41,802
She did her 12th grade
with great difficulty.

598
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:43,804
She could not
continue with her education.

599
01:11:44,805 --> 01:11:46,807
Thanks to Shekhar
that she learnt to sing.

600
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:48,809
She sings and makes a living.

601
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:51,228
You blow away her money
too in liquor and races.

602
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:54,815
You have even mortgaged the
house,& then you act high handed?

603
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:56,024
Don't you feel ashamed?

604
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:59,820
- Why should l feel ashamed?
- Mother!

605
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,739
Mother, be quiet.

606
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:05,158
l will not stay quiet.
l have kept quiet all my life.

607
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:10,747
Shut-up, woman! l have mortgaged
my house. Why do you complain?

608
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:13,166
Enough now, don't shout.

609
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,170
You bitch!

610
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:18,172
Shut-up, you lowly man.

611
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,175
l will never allow my daughter's
marriage with an old man.

612
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:22,801
You called me a lowly man?

613
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:27,806
Yes, you are a lowly man! A
drunkard, gambler, selfish fiend!

614
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:29,766
What did you say!

615
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:52,789
My bottle also broke. Where will
l get scotch now at this hour?

616
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:58,212
Father, don't go,
l'll get married.

617
01:12:58,837 --> 01:13:00,172
l will get married, father.

618
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:56,228
Nice doll.

619
01:14:31,763 --> 01:14:34,183
You really have brought
home a beautiful doll.

620
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:38,770
l have married her.

621
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:42,774
Yes, you had brought home
a doll ten years ago too.

622
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:45,194
But you didn't marry her.

623
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:48,197
And didn't keep her in your
mother's mansion either.

624
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:12,763
Tell me,
is she more beautiful than me?

625
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:18,143
l did not marry
her for her looks.

626
01:15:18,769 --> 01:15:22,147
Oh, you saw her qualities.

627
01:15:22,773 --> 01:15:27,152
That's true. She is educated,
and can even sing.

628
01:15:27,778 --> 01:15:30,155
l don't have any qualities.

629
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:32,783
- But...
- But what?

630
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:35,786
Let me see how long this game
will last with that doll.

631
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:39,790
Madhuri! Sumita is my wife.
So...

632
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:43,168
So you will have to spend
your nuptial night with her.

633
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:46,797
- But...
- But what?

634
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:50,175
- l was thinking...
- What were you thinking?

635
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:56,181
About the huge age
difference between you two.

636
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:57,808
Just think about it.

637
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:34,178
- Sumita, are you sad?
- About what?

638
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:37,181
About your marriage with me?

639
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:41,768
- Why do you say that?
- Because...

640
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:45,772
... l am too old for you.

641
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,775
l never thought about that.

642
01:16:51,778 --> 01:16:55,199
Sumita,
this is my mother's mansion.

643
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:00,120
After her death,
this mansion had been shut.

644
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:07,711
The mansion was opened for you
after so many years.

645
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,720
You have done your
12th grade, right?

646
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:20,724
- Yes.
- Why didn't you continue?

647
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:24,144
You are aware of
our financial state.

648
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:31,735
- Want to study further?
- lf you wish so.

649
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:36,740
Sumita, will you sing for me?

650
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:40,160
lf you want to hear me sing,
l surely will.

651
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:43,747
Then come.

652
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:06,728
Bedeck my bed
with flowers today

653
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:16,154
l will be born again today

654
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:25,747
The dot is made of moon,
my bangles are made of stars

655
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:34,131
My necklace made of dreams

656
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:42,764
My breaths is
fragrant with saffron

657
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:50,189
My body desirous

658
01:18:52,191 --> 01:19:00,115
Adorn me so, my friend

659
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:09,708
That my husband loses control

660
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:20,719
Bedeck my bed...

661
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:04,781
Don't cry, mother.

662
01:21:05,157 --> 01:21:08,160
l am telling you the truth,
l am very happy.

663
01:21:08,785 --> 01:21:11,788
Don't console me,
l know everything.

664
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:17,794
You don't know. Do you know
what a huge mansion he has?

665
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:24,176
Tall pillars, big rooms,
servants, property!

666
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:29,181
Do you know what his yearly
income is? Rs.10,00000!

667
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:35,187
lf it was you, you would have
got lost in that mansion.

668
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:37,981
l don't get out of
my room out of fear.

669
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:42,194
Diwan uncle was saying that
now since he is married ...

670
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:44,821
...Kumar Bahadur will be bestowed
the title of Raja Bahadur(king).

671
01:21:45,197 --> 01:21:48,200
And l'll be Rani Maa
(queen mother).

672
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:52,204
l'll become the
Queen of Rainagar!

673
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:55,832
Shekhar has returned from abroad.

674
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:03,757
So he is back?

675
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:07,761
After three years instead of two.

676
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:12,766
As a qualified engineer
with a degree.

677
01:22:13,183 --> 01:22:16,770
- Won't you go to meet him?
- l surely will.

678
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:24,778
l will hear about him and tell
him about my good fortune.

679
01:22:25,195 --> 01:22:27,781
- l must go.
- Then go right now.

680
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:28,907
Yes.

681
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:43,213
- Going out?
- l'm going to meet Shekhar.

682
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:45,215
- But...
- lf you don't...

683
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:48,218
No, l just wanted to
say that don't be too long.

684
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:50,220
Return soon.

685
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:53,223
Because Kumar Bahadur
can come any time.

686
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:56,018
He said he will come
in the evening, but ...

687
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:57,811
l'll be back soon, father.

688
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:01,732
Alright.

689
01:24:06,755 --> 01:24:10,175
- Shekhar...
- Go back home, Sumita.

690
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:13,136
Did you meet mother
after you returned?

691
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:15,180
l didn't think it necessary.

692
01:24:15,347 --> 01:24:20,185
lf you had, perhaps you wouldn't
have torn my pictures like this.

693
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:21,770
What do you mean?

694
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:25,774
There was liquor in the bottle,
so the wound has healed.

695
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:31,196
What are you talking?
Liquor in the bottle?

696
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,198
What are you talking about?

697
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:36,785
The scar on mother's
head will never fade.

698
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:40,163
- Don't blabber like mad.
- l wish l was mad.

699
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:42,791
Atleast my mother wouldn't
have got beaten then.

700
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:46,170
Who hit her? Your father?
With a bottle of liquor?

701
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:54,803
Forgive me, Sumita. l never
expected him to stoop so low.

702
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:58,807
- Sumita.
- Aunt!

703
01:25:06,148 --> 01:25:07,149
Don't cry.

704
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:31,757
Sit here,
l'll get something for you.

705
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:44,186
Shekhar, my mother is very
unhappy, and alone.

706
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:46,188
Please take care of her.

707
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:50,192
Sure l will.
You don't worry about her.

708
01:25:52,778 --> 01:25:58,784
Look Sumita,
no one can change destiny.

709
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:05,123
Now your only goal should be
to keep your husband happy.

710
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:08,752
You bless me.

711
01:26:10,128 --> 01:26:16,134
l bless that you live
a happy married life.

712
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:20,764
But l cannot understand him.

713
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:24,768
lt takes time to
understand any man.

714
01:26:25,143 --> 01:26:28,772
Shekhar is a very nice boy.
They are childhood friends.

715
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:32,776
Shekhar's aunt used to carry
Sumita in her arms all day.

716
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:37,155
lt is Shekhar who encouraged
Sumita to study and sing.

717
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:39,157
l just left her there
and came back.

718
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:43,161
Shekhar has returned from Germany
as an engineer after many years.

719
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:46,790
l was there with here. Now
that you are waiting for her...

720
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:49,793
- ... l'll go and call her.
- l'll come with you.

721
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:52,796
- What was his name you said?
- Shekhar. He's a very nice boy.

722
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:56,800
- Where does he live?
- Close by.

723
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,759
We'll walk it out.

724
01:27:05,142 --> 01:27:06,727
Go Vishnu, get tea.

725
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:10,147
Have some snacks, Sumita.

726
01:27:15,736 --> 01:27:17,738
Sumita, come soon,
Kumar Bahadur has come.

727
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:19,740
He has? But he said
he will come in the evening.

728
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:22,159
Can't trust these rich men.
He came just now.

729
01:27:22,743 --> 01:27:24,161
Shekhar, you also come.
He is sitting in the hall.

730
01:27:24,369 --> 01:27:25,329
Come.

731
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:45,182
Shekhar, he is my son-in-law,
Kumar Gyanshanker Rai.

732
01:27:45,766 --> 01:27:47,184
He's Shekhar, a very nice boy.

733
01:27:48,185 --> 01:27:51,188
l heard you used to
teach music to Sumita?

734
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:54,191
Oh, it was nothing.
Please sit down.

735
01:27:54,775 --> 01:27:58,779
Don't be humble. l was
impressed by Sumita's singing.

736
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:04,117
Why just singing? Shekhar may
be an engineer, but look.

737
01:28:04,743 --> 01:28:08,121
He has sculpted those statues.
And those two paintings...

738
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:13,126
Yes, he has painted them.

739
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:19,716
Beautiful.
You are Michaelangelo.

740
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,138
But l never heard that
he could even sing.

741
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:26,723
Don't joke, Kumar Bahadur.

742
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:31,144
l am not joking, though
our relationship is a joke.

743
01:28:32,771 --> 01:28:34,147
Relationship a joke?

744
01:28:35,774 --> 01:28:41,154
You go home. l will spend some
time with Shekhar, and leave.

745
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,740
As you wish.

746
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:52,749
- Sumi, bless you, dear.
- Father.

747
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:58,755
Do write.

748
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:04,720
Do write.
Good bye.

749
01:29:10,142 --> 01:29:12,728
So tell me, when are
you coming to our house?

750
01:29:13,145 --> 01:29:15,105
We'll chat later, first
let's have some refreshments.

751
01:29:15,731 --> 01:29:17,733
Please, cut out the formalities.

752
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:20,110
Come over in a day or two.

753
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:23,739
lf you don't, l'll
come and take you by force.

754
01:29:43,759 --> 01:29:47,179
- Want to say something?
- Madam is waiting for you.

755
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:52,768
Escort Sumita to her room.

756
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:10,202
You called for me?

757
01:30:10,786 --> 01:30:12,204
When you don't come on your own,
l have to summon you.

758
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:17,209
You have just forgotten
the way to my room.

759
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:22,798
Should l not fulfill
my duty towards Sumita?

760
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:25,801
What about your duty towards me?

761
01:30:26,218 --> 01:30:28,178
You are the lady of the house.

762
01:30:28,804 --> 01:30:32,224
Madam, queen,
all the keys are with you.

763
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:35,227
Madam? Queen?
Nonsense!

764
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:39,231
Keep your keys with you,
or give them to Sumita.

765
01:30:40,816 --> 01:30:47,823
l want you, or return the
life l lived 10 years ago.

766
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:55,831
l don't know about myself, but
the clock cannot be turned back.

767
01:30:56,832 --> 01:31:00,752
For you, me or anybody else.

768
01:31:11,763 --> 01:31:16,185
A mirror once broken,
cannot be joined back.

769
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:19,188
lt has to be changed.

770
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:55,724
l sing songs

771
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:01,730
l hum away

772
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:06,151
l had made a
promise to laugh always

773
01:32:06,777 --> 01:32:10,155
That is why l am always smiling

774
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:45,148
These moments of
love are so precious

775
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:49,736
My words are
softer than flowers

776
01:33:02,749 --> 01:33:06,170
l shower everyone
with these soft flowers

777
01:33:06,753 --> 01:33:08,755
l am always smiling

778
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:59,139
Who knew there would
be so much happiness

779
01:33:59,765 --> 01:34:03,727
My heart is blooming with joy

780
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:20,160
My heart is clean

781
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:22,746
l am always smiling

782
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,127
You are joking
once again, Kumar Bahadur.

783
01:35:11,753 --> 01:35:15,132
Shekhar,
it is good to be humble ...

784
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:18,760
... but not
beyond a certain limit.

785
01:35:20,762 --> 01:35:26,768
She is my mother. Very
different from the Rai family.

786
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:31,773
l had molded myself
to my mother's ideals.

787
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:37,154
But since the last 7-8 years,
l began to behave ...

788
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:39,156
... like the blood thirsty Rais'.

789
01:35:39,781 --> 01:35:41,700
Look, you'll see signs of
killing all around.

790
01:35:43,702 --> 01:35:46,705
Before leaving for Germany,
even l liked to hunt.

791
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:50,125
l have a gun too.
Will you take me along?

792
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:56,131
But l have promised to quit
both, liquor, and hunting.

793
01:35:56,715 --> 01:35:59,134
l will once again follow
my mother's ideals.

794
01:35:59,718 --> 01:36:02,137
Thus, l will begin life afresh.

795
01:36:02,721 --> 01:36:05,724
Will you help me?

796
01:36:05,933 --> 01:36:08,727
Sure, l will.
Tell me what l have to do.

797
01:36:09,144 --> 01:36:13,148
You take care of Sumita.

798
01:36:13,732 --> 01:36:18,153
So that your laughter,
your music ...

799
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:23,158
.. breaths fresh life into
this lifeless Rai mansion.

800
01:36:25,744 --> 01:36:28,747
Help me.

801
01:36:29,748 --> 01:36:31,750
l didn't know
you were so emotional.

802
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:36,755
You didn't answer me.

803
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:41,718
lf that is what pleases you,
l promise you.

804
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:43,095
Thank you.

805
01:36:50,102 --> 01:36:53,689
- Shekhar is a talented boy.
- Yes, very talented.

806
01:36:54,731 --> 01:37:02,114
He is not only an engineer,
he even sculpts, paints, sings.

807
01:37:02,739 --> 01:37:06,702
- He's even handsome.
- Yes, he looks good.

808
01:37:07,744 --> 01:37:09,121
Shekhar and Sumita's pair...

809
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:16,712
What do you mean?

810
01:37:17,129 --> 01:37:20,716
Have you given a thought to the
fact that they grew up together.

811
01:37:20,883 --> 01:37:23,135
They could have been in
love with each other.

812
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,140
Even their marriage
could have been a possibility.

813
01:37:30,142 --> 01:37:33,145
What is this?
You are leaving your meal...

814
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:34,730
Listen!

815
01:37:40,694 --> 01:37:42,112
Sumita, is it true ...

816
01:37:42,279 --> 01:37:46,700
... that there were talks of
your marriage with Shekhar?

817
01:37:46,909 --> 01:37:50,120
My mother and his aunt wanted it.

818
01:37:50,704 --> 01:37:51,705
And you?

819
01:37:56,710 --> 01:38:00,130
You didn't answer me.
What did you want?

820
01:38:01,131 --> 01:38:05,719
Parent's wishes are important
in such matters.

821
01:38:06,136 --> 01:38:09,723
Oh. So it can be said ...

822
01:38:09,932 --> 01:38:13,143
... that you
didn't desire to marry me.

823
01:38:13,727 --> 01:38:15,729
No, l didn't say that.

824
01:38:46,677 --> 01:38:47,678
- Hello.
- Hello.

825
01:38:47,845 --> 01:38:48,804
Sit down.

826
01:38:51,682 --> 01:38:53,100
Please be seated.

827
01:38:55,686 --> 01:38:57,688
Tell me, what can l do for you?

828
01:38:58,105 --> 01:39:02,109
l came here...
l mean, Kumar Bahadur...

829
01:39:02,693 --> 01:39:05,112
But he suddenly left
for hunting yesterday.

830
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:09,700
Left for hunting?
Then why today...

831
01:39:10,701 --> 01:39:12,119
- You are Shekhar?
- Yes.

832
01:39:12,703 --> 01:39:15,122
- Haricharan.
- Yes, madam.

833
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:17,332
Escort him to Sumita's soon.

834
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:18,709
But...

835
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:24,715
Why? Are you afraid to enter the
mansion in the master's absence?

836
01:39:25,716 --> 01:39:27,718
But Kumar Bahadur
has told me ...

837
01:39:28,135 --> 01:39:29,136
... that whenever you come, ...

838
01:39:29,344 --> 01:39:32,723
... you should be
escorted to Sumita's room.

839
01:39:33,724 --> 01:39:36,727
- You...
- l am Madhuri.

840
01:39:36,935 --> 01:39:39,146
The rest,
you will know later.

841
01:39:39,730 --> 01:39:45,694
Haricharan, ask Myna to
take him to Sumita.

842
01:39:46,695 --> 01:39:49,072
- Come, sir.
- Go.

843
01:39:58,707 --> 01:40:01,084
Tell me, who is this Madhuri?

844
01:40:04,713 --> 01:40:09,092
l don't know,
but everyone calls her madam.

845
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:11,720
Even the house keys are with her.

846
01:40:12,095 --> 01:40:15,098
Nothing happens in this
mansion without her consent.

847
01:40:15,724 --> 01:40:19,728
Even Kumar Bahadur
does everything she says.

848
01:40:20,103 --> 01:40:22,731
Haven't you ever
questioned Kumar Bahadur?

849
01:40:23,732 --> 01:40:29,738
No. lt is forbidden to
know too much in this house.

850
01:40:31,114 --> 01:40:34,743
Kumar Gyanshanker is truly
a strange man.

851
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:40,666
- Shekhar and Sumita's pair ...
- What do you mean?

852
01:40:40,874 --> 01:40:44,086
Have you given a thought to the
fact that they grew up together.

853
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:47,089
They could have been in
love with each other.

854
01:40:47,673 --> 01:40:52,094
Even their marriage
could have been a possibility.

855
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:55,681
Sumita, is it true ...

856
01:40:55,681 --> 01:40:58,684
... that there were talks of
your marriage with Shekhar?

857
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:02,688
My mother and his aunt wanted it.

858
01:41:03,689 --> 01:41:04,690
And you?

859
01:41:05,691 --> 01:41:09,695
Parent's wishes are important
in such matters.

860
01:41:19,705 --> 01:41:23,709
O heart, sing in tune

861
01:41:37,723 --> 01:41:42,144
Don't sing
any note out of tune

862
01:42:12,758 --> 01:42:16,762
Life is a union of
sorrow and happiness

863
01:42:21,767 --> 01:42:25,771
Like high notes with low

864
01:42:30,776 --> 01:42:33,195
Merge the two

865
01:42:39,785 --> 01:42:42,120
O heart, sing in tune

866
01:43:55,736 --> 01:43:57,738
- Master!
- Master!

867
01:43:58,155 --> 01:44:00,741
Master, the
lioness has been located ...

868
01:44:00,949 --> 01:44:03,160
... near the pond
at the foot of the mountain.

869
01:44:05,746 --> 01:44:07,748
Your friend
is very unfair to you.

870
01:44:08,165 --> 01:44:12,753
- My friend?
- Your pupil is your friend.

871
01:44:13,754 --> 01:44:16,757
You return so late
from office.

872
01:44:17,174 --> 01:44:18,342
Then you come here, ...

873
01:44:18,759 --> 01:44:20,761
... and she doesn't even
ask if you'll have something.

874
01:44:21,178 --> 01:44:24,139
l have heard no one does
anything here without your orders.

875
01:44:24,765 --> 01:44:27,184
You've heard that?
Then it's my mistake.

876
01:44:27,768 --> 01:44:29,770
Sit down.
Please sit down.

877
01:44:35,192 --> 01:44:37,778
Please eat....Eat.

878
01:44:40,697 --> 01:44:42,115
Will you teach me to sing?

879
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:44,117
Can you sing?

880
01:44:44,701 --> 01:44:46,703
lf you teach me,
l'll surely learn.

881
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,705
Then l'll surely teach you.

882
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:49,831
Thank you.

883
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:54,711
You two make a lovely pair.

884
01:44:55,712 --> 01:44:57,130
You told me something?

885
01:44:59,716 --> 01:45:03,136
l was thinking that no one
can still be so happy ...

886
01:45:03,345 --> 01:45:06,139
... after giving something that
belongs to him to someone else.

887
01:45:06,723 --> 01:45:08,141
l don't understand.

888
01:45:09,726 --> 01:45:11,144
My misfortune.

889
01:45:14,731 --> 01:45:16,149
You didn't eat anything.

890
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:20,737
l had enough.
Good day.

891
01:45:48,098 --> 01:45:51,101
Kumar Bahadur has come. Get the
ground almond for the sherbet.

892
01:45:51,727 --> 01:45:54,104
Ask Shivnandan to even get
hot water for his bath here.

893
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:57,107
And get his smoking pipe too.
Hurry!

894
01:47:01,713 --> 01:47:03,715
- Chhotu.
- Coming, madam.

895
01:47:15,727 --> 01:47:19,147
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

896
01:47:20,732 --> 01:47:23,151
- How are you?
- l am fine.

897
01:47:24,736 --> 01:47:27,155
But you look pale.

898
01:47:27,739 --> 01:47:30,742
l could not sleep all night
because of a headache.

899
01:47:31,159 --> 01:47:32,160
l'm fine today.

900
01:47:32,744 --> 01:47:35,163
But you look very tired.

901
01:47:37,749 --> 01:47:38,750
Tired?

902
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:40,711
Yes, really.

903
01:47:41,712 --> 01:47:49,678
Sumi, since that first day, l've
not been able to hear you sing.

904
01:47:50,721 --> 01:47:53,098
Will you sing for me some day?

905
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:54,308
Whenever you like.

906
01:47:55,726 --> 01:47:58,103
You know to cook, right?
Some day...

907
01:47:58,729 --> 01:48:00,105
Why some day?
Shall l cook today?

908
01:48:00,731 --> 01:48:05,110
You'll cook today?
Alright.

909
01:48:05,736 --> 01:48:09,114
Chhotu,
remove Kumar Bahadur's shoes.

910
01:48:21,126 --> 01:48:23,712
Keep this on the bed,
he will wear them after his bath.

911
01:48:31,762 --> 01:48:35,140
The water is ready for your bath.
l'll get sherbet for you.

912
01:48:35,265 --> 01:48:36,725
- Shyama.
- Coming, madam.

913
01:48:50,113 --> 01:48:53,700
Alright then, we'll cook,
mutton pulav, fish ...

914
01:48:53,909 --> 01:48:56,703
... pulses, prawns,
chutney, and sweetened milk.

915
01:48:56,912 --> 01:48:58,288
And yes, l will cook all this.

916
01:48:58,705 --> 01:49:01,124
- What!..alright.
- Ask Shibu to grind the spices.

917
01:49:01,708 --> 01:49:04,127
- Do we have all the spices?
- Yes.

918
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:05,921
Keep all this ready,
l'm coming.

919
01:49:06,129 --> 01:49:07,714
- Madam...
- Did you grind almonds?

920
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,133
l did grind them, but Sumita
madam called them to her room.

921
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:12,302
l have asked
Shibu to grind some more.

922
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:14,137
Good.
Bring them quickly.

923
01:49:14,304 --> 01:49:16,139
l'll check if
Kumar Bahadur finished bathing.

924
01:49:21,144 --> 01:49:22,104
Listen...

925
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:50,090
- Madam, ground almonds.
- Take it back, Shyama.

926
01:49:50,674 --> 01:49:54,094
And ask Mishraji
to cook the meal.

927
01:50:01,685 --> 01:50:04,104
Here, drink sherbet.

928
01:50:04,688 --> 01:50:08,108
Sumita is making
almond sherbet for me.

929
01:50:10,694 --> 01:50:15,115
But you always had sherbet
made by me.

930
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:16,700
l didn't have Sumita then.

931
01:50:17,701 --> 01:50:24,124
l know. You brought me
from Rainager to Barrackpur.

932
01:50:25,709 --> 01:50:30,714
And you have coronated
her on the throne of Rainager.

933
01:50:31,715 --> 01:50:34,134
Sumita is the daughter-in-law
of this royal family.

934
01:50:35,719 --> 01:50:37,721
That is where she won.

935
01:50:38,138 --> 01:50:43,060
But l am not ready to
give up my right.

936
01:50:45,687 --> 01:50:49,691
Madhuri, why are you bent
on breaking up Sumita's home?

937
01:50:50,692 --> 01:50:54,071
l am not so magnanimous to break
my own home to make someone else's

938
01:51:04,706 --> 01:51:06,708
The day l killed this lioness ...

939
01:51:06,917 --> 01:51:09,086
That same day,
you saved me from bandits.

940
01:51:09,711 --> 01:51:11,088
And brought me here.

941
01:51:11,713 --> 01:51:16,718
And so that l don't forget this,
you kept this skin here.

942
01:51:17,094 --> 01:51:22,099
To remind me that even l can meet
the same fate as this lioness.

943
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:29,106
Madhuri, release me.

944
01:51:30,107 --> 01:51:31,733
Let me go.

945
01:51:32,109 --> 01:51:36,113
Why don't you let Sumita go?
Shekhar is waiting for it.

946
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:12,774
Madam, you are crying?

947
01:52:14,776 --> 01:52:17,154
l am defeated.

948
01:52:17,779 --> 01:52:21,783
l lost everything.
l am really defeated.

949
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:28,165
l am defeated, Shekhar.
l cannot take it any more.

950
01:52:36,798 --> 01:52:39,176
Come on, Sumi.
Don't talk like that.

951
01:52:39,801 --> 01:52:44,139
Have patience. Be brave.
Everything will be alright.

952
01:52:44,723 --> 01:52:46,725
No, nothing can be alright now.

953
01:52:50,145 --> 01:52:53,732
Now, there will only be ruin.

954
01:52:56,735 --> 01:53:02,157
Do you know, l have seen a streak
of rage in Kumar Bahadur's eyes.

955
01:53:03,742 --> 01:53:07,162
l had seen it earlier too.

956
01:53:10,165 --> 01:53:13,168
l even fear for Sumita now.

957
01:53:14,753 --> 01:53:17,756
What have l done out of jealousy!

958
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:28,183
Before leaving from here, l will
have to atone for my mistake.

959
01:53:30,769 --> 01:53:34,189
Yes, l will have to atone.

960
01:53:34,773 --> 01:53:38,193
Manu, is Shekhar upstairs?

961
01:53:38,777 --> 01:53:39,778
Yes, madam.

962
01:53:40,737 --> 01:53:44,116
- Then will you do me a favour?
- Sure, madam. Tell me.

963
01:53:44,741 --> 01:53:45,701
Listen.

964
01:54:01,133 --> 01:54:03,135
Madam, Kumar Bahadur is back.

965
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,138
- Remember everything l told you?
- Yes.

966
01:54:06,763 --> 01:54:08,724
And listen,
switch off the hall lights.

967
01:54:08,891 --> 01:54:09,892
Okay.

968
01:54:25,782 --> 01:54:29,161
Don't cry Sumi,
everything happens for good.

969
01:54:30,162 --> 01:54:34,166
For good?
How can l assume that?

970
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:43,091
Don't cry Sumi,
l am with you.

971
01:54:43,717 --> 01:54:47,721
Look Sumi, everyone doesn't
get happiness in life.

972
01:54:48,722 --> 01:54:54,728
And those who don't, have to win
it with sacrifice and penance.

973
01:54:56,146 --> 01:55:01,735
Have patience. Be brave.
l am always with you.

974
01:55:02,736 --> 01:55:05,739
Don't worry,
everything will be alright.

975
01:55:09,743 --> 01:55:17,167
How long can l spend my
nights staying up crying?

976
01:55:18,752 --> 01:55:21,171
You have
forgotten what l told you.

977
01:55:21,755 --> 01:55:25,759
Remember, Kumar Bahadur
is a helpless man.

978
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:29,179
He needs support.
He is your husband.

979
01:55:29,763 --> 01:55:34,184
Only you can give
him love and caring.

980
01:55:41,692 --> 01:55:47,698
Mother, give me courage.
Give me courage to bear this.

981
01:55:50,117 --> 01:55:55,122
Tell me mother,
how do l keep him happy?

982
01:56:20,731 --> 01:56:24,151
- Sir!
- What happened?

983
01:56:24,735 --> 01:56:27,738
Madam has suddenly taken ill.
Kumar Bahadur is not home.

984
01:56:28,155 --> 01:56:30,157
lf you could please
come and look her up.

985
01:56:30,741 --> 01:56:33,160
Come...but how come
the lights went off suddenly?

986
01:56:33,744 --> 01:56:35,162
Maybe some
problem with the supply.

987
01:56:35,746 --> 01:56:37,748
You go to her room,
l'll inform the office.

988
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:58,101
Surprised?

989
01:57:00,729 --> 01:57:01,730
lt's me.

990
01:57:02,731 --> 01:57:04,733
So this is your illness?

991
01:57:05,108 --> 01:57:07,110
l truly am very sick.

992
01:57:07,736 --> 01:57:09,738
Why have you
called me here like this?

993
01:57:10,113 --> 01:57:12,741
lf l hadn't called you like this,
would you have come at all?

994
01:57:13,116 --> 01:57:16,745
- Madam Madhuri!
- Just call me Madhuri.

995
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:20,123
Just touch and
see how hot my body it.

996
01:57:20,332 --> 01:57:21,333
Disgusting!

997
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:25,128
You left in a huff that day. You
will have to stay with me today.

998
01:57:25,337 --> 01:57:27,130
What's wrong with you?
Leave me!

999
01:57:27,756 --> 01:57:29,132
No, l won't leave you.

1000
01:57:29,341 --> 01:57:30,926
You should feel
ashamed of yourself!

1001
01:57:56,702 --> 01:57:59,121
You will have to leave.

1002
01:57:59,705 --> 01:58:01,123
l know that.

1003
01:58:01,707 --> 01:58:05,711
Because the respect l gave you,
you misused it.

1004
01:58:06,712 --> 01:58:09,131
Respect? Whose respect?

1005
01:58:10,716 --> 01:58:12,926
Kumar Bahadur's
mistress is not respected.

1006
01:58:13,135 --> 01:58:14,720
Don't talk like that.

1007
01:58:20,726 --> 01:58:23,145
Such temper on hearing the truth?

1008
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:28,734
Listen Madhuri,
leave this house in a day or two.

1009
01:58:29,735 --> 01:58:31,737
You are not worthy of my love.

1010
01:58:32,154 --> 01:58:36,158
Love?
You never loved me.

1011
01:58:36,742 --> 01:58:38,744
You only love yourself.

1012
01:58:40,078 --> 01:58:44,666
You only wanted to fulfil your
desire to have a doll.

1013
01:58:45,083 --> 01:58:50,088
l wanted to keep you as the
lady of the house. But...

1014
01:58:50,714 --> 01:58:52,090
Who asked you
for this vain honour?

1015
01:58:52,716 --> 01:58:55,093
Did you give me
the status of a wife?

1016
01:58:55,719 --> 01:58:59,097
No. Because you
have bought me with money.

1017
01:58:59,723 --> 01:59:02,684
You wanted to make me
like you wanted me to be.

1018
01:59:03,727 --> 01:59:05,103
But you had no patience.

1019
01:59:05,729 --> 01:59:08,690
Like your other trophies, even l
was left in a corner of the house.

1020
01:59:09,733 --> 01:59:13,111
Did you look at me lovingly
even once in the last 10 years?

1021
01:59:13,737 --> 01:59:17,699
Did you notice how much
worthy l made myself of you?

1022
01:59:19,117 --> 01:59:23,705
You talk of love?
You don't know to love.

1023
01:59:24,122 --> 01:59:27,709
You don't understand a woman's
feelings. You never can.

1024
01:59:28,126 --> 01:59:31,129
What you did with
Shekhar today ...

1025
01:59:31,755 --> 01:59:34,716
... after that, don't you
feel ashamed to say all this?

1026
01:59:35,133 --> 01:59:38,720
No! And there is no point
in telling you why l did that.

1027
01:59:38,929 --> 01:59:42,057
You won't understand.
You have gone mad with rage.

1028
01:59:42,182 --> 01:59:46,687
- Mad? l am mad?
- Yes, you are mad!

1029
01:59:47,104 --> 01:59:51,066
Madhuri, you leave right now!

1030
01:59:51,692 --> 01:59:55,696
- Where? On the street?
- Wherever, but leave this place.

1031
01:59:56,113 --> 01:59:58,699
lf you need money,
take it from the cashier.

1032
01:59:59,116 --> 02:00:00,075
Alright.

1033
02:00:06,707 --> 02:00:10,127
l cannot tell you my new address,
l'll inform you later.

1034
02:00:10,711 --> 02:00:12,713
l don't need
to know your address.

1035
02:00:13,714 --> 02:00:16,133
But when your game with
the new doll is over ...

1036
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:20,137
.. when you throw Sumita out,
she will need my address.

1037
02:00:20,721 --> 02:00:23,724
Because you have bought
Sumita too. You don't love her.

1038
02:01:48,725 --> 02:01:52,729
Great, Chhotu!
You really are brave.

1039
02:01:53,146 --> 02:01:55,732
- But atleast hold the gun right.
- What?

1040
02:01:56,149 --> 02:02:00,153
-ls Kumar Bahadur home?
-He's gone out with Sumita madam.

1041
02:02:00,737 --> 02:02:03,156
- Where did they go suddenly?
- l don't know.

1042
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:06,159
But he said they are going
on a tour around the country.

1043
02:02:06,368 --> 02:02:07,953
- When did they go?
- Two days ago.

1044
02:02:08,161 --> 02:02:10,747
A day before they left,
even Madhuri madam left.

1045
02:02:11,164 --> 02:02:12,165
Madhuri madam left?

1046
02:02:12,749 --> 02:02:15,169
Yes, first she left,
then Kumar Bahadur and madam.

1047
02:02:16,753 --> 02:02:20,757
- Here's your reward.
- Reward?

1048
02:02:21,175 --> 02:02:24,178
Keep it.
You've given me very good news.

1049
02:02:51,121 --> 02:02:55,125
This tomb of Chisti.

1050
02:02:56,126 --> 02:02:59,755
Any wish you ask for
is fulfilled here.

1051
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:01,757
That is what the people believe.

1052
02:03:02,132 --> 02:03:04,760
Emperor Akbar had asked
for a son from him ...

1053
02:03:04,968 --> 02:03:07,137
... who could be the
heir to the Mughul throne.

1054
02:03:07,763 --> 02:03:12,142
l know. And that son was Salim,
who became the Emperor.

1055
02:03:13,769 --> 02:03:16,146
Look, so many people
have tied ...

1056
02:03:16,355 --> 02:03:20,150
... the thread for their
wish fulfillment since then.

1057
02:03:26,782 --> 02:03:29,159
- Even l will tie a thread.
- Okay.

1058
02:03:40,712 --> 02:03:41,713
Here.

1059
02:03:44,716 --> 02:03:46,134
What will you wish for?

1060
02:03:51,723 --> 02:03:53,141
Why don't you tell me?

1061
02:03:54,726 --> 02:03:58,146
What wish are you making
that you cannot tell me?

1062
02:04:04,152 --> 02:04:08,740
Dear Shekhar, l took Sumita
and left on a tour suddenly.

1063
02:04:08,949 --> 02:04:13,161
We visited quite a few places.
We are in Agra since 2-3 days.

1064
02:04:13,745 --> 02:04:16,164
We are planning to stay here
for a few more days.

1065
02:04:16,748 --> 02:04:22,171
You also come here. lt's the
full moon night in a few days.

1066
02:04:22,754 --> 02:04:24,173
Come before that.

1067
02:04:24,756 --> 02:04:28,760
Even Sumita will be happy.
Do come.

1068
02:04:29,761 --> 02:04:34,183
Bring along your gun.
Don't forget.

1069
02:04:34,766 --> 02:04:39,771
You had once said you haven't
used your gun since many days.

1070
02:04:40,105 --> 02:04:43,692
We can take care
of that complain too.

1071
02:04:57,748 --> 02:05:00,125
Get up,
it's going to be evening now.

1072
02:05:00,751 --> 02:05:03,128
- Come on.
- Will l have to come?

1073
02:05:03,754 --> 02:05:07,132
- But where?
- You are strange, Kumar Bahadur.

1074
02:05:07,341 --> 02:05:09,134
You said we will
go out in the evening.

1075
02:05:09,343 --> 02:05:10,761
Now you don't even want
to step out of the hotel.

1076
02:05:11,762 --> 02:05:15,724
Shekhar, l have
visited Agra 13 times.

1077
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:19,144
That's bad.
Unlucky 13!

1078
02:05:22,773 --> 02:05:24,149
Sumita has come.

1079
02:05:26,777 --> 02:05:29,738
Look Sumita, you two go.

1080
02:05:30,781 --> 02:05:34,743
Why delay? You must not
waste the time that is left.

1081
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:37,746
- Won't you come along?
- That is what l am telling him.

1082
02:05:37,955 --> 02:05:39,373
- But he refuses to listen.
- But why?

1083
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:41,124
l am not feeling well.

1084
02:05:41,291 --> 02:05:42,709
Then we won't go today.
You are not feeling well.

1085
02:05:42,709 --> 02:05:43,710
We'll go tomorrow.

1086
02:05:43,836 --> 02:05:50,133
No, Shekhar is our guest.
We have called him from so far.

1087
02:05:50,717 --> 02:05:54,137
He has taken pains to come here.
We should not disappoint him.

1088
02:06:30,757 --> 02:06:36,180
- What are you thinking?
- He is not feeling well.

1089
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:38,765
l am not
enjoying this outing.

1090
02:06:39,183 --> 02:06:41,685
You are right,
even l'm not enjoying it.

1091
02:06:43,103 --> 02:06:47,691
Sumi, how badly we
misunderstand people.

1092
02:06:48,108 --> 02:06:52,112
Now look, it is not at all
difficult to understand Kumar.

1093
02:06:53,113 --> 02:06:56,116
So simple,
so open minded.

1094
02:06:56,700 --> 02:06:58,702
He is a little whimsical, but...

1095
02:06:58,869 --> 02:07:00,704
God! Started
giving your lecture again?

1096
02:07:01,121 --> 02:07:02,706
l am not lecturing,
l am telling the truth.

1097
02:07:03,123 --> 02:07:08,712
The more l'm getting to know him,
the more l like him.

1098
02:07:09,129 --> 02:07:13,717
No one can give me so
much love and understanding.

1099
02:07:14,718 --> 02:07:16,136
Alright, now let's go.

1100
02:07:52,714 --> 02:07:55,092
A crowd of people
come here to see this.

1101
02:07:56,718 --> 02:08:01,098
But no one thinks, that when
everyone has to die one day ...

1102
02:08:01,723 --> 02:08:07,104
... then why do we have feelings
of enmity, jealousy, killing?

1103
02:08:11,733 --> 02:08:15,112
My legs will
tire walking with you.

1104
02:08:24,746 --> 02:08:29,126
Sumi, sitting here,
Emperor Shahjahan ...

1105
02:08:29,751 --> 02:08:34,756
... used to watch his
monument of love, the Taj Mahal.

1106
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:41,096
l really feel
sad for Shahjahan.

1107
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:45,267
Shekhar, remember Tagore's
poem Shahjahan' ...

1108
02:08:45,684 --> 02:08:47,686
... which you had translated.
Recite it for me.

1109
02:08:48,687 --> 02:08:51,690
l have heard it several
times from you before.

1110
02:08:52,107 --> 02:08:53,692
But l never have enough of it.

1111
02:09:03,118 --> 02:09:05,704
Playing Patience'?

1112
02:09:07,706 --> 02:09:10,125
To check how
much patience l have.

1113
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:11,710
What did you find?

1114
02:09:12,127 --> 02:09:16,715
l forget the Queen and the Jack
among the other numbers.

1115
02:09:17,132 --> 02:09:25,140
l do notice the Jack sometimes,
but l cannot find the Queen.

1116
02:09:26,725 --> 02:09:30,145
The poor King is left alone.

1117
02:09:34,733 --> 02:09:37,736
Anyway, forget that.

1118
02:09:38,737 --> 02:09:42,074
Tell me, how did you enjoy
the Taj Mahal by moonlight?

1119
02:09:42,699 --> 02:09:44,660
lt was beautiful.

1120
02:09:48,705 --> 02:09:52,084
A companion you like,
moonlit night, mysterious Taj.

1121
02:09:52,709 --> 02:09:55,671
- What do you mean?
- l mean, Sumita.

1122
02:09:56,088 --> 02:09:57,673
She understands the
Taj Mahal's beauty.

1123
02:09:58,715 --> 02:09:59,675
Please sit down.

1124
02:10:00,717 --> 02:10:04,096
Shekhar, even l am
not a bad companion.

1125
02:10:04,721 --> 02:10:08,684
On the 1 7th, the full moon night,
when you come to see ...

1126
02:10:08,851 --> 02:10:12,729
... Fatehpur Sikri with me,
you will know.

1127
02:10:12,855 --> 02:10:17,109
l have heard of seeing the
Taj on the full moon night.

1128
02:10:17,734 --> 02:10:21,697
Everyone has seen the Taj,
but one who has not seen ...

1129
02:10:21,864 --> 02:10:25,117
... Fatehpur Sikri on full
moon night, has not seen Agra.

1130
02:10:25,325 --> 02:10:28,120
- What are you saying?
- l'm telling the truth.

1131
02:10:28,745 --> 02:10:32,708
But there is something.
Are you afraid of ghosts?

1132
02:10:32,916 --> 02:10:36,753
Not at all.But what connection do
ghosts have with Fatehpur Sikri?

1133
02:10:37,129 --> 02:10:41,091
They do. That is why
l asked you to get your gun.

1134
02:10:41,675 --> 02:10:46,096
You are joking. And anyway,
even if l believe you ...

1135
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:49,683
... what can we do?
Ghosts don't have a body.

1136
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:53,687
Nothing will happen to the ghost,
but it will give us courage.

1137
02:10:53,896 --> 02:10:54,897
How?

1138
02:10:56,690 --> 02:11:01,111
Come, Sumi. Shekhar wants to
see Fatehpur Sikri with us ...

1139
02:11:01,695 --> 02:11:02,696
... on full moon night.

1140
02:11:03,113 --> 02:11:05,073
- l told him...
- There are ghosts there.

1141
02:11:05,282 --> 02:11:07,117
- But l don't believe him.
- You don't?

1142
02:11:07,701 --> 02:11:09,286
Sumi, shall l tell him
Negro Suleiman's story ...

1143
02:11:09,703 --> 02:11:10,704
... which l'd told you?

1144
02:11:13,707 --> 02:11:15,709
Why are you
unnecessarily scaring him?

1145
02:11:16,126 --> 02:11:20,088
- l'm not scared.
- Shekhar, don't blame me later.

1146
02:11:20,714 --> 02:11:21,924
Sumi, you are witness.

1147
02:11:22,132 --> 02:11:24,718
Neither will l blame you,
nor do l need her evidence.

1148
02:11:24,927 --> 02:11:26,303
- Let's go.
- Now?

1149
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:30,140
- Right now.
- We need to prepare ourselves.

1150
02:11:30,724 --> 02:11:33,727
- Prepare for what?
- Have patience, Shekhar.

1151
02:11:34,144 --> 02:11:36,104
Patience pays.

1152
02:11:36,730 --> 02:11:40,734
- Sumita, even you will come?
- At night, in this cold weather?

1153
02:11:41,151 --> 02:11:43,737
No.
l have seen it by day.

1154
02:11:55,749 --> 02:11:57,167
Did you finish
taking his measurements?

1155
02:11:57,251 --> 02:11:58,252
What?

1156
02:11:58,335 --> 02:12:00,754
l asked, did you finish
taking his measurement?

1157
02:12:00,963 --> 02:12:01,964
Yes.

1158
02:12:02,172 --> 02:12:04,758
These clothes must reach
the hotel by the 15th.

1159
02:12:04,883 --> 02:12:05,884
What?

1160
02:12:06,176 --> 02:12:08,762
These clothes must reach
the hotel by the 15th.

1161
02:12:08,971 --> 02:12:11,765
Sure.

1162
02:12:12,766 --> 02:12:13,767
Good day.

1163
02:12:19,773 --> 02:12:23,193
This shoes is okay,
send it to the hotel.

1164
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:24,361
Sure.

1165
02:12:27,781 --> 02:12:30,784
Tailor's shop,
a traditional footwear.

1166
02:12:30,909 --> 02:12:32,786
What is all this about?

1167
02:12:32,911 --> 02:12:37,207
We are going to Fatehpur Sikri
on the night of 1 7th, right?

1168
02:12:37,374 --> 02:12:39,793
Yes, but what is all this for?

1169
02:12:40,127 --> 02:12:45,716
Without the Mughul attire,
and Mughul spirit ...

1170
02:12:45,924 --> 02:12:49,136
.. you will not see
Fatehpur Sikri's true shades.

1171
02:13:06,737 --> 02:13:10,157
Are you alright?
...Come.

1172
02:13:12,743 --> 02:13:16,747
Shekhar, if we stand on that
terrace ...

1173
02:13:16,914 --> 02:13:20,751
... we will be able to hear
the clang of swords ...

1174
02:13:20,959 --> 02:13:24,755
... the tinkle of anklets,
romantic words ...

1175
02:13:24,963 --> 02:13:27,174
... and tales of conspiracy.

1176
02:13:28,759 --> 02:13:32,179
They are all
hidden in these stones.

1177
02:13:32,387 --> 02:13:36,767
On a full moon night,
they all come out.

1178
02:13:37,768 --> 02:13:41,730
They talk, sing, laugh.

1179
02:13:43,732 --> 02:13:48,111
And sharpen swords on the stone.

1180
02:13:48,737 --> 02:13:51,740
Look, that's the Minar.

1181
02:13:52,741 --> 02:13:54,743
lmagine.

1182
02:13:55,118 --> 02:14:01,124
Two elephants are fighting with
full force to kill each other.

1183
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:03,752
Do you hear
the elephants grunting?

1184
02:14:05,754 --> 02:14:09,758
Yes. Give me some more wine.

1185
02:14:16,765 --> 02:14:22,771
Shekhar, this is Emperor Akbar's
Hindu wife, Jodhabai's palace.

1186
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:35,784
That's his Christian wife,
Mariam's palace.

1187
02:14:36,785 --> 02:14:40,122
When the Quran was read
in the Masjid ...

1188
02:14:40,706 --> 02:14:45,127
... Hindu mantras
were read in Jodhabai's palace.

1189
02:14:45,711 --> 02:14:51,717
And the Bible chants were
heard from Mariam's palace.

1190
02:14:53,719 --> 02:14:57,723
Emperor Akbar used to sit
here and hear Tansen's music ...

1191
02:14:57,931 --> 02:15:00,142
... spellbound.

1192
02:15:13,739 --> 02:15:17,159
Can you hear the heartbeats
of Fatehpur Sikri?

1193
02:15:17,743 --> 02:15:20,162
Do you feel the mystery
of the full moon night?

1194
02:15:20,746 --> 02:15:28,170
Yes, l'm seeing it, l hear it.
l see everything before my eyes.

1195
02:15:29,755 --> 02:15:31,173
Give me more wine.

1196
02:15:55,739 --> 02:16:01,703
Shekhar, you stay here,
l'll just be back.

1197
02:16:03,747 --> 02:16:04,706
l'll keep this here.

1198
02:16:08,752 --> 02:16:12,714
- You won't get scared, will you?
- Ofcourse not.

1199
02:17:01,722 --> 02:17:03,724
- Why...
- Who is it?

1200
02:17:04,725 --> 02:17:07,728
This is not loaded.
Give it to me. Let's go.

1201
02:17:13,734 --> 02:17:17,154
ln that room, as per
Emperor Akbar's wishes ...

1202
02:17:17,738 --> 02:17:19,990
... the great poet Faizi,
translated the Mahabharat ...

1203
02:17:20,157 --> 02:17:21,116
... in Urdu.

1204
02:17:21,742 --> 02:17:24,745
And narrated the eternal
love story of Nal Damyanti.

1205
02:17:25,162 --> 02:17:28,123
- Can you hear it, Shekhar?
- Yes, Kumar Bahadur.

1206
02:17:28,749 --> 02:17:31,168
l see everything clearly.

1207
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:43,096
Look, Emperor Akbar and the
Queen is sitting on the throne.

1208
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:46,099
And the most beautiful
woman of the Harem ...

1209
02:17:46,183 --> 02:17:48,101
... salutes, and begins to sing.

1210
02:17:55,692 --> 02:18:00,113
The flattering steps
start moving again

1211
02:18:05,702 --> 02:18:10,123
l give you peace
and become restless myself

1212
02:18:20,133 --> 02:18:25,138
Look! That beautiful
dancer's name is Khurshid.

1213
02:18:25,722 --> 02:18:28,725
She will come to Gulbag
after she finishes her dance.

1214
02:18:29,142 --> 02:18:33,730
Do you know why? Her two
lovers are desperate for her.

1215
02:18:34,147 --> 02:18:36,733
One hand is waiting,
Mubarrak ...

1216
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:39,152
... and on the other,
is Umrao Sallauddin.

1217
02:18:39,361 --> 02:18:40,696
Blinded by jealousy, ...

1218
02:18:40,821 --> 02:18:46,076
... Mubarrak had imprisoned
Sallauddin slave, Negro Suleiman.

1219
02:18:46,702 --> 02:18:51,081
Because Suleiman has
forcibly taken Kurshid ...

1220
02:18:51,707 --> 02:18:54,084
... and put her
in Sallauddin lap.

1221
02:18:54,710 --> 02:18:59,715
Mubarrak tied up
Suleiman in chains.

1222
02:19:00,090 --> 02:19:04,094
And then skinned him with
his sword and killed him.

1223
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:09,725
And then, one day,
carrying a gun in hand...

1224
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:13,103
... Mubarrak hid himself
behind that pillar.

1225
02:19:13,729 --> 02:19:17,733
Kurshid was coming
to meet Sallauddin.

1226
02:19:18,108 --> 02:19:21,737
Seeing her, Mubarrak fired a
shot. Kurshid fell dead.

1227
02:19:22,738 --> 02:19:24,740
While dying,
Kurshid said ...

1228
02:19:25,115 --> 02:19:30,746
Dear Mubarrak, there was
poison mixed in the wine'

1229
02:19:31,121 --> 02:19:33,123
And that goblet
was for Sallauddin'

1230
02:19:33,749 --> 02:19:36,752
And there was
love in my heart for you'

1231
02:19:37,127 --> 02:19:39,755
Hearing this,
Mubarrak shuddered.

1232
02:19:40,088 --> 02:19:47,095
ln that crazy moment,
he shot himself too.

1233
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:53,101
Do you know, Kurshid,
Suleiman, Mubarrak's souls...

1234
02:19:53,685 --> 02:19:56,688
Look!
Negro Suleiman is coming.

1235
02:19:57,689 --> 02:20:01,109
Negro Suleiman is coming.
Negro Suleiman is coming!

1236
02:20:23,715 --> 02:20:27,719
Shekhar, don't be afraid,
he ran away.

1237
02:20:43,694 --> 02:20:45,070
Look!
Kurshid is coming.

1238
02:21:00,711 --> 02:21:03,088
Desire! Wish!

1239
02:21:04,715 --> 02:21:07,676
Sumi, in this attire?
Over here?

1240
02:21:07,885 --> 02:21:10,095
How?
Why Sumi, why?!

1241
02:21:10,721 --> 02:21:13,098
- To scare you.
- Scare me?

1242
02:21:14,725 --> 02:21:20,105
- And that Suleiman, the gunshot?
- lt was all an act.

1243
02:21:21,732 --> 02:21:24,693
And the bullet
that hit me was real.

1244
02:21:25,736 --> 02:21:33,702
Shekhar, call him here.
Call him, please!

1245
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:37,706
Call him, Shekhar.

1246
02:21:45,756 --> 02:21:49,718
Blinded by jealousy, what a
disastrous thing you have done.

1247
02:21:50,135 --> 02:21:51,720
What have you done!

1248
02:21:59,770 --> 02:22:03,732
Listen...listen.

1249
02:22:09,154 --> 02:22:17,162
l love only my husband.

1250
02:22:20,791 --> 02:22:24,169
You had asked me that day ...

1251
02:22:26,797 --> 02:22:31,176
.. what l wished
for at Chisti's tomb?

1252
02:22:34,805 --> 02:22:40,143
l wished to be a mother.

1253
02:22:40,727 --> 02:22:42,729
What!
You wanted to be a mother?

1254
02:22:43,146 --> 02:22:50,737
Believe me, that is what
l wished for that day.

1255
02:22:55,742 --> 02:22:58,745
l wished to sire your children.

1256
02:22:59,746 --> 02:23:05,752
Sumi, why didn't you
tell me this before?

1257
02:23:06,753 --> 02:23:09,756
lt's too late now.

1258
02:23:17,764 --> 02:23:20,767
What have l done?
What will l do now?

1259
02:23:24,771 --> 02:23:26,190
What will l do now?

1260
02:23:30,194 --> 02:23:31,778
What will l do now?

1261
02:23:36,783 --> 02:23:39,786
- What are you doing!
- Leave me, Shekhar.

1262
02:23:40,120 --> 02:23:41,705
What kind of madness is this?

1263
02:23:41,872 --> 02:23:45,125
- Let me atone for my sin.
- No, Kumar.

1264
02:23:45,209 --> 02:23:48,128
Sumita is calling me.
She is waiting for me.

1265
02:23:48,212 --> 02:23:49,713
There is only
one bullet in this.

1266
02:23:49,880 --> 02:23:51,131
l won't let you do this.

1267
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:55,135
- Leave me.
- No!

1268
02:24:17,741 --> 02:24:20,160
l killed you too!

1269
02:24:20,744 --> 02:24:24,164
Shekhar, l killed you too!

1270
02:24:28,752 --> 02:24:33,173
Sumi, l killed Shekhar too.

1271
02:24:33,757 --> 02:24:38,762
Sumi, listen.
Are you listening?

1272
02:24:39,763 --> 02:24:43,725
l killed Shekhar
and even you.

1273
02:24:51,733 --> 02:24:53,735
You are laughing Sonmai?

1274
02:24:54,736 --> 02:24:57,739
Because your curse has come true?

1275
02:25:00,742 --> 02:25:05,747
Laugh...laugh...laugh!

1276
02:25:06,748 --> 02:25:10,127
Queen Sonmai,
your curse has come true.

1277
02:25:10,752 --> 02:25:14,131
Laugh!
Curse more!

1278
02:25:39,156 --> 02:25:41,116
Yes, l committed the murders.

1279
02:25:42,701 --> 02:25:45,120
l killed Shekhar.

1280
02:25:45,704 --> 02:25:48,123
l killed Sumita.

1281
02:25:48,332 --> 02:25:53,128
Because Sumita loved Shekhar.

1282
02:26:07,142 --> 02:26:10,729
Mad?
Kumar turned mad?

1283
02:26:11,730 --> 02:26:15,150
God, what have you done!

1284
02:26:22,741 --> 02:26:28,163
Sumita and Shekhar's
souls wander here even today.

1285
02:26:29,748 --> 02:26:33,168
Every full moon night in the
month of Maghi',at sharp 12 ...

1286
02:26:34,753 --> 02:26:38,757
Look!
Sumita is coming.

1287
02:27:13,125 --> 02:27:16,128
lt is very late.
Go home now.

1288
02:27:16,753 --> 02:27:21,717
- You!
- l am alive.

1289
02:27:23,135 --> 02:27:27,014
Every year, on the full
moon night of Maghi' ...

02:27:27,139 --> 02:27:28,724
... l have to enact
Sumita's role.

1291
02:27:30,767 --> 02:27:32,728
Or l cannot take him home.

1292
02:27:34,771 --> 02:27:35,731
Good bye.

1293
02:27:43,697 --> 02:27:47,117
Listen.
Let's go now.

1294
02:27:47,701 --> 02:27:52,706
- But the blood?
- lt is washed clean now.

1295
02:27:53,123 --> 02:27:57,085
Really?
ls it washed clean?

1296
02:27:57,711 --> 02:27:59,713
Yes, it's clean.

1297
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:09,723
lt's clean.
