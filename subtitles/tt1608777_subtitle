191
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,273
Hello!

192
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,403
Turn back

193
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,473
Turn back

194
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,410
Will she?

195
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,626
She actually turned!

196
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,031
She's coming back, sir.

197
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,438
l don't wanna go home. Now
she'll say take me away.

198
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,305
Papa's calling

199
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,570
- So go. Hurry

200
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,643
He wants you to come home.

201
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:17,258
Your film is bland

202
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,258
Bland?

203
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,390
Get some tea

204
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,525
Go.

205
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,267
lt needs spicing up. A sexy song

206
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,409
A sexy song?
lt's a family love story

207
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,606
How are families born?

208
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,614
Show a bit of that, too

209
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:41,877
Get smart

210
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,283
But that bit won't fit in the story

211
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,291
That's easy

212
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,291
Try this. The girl's wedding party

213
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,496
A sexy song is sung there

214
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,700
Uncle,wedding party? But
my heroine elopes to marry

215
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,294
Change the damn story

216
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,970
Your stupid films
damage our culture

217
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,435
Uncle, how can l change the story?

218
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,309
Shruti's marriage is fixed.

219
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,980
lt's not a joke.

220
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,861
The boy is from Canada.

221
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,730
l told them Shruti is an actress

222
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,866
They were impressed

223
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,596
They want to see her film shoot.

224
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,799
l said: ''The film is
being shot in my house''

225
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,340
''What do you want to see?''

226
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,003
''A song sequence''

227
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,808
Add my song or look for
a new heroine

228
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,367
''l can't hold it any longer..''

229
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,570
''l can't hold it any longer..''

230
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,647
''Prince has grown up now.''

231
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,441
''He has become a man.''

232
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,246
''He needs love.''

233
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:25,449
''He needs love.''

234
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,735
''My beloved one is weeping..''

235
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,734
''My neighbor is weeping..''

236
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,276
''My beloved one is weeping..
My neighbor is weeping..''

237
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,008
''My husband is..''

238
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:53,547
''My husband is also jealous..''

239
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,949
''..when l come to meet you.''

240
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,286
''Prince has grown up now.''

241
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,552
''He has become aman.''

242
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:07,963
''He needs love.''

243
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,231
Cut it now.

Eloping with my sister

Hey! Have you gone mad?

265
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,558
Why are you hitting me?

266
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,775
l'm going to kill you.
- Run from here.

267
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,718
You..

Sir, l swear on Allah.. l

272
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,401
Shruti is like my sister.

273
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,669
l don't even know her phone number

274
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,266
You were all over her

275
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,938
That's acting. We
maintain a gap. No touching.

276
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,278
He was the guy on the phone.
l know it

277
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,685

Lost my voice
shouting ''action'' and ''cut''

282
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,227
Sir, l talked to him last evening..

283
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,629
He was at home all day.
He didn't call.

284
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,429
He wouldn't swear on his family

285
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,504
Father, mother, sister is God, sir

286
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,832
Must have been a wrong number.

287
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,236

293

297
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,526
We need to film the climax with you

298
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,328

Smile.- Sister.
- Shruti. Smile more. More.

More. - Get it fast.

316
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,933
Nothing left to shoot?

317
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:25,407
Some song? Can't you
write another scene?

318
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,012
Stop shooting me, Rahul.

319
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,882

00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,481
You go

558
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,616
- No l'm fine here

559
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,354
Go. Remember last night?

560
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,356
lt's my birthday today

561
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,488
- Your birthday?

562
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,365
Forget it. Even myfiance forgets

563
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,494
He's busy in Russia

564
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,629
That's far.

565
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,570
Yes, he has almost forgotten me.

566
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,902
Big risk he's taking

567
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,306
What's up, Adarsh?

568
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,503
All good. And you?

569
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:01,574
As if you cared about us. Right?

570
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,316
That's the problem with him.

571
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,318
Let's go out for tea

572
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,855
- Embarrassed to have it here?

573
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,256
Not at all

574
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,385
- Shut up

575
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,861
You weren't embarrassed
taking aloan

576
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,723
Why so coyin front of Madam?

577
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,331
Sonal,why don't you..

578
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,461
- Why bother her?

579
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,869
You owe the money

580
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,798
- l'll pay

581
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:28,675
You didn't use that tone
when you took the loan

582
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,810
You've no cash, no job etc, etc

583
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,949
So when do you pay?

584
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:40,949
- Please understand

585
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,754
Listen, Shah Rukh.
We're being polite.

586
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:49,292
Be a good boy and pay in a week

587
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,701
Or else we'll yank it
out of you. Right here

588
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,299
Get it?

589
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:03,439
Madam, don't trust him.
He's a fraud

590
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:05,776
Watch out

591
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,248
Gotit?

592
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,386
My friends. An affectionate in-joke

593
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,519
l noticed the affection

594
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,262
Let's buy you a gift

595
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:31,273
Never mind. Save the
cash for your friends

596
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:32,733
Right?

597
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,735
Come.

598
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,277
You'real kid

599
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,286
Know what Lalaji got for the
shooting incident? He sold it

600
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,288
Sold it?

601
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:57,432
A news channel paid
40,000 for the footage

602
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,303
40,000?

603
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,376
That camera is the key to a fortune

604
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,913
A hug and a kiss are worth 10,000

605
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,247
10,000?

606
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:19,653
A sex scandal fetches 70,000. Easy!

607
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:28,257
Thereal stuff.
Without telling the girl

608
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,331
Aren't you mates with
the night shift girl?

609
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,804
She isn't the type

610
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,602
Then teach her

611
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:42,943
l saw her smiling at you

612
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,415
Forget it! She's dark-skinned

613
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,750
Dark. Fair.
They'reall the same naked

614
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,292
Are you game?

615
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,227
How long will you dodge those guys?

616
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,566
She looks like easy meat

617
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,300
Hello there

618
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:16,369
Hello.

619
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,504
Bye.

620
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,247
l brought you dinner

621
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,375
- l have my own

622
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,512
l know. You always bring cold food

623
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,323
My office canteen was open.

624
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,649
So l thought of you

625
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,321
My good deed for the day.

626
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,387
You eating? Or do l throw it out?

627
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,263
Do you have a boy friend?

628
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,869
Sorry.Just asking

00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:46,670
Every one needs
someone who cares for the

00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,874
Shall l find you someone?

631
00:45:56,386 --> 00:46:03,758
Rashmi, rush me to the hospital

632
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,423
Rashmi.

633
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,846
Why don't you smile more often?

634
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,317
You could star in an ad

635
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,379
You'd be a great model

636
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,657
Why are you lying?

637
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:39,786
Lying?

638
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,265
l know l'm not beautiful

639
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,336
You are beautiful

640
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,668
But you keep it hidden inside

641
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,342
Let it out. Flaunt it

642
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,674
Style your hair. See what happens

643
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,750
What will happen?

644
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:07,347
Wow! You look almost hot

645
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:08,481
Thanks.

646
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:10,355
Cut your hair, eh? You beauty queen

647
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,226
Pity, it's got cuttoo short

648
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,431
Well, it'll grow back

649
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,632
l'm off. You're early today.

650
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,760
Showing off your hair?

651
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,637
We went to see the guy who was shot.

652
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,764
He's fine

653
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,638
'We?' Meaning?

654
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,233
Adarsh and me

655
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,213
You're looking nice

656
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,343
Thanks.

657
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,618
Why are you always
buying perfume, sir?

658
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,417
Call me Ankit

659
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,354
l'll have to keep coming back

660
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,824
Do you like this one?

661
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,232
Come for dinner, Rashmi

662
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,304
l'm waiting. Come fast.

663
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,842
Don't encourage thosesleazeballs

664
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,440
You don't know men

665
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:42,909
You're a man, too

666
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,323
Did you have a spat with Sonal?

667
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,265
Why? Did shesay anything?

668
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:05,864
That you don't have
a degree or a job.

669
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,409
Lalaji is a friend..

670
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,535
She's mental

671
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,275
She kept flirting with me.

672
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,876
l stayed away. So she talks rot

673
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,285
l didn't like what
Sonal said about you

674
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,288
You have a great personality.

675
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:30,296
You'll be good at any job

676
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,424
Don't leatureme

677
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,245
You know why l'm here?

678
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:45,772
Because l'm handsome

679
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,723
l don't care if you're
handsome or have a degree

680
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:04,391
The first day we met,
you didn't flirt with me

681
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,603
You dropped me home
likea gentleman

682
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,467
Ok. Bye.

683
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,806
You talk too much.

684
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,275
But your intentions are good

685
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,418
But that seems to be changing

686
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,360
Make something of your life, please

687
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,696
And shut Sonal up for good

688
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,632
l know you can meet any challenge..

689
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,972
.. if you set your mind to it

690
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:00,790
Rashmi?

691
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,263
Rahul.

692
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,598
Let's go for a coffee

Ok, one minute..

Adarsh. Adarsh. Come here.

696
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,549

Shruti, no drinking

700
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,362
He's filling in for Papa.

701
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:52,433
Now come. Now come fast.

702
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:53,566
Where to?

703
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:54,837
What happened?

704
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,436
- Relax. Girl talk

705
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:01,508
You like him?

706
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,313
- He's so sweet

707
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,258
Honestly?

708
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:17,665
All good? Need something?

709
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,257
Ask Adarsh

710
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,929
He said l should look after you

711
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,938
You're school friends

712
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:28,266
l had a school mate once.

713
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,404
He's a sweeper now

714
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,879
Adarsh looks out for you

715
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,282
- He's just a friend

716
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,410
A friend?

717
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,951
Have you seen the
way hel ooks at you

718
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,355
He likes you.

719
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,359
He can't take his eyes off you

720
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,354
How do you like my friend?

721
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:52,625
They look sweet together

722
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,573
She thought you were very sweet

723
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,711
You never told me your
father was dead

724
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,310
What's there to say?.

725
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,644
You're very brave

726
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,793
l'm trying to get a job

727
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:26,799
You look good when you're quiet

728
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:30,863
Why not then..

729
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,479
A kiss on the mouth
would've been perfect

730
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,830
Forget the cheek.
Get to the real thing

731
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,558
Won't this do?

732
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:02,629
What's wrong with you?

733
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,639
This isn't a family soap

734
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,767
l've given my word to the buyer

735
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,246
Why play when got no balls?

736
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,451
You falling for her?

737
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:25,652
- Are you nuts?

738
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,260
You're joking

739
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,798
- Not at this hour!

740
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,333
Please.. l am not joking.

741
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,794
You should model

742
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,240
Go for auditions

743
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,605
Go for auditions

744
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:41,807
Rashmi, one minute

745
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,681
He's always glaring at me

746
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,686
l'll kill him someday

747
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,360
He doesn'thave bad intentions

748
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,760
- Every one does

749
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,229
Adarsh

750
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,358
- To hell with Adarsh!

751
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:09,237
Don't talk to him again

752
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,368
Will you protect me from everyone?

753
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,376
You lied to Lalaji too

754
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:19,246
l did it for me. Not for you

755
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,250
What if he fired you
when he found the beer cans?

756
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:28,650
You think l'm hereto
smell the guard's bad breath?

757
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,655
l keep thinking about you.

758
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,930
You have no time for me

759
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,394
You spend all your time
spraying perfume on him

760
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,533
l wait for a smile. And
end up getting an earfl

761
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,676
Get a job! Do this.
Do that. l'm trying

762
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,345
What else should l do?

763
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:59,679
Am l not good enough without a job?

764
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,284
l haven't washed my cheek
since you kissed me last night

765
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,568
What's your problem?

766
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,634
Are you allergic
to being loved? Well?

767
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,785
Adarsh, the camera

768
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,723
Move an inch and
l'll break your leg

769
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,295
Wow! So he's back from Russia?

770
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,769
l didn't know if he'd ever return

771
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,769
Give Adarsh my wedding invite.

772
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,370
l hear he's here only at nights

773
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,507
Ok.

774
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:39,314
He wouldn't dare come
in the daytime

775
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:40,847
Meaning?

776
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,254
- Don't you know?

777
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:47,318
Those goons beat him to
pulp in front of the shop

778
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,261
So humiliating

779
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:50,857
They beat Adarsh?

780
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,664
- A royal bashing

781
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:59,333
The prince took the
loan but wouldn't pay back

782
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,676
You hang out together, right?

783
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,212
Give him the invite

784
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:05,605
Want one?

785
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,748
You look sweet with
your new haircut.

786
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,480
Want me to find you a husband?

787
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,286
Or will you do it yourself?.

788
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:17,223
See you later

789
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,306
You used to smile a lot.
What's wrong?

790
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:46,512
Tell me what's wrong

791
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:47,783
Nothing

792
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:48,915
Had your coffee?

793
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,391
Hi! - Had your coffee? Now get lost.

794
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:52,927
Get up. Get lost!

795
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,257
Adarsh, he is..

796
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,389
l know. He's your regular customer

797
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,399
Watch your tone

798
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:00,401
- My tone! Motherfcker

799
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:04,273
Who the hell are you?
ls this your shop?

800
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,398
You..

801
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,401
Who's this guy?
l'm calling the police

802
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,213
Who is he?

803
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,475
Were you spying on us?

804
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:17,746
You want to model?

805
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:18,878
-And why not?

806
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:24,221
Decent girls don't model

807
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,359
Why humour him?

808
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:27,486
- No big deal

809
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:28,621
lt is a big deal

810
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,764
l told you not to talk to him

811
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,629
Who are you to stop me?

812
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,898
Shall l tell you?

813
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:40,236
Quit this job

814
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,367
What?.

815
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:42,501
- l don't like you working here

816
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:43,704
And who'll pay the bills?

817
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:44,837
- l will.

818
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,372
What?.

819
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,574
Let's get married

820
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,311
Adarsh, you're mad

821
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,852
What's the problem?

822
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:54,312
l'll earn. You'll stay at home

823
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,448
Quit the job

824
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:58,322
Earning means working.
Not useless talk

825
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,656
Me? Useless?

826
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,924
Your dark, skinny bitch

827
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,467
Look at you. Want to be a model, eh?

828
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,800
And l'm useless? Shall l
tell Lalaji about the beer?

829
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,671
You'll be the useless one

830
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,823
Living in a gutter.
Reaching forthe stars

831
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,625
The valiantknight saving womankind

832
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:41,704
You wait like a fool
while the birds

833
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,362
enjoy the mating season

834
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,031
See for yourself

835
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:17,463
Rashmi

836
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,937
We have to go now

837
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:27,940
What?.

838
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,019
We must go at once

839
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:32,611
What happened?

840
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:36,888
Our friends are no more

841
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,359
Are you listening to me?

842
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:50,905
Rashmi,we better go

843
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:03,912
Rashmi. Rashmi. Control.
Control please, Rashmi.

844
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:29,468
Don't go

845
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:34,940
What do you want?

846
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,887
Remember Shruti? My friend

847
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,485
The one who said you
were very sweet

848
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,420
So?

849
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:52,434
She was the one who said

850
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:53,900
you liked me

851
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:59,032
Adarsh, don't go, please

852
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:03,503
What happened?

853
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:10,645
They looked so happy
in the hospital that day

854
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,720
They went to thet emple from there

855
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,259
Rashmi, what is it?

856
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:30,865
What?.

857
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,735
They got married
and went to a hotel

858
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:42,010
Her father's car
picked them up that night

859
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,018
They disappeared

860
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,013
- Meaning?

861
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:04,830
Her old driver complained
to the police a week later

862
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,433
What?.

863
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,978
They followed the driver's hunch.

864
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:15,644
Near the highway, under a bridge..

865
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,650
.. their bodies were found

866
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,451
What?.

867
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:34,267
They were chopped into pieces and

868
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:39,000
shoved into a plastic bag

869
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,673
And buried in the ground

870
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:58,692
She was the one who first told me

871
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,623
you liked me

872
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:08,769
That you looked out for me

873
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,434
That you couldn't
take your eyes off me

874
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,986
Why don't you look at me any more?

875
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,516
Did l do anything wrong?

876
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,988
Tell me, what did l do wrong?

877
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,862
Why did you shout at me?

878
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,876
Don't ever leave me. Please. Please.

879
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,957
Get Shruti back

880
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,288
Don't leave me

881
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:17,633
l love you

882
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,007
Adarsh, the camera

883
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,690
lt's off

884
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:51,858
Slowly, Adarsh..

885
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:56,799
Slowly, Adarsh..

886
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,269
Slowly, Adarsh..

887
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,960
Excuseme. - Yes.
- ls Lalaji here?

888
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,628
- Let me check

889
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:30,772
Weren't you the one
who was shot here?

890
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:35,972
You're the watchman?

891
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:37,436
Yes, sir

892
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,780
- Rashmi told me about you

893
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:51,453
l was the watchman.

894
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,255
None of the old
employees are here any longer

895
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,329
l called on Rashmi's number.

896
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:03,527
Asking her salary to be collected

897
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:06,941
You know what her mother said?

898
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:10,539
That she doesn't know any Rashmi

899
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:15,878
l said: ''But she's your daughter''

900
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,944
She said she had no daughter

901
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,346
and banged the phone down

902
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,761
l still have Rashmi's money

903
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:35,761
They did it here

904
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,764
What?.

905
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,377
The thing you saw on the CD

906
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,703
Right here

907
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,987
You saw the footage?

908
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,855
l don't watch dirty pictures

909
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,322
My cousin told me
it's all over the net

910
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,394
They call it'The Store Scandal'

911
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,470
Lots of downloads

912
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:11,998
Hugely popular

913
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:13,801
People love it

914
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,878
What about the boy?

915
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,341
Boys are boys

916
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,480
He stopped coming here

917
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,821
l hear he's getting married

918
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:33,352
Look

919
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:35,894
This was the camera

920
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,035
Sir, can't help but say

921
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:55,044
First you got shot,
then the sex scandal

922
01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:00,046
By God, the sales have
gone through the roof

923
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:14,526
THE FAME GAME

924
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,434
Go and say that to your sister.

925
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:18,267
Ma'am, l am sorry.- Will
you ask that to your mother?

926
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:19,534
Ma'am, l am sorry. - How dare you!

927
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:22,668
Bastard! l'm a respectable woman

928
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:24,002
How dare you..

929
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,808
And l'm a journalist

930
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,006
A bloody spy

931
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,676
You think you are ClD?

932
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,480
l know the Home Minister.

933
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:34,947
He calls me his sister

934
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:38,292
You got me wrong.
- You'll pay forthis.

935
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:39,554
Slandering good people

936
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,290
He thinks he is ClD?

937
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,490
Get lost from here.
There's no circus going on here.

938
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:45,757
Rickshaw.

939
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,980
More footage with you
getting thrashed

940
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,646
But you have the footage

941
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,784
lt's useless

942
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,316
How can you tell she
pimps her daughter?

943
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,253
What's wrong with you, dude?

944
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,991
What's up, Mr. Spy-Cam?

945
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:14,659
He got thrashed again

946
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,792
l didn't know the mother was mental

947
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,860
Miss Meerut was mental too?

948
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,731
That was such a tragedy

949
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,865
That could've been the
scoop of the century

950
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,670
How many stories will
you screw up, Prabhat?

951
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,016
My camera is on 24/7
since the Miss Meerut story

952
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,008
ls it on now?

953
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,876
No

954
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,616
Keep it on. Might get a shootout

955
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,887
Sell the camera you
blew your earnings on

956
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,965
l'll give you money
when l get bonus

957
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,830
Who'll give you a bonus?

958
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:56,029
Will the school
admissions wait till then?

959
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,629
She's my daughter too

960
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:01,970
Why should l have to
beg for her school fees?

961
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,370
What should l do? Die?

962
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,773
l don't care. l want the money

963
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:09,506
lfl really died, you'd weep

964
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,915
At leastl'll
collect the insurance money

965
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,249
Get lost!

966
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,236
Stop. Police!

967
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,732
Why did you jump on my fishing net?

968
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,326
l lost my balance

969
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:37,997
How you can just..- l
just slipped and.. - Why?.

970
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,534
Who pays for my
fishing net and the fish?

971
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,339
Anyone can fall

972
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,346
Don't flash your money at me

973
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,882
Don't lose your balance again

974
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,352
Let's go to a doctor

975
01:14:55,791 --> 01:15:00,626
The chemicals in the
water will ruin your skin

976
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:10,966
What's wrong with you?

977
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:15,841
What.
- Saving the world? Why stop me?

978
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,776
l wanted to die. Why
did you interfere?

979
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:21,907
You wanted to die?

980
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:25,316
- No. l was practicing diving

981
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,650
l saved yourlife and you..
- Thank You!

982
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:29,651

- l don't have anymoney

984
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:32,984
That's why l am folding hands.

985
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:34,523
Who wants your money?

986
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,988
What then? Sex.

987
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,723
- What?

988
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,998
l don't accept favours.

989
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,669
You saved my life, thank you

990
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,274
Now if you wantsex, then
take me wherever you want..

991
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,537
A blow job? A fuck?

992
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:50,737
Shutup!

993
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,275
Where do you live?

994
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,681
What's your name?

995
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,482
Mrignaina Biswas. l
ran away from home.

996
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:06,357
No money. No house. Nothing. Happy?.

997
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,955
l got everything but your name

998
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,432
Mrignaina. Naina

999
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:20,966
Why commit suicide?

1000
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,301
-A rabid dog bit me

1001
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,973
That's no reason

1002
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,245
Wait till you hear the dog's name

1003
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:31,912

1004
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:33,979
- The pop singer?

1005
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,984
''You're cute when you're naked''

1006
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,286
Veg dumplings. Hurry

1007
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:42,991
The drowning has made me hungry

1008
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:45,663
Serve us. Quick

1009
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:47,865
So what about Loki?

1010
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:51,862
He promised to launch
mein his music video

1011
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:55,603
Launch? - Launch.

1012
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:59,873
A launch in a Loki Local's music
video. You know what that means?

01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,881
You know his girls, Nilofer, Ruhi..

They're superstars today

1015

They charge millions

01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:11,625
So you're a dancer?

1017
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:15,625
No. A doctor.

1018
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,626
Can't you tell by my
figure that l'm a dancer?

1019
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:19,758
Ok, ok, right..

1020
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,835
What happened next?

1021
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:26,972

1022
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:28,968

Give me time

1028
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:51,396
But he couldn't wait. So impatient

1029
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:56,400
A Russian slut got the music video.

1030
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,464
He spat me out

1031
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:05,480
Bastard. Scum.
White pussy chasing dog

- Wrong?

1109
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:17,255
Even when you're drunk..

1110
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,919
.. you don't fancy me

1111
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,264
Loki ignores me too

1112
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:29,668
Am l so plain?

1113
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,013
Loki's in town for three more days

1114
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,556
l'll do as you say

1115
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:57,622
Let's try again?

1116
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:05,302
lmagine l'm Loki

1117
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:11,837
Why are you laughing?

1118
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:16,382
You? Loki?

1119
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:18,847
Wassup, baby?

1120
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:20,980
- l'm good

1121
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:27,791
What's wrong? Say something

1122
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:29,787
Like what?.

1123
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,799
''Hi. Hello. Let's have sex.''

1124
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:35,002
How else do we get the footage?

1125
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:37,470
How's life, darling?

1126
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:43,738
What's life without you?

1127
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:46,803
Didn't you miss me?

1128
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:52,345
This is good. Better

1129
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:00,819
Naina, you.. Stop laughing so much.

1130
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:03,964
A sting is about winning trust.

1131
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,629
Nobody opens up without it

1132
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:09,970
lt took three months to
trap the Minister's secretary

1133
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:11,966
Where's your wife?

1134
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:15,641
Why are you buzzing around me?

1135
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:22,506
Naughty girl! Your camera is on

1136
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,984
Sorry. Sorry. Very sorry.

1137
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:38,892
''You look good naughty.
You look like a nice girl.''

1138
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:53,472
Answer the phone

1139
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:56,680
Loki, sir

1140
01:25:57,051 --> 01:26:00,418
- How's your leg? Need anything?

1141
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,683
Nothing. Just meet me

1142
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,884
lt's been ages since
l heard you sing

1143
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,428
Watch me on TV

1144
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,966
l want to see you play the guitar

1145
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:15,903
You me and the guitar

1146
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,700
Your voice is so lovely

1147
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,967
Everything about me is lovely

1148
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:29,647
l only had you and
you've forgotten me too

1149
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:31,782
My dear..

1150
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,581
l've worn out my
fingers dialing your number

1151
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,991
This is very bad.

1152
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:52,797
Ok?

1153
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:23,962
l don't want to shoot any more.

1154
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,229
Stay away from me for an hour

1155
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:51,990
Shall l shoot you?

1156
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:02,742
l never load my gun

1157
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:04,471
You know my temper.

1158
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:06,677
l shoot someone. l hang

1159
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:09,813
You shouldn't get angry

1160
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:13,953
You look handsome when you're happy

1161
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:16,352
You can make me happier

1162
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,952
Sir, what do you want?

1163
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:29,770
See my built-in bar? Scotch

1164
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:35,441
Ketchup. Chocolate

1165
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:37,841
No one to shar ewith

1166
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,440
l understand. You're lonely

1167
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:44,976
l am also lonely, sir

1168
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,715
You're the one running away.

1169
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:48,981
Check this out

1170
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,460
Where can l go, sir?

1171
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:57,923
You're my guide

1172
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:59,727
Listen to your guide then

1173
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,600
Try me out

1174
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,931
Come inside

1175
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,610
Look.A washbasin

1176
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:15,539
Two

1177
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,685
Bathroom. Hot and cold

1178
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:32,690
Second room.

1179
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,968
The only make-up van with a bedroom

1180
01:29:38,339 --> 01:29:39,363
Butit's empty

1181
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:52,985
Check if l have a fever?

1182
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,984
You'realways hot, sir

1183
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,659
You make me burn

1184
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:10,995
You were saying, sir?

1185
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:21,673
You want a music video?

1186
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,474
l'll give you a video

1187
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,479
You want a music video?

1188
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:30,546
Want, sir. Want.

1189
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:32,349
Then come to me.

1190
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,823
Why bother with stupid auditions?

1191
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:36,687
Meaning?

1192
01:30:36,798 --> 01:30:39,358
Better to fuck one,the king of pop,

1193
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:41,295
Than two hundred

1194
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:43,961
Ok, sir.

1195
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,303
lt's the chemistry that makes..

1196
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:49,672
..the music video a hit

1197
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:53,370
Right?

1198
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:57,979
Sit down

1199
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:07,985
Come on. Sit down. Be comfortable.

1200
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,507
Stay with me. l'll protect you

1201
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:29,273
No one will touch you.

1202
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:32,546
You are with Loki. No one has
the guts messing with you.

1203
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,453
l'll wrap you in satin.

1204
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:42,353
Like a doll

1205
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,424
What do you say?

1206
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:51,339
l'll wrap you in satin.

1207
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:52,567
l'll wrap you in satin.

1208
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,032
Likea doll

1209
01:31:57,745 --> 01:31:58,769
Give me your hand, Naina

1210
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:04,784
Where did you find her, Prabhat?

1211
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:06,777
Are you a professional?

1212
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:07,980
No,Just a friend

1213
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:10,321
''l'll wrap you in satin.''

1214
01:32:12,293 --> 01:32:15,456
His careerwill be over
when this is broadcast

1215
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:19,330
''l'll wrap you in
satin.'' Brilliant, Goldie

1216
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,597
lt won't sustain,
ma'am. - You think so?

1217
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:23,998
The casting couch is old hat.

1218
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:26,531
lt won't survive the weekend

1219
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:28,268
Won't survive? But he's lndia's..

1220
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,707
..top pop star

1221
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:31,334
Not good enough

1222
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:32,537
Right.
- Why are you butting in?

1223
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:34,376
One minute, Prabhat

1224
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:38,348
So what if he hit on her?

1225
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,351
What's his image anyway?.

1226
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:42,345
''You're cute when you're naked''

1227
01:32:42,456 --> 01:32:43,753
He sings such songs.

1228
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:45,549
Any sex footage?

1229
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:47,351
No

1230
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,363
Miss Meerut, all over again

1231
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:56,029
Try a double sting.
Pre-denial, post-denial

1232
01:32:56,871 --> 01:32:58,771
This storybreaks. Loki denies it

1233
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:00,773
Denies it? But it's all on camera

1234
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:03,435
He'll say it's fictitious.
She's a lying slut

1235
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:07,311
One more sting and we nail him

1236
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:08,839
Let's go, Naina

1237
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:10,307
One minute

1238
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:12,318
Naina
- One minute

1239
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:15,980
Nail him?

1240
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:17,314
What if he offers you money..

1241
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:18,858
..to buy the footage?

1242
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,928
Brilliant, Goldie.. - Ma'am,
it would be illegal.

1243
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:24,464
One second, Prabhat. Sit down

1244
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:29,327
This is what you do.

1245
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:31,931
We already have this footage

1246
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:35,608
Meet Loki again. On camera

1247
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:40,539
Tell him about this footage.

1248
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:44,910
Make him buy it from you

1249
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,744
That's blackmail

1250
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,446
- He must offer you money on camera

1251
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:52,287
Bring us that footage.
That'll be the sting..

1252
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:53,417
..of the century

1253
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,291
Get it? He's seen buying footage..

1254
01:33:57,398 --> 01:33:59,491
..that he claimed is fictitious

1255
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,959
A perfect scoop. lt'll be great.

1256
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:03,528
How will that help?

1257
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,232
- Talk shows. lnterviews

1258
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,706
Crying. Whining. Apologizing.

1259
01:34:09,276 --> 01:34:10,834
We can stretch it for a season

1260
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:15,647
''See how cute naked
Loki looks'' Not bad.

1261
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:17,245
And then?

1262
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:18,375
- Nothing. That's it

1263
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,578
Call him

1264
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,315
Naina!

1265
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:29,724
l'll film you from the other table.

1266
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,464
The mike's on you

1267
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:32,589
Why didn't you tell them that

1268
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,997
we have the sex footage?

1269
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:39,929
What happened with Miss Meerut?

1270
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:44,341
l pretended to be her client.

1271
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:46,870
She was undressing

1272
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:49,474
My camera jammed

1273
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:52,546
That's what all
the taunts are about

1274
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:54,814
Why do you listen to her?

1275
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:56,547
- Who?

1276
01:34:56,657 --> 01:34:57,817
Your editor. That witch

1277
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:01,752
Because l'm useless

1278
01:35:02,797 --> 01:35:06,733
Useless. You toppled the government

1279
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:08,425
You unravel the truth.

1280
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:09,967
You deserve an award

1281
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:17,978
Sure. My website was shut down

1282
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:22,849
One of my guys went to jail. CBl is
after another one. l was prosecuted

1283
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:23,974
That's the award

1284
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:28,585
But you did it for the country

1285
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:33,250
The country wants..

1286
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,384
..prime time entertainment

1287
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:35,519
Like you

1288
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:41,262
You can't be a rme being close..

1289
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:43,336
..to anyone else, right?

1290
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:51,535
Where is your friend?

1291
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:53,337
Sit down

1292
