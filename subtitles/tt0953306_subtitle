1
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,125
Brother. Brother, stop the bus.

2
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,528
Do you have to go?

3
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,658
No, i want to alight here.

4
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,599
Brother, have you gone mad.

5
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:05,595
If you will alight here,
then you will not...

6
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,866
...get any bus till the morning.

7
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,802
And there is no place to
stay around here too.

8
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,135
You will get a bus only
in the morning.

9
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,145
You don't worry about me.

10
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,205
No, who is worried.

11
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,217
Here, i will stop it.

12
00:08:53,866 --> 00:09:00,931
Allah ho akbar...

13
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:10,773
allah ho akbar...

14
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,066
hey where are you going?

15
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,235
I will just talk to them.

16
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,882
I request you all to
maintain the peace.

17
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:30,683
All of us have been surrounded
by a grave problem.

18
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:35,591
We have to wait for this terrorist.

19
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,960
We have to wait for him to come out.

20
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,523
If we want, then we can
easily break the doors...

21
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,001
...of the temple and barge inside!

22
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,529
But no! We cannot make
this ancient temple...

23
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:53,601
...of ours impure with the
blood of this terrorist!

24
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,203
Clap!

25
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,815
Long live!
- Mother india!

26
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:04,556
And that's why i request you all...

27
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:09,617
...that we all peacefully wait
for this terrorist to come out.

28
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,562
And anyway, we don't know that...

29
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,725
...how many terrorists are
hiding inside the temple.

30
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,826
Long live!
- Mother india!

31
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,905
Long live!
- Mother india!

32
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,304
Say!

33
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,036
Clap!

34
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,569
I will tell you all that what is...

35
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,976
...there in the bag of the terrorist.

36
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,647
There is a drawing book.

37
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,583
In which there are drawings of our...

38
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,643
...famous temples gods and goddesses.

39
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,087
Like meera krishna.

40
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,648
Etcetera, etcetera.

41
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,718
That we have sent to the
laboratory for examining.

42
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,854
Clap!

43
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,892
Keep quiet, keep quiet you all.

44
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,662
We also found a pencil and a rubber.

45
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,865
That i gave to this boy
here as a memento.

46
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,338
Clap! How wonderful!

47
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,937
Some days ago the district
magistrate sir said to me.

48
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,171
He and i used to study
together in school.

49
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,774
And we are good friends too.

50
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,787
And his wife is such a nice woman.

51
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,150
Please excuse me, i am
being a bit emotional.

52
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,626
Forget it. The district
magistrate sir told me...

53
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,631
...about the foreign countries
and powers...

54
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,191
...that are conspiring against us.

55
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,640
That want to destroy the
heritage of our country...

56
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,768
...our ancient temple!

57
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,642
And this terrorist has barged into...

58
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,947
...this temple with this intention.

59
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,650
And i am sure, mehru, meera, krishna...

60
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:50,787
...are all code words of his mission.

61
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:51,921
It is the name of the mission.

62
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,661
Now you would like to know that...

63
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,329
...why did the terrorist
choose this temple.

64
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,670
Then i will tell you,
that the people...

65
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,835
...of dholpur are so fortunate.

66
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:10,678
This temple, thousands of years ago...

67
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,742
...was the dwelling place
of our gods and goddess.

68
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,381
You don't know this, but i knew it.

69
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,318
I was only waiting for
a special occasion.

70
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,191
And today that occasion has come.

71
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:28,700
I have demanded 2 crore
rupees for this temple.

72
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,995
Clap!

73
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,296
So that the honour and pride of
this temple can be returned.

74
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,767
Clap!

75
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:45,941
Brothers! Welcome this brave
boy with a round of applause.

76
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,110
Come on boy, come.

77
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,212
You have done a very
big thing. Come on

78
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,847
clap!

79
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,789
How nice! Very good.

80
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,454
Salute everyone son, come on.

81
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,230
Clap! Yes very good. Salute
everyone son. Clap!

82
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:13,268
This small boy has proved that
we hindus are very patriotic.

83
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:17,748
This small boy, without
caring for his life...

84
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:22,150
...brought the bag and gave it
in dholpur police station.

85
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,746
And informed us about
this fierce terrorist.

86
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,983
Clap!

87
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,821
Well done boy!

88
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,361
Long live!
- Mother india!

89
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,761
Long live!
- Mother india!

90
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,824
Friends, i will soon talk
to president sir.

91
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:42,169
And this boy will get the national
bravery award of this year.

92
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,775
Clap!

93
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:45,901
Sir, your phone is ringing sir.

94
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,313
Move the mike away from your mouth.

95
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,507
Son, come here.

96
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,444
You don't worry.

97
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,986
Hello paltu, please talk to him. Try.

98
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,112
Come, come.

99
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,348
Come here.

100
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,118
Will you tell me one thing?

101
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,183
Osama bin laden, the terrorist
how does he look.

102
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,092
Does he have a beard? Is he tall?

103
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,860
And could he not be osama bin
laden, could he be saddam.

104
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
Saddam has been caught.

105
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,201
These americans are very big liars.

106
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,466
They must have caught a fake saddam.

107
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,804
You say son. Say, say
what you exactly saw.

108
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,866
You scoundrel, are you drunk
early in the morning.

109
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,809
I swear by goddesses saraswati...

110
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,870
...i will kill you if you will
interfere in between.

111
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,142
You do your own work.

112
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,244
You are telling me!

113
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,481
You dare catch my collar!

114
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,047
I'll show you.

115
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,487
I will talk to you later.

116
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,548
I will kill you! I will ruin you!

117
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,354
He hit me first!

118
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,826
I have called reporters from
all over the country...

119
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,164
...and you are fighting like dogs.

120
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,295
Manner less!

121
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,429
I was just doing my job.

122
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,898
What is your name?
- Gopinath.

123
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,238
Your name is gopinath.

124
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,903
When did you wash your face last?

125
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,344
I was just doing my job...

126
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,241
why don't you understand?

127
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,376
Listen to me, listen.

128
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,977
Go home and wash your face.

129
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,852
I have called reporters from
all over the country...

130
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,914
...not to look at your face.

131
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,357
Come on move from here. Move!

132
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,453
I know that the terrorist osama
bin laden is hiding in there.

133
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,521
But they all want to bank on it.

134
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,459
I will break your spectacles.
I will kill you.

135
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,304
Don't be afraid, don't
be afraid you all.

136
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,870
Look we have to find
the terrorist group...

137
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,936
...through this terrorist.

138
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,279
This terrorist will be killed,
that is for sure.

139
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,945
But finding his group
is much more important.

140
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,956
We will find out his group
and eradicate it.

141
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,218
Clap!

142
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,221
Clap.

143
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:47,489
And that is why i request to you
all to maintain the peace.

144
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,468
And not kill this terrorist
inside the temple.

145
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,495
Keep in mind the
purity of the temple.

146
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,906
The temple should not be made impure.

147
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,501
That is all i want to say to you all.

148
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,412
I am leaving right now,
i will return soon.

149
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,313
Thank you, thank you.

150
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,510
Hail india.

151
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,984
Hail india!

152
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,282
National unity party.

153
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,913
I am just leaving, i will return...

154
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,048
...after meeting the magistrate sir.

155
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,183
You just take care
of everything here.

156
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,317
Okay sir.

157
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,419
Clap for the minister, clap loudly.

158
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,288
Long live.
- Revolution!

159
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,492
Yes we are still at s. P sir's house.
We have still not left.

160
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,331
Yes we have sent all the constables.

161
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,692
My strongest child, sonu.

162
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,372
Now, papa has to go dear.

163
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,036
He has to go to work, okay.

164
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:16,054
Look, in a little while mummy
will be perfectly alright.

165
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,990
Then once mummy will be alright...

166
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,292
...then we all will go to
watch a film, together.

167
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,069
Then, when we will go
to see the film then...

168
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,072
we will eat our most favourite film.

169
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,664
You know which one?

170
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,738
Vanilla ice cream.
- Vanilla ice cream.

171
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,206
And then, what will papa get?

173
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:20,214
S. P, do i have to call the
president to get you here.

174
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,185
Will i have to fax him?

175
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,122
The entire world has gathered here.

176
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,282
And what are you doing there?

177
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,127
And listen, bring priest along.

00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,719
Don't waste our time.

00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,125
Discipline is discipline.

Okay.

00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,360
Yes.

182
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,077
Okay dear, if there is anything
then call papa.

183
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,272
Well done, don't be afraid okay.

184
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,663
Papa, please don't leave us.

185
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,362
I feel like crying.

186
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:25,172
Okay tell me one thing,
how do our tears taste.

187
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,845
Taste. Salty.

188
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,453
And how does the sea water taste.

189
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,857
Salty.

190
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:42,189
Then if you will cry then the
entire sea will be empty.

191
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,136
And if the entire sea empties up...

192
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,195
...then all the fishes will die.

193
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,201
And our nimmi will also die.

194
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,877
That's why, don't cry.

195
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,813
My strong child, my strong child.

196
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,416
What is this monkey doing here?

197
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:14,690
Great.

198
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,398
Nimmi, nimmi, nimmi.

199
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:39,189
I cannot find peace without you.

200
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:43,387
I cannot find peace without you.

201
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:51,201
I cannot find peace without you.

202
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,262
I cannot find peace without you.

203
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:09,953
As you are my only hope, i...

204
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,218
...as you are my only hope, i...

205
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,816
...cannot find peace without you.

206
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,569
Sir.

207
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:37,910
Did you find out how
many men are there?

208
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,474
Yes sir, according to us there
are at least 2 terrorists.

209
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,321
What is this crowd?

210
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,721
They are from the rashtriya
ekta party. - Okay.

211
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,656
Whether it is any party.
- Yes sir.

212
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,322
Any party, they should not
come ahead of the bridge.

213
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,455
Yes sir.

214
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,590
Place three people there.

215
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,258
Four here.
- Okay sir. - and two here.

216
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,392
Okay sir.

217
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,527
Fine.

218
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,332
And call priest, he is in the car.
- Yes.

219
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,466
Bring him out.

220
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,838
Come priest sir, come.

221
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,417
Don't try to act too smart.

222
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,950
Do as much has been told to you.

223
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,353
Make them surrender any way.

224
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,360
National unity party!
- Long live!

225
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,868
National unity party!
- Long live!

226
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,930
National unity party!
- Long live!

227
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,633
National unity party!
- Long live!

228
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:07,828
Brother, i live in
the nearby village.

229
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,397
I am the priest in the mosque there.

230
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:20,543
Come near close to me,
my eyesight is weak.

231
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,981
I cannot see you clearly.

232
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,418
I want to see you...

233
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,931
you are just a child.

234
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,425
Son, i want to tell you something.

235
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:44,999
The muslims nearby have hid
themselves inside their houses.

236
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:50,445
And any mistake from you,
can be deadly for them.

237
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,551
I know that they will not
break down the door now.

238
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,952
They will at least wait for the
higher officials to arrive.

239
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,457
But son, they will surely
break down the doors

240
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:12,533
son, please shoot yourself as soon
as they break down the doors.

241
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,000
Don't be caught alive son.

242
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,542
Son, for allah's sake.

243
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:24,743
Don't harm anyone.

244
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,984
You know what will be the result.

245
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,487
They want you to surrender.

246
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,418
But do you know what will
happen when you surrender.

247
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,561
The crowd that is standing
outside here.

248
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,860
They will kill you.

249
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,493
They are all thirsty for your blood.

250
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,439
I don't know son that who are you...

251
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,441
...where have you come from
and what do you want.

252
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,501
But i know that you
will not survive.

253
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,778
People from all over the country
are gathering here.

254
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,147
A very big conspiracy
is being hatched.

255
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:09,850
Son, when these people...

256
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,795
when these people cannot
fight hunger and poverty.

257
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,593
Then they fight us.

258
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,601
So that they forget their
other grave problems.

259
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:24,907
This crowd will forget all their
problems watching you die.

260
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,542
Even though just for a moment.

261
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,917
But they will feel happy
seeing you die.

262
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,678
Even if for a few moments.

263
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:43,786
Son, allah will help you son.

264
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,213
How many men are there?

265
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,577
1.

266
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,647
Take him.

267
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:13,918
Come priest sir.

268
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,287
There is no need to worry sir.

269
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,289
No, minister sir is
just too excited.

270
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,618
Yes.

271
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,559
There is only one terrorist inside...

272
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,961
...and i think that he
is not even armed.

273
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:59,299
No, no... there is no need
for more force sir.

274
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,037
I will inform you if i will need it.

275
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,301
Yes sir, yes.

276
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,701
Okay sir, thank you.

277
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,208
Chaubey.
- Yes sir.

278
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,809
Who informed the media?

279
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,710
Move, move, move.

280
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,114
Hello.

281
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,150
Ms. Anita, come.

282
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,321
Mr. Pandey.
- Yeah, yeah myself.

283
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,326
Thank you, you know why
i called you here.

284
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,829
Here is my card.

285
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,064
This is for you.

286
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,303
This is for office, this for
house and this is personal.

287
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,274
Quite a crowd.
- Sorry.

288
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,837
Quite a big crowd.

289
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,940
Yea, yeah, yeah like
a kumbh carnival.

290
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,678
I created it, all this.

291
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:51,153
Yea, yeah, yeah.

292
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,349
Move back!

293
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,888
Can i speak to the police in charge?
- Sorry.

294
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,758
Chief police.
- Chief police.

295
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,263
Yes, yes.
- Tiwari.

296
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,634
You want to talk to tiwari?
- Yes. - ladies first.

297
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,100
Come, come, come.

298
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,364
Come, come with me.

299
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,372
I know doctor sir, i
know the situation.

300
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,973
But my daughter, for her happiness...

301
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,981
tiwari, what are you doing?
Listen, listen to me.

302
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,243
Please visit once.

303
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,649
Thank you doctor sir.

304
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,777
Listen to me.

305
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,253
Madam has come, talk to her properly.

306
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,216
Madam this is tiwari,
and this is anita-ji.

307
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,661
Who is this man? What is his name?

308
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,721
Which organization does he belong
to? What are his demands?

309
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,857
Have you talked to him?

310
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,659
Look madam, this is a
very delicate matter...

311
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,727
...i won't be able to tell
you much about it.

312
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,103
But all this operation is under you.

313
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,732
What arrangements have you done?

314
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,870
You can see the arrangements.

315
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,005
The police are situated everywhere.

316
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,912
And we are always in contact
with the centre.

317
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,250
And everything is under control.

318
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:01,820
And there is no need to panic at all.

319
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,952
So, is this an official
government statement?

320
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,694
Madam i have told you that i cannot...

321
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,755
...tell you anything more
than that. That's all.

322
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,893
The priest had first met the
terrorist. Isn't that your work?

323
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,768
I mean the police should
have contacted him first.

324
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,830
Did you send the priest
because he is muslim?

325
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,780
Switch off the camera.

326
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:29,150
Madam, now you will teach
the police their duty.

327
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,983
This is the problem of
you channel people.

328
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,046
You always spice up the matter.

329
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,183
But you never tell
the fact to anyone.

330
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,727
If there is no problem,
then you will...

331
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,193
...make the hindus and
the muslims fight.

332
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,460
If you dare switch on the
camera then i will...

333
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,000
it does not matter if you have come
in the beginning or the end.

334
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,400
What matters is what
you are telling.

335
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,435
Keep the camera off.

336
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,104
Chaubey.
- Yes sir.

337
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,369
Switch on the camera.

338
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,802
As you can see the s. P is here...

339
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:54,936
yes sir.

340
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,071
If there is a call from home then...

341
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,205
...tell them that i will call back.

342
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,340
Okay, fine sir.

343
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,747
Where are you going sir?

344
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:05,316
We are relaying from dholpur
exclusively on channel 5 news.

345
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,116
Shoot there.

346
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,822
Shoot only when he does.
- Okay sir.

347
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,363
Take position.

348
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,993
Follow him, follow him.
- Yeah, i am.

349
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,895
Stand here.

350
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,098
Slight.

351
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,404
Close, close closer.

352
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,276
Yeah, i'm trying to.

353
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,506
Getting the right frame?
- Yeah. - zoom it on him.

354
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,018
I am the s. P here tiwari.

355
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,118
Don't be afraid i will not shoot you.

356
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,026
Look... iook both my hands are empty.

357
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:47,922
What is your name?

358
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,857
What difference does my name make?

359
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,870
Being a muslim is enough for you all.

360
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,964
Tell me your name.
- Anwar.

361
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,206
What do you want?

362
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,471
Nothing.

363
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,280
Who else is there with you?

364
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,877
No one.

365
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,284
Then why are you hiding here?

366
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,218
I am not hiding here, i am just...

367
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,387
where have you come from?
- Lucknow.

368
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,525
Where do you want to go?
- I don't know.

369
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,898
Where do you live in lucknow?

370
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,564
What difference does that make?

371
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,170
That sketchbook is yours.

372
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,571
Sketchbook.
- Yes.

373
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,915
You have made those designs.
- Yes.

374
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,349
Why?

375
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,321
Which weapons do you have?

376
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,193
Where have you hidden the rdx?

377
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,193
Which other temples do you
plan to destroy tell me.

378
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,092
I don't know anything.

379
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,868
And if you will try to
break down the door...

380
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,097
...then i will shoot myself.

381
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,163
I will surely shoot myself.

382
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,600
And like your minister sir said.

383
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,935
I will make your temple
impure with my blood.

384
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,471
What do you get from all this?

385
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,315
And what do you think?

386
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,182
How long can you hide here?

387
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,484
Surrender yourself, okay.

388
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:35,539
This meera, krishna, mehru
are they your code words.

389
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,208
Who is the leader of
your organization?

390
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,642
Master pasha.

391
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,646
Who is meera? Who is krishna? Mehru.

392
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,978
Who are all of them master pasha?

393
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,987
Master pasha, who are all of them?

394
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,700
Love.

395
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,709
True love.

396
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:55,280
Love some one anwar, then you
will know the truth of life.

397
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:03,052
Love, that has truth,
sacrifice and trust.

398
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,389
Like... meera's love for krishna.

399
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,058
And krishna's love for meera.

400
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,063
Meera immersed herself
in krishna's love.

401
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,440
And krishna in meera's love.

402
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,237
Wonderful.

403
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,378
When two people unite in love.

404
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:30,486
Or shall we say, that they both
cross all the boundaries.

405
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,719
That is love.

406
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,388
Rest all are love stories anwar.

407
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,091
Heer ranjha, romeo and juliet.

408
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,101
Only love stories.

409
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,767
Love, that's all.

410
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,541
This life is so colorless
without love anwar.

411
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,781
Where did you get lost?

412
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:12,186
Did you love anyone, like
meera loved krishna?

413
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,172
I loved her a lot.

414
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,277
A lot of love.

415
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:34,144
You know, i could not
sleep at nights.

416
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,788
How could anyone sleep with
so much love inside him?

417
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:46,595
It felt as if, my chest
will burst open.

418
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,269
But, after her death
everything changed.

419
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,802
My meera's death made me insane.

420
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,447
Me... do i look mad.

421
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:22,259
Three months, three months
i stayed in the sanatorium.

422
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:28,198
When there is so much
love inside you.

423
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,536
You feel like sharing it.

424
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:35,201
But when there is no one to share...

425
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,372
...it with then one will turn mad.

426
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,549
It is a very unusual
thing anwar, love.

427
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,215
It can even make you mad.

428
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,485
Okay, i am leaving right
now i have to go to work.

429
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,622
Yesterday i posed as a blind...

430
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,223
...person today i will
pose as a cripple.

431
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,896
This is the only thing that
i don't like about you.

432
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,234
You are such a talented actor.

433
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,366
Why don't you join the
theatre again sir?

434
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,834
You are very talented sir.

435
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,687
I was never talented anwar.

436
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,918
Not even today.

437
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,855
It was love that
taught us everything.

438
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,356
I am again in search of love.

439
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,430
If i find it, then i will
become talented again.

440
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,397
Now let me go, we will
meet in the evening.

441
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,211
'Love someone anwar, then you...

442
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,689
...will know the real
meaning of life.'

443
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:59,289
'Like... meera's love for krishna.'

444
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,458
'And krishna's love for meera.'

445
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:07,363
'Meera immersed herself
in krishna's love.'

446
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,970
'And krishna in meera's love.'

447
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,433
I know who you are.

448
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,902
You are meera.

449
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:32,848
Don't leave me. I don't
want to lose you.

450
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,112
There is a lot of love in my heart.

451
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,752
So much love that i feel
that i will go crazy.

452
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:52,800
Don't leave me. Don't leave
me. Don't leave me.

453
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:09,738
Mehru.

454

My allah, my allah,

457
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:41,839
Your eyes.

458
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:58,886
Your eyes are so beautiful...

459
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:07,028
...that i have fallen
in love with it.

460
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:13,668
Please immerse me in it.

461
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,609
I am in love.

Please immerse me in it.

472
00:45:55,185 --> 00:46:02,648
My heart says to me each time.

473
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:10,657
That you are its desire.

474
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:18,664
My lips tell me each time.

475
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:25,614
That i should talk
only about you.

476
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:34,852
Your speech is so beautiful.

477
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:42,627
That whenever i remember it...

478
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:50,128
...it smells like the fragrance
of flowers.

479
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:27,801
I will hide you somewhere.

480
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:38,686
And not even share your
shadow with anyone.

481
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:46,753
I will make a house for somewhere.

482
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:53,167
And only i live with you.

483
00:47:53,237 --> 00:48:02,441
Your tresses are so dense.

484
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:09,708
Whenever i see it, i feel that...

485
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:17,716
...i should live in its shelter.

486
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:20,126
I am in love

487
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,722
my allah, my allah,
my allah, my allah.

488
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:25,461
My allah, my allah,
my allah, my allah.

00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,060

00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:31,130
my allah, my allah,

00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,745
my allah, my allah,

494
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:43,252
My allah, my allah,
my allah, my allah.

495
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,812
My heart said this,

496
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,984
This secret he told me.

497
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:58,263
The heart that has love and
affection, my allah loves him.

498
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:02,032
My heart said this,
my heart said this.

499
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,973
This secret he told me.

500
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:14,246
The heart that has love and
affection, my allah loves him.

501
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,854
Brother. Brother.

502
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,420
Brother, your hindu friend has come.

503
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,521
He even has a name, udit.

504
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,971
Brother udit.
- Greetings anwar.

505
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,443
Come in.
- No, lets go outside somewhere.

506
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,406
Who was that girl?
- Who? My sister suraiya.

507
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,408
I am not talking about suraiya.

508
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,249
I just saw a girl in the balcony.

509
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,412
Our new tenants.

510
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,987
Shall we go?
- Yes come on.

511
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,227
No matter where you see, there
are people everywhere.

512
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,894
And everyday there are
thousands more born.

513
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,302
To live like dogs.

514
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,909
Look 3... 2.

515
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,904
I don't know why are they living?

516
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,147
Eating crap. Living like crap.

517
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,046
Dying like crap.

518
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,918
You take your community
for instance.

519
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,159
Thousands are scattered
here and there.

520
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,992
You live in your houses.

521
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,097
There are many born everyday
and many die everyday.

522
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,444
Thank god, soon enough
i will leave india.

523
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,412
Far from all this crap.

524
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,040
Can i ask you one thing anwar?

525
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,086
Why did you all go to pakistan
during freedom?

526
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,891
The muslims were
told during freedom...

527
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,621
...that whether you go to pakistan
or stay in india.

528
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,954
You will get equal rights.

529
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,624
But that did not happen.

530
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,968
Good one.

531
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:23,209
I still could not understand,
that why did they lie to us?

532
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,279
You are right friend.

533
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,647
They should not have lied.

534
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:37,050
Mummy says, no matter what
you say but don't lie.

535
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:42,590

00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:49,999
By the way the scores are 6-5.

538
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,938
No, no 6-5.

539
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,066

540
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,303

541
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,375

542
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:07,149

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,194
Even i will make a small
taj mahal for my meera.

544
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,368
Look at this, isn't it wonderful.

545
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,098
I will make it.

546
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,703
Before i die.

547
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,479
In the name of my love.

548
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,050
In the name of my meera.

549
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:41,647
And tell me, how is mehru?

550
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:47,657
Fine. Her mother is always asleep
after taking sleeping pills.

551
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:52,061
And mehru hates india.

552
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,226
She wants to go to america.

553
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,269
She thinks that mtv is america.

554
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,068
She considers britney
spears as her idol.

555
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,547
What is so bad in it?

556
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,006
If someone wants to make someone...

557
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,075
...her idol then what
is so bad in it?

558
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:17,023
Look anwar, if you
really love mehru...

559
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:21,757
...then you will have to
respect her thoughts.

560
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,763
By the way, who is britney spears?

561
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,111
Hi.

562
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,454
Hail bhole.

563
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:55,494
She is the one.

564
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,124
She is good.

565
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,724
Go.
- Come.

566
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,063
I will not be able to come.

567
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,570
And in this guise not at all.

568
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,803
It is so that the today's
world cannot recognise god.

569
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,576
They might throw both of us out.

570
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:12,808
Now you go, and buy all the
cassettes of britney aunty.

571
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,146
Okay i will go, i will
just go and come back.

572
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,276
Do come back but.

573
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,411
Listen.

574
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,418
No master pasha.

575
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:25,154
Keep it, look you
don't earn but i do.

576
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,286
Go now.

577
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,463
And yes, don't start dancing here.

578
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,266
I won't, i swear on britney aunty.

579
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,364
Now you are making me swear too.

580
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,840
Hail bhole, go.

581
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:48,241
After 11th of september, america
could not wait anymore.

582
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:56,125
But the attacks that
are happening on us.

583
00:54:56,192 --> 00:55:01,186
What is the government
doing for that?

584
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,198
This is our question.

585
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:07,134
I agree, that we don't
have big buildings...

586
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:10,195
...like the world trade centre
that are in america.

587
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:15,142
But we have temples, shrines,
and pilgrimages.

588
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:20,547
What is the government
doing to protect them?

589
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:27,155
Our party says that,
we are fighting to...

590
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:30,488
...save the hindu tradition.

591
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,286
To save the hindu customs
and traditions.

592
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:36,821
To save the marathi customs
and traditions.

593
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,861
And i call out to the people.

594
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,562
I call out to all the people.

595
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,699
I call out to all
the people of india.

596
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,904
That they help us in this fight.

597
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,907
'Lndia's old customs
and traditions.'

598
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:56,412
'To save the hindu customs
and traditions.'

599
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,516
'That is all i wanted to say.'

600
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,920
Jai hind!

601
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,673
Adil.
- Yes.

602
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:22,337
When i say cut, only then ask
the people to clap. - Okay.

603
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,674
Go, go, go.

604
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,577
Keeps sitting.

605
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,943
Is everything okay, come on.

606
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:30,881
What is this?
- Sir, the shots.

607
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,717
Movies are not made on papers.

608
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,279
You see through the camera.

609
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,949
Tell the crowd to move from there.

610
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,492
Okay sir.
- Tell them to move there.

611
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,618
It looks empty there.

612
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,753
The eyes are like spears.

613
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:40,887
The eyelids are like lances.

614
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,693
These eyebrows are like swords.

615
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:46,964
This is the place where you
will find all the weapons.

616
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,278
Open, open.

617
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:40,345
Open, open.

618
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,688
Take it, take it.

619
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,818
Take it, take it.

620
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:49,991
Breath in the fresh air, the
bungalow is open, open.

621

Really, what happens in it?

638
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:38,900
The boy and girl that
love each other.

639
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:42,411
To entice each other, they
send flowers and cards.

640
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,140
Yes, they entice each other.

641
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,110
Brother, are you getting interested?

642
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,480
Stop the car.

643
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:51,646
Is it?

644
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,484
It is a very interesting festival.

645
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:54,682
Everything so openly.

646
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,156
These americans are very naughty.

647
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,159
Okay go and get a card for me.

648
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,497
And no one should find out that
you are buying it for me.

649
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,935
But i don't know english.

650
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,099
How will i know what is
written on the card.

651
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,499
You are a fool.

652
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:18,513
The card that has a big
heart on it buy that one.

653
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:19,775
There is nothing to it.

654
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,907
I understood what this valentine is.

655
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,042
Go, go, go.

656
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,089

01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:38,899
I don't want to lose you.

715
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:41,440
I don't want to.

716
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,076
Don't go.

717
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,273
I won't be able to live without you.

718
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,776
I will die without you.

719
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,286
Then die.

720
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:05,096
I... i loved you.

721
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:09,202
But i never loved you.

722
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,137
You never loved me.

723
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:21,942
You never loved me.

724
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:28,812
You never loved me.

725
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,123
You did not love me.

726
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,821
You never loved me!

727
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,832
You never loved me!

728
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,033
Disgusting.

729
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,404
You never loved me.

730
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,836
You never loved me.

731
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,372
You never loved me.

732
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,218
You never loved me!

733
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,154
So much...
- what are you saying?

734
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:07,321
Brother has come. Come on.

735
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,957
Brother, bhabhi-ji and
pandey had called.

736
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,796
Call pandey.
- Yes.

737
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:19,533
Yes pandey, tell me.

738
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,809
Some film people have
come from mumbai.

739
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:25,540
And everyone have gone
to see the shooting.

740
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,878
And everything is going
out of control.

741
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,316
And they are saying that they
have your permission.

742
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,877
So what should i do? Everything
is going out of control.

743
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,947
Tell them to pack up everything
and leave for mumbai.

744
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,960
Otherwise we will break the camera
and bring the heroine home.

745
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:42,887
And pandey, what do you
know about valentine day?

746
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:46,401
Valentine day, don't get entrapped
in these things sir.

747
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,903
These are the same people
that spread aids.

748
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,029
Why sir?

749
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,573
What is this happening?

750
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:55,001
A foreign festival is
ruining out customs.

751
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,908
Are you listening to me or not.

752
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,573
Your voice is breaking up,
but i can hear you.

753
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:02,082
Confiscate all the cards.

754
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:05,917
And if you see any boy or girl
together then beat them up.

755
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:08,855
You don't worry sir, i
will send some people.

756
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,916
I will send someone, you don't worry.

757
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,859
And listen pandey, i will meet the...

758
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,590
...chief minister and then come there.

759
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:18,092
There should be a crowd there.

760
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:22,563
Give the journalist
whatever they want.

761
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,936
Do whatever necessary, but
keep the people happy.

762
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,408
Okay sir, you don't worry sir.

763
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,002
Okay sir.
- Okay.

764
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,137
Turn the car.

765
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,950
'But i never loved you.'

766
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:49,958
Then why did you choose
this location?

767
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:53,399
Why are you roaming
around with a mike?

768
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,902
Why don't you try acting in films?

769
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,232
Really i mean it.

770
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:57,897
Thank you very much, but i am...

771
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,339
...really happy with my profession.
- Really.

772
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,473
So why did you choose this location?

773
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:06,106
I have come here for the same
reason you have come here.

774
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,240
No actually i was joking.

775
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:10,410
In my childhood we used to play
a lot here in this temple.

776
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,646
My friend and me.

777
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,914
It was the same at that time to...

778
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,046
...and today also it is just like that.

779
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,613
Nothing has changed.

780
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:20,655
Nowadays most of the films are
copies of hollywood films.

781
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,458
What do you think about that?

782
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:24,659
What did you say your name was?
- Anita.

783
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,299
Anita look, there is nothing
called as originality.

784
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,597
There is only one thing original.

785
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,669
Lord, allah, god.

786
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:37,005
Wow, that's very philosophical.

787
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,947
I was very philosophical
from my childhood.

788
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,073
From my heart.

789
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:45,450
Ok - the industry changed
me a bit, otherwise.

790
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,956
What is the story of your movie?

791
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:53,017
The story is about love, it
conveys a story of love.

792
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,354
A human being's desire is love.

793
01:08:56,432 --> 01:09:00,368
I mean you, me...
i mean whatever love is...

794
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,494
it talks only about love.

795
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:06,098
Everyone needs love in this world.

796
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,501
You rat, leave from here.

797
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:10,977
I am telling you, leave from here.

798
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,104
Who are you?

799
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,239
Shall i tell you, who i am?

800
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,441
Pack up from here.

801
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:17,680
Someone tell him, that
we have permission.

802
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,721
I have all your permissions.

803
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,320
What do you say in english,
say it in this.

804
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:23,551
Come on say.

805
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:29,052
Pack up.
- Yes come on pack up.

806
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:30,655
Come anita-ji, get up.

807
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,058
Come on pack up.

808
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,196
Wait, wait.

809
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,569
Goddess saraswati please bless me.

810
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,738
Take a right, right!

811
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:47,473
Billu, reduce the commotion.

812
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,608
Sorry uncle.

813
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:50,312
Yes tell me.

814
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,445
Write, to eat on time.

815
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:56,088
Aunty i have written
twice to eat on time.

816
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,649
He lives abroad, they don't
have so much time there.

817
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:01,423
He is my son, so what if
he has gone to america.

818
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:02,555
Will he not read my letter?

819
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:03,689
Moti, moti.
- Gopi, just wait.

820
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,166
And not to fall in love with anyone.

821
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,362
It is only waste of money.

822
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:11,399
To take care of his health,
your poor and ill mother.

823
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,237
Your poor and ill mother,
i wrote that.

824
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:16,369
When will this letter reach him?

825
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,537
Isn't it there?

826
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,046
Here i press the button...

827
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:21,207
moti, moti, moti... and
there goes the letter.

828
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,341
Hurry up. Hurry up.

829
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,113
Wait for 2 minutes.

830
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,244
Here is the money.

831
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:27,388
Is it okay?
- Yes, i will send the change later.

832
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,514
Bless you.

833
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:30,250
Gopi.
- Moti.

834
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,061
Are you crazy, how many
times have i told you...

835
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,461
...not to see adult sites
on the computer.

836
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:37,658
Don't you understand?

837
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:38,791
My father had seen it yesterday...

838
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,061
...he had almost killed me.

839
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:41,193
He was about to break the computer.

840
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,534
Brother you will close down my shop.

841
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:44,800
You please forgive me.

842
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:47,706
Brother, i swear i have changed.

843
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,801
I swear on your mother
that i have reformed.

844
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,073
I have found a way to live life.

845
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,741
You are my friend right?
Just do one thing for me.

846
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,615
I have to send an email,
hundred percent urgent.

847
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:01,486
You want to email, to
whom george bush.

848
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:03,822
Hey how do you know?

849
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:10,096
Listen, go there and tell sharma.

850
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,325
Yes dear say?

851
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:16,099
Papa please come back home
soon, i am very scared.

852
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:18,564
No dear no, don't be scared at all.

853
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,835
You are my brave boy.

854
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:25,105
Be with mummy, and if mummy
is in any trouble.

855
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,171
Then call papa.

856
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:31,549
Doctor uncle will come in a while.

857
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,119
Remember the doctor uncle that
had come the last time...

858
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:37,750
...that had cured you so fast
when you had fallen ill.

859
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,856
He will cure mummy also soon, okay.

860
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:45,466
Okay dear, now papa
has to go to work.

861

Don't cry dear, disconnect the phone

862
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,495

- Okay papa.

863
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,631
Okay papa, i will not cry at all.

864
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:53,868
I love you.

865
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,409
I love you to dear.

866
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:02,683
S. P, i am almost going mad here.

867
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:05,812
And you are stuck up with your wife.

868
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,149
And what happened
about the valentine?

869
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,850
My people are doing your work.

870
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:12,591
And you are doing i love
you, i love you here.

871
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,288
Please maintain the discipline.

872
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,226
What happened? Move from
there all of you!

873
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:22,897
Sir, this pandey has
troubled us a lot.

874
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,229
If you say then
should we lock him up?

875
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:35,243
There... there my wife is fighting
for her life and death.

876
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,583
Only my 6-year-old daughter
is there with her.

877
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,679
She has cancer, she can...

878
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:45,653
and i here... am confiscating
valentine day cards.

879
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:51,789
And this terrorist, who knows
if he is a terrorist or not!

880
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,428
Maybe he is a student of
the dholpur university.

881
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,267
And i am watching over his crowd.

882
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,228
So you are not completely sure...

883
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,665
...that he is a terrorist or not.

884
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:35,240
You know, that the elections
are close by.

885
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:40,507
And the people have not seen your
face for the last five years.

886
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,678
Do you think that the
people are fools?

887
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:50,383
No, no cm sir you don't worry at all.

888
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,861
That boy looks like a terrorist.

889
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,560
I talked to the s. P and the priest.

890
01:13:56,633 --> 01:13:58,999
They told me that boy is a terrorist.

891
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:02,634
And who knows, that may
be it is bin laden.

892
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:05,972
Bin laden.

893
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,336
Are you drunk early in the morning?

894
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:18,277
Bin laden, that terrorist could
find only dholpur to hide.

895
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:20,347
What?

896
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:23,291
Try to use your brains.

897
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,884
And listen to me carefully.

898
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:32,560
Now that boy should die.

899
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:36,896
Whether he is a terrorist or not.

900
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:40,307
If not, then catch him and make...

901
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:42,640
...him confess that he is a terrorist.

902
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:48,373
Without hurting anyone's sentiments.

903
01:14:49,385 --> 01:14:52,582
And remember, the police should
not enter the temple.

904
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:55,380
Do you understand what i am saying?

905
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,686
Yes.

906
01:14:58,394 --> 01:14:59,452
If you even make a small mistake...

907
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:01,326
...then the central will
catch my throat.

908
01:15:02,398 --> 01:15:04,832
Because of your foolishness
we all will be punished.

909
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,326
You want to win the election,
don't you?

910
01:15:11,407 --> 01:15:13,932
And that magistrate's wife.

911
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,072
What is her name?

912
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:20,849
Is she the reason
of your foolishness?

913
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,541
What are you saying sir?

914
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:24,484
I don't even know her.

915
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:29,486
Forget about all this love,
and concentrate on your work.

916
01:15:31,494 --> 01:15:35,362
Yes if this terrorist issue...

917
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:39,094
if we will be able to
bank on it properly.

918
01:15:41,104 --> 01:15:42,731
Then victory is surely ours.

919
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:50,370
Otherwise they will
beat you up so badly.

920
01:15:51,447 --> 01:15:52,539
That you will not be able
to recognise yourself.

921
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:56,912
Go from here, get up.

922
01:15:58,621 --> 01:15:59,781
Okay.

923
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:02,787
Bye.
- Okay.

924
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:22,409
Hello.
- Yes kavita-ji.

925
01:16:22,478 --> 01:16:24,105
You did not call since morning.

926
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,738
I was thinking about you.

927
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:27,075
How are you?

928
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,015
Okay, happy valentine day.

929
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:41,520
Then what happened, elder brother?

930
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:43,523
What will happen? The girl refused.

931
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,718
What are you saying?

932
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:45,852
Come on come on.

933
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:46,986
National unity party.
- Hail.

934
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:48,587
Come on, come on, come on.

935
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:49,825
National unity party.
- Hail.

936
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:52,560
National unity party.
- Hail.

937
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:58,798
National unity party.
- Hail.

938
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:06,047
They are going.
- Get tow bottles and come.

939
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,747
National unity party.
- Hail.

940
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:13,854
National unity party.
- Hail.

941
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:18,583
Ladies and gentlemen, a 9 year old...

942
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:21,595
...child whose name bharat...

943
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:25,700
...is lost in this holy
place of the village.

944
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:29,603
He had worn a tri colour shirt.

945
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:33,538
He had come with his
mother and father...

946
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:35,600
...to this holy place of the village.

947
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:38,543
If anyone finds this boy,
then please come...

948
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:42,983
...and report to the lost
and found department.

949
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:44,677
Get rid of the valentine.

950
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,885
You are trying to make
this another america.

951
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:57,961
What are you saying?

952
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:01,762
Get down, get down.

953
01:19:01,838 --> 01:19:02,896
What happened?

954
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,030
Who is this?

955
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:05,165
You are getting us wrong,
she is my sister.

956
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,299
Please, let us go. Let us go.

957
01:19:06,576 --> 01:19:07,634
Catch your ears.

958
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,768
Catch your ears.

959
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:10,574
Aishwarya-ji, even you
catch your ears.

960
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:20,686
Osama bin laden is here.

961
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:21,983
And the people are at the temple.

962
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:30,291
Catch him, catch him.

963
01:19:40,676 --> 01:19:41,734
Come on, come on.

964
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:42,937
Goddess saraswati you are great.

965
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,647
Osama you wait, i am coming.

966
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:51,686
Whoever leaves national unity party.
- He will lose!

967
01:19:51,754 --> 01:19:53,654
Whoever leaves national unity party.
- He will lose!

968
01:19:53,723 --> 01:19:59,684
Whoever leaves national unity party.
- He will lose!

969
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:04,691
Whoever leaves national unity party.
- He will lose!

970
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:06,665
Siddharth what the
hell are you doing?

971
01:20:06,736 --> 01:20:07,862
Why can't you give me a steady shot?

972
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:13,708
What? - He has gone.
We went and sat there.

973
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,035
Give me a minute.

974
01:20:17,713 --> 01:20:19,943
You know what they said? Sit here.

975
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:22,642
After sitting for a while...
- come on.

976
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:23,980
Sure.

977
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:43,730
My heart cannot rest without you...

978
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:47,834
yes tell me, now what else
do you want from me.

979
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,911
Anita i...

980
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:52,878
look i am working.

981
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:55,745
I am busy, don't call me.

982
01:20:55,918 --> 01:20:57,715
In fact don't ever
call me ever again.

983
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,749
Its over between us.

984
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:01,116
Do you understand?

985
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:03,725
I just called to wish you
happy valentines day.

986
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,260
Happy valentines day, my foot!

987
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:09,162
Anita, please don't leave me.

988
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:13,257
Yeah sure, you have a
lot of love inside you.

989
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:17,229
Anita, please don't leave me.

990
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,368
Whoever will leave national
unity party!

991
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:27,780
He will be beaten up fiercely,
fiercely, fiercely.

992
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:36,724
I swear on this tri colour flag,
we will never let it bow.

993
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:40,159
We will never leave our
motherland in despair.

994
01:21:40,296 --> 01:21:44,926
We will give up our lives
for our motherland.

995
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:46,730
Not only on land, we will hoist...

996
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:48,770
...the tri colour flag
even in the sky.

997
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,738
Brothers and sisters, at
these troubled times...

998
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:54,139
...come together and sing along.

999
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:59,044
And take away cold drinks,
cool and sweet.

1000
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:43,857
Beware!

1001
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:56,863
Beware!

1002
01:22:57,006 --> 01:23:01,466
All traitors! Beware!

1003
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:06,281
Brothers, another man
is lost in this crowd.

1004
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:09,873
His name is gopinath.

1005
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:12,487
He is lost in this carnival.

1006
01:23:12,555 --> 01:23:16,423
Wheatish complexion, height
4 feet 5 inches.

1007
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:19,289
And he is a bit insane.

1008
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:24,889
He used to call himself the
reporter of dholpur express.

1009
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:28,401
He was last seen in this carnival.

1010
01:23:28,571 --> 01:23:30,903
If anyone has any information
about him.

1011
01:23:30,973 --> 01:23:34,340
Then come and inform
us at the centre.

1012
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,468
Thank you.

1013
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:49,951
Patriots, love each
other my patriots.

1014
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:58,329
Patriots, love each
other my patriots.

1015
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:20,879
India at its colorful best. There
is actually a singing competition...

1016
01:24:20,956 --> 01:24:24,949
...happening at this
controversial site.

1017
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:28,963
This is suzan, reporting from
dholpur live for club news.

1018
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:33,201
Yes pandey, is everything
going on fine?

1019
01:24:33,335 --> 01:24:37,169
Yes sir, i organised a funfair here.

1020
01:24:37,973 --> 01:24:39,235
Keep the people happy.

1021
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,933
They should not be bored
for even a minute.

1022
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:43,443
No one will be bored at all sir.

1023
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:47,506
Listen, a team is
arriving from delhi.

1024
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,447
They have to do some investigation.

1025
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:51,247
Take care of them too.

1026
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,980
They are from delhi, there
should not be any problem.

1027
01:24:54,123 --> 01:24:56,990
Even if they come from america,
i will handle them sir.

1028
01:24:57,059 --> 01:24:58,253
Don't you have faith on me, sir?

1029
01:24:58,461 --> 01:25:01,089
Do you understand what i am saying?
- Absolutely.

1030
01:25:01,197 --> 01:25:02,323
And you will not drink alcohol.

1031
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,192
If you will drink even a drop,
then i will shoot you.

1032
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:07,131
What are you saying sir?

1033
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,327
Today is saturday, i don't even...

1034
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:10,133
...think about alcohol on saturdays.

1035
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,967
Don't you have faith on me, sir?

1036
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:13,336
Sorry sir, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1037
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:16,001
Okay i am arriving at the temple...
i am on my way.

1038
01:25:16,145 --> 01:25:17,442
Yes sir.
- You don't move from there.

1039
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:19,207
Remember what i explained to you.
- Yes sir.

1040
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,339
Okay sir.

1041
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:21,474
If there is any problem
then call me. - Okay.

1042
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:22,608
Okay i am disconnecting now.

1043
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:24,076
Sorry brother.

1044
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:25,211
Concentrate on this side.

1045
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,345
What are you doing?

1046
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:27,480
But sir, you spat there.

1047
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:34,018
I told you not to touch it.

1048
01:25:35,064 --> 01:25:37,191
I told you not to touch it. No.

1049
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:40,461
I told you not to touch it. No.

1050
01:25:53,215 --> 01:25:54,273
Good looking.

1051
01:26:00,055 --> 01:26:04,253
You should have told me earlier.
I thought just like that...

1052
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,494
am i the most ugly looking
person in the world?

1053
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,394
Why do girls keep away from me?

1054
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:23,177
Yes, i... have put on some weight,
so i will start jogging.

1055
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:25,304
I will start it from tomorrow.

1056
01:26:26,549 --> 01:26:28,244
I will get up early from tomorrow.

1057
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,077
And then no more spots
below the eyes.

1058
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:35,414
There is no problem
about the stomach.

1059
01:26:35,558 --> 01:26:39,619
It will go, it will go, time
it will go, it will go.

1060
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:49,403
The thing is that i am a very
nice person from the heart.

1061
01:26:50,105 --> 01:26:55,566
My friend says that
you have a illness.

1062
01:26:57,146 --> 01:27:00,115
You fall in love with
any girl you see.

1063
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:02,717
So what shall i do? I only love her.

1064
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:05,276
If i do love her, then i do love her.

1065
01:27:24,936 --> 01:27:31,705
You are crying?
Any problem? Tell me.

1066
01:27:33,945 --> 01:27:35,503
Are you well?

1067
01:27:37,115 --> 01:27:41,518
Yes. I am fine.

1068
01:27:49,527 --> 01:27:50,789
Pandey.

1069
01:27:50,962 --> 01:27:54,022
Sir, i was just going to
call you. What telepathy!

1070
01:27:54,132 --> 01:27:57,829
I am... not feeling well.

1071
01:27:57,969 --> 01:28:00,995
Sir, what happened?
Sir, its very hot.

1072
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:04,768
Look, you have lime juice. Sir,
by what time you will be back?

1073
01:28:05,977 --> 01:28:09,140
I will see when i come. Take care
of the people from delhi.

1074
01:28:09,213 --> 01:28:11,738
Sir, you don't worry. Sir, take care.

1075
01:28:11,883 --> 01:28:14,078
Sir, take care. I will
call you. Okay, sir.

1076
01:28:14,218 --> 01:28:16,948
Fine. Fine.

1077
01:28:20,758 --> 01:28:25,559
'Then die! But i never loved you.'

1078
01:28:30,835 --> 01:28:33,565
Hail india!

1079
01:28:39,577 --> 01:28:43,104
Indians are the best!
Indians are the best!

1080
01:28:46,584 --> 01:28:48,609
Hail india!

1081
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:55,751
Indians are the best!

1082
01:29:17,615 --> 01:29:18,707
He will make me mad!

1083
01:29:20,051 --> 01:29:22,076
Anita, what the hell is going on!

1084
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,551
Lts been 2 hours since we have...

1085
01:29:23,621 --> 01:29:25,145
...received any footage from you.

1086
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:28,588
But nothing is happening here.

1087
01:29:28,893 --> 01:29:30,952
Ringing competition is going on.

1088
01:29:31,062 --> 01:29:32,996
So people are singing
patriotic songs.

1089
01:29:33,131 --> 01:29:35,156
Now do you want me to cut into that?

1090
01:29:35,233 --> 01:29:36,632
I don't particularly care.

1091
01:29:36,734 --> 01:29:38,759
Just try and get an interview
of the terrorist guy.

1092
01:29:38,903 --> 01:29:40,564
Yeah. But frankly speaking
i don't think...

1093
01:29:40,638 --> 01:29:42,799
...anybody is inside the temple.

1094
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:45,272
I think these people of
dholpur are insane.

1095
01:29:45,643 --> 01:29:47,838
I have not yet met a
man who is not drunk.

1096
01:29:47,979 --> 01:29:49,037
Please keep your voice down.

1097
01:29:49,313 --> 01:29:51,144
You are not in delhi anymore,
you know.

1098
01:29:51,249 --> 01:29:53,649
Nobody is listening. Nobody
is listening to me.

1099
01:29:53,918 --> 01:29:58,821
Okay, listen. Try and get an
interview of the terrorist. Okay.

1100
01:29:58,956 --> 01:30:04,155
Try and make some contact
with him. All right. Anita!

1101
01:30:04,262 --> 01:30:06,662
Okay. I will get back to you.

1102
01:30:12,937 --> 01:30:15,667
Forget about the past.

1103
01:30:15,807 --> 01:30:18,970
The past is no more.

1104
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:21,872
I don't know who made you the
creative head of the channel.

1105
01:30:22,947 --> 01:30:24,005
Sure.

1106
01:30:26,884 --> 01:30:30,752
Now you fall in love with some
girl's finger. It happens.

1107
01:30:31,956 --> 01:30:37,053
You fall... in love with
some girl's hair.

1108
01:30:37,195 --> 01:30:39,322
You fall in love with her face mole.

1109
01:30:39,697 --> 01:30:41,961
With eyes... it happens.

1110
01:30:42,133 --> 01:30:46,297
I mean you can fall in
love with anything.

1111
01:30:46,704 --> 01:30:48,672
What to do? You just fall in love.

1112
01:30:48,806 --> 01:30:50,740
Its only love. It's nothing wrong.

1113
01:30:50,975 --> 01:30:53,307
Once. Just once.

1114
01:30:54,979 --> 01:31:01,145
Some girl... should say
to me... just for me...

1115
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:07,715
...for my happiness that i love you.

1116
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:13,927
That's it. That's it. The end.

1117
01:31:14,065 --> 01:31:15,123
Move!

1118
01:31:17,168 --> 01:31:21,730
Anita-ji. You look very
tense. Any problem?

1119
01:31:24,742 --> 01:31:25,800
Anita-ji.

1120
01:31:26,744 --> 01:31:28,712
I want an interview
with the terrorist.

1121
01:31:45,196 --> 01:31:49,132
I can do anything for you.
Seriously. Yeah. Come.

1122
01:31:49,267 --> 01:31:51,064
We will talk to him.
We will talk to him.

1123
01:31:54,872 --> 01:31:57,841
Tiwari! Tiwari, i am talking
to you. Tiwari!

1124
01:31:58,042 --> 01:31:59,703
Ma'am wants an interview
with the terrorist.

1125
01:31:59,777 --> 01:32:01,745
So make the arrangement.

1126
01:32:03,214 --> 01:32:04,943
I am not your father's servant!

1127
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,717
I will pump so many bullets
in your skull...

1128
01:32:07,785 --> 01:32:11,312
...that even your mother won't
be able to recognise your face!

1129
01:32:11,389 --> 01:32:12,754
Understood! Move!

1130
01:32:14,225 --> 01:32:17,126
Have you gone mad? Tiwari,
have you gone made?

1131
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:19,287
Ma'am, he has gone mad.

1132
01:32:19,797 --> 01:32:21,765
You wait here. I will make
some arrangement for you.

1133
01:32:22,066 --> 01:32:23,727
I will get you transferred
to kala handi.

1134
01:32:23,801 --> 01:32:25,826
You have lost your senses. Idiot,
you hit me on my lips!

1135
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:28,800
And i will clean my house
with your uniform!

1136
01:32:28,873 --> 01:32:31,171
Listen to me, tiwari!
You don't know me.

1137
01:32:31,809 --> 01:32:33,777
Where is my phone! Give my phone.

1138
01:32:34,278 --> 01:32:40,183
My... my wife... is breathing her last.

1139
01:32:40,818 --> 01:32:42,843
Zoom! Zoom on him!

1140
01:32:45,423 --> 01:32:47,823
How can i live without her?

1141
01:32:50,094 --> 01:32:52,824
My child called me just now.

1142
01:32:55,933 --> 01:32:58,902
Only half an hour or
one hour, that's it.

1143
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:07,841
Ma'am... so what if i
am a police officer.

1144
01:33:09,113 --> 01:33:11,377
My heart is filled with love.

1145
01:33:14,318 --> 01:33:18,414
I loved only once in my
life. With my wife.

1146
01:33:18,489 --> 01:33:22,323
And she is dying. And i can't go.

1147
01:33:25,296 --> 01:33:26,786
And this... terrorist anwar...

1148
01:33:26,864 --> 01:33:29,799
...till the time he
doesn't surrender...

1149
01:33:29,867 --> 01:33:33,268
...i won't be able to go.

1150
01:33:34,305 --> 01:33:37,399
He is not a terrorist! I know it!

1151
01:33:37,942 --> 01:33:40,103
I don't know why he is hiding here.

1152
01:33:42,313 --> 01:33:44,247
And these idiots...

1153
01:33:52,156 --> 01:33:59,892
my wife is dying and... and i
can't go to meet my beloved.

1154
01:34:07,071 --> 01:34:08,333
Don't shoot.

1155
01:34:21,118 --> 01:34:23,086
Anita... what...

1156
01:34:51,215 --> 01:34:55,948
mehru.

1157
01:34:58,956 --> 01:35:00,116
Anwar.

1158
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,052
Anwar.

1159
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:10,225
Anwar.

1160
01:35:13,971 --> 01:35:15,029
Anwar.

1161
01:35:19,176 --> 01:35:22,009
I know... you are not a terrorist.

1162
01:35:24,415 --> 01:35:27,077
By the way i am anita.

1163
01:35:28,052 --> 01:35:30,987
My heart says that you
are not a terrorist.

1164
01:35:31,255 --> 01:35:32,313
Then these people...

1165
01:35:34,425 --> 01:35:37,917
me and a terrorist?
Please explain to...

1166
01:35:37,995 --> 01:35:40,623
...them that i am not a terrorist.

1167
01:35:41,265 --> 01:35:46,362
And i didn't kill anybody.
Please tell them.

1168
01:35:47,004 --> 01:35:48,062
Will you tell them?

1169
01:35:49,173 --> 01:35:52,267
I will tell them that you
are not a terrorist.

1170
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:56,008
But you will have to surrender.

1171
01:35:56,447 --> 01:35:58,244
I promise you that nothing
will happen to you.

1172
01:35:58,616 --> 01:36:00,140
I will help you.

1173
01:36:01,485 --> 01:36:04,010
Mehru must have sent you.

1174
01:36:05,289 --> 01:36:06,347
Mehru?

1175
01:36:07,224 --> 01:36:10,091
No? Then...

1176
01:36:14,365 --> 01:36:18,961
if you met mehru in this
crowd then tell her...

1177
01:36:19,036 --> 01:36:22,199
...that i didn't kill her.

1178
01:36:23,307 --> 01:36:29,644
I didn't kill her. I love her.
I love her immensely.

1179
01:36:32,483 --> 01:36:35,043
I am waiting here for mehru.

1180
01:36:37,655 --> 01:36:41,523
If she can't come to meet
me here, then fine.

1181
01:36:42,526 --> 01:36:45,051
I will go to meet her
in her new house.

1182
01:36:45,529 --> 01:36:48,054
Mehru? Who is mehru?

1183
01:36:49,233 --> 01:36:51,599
If you want i will talk to
her and bring her here.

1184
01:36:52,403 --> 01:36:55,099
Anwar, are you listening to me?

1185
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,332
Anwar!

1186
01:37:01,512 --> 01:37:06,074
You don't know mehru?
You don't know mehru.

1187
01:37:07,251 --> 01:37:09,048
You don't know mehru.

1188
01:37:10,554 --> 01:37:12,078
You don't know mehru.

1189
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:15,417
Mehru.

1190
01:37:29,106 --> 01:37:30,164
Mehru.
- Yes.

1191
01:37:30,374 --> 01:37:33,036
Even if i worked round
the clock all my life...

1192
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:35,510
...still i can't take you to america.

1193
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:39,105
As it is america is a
city of destruction.

1194
01:37:39,383 --> 01:37:41,613
There they always drop bomb.

1195
01:37:43,187 --> 01:37:47,123
And your britney spears...
i think she is mad.

1196
01:37:47,258 --> 01:37:51,126
You are much more talented than
her. And much prettier.

1197
01:37:52,396 --> 01:37:56,127
Look, anwar. Don't mind.

1198
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,495
But your thinking is
very narrow-minded.

1199
01:37:58,669 --> 01:38:02,366
And america... it is the dream
country of millions of people.

1200
01:38:03,574 --> 01:38:05,064
Only when you venture out
of lucknow will you...

1201
01:38:05,142 --> 01:38:08,134
...come to know how much
the world has progressed.

1202
01:38:09,346 --> 01:38:12,474
And anwar, i hate this country.

1203
01:38:12,616 --> 01:38:16,643
Everywhere there is dust, dirt,
filth, people, heat.

1204
01:38:18,155 --> 01:38:20,146
You have to venture out of your
house in a frightened state.

1205
01:38:20,291 --> 01:38:22,418
I don't want to live
in this country.

1206
01:38:23,427 --> 01:38:25,190
But i love you, mehru.

1207
01:38:26,597 --> 01:38:31,500
Anwar, love is fine. But
love doesn't make life.

1208
01:38:31,635 --> 01:38:35,594
Your research on temples is futile.

1209
01:38:35,773 --> 01:38:37,502
You have to be practical in life.

1210
01:38:37,641 --> 01:38:41,168
Your friend... what's his name... udit.

1211
01:38:41,312 --> 01:38:44,179
Look at udit. He has done
computer engineering.

1212
01:38:44,248 --> 01:38:45,340
And he has got a job in america.

1213
01:38:45,482 --> 01:38:47,416
Now you should be like him.

1214
01:38:47,618 --> 01:38:51,110
And people with whom you socialize
like master pasha...

1215
01:38:51,188 --> 01:38:52,621
...they are useless.

1216
01:38:53,223 --> 01:38:57,182
Even they couldn't achieve anything.
They are just losers.

1217
01:38:57,461 --> 01:39:00,362
Losers? Losers mean what?

1218
01:39:00,497 --> 01:39:04,263
Anwar, look. You should not feel bad.

1219
01:39:04,635 --> 01:39:07,502
But i only wish you well. And...

1220
01:39:08,806 --> 01:39:12,207
anwar, we should move from here.
These constables are mad.

1221
01:39:12,343 --> 01:39:14,811
Let them come. We won't go.
- What!

1222
01:39:14,878 --> 01:39:16,743
I want to talk to you.
- Don't act childishly.

1223
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,575
Hey! Hey! Lovers! Get up! Get up!

1224
01:39:18,716 --> 01:39:20,183
I will talk to them.

1225
01:39:20,484 --> 01:39:22,384
What are you both doing here alone?

1226
01:39:22,453 --> 01:39:23,511
And why have you held her hands?

1227
01:39:23,654 --> 01:39:25,349
Forgive us. We will leave right now.

1228
01:39:25,422 --> 01:39:26,480
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1229
01:39:26,623 --> 01:39:29,217
And what is in your pocket?
What is in your pocket?

1230
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,418
Condom.

1231
01:39:31,495 --> 01:39:33,190
Look, mind your language.

1232
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:36,231
I see! So you will teach me manners!
You will teach me manners!

1233
01:39:36,367 --> 01:39:39,234
Come on! Hold your ears! Hold
your ears and do sit ups.

1234
01:39:39,503 --> 01:39:42,233
And you... aren't you a muslim lady?

1235
01:39:42,373 --> 01:39:44,204
Why didn't you wear 'burkha'?

1236
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:45,399
You are roaming around like a heroine.

1237
01:39:45,509 --> 01:39:46,567
You won't find customers.

1238
01:39:47,244 --> 01:39:48,302
Anwar!

1239
01:39:48,679 --> 01:39:50,203
You dare to raise your hands
on a police officer!

1240
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,338
Anwar!

1241
01:39:51,482 --> 01:39:53,177
You dare to raise your hands
on a police officer!

1242
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,308
No, anwar!

1243
01:39:54,451 --> 01:39:56,180
Call somebody from the
police station! Go!

1244
01:39:56,253 --> 01:39:58,221
He is mad! He is mad!

1245
01:39:58,355 --> 01:40:00,220
Anwar, please leave him!

1246
01:40:01,692 --> 01:40:04,252
Anwar! Anwar, give me your hand!

1247
01:40:05,429 --> 01:40:06,487
Give me your hand!

1248
01:40:06,563 --> 01:40:07,621
No!

1249
01:40:08,265 --> 01:40:09,323
Anwar!

1250
01:40:12,436 --> 01:40:13,528
Let's go.

1251
01:40:27,451 --> 01:40:29,248
I hate this country.

1252
01:41:07,424 --> 01:41:08,482
Love.

1253
01:41:09,526 --> 01:41:11,391
Master pasha, you are here.

1254
01:41:11,595 --> 01:41:12,653
Since when i was searching for you.

1255
01:41:12,729 --> 01:41:13,787
Come, anwar.

1256
01:41:14,431 --> 01:41:16,422
What has happened to you?

1257
01:41:16,667 --> 01:41:19,261
Lts nothing. The lane which
i visited as a leper...

1258
01:41:19,336 --> 01:41:22,328
...i went there as a blind man.

1259
01:41:22,606 --> 01:41:23,664
So people bashed me up.

1260
01:41:24,775 --> 01:41:26,743
I wanted to talk to you urgently.

1261
01:41:28,345 --> 01:41:29,403
I have fallen in love.

1262
01:41:29,613 --> 01:41:30,773
Love.

1263
01:41:31,548 --> 01:41:34,346
Yes. We will talk about
the rest at home.

1264
01:41:34,485 --> 01:41:36,316
You quickly turn around the cycle.

1265
01:41:36,453 --> 01:41:37,613
We can't say anything
about the public.

1266
01:41:37,688 --> 01:41:39,383
They thrashed me black and blue.

1267
01:41:39,623 --> 01:41:41,557
Let's go quickly.

1268
01:41:46,797 --> 01:41:50,028
When i thought.

1269
01:41:50,834 --> 01:41:56,568
My eyes brimmed with tears.

1270
01:41:56,707 --> 01:42:00,370
When i thought.

1271
01:42:09,586 --> 01:42:15,752
Dipti... it took you
1 year to find me.

1272
01:42:17,427 --> 01:42:22,330
You say that... i am the only
one in the entire india...

1273
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:24,924
...who can build such a temple set.

1274
01:42:29,606 --> 01:42:33,406
Anwar... she searched for
me for an entire year.

1275
01:42:33,677 --> 01:42:37,636
You have told me this 99 times
in the past one-hour.

1276
01:42:38,448 --> 01:42:40,916
Say it once more and you will
complete the century.

1277
01:42:41,885 --> 01:42:45,412
You don't understand.

1278
01:42:48,592 --> 01:42:51,425
Are you sure that she too...

1279
01:42:58,435 --> 01:43:00,903
there is so much love
in her eyes, anwar.

1280
01:43:03,707 --> 01:43:08,644
The way she looks at me... smiles...

1281
01:43:11,014 --> 01:43:16,008
...i am sure... that she loves me.

1282
01:43:24,895 --> 01:43:27,523
You don't tell her about this injury.

1283
01:43:29,666 --> 01:43:32,829
Clean this place. She
is about to come.

1284
01:43:32,903 --> 01:43:34,393
Where have you removed your slippers?

1285
01:43:34,471 --> 01:43:35,529
You don't understand at all.

1286
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:39,470
Clean this. Remove this from here.

1287
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:40,668
Remove this slipper from here.

1288
01:43:41,678 --> 01:43:43,703
What are you doing?
You don't understand.

1289
01:43:44,581 --> 01:43:45,639
Remove the liquor bottles from here.

1290
01:43:46,483 --> 01:43:49,919
You see, girls prefer things
kept neatly and tidily.

1291
01:43:50,487 --> 01:43:52,955
Otherwise what happens is that...

1292
01:43:53,023 --> 01:43:54,752
yes. How are you? Greetings.

1293
01:43:54,825 --> 01:43:55,883
Dipti.

1294
01:43:56,493 --> 01:43:59,690
You... please sit. Come.

1295
01:44:01,698 --> 01:44:03,495
He is anwar, my friend.
- Okay.

1296
01:44:03,567 --> 01:44:04,625
Hi.

1297
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:05,759
He is doing his hindi honours.

1298
01:44:05,936 --> 01:44:07,494
And he is researching
on temples. Dipti-ji.

1299
01:44:07,638 --> 01:44:08,764
Anwar.
- Yes.

1300
01:44:08,905 --> 01:44:10,930
And he is doing research on temples.
- Yes.

1301
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:12,099
Very interesting.

1302
01:44:13,777 --> 01:44:15,870
What happened to you?
- He fell down.

1303
01:44:16,947 --> 01:44:18,471
He fell on the street.

1304
01:44:18,615 --> 01:44:20,879
You know the plight of lucknow
streets, don't you?

1305
01:44:20,951 --> 01:44:22,009
What are you doing?

1306
01:44:22,085 --> 01:44:23,484
Are you badly hurt?
- No. Its nothing.

1307
01:44:24,554 --> 01:44:27,523
I have got a copy of the play
i told you about. - Okay.

1308
01:44:28,592 --> 01:44:30,958
There are 3 characters.
3 characters.

1309
01:44:31,061 --> 01:44:33,621
But only one actor will play
all the 3 characters.

1310
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:35,493
This is what i have thought
about the play. - Okay.

1311
01:44:36,867 --> 01:44:38,892
But the main part about
the play is its set.

1312
01:44:39,069 --> 01:44:42,596
And i am sure that only
you can make the set.

1313
01:44:46,977 --> 01:44:50,105
I have got some papers...
and some pencil too.

1314
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:53,515
'Dipti... there is so much
love in your eyes.'

1315
01:44:54,217 --> 01:44:57,482
'I feel that you should
go on saying something...

1316
01:44:57,554 --> 01:45:01,820
...and i should go on
listening to you.'

1317
01:45:02,592 --> 01:45:05,789
By the way there are other
things about the play too.

1318
01:45:05,996 --> 01:45:07,054
'I should go on looking at you.'

1319
01:45:07,164 --> 01:45:08,597
But maybe it's enough for today.

1320
01:45:08,665 --> 01:45:09,825
I will leave now, sir.

1321
01:45:11,568 --> 01:45:12,626
No, no.

1322
01:45:12,769 --> 01:45:15,567
You... you... at least have tea.
- I will make tea.

1323
01:45:15,706 --> 01:45:17,731
Go and get the tea from
the confectioner shop.

1324
01:45:18,008 --> 01:45:19,066
I will get it but...

1325
01:45:19,176 --> 01:45:21,508
no, sir. Not today... - bring snacks
from the confectioner shop.

1326
01:45:21,578 --> 01:45:24,843
No, sir. I will have it the
next time i come. - Listen...

1327
01:45:24,981 --> 01:45:26,505
everybody is waiting for
me for the rehearsals.

1328
01:45:26,583 --> 01:45:27,641
I will get it but...

1329
01:45:27,718 --> 01:45:28,844
i can't wait today.

1330
01:45:34,925 --> 01:45:37,689
Take care. I will leave now. Goodbye.

1331
01:45:41,031 --> 01:45:42,623
She didn't even have tea.

1332
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:51,598
Anwar... how do we look together?

1333
01:45:52,876 --> 01:45:57,904
Good. But i think you both should
spend some time together.

1334
01:45:58,782 --> 01:46:00,579
To know each other better.

1335
01:46:01,985 --> 01:46:04,613
Maybe she just likes your work.

1336
01:46:12,229 --> 01:46:14,629
But i love her.

1337
01:46:18,068 --> 01:46:19,865
And that is sufficient for me.

1338
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:28,634
To love somebody... is
a great thing, anwar.

1339
01:46:31,915 --> 01:46:39,014
Do you know... countless people in
the world die without loving.

1340
01:46:41,658 --> 01:46:45,594
One moment spent in love...
is much more than...

1341
01:46:45,662 --> 01:46:48,790
...a life spanning across
thousands of years.

1342
01:46:52,936 --> 01:46:54,597
You think that i am making a...

1343
01:46:54,671 --> 01:46:56,639
...mockery of myself
by falling in love.

1344
01:46:58,842 --> 01:47:02,209
Then i would like to remain
a fool forever.

1345
01:47:05,115 --> 01:47:07,982
Foolish... and mad.

1346
01:47:10,887 --> 01:47:12,115
Mad and foolish.

1347
01:47:17,894 --> 01:47:22,922
I don't know why.

1348
01:47:24,701 --> 01:47:34,736
One moment didn't pass
the whole night.

1349
01:47:36,313 --> 01:47:39,680
One moment didn't pass...

1350
01:47:49,726 --> 01:47:54,720
brother! Brother! Your hindu...
udit has come.

1351
01:48:08,745 --> 01:48:09,803
Feeling nice?

1352
01:48:10,013 --> 01:48:12,880
Yes. Dear, on my knees.

1353
01:48:26,763 --> 01:48:27,821
He is not outside.

1354
01:48:28,765 --> 01:48:30,858
I saw him outside.

1355
01:48:31,234 --> 01:48:34,761
I thought he is coming to meet
you. So i informed you.

1356
01:48:36,373 --> 01:48:37,931
Are you sure he was udit, suraiyya?

1357
01:48:38,775 --> 01:48:40,743
Yes, brother. He was udit.

1358
01:48:40,877 --> 01:48:43,107
If it was his ghost, then
it is a different matter.

1359
01:48:48,118 --> 01:48:49,847
Suraiyya.
- Yes, mother.

1360
01:48:49,986 --> 01:48:51,817
I am feeling a bit worried.

1361
01:48:51,955 --> 01:48:55,789
Mother, you don't worry. You
will get well by this week.

1362
01:48:55,892 --> 01:48:57,723
The medicine that mehru's uncle
has send from kakori...

1363
01:48:57,794 --> 01:48:59,762
...that is really good, mother.

1364
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:16,808
What are you doing? Are you mad?
- Its nothing.

1365
01:49:17,247 --> 01:49:18,771
What if mother wakes up?

1366
01:49:18,915 --> 01:49:20,849
Actually i was searching
for something.

1367
01:49:21,084 --> 01:49:24,144
I am sorry. I am fine.

1368
01:50:31,254 --> 01:50:32,915
Where are you nowadays?

1369
01:50:36,326 --> 01:50:39,523
I am making arrangement for us.

1370
01:50:39,896 --> 01:50:40,988
Paperwork and the rest.

1371
01:50:41,331 --> 01:50:44,960
And these american embassy
people are fools.

1372
01:50:45,902 --> 01:50:47,836
If they had a fight with
their wife at night...

1373
01:50:47,904 --> 01:50:48,996
...then the next day
the visa is rejected.

1374
01:50:49,339 --> 01:50:52,900
I got my visa. And i am out of here.

1375
01:51:05,388 --> 01:51:06,446
4 people were in front of me.

1376
01:51:07,924 --> 01:51:09,892
Just seeing them, they
rejected their visa.

1377
01:51:12,362 --> 01:51:13,522
They were khans.

1378
01:51:15,365 --> 01:51:16,423
Tell me one thing, anwar.

1379
01:51:17,934 --> 01:51:20,459
Why do you guys want to look
different from the rest?

1380
01:51:22,372 --> 01:51:23,862
Darwin has said that separating...

1381
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:26,932
...from your species is the
beginning of an end.

1382
01:51:27,377 --> 01:51:28,969
Darwin was not a muslim.

1383
01:51:29,946 --> 01:51:32,176
And that too in an independent
country like ours.

1384
01:51:33,283 --> 01:51:34,978
If he had been, he would
have understood.

1385
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:37,951
As to why a 15 years old boy
is taught to make a bomb.

1386
01:51:38,621 --> 01:51:41,886
And why he is taught to
start hating the world...

1387
01:51:41,958 --> 01:51:44,950
...before the world
starts hating him.

1388
01:51:47,564 --> 01:51:49,896
After september 11, muslims
all over the world...

1389
01:51:49,966 --> 01:51:52,992
...are been considered as terrorists.

1390
01:51:56,072 --> 01:51:59,041
By the way, i can go
on and on and on.

1391
01:52:03,246 --> 01:52:05,180
Had you come to my house
day before yesterday?

1392
01:52:07,417 --> 01:52:09,977
Day before yesterday? No.

1393
01:52:20,597 --> 01:52:23,566
4-3. last time's score. Come.

1394
01:52:26,603 --> 01:52:28,195
How long will you lose from me?

1395
01:52:28,338 --> 01:52:30,169
At least win once before
i leave for america.

1396
01:52:30,306 --> 01:52:34,003
Yes. Look.
- Good shot.

1397
01:52:59,702 --> 01:53:02,432
Look, i know that you are very busy.

1398
01:53:02,572 --> 01:53:05,040
So i won't take much time.

1399
01:53:06,242 --> 01:53:08,073
I want to say something.

1400
01:53:08,311 --> 01:53:10,973
But many times you want
to say something...

1401
01:53:11,047 --> 01:53:13,982
...but in haste you don't say
what you want to say...

1402
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:17,076
...and you end up saying all
that you didn't want to say.

1403
01:53:25,495 --> 01:53:27,019
I love you.

1404
01:54:21,284 --> 01:54:25,482
I am not a beggar!

1405
01:54:26,556 --> 01:54:30,390
I am an artist!

1406
01:54:30,526 --> 01:54:32,050
At times i am blind,
at times crippled...

1407
01:54:32,128 --> 01:54:34,096
...at times dumb and at times deaf.

1408
01:54:35,231 --> 01:54:38,132
The whole world trusts me!

1409
01:54:38,268 --> 01:54:41,169
The whole world is my stage!

1410
01:54:48,144 --> 01:54:51,170
Only you didn't trust me.

1411
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:57,613
Why do you think that
i am just a beggar?

1412
01:54:59,322 --> 01:55:00,584
A mad beggar.

1413
01:55:05,428 --> 01:55:06,486
Anwar.

1414
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:15,162
Dipti said that... i
am mentally crippled.

1415
01:55:16,606 --> 01:55:19,200
You... what do you think?

1416
01:55:21,644 --> 01:55:26,445
I don't want to trouble you.

1417
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:31,114
These are some temple sketches...

1418
01:55:31,187 --> 01:55:34,281
...that i had drawn for dipti.

1419
01:55:36,259 --> 01:55:39,387
Maybe... you will meet her.

1420
01:55:41,197 --> 01:55:42,630
If you get the chance
then give it to her.

1421
01:55:46,469 --> 01:55:51,702
I want to stay alone for
a while, anwar. Please.

1422
01:56:00,683 --> 01:56:07,213
I am not a beggar!
I am not a beggar!

1423
01:56:21,437 --> 01:56:24,338
So welcome master pasha!

1424
01:56:24,507 --> 01:56:31,242
Master pasha! Master pasha!
Master pasha! Master pasha!

1425
01:56:31,381 --> 01:56:33,406
He has loads of love in his heart.

1426
01:56:33,683 --> 01:56:38,484
Love! Love! Love! Love!

1427
01:56:38,721 --> 01:56:41,315
He is not a beggar. He is an artist.

1428
01:56:41,457 --> 01:56:46,224
He is an artist! He is an artist!
He is an artist!

1429
01:56:46,529 --> 01:56:51,262
And i am sure that only you
can make the temple's set.

1430
01:56:51,701 --> 01:56:56,661
And i am sure that only you
can make the temple's set.

1431
01:57:26,469 --> 01:57:27,527
Udit.

1432
01:57:55,331 --> 01:57:56,389
We are from lucknow.

1433
01:57:56,466 --> 01:57:59,629
So the embassy people
can reject our visa.

1434
01:58:01,537 --> 01:58:06,406
It's not easy to get a visa.
I couldn't believe it.

1435
01:58:06,609 --> 01:58:11,342
The passport was in my hand. And
us visa. Very less people...

1436
01:59:29,859 --> 01:59:31,349
my beloved went far away from me.

1437
01:59:31,427 --> 01:59:33,918
She stole the solace of my heart.

1438
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:35,895
She left behind the
shadow of sorrow.

1439
01:59:35,965 --> 01:59:39,992
Now nothing is left
besides this sorrow.

1440
01:59:42,038 --> 01:59:43,596
My beloved went far away from me.

1441
01:59:43,739 --> 01:59:46,435
She stole the solace of my heart.

1442
01:59:46,576 --> 01:59:48,407
She left behind the
shadow of sorrow.

1443
01:59:48,544 --> 01:59:52,981
Now nothing is left
besides this sorrow.

1444
01:59:56,919 --> 02:00:01,447
There were only tears.

1445
02:00:01,624 --> 02:00:05,082
Now tears too have
been washed away.

1446
02:00:05,461 --> 02:00:13,527
My heartbeats say that i should
stop somewhere here.

1447
02:01:16,599 --> 02:01:23,528
Before leaving i have decided
to marry... mehru.

1448
02:01:26,008 --> 02:01:27,976
You are a hindu. You
know that, don't you?

1449
02:01:32,715 --> 02:01:36,481
If you think that she has nobody
in this world besides...

1450
02:01:36,552 --> 02:01:40,579
...her mother then let me tell
you... that you are wrong.

1451
02:01:42,992 --> 02:01:45,483
If her relatives got an
inkling of this then...

1452
02:01:45,561 --> 02:01:49,156
...your body parts will be found
in the ditches of lucknow.

1453
02:01:50,032 --> 02:01:54,093
And as far as mehru is concerned,
she will disappear.

1454
02:01:55,571 --> 02:01:57,732
And all this will happen just
because i am a hindu?

1455
02:01:57,873 --> 02:01:58,931
Yes.

1456
02:02:02,578 --> 02:02:04,546
And you think all this should happen.

1457
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:05,942
No, all this shouldn't happen.

1458
02:02:07,049 --> 02:02:09,574
But i know that all this will happen.

1459
02:02:11,187 --> 02:02:13,155
What if i eloped with mehru?

1460
02:02:17,026 --> 02:02:19,187
You think that the world is vast.

1461
02:02:19,862 --> 02:02:21,523
But bigger than that
is that you are a...

1462
02:02:21,597 --> 02:02:23,622
...hindu and mehru is a muslim.

1463
02:02:24,033 --> 02:02:26,831
Her relatives will set
the world ablaze.

1464
02:02:26,969 --> 02:02:28,994
What century are you
talking about, anwar?

1465
02:02:29,071 --> 02:02:31,767
This century. The century in
which you and i are living.

1466
02:02:31,907 --> 02:02:33,704
The century that is surrounding it.

1467
02:02:37,046 --> 02:02:40,709
It will be better if you
stopped meeting mehru.

1468
02:02:46,889 --> 02:02:48,789
And stop visiting our houses too.

1469
02:03:53,856 --> 02:03:54,914
Mehru.

1470
02:03:57,293 --> 02:03:59,090
I don't want to lose you.

1471
02:04:00,863 --> 02:04:02,660
I don't want to lose you.

1472
02:04:07,136 --> 02:04:08,228
Don't leave me and go.

1473
02:04:08,370 --> 02:04:10,702
Anwar, mother will wake up.
- Let her.

1474
02:04:10,973 --> 02:04:12,031
Don't act like a child.

1475
02:04:15,044 --> 02:04:18,707
I won't be able to live
without you. I will die.

1476
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:22,715
Anwar, forgive me. But i don't
want to say anything right now.

1477
02:04:22,852 --> 02:04:24,820
Mehru, i love you.

1478
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,683
But i never loved you.

1479
02:04:28,157 --> 02:04:30,717
Hit me! Hit me!
- What are you doing?

1480
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:31,918
Hit me! Hit me!
- Leave me!

1481
02:04:31,994 --> 02:04:33,052
Because i have loved you!

1482
02:04:51,747 --> 02:04:56,741
My heartbeats say that i should
stop somewhere here.

1483
02:04:58,187 --> 02:05:03,750
My heartbeats say that i should
stop somewhere here.

1484
02:05:08,197 --> 02:05:10,222
My soul detached away with me.

1485
02:05:10,366 --> 02:05:12,300
My dream shattered.

1486
02:05:12,368 --> 02:05:14,768
I lost my beloved.

1487
02:05:14,904 --> 02:05:18,101
Why did i receive this punishment?

1488
02:05:20,776 --> 02:05:22,801
My soul detached away with me.

1489
02:05:22,945 --> 02:05:24,879
My dream shattered.

1490
02:05:25,047 --> 02:05:27,140
I lost my beloved.

1491
02:05:27,283 --> 02:05:31,777
Why did i receive this punishment?

1492
02:05:33,789 --> 02:05:37,782
There were only tears.

1493
02:05:37,927 --> 02:05:41,829
Now tears too have
been washed away.

1494
02:05:41,964 --> 02:05:48,802
My heartbeats say that i should
stop somewhere here.

1495
02:05:55,144 --> 02:05:57,135
Those moments dispersed far away.

1496
02:05:57,212 --> 02:06:01,012
There is only loneliness
in this heart.

1497
02:06:01,083 --> 02:06:03,142
I am lonely. I have no hope left.

1498
02:06:03,218 --> 02:06:05,015
There is only painful ambiance.

1499
02:06:07,890 --> 02:06:10,051
I am alive. But i am
not in my senses.

1500
02:06:10,125 --> 02:06:13,094
When my beloved is not with me.

1501
02:06:13,162 --> 02:06:15,027
There is only love
and no zest left.

1502
02:06:15,097 --> 02:06:17,827
I am in a trance. Now there
is only doomsday.

1503
02:06:26,375 --> 02:06:29,105
My beloved went far away from me.

1504
02:06:29,178 --> 02:06:31,373
She stole the solace of my heart.

1505
02:06:31,447 --> 02:06:33,278
She left behind the
shadow of sorrow.

1506
02:06:33,349 --> 02:06:35,943
Now nothing is left
besides this sorrow.

1507
02:06:39,321 --> 02:06:41,186
My beloved went far away from me.

1508
02:06:41,256 --> 02:06:44,054
She stole the solace of my heart.

1509
02:06:44,126 --> 02:06:46,185
She left behind the
shadow of sorrow.

1510
02:06:46,261 --> 02:06:48,388
Now nothing is left
besides this sorrow.

1511
02:07:36,345 --> 02:07:39,508
Dear, you have come.
- Don't worry, aunty.

1512
02:07:40,916 --> 02:07:43,214
Listen... have you seen her anywhere?

1513
02:07:46,955 --> 02:07:50,356
Aunty, i have searched the
entire lucknow city.

1514
02:07:51,093 --> 02:07:53,061
But she is nowhere to be found.

1515
02:07:54,196 --> 02:07:57,029
I think she is not in this city.

1516
02:08:33,402 --> 02:08:34,994
I know where is mehru.

1517
02:08:53,455 --> 02:08:55,582
And then she changed her mind.

1518
02:09:06,001 --> 02:09:07,059
Uncle!

1519
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:12,198
You have grown old.

1520
02:09:12,341 --> 02:09:15,003
But there is no dearth in
your derogatory nature.

1521
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:20,243
And then she changed her mind.

1522
02:09:27,356 --> 02:09:30,223
The culture of lucknow is being
divided into two parts.

1523
02:09:31,026 --> 02:09:32,084
Yes.

1524
02:09:33,362 --> 02:09:34,454
You are right, brother.

1525
02:09:37,466 --> 02:09:39,331
Yesterday i had gone to saharaganj.

1526
02:09:40,035 --> 02:09:45,063
One girl had worn clinging
pants and short top.

1527
02:09:45,207 --> 02:09:47,004
Brother, everything was visible.

1528
02:09:48,143 --> 02:09:53,080
And nowadays youngsters are
in the trance of love.

1529
02:10:00,222 --> 02:10:01,416
You are right, brother.

1530
02:10:03,659 --> 02:10:08,062
Up 32 z 4474.

1531
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:10,264
Brother, the bus has arrived.

1532
02:10:10,499 --> 02:10:12,296
Stop. Stop it.

1533
02:10:12,401 --> 02:10:14,164
Brother, the gun.
- No.

1534
02:10:18,507 --> 02:10:20,031
Stop! Stop!

1535
02:10:20,108 --> 02:10:21,166
Stop!

1536
02:10:23,245 --> 02:10:24,303
Don't start!

1537
02:10:32,087 --> 02:10:37,616
Mehru. Mehru. Greetings.

1538
02:10:41,163 --> 02:10:43,188
Brother is waiting for you outside.

1539
02:10:44,366 --> 02:10:47,494
Udit-bhai, please come outside.

1540
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:51,434
We want to talk urgently
with you. Come.

1541
02:10:59,548 --> 02:11:01,072
Mehru, don't worry.

1542
02:11:02,584 --> 02:11:05,109
Hey, don't go!

1543
02:11:14,396 --> 02:11:18,457
Mehru is my aunt's daughter.
She is like my sister.

1544
02:11:19,568 --> 02:11:23,129
If you loved her so much, then
what was the need to elope?

1545
02:11:23,272 --> 02:11:26,139
You should have told me. I would
have got both of you married.

1546
02:11:27,409 --> 02:11:31,140
Let it be. You tend to
make mistakes in youth.

1547
02:11:31,313 --> 02:11:34,282
Will you eat mango? It
is from mallihabad.

1548
02:11:57,773 --> 02:12:03,177
What fire have you started?

1549
02:12:03,278 --> 02:12:07,442
What fire have you started?

1550
02:12:12,454 --> 02:12:17,221
What fire have you started?

1551
02:12:18,794 --> 02:12:20,352
What fire have you started?

1552
02:12:20,629 --> 02:12:22,256
Aunty!

1553
02:12:33,475 --> 02:12:36,444
Idiot! You had to do all this!

1554
02:12:36,578 --> 02:12:38,739
You have tarnished
the family's image.

1555
02:12:39,881 --> 02:12:42,441
I can't face anybody in the
whole city of luckbow.

1556
02:12:43,652 --> 02:12:47,816
Why did you do this? Shut
her in the upstairs room.

1557
02:12:48,690 --> 02:12:54,219
Allah! Why didn't i die
before seeing this day!

1558
02:13:07,776 --> 02:13:12,270
Why did you create love?

1559
02:13:12,514 --> 02:13:16,883
Why did you create pain?

1560
02:13:17,252 --> 02:13:22,246
Why did you create pain?

1561
02:13:22,391 --> 02:13:27,624
Why did you create pain?

1562
02:13:34,536 --> 02:13:37,562
Very good! May allah bestow
you with a long life!

1563
02:13:43,278 --> 02:13:45,246
There is a limit of shameful deeds!

1564
02:13:45,380 --> 02:13:48,281
This girl has tarnished
our image! Characterless!

1565
02:13:48,417 --> 02:13:49,543
Lock her here itself!

1566
02:13:49,684 --> 02:13:52,812
Stop her supply of food and
water for a week. - Yes.

1567
02:13:52,954 --> 02:13:54,581
I don't know now who
will marry this girl!

1568
02:13:54,723 --> 02:13:56,315
This idiot will now trouble us...

1569
02:13:56,391 --> 02:13:58,552
i feel like strangulating her!

1570
02:17:43,852 --> 02:17:45,513
Come on, the bus is about to leave.

1571
02:17:45,587 --> 02:17:49,523
Rae bareilly, barabanki,
sultanpur, dholpur...

1572
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:52,617
will the bus go to rishikesh?
- No.

1573
02:17:53,795 --> 02:17:56,855
From where can i catch the bus?
- From benaras.

1574
02:18:44,012 --> 02:18:49,575
Brother and sisters! No
need to fear the rains!

1575
02:18:49,718 --> 02:18:53,677
A bus has departed from the city.

1576
02:18:53,855 --> 02:18:58,519
You all remain calm. And
take shelter somewhere.

1577
02:18:58,593 --> 02:19:03,587
And i request all the

I know who are you. Anwar.

1595
02:21:00,315 --> 02:21:01,646
Once when you were a kid,
you had cried a lot...

1596
02:21:01,716 --> 02:21:03,741
...seeing the broken
wings of a butterfly.

1597
02:21:04,319 --> 02:21:07,720
I also know that your heart
is filled with love.

1598
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:10,920
And you want to immerse
yourself in me.

1599
02:21:12,060 --> 02:21:13,152
So why are you waiting?

1600
02:21:44,025 --> 02:21:46,118
Respect to self and respect
to your nation.

1601
02:22:00,241 --> 02:22:06,908
I have locked eyes with you.

my beloved.

My heart is not in my control,
my beloved.

1607
02:22:44,285 --> 02:22:51,817
Love is a life in itself.

1608
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:59,093
Love is a life in itself.

1609
02:22:59,267 --> 02:23:01,758
