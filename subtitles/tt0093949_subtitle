1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,360
Dr.Shirog is coming tomorrow
to check our bank accounts.

2
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,463
And I have given you Rs.2.5
mllllon from my bank, . . .

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,008
. . .without writing any accounts.

4
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:32,063
And you had promised me,
that whenever I wouId ask for it. . .

5
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:34,940
. . .you wouId return it in a minute.
The time has come now.

6
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:37,504
A promise is onIy
a matter of words.

7
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:44,218
Money invested in business is
llke a frog in a snake's mouth.

8
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:49,177
It can escape but it needs time.

9
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:51,325
Time has come before me llke death.

10
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:55,100
Just Iast week, there was
an item in the newspapers.

11
00:00:55,776 --> 00:01:00,697
Under simllar situation, a bank
Manager in Madras hanged himseIf.

12
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,700
You are dying before
being hanged, Mathur.

13
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:08,540
But do not worry.
I wllI not Iet you die.

14
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:13,973
A good swimmer does not get
carried away by waves in a storm.

15
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,817
But makes those strong waves,
his boat.

16
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:22,133
But what about my boat?
It wllI get drowned.

17
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:26,773
J. K. , somehow save
me from drowning.

18
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:31,200
You are saved, Mathur.

19
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:37,914
Consider what I'm going to tell
you as a message from the sky.

20
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,713
As usuaI, your bank wllI open
at 1 0 O'cIock tomorrow morning.

21
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:47,829
And at exactIy 1 2 O'cIock,
it wllI be Iooted.

22
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:52,637
- Looted?
- Yes, Iooted.

23
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:56,477
The thieves wllI Ioot all
the money from the bank.

24
00:01:57,472 --> 00:02:00,320
Add your 2.5 mllllon
aIso in that account.

25
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:06,710
When there is a fire in a jungIe,
the dead ones are aIso considered.

26
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:10,880
AIso considered,
the ones that never sprouted.

27
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:40,729
- Remove the keys.
- Which keys?

28
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:44,412
The Iocker keys. Give me fast,
or I wllI bIow your brains!

29
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,471
Hit me.

30
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:36,344
Look, inspector!

31
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:42,908
Those inspectors have
compIeteIy Iooted the bank.

32
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:47,708
Five mllllon rupees are missing.

33
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:53,461
This guard says that he shot
one of the running dacoits.

34
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:55,392
One of them was injured too.

35
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:58,905
But his accompllces took him
in their car and escaped.

36
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:00,984
Where wllI they escape?

37
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:09,782
No pIace is so far, where the
Iaw cannot enchain a criminaI.

38
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:13,628
Pour gallons of llquor.

39
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:18,428
Bathe anyone coming
to your bar in whisky.

40
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,560
You have collapsed before
drinking, my friend?

41
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,509
This is imported.
Drink it.

42
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,967
You wllI remember that you
had once met a rich man!

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,120
If I start drinking, then your
pockets wllI get empty, friend.

44
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,641
This well is so full today. . .

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,481
. . .that it wllI not get empty
even if you remove Iot of water.

46
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,712
Today, I wllI see how
much you can drink.

47
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,564
And how much I can
give you to drink.

48
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,047
Drink.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,927
Give me.

50
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:27,093
Rich man!
Your territory ends here.

51
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:29,984
Now, my territory starts.

52
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:38,933
You have used all means avallabIe
in the pollce station on me.

53
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:44,700
But my testimony remains
the same as before.

54
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:48,540
- Sir, your phone.
- I wllI be there.

55
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,976
Rest for a whlle.
When I return, I shall show you. . .

56
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:58,140
. . .that I stllI have ways to
make you open your mouth.

57
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,020
He wllI not reveaI
a thing, Inspector.

58
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:05,820
That was a kite that fIew
in the air, got cut, . . . .

59
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:07,740
. . . and fell in your compound.

60
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:13,119
But the one fIying the kite was
someone eIse. His name is J. K.

61
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:19,837
Yes. If you want proof,
then I can present it to you.

62
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:21,760
- When?
- Now.

63
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,960
- Where?
- At HoteI High Rise.

64
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:39,415
Cone in.

65
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:47,036
''But what about my boat?
It wllI get drowned.''

66
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:49,916
''J. K. somehow save me. . .

67
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:51,894
This is the bank manager,
Mathur's voice.

68
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:53,760
Hear more.

69
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:55,830
''It is a message from the sky''.

70
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:01,429
''As usuaI, your bank wllI open at
1 0 O'cIock tomorrow morning.''

71
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:05,335
''And at exactIy 1 2 O'cIock,
it wllI be Iooted.''

72
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:09,279
''- Looted?
- Yes, Iooted''.

73
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,892
''The thieves wllI Ioot all
the money from the bank.''

74
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:16,736
''Add your 2.5 mllllon
aIso in that account''.

75
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:25,045
''When there is fire in the jungIe
the dead ones are aIso considered''

76
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:32,735
Look.

77
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,772
This is the Iayout drawn by him.

78
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,451
The entire pIanning of
the Iooting is in this.

79
00:07:41,568 --> 00:07:45,529
J. K. cannot prove in court
that this is not his writing.

80
00:07:58,048 --> 00:07:59,030
Just a minute.

81
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:02,870
It's your phone.

82
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:05,696
- Mine?
- Yes.

83
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:18,815
It got disconnected.

84
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:28,409
- The phone got disconnected.
- Strange.

85
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:31,616
Thank you very much for this.

86
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:45,052
May I see your bag?

87
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:48,918
It contains certain
papers that she gave me. . .

88
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,455
. . .concerning a case
which I am investigating.

89
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:54,328
But she teIephoned us
saying that this bag. . .

90
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:57,532
. . .contains currency notes which
you demanded from her as bribe.

91
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:03,445
To reIease her brother
from your custody.

92
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:07,067
Take a Iook at my bag.

93
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:09,947
What currency notes are in it?

94
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:31,061
I knew that a woman couId rise
high and become a Goddess.

95
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:35,544
But I didn't know that
if she stoops Iow, . . .

96
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,624
. . . .she can be a snake llke you.

97
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:49,944
As per your orders, Julle has
been rewarded for her job.

98
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:52,824
But the probIem does
not end here, Mathur.

99
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:58,580
As Iong as Julle is allve,
our llves are in danger. . .

100
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:03,707
- Understood?
- Consider Julle dead.

101
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,360
Shanti, you shouId not
have brought Vijay here.

102
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,466
I couId not find any other answer
for his innocent question.

103
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,801
Daddy, I demanded a cycIe.
So, you had to come here.

104
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,949
I wllI never be stubborn.

105
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,357
I wllI never demand a
cycIe. . . never, daddy.

106
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,961
No, son.
Don't say that.

107
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:03,256
I can endure the
taunts of the worId.

108
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:05,980
I can consume poison.

109
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,820
But if you suspect me,
then I wllI die.

110
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:14,299
Son, I did not take a bribe.

111
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:19,097
I did not steaI, son. . . I did not.

112
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:24,857
I did not take a bribe, son.

113
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:33,497
What is it?
Why are you crying?

114
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:39,573
He has Iocked himseIf in one room.

115
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,103
And my son, in the other room.

116
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:47,897
Wonder, who cast evll eyes on
the happiness of this house.

117
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:52,092
Do not worry, aunty.
I wllI expIain to brother Vijay.

118
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,940
And father, you taIk to uncIe.

119
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:07,988
When I used to go the pollce
station in a pollce uniform. . .

120
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:12,791
. . .then nobody dared
to Iook into my eyes.

121
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:18,875
After being reIeased from jall,
I've come here avoiding peopIe.

122
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:24,311
I have come to my own
house. . . llke a thief does!

123
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:27,519
Do not Iose heart, my friend!

124
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:31,359
We wllI definiteIy
find that Iady someday.

125
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,832
Then it wllI not take
Iong for truth to surface.

126
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:41,596
AsIam, one needs evidence
to prove the truth.

127
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:44,958
Truth itseIf is evidence.

128
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:51,640
The moon does not need the heIp
of llght to prove its sheen.

129
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:55,414
The moon?

130
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:59,771
The moon has been
shining since ages.

131
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:02,975
But the smear on it. . .

132
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:09,692
. . .couId not wiped out tllI today.

133
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:01,150
Father! . . . Father!

134
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,647
Do not move, Mukhtar Singh!

135
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
I have heard, that the
market from where you pass. . .

136
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,727
. . . becomes empty when you waIk.

137
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,287
The shops cIose down.

138
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,646
It Iooks llke there
is a curfew in town.

139
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,963
Let aIone Iay peopIe, I've heard
that the pollce too fear you.

140
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,767
But I am not the
one to be scared.

141
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,397
I am a pollceman who wllI
break your jaw into two.

142
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,196
One piece wllI fall here and the
other in prison. Don't move!

143
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,367
Do not move. . . hey!
You are moving. . .

144
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,542
I often see you fighting Mukhtar Singh
in front of the mirror.

145
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,734
You cannot fire with the gun
and you fall instead!

146
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:58,136
What wllI be your state, the day
Mukhtar Singh comes before you.

147
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,502
He wllI be in a pitiabIe state!

148
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:06,292
His teeth wllI be out; his tongue
wllI be hanging out this way!

149
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:11,093
And his eyes wllI Iook llke they
are going in two directions!

150
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:16,372
Go to the pollce station now.
But Iower your Iong neck first.

151
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:19,256
- Why?
- I want to tie an amuIet.

152
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:29,180
After wearing this,
no harm wllI befall you.

153
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:31,736
You have your sister's best wishes.

154
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:33,979
Now take your mother's bIessing.

155
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:37,983
Heaven on earth is
at a mother's feet.

156
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,659
Touch her feet
and take her bIessings.

157
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:45,499
For the first time, you'll be
in-charge of a pollce station.

158
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:51,929
BIess you, son.
May every difficuIty become easy!

159
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:57,599
Did you see, my friend?

160
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:03,829
Your son Iooks just llke
you did in your uniform.

161
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:11,193
If you had not given us sheIter,
then we wouId be Ieft nowhere.

162
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:13,912
God's worId is big.

163
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:18,873
The one who creates llghtning,
rescues the needy too.

164
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,836
He is the one who infllcts
a wound and heaIs it.

165
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:28,407
Man can onIy soothe it.

166
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:33,501
Sir, beteI Ieaf.

167
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:38,879
- Give it. . . Hey, llsten.
- Yes, Sir?

168
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:40,799
Come here.

169
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,555
- Have you heard of Mukhtar Singh!
- Who hasn't?

170
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:49,755
Let aIone the peopIe here,
even the pollce fear him.

171
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:55,189
There seems a curfew
wherever he passes.

172
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,501
Yes, he is the one!

173
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:02,388
It was his bad Iuck that he got
invoIved with me today. Ask how.

174
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,216
How, sir?

175
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,639
I was passing by the market.

176
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:12,478
I heard a voice from
behind saying. . .

177
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,596
''. . . Hey, Inspector!
I hate the uniform given to you!''

178
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,541
I turned.

179
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:23,356
And I answered that. . .

180
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:29,141
What did I answer? . . . Yes!

181
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:33,021
I answered,
''Hey, Mukhtar Singh!. . .

182
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:37,788
. . . I hate the face your
parents have given you!''

183
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:39,839
Then?

184
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:43,448
Mukhtar Singh said that. . .

185
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:48,895
''Inspector, your Iegs are Iong.
They wllI have to be cut''

186
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:50,815
What did you say?

187
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:52,735
What did I say?

188
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:59,772
I said, ''Mukhtar Singh, you're
too fat, a burden on this Iand. . .

189
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,331
. . . I wllI have to
make you Iose weight.''

190
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,528
- What happened then?
- What wllI happen?

191
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:09,371
He attacked me.
I attacked him.

192
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:14,488
I put my hand in his jaw
and tore his whoIe body in two.

193
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,131
I shook his teeth
and in my hand. . .

194
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,687
In my hand were his teeth.

195
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,331
His tongue started
hanging out llke this.

196
00:19:27,488 --> 00:19:32,408
And his eyes Iooked llke
they were moving in two. . .

197
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:38,743
- Who are you?
- Have you heard of Mukhtar Singh?

198
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:41,052
Yes.
We were just taIking about you.

199
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,027
My name is Mukhtar Singh.

200
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:50,260
Then come inside.
Come in.

201
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:04,984
Get a cup of speciaI tea,
some eatabIes and some sweets.

202
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:19,064
Why are you standing?
PIease sit. . . one moment, sir.

203
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:36,438
I share an oId reIationship
with this pollce station.

204
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,639
You share an. . . one moment.

205
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,720
I share an oId reIationship
with this pollce station.

206
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:55,804
Wherever a new officer comes,
I bring a small gift for him.

207
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:06,996
At the turning of this road,
there is a bullding. . .

208
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,443
. . . in which there is my hoteI.
Other business aIso fIourish.

209
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,909
By all means, pass from there
but never peep to see the doings.

210
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,727
Why?

211
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:28,283
Your predecessor
did not accept my gift.

212
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:33,813
And accidentally peeped inside.
Ask, where he is nowadays.

213
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,262
Where is he nowadays?

214
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:40,532
In a deserted corner in the
deserts of Rajasthan, . . .

215
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:48,213
. . . in a graveyard- llke pollce station,
on a broken chair;. . .

216
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:51,321
. . . he counts the Iast
days of his llfe.

217
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:54,455
You seem a sensibIe man.

218
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:57,342
Yes.

219
00:21:57,856 --> 00:22:01,019
You wouId not llke
to go to the deserts.

220
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:02,942
No.
CertainIy not.

221
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:05,503
The probIem is, I have. . .

222
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:10,619
. . .a breathing probIem.

223
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:15,092
Sand is not good for my heaIth.
My physician said that. . .

224
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:24,220
- He said that. . .
- By all means.

225
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:27,579
. . . I shouId eat biscuits mode of
aImonds and pistachio.

226
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:31,358
Do not worry, Mukhtar Singh.

227
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:37,436
I wllI neither peep in front
of your hoteI nor behind!

228
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:43,195
- I'll Ieave, Inspector.
- Yes. Leave without hesitation.

229
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:51,573
Who is it?

230
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:54,486
Come in, Sadhuram.

231
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:58,718
Mukhtar Singh has gone?

232
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,988
Gone? He ran away.
I made him fIee.

233
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:06,872
He tried to boss me.

234
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:11,668
I gave him such a
push from behind. .

235
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:13,919
. . .that he must have
reached his hoteI by now.

236
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:17,430
He asked me not to
peep inside his hoteI.

237
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:24,153
See tomorrow. Neither the hoteI,
nor it's traces wllI be seen

238
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:27,355
- Have you brought some eats?
- Yes, Sir.

239
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,335
Here are some eats and tea.

240
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:43,291
You wouId have cursed me
if you were allve today.

241
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,094
You wouId have asked, why I did
not die before taking a bribe.

242
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:54,808
If I became a pollce officer llke you,
then there's a cause for it.

243
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,614
And If I took a bribe,
then there is a motive behind it!

244
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:03,448
I wllI not hang
myseIf llke you did.

245
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:07,291
I wllI prepare a noose for others.

246
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:13,054
I wllI win the battIe
that you Iost in llfe!

247
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,011
You were a mere arm of the Iaw. . .

248
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:22,174
. . .whom the offenders of the
Iaw twitched and even broke!

249
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,694
But nobody can break me!

250
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,699
Because I'll not become the arm
of the Iaw but the Iaw itseIf.

251
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:36,980
A Iaw that wllI arrest
criminaIs by himseIf.

252
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:42,260
He wllI hear the case
and pass the verdict too!

253
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:48,983
Our earnings for today. . .35,000.

254
00:24:49,663 --> 00:24:53,624
Well done! May such a day come dally.
That's the fun of the job.

255
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:56,190
The pIayers Iose some
and win some.

256
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,070
But the one who makes
them pIay is aIways rich.

257
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:05,790
Who is it?

258
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:31,647
Who are you?

259
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,204
I am greater than you are!
My name is Shahenshah.

260
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,239
Do you know, to whom
you are speaking?

261
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:52,122
I know. . .to the
cowherd from Mathura.

262
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,556
Who used to extract mllk from
cows and buffaIoes and sell it.

263
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,519
. . .who has made this stabIe into
a big gambllng den and a bar.

264
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:09,556
Consider your bar
cIosed from today.

265
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,163
The pollce couId not cIose the bar.
Then who are you?

266
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:23,738
I know, you have that pollceman
under your thumb by bribing him.

267
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:29,663
But maybe you don't know,
that there's a officer in the city. . .

268
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,503
. . .who is not a pollceman
but performs the duty of one.

269
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,819
. . .who doesn't work for the Iaw
but makes his own Iaw.

270
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,263
His first order is. .

271
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:44,856
. . . neither wllI crime be abIe
to stand on its own feet.

272
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:49,332
. . . nor wllI a criminaI pIay
with the Iaw in his area!

273
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:56,380
Many others came to shut my
gambllng den and bar before you.

274
00:26:57,535 --> 00:26:59,902
They came waIking inside.

275
00:27:00,415 --> 00:27:04,212
But when they Ieft,
they did not their Iegs intact.

276
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:09,591
I pitied them and gave them
this crutch for support.

277
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,699
And you too wllI need
that support now!

278
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:42,613
If you vaIue your llfe . . .

279
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:45,436
. . .then you better concentrate
on your oId business.

280
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:48,088
When I pass by this way tomorrow. . .

281
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,560
. . . I want to see the
cowshed instead of this bar.

282
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:56,150
And if that doesn't happen. . .

283
00:28:56,222 --> 00:28:59,638
. . . then you'll face
the consequences.

284
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:14,428
Well Mukhtar Singh,
here I return as I had come. . .

285
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:22,074
. . . with no injuries whatsoever.

286
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:28,884
I belleve you'll feeI the
need for these crutches.

287
00:30:02,655 --> 00:30:08,154
''In the darkness of the
night In the deserted night''

288
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:21,022
''To wipe away every crime''

289
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:30,263
''There comes a Messiah Whom
peopIe call as Shahenshah''

290
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:42,839
Where is the entire amount?
Tell me, bastard!

291
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,882
''In the Ianes of
the city he wanders''

292
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,235
''In the Ianes of
the city he wanders''

293
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,237
''He treats a friend as a friend''

294
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:10,618
''He strikes a foe llke
llghtning strikes in the rain''

295
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:14,615
''In the darkness of the night
in the deserted streets''

296
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,843
''To wipe away every crime''

297
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:27,603
''There comes a Messiah Whom
peopIe call as Shahenshah''

298
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,707
What is wrong, uncIe?. . .
you are Iost in thought.

299
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,043
Read this Ietter.

300
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,980
''I too am a pollce
officer llke you''

301
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:25,112
''What you see is money
accepted as a bribe''

302
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,639
''I request you to deposit this
in the government's treasury''

303
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:36,476
On one hand,
he accepts bribes.

304
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,298
On the other, he wants it to
be deposited in the treasury.

305
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:42,873
I think, he is crazy. He shouId
be admitted to a mentaI hospitaI.

306
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:44,666
- Read further.
- Yes.

307
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:52,730
''I know, it's a crime but I
am doing it intentionally''

308
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:03,766
''Consider it as a way I have
chosen to reach the criminaIs''

309
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:09,245
''If the officer is honest then
the criminaIs act decent''.

310
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:13,466
''But they need not hide their
faces if one accepts bribe''.

311
00:34:13,694 --> 00:34:14,774
He's right, uncIe.

312
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:18,740
I have been a Pollce Officer
since the time you were born.

313
00:34:19,742 --> 00:34:23,190
But I never accepted bribes
to reach the criminaIs.

314
00:34:24,223 --> 00:34:29,241
I used to go to a thieve's house
and handcuff him.

315
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:32,887
That was your way, uncIe.

316
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,503
But the path that he has
chosen is not bad either.

317
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:40,630
Do not choose this path, Vijay.

318
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,670
Even if you do,
then pray, . . .

319
00:34:43,806 --> 00:34:47,384
. . . that you do not
meet an officer llke me.

320
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,814
. .who wllI first arrest
you for accepting a bribe.

321
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,937
. . .and Iater send you
to a mentaI hospitaI.

322
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:26,996
There are too many 3 wheeIers
in the city. Jot his number.

323
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:34,964
I hope, we have not
come to the wrong pIace.

324
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:37,372
Is the address right?

325
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,185
The address and the
pIace is correct.

326
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:46,878
Then why is the pIace Iooking
different? Instead of llquor. . .

327
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:51,731
. . .why is mllk fIowing here?

328
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,261
Hey, cowherd!

329
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:19,732
Mukhtar Singh's gambllng
den used to be here.

330
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:22,010
Why is there a stabIe now?

331
00:36:22,238 --> 00:36:26,035
There was a storm Iast night
which destroyed the gambllng den.

332
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,826
I see.

333
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:34,043
And where is Mukhtar Singh of
whom the pollce wouId fear?

334
00:36:36,478 --> 00:36:37,972
Mukhtar Singh is in
front of you, sir.

335
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:42,362
Wh. .where?

336
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:46,586
In front of you.

337
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:51,956
But. . .

338
00:36:52,158 --> 00:36:54,068
But who is responsibIe for this?

339
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,094
Tell me and I wllI
have him imprisoned.

340
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:03,230
One cannot imprison
a storm, Inspector.

341
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:09,018
How can I forget that I. . .

342
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:15,869
How can I forget that I
have eaten your sweets?

343
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:22,107
I'm not a cheat!

344
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:29,146
I'm ready to heIp and give you
pollce protection even today.

345
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:31,768
Forget about my
protection, Inspector.

346
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:39,384
Heed my advice and get a transfer
far away from Shahenshah's area.

347
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:43,994
I reached a stabIe
from a gambllng den.

348
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,614
But where wllI you go, Inspector?

349
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:49,720
I wllI go somewhere.

350
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:56,989
Wherever you go,
give me your address.

351
00:37:57,182 --> 00:38:01,655
I wllI send you,
not sweets, but mllk.

352
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:04,540
Yes. Send mllk too.

353
00:38:23,454 --> 00:38:24,763
Greetings, Mr. J. K. !

354
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:33,657
I want to remind you that I am
not a criminaI but a deaIer.

355
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:38,205
I have definiteIy broken the Iaw.

356
00:38:38,398 --> 00:38:42,457
But somebody has given
a repIy beautifully. . .

357
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:46,455
. . .that Iaws are made to be broken.

358
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,697
Well said!

359
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:52,476
There is prohibition of llquor
in our country. It is a Iaw.

360
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:59,198
But it is a fact that llquor
is soId and drunk everywhere.

361
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:07,608
Prohibition of fIesh trade
is a Iaw in our country.

362
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:11,671
But I ask you.

363
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:17,438
Which is that city,
that area, where. . .

364
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:21,277
. . . fIesh trade is
not induIged in dally?

365
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:26,581
When I saw, that I had come
to a city of bllnd peopIe. . .

366
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,874
. . .then I stopped my
business of selling mirrors!

367
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:34,230
And opened a shop in that market. . .

368
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:40,631
. . .where you do not have to visit
a tempIe if you get a pIace.

369
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:46,677
For the Goddess of WeaIth
comes waIking to you, herseIf!

370
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:53,341
Mr. J. K. , Mukhtar Singh
was not wllllng to come.

371
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,770
We brought him here forcefully.

372
00:39:57,726 --> 00:39:59,613
Why, you bastard?

373
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:06,135
I heard that you have
started selling mllk again.

374
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:08,762
And, that too,
without my permission

375
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:11,196
He didn't give me the time to ask.

376
00:40:11,262 --> 00:40:12,309
Who didn't?

377
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:17,019
Consider him to be a storm,
whose name is Shahenshah.

378
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:21,755
He confronted me
llke death and I. . .

379
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:28,892
I couId not challenge him.

380
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:36,375
You wllI have to
challenge Shahenshah!

381
00:40:36,446 --> 00:40:39,196
This is my order!

382
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:42,228
You may sllce my throat, Master.

383
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:45,662
But I cannot challenge Shahenshah.

384
00:40:54,814 --> 00:40:56,439
Do you know who this Shahenshah is?

385
00:40:56,606 --> 00:40:59,640
I have heard his name
for the first time.

386
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:04,249
It wllI be better if his
name is not heard again.

387
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:09,619
If Shahenshah is not stopped
here, then it wllI be disastrous.

388
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:14,140
For me. . . for you!

389
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,890
For all of us!

390
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:20,920
I am ruined!

391
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:28,306
I am ruined from head to toe.
Come with me.

392
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:31,927
Wait. You wllI flle a report first.

393
00:41:32,062 --> 00:41:34,964
- Then write a report quickIy.
- Come inside.

394
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:43,448
Sit there.

395
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:52,345
- It is such that. . .
- How?

396
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:57,692
FirstIy, tell me the name of
the person flling the report?

397
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,725
Tarachand BadIani.

398
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:10,042
The name of the father of the
person flling the report?

399
00:42:18,142 --> 00:42:20,989
- Mother's name?
- Chandrani BadIani.

400
00:42:25,438 --> 00:42:27,326
'' Tara, Suraj, Chand''
(Star, sun, moon )

401
00:42:27,454 --> 00:42:29,942
It Iooks llke the
entire sky is here.

402
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:34,517
What is the thief's name?

403
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:39,031
Why wouId I come here if
I knew the thief's name?

404
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:42,043
But you may know his
appearance, at Ieast.

405
00:42:42,654 --> 00:42:45,043
Not his, but her!

406
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:50,549
She dances llke a peacock, has
a peaches and cream compIexion.

407
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:54,811
. . .shines llke a dagger.
But she cuts in such a way. . .

408
00:42:54,878 --> 00:42:59,417
. . .that a man dies first
and then asks for water!

409
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:03,512
You shouId have been at a
poet's gathering and not here.

410
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:07,291
I am robbed.
Therefore, I am here.

411
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,773
WllI I get my things?

412
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:13,081
- Yes You wllI.
- Thank you.

413
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:19,379
- It is such that. . .
- How?

414
00:43:19,454 --> 00:43:26,295
After getting the money back, . . .

415
00:43:26,366 --> 00:43:29,661
. . . a money who shares and eats. .

416
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:34,101
. . . remains heaIthy
and has a Iong llfe too.

417
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:37,556
Understood?

418
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:41,436
I understood.

419
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:46,652
''After eating this beteI Ieaf
from Banaras, I understand''

420
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:52,626
If you do not llve Iong,
then how can I be heaIthy?

421
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,317
Catch him!

422
00:44:46,877 --> 00:44:48,950
Thief! You steaI!
You pick-pocket.

423
00:44:49,246 --> 00:44:54,003
You shouId not be seen
here anymore. Get Iost!

424
00:44:54,142 --> 00:44:56,892
My purse!

425
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:06,163
Before thanking me,
just Iook that side.

426
00:45:11,326 --> 00:45:17,043
All of Bombay's dacoits,
seem to be waiting for me!

427
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:21,210
It is worse ahead.

428
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:25,238
If you Iose your money,
you may get it back.

429
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:28,570
But if you Iose your llfe, then?

430
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,775
The thought frightens me.

431
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:38,235
Whatever happened, happened.
We have to think about our next move.

432
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:40,730
You say I have full
confidence in you.

433
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:44,824
You have nothing to fear
if you come with me.

434
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:46,268
- Come on!
- Wait, sir!

435
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:53,240
First, keep your wallet
on my handkerchief.

436
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:02,105
These rings?
Are they very expensive?

437
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:05,309
There is a Iot
of danger invoIved.

438
00:46:05,406 --> 00:46:08,220
And this?

439
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:10,806
You've become sensibIe.

440
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,583
Now hoId this bundIe.

441
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:20,346
Now, in front of you, . . .

442
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:23,992
. . . I am tying your things
with the handkerchief tightIy.

443
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:29,939
And in front of you I wllI
keep it cIose to my heart.

444
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:37,302
Sir, this pIace is safer
than the bank Iocker.

445
00:46:40,222 --> 00:46:42,164
Now come with me.

446
00:46:42,462 --> 00:46:46,455
Let's see, who harms you.

447
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:55,638
Come on.

448
00:47:06,462 --> 00:47:08,349
Now breathe a sigh of rellef.

449
00:47:08,414 --> 00:47:12,188
We are now in front
of the pollce station.

450
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:14,620
One moment.

451
00:47:17,662 --> 00:47:20,825
Here is your possession.
Now, allow me to go.

452
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:25,912
I know that my things were not
in this Iocker, but in that one.

453
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:30,356
I wllI take you to the pollce station!
You mess with my dignity!

454
00:47:30,462 --> 00:47:33,658
I have not yet done that.
I wllI do so now.

455
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,121
Do thieves have any dignity?

456
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:39,963
I am in charge of the pollce
station that you mentioned.

457
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:50,524
Before accusing me
of being a thief. . .

458
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:54,102
. . .open the handkerchief
and see what is in it.

459
00:48:01,118 --> 00:48:03,387
Did you see?

460
00:48:03,518 --> 00:48:07,479
You may go.
I was wrong.

461
00:48:07,646 --> 00:48:12,599
Tries to act smart!

462
00:48:20,638 --> 00:48:22,198
There she comes.

463
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:26,425
You are Iate.
We had started singing.

464
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:35,668
Don't ask!
I aImost died today.

465
00:48:35,773 --> 00:48:36,919
Why?

466
00:48:37,085 --> 00:48:40,381
Thank God that your
ShaIu has returned allve.

467
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:42,298
How?

468
00:48:42,398 --> 00:48:47,482
Do you know, who the man
whom I wanted to rob was?

469
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,532
Who?

470
00:48:48,638 --> 00:48:57,335
I wouId have easlly
been inside for months.

471
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,528
Can't that pollce
inspector be transferred?

472
00:49:01,598 --> 00:49:05,340
He can be.
But what has the worId come to!

473
00:49:05,662 --> 00:49:09,491
Even a Parsi man roams in
the streets as a pollceman!

474
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:14,038
No. A pollce inspector roams
in the street as a Parsi man.

475
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:21,113
I think, we shouId stop our
business on the streets.

476
00:49:21,245 --> 00:49:26,461
We shouId arrange for a house
or a shop for our business.

477
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,827
Brother.

478
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:45,270
Look at this photograph.
I found it in Shaheena's book.

479
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:51,800
Then I'll have to investigate,
how this Ianded in her book.

480
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:57,116
There is no need for that, uncIe.
I have aIready done that.

481
00:49:57,213 --> 00:50:01,915
His name is Sallm.
He is young and handsome.

482
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:04,795
He come from a good famlly
and has a successfuI llfe ahead.

483
00:50:04,862 --> 00:50:09,335
Where wllI you get a better
son-in-Iaw than this?

484
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,517
What do I know of sons-in-Iaw?

485
00:50:11,582 --> 00:50:17,015
And you have raised Shaheena.

486
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,579
You fix the wedding date.

487
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:23,290
I wllI wear a new outfit and
weIcome the groom's retinue.

488
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:29,050
Hey, Vijay!

489
00:50:32,221 --> 00:50:36,411
Have you finished reading?
Now Iook into your brother's eyes.

490
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,510
And say what's written in them.

491
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:41,882
What's written?

492
00:50:41,981 --> 00:50:47,383
That one chapter of your llfe is over.
Another one has begun.

493
00:50:47,518 --> 00:50:53,682
Very soon, my sister,
Shaheena wllI Ieave her house. . .

494
00:50:53,757 --> 00:50:56,245
. . .and step into her
bridegroom's home.

495
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:01,565
I have met the groom,
seen him and got his. . . photograph.

496
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:05,916
What a IoveIy face!

497
00:51:08,126 --> 00:51:10,329
Listen to me! The bridegroom
wllI be of my choice.

498
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:13,211
I wllI marry a man of my choice.

499
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:17,302
Your wishes won't count.
There are two pollce officers here.

500
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:20,886
We wllI handcuff your wrists,
enchain your feet. . .

501
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:24,471
. . .force you in the paIanquin
and order you to quick march!

502
00:51:24,573 --> 00:51:27,922
Your sister wllI be
dead before that!

503
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:30,813
You wllI die Iater.
I am ready to die for you now.

504
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:34,898
But before dying, I want
you to see this photograph.

505
00:51:35,006 --> 00:51:38,900
I wllI not see this photograph.

506
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,379
''O, sister''

507
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:54,610
''O, sister what do I say
about my brother-in-Iaw?''

508
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:59,669
''God has created a IoveIy pair
llke that of a parrot & a starllng''

509
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:12,565
''What a face!''

510
00:52:36,317 --> 00:52:42,995
''What a face!
He is wonderfuI, everybody says''

511
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:56,120
''Like the moon and stars
above he is one in a mllllon''

512
00:53:00,317 --> 00:53:04,757
''So what if he is a llttIe dark
and his eyes, a llttIe squint''.

513
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:40,850
''His ears are a llttIe Iong
His height, a llttIe short''

514
00:53:49,214 --> 00:53:53,970
''He eats well so
he is a llttIe fat''

515
00:53:54,237 --> 00:54:01,940
''Everything, eIse is fine
do not be under an llIusion''

516
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:39,417
''It is a new worId''

517
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:45,399
''This sampIe is a llttIe oId''

518
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:58,555
''But he Iooks,
a crazy admirer of yours!''

519
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:06,236
''His pants beIongs to someone
eIse and so do his coat''

520
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:42,875
Where is Vijay? Won't he take
his sister to the paIanquin?

521
00:56:37,085 --> 00:56:39,932
You wllI handcuff me. . .

522
00:56:40,925 --> 00:56:42,812
. . . enchain my feet. . . .

523
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:46,074
. . . forcibIy put me
in the paIanquin . . .

524
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:50,012
. . . and order me to quick march.

525
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:56,635
Come on, it's time
for quick march.

526
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:10,588
What do you think?
That I'll cry?

527
00:57:11,581 --> 00:57:13,948
This is an everyday
affair with us pollcemen.

528
00:57:15,421 --> 00:57:17,308
An accused comes to our
Iock-up for some days.

529
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:20,669
He comes for a few days.
We do get attached to him.

530
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:24,508
But when the court sentences
him to llfe imprisonment . . . .

531
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:27,388
. . . we happlly send him
off to CentraI jall . . . .

532
00:57:27,453 --> 00:57:28,380
. . . . and say . . . . .

533
00:57:49,021 --> 00:57:49,948
Come.

534
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:59,068
The shop has been named,
'Chic Massage PaIour'.

535
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:00,442
That's wrong.

536
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:03,804
It shouId be named, 'FairyIand!''

537
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:05,724
Even if an oId man
visits this pIace . . . .

538
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:08,124
. . . . your beautifuI maidens
can within 1 0 minutes . . .

539
00:58:08,189 --> 00:58:11,004
. . . send him out as a young man.

540
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:12,443
I enjoyed it.

541
00:58:14,877 --> 00:58:16,284
I enjoyed it.

542
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:18,204
I enjoyed it.

543
00:58:18,717 --> 00:58:23,474
Make me enjoy the way he enjoyed.

544
00:58:25,437 --> 00:58:27,325
I own a hoteI there by
the name of Dingdong.

545
00:58:27,389 --> 00:58:30,684
Madam, arrange
something for me too.

546
00:58:30,749 --> 00:58:33,564
- I'll enjoy it.
- Sure! Come with me.

547
00:58:39,837 --> 00:58:41,244
Come in, sir.

548
00:58:47,517 --> 00:58:49,405
Massage and make me llke him.

549
00:58:49,469 --> 00:58:51,803
Remove your cIothes.

550
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:56,604
Remove my cIothes!
I understand!

551
00:58:57,117 --> 00:59:02,300
This is the beginning.
Wonder where it wllI end.

552
00:59:02,365 --> 00:59:06,140
I have removed my cIothes.

553
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:15,740
What do I have to do now?

554
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,140
Lie on the tabIe, Sir.

555
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:21,979
- On whom do I have to lle?
- On the tabIe.

556
00:59:22,045 --> 00:59:25,819
AIright.
I'll jump on it llke Jumping Jack.

557
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,180
What do I have to do now?

558
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:31,100
Now you wllI be given a massage.

559
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:37,330
You wllI not be oId anymore.

560
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:43,570
And you wllI be fllIed
with youthfuI virllity.

561
00:59:46,973 --> 00:59:50,289
A combination of
coconut oll and youth!

562
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:01,746
My body has never
feIt this way before.

563
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:06,076
I feeI tickIed sometimes!

564
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:10,876
And sometimes, fireworks
dance in my body!

565
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,276
Sometimes, I feeI llke crying
and sometimes, llke Iaughing.

566
01:00:13,789 --> 01:00:17,105
Your vanishing oId age is crying.

567
01:00:17,629 --> 01:00:20,945
And your renewed youth is Iaughing.

568
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:26,705
How did llghtning
strike in your youth?

569
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:36,785
Hey, you are the same girI who
Iooted me in the open market!

570
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:39,676
- You too are the same, Sir.
- ImpIying?

571
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:42,076
It is the same worId,
the same faces. . .

572
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:44,956
. . .onIy the facade has changed!

573
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:47,355
- What is this?
- This?

574
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:50,717
This is a new photograph
of your renewed youth!

575
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:55,451
Your wife wllI be very thrllIed!

576
01:00:55,965 --> 01:00:57,372
Give it to me.

577
01:00:57,885 --> 01:01:03,123
You can get the photograph
but you wllI have to pay a price.

578
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:05,051
OnIy 5,000.

579
01:01:06,525 --> 01:01:09,373
Inspector. . . no, he is a constabIe.

580
01:01:09,437 --> 01:01:13,692
- Where is the inspector?
- He is sIeeping inside. Go in.

581
01:01:14,205 --> 01:01:19,443
Why is he sIeeping?
Wake up, Inspector.

582
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:22,813
Oh God!
What wllI happen to this city?

583
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:28,092
The thieves are awake outside
and the inspector sIeeps here!

584
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:34,322
Sir, you are here again?
Look at your state!

585
01:01:34,397 --> 01:01:38,652
I am not responsibIe for
this state; they are.

586
01:01:38,716 --> 01:01:45,362
Inspector, I have been
Iooted in your area twice!

587
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:50,586
The Kauravas stripped
Draupadi inside the court.

588
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:52,540
In today's modern worId, . . .

589
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:56,347
. . . those damseIs stripped
me in the open market!

590
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:59,708
It was good that I had bIoomers on.

591
01:01:59,773 --> 01:02:03,548
Or eIse, I wouId have had to
do an open air cabaret today!

592
01:02:04,061 --> 01:02:09,298
Hey, why are just sitting?
QuickIy arrest them.

593
01:02:09,373 --> 01:02:13,628
They tried to rape me.
Come on.

594
01:02:13,693 --> 01:02:18,908
Wait, sir.
First, you have to flle a report.

595
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:21,308
Tell me. . .

596
01:02:21,373 --> 01:02:25,628
. . . .the name of the
person flling the report.

597
01:02:32,861 --> 01:02:37,618
FormerIy you used to pick
pocket peopIe on the road.

598
01:02:37,693 --> 01:02:40,027
And now you have opened
this massage parIour . . .

599
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:41,020
. . . to bIackmall peopIe.

600
01:02:41,085 --> 01:02:42,907
Why do you have to do this?

601
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:47,218
- Do you know anything, Inspector?
- No.

602
01:02:47,293 --> 01:02:50,522
Poverty and unempIoyment are
two sides of the same coin.

603
01:02:51,037 --> 01:02:54,353
It drains out the llfe
from peopIe llke us.

604
01:02:54,877 --> 01:02:57,244
There is nobody who
can put an end to this.

605
01:02:57,309 --> 01:03:00,124
There are many who give sermons.

606
01:03:00,189 --> 01:03:02,044
Sometimes, in the form
of a polltician . . .

607
01:03:02,109 --> 01:03:04,443
. . . and sometimes,
as a pollceman.

608
01:03:04,957 --> 01:03:07,324
But why don't you understand. . . .

609
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:11,644
. . .that the cure for poverty
is not sermons, but money.

610
01:03:14,077 --> 01:03:16,444
I have an alling mother at home.

611
01:03:16,957 --> 01:03:19,804
I do not have money
for her treatment.

612
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:23,164
Then, why don't you work?

613
01:03:24,637 --> 01:03:27,953
Many decent homes tried that too.

614
01:03:28,477 --> 01:03:31,324
But everybody used to covet
me with Iecherous eyes.

615
01:03:32,317 --> 01:03:35,164
After that, there wouId have
been onIy one job for me.

616
01:03:36,157 --> 01:03:38,524
I wouId have to open a
mutton shop somewhere.

617
01:03:38,589 --> 01:03:39,516
Which mutton?

618
01:03:40,957 --> 01:03:43,324
This mutton!

619
01:03:43,837 --> 01:03:49,019
Put your Iegs down.

620
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,859
Is your mother really llI?

621
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:55,739
I do not lle.

622
01:03:55,805 --> 01:03:59,579
If you do not belleve me
then go to Gafoor chawI.

623
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:01,979
Lane Number 1 3,
house number 1 0,

624
01:04:02,045 --> 01:04:06,300
I wllI go.
But llsten to what I have to say.

625
01:04:06,812 --> 01:04:09,660
If you have lled, then note
down your future address.

626
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:13,500
Pollce station Shaitan Chowk,
Room number 3.

627
01:04:34,652 --> 01:04:40,369
You are Iying sick here
and you did not call the doctor?

628
01:04:41,372 --> 01:04:44,634
I had called the doctor.
He even gave the prescription.

629
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:48,465
But I can get the medicines
onIy after ShaIu comes.

630
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:54,226
She had said, that she
wouId get her saIary today.

631
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:58,075
Yes. I have brought her saIary.

632
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:01,916
I have brought it.

633
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:05,745
The saIary.

634
01:05:07,229 --> 01:05:10,076
Do you aIso work with
ShaIu's theatre group?

635
01:05:10,141 --> 01:05:14,396
. . .Yes. I work with them.

636
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:18,225
ShaIu wllI be Iate
because of her rehearsaI.

637
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,156
And I had the time.

638
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:25,435
So she asked me to
give you the money.

639
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:32,146
You are a very nice man and Iook
good too in a pollce uniform.

640
01:05:34,109 --> 01:05:38,866
When I get well, I wllI
definiteIy come to see your pIay

641
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:43,196
Yes, come. . .definiteIy come.

642
01:05:45,629 --> 01:05:48,945
Then, I wllI Ieave.

643
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:50,396
AI right.

644
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:52,796
Take care.

645
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:08,626
How did you get these
medicines, mother?

646
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:12,475
From the money that you had sent.

647
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:14,875
- I sent?
- Yes.

648
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,314
You had sent it with the man . . .

649
01:06:16,381 --> 01:06:20,155
. . . who acts as a
Pollceman in your pIay.

650
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:28,316
Wow, hats off!

651
01:06:29,308 --> 01:06:32,625
What an amazing part,
the pollceman has pIayed today!

652
01:06:57,565 --> 01:07:00,412
Hey girI!
Get up!

653
01:07:01,405 --> 01:07:05,201
You are Iying on a
pollceman's motorbike.

654
01:07:07,165 --> 01:07:11,921
What wllI you do if I say
that I wllI not get up?

655
01:07:11,996 --> 01:07:15,292
I wllI imprison you.
Have you seen this baton?

656
01:07:16,284 --> 01:07:20,081
DispIay the power of this
baton to somebody eIse.

657
01:07:20,157 --> 01:07:22,012
I have seen many such batons.

658
01:07:22,525 --> 01:07:23,932
If you taIk too much, . . .

659
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:27,292
. . . I wllI handcuff you
and Iock you. . . in the prison.

660
01:07:27,356 --> 01:07:32,091
Then handcuff me
and Iock me in a prison.

661
01:07:32,156 --> 01:07:35,452
And throw the key in a deep well.

662
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:40,667
No! You are a pickpocket
and I am a pollce officer.

663
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,828
''A pollce officer you may be''

664
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,508
''You are my beIoved''

665
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:36,763
''Show your authority,
O man with the hat''

666
01:08:36,828 --> 01:08:43,953
''Do whatever you want
to I wllI not fear you''

667
01:08:49,756 --> 01:08:52,603
''A pick pocket you may be''

668
01:08:57,436 --> 01:08:59,803
''The queen of thieves you are''

669
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:04,123
''Pierce me with your eyes''

670
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:11,794
''Do whatever you want
to I wllI not die''

671
01:09:53,053 --> 01:09:56,850
''- Men llke you fIock me.
- Is that so?''

672
01:09:57,853 --> 01:10:03,090
''Men llke you fIock me
many hearts fall for me''

673
01:10:05,052 --> 01:10:06,940
''How can soll. . . .''

674
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:14,610
''How can soll ever touch the sky?''

675
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:19,889
''You, a girI so crazy
Did not reallse this''

676
01:11:18,428 --> 01:11:21,276
''Handcuff me if you wish''

677
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:28,890
''Handcuff me if you wish.
The handcuff wllI be a chain of Iove

678
01:11:30,844 --> 01:11:35,121
''You and me Me and you''

679
01:11:35,644 --> 01:11:39,921
''How can you and me be one?''

680
01:11:41,404 --> 01:11:45,681
''You are brass;
I am goId'' It isn't easy''

681
01:12:52,412 --> 01:12:56,668
. . .wllI have 30 storeyed
bulldings touching the sky.

682
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,977
There wllI be many
bungaIows with gardens.

683
01:13:01,052 --> 01:13:02,907
There wllI be schooIs,
cinema halls, . . .

684
01:13:02,972 --> 01:13:05,307
. . . pIenty of shopping centers!

685
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:09,136
And there wllI aIso be a
spIendid five star hoteI.

686
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:14,897
Consider it a game of mllllons
which I am going to pIay with.

687
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,787
You have pIayed the game, J. K.

688
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:23,963
But the Iand you buy is llke
a woman who Iooks beautifuI.

689
01:13:24,956 --> 01:13:27,323
But when she is stripped,
you reallse. . .

690
01:13:27,389 --> 01:13:34,034
. . .that she has many bolls on
her body which are incurabIe.

691
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:38,364
What bolls are you
taIking about, Mathur?

692
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:47,964
J. K. , this is the Iand
which you have bought. . .

693
01:13:48,956 --> 01:13:55,634
. . .on which thousands of poor
peopIe llve in depIorabIe huts.

694
01:13:56,636 --> 01:14:00,914
Your hand wllI break knocking
on the doors of the court.

695
01:14:00,988 --> 01:14:03,323
But these sIums wllI remain here.

696
01:14:03,836 --> 01:14:08,113
And your new city
wllI bite the dust. . .

697
01:14:08,188 --> 01:14:12,443
. . .which is the most expensive
& beautifuI dream of your llfe.

698
01:14:12,956 --> 01:14:15,804
Mathur, I know the
cure for these bolls.

699
01:14:16,796 --> 01:14:17,724
A Iancet.

700
01:14:19,612 --> 01:14:22,928
And I have many Iancets.

701
01:14:23,452 --> 01:14:25,339
I wllI have to compIain tomorrow. . .

702
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:36,368
- What is this?
- Food, sir.

703
01:14:37,852 --> 01:14:44,049
And I know, that one who shares
remains heaIthy and llves Iong.

704
01:14:44,572 --> 01:14:50,769
CIose it.

705
01:14:50,844 --> 01:14:54,619
We think allke.

706
01:14:55,613 --> 01:14:58,460
What brings you here?

707
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:01,819
You must have heard
of Gafoor ChawI.

708
01:15:03,772 --> 01:15:08,529
Gafoor chawI?. . . Oh, yes!
It is here in my area. . .

709
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:12,859
It is nearby.
What do I have to do?

710
01:15:12,924 --> 01:15:17,659
Nothing.
We wllI do the needfuI.

711
01:15:18,172 --> 01:15:25,329
For 24 fours, you wllI neither
Iook at nor go to Gafoor chawI.

712
01:15:25,852 --> 01:15:28,699
AI right, I wllI not go or Iook.

713
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:36,849
Consider that, for 24 hours,
all wires to Gafoor chawI. . .

714
01:15:36,924 --> 01:15:43,569
. . .all wires have
been disconnected.

715
01:15:58,492 --> 01:16:02,769
This is the Indian
teIephone system!

716
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:06,139
When the wire is connected,
it does not ring!

717
01:16:06,204 --> 01:16:08,538
When it is disconnected,
the phone rings.

718
01:16:10,972 --> 01:16:11,899
No!

719
01:16:41,628 --> 01:16:43,995
Residents of Gafoor chawI. . .

720
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,875
You are given a notice. . .

721
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:52,155
. . .to vacate the entire
chawI in five minutes.

722
01:16:53,148 --> 01:16:57,425
Or the bulldozer that you see. . .

723
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:01,275
. . .wllI be Ieft in your
chawI llke hunter dogs.

724
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:06,065
No house wllI be abIe
to withstand its power.

725
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,475
Nor wllI any man.

726
01:17:09,468 --> 01:17:14,170
So, pick whatever you can.

727
01:17:14,236 --> 01:17:23,761
And Ieave your homes, your shops,
your markets within 5 minutes.

728
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:32,401
ImmediateIy go and ask the
inspector to come here soon.

729
01:17:32,476 --> 01:17:34,331
AI right.

730
01:17:38,204 --> 01:17:41,052
No. I wllI not go
to Gafoor chawI now.

731
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:43,450
WllI you go after the
chawI is destroyed?

732
01:17:45,404 --> 01:17:49,681
ChawIs are created
and destroyed.

733
01:17:49,756 --> 01:17:51,130
For exampIe, DeIhi.

734
01:17:51,644 --> 01:17:57,842
It has been created
and destroyed so many times.

735
01:17:57,915 --> 01:17:59,290
ShaIu is confident . . .

736
01:17:59,356 --> 01:18:02,171
. . . that her brave cop wllI
give his llfe for Iove.

737
01:18:02,236 --> 01:18:03,610
Provided I am allve!

738
01:18:04,124 --> 01:18:11,227
Granted, that Iove is precious.
But more precious is, llfe.

739
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:17,457
After one dies, who knows
whether Iove even exists!

740
01:18:38,716 --> 01:18:41,563
Stop!
Or it won't be good!

741
01:18:41,628 --> 01:18:44,442
Even if everybody from
here comes in front, . . .

742
01:18:44,508 --> 01:18:45,882
. . . the bulldozer won't stop.

743
01:18:48,316 --> 01:18:50,203
Just because someone
paid you money . . . .

744
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:53,082
. . . you agreed to make
us poor peopIe homeIess.

745
01:18:55,996 --> 01:19:03,634
Can you call sheets of tin
and pieces of wood, home?

746
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,562
For poor peopIe llke us, . . .

747
01:19:05,628 --> 01:19:10,297
. . . this is not onIy a
home but a Taj MahaI.

748
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:16,049
Inside it, is a very weak,
very heIpIess. . .

749
01:19:16,124 --> 01:19:19,419
. . . but very precious modesty.

750
01:19:19,932 --> 01:19:24,688
It can die of hunger but won't
sell itseIf llke your integrity!

751
01:19:24,764 --> 01:19:31,409
Today, I wllI drag this modesty out
and make it dance, naked.

752
01:19:31,484 --> 01:19:36,699
You wllI even strip your
integrity for money!

753
01:19:37,212 --> 01:19:41,489
Let my inspector come.
He wllI thrash you!

754
01:19:41,564 --> 01:19:44,379
How wllI he reach here?

755
01:19:44,444 --> 01:19:51,089
I have bribed him with so much
money that he won't come here.

756
01:19:51,164 --> 01:19:54,459
- What nonsense!
- He is right, ShaIu.

757
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:56,379
He has refused to come.

758
01:19:56,444 --> 01:19:59,739
The coward says
that llfe is precious.

759
01:20:04,027 --> 01:20:06,875
My Iove, I wllI take
you with me today.

760
01:20:07,388 --> 01:20:11,665
I wllI show you how
beautifuI the worId is.

761
01:20:12,667 --> 01:20:13,595
Let go off me!

762
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,994
Leave my daughter, rascaI!

763
01:20:17,948 --> 01:20:18,875
Mother!

764
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:43,345
Seek forgiveness at the feet
of the mother whom you pushed.

765
01:20:44,347 --> 01:20:49,104
Or I wllI make you so poor even
death wllI not give you aIms!

766
01:20:51,067 --> 01:20:51,995
Mother!

767
01:20:52,987 --> 01:20:54,394
Who are you?

768
01:20:57,787 --> 01:21:02,010
I am greater than you are!
My name is Shahenshah.

769
01:24:40,252 --> 01:24:44,376
You wllI have to
rebulld the sIums. . .

770
01:24:44,444 --> 01:24:46,299
. . . which you have
unjustIy destroyed.

771
01:24:47,612 --> 01:24:50,295
Or I wllI smash your bones!

772
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:54,360
And pull your skin and make
roofs of it for the homes here!

773
01:25:03,611 --> 01:25:05,499
I ask you now.

774
01:25:07,132 --> 01:25:09,499
If the imposters have a habit
of infllcting injustice. . .

775
01:25:10,491 --> 01:25:12,597
. . .then how did you get the
disease of enduring injustice?

776
01:25:14,812 --> 01:25:16,699
How many peopIe came
to destroy your huts?

777
01:25:17,372 --> 01:25:19,259
And how many hands did
you have to save it?

778
01:25:19,931 --> 01:25:22,135
They have the pollce
accepting bribes. . .

779
01:25:22,203 --> 01:25:24,113
. . . and the pollticians
behind them.

780
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:27,731
They have money and arms.
What do we have?

781
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:30,611
You have a burning
voIcano within your chest.

782
01:25:31,611 --> 01:25:34,459
But you have suppressed it!

783
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:40,375
Don't stop the fire and stop
crying at your heIpIessness.

784
01:25:41,051 --> 01:25:44,848
Their Iawyers had threatened
us that our huts are llIegaI.

785
01:25:45,532 --> 01:25:47,419
If that is it, then so are. . .

786
01:25:47,484 --> 01:25:49,753
. . . the thousands of
skyscrapers in the city!

787
01:25:51,228 --> 01:25:54,708
Come with me.
I wllI tell the peopIe. . .

788
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:56,634
. . . who have
destroyed your huts, . . .

789
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:58,554
. . .that there cannot be
two Iaws in the country.

790
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:03,031
. . .one for the rich
and the other for the poor.

791
01:26:05,307 --> 01:26:07,195
Come on!

792
01:26:54,523 --> 01:26:57,687
Step down from the power
of your arrogance. . .

793
01:26:57,755 --> 01:26:59,577
. . . and face the peopIe who are
harassed by your injustice.

794
01:27:02,606 --> 01:27:04,494
First tell me, who are you?

795
01:27:08,846 --> 01:27:13,931
I am greater than you are!
My name is Shahenshah.

796
01:27:15,566 --> 01:27:17,453
Yes. The same Shahenshah
who is a Iaw, himseIf.

797
01:27:18,926 --> 01:27:22,243
Who apprehends criminaIs,
hears their case. . .

798
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:24,172
. . . and passes a verdict too!

799
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:27,053
What is your impllcation?

800
01:27:27,246 --> 01:27:29,286
You must have heard
of Gafoor chawI.

801
01:27:29,486 --> 01:27:33,131
Heard of?
I have bought Gafoor chawI.

802
01:27:34,126 --> 01:27:36,395
You have onIy bought the Iand.

803
01:27:37,646 --> 01:27:40,166
You have not bought the llves
of the residents llving there.

804
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,848
Who gave you the right to render. . .

805
01:27:43,918 --> 01:27:45,707
. . . thousands of
poor peopIe homeIess?

806
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:48,582
That chawI is llIegaI.

807
01:27:50,062 --> 01:27:54,339
The Iaw wants it demollshed
and it is my prerogative too.

808
01:27:55,182 --> 01:27:58,979
This bullding too is llIegaI.
So, to demollsh it. . .

809
01:27:59,054 --> 01:28:01,868
. . . is what the Iaw wants
and is its prerogative.

810
01:28:04,942 --> 01:28:07,789
Residents of Gafoor chawI. . .

811
01:28:08,302 --> 01:28:11,465
Do to J. K. , what he did to you!

812
01:28:13,102 --> 01:28:14,989
Go ahead!

813
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,845
Listen to me!

814
01:28:49,518 --> 01:28:52,835
If Shahenshah continues
to target me. . .

815
01:28:52,909 --> 01:28:54,764
. . .and you just sit
with foIded hands. . .

816
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,644
. . .then assure that your pension. . .

817
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,564
. . . wllI be soon stopped!

818
01:29:01,038 --> 01:29:03,624
I don't have to Iook
after you for llfe!

819
01:29:06,478 --> 01:29:08,038
I promise you, Mr. J. K. . . .

820
01:29:09,998 --> 01:29:11,885
. . .that Shahenshah
wllI not attack again.

821
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,085
He has spread his arms
enough I wllI order today. . .

822
01:29:15,438 --> 01:29:19,562
. . .to have Shahenshah arrested.

823
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:32,686
What is happening Vijay?

824
01:29:33,998 --> 01:29:36,037
I am worshipping Shahenshah, uncIe.

825
01:29:36,878 --> 01:29:40,620
The evll peopIe of today fear him.

826
01:29:40,686 --> 01:29:43,501
. . . the way Ravana
feared Lord Rama. . .

827
01:29:43,566 --> 01:29:45,421
. . . thousands of years back.

828
01:29:46,573 --> 01:29:52,290
Why can't you do what
Shahenshah is doing, . . .

829
01:29:52,366 --> 01:29:54,221
. . . wearing a pollce uniform?

830
01:29:56,974 --> 01:30:00,935
I certainIy cannot do that.
Therefore, I am worshipping him.

831
01:30:13,934 --> 01:30:16,454
- What is these?
- A gift for you.

832
01:30:17,293 --> 01:30:20,141
Red bangIes for your hand and. . .

833
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:23,021
. . . a bIack burqa
to put over your head!

834
01:30:23,854 --> 01:30:25,742
You are not worthy of
the pollce uniform. . .

835
01:30:25,806 --> 01:30:27,333
. . . that you are wearing!

836
01:30:27,726 --> 01:30:29,581
What happened?

837
01:30:29,773 --> 01:30:33,734
Nothing. But if it did, then
it wouId have been very bad!

838
01:30:34,573 --> 01:30:37,192
I called for heIp
and you did not come!

839
01:30:37,262 --> 01:30:40,229
And the one, I didn't
call for, came to heIp!

840
01:30:40,429 --> 01:30:43,910
He saved our homes
and my chastity.

841
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,997
A man shouId be llke him!

842
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:48,397
Who is he?

843
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:55,110
He is the one whom I have kept
in the throne of my heart.

844
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:58,699
And I pIaced the crown
of Iove on his head.

845
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:03,495
Then, won't I have the
pIace in your heart?

846
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:08,547
There wllI be, outside my heart,
near the sllppers!

847
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:12,070
Oh? Good!

848
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:17,186
Convey my message
to your Shahenshah.

849
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:24,871
If I do not get even with him,
then my name is not Vijay!

850
01:31:26,509 --> 01:31:28,397
Get Iost!

851
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:33,194
Who is it?
Leave me. I wllI hit you!

852
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:35,372
Look who's standing
behind me, ShaIu?

853
01:31:35,565 --> 01:31:37,289
There is nobody.
Come behind.

854
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:40,489
Do you find anyone?

855
01:31:40,557 --> 01:31:43,688
You are here.
I searched for you everywhere.

856
01:31:44,366 --> 01:31:46,253
What do you want?

857
01:31:46,446 --> 01:31:49,129
- There is a Ietter for you.
- Give it to me.

858
01:31:50,286 --> 01:31:53,286
- There is no Ietter.
- No?

859
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:55,853
Wait. Let me search.

860
01:31:57,229 --> 01:31:59,051
- Did you find it?
- No.

861
01:32:00,686 --> 01:32:02,573
- Quick!
- Yes! I found it.

862
01:32:03,886 --> 01:32:05,773
HoId this.

863
01:32:06,125 --> 01:32:08,013
You simpIy waste time.

864
01:32:10,286 --> 01:32:13,449
''I wllI wait for you at 5 p. m.
today at NationaI Park''.

865
01:32:15,246 --> 01:32:17,286
''A king for the worId
but a sIave for you''

866
01:32:30,606 --> 01:32:33,540
I have seen very shameIess
peopIe in the worId. . .

867
01:32:33,613 --> 01:32:35,468
. . . but not one llke you.

868
01:32:35,822 --> 01:32:38,026
I too have seen very
infideI peopIe. . .

869
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:39,949
. . . in the worId,
but not one llke you.

870
01:32:41,326 --> 01:32:43,213
I came to cry on your shouIders.

871
01:32:44,462 --> 01:32:46,666
There is a Iyric that. . .

872
01:32:47,982 --> 01:32:50,502
''Sometimes it is me sometimes,
it is somebody eIse''

873
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:56,581
''You are the betrayer''

874
01:32:57,902 --> 01:33:02,408
I beg of you to go and
cry eIsewhere because. . .

875
01:33:02,477 --> 01:33:04,332
. . . I am waiting for someone eIse.

876
01:33:05,262 --> 01:33:07,782
You are. . .wait!

877
01:33:09,741 --> 01:33:13,865
''You are waiting for someone I
too am Iooking out for someone''

878
01:33:14,541 --> 01:33:19,626
Then, Iook at these streets.
I am going!

879
01:33:54,478 --> 01:34:00,675
''Let me go For I have
a promise to fuIfllI''

880
01:34:01,518 --> 01:34:04,747
''I have to meet someone''

881
01:34:05,358 --> 01:34:09,482
''Who is he?''
''Tell me, who is he?''

882
01:34:13,998 --> 01:34:17,162
''He is my Ioved one''

883
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:32,935
''At the park he wllI wait
His Ietter I have received''

884
01:35:33,774 --> 01:35:36,457
''He has called me''

885
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:41,571
''On your llps shouId
onIy be my name. . .

886
01:35:41,645 --> 01:35:44,460
Do not be so untrue''

887
01:35:46,094 --> 01:35:51,495
''You Iove him It amazes me''

888
01:35:52,814 --> 01:35:58,694
I shouId Iove you
That is your madness''

889
01:36:58,029 --> 01:37:04,074
''When we meet The fIowers
bIoom under the stars''

890
01:37:04,749 --> 01:37:07,597
''In a worId of dreams''

891
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:15,587
''What does he have that I Iack
Does he Iook as good as I do?

892
01:37:16,909 --> 01:37:22,310
''You and he are poIes
apart it amazes me''

893
01:37:23,885 --> 01:37:29,602
''Your Iove drives me insane''

894
01:38:39,821 --> 01:38:44,578
''I wllI come with you. . .

895
01:38:44,653 --> 01:38:49,388
To see your Iover, your beIoved''

896
01:38:50,381 --> 01:38:53,064
''You wllI be enguIfed
with sorrow. . .

897
01:38:53,133 --> 01:38:57,290
''And burn with envy if you see him''

898
01:38:58,862 --> 01:39:04,263
''This is not anger but madness''

899
01:39:05,582 --> 01:39:11,462
''You wllI come with
me it amazes me''

900
01:39:11,981 --> 01:39:15,080
''Let me come I want to come''

901
01:39:15,277 --> 01:39:18,277
''No, Iet me go I have to go''

902
01:39:58,317 --> 01:40:00,205
Who was pursuing you?

903
01:40:00,558 --> 01:40:04,354
He is the pollce inspector
from Shaitan Chowky.

904
01:40:05,197 --> 01:40:07,085
Are you invoIved with him?

905
01:40:07,597 --> 01:40:09,964
No way!
We met a coupIe of times.

906
01:40:10,029 --> 01:40:11,884
And he thinks, my heart is. . .

907
01:40:11,949 --> 01:40:13,738
. . . a pollce station
and he its in-charge!

908
01:40:14,733 --> 01:40:17,416
Then, I wllI fix him. . .

909
01:40:17,486 --> 01:40:22,220
. . . and send him back to the
pollce station right now.

910
01:40:23,854 --> 01:40:25,741
Wait for me here.

911
01:40:31,853 --> 01:40:34,373
Hey! What are you doing?

912
01:40:35,853 --> 01:40:38,536
Enough!

913
01:40:39,693 --> 01:40:41,733
I wllI never come in
front of you again!

914
01:40:42,094 --> 01:40:43,981
Forgive me.

915
01:40:44,974 --> 01:40:47,177
Leave me!

916
01:40:48,173 --> 01:40:51,020
Forgive me!

917
01:41:02,573 --> 01:41:06,370
- Inspector!
- How did you come here?

918
01:41:06,573 --> 01:41:11,275
Where are you trying to escape?
Have you set even with him?

919
01:41:13,069 --> 01:41:16,232
I hoId my ears!

920
01:41:16,589 --> 01:41:21,827
Your beIoved heId my
neck and hung me. . .

921
01:41:22,669 --> 01:41:24,872
. . . as though he was
drying his cIothes.

922
01:41:26,189 --> 01:41:30,630
I swear!
I'll never confront him.

923
01:41:31,309 --> 01:41:34,156
He is truIy great!
Thank you! Bye!

924
01:41:34,349 --> 01:41:36,072
- I'll never see him!
- Acting smart, eh?

925
01:41:36,141 --> 01:41:37,996
He wanted to get even
with Shahenshah indeed!.

926
01:41:53,069 --> 01:41:56,866
''This is what happens to me
every rainy night, father.''

927
01:41:57,869 --> 01:42:00,236
''Showers pour from the sky. .

928
01:42:01,069 --> 01:42:03,338
. . .and bIood drops fall
instead of raindrops.''

929
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:08,007
''Sometimes, I feeI the noose. . .

930
01:42:08,077 --> 01:42:09,932
. . . around your neck is around me''.

931
01:42:10,925 --> 01:42:12,812
''But one question keeps
torturing me, . . .

932
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:17,667
''Vijay, you sIeep but why are
your murderers yet scot free?''

933
01:42:19,245 --> 01:42:23,042
''I promise you, father, that
they wllI be caught someday.''

934
01:42:24,365 --> 01:42:26,885
''A murderer kllIs
but Ieaves behind. . .

935
01:42:26,957 --> 01:42:28,812
. . . the evidence
of his footprints''.

936
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:36,169
And with that, one does find
the kllIer and his address.

937
01:42:40,045 --> 01:42:41,932
Do you see this, Mathur?

938
01:42:42,925 --> 01:42:45,510
When it is removed from the fieIds,

939
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,435
. . . it is worth a few rupees onIy.

940
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,355
It is worth thousands of rupees
when it reaches the market.

941
01:42:50,125 --> 01:42:52,230
And when it's soId,
it's worth hundreds of thousand.

942
01:42:53,005 --> 01:42:57,283
But what is it?

943
01:43:01,805 --> 01:43:08,100
Those who take it become
addicted to it for llfe.

944
01:43:09,261 --> 01:43:13,058
Those who deaI in it
get rewarded for llfe.

945
01:43:13,901 --> 01:43:15,941
It rains goId in their homes.

946
01:43:17,101 --> 01:43:21,706
They get llght from
the shine of diamonds!

947
01:43:22,701 --> 01:43:27,938
I have decided to do
business of onIy this.

948
01:43:31,341 --> 01:43:33,708
WllI this oId Iady
die under our car?

949
01:43:46,221 --> 01:43:48,108
Why are you packing, mother?

950
01:43:48,301 --> 01:43:50,341
We have to Ieave the city today.

951
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:52,428
Why?

952
01:43:53,261 --> 01:43:56,741
I saw the face of my death whlle
crossing the street today.

953
01:43:57,261 --> 01:44:02,018
To escape that death, I had
hidden myseIf years back.

954
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:06,658
And hidden you too.
But what do I do now?

955
01:44:07,661 --> 01:44:09,548
Whom are you taIking about, mother?

956
01:44:10,701 --> 01:44:14,498
About J. K. My chlld, you
do not know that imposter.

957
01:44:15,341 --> 01:44:18,341
PreviousIy, onIy my
llfe was in danger.

958
01:44:18,413 --> 01:44:21,227
But now, even your
llfe wllI be in danger.

959
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:23,309
I wllI challenge every
danger, mother.

960
01:44:25,581 --> 01:44:28,744
You are llke the llving dead.

961
01:44:28,813 --> 01:44:32,587
And the one responsibIe
for it, is enjoying llfe!

962
01:44:33,581 --> 01:44:38,666
Do not worry. I wllI have

968
01:45:25,517 --> 01:45:27,557
Giving tips Iater is a custom.

969

Giving it in advance is a
guarantee of good service.

970

Here is your favourite
whisky. . . .Chivas RegaI.

01:46:44,172 --> 01:46:46,060
Sit comfortabIy!

988
01:46:46,253 --> 01:46:50,049
I thought there was a back
rest. . . .what were you saying?

989
01:46:50,733 --> 01:46:52,621
What wllI you drink?

990
01:46:56,748 --> 01:46:59,596
I refrain from drinks.

991
01:47:01,229 --> 01:47:04,458
The business that I am in. . .

992
01:47:05,709 --> 01:47:07,596
And the job that you are in. . .

993
01:47:08,109 --> 01:47:10,214
. . .are very deepIy reIated.

994
01:47:12,429 --> 01:47:15,745
If we unite, then it is an union.

995
01:47:16,749 --> 01:47:20,546
And if we do not unite,
then is war!

996
01:47:20,748 --> 01:47:24,545
No, certainIy not!
No war!

997
01:47:25,229 --> 01:47:26,789
An union is good.

998
01:47:27,309 --> 01:47:29,414
Sangam is a nice pIace.

999
01:47:29,485 --> 01:47:32,300
By the way, how did you know
that I am from Allahabad?

1000
01:47:34,989 --> 01:47:38,305
I can make that out from your face.

1001
01:47:40,972 --> 01:47:45,991
And I can judge the contents of
a Ietter by seeing the enveIope!

1002
01:47:48,269 --> 01:47:52,393
You can judge the contents of
a Ietter by seeing. . . very good.

1003
01:48:07,084 --> 01:48:11,208
What was the need. . . there
was no need to give this. . .

1004
01:48:12,205 --> 01:48:14,092
Anyway, I'll accept it!

1005
01:48:17,005 --> 01:48:18,892
You are Ieaving now, aren't you?

1006
01:48:22,444 --> 01:48:25,030
Yes. . . I wllI Ieave.

1007
01:48:26,765 --> 01:48:31,369
I shall take your Ieave, Mr. J. K.

1008
01:48:33,325 --> 01:48:35,212
- PIeased to meet you.
- Same here.

1009
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,188
Isn't this your llghter, Mr. J. K.?

1010
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:09,708
I llke what you have done.

1011
01:49:12,301 --> 01:49:14,668
You have not seen
anything yet, Mr. J. K.

1012
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:18,508
A whlle back, a ring
adorned your hand.

1013
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,569
Now it is in my hand.

1014
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:34,341
- What do you do?
- I am Iooking for a job.

1015
01:49:35,341 --> 01:49:37,228
Nowadays, this is my job.

1016
01:49:39,181 --> 01:49:41,068
You have got a job.

1017
01:49:44,941 --> 01:49:47,526
This is my address.
Come at nine in the morning.

1018
01:49:57,357 --> 01:50:01,153
J. K. you have Iooked at
your watch ten times . . .

1019
01:50:01,228 --> 01:50:03,083
. . . in the Iast ten minutes.

1020
01:50:03,148 --> 01:50:05,963
I have seen you waiting before.

1021
01:50:06,028 --> 01:50:10,763
But never with such impatience
and restIessness.

1022
01:50:14,156 --> 01:50:22,274
When oId age waits for youth,
it waits for reaI Iong.

1023
01:50:22,796 --> 01:50:23,723
Really?

1024
01:50:28,077 --> 01:50:32,354
There comes your youth!

1025
01:50:34,797 --> 01:50:37,163
I was waiting for you Miss. . .

1026
01:50:40,557 --> 01:50:43,404
What did you say,
your name was, yesterday?

1027
01:50:45,292 --> 01:50:49,089
You did not ask;
I did not say.

1028
01:50:50,092 --> 01:50:51,499
My name is ShaIu.

1029
01:50:57,772 --> 01:51:00,139
My ears are fllIed with
music just llstening to it!

1030
01:51:04,973 --> 01:51:07,820
I wllI just show her the
house and expIain her work.

1031
01:51:10,252 --> 01:51:16,930
Do not follow me tllI the
city of Bombay is on fire!

1032
01:51:17,005 --> 01:51:17,899
Go on!

1033
01:51:22,732 --> 01:51:24,620
You are really crazy, Mathur!

1034
01:51:24,685 --> 01:51:28,460
I had said not to follow me tllI
the city of Bombay is on fire.

1035
01:51:28,525 --> 01:51:31,820
- Bombay in on fire!
- Meaning?

1036
01:51:31,884 --> 01:51:35,659
A fIy fell in the mllk which
we were supposed to drink!

1037
01:51:35,724 --> 01:51:39,499
And the fIy was none other
than Inspector AsIam Khan!

1038
01:51:40,972 --> 01:51:44,234
Our truck entered inside
India very easlly.

1039
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:51,905
It was stopped at many
checkposts & then allowed to go.

1040
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:54,795
But there is no hope of it anymore.

1041
01:51:54,860 --> 01:52:01,025
Because AsIam Khan is
on duty in Bombay now.

1042
01:52:01,101 --> 01:52:03,915
And you know very well. . .

1043
01:52:03,981 --> 01:52:11,105
. . .that nothing defers Inspector
AsIam Khan from his duty.

1044
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:13,995
You can at Ieast move your finger.

1045
01:52:16,428 --> 01:52:20,225
You diaI.
I wllI give you the number.

1046
01:52:25,068 --> 01:52:26,955
Vijay, what brings you here?

1047
01:52:27,468 --> 01:52:29,835
This is an order for you
from the Headquarters, uncIe.

1048
01:52:29,901 --> 01:52:31,755
You have been summoned to
Chowpatty immediateIy.

1049
01:52:31,821 --> 01:52:34,635
There's going to be
a pollticaI meeting.

1050
01:52:34,701 --> 01:52:36,555
The protection of the
Ieaders is your duty.

1051
01:52:36,621 --> 01:52:39,435
The entire force is
present for their security.

1052
01:52:39,501 --> 01:52:43,210
If that truck passes this post,
then it wllI be disastrous.

1053
01:52:43,276 --> 01:52:48,492
Do not worry, uncIe.
I am on duty here now.

1054
01:52:48,557 --> 01:52:51,372
Let aIone a truck, even a
bird wllI not be abIe to fIy.

1055
01:52:51,437 --> 01:52:53,292
You go. . .

1056
01:53:13,005 --> 01:53:14,892
Stop.

1057
01:53:15,885 --> 01:53:18,732
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

1058
01:53:25,004 --> 01:53:26,891
AI right.
Lift the barrier.

1059
01:53:27,405 --> 01:53:28,332
Go.

1060
01:53:52,844 --> 01:53:55,691
WeIcome, Inspector.

1061
01:53:58,125 --> 01:54:00,491
You have pIeased me, Inspector.

1062
01:54:01,005 --> 01:54:03,371
Name your price.

1063
01:54:03,437 --> 01:54:04,811
Name my price?

1064
01:54:06,765 --> 01:54:11,521
Mr. J. K. when a beggar
wears an uniform, . . . .

1065
01:54:11,596 --> 01:54:17,292
. . . his demands are high.

1066
01:54:17,356 --> 01:54:23,521
The ones who wllI give,
have their pocket full!

1067
01:54:25,005 --> 01:54:28,801
He has pIeased me, Mathur.
You too pIease him.

1068
01:54:28,876 --> 01:54:32,651
He is your reward, Inspector Vijay.

1069
01:54:33,164 --> 01:54:35,946
What was the need?

1070
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:44,578
I hope you have not hidden
a video camera somewhere.

1071
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:47,467
One of my colleagues
had got trapped.

1072
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:15,298
''Do not avoid Iooking at me
Do not hide yourseIf from me''

1073
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,708
''Turn behind and Iook''

1074
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:29,698
''My body is on fire come near''

1075
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:32,108
''And touch me''

1076
01:55:46,476 --> 01:55:52,193
''In bad times I wllI
heIp you in need''

1077
01:55:52,716 --> 01:55:57,954
''Come near, o stranger''

1078
01:55:58,476 --> 01:56:02,754
''And Iet us be friends''

1079
01:57:00,812 --> 01:57:05,569
''The moment of joy is here''

1080
01:57:06,572 --> 01:57:11,809
''Lonellness wllI kllI me''

1081
01:57:11,884 --> 01:57:17,099
''Both of us wllI be mallgned''

1082
01:57:17,613 --> 01:57:22,369
''Both of us wllI be bIamed''

1083
01:58:26,604 --> 01:58:30,881
''Eyes mirror one's feellngs''

1084
01:58:32,364 --> 01:58:36,641
''Of this, the worId is unaware''

1085
01:58:38,124 --> 01:58:42,881
''Of this, the nights are aware''

1086
01:58:43,884 --> 01:58:48,641
''Messages wllI conveyed with eyes''

1087
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:50,976
''Wonder when we wllI meet again''

1088
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:56,736
''Maybe, this wouId
be the Iast night''

1089
01:59:57,740 --> 02:00:02,496
''But Iet's taIk our heart out''

1090
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:08,737
''And whlle we taIk
many names wllI be out''

1091
02:00:31,276 --> 02:00:35,073
J. K. we are ruined.

1092
02:00:35,148 --> 02:00:36,075
What happened?

1093
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:38,441
Our truck reached the godown . . .

1094
02:00:38,507 --> 02:00:41,803
. . . but Shahenshah seized
it and disappeared.

1095
02:00:41,868 --> 02:00:43,242
- Disappeared?
- Yes.

1096
02:00:43,307 --> 02:00:47,082
You know very well there were
goods worth mllllons in it.

1097
02:00:47,596 --> 02:00:50,444
Do not worry about your goods
worth mllllons, Mr. J. K.

1098
02:00:51,436 --> 02:00:53,324
Worry about your llfe.

1099
02:00:53,388 --> 02:00:56,203
. . .which is going to Iast
for a few moments.

1100
02:01:00,076 --> 02:01:01,004
Oh God!

1101
02:01:03,916 --> 02:01:07,233
Hey, where are you going?
She is going to shoot.

1102
02:01:16,396 --> 02:01:22,059
What's happened, J. K.?
You have Ieft me aIone.

1103
02:01:23,052 --> 02:01:23,979
What wllI happen now?

1104
02:01:27,852 --> 02:01:29,259
Do not worry.

1105
02:01:30,732 --> 02:01:35,489
Madam, as per Indian
PenaI Code 306 and 307. . . .

1106
02:01:42,252 --> 02:01:43,659
What is this?. . . He is allve!

1107
02:01:49,932 --> 02:01:56,129
My llfe cannot be finished
by a weakllng llke you.

1108
02:01:58,572 --> 02:02:03,809
Look, how carefully
I have kept my llfe.

1109
02:02:07,212 --> 02:02:10,528
Don't you dare!
Nobody wllI shoot.

1110
02:02:12,491 --> 02:02:17,674
Her death wllI be
caused onIy by me.

1111
02:02:19,148 --> 02:02:21,515
I wllI certainIy kllI her.

1112
02:02:22,508 --> 02:02:25,355
Hers wllI be a sensationaI death.

1113
02:02:26,348 --> 02:02:30,145
Like a poet writing
his best poem.

1114
02:02:30,219 --> 02:02:34,475
Or a painter painting his
llfe's most precious picture.

1115
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:40,225
Assume, I too am going
to make a picture.

1116
02:02:40,748 --> 02:02:48,385
But I wllI use your
bIood instead of coIours.

1117
02:02:48,459 --> 02:02:52,234
What are you doing, Mr. J. K.?

1118
02:02:52,299 --> 02:02:56,555
You are unaware of how precious
the llfe you want to take is.

1119
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:57,547
Meaning?

1120
02:02:59,468 --> 02:03:00,396
Come here.

1121
02:03:06,668 --> 02:03:11,905
Assume, you are pIaying with cards.

1122
02:03:12,428 --> 02:03:16,224
And the opposite person
accidentally throws a Joker.

1123
02:03:16,748 --> 02:03:20,064
And you win a Iosing battIe.

1124
02:03:20,588 --> 02:03:21,515
How?

1125
02:03:22,028 --> 02:03:28,705
Shahenshah has Iooted your goods.

1126
02:03:30,188 --> 02:03:34,945
And Shahenshah's llfe is
trapped under your cIaws.

1127
02:03:36,428 --> 02:03:37,835
What are you impIying?

1128
02:03:38,348 --> 02:03:40,235
I mean, . . .

1129
02:03:42,188 --> 02:03:46,944
. . .that Shahenshah
has onIy one weakness.

1130
02:03:48,908 --> 02:03:50,795
And that is, this girI.

1131
02:03:52,748 --> 02:03:55,114
He wllI die but wllI
not Iet her die.

1132
02:03:57,548 --> 02:04:05,185
If you wish, I can strike the deaI.

1133
02:04:06,188 --> 02:04:08,554
Which deaI?

1134
02:04:09,068 --> 02:04:14,731
The deaI between Shahenshah's
Iove and your weaIth.

1135
02:04:18,124 --> 02:04:20,491
Return this girI to Shahenshah.

1136
02:04:21,483 --> 02:04:26,721
In exchange, Shahenshah wllI
return your goods worth mllllons

1137
02:04:27,243 --> 02:04:33,441
But who wllI tell Shahenshah
that I'm wllllng to compromise?

1138
02:04:34,923 --> 02:04:37,290
I wllI, sir.

1139
02:04:37,803 --> 02:04:44,001
You just showered your
gratitude on me sometime back.

1140
02:04:44,523 --> 02:04:49,280
How can I forget that?
Allow me to prove my IoyaIty.

1141
02:04:54,123 --> 02:04:56,490
At the most,
he wllI kllI me.

1142
02:04:57,003 --> 02:04:59,851
I am wllllng to do
even do that for you.

1143
02:05:00,364 --> 02:05:01,771
I am going. . .

1144
02:05:05,643 --> 02:05:08,010
I forgot about the bag.

1145
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:43,947
Shower bullets on him!

1146
02:05:44,012 --> 02:05:49,707
So that no Shahenshah wllI
ever dare to rise my stature!

1147
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,067
- No!
- Stop!

1148
02:06:16,556 --> 02:06:17,483
Come here!

1149
02:07:05,932 --> 02:07:12,129
I knew, that an immoraI man llke
you wouId do something so IowIy!

1150
02:07:13,131 --> 02:07:16,448
You had thrown some fireworks here.

1151
02:07:16,971 --> 02:07:19,819
I think, you are fond of them.

1152
02:07:23,212 --> 02:07:27,969
I wllI show you a sampIe of that.

1153
02:08:11,627 --> 02:08:12,554
UncIe.

1154
02:08:13,547 --> 02:08:16,863
I want to see what
you have in your bag.

1155
02:08:17,387 --> 02:08:21,184
In this. . . there are
onIy some oId flles.

1156
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:24,555
I wllI see today,
which flles you have got.

1157
02:08:34,667 --> 02:08:40,384
This is the money my friend
gave to deposit in the bank.

1158
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:42,794
Have the deaIers of death
become your friends now?

1159
02:08:43,307 --> 02:08:47,104
Tell me truthfully.
Isn't this the bribe. . .

1160
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:49,514
. . .that you received
to Iet that truck go?

1161
02:08:51,947 --> 02:08:56,224
I didn't know, you couId sell
your virtue for such a Iow price

1162
02:08:56,299 --> 02:08:58,568
. . . and sell your integrity.

1163
02:08:59,564 --> 02:09:01,451
Where wllI I get the knife
with which I can cut. . .

1164
02:09:01,515 --> 02:09:05,771
. . .your surname from
next to your name?

1165
02:09:11,084 --> 02:09:15,361
UncIe, you are my eIder.
You can do whatever you pIease.

1166
02:09:15,884 --> 02:09:18,731
To hear it and bow my head
before you, is my duty.

1167
02:09:18,795 --> 02:09:21,610
Your duty was what
you did not fuIfllI.

1168
02:09:21,675 --> 02:09:26,891
Now it becomes my duty to tear
your uniform with my hands.

1169
02:09:27,404 --> 02:09:31,200
To tear the stars
from your shouIders!

1170
02:09:32,204 --> 02:09:36,481
This cap is the crown of
every respectfuI pollceman.

1171
02:09:36,556 --> 02:09:38,890
I feeI llke trampllng
it under my boots.

1172
02:09:39,884 --> 02:09:43,680
The strength of the government
is behind this baton.

1173
02:09:43,755 --> 02:09:47,051
I want to break your bones with it.

1174
02:09:47,116 --> 02:09:50,891
So that you won't be abIe
to get up or llft your head.

1175
02:09:50,956 --> 02:09:52,811
You have done what
you had to, brother.

1176
02:09:55,244 --> 02:09:57,066
Now, I wllI do what I have to.

1177
02:09:58,539 --> 02:10:00,906
You have onIy torn his uniform.

1178
02:10:01,899 --> 02:10:03,787
I wllI have his hide!

1179
02:10:18,219 --> 02:10:22,497
If I knew, I wouId give birth
to such a disgracefuI son, . . .

1180
02:10:22,571 --> 02:10:26,346
. . .then I wouId have torn
my womb with my own nalls!

1181
02:10:27,819 --> 02:10:31,136
I had this evll in my
womb for nine months.

1182
02:10:31,211 --> 02:10:33,546
You raised him for years.

1183
02:10:34,091 --> 02:10:39,307
So that he wouId grow up
and spit on his father's honour.

1184
02:10:39,371 --> 02:10:41,705
And aIso disgrace you!

1185
02:10:44,139 --> 02:10:46,027
Get out of my sight!

1186
02:10:47,019 --> 02:10:52,736
Henceforth consider
that I am dead for you.

1187
02:10:53,675 --> 02:10:56,042
And you are dead for me!

1188
02:11:08,075 --> 02:11:10,442
You have considered me dead.

1189
02:11:11,915 --> 02:11:15,231
Then, before bidding farewell
to this corpse, bIess him.

1190
02:11:21,515 --> 02:11:22,922
I promise you, mother.

1191
02:11:23,435 --> 02:11:28,672
. .that I wllI not come in front
of you tllI I restore my honour.

1192
02:11:33,995 --> 02:11:36,362
Drugs worth mllllons seized.

1193
02:11:36,427 --> 02:11:38,282
Read about J. K's llIegaI business.

1194
02:11:38,347 --> 02:11:40,681
. . .written by the famous crime
reporter Mohammed Sallm.

1195
02:11:46,475 --> 02:11:49,791
Editor Mohammed Sallm
wllI not improve.

1196
02:11:51,212 --> 02:11:54,059
Driver, go to Action Times.

1197
02:12:06,572 --> 02:12:07,979
Do you wish to meet me?

1198
02:12:08,492 --> 02:12:12,769
Tell me.
My name is Mohammed Sallm.

1199
02:12:14,252 --> 02:12:18,529
Have you written
the report on drugs?

1200
02:12:19,052 --> 02:12:19,979
Yes.

1201
02:12:20,043 --> 02:12:23,818
My name has been publlshed
in your papers once.

1202
02:12:23,883 --> 02:12:25,258
It shouIdn't be repeated.

1203
02:12:27,692 --> 02:12:29,579
I can pay a price.

1204
02:12:29,643 --> 02:12:32,939
You can name your price.

1205
02:12:33,452 --> 02:12:36,299
You have come to the
wrong pIace, Mr. J. K.

1206
02:12:36,811 --> 02:12:39,178
This is a pIace where
truth prevalls. . .

1207
02:12:39,243 --> 02:12:43,499
PrincipIes are neither
soId. . . nor bought here.

1208
02:12:44,972 --> 02:12:47,339
Then hear me out, young man.

1209
02:12:47,852 --> 02:12:51,648
I may not be abIe to buy the pen.

1210
02:12:52,171 --> 02:12:55,019
But I can definiteIy break it.

1211
02:12:56,011 --> 02:12:58,859
Then hear me out too, Mr. J. K.

1212
02:12:59,372 --> 02:13:05,088
Like every reporter, ink fIows
in my veins instead of bIood.

1213
02:13:05,611 --> 02:13:07,978
And as Iong as that ink fIows, . . .

1214
02:13:08,043 --> 02:13:11,339
. . . my pen wllI not trembIe
to write the truth.

1215
02:13:11,852 --> 02:13:17,089
Then I wllI have to see whether
my hands wllI trembIe. . .

1216
02:13:17,163 --> 02:13:22,378
. . .to finish your work.

1217
02:13:45,452 --> 02:13:52,075
He had publlshed my
name in the newspapers.

1218
02:13:53,067 --> 02:13:57,345
And I wiped off his name
from the book of llfe.

1219
02:13:58,827 --> 02:14:03,584
If any of you try
to take my name, . . .

1220
02:14:03,659 --> 02:14:10,304
. . .then his famlly and he'll have
to face this bIoody consequence.

1221
02:14:20,907 --> 02:14:25,185
Wake up, Sallm.
Wake up.

1222
02:14:26,667 --> 02:14:30,464
It is time to go to your press
Don't you have to go there?

1223
02:14:33,387 --> 02:14:36,704
Why aren't you getting
up from your sIeep today?

1224
02:14:42,027 --> 02:14:43,849
Are you seeing Shaheena's state?

1225
02:14:44,843 --> 02:14:46,730
She has not shed a singIe tear.

1226
02:14:47,723 --> 02:14:49,610
She has not screamed even once.

1227
02:14:50,603 --> 02:14:52,970
If she does not have
a catharsis, . . .

1228
02:14:53,035 --> 02:14:55,850
. . . then it couId
prove fataI to her.

1229
02:14:57,323 --> 02:15:00,639
So I want you to
make her cry a Iot.

1230
02:15:01,163 --> 02:15:05,440
There is a llmit to sIeeping!
Wake up, Sallm!

1231
02:15:05,515 --> 02:15:10,730
Whom are you trying to awake?
He wllI never wake up.

1232
02:15:10,795 --> 02:15:15,529
- Your Sallm is dead.
- For God's sake, don't say that

1233
02:15:16,523 --> 02:15:20,320
You are calling my
allve husband as dead?

1234
02:15:20,395 --> 02:15:22,729
What eIse do I call him?

1235
02:15:23,243 --> 02:15:27,040
Accept the catastrophe
that has happened to you.

1236
02:15:27,115 --> 02:15:33,760
Do not try to hide the
truth behind your madness.

1237
02:15:33,835 --> 02:15:36,649
Your Sallm is dead!

1238
02:15:36,715 --> 02:15:38,569
You have become a widow!

1239
02:15:56,779 --> 02:15:58,666
''O sister''

1240
02:16:00,619 --> 02:16:05,375
''What do I say about
any brother-in-Iaw?''

1241
02:16:18,859 --> 02:16:23,615
''God has made such a pair''

1242
02:16:37,099 --> 02:16:38,921
''O sister. . .''

1243
02:17:35,595 --> 02:17:37,897
Mr. J. K. has sent these fIowers.

1244
02:17:37,963 --> 02:17:40,297
He is deepIy stirred
about such a young death.

1245
02:17:52,811 --> 02:17:53,738
Wait!

1246
02:17:55,691 --> 02:18:00,448
These fIowers wllI not be
put on Mr. Sallm's body.

1247
02:18:00,523 --> 02:18:06,218
His corpse has just been
bathed with the hoIy water.

1248
02:18:06,283 --> 02:18:10,057
And the coffin has been
brought from the HoIy Mecca.

1249
02:18:10,123 --> 02:18:14,378
J. K.'s sins cannot
be pIaced on that!

1250
02:18:14,891 --> 02:18:17,738
I witnessed this death.

1251
02:18:17,803 --> 02:18:22,058
I was sllent tllI now
for fear of my death.

1252
02:18:22,123 --> 02:18:25,898
But now, I onIy fear God.

1253
02:18:25,963 --> 02:18:30,698
So I wllI break this sllence.

1254
02:18:31,211 --> 02:18:34,953
I wllI tell, who kllIed Mr. Sallm.

1255
02:18:36,907 --> 02:18:41,664
I wllI tell you. . .

1256
02:19:03,787 --> 02:19:06,154
On whose orders did you shoot?

1257
02:19:06,346 --> 02:19:08,867
If I reveaI his name,
then he wllI kllI me.

1258
02:19:09,067 --> 02:19:13,028
Even I wllI kllI you but you
wllI have to tell me his name.

1259
02:19:14,827 --> 02:19:17,511
Tell.
Tell!

1260
02:19:36,683 --> 02:19:39,847
Tell J. K. that Srivastav
has a warrant to arrest him.

1261
02:19:45,962 --> 02:19:48,329
Haven't you been abIe to digest. . .

1262
02:19:48,394 --> 02:19:51,209
. . . the bribe that
I threw before you?

1263
02:19:52,363 --> 02:19:55,843
Or has a bone got
stuck in your throat?

1264
02:20:00,683 --> 02:20:02,952
You shouId count
your bones properIy.

1265
02:20:04,523 --> 02:20:08,320
In the process of going to
prison and coming out, . . .

1266
02:20:08,394 --> 02:20:11,209
. . .there may be a
difference in your counting!

1267
02:20:13,163 --> 02:20:16,163
I have come to arrest you for the
murder of crime reporter, Sallm.

1268
02:20:20,043 --> 02:20:21,930
Here is your warrant.

1269
02:20:28,843 --> 02:20:31,461
And here are the
pieces of your warrant.

1270
02:20:32,939 --> 02:20:36,419
Collect them,
pick it up and get Iost!

1271
02:20:38,443 --> 02:20:41,542
The book of your crime wllI not
cIose by tearing the warrant.

1272
02:20:43,243 --> 02:20:48,578
It wllI be cIosed the day you die.

1273
02:20:49,963 --> 02:20:53,378
And on the Iast page wllI
be written, ''The End.''

1274
02:20:55,338 --> 02:21:00,423
It wllI be wise if you extend
your hands without a fuss. . .

1275
02:21:01,739 --> 02:21:03,626
. . .so that I can put
handcuffs around it.

1276
02:21:07,818 --> 02:21:14,180
Before you can arrest me,
your dead body wllI be at my feet.

1277
02:21:31,435 --> 02:21:35,712
Even if there is heap
of corpses here, . . .

1278
02:21:35,787 --> 02:21:40,522
Then I wllI drag you over
it and put you in prison.

1279
02:21:48,075 --> 02:21:49,962
Mr. J. K. in prison?

1280
02:21:51,915 --> 02:21:54,915
When great men llke Gandhi
couId get imprisoned.

1281
02:21:54,987 --> 02:21:57,802
Then why not an
imposter llke J. K.?

1282
02:22:00,714 --> 02:22:02,602
Today, I reallsed,
why this pIace is called. . .

1283
02:22:02,667 --> 02:22:04,522
. . . ''Shaitan'' (imposter) Chowk.

1284
02:22:05,674 --> 02:22:09,155
Amazing!
What am I seeing?

1285
02:22:09,835 --> 02:22:13,151
Such a great man behind bars
llke ordinary criminaIs?

1286
02:22:13,995 --> 02:22:16,264
He is a great man
and a great criminaI.

1287
02:22:17,515 --> 02:22:19,402
Nothing about him is ordinary.

1288
02:22:19,914 --> 02:22:22,980
The matter wllI not end here.
It wllI reach very far.

1289
02:22:23,595 --> 02:22:26,442
Have you forgotten about the
bag you got from J. K.'s home. . .

1290
02:22:26,507 --> 02:22:28,678
. . . and the enveIope
which I gave you.

1291
02:22:33,354 --> 02:22:36,999
There wllI be no enveIope which
wllI not be opened Mr. Mathur.

1292
02:22:37,995 --> 02:22:40,264
What won't open are the
doors of this jall. . .

1293
02:22:41,034 --> 02:22:43,718
. . . where my criminaI
is imprisoned.

1294
02:22:44,139 --> 02:22:46,921
- Then I wllI use my infIuence
- Who is the in-charge here?

1295
02:22:51,115 --> 02:22:53,319
There comes your infIuence!

1296
02:22:54,634 --> 02:22:56,195
WeIcome Mr. Pathak and Iook. . .

1297
02:22:56,267 --> 02:22:59,081
. . . at what is happening
in your administration.

1298
02:22:59,274 --> 02:23:01,958
- Who is the in-charge here?
- I am.

1299
02:23:05,034 --> 02:23:06,922
My name is Vijaykumar Srivastav.

1300
02:23:10,315 --> 02:23:14,438
Do you know, that for
alleging and arresting. . .

1301
02:23:14,507 --> 02:23:18,435
. . .a decent man llke J. K. ,
I can have you sacked?

1302
02:23:19,275 --> 02:23:21,315
FirstIy, I can have you arrested. . .

1303
02:23:21,387 --> 02:23:23,175
. . .for Iaying your hands on
the uniform of a pollceman.

1304
02:23:26,570 --> 02:23:28,774
As for the charges. . .

1305
02:23:28,842 --> 02:23:31,657
The court wllI decide whether,
it is true or faIse.

1306
02:23:33,611 --> 02:23:35,498
You do not know, who I am.

1307
02:23:35,595 --> 02:23:37,734
You are the Ieader of
this unfortunate country.

1308
02:23:37,803 --> 02:23:40,617
. . .who instead of
strengthening the Iaw. .

1309
02:23:40,683 --> 02:23:43,497
. . . has come waIking here
to side the criminaI.

1310
02:23:47,690 --> 02:23:52,447
You forget your llmits due to the
zeaI of your youth and anger.

1311
02:23:53,450 --> 02:23:56,614
Who has given you the
right to arrest J. K?.

1312
02:23:56,682 --> 02:24:00,774
. . .on the basis of suspicion
for a grave crime llke murder?

1313
02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:03,978
The Iaw of the country
has given me the right.

1314
02:24:04,491 --> 02:24:10,688
I order you to open the door of
the cell, apoIogise to J. K. . .

1315
02:24:10,763 --> 02:24:13,097
. . . and reIease him.

1316
02:24:13,931 --> 02:24:18,054
You have no evidence.
If you do, then present it.

1317
02:24:18,731 --> 02:24:20,553
Here is the evidence, Commissioner.

1318
02:24:22,506 --> 02:24:25,354
This newspaper has the
victim's bIood on it. . .

1319
02:24:25,418 --> 02:24:28,233
. . .and the fingerprints
of the murderer.

1320
02:24:29,387 --> 02:24:33,347
When the murderer came out
of the press after kllllng. . .

1321
02:24:33,418 --> 02:24:35,906
. . .then, he was wiping his bIood
stained hands with this paper.

1322
02:24:37,866 --> 02:24:41,030
Yes, J. K. , I am yet allve.

1323
02:24:42,666 --> 02:24:45,666
Maybe, nature had saved me. . .

1324
02:24:45,738 --> 02:24:49,513
. . .to have you hanged to death.

1325
02:24:56,106 --> 02:24:59,270
WllI you abIe to testify
what you just did, . .

1326
02:24:59,338 --> 02:25:01,193
. . .at the court tomorrow?

1327
02:25:02,506 --> 02:25:04,393
Yes!

1328
02:25:04,746 --> 02:25:06,950
Do anything, Inspector!

1329
02:25:08,746 --> 02:25:12,543
This Iady wllI not reach
the court to testify.

1330
02:25:13,546 --> 02:25:15,434
. . . under no circumstances!

1331
02:25:16,587 --> 02:25:18,409
. . . under no cost!

1332
02:25:22,922 --> 02:25:24,809
I wllI show you, J. K.

1333
02:25:25,483 --> 02:25:27,850
This Iady wllI reach
the court to testify.

1334
02:25:29,067 --> 02:25:32,482
Under any circumstances!
At any cost!

1335
02:27:54,474 --> 02:27:57,474
Vijay, take my car and go.
I wllI handIe these men.

1336
02:27:57,675 --> 02:28:00,358
- No, uncIe.
- Go! There is llttIe time.

1337
02:28:48,490 --> 02:28:50,378
The witness is here.

1338
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:54,050
You can see, why we have
reached the court Iate.

1339
02:28:55,850 --> 02:28:59,811
There was not a road,
a junction in the city. . .

1340
02:28:59,882 --> 02:29:03,657
. . .where the murderers did
not shower bullets on us.

1341
02:29:09,226 --> 02:29:11,113
I have brought this
Iady to court, J. K.

1342
02:29:12,426 --> 02:29:14,313
To testify against you.

1343
02:29:25,866 --> 02:29:29,990
Did you witness the murder of editor,
Sallm Mohammed, or not?

1344
02:29:31,306 --> 02:29:34,153
I had some work
outside the press. . .

1345
02:29:34,250 --> 02:29:37,665
Answer onIy to the
question you are asked!

1346
02:29:38,186 --> 02:29:41,033
Did you witness the murder or not?

1347
02:29:41,866 --> 02:29:44,713
No, I did not witness it.

1348
02:29:54,986 --> 02:29:58,150
Is this not the newspaper, . . .

1349
02:29:58,218 --> 02:30:02,310
. . .with which J. K. was wiping
his bIood stained hand outside?

1350
02:30:03,626 --> 02:30:05,765
Yes, it is the same newspaper.

1351
02:30:08,843 --> 02:30:10,882
It is the same
newspaper, Your Honour.

1352
02:30:10,954 --> 02:30:13,442
But as per the doctor's report, . . .

1353
02:30:13,514 --> 02:30:18,565
. . . the fingerprints are not
of a human but of an animaI.

1354
02:30:25,002 --> 02:30:28,166
There are many peopIe
working at the press. . .

1355
02:30:28,234 --> 02:30:30,089
. . . where the murder occurred.

1356
02:30:30,762 --> 02:30:34,723
But why hasn't even one witness
been presented to the court?

1357
02:30:35,882 --> 02:30:38,729
Because the witness
is made a victim. . .

1358
02:30:38,794 --> 02:30:41,609
. . . of a bullet
before reaching here.

1359
02:30:43,562 --> 02:30:49,923
I request the court to
summon Rana Pratap Singh.

1360
02:30:53,162 --> 02:30:58,879
You have testified that you
shot on Mr. J. K's orders.

1361
02:30:59,562 --> 02:31:03,621
I was forced to testify
this at gun point.

1362
02:31:05,898 --> 02:31:09,062
Who had you at gun point?

1363
02:31:11,178 --> 02:31:13,066
He is Iying, Your Honour.

1364
02:31:13,258 --> 02:31:16,903
I fully agree with Inspector
Srivastav, Your Honour.

1365
02:31:18,058 --> 02:31:19,946
This man is Iying.

1366
02:31:21,578 --> 02:31:26,335
The truth is that the murder did
not occur on J. K.'s orders. .

1367
02:31:26,410 --> 02:31:28,264
. . . but yours!

1368
02:31:28,618 --> 02:31:33,059
- How dare you!
- This is a fact.

1369
02:31:33,258 --> 02:31:37,863
And if you do not pIead
gullty within a minute, . . .

1370
02:31:38,058 --> 02:31:42,663
. . . then I wllI shoot
you with this gun!

1371
02:31:44,042 --> 02:31:49,705
You wllI have to testify
that you were responsibIe!

1372
02:31:50,538 --> 02:31:53,538
- Testify!
- Yes, I am responsibIe.

1373
02:31:58,442 --> 02:32:04,158
The bullet is as fake as
this case made by the pollce.

1374
02:32:05,418 --> 02:32:09,858
If a judge llke you can take
the bIame of a murder. . .

1375
02:32:09,930 --> 02:32:11,785
. . .committed by someone eIse, . . .

1376
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:15,625
. . .then how couId this poor man. . .

1377
02:32:15,690 --> 02:32:19,465
. . . refuse to faIseIy
testify at gun point?

1378
02:32:22,698 --> 02:32:26,822
With this, ends all the defense.

1379
02:32:28,778 --> 02:32:30,665
And the case has
become crystaI cIear.

1380
02:32:32,618 --> 02:32:36,742
The case framed by the pollce
for murder, against Mr. J. K. , . . .

1381
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:43,302
. . . is faIse.
The court shouId acquit Mr. J. K. !

1382
02:32:44,138 --> 02:32:46,025
That's his prerogative!

1383
02:32:51,818 --> 02:32:57,798
The court has reached a verdict
that the case against Mr.J. K. . . .

1384
02:32:57,866 --> 02:33:03,616
. . . is faIse, baseIess
and llIegaI.

1385
02:33:04,234 --> 02:33:08,358
Therefore, the court
acquits Mr. J. K.

1386
02:33:14,954 --> 02:33:17,801
- CongratuIations, Mr. J. K.
- CongratuIations, Mr. J. K.

1387
02:33:25,034 --> 02:33:28,198
Twenty years ago, . . .

1388
02:33:28,266 --> 02:33:33,001
. . . an inspector llke
you had tried to trap me.

1389
02:33:34,154 --> 02:33:36,041
Nothing happened to me.

1390
02:33:36,554 --> 02:33:41,792
But that poor man hanged
himseIf to death Inspector.

1391
02:33:43,274 --> 02:33:48,512
Incidentally, his name
was aIso Srivastav.

1392
02:34:35,050 --> 02:34:37,254
Your case is not yet over, J. K.

1393
02:34:37,610 --> 02:34:39,170
What nonsense!

1394
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:43,330
Didn't you hear the
judge acquitting me!

1395
02:34:44,010 --> 02:34:46,858
PeopIe llke you can
never be acquitted.

1396
02:34:48,810 --> 02:34:51,079
Your case may be
over in this court.

1397
02:34:52,905 --> 02:34:54,793
But it has not yet
begun in my court.

1398
02:34:55,850 --> 02:34:57,737
And where is your court?

1399
02:34:58,346 --> 02:35:05,024
Wherever there is
'Shahenshah' (the Emperor). . .

1400
02:35:06,026 --> 02:35:07,913
. . .there is a court.

1401
02:35:08,330 --> 02:35:11,112
And this court wllI
not be adjourned. . .

1402
02:35:11,178 --> 02:35:13,993
. . .tllI the book of your
crime is not opened and read.

1403
02:35:53,962 --> 02:35:57,759
''Brave men llke him are few:

1404
02:36:01,642 --> 02:36:04,642
''Brave men llke him are few''

1405
02:36:05,161 --> 02:36:08,707
''Who break chains of
crime and injustice''

1406
02:36:11,242 --> 02:36:14,406
''And get things they set after''

1407
02:36:14,474 --> 02:36:18,248
''His hands are so powerfuI''

1408
02:36:38,442 --> 02:36:40,329
What is all this?

1409
02:36:43,561 --> 02:36:49,541
I have dragged the man
you had acquitted, Judge.

1410
02:36:54,698 --> 02:36:57,218
You have acquitted him of murder.

1411
02:36:58,602 --> 02:37:00,489
But I wllI prove it to you
that there isn't a crime. . .

1412
02:37:00,554 --> 02:37:02,342
. . . which he has not committed.

1413
02:37:03,178 --> 02:37:05,065
. . .or had his friends commit.

1414
02:37:16,618 --> 02:37:18,341
Who are you?

1415
02:37:18,442 --> 02:37:22,817
I am greater. . . than he is.

1416
02:37:24,298 --> 02:37:26,185
My name is Shahenshah.

1417
02:37:27,017 --> 02:37:29,286
By profession I am a
Judge llke you are.

1418
02:37:30,538 --> 02:37:34,662
Who makes his own Iaw,
apprehends his criminaIs. . .

1419
02:37:34,730 --> 02:37:38,505
. . . hears their cases and
passes the verdict himseIf!

1420
02:37:41,578 --> 02:37:43,465
This is contempt of court!

1421
02:37:43,658 --> 02:37:45,480
I know, that this is
contempt of court.

1422
02:37:46,473 --> 02:37:51,875
I aIso know that he has used
the wrong means to taIk.

1423
02:37:52,874 --> 02:37:56,671
But what couId be
worse for a court. . .

1424
02:37:56,746 --> 02:38:01,480
. . .than justice being incompIete
and the truth being suppressed?

1425
02:38:02,793 --> 02:38:07,550
I think, it wllI be unjust
if we do not hear him.

1426
02:38:08,553 --> 02:38:11,237
Before punishing you for
contempt of court, . . .

1427
02:38:11,306 --> 02:38:14,121
. . .the court, on its
responsibllity, . . .

1428
02:38:14,186 --> 02:38:17,001
. . . gives you a chance to speak!

1429
02:38:33,194 --> 02:38:36,358
Then, hear a case which was
presented in your court.

1430
02:38:37,994 --> 02:38:41,223
And you had sentenced an
innocent pollce inspector. . .

1431
02:38:41,289 --> 02:38:45,959
. . .to three months imprisonment
for accepting a bribe.

1432
02:38:46,570 --> 02:38:49,090
How can you say, that the
Inspector was innocent?

1433
02:38:50,089 --> 02:38:51,977
Ask yourseIf.

1434
02:38:53,290 --> 02:38:56,137
Ask your Iost conscience
and your asIeep souI.

1435
02:38:57,450 --> 02:38:59,392
. . .which is not yet awake.

1436
02:39:10,249 --> 02:39:12,137
If you stllI do not remember. . .

1437
02:39:14,089 --> 02:39:16,456
. . . then Iook into
this oId widow's eyes.

1438
02:39:17,929 --> 02:39:20,133
Her young husband
hanged himseIf to death.

1439
02:39:21,450 --> 02:39:23,970
And Ieft her all aIone.

1440
02:39:25,609 --> 02:39:29,733
The rains came
and went in this city.

1441
02:39:31,050 --> 02:39:33,570
But this widow's tears
couId not be controlled.

1442
02:39:35,530 --> 02:39:40,615
The scars on her face are due to
the mark Ieft by your verdict. . .

1443
02:39:40,682 --> 02:39:43,496
. . .which was bllnd and deaf!

1444
02:39:50,442 --> 02:39:55,199
Your deaf ear did not
even hear her testimony.

1445
02:39:56,202 --> 02:39:58,089
Who wanted to tell you that. . .

1446
02:39:59,561 --> 02:40:01,765
. . . two bags were
exchanged on J. K.'s orders.

1447
02:40:03,082 --> 02:40:06,726
One bag contained the Iayout
of the bank robbery. . .

1448
02:40:07,562 --> 02:40:09,602
. . .and the secret
recording by J. K. . . .

1449
02:40:10,698 --> 02:40:13,545
. . . between him and the
bank manager, Mr. Mathur.

1450
02:40:17,322 --> 02:40:21,119
''As usuaI, your bank wllI open
at 1 0 O'cIock in the morning''

1451
02:40:22,122 --> 02:40:25,438
''At exactIy 1 2 O'cIock,
it wllI be Iooted''

1452
02:40:26,122 --> 02:40:28,009
''- Looted?
- Yes, Iooted''.

1453
02:40:29,002 --> 02:40:32,166
''The thieves wllI Ioot all
the money from the bank''.

1454
02:40:32,682 --> 02:40:33,609
''Add. . .''

1455
02:40:39,817 --> 02:40:41,704
Tell me, J. K. , is this
your voice or not?

1456
02:40:46,057 --> 02:40:49,854
Answer or I wllI shut
your voice forever!

1457
02:40:53,257 --> 02:40:56,573
Yes. . . it is my voice.

1458
02:41:08,042 --> 02:41:10,016
And now say in that
beautifuI voice, . . .

1459
02:41:11,817 --> 02:41:17,534
. . .whether you had ordered
for Julle's death or not.

1460
02:41:19,657 --> 02:41:20,585
I had.

1461
02:41:22,537 --> 02:41:29,510
That poor Iady tried to escape
your men all her llfe. . .

1462
02:41:29,737 --> 02:41:31,428
. . .to save her innocent daughter.

1463
02:41:32,777 --> 02:41:38,822
Her daughter was broken into
pieces by hunger and poverty. . .

1464
02:41:39,657 --> 02:41:40,901
. . .and even became a thief.

1465
02:41:42,985 --> 02:41:45,833
When that thief encountered you
for the first time in a hoteI, . . .

1466
02:41:48,457 --> 02:41:54,174
. . .you had said that you wanted
to drink BIack Dog whisky.

1467
02:41:55,657 --> 02:41:58,973
For when you see a
white butterfIy. . .

1468
02:41:59,977 --> 02:42:03,774
. . . Many bIack dogs in
your bIood start barking!

1469
02:42:05,065 --> 02:42:09,059
How. . .do you know. . . all this?

1470
02:42:09,865 --> 02:42:15,299
I am aware because I know. . .

1471
02:42:20,617 --> 02:42:22,504
. . . how to collar bIack dogs!

1472
02:42:24,617 --> 02:42:30,662
Today, I wllI remove all
the bIack dogs within you.

1473
02:42:32,521 --> 02:42:36,831
And Ieave them to
attack your own fIesh.

1474
02:42:37,034 --> 02:42:42,598
We wllI demand justice from J. K. !

1475
02:42:54,154 --> 02:42:56,041
Who are these peopIe
and why are they here?

1476
02:42:56,457 --> 02:42:58,115
They are the peopIe. . .

1477
02:43:01,257 --> 02:43:07,880
. . .who were ensIaved by
outside ruIe for 200 years.

1478
02:43:09,993 --> 02:43:11,400
And who are llving in the mercy. . .

1479
02:43:12,394 --> 02:43:14,760
. . .of imposter llke J. K.
since the Iast 40 years.

1480
02:43:17,194 --> 02:43:18,121
What about these poor peopIe?

1481
02:43:19,433 --> 02:43:21,473
After being ensIaved for years. . .

1482
02:43:22,954 --> 02:43:24,644
. . .they had seen a wonderfuI
dream of independence.

1483
02:43:28,874 --> 02:43:33,030
And sometimes,
Ieaders llke him auctioned it!

1484
02:43:37,449 --> 02:43:41,573
And officers llke him made
it llke a whore in a brotheI!

1485
02:43:42,089 --> 02:43:45,504
Do you know What a
big crime it is. . .

1486
02:43:45,609 --> 02:43:46,853
. . .to put your hand on the
uniform of a pollceman.

1487
02:43:47,849 --> 02:43:50,304
Where have you worn a
pollce officer's uniform?

1488
02:43:51,689 --> 02:43:56,446
It is a cIoth draped around
the corpse of your conscience!

1489
02:44:06,570 --> 02:44:09,417
A pollce uniform does proud
on an officer llke Mr. AsIam.

1490
02:44:10,889 --> 02:44:13,344
Who is a cIassic exampIe of duty.

1491
02:44:16,457 --> 02:44:17,886
Look into his eyes.

1492
02:44:19,146 --> 02:44:22,942
And remember the day when
J. K.'s truck of drugs. . .

1493
02:44:23,850 --> 02:44:24,864
. . .was going to come to Bombay.

1494
02:44:25,770 --> 02:44:28,071
And you had sent
Mr. AsIam to Chowpatty. . .

1495
02:44:28,138 --> 02:44:30,472
. . .for the security
of this Ieaders.

1496
02:44:34,441 --> 02:44:37,191
What wllI happen to
this country, Judge?

1497
02:44:39,145 --> 02:44:41,512
Where IowIy peopIe llke
him become Ieaders.

1498
02:44:42,505 --> 02:44:45,156
And thieves llke him,
the city's pollce.

1499
02:44:47,785 --> 02:44:51,877
The Iaw of the country
was once llke a king.

1500
02:44:52,585 --> 02:44:55,335
But peopIe llke J. K.
and officers llke him. . . .

1501
02:44:55,401 --> 02:44:56,611
. . . have made it a roadside beggar!

1502
02:44:57,385 --> 02:45:03,102
I appeaI to you to Iook at
editor Sallm's case intentIy.

1503
02:45:04,105 --> 02:45:06,080
I know that the paper
presented to the court. . .

1504
02:45:06,985 --> 02:45:11,263
. . . had the bIood of some
animaI and not a human being!

1505
02:45:24,361 --> 02:45:29,926
Tell me, where you have
hidden the actuaI newspaper?

1506
02:45:31,561 --> 02:45:33,765
Answer, or your death
wllI be publlshed. . .

1507
02:45:33,833 --> 02:45:35,207
. . . in the newspapers tomorrow.

1508
02:45:35,881 --> 02:45:38,565
Forgive me, Shahenshah.
I have chlldren.

1509
02:45:38,889 --> 02:45:41,922
The one who was murdered was
aIso a son of some father.

1510
02:45:42,922 --> 02:45:45,289
He too was going to be a father.

1511
02:45:47,241 --> 02:45:48,169
Now tell me.

1512
02:45:49,161 --> 02:45:53,918
Are you going to remove the
paper, or shall I kllI you?

1513
02:45:54,761 --> 02:45:55,841
I wllI give you.

1514
02:46:10,762 --> 02:46:11,841
Here it is, Judge.

1515
02:46:14,121 --> 02:46:19,685
The newspaper containing Sallm
Mohammed's bIood is before you.

1516
02:46:23,433 --> 02:46:26,019
And the fingerprint of the
murderer, J. K. , is present.

1517
02:46:34,857 --> 02:46:37,857
Evidences of a murder
are so easlly changed.

1518
02:46:39,497 --> 02:46:42,148
And the footprints of the murderer
are wiped off, Your, Honour.

1519
02:46:44,297 --> 02:46:49,054
Innocent officers llke Srivastav
hang themseIves to death.

1520
02:46:50,217 --> 02:46:53,381
And fearIess peopIe llke
Sallm Mohammed are kllIed.

1521
02:46:55,817 --> 02:47:00,574
And murderers llke
J. K. are acquitted!

1522
02:47:03,977 --> 02:47:09,214
But you wllI not be acquitted
in Shahenshah's court.

1523
02:47:12,521 --> 02:47:18,816
The consequence you wllI face'll
be a Iesson for the criminaIs.

1524
02:47:21,033 --> 02:47:22,855
And such an exampIe for others. . .

1525
02:47:24,553 --> 02:47:27,869
. . .that its story wllI be
heard and toId for years.

1526
02:47:33,673 --> 02:47:37,951
After this, the hands of the
pollcemen wllI not shake. . .

1527
02:47:38,025 --> 02:47:39,683
. . .whlle arresting criminaIs.

1528
02:47:40,393 --> 02:47:42,760
Nor wllI the hands of the judges
shiver whlle writing a verdict.

1529
02:47:44,521 --> 02:47:47,555
When this wllI
happen, your honour. . .

1530
02:47:48,937 --> 02:47:51,871
. . .then the Iost crown wllI be
restored on the head of justice.

1531
02:47:52,873 --> 02:47:55,873
And the dreams of these poor
peopIe wllI become allve again.

1532
02:47:57,673 --> 02:48:01,765
A reaI dream of independence. . .
. . .a reaI dream of justice!

1533
02:48:05,353 --> 02:48:06,281
Move!

1534
02:48:07,273 --> 02:48:10,339
- My daughter!
- Nobody dare move!

1535
02:48:17,769 --> 02:48:18,697
Move!

1536
02:48:19,689 --> 02:48:20,617
Stop!

1537
02:48:25,929 --> 02:48:28,776
Ask your men to move
back, Inspector AsIam!

1538
02:48:29,577 --> 02:48:32,773
If anybody moves then.
I wllI kllI ShaIu!

1539
02:48:33,417 --> 02:48:36,450
J. K. , my target is on your head.

1540
02:48:36,969 --> 02:48:38,693
If you shoot ShaIu, . . .

1541
02:48:39,049 --> 02:48:42,694
. . .then I shall empty this
revoIver on your head!

1542
02:51:58,217 --> 02:52:03,367
Save me, Shahenshah!
Save me!

1543
02:52:05,001 --> 02:52:06,725
Accept your crime.

1544
02:52:07,977 --> 02:52:10,344
Say that you had
made faIse charges. . .

1545
02:52:10,409 --> 02:52:12,264
. . .of bribery on
inspector Srivastav.

1546
02:52:13,417 --> 02:52:17,541
Say that you murdered editor,
Sallm Mohammed- say it!

1547
02:52:20,457 --> 02:52:24,254
Yes, I did.

1548
02:52:27,465 --> 02:52:32,899
I. . .accept all my crimes.

1549
02:52:35,337 --> 02:52:36,897
You have pIeaded gullty. . . .

1550
02:52:38,697 --> 02:52:40,584
And Shahenshah has
adjourned his court.

1551
02:52:45,417 --> 02:52:47,556
Look at this rope intentIy, J. K.

1552
02:52:49,257 --> 02:52:52,104
You'll see Inspector Srivastav's
corpse hanging from it!

1553
02:52:54,057 --> 02:52:58,814
You wllI see a heIpIess
widow. . . . . . a son.

1554
02:53:01,065 --> 02:53:04,742
After dying, a father's
corpse aIways questioned. . .

1555
02:53:04,809 --> 02:53:06,434
. . . his son for years. . .

1556
02:53:08,233 --> 02:53:10,273
. . .that your father's
kllIer is yet allve.

1557
02:53:11,433 --> 02:53:13,440
Why has he not yet been hanged?

1558
02:53:16,937 --> 02:53:18,115
Who are you?

1559
02:53:19,113 --> 02:53:24,677
Inspector Srivastav's son,
Inspector Vijaykumar Srivastav.

1560
02:53:34,600 --> 02:53:37,317
A pollceman's uniform
was not enough. . .

1561
02:53:39,113 --> 02:53:40,323
. . .to reach criminaIs llke you.

1562
02:53:41,993 --> 02:53:44,164
Therefore, I had to wear
Shahenshah's attire.

1563
02:53:46,793 --> 02:53:50,884
A son has accompllshed
what his father couId not.

1564
02:53:53,513 --> 02:53:55,073
I wllI throw this rope to you, J. K.

1565
02:53:57,193 --> 02:53:58,436
HoId it and cllmb up.

1566
02:55:33,384 --> 02:55:38,949
''In the darkness of the night
in the deserted streets''

1567
02:55:40,904 --> 02:55:47,101
''In the darkness of the night
in the deserted streets''

1568
02:55:48,584 --> 02:55:51,901
''To wipe away every crime''

1569
02:55:52,424 --> 02:56:01,917
''There comes a Messiah
Whom peopIe call as Shahenshah''
