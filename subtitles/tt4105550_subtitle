1
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,917
Smoking is injurious for your health.

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,125
Smoking causes cancer.

3
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,458
Smoking is injurious for your health.

4
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,042
Smoking causes cancer.

5
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,667
With the dust of the
lotus feet of Sri Gurudeva...

6
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,833
I clean the mirror of my mind.

7
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,333
I narrate the scared glory of Sri Ram...

8
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:20,625
who bestows the four fruits of life.

9
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,583
Considering myself as ignorant,
I meditate on you Lord Hanuman.

10
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:31,417
Bestow on me strength,
wisdom and knowledge...

11
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:36,667
and remove my
afflictions and blemishes.

12
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,958
Tanu!

13
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,958
Tanu!

14
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:43,917
Do you hear me?

15
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,583
Do you hear me?

16
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,500
Wake up, it's late.

17
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,208
See what's the news headlines today.

18
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,208
Vajpayee's knee pain has aggravated.
Did you hear?

19
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:58,167
Doctors are coming...
- Arthritis.

20
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,708
Doctors are coming from abroad.

21
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,750
C'mon wake up. It's late.

22
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,917
I'm getting late. Wake up.
- Oh no!

23
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,499
Please wake up. I've got tea for you.

24
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,976
Let's not talk about pain, drink tea.

25
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,458
Wake up. C'mon wake up.

26
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,458
Did you add sugar to tea?
- What?

27
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,792
Did you add sugar to tea?

28
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:19,250
Haven't you read in newspapers that...

29
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,792
it's poisonous to
have sugar with tea? C'mon.

30
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,684
Don't start giving me
lectures early in the morning.

31
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,083
It's irritating.

32
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,601
I won't have tea without sugar.

33
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,625
Drink it, you'll like.

34
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,167
C'mon hold the cup of tea. C'mon.

35
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,792
Oh no! The tea is horrible.

36
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,292
I won't drink it.

37
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:52,708
You'll get used to it.

38
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,726
You're going back to bed. C'mon get up.
- Leave me.

39
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,833
Get up.
- I don't like this.

40
00:05:56,292 --> 00:06:00,042
Listen, you'll get used to
it if you drink it daily. Drink it.

41
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,917
You'll get me habituated to poison also.

42
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,458
Evil man!

43
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,625
Don't use abusive words
early in the morning, Tanu?

44
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,542
Did I utter abusive words?

45
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,542
So, I'm abusive?

46
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,208
Did I utter abusive words?

47
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,208
Rogue! Get lost from here.

48
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,083
You don't have to do anything for me.

49
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:14,792
I'll make tea for myself.

50
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,833
How can I give you
poison with my own hands?

51
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,542
Good morning.

52
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,583
What's up, Mithilesh sir?

53
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,833
How is your geography class going?

54
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,792
Forget about geography class.

55
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,101
I know a dirty joke to share.
Shall I share it with you?

56
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,333
It's going to ruin my day.
- No. No.

57
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,042
You'll feel fresh.

58
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,167
The maid Kantabai...
- It's okay.

59
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,934
Wouldn't you like to know the
body parts Kantabai loved scratching?

60
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,750
I can guess. There aren't too
many places to scratch in the body.

61
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,667
Right. - I'll share the joke during
lunch break. Remind me, Anjani sir.

62
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,917
Putra.
- What?

63
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,083
Forget it.

64
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,958
So, you've started chatting.

65
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,125
Great!

66
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,250
We're talking to the mayor of
Reykjavik about the volcanic eruption...

67
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,000
that has stopped
international traffic.

68
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,958
What are your thoughts on that topic?

69
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:39,125
Well, considering the long
history of volcanic eruptions...

70
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,458
on this island this
is but a minor event.

71
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:45,167
And as you can see there is no
immediate effect on city of Reykjavik.

72
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,708
Actually we can't complain
about the calamity.

73
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,458
But there are people travelling
from Barcelona to Yera by taxi.

74
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,875
You see this is deeply regretted.

75
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,518
However, I would really like
to apologize for any inconvenience...

76
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,833
caused by our volcano
to travelers around the globe.

77
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:04,292
I would like to invite you for
a holiday stay to enjoy the oneness...

78
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,292
of this unique and beautiful island.

79
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,333
I would say do the same as we do.

80
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,875
Accept the unpredictable, be
with the inevitable and enjoy yourself.

81
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,500
This was Tina Lawson interviewing
the mayor of Reykjavik.

82
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,292
Now back to the studio.

83
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,434
Sir, all the teachers are
staging a protest outside...

84
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,167
the principal's room.
- What? Why?

85
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,333
Go and keep the book on my table.

86
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:41,458
Okay.

87
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,292
No. No. What does this mean?

88
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,893
This is an intense and important matter.

89
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:49,167
Don't you think you're over-reacting?

90
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,875
Don't you remember that we're
asked to make our passports...

91
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,291
for Singapore trip last time?
- Right.

92
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:57,167
But, nothing materialized.

93
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,306
Well, I agree that we're not
lucky enough to enjoy a Singapore trip.

94
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,380
But, you could've at
least taken us to Durgapur.

95
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,667
Mithilesh sir, you're well
aware why the trip didn't happen.

96
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,625
Only five teachers agreed
to be a part of the trip. - Okay.

97
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,417
It's useless to dig into the past.

98
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,601
They're deducting money from our
salary and you aren't taking any action.

99
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,125
Will you sit idle?

100
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,792
The bard is paying half the amount.

101
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,500
We're taking only the half
the amount from all of you.

102
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,958
We're offering it at a subsidized rate.

103
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,958
Forget the subsidized rate.
We know everything. Useless!

104
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,083
Calm down.

105
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,833
It's a matter of just 700 rupees.

106
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,212
It'll take only two years
time to pay the amount.

107
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,000
After that the computer
will be your property. Isn't it?

108
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,833
This is ridiculous!

109
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,291
The board is forcing
us to buy computers...

110
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,625
and we've no right to protest.

111
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:53,958
If the board sends a circular in future
that we've to wear red shoes to school...

112
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,518
or it'll deduct our salary
then should we wear red shoes to school?

113
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,542
No! No!
- Great!

114
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,292
Do you want to wear red shoes to school?

115
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,875
Anjaniputra, times are changing.

116
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,958
Do you think you can stop
the flow of the changing time...

117
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,500
by staging protests
in a village school?

118
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,527
Think about it and then answer me.

119
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:18,583
Anjani sir,
we had a bad day at school today.

120
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,768
Your coaching class
is doing good business.

121
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,393
Forget about the coaching class.
Forget it.

122
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,000
Let me share the Kantabai joke.

123
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,018
I assure that you'll
feel fresh after hearing it.

124
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,642
I know that you aren't
going to spare me.

125
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,667
I can't say it loudly.
Bring your ears close to me.

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Listen to me...

127
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,292
Does your one stand?

128
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,208
What?
- Does your one stand?

129
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,583
Bye.

130
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:58,708
Hey volcanic hot boy!
Now I know why you're so volcanic...

131
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:03,833
because you come from
land of volcano Iceland.

132
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,583
I found out who you really
are fun TV in an interview.

133
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,667
At night when you're hunting for women,

134
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,542
You cover your face with a mask.

135
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,250
But the mask does not cover your mole.

136
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:30,708
Who could've imagined that you,
the manic is really the mayor...

137
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:34,125
of the city of Reykjavik in Iceland?

138
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,708
A very important man.

139
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,042
If I told the world what
the mayor does at night...

140
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,083
where will your career
and your reputation go?

141
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:50,500
You'll be finished, Mr. Mayor. Forever.

142
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,458
Your life will go up in flames
like the volcanoes of Iceland.

143
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,000
Your secret and your life
are in my hands, Mr. Mayor.

144
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:05,208
Remember, your game is over, Hot Boy.

145
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:10,792
Hi!

146
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,958
What happened? Serve food.
- Coming.

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,792
You're always so hungry.

148
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:57,958
Here you go.

149
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,500
All the teachers have
to be computer literate now.

150
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,417
What?

151
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,833
We've to learn about a machine,
the computer.

152
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,000
That's good.

153
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,208
The question papers will be sent by e-mail.
- By what?

154
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,958
It'll come in the computer.

155
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,184
Will you teach me how to use a computer?

156
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,083
We've to set the question
papers in computer.

157
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,042
We've to explain everything.

158
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,083
There'll be computers
in every household.

159
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:36,583
They're going to deduct
700 rupees from our salary for it.

160
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,833
Just imagine!

161
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,375
One. Two. Three. Four.

162
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,792
I'll reach 99 if I get a two.
It's your turn now.

163
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,250
Mohan, you are...
- Don't say anything, Tanu.

164
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,333
I don't like it.

165
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,208
Do you think I'll betray the
work for which I'm getting paid...

166
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,875
and that which
helps me run my expenses?

167
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,583
Do you want me to start tuition classes?

168
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,208
My conscience doesn't support it.

169
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,417
That's it. Then why should
you think about it so much.

170
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,583
We'll spend the rest
of our life like this.

171
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,458
It's your turn.

172
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,417
What are you scared of, Mohan?

173
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:38,792
Education has lost its importance.

174
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,292
You're crazy.

175
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:53,958
A teacher like you was scared just like
you before the arrival of the reed pen.

176
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,542
You shouldn't be scared.

177
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,583
Aren't you Hanuman?

178
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,333
Do you still love me?
- Yes, I do.

179
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:22,917
Most of the times the things we use,
the things we can easily understand...

180
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:28,750
or the things that help
us in our life is the truth for us.

181
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,375
And exactly by the law of probability...

182
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,875
it is not the
truth for somebody else.

183
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,458
Did you understand?

184
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:44,667
Tanu! Tanu!
- Coming.

185
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,208
Can you hear me?
- Coming.

186
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:50,833
What happened?

187
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,768
I can come only when
there are commercial breaks.

188
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,250
What happened?
- This is not difficult at all.

189
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,125
It's a typewriter machine
combined with television.

190
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,167
I learned using the
typewriter in my childhood.

191
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,167
My speed was quite good.

192
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,858
But I've lost practice now.
Doesn't matter, will practice it.

193
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,417
You can practice it, my dear.

194
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,583
But after the daily soap ends
we'll go to sleep. - Yes.

195
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,208
You've school tomorrow.
Hope you remember.

196
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,833
Come to bed soon.
- Okay.

197
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,250
Tanu!

198
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,917
Tanu!

199
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:46,812
She didn't switch on the lights today.

200
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,375
Tanu!

201
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:52,917
Tanu!

202
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,583
Tanu!

203
00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:00,417
Tanu... what happened, Tanushree?

204
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,042
I haven't seen a selfish
man like you in my life, Mon.

205
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,000
Do you know how I feel at times?

206
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,500
I can't tolerate it anymore.

207
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:16,250
You've time for your things.
How can you forget me, Mon?

208
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,625
Just a minute.
- Mon!

209
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,667
Panchu...
- Uncle, I'm not a martyr.

210
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,667
I'm tired of doing
the rounds of your house.

211
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,226
People are not ready to pay
unless we cut off the cable lines...

212
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,184
and they're not able to watch
the daily soaps. - Right.

213
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,458
Now you've understood.
- Yes.

214
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,542
You had to finally
come here for your wife.

215
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,625
Please forget the past.

216
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,976
You're like my younger brother.

217
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,207
Should I sacrifice my life for you?

218
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,833
Don't I've to earn?
Don't I have a heart?

219
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,291
Why don't you understand that
I'll be ruined if you don't do it.

220
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,625
I'll go tomorrow morning.

221
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,018
Please don't do this.
- Hey!

222
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,268
Dear brother, you don't understand...

223
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,042
My wife will leave me and go.

224
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,476
Please come with me, please.
- Hey!

225
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,292
Please come.
- What a problem!

226
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,000
Please come.
- I need to take my bag.

227
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,625
Please come. Come.

228
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,083
Panchu...
- Yes.

229
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,583
I'll pay you the dues
of the remaining three months...

230
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,542
tomorrow morning. Okay?

231
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,583
What happened, Panchu?

232
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,667
Why did you get down? What happened?

233
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,958
You carry on, I'll come.
- No. No. Don't do this.

234
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,750
Don't do this.
You're like my brother. Come.

235
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,958
Not at all.
I don't even spare my father.

236
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,291
The Bongs aren't ready to
[ay unless we take strict action.

237
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,208
Why are you shouting?

238
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,750
You're shouting so loudly.
Speak softly. Softly.

239
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,208
I'll go.
- No. Please don't do that. Listen to me.

240
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,333
Listen, I don't have enough money now.

241
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:39,000
Look here...
I have... I have 452... let me check...

242
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:45,792
453. I've 453 rupees. Keep it.

243
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:48,000
No, I can't accept it.
- Please keep it.

244
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,417
You've a total due
of 975 with late fees.

245
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,333
A total of 975 rupees.

246
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,458
What can I do?
I don't have so much money right now.

247
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,708
I'll withdraw money from bank
tomorrow morning and give it to you.

248
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,750
I promise you.

249
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:03,042
Then your wife will watch
her daily soap tomorrow.

250
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,542
No. No, Panchu.
No. No. I can't let you go.

251
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,000
My wife will be very angry.

252
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,249
My wife will scold me.
- It's your problem.

253
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,931
My wife will scold me.
- It's your problem.

254
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:11,958
I know it's my problem.

255
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,792
You shouldn't treat me as what?
What? C'mon, tell me.

256
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,167
A martyr.
- Yes. Correct. Correct.

257
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,833
I don't have money right now.
Please believe me.

258
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,583
No... no...

259
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:30,750
My dear brother, my mother gifted
this to me after I did my matriculation.

260
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:35,292
It's an expensive watch.
An expensive watch by HMT.

261
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,375
My mother has expired.

262
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,958
I take care of it like my child.

263
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,375
Don't take it, brother.

264
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,833
"Sister, your brother-in-law is crazy."

265
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:48,292
Don't d this. It's my mother's gift.

266
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,333
Did the picture come, uncle?
- No. No. not yet.

267
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,458
I'm rotating it. See if it's okay.

268
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,125
The picture came but it's gone again.

269
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,750
It's condition is just like you.

270
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,875
Check this.

271
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,167
Yes, it has come.
Hold on to it. Hold it.

272
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,750
The picture has come. Hold it there.

273
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,583
Panchu, hold it there.

274
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,875
Hope the picture is clear.

275
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:15,167
Yes, it is.
There's your favourite channel.

276
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:20,542
Just before 7:30... just before 7:30,
your favourite channel is back.

277
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,500
Panchu...
- Shall I get down?

278
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,167
Yes, get down.

279
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,542
Enjoy.

280
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,792
Disgusting!

281
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,458
I hope you'll return the
watch after I give you your dues.

282
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,667
Sir... did you buy a computer?

283
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,750
No. Gave me.

284
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,208
Your bag. Your bag.

285
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:50,500
You'll definitely need internet
connection now that you've a computer.

286
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,917
I don't need much in life.

287
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,167
What are you saying, sir?

288
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,833
It's the time of www.facebook.com.

289
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,333
You seem to be so excited about it.

290
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,958
Internet is like excretion.

291
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:16,958
How? - You can clearly make out
from a person's face...

292
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,500
if his stomach got cleared or not.

293
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,337
You can also make out
the ones with constipation.

294
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,625
No, brother. I don't need it.

295
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,792
I went through a lot to
get the cable connection back.

296
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,796
I had to give away the
watch gifted by my mother.

297
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:31,916
I don't want anything else.

298
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,833
You may leave now. It's late.

299
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,309
There's a new scheme that
gives you internet free of cost...

300
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,708
for three months.

301
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,167
If you don't like it you
can disconnect the connection.

302
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,417
No charge.

303
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:43,875
Isn't it a good scheme?

304
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,958
Free?
- Absolutely free for three months.

305
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:18,958
If I told the world what
the mayor does at night...

306
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,833
where will your career
and your reputation go?

307
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:30,042
You'll be finished, Mr. mayor. Forever.

308
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,667
Oh yes! If I meet...

309
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,000
Hey Anjani sir...
- Not again.

310
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,208
Anjani is Hanuman's mother's name.

311
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:45,375
What a problem!
Hang up or how will I bring the man.

312
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes. hang up.

313
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:48,833
Sorry, sir.

314
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,333
I've got a very bad headache today.

315
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:54,583
Please spare me from
the Kantabai jokes today.

316
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,458
You always underestimate me.

317
00:23:56,542 --> 00:24:00,542
I had a new joke today.
A Punjabi one. But, forget it.

318
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,125
I need your help.

319
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,042
Can you spare some time?

320
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,083
You need my help?
- Yes, your help.

321
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,167
What help do you need?

322
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:11,958
She's my wife Mrs. Khastagir.
Mention that I'm your ex-wife.

323
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:17,583
She was my junior in
Vidyasagar high school.

324
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,125
Political Science.

325
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,958
Back then I didn't know that
I shouldn't marry the person I like.

326
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,625
So, the obvious happened.

327
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,917
My wife became my
ex-wife after some time.

328
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,000
But, she's intelligent.

329
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,792
She has invested her father's
money in different things...

330
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:40,208
and have multiplied the
amount by tickling people. -Tickling?

331
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:44,625
Did you ever hear of
the business of tickling feet? - No.

332
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,167
Mit, it's Thai spa.
- Yes.

333
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,976
Sometimes she tickles her customers
till thigh so it's called Thai spa.

334
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Disgusting!

335
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:55,708
Actually I've no feeling
when anyone tickles me.

336
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,375
It's like that since childhood.

337
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,625
Don't panic.

338
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,958
Mrs. Khastagir has started a new business.
- Business?

339
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:10,917
She wants to start a
resort around Hasulibagan.

340
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:14,958
The rich people from Kolkata will
come here to get themselves tickled.

341
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:17,250
You're really disgusting.

342
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,958
I wish to start a wellness resort.

343
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:23,583
How can I help, Mithilesh sir?
- Simple.

344
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:29,458
Mrs. Khastagir has bought
a lot of land around Hasulibagan.

345
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:30,833
You know what usually happens.

346
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,000
When she got stuck she thought of me.

347
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:35,167
Life is nothing but business.

348
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:41,417
You've an agricultural land
at the Hasulibagan crossroad.

349
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,833
Mrs. Khastagir wants to buy it.

350
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,583
She'll pay a good price for it.

351
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,667
I told her that Anjani sir...
- Anjaniputra.

352
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,500
Is a down to earth, simple man.

353
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,463
I told her not to cheat
you like you cheated me.

354
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,542
She'll pay a good price for it. Sell it.

355
00:25:56,917 --> 00:26:00,417
Mithilesh sir, how can I sell
something that doesn't belong to me?

356
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:04,375
As usual wrong information.

357
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,167
Wait, let me talk.

358
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:11,208
It belongs to my father's younger uncle.

359
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:12,417
It's an ancestral land.

360
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,583
It mentioned in the
holy scriptures that...

361
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:17,583
it's a sin to sell ancestral land.
I can't sell it.

362
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,125
What a good idea!

363
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,500
You answered brilliantly.

364
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,167
What are you talking about?

365
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,583
About the mention of scriptures.
That was a good point.

366
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,125
I told you that nothing can tickle me.

367
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,000
You've taught Mrs.
Khastagir a good lesson.

368
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,208
That was a good one. Good decision.

369
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:39,875
Bye.
- Take care.

370
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,583
We'll meet tomorrow morning.

371
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:10,708
ANJU. Anju.

372
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,833
Isn't the name perfect, sir?

373
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:15,417
Anju?
- Anju.

374
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:18,792
I can't make Anjaniputra Anju.
- Why?

375
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,792
Just think of it.

376
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,250
The board will send
question papers to me.

377
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,375
The name should have some weight.

378
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,083
Do something.

379
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,750
Write this one.
- What?

380
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:32,917
Anjaniputra probability @hotmail.com.

381
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,917
The computer doesn't accept
such a big name. - Oh!

382
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,625
It'll go out of the box.

383
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:39,934
The computer doesn't
accept such a big name.

384
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:40,875
It doesn't accept such a big name?
- No.

385
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,917
Panchu... - Yes.
- have dinner with us tonight.

386
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:48,042
Okay. What have you cooked today? Chicken?
- No.

387
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,208
I cooked leafy greens today.

388
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,291
Oh! No non-vegetarian food?
Egg or anything else?

389
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:55,125
We eat vegetarian food on Tuesdays.
- Okay.

390
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll have dinner tomorrow.

391
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,500
Sir is taking a lot of time.

392
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,375
He's stuck at email.

393
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,750
Please check if they'll accept...

394
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,292

probability@htmail.com

395
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,125
Please check.
You can do it.

396
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,208
If you try, you can do it.
They'll accept the name.

397
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:15,208
You're going to sacrifice my life.

398
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,583
Tell me the spelling.
- Yes.

399
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:18,833
Write it down.

400
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:25,833
A. A for Anjani. A-N-J-A.

401
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:31,458
Google.com.
- Oh! Google.

402
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:34,417
Now you can search anything you want.

403
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,250
Search? Search what?

404
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,875
Wait. wait and watch
what I share with you.

405
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:49,042
Indiasex.com.
- What's that?

406
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:58,083
You can sit at your home
and watch what ladies are doing.

407
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,958
Watch? Watch what?
- Wait.

408
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,458
Hey! Hey! Close it. Close it.

409
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:09,832
Sister-in -law will hear you.

410
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,000
Close it. Close it.

411
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,083
What are you doing?

412
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,083
Are you a celibate?
- I...

413
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,833
How will you excrete
if you don't have purgative?

414
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,417
Every day I...
- Keep quite.

415
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:21,708
Scoundrel!

416
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,708
I've downloaded google.

417
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:28,083
Click on it. Search anything and watch.
- Okay.

418
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:29,542
Okay?

419
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,417
Sir...

420
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,167
Here it is. Google chat. C'mon chat.

421
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,792
I'll chat with google?

422
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,500
Chat with google or googly anything?

423
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,042
There are lots of girls and boys.

424
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,625
By god's grace you're quite handsome.

425
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,958
Keep trying and you'll
strike gold for sure.

426
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:00,792
Get up. get up, you rascal. Get up. Get up.
- Oh no!

427
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,292
Nonsense!

428
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,792
This one. Yes.

429
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,042
Okay?
- Yes.

430
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,750
Take this one...
- You may leave now.

431
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,598
You may leave now.
I've understood it. Go.

432
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,333
I've learned everything.

433
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,726
I'll call you if I've
any problem with cable.

434
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,042
Please leave. Leave now.

435
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,125
Rascal!

436
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:48,250
"The world is gradually
becoming smaller..."

437
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,583
"and is confined to the idiot box...

438
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,958
in our drawing rooms
by cables and satellites."

439
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,708
"We can sit at home and
connect with the entire world."

440
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:10,458
"All the national and international
boundaries have been erased."

441
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,750
"Have you ever given it a thought?"

442
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:35,333
"The stars are light
years away from us."

443
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:40,375
"We gradually get
distanced further away."

444
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,958
Tanu, wake up. wake up.

445
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:44,667
Tanu, cockroach. Cockroach.
- Where?

446
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,750
Listen to me.
- Oh no!

447
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,083
Not here. Not in our house.

448
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:48,833
Listen to me.

449
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:52,750
Have you ever heard that cockroach
is a food lover? - What?

450
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,958
If you keep plain rice and fried
rice at two corners of the kitchen...

451
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:59,000
you'll notice that the
cockroach will prefer fried rice.

452
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,083
Who shared this nonsense with you?
- The computer.

453
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,767
Did you ever imagine anything like this?

454
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,250
Mon, I don't want to think about it,
I'm sleepy.

455
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,250
Listen to me.
- Ah!

456
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,333
Listen to me once.

457
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,750
If you search information
about cockroach on google...

458
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,351
.you'll get different stories about it.

459
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,625
Google was created because of cockroach.

460
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:21,167
Mon, please go from here.
I want to sleep. Disgusting!

461
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,208
Can you hear me, Tanu?
- What happened?

462
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:29,833
Humans and cockroaches...
- Again?

463
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,333
No. No.

464
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,500
This is a good one.

465
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,042
Humans and cockroaches both spend...

466
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:40,125
90% of their time
finding things here and there.

467
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,250
They search what?

468
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,250
I don't know. It's not mentioned there.

469
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,250
Then forget it my, darling.

470
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,059
You can disturb me for something else.

471
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,208
Forget about cockroaches. Go.

472
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Oh God!

473
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,542
"Series of faces come and disappear..."

474
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,875
"as the eyes glued
to television screen watch."

475
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:05,333
"Getting close to
strange unknown things."

476
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,625
"As we sit next to each other
and watch we don't watch together..."

477
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,792
"we're actually alone."

478
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,417
"A new trick to separate us."

479
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,000
Mon! Mon!

480
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,125
I'm on the terrace.

481
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,167
What are you doing up there?

482
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,375
Wait, I'm coming.

483
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,083
34 and 55 is 89.

484
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,875
Mon, what are you doing on the terrace?

485
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,167
I'm useless.
- Who told so?

486
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,000
Let's go down.

487
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,208
The computer.

488
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,542
How dare it call you useless? But why?

489
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,000
The flowers...
- Oh no!

490
00:33:56,208 --> 00:34:00,500
The leaves and the parts
of plants have a formula of growth.

491
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,667
There's Math even
in the petals of a rose.

492
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,125
A simple sequence.

493
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:09,833
I couldn't solve it even
after trying hard all night.

494
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:12,292
I'm worthless.

495
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,458
I'm supposed to have
done majors in mathematics.

496
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,083
I don't deserve a better job.
What other job could I get?

497
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,708
Mon, don't feel depressed.

498
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:25,250
I'll scold the computer. Okay?

499
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:48,833
"The stars are light
years away from us."

500
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:56,208
"We gradually get
distanced further away."

501
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,750
Let's go. C'mon, let's go.

502
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,250
Scratch my back.

503
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,583
Go down a little more.

504
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,083
Mon, will you go to bed now?

505
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,417
Come on.

506
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:42,208
So, you won't go.

507
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,958
So, you won't go?

508
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,083
Stay here. I'm going.

509
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:54,667
Scratch my back.
- Do it yourself.

510
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,458
"We don't have any role in
the business of selling dreams."

511
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:05,000
"This dazzling game is a deception."

512
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:20,000
"Let's look out through the
open windows at the streets..."

513
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,500
"where we might finds some friends."

514
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,875
"Have you ever given it a thought?"

515
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:47,792
"The stars are light
years away from us."

516
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:51,833
"We gradually get
distanced further away."

517
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,583
"Have you ever given it a thought?"

518
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,542
"The stars are light
years away from us."

519
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,125
"We gradually get
distanced further away."

520
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,875
Mon...
- Hmm...

521
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:53,250
Mon, let's go to sleep.

522
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,184
I'll go as soon as I finish
Einstein's quantum theory.

523
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,250
You can go to bed.

524
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,750
Einstein is spoiling you.

525
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,708
Don't say that. Einstein will curse you.

526
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,875
Stay busy with the computer. I'm going.

527
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,250
Hi!

528
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,417
Hello!

529
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:30,917
I'm Maria and you?

530
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:39,542
I'm Anjaniputra Sen Sharma.

531
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:46,958
Is that your name?

532
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:53,583
Yes, my good name.

533
00:38:55,375 --> 00:39:03,333
I am in Sarnyaka...
space... I made a mistake.

534
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm from Sarnakamalpur,
West Bengal, India.

535
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:22,792
And you?

536
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,333
How does it matter?

537
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:31,250
I don't understand.

538
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,875
I could be near, I could be far.

539
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,792
Are you a ghost?

540
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:43,750
Yes, I am.

541
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:49,667
You're a ghost.

542
00:39:55,583 --> 00:40:00,125
Which district are you in?

543
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,542
Oh my god!
You want to know everything. Don't you?

544
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,833
Okay.

545
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:28,083
I am... in... Reykjavik.

546
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:32,958
Reykjavik? Ray...

547
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:44,542
Is it in... 24 Parganas.

548
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,292
I don't know where that is.

549
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,000
But Reyjkavik is in Iceland.

550
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,958
You know Iceland. Don't you?

551
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,833
Iceland?

552
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,417
What's the matter Anjani sir?

553
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,542
You're in our area instead
of studying law of probability.

554
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:10,292
What are you doing here with our subject
instead of studying about probability?

555
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,333
Do you know where Iceland is,
Mithilesh sir?

556
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,292
Iceland?
- Yes.

557
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:19,375
I've heard about Greenland.
I even heard about it in my childhood.

558
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,458
No, I'm talking about Iceland.

559
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:27,167
I've heard about ice box
and ice pack and ice cream.

560
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,750
But, Iceland? No... no...

561
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,750
There's a place by that name.
- No!

562
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,291
Somebody must've given
you the wrong information.

563
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:34,917
How could I not know
about its existence?

564
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:38,042
I've a new joke to share.
It'll cheer you up.

565
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,042
You're an useless geography teacher.

566
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:44,167
God knows what you teach your students.
- What!

567
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:05,417
Get up. Come on.

568
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,042
Wait. Wait.
- No I won't allow you to sit here anymore.

569
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,893
You don't have to read
about Einstein anymore. Come.

570
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,582
You don't have to shut it down. Come.
- Okay, I'm coming.

571
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,083
Come on.
- I'm coming.

572
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,542
I'll teach you about Einstein.

573
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:11,042
Do you think there's magic in life?

574
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:13,958
Magic?

575
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:21,500
Do you know I love magic?

576
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:31,875
Once in the village
I saw a show by P C Sorcar.

577
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:38,292
I was stunned.

578
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,083
I can show you a stunt.

579
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,750
I believe you.

580
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:56,958
You're showing stunt every day.

581
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:03,708
So, there you go. Abra ka dabra.

582
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:11,125
Just click on accept
when you get my call.

583
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,917
Just accept?

584
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:16,833
Just accept.

585
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,375
What is this?

586
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:33,125
Me. Very, very simple. Am I not?

587
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,458
Do you like me, Indian teacher?

588
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,083
Be honest.

589
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,833
Please.

590
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,708
"In my heart..."

591
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:50,292
"In my heart..."

592
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:53,167
"In my heart..."

593
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,000
"In my heart..."

594
00:44:56,417 --> 00:45:00,583
"In my heart..."

595
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:06,917
"I wonder who is that
dances in my heart."

596
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,708
"I wonder who is that
dances in my heart."

597
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:23,708
"I don't feel at peace
without seeing you, my love."

598
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:39,792
"I don't feel at peace
without seeing you, my love."

599
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:54,083
'The heart feels restless."

600
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:59,500
"Life, death and
compulsions dance along."

601
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:05,625
"Life, death and
compulsions dance along."

602
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:13,833
"Shyam, my dear Mohon."

603
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:24,833
"Shyam, my dear Mohon."

604
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:30,000
"What a delight!"

605
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,292
"What a delight!"

606
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,417
Silence!
- "What a delight!"

607
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,083
"What a delight!"

608
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:43,125
"What a delight!"

609
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:48,917
"What is that always
plays with the mridangam?"

610
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:55,000
"What is that always
plays with the mridangam?"

611
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:59,208
"What a delight!"

612
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:04,667
"What a delight!"

613
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:14,917
"Your enchanting eyes."

614
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:23,375
"O my love, my love."

615
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:31,458
"Your eyes are enchanting."

616
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:37,500
"Life, death and
compulsions dance along."

617
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:43,083
"Life, death and
compulsions dance along."

618
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:48,000
"What a delight!"

619
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:53,417
"What a delight!"

620
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,833
Iceland.

621
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:25,542
And you?

622
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,458
What me?

623
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:30,208
How do I see you?

624
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:31,625
How?

625
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,042
Web cam.

626
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:41,292
Web cam? Oh no! I feel too, too ashamed.

627
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:49,792
Compared to you I'm too ordinary.

628
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,625
Maybe, maybe not.

629
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:02,333
In my mind's eyes
you're my George Clooney.

630
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,333
Coloney?

631
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:13,000
Who is George Coloney?

632
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,667
Is he a friend?

633
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:26,458
No! You're my friend. My friend forever.

634
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:37,500
If you want to be my friend.

635
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:46,833
Can you tell your wife about me?

636
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,125
Yes.

637
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:58,292
I can.

638
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:02,625
Do you belong to me or to your wife?

639
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:09,542
I've no problem in my head.

640
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:19,583
But, if you ask me then I get confused.

641
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:54,000
Mon! Mon! Mon!

642
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:55,750
What happened?

643
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,250
Won't you go to school?

644
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:02,333
Mon, get up. Get up.

645
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:05,000
Mon, get up.

646
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:08,000
Mon, what happened?

647
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:09,958
Mon, get up.

648
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:12,167
Mon! Mon, get up.

649
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,250
Will you tell me for what
you're punishing me in this manner?

650
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:31,625
What did you promise father?

651
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:35,250
That you'll never go away from me.

652
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:39,083
You'll always be with
me through thick and thin.

653
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,375
Won't you keep your promise?

654
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,208
No, Mon!

655
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:50,458
You're the unique one.

656
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,333
You're Anjaniputra.

657
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:56,792
C'mon eat something. Eat something now.

658
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,667
C'mon, eat.

659
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,250
You've turned your face away once again.

660
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,708
What's wrong with you, Mon?

661
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:25,958
'Will you not do it for me,
George Clooney?'

662
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:31,958
Mon... it's late.

663
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:34,500
You need to take bath now.

664
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:39,958
Get up. C'mon get up.

665
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:45,958
I've cooked for you.
Get up and eat. Mon...

666
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:54,417
'Will you not do it for me?'
- Are you angry with me, Mon?

667
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:41,542
Sit down. Anjani sir is absent today.

668
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,750
I'll teach you today.

669
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:03,500
"Don't fall in love without
knowing its significance."

670
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,458
"Don't fall in love without
knowing its significance."

671
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:19,458
"Don't fall in love without
knowing its significance."

672
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:28,125
"Knowingly..."

673
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:34,667
'Will you not do it for me,
George Clooney?'

674
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,958
"You've knowingly fallen in love."

675
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:43,667
'George Clooney. George Clooney...'

676
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:48,417
'...will you not do it for me?'

677
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:56,292
'George Clooney...'

678
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,417
'...will you not do it for me?'

679
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:20,208
'George Clooney. George Clooney.'

680
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:25,667
"Don't fall in love without
knowing its significance."

681
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:30,667
"Don't fall in love without
knowing its significance."

682
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:36,458
"Fall in love after much thought."

683
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:41,917
"So that you get something in return."

684
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:10,833
What happened, Anjani sir?

685
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:12,625
Why are you here at this hour?

686
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:18,250
I want to sell my land in Moiradighi.
- All of a sudden?

687
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:33,083
Say Lord Hanuman!
- Glory to him.

688
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:37,167
Son of Pawan (wind).
- Glory to Him.

689
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:41,208
With the dust of the
lotus feet of Sri Gurudeva...

690
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,833
I clean the mirror of my mind.

691
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:47,833
I narrate the scared glory of Sri Ram...

692
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:51,583
who bestows the four fruits of life.

693
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:57,625
Considering myself as ignorant,
I meditate on you Lord Hanuman.

694
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,500
Tanushree, I'm leaving.

695
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:04,625
I had no other option.

696
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,250
I'm not renouncing domestic
life like Lord Chaitanya.

697
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:13,375
I'm an ordinary school teacher.

698
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:16,083
I'm leaving but not forever.

699
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,042
I never went beyond Bashirhat.

700
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,917
I never had to go.

701
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:33,917
Today, I, the ordinary man is setting
out to see the vast beautiful world.

702
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:40,083
I had to go or I would've to
live with an uneasy burden all my life.

703
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:45,375
A nightmare would've chased
me all my life in my sleep, Tanu.

704
00:58:45,792 --> 00:58:48,167
Believe me, I had no other option.

705
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,875
I was losing self-dignity.

706
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,708
Believe me, I'm feeling nervous.

707
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:59,208
My legs are shivering.

708
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,583
I've an uneasy feeling
inside my stomach as I'm scared.

709
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:07,167
But, I had to leave in
the search of the unknown.

710
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,046
I'll definitely tell
you the whole story one day.

711
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:12,458
I'm sure you'll understand.

712
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Deep in my heart I believe
that you'll wait for me to come back.

713
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,417
Do wait for me.

714
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:24,542
No one ever waited for me except you.

715
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:34,500
I'll end the story and come
back to my routine, regular life.

716
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:39,833
I promise you. Hanuman.

717
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:03,542
The post office seems to be open.

718
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,125
Shall I drop a letter there?
- What?

719
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:06,500
Can I drop the letter in there?

720
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:07,917
The post office is open.

721
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,792
Oh no! It's so embarrassing.

722
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:18,833
Thank god!

723
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:23,417
Are you from Dhaka?
- No. Bashirhat.

724
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:30,917
I knew it. Rustic fellow! Okay. Bye.

725
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,792
Rustic fellow!

726
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:36,583
Where are you staying?

727
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:40,750
Hold on. Let me see.
- Okay, check and tell me.

728
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,083
Rustic fellow!

729
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,750
Reykjavik 101.

730
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:59,333
I knew that you couldn't
afford a five star one.

731
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:06,417
How will you go to Reyjkavik 101?
- Ta... ta...

732
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:08,625
How much cash are you carrying?

733
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,375
Do you know how much you'll have
to pay to reach Reykjavik by ta... ta...

734
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:26,083
960 rupees in Indian currency.
- Oh god!

735
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,042
Oh god!

736
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,500
Come on. Come with me.

737
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:35,417
Lucky day.
It's your lucky day today. Come on.

738
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:40,167
Let's go. My car is coming.

739
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:43,958
Hurry up.

740
01:02:56,792 --> 01:02:58,457
What happened?
Did they disconnect the connection?

741
01:02:58,458 --> 01:02:59,749
This has become a
troublesome issue these days.

742
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,333
The new companies are just too much.

743
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:03,934
They're doing whatever they feel like.

744
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:06,375
Go home. I'll restore the connection.

745
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,458
Sir has left home.

746
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:11,875
When did he go? Where did he go?

747
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:14,833
He was a big Einstein fan.

748
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,624
He would feel sorry for his wife
and shed tears for her. - Okay.

749
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:19,625
Pine? There's no one
called Pine in our village.

750
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:21,750
Just tell me where Pine's wife lives.

751
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:22,500
I'll teach her a good lesson.

752
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,583
Share her address with me.
- In the machine.

753
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,167
I never imagined I would
get home-cooked food here.

754
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,542
I heard that Indian
Bengalis loved travelling.

755
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:34,875
Once they used to write travelogues.
Isn't it? - Yes.

756
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,542
My wife buys the annual magazine.

757
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:39,750
Actually I don't take her out for trips.

758
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:43,083
Reading the magazine
makes one feel good.

759
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:49,500
Why did you choose this place instead of
London and Paris, bro, post office bro?

760
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:55,083
Anjaniputra. - Your name?
The name given by your parents?

761
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:01,208
I can't utter that
name even in ten lives.

762
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:04,259
You've left your country a long time back.
- Don't you understand that?

763
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,792
Actually I also have an English name.
- Is it?

764
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:10,476
There was someone who gave me this name.
- Really?

765
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,780
You can all me by that name too.

766
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:13,208
What's the name? Tell me.

767
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,460
What's the name? Let me hear it.
- George Clooney.

768
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,125
Repeat it.
- George Clooney.

769
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,792
Why are you laughing?

770
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:36,458
What's so funny?

771
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:40,750
George Clooney. I love you.

772
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:45,083
You're my friend from today.
My friend George Clooney.

773
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,500
Thank you. Thank you, Hassan.

774
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:50,083
Please do me a favour.
- Yes, tell me. Tell me.

775
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,208
George Clooney, my friend.

776
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,167
Please locate this address for me.

777
01:04:57,417 --> 01:05:04,583
Maria Fischer, 21/A Lionel Messi Lane.
Reykjavik-14.

778
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,625
21/A Lionel Messi Lane.

779
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:08,333
Take a look.
- Show me.

780
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,208
Lionel Messi Lane.

781
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,333
The football player
who plays for Barcelona.

782
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:24,875
How will I know from
the address where he plays?

783
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,667
So, you've come all the
way from India to meet Maria...

784
01:05:31,292 --> 01:05:35,708
who lives in Lionel Messi lane.

785
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,417
No. Not to meet her.

786
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:46,125
My stupid friend! So she fooled you,
my dear George Clooney. - Why?

787
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,292
Hey! Hey!

788
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:04,083
Hey bro! Hey!

789
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:10,500
Hey bro! Hey!

790
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,583
C'mon, let's go. Let's go.
- No!

791
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:13,667
What's this?

792
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,375
What's this? Let's go.

793
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:17,333
What's this?

794
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:18,917
Leave me, Hassan. Leave me.

795
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You'll die here. You'll die.
- How dare she lie?

796
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:24,125
She lied to me.
- No... no... it's okay.

797
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:27,958
She lied to me.
- Forget it, bro. You'll die in this cold.

798
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:29,792
You'll die in this cold.

799
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,458
No, brother... you'll die...

800
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:35,125
No, brother... you'll die...

801
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,667
God knows what's sir's password.

802
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:17,458
Do you know his password?

803
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:22,625
What?
- Password? The key to log in.

804
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:25,083
It opens his account.
I tried many option.

805
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:29,417
Sex. Love.
Porn. But, I'm unable to log in.

806
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,250
What are you saying?
I don't know these things.

807
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:36,000
What's sir's password?

808
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,458
What's your name?

809
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:44,042
Tanushree... - Tanushr...
single 'e' or double 'e'? - Double.

810
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:48,500
Oh no! Even this didn't work.

811
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:49,976
It means he didn't even
use your name as password.

812
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,167
He's a strange man.

813
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:54,250
What can be his password? School...

814
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:59,125
Tiyasha.
- What?

815
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:06,583
T I Y A S H A.

816
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,208
That's it. I've logged in. Fantastic!

817
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,958
That's fantastic.
I've managed to log in.

818
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:15,833
Who is Tiyasha?

819
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:19,917
Who? who is she?
- Forget her.

820
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,184
No... who is she? Please tell me.
Her name helped me log in.

821
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:23,667
Who is she? Who is she?

822
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:31,917
Both of us had decided to name
our child Tiyasha if it was a girl.

823
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:39,875
And we had a daughter
but she didn't survive.

824
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:45,875
Would you like to have tea, Panchu?

825
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,000
Hey Hassan! Feet on the floor. Come on.
- Oh no!

826
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:57,375
Sit up.

827
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:59,375
Hey Hassan!
- Oh no!

828
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Coffee.

829
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:10,542
And you Noorie... Noorie...
go and get your breakfast. Come on.

830
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,542
C'mon go. It's your mom's order.

831
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,167
Hey! Come in, bro, come in.

832
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:20,625
Where am I, brother Hassan?

833
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:24,625
Where?
- Lionel Messi...

834
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:27,792
No, not in Lionel Messi lane.

835
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:32,208
You're at Pele. Pele Street.

836
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:34,212
The street next to this
one is Lionel Messi lane.

837
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:38,750
She's your sister-in-law. Khurram.

838
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:43,375
She's my daughter Nerd Noorie.

839
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:46,458
Why did you give her this name?

840
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,792
I named her after my
grandma Asman Noorie Khan.

841
01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:52,875
But it changed into Nerd Noorie.

842
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:55,333
Do you know what Nerd is?
- No.

843
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:59,292
The one who's always busy
with computers is called Nerd.

844
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,143
Don't you see her glued to the computer?

845
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:03,000
Your mom told you
to go and have breakfast.

846
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:08,333
He's our new friend George Clooney.
George Clooney.

847
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:11,750
Does he want coffee?

848
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:20,208
Come, brother George. Come close. Come.

849
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,458
Come.

850
01:10:26,792 --> 01:10:29,667
You've caught bad cold.
- It's very cold here.

851
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:32,125
After all you're in Iceland.

852
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:37,208
You spent so much money and
took so much trouble to come here.

853
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:41,708
Stay here for some days.
Eat and enjoy. Got it?

854
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:44,292
Then go back home.

855
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:49,542
I'm indebted to you.
I don't know how I'll repay you.

856
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,473
Why do you worry?
Everything will be fine.

857
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:53,042
After all you're a good boy.

858
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:09,750
Is she Pine's wife?
- Not Pine, it's Einstein.

859
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,042
That's the same. Is she his wife?
- Maybe.

860
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:19,792
Can I say something? Please don't mind.

861
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:30,083
Pine's wife isn't
as affectionate as you.

862
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,125
I swear.

863
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:41,750
Good evening, Hassan.

864
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,833
It's so cold.

865
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:48,750
Iceland is a cold country.

866
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:50,125
How can you expect it to be hot?

867
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,375
Want to have some coffee?

868
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:53,333
I think people don't
drink tea in this country.

869
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:55,583
You're my friend.

870
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,125
I can get even tiger's urine
for you to drink. Just ask for it.

871
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:01,208
You say whatever you feel like.

872
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:07,042
The girls here are born mature.
They're born mature.

873
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,208
Vida! Vida!

874
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:12,833
Get a cup of Indian tea
for my friend George Clooney.

875
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,833
There you go, George.
- Thank you.

876
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:25,875
I told you to burkha so many times.

877
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,792
Even customers get frightened seeing you.
- Fuck off.

878
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:31,000
George.

879
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,333
George...

880
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,250
What's wrong with you?

881
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,333
What's wrong with you?

882
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:48,042
I'm feeling very scared.
- Scared?

883
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,768
What are you scared of?
We're with you.

884
01:12:50,792 --> 01:12:52,559
Please share everything with me.
What are you scared of?

885
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:53,583
Do you want to hear?

886
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:56,250
Of course, I'll hear you. Tell me.

887
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,583
Actually...

888
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:03,667
What's the exact meaning
of 'heart is beating fast'?

889
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:10,292
It's written here that...
legs are shivering.

890
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:13,333
The heart is beating fast.
The legs are shivering.

891
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:16,143
The heart beating fast and the legs
shivering at this age aren't good signs.

892
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:17,583
No. No.

893
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:20,292
Sister-in-law, I'll tell you something.

894
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:24,958
It's not healthy to
have spicy and oily food.

895
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,667
It's also written that... stomach.

896
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:31,417
The stomach is feeling uneasy.

897
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,750
Sir...
- Keep it.

898
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,625
You've to keep an eye on his health.

899
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:47,917
Oh no! Try to find out where sir is.

900
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,250
Why are you discussing
diseases here? Strange!

901
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,208
Why are you getting angry?

902
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:57,750
Where can he go?
- Hey!

903
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,625
What a weird man!

904
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,792
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

905
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:03,625
Where are you going?
Sister-in-law!

906
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,083
What happened?

907
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:09,875
What happened? What's wrong?

908
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:13,000
I won't try to find him anymore.

909
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:14,875
I've made a mistake.

910
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,958
I won't try to find him.

911
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:20,167
I've made a mistake.
I won't try to find him.

912
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,750
He's going away from me.

913
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:25,125
I don't want to find
out about his whereabouts.

914
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:26,792
I will wait for him.

915
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:29,000
I'll wait.
- Where are you going, sister-in-law?

916
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:45,500
I've lost, Tanu.

917
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:52,167
The person for whom I spent
so much money and came here.

918
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:56,042
Why? The butterfly didn't
get caught in your net?

919
01:15:57,917 --> 01:15:59,458
What butterfly?

920
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:05,667
Whatever information
she shared was fake.

921
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:12,750
She doesn't live in Iceland.
- Iceland?

922
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:17,250
Why will Maria be in Iceland?

923
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:20,417
You know about her?

924
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:28,542
She lived in Germany near Munich.
- You? You?

925
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:36,625
Why won't I know? She sent you a
photo in pink dress with her hair open.

926
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:43,000
The wall clock behind
her ran in opposite direction.

927
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:46,042
It shows 1 instead of 11.

928
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:50,792
Before Tisu was born father
went to Munich, Germany...

929
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:53,458
to work in a factory for two years.

930
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:58,042
Father brought that opposite
clock for us and said that...

931
01:16:58,792 --> 01:17:04,125
the unique clock was found
nowhere except in Munich, Germany...

932
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:05,875
and in our house in Mechda.

933
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:11,292
I thought that you
went to Munich to meet her.

934
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,875
Meet her?

935
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:22,167
She was murdered, Tanu...
right before my eyes.

936
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:39,792
Hey George!

937
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:47,042
Can I tell you something?
- Yes, tell me.

938
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:53,042
I would like you to
know that I'm your friend.

939
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:56,375
Your story has touched me.

940
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:59,833
If I can help you I'll really be happy.

941
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:09,208
I also want to be our friend.
Will you be my friend?

942
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,667
Every weekend I've problem with you.
- No!

943
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:17,375
Every weekend I've problem.
- No! You're my problem.

944
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:19,708
You're a bloody bitch.
- Nothing else. You are. - No!

945
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,042
Shut up!
- You shut up!

946
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,184
What happened?
- This is bullshit.

947
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:24,542
I don't know brother from
where this woman came in my life.

948
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:29,250
What happened?
- Worthless woman!

949
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:33,250
George, this constipated
man abuses me every weekend.

950
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,791
I mean a girl has a life after all.

951
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:36,250
I've given her a good one.

952
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:38,454
I' an actress,
I don't want be a waitress all my life.

953
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:42,292
What? You're an actress.
You want to be an actress? - Yes.

954
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:44,917
I'm doing a small production
of Shakespeare's Macbeth.

955
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:46,875
Everything alright? Don't mind us.

956
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:48,208
You know Macbeth?

957
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:52,125
I just look like an idiot, Frieda.
- Come on.

958
01:18:52,208 --> 01:18:53,958
Didn't mean that, George.

959
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:56,667
Just can't convince this
man here that I can't sell...

960
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:58,292
chicken tikkas and naan all my life.

961
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,250
Shut up, worthless woman!

962
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,708
Calm down.

963
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:04,458
It's a fact. She's trying to instigate you.
- Calm down.

964
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:06,708
It's a full house tomorrow on Saturday.
- Okay.

965
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:07,976
She's a good girl. Let her go.

966
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,833
Good girl! I need help.
- I'll help you.

967
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:12,875
Can you do it?
- I'll try.

968
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:14,208
Will you charge for it?

969
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,018
You've given me place
to stay and food to eat.

970
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,583
Why will I ask you to give me money?

971
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:21,458
For him I'm letting you go,
bloody bitch. For him.

972
01:19:21,542 --> 01:19:23,582
Don't lose your temper.
- Next weekend I'll see you. - Okay.

973
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:25,083
Calm down.

974
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:27,667
I managed. You can go and do your play.

975
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,750
I'll manage here.
- Really?

976
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:33,667
So, you want to see me act?
- Of course.

977
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:35,292
Thank you.

978
01:19:36,167 --> 01:19:37,167
Thank you.

979
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,625
Nerd Noorie.

980
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:52,375
Nerd Noorie.

981
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:55,917
Nerd Noorie.

982
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,167
Can you play hopscotch?
- What?

983
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,000
George, your turn.

984
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:36,208
C'mon play. Take it.

985
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,000
I'm feeling cold.

986
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:42,667
What happened?

987
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,458
What happened, George?

988
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:51,083
I've lost, Noorie.
- Why, George?

989
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:54,667
I've lost, Noorie.
- You lost?

990
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:58,292
But you were winning.

991
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,875
I've lost.
- What happened?

992
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,958
George!

993
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:09,042
The game is not yet over, George.

994
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:11,583
The game is still on.

995
01:21:17,042 --> 01:21:21,625
C'mon, we'll play again
and you'll win the game.

996
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:24,083
Come on. Let's play again.

997
01:21:24,417 --> 01:21:29,500
'Fair is foul and foul is fair.'

998
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:33,542
'Hover through the fog and filthy air'

999
01:21:33,792 --> 01:21:37,833
'When shall we three meet again.'

1000
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:42,833
'In thunder, lightning or in rain.'

1001
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:46,458
'When the hurly burly's done.'

1002
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:50,583
'When the battle's lost and won.'

1003
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:56,000
'That will be ere the set of sun.'

1004
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:27,542
So, tell me George,
which one of us did you like the most?

1005
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:32,042
Of course you.

1006
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:33,708
Be honest.

1007
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:38,542
You're a wonderful actress, Frieda.

1008
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:42,042
Of course the rest
of them were also good.

1009
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,917
They're also very good actors.

1010
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:01,958
Here's your beer.

1011
01:23:05,292 --> 01:23:07,083
This for you.

1012
01:23:07,167 --> 01:23:08,333
This one.

1013
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:09,917
Hey George!

1014
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:11,125
Excuse me.

1015
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:14,083
George, beer. Number five. Over there.

1016
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,458
Thank you.

1017
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,792
What's wrong with you?

1018
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,375
What's wrong with you?

1019
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:49,000
Get some water. Quick.

1020
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:53,500
Calm down.

1021
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,958
Now you're after the mayor.

1022
01:24:26,292 --> 01:24:28,958
I never forget what I see once, Hassan.

1023
01:24:30,042 --> 01:24:31,375
Forget it.

1024
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,292
You'll land in trouble
and drag us into it too.

1025
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:35,375
You're dangerous.

1026
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:38,250
When are leaving?

1027
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:40,708
Patient of epilepsy!

1028
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:44,500
Your health is deteriorating
in this cold country, George.

1029
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,875
Listen, pack your bags.

1030
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:51,500
Must go and check out Reykjavik 101.

1031
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:53,708
Enough of free lunches.

1032
01:24:53,792 --> 01:24:56,167
Go and pack your bags. Go. Go.

1033
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:58,208
Scoundrel!

1034
01:24:58,292 --> 01:25:00,207
I picked him up from
the streets and helped him...

1035
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,792
how he wants to land me in trouble.

1036
01:25:01,875 --> 01:25:04,708
I've to handle all
these epilepsy patients.

1037
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:06,000
I'll go away.

1038
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:31,083
I'm leaving, Nerd Noorie.

1039
01:25:35,542 --> 01:25:41,583
George, I would like you
to know that I believe in you.

1040
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,417
Thanks.

1041
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,792
Sit here.

1042
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:05,375
I've a plan but I'm
not clear about it yet.

1043
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:09,000
What's the plan?

1044
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:13,000
You leave now.
I'll share it with you later.

1045
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:19,708
I can't continue like this anymore.

1046
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:22,042
But, I know you'll be able to do it.

1047
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:30,542
You think I can do it?
- Yes, you can.

1048
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:01,625
Don't go. Please don't mind him.

1049
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:11,208
Thank you.

1050
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:16,208
"Spree ha tem on."

1051
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:21,625
"The shattered path ahead."

1052
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:27,250
"Your humble abode."

1053
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:32,875
"Beyond the last uninhabited land."

1054
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:43,958
"As evening descends, let's go back."

1055
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:53,000
"Let's go."

1056
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,250
"Let's go."

1057
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:03,375
"Let's go."

1058
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:06,083
Madam, won't you eat?

1059
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:14,125
"If you don't come close
how can we part ways?"

1060
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:22,792
"If we don't part ways
how can't we come close again."

1061
01:28:25,417 --> 01:28:27,375
"C'mon, tell me."

1062
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:35,042
"Tell me."

1063
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:40,375
"Tell me."

1064
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:45,625
"Let's go."

1065
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:51,125
"Tell me, let's go."

1066
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:56,125
"Let's go. Tell me."

1067
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:06,333
"The happy faces..."

1068
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:11,917
"showing their fake happy teeth."

1069
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:21,167
"Forget all your whims
and fancies and tell me."

1070
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:29,000
"Let the evening descend..."

1071
01:29:30,042 --> 01:29:34,333
"Continue walking alone."

1072
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:37,750
"Let's go."

1073
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:43,375
"Let's go."

1074
01:29:44,917 --> 01:29:48,500
"Let's go."

1075
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:21,958
Sister-in-law...
why are you scared? It's me.

1076
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:25,583
I came to enquire about you.

1077
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:29,458
I don't know where Anjani
sir suddenly vanished.

1078
01:30:30,667 --> 01:30:34,417
Somebody was stalking about another
woman in his life, Mr. Pine's wife.

1079
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,292
You're feeling scared again.

1080
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,292
Don't be scared.

1081
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:41,417
I dropped in to ask
if you need any help.

1082
01:30:42,458 --> 01:30:45,042
We're with you. Bye.

1083
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,125
Don't hesitate to ask for anything.

1084
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:12,750
George!

1085
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:17,833
George! George!

1086
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:19,958
George! George!

1087
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:23,167
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

1088
01:31:24,708 --> 01:31:28,958
I was waiting for the bus here.
- Bus?

1089
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:31,083
Are you going away?

1090
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,083
I should nail that bastard.
What do you say?

1091
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:37,167
Don't use abusive word.
You're a god girl, my dear.

1092
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,125
But I want to nab the killer.

1093
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:41,583
I've a plan.

1094
01:31:54,292 --> 01:31:58,875
But Nerd Noorie,
a person doesn't live inside a computer.

1095
01:32:00,792 --> 01:32:03,375
Oh silly boy! Who told you?

1096
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:06,208
The computer is like a house.

1097
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:09,250
You need keys to enter
a house and here you've password.

1098
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:12,333
You can open and close
all doors and windows.

1099
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:17,750
There are Windows,
friends and even love.

1100
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:19,833
Then why is it not a house?

1101
01:32:20,417 --> 01:32:22,292
I love staying there throughout the day.

1102
01:32:23,833 --> 01:32:25,792
Nerd Noorie, what's our plan?

1103
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:29,250
If we consider the computer our house...
- Yes...

1104
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:33,833
there are doors and keys there.
- Yes.

1105
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:37,833
We can break the doors.

1106
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:42,167
You want to break the doors?
Whose doors?

1107
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:46,583
The murderer's.
- What?

1108
01:32:46,917 --> 01:32:52,792
If we can break through
the mayor's doors...

1109
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:56,125
we'll get hold of all his secrets.
Isn't it?

1110
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,375
You want to break in the computer?

1111
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:01,000
Why? Can't I do it?

1112
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:04,042
No, dear.
I don't want to break anything.

1113
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:05,917
I'm a foreigner here.

1114
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:07,792
I can't break anything.

1115
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,708
Who told you to do it? I'll do it.

1116
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:16,833
Just wait and watch. I'm the nerd.
- No, dear. You're a good girl.

1117
01:33:16,875 --> 01:33:19,792
Let's go back.
- You want to go back empty-handed?

1118
01:33:21,542 --> 01:33:23,167
Will you feel good about it?

1119
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:26,750
Knowing that the murderer
was right before your eyes...

1120
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:29,250
but you couldn't
be brave enough to nab him.

1121
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:32,750
Would you feel good about it, George?

1122
01:33:35,542 --> 01:33:36,958
What do you say?

1123
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:39,667
Should I break in the
computers doors or not?

1124
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:42,667
Yes or no?

1125
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:48,583
Yes.

1126
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,625
"Eenie meenie mini mo."

1127
01:34:06,667 --> 01:34:08,750
"There goes Majumdar."

1128
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:10,625
"Chased by Damodar."

1129
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:12,750
"Damodar's utensils."

1130
01:34:12,792 --> 01:34:14,750
"They sit and clean grains."

1131
01:34:14,792 --> 01:34:16,708
"They got late cleaning the grains."

1132
01:34:16,792 --> 01:34:18,708
"He has rice for lunch."

1133
01:34:18,792 --> 01:34:20,542
"There's a fly in the rice."

1134
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:22,625
"He uses a spade to get rid of it."

1135
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:26,667
"Get rid of it."

1136
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,667
"You the sons of Ghosh, Bose, Roys."

1137
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,750
"Let's play a new game chuck your toys."

1138
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:32,750
"Life is in your control.
Let' s deal with it."

1139
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:33,625
"Life is a game."

1140
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:34,792
"This is your chance."

1141
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:36,458
"Dance your dance."

1142
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,167
"Dance your dance."

1143
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:40,250
"Dance your dance."

1144
01:34:40,583 --> 01:34:42,167
"Dance your dance."

1145
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:44,417
"Dance your dance."

1146
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,958
"Dance your dance."

1147
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:47,750
"Dance your dance."

1148
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,125
"Dance your dance."

1149
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:52,042
"Dance your dance."

1150
01:34:52,833 --> 01:34:54,083
"Dance your dance."

1151
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:56,667
Hili gili hocus focus.

1152
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,292
Hili gili hocus focus.

1153
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:00,792
Yeah!

1154
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:03,667
Look at this. We're can easily
access the mayor's computer now.

1155
01:35:04,292 --> 01:35:05,667
Right!

1156
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:06,708
He's hacked.

1157
01:35:10,917 --> 01:35:14,917
Now his computer,
I mean his house is in our hands.

1158
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:17,833
Your father is absolutely right.

1159
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:21,000
You know everything about computers.

1160
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,708
Father says it's in my butt.

1161
01:35:22,792 --> 01:35:25,542
Don't use bad words, my dear.
You're a girl. Don't use abusive words.

1162
01:35:27,542 --> 01:35:28,643
"The old fellows oiling themselves."

1163
01:35:28,667 --> 01:35:29,250
"The big fat lies."

1164
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:31,250
"What will you do with it?
Take it easy."

1165
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:33,292
"The shackles want to hold you back."

1166
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:34,375
"They want to harm."

1167
01:35:34,542 --> 01:35:36,250
"Shout at them and tell them to stop."

1168
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:39,542
"Stop! Stop!"

1169
01:35:39,625 --> 01:35:41,333
"Come my odd life come."

1170
01:35:41,417 --> 01:35:43,208
"Come my odd life come."

1171
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:45,500
"Life is a game.
This is your chance."

1172
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:46,625
"Dance your dance."

1173
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:48,542
"Dance your dance."

1174
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,458
"Dance your dance."

1175
01:35:51,417 --> 01:35:52,500
"Dance your dance."

1176
01:35:55,542 --> 01:35:56,583
"Dance your dance."

1177
01:35:57,417 --> 01:35:58,500
"Dance your dance."

1178
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,375
"Dance your dance."

1179
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:04,417
"Dance your dance."

1180
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:06,583
"Dance your dance."

1181
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:08,792
"Dance your dance."

1182
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,000
"Dance your dance."

1183
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:15,208
"Dance your dance."

1184
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,958
"Dance your dance."

1185
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:23,542
George, are you loony?
- What? - Are you a loony?

1186
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:27,333
No, I'm not loony.
I'm a Bengali from West Bengal.

1187
01:36:28,708 --> 01:36:32,708
Oh boy, cocoon I believed in him.
Oh shit!

1188
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,083
Did you call me a cuckoo?
Thank you, Noorie.

1189
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,583
Boy, he's a loony.
- No. No. I'm not loony, I'm a Bengali.

1190
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:42,500
You can ask your father.

1191
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:45,917
He always says that George is a loony.
- What?

1192
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,417
I told your dad several
times that I'm from Bashirhat.

1193
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,333
How could he say that
I'm from loony land?

1194
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:57,375
What happened, my dear? What happened?

1195
01:36:59,333 --> 01:37:03,708
I hacked the mayor's ID
as I believed in you. Isn't it?

1196
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:07,542
I searched everywhere
in the e-mails and folders.

1197
01:37:07,792 --> 01:37:10,292
There's nothing about Maria Fischer.

1198
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:12,375
There's no girl related thing there.

1199
01:37:12,458 --> 01:37:14,792
Just believe it. It's a cool IQ.

1200
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:19,458
For three days now my
brain was marred. Marred.

1201
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:22,167
George, it's all your fault.

1202
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:41,208
Noorie, do you know Swapan Kumar?
- What?

1203
01:37:41,917 --> 01:37:43,208
Swapan Kumar.

1204
01:37:43,417 --> 01:37:47,000
He suggests that we should
check in the dustbins of the criminals.

1205
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:50,042
Yeah. He must be a loony cap like you.

1206
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:52,083
No. He's also a Bong.

1207
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:54,208
He's my favourite detective.

1208
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:56,500
Tell me about him.

1209
01:37:56,708 --> 01:38:00,583
Okay. Swapan Kumar always
says that murderers will...

1210
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,333
try to erase all evidence.

1211
01:38:02,417 --> 01:38:06,667
But, if you want to find any
evidence you must look in his dustbin...

1212
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,542
that's because people
forget to clean their dustbins.

1213
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:11,750
Tanu forgets doing that very often.

1214
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:16,417
Who's Tanu?
- My wife.

1215
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:24,875
Noorie, does the mayor's
computer house have a dustbin?

1216
01:38:25,667 --> 01:38:29,958
What?
- Dustbin? Garbage bin.

1217
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:34,500
Dustbin?

1218
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,833
Yes, there is. Let me check.

1219
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:01,167
The mail is here.

1220
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:04,792
The mail is here.

1221
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:06,667
The mail is here, George.

1222
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:09,375
The mayor has actually killed the girl.

1223
01:39:09,625 --> 01:39:11,792
You were speaking the truth.
You're not a loony.

1224
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,499
I've been repeatedly telling
you that I'm a Bongali...

1225
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,125
but, you were
not ready to believe me.

1226
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:20,708
You're a genius, George.
- It's not me.

1227
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,000
It's Swapan Kumar.

1228
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:24,375
Let me see what's written in the mail.

1229
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:29,250
Dear volcanic hot boy,
now I know why you're so volcanic...

1230
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:32,333
because you come
from a land of volcanoes.

1231
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:34,625
'I would like to apologize...'
- Iceland.

1232
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,542
I found out who you really
are on TV in an interview.

1233
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:42,875
At night when you're hunting for women.

1234
01:39:42,958 --> 01:39:44,833
You cover your face with a mask.

1235
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:49,000
But the mask does not cover your mole.

1236
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:51,750
I want to see it. Please leave me.

1237
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:54,583
No. No, dear Noorie. I'm like your dad.

1238
01:39:54,667 --> 01:39:57,792
I request you not to watch this.

1239
01:39:58,458 --> 01:40:03,792
Dull material?
- Bad material.

1240
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,500
Yes! Look at this George.

1241
01:40:38,542 --> 01:40:40,833
Noorie, you're a genius.

1242
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:43,667
George, I'm just a plain nerd.

1243
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:48,958
We can access Maria's computer now.
- Right.

1244
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:54,083
We'll bring Maria back to life again.

1245
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:58,958
But, Maria is dead.

1246
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:02,792
George, you're very stupid.

1247
01:41:07,583 --> 01:41:09,625
I also want your opinion to consider.

1248
01:41:10,042 --> 01:41:12,000
Well, I completely
agree with you on that.

1249
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:17,417
Well if you take a look at
the action plan from last November...

1250
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:21,667
you can see that there are still
some factors that have to be revised...

1251
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:23,208
before continuing.

1252
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:28,708
Yeah, I've somebody on the
job and it might be ready by next week.

1253
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,250
Would we get it by Wednesday?

1254
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:33,583
What?
- Would we get it by Wednesday?

1255
01:41:33,792 --> 01:41:36,000
My department is really pressing...

1256
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:38,833
I'm not aware of my schedule right now.

1257
01:41:38,917 --> 01:41:41,125
This is really important.

1258
01:41:42,417 --> 01:41:45,000
Would you like to have some coffee?
- Yes.

1259
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:49,625
When will you get back to it?
- I'll tell you.

1260
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:52,000
I don't know, I've no idea.

1261
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:58,417
George... I'm worried, you know.

1262
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:01,833
Why?

1263
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:06,125
We're going on the right path, Nerd Noorie.
- No.

1264
01:42:06,542 --> 01:42:09,042
You need to put a real
detective to handle this.

1265
01:42:09,292 --> 01:42:11,500
You mean Swapan Kumar.

1266
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:15,125
Yes. the person you always talk about.

1267
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:16,332
The only man in India who
wears an overcoat in India...

1268
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:18,458
despite the hot
and humid weather there.

1269
01:42:19,292 --> 01:42:21,042
Ask him for a way forward.

1270
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Hello.

1271
01:42:57,208 --> 01:43:00,500
So, are you happy to hear from me?

1272
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:03,583
You'll hear more from me.

1273
01:43:04,292 --> 01:43:06,083
Good night.

1274
01:43:33,333 --> 01:43:34,542
Come. Come.

1275
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:36,385
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

1276
01:43:36,417 --> 01:43:37,833
I've stolen, George.

1277
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:40,750
What have you stolen?
- Don't ask. Just come.

1278
01:43:40,833 --> 01:43:42,458
Wait, let me take my shawl.

1279
01:43:44,583 --> 01:43:47,500
Come.

1280
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:54,042
Look.
- Hey! Is this a real gun? - Yes.

1281
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:56,208
From where did you get this?

1282
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,458
I stole it from dad's closet.

1283
01:43:58,542 --> 01:44:01,083
Does your dad keep a gun with him?

1284
01:44:01,458 --> 01:44:06,542
Is that a smart question to ask?
- No. No...

1285
01:44:08,125 --> 01:44:12,833
Well, then... Bengali detective,
would you like to try?

1286
01:44:12,917 --> 01:44:15,208
No, I can't use this.

1287
01:44:15,417 --> 01:44:17,167
Where have you landed me, Lord Hanuman.

1288
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,833
Please help me get out of this trouble.

1289
01:44:19,792 --> 01:44:23,542
Are you scared?
- Of course, dear. I'm a little scared.

1290
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,625
What are doing?

1291
01:44:28,917 --> 01:44:32,083
Enjoy the fear.
- How can I enjoy fear?

1292
01:44:32,375 --> 01:44:33,042
It's fun.

1293
01:44:33,125 --> 01:44:34,917
It may be fun for you but not me.

1294
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,375
Go and keep it back in your
dad's closet. Go and keep it.

1295
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:39,833
You've to learn.

1296
01:45:26,417 --> 01:45:29,375
I'm assuring you,
I know about your concert.

1297
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:33,625
But, I told you before it's
not the way it works in London.

1298
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:36,292
It's not going to work over here. Okay.

1299
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:40,625
No. No. Thank you.

1300
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:42,125
No. No. Thank you.

1301
01:46:27,458 --> 01:46:28,667
Let me help you.

1302
01:46:31,125 --> 01:46:32,125
Thank you.

1303
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:35,500
You're welcome.

1304
01:46:43,208 --> 01:46:46,292
"He's the messenger of Rama,
the powerful one."

1305
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,917
"The son of Anjani and Pawan."

1306
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,042
Say.

1307
01:47:29,458 --> 01:47:33,667
"It sails by without any reason."

1308
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:35,792
"It sails by..."

1309
01:47:36,042 --> 01:47:38,708
You've to do it once again.
Wait. get ready.

1310
01:47:38,792 --> 01:47:40,958
One. Two. Three. Four.
- Don't make me laugh.

1311
01:47:41,208 --> 01:47:43,458
One. Two. Three. Four.

1312
01:47:43,542 --> 01:47:47,292
"O he sails by without any reason..."

1313
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:50,042
"It sails by..."

1314
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:58,167
The sight of it scares me.

1315
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:59,625
Enough of your fear.

1316
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:00,917
Hold it.
- No.

1317
01:48:00,958 --> 01:48:04,250
Hold it, George.
- I can't use it. Believe me. - What?

1318
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:07,208
I was not like this.
- Not like what?

1319
01:48:07,292 --> 01:48:09,708
The one who plays with guns.
- Don't play.

1320
01:48:09,958 --> 01:48:11,625
Don't play anymore.

1321
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:13,833
You must put a prey before the lion.
- What?

1322
01:48:13,917 --> 01:48:17,000
The game has to end somewhere.
- The game?

1323
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:18,958
Yes.

1324
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:46,833
No! No!

1325
01:50:46,917 --> 01:50:48,958
I'll get the shit out of you, bitch.

1326
01:51:17,083 --> 01:51:18,708
I'm sorry.

1327
01:51:18,958 --> 01:51:20,167
I'm sorry.

1328
01:51:21,625 --> 01:51:25,708
I'm sorry, Frieda. I'm sorry.

1329
01:51:27,792 --> 01:51:29,167
I'm sorry.

1330
01:51:42,958 --> 01:51:44,375
I'm so sorry.

1331
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:46,542
I'm so sorry.

1332
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:57,042
I'm so sorry.

1333
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:59,292
I'm so sorry.

1334
01:52:04,292 --> 01:52:06,125
I'm so sorry.

1335
01:54:16,625 --> 01:54:17,833
Hello George.

1336
01:54:26,167 --> 01:54:33,042
"When he and I can be as one."

1337
01:54:35,667 --> 01:54:42,708
"Black is the colour
of my true love's hair."

1338
01:54:45,292 --> 01:54:53,292
"How I wish that day will soon come!"

1339
01:54:54,250 --> 01:55:01,208
"When he and I can be as one."

1340
01:55:03,792 --> 01:55:11,292
"Black is the colour
of my true love's hair."

1341
01:55:17,917 --> 01:55:19,708
Thank you, George.

1342
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,125
Hey! Sit properly.

1343
01:56:33,208 --> 01:56:34,968
Can't you see that
there's a lady next to me?

1344
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:45,500
"Say Lord Hanuman!
- Glory to Him."

1345
01:56:45,542 --> 01:56:53,542
"Lord hanuman!
- Glory to Him."

1346
01:56:56,167 --> 01:56:59,875
"O boatman..."

1347
01:57:00,958 --> 01:57:07,625
"Help me anchor my boat."

1348
01:57:10,375 --> 01:57:14,417
"The son of Pawan (wind-god),
the saviour."

1349
01:57:14,875 --> 01:57:18,875
"The auspicious one.'

1350
01:57:19,667 --> 01:57:27,667
"The one in whose heart resides Ram,
Lakshman and Sita."

1351
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:34,125
"Say Lord Hanuman!
- Glory to Him."

1352
01:57:34,208 --> 01:57:38,167
"The son of Pawan.
- Glory to Him."

1353
01:57:38,708 --> 01:57:42,625
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

1354
01:59:14,667 --> 01:59:15,875
Tea for you.

1355
01:59:19,042 --> 01:59:20,958
Tea.

1356
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:34,375
You didn't call me an evil man today.

1357
01:59:36,458 --> 01:59:38,792
I didn't add sugar to your tea.

1358
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,250
I'm used to it.

1359
01:59:47,458 --> 01:59:52,042
They've mentioned in the newspaper
that monsoon is coming. Look.

1360
02:00:12,708 --> 02:00:14,000
Do you love me?

1361
02:00:19,083 --> 02:00:20,708
Yes, I love you.

1362
02:00:27,417 --> 02:00:34,083
Remember that no one
waited for you except me.

1363
02:00:38,542 --> 02:00:45,125
"The one who was the
beloved of my dreams."

1364
02:00:46,292 --> 02:00:52,417
"I couldn't figure her out."

1365
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:58,542
"I couldn't figure her out."

1366
02:00:59,833 --> 02:01:07,833
"I spent my days looking for her."

1367
02:01:09,417 --> 02:01:16,375
"The one who was the
beloved of my dreams."

1368
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:22,708
"I couldn't figure her out."

1369
02:01:22,792 --> 02:01:29,250
"I couldn't figure her out."

1370
02:01:30,333 --> 02:01:36,125
"You came close to me
at an auspicious moment."

1371
02:01:36,458 --> 02:01:44,458
"You covered up my shyness."

1372
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:53,042
"Black is the colour
of my true love's hair."

1373
02:01:55,458 --> 02:02:03,458
"His lips are like some roses fair."

1374
02:02:04,625 --> 02:02:12,583
"He has the sweetest smile
and the strongest hands."

1375
02:02:14,125 --> 02:02:22,125
"And I love the ground
where on he stands."

1376
02:02:23,875 --> 02:02:31,208
"I love my love and well he knows."

1377
02:02:32,458 --> 02:02:38,083
"You came close to me
at an auspicious moment."

1378
02:02:38,375 --> 02:02:45,083
"You covered up my shyness."

1379
02:02:47,375 --> 02:02:55,375
"Now I've understood who you are."

1380
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:03,833
"The one who was the
beloved of my dreams."

1381
02:03:03,917 --> 02:03:09,958
"I couldn't figure her out."

1382
02:03:10,042 --> 02:03:15,833
"I couldn't figure her out."

1383
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:23,958
"The one who may send
me back with neglect."

1384

"Whose soul may ache for me,
the one who'll value my love."

1386

"I could only understand you."

1391
02:04:18,083 --> 02:04:26,083
"You came close to me
at an auspicious moment."

1392
02:04:27,208 --> 02:04:29,792
"You covered up my shyness."
