1
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,249
That's great, my dear Anu!

2
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,291
Smart girl!

3
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,439
Is this the one?

4
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,278
Isn't it this one?

5
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:48,874
Wow!

6
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,624
Place it here.

7
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,041
Look!

8
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:22,499
See!

9
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,166
Like this!

10
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,958
Now do it on your own, Anu dear.

11
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:29,749
Yeah! Like that!

12
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:37,532
Anu...

13
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:40,188
Are you upset because you
got low marks in Hindi?

14
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,659
Be positive!

15
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,699
What is this?

16
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,157
Before going on action,
us soldiers say this...

17
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:48,012
'There is always a Plan B'.

18
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,016
Dear...

19
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,944
Our life is like a jigsaw puzzle.

20
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:04,574
Joining the necessary
pieces at the right time...

21
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,234
... is called logic.

22
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:20,055
Whatever may be the price I have
to pay, I must secure your future.

23
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,282
If something happens to me,
you won't have anyone.

24
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:28,449
Don't worry, Dad.

25
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:30,282
I have an interview next month.

26
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:31,741
I'll definitely get that job.

27
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:33,741
There is always a Plan B.
(in Hindi)

28
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,358
It was brought to me by Lord Anjaneya,
whom I believe in.

29
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,157
Tomorrow I will go to Koonamkunnu.

30
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:47,741
To pray to the Goddess.

31
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,241
And day after, to Thiruvananthapuram.

32
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,032
To meet someone.

33
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,282
When I come back from there,

34
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,657
your life will be secure.

35
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,857
December 5/2016
Kochi City

36
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:25,632
Stop! Stop!

37
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,507
Pull over!
Come on!

38
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,299
Get out.

39
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:39,299
Come on, walk!
- What is it?

40
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,799
Don't touch me!
Do not touch me!

41
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:44,299
Don't get angry.
We need to search your vehicle.

42
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:46,757
What's the problem?
- Hey! Open the boot.

43
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,132
Why do you want
to search my car?

44
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:50,132
We've got information.
- You do not know whom you're playing with.

45
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:52,216
You will have to face the consequences.

46
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:07,882
CC 756/2016

47
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:09,632

CC 88/2017

49
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,257
Counsel for the accused,
Mr. Balakrishnan?

50
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:53,382
Ye... Ye... Ye....

51
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:55,007
Yes, Your Honour.

52
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:00,021
M... M.... My c... c... c.....

53
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:01,382
Client!

54
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:02,872
C... c... client!

55
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,341
Go...  go.... go....

56
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,341
Should I go?

57
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:09,132
Should I sit?

58
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,341
Then?

59
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,132
Got into Police Cu....

60
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,257
Understood.

61
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,841
Your client is in police custody.

62
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:17,466
You need bail.
That's all, right?

63
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,632
You're a stammerer?

64
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:28,507
You scoundrel! You gave me this
stammerer to fight my case?

65
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:29,913
I'll sort you out later.

66
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,699
Anzar Ali Khan, right?

67
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:34,866
Don't you have a tongue?

68
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,616
Say your name aloud!

69
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:41,741
Na... Na... Na....

70
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:44,157
Na.. Na...
- Nasty?

71
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:45,832
You or him?

72
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:48,336
Name... - Insolence!
- Insurance?

73
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,986
What is this, Mr. Balakrishnan?

74
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:52,727
If you're going to plead like this,
I can't hear the next case today.

75
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,201
Madam Prosecutor...

76
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,461
Your Honour, enquiry against the
accused is still in progress.

77
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:01,691
What enquiry, Madam?

78
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:06,249
He took away 10 bunches of bananas left to
ripen in a vegetable shop's store room.

79
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:10,300
He threw faeces tied up in a cloth,
on to the shopkeeper who tried to stop him.

80
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:11,084
It was my own!

81
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,553
To stop him from chasing him, he squeezed
out the air from his scooter's wheel.

82
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,500
When will the extensive investigation
about this get done, Madam?

83
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,333
Well...
Certain loose ends!

84
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:23,274
So you admit there are loose ends!

85
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:26,790
Don't bite your nails.
I don't like it.

86
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,241
Advocate!

87
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:32,644
You've started pleading cases
on your own now, huh?

88
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:38,178
T... This is not such a b....
big case, right?

89
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,203
That's true.

90
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:42,358
Anyway, people like him won't
get any good advocates.

91
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:43,967
Let this be a good start.

92
00:08:44,477 --> 00:08:48,061
C... C... Corpse.
- Corpse? Who? Me?

93
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,407
You should fight many
cases hereafter.

94
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,432
You should grow, and become big!

95
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,616
There's a lot of time left.

96
00:08:58,899 --> 00:08:59,899
All the best.

97
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,305
Than....

98
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,759
You may move back.

99
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,034
Bail granted.

100
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:24,920
Advocate!

101
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:26,318
Am I going back in, or outside?

102
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:28,405
O... Outside!

103
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,055
Silence!

104
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,237
Do you want anything?
- Yes, I also want.

105
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,446
Nothing for me?

106
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:40,888
Give him some of your hair.

107
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,436
Celebrate! Celebrate!

108
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:45,086
Ikka, only tea and snacks?
Nothing strong?

109
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:47,149
Was that strong enough?

110
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:48,816
Or tell me.
I'll make it even stronger.

111
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:52,441
I don't like anyone
demanding anything from me.

112
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:53,774
Slap instead of snack?

113
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:56,441
Advocate!

114
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,566
Come! Come!

115
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:00,066
This is the Advocate who won my case.
- Namaste, sir.

116
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,107
He's a big shot.

117
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:02,482
A stammering big shot.

118
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,482
Advocate, buy and eat
anything you want.

119
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:06,857
Undampori, Bonda, Bun, anything!

120
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:10,649
I... I...
- You don't want anything, right?

121
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:13,107
I know. You are good at heart.

122
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,024
A... A... A...
- You want to watch an 'Adult' film?

123
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,357
F... F... F...

124
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:20,191
Oh God! You want to
see Fahadh Faasil?

125
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,901
We would have to
go to Alappuzha.

126
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,691
That's okay. We'll send my boys, to
put him in our car & bring him here.

127
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,232
Money? - No need to give him money.
Just say my name.

128
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,566
My fees!

129
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:30,941
Fees?

130
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,482
I won't pay the fees.

131
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:36,816
Whom are you calling?

132
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,691
ACP Vincent.

133
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:40,925
Go ahead, call him.

134
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:42,024
Whom?

135
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:44,524
ACP Vincent.
- Why?

136
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:47,941
H... He asked me to call him
if I don't get the fees.

137
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,941
He's my clo... clo..
- Closet?

138
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:51,982
He's my close friend!

139
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,005
Don't close me by calling
your close friend.

140
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:57,661
Here.
I don't have money to pay your fees.

141
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:58,899
But...

142
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:02,399
I'll arrange a room with a rent of only
 Rs. 2000 per month, for you, Advocate.

143
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:04,357
I don't want a r... room!

144
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,149
Pay my fees in c... cash!

145
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,524
Don't say that, Advocate!

146
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,924
The rent of the room you're staying
in right now, is 6000 Rupees, right?

147
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,857
Moreover, you're yet to pay the
rent for the last 2 months.

148
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,316
I know everything.

149
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:19,232
If the room rent is 2000 Rupees,
how much money would you save?

150
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,857
Around 4000 Rupees.
- 4000 Rupees.

151
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,524
So how much can you
save in a year?

152
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:27,524
48,000 Rupees.

153
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:29,941
If you add 2000 along with it,
how much is it?

154
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,149
Tell me!

155
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,941
50,000.
Youâ€™re so lucky!

156
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,816
You became rich so quickly.

157
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:37,024
I had to be there to get you
a room like this, right?

158
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:38,607
Give me your hand.
We're fixing this.

159
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,941
N.... No advance, right?
- Not at all.

160
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,357
It's direct settlement
over there.

161
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,566
So I'll come and pick
you up in the morning,

162
00:11:45,774 --> 00:11:48,357
to that beautiful place!

163
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:01,107
Hey! Hey!

164
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,316
Unload all the stuff quickly.

165
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:04,607
Okay bro.

166
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:08,357
Take it, man!

167
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,441
Come, Advocate.

168
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:16,024
Give it to me.

169
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,399
Bring them too.

170
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,316
Why did you take the books alone?

171
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,357
I like taking law
into my own hands.

172
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:23,899
Come, son.

173
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:25,232
Move away!

174
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:27,107
Hey!

175
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:32,524
Hey you!

176
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,566
Why are you messing with my dad?

177
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:39,691
Don't make me take my tools in the morning.
Get going!

178
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,524
Take your tools then.
Let me see them!

179
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,482
No, son.
- You shut up, dad!

180
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:46,691
Him and his tools!
I'll sort you out today...

181
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,774
Stop it, dear.

182
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,066
This is our usual game...
Right?

183
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:00,399
Today's game is over.
Now you go to school.

184
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:01,816
Here.
20 Rupees.

185
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,316
But cotton candy after lunch.

186
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:04,899
Get going!
- You get lost!

187
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:23,732
Are you planning to become a dentist?
- Get lost.

188
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:26,482
Good boy!

189
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:34,191
You're a machine that
manufactures goons or what?

190
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:41,857
Advocate, you are lucky!
- W... What?

191
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:43,816
You've seen blood on the
day of your arrival.

192
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:45,441
This is a great place.

193
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,274
You'll be climbing up the
ladder of success hereafter.

194
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:50,024
Why are you all startled?

195
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,274
Is this the first time you're
seeing blood on my face?

196
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:54,232
Is this the first time you're
seeing me lose my teeth?

197
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:55,607
Go inside with the stuff.

198
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:59,857
With all these people plucking my tooth
out, will I become a child again?

199
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:03,359
Is he crazy or what?

200
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:07,107
Poor thing.
Got scared.

201
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,732
This is the general
reaction that I create.

202
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:12,191
W... What about that child?
- He's a child, right? He has no sense.

203
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,816
Get out.
Take this as well.

204
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:18,899
What is this, Beena?
Throwing away after use?

205
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,149
Whose use?
Whose use?

206
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:23,441
My dear Beena, don't
create a ruckus!

207
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:25,149
He thinks he's a Magistrate!

208
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:26,732
What's the matter, Beena?
- Chechi...

209
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,649
He didn't allow me
to sleep last night.

210
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:31,816
When I asked him for the money in the morning,
he's saying he'll pay later. Scoundrel!

211
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:32,857
Don't spare him!

212
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:36,149
I've taken your watch & chain. Bring money
in the evening. I'll return it then.

213
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,649
You're talking as if we
started this yesterday.

214
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:41,024
Give me my chain.
- Leave my hand, you old man!

215
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:44,399
You better bring the money and take
your stuff back in the evening.

216
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:46,899
Beena, shall I intervene?

217
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:49,482
You get lost, you moron!
The 4 feet fellow wants to interfere!

218
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:50,524
Advocate!

219
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:52,649
What are you doing here, Chetta?

220
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,308
What are you doing here, Advocate?
With this mattress and all?

221
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:58,042
So you know that there's no mattress here?

222
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,066
Understood!

223
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,649
Enjoy! Enjoy!

224
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:05,482
Stammering is not a
hindrance for this.

225
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,649
You little devil!

226
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:11,149
Come here.

227
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:14,261
This place is n... n...
- Nice! You need it!

228
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:17,401
Why are you saying that you need it?
I've given it already.

229
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:19,260
This place is t... troublesome.

230
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,576
They are all dangerous people.
- Why be scared? Come on, Advocate.

231
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:24,003
This colony is under my control.

232
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,816
If they know that you're my Advocate,
they would hug you tight.

233
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:29,482
They will shower you with love, and they
might even get you covered in cotton.

234
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:31,232
C.. Cotton?
- Cotton mattress.

235
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:33,882
I was saying that your cotton
mattress is really soft. Come!

236
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,107
How is it?
Awesome, right?

237
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:41,274
This is t... t...
- You can say thanks later.

238
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,607
Not that. Too... Too..
- Too good, right?

239
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:45,203
Thank you!

240
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:46,561
I'll just go out and come.

241
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:47,925
I have an operation.

242
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,118
Operation?
In which hospital?

243
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,685
Don't you know goons' lingo?

244
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,419
Operation, quotation, sketch,
distribution.. All this is our lingo!

245
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:00,075
Do you booze?
- No.

246
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:03,602
Then you should make a black
tea at 6 in the evening.

247
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:07,507
Right before you mix the 2nd spoon
of sugar in it, I will reach here.

248
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,833
In case, I don't reach...

249
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,128
You might have to get
me out on bail again.

250
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:12,162
Okay then!

251
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:16,691
Advocate, you are my Marar, from now on.

252
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:19,024
Nandagopal Marar!

253
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:20,941
[Sings a Mohanlal song]
- Oh no!

254
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,541
Open your eyes, bro!

255
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,482
The operation is confirmed!

256
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:40,779
Stop! Stop!

257
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,191
Stop it, I say!

258
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,899
It's your end today.
You'll play the goon in our colony, huh?

259
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,482
Someone is waiting to see you.

260
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,684
Come on, walk.
- Babuettan has come out.

261
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,101
Look who's here to meet you.
Look!

262
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,086
Babuettan is out of the jail.

263
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,941
Stand straight.

264
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,857
You'll give a witness
statement against Babuettan?

265
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,982
Oh no!
My dear Babuetta...

266
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,575
Please forgive me.
I will never repeat it.

267
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:32,607
To die with this hand, yo...
- You mean Yo Yo?

268
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:34,194
I have to be fortunate, right?

269
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:36,774
I don't want that fortune.
- Babuetta...

270
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:39,274
He has brought an Advocate
to stay in our colony.

271
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:40,732
It is to put us in trouble.

272
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:41,732
Babuetta...

273
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,716
Don't make that Advocate talk.

274
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,786
If he talks, you won't
be able to bear it.

275
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:48,536
P...p... put him into a s... s... sack!

276
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,870
Why?
To ripen me?

277
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,294
Put him in!

278
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,602
If that stammering lawyer
talks to this stammerer,

279
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:55,669
I'll be hammered
by this stammerer.

280
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:11,510
Not that.

281
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,747

we'll never be able to speak again.

00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:08,366
Why are you shaking your head?
Open your mouth and say yes.

351
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:24,199
K... K... K...
- Is this K... K... Kathakali or what?

352
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:28,866
Am I the stammerer or you?

353
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,449
Isn't it for you, B...b... Babuettan?

354
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:32,407
Are you doubting that, you donkey?

355
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:35,574
Are you doing K... K.. Kathakali here?

356
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:37,824
Open your mouth and
say your decision.

357
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:48,282
L... L... Listen, B... B... Babuetta...

358
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:50,282
I... I...

359
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:55,032
I... Immediately...
- Advocate, no!

360
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:34,157
No. Let me try talking to him.

361
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,741
We can move that in court.

362
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:38,907
Okay.

363
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:42,032
Yes.

364
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:45,116
Pramod, if I leave today, I'll
be back only on next 16th.

365
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:46,657
That means, 10 days.

366
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:50,116
Hope you can manage in my absence.
- No issues.

367
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:53,074
When you fix the contract in
Hong Kong, just give me a call.

368
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,032
I will fly down for the
celebration party.

369
00:24:55,907 --> 00:24:57,032
Okay, done!

370
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,699
But I can't wait any longer.

371
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:02,241
You get that statement's draft.
Let me go through it.

372
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:04,449
Of course. Why not?
One minute.

373
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:05,866
Thaddeus!
- Sir!

374
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,366
Isn't Mr. Ronald's statement ready?

375
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:11,907
Sir, just 10 minutes.
It will be ready now.

376
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:12,949
What is this?

377
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:14,699
I gave the content
yesterday itself, right?

378
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:16,492
Why have I employed you then?

379
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:19,282
If I tell you something,
you can't even do it on time.

380
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:20,282
Idiots!

381
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:22,616
Sir, I'll give it now.

382
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:27,444
He asked to submit the final
draft of that statement.

383
00:25:33,076 --> 00:25:34,117
Here it is, Sir.

384
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,285
You may go.
- Sir.

385
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:40,366
Here you go.

386
00:25:54,824 --> 00:25:55,824
Excellent!

387
00:25:56,782 --> 00:25:59,324
To the point, focused and
brilliant, I would say.

388
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:01,407
Thank you.

389
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:03,199
Excuse me...

390
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:04,366
Balakrishnan!

391
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,407
Yes sir.
- You've been missing for 2 days!

392
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:14,032
I... I... I was on leave, sir.

393
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,241
And you're late today as well.

394
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,949
Moreover, you haven't done anything
that I asked you to do, properly.

395
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:21,657
How are you going to
manage this backlog?

396
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,116
Sir...

397
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,449
I... I... I am d... doing it, sir.

398
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:31,816
Come on!

399
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,074
You are getting on my nerves!

400
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:35,741
Go and sit somewhere there.

401
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:37,199
Just be out of my sight.

402
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:43,532
A lawyer with a stutter.

403
00:26:43,824 --> 00:26:44,949
Interesting!

404
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:47,116
What do I say, Mr. Ronald!

405
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,924
My dad's emotional attachments.

406
00:26:49,011 --> 00:26:50,261
He's good for nothing.

407
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:51,324
A moron!

408
00:26:51,424 --> 00:26:54,216
So, the 3 Crores that the
Police caught from me...

409
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,707
We're going to say that it was the
cash reserve maintained legitimately,

410
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:00,874
in different offices of
my group of companies.

411
00:27:00,874 --> 00:27:01,957
Yes.

412
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,791
I need a session with your CFM.

413
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,999
And we might have to
alter the books a bit.

414
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,041
That's not an issue.
I'll ask him to call you.

415
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,416
Anyway...

416
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:11,207
Rock in the court!

417
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:12,749
Thank you.
Safe journey.

418
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:13,791
Yeah. Thank you.

419
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,249
Pramod...

420
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,082
What's that stuttering lawyer's name?

421
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:21,582
Balakrishnan.
What is it, Mr. Ronald?

422
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:22,832
Nothing.

423
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:24,249
He's really funny.

424
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,624
Balakrishnan!

425
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:34,541
S... Sir!

426
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:36,374
You became independent, huh?

427
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,624
Well, I heard that you appeared for
a very complicated case yesterday,

428
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,916
and got the accused out on bail?

429
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:43,175
Well...

430
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:47,374
S... S.... Since I needed
some money urgently...

431
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,041
If you decide to fight cases on your own,
then you are on your own.

432
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:52,249
S... Sorry sir.

433
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:54,374
No explanations.
I don't have time for all that.

434
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:56,582
Get all the other
drafts ready quickly.

435
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:57,582
Understood?

436
00:27:57,749 --> 00:27:58,749
Let's go!

437
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,624
I lost the room I had been
staying in, for years.

438
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:18,166
If I enter the c...colony,
that g...goon will kill me.

439
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:21,291
I'm going home now, because
I'm scared of him.

440
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,541
When I think about coming back on M...
Monday...

441
00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:25,832
Don't come.

442
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:27,457
Well... You can come.

443
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:31,041
Just hang around there for 3-4 days.

444
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:32,999
By then, I'll arrange a place.

445
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:34,707
Until then, please adjust.
What say?

446
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:36,457
(curses)
- You're standing here?

447
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:37,582
Come here.

448
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,499
Hey! Until then, even if I have to move,
I need to stand back on my knees.

449
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,332
Only then I'll have
a mood for that.

450
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:47,374
As long as my dove is alive,
I'll arrange a room for you.

451
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:49,916
Isn't it 'If your c...crane is alive?'?

452
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:51,377
I don't like that bird.

453
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:53,916
Stupid bird.
A creature that stands on one leg.

454
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:56,225
Give it to me, man!
- Hey.. You... d... d... dog!

455
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,416
What?

456
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:59,425
I... I... I was calling him.

457
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:00,749
It came out late.

458
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,332
It won't get late to
take you in (jail).

459
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,957
I don't want to go in again!

460
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,082
[praying to Lord Ram]

461
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,166
Will Sita elope today?

462
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,999
[continues praying to Lord Ram]

463
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,457
Make it in the next episode,
O Lord Ram!

464
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:32,207
M... M... Mom!

465
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:34,957
Can't you say at least the 3 letters
of 'Mom' without stammering?

466
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:36,249
You scared me!

467
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,832
I am n... n...
- Yeah. Go take bath.

468
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:41,791
I am n... not
stammering on purpose.

469
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,666
You're always in front of this TV.

470
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:48,291
Don't you have any other work here?

471
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:49,791
Don't you have any
other work there?

472
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,416
Why do you keep coming
here every week?

473
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,541
You must be the only mom
like this in the world.

474
00:29:56,541 --> 00:30:00,041
Usually mothers keep asking why
their children aren't coming home.

475
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,457
But you ask why I've come,
as soon as I reach.

476
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:05,624
Every time you've come like this,
you have taken money from me every month.

477
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,957
Saying that everything you had was over,
by shuttling back and forth.

478
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:12,791
This month also,
that's a must.

479
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:14,832
N... Nothing!

480
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:17,166
Mom, there's no gruel?

481
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:18,416
Your dad has gone out.

482
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:20,416
Not that... Gruel for dinner!

483
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:23,374
Can't you come home after dinner?

484
00:30:23,832 --> 00:30:26,624
If Sita elopes today,
I'll beat this fellow to death.

485
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:32,124
Does dad have late-night duty today?

486
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,749
He's always in the new resort
that has come up down the valley.

487
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:39,499
His new job is to supply weed and
opium to the foreigners who come there.

488
00:30:40,707 --> 00:30:43,082
I... I have a n.. new
generation father!

489
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:45,374
F... full time high on weed!

490
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:48,541
You also try to freak out with it, mom.
- I'll whack you with this!

491
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:49,749
Your stupid joke!

492
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:50,916
M.... Mom!

493
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:55,499
Even though he's a stoner,
dad is a genius.

494
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:57,374
Despite passing LLB,

495
00:30:57,374 --> 00:31:01,041
he didn't practice law and became a
village officer; and that benefited...

496
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:02,999
those who encroach land here.

497
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:06,874
With the fake documents that dad created,

498
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:11,249
so many businessmen bought
hundreds of acres of land.

499
00:31:12,374 --> 00:31:13,374
Great Father!

500
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,791
That name would suit Mammootty's movie.

501
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,207
But not your father.

502
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,416
Then there's also that fraud.
Your policeman brother-in-law.

503
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:22,249
He keeps coming here often now.

504
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:25,332
And whenever he comes, he brings booze
and weed for his father in law.

505
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:28,874
I don't know when he's going to write
this house & field in your sister's name,

506
00:31:28,874 --> 00:31:30,207
when he's out of his senses.

507
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,957
If he's giving it, let him go ahead, mom!

508
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,499
Why do I need this house and property?

509
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:36,957
Then you go and become a monk!

510
00:31:37,082 --> 00:31:38,999
I would have to do something
like that mostly.

511
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:45,332
My... My sister has to be saluted!

512
00:31:45,624 --> 00:31:48,791
It's been 10 years since she started
living with an unpinned grenade.

513
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:52,207
Compared to your sister,
he's an angel.

514
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:55,332
A male angel.

515
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,749
Was the cow milked?
- In the night?

516
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,374
Finish your food
and get up & go!

517
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,957
When did you reach?

518
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:25,832
S... S... Sometime back.

519
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:27,291
Did you e... eat something, dad?

520
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:28,957
What a question!

521
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:31,249
Didn't you understand by
seeing his condition?

522
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,082
Look at him wearing
ugly sunglasses in the night,

523
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,124
after having all that booze & weed.

524
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:37,791
He's super high!

525
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,749
High is your...
Shut up!

526
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,749
Hey!

527
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:44,957
Intoxication is like...
It's a kind of tripping, man!

528
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,582
A kind of flight!

529
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,999
Did you see the moon there?

530
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:55,207
I can go flying till
there if I want to, now.

531
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:59,082
And after getting there,
I can set foot there like Armstrong.

532
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:01,082
Like.

533
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:03,166
Will your f...feet be
stable to set foot there?

534
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:07,582
Shall I ask the same question to you?

535
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:10,124
Have you become stable, till date?

536
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:11,832
Until this very moment?

537
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:13,999
W... W... Well...

538
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,332
[Mimics stammering]

539
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,166
A junior for your entire lifetime!

540
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:21,541
That means a slave... or a servant!

541
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,582
Can you please stop it?
- You stop!

542
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:24,791
Hey!

543
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:27,874
Everyone gets one opportunity
in life, to succeed.

544
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,957
An intelligent person will make
use of it to achieve success.

545
00:33:31,332 --> 00:33:33,207
And we would call him
a fortunate person.

546
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:38,291
So many such opportunities kept
coming to you, several times.

547
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,957
You ignored all of them.

548
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:42,874
Why?

549
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:44,749
Inferiority complex!

550
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:46,207
Low self esteem!

551
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:49,791
Pity on you, my son!

552
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:53,457
As if you're a great man who made use of
opportunities. Look at you, high on opium!

553
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,249
What's wrong with opium (black)?
- Nothing.

554
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,916
Is there white without black?

555
00:33:56,957 --> 00:34:00,374
Truth is a mixture of black and white.
That's what has value.

556
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,207
Can you please come to bed, man?

557
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,582
You're in the mood to get on bed, huh?

558
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:09,374
A cold and cozy full moon
night with mist all around.

559
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:11,999
And I'm really intoxicated.

560
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:14,041
This is all an illusion, man!

561
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,999
The reality is frightening, man!

562
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:18,374
I have to go to bed with her, right?

563
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:20,916
Pity me, my son!

564
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:23,291
What all nonsense is this man saying?

565
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,957
Mom, you go inside.

566
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:25,999
Yeah, go!

567
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:28,124
Go! Go and sleep!

568
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:30,916
It's useless even
if she stays awake.

569
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:33,473
D...Dad, you also go to s...sleep!

570
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:35,983
What's wrong with him?

571
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:41,082
What are you going to do here alone?

572
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:44,541
D...Didn't you s...say earlier?

573
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,832
What if some opportunity like
that knocks my door in the night?

574
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:50,582
I will wait.

575
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:52,957
Sarcasm!

576
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,707
Should I ask you to hold me?

577
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,515
'In this cozy night, with
the aroma of flowers'

578
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,156
'It would have been great to sleep with
someone else' - Why don't you go then?

579
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:13,579
My boy is outside. Otherwise I'd
have given you a proper reply!

580
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:36,832
'O moon of the cold night'

581
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:42,166
'With your cozy little finger'

582
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:48,791
'Come slowly beside this window,
and give me dreams'

583
00:35:48,832 --> 00:35:51,124
Well, don't you have any
cases now, Advocate?

584
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:56,207
G... Get going!
Go, return this glass.

585
00:35:56,291 --> 00:36:02,082
'Give me the song of the full moon, in
this nest where the morning bird perches'

586
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:08,166
'A vessel full of wise and pure words'

587
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:13,416
'As a sprout of virtue by the field'

588
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:23,416
'Here is a village that
always spreads smiles'

589
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:42,517
Hey! Don't take me.
It's not me. It's the old man who's mad.

590
00:36:42,874 --> 00:36:44,166
Don't take me.

591
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:47,967
Get lost!

592
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,082
Some poor lad!

593
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,082
Some ogler!

594
00:36:55,874 --> 00:37:05,749
'Are sun rays shining on
my lonely shadow path?'

595
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:15,874
'Are all my sorrows swimming
in the river of joy at times?'

596
00:37:19,332 --> 00:37:21,249
Can you give me 1000 Rupees?

597
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:23,999
Write it down.

598
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,416
Even if you throw something away to the
sea, you should measure it. - Get lost!

599
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:30,574
Careful!

600
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,707
Not that one!

601
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:36,582
'Rushing through the valleys with the
folk song, can you come again, O breeze?'

602
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:40,041
'A vessel full of wise and pure words'

603
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:41,082
Dad!

604
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:47,166
'As a sprout of virtue by the field'

605
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:58,166
'Here is a village that
always spreads smiles'

606
00:38:11,512 --> 00:38:12,777
Give me money!

607
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,832
I don't have cash. That's why.
Please adjust.

608
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:22,082
Advocate Balan...

609
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:23,749
I won that lottery.

610
00:38:23,957 --> 00:38:25,332
Your hands are very lucky!

611
00:38:25,332 --> 00:38:26,416
Drive, boy!

612
00:38:26,457 --> 00:38:28,707
Your move, Advocate.
- M... M... I lost the mood.

613
00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:33,874
'A vessel full of wise and pure words'

614
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:38,874
'As a sprout of virtue by the field'

615
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:50,275
'Here is a village that
always spreads smiles'

616
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:57,041
Hi. Good morning, brother in law!

617
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,249
Look.

618
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:01,916
Good morning, sir.
I am Nimisha.

619
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:03,874
Why are you in a hurry?

620
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,832
There's a bus at 8.10 AM.

621
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:09,166
Let the bus go. We can go in the car. I've
come with a set up good enough for that.

622
00:39:09,582 --> 00:39:10,582
Come.

623
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:13,207
Sorry.

624
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:15,499
Bro, please give a
moment to that Nimisha.

625
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,249
My dear.... brother in law!

626
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:21,916
I've told you several times not to bring
such f... - Hey! Ladies are here!

627
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,082
Fraud cases to me!

628
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:26,082
This is not a fraud case, bro.
It's a big lottery.

629
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:28,082
I've fixed the fees as 1 Lakh.

630
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:30,624
Just give me 75K or something..
You can keep the rest!

631
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:36,082
I cannot attend that
w...woman's divorce case!

632
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,624
How did you understand
that it's a divorce case?

633
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:42,166
Well...

634
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:47,916
She has kept her wedding chain's locket
behind her neck, so that no one sees it.

635
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:49,832
Wedding locket?

636
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:58,041
She picked up telephone bills of
the past 2 years from the floor.

637
00:40:02,082 --> 00:40:06,082
It's the evidence that she has been
living separately from her husband.

638
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:07,707
Get going, bro!

639
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,041
The stammerer is so sharp!

640
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:12,332
Bro!
 Oh no!

641
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:15,749
Sorry! What's this roadblock?
Hey stammerer!

642
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,041
I mean.. Brother in law!

643
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,957
Who are you, dad?
I mean, where are you coming from, dad?

644
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:22,291
Are you still in service?
Or suspended?

645
00:40:22,374 --> 00:40:24,666
I am in service.
I just got back on this 10th.

646
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,082
Then I need a favour from you.

647
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:31,666
I need one from you too.

648
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:33,124
Come.
- I will.

649
00:40:39,624 --> 00:40:40,707
Check and tell me.

650
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:49,957
Dad!

651
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:54,749
Dad!

652
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:56,541
Dad!

653
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,374
Bring her to the next room.

654
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,916
The deceased is your father, right?

655
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:06,249
Yes.

656
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:09,041
Just tell them his name and age.
Note it down.

657
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:11,916
Sudarshan.

658
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:13,541
58 years.

659
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:16,082
What was Sudarshan's job?

660
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,999
Dad was working in a
wing security agency.

661
00:41:20,957 --> 00:41:22,332
He's also an ex-service man.

662
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,207
Who else is there at home?

663
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:25,499
M...

664
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:27,874
Dad's second wife.

665
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:30,582
Did he have any
children with her?

666
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:31,999
A younger brother.

667
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:35,124
Your complaint says that he has
been missing for 3 days, right?

668
00:41:36,124 --> 00:41:37,124
Yes.

669
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:39,332
Dad had gone to Trivandrum
to meet someone.

670
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:41,999
I don't know what
happened after that.

671
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:44,457
The accident happened on Thursday night.

672
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,207
It must have happened while he
was on his way back home,

673
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:48,707
after reaching here
from Trivandrum.

674
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:52,041
We didn't find any personal
belongings from his body.

675
00:41:52,707 --> 00:41:55,832
Purse, mobile...
Your dad never used these or what?

676
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,166
He did.

677
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:58,707
Didn't you find them?

678
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,082
No.

679
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:02,166
You informed your family, right?

680
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:08,835
I'll make arrangements to release
the body after all the formalities.

681
00:42:13,374 --> 00:42:14,374
Okay sir.

682
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,457
Th... Thi... Thi...
- This is your dad.

683
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:22,749
What is dad doing here?

684
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,874
Dad told me everything after you left
yesterday. He's in a total mess.

685
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:30,999
The resort he always hangs out in?
There was a police raid there last night.

686
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:36,082
10-12 kilos of elk meat and 1.5
kilos of marijuana were caught.

687
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:38,916
Along with those involved,
they said dad's name as well.

688
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:41,624
They said that for a confidence.
- Yeah, right.

689
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:43,541
Because of my connection with the MLA,

690
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:46,916
they thought they could get away
easily if my name was also there.

691
00:42:47,457 --> 00:42:50,082
No MLA would interfere
in such a case, bro.

692
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:54,832
With my connection with the SI and
CI there, I've settled the problem.

693
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:56,457
But they are policemen, right?

694
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,874
We would have to pay them.

695
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:00,957
They asked for 5..
We will have to give at least 3.

696
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,416
That too, today.
Or else....

697
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:05,666
They will charge a case,
and dad will be an accused.

698
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:09,582
I've never asked you for
any help till date, right?

699
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:12,624
Borrow 3 Lakhs from somewhere
and give it to me.

700
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:14,624
I need it within 1-1.5 hours.

701
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,916
It's because I have no other option.

702
00:43:17,249 --> 00:43:18,999
I'll write that house in your name.

703
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:20,582
How's that possible?

704
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:24,207
Would you have so
much money to roll? No, right?

705
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:25,416
Yeah.

706
00:43:25,707 --> 00:43:27,249
How will I have so much money, dad?

707
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:30,374
I don't have any such c...connections
with anyone as well.

708
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:35,916
Didn't I tell you that we needn't
waste time by coming here?

709
00:43:36,082 --> 00:43:38,499
Whatever we ask, he keeps stammering.

710
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:41,374
I can't get any help from
him in this lifetime.

711
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:42,749
It's all right.

712
00:43:42,832 --> 00:43:44,207
I'll go to jail for some time.

713
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:45,332
Come.

714
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,666
You needn't go to jail now, dad.

715
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,416
I don't need the house
on mortgage as well.

716
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:53,041
I'll arrange the money
myself & pay them.

717
00:43:53,582 --> 00:43:54,582
But....

718
00:43:54,624 --> 00:43:55,624
Come here.

719
00:43:55,832 --> 00:43:57,541
I'm saying this in front of your dad...

720
00:43:57,749 --> 00:44:02,166
Instead of making stupid excuses,
you should do something for me.

721
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:03,416
Do you agree?

722
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:06,374
Or else, dad will go to jail.
That will be really sad.

723
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,582
Whatever the f...
- Dad is here. Don't swear.

724
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,582
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

725
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:16,457
If so, you will come to Vrindavan
restaurant today evening at 4 PM.

726
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:19,207
We'll discuss after having a
coffee & Masala Dosa over there.

727
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,082
Is that the m... matter?

728
00:44:21,082 --> 00:44:22,666
I'll tell you the matter over there.

729
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,414
He's my own brother in law.
He'll come now.

730
00:44:33,814 --> 00:44:34,814
Sit.

731
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:35,934
Just a minute.

732
00:44:36,654 --> 00:44:38,094
Shall I order Masala Dosa for you?

733
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:39,534
Say whatever it is.

734
00:44:39,574 --> 00:44:41,694
One Masala Dosa, please.
- No. Tell me the matter.

735
00:44:41,814 --> 00:44:43,894
Cancel the Masala Dosa.
Bring my soup alone.

736
00:44:45,774 --> 00:44:46,774
Just a minute.

737
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:49,374
CI Sir.
Must be to swear at me.

738
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:52,774
Hello sir.

739
00:44:53,534 --> 00:44:54,534
Yes, sir.
- Advocate!

740
00:44:55,254 --> 00:44:56,374
FIR...
- Money!

741
00:44:57,414 --> 00:44:58,934
I'm enquiring about that, sir.
- Money!

742
00:44:59,014 --> 00:45:00,934
Don't swear at me like this, sir. Please.
- Get lost!

743
00:45:00,974 --> 00:45:01,974
You get lost!

744
00:45:03,014 --> 00:45:04,014
Just a minute, sir.

745
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:06,054
Whom did you say 'Get lost' to?
- To him.

746
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:09,894
Sorry sir.

747
00:45:09,894 --> 00:45:14,054
Someone said 'Get lost' to someone here.
So I also said 'Get lost' for a company.

748
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:16,454
Yes, sir. I'll come in person
and get sworn at personally.

749
00:45:16,454 --> 00:45:17,854
I swear on God.
Trust me, sir.

750
00:45:18,414 --> 00:45:19,414
Okay sir.

751
00:45:23,094 --> 00:45:24,094
Why have you come now?

752
00:45:24,574 --> 00:45:26,814
Why have you come?
- Didn't you ask me to come?

753
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:27,934
Is it?
- Yes.

754
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:29,214
Oh yeah! That's true.

755
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,854
Well, did you see the girl sitting there?

756
00:45:32,894 --> 00:45:35,694
She sent an application for a
job, seeing a newspaper ad.

757
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:36,934
She was called for
an interview too.

758
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,254
The interview was at the company
owner's house on Sunday evening.

759
00:45:40,294 --> 00:45:42,494
When this girl went there,
there was no one else there.

760
00:45:42,814 --> 00:45:46,214
In the name of the interview, he took her
into a room, and laid his hands on her.

761
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:50,094
After slapping him,
she came directly to me.

762
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:57,854
The problem is that, the incident
didn't happen in my station limit.

763
00:45:58,174 --> 00:45:59,694
She doesn't know that either.

764
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:03,534
After listening to
everything, I told her...

765
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:06,054
Dear, I can write an FIR and
charge a case if you want me to...

766
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:09,414
But the case and trial would
take a couple of years.

767
00:46:09,694 --> 00:46:10,974
Your life will be ruined.

768
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:14,694
So you're saying that I
shouldn't do anything?

769
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:15,734
Not like that.

770
00:46:16,014 --> 00:46:17,454
There's a section in law.

771
00:46:17,934 --> 00:46:20,614
You can send a legal notice
against that company owner.

772
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:23,374
Asking compensation for
the insult you faced.

773
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:24,414
Got it?

774
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,094
We can ask up to One Crore.
He's a big shot, right?

775
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:32,854
I've settled it by quoting
50% of whatever she gets.

776
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:37,294
You should send an awesome legal
notice to that boss, for this girl.

777
00:46:37,574 --> 00:46:39,494
He should shit his pants in fear.

778
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,534
Bro, this is not ethical.
- Who said it's not ethical?

779
00:46:45,814 --> 00:46:47,614
Only I know how I
got it till here!

780
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:49,654
N... No.. Not that ethical.

781
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:51,254
Then?
- It's not legal.

782
00:46:52,414 --> 00:46:55,254
You should have written an
FIR & registered a case!

783
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:59,654
I told you there itself, not to say
unwanted stuff after coming here.

784
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:02,734
Let your dad go to jail.
Why do I care?

785
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:04,734
I will send the notice.

786
00:47:08,654 --> 00:47:10,894
Why are you sitting there all alone?
Come & sit here.

787
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:14,774
Sit.

788
00:47:15,254 --> 00:47:16,574
Sir, soup.
- Thank you.

789
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,494
This is our Advocate.
I've told him everything.

790
00:47:20,814 --> 00:47:23,334
If you want to ask her any details,
go ahead.

791
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:26,814
This is the complaint I had written to
give Sir. This has all the details.

792
00:47:28,534 --> 00:47:31,254
This has both his and your
addresses, right? - Yes.

793
00:47:34,214 --> 00:47:35,214
One minute.

794
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,894
What is it, Sir?
- Can you taste this soup, please?

795
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:40,094
If there's any problem,
I'll get it changed.

796
00:47:40,174 --> 00:47:41,534
No. Please taste it.

797
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:46,334
No spoon?
- Am I supposed to bring that?

798
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:49,374
Sorry Sir.
I'll bring it now.

799
00:47:50,814 --> 00:47:52,254
He's taking the soup also.

800
00:47:53,494 --> 00:47:54,494
Sorry.

801
00:47:54,574 --> 00:47:56,214
Do you want to know
anything further, Sir?

802
00:47:56,254 --> 00:47:57,534
This is enough.

803
00:47:58,294 --> 00:47:59,574
It has my mobile number.

804
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:01,054
Call me if you need anything.

805
00:48:01,214 --> 00:48:03,334
No. That won't be necessary.

806
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:05,814
I'll do it tomorrow morning itself.

807
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:07,054
Okay.

808
00:48:08,294 --> 00:48:09,814
So we'll meet again!

809
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,734
B...Babuettan's people
had come today as well.

810
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:40,494
They cursed me a lot.

811
00:48:40,854 --> 00:48:43,614
I must shift to some other place.

812
00:48:44,934 --> 00:48:46,414
Other than f...f...

813
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:47,694
Don't swear when I'm eating.

814
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:50,454
feasting on my cash,
you're not helping me in any way.

815
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,414
But this is not a feast.
It's just Masala Dosa!

816
00:48:53,374 --> 00:48:54,534
You are the limit!

817
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:00,094
Hello!

818
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:03,814
Hello! B... B...  Balakrishnan!

819
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:07,094
No.

820
00:49:07,534 --> 00:49:09,694
No. I haven't sent it.

821
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:15,054
They are trying to fool
me in the morning itself.

822
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:16,574
It was from a TV Channel.

823
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,974
Asking me if I sent a
legal notice to the DGP.

824
00:49:20,014 --> 00:49:21,574
You?
To the DGP?

825
00:49:23,174 --> 00:49:24,654
One plate of 'Puttu' & beef.

826
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:28,014
Don't worry.
I'm not going to eat it.

827
00:49:28,294 --> 00:49:29,294
I'm packing it for lunch.

828
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:32,494
Well...

829
00:49:32,734 --> 00:49:35,574
I think someone who doesn't have any
idea about your range had called.

830
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:39,054
Will there be any good advocates
named Balakrishnan?

831
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:44,214
Y... Yes.

832
00:49:46,294 --> 00:49:47,294
Balakrishnan.

833
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:49,094
I... I'll slap you!

834
00:49:49,094 --> 00:49:50,974
I'll lose the flow in eating.
That's why.

835
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:53,694
Yes. B... B... B...

836
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,494
It's me.

837
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:02,094
To the DGP?

838
00:50:04,494 --> 00:50:05,854
What are you saying?

839
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:08,614
Anuradha...

840
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:10,174
That one...

841
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:12,734
I... I... I sent it.

842
00:50:16,654 --> 00:50:17,734
To the DGP?

843
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:21,254
To the actual DGP?

844
00:50:29,054 --> 00:50:30,414
Just a second...

845
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:35,334
She has sent a legal notice to the DGP
seeking compensation of 1 Crore Rupees,

846
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:37,094
for physical and mental harassment.

847
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:41,014
It was Advocate S. Balakrishnan who
sent the legal notice for the lady.

848
00:50:41,014 --> 00:50:43,054
You're one a different
level now, Advocate!

849
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:46,494
A notice against the DGP?
That too for sexual harassment?

850
00:50:47,094 --> 00:50:49,094
Now you won't have time
to stay on the floor.

851
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,614
A young lady who applied for the job,
is the complainant.

852
00:50:55,934 --> 00:50:59,574
But no one else was present
there, apart from DGP Eapen.

853
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:02,054
Over there, Eapen tried to molest her...

854
00:51:02,214 --> 00:51:04,334
Hey! Give me your phone.

855
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,694
It doesn't have balance, Advocate.

856
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:09,414
The legal notice seeking 1 Crore compensation
was sent to his house in Mundakkayam.

857
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:12,374
It has to be noted that it
wasn't to his official address.

858
00:51:16,414 --> 00:51:17,414
Hello!

859
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:18,734
Bro...

860
00:51:19,094 --> 00:51:20,494
What's this on TV?

861
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:22,694
The news...
- N... News!

862
00:51:22,974 --> 00:51:24,734
I also have no idea, bro.

863
00:51:25,054 --> 00:51:27,334
That girl has put us in royal trouble!

864
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:30,614
Does anyone know the address
of DGP's ancestral house?

865
00:51:30,814 --> 00:51:32,534
She was trapping us, bro.

866
00:51:32,574 --> 00:51:34,014
Everything she said was a lie.

867
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:37,694
What should I... I do now?

868
00:51:37,734 --> 00:51:39,494
How do I know that?
But one thing.

869
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:42,974
I have no connection at all
with this legal notice.

870
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:45,494
What?
How's that possible?

871
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:48,254
Don't stutter in vain, bro.
Listen to me.

872
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,574
ADGP will arrest you soon.

873
00:51:52,014 --> 00:51:53,014
Bro...

874
00:51:54,454 --> 00:51:55,974
You were cheating me, huh?

875
00:51:56,534 --> 00:52:00,694
My dear bro, I did this thinking that your
sister would get a huge sum of money.

876
00:52:00,734 --> 00:52:02,814
How would I know that this
would be such a big mess?

877
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:06,814
Realizing that I'm your brother in law,
ADGP has called me also to the Police Club.

878
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,814
Now everything is in your hands.

879
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,334
Okay bro!

880
00:52:11,774 --> 00:52:13,014
H... Hello!
Hello!

881
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:15,214
Ran out of balance.

882
00:52:16,054 --> 00:52:17,574
Start the car.
- Where to?

883
00:52:18,294 --> 00:52:20,014
The police is looking for me.

884
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:22,694
I need some time to think.

885
00:52:23,614 --> 00:52:27,014
Let's go to the Court.
The police can't catch me from there.

886
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:28,214
Hey!

887
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:29,494
The bill!

888
00:52:39,414 --> 00:52:40,774
Stop! Stop!

889
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:45,414
Get down.

890
00:52:48,654 --> 00:52:50,094
Thought you could escape?

891
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,374
We've kept surveillance cameras
on the roads, for all this only.

892
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:54,654
Come.
Get into the vehicle.

893
00:52:55,094 --> 00:52:57,574
Advocate, come.
We need to record your statement.

894
00:52:58,014 --> 00:52:59,614
I... I... did... didn't...

895
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:01,214
Come. Get in.
- Move.

896
00:53:03,094 --> 00:53:04,094
Make way.

897
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:05,654
Move.

898
00:53:12,294 --> 00:53:14,494
No point in saying that he's SI
Mohanan Pillai's brother in law.

899
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:17,294
Since ADGP Madam is involved
directly, no one else can...

900
00:53:18,374 --> 00:53:20,254
Sir, shall I talk to my brother in law?

901
00:53:20,294 --> 00:53:22,294
I'll ask him to co-operate with us.

902
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:24,494
Make it fast.
Madam will call him inside now.

903
00:53:24,574 --> 00:53:25,614
Okay sir.
Come.

904
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:30,014
W...Why are t..they...
- Don't ask me anything.

905
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:32,854
Whatever happens,
don't say my name.

906
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:34,614
I have no idea about anything.

907
00:53:35,814 --> 00:53:39,414
The girl came to you directly with the
complaint, and you sent the notice.

908
00:53:40,414 --> 00:53:42,814
You didn't know that this
KE Eapen was the DGP,

909
00:53:42,814 --> 00:53:47,014
and that you were sending the
notice to his ancestral house.

910
00:53:47,854 --> 00:53:49,214
No more confusions.

911
00:53:49,574 --> 00:53:53,414
Even if the police shoves their rods up
your bottom, you should stay strong.

912
00:53:54,494 --> 00:53:57,054
Or else, all our lives
would become like this.

913
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:00,294
You don't say anything.
Our family is most important for us.

914
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:03,414
Your sister's, your father's
and your brother in law's.

915
00:54:04,254 --> 00:54:05,374
Be careful, okay?

916
00:54:06,774 --> 00:54:08,414
Sir, he said he will co-operate.

917
00:54:08,414 --> 00:54:09,414
Good.

918
00:54:10,734 --> 00:54:12,414
God! Save that poor fellow.

919
00:54:17,094 --> 00:54:19,614
A girl called Anuradha came to meet you...

920
00:54:19,774 --> 00:54:24,734
She asks you to send a legal notice against
one Mr. KE Eapen, who tried to molest her.

921
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:25,934
Is that what happened?

922
00:54:35,254 --> 00:54:36,414
Nodding your head?

923
00:54:36,854 --> 00:54:38,094
Say yes or no.

924
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:40,934
Y... Y... Yes.

925
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:42,574
Where did she meet you?

926
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:46,094
My o...o...

927
00:54:46,614 --> 00:54:48,214
At the place where I stay.

928
00:54:49,254 --> 00:54:52,694
When there are so many other good
advocates, what's the reason she chose you?

929
00:54:55,374 --> 00:54:58,054
That too, to a place where a girl
would feel afraid to come alone,

930
00:54:58,214 --> 00:55:01,814
a colony where only criminals
& anti-socials are staying.

931
00:55:03,294 --> 00:55:05,254
Why are you staying at such a place?

932
00:55:05,814 --> 00:55:07,254
That shows his character, Madam.

933
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:09,894
Even this stammering is
an act he has put up.

934
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:13,214
He will get time to think
before saying anything.

935
00:55:14,214 --> 00:55:15,614
Bring her in.
- Yes, Madam.

936
00:56:03,487 --> 00:56:07,207
Is this your client who asked you to
send a legal notice?

937
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:08,694
Anuradha Sudarshan?

938
00:56:21,054 --> 00:56:23,454
Didn't you hear what Madam
asked, brother in law? Tell her.

939
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:26,534
Mohanan Pillai, you can keep
your relations back home.

940
00:56:27,854 --> 00:56:28,934
Tell me, Balakrishnan.

941
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:30,614
Don't trouble us.

942
00:56:32,294 --> 00:56:33,294
This...

943
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:34,934
This gi....

944
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:36,734
girl...

945
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:40,534
Yes, Madam.
This is my c...client.

946
00:56:40,534 --> 00:56:42,374
Hey! What are you saying?

947
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:44,494
This is not true, Madam.

948
00:56:44,494 --> 00:56:46,614
I don't know him.
I swear!

949
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:48,414
This is my c... client.

950
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:50,334
No, Madam. He is..
- Wait.

951
00:56:51,254 --> 00:56:52,254
Balakrishnan,

952
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,494
did you send the notice
because she asked you to?

953
00:56:54,934 --> 00:56:55,934
Yes.

954
00:56:56,174 --> 00:57:00,414
Did she tell you that it was the State
Police Chief who tried to molest her?

955
00:57:01,014 --> 00:57:02,014
No.

956
00:57:02,094 --> 00:57:04,494
During the interview, a Bo..
 - Bo?

957
00:57:04,494 --> 00:57:08,214
A boss called her home on a Sunday and..
- Cut the crap!

958
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:11,854
You trusted her blindly and sent a notice?

959
00:57:12,414 --> 00:57:13,854
You'll do anything for money?

960
00:57:14,574 --> 00:57:17,174
Mohanan Pillai, why is your
brother in law like this?

961
00:57:18,654 --> 00:57:22,894
Madam, since he has a stammer, he hasn't
been able to make a mark in this profession.

962
00:57:23,414 --> 00:57:27,694
He lives off such second rate cases
which he gets once in a while.

963
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:30,734
He's not very efficient.

964
00:57:31,654 --> 00:57:33,174
Can't we let him go?
- Huh?

965
00:57:34,014 --> 00:57:37,294
Can we let him go for just this one time?
We can't?

966
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,974
Are you even a policeman?

967
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:41,734
Vincent!
- Yes, Madam.

968
00:57:43,414 --> 00:57:44,934
Do you know this
Balakrishnan for long?

969
00:57:45,454 --> 00:57:46,454
Yes, Madam.

970
00:57:46,494 --> 00:57:47,814
He was my junior in Law College.

971
00:57:47,894 --> 00:57:49,054
Is he clean?

972
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:50,774
To the best of my knowledge.

973
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:53,774
He won't play such a big game,
deliberately.

974
00:57:54,894 --> 00:57:57,374
We cannot detain a lawyer like this.

975
00:57:57,814 --> 00:57:59,094
What wrong did he do?

976
00:57:59,654 --> 00:58:01,334
A client went to him.
- Yes.

977
00:58:01,374 --> 00:58:03,734
He sent a notice,
without a detailed enquiry.

978
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,334
But the media is very vigilant.

979
00:58:06,694 --> 00:58:10,334
So let him go saying that he
should come whenever we call him.

980
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,094
But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, Madam.

981
00:58:14,254 --> 00:58:17,294
Balakrishnan, you may go now.
You would have to come anytime we call you.

982
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:19,054
Thank you sir.

983
00:58:22,814 --> 00:58:23,934
Balakrishnan!

984
00:58:24,894 --> 00:58:27,014
Don't go and stutter
in front of the media.

985
00:58:27,414 --> 00:58:28,414
You get me?

986
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,214
Who is this girl, bro?

987
00:58:41,494 --> 00:58:44,494
So who was that girl
I introduced to you?

988
00:58:45,454 --> 00:58:50,094
Anyway, you dealt it by saying that this
is the same girl, right? That was great.

989
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:52,694
So you should deal everything
that happens hereafter.

990
00:58:54,414 --> 00:58:55,534
Your sister! Sister!

991
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:11,374
Let me talk to the DG, CM.

992
00:59:14,774 --> 00:59:16,214
I will do the needful.

993
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,494
Even you know that it wouldn't
have happened, right CM?

994
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:23,254
I'll call you back.

995
00:59:25,214 --> 00:59:26,214
What is this, Eapen?

996
00:59:26,414 --> 00:59:27,414
What's happening?

997
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:29,734
Sir, I'm totally at a loss.

998
00:59:31,014 --> 00:59:33,454
The day this incident supposedly happened,
I was in Kottayam.

999
00:59:34,494 --> 00:59:35,494
You know, right?

1000
00:59:36,014 --> 00:59:37,734
I had called the range
IG on that day.

1001
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:41,654
Sir, it was a meeting of all the
station officers in the district.

1002
00:59:42,414 --> 00:59:43,414
I know that.

1003
00:59:43,774 --> 00:59:47,014
But after lunch, you had
gone somewhere, right?

1004
00:59:47,374 --> 00:59:48,374
Alone...

1005
00:59:48,694 --> 00:59:49,854
In your own car?

1006
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:54,694
Sir, it was my close friend's
daughter's wedding the next day.

1007
00:59:55,494 --> 00:59:57,414
So I went to attend the
wedding eve function.

1008
00:59:58,374 --> 01:00:01,414
When I go for such personal needs,
I avoid the escort usually.

1009
01:00:01,454 --> 01:00:03,934
You avoided the gun man
also that day, right?

1010
01:00:04,294 --> 01:00:06,334
Why are you asking such a
pointed question, Sir?

1011
01:00:08,014 --> 01:00:10,334
It is said in that girl's
legal notice that...

1012
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:12,614
as part of an interview
for a job at the company,

1013
01:00:12,614 --> 01:00:14,534
which has your wife as the director,

1014
01:00:14,534 --> 01:00:18,694
you invited her to your ancestral
house and tried to molest her.

1015
01:00:18,814 --> 01:00:22,054
It's only a 45 minute journey
between Kottayam & Mundakkayam.

1016
01:00:22,694 --> 01:00:24,214
This is plain accusation, sir.

1017
01:00:27,854 --> 01:00:28,854
Now I've understood...

1018
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:32,934
What's happening against me is a
conspiracy with clear goals.

1019
01:00:34,374 --> 01:00:36,614
With ample support from the top.

1020
01:00:37,094 --> 01:00:38,094
Now...

1021
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,094
That is also an insinuation.

1022
01:00:41,454 --> 01:00:42,814
I'll tell you my decision.

1023
01:00:43,414 --> 01:00:47,494
ADGP Indulekha will investigate the
complaint against you by that girl.

1024
01:00:47,574 --> 01:00:48,934
You can go on leave for now.

1025
01:00:49,334 --> 01:00:52,214
Rest we can decide once the CM is back.

1026
01:00:56,494 --> 01:00:58,254
I won't be finished with all this, sir.

1027
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,094
I have survived worse.

1028
01:01:07,088 --> 01:01:10,001
Anyway, she has a privileged status now.

1029
01:01:10,072 --> 01:01:11,338
That of the victim.

1030
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:12,783
And the accused is our Chief.

1031
01:01:12,978 --> 01:01:15,947
If we hold her here,
media will interpret it in different ways.

1032
01:01:16,135 --> 01:01:17,401
That's true, Madam.

1033
01:01:18,014 --> 01:01:19,294
We'll let her go now.

1034
01:01:19,694 --> 01:01:21,334
But she should be under
our surveillance.

1035
01:01:21,334 --> 01:01:22,694
We'll keep a close watch on her.

1036
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:26,054
We need a clear plan of action hereafter.

1037
01:01:26,414 --> 01:01:29,014
Vincent, leave her after
getting a written statement.

1038
01:01:29,054 --> 01:01:30,054
Sir.

1039
01:01:30,094 --> 01:01:35,334
We're at the residence of Advocate Balakrishnan,
who sent the legal notice to the DGP..

1040
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:38,254
Here comes the Advocate!
We're leading a decent life here.

1041
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,094
This is happening for
the first time here.

1042
01:01:43,774 --> 01:01:45,814
What are you doing on TV, man?

1043
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:49,014
I... I... I... I'll do it.

1044
01:01:49,054 --> 01:01:51,094
You've reached?

1045
01:01:51,294 --> 01:01:54,094
Let him finish his call.
Babuettan will meet you personally.

1046
01:01:54,174 --> 01:01:55,934
The colony is full of people
from TV Channels & newspapers.

1047
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:58,614
You won't allow us to make
a living doing our jobs?

1048
01:01:58,654 --> 01:01:59,694
Sir, what do you have
to say about this?

1049
01:01:59,854 --> 01:02:02,214
[indistinct questions from media]

1050
01:02:38,374 --> 01:02:42,374
Advocate Balakrishnan is staying
in a notorious colony in the city.

1051
01:02:42,414 --> 01:02:46,974
There's information that Balakrishnan &
goons of the city have secret connections.

1052
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:49,254
Balakrishnan is weak
and disappointed.

1053
01:02:49,254 --> 01:02:53,734
We can see now that Advocate Balakrishnan
is under immense mental pressure.

1054
01:02:53,734 --> 01:02:55,854
He is drinking water now.

1055
01:02:56,254 --> 01:02:59,734
We are bringing those live
visuals to the viewers now.

1056
01:03:21,454 --> 01:03:22,454
Move away.

1057
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:31,534
The girl who has complained
against the DGP...

1058
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:36,294
That is, the 'Victim' in this case,
has come to meet her lawyer Balakrishnan.

1059
01:03:36,374 --> 01:03:39,014
They are discussing behind closed doors.

1060
01:03:39,094 --> 01:03:42,934
Anyway, we can clearly guess what
they are discussing about, Rohini.

1061
01:03:43,214 --> 01:03:44,374
Didn't you hear what I asked?

1062
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,414
Have you seen me before this?

1063
01:03:46,414 --> 01:03:47,414
Anywhere at all?

1064
01:03:47,814 --> 01:03:48,814
Even for a minute?

1065
01:03:54,814 --> 01:03:56,294
So it's a no, right?

1066
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,734
Then why did you lie to the police?

1067
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:01,734
You know what?

1068
01:04:02,054 --> 01:04:04,414
You ruined my life with that lie.

1069
01:04:05,694 --> 01:04:07,614
I had only my father.

1070
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:11,534
You humiliated me in front of the society,
on the 2nd day after my father's funeral.

1071
01:04:13,494 --> 01:04:16,374
I don't understand why
you're playing such a drama,

1072
01:04:16,574 --> 01:04:19,094
with the life of a girl like
me, who's worth nothing!

1073
01:04:19,894 --> 01:04:21,654
Keep one thing in mind.

1074
01:04:22,094 --> 01:04:23,574
I was ready to die.

1075
01:04:23,974 --> 01:04:24,974
But not anymore.

1076
01:04:26,094 --> 01:04:29,534
I will make you answer for
cheating me like this.

1077
01:04:30,294 --> 01:04:32,334
Wherever you go,
I'll be with you.

1078
01:04:33,374 --> 01:04:34,734
I won't leave you.

1079
01:04:36,294 --> 01:04:37,574
You're my advocate, right?

1080
01:04:37,814 --> 01:04:38,974
The saviour of the 'Victim'.

1081
01:04:39,454 --> 01:04:41,054
I will make you say...

1082
01:04:41,334 --> 01:04:44,094
that you made up a
false case in my name.

1083
01:04:44,534 --> 01:04:47,574
and who all are behind this conspiracy
 the police is talking about.

1084
01:04:48,854 --> 01:04:52,094
I will do at least this for my
father who lived and died for me.

1085
01:04:52,454 --> 01:04:53,454
Come.

1086
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:54,654
They have opened the door!

1087
01:04:55,214 --> 01:04:57,294
Here comes the Advocate & that girl.

1088
01:04:57,534 --> 01:04:58,934
Come down, Advocate.
Let's go.

1089
01:05:09,494 --> 01:05:10,894
Don't ask me anything.

1090
01:05:13,854 --> 01:05:17,934
My Advocate has told me not to
say anything further to you.

1091
01:05:19,974 --> 01:05:23,654
Everything that happens hereafter,
I can do it only upon his advice.

1092
01:05:24,294 --> 01:05:25,294
Move!

1093
01:05:34,414 --> 01:05:37,934
D...Didn't I...I... I... Te...
Explain!

1094
01:05:38,254 --> 01:05:41,574
Babuettan asked you to vacate this place.
You didn't listen.

1095
01:05:41,614 --> 01:05:44,014
The media and police have never
entered this place till date.

1096
01:05:46,614 --> 01:05:51,214
If you leave from here without a
f...fracture, it won't be right.

1097
01:06:27,174 --> 01:06:30,494
Catch him!
- C...C...C... Catch him!

1098
01:06:32,974 --> 01:06:34,334
Babuetta, your nose!

1099
01:06:36,774 --> 01:06:38,334
Catch him!

1100
01:06:42,974 --> 01:06:44,414
Don't let him go!

1101
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:48,334
Catch him!

1102
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,534
Catch him!

1103
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:52,214
Advocate, get in through the back door.

1104
01:06:52,214 --> 01:06:53,854
Catch him.
- Get in, fast.

1105
01:06:54,654 --> 01:06:56,334
Block the vehicle.

1106
01:06:57,854 --> 01:06:59,574
Stop! Stop there!

1107
01:06:59,614 --> 01:07:01,614
Get lost, you scoundrels!
- Stop!

1108
01:07:10,054 --> 01:07:12,014
Anzar!
- What is it, Advocate?

1109
01:07:12,126 --> 01:07:13,926
W...What is she doing here?

1110
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:15,921
This is our Anuradha Chechi, right?

1111
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,480
Chechi said that she's
coming with us.

1112
01:07:17,505 --> 01:07:18,585
Have you told everyone at home?

1113
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,490
Or else, when we reach there,
they would create a scene.

1114
01:07:20,515 --> 01:07:21,635
T...To my house?

1115
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,260
Yes. To your house.

1116
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:25,534
If you drop me anywhere else,
I'll create a scene.

1117
01:07:25,974 --> 01:07:27,854
Now it's your responsibility
to protect me.

1118
01:07:27,854 --> 01:07:32,974
And, whoever gave you money to send
a false legal notice in my name...

1119
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,974
Wait and watch,
until you reveal that in press conference,

1120
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:37,334
I won't leave you.

1121
01:07:38,294 --> 01:07:39,694
You're too good!

1122
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:40,734
I like you!

1123
01:07:40,734 --> 01:07:42,294
So straight to Advocate's house.

1124
01:07:42,534 --> 01:07:43,534
'Ghar Wapsi'.

1125
01:07:49,294 --> 01:07:52,254
My advocate has told me not
to talk to you people.

1126
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:54,174
My foot!

1127
01:07:55,294 --> 01:07:57,534
So both of them fooled
us very cleverly, right?

1128
01:07:57,694 --> 01:07:59,494
This is some huge game plan, Madam.

1129
01:07:59,614 --> 01:08:01,814
Hey! Do we have our
presence in that colony?

1130
01:08:02,174 --> 01:08:04,974
We can't enter that area, sir.
There will be huge riots.

1131
01:08:06,414 --> 01:08:07,414
Shit.

1132
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:09,214
Stop there.

1133
01:08:09,254 --> 01:08:10,654
Where are you barging into?

1134
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:12,854
You know right?
 I have a daughter as well.

1135
01:08:12,974 --> 01:08:16,694
All this while, I have only praised
you and spoken ill of her.

1136
01:08:16,894 --> 01:08:19,774
But in this matter,
I'm with her and her husband.

1137
01:08:20,294 --> 01:08:23,334
Because of your recklessness,
he's almost about to lose his job.

1138
01:08:24,294 --> 01:08:26,494
You're saying this without
understanding the situation.

1139
01:08:27,254 --> 01:08:30,494
In fact, it was him who
handed over this case to me.

1140
01:08:31,094 --> 01:08:33,894
He said this as well.
That you'll put the blame on him.

1141
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:36,414
My scoundrel brother in law!

1142
01:08:36,414 --> 01:08:38,174
What's the relation
between you and her?

1143
01:08:38,334 --> 01:08:40,534
Coming here after filing a
false case against the DGP?

1144
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:43,094
That's not her, mom!

1145
01:08:43,294 --> 01:08:44,294
Then who is it?

1146
01:08:45,374 --> 01:08:47,334
That's a s...story!

1147
01:08:47,974 --> 01:08:50,694
Stories have started filing cases now?

1148
01:08:50,734 --> 01:08:51,814
You're mocking me?

1149
01:08:51,854 --> 01:08:53,174
Aren't you the one mocking us?

1150
01:08:53,414 --> 01:08:55,974
If there's something going
on between you both,

1151
01:08:55,974 --> 01:08:58,054
end it right here,
right now.

1152
01:08:58,294 --> 01:09:00,574
Or else, get out of here, right now.

1153
01:09:00,814 --> 01:09:04,254
Mom, this is not a TV serial, right?

1154
01:09:04,254 --> 01:09:05,774
Let's go inside and talk.

1155
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:06,854
You go inside.

1156
01:09:07,174 --> 01:09:08,334
You go outside.
Get out.

1157
01:09:08,694 --> 01:09:09,694
What if I won't?

1158
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:14,374
I will come inside.

1159
01:09:14,574 --> 01:09:17,534
If you send me out,
I'll put your son behind bars.

1160
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:19,094
I'll get your son in law
fired from his job.

1161
01:09:19,094 --> 01:09:20,254
You!!
- You!!!

1162
01:09:20,894 --> 01:09:21,894
Don't call me that.

1163
01:09:21,894 --> 01:09:23,814
Anuradha.
That's my name.

1164
01:09:24,814 --> 01:09:25,814
Where are you off to?

1165
01:09:25,814 --> 01:09:26,814
Inside.

1166
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:27,934
Vishalam!

1167
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:29,694
You go inside, Vishalam!

1168
01:09:29,694 --> 01:09:31,494
You don't know what..
- Shut up!

1169
01:09:31,974 --> 01:09:33,374
I asked you to go inside.

1170
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:35,334
This is my house!

1171
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:37,854
By working so hard,
taking so much effort,

1172
01:09:37,894 --> 01:09:39,334
and forging fake documents,

1173
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:41,854
I acquired this land &
building in my own name.

1174
01:09:42,294 --> 01:09:45,494
I will decide who should go inside,
and who should go out from here.

1175
01:09:45,534 --> 01:09:46,534
Understood?

1176
01:09:47,214 --> 01:09:48,574
You go inside, girl.

1177
01:09:51,934 --> 01:09:56,254
Only if you can give her clothes to change,
and food to eat, you can also go inside.

1178
01:09:56,254 --> 01:09:57,814
Or else?
- Get out!

1179
01:09:59,014 --> 01:10:01,574
I was waiting for a
reason to get rid of her.

1180
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:04,214
Hey! Send her a notice immediately,
demanding divorce.

1181
01:10:04,214 --> 01:10:06,414
What the hell have you smoked up?

1182
01:10:06,414 --> 01:10:07,854
First class Idukki Gold (Marijuana)!

1183
01:10:08,654 --> 01:10:10,934
Mom, please go inside.

1184
01:10:12,614 --> 01:10:15,694
What's waiting inside now?
- Who's that parasite in our premises?

1185
01:10:16,974 --> 01:10:17,974
Hey!

1186
01:10:18,174 --> 01:10:19,174
Come here.

1187
01:10:19,294 --> 01:10:20,294
Me?
 - Yes, you!

1188
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:21,334
Come here.

1189
01:10:23,614 --> 01:10:24,614
Who are you?

1190
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,614
I am Advocate's buddy.
- Which Advocate's?

1191
01:10:27,174 --> 01:10:28,774
Mine!
- Oh! His?

1192
01:10:29,734 --> 01:10:32,814
You're impressive!
Earrings, chain, long hair...

1193
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:33,854
Nice.

1194
01:10:33,934 --> 01:10:35,374
Come here. Let me ask you.
- This is also there.

1195
01:10:36,974 --> 01:10:38,454
Do you have stuff?
- What?

1196
01:10:38,654 --> 01:10:39,854
To smoke up?
Idukki Gold!

1197
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,574
No.
- You don't have that?

1198
01:10:42,774 --> 01:10:44,534
Do you booze?
 - No. - No drinking too?

1199
01:10:44,534 --> 01:10:46,094
Sheesh!

1200
01:10:46,414 --> 01:10:49,694
Out to tempt people in this attire!

1201
01:10:50,174 --> 01:10:51,174
Buddy, it seems.

1202
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,374
I had kept a cane here.

1203
01:10:53,414 --> 01:10:55,454
Shall I leave then, Advocate?

1204
01:10:57,334 --> 01:10:58,334
Don't break it.

1205
01:10:59,854 --> 01:11:01,854
Get going!
- Nothing happened.

1206
01:11:01,854 --> 01:11:02,854
Who is this guy?

1207
01:11:15,574 --> 01:11:17,414
'Youth on fire'

1208
01:11:35,614 --> 01:11:36,614
Blanket for you.

1209
01:11:38,374 --> 01:11:39,374
That's him.

1210
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:42,334
Can't believe it, right?

1211
01:11:43,614 --> 01:11:46,854
He was a firebrand orator
while studying in college.

1212
01:11:47,654 --> 01:11:48,654
He was really smart.

1213
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:52,374
A lot happened after that.

1214
01:11:54,094 --> 01:11:56,294
Gradually, he started becoming a failure.

1215
01:11:58,574 --> 01:11:59,974
A colossal failure.

1216
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,734
He couldn't rise up
to my expectations.

1217
01:12:19,854 --> 01:12:22,574
She's not the kind who
would leave so easily.

1218
01:12:22,734 --> 01:12:26,094
And both of them have good
support from some people here.

1219
01:12:27,894 --> 01:12:29,654
So they have your
blessings too, dad?

1220
01:12:29,974 --> 01:12:31,454
Yes, they do.

1221
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:32,814
What's wrong with that?

1222
01:12:33,334 --> 01:12:36,694
You're the reason behind all the
troubles that have happened here.

1223
01:12:37,054 --> 01:12:39,494
There's nothing wrong
in doing fraud jobs.

1224
01:12:39,534 --> 01:12:41,814
But that needs to have some
dignity and sincerity.

1225
01:12:42,214 --> 01:12:43,654
I always keep that.

1226
01:12:44,414 --> 01:12:48,974
Dad, the police & media know that
he has brought that girl here.

1227
01:12:48,974 --> 01:12:50,734
ADGP called me directly.

1228
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:51,854
Isn't that a good thing?

1229
01:12:52,894 --> 01:12:54,214
You should stay in your
senses if you smoke up.

1230
01:12:54,574 --> 01:12:59,054
They see this case as a conspiracy
between him and that girl.

1231
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:00,614
They are really furious at me.

1232
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:03,014
I might end up in
trouble any moment.

1233
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:04,694
Say that you will lose your job.

1234
01:13:04,694 --> 01:13:06,374
Let him lose his j.. job!

1235
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:08,854
Into this m...
- Don't say that.

1236
01:13:08,894 --> 01:13:11,854
He's the one who got
me into this mess!

1237
01:13:12,414 --> 01:13:15,894
To stop me from saying the truth
to the police, he fell at my...

1238
01:13:15,894 --> 01:13:16,894
I fell at your feet.

1239
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,734
I can fall at your feet again.

1240
01:13:18,734 --> 01:13:20,854
Can you please send that
girl away from here?

1241
01:13:20,894 --> 01:13:22,774
Or else, I'll lose my job.

1242
01:13:22,934 --> 01:13:23,934
Your job....

1243
01:13:24,374 --> 01:13:25,694
Forget it.
- Hey you!

1244
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,734
Hey you!

1245
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:28,854
Don't call her that.
Anuradha. That's her name.

1246
01:13:28,894 --> 01:13:30,654
Bro, you mo...
- No!

1247
01:13:30,694 --> 01:13:32,014
Because of you...
- That's okay.

1248
01:13:32,494 --> 01:13:34,094
... this girl got
stranded on the streets.

1249
01:13:34,454 --> 01:13:37,974
Her stepmom is not letting
her into her house now.

1250
01:13:38,694 --> 01:13:42,654
When a random girl came and
said a false story to you,

1251
01:13:42,894 --> 01:13:44,654
you became greedy,

1252
01:13:44,934 --> 01:13:47,734
and did all this nonsense,
and we're suffering for that.

1253
01:13:47,854 --> 01:13:48,854
You also suffer now.

1254
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:51,934
This house belongs to me as well.

1255
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,334
It's not a place for you to
bring whomever you want to.

1256
01:13:55,494 --> 01:14:00,574
Before something happens to my husband's
job, you better leave with her.

1257
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:02,934
Or else, I'll hang myself
at the attic here.

1258
01:14:02,974 --> 01:14:04,254
But there's no attic here.

1259
01:14:05,214 --> 01:14:06,214
Dear...

1260
01:14:06,254 --> 01:14:07,254
What is it, dad?

1261
01:14:07,254 --> 01:14:08,614
Don't do anything foolish.

1262
01:14:09,014 --> 01:14:11,534
There's some awesome
pesticide at our store room.

1263
01:14:11,574 --> 01:14:13,534
Have it.
Just 15 minutes!

1264
01:14:13,614 --> 01:14:15,854
Even God can't save you after that.

1265
01:14:16,534 --> 01:14:18,534
You smoked up Idukki Gold
in the morning itself?

1266
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:19,534
No!

1267
01:14:19,734 --> 01:14:20,734
This is Hashish.

1268
01:14:20,974 --> 01:14:22,974
Brigit gave it to me.
My new girlfriend.

1269
01:14:23,774 --> 01:14:24,774
Is she dead?

1270
01:14:26,574 --> 01:14:27,574
Hey!

1271
01:14:27,574 --> 01:14:29,214
What I did was wrong.

1272
01:14:29,774 --> 01:14:32,334
To her and my p...profession.

1273
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:37,974
Quoting the amount you spent
to get dad out of the case,

1274
01:14:38,214 --> 01:14:39,814
when you blackmailed me,

1275
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:43,214
I had to forget the ethics
that my senior taught me.

1276
01:14:44,254 --> 01:14:48,574
When the police asked if it was
her who made me send the notice,

1277
01:14:48,974 --> 01:14:50,614
I nodded yes.

1278
01:14:50,614 --> 01:14:52,414
That's because I
remembered your face.

1279
01:14:52,414 --> 01:14:53,414
This face?

1280
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:55,054
What you said is right.

1281
01:14:55,414 --> 01:14:57,414
This house belongs to you as well.

1282
01:14:58,254 --> 01:15:02,094
I take up the responsibility
of her situation now.

1283
01:15:06,894 --> 01:15:12,054
Whoever made a fool out of me
using you as a pawn,

1284
01:15:12,534 --> 01:15:14,414
I won't spare him.

1285
01:15:15,294 --> 01:15:17,614
I am taking this case up.

1286
01:15:18,454 --> 01:15:21,214
Before the police investigates
and reaches a conclusion,

1287
01:15:21,254 --> 01:15:23,494
the conspiracy and mystery behind this,

1288
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,254
whatever it maybe,

1289
01:15:25,374 --> 01:15:26,934
I will find it out.

1290
01:15:29,294 --> 01:15:30,294
It has risen up.

1291
01:15:30,294 --> 01:15:31,294
Look!

1292
01:15:33,214 --> 01:15:34,214
Shall we leave?

1293
01:15:38,174 --> 01:15:39,174
Son...

1294
01:15:40,414 --> 01:15:41,774
You're a real hero!

1295
01:15:42,654 --> 01:15:44,694
Now you just have to be yourself.

1296
01:15:45,214 --> 01:15:46,414
Your old self.

1297
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:48,214
All the best!

1298
01:15:52,934 --> 01:15:55,454
I said all that for a punch,
and I'm leaving now.

1299
01:15:56,094 --> 01:15:57,854
I don't know what will happen.

1300
01:15:59,094 --> 01:16:01,934
You should do me a f...favour, dad.
- What is it?

1301
01:16:03,414 --> 01:16:09,094
When you get high on weed, don't write
our property off to these frauds.

1302
01:16:10,054 --> 01:16:12,414
It's because I don't have
anywhere else to go to.

1303
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:15,574
I'm not sure.

1304
01:16:16,574 --> 01:16:17,574
Sometimes if I...

1305
01:16:19,094 --> 01:16:20,334
if I'm tripping on it,

1306
01:16:20,734 --> 01:16:23,814
if someone brings a stamp paper,
I might sign on it.

1307
01:16:24,934 --> 01:16:26,854
Still, I'll try my level best.

1308
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:28,574
You go without fear.

1309
01:16:28,894 --> 01:16:30,534
Or else, we'll sleep
at the cow shed!

1310
01:16:41,414 --> 01:16:42,414
What a great father!

1311
01:16:54,534 --> 01:16:55,694
Is that your dad's number?

1312
01:16:56,334 --> 01:16:57,334
Yes.

1313
01:16:57,334 --> 01:16:58,334
How do you know that?

1314
01:17:00,214 --> 01:17:03,294
The girl who came to me
posing as you, gave it to me.

1315
01:17:04,894 --> 01:17:06,694
In case,

1316
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:09,414
if I try to contact her,

1317
01:17:09,814 --> 01:17:12,694
she knew that number
would be switched off.

1318
01:17:15,294 --> 01:17:18,334
Your dad was m...murdered by someone.

1319
01:17:22,414 --> 01:17:26,334
Behind trapping the DGP in a
molestation case using your identity,

1320
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:30,854
there is something beyond
what we can guess.

1321
01:17:31,054 --> 01:17:32,214
There is someone.

1322
01:17:32,894 --> 01:17:34,494
What do we do now?

1323
01:17:36,254 --> 01:17:41,334
The Assistant Commissioner here
is a c...close friend of mine.

1324
01:17:41,814 --> 01:17:43,614
Let's go and meet him.

1325
01:17:43,734 --> 01:17:45,254
And we'll give our statements too.

1326
01:17:46,574 --> 01:17:47,574
We can do that.

1327
01:17:47,854 --> 01:17:50,894
I want to know who is
behind my father's death.

1328
01:17:52,494 --> 01:17:54,454
But, why did they do this to my dad?

1329
01:17:56,454 --> 01:18:00,054
Hey! Someone is following us.

1330
01:18:00,094 --> 01:18:01,814
Anzar, go fast!

1331
01:18:02,294 --> 01:18:03,294
I'll go!

1332
01:18:03,494 --> 01:18:05,934
But I'm sure of one thing.
- What? - They won't let us go!

1333
01:18:06,494 --> 01:18:07,694
Go fast!

1334
01:18:12,214 --> 01:18:13,854
Is this the time to kiss me, Advocate?

1335
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:02,054
A... A... Advocate!

1336
01:19:02,254 --> 01:19:03,654
W... Where are you off to?

1337
01:19:04,534 --> 01:19:09,374
I... I have brought s... someone
who wants to m.. meet you.

1338
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:50,094
Don't be scared.
I'm right behind you.

1339
01:19:50,814 --> 01:19:52,454
C... Come in front of me.

1340
01:19:52,574 --> 01:19:55,254
Aren't you the g... goon?
- I'm on leave today.

1341
01:19:56,454 --> 01:19:57,534
Go on!

1342
01:20:10,934 --> 01:20:11,934
Balu!

1343
01:20:15,694 --> 01:20:16,694
Leave me.

1344
01:20:16,734 --> 01:20:17,734
Leave me!

1345
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:24,614
Balu!

1346
01:20:25,494 --> 01:20:26,614
Come on!

1347
01:20:27,374 --> 01:20:28,374
Leave me!

1348
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:33,774
Balu!

1349
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,534
Advocate!

1350
01:23:26,654 --> 01:23:29,894
So you were ready for a battle, huh?

1351
01:23:31,294 --> 01:23:35,654
Not one...
I am ready for many battles!

1352
01:24:06,234 --> 01:24:07,234
Hey!

1353
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:09,954
Hasn't Babuettan told you not to
be seen in this area anymore?

1354
01:24:33,554 --> 01:24:36,354
CM asked me to join today,
canceling my leave.

1355
01:24:36,954 --> 01:24:37,994
So...

1356
01:24:38,434 --> 01:24:40,954
Anuradha & her Advocate gave
their statements? - Yes, Sir.

1357
01:24:41,354 --> 01:24:43,154
They gave their statements to AC Vincent.

1358
01:24:46,234 --> 01:24:48,114
This Advocate's brother in
law is a Sub Inspector.

1359
01:24:48,154 --> 01:24:49,314
One Mr. Mohanan Pillai.

1360
01:24:49,594 --> 01:24:50,714
He is corrupt, Sir.

1361
01:24:51,274 --> 01:24:52,794
He's a nuisance
element in our force.

1362
01:24:53,434 --> 01:24:58,074
Some girl approached him with the
complaint, using Anuradha's identity.

1363
01:24:58,514 --> 01:25:01,274
In fact, even the idea of a legal
notice was given to Mohanan Pillai,

1364
01:25:01,314 --> 01:25:04,354
by that girl who did
the impersonation.

1365
01:25:05,154 --> 01:25:07,954
To score brownie points,
he claimed that it was his own idea.

1366
01:25:08,274 --> 01:25:10,594
Sir, you needn't write
an FIR or investigate...

1367
01:25:10,874 --> 01:25:11,874
Then?

1368
01:25:11,914 --> 01:25:14,514
In such situations,
there is a section in law, right?

1369
01:25:15,394 --> 01:25:16,954
Let's send a legal notice to him,

1370
01:25:17,274 --> 01:25:18,874
asking a compensation
of 1 Crore Rupees.

1371
01:25:20,314 --> 01:25:21,434
One Crore?

1372
01:25:22,994 --> 01:25:26,274
We don't have any idea so far about who
that girl was, and why she did this, right?

1373
01:25:27,954 --> 01:25:31,074
After such a conspiracy happened
against the Police Chief of the State,

1374
01:25:31,434 --> 01:25:32,594
have you found even a name,

1375
01:25:33,714 --> 01:25:35,994
or a solid point to put forward?

1376
01:25:36,794 --> 01:25:39,474
Without all that, you are all
still groping in the dark, right?

1377
01:25:47,194 --> 01:25:50,874
When a girl came with a complaint,
you didn't enquire about her identity,

1378
01:25:50,914 --> 01:25:52,434
and jumped right in,
for the money!

1379
01:25:53,994 --> 01:25:57,354
If you had filed an FIR & investigated it,
I wouldn't have faced this humiliation.

1380
01:25:58,354 --> 01:26:00,594
You are suspended from the
service with immediate effect.

1381
01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:03,354
Don't suspend me, Sir.

1382
01:26:03,554 --> 01:26:04,594
Then?

1383
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:06,794
You could leave me with a warning...

1384
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:08,154
Get the hell out of here.

1385
01:26:09,714 --> 01:26:10,874
Take this @$@% away....

1386
01:26:16,314 --> 01:26:17,994
What all are you doing?

1387
01:26:18,554 --> 01:26:20,874
My stammerer brother in law
is your close friend, right?

1388
01:26:21,354 --> 01:26:25,234
He left the house challenging that he
will investigate this case himself.

1389
01:26:25,954 --> 01:26:28,234
I will be after him from
today onwards, Sir.

1390
01:26:28,674 --> 01:26:30,154
If he finds something,

1391
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:32,834
I'll inform that to
the DG before him.

1392
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:37,394
My journey from suspension to
promotion, begins here, Sir.

1393
01:26:37,554 --> 01:26:39,114
Whatever needs to happen,
will happen.

1394
01:26:39,274 --> 01:26:40,954
And receive everything
that comes your way!

1395
01:26:41,274 --> 01:26:42,594
So you get going, Pillai.

1396
01:26:45,154 --> 01:26:46,354
All of you wait outside.

1397
01:26:48,154 --> 01:26:49,274
Indulekha, you stay back.

1398
01:26:51,754 --> 01:26:54,994
Indu, I am thoroughly disappointed
with the way you handled this case.

1399
01:26:56,794 --> 01:26:58,514
That Advocate & the girl
gave their statements...

1400
01:26:58,554 --> 01:27:00,874
I have rejoined...
Now the enquiry will cool down.

1401
01:27:03,394 --> 01:27:05,314
But what if they change
their statements again?

1402
01:27:06,314 --> 01:27:07,954
I would have to go on
leave then also?

1403
01:27:08,114 --> 01:27:09,434
Don't think like that, Sir.

1404
01:27:09,554 --> 01:27:10,914
Your alibi is solid.

1405
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:13,954
What that Advocate & girl are
saying, is not so credible.

1406
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,594
Their bonafides are suspect.

1407
01:27:15,914 --> 01:27:17,594
With suspect bonafides,

1408
01:27:18,034 --> 01:27:20,834
those two are getting off
this case Scot-free.

1409
01:27:21,714 --> 01:27:23,114
Let me ask you something.

1410
01:27:23,554 --> 01:27:27,194
Have you acted bonafide in this
investigation, as a police officer?

1411
01:27:27,394 --> 01:27:29,554
That's an accusation, Sir.
 - Yes.

1412
01:27:30,394 --> 01:27:32,154
On rock solid grounds!

1413
01:27:33,154 --> 01:27:35,754
The first woman to become
the State's Police Chief.

1414
01:27:36,594 --> 01:27:37,954
Sounds tempting, right?

1415
01:27:42,074 --> 01:27:44,314
There's no point in us continuing
this conversation, Sir.

1416
01:27:44,554 --> 01:27:46,754
I'm handling the investigation
of this case even now.

1417
01:27:46,954 --> 01:27:48,034
CM trusts me.

1418
01:27:48,554 --> 01:27:50,234
I know how to take this forward.

1419
01:27:50,954 --> 01:27:51,994
With your permission!

1420
01:28:07,394 --> 01:28:09,074
A... Aren't you sleeping?

1421
01:28:10,874 --> 01:28:11,914
Listen...

1422
01:28:12,274 --> 01:28:15,074
Before the accident happened,

1423
01:28:15,114 --> 01:28:16,794
didn't your dad go to Trivandrum,

1424
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:18,274
to meet someone?

1425
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:19,794
Yes.

1426
01:28:20,434 --> 01:28:22,154
He told me that he was going for my sake.

1427
01:28:22,594 --> 01:28:24,474
But he didn't say what
he was going there for.

1428
01:28:25,594 --> 01:28:28,274
Your entire family is
like that of a TV Serial.

1429
01:28:28,314 --> 01:28:29,954
A t...torturing stepmother.

1430
01:28:29,954 --> 01:28:31,714
A younger brother who
shows no affection.

1431
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:34,194
A f...father who
suffocates you with love.

1432
01:28:34,794 --> 01:28:36,834
I... It's a marathon of cliches.

1433
01:28:37,314 --> 01:28:39,834
A father who is stoned out
of his head all the time,

1434
01:28:40,234 --> 01:28:44,074
a sister who supports her husband's
emotional blackmailing of her own brother,

1435
01:28:45,034 --> 01:28:48,754
and a mother who curses her
own son all the time.

1436
01:28:49,554 --> 01:28:51,354
These are all very
rare in this world.

1437
01:28:51,594 --> 01:28:53,794
Only you have that good fortune.

1438
01:28:55,754 --> 01:28:57,234
G... Go to bed.

1439
01:28:58,154 --> 01:29:01,314
We need to meet your
stepmom tomorrow morning.

1440
01:29:01,354 --> 01:29:02,354
For what?

1441
01:29:02,394 --> 01:29:04,074
I'm starting the i..investigation, right?

1442
01:29:04,434 --> 01:29:09,514
Anzar and you,
together make up my Dr. Watson.

1443
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:12,074
I...I'm scared thinking about that.

1444
01:29:13,594 --> 01:29:16,274
As if this Sherlock is awesome!

1445
01:29:16,314 --> 01:29:19,274
You take hours to ask a
question with your stammering.

1446
01:29:20,554 --> 01:29:23,794
Most probably, you'll just end up walking
with your hands folded at the back.

1447
01:29:24,594 --> 01:29:28,474
Well, it doesn't feel like
your stammering is constant.

1448
01:29:30,074 --> 01:29:31,434
Only when I t...talk.

1449
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:35,114
That's a joke that a great
man said long back.

1450
01:29:35,274 --> 01:29:38,074
My dad used to say that
people would wait endlessly

1451
01:29:38,114 --> 01:29:41,394
to listen to speeches by
the man who said that.

1452
01:29:42,434 --> 01:29:44,674
C... Comrade EMS, right?

1453
01:29:44,714 --> 01:29:45,754
Yes.

1454
01:29:46,474 --> 01:29:48,274
He was such a great leader, right?

1455
01:29:49,314 --> 01:29:52,994
If you take an effort, you can also
become a decent Advocate, right?

1456
01:29:53,274 --> 01:29:55,594
Oh! Through that g...gap,

1457
01:29:55,754 --> 01:29:58,474
I...Inspiration and motivation, huh?

1458
01:29:58,914 --> 01:30:00,754
I...It's pointless.

1459
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:05,234
All the speech therapists
whom I have met till date,

1460
01:30:05,314 --> 01:30:07,994
use this as their first punch line.

1461
01:30:08,994 --> 01:30:11,754
It has never w..worked in my case.

1462
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:15,874
Like my dad told you...

1463
01:30:16,154 --> 01:30:18,154
I'm a failure.

1464
01:30:19,114 --> 01:30:21,994
Every time I try to fail better.

1465
01:30:29,354 --> 01:30:30,354
You...

1466
01:30:30,714 --> 01:30:31,874
Aren't you that lawyer?

1467
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:33,314
Her lawyer?

1468
01:30:33,994 --> 01:30:35,154
I saw you on TV.

1469
01:30:38,474 --> 01:30:40,834
Who asked you to come
here with these guys?

1470
01:30:40,834 --> 01:30:44,514
You are walking around all decked up with
them, after getting your own dad killed?

1471
01:30:44,954 --> 01:30:47,194
Don't talk nonsense!
 - Oh! You can do all that, huh?

1472
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:48,394
No problem in that, huh?

1473
01:30:48,474 --> 01:30:51,554
Claiming that big shots molested you,
you humiliate them,

1474
01:30:51,714 --> 01:30:54,274
and make money out of that
with this lawyer, right? - Sheesh!

1475
01:30:54,514 --> 01:30:57,434
Advocate, she seems to be really trashy.
Shall we scoot?

1476
01:30:58,474 --> 01:30:59,474
What?

1477
01:31:01,434 --> 01:31:05,434
[Sings the song 'Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai']

1478
01:31:07,994 --> 01:31:10,074
We know that you're trashy.
Don't show off too much.

1479
01:31:10,074 --> 01:31:11,114
That's what you meant, right?
- Get lost, you dog!

1480
01:31:11,234 --> 01:31:13,314
How dare you talk nonsense
to me, coming to my house?

1481
01:31:13,394 --> 01:31:15,554
Don't make so much noise, Chechi.
 - That's what you were trying to say?

1482
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:17,554
How did I become your Chechi?

1483
01:31:19,554 --> 01:31:21,994
A...A...
- Aunty? Aunty it is, then.

1484
01:31:22,594 --> 01:31:24,434
Get lost from here with these two.

1485
01:31:24,514 --> 01:31:26,794
I didn't come here to argue with you,

1486
01:31:26,834 --> 01:31:28,674
or to claim my rights.

1487
01:31:28,794 --> 01:31:30,594
There are some things in this house,
which my dad bought for me.

1488
01:31:30,714 --> 01:31:32,194
I can pack it in a small bag.

1489
01:31:32,234 --> 01:31:33,594
I'll leave after taking that.

1490
01:31:34,154 --> 01:31:37,714
Who wants your certificate, clothes & chain
of 1.5 sovereigns? Take it & get lost!

1491
01:31:39,714 --> 01:31:42,154
Who came to meet you yesterday?

1492
01:31:42,674 --> 01:31:45,394
Did they say that they
would give you money?

1493
01:31:46,354 --> 01:31:47,434
No one came here.

1494
01:31:47,994 --> 01:31:51,954
As if I'll readily accept it,
if some random people offer cash to me!

1495
01:31:52,074 --> 01:31:53,554
Oh! So you take money!

1496
01:31:54,114 --> 01:31:56,354
Didn't I tell you that
Chechi takes cash?

1497
01:31:56,394 --> 01:31:57,514
Give her cash and then ask!

1498
01:31:57,714 --> 01:31:59,114
Go and ask that to your mom!

1499
01:31:59,154 --> 01:32:01,474
Sorry! My mom left this earth
as soon as she saw my face.

1500
01:32:01,594 --> 01:32:03,514
So I have no mom.
Only my own words!

1501
01:32:03,514 --> 01:32:05,114
That can be seen from your face.

1502
01:32:06,114 --> 01:32:07,154
Took everything, right?

1503
01:32:07,194 --> 01:32:08,554
Don't ever come back here.

1504
01:32:08,714 --> 01:32:09,754
Let's go, Advocate.

1505
01:32:10,034 --> 01:32:11,074
Your Father?

1506
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,034
Yeah.
 - Excuse me.

1507
01:32:16,914 --> 01:32:17,954
Such a great man!

1508
01:32:18,674 --> 01:32:19,874
Lucky that he died soon.

1509
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:21,714
Such a horrible lady.
Moron!

1510
01:32:21,874 --> 01:32:23,914
Get lost, you schmuck!
 - You get lost! Bye, child.

1511
01:32:25,954 --> 01:32:27,434
What are you looking at?
Come here.

1512
01:32:29,274 --> 01:32:31,434
Hey! Why did you bring me here?

1513
01:32:31,994 --> 01:32:33,194
Investigation, it seems.

1514
01:32:33,474 --> 01:32:35,794
Did you even open your mouth
and talk to her properly?

1515
01:32:36,194 --> 01:32:38,554
Did you get any useful
information from there?

1516
01:32:39,154 --> 01:32:40,714
Went in and came out in a flash!

1517
01:32:40,754 --> 01:32:41,954
I shouldn't have come for this.

1518
01:32:41,994 --> 01:32:43,794
Didn't work out. It's okay.
 - Hey!

1519
01:32:44,954 --> 01:32:47,394
I got whatever information I needed.

1520
01:32:48,074 --> 01:32:52,154
Ever since we reached here,
that woman was really tensed.

1521
01:32:52,474 --> 01:32:53,954
N... N...
- Nachos?

1522
01:32:55,154 --> 01:32:58,434
N... Nervous like anything,
she was over acting there.

1523
01:32:58,954 --> 01:33:02,074
She had sweat on her
forehead and neck.

1524
01:33:02,954 --> 01:33:06,554
Out of tension, she was
clenching her right fist tight.

1525
01:33:07,194 --> 01:33:13,034
I was sure that the people behind this
game, would have contacted her yesterday.

1526
01:33:13,914 --> 01:33:17,714
They would have offered money to her,
not to allow you into the house.

1527
01:33:18,834 --> 01:33:21,874
At the colony, before hitting me,

1528
01:33:21,954 --> 01:33:25,394
someone was giving instructions
to 'Iron' Babu through the phone.

1529
01:33:26,474 --> 01:33:30,114
Outside the c...colony,
there was a black c...car.

1530
01:33:30,354 --> 01:33:32,754
They would have come
to meet this woman.

1531
01:33:33,354 --> 01:33:35,874
When I asked her if
someone came to meet her,

1532
01:33:35,914 --> 01:33:37,194
she got shocked.

1533
01:33:37,874 --> 01:33:40,594
Her reply was a lie.

1534
01:33:42,234 --> 01:33:43,954
How do you know that so precisely?

1535
01:33:45,314 --> 01:33:47,554
Google it on your phone.
NLP.

1536
01:33:47,714 --> 01:33:49,114
NLP?
What's that?

1537
01:33:49,314 --> 01:33:52,034
N... Neuro Linguistic Programming.

1538
01:33:52,354 --> 01:33:55,314
Sounds like fake names of
diseases said in the movies.

1539
01:33:55,594 --> 01:33:57,594
When someone is saying the truth,

1540
01:33:57,954 --> 01:34:01,034
or when he or she is saying
something from memory,

1541
01:34:01,194 --> 01:34:04,194
his or her eyeball would
move to the left.

1542
01:34:04,314 --> 01:34:07,994
If someone who's not so intelligent,
or an expert con artist,

1543
01:34:08,034 --> 01:34:09,114
is lying,

1544
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:12,194
the eyeball would move
to the top right side.

1545
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:14,594
That woman was lying.

1546
01:34:15,394 --> 01:34:16,514
No one came here.

1547
01:34:17,394 --> 01:34:20,554
Whatever I guessed is right.
I'm on the right track.

1548
01:34:21,874 --> 01:34:24,554
Advocate!
Awesome! Mass!

1549
01:34:24,994 --> 01:34:26,754
You shouldn't get back to
the vehicle like this now.

1550
01:34:26,754 --> 01:34:27,754
Then?

1551
01:34:27,794 --> 01:34:29,194
In slow motion!

1552
01:34:50,994 --> 01:34:56,234
The Police is saying that there
are no surveillance cameras here.

1553
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:57,394
What a pity!

1554
01:34:57,954 --> 01:35:00,834
Anyway, we should search
this s... spot thoroughly.

1555
01:35:00,914 --> 01:35:01,994
Search the photo?

1556
01:35:02,154 --> 01:35:03,554
Spot!
 - Oh! Okay.

1557
01:35:04,394 --> 01:35:05,994
Why don't we try
putting a dummy, Boss?

1558
01:35:06,674 --> 01:35:10,114
Cli.. Cli...
- You mean Cla Cla Clu Clu Cli Cli (Rhyme)?

1559
01:35:10,114 --> 01:35:11,554
Don't come up with cliches.

1560
01:35:11,554 --> 01:35:13,994
Don't use such words in
such situations, please.

1561
01:35:14,354 --> 01:35:16,874
T...T... T...
- You want to go to the toilet?

1562
01:35:17,034 --> 01:35:18,154
Terrible!

1563
01:35:20,594 --> 01:35:21,754
Wow! Honey candy!

1564
01:35:48,114 --> 01:35:50,074
It rained heavily that night, Sir.

1565
01:35:50,314 --> 01:35:51,754
All the shops closed early.

1566
01:35:51,994 --> 01:35:53,594
No one has seen this accident.

1567
01:35:53,834 --> 01:35:56,834
Police came here many
times and asked everyone.

1568
01:35:57,234 --> 01:35:59,714
Go... Go...
- Where can I go, Sir?

1569
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,554
I've been here for the past 20 years.

1570
01:36:01,594 --> 01:36:03,554
I arranged the documents
with a lot of difficulty.

1571
01:36:03,594 --> 01:36:06,994
My dear Chetta, he's not asking you to go.
Rest will come now. Wait.

1572
01:36:07,034 --> 01:36:12,194
Go... Got to tell you, us insurance agents'
enquiry is not like a police enquiry.

1573
01:36:13,874 --> 01:36:16,754
Those who give us information,
will have benefits.

1574
01:36:16,754 --> 01:36:21,234
Also, we won't let out the name or
any other details of the informant.

1575
01:36:21,354 --> 01:36:23,234
So you're from an insurance agency?

1576
01:36:23,514 --> 01:36:26,114
This idiot believed that we're
from an insurance agency.

1577
01:36:26,234 --> 01:36:28,034
So aren't you from the
insurance agency?

1578
01:36:28,514 --> 01:36:30,834
Yes. Can you please
take a new p...policy?

1579
01:36:30,834 --> 01:36:33,554
In case you die in an accident
like the one that happened here...

1580
01:36:33,594 --> 01:36:35,594
Isn't this your wife?
 - Yes.

1581
01:36:35,594 --> 01:36:38,034
Do you you know how many Lakhs
you would get? - Is that so?

1582
01:36:38,034 --> 01:36:39,034
Get lost!

1583
01:36:39,074 --> 01:36:41,514
Don't talk nonsense.
 - It's not that, Chetta.

1584
01:36:41,674 --> 01:36:42,874
If you take the policy,

1585
01:36:42,914 --> 01:36:45,354
can't say when time favours me!
- Yeah, right!

1586
01:36:45,354 --> 01:36:47,314
You want time to favour
you with my death?

1587
01:36:47,354 --> 01:36:50,074
What the hell have you given
me while you're alive?

1588
01:36:50,074 --> 01:36:51,514
Just this stupid tea shop, right?

1589
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:54,194
I've been feeding you with this stupid
tea shop for the past 20 years.

1590
01:36:54,194 --> 01:36:55,794
You made it with my dad's money!

1591
01:36:55,794 --> 01:36:56,834
Take this & hit him!

1592
01:37:00,234 --> 01:37:02,594
What is this? - I'm seeing such
a fight for the first time.

1593
01:37:02,594 --> 01:37:04,234
What?
 - Usually I get beaten up, right?

1594
01:37:04,274 --> 01:37:06,034
What?
 - I mean, it was a good fight, right?

1595
01:37:06,074 --> 01:37:07,194
Sigh! I couldn't take part.

1596
01:37:07,194 --> 01:37:08,834
Hey! Boss!

1597
01:37:12,274 --> 01:37:13,834
I saw him being hit by the vehicle.

1598
01:37:15,514 --> 01:37:18,114
Heard that I'll get cash if I give
information? What's the deal?

1599
01:37:19,874 --> 01:37:20,994
50,000 Rupees.

1600
01:37:21,554 --> 01:37:23,754
Then I also saw the incident.
Give the money to me too.

1601
01:37:23,954 --> 01:37:25,754
My dear bro, he is bluffing.

1602
01:37:25,874 --> 01:37:28,554
I was the only one here then.
Not even a dog was here.

1603
01:37:29,714 --> 01:37:31,474
Where were you at the spot?

1604
01:37:33,594 --> 01:37:35,754
I was taking a shit over there.

1605
01:37:37,234 --> 01:37:38,514
I have the Lorry number.

1606
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:40,914
Give me the cash.

1607
01:37:42,314 --> 01:37:44,234
I'll give you an advance
of 2000 Rupees.

1608
01:37:44,314 --> 01:37:46,354
If the details you give are solid,

1609
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:49,314
come and collect the rest of
the money from our office.

1610
01:37:49,754 --> 01:37:50,874
After one week.

1611
01:37:51,234 --> 01:37:52,554
Okay.
 - Here is my card.

1612
01:37:53,674 --> 01:37:55,234
Full on fraud, huh?

1613
01:37:57,034 --> 01:37:58,474
No, bro!

1614
01:37:59,234 --> 01:38:01,874
Our company won't
release the fund

1615
01:38:01,914 --> 01:38:04,074
unless they verify the
information that you're giving.

1616
01:38:05,314 --> 01:38:07,354
E.. E...
- I know how to catch you, if you escape.

1617
01:38:11,034 --> 01:38:12,274
Here is the vehicle's number.

1618
01:38:13,514 --> 01:38:14,554
And...

1619
01:38:15,754 --> 01:38:16,874
I know the guy.

1620
01:38:17,674 --> 01:38:20,114
I will tell you that after getting
the money. Full cash, okay?

1621
01:38:20,154 --> 01:38:22,034
Okay then!
As we agreed upon!

1622
01:38:25,354 --> 01:38:26,434
He is an idiot.

1623
01:38:26,714 --> 01:38:28,034
He believed everything you said.

1624
01:38:28,074 --> 01:38:31,514
Anyway the investigation is scuss...
sucus.... Well, it worked out, right?

1625
01:38:32,154 --> 01:38:33,474
We got the vehicle
number, anyhow.

1626
01:38:35,114 --> 01:38:36,114
What is this, Advocate?

1627
01:38:37,834 --> 01:38:41,394
Whatever he said was a lie.
- No way.

1628
01:38:41,594 --> 01:38:43,034
I had noticed his eyeballs.

1629
01:38:43,114 --> 01:38:44,554
It went left.
So it's true.

1630
01:38:46,314 --> 01:38:48,994
It's true that the eyeball went left.

1631
01:38:49,554 --> 01:38:50,914
But did you notice?

1632
01:38:51,594 --> 01:38:53,394
He is a left hander.

1633
01:38:57,034 --> 01:38:59,154
When right handers say the truth,

1634
01:38:59,354 --> 01:39:01,114
the eyeball moves to the left.

1635
01:39:01,234 --> 01:39:03,314
When left handers say the truth,

1636
01:39:03,394 --> 01:39:04,914
the eyeballs go right.

1637
01:39:04,954 --> 01:39:08,434
This left hander's eyeball went left now.

1638
01:39:08,474 --> 01:39:10,234
So, he is lying.

1639
01:39:10,594 --> 01:39:12,234
Then, what do we do?

1640
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:17,274
This guy has some connection
with this incident.

1641
01:39:17,354 --> 01:39:19,554
You should f..follow him.

1642
01:39:19,714 --> 01:39:24,274
And keep me updated on every movement,
through the phone.

1643
01:39:24,314 --> 01:39:25,554
Okay Boss!

1644
01:39:27,114 --> 01:39:28,514
Wrong direction!

1645
01:39:31,434 --> 01:39:34,474
He is under my observation.
I'm following him now.

1646
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:36,874
Okay, Okay.

1647
01:39:37,314 --> 01:39:39,114
O dear God!
He would have seen me now.

1648
01:39:41,074 --> 01:39:43,034
Boss, I am in hiding now.
 - What?

1649
01:39:44,314 --> 01:39:45,914
Sir, they are fools.

1650
01:39:48,034 --> 01:39:49,154
Oh no! Dog!

1651
01:39:53,114 --> 01:39:55,674
Boss, he is in a liaison with someone.

1652
01:39:55,914 --> 01:39:59,394
What?
In between this, on the road?

1653
01:39:59,474 --> 01:40:01,874
Advocate, I mean he's
talking on the phone.

1654
01:40:01,914 --> 01:40:03,954
He's not alone, Sir.
There's a dwarf also with him.

1655
01:40:04,354 --> 01:40:08,194
You snatch that phone from
his hand and run away!

1656
01:40:08,194 --> 01:40:09,554
I've retired from snatching.

1657
01:40:09,994 --> 01:40:12,234
S... Snatch it and run!

1658
01:40:12,314 --> 01:40:13,834
I can't reduce the amount, Sir.

1659
01:40:14,234 --> 01:40:15,834
Come on, Sir.

1660
01:40:16,554 --> 01:40:17,554
My mobile!

1661
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:23,154
Advocate, I snatched it.
- Good.

1662
01:40:23,194 --> 01:40:25,554
D... D... D...
- What? You want a drum?

1663
01:40:26,034 --> 01:40:27,954
Don't get caught!
 - I won't!

1664
01:40:27,954 --> 01:40:29,154
Where are you now?

1665
01:40:29,194 --> 01:40:31,554
I'm running on the
parallel route now.

1666
01:40:31,714 --> 01:40:32,834
Running where?

1667
01:40:32,874 --> 01:40:34,594
Why are they snatching
the phone & running?

1668
01:40:34,754 --> 01:40:36,434
Stop!
 - Stay!

1669
01:40:40,194 --> 01:40:41,794
He is running on petrol or what?

1670
01:40:41,834 --> 01:40:42,914
He's not stopping!

1671
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:44,114
Move, kids!

1672
01:40:46,514 --> 01:40:48,034
Sorry kids.
I'm taking this.

1673
01:40:52,074 --> 01:40:53,954
Thank you brother. Please help me.
Yes, go fast.

1674
01:40:55,314 --> 01:40:58,274
R... Run!
 - I am running, Advocate!

1675
01:40:58,754 --> 01:41:01,354
They are phone thieves. Follow them.
- Leave me. I can't balance.

1676
01:41:01,354 --> 01:41:03,914
If I leave, I won't have any balance.

1677
01:41:03,954 --> 01:41:04,954
Here I go!

1678
01:41:05,194 --> 01:41:07,114
Which is this route?
I have no clue.

1679
01:41:07,114 --> 01:41:08,754
Oh! You guys are here?

1680
01:41:08,754 --> 01:41:11,834
Stop me somehow.
Hey car! Move away!

1681
01:41:16,834 --> 01:41:18,834
Did I reach outer space?

1682
01:41:19,594 --> 01:41:20,794
Where is this?

1683
01:41:23,154 --> 01:41:24,234
Driver!

1684
01:41:26,034 --> 01:41:28,194
Don't drive upside down.
Drive properly.

1685
01:41:31,554 --> 01:41:33,314
Where was I dropped from?

1686
01:41:43,474 --> 01:41:44,474
Hey!

1687
01:41:45,794 --> 01:41:46,914
Stop!

1688
01:41:53,954 --> 01:41:55,194
Where are you looking at?

1689
01:41:58,434 --> 01:42:00,194
Advocate!
Advocate!

1690
01:42:00,234 --> 01:42:01,954
Don't just stand there.
Run!

1691
01:42:01,994 --> 01:42:03,554
Where are you running to?

1692
01:42:03,594 --> 01:42:04,594
Forward.

1693
01:42:06,114 --> 01:42:08,194
Where are you?
 - He is behind me.

1694
01:42:08,994 --> 01:42:10,314
Behind me?

1695
01:42:10,314 --> 01:42:12,594
Where?
- Where should I come?

1696
01:42:13,194 --> 01:42:15,794
Where should I run to?
 - Over here.

1697
01:42:16,554 --> 01:42:17,754
Here.
- Where?

1698
01:42:18,154 --> 01:42:20,594
Next to the wall.
 - Which wall?

1699
01:42:20,674 --> 01:42:22,394
Where?
 - Not that way.

1700
01:42:22,794 --> 01:42:24,394
Come back
 - I can't come back.

1701
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:26,474
Then run! I'm on this side.

1702
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,394
Throw!
- Throw whom?

1703
01:42:28,394 --> 01:42:29,994
Throw the phone this side.
- Where?

1704
01:42:30,034 --> 01:42:32,194
This side of the wall.

1705
01:42:32,994 --> 01:42:33,994
Did you get it?

1706
01:42:34,394 --> 01:42:35,394
Got it.

1707
01:42:37,434 --> 01:42:40,354
98... 46...
Catch!

1708
01:42:40,394 --> 01:42:41,674
Isn't it wrong to catch her?

1709
01:42:41,754 --> 01:42:44,434
Phone is coming from the top. Catch!
- Oh! That?

1710
01:42:44,434 --> 01:42:45,594
Catch.

1711
01:42:46,434 --> 01:42:47,594
Let me take rest.

1712
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:48,994
Hey mobile thief!
Stop!

1713
01:42:49,234 --> 01:42:51,594
Where should I run to now?
- Don't run. Return the phone!

1714
01:42:51,594 --> 01:42:54,554
Then why did I run for so long?
- Say sorry and return the phone.

1715
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:55,954
Stop!

1716
01:43:07,954 --> 01:43:10,114
Hey you!
Mobile thief!

1717
01:43:10,154 --> 01:43:11,474
How dare you take my mobile?

1718
01:43:11,474 --> 01:43:13,474
Give my mobile!
 - Who are you?

1719
01:43:13,514 --> 01:43:15,314
Razak, come. Rashid, come.
- For what?

1720
01:43:15,394 --> 01:43:18,074
Break his head.
He's stealing my mobile from our area.

1721
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:19,594
I got the mobile.

1722
01:43:19,714 --> 01:43:20,794
Get up and go, you thief.

1723
01:43:21,394 --> 01:43:23,314
Is it okay if I get up
& go in the morning?

1724
01:43:23,354 --> 01:43:25,354
Morning or noon, go whenever you want.
- I'm really tired.

1725
01:43:27,754 --> 01:43:29,034
What was this for?

1726
01:43:33,914 --> 01:43:35,314
Do you want to puke, son?

1727
01:43:35,594 --> 01:43:38,114
I don't want to.
You go ahead, mom.

1728
01:43:40,234 --> 01:43:46,194
I have no idea how so many people can
beat up one man at the same time.

1729
01:43:47,354 --> 01:43:49,194
But I won't back out.

1730
01:43:49,874 --> 01:43:52,554
I will be after that stammerer.

1731
01:43:52,714 --> 01:43:54,994
Let me get up from this bed.

1732
01:43:55,314 --> 01:43:57,154
I don't think that
would happen now.

1733
01:43:57,234 --> 01:43:58,674
Whatever happened has happened.

1734
01:43:58,794 --> 01:44:01,194
You apply for a disabled's
pension as soon as possible.

1735
01:44:01,234 --> 01:44:04,074
What are you saying, dad?
Disabled's pension?

1736
01:44:04,114 --> 01:44:06,674
Isn't it better than you applying
for a widow's pension, right?

1737
01:44:08,114 --> 01:44:09,474
You are soaked in oil, man.

1738
01:44:09,594 --> 01:44:12,154
If you had applied some Masala as well,
we could have fried him.

1739
01:44:12,194 --> 01:44:13,314
This man is the limit!

1740
01:44:13,474 --> 01:44:15,834
Talking like this about someone
who's about to die? - Mom!

1741
01:44:18,074 --> 01:44:22,794
I got this number because Anzar
snatched his phone from him.

1742
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:26,519
Trace this number, bro.

1743
01:44:26,834 --> 01:44:28,703
We will get some kind of link.

1744
01:44:30,194 --> 01:44:31,274
Impressive!

1745
01:44:31,834 --> 01:44:33,074
This is smart work.

1746
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:35,914
But I don't think this number
would be a great break through.

1747
01:44:36,653 --> 01:44:40,133
We might be able to track the truck that
finished off Anuradha's dad. Maximum!

1748
01:44:40,834 --> 01:44:43,994
In all such contract works,
there would be 3-4 intermediaries.

1749
01:44:45,194 --> 01:44:46,194
Brother...

1750
01:44:46,474 --> 01:44:51,194
B... Before he died, Anuradha's
dad went to two places.

1751
01:44:51,834 --> 01:44:53,154
Two days before his death...

1752
01:44:53,914 --> 01:44:57,874
To Koonamkunnu Devi Temple,
which he believes in the most.

1753
01:44:58,394 --> 01:44:59,594
Then, to Trivandrum as well.

1754
01:44:59,834 --> 01:45:03,834
It's quite difficult for
people to reach Koonamkunnu...

1755
01:45:04,474 --> 01:45:07,194
And he goes there only once a year.

1756
01:45:07,474 --> 01:45:09,274
So why did he go there all of a sudden?

1757
01:45:10,194 --> 01:45:11,194
So...

1758
01:45:11,474 --> 01:45:15,074
his trip to Trivandrum
was that important.

1759
01:45:15,474 --> 01:45:18,554
There is some missing
link somewhere.

1760
01:45:21,234 --> 01:45:24,834
Show me the message that your
dad sent from Trivandrum.

1761
01:45:27,714 --> 01:45:28,714
Here.

1762
01:45:32,514 --> 01:45:35,234
Got down from the train.
I am going to meet him.

1763
01:45:35,594 --> 01:45:38,594
I'm lucky that Lord
Anjaneya is with me.

1764
01:45:39,594 --> 01:45:40,954
What's the point in this message?

1765
01:45:41,114 --> 01:45:42,114
It's useless.

1766
01:45:43,514 --> 01:45:45,594
One minute.
It's my dad.

1767
01:45:45,674 --> 01:45:46,954
Ha.. Ha... Hello!

1768
01:45:46,994 --> 01:45:48,874
Why are you laughing?
- I wasn't laughing.

1769
01:45:48,914 --> 01:45:50,394
He has changed quite a bit.

1770
01:45:51,154 --> 01:45:52,594
Reminds me of the old Balakrishnan.

1771
01:45:52,834 --> 01:45:55,234
You were his senior in college, right?

1772
01:45:57,234 --> 01:45:59,754
I was his senior and political guide.

1773
01:46:00,474 --> 01:46:01,474
He was firebrand.

1774
01:46:01,514 --> 01:46:05,914
'May the white flag fly high'

1775
01:46:07,717 --> 01:46:12,114
'May the blood in our bodies boil'

1776
01:46:12,724 --> 01:46:16,247
'Long Live Revolution'

1777
01:46:16,314 --> 01:46:19,554
His best friend was also
studying in Law College then.

1778
01:46:19,754 --> 01:46:21,114
He was in Balan's opposite party.

1779
01:46:21,354 --> 01:46:24,994
The differences in political ideologies
didn't affect their friendship.

1780
01:46:25,444 --> 01:46:32,954
SFY would never compromise in protecting the
rights of the student society of Kerala.

1781
01:46:32,954 --> 01:46:35,514
Some people are challenging from somewhere.

1782
01:46:35,554 --> 01:46:37,474
Politics in campus...
- Baletta!

1783
01:46:38,468 --> 01:46:40,570
They've brought goons from
outside to beat us up.

1784
01:47:36,154 --> 01:47:37,154
Leave me.

1785
01:47:40,927 --> 01:47:42,677
That was the beginning.

1786
01:47:43,084 --> 01:47:45,161
Mentally, he was shattered completely.

1787
01:47:56,565 --> 01:47:58,514
You killed my son?

1788
01:47:58,834 --> 01:48:00,434
He used to like you so much!

1789
01:48:00,754 --> 01:48:03,874
Yet why did you do this to him?

1790
01:48:08,834 --> 01:48:10,754
Don't cry.
Nothing will happen.

1791
01:48:11,794 --> 01:48:13,314
Get out of my sight.

1792
01:48:13,914 --> 01:48:15,914
I don't want to see you
ever again in my life.

1793
01:48:25,874 --> 01:48:28,194
I... I.. It wasn't on purpo...

1794
01:48:31,821 --> 01:48:33,594
M.... Mother!

1795
01:48:39,477 --> 01:48:42,157
When Balan returned to his
studies sometime later,

1796
01:48:42,347 --> 01:48:43,787
he wasn't the old Balan.

1797
01:48:44,236 --> 01:48:48,156
One who lost self-confidence in
between those incomplete words,

1798
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:49,421
the stammerer Balakrishnan.

1799
01:48:49,827 --> 01:48:51,707
When there's guilt deep
within your heart,

1800
01:48:51,754 --> 01:48:53,554
it's difficult to escape
from that, Anuradha.

1801
01:48:53,914 --> 01:48:56,194
I used to feel really sad
whenever I thought about him.

1802
01:48:57,274 --> 01:49:00,074
But now, everyone accepted
that he is like this.

1803
01:49:02,314 --> 01:49:04,154
Dad is really high.

1804
01:49:04,754 --> 01:49:07,514
And I'm fed up of that clown
brother in law of mine.

1805
01:49:07,954 --> 01:49:09,314
I forgot to tell you.

1806
01:49:09,474 --> 01:49:11,674
He told me that he's going
to follow you 24X7.

1807
01:49:12,274 --> 01:49:15,594
By following me,
he is getting thrashed royally as well.

1808
01:49:15,594 --> 01:49:17,234
Is it?
Then I'm relieved.

1809
01:49:17,394 --> 01:49:20,114
I'm leaving then.
I'll update you about this number.

1810
01:49:20,314 --> 01:49:21,354
Okay bro.

1811
01:49:24,045 --> 01:49:25,085
Hey Balan!

1812
01:49:25,994 --> 01:49:28,434
You should be careful.
You're taking a huge risk.

1813
01:49:29,714 --> 01:49:30,714
I know, bro.

1814
01:49:34,474 --> 01:49:35,474
Hey!

1815
01:49:35,954 --> 01:49:37,474
He was telling me that...

1816
01:49:37,674 --> 01:49:40,514
you haven't really had any
interactions with girls so far.

1817
01:49:40,834 --> 01:49:41,834
Is that true?

1818
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:45,954
Not even one?

1819
01:49:47,834 --> 01:49:48,914
Really?

1820
01:49:51,594 --> 01:49:54,314
I.... I am a

1821
01:49:55,674 --> 01:49:57,135
V.... Virgin!

1822
01:49:57,754 --> 01:49:58,754
Really?

1823
01:49:59,438 --> 01:50:01,118
50-50...

1824
01:50:05,274 --> 01:50:07,434
W... W... What about you?

1825
01:50:10,474 --> 01:50:11,594
75%

1826
01:50:13,794 --> 01:50:15,594
You are trying to fool me, right?

1827
01:50:17,074 --> 01:50:22,874
25% must be when someone kissed you in
childhood, during your naming ceremony.

1828
01:50:30,274 --> 01:50:32,874
K... Kiss was during childhood, right?

1829
01:50:32,994 --> 01:50:34,914
No one else should
kiss her from now on.

1830
01:50:34,914 --> 01:50:36,434
I won't allow that.
- Advo...

1831
01:50:37,034 --> 01:50:38,314
Isn't that Advocate?

1832
01:50:38,994 --> 01:50:40,274
It is him.

1833
01:50:40,714 --> 01:50:42,954
Hey!
Has our Advocate gone mad?

1834
01:50:43,314 --> 01:50:44,394
Mad?

1835
01:50:44,434 --> 01:50:46,954
Oh! You have fallen in love, huh?

1836
01:50:47,114 --> 01:50:48,394
We haven't fallen in anything.

1837
01:50:49,074 --> 01:50:50,474
Then why did your eyeball go right?

1838
01:50:50,514 --> 01:50:53,114
Hey! I was waiting for you.
Let's go to the colony together.

1839
01:50:53,154 --> 01:50:55,074
You take an auto rickshaw.
I have a meeting.

1840
01:50:55,394 --> 01:50:56,594
What meeting do you have?

1841
01:50:56,754 --> 01:50:58,594
'You are in love'.
- Get lost!

1842
01:51:00,554 --> 01:51:01,594
Yes, Advocate!

1843
01:51:01,594 --> 01:51:04,714
You should go to Trivandrum tomorrow.
- Okay.

1844
01:51:04,714 --> 01:51:07,994
At the auto stand at the r..
railway station,

1845
01:51:08,074 --> 01:51:11,114
there will be an auto rickshaw
named 'Anjaneyan'.

1846
01:51:12,234 --> 01:51:15,114
How will I find that?
- Go there and ask someone.

1847
01:51:15,234 --> 01:51:19,074
Anuradha's dad had gone
somewhere in that auto.

1848
01:51:19,154 --> 01:51:21,074
You should find out
where he went to.

1849
01:51:22,954 --> 01:51:24,194
Lord Anjaneya!

1850
01:51:25,394 --> 01:51:26,394
O Lord! Bless me!

1851
01:51:26,594 --> 01:51:28,474
What did you say?
- Anjaneya.

1852
01:51:30,954 --> 01:51:32,034
'Anjaneyan'

1853
01:51:32,394 --> 01:51:34,394
Is it Anjaneyan's auto?
- Yes.

1854
01:51:38,154 --> 01:51:39,794
Have you dropped
this guy somewhere?

1855
01:51:39,994 --> 01:51:41,114
This guy...

1856
01:51:42,274 --> 01:51:43,274
Yes.

1857
01:52:01,994 --> 01:52:03,034
Hi Sir.

1858
01:52:03,194 --> 01:52:04,554
Hey!
- I'm Rathnavel.

1859
01:52:04,594 --> 01:52:06,234
Ronald.
Please sit.

1860
01:52:06,834 --> 01:52:09,794
Your friend Dinakar has told me
a lot about you.

1861
01:52:10,434 --> 01:52:13,554
An encounter specialist,
who is also a professional assassin.

1862
01:52:15,354 --> 01:52:18,434
Interesting!
 - Actually, what's an encounter?

1863
01:52:18,754 --> 01:52:19,954
It's murder, right?

1864
01:52:20,234 --> 01:52:23,114
I am murdering for a monthly salary.

1865
01:52:23,474 --> 01:52:26,034
So if I get some extra money,
I'm still murdering.

1866
01:52:26,434 --> 01:52:28,914
Just keep adding to the
list of my encounters.

1867
01:52:30,394 --> 01:52:32,874
Tell me how you are going
to do this in Kerala.

1868
01:52:33,954 --> 01:52:35,914
Coimbatore, Chennai, Madras...

1869
01:52:36,274 --> 01:52:38,954
I have strong underworld
connections in all these places.

1870
01:52:39,514 --> 01:52:41,834
That's where I will recruit
the guys for the job.

1871
01:52:41,834 --> 01:52:43,594
I will also be at the
scene along with them.

1872
01:52:43,594 --> 01:52:45,314
It's gonna be my operation.
- That's good.

1873
01:52:45,994 --> 01:52:48,434
This is the target.
The details are in the file.

1874
01:52:48,954 --> 01:52:50,314
50 Lakhs in cash.

1875
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,354
After the job, another 50.

1876
01:53:17,754 --> 01:53:22,554
How come your father had so much
faith in this particular temple?

1877
01:53:23,194 --> 01:53:26,874
It's said that this is the origin
temple of dad's family deity.

1878
01:53:27,194 --> 01:53:28,434
The temple of the hill-men.

1879
01:53:37,554 --> 01:53:38,754
Where are you from?

1880
01:53:39,994 --> 01:53:41,514
K.. K..
- From Kochi.

1881
01:53:41,754 --> 01:53:44,394
Did you come here, to this
temple in particular? - Yes.

1882
01:53:44,674 --> 01:53:46,434
No one really comes here.
That's why I asked.

1883
01:53:47,474 --> 01:53:50,874
We need to make an offering in her name.

1884
01:53:50,914 --> 01:53:54,594
What is the main offering here?
 - Sacrifice.

1885
01:53:55,874 --> 01:53:57,074
Your name and star sign?

1886
01:53:57,354 --> 01:53:58,674
Anuradha, 'Uthram'.

1887
01:54:00,754 --> 01:54:03,074
What's you father's name?
 - Sudarshan.

1888
01:54:04,034 --> 01:54:05,474
Oh! That's what!

1889
01:54:05,874 --> 01:54:07,314
Otherwise you won't be coming here.

1890
01:54:08,514 --> 01:54:09,714
Where is your father?

1891
01:54:11,474 --> 01:54:12,554
Dad is no more.

1892
01:54:13,194 --> 01:54:14,274
It was an accident.

1893
01:54:16,274 --> 01:54:17,954
So he had foreseen it.

1894
01:54:18,754 --> 01:54:20,314
Why did you say so?

1895
01:54:20,354 --> 01:54:21,874
He had come here 1.5 weeks back.

1896
01:54:22,074 --> 01:54:23,394
He stood & prayed
for a long time.

1897
01:54:23,994 --> 01:54:26,834
'My daughter would come here looking
for me, if something happens to me'

1898
01:54:26,914 --> 01:54:31,314
'If she doesn't come, and if you hear about
my death, you should go to her, Priest'

1899
01:54:31,994 --> 01:54:35,874
'Give this to her, saying that I gave it'.
He gave me a cover saying that.

1900
01:54:58,954 --> 01:55:00,034
Who are you?

1901
01:55:11,394 --> 01:55:13,074
Sir, I've got an envelope.

1902
01:55:13,114 --> 01:55:14,234
What should I do?

1903
01:55:14,594 --> 01:55:15,794
Open it.

1904
01:55:29,914 --> 01:55:31,914
Sir, inside it, there's a receipt...

1905
01:55:34,194 --> 01:55:35,314
a letter,

1906
01:55:37,194 --> 01:55:38,354
and a key.

1907
01:55:40,354 --> 01:55:42,354
Click the picture of the
letter & the receipt.

1908
01:55:42,434 --> 01:55:43,474
Sure.

1909
01:55:47,434 --> 01:55:49,034
You keep the receipt and the key.

1910
01:55:49,874 --> 01:55:50,874
Okay.

1911
01:55:51,114 --> 01:55:52,274
What about the letter, Sir?

1912
01:55:52,874 --> 01:55:54,834
Burn it right in
front of his eyes.

1913
01:56:01,594 --> 01:56:03,754
Burned it, Sir.
What's next?

1914
01:56:04,354 --> 01:56:05,434
Now shoot them down.

1915
01:58:12,914 --> 01:58:14,714
G.... Give me the key!

1916
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:15,954
G.. Give!

1917
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:22,754
Balu, come.
Let's go.

1918
01:58:31,326 --> 01:58:35,854
We could get away because that
priest came with a crowd.

1919
01:58:35,879 --> 01:58:39,199
Or else the Forest Department & the Police
would have created a lot of trouble.

1920
01:58:40,214 --> 01:58:42,134
Who is following us so relentlessly?

1921
01:58:42,254 --> 01:58:44,174
Isn't this the second
attack towards us?

1922
01:58:45,254 --> 01:58:49,254
Didn't I tell you?
You are trapped in a big game.

1923
01:58:50,494 --> 01:58:51,814
I'm feeling really scared.

1924
01:58:52,654 --> 01:58:55,454
Whatever dad wanted to tell me, would
have been in that letter, right?

1925
01:58:56,334 --> 01:58:57,814
In front of our eyes, it was...

1926
01:58:59,054 --> 01:59:00,054
No need to worry.

1927
01:59:00,334 --> 01:59:02,654
Your dad's blessings
are still with you.

1928
01:59:09,774 --> 01:59:11,974
We should reach there
before that Tamilian.

1929
01:59:12,014 --> 01:59:13,014
Where?

1930
01:59:28,014 --> 01:59:29,014
It's him.

1931
01:59:29,734 --> 01:59:30,974
Let's hide.

1932
01:59:39,494 --> 01:59:41,294
We got late.

1933
01:59:41,934 --> 01:59:44,694
If your dad had kept anything
in that cl... clo... Damn it!

1934
01:59:44,694 --> 01:59:48,574
... in that locker room, he would
have taken it by now.

1935
01:59:49,774 --> 01:59:50,774
Come, Advocate.

1936
01:59:51,054 --> 01:59:52,254
What's the point now?

1937
01:59:52,414 --> 01:59:55,134
My dad always says that 'There's
always a Plan B', right?

1938
01:59:55,174 --> 01:59:57,334
There would be something
like that here as well. Come!

1939
02:00:01,974 --> 02:00:05,214
Sir, can we open & see the locker kept
by the person who just left from here?

1940
02:00:05,254 --> 02:00:07,054
Who are you?
What's the problem?

1941
02:00:07,934 --> 02:00:09,934
Sir, that was my father's locker.

1942
02:00:09,974 --> 02:00:12,054
The guy who left, snatched
that receipt from me.

1943
02:00:12,214 --> 02:00:15,654
You complain to the police then.
He took whatever was in there.

1944
02:00:15,694 --> 02:00:17,414
What's the point in
seeing an empty locker?

1945
02:00:17,614 --> 02:00:19,334
Sir, I just need to see it open.

1946
02:00:19,374 --> 02:00:20,374
What for?

1947
02:00:21,294 --> 02:00:25,054
Sir, what's the problem in opening
& seeing that empty locker?

1948
02:00:25,934 --> 02:00:28,974
S... S.. Sir...
P... Please help.

1949
02:00:29,014 --> 02:00:30,654
You're adamant that
you'll spoil me?

1950
02:00:30,694 --> 02:00:31,774
Come. I'll show it.

1951
02:00:36,774 --> 02:00:37,774
Have a look!

1952
02:00:48,214 --> 02:00:49,494
There is nothing inside.

1953
02:01:04,174 --> 02:01:06,454
Y... Your father is b... brilliant.

1954
02:01:07,054 --> 02:01:11,294
Two things that he always
used to tell you, are right.

1955
02:01:12,014 --> 02:01:13,894
T... There is always a plan B.

1956
02:01:14,294 --> 02:01:15,294
And...

1957
02:01:15,494 --> 02:01:16,774
Life is a puzzle.

1958
02:01:17,174 --> 02:01:18,174
Yes...

1959
02:01:18,374 --> 02:01:19,374
It's a puzzle.

1960
02:01:20,294 --> 02:01:21,894
We need to solve it.

1961
02:01:35,254 --> 02:01:37,454
This is the USB I found from
that cloak room locker.

1962
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:40,894
Was there anything else in that locker?

1963
02:01:41,454 --> 02:01:42,654
There was nothing else, Sir.

1964
02:01:42,774 --> 02:01:44,214
I haven't copied
anything from this.

1965
02:01:45,014 --> 02:01:46,174
This is your property,

1966
02:01:47,254 --> 02:01:50,454
And also, I've erased the pictures of
the letter & receipt from my phone.

1967
02:01:50,494 --> 02:01:51,814
I know... I know...

1968
02:01:51,854 --> 02:01:52,854
Thank you.

1969
02:01:53,254 --> 02:01:56,454
You've got all the money I promised, right?
- Yes, Sir. Many thanks.

1970
02:01:56,774 --> 02:01:59,214
It was an absolute pleasure
working with you. - Same here.

1971
02:02:25,374 --> 02:02:26,974
No loose ends, right?

1972
02:02:27,454 --> 02:02:28,454
Yeah.

1973
02:02:28,654 --> 02:02:31,774
Advocate Balan will be in trouble when
the news of this guy's death comes out.

1974
02:02:31,814 --> 02:02:33,494
He will be in big trouble.

1975
02:02:43,494 --> 02:02:44,654
Shouldn't miss a single one.

1976
02:02:45,134 --> 02:02:46,374
Copy everything into this.

1977
02:02:46,854 --> 02:02:48,654
I'm short on memory.

1978
02:02:48,974 --> 02:02:50,414
This, right?
- Yes.

1979
02:02:50,414 --> 02:02:51,774
What's this?

1980
02:02:52,054 --> 02:02:55,614
Your selfie looks like an Orangutan!

1981
02:02:56,054 --> 02:02:57,054
Like whom?

1982
02:02:57,094 --> 02:02:59,014
O... Orang
- Orangutan.

1983
02:02:59,974 --> 02:03:02,494
I think he said the name of the
Prime Minister of some country.

1984
02:03:02,694 --> 02:03:03,974
Do I look like him?

1985
02:03:04,494 --> 02:03:06,054
Ditto!
You want to see him?

1986
02:03:11,934 --> 02:03:13,414
This thing looks like his dad!

1987
02:03:14,094 --> 02:03:15,094
That's true.

1988
02:03:15,294 --> 02:03:16,414
I'll copy it myself.

1989
02:03:16,854 --> 02:03:17,854
Okay.

1990
02:03:19,654 --> 02:03:20,654
There's a problem, Balan.

1991
02:03:22,014 --> 02:03:23,334
What happened, bro?

1992
02:03:23,374 --> 02:03:26,814
Didn't you tell me over the phone, about
an attack against you at Koonamkunnu?

1993
02:03:28,094 --> 02:03:30,334
That assault was led by
a guy called Rathnavel.

1994
02:03:30,694 --> 02:03:32,174
An ACP in Tamil Nadu Police.

1995
02:03:32,414 --> 02:03:34,254
But the problem here is that...

1996
02:03:34,774 --> 02:03:37,014
his body was found abandoned.

1997
02:03:37,854 --> 02:03:39,134
He was shot at point blank.

1998
02:03:41,734 --> 02:03:45,094
Police has got clear information
about the incident at Koonamkunnu.

1999
02:03:45,414 --> 02:03:48,174
The Commissioner's team is on its way here,
to arrest you.

2000
02:03:49,014 --> 02:03:51,374
ADGP's conclusion is that
you have murdered him.

2001
02:03:52,134 --> 02:03:55,414
They can't touch you in DG's case,
because you are the victim's lawyer.

2002
02:03:55,974 --> 02:03:59,774
And Madam hasn't believed the
statements you & Anuradha gave me.

2003
02:04:01,654 --> 02:04:05,574
They are seeing you as the kingpin
of a crime of immense proportion.

2004
02:04:06,134 --> 02:04:07,134
King Kong?

2005
02:04:07,214 --> 02:04:10,734
Can't say what all they are
going to frame you for.

2006
02:04:11,094 --> 02:04:12,214
You are in trouble, Balan.

2007
02:04:13,134 --> 02:04:14,214
What will we do now?

2008
02:04:16,494 --> 02:04:18,694
L.. Le... Let them arrest me.

2009
02:04:19,654 --> 02:04:21,654
That's what I also want.

2010
02:04:22,134 --> 02:04:23,494
What are you saying?

2011
02:04:52,774 --> 02:04:53,774
Bro!

2012
02:04:53,894 --> 02:04:55,174
This is that girl.

2013
02:04:55,654 --> 02:04:56,854
It's her...

2014
02:04:59,894 --> 02:05:04,174
The one who fooled me & brother in law,
using Anu's identity.

2015
02:05:04,174 --> 02:05:07,494
Y... You should find her for m... me.

2016
02:05:07,894 --> 02:05:09,214
Make it real fast.

2017
02:05:25,454 --> 02:05:26,454
Move away!

2018
02:05:34,294 --> 02:05:37,334
Move! Sir, he is t... trouble
- Mind your own business.

2019
02:05:41,574 --> 02:05:43,094
What's the problem, Sir?

2020
02:05:47,854 --> 02:05:49,054
Come, Advocate.
Let's go.

2021
02:05:49,694 --> 02:05:51,174
This time, it's murder.

2022
02:05:51,214 --> 02:05:52,414
You're quite something, huh?

2023
02:05:52,734 --> 02:05:53,734
Come, let's move.

2024
02:06:30,694 --> 02:06:36,014
'Looking into the eyes,
without speaking anything'

2025
02:06:36,014 --> 02:06:41,094
'Time is disappearing,
after a handshake'

2026
02:06:41,414 --> 02:06:46,734
'Tears don't cease,
though they are unable to pour'

2027
02:06:46,974 --> 02:06:52,054
'Something is burning within'

2028
02:06:52,414 --> 02:06:57,854
'In a dark desert,
with incomplete sentences'

2029
02:06:57,854 --> 02:07:03,294
'You're a bird without wings to help you'

2030
02:07:03,454 --> 02:07:08,454
'All over the mind locked in darkness'

2031
02:07:08,734 --> 02:07:13,934
'I'm making a colourful
painting of yours, O' Dawn!'

2032
02:07:14,334 --> 02:07:19,214
'All over the mind locked in darkness'

2033
02:07:19,694 --> 02:07:24,294
'I'm making a colourful
painting of yours, O' Dawn!'

2034
02:07:25,174 --> 02:07:30,494
'Looking into the eyes,
without speaking anything'

2035
02:07:30,694 --> 02:07:36,374
'Time is disappearing,
after a handshake'

2036
02:08:08,854 --> 02:08:14,174
'As you drift away through the
ghats in the scorching summer'

2037
02:08:14,334 --> 02:08:19,654
'My heart is trembling to provide
a shade of feathers for you'

2038
02:08:19,654 --> 02:08:24,454
'My mind is burning within as hot ember'

2039
02:08:25,054 --> 02:08:30,214
'A sense of bereavement like never before'

2040
02:08:30,334 --> 02:08:35,894
'You are the shining star of my life'

2041
02:08:45,134 --> 02:08:46,494
What is this, Balakrishnan?

2042
02:08:47,014 --> 02:08:49,574
They're saying that you're
not co-operating with them?

2043
02:08:50,254 --> 02:08:52,694
If you stay quiet,
you will be in even more trouble.

2044
02:08:55,214 --> 02:08:56,214
Okay then.

2045
02:08:56,494 --> 02:08:58,014
Let them ask in their own way.

2046
02:08:59,774 --> 02:09:00,894
M... Madam.

2047
02:09:03,334 --> 02:09:05,174
I... want to talk.

2048
02:09:05,214 --> 02:09:06,814
To you, alone.

2049
02:09:12,814 --> 02:09:13,854
Close the door.

2050
02:09:19,694 --> 02:09:22,854
They will reach here in ten minutes.
They have started from there, with him.

2051
02:09:23,894 --> 02:09:26,654
I told him several times that
we'll get a senior lawyer.

2052
02:09:27,094 --> 02:09:29,014
He's adamant that he'll plead himself.

2053
02:09:29,054 --> 02:09:32,694
He'll plead his own case and
come out easily. He is awesome.

2054
02:09:33,334 --> 02:09:35,774
They would have hurt
him physically, right?

2055
02:09:36,494 --> 02:09:38,014
They are policemen, right Anuradha?

2056
02:09:38,134 --> 02:09:40,294
He's saying that as if
he's not a policeman.

2057
02:09:54,014 --> 02:09:58,214
Crime no 256/2017.
S Balakrishnan.

2058
02:10:04,134 --> 02:10:05,134
Your Honour...

2059
02:10:05,214 --> 02:10:09,894
If you examine exhibits 8 to 16,
presented before the Honourable Court,

2060
02:10:09,894 --> 02:10:13,734
the accused has filed a molestation
case for a client,

2061
02:10:13,774 --> 02:10:16,894
against the State Police Chief, which
doesn't have any credibility Prima Facie.

2062
02:10:17,014 --> 02:10:20,014
And it's clear that he
changed his statement later.

2063
02:10:20,054 --> 02:10:23,014
We can guess that it's a hired job
done by Advocate Balakrishnan,

2064
02:10:23,054 --> 02:10:26,134
for a crime syndicate,
that is yet to be found.

2065
02:10:27,134 --> 02:10:29,374
If one of the best officers
from Tamil Nadu Police

2066
02:10:29,614 --> 02:10:32,494
had reached Kerala in search
of the accused, Balakrishnan,

2067
02:10:33,134 --> 02:10:35,174
that definitely
points fingers at...

2068
02:10:35,174 --> 02:10:38,414
... the secrets behind the crime
targeting the State Police Chief.

2069
02:10:39,614 --> 02:10:42,094
The mission of the police
is to prove the connection,

2070
02:10:42,134 --> 02:10:46,654
between the conspiracy against the DGP &
the murder committed by the accused now.

2071
02:10:47,174 --> 02:10:51,774
Since granting bail to the accused in this
situation would affect the investigation,

2072
02:10:52,014 --> 02:10:56,054
I humbly request the Honourable Court
to reject the bail plea of the accused,

2073
02:10:56,134 --> 02:10:58,694
and to extend his
remand time period.

2074
02:11:02,614 --> 02:11:04,134
You may please present your case.

2075
02:11:18,294 --> 02:11:20,774
Yes, Your Honour.

2076
02:11:23,854 --> 02:11:25,774
Advocate, will you finish this today?

2077
02:11:29,014 --> 02:11:30,014
Silence!

2078
02:11:33,494 --> 02:11:35,054
I have many more
cases to hear today.

2079
02:11:35,294 --> 02:11:36,294
Continue.

2080
02:11:39,254 --> 02:11:42,654
What the Honourable Prosecutor
has said here, are not lies.

2081
02:11:42,654 --> 02:11:44,094
They are all half-truths.

2082
02:11:45,654 --> 02:11:52,294
There are two things in the statement I
gave to Assistant Commissioner Vincent.

2083
02:11:52,654 --> 02:11:53,654
One...

2084
02:11:53,694 --> 02:11:59,294
It was an unknown girl who approached
me using Anuradha's identity.

2085
02:11:59,334 --> 02:12:00,334
Secondly...

2086
02:12:00,374 --> 02:12:05,814
I wasn't aware that the legal notice was
being sent to the State Police Chief.

2087
02:12:07,454 --> 02:12:12,974
Since I sent a legal notice to the
State Police Chief by mistake...

2088
02:12:13,214 --> 02:12:18,134
... the police has shown extreme
enmity towards me ever since that day.

2089
02:12:20,214 --> 02:12:23,334
The statement I gave before ACP Vincent,

2090
02:12:23,774 --> 02:12:27,254
was recorded by the Police by threatening
me and putting me under pressure.

2091
02:12:28,374 --> 02:12:30,774
You mean, you're retracting
that statement now.

2092
02:12:30,934 --> 02:12:34,094
That is, the notice you sent
to the State Police Chief,

2093
02:12:34,214 --> 02:12:35,814
was sent with full awareness.

2094
02:12:36,374 --> 02:12:40,814
My client Anuradha Sudarshan is
also present in this Court now.

2095
02:12:41,174 --> 02:12:46,174
Me and my client want to present some
extremely confidential information,

2096
02:12:46,254 --> 02:12:49,574
before the Honourable Court.

2097
02:12:51,574 --> 02:12:55,934
I pray for a prudent, patient,
closed door hearing, Your Honour.

2098
02:12:56,014 --> 02:12:57,414
Objection, Your Honour!

2099
02:12:57,854 --> 02:12:58,854
Why?

2100
02:12:59,014 --> 02:13:02,654
What is objectionable about him soliciting
a closed door hearing, Madam Prosecutor?

2101
02:13:03,014 --> 02:13:04,054
Objection over-ruled.

2102
02:13:05,974 --> 02:13:09,214
Except Balakrishnan and Anuradha
Sudarshan, everyone else may leave.

2103
02:13:40,254 --> 02:13:43,414
The Court has heard the pleas of the
Prosecution & Advocate Balakrishnan.

2104
02:13:43,654 --> 02:13:46,094
The Court understands the
seriousness of the revelation...

2105
02:13:46,134 --> 02:13:48,654
...made by Advocate
Balakrishnan to the Court.

2106
02:13:49,854 --> 02:13:53,214
Bail is granted for Balakrishnan,
upon certain conditions.

2107
02:13:57,894 --> 02:14:00,494
Everything will be all right
by sunrise tomorrow, bro.

2108
02:14:00,574 --> 02:14:02,694
Until then, I want to stay alive.

2109
02:14:02,974 --> 02:14:04,934
That is the challenge before me.

2110
02:14:06,094 --> 02:14:09,214
The girl who fooled me posing as her?

2111
02:14:09,214 --> 02:14:11,214
Didn't you say that
you tracked her?

2112
02:14:11,494 --> 02:14:12,814
Not just her...

2113
02:14:12,974 --> 02:14:15,094
I went behind the phone
number you gave me earlier,

2114
02:14:15,414 --> 02:14:18,014
and traced the truck that
killed Anuradha's father.

2115
02:14:18,894 --> 02:14:20,734
The driver was taken
into custody last night.

2116
02:14:21,494 --> 02:14:23,414
And that girl...
She is a big shot.

2117
02:14:23,694 --> 02:14:25,414
You have a client
called Ronald, right?

2118
02:14:25,894 --> 02:14:29,094
The one who was caught for transporting
3 Crores of banned currency in his car?

2119
02:14:29,614 --> 02:14:32,494
She is his partner.
Her name is Tina Shankar.

2120
02:14:33,774 --> 02:14:37,414
Until tomorrow morning,
you both should be very careful.

2121
02:14:38,254 --> 02:14:39,654
Where are you going now?

2122
02:14:40,094 --> 02:14:42,094
D... Don't ask me anything now.

2123
02:14:43,374 --> 02:14:45,814
Don't play around, Balan.
I am in charge of your protection.

2124
02:14:46,014 --> 02:14:48,374
If something happens to you,
I am answerable to the Court.

2125
02:14:49,614 --> 02:14:51,414
If something happens to me,

2126
02:14:51,454 --> 02:14:53,694
then what's the point of
questions and answers?

2127
02:16:10,494 --> 02:16:12,214
Hi, Advocate Balakrishnan.

2128
02:16:12,654 --> 02:16:13,894
I was expecting you.

2129
02:16:14,854 --> 02:16:15,854
Come on in.

2130
02:16:27,454 --> 02:16:28,494
I know...

2131
02:16:29,014 --> 02:16:30,414
you are expecting me.

2132
02:16:32,974 --> 02:16:36,654
Is your p.. partner R... Ronald
doing good, M... Madam?

2133
02:16:36,854 --> 02:16:37,854
He is fine.

2134
02:16:38,014 --> 02:16:39,574
Ronald is also waiting for you.

2135
02:16:39,974 --> 02:16:41,014
Two minutes.

2136
02:16:41,334 --> 02:16:44,294
Ronald has sent someone
to take you to him.

2137
02:16:44,614 --> 02:16:45,894
You both wait here.
Come!

2138
02:16:46,494 --> 02:16:48,174
You proved that you're
really smart twice,

2139
02:16:48,214 --> 02:16:50,894
during each of those two
attacks against you.

2140
02:16:52,934 --> 02:16:53,934
But I'm confident.

2141
02:16:54,694 --> 02:16:55,774
I can handle you.

2142
02:16:56,214 --> 02:16:57,774
And my people are just outside.

2143
02:17:00,694 --> 02:17:01,694
Sorry!

2144
02:17:17,254 --> 02:17:18,774
You take care of Madam.
I need him!

2145
02:17:29,694 --> 02:17:30,734
Look over there.

2146
02:18:11,754 --> 02:18:14,114
Welcome to my art studio,
Mr. Balakrishnan.

2147
02:18:15,843 --> 02:18:19,563
I trusted Pramod's remark that you
are a most inefficient lawyer.

2148
02:18:20,057 --> 02:18:21,337
And that was my mistake.

2149
02:18:22,254 --> 02:18:23,414
You know,

2150
02:18:23,486 --> 02:18:25,366
people say art is all about life.

2151
02:18:25,808 --> 02:18:27,648
I would say art is about death too.

2152
02:18:27,816 --> 02:18:31,056
You won't be going out
from this setting.

2153
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:35,416
That's a good thing, Sir.

2154
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,240
B... But you should do something now.

2155
02:18:38,856 --> 02:18:41,056
Your p.... partner Tina Shankar...

2156
02:18:41,569 --> 02:18:43,489
Just try to find out
where she is now.

2157
02:18:54,854 --> 02:18:55,854
Where is she?

2158
02:18:56,374 --> 02:18:57,734
Or I will shoot your brains out.

2159
02:18:59,054 --> 02:19:00,894
D... Don't threaten me, Sir.

2160
02:19:01,414 --> 02:19:03,134
What did you think?

2161
02:19:03,574 --> 02:19:05,694
That these guys caught
me & brought me here?

2162
02:19:06,069 --> 02:19:08,829
I surrendered to them deliberately, Sir.

2163
02:19:10,134 --> 02:19:11,934
Isn't he here, Sir?

2164
02:19:12,294 --> 02:19:15,054
To destroy the credibility
of a person...

2165
02:19:15,094 --> 02:19:17,294
To destroy the bonafides...

2166
02:19:17,319 --> 02:19:21,279
The one who designed such a crime
that no has imagined so far...

2167
02:19:21,934 --> 02:19:23,054
The master brain!

2168
02:19:39,654 --> 02:19:41,374
Have you dropped
this guy anywhere?

2169
02:19:42,027 --> 02:19:43,027
Yes.

2170
02:19:43,052 --> 02:19:45,092
Where?
- At the Police Headquarters.

2171
02:20:36,894 --> 02:20:39,294
If so much is clear....

2172
02:20:40,104 --> 02:20:42,864
... the rest can be guessed easily, Sir.

2173
02:20:44,571 --> 02:20:47,291
A total of 156 crores...

2174
02:20:48,208 --> 02:20:49,768
... and 36 lakhs.
- Yes.

2175
02:20:50,904 --> 02:20:55,984
You will drive your car, with Rs. 3 Crores,
through the bypass road, towards Aroor.

2176
02:20:57,104 --> 02:20:59,944
300 metres after you leave from here,
there would be a police checking.

2177
02:21:00,470 --> 02:21:01,870
They will confiscate all the cash.

2178
02:21:01,895 --> 02:21:05,215
I'll ask the entire police force of the
city to concentrate on that incident.

2179
02:21:06,655 --> 02:21:08,415
A diversion strategy!

2180
02:21:08,632 --> 02:21:13,152
So, with the balance of 153 Crores
and 36 Lakhs, this container...

2181
02:21:15,054 --> 02:21:17,814
... will be on transit to the
Vallarpadam Container Terminal.

2182
02:21:18,254 --> 02:21:21,014
I have done what's necessary to
ensure its smooth running till there.

2183
02:21:21,294 --> 02:21:22,294
Perfect!

2184
02:21:23,633 --> 02:21:25,553
Are you blackmailing me?
- No.

2185
02:21:26,448 --> 02:21:29,128
I know, I am doing a big mistake.

2186
02:21:29,678 --> 02:21:30,678
But...

2187
02:21:31,071 --> 02:21:32,671
there is a great virtue in this, Sir.

2188
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:35,320
My daughter's life.

2189
02:21:37,568 --> 02:21:39,568
You should give me Rs. 5 Crores.

2190
02:21:40,385 --> 02:21:42,785
You can decide how you
want to give it to me.

2191
02:21:43,294 --> 02:21:44,414
What if I don't?

2192
02:21:46,294 --> 02:21:47,294
See...

2193
02:21:47,574 --> 02:21:49,094
... you are an intelligent man, Sir.

2194
02:21:50,294 --> 02:21:52,574
You know what all I can do, right?

2195
02:21:53,774 --> 02:21:54,814
You will give it.

2196
02:21:55,744 --> 02:21:58,744
If something happens to me,
I've made all arrangements...

2197
02:21:59,074 --> 02:22:01,994
... for this memory card containing
these visuals to reach my daughter.

2198
02:22:02,824 --> 02:22:04,944
She will come after you, Sir.

2199
02:22:05,791 --> 02:22:07,791
She is a brave girl.

2200
02:22:16,792 --> 02:22:19,552
It was someone who had no
communications with me or Ronald,

2201
02:22:19,577 --> 02:22:21,137
who dealt with
that lorry driver.

2202
02:22:21,503 --> 02:22:22,543
So...

2203
02:22:23,895 --> 02:22:25,575
Nothing will come out of it.

2204
02:22:26,448 --> 02:22:30,768
If those visuals which were the
evidence against you reached Anuradha,

2205
02:22:30,793 --> 02:22:32,353
she would expose it.

2206
02:22:32,625 --> 02:22:34,945
If you had killed Anuradha immediately,

2207
02:22:35,192 --> 02:22:38,152
that would get connected
with her father's murder.

2208
02:22:38,934 --> 02:22:39,934
So...

2209
02:22:40,558 --> 02:22:46,118
You found an alternative that no
one else has thought of, so far.

2210
02:22:48,830 --> 02:22:52,270
To destroy Anuradha's credibility.

2211
02:22:53,494 --> 02:22:58,774
A fake molestation complaint against you,
in Anuradha's name.

2212
02:22:59,414 --> 02:23:02,414
To send the legal notice,
you decided to use me.

2213
02:23:02,593 --> 02:23:04,633
You made my brother in
law a pawn in this.

2214
02:23:04,994 --> 02:23:09,634
If Anuradha files a complaint
about your actual crime later on,

2215
02:23:10,149 --> 02:23:13,989
no court would believe her
statement Prima Facie.

2216
02:23:15,415 --> 02:23:21,415
We became the main characters in the
conspiracy against the Police Chief.

2217
02:23:23,934 --> 02:23:26,854
It's a clean case.
Isn't it sir?

2218
02:23:27,934 --> 02:23:30,534
We needn't worry about where
he has taken Tina to.

2219
02:23:31,694 --> 02:23:34,134
Even if she is with his friend Vincent,

2220
02:23:35,174 --> 02:23:36,254
we are quite safe.

2221
02:23:37,174 --> 02:23:39,214
Because I am still
heading the State Police.

2222
02:23:40,894 --> 02:23:41,894
So,

2223
02:23:42,294 --> 02:23:43,294
finish him!

2224
02:23:45,352 --> 02:23:46,712
Finish them both...

2225
02:23:49,086 --> 02:23:50,126
... and call me.

2226
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:52,233
Yes, Sir.
I will.

2227
02:24:11,454 --> 02:24:12,454
Advocate...

2228
02:24:13,134 --> 02:24:15,374
Tina Shankar is very
important to me.

2229
02:24:16,416 --> 02:24:18,176
I don't know what you did to her.

2230
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:20,079
But...

2231
02:24:21,328 --> 02:24:22,848
I am a businessman.

2232
02:24:23,431 --> 02:24:26,391
My accounts must be in tally, always.

2233
02:24:29,134 --> 02:24:30,134
Look.

2234
02:24:44,095 --> 02:24:45,773
She has 5 minutes.

2235
02:24:46,433 --> 02:24:47,593
Just 5 minutes.

2236
02:24:49,551 --> 02:24:51,951
Your time starts... now!

2237
02:28:14,894 --> 02:28:15,894
Hey!

2238
02:28:16,254 --> 02:28:17,414
A... Anu!

2239
02:28:19,054 --> 02:28:20,054
Anu!

2240
02:28:39,654 --> 02:28:40,854
Put your gun down.

2241
02:28:45,494 --> 02:28:51,734
Anu & I are victims of a crime that
no one has even imagined until now.

2242
02:29:13,775 --> 02:29:18,495
The charge against the accused in this
case, has been proved beyond doubt.

2243
02:29:19,536 --> 02:29:25,376
So first three among the accused in this
case are sentenced to life imprisonment.

2244
02:29:26,951 --> 02:29:30,991
The next among the accused from 4 to 12,
are sentenced to 8 years of imprisonment.

2245
02:29:32,055 --> 02:29:35,495
When the police investigation was stuck,
this case made a breakthrough,

2246
02:29:35,649 --> 02:29:37,569
through Advocate
Balakrishnan's investigation.

2247
02:29:38,224 --> 02:29:39,464
At one instance during that,

2248
02:29:39,551 --> 02:29:41,311
trusting the Court,

2249
02:29:41,338 --> 02:29:42,978
the revelations that he made,

2250
02:29:43,892 --> 02:29:48,972
proves Advocate Balakrishnan's unflinching
trust in the judicial system.

2251
02:29:50,207 --> 02:29:52,047
It's not how a person says something...

2252
02:29:52,462 --> 02:29:54,702
It's 'What' a person is
saying, that matters.

2253
02:29:57,814 --> 02:29:59,214
Court is adjourned!

2254
02:30:41,414 --> 02:30:42,414
Leave me!

2255
02:30:50,614 --> 02:30:54,014
V... V... Vidya!

2256
02:31:15,694 --> 02:31:16,694
That's all!

2257
02:31:17,115 --> 02:31:18,995
Don't carry any wound forever.

2258
02:31:19,523 --> 02:31:21,561
You should let go of it.
Let it go!

2259
02:31:21,633 --> 02:31:23,873
Because of your action,
I became a limp.

2260
02:31:24,809 --> 02:31:26,849
And due to that guilt,
you became a stammerer.

2261
02:31:27,814 --> 02:31:29,414
So, we're level!

2262
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:31,280
Right?

2263
02:31:34,606 --> 02:31:36,726
You're a superstar!

2264
02:31:37,294 --> 02:31:41,094
I got an o... opportunity.
I used it.

2265
02:31:41,094 --> 02:31:43,254
Who brought this opportunity to you?
Me, right?

2266
02:31:43,294 --> 02:31:44,654
I left the police, bro!

2267
02:31:44,694 --> 02:31:46,814
People are swearing at my
mom from every corner.

2268
02:31:46,854 --> 02:31:48,574
I will be your clerk from now on.

2269
02:31:48,654 --> 02:31:49,654
Please!

2270
02:31:50,134 --> 02:31:52,214
I'll get you good money
from your opponent side.

2271
02:31:52,254 --> 02:31:54,014
Not for free.
70-30.

2272
02:31:54,614 --> 02:31:56,854
If you feel bad about it,
let it be 30-70.

2273
02:31:56,928 --> 02:31:59,448
Hey! You'll be pleading
for a murder case next.

2274
02:31:59,569 --> 02:32:00,769
I will be the culprit.

2275
02:32:00,927 --> 02:32:02,087
Whom are you going to kill, dad?

2276
02:32:02,112 --> 02:32:03,752
I'll tell you that
after killing you.

2277
02:32:05,044 --> 02:32:06,644
Did you really mean that?
- Yes.

2278
02:32:06,669 --> 02:32:08,269
I will hit you on
your head with a rod.

2279
02:32:09,574 --> 02:32:10,694
I left that job.

2280
02:32:10,734 --> 02:32:12,134
Now I am his clerk.

2281
02:32:13,014 --> 02:32:14,494
Congratulations, Balakrishnan.

2282
02:32:14,519 --> 02:32:16,679
Thank you.
- I am Balan's father.

2283
02:32:17,214 --> 02:32:18,974
Bro will take up all
the troublesome cases.

2284
02:32:19,214 --> 02:32:21,494
Don't let this brother in law join you!

2285
02:32:22,744 --> 02:32:23,944
What did she say?

2286
02:32:23,969 --> 02:32:26,009
To make you the DGP.
- This is my right.

2287
02:32:26,034 --> 02:32:28,274
To get me arrested, right?
- Move! I have to go!

2288
02:32:30,216 --> 02:32:33,136
This v... victory belongs to you!
