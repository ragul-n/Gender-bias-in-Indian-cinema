1
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,774
- What does man love the most?
- Wealth.

2
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:04,846
- No.
- Fame.

3
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:06,851
- No.
- Himself.

4
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:09,412
- No.
- What else?

5
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,150
His progeny. Man can do just about
anything for the love of a child.

6
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:19,890
Man can go to any extent
for the sake of his son.

7
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:38,683
Lord Shiva seems to be
pleased with you, Shamsher Singh.

8
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:42,217
Your son has become
an lnspector of Police.

9
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:47,826
And your son's wife is going to
bear a beautiful child very soon.

10
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:51,625
lt's truly a result
of your good deeds...

11
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:54,926
... the fruits of your labours.

12
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:01,908
You have moulded us out of clay,
O'Lord. And we are your servants.

13
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,245
You are the Lord who
presides over our fate.

14
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:31,699
- Hey there, Mr.Gurbax...
- What's it now?

15
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,973
l'm about to become
a grandfather. A grandpa!

16
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:38,274
- Oh yes. l know that.
- And, my son is an lnspector!

17
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:42,748
- l know.
- Wonder what my grandson will make.

18
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:47,309
lt happens as God wishes it to.
lt's all fated.

19
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,652
Fate is nothing. lt's all
the result of one's work.

20
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:56,818
- lt's all fated, my dear.
- Just hard work and planning.

21
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,226
- Foresight is it!
- Fate it is.

22
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,225
- Foresight.
- Fate.

23
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,395
Foresight!

24
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:05,579
Fate!

25
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:29,795
Why mustn't you take care
of your son's father too?

26
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,935
The son is due in 3 months. l have
to wear shirts-sans-buttons, already!

27
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,834
You should get used
to the domestic chores too.

28
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:41,247
- He'll be a Lord in this house.
- ls that so?

29
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:46,181
- Oh, l'm undone. Mr.lnspector!
- What's up?

30
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:51,981
- Jagavar kidnapped my daughter.
- How long are we to tolerate this?

31
00:07:56,373 --> 00:08:00,491
- Has Jagavar Chowdhary returned?
- He uses this village as a base...

32
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:03,232
-... to run his rackets.
- That's true, Sir.

33
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:07,205
- Where can l find him?
- ln the White House.

34
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:43,572
These foreigners want to buy
the gold and the cocaine.

35
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:47,575
- They also have a liking for women.
- The exchange?

36
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,406
Exchange?... l see,, the price.

37
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:54,582
- They're likely to pay hefty sums.
- Sell them off.

38
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:55,326
No!

39
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,997
lf anyone moves an inch, the
next bullet hits Jagavar Chowdhary.

40
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:11,869
- Who is that?
- The new lnspector.

41
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:17,432
Go on... you can escape
using the rear passage.

42
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:22,280
l'm arresting you, Jagavar,
on the charge of abducting the girls.

43
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:26,848
The fresh blood in your veins boils.
And you're justified too, lnspector.

44
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,116
My foolish lieutenants
haven't fed you.

45
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:39,326
Jail rations are going to be your
lot. And, l'm lnspector Pratap Singh.

46
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:49,507
He seems to have misunderstood me.
Present the ''feed''.

47
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:01,780
Don't pick it up.
Don't take on Jagavar, lnspector.

48
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:51,164
The Police Station
is 50 miles from here.

49
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:56,205
Make sure you run all the way.
And tell them not to even dare...

50
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:59,672
... cross Jagavar's path. Never!

51
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:10,845
What a wondrous instrument,
the binoculars!

52
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,309
Things so far away...

53
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:15,014
... seem to have
come so close.

54
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:18,749
That's just why l've
bought binoculars for my son.

55
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:21,917
Whenever he sees thieves running,
he can use binoculars...

56
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:25,258
... to spot them from afar.
Then, he can go gunning for them.

57
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,459
Four people! Chasing a poor fellow.
Take a look.

58
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,229
Over there.

59
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:40,167
Gurbax! He's my son, Pratap!

60
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:06,933
Let's return.

61
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:18,641
What's happened?
Who were those people?

62
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,055
No, my Son!
You're all of my life.

63
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:41,667
A father has brought his son's
corpse to your police station.

64
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:45,538
He was your lnspector. And you
want to lodge the papers first!

65
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,609
And, in the meantime,
those dogs will have escaped!

66
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,642
But, without the paperwork,
our hands are tied.

67
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,851
Cut off such
useless hands, then!

68
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,031
lt's your hands which are tied.
My hands aren't tied.

69
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:13,662
l'll see the end of it.
l'll see it to the end.

70
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:02,312
No! Shamsher! Don't!
Please forgive me.

71
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,417
Forgive me! Please!
No! Not me!

72
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:07,624
ln the name of Lord Shiva.

73
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,560
May Lord Shiva spare you.

74
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,632
Tell me, who is your boss?

75
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,363
Who killed my son?

76
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:25,733
Tell me.

77
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:28,577
All right! l'll tell you!

78
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:31,810
Shamsher Singh!
Surrender to the Police. Or else...

79
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:07,576
Father! Everything
is finished for me!

80
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:33,005
Hush! Quiet, my child.

81
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,343
Gurbax! Gurbax!

82
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,286
- l'm finished!
- What's the matter?

83
00:17:15,998 --> 00:17:18,614
- Come with me.
- Why? What's happened?

84
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,247
- Look at that.
- Goodness.

85
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,528
Call the midwife. Hurry!

86
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:31,002
Everything'll be all right.

87
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,498
Don't you worry.
- Everything has gone so wrong!

88
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,169
The swine!
They killed my son!

89
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:44,675
They killed my young son!
They got together and killed him!

90
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:49,786
They have made a widow out
of my young daughter-in-law.

91
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,356
The poor girl! Look at her!

92
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,923
Take heart.
And have faith in God.

93
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:58,828
- No!
- Everything'll be all right.

94
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:01,196
His is the doing.
God is responsible for this misery.

95
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:18,039
lt's a son, Gurbax.

96
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:47,242
This is not the
time for weeping.

97
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,340
The infant is very weak.
lt's only 7 months old.

98
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,749
Take him to a hospital immediately.
Else, he might not survive.

99
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,077
Come on.

100
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:08,428
You must live.

101
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:12,100
You won't leave
me alone, my love.

102
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,869
Everyone has cheated me.

103
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,439
But you won't
cheat me, will you?

104
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:24,445
You shall live.

105
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:54,068
- My child is all right, isn't he?
- He isn't well. lt's up to God.

106
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:03,884
The will of God, l know.

107
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:09,551
But, l shall not
let His will be done.

108
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,329
l shall not let
Thy will be done.

109
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:29,039
- Which ward is Shambhu Nath in?
- ln number 13. Follow me.

110
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:32,279
- How did the accident take place?
- Hit by a truck.

111
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,776
How is he doing now?

112
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:41,026
Your son is doing well.
You can take him home.

113
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:53,698
Where are you off to? Pay up
the charges in the first place.

114
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,634
- Pay what?
- The hospital fees.

115
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,371
- How much for the fees?
- How much is it, Sister?

116
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:03,747
- 886 Rupees.
- Eight hundred and eighty-six.

117
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:08,577
- Where'd l get 886 Rupees from?
- How'd you take this child away...

118
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:12,122
-... without paying up?
- Strange words! Can't l have...

119
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:16,918
-... my child unless l pay up?!
- That's right.

120
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:18,188
Out of my way!
lt's my child!

121
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:23,932
He's my blood!
My child!

122
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:29,164
- He says that l can't have him!
- You aren't doing the right thing.

123
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:32,100
Am l committing a crime? Will
you snatch away a poor man's child...

124
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:38,072
... just because he can't
pay your bills? ls that justice?

125
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,776
- Strange!
- Now look here...

126
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,045
Don't you dare touch my child!

127
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:59,996
- Will you please listen to me?
- Excuse me Doctor; he's calling you.

128
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:00,537
Bring him along.

129
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:07,010
Come in. l've been watching
this drama for sometime now.

130
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:10,042
- Strange fellow. And he insists...
- Let him have his child.

131
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:14,881
- How much is the bill?
- 886 Rupees, Sir.

132
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:21,286
Here you are.

133
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:23,753
Put the balance on my account.

134
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:25,125
You may leave.

135
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,738
Do you wish to thank me?

136
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:41,805
l accept your thanks.

137
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:47,414
- Where are you taking the infant?
- l don't quite know, where.

138
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:53,153
You must take good care of
the infant. And good care is costly.

139
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:56,750
Do you have money?

140
00:22:57,973 --> 00:22:59,486
Do you have money?

141
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:09,731
Useless. Those are
useless attributes.

142
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,238
Those might be useful for me.

143
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:20,447
My name is Sir Mizia.
l'm a millionaire from Bombay.

144
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:26,248
And naturally, l have
some shady businesses too.

145
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:29,251
Will you do something for me?

146
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:36,657
For the favour you have done me,
l can give my life if you want it.

147
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:46,973
l have a bullet in my leg.
But it wasn't an enemy who shot me.

148
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,481
My nephews... they shot me.

149
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:54,242
They're sitting in a mansion, 20
miles away, waiting for me to die.

150
00:23:57,233 --> 00:24:00,054
To one corner of
the mansion is a dry well.

151
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:06,030
Under the fifth stone inside
the well, lies a box belonging to me.

152
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:08,763
That's what you
must fetch for me.

153
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:12,703
This is a photograph
of the mansion.

154
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:17,902
Here's what you may
need for protection.

155
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,350
Had your child not been with me,
you would've run away with the box.

156
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,965
886 Rupees that you
had given me yesterday...

157
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:18,667
... is more valuable than
all those gems and diamonds.

158
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:23,107
Well said. Someday,
you'll become a great man.

159
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,633
What shall l ever make, Sir?

160
00:25:29,325 --> 00:25:32,180
l'm an uneducated villager.
What can l make?

161
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,879
Even uneducated villagers had
become Kings in their times.

162
00:25:39,335 --> 00:25:43,556
Millions of educated people become
clerks. And, they die as clerks too.

163
00:25:45,341 --> 00:25:49,596
lf you want to make it big in life,
you must remember something, friend.

164
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:51,895
Be the maker
of your own fate.

165
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:55,601
Carve out a future
for yourself.

166
00:25:56,352 --> 00:26:00,470
God, Religion, Honesty and Fate
are coinage for fools. Forget it all.

167
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:05,271
Start a new life from today.

168
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,747
For this child, you are the God.

169
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:16,858
Keep this... the first gift
in a new life... >From me.

170
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:23,834
Come in tomorrow
morning and see me.

171
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,672
''Be the maker of your own fate''

172
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:36,412
''Carve out a future
for yourself''

173
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:41,544
''You are! You are! You are!''

174
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:44,213
Yes! l am! l am God!

175
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:49,318
Till a day ago,
you were God.

176
00:26:50,472 --> 00:26:52,724
Not today.
Not now. Not anymore.

177
00:26:56,145 --> 00:27:00,070
You've destroyed my life. l swear
by the very breath that this...

178
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:15,714
... innocent infant breathes... You
shall not be the maker of his fate.

179
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:19,685
l shall be the maker of his fate.

180
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,052
l shall be his God.

181
00:27:31,547 --> 00:27:35,597
For the sake of wealth, Shamsher
Singh entered the portals of crime.

182
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:41,407
He toiled day and night, to win the
confidence of his Master, Sir Mizia.

183
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:48,715
And, before he died, Sir Mizia
gave everything to...

184
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,745
... Shamsher Singh...
his wealth and his power.

185
00:27:56,472 --> 00:28:00,294
He carried the orphaned child
with him into the world of crime.

186
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,735
And, he was it's father as well
as it's mother... And, one day...

187
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:10,136
We shall get to know of the person
who controls the smuggling network...

188
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:12,909
... if we can apprehend
car # GDR 1537. Follow the car.

189
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:51,641
- My child! Kunal!
- Why do you drive carelessly?

190
00:28:53,996 --> 00:28:57,989
You're lucky that l was praying.
Else, he would've be dead by now.

191
00:28:57,533 --> 00:29:00,548
How so, my good man?
l've taken pains enough...

192
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,794
... to snatch him back
from God. Hush, child.

193
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:08,929
- Does it have a mother?
- lt has no one else but me.

194
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:14,434
Give me the child... Poor Devil...
You can't even hold a child.

195
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,106
There! See how he fell silent?

196
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:28,778
He has fallen silent indeed.
Thank you very much.

197
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:34,559
You can thank me later. As of now,
you should tend to your wounds.

198
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:37,219
Come with me to my shanty.
lt's right over there.

199
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,299
My modest home shows off
my regal status!

200
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:51,533
l enjoy every bit
of nature's bounties.

201
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,568
You haven't told me
what your name is.

202
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:58,179
Abu... people call me ''Abu Baba''.

203
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:04,054
- What is your calling?
- Nowadays, all l do is to pray.

204
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:10,527
- And what did you do before ''now''?
- l used to be a constable.

205
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:18,467
And a strict one l was. The whole
town knew about the constable.

206
00:30:21,617 --> 00:30:25,439
Have you heard of ''Shaka'',
the hooligan? He was a hefty sort.

207
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:30,643
He had beaten up a kid badly.
The victim's eye had popped out.

208
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:37,544
And, what else could there have
been, but my stick on Shaka's head!

209
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:42,721
The blow must've been a strong one,
for it felled Shaka dead.

210
00:30:43,238 --> 00:30:46,696
The government threw me
out of the job... Well, so what?

211
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:51,969
But l just can't bear to see
torture. And l hate dishonest people.

212
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,574
Are you single, Abu?
Or do you have children?

213
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,412
Oh yes. l was married.
And l, had a child too.

214
00:31:02,658 --> 00:31:06,810
The wife died in childbirth. And,
my child was washed away in a flood.

215
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:21,360
Such was the wish of God. The only
one l had lived for, was taken away.

216
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:26,597
l was praying for the souls of
my departed wife and child...

217
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,765
... when the Lord put this
beautiful child into my hands.

218
00:31:35,557 --> 00:31:38,173
Sit down, Mister.
Please do not bother.

219
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:41,708
Oh no! He has wet his pants.

220
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:45,519
Now don't cry. Good boy.

221
00:31:51,807 --> 00:31:54,355
Did anyone hit you?
Who hit you, dear?

222
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:00,601
Do you see that?
He has quietened.

223
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:07,735
Come to think of it, Sir, you
haven't said anything about yourself.

224
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,607
Tell you what...
your story and mine are similar.

225
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:20,884
lf you don't mind it,
may l tell you something...?

226
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:27,458
l have everything... money...
wealth... everything.

227
00:32:31,146 --> 00:32:35,367
But, l have no one to take care of
this child. lf only an honest man...

228
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:44,476
... like you could accept the
responsibility of this child...

229
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,410
... l shall consider
it my good fortune.

230
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:50,187
That is but what Allah
has commanded me to do.

231
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:55,624
The Lord's wish shall be fulfilled
if l take care of this child.

232
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:58,359
From this day onwards, Abu Baba...

233
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:04,093
... you are a Father to this child.
And, you are a Mother to him too.

234
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:32,587
These gentlemen, who by light of
the day appear to be businessmen...

235
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:39,870
... are smugglers and hoarders;
they run illicit business under...

236
00:33:38,914 --> 00:33:42,907
... cover of darkness. They cheat
the government. The MlZlA group!

237
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:49,071
l can give you all the names and
l can describe their network to you.

238
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:52,441
- What about a 10oº%  commission?
- Done.

239
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,682
Danny is my son-in-law.
He can never do such a thing!

240
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,254
Danny has gone over
to the Police, Mr.Chiang.

241
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,991
Please forgive him, Sir.
l have only one daughter.

242
00:34:07,843 --> 00:34:11,062
She will be widowed.
Please consider her case, Sir.

243
00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:15,167
Relationship and sentiments are not
points for consideration, Mr.Chiang.

244
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:19,670
You know well that
our businesses are illegitimate.

245
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:24,314
And persons who pose a threat
to us, must be executed...

246
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:29,044
... at the earliest.
Else, they might destroy us.

247
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:34,390
l beg for the life
of my son-in-law.

248
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:38,185
What principle of business
provokes you to suggest that...

249
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:43,857
... the lives of many be put
at stake for the sake of one?

250
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:49,032
According to the principles
of the MlZlA Group,...

251
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:52,105
... Danny must be
executed within 24 hours.

252
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:23,403
You're late for school, Master Kunal
Hurry up. Drink your milk.

253
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:25,706
No! l won't go
to school! l won't!

254
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,971
- Won't you go to school?
- No! l won't!

255
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:30,009
- You must go to school.
- No! l won't go to school.

256
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:32,280
- l won't go to school!
- Oh dear!

257
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,777
l heard that you'd fallen
down and hurt yourself.

258
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:37,212
- l won't go to school, Grandpa.
- Why won't you?

259
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:40,417
Good boys always go to school.
You should also go to school.

260
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:42,151
- l want a hundred rupees for that.
- Not at all!

261
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:46,493
He won't give you a penny.
This imp is going wayward!

262
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,790
Get down. At once!
And, go to school!

263
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,233
Now, you've angered him.

264
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:58,839
lf l give you a hundred rupees,
he will be very angry.

265
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:02,569
lf he gets angry,
there'll be trouble.

266
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:06,008
You'll get in trouble and
l'll get in trouble too.

267
00:36:05,393 --> 00:36:07,850
Off to school, now.
Like a good boy.

268
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:14,647
Why not give him
another two hundred?

269
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:17,589
That'd pay his
way to a cabaret.

270
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:22,330
- Oh, Abu Baba...
- You aren't cheating Abu Baba, Sir.

271
00:36:21,977 --> 00:36:23,831
You're cheating yourself.

272
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:28,137
One of these days, you and l
are going to have a fight over this.

273
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,202
No. Please don't
fight over this.

274
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:31,498
l had only one son.
And he's no more.

275
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:33,409
This child is
the only heir l have.

276
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:35,611
And sometimes,
l am weak to a fault.

277
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:38,845
But, why are you helping
him to inculcate a weakness?

278
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:44,113
lf this goes on, the mansion that
you have built so painstakingly,...

279
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:50,358
... will be no more than
a mound of clay in his hands.

280
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:52,386
Love and affection for
a child l can concede to.

281
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:55,024
- But that doesn't mean...
- Your lecture has been heard...

282
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:57,934
... 50 times over. And it's likely
to be repeated 500 times more!

283
00:36:56,411 --> 00:37:00,131
- His 5th birthday is...
- The day after tomorrow. l know it.

284
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:02,430
- The arrangements...
- Have been done!

285
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:17,644
l'm the truck-driver.
My truck has been nabbed.

286
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,022
The cops are chasing me.
l have a wife and kids, Sir.

287
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:24,494
They're coming!
Please save me, Sir!

288
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:25,987
Please save me, Sir!

289
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:32,431
Our truck was apprehended. And, the
driver has been jailed for 14 years.

290
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:37,207
The driver has proven his loyalty
by not revealing our identities.

291
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:42,446
We should pay his wife and child
a monthly stipend of 1500 Rupees.

292
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:50,384
No, Parvati.
You don't know them.

293
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:57,917
My silence is a must if l am to
save your lives,, you and my daughter.

294
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:06,093
l shall beg of them
to spare my husband's life.

295
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,677
Kunal my boy!
Happy birthday to you.

296
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:20,016
- May you live a 1000 years.
- At the rate of 50,000 days a year!

297
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:25,350
Old hat and not funny enough.
Let's have something new, Uncle.

298
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:29,255
Double congratulations
on Kunal's birthday.

299
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:29,856
Why ''double''?

300
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:33,359
A new company bearing
Kunal's name has been floated!

301
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,130
Kunal Chemical lndustries.

302
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,632
What are you going on
stirring the broth for so long?

303
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:41,237
Just increase the flame on
the burner... Yes. Some more.

304
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:43,107
Sacrilege! Get out of here!

305
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,838
Come on, my boy...
Take a sip of sherbet.

306
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:48,906
- lt's whisky!
- So what if it's whisky?!

307
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,114
You've a tiger cub.
No less. Go on. Drink it.

308
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,349
- Do you remember the driver
who was jailed? - Yes.

309
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:01,951
His wife is waiting at the gates.
She wants to speak to you.

310
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:07,996
Please ask KK to meet the woman
and take care of what she wants.

311
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:10,232
- Address her with respect.
- Very well, Sir.

312
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:15,195
For the sake of my child,
please have my husband released!

313
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:19,032
But, you are receiving
a monthly compensation, aren't you?

314
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:21,771
Please don't weigh my husband's
company with money's worth.

315
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:24,614
lt's the Boss' grandson's birthday.
Talk too much and...

316
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:28,478
... l'll make mincemeat out of you.
Throw her out, watchman.

317
00:39:28,363 --> 00:39:30,877
Oh yes! Throw me out!
But, be warned!

318
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,522
l won't let you live in peace.
l won't spare you and your boss.

319
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,897
- Waiter.
- Yes, Sir?

320
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:49,266
- Come here... Some more whisky.
- No more, please.

321
00:39:48,983 --> 00:39:51,702
lf the Boss sees me,
he'll skin me alive.

322
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:53,701
- l'm a poor man, Sir.
- lf you're a poor man...

323
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:55,939
... you should rather walk
the streets and beg for a living.

324
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:58,181
Whisky!

325
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:12,224
Have you taken alcohol?

326
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,170
Yes.

327
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:16,729
Have you consumed alcohol?
Yes. l've drunk.

328
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:30,831
l'm sad today, Sir.

329
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,908
Kunal was drunk with heady
spirits and the power of wealth.

330
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:43,810
The slap on the face of
the servant is a slap on my face.

331
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:49,918
- Had l not told you?
- You were right.

332
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:55,255
The child spoilt by my love
and wealth can only go astray.

333
00:42:01,683 --> 00:42:05,904
Gold can't be crafted into jewellery
unless it has been melted in fire.

334
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:12,077
A foot planted firmly on soil
can help one maintain a balance.

335
00:42:13,328 --> 00:42:16,980
You're right. And as l see it,
there's only one way out now.

336
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:23,884
You must take Kunal away from me.
... away from my wealth.

337
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,992
You must educate him and
inculcate a sense of values in him.

338
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:34,565
You must teach him what
is right and what is wrong.

339
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:38,103
And bring him back only after
he has become a complete person.

340
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:40,744
Can you live without Kunal?

341
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:45,439
Yes, l shall live on. For he goes
out of sight. Not out of my heart.

342
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:55,223
For the sake of my son,
l shall endure this alienation.

343
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:59,321
Very well. From this day onwards,
Kunal is Abu's son.A poor man's son.

344
00:43:03,378 --> 00:43:05,528
l shall bring him up as my own.

345
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:09,601
l shall instil in him the sense
of honesty, truth and courage.

346
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:13,536
After he has become a complete man,
l shall bring him into this house.

347
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:16,240
So promises an honest
and upright Muslin.

348
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:22,409
l pray that God lets me live till
l have accomplished my objective.

349
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:32,118
- What is it?
- l won't go to school.

350
00:43:32,573 --> 00:43:35,087
- Why?
- l want to go back to Bombay.

351
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:37,401
l want to go to Grandpa.
l don't like it here.

352
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:41,166
Come here. Let me tell
you the real story.

353
00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:50,069
You aren't Grandpa's grandson.
And he isn't your Grandpa.

354
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:57,250
He doesn't have a child of his own.
Where'd he find a grandson?

355
00:43:58,433 --> 00:44:00,981
You're my son.
That's the truth of it.

356
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:11,594
He sent his grandson away
for the sake of his son.

357
00:44:12,447 --> 00:44:16,304
While his grandson was being
reared into a man of principles,...

358
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:21,001
... Shamsher Singh went on
unscrupulously to amass wealth.

359
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:23,471
On the other hand...

360
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:29,948
- Will you forsake honest labour?
- Never.

361
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:32,880
- Will you fear the dishonest?
- Never!

362
00:44:32,633 --> 00:44:33,884
Get up, then.

363
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,855
Yes, Sir.
l'm Jagavar Chowdhary.

364
00:45:11,906 --> 00:45:15,626
l have been trying for long
to meet you. And finally, l have.

365
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:18,934
lf you have,
then you may sit down.

366
00:45:18,713 --> 00:45:19,828
Thank you.

367
00:45:20,181 --> 00:45:24,038
l have tried to contact you
several times over the phone. But...

368
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,865
- Jagavar Chowdhary... aren't you?
- Yes. l am.

369
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:31,439
- Are you KK's friend?
- Yes.

370
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:36,520
He has been telling me about you.
l understand that you want to...

371
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:40,149
... buy a ship belonging
to the Kunal Shipping Corporation.

372
00:45:40,535 --> 00:45:44,460
Yes. At any price. lt'd make a
significant impact on my business.

373
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:49,329
lt'd make a significant
impact on my heart to sell it.

374
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:50,533
How so?

375
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:54,403
l can't bear to part with
anything that's attached to...

376
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:58,365
... the name Kunal...
that's my grandson's name.

377
00:46:00,655 --> 00:46:03,670
And, l always buy whatever
l've set my mind on.

378
00:46:10,064 --> 00:46:13,056
Those that fly by air
are likely to be jolted.

379
00:46:16,003 --> 00:46:19,757
- You haven't answered my question.
- You see, Mr.Chowdhary...

380
00:46:20,942 --> 00:46:23,934
l'm going to see
my grandson after many years.

381
00:46:25,046 --> 00:46:26,866
And, l'm in a good mood.

382
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:31,097
l'd request you
not to spoil my mood.

383
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:39,606
- Where does your grandson live?
- ln my heart.

384
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:44,915
And your son?

385
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:57,157
Strong turbulence, Mr.Chowdhary.
l think it'd be better...

386
00:46:57,478 --> 00:47:00,629
... if you went back to
your seat and safety belt.

387
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:02,162
All for the better.

388
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:09,442
- Did it work out?
- For the time-being,...

389
00:47:09,624 --> 00:47:12,377
... you must go into
hiding outside lndia.

390
00:47:12,627 --> 00:47:14,618
l'll take care of the rest.

391
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:20,422
Nice meeting you.

392
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:23,789
- Thank you.
- See you.

393
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:27,422
- Which way are you headed?
- 30 miles from here.

394
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:31,999
l'm headed the same way.
Why don't we travel together?

395
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:35,064
l'd be fortunate to spend
some more time with you.

396
00:47:36,651 --> 00:47:39,643
- Please come with me.
- ls the red car yours?

397
00:47:38,653 --> 00:47:41,577
- Consider it your own, Sir.
- Let's proceed.

398
00:47:42,657 --> 00:47:43,669
Come on.

399
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:03,425
Take a look at this!
''Seven of a family murdered in Pune''

400
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,693
''Murderers still at large''

401
00:48:07,882 --> 00:48:09,600
l had masterminded it.

402
00:48:11,686 --> 00:48:15,736
This news about this death of
a prominent smuggler in a car crash...

403
00:48:22,697 --> 00:48:25,245
And you must've
masterminded that too.

404
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,419
- You're quick on the uptake.
- l try to.

405
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:34,129
- l'd like you for a friend.
- What if l were an enemy?

406
00:48:36,711 --> 00:48:40,636
ln that case, you'd be sitting
in your car... the one which is...

407
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:44,635
... following us... and l'd
be sitting here, as l am... and...

408
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,541
... a decision regarding your
life would've taken a moment ago.

409
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:49,709
How would that have been?

410
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:54,581
l would've pressed
this button... like that.

411
00:49:03,471 --> 00:49:05,325
Does that make you laugh?

412
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:06,369
Yes.

413
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:09,899
That wasn't my car.
You've bombed a wrong car.

414
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:13,566
- What?!
- That's true.

415
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:17,170
You've blown up an innocent.
My car is behind us now.

416
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:24,403
Say what Mr.Chowdhary... why
don't we stop by the road...

417
00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:28,877
... for a drink of coconut water?
lt'd cool us and freshen our minds.

418
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:35,088
Please stop beside
the fellow selling green coconuts.

419
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:54,235
Your death was lurking nearby too.
You've just escaped certain death.

420
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:59,047
- Meaning?
- Meaning that l've granted you...

421
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:05,345
... a chance to live, despite
that cheap trick you pulled.

422
00:50:07,802 --> 00:50:10,316
That reeks of
antagonism, Mr.Sobhraj.

423
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:19,166
Not antagonism. That's
the fragrance of my friendship.

424
00:50:20,014 --> 00:50:23,438
l've dragged you out of
the confines of your red car...

425
00:50:23,617 --> 00:50:26,871
... in which you would've
been sitting, right now...

426
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:28,867
... next to my walking stick
in which a fuse lies primed.

427
00:50:28,823 --> 00:50:32,839
l would've pressed a small button
in here and you'd go up in smoke.

428
00:50:35,629 --> 00:50:37,381
- How so?
- Like that.

429
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:48,491
lf you want to make it big,
you mustn't make small mistakes.

430
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:10,312
Whoever advised you to
step upon a sleeping snake?

431
00:51:10,865 --> 00:51:15,120
You're an old friend. You should've
asked me. l would've introduced you.

432
00:51:18,873 --> 00:51:22,388
- He's the capo di tutti capi.
- l know him from times...

433
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:25,801
-... when he was a nobody.
- Really? Tell us.

434
00:51:25,146 --> 00:51:26,295
Never mind.

435
00:51:27,114 --> 00:51:31,130
Don't mind my saying so. But
friendship and business are different.

436
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:37,108
As the saying goes, you mustn't try
to step into shoes too big for you.

437
00:51:39,894 --> 00:51:42,442
You're a small-time
smuggler from Goa.

438
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:45,981
We of the MlZlA, wear shoes
several times larger than yours.

439
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,155
Anyway, l'll introduce you... l'll
take you to his grandson's reception.

440
00:52:07,922 --> 00:52:11,540
Look at these... look at these
prizes l have won at school.

441
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:20,981
That's for honesty and
helping nab the cheaters.

442
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,157
Who are you?

443
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:30,095
Don't you recognise him?

444
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,931
Try and remember...
look at him closely.

445
00:52:38,986 --> 00:52:41,978
Don't you recognise him?...
He's your grandpa.

446
00:52:44,124 --> 00:52:45,637
- Grandpa?
- Yes.

447
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:48,576
You're his grandson.

448
00:52:50,965 --> 00:52:52,182
And you...?!

449
00:52:53,968 --> 00:52:55,481
You aren't my son.

450
00:53:02,977 --> 00:53:03,739
No!

451
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:11,032
No! Abu Baba! l don't want
to go away with anyone!

452
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:14,233
- You're everything for me!
- My son!

453
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:17,643
l want to stay with you, Abu Baba.

454
00:53:21,061 --> 00:53:22,414
Don't cry, Son.

455
00:53:25,432 --> 00:53:29,448
l'm merely a tutor who has taught
you truth, honesty and sacrifice.

456
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:35,864
Your grandpa has sacrificed
14 long years for your sake.

457
00:53:41,181 --> 00:53:44,901
But, l remember not a day in
these 14 years when he failed...

458
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:49,538
... to ask me about you.
He has held you close to his heart.

459
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:55,143
Embrace him and you will hear your
name in his heart. Go to him, Son.

460
00:54:10,377 --> 00:54:13,801
ln sending me away with Abu Baba,
you've been God-like.

461
00:55:03,897 --> 00:55:05,410
What's the matter?

462
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:10,585
- Do you see that fat
fellow sitting there? - Yes.

463
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:15,930
He's my friend from times
when l used to be a poor man.

464
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:16,898
Gurbax! lt's him!

465
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:11,677
- You!
- And you!

466
00:56:17,171 --> 00:56:21,426
-You're turned out like a gentleman!
- Of course! But don't ask ''how''!

467
00:56:23,177 --> 00:56:25,099
How have you been, Gurbax?

468
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:29,998
After you left, l lost my job.
And no one would...

469
00:56:29,616 --> 00:56:33,871
... give me his daughter to me in
marriage. So,l've remained a bachelor.

470
00:56:31,385 --> 00:56:35,537
l bought up a few trucks. And the
boys over there work in my business.

471
00:56:35,189 --> 00:56:38,044
- What about you?
- l can't believe my eyes!

472
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:44,980
Come with me.
l must show you something.

473
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:49,658
- Do you recognise him?
- Who is he?

474
00:56:49,203 --> 00:56:50,454
Remember him?

475
00:56:51,205 --> 00:56:55,221
He's the one l warned by the fire
of your engine after he was born.

476
00:56:57,344 --> 00:56:59,392
- ls he Pratap's son?
- Yes.

477
00:57:00,414 --> 00:57:02,268
- Your grandson?!
- Yes!

478
00:57:02,816 --> 00:57:05,467
What are you staring at?
Touch his feet.

479
00:57:05,552 --> 00:57:07,065
May you live long!

480
00:57:06,987 --> 00:57:09,501
Go on everybody!
Go and have a drink.

481
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,013
May you live long!
God is merciful!

482
00:57:15,229 --> 00:57:16,685
He's grown up so!

483
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:21,088
Your grandpa and l used to be
bosom pals through thick and thin.

484
00:57:20,434 --> 00:57:23,426
Witness the miracle of God!
May you live long!

485
00:57:23,937 --> 00:57:28,055
- You've worked a miracle, Shamsher!
- l haven't worked any miracles.

486
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,333
lt's all the handiwork
of his tutor, Abu Baba.

487
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:34,733
l share no more than
the bloodlines with my grandson.

488
00:57:34,515 --> 00:57:38,736
The friendship between you belies
the distinctions of class and wealth.

489
00:57:37,618 --> 00:57:38,607
Oh yes!

490
00:57:39,253 --> 00:57:41,005
Come to Bombay with me.

491
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:44,873
No! l must be going elsewhere
just now. l'll see you later.

492
00:57:45,325 --> 00:57:48,317
We're throwing a party
to welcome my grandson.

493
00:57:48,428 --> 00:57:51,784
Catch me missing a party
like that! l'll come. Surely.

494
00:57:52,165 --> 00:57:56,317
l'll come all decked up for the
occasion. And l'll carry my booze too.

495
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:56,347
We'll celebrate it. We will!

496
00:58:02,776 --> 00:58:05,825
You seem to be doing
well at business, Shamsher.

497
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:09,203
Not Shamsher. l'm Sobhraj.

498
00:58:10,284 --> 00:58:13,799
That's fine. But tell me...
how have you made it so rich?

499
00:58:14,688 --> 00:58:17,703
l'll explain everything later.
But, just now...

500
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:21,113
... l must take care of the guests
who are attending the party.

501
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:26,016
l don't like
all this, Abu Baba.

502
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:28,847
You must accept your
God-gifted status happily.

503
00:58:32,673 --> 00:58:34,789
These people
look like fakes.

504
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:39,062
You mustn't say things like that.
And you must greet everyone properly.

505
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:42,965
You must do as l have told you.
Don't you bring me to shame.

506
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:43,565
Go on, now.

507
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:50,806
- Come over here, Kunal.
- Yes, Grandpa?

508
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:53,848
Meet Mr.Sharma. He's
the General Manager in our company.

509
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,118
All the best, Mr.Kunal.
And it seems that it has been...

510
00:58:55,762 --> 00:58:59,220
... your Grandpa who has
designed your destiny. Not God.

511
00:58:58,465 --> 00:59:01,582
- Do you hear that Gurbax?
- That's fine. But...!

512
00:59:04,438 --> 00:59:06,486
How did you make it so rich?!

513
00:59:08,408 --> 00:59:11,730
- Step aside. l'll tell you.
- Why? What's ''aside''?

514
00:59:13,213 --> 00:59:17,331
There's a party going on in here.
Shut up! You'll ruin my reputation.

515
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:20,537
- Shut up!
- How did you make it so rich?

516
00:59:23,957 --> 00:59:26,949
He's my friend KK Singh.
He's also my partner.

517
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:30,019
- Do you recognise him?
- You've grown up now.

518
00:59:29,429 --> 00:59:33,081
But l still remember the pranks
you used to pull as a child.

519
00:59:32,165 --> 00:59:34,019
The Commissioner, Mr.Roy.

520
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:38,620
He's Shamsher Singh's grandson.

521
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,234
This is Mr.Jagavar Chowdhary.
He owes the Jaycee Company.

522
01:00:08,535 --> 01:00:11,459
Your grandson has
hands of steel, Mr.Sobhraj.

523
01:00:13,674 --> 01:00:15,790
His hand is sweating, Grandpa.

524
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:21,002
You must've touched
a nerve, my boy.

525
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:25,339
Take this. Wipe the sweat.

526
01:00:30,424 --> 01:00:33,279
Tell me... how did
my friend strike it rich?

527
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:39,348
Simple. lt's hard work
and God overhead.

528
01:00:42,436 --> 01:00:45,189
l know his ''God'' well.
That couldn't be!

529
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,598
Hey! What's going on?!

530
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:03,839
You dance very well, Durga.

531
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:06,873
Do you take me
for a dancing girl?

532
01:02:06,987 --> 01:02:10,980
Take care of your goons, Peter.
Else, l'll make mincemeat of them.

533
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:15,550
They wanted me to dance for the
festival. That's why l'm dancing.

534
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:21,753
l'm your cousin. And l've asked
you not to waste yourself here.

535
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:31,262
Who can appreciate your
art in these slums?

536
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:33,395
Which is why l want
you to join my band.

537
01:02:35,782 --> 01:02:38,330
You can sing and
dance at good hotels.

538
01:02:40,554 --> 01:02:43,808
Pervert! Do you want your
cousin to dance at hotels?

539
01:02:44,558 --> 01:02:47,914
- lt pays well, too.
- Do you take me for a courtesan?

540
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:50,648
You're no less

541
01:02:55,235 --> 01:02:58,090
Bloody bastards!
What do you take Durga for?

542
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,701
Men fight with fists.
Not knives.

543
01:03:14,588 --> 01:03:17,512
Why do you touch my men?
Fight me if you can.

544
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,351
lf you're your father's son,
hold your ground.

545
01:03:24,598 --> 01:03:26,316
l'll show you! l will!

546
01:03:39,613 --> 01:03:42,605
l don't fight the old,
the weak and the drunk.

547
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:48,901
l'll come here at
1 1 in the morning. Tomorrow.

548
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,811
You can tell
your musclemen that.

549
01:03:56,429 --> 01:03:59,853
The black sun that shines
over the dark world of crime.

550
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:01,815
Are you the chairman
of the MlZlA gang?

551
01:04:03,637 --> 01:04:05,355
Yes. l'm the chairman.

552
01:04:08,975 --> 01:04:11,432
- Don't tell it to the boy.
- Oh no!

553
01:04:11,745 --> 01:04:14,259
You don't know
what Kunal is made of.

554
01:04:15,982 --> 01:04:17,495
l love you, Kunal.

555
01:04:20,053 --> 01:04:22,169
He has taken after his father.

556
01:04:30,664 --> 01:04:33,178
Mother! You must
ask Peter to desist.

557
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:35,715
Else, he's going to get
bashed up badly someday.

558
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:37,758
He created a scene today
in a drunken stupor.

559
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:40,228
What am l to do with him?
lt would've been manageable...

560
01:04:39,673 --> 01:04:43,131
... had my sister been alive.
Ever since he was a kid...

561
01:04:41,574 --> 01:04:45,726
... he has been hooked to his dream
of becoming an Englishman someday.

562
01:04:43,843 --> 01:04:46,960
Soldiers! Do you know why
the English made drums?

563
01:04:48,915 --> 01:04:52,908
So that the drumbeat could put
a man's blood on boil... and erupt.

564
01:04:58,959 --> 01:05:01,473
Prepare my bloodies!
For a sacrifice!

565
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:12,220
lt's 1 1 o'clock.
And he isn't here yet.

566
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:16,195
Death to anyone who
challenges John. He won't come by.

567
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,178
What's that?! A motorcycle?!
Or, as it a flying carpet?!

568
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,424
Abu Baba asks me not
to fight without reason.

569
01:05:44,738 --> 01:05:47,889
And once l have reason enough,
l mustn't back out.

570
01:05:50,076 --> 01:05:52,931
l'm standing before you,
Peter John D'Costa.

571
01:05:54,547 --> 01:05:58,199
l won't confront you, because
l'm an Englishman from London.

572
01:05:59,919 --> 01:06:04,140
l don't fight... l get people to.
l get things done, and people bashed.

573
01:06:49,969 --> 01:06:52,085
Why are you ganging up on him?

574
01:06:52,472 --> 01:06:55,589
One man at a time!
He'll bash up everyone of you!

575
01:06:55,575 --> 01:06:58,191
- See how he's bashed up.
- That's how!

576
01:07:28,842 --> 01:07:29,774
Fools!

577
01:07:30,844 --> 01:07:32,061
The trucker!

578
01:07:32,412 --> 01:07:34,425
You're ganging up on my boy!

579
01:07:36,182 --> 01:07:38,730
You Englishman!
Do you know who he is?

580
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:42,539
A rich man's son who tries
to challenge poor people.

581
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:46,306
He's no ''rich-man's-son''.
He's my friend's son.

582
01:07:46,759 --> 01:07:48,875
Just like anyone of you or me.

583
01:07:48,995 --> 01:07:52,214
- One of us... is he?
- Yes. He's broadhearted too.

584
01:07:53,867 --> 01:07:57,189
He loves poor people.
Which is why he leaves,,

585
01:07:55,969 --> 01:07:59,894
... his palatial home to come to
you. And the fools that you are!

586
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:03,156
Must you resort to hooliganism
on a festival day?

587
01:08:04,878 --> 01:08:07,130
- They're my children.
- Oh yes!

588
01:08:07,046 --> 01:08:08,866
Go on. Apologise to him.

589
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:14,934
Why haven't you attended
our festival this time?

590
01:08:17,757 --> 01:08:20,510
And we're missing your
favourite song too.

591
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:23,275
- My song?
- The one you had sung the last time.

592
01:08:25,598 --> 01:08:27,213
How about it, Durga?

593
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,221
What brings you here, alone?

594
01:16:59,245 --> 01:17:01,236
l've come here to meet you.

595
01:17:01,213 --> 01:17:03,636
And l've come here
to meet you too.

596
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,763
But... over here?!

597
01:17:12,024 --> 01:17:15,039
Whom are you scared of?
- l'm scared of myself.

598
01:17:15,227 --> 01:17:16,876
Why?
- l don't know.

599
01:17:18,197 --> 01:17:19,846
But, l know.
- What?

600
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:23,090
That we are attracted
to each other.

601
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:26,786
ls that something to laugh at?

602
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:30,420
l like the girl in this photograph.
Do you like her?

603
01:18:31,303 --> 01:18:33,225
She looks too westernised.

604
01:18:34,507 --> 01:18:38,500
l'd like a simple Hindustani bride
for Kunal. Take a look at this.

605
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:40,567
Such a big house!
Whose house is it?

606
01:18:41,313 --> 01:18:43,326
Sit here. l'll be back soon.

607
01:18:43,516 --> 01:18:44,938
So many bananas!

608
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:47,175
- May l eat some?
- Go on.

609
01:18:48,988 --> 01:18:50,034
lt's fun!

610
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,318
She looks too frail.
- Grandpa!

611
01:19:04,003 --> 01:19:07,860
We're trying to choose a bride
for you. Take a look. And choose.

612
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:13,265
But... l've already chosen
a girl for myself, Grandpa.

613
01:19:17,817 --> 01:19:20,331
She's sitting in
the hall downstairs.

614
01:19:29,562 --> 01:19:30,915
Got you scared!

615
01:19:32,364 --> 01:19:34,480
- Who are you?
- Your mother!

616
01:19:34,567 --> 01:19:37,718
Goodness! Mother!
And you've smashed the crockery!

617
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:40,721
Why are you weeping?
The house hasn't crashed yet.

618
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:41,592
l'll clean it up for you.

619
01:19:44,476 --> 01:19:46,125
He's fallen down too!

620
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:52,973
Now...!

621
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:00,582
What kind of a prank is this?
What's going on?

622
01:20:01,393 --> 01:20:05,443
Rich boys marrying poor girls would
solve all problems. You said it!

623
01:20:09,602 --> 01:20:10,853
Listen to me!

624
01:20:18,611 --> 01:20:20,226
Kunal! Listen to me!

625
01:20:37,529 --> 01:20:38,780
Who was that?

626
01:20:47,773 --> 01:20:49,821
You're... Durga.
Aren't you?

627
01:20:50,643 --> 01:20:53,157
- Who are you?
- l'm called Abu Baba.

628
01:20:53,712 --> 01:20:57,227
- You mean... Kunal's Abu Baba?!
- Yes. Kunal's Abu Baba.

629
01:20:57,816 --> 01:21:01,172
Please forgive me for not
being able to recognise you.

630
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:03,204
- But l did. At first sight.
- How did you do that?

631
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:06,105
Slipping on a banana peel
isn't easily forgotten.

632
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:10,583
Please take some of the
offerings l made to Lord Shiva.

633
01:21:10,896 --> 01:21:12,944
You're a nice girl, my child.

634
01:21:13,065 --> 01:21:16,114
Which is why l've decided
to tell you something.

635
01:21:17,336 --> 01:21:19,486
- What?
- This fellow Kunal...

636
01:21:20,272 --> 01:21:23,594
... is making a fool out of you.
He isn't a good boy.

637
01:21:24,743 --> 01:21:27,997
What a shame! And he
respects you as his own father!

638
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:31,004
He's always singing your praise.
And you're trying to malign him!

639
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,771
Even the Devil couldn't
speak ill of Kunal.

640
01:21:33,686 --> 01:21:35,734
ls that the shape of things?!

641
01:21:36,689 --> 01:21:39,840
ln which case, l must tell
you everything clearly.

642
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:43,741
The Boss has been generous
towards us... Kunal and myself.

643
01:21:44,964 --> 01:21:48,286
l've been a servant in
that household for many years.

644
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:49,618
- And, Kunal is my son.
- What?!

645
01:21:50,502 --> 01:21:53,653
- Yes. And we're poor people.
- Nice to hear that!

646
01:21:57,042 --> 01:22:00,364
Kunal is just one of us!
l knew it! Kunal isn't rich.

647
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:03,762
And, the rich aren't
as broadminded as Kunal is.

648
01:22:04,717 --> 01:22:08,141
But, there's a problem.
Kunal is after the Boss' money.

649
01:22:09,722 --> 01:22:12,441
Not again! l know Kunal
more than you do!

650
01:22:13,726 --> 01:22:16,718
lf he craved after wealth,
he wouldn't have...

651
01:22:15,828 --> 01:22:19,150
... fallen for a poor
slum-dweller like me. Would he?

652
01:22:18,998 --> 01:22:21,649
- Are you sure that he loves you?
- Yes.

653
01:22:24,103 --> 01:22:27,220
- What about you?
- l love him more than my life!

654
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,359
ls that so?

655
01:22:33,645 --> 01:22:36,296
ln that case,
let me have the offerings.

656
01:22:35,247 --> 01:22:36,077
Why?

657
01:22:36,548 --> 01:22:39,870
So that l can tell Kunal
that l approve of the match.

658
01:22:41,754 --> 01:22:43,676
Durga has passed the test.

659
01:22:48,427 --> 01:22:49,883
Who is this girl?

660
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:53,084
She's a rotten girl
living in a rotten slum.

661
01:22:54,767 --> 01:22:57,759
She's our old truck-driver,
Ganpat's daughter.

662
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:00,327
- Ganpat?
- Yes.

663
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:03,654
He was jailed some
13 or 14 years ago.

664
01:23:03,575 --> 01:23:07,500
l understand your agony, Sir.
lt's all because Kunal is so young.

665
01:23:16,388 --> 01:23:18,936
- lsn't that so?
- That's true, Daddy.

666
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:21,182
So he knows all the rotten girls!
Bloody hood!

667
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:24,843
lf you want me to,
l can eliminate her.

668
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:27,961
No.

669
01:23:31,203 --> 01:23:34,821
Please have her mother
called in. l'll speak to her myself.

670
01:23:35,874 --> 01:23:39,492
Understood, Sir. Durga won't
meet your grandson ever again.

671
01:23:44,283 --> 01:23:46,740
She's born of
your employee, Ganpat.

672
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:49,803
She isn't fit to
marry into this family.

673
01:23:49,488 --> 01:23:52,036
l'll take her away
to Goa immediately.

674
01:23:51,824 --> 01:23:55,180
As an elder brother to a sister,
l'd like to help you.

675
01:23:58,831 --> 01:24:02,949
Please accept this money. lt'll
help you find a suitable boy for her.

676
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:07,986
And, you can also buy
a good house for yourself.

677
01:24:07,906 --> 01:24:12,161
You have addressed me as a sister.
You are wealthy and you're respected.

678
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:19,841
But, all l have is pride. Please
don't try to buy my self-respect.

679
01:24:20,652 --> 01:24:23,007
Thank you very much
for the offer.

680
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:24,512
l admire your self-respect.

681
01:24:25,657 --> 01:24:28,876
But, there are some things
that just cannot happen.

682
01:24:30,929 --> 01:24:34,353
A ship leaves for Goa tomorrow.
l'll provide an escort.

683
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,724
Thank you very much, Sir.

684
01:24:44,676 --> 01:24:47,668
Give her the money
as soon as she reaches Goa.

685
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:49,971
- But, he loves me!
- Stop daydreaming, Durga.

686
01:24:51,283 --> 01:24:54,502
Come to terms with
the reality of your sordid life.

687
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:57,742
l won't leave for Goa
before l've met Kunal.

688
01:24:59,558 --> 01:25:02,174
Why have you separated
Durga and Kunal?

689
01:25:03,428 --> 01:25:06,420
l have taken the step
after due consideration.

690
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:15,889
l have cared for Kunal for
1 7 years. l know him inside out.

691
01:25:20,245 --> 01:25:23,863
The fire that you have stoked
will be your undoing someday.

692
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:28,034
You mustn't let that happen.
Please listen to me.

693
01:25:29,154 --> 01:25:31,805
Please don't take
Durga away from Kunal.

694
01:25:31,356 --> 01:25:34,371
How is she to blame?
ls it because she is poor?

695
01:25:36,295 --> 01:25:40,049
l do not object to her poverty.
l have been a poor man myself.

696
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:48,262
After having cared for the child
for 1 7 years, l can't let him...

697
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:55,831
-... be tainted by a wayward girl.
- No, Sir. She isn't a wayward girl.

698
01:25:57,749 --> 01:26:01,173
She is wayward. lt's just
that you don't know about it.

699
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:07,505
Besides, you might've forgotten
the status of this family.

700
01:26:09,394 --> 01:26:12,852
ln such families the lower
classes aren't allowed entry.

701
01:26:15,968 --> 01:26:18,516
lt hurts me to hear
you speak so, Sir.

702
01:26:21,373 --> 01:26:25,127
l realise that you have merely
become rich. No more than that!

703
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:31,531
Your coffers are large.
But you are narrow-minded.

704
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,371
You are exceeding
your limits, Abu Baba.

705
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:43,514
And what you speak of
is below your dignity.

706
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:45,541
Hold it!

707
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:50,457
Hold your tongue.

708
01:26:52,404 --> 01:26:55,055
Conceded that you
have brought up Kunal.

709
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:03,165
Forget not Abu Baba, that Kunal is
my grandson. He carries my bloodline.

710
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:12,138
And l reserve the right
to decide about his life.

711
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:21,583
What about me?
Have l no right over Kunal?

712
01:27:25,437 --> 01:27:27,655
Have my rights
been terminated?

713
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:32,795
And am l no more related
to your grandson?

714
01:27:36,214 --> 01:27:40,332
Old people retire from jobs. You've
retired me out of a relationship!

715
01:27:47,059 --> 01:27:48,276
Hear me out!

716
01:27:51,463 --> 01:27:55,285
Why have you shut the door like
a coward? Well, if you can't...

717
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,517
... look into my eyes,
you can still hear me out.

718
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:06,165
l had forgotten, like a fool,
that a servant is but a hired hand.

719
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:15,440
And that apart, there remains
no further relationship.

720
01:28:17,889 --> 01:28:20,938
You had this fool tied
to you in chains of love.

721
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:25,916
And today, you've chosen
to break the bond.

722
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,751
You've showed up as
you are, in reality.

723
01:28:31,103 --> 01:28:33,526
Will you retire me
from my service?

724
01:28:36,108 --> 01:28:39,032
l retire you from your
status as my employer.

725
01:28:41,113 --> 01:28:44,128
l shall never set my foot
in this house. Never!

726
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:52,105
Listen to something
more before l leave.

727
01:28:53,392 --> 01:28:56,509
You have broken my heart.
But, l won't let you...

728
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:58,381
... break the heart
of that innocent child.

729
01:28:58,864 --> 01:29:02,322
l won't let you destroy
the home that he plans to build.

730
01:29:12,611 --> 01:29:15,660
Strange! You can't find
a person, like Abu Baba!

731
01:29:18,216 --> 01:29:22,232
We've been searching. But we can't
find him. What are we to do now?

732
01:29:20,919 --> 01:29:25,174
My foot! You'll find him right now
praying at a mosque in the graveyard.

733
01:29:26,258 --> 01:29:29,614
- Very well, Sir.
- And make sure that you tell him...

734
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,953
... that, if he can act stubborn,
then others can be stubborn too.

735
01:29:32,397 --> 01:29:35,446
- Very well, Sir.
- Make sure you tell him that.

736
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,252
Listen!... All right...
never mind. Don't tell him anything.

737
01:29:38,603 --> 01:29:41,219
Well, you can tell
him whatever l said.

738
01:29:46,211 --> 01:29:49,430
Durga and her mother have
left their house forever.

739
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:50,728
- Forever?!
- Yes.

740
01:29:51,183 --> 01:29:55,005
- Where have they gone to?
- They've returned to their village.

741
01:29:53,652 --> 01:29:56,268
- When?
- l saw them off an hour ago...

742
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:59,840
... on a ship bound for Goa.
Durga was weeping inconsolably.

743
01:30:00,192 --> 01:30:04,310
Some people were shouting at her,
and were forcing her into the ship.

744
01:30:02,861 --> 01:30:05,182
- Who were they?
- Some ruffians.

745
01:30:05,363 --> 01:30:07,479
Ruffians?... On a ship to Goa?

746
01:30:10,802 --> 01:30:12,793
The boss has called you in.

747
01:30:13,572 --> 01:30:16,325
- Why? What's up?
- lt's something urgent.

748
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:19,723
- l'll go in with you.
- Not necessary. Please stay here.

749
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:20,826
We'll be back soon...
Please follow me.

750
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:43,679
Stop! You can't go in there.

751
01:31:02,287 --> 01:31:03,936
Let go! Let me go in!

752
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:12,385
My child! Let go!

753
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:32,147
You?!

754
01:31:33,318 --> 01:31:35,309
What are you people up to?!

755
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:43,045
The boss' friends are smugglers!
No! My boss isn't a smuggler!

756
01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:11,637
Go outside.

757
01:32:20,632 --> 01:32:24,352
Piglets! You dare raise your
hand against my family's honour!

758
01:32:26,137 --> 01:32:28,492
Dare you try
to tarnish my honour!

759
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,795
l won't spare
a single one of you!

760
01:32:39,417 --> 01:32:41,874
Take your mother
away, Durga. Hurry.

761
01:32:41,786 --> 01:32:44,437
l'll hand these dogs
over to the police.

762
01:32:50,362 --> 01:32:53,581
Turn the ship around.
Head back to the city. Hurry.

763
01:33:09,648 --> 01:33:12,902
We're in a fix.
Abu Baba has locked us in the cabin.

764
01:33:13,151 --> 01:33:17,269
He has gone to warn the cops. He
swore to hand us over to the police.

765
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:22,212
- Abu did that?!
- l understand everything.

766
01:33:22,394 --> 01:33:25,909
Please don't worry. l'm
a good friend you can count upon.

767
01:33:30,835 --> 01:33:33,952
Please don't worry.
l'll take care of everything.

768
01:34:21,086 --> 01:34:24,635
lf he survives, not a single
one of you will remain alive.

769
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:28,608
l'm thinking of the same thing.

770
01:34:30,128 --> 01:34:31,948
Still thinking, are you?

771
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:42,026
Please take care
of Kunal, O'Lord.

772
01:34:55,487 --> 01:34:58,103
No! You can't leave
me alone, Abu Baba.

773
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,481
Come to your senses, child!

774
01:35:58,049 --> 01:36:01,098
l swear by Abu Baba,
not to spare his assassins.

775
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,279
Don't worry.
The operation will cure her.

776
01:36:13,431 --> 01:36:17,788
- How much would the operation cost?
- lt'd cost you around 3-4000 rupees.

777
01:36:18,903 --> 01:36:22,555
Here's what you need for
keeping your mother alive. Keep it.

778
01:36:26,377 --> 01:36:30,495
''lf you try to inform the police
or anyone else, your mother dies.''

779
01:36:32,383 --> 01:36:35,841
''Your lover is responsible
for whatever has happened.''

780
01:36:41,593 --> 01:36:45,848
Don't try to meet me ever again. lf
you do, you're going to be insulted.

781
01:36:50,101 --> 01:36:53,525
- What's going on?
- She won't tell anything to anyone.

782
01:36:53,938 --> 01:36:58,090
All l know is that Abu Baba died
trying to save her from the ruffians.

783
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:04,230
lt's supposed to be a gang
of notorious smugglers.

784
01:37:04,816 --> 01:37:07,933
We know that you are
grieved by Abu Baba's death.

785
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:11,141
But, the truth is that,
we didn't intend to kill him.

786
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:14,638
lt's Abu Baba who is responsible.
He started shooting at all of us.

787
01:37:15,393 --> 01:37:17,850
And he threatened
to book all of us.

788
01:37:20,131 --> 01:37:23,953
You included! lt'd become
extremely necessary to eliminate him.

789
01:37:24,702 --> 01:37:28,524
We had tried to reason it out
with him. But, he wouldn't agree.

790
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:31,188
- He invited his death.
- We would've been dead otherwise.

791
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,528
- True!
- He's right!

792
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:45,168
You are the ones
who killed Abu Baba.

793
01:37:48,459 --> 01:37:51,474
But l'm the one who will
have to pay the price.

794
01:37:53,464 --> 01:37:57,514
Remember that Kunal mustn't get
to know the truth about this murder.

795
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:02,621
Anyone who dares to inform him,
invites my enmity.

796
01:38:10,949 --> 01:38:13,304
lt pains one
to have his own dead.

797
01:38:15,753 --> 01:38:17,300
The fun starts now.

798
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:23,113
- Grandpa is scared of the grandson.
- What if the grandson gets to know?

799
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:28,354
- And, who may dare do such a thing?
- l may.

800
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:30,816
Will you?!

801
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:36,021
l've called up someone
special for the assignment.

802
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,236
lf you marry Kunal after
enticing him, l won't object.

803
01:38:49,053 --> 01:38:51,601
But, l must gain
as you do. Or else...

804
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:56,273
Threats are unnecessary,
Mr.Chowdhary.

805
01:38:56,728 --> 01:38:58,480
Your work will be done.

806
01:39:01,733 --> 01:39:05,055
- She's a fast one.
- l hope Kunal doesn't outdo her.

807
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:11,391
He's pacing about like an angry
lion, looking for assassins.

808
01:39:38,803 --> 01:39:40,521
May l give you a lift?

809
01:39:40,905 --> 01:39:42,918
- What?
- Come. Sit inside.

810
01:39:44,776 --> 01:39:47,199
No, thank you.
l'm used to walking.

811
01:39:47,045 --> 01:39:49,866
There's only one way
to find what you seek.

812
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:53,662
Neelima.

813
01:40:08,866 --> 01:40:12,085
Do you know the people
who were on the ship to Goa?

814
01:40:13,571 --> 01:40:17,189
- They are Tony and Ponchy.
- Can you introduce me to them?

815
01:40:18,242 --> 01:40:22,565
There's no use of meeting these two.
You and l must plan it out together.

816
01:40:22,713 --> 01:40:25,432
l'll introduce you
to all of them, later.

817
01:40:24,949 --> 01:40:29,204
And, some members of this gang are
important personalities in this city.

818
01:40:27,985 --> 01:40:31,443
- What do you mean?
- lt's a powerful gang... the MlZlA.

819
01:40:34,525 --> 01:40:37,676
- The MlZlA gang?
- Want to know everything today?

820
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:45,219
That's a beautiful ring.
ls it a diamond?

821
01:40:45,169 --> 01:40:47,717
Maybe... my grandfather
gave it to me.

822
01:40:47,738 --> 01:40:49,091
Do you like it?

823
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:51,263
You may have it.

824
01:40:54,846 --> 01:40:56,859
- Does it look nice?
- Yes.

825
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,701
- Let's go in and talk.
- Let us.

826
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:02,604
l don't know who the boss is.
But l know the others very well.

827
01:41:03,287 --> 01:41:06,711
Oh yes! A hotel is going to be
inaugurated this Sunday.

828
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:11,875
Some important members of the MlZlA
group are expected to be there.

829
01:41:11,863 --> 01:41:13,615
Will you take me there?

830
01:41:21,038 --> 01:41:23,552
- Let's go inside and relax.
- Where?

831
01:41:25,877 --> 01:41:27,230
ln the bedroom.

832
01:41:29,147 --> 01:41:32,469
l've loved once. l can't fall in
love again, Neelima.

833
01:41:34,118 --> 01:41:37,940
l am already in love with someone
else. l want you as a friend.

834
01:41:41,659 --> 01:41:45,015
l don't have anyone to whom l
can speak my heart. l...

835
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:53,018
l understand. l was merely
putting you to a test.

836
01:41:57,909 --> 01:42:00,025
l promise to be a true friend.

837
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,535
l'll be leaving now.

838
01:42:10,555 --> 01:42:13,308
- Wait... here's your diamond ring.
- Why?

839
01:42:17,929 --> 01:42:20,944
l've found a true friend.
l don't need a stone.

840
01:42:23,935 --> 01:42:25,550
Please take it back.

841
01:42:45,957 --> 01:42:47,504
What are you up to?

842
01:42:47,124 --> 01:42:50,275
Do you know how for the sound
of gunshots travels?

843
01:42:49,126 --> 01:42:52,550
l want the men behind the
mannequins to hear the sound.

844
01:42:53,631 --> 01:42:56,987
- Who are ''they''?
- Abu Baba's assassins. The MlZlA.

845
01:42:59,971 --> 01:43:01,017
1 -2-3-4-

846
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:04,391
5-6-7-8-9-10!

847
01:43:07,845 --> 01:43:10,894
Go on counting.
But the count won't be finished.

848
01:43:14,986 --> 01:43:18,808
- D'you know what the MlZlA is?
- How do you know who they are?

849
01:43:18,122 --> 01:43:20,044
Don't ask silly questions.

850
01:43:21,993 --> 01:43:24,814
l've seen more of this world
than you have.

851
01:43:23,794 --> 01:43:27,946
And, am l to contemplate on the
probability that my dreams are dashed?

852
01:43:31,002 --> 01:43:35,052
Are you going to start shooting at
them, to cultivate their enemity?

853
01:43:37,008 --> 01:43:40,728
Explain it to him, Gurbax!
He's a fool! Tell him about MlZlA.

854
01:43:47,184 --> 01:43:51,405
lf not for your own sake, you must
consider your grandpa's aspirations.

855
01:43:53,024 --> 01:43:56,016
Forget not that parents
take the place of God.

856
01:43:57,361 --> 01:44:00,615
And your grandfather is all that,
and more, for you.

857
01:44:01,932 --> 01:44:05,151
l know that my grandfather has
designed my destiny.

858
01:44:07,038 --> 01:44:09,461
l know that he had
sired my father.

859
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:13,465
But that poor fellow, Abu Baba was
like a mother to me.

860
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:18,603
Amidst his poverty, he cared for
me for 1 7 long years.

861
01:44:21,052 --> 01:44:24,169
He was my mother... in the true
sense of the erm.

862
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:28,711
l won't spare the ones who
killed my mother.

863
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:35,587
l won't spare!
Be it even my father!

864
01:44:40,738 --> 01:44:42,251
Did you hear that?

865
01:44:45,076 --> 01:44:47,931
He's my grandson... and what
did he tell me!

866
01:44:51,415 --> 01:44:54,134
- KK Singh speaking.
- What's the matter?

867
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:00,543
The new hotel is being inaugurated
with a disco party. You must be there.

868
01:45:04,195 --> 01:45:07,653
l've told you that l'm in no
mood to attend any parties.

869
01:45:08,466 --> 01:45:12,516
Mr.David from Singapore is here.
And, l've already committed to him.

870
01:45:16,474 --> 01:45:18,795
l see... all right. l'll be there.

871
01:45:25,116 --> 01:45:27,937
He disconnected the line...
seemed worried.

872
01:45:30,121 --> 01:45:33,670
Looks like the grandson will be
the grandfather's nemesis.

873
01:45:33,557 --> 01:45:37,106
And along with him, the MlZlA
group will also be run down.

874
01:45:40,264 --> 01:45:43,188
Wait and watch... the colours of
this season.

875
01:45:47,471 --> 01:45:49,462
The colours of this season!

876
01:45:49,206 --> 01:45:52,562
-Who's dancing at the party tonight?
- Miss Singapuri.

877
01:45:53,711 --> 01:45:57,568
Miss Gina Singapuri has run away!
We can't do anything about it!

878
01:45:59,216 --> 01:46:00,365
l'm ruined!

879
01:46:04,155 --> 01:46:07,670
lf the dance is cancelled,
the bosses will shoot us dead.

880
01:46:08,325 --> 01:46:10,043
- Goodness!
- Oh yes!

881
01:46:10,161 --> 01:46:13,710
lf it isn't Gina, let it be Rina!
Or, Teena! Do something!

882
01:46:15,766 --> 01:46:19,281
Don't you worry! Rina, if not
Gina! And Tina if not Rina!

883
01:46:24,175 --> 01:46:26,530
Kolhapuri be it,
if not Singapuri!

884
01:46:27,611 --> 01:46:30,830
- Kolhapuri?
- Clean solution! Durga's mother is...

885
01:46:31,282 --> 01:46:35,002
... in the hospital. Durga
needs money. And we need a dancer.

886
01:46:38,789 --> 01:46:41,940
Didn't l tell you that l won't
dance at any hotel?

887
01:46:41,192 --> 01:46:45,515
lt's a matter of the prestige of his
hotel. And, it's a matter of my job.

888
01:46:46,197 --> 01:46:50,054
- We'll pay you as much as 5000.
- Oh yes! We'll pay a huge sum.

889
01:46:49,433 --> 01:46:51,981
What a shame!
l won't dance half-clad.

890
01:46:52,203 --> 01:46:55,855
- l won't wear this dress.
- lf you don't, l'll be stripped!

891
01:46:59,376 --> 01:47:02,891
- l'm not concerned.
- What Kolhapuri is this, Superman?!

892
01:47:05,082 --> 01:47:08,336
Superman wasn't made out of
nothing! Now, pour some.

893
01:47:12,089 --> 01:47:14,910
Let me make a convert out of
Ms. Kolhapuri.

894
01:47:17,228 --> 01:47:20,777
When you're hot-headed, try
a cool drink. Go on. Drink it.

895
01:47:22,233 --> 01:47:23,780
Go on. Drink it up.

896
01:47:24,902 --> 01:47:28,759
He's the one who is stinking. You
should think of your mother...

897
01:47:29,006 --> 01:47:34,364
... and the operation theatre,, the
doctors,, the darkness,, the light...

898
01:47:35,312 --> 01:47:39,430
- What kind of a Thums Up is this?
- Not Thums Up. lt's ''Comes Up''!

899
01:47:39,717 --> 01:47:42,766
lt bring out the artiste
within you. ln a flash!

900
01:52:26,537 --> 01:52:27,856
ls this hotel!

901
01:53:28,765 --> 01:53:30,915
The old man never
came inside.

902
01:53:32,803 --> 01:53:34,816
ls the girl inside the room?

903
01:53:37,608 --> 01:53:40,224
Make sure you go on
taking photographs.

904
01:53:41,044 --> 01:53:43,296
- What's the room number?
- 326.

905
01:53:50,487 --> 01:53:54,708
The blossom and the spirits... they
have always been together, my love.

906
01:53:58,962 --> 01:54:01,283
- Who is it?
- The bell boy, Sir.

907
01:54:01,899 --> 01:54:05,221
Don't you seen a ''DO NOT DlSTURB''
sign on the door?

908
01:54:04,902 --> 01:54:07,757
An urgent letter for you.
From one Mr.Mizia.

909
01:54:07,638 --> 01:54:08,627
MlZlA?!

910
01:54:13,977 --> 01:54:15,296
Give it to me.

911
01:54:51,915 --> 01:54:54,964
You have the right to tear
him to pieces, Durga.

912
01:54:59,189 --> 01:55:00,235
Beat him.

913
01:55:05,028 --> 01:55:06,040
Hit him!

914
01:55:26,883 --> 01:55:28,737
Take Durga away, Neelima.

915
01:55:34,725 --> 01:55:36,477
Now comes the question.

916
01:55:36,793 --> 01:55:39,148
Who's the boss of the
MlZlA group?

917
01:55:39,796 --> 01:55:41,047
l don't know.

918
01:55:41,064 --> 01:55:42,577
- You know.
- No!

919
01:55:50,741 --> 01:55:54,859
You know it! Who's the boss of the
MlZlA group which killed Abu Baba?

920
01:56:31,848 --> 01:56:34,362
Abu Baba has saved
your life, Ponchy.

921
01:56:54,805 --> 01:56:58,263
Sobhraj Singh! Did l not warn you?
But you have done it!

922
01:57:15,559 --> 01:57:16,912
Who killed him?

923
01:57:25,836 --> 01:57:27,349
Who killed Ponchy?

924
01:57:28,004 --> 01:57:29,653
Your grandson, Kunal.

925
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:31,791
You're lying!

926
01:57:32,843 --> 01:57:35,095
What use is it losing
your head?

927
01:57:36,246 --> 01:57:40,171
One of my men can show you some
photographs. Take a look at them.

928
01:57:44,855 --> 01:57:47,471
The negative of this
photographs is me.

929
01:57:49,659 --> 01:57:51,980
What do you want?
- The exchange.

930
01:57:52,863 --> 01:57:56,481
One of my men standing over there
can give you some papers.

931
01:57:59,536 --> 01:58:02,528
l'd like to have your
signature on the papers.

932
01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:07,191
lt is a deed of sale. l've bought
Kunal Shipping Corporation from you.

933
01:58:10,447 --> 01:58:14,201
What won't parents do to save their
children from the gallows?

934
01:58:16,887 --> 01:58:20,641
l like your move, Jagavar. l'll
sign the papers immediately...

935
01:58:23,693 --> 01:58:27,311
... and have them send over
to you. Your man will carry it.

936
01:58:25,595 --> 01:58:26,710
Thank you.

937
01:58:28,899 --> 01:58:30,617
Sounds like he's here.

938
01:58:39,910 --> 01:58:41,958
Stop right there, Mr.Sobhraj.

939
01:58:45,115 --> 01:58:49,165
l have brought the papers of the
Kunal Shipping Corporation for you.

940
01:58:50,187 --> 01:58:53,236
You've committed a grave
mistake today, Sobhraj.

941
01:58:54,257 --> 01:58:57,010
Your papers and your life are
in my hands.

942
01:59:03,366 --> 01:59:05,880
But, l haven't signed the
papers yet.

943
01:59:09,606 --> 01:59:11,756
l want to sign them before you.

944
01:59:11,474 --> 01:59:12,896
Let him come in.

945
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:27,877
You'd said that you never sell
anything that bears Kunal's name.

946
01:59:30,961 --> 01:59:33,179
Jagavar takes whatever he wants.

947
01:59:34,864 --> 01:59:37,583
But, you've asked for
a price too paltry.

948
01:59:38,768 --> 01:59:42,226
For my grandson's sake,
l would've given you all l have.

949
01:59:45,976 --> 01:59:49,230
All you need to do, as of now
is to sign the papers.

950
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:52,894
l always sign papers
with my own pen.

951
01:59:54,985 --> 01:59:56,202
As you wish.

952
02:00:00,056 --> 02:00:04,049
The gun is a small one. But, it can
blow out your brains, Jagavar.

953
02:00:05,662 --> 02:00:07,983
Ask your pawns to drop their guns.

954
02:00:09,266 --> 02:00:10,619
Drop your guns.

955
02:00:13,903 --> 02:00:18,055
Those who don't know the basics of
crime, mustn't try to write a book.

956
02:00:21,011 --> 02:00:24,833
lf you want to survive, you must
start learning from ''A-B-C''.

957
02:00:26,016 --> 02:00:30,339
Ask your moll to get the negatives
here before you've counted till ''Z''.

958
02:00:35,025 --> 02:00:37,846
- Go on. Tell her.
- Go. Get the negatives.

959
02:00:39,396 --> 02:00:42,149
Now, say the lesson.
... Start with ''A''.

960
02:01:18,068 --> 02:01:19,888
Here are your negatives.

961
02:01:26,076 --> 02:01:27,896
You just saved his life.

962
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:33,436
Now, you must escort me to my
car as a good host does.

963
02:01:34,084 --> 02:01:36,132
Come on. About turn... Hurry.

964
02:01:41,224 --> 02:01:43,875
Stop! Don't! Else, he'll
shoot the Boss.

965
02:01:47,097 --> 02:01:51,249
Didn't l tell you that l don't sell
anything that's named after Kunal?

966
02:01:52,102 --> 02:01:53,524
Here. Take that.

967
02:02:02,445 --> 02:02:05,767
Who invited Jagavar to the
disco party the other day?

968
02:02:05,515 --> 02:02:07,528
l did!
- Listen KK Singh...

969
02:02:09,319 --> 02:02:13,642
Jagavar may be your friend. But for
all of us, he's a snake-in-the-grass.

970
02:02:16,893 --> 02:02:20,044
- lt's time for introspection.
- What do you mean?

971
02:02:22,132 --> 02:02:25,386
Why was your grandson photographing
us at the party?

972
02:02:27,537 --> 02:02:31,553
Why does he do such a thing? lf he
goes on, we'll get into trouble.

973
02:02:35,879 --> 02:02:38,097
And, he'll get into trouble too.

974
02:02:56,833 --> 02:02:58,186
Come over here.

975
02:03:02,705 --> 02:03:05,754
ls that how you repay the love
l have given you?

976
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:13,695
ls this the outcome of what
l've strived all my life for?

977
02:03:13,183 --> 02:03:16,607
- What have l done, Grandpa?
- And that's what he asks!

978
02:03:18,621 --> 02:03:22,443
What have you done! You have killed
someone! You're a murderer!

979
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:31,751
You've cheated me! You've cheated
your mother and your innocent father!

980
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:41,098
You're destroyed everything!
You're destroyed my dreams!

981
02:03:42,212 --> 02:03:44,863
What an end to the dreams
l have dreamt!

982
02:03:44,013 --> 02:03:45,264
Shame on you!

983
02:04:02,031 --> 02:04:04,682
Take this. Grandpa... beat me
some more.

984
02:04:06,736 --> 02:04:09,193
Beat me up... cut me up
into pieces.

985
02:04:12,809 --> 02:04:16,666
But, l won't give up until l've
hacked the MlZlA gang to pieces.

986
02:04:17,914 --> 02:04:21,634
And what are you going to do?
Are you going to kill everyone?

987
02:04:22,252 --> 02:04:25,471
Till now, l haven't killed
anyone. But now, l will.

988
02:04:27,056 --> 02:04:29,775
Till today, you have designed
my destiny.

989
02:04:29,859 --> 02:04:33,181
From this day onwards, l take my
destiny in my hands.

990
02:04:32,795 --> 02:04:36,515
l'll kill with your gun, which
l have taken from your closet.

991
02:04:37,267 --> 02:04:41,124
l'll kill the MlZlA gangsters and
l'll kill the gang-leader too.

992
02:04:45,742 --> 02:04:48,461
What are you doing?
Have you gone insane?

993
02:04:48,278 --> 02:04:51,896
l haven't gone mad, Gurbax.
He's the one who is raving mad!

994
02:04:52,248 --> 02:04:56,400
Oh yes! l'm mad! For Grandpa, it's
only a servant who has been killed.

995
02:04:58,721 --> 02:05:01,042
l've lost a father! A poor father!

996
02:05:04,627 --> 02:05:07,278
Grandpa doesn't want them
to get caught.

997
02:05:06,829 --> 02:05:11,152
And that's became they are his
friends... KK,, Chiang... everyone!

998
02:05:13,303 --> 02:05:17,023
Grandpa is scared of them. He's
scared. But why is he scared?

999
02:05:19,309 --> 02:05:23,234
He is an important person in this
city. And he runs scared! Why?!

1000
02:05:28,117 --> 02:05:32,110
l don't want any help to fight the
ones who have killed my father.

1001
02:05:47,804 --> 02:05:51,854
You're the root of all problems.
Had you not objected to the girl...

1002
02:05:53,209 --> 02:05:57,066
... had you not broken her heart...
had you not sent her away...

1003
02:05:55,345 --> 02:05:59,964
,,Abu Babu would've been alive. And
Kunal wouldn't have left this house.

1004
02:05:59,515 --> 02:06:01,870
lt's a do-or-die situation for him.

1005
02:06:05,355 --> 02:06:07,676
His heart is broken in this world.

1006
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:14,285
Had he been married to Durga, he
would've been a responsible man.

1007
02:06:15,531 --> 02:06:17,988
He wouldn't have thought
of revenge.

1008
02:06:18,568 --> 02:06:22,561
Why won't you let him marry Durga?!
Let him have the one he loves!

1009
02:06:27,377 --> 02:06:31,370
l'll do anything, Gurbax. Please
help me save my crumbling family.

1010
02:06:39,389 --> 02:06:42,005
l can't live here without
him! l can't!

1011
02:06:46,396 --> 02:06:49,217
Don't worry. l'll set everything
all right.

1012
02:06:54,404 --> 02:06:56,952
l have no one, Abu Baba.
l'm helpless.

1013
02:09:51,581 --> 02:09:55,438
l don't know what's gone wrong
between you and your grandfather.

1014
02:09:55,952 --> 02:10:00,070
But l know that your grandpa has
given you more than the heavens can.

1015
02:10:01,591 --> 02:10:05,846
All l want to say is that, unless
you come home, your grandpa might die.

1016
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,657
And l also want to tell you that
your grandfather accepts Durga.

1017
02:10:19,742 --> 02:10:22,893
The two of you must go home
to seek his blessings.

1018
02:10:29,218 --> 02:10:32,233
l'll break your head unless you do
what l said.

1019
02:10:33,256 --> 02:10:37,181
My friend is good man at heart.
That's what you don't know. Come.

1020
02:10:47,937 --> 02:10:49,552
Go on. Forgive them.

1021
02:10:55,645 --> 02:10:57,192
''Sorry''. My foot!

1022
02:10:58,447 --> 02:11:01,996
So he's back! Home comes the Lord
after breaking my heart.

1023
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:07,112
While he was away for a day, l
died! l lost half my life worrying!

1024
02:11:13,663 --> 02:11:16,416
l've lost half my life!
Do you hear that?!

1025
02:11:19,835 --> 02:11:21,382
Dear, remind him...

1026
02:11:22,471 --> 02:11:25,793
lf he can get angry, l can
get angered twice as much.

1027
02:11:26,676 --> 02:11:28,530
l've fathered his father.

1028
02:11:30,346 --> 02:11:33,065
Do you hear that?!
l'm your Father's Dad!

1029
02:11:35,351 --> 02:11:38,275
Do you hear that?!
And the fool stares at me!

1030
02:11:38,688 --> 02:11:39,552
Fool.

1031
02:11:48,698 --> 02:11:51,417
- Come inside, Lady.
- Hold on. You fool!

1032
02:11:51,901 --> 02:11:55,018
A bride doesn't enter a
household in this manner.

1033
02:11:54,704 --> 02:11:59,027
You must do it the traditional way.
Only then will l give away the bride.

1034
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:02,295
And, are you from the bride's kin?!
You change colours like a chameleon!

1035
02:12:04,714 --> 02:12:07,171
Well, all right. lt'll be as you say.

1036
02:12:08,718 --> 02:12:10,174
Let's go in, Son.

1037
02:12:10,786 --> 02:12:13,004
Can l ask you something Grandpa?

1038
02:12:13,222 --> 02:12:15,873
How much do you really love me,
Grandpa?

1039
02:12:19,061 --> 02:12:21,609
More than your father
would ever have.

1040
02:12:22,398 --> 02:12:24,719
l love you very much too, Grandpa.

1041
02:12:24,633 --> 02:12:27,750
- How much?
- More than your son would ever have.

1042
02:12:29,739 --> 02:12:31,354
Time will test that.

1043
02:12:35,745 --> 02:12:38,100
You're 18 years of age as of today.

1044
02:12:38,748 --> 02:12:40,363
My worries are over.

1045
02:12:42,218 --> 02:12:46,439
l'm throwing a party tonight. You'll
become a chairman in 18 companies.

1046
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:50,743
What else?
- And what more would you want?

1047
02:12:52,762 --> 02:12:53,694
Durga.

1048
02:12:56,432 --> 02:12:59,981
Shameless fellow! All right.
l'll announce the engagement.

1049
02:13:01,637 --> 02:13:04,094
Just the announcement?
Nothing else?

1050
02:13:04,774 --> 02:13:07,129
Do you want everything all at once?

1051
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:11,835
Ask Durga's mother to come and
meet me. We must talk things over.

1052
02:13:12,281 --> 02:13:15,330
And we must decide upon a date for
the marriage.

1053
02:13:13,783 --> 02:13:16,104
lt's going to be a grand marriage.

1054
02:13:16,519 --> 02:13:18,976
What do you have
against my Grandpa?

1055
02:13:19,722 --> 02:13:21,576
ls it a crime to be rich?

1056
02:13:30,433 --> 02:13:32,082
l don't understand...

1057
02:13:31,901 --> 02:13:34,449
Come with me. l'll explain
everything.

1058
02:13:36,005 --> 02:13:39,361
He's my husband... back home after
14 years in prison.

1059
02:13:42,978 --> 02:13:46,630
The person who is responsible for
this is none other than...

1060
02:13:45,147 --> 02:13:47,502
- ... your grandfather.
- Grandpa!

1061
02:13:48,317 --> 02:13:50,330
- Let bygones be.
- l must!

1062
02:13:50,152 --> 02:13:52,803
- No!
- Tell him who his grandfather is!

1063
02:13:52,955 --> 02:13:56,311
And what his businesses are!
He's a big time criminal!

1064
02:13:55,825 --> 02:13:58,578
- What do you mean?!
- Let it be, Parvati.

1065
02:13:57,827 --> 02:14:00,819
No! You must tell me all
about my grandfather.

1066
02:14:03,833 --> 02:14:06,051
For my sake... for Durga's sake.

1067
02:14:08,838 --> 02:14:12,296
lt's well known that your
grandfather is with the MlZlA.

1068
02:14:15,344 --> 02:14:18,802
Yes! The MlZlA! Go on...
how is he related to the group?

1069
02:14:19,915 --> 02:14:22,065
He's the chairman of the MlZlA.

1070
02:14:25,121 --> 02:14:26,839
- You're lying!
- No.

1071
02:14:27,923 --> 02:14:29,641
You made it up!
- No.

1072
02:14:30,860 --> 02:14:32,475
No!
lt's the truth.

1073
02:15:33,923 --> 02:15:37,916
According to our reports, its too
dangerous to let that girl live.

1074
02:15:42,364 --> 02:15:46,118
My grandson has come of age.
Today, he joins Kunal lndustries.

1075
02:15:48,938 --> 02:15:51,293
Let us not do anything
gory today.

1076
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:55,763
lf we don't take care of her, she'll
become a problem. She'll destroy us.

1077
02:15:58,948 --> 02:16:01,200
You're the chairman of the MlZlA.

1078
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:03,801
l'm sick of this
chairmanship, Mr.David.

1079
02:16:05,955 --> 02:16:09,948
One can enter the world of crime.
One cannot leave it, Mr.Sobhraj.

1080
02:16:15,397 --> 02:16:19,515
Very well. Let the day pass. But,
we'll keep the girl in our custody.

1081
02:16:31,413 --> 02:16:33,165
Ladies and gentlemen...

1082
02:16:34,783 --> 02:16:38,537
On the 18th birthday of
Sir Sobhraj Singh's grandson, Kunal...

1083
02:16:41,323 --> 02:16:45,942
,, a new mill named Kunal Silk Mills
is being added to Kunal lndustries.

1084
02:16:48,497 --> 02:16:52,012
l've called up everywhere. But,
there's no news of Kunal.

1085
02:16:52,001 --> 02:16:55,357
Send the car over to Durga's house.
He might be there.

1086
02:16:55,004 --> 02:16:58,997
We are eager to see Kunal assume
the chairmanship of this company.

1087
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:03,360
He's expected in a short while.

1088
02:17:03,145 --> 02:17:04,464
Here he comes.

1089
02:17:26,935 --> 02:17:30,052
The management and workers
congratulate Mr.Kunal.

1090
02:17:33,208 --> 02:17:37,429
We expect him to devote every effort
in continuing the success story...

1091
02:17:44,053 --> 02:17:46,806
That is the oath Mr.Kunal
must take today.

1092
02:17:47,656 --> 02:17:51,205
Everyone is waiting anxiously
to hear you speak. Mr.Kunal.

1093
02:18:17,686 --> 02:18:21,304
My grandfather has anointed my
forehead and has bound me...

1094
02:18:25,094 --> 02:18:28,450
...unto truth and honesty.
My grandpa loves me dearly.

1095
02:18:34,103 --> 02:18:36,424
Today, l remember Abu Baba fondly.

1096
02:18:39,508 --> 02:18:43,524
Abu Babu... you're sitting here
somewhere amongst us... aren't you?

1097
02:18:46,014 --> 02:18:48,733
D'you see what's
going on here, Abu Baba?

1098
02:18:53,122 --> 02:18:57,047
l can hear Abu Baba speak.
And, l can hear him say that wealth...

1099
02:19:00,396 --> 02:19:04,753
... is amassed at the expense of many
who have been poor. As was Abu Baba.

1100
02:19:10,606 --> 02:19:14,224
These carpets reek of the flayed
skin of men who have died.

1101
02:19:16,979 --> 02:19:21,029
l can hear the screams of labourers
chained to bondage in our mills.

1102
02:19:22,418 --> 02:19:25,774
Has this nation been founded upon
lies and dishonesty?

1103
02:19:26,155 --> 02:19:30,205
Are edifices built upon these vices?
ls that what we've been taught?

1104
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:35,776
l do not want an institution watered
with the blood of the workers.

1105
02:19:38,167 --> 02:19:41,819
l'm a very insignificant person.
And l can't take this oath.

1106
02:19:46,508 --> 02:19:48,226
l don't want anything.

1107
02:19:50,179 --> 02:19:53,330
l beg pardon of my grandfather.
l beg your pardon.

1108
02:20:22,277 --> 02:20:23,699
Are you leaving?

1109
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:25,710
Yes.

1110
02:20:28,016 --> 02:20:32,168
Very well. l won't try to stop you.
But, hear me out before you leave.

1111
02:20:39,795 --> 02:20:43,344
After you have left, l won't be
able to him in this house.

1112
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:48,724
l shall surrender myself to the
law which l've tried...

1113
02:20:49,705 --> 02:20:53,527
... to dodge for many years, while
l have tried to protect you.

1114
02:20:57,312 --> 02:21:00,930
And l won't walk to the gallows
with my head hung in shame.

1115
02:21:10,659 --> 02:21:14,811
l shall hold my head high in pride,
and l shall tell the world that...

1116
02:21:18,267 --> 02:21:21,782
... the hangman's noose is
really a garland of flowers...

1117
02:21:23,272 --> 02:21:25,593
... that my grandson has given me.

1118
02:21:27,609 --> 02:21:30,464
Yes. l am a criminal.
And l've sold my soul.

1119
02:21:33,682 --> 02:21:37,607
l've struck an enemity with God.
And l have rebelled against Him.

1120
02:21:42,024 --> 02:21:44,345
lf l have thieved, it was for you.

1121
02:21:49,298 --> 02:21:52,722
lf l'm a criminal, it's you who
has driven me to crime.

1122
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:57,523
Before Shamsher Singh
breathes his last...

1123
02:21:59,708 --> 02:22:03,326
... he will leave a massage for
every parent in this world.

1124
02:22:05,747 --> 02:22:09,899
l shall ask every parent not to sell
his soul for the sake of a child.

1125
02:22:12,654 --> 02:22:16,806
l shall ask them not to lose sleep,
nor peace for the sake of a child.

1126
02:22:17,225 --> 02:22:21,548
For the child will one day stand to
judge you when he grows up, though...

1127
02:22:19,595 --> 02:22:23,611
... he understands not the frivolous
perspicacity of his demeanour.

1128
02:22:29,671 --> 02:22:33,528
Thus they will measure us and
dispose of us with wretched abuse.

1129
02:22:35,444 --> 02:22:39,198
And such are bound to be abused.
For when a father tries to...

1130
02:22:40,449 --> 02:22:43,964
... amass more wealth than is
necessary for his child;...

1131
02:22:43,352 --> 02:22:47,209
... when he tries be become a
millionaire using unfair means,...

1132
02:22:48,156 --> 02:22:51,705
... such is bound to happen.
They will be abused, Grandpa.

1133
02:22:52,127 --> 02:22:54,675
For, your grandson
isn't proud of you.

1134
02:22:56,365 --> 02:22:57,912
l'm ashamed of you.

1135
02:22:58,834 --> 02:23:01,951
One day, l shall have a
family, and children too.

1136
02:23:02,604 --> 02:23:04,959
And, what am l to tell them? What?!

1137
02:23:05,841 --> 02:23:09,561
Am l to tell my children that
their ancestors were criminals?

1138
02:23:09,177 --> 02:23:13,102
Am l to tell them that this
palatial house is founded upon crime?

1139
02:23:19,388 --> 02:23:23,040
When you have children, and are
forced to live in penury,...

1140
02:23:25,394 --> 02:23:27,851
... your question will answer itself.

1141
02:23:31,466 --> 02:23:35,459
You haven't yet tasted the bitter
fruits of truth and hard labour.

1142
02:23:38,407 --> 02:23:41,422
l have been through the
rigours of a hard life.

1143
02:23:41,443 --> 02:23:44,594
l have never let you live
in the shadow of labour.

1144
02:23:46,415 --> 02:23:48,872
lt was Abu Baba who had protected me.

1145
02:23:52,421 --> 02:23:53,251
Him!

1146
02:23:54,589 --> 02:23:58,741
He taught me the way of honesty and
hard labour. You'd sent me to him.

1147
02:24:00,228 --> 02:24:02,776
The result is what
is happening today.

1148
02:24:02,431 --> 02:24:05,355
Your grandson is leaving
you and your wealth.

1149
02:24:10,439 --> 02:24:11,451
Go away!

1150
02:24:13,875 --> 02:24:18,096
But remember that you aren't leaving
me. You're forsaking your destiny.

1151
02:24:19,848 --> 02:24:23,170
Do you think that you're the
architect of my destiny?

1152
02:24:22,517 --> 02:24:26,772
800 million people are surviving in
this country by dint of hard labour.

1153
02:24:30,692 --> 02:24:32,546
They fend for themselves.

1154
02:24:32,627 --> 02:24:35,983
The architect of their destinies
will lead me to mine.

1155
02:24:36,465 --> 02:24:39,218
l place myself in the
hands of my Creator.

1156
02:25:03,859 --> 02:25:06,680
Your chairman is blinded by
filial concern.

1157
02:25:08,663 --> 02:25:10,984
He opposed the MlZlA convention...

1158
02:25:10,932 --> 02:25:14,925
... in preventing Neelima from
being executed. Why did he do that?

1159
02:25:15,103 --> 02:25:17,355
The girl is still in our custody.

1160
02:25:18,507 --> 02:25:21,761
She's small fry. You can't
prevent a greater threat.

1161
02:25:23,411 --> 02:25:25,834
Sobhraj has everyone scared witless.

1162
02:25:27,382 --> 02:25:30,840
What you need is a good leader
... a competent chairman.

1163
02:25:31,620 --> 02:25:35,545
Kunal killed your son, KK. Now,
he's plotting to kill all of you.

1164
02:25:39,528 --> 02:25:42,782
The revolt against his grandfather
is proof of that.

1165
02:25:43,532 --> 02:25:46,547
lf you don't decide on this
in a few minutes...

1166
02:26:02,651 --> 02:26:06,576
KK speaking. Please come to an
urgent meeting of the MlZlA group.

1167
02:26:06,688 --> 02:26:08,804
- l can't attend.
- You must.

1168
02:26:09,558 --> 02:26:12,209
lt's a matter of Kunal's
life and death.

1169
02:26:18,633 --> 02:26:21,682
Your grandson Kunal is a
potential threat to us.

1170
02:26:25,574 --> 02:26:29,692
lt has been the convention that we
eliminate threats when threatened.

1171
02:26:30,579 --> 02:26:34,436
We have decided unanimously, to
eliminate Kunal within 24 hours.

1172
02:26:41,189 --> 02:26:43,908
Are you aware how Kunal is
related to me?

1173
02:26:46,828 --> 02:26:50,150
- Do you know who he is?
- Questions pertaining to...

1174
02:26:49,698 --> 02:26:52,690
... emotions and relationships
are irrelevant.

1175
02:26:52,334 --> 02:26:56,259
The question is relevant, because
you know how much l love Kunal.

1176
02:26:59,207 --> 02:27:02,927
Did you care for my feelings
when you had my son-in-law shot?

1177
02:27:06,047 --> 02:27:08,504
What of the murder
of my son Ponchy?

1178
02:27:09,618 --> 02:27:13,167
Don't speak like that KK.
You know that Kunal is innocent!

1179
02:27:15,223 --> 02:27:17,236
l'll reason it out with him.

1180
02:27:18,493 --> 02:27:22,213
You are free to take everything
except my child away from me.

1181
02:27:30,071 --> 02:27:33,825
l promise you that l shall take
him away to someplace faraway.

1182
02:27:35,176 --> 02:27:38,498
lf the chairman himself wants
to violate the rules...

1183
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:40,996
... he forfeits his right
to the chair.

1184
02:27:40,382 --> 02:27:42,532
l don't want this chairmanship.

1185
02:27:42,250 --> 02:27:45,367
We had guessed this outcome
earlier, Mr.Chairman.

1186
02:27:48,056 --> 02:27:51,173
Which is why we've already
chosen a new chairman.

1187
02:27:51,993 --> 02:27:54,211
And, we've passed the order too.

1188
02:27:53,828 --> 02:27:56,376
Our new chairman is
Jagavar Chowdhary.

1189
02:28:01,803 --> 02:28:05,159
l don't think it pleases you to
meet the new chairman.

1190
02:28:08,677 --> 02:28:12,397
But it's your own MlZlA group
that accords me such an honour.

1191
02:28:13,682 --> 02:28:16,139
And as of now,
you are under arrest.

1192
02:28:39,708 --> 02:28:42,256
A vulture cannot
masquerade as a lion.

1193
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:46,597
Remember it.

1194
02:28:47,482 --> 02:28:50,701
l shall never let your
malafide intentions succeed!

1195
02:29:01,296 --> 02:29:03,446
Where has he gone?
Follow him!

1196
02:29:54,049 --> 02:29:56,472
l'm not related to
Grandpa anymore.

1197
02:29:56,251 --> 02:29:58,674
l have no wealth,
nor any standing.

1198
02:29:59,788 --> 02:30:02,939
Still, l've come to seek
Durga's hand in marriage.

1199
02:30:02,457 --> 02:30:05,608
- The decision lies in your hands.
- But, Kunal...

1200
02:30:05,593 --> 02:30:07,584
Fantastic! What a grandson!

1201
02:30:10,131 --> 02:30:12,486
Lucky was the mother
who bore you.

1202
02:30:13,535 --> 02:30:15,992
- You?
- You're lucky to have him...

1203
02:30:17,906 --> 02:30:21,421
... for a son-in-law. He has
forsaken millions in wealth.

1204
02:30:23,211 --> 02:30:27,363
You'd never find such a gem of a
person. Everyone's talking about him.

1205
02:30:29,217 --> 02:30:32,334
- But... who are you?
- We have very little time.

1206
02:30:32,253 --> 02:30:36,303
Your grandfather and the MlZlA
are plotting to kill you in 24 hours.

1207
02:30:38,827 --> 02:30:42,479
- l'd like to see that happen.
- Don't be foolish. Run away!

1208
02:30:42,964 --> 02:30:44,716
You're in grave danger!

1209
02:30:50,004 --> 02:30:53,553
MlZlA assassins are after you!
They're the ones attacking.

1210
02:30:53,508 --> 02:30:55,863
We have no time to think.
Move it!

1211
02:31:21,269 --> 02:31:22,782
Durga and Kunal...

1212
02:31:23,671 --> 02:31:27,323
- Why? What happened?!
- Jagavar Chowdhary has abducted them.

1213
02:31:28,610 --> 02:31:31,033
That's true.
l've seen them myself.

1214
02:32:24,332 --> 02:32:25,754
Where's Jagavar?

1215
02:32:50,558 --> 02:32:52,913
- Do you remember, Balloo?
- What?

1216
02:32:53,328 --> 02:32:57,253
18 years ago, the drums back in
our village played the same beat.

1217
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:02,915
His father Pratap had called
out at me in a similar tone.

1218
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:06,890
He died the death of a dog.
Poor fellow.

1219
02:33:10,111 --> 02:33:13,763
After my hands are freed, you'll
die a worse death, Jagavar.

1220
02:33:17,051 --> 02:33:18,564
You're hot-headed.

1221
02:33:20,121 --> 02:33:22,339
Please listen to me, Mr.Jagavar.

1222
02:33:22,123 --> 02:33:25,047
This is no time for
an exchange of dialogues.

1223
02:33:24,359 --> 02:33:28,375
Shoot him dead and be done with it.
You don't know his grandfather.

1224
02:33:29,897 --> 02:33:33,014
He'll risk his life
for the sake of his grandson.

1225
02:33:33,001 --> 02:33:36,823
l won't let him die so easily.
His grandpa loves him very much.

1226
02:33:41,142 --> 02:33:43,656
He'll follow the trail
and come here.

1227
02:33:45,313 --> 02:33:47,964
lf he does arrive,
he'll kill all of us.

1228
02:33:48,616 --> 02:33:51,767
He will come. But, he won't
get out of here alive.

1229
02:33:53,488 --> 02:33:56,742
This is Jagavar's house.
And guns trained outside...

1230
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:02,675
... have been ordered to shoot
anyone who tries to enter.

1231
02:34:11,639 --> 02:34:13,994
There he is.
Shoot him if you can.

1232
02:34:26,054 --> 02:34:28,978
You cannot become a chairman
unless l say so.

1233
02:34:28,923 --> 02:34:31,972
l have millions invested
in businesses with you.

1234
02:34:33,061 --> 02:34:36,053
l'll meet you tomorrow
and clarify everything.

1235
02:34:35,730 --> 02:34:37,880
No. l must see you immediately.

1236
02:34:38,333 --> 02:34:41,484
But, the present situation
is fraught with danger.

1237
02:34:42,437 --> 02:34:45,258
Come what may, l must
meet you immediately.

1238
02:34:47,408 --> 02:34:49,421
Where are you speaking from?

1239
02:34:49,510 --> 02:34:52,934
l'll see you at the
China Creek Bridge at 2 a.m. sharp.

1240
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:03,270
- We must get Mr.David over here.
- Our men are guarding all points.

1241
02:35:02,623 --> 02:35:06,138
Which is why you must travel
by my white car. You must...

1242
02:35:05,193 --> 02:35:07,844
... bring Mr.David back
in the same car.

1243
02:35:08,096 --> 02:35:11,611
- Why the white car?
- The guards have been instructed...

1244
02:35:12,500 --> 02:35:15,924
... to blow up any other car.
Explain that to Mr.David.

1245
02:35:18,906 --> 02:35:22,160
Mr.Chiang should accompany you
as he knows Mr.David.

1246
02:35:55,109 --> 02:35:58,363
You are no friend!
Our friendship is no more, is it?

1247
02:36:00,148 --> 02:36:03,663
Yes. Our friendship is over.
My time has come. Not yours.

1248
02:36:06,954 --> 02:36:09,775
- Go away from here.
- Don't talk nonsense!

1249
02:36:09,557 --> 02:36:12,913
We've lived together. And
together will we face death.

1250
02:36:16,531 --> 02:36:18,522
Here come Jagavar's hounds.

1251
02:36:40,788 --> 02:36:42,938
No! Don't shoot!
Listen to me!

1252
02:36:48,196 --> 02:36:49,618
l'm an innocent.

1253
02:36:51,499 --> 02:36:53,114
''Shamsher! Don't!''

1254
02:36:53,301 --> 02:36:56,054
''Forgive me!
ln the name of Lord Shiva!''

1255
02:36:56,370 --> 02:36:58,383
ln the name of Lord Shiva!''

1256
02:36:57,905 --> 02:36:59,759
Please save my life, Sir!

1257
02:37:11,319 --> 02:37:12,934
Do you recognise me?

1258
02:37:17,225 --> 02:37:18,442
Who are you?

1259
02:37:20,228 --> 02:37:21,775
l'm Shamsher Singh.

1260
02:37:24,031 --> 02:37:26,386
Shamsher Singh?!
No! You can't be!

1261
02:37:26,234 --> 02:37:28,885
Shamsher Singh...
Pratap Singh's father.

1262
02:37:50,992 --> 02:37:53,916
l haven't been able to
forget your ugly face.

1263
02:37:57,932 --> 02:37:59,980
Tell me... who was your boss?

1264
02:38:02,737 --> 02:38:05,729
l'll tell you...
... it was Jagavar Chowdhary.

1265
02:43:31,398 --> 02:43:33,719
Not Sobhraj... l'm Shamsher Singh.

1266
02:43:35,936 --> 02:43:38,985
Kunal was born on the same
day that Pratap died.

1267
02:43:41,508 --> 02:43:44,022
On that day,
Shamsher Singh died too.

1268
02:43:47,615 --> 02:43:49,264
And l became Sobhraj.

1269
02:44:36,664 --> 02:44:39,212
Beat him up, Son!
Bash him up, Pratap!

1270
02:44:39,667 --> 02:44:41,658
Don't spare him!
Kill him!

1271
02:44:43,671 --> 02:44:46,094
He's the root cause of our ill luck.

1272
02:44:46,006 --> 02:44:50,227
He's the one who has destroyed our
happiness! He set our lives on fire!

1273
02:44:49,777 --> 02:44:51,392
Don't you spare him!

1274
02:45:15,569 --> 02:45:17,116
There goes Jagavar.

1275
02:45:21,709 --> 02:45:22,926
Follow them.

1276
02:45:23,310 --> 02:45:24,663
Take him along.

1277
02:45:29,249 --> 02:45:30,762
Beat them to pulp!

1278
02:48:11,545 --> 02:48:12,660
My friend!

1279
02:48:13,881 --> 02:48:16,702
- l'm leaving.
- Don't speak so, my friend.

1280
02:48:16,350 --> 02:48:19,171
- For God's sake, my friend!
- l'm leaving.

1281
02:48:42,442 --> 02:48:46,492
You have moulded us out of clay.
We're your humble servants, O'Lord.
